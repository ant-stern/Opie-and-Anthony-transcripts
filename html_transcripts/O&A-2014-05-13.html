<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious discussion about a broken studio chair, blamed on overweight colleagues, escalating into vulgar and offensive commentary about their weight.  This segued into a discussion of the Solange Knowles/Jay-Z elevator fight, heavily featuring leaked security footage and crude speculation about the incident's causes.  The hosts also complained about their pollen allergies and briefly mentioned a deadly virus outbreak.  A listener's call about the difficulty of obtaining a Cronut was dismissed with annoyance.

The show then featured a lengthy, chaotic phone call with an intoxicated woman, "Lady Di," punctuated by arguments and disruptive behavior.  Comedian Colin Quinn joined the call but eventually hung up due to Lady Di's erratic behavior.  Audio of the call was played for the audience.

Following this, the hosts discussed the public reaction to Michael Sam's post-draft kiss, analyzing social media responses, including criticism from former athletes and their subsequent apologies (or lack thereof).  They also addressed a college basketball player who claimed his offensive tweets were a social experiment, met with the hosts’ skepticism. A listener then called to discuss the changing acceptance of intimacy on television in relation to the Sam kiss controversy.

Another segment included numerous listener calls concerning bisexuality, homosexuality, and parallels to the historical reactions against interracial relationships.  A Norm Macdonald bit satirizing parental pride in their child's sexuality was played. The hosts extensively analyzed Donald Sterling's interview with Anderson Cooper, focusing on his apologies, explanations, and attacks on Magic Johnson, including a particularly offensive comment about Johnson’s AIDS status.  They also speculated on Magic Johnson’s motives.  Other topics briefly touched upon included the Eurovision Song Contest winner (described as a bearded woman), the Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapping, a house exploding during a live news report, and Adrian Broner's boxing suspension.  The hosts revisited a 2004 incident where Opie was enraged about a lack of milk, relating it to their firing and the subsequent silence from their fanbase.  A listener also reported on Tommy Lasorda wishing harm upon V. Stiviano, followed by news of Stiviano’s minor car accident.

A later segment involved a discussion of Charles Barkley's perceived lack of apology for offensive comments about San Antonio women and a rumored billboard response.  A listener then complained about Sal's rudeness, leading to a heated exchange and accusations of unprofessional conduct, with several calls both supporting and criticizing Sal. The conversation frequently devolved into sexually suggestive and offensive language and topics, including discussions about gay sex and listener reactions to Michael Sam's kiss.  The segment also included discussion of listener Kenny's use of internet slang ("man-dime").  In-studio guest Roland recounted a Brooklyn Nets game experience.  A significant portion of this segment was dedicated to a retrospective analysis of a 2005 incident where Opie’s anger over a milk shortage was played as audio, with speculation about Opie’s potential blood sugar issues contributing to the outburst. Robert Duvall was mentioned as the next day's guest.

The show concluded with a segment focusing on Opie's intense reaction to receiving his milk late, in a Duane Reade bag, escalating into a prolonged, expletive-laden rant.  The discussion included tangents about King Arthur, Parmalat, and Opie's low blood sugar. Ricky was blamed for the milk procurement.  Casey Kasem's disappearance and speculation about his wife's involvement were also discussed, alongside graphic discussions of self-fellatio and other off-color jokes.  The show also covered Elvis Duran's comments about the show, the ratings of other radio personalities (Scott Shannon, Todd), and a contentious relationship with a frequent guest, "Who Kid."  Nicole, a frequent caller, called in to discuss postpartum recovery and breastfeeding, leading to a conversation about her nipples and breasts.  The Jay-Z/Solange/Beyonce incident and a joke about a missing dog concluded the broadcast.  The regular on-air personalities, Jimmy and Sam Roberts, participated along with numerous callers, but no other named guests were present in the studio besides the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, everybody. Hi, everyone. Hi. Welcome. Greetings. Hello. Morning. Morning. That's one. Good morning.  Can I, uh, can you give me 30 seconds of bitching today? Uh, right, let's start the clock. Only 30 seconds? I'll give you two hours.  Nah, man. They're sick of it. I get it, but they can't even fix a fucking chair around here. 
[00:00:30]  The chair. The chair. Remember the fat fuck rant? Yes. And I let it go after that.  So it might have taken it a little too far. But they still haven't fixed the fucking chair.  They can't even fix a fucking chair for us. We were supposed to get a whole remodel starting next week when we go away.  We're going away for a quick week. That's obviously not happening, even though no, Tim Sabian, Don Wicklund, either guy, they haven't come down the hall and said, yeah, you're right, it's not happening. 
[00:01:00]  No. So. But they can't even fix the fucking chair. The chair.  It's like, oh. How does that look? I don't know. You look like you're up a little high.  Yeah, but I can't adjust it. There you go.  That looks like the normal height.  That might be because I fucking slammed the chair against the wall about ten times.  Yes.  If you think I'd just do it for the radio, you're wrong. I did for Anthony today. 
[00:01:30]  I saw that.  Just fucking slamming the chair against the wall, hoping maybe that'll, you know, get the levers working again. That's good.  I got a stomachache when it happened and I was going to start crying and I wasn't going to be able to go to school.  You love it. You secretly love it.  So you enjoy the chair?  Yes. I want to throw it through that fucking window. I really do.  At least do that.  Oh my God, like the chief.  Now we can all run away. 
[00:02:00]  Whatever.  I mean, it's come down to this.  They don't even feel like fixing a fucking chair for us.  A lousy fucking chair.  Oh boy, this pollen.  This pollen is like crazy in my throat.  I told you.  The algae season is so bad, it's even affecting people that...  Oh, someone wrote me back.  Sam said he switched it out.  It will be there this a.m.  And I will be there this morning and we'll find a fix. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, he switched it out with another shitty chair.  Another broken chair.  Don't fucking pass the buck to Sam.  You should have checked it yourself.  I blame Sam Roberts.  The chairs are shitty around here because we got fat fucks!  God!  Lose some fucking weight!  These chairs would look like they'd be hard to break from your own weight.  No kidding!  You gotta really be fat.  You gotta really be a fat fuck.  Jostling around in the seat back and forth a lot.  Making stress cracks.  If you were a fat fuck, wouldn't you just carefully sit on chairs? 
[00:03:00]  Wouldn't you be fully aware that your fat fuckness is gonna break shit?  It would be embarrassing to break a chair, I think.  It would, right?  Yeah.  The greatest fear of the fat man, breaking a chair.  Oh.  Because my chair was, you know, got fucking broken last week by a fat fuck.  And then I talked...  I got Travis's chair, I guess.  And this has already had its issues.  The one with a fist in the seat?  There's a lot of come with a Heidi Park daughter's mortgage jokes. 
[00:03:30]  Travis, there he is.  But it's fat fucks that don't give a crap about other people's things.  If you're a fat fuck, you should be forced to stand all day and broadcast.  Yeah.  That's true.  We should have a scale at the front door.  Oh.  Because, I mean...  You must be this weight to sit.  Yeah.  Right.  And we should put a little thing, a little post-it on the scale that just says fat fuck,  meaning it doesn't matter how heavy you are anymore. 
[00:04:00]  You're in the fat fuck area.  Fat fuck zone.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be nice?  It would be.  Look, eat all you want until it affects other people.  I don't want your fat fuckness in my seat when I'm flying.  And I don't want you breaking my fucking chair.  It's easy enough.  That's it.  Get out of my way when you're walking down the street.  I saw on Discovery Channel something that cures allergies.  Have you gotten the tips on the allergies yet? 
[00:04:30]  I guess you're supposed to eat local honey from the local bees.  Who put that out?  The local honey makers?  I heard that years ago, yeah.  Oh, really?  What could that possibly do?  I don't know.  They say that the stuff in the local, you're eating local, it adapts you to local pollen  or whatever it would adapt you to.  But if you eat it from the area that you're going to be in, it's supposed to help you with  local allergen.  Yeah.  Get it?  Be in.  Oh, because they make it.  That's a buzzword. 
[00:05:00]  They make it with pollen.  Right.  Yes.  And then it was something like that.  Stop bugging me.  What about the itchy eyes?  Today I got the itchy eyes.  It is very itchy.  Look at the itchy eyes today from now.  It feels like you got like dust in your throat.  Yeah.  Gives me a radio voice.  So I want to thank the allergies for that.  My voice isn't this fucking scratchy and deep when it's not allergy season.  I want to know when the fat fucking apology clock t-shirts are coming out. 
[00:05:30]  Good one.  Oh, damn.  No one would wear a fat.  You can't walk around with a fat fuck t-shirt.  Some people do.  Oh, boy.  You should have a doctor who on it.  What's this deadly virus that is now in the U.S.?  Uh-oh.  Now what do we have to deal with?  Where did they bring it from?  I don't know.  There's like two confirmed cases of some deadly virus spreading to the U.S.  Been there with that every year.  What happened to the bird flu? 
[00:06:00]  It's usually two weeks, so those patients who have been exposed on an airplane in a tight quarter  should be showing these signs.  So if you are one of those 500 people and you've been notified and you're having these symptoms,  you want to make sure you tell your doctor.  Captain Trips?  How long until you come up with an antivirus in a situation like this?  Well, the CDC is working with companies.  Oh, boy.  I was in Florida, too.  That doesn't sound good.  The Merck virus, is that it?  Or Merce?  Is it?  Don't we already have Merce?  Or Mercer?  No, Merce is different.  This is some Mideastern fucking shit. 
[00:06:30]  Don's blaming you for the broken chair.  I just want to let you know that he passed the buck to you, Sam Roberts, because that's  what people do around here.  Why?  Well, you obviously switched out the chair for another broken chair, because that's all  we have around here.  Right.  Do you want to defend yourself?  Because I got a text message from Don saying that, let's see, Sam said he switched it out.  It will be there this a.m.  I will be there this a.m.  and we'll find a fix.  Sam, comment.  And then he writes, so apparently I have to be there every day to fix shit. 
[00:07:00]  Can't depend on anyone.  I will take care of it.  Sam's not dependable.  Oh, Sam, you're not dependable.  He's going to come in with a tool belt on and fucking wrenches, turn that chair over  and fix it, or something that looks like a tool belt.  Yeah.  There's a funny little apparatus on the front.  Something strapped on.  He'll turn the chair over and invite three friends.  You know, I'm not a carpenter.  I'm not a carpenter, so I don't manufacture chairs.  I need a producer.  Who was?  That sounded mean.  I was just kidding.  Jesus. 
[00:07:30]  Jesus was.  Well, let me explain something.  There's a lever on the right side, right?  Yeah.  And if you push it, it goes up or down.  So the fat fuck that's in my seat after me, and I really don't know who, and I don't even  care, it could be many different people, they have to lower this lever down so far to get  their fat fuck thighs onto this console so they could broadcast.  So then when it's time to move it back up so I can tuck my thighs right under the console  because that's how I like it, I can't do it anymore because the lever doesn't work because 
[00:08:00]  the fat fuck broke the mechanism with its fatness.  And the train, it won't stop going nowhere.  That lever worked yesterday.  Huh?  That lever worked yesterday.  All nice?  Yeah, you were using it.  I don't know if I was using it.  Well, then guess what?  It's broken again.  That's why the guy should be forced to stand.  Yeah.  And you know what?  You'll burn a few calories that way.  That would be nice, right?  Standing. 
[00:08:30]  Anyway.  Maybe there's a wooden stool we could just switch out, and we could have a wooden stool  there for every other show.  That would be nice.  And a real nice chair for you.  Right.  Hmm.  I like your outfit.  Thank you.  It's a nice orange long-sleeved paw.  Very orange long-sleeved.  And tan slacks.  Jay-Z got the shit beat out of him by a bitch.  Yeah, he did.  What's that about?  I don't know why, but Beyonce's sister kicked the shit out of him in an elevator.  I think there's some problems between Jay-Z and Beyonce.  Yeah, it would appear that way. 
[00:09:00]  Or Beyonce would have stepped in and said, all right, enough.  But she didn't do anything.  No.  This is just fucking...  Jay-Z physically attacked by Beyonce's sister, Solange.  This is just a sister going crazy on fucking the brother.  For what reason, though?  I don't know.  It could be anything.  I think jealousy.  Jealousy for what?  Beyonce's, you know, the fucking...  She gets a little action because of the relationship.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:09:30]  She probably was pulling all that shit where her neck was fucking going back and forth.  Let me tell you, Jay-Z, you ain't no shit, motherfucker.  And then they get off the elevator and she just can't take it.  She has to fucking go off.  No, they're totally normal.  When the doors open, they're totally normal.  Yeah, Jay-Z probably said something.  Shut up, you fucking chicken-head motherfucker.  And then she was like, what you say, motherfucker?  And they just start, you know.  She's protecting... she's sticking up for Beyonce.  You think?  Oh, yeah, or Beyonce would have gotten involved and said, all right, all right, enough, enough, enough.  She's like, I don't need this shit. 
[00:10:00]  I'm Beyonce.  Oh, here we go.  Everything on the security cameras are going to be released at TMZ if you stay there.  This could be so bad for business because when you go to a hotel like this, there's an expectation of privacy.  Maybe not in the home, it's not in the public places, but in the public area.  What's that?  I know, I'm just saying, privacy in this day and age, it's a problem in that family, for sure.  It's a problem everywhere.  That's exactly right.  Everywhere.  Nothing is private anymore.  Hold on, did they make the same point?  Oh, he did, actually.  Everybody talks.  Yeah, Chris Cuomo does no description.  He does it right every once in a while.  We have privacy every single day in ways we're not even aware of. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  We do it willingly.  And also, it goes hand-in-hand with, we don't do it willingly.  We are to blame.  We don't do it willingly.  What can you do about it?  If you walk out of this building, you're on camera, and what do they say, you know, more than you're not.  So how are you doing that willingly?  What are you supposed to do, walk around with spray paint and find all the cameras as you walk?  Sneak.  Sneak around with a big hat brim on so no one can see you.  I don't know if we're doing it willingly. 
[00:11:00]  I think it's, you know, technology's to the point where you just can't hold it back anymore.  This was obviously a security guy at the hotel who had this security footage and just taped it off of one of the monitors with his phone and sent it out there for everybody to see.  So that's the breach in privacy there, that they say one of the hotel employees should not have done that.  Well, they hired shitty people.  Well, if you've got security guys and security people, they should know that this would be a massive no-no. 
[00:11:30]  But in this day and age where you are being videotaped so much and there are celebrities that are caught on tape like this, there's money to be made by giving these things to websites and getting paid for it.  So the, you know, the temptation's there to take people's privacy and shit all over it for a few bucks.  I don't know why Jay-Z, maybe they didn't think to buy the elevator footage, but like if you're Jay-Z, don't you want that kind of just, don't you go to the hotel and go, look, I want that footage? 
[00:12:00]  Maybe they said no to him?  It might have been too late.  Or maybe they said, look, we're erasing it, but that copy was already, you know, on somebody's phone.  And I'm sure they can fucking, you know, if everybody that walks up to them says, hey, take that shit off your security, they'd be doling out security footage every fucking day.  With him, he's got the money to go to the manager and make it go away.  The juice, he got some juice.  Because that didn't, this didn't happen, this happened when, uh, nine days ago or something?  Yeah, something like that.  Yeah, May 5th, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, so the guy sat on it a while and went, oh man, this is too good.  This is too good, motherfucker.  He was burning a hole in his pocket, he said, I gotta get this shit out there.  So what do you think, Sam?  I think Salaj is kicking the shit out of Jay-Z.  Literally, she starts kicking him.  Oh yeah, she's had no holding it back.  Jay-Z and Beyonce have some kind of issue.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, they must.  They're not as perfect as they would like the world to think.  Uh-oh.  Let's start knocking people off the pedestals.  That's right.  You can't have chicks kicking you and you're wearing like a tuxedo that's like fitted, you know? 
[00:13:00]  It's a relative, though.  It's a fucking little family.  It's a crazy sister-in-law.  It's a crazy sister-in-law, yeah.  You've seen them all.  It's tough to fight in a tuxedo, I would imagine.  Yeah.  You want to look good.  Right.  She was in full twat mode, though.  She'd kick him in the balls.  Oh yeah.  But she didn't just slap him.  She was like a fucking street fighter.  That was world star hip-hop shit right there.  That's right.  You can tell how well trained and everything he is, because he knows that even though he  doesn't see a camera in there, he didn't lift a finger, he's like, there's no fucking way 
[00:13:30]  I'm getting involved in it.  Let your security guys handle it.  Imagine he gave her a bitch slap.  Oh boy.  Oh, that'd be great.  Oh, that'd be great.  Or a full fucking fist punch.  Nice fucking right hook.  Bam!  She goes down.  Yeah.  Be a hero to this radio show.  Hell yeah.  Beyonce is, she's just standing there.  Yeah.  Is she scared of her older sister, you think?  Is it like one of those relationships?  Younger.  Oh, younger sister.  Younger. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  You might know her.  She's just like, oh shit.  Solange has gone nuts again.  You might know her from Yo Gabba Gabba, by the way.  She's had a big hit for Yo Gabba Gabba.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know the song.  I've heard it a thousand fucking times.  I don't know if she's had an actual hit.  She has a Yo Gabba Gabba hit.  Why would they tolerate that?  Why would they tolerate this fucking bitch acting like this in an elevator?  Maybe Jay-Z is in...  That's why there's some shit going on, obviously.  Yeah, maybe he's jeeping.  What does that mean?  Having sex with another woman. 
[00:14:30]  Jeepin'.  And maybe it came out a little bit, and there's Solange going...  When did they come up with that one, Sam?  1993.  Oh, really?  I never heard that.  I've never heard Jeepin'.  I'm immersed in the hip-hop community.  I didn't miss that.  Yes.  Jeepin'.  This is Solange.  Big hit.  Oh, these stupid ads.  There will be ads on every video now.  That's the way of the world.  Just the way of the world, yes. 
[00:15:00]  This is Beyonce's sister.  That's the Yo Gabba theme, obviously.  Here's Solange with Mama Loves Baby.  Mama loves kicking brother-in-law in the fucking walls.  Maybe we can play it the regular way.  Oh, she's just like Beavis. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, boy, she is not Beyonce in the face.  Hannah.  Hannah.  She'll say fucking, uh, the Jeffersons maid.  What was her name?  The older one?  Oh, right.  Oh, man.  How do they not remember that?  My baby loves something.  Listen to my heart.  Maybe.  That sounds about right, actually.  Younger, right?  Nice hairdo.  Yeah, it's awful.  Sisters need them weaves or, you know. 
[00:16:00]  Let it come out a little bit.  Have some fucking product in there or some shit.  She's got it like it's a man.  No guy wants a man hair fucking do on a girl.  That's a fucking could be Eddie Murphy's hairdo.  You know what her Don Cheadle do?  Don Cheadle.  Just pick a guy.  Pick a black guy.  That's her hairdo.  It's not sexy.  She looks like a man. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, she doesn't have the feminine features, really.  If she fucking grew her hair out, straightened it like Beyonce does, wear a weave, a wig, a fucking whatever.  There you go.  There's her sister.  That's all I know from her.  God damn.  Not as successful as Beyonce, right?  Yeah, no.  Not if she's doing fucking just yoga.  Is that her also with the big afro?  Yeah.  Now she looks like Lenny Kravitz.  Yeah?  Wow.  Almost all right there. 
[00:17:00]  Bosschicks.com?  Jesus.  That's got to be a scary sight.  Solange.  It's a land.  Jay-Z was probably trying to do some of that, like, I'm way too famous for this stuff,  where he just kind of doesn't even look at her and just mulls, you've got to shut the fuck up.  And then she just flipped out and started slapping him and kicking him.  Well, she was fighting with her friend that she went with.  Yeah.  She went with some guy who was a friend of hers, and they were fighting earlier, and there was a whole thing that happened in the club.  Jay-Z probably said, knock the shit the fuck off. 
[00:17:30]  You've got to learn when to shut the fuck up, bitch.  Oh, Jay-Z, bitch.  Well, Beyonce stepped in for her sister, of course.  I guess somebody fucking said something at the place they were at, like, what are you doing?  And Beyonce stepped in and was like, you can't talk to my sister like that.  Oh, shit.  Defends her dumb sister, and then it spills into the elevator.  Causes a big fucking boudel.  Jay-Z said, I guess you brought the wrong person.  He said something shitty to her.  Really?  I guess about who she brought, and maybe she just took it out on him, or who knows.  I'd love to hear what she was yelling during that whole thing.  You think she was dropping N-bombs?  Maybe one or two. 
[00:18:00]  I bet.  We should just ask him, or he'll tell us.  Wow, if there was sound on that video while she's kicking and fucking punching.  Put a surveillance camera in the studio.  We used to have one in our old place.  Yeah.  We used to, you know, grab some footage off that every once in a while.  That's how we got Bernie Gatz almost attacking me after I smashed his CD.  Or fake smash.  Fucker.  I didn't actually smash his CD that day.  We want him to, you know, think, I did, though. 
[00:18:30]  And then he comes running in.  Yeah, because you want to taunt Bernie Gatz.  And we captured it on the security camera, because we didn't have video cameras that day.  I will diffuse the problem.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  That was a bit scary.  There it is.  Here's our security camera.  There it is.  Wow.  Nice.  Good thing it's watermark.  You've got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's the thing.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you.  Bernie Gatz. 
[00:19:00]  When did we have this?  Oh, you've never seen this?  Dude, no.  This one, right?  I make him believe I'm breaking his CD.  What are you, motherfucker?  Tony.  Tony.  You're asking for trouble.  You're asking for trouble.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, sit down.  There he comes.  Oh, my God.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  He's pointing.  Oh, Bernie Gatz.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot.  Oh, that was the code word.  The signal.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that. 
[00:19:30]  The burn studio, yeah.  All right.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You're right, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  Burr is taking him on.  It's okay, Paul.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  The master post is in there.  Everything's fine.  It's all right.  Oh, Paul.  Oh, Paul.  I didn't even get that fucking CD.  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic. 
[00:20:00]  You're going to have another.  All right, Bernie.  He's right, Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, Paul.  You tell him to relax.  Paul, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep your CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Oh, he walks out.  But then he comes running back in after he went to his bag.  Yeah, we thought he was coming in with a gun.  Give him his CD.  I hope you ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie.  Bernie. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, he's going into his bag.  Holy shit.  He's going into his bag.  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD.  Bernie.  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never...  It was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Oh, he took a fake...  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, wasn't a CD?  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him into the CD?  Well, Eric's going after him.  Wow.  He's going to shoot you now.  Holy shit.  He was pissed.  He was really...  I think I only saw some of that rage.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps and stands.  He finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it, see?  Ross, I never saw that footage.  That's great.  He got so pissed.  You motherfucker.  You motherfucker.  Was it really that bad of quality, the camera we had from that few years ago?  Yeah, it kind of...  Maybe looks a little degraded there.  Yeah, maybe a little better, but yeah.  What are you going to do?  I mean, the Jay-Z security camera footage isn't much better than that, really. 
[00:21:30]  Because I've said Bob probably has better copy of that.  You think?  Yeah, he's got all the stuff from Steve.  Oh, yeah.  I asked for that back months ago.  From Bob?  Yes.  Just demand it.  We'll take a trip out there, me and you.  And we'll grab it.  Get a roll.  We'll get it and we'll come back.  We'll go to the zoo.  Hang them over the lions.  Right.  Let's say hi to Sal in Staten Island.  Sal.  Manny.  Hello, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I've tried getting through to you guys so many times, I can't believe this is why I got through.  That's crazy. 
[00:22:00]  I'm always listening to you guys every day.  Oh, you should.  On demand, because I'm always at work when you're on.  Fascinating.  I've been here about the Cronut for a while.  And I'm in the Carpenter's Union, so I've got to go to the District Council School, same  building as Hot 97.  The Carpenter's Dream.  Flat as a board and needs a screw.  The Carpenter's Dream is throwing my tools out the window of my car on the highway on the  way to Boston.  More of that.  Not all of us get to do that.  Exactly.  Anyway, so I realize I'm going to school by the Dominic's Bakery.  I tried going yesterday at lunch, and they told me people line up at 6 or whatever. 
[00:22:30]  I get there this morning, and there's like 10 people outside.  I'm like, I could definitely get a Cronut today.  They don't open until 8, and that's the time I start school.  I was looking for Roland online.  I give him a handy through the parents.  I don't know what happened.  What were we talking about?  We always take Cronut phone calls, no matter when they come in.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that's one of the rules here.  One of our things.  He won't make more Cronuts because he likes the little 10 people that line up every day.  So what, his store is open? 
[00:23:00]  No, it won't open until 8, but the people start lining up already, but it won't open until  8.  All right, so that's his hours.  We can't do anything about that.  We're on the same page with him as far as his hours of operation.  Well, if he makes more Cronuts, he's going to lose 10 people that line up every day at  6.30.  But you wouldn't be able to get the Cronut anyway because you can't be there when he  actually opens his store.  Yep.  All right.  Not the best Cronut call, but that's okay.  Arguably the worst.  I have no interest in the Cronut. 
[00:23:30]  The Cronut guy, his store, the line.  Nope.  What?  You're lying.  No, I could.  You're lying.  I literally.  You don't give a turkey?  Don't care one iota about the Cronut guy or the Cronut.  What turned you?  If I never see a Cronut, it wouldn't matter to me.  I don't have any urge to taste a Cronut.  I've had it with the Cronut. 
[00:24:00]  You tired of hearing about it?  Yes.  What turned you on it?  This whole experience that we've had with the Cronut guy.  You were in for a while, but what was it?  I was a little fascinated, caught up with the whole thing, caught up in the whole Cronut  frenzy.  But what turned you?  This whole thing that happened with the last time with Roland and the Cronut guy, and you  know, he's supposed to come in, not come in, and then just hear Cronut, Cronut.  You hear it enough times.  I hate the word Cronut.  Wasn't he on Jenny Hutt's show?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why would he go on a show no one listens to?  Uh-oh. 
[00:24:30]  Huh?  Maybe it's along the same lines of thinking of not making Cronuts enough for enough people.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, well, we go on shows that nobody listens to.  We don't make enough food.  That's weird.  He's done every show but ours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we've been his biggest supporters.  No, apparently not.  We're assholes.  I think it's because he came in in the afternoon one day.  That's what they say, but they could have made a couple hours for us.  He got some ink off of us.  He did?  Yeah, with fucking Wolverine.  Nice.  Wolverine eating a Cronut. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Did you hear about Lady Di yesterday?  I was walking from the studio to the car and then waiting for the car.  Right.  And then when I got into the car, I heard a split second of Lady Di and then the show ended.  So I did not hear any of that.  I swear I have not heard it either.  I want to hear it.  I started reading about it on Twitter and Colin.  How did Colin get involved?  Well, I did that before I left.  See, I didn't even hear that part. 
[00:25:30]  We ended the show with Lady Di babbling.  So I just said, hey, just let her go until she runs out of energy or something like that.  And I was still getting my stuff.  You guys left.  And all of a sudden I saw Colin on the hotline.  So the last thing I did before I left the studio was I just conferenced him in with Lady Di and didn't say anything.  I just waited for him to say hello.  And, of course, he says hello and then she goes with it.  And then they have, what, like a 10-minute conversation?  Yeah.  And then I haven't heard the audio.  But then he left and then, what, it almost became a Jay-Z situation? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Jay-Z, Solange situation?  There was almost a domestic disturbance on the phone.  It's fantastic.  I got to hear it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because Bill, after, I mean, we'll hear the Colin stuff first.  And then Di just stays on the phone and Bill starts arguing with Di about getting off the phone.  And Di refuses to get off the phone, even though she's not talking to anybody.  Oh, that's fantastic.  So. 
[00:26:30]  Just drunk, belligerent.  Right.  I'm starting to think she's an ass.  Oh, God.  You're still in with the Lady Di thing?  Yeah, I can't stand her.  Right.  But I'm in.  Like, I'm fascinated with it.  Right.  Yeah.  Always something new.  Okay.  So we left and said, fuck it, just let her babble.  And then Colin gets on the line with her.  All right, we're going home.  No, no, no.  It was a few years ago.  Yes, it was.  All right? 
[00:27:00]  Just keep her on the phone.  She runs out of energy.  We'll see you guys in the morning.  No, I'm not going to run out of energy.  No, no.  No, no.  But I just want to find out.  You want me to dress in a frigging gown?  Are you there?  I'm not running out of energy.  And what are you doing, playing the silent game on me now?  She finally named a bird.  Hello?  Yeah, I'm right here.  Yes.  Diana.  Yes, it's me.  Oh, good. 
[00:27:30]  What are you going to wear at the thing?  Colin.  Super show.  First of all, who am I talking to?  Colin.  Colin Quinn?  Yes.  Oh, hi, Colin.  How you doing?  Hi.  I just heard your call.  It sounded like something we do need to talk about.  Because even I'm wondering, what am I going to wear?  Do I wear a suit or what?  I'll straight.  Oh, jeez.  I don't have a black tie.  I have dress pants, and I have nice shirts. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, I have the same.  I'm going to wear a jacket, but I don't have a tuxedo, for crying out loud.  You don't have a tuxedo?  Yes, you do.  For crying out loud.  I have one from years ago, but I haven't worn it, and I don't even know where the hell  or what it looks like.  It's probably got most balls.  Who knows?  Colin, listen to me.  All right.  First of all, is this really Colin Quinn?  No.  I'm playing a joke on me.  All right.  All right.  Now, but the whole thing is, for me to go out and get a dress gown, you know, for the 
[00:28:30]  bed and everything, I mean, I don't know.  No.  I mean, first of all, I can't believe Marion's not coming.  But second of all, I don't think you should go all, you know, just wear whatever you're  comfortable in.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I think they're making a mountain out of a molehill with this, you know.  The sayings.  They're trying to make it into some big affair.  It's just, you know, it's another thing. 
[00:29:00]  No, I don't mind.  All right, Colin.  I don't mind going.  That is not a big deal for me.  All right.  But the thing is, though, even if I dress nice, I got to buy more jewelry.  Because don't forget, when I got mugged, my jewelry was in my pocketbook.  Yeah.  All right.  Just sold it for crack.  Because it was just costume jewelry.  Right, right.  Well, but everything was in my pocketbook.  Yeah.  I think we should just go casual, you know.  All right. 
[00:29:30]  Now, one more thing.  When is this event taking place?  That's the question.  I don't know.  I thought it was next Tuesday.  But now I'm finding out, you know, other things.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  A playful churple.  No, I don't think so.  By the way, you can hear Colin can't even.  Can he went, ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  His revulsion just snuck through his veneer. 
[00:30:00]  She is just terrible.  Colin acts how it's Seinfeld almost every day.  Ah.  Yeah.  He's going to be in a movie with Amy Schumer, a big part.  Yeah, and he's wasting his time with lady dye.  I bet you he was in the makeup chubby as Judd Avatar was waiting for him when he was talking  to this fucking idiot.  No, I don't think so.  All right.  Now, I have something else I have to say.  June 18th, I have jury duty.  Oh. 
[00:30:30]  And I don't know.  Yeah.  Believe it or not, I have jury duty June 18th.  Believe it or not.  I believe it.  And I don't know if I'm going to be picked for one day, two days.  And I don't know.  I know.  That's how jury duty is.  It's at least two days.  Let's see.  Yeah, at least two days.  Now, did you hear from Sandy Kane?  No, I did not.  All right.  Are you going to tell her to dress up in a gown, too? 
[00:31:00]  Sandy Kane?  No, I just said I don't think we should dress up.  I just said I don't think we should dress up in a gown.  Oh, he's losing it.  I'm just asking.  Did anybody tell Sandy Kane she has to dress up like that?  Yeah.  Like O.P. and Anthony just told me.  Nah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know either.  The whole thing's getting unwieldy.  I do have nice dress clothes, but I don't have a gown.  She doesn't.  Yeah.  Now I hear you. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Well, we'll figure it out.  He's had it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Stay beautiful.  I'll talk to you later.  I love you, too, Colin.  If that's you.  He didn't say.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  So there you go.  The babble.  Colin just couldn't take it after a while.  He's just like, I've had it with this fucking.  Could you imagine her on your jury?  Like she's the one that's got to decide your fucking innocence or guilt.  She's a blithering idiot.  Do you think they get rid of her right away or they keep her in there as the wild card? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  That is a wild card.  You don't know which way she's going to go.  She doesn't even know until the last second.  I seem like a nice enough fella.  Oh, God.  Totally just misunderstanding the facts.  I want to videotape her in that jury room.  Right?  How great would that be?  So anyway, Colin finally had it.  He bails.  And then she was on the whole half hour by herself, right? 
[00:32:30]  Pretty much, yeah.  She just stayed on the phone.  She just stayed on the phone.  So then what was she doing?  Just trying to get our attention again, even though we were long gone?  Yeah, she was saying hello.  And then I think it's in the clip, but you can hear her treating herself to a beverage.  Right.  She got into a big fight with Bill.  Right.  She ended up outside the apartment, still on the phone.  That's all in this clip?  I believe so.  No.  Wait a minute. 
[00:33:00]  No.  Well, go ahead.  Well, get off the phone.  Why do I have to get off the phone?  Because I can't hear what...  If you call, go outside.  Okay.  I'll go outside.  No.  No, I'll go outside and sit with the squirrel.  I don't believe it. 
[00:33:30]  I don't believe it.  You're, um...  Oh, sorry.  You're going to get there.  You've got any numbers.  Hold on.  2-2-1.  Oh, wait.  Oh, what was that? 
[00:34:00]  I can't remember.  I've got my glasses.  You've got your glasses right there.  What?  You're too busy in the fucking phone?  You what?  I'll take that phone and throw it.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm trying to give you the thing.  Here.  That fucking phone's more important?  I'll throw that motherfucker.  I'm going outside.  I'll throw that fucking phone away.  I'm tired of you on that fucking phone. 
[00:34:30]  I'm sick of it, Diana.  This is great.  This is what happens.  This is what happens in that house.  Wow.  When, uh, yeah.  When he doesn't think anybody's...  Right.  ...listening.  Oh, man.  Sit here. 
[00:35:00]  Take this phone.  Get the fuck.  That phone's going.  That phone is...  You have more beer.  You have more fucking more beer.  Every fucking day with you.  It doesn't fucking matter.  You don't feel a fuck. 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  Gunshot.  Oh, good.  Good.  Was that her opening a fucking beer and taking a swig?  Can I hear that again?  That last moment?  Oh, God.  But why is she still on the phone? 
[00:36:00]  Everyone is long gone.  And she's getting into a domestic disturbance over the fact that she's on the phone with nobody on the other end.  Literally nobody.  Except the audience.  The audience, but...  But they can't talk to her.  Exactly.  So technically nobody.  Nobody.  Oh, shoot.  Hold on.  There's the...  You hear the thing?  She can't...  You know what?  She cracks that can open and can't get it to her face fast enough.  Listen to the time it took between the opening of the can to the swig.  Get out of here. 
[00:36:30]  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  What's her dignity trying to come back?  What was she?  Shooing squirrels at that point?  Fighting with a squirrel.  Some fucking...  A pink elephant.  What a fucking mess.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Jesus. 
[00:37:00]  That's pretty much how it ended.  Yeah.  So, wow.  She is a disaster.  It's a nice healthy glug, too, wasn't it?  Yeah.  That was.  That was a real refreshing sip.  Get out of here.  Nice refreshing sip.  Yeah.  That was refreshing.  10 in the morning, and they're drunk, and he wants her off the fucking phone.  How great is that?  He's had it.  He's had it.  Every day with that phone, did he say?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Is he annoyed with her?  That was a little different yesterday. 
[00:37:30]  Man, I suck my cock.  I bet that's yelled.  Get over here.  Earn your keep around here.  I don't know what the relationship is.  Seems a little strange.  It's not a healthy one.  No, no, no, no.  So, there you go.  That's how the show ended yesterday.  Wow.  And we're hearing it for the first time.  It's our channel.  Yeah.  I just said, let them go.  See what happens.  Whatever.  I heard that last get out of here when I got into my truck and drove away. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, that was all you heard?  That was all I heard, yeah.  That was her fighting with the squirrel.  Yeah.  And then, of course, the boys made this as we go to break.  Uh-oh.  They tried to make me go to rehab.  I said...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black, but when I come back...  No, no, no, no, no.  I do not mo' crack.  I gave out the time. 
[00:38:30]  And if my daddy thinks I'm fine...  They tried to make me go to rehab.  Have I said...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The only time that you're addicted is when you're actually doing it.  Ah, former Giants player says that, gay or not, the kiss was disgusting to see on TV. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, shit.  People are still talking about the kiss, huh?  That was the big talk yesterday.  Yeah, some people missed our point.  Yeah, yeah.  It was...  It's just...  It's just...  Something you don't see every day.  Yeah.  I like it, though.  That's on you.  No, man.  It's like something you just don't see every day.  So it's a little...  Relax.  Was I bothered to the point where I had to turn the TV or look away? 
[00:39:30]  No, none of that.  But it was just something unusual and different.  One of the players was saying he's not taking down one of his tweets, not apologizing, because  he should have the right to say what he wants to about certain things.  A college player?  Without fear of repercussions like that.  Was it the college player or somebody in the NFL?  I caught a quick glimpse on the news about it.  It might be the next player.  But it's kind of cool, like, I think some people are just starting to push back a little 
[00:40:00]  bit, especially on Twitter, because now this apology thing is just getting ridiculous.  And a lot of people are noticing the insincerity of it, how stupid it is, how useless they are,  phony.  And they're saying, you know, no, I'm not going to...  You know what?  No.  Good for them.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're just trying to go 10 days without an apology. 
[00:40:30]  And by the way...  Good luck.  We didn't go a day.  We got one today.  No, we got an apology for somebody else.  Another one of those.  We'll get into that in a minute.  Oh, it's fantastic.  But I think the one you're talking about, former Giants player...  Okay, this was the one I...  Maybe that's him.  But there's two players, and there's a college player.  So I'm not sure which one you're talking about.  Let me see here.  Former Giants running back Derek Ward, a member of the team's Super Bowl championship team in 2007,  slammed ESPN for showing Michael Sam kissing his boyfriend after he became the first openly 
[00:41:00]  gay player drafted by the NFL.  Ward, who retired from the Texans in 2012, said the Sports Network's decision to run footage  of the kiss after the St. Louis Rams selected Sam on Saturday set a bad example for children.  Wow.  But he doesn't...  He says it's not a gay thing.  He said it was the tongue thing that bothered...  Like, it was too in-depth.  He said he would complain about the same thing.  It was a man and a woman.  And boy, they did zoom right in on them fucking smooching.  Why is ESPN showing a kiss like that?  Why are all the papers showing it if it's not something different or something? 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Of course it is.  Sensational.  Because if a straight player gets drafted and he's kissing his girlfriend or wife,  it's not going to be on the front page anywhere.  And they're not going to zoom in.  Like you said, they zoomed in.  They're like, get that fucking...  Right.  Get the gay kiss.  Because they knew that would get a reaction from a lot of people.  All right, so this is what he wrote.  He said, man, you got little kids looking at the draft.  Ward griped on Twitter Saturday.  I can't believe ESPN even allowed that to happen. 
[00:42:00]  But black guys, man, they are the most critical, I've noticed, in my opinion.  I've noticed black guys are the most critical about gays.  They really are not happy when there's outward gay people doing their little gay things in front of black dudes.  You don't think they're as accepting as maybe other races?  Which is oddly odd, because, you know, the oppression that they've overcome and the, we shall overcome, all that. 
[00:42:30]  You'd think there would be some kind of camaraderie there.  But a lot of black fellas, they do not like that whole gay lifestyle thing.  But they hate when it's equated.  They hate when their struggle is equated with the gay struggle.  But they enjoy a good million-man march.  Yeah, well, who doesn't?  It's a lot of downtime.  Yeah.  A lot of men.  A lot of men.  I think this is the guy you're talking about, because he didn't back down. 
[00:43:00]  His tweet sparked outrage.  Of course.  Everyone who comments on my page saying what dude did was fine is getting blocked, Ward tweeted.  So far, I've blocked 10 people.  He went on to tweet that putting your tongue into the other person's mouth is a little overboard.  But people seen that as, oh, I'm bashing him because he's gay.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  When a heterosexual couple goes all in like that, it's kind of a little...  It's a little, yeah.  It takes you back a little bit. 
[00:43:30]  Like, ooh.  So, that's the first one.  I think that's the one you're talking about, where he refused to, like, apologize or take  down his tweets.  Then you got Marshall Henderson.  Former Ole Miss basketball star Marshall Henderson said Monday that his derogatory tweet about  linebacker Michael Sam was meant as a project to gather information for a friend who is deciding  whether to tell family and friends about a sexual orientation.  Ah.  Oh, so this guy's in trouble.  And now he's doing the old Pete Townsend. 
[00:44:00]  The old Pete Townsend research angle.  Oh, okay.  This guy's panicking.  Yeah.  Because he spoke his mind on Twitter.  And as we're learning day by day here, you just can't do that anymore.  No.  My stance on gay athletes is irrelevant, Henderson told ESPN by phone.  The whole reason we chose to do this is because my friend is gay.  If it was wrong for me to do it, so be it.  God, he's just lying.  But I guess you've got to lie to save your ass.  Did he have to find a gay friend real quick?  Right.  Henderson tweeted the following on Monday morning, two days after Sam was taken by the Rams. 
[00:44:30]  Here's the tweet.  Boycotting SportsCenter till this Michael Sam.  Nasty.  Nasty and then expletive in parentheses is off.  Sam nasty.  Nasty shit.  Is off.  My brothers are 7 and 11 and saw that.  Sickening.  So how is he doing that for, how is that research for his friend?  So then he looks at his responses that he gets, all of his responses.  And then the gay guy can gauge like, oh, is the public accepting? 
[00:45:00]  Are they not accepting?  Oh, God, he's just a liar.  Who's more critical?  And that's how he'll gauge whether he tells his parents.  But he has to lie, you know.  Oh, boy.  An hour later, Henderson followed with tweets explaining his rationale for the initial comment.  Ah.  One of my best friends, who is gay, is about to graduate in psychology.  Asked me to say these things so he can respond, so he can responses.  TBC.  What does TBC mean?  Taking care of business?  To be continued.  To be continued. 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  Taking care of business.  The point of his study was to see how people react when others say things or act a certain  way against another group of people.  TBC.  To be continued.  Right.  Henderson told ESPN that his friend, who does not attend Ole Miss, asked him to tweet out  something on Sam a couple of weeks ago, but he declined at the time.  This is just all...  TNB.  TBC.  TBC.  Tiny Black Hawk.  These are all just lies, right?  They're all lies.  Okay.  He's fucking peddling as fast as he can.  However, after watching Sam get drafted and seeing his younger brother's reaction to the 
[00:46:00]  display of affection between Sam and his boyfriend on TV, Henderson decided to post a comment  on Twitter.  After a flurry of backlash, Henderson sent another tweet less than an hour later saying,  I'm sorry, but I do not agree whatsoever that should be shown to where innocent eyes  can see.  Did you understand that?  Yeah.  But I do not agree whatsoever that should be...  That should be shown...  All right.  That should be shown to where innocent eyes can see.  All right.  I saw their reaction and thought, we've got something brewing here, Henderson said. 
[00:46:30]  I knew I was sticking my neck out there doing it, but I wanted to see how people reacted.  What better way to get research and feedback than to do it like I did, Henderson added.  Everything I did is a psychologist and educator's dream.  Oh, my God.  He later tweeted, thank you, Michael Sam, for standing up for you and making this whole  project possible.  Thank you.  This project.  It's the cap one day at a time.  It's way over the top now. 
[00:47:00]  Well, that was all in capital.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, look at me.  I'm helping.  He's just lying.  Of course.  But I've changed my tune on that.  Unfortunately, you've got to lie in this day and age, because they're ready to just crucify  you, even if you do apologize for doing something wrong, or what could be perceived as something  wrong.  And the boyfriend, they're saying in the paper, his family was all mafia.  They may have mixed emotions about this one.  Wow. 
[00:47:30]  You ever watch The Sopranos?  Remember what happened?  Well, if my son has held down and sodomized by defensive linemen, this I will not forgive.  Forced to leave after this Michael Sam kiss business.  Yeah, that's just, that culture isn't very accepting either. 
[00:48:00]  They're really not very open about that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just bothered, because he's an average draft pick right now, and he's getting so  much attention.  Well, that whole gay thing.  So much attention.  Joey in Virginia.  Joey.  Joey!  Hey, you there?  Yeah, what's up, Joey?  Oh, yeah.  What's up, guys?  And it's Tony, no matter what.  Oh, sorry, Tony.  Real quick.  I see the reason why all these people are pissed off. 
[00:48:30]  Let's be honest here.  You look back in time, you know, when was TV first?  When did it come out to the public, the masses?  I would say the late 30s, early 40s.  1820?  1820.  I think Jimmy's right.  All right, 1820.  Thanks.  Good.  We got that right.  But now let's think about this.  How long did it take to show the first couple on TV even sharing the same bed?  Right.  Oh, my God.  That was Uncle Miltie on the Texaco Star Theater who was fucking, oh, really?  I wish I had another name. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Well, Sid Caesar.  Sid Caesar in the ass.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What was the first?  Who was the first couple to be in the same bed on TV?  In the same bed?  That used to be a trivia question.  I looked it up when I was on hold, and Snoop said it was like something and Johnny in 1946.  Something and Johnny.  Frankie and Johnny?  I think so.  Ed and Johnny?  It was a prelude to I Love Lucy.  Prelude?  Oh.  A prelude to I Love Lucy.  Here comes the pre.  No one heard of this show. 
[00:49:30]  I Love Lucy.  They didn't sleep in the same bed either, though.  Right.  Brady Bunch, though.  Well, I'm just saying, you look at the progression, how long it took for that to become normal.  Brady Bunch, they were in the same bed, but I doubt anything was going on there.  Absolutely not.  Holy cow.  Maybe when the missus was gone.  He had a bear trap set up in between them, so she couldn't actually roll over and put  her ugly hole on his leg.  He would hate when he'd wake up and get what he called a mid-leg kiss from her vaginal lips.  But just to the point, fellas, you look at the progression, how long it took for that 
[00:50:00]  to become acceptable.  Okay.  And we've gone from nothing to now full-on tongue raping on TV.  We kind of said that yesterday.  You're going to have to give the people some time.  You know, the PC people want everyone to progress aggressively forward now.  Right.  And some of these things are going to take time.  Period.  Unfortunately, it was a black as well.  Some people aren't going to want to see it at all. 
[00:50:30]  Of course.  Like, there are TV shows on that show gay men and gay relationships and gay storylines.  But you're not forced to watch them.  So unless you're watching them, you're not going to get used to seeing things like that.  So as a guy, you're always going to be taken aback when you see two men open mouth kissing  like that.  It's just a bit of a shocker.  Well, I mean, the times have changed, and people who are not comfortable with it, 
[00:51:00]  it's one of those things you're going to have to get used to.  Is it bitching or pitching?  Pitching effect.  We have finally figured that out.  Yeah, pitching effect's the expression.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  But yeah, people are going to have to get used to it.  It's going to be there.  My dick's full of shit.  Get over it.  I don't want to clit.  Get over.  But yeah, people are just going to have to adjust to it. 
[00:51:30]  Well, Stephen Smith, Stephen A. Smith on ESPN, finally threw some logic and some honesty  forward here.  I did hear this clip, I believe.  This is pretty brave, I think, because people get in trouble now for saying stuff like this,  especially on ESPN.  It's a guy's network.  You know, if you're gay, so be it.  I mean, I'm liberal in my thinking.  You know, I've always been an advocate for, you know, civil rights for the gay community.  I don't believe in hate crimes and, you know, verbal, physical, or otherwise. 
[00:52:00]  I definitely think, and I definitely am a proponent for them receiving their civil rights  and things of that nature.  But I've implored in the past for the gay community to understand and accept what I'm about to say  again.  Again, that doesn't mean that everybody's going to like you and like what you see.  And as a result of that, people should have the freedom to not want to be associated with 
[00:52:30]  that or not want that in their face.  Now, if people don't like that, then that's fine.  I don't have a problem with it, but I do respect those that do.  Did he take the same take on Donald Sterling?  Probably not.  Oh, probably not.  Probably.  Probably not.  Everyone has their own little agenda.  Oh, I see.  We're all hypocritical.  Probably not.  But, you know, it's a good take on that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty much what we were saying yesterday, too. 
[00:53:00]  But for some reason, it's not okay to express that you didn't like that or that it made you  uncomfortable.  It made you uncomfortable.  I mean, all these news programs.  Not one person stepped forward and said, that was a little uncomfortable.  They're all like, isn't that a great thing that happened?  Can you imagine that?  Just going, you know, that's great, but it was a little shocking when I first saw it.  You can't do that.  You can't be honest enough to say that and open up that discussion with the people on the  news that might want to get that message out there. 
[00:53:30]  And they're only showing it because it's shocking.  Right.  They're showing it because it's shocking and then acting surprised when someone is shocked.  When someone's shocked.  What a great gig it is to be in the press.  I know.  It's like you're playing tricks on people all the time.  It's complete insanity.  Yeah, yeah.  It's candid camera.  It's like you yell, hello, and when someone turns around, you're like, aha, we got you  to turn around.  Right.  It's just insane.  I don't know.  It really is just insane.  Let's say hi to Pez in Pennsylvania. 
[00:54:00]  Pez.  Hey.  I'm actually bisexual myself.  I've been with a few guys here and there.  Okay.  I still think it's absolutely disgusting just thinking about kissing another guy or seeing  other guys kiss.  That's just weird to me, and I don't get it.  What, do you get right to the old dick sucking?  Oh, yeah, I've had a dick in my mouth before, but I will not kiss another guy if this guy 
[00:54:30]  is.  There you go.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  You could have just potted the mic up, Travis.  You didn't have to call.  Jesus.  All right, Pez, thank you.  Oh, Triumph.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Boston.  Jeff.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Have you ever heard the Norm MacDonald's gay pride bit?  It's fantastic.  Is that the same one we always play?  Sure.  We played it a million times over the years.  It's fucking perfect. 
[00:55:00]  I just thought it was appropriate.  It's so good.  Can we play it right now?  Yeah, I love that one.  We're not going to break, though, but can we play it?  All right, yeah, play this really fast.  We haven't played this in a while.  One time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and they were all gay people in the audience,  they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it there  were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son. 
[00:55:30]  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, because it's not an achievement.  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid,  oh my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[00:56:00]  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh yeah, he loves cock.  This kid, he can't get enough cock in his mouth, his ass, this kid's always cock.  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock.  I want to show it to him.  He's going to be proud.  To watch the maturation of you as an artist, to realize it took you nine and a half minutes 
[00:56:30]  to get around to the second cock stuff.  It's beautiful to see you comfortable in your own skin, Normie.  All right.  Normie!  When he first got, he loves cock.  That's a great reveal.  You just don't know where it's going up till there.  Fucking Norm.  God damn.  It should just be whatever, man, right?  Yeah.  I guess we got to go through this so it becomes whatever. 
[00:57:00]  I don't understand it.  But that's just it, because you don't have to.  No one can force you to be accepting of a lifestyle, like the gay lifestyle.  No one can force you to be accepting.  You have to tolerate it, you know?  But no one can make you comfortable seeing it, want your children to see it.  You know, this is a very touchy issue, the gay thing.  It is the same arguments, or the same discomfort people had, I think, with interracial stuff.  Like, you know... 
[00:57:30]  Had?  But you know what I mean?  Especially, like, with Patch of Blue with Sidney Poitier and Shelley Winters and Sidney Poitier.  And the blind girl falls in love with the black guy and the mother doesn't like it.  Yeah, Selina.  Is that her name?  Your name is Selina.  Because she'd call herself Selina.  My name's Selina.  He's like, Selina?  Because, no, pronounce it right.  Your name is Selina.  It is a beautiful name.  And then she took that fucking big kick.  But that was a big shocking...  Mm-hmm.  You know. 
[00:58:00]  Selina.  Oh, yeah.  Just getting used to it.  Yeah, um...  Well, yeah, some people still do have a problem with that.  Oh, yeah, I don't want to see that on TV.  Kids are...  Same fucking excuses.  Fuck you.  Fuck your kids.  Put on something else.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They're calling it crazy.  Fiance's sister attacks Jay-Z.  Like Jay-Z, only crazy.  I'm surprised that they're showing this so much.  Shocked and disappointed that there was a clear breach of our security system.  That's what the standard hotel is saying.  Yeah, that's not good. 
[00:58:30]  Let's say hi to Jeremy, who's calling from France.  Ah.  Bonjour.  Bonjour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's like, yeah.  What time is it in France?  That's what I'm trying to say.  I'm in Rhode Island, but I'm from France.  Oh.  Okay, all right.  Eh, poofy eyes.  Salope.  You should have said you were calling from France.  We would have kept you on the line for a while.  Well, uh, that's your intern. 
[00:59:00]  I told them I wasn't from France.  Then why would you mention you were born in France?  No, I mean, I'm from France, but I live in Rhode Island.  Okay, but why would you mention that when you called in?  Yeah.  Because I think it's pertinent to the subject I want to discuss.  Okay.  Oh.  That's an excellent answer to your question, Jim Dorton.  I asked you a good answer.  Fair enough.  And by the way, Jimmy, a lot of Louis episodes were on last night.  You're looking good, man.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, I understand they showed the fat girl episode. 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  It was good.  All right, so anyway, I'm surprised you guys haven't talked about the winner of the  latest Eurovision Song Contest.  Oh, yeah, that's not a big thing here for some reason.  I know, but...  But the bearded woman?  Oh, is that that transsexual thing?  I don't know what that was.  Wait, what's going on?  What's going on?  She's a drag queen, but all the papers are calling him her and she.  I don't think he's the proper parlance.  Is that right, Jimmy? 
[01:00:00]  I don't know anymore.  It's really, who knows, you know, do you say he or her, I don't drag queens, it's different  than a transsexual.  Conchito worse?  What parts?  I don't know.  What parts does it have?  I don't know.  If it's got a dick, it's a dude.  Yeah.  Well, hold on a second now.  I may have to take issue with you.  I don't know, actually, what's the problem?  Yeah, I don't know.  He had a beard, too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a guy.  It's just kind of like the point you guys were making yesterday.  You look at it and you're like, whoa, you know, you can't help but have an honest reaction 
[01:00:30]  of total bewilderment and you're just like, ugh.  A guy just dressing like a woman, I think, is different than someone who thinks they're  a woman or feels like a woman.  Right.  It's just a different thing.  A drag queen is somebody, I think, doing an impression of a woman.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what this was, though.  This is some Euro shit that we don't really pay attention to here in the States.  Right.  We got enough of our own stupid contest show singing crap over here. 
[01:01:00]  I don't really understand what the problem is.  That it's that one.  Honestly, I think it's kind of like a freak show.  They're making a big topic.  Yeah, it's like a freak show.  Was the song good?  I couldn't even tell you.  See?  All right.  It's a yearly gay tradition, the Eurovision Song Contest.  Okay.  Oh, so it's a gay thing?  Yeah, it's a gay thing.  All right.  You see the picture of him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he was.  Walking over glass. 
[01:01:30]  Maybe save a trouble.  Well, the time has passed.  Hearing from the mirror.  No, that he's...  Shaved the fucking facial hair, maybe.  You know, had a little realism.  Yeah.  Who can this person...  Facial hair just kills it for me.  You wouldn't know me at all today.  I don't understand what beard is.  Yeah, I don't know why. 
[01:02:00]  Whoa.  Crazy digital fucking zoom.  It just looks like a man dressed as a woman.  Right.  With a beard.  Yeah, why is that so shocking?  It's just...  Eddie Izzard performs like that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Whatever.  All right, Jeremy, thank you.  This fucking shit off.  I ain't going anywhere.  I had it. 
[01:02:30]  All right, Frenchie.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  He's from France.  Thanks a lot.  He's not in France.  I just remember that.  It's not pertinent to the discussion.  No.  It wasn't at all.  The lies were exposed.  It's not a tad.  We should get into the Donald Sterling thing, but we're going to need a little time because  he's babbling again, and it leads to today's apology as we attempt to go 10 lousy days  without an apology.  This is great because he just, I guess he thinks he's helping his case by getting out 
[01:03:00]  there and showing how human he is, showing that he can explain what happened, and then  he just goes off on Magic Johnson in a way that's like, what are you thinking?  Doesn't it make lawyers seem smarter when they tell their clients to shut up?  It's like, you're like, wow, that's why lawyers say it.  Right.  I guess, and we all would like to think we're smart enough to get out there and handle it,  but maybe, you know, maybe we're all not. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe we would get tripped up and look stupid or say something stupid.  Well, I mean, this is a lawyer's worst nightmare is him going out there.  It reminds me of the Sandusky.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it's Can't Jerk Off, right?  Do you?  What was the question?  Are you attracted to young children?  And he was like, hmm.  Yeah.  He had to think it over.  You never pause.  The no should have come out before the question was over.  It should have been part of the question.  Right.  You get that no before the question mark. 
[01:04:00]  Before the question mark.  You don't even wait for the question mark.  You do a lady die on that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, that's, uh, but he was like, hmm, attracted to young children.  What really does attracted mean?  Then his wife just saying, dementia.  He's got dementia.  Yeah, yeah, that's dementia.  Right.  Come on.  That's it.  Start shuffling around in a robe, you dummy.  We'll get into the Donald Sterling thing after the break for sure. 
[01:04:30]  Stay there.  That's exactly what happened.  It's time of the conversation with Sam.  Sam being a fanboy.  Yeah.  He, uh, brought up out of nowhere a show we did back in 2004 where I was very angry at  milk.  Yeah.  And you said the show was, uh, a lot different back then.  You said I was a lot angrier.  Oh, you were so, you were so much angrier.  Like, you forget.  But, like, back in 2004, like, you were furious. 
[01:05:00]  Like, you were, I mean, E-Rock was taking it way worse than he takes it now.  And, and you were just fucking, you were screaming at everybody because you didn't have milk.  Milk?  It was just milk.  You were like.  Can you find that?  Yeah.  And then Ant was like, dude, you're a fucking maniac right now.  And you were like, I understand I'm a maniac, but I need fucking milk.  Could someone cut that up for us in the back?  Yeah.  And so we could play it properly.  But I just explained to you. 
[01:05:30]  I was so angry back then because we were on, we were on top of the radio world and we get  fired.  And then we go away for almost two and a half years.  It's in between two and two and a half.  It's like two years, three months if you need to be technical.  Yeah.  And we didn't have Twitter, Facebook, none of that shit.  When you went away back then, you were gone.  Gone from the fans.  And we weren't allowed to pop up anywhere.  They were trying to bury us.  And then we finally get back after two years, three months.  And my anger stemmed from the fact that we were still not talking to anybody. 
[01:06:00]  No.  The frustration.  And I think we talked about it in the Unmasked, you would drive around New York City looking  for those satellite radio antennas.  Antennas on cars so you could be like, oh.  And me and Aunt would try to spin it positively.  I would, you know, come into work and go, I saw, I was in rush hour traffic coming into  the Lincoln Tunnel and I was counting all the ones coming out of the tunnel that had the  satellite antenna. 
[01:06:30]  And I swear it was like 20.  I was trying to spin that.  I saw 20 cars during rush hour that had these antennas.  Now you can't tell which cars have satellite.  But back then it was very obvious.  It was those big, thick ones.  And that's where my frustration and all my anger came from.  I'm like, fuck, we're going to have to, we already sat the two years, three months.  We're going to have to, we're going to have to at least do it another year or two before  anybody starts hearing us.  It was a slow build.  And no offense to the hardcores because those are the guys that kept us, uh, were 
[01:07:00]  kept myself sane because they did go out and get it.  But I'm talking about, you know, actually talking to a, you know, an impressive audience.  To this day, we don't, I don't, I don't even know who we're talking to.  No one knows numbers.  I don't know.  Sometimes I think it's just a tiny audience.  And then there's social media stuff like emails I get.  Yeah, I think there's a lot.  And things like that.  And it's like, fuck, there's really, there are a lot of people.  I think we're doing all right.  Yeah.  We have, I just don't know what the number is.  I have no idea.  I've heard around a mill. 
[01:07:30]  I don't know if that's true.  I'm not going to sit here and say that's true.  Per hour?  And we're not going to, and we're not going to pump up the numbers like other people around  here.  I don't know.  I just don't know.  No one knows.  There's not a show on this platform that knows how many people they're talking to.  No.  I don't know why they keep that from you.  I don't know.  It's, um, they have to be able to tell.  They know.  They know for, they know a ballpark figure or, you know, how many listeners per channel.  Yeah.  I'm sure they research it.  But for some reason, they don't want the talent to know that.  I don't.  Wouldn't they want to know what channels they have to scrap or, you know, they need some 
[01:08:00]  bandwidth.  I think that's what they end up doing, right?  It's like, oh, this channel doesn't have a lot of listeners.  Well, how do you know that?  Well, we have ways of finding out.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Tell them.  What are our numbers?  Yeah.  Well, we can tell you that.  Right.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Uh, we're not playing a 17 minute bit.  Yeah.  What do you think of it?  It's Friday?  I mean, we're, E-Rock's cutting clips from this right now.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  See?  Sorry.  Sorry. 
[01:08:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  How about this?  Hurry up, E-Rock.  The boss is waiting.  There you go.  Coddling E-Rock.  He gets coddled around here.  There's nothing but bungle.  The clip will prove that I'm much calmer these days.  Oh, yeah.  I do have my episodes, but I'm much calmer.  Uh, Donald Sterling is still talking to, uh, Anderson Cooper.  When is their interview going to be over?  Soon?  Are they still talking?  Um, I don't know.  They've been talking for about a day and a half straight, I think.  Well, it was pre-taped. 
[01:09:00]  That's the new thing with these interviews, though.  If you got one of these exclusive interviews, you only do, you only do, like, five minutes  a day.  Right.  So we got, this is all the new stuff that came out yesterday, right?  Isn't it amazing?  This is the news.  This guy is a racist, and they're milking what he says to get ratings.  Of course.  Let's milk what the racist said.  Because this is truly news, so you should, you should get it out there immediately. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  But they're holding it back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They never held back info.  No.  You had to get it out there immediately.  Eking it out slowly just to get those out.  And in CNN, no one watches CNN.  They say, like, times 250,000, like, prime time.  It's horrendous.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Terrible.  That's unbelievable.  Are they still looking for the plane?  What about the plane?  Something about the plane?  What about the girls?  What about the girls?  What about the Nigerian girls?  Everyone's holding up their signs.  We should have had the girls back by now.  And now people are getting flack for saying those signs don't do anything. 
[01:10:00]  They don't.  They're just fucking...  They're showing support, I guess, but they're not, they're not, they're not paying attention  to the fact that, you know, Justin Bieber held up a sign.  Or Ellen DeGeneres held up a sign.  You don't think the Muslim radicals who kidnapped the girls and are threatening to sell them into  slavery are looking at hashtags?  And, uh-oh, now we're in trouble. 
[01:10:30]  What happened to Coney?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Brooklyn, a regular.  Tommy, day one listener on satellite.  What's up?  Good morning, guys.  You know what's frustrating is once in a while they send out surveys, XM, Sirius, and you've  got to search to find your name on it.  I mean, they have, you know, you're under a category instead of a title.  Yeah, it should just be us.  I think...  Well, we have no... 
[01:11:00]  I think we're under talk programming, so if you click on that, then they give you the  choices, I believe, right?  And adult listening, and guy talk, and stuff like that.  Yet you have Howard right out there.  Hey, his agent was smart.  His agent put that in and made them do that.  I believe the company's probably not...  Our agent is not doing that shit.  And he should be doing it.  But the company itself isn't doing anything to help you.  No, they never will.  They can't even be in a fucking chair.  At this point, my expectations are very low. 
[01:11:30]  I just want to...  I want a fucking chair.  Is that okay?  I think that was a strategy of theirs.  I gave up on the fucking studio.  But how about a chair?  Can we start there?  Thank you, Tommy.  All right.  All right.  Let's get into Donald Sterling talking to Anderson Cooper.  Here's all the new stuff, as they just leak parts of the interview every day.  And not helping himself with these statements.  Oh, this is some great audio.  I made a terrible, terrible mistake. 
[01:12:00]  And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people...  We played this clip already, right?  We played part of it.  They leaked a little bit of it, and this is the long form of it.  Oh, the long version of it.  That's why the news is doing it.  Okay.  All right.  All that I've heard.  And I've hurt so many people.  So many innocent people.  And I've hurt myself.  You know?  Selfish.  I spoke to a girl that I was fond of. 
[01:12:30]  And I don't know why I could never...  When I listened to that tape, I don't even know how I could say words like that.  I'm not a racist.  I love people.  I always have.  I'm whining.  But those words came out of my mouth, I guess.  And I'm so sorry.  I'm so apologetic.  What are you sorry about?  Well, I'm sorry that so many people are hurt.  My little grandchild goes to a Catholic nursery. 
[01:13:00]  They were passing around candy to everybody.  When they got to her, they said, we don't give candy to racists.  That never happened.  That never happened.  I'm sure it hurts me.  Maybe one of the kids might have said it.  One of those shitty kids.  They were passing around candy and give it to racists. 
[01:13:30]  Who said that?  I heard...  The teacher?  Who said that?  Did the teacher say that?  Anyway, and I'm so apologetic.  Oh, is he the fucking worst?  Oh, he just...  There's no sympathy.  You can't conjure up any sympathy for this guy.  No.  He's just trying to save his ass, so he's pulling out all the stops.  But he's not a sympathetic guy.  You can't look at him and listen to what he's saying and go, 
[01:14:00]  oh, right, he's an old curmudgeon, racist, this, that, the other thing.  Right.  But...  And then you say, but, and then there's some kind of redeeming quality.  But, you know, he just sounds so sad or this or that.  There's nothing there that makes me, like, have any sympathy for this guy.  Did you know you were being recorded?  No, of course not.  Of course not.  No.  See, that goes against what she has said.  That he's forgetful, so, you know, he has told her to record all conversations since... 
[01:14:30]  This is where I believe him.  This part, I believe.  Do you know when it was recorded?  Were you together in a room with Vista Viana?  Yes.  Well, I remember some of the dialogue in a living room.  Sounds like old Bill.  Yeah, he's just, they kicked me in the guts.  Oh, chicken.  Oh, boy.  Bill's joy likes chicken.  I don't know when...  So it was just you and her in the room? 
[01:15:00]  And just the two of us, yes.  So you didn't know she was recording or there was a recording device?  No, I didn't know she was recording and she was talking so strange all of a sudden about politics.  But I want to explain a couple of things that I said.  One of the things that I said was, don't bring blacks to my game.  Well, there's 25% of my whole game are black people and I love them.  And she would always use the word black. 
[01:15:30]  That's a black girl.  That's a black guy.  This is black.  That's black.  So when she said to me, I'm going to bring four gorgeous black guys to the game.  Players she was referring to, either football or...  I was a little jealous, maybe.  When did she say that?  Just before.  And I said to her, don't bring them to the game.  Because of my jealousy.  I mean, in any event, she never brought anybody to the game. 
[01:16:00]  It was like she was baiting me just to say things.  It's bullshit because when she said, take all the blacks off my Instagram, he's like,  oh, we...  He's like, well, you didn't do it.  Right.  Yeah, he's full of shit.  He's trying, but he's not answering certain things.  There's probably some jealousy involved, though, right?  Yeah.  But I think it's more his friends.  Because if he's jealous, why would he say, bring him here and have sex with him?  Feed him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why would he say, admire them in private?  He's just worried about what his friends say?  Yeah.  I don't know why the girl had me say those things. 
[01:16:30]  Had me say those things.  You're saying you were set up.  Well, yes, I was baited.  I mean, it's not the way I talk.  I don't talk about people, for one thing, ever.  I talk about ideas and other things, but I don't talk about people.  No.  Do you know how the tape got released?  No.  Do you think she did it?  It's...  I don't know.  I mean, an 80-year-old man is kind of foolish, and I'm kind of foolish.  I thought she liked me and really cared for me. 
[01:17:00]  I guess being 50 years, 51 years older than her, I was deluding myself.  Were you in a relationship with her?  An intimate relationship?  Well, I don't know what you mean by intimate.  She says you weren't.  She told Barbara Walters that you weren't.  Well...  That she's your protector.  She's your right hand.  I don't think a gentleman should discuss, you know, any of the personal items that go  on with a woman, and I don't want to answer that particular question. 
[01:17:30]  Do you trust her now?  No, I don't trust her, and I just wish I could ask her.  Why?  I think because he's still married, technically, right?  It's obviously a yes.  You know, if it's no, you say no.  Right.  Right.  But I guess he's officially still married, and that could, you know, mess up a divorce case  or something, he obviously was trying to get it in.  Yeah, he probably wanted some of that, right?  He had to do something with her.  Boy, yeah.  And I just wish I could ask her why, and if she was just setting me up, I think that people 
[01:18:00]  say she was taping me for two years.  So, maybe I was just fooling myself, thinking for two years that she cared for me.  She certainly acted like it.  Her lawyer had made a statement that she was your archivist.  What does that mean?  That...  I mean, too young for archives.  You don't want to have your story written just yet?  No.  What does that mean? 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  This ain't working.  This ain't working.  No.  No.  Magic Johnson had said that, you know, he wouldn't...  Yeah, so here's the Magic Johnson stuff.  This is what everyone's focusing on today.  Oh, yeah.  That other stuff is more of a recap, I guess.  It's whoops-a-daisy.  He has it out for Magic Johnson, for whatever reason.  Magic Johnson had said that, you know, he would never attend a game while you were owner. 
[01:19:00]  Apparently, he showed up to a game today.  He would never what?  Attend a Clippers game as long as you were owner.  And he came today to see the game.  He's there at the game.  Yeah.  I don't think it's worthy of you discussing.  Such a stupid remark.  But he lulled me into waiting a week.  Do you know what I mean?  Don't do anything.  He told you...  You're saying he told you not to say anything?  Yeah, don't do anything. 
[01:19:30]  I know the girl.  Don't do anything.  I'll help you.  I'm waiting and I'm waiting and I'm waiting.  What you're saying is Magic Johnson called you up or you called him up?  I don't know his phone number.  He called you up when the tape broke.  I don't call anybody.  He called you up.  I'm loyal to you.  He called you up when the tape came out and he told you not to say anything?  Yeah.  Why did he say don't say anything?  He just said, wait.  Be patient.  I'll help you.  We'll work it out.  What's this connection with Magic Johnson?  What the hell is going on, man? 
[01:20:00]  Magic probably wants something.  I mean, Magic...  Maybe he's panicking because Donald Sterling knows a little more.  Maybe Magic Johnson...  I'm just saying maybe.  Maybe he's got something going on with his broad, too.  Maybe.  There's something going on with Magic Johnson that hasn't come out yet with this.  Oh, yeah.  And then Donald Sterling continues.  Why do you think he said that?  I think he wanted me to just do nothing so he could buy the team. 
[01:20:30]  He thought maybe the whole thing would be resolved in two weeks.  What has he done?  Can you tell me?  Oh, boy.  Big Magic Johnson.  What has he done?  Well, he's a business person.  He's got AIDS.  Did he do anything?  I love it.  He's a business person.  You got AIDS?  Oh, did he fucking blurt that out?  This not helping?  Do you think this is helping? 
[01:21:00]  I just wanted a picture of the lawyer in the background going, oh, God, shut up.  It got AIDS.  Oh, my God.  What did that have to do with...  Oh, he's going to continue.  This guy's done.  What has he done?  Well, he's a business person.  He's got AIDS.  You don't just blurt that out of context like that.  He just resents Magic Johnson. 
[01:21:30]  Big Magic Johnson.  Big Magic Johnson.  You tell me.  Big Magic Johnson.  What has he done?  Well, he's a business person.  He's got AIDS.  Did he do any business?  Did he help anybody in South L.A.?  Well, I think he has HIV.  He doesn't actually have full-blown AIDS.  Well, what kind of a guy goes to every city, has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV?  Is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about? 
[01:22:00]  I think he should be ashamed of himself.  I think he should go into the background.  But what does he do for the black people?  He doesn't do anything.  You call up and say, well, you know the Jewish people have...  He's opened a lot of businesses in inner-city neighborhoods.  The Jewish people have a company, and it's for people who want to borrow money and no interest.  They want to give them a fishing pole.  We want to help people.  If they don't have the money, we'll loan it to you.  You don't have interest, one day you'll pay us back. 
[01:22:30]  I'm just telling you, he does nothing.  It's all talk.  So are you saying that African-Americans don't contribute to African-American communities as much as Jewish people?  There's no African-American...  Never mind.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  I didn't...  Wow.  I'm sorry.  Oh, what was he ready to blurt out?  There's no African-American who's got as much of his community as a Jew has for his.  That's what I'm guessing.  Yeah, something like that.  That's the end of it? 
[01:23:00]  Yep.  Did Anderson Cooper let him go?  Yeah.  Well, unless they leak more of the interview today.  That is fantastic.  That's pretty much what you get to that.  Oh, boy.  I would love to hear that last thing.  He's got eight.  Wow.  What a dummy.  You see why they want him gone, though.  He was a hateable guy, but...  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they got a new guy running the team.  Yeah.  They picked a black guy.  Of course, they got to do that.  Right.  I don't even know his name.  I saw him having a press conference or something yesterday.  Yeah.  The TV was on mute. 
[01:23:30]  And I just looked over and said, new temporary owner or whatever, the Clippers.  But it's like in the African-American community, and it almost sounded like I wanted to say  there is no African-American community, like something like that also.  But, yeah, I think your idea of the African-Americans haven't done anything near what the Jews have  done to support their own people, like he might have been going there.  Can we hear the end of that again, like the last 10 seconds?  Yeah, on here.  It sounds like he's gearing up, because he said there's never been an African-American. 
[01:24:00]  Ah, forget it.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he was going to say there's never been an African-American who's done more for  their community than I have.  Why do you think he said that?  Okay, let me be right.  Maybe.  Right.  You're probably right, actually.  She's right.  And then I love the...  ...to African-American communities as much as Jewish people...  There's no African-American...  Never mind.  Nothing better than a doddering 80-year-old who's a racist trying to defend himself that 
[01:24:30]  he's not a racist.  He can't even...  He's going to trip up.  Yeah, he can't even...  Fucking...  He can't even fake it.  Let's say hi to Brandon in South Carolina.  Brandon.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, so I wanted to go back to the part where he said, you know, I was baited.  He's apologizing for saying that he was baited when in reality he's just...  You know, if he kept quiet, you know, nothing will come out that he's a racist.  He's just apologizing for the fact that he's baited by the... 
[01:25:00]  I forget what the girl's name is, but he's apologizing for being baited.  V.  V, right.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think he just needs to keep his mouth shut just because, you know, even in the interview,  if he keeps talking, the more he talks, the more he sounds like a racist.  He just needs to, you know, put somewhere and just keep his mouth shut.  Magic Johnson's too close to the situation.  My suspicions are popping up with Magic Johnson and this broad. 
[01:25:30]  Maybe they had something going on as well.  Maybe, maybe, maybe she just kind of gets around in that world, if you know what I mean.  You know what I mean?  Can I see more pictures of V?  But something, something, something's not being said as far as she and Magic Johnson go.  Yeah.  Why would he resent Magic Johnson, who really is a...  Maybe because, you know, he's jealous of Magic Johnson and her relationship with him.  What kind of man has sex with a bunch of women and catches AIDS? 
[01:26:00]  He's, I don't know, what kind of 80-year-old has sex with a girl of mixed race when he's  obviously not fond of one of those races while he's still technically...  I mean, you could, you know...  Yeah.  I agree with Mike in Florida, by the way.  I thought he was going to say that as well.  Why can't you just be an American?  I think that's the angle he was taking on that.  There are no African-Americans.  And then he was going to say, you know, we're all just Americans or something like that.  We'll never know what he was going to say.  Well, unless they save that part for tonight's. 
[01:26:30]  Well, no.  Tonight's CNN exclusive.  Because he went, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah, but wouldn't Cooper just keep on him on that?  You'd think.  Because he knows he's got gold if he just continues with that.  All right.  Well, that leads to today's apology.  Yay.  So, once again, we reset the apology clock.  Trying to go ten days without an apology on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ten days ain't ever going to happen.  Adam Silver.  He's the new NBA commissioner. 
[01:27:00]  The ball guy that you've seen on TV.  Nosferatu.  Yeah.  He has apologized to Magic Johnson for malicious Sterling statements.  Why?  Why?  They've already told him he can't go to any games.  He's now just an exiled owner of the team.  What responsibility is it of Silver to apologize for this guy?  Magic Johnson isn't really part of the NBA right now.  Yeah.  It's one of the NBA greats, but I don't think. 
[01:27:30]  Is he part of the NBA officially?  This apology makes no sense.  He's not playing.  He's, I don't know.  NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement in response to Donald Sterling's CNN interview with Anderson Cooper earlier this evening.  Official release.  I just read a transcript of Donald Sterling's interview with Anderson Cooper.  And while Magic Johnson doesn't need me to, I feel compelled on behalf of the NBA family to apologize to him that he continues to be dragged into this situation and be degraded by such a malicious and personal attack. 
[01:28:00]  The NBA board of governors is continuing with its process to remove Mr. Sterling as soon as possible.  Enough groveling by Adam Silver.  We know how you feel.  You didn't say it.  You did what you had to do or you felt you had to do.  So shut the fuck up about Sterling, what he says.  This is going to be a Magic Johnson bombshell.  He's being dragged into this a little too much. 
[01:28:30]  What is being missed here?  I'm telling you, my suspicion is pretty high right now.  His sexuality, which I think a lot of people have.  I don't carry the way.  Donald Sterling helped him in that regard.  Now the whole country thinks he got the HIV from a woman.  There's been rumors the other way.  We can say that, right?  Of course.  The apology continues.  Well, what kind of a guy goes to every...  Oh, okay.  That was the quote. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  All right.  The quote that Adam Silver is apologizing for on behalf of Magic Johnson.  All right.  Let's say hi to Troy in Houston.  Troy.  Hey, guys.  It's Trey, but no big deal.  Hey, Trey.  First time caller.  I love you guys.  Jim Norton.  You're fucking the terrible, by the way.  Thank you.  I just wanted to say, remember Tommy Lasorda went on a radio or something last week and  said, I hope she gets hit by a car?  Best interview ever. 
[01:29:30]  She was in a car wreck yesterday.  It's on TMZ.  If you go look it up.  It was a little fender bender, but they did say Tommy Lasorda got his wish.  Hit with a car, he said.  Yeah.  Hit with a car.  No, Tommy Lasorda wanted her to be crossing the street and get hit by a car.  She was in a tiny little fender bender.  I think she just kind of rolled into somebody.  Yeah.  She hit a Range Rover or some shit, and then she gets pissed off at the guy and says, you  know who you're messing with, mother?  And then they bleep it out.  Is there a video of that? 
[01:30:00]  I got to see that.  Oh, the chick.  She's a twat.  Yes.  Yeah.  She deserves everything that she gets.  But Donald Sterling's also a retard, so he kind of deserves everything.  For the most part, she's being left alone, but she's a twat.  She's secretly taping people, and I do agree with Sterling to a point about being baited.  She obviously had some kind of agenda that day, for whatever reason.  Two years she taped him.  Two years.  If that's true.  Waiting for the bombshell.  Yeah, she's been proven a gold ticker. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  And I don't know.  What's up with her and Magic Johnson, officially?  What's going on there?  I don't know.  Or maybe there's some kind of cuckold situation going on.  Oh.  I don't know.  Maybe Donald Sterling is serving the bull.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, it needs to be prepped.  It's not going to prep itself.  Good morning.  All right, Troy.  Thank you.  Take care.  Good evening.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  People want to know if you're getting paid to write these speeches for Sterling, Anthony.  Oh, yes, yes.  I'm the speech writing crew.  That was not a good one.  Not.  You don't think it was a success?  No.  Yeah, blacks.  Meh.  Sterling hates Magic because he's part of a group trying to buy the Clippers.  Okay, so that could be it right there.  As simple as that.  That's why.  No word for magic about these latest statements? 
[01:31:30]  Yes, AIDS!  I think Anderson Cooper's going to be talking to him tonight, I believe.  I think that goes down today.  Or tonight.  Runs businesses?  AIDS!  Get AIDS!  Oh, my God.  What good did he think that would be?  Just some fucking blurting AIDS out.  Get AIDS!  But can we break it down?  Yeah.  Because we try to hit some different angles here.  You think 80-year-olds can understand or accept AIDS? 
[01:32:00]  No.  So he's thinking everyone thinks like him, so he says AIDS, and everyone goes, yeah, AIDS.  This guy's right.  He does have AIDS.  You say Magic Shoes went into the background and crawled into the background.  Yeah, and died.  And meanwhile, the example he gives is that people with HIV or whatever can have a full  life if you take care of yourself, and it's not a death sentence necessarily.  AIDS!  AIDS!  But do 80-year-olds understand that?  No.  No.  No.  Across the board?  No.  I think the majority would think, wow. 
[01:32:30]  AIDS.  AIDS!  AIDS!  He's got AIDS!  He's got AIDS!  He's got AIDS, too.  Right.  Like the most obvious.  Like he was waiting just to throw this punch on TV.  And he just jumped in the middle of fucking, you know, Anderson was just talking about what  he's done.  You know, well, what has Magic Johnson done?  Oh, big Magic Johnson.  Well, all right, he's run a lot of businesses.  AIDS!  I'm like, why?  He's a good...  He's got AIDS!  In the end, Magic Johnson just saw some good opportunities in these neighborhoods to 
[01:33:00]  start businesses, right?  Yeah, he's smart.  You know, black people like movies.  Magic Johnson goes, let's do movie theaters.  You want to, you know, take that chance.  That's, you know, there's a risk there, but he was able to make it work.  I don't know.  Somewhat.  I don't know.  I think his theater's kind of failing, right?  Are they?  Are they really?  That's what I heard last, but that was a while ago.  Are movie theaters in general starting to fail?  Maybe.  You really got to step up your game.  Well, I mean, if it's one of those over-the-top movies, we're all going to go. 
[01:33:30]  IMAX, 3D, stadium seating thing, you know.  Godzilla.  But those average movies, why would you go anymore?  You got so many other, you know, entertainment choices.  On Demand's the way to go.  I want to see Godzilla.  They should just do that already.  Are the movie theaters holding them hostage?  I don't even care if the movie is brand new or not.  But those middle-of-the-road movies, so many more people would see if it was available on their TV immediately.  Well, don't forget, they get ticket sales.  You'd have two or three people watching, so you'd lose money in sales because you could have whoever you wanted over to watch it. 
[01:34:00]  Whereas if you watch it in the theater, it's one person and one ticket.  But even if I didn't have money, I would pay a lot more money to see these movies at home.  It would be great.  I think it equals that because there's going to be a lot of one person and two person paying, you know, if you want to pay 20 bucks for a movie.  Right, right.  And you're alone.  But you still want to see these movies alone.  I mean, are you going to, like, invite people over here and there for a movie?  Yeah, of course. 
[01:34:30]  But in general, you're just hanging around.  And here's one of those middle-of-the-road movies.  You're like, I'm not going to go to the theater to see this.  But wait, I could just see it now on my TV?  You're going to hit that button more often.  Definitely.  I think it would even out in the end.  I really do.  I watch a lot of on-demand movies.  I get excited when it says, you know, in theaters or whatever.  Those movies where...  Where you're like, oh, wow, this is in theaters, but I can see it now?  Yeah.  I've been tricked.  And then you realize why they do that.  You're like, oh, okay, this movie really stinks. 
[01:35:00]  Because it's a stinker.  Let's see.  A lot of calls, but nothing really to go to, I don't think.  Sterling has had to watch Magic and the Lakers succeed for years, and he's jealous.  I might be part of it.  Maybe he's sick of it.  Big Magic continates.  Yeah.  What's he done besides win world titles of AIDS?  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  All right.  Well, that's the latest on that.  And...  What's the apology? 
[01:35:30]  And we got an apology.  What will it be tomorrow?  I don't know.  I mean, there might be one...  What about Adrian Broner, or Boner, or Broner, right?  Broner.  The fighter?  Yeah.  Yeah, I haven't heard anything.  He's suspended until he apologizes.  He hasn't apologized yet.  No.  What's the latest on that?  Do we even know?  Huh.  Okay.  Oh, look!  They did it again.  Crazy.  Beyonce's sister attacks Jay-Z, and they're spelling crazy, cray-zy. 
[01:36:00]  The other big clip of the day is that fucking house exploding.  Wow.  See that thing come apart?  What was that about?  I don't know.  There was a fire in a house after...  There was a police...  Domestic dispute, right?  Yeah, domestic dispute.  Cop came in, got shot, and then the house starts on fire, because somebody got a little  rambunctious inside.  And then while they're doing the report, they're like, well, there was fire on the house, and  boom!  He got shot and killed?  Fuck it.  I don't know if he got killed.  But that fucking house just comes apart. 
[01:36:30]  Fucking part of the roof blows out the walls.  They got a great clip of it.  It looked like an action movie.  They really got a great clip of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one of those.  Think it'll go viral?  Yeah, I think...  You gotta blow your house up?  Is that...  I think a few eyes will see that one.  Yeah.  On a new ham shirt.  That was a...  New ham shirt.  Explodes on live TV.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Hey, what's up with the computer?  I've never had that issue before.  Is it freezing up on you? 
[01:37:00]  Why do we have any guys that look after this channel?  Seriously.  Oh, boy.  Why?  Why have any guys?  We could use that money better.  I, uh...  Have they fixed the computer?  Made it better for you, Sam Roberts?  Yes, it's better than when we complained about it.  But it's still a shitty computer?  I mean, I wouldn't...  Please say shitty or that rant I just did doesn't make any sense.  Shitty.  It's not a top-of-the-line computer.  You're still not giving the boss what he needs.  Look, the computer I'm using here is a shitty computer.  That's better.  Thank you. 
[01:37:30]  Way to attack the other bosses.  Which proves my point that I just said.  Thank God.  Yeah.  I hate being...  Uh...  Colin!  Hello.  Colin.  Hello.  Yeah.  What I find funny about the whole thing yesterday, and I said it earlier, is the fact that here's  a guy, meaning you, that hangs out with Seinfeld on a regular basis.  You're in...  Your career is taking off.  You're going to be in an Amy Schumer's movie with Judd Apatow, and you've certainly done  other things that are doing very well. 
[01:38:00]  And you loved just hanging on the phone with Lady Di yesterday just as much.  Well, because she brought up some good...  First of all...  Good points.  She brought up a good point about what to wear, and I was like, you know, I was thinking  about it all night, and I was like, ultimately, it's about the people.  You know?  It doesn't matter what you wear.  It's a gown event, and she needs to wear a gown.  We're not going to put up with our shenanigans.  We're going to officially have a red carpet where they all have to do their step and repeat,  right?  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Okay, good.  But the most scary part yesterday, which all the listeners heard, was it turned into  a situation where I was magic, she was beastiviano.  And Bill was sterling, because me and Lady Di were talking, and they left the phone  on.  Yeah.  And did you guys hear the end?  Oh, yeah.  We played earlier today.  I'm just thinking how I really wish you were magic.  Right.  Bill was coming off as very abusive.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:39:00]  No, Bill's sick of it.  Get off the phone.  God's eye.  And then she's shooing squirrels away as she's drinking a natty ice.  Yeah, you heard her pop the top of a can and start swallowing.  That would have been a great ending to a sad movie.  Yeah.  Just some broad in the yard with a natty ice, like, shooing the squirrel away, because all  she wants is her goddamn beer.  Yeah, it was like a Russian play.  Yes.  Yes.  It's a new American Gothic. 
[01:39:30]  You can have a Rockwell over there.  Just painting her with shooing squirrels with books in the background.  Yeah.  Picture Bill as, like, an aged, like, you know, street car named Desire Brando.  Yep.  I'm going to make believe I have jury duty.  I've got to be in that jury, the pool.  The jury pool where everyone just hangs out.  I have to be there.  She's going to drive everyone nuts before she's even called for anything.  She won't show up.  She's not going to show up to that.  That would be true, yeah.  Warrant out for arrest.  You should just lie.  I was always sick.  I don't know what happened. 
[01:40:00]  If we pay her, she'll show up.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, it's hard to get somebody in there.  You can't get somebody in there to tape.  It's a federal crime.  Oh, she would just be the worst juror.  Is there a federal crime to tape in there?  Even in the pool?  Well, I'm saying if E-Rock came in, for example.  You know what?  Put them down and give it a try.  We'll see.  I don't know.  Everyone got their cell phones.  I'm talking about when you're hanging out just waiting and waiting and waiting.  She's going to not stop babbling.  You think she'll babble to him?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, she's going to be the greatest juror ever.  That's a movie right there.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Lady Di.  In the jury.  She's going through DTs.  Right.  Why are there bugs crawling on me?  There's no bugs on you.  Yes, there are.  Yeah, the lawyer.  Innocent, he'll be guilty if he's guilty.  Yeah, she would screw the whole thing up.  But the lawyer tried to make his dramatic closing statement, and you know she's going to be there like,  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, just yapping.  Right, right.  She's waving hi to the fucking defendant.  Right.  Hi, hi.  How are you? 
[01:41:00]  It's me, Lady Di.  Do you know who I am?  Mistrial.  Right.  Fuck.  We've got to start over.  But I was just saying hi.  She doesn't understand the protocol.  Hi, judge.  Oh.  No, that's the judge.  No, no, no.  That's the judge.  I'm on the jury now, so I...  Shut up.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Would she fuck that whole thing up?  A jury of their peers.  They'd have to be trying a drunk rhinoceros for her to be a peer.  Wouldn't you make her the foreman? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  Madam Foreman, do you have a verdict?  Yeah, you know, we were hanging out back, and my friend Marion...  I was talking about the case to Marion.  Twelve suicidal men.  Do you have the verdict?  Yeah, yeah.  One minute, one minute, one minute.  One minute, one minute.  I went...  Are you really the judge?  Right.  Eleven angry men and one dumb manatee.  And one dunce. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, it's...  Yeah.  Why is Marion not coming to the thing?  Who knows?  I don't know, because she's too busy being a tough guy somewhere.  Muscling people around.  Yeah.  With a tough guy attitude.  Yeah, she's...  You're a tough guy.  Right.  She's trying to get a job with Mr. Gazzo on the docks.  Get the word out.  We've got to talk to Marion.  We've got to find out why she's not going to be part of the next Super Show.  I've got to go break some legs.  I'll sweat you.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  I'll sweat you.  Whoa, you could see a body fly out of the house in that video.  No way.  Supposedly the guy did die, or a cop.  Oh, yeah.  Man.  You saw the house explosion there, Colin?  That's pretty wild.  Wow.  A little video.  Yeah.  Crazy wild stuff.  How's your day going, Colin?  I don't know.  I just started, but it should be a good one.  Yeah, all right.  Life of a comic.  When are you coming back in here?  I mean, we miss you.  I mean, hopefully I'm going to come in maybe Friday.  You know, Sam was saying maybe the Super Show is going to be pushed until Friday, because 
[01:43:00]  this Friday?  Next week.  I mean...  Well, next week is bad.  I can do the weekend.  We don't need...  We can't do that.  We're not here.  Yeah, next week we've got half a week or something.  That's a blessing for all of us, because I'm not here either.  Blessing in disguise.  Wait, so what do you sneeze?  Friday might be the Super Show.  We might just throw it all together.  Yeah, if Colin can only make it in on Friday, I'm going to throw it together for Friday.  I can make it the weekend, but yeah, spontaneous Super Show, because sometimes they're a good  one, too.  That could be great.  Could you see at the end of the trial, like, they've just done their closing statements, 
[01:43:30]  Lady Di stands up and goes, no, wait, which one was supposedly the guy that did something?  Like, not even understanding who the defendant is.  He's that out of touch with what's going on.  Now, who is it?  What did he do?  Is she a disaster?  What's that?  Oh, Iraq's got a...  No, there's the milk thing.  No, I'm talking about the Star Wars Simpsons shirt.  Oh, he likes Simpsons. 
[01:44:00]  Awesome.  He's like, awesome, right?  He likes the Simpsons.  He loves a good pop culture mashup.  Doesn't he?  When your wife sees you walk out of the house with that, does she think of hiring someone  to kill you?  She's probably looking for fucking...  She's on soldieroffortune.com.  I'm looking for assassins.  You have the packages show up.  Oh, you have another package.  Where is it?  It's laying on the floor by the front door.  She doesn't even bring it in.  No, she's...  Why would she?  Childish toys.  Carbage.  Another thing from Mattel.  She's hoping it's from Ted Kaczynski. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, this nice wooden box.  Yeah.  He molded them very nice from what I hear.  He did.  Old Teddy K.  A lot of nice work went into those bombs.  Not lazy.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, guys.  I'll see you later.  Bye, Kyle.  Thanks, Kyle.  See you Friday.  Bye, Joe.  I have an update, too.  You do?  Yeah, just a brief one.  All right.  That Whip Him Out Wednesday is still on the 92.3 site.  Wow.  They have not taken it off their site. 
[01:45:00]  They just, I guess, are going to continue with it.  That's the update.  Then we'll continue.  They're big summer promotion, I guess.  I guess so.  No problem.  It's weird to see an entire organization without dignity.  Oh, man.  Without any self-respect.  It is radio, after all.  There's never any dignity.  No dignity!  E-Rock's saying this is brutal.  Really?  The milk thing?  Yeah.  Dude, you were so, you were like.  It's nine years ago, though.  Yeah.  Can I say that at least?  It's the very beginning of XM. 
[01:45:30]  You were out of control.  I asked E-Rock, and he goes, oof.  Well, if it's 04, I mean, that was only in October.  05, officially.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Let's do something.  We're four months in at that point.  Was it January?  Oh, February.  Oh, boy.  February 2nd.  Wow.  Because I think at that point, I was starting to realize, fuck, we're just not talking to  anybody.  It was very frustrating.  Not to make excuses.  No, let's hear it.  I'll take my...  I just want...  Well...  I understand I have problems. 
[01:46:00]  Trust me.  I know that.  Did you hear yourself?  Dude, what did I say before break?  Oh, Christ.  Oh, man.  Why?  We'll do it after the break.  Oh, come on.  I want to hear something.  Sounds good.  Do you say magic has AIDS?  AIDS!  AIDS!  AIDS!  Yeah, AIDS!  AIDS!  Okay.  I'm going to use that one now.  Just... 
[01:46:30]  Just blurt out AIDS.  AIDS!  Just...  All right.  We'll play the milk thing after the break.  All right.  E-Rock said...  Oof.  He's got AIDS, E-Rock!  What has he done for the fact?  He's got AIDS!  His Simpsons Star Wars shirt.  I don't get it.  It's fucking horrendous.  Why?  Why is it horrendous?  It's just terrible.  Little childish cartoon characters  wearing childish fucking clothes  from another childish movie.  He does like a good childish mix-up, 
[01:47:00]  mash-up shirt.  He does, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Well, look, it's Dr. Who  if he made a doody in his pants.  Yuck.  People are asking if we covered  Charles Barkley's apology.  He didn't apologize, John.  We had the audio yesterday.  Do you have something else to add to that, John?  Hi, John.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, hey, hey, hey.  Thank you.  He didn't apologize.  We played the audio yesterday.  You did play the audio yesterday.  But I think the update,  unless it was a Photoshop, 
[01:47:30]  I just...  I quickly checked Twitter  a little while ago.  And is there a sign down there  in San Antonio now?  A billboard?  It says,  Long-haired, freaky people  need not apply.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, I think there's a billboard now.  San Antonio's fighting back,  unless someone kind of Photoshopped it.  Can you find the San Antonio billboard?  There's a...  San Antonio... 
[01:48:00]  Chuck, we thought about  getting Mayor Castro  to respond to you again.  But not this time.  This time,  the proud women of San Antonio  need to have a little chat with you.  You need to know,  San Antonio women lead our government  and run our businesses.  Our community is becoming more active.  In fact,  San Antonio's obesity rate  has dropped below the state average  for the first time  since you wore those tight shorts 
[01:48:30]  in the 80s.  Oh, damn.  Oh, fucking sexy.  Do you still fit in those shorts?  I don't think so.  The one on the left  has to be a little nervous about this.  Well, they can speak for themselves.  You don't define us, Charles Barkley.  We define ourselves.  Smart, strong, and bold.  And weren't you raised  by your grandmother?  Would she want to hear you  dissing us? 
[01:49:00]  Seems racist.  So, Charles,  we like you.  We really do.  But let's agree.  This joke is old.  That shit on the left is fast.  Stop dissing the women in the house.  Yeah, but lucky.  How'd they get them  for that movie?  And one more thing.  Go Spurs!  Go!  I don't mind that.  It's corny,  but at least they're, you know...  It's an epic fail.  But at least they're trying to, you know...  Epic fail.  I don't mind it  because they're not being self-righteous.  They're not going like...  Yeah, they're trying to have fun with it,  obviously, so whatever.  Go for them. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  You don't think that was a funny video?  Oh.  Hi, Kenny.  Do you have something today  for the show?  That video was an epic fail.  I'm getting all off.  It's like how Kenny gets on  those new internet sayings.  Yes, Kenny.  I learned something new  over the weekend.  Yeah.  Man-dime.  Compassion? 
[01:50:00]  What?  Man-dime.  Man-dime?  Yeah.  That's what you are, G-H.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Why would you say that?  What is the definition?  A piece of ass.  What's a man-dime?  Well, a dime...  Is ten.  Yeah.  Yeah, a dime is what, like, in hip-hop,  if you're a dime, it means you're a ten.  Right.  So a man-dime is a man who's a ten.  Kenny is flirting with Hobie.  I learned it over the weekend. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, where'd you learn that?  What rest stop you learned that?  That's right.  Well, you called a man penny.  I don't accept a man nickel.  Yeah.  I'm getting it back together, but I'll go with a man nickel.  I'd give you a man seven cents.  Seven?  Yeah, you're a man nickel and two pennies.  Getting there.  Slowly but surely.  I posted on my Facebook for 14,000 people to see.  Word of the day.  Wow, you're getting some numbers on your Facebook.  Nice.  Facebook what?  That's Facebook Club Soda Kenny.  Okay. 
[01:51:00]  That's the popularity of this show.  Certainly as a driving force in the media.  All right.  And someone also was saying that Sal is a rude prick.  What happened?  I don't know.  Mo in New Hampshire first.  Mo.  Hey.  What's up, Sal?  Sal, I just tried to hit up with you guys and let you know that that house explosion,  the cop over for domestic, walked in the door, got shot,  and then the police showed up. 
[01:51:30]  They got hit out, slowed him to a hospital, and he died.  Oh, wow.  I think the suspect was still in the house, set it on fire,  and then the house exploded.  I don't know who he was having a domestic with,  but I don't know how many bodies they're going to pull out of there today.  That's why domestics are so scary for cops.  They said that those are some of the scariest calls they go on.  Go to Beastie333 on Twitter.  He gets the big plug today.  He freeze-framed it as the body's flying out the window. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, I've seen that.  Well, I mean...  If there's a body flying out the window.  There, he even puts an arrow where the body is.  Is it a body?  Can we make that bigger?  Yeah, let's try to make that bigger.  Enhance.  Enhance.  So, you know, the house exploded,  and then he stopped it right where it looks like a body's flying out the window.  I don't know what that is.  It could be anything.  You don't know?  What do you think?  Swamp gas.  Maybe.  Jury still out on that one?  Fog.  Lights in the trees. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Maybe it's an ant farm.  All right.  And let's say hi to Frank in Arizona.  Frank.  Frank Gay.  Yeah.  It's got to say,  Sal should be shit-canned and fired from the company.  Yeah.  Why?  What happened?  He's just extremely rude on the phone.  He's a total asshole.  Thinks who he is, huh?  Yeah.  What happened?  What did he do?  We're Sal.  Get in here, Sal.  What did you do?  Defend yourself.  Giving you guff.  We're Sal.  Hold on, sir.  We've got to get her in here.  Hold on.  Run us through the phone call. 
[01:53:00]  What did he say?  Yeah.  More like what he didn't say.  He actually hangs up on people without even saying anything.  Oh, Sal.  We get so many phone calls that come in, though.  We specifically told him to wrap it up with right-o and bye-bye.  You're probably right, but we also can't be polite.  No, sometimes you've just got to bail.  You've got to run through these phone calls quickly sometimes.  Sal, he's calling you a rude prick.  Your rudeness is bothering people, Sal.  Do you remember this guy?  No, I don't remember him. 
[01:53:30]  What did he say?  He dated back in 2011.  Explain your phone call with Sal.  Sal, the unpaid intern treats me with complete courtesy and kindness.  You, on the other hand, act like a total moe and jerk-off.  Okay, how did I act like a moe and jerk-off?  What did I say?  Well, what you jerked off, too.  What did I say that made me a moe and a jerk-off?  Yeah.  You're a dick.  Okay, there you go.  You have no fucking facts to prove anything.  So what the fuck are you talking about?  You're just trying to stir shit up. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, here's a fact for you.  You're a queer.  Wow.  He got you, dude.  You're literally just a fucking nobody who's just trying to call in and start shit on nothing.  A nobody.  You ain't.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  You're such a fucking loser, Sal.  Okay, I don't care if you think I'm a fucking loser.  You're just a jerk-off calling into a fucking radio show trying to stir shit up with nothing backing it.  It's not just any radio show.  It's the greatest radio show in the world.  You got someone backing you, if you know what I mean. 
[01:54:30]  Ass sex.  Ass sex.  I didn't even know what I was saying.  You're a fine motherfucker.  Camping trip with other guys.  Back that ass up.  I honestly didn't even hear what he said.  He meant ass sex.  Back in that ass up.  That's obvious.  It was implied.  You're collecting wood in your asshole.  For a campfire.  Hey, Frank.  Frank, you know what the hoss say is, Frank?  It's an E-Rock that don't fly straight.  Anything else, Frank? 
[01:55:00]  Frank was better?  E-Rock the pig is my friend.  What did Sal do that was rude?  Yeah, what did I do?  Yeah, what did he do that was rude?  Well, it's like, I had a subject of a call.  It was a call to ask Anthony a question.  And he's like, oh, we don't want to talk about that right now.  I said, we don't want to talk about it.  I don't ever interject myself as a part of the show like that, ever.  I would never fucking say that.  Never.  Hey, Sal.  Sal, you better stop lying.  You won't get far in this world. 
[01:55:30]  Oh!  Rude and rude.  I don't know the fuck I'm dealing with.  This is crazy.  Now this is some crazy shit.  Sir, what if your call was not a good call?  It was a great call.  It was great as to your opinion.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Shut up, fucking Tangerine.  It was like a woman in that voice there.  What did you say?  I'm going to leave.  He was making fun at Sam's outfit.  He called him a Tangerine.  Why are you going to leave?  This guy's making great points.  He's making horrible points. 
[01:56:00]  I think he's making great points.  He is.  He called you Dick.  Ah, Dick.  Dick.  I know I'm a Dick.  Dick.  I know I'm a Dick, but this guy just has nothing to back up his point.  I don't know.  I think he's been pretty strong.  Oh, come on.  Kenny?  Frank, did you know Sal went on a camping trip?  All men.  Not a girl to be seen.  Nude sleeping bags.  Yes.  They even saw girls and made sure they went the other way.  So what if it was all guys? 
[01:56:30]  Like, who gives a shit?  It's a camping trip.  That's all it was.  Exactly.  We're living in...  It's 2014.  No, why?  Because you brought it up.  I didn't bring it up.  Most people just go, I went camping this weekend.  I did.  You said I went camping with a bunch of guys.  Well, yeah.  I think you said you were naked.  I openly admitted to a lot of things.  And you offered the, I was naked in my sleeping bag.  That's right.  Yes.  I did offer up information because we were just chatting.  Instead of having them dig a hole to take a shit in, you told them to use your mouth. 
[01:57:00]  That's true?  Oh, God.  No, it's not true.  Bury that here, boys.  Well, you don't want to leave anything for the Bears, so you've got to be careful, right, Sal?  Yeah.  They're the Bears.  Yep.  Bears.  Bears.  Double entendre.  Like hairy dudes.  You're a cub.  Damn, Sal, you got nailed.  Fucking guy in Arizona.  Lovely.  Yeah.  Sal, you went camping with a bunch of queebs and quees. 
[01:57:30]  Queebs and quees.  Not queebs and quees.  Yeah.  Damn.  All right.  I think we know who won this one.  Yes, Kenny.  Sal, you just got pwned.  Oh, man.  Using more new internet jargon that we've heard.  That's right.  Wow.  All the kids are using that one.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm going to win it.  All right, Frank.  All your base belong to me.  Team Frank.  Team Frank, you beat your ass. 
[01:58:00]  Jeff in Columbus.  Jeff.  Frank.  Hey, I'd like to stick up for Sal if you guys don't mind.  Go ahead, Jeff.  You know why I want to stick up for him?  Because he's got eight.  Oh, shit.  All right.  I'm going to go now.  This is why I don't like these callers.  What do you mean, you go now?  What are you doing that's more important than being on the air with us right now?  I'd love to stay, but I just don't want to.  And what do you mean, these callers?  What were you doing that's more important than this?  I was doing some research for the guest tomorrow. 
[01:58:30]  Who's on tomorrow?  You can stay.  We can?  I think so.  I would hope so.  Robert Duvall.  Ah.  Oh.  Yes.  I'm excited.  Tom Hagen.  Yeah.  All right.  He's got new movies for money.  I can has cheeseburger.  Now, we're going to take a break.  And that's your milk audio.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to that?  I certainly am. 
[01:59:00]  I'm sure I was there for it.  You were?  Yeah.  Fuck.  How am I going to spin this one?  Come on.  Fuck.  He's got AIDS.  Fuck.  Great sound. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  We've got to talk about 90s music one of these days.  Yeah.  We've never done a break on that.  No, we have.  Oh, literal, Jim.  Got a lawyer that wants to defend Sal.  Wow.  We got audio from 2005.  Oh, I've got to hear that.  Yes.  And Roland's in studio.  Just quickly, Roland went to the game last night.  Yeah.  Saw the Brooklyn Nets and the Miami Heat.  And Miami Heat is just kicking the Nets.  Is it Nets'? 
[02:00:00]  The Nets'?  How do you do that?  The Nets' ass.  Kicking the Nets' ass.  I say Nets' ass.  I think you have to put a, yeah, Nets' ass.  No, it's not Nets' ass.  It's the Nets' ass.  No, I'm going with Nets' ass.  The Nets' ass.  The Nets' ass.  Nets' ass.  Nets' ass.  Nets' ass.  I was an English major in college.  You didn't go to college.  That's a good point.  And I did, and I'm stupid.  How was the game? 
[02:00:30]  The food spread was delicious.  You, what?  He was sitting courtside, and that's his first thought about the game last night, that the  food spread was delicious.  Yeah.  Who puts that out?  The Barclay guy was very kind.  I went back to the food spread.  They had everything imaginable from snow cones to shrimp, sushi.  Shrimp.  Shrimp.  Did you have any?  Who eats snow cones and shrimp?  And shrimp.  And shrimp.  Well, they're in the ice in the first place, the shrimp, so.  C-H-T-R-I-M-P, shrimp. 
[02:01:00]  It's good.  And then that's where I saw Michael Killiams.  He said hello to Jimmy and you guys.  He didn't say hi to us.  He just said hi to Jimmy.  You were just trying to be honest.  He probably didn't say hi to me either.  Yeah.  He said, the only Jimmy makes me do crazy shit.  Oh.  I started eating his ass.  Did he say hi to Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Pinky swear?  Pinky swear.  I said, say hi to the guys for me, too.  All right.  And you said LeBron looks like a monster up close?  Yeah.  He's massive up close.  How do you get courtyard seats?  I just ripped?  Courtside. 
[02:01:30]  They had a seat down there and they go, come sit down here.  I was like, ooh, come.  That's not an explanation.  That's no.  How did you get courtside seats?  I was sitting like 10 rows up and then a seat opened right down there.  Right near the basket where the Nets were defending.  And they said, do you want to come sit down here?  Who said that to you?  The Barclays guy.  Oh, you know.  Yeah.  So I sat down.  The Nets defend both baskets. 
[02:02:00]  Well, the first quarter, wherever that basket they defended.  But as I said, the food was delicious.  Did you stay to the end?  I left when it was tight.  Why?  Why?  That's the greatest.  Because I was full and satisfied.  You were full and satisfied.  Your meal was finished?  I was done.  He was full and satisfied.  That's why he left.  Did you eat a lot?  I just had a lot of the shrimp and the sushi. 
[02:02:30]  It was delicious.  That's all I ate.  Sushi?  Yeah, it was delicious.  All right.  Why aren't you wearing your Michael Sam jersey to get high fives in the subway?  I don't think they give you high fives for that one.  Give me high fives for that one.  It's rolled into a fist and punched into your butt.  That's what I didn't want.  Or tugging your pee-pee. 
[02:03:00]  Roland likes wearing the latest shirt or jersey to get high fives in the subway, if you don't know yet.  How's that Star Wars one working out for you?  Are you getting high fives with the Star Wars shirt?  Yeah, I get some of those.  Like, yeah, I can't wait until it's out.  Like, yeah, right there.  He has.  That's why.  He started wearing Star Wars t-shirts every day.  Yeah.  After the J.J.  Abrams Star Wars news started to pick up.  Right, right.  That's not from the old Star Wars.  Yeah.  What are some of the shirts you've bought very recently to get high fives in the subway?  Han Solo.  I got some Han Solo t-shirts and a few more jets. 
[02:03:30]  And I bought foolishly three more Nets t-shirts.  But I'll invest in Miami soon.  He will be in here with a Miami Heat t-shirt.  Because I want to know LeBron.  And he goes, you're wearing a Nets t-shirt.  I'm like, my bad.  My bad.  My bad.  He said that to you or no?  No.  People, he just discussed.  We got.  Would you have conversations in your head and relay them as real talks? 
[02:04:00]  Yes, I see.  Did Roland think things?  Yeah.  He looked at Michael K. Williams in his mind on the way home.  He was like, you know, Michael goes, hey, I remember you.  Had a conversation.  And he believes it.  Yeah.  And he had pictures of that.  Snowy in Michigan is very mad.  A lot of people are very mad at something you just said.  I think left when it was tied would be what they would be.  Go ahead, Snowy.  I don't know if I'm mad.  I love Roland.  But who leaves a playoff game if it's a tie?  Not only is it a tie, he's in the front row.  His feet are on the court, basically. 
[02:04:30]  I kind of understand if it was a blowout or something like that.  Well, I got my stomach.  I fell out of my stomach.  I'm out of here.  This game's going nowhere.  It's a tie game.  But they lost.  It forced off.  And he said it perfectly.  He was full and satisfied.  Yeah.  Are they good, boys?  If you're full and satisfied, you've got to go home.  What time is it over, do you think?  10, 10.30.  I don't know.  The train's right there.  Yeah.  Literally right there.  Did anyone get hit away for the train or no?  Yeah, every 10 minutes. 
[02:05:00]  But I figured, eh, four minutes left.  Four minutes left.  Tied game.  This would be a good time to leave.  And that's like LeBron and those guys are getting all pumped up.  Those guys look like they're going to win.  So, adios, muchachitos.  The greatest.  He asked him how it was, and his first thought was shrimp and snow cones.  And sushi was delicious.  And the sushi was shrimp.  Right.  All right, Snowy. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, buddy.  We lost, so I hedged my bet, and I won.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Joe and Yonkers.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  We have a lot of people.  I just want to read all the calls.  Sal, go fuck yourself.  I want to agree that Sal's a prick, and Sal is rude.  Oh.  Where's Sal?  Okay.  Yeah, go ahead, Joe.  A couple things.  Number one, fuck Sal.  Number two, just for an update, snow cones and shrimp, definitely the blacks. 
[02:06:00]  No racists.  And you had to see me fucking scramble for that remote with the Michael Sam thing on ESPN.  I'm in the basement with my 13-year-old son, and I see this fucking guy going for a kiss,  and I'm diving across the fucking table for that remote.  My son's like, Dad, what's the matter?  Fucking saved his life right there.  Can I ask you a question?  And I'm not a parent, but what's the big deal if he just saw that?  Yeah, I don't know.  I could see it was porn, but, like, if two guys, what is the big deal?  Like, what's going to happen after that? 
[02:06:30]  You know what, Jimmy?  The fucking 45 minutes, I got to sit there now.  When I'm ready to just sit down and relax, instead I got to explain to my son what that fucking was that he just saw.  I just, I'm trying to fucking avoid that conversation.  All right, you know, there's a couple things going on here.  I kind of can agree with him slightly.  First of all, I don't care if my kid sees two men kissing.  Sees the gay?  I don't care.  I really don't.  But you do make a good point that sometimes you get in a situation where you're like, oh, fuck, this is going to be 45 minutes. 
[02:07:00]  I don't want to do it.  A long fucking conversation.  I give my kid timeouts just so I can check my numbers.  Unlawful imprisonment.  Parents, but you know what, Sal?  I mean, I was going to say, you know what, Sam?  Sorry.  But parents do this all the time.  To check their numbers, Sal?  Wait a minute.  Parents will do this all the time.  I'm like, the kid is like, ah, that's borderline timeout.  You know what?  Go into timeout.  And then you go and run and do something quickly because, you know, you have time to yourself finally. 
[02:07:30]  It's, you know, it's probably not right, but it is something that parents do.  Is that part of the outrage then?  It's not necessarily that they think it's going to destroy their kids.  But, like, isn't that, I know it gets easier for me to say, but isn't that part of being a parent is you've got to explain shit you don't want to explain?  So I know you don't want to waste 45 minutes.  But are you going to waste that 45 minutes eventually and explain that to them?  Yeah.  You know what it is, bro?  At that moment, that wasn't, I mean, if I'm going to talk to him about homosexuality, I don't want him to see on fucking ESPN a six foot fucking eight black guy going fucking attacking this little fucking white guy. 
[02:08:00]  And then have to talk about it.  Well, this is what, but this is what real, this is what real people talk about.  This guy is being dead serious.  And I don't know.  I think Michael Sam, you know, kind of gave it a little, a little extra.  I think Michael Sam gave it a little extra knowing that everyone was watching.  I think it's a better idea to have a kid kind of get some information out there in the world, know that that's kind of happening. 
[02:08:30]  And then if they're confused about anything, then you come and talk to the parents to have to just cold go into a conversation about gay lifestyle,  because there's two men fucking going at it on your television out of nowhere.  That seems a little more like you were blindsided as a parent.  I guess you want to do it on your time is what you're kind of saying. 
[02:09:00]  And SportsCenter seems like it's going to be kind of a safe place to go and watch something with your kid.  But then, you know, it's not like you have on some movie, some HBO movie, a Brokeback Mountain or something like that.  That's what all those people said about Janet Jackson's nipple, though.  Yeah, it's one of those things you just got to do it.  That was different because it was kind of played once, no one saw it, and then they blurted out, and then it was a big issue.  I had a Super Bowl party that day with a whole bunch of kids.  Not one fucking kid saw that and said, Daddy, what was it? 
[02:09:30]  Well, I wasn't a daddy back then, but or my brother's kids and my sister's kids.  Not one kid said, what was that, Mommy?  What was that, Daddy?  Not one.  But that's easier, too.  You could turn around to that kid.  The media blew that out of fucking proportion.  I know, but you could turn around to that kid and say, it's not all or nothing.  They're not all the same situations.  Just because that happened, you could turn to a young kid and say, that is a breast.  It's a woman's breast.  She, you know, uses to feed children with that. 
[02:10:00]  Like, it's easy.  To try to explain homosexuality to a kid is a little more of a dicey issue.  You know, first of all, I think a lot of fathers probably don't want a young son to even know that option's available.  To be quite frank with you.  That's not how it works, though.  Yeah, but a lot of people think maybe it works that way.  You know, there's a nature-nurture argument, and it's still an argument.  I don't think anyone's come up with the final solution to that one. 
[02:10:30]  I do think it's both.  I think there are people that are born absolute gay, but then I think there are people that kind of like that lifestyle and go into it voluntarily.  I think it's a two-headed snake, as they say.  But it's not, and I'm not talking about this guy as a parent, just in general, like, it's one of those things where they come after.  It's not like this guy just said he turned the TV off.  Okay, that's fair.  But what happens is then parent groups come after someone like this and go, well, we don't want our,  basically because they don't want to sit down and have that unpleasant conversation with their son. 
[02:11:00]  This guy is supposed to alter the way he behaves with the person that he loves.  And that's where the, it's like, then they come out and go, it was inappropriate, but it really wasn't.  He's supposed to change what he's doing because people don't want to have an uncomfortable conversation.  I don't think it's always that they just don't want to have the uncomfortable conversation.  That's probably part of it.  Sometimes you just don't want to deal at that moment.  Yeah.  It's like the conversation might be inappropriate even for a parent and a child at that age or that moment. 
[02:11:30]  Why are the two men kissing?  I'm not putting on ESPN to watch that.  Huh?  What?  I'm not putting on ESPN to fucking see that.  No, you'll put on your gay porn to watch that, sir.  Let me ask you this, Joe, the tough question.  So it turns out, and I apologize for saying this ahead of time, but it turns out your son's gay.  Now what?  Now what happens?  I love my son, and I don't hate anybody. 
[02:12:00]  But I want to be, I just don't want shit thrown in my face.  You know?  Sometimes it just feels like he gets fucking shoved down your throat.  Yeah.  No, you made that point, but you're not really answering my question.  It turns out, you know, he's gay.  Are you going to accept that?  Are you going to be okay with that?  Of course.  He's my son.  Okay.  All right.  I think that's the proper answer, to be honest with you.  Well, that fatherly bond is pretty strong, huh?  Hey, I'm happy for Michael Sand. 
[02:12:30]  I'm happy for him.  I just don't like how the fucking media just fucking jokes on it and wants to cram it down  your throat.  All right.  Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with you on that part.  And I really think that Michael Sand and his boyfriend there, you know, kind of went  in for a little extra.  A little extra.  They went in for a little extra knowing.  I mean, it's the first time cake was smeared in someone's face because they were drafted  in the NFL.  Show me another video where that happened.  Would you feel the same way if it was an interracial couple? 
[02:13:00]  Well, like, why is the...  I love black chicks.  No, but you know what I'm saying?  It's like, that would be like, that's a different thing.  And for a long time, that would have been considered shocking.  You're right.  But now it's like something that we're so used to.  And this is just the first one.  A year from now, five years from now, you won't even think twice.  You might not like it, but you won't be like, oh my God, because everyone will have  seen it multiple times.  I think explaining interracial relationships to a child is a hell of a lot easier than explaining  homosexuality to a child. 
[02:13:30]  I think it's just easy.  And not the fact that it's an awkward conversation.  It's just easier to explain.  You kind of have to get into certain aspects you might not want to get into when you're  talking about gay couples with a kid.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Stevie Knight, who's a good one on the Twitter, he just tweeted a Louis C.K. quote,  two guys are in love, and you don't want to talk to your ugly child for five fucking  minutes.  But I mean, you know, at that moment, it looks like Joe didn't want to fucking have to deal 
[02:14:00]  with it.  That's all.  All right, Joe.  I'd just say that some boys like boys, and some boys like girls.  Why?  I don't know.  That's just the way it is.  Oh, I could like boys?  If you want.  No!  Exactly.  That's what it boils down to.  That is what it boils down to.  And nobody will admit that.  No one wants to hear that, though.  But it's not.  Wait till you become a father.  It doesn't stop with that.  A kid will talk to you fucking want to jump out a window.  Yeah, but they have babies. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you.  They don't let it go with, oh, okay, thank you, Daddy.  It's like over and over again.  Can they have babies?  No, they can't have babies.  Why?  Right.  See, because shit isn't like an egg.  Oh, my God!  And if you come into a shit, it won't divide up and turn into a fetus.  Will that stop me from talking?  Oh.  Oh, okay.  I understand your point, Sam.  You've got to have the conversation, but they will not stop babbling sometimes. 
[02:15:00]  Kids have had dumb questions enough.  Figure it out on the streets like I did.  I had to play the round circle game all the way back from Philly this weekend.  What's the round circle game?  Just pointing out circles, which is fun for about two minutes.  How long is the ride from Philly?  It was a little traffic, about two hours.  I ran out of circles.  Yeah, why would you suggest that game?  And they kept going, it's your turn now.  Oh, the steering wheel.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[02:15:30]  And then it was his turn, and it went on the entire ride.  How about it's your turn to drive now?  How about that?  So don't tell me it's as easy as saying, you know, some boys like boys and some boys like  girls.  I'd probably rather...  It doesn't end with that.  I'd rather explain homosexuality than play the circle game.  Someday you'll have to.  There you go.  Everyone's been called gay today.  Oh, boy.  Except me.  Oh, well.  Other than that whole episode in the mirror.  I get it. 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  Everybody's making this way too complicated.  There's an easy explanation for kids.  Okay, let's say hi to Shannon in Virginia.  Shannon.  I think my point was just made.  I think you just addressed it.  Yeah.  But the point is, with kids, they don't need, you know, an explanation.  You don't need to go into everything.  Well, they keep asking their dumb questions.  Right.  But aren't they going to ask questions about whatever the topic is?  Like, if you're not explaining homosexuality, you're going to be talking about circles. 
[02:16:30]  I don't know if you're talking about circles, but homosexuality, a lot of people are, first  of all, aren't comfortable talking about it.  Secondly, it's a very difficult thing for just the layman kind of parent to talk about  and know if they're doing it properly, you know?  Wasn't Joe's kid 13, though?  Yeah, that's a little bit.  In this day and age, 13-year-olds kind of, they don't know.  Of course they know.  When we were growing up, we had three channels, and they kept the gay off the TV.  I was balls deep in buzz by fucking 13. 
[02:17:00]  It was nice.  Think about it.  We had people like Paul Lin and Liberace, and you want to talk about keeping the gay  off the TV.  They all acted like those guys were as straight as possible.  But kids today, they see the gay.  How dumb were we to not know?  We were dumb.  We were fucking dumb motherfuckers to not know.  Well, Ant does that great bit where the talk show host would ask Liberace when he's  going to settle down with a nice woman or lady.  Welcome back, Lee.  Any ladies in your life?  Well, you know something, Burr. 
[02:17:30]  I'm still looking.  I'm always looking.  It's like Mother used to say.  I need to settle down and find a wonderful woman.  Woman to be with.  Well, Lee, you know, time's running out.  A lot of eligible women out there.  Tell me about it, Burr.  And we're all watching going, yeah, why isn't he?  Why doesn't he have a lady?  He should have a lady in his life.  Lee.  So look, we've come a long way.  So relax with the Michael Sam kiss. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We've come a long way.  This one's taking a little more time.  I used to think that women.  Paul Lin was another one that they would always ask.  Because he was funny.  Right.  He was funny.  Oh, center square.  Oh, just so gay, over the top.  I had no idea.  Oh, and you'd have no idea.  He would tell blatant gay jokes in the center square.  He would?  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe if I flip my chair over.  Oh, I get it.  He's going to sit on a chair leg.  We didn't get it, though. 
[02:18:30]  We were like, ha, ha, he's an upside down man.  Right.  Fucking idiots.  Why would he do that?  Fucking Ronan Martin are laughing in the upper square.  Right.  Drinking, blowing each other.  Can you find...  Can we find...  Someone's got to put it together for us, though.  Paul Lin doing the center square.  Because Ant's right.  He had all sorts of crazy double entendre gay things.  Gay jokes.  And jokes.  Not where I live.  Yeah, they'd be like talking about straight sex or something.  It's like, well... 
[02:19:00]  Did the cock crow?  Well, no.  I shoved it in my mouth, an asshole.  Wow.  What's he mean by that?  The circle gets the square.  Can we hear a little bit of anything?  You got it, Sam?  Paul Lin.  Did you finish, Shannon?  I don't even know.  I think I did.  Okay.  Thank you, Shannon.  Thank you, Shannon, for your phone call.  Have a great day.  Trying to be more polite, knowing that I got...  I look like a complete asshole in the next segment.  Yes, no problem.  Let's hear some.  Here it is.  Oh, you got some?  Paul Lin.  For $500, Paul, sure or false, there is now a travel agency that specializes in nude cruises to Europe. 
[02:19:30]  I bet I know how to pick the captain.  New cruises, sir.  Is there an agency that specializes in nude cruises to Europe?  I'm not sure.  They're very popular over there, so I'd say yes.  The best looking man in the world, Paul Lin. 
[02:20:00]  Through a false.  Through a false, guy.  Yeah, what is it?  The more money you make, the more likely you are to take a drink now and then.  Is that why Catherine Kuhlman slurs her words?  I don't know what that is.  That's why he's so gay.  That's why he said someone's going to go through it.  Yeah.  He's so gay.  What delivery, though? 
[02:20:30]  Paul Lin had a fucking great delivery.  Yes.  How did he die again?  I took the tour in Hollywood, and it was just in some horrific way.  I think it might have been some horrific way.  I think it was auto-erotic, wasn't it?  I think so.  Right.  Look up how he died.  Amyl nitrate poppers and fucking...  I think someone was running out of his house at the time.  Yeah, it was...  It was like a circus going on in there.  Sam.  He really died doing what he loved.  That's the case for him.  Oh, yeah.  Heart attack.  Heart attack, but during what, you know?  No, it is a little more than that. 
[02:21:00]  What year, Sam, did he die?  82.  After Paul Lin...  82?  Hill?  Yeah.  January of 82.  Failed to turn up for a birthday celebration.  Couldn't get an answer on the phone.  Broke into the side entrance of his house, where he was found dead in his bed.  Stories suggesting Lind had a visitor at the time of death who fled the scene are not true.  Oh, okay.  Lind always put the house alarm before retiring for the evening.  Oh, embarrassed.  He broke in.  The alarm blared. 
[02:21:30]  They ruled the death.  A heart attack.  Oh.  When he and another friend, actor Dean Dittman...  Yeah.  ...cannot get an answer on the phone.  That's the people looking for...  Right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, let's go to John in Virginia.  John?  Hey, guys.  I don't think that, uh, gay football player realizes how much harder this is going to be  for E-Rock and Sam to explain pro wrestling to their kids.  You know, two oiled up guys rolling around grunting in the equivalent of women's underwear. 
[02:22:00]  There's people making...  There's men making out with each other on football.  Why would you help him out of that bottle?  Wow.  He just tripped and fell into a pit of explosions.  You picked him up.  I'm sorry.  Uh.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Well, I want...  I don't want to hear...  I want to hear some audio from them.  All right.  We can do that after the break.  Oh, sure.  Some milk audio?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll definitely do that next.  So stay right there. 
[02:22:30]  Jim Norton.  What's wrong with your arm?  What?  The shoulder?  It's below.  I always get a little tightness below the right shoulder, like in the middle of the back,  or the upper portion of the back, but I was just doing my chip walk.  And you pulled your...  Not pulled it, no.  But I was just doing it.  Here's the chip walk.  What are you doing?  Oh, you're getting the ball to...  Oh, I could use one of those. 
[02:23:00]  For real.  Tennis balls.  Right to the back, where the disc is.  Ah.  That feels good.  That feels nice.  How many tennis balls get used as other things?  Well, what are some of those things?  Basketball for midgets?  I'm thinking, like, the fucking most are fucking old people's walkers.  That's pretty brilliant.  Those fucking tennis balls...  You'd think they'd make something, though, that works better.  It's brilliant by the tennis ball people.  They can't even pick it up. 
[02:23:30]  They're just sliding.  Oh, it's terrible.  What's the two of that?  We're missing audio here.  What happened?  All right.  Someone's saying it doesn't have to be a 45-minute conversation with the kid.  That was more of a joke.  You know what I'm saying.  Of course, it doesn't have to be 45 minutes, but kids have a lot of questions.  A lot.  Yeah.  You don't want to be answering all those.  Well, my kid thinks he could spell.  Oh, really?  So now he throws letters on a paper. 
[02:24:00]  Thinks he can.  And then he tells me, what does it say?  It's not saying anything yet.  Oh, no.  You need to learn a little more.  So he just puts letters on?  Yeah.  He tells me, what is it?  Oh, boy.  And the combinations are not even close yet.  I mean, he's getting there, you know?  But he's convinced he now knows how to write.  So he's like, no, he just puts letters on.  There you go.  Right.  What does that say?  Fire this letter off for me.  And then I try, and I'll say, well, that's in.  But he'll do that over and over again. 
[02:24:30]  Because he really believes he can do it now.  All right.  So we go back to 2005.  I've been time.  I did explain myself earlier.  I'm not trying to come up with excuses.  I just try to give a little more.  It's probably not even that bad.  No, it's pretty bad.  It really is bad.  It makes me happy that I've kind of taken care of some issues.  It's not as bad as it used to be.  But there was a frustration involved when we first got to satellite.  You know, I know I sound like a complete and utter asshole here. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, man.  Just giving you some info.  That's all.  I'm not trying to make excuses.  It is what it is.  A little stressed out and angry.  And frustrated that we didn't have a lot of listeners.  There we go.  So I guess I lost it over milk one day.  I don't remember this.  This was milk diva, though.  We all had our diva moment.  Yeah.  Coffee diva.  It was me.  Coffee diva.  You were coffee diva.  And what was yours?  I was sorry to make coffee diva.  Probably beer diva.  Yeah.  Skin color diva. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we had a diva thing going for a while.  Yeah.  Steve.  But you haven't legit flipped out on anyone in the room in so long that I kind of forgot  that you used to be very angry.  I actually went to a therapist.  But that's boring for the radio.  I went to a therapist to take care of some shit.  It pops up every once in a while.  But I can't be that guy anymore.  It's ridiculous.  If you want to get serious for a moment, I understood it was hurting me.  I understood it made me look like a complete and utter asshole to people in the room and 
[02:26:00]  to some of the fan base.  I understand all that.  I do.  Yeah.  In hindsight, it was very entertaining.  Yes.  All right.  You're like King Joffrey.  So it was a milk thing going on this day in 2005.  I understand I have problems.  Trust me.  I know that.  Do you hear yourself?  Dude, what did I say before break?  What did I say?  I understand.  There's something that happens from time to time with me. 
[02:26:30]  Matter of fact, it was a promo.  Yep.  Because they forgot my potatoes.  Yes.  It wasn't about the potatoes.  My blood sugar level drops and I start losing my mind.  I understand all up with garlic.  Dude, I just played.  That is a real thing that I finally took care of.  Gary Wall used to notice that when we were at N.E.W.  Oh, yeah.  And he would come in before the show with Jell-O for me every day because he knew that I wasn't  like eating properly or taking care of myself in my, you know when you're, that level drops 
[02:27:00]  like that.  Do you get that ever?  No.  Fuck.  Why does it only happen to certain people?  Yeah, I guess.  I guess it only happens to assholes.  Yeah, because then they're hungry and they're like, oh, it's because I'm hungry.  But if they're really over stuff that you put, you go like, ah, come on, because I ate  too much.  There's no money.  I don't like the fact that he said potatoes.  Oh, I...  Potatoes.  Potatoes.  My bananas.  And I used to say what?  I don't say what anymore.  But.  But.  But.  What?  Remember the but?  That was supposed to be but.  Right. 
[02:27:30]  That was...  When I hear that on old tapes, it drives me nuts.  No, it wasn't put, but.  I don't remember now because I fixed it.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, what?  He put it in his trunk.  Yeah, yeah.  That was it.  When I hear that on old tapes, oh, but.  Put it away.  I want to.  Put it away.  I want to hide when I hear that on.  Put it.  Put it.  That was a good one.  All right.  All right.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  And is the blood sugar level dropping a real thing?  I don't even know, but.  I think it is.  I would get extremely agitated when that happened. 
[02:28:00]  I think for most people of average health.  Right.  That the body knows how to regulate that shit.  Yeah.  And unless you're really starving or something, it usually knows how to regulate your blood  sugar until your next meal.  Right.  For the most part.  All right.  All up with.  Dude, I just played a seven minute mashup song.  Not for the stupid audience.  I could care less about them.  Half of them went to another channel for a while. 
[02:28:30]  Well, I threw that on so we could take a quick commercial break and I could get some  food in my gullet so I don't pass out.  I am not talking about.  So I wrote a note during the while we're discussing the stupid tsunami song that I could  give a flying crap about, by the way.  But I figured it would fill up 20 minutes of radio today.  I wrote a note to Steve.  Steve, you know, SOS.  I need milk immediately, meaning my blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  So that was literally five minutes before we went to break. 
[02:29:00]  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around.  So I'm like, I'm a professional DJ.  Find what's called filler.  Thinking that the milk would arrive any second.  I would get the cereal in my effing stomach and then I would be fine for the rest of the  show.  Why am I so spitty?  What's that about?  You're angry.  Ugh, God.  Spitting mad.  That's emoting.  I'm spitty.  What the hell is that?  Ugh.  I don't know.  Oh, it's the processing, right, Dennis Falcone? 
[02:29:30]  There was no processing back then.  Oh, but you're listening to a board feed.  Right.  That's it.  That's all.  I think there's more.  I bet there's more.  There's a smidge more.  I am not talking about the situation at hand.  Guess what?  The milk just arrived!  I am talking about the fact that you sound like a madman.  And I understand.  I'm not saying I'm not.  With your milk.  His only crime is he was pulling it from a Duane Reade bag. 
[02:30:00]  Who the eff gets milk from Duane Reade?  And Opie unloads.  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Duane Reade.  You don't get milk from Duane Reade.  Opie unloads on him.  Why are you going to Duane Reade for the milk?  Because I need it right away.  There's a deli right downstairs.  Is there not?  You sound crazy.  Is there a deli right downstairs?  There is absolutely a deli.  And I agree.  They should have gotten the milk from the deli.  We have a bunch of retards that should be strapping bombs on them and walking around in Iraq. 
[02:30:30]  Then working for us.  Who would go to Duane Reade?  What the fuck does that even mean, you asshole?  It means that they should be killing themselves and doing some good instead of going to Duane Reade for your milk.  I took it to mean that Eric, in that case, Eric's level of skill was so low, he was only qualified to be a suicide bomber.  Oh, okay.  Do some good.  Kill yourself.  I hate this.  This is so uncomfortable.  Oh, it was a good one.  Yeah, I can't even blame this one on the N.E.W. or the old days.  Eric, do you remember when he said that you should be a suicide bomber? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, this is difficult to listen to.  Was it a tough time for you because he was still your hero at this point?  I think I'm, yeah, I was still on the hero list at this point, right?  Did we miss that line or just, in the break he said it?  What?  Yeah, he said it during the, like, he said before going to break, he just asked for somebody to get milk, so there was nothing there.  During the break, he didn't get a milk, so it started building up this anger, and Ant's going, what are you doing?  Just relax, it's coming, and then we come back from break and this happens. 
[02:31:30]  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hey, Opie, you love a nice glass of milk, huh?  Milk?  Did I say that wrong, too?  Yeah, you do.  Add it to the list.  There's a list out there.  Enjoy.  You don't say it wrong.  Milk?  I think I say it.  M-E-L-K, that's right.  Milk?  Milk?  Milk?  E before I, except after M.  Milk.  Milk.  Milk.  All right.  And those were the days when all that shit started popping up in drugstores.  Food, you're like, what?  Yeah.  Remember? 
[02:32:00]  Now it's normal.  It's old hat.  Yeah.  It really is.  I actually get my ice cream from CBS now.  Oh, see?  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Have you seen the Dwayne Reed downstairs?  No.  They sell sushi.  They have a salad bar.  They have a deli.  Sushi and a Dwayne Reed?  Yeah.  Great.  So if you get fucking food poisoning, you can just buy the kale peptide right there.  They have all in one.  They should just have it as part of the sushi.  Yeah.  Part of the kit.  All wrapped together. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  The sushi kit.  Yeah.  You get fucking baby wipes and, you know, Pepto.  And Benadryl in case you might be allergic.  They have yogurt machines.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what I call my cock.  What flavor?  Look, no one wanted to listen to me.  I was trying to, like, hold them off.  Yeah.  I didn't think this whole milk and fruit thing was going to take off.  It was in drugstores.  Stupid me.  You were intolerant.  Right.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now? 
[02:33:00]  Well, how come when I walked in, I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  I don't know.  I know.  He yells it to me.  Dude, where's my milk?  Like, I have a line on the milk getting.  You don't understand.  My meters are, like, dropping fast.  So it's called I go into a panic.  It's not that I'm a diva or any of that.  I treat these guys very nice.  Unless I get into one of these situations.  Oh, God.  This is so embarrassing.  You should have seen Eric.  I'm going to check my Twitter.  Oh, fuck.  I can't even check my. 
[02:33:30]  Check that.  It's attacking me there.  You should have seen Eric's face.  Fuck.  He attacked everywhere.  When the clip just said, I treat these guys very nice.  Right.  Eric.  Oh, dude.  His whole face crunched.  Did he roll his eyes?  During that period was a learning experience.  Were they the dark years?  Yeah.  I gave you life.  Remember?  Not without cost.  I gave you life.  Yes.  Everyone who's mean to the little minion says that.  I met you at a rest stop.  I gave you life.  Now you're yelling at me about milk. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  All right.  That's it.  I think there's more.  Yeah.  I listen to more at home.  Yeah.  There's more.  Everyone's coming up with the divas.  The foot diva day.  Oh, yeah.  The foot thing on my foot.  Yeah.  The foot thing on my foot.  That's one of the classics.  Yeah.  And you were coffee diva, too.  Oh, yeah.  Remember I had that brace on my foot for a while?  Yeah.  How long did I wear that for?  Did you?  Six months?  Yeah.  Was it that long?  Yeah.  On and off.  I finally got orthotics and my foot stopped swelling up.  Right.  Well, you had a foot thing on your foot. 
[02:34:30]  And then you kept hitting the thing underneath the console and it would get him so mad.  And then the panel fell on him.  Oh, the panel fell on the foot thing on your foot.  Oh, were you mad?  Wow.  Because I asked them before to fix it and they didn't fix it right.  And the foot thing, yeah.  And the foot thing fell on your foot thing on your fire.  I remember that.  But you didn't react like this.  This is just...  This is...  No, I was reacting to an injury.  Not because people didn't bring my fucking...  The milk from the proper location?  This is pussy shit right here.  I'll tell you right now. 
[02:35:00]  I was hurt, darn it.  Rub my neck.  Please?  Nope.  All right, here we go.  Eric, why wasn't the milk gotten from the deli that is right downstairs from this very  building?  And the best part so far is when the codependent wife sticks up for the abusive husband.  Now I'm blaming E-Rod.  Now why?  It's just a dysfunctional family moment.  I kind of hear it in your voice.  You're kind of enjoying it.  Oh, I am.  That was in my fucking mind.  I definitely was.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Okay, one.  I didn't send him, so I don't know where he went.  Two, apparently I've been told they don't sell milk downstairs at that deli.  They don't sell milk downstairs, Danny?  They don't have sealed milk downstairs at the deli.  I don't care if it's sealed.  They'll put it in like a coffee cup.  But that's fine.  Oh, see now, how is anyone to know?  You wouldn't come up with that and go, what is it?  I don't know what that animal's doing.  It's open.  It's open.  It's an open container, Tina.  Hold on.  No, that's where I'm different than Jimmy. 
[02:36:00]  I don't really care about that.  Especially under this situation.  I just need to get food in me.  I don't care.  Well, I kind of understand.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  You know what we need?  We're going to make an E-Rock joke.  Yeah, look at him.  Go over there and serve your master.  Yeah, well, you know, he was thinner back there.  Now we'd say go throw your hairy tits right in his mouth.  No offense.  No offense.  I love the no offense.  None taken, Jim.  Don't worry about it.  You know what we need?  Emergency Parmalat milk. 
[02:36:30]  You put it in a cabinet somewhere and it lasts forever.  It sits there and then when you open it up, then it's got to be refrigerated.  But it's like in case of emergency, break glass.  And you have your milk right there.  We have that.  I said that when I came in.  Stop it.  We have whole milk Parmalat.  That's all we have.  And he looked at me and did nothing.  Because I didn't know what that was.  No.  I really didn't know what that was.  No, it's regular milk.  It's just been processed in a way that it's good until you open it.  It's like, here's the other problem.  There is milk in the refrigerator, but you don't know if it went sour or anything. 
[02:37:00]  That's Parmalat right there.  I really don't know what that is.  It's milk.  It's real milk.  There's nothing different about it.  It's just the way it's processed.  It can last sealed.  It can last for a long time.  Oh.  Yeah.  We were really having an intense milk break.  We made my Parmalat.  There.  Parmalat.  Yeah.  For Parmalittle.  I was thinking of that.  For Parmesan.  You know, maybe King Arthur and Parmalat. 
[02:37:30]  I think I liked it better when you guys were yelling about milk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think this is going well.  We should just tap out of this.  I don't know more about that.  I think it's going well for most people.  It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Oh, good.  Good.  Anthony brought it up during commercials going, dude, you sound like a rating.  I had to look right at Opie and go, you sound like a madman.  You're trying to wake me up out of this weird coma state I get into.  It has nothing to do with being like, you know, Patrice from Brazil is saying, come on.  Come on. 
[02:38:00]  I feel the whole blood sugar level thing dropping in my body drastically, okay?  We still have a radio show to do.  And then I'm looking at the clock and all the meters, you know, counting down thinking,  I don't have enough time to eat before we get back on the air.  Right.  And then they walk in with the milk in a Dwayne Reed bag.  I'm like, I know where Dwayne Reed is.  It's not close to here.  No.  So who went and got it?  Ricky.  Oh.  Of course it was Ricky.  He stinks.  Opie wants milk. 
[02:38:30]  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  No Dwayne Reed.  Never Dwayne Reed.  And Dwayne Reed was right across the street.  And who cares that the milk came from Dwayne Reed?  It was there.  Who cares?  It was there already.  Like, get over it.  Yeah, who cares?  It's like, I'm even thinking of my old self.  I wouldn't care about that.  As long as it's refrigerated.  What the hell is going on?  You didn't like waiting.  That's the expiration date on it.  It was the waiting thing?  Of course.  You didn't like it.  You didn't get it fast.  And if they would have brought it from Whole Foods, you would have said, why Whole Foods?  Yeah, I wouldn't care where it came from. 
[02:39:00]  Show up my nut counting.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Plus, Dwayne Reed was probably more economical than the deli.  For the milk.  It's a stand-alone beverage.  Stand-alone viscous drink.  Little problem, maybe?  All right, so then this is a little later in the show.  A little later in the milk.  The milk show. 
[02:39:30]  Little problem, maybe?  What about Bob Kelly?  A little setting problem?  Oh, thanks, Eric.  Why don't you just send him for milk?  Why would it matter if Bob Kelly's here?  He's got to tell you, though.  I saw him.  Where?  No, you saw him.  I thought you might have breaking info about the jet crash.  He's holding up a big sign.  Bob Kelly's who cares.  Bob Kelly was in the plane?  What?  He's good to goof on for 10 minutes.  I don't care.  I thought you had breaking news about the plane crash. 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  Next time, get the milk faster.  Jesus Christ, it's insane.  Oh, God, that sounds horrendous.  Finally, it ends here.  Uh-oh.  There we go.  You're done with your cereal?  Just about.  See you.  All right, everyone, stand down, everybody.  You may stand down.  Everyone, stand down.  Obi has completed his cereal.  He's bad, man. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  I understand.  Just insanity.  It's quite embarrassing.  I understand.  I'm not going to feel too good about myself later when I listen to the replay.  Will there be some guilt and stuff?  Of course there will be.  Why did I do that?  The Captain Queeg and Anthony show.  I knew there was milk somewhere.  All right.  There was milk, but he went down to Dwayne Reed.  He could have gone right down to the deli.  I just couldn't comprehend the Dwayne.  How many portions of milk did you get from Dwayne Reed?  How many did you get from the deli? 
[02:41:00]  I just couldn't comprehend looking at a Dwayne Reed pharmacy bag and going,  and that's why I had to wait.  That's why.  They're selling milk in drugstores now?  That Dwayne Reed bag set you off like I've never seen a shopping bag set anyone off.  He went insane.  He saw that big Dwayne Reed logo and lost his mind.  It was.  It was like watching, what's her name, looking at that wire hanger in the closet.  Yeah, I know.  Little kids don't get that upset when they see a little bag in a stall in a men's room. 
[02:41:30]  Sprinkled.  The old lad bag.  Jimmy's the only one that sounds exactly the same when we play these older tapes.  Because I'm youthful.  Aw.  That's what people say.  Your charm is in your youthfulness.  I say, oh, come on.  They say, no, really.  That's kind of embarrassing, that one.  Sorry.  That's funny.  I will officially apologize for acting like an asshole.  Apology clock already years ago.  I'm only apologizing for February 2nd, 2005, though. 
[02:42:00]  Just the one day?  That's right.  So go fuck yourself.  I'll only apologize for that day.  Years and years ago.  Mm-hmm.  There's something I want to say.  I don't get that anymore.  Ah, whatever.  No one has a fuck.  My blood sugar level doesn't drop anymore, so what is that, for real?  Is that, like, change your diet up a little bit?  Fucking pancreas is running a little better.  It's called maturity, GH. 
[02:42:30]  Holy piss.  I don't know why.  I don't get that as much anymore.  Or at all.  Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  Hey, yeah, don't forget the time I, it was one of the first times I tuned in, and you  were highly upset about something, and all I can remember is you were trying to eat your  yogurt, and just staring around and looking at everybody, and you were, like, telling  Anthony, we're done.  We heard there was a yogurt diva once.  That's right.  A yogurt diva.  I think that was our big fight.  Yeah, it was probably one of those.  A yogurt fight?  We've had a few fights.  Who was eating yogurt?  Anthony was eating yogurt.  I don't know. 
[02:43:00]  I don't know.  I've never gotten back and listened to that.  It's one of those ugly days.  Casey Kasem is missing.  This is the weirdest story.  I thought he just...  Oh, it's a weird story.  Wait a minute.  It's so weird.  I know.  It's very weird that...  You think it's weird?  Casey, I think this is weird.  It's probably the weirdest news of the day.  Super weird.  I think.  Hmm.  Yeah?  You think?  I can't think of it.  Some are odd and some are strange stories that are very strange. 
[02:43:30]  Weird news.  Yeah!  Ladies and gentlemen, Casey Kasem, seem to be missing.  Seems to be.  1980?  Yeah, 1980.  We might remember American Top 40.  Casey was doing it.  Now he's missing.  It'll make some awful joke at the end of it.  Weird.  Someone says, just look for him on the Top 40 show.  Yeah, we were there.  A long distance search.  You think he packed his Casey and left? 
[02:44:00]  He had to pack his suit, Casey.  Suit, Kasem.  Kasem.  Yeah, whatever.  You know what I mean.  Whatever.  You know what I mean.  But that's weird news.  The Casey Kasem story is a very good example of what the news does.  Yeah.  When I first heard this, I'm like, wow, he just took off.  And he's wandering around somewhere.  And we've got to go find him.  I thought there would be helicopters in the sky and all.  But then you, and they're smart.  That's what they want you to think.  And then you watch or read just a little bit and you realize that, you know, the wife of his there is just kind of moving him around. 
[02:44:30]  Why?  What is he?  You fucking secret?  There's family shit going on.  I guess the kids don't get along with the wife.  So why do you got to keep moving Casey around, like, to hide him?  That's a weird thing.  I don't know.  Maybe they're trying to get to his money or have him sign shit before he dies because he's in really, really bad shape.  Parkinson's, yeah.  Parkinson's, I don't think he even, he doesn't even talk anymore.  Shake, you case him.  So he's in rough shape and she's moving around for whatever reason.  That's all this is.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  And the kids, basically, and the other family members don't know where he is.  They say an Indian reservation.  Why an Indian reservation?  Is he part Indian?  Maybe.  I think so.  Maybe better protection there or something?  I thought he was, like, Mideastern.  His name was Kasim or something.  Maybe certain laws don't apply in the reservation.  Yeah.  Let's see.  A judgment Monday ordered an, oh, sorry.  No, it was just, where, where?  Where the fuck am I?  I'm in the top 40 or something. 
[02:45:30]  Chipper Kasem.  Yeah.  Sarah, what are you going to dedicate something?  I'm missing.  I dedicate that to whatever.  Good one, Chipper.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  How about Casey Kasem?  How about Anthony Kasem?  Casey.  Thank you.  End up.  A judge ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of Casey Kasem.  Ah.  After an attorney for the ailing radio personality's wife said the former Top 40 host has been removed from the country. 
[02:46:00]  Wow.  So the wife just said he's been removed from the country.  What is that about?  Is she a twat or?  I don't know.  Uh, Los Angeles Supreme Court Judge, uh, Murphy ordered a court investigator in Adult Protective Services to find out where Kasem is being treated and report back to the court.  He's 82, suffers from Parkinson's, advanced Parkinson's, that's rough, can no longer speak and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife, Jean Kasem.  She was a lot younger, wasn't she that blonde? 
[02:46:30]  That bimbo, that blonde bimbo that was on Cheers a few times?  You think she's trying to keep the money safe from the kids?  You gotta think at this point, if the guy's not even really, uh, you know, functioning properly.  Uh, Casey Kasem's children have complained that they have been unable to see their father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother.  Uh, daughter Carrie Kasem had sought a temporary conservatorship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday.  Her attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to an Indian reservation in Washington State. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  Uh, Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing.  He said he did not know where the radio personality was, but knew that he had been removed from the country.  How, how much do you think they hate this stepmother?  Wow, right?  It's all the kids, though.  So what, all the kids are complete assholes that the stepmom has to do this?  Or maybe she just wants the money.  They're fighting over his money, it seems like.  Are they the Kasem's right there?  Where's no stepmother?  Oh, you've seen her before. 
[02:47:30]  She used to parade around with him.  She was like, she seemed like she was like six foot tall, really a lot taller than any of these Kasem chicks, uh, any good?  I'm Casey Kasem.  It's all fun.  And now, a long distance dedication to me.  I don't know where I am.  It's very far away.  Yeah, I'm gonna dedicate my back out of this lady.  Chippy Kasem.  Chippy Kasem.  I'm Chippy Kasem.  She's, she's a monster.  Let me see. 
[02:48:00]  She's huge.  The letter reads, Dear Casey, where the fuck are you?  I wanna take your money.  I wanna, hey, someone wrote me or something and said, my dog disappeared.  Can you go find it or something or step in poop?  I'm working at a paint store as a can shaker.  See, Parkinson's.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  I'm serving martinis and fucking spilling them. 
[02:48:30]  Clever.  I can't make this third guy.  I, I'm Casey Kasem.  And I was holding a knife and I stabbed a bunch of fucking people.  That's not, is that terrible?  I don't know.  That, uh.  Oh, wow.  From Hurt Locker.  I can't even buy milk.  Oh, and I interned 2005.  Damn.  Good Photoshop.  Whoever did this.  G. Butera.  Oh, and I.  There he is.  You know, they still feature, uh, Casey Kasem on, uh, I believe it's the 70s channel. 
[02:49:00]  They do it on every one.  Here on Sirius XM.  They do the 80s, too.  Do they do the 80s also?  Yes, they do.  American Top 40.  They, uh, run through it, I believe, uh, on, uh, uh, maybe it's a Sunday.  Well, I don't know.  You wanna ask, uh, Dennis Falcone?  I'm trying to cross-promote other, uh, other channels here.  But you're not doing it properly.  I know, I know.  Do you wanna ask Dennis about it?  They rerun the American Top 40, and they're like, this from the first weekend in September 
[02:49:30]  of 1976.  We should rest in a little bit.  And now, Philadelphia Freedom.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed to say that I like a good countdown.  I like a good Casey's countdown.  And for some reason, it's the dumbest thing.  I bet Elton's gonna find a nice young lady to settle down with.  Right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, boy.  Uh, Kerry Kasem resigned from another show two weeks ago. 
[02:50:00]  What does that mean?  She was doing radio herself?  I don't know.  Hey.  We didn't need you today.  We just need the cross-promotion.  It's amazing how we can take a lousy idea and run it into the ground.  But I, I don't know why he's in here.  I was, I was doing the joke part of it.  I wanted to know what, when the Casey Kasem's American Top 40, uh, is on.  Uh, noon, Eastern, Saturday, and, uh, Sunday morning, 9 a.m.  It's a replay.  On what channel?  The 70s on 7.  70s on 7.  Yeah.  Cool.  Thank you. 
[02:50:30]  Thanks.  The piss god, everybody.  Those are good.  Oh, the piss god.  Those are great to hear those countdowns.  I think you'll love those countdowns.  Ten more until you have a mouthful of piss.  This one working its way up the charts.  And you were talking about Jean Kasem?  She was on Cheers, remember?  Jean Kasem.  That's what your delicious cock is covered in.  This one working its way up my chest.  I'm going to fill my own mouth with my own cock and warm piss.  I'm Danny Falcone.  Oh, you piss on yourself, bro.  Yeah, I'm going to lift and drop my knees and pump my prick into my mouth. 
[02:51:00]  It's raining men.  Yeah.  And I'm making it rain all over my mouth.  Did you ever find the other Casey bit when he goes off?  Lotion ring.  Crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Love that one.  You know that one, right?  Pre-cum on my lips.  That's funny.  Sure.  He starts reading the letters.  Yeah.  And he's drinking.  Five?  Tomorrow?  Five?  You have a syndicated show.  You don't want to be on five o'clock in the morning.  Speaking of tunnel of love.  Find the Casey Kasem bit.  That's funny.  We've heard the Casey Kasem bit. 
[02:51:30]  Why is there a bunch of guys sucking their own cocks, Sam?  You know what?  There might be somebody who never heard it.  They've all heard the dog dedication.  Which one best represents your...  I don't like any of them.  Why?  I like Casey Kasem.  I don't like this stuff.  You're a self-suck kind of guy.  Yeah.  He said if we continue, he's not going to do our show anymore.  Remember.  Let's be careful.  Doug in North Carolina.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Carrie Kasem did a radio show with Nikki Sixx up until about two weeks ago for like five 
[02:52:00]  or six years.  Six a.m.  And she just out of the blue resigned two weeks ago.  Didn't give any indication of what's going on.  Out of the fucking blue.  Yeah.  That sounds like...  No offense, because Nikki Sixx is kind of entertaining, but that sounds like it would  be a horrendous show.  What do they talk about?  Or hang up.  In the middle of the conversation.  Huh?  Oh, God. 
[02:52:30]  Dennis keeps looking at self-suck photos to see if he can improve his own technique.  Jimmy tricked me.  He goes, what is that?  You got loosey-goosey hips, so I think...  Yeah.  Let's figure out which form would be the best for him.  He's on his back and...  Loosey-goosey hips.  Throws those fucking busted legs over.  Oh, yeah.  The way you throw like a fucking...  Just a gunny sack full of shattered bones over your legs.  And he gets that fucking commensis to suck it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I don't think you would do that position, because that would hurt the neck.  I think with the loosey-goosey hips, you could keep your back flat pretty much.  Can we play some Casey Kasem bits? 
[02:53:00]  No.  Snip us to the countdown?  There's only one bit.  No.  It's weird.  Countdowns are great.  But it's weird that he likes to do that to himself while somebody else pisses on him.  That is weird.  You know what I mean?  It seems like Dennis doesn't get distracting when you're getting pissed on to also have to...  Countdowns are the best.  I used to sit in my room writing down all the songs and then go to the record store.  Sucking your own dick.  Yeah.  Buy them.  It is weird, though.  Let's say you're doing it.  Let's say you have a mouthful of your own prick.  And somebody starts to piss on you, and they're like, do you like this?  Do you go, uh-huh.  Do you do that?  Uh-huh. 
[02:53:30]  No.  Wow.  Have you ever let yourself grow in your own mouth?  I'd like to end this right now.  Have you ever popped it in your mouth so often and been amazed at how much easier it was to suck when it was hard?  No.  It's 1978, and grease was rising up the charts.  And now I'll grease up my cock while I slide my mouth down on it.  Yep.  Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching your mouth around your cock.  A little self-suck.  Because you can feel it get harder in your mouth as the tinkle hits your back, right?  Oh, God. 
[02:54:00]  I guess you would know that, Sam.  Oh!  Sammy Roberts.  I mean, I mean, you know.  You speak from experience, I guess.  We've all tried.  No, we've never tried.  Not all of us are as successful as Mr. Self Suck.  No, I'm just happy walking down the hall and sitting down.  Okay, I'm excited by doing that.  I don't bet.  All right.  All right, thank you.  All right, anytime, guys.  Thanks again.  Yeah, thanks for that useless information.  It reads, dear kids.  The guys at work keep teasing me about sucking my own cock.  How do I get them to stop? 
[02:54:30]  Well, sign DF.  Yeah.  Well, you should be happy that you could suck your own cock.  You found the one thing that bothers him.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  We have the outtakes, you said.  The Casey Kasem outtakes.  That one we don't play as much as the dog one.  I love the old Casey Kasem outtakes.  Can we hear some of those?  The countdown will begin this Sunday afternoon at 1, right here on the radio station you grew up with. 
[02:55:00]  Music Radio 138.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here?  Geez, isn't it the last hour?  We got another hour to do?  Geez, I thought we were almost finished.  Good golly, Miss Molly.  Boy, this is fucking ponderous, man.  Ponderous.  Fucking ponderous.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2, 2. 
[02:55:30]  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere, and it'll need a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of... 
[02:56:00]  Let's start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions.  And then you've got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for, but goddammit, if we can't come out of a slow record.  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo record every time I do a goddamn death dedication. 
[02:56:30]  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.  Since the last goddamn time, I want somebody to use his fucking brain to not come out of a goddamn record that's up-tempo,  and I've got to talk about a fucking dog dying.  He's totally right.  He had told those lazy fucks to not bring me out of the happy record and give me this dog dedication,  and those lazy shits didn't do it. 
[02:57:00]  I heard his milk didn't do it.  I was going to say, where is the milk I asked for?  Where's my goddamn milk?  Yeah, I want a goddamn Duane Reade.  From a Duane Reade?  You don't bring milk from a goddamn Duane Reade.  Yeah, I come out of an up-tempo number, and I've got to drink goddamn pharmacy milk.  Oh, wow.  Oh, ponderous.  Well, they'll find Casey.  Well, as long as he's safe.  They'll hear him with something dedicated right now.  God, imagine that. 
[02:57:30]  He can't talk anymore.  That's horrible.  He's going on the radio.  His head.  He's fucking introing records in his head.  Over and over again.  How funny was it that Doberman pinch her head?  You got annoyed at that.  Fucking tiny skull.  Danny looks like he offended a witch doctor.  He shrunk his head.  The end of Beale Juice.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He said the wrong thing.  Pointed at his head.  Went ooga booga.  And it shrunk.  Every Saturday.  Oh.  And he can't find a hat that fits. 
[02:58:00]  No.  He puts hats on his head, and he just spins them rapidly around.  Fucking tiny-headed goose egg.  He really is.  He has to wear an eggshell on his head.  He paints it like an eggshell with something flat.  He tells everyone it's a baseball hat.  It smells like eggs.  And fucking his little thin, narrow head.  He does have a little head.  It's awful.  It really bugs me. 
[02:58:30]  So, we had Elvis Duran talking about us.  And what happened there?  He's pretty big these days, huh?  Yeah.  He's on a lot of stations.  He's on a ton of stations.  He's out of New York.  They syndicated him.  He's doing pretty well around the country.  Oh.  And word got to him about our Ty Bentley thing.  Some asshole in New York decided to kind of try to do the with my Wednesday thing.  Yeah.  And it's still on that website, too.  Blatantly take it. 
[02:59:00]  How embarrassing.  Yeah.  How fucking embarrassing.  Same company that was trying to shut us down from doing it, actually.  That's the weird part.  Of course.  They were ready to shut that down, but then we got fired.  It's a new day.  For the Sex with Sam thing.  I have been howling, by the way, for days, reading their tweets.  The tweets at him and that company really have been making me laugh.  There's a fake Ty Bentley, by the way.  No, I know there is, but I mean the real one.  A lot of people don't, though.  Oh.  They're fighting with the fake Ty Bentley.  What's going on, E-Rock, with the Elvis Duran? 
[02:59:30]  You kind of know a little something-something about radio.  You're in the business.  You like this inside stuff.  Oh, yeah.  So word got around about your rant with Ty Bentley, and then I got word that the Elvis Duran show  got a chance to listen to it.  It turns out they're fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  Who isn't at this point?  Oh, just an amazing array of stars.  It was good exposure.  Did you hear that Scott Shannon went up again?  Yeah.  Elvis Duran's number one in New York. 
[03:00:00]  Scott's now number three.  Come on, Scott.  Is he doing better than Todd?  Well, Scott has a 5.8.  Wow.  From what?  What did he start with?  Well, he was fair.  This interview I read, it started off with like a 5.0.  So the first book, he came in at a weird time, so that first book does credit him, but  he's at a 5.8 right now.  He'll see where he is with the next book.  But Todd has dropped to 1.6.  Because there's something hateable about him. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Because he's not, he's a phony.  Yeah.  He thinks he's doing all this new, the grassroots stuff.  And he's doing the exact same shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep it local.  Yeah.  Keep it local.  Real funny, real people.  Yuck.  When Scott was still with Scott and Todd, they were ranging from a 2.8 to a 3.0.  And when Scott left, he's at a 1.6.  And by the way, I have it on very good authority from someone who knows Scott that they absolutely  threw Scott out.  That was from someone who knows him, a radio guy who knows him well. 
[03:01:00]  You could tell by the goodbye that that was what was going on.  It was a terrible goodbye.  Most of the people on his show now were at PLJ.  And they all got thrown out at some point.  He wants to make it younger.  You know, Todd thinks he's young and hip, but it's just awful.  Yeah.  So they're all now on Scott's show, Patti Steele and Joe Nolan and Mr. Steele.  Yeah.  Is that?  Yeah.  She's still around.  Mm-hmm.  Good for her.  Yeah.  30, almost 30 years in New York.  Jesus.  We're always cool to her, right? 
[03:01:30]  She's very nice.  Okay.  Elvis Duran talked about us, I guess, here.  Yeah.  I mean, I always talk back to the radio.  I always talk to people on the radio.  Mm-hmm.  You know, sometimes when I'm driving around and listening to, you know, I flip around like  most people do.  You know, I was listening to, oh, Opie and Anthony the other day over on SiriusXM.  I love talking to them because they have these conversations.  I feel like I'm in the room with them.  Yeah, right.  And you know what, Bethany, you wouldn't like Opie and Anthony.  Because I don't like anything? 
[03:02:00]  Because you don't like anything.  Yeah.  No, but I know Danielle's a big Opie and Anthony fan.  Love Opie and Anthony.  Well, anyway, so I feel like, what do we got here?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my cock just jumped.  Hello, Danielle.  Let's see what she looks like.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Danielle is there.  Because I want to.  Well, let's see.  Perhaps.  Let's see what Danielle looks like.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see what's going on here.  Hey, wait a minute.  This could be my chance.  All right.  Okay.  Another redhead for my chance here, huh? 
[03:02:30]  Maybe?  She's not bad.  This is her with her husband.  Boo!  Boo!  What does he do?  Is he a famous millionaire radio personality?  I don't know.  Boo!  All right.  Where's the one who wouldn't like Opie and Anthony?  I don't like that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think she's new.  Okay, good.  Oh, she's fired.  Love Opie and Anthony.  Well, anyway, but I feel like they have these long conversations. 
[03:03:00]  Do we have to stop down and play Happy by Pharrell from time to time?  Yeah.  But they can talk for like four hours without ever taking a break.  It's awesome.  They must pee in their pants while they're doing their show.  I don't know how they do it.  But I feel like you start talking to them and you realize, wait a minute, they don't hear  me.  You wonder why they're not responding or laughing at your joke?  It's true, but we're talking to them.  So, anyway.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  We're talking to you.  Hi, Elvis.  Hey, Elvis Duran.  Hi, the guy.  That's kind of cool.  Cute chick with the red hair.  Do you think you'll get a laugh when he goes, they must pee their pants if you're on a 
[03:03:30]  show and forgot your regular radio?  Yeah.  I said, no, we're just pissing Denny's asshole.  Oh, God.  He'll fast enough to dump out.  Yeah, that'll be a quick dump.  He's not happy.  No?  He doesn't work blue.  He's very quiet, sitting very, uh, working hard at his desk.  Well, what's he expect?  And he's a good guy.  Old eggshell baseball hat.  Yeah, he should have kept that one under his hat.  I don't know what to tell you.  Exactly.  I like Doberman Pinscher head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's a tiny little thin head.  Man.  He's a man's sleight of head. 
[03:04:00]  Sleight of head?  I think you've done enough.  You can go home.  Oh, yeah.  You're calling it.  No.  Thank you, Iraq.  Thank you.  No, you guys are good for another eight minutes.  No, with spots, it'll be 10.30, and then you can start right at 10.30.  Nobody wants me to start right at 10.30.  It's irresponsible for us to take some of your time away from you.  Everybody wants you to go until 10.30.  We did.  Or 11.  We officially went to 10.30 with spots. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Everybody would like the radio to go until 10.30.  Radio?  No, we have nothing else.  What is it now?  Fucking 55 degrees out?  I think it's nice today.  No, it's going to get cold.  It's going to be in the upper 60s.  It's 72.  73, yeah.  Wait, let me do my refresh.  I was getting all pissed off yesterday that today's weather was going to be cold, and then  I thought, like, why don't I just enjoy that today's nice?  Because I'm there going like, oh, tomorrow's going to be all fucked up. 
[03:05:00]  It's all nice today, but tomorrow's going to be...  I'm like, but it's right now.  Because you like being angry.  No, then I realized, and I just fell asleep on my pool floatie, and it was wonderful.  What time do you have?  I was all burned.  Isn't that scary to sleep on that?  It is kind of scary.  You do wake up kind of going like, ah, where are you?  Like your arms are in the water.  I'm sure you'd wake up if you rolled over.  Sure.  You would wake up immediately.  No?  Yeah.  I think you would.  It's just kind of a cool little floating thing. 
[03:05:30]  You drift off to sleep.  It was fucking great.  But not today.  Today's going to be more fucking going shack-wacky staying in the house.  Mm-hmm.  Going to rain?  This guy says...  Not today, tomorrow.  We got rain tomorrow?  I'm a fucking cunt.  Let's say hi to Joey in Maine.  Joey, last phone call of the day, I believe.  Joey.  What's up?  Yeah, I got a nickname for Denny.  If I could blow my own bone, Falcone. 
[03:06:00]  Wait, you got a nickname for him?  Sir?  I really didn't hear a lot of that.  Blow my own bone, Falcone.  Is his nickname?  Is his nickname that...  Okay.  Yep.  All right.  Sam will do a half hour of new nicknames for Dennis Falcone.  Oh, yeah.  Let's spend the post show today.  It can be great.  Yeah.  You should do that.  Dennis will be happy.  All right.  Why don't we go home? 
[03:06:30]  Anybody have anything?  We're all good?  I have a plug.  I don't even know how to take a try.  They might be good.  July 26th, midnight Montreal Festival, the Gisu Theater.  And then the 24th, I'm doing a keynote speech at 1.  A lot of festival people buy a pass for the whole thing, though.  Oh, do they?  Yeah, festivals are weird.  I got to apologize to Don LeWickline, because he's very mad because my chair is broken.  He's mad at me because my chair is broken.  Why is he mad at you? 
[03:07:00]  Who told you he's mad at you?  He gave me the finger as he walked by the studio.  Oh, shit.  That means he's mad at me because...  Maybe he's making an offer.  Because my chair is broken.  What if he was flipping off the chair?  Why are you holding back the who, kid, after we're done?  I don't even know he was here.  I've noticed lately.  You're holding him back.  That's him.  All of a sudden we go back, all of a sudden we go in the car, and all of a sudden there's  a whole crew in here.  Who cares?  A whole crew?  People like to hang out with me.  You're holding him back, though.  Nicole, we haven't even talked to Nicole since she had a kid.  Because I created an environment that's warm and welcoming. 
[03:07:30]  Come on in, who, kid.  See, look.  You were holding him back, but I was able to fucking get him in here.  You guys create a war zone.  Who, kid.  Look at Mr. New York Times.  That is a sweet shirt.  He's going to leave it for a hotel mate.  What's that, fucking Tupac?  Hey, who, kid?  So, this morning I'm getting ready for the show, and I always check your Instagram  because it is one of the better ones out there.  The Shaq thing.  Is that new?  No, that was like...  Oh, you just reposted it or whatever? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, that was like a couple of months ago.  What was it?  Okay.  He's playing 101 with Shaq on his Instagram.  It looked like I ran into a wall.  Where were you guys?  We were at some gym randomly in Brooklyn somewhere.  What was the score?  And he stole my...  You happened to be...  It was zip zip because we were doing the shootout.  Did you guys go there together or he just happened to be there the same time you were?  He was there before me, and then I was with some WBH.  WNBA?  Yeah, yeah.  Some chick I was trying to smash. 
[03:08:30]  Wow.  But they're all lesbians.  This one is partially a lesbian.  Oh, okay.  Did you fuck her?  Nah, I didn't fuck her because the pussy was too tall.  That's what I heard.  I don't know.  I didn't go through it.  Yeah, but it was kind of weird that I couldn't really dunk on him, and he smashed me.  It looked like I ran into a wall.  His arm is as big as my body.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't dunk.  Nah, I couldn't dunk.  Okay, all right.  I played a clay out of that.  There's no way you can dunk.  But Shaq really... 
[03:09:00]  I don't know, man.  His feet is like size 16 or something.  Is he 22 or something?  He's giant.  He was in here once.  It is unbelievable how big he is.  We've seen taller guys in the studio, but he is so fucking big.  His hand is like the size of my chest.  Right.  Yeah.  The tallest guy we've had in here was 7'8".  He was one of those two Globetrotters.  One of the Globetrotters.  7'8 or 7'9.  Those are real basketball players?  Crazy.  Wow.  I thought they were like circus acts.  Pretty much.  Because if you're 7'8 or 7'9 and you're with the Harlem Globetrotters instead of the NBA, 
[03:09:30]  this is what's wrong with your playing.  I thought it was a circus act.  Look at his fucking hands.  You make way more money in the NBA.  Look at his hand.  Look at his fingers.  It's bigger than his head.  That's unbelievable.  Can you imagine a finger in a girl's ass?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  She'd be hurting.  Holy shit.  That would be some pain.  He's got 11 penises.  He could rest his regular penis and use any one of those fingers and that would be as big  as most of our penises.  He could put all our business for us. 
[03:10:00]  They all have codes and everything, too.  She walked by like, no, I'm just walking by.  But she saw that we were still in here, so she's going to do a circle and then come back  when we're not here.  Your vibe isn't cool.  We understand what's going on.  You've got to have a cool vibe.  Then what about you?  My vibe is the coolest ever.  You don't have a cool vibe.  Do I have a cool vibe?  It's all right.  See?  You're a cute vibe.  Who kid thinks I'm cute?  I mean, you're not a homo.  You're not a homo.  I get what you mean.  You're not going to start making out with him, putting cake in his face, are you? 
[03:10:30]  No, that mo.  There we go.  Nicole.  Hey, Nicole.  God damn, you got everything back together.  I don't know how she did it.  Holy fuck, she got it all back together.  Yeah, you can sit right here, baby.  On your lap?  No, I'm good.  You can sit right here.  How many months now?  Well, the baby will be two months.  You got it all back together in two months.  I lost all the weight in like two weeks.  Wow.  It just fell off.  Good for you.  Now I've got to tighten it up.  Cocaine diet?  No.  Are you back on the drugs?  No. 
[03:11:00]  Boozing.  On the booze?  What?  I'm not back on anything.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Breastfeeding.  I was for a little while, then I stopped because that shit sucks and hurts and is miserable.  I didn't like it.  I did it for like a month.  I wasn't producing enough milk.  My nipples were killing me.  I don't like my nipples to be touched during sex anyways, let alone be sucked on by a baby  really hard.  Are they big or small?  What about middle-aged men?  Are they really?  Dark or light?  Yeah, they're dark.  Are they really big, dark nipples?  Oh, you got the big, dark ones?  Yeah.  How about the areolas?  Okay, really?  But did they get darker? 
[03:11:30]  No.  Someone said that.  Someone said, are they barky?  And I was like, what are you talking about?  Barky.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Girls' nipples get darker during...  Barky.  Do you have the slow fade or is it just one big fucking gravy stain?  No, there's no slow fade.  I don't think there's a slow fade.  It's just a gravy stain in the middle of your breast?  I just looked at Sam like he was doing that.  You're so observant.  Is the areola big?  The areola's pretty...  It's larger than...  Yeah, it's larger.  I like that a lot.  You do.  Yeah.  You got a lot of bumps around it?  No.  Those bumps.  Those bumps hate that.  That's the disgusting thing.  So the nipples are long? 
[03:12:00]  They're not long.  I mean...  You got big eraser nipples?  No, I do not have big eraser nipples.  Do you have a fucking suit on them?  No!  That's nice, though.  How'd the gash hold up?  It is good.  Actually, Matt told me he thinks it looks better than it did before.  She sewed it up nice and tight.  She didn't rip me that bad.  Oh, wow.  Yeah?  Did you rip all the way to your asshole?  No, I did not.  Just a tiny little rip.  Wow, they rip right through the...  What's it called?  Right through the asshole sometimes.  Whatever it is.  Still look like Rocky's eye.  He said it looks really good, and he's really happy with our doctor.  He wants to call and thank her. 
[03:12:30]  Damn!  Yeah.  I'm telling you, that's a myth.  It hurts a lot, though.  Yeah, I'm a little bit of trouble.  What?  I haven't said that.  It hurts a lot, though.  What do you mean?  It takes a little while for you to be able to do it again, like normally, right?  Oh, didn't you like...  Takes a while.  Yeah.  I did it right a little bit.  I feel like a virgin.  My kid is 14 and 13, though.  I did it right after.  I hear you won't take it up the ass.  Never.  Never.  I've tried it.  It just hurts.  More importantly...  It hurts.  I want an honest answer.  Does Sam Roberts tell you to come by here right at 1030 when we leave? 
[03:13:00]  No.  He's holding you guys back.  No.  Because we like doing radio with you two as well.  Yeah, but I told him that these guys are not welcoming.  They don't have a cool vibe.  And so you don't stop by.  I get to the car and all of a sudden there's a whole radio show in here.  I just don't want to bother you.  Like, we leave it.  Sam is all alone.  And then next thing you know, there's all these people in here.  I don't want to violate your mojo.  Right?  Your moisture.  That guy's got radio moisture.  You guys don't have a welcoming vibe at all.  Fuck you, Sam.  We do.  That's right. 
[03:13:30]  Sam says stop by anytime.  Sometimes I look over and he's got this warm smile like, come on in.  Cute shit.  It's safe in here.  Have the nips gone south of the hemisphere?  No, my nips are still okay.  They're not.  Are they African?  I just told you, I don't want them like going into the southern hemisphere.  I mean, I'm going to have to get them done eventually, but I'll wait until the next  kid.  Yeah, but they held up good.  They're okay.  Are they still engorged because they have milk in them?  No, their milk is gone.  One good thing is the baby's not black, so that gets me out of it. 
[03:14:00]  My baby's like so fair.  Like, I feel like I'm going to look like for real, like the nanny, like the summer, because  I get super dark in the summer, and she's super fair.  Yeah.  She's like Jimmy a little bit.  You got a cute kid there, Al.  Thank you very much.  So do you.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  I mean, it's not business.  I do get around, as they say.  Oh, jeez.  Jesus.  I dip it in a lot of Sirius XM hole.  Wow.  Walked right into that one.  Yeah, yeah.  You backed into it.  Oops.  I got to go.  Oh.  It's time for you guys to give me. 
[03:14:30]  Congratulations.  Yes, we're very happy for you.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  I missed you.  Who's your dog?  My dog's home.  I can't bring him in the way I brought in my old dog.  Why?  Because he's a maniac, and Phoebe was kind of like a cat.  What happened to Phoebe?  Jesus, Jimmy.  I swear to God, I don't know.  Oh, my God.  She might have given her away?  She got killed by a coyote last year.  Oh, my God.  I actually did not know that.  That's horrible.  You didn't know my dog was murdered viciously in the woods in New Jersey? 
[03:15:00]  No.  But someone was telling us last week there's no coyotes.  That's such a thing as coyotes.  Well, something fucked her up.  That.  Did you?  Was she dead when you found her or alive?  I didn't find her.  My friend found her.  Okay.  I don't want to talk about it.  I have to go.  Wait a minute.  Well, was she alive or dead when she found her?  She was dead.  Do you cry?  That's terrific.  Do you cry watching Roadrunner now?  Oh, my God.  Is it terrible?  Do you watch Old Yeller?  It's good to see you.  I'm a Roadrunner.  Let's watch Marley and me.  That coyote really is a crazy clown. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, shit.  When will you learn that he shouldn't?  See, we're very nice.  Is that it?  We're very nice.  That went well.  That was very nice.  You said it was good?  Who, kid?  We said how cute her baby was.  We were gentlemen there.  Well, I asked about the dog not knowing that she had neglected it and it had been killed.  She had neglected it.  I like the fact that you congratulated her for not looking ugly.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  That's very nice.  Gentleman. 
[03:16:00]  Because usually when you're pregnant, you give birth.  You look like shit.  And by the way, the reason...  If women do the right thing, everything comes back together nice.  You missed who, kid?  He said that he had sex.  She got her shit back together nice.  He had sex right after his kids were born, but that was because it was with different women.  Oh, right.  That's a whole different thing.  That's totally different.  It wasn't with your wife.  Yeah.  You're not very faithful.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  You know.  Or as I read in the newspaper, you're a estranged wife.  Yeah, you know, you know, nigga.  New York Times.  I saw the New York Times.  Big article on Who Kid in the New York Times. 
[03:16:30]  You had to make sure the hoes knew that she was estranged, right?  Pretty righteous.  Put estranged in there.  I got to keep my hoes in check.  Your wife was like, why is she estranged?  Did you see Fitty's tweet?  They follow me.  Did you see Fitty's tweet about being his grandma?  Oh, yeah.  His grandma asked him to take out the garbage, and he's like, I'm fucking rich.  I don't need this shit.  I'm leaving.  He told his grandma to go fuck herself.  It's crazy.  Happy Mommy Day.  That's vitamin water money. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  The Jay-Z thing is unreal.  I was just going to ask you about it.  What do you think that is?  I think it's probably Rihanna.  I think he probably smashed Rihanna one more time.  Why?  But then why is Beyonce just standing there, though?  Because she's in shock.  Do you think he banged Rihanna?  Probably.  I don't know.  Wouldn't you have?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I would have punched her, though.  You wouldn't have said that shit.  It was three hard kicks.  Come on.  You would have punched Solange, you're saying.  Yeah.  Solange. 
[03:17:30]  Three hard kicks, yo.  She was.  She was going at it.  Hands, feet, everything.  What would you do in that situation?  I would be running for my life.  When you'd decide your life was threatened.  Yeah, I'd pull out and fire a few.  You wouldn't do that in gym?  I don't know.  If she did that, it would probably be hard not to strike back.
