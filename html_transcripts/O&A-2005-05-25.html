<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from Washington, D.C., began with Opie detailing his comedically frustrating attempts to navigate the city's streets and find the XM studio.  He recounted getting lost, nearly encountering what he believed to be a police stakeout under a bridge, and previously driving the Beltway in a complete circle.  His difficulties were compounded by the less-than-ideal hotel location. Studio technician Steve assisted with directions. The hosts then transitioned to listener calls focusing on a successful coordinated "attack" on Todd Schnitt's Tampa radio show, orchestrated by the Opie and Anthony "Army."  Schnitt had previously criticized the show, prompting the listener backlash.  The hosts recounted a frustrated phone call with their agent, Bob Eatman, regarding Schnitt's complaints.  Numerous callers described their participation in the prank calls, using humorous pseudonyms and tactics.  The segment featured frequent offensive language and crude humor.

The show then received numerous calls from Canadian listeners, many illegally accessing the broadcast and expressing their fondness for the show while simultaneously expressing their dislike for Montreal.  The hosts engaged in humorous, frequently offensive, banter with callers, targeting Canadians, Montrealers (particularly French Canadians), and Newfoundlanders with numerous "Newfie jokes."  Regional rivalries within Canada were discussed, with callers from various provinces expressing contempt for Montreal.  Canadian and American broadcasting regulations were also compared. One caller even mentioned seeing the Opie and Anthony show name on a computer screen during an episode of *Deadliest Catch*.  Upcoming guest Mario Cantone was mentioned.  XM employee Dee Dee delivered a news report, frequently interrupted by the hosts' ribald commentary. Dee Dee also shared personal anecdotes, including alcohol-fueled blackouts and a check fraud incident.  The Michael Jackson trial was discussed, providing further opportunities for jokes.  More calls followed, including additional Newfie jokes and off-color discussions.  A running gag involved the hosts attempting to make Dee Dee correctly pronounce "stings." The show promoted their "Wow" sticker campaign and ended the segment by setting up Dee Dee's upcoming spanking.


The next segment included a conversation with Sari, an XM employee from the '70s channel, about a 4 million subscriber celebration featuring a countdown of the top 70-selling albums of the 1970s.  A playful guessing game ensued, with the correct answers eventually revealed.  Other XM channels (60s, 50s, and 40s) and various artists like Peter Frampton, Howlin' Wolf, Boston, and the Beatles were mentioned.  The hosts teased Sari and Dee Dee, who contributed more news stories. Sari recounted meeting Donny Osmond and having her childhood Donny Osmond doll signed.  The hosts repeatedly joked about the Mad Mexican and his dog, Chicago. Dee Dee's news segment included stories about a convicted murderer's execution request to donate his liver and a Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. commercial deemed "softcore porn" by the Parents Television Council.  Listener-submitted remixes of “Psycho Ex-Girlfriend” phone calls were played. Opie ripped up an autographed photo of the Mad Mexican and Chicago.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Opie's unusual toilet-paper hygiene habits.


A caller, Jimmy, then recounted a graphic sexual encounter with a woman he met at the gym, detailing explicit sexual acts in the locker room and shower. The conversation became increasingly vulgar.  Female caller Beth then joined, sharing details about her sexual preferences and body type before engaging in sexually suggestive banter with the hosts, leading to an interrupted attempt at phone sex.  Dee Dee entered the studio during this interaction.  The focus shifted to a previous "assault on the media" incident where an intern held up a sign behind a news reporter during a live broadcast, resulting in the reporter's angry, profane outburst and subsequent firing.  Audio clips from Alan Sniffen, a radio commentator and dentist who criticized Opie and Anthony, were played.  Opie and Anthony defended their actions, arguing the reporter was responsible. A Penthouse photographer was present in the studio.  Sexually suggestive comments and vulgar language continued. The segment ended with Opie and Anthony reiterating their intention to continue their "assaults on the media."


The final segment started with a discussion about a former associate, Alan,  and their differing opinions but acknowledging Alan's fairness during their firing. Opie then delivered a violent, hateful message directed at a message board user named Josh.  A Gamefly.com commercial aired.  A prolonged, repetitive segment followed centered around "Whip them out Wednesday," seemingly involving images of women's breasts.  American Idol was briefly discussed, with Opie sharing his strong opinions on Bo Bice and Carrie Underwood, noting their publication in the New York Post alongside Jay Thomas and Mickey Dolenz.  Opie's fixation on American Idol was emphasized.  The latter half focused on Dee Dee delivering news updates while being spanked by Jimmy. News items included the sale of Ozzy Osbourne's mansion, a high school Playboy-themed party, a new drug delaying male orgasms, a police sex sting, and a Darth Vader-masked theatre robbery. Dee Dee's discomfort and the increasingly rough spanking were explicit. The segment concluded amidst the spanking, with continued banter and sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  No, baby.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  We will be an end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:04:30]  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  He was banging cocktail wagonses two at a time.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared of you.  People keep your hands off of my meal.  You're just a tool.  It's over, Johnny. 
[00:05:00]  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  I'm looking at Jimmy.  He looks like he already has a problem.  Yeah.  I see you rolling your eyes, man.  How you doing, Jimmy?  I guess I got asked a question.  Is there a problem, Jimmy?  No, no.  I just want to make sure that the studio is painted and everything.  You know, because it makes the radio show a little bit better when things look better.  Aesthetics.  Aesthetics.  I can't hear me very well.  But everybody else is booming loud. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, really?  Me and my headphones, it's not very loud at all.  You got some headphone volume over there?  I don't want to crank it up because everybody else is perfect.  Oh, I gotcha.  My ears will be bleeding.  But me, I feel like I'm not really hearing me very well.  But, eh, that's how it goes in the big city.  Yeah, we're down here in Washington, D.C.  at the XM compound.  The compound.  And Jimmy is kind of bothered.  Yeah, because I stand.  People can't see. 
[00:06:00]  I usually do it.  I move the mic sometimes just because I'm not in one position.  And I have to do the...  That won't bother me.  Believe me, I'll do the whole show.  Not to be a dick, but because that's the way I do it.  But I'm like, maybe we can grease that.  And they're like, nah, we're not allowed to because aesthetically it doesn't look good.  Right, the grease is kind of a white, it's a white grease.  Yeah.  And these are black mic booms.  Right.  And if you put the white grease on there, it doesn't look good.  Right.  So aesthetically, they would not like the white grease on there.  So what you get is... 
[00:06:30]  Let's all do it.  As long as we look good, that's all that matters.  So every time we move the door, the mic stand, we get a creaky door sound.  Right.  All right.  I'll put mine there and leave it there.  It's going to be a problem for Jimmy because Jimmy, you know, he's a stand-up comic and  he wants to be moving around and doing his thing.  He moves around a lot.  With his microphone.  Yes, he does.  All right.  But we are here down in Washington, D.C.  Yes.  And we have so much to do, I don't even know where to begin. 
[00:07:00]  We have a lot of sound for the show today.  Yeah.  A lot of cool little stories.  We have...  We've got Steve here with us.  Hi, Steve.  Hi.  Steve C.  Is that the shirt you wore to court?  Yeah.  Whoops.  Sorry.  Yeah, this is the freak shirt I wore to court.  The one that did not get me out of jury duty.  No, it did get you out of jury duty.  Well, the shirt didn't.  The fact that I worked for you guys got me out of jury duty.  That'll do it.  That's worse than a really bad shirt.  It really is.  I was trying not to pull that out because you never know how people are going to react. 
[00:07:30]  But it was like, ah, here it comes.  Yeah.  I'm so jealous.  Everyone is booming in the headphones.  Except me.  I'm like low-volume guy.  Really?  Yeah.  Feels weird.  Feels like I've got to do this.  No, you don't have to.  Hey, everybody!  You don't have to.  It's odd.  I want to thank Steve for getting me to the hotel.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Pretty much when we last left you, we did a radio show in New York and we all went our  separate ways.  That's it.  You drove down, I drove down, Jimmy took the train with Steve, and man, my directions were 
[00:08:00]  perfect for MapQuest and then I wasn't paying attention for the last, I don't know, mile  or two.  Oh, boy.  And I got off at the wrong exit.  And then at one point, I'm under a bridge somewhere near a river.  Uh-oh.  And I think there was a drug deal going down.  I'm like, I think I'm lost.  There's a few bad areas you want to steer clear of in D.C.  Yeah.  Like D.C.  Yeah.  And we're north of Virginia.  Anywhere north of Virginia, that's why. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I'm not kidding, though.  I was under a bridge.  There were some scary looking people down there.  And then I think there were some, you know, then there were cops down there just kind  of, I don't know, doing a, what do they call it there, a, where they look at you and  eat sandwiches.  What do they call that?  You know, like they just stare in an apartment and they just sit in an unmarked car and they  eat sandwiches.  Oh, a steakhouse.  Yeah.  And they just eat sandwiches until the relief team comes and brings them donuts and coffee. 
[00:09:00]  I think I was in a, in the middle of something.  Yeah.  Because I went up to this unmarked car and asked for directions.  And it was almost like I was blowing up this guy's spot.  Like, Jesus, will you get the hell out of here?  And I'm like, but I'm lost.  You asked for directions?  Yeah.  I was under a bridge.  And then there was this one car with scary characters doing something over there.  And then there was this unmarked car that looked like they were looking at the, the other car  with the scary characters.  You're crazy. 
[00:09:30]  But I was lost.  So I, I drive up like, hi officer.  How are you?  Hello.  And he's on a phone.  The other guy, I think he has binoculars.  I mean, there was a whole thing going on.  Something going down.  Something was going down.  And I need to know how to get back on 395 or whatever it was.  And you're ruining it.  I ruined the whole fucking thing.  It really took you a long time though.  Yeah.  I was, I was about two miles from the hotel at 430 and I was in the lobby at six o'clock.  They had streets, you know, blocked off everywhere when I finally got back into the normal, I don't 
[00:10:00]  know, everyday driving that people do there.  And I don't know what was going on.  And then every road I, I wanted to turn down was a one way going the way I, wrong way.  Yeah, exactly.  So I, I, I know once I was driving around in DC and I had Jimmy in the car and I was lost.  We were talking about that at dinner last night.  Jimmy saw what, what it's like to be with me when I'm lost.  You got to explain it for everybody.  You did.  What is that road called?  It's one big circle. 
[00:10:30]  The belt or something.  The belt.  The what?  Around the beltway?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The beltway.  The beltway.  You, Anthony took the beltway completely, entirely, all the way around.  All the way around.  To where I made a complete circle.  Complete circle.  On the beltway.  And it's about a hundred mile circle, I think.  Oh, dude.  It's insane.  What, 55?  55.  55 mile circle.  I drove 55 miles.  To get back where you were.  To get right back where I was.  Screaming.  Just a mad person. 
[00:11:00]  I was insane.  And Jimmy, he's in the car.  I think it's the first time you were ever driving with me.  And the last.  Yeah.  Hadn't been a lot of trips since then, either.  No.  And I was just losing my mind.  That was a couple of years back now.  Yeah.  Now, I made it in four hours.  12.30.  4.30.  I was pulling right up to the hotel.  Courtesy of the fantastic invention, the navigation system, Opie.  You really should look into a vehicle with it.  I had my own navigation system. 
[00:11:30]  Steve and a MapQuest?  Yeah, you're looking at him right there.  Steve.  Yeah.  It was.  You can always tell when it's going to be one of those calls from Opie because you get  the frantic, I don't know where the fuck I am, call.  And I'm like, oh, this is going to be a long one.  But that's more like a Jimmy thing.  But you're right.  I go down that road, too.  But I'll think your MapQuest had better diction than Ants did.  Yes, I had to.  I had to.  The next right.  What is this fucking machine?  Excuse me? 
[00:12:00]  What are you talking about?  I had to.  I'm like, Steve, get on Google for me or MapQuest or whatever.  And then he was getting me to the hotel.  Giving turn-by-turn directions.  I was on a Google Maps.  They do this thing where you can zoom in and look at specific streets.  And as he's driving up of whatever street it was, I'm telling him, okay, take the next  right that'll take you right to the hotel.  I can't fucking go there.  It's blocked off.  It's blocked off or it's one way or the wrong way for me.  And then the funny thing is, because it is Washington, and we all do the cell phone 
[00:12:30]  thing.  Who the fuck cares?  You need handheld devices.  Screw that.  We all just use our cell phones, right?  And I'm trying to get to the hotel, and I go, ah, Steve, shit, cop.  Yeah.  And then I, you know, drive past that cop, and I pick up the phone again and go, cop!  Cop!  Cop!  Cop!  Every block, cop.  Because it's Washington, D.C.  Opie.  Yeah.  You know what you do?  So then finally I went speakerphone, had the cell phone on my lap, and I'm talking to 
[00:13:00]  Steve, and he got me in.  You know what you do?  Huh?  You press a button on your rear view mirror and go, call, number, Opie, calling, Opie.  And then it calls, and you just got to talk.  You don't need a phone or nothing.  It's right there in your vehicle.  That must be nice.  And your navigation tells you where to go?  It's wonderful.  I got Steve.  You really have to... 
[00:13:30]  I got Steve and a cell phone on my knee.  You maybe have to upgrade.  Steve and a cell phone on your knee.  God forbid I wasn't there.  And coffee in my left hand.  You know, the whole deal.  We're living different lives, my friend.  And so I pull up at 6 o'clock.  That's just as good as pulling up at 4.30 and relaxing.  Of course.  6 o'clock and wheel in.  And enjoying the fine room that they give us here in D.C.  Yes.  Oh, no.  It was check in, quickly shower, go eat dinner. 
[00:14:00]  And then you got lost walking back from the restaurant?  Yeah.  And then Jimmy and I, we were probably three blocks from the hotel.  It took us about a half hour to walk back home.  And we ended up, I don't know, on the other side of the hotel somehow.  Really?  I have no idea what we did.  Yeah, I had a piss desperately.  And we're just taking a...  He likes to walk everywhere.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Oh, I know.  It's like, you know, it's just a couple of blocks.  Take a walk.  And before you know it, you've walked like five, eight miles.  Yeah.  You're still going.  You're still not even close to where you got to be. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  In cities that I'm not familiar with, you know, I don't want to walk.  Sometimes it's hard to get a cab.  So from like the station to maybe Caroline's, walk down into Times Square.  You know, that for me is like, that's kind of a long walk, but it's doable.  It'll be in some city we've never been to.  Dude, let's just take a walk.  I hear it's down here.  And you're walking like eight miles.  You want to explore a little bit.  No.  No?  No, I don't.  All right.  Let's...  Let me see.  I want the parking garage. 
[00:15:00]  I want my room.  I want room service.  I want movies on demand.  And I want a computer in the room.  Oh, this is working actually.  Really cool.  Rough Rider, what's up?  Hey, I want to know when you guys were getting lost out there, was it a case of where three  rights made a left?  Actually, I think I did the whole three rights make a left to get to the hotel.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And then when you pulled up to the car there, guy, and asked him, rolled the window down,  did you say, hey, man, which way is north? 
[00:15:30]  Which way is north?  Very nice.  Thanks, Rough Rider.  All right.  It was definitely scary down under that bridge.  Let's say hi to Mike, who's in Washington, D.C.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I grew up about 10 miles north of D.C.  And I won't go into D.C. exactly because of what you said.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  A little scary, some of the areas.  Well, you're trying to tell me I was near the river or something like that?  Yeah.  It sounds like you were right near the Anacostia River.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  That's bad, huh?  Well, the southeast side of D.C. is the bad side over on that side.  But where your studios are, that's not too bad where you guys are.  Yeah.  It was like a dirt road under a bridge near a river, and there was some kind of, I'm  telling you, there was some kind of stakeout.  Something was going down.  And I just pull up in my stupid vehicle, hey, officer, officer, meep, meep.  You, you, the cops.  The cops.  Why are you paying attention to me?  You're supposed to protect and serve.  I want to thank the fine gang at Zipcar for getting us to the XM compound this morning. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, we didn't have to take the XM Opie and Anthony clown van.  Oh, I hate that thing.  Where is it?  I didn't even see it in the parking lot.  That means they've painted over our faces.  Is that the Major League Baseball van I saw?  I believe.  Come on.  Suddenly, I saw your face shining through a baseball on the side.  Is that Opie's face on it?  Who's going to be the one that's brave enough to tell us that our van no longer exists and  that there's a new logo on it?  Look at everyone looking down, like, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[00:17:00]  Because I got a Zipcar to pick you up.  Yeah, I didn't see the van anywhere, and the Zipcar shows up.  Yeah.  And they're like, no, this is much better, and it's great.  And I'm thinking, hmm, what's going on here?  That's odd.  Where's the stupid van?  Well, we're always mocking the van anyway.  I hated getting in it.  Like, it would pull up to pick us up, and people would look at it because it's just the  most ridiculous cartoony thing.  And then they'd see us on it and see us getting in it.  And then you've got to acknowledge, like, yeah, yeah, pointing at it and laughing, all 
[00:17:30]  embarrassed, jumping in.  He did that thing.  And no, uh, no shootings today from the hotel to the XM compound like last time we were here.  None we saw.  I don't know, I don't know which way they take to drive us here in the morning from the hotel.  Why?  Well, one thing I noticed from my navigation system, oh, as I'm driving, I said, oh, there's 
[00:18:00]  XM right there.  Because I don't know what's anywhere.  You know, I'm just driving how it tells me.  And there's a video screen with the map scrolling, my position, and everything.  So I'm driving, and I see the XM compound off to my right.  And I go, oh, that's XM right there.  So I look down at my nav system, and my destination is 1.8 miles away.  1.8 miles away. 
[00:18:30]  Megan's eyes just got real wide in the other studio, like, oops.  And the traffic circle that we get off, that the hotel is pretty much on that traffic circle,  is on the same road that I passed.  Not one turn did I have to take from the time I passed XM to the time I got to the traffic  circle.  You don't know?  So why do we have to go?  It takes us 15 minutes to get here in the morning.  And we have to go.  And we're taking turns.  We have to go through the burnt-out section of the ghetto.  Oh, there's awful neighborhoods.  Megan, I have no idea where you're driving. 
[00:19:00]  I was stunned when I looked down and saw 1.8 miles away.  That's even a walk for me.  Yeah, I was going to say, that's just a little stroll for me.  That's a stroll.  That's like getting the morning papers.  Rob in D.C., what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Pretty good.  Hey, man, I worked on your building there, an acting place,  when I was, like, three or four or five years ago, I was drilling holes, core drilling.  If we didn't get inside the security compound the minute it opened, man,  we had to park on the street.  They broke into our van every day. 
[00:19:30]  We used to leave the shit unlocked and put, like, fake shit in there.  They'd still punch out the windows, break out the locks, steal everything in there.  It drove us nuts.  That is a shitty neighborhood.  Yeah, I mean, this guy ain't lying, man.  I mean, I hope you guys understand.  This place is in a horrendous neighborhood.  It's like a fort.  It is a fort, though.  It's like a fortress.  That's the beauty of it.  It is a fort.  You know there's a problem when the directions said they got left at Hotel Rwanda.  That's what it feels like.  Hotel Rwanda. 
[00:20:00]  There's refugees coming in, trying to get away.  Some safety.  You're going to throw a bag of ice out the car.  There are streets that you drive down, and people just park in the middle of the street.  They don't care.  Yeah.  They're blocking it up and everything.  For what reason, I don't know.  When the traffic report has to tell you to divert traffic because of machete attacks,  you know there could be a problem.  You're going to make a right at the pile of sugar cane.  Jesus. 
[00:20:30]  Let's say hi to Ciro.  Ciro, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Morning, Ciro.  Yeah, one time we had to go to this conference down in D.C., and my cousin worked for the  organization that was hosting it.  So he's like, oh, I'll book the rooms for you.  So he booked the rooms for me and my two friends, and he gave us directions there, and  we're driving around.  We're like, where the fuck are we?  It's like so scary.  And then we get to the hotel, and we're like sleeping that night, and all of a sudden we  hear this guy screaming outside the room, oh, God, oh, God. 
[00:21:00]  And we hear smashing against the walls outside, and my friend wanted to look outside and help  the guy.  I said, what are you, nuts?  I said, just stay in the room.  And the next morning we asked what happened, and she's like, oh, the guy had food poisoning.  I'm like, yeah, all right.  Then we go visit my cousin where he was, and he was in this posh hotel in, like, downtown  Washington, D.C.  And we're like, you motherfucker, you put yourself up in the nicest place in D.C., and  you put us in the shittiest place in D.C.  But why didn't he put you?  Oh, shut up. 
[00:21:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  No, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Thank you so much for the story, Syro.  That's weird, though, right?  He didn't put you in the good hotel either.  Shut up, Jimmy.  And he was in a lousy hotel.  Dude, so what happened?  Was the guy really food poisoning or no?  Trying to think of how he can make that into 13 episodes.  That's a heck of a show.  Cool.  Yeah, all right.  Well, there you have it.  Local station ripping off $100,000.  What is that about?  G100, I heard.  What? 
[00:22:00]  He doesn't know.  I did G100.  Tim in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Last night, listening to G100 in New York, and they did the wackiest thing around.  They gave away $100,000, and it turned out to actually be a candy bar.  Wow.  They didn't do that, did they?  We're going to think about doing something like that someday.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, man.  Thanks, Tim.  Punching out.  Well, do we care?  I don't know.  We did that in Boston years ago. 
[00:22:30]  Tell them, Opie.  Dave?  Dave in Philly, what's up?  So, you guys talking just shit on blacks and stuff.  This is fucked up, man.  I think y'all just being racist just for the shock value.  I just tuned in today.  I just don't get what all this is about, you know what I'm saying?  What did we say that was racist, by the way?  First of all.  Sugar Cane?  What the fuck?  Who's the dude that said that?  I did.  Jim Norton.  Who's the dude?  Vincent Hurst? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, listen to this, phony.  Shut up.  This is the worst impression I've ever heard.  Yeah, I'm hanging up on it.  I mean, we don't go with the callers that say, hey, I just started listening only five  minutes ago.  I just started listening.  Yeah.  He's trying.  I'm not stolen XM.  Shut up, stupid.  Oh, boy.  Here come the calls from Boston.  They want in.  Go ahead, Jack.  Hey, I wanted to ask Opie if him getting lost in D.C. was like Black Hawk Down while  the street's Black Hawk Down.  Trying to get the convoy through? 
[00:23:30]  Thank you, Boston.  Boston never disappoints, I'll tell you.  Here's a guy from Detroit that has a D.C. experience.  Really?  Detroit isn't much better.  Mark, what's up?  Not much, man.  But, you know, I started driving a truck seven years ago, and it took me two years to get  to D.C. And the first time I got there, there's no truck stops to speak of there, but there 
[00:24:00]  was a Walmart store, and within 15 minutes of me parking in that Walmart parking lot,  I had one nigger trying to sell me dough.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  One nigger.  One nigger.  Where's my bell?  Where's my bell?  Hold on.  Dude, what did you have to go into Walmart for?  Antihistamines?  Oh, mighty.  What a congested-sounding ass.  Congested racist?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't want them in my...  Do you have a tissue?  I don't want them in my name. 
[00:24:30]  And then, you know, at the same time, when I pulled up to the diner by JFK Airport, and  then I ran in and told them, hey.  Great Bob Golub line.  That's right.  Let me ask you a question.  Does it sound like the mic's like...  Is this the different mic that we have in New York?  You sound great.  No, I mean, am I moving around too much?  I feel like I'm going in now, but that might be the way I'm moving.  No.  No, I think you're on the whole...  I think that mic needs to be taken to New York with us. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, I thought it sounded...  No, it sounds way better.  Okay.  Steal it.  Because when you do move around in New York, we lose you a little bit.  You're booming, Jimmy.  You're booming.  All right.  I forgot to tell you guys on the way down.  Phone rings.  It's our agent.  Super Agent Robert Eatman?  Super Agent Bob Eatman.  What did he want?  He didn't call me.  Well, I knew this was going to happen eventually.  I mean, Bob had a fine business before he signed UNI.  Yeah.  But it is a fact after UNI signed and made headlines and made some good deals. 
[00:25:30]  Kind of put him on the map?  Put him on the map, and a lot of people came to the table and want Super Agent Bob Eatman  to represent...  So who's going to be in our way next time we have to make a phone call and he's not available  because he's on the phone with this person?  Exactly.  So he calls me with a little problem that popped up, and I just freaking let him have  it like you wouldn't believe.  I'm like, I'm never, ever going to play this game with you.  Stop right now. 
[00:26:00]  So basically the phone call goes like this.  I answer and he goes, hey, one of my clients just called me and says that you're trashing,  you guys are trashing him, and this client wants to know, doesn't these guys know we  have the same agent?  What?  Who?  That Todd Schnitt.  He represents Schnitt?  He represents the schnitzter.  The schnitzter? 
[00:26:30]  The schnitzel?  Who used to be, I guess, like we learned yesterday, MJ from the old MJ and TJ or BJ or whatever  show there in Tampa.  I don't mind MJ, but I hate the schnitzter.  So basically what happened was, well, what I told Bob is, A, I'm not playing this game,  we'll go after whoever we want, I don't give a fuck who else you represent, and B, do you  realize that this guy, you know, trashed us to begin with?  We didn't start it, we didn't even know who Todd Schnitt was until yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, why would we even bash Todd Schnitt?  We were playing the audio of, you know, our assault on the media and how people were talking  about it, and one of the shows we played was the Todd Schnitt show.  And he was the one that was bashing us, so screw him.  Do I even have that down here?  I think I have it somewhere.  Just to get everyone on the same page here.  The Todd Schnitt show.  So basically what happened was, he trashed us a bit, he called us imbeciles or something  like that, which is fine, whatever. 
[00:27:30]  So we called in an attack on his show, remember, yesterday?  So I guess, because it was around 3.40, I guess the attack was in full force, and I  believe, you know, this is some info for the listeners, you did a great job, you got  under his skin, because I believe during his show, during a commercial break, he must have  taken a long commercial break to call Bob to ask Bob, you know, don't these guys know  that, you know, we're represented by the same guy.  Well, from the message board, I was reading some of the posts, apparently the attack went 
[00:28:00]  very well.  The screener for his show was going crazy.  They were pounding his phone lines.  At one point on his show, he said something like, wow, the phones are really lit up today.  Like, he's probably not used to getting a lot of calls, and they were just packed.  And the screener was really having a tough time, because they're pretty clever, the pests  are pests.  And they're pretty clever at getting through.  But they started really dumping out of every phone call. 
[00:28:30]  They wouldn't even let any phone calls on the air.  Are they dumping?  Well, they weren't dumping.  They were just disconnecting everybody that was on hold.  So it eliminated his phones from the show, which really, I guess, pissed them off if  you're a talk show that depends a lot on your phone calls.  But to use that tact, you know, you call our agent and say, don't these guys know we have  the same agent?  What are they doing?  Another pussy.  You know, he went on his show, he took some shots at us, and then we went right back  with our army of pests.  That's right.  Well, just in case you missed it yesterday, here's what Todd Schnitt had to say about us that 
[00:29:00]  started the whole thing.  Turns out, these were a bunch of goons.  I don't know whether they were employees or they were just, you know, unemployed Opie  and Anthony listeners.  But Opie and Anthony, the shock jock radio show, which used to be on the air in New York  City, until they got canned.  Because remember, Opie and Anthony, they were the imbeciles that had two listeners have  sex.  Imbeciles.  Imbeciles.  Call Bob.  Call Bob.  I don't want him calling me an imbecile. 
[00:29:30]  Did Bob ask for a receipt for a five-cent toll during your phone call?  Jesus Christ.  I think you billed me for the call.  He is so...  He is just the stereotypical Jew.  Oh my God.  But dude, it wasn't even open for discussion.  I just blasted him.  I'm like, we will never play this game.  You will never call Anthony and I and say, look, could you lay off Mancow or Todd Schnitt  or this guy?  Because, you know, I represent them too.  We will never play that game, ever. 
[00:30:00]  I got a receipt from a gumball machine.  The imbeciles that had two listeners have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Yeah, that's clever.  That goes just beyond any even acceptable form of shock jock radio.  Shock jockery.  It was a shock jock radio, a little shock, a little edginess.  That doesn't bother me at all.  Oh, you're right already.  We were off the air for two years because of it, you jackass.  Of course it wasn't acceptable.  We know.  We found out. 
[00:30:30]  We sat on our ass for two years because of it, you schnit.  You schnit head.  Oh, schnit head.  Look, I use his name like the word shit.  Only schnit.  That's funny.  I think this guy is full of schnit.  Oh, he's a schnit head.  Oh, look up.  All right, well, here, he does some more.  But having two listeners have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral, that's just over the top. 
[00:31:00]  And they were out of work for, what, a couple of years?  I think they were out for two years.  Then one of the satellite channels picked them up.  And I guess they're on a mission or they have a mission for listeners to harass television live shots.  Apparently, that's the deal.  So there were two guys who were holding up this Opie and Anthony radio sign behind this reporter.  The guy's name, Arthur Chien.  And Arthur was doing this report.  It was 6 a.m. 
[00:31:30]  It was like 6.01.  And the anchor at WCBS, Channel 2 in New York, goes to Arthur Chien.  And he's standing there, he's doing his little, his rap.  So I guess he's opening up the story live.  Then they're going to throw it to a recorded piece.  And then he'd come back and do the, and that's it from here, reporting live from some subway steps.  I'm Arthur Chien, Channel 2 News, or whatever the heck you would say.  But the guys behind him were holding up the sign. 
[00:32:00]  They were also, like, screaming the Opie and Anthony.  They also flicked off the camera right behind him.  He didn't even, like, wait, like, three seconds for them to cut to the package.  He just whips around.  He ends his sentence live on the air.  And was that, what, was that even a quarter of a second that he whips around and says,  What the bleep's your problem, man?  God fired.  So there you have it.  You know, he took his shots at us.  Yeah, he's been a smug douche. 
[00:32:30]  That's exactly what he was being.  So he was all cool on his show, took a few shots at us, and we fight back always.  God!  Schnit dick!  And obviously he couldn't take the attack that came his way because of what he had to say.  And he had to call our agent, like a little pussy.  Yeah.  And get Bob involved?  And Bob should know better.  Like, Bob is going to be able to talk to me or Anthony and make a stop ever?  No.  Doesn't work.  Bob?  Bob? 
[00:33:00]  Bob?  So I pretty much hung up on him.  I go, listen for yourself.  But the guy, you know, he attacked us first.  I didn't even know who Todd Schnit was and blah, blah, blah.  And obviously Bob never called back.  And how dangerous is it for Bob to call you while you're driving?  If you nod off, doze while you're talking to him?  Huh?  What?  Ah!  You can hit an abutment.  Yeah.  He really does have that smoke on the honeybees effect whenever he's getting...  They don't have Bob just talking to a hornet's nest. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, what a...  Oh, what a bore.  Jesus.  But this, Todd Schnit, what a pussy.  He called our agent.  That's like calling your dad, basically.  Especially after he started it.  I know.  Yeah, he started it.  The guy started, you want to play?  Fine.  We're always fine with it.  But this is what happens all the time with us.  Like, you know, Howard started some shit with Anthony and I, so we said, we ain't scared  of this fucking idiot.  So we had started attacking him big time, and he went and told our dad.  Our dad. 
[00:34:00]  Like, he ran and told dad to make us stop.  Instead of fighting his own battles.  You know, when the lights go down in the bedroom.  You know, he's in one bunk bed, and we're in...  Well, not we.  I'm in one, and then Anthony has the other bed across the room, and that's when you fight  your battles.  You don't go running into mom and dad's room and cry like a baby.  Don't make me come in there.  Right.  Oh, dad's mad.  Me and my brothers would settle all business when the lights went out.  Ooh.  When it was bedtime. 
[00:34:30]  Mom and dad watching laugh.  Mom in that Hughes bedroom.  Mom and dad watching laughing downstairs.  And all hell is breaking loose upstairs because of business we had to take care of.  That was it.  I remember pops coming in with a belt a few times.  You don't go running to dad to make your brother stop or what have you.  So.  But that made for an interesting ride to D.C.  Because then I was fuming after that.  I'm like, what is Bob doing?  I meant to call you right away, by the way, and I forgot.  I like when Bob pulls up and he starts talking. 
[00:35:00]  You get a little bored.  I just take a penny and throw it in the car, and he jumps back in the car.  It keeps him away from me.  Let's go to Doug Out Doug from Wackbag.com.  Doug?  Gentlemen, I would like to report that we did have some mild success yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  We got about three or four calls through.  But the best part of it is when we make them alter what they do on a daily basis.  I think that's more of a success than anything else.  Of course. 
[00:35:30]  They actually had to drop us three or four times after the calls started going through.  Then we dropped off on the success rate because they were taking phone numbers and calling the callers back.  Yeah, here's our pests.  Here's what they do.  They started saying, all right, we'll let you through, but give us your phone number and we'll call you back.  Now, the screener's got to deal with this.  You know, he's got to take numbers and call people back.  So our pests are like, hey, what could they possibly do?  Who cares if they have our phone number? 
[00:36:00]  It's not like he's going to put it out over the air or something.  So they were given the phone number.  Screw it.  They were threatening to put mine out over the air.  I kept giving it to the screener, too, because I was welcoming it because I really don't have much to do.  That would be funny, too, right?  Just take that.  I would have had my own little show.  But I wish, I tell you, I was going through a divorce the past year.  I was walking around with a tape recorder recording all my wife's phone calls for the past year.  I wish I had that damn thing yesterday.  I was on the phone with their screener for about 15 minutes, right around 4.30.  I was begging him, look, we took your show. 
[00:36:30]  We made a shit out of it today.  Put me on with him.  This guy says he's legit.  He says he's in your face.  Let him take me on.  Let's talk about what he was talking about with O&A.  They would not do it.  They were even during break, and he said, no, don't put him on the air.  I actually had the screener talking to him saying, all right, well, let's let this guy take it on.  They would not do it.  And they were also appreciating the XM satellite radio when they realized, 
[00:37:00]  because in order to do these assaults, obviously, you have to listen to the program that you're assaulting.  And all they were bitching about is, oh, my God, he talked for six minutes and went back into 20 minutes of commercials.  Apparently, the guy's show is all commercials.  Well, no, I think that's probably when he called Bob.  They probably got a whole bunch of commercials together, so he had some time to try to work out this problem.  I'm all right.  I told the guy, I said, look, you guys have more listeners today than you're ever going to have.  If you take this head on, you might actually get a little bit of legitimacy out of it. 
[00:37:30]  They would not do it.  He actually yelled from the background, I'm not giving them any more advertisements than I already have.  We got under his skin.  Just a little bit.  Doug, you rock.  Nice job, man.  Doug is like the commander of the Army, more or less.  Oh, yeah.  You really get into it when we call in an attack there, huh?  Oh, it was great.  I did.  I was actually at work while doing it, and people in the cubes around me were wondering what the hell was wrong with me.  Yeah, cool. 
[00:38:00]  Well, we got some examples we're going to play in a second here.  Hey, can we give a thanks to the new Army website, oarmy.com, and Sniper for setting that up?  Jesus, I've got to check out a new website, oarmy.com.  Yeah, you've got to check this out, because this is actually a central location,  but inside the central location, we have the ability to keep moving around to keep things mobile.  It really is ingenious.  They find the links to, so no matter where you are in the country, they find the links to the webcasts of these shows. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  So they put the link up.  That way, everybody from across the country can listen.  They post maps of the area around the broadcast area, so you can say that you're from whatever town,  so the guy doesn't know that you're from it.  It's amazing the organization that these pests have.  I love it.  By the way, I know what happened to the ONA van.  They're actually driving it around with a little hole drilled in the back,  and he's looking for a young Jamaican named Lee Malvo.  Suck your pants.  I was actually thinking, when they started picking and not taking calls from anybody that didn't have a Florida area code, 
[00:39:00]  that would be a great advertisement for Vonage.  You know, Vonage, you have the ability of having any phone number and area code.  Maybe we can set something up with them so we can all change our numbers all the time.  We finally found the angle with Vonage.  There it is.  We were trying to find an angle for that new sponsor, Vonage.  I'm here for you guys.  All right, Doug, thank you so much.  It's OAArmy.com, another website to add to your favorites, I guess.  Bunching out.  Bye, Mr. General. 
[00:39:30]  That's hilarious.  Let's go to Tom in Buffalo.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, you guys?  I called in yesterday to get on the old shit show there.  Shit show.  And being a truck driver, I can kind of get around that area code thing when I have a,  what do you bring up your number there?  So I tell him, I tell him, hey, I'm a truck driver and I got a legitimate pitch about, say,  parking on the ramps. 
[00:40:00]  You know, they were taking away all our parking.  Then they won't let us park on the ramps.  And the guy's listening to me, right?  I figured he was the screener.  I called in and said my handle was, what was opening there?  Or, excuse me, Anthony?  Wow.  You're falling apart, bro.  You're falling apart.  Wow, you are really losing it, sir.  You're falling apart.  Oh, shit.  Hey, punch it out.  See ya.  See?  That's a punch out.  I like that guy, though.  He reached between his legs, pulled the handle, popped the canopy. 
[00:40:30]  He's out.  He knows there'll be another time.  Both engines flamed out.  He was going down.  He knew how to save himself.  He saved himself.  And he knows he'll be back to call again.  Let's go to Steve in PA.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good, man.  It's Nelly.  Yeah, it was pretty funny yesterday.  I called these guys.  I was on the road when I was listening to this schnit head.  And I called, and I had no fucking idea what this guy was talking about, because I'm from  PA, and I'm not listening to his radio program. 
[00:41:00]  And I got the screen, and I was like, you know, I'm really fired up.  I really agree with what this guy's saying.  And I was like, you know, I really, I want to talk about it.  And the guy's like, yeah, okay, yeah, okay.  And he's all excited.  He's like, hold on.  Puts me on hold for a sec, comes back.  And I'm like, as soon as they put me through, I thought I had the show.  And I'm like, hey, schnit head.  Oh, hey, party rock.  And I can just hear this guy in the background, cut him off, cut him off.  And I called back, like, I just put my cell phone on speed dial, and I must have called 
[00:41:30]  the show, like, 15 times in less than a half hour.  Yeah, their phone was just plugged up.  And you could hear the, you know, the degrading of the show, because when the guy, if the screener  first picks up, he's like, hey, yeah, how can we help you?  What can we do for you?  By, like, the 10th time I got through, it was like, yeah.  What?  He was totally fucked.  He was pulling his hair out of his head.  Oh, that's awesome.  Oh, it was hysterical. 
[00:42:00]  Apparently, they were doing the filibuster story.  The guy was talking about that exciting filibuster story that Eric had brought to our attention  last week.  Maybe Eric should go work for the Todd Schnitz show.  I know.  So he's trying to get some phone calls about the whole filibuster thing.  And then all our pests are calling, and he goes, well, a lot of people are calling about  this filibuster thing.  No one's calling about the filibuster thing, ass. 
[00:42:30]  When you got to listen to his show?  No, I was reading the message board.  Oh, okay.  And reading, like, because they not only organize, but they post what topics the guy's talking  about, so that way you can call up with the proper topic.  They're very organized.  Someone brought up a great point.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  You guys are fucked when these psychos turn on you.  True.  They're just honing their skills.  True.  So true.  We're going to have to have a purge, I think.  We're going to have to lop the heads off the generals.  You ever see Willard?  Yeah.  That's just a rat. 
[00:43:00]  All the rats turn and eat them.  It seemed like a good idea at the time to have a few rats around, but every so often  we're going to need a push.  We're just going to need to lop the heads off the generals and promote some of the underlings.  So true, man.  So true.  Let's go to Fan Dick from whackbag.com.  Oh, Fan Dick.  Fan Dick.  What's up, boys?  No calls from OpieAnthony.net today, huh?  They get all upset if we don't mention them in the same breath as Whackbag.  What's up, Fan Dick?  Hey, what's going on, man? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I was the first one to get through yesterday, Chester from Fort Lauderdale.  Yes, Chester.  I hate that call.  We got your call, actually.  We're going to play that one.  Chester.  I love it.  Because you know right when it happens.  You just hear, let's go to Chester.  And you're like, oh, no.  Whenever there's a Chester or a Rudy, you know, there's a problem.  Connor.  Connor.  Scott from Modesto.  Let's listen to your call.  You stay right there, Fan Dick.  All right, man.  Folks, we want to respond to what I just talked about. 
[00:44:00]  Let's grab Chester in Fort Lauderdale on Schmidt.  Hi.  Hey, how you doing, man?  Yes, sir.  First off, I just want to say, great show.  Very insightful.  I want to thank you for it.  You bet.  Not you.  Don't kick me in the river, Opie.  You bad bird.  Don't kick me in the river.  Oh, hey, party rock.  What the heck is he mumbling about?  What's his problem?  Yeah, what the heck is he mumbling about?  And he said that rather clearly.  Holy Jesus.  That is a star.  Not you. 
[00:44:30]  Not you.  Another broadcaster that doesn't want to be honest.  He's going to make believe he doesn't know what that's about.  Oh, did he fall right into that.  Oh, thank you.  Not you.  You bet.  You douchebag.  What are you, a third grade teacher?  You bet.  You betcha.  I think you can call that one a bullseye, huh?  That was fantastic.  That was fantastic.  That might be the best one.  I think we should have ended with that one.  Well, no, there was a couple good ones, but I just got lucky.  It was the first caller, and the guy was totally not ready for it. 
[00:45:00]  He didn't, you know, he must not have known.  Yeah.  You get such a chill when you hear that.  Chester, let's go to Chester.  Oh, no.  No, don't go there.  Okay, go there.  No, don't.  Great job, FanDick.  The funniest part was the guy called me back at my house after I hung up the screener.  Yeah.  The guy sounds like he's on Valium or something.  He's like, oh, you know, you're not very funny, and we have your number now.  And I said, good.  Give it to all 300 of your listeners.  They can call me. 
[00:45:30]  They can call me more than your boy does.  Yeah, if their listeners start calling at home, make sure you tape them.  Yeah, well, nobody called, so.  There you go.  All right, FanDick, thank you.  Incidentally, if one of these screeners, if they ever gave out one of these numbers to  our listeners on the air, we would find out who the screener is and make sure that their  number got out.  So that would be a very brutal, brutal error on the screener's part.  Our listeners really don't care if their number gets out, and there's really nothing they  can do.  They go, we got your number, and they really can't do anything with it. 
[00:46:00]  Because our listeners don't really get phone calls.  No.  They're shut-ins.  They really are.  They sit there hoping someone calls.  Right, exactly.  They sit there staring at the phone, hoping it rings.  Yeah.  They stare at that goddamn Wackbag logo on their computer and the phone.  That's it.  Someone please call me.  Let's go to Tickle a Bag from Wackbag.  Tickle a Bag, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi.  What's the deal?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Tickle.  Oh, boy, Tickle. 
[00:46:30]  What's wrong, Tickle?  No, I just wanted to tell you and give a shout-out to Wackbag and the Army, because we mobilized  yesterday and went out to MJ's thread on 93.3, FLD, it's in the mobilization thread on  Wackbag, and it was just a fucking war zone, man.  He had MJ's thread with saying about who's hotter, MJ's wife or ONA, and there's this  blatant post in there about, like, the register user's name would be Little Jimmy's Mule, and 
[00:47:00]  you see fucking Little Jimmy's Mule.  I love the names.  Yeah, Little Jimmy's Mule, it's just, oh, they're both fucking pigs, and it's just carnage, man.  You guys got to check it out, and just prop to the ONA Army.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Ed in Philly, try to get through some of these calls real fast.  Ed, go ahead.  No, I just wanted to say I'm glad to be part of the ONA Army yet again.  Just picked up the XM radio, and, you know, loving it and loving it.  I really wish I had heard that from yesterday.  Would have been right in there.  You guys got to play more of that pick-up from that yesterday. 
[00:47:30]  Play what?  You want to hear more calls.  Play more of the comments from that guy's radio program.  Oh, yeah, we got a couple more, and maybe more comments, so we'll do that in a second here.  Thanks, bro.  Thanks, man.  All right, why don't we play another one here?  This is another call to his show yesterday, the Todd Schnitt Show.  Let's grab, oh, Dick and Tampa on Schnitt.  Hi.  Hi there.  I just want to say thank God you answered. 
[00:48:00]  Yep.  And I was wondering if you had any luck cleaning off the schnit on your belly.  Where are these calls coming from today?  Oh, unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Clean off the schnit on your belly.  The guy had nothing.  Don't you love the really genuine radio app?  Yeah.  Where are these calls coming from?  Oh, boy, I love that. 
[00:48:30]  Strangle him.  All right, we'll be back with more of the schnit show.  You bet.  You bet.  And then the mic's going to turn off, and that guy is raising bloody hell.  Yeah.  Bob.  Let me call up Bob Eatman, my agent.  Right.  Well, he did.  Bob.  Let's go to Brad in Tampa.  But, Brad?  Yeah, I just want to let you guys know, this douchebag has a radio show in the mornings  in Tampa on 93.3.  He's still MJ, and he's still here by himself now.  And he was trashing you guys the other day, saying how easy it is to do your format. 
[00:49:00]  Now, his radio is so smart and so cutting edge, and it's tough to get on the radio and  do that every morning.  Yeah, talk about the filibuster.  Yeah, does he have a penthouse shoot happening this morning on his show?  No.  No, I don't think so.  All right.  Thanks, Brad.  You guys, you could do his MJ morning show with his website for his morning show, so stick  the army on them, too.  Look, he can say whatever he wants.  You know, if he wants to play this game, we love playing this game, but don't go calling  our agent crying like a little baby. 
[00:49:30]  How much air time does this douchebag need?  How many radio shows do you have in that fucking market?  We get it.  You're popular.  Let's go to Jason and Lodi.  Oh, name.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Listening to that show yesterday was torture.  Most of the guys on the board were just saying, how the hell can he do five minutes of radio  and then 20 minutes of commercials?  That's when we all figured out that he wasn't taking calls on purpose, and then later on,  he was just picking, like, random females to take calls from, figuring that was a safer  bet. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, he was just taking calls from girls.  Yeah, if you have the Dylan from Sunrise clip, that was me yesterday, by the way.  Um, oh, okay, yeah, we have that one.  Let's play that now.  I don't know when Dylan was calling that it was going to be trouble.  Why?  Dylan.  Dylan.  The Arnold clip.  Oh, where is it?  Yeah, that's where he got his name from.  Here's that guy's clip.  Dylan is next on Schnitt.  Hi, Dylan.  Schnitt, how are you doing?  Yes, sir.  Just a theory here.  Maybe if you would just, like, maybe lay off and stop filibustering about all these people 
[00:50:30]  and agencies that you're involved with.  I mean, you may even, like, eat a bullet for some of the stuff you're saying.  Hold on, hold on, what are you talking about?  It's just that you're doing your civil duty and it's your job to make sure that who called  you is, you know.  What do you want me to do?  I get enough that calls the show, possibly, and I get specific information about a specific  agent.  I call the office in Los Angeles to give the information to the guy.  What have I done wrong here?  No, I was just talking to my friend about it. 
[00:51:00]  I've taken, I've taken, I took a call yesterday, just like I'm taking your call right now.  Well, I talked to my friend about it and I said, you know what, maybe if you just left  it alone, they would leave him alone.  And he's like, yeah?  And I was like, yeah, that's, that's.  Well, wait a second, this just happened yesterday.  I don't know, man.  I just think you're making a big deal with it.  But, sir, do you have any idea what you're talking about?  No, I'm punching out, man.  That's what I thought.  My God, the freak bags are here today.  I mean, I'm getting folks with mobile meth labs calling in, getting high on their own 
[00:51:30]  supply while they're driving today.  I thought relaying my story of the difficulty that I've had, well, listen, I'm discounting  that guy.  I mean, that guy is just out of his cuckoo nest.  Oh.  I thought it was important to relay the story about the difficulty I'm having just trying  to report something.  Important to tell.  Well, I just sure as hell hope that that's not indicative of the way that things are 
[00:52:00]  all over the place.  And again, it hasn't been completely my experience.  What is he talking about?  What type of history is he trying to, you know, dredge up?  I'm talking about something that happened yesterday.  If you lay off, I'm going to eat a bullet?  What, what, what?  Is that a threat?  Am I getting death threats now?  Who is this guy?  No, asshole to plug.  Oh, my God.  Never a dull moment around here.  Never a freaking dull moment.  I bet there are.  Yeah, of course.  It's from three to six.  You fucking bore. 
[00:52:30]  Who are you, my grandmother?  Never a dull moment.  You're only good when you're asleep.  Elbone to the ribs.  Fout, dead, stank.  That awful show and your phony radio voice.  Ah, ah.  Yeah, freak bags.  Ain't a bullet.  Yeah, ain't a bullet.  Plug your website there, Jimmy.  Let's go to Jim in Dallas.  Jim?  Yeah, you go back to that car from Tampa.  He said, hey, let's grab Dick in Tampa.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Was that the call we just did?  Greg, I'm kidding.  He flew down here. 
[00:53:00]  All right, hold on.  That is funny.  Was it this one?  Dylan is next on Schnitt.  No, no, no.  Hi, Dylan.  Okay, hold on.  No, the other one, Opie.  Yes, sir.  Oh, how do I stop this?  How do I stop this?  How do I stop this?  Let's grab Bo Dick in Tampa on Schnitt.  Let's grab Bo Dick in Tampa.  You're right.  I just want to say I got you answered.  Yep.  And I was wondering if you had any luck.  All right, that's all I want to do, the first part.  Let's grab Bo Dick in Tampa on Schnitt Heights.  That is pretty funny.  All right, one more, and then we've got to move on to other things. 
[00:53:30]  Mitchell in Montreal.  Mitchell?  Hi, how are you guys?  Love you here in Canada.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, hi, little Jimmy.  How are you doing?  Good.  Thanks for asking.  Okay.  Well, we're a lot of Canadians here in Canada.  Of course, we're Canadians because we're losers.  But anyway, a lot of Canadians here in Canada, we love your show.  And, of course, we're all getting it illegally.  I personally have it under someone's name who died a couple of months ago.  And we love your show here.  We want to join your army and create havoc. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, well, I suck.  Okay.  We love the Canadians.  We welcome any Canadians into the army.  You guys look cute on your horses.  I guess you could join the army.  Yeah, I got a mount.  We'll have a few mounties in our army.  A mountie.  What the hell do you guys do anyway?  Jesus.  We don't do very much up here except wish to be Americans.  That's our dream.  Yeah.  We just sit here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get thrown out of Canada and I can join the U.S. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're Canadians.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm glad to get through.  You know the only reason we don't take you guys over is because it's just too damn cold.  We don't want your land.  If it was warmer or you had like oil or something like that, it would be over, Johnny.  Yeah.  We suck here.  But you guys rock.  And I've been enjoying your show ever since.  I got back, Sam, a couple of months ago when you guys came on.  You guys are great.  And I know I'm boring your show and I'm fine yet. 
[00:55:00]  Biggest state in the United States, North Montana.  Imagine that.  Just the huge state of North Montana.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Ian.  Thanks, mister.  Ian from Canada.  Yeah.  I just want to disagree with that dumb asshole from Montreal.  Why?  What's wrong with Mitch?  Well, hey, I'm from Nova Scotia, Canada.  I'm a Canadian.  Yeah.  But a few years ago when Stern finally hit Canada, the Montreal were the first to throw  them out.  Oh, they couldn't take it.  They're fucking assholes. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, Canada, they're worse than the FCC their whole life.  I forget what they're called up there.  But the CBC or something, they are bigger.  You can't do racial humor.  They are fucking babies.  Their FCC is awful.  Oh, they must be hating that a lot of these Canadians are getting the satellite radio for free.  Of course.  They can't take him on commercial radio.  They ain't fucking loving you guys.  Well, probably not.  They're a bunch of douchebags.  Punching assholes.  Well, the guy just wants to join the ONA army.  How far up into Canada can we be heard? 
[00:56:00]  All the way.  Pretty far?  I think all the way.  All the way.  What?  To the Arctic Circle?  All the way.  All the way.  How far?  I don't know.  Like, all the way.  All the way.  I couldn't even tell you a city north of Montreal.  I don't either.  I don't know.  I really know.  That's what I mean by all the way.  I think we get all the way up into Montreal.  All the way.  What is that?  Only a couple hours from the border?  An hour from the border?  Is there some dog sled with a roadie on it?  You know, that's what I'm wondering.  How far up?  I don't know.  To the frigid wasteland.  The tundra. 
[00:56:30]  Hmm.  You got us in Alaska?  Not Alaska.  Really?  Anchorage.  Hey, we got...  Anchorage?  We can be heard in Anchorage, Alaska?  That's cool.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Canada.  Jeff, the Canadians are coming out in full force this morning.  Yeah.  Jeff?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to say, I don't want to be...  I don't want Canada to be represented by some fucking French douchebag in Montreal.  Wow, the rest of Canada hates Montreal. 
[00:57:00]  I'm learning something today.  All those cocksuckers want to do is separate.  Let them go.  Cut them off, yo.  Let them go.  Let them go.  I see.  Hey, well, wasn't Montreal trying to, like, secede or whatever, and then a bunch of other  Canadians showed up with signs and protested, we love you, Montreal, don't leave.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A few years ago.  Well, you know, I think there was a time that we actually owned Montreal, right?  It was part of the United States back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  Someone help me out with my history, but I think that Montreal, way back for like a week, 
[00:57:30]  was part of the United States.  And then we're like, ah, it's too cold up here.  You guys can have this back.  Hey, thank you.  I think we traded like, I don't know, Montana for Montreal or something.  I'm sure beaver pelts were involved.  All right, Jeff, thank you.  Okay, thanks, guys.  I love this.  These guys are just attacking Montreal.  They're eating themselves.  Ryan in Canada.  How's it going, man?  Hey.  Hey.  We can hear you guys already in St. John's, Newfoundland. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What the hell's that?  Where is that?  Way on the island there.  Hey, isn't a big, dude, isn't a big insult in Canada, like the Polish jokes here, they  do Newfie jokes, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's huge.  They're hilarious.  We were partying up there on the long weekend here.  Hey, tell us a Newfie joke.  A Newfie joke?  Yeah.  Oh, man, you're putting me on the spot.  But I'm saying in St. John's, Newfoundland, the most beautiful women you'll ever see. 
[00:58:30]  And the nicest women.  It's awesome.  East or West Canada?  East.  Go Nova Scotia to the island, straight up the island.  And I think that's what you're talking about, Newfoundland.  Wait, you're north of Nova Scotia?  It's right out east.  It's the island of Nova Scotia, Sydney, Nova Scotia, and then right out there is Newfoundland,  the island.  And that's, Newfoundland almost became part of the United States when they came to Canada.  Okay, my cousin's from Toronto.  You ever hear of a guy named Paul Bernardo? 
[00:59:00]  I love that.  Do you know a guy?  All right, thank you, Ryan.  We love you, Jimmy.  Bye, mister.  Thank you.  I want to hear a Newfie joke.  I heard they're like Polish jokes.  Yeah, but it's kind of cute.  Really?  Newfie jokes?  I thought you were just busting his balls.  No, no, no.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Like, how do you babysit a Newfie?  No, no, no, no.  Not that one.  You wet their lips and stick them to the wall?  No?  No.  How many Newfies does it take to tar a roof?  One if you slice them real thin?  No.  What do you say to a Newfie in an alley? 
[00:59:30]  Hello, sir?  What do you say to a Newfie in a suit?  Will the defendant please ride?  What's the difference between a Newfie and a gorilla?  A gorilla peels the banana before he eats it.  I don't know what people from Newfie look like.  I don't either.  A Newfie.  Newfie jokes.  Oh, tee hee.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Let's go to George.  We're on to something with this Canada thing.  George, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Canada is the most racially divided country you're ever going to find.  Everybody hates the French Canadians in Montreal.  Everybody in the country hates the Indians.  They all hate each other, but nobody knows about it.  What about the Asians?  There's just too much room up there.  What about the Asians?  I know they're taking over Toronto.  That's the whole point.  They absolutely hate each other.  It's supposed to be this all real friendly country, no crime.  But they just sit there and hate each other. 
[01:00:30]  I mean, it's a horrible place to live in.  We don't want Canada.  Let's put a fence around it and make it a prison.  I thought you were talking about Boston.  Yeah.  It's the same place.  It's a big Boston.  All right.  Thank you, George.  See you.  Punch it out.  I guess this is a Newfie joke.  How do you tell the Newfie on an oil platform?  He's the one throwing breadcrumbs to the helicopters.  That's like a Polish joke.  You can see it's probably big with the oil rig guys up there in Newfoundland. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, I'm a Newfie.  And he just starts throwing part of a sandwich off.  They all laugh.  They all laugh.  Look at him, stupid.  Let's go to Jamie in Philly.  Jamie?  Hey, what's going on, man?  What's up, Jamie?  Hi.  Not much, man.  Actually, I'm over in Jersey, and we don't like Montreal either.  Fuck them.  All right.  Jersey.  That's all you have today?  No.  Actually, last night I was watching that Discovery Channel show.  The Deadliest Catch, and it was really badass, man.  One of the ships, the Northwestern, had a Sky 5 up in the, I guess, up in the helm. 
[01:01:30]  And he was listening to O&A, best of, not the best of, you know, the rerun.  And you could see it flickering on the screen when you take a, I guess, a TV shot of a computer screen.  It flickers a little bit, but you could see it.  It said O.P. and Anthony, and I thought it was pretty cool, man.  Really?  What show is this, mister?  It's The Deadliest Catch.  It's one of them shows where they, like, it's kind of like a documentary of these guys crab fishing.  Fishermen, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's like a fisherman documentary on guys that go out on the ships.  And they showed, like, Delphi or something, XM Unit, and they had our name in the display?  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened was they went up into the bridge where the guy was captaining or whatever the hell they do.  Captaining.  Yeah, I like that.  This is where I captain.  Yes.  The bridge.  I do my captaining right here.  That's hilarious.  I stink to it.  Well, that helps spread the virus slightly, but, you know, a slight spread of the virus there. 
[01:02:30]  Sure.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Louie and Yonkers.  We're trying to get out of this first break so we could regroup and get Dee Dee in here to do the news.  We've got Mario Cantone calling in and other stuff.  So let's say hi to Louie.  Louie?  Oh, LNA, what's going on, boys?  Great to have you guys back.  How are you doing, Schnookums?  I'm good.  Thanks for asking.  Thanks for calling the program.  No problem, buddy.  Got one, two things Canada's good for, marijuana and blowjobs.  Best place to have a bachelor party in the world. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  Why?  Why?  Dude, the pot's amazing.  The chicks are gorgeous and got to love that American dollar exchange.  You never see that on any of the welcome pamphlets.  Really?  Pot and boy jays.  They're in the campaign room up in Canada.  All right.  Only place in the world.  Yo, boys, when are you guys going to have another, like, celebrity softball tournament type thing?  Welcome you guys back to the N.Y.  Yeah, it's not a bad idea.  Maybe we could get something together for the summer.  What summer?  What? 
[01:03:30]  I know.  It's what?  54 degrees in New York today I'm here.  All right.  Thanks, Louie.  We got a couple Newfie jokes and then we'll finally go to break.  Anthony on Long Island.  Go ahead.  Yo, what's up, Rogue Swallowers?  I got a Newfie joke for you.  Go ahead.  Why do Newfies have flat noses?  Why?  For God to put his foot when he yanked their tails off.  Punch him out.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Bill.  Okay.  I'll try to do this with my best Newfie voice. 
[01:04:00]  Two Newfies go to Toronto to hear they're hiring miners.  So Newfie goes inside and sees the guy hiring.  He says, I hear you hiring some miners up here.  He says, yeah.  They're mine before you die.  He said, mine down on the island.  How far down do you mine?  He says, oh, 30, 40 feet.  He says, oh, we're looking for people to go farther than that.  So he goes outside and he says to his buddy, he says, when you dash, how far have you been  down?  Tell me you've been down a long way.  So he goes and he says, oh, you're mine before you die?  He said, mine down on the island.  He says, how far down have you been?  Oh, 30, 40 miles.  He knows.  He's lying. 
[01:04:30]  He says, 30, 40 miles.  He says, what kind of lighting do you use down there?  Oh, I don't know.  He says, I worked in a day shift.  Oh, Newfie joke that bombed, Anthony.  Wow.  How do you know it bombed?  I know.  All right.  That was more like a Newfie soliloquy.  Do they have any set-up punchlines?  Wow.  And then the Newfie guy, well, it was a third-generation Newfie.  All right.  We get it.  Well, I had no idea that this was even going on Newfie jokes.  No clue.  I learned something new.  A couple things.  A five-minute joke and the punchline is, I worked the day shift. 
[01:05:00]  I worked the day shift.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in New York City.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, see, after the Civil War, a bunch of drunk Irishmen invaded Canada, and they held  on to some fort for about a week, and they wanted to basically trade Canada for Ireland  from the British.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's what happened.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brian in California.  Brian?  Yeah, that's what happened.  Yeah, what's the difference between Moosehead in Canada and Moosehead in Virginia? 
[01:05:30]  Virginia, it's a beer, and Canada, it's a felony.  Punching out.  Whoa, I don't know if I even understood that one.  I did.  What happened?  Moosehead's a beer, and one place it's a beer, and one place it's a felony.  Meaning that it's a beer here, but over there, a moosehead means that you have a moose  suckling on your heart.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  I didn't quite understand it.  We've got to go back to Mitch, who started this whole thing from Montreal.  He wants to defend himself.  Mitch?  Hi, guys.  How's it going again?  Hey, Mitch.  Hey, Mitch.  All I want to say is, first of all, I'm not French. 
[01:06:00]  I'm not a scumbag Frenchman.  That's, first of all, there's a lot of English people who live in Montreal.  Second of all, I want to give you the proper terminology for Frenchmen.  We call them here Pepsis.  Pepsi why?  Why?  Well, we call them Pepsis because when I was growing up, a Frenchman, or a Pepsi, we'd  call them, all they do every day for breakfast is they have a Maywest and a Pepsi until their  teeth rotted out.  So that's why we call them Pepsis.  A Maywest?  What's a Maywest? 
[01:06:30]  A Maywest is a Quebec treat.  It's like a, do you ever hear of a Joe Louis?  No.  No, man.  We've got all kinds of weird stuff.  Okay.  It's like a Twinkie, let's say.  A Quebec Twinkie.  They have awful breath?  Twinkies and Pepsi?  Ugh.  For breakfast, it would be Pepsi and Twinkie.  And they got this, they'd be doing this, they're like kicks out here in Quebec, in Montreal,  let's say.  And that's what they have for breakfast.  It'd be a Pepsi and a Maywest. 
[01:07:00]  And since then, we call them Pepsis.  And that's, anyone in Canada knows that everyone hates the Pepsis.  Maywest?  The whole separation thing, you know, everyone hates the Pepsis.  What did Voss name that?  Hey.  Call it a Maywest.  All right, Mitch.  Thank you.  Hubba hubba.  Okay, guys.  We'll see you later.  Wait, are you Mitch of Mitch and Murray?  Let's go to Dan in New York.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Nice to hear you on the radio.  Baloney Tits.  Always a pleasure.  That's a lot of fun.  Did you hear about the Newfie bank robber? 
[01:07:30]  No.  Tied up the safe, blew the guard.  Tied up the safe, blew the guard.  Let's go to Big Joe.  Big Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, Butterwing.  Hi.  Hey, how you doing?  Got a little Newfie joke for you.  How do you keep a Newfie out of your backyard?  How?  You hang one in the front.  Holy Jesus.  I noticed these Newfie jokes.  Yeah, Leroy.  A little different.  They sound familiar.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Leroy from Alabama. 
[01:08:00]  I love this.  We talked to a Frenchie in Montreal and Leroy in Alabama.  What's up?  We don't want no goddamn Canucks in the Army shit.  We barely tolerate the Negras.  Y'all have a good day.  All right.  Jesus, Leroy.  This show is about love, isn't it?  It's about just showing the love of other people across countries.  Yeah.  And Judy is shocked.  We are so doomed as an Earth, as a planet.  We're doomed on a planetary level, Opie. 
[01:08:30]  No.  There will never be harmony between people.  The phones have exploded, but we have to take a break.  We've got to get more Starbucks coffee, and we've got to get Dee Dee in here, and I don't  know.  Keep answering the phone calls.  We'll go to them after the break, okay?  Roy!  All right.  Hit it.  The hourglass.  So is the O&A virus.  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  I mean, when I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get rid of it.  All right.  Well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know...  I know...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I've got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this. 
[01:09:30]  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore. 
[01:10:00]  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horns like...  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude.  You're so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented.  I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  I killed himself.  Right.  I've done it all.  I was the first one to do anything.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked the... 
[01:10:30]  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the...  What was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw... 
[01:11:00]  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called the fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin. 
[01:11:30]  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  That was me.  Robin and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Feeling roses disappearing into mold with a dry mouth.  Breaking into form, not sealing our intentions.  And the city is an oil drying cleaner.  Ah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:12:00]  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday, by the way.  I have no idea.  It could be 100 degrees out in Washington or 32.  We have no idea.  That's what sucks about being down here at the XM compound.  In New York City, we have that fine studio they built for us, and we got windows so we  could take a peek outside and see what it's doing. 
[01:12:30]  Down here, you have no idea.  We're in the bowels.  And these people down here, they talk about that.  You know, they say it kind of sucks in the summer because you get here, and then you  have no idea what's going on outside, and then you finally leave this place and go,  Whoa, hey!  Yeah, it was nice out.  It was nice all day.  They have nowhere to hang out outside, I noticed.  I guess they don't want their employees hanging outside because it is the ghetto.  No, they kind of hang out in front of the door, I guess.  Yeah, you can't really go smoke anywhere.  The cigarette smokers are gathering by the doorways. 
[01:13:00]  By the way, Whip Them Out Wednesday, basically you put a wow on your car, and if the girls  see the wow and they feel like it, they will flash you on the highway.  It works, I'm telling you.  We don't spend a lot of time on it these days because the show is slowly but surely growing  and getting back to where it used to be.  And then we'll make a real big deal at a wow.  But to get started, basically get a wow sticker, get it on your car.  It supports the show, and also, you never know.  You could be driving, and all of a sudden, one of these ladies might flash you, okay?  You can get your wow stickers by going to opieandanthony.com. 
[01:13:30]  We're sending those stickers out every single day.  Hundreds of them.  Hundreds of envelopes come to us in New York, and we stuff them with the wow stickers for  you.  Right.  Let's go to Ray on Long Island.  Ray, what's up?  Good morning.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Let's make it fast because we're going to move on to other things here.  A newfie and a gorilla sitting in a tree.  What do you call a newfie?  What?  Assistant branch manager.  Punching out.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  This is nothing but trouble when the listeners get involved with this. 
[01:14:00]  They ruin it every single time.  Well, there are times the listeners take over the show, and here they go.  This is the direction they want to go in, Anthony.  Oh, boy.  Nick in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What are you calling a newfie doctor?  Huh?  Nigger.  See?  All right.  See?  Trevor.  See?  Yeah.  I told you.  What's up, Trevor?  They ruin it every time.  What's up, Trevor?  How are you doing?  How do you get a one-armed newfie out of a tree?  A one-eyed newfie out of a tree? 
[01:14:30]  No, one-armed newfie.  Oh, one-armed.  One-armed newfie out of a tree.  You wave to him.  You wave to him.  See?  That's a newfie joke.  Yes, it is.  You bastards.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I love you.  All right.  Hi, tuna tits.  Hi, mister.  How does a newfie mother know when her daughter's on the rag?  How does a newfie mother know when her daughter's on the rag?  How?  Her son's dick tastes funny.  Punch it up. 
[01:15:00]  You know, I...  Jesus, man.  I like these newfie jokes.  Oh.  It's kind of like deja vu, though.  I think I'm right.  Oh, it certainly is.  Kevin in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to know if Professor Anthony was aware that Newfoundland is a half hour  off from Nova Scotia's time zone.  Oh, really?  New York is Eastern Standard, and Halifax is an hour before us. 
[01:15:30]  Newfoundland is a half hour before that.  Well, tell me more.  Well, that's kind of silly.  How do you know when your show's on?  I don't know.  Half hour?  That's all that time zone stuff is good for, knowing when to watch, I don't know.  TV.  CSI.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's, man, the phones have explored.  We've got to get onto other things, though.  Jeff in Canada?  Hey.  Screw the newfie jokes.  How about a French one?  All right.  Okay.  There's a Jew. 
[01:16:00]  There's a German and a Frenchman.  They're all waiting for their wife to have babies.  So the doctor comes out.  He says, good news.  He says, all your wives have babies, but we can't tell them apart.  So the Frenchman goes in, comes back out, says, I don't know.  The Jew goes in, comes back out, says, I'm just as confused.  The German goes in, comes back out, and he goes, here's your son, here's your son, and  this is my son.  They said, that's great.  How'd you do it?  He says, I said, hi, old Hitler.  My son stood up and saluted me. 
[01:16:30]  The Jewish hit his pants, and the Frenchman ate it.  I can't help, boys.  Wow.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  I cannot be party to this.  Anyone?  Touched it live?  Almost.  No?  Damn.  All right.  Let's get DeeDee in here.  Wow.  The freak bags are on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  People calling her like cuckoo nets. 
[01:17:00]  This guy's out of his cuckoo's net.  He's out of his cuckoo's net.  Yeah.  Hey, DeeDee.  Hi.  DeeDee.  Hello.  Good morning.  To the new listeners, DeeDee is, I gotta tell you, our favorite.  When we come down to the XM compound, DeeDee is our number one fellow employee.  DeeDee used to be on XM Kids.  Yes.  She was cricket.  I was cricket.  On XM Kids.  And, um...  Not anymore, though. 
[01:17:30]  Not anymore.  No.  She started coming on our show.  She started coming on our show, and I guess people at XM figured it probably wasn't a  good idea.  Too-wee-pee-wee-hermanish, I was told.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea.  Maybe, maybe the kids would be listening to XM Kids and start hitting the buttons on  their XM radio and go, oh, that's the cricket voice.  I hear cricket.  And then thinking, you know, it was the XM Kids show with cricket, and then hear your  awful, perverse stories of drug abuse, alcohol addiction, and sex. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, you remember that?  Of course I do.  Of course we do.  They're some of our favorite stories.  And counterfeit money.  Oh, yeah.  And doing the...  Mommy, do you fuck the FedEx, man?  No, UPS.  UPS.  Oh, UPS, whatever.  Yeah.  She's particular.  Yeah, she likes the UPS.  She's particular?  Yeah, particular, I was going to say, sure.  Do we get to spank you today?  Mm-hmm.  We don't have our official spanker.  Keith did it last time. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, you even had the microphone down there.  Yeah, we're ready.  We got your ass mic'd and everything.  We're ready to go.  I don't have a belt, so...  Oh, well.  Anyway, now I can't...  Who gets the spanked Edie today?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Jimmy, you want a spanker today?  All right.  Oh, God!  All right.  Yeah.  Well, I'm doing the news again.  Yeah, because no one really cares about the news.  Although a lot of preparation went into this news, I think, right?  Do you understand they want us to have a... 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, I have producers now.  Nice.  They want us to have a news person so badly.  You've been saying this for how long now?  I know.  A whole gag.  Like, the only reason we have you doing the news is because of all the great stories we  get out of you.  Yeah.  Wow.  So we suffer through some news, and then we get to the meat of why you're in the studio.  We find out things like her getting drunk and blacking out in Las Vegas and marrying  an English guy that turned out to be a counterfeiter.  Yep.  There you go.  My best story is like that. 
[01:19:30]  My best Dee Dee story is the one where she woke up in a gas station bathroom in New Orleans.  I had no idea how I got there from Philly.  And was like, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Why am I here?  I was in Philly, and now I'm in a gas station bathroom in New Orleans.  I don't remember booking the flight, being on the plane.  Yeah.  It was like time travel.  You can't just have like a glass of wine or something.  I black out.  That's even like a glass of wine.  You wouldn't stop, right?  It's hard.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  You would just keep drinking.  Probably.  You'd get a little buzz and go like, screw this.  I'm just going to drink.  See, you know, it's tough with me.  You know, I mean, I respect people that want to stop drinking and stuff and want to stop  drugging.  I get that.  But man, how tempting is it to give her a glass of wine right now?  Tempting.  I want to pin her down, put a funnel in her mouth, and dump Jack Daniels down it.  Like Caligula.  Because you just know it would be just a ride for everybody. 
[01:20:30]  It would be fun and entertaining to watch until she blacks out, and then we'd all have  sex.  Right.  Oh, God.  No.  No?  Yeah, you don't want to know.  I was, you know, I was angry.  I cry when I, people told me I would cry when I was drinking.  Really?  I just started talking and I started crying.  I love that.  When I was on gin and tonics.  I'm like, oh, you're my best friend, and I'd be crying.  That's when you're halfway where I need you to be.  Right, Jimmy? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one.  All right.  Well, I guess we could start with some news.  When do we get to spank you, though?  And do you have any stories for us today?  You always come in with one.  Well, okay.  This happened.  Somebody went through my mail.  Oh.  Yeah.  And they took a bill that I sent to make a payment, and they took my check, and they  like erased the ink.  So, yeah.  And spent money on, and wrote another check?  Wait, you could erase ink? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  On check?  On check?  But not gel ink.  The detective told me, use gel ink next time.  What's gel ink?  Gel ink, you know?  Wait, is this a...  It's a pen made with gel.  Yeah.  This is a new scam going on where people could actually erase the ink on your check and use it?  It's not new.  I guess it's been going on for a while.  But, yeah.  They can go through your mail.  Anything.  They can...  If they see that, oh, it's a bill.  Maybe she wrote a check, you know?  Right.  And, yeah.  And then they make that off, and then they write something else in there.  Yeah.  Like, pay to the...  But who is pay to the order of?  Wouldn't that, like, catch them?  Well...  Maybe pay to the order of cash. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Well...  They have a stolen identity or something like that.  They probably have a stolen identity.  They write it to that person.  Well...  They get a big ID.  I just found out, because I was, like, going online and looking.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  I wrote that check for...  That number goes to my bill.  That's not to so-and-so.  I'm like, what's going on here?  So I called the bank.  And I...  Yeah.  Don't you need...  You know something?  I have gone into banks, like, years ago, before I had an account or something.  You know, I was really, like, tough times and everything.  And I'd get a check from somewhere and need to cash it.  And it was impossible to cash a goddamn check.  Like, I'd have all kinds of ID and everything. 
[01:22:30]  But they'd be...  You can't cash...  You need an account to cash it.  We have this.  We got to hold the funds.  You can't do...  How do people erase the ink, write something in, and get money for this?  They're professionals.  Professionals.  How does that not show up that it was erased, though?  I don't get that.  I bet they were newfies.  Yeah.  Right?  Always stealing.  I'm not saying anything.  Yeah.  How much did they write in?  A thousand-something.  Did you have enough to cover it?  Well, yeah, but it's still a pain to, like, deal with. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, and then now what did the bank say?  Did they give you your money back?  Yeah, yeah.  I got my money back.  It's all guaranteed, insured and stuff.  And then did it say cash?  Did you see the check?  I...  It was written out to something.  To a name?  To a person.  To a person.  Yeah.  And a thousand dollars?  Over a thousand, yeah.  Over a thousand.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a great little scam.  Yeah, well, no.  I've heard of that.  Yeah, so use gel ink. 
[01:23:30]  That's what the detective told me.  Gel ink.  Gel ink.  We were hoping for a better story than that.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you mean like a sex story or something?  Yeah.  We love Dee Dee's sex stories.  Well, you know, Mom and Dad are back in Chicago.  Listening to the show.  No.  No.  No.  I'm probably still sleeping.  I better hope so.  Yeah.  All right, we'll get a story out of you.  I guarantee it.  Dee Dee, how do you know if you have gel ink?  Because it says it on the package.  It says gel ink.  Okay.  You just want me to say gel ink, right? 
[01:24:00]  No, I actually have regular ink.  Okay.  Hey, what's the...  Ink.  Ink.  Ink.  Ink.  Gel ink.  Ink.  What's the MS abbreviation?  Multiple sclerosis?  Well, we're talking about, like, states and stuff.  Mississippi, right?  Missouri.  Missouri.  Missouri?  That's M-I-M-I.  Beth, where are you from?  Missouri.  Missouri.  Wow, this could be our first call from Missouri.  Michigan.  All right, turn down your XM and tell us what you got for the show.  Okay, I taught a program on how they erase the ink. 
[01:24:30]  They do it like a photo finishing.  They put it in a solution, and it dissolves the ink on the front ink pen, and it comes out  with, like, a blank check.  And what, did they just leave the signature?  They forged a signature.  They forged...  Wait a minute, they...  They forged a signature.  Wow.  Yeah.  I thought they would just erase what they needed.  No, they look at how I sign my name, I guess.  They copy it first.  Yeah.  Wow.  Or photograph it.  Something, yeah.  Oh, I had no idea that this was going on.  They dip the check in something, the ink dissolves, and then they... 
[01:25:00]  Aren't there safeguards in checks that, like, if there's that solution, the check would  just kind of disappear or something?  Regular ink, it's really easy to do.  Regular what?  Ink.  How do you know if your ink has been tampered with, though?  Ink.  You need to use gel ink.  Gel ink.  Ink.  Ink.  Ink.  I can't help the way I talk.  Wow.  Are you a member of Murder Ink?  No.  Thank you, Beth.  All right, bye.  Bye. 
[01:25:30]  I guess everyone's saying the same thing.  Jason, is that how you get rid of the ink?  Yeah, that's right.  Okay, then we don't need you?  Uh, I guess not.  All right, sorry.  All right.  And Tony from Montana, same thing.  Wow, calls coming from all over today.  All right, let's get into some news with Dee Dee, and then we'll spank her and finger  her and all sorts of stuff.  Oh, we'll spank her.  Yeah.  Remember that contest?  Let's see who can get the most...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I'm not drinking.  You're not fingering.  Mm-mm.  I'm not drinking.  No drinking. 
[01:26:00]  It's an I-N-K thing, this rock.  Oh, God.  What other words are...  Never drink ink.  Do you stink?  No, I don't stink.  Yeah.  You like it in the pink?  Give me a wink.  Wait, what was the one word that she kept screwing up that was...  I don't know.  Do you remember the word we kept having her say last time?  Yeah.  You mean the state?  Chicago?  No, no.  I know it's not the state, but I mean, did we...  Was it Chicago you had a problem with? 
[01:26:30]  Not Chicago.  What the hell was it?  You're right, Jimmy.  There was something...  One word.  She was...  Oh, by the way...  I'm trying to remember.  Doughboy is reminding us that you were supposed to bring in your toys.  Oh, I'll have to do that tomorrow.  Who's Doughboy?  Doughboy's from Whackbag.com.  If you're going to be part of the show, you've got to know the players.  Do they remember everything?  Who's Doughboy?  I thought they had short attention.  Three in the pink, one in the stink.  What is that word?  It's driving me nuts now.  I know.  It's when we were talking about Australia. 
[01:27:00]  No?  No.  What's the word?  You know what?  The listeners know more than us at this point.  They'll let us know in a second.  It'll probably be on Instant Feedback.  All right.  Um, let's get into some news here with DeeDee.  Okay.  Yes.  So, you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Of course.  Well, we were going to give you some teletype and stuff.  Okay, I'll wait for you.  All right, here we go.  It's annoying.  It's annoying?  Yeah, it's like...  It disturbs me.  All news, all day, all night. 
[01:27:30]  And now, the news with DeeDee.  DeeDee.  Hi.  Hi.  Wednesday, troops in Iraq began a second major operation in...  Oh, here's the word.  Haddaha.  Or something like that.  A small city about 150 miles northwest of the Iraq capital.  I can't say it.  Haddaha.  Haddaha?  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you.  It's just a tongue twister word for me.  Okay, the fighting has been particularly fierce in the vast western region where the death toll has reached a three-day high. 
[01:28:00]  A convoy had a car bomb, which exploded next to killing three Americans, while another soldier was murdered in a drive-by shooting minutes after the explosion.  These four deaths increased the death toll for 72 hours at 14 Americans.  That El Zarqawi is a real fink.  Yeah, he is a fink.  The death toll...  He's sleepery.  Sleepery?  Okay.  The death toll for Iraqis is in the same time frame as about 60. 
[01:28:30]  And the death toll has surged since the announcement on April 28th by Prime Minister...  Ibrahim...  I hate these words.  Ibrahim El Jafari.  I know he's a nice guy, but he has a weird name.  That the new government will be comprised mostly by Shia Muslims.  And thus far, 58 troops have been killed since the announcement.  On a positive note, though...  Hold on a minute.  There is a positive note.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, is this the same story?  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Okay, go ahead.  After you're done with that story, I'm sorry.  I think so.  One of the primary instigators of the recent violence has been wounded.  Abu Musab El Zakhari has a group of like-minded animals called Al-Qaeda in Iraq.  U.S. officials are not confirming this news as authentic as it is possible.  All the reports of injury are fake.  And El Zakhari has made a name for himself by beheading Americans.  Zakhari.  Zakhari.  Whatever!  No, no, whatever.  Zakhari.  That's a biggie.  It's like... 
[01:29:30]  I can't just...  That's one of the biggies.  He is almost as wanted as Bin Laden.  I know.  He's pretty much number two, I think.  Remember Al Sader, by the way?  Can I jump in?  Remember Al Sader, the guy who was starting the whole insurgency?  His father...  Yeah.  He just completely dropped off the face of the earth?  Where did he go?  He's got to be bumming he's not like top dog.  Dude, no one has thought about him in six months.  No.  Wow.  So there's the news in Iraq.  But I have some jail.  I don't know.  All right, hold on one second, though.  Dan has the word.  Dan in PA.  Oh, God, no.  Dan?  Oh, wait.  Why can't I hear you?  Hold on, man. 
[01:30:00]  Hold on, sweetie.  All right, try again.  Go ahead.  Yeah, this is Dan.  You got me?  Okay, there it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys were teasing her about the word sting because she was saying that stings when  you were paddling her.  Oh, the last time you were feeding me.  It's I-N-G.  It's I-N-G.  It's stings.  It's the I-N-G.  Stings.  Oh, that's stings.  And she was squealing, man, every time you got it.  All right, so it's a whole I-N thing.  There was an Australia thing, too, though.  I-N-K, I-N-G.  There was an Australia thing, too.  It was Australia.  Where the Wiggles are from. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, that's right.  The Wiggles.  She couldn't say Australia.  Yeah, the Wiggles.  Australia.  Australia.  Australia.  That's right.  That's what it was.  My tongue just goes the other way.  I don't know why.  All right, let's go back to the news with Gigi.  Speaking of news, if we could just put the word out, CBS had a clip of Burt Reynolds slapping  a producer for CBS News.  When did he slap him?  Just like recently.  I guess, let's see.  Sorry to hone in on your news here.  No, that's fine.  Burt Reynolds reportedly slapped a WCBS-TV assistant producer in the face at a movie premiere in 
[01:31:00]  Manhattan.  The producer was asking Reynolds, 69, about his new movie, The Longest Yard, outside the  premiere at a Chelsea theater.  When the actor became annoyed, you don't know anything about the movie, Reynolds asked.  The producer acknowledged he hadn't seen it or the original 1974 version.  Reynolds then slapped the producer.  What kind of a guy are you, he asked.  Good boy, Burt.  In a statement by a spokesman, he said Reynolds was just playfully tapping the producer on 
[01:31:30]  the cheek as if to say, well, that's not very nice.  He was kidding.  Not like a real, you know, full fist Lonnie Anderson punch.  He's probably just teasing around.  What kind of guy are you?  Come on.  It's news.  Well, there's video of it, so I'll have to get a look at that.  And Burt Reynolds is known to lose his temper and be a little physical, so I could see  him probably slapping the kid. 
[01:32:00]  He's 69 years old?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Burt Reynolds is 70?  He's got to be older.  I'm thinking older.  How old was he in, like...  Dude, I didn't know he was 40 in Smokey and the Bandit.  Yeah, he looked old in Smokey and the Bandit.  Not old, but, you know...  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  77?  Was it about, right?  Almost 30 years, let's say?  74.  It was 30 years ago.  So he was 38 when he did Longest Yard.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  69 years old now.  I would have thought Burt Reynolds was, like, maybe 55.  Really?  Or, yeah, 58.  I would have went with 67.  No, but that's...  I would have went with...  He's a Leo.  I would have went with, um, who cares, actually.  But I could have known he was just such a sex symbol.  Number one box office draw.  Well, in the 70s, he was, yes.  Let's, uh, let's go to DeeDee.  Okay.  He tried to hold his head up in his wig.  He had...  I was like, I would have...  His head would just fall out front of the wig.  You're the infidel! 
[01:33:00]  Dammit.  Picking up by the ears.  All right, let's go back to DeeDee with more news.  Okay, so Jay Leno testified in the Michael Jackson trial yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  In a not-so-serious testimony for the defense, Leno told jurors that he was never asked for  money by Jackson's accuser.  A real blow.  Yes.  To the, uh, defense.  Because they thought, uh, Leno was going to get up there and say, yeah, this kid, uh,  well, this kid, uh, you know, called me up and trying to get some money off of me. 
[01:33:30]  And, uh, apparently he didn't ask for money.  I'm going to find out.  I'll have to ask Jay about that in June when I see him.  Oh, oh, tonight's show appearance.  Yes, nice.  Nice.  When in June?  Uh, June 12th.  Oh, 13th?  Yeah, June 13th.  Look at our little...  June 13th.  Jimmy.  I'll talk to Jay.  I'll see what he has to say.  Okay, I'll call him.  Jim Norton will be on the Jay Leno show.  We have some Leno clips.  Let's see what these are all about there, DeeDee, all right?  Here's the first one.  I tell you, you know the worst part about testifying?  I had to follow the chimp.  Oh, yeah.  The witness chair was a mess. 
[01:34:00]  It was awful.  Newfie?  It was an awful thing.  Oh, this...  It's not bad, man.  He's gotten, uh...  I love his stand-up.  No, you're saying Newfie.  Newfie.  Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment when I took the stand.  They asked me to point to the defendant, and I pointed out Latoya.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The moral report says he wants to go to Africa and disappear.  He wants to disappear in Africa.  Africa.  They have a better chance of disappearing in Sweden.  Hey, bravo. 
[01:34:30]  Very funny.  Racial jokes.  Very nice.  Very funny.  Let's see that on CBS at the same time.  I certainly doubt it.  Speaking of racial jokes, let's get another Newfie joke on the air.  Oh, no.  Eric in New Hampshire.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, guys.  Hey, DeeDee.  Hi.  I got a bit of a clarification on DeeDee's first story.  Yeah.  The ink story.  I was curious.  The animals that she's talking about, the Al-Qaeda animals, were they kind of like San  Newfies?  Oh, that's just wrong.  Go on. 
[01:35:00]  On to now.  All right.  There.  Let's get back to the news with DeeDee.  All right.  Well, we just talked about J-Lo.  But you know what?  At the end of his testimony, he made it in a point to mention that his guest would be  Renee Zellweger.  So, that's how he ended his testimony.  He plugged his show.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He plugged his show.  He plugged Zellweger's appearance.  That's funny.  At a child molesting trial.  That rocks.  That is good.  Yeah.  It's like standing in the lawn in Colorado in December of whatever year it was, 96, and 
[01:35:30]  yelling, eatabullet.com as he roped off the area.  Hey, we got a few more Jackson clips here to get to.  The final defense witness, comedian Chris Tucker, returns today.  He could wrap up by midday, and the defense plans to rest without calling Michael Jackson  to the stand.  Prosecutors say they have rebuttal witnesses ready and should finish with them by tomorrow.  Whether or not the defense has rebuttal witnesses, closing arguments should begin next  week. 
[01:36:00]  But it could be the week after that before the jury gets the case.  Tucker was on the stand briefly yesterday telling how he met the boy who's now Jackson's  accuser, Brian Bland, at the courthouse, Santa Maria, California.  Brian Bland.  Yeah.  Appropriate name.  This case has been over for a long time.  Jackson's walking.  Of course he is.  There's no problem.  You're probably right, but I think there's been a few blows to the defense that people probably  didn't count on.  The fact that he doesn't take the stand is sickening.  How do you not take the stand when you're accused of molesting children? 
[01:36:30]  How do you not get up there and just say it's not true?  Your lawyer always advises.  Ugh.  Scumbag lawyers.  Stay up to stand.  They think they probably have it won anyway.  So they figure, why have him get up there and maybe, you know, grope a young child in  front of the jury?  Leave him alone.  But if you're telling the truth, I mean, wouldn't you want to be on the stand and say, I didn't  do that?  How would you, how can they trap you if you're not lying?  Some people, even while they're telling the truth, just look like they're full of shit.  I know.  And sometimes it's bad for them. 
[01:37:00]  They don't make good witnesses, even for themselves.  I know, but there's a, you know, that's a, I don't know.  But if I'm a juror, I'm sitting there, ah, well, he's got to be guilty.  He doesn't even want to defend himself.  Absolutely.  It's simple in my mind.  We were talking about that, what, last week?  I'd be an awful witness, especially for myself.  I'd just be a nervous Nelly.  When I was up on the stand in my divorce case, I couldn't even remember my anniversary date.  That's how bad I was.  And when were you married, Mr. Comey?  I'm like, I don't, I don't remember.  I'm the worst witness ever. 
[01:37:30]  I came off as being a, that's one of the funniest things ever.  Because it wasn't like you were married for a year.  You had to celebrate anniversary.  For nine years, I was married.  Nine of them.  I was married nine years.  He asked me, when is your wedding anniversary?  I don't, I don't know.  I don't recall.  It turned into Reagan on the stand.  I had no clue.  Where, where did you meet?  Well, I don't remember. 
[01:38:00]  Right?  Do you remember your ex-wife's name?  Phyllis.  I don't recall.  That was me.  I was a blithering, blathering idiot on the stand.  And I would make an awful witness.  If I had to testify in my defense, they'd tell me just don't.  Maybe you would.  But if they pointed at a young boy and said, you sucked his cock, you'd try to remember.  Nope, didn't do that.  You'd think you could say no.  Wait, did I?  I don't remember if I held them. 
[01:38:30]  Then you'd know.  Could you define suck?  Yeah.  Just doing this to the helmet count.  Oh!  Oh, that's just wrong.  I love when you get shocked Dee Dee.  It's the best.  Oh, he'll do that again?  That's the, uh...  You hold the bag gently and you'll...  Look at him run when he does that.  It's like a snake, right Dee Dee?  That's hot, right?  You're awful like a Dee Dee.  Oh my goodness.  Didn't you see his tongue when he did that? 
[01:39:00]  That's funny.  I love that there's an innocence to her, even though she's just an animal.  She also understands something.  Dee Dee definitely understands that.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  All right, let's play another clip here from the Jackson trial.  See what this one's about.  The defense told the jury to expect the comic to say the accuser's family hounded him for money.  Leno said he did get lots of voicemail from the cancer-stricken boy in 2000.  But when Leno called him, neither the boy nor his mother asked for money, and that was their only conversation.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, well, that's what he said.  Leno says the messages made him suspicious, but in his only return phone call to the cancer-stricken boy in 2000,  no one brought up money, and the family never tried to contact Leno again.  Maybe they just saw they weren't going to get any cash out of him.  Mary Holzer testified the mother said the injuries cited in her claim that ended in a $152,000 settlement  were actually from a beating by her husband.  Prosecutors, though, say that's impossible because doctors examined the woman after the Penny's incident 
[01:40:00]  before she saw her husband.  What's that one about, Ann?  What?  I don't even know what that's about.  Oh.  The accuser's mom or something?  The whole family's shady.  Oh, whatever.  She got some kind of a settlement.  We're spending too much time in the Jackson trial.  This is just a...  A three-ring circus.  This is exactly what the defense wanted to do, though.  This is one of those trials where people just gave up.  You know, at the onset of this thing, it sounded very interesting. 
[01:40:30]  Everybody wanted to know all the details, and it just fell apart where they confused the issue so much  that you don't really care anymore.  And Michael Jackson will walk, and he's done this.  I absolutely believe he's a child molester, and there's no cure.  The guy obviously doesn't even realize it, so he's not going to try to seek treatment.  And so he'll just do it again and use his money to pay off the parents and whatever else he needs to do,  and he'll continue.  Another inept L.A. prosecution. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Another major case.  What a batting record these assholes have.  Terrible.  I was into this case from the beginning, and then all of a sudden, you can't find any info.  It's deep in the papers, and now it's like, like Ann said, it's like, who cares?  Who cares?  And that's exactly what the defense wants.  And without the DNA evidence, it's tough to send this guy away.  Oh, if they had a Michael Jackson load to go through, where'd it come from?  Out of that little boy's hiney.  Okay.  They squeezed the kid like toothpaste and it leaked out.  On his little Peter Pan undies. 
[01:41:30]  Underoos.  Underoos.  Underoos.  You pick him up on the stand, and you give him a tight bear hug, and you hear, blurp.  And the back of his leg has evidence all over it.  Old Volcano took us.  Oh.  Like to bring these tough skins to the lab.  Should we get Suri in here before she has to go on the air?  We should say hi to Suri.  She does the 70s channel here at XM.  Oh.  We're trying to get to know.  Like the 70s channel?  We're trying to get to know more of the employees. 
[01:42:00]  I think that's the mic that'll work, or.  I'm with the band.  Nice shirt.  I like the decades channels.  Definitely.  Like the 70s, 80s.  Let's see.  I think that mic will work for you.  Does it work?  Do you know how to work it?  Not really.  That's really the whole problem here.  What's up, kids?  How you doing?  Welcome to D.C.  Oh, thank you.  This is the first time we've had you on the air there, Suri.  Yeah.  Yeah, actually it is.  I've heard her on the 70s channel.  Yep.  I have too.  Absolutely.  I listen.  Thanks.  I listen to that. 
[01:42:30]  I listen to the 60s.  It's a little odd.  You go to the 60s?  Sometimes I go.  Sometimes I'm switching around.  I even go to the 50s.  What?  Sometimes.  Well, you get the oldie time.  Yeah, but if you want to go 50s, you've got to go to Frank's Place.  Oh, no.  Frank's Place makes it easy.  It's like the hits.  It's Sinatra and stuff.  Yeah, but it's all that.  But they're not 50s.  What?  But it's not all 50s.  Frank's Place?  Oh.  I don't know.  I don't know my decades.  Well, the doo-wop.  It's not beginning to get on the 50s channel, which I kind of like.  Yeah, you want to hear a little doo-wop?  Like, man that cancels a show called Harlem that's awesome. 
[01:43:00]  It's awesome.  What's Harlem about?  It's like all different kinds of acts.  You know, like Howlin' Wolf, I think, is being featured this week.  Yeah.  Like, people like that.  You know?  What's wrong with the little Howlin' Wolf?  Talk about Sun Records and Memphis.  It's really cool.  I like to put on the 40s channel and I have Patrice in the car and just look at him and kind of  smile and half nod.  Look over at him.  I'm still discovering new channels on XM every day. 
[01:43:30]  But the 70s channel is definitely one of the ones I go to a lot.  Seven days.  Yeah.  Okay, so the reason why I'm here is I want to talk about the 4 million subscriber celebration  thing we're doing over on the 70s this weekend.  Oh.  It's really cool.  Because we're doing, you know, since we have 4 million subscribers.  You're playing Peter Frampton in Boston.  Sort of, yeah.  Of course you are.  But we're doing, like, the top 70 selling albums of the 70s.  Oh, well.  Frampton comes alive in Boston. 
[01:44:00]  Well, there's a lot of, you know.  What's going to be number one?  I can't tell you.  What did you do?  Come on.  No, you've ruined it.  That's what we do on a daily basis.  We ruin everyone's life.  We wreck everyone's buzz.  4 p.m. on the East, 1 p.m. on the West Friday.  Let's at least guess the top album of the 70s.  I would say Frampton comes alive.  Frampton comes alive.  Does it have to be rock or no?  Does it have to be rock or no?  No, it's all different kinds of albums.  It's cool.  You want to look at the book?  Slim Whitman.  Maybe it's a book.  What do you think it is?  Seriously, what do you think it is? 
[01:44:30]  Do you really?  I think 70s top.  Oh, my dumb.  The number one selling album of the 70s.  I know it.  I'm going to guess it's a Beatles or an Elvis record.  Beatles.  I don't know.  Beatles were in the 70s.  Beatles were starting to fade.  They still may have had, like, a hit.  I'm thinking Boston's first album.  You're so rock.  You guys are really off.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh?  What?  What was that?  We're cheating right now in class.  We're trying to get the answer from somebody else.  Guide it down, man.  And pass it. 
[01:45:00]  I can't believe you guys don't.  All right.  Well.  Could you show us?  I'm trying to think.  Huh?  Could you at least show us?  It just ruins the surprise.  We can't.  Give us a hint.  Then, you know.  Boston's not even close.  Boston's first album.  No, you're not even close.  You're not even close.  Okay.  Okay.  Here's your hint.  I know it is.  All right.  Here's a good one.  All right.  There was a movie, a cartoon movie, that was made along with the album.  Okay.  Well, it's not Hell for Yellow Submarine.  Those are very old.  Hard Day's Night's old.  So that's with the? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  I know what it is.  Trinkets I own made from Gorilla Hands.  You can get it on eatabullet.com.  What are you talking about?  That's the new Jim Norton CD.  Oh, that was a big song.  Okay.  He fell into his trap.  Oh, God.  Anthony, what is it?  Write it down.  He knows what it is.  A cartoon made.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, damn.  I should have known that.  Come on now.  That was a good hint.  That makes sense.  Yeah, very good hint.  Okay.  Very easy to get hint, but.  What time do you have to go on the air?  I figured you guys, come on. 
[01:46:00]  I've got to give you.  What time do you have to go on the air?  At nine.  All right.  At nine-oh-one.  Cool.  So we don't wreck her buzz.  I will say that all in all, it's an excellent channel.  The 70s is phenomenal.  I love it.  I listen to it.  We have so much fun at the 70s.  Honestly.  Donny Osmond.  Okay.  How much fun was Donny Osmond?  I brought my Donny doll, and he signed the back with it.  When she was a little girl, she had this Donny Osmond doll, and she brought it with  her.  It was awesome.  When did he come in?  Still dressed in purple.  Yeah.  On last Monday, like the night.  I tell you, I know a lot about Donny Osmond. 
[01:46:30]  I think you do, too.  He's a great guy.  We don't need no education about Donny Osmond.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Let's get back to Dee Dee and the news and the story about young lust.  I've got to go.  Can I have my coffee?  Someone told me I can't have my coffee until I've had my banana.  How could you have your coffee when you haven't finished your banana?  All right.  All right.  I'm going to have to go now, kid. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  All right.  So it was great seeing you.  I'll see you in New York sometime.  Nice seeing you, too.  Do you hate it?  No.  What time are you on?  All right.  Nine.  Nine till when?  Nine Eastern.  Nine till when?  Till one.  Nine to one.  Eastern time.  On the 70s.  On the 70s on seven.  So check that out.  Could you give us a shout-out today?  Of course I will.  That would be nice.  We'll even pot it up on our show.  We'd like to do that.  We had the Mad Mexican do that.  We haven't seen him.  I think he got pissed off because we made fun of his dog.  Oh.  Chicago?  Is he here?  His dog's Chicago.  The one at his death? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  We hate his dog.  No.  And someone around here has to tell him enough about the dog.  We'll be able to kick it in the liver.  He walks around with a Chicago hat on, a Chicago t-shirt.  He's a big Chicago fan.  Yeah, that's what we thought, but he's like, no, that's the name of my dog.  Well, because he's a fan of the band.  Oh, so he didn't tell us that.  And that's why he named the dog that.  So he's a fan of the band first and then named, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he didn't tell us that part of the story.  He just shows us pictures of his dog.  Ugh, I want to kick it in the liver. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, that's just wrong.  That's not nice to do.  Yeah, you're right.  So you have to go on the air.  Yeah, all right.  All right, we'll let you be.  Hey, Sari, leave this show alone.  Does he think he's funny?  Honest to God.  It's funny, Toss, though.  Okay, well.  All righty.  Thank you, Sari.  Thank you.  Have fun with that countdown.  All right, it'll be fun.  4 p.m. on the East, 1 p.m. on the West, Friday.  And then we're going to repeat it throughout the weekend through Memorial Day. 
[01:48:30]  I'll definitely take a peek.  I'll be there.  4 million.  Woo-woo!  I'll be there.  I was here when we had none.  None?  None.  None more?  None.  We had zero.  Zero listeners.  So you turned on the mic and just knew no one was listening?  Yeah.  That was so wild.  I was the first woman hired in the programming department here.  Wow.  So I've been here before the rocket ships launched, and they're giving us maps of the floors around  here.  Yeah.  And they're walking us around with hard hats, and they're saying, oh, this is going to be  so cool.  The studio's going to be here.  You're going to be able to go coast to coast.  The studio's going to be here.  But there was, like, you couldn't even walk around without, like, closed-toe shoes around 
[01:49:00]  here.  Really?  You were, like, the first one in, like, a chat room, just waiting for other people to  join.  Like, come on.  Do you play Sabbath at all on your station?  Not a lot of Sabbath, because it wasn't, you know, big hits.  But I am going to play it during the Top 70 albums, because, like, Paranoid, and, you  know, we're going to play War Pigs, and, yeah, you'll hear stuff like that.  You'll hear really cool cuts, because we're going to play cuts from all the albums.  Play Electric Funeral.  Better.  Okay.  I'm just saying. 
[01:49:30]  He kind of likes Ozzy.  For you.  Yeah.  Sari doesn't know how to deal with us.  We're just...  I love her channel, though.  It's phenomenal.  Yeah, we're just a room full of idiots in here, so...  Well, as long as you love the 70s.  Definitely.  Awesome.  Awesome.  All right.  Thank you, Sari.  All right.  Take care of you guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Ah, that's funny.  Should we take a break and then continue with Dee Dee's News, or...  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Just...  You are the worst.  You are horrid. 
[01:50:00]  Did she look?  Yeah.  Did she look?  My good line got stepped on.  I'm kind of...  What happened?  What happened?  I had a really good one, I thought.  Oh, what was it?  It was, you know, going down the same road you guys did.  What?  Oh, I was trying to get back to Dee Dee's News and the story about Young Lust with Michael  Jackson, and it didn't really get a laugh, and now I'm sitting here all bummed.  What did you say?  What did you say?  I just said it again.  Young...  The Young Lust. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's kind of hard to...  I think...  A little obscure.  I know.  But someone out there probably would have laughed.  I'm sure.  I would have felt good about myself instead of sitting here feeling like I'm a dork.  Why would you feel like a dork?  You'd fire out an obscure one.  The obscure ones are hard to get sometimes.  I'd fire one out before.  Not only did it not get a laugh, no one recognized that a joke had been attempted.  Yeah, that's rough.  All right, why don't we take a quick break?  Is this a quick break or a long break?  Hopefully a quick one.  Quick break.  And then we'll finish with the news with Dee Dee.  How many more stories you got? 
[01:51:00]  Just a couple, and then I'll have some more later.  Do you got the bus driver story?  No, I got something better.  Ooh.  Do you have the banana story?  No, I have something better.  That's a good one.  Something pertaining to Paris.  Oh, okay.  I am going to challenge you for best story.  Oh, Jesus.  What is your best story there?  Well, I think...  That's a teaser.  Let's wait until we come back to the commercial.  I'd like to hear what she thinks.  The Paris story.  Okay, there you go again with the inks. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, come on.  All right, you pick out your best story, and I'm going to pick out my best story.  All right, I got it.  Is it coming from Australia?  No, it's not coming from Australia.  Australia.  That was another one.  And we spank Dee Dee next.  That's what we're going to do.  And then we do this.  She hates that.  No, it's funny looking at his tongue wiggle like that.  Oh, she doesn't hate it.  Not funny looking when you're looking down over your stomach at it.  That's right.  That's right.  And just ask me.  That's right.  And you don't want to feel good or be scared of that gun barrel pointing at you. 
[01:52:00]  We're just a bunch of Beavis and Buttheads in here.  All right.  Yep.  Who's taking my cues today to go to break?  Is it you or back in New York?  So I just say something like, we'll be back right after these messages.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The O.B.  Anthony Show.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  It's real, the pain you feel.  You trust, you match, you match.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? 
[01:53:00]  I really want to know.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I really want to know who would think that it doesn't look good to have white grease on this.  And now they're creaky.  Very creaky, the mic booms.  Like, who's walking through the hallway way out there and going to look in and go,  white stuff on there?  White grease.  I don't get it.  Well, it's a bunch of very sensitive people that work here. 
[01:53:30]  But, I mean, there's a real reason for it.  I mean, you know, when you move the mic, it shouldn't make noise.  I'm not trying to be a dick.  I just don't want to.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to do this the whole show.  So, you know.  Sounds like you're farting.  I like it.  Exactly.  Fighting.  Fighting.  What did you say to me?  I said it sounds like you were farting.  I am not farting.  Fighting.  Dee Dee just rocks.  We love Dee Dee.  And I'm not starting trouble.  And she looks at your shirt and goes, look, it says I stink. 
[01:54:00]  I stink.  It does.  Jim's wearing his I stink t-shirt, which is perfect for today because Dee Dee has a tough  time saying the I in.  I stink.  Stink.  Ink.  What is wrong with the way I'm saying it?  Say it again.  Ink.  Exactly.  Say ink.  Stink.  Stink.  Ink.  Ink.  Link.  Link.  Link.  Yeah, you forget there's an I.  Put E in it.  All right, Anthony, we found the Burt Reynolds audio for you.  All right.  So basically, once again, he was at the premiere for Longest Yard, I guess? 
[01:54:30]  Longest Yard.  And a reporter asked him some questions, and Burt Reynolds basically said, you don't even  know what the movie is about, or you didn't see the movie or something like that?  Yeah.  And then Burt got a little upset, I guess, and kind of punched him in the, or slapped  him in the face.  I wonder what that is.  The Mad Mexican.  It's really loud, though.  How'd that happen?  Wow, is that loud?  Oh, okay. 
[01:55:00]  There we go.  What does this mean?  Oh, this is like his, uh, that came from New York?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, the Mad Mexican, every time we're in Washington, he gives us a little shout-out  in Spanish, and you can only recognize Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton's name.  Uh-huh.  And they just blasted the feed really loud into our ears and over the air, so I think  we just blasted out some units.  Wow, I'm sure.  That was one of the loudest things I've ever heard in my headphones.  But who in New York just put that through?  Like, I don't understand what happened.  Out of nowhere.  Oh, okay. 
[01:55:30]  Well, they're just trying to feed it down to us, so I don't know.  Uh-oh.  What does this mean?  I don't know.  9-11, he'll be giving us a shout-out.  Oh, okay.  Six minutes left.  Yeah.  Can't listen to that for six minutes.  You'll put it back on, it'll be the exact same sounding song.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, anyway, the Burt Reynolds.  Yeah, so some CBS reporter was asking him questions, I guess, and he hadn't seen the movie. 
[01:56:00]  And Burt got a little upset with the fact that he hadn't seen the movie, I guess, and  slapped him in the face.  Okay.  But they're saying that he was just kidding.  You know, Burt's a pretty physical guy.  Even though he's 69 years old, he's still acting like he's that bruiser of the days gone  by.  And, um, no, it seems to have made the news.  And you saw the video?  I have not seen the video yet.  Oh, okay.  I want to see this video.  It's on CBS.  All right, here we go.  Here's the audio of what happened.  A red carpet interview with Burt Reynolds took an unexpected turn when the actor slapped 
[01:56:30]  a CBS producer in the face.  Tell us anything about the movie.  You don't know anything about the movie?  Yes, I do.  Well, then, what the fuck are you asking?  I want to get you to the movie.  You see the original?  I haven't.  I haven't.  I haven't heard of it.  It happened last night at the premiere of Reynolds' new movie, The Longest Yard.  Reynolds' publicist claims, quote, he playfully tapped him on the cheek.  That sounded loud.  I was kidding.  It was really hard to hear, but... 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, but I heard the slap.  You could hear the slap part.  That didn't sound like a playful tap on the cheek.  No.  It sounded like you heard Burt Reynolds go, you didn't see the movie?  Yeah.  And then, boom.  That sounded like Lonnie put on too much rouge or eyeliner.  Gotta smack that off her face.  Who do you think I am, Mr. Carlson whore?  All right, let's get back to Dee Dee and the news here.  Dee Dee, what else do you have?  All right.  I...  I have my favorite story. 
[01:57:30]  But you're going to end with that.  Oh, okay, okay.  Then in Michigan City, Indiana...  Oh, well, no, I mean, do you have other stories before your favorite story?  Yeah, yeah, I have the...  All right, you'll end with that.  That'll be the last thing you do.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  And we'll see who has the better story.  I got one in front of me as well.  All right.  In Michigan City, Indiana, a convicted murderer who sought a reprieve so he could donate part  of his liver to his alien sister was executed earlier this morning.  What?  This morning.  This morning.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy was trying to delay his execution by saying he wanted to donate his liver to 
[01:58:00]  his sister, right?  Yeah.  Good boy.  Gregory Scott Johnson was executed at 12.28 a.m. for beating and stomping an 82-year-old  woman to death.  Dee Dee, that's not funny.  I didn't laugh.  Then setting her house on fire to like the crime.  Dee Dee.  I'm laughing because you're doing, you know, things in my country.  How can you laugh at the old woman?  I'm not laughing at the old woman.  I'm laughing at him putting in last thing.  What happened to the old woman again?  She died. 
[01:58:30]  Of what?  He was beating and stomping her.  Dee Dee!  Yeah!  Stop.  I'm not doing anything.  Somebody's doing something.  That's awful.  Okay.  Well, Governor Mitch Daniels rejected Johnson's request for reprieve Tuesday.  However, he did say he accepted the sincerity of Johnson's motivation in trying to donate  part of his liver, but that medical experts had advised against it.  Johnson's 48-year-old sister suffers from non-alcoholic cirrhosis. 
[01:59:00]  Non-alcoholic.  Stop doing that.  That makes me laugh.  We're not doing anything.  What is wrong with you today?  Why do you think your sister's illness was funny?  I didn't say it was funny, but I heard a laugh in my headphones.  That thing.  What thing?  Okay, never mind.  All right.  The governor's office released a letter Daniels received from two doctors stating that because 
[01:59:30]  of the presence of the hepatitis B antibody in his heavy body weight, he was unsuitable  as a donor.  Are you going to do this story all day?  No, okay, I'm done.  He's all fat with hepatitis trying to give his liver away?  He didn't beat the old lady to death.  He fell on her.  Oh, no, he was beating and stomping her.  All right.  Well, I have my favorite news story, so.  I'm sure she was aggravating anyway at that age.  Oh, quit hitting me.  It's chilly in here.  Oh.  Do you feel damp? 
[02:00:00]  Stop.  That's me.  The neighbors are loud.  Let me tell you about how much my medicine costs.  Oh, beat her.  That's right.  Fist into the teeth.  Brent was a nickel.  Frap.  Brent was a nickel.  I think we have some AP audio from that story, too.  Okay.  He wanted to donate a piece of his liver to his sister, who has cirrhosis. 
[02:00:30]  He had asked the Indiana Parole Board and the governor of Indiana permission to do this,  which would have caused them to delay the death penalty.  Yeah.  All right.  We know that part.  The parole board recommended that the governor not grant him the extra time to donate the liver.  And the governor accepted that recommendation, saying that he had been advised by medical personnel.  The liver was not needed.  That split liver donations are not done very often here in Indiana.  His sister would probably be better off with a full liver donated by somebody else. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  You don't need your stinky liver.  All right.  So they execute him.  Stinky.  So he's dead.  Stinky, yeah.  Yeah.  Stinky liver.  Stinky liver.  Well, I'm ready for my favorite story.  Oh, who are you?  But we've got to wait for Man Mexican, though, right?  Wow.  Definitely.  Oh, DeeDee's running the show now.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm just guessing because you said that.  DeeDee's show.  Yeah.  We don't want to get in DeeDee's way.  Hey, welcome to the DeeDee show.  Well, let's all just step aside, DeeDee. 
[02:01:30]  No, you said 9-11 and look at the clock.  You're right.  I'm just going by the clock.  Well, it's 9-10.  Now we've got to waste 50 seconds.  Well, whatever the producer says.  All right, DeeDee.  The D&D virus is spreading.  Why don't you just fill for 40 seconds?  Go ahead, DeeDee.  It's your show now.  It's all about you.  No, it's not all about me.  I was just looking at the clock.  Feeling a little comfortable with the boys, are you?  Yeah.  No.  So how are you guys doing?  Good.  Thanks for having us.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  What are you guys going to do for Memorial Weekend?  Ooh.  That's a good question.  A thought starter.  That is a thought starter, but you know how the Man Mexican is going to start in 15 seconds?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're obsessed with him.  I like him.  He's a cool guy.  He stinks.  Isn't this the same song?  Of course it is.  He started at 6.40.  Freddie Fender albums.  Holy Scott.  Well, it's now 9-11, DeeDee.  Funny.  Is this new or is it the Chico and the Man sound?  Sound. 
[02:02:30]  Maybe theme song would have been funnier.  Sound?  The Chico and the Man sound.  What, a gunshot?  Oh, did you save that bomb?  It's okay, DeeDee.  It's all right.  I'm sorry.  Let me turn off the teletype and we'll get ready for the Man Mexican.  Just like a Mexican, he's late.  Oh!  That's a...  Whoa.  Hey, what is that?  What kind of talk is that?  I know.  I apologize.  I was just trying to squeeze a few extra songs into his show. 
[02:03:00]  Oh.  Sounds like the answer.  That was great.  I didn't get it.  Here we go.  Juan Sebastián, llamarle a Cúpido.  Yeah, put a rubber on Cupid, why don't you?  Okay, do something about those arrows or something.  Oh, by the way, quiero mandar saludos los bienvenidos otra vez a Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, el comedian famoso Jim Norton se encuentran aquí in Washington, D.C.  Van a estar aquí hoy y mañana, XM202, XM202, alta voltaje, it's high voltage. 
[02:03:30]  Están aquí las 7 hasta las 11 de la mañana y tiempo este.  Okay, en el oeste, 4 hasta las 8.  So, check it out.  It's locura of the highest order.  And it just so happens that we're here hoy y mañana, XM202, XM202, high voltage with  Opie and Anthony.  And in honor of O&A and Jim Norton, things are heating up.  Fuego!  Yeah, we love Fuego! 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, Fuego!  We love the Fuego.  He starts the show every morning with Fuego, right?  Yeah, this thing rocks.  We need guns.  How cool is the Mad Mexican?  Yeah.  Gotta love him.  There he goes, the Mad Mexican.  I don't understand a word of it.  I hear, jelly bean jar, but I don't have a hammer to the skull. 
[02:04:30]  Into my van, bitch.  That's what you hear.  Oh, these are nice jelly beans.  Now, I wish I could think of a Christmas song.  I couldn't think of Christmas music.  Damn it, you almost had it.  I almost had it, but I realized as I was saying it.  I don't know, I always just go, silent night.  You're right.  Yeah, well.  But I wanted to do it right.  Yeah.  All right, Deedee.  What's your best story?  I'm challenging you here. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  The Parents Television Council strikes again.  Oh, we love them.  Yeah, this time targeting hamburger chain Carl's Jr.  The company's-  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Yeah, I didn't-  Okay, whatever.  Hamburger.  The company's new television commercial for its new spicy burger features Paris Hilton.  Hamburger.  Uh-huh.  The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.  That was really funny on the replay last night.  All right.  A movie about-  What did she say? 
[02:05:30]  Drugs, killing, and hamburgers.  Oh, Francine.  Profoundly retarded.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry, Deedee.  No, that's okay.  I was looking at you.  Paris Hilton, yeah.  So she's, um, basically it features her in a tight-fitting swimsuit, soaping up a Bentley,  and crawling all over it before taking a big bite out of the burger.  Hmm.  And Melissa Caldwell, research director for the PTC, says this commercial is basically 
[02:06:00]  softcore porn.  They say she moves the way she puts her finger in her mouth.  It suggests-  It's suggestive and very, uh, titillating?  Unbelievable.  Titillating.  He's going to kill me.  Wait, get him in here.  He's going to kill me.  Here, the Mad Mexican.  Obviously he has nothing to do on his show.  Hey, beware of Mad Mexican's band Gifts.  This is yours.  That's Fuego.  Ah, thank you.  I got a copy for you guys, too.  Thank you. 
[02:06:30]  We all love the Fuego.  Thank you, Mad Mexican.  Thank you, Mad Mexican.  What's the song you start with?  Fuego is the one.  Fuego?  Yeah.  Okay.  Fuego is the one.  All right.  Very nice.  That's great.  That's great when I played for you.  We love the Fuego.  Yeah, of course.  I'm proud of you.  Who will?  What are you doing on your show today?  We're just offending the masses, as we usually do.  Yeah.  Thank you for the plug.  It was very nice.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  What do you got on that?  We were listening.  It was crazy, but we're not a reason.  It's a little dog.  You got another?  Do you have a puppy called New York?  No, this is the Yankees. 
[02:07:00]  I've been a Yankee fan since I was six, and it was rough last year.  It's rough this year.  Well, although they're...  Yeah, they're starting to play considerably better.  I'm going to lie.  I hate this Yankee.  I'm a Yankee fan.  I hate Kevin Brown.  I hate his guts.  I can't root for him.  I can't root for Randy Johnson, either.  I hate them both.  I got no quarrels with a man.  He goes out, does a job, gets his gazillion dollars, and goes on about his list.  He's above...  Kevin Brown is great in June against the A's, or he's fantastic against the Cubs, maybe, 
[02:07:30]  or we don't play the Cubs.  Hey, what's your problem, man?  That's not going to get me fired, is it?  No.  Oh, okay.  I just thought I'd ask.  I just don't like...  Oh, you're opening your CD.  It's Wago!  It's Wago.  The room is on fire.  How is Chicago?  He's doing fine.  He's doing good.  He's calling my palatial estate as we speak.  I hope he was wondering.  I hope he's very fond of this dog.  Yes, I am.  I love Chicago, that little rascal.  He's doing great, man.  You know, he's doing all right. 
[02:08:00]  He takes care of me.  I take care of him.  We kind of made a deal.  What kind of dog is he?  He's a Lhasa Apso.  What's that?  One of those Chinese dogs from Tibet.  Tibetan dogs.  I thought he was a big dog.  Oh, no.  He's one of these little guys.  He goes, that's Chicago?  I go, come on.  They thought I was having a Rottweiler or something.  Yeah, a little rat dog.  It's a little dog, but I will say this.  He's a chick magnet.  Oh, really?  They attract this guy like you would not believe.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  It's great.  So you walk around Chicago?  Oh, yeah, sure.  I take Chicago around, and oh, chicks love him. 
[02:08:30]  They really do.  They call them one hand to me.  Are you getting with chloroform in the other hand?  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  That's me.  It was either that or a ball-peen hammer, so I had to use something more inconspicuous.  You don't yank that reference out of thin air.  No, none whatsoever.  I do have experience in the ball-peen hammer business.  Gentlemen, I'm going to have to go back and offend the masses.  All right.  Welcome back to D.C.  I'll talk to you guys about that.  Could you play some Freddy Fender?  Okay.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Play some Freddy Fender. 
[02:09:00]  I grew up in San Benito in South Texas.  I knew Freddy Fender, as a matter of fact.  Really?  His neighborhood, yes, over in San Benito, and it's called El Jardin, which means the  Jardin.  You're right.  Okay, that's Spanish for the Jardin.  Of course.  I have no idea what that means.  Okay, that's true.  And we care why.  Poe, Poe, if you're listening, how fast could you get to D.C.?  It's getting hot in here.  It certainly is.  Fuego.  Gentlemen, good to see you.  Welcome back to D.C.  Talk to you soon.  Fuego.  Van Mexican.  There he goes. 
[02:09:30]  And this is what's going on.  Oh, jeez, you nailed him.  I love this.  This is his show, as he's on our show.  Just on autopilot.  Autopilot.  All right.  All right, DeeDee, so are you done?  No, no, no, no, no, because Carl Jr.'s CEO, Andy Pudster, says to...  Andy Pudster?  P-U-Z-D-E-R, whatever.  Oh, I thought it was Pudster.  Now, what did Carl say?  He said for that lady to, you know, get a life.  This isn't a Janet Jackson.  There's no nipple in this.  There's no nudity. 
[02:10:00]  There's no sex acts.  It's just a beautiful model in a swimsuit.  Did he say get a life?  Yeah, he said get a life.  What harsh terms.  He said get a life, because there's no nipple in it.  There's no Carl's Jr.'s around here, is there?  No, I don't think so, is there?  Like a West Coast thing?  Yeah.  What is the app?  Carl's Jr.?  What do you see at Carl's Jr.?  Carl's.  It's a burger place.  Carl's Jr.  So that's your best story?  I thought it was funny, but no, you know what?  Later I have a hot teen story.  Oh.  Hot teen story.  But I'm saving that for the list.  Oh. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, wait, you got no traffic today?  No, no.  They let her work for us when we're down here.  Because it's just too much.  You don't understand.  There's a lot of traffic.  Who's taking care of Texas?  Beth is today.  All right.  All right.  Here's my best story of the day, Anthony.  It's not as hot as...  Well, it depends who you are, I guess.  Ooh.  Ex-cop banana flasher jailed.  I didn't see this one.  I got you beat already.  Okay.  A former Stanford, Connecticut police officer has been sentenced to 20 days in jail for  lewdly flashing women with a toy banana on a main Greenwich Avenue. 
[02:11:00]  Uh, Arthur Bertana, 63, who had been on probation for lewd conduct in Stanford more than four  years ago, was ordered to serve the term for placing the banana in his pants and then  exposing the bolts to women in a sexually offensive manner.  So he wouldn't even, like, hang it out.  Like Jimmy's doing right now.  Well, Jimmy's got a banana down his pants.  Oh, no, I don't.  Oh, God.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, that's the real deal, DeeDee.  What do you think?  No, no.  I saw there were two bananas there. 
[02:11:30]  There were two.  Hold on.  Okay.  I can't twist it.  What, can't you get it in place?  No, I'm trying to get it on the right side, but how do you keep it from falling down?  That looks good, though.  You want to walk around with a banana in your pants like that?  Yeah.  I actually just want to squeeze it and have yellow stuff shoot through my pants.  Tell girls I've been ill.  Sorry.  Let's get back from Rio.  It was a yellow plush child's toy banana, the sergeant said.  Oh.  And it had a smiley face on it.  Of course it did.  That's pretty funny, man. 
[02:12:00]  And he put it down his pants, and then he wouldn't whip it out or anything, but he would just  kind of like maybe pull his jacket aside or his shirt or something.  And kind of grab it and go, hey, look at this.  And you put one leg forward and cock your hip, if I may use the term.  Should he get 20 days for that, though?  No.  For then showing, like, hey, check the...  What is he?  Look at the girl in the eyes and then look down at his dick and go, hey, uh, uh, check it  out.  You should get a weekend or so for just being silly.  That is just silly.  He's been arrested before, though.  I think he finally...  Different fruit.  First time it was just grapes. 
[02:12:30]  What's he waiting for?  That's not working.  Uh, something phallic that would help.  Ben was doing orange.  Ben was doing the same thing.  He would just use a cantaloupe.  Ben's actually been arrested for it.  He had to show, no, that's just the way I am.  Right.  All right, boy, get that watermelon back immediately.  Don't lie, don't lie, don't lie, there's nothing in my pants.  Look, I have no fruit.  Oh, D.D., you rock.  We love you.  No, you rock.  We're going to have you back at, uh, let's call it, uh, right around 10 or just before.  We'll give you a half hour to get some, uh, new, uh, stories together, okay? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Hey, we got some, uh, I mean, you can hang if you want.  We're going to do a couple of these psycho ex-girlfriend remixes that are coming in, Anthony.  Yeah, a lot of those.  Before the break.  Remixes.  There's a lot of people, uh, being very motivated.  Hey, it's an autographed picture of the Mad Mexican and Chicago.  Oh, wow.  We got to bring this back to New York.  It says, best wishes, ONA and Jim.  It says, uh, the Mad Mexican and then Chicago.  He's pointing to Chicago.  Oh, that's a little dog.  This dog is adorable. 
[02:13:30]  Isn't it, Anthony?  Look at that.  What a cute dog.  Isn't that nice?  Aw, look at the little white face.  He's got, like, a little, uh, white face.  No, you didn't.  Jesus Christ.  He ripped it off.  Opie.  Opie.  That's wrong.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Little, little white dog.  Is he out there?  Oh, my God.  You know, even I, and I've been, I've been, uh, with Opie on the air now for, uh, just 
[02:14:00]  about, uh, like, ten years.  Ten years.  Even I didn't see that coming.  I swear to you, I did not think you would do that.  Oh, my God.  He took the time to write Chicago with a little arrow.  With an arrow.  He took his cute little dog.  You are a prick.  Oh.  You are a prick.  Little dog all happy.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  Like, can you get another one, please?  Yeah.  Please get another one.  Just tell him something happened.  We spilled coffee on it.  Oh, yeah, that's a good one.  Tell him we spilled, we spilled some Opie on it.  Yeah.  You are awful, man.  The guy, oh.  We'll get another one.  Oh, that makes me so happy.  Where do you get the other one?  You are really not right.  Yeah, we'll get another one.  Something happened.  Carlo, bring me a side picture.  Something happened here. 
[02:15:00]  That is more of a visual.  Yeah.  Because you just see everyone's faces just get really...  But that comes through audio very well.  That rip was pretty distinct.  People knew what was going on.  No one thought that was a newspaper.  All right.  Well, Anthony.  Hey, this is a really nice picture.  Look at the dog.  All right.  I wonder what he's doing.  Anthony, we've got more Psycho Ex-Girlfriend remixes.  We're getting new listeners every day.  You want to explain the Psycho Ex-Girlfriend phone calls really fast first? 
[02:15:30]  Tapes that were on the internet a while back.  It's a guy.  Had a girl.  They were together for only a few months.  And I guess he decided to break up with her.  Maybe even just started treating her like crap, trying to get her to break up with him.  But obviously the relationship was done with.  And she called and left plenty of messages.  I think 50 or so.  Yeah.  On his phone, he took them.  And instead of calling her back and being all nice and sweet like she wanted him to be,  he put it on the internet. 
[02:16:00]  And we all get to hear it.  Right.  And then the listeners have started making remixes.  What's wrong, Timmy?  You are so bad, man.  I knew it was a bad move.  As soon as I saw the picture, it turned sideways.  I'm like, yeah.  I think I'm going to be around for a while.  Yeah.  It turned sideways and it was over.  It is the cutest publicity shot ever, too.  It really is.  Him holding a little dog.  He's all proud and stuff with his Chicago hat or shirt on, whatever.  Oh, it's adorable. 
[02:16:30]  Anyway, so the remixes have started to come in, Anthony.  And so far, I'd have to say they're just missing, but still kind of entertaining to listen to.  Oh, I thought you had something, Steve.  I'm sorry.  He's on his way back in.  Uh-oh.  You didn't tell him what happened, did you?  No.  I'm not that brave.  Are you afraid of him?  I don't know.  No, he's got kind of like a loco.  Loco.  Very good.  That's why you're using those terms.  A loco.  A loco look to him.  Loco. 
[02:17:00]  I've got to pee real quick.  I'll play the clip.  What?  You'll play the clip.  Well, we're all going to take a break soon, Jim.  Oh, okay.  Nice good tinkle.  Bill Lumberg.  Remix, Anthony.  Yeah.  From Office Space.  So this came in overnight.  It's from Chemistry.  Chemistry did this one?  Chemistry did this one.  Take a listen.  So, what's happening?  I'm done doing this thing with you, chasing you, until the part where you'd exhaust me.  Well, you have already.  Uh, I wasn't aware.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[02:17:30]  Mm, yeah.  Did you really want to see over?  Is that what you want?  Are you going to be a happy boy then?  Ah, yeah.  So, I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk.  Hmm?  I guess so.  That's what you told me.  So, I guess I should just listen to that.  Yeah.  If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great.  Call me back.  You better call me soon, because I'm done chasing you.  I can't express this to you enough. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  So, you know, if you want to, go ahead and, uh...  You know, sometimes you only do this so many times, and then it just becomes fucking old, doesn't it?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Um, I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there.  Yeah.  I'm going to bed, and I am certainly moving on tomorrow morning.  Goodbye.  Thanks.  Sage message. 
[02:18:30]  There you have it.  It's not bad, right, Ant?  Yeah.  I like the Lumberg, but he could have put it together a little better, I think.  Not bad.  All right.  That was from Chemistry.  The next one is from, uh, Nick and Rob from Long Island.  It's, uh, myself and the psycho ex-girlfriend getting together here.  What's up?  Well, we seem to have a little problem here, you and I.  What?  Apparently, you're stealing things out of my house now.  Oh, my God.  The heart crystal, the Swarovski crystal that was on my countertop. 
[02:19:00]  Where did, did you take that to?  I did not.  That wasn't yours.  My brother bought that for me, and now you're stealing things out of my home.  You're insane.  So, unless you want me to call the police and tell them that I need you to return the  stuff that you stole from my house, however small it might be, it was significant to me,  and I want that act.  Well, you've got to calm down a little bit.  And I don't know how many other things you stole from me.  So, we've got a little problem here.  Whatever.  If you think that you can do this to me, well, you've got a fucking other thing coming.  Oh, my God.  You said you weren't going to run away. 
[02:19:30]  What the hell did I do wrong this time?  I don't know, dickhead, because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface.  You are a fucking asshole.  You know what?  You can do it to me, but I can't do it to you.  Tough shit.  Nothing is ever stable to you, is it?  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  I just thought I'd let you know that I just found out that my father's going into the  hospital on Wednesday because he's already been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and he's  had cancerous cells removed twice before from surgery, and they found more. 
[02:20:00]  So, now he's going in, and we never know how bad it is or if it spreads until they go in  and operate.  So, that's Wednesday.  So, I just hope you fucking leave me alone, and don't fuck with me, because I've had enough.  Who cares?  That one had its moments, no? 
[02:20:30]  I like that one.  I like its moments.  You're laughing.  Hard to get happy after that.  Oh!  Hey, look who's back, the mad Mexican.  Mad Mexican.  What's going on, bro?  Wait, wait, I brought a smaller version of the one you spilled coffee on.  I don't know if you did it intentionally, or what?  No.  Oh, no, I didn't spill coffee.  I mean, yeah, I didn't, oh, no, it was, yeah, where, where, it's right there, it's  right, right on there.  Where is it?  You guys spilled coffee on me and touched me.  He spilled coffee on me.  Oh, no, no, no.  My dog's a nice guy.  Give him a break.  I got to tell you, that dog is adorable. 
[02:21:00]  I told you, he's a magnet for babes.  That's amazing.  I love it.  How many babes have you got over the door?  Uh, we want, we're in triple digits now.  Holy shit.  Nice.  She's got a potty mouth.  Well, we got a smaller version.  We got a smaller version of the picture, isn't it?  Yeah, that's true.  That's a smaller version of the picture.  It's a big version.  Jimmy, why don't you just keep that?  I'm going to.  Hold on to that picture.  Oh, I like that.  Can I, um, can I see the, uh.  No.  What?  I like it.  I like it. 
[02:21:30]  I like it.  Why don't you just light it up?  Let's just fuego it up.  Now that we're at, okay.  I like that.  Except the popcorn capter.  I like the studio.  I like the signature.  In the signature, you get the M, the same M as you'd use for MAD and for Mexican.  I kind of like that.  Oh, that's nice.  It's cool.  Oh, that's really adorable.  Can I see that?  I've been a MAD Mexican 30 years, man.  Come on.  It's such a small picture.  I'd really like to see it.  Okay, here it is.  How's this version?  Is that okay?  All right.  Why would you hand it over to me?  In front of everybody. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Well, gentlemen, I'm going to go back to offend the masses once again.  Hey, welcome to D.C.  Oh, thank you, MAD Mexican.  It's, uh, it's a pleasure.  And I'll be seeing you eventually, okay?  This is a cute little picture.  It's adorable.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, geez, he turned around.  You're...  That is not to go to Opie.  No.  Especially when he's still in the...  We've got to scotch tape the other one back together.  We are.  And then, uh, take a picture for the website. 
[02:22:30]  You're horrible, man.  Just hanging up in the studio after we leave today.  All right, man.  We should take a break.  Yes.  So, the Psycho Ex-Girlfriend remixes are coming in.  You like that one, kind of?  That one was good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Really sounded like you were, uh, getting the phone call.  Anthony, we've got to get, uh, to some old business after the break.  Old business?  We were talking about Alan Sniffen.  Well, he had an MP3 audio response that we were talking about yesterday.  And, uh, on the New York Radio Message Board, um, all of, uh, the people that have responded, 
[02:23:00]  uh, are just clamoring, saying Alan did a great job.  He kicked our asses and showed us, uh, you know, beat us at our own game, they're saying.  All of his fans have rallied around him and said he did a great job with his audio response  to, uh, what we said.  Really?  The news guy being fired.  Somehow I doubt that.  Well, we'll see what it's all about next.  How's that sound?  All right.  All right.  Why don't we hit the, uh, little button there that gets us out of here?  But like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Why is it that I'm a weirdo for wrapping toilet paper around my finger to make myself, uh, like...  Well, because it's not your nostril.  Yeah, no, it's your ass.  No, why not just blow your nose?  Oh, I do.  I blow my nose, but sometimes it's just, uh, something hanging on there.  It's very sticky sometimes.  Jimmy, no offense.  I've never heard anyone else doing what you do.  I know, it's odd.  But I don't violate your ass with, uh, your own finger and toilet paper.  For the new listeners, he wraps a bunch of toilet paper around his one finger, his index 
[02:24:00]  finger, and he shoves it up.  Up to how far?  Knuckle?  Two knuckles?  You guys make it seem like I'm running and jamming it.  No, I just gently...  No, not just...  How high?  I don't know.  Maybe, uh, one or two knuckles.  Up to the watch?  How far do you go?  One or two?  Uh, one, dude.  Not two.  One.  One?  I think one's even weird, though, man.  One is a little weird.  I think it's a little weird, bro.  It is.  You should just...  You know, the surface is fine. 
[02:24:30]  You can get a good, you know, get a good cleanup going.  But you don't have to go up in there.  One foot on the seat, one on the floor, bend forward.  Like we were discussing last week, as long as the door is closed, you don't need to know  what's behind that door.  He's got a whole stance and everything.  One foot...  Wait a minute.  It's like a Heisman trophy.  On the toilet.  You get up off the toilet.  I stand.  You stand up.  Yeah.  Now you...  Hold on.  You can't stand. 
[02:25:00]  That messes up everything back there.  It mushes it back together.  No, can I stand?  It's kind of like the...  Hold on, hold on.  I got a quick thing.  All right.  It reminds me of, you know, painting as a kid.  And you have paint on one side, and then they make you fold the paper.  Oh, like a paint block.  Yeah, and then you open it up.  It's like, ah, wow, now that paint's over there.  You're doing a Rorschach test between your butt cheeks.  How did you know that was called a Rorschach test?  You don't know that?  No one knows that.  Rorschach didn't know they named it after him until he just heard you say it.  What I do is I stand up. 
[02:25:30]  Now, do you face the toilet?  You turn and face it and put one foot up on it?  That really depends on what the way...  I mean, you kind of have to kind of face the back a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I mean, I don't get backed by the septic tank like I'm Washington on the front of the boat.  Put one foot up and look forward.  Throw a nickel across the bathroom.  He has a toilet stool.  We've discussed that.  We've heard about his toilet stool.  In order to get a good dump, Jimmy has a little footstool that he puts his feet up on 
[02:26:00]  to help the clean up, right?  No, no, no.  No, while his feet are elevated, it's easier for him to...  It's better for your intestines.  It's a healthier position to be in.  It takes your feet off the floor about six to eight inches.  Yeah.  It just makes your insides bend up a bit.  So he's sitting there like he's in a mercury capsule.  Sometimes I'll put my hand on my chin and the other on my knee, and I look like the thinker.  But I get off the bowl.  I put my left foot on the floor. 
[02:26:30]  My right foot on the seat.  Oh, my God.  I lean forward.  Lean forward.  I reach back.  Oh, my God.  And the kid gets to work.  You know, that's the same stance, the same pose that's on the tampon boxes for girls to  insert the tampon.  There you go.  Yeah.  They put a leg up and then pop it in there.  So you're using that stance, only you bend over.  I'm a trainable.  You are a trainable.  Wow.  And how long have you done this?  My whole life.  Your whole entire life.  Yeah.  From the first time you remember wiping, you've stood up to wipe. 
[02:27:00]  O.P. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I'm a cowboy.  I'm a singer in black.  So throw a finger in the air.  Let me see where your rats stay.  Hey, hey.  Let me hear where your rats stay.  Hey, hey.  I'm giving it back.  So say.  Hey, hey.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  I'm a cowboy.  All right.  We're back with the O.A. virus spreading across America.  We're live from Washington, D.C. today and tomorrow. 
[02:27:30]  Having a lot of fun.  It is Whip-A-Mount Wednesday, by the way.  We should give that a plug real fast again.  It's a very simple, simple concept, Anthony.  You just get a wow in your car.  And if the girls feel like it, they're going to flash you when they see the wow.  It has happened for many, many years on this program.  Tell them, Fred.  And basically, to get involved, you just got to get a wow sticker on your car.  Or you can make a homemade wow sign.  And that supports the show.  And maybe, just maybe, you'll see some boobs like other people have over the years. 
[02:28:00]  You can get your wow stickers by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to our studio in New York City.  That address is up on opiananthony.com.  Okay?  Right for your wow stickers.  We were going to go to the Alan Sniffen thing.  But I think we have an update on Beth.  Remember Beth from Seattle?  Hmm.  Let me think.  No.  Do you?  You really should remember Beth.  Anyone?  Beth from Seattle.  Why should I?  I do know that name.  Hot Lesbo Jim Shower Story Girl.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Uh-huh.  The girl, she had the older woman who kind of seduced her in the, uh...  Right.  Now I'm remembering.  And the girl that went down on her, kneeling in the shower.  On the...  Flip-flops.  It was like her first lesbian experience.  She was working out late at night or something.  Yeah.  And she was in the shower.  And all of a sudden, this girl came on to her.  And they ended up in the shower.  Yeah.  And the fun ensued.  Yeah.  Let's, uh, say hi to Beth in Seattle.  Beth?  Hi.  What's going on, Beth?  Hello.  Nothing much.  I thought I'd give you guys a call to let you know the update on that story. 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  Why are you moaning?  There's an update?  Yeah.  Just this morning.  You sound all hot.  What?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was at the gym working out and I saw her there and, uh, I went into the locker room  after my workout and she was in there and I'm like a pussy.  I couldn't even, like, walk up and talk to her.  So I just kind of walked by her and kind of dropped my clothes on the floor and walked  into the shower, hoping that she would maybe follow me. 
[02:29:30]  And I was sitting there for, like, it felt like forever, just in the shower.  And I'm like, fuck, she's not going to come in.  I should just go out there and be like, hey, I like you.  Maybe we could hang out sometime.  And I'm sitting there trying to, like, talk myself up to go out there and she, like, rips  back the curtain and she's like, you are such a tease.  And, uh, we ended up making out on, you know, the little benches that are out by the 
[02:30:00]  lockers?  Yeah.  Like, oh my God.  Because the water was so hot that it was actually, like, burning.  Like, I don't know, there's something wrong with the way the water's working right now.  It's a gym.  We can't be in there for very long because it's, like, scalding hot.  So we were moved out onto the benches, you know, those plastic benches.  And I, uh, I did go down on her this time.  So, and I got her number.  So.  Oh, really?  Guys know that I, uh, actually got a little gumption and asked her. 
[02:30:30]  So, you know.  Good for you.  Wow.  That's a nice little scenario.  So you ate a little box, huh?  Yeah.  Way to put it.  I'm sorry.  Really made it romantic.  I know.  It's nice.  Took everyone out of the game.  So you ate her box?  Yeah.  So you got a face full of goo, did you?  That's nice.  Did it stink?  It stink.  It stink. 
[02:31:00]  Did she do anything to you?  Yeah, actually.  I mean, she went down on me and, um, uh, yeah.  She, uh, man, like, she has the greatest hands.  I can't even describe them.  They're, like, elegant and small.  Fingers and applause.  And, like, the way they, Ronald, I can't even, like, ugh, just thinking about it now.  And, like, the way she would just touch me and, hmm.  But, uh, yeah, she went down on me and she fingered me for a while. 
[02:31:30]  And, uh, we, I mean, we barely got away with it because we heard someone walking in.  And I ran into the shower.  And she started changing.  And when I came back out, she kissed me and gave me her phone number.  And she said we should hang out sometime.  So, do you understand right now the inside of my boxers looks like the bottom of a cereal bowl when you're finished?  Well, I'm glad I could help out with that, Jimmy. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, Beth, you're the best.  Did this happen this morning?  Yeah, just a couple hours ago.  Well, and you're in Seattle.  So, what are we talking, like, uh, six in the morning or so?  It was two in the morning, I think.  And I was done.  Well, I just got back from the gym and I went for a jog.  And then I thought I'd give you guys a call and let you know what's going on.  You sound like you're still, uh, bothered and worked up.  Oh, I am, but I'm also really tired.  Where are you right now? 
[02:32:30]  I'm in my bed in my apartment.  Hmm.  Crossing my fingers right now, by the way.  Um, Beth.  Yeah?  It's just, you know, it's just me and Anthony and Jimmy.  There's no one else really listening.  And you sound kind of like you need to, I don't know, release.  What do you say?  Uh, you know, I've only been listening to you guys for a couple of months, but I really like you.  But, um... 
[02:33:00]  Oh, my God, you barely know the girl that ate your box at the gym.  What's the difference?  Well, she's cuter than you guys, so...  That's not saying much.  All right.  Well, just picture me with a blonde wig and...  Keep talking.  Have you seen the photoshops?  Yeah.  You don't have to picture so much.  They've done that.  They've done it.  They've done it all with our faces.  Picture me with my arms above my head and that little delicious V showing from under my shirt.  I think you should picture me with the Photoshop of my head on Brad Pitt's body. 
[02:33:30]  I think that one's out there as well.  Yeah, with, like, girl hair.  Right.  I actually saw pictures of you guys for the first time because I was looking up Open Anthony online.  And I have to congratulate you guys for not being big, fat fucks like all the other radio guys out there.  Oh.  Yeah, we're breaking the mold.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Beth, you know, we really have to try to make this happen.  The listeners are begging for it.  Are they?  Yeah, a little, you know, a little, I don't know. 
[02:34:00]  You got a little toy there, maybe?  Got any toys?  I do.  I have a couple toys.  All right.  What do you got?  But, you know, I'm so tired, but I guess...  All right, maybe.  Okay.  Yeah, grab a toy.  Let's get into it a little bit here.  No one's really listening.  Oh, God.  We're kind of having a bad show today.  I don't know.  They're listening to the 70s channel and the Mad Mexican and all other things today. 
[02:34:30]  Do you guys think that if I wasn't an exhibitionist, I would have called you guys in the first place?  Good point.  Good point, Beth.  Good point.  Are you naked?  No, I'm wearing little black underwear, little boy shorts.  But that's it.  That's what I hate.  Ooh, Beth.  Ooh, I invented girls' name, Beth.  I invented girls moaning on the radio.  All right.  And you're topless.  I'm trying to remember what your body looked like again.  I remember we were very happy at your description. 
[02:35:00]  I'm about 125.  I'm a swimmer.  5'5".  Short blonde hair.  Yeah, that's right.  Short blonde hair.  She's a swimmer and a diver.  All right.  It sounds like you might be starting out here.  Yeah, of course you are.  I don't know if I can come on the radio. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know if I can come on the radio.  Oh 
[02:36:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[02:36:30]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Say something to put me over, Jim. 
[02:37:00]  I'm going to help you go over.  All right, I'm laying back.  I have plastic on the floor. 
[02:37:30]  Drop it on me.  No, you ass!  It was right there.  We had her, you ass!  Oh, fuck, it's an idiot.  You're a fucking idiot.  Oh, fuck, it's an idiot.  I'm sorry, I ruined it.  Asshole!  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole. 
[02:38:00]  I love you guys anyway.  Thank you, Beth.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism happens every time one of those dancers start poong-tanging around with those show-ful facts.  All right, I'm going to go to sleep now.  Bye, Beth.  You're directly unusual.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Is there a chance that you could finish up, or? 
[02:38:30]  I could.  Huh?  Did we wreck the moment?  She's faking me.  Oh, hey, wait a minute.  Dee Dee, who's running the show today, has entered the studio.  Dee Dee?  Yeah.  What do you mean she's faking it?  The boss just came in.  What?  Go ahead.  Dee Dee's in studio, Beth.  Her boss just came in?  I mean you as the boss.  Oh, I'm not a boss.  I'm just saying she's faking it.  How do you know she's faking it?  Hi, Dee Dee.  Hi.  Beth is our hot chick from Seattle that likes to have sex with older women in gym showers. 
[02:39:00]  Faking it?  What do you mean?  How do you know she's faking it?  It just sounds like she's faking it.  Well, no shit.  I am seducting.  I usually come very quietly, which I don't think would be very entertaining.  Oh, so you were just giving a little oof.  No, they like it loud.  Huh?  Yeah, we do like it loud.  They like it loud.  Yeah, we're going to spank Dee Dee.  Beth, we're going to spank Dee Dee in a little while.  Yeah.  So you're going to want to listen to the replay after you wake up from your nap.  And I may hit Dee Dee with my oatmeal and knock on conscious. 
[02:39:30]  I want to thank work for bringing this.  It's really cool to have oatmeal with no fluid in it at all.  Look at that.  Jesus Christ.  Did you pull this out of a skull?  What is this?  Who made it?  Usually you don't want too much liquid in your oatmeal, but listen.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  That is devoid of moisture.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You've got the same mixture over here.  This is good for breakfast and tile grouting. 
[02:40:00]  All right, Beth.  It's like tuna fish.  You left us hanging a little bit, but you're going to have to call back soon, and we'll let  you finish, okay?  Okay.  I'll talk to you guys later.  We have audio from inside the locker room.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Open your mouth.  They're paying for it.  You'll eat it.  I'll talk to you guys later, bud. 
[02:40:30]  All right, Beth.  All right, Beth.  Hoo-hoo.  Bye.  Hoo-hoo.  Love that name.  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  Someone's suggesting that Dee Dee and Beth have phone sex.  No.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Would you do it?  I'm not a lesbian, though.  Oh.  Would you talk dirty to Liddy?  To who?  Liddy.  Liddy.  Do you have Liddy today, Jimmy?  Who's always around?  Oh, I didn't know.  I didn't see her today.  Who's Liddy?  I don't want to talk about it.  No.  By the way.  Is that what you call it?  Of course.  Of course. 
[02:41:00]  You call it Liddy?  No, no, no.  Not that.  Oh, I see.  He's talking about his penis.  No, no, no, no.  No.  What is Liddy?  I call this the apology hour.  Hey, a lot of people pissed off at Norton right now.  Tony in the Bronx.  Tony.  Norton, you are the biggest tool in the world.  I'm sitting here with my rod in my hand, and you've got to go screaming something out,  like drop it on my face.  No, first of all, silly goose, I said chest, and she said to say something sexy, so I'm trying 
[02:41:30]  to be sexy.  I don't know.  Your infatuation with feces is gone far enough when I've got a rod in my hand, and you're  talking about it.  Dude, I didn't say feces.  How do you know what I was talking about?  I can't tell you how many guys were calling in saying they're going to drive off the road.  I think you guys are great.  Thank you guys for being back.  I was just thinking the other day that we need to bring some of this sexiness back, that  we haven't had enough girls doing that thing for us, you know? 
[02:42:00]  So that was great, Beth, to help us out today.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get into the Alan Sniff.  Well, we have DeeDee with the news.  We've got Alan Sniff.  And what do we want to do here?  I guess DeeDee.  Yeah, you want to do that?  A little bit.  A little hot water, maybe.  There's something to bring in for this oatmeal.  All right.  Here's the problem with the Alan Sniffin clips.  We're going to want to stop these.  And if they're in cart form, I'm screwed.  Go find out right now, Steve.  Oh, boy.  But I guess we could start by setting up the Alan Sniffin bit, Anthony.  Basically, this all started with our assault on the media that went perfectly with Nathaniel. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  Everyone knows what happened by now.  The videos are up on opianthony.com.  Basically, Nathaniel held up opianthony, spread the virus sign on live TV.  The reporter got bent out of shape and pretty much cursed him out after his broadcast was  behind the reporter.  And he said, opianthony, XM satellite radio, which got picked up on the microphone.  And I guess the reporter heard it.  He might have looked into a monitor and seen Nathaniel standing behind him.  And right when they were supposed to cut to tape, he turned around and said, what 
[02:43:00]  did he say?  What the fuck?  The fuck is your problem, man?  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Right.  And apparently, they hadn't cut to tape yet.  So that went out live.  He got fired.  And Alan Sniffin went on his message board.  I'm just going to play the audio of the event again, because we're getting new listeners  every day, just so they're up to speed.  But this is basically what happened.  Here's the audio portion of the video that you can see on opianthony.com.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit. 
[02:43:30]  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously  swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit.  But it's costing the TA a great deal, about $16 million a year, and they're trying to  put a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Oh, ho, ho.  So the guy didn't even wait.  He was so bent out of shape, and he turned around and said that, and then he got fired  pretty much like three, four hours later.  Yeah.  Not even, I think. 
[02:44:00]  It was over.  It was over, and it was a huge story for the show, and we encourage you guys to continue  that.  Yeah.  And there was no way, the reporter tried to, and there was really even no way to put  a good slant on it.  You know, there was just nothing he could do, pretty much.  I know what you're saying.  Actually, it was good.  I hear you.  It was actually good.  So, Alan Sniffen just said it was wrong what we did.  He's so horny. 
[02:44:30]  Look, I'm not trying to be a jerk.  All I'm saying is, when you get into that stuff, you're really on a slippery slope.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  He's so horny.  Me love you a long time.  Okay, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's not right.  So, he got fired.  Yeah.  Alan Sniffen, on his New York radio message board, he wrote a post about how awful it was, what  we were doing, how we shouldn't be doing this, how we shouldn't be using the background 
[02:45:00]  of a reporter's story when he's out in the field to promote the show.  It's hijacking their report, and it got this guy fired.  And my argument has been, no, it didn't get this guy fired.  What got this guy fired was him cursing on the air.  His unprofessionalism.  Right.  The guy, and regardless if it was us or a number of other events that pop up behind 
[02:45:30]  reporters on a daily basis out there, this happened.  If somebody else was walking up those subway steps, let's say, and had nothing to do with  Nathaniel, a radio show, nothing.  Just somebody walking up the steps.  And as he's doing his story, said, hey, hi, mom.  Hi, mom.  He would have turned around and said, what the fuck is your problem?  He would have done the same thing because he was upset that the story was getting screwed  up, that his report was screwed up.  Not that Opie and Anthony's sign was behind him. 
[02:46:00]  The guy was pissed.  And he turned around and very unprofessionally cursed on the air, and that's what got him  fired.  Not what we're doing.  Other reporters have done their story and been fine that we've been behind him showing  signs for the show and getting a little bit of publicity.  But Alan can't quite grasp that and thinks that it is our fault that he got fired because  we did this and he got fired.  So obviously, you put those two things together, we got him fired.  So Alan Sniffen, who's a dentist and also an expert on... 
[02:46:30]  Oh, by the way, he's a dentist.  He's a dentist and he's also an expert on New York radio.  He decided to respond with an MP3 audio response, he calls it.  Now, every week, Alan puts together what he calls board reflections.  He takes the week's top posts and comments on the board, and then he does a little, almost  what you'd call a radio show.  Yeah.  Based on his message boards.  Yeah.  Which is frequented by all kinds of radio people, either people that are really in  the business, old radio guys that are out of the business now but had been in the business, 
[02:47:00]  and a lot of just radio wannabes also are there that assume to know everything about  radio.  And that's who he's doing his little show to.  Small, small audience.  It's pretty much like muttering to yourself with a theme song.  We got the jingle, by the way.  I love the jingle.  He had a jingle put together for his board reflections.  You might be hearing that we're slightly distracted.  Yeah.  We got a photographer in here from Penthouse Magazine.  Yes, we do.  Trying to take shots of us as we talk. 
[02:47:30]  She's lovely, by the way.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  It's a girl.  It's a girl.  It's not a guy, it's a girl.  I didn't say a guy, did I?  No.  She's a lovely gal.  Good that it's a girl.  Mind taking her out for some ice cream?  Ooh.  Maybe a malted?  Nice.  Two straws?  Two straws.  Exactly.  A malt for me, my fat stomach.  Two straws, please.  Suck them down and look at her puzzled face.  Why are you sharing?  Bring me another.  So the story continues to have legs. 
[02:48:00]  Alan Sniffen is still discussing it.  And we got a couple of his clips here from his audio response.  It went on for 17 minutes.  Yeah, we can't give you guys 17 minutes.  Alan, we can't go for 17 minutes.  So why?  Because we actually planned for a show today.  I know.  We would have.  Yeah, we would have hoped you had more.  We would have taken the 17 minutes and turned it into 35.  Right.  So apparently somebody kind of cut it up a little bit.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  I hope it doesn't take away from the point he was making.  You've got to get a picture of Jimmy, too.  He's part of the show.  You don't have to if you don't want to.  Just get me from the side, like right there.  Just the lower part, from the nose to the chin.  That's my best feature.  People will think it's a tumor photograph.  What is this, a thing on brain cancer?  No, that's a guy standing there.  Oh, she's backing up a lot while she's trying to take your picture.  I know, it's really depressing.  She's getting like that Charles Whitman angle.  Do you photograph for Penthouse exclusively?  No.  No?  I shoot for a lot of different people. 
[02:49:00]  Have you ever photographed for Penthouse?  Yeah.  And naked women?  No.  No?  Yeah, and I'm waiting for the big guy.  Oh, she's waiting.  Do you know Suze Randall?  No.  You know who she is, right?  No.  Very famous photographer.  Oh, yeah?  She shoots for Penthouse?  Yeah, I think she shoots for everyone.  I know Penthouse.  I'll be right back.  Did you like the Bridges of Madison County?  No.  I thought that was like a photographer's movie.  Keep going.  Do you keep filming your refrigerator?  Yeah.  What's your name?  Danielle.  Hi, Danielle.  I'm Jim.  Hi.  Jesus.  We've got a love connection. 
[02:49:30]  She's, yeah.  Do you like her?  Sure do.  Without the connection part.  Exactly.  It's just kind of me like a loose, fat-titted wire flopping around in the water.  Oh, God.  We're easily distracted on this program.  So, I guess why don't we start with Alan Sniffen and the jingle that we joked about yesterday.  Love the jingle.  It's a good one.  I guess we're ready to go with the rest of the thing here.  I need the jingle first.  Here's Alan Sniffen.  All right.  This is Alan Sniffen, and I've got my response to Opian Anthony on Board Reflections. 
[02:50:00]  It's for May 24, 2004.  MusicRadio77.com.  That's right.  Board Reflections.  Find my comments about comments being made to the New York Radio Message Board, the mecca  of all internet radio message boards.  Yeah.  All right.  He knew we were going to play this today because he's really working.  Yeah.  I can tell right off the bat.  First of all, the mecca, it's the only radio message board.  No one else gives a shit.  And second of all, that theme music sounds like the sex music for every, like, 19 bad  70s Showtime movie you ever jack off to. 
[02:50:30]  Like, you ever see those British movies and they're having sex?  That's exactly the same music.  The almost Benny Hill type.  Yeah.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  But it's, yeah.  That's an old jingle from ABC.  Of course.  From music radio.  W-A-B-C.  Over, I guess, the course of the end of last week, I had some critical comments about it.  Sorry, and I'm trying to move these clips over so we can stop them.  And I need Derek's help.  I can't do it.  Perfect.  I know what to do from there.  Is this Derek's first trip with us?  We got some critical comments.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[02:51:00]  Don't interrupt Alan.  Wait, why is that?  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Dan.  I was wondering if it was Derek's first trip with us.  It was a road trip.  Yeah.  And it is.  Look at him.  Is that a real ID with your picture on it and everything?  You're like a real employee?  Yeah, they actually sent this up to New York a few months ago.  Wow.  God, how jealous are Nathaniel and Danny?  They don't have those, right?  No, no, no.  Oh.  They don't even have licenses, those incompetent idiots.  Hold a sign, stupid.  You, on the other hand, are a scrappy young go-getter. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, Derek didn't have to do any assaults on the media to become an employee of XM.  No.  Isn't that amazing?  I don't even think it works either, too.  They just gave it to me.  It still says intern on it.  Yeah.  You know what's amazing?  I was thinking about this.  You kind of separated yourself from the group by having the balls to hit a sound or a song during the show.  Just your own decision.  Remember that fateful day where he made a decision to just hit a song in the middle of us being on the air? 
[02:52:00]  And we were like, what the hell?  And it fit and it worked.  And that's all it took to separate him from, you know, those other guys.  Those other two fraidy cats just sitting there with notebooks.  Right.  Let's ask Eric to do it.  Eric's terrified in the studio.  Bumbling around, nervous, shaking.  Because I give him evil looks all morning.  You're too close to me today.  His head starts moving.  Balloons! 
[02:52:30]  Well, now I've got to explain.  Like, we all have that space that you don't want anyone, you know.  Mine is very big.  Yeah, yours is?  I have a very big space radius.  I need to clear.  Well, it's Utah.  I don't need people around me.  In New York, Eric sits, I mean, he is so close that, unfortunately, I could smell his breath.  Oh, jeez.  Is that bad?  I've actually never noticed.  Well, that's where that whole thing started.  Oh, what?  Because one time me and him were talking and someone opened a dumpster in your box.  Oh, my God. 
[02:53:00]  It's been much better.  I'm just kidding.  Eric gets very uncomfortable when we talk about this.  So by much better, you mean fixed, right?  Completely.  It's much better.  It's much better.  I never noticed there was a problem.  No.  To be honest with you.  Anyway.  I never did either because I have that huge area that nobody's supposed to be in.  But he uses the computer that Opie also uses during the show.  Yeah, but Eric is really good in the studio helping us out behind the scenes.  But he sits right to my left.  I mean, right next to me.  And some mornings, I'm a little uptight. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then those are the days I'm like, dude, you're sitting way too fucking close to me.  Yeah, I can't have somebody next to me, though.  I can't do that either.  I have to have a little bit of space, yeah.  I have to kind of put my arms out and do, you know, bird imitations.  Here we go, Anthony, with more Valance sniffing.  Oh, right.  Over, I guess, the course of the end of last week, I had some critical comments about Opie and Anthony.  You know, the guys that used to work at WNEW now are on XM satellite radio.  I was critical of them because their actions with respect to some of their fans resulted in a TV reporter losing his job. 
[02:54:00]  Now, call me crazy, but somehow I felt bad for this TV reporter that he was put in a position that resulted in him doing something he should not have done.  And incidentally, I acknowledge he said something he shouldn't have said.  He used the F word.  We all know that by now, right?  Well, it resulted in him being fired.  But I was critical of the Opie and Anthony program because they encourage this kind of behavior from their fans. 
[02:54:30]  That behavior isn't the core reason of his firing.  We can do this, and we will continue to do this because it works, and reporters, they get flustered.  But part of being out in the field.  They're self-important asses, first of all.  And again, I raised this point the other day.  It's amazing how they cover 9-11.  They cover beheading.  You never heard an Al-Zar Cowie beheading covered and had a reporter go, what the fuck is going on? 
[02:55:00]  But meanwhile, this guy is doing some inane report on a homeless guy swiping Metro cards, and his report is interrupted, and the ego gets involved, and he can't get over it, and he reacts normally.  Well, just because it's a normal reaction, and because it's an understandable reaction, doesn't mean that you don't deserve it to be fired for.  If I see a girl with a great ass, it's a normal and understandable reaction to go over and grab it.  But you know what?  Is it her fault for wearing the short skirt, or my fault because I can't control myself?  Very good.  That's right.  It's her fault.  Cockies. 
[02:55:30]  Everyone is saying that Alan is saying 2004.  Oh, he did.  He screwed up at the beginning.  That's right.  I love the general stuff.  I see Alan's point.  I do.  I can see his point.  I can see how somebody absolutely can have that point, and that's fine.  I just don't agree with it.  I don't agree with him saying that we are responsible for this guy's firing.  What Nathaniel did behind him, obviously if Nathaniel didn't do it, he wouldn't have been fired because he never would have lost his school and said that.  So you can say he was responsible in that way. 
[02:56:00]  But, like I said before, if a guy was walking up those subway steps and Nathaniel wasn't even there, there was no assault on the media.  Some guy coming out of the subway just waves at the camera and says, hi, mom, and doesn't shut up, or whatever he does.  And that reporter turned around and said the F word.  He would have been fired.  And then whose fault is it?  The guy coming out of the subway?  Would it have been the guy walking out of the subway's fault if he would have said something to the camera, and the guy lost his school, said fuck, and got fired? 
[02:56:30]  Would it have been the guy coming out of the subway his fault?  Why don't we take it one step farther, Alan?  How about this?  It's the homeless guy's fault, because if that bum hadn't been swiping cards, this poor man never would have been there to be in a position to have Nathaniel hold the sign of him.  Matter of fact, let's go back one step farther.  Come on.  His own actions got him fired.  End of story.  You can't say fuck on television.  Sorry.  Regardless of what's going on behind you, whether it's us, an intern with a sign saying Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio, or it's some passerby that wants to mouth off to the camera, or it's kids on a schoolyard story throwing something at the reporter. 
[02:57:00]  Whatever it is, you've got to remain cool and keep calm and not say curses.  They don't even curse in war zones.  Yeah.  Do you understand?  Dan Rather and Brokaw, these guys have been to Iraq, and they don't curse while there's bullets being fired.  They know that you don't say fuck on TV.  Right.  That's it.  If they can get away with that in a war zone and not let that fly out, you have no argument. 
[02:57:30]  The bottom line is he's a naughty potty mouth, and he should go back to doing what he does best, which I don't know what that is.  It's apparently not reporting, because his career is ruined.  All right.  Alan can't grasp that hole.  He gets it.  He gets it.  Well, let's see what else he has to say here.  Opie and Anthony responded on their XM radio program today to me, and I guess they would like me to respond back again, which I'm up to doing.  But see, here's the problem, guys.  I have a real job. 
[02:58:00]  And I get busy with this real job.  So, you know, it's very hard for me just out of nowhere to respond.  You know what I'm saying here?  He's using sound effects.  How great is that?  The guy puts dentist sound effects because he's a dentist.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  The guy obviously has a sense of humor.  Yeah.  I think through the years we've butted heads with him a few times, and I think he understands our show. 
[02:58:30]  He understands what we do here.  And obviously we've had differences of opinion.  Absolutely.  And the guy doesn't agree with our point on this whole thing.  We don't agree with his.  We watch porn.  He jerks off to the marathon man.  God damn it.  Jimmy.  The white angel.  Is it safe?  That must be great for a dentist.  That's classic.  It's the white angel.  All right.  Let's play another clip from Alan Sniffen's response here. 
[02:59:00]  First of all, let's get some analogies straight here, okay?  This is a case of a guy trying to do his job, that is the TV reporter, and having people come up behind him and intentionally trying to hijack his program.  So this is not a case of some innocent guy walking down the street, minding his own business.  This is somebody trying to do a job, and these guys are, in effect, sabotaging it by trying to hijack what he's doing for some other purpose. 
[02:59:30]  So at least let's understand what we're talking about here.  So, like, again, it comes down to you have to control yourself.  Like, when a dentist, let's use this example, there are times where a dentist will put a young lady under.  And this kind of goes back to my skirt example.  Is it the woman's fault for wearing a revealing shirt when the dentist grabs those tits, those moments that you described so well, Ed?  Is it her fault, or is it his fault for having a lack of control?  Now, it's an understandable response. 
[03:00:00]  You see big tits, you want to grab them.  Any man can say, you know what, if I strip myself to the core, by golly, I'd love to do that.  But you know what?  Too bad.  You can't do it.  You need some self-control, regardless of the situation.  And this goes beyond jobs and sabotaging.  This is just knowing what you can do and what you can't do in any situation.  This is just a human intuition.  This is called being an intelligent adult.  And I'll tell you something else.  If this guy was in the studio doing a report from inside CBS News studios and we barged in with a sign, that is hijacking the program. 
[03:00:30]  And I wouldn't recommend doing that.  You'd get arrested for trespassing and probably numerous other charges.  When they hit the streets, and the point has been made on the message board also, how would these guys like it if people interrupted with their show?  I'm sure they wouldn't like it.  And my answer is, it's happened.  Oh, yeah.  When you go out on the street, now you are opening yourself up to certain things that you don't open yourself up to in the controlled atmosphere of a studio. 
[03:01:00]  One thing is passerbys, the public, the whole idea that now it's fair game.  Behind your camera, in front of your microphone, when you're now out in the field like that, this will happen to you.  And you have to learn how to control yourself.  And people do interrupt this show, they call in, you guys suck, they're not trying to contribute to the radio show, they're trying to wreck it.  We don't try to, you know, hey, you're hijacking our show, you deal with it, you deal with it honestly. 
[03:01:30]  That's what we do.  And by the way, remember that news, the guys in the morning, hey, why don't you try the name Melania Nowse?  If that guy had cursed, say he had slipped, shut the fuck up to the weatherman.  Would the weatherman have been at fault for getting him fired, for interrupting him?  No, absolutely not.  Of course he wouldn't.  That guy's lack of control would have been.  And that guy was close to cursing out the weatherman, but it would not have been the weatherman's fault, it would have been his own fault for his own lack of control.  Take responsibility for your own behavior, that's it.  This happens to reporters all the time.  There are scenes going on behind them during their live shots. 
[03:02:00]  And Alan brings up a point that, well, if it doesn't happen a hundred times, and just happens that one time, that doesn't make it any better.  I can't wait for the next assault on the media.  I know.  Who's going to be the next one?  Let's continue here with Alan.  This is not a case of somebody having a sign waved at him.  This is a case of a guy trying to do his job being interfered with.  How would you like it if somebody interfered with you while you're doing your job?  My understanding is that you weren't too thrilled when some of the equipment at XM was preventing you from doing the job as well as you thought you should be doing. 
[03:02:30]  And that you guys had some pretty critical things to say about your bosses.  So don't you think that maybe when somebody interferes with somebody else's job, it's understandable why they might get just a little bit annoyed and why that might be justified?  He so doesn't get it.  That made for some great radio when we were going after the bosses.  Of course it did.  And the fact that we had horrible equipment at first. 
[03:03:00]  We actually loved the fact that we had bad equipment and we could beat up the bosses.  And when we did, we addressed it honestly.  We didn't put on phony radio voices and then let out our true selves.  The same idiots that you heard when the equipment works well are the same idiots you hear when it doesn't work well.  It's consistent.  We don't put on a phony persona and then all of a sudden when something happens, we are stripped naked and then you see who we really are.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  We are the same people when it works and when it doesn't work. 
[03:03:30]  Unbreakable jerk-offs.  You finished?  And by the way, we would have taken any flack from that.  We didn't pull punches.  We complained and there was a fallout from that.  And people bitched.  They were sick of you guys bitching.  And you know what?  We didn't back off.  We continued.  So if you're going to do that, then just take your medicine.  And we took our medicine, which was a lot of bullshit complaint phone calls, a lot of awful conference calls.  Whatever happened, we dealt with it.  Bravo.  We didn't bellyache about the results.  All right.  He has a few more clips here, Anthony. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Well, I have to say that the analogy would be if somebody stood behind a patient that I was working on  and held up signs that made me nervous and my hands start shaking and patients start getting nervous.  And that, to me, would be the analogy here.  This is not a case of somebody.  God, I would love to see that.  That would be fun.  Can we set that bit up for the studio?  And that's never happened in recorded history, by the way.  Right.  When you're a dentist, they don't say, all right, look, how about this, Alan? 
[03:04:30]  The next time you do dentist, pull a tooth on 57th Street and watch how fast somebody does stand behind you and make a problem.  Right.  And start talking to you and maybe distracting you.  Exactly.  This is happening in your office.  It's an awful example.  It's a complete apples and oranges.  I should be shot for saying that, but that's what it is.  That is silly, Alan.  The visual's hilarious with the head is.  Of course, the head is with signs behind them.  Yeah.  Wrong tooth, asshole.  Yeah.  What would they possibly do?  Spread the gingivitis. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  No.  That's all right.  Save the molars.  There you go.  Walking down the street having a sign held up, Adam, this is a case of somebody who's being interfered with while they're trying to do their job.  So if you're going to say, I've never experienced that, at least get it right about what we're talking about here.  This isn't about holding up a sign.  This is about interfering with somebody trying to do their job.  Part of the job is dealing with that in the field. 
[03:05:30]  It's part of the job.  They're talked to about this.  And the reporters never interfere when they're out there on the street trying to get their story.  They didn't shove mics into the firemen and the police officers' faces when the whole 9-11 thing was going down.  What can you tell us?  Well, I'm too busy now hoping that there are survivors here.  Could you leave me alone?  Do reporters ever care about results when they're doing their job?  Maybe a fucking Newsweek, reporters had gotten the thing right.  There'd be 16 or 20 more living people instead of reporting falsely about the Koran being flushed down the toilet. 
[03:06:00]  Reporters never give a shit about results.  They never care about stepping on somebody else's toes or interfering with somebody else's job.  So I have no mercy for any of them.  You think when they shoved that camera in Randy Johnson's face when he was walking down the street that they wanted him to say,  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Or they wanted the reaction they got.  Absolutely.  Which was him losing his cool at the camera and the reporter, which they played over and over again because that's the stuff they go after.  But the second they're out in public on the streets doing a stand-up and someone is behind him, quietly holding a sign, mind you, 
[03:06:30]  and saying where you could barely hear it, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  He wasn't taunting him.  He wasn't touching him.  He wasn't yelling to where the guy couldn't hear his story.  Was he distracting?  Sure.  Sure.  I'll give him that.  He was distracted, but he wasn't being kept from doing his job.  And if he was a professional, he'd have done his job and he'd still have a job.  But I do think, I'll even say Alan's correct in saying that they were interfering to a certain degree.  And you know what?  So what? 
[03:07:00]  They were interfering.  You still have to deal with that a certain way.  I don't want to hear, and reporters never care, when they leak information about a case or about a police information,  when they leak information, they don't care about interfering with the cops doing their jobs.  When they leak information about a suspect or about where an investigation is going, they're interfering with the police doing their jobs.  They don't give a shit.  They want to leak it because they want to be first.  So I have no mercy for them when it happens to them.  Nope.  Did he make that mistake?  Sorry, I was saying, and this is where it happens.  Of course.  On the street, the stand-ups.  You can't blame the guy with the sign behind the reporter if he curses on TV. 
[03:07:30]  Just as you can't blame just a passerby that yells something out and the reporter loses his mind and curses.  It's the same thing.  I suppose that on baseball, we should allow no heckling because what happens is when those pitchers,  when that guy's in the on-deck circle, they're yelling at him because they're trying to interfere with him doing his job.  There you go.  They are heckling you specifically to get you to fuck up.  Shouldn't do it.  I know the media is much more important than baseball.  I know they're completely infallible, but why is that not against the rules? 
[03:08:00]  Why are you allowed to scream at a pitcher or scream you suck at a player while he's warming up?  You're interfering with him doing his job.  We can go all the way down the line with this.  There's no excuse.  When a baseball player turns around and yells, fuck you, into the audience or into the stands,  or he physically goes after someone like that, there's a big problem.  The player is in deep shit.  No one says, well, it was the fans' fault for yelling at him.  It's the players' fault for going after him.  Behave appropriately.  You're an adult.  Did he make that mistake in a vacuum, Anthony? 
[03:08:30]  Did he all of a sudden, out of nowhere, just turn around and use the F word?  Inexplicably.  They couldn't believe it back there at Channel 2.  All of a sudden, he used the F word.  He's talking about something to do with the subway, and suddenly he's using the F word.  Is that what happened here, Anthony?  Or did it have something to do?  Yeah, Anthony!  I know.  He's addressing me.  Huh?  Well, open big.  But the answer is yes.  That is what happened.  Yeah.  CBS did say, he's saying fuck!  Right.  Right.  That is what they said. 
[03:09:00]  That's what they said.  I don't, it's funny, XM didn't fire Nathaniel.  Well, you can't fire a guy when you're not paying him shit.  But they didn't allow him to say, you can't come for free anymore.  Mm-hmm.  You can't come here and work for us for nothing.  You're not allowed to come here and do nothing for free every day.  With what your knuckle-dragging fans did.  Did it have some?  Oh, those are fighting words, Alan.  Yeah, Alan.  You know that.  You should know better, Alan.  Alan, you don't want to go down that road, do you?  Exactly.  Knuckle-dragging fans.  Come on. 
[03:09:30]  The key word is fans.  We do have them.  You do not.  They are pests.  Not knuckle-draggers.  Exactly.  Get it right.  Take a deep breath on the nitrous.  Something to do with somebody who, you know, I've got to hand it to you guys.  I'll give you credit for one thing.  It's amazing that you can inspire somebody to get up at what time did this guy have to get up?  At 4 o'clock in the morning, 4.30 in the morning, take that sign, drag it through the streets of New York City, hoping to ambush a TV reporter at 6 a.m. 
[03:10:00]  Do these people who listen to your radio show have jobs?  I mean, who's got time to do that?  By the way, can we raise one point, though, that Alan is doing what the reporters did after sexual...  That he's getting the facts wrong.  These weren't fans.  Nathaniel is a part of the show, and Cabby is a non-tax-paying guy who apparently doesn't like the show.  So the fans, the knuckle-draggers, insulting the fans when they had nothing to do with this.  There was no fan involvement.  But he says that's even worse that it's somebody involved with the show, an intern. 
[03:10:30]  That's not worse.  It's even worse because now we're even more responsible.  There's no responsibility for that guy being fired.  There's responsibility for distracting him.  Sure.  There's responsibility for, as he said, interfering with his report because there was some interference in there.  It definitely distracted him.  But responsibility for getting him fired?  Hell no.  It's his responsibility.  I'm kind of glad it happened, though.  Let's, uh...  You know that reporter?  You think that reporter would show you guys mercy of a problem cropped up?  Or he'd stick his stupid face in until he got the scoop? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  You guys created the environment whereby the reporter got upset and said something he shouldn't have said.  And I agree with you.  He shouldn't have done it.  He should have known better.  But it didn't happen in a vacuum.  It happened as a consequence of somebody deliberately interfering with him, attempting to hijack his TV report.  Come on here.  Let's get real about what happened.  Stop saying vacuum.  Say suction thing.  Right.  The thing that goes in the mouth. 
[03:11:30]  Sucks the spit sucker.  Let's go right to the next clip.  You give them an excuse to act like idiots.  Most of the time, they seem to be able to control themselves.  But Opie and Anthony on the radio, they're basically saying, hey, it's okay to go out there and act like a lunatic.  Go ahead.  Get up at 4.30 in the morning.  Drag a sign down to some subway station.  Stand behind a TV reporter and act like an idiot.  It's okay.  Go ahead and do that, please.  By all means, it's okay.  You're not a nut.  It's okay to do that.  That's right.  You see, when you make those kinds of situations whereby people with that mentality can behave that way, this is what you get. 
[03:12:00]  Who's the idiot?  The guy holding the sign?  Or the reporter who goes, fuck, on live television?  Exactly.  Who's the idiot?  There are plenty of instances where you see signs being held up and slogans being yelled in live shots.  It happens all the time.  But what doesn't happen all the time?  The reporter doesn't flip around and use the F word and get fired. 
[03:12:30]  How come when you're at Yankee Stadium and they're selling tickets and there's all fans going, Yankee's number one, that's number one.  Why did a reporter never turn around and go, could you shut the fuck up?  I'm trying to talk to the camera.  There you go.  They would think the reporter's insane.  Why don't you just admit that because it's an Opie and Anthony thing, there might be a slight bias in the interpretation of it.  And I don't want to hear if all the Yankee fans were there.  They weren't sent specifically to disrupt the thing.  Doesn't matter.  If you're doing your job and there's a distraction, you're not rifling through motives.  You're reacting either appropriately or inappropriately. 
[03:13:00]  And this guy turned around before the camera clicked off and went, what the fuck are you doing?  And now he's on the unemployment line.  And I'll tell you what the fuck Nathaniel's doing.  He's still where he's supposed to be.  And that's what he's doing.  And he's no idiot because now we look at him much differently.  Absolutely.  And when the listeners do it, we look at him differently.  That's right.  We treat him like stars for a day.  They come down to the station.  They hang out, check out the show, get all sorts of swag on their way out.  Nathaniel is still a zero, but he's a zero with balls.  And we like that.  That's right.  He's a courageous zero.  It is still true that you were able to inspire these knuckle-draggers to go out there at 5 o'clock in the morning and try and interfere with a TV show. 
[03:13:30]  And you don't see anything wrong with that?  You don't see anything strange about that?  No.  No.  Not in the world we live in.  It's right in line with what this show is about and what we do on a daily basis.  And it promotes our program, and normally it's not harmful to anyone's job if they know how to handle themselves.  It gets people talking, Alan.  Now, if you're yelling about it, if the police are doing something and you're yelling, 
[03:14:00]  Look out!  The cops are coming!  Then, to me, you're seriously interfering with someone's job because you're going to get somebody shot.  That's an interference with a job that there's no excuse for.  Some self-righteous, idiot reporter trying to get a great reel together so he can someday be the big anchor.  Fuck him.  I got no mercy for him.  Control your little potty mouth.  Do they worry about getting the facts right with the tsunami song?  They don't care.  Right.  They care about getting the scoop and getting their dumb faces attached to a story. 
[03:14:30]  How about this?  Somebody posted on the New York Radio message board.  People with signs whoop and holler behind Katie, Matt, and Al every day.  With signs.  They're yelling things.  Sometimes they're yelling things that probably aren't good for the air.  And does Al turn around and say, Shut the fuck up?  Here's Alan Sniffen's response.  Well, they know they're going to do that because that is specifically designed for that to happen.  They encourage signs to be brought, Anthony. 
[03:15:00]  Wow, Jimmy.  That is a bad example.  That is really good.  But that's what his argument would be, that this guy was not putting himself in that environment,  and they purposefully do, and they purposefully allow and encourage it.  All right.  We have, like, two more clips here.  How can you say that?  How can you say you're not doing something that is going to result in somebody's firing here?  Did the guy not get fired?  Is Arthur Chen now not looking for a new job? 
[03:15:30]  You cannot say that what you did did not result in somebody getting fired here.  Obviously, somebody got fired.  Let's not make believe it didn't happen here.  You want to say it's his fault?  Try.  Go ahead.  It's all his fault.  Never mind the fact that this guy was standing out there with a sign and somebody else was whipping the bird behind him.  No, no.  That had nothing to do with it.  The guy used an obscenity.  But, yeah, you're right.  I know you say it in sarcasm. 
[03:16:00]  Sorry, pal.  You're right.  It's his fault.  Yeah.  The guy that used, first of all, the guy that was flipping him the bird is a K-Rock guy who doesn't like this show  and is the same ass who went on the radio and bragged about not paying his taxes.  So his judgment stinks from way back.  That has nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  He probably would have stopped and gave the finger anyway because that's what he does.  Just acts dumb.  He doesn't care.  He's a Viacom employee and he gave the finger on another Viacom station.  At least we had the tenacity and the intelligence to do it with a company that can't hurt us anymore. 
[03:16:30]  Jesus, you don't tell your own company to go fuck itself on film.  I know.  Jesus.  I heard some serious employees are running around yelling, hey, Mel, your tan looks like dog shit.  Jesus Christ.  You don't do that?  It is his responsibility.  When you go out on the street, you've got to be able to handle what's going to come your way.  What do you think that's going to come your way?  And it's not just going to be us.  If you can't handle it, then don't do your live reports from the street.  There you go.  He could have done it against a wall if he thought somehow it was going to be a problem. 
[03:17:00]  And it's not just going to be the Opie and Anthony show.  It isn't just going to be us coming up behind reporters that might freak them out.  It's going to happen all the time.  It's New York City, for God's sake.  If he attacked him, if Nathaniel or somebody attacked a reporter, or did something that  is completely unheard of, or never happened, where a man just, what the fuck, that's a  completely different thing.  But this is something that happens almost every time you're on the street.  Holding up a sign and saying what's written on the sign. 
[03:17:30]  Hey, here's my point.  Hi.  Here's the sign that says it.  Behind a reporter.  This is so commonplace, it's ridiculous.  And does the media, when they hang out in front of your house, and they're trying to get  the scoop, do they care if they're interfering with your life, or interfering with your life?  They don't give a shit about what they're interfering with.  So, the Opie and Anthony show, this job is to do entertaining radio and get funny clips.  So, technically, Nathaniel was doing his job by doing something on this show.  Why should he give a shit about interfering with a reporter's job, when reporters don't 
[03:18:00]  give a shit about interfering with anybody else's job?  If we're going to go to the guys that's doing our job, well, then we were doing ours.  Trying to get good audio clips.  That's it.  We're doing our job.  It resulted in the guy's firing because he lost his mind and cursed on the air.  Not because of what we did.  Well, here's one more thing, by the way.  The Sex and St. Pat's thing, you know, the whole excuse of, wait, we were just doing our  jobs, I mean, it didn't hold a lot of water.  You know, it was over the line, and that was it.  Yep.  You could blame the company for allowing that environment to go on before him.  But you know what?  This show fucked up. 
[03:18:30]  We got fired.  It happens.  Exactly.  That's what happened.  You didn't hear Mel getting blamed.  You didn't hear Sumner Redstone getting blamed.  No.  You know, for allowing that environment to exist.  It was the fault of this show.  Why did the church keep the doors unlocked?  They should have had the doors locked.  And why didn't they get a security guard who didn't apparently steal out of the collection  thing?  You know, why not?  And someone is bringing up a good point.  Why don't they make that vestibule so sexy?  Absolutely.  Someone's bringing up a good point on the phones here, basically saying, why hasn't the  reporter responded?  Because he knew he was way in the wrong. 
[03:19:00]  He knew he fucked up bad.  Yeah.  But what can he say?  Exactly.  What can he say?  Here's the grand finale.  I guess here's Alan's wrap-up on the whole incident, Anthony.  Is there music?  Alan's totally wrong on this one.  Oh.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Meh.  Oh, okay.  He's going after you again, Anthony.  Yeah, that's me.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't know that.  We're making our comments and then commenting on it.  Okay, here it is.  Alan's totally wrong on this one.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, well, you know, maybe I am.  You know, I've been wrong, let's see, one, two, I think, four times in the last eight years. 
[03:19:30]  I'm not sure.  It could be number five.  It could be that I'm wrong here.  On the other hand, it could be that I'm right.  Look, you guys, you've known me a long time.  We've had back and forths before.  I've supported you in some cases.  I don't support you in others.  In this particular case, I don't support intentionally going out and trying to sabotage somebody else  when they're trying to do their job.  If you try to sabotage me while I'm working and I turn around and tell you what I think of you, 
[03:20:00]  is that really my fault or is it your fault for egging me on, for provoking me?  It's your fault.  That's what happened here.  You provoked the guy.  Yes, he should have handled it better.  And yes, you should understand that the situations that you create, you must take some responsibility for.  There he goes.  All right.  Alan Smith. 
[03:20:30]  And let me tell you something.  Here's another example.  Like, say this June 25th.  I mean, I'm doing the state theater here in Falls Church, Virginia.  It's irrelevant to this discussion.  You think I care?  There are people who call 703-237-0300.  Who gives a shit?  Go to Ticketmaster.  June 25th.  My first DC appearance in almost three years.  But if I'm on stage and I get heckled, they are trying to interfere with my job.  Right.  And I do want them tossed.  But if I walk over and punch that heckler, if I react inappropriately, you know who deals 
[03:21:00]  with that?  Me.  You know who gets sued?  Me.  The club doesn't go, well, the man was yelling it was okay if he was going to punch him in  the face.  Even if on an emotional level, you would go, you know what?  Fuck him.  He did deserve to get punched in the face.  But it doesn't matter.  I'm still the one who would get sued.  I'm still the one who would get in trouble.  And in summary, the assaults on the media will continue.  You bet they will.  They will absolutely continue.  If you're a news person, you're out there on the street, look out.  We're coming for you.  That's right.  But only on the Asians.  Only on the Asians.  Because they have potty mouths.  Because in the end, we have no respect for you guys. 
[03:21:30]  You stink.  And it's Arthur Cheehan, Alan, not Arthur Chen.  I don't know how you're saying it.  Alan's a racist.  I said Chen all day yesterday.  Well, you're racist.  No, I like Alan.  I think he's very...  He actually supported us big time.  Yes, he did.  In our demise.  We just...  The thing is, we have a difference of opinion on a few things.  Right.  And we always bring him up.  And he always actually has valid points.  He makes a good argument.  And I respect the guy.  And he was fair.  When the boot came, he was very, very fair.  And he was accurate about attacking the company where it should have been attacked. 
[03:22:00]  Because, talk about gloating for people being fired.  Let me tell you, his message board was chock full of people that couldn't be happier  and couldn't express it more about us being fired.  There's a guy named Josh on that board.  I don't know your real name, but let's just say this.  I hope your spine is severed by a Yoo-Hoo truck.  I hope a drunk driver runs you over and then backs over you.  Josh, you little faggoty name.  Yuck.  All right.  With that, Anthony, we've got to talk about Gamefly.

[03:24:30]  Because we learned a lot, if you think about it.  What an educational show.  So, if the guys in New York are paying attention, hit that button there and get us out of here.  Hit it, da-da-da-da-da.  Boobs always bring this show to a halt.  Oh, screeching halt.  I am playing.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This hat is beautiful.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.

Or else you'll move.  Move.  I see moves.  Move.  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  Hey.  They look amazing.  That's nice.  Bopey and Anthony.  Hey.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.

Stay fucking tuned. 
[03:26:00]  Because I'll come and fucking kill your baby, babe.  What a shot in the dark.  What a shot in the dark.  What a shot in the dark.  What a shot in the dark.  Ha, ha, ha.  That is hilarious.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show in about, I don't know,  10 or 15 minutes.  But Dan from Hoboken, I learned Dee Dee's pink doesn't stink.  Pink.  Pink.  That's really funny. 
[03:26:30]  Dee Dee, back in the studio.  Hi.  To do a little more news before we get out of here.  We'll be broadcasting from Washington, D.C. tomorrow as well, right?  Yep.  We have so much we didn't even get to today.  I know.  I commented on American Idol, but that's going to happen like tonight now.  They're going to choose their big winner.  Anthony made the New York Post.  Did you see that, Dee Dee?  No.  Oh.  But I'm going to later.  You're the news girl.  You're the unofficial news girl of the Opie and Anthony program, and you don't even know  that one of the guys is in the paper today. 
[03:27:00]  Well, I know now.  It's Anthony's obsession, this American Idol thing.  Bo.  You think Bo's going to win?  Bo, yeah.  He's got to win.  Well, is that a hope he wins because you like him?  I think he's a sexy guy, yeah.  I like the rocker kind of thing.  This is why I put him up top.  Can I have your quote, Anthony?  You can't read your own quote.  Can't read my own quote.  Incidentally, the show is tonight, right?  Yoshi is going, and I think he's wearing an Opie and Anthony's thing.  He's trying to get something Opie and Anthony on American Idol.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Who is?  Yoshi is going tonight, and he's trying to wear something with O and A on it. 
[03:27:30]  Tell him to just bum rush the stage.  Wait, that might distract one of the singers.  Oh, my God.  We get an assault on the media during the American Idol finale.  Just rush the stage.  Yes, we understand that would be horrible, but do it.  Anthony.  Anthony is quoted.  They did a whole thing on American Idol with the finals tonight.  Who do you think will win Idol?  And you're in good company, Anthony.  You're with Jay Thomas, actor and talk radio host.  Who?  I didn't know who else they were, like, asking this to. 
[03:28:00]  Well, Jay Thomas says in the same article that Anthony's part of.  Jay Thomas.  That's pretty good.  To me, it's Carrie.  I find Bo Bice, to sound like every guy I've heard at a Holiday Inn, imitating David Clayton  Thomas of Blood, Sweat, and Tears.  What goes up?  He's a sound-alike, not a talent.  I think she has a real chance of having a real career.  And then everybody else says, who the fuck is Jay Thomas?  Has anybody ever heard of this guy?  Who is he?  Well, you know, the other guy that commented in the same article as Anthony is Mickey Dolenz 
[03:28:30]  from The Monkees.  The Monkees.  Member of hit TV band The Monkees, and he's also a radio host.  Yes.  And he says, I've always been a Carrie fan.  I think she's the most genuine.  I think Bo has a great voice, but I think he's very derivative.  He's like David Clayton Thomas.  He says the same thing?  Same thing, David Clayton Thomas, but I don't see that.  He's like a David Clayton Thomas or a John Fogerty.  I think she has something that's more than the vocals. 
[03:29:00]  I think it's about presence and personality.  I don't see her having much of that at all.  Do you remember when we went over the first episode of American Idol when it was just a  tryout, and I told you that day that Carrie would have win it all?  You think so?  You said that?  And I haven't watched the show pretty much since.  Yeah.  And I'm surprised that she's even in it.  I was like, whoa, look, she's still going strong.  And then, of course, Anthony Cumia of the Opie and Anthony radio show has this to say  about who do you think will win Idol.  They were more scared than they usually are. 
[03:29:30]  This was last night's episode?  Last night, yep.  What, they had a head-to-head competition or something?  Yeah.  They both had to sing one song.  They both had to sing the same song.  So they started that, and then each of them got to sing two of their songs that they have  sung prior.  All right.  So Anthony's in the New York Post saying they were more scared than they usually are.  There were a lot of clunker notes between them.  I think Bo pulled it off a little more.  Yep.  He's a little more versatile.  He's definitely more versatile.  The girl there, Carrie, she's a country singer. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  And she pretty much can just sing country.  It's okay, Katie.  I know.  I just don't like country music.  Whoa.  You don't like what?  Country music.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Why?  Do you think it stinks?  No, it doesn't stink, but I'm a rock person.  Yeah.  You had a tough time saying country.  Country.  Country.  Yes.  I'd love to plant one of those in my yard.  Very funny.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to do some news to get us out of here? 
[03:30:30]  Well, I wasn't done.  Well, you weren't done.  I had to explain myself.  Absolutely.  I actually thought your quote was fine.  I'm just saying I wanted to elaborate because they, you know, take a bunch of things that  you say and just write that.  I said they were a little more scared than they usually are.  They were both nervous, very nervous.  I don't think they gave their best performances, either one of them, but Carrie is that country  singer.  The second you take her off a country, she's not that good with anything else.  But Beau seems to be able to handle any kind of musical type you throw at him. 
[03:31:00]  He seems very professional, like he can hold an audience, very good on stage, very good  with a mic, and he just looks more natural.  She is pretty much just very blah, up there, sings a song, and it's done.  What did you say after that comment?  Back to you, starring Barbara?  I know, I'm a faggot when it comes to this show.  He is obsessed with American Idol.  You've watched every episode, right?  Every episode. 
[03:31:30]  Why not?  Oh, call me silly.  I'm so weird.  It's the number one rated show.  Millions of people are watching it.  I didn't say you were weird.  Every time it's on, and I'm the weirdo for watching every episode.  It's not every day that you get hooked on a show.  That's all I'm saying.  I've been watching American Idol since, I think, the second season.  Someone has the real Anthony quote, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Let's go to Chris.  Can't wait to hear it.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, you got Anthony's real quote?  Yeah, I want to find out, yeah.  How come your quote wasn't, carries the press, bows the goer? 
[03:32:00]  Very good.  My old quote from Time Magazine about the Olsen twins.  Very funny.  Well, actually, that's hard to hear.  I've actually heard some of the audio of that, but it's kind of hard to hear because you  hear, like, well, I think that he's more virtual.  Can you do that thing for Dee Dee?  Because she loves the...  Oh, the tongue thing?  Yeah, do the tongue thing.  I like that.  Look at the tongue.  It's so funny.  It's cute.  Hey, we didn't get a sex story from you today.  We didn't get to spank you today.  Tomorrow. 
[03:32:30]  Whoa.  Let's move it out of the way.  That scared me.  No, Jimmy's going to spank you as you do the news.  Oh, shit.  Because who cares about the news, right?  No one cares about the news.  Yeah.  It's your backside we're interested in.  You already took my first story anyway, American Idol.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I forgot you're in charge today.  Oh, my God.  All right.  More news with Dee Dee?  Sure.  Why not?  Let me try to do this.  Uh.  No.  How about, uh, this?  Uh.  No. 
[03:33:00]  This?  Ah, this.  There it is.  All right, Dee Dee.  If you will.  All right.  Well, we already talked about American Idol.  Well, that's fun.  Thanks.  All right, I have some Aussie news.  If you have a few million dollars lying around, you could sleep in the same bedroom that Ozzy  and Sharon Osbourne have occupied.  Opie?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nothing.  Are they selling?  You bag of shells?  Yes.  $11.9 million is going for their old mansion.  Their old mansion that was on the Osbournes?  On the Osbournes, yep.  They're buying a new one.  That's going to be kind of hard to get a mortgage for. 
[03:33:30]  Oof.  $11.9 million.  Jimmy?  Nah.  Not half of it.  I'm close.  I can put down 1%.  I can put down 10 grand.  Is that cool?  No.  Tenth of a percent?  Probably, yeah.  That's not...  I don't do math.  Point percent would not be...  Quick, Ricky, get that figure for me.  All right.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  Some hot teen news.  Oh.  Is this new?  Is this happening in Florida with rocks?  No, this happened in Houston.  All right, hold on.  Let me see if I have that thing.  I need the thing. 
[03:34:00]  Uh...  No.  Ten percent is $100,000 of a million, right?  Yeah, you would need $1,100.  Did you find it?  Yeah, hold on.  I mean, technical difficulties.  Well, you know, we're in Washington.  We're not used to all the buttons.  Washington.  Hold on here.  Ah, this.  O.D. and Anthony's Hot Gene News.  All right, in Houston, seniors at Memorial High School got together for a private Playboy-themed 
[03:34:30]  party, sending school alumni into a fit of rage.  Each year, the senior males throw a themed party that is not sanctioned by the school,  and this year's theme was the Playboy Mansion.  And some alumni members said the Playboy party went too far, and it was too hot for teens.  Students who attended the party disagree, saying it was all clean fun.  Although no dress code was established, some of the girls showed up in skimpy lingerie.  Oh, pass the pictures. 
[03:35:00]  Pass the pictures.  You can't really see it, though.  It's not that good of a picture.  Oh, we can see good enough.  Oh, yeah.  And one alumni member, Sarah Boone, received a racy picture from the party in an email.  Everyone is shocked, Boone said.  However, one parent whose son attended the party said that the senior boys tried hard to  throw a fun, safe party.  It was held at a private venue with chaperones and police there, and attendees were required  to sign waivers promising not to drink alcohol.  Boone said that when she graduated in 94, they were wearing formals and not skimpy bikinis. 
[03:35:30]  They were wearing, like, bikinis.  What's the big about, there's nothing in this picture?  No.  Well, no, you can go to, like, localnews.com or something like that.  What an out-of-touch woman Boone is.  When are we going to have our next teen party?  How about our first?  We used to have those.  We had, like, a teen slumber thing once.  Where we had teen girls show up in the studio in their pajamas.  Like, how old were they?  Don't worry about it, Dee Dee.  Were they legal?  They all said they were 18. 
[03:36:00]  18 and 19.  18 and 19 are teens, and that's legal.  Who has time to check IDs?  Oh, my God.  Well, no, I mean, that's what you talked about.  I like them when they're 10 teens.  Oh, God.  We like tweens.  Tweens.  Okay.  All right, Jimmy, can you spank Dee Dee, please?  Oh, God.  He needs a belt.  Who has a belt?  Someone take off their belt.  He's got one.  Oh, here we go.  All right.  That was just fun.  All right, Dee Dee, as you do the rest of the news, Jimmy's going to spank you, right? 
[03:36:30]  I'm done with it.  What do you want me to do?  You took my one story.  Give me something.  You have it all morning to prepare stories, and that's all you have?  Well, because I thought we were going to, okay.  I'm not experiencing the belt.  I'll warn you.  You spanked with the buckle end, right?  No, you're going to make it hurt.  Of course.  Well, just tell me how much.  Hold on.  How hard?  Let me see if I can find...  All right.  Yeah, here.  Here's a story for you.  Oh, God.  Here's a story for you.  Oh, God.  I'm anticipating right now.  Don't do that. 
[03:37:00]  I won't do it, Hart.  All right.  Here's a couple stories.  Here's a pretty good one here.  I got one.  New drug delays.  Male orgasms.  Yeah, yeah.  And this one's good.  Take you out to the woodshed.  I can't do this.  You have to lean forward, though.  You're a lady.  I won't do it too hard.  Relax.  Jimmy, take control over there, will you?  Lean forward.  Push it over there.  Oh, God.  I'm going to...  All right.  Here's Jimmy.  Look at her.  She's all nervous and turning red.  Because...  It's going to sting. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, it's going to sting.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Too hard?  Oh, but it's okay.  It's good, right?  It's good.  I got to get checked in.  All right.  Here's another story.  I'm not going to be able to read it all.  Like anyone cares.  There's three stories to try to get through, all right?  Okay, how about a new drug delays male orgasms?  I mean, fine.  Damn, that hurt.  It's...  It's...  Um, the first drug formulated to treat premature ejaculation.  No.
