<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Opie's unproductive day spent watching news about the struggling economy under President Obama.  This led to a comparison of the Obama and Bush presidencies, focusing on their public image and handling of crises, peppered with disparaging comments about Hillary Clinton's appearance.  The reading of a listener email containing a racist comment about Obama sparked a debate about the New York Post cartoon controversy and Al Sharpton's response, with the hosts criticizing Sharpton's tactics.  The conversation then shifted to "forced diversity" in the workplace and its comparison to past civil rights movements.  The show then solicited listener suggestions for the "greatest last hurrah" ever, receiving responses ranging from the Northridge shootout to the Jonestown massacre.  A substantial portion was dedicated to a graphic and humorous discussion about bed bugs, spurred by caller anecdotes, expanding to include other pests, such as cockroaches, and a caller's experiences with camel spiders and scorpions in Iraq.  The segment concluded with humorous commentary on photos of the hosts with Green Day and Sam Kinison.

The show continued with more discussion about old photographs, specifically focusing on unflattering images of Opie, including those with Sam Kinison and "Brother Weez" and Chris Shire.  Opie's plan to post these pictures online prompted further jokes about his past fashion choices.  A brief, vaguely described horrific story involving an 11-year-old was mentioned before Opie announced his upcoming appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  A controversial Japanese rape video game fueled a discussion about freedom of expression, with caller JC pledging to post FatErock.com images around his school.  A phone call with Bobo from the "David and Bobo" radio show resulted in a comedic bit about their interview style.  The hosts discussed FatErock.com and their plan to create street art using its images.  Further discussion of the video game contrasted the hosts' approach with that of the news media and politicians, alongside tangents about the Oscars, Battleship, and a humorous anecdote about a Battleship commercial.

The next segment began with a discussion on the humor derived from language barriers and a comparison to the perceived lack of humor in depicting a wedding night.  This transitioned into a satirical celebration of Marvin Berry from *Back to the Future* for Black History Month.  Anthony detailed his new home theater setup, and a caller, Lydia, shared two bizarre dreams about the hosts, leading to a sexually charged and vulgar exchange, followed by mockery of her perceived prudishness.  The hosts then discussed the weight gain of Sally Struthers and Charlene Tilton.  A discussion about interactive advertising billboards utilizing facial recognition technology sparked a conversation about privacy concerns and the absurdity of targeted advertising.  This led to a humorous hypothetical scenario of what ads would be shown based on appearance.  The segment continued with a discussion about various infomercials, including Finally Fast PC optimization software, Stacker 2, the ShamWow, the Slap Chop, and the Vegematic.  A self-proclaimed motivational speaker, Ted, briefly appeared in studio to discuss the "Cheers to You" motivational CD before leaving abruptly.  Other products like the Pocket Fisherman, the Flobie, and HD wraparound glasses were briefly mentioned. The segment concluded with a discussion of listener submissions for a "funniest listener" contest and the definition of "winnow."

The following segment opened with a discussion of a foot-care product called a "pet egg,"  resulting in graphic jokes. The conversation shifted to infomercials, focusing on Miracle Blade knives, Ginsu knives, and the Mr. Microphone, with a caller sharing a story involving the Mr. Microphone, a car radio, and a sexual encounter.  The hosts discussed YouTube's related video suggestions, highlighting absurd and sexually explicit titles and thumbnails.  A caller discussed the Rocket Reel fishing pole, leading into a lengthy interview with Bob Gale, co-writer of *Back to the Future*. The interview covered the film's creation, casting decisions, content, sequels, and behind-the-scenes anecdotes, including rejected ideas and challenges with actors.  A call with Ted, a movie memorabilia collector, featured discussion of his unusual and disturbing collection from various films, including items like dirt Darth Vader allegedly stepped in and Marlon Brando's mustache hairs. The segment ended with more discussion of *Back to the Future*.


The final segment focused on the departure of long-time employee Will Chapman. The hosts discussed his contributions, including his creative (and outrageous) incorporation of sponsors into their comedic bits.  An anecdote about Will's on-air rant against a product ("a box of cock meat," later corrected to "pussy meat") that nearly cost them a multi-million dollar deal was recounted.  The hosts also joked about Will's chaotic contributions and penchant for complaining about products, using frequent profanity and crude humor. A listener's unusual possession—Peter Sellers' spleen in a jar—was briefly mentioned. The segment concluded with Will's farewell and the hosts' profane send-off.

[00:05:30]  did why do they really hate her yeah because she's the secretary of state is that the only reason  that's got to be the only look at bill clinton i've never seen that picture oh that up on  onaradio.com i've seen her look like that with the long straight hair and the hippie glasses that  are kind of shady but then uh bill clinton with the long hair and the beard and then he becomes  president how cool is that he's a hippie that's the president and secretary of state yeah yeah there  you go but he's fake hippie though you can tell it's weird man he's allowed to be what was that his 
[00:06:00]  oxford days where he was uh road scholar yeah how to have the look the patches on the elbows  you gotta grow your hair out a little yeah yeah road scholar look like you're a little crazy because  you're so smart it's like you're so smart you don't have time to groom right man i bet her  armpits look like the top of her head you know hair was just growing i don't have time to shave my  armpits mad she was never a good looking broad no you know i mean they get a little older you know 
[00:06:30]  whatever but you see the younger pictures usually you see a little cuteness or a little something in  there she got that big round face you know it slims that out that brings the cheeks in  well here's the first racist comment of the day this is uh the wonderful world we live in barry  the blade from utah writes opie obama's used to signing like that it's like using different cans  of spray paint oh is he talking about like graffiti and the fact that people that oh jeez okay right 
[00:07:00]  we got it yeah yeah so we get it so i watched the cnn and the situation room and all that uh all day  yesterday yeah were you just like was your pulse racing at the end were you just looking out your  window waiting for disaster i'm just reminded of bill hicks because he talks about that very thing he  goes yeah you watch cnn for for 15 i forget how much time and you think the whole world is collapsing  and then you turn off the tv and open your windows and you hear crickets and you know 
[00:07:30]  normal stuff kids playing right birds yeah all that chirping all that fun life stuff where's the  situation like the kids don't know the birds don't know it's just having fun right i love that i love  that bit of his because it's so true because they have to just completely focus on disaster  yeah we had uh but everyone's yelling to obama like you know obama has made it perfectly clear  we're in a tough spot but everyone's saying obama you have to tell the american people that although 
[00:08:00]  it's really bad it's going to get better and he hasn't done that a lot of people are not happy with  the fact that he hasn't done that yet well he's uh yeah he's not good at reassuring the nation he had  all this stuff beforehand on the election how things are going to be great yeah you know and uh now  he's doing i guess he's doing things you know this stimulus stimulus plan but uh yeah it's all doom  and gloom and and to me it's the same tactic that uh that bush used with terrorism you know it's just 
[00:08:30]  keep the american people scared on edge right and on edge and and make them think that you're the only  guy that can get them through this right and they'll keep you in office and believe me they're  they're actually thinking ahead two years look for the next election in two years when you know  they got to keep their guys in and and he's a he's a politician like everyone else because obviously a  lot of people love this obama guy but he's he's not stupid he knows if he keeps everyone like you 
[00:09:00]  just said on edge and all that he could get some other things done that's what politicians do  no matter who you are it's exactly the same thing bush was doing with the war sure he's doing with  the economy the the terrorism wasn't fake i mean we saw what happened it wasn't a made-up thing uh so  bush to latch on to that and then use it to to keep the people scared for for eight years or whatever it  was uh he was able to do that right and he was able to get a lot of uh bills passed um for uh what people 
[00:09:30]  saw as an invasion of privacy the the patriot act and things like that uh with that fear the  economic problem is a real problem boy is and and i see obama kind of using that as something to keep  people you know hey we got to keep this guy in here we got to keep his democratic cronies in here  yeah i agree in two years because and the republicans are fighting the good fight yeah you know they have 
[00:10:00]  elections they want to win in 2010 yeah so you know it's the same kind of thing but you know  something it's very dangerous it's disheartening and and for morale it's it's terrible but with that  said i bring it up for one reason you gotta you gotta look for your own signs to to to know that  the world's gonna be okay or this country's gonna be okay yeah my thing obama when he's talking to  the press and he's talking to congress and all that he's got his hand in his pocket he's making jokes  and he's smiling i'm like okay if it was really bad they wouldn't be doing oh is that it yeah you 
[00:10:30]  gotta get your own you gotta you gotta check out your own little you know i don't know he might be  like scared you think out of his yeah out of his mind before he steps out there they don't just look  loose look loose look fine and they're still going off here rupert murdoch issues apology for  controversial why is rupert that's the beginning of the end right there well because the naacp got  involved i was following that story yesterday too yeah what were they threatening now they're 
[00:11:00]  threatening well there's a there's a uh thing there's a thing a thing where uh you know rupert  got a little pass so he could you know own more stuff than he's legally supposed to tv papers it's  a thing they're calling for an investigation of the fcc on all his properties he owns and uh  sharpton's demanding that well their licenses are all renewed about your uh investigations there mr  sharpton you know what spike lee did spike lee was on uh it might have been the situation room 
[00:11:30]  i don't know because they're all the same to me for the most part but spike lee basically hinted to  all the athletes this is spike lee's angle because he's a big knicks fan as most people know sits in  the front row for every every home game he hinted that the athletes might not want to talk to uh the  post reporters anymore and this is another way that they could like hurt the hurt the newspaper  so spike lee was hinting that all the black athletes ask who's uh who this person represents  before he talks to them and if it's the post then maybe they would not comment or talk to that 
[00:12:00]  individual and then maybe the team would crack down on the athlete and refusing to talk to certain  papers and then maybe the people would start just bashing the athlete and getting quotes anyway  but it'd get ugly i hate the post anyway just why don't they just calm down  just calm down leave the goddamn comic it's in the past it happened forget about it  that's the biggest thing because you know this is very important to him because obama's been in the 
[00:12:30]  news for two years uh during this whole election run and then being elected and that and sharpton  realized he was on the back burner yeah since the imus thing yeah and now it's his chance to come  back out it's his big debutante ball again where he's able to come out and and uh get all feisty  yeah he's got uh he's got another rally planned oh he loves stuff like this you know now you got 
[00:13:00]  to go into hostage negotiations with sharpton that's how this always ends that's what it is  it happened imus and uh imus's company which i guess is ours right uh you know half of them  mbc was one and yes it was one uh but that's what ends up happening in these situations you get  you get to go into hostage negotiations with al sharpton great that's and he pretty much gets it  his way or or you know the highway i didn't want to say my way or the highway so well we look forward 
[00:13:30]  to the hostage negotiations yeah see how that pans out every day though you got to see the comic and  people protesting and stuff you know there's more important things i thought the cartoon was a bit  harsh but now sharpton's like you know just disgusting me once again the the cartoon was harsh  right so you know what it's freedom of expression it's the paper they could do what they want and  protest and stuff but it when it gets down to extortion that's where i have a problem 
[00:14:00]  his thug tactics voice your opinion that you do not like it that's it see how many people you can  get together that say we don't like this and that will show people wow they really there's a lot of  people that are upset about this then when they go the next step where they start going we demand jobs  we demand this we want you to do this then it gets out of hand where it's like now it's not just  your freedom of expression against his freedom of expression it's extorting it's it's it's mob tactics 
[00:14:30]  it's it's putting people's livelihood uh at risk because you don't agree with what they say because  you have some imaginary thought that this country is based on the fact that uh there's a right to not  be offended which does not exist when uh the end well the NAACP guy was on tv last night um which one  an indicted one or uh one of the ones that haven't been indicted on all kinds of uh misappropriations 
[00:15:00]  with money and everything else he uh he wants them to look at the board of directors he wants them to  look at management maybe there's not enough representation in management why yeah they're going  deep they want a fine balance throughout the news corp yeah and they want the paper they want not just  the paper anymore now it's like they want to make sure like the all the management levels have a have 
[00:15:30]  a nice variety of people they're demanding diversity right in a a company where you know you hire the  best guy you don't or or the guy you think can do the best job as a boss that's what you do if that  guy's you used to do then you hire him if he's white you hire him and i gotta correct you that's  what you used to do yeah they don't do that anymore now it has to be a balance so so people that might  not be the right color are uh not being offered the job because they have to fill quotas and they 
[00:16:00]  have to you know keep it all balanced and nice i hate forced diversity they have to keep it all nice  diversity it's awful it's just one of those words stop it we all know what it is they use it as a  foot in the door it's not even a genuine outrage it's it's a genuine annoyance or being bothered  right that is they continue it just because they get a foot in the door yeah and they're just going  to use that position uh you said to extort it's fraudulent yeah fraudulent outrage and it's different 
[00:16:30]  than what was being done when uh blacks stopped using the buses as a protest yeah that's different  they they saw a service that they weren't going to use anymore so if blacks all want to stop buying  the post and show their power that way do that protest take signs whatever you want to do but then  when you start saying you know we want diversity you know we want this we want job we want people 
[00:17:00]  fired that's a completely uh different scenario why are you talking yeah it's not gonna make a  difference i i try to make a difference i know i'm just obviously i'm just joking i mean reverend i  was not gonna play this now all the way to the end i get many um i mean if you got you got rupert  involved rupert didn't even know this comic existed you don't care but now he had to like uh you know  get his apology out there to try to save some it was not save jobs by the way save business yeah  i get i get emails i get so many emails every day from people that say anthony thank you so much 
[00:17:30]  for putting a voice behind people that don't have a forum like you do and uh usually they're signed  with some weird like an 88 at the bottom i don't know what that means or 14 words um is another thing  that's on the bottom uh i don't uh i have no idea i don't know what that means i all these are those  type of jokes okay thanks danny to the white supremacist oh jesus i did watch a great show last 
[00:18:00]  night on um one of those history channel of course yeah and it was about um how uh there's gangs  in the military like you know the bloods crips all of them latin kings and they're joining the  military to get training on how to use military tactics against other gang members in the streets  so they have uh these guys and one guy that was in this gang they showed a surveillance video of him 
[00:18:30]  just shooting at cops in marine um shooting patterns where he modified a gun made it fully  automatic illegal by the way and uh had cops pulling up and was just taking them out using these  marine moving and shooting tactics wow and uh he just ambushed uh about three or four cops  killed one of them injured another one really badly and um then finally just had his last hurrah in an  alleyway against some swat guys and they weren't taking any guff the old last hurrah yeah it was the 
[00:19:00]  last hurrah with a helicopter light on him and uh the swat team oh goodbye i'm gonna test you it's it's a  very obvious uh answer the greatest last hurrah ever wow think about it what do you mean grayest  or greatest it's still early greatest oh please my mouth's still like i won't say it but i got it  you got all right all right maybe someone has someone uh one out there as well 877-212-018 when we get  back the greatest last hurrah ever that's hurrah opie and anthony 
[00:19:30]  a bit ominous opie and anthony yeah hopefully you have a job today do you  i don't know from uh looking at all the people on the uh road this morning  uh people are still commuting i'll tell you that and i think gas prices yeah going down i know 
[00:20:00]  they've been inching up a little but nowhere near where they were uh people back bringing their goddamn  cars back out on the road because i'm noticing uh a lot more uh traffic earlier in the morning than  there has been so i think people are uh starting to take their cars back out again  i lost one in my family brother-in-law yeah no job really fired gonzo what'd he do he uh  i don't want to really say he had a pretty good job though secret agent and uh the lovely company 
[00:20:30]  he was away on business and they did it they fire him while he's away on business for the company  that's what they do  and but a direct result because the economy yeah it's a full world out there these days that's the  first one i know of in my extended family happening to everybody 877-212-0&a  wow i like this little groove yeah it's cool so we're looking for the uh the greatest last hurrah 
[00:21:00]  of all time why are all these movie ones on on the uh board because they don't listen are we going  for movie we're not going for movie uh last hurrahs they're doing bonnie and clyde butch cassidy and  the sundance kid well bonnie clyde was for real but i think you're thinking of the um the movie  version yeah which one was better bonnie and clyde or uh uh butch cassidy as far as uh the greatest  last hurrah uh butch cassidy and the sundance kid was fantastic when they were just getting ready to 
[00:21:30]  they knew it was it was over johnny yeah they just come out of their little hiding spot and run out  and hope for the best yeah and then milan the whole army is out there just waiting that's a great  great scene and then uh someone said jonestown uh this guy has one that's a pretty big last  that's a big one yeah let's say hi to john in new york city john uh how you doing um the one that i  want to mention uh i mentioned uh is of course the northridge shootout in hollywood with amir 
[00:22:00]  and larry phillips the two gentlemen that decided to wrap they decided to wrap multiple layers of um  bulletproof vests around them they had full auto the um full auto weapons with like 120 240 round  drums and the interesting thing is as you mentioned the gang members learning military tactics the  interesting thing is that these two individuals were weapon enthusiasts they had no military training  and i saw a thing on the history channel about it they said my god if they did have um that type of 
[00:22:30]  training that would have been a real massacre they were just monsters they walked or they just walked  around getting hit by gunfire and shooting at people that were shooting at them they were the  closest thing to didn't use cover or anything no they were the closest thing to zombies yeah  they're um at the only place that wasn't covered with um bulletproof vests was there the SWAT guys  they thought they shot their um ankles because they're sneakers they didn't have bulletproof sneakers  on yeah that's how they know one of the guys they kind of got him under a car and nailed his feet and  then came around and uh and then that one i believe one killed himself but it's very interesting 
[00:23:00]  because i mean um my friend asked me says well why do you know those two guys names i was like well  it just shows that um why we need to keep our guns legal because even though they had no um military  training it just goes to show you if you have the proper equipment then you know tyranny uh they can't  really you know they're not going to take your guns well you're gonna you're gonna get lunatics like  this believe me it doesn't it doesn't matter but uh the fact that they had automatic weapons made  them illegal but best hurrah though the only people that died were them yeah the only two that died 
[00:23:30]  they didn't kill anybody that was a pretty good hurrah no that's that's the one i had in my mind when  we brought this up the the greatest last hurrah it's just yeah i don't think killing other people  is part of to be part of the big last hurrah you do have to be putting people's lives in danger  and perhaps killing some people but it's not how many people you killed before you got taken out  it's it's the way you get taken that was real life grand theft auto that was when it starts with one  star then two then three then four you got the helicopters and the the swat teams and they got 
[00:24:00]  that was real life busted at gun stores to get better uh weaponry than they had yeah it's very  interesting though that's that's right but it's very interesting though because if you do a search  online on google on northridge shootout a lot of stuff things don't pop pop up and it's like  you know i'm not a conspiracy theory guy but maybe i'm thinking it's like they don't i mean  they don't want people to know that um these two individuals uh you know did that without any 
[00:24:30]  training you understand does that make any sense no okay there's no conspiracy there's just yeah  whatever's out there is out there i've seen i've seen if there was such a conspiracy how come i  watched like a two-hour special on every aspect of it on the history channel oh no no i mean i'm  sorry i got it wrong i'm just trying to say that maybe they think that they don't want people to  know that you know um you know you don't need any type of special training to wreak havoc if you're  going to wrap yourself in bulletproof ammo and convert weapons to full auto that would be interesting 
[00:25:00]  this is 240 uh well yeah no kidding it's because nervous nelly all right john thank you all right  thank you sir you pretty much got big fan take care uh what did he say i'm a new fan but a big  fan oh wow thanks john uh that that was pretty much what we were thinking when we were saying the  greatest yeah last hurrah that's pretty big um although somebody brought up 9-11 that's pretty  big that's the first guy i thought of was muhammad atah but i mean yeah yeah yeah i mean if you're if  you're one of those guys yeah i guess that was a big one yeah that's a biggie i was thinking more 
[00:25:30]  like shootouts and stuff but yeah i just kind of thinking the shootout thing i don't know uh let's go to  mike in smithtown mikey hey guys what's up mike hey what's up the best one is when that guy stole  the tank and then he's destroying everything and then he gets stuck on the divider and then the  cop just reaches in those tanks not moving anymore yeah shots to the head yeah he blasted him right  on the top of his noggin that was some amazing that's a good one that was amazing video with that 
[00:26:00]  tank just running over everyone's cars that guy was ready to jump that divider and go onto a freeway  in a tank going the opposite direction of traffic yep i mean he was that if he didn't get hung up on  that barrier there was definitely going to be some deaths can you imagine you're on the highway just  cranking your tunes and next thing you know there's a tank but the guy that street that he went down or  those few streets he went down running over he hit um like a a little mobile home one that you pull 
[00:26:30]  behind your cars and stuff like that take on vacation the thing just crushed into nothing  and the tank didn't even you would think like the side of it would come up if you're riding over  something that high it never even changed its its angle the whole tank just drove over i'm just  pushing we're looking at the video now yeah he pushing that van like it was nothing and then it  gets hung up and then he just destroys it he's right over it look this thing he cuts through this  like it's nothing wow it's a tank that's just amazing and they were worried like is it armed 
[00:27:00]  does the guy have a you know can he use the gun on this thing and another grand theft auto scenario  yeah he was apparently some guy that just kind of went nuts uh he he knew how to drive tanks he was  uh went to the armory right picked one up and just started driving over and through anything and the  cops actually said when he listened to the radio transmission said there's nothing we can do about 
[00:27:30]  this because there's not he was trying to knock down a bridge yeah he started pounding the tank into  the concrete supports of a bridge trying to knock it down and uh wow just running over everything how  much gas do you have in that where do you get more yeah right you just pull up to a gas  station it must get a half a mile diesel in there per gallon he uh yeah he he definitely wreaked some  havoc and then um cops got in there when he got hung up and that was in one what do you hop on was it 
[00:28:00]  like a was it one of those barriers big concrete divider on uh like uh that would separate uh two  lanes of an expressway okay freeway right there yeah he was trying to get to the other side and then  he's trying to if he would have hit it head-on he probably would have went right over it but he hit it  like on an angle where the tracks were on either side of the divider so he couldn't get off and the  cops yeah yeah it is like a bolt cutter or something to open that hatch and then just pop pop up yeah  they didn't play bye bye they didn't want him alive let's say hi to don in jersey don hey what's up 
[00:28:30]  guys hey don uh i'm not sure what town i was in it was a while ago the guy took a bulldozer he got a  couple tickets from the town or something and uh he surrounded it with steel and concrete and  basically just destroyed the entire town he took out the judge's house he took out the town hall  remember that one and then uh i think i'm sorry the only way they cut it the only way they stopped  him was uh i think i think he he messed up the truck or he ran out of gas or whatnot there they  couldn't even get in it and uh he ended up shooting himself after he killed himself it took him like two 
[00:29:00]  hours to get inside the thing they had to get welders to uh open the thing up for the  yeah he had completely sealed himself inside this thing yeah and then just uh drove it around the  town destroying everything amazing some people really get mad other uh thank you sir uh our bud  dwyer's coming in a lot and uh columbine which is just such a oh yeah yeah well that was a sad one  but if you're talking about the the last hurrah that was a biggie it was memorable yes that's for sure 
[00:29:30]  little brats all right there you go uh we got the rape game we got the bed bugs we got uh  you know the bed bugs because i've been freaked out when i realized yesterday that i actually had  bed bugs for a good part of my life that is so creepy dude i thought they were a little summer  beetles i had no idea summer beat even if they were summer beetles you're sleeping with bugs but they  would be like i live my parents you do now but they're microscopic yes i do they reside on women 
[00:30:00]  yes well i can see where they are actually as long as i don't have the bug if you know what i mean yes  but i would sleep it was a it was a twin bed and on my floor in front of me would be like it was  encarpeted and it was all like stuff i had strewn about was it garbage like uh fast foods no no no  leftovers or anything never food clutter just clutter i'd like move notebooks i'd see a couple  of these black bugs and i'd see them in my bed once in a while they were absolutely bed bugs  i had them for years i didn't know what they were bed bugs nip at you don't they probably were 
[00:30:30]  eating my dead skin they nip at you i lived with i lived with a tick uh what tick infestation  not ticks uh what am i saying fleas oh please oh the fleas i went through a phase i got it with  fleas yep it i don't know what's worse i would bet you fleas are worse but not these are horrible  when they bite you the itching that it causes will drive you nuts my uh my ex-wife uh of course 
[00:31:00]  had to have had to have uh cats yo why do i end up with crazy cat ladies jesus anyway she had cats  of course i have one was one of four yeah cats and uh we lived in this like cottage like thing that  was behind a house at one point and it was nothing but in an open field and the fleas got in that  house and you i'd walk around with white socks on and there would just be black specks all over my 
[00:31:30]  yeah they jump up these are all fleas oh yeah ew oh yeah i i had it that bad too where you could  see them on your body and they're all over and they're in bed they were everywhere and they're  impossible to kill you i would see them on my arm ready to bite and i would try to swat and they  would just jump i did all the i gathered up all the laundry every piece of material in the house  went to the laundromat it's like i had no washing machine threw everything in on hot and then uh while 
[00:32:00]  that was being done set off like bombs in the house and uh that worked for a week i was like finally got  rid of the fleas a week later there's a couple of specks on your socks oh you just don't go away out i was  more more than skeeved out i was angry and in pain because you're just itching your ankles like you  know and to the point where you're bleeding i don't know what they have in them but when they bite you  the itching it causes is a nightmare oh it's not just a little nip where you could put something on  and go ah it'll heal all those it just keeps itching and itching it's turned into one big tick for me 
[00:32:30]  i don't think fleas actually skeeve you out it's more of just a an over-the-top annoyance like i  think bed bugs are more of a skeevy thing than fleas fleas are pretty small right they just can't  really see them and they just boing and they're gone fleas just make you really angry but fleas  infest you where you can't see them they like in a carpet fire like bed bugs if you got rid of your  mattress you could probably get rid of bed bugs if you cleaned up the area vacuum and got rid of your 
[00:33:00]  mattress fleas could be on the roots of your skull yeah yeah you don't see bed bugs in your socks like  bed bugs i think are easier to get rid of than fleas and fleas lay eggs places yes and then uh you  could get rid of the fleas and then in a week or two you you're reinvested oh the bed bugs are a bigger  problem than you know and they do get in your clothes and you have to freeze your clothes for eight  hours to kill the eggs and the bed bugs okay well fine see they like to blob yeah exactly drop them in 
[00:33:30]  the arctic well we got a story on bed bugs this is uh happening right now pearl edwards a medical  administrator will never forget what she found in bed with her four years ago i started feeling some  bites and um i pulled back the covers and i saw bed bugs squirming all over the sheets bed bugs are  tiny insects that feast on blood and they can live almost anywhere furniture wooden furniture sofas  chairs chairs within walls behind pictures they easily dress hide in luggage so very many places 
[00:34:00]  able uh a little creepy black bugs always be in the corner of the bed really that's probably where they  nest they were nesting now i'm gonna go home and look to see if i got these things oh god if you got bed bugs 
[00:34:30]  No, I live like a human being now, so I don't have them.  You light a match.  I had my problems, but I don't think I got the bed bugs.  Bed bugs are very resilient pests.  They can creep up on you day or night.  You might be sitting on the couch at 4 or 5 in the afternoon,  and the bed bugs in the couch will feed on you and then go back and hide in the couch.  They're not considered a health risk because they do not spread disease,  but psychologically, they can be devastating. 
[00:35:00]  You'll never be the same after because it totally messes with you.  Well, that guy said, he just casually goes, they feed on you.  Now, as they're feeding on you, do you notice that you're getting bit,  or are they just, like, taking dead skin off your body and then going back into the couch?  Look at that thing.  Yeah, but that's, like, when you blow it up there.  You can see them, though.  Look up bed bugs.  You can see them.  They feed on blood.  You can see them.  They don't eat dead skin.  They actually take blood out of them.  All right, so then does it make you itch? 
[00:35:30]  No, it just gives you a little tiny dot.  I'm getting itchy thinking of this.  I'm getting itchy.  Well, they numb, like, mosquitoes numb you before they bite you or whatever  because just before you don't feel it,  that's how they can feast on you while you're sleeping without waking you constantly.  So some of these things might have a numbing factor,  which enables them to poke into you without you feeling it.  But look at bed bugs.  Can you find bed bugs?  They creep up on you.  Bugs.  You see them.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  They are awful bed bugs. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Shane in D.C.  I think there were raccoons in your bed that many.  You would notice that.  Badgers.  Shane, what do you got?  Hey, I have bed bugs in my apartment.  They came from a filthy neighbor next door.  And they didn't bite me, but they bit my girl.  And I thought she was crazy because she showed up with this rash all over her.  And we finally found them in the bed.  And what a show to get rid of them.  Everything's got to go in bags.  The mattress has to be encased. 
[00:36:30]  And they come in and spray a powder around everything.  And we got rid of them.  You know what?  The end.  She probably was lying to you.  She probably was a meth head or something.  Yeah.  They bit her around the crotch and it got all red and itchy.  Oh, I see.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Bugs.  Is that what they call them?  It is a mental health issue.  We get hundreds of calls in our office about bed bugs.  Oh!  Bill Brewer is a city councilwoman on Manhattan's Upper West Side. 
[00:37:00]  She says complaints of bed bugs have risen by nearly 34%.  For years, Brewer has been trying to get legislation passed to help fight the bed bug battle.  Her latest campaign includes bills that would ban the sale of used and reconditioned mattresses,  one of the most common ways bed bugs are thought to spread,  train exterminators on how to properly get rid of bed bugs,  and require all city agencies to come up with a united strategy to deal with the issue. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Relax.  Calm down.  What are you talking about?  A united strategy to get rid of bed bugs.  It's like they're all kid operatives.  That picture is disgusting, Danny.  Look at the corner.  That's the corner of a mattress,  kind of underneath the little border thing they put on there,  that little, I don't know what you call it.  It's just part of a mattress fold.  A seam.  Yeah.  It's like 12 bed bugs in the crease.  Yeah, you just see these bed bugs in there and bed bug waste. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, God, that's disgusting.  Sam.  Who's buying used mattresses?  That's all I like.  I like to pile them up and just play them like a fort.  Who's using bed bugs?  Yellow stains on them.  And everyone.  It looks like Fantasia.  Everyone's buying used mattresses.  What?  Yes.  Yes.  No, they're not.  They can't afford new ones.  What?  You're either buying like a used one or you're getting one.  Who are you buying a new mattress from?  Or you're getting one.  Let's go to the phones. 
[00:38:30]  I guarantee we'll get 20 people in two seconds.  Who do you buy a used mattress from that you trust?  All right.  How about not even buying?  How about you're passing your mattresses on other people?  I've done that many times.  As a kid, the only time a mattress would be passed on is like, here, your brother got  older.  He gets a bigger bed.  You go to his bed.  And then your sister goes to your bed.  And then the little mattress gets thrown out.  I would bet money.  I don't know for sure, but I think I had one mattress the entire time I was living with 
[00:39:00]  my mom and dad.  18 years, one mattress.  Guaranteed.  I don't think they ever bought other mattresses.  It's been legal to recondition mattresses, to take them and recover them.  And that doesn't eliminate the bed bugs.  And there's no label that said this was a reconditioned mattress.  And that's what they're trying to do.  It's a huge business, actually.  Yeah.  That's why a lot of these places have really cheap mattresses.  Well, then don't buy the cheap one.  How long do you have a mattress?  A day. 
[00:39:30]  Actually, you have to get rid of one every day.  We're not talking about boogers on mattresses, Anthony.  I've had mine about seven years.  No, I think that's too long.  They tell you you should flip them every three months.  Well, I flip them, but not every three months.  I'm not flipping my mattress.  Yeah, maybe I will.  You get that spot in the middle of it.  Yeah, I do too.  My noise, then it's funny you should say that.  Yeah, it's cute.  So seven years is too long.  We're Sam.  Everyone's suggesting we do the beep game with the bed bug audio.  Ah, good idea.  Give it a shot.  See what it sounds like.  Sure. 
[00:40:00]  I'll hand it over to Snuggs Brain.  Sam's a pro at that.  Just got over.  All right, we'll take a few phone calls here.  Jared, Jersey, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Yeah, nothing.  I had bed bugs for four months.  It was the most horrific time in my life.  I woke up looking like a zombie every morning.  I didn't know what the hell was biting me.  Like, I thought it was my dog that gave me tics.  And I used to smoke cigarettes in my room, and I thought it was ash all over my mattress. 
[00:40:30]  And it turned out to be dead carcasses.  Oh, I'm itching.  I am itching.  Wait, dude, how did you get them?  Did you buy a mattress from somebody?  I think my douchey roommate picked up a piece of furniture off the side of the road and didn't clean it.  Yeah, that's great.  But you can give it to anybody, even if they sit down for two seconds on your couch.  They're going to hop in your pocket, and then two weeks later, they're in your house, and they multiply every two weeks. 
[00:41:00]  There you go.  It's horrible.  And the reason why he didn't get bitten, his girlfriend got bit.  It depends on how much heat you emit when you're sleeping.  They're more likely to bite you if you emit heat.  And that's how they know you.  They come out when you lay down on your bed because they feel your warmth.  They hide and then they come out at night.  That's what the cockroaches do.  You never see them.  They're rocking your house when you're sleeping, man. 
[00:41:30]  They hide in the nooks and crannies and underneath the mattress.  And then when your body warmth starts hitting them, they're like, hey, he's in bed.  Then they're all over you, coming out your mouth like Mr. Pratt.  And they sense your stillness, too.  Roaches and stuff can sense the stillness, which is when they know it's okay to come out at night.  And then your alarm goes off, and they just go back into the woodwork.  They actually hit snooze sometimes.  Into the woodwork.  A little roachy intense.  They're not finished eating your cake. 
[00:42:00]  Proving my point.  All college students buy used mattresses.  Instant feedback going nuts.  I just bought a used sofa bed on Craigslist.  This guy, I just got a used mattress from Ted's Used Mattress Emporium.  Wow.  If there's bed bugs, if there's no bed bugs, we'll provide them.  Oh, you provide bed bugs?  I certainly do.  Get a free bucket of bed bugs.  Free bucket.  Yes.  Multicolored like M&M's are adorable. 
[00:42:30]  Give you some companionship.  Yes, they're nice.  Don't ever be lonely.  When it gets cold and your warmth is on the mattress, they climb all over and stand on your ears.  They're classified as pests, Gregory.  Pests.  Pests, Mr. Pratt.  Thanks.  Mr. Pratt rules.  And he just pulled up Mr. Pratt from Creepshow.  Yeah, you can find that online.  The cockroach is coming out of his mouth and his chest.  That's just insane. 
[00:43:00]  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Yep.  Ugh.  Just come busting out of his chest.  Oh, that was a creepy episode.  Gary writes, every time Opie farts in bed, he's inviting bed bugs.  Ah, the warmth.  Yeah.  Well, the smell.  That's a double-edged sword.  That might keep him away.  This guy's sister had bed bugs so bad, she had to keep her clothes in plastic bags.  But how do you know that the bed bugs aren't in the plastic bag? 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Why don't you just sleep in a plastic bag?  It's quite clear.  Sip it closed.  Bed bugs make you itch like a madman.  A lot of phone calls coming in.  Do you know where I had bed bugs when I was growing up and I never knew where they were hiding?  Where, Ted?  In my hat.  In your hat?  Yes.  Hat bugs?  I thought there was just little black speckles which made it a fancy hat.  They were bed bugs.  Are they hat bugs then?  Yes, no.  Yes, no.  I would sleep on my hat. 
[00:44:00]  I would still go with fleas as the worst bug you could have in your house.  Oh, no.  Bed bugs don't sound fun whatsoever.  Cockroaches.  Cockroaches aren't going to crawl on you, though.  Yeah, they will.  Not really.  Oh, yeah, they will.  Not really.  Cockroaches in your house.  I've had fleas crawling all over me and biting me.  I've never had a cockroach that I know of walking over my body.  They skee me out because cockroaches will get in your food.  They will get in your food.  You'll open up your cereal and there they are. 
[00:44:30]  You don't really see the cockroach eggs.  How about opening up like pasta and those little worms are in there?  Like, oh, I guess I let that sit too long and these hatched.  You haven't lived until you, you know, pulled either the rice or the pasta or the cereal boxes out of the cabinet and you enjoy a nice bowl of cereal or some nice helping of rice.  And then noticed that the mice were eating right through the packaging.  Sharing it with mice. 
[00:45:00]  Welcome to the plague.  Wow.  Did I have it bad?  Do you know, I had the same thing in cereal, but it wasn't it wasn't bugs.  It was they were crows.  And I opened my cereal and crows flew out.  That is a pest problem.  I couldn't get over it.  I know we got to go to break, but Bill.  Your eyes.  Yes.  And then they flew back in the box.  We got to get to break, but Bill and Jersey, I don't want to lose this phone call.  Oh, Bill.  He just got back from Iraq.  Listen to this.  When are you going to become a law? 
[00:45:30]  He's dead.  Bill, what do you got?  Yeah, I just wanted to say when I was in Iraq, we had these things called sand spiders.  Yeah, I've seen pictures of them, too.  What's the sand spider all about?  These things are ridiculous.  We have a picture of one that had to be at least 10 times the size of a crab that you  would see in like a restaurant.  We have a picture of it.  It's enormous.  And these things attack you.  They're vicious.  If they bite you, it will decay your skin to the point where you have a giant hole in you. 
[00:46:00]  We used to shoot them with our M16.  We used to shoot those things.  But not only that, I woke up a couple of times with scorpions in my bed a couple of times,  too.  So bed bugs don't even scare me anymore.  Oh, is that thing creepy?  Wait, sand spiders?  Is that just a politically correct way to say it now?  Oh.  Oh.  Wait, wait. 
[00:46:30]  I'm spider rich.  Bill, we still don't understand how big these things are.  As big as your hand.  No, no, no.  They're supposed to be about three feet long.  But I have a picture of one, literally, that has to be at least four and a half feet long  and about, I'll say, about two and a half feet wide.  Come on.  He's eating a lizard.  Not counting the legs.  Not counting the legs on that thing. 
[00:47:00]  Come on.  That's a big monster.  We're YouTubing our asses off.  We can't find one.  This one is eating a lizard, though.  I got a picture of it, and I will send it to, what, opiananthony.com?  Off the air.  Hold on.  Off the air.  No, no.  Off the air.  Off the air.  I haven't checked that email account in five years.  So, wait.  These things hide in sand and you step on them?  Well, not really.  They're just all over the place.  Then they're vicious.  They'll attack you.  Those things are crazy.  You don't want them in your bed, for sure. 
[00:47:30]  Are they a good pet?  Oh, wow.  All right.  We're finding pictures now, my friend.  Damn.  That is insanity.  Google image sand spider, if you want to play along at home.  There's a couple of soldiers.  It's like from the waist down, they're showing these guys.  Holy crap.  They're dangling one, and it really is the size this guy says it is.  Wow.  It's a monster.  That is a monster.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's horrible.  That is a monster.  Yeah, that's not a monster.  I have a picture of one.  If you guys want me to send it to you somehow, I have a picture of one.  It's enormous.  Yeah.  But sand spiders, you close your door, you know you're safe. 
[00:48:00]  Cockroaches and the rest, they squeeze into these little crevices and get into your environment.  God, no wonder that place just sucks.  Yeah.  They got things like sand spiders.  They got monsters.  Don't even call them sand spiders.  Why does this guy have one on his face?  Is this a sand spider or no?  No, that's just a...  He's just being crazy?  Yeah, that's crazy.  Being kind of silly?  It could be dead because it's a picture.  You don't know.  God.  Hey, Bill, thank you.  Yeah, it's good to be back and listening to you guys, too, man.  I missed you guys for a year, so... 
[00:48:30]  You did all right over there?  Eh, I lost a couple friends, but hey, you know...  Sorry to hear that.  Sorry to hear that.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's all right.  Sorry to hear that, Bill.  That's okay.  Thanks, guys.  It's good.  I'm happy to listen to you guys again.  All right.  Welcome home, man.  Thank you, sir.  Bill in Jersey, everybody.  Thank you very much.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Doing a great job for our country there.  Sand spiders aren't real.  Josh, army guy.  Yeah?  Josh?  Yes.  Real quick.  If you go back to that picture, I just got back from a 15-month deployment, so start off. 
[00:49:00]  But if you look at the picture, there's actually two of them, one hanging on to the other.  Yeah.  And you'll notice that he's actually holding it way in front of him, like right up into the camera.  A little forced perspective thing going on.  Yeah, so it looks a lot bigger than it is.  But, I mean, I don't know if you guys do the discovery or animal plant thing or any of that, bull hockey.  But giant sand spiders are never on any list ever.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, maybe they're called something else, and you guys just nicknamed them sand spiders. 
[00:49:30]  Perhaps.  I'm getting itch.  There's a guy.  Go ahead, guys.  Camel spiders is what they're normally called.  What's that?  Camel spiders is what they're normally called.  All right.  We'll look up camel spiders.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, Opa, Google image banana spiders.  Those things make their webs across roads.  They're so big.  What?  How awful is that?  What is that?  Is that your car insurance?  Really?  It's eaten by an insect.  He's peeling back your roof.  We've got to take a break. 
[00:50:00]  We're going to Google image banana spiders and camel spiders.  We'll have a little update after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I told you yesterday I just was hanging around all day.  I was going through some more boxes of old radio stuff.  Stuff that was in, when I was living in Huntington, was just in the basement with floods and stuff.  I'm lucky that I didn't, you know, lose a lot of that. 
[00:50:30]  Lose it, yeah.  And then I threw it in my mom's house for a couple of years.  So I'm discovering some crazy stuff.  Stuff I haven't looked at in 10, 12 years easy.  Old stuff.  And yesterday I posted on my Twitter account a picture of you and I hanging out with Green Day.  Remember when Green Day was cool?  Yeah.  I don't want to piss off the Green Day fans out there, but when they were like kind of rebels  and really just going with the music before they went extremely mainstream.  Mainstream, man.  I got a picture on the Twitter account, Opie Radio, if you want to follow me. 
[00:51:00]  And it's me and Ant and the entire band hanging out at AF.  AF.  Somebody noticed that the picture was taken in front of a Real Rock TV banner.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  Holy mackerel.  No one gives a crap that the picture's being taken.  Yeah.  What's his name?  I forgot his name.  He's on his knees in front of Anthony squeezing the wacky horn, making it look like it might 
[00:51:30]  be Anthony's member.  Yeah.  One guy, I can't even say what one guy said about that very funny line.  He was, instead of saying that's your you-know-what, he said, no, that's actually one of Anthony's  blank.  Yes.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I can't even like, I can't even say it at all.  I'm watching your hand movements and I don't know what you're talking about.  I kind of knew the first one, but this one, you'd be like a little stretching motion.  It's a little, you know, the wacky horn.  So the bulb.  Oh. 
[00:52:00]  No, he was saying one, I'm just going to say it, pubic hair.  Oh.  Saying that's how gigantic you are, that it's just one of those.  Ew.  That would be disgusting.  That's what I thought was funny.  You should have kneed him in his face.  That was the day that-  Trey?  Yeah, Trey, thank you.  That was the day Green Day came in, was smoking pot like crazy.  Oh, there's your girl, by the way, that's Tiny Head.  Huh?  There's Tiny Head.  Is that your girl?  Yeah, we like her.  She looks like a giant ant. 
[00:52:30]  We like her, though.  It's the new traffic girl.  She's awful.  Her hips are so wide.  She's not awful.  She's trying to wear a dress that hides it.  She's got very wide hips and she's got a little bit of a bunt going.  She has gigantic hands.  Yes.  I'll give her that.  But her neck-  You know what?  You're going to piss off Danny and me.  She has a big neck, but then a little tiny head.  She does.  Her head looks fine.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, Danny and I are all over that.  I just can't get over the-  Like, her hips, they're ridiculous. 
[00:53:00]  Her hips are ridiculous.  Like, you could tell just by looking at her that she's got giant hands.  And like, because each one is just as big as her head.  Oh, yeah.  That body was made for sex.  And then her hips come out further.  If they're as big as her head, they could be A-cups.  She's got kind of a Kardashian hip thing going on.  Yes, definitely.  I have a thing for her anyway.  Kardashian is hotter, but this girl's all right, man.  She was Miss Connecticut.  You know, because of us, she was the number one Google trend yesterday.  I did see that.  And we didn't even, like, Google bomb her.  Just everybody wanted to see pictures.  It's hot, man.  It depends what she's wearing. 
[00:53:30]  Today, she's not wearing a flattering dress.  Not really.  Yesterday was perfect, though, because she was wearing, like, this red, like, this, like,  just sexy red dress.  And then the news is showing, like, full body shots of her doing the traffic.  Like, who does that?  Her head is a bit on the small side.  It's minuscule.  It's a bed bug head.  She has a person body and a bed bug head.  Sinks her head under your skin and sucks your blood.  It's terrible.  You can't not notice that giant neck and a little witty-bitty head.  So we're taking pictures every day. 
[00:54:00]  And when we get a really good one, we'll finally post it everywhere.  I'm not happy with today's outfit she's wearing, Vanny.  Yeah, because we've got to, like, do our girl justice.  I did say that to you because you could really see her hip definition.  She's fantastic.  She's trying to hold down the boobs a little bit today.  Yesterday, she wasn't.  They were nice and heavy and quite large.  Weighty.  Weighty, but in a good way.  I'm actually very jealous of that picture.  Oh, TwitPic.  I've seen it before.  It's a color shot of him and Kinnison in OP6. 
[00:54:30]  And Kinnison is still breathing.  But that's a damn good picture.  Well, are you wearing a shirt with a pretzel on it?  It's a sweater.  A sweater with a pretzel on it?  Is that what you're wearing, a blue sweater with a pretzel?  I posted this picture yesterday knowing full well that the abuse would be brutal.  Of course.  And for the people that think they, you know, were getting away with something, I purposely  cropped it so you could also see the horrendous jeans I'm wearing.  You don't think I could have cropped that better and just taken the sweater abuse? 
[00:55:00]  Damn it.  Yeah, sure.  It's a Cosby sweater.  I mean, when this picture was taken in the late 80s, I hate to tell you, but that sweater  was happening.  Is that a Van Heusen?  Actually, I don't think the sweater was ever happening.  I was a very poor, barely out of college kid, and I wore whatever I could.  And that is the truth.  Huh?  Well, I had better clothes.  I'm just bummed that that day I chose to wear the Cosby-looking.  Someone said, are you wearing a sweater with the Star of David on it? 
[00:55:30]  Ah, yeah.  The sweater is horrendous.  It really is.  And Kinnison looks cool as hell.  It's so distracting from the actual picture that it's like, wow, you're with Kinnison.  But all I'm looking at is that horrid sweater.  I know, man.  I know.  I met him and Lynn Fryer and didn't get a picture with either of them.  Just got signatures.  What a dope.  I think to be a genius, you need to have a huge head.  Because look at how big Kinnison's head is in that picture.  He does have a big head.  And then the Robert Plant picture I got, same thing.  Massive head. 
[00:56:00]  What's up with the big head and being a genius?  If he had kids with the traffic girl, it would be a normal, beautiful-sized head.  Absolutely.  She must be as dumb as a bag of rocks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but I got the Kinnison picture up yesterday with the stonewashed jeans.  Not only are they stonewashed jeans, they're not blue jeans.  They're a black version.  They're black stonewashed jeans.  Horrendous.  And the sweater is just, I have no excuse.  That's the late 80s.  I mean, I could tell you this much. 
[00:56:30]  I was making $8,000 in radio at that point.  I was part-time pizza delivery guy for the radio station, basically.  I was making no money.  No money.  And I didn't have a side job either.  I was like as poor as poor gets.  But I met Kinnison that day.  That was awesome.  But the Green Day picture was the day they were smoking pot and then destroyed the studio.  Remember that?  And now they're mainstream.  Well, you know, I'd rather, if I was a band, have a huge amount of hits than have a small following that gets mad when you get a huge amount of hits. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, you're 100% right, by the way.  We all hate when our band goes mainstream.  But you know what?  They're all hoping for mainstream success.  Of course they are.  So.  Unless you're Curt.  What was that one?  The last one.  That is me and Weez.  How old is that?  Well, the one is, you know, then and now, basically.  Can you zoom in on that, my love?  We're looking at an old picture. 
[00:57:30]  It's like a photo of Open Weez inside a photo of Open Weez.  It's like you guys are holding up a photo.  Inside a brandy snifter.  Yeah.  Well, no, I just, it was the same day of the Kinnison picture.  I also took a picture with Brother Weez.  Yeah, because I'm wearing the same awful sweater.  Oh, my God.  That better be the same day.  It really is.  Because I hope you threw that sweater away after you saw the picture.  Dude, I'm so bummed that the picture of Sam Kinnison, I have the horrendous sweater.  You look like Hilary Swank in that picture. 
[00:58:00]  Great, thanks.  Jesus Christ.  And the Weez one's a little farther away.  I have a shocked look on you.  When I was younger, I definitely had lesbian features, man.  Lesbian features.  Absolutely.  Was that his wife in the back?  No, that's Chris Shire.  She was like Weez's partner back then.  She went on to do morning radio in every market in the country.  And she was one of those spokespeople that went on TV and sold stuff. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, yeah?  She did very well for herself.  Go for her.  I lost track of her years ago, but let's move on.  Whatever.  So I'm going through the boxes and just popping pictures up every day now.  That's pretty cool.  That's some old pictures, man.  I'm being very choosy, by the way, because I got some pictures.  Oh, that are just.  Not flattering for you or myself.  Brutality, yeah.  Dude, you got to put the worst ones up.  The most horrendous ones.  All right, I'll do a few of those today.  Those are the best.  There's nothing worse than old pictures where you look terrible.  Dude, I got a picture I'll put up today. 
[00:59:00]  The abuse I'm going to get.  Horrendous.  I got like a stonewashed jean jacket on.  Stonewashed jeans.  I got the big, over-the-top, risky business sunglasses on.  I thought I was cool, man.  Someone should have stonewashed your head.  Why?  Wait, wait.  He's just throwing a rock at us.  Oh, wow.  This is the outfit.  Just throwing rocks at your head.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  You look like an idiot in old pictures?  Believe me, I got plenty.  My mother brought over one the other day from an old Rotgut gig. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, really?  Where I'm just wearing a cowboy hat and underwear.  Really?  Yeah.  And why not?  Did anybody go on stage wearing purple workout pants?  Was I the only one that wore the baggy workout pants?  Yeah, I didn't go with...  Please, please, I wore some crappy stuff.  I never did that, though.  What were they called?  Horrendous, dude.  They were workout pants.  Zubas.  What was...  Huh?  Yeah, I never did that.  Oh, they were awful.  I had my own awfulness, but I never went with that look. 
[01:00:00]  Well, Andy, did you post that picture?  Not yet.  I got to scan it.  People would love to see that.  Oh, I'll definitely put that up.  And I'm trying to share it with my wife, because these are boxes that, like I said, I haven't seen in a long time.  Yeah.  She's just laughing at every other picture.  Of course.  You got a mullet in this one.  You got stonewashed jeans in this one.  Look at the stupid Cosby sweater.  Because she doesn't remember those days.  Not the reaction I was hoping for.  She was but her little babe.  I was hoping for a nice reaction.  Like, wow, you did some cool stuff. 
[01:00:30]  Cool stuff in a pretzel shirt.  Well, I met Sam Kinison, though.  In a pretzel shirt.  In a pretzel shirt.  He was thinking about that sweater when he just veered into oncoming traffic.  Oh, I'm sure.  He couldn't get it out of his head.  He steered his car like it pretzels.  What is that person yelling?  Do we have audio of that?  Oh, no.  That can't be good.  There's a fat person yelling.  I think that's the 11-year-old that killed.  But that wasn't him, right?  That's one of the relatives, though. 
[01:01:00]  That's just a horrific story.  She was terrible.  Horrid.  All right, we had to do a little catch-up here, so we're going to take a quick break.  Can I announce something?  I canceled something.  I'm doing Leno March 16th.  So Bananas March 14th and 15th is being switched.  So if you have tickets for that, it's April 3rd.  Oh, Friday only I'm doing.  April 3rd.  So for the people in Poughkeepsie, I apologize.  But it was a switch, and that's the date they gave me, so I had to take that.  You could hear the cursing.  You've got to get the word out.  From here.  Yeah, but there was a lot of tickets sold.  So it's April 3rd, Friday only in Poughkeepsie I will be doing. 
[01:01:30]  Is it the Leno 10 o'clock show?  He's not doing that until June 1st.  June, okay.  This is one of the final months for his tonight show.  Wow, that's pretty huge.  You're going to get some fine viewership for that there, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm on with Julie Louise Dreyfuss, and I don't know who else.  Yeah, cool.  Was she ever in a show?  I don't think so, but I mean, she's an up-and-comer.  Yeah, okay.  All right, when we get back, we've got to talk about this rape game.  Now, this isn't flash video stuff, right, Ant?  Apparently not.  I think this is more involved.  It's from Japan, though. 
[01:02:00]  So, you know, whatever goes on over there, they're all out of their minds.  We'll get into it next, but there's a rape video game that a lot of people are not happy about.  Oh, really?  Not happy.  I just heard one woman.  There's one?  Not happy with her.  The one in the game.  Oh, I'm a little slow today.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, so what are people talking about today?  Dow Jones, lowest level since 1997 at the close? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  I think it's going to go up today, right?  Got it.  I don't know.  Some of the Asian markets took a big hit.  Based on.  But was that because we took a big hit?  I don't know.  And they did, and then we got up.  What do the futures say?  I have no idea.  I pulled my cash out.  Did you?  I bought a little Citibank.  Just to have fun with.  Yesterday.  So, like, I bought a few shares.  It was real cheap.  We'll see what happens today.  Can the media just shut their traps? 
[01:03:00]  Shut you, yep.  Because they were reporting yesterday that one of the big Citibank honchos was seen at the White House.  Yeah.  So that's freaking everybody out.  Well, we're actually giving a little hope in this case, maybe.  That would be a good thing, I think, at the Citibank.  But the media is just keeping this fear thing really going.  Yeah, but the market is going down.  Yeah, that's true.  Lowest since 1997.  Yeah.  Obama's going to be on TV tonight at 9, talking about the economic plan. 
[01:03:30]  Aaron, do you think it's going to be like that old newspaper we held up where at one point they're just going to be like,  Dow plunges 12 points?  What is that, 1974 or something like that?  Yeah.  And that was a big deal.  Yeah.  For the times.  And then the Oscars did pretty well.  36 million people watched the Oscars.  4 million more than last year.  I heard it was the third lowest watched ever, though.  Yeah, but you're a stat guy.  Yeah.  That's crap. 
[01:04:00]  People are watching the Oscars in different ways now.  This is true.  You can watch just clips of the people accepting in the winter.  You don't have to watch all that filler.  That's what I did yesterday morning.  I think it was Oscars.com or something.  They had everything nice and easy for you.  I bet you more people watch the Oscars now than ever.  Probably, yeah.  It's just that they're watching it differently.  You know that Slumdog Millionaire almost went straight to DVD?  Wow.  That came out yesterday.  That movie was almost not seen by anyone.  Because who watches straight to DVD? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  No one.  No one.  And then Fox, I think.  I think it was Fox's, one of Fox's companies picked it up.  Wow.  And distributed.  Warner Brothers, I think, passed on it.  Something like that, yeah.  But that movie that won everything almost went straight to DVD.  One of those straight to DVD, just nobody sees it movies.  I think a lot of people got fired over that decision.  Because you're so fired.  Because eight Academy Awards.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And then it turns out, what did we learn today about the Slumdog Kid? 
[01:05:00]  One of the kids.  One of the kids still lives in the slum.  And they had his mother on ABC News last night.  She lives behind a blanket.  Right.  A blanket suspended by ropes.  Right.  Does she have any clue how huge the movie was?  Yeah.  They said they were all watching it.  They showed a...  On what?  The blankets?  Where are they watching it?  They had all the kids gathered in the slum there with one TV.  And there were about a hundred of them in the midst of all this squalor.  See?  It's all... 
[01:05:30]  It was lavish.  Mm-hmm.  And they said the filmmakers have put a trust fund together for the two youngest actors.  And they will get it for their education when they're 18.  There's a weird thing going on over there.  I haven't lived that long.  I was watching CBS this morning, Sunday morning, whatever it's called.  And they were talking to people that live in the high rises.  Yeah.  That overlook the slums.  And they said you could go your whole life without walking those streets.  The slummy streets?  But how is that possible?  Because these things literally are right in the middle of the slums.  I guess everything is in the building. 
[01:06:00]  You think that's what's going on?  They probably have, like, everything you need in the building.  Sounds like paradise to me.  They say, yeah, you look down onto the slums, but we don't interact with the slums.  And, yeah, they're right there.  But we could go our whole lives without even walking among the bums.  Do you know how many...  That's basically what they were trying to say.  The bums.  Do you know how many bed bugs must be in that blanket?  Oh, God.  And roaches.  Do you think they have roaches?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Big ones.  You know, I don't even...  I think these people in the slums over there are happy, though. 
[01:06:30]  I don't think they...  What?  I don't think they understand fully their own plights.  Look at that big.  I don't know.  They just seem like they, you know, accept what they got.  Because they don't know any better?  I think so.  Once you give somebody something, then they start noticing how crappy things were.  Sure.  Sure.  And you don't want to go back there.  Yeah, they got a TV.  Knocking tin.  They got a TV that they plugged in so they could watch the Oscars.  It's in the paper tin.  Oh, is that it?  Is that the picture?  It's an old school TV.  Oh, God.  It looks like our TV here in the studio that we mocked. 
[01:07:00]  My God, they don't even have a flat panel.  It looks like they just took the antennas off the TV like last week.  Yep.  And they're all just sitting around watching the Oscars.  Is it cable or is it hooked up to an antenna on the roof, I bet?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  There's a couple wires.  Oh, there is wires.  Oh, my God.  We got to interrupt this fine conversation because we got one of the stars of the David and Bobo show  on the line.  Oh, no, is it Bobo?  Bobo's on the phone.  Bobo, hi, Bobo.  The David and Bobo show is coming.  It's the David and Bobo show. 
[01:07:30]  I think this will be a fresh voice in radio.  That's the David and Bobo show.  Oh, no.  He asks the best questions in the world.  David wants to know.  Someone's got to ask the questions.  Other people won't.  The David and Bobo show.  And David.  The David and Bobo show.  The David and Bobo show is coming.  Oh, no, David and Bobo.  You can listen every day when it's on.  You can listen. 
[01:08:00]  Jimmy hates that.  I use my headphones.  I can't listen to it.  That means Tim needs to make another one.  Please.  It's nails on a chalkboard.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, one half of the David and Bobo show is on the line.  It's Bobo, everyone.  Bobo.  Yeah, how's everything going, boys?  Hey, Bobo.  How are you, buddy?  I'm doing good.  That was some nice mentioning of me yesterday.  Some nice mentioning.  Well, we're trying to pump you guys up, you know? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I didn't call yesterday.  I wasn't home yesterday.  That's fine.  Bobo, what did you think of your show with David?  I thought it was an interesting broadcast.  Now, I have to admit, though, David sounded like a police interrogator.  Very good.  He did.  How annoying was that?  He sounded kind of amateur, didn't he?  Yeah, he did.  He said, well, he said, he said, he said, he sounded, he sounded like, he sounded like 
[01:09:00]  the police, he said, some kind of like police interrogator.  I could already imagine it already.  I'm just imagining any image I have, any movie I've seen.  All right.  You were asked the same question about how you got your name Bobo, like, three times  by this idiot.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I can't believe that.  I said it once.  I think you can kind of figure it out already.  Well, with that said, hold on one second, Bobo. 
[01:09:30]  This is what Anthony's referring to.  A little taste of the David and Bobo show, just in case you missed it yesterday.  This is the first ever edition of the show, and I want to get to know you a little bit.  So, first of all, you're Bobo.  What gave you the name Bobo, if I may ask?  My sister's been calling me that since she was a baby, and it just stuck with me.  She still calls it, she still calls me that to this day.  Well, why does she call you Bobo?  I mean, she could have picked, like, face, or she could have picked, like, clown, or whatever.  Like, why does she call you Bobo?  Where does that come from?  I don't know.  When she was little, that's how she said brother.  End of story. 
[01:10:00]  Brother?  Right, right, right.  End of story right there.  Right.  End of story.  I'm doing this.  She calls me Bobo.  Okay.  Why?  Well, when I was a kid, when she was a baby, that's how she said,  brother.  End of Bobo's story.  I've got to be honest.  I'm doing this to just agitate everyone.  Jimmy hates the promo.  You're frustrated by the fact that David can't drop anything.  But can I say, it was actually ended before that, because the first thing Bobo said was,  when I was a baby, she would call me that.  To me, that's where the story ended, because then David wanted to rest. 
[01:10:30]  You're right.  Why did the baby name you this?  You're right.  And let's not forget, we already explained to everyone why his name is Bobo before the  David and Bobo show started.  But you could even give him the, all right, she couldn't say brother, so she said Bobo.  A little too much information for the story, but even that, it should have been over.  Yeah.  He wouldn't let it go.  A little, that's how she said brother.  Should brother means Bobo?  How does that work?  I have no idea. 
[01:11:00]  If I could figure out baby language, I'd be a freaking genius.  Yeah, do you consider yourself a genius there, Bobo?  Well, I don't know a genius, but if I freaking knew that language, I'd be a freaking genius.  What language do you know, Bobo?  The only language I can speak is English.  You can't speak any other languages?  Nope.  What about Bobo language?  That's the same as English.  What does that mean?  That's the same as English, yeah?  He is so awful at just carrying on a conversation.  That's the beauty.  He's not even going to talk. 
[01:11:30]  Of the David and Bobo show.  No, he can't talk.  My favorite moment, probably in radio ever, is his lost question.  Yes.  All right, we can do that.  I just want to...  I like Lost.  Do you watch it on location when it's filmed on DVD yesterday?  Yeah.  Before, we can play that really quickly, just a part of that.  But the Bobo thing continued with this.  So, did you have a pretty good relationship there with your sister back in the day?  Yeah, she's only 13, so...  Oh, she's younger than you. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, she's younger than me.  All right, so how did she...  What made her start calling you Bobo?  I was like, you couldn't mention any other name.  Like, why that name?  Enough about the Bobo.  No idea.  That's how she said brother.  All right, I got you.  So, do you hang out with your sister a lot?  All right, I got you.  I see her every so often.  She's going out a lot.  But I don't know enough about the sister.  Yeah, exactly.  And this is what Jimmy was referring to.  Just how David asked the question.  Terrible.  This is the only part we're going to play.  Don't worry. 
[01:12:30]  So, Bobo, what are your plans this weekend, man?  What are you going to do?  This weekend, I'm going to visit my cousin.  I got a DVD box.  Got the Lost DVD box.  I've been trying to get him into Lost for quite a while.  Oh, you like the show Lost.  You a big fan?  Do you watch every week, every day, Lost, when it's on every week?  Every day, every week, Lost, when it's on every day, week.  He just doesn't know how to stop asking.  That's the best example of the wheels coming off you. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  All four at once.  All right.  Back to Bobo live today.  Bobo.  Yeah.  So, we kind of enjoy your participation in the David and Bobo show.  All right.  Thanks.  You all right today?  Yeah, I'm all right.  All right.  We're going to give you guys another shot on Friday.  Another 15-minute radio show, the David and Bobo show.  David is hoping, though, you come in early and you can, like, do some show prep. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  What time?  I don't know.  Like, you know, the usual, nine-ish.  All right.  I'll be there.  Well, Bobo, I got to say, too, David was kind of three under the bus a little bit.  He was implying that the problems with the show resided kind of on your shoulders.  Yeah.  He wasn't happy that he was teamed up with you.  That's his own opinion.  Yeah.  Okay.  Everybody thought you were the star, though, Bobo.  Oh, yeah.  So, don't worry about it.  Oh, wait.  The other half of the David and Bobo show is checking in. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, this is like an impromptu David and Bobo show.  Wow.  We're lucky.  We're lucky.  David.  David.  David.  Why would he call it on the call that worked?  Oh, there it was.  Why would he have a good call in?  I'm on a phone that works the phone.  Today, the phone.  I can barely, you know, get in his head when he's live in studio.  How are we going to make it work on the phone? 
[01:14:30]  Are you kidding me?  I love when you ask David a question and he just stares at you.  Yeah.  Like a retard.  Oh, yeah.  Bobo.  Bobo?  Yeah.  Bobo, what do you want to talk about on Friday's show?  Give us a little preview.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to be looking at the papers for stuff during the week.  Okay.  What are you, us?  No, I read the newspapers anyway.  Okay.  But, yeah, I'm looking especially for stuff that might come up that's going to be on the David and Bobo show. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  Do a little lifestyle, too.  Maybe something that people can relate to.  Maybe video games or the economy or sports.  Yeah.  You know, mix it up.  Mix it up a little bit.  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  I got it.  No problem.  Okay.  Do a radio show.  All right, Bobo.  If David calls back, then you call in, okay?  Or is David calling in right now?  No?  We're trying to call him?  Apparently, David is on Facebook. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  Okay.  And he's obsessed with it, I think, at this point now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just with just telling people to remove photos of him.  Yeah.  What was that, Danny?  Well, yesterday we were talking.  Somebody had posted like a separated at birth kind of situation with intern David and Louis Skolnick from Revenge of the Nerds.  Yes, of course.  So David doesn't understand that everybody could see what he posts.  Yeah.  So he comments on the picture and it just said, how do I delete this?  That's the worst thing you could do also. 
[01:16:00]  Because then more people will just keep linking him to the same picture.  Yeah.  He's inept.  Yeah.  How do I delete this?  That is.  Why would you print that publicly?  I know.  He's a boob.  This bothers me.  Yeah.  Don't bring this up in public.  I hate it.  All right, Bobo, we're going to let you go because I don't think David's going to call in.  Yeah.  Save some of this magnificence for your own show.  Yeah, please.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  No problem.  You guys have a good day.  When you're longer.  Yeah, we're all looking forward to the David and Bobo show this coming Friday.  The second installment on the way.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  All right, Bobo.  Thanks.  He's a star, that kid.  I'm telling you.  A star is born.  Oh, yeah.  David is the greatest.  How can he not be interviewing people?  Just fantastic.  Lost?  Oh, you like Lost.  You going to watch Lost next week when the Lost Day comes to the Lost?  We've got to get him doing celebrity interviews.  Absolutely.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  We've got 50 Cent tomorrow coming in on the satellite side.  We should have David do that and then watch him get his teeth knocked in.  Oh, God, should he at least ask him a few questions?  Absolutely.  Have David make sure he knows to do a little research on Fiddy and write up some questions  that he wants to ask Fiddy.  Right.  I just know what I want to talk to Fiddy about.  Guns.  Guns.  Guns, guns, and more guns.  He knows both ends of a gun.  Yeah.  The giving and the receiving end.  I think you're in opposite places, though. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Legal and illegal, huh?  I don't know.  I don't know what his...  Has he ever been...  I'll ask him tomorrow.  Yeah, let's ask.  How much trouble he's ever gotten into.  Also, we've got to give props once again to FatErock.com.  Oh, God.  Just taking over the world.  Just taking over the world.  You know what I was thinking what we could do with this FatErock thing?  We could post these FatErock pics all over New York City.  Just make it a thing.  Oh, wow. 
[01:18:00]  Just make it a thing.  Hold on.  Like that Andre the Giant stencil that's everywhere?  Yeah, that said Obey or whatever.  FatErock thing.  A little fun fact.  That Andre thing, right?  Same artist that did the Obama thing that everyone's talking about.  Are you kidding me?  Same guy.  That's the same guy.  Same guy.  Same guy.  I don't know if people know what we're talking about,  but there was a stencil that this artist did.  It was Andre the Giant.  It just said Obey.  It was everywhere.  It was everywhere.  And that same artist came up with the Obama thing, 
[01:18:30]  but now he's in a little lawsuit with the AP  because it's an AP photo that he took and then made artistic.  Kind of modified it.  Yeah, but yeah, we could do the Obey Andre the Giant thing with FatErock.  Just FatErock pics everywhere.  FatErock.  And then just put EAT underneath instead of Obey.  EAT.  Who wants to get this started?  Dude, FatErock, that's great.  Who wants to get the FatErock photo thing started?  I want to get to a point where people just call and go, 
[01:19:00]  oh my God, I saw another FatErock pic today in the subways.  You know what my favorite one is so far?  I was looking at all these.  Yeah.  Someone posted the original cover of the 50s blob.  Yeah.  Right?  And it's that guy and he's kind of like holding a stick.  But the way that the FatErock was over the cover,  it looked like the guy was poking Eric with a stick.  That's FatErock and it's the blob.  We're done.  We're going to get it for you.  That's great.  Why is FatErock getting dumped? 
[01:19:30]  Are you kidding me?  No, you can say FatErock.  You just can't make the website.  Why?  Why?  I was told it is because it's a naked woman's body.  That might be a naked guy.  Wow.  That's just amazing.  That's the message I got.  That's amazing.  Way to take the fun out of the show again.  Well, it's FatErock.  Yeah.  We love FatErock.  Just, you know, you'll find it. 
[01:20:00]  F-A-T-E-R-O-C-K.  I don't know what you'd do to get that on the internet.  Yeah, I don't know how that internet works, so whatever.  Yeah, well, I mean, if you wanted information about Eric with a K-Nagel, how would you go  about doing that on the internet?  Yeah, exactly.  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  Exhausting.  It really is hysterical.  It's exhausting.  Was Quincy in one of those?  It looked like Quincy was looking at FatErock.  What is that?  Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Shirtless Sam. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, FatErock.  Well, we're hoping the FatErock becomes the thing.  We're hoping we start seeing pictures of FatErock all over New York City.  Wait, how many pages of pictures are there?  17.  This thing hit yesterday.  There's 17 pics of FatErock in all sorts of different situations.  Where is Erock?  Can we at least ask an opinion on this?  Eric, can someone bring Eric in here?  Just someone roll Eric in here?  He's got to be...  Let's get the star of FatErock in studio.  I would say...  Erock.  Erock, you've got to be honored. 
[01:21:00]  And we're going to take this to the next level.  I'm telling you.  People are going to start posting this FatErock picture all over New York City.  Oh, yay.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  FatErock with the old picture of Fat Steve.  That's the one I submitted yesterday.  Oh, you submitted one?  I submitted four.  I submitted four?  Yeah, how this works is you submit a picture to FatErock, and then they put FatErock in  with the picture you submit.  Right.  Yeah, I submitted that one.  It's very easy.  There's one with Steve and a sandwich that I sent in.  Yeah.  There's a half-naked Sam. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, we saw that one.  Oh, that was you?  Yeah.  That was pretty funny.  Boy, you really got everybody, didn't you?  There's a thousand pictures of you.  Yeah.  I figured, you know, might as well join in.  And there's a couple with Big Kev, too.  People are saying, don't put...  Teasing hurts.  Don't put Erock on the signs.  Just say, eat.  The FatErock picture with just eat under it.  That's it.  You think we can get this going?  I think we can get this going.  Oh, so I'll get some of those posters that they use in the guerrilla campaigning and just 
[01:22:00]  throw them up all over the city.  And we'll post your pictures of the FatErock picture with the word eat on it.  See, that's unnecessary.  What?  What, you naked in front of the candy bar?  Well, this is...  The actual name of the store is Nagel's Candy Barn.  Oh, Nagel's?  Yeah, it's Nagel's Candy Barn.  Do we know for sure if that's a chick or a guy?  I don't know.  It's tough to say.  It's only debatable.  It could go either way.  All right.  So there you go. 
[01:22:30]  Props to FatErock.  It got our attention.  That's for sure.  Erock, would you be flattered if you started seeing this picture all over Manhattan with the  word eat under it?  Yes.  I think I need a t-shirt, too.  You want a t-shirt?  Yes.  Make him wear a t-shirt.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll regroup.  The rape video game, Anthony.  A lot of people up in arms about this.  It's very controversial.  Huh?  Hungry Hungry Hippos.  He's one of the hippos.  It's really easy.  You can really just get it on anywhere.  Yes.  Yeah, there's some really good ones. 
[01:23:00]  Garlic Butter Sauce.  There's a clove of garlic.  Yep.  Then plus sign.  And then butter equals Erock picture.  Yeah.  Fat Erock picture.  Fat Erock picture.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to go to the FU line as we go to break.  I think Erock started this site.  He loves it.  I've never seen a happier boy.  The Broken Seesaw one is one of my favorites.  That was pretty good.  It's a truck tipped up doing a wheelie because Fat Erock was in the back. 
[01:23:30]  See, that's where you could really get artistic with this.  When you can find a picture that works perfectly.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the best ever.  Yep.  There's one where it looks like I'm just ripping apart fish on a wharf.  It's really disgusting.  There's one where it looks like a forklift is carrying him.  Fat Erock.  Yeah.  Just get the picture and then the word eat, post it somewhere, take a picture of it being  posted and we'll throw it up on our websites.  There you go. 
[01:24:00]  We're going to go to the FU line as we take a quick break.  We'll get into that rape video controversy thing next.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, this is to my big fat ass ex-fiancé, Betsy.  Fuck you, you fat fucking cunt.  I got you in bed with my best friend last night on fucking Valentine's Day.  I hope you fucking die, bitch.  Next message. 
[01:24:30]  I have to give a big FU to dance in Syracuse, New York.  Thanks for getting me fired from your confidence.  You know what?  I'll be fucking your wife.  Have a good one.  Next message.  Hey, I want to give a big fuck you to that fatso that slapped me with a block in the box ticket the other day on Park Avenue, 51st Street. 
[01:25:00]  I hope you drop dead of a disease that hasn't even been invented yet, you fat fuck.  Next message.  I just want to give a big fuck you girl who gave me her number, waited a couple days, called her, no answer, no call back.  You know what, you bitch?  Go fuck yourself.  Next message. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, I'd like to send out a big tap to you to my appendix.  Thanks for getting inflamed and ruining my fucking weekend of bitching and drinking.  Fucking appendix.  Next message.  Hi, this is the fuck too for Thorian.  Thorian's my ex-boyfriend.  That's right, ex-boyfriend.  We're together for 15 years and he leaves me for some dumb cunt named Stephanie.  I wonder if our construction worker family know that their little son-in-law and brother-in-law would fucking talk for 15 years. 
[01:26:00]  How about them fucking apples?  And they're you, that's a good.  Call the OPNF, the FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Hey, we got JC on the line.  877-212-ON-A.  What's up, JC?  Hey, boys.  How are you, sir?  Hey, man.  Good.  And did your mom, uh...  And bad.  Did your mom force you to stop, uh, tweeting? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, kind of.  Rumor has it.  Why?  She wants you to do your homework?  Yeah, kind of.  Yeah.  I got carried away.  Doesn't want a little kid, like, getting into the internet.  Yeah, it's dangerous.  They got big plans for you.  They don't want you to be distracted by these social networking sites.  Exactly.  Great.  What do you got, JC?  I was just going to say that I post the, uh, EROC pictures all over my school for you guys.  Good boy.  Nice. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, let's do that today.  We're, uh, hoping that people start posting the fat EROC pics.  We're now officially allowed to promote the website because we learned that it is, indeed, a naked fat dude with EROC's head on top of it.  They thought it might be a woman, so all of a sudden they're dumping out of the mentions of FatEROC.com.  So it's FatEROC.com.  We're hoping that, uh, the pests take it upon themselves to start posting the Fat EROC picture with the word eat somewhere on the photo. 
[01:27:30]  How it's fine now that it's a guy is beyond me.  I don't.  It's more obscene, or at least more offensive.  It's way more disturbing.  To my brain.  Yes.  Yes.  With his big, huge man boobs that he's trying to hold up.  All right, JC.  I think you're getting the bit going with, uh, posting the pictures of the Fat EROC.  Woo!  Thank you, sir.  Woo!  All right.  See you later, guys.  See you later.  Later.  There goes 13-year-old JC.  He's got to be getting older now. 
[01:28:00]  What is he, 20?  We keep calling him 13-year-old, but, you know, he's had to have had a birthday or two.  Yeah, that's always fun, especially when we go up to Boston.  Hey, I've been listening to you since I was, uh, 14.  How old are you now?  Uh, I'm 27.  I got four kids.  Yeah.  How do my kids listen?  Really?  Great.  Thanks.  Fantastic.  All right, uh, oh, the, uh, the rape game, Anthony.  Yes.  I thought this was one of those silly flash.  No, no, apparently this is one of these, uh, games that were kind of put together a little 
[01:28:30]  better.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, it comes out of Japan.  Mm-hmm.  We've talked about some of these Japanese, uh, games and, uh, customs, little vending machines  with girls' panties in them and things like that that goes on in Japan.  Uh, they do have a weird ethic over there.  It's, it's, uh...  Don't yell in an argument.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't yell when you're arguing.  But tub girl?  Tub girl's okay.  Completely acceptable.  Um, used panties in, in vending machines, like I said.  And then, uh, they will, they will digitize any, um, uh, hair that is on a woman's lower 
[01:29:00]  region, uh, because that is considered, you know, taboo.  You cannot show that.  Mm-hmm.  Yet you can show horrific things being done with bodily, uh, fluids and, and, and things  like that.  So, I don't know what's going on with that culture.  Not a clue.  Oh, God.  I want to say something so bad. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah?  Uh, then you, you saw the Oscars with the guy accepting the award and couldn't speak  English?  Which one?  What did he accept for?  He was of, uh, Asian descent.  Yes.  And how he was talking and, and it's, can we just play the audio as if?  How about that?  I think we can.  Because he just says thank you a million times because he really doesn't know English.  And I was saying to a lot of people that I was watching the Oscars with, if we, uh,  played that bit and commented on it or imitated that guy, we would be not, not in trouble. 
[01:30:00]  We would be fired, which means you're not in trouble anymore.  Yeah, then you're out of trouble and out of course.  And I'm sitting there in amazement going, well, I got to stop right there.  It's taboo to even discuss it.  All right.  Here's the, the rape game coming out of Japan.  New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn outraged about the sale of a video game called  Rape Play and it's shocking and sick storyline.  Players stalk a mother and her daughters rape.  The news does realize that they're turning on, look, we'll acknowledge it. 
[01:30:30]  Just us doing this story.  We're going to turn a bunch of you guys onto this game.  You're going to check it out for yourself.  And the activity.  Yeah.  But the news plays it like you're not going to believe this.  And, and don't even want to acknowledge that because they're doing the story that so many  more people are going to know about the game than if they didn't say a word about it.  If they left it alone.  Yeah.  No one would know about this except for very few people. 
[01:31:00]  They're making the situation worse.  Yeah.  We don't carry the way.  We just like talking about this stuff.  It's a politician actually that jumps on this for, you know, trying, trying to get a little  attention, things like that.  For themselves, by the way.  Yeah.  Not for the, the, the people.  Oh yeah.  For the, for their, with the, with their constituents.  Constituent.  Constituent.  New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn outraged about the sale of a video game called 
[01:31:30]  Rape Play and it's shocking and sick storyline.  Players stalk a mother and her daughters raping them.  The game also allowing additional players to join in.  It isn't a game.  You cannot take rape or sexual assault, package it into a game.  It is a violent crime which destroys women's lives.  Well.  Let me put it like that.  There's plenty of games that, where you commit violent crimes. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  It's, it's a game.  It's, um.  It is a game.  How about this?  This, I mean, is a game.  Yeah, it's a game.  It's not a game that you like.  It's a game that's very offensive to a lot of people.  Sure, of course.  And, and rightly so.  Yeah.  I'm not going to sit here and say that that game and the, the concept of it wouldn't be  completely offensive to some people and, and probably, uh, uh, you know, very hard for  some people to accept that there's even a game like that out there.  But, uh, freedom of expression is a, it's a tough nut. 
[01:32:30]  You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta deal with it.  You're, you're allowed to put out things like this that offend people and you're allowed  to, you know, voice your opinions on it.  Yeah.  But again, don't try to shut down things or legislate against it or make laws and rules  and blah, blah, blah.  Uh, just leave it alone and no one would even know about it.  Right.  It goes away.  Well, uh, speaking of that, Anthony, at this.  I'm watching some stilt from the game.  Yeah.  Oof.  Speaking of, uh, of that, Anthony, uh, we now know of the game thanks to the news, uh, 
[01:33:00]  channel.  Yeah.  And now thanks to the news channel, we're going to learn where we could, uh, get it for ourselves.  Oh, nice.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Idiots.  Thank you, news.  The game made by a Japanese company called Illusion, which has other sexually violent  video games, has been on the market since 2006.  Although not in mainstream stores, it is available online.  Anti-violence advocates and city politicians calling on U.S. video game distributors to  stop sales, urging all New Yorkers to boycott the game and stores that sell it. 
[01:33:30]  That's wonderful.  But because you're saying all that, you're actually going to help the sales.  That's just how it works.  Yeah.  Oh, keep your mouth shut.  But boycotting, it's once again, don't allow people to do what they want to do as adults.  Think for other people.  That's what we like to do in this country.  We think for each other.  Yeah.  We're just, we're just a bunch of hens.  Yeah.  We're just sheep. 
[01:34:00]  If you let something like this pass by, like, oh yeah, there's this rape game and nobody  speaks out about it, then it becomes something that people just think is just sort of a regular  part of our world.  In light of the recent controversy, online retailers like Amazon and eBay have now pulled  rate play.  I want to thank those companies like Amazon that have stopped selling it.  That said, you should never have sold it.  It's good.  You're not selling it.  But think twice before you ever put a product like this up for sale again. 
[01:34:30]  So I guess it's okay on Amazon or any other place to sell a novel where there's a rapist,  a violent rapist.  How about American Psycho?  There you go.  American Psycho is a great book.  I've read it three times by Breddy Snellis.  And it's a movie with Christian Bale where there's women being chainsawed.  Oh, is it?  Oh, good for you.  I've read it three times.  I'm passionate. 
[01:35:00]  It's going through the pages.  Da, da, da.  I'm passionate.  But when it gets into entertainment, that's acceptable.  And that book, if you read, that's why I won't watch the movie because I've asked about  six or seven specific violent scenes in the book that are not available.  You've never seen the movie?  No Desire.  It's great on its own.  Maybe you should look at it as just a different project.  It is good.  And Christian Bale puts on a completely different voice.  Really?  Yeah.  He talks like a real person.  But when you look at entertainment like that, so how is that okay to read, but it's not okay? 
[01:35:30]  It's like it just gets too diluted.  You just have to let it go.  I think she assumes, put in game form.  See, a lot of people, especially politicians, people that really don't know about computers,  the gaming industry, things like that, they assume every single game that is put out is  made for children.  Do you think this woman has ever sat in front of a computer or an Xbox or a PlayStation and 
[01:36:00]  played a goddamn game?  Never!  They only think kids are playing these games.  Right.  By the way, Frank.  Jesus.  Frank.  Frank.  What's the matter, Frank?  Say what you have to say.  Okay.  Here we go.  What makes you guys, what makes you guys so different from the news and reporting this?  Frank.  Were you listening to what I said?  I said, we don't care.  We're going to acknowledge that doing this story will turn people onto this game.  We made sure we said that. 
[01:36:30]  So the news should say the same thing.  The news should say, here's a report, but by the way, we're aware we're going to turn  you onto this.  That's ridiculous.  But they would never do that.  They would never do that.  Obviously, they wouldn't do that.  Why would they do that?  We're saying we don't care if you're turned onto this game because we're doing a break  on it on our show.  Of course you don't care.  But the media is doing it because it makes for great viewing, and they are well aware  that people are going to go check it out.  You're telling me if the news didn't report this, you guys wouldn't report this?  We would.  Frank, here's what you're wrong about.  I would not have known about this game if I did not see it on TV. 
[01:37:00]  If you heard about it on the side and not on the news, you wouldn't sit there and report  on it?  Yes, we would not report.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  This isn't a news show right here we're talking about.  This is our show.  Can I talk for a second and just let me get my point across?  That's a good slam, Frank.  Let me get my point across.  I'm saying this isn't a news show.  This is an entertainment show.  This is a show about what we find interesting.  And yes, we are gamers on this show.  So we know a lot about what goes on in the gaming world.  And we would bring this up and talk about it. 
[01:37:30]  And not in a way of, this is horrible and should be taken off.  And meanwhile, give all the information about it on the air.  That's being hypocritical.  We're talking about a game that, you know, I'd like to see it.  I don't care.  I could give a crap if this game is sold to anybody.  It doesn't bother me.  Okay.  So why am I a hypocrite?  So why am I a hypocrite?  Because you're saying that the news is ridiculous for talking about the story because they're  turning people on to it.  About doing the same thing that you're doing right now.  But they're...  But they're... 
[01:38:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You're criticizing the news because they're not going to give it a caveat of, oh, but we  understand we're turning you on to this.  Obviously, they're doing that.  But they're just talking about the outrage that's being experienced from the game.  Right.  They're reporting on that side of it.  Yes.  They're not there to talk to you about the game.  Yes, they are.  And by the way, Fred...  No, they're not, Jimmy.  Yes, they are.  And here's the problem.  First of all, the news operates under a different umbrella of what they're allowed to do.  The news is allowed to get away with a lot more. 
[01:38:30]  And yet, they are driven by the same stuff we are.  They can say and show things that we can't show because they're under the umbrella of  we're the news and they're being dishonest about what their motives are, which, again,  is to keep viewers.  It's to find things that are titillating.  That is not...  But they don't say that.  They're not going to say that.  Then they are dishonest.  We are honest.  So we're not being hypocrites.  We're being truthful.  Yeah, we're kind of showing this because we think it's cool and interesting and dirty. 
[01:39:00]  They're not doing that.  They have mock outrage when they are also driven by ratings and viewership and advertising,  the same as we are.  So it's not being hypocritical.  We're telling the truth about what our motives are.  They're not trying to be educational or informative.  Don't be naive.  He hung up, by the way.  Whatever.  Don't be naive.  There is definitely a big difference.  The news is not trying to be educational.  They're not trying to inform you so you make better choices.  Like Jimmy said, yes, they're all about ratings, too, and they know this is going to get people's 
[01:39:30]  attention and make them watch their dumb show.  They compete for the story.  They fight it out for who says it first.  They're obsessed with watermarking.  They're obsessed with...  We have the exclusive.  Why?  Because that's going to bring more people to you, and that's going to therefore generate  more advertising dollars.  Fine.  But don't lie about what it is.  Society in general will be better off when we all realize that the news is in goody two  shoes.  They're there to be shocking just like anyone else in entertainment.  What a naive dummy. 
[01:40:00]  They're all about shocking you and getting you to watch their program.  He sounds like a member of the media.  They don't take the high road ever.  Who doesn't like the fact that the organization he's a part of is as transparent as they are.  Right.  Right.  We don't pretend to be what we're not.  This is a radio show.  We try to make people laugh.  We don't care if we're obnoxious.  And honestly, I don't care if I offend people, and I don't think these guys do either.  No, they don't give a crap.  I mean, you and Ann, I don't think we're not...  We don't care if we offend people.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  We're not pretending to be informative.  Right.  They know exactly what they're doing.  Shut up.  My God.  They didn't have to hang up, bro.  Yeah.  He hung up.  It's like...  There's such a difference between the two.  Such a difference between us discussing this and the news discussing it and a politician discussing it.  There's three different agendas there.  Do we have an agenda by talking about it?  Of course we do. 
[01:41:00]  We're filling up time for an entertainment show.  And it's interesting, I believe, to our listeners and our demographic and people that are like us, that like gaming, want to see what's out there.  No matter how sick it is, it kind of gives you like a, oh, my God, uncomfortable laugh when you think of somebody actually making a game of that.  But that's totally different than the news who, in the way they report it, are editorializing at how horrible this is.  You'll hear the newscasters say, like, the terrible game or something awful. 
[01:41:30]  This will shock you.  You know, so they're telling you it's bad.  We're not saying anything.  We're just like, hey, here's what it is.  And it's also an ongoing thing with our show, these politicians that find the shocking video games and make a big deal about it.  And most of the time they get nothing done as far as changing how these video games are out there for people to play.  And then you wonder, what could this politician have been doing that would have been much more helpful to their constituents? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Consciousness.  They all go for the easy video game angle to get their name in the paper.  You know, it's a joke because they don't want to do the real heavy lifting and really acknowledge what's going on in their community that they're supposedly, you know, there to help.  And the news is just being dishonest about the exploitive nature of a lot of their motives.  And that's what's aggravating is the titillation that, you know, according to the FCC with certain things, you know, you can't do certain things to pander or titillate. 
[01:42:30]  But if you're under the umbrella of the news, you have a tremendous amount of more leeway.  You have much larger margins, which you can operate in.  And, you know, they use that to their advantage.  Sure.  So don't act like they're practicing this higher form of the art, Frank.  They're not.  People are losing their homes left and right, losing their jobs left and right.  And this dopey politician is going after a game, which, by the way, is three years old. 
[01:43:00]  In the video game world, you know how old three years is?  A long time.  That is a long effing time.  But let's deal with this sick video game instead of real issues like, you know, how we keep people employed and how we keep people in their houses.  That's why I hate these politicians.  What that dumb broad politician should be legislating for is maybe castration for rapists or maybe life imprisonment without parole for second offense on. 
[01:43:30]  Like, you want to stop rape?  Don't go after a video game, you dummy.  Go after the people that are currently incarcerated for rape and getting out and committing the crime again.  How about you have them in a car?  If you fight for longer prison sentences, that's how you get things done.  You sensationalizing idiot.  Right, exactly.  Go away.  All right.  I don't know what to do with this.  I could tell you this much.  I was watching the Oscars.  And I don't know what I could say. 
[01:44:00]  I'm just going to play this.  I liked this little segment of the Oscars.  Okay.  A guy accepting his award.  So, yeah, let's listen.  It's so heavy.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, my supporter.  Thank you, all my stuff.  Thank you, my pencil.  Thank you, Academy.  Thank you, animation. 
[01:44:30]  Thank you, my company, Robots.  Thank you, Mr. Roboto.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  That's a song.  That guy gave a little Mr. Roboto reference.  Wow.  I thought he was playing Battleship.  Can I say that?  I think I can.  That's pretty funny.  Remember that stupid commercial where the brother and sister are playing? 
[01:45:00]  And he goes, sis, you sank my Battleship.  Then he takes her, tears her pants off, and gives her the old torpedo.  Yeah.  And then she looks through his drawer and finds all her missing underwear.  She says, forget the Battleship.  Why have you been wearing these on your head running around the house?  Eric from Virginia Tech, very confused.  That was not Andy Kaufman.  No.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  The Latka character, I do believe.  Battleships sucked, by the way, because it was too easy to move your Battleships around.  Cheat. 
[01:45:30]  I so cheated.  Oh, my God.  I so cheated.  It's based on honor.  Well, great.  Like our military and our Navy.  You know what?  You don't move your ship.  I grew up with four brothers.  We were always competing, and I had to cheat to be the greatest brother of all time.  That's why they had to come out with an electronic Battleship for people like you that cheated.  It was an art to move your Battleships without anyone knowing, by the way.  It's like, what are you doing down there?  What are you doing with your hands?  What?  Nothing.  You moved your ship. 
[01:46:00]  You moved it.  And then you can find out you moved it because you look at the pattern of your pegs and realize,  I knew a ship was there.  Yeah, but you have to know how to do it.  You allow them to hit, and then you do a little twisty on your Battleship because they're thinking  they're going to go this way with the next, you know, hit.  So you can kind of rotate a little bit.  You ever put your carrier and your Battleship in like a T or an L formation, hoping that when they wipe one out,  they won't think that you're going to have another one near there?  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes that backfires, though. 
[01:46:30]  It backfires because sometimes they'll go halfway up the Battleship and hit one with the carrier  and then like three with the Battleship and be like, wait, that should have been sunk because  that's like four pegs.  And then you'll, oh, I see.  You got a couple there.  Damn it.  I used to pile them all together, too.  Oh, you're in a big cluster?  Well, with the hope that as long as they don't hit that cluster, you could go forever.  But as soon as they hit that cluster, you know what you're up to?  Oh, my God.  Then you're trying to hide your arm movements? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sitting there like Christopher Reeve, only moving your fingertips.  I got to get one of these out of the cluster.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was how I cheated, though.  You'd look right at your brother, hoping he's not looking at your hand, like, all right, what's your move?  You slide a hand, guy.  I'm trying to distract.  Like, you know, a girl in a skirt come out with a top hat and a rabbit.  What do you guys think?  They're starting to make the fat E-Rock.  Oh, it's great.  That's pretty good.  Oh, that is good. 
[01:47:30]  We can put that online for everybody on onlyradio.com.  And maybe they can print it up, or is that too outrageous for the lawyers?  It's so outrageous.  Hey, can we find one of those old Battleship commercials where him and his sister are having a good-natured game of Battleship?  Yeah, please.  Let's find that for after the break.  No one mentions the drunken father?  How great would that have been?  You sight my Battleship and a whiskey bottle flies into the frame and crashes against the loud game.  Just got to acknowledge if radio show hosts imitated the guy we just played, they would be fired. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  I mean, there's so...  Which is insane to me.  There's so much there.  You can have a lot of fun with that in a good-natured way.  Of course.  And I've talked to our Asian listeners.  We do have them.  And they're like, we're fine.  You can goof on us like you goof on everyone else.  I don't know what the problem is.  For some reason, we have to treat you special because you're much too sensitive to take any type of ribbing, any type of joking. 
[01:48:30]  But even in an endearing way, because that was kind of endearing.  The guy gets up there and gives a speech.  He can't really speak English very well.  But he had the crowd at the end.  He did a Mr. Roboto thing and gets a laugh.  Sure.  And then he's off.  So, just to be able to comment on how he was saying certain words would be funny.  But, dare I say brilliant, you go to Japan and get a laugh not knowing their language.  How would you do that? 
[01:49:00]  You'd get a laugh.  Just try to talk.  Try to say anything in Japanese.  But then get a real laugh where they're laughing with you, not at you.  Can you do that?  Can you go to Japan and do that?  Let's flip this.  If I had a bathtub and just ate a bunch of grapes and cappuccino.  No, if you showed a married couple having sex on their wedding night where it was loving and gentle.  And they would all laugh and crack up.  What is this?  Why isn't she crying?  Why is there nothing being sprayed on her?  Is that dress still white? 
[01:49:30]  Hey, it's Black History Month.  We're coming to the end.  We only have a few days left.  Yep.  Right?  Wow, Friday's it as far as Black History Month goes.  Wow, that's it?  That went fast.  Here's today's honoree.  Is that the end?  To celebrate Black History Month.  Sorry.  What did you want to say?  I was going to say, is that his entire term?  What do you mean?  I thought it was just for Black History Month.  Oh, boy.  You've been so good.  That we have about...  Oh, no, it's four years?  You've been so good.  All right, I didn't know.  You've been so good. 
[01:50:00]  I've been proud of you, matter of fact.  I've been so proud of you.  Chick.  Rock's gonna take his money.  Yeah.  Giving all up to me.  What?  Well, apparently he is.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I hope that $12, $13 people get from the stimulus package really boosts the economy, by the  way.  Great job.  Yeah.  It'll help some people. 
[01:50:30]  Will it?  Uh-uh.  If they pull it all together...  It'll help.  ...and then whoever gets it, they have a lottery.  What is it?  $13 a month?  $13 a week.  A $13 a week?  A $13 a week?  $13 a week will, believe it or not, Anthony, help a lot of people.  $13 a week?  They're having a lottery for $13?  No, it's a stimulus package.  That will help a lot of people.  That's the average person's share of the reduced taxes and payroll taxes mostly.  So that's like $500, less than $600 a year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You couldn't get anywhere in the India slums with that.  It's a nonsense... 
[01:51:00]  How about the money we're giving to Gaza?  Was it $900-something million?  Yeah.  Divvy that up.  How about that gets divvied up among Americans and we don't give it...  I don't even care if it's Israelis or Palestinians.  How about we divvy that up among people that are here and stop giving our money away to  other countries?  That's too logical, Jimmy.  A bunch of dopes we are.  Too logical.  All right, Black History Month.  Here's today's honoree.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic  African-Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today. 
[01:51:30]  Today we honor Marvin Berry, lead singer of Marvin Berry and the Starlighters, who played  at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance at the Hill Valley High School.  When a hand injury incapacitates him, replacement guitarist Marty McFly dazzles the crowd with a  musical style unheard of in 1955.  Chuck, Chuck, it's Marvin!  Your cousin Marvin Berry!  You know that new sound you're looking for?  Well, listen to this!  How about that? 
[01:52:00]  A black man stealing music from a white man.  That's a first in our book.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  What else is going on in the world, Ant?  Anything?  Nah, just kind of a weird day today, news-wise. 
[01:52:30]  Just hanging out at home now, loading movies.  That's my new thing now.  I'm just a movie maven over the house.  You should have seen my mother and Sal over there.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Row, it's like we're in a theater!  Just yelling.  Row!  The theater's done, right?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  They got to do a few little things.  I told them about it.  A little tweaking?  Yeah.  Well, one of these processor units from Canada. 
[01:53:00]  It was on the fritz.  So my regular TV.  Sound like this.  Oh, really?  And I was like, that better be fixed before Lost comes on.  Because I watch Lost every day, week, when it's on every day, week, every day.  Of the week.  Of the week when I watch Lost.  Day.  Day.  Week.  Yeah.  Lost.  I want to watch it downstairs.  But I was watching the opening scene to Saving Private Ryan. 
[01:53:30]  Nice, right?  And wow, yeah.  It's really sick.  All the subtle little sounds you hear of gushing guts and bullets pinging off the metal.  Yeah.  All that kind of stuff.  I noticed one thing, though.  And I don't know.  I guess after a while when you get used to it.  Because it's like a new toy.  This whole theater thing.  I find myself just watching the highlight clips of movies. 
[01:54:00]  I'm really sitting and watching an entire movie.  What?  Yeah.  I sit and just go.  I watch something.  Then I go, I want to see this part of the movie.  That's pretty cool.  Well, you've seen it, right?  Yeah.  A lot of the movies I've seen before.  But there's a few.  And then I was watching the part on Alien yesterday when the ship leaves and lands on the planet.  That's a great scene of the ship shaking.  If you get a lot of action and a lot of sound, that's where it really kicks ass.  Nice. 
[01:54:30]  To be sitting there and doing that.  How far away is your first seats from the actual screen?  First seats from the screen.  I don't know.  What would you say, Danny?  Probably 10 feet, I guess.  That's a good guesstimate, sure.  10 feet.  That's watching the honeymoon.  I was watching the honeymoon.  That's him actually at the scene going, hello, Bill.  Really?  He's putting the pen in.  I took that picture.  Hello, Bill.  Even the honeymoon has got to look good on that screen in that theater of yours.  It's hysterical.  Wow.  It's a lot of fun. 
[01:55:00]  I can't wait to have people over.  Wow.  You make a lot of money.  No.  I spend a lot of money.  See, there's a big difference.  I spend a lot of money.  And I save a lot of money.  Yes.  Another difference.  I do neither.  Wow.  All right.  We got two.  So that's what I've been doing.  Very cool.  I'm helping out the economy.  I'm buying things.  See?  You've got to buy things.  I'm buying things.  All right.  We're going to go back in time a little bit. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, back to the future.  Cool.  Which timeline?  No, this is going to be a little chuckle for everybody.  Reminds me of a simpler, nicer time.  I don't know what this is. 
[01:56:00]  Just a little VG for a moment.  Oh, I was listening to the words.  That's the key.  That anyone can get VD.  VD.  If you're curious or confused, get information or a pamphlet at most pharmacies or a health 
[01:56:30]  clinic.  If you need help, see a doctor.  VD is for everybody.  Wow.  Who knew?  From the 70s, yes.  Well, the 70s, they should have been concentrating on something else they didn't know about.  That was percolating in the bathhouses.  Oh, boy, was it?  And discos.  It was bubbling.  Yeah.  VD.  That was nothing.  It was bubbling and decided to hit the streets.  Talking about the clap?  VD.  That's nothing.  I almost remember that now.  It's for everybody. 
[01:57:00]  Not the commercial, getting VD.  Yeah.  In the bathhouse percolations?  Yes.  The brew was a-bubbling.  Oh, yeah.  I watched that.  Mm-hmm.  Do we have that Battleship commercial or no?  They're working on that.  Battleship.  That was a good one.  You sunk my back.  Or Connect Four.  Where?  Here, dummy.  Lydia.  Oh, hi, guys.  Hi, Lydia.  Oh.  Hello.  I dreamt about you two nights in a row while I was on vacation. 
[01:57:30]  Wet dreams?  No, they weren't wet dreams.  But they were very odd.  Were you driving when you had these dreams?  That'd be a great story.  Yeah.  No?  What was your dream?  The first night, I dreamt that I was going on stage with a rock band and Anthony was in  the audience.  Hopefully it was great white.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Actually, black flag.  Uh-huh.  Black flag. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  Okay.  And wanted to make sure that I was making the right decision about my career and doing this.  And I really appreciated his concern.  And the second night...  Extreme person.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear.  Shut up.  Okay.  Keep talking.  Good.  No, keep talking.  The second night, I dreamt that all three of you were over my condo where I was staying 
[01:58:30]  and wanted to come with us to doof me, which was really odd.  Your life sucks.  You have awful dreams.  You have the worst dreams ever.  You could be anything in your dreams.  Yeah.  Why not have an all-out gangbang with us three?  What is wrong with you?  Your dreams are awful.  Open up my mind.  Sorry, guys.  Wasn't on my mind.  Your dreams irritate me.  Ugh.  I had a dream about...  Why don't you live a little?  Yeah.  Have fun in your dreams.  You can do anything.  You can fly for God.  Exactly.  I know you're a fuddy-duddy in your real life, but in your dreams, you know, be a slut. 
[01:59:00]  Maybe I'm so excited in my real life that I need to be a fuddy-duddy in my dreams.  Yeah.  I had a dream about you.  It's where you picked up your phone and the two was missing.  And so you kept thinking about calling in, but you couldn't.  I'm going to call you on speed dial, Jimmy.  Sorry.  We're still waiting to see a picture of you, Lydia.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Uh, yeah.  I don't think I'm going to do that. 
[01:59:30]  Why?  You couldn't see me in person.  Well, I don't trust you.  Well, just...  I don't trust with what?  Just how about...  Just put a piece of, like, steak over your face.  Just your body.  Well, she says she's, uh, better looking than her voice, so...  Well, that ain't saying much.  It has to be.  We're a bit curious about this, Lydia, now.  Stop.  Yeah, I...  I would not mind you seeing me in person, I...  But I don't want to be up on...  Online.  All right, Lydia.  All right.  When do you want to come in?  Yeah, come on in.  Pour it up a little.  I don't know.  I'll come in one day. 
[02:00:00]  You're not.  Yeah.  All right, Lydia.  She wants to get that on one side.  Take a picture from the neck down.  Yeah.  Do something like that.  Yeah.  Or invite a chimp over to rip your face off, and then send a picture.  Yeah, ask them to take a photo of it, or a videotape it.  She actually said my face is pretty good, too, though.  Oh, really?  That's hard to believe with this voice that we all get to hear.  This voice is horrific.  It's awful.  She's afraid of fat Lydia.com.  That's what the cunning linguist is saying.  Fattyrock.com is going to take over the world. 
[02:00:30]  Wait till you start seeing those Fattyrock pictures everywhere.  Oh, my God.  Is that Sally Struthers speaking of fat?  Oh, my God.  Oh, what happened to my little girl there?  Look at her.  She has been fat since the day the show was canceled.  Mm-hmm.  The day the show All in the Family was canceled, or they left the show earlier, as a matter of fact,  she started doing those commercials for the starving little kids, and blimped out, and  has never lost the weight. 
[02:01:00]  She just saw nothing beside all in the family.  No.  Because she got fat.  Which is so weird, because all she had to do was give those kids her lunch.  She would have been thinner, and the kids would have been happier.  She would have been fine.  They could have fed off her like little bed bugs.  Yes, they could.  Just biting into her.  She never lost it.  What a piggy.  All right, Lydia.  What is that?  She's like that other one.  Who is that?  Charlene Tilton?  Yeah.  What was that her name?  From Dallas.  Oh, right.  You're the same person, it seems.  She was always jammed into jeans right on the upper end of looking hot. 
[02:01:30]  She was a fidget, but she had really big cans and everything, and a nice figure.  Mm-hmm.  And then when that show ended, balloon.  She said, ah, screw it.  She blimped up.  Lydia, why are you still on the phone?  I don't know.  We're talking about old shows just to forget about you, and you're still sitting there  hoping that we're going to get back to you.  She's getting more fuel for more dreams, more stupid dreams of advice. 
[02:02:00]  Your dreams.  What's wrong with you and your dreams?  You therapists don't know how to live.  Everything has to be calculated when you analyze yourselves too much where you can't  have any fun.  Everything has to mean something, so that prevents you from really having fun in your  own dreams.  Be a slut.  What do you want to do in your dreams for real, Lydia?  Dream slut.  Be a dream slut.  In my dreams where I'm slut, I have different starring leading men.  I'm sorry, guys.  You what? 
[02:02:30]  I have different leading men.  Oh, different leading men.  We don't care.  I don't care who it is.  All right.  So we're too light colored for your dreams.  I understand.  I know you're obsessed with big black jeans, but.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Lydia.  She won't have sex with anyone who speaks the king's English.  Sometimes getting stuff out of the colors is just a, just a struggle.  It's an impossibility.  Lydia is a struggle.  She really is, huh? 
[02:03:00]  She cannot be any type of analyst or anything.  I'm not buying it.  No, she's perfect for that job.  That's the problem.  Yes.  That's the type of.  Yes.  They have to dissect everything, including their own lives.  She's always wrong, though.  I know.  Yeah.  All right.  She says I'm a crazy, paranoid, Nazi, you know, gun-loving lunatic.  Dude, I bet.  Yeah, that's crazy, right?  You're not any of those things.  No.  Of course not. 
[02:03:30]  Shut up.  I'm not.  Of course.  Who sent in this mall thing with the advertising?  Do you know anything about this, Danny?  Yeah, well, they're starting to, in some malls,  there's only a few of them around the country,  but they're starting to do these interactive advertising billboards  that could actually, like, read your face  and see if you're a man, a woman, what age you are,  and then project the appropriate ad for you watching this billboard.  Really? 
[02:04:00]  Fascinating, Captain.  Is it just naked men when Steve walks by?  Yeah.  I would imagine it would be.  Hey, why did they keep doing this?  Yes.  It goes to the mall in different disguises, but they get it right every time.  Every time.  I don't understand it.  It always shows them the ad for Lane Bryant.  Yes.  Lane Bryant clothing, and Iraq walks past just big food ads, pizza.  Yeah, that would suck.  Tell them where the food court is.  Right.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  It talks, flashes, colors, and must-shop sales across the screen,  all in an attempt to catch your eye.  They tend to look, you know, look at the screen,  and it's about 8 to 10 seconds.  But now in Chesterfield, the ads are looking right back at you.  The Chesterfield Mall is one of three in the country  testing out a new software from a company called True Media.  It works by putting a small camera inside the digital ad.  It has facial recognition, so it takes the middle part of your face  and kind of the bone structure, the eyes, nose, and mouth, that area. 
[02:05:00]  And it analyzes it, giving advertisers valuable information  about who's watching their ads.  The cameras will be able to tell how many people walk by the ads,  how many people stop to look,  and to some degree they may be able to determine the age,  sex, and ethnicity of the shopper.  Come on.  Well, they're running quickly with something on their shoulder.  You know, the odd thing is,  this is what this technology is being used for,  to help sell more tampons. 
[02:05:30]  It's like, are we that?  I understand advertising is important,  but do you have to let,  do you have to be that specific with who sees your product?  Yeah, if you just put on that spot an ad,  people are going to react to it.  You know what I mean?  The man walking,  but I asked a woman, change it!  Change it?  Just panicking.  Right.  God almighty.  We want to sell slinky.  Oh my God!  Quickly, quickly!  Switch walking, quickly!  That's how Madison Avenue thinks, too. 
[02:06:00]  Exactly like that.  I'm okay with the rotating ads.  You see a change every 30 seconds or whatever,  but you're right.  Being a panicky Pete with every single person that walks by.  Did they just stop it?  Right.  Oh, it's a sports car.  Yeah.  Oh, look, a nice sports car.  Ooh, I ran out of steam.  Oh, no, it's a comedian with nothing,  and then all of a sudden you see a bomb on the screen.  I was just trying to set you up.  Sports car, then you go into, like, teenage girl mode, 
[02:06:30]  pimple cream or something, you know.  Very quick, changing.  Right.  I kind of like the bit you started, that's all.  Here's part two of the story.  Steve walks by.  It's the opening of the executive production.  All of a sudden, a tumbleweed blows across the screen.  Yes.  Now, this track two here, keep in mind,  because this technology was featured in a very prominent Tom Cruise movie,  but hold your answers, folks.  Wait for the guy who runs the company to tell you what Tom Cruise movie it's like.  Oh, wow.  I can only imagine.  Jeez. 
[02:07:00]  True Media has already developed technology to use that information  to cater the ads to a specific shopper.  But the ad company, AdSpace, says that's not the goal.  It's just not practical for us to tailor it to a given person looking at the screen  because there are a lot of them,  and we wouldn't really be able to decide who to tailor it to.  Still, some shoppers say the technology is too 1984.  They don't want Big Brother knowing when and where they shop. 
[02:07:30]  Shut up.  There is no Big Brother.  Shut up.  Well, we've actually had people who talk about it being the movie Collateral  or Tom Cruise, you know, when he walked in the store  and they addressed him by name.  It's nowhere near that because what we are doing is anonymously.  This is only the beginning.  Plan on seeing these ads pop up at malls across the country.  Just another person getting something wrong ridiculously.  Yeah, what did he mean?  Collateral is that terrible J.B. Fox movie.  He meant Minority Report.  Yeah, Minority Report. 
[02:08:00]  Everyone knows.  But no, it was in Collateral.  Don't you remember when J.B. Fox walked by the futuristic billboard?  Collateral.  Collateral.  Collateral money.  Collateral damage.  But they're worried about wasting the eyes that might glance for a half a second.  You're not that important.  It's my thing.  That's what I just want to inform people of.  A lot of these people that are like, well, I'm afraid of the big brother thing,  and it's so, you're not that important.  The government could give a crap about your stupid life. 
[02:08:30]  Me, on the other hand, very, very important.  E-Rock walks by and all of a sudden the ad changes for Krill.  Krill joke.  Stupid Krill joke.  Dorsal fin cleaners.  Krill.  Yeah.  Baleen toothpaste.  It's an old whale joke.  Oh, Baleen floss.  That's very funny, Dusty.  Okay. 
[02:09:00]  Give me that one.  This is so unnecessary.  It is.  It's a cheap commercial, and a couple of girls were like,  but it's lipstick!  It's lipstick in immediately!  God, forget it.  You blew it.  You're fired.  God almighty.  What about when a soccer mom goes by, Jimmy?  Well, we got the lipstick on there now.  Yeah, the lipstick.  It's an older woman minivan!  Quick, pants that don't fit properly!  Hurry up, hurry up, you're fired!  You're fired.  All right, so now we got the minivan.  Yes.  The billboard is fired?  Yeah, the person operating the camera. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then you got the minivan, and now you got an old dude walking by.  Quick, something for undergarbage that don't allow you to leak out of them!  Quickly, your pants!  Your pants, oh my God!  Fix this technology, it's no good, he's gone!  I want to see a chimp-faced woman walk by there and see what pops up.  Quickly!  Shotguns with toe attachments!  Quick!  Cheese in a pizza oven!  Oh, wait, there's a person.  Ape repellent.  Do me a favor. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you.  Of course.  I might, okay.  I got to ring more.  Oh, boy.  I just thought of something.  Ape.  All right.  Ape repellent.  Yes, I was going to go with simple four words, letter words that started with W, though.  Ah, better.  I know, that's okay.  That's better.  Mine's four.  Mine's just two words.  Oh, Dusty got it.  Stump Brain, we got to go, but what's this funniest listener thing all about?  The search for the funniest listener. 
[02:10:30]  Where are we at?  That's for Friday.  We have about 25 candidates who've submitted a minute of their material, and we're going  to winnow it down to 10.  Okay.  You know what?  We're going to winnow it down.  What does that mean?  Wait, what?  Winnow.  Winnow?  Yes.  I thought you said whittle.  Whittle.  I hear whittle it down.  What does winnow mean?  Same thing.  We're going to thin the herd, break it down to filter it.  All I'm seeing is winnow with question marks.  No one seems to know.  Can you look up winnow?  Please, Danny.  Danny, sorry, Stump Brain, if you could hold on for a minute for your ridicule. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  We will be with you in a moment.  How smart do you have to be?  No one says winnow.  You don't need the word winnow in your vocabulary.  Is it there?  How would I go about spelling this word?  Yeah.  W-I-N-N-O-W.  That's what I would think of.  O-W?  Yeah.  Hey, maybe I made up a word.  Oh, boy.  Winnow.  To freeze from the lighter particles of chaff dirt.  Yeah, so to get rid of, to take the best out of the chaff. 
[02:11:30]  Yes, to take the best out.  To winnow it down.  Many people are saying you should be thrown out a winnow.  Exactly.  When you're on the air, the listener's Luzo.  Can you throw it down a little bit for everybody, please?  Okay, we're going to select ten.  Thank you.  That's what we want to hear.  That's what we want to hear.  Friday night, and you guys are going to judge.  Voss is going to host, and he'll do a little comedy.  Yeah, we're all going to hang out at comics this Friday night.

Ooh.  For a winnow down from a 56-inch.  That's right.  Winnow.  That's all I want to say now is that word.  Too late to get your entries in?

I don't know  Wow, we haven't talked about that in a couple years  It just went to the wayside, didn't it?  Probably when they redid the studio  They just threw it out  Going, ah, they don't need this anymore  I'd love to know who's buying this, though  The commercial's great  Because it's one of those classic, cheesy, infomercial-style commercials  And they show this guy  And he's listening to this CD with headphones on  And he's getting all pumped up about himself  He's so excited about  It's so ridiculous 
[02:20:00]  Like, no one's sitting at home listening to this  You think they're all pumped up  You think they got the Rocky theme song to really pump you up?  Are these people looking?  He's a lunatic  He's being inspired to shoot up his school  Is what he looks like  Cheers to you  Cheers to you  Wow  By the way, we're buying this immediately  I hope  Well, of course  As a show, if we don't buy cheers to you  Cheers to you  We gotta hear what cheers to you is all about  If the good cheer  If the puzzle is incomplete without me  What?  Normally, $35, only $24.95 
[02:20:30]  That's a steal  That really is  Look at this guy  Yes!  Yes!  Look, I could do it, man!  Look at that awful shirt  When was this possible?  This is new  I just  The one of the guys wearing one of my old sweaters  That's what they do  I don't know why infomercials have to look like  They have all that look to them  I don't know why they do that  One of the worst infomercials that are on now  Is for that make your PC run faster thing, you know?  Oh, yeah  And  Finally fast, right?  Yeah  And the kid that's playing the video game 
[02:21:00]  Is like  Mom!  Our internet connection is so slow  Our computer is so slow  I can't play this game  And the game he's playing  It's like Wolfenstein  Dude, it's  Wolfenstein  It's something from an 80's arcade game  It's playing Tempest  And it's not  And it's not working on his slow computer  And then it says  For PC only  Does not work on Mac  And every instance you see  Someone's on a Mac  Saying that  They must have just had that around the office 
[02:21:30]  Right  When they were filming it  Is this the guy right here?  It's clearly a Mac  Yeah, yeah  It's like  No, it's the angry  Little fucking snotty kid  It's not loading  Let me try this again  He starts crying  Yeah, here it is  Look at that game  This game should be a lot  A lot faster  Mom!  This internet connection is so slow  I love my computer  Mom!  I don't know what happens  He's playing some game  It's just not as fast  You see this guy downloading  And you see like  A child's shoe  And a child's leg  And the guy's trying to jerk off  This is too slow  He's very angry 
[02:22:00]  He does look like a pedo  This guy  Wait, so this is a newer  This is another  Oh yeah  Oh yeah, dude  Just came out  A couple months, maybe  And did you see the game?  Probably, because they couldn't get the rights  For any real games  So that's why  But still  It makes the commercial look dated  It's so bad  It's almost like Space Invaders  Look at this game  Oh my god  He's playing that?  Yes  It looks like  It literally looks worse  Than in the arcades  Everybody knows the game  1942  Yes  It was like the top down  Airplane World War II battle  It's worse than that arcade game 
[02:22:30]  You're a plane at the bottom of the screen  And then planes are coming at you  From the top of the screen down  It's two dimensional  If this game is running slow  On your computer  It's time to get a 486  Yeah, yeah  Upgrade to a 486  You have an Etch-A-Sketch  If this is running slow on it  What a piece of shit  Plane game that is  And he yells  Mom!  Can we hear him again, please?  He's that guy  I'm not doing this now  What are they trying to sell in this commercial?  Faster internet?  Probably acting lessons 
[02:23:00]  No, you know what it is  It's actually  They want you to  I think grant your computer access to their website  And then their website makes tweaks to your computer  So basically  You're paying for like  Just a  Simple registry edits  And stuff that you could do  At yourself at home  If you just took the 10 minutes  To research how to make your computer faster  Some guy at some remote location  Can fuck with your computer  And guarantee  They put all kinds of spyware on there  And other shit  Probably  But uh  Yeah  I think I have it queued up to where the kid goes  Mom  Yeah  He rules 
[02:23:30]  This game should be a lot  A lot faster  Mom  This internet connection is so slow  I love  They pan to an open closet door  And his mother's sitting there with her throat slit  He's like yelling at the torso  And her body  This internet connection is so slow  And her pantyhose around her ankles  With a plunger sticking out of her pussy  Angry plane game boy  Holy shit  The computer's not even plugged in  Just him with a fucking 
[02:24:00]  A fake continental plane making zoom sounds  Fucking asshole  Something that's been bothering me lately too  Is like there's a new Stacker 2 commercial  For 6 Hour Power  And it's like a regular commercial  For one of those like you know  Energy shot drinks or whatever  But the very very end  They tag this commercial with this guy  He's obviously some kind of body building  Like you know  Super guido looking guy right  Yeah  And he holds the shot  And he's like  He looks like he should be on Wall Street  And he's got like the shirt and the tie  And he holds it and he goes  Now I'm ready 
[02:24:30]  And it's so terrible and awful  And it makes me laugh hysterically  Every time I watch it  Because nothing is that bad  Is this product called Finally Fast?  Yeah  Finally Fast  Oh Sonny  Sonny Ferrelli everyone  Sonny  Hey  Hey Sonny  You know that commercial  Finally Fast commercial  It's actually for Acentive Software  And I got hooked into it  They actually  You know  They actually have you do a scan on your computer  And then they want you to buy their software  To fix the problems that they found  And um  I don't know 
[02:25:00]  I bought into it  I sucked into it  It kind of worked a little bit  But then they wanted me to buy  Four more other software programs  For this that  And the other crappy shit  That's the whole  That's the whole thing with any infomercial  Whatever they're selling  They just want to get you on the phone  And then you realize  If you buy one thing  You're obligated to at least be shipped other stuff  That you will then have to ship back  And pay shipping to them  This inflated shipping price 
[02:25:30]  And that's how they get you  Like there's that guy that goes  Buy my product  You know the guy that has the  The selling fucking  How to work a computer  Ebay  For fucking assholes  Things like that  Yeah well  He gets on there  What you do is  They'll keep sending you shit  And you have to keep sending it back  And there's no way to fucking stop them  From sending you this shit  Well the worst part about this  Is that when I downloaded that program  Right  They downloaded a whole bunch of spyware  On my computer 
[02:26:00]  And I can't get the fucking shit off now  Yeah that's usually what these things are  Big fucking spyware dump  It's a big spyware dump  Yeah  You deserve it though  For not doing the research yourself  It would have taken you 15 minutes  To figure out how to tweak your operating system  I think I fucking snuddy  It would have been fucking better on my computer  If you go to  If you put a lot of these products  That are online 
[02:26:30]  Or on TV for infomercials  Into Google  You will come up with so many fucking complaints  About how they're run  How shitty their customer service is  And one of those is that CD guy  Buy my product  There are so many complaints  For that fucking company  Because they'll send you  They go  We'll send you free CDs  You just pay shipping  So they send you these free things  And they're like half the program 
[02:27:00]  So then you have to get the other half  By buying it  And then in order to send the shit back  You've got to pay shipping  Which is $7.95 a disc  Or something crazy like that  They really get you  And then they keep sending you discs  Fucking scam  And then you've got to send them back  At your expense  The world is fair with scammers  It's the video professor  They got me  Video professor  Oh video professor  I couldn't think of the guy's name  Yeah  Video professor  Okay  Do you remember the  Fucking Columbia house  Oh yeah  Sure 
[02:27:30]  I belong to them  With the DVDs  And I got so many weird ones  Wild West by Will Smith  Which I didn't want  Everyone signed up for that  Like you send a penny  And you taped a penny  Onto a little card  And you mailed it  And got your choice of like  15 CDs  I know someone that used  Their neighbor's address  And would make sure they  You know  Got there before that  Neighbor got home  Oh you know someone  That did that  Is that someone  A blonde haired man 
[02:28:00]  In this room  No  I wouldn't do anything  As illegal as that  Something is illegal  But I know of somebody  I think the statutes up on that  Yes  Tell you the truth  It's a pretty smart scam  Yeah  Because then this person  Never had to really  Buy the CDs ever  Well of course  CDs  What are we talking about  Cassettes  Albums  It was cassettes  And then 8-tracks  Yeah  CDs  Albums  And then the 8-track  Always cost a little more  The cassette cost a little more  Right  Yeah  Wasn't that it  It's a big album  How do you ship those things 
[02:28:30]  You used to go in a huge box  To get 15 albums for a penny  And this giant box  Would show all the albums  You know what  People always complain about  Those Columbia House things  Because you'd have to send them back  But if you just did  What the commitment was  It was actually  Way ahead of the game  Yeah  I know  It really wasn't a bad deal at all  But this person only had a paper out  So you know  Saving for savings  Russelline  Yeah  If you can pause that  Finally Fast commercial  On the screen with the word pad 
[02:29:00]  There's like four storybook stories on there  That are just so jacked up and twisted  Really?  Yeah  If you can pause on there  It's like what  I hope that no one's really reading this to their kids  Really?  Fascinating  You know where she's talking  Yeah they talk about SARS  And stuff like that  The hunchback had a tumor  And stuff like that  Who knew?  We're trying to find it  Yeah we're trying to find it  I want to play that plane game  That looks fun  Doesn't that look like so much fun 
[02:29:30]  Yeah you're flying  And like  Colostomy bags are coming at you  Alright thank you  It's called the shit windshield  That's the name of the fucking game  Boy I couldn't get shit windshield to work  Speaking of these infomercials  The paper  And it was like on page two today  They're having these Snuggies bar crawls  They're taking over the world  Yeah  The Snuggie is the fad of this Christmas  Well it's the take off on the old toga party  But instead of having togas  It's people who are wearing Snuggies  And going out to bars 
[02:30:00]  And they're Snuggies  Looking like a dude  It's not funny  They're going to get drunk all over their feet  You know what would be a great thing  Once someone like the piece of someone's Snuggie  Gets caught in someone's car door  And they're dragged to death  Because they can't get out of their Snuggie  And their fucking skin is scraped off their genitals  There's like a pile of dickless meat in a Snuggie  Then no one will do Snuggie parties anymore  Snuggie  Or until a gang of Snuggie wearing rapists attack a woman  They all had a lot of Snuggies  And they raped me  They shoved a real Afghan in my mouth 
[02:30:30]  So I couldn't yell help and ouch  Stupid Snuggies and their dumb parties  How bad do you need to interact with humans?  Did anyone ever pay for the Columbia House things?  Because it was just  It was one of those things that you just didn't  Well  You never fulfilled your commitment  And a lot of times there was the thing of  Well  I'm not even 18  So you gotta be 18 to sign a contract  And they can't come after me  I know a person 
[02:31:00]  And meanwhile it's like  They could totally come after your parents  Yeah  It's your parents mailing address  Doesn't matter whose fucking name is on it  Do you know  I know a guy  No you used the neighbor's address  This person was brilliant with this idea  I know a guy that got arrested  And actually spent a night in jail  For a Columbia House record scheme  Shut the fuck up  You're so full of shit  I'm not  And he's smiling ear to ear  Going  No nods  This is  Name Ted  No  No  No  Oh

We need to know  Yeah we need to know  I need to know  Donna wants to know  He got locked up  Yeah  For the Columbia House thing  Why?  Do you want to say his name?  Yeah it was  Fraud or something  Fraud?  Yeah  I would think that would be a civil matter  Yeah  Not a criminal matter  But  So what happens  Sometimes you  You think you may have something

[02:41:30]  Which one though  Because there's like  85 different products  That use that same tag  Yeah the rotisserie one  But what's kind of funny  Is when you get it  You open up the instructions  And it's like  Thank you for buying  The rompo peel  Set it and forget it  Thing  And then it says  Like right underneath  Please note that  You cannot set it and forget this  You must constantly watch this product  To avoid fire  You can't set it and forget it  But the whole name is  Set it and forget it  It's a complete fucking farce  No the funny thing is  It was set it and forget it  And it was an ad for like  Baby clothes in a crib  So you put the kid in the crib  And you just walk away  A little picture of a kid with Sid

[02:53:30]  For this  Bob Gale  What  Who is Bob Gale  By the way  Who is Bob Gale  Bob co-wrote  Back to the Future  A little film you might  Have heard of  With Robert Zemeckis  And wrote  Back to the Future  2 and 3  He also co-produced  On all three films  Uh  I want to actually know  Exactly what his input was  He also wrote  Please more importantly  Not  Used cars  Did he really  One of the funniest films ever  Ever  Yes  Jimmy is constantly 
[02:54:00]  Talking about used cars  It's very funny  And  I want to hold your hand  Hmm  Wasn't that um  That Beatles movie  With Spielberg made  I'm not sure  We'll have to ask him  He's on the phone  Why don't we talk to him  Hey Bob  Welcome to the  O.P. and Anthony show  Hey thanks guys  You got uh  Three or four guys here  That are obsessed  With the Back to the Future series  Great  Thanks  No joke  There's an obsession  That is a little creepy  Bob uh  What what  I gotta ask you first 
[02:54:30]  What the hell is it about  Back to the Future  That uh  This many years later  People still  Uh  Are buying it on DVD  Find it fascinating  Entertaining  I think that the core  Idea of it  Is just something  That strikes everybody  I mean what's amazing  To me is how  All these kids today  Little kids  I mean my daughter  Wasn't born when the movie  Was made  She and all her friends  In college  They've seen it  Neither was my girlfriend  You know it's  It's  It's just a universal  Thing that 
[02:55:00]  Everybody  Comes to the realization  Oh my god  At one time  My parents  Were children  They were kids  Same age as me  Right  And that's just  A fascinating idea  And  You know  They  Nobody really  Really explored that idea  To the degree  That we did  Before our movie  Did you come up with  The basic  The actual idea  Of this guy  Going back in time  Yeah  And it  Kind of screwing up 
[02:55:30]  Well  The way it started  Zemeck and I  Always talked about  Trying to figure out  How to do a time travel movie  Because  We  We both  Had our minds  Warped  Watching the  Twilight Zone  And the  George Powell  Time machine movie  But we never  Were able to figure out  The hook  And then  I was actually  Back  Visiting my parents  In St. Louis  On a promotional trip  For used cars  And  Digging through my  My basement  I found my father's 
[02:56:00]  High school yearbook  And  I was thumbing through it  And there was my father  And he was the president  Of his graduating class  And I started thinking  About the president  Of my graduating class  Who was  You know  One of these  Kind of  Rah rah  Asshole guys  And I'm thinking  My god  If I had gone to  High school  With my dad  Would I have been  Friends with them  Or would I have  Had nothing to do  With them  So that  That was the  Germ of the idea  To make a time travel  Story that was  A little different  Than anything else  What if you could 
[02:56:30]  Go to high school  With your parents  So when I got back  To California  I started talking  To Zemeckis  About this  And he got  Excited about it  And he said  Yeah what if it  Turned out that  Your mom was  The slut  And  You know  And then it just  The snowball  Got rolling  And we pitched it  Over at Columbia  Because they  Really liked used cars  Even though the movie  Hadn't done much  At the box office  They said  You want to do  Your next movie  And we set it up there  And in true 
[02:57:00]  Hollywood fashion  After we wrote  Two drafts of the script  They said  Well no  We don't want to make it  And it took us  Almost four years  After that  To finally get the movie  In the production  Bob is it true  That Disney  Wouldn't take the movie  Because it was too  The subject matter  Was a little too risqué  For even Disney  Yeah actually  That's absolutely true  We  We shot the movie around  And at the time  Launch  The early 80's  Launch comedy  Was the big thing  They wanted  You know  Stripes 
[02:57:30]  Stuff  Stuff that was  More gross  And they kept  Well back  It's a really nice script  It's really sweet  It's got this  Family thing going on  You guys ought to  Take this to Disney  Yeah right  And we kept hearing  This over and over again  And finally  We'd been rejected  By every studio  And we said  Well what the hell  Let's go take it to Disney  See what they say  So we  We have a meeting  Over there  And this was  Way before  Disney got  Itself revamped  So this was the  Old  The old  Disney management  That was making 
[02:58:00]  Such great movies  As Tron  And the Black Hole  So we go in there  And the guy said  Are you guys nuts  We can't make  This movie here  This scene  With the kid  And his mother  In the car  And there's an  Attempted rape  What are you thinking  Yeah  That  We always  We always  Do talk  A lot about  The content  Of it  And the fact  That it is  A comedy  It's  It's considered 
[02:58:30]  By a lot  Of people  On the outside  As a very  Innocent movie  But some of the  Scenes in there  And some of the  Language  You could not  Put in a movie  Today  That is marketed  To the same  People it was  Marketed to  Back when this  Came out  Well PG-13  Didn't exist  Back then  So we have  A PG rating  And yeah  We have  Shits  And goddams  And that  Sort of stuff  Which  You know  We just  It was in there  Because that's  The way kids  Talk  Yeah  They talk that way 
[02:59:00]  Then and  They still talk  That way  Worse probably  But I mean  I can remember  Being a kid  And they would  Show back to the  Future  For  You know  We have like  Movie day  Or whatever  It was like  In the auditorium  And I remember  Being uncomfortable  As a kid  Like watching  You know  Biff try to  Get it on  With Lorraine  In the car  And I'm like  I don't think  This is  I'm in third grade  I'm not supposed  To be watching this  This is a little  Inappropriate  For me  This is dirty  And obviously  It totally destroyed  Your  All your thought  Processes 
[02:59:30]  Didn't it  It is one of my  Favorite movies  Of all time  I just  It's just so strange  How you would  Never even  I don't think  That kind of  Sub  If that movie  Was re-released  In the theater  Now  I mean  It would probably  Get an R rating  Yeah  Well no  I don't think  It would get  An R rating  But it would  Certainly get  A PG-13  Yeah  They'd have  One of those  Disclaimers  For mild language  And strong  Sexual content  And almost a  Rape  And by the way  Yeah  I always wondered  Why George  Would have  Biff come over  And be his  Car wax guy  When he tried 
[03:00:00]  To rape his wife  Well it just  Shows what a  Decent forgiving  Guy  There you go  I was wondering  About that  Something came  For you Mr.  McFly  I think it's  Your new book  Remember when I  Tried to  Reap your girlfriend  Yeah  Not to mention  The incest  Yeah they are  The whole incestuous  Angle  They are kissing  They are mother  And son  Even though  They're the same  Age at the time  Any flack from that 
[03:00:30]  As far as  When you went  Before the ratings board  No  No none at all  No they were fine  He was the only  One that really  Got upset  But we dealt  With it  With a comedic  Touch  So that  You just knew  This was not  Serious  And it was just  Never going to  Really  Nothing was going to  Actually really  Happen in there  That was  We were writing  The script  It was one of the  Things that  We kept saying  Well how are we  Going to get out  Of this  Yeah 
[03:01:00]  How are we  Going to get out  Of this  And we came up  With the idea  Well okay  It's like kissing  My brother  You know  Lorraine has that line  Right right  And we said  Well okay  We can do that  Because this situation  Has never actually  Ever happened before  Yes  Who knows what it  Would be like  It might seem like  That  I know you probably  Get asked this a lot  But I mean  I'm sure I know  All the hardcore fans  Know out there  That Back to the Future  Originally was cast  With Eric Stoltz  As Marty McFly  That's correct  And everybody wants  To know when  This footage  Because it's nowhere  It's one of the only 
[03:01:30]  Things that you  Just cannot find  I mean most  Look we  We did not  Destroy the footage  The footage exists  And we thought  Back in 2002  When the movie  First came out  In DVD  Zemeck and I  Had a long conversation  About whether or not  We should put  Any of this  Stuff on there  And we decided  Not to  Because  At this time  Because  Eric's still  A working actor  He didn't do 
[03:02:00]  Anything wrong  It was our mistake  We miscast it  What was the mistake  Like what did you  See in him  That made you say  Like oh boy  This ain't the right guy  Was it the  Rocky Dennis  Makeup and mask  And he was just  Running around  Like  You know  Retard going back  Back to the future  And he's so stupid  Jesus Christ  That would have been  That would have been  What we  Would do in  Back to the future  Too  When Biff  Messed everything  Yeah that's a  Different timeline  Eric was a good actor 
[03:02:30]  And the studio  The head of the studio  Was just  So extremely  Bullish on him  Because he loved  The movie Mask  That  I mean he  You know  He really was  Kind of an overbearing  Guy  And it was  He said to us  In a moment  Of bravura  He just said  I'm so convinced  That Eric Stoltz  Will be great  In this movie  That if he's not  You guys recast  And start all over  Now he never  Expected we would  Take him up on that 
[03:03:00]  Because he thought  Eric Stoltz  Would just be  Great  And he wasn't  So after five weeks  Bob had put enough  Footage together  Where he realized  That it wasn't  Working the way  It was supposed to work  And he had  Neil Canton  My co-producer  And I  Look at the footage  Because I never  Would look at  Cut footage  Until there was  An entire cut  Of the movie  So I knew  There was a problem  If Bob was asking  Me to come  In the cutting room  Oh boy 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  In the screening room  And then  We all  We all said  Oh shit  We had  Spielberg  And Kathy  Kenny  Frank Marshall  Our executive  Producers  Look at it  And they said  Oh shit  And we decided  And Stephen  In his infinite wisdom  Said look  You can't go  Tell Sheinberg  That you've made  A mistake here  Without having a way  To solve the mistake 
[03:04:00]  I mean  Was Eric  Was he acting clowny  Or was he not  Acting clowny enough  Eric is  He's  He's  You know  Sort of the method  School of acting  So he went  Into the future  To prepare for his role  Well he had to wear  The wardrobe home  He just didn't have  The sense of comedy  That the character  Needed  Right  I mean I know  It's been asked  A thousand times  But I mean  Will that footage  Ever come out  And be available  To the public  Maybe on a future  Blu-ray release  Well I don't know 
[03:04:30]  I don't know  If we'll  I don't know  It'll be later  Rather than sooner  Because to say  We don't want  The footage  To embarrass Eric  That could huh  Well  People are going to talk  Yeah  Some people say  Well it wasn't that bad  And some people say  Oh my god  How stupid were those idiots  For putting that guy  In the movie  But  I say  Anything that's going to  Make somebody else  Look bad  Is hysterical  You know  When  When  When 
[03:05:00]  When we're all  You know  In our 60s or 70s  Then maybe  We'll say  Okay yeah  Now  It's so far  You know  Oh just put it on  YouTube already  Just throw it up there  You guys kind of  Got stuck in a  Little bit of a problem  With the end of  Back to the Future 1  Everybody knows  The whole thing  With the you know  Marty it's your kids  Almost everybody  And you had to  Resolve that  Had you wished  You known  Beforehand  That you  Would have had a sequel 
[03:05:30]  And didn't end it  That way  Well  The thing is  If we knew  We were going to do  A sequel  We would have never  Had Jennifer get in the car  Right  Because that  That was the  That was the big  That was the big problem  Right  What are we going to do  With Jennifer  I mean she's  It should have just  Stopped where  He went like  Hey let's drop  This bitch off  Marty  And then they just  Land back  Drop her off  In the house  And take off again  Or maybe after  They take  That's basically what we do  We had to be unconscious  For the whole sequel  Yeah she was completely 
[03:06:00]  Unconscious for the whole movie  Did you think it was really weird though  Like having Jack Warden  Play two roles  Hey you're talking about  Used cars now Jimmy  I'm talking about  We're talking about  Back to the movie actually  What's that?  Used cars  The reason that we got  Jack Warden  When we wrote the script  We didn't think of  Think of those brothers  As being played  By the same actor  And actually at one point  Kevin Conway was going to  Was going to play  Roy Fuchs  And then he  He decided not to 
[03:06:30]  So we went after  Jack Warden  And Warden passed on it  And then I forget  Who it was  That said  You know there's three things  That there's three things  That an actor likes to do  They like to play  They like to  Act drunk  They like to play dead  And they like to play  More than one role  In the same movie  And in used cars  If you make them  If you make the  Two brothers  Be played by the same guy  He'll get to do  He'll get to play dead 
[03:07:00]  And play two parts  And it's interesting  That you use that same tactic  In the Back to the Future series  When Michael J. Fox  Is playing  Obviously his entire  Well most of his  Immediate family  Yes  Well look  That was just a slam dunk  Obvious thing to do  You gotta do that  I did have a little bit  Of an issue with three though  Being that his forefathers  And mother  Looked the same  Now that would be  A coincidence  Because their children  Would have had to  Been married off  To another family 
[03:07:30]  So why would his wife  Look just like  Now okay  There's an answer  To that one  Alright  Because we thought  About that  I mean  The practical answer  Was  Leah Thompson  One of the greatest  People in the world  To work with  And Bob and I  Said we can't  Make another  Back to the Future  Movie without  Putting Leah in it  So that was  Number one  We just liked  Working with her  She's just  A pleasure to work with  And then we said  Okay well  It's always said  That men are  Attracted to women  That remind them  Of their mothers 
[03:08:00]  Wow  Throughout the generations  Yes  There you go  Alright  Well whatever works  So you're basically  Saying that she was  Available and Frank  McCray couldn't do it  Because he was doing  A project after  Used cars  Now Frank McCray  Project the interview  One of the funniest  Guys ever  Frank the big black  Guy in 48 hours  He was the  Eddie Murphy's  Boss the cop  And that's  Whatever happened  To Frank McCray  Do you know  Boy I've lost 
[03:08:30]  Touch with Frank  I don't know  What happened to Frank  You see  You know  Fairly regularly  But I don't know  About 10 or 15 years ago  I kind of  I have no idea  He's showing a little  Old guy the car  He's like  It's all big and comfy  And roomy  And you gotta look  And the guy's like  I don't want to look inside  He's like oh  Just look inside  The guy's like  I don't want to look inside  So he grabs the little  Old man and just  Shoves him in the car  Oh get in the  Motherfucking car  It's fucking hilarious  Just get in the  Motherfucking car  Cause he's a mechanic 
[03:09:00]  He's had a car salesman  Oh just get in the  Motherfucking car  That was funny  The greatest thing  That Frank had lived  In Back to the Future  Cause that thing  Was scripted  Cause it was a  Pay off  The set up to the gag  Was Kurt Russell  Saying no matter  What you do  Make sure you get  The customer in the car  Nothing sells the car  Better than the car itself  Get the customer in the car  So Frank was gonna  Get this guy in the car  Speaking of cars  How did you decide  On the DeLorean  For Back to the Future  As the time vehicle  Very good Danny 
[03:09:30]  That was just  Oh man  Zemeckis came up  With that  He said what if we  What if we  What if we use a DeLorean  The original  If you guys are  Total Back to the Future  You know  It was a refrigerator  Hello  It was a time chamber  That was like  An old refrigerator  That's just silly  And then  Yeah it was  It had to be  Carted around  On the back of a truck  Yeah and didn't  Didn't the original  Script call for  The refrigerator  Time device  To be kind of  Dragged by  A nuclear test facility 
[03:10:00]  And that's how  That's what the reaction  Was to  Initiate time travel  That's crazy  Well Spielberg  Ripped it off  In Indiana Jones 4  Oh right  Yeah yeah  That whole thing  At the beginning  Where Harrison Ford  Is running around  In the fake town  And that was all  In the script  Of Back to the Future  And he goes  In the refrigerator  And lives  Through a nuclear explosion  By being in a refrigerator  Yeah  Spielberg ripped us off  Motherfucker  Damn him  So basically  Because the weird  Things that translate  Like we're all  Laverne and Shirley fans 
[03:10:30]  And when you decided  To put Lenny and  Squiggy in used cars  As the cameraman  How great  My favorite line  Is probably  When they're filming  The hijacked commercial  And that woman  By the way  Whose shirt gets  Ripped off  And her tits pop out  Is that Betty Thomas  From Hill Street Blues  No no  The girl in the commercial  Was Cheryl Rickson  She was the penthouse  Pen of the year  Oh okay  Because someone  Betty Thomas  Is one of the girls  There's the  Strip promotion 
[03:11:00]  Where six girls  Are taking off  Their clothes  On half of the cars  And one of them  Is Betty Thomas  Oh that's okay  I mix you up the scenes  But one of my favorite  Things when that girl  Is getting her shirt  Ripped off  Like the hood pops up  And her shirt gets  Ripped off  And they're on live TV  And he goes  And like  I think it's  Squeaky  He goes  Oh Jesus  She's caught on the hood  And he goes  Oh don't you hate women  That's why  No no no  He says  All those years  Of film school  Paid off  When does he  When does he say  Oh don't you hate women  He doesn't say that  What are you talking about 
[03:11:30]  Jimmy  Please don't tell me  He doesn't say that  You're ruining everything  Jimmy  I want to talk about  I think he's  A young actor  Called Crispin Glover  I think you're on that  Bob  What happened now  They're putting that  Letterman stuff back on  After Joaquin Phoenix's  Yeah yeah I know  His weird appearance  On that show  Oh man  But he didn't want to do  The second one I guess  Huh  No no  Crispin  There's some actors  That think that  That you know 
[03:12:00]  Popcorn movies  Are just  They're just  Awful things  They're true  Artistes  You know  And Crispin  Was in that mode  And he  I don't even remember him  Whether he even  Saw the movie  Really  Finally finished  He certainly didn't  Show up at the  Cats and Crew screening  And he actually  He sued  Didn't he  The production company  Or the movie company  Yeah he sued  We  You know  We offered him  Before we even 
[03:12:30]  Wrote the sequel  Bob and I said  Okay look  Before we can even  Agree to a sequel  We need to know  That we got  Michael J. Fox  And Christopher Lloyd  To come back  So we  We called those guys up  And we said  If we do a sequel  Will you guys be in  I said absolutely  You guys are doing it  We're in  So we made the deals  With those guys first  Then Bob and I said  Okay well let's see  How much  How many other members  Of the cast  Will want to come back  For another one  So Leah Thompson  Said I'm in  And Tom Wilson  Played Biff 
[03:13:00]  Said I'm in  And Crispin  Said well  And his agent  Called and said  Well Crispin wants  Michael J. Fox's deal  Which was  Two million dollars  And he wants  Script approval  And I said  To the agent  Look I said  Come on  I'm not even gonna  I'm not even gonna  Dignify that  With a response  It's crazy  You know  Michael J. Fox  On the number one  Television show  In America  Of course he's gonna  Get two million dollars  For this 
[03:13:30]  How much were they  Offering Crispin Glover  How much less  Oh  The final offer  That we made  To Crispin  First of all  Crispin wouldn't even  He wouldn't even  Budge off of that  So we said  Okay well shit  I said  I said to the agent  I want you to tell  I want you to tell  Your client two words  Richard Castellano  You know who  Richard Castellano is  No  Oh come on  Guys  Exactly  Like Clemenza  In The Godfather  Exactly  Okay  Right  So he  He was a stickler 
[03:14:00]  About  About  Wanting too much money  For Godfather Part 2  So Francis killed him  Right  Yep  Clemenza's dead  He's a black armband  In The Godfather 2  So  We said  I said to the agent  Look  We can always  Have Crispin be dead  In the future  There's no  You know  George McFly could be dead  Tell your client  That if  If you don't want to  If you guys don't want to  And the agent knew  That this was insane  What Crispin was asking for  But  Two weeks later  The agent called me back 
[03:14:30]  And she said  No  Sorry  He won't budge  I said okay  And so  Bob and I  Said okay  We've got  We've got Leah  We've got  We've got Biff  We've got Lorraine  We don't have George  So let's make George  Into a tombstone  So the whole idea  Of the alternate  1985  Where  Where Lorraine  Had married Biff  Came about  Because  Crispin didn't want  To be in the movie  Wow damn  Yeah  It works  About two months  Before the movie  Was going to start shooting 
[03:15:00]  Crispin's agent called  And said well  Crispin thinks  Maybe he made a mistake  Oops  I said okay  Well we're happy  To put him in the movie  But it's not going to be  A very big role  And the whole idea  By the way  Of having  You know  In the future  You see George McFly  Floating around  Upside down  Yeah  Because he threw out his back  Well  We thought to ourselves  Okay  If we have  We didn't want to  Really have George  Dead in the  In the more  Positive future  Because that would  Be kind of sad  Let's hold 
[03:15:30]  Let's put the guy  Upside down  So if we have  To recast him  It'll be hard  To recognize  Whether it's really  He's in front of his face  And if Crispin  Really does it  Then we can  Hang him upside down  Like the dentist  From Ed Wood  Yeah  Just put you  Came over your face  Eyebrows up  He looks just like him  I think  I think by the way  That you're wrong  About that line Bob  I hate to correct  The guy that wrote it  But I do think  That he says  Oh Jesus  He's caught on the hood  Ornament  Oh don't you hate women  Oh yeah  Okay okay  You're right  There you go 
[03:16:00]  There you go  I haven't seen it in a while  Okay  Stand corrected  Why would you know  Don't argue with the geeks  I know  Has there ever been  Have you ever been  Approached to remake  Back to the Future  Because so much  Are you asking me or him  No not you Jimmy  Because so much stuff  Is being remade now  From the 80s  Has anybody ever  Like brought that up  To you Hollywood  No  And you know what  Because I think  We've said so many times  Look Indiana Jones  Part 4  Is the perfect reason  Why we don't go back 
[03:16:30]  To that  Back to the Future  Not even like  Back to the Future 4  Just like remaking it  With different cast  Well  All that we can do  If we did that  Is fail  Oh I agree  I was just wondering  If it's ever been presented  So you know  Nobody's talked to  Nobody's said  Well we're going to  Remake this  With you guys  Or without  Well then we'd say  You know  You're crazy  But go ahead  All anybody's going to say  Is boy  They fucked it up  The magazine  We're really geniuses  And they fucked it up 
[03:17:00]  They're remaking this  If you were going to  If you were to do  A remake of  Back to the Future  Would you give Marty  More than 10 minutes  To save Doc's life  At the end  When he's getting  Shot up by Libyan terrorists  I always thought  That was a  It was a strange  Judgment call  On Marty's part  Thinking that  Like 10 minutes  Would be perfect  To go and save  A unarmed  Marty McFly  By the way  Was going to  Take care of  Three Libyan terrorists  One has a  RPG  Rocket launcher  But Marty decides  10 minutes is perfect  I'm going to take care 
[03:17:30]  Of this in 10 minutes  Why not more time  For Marty  Well  You guys  You guys remember  What it was like  When you were in high school  I mean  You know  He's a 17 year old kid  He's stupid  I can take out some  He's just stupid  I have a  Back to the Future  Question  Oh do you  Okay  Jimmy's got one  Yes  Would you  When putting  Michael J. Fox  In the back  Of a convertible  Teach him to hide better  That is funny  He's just yapping  On that walkie talkie  But Biff 
[03:18:00]  Is such an idiot  That you know  He might not notice that  He's very self centered  Yeah  Would you change  The name of it  So the porno  Couldn't be called  Black to the Future  Which it was  There was a porno  Made called  Backsides to the Future  What do you think  About all these  T-shirt companies  That are trying to  Cash in on  Like the 80's nostalgia  And you know  They're putting out  Back to the Future  T-shirts  And I'm sure  You know  Danny wears them  I am guilty  I'm guilty  Travis is guilty  We're all guilty  Well if it's 
[03:18:30]  Licensed material  I'm all for it  Yeah  But what if  Maybe it's not though  Well you know what  That's up to the  Legal Department  And Universal  To go after that  Speaking of Universal  Were you attached  To any of those sets  That caught fire  On the Back to the Future  Set  I know that was big news  And it was a  Terrible terrible loss  For all of us here  Well look  I was asked that  At the time  You know  Aren't you upset  About this  And I said  Well come on  It's a set  You know  Sets are not  Built to be permanent  They're built to be  Taken down 
[03:19:00]  And they've rebuilt it  It's all pretty much  The way it was  What I was more worried  About was  Was the film vaults  Where they had  All the masters  And stuff  That's the stuff  That would be hard  To replace  The studios  Are all burning down  All the time  Well I know  For a long time  They stored the film  The film vaults  Were made of straw  Have they stopped  Doing that  Yeah I think  That the second  Little  They moved it  Into the second  Little pig's house  Are there any plans 
[03:19:30]  To put the animated  Series on DVD  Boy  If there are  I don't know  About it  You know  People keep writing  Into Universal  Ask them to do it  I frequently  Will call them up  And say  Hey people are  Clambling for this  But  No you just have  To get the bootlegs  I got a question  What are you having  For breakfast  A cup of coffee  And a bowl  Of blackberries  Ah very good  I just want to know  I know that the  Disc that just came out  Has the video 
[03:20:00]  From the ride  When that first  Came out  What did you think  Of it  Because I was amazed  At the  Back to the future  Ride  Oh  It was  Look  For me  You know  I never got to  Experience  Back to the future  Of the movie  The way everybody  Else did  Just walking into it  Saying holy shit  Yeah  So I got to go  Do the ride  And I said  Holy shit  Wow  I was  Sometimes  During our lunch breaks  When we had 
[03:20:30]  An office at Universal  My secretary and I  Would say  Hey  Let's  Let's go ride the ride  Oh you and the secretary  Yeah let's go ride the ride  And then we'll go  To the back to the future ride  And people are wondering  I'm reading a couple  Of things up here  Future Biff  When he goes in there  He looks a little  Out of sorts  When he gets out  And breaks his cane  Is that because  He is indeed  Disappearing  Because he has  Changed his own  Future  Yes  And if you  Whoever wrote that in 
[03:21:00]  If you get your  Hands on the DVD  And god damn it  Go out and buy it  Today  I got it my friend  In the deleted scenes  I'm pretty sure  We have the extension  On that  We actually had him  Erased from existence  And we previewed that  Previewed the movie  With that in it  And the audience  Just didn't understand it  Dumb audience  Half of them didn't  And we said  Well alright  Let's just  Let's just give him  A stomach ache  As he's getting out of a car  That'll clear it up 
[03:21:30]  For everyone  Give him a stomach ache  So Bob  Back to the future four  Go  Back to the future four  Yeah  Get out of here  What would it be  And let me ask you  The question  And see if you can  Come up with the  Accurate answer  When  In what  Time period  Is there the most  DeLoreans  In one spot  In the movie  Yeah  In the whole series  During which time  Is there the most  DeLoreans 
[03:22:00]  In one actual  Area  Are you talking about  About movie reality  Or when we were  Actually shooting  Oh I'm talking about  Movie reality  Screw the shooting  Of the movie  And how many  Of those cars  You went through  Who cares  I'm talking about  What it was  How many DeLoreans  Occupied  Thinking about it  I don't think  That there were  Ever more than  More than two  In the same  Wrong  Wrong  Mr. Ryder guy  Wrong  At the mall 
[03:22:30]  Given the reality  Of Back to the Future three  You had the two  DeLoreans  At the mall  And you had the one  Stashed in the cave  Two in the mall  One in the cave  It's like two in the  One in the stink  Two in the paint  No it's not like that  At all  It's a shocker  Danny please explain  I don't have my notes fully  Give me one moment  It's easy  Okay go  There's one  From  The old west  That is just  Sitting  Waiting in the cave  Waiting in the cave 
[03:23:00]  Right  There's that one  So that's there  The whole time  Up until 1985  Okay then there's  Right  Then there's  Okay then there's  Wait wait  What  That's until 1955  Until 1955  Right right  Okay so in 1955  There's one in the cave  One in the cave  There's the one that  Marty originally  Takes back in one  Right  Then there's  The one from two  The one from two  Where there's two  Martys in 1955  Right  So okay  So that's three  Three  And now the  The fourth one  Is 
[03:23:30]  In 1955  Isn't that when  Old Biff goes back  Oh yeah  To give  To give young  Biff the almanac  To give young Biff  The almanac  So that's  That's four  You still awake  I'm here  I'm here  But you guys aren't  You guys aren't  Figuring on the ripple effect here  Oh jeez  The alternate timeline  Yeah yeah  The veered off timeline  Every time you  Every time you change it  It makes a different timeline  Absolutely  Isn't that  Do you find that  Kind of funny 
[03:24:00]  That you  Are  That your story  Is kind of quoted  In science as  Well that's the  Back to the future  Style of time travel  I love it  And then there's  Yeah  I just love it  Yeah  You invented your own  Physics  Yeah  The branching  As opposed to  On Lost  If you watch that  These days  You see there  Is more of a  Linear time travel  Where you can only  Go backwards and forwards  And really not  Change anything  Yeah  Yeah well  Before us  It was a Ray Bradbury  Version  Bradbury did  You know 
[03:24:30]  He changed stuff  In that story  Called The Sound of Thunder  Where the  The hunting expeditions  Would go back  To prehistoric times  To kill dinosaurs  Oh right yeah  Remember that one  Yes  And then  Someone steps on a butterfly  Someone steps on one thing  And screws everything up  Which is why  The butterfly effect  Why they call it  The butterfly effect  In that  Ashton Kutcher movie  And boy  Doc Brown  For somebody  That didn't want to  Interfere with anything  In the future  He was one of the biggest  The worst offenders 
[03:25:00]  Ever  It's like  Kirk with the  Prime Directive  He'd always quote it  But then he'd just  You know  Have sex with women  On other planets  But it was  He was the biggest  Offender  Well  Yes  But we established  That at the end  Of the first  Back to the future  Where  You know  He pulls out  The letter taped up  And he says  Ah I figured  Ah what the hell  Yeah but what  Figuring what the hell  Is a little different  Than building a time machine  Into a steam  A steam engine train  And then showing up 
[03:25:30]  In the middle of  The fucking day  With you know  And then the train  Not only is that weird enough  That a train just appears  Out of nowhere  And this old man  From the 1800s  Pops out  But then the thing  Lifts up off the tracks  And flies away  At the end of the day  I mean that might raise  A few eyebrows  Don't you think  Well that's why  We put it at the very end  You don't think about that  Until you're  Until you're  Sitting over your pizza  Afterwards  Yeah  What the  What are those guys  And I love the police  Response time there  When a train hits a car  And uh  They could walk 
[03:26:00]  Over to Doc's  To come back  He walks home  Gets his chick  Comes back  Exchange gifts  Exchange gifts  Talk to Biff  You know  We're not talking  The NYPD  It's Hill Valley  Hill Valley  By the way  I also wanted to  Bring that up  That Mayor  Goldie Wilson  Turned out to be  An awful mayor  Because Hill Valley  Was a wonderful place  And then Goldie Wilson  Took over  And the theater  Is a porno theater  There's bums  Sleeping around  Crazy drunk drivers  Goldie Wilson  Stunk as a mayor 
[03:26:30]  Yeah he sure did  He sure did  Just wanted to  Add that in  Well you know something  I can't say enough  About the film  Shut up Jimmy  You know  Everybody here loves it  Except for two people  You said enough about it  About a half hour  Who think we talk about it  Much too much  And obsess on it  Too much  Bob  You can say anytime  Get a life  Because a lot of people  Are thinking it  We did our own screening  I would love to hear  This guy tell you guys  To get a life  I do have a question 
[03:27:00]  Though that I want  To ask you seriously  What is the best  Piece of memorabilia  That you own  From the movies  Very good  Oh man that's  Wow  I've got  Well the best piece  Is probably  The time displays  From the DeLorean  That got destroyed  Oh you got that  I've got those  In a showcase  Over my fireplace mantel  I've got a hover board  But there's a lot  There were a bunch  Of those  Yeah I hear that 
[03:27:30]  And then the other  Thing that  Our special tech  Supervisor  Took one of the  Mr. Fusions  And made it into  A lamp  You have a  Mr. Fusion lamp  Yeah that lamp  Used to sit on my desk  And so that's  Pretty cool  But the time displays  I think are  The number one  Well Bob  Let me tell you  Something  I just had a  14 seat theater  Put in my house  And Back to the Future  Is just played  Constantly  And I have a case 
[03:28:00]  That has gone in  And I really could use  Some Back to the Future  Memorabilia  What could you send me  For free?

[03:30:00]  Maybe  I think we should  You guys got his number  Just call him back  Yeah well  We got his number  You don't  No  He called here  That's how it works  With guests  They don't hand out  Our numbers  Good news  Bob Gale has called back  Anthony  Bob Gale has  Nah just kidding  Let's move on  With some other things  Almost getting out of here  Jimmy doesn't understand  Jimmy doesn't understand  How he likes the movie  I just want to say  It's not like we're sitting  There watching 
[03:30:30]  Cuckoo's Nest  It's you know  It's one of those movies  It's just goofy  It's good to get  If you watch it numerous times  You get these little  Idiosyncrasies  Or little things  That were put in  Or whatever  That you can share  With your friends  I'm going to try  Watching that again  I haven't watched it  In years  The Eric Stoltz  Goof on Biff  The Eric Stoltz info  Is very interesting  We're looking at  A still picture  Of Eric Stoltz  As Michael J. Fox's  Character in  Back to the Future  By the way  You can see these  And I did not know  That they filmed  A lot of the movie  With Eric Stoltz 
[03:31:00]  And then bailed on him  And then went with  Michael J. Fox  Our good friends  Our good friends  At bttf.com  I don't know how good  A friend to me they are  They sent me  An out of time  License plate  They sent me shit  Sent me an out of time  License plate  I got one  I got one  But it reminds me  Of famous actors  Auditioning for  Very famous roles  And not getting the part  And I remember  Seeing a video  Kind of a montage  Of this  It was Han Solo 
[03:31:30]  Was it Han Solo stuff  Maybe it was Star Wars  It was the audition tapes  For Han Solo  A few people did it  They did a goof on it  On Saturday Night Live  I think  Yeah  Or one of those shows  But I've seen others too  For other big movies  And they actually had  A test screening though  For Han Solo  I believe Christopher Walken  Did try out for it  No  I think so  For real?  I think so  Can we find that video?  He was in the deer hunters  He was certainly acting back then  And that was kind of a goof  That they did  I think  One of the goofs  Was Christopher Walken 
[03:32:00]  Doing it  Yeah there's others  It was Jay Moore  Who was doing the impression  So it was very funny  As seen on TV  We did a whole  Infomercial thing  So E-Rock ran this in  Hey kids  Why sit in front of the TV  When you can be on the radio  We're gonna roll this truck  In convoy  Across the USA  Convoy  That could be fun  Throw away  Your bulky transmitters  And broadcasting towers  The superstar celebrity microphone

[03:34:30]  I fucking forgot  About thirsty mice  Thirsty mouse  Good  Glad he reminded you  Your mice was thirsty  Let's say hi to Rich  In old town  Bring it on brother  Hey what's going on boys  Hey man  Hey buddy  What's going on about  Susan Powder  And Tony Little  The fitness commercials  Yeah  Yeah  They were  Pretty horrendous  Now it's all about  That other guy  What's his name  The workout  Fucking midges  Memorabilia website  Oh wait what

Fox  Spilled it  I have things  For every movie 
[03:35:30]  Oh what other movies  And  I don't know  You name a movie  I'll tell you what I got  Alright  What do you have  From like Star Wars  Maybe  I have  Some dirt  That Darth Vader  Stepped in  Oh  So it's a footprint  Of Darth Vader  No it's just  The footprint  Wasn't preserved  It's some dirt  That was under  The boot  Of James Earl Jones  Oh I thought  It was maybe  A plastic castle footprint  Which would kind of be cool  No it was originally  Tracked onto the carpet  By Orlando Calorissian  James Earl Jones 
[03:36:00]  Wasn't actually  In the Vader suit  That's why it's so rare Dale  It was actually  That big guy from  Yes David Prowse  Clockwork Orange  But one day  David  James Earl Jones  Showed up  And David said  Get that gigaboo  Out of my suit  I don't think he said that  It was very inappropriate  Very inappropriate  Nasty and rude  Yes I didn't care  For that type of talk  Yes you can't have  That kind of talk  About such a fantastic actor  I couldn't agree more  Anthony  Yes Gregory  Do you have anything  From the Godfather series  I certainly do  I have three 
[03:36:30]  Of Marlon Brando's  Mustache hairs  Mustache hairs  They fell out by the car  When he was shot  When Fredo  Fumbled with the weapon  I also had some  Gravel that was on the ground  That got caught  In his pant leg  When he fell  How could you get that  But not get something better  If you were that close  To get mustache hairs  And gravel  Couldn't you have gotten  Maybe the prop gun  That Fredo had  I had that  But I traded it  For the mustache hairs  And a piece of lemon pie  Oh okay 
[03:37:00]  I have very rare movie items  Do you have anything  Do you have anything  From The Shining  I bet Ant would love  Something from The Shining  I certainly do  I have red gelatin  That was used  To come out  The side of the door  I believe  Or maybe it was  On the children's head  Now  I have a swatch  Of carpeting  That was in room  501  Which wasn't featured  In the movie  There's no 501  That is  I cut  Yes  Sometimes 
[03:37:30]  Reposably false  I don't  I don't understand  Why you would have  Something like that  And not get something  From The Shining  Like one of the knives  I had the axe  That he was chasing  The boy with  Oh  But I traded it  For hedge seeds  Why would you  Want hedge seeds  So I could make  My own maze  In my living room  And run through it  For hours  But you had the axe  That's the  Like a key prop  From the movie 
[03:38:00]  That is the thing  To have  Yes I had that  But I was  Refused entry  On seven straight planes  I would carry my axe  And go here  I was checking this  I wish I had a  Scatman Crothers  Related piece  Oh wow  Imagine that  Yes  That painting  I used to have that  But I traded it  For the comforter  He was laying on  I have that  The comforter  And I have three  Of his giant  Black toenail clippings  I use them as visors  When I play cards  Well that's 
[03:38:30]  Very unique memorabilia  Yes it is  I don't see that  On ebay  Or anything like that  No it's very  Very hard to get things  Yes  Yes  A lot of stuff  Is easy  Yeah anyone  Who's getting  Those toenails  They certainly can  That movie  Is very frightening  Yes I was frightened  Watching it  I also have  The Continental Airlines  Seat that he sat in  Oh you do  Yes I do  I sit in my living room  When I watch television 
[03:39:00]  That actually sounds  Like a pretty good prop  Yes it is  It's not the original though  Oh wait a minute  It's actually the chair  They used in rehearsal  It's just a plastic chair  But they said  This is the one  He pretends to use  On the plane  So but Scatman  Sat in it  That's what I've been told  I spent $4,000 on that  I certainly hope so  And I traded Jack Nicholson's jacket  The jacket that he wore  The shining  I traded that  For the seat  That Scatman  Sat on  Allegedly 
[03:39:30]  That would have been  Something to have  I don't know  You hear the organ  That actually is playing  This music  Yeah you have that  No I'm just enjoying  The music with you  They wanted me to  Somebody tried to sell me this  But I didn't believe  It was the actual organ  You have anything  Speaking of Nicholson  From Cuckoo's Nest  That's a great  Yes I do  Oh  What do you got  What do you got  From Cuckoo's Nest  An indented pillow  Is it the pillow  That Chief used  I've been told  And I have broken glass 
[03:40:00]  From the window  That Chief  Threw the giant sink through  And I have water  From that sink  I drink it on a daily basis  Whatever happened to the sink  What's that  Whatever happened to the sink  I had that  I traded for shards of glass  Who needs a big heavy sink Gregory  You seem to have given away  A lot of good memorabilia  For stuff that people  Really wouldn't care about  I've had a bunch of  Bunk memorabilia  And I traded it  For rare items  Well I can't wait  To maybe come over  And see your collection

[03:43:30]  Twist what their message was  Into the most heinous  And awful situations  Possible  Oh yes  This homeless guy's  Ass shit  On this guy's face  Is brought to you  By 24 hour energy  That I'm going to miss  I'm going to miss that  Can you tell the story  Because I heard  From somebody  We blew up  We blew up  A spot for you  Oh the spot  Yeah  Which proves  That this guy  Was a soldier  All the way  You don't even have to 
[03:44:00]  I certainly can't  Mention the product  Yeah don't mention  The product  Did I blow one up  Oh you blew one up  Like never  And you know what  Never before  And I know we're  Having a little fun here  But this is the type  Of guy Will is  He never brought it  To our attention  I heard about this  Only like I think  Last week when  You know he announced  That he was leaving  Did they salvage it  The company  Oh well we just  Salvaged it this month  Three years later  That much time huh  Yes you did a splendid job  This was something  It was Exxon  Don't mention  Don't mention the product  But I was on my way  To a rather important meeting  This is a true story 
[03:44:30]  We were about to pitch  A couple of million dollars  To this specific product  And I was leaving  One of the  The XM Artist Confidentials  Yeah  And I get a call saying  Hey what  What happened  On the O&A show today  Somebody went off  On XYZ product  Like I have no idea  So I called the producer  At that time  Ben's hog  He's like  Oh dude  Jimmy went postal  Just went fucking nuts  I'll play you the audio  Oh jeez  So we finally get  To the appointment  And we're in the waiting room  And when Ben calls me back  He's like  Dude you 
[03:45:00]  You better buckle in  Jimmy calls this product  And I quote  A box of cock meat  There was some other  Choice words  It was actually  A box of cock meat  Was the  No  It was pussy meat  I got it completely wrong  He fucked it all up  So I go in  And literally  As I hang up the phone  I look at my  My colleague  And he's like  What did he say  I'm like  He called their product  A box of cock meat  He's like  Are you serious  I'm like  Yeah 
[03:45:30]  Oh no  Just then they bring us in  And it's  It's like the Trump boardroom  Where it's just  The big long table  And two little teeny chairs  And our  You know I'm dead  We're dead men walking  Yeah yeah  They come in  And they hit us with  What in God's name  Happened on the show  Who is this guy  Why would he say  Such a thing  And the only angle  I had  Was  Well you know  He's a comedian  He's a regular guest  Of the show  His job is to  Fire people up  And we see this  As a terrific opportunity  Oh Jesus Christ 
[03:46:00]  Good one  If you guys now  Do the right thing  And take care of this gentleman  Who's been complaining  You know about  The issue of service  That you're giving him  This could be the greatest thing  Since sliced bread  He could come on  And say  You know I was wrong  About this product  They're great  They're fantastic  The aristocrats  Yeah  Just crickets man  Get the fuck out  They looked at us  Leaned over and said  We don't really see it that way  Oh  Let us tell you  What's gonna happen  And from there  Things just went 
[03:46:30]  Horribly around  I do remember that  The good thing about Jimmy  Is  He's bitched about  So many products  I don't even know  Which one this is  Exactly  So it could be  A number of things  It could be  One of 50 things  But I guess  What happens is  With any product you buy  You're a consumer  Yes  So I think  Maybe this is a weakness  To me as a performer  I think  Like a consumer  And as a guy  Who's not happy  With something  More than I think  Of like  I should be thinking  Responsibly  Which is not good  For a company  I do that though  Sometimes 
[03:47:00]  So I've slipped  I've bitched  At a company  That I then got  Yelled at  For bitching at  A couple of times  The freedom of this  Environment  Let's you say things  That normally  You could never say  Yeah  You know  Calling something  I mean  A box of cock meat  Is a new one  Yes  In no business book  There's no book  On that one  No no  But there's a freezer  Full at Steve's house  Yes  Cock meat in a baggie  Exactly  I love it  But by the way  That product  MJ says I could have it  Yes  I have raved about one
