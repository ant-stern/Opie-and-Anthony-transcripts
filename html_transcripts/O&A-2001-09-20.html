<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with listener calls, one dedicating a song to overseas troops.  The hosts then discussed the somber post-9/11 atmosphere in New York City, intensified by the rain. John Valby called in, promoting his new song, "Taliban Blues," a disco-infused track with awkwardly offensive lyrics referencing the attacks.  A humorous exchange ensued about Valby encountering Opie's brother.  The hosts then shifted to "Operation Infinite Beer," an attempt to deliver Sam Adams beer to Ground Zero rescue workers.  Earl, using the "Wow Van" with John Ross, was repeatedly denied access by authorities despite assurances from "Psycho Mark," a Ground Zero contact who claimed significant influence.  A heated discussion ensued between the hosts, Psycho Mark, and Earl, generating increasingly absurd plans to circumvent security, all of which failed.  The hosts also mentioned sightings of Bill Murray and Colin Quinn. A listener criticized Earl’s repeated failed tasks.  The broadcast included discussion of Bill Maher's controversial comments on American cowardice, clips of Buddy Ebsen struggling with lyrics, and several poorly received listener-submitted tribute songs, including the particularly awful "America Lives in Us," which one caller claimed was plagiarized.  The hosts played and mocked these "Monsters of Midday" creations throughout the show, frequently guessing their rhymes.

A phone interview with Scorch, a Central New York radio host, followed. He described upcoming segments: "Douche or Dressing" (a blindfolded taste test) and "The Weakest Dink" (an erectile dysfunction contest with a Vegas nude whorehouse prize). The potential for these segments to be stolen was discussed.  The conversation returned to Operation Infinite Beer, detailing Earl's continued struggles with police.  Further discussion covered the rising number of missing persons, an upcoming interview with Steve Austin and Kurt Angle, a future guest appearance by Shano Mack, and a caller's dismissal of sympathy cards to victims' families.  A brief call with Shane McMahon included discussion of his family's image and Stephanie McMahon's breast implants, with humorous anecdotes about post-surgical care.  Jerry "The King" Lawler's relationship troubles and WWF firing were also mentioned, alongside a New York Sports Clubs promotion.

A substantial segment focused on Shane McMahon's wrestling career and bachelor party, featuring studio guest Jim Norton and humorous anecdotes and clips from the event, including Jim Norton's performance and interactions with Vince McMahon. The conversation shifted to patriotic songs and tributes, with the hosts playing and mocking several "bad" examples, many from "Prep Burger." A caller criticized this mockery.  John Valby’s highly offensive, anti-Osama Bin Laden song was also played, with promises of unedited versions on their website.  The show also covered negative market reactions to the day's events and the crew's struggles delivering beer to a bar due to security. A "bad" tribute song from a Sacramento radio station was played. A listener's anti-Osama Bin Laden song was played, followed by a comedic "What Did We Learn?" segment.

The "What Did We Learn?" segment featured caller observations, including: Earl’s new nickname ("Mr. E"); C-3PO's copyrighted tribute song; Earl's attraction to Psycho Mark; the pathetic nature of tribute songs; Stephanie McMahon's large breasts; Neil Diamond's musical talent; Norton's colon-sourced banana splits; Prep Burger's role in societal marriage; Scorch's naked bit creation; and the halting of Operation ONA Kager due to insufficient looping.  The hosts promoted an event supporting Paisano's restaurant and mentioned receiving collector's item toys from McFarland Toys (Jaws and Leatherface).  The show concluded with crude sex jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good God!  Hey, man.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Just trying to pump some adrenaline back into society.  Uh-huh.  What's up, Jeff?  Yo.  What's up, Jeff?  Hello.  Jeff, you're on the radio.  What a way to talk to Joe, guys.  Well, we do that every day.  That says it all right there, though.  We're taking suggestions, so.  It's almost like we brought back Penny W. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  I can just picture the guys on the boat right now listening to that.  Get ready to blow them up.  If that doesn't get you psyched.  All right, thank you, Jeff.  All right, later.  Bye.  Let's go to Bobby.  Bobby, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  I just want to lift my hat off to you guys, and I know you can't dedicate songs on radio stations anymore.  I want to dedicate that to all men and women that are going overseas and kicking in a lot of butt.  I think that was obvious to everyone. 
[00:01:00]  You've got it.  All right, Bobby.  Thanks.  Good one.  All right.  Later.  I wanted to play break stuff, because I got so much anger, I just need to break things.  Break something.  But a lot of people wanted to hear that one to start the show tonight, so.  Oh, yeah.  There you have it.  There you go.  Well, how are you, my friend?  All right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Doing all right.  You know, we're getting through.  Moving on.  As they say, waiting for the big attack that, I don't know, I don't know what's going to come.  It's raining today in New York, which just makes it even that much more creepier. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I kind of thought it was better.  It's easier to deal with all the crap around us when it's a really nice day with blue skies.  When the rain comes, it's just, ugh.  It sounds a little bad and a little selfish on my part, but I was almost glad for it.  Because driving in, I couldn't see the skyline.  Norton, you with me on that one?  Yeah, we're with you.  I was coming out on the BQE.  Yeah.  And every day now, you know, it's right to my left.  You look over, and everyone slows down, and you have to look.  And it kind of gives you a whole feeling of remembering what happened a week ago, whatever. 
[00:02:00]  And today, it's just covered in fog and clouds and stuff, so I couldn't see it.  I was like, oh, okay, good.  Yeah, I hope not having to really look at it.  Yeah.  That's right out of mind.  Oh, John Valby's calling in.  Who's talking to him?  Rick.  Well, just tell Rick to put him on hold.  It's obvious that John Valby wasn't going to call today.  A couple phone numbers.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[00:02:30]  Anywhere else, please give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  Or write that number down, because eventually you're going to want to call us,  because we're kind of like a people's radio show.  We really enjoy when you guys help us out with the radio program, okay?  The people's radio show.  866-277-4WOW.  Let's talk to John Valby right away.  John.  Hey, how are you?  John Valby.  What's going on, bro?  Oh, hey, listen, I did a Taliban blues song for you.  I heard you guys yesterday in Buffalo, 
[00:03:00]  and it seemed like you wanted something a little more Valby-esque,  so I did it for you.  You are listening to this show yesterday, are you?  Well, not for a whole lot, but I listened to some of it.  See, I don't like this syndication thing,  because, you know, we like making fun of our friends,  but we don't want them to hear that we're making fun of them.  Did you like our suggestions for a couple of hey-lotties and gang bangs?  Yeah, yeah, I did it to the outhouse blues.  Oh, good.  I only changed it to the Taliban blues  and did a double verse instead of a single verse, 
[00:03:30]  and I think there's four or five pretty good ones in there, man.  All right.  Are you still?  No, no, I'm trying to e-mail it to you.  Yeah, we'll get it.  We can have you send it to Steve saying that.  Take care of that.  Ah!  But I ran into your brother.  I played the Friday night after down in Wildwood, New Jersey for a fireman's thing,  only they canceled the fire parade,  and, you know, the firemen were sitting on their porches with the candles.  Yeah.  It was really neat, but I saw your brother there. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, cool.  Brother Joe?  Oh, Opie's brother?  Oh, my brother?  Yeah.  Which one?  I got about ten or so.  He was an Irish guy.  Everyone thinks we're Irish.  We're mutts.  You're mutts?  You're American mutts?  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  We love everything.  Yeah.  Did he have very blonde hair?  Gee, could his name have been Kevin?  I have a cousin, Kevin.  Was his name Quinn?  You know...  Was he circumcised?  I have Alzheimer's. 
[00:04:30]  How many beers did you have when you met my so-called brother?  Yeah, it was three or four.  I was three or four in.  All right.  Yeah.  Early in the night.  Yeah.  John, people making fun of your song from yesterday.  Oh, that's okay.  Yeah.  You know, I give it out.  I've got to be able to take it, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you're going to...  You know, my wife sent that, and that was just something I was doing for myself at home.  Right.  And I didn't want her to send that.  Ah, cool.  Backpedal.  Nice, John.  Nice. 
[00:05:00]  Now, wait a minute.  I'm just telling you, I wasn't putting it out.  Right.  Now, a million people have heard your work, so...  Oh, well.  Well, we look forward to the new one, John.  Okay, yeah.  All right.  Hey, thanks.  All right, bro.  Thanks, John.  Bye.  Okay, bye.  John Valby from Buffalo.  There he goes.  This is the song we're talking about from yesterday.  You got it.  It's really bad.  Oh, God.  I enjoyed it.  You like this one?  Yeah.  Today, we were at 9, 11, 2004. 
[00:05:30]  And as they cheer to the streets of Palestine, they cry to the streets of New York.  Oh, we will not give in. 
[00:06:00]  Be quiet.  We will not kill innocent people for our lives.  Be quiet, John.  Be quiet, John.  We're America.  We really believe in freedom.  And justice.  Oh, wow.  And justice is what's common to you, Osama.  You ready? 
[00:06:30]  All you Islam and Jihad.  I got, I got sort of a kind of brain.  Let me get you.  Well, you come on all day.  I got all my demons.  I've been alive.  Now we're ready to fight.  Let me get you.  I got a man in the wild.  Let me get you.  I got a man in the wild.  I'm in the basement.  I'm in the cave.  But the game ain't over until you're in your grave. 
[00:07:00]  Let me get you.  I got a man in the wild.  When the dark smoke, the Pentagon burn.  No sound in line.  Now it's your turn.  Hey.  What about you people?  I'm in the dark.  See this and that.  Because you ain't no sound in line.  You're the real thing.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  The powers came down on the street today.  Quiet, I mean, I'm still sick.  In the U.S.A. 
[00:07:30]  Quiet.  Shut up.  No.  Stay out of the bushes.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  John?  Me too.  John?  Yes?  You calling back?  Hello?  Hey.  Hey.  It's MC Valby.  What's up?  Oh, I'm just trying to get a proper e-mail address.  That's all.  Oh, okay. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, we just played your song again.  Oh, man.  You're hurting me now.  That's kind of a disco thing happening there.  A little John Valby rapping.  Yeah.  And, you know, man, I wasn't done with that.  I'm sorry.  I know you're not supposed to really care.  It doesn't matter, you know.  But you've got to listen to this other one.  This other one's the style that you're used to.  Okay.  All right.  We look forward to it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to hang on until somebody tells me how to get an e-mail. 
[00:08:30]  Hayden and Satan rhyme, though.  Yeah.  Satan?  Yeah.  Hayden, they rhymed.  Yeah, that rhymed nicely.  Vanilla.  Valby?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  There were a few rhymes.  It just didn't have a lot of pizzazz to it.  Anyway, I was sad.  I did that the day of the thing.  The afternoon of the thing.  I mean, you know.  Right.  I wasn't exactly in a funny mood.  Okay.  Anyway.  Thanks for understanding.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  There he goes. 
[00:09:00]  John Valby.  Yes.  He's looking for an e-mail address.  All right.  You want to get into the Psycho Mark thing or what?  Yeah.  Let's talk about that whole situation.  All right.  We need Earl in here in order to do that.  Earl's to your right ant.  It's an integral part of this.  Earl Crabble might go over there.  Well, we've got to explain.  Obviously, Ground Zero.  A lot going on.  And we were trying to do our part.  And we found out that one of the bars down there is giving away a lot of free beer to all the rescuers. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  They're off time.  They like to throw a few back with the rest of the guys.  You know, it's tough down there, as everyone knows.  It's kind of nice to unwind after the shift and drink some beer.  So, we know Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  We decided we were going to have him send a bunch of kegs down here.  Well, this all started with Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark called us and said, look, these guys can really use some beer.  We've run out.  And these guys are working hard.  And they're hanging out.  And, yeah, like you said, drinking in between shifts and stuff. 
[00:10:00]  So, you know, maybe we can get some kegs down there.  So, we had Jim Cook on the line.  And he said, sure.  And we got the kegs.  Well, today was the day to get the kegs down to the bar.  And in the studio is Earl, one of the guys that drove the Wow Van down to Ground Zero with the kegs of beer.  With who?  John Ross?  John Ross.  Yeah.  And what happened?  Are they real happy to get their beer supply?  We're glad we can help.  Yes, of course.  We were basically told to turn around.  Turn around. 
[00:10:30]  We needed a work order.  We needed all these.  We needed paperwork.  Turn around, bright eyes.  Oh, stupid Neil.  I didn't even do that song.  So, you were told to turn around.  Turn around.  But we're delivering our free beer.  We were stopped by federal, state, and local authorities.  Were they racially profiling you, Earl?  No, they weren't.  Was there anybody that would have gone down there with a van? 
[00:11:00]  So, the federal agents stopped you?  Everybody stopped us.  There's like three tiers of stoppage.  Oh, boy.  You didn't even get close to delivering the beer.  Nowhere near it.  And what did they tell you?  They said we needed a work order.  They just basically said we needed a ton of paperwork.  But Psycho Mark said it was easy.  Yeah, here's where Psycho Mark comes into this story.  We assumed, silly us, that we'd be able to take the beer down there because we were told by Psycho Mark.  Well, apparently, if you listen to Psycho Mark, he's running the whole show down there. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  He's taking care of the rescue effort, recovery, the investigation, everything.  He's actually telling Giuliani what to do here in New York City.  Psycho Mark told Earl that he could go down there and just tell him, you know Psycho Mark, and you'll get in.  Is that the case, Mark?  Dude, a Girl Scout with a Girl Scout box cookies could stop Earl from going down the street, okay? 
[00:12:00]  All right, Earl, you are a wimp.  First of all, I was not driving.  Dude, why don't you throw the kegs in the river and let them down.  Here's a better idea, Mark.  Here's a better idea.  Why don't you pick up the kegs yourself and deliver them over there since you're running the drive?  You know what?  I will.  As soon as I'm off my shift, I get off at midnight tonight, okay?  Oh, by the way, I heard another story.  I heard the bars were eating a beer.  They only had one day.  Hold on, hold on.  You're both talking at the same time.  Earl, what?  I heard the bars were fine. 
[00:12:30]  They were all stopped with beer.  They just went that one day without delivery.  Mark, is there beer down there?  They can't, but they could always use more.  Of course, I'm thinking they could always use more.  You made the weakest attempt in the entire face of the universe.  Again, we went through three tiers of cops, essentially.  Let's get John in here.  Where's John?  Is John listening to the show?  If he is, come running down the hall.  Earl, is it possible for you to put the kegs on your head and walk them down? 
[00:13:00]  No, at one point they said you might have to carry them, but we got four kegs in the van.  Well, hand trucks.  Why didn't Psycho Mark hang up on us?  He might have just gotten cut off.  Oh, all right.  I'm sure he'll call back.  He'll take another hand.  When it comes to airtime, Psycho Mark, we'll call back.  Believe me.  So here's the problem.  We have the kegs of beer, and we were not able to deliver them today.  Right?  We just want to get some beer down there. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Mark.  Oh, that sounds so much better.  Thank God.  Mark.  So how are we going to get the beer to you?  Dude, listen to me.  It's very simple.  We're all down here.  Any press person can get by.  All you have to do is you have to go up to talk to the head cop.  You say, look, here, I work for the press.  I did it out of it.  You've got to talk to them.  You have to get out and explain to them why you need to get by.  If you can talk a good story, you can get down here.  Oh, gee, now you've got to be a con man.  It's not being about a con man.  It's just having a little common sense.  So you feel that Earl didn't do his job today? 
[00:14:00]  I'll get the beer in here.  I'll meet you guys at midnight, because that's when I get off my shift.  Dude, they're going to be drinking until four in the morning, Anthony.  No, I didn't say that.  I'm just thinking midnight is kind of at a lake.  What is this, Operation Deep Throat?  I know.  Meet me.  I'll have the kegs.  You know?  Earl, did you make any attempt to try and go up?  Let me explain our situation.  We got stopped by a guy.  They turned you back, and you came behind like a girl. 
[00:14:30]  All right, hold on, Mark, because now John's in the studio as well.  And John's saying that they got stopped by FBI agents.  What did you tell them?  FBI agent.  They're making a delivery.  And what did they say?  Well, you need like a PO or, you know.  Morons.  Did you try to tell them, look, we're from the O&A show.  We got some beer for the guys.  Not drop something off.  It sounds like, you know, you're sending people.  You know, we had kegs in the back.  They, you know, peeked their head in and looked.  And they were like, no.  See, you're morons. 
[00:15:00]  You're not making a delivery.  You're bringing in Steve's supplies.  So, Mark, where are they supposed to go with the beer?  Well, Mark, you dropped it off at the bar.  Look, I gave you guys this idea, okay?  I'm down here.  I'm busy working.  It's a great idea.  I thought it was the bar's idea.  Operation Infinite Beer.  A chance to take the ball and run with it.  And that's Earl.  You know, or Ben or somebody.  Somebody with a press pass.  You can get in here.  You just have to talk to the right cop. 
[00:15:30]  Well, we still have four kegs of beer that need to get down to the guys.  Earl, could we put a mohawk on your head and some gold jewelry and you hop in the van and just go,  Hey, fool, I'm bringing the beer down to the boys.  I'm putting the poor fool.  Stop me from making my leave.  Can you do that?  Paint it like the A-Team van?  Hey, Hannibal.  All right.  We got to get that beer down there.  Mark, Mark.  For the kids.  Mark, you tell us what to do.  We will send Earl out with John right now with his cell phone and we'll try to deliver the beer.  Live on the show.  When you get down there, tell him that I am Earl. 
[00:16:00]  I am Black Earl from the O&A show, officer.  How are you?  You go right to the sergeant.  Those federal agents have no idea who you are.  You are so effing stupid.  Just listen to me.  For one second.  You go right to the head sergeant.  A white shirt.  You dumb F.  Okay?  You go up to him.  You park the van down the street.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Put the bar down for us, Jeffrey.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Does the three letters F-B-I mean anything to you?  Shut up.  He told them. 
[00:16:30]  Does the Federal Bureau of Investigation mean anything to you?  Does automatic weapon carrying men mean anything to you?  FBI.  Dude, you just said it.  FBI.  The big yellow jacket.  The letters on the jacket.  Don't go near them.  Don't go near them.  They came up to the van, Mark.  Well, obviously, listen to me.  This is what you've got to do.  You've got to park the van a block back.  You walk in.  You talk to the head of security at a checkpoint. 
[00:17:00]  You know they're carrying kegs?  Wait, you want them to carry the kegs in, Mark?  Listen to me.  No, no, no.  You don't carry them in.  You put the van a block back.  You walk up.  You talk to the head cop at that checkpoint.  You say, officer, I have a van here full of beer for the bar over here that we're donating.  We want to get these donated supplies in, okay?  The HNIC?  Who is there?  You talk to, Earl?  Say, brother, come on in.  You got them beers when they're in there and deliver them. 
[00:17:30]  You guys might have to try this live on the show.  You know something?  You really might have to go on another run now.  I'm not going to get it.  The beer's got to get through.  Stay in school.  Don't take drugs.  How many FBI agents did you guys come across?  There was six cops in the checkpoint.  I think three of them.  There was at least three of them.  Mark, you want to meet them at the border?  It is like Border Patrol down there.  I can't right now.  I'm on top of the live shop right next to Liberty.  One Liberty. 
[00:18:00]  We're looking right down inside the mess.  I don't know if you'll see it on Fox, but I'm right behind that camera right now.  We've all seen the shot.  Oh, no.  This is a new shot we just set up today.  Oh, goody.  Can't wait to check this out.  Yeah, Jesus.  What a ball.  Well, that's what the coverage has come down to.  Oh, we've got a new angle.  Check out this angle of the complete devastation.  Well, we need to see this stuff, unfortunately, you know.  We've seen it.  It's not going away.  Yeah, but you know what?  Yeah, we've seen it, but you can't forget it.  We're not going to forget it.  But we need to watch. 
[00:18:30]  How do we get the beer down?  The beer.  Here we go.  Let's get back to the beer.  We'll try to get it.  It's more important.  Operation Infinite Beer.  What do we do next?  Just to have Earl use his brain.  And use a little common sense and try and finagle your way through the same.  I use common sense.  Yeah, when confronted by an FBI.  You ran like a girl.  A girl with a lollipop would have turned you away.  All right.  Mark, tell them exactly where to go, and we'll send them out.  Come right back.  Earl, you've got to go.  It'll be hilarious.  No, I want no point. 
[00:19:00]  Down to the Barrick Street, but again.  It doesn't matter.  Earl's not going.  Fine.  Because he's not an American.  I'm not going to be an American.  Anti-American right now, Earl.  Screw you.  I'm not.  Is American anyone?  New York's greatest and finest are sitting down here waiting for beers.  You've got to go above and beyond and then get the delivery through.  Yeah, Earl, everyone's going above and beyond.  Dude, the answer is not no.  You don't turn around after the first guy tells you no.  You take the second one.  And then we turn around after the sixth guy.  After the third checkpoint.  Because you guys, you guys drive in. 
[00:19:30]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Hello, hello.  All right.  Calm the F down.  You guys drive in with an F in black van.  Looks very suspicious with the brother driving in.  You want to give us a new van?  Okay, okay.  Hold on.  Mark the van says, open Anthony, wow.  That's not too suspicious.  I know that.  But look.  Vinny from Rosedale's got a great point.  He goes, wait a minute.  Mark, you're making my argument.  You're making my argument for me.  You're doing it for me.  Vinny from Rosedale says, wait a minute. 
[00:20:00]  Isn't this the plot of Smokey and the Bandit?  Which is true.  Deliver the beer and the law is trying to keep your brother.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Eastbound and down, loaded up and trucking.  That Earl is an attention-giver.  Now on my watch, the goddamn German's got nothing to do with it.  I am Sheriff Brantford.  I need a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  Make it snappy. 
[00:20:30]  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Earl's Jerry Reed and Marcus Burt Reynolds.  There we go.  What you need is a diversion vehicle, like, let's say, a Trans Am.  And then the truck can get right through.  We'll call him the dumbass.  Earl, Earl, we'll send you down the border.  You make believe you're selling drugs over to Zidane. 
[00:21:00]  And then while they're looking at you, John Rossi will sneak through it.  While they riddle me with bullets.  Remember what I said, Earl.  Talk to the head guy in charge.  The head and in charge.  Okay?  And go over to him and say,  Say, cuz, you got some beers in here, mofo.  And we need to bring him in for the boys.  You know, just sweet talk.  All right, hold on.  Someone else wants in on this.  Tom.  Hey, Tom, you're on with Psycho Mark.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Dude, listen, we do shipping over here about an hour ago.  I got a fax from FEMA. 
[00:21:30]  And it says, don't pick up any delaying of loads, volunteer drivers, blah, blah, blah.  But it says, only authorized deliveries that have a manifest or bill of lading will be allowed in the disaster area.  Uh-huh.  That's right.  Black time.  Well, yes, I've heard a thousand things like that.  I don't care about no manifest.  We got to get this Drew Hannibal for the kids.  Well, this one kind of black guy beat the cops.  Oh, ouch.  Come on.  We got to follow it up with that nasty comment. 
[00:22:00]  Yes, bail out.  All I know is I'll get that man through at midnight as soon as I get off.  As soon as I can get down there.  All right, Mark.  What's the name of this top cop, as you keep calling it?  It's no top cop, sir.  Earl, you just have to go up to an interim show.  You're a Buford T. Justice.  You're a Buford T. Justice.  Let's set up a ramp and you can just jump over the checkpoint. 
[00:22:30]  I told him for knocking down mailboxes.  Brought a girl across the state lines.  That's a man act.  Hopi, get him a raft and have him raft the beer in.  He can come in through Battery Park.  Hey, boy.  I'm talking to you.  Sorry, Earl.  You seem to lie taller on the radio.  Get a hand truck and roll the keg in.  Smokey and the Bandit rules.  There we go.  All right, well. 
[00:23:00]  Just try and get it in.  I mean, you guys, you can get it in.  You just have to talk to the right person.  Operation Infinite Beer is a bust.  Man.  It's not a bust, guys.  Don't give up now.  Country needs us.  Terrorists are keeping beer from the people down there.  Pretty much.  We put our best man on the job, so obviously it's...  Earl.  Yeah, right.  Hire the handicapped.  They're fun to watch.  How many hits you have today, Mark?  Oh, wait.  How many what?  How many hits you have today?  Two.  Me hitting myself and then me hitting you. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Not enough, Earl, brother.  Trust me.  When you're down here, I need a lot more than just weed.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Look, I try and get that in, and if not, I'll meet you guys at midnight, and I will get that beer.  Murdoch, get a plane.  We'll fly it in.  For the kids.  Go get Pedro Guerrero.  He can get it in.  Murdoch, we've got to get the beer in.  Thank you, Mark.  Stay in school.  Bye, guys.  The kegs are waiting for you at the station.  All right.  See you later.  Bye.  Why do you need to bring them beer? 
[00:24:00]  Who's hanging out till midnight, though?  Dummy.  All right, well, here you have it.  That's a bust.  Wow.  That wasn't very successful.  No.  Even at the white guy driving.  Well, what are we going to do?  I'll feel guilty drinking it all ourselves.  We can't drink that beer.  No, we've got to get it down there somehow.  We'll figure it out.  Maybe we can bring it to a couple of the firehouses.  That might help, too.  Yeah, there's one.  Like, there's one right down the street. 
[00:24:30]  Right down on 8th Avenue.  They just...  Plus, there's funerals going all over the city, too.  Do you suggest we bring a kegs to a funeral, Earl?  Is that what...  You're not listening to me!  In my horror, is that what I just heard you suggesting?  You didn't let me finish.  Bringing a kegs to a...  Who's following?  No, I'm saying...  You'll be the life of the party.  No, I'm saying...  I'm saying there's funerals going on all over the city.  Really?  It might not be in good taste to bring beer.  To the firehouses?  Sure.  Absolutely.  They need beer down there. 
[00:25:00]  That's what I was going to say before you...  You pounded a lot of funerals going on.  Yeah, let me finish.  All right, well, okay.  Get off the door.  On the way, we'll play the latest from John Valby.  This thing is who?  A song he's very proud of, Anthony?  Yeah, yes.  The new one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And we also have a couple more, what, songs?  You know what...  A couple more tribute songs?  Ron and Fez had one on their show last night that was really bad that they said they were  going to leave for us, by the way.  Cool. 
[00:25:30]  Maybe that's laying around, too.  Someone on Instant Feedback said, John Valby sounded like that clip of Buddy Ebsen when  he couldn't remember the words to the Beverly Hillbillies song.  He was just like, oh, I'm sorry.  And then...  Because Valby kind of sounded like that when he was backpedaling about his song.  Well, now we've got to play that clip as we go to the right.  The disco version of...  Sounded like...  What was that duck song?  That disco duck.  Disco duck.  It sounded like safety dance.  A little safety dance.  A little bit also the Blondie song, Rapture. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Cassio.  Rock Me Amadeus by Paco.  Well, here's Buddy Ebsen.  Yes.  Called him and we asked him to sing the theme song.  And you realize how old he is by hearing this clip.  This one's very uncomfortable.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer, barely kept  his family fed.  And then one day...  Oh, he...  But he never... 
[00:26:30]  When I...  I'm still writing it.  When people...  I'm sorry.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  OVSN.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  That's right.  We can't leave anything alone.

And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:28:00]  G-C-H-A-N.  Gotta go right to...  Ah!  Every day.  Oh.  The phone don't work for the...  The phone don't work.  I don't think so.  We'll fix that.  Hopefully, uh...  Every day we say this, but, uh...  Oops, now he's gone.  Ah, yeah, it's not working.  Just wrecked the whole flow of the show.  Broken.  Oops.  We'll just sit here awkwardly as we try to figure out what's wrong with the national phone  line.  Every day.  Every day. 
[00:28:30]  Every day.  Okay.  Now we hung up on him.  I think that's something good.  That was going to lead to about 20 minutes already.  No problem.  Let's make an offense to go long.  Oh, yeah, that's him.  There you go.  You hear him?  Thank you, Ken.  That was great.  Now we'll, uh...  We'll riff on that in 20 minutes.  No problem.  How does that happen on a daily basis?  Every day.  Why is that?  Why does that happen every day?  Like, what is it?  Because, Ben, you fix it.  But I don't know what it is in the first place.  It's going to get fixed because that computer screen crashed when we first started the show. 
[00:29:00]  When we started the show.  But the computer screen didn't crash yesterday when the same exact thing happened.  No, it didn't happen yesterday.  It was fixed yesterday.  No, it happened yesterday.  It happened yesterday.  Sure?  Yeah.  It happens every day.  No, it didn't happen yesterday.  It happens every single day.  We could ask the listeners.  They're hearing the same exact thing every day.  You go to the national...  Nothing.  Well, basically, Ken wanted to say that, um...  Nah, it doesn't matter.  I forgot. 
[00:29:30]  Earl was around during the revolution.  Oh, there he is.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh.  Timing's everything in comedy, ladies and gentlemen.  Ken!  Hey, Ken.  You got a cute little thing about what we just did on the radio 20 minutes ago?  Yeah, I did.  All right.  Hey, thank God it wasn't Black Earl Revere during the Revolutionary War, or else right  now we'd be a nation of bad teeth, and our national dish would be kidney pie.  Oh!  Wow. 
[00:30:00]  Nice.  Oh!  Thank you, Ken.  Hey, you guys suck even more.  All right.  I think the people loved that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They loved that.  Jesus, man.  See, but see, like, that quick comment from Ken would have been perfect over the Metallica  music, you know what I mean?  And then we get into something else.  Well, you're missing the point.  There's no way Earl could have been Paul Revere.  His job would have been to bring the horse back to the stable.  Jesus, Norton.  Are they going to try to go back there? 
[00:30:30]  Ah, they're working on Earl.  They're working on Earl.  Earl doesn't want to go.  They left.  Earl somehow, I think he was probably told that he had to go.  Had to go.  All right, they're on their way, so we will check in with them a little later and see  if we can't work our way in there.  It's called Operation Infinite Beer.  Infinite Beer, because when they run out of that, we'll bring more.  Yeah.  So this is our second try at trying to get the beer past the FBI.  The FBI. 
[00:31:00]  Doug from Springfield, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Good to hear you.  You guys got to play that dice bit again today.  It was hysterical.  We had dice on the air yesterday for the first time in quite a while.  It was the first time since we've been national, and the guy never disappoints.  One more thing.  Why do you keep giving Earl all these important things to do?  Why can't you just let him, like, get your water, make coffee?  Doug?  Well?  We love making fun of Earl, but I have a feeling, and I think I can talk for all the guys today,  I think this is psycho Mark's problem. 
[00:31:30]  Ah.  I really do.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh, ho.  Ah, ha.  Okay, later, guys.  Okay, Pookie.  Okay, Pookie.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Ah.  Later, guys.  All right, bro.  How about a Frisker?  Speaking of which, we saw Bill Murray downstairs.  You did?  I learned that he's not an actor.  Really?  Yeah, he was parking his car.  We all park our car.  We're going out for lunch, and he's getting out of his car, and he was just acting like 
[00:32:00]  every role you've seen him in.  Really?  And then I'm like, oh, my God, this is not an act.  This is him on screen.  He couldn't figure out, you know, what the process was of parking his car in the garage  and stuff.  Oh, he didn't know.  He had the big, goofy, groundkeeper-type hat on.  Did he have that hat on?  Yeah.  The car hat?  Yeah, or something very similar to it.  Yeah, I'm looking for a ticket so I can park my car.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole!  It's in the hole! 
[00:32:30]  Cinderella boy tears in his eyes, I guess.  He lines up his last shot.  He's got about 250 yards.  He's going to use about a phone.  Oh, he got a lot of that one.  And then, walking back from lunch, we see Colin Quinn.  So, it was SNL day today.  He's going to come in next week.  He was on the way to OTB or something.  EAF from New York.  Yes.  You've got the Hans Gruber reference.  Very good.  People very smart listening to this show. 
[00:33:00]  Hans Gruber.  George, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I was thinking maybe Opie could try and get the beer in there, see if he can get  the DVD porn in his house.  Oh, you see, you're going to...  Well, actually, you got caught, so...  Well, he got caught, but maybe he could get it in there.  And now the porn sits in my book bag.  Now I don't know what to do with it.  Send it to my house.  Where and when were you going to watch this porn?  Oh, oh.  If you took it home and Sandy found it in your bag... 
[00:33:30]  I've got my little portable DVD player.  I can watch it anywhere in the house.  Oh, I got in the bathroom.  I'm just watching a DVD in here.  Right.  All right, you guys suck.  Thanks.  That was such a sad, pathetic story.  You know, maybe the beer could be gotten downtown if Sandy wraps it in tinfoil and writes brownies  on it.  My chick, like, makes brownies for the whole staff, doing her part.  Doing her part to make everyone feel a little bit better and made homemade brownies and wrapped 
[00:34:00]  them in tinfoil and cute little dishes and little notes on the tinfoil.  That's cute.  There you go.  And she's packing it into my book bag so I can bring in for all you guys.  She sees my nasty, dirty DVD porn.  It was up in Comers, and they didn't know how to spell Comers.  Because it wasn't quite the way I've seen it spelled in school and stuff.  Yeah, Mr. Fincher didn't teach me how to spell Com that way.  Comers.  Yeah, I don't understand.  But, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  She found it, and I don't know how you watch it, though.  What do you mean?  She passes out?  Yeah, with one eye open.  Catches you.  I don't like those porn DVDs, man.  Why?  I don't, because they try to put too much into it.  Like, the videos, you could just get, you go to the store, you get your porn video or whatever,  and you throw it in.  You can go halfway through it.  You can just turn it on and take up where you left off last time you were watching it for five minutes. 
[00:35:00]  The DVDs, they're all, ooh, it's interactive.  You get to position the girl like you want.  No.  I want to sit back.  I don't want to have a remote in my hand.  Believe me, my hands are full.  I don't want a remote there.  I don't want to, and then you feel bad because you don't want to touch the remote.  You've had your hand on your nasty, disgusting junk, and the rest of the family and stuff has to use that remote.  So, you're going through the interactive DVD, ooh, what room should I go in? 
[00:35:30]  You think way too much.  No, the DVDs think too much.  Who cares if your mom or your pops or whatever is picking up the remote?  Oh, my God, you have your disgusting junk in your hand, and you work in the remote, and here's, you know, your mom picks it up.  Ooh, let me see if my programs are on today.  Don't worry about that thought.  You shouldn't touch any doorknobs around here.  I don't.  Or just do what I do.  I just try not to.  You have your mom sit next to you, and you go, fast forward now.  You are disgusting. 
[00:36:00]  That rocks.  Hey, Michael, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Yeah, what's up, Michael?  You guys rock.  I wanted to see if you guys heard the Bill Maher comment, that scumbag, what he said about Americans being cowards and how he bombed from 200 miles away.  Yeah, the 2,000.  Yeah.  This guy is such a...  We've been telling you guys for years how much of a douchebag he is.  He needs to be Dickie Betts so fast.  Norton needs to go over and slap him.  Dickie Betts.  Nice.  No one likes this guy.  You know, a bunch of people will argue that he's allowed to say things like this because it's American and all that. 
[00:36:30]  But you know what?  It's a very sensitive time right now, and everyone's got to be on the same page.  And he's just being a dick.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe he said it.  He absolutely is allowed to say anything that he wants, as we are here for the most part on our show.  But the thing is, you then pay consequences.  We've paid consequences for things we've said.  Now he's got to pay the consequences for those remarks.  What an idiot.  His true colors are coming out, which I couldn't be happier about. 
[00:37:00]  There was a valid point to be made in part of what he was saying, but this moron, the way he says it, and other things he added in, are just ridiculous.  And it shows how pompous he thinks he is.  Mr. Know-it-all.  Yeah.  He sits there during that show, and we've interviewed him.  We interviewed him about, oh, God, it's got to be five, six years ago.  Yeah, when he was first starting the Politically Incorrect show.  And this is the guy that wouldn't say a word. 
[00:37:30]  We asked him about the OJ trial, which was going on at the time.  I don't care to give my opinion on that.  I don't think we should be talking about that.  And we said, all right, your show is Politically Incorrect.  Who around, Hollywood, Washington, do you think is being too politically correct about that?  But, please, do you got any better questions?  We're on the air.  Yeah.  And he's saying things like, do you got any better questions?  How long have you guys been doing this?  Wow.  It is, you know, two weeks.  But that wasn't the point at the time.  So we've hated this son of a bitch since then, and he hasn't worked his way into our good graces by what he's done in the past six years. 
[00:38:00]  He's a pompous buffoon who thinks he knows everything.  And this time he's put his foot firmly in his mouth.  Now, Michael, take pleasure in the fact that he will pay dearly for that.  Yeah, he needs to be dicky-batched very fast.  He will pay dearly for that.  Nor are rules.  Keep up the good work.  Because Anthony said it.  I mean, there are consequences, you know.  You've got to understand the consequences for some of the things you're saying. 
[00:38:30]  What he said, paraphrasing, pretty much that the terrorists are being called a cowardly act because of the killing of innocent people, not the way they carried it out.  Yes, you either got to be completely insane or the bravest son of a bitch in the world to kill yourself for a cause, regardless of if you agree with the cause or whatever.  I tend to believe more that they're fanatic lunatics that have been brainwashed more so than a heroic person that's doing something for good. 
[00:39:00]  I think heroism and bravery and courage is when it's for the good of people and you sacrifice yourself.  You make that sacrifice for the good of people.  When it's on the end of killing innocent people, then it is a cowardly act for the innocent people you're killing.  But I don't think anybody has read the news or looked and haven't thought, what a set of brass balls on these guys to do what they did.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  But then part two of his comment about our military and our pilots being cowardly because they launched cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away.  This mother effer knows nothing about the military and what it's like and the bravery that it takes to get in these planes, not knowing if you're going to come back 2,000 miles away.  Eat me.  You know, when you're bombing a country from even the most technologically advanced planes and ships, the danger is there all the time that you're not coming back. 
[00:40:00]  It's not cowardly.  And that's what that F is going to pay for.  You know what point that he missed is that, you know, he's saying that it was a certain amount of bravery staying on the planes when you knew they were going to hit buildings, you know, from the point of the terrorists.  But you know what else would stay on a plane knowing it was going to hit a building?  A chimpanzee.  Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  Dummies.  I would like to think, yeah, that it's because they are so brainwashed and their leaders get them whipped up into this frenzy where they can't even think normally. 
[00:40:30]  And that's why they do it, not out of this bravery.  And Bill Maher saying that about our military.  I could care less of what he says about terrorism.  It's all speculation, but whatever.  But then to turn around and say that our military, there's no bravery there because we've advanced to the point where we can fight war with as little civilian casualties as possible. 
[00:41:00]  It's a credit to the country and to what we've been able to do.  And this guy just uses it to call our military cowards.  Go in.  He's done.  Who's going to watch the show again?  Would you watch it?  I never did anyway.  I watched it once when Jay was on it.  Yeah, that's the only time I've watched it, when Jay Moore's been on it.  Put some more makeup on.  Whatever comes out of his mouth, he's just hoping to get the applause of the audience.  That's like his whole mission.  Now he's losing sponsors and it'll continue.  His true colors are coming out. 
[00:41:30]  Jack on.  All right.  Jeff Norris in the studio.  We're going to talk to him next.  All right.  See how he's doing.  We've got some more tribute songs that we've got to play.  Thank God.  I need them for inspiration.  Put your pins away, wannabe musicians.  Could you please?  Today, we upped the ante.  These are songs that we found that radio stations across America have been playing and they think  they're really good.  Sure.  They're not just the ones that we're getting. 
[00:42:00]  These are ones that have been endorsed by radio stations across America.  You know, these people ought to realize the only reason people aren't throwing your tapes  and CDs back at your face and going, you suck, is because everyone's been a little nicer lately.  But the truth of the matter is, you suck.  That's about it.  And Vinny from the Answer Feedback.  Opie, you idiot.  Don't you know to replace the STP desk with the porn DVD so no one knows what you have?  Oh.  I am an idiot.  That is like the easiest solution right there.  Thank you. 
[00:42:30]  Unless, of course, she wants to then use the STP CD while she drives a mother around, pops  it in, and you do pick up the audio tracks, right?  The DVD.  Well, do you really want to hear the director's cut on a porn with the director's commentary?  What I was looking for in a schlong during this part.  Jody was 11 and we had to stop because she kept crying through the day.  Me and Anthony.  I can't stop.  We can't let these people reproduce.  Obviously, no class. 
[00:43:00]  We need the toilets.  We'll never work this down again.  That's disgusting.  How do they let this on the air?  We suck.  Everyone hates us.  Child.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

Now, the station for sports guys on and my Opie and Anthony and Ron and Bez is this station.  1027 WNEW.  Who are you?  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:44:30]  If you're not in New York, give us a call at 866-277-4WOW.  On the front page of the Daily News here in New York.  It's probably in every paper in America today.  Sure.  The surveillance shot of one of the hijackers at the airport there in Maine.  You know what's so scary about this shot?  No.  It looks like any other businessman you would see on a plane.  Yeah, more or less.  It's got his nice little button shirt. 
[00:45:00]  That's what's so scary.  Because Jeff Norris is in the studio saying, you know, that you feel bad for what?  The towel heads in America?  You feel bad.  I was in this town by Lafayette Street today coming out of an audition.  There was a guy holding a sign that said I will only ride with an American cab driver.  Holding it up.  But it's, you know, and then cabbies are pulling over and they roll down.  They go, no, I ain't going with you.  And they go, you say I'm Indian.  And it's terrible. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, the Indians.  I'm not sure.  It's, and you know me, man.  They're starting to say some of those guys are going to fight, you know, side by side with us.  You know, we're going to have Christians and Jews and Muslims fighting side by side by side.  Yeah.  You know, and the point I want to make, and I think a lot of you guys have been educating yourselves about this whole thing.  What's scary is this guy is what's called a sleeper.  We've all heard that term in the last 10 days.  How are you going to pick him out and say that's the terrorist? 
[00:46:00]  You know, these guys are encouraged to, you know, to fit into our society.  It's against their religion to shave their face.  This guy is shaved to fit in.  You're not, you're not supposed to be wearing cologne if you're in, if you're one of these hardcore Muslims.  They're wearing the cologne.  They're drinking.  They're told to move into strip joints.  They're told to move into newer neighborhoods because people don't really know each other yet.  You know, that's what makes this whole damn thing so scary.  They're out there. 
[00:46:30]  We've got to keep tabs on who's coming into the country.  Well, regardless of what they do, if you see that guy coming into the country,  we've got to check out everyone that's coming in from overseas.  That's it.  You know what else they carry in the duffel bags?  This is true.  Cigarettes and porn magazines, like things that they think an American would carry.  Oh, there you go.  It's inaccurate, but they're told to do that.  Should you give them your duffel bag?  Yeah, really.  Well, I mean, a warning sign should have, you know, popped up with this guy,  obviously, if you've been doing some research.  But, you know, there's more of these guys out there. 
[00:47:00]  That's what scares them.  Well, they figured the CIA had a lead on a couple of these guys,  and it got passed off to the FBI and then to the INS.  See, these guys have learned from the skinheads.  Yeah.  You know, skinheads get into all sorts of crap, and, you know, they have that look.  You know, they shave their hair down and stuff.  And then, you know, law enforcement's like, hey, there's the skinheads.  We've got to look out for them.  See them with the skinheads.  How can you talk about Norton when he's right in front of you?  And then finally, you know, the skinheads, they woke up and said, wait a minute, 
[00:47:30]  we could grow our hair long, you know, fit in and still do the same crap that we want to do.  But, right, then it's called the clan.  Yeah.  Kind of takes away from the skinhead thing when you don't have a skinhead, right?  I just think they should take the turbans off in the city, at least for a while.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Take them off and just, you know.  I've noticed a few people now.  Out of respect, just take them off.  I've seen a lot of cabbies with turban heads because they have taken them off. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Have they really?  Yeah.  It's been on there for so long.  Like, oh, now we can't tell who you are.  I'll jump right in your cab.  The only thing they brought to this country is smell.  You're insane.  Smell.  Okay, terrific.  There's a lot of Arab Americans out there doing some good things.  No, I know.  You know, when I was watching, I saw the serious note.  Because every time all you idiots say that, I have to deal with the email.  No, on a serious note, seriously.  I really do.  No, I did feel that way.  I was saying I can't look at any of them. 
[00:48:30]  I don't blame you.  At first, after everything that went down, you wanted to, you know, do some damage to  everybody you saw on the street.  But then you've got to, you know, use your brain and realize that it's not every single  one of them out there.  Well, on CNN, they showed that St. Vincent's, and they had, I don't know if he was Arabian  or Indian, but he looked at it and sounded like it, and he was saving people.  And then I hung my head in shame.  I said, you can't judge and learn.  All right.  Very good.  I don't know.  You want to play some of these tribute songs, Adam?  Yeah, let's see what people are doing in other cities to try to make it better for the other 
[00:49:00]  people.  Well, you know, and we've got to set up all these bits nowadays, unfortunately, because  everyone is very sensitive out there.  You know, I understand, you know, these people, they're sending these songs into radio stations  and it's their way of expressing what they're feeling and expressing themselves.  And we understand all that crap, okay?  Yeah.  We think it's a bunch of crap.  You know, we're all very sad at what happened over a week ago, and I personally don't want 
[00:49:30]  to be any sadder than I have to be.  And these songs, there's only one purpose to it.  It's just making people even sadder.  Yeah.  Now, this is my opinion.  You don't have to agree with me.  I don't care.  Anthony and I said this years ago on our show.  We just throw this crap out there.  We're not expecting people to, you know, agree with us on this stuff.  But this is what we feel, okay?  Well, could you imagine if I called in with some tribute jokes?  People would want to lynch me. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  These songs are just, oh.  We played a bunch of these yesterday and, oh, people were hating them.  Are we getting the John Bellamy song in, too?  We're still waiting for it.  All right.  Rick, which one is this?  That's track number one, Monk, from, uh...  Oh, God.  What is this one?  All right.  Wait, get on, get on, Mike, Rick.  These songs are all over the Internet, and they're being played by pretty big air personalities.  Oh, really?  And radio stations all over America. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a show called...  There's a show called Monsters of the Midday in Florida.  Monsters of the Midday.  Yeah, they're out of Tampa.  TKS.  That's right.  I think we're going to be on in Tampa eventually.  Hey, how about that?  Following Monsters of the Midday.  I don't know if we'll be on their station.  I don't know.  Oh, fantastic, wonderful, what?  So, well, did they do this song themselves?  They did this song, yeah, and this is their big, uh, their big tribute song.  And these are all over the...  Huge in Tampa. 
[00:51:00]  These are all over the radio websites, and our business is like, hey, you've got to download  this song and play it on your show or your station.  I was...  It's getting quite a buzz in our city, Tampa, here.  I was talking last night with my girlfriend just saying I'm so disgusted with the business  of not just radio, but really radio has a lot to do with, but just the entertainment business.  Everything.  Everything is so just self-important, you know? 
[00:51:30]  And it's the same thing with these songs.  They throw them together, and you know that they're just meeting with each other, and...  Yeah, that's a good one.  You know, and the whole...  The whole original, uh, uh, cause that it was made for, which I don't think exists in  the first place, uh, just takes a backseat to, hey, if this gets played all over the  country, we're going to do great.  This is good for us.  Yeah.  Self-serving.  Oh, yeah.  Monsters of Midday.  So, what's the name of the song, Rick?  Do you know?  Um, I think it's called, uh, uh, Tuttle's or something. 
[00:52:00]  Tuttle's song for Bubba.  Uh, I don't know.  It's just scribbled on the CD.  Uh.  All right.  But it's their tribute song.  This is their tribute song.  All right.  Now, um, I just hope people aren't, like, tuning in in the middle of the song going,  oh, wow, look at that.  And, you know, they're doing something nice with these.  No.  No.  Monsters of Midday.  Flip it upside down when you're going.  Wow.  Hmm. 
[00:52:30]  Goodbye, English Rose.  Another one that sounds like that.  Didn't we hear this yesterday?  No?  It's the one that turns into the hip-hop thing.  You ripped through our city's skyline.  Uh-huh.  But you missed America.  You brought down our nation's airlines.  But you missed America.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[00:53:00]  You can go insane and kill and maim and set our flag aflame.  We don't live in America.  We don't live in America.  So you can't hurt us at all.  Wait, the problem is we do live in America. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we do.  See, what he's saying, Opie, is we don't live in America.  America.  America lives in us.  Yes.  Yes.  Don't live there because America lives in us. 
[00:54:00]  Ah, I see.  Middle of the song, applause break.  Come on.  It's a bad Billy Joel impression.  Yeah.  Now our nation stands united because you missed America.  We are brothers unbibited because you missed America.  You missed America.  He means the heart part. 
[00:54:30]  You can come on and tear our buildings down and burn them to the ground.  No, but we'd rather you don't.  Yeah, no.  You can't come here and do that, you idiot.  Was he just giving permission?  Yeah, I don't care what he says after that phrase.  You can't do that ever.  Tampa stinks.  Missed America.  Try to stay on the friggin' note, my friend.  What the hell is that?  Hold on, I want to hear this part again.  Come around and tear our buildings.  All right, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Wait, listen to the words.  Hold on. 
[00:55:00]  Hold on.  Hey, rhyme.  Say rhyme.  This took at least an hour to do it.  Shut up.  I hear next.  As you missed America.  Here we go.  Listen to this line.  You can come around and tear our buildings down and burn them to the ground.  Hey, thanks.  But we will never fall.  That's wonderful.  Sweet.  We don't live in America.  Oh. 
[00:55:30]  So you can't hurt us at all.  Oh, my God.  You could only hope the mic he was singing in was covered with herpes.  Every thumb lives in us.  Yes.  Spirits of feelings.  All right.  Well, there you go.  And he lives in a flat, mountainless dump.  There you go.  I hate Florida.  Wow.  We're the next guest on Politically Incorrect.  How embarrassing, though, to our business.  We don't live in America. 
[00:56:00]  America, you're the feeling of America.  Holy Christ.  Ken Stevens, please get us on in Tampa Bay.  I think that would be an easy market to win in.  If their listeners are sitting there going, oh, here it is, the song I was telling you about.  That was a monstrosity.  So the Monsters of Midday thing is pretty much that accurate.  Then again, if they were enjoying that, they would probably hate this radio program. 
[00:56:30]  Doug.  Come on.  That's legit.  I'd rather listen to Jeff Norris' Nightclub act in that.  You can tear our buildings down.  No, you can't tear our buildings down.  Please.  You should even play.  That's horrible.  All right.  That's awful.  It stinks.  They should rename their show Sissies of the Midday.  Yeah, Ikea boy wants to know if we had brought back the most offensive song contest and didn't tell anybody.  No. 
[00:57:00]  Peter.  Yo.  What's up?  Good God.  Are these guys serious?  How the hell could they even think to publish that?  Well, I don't know.  They're playing it.  Oh, my God.  That has got to be the worst thing I've ever heard in my whole life.  They're probably playing that song every other hour, if I know where you are.  Oh, I heard it once.  I just wanted to dry off the road and stand in the rain and be miserable.  Coming up in an hour, we're going to be playing America Lives in Us.  Oh, God.  You guys rule.  Take care.  All right.  We've got to give Ron and Fez credit. 
[00:57:30]  I heard them on the way home last night.  They were playing that song and said, we've got to leave that one for O&A.  You could tear our buildings down, but you missed America.  You can burn our cities down, but you missed America.  You missed America.  America, today, our country tis of thee, today, sweet land of liberty.  Geez, wow. 
[00:58:00]  Awful.  Neil picked up on that song right away.  Oh, my God.  Hey, our buddy, our pal, Scorch from the King.  Scorch, how you doing?  Kingdom Indigators.  That song sucks up here.  That song even sucks for Central New York.  Holy Christ.  Holy noon radio.  Holy noon.  What's up, guys?  Hey, how you doing, Scorch?  Hey, thanks for having me aboard again.  Nice to be here.  Well, listen, we had a problem with your fundraiser idea that you had for Friday or tomorrow.  Yeah.  The doggies.  You were going to collect dog food for the doggies?  Yeah, there's no need now.  I know.  I got a call from somebody that said, you guys are giving me a hard time. 
[00:58:30]  I have a hard time believing that.  No, we wouldn't mess with you.  Yeah, I would imagine so.  We're not on up there yet, right?  No, but you're probably going to be at some point soon.  All right, good.  Yeah, I am.  So, you have rethought your Friday show?  Well, I got something different to you.  Yeah, I'm starting a game that I figured out.  I'm calling it douche or dressing.  And I'm...  Hold on, hold on.  Give Ben a microphone for the Scorch segment, because Ben just loves this guy. 
[00:59:00]  Scorch rules.  Scorch rules.  I'm sorry, douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing.  I'm not going to be subtitled Seven Seas or Summer's Eve.  Ah, okay.  Because basically we're having people blindfolded, drink cups of Italian dressing or vinegar and water douche with a little bit of a regular in it.  And they have to decide if it's...  Douche or dressing.  But you know what?  For Central New York, it works.  And will you give out prizes for the person that guesses correctly?  No, man.  We don't give out prizes. 
[00:59:30]  There's no need to give out prizes.  So, what's up with your dog every time you call us?  I don't know.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Man, I still have my wolf that you guys knew I had, and I get a pit bull, so who knows to play it?  Scorch, let me play devil's advocate with your brand new bit, okay?  Yeah.  Douche or dressing.  Please.  How many people are you going to have doing this?  Ah, who knows?  Probably maybe 15 throughout the morning.  15 people throughout the morning, okay.  Don't you think after the first or second it's going to kind of get old real fast?  Ah, no.  Not if I change the douche and or the dressing, no.  Ah, there you go. 
[01:00:00]  So, what type of douche do they have besides the water?  Well, they've got vinegar and water.  I would imagine they have some sort of herbal douche, I think.  I would think, yeah.  You know?  Scorch, is douche poisonous to be ingested?  I don't.  Who cares?  You didn't look into the whole angle of maybe one of your people.  Who cares?  No, it's just seriously.  Who cares?  Dude, how many hits did you have when you came up with this brilliant idea?  That could have been, I think I was coming back from your studio, actually.  So, who knows?  I was with the stoners that day, so Lord only knows. 
[01:00:30]  I like douche or dressing, Opie.  What's your problem with it?  Can we steal the douche or dressing idea?  See, you know, let me, yeah, you can definitely steal that, but let me explain something.  You ask me all the time what I do on my show.  Your show is nationwide.  Am I going to tell you my stories so everybody nationwide can steal all of my fun things I do?  Hell no.  I have a feeling the monsters of the midday will be stealing douche or dressing.  That's pretty funny.  That was a god-awful tune.  I can send you one.  Let me find one.  This guy came into the station the other day and sang this song that was just so totally god-awful.  He put that one, makes that one sound like a Grammy winner. 
[01:01:00]  And were you live on the air when he was doing it, and you had to make believe it was good?  Well, I didn't make believe it was good.  Okay, good.  You know, but, yeah, I had to be live.  It was just awful.  What else do we got coming up tomorrow?  Tomorrow we got Kurt Angle and Steve Austin coming up because of the thing on Sunday.  Unforgive it.  Hold on.  Time out.  You're interviewing Steve Austin tomorrow?  Yeah.  Dude, we've been in New York for three years.  We've never gotten Steve Austin on our show.  I work with the WWF, though, so I can...  Ah, see?  That's...  Oh, there's the...  There's the... 
[01:01:30]  I think we got Shano Mack today.  That's cool, though.  He's a man.  He's a good man.  We like the Shano.  Yeah, Shano's a good man.  Other than that, really, not much.  We might do something with Gooner.  I don't know.  But, you know, Gooner came down to my version of Stinky.  Right.  And that's about it.  All right.  And douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing is the name of it.  The other one we're going to do...  How about this one?  Here's something else you all can steal, okay?  I can't wait to hear this one.  Go ahead.  This one is called The Weakest Dink.  The Weakest Dink?  The Weakest Dink.  It's got to be an Asian reference.  I have Ann Robinson doing some drafts me, and I've got women calling me up, telling me 
[01:02:00]  about their boyfriends that couldn't get it up, or their husbands, or whatever.  Oh.  And then we do the conference call and let them explain why they couldn't get it up, and  you know, we let the listeners vote who has The Weakest Dink.  And then we...  Actually, I'm sending the winner of this one, which I think I'm starting next week, to the  whorehouse in Las Vegas.  Totally nude.  Totally nude whorehouse in Las Vegas.  Scorch, I got some different douche flavors, I guess you'd call them.  You do.  Which you would call them, but yeah, Summer's Eve puts out some of these flavors. 
[01:02:30]  They're legitimate, so this might help you with your bit.  Thank you.  Lemon mist.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking you get some lemon mist douche, and maybe lemonade.  Yeah.  Something like that, okay?  Okay.  The vinegar and water, so you can do that with the dressing.  Yeah.  There's white flowers.  Oh, yeah.  Is something.  Now, I don't know what you would be able to use with the white flowers.  You're going to do this.  Oh, my goodness, guys.  That's funny.  White flowers. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know what you could use for that.  Do you know there's a...  Do you know there's a post-menstrual douche, Opie?  No, really.  I never knew that.  Really?  Like, I didn't know that that had to be kept clean.  But there you go.  The lemon mist and lemonade.  That could help you.  I could.  Thanks, man.  You're the man.  Scorch, hold on a second, because Tara's really pissed off.  Tara?  Yes.  What's up?  About a week ago, I was listening to YSP in Philly.  Yeah.  And Cousin Ed played that song. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, no.  But it wasn't the song.  Some woman wrote an email and was circulating it around the Internet.  So those guys didn't even write it.  It's the exact same words.  Oh, so some lady wrote that as maybe a cute little poem or something.  It was supposed to be like...  And then the Monsters of the Midday put it to music.  Monsters of the Midday.  Yeah, she was calling in...  America!  She was calling in an open letter to the terrorists.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think they're going to read it. 
[01:04:00]  All right, Tara.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I love open letters to people.  You only make open letters to people that are never, ever going to read the open letter.  Why do people in a time of tragedy have to show everybody how brilliant and deep they are?  Nobody cares.  That's my point.  You know what the other thing radio stations across America are doing?  They're...  Look, all right.  I know your intentions were nice and stuff.  But they're getting, like, giant cards.  Pop Tots?  Oh, cards.  Cards.  And having, like, their whole community sign in and say how sorry they are. 
[01:04:30]  There you go.  They are.  Where's that going to go?  And they're going to, you know, bring it down to, like, Washington Square Park or Union Square Park.  That's great.  So we could all read the card.  Beats get having money.  You know, don't donate money.  Get the big card.  What the hell is the big card going to do?  You know, let me put a little taste of reality into that whole thing.  Where do you think all those books are that people sign for Lady Vi?  In the trash.  In the trash.  Who's reading those?  What would have made the people feel good to write down their thoughts, Anthony?  Write them down and keep them on your table at home. 
[01:05:00]  Read them for your own inspiration.  Scorch, we've got to get back to our show.  Well, thank you for having me on.  I appreciate it.  Choose your dressing.  Hey, let me, can I give a quick plug to two things?  And I promise you it'll be very quick.  Scorchandkrock.com.  But starting a week from next, it's Scorch1.com.  And we've got our own website coming up.  You've got your own?  Wait a minute.  This is exciting news.  Scorch1, just the number one, or do you spell it?  Scorch1.com.  Who the hell has Scorch.com?  Actually, a company out of Canada has Scorch.com. 
[01:05:30]  Sons of bitches.  Sons of bitches.  They're not even nude, and they're using Scorch.  Bastards.  Bastards.  Sons of bitches.  Do they sell douche or dressing?  That would be a coincidence and a half, wouldn't it?  It certainly would.  Scorch1.com.  When can we look forward to seeing Scorch1.com?  That should be up by October 1st.  And one more thing.  Tomorrow, Sunday's my birthday.  So, I want everybody to email me up to the radio station and say happy birthday.  Sunday.  Happy totally nude birthday.  Hey, Scorch, man.  You're coming up with those great ideas.  The week is dink and douche or dressing. 
[01:06:00]  Pittsburgh should be calling soon.  Pittsburgh, thanks.  Oh, you suck on me.  I love you guys.  Thanks.  Bye, Scorch.  Bye.  Good job, boys.  Scorch from the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Totally nude radio.  Totally nude.  Dude, dude, dude.  Bye, Scorch.  Bye, guys.  We love that.  Douche or dressing.  Yeah, I just pictured him.  Hey, we ride him hard, but just think of this.  He's syndicated through our show.  Here's what I picture.  Here's what I picture.  15 cities just heard him.  Yes.  Scorch laying in bed. 
[01:06:30]  He's been up all night.  It's maybe 2 a.m.  Pitch black.  Then bolts up.  I don't know.  It sits straight up. 
[01:07:00]  Douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing.  I'll write that down.  All right.  Just bolts straight up.  Douche or dressing.  Just yells it out in the darkness.  I have a feeling he has a tape recorder by his bed like Keith Richards.  He's not going to remember these ideas when he wakes up.  I think I woke up in the middle of the night with an idea.  I'm not sure, though.  Thank God I have this new cassette recorder.  Let me just hit play here. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, Scorch.  It's me, Scorch.  You were just asleep, but now you're awake.  I'm not sure you're going to remember this.  Douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing.  Oh, wait.  I fell asleep.  Let me hit off.  Douche or dressing.  The guy's a goddamn genius.  We love this, Scorch.  There's tragedy and turmoil everywhere.  Douche or dressing.  Okay.  Do they really have lemonade-flavored douche?  Were you joking?  Lemon, yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Lemon mist.  It's always got to be something nice.  Something crisp and clean.  You guys, we still have four...  Country waterfall.  We still have four songs to play.  Putting the accent on country.  Country waterfall.  I said conch.  I know.  The lemonade one is nice.  You apply it and then you lay back and you charge five cents a lick.  Hot summer day.  Let the kids build a stand.  I don't know what that means, yeah?  Sure. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  We'll see what happens.  We got four more tribute songs to get to him.  Did we find the new John Valby song?  Not yet.  John's got some weird internet problems.  Valby, he can't figure out how to email us the song again.  You've been emailing me for days.  All right.  More really bad tribute songs on the way.  Oopie.  Oh!  Oh, God damn it!  No! 
[01:09:00]  Oh!  No!  Son of a bitch!  No!  Oh, God damn it!  No!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  O.P.  And Anthony.  I'm a mental case.  Yeah.  Anthony, WWF.  Suppositories are peanut M&Ms.  It's a great idea. 
[01:09:30]  Maybe.  Yeah.  Last Monday on Raw, Kurt Angle drove Stone Cold Steve Austin right to the edge.  Can Stone Cold beat the Olympic hero?  The Rattlesnake will do anything to foil Kurt's attempt to capture the WWF championship.  Tune in to WWF Smackdown tonight at 8 on UPN.  It took Stephanie McMahon, Hemsley, Tess, Shane McMahon, and Booker T to bring down The Rock on Raw.  How will the WCW champion, The Rock, deal with the Alliance on Smackdown tonight?  Plus, the seven-time tag team champs, Edge and Christian, have now gone their separate ways.  Christian believes whatever Edge can do, he can do better than doing that old gag like Bugs Bunny. 
[01:10:00]  Whatever a Robert to do, Bruno do better.  Remember that one?  Jesus.  How can they take this family feud to a whole new level?  Tonight on Smackdown, WWF, Unforgiven.  Just three days before Unforgiven, will Stone Cold Steve Austin be hell-bent on revenge?  You know all the storylines.  It's great.  Check it out on UPN.  It's WWF Smackdown tonight at 8.  Come on and kick me. 
[01:10:30]  I've got my eyes wide.  I've got my big cheese.  I've got my hash pipe in America.  I've got my hash pipe.  I've got my hash pipe today.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Neil's got us a hash pipe, I think.  It's that way. 
[01:11:00]  Anthony, we have an update on Operation Infinite Beer.  Oh, thank God.  Our own war we're waging against thirst.  All we're trying to do is get a few kegs from Sam Adams down to Ground Zero.  To the emergency workers down there working hard to get done with their shift.  They want to drink some beer.  And we're going to give them some.  This all started with Psycho Mark saying a bar was running out of beer.  We're like, well, this is the least we could do is make sure the fire guys and everyone  else down there, the policemen and the FBI and whoever else has free beer to drink, right? 
[01:11:30]  Exactly.  Earl went down earlier with all the kegs of beer and he had no luck.  And he was turned away by many different police organizations, federal, state, and local  authorities, told him he could not bring the van full of kegs of beer into the disaster area.  And Psycho Mark thinks it's a piece of cake to get through the FBI.  Mark told Earl, calling him a jerk, and what are you doing?  Just tell him you know Psycho Mark and he'll get down there. 
[01:12:00]  Psycho Mark at this point, I think, thinks he's running the whole show down there.  Imagine how quickly you get thrown in jail for driving a van down there and saying,  I know Psycho Mark.  All right, all right, clear the area.  He said something about he's a psycho.  Well, that's Earl.  Hey, Earl, what's up?  How you doing?  This show stinks.  That sounded like Lisa Orban talking.  Yeah.  This show has no flow. 
[01:12:30]  We just spent five minutes setting up a bit and there's nothing there.  Well, you know, the phones are kind of difficult down there in that area.  Maybe they're, uh...  We stink.  Maybe...  I listen to all the shows.  They set up their bits nicely and they go to it and then the guy talks and then they  have a nice wrapped up bit.  All wrapped up in a nice little package.  A little package.  They also have songs like we heard in the last segment.  Oh, yeah.  That's true, too.  Well, I will say that last call is the most interesting I've heard, Earl, in a long time. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Here's Earl.  I'm assuming, Earl, you have some great news.  We got the kegs down to ground zero.  We have...  We're nowhere near it.  What?  Well, I'm sorry.  There's two things going on.  One.  All right.  We're at a stop now.  Right on the corner of Franklin at six.  And what's happening?  Is there any...  Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  You're live in 15 cities.  Can you help us out and talk a little bit?  I'm sorry.  I'm at a stop point.  You're what? 
[01:13:30]  Hey.  Okay.  Calm down.  Take a breath, Opie.  Because we need those phones for later.  You can't smash them.  Earl.  Yes.  Walk us through what is happening right now to you.  Where are you?  We're at a stop point right now.  I'm sorry.  I had three sets of cops talking to me at once.  Where exactly are you?  What happened to me doing?  Where exactly are you?  We just left.  They pushed us back off onto, like... 
[01:14:00]  I don't even know where we are.  We're on a canal in Baxter.  Okay.  They made us spin all the way around.  Now, what is your plan now to get that beer through those lines?  I haven't the foggiest idea at this point.  All right.  Would you maybe take one...  Think about it.  We're following the plan of a total drone.  Well, take one of Psycho Mark's suggestions.  What you got to do is park the van, lock it up, walk to the line, and tell them what you're doing.  Thank God.  Psycho Mark's on line six. 
[01:14:30]  With big, giant, metallic objects with no identification, no authorization.  Could you just make sure that my grave is kept clean when they shoot me?  Oh, stop, man.  Unbelievable.  Oh, he just hung up.  Earl just hung up, Mark.  He's got...  He could throw himself in the Hudson River by this point after trying that hard.  The problem with Earl is he has no motivation.  Now, this is very hard to do. 
[01:15:00]  I understand how hard this is to do.  But he has to overcome this and drive those kegs into the area where the people need to be in.  Can we call Earl back?  Hey, Earl.  I got a van.  I got a van full of beer for the kids.  Mark, you know where Earl is?  Yeah, he's down at Canal Street.  How close to you?  I'm, unfortunately, at Liberty Street and Broadway.  Oh, wait.  He only got as far as Canal Street?  That's like the first checkpoint, right? 
[01:15:30]  I think that area is open up to the public and he can't even get in there.  You're in the zone.  You're in the zone.  Like, he'll be able to get to those bars, no problem.  Are those bars open for business?  You bet.  So, how come he can't just drive there like he was going to the bar and then give them beer?  He can't even get where people can go, where it's open.  Oh, just the reservations of the Tribeca Grand or something.  They kicked him out of an open there. 
[01:16:00]  He's in Bayonne handing out stickers.  All right, hold on.  Earl's calling back.  Let's all be nice and at least...  All right, I'll be nice.  No, he's gone.  Because he just heard what you were saying.  I think he's having a bad time.  No, no, no.  He didn't...  He just shut off his cell phone.  So, you call him and it goes right into his voicemail.  So, now he's refusing to talk to us.  Oh, my God.  All right, we wasted enough time on Operation Infinite Beer for this hour.  First of all, Mark is right.  You can get down there.  I mean, I did it.  You can.  I was thinking he did it last night, too.  It's just, you know...  I was just down there. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, it's not that hard.  I was just there.  All you need one...  One...  Go ahead.  All right, hold on.  Earl's calling back.  Let's see.  And there's no way of getting in there.  Hold on.  Earl.  Hello?  Hey, Earl.  What's up?  I am on the...  I don't know where we are, but I'm standing in front of a state...  A fine state trooper and a fine New York City police officer.  They just told us we cannot get any...  We can't get through.  There's traffic for miles.  I hear them coming back to the radio.  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They have to go... 
[01:17:00]  Themselves.  Hold on, Earl.  Hold on.  Can we talk to the NYPD?  Peel a banana.  Earl.  Yeah.  Can we talk to the NYPD?  They refuse to talk.  I'm not going to talk to you guys on the phone.  Exactly.  Well, you've told them what your mission is?  Earl, aren't we trying to get this beer to a bar that is open to the public?  I don't know.  You make the right on bow.  What are they telling you now? 
[01:17:30]  We as well.  Earl, what are they telling you?  Loop around.  It's really bad.  We're going to have to go all the way down and loop around.  Maybe.  Whatever it takes.  Then do everything you're waiting for.  What, Earl?  We're going back.  Screw this.  No.  They're not going back.  They're bringing the beer down.  They need the beer.  You've got to go loop around.  We're going to get him and match beer?  Loop around.  Loop around.  Shoot him right now.  Shoot him now.  Kick him out.  They said loop around.  Loop around. 
[01:18:00]  Breaker breaker for the bandit.  Put the pedal to the metal.  We got smokies.  You are so stupid.  I'm going to take you and talk to you in the head.  All right.  Earl, you're still in the line.  Earl.  Earl?  He's playing the silence.  A dereliction of duty.  Shoot him right there in the line.  I think we've lost Earl.  No, he's there because the phone didn't hang up.  Earl.  You know, Earl's got to understand, though, that he has to go above and beyond.  If it means looping around somewhere, he's got to loop around.  You're a looper. 
[01:18:30]  You're an expediter.  He's got to do that.  If the cops tell him he's got to go somewhere else, he's got to go somewhere else.  Again, just run back here with all the beer.  What's he doing?  And before he goes...  This is a driver.  Earl.  Earl.  I know you're there.  Your phone didn't hang up.  Somebody can say, hey.  All right, Mark.  Your phone.  All right, Mark.  Your phone.  Can't he just carry and travel by tree limb?  Oh, man.  All right.  I just hung up.  That's the latest on Operation...  What?  I don't think it's working.  Don't say that crap. 
[01:19:00]  I didn't say that.  Operation Infinite Beer.  I don't think it's working.  No.  What happened?  Anthony's ex-mother-in-law would have got the beer there.  I would have gotten a box of wine.  Three rights.  Three rights make a left, Earl.  That's all you've got to remember.  Three rights make a left.  And if I was there, I would make sure the firefighters got boxes of wine so they could enjoy it. 
[01:19:30]  Maybe some grandma.  Yay.  But, Earl, if you're listening to me, take the van and make three rights because that's a left-hand tune.  Everybody knows three rights make a left.  Earl wants to go home.  Earl wants to go home.  But he can't.  He's got a mission to accomplish. 
[01:20:00]  I don't understand why he can't deliver the beer.  He ought to be able to all come up and drive boxes of wine across the line for the firemen.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, can we get back to the tribute songs?  God, yes, please.  Rick is busy downloading more, Anthony. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, there's billions of these.  Put one with a lot of meaning.  Sorry.  This is one that was sent to us called American.  American.  American.  By my fine friend, Phil.  Oh, he copyrights a song.  Thank God.  Is that what's happening?  Are there senators down there touring the zone?  No, I think they're back in Washington.  I don't think they're going to have an easy time getting down there. 
[01:21:00]  Is this Earl calling back?  Hold on a second.  No.  Wonder.  Okay.  So here's another bad tribute song, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  It's called American.  Okay.  Together we stand  This unite land  Shoulder to shoulder, now we stand  Act, act, act as one  What a sickening sight  In the broadest daylight 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yeah!  Sweet, magical crap!  You never rhyme with the same word  And just that line  In the broadest daylight  What a creep  The broadest daylight  Hey, man, maybe it'll get better. Relax.  A day I wish I never wanted  To forget  What? Hold on. 
[01:22:00]  A day I wish I never wanted  To forget  What the hell did he just say?  I wish that I never wanted  To forget  Don't make me rewind  Don't make me rewind  I wish I didn't have to  Want to forget  This day  Is what he's saying  Poetically  Don't make me rewind  Let's move forward  Can you explain it to me, please?  Think this will bring us to our knees?  We need some cheese  A sleeping giant is awake  And wants to run on the fight 
[01:22:30]  Act like fish you can't defend  Who's that? Who's that? Who's that?  What kind of message does he send?  Innocent lies are not a way  To prove you're right  Prepare for a fight  You asked for it right  You asked for it right  You got it coming  And there's nowhere you can hide  Shut up 
[01:23:00]  As long as it takes  Takes  Takes  The effort will make  Oh, man  Why doesn't he rhyme something  With stinks?  I used to hand in stuff like this  To my third grade teacher  And she would openly laugh at me  That's awful  This is some really bad stuff  Southern man  The stuff  I love when he says the first line  Because then  I'm trying to guess  What he rhymes it with 
[01:23:30]  And no matter how ridiculous  I come up with a word  His is even worse  All right, we can play that  We'll try to guess  What he rhymes it with  Oh, good  Whenever you say something backwards  For the sake of a rhyme  Like an effort will make  Right  Or awful  Yeah, yeah  Here we go, here we go  So peace and quiet  Can't sustain us all the time  Okay, ready to stop it  For the love of God  You must admit  Okay, the S word  No  Yeah, I can say that  We're going to go and beat their

[01:30:30]  And we're back with the  Opie and Anthony show  Obviously  Doors  Deuxer dressing  Duxer dressing  Duxer dressing  Duxer dressing  Duxer dressing  Duxer dressing  What would they do  Duxer dressing  Polystone radio  Duxer dressing  All right, I got an idea, guys.  These are just...  Shane McMahon calling in real soon.  Oh, yeah?  More tribute songs.  Maybe we can sneak one in before he calls. 
[01:31:00]  Also, the latest on Ground Zero, the mayor just had a press conference.  The number of missing just going up again.  For the last few days, it was 5,400 missing.  Yeah.  Well, they have that total, casually, another 900 people.  I don't understand how the missing toll goes up over a week after this happens. 
[01:31:30]  Like, who didn't notice that 900 people were missing for a week?  Well, over a week.  Like, I would think the missing total would pretty much stay the same.  But if it's someone close to you, it's not your first thing to, you know, fill a missing persons report or whatever.  What do you mean?  I think that's how they're keeping track of this.  By missing person reports.  I think.  I don't know.  Maybe someone could explain this.  But it's a casual...  We'll get 500 different answers, none of which will be right, so...  All right.  But it just casually went up 900. 
[01:32:00]  So, instead of 5,400 missing, now the mayor's saying 6,300 missing.  Jesus.  And he also announced that 6,200 injured from the attack.  Unbelievable.  Mm-hmm.  So, well, hopefully we'll do something soon.  Doesn't look like it, though.  Doesn't look like it.  I heard some stuff that I didn't like this afternoon.  I was listening to someone giving a speech.  I lost track of who all these people are, anyway.  Talking about how we got to be patient again. 
[01:32:30]  And that this is a battle that has to be fought on many different fronts.  I understand all that stuff, but it's almost sounding like...  Don't expect us to go in there and bomb the hell out of people.  You know?  Because we're going to be doing other things.  And I hope that's not true.  I hope it's not like the war on drugs, you know?  Here's the war work, but it's not really a war and it's not working.  So, I hope we go in and bomb somebody quickly. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Well, anything else pops from what's going on, we'll surely let you know.  So, let's move on with the show with Uncle John.  What's up, Uncle John?  Gee, what I have now doesn't seem so funny.  Well, you know what?  We've got to move back to the chuckles.  I mean, we're trying to do a little bit of a distraction for everybody.  Gotcha.  Well, what I had, guys, I wrote a real quick song that's going to take about 10 seconds  that talks about all these people writing songs.  Okay.  And basically it says, if you write a song about this tragedy,  we should hang you from a friggin' tree. 
[01:33:30]  La, la, la, la, la, la.  And that's it.  See you guys.  I like it.  All right, Uncle John.  The songs are so bad.  Well, where's Rick?  Where's our next song?  Where's the next victim?  We need another song.  What's this called, Ben?  Spirit of America, Washington, D.C.  Spirit of America, Washington, D.C.  It's from D.C.?  I guess that's where it's from, yeah.  Spirit of America.  Man, let's see if we can, hopefully we can play the same game.  Is this one that is being played all over the country?  Rick, what's the history of this song? 
[01:34:00]  Which one?  Spirit of America, Washington, D.C.  Yeah, this is an original out of Washington, D.C.  A bunch of local musicians got together, a la We Are the World.  Basically, yeah.  Oh, my God.  JFK's not playing.  We are the world.  Huh?  JFK's not playing this, right?  They will right now.  Hey, I don't care who's playing it.  If it's bad, it's bad.  It might be good.  It might be.  Who's to say, Dan?  All right, it's the spirit of America.  These stars and stripes we wear are more than just symbols. 
[01:34:30]  They embody every dream that every American has ever known.  Absolutely.  So look upon these faces of ours and know this now forever.  These hearts you break, these lives you take, our will is made of stone.  That's it.  Private Pile.  In a land of liberty, freedom reigns supreme.  All right, hit it. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, God damn it.  What's the problem, Rick?  Hold on.  It's not on CD.  Yeah, go back.  Hold on.  Go back to that thing right there, that little thing.  Right, okay.  Go.  Nice.  In a land of liberty.  No, no.  No!  Rick, you're ruining the game.  It's the game, uh...  Rick.  Stop!  Stop!  You guys are driving me nuts today.  Rick.  I'm giving the international sign for the cue, you know, where you put your finger up in 
[01:35:30]  the air and you're usually, okay, right here.  Right.  I didn't go right here.  I know.  I was still up here.  I saw this.  No, I'm up here.  You wait for it.  I'm down here.  Right.  International sign of cue.  Keep it going.  Then the finger goes down, you stop.  Exactly.  That is true, Rick.  Huh.  All right.  Let's see if we can regroup here and try this again.  Go ahead.  Play the tune.  In a land of liberty, freedom reigns supreme. 
[01:36:00]  There you go.  So the word we're working on is supreme.  We're doing the writing game again?  Yeah, yeah.  Redeem.  Redeem.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  A face full of cream.  No, it's not a porno song, Norton.  Redeem.  Dream.  Dream.  Dream.  Big Kev.  Nice call.  I'm going with Big Kev and dream.  Redeem or dream.  Oh, wait.  What was the line again?  We live free or something? 
[01:36:30]  Redeem.  I'm not listening.  I don't care because it never makes sense when you're taking the context of a song.  All right.  So what are we going with?  I'm going with dream.  Okay.  Redeem.  We're red and white and blue and black and yellow meld like rain.  What?  It's the only...  Rain.  Like rain?  There's no rhyme.  Oh, you can't do it with a damn song that doesn't rhyme.  You know what?  Play a little bit of it so we get the gist of how it's structured.  Let's get a little vibe here. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  Let's go.  Let's see how it's structured.  The power that defines our people has a name.  America.  Monotony.  Monotony.  They can try to burn our flags and shake our soul.  All right.  The fabric that we're made of is just wrong. 
[01:37:30]  They can top a hundred-story buildings to the ground.  Yeah.  The records skip and hit it.  That's all you say?  They can?  They can?  We have lost our fellow brothers throughout the years.  And the times it seems when we make the side again.  No!  Like a million stars that glows for all the world to see. 
[01:38:00]  V.D.  V.D.  We have lost our hearts like that I shake your name.  And we'll see.  See, he rhymed it that time.  This is so bad.  It's droning.  It's like a...  It's like a...  I picture this going through the heads of the soldiers during the Baton Death March.  And they're playing that song...  Do you hear that?  They're playing that song all over Washington.  I'll be honest.  I don't think that one stinks. 
[01:38:30]  I'm not crazy for it, but I don't hate it.  Dude, it's blank.  That's hard.  It wasn't as predictable, though, as the other ones.  Well, I'll give them an A on unpredictability.  But here's something.  Finish a sentence.  You've got to finish your sentence.  I'll agree with that.  I'll agree in, you know, certain ways.  Run-on sentences never go.  I'll say equally stinks.  But in a different way.  I don't like that one.  I can't go with that, although I can understand why you don't say...  I think that was the best at all. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God, you guys.  No, but if they're all bad, you've got to have one good one.  No.  No.  Tom.  It's like the difference between dog crap and cat crap.  Hold on, hold on.  Okay.  Cat crap's lower.  One will taste better.  Both awful.  But one will slide down the palate a little easier.  Every fancy piece.  Oh, God.  All right, Tom from the NYPD.  What's up?  I'm not from NYPD.  I'm from about 40 minutes out of there.  What it is is you can enter a person missing any police station in the United States.  And what's happening is, like, I entered three people today into the NCIC computer. 
[01:39:30]  People have, like, gotten into New York, went to the armory.  You can't report them missing there.  They went to another place looking for hope to find their people.  You can't report them there.  They have to make it to a police station or now, which was set up today, Liberty State Park has a terminal there.  Okay.  So, like, I entered two people that are missing from my community.  I'm 40 minutes south in Jersey.  Right.  All right.  So that number's going to go ran up. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, it will.  Actually, there's stuff that we were reading about a week ago that already said the number's going to fly.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem, man.  Good luck.  All right.  Well, that's not good news.  Little answer there.  None of this is good news, honestly.  West Coast Dave, this is awful.  The worst yet.  Yeah.  I don't understand why you two guys are giving that guy some props.  Look, that song sucks.  I didn't give it a damn thing.  It was so monotonous and droning.  It just gives you that uncomfortable feeling because you don't know when the sentence is going to end. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I like that when they throw me a little zinger that I'm not looking for.  Zinger.  I like that occasionally.  Here comes the rhyme.  Oh, it's not a rhyme.  You can't pull those kind of shenanigans when you're writing these songs.  Yeah, for the love of Eve.  Let's just simmer down in here.  All right.  Eddie, what's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you doing?  I think you guys should be smashing that album like Opie does to Stalker.  Eddie, trust me.  I would love to, but it's on a huge machine because it's not on CD. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  I would destroy a $5,000 piece of equipment.  I am capable of doing that.  Yes.  I believe it.  I believe it.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you.  You guys are fantastic.  Thank you.  All right.  Rick, do we have one more tribute song before we take a break  and then get to Shane McMahon who's waiting on the phone line?  We do have more, but there's another part of the song you guys got to hear.  Oh, really?  It just goes really bad.  It goes bad?  What do you mean it goes bad?  I agree with it.  I was enjoying that one a little bit. 
[01:41:30]  I'm glad that somebody, albeit uncircumcised and gay, is on my side.  Sorry.  Don't throw things.  Rick is a big boy.  Go ahead, Rick.  You can choose to fight this man. 
[01:42:00]  Or you can choose to understand the spirit of America.  I can't believe you guys like this.  I withdraw my statement.  Boy, we...  No, it doesn't get any worse.  I amend my statement.  Horrendous.  The news clip took that from I could tolerate it to I now concur. 
[01:42:30]  It stinks.  Awful.  It stinks.  The news clips did it for me.  Are you related to Helen Keller?  No.  What's wrong with your ears?  I wasn't...  I wouldn't say I was enjoying that.  It's just making your bell.  You said it wasn't that bad.  Compared to all the other ones.  No.  There's no comparing.  It's so utterly bad.  That's like saying, you know, you're talking about Dog Ass.  It did a little bit sound like a mutual fun commercial.  It's still Dog Ass.  I was waiting for the pa-rum-pa-pum-pum-pum. 
[01:43:00]  I actually like that song very much for you.  It's a fine Christmas song.  Oh, my God.  It is.  It's a fine number for the holidays.  I'm sure Shane O'Mac is a busy man.  Shane.  We can't make him wait for the commercials.  Shane.  Shane.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I'm doing okay.  How are you guys doing?  Hanging in.  Hanging in.  You know, we're moving on a little bit.  We spent a week, last week, really getting into it.  But a lot of people want us to get a little bit back to some normal shows that we've done. 
[01:43:30]  That's what we're trying to do also.  Yeah, we noticed that.  I so enjoyed some of the speeches that some of the superstars gave.  We played some of them here on our show.  You really separate the people that can think for themselves and the people that should maybe just keep their mouths shut.  Your dad's speech was great.  It was great, yeah.  Well, again, all those were set up with you put a camera in a room and everyone that wanted to participate and have their voice heard. 
[01:44:00]  We said, okay, yeah, we just lay it down.  So it was not written for them or anything like that.  So they just went in there and spoke from the heart.  It was raw.  Absolutely.  Get it?  Your dad was great.  I pictured him standing in front of a crowd at Nuremberg.  He should be a general.  He really should.  The guy really rallied the truth.  But then I got to call your sister out on this one. 
[01:44:30]  Okay.  Stephanie gets up and she starts trying to draw a parallel between your family's, the allegations about the steroid stuff.  I guess that's what it was about that she was hitting on that happened years ago.  A bunch of people coming down on your family and the attack.  And we were sitting here listening to her thinking maybe, maybe some of the solution in the implants were leaking out and going into her brain.  It was getting a little rough to listen to. 
[01:45:00]  If she wasn't so goddamn hot, Shane, we really would have tore her up.  That sister is looking so damn good these days.  What do you think about her new chest?  I have no comment.  You don't.  I have no comment.  I have no comment.  The big brother's always got to step in and defend the sister.  I take the fifth on that one.  But I'll tell you.  I'll comment on those.  Those are some beautiful cans that Stephanie's got these days.  Yeah, you think she went too small? 
[01:45:30]  No.  Yeah, what was the deal with that, Shane?  Hey, man, you've got to ask her.  They've got lives of their own.  They are.  They're great.  She's trying to tell us, well, they're still swollen.  They'll come down a little bit.  Has she told you anything about the ritual that girls that get implants have to go through on a daily basis?  No.  Again, I stay way, way away from it.  Shane, there's a whole thing of massaging.  Oh, yeah.  And like you oil up the hands and you have to massage them on a daily basis. 
[01:46:00]  That's so the swelling won't go down.  That's a beautiful thing, right?  So they'll set nice.  It's so beautiful.  So it sets nice like cement.  That's great.  You look at some old pictures.  I swear to God.  You look at when she first hit the scene, chained up in that boiler room with the undertaker after her.  And look at her now.  Two different people.  What can you do?  Yeah, it might be a little uncomfortable.  I'm at a loss for words.  I got you.  That could be one of your guys' new jobs, though.  You know, you can get into the whole massaging of any woman that has the implants. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, they can just come by and you guys would just do that little for a couple hours.  Yeah.  Hey, Shane, guess who's our new pal on the show?  I'm guessing.  Jerry the King Lawler.  Oh, really?  We've talked to the King a couple of times.  Last time we spoke with him, he was still pretty broken up about the cat.  Do you guys secretly just gig your ass off about what a tool he is for doing what he did?  No.  Because we do it here. 
[01:47:00]  I would just hope that at some point he does.  You should tell everyone.  You know, maybe there's some wrestling fans that don't really know or some French wrestling fans.  Quickly, Jerry the King Lawler was one of the announcers for the WWF.  Very good.  He has quite the personality.  He's perfect for it, if you ask me.  He had a girlfriend, the cat, that was also in WWF.  And she got fired.  Which was a good move.  His wife.  Right.  It was his wife.  Good move by the WWF because she didn't really add much.  So she got fired. 
[01:47:30]  The King, after being with the WWF for years, decides he's going to stand by his woman.  Says, if she's fired, I go.  Right.  And they told him, you know, okay, good luck with your life and let him go.  This past July, the cat left the King.  After sticking up for her, she ditches him.  So now he doesn't have a job or the chick.  And she's got a restraining order.  And the restraining order, when he was out of town, she went to the house of cops and cleaned him out.  It's such a sad story.  And then he's spilling his heart out to her on a website. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  I didn't hear about the restraining order.  Oh, yeah.  That's the latest.  Oh, yeah.  Did you read some of the website stuff?  No.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm hoping, you know, someday we can be together as friends.  Meanwhile, who hasn't seen the picture of her sucking on that big Johnson?  It's so harsh.  It is so harsh.  Shane, I got to ask you, though.  Where is this?  Is that we've seen pictures.  You haven't seen that picture yet?  We'll see.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Is that really her?  Oh, yeah.  I just picture it.  To the best of our ability, it's her.  Yeah.  So, Shane, I just want to know, is there any way possible?  Possibly, you guys would consider having him back.  Yeah.  We need to try to get him.  Hey, well, again, anything can happen in the North Wrestling Federation.  Okay.  Anything can happen.  No.  And the King is a great talent.  He really is.  I like the way him and J.R. would play off of each other.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  He was kind of the real goof factor there.  Nothing, you know, we don't want to take anything away from Paul, but, man, and Jim 
[01:49:00]  Ross and the King, they were a great combo.  Yeah, King is very quick-witted.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, King, look at a naked picture of his cat giving a Hummer.  You know, I just want to see stuff like that.  That brings a whole new meaning to the word slobberknocker.  Slobberknocker!  King, do you have any pride?  Unbelievable.  I'm just wondering if there's any chance that he would come back.  Has he talked to you guys?  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Does he leave these meetings feeling good? 
[01:49:30]  Relatively as good as he can feel.  I don't know how that is.  Boy, what a...  How many times, though, I think at one point in our lives we've all been raked over by a  chick, but to have it so public and to have him having gone out on a limb like that for  him to just be hosed, it's one of those horrible, horrible situations that you just laugh at  because you're so glad it's not you.  Exactly.  All right.  He doesn't want to talk about it. 
[01:50:00]  I understand.  So what do we got going on, Shane?  We've got lots of things going on.  I've got to be honest.  I haven't watched wrestling in a while because I've been kind of busy watching this around  the clock coverage of other things, but I'm looking for a distraction, so...  Well, you can check out tonight, then, if you're looking for a distraction.  Yeah.  What's going on tonight on SmackDown?  Of course, you've got SmackDown.  Well, as everyone knows, we're going this Sunday pay-per-view, and hopefully, once again,  our whole mission and goal is, as your guys' is, is to put smiles on people's faces. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  Now, if we can do any type of entertainment, wonderful.  So those who do want to tune in, tune in tonight, Thursday, and to the pay-per-view Sunday, and  we'll try to accomplish that to the best of our ability.  Okay.  So, you know, more of tonight, we're back to business.  It's not a tribute show, as last Thursday's was.  Yeah.  And storylines are continuing to develop, and we'll be ready to roll.  You're going to get a Bin Laden character, like you did with the Iron Sheik during the  Gulf War?  Absolutely.  No way.  Something like that.  No?  You're not going to go that route? 
[01:51:00]  No.  It's quite entertaining watching Sergeant Slaughter beat up the Iron Sheik back in the...  Oh, you're going way back to the 80s.  Yeah, the old days.  Yeah, way back.  And again, we were already in that angle a long time prior, and we never thought that  we'd ever go to war.  Iron Sheik just kind of got caught in there.  Iron Sheik can't even walk anymore.  See him at WrestleMania?  Oh, the Sheiky Baba?  He won.  He won the gimmick battle roll.  Sheiky Baba.  Sheiky Baba.  Shall we talk?  I can't believe it. 
[01:51:30]  I win.  Sheiky Baba.  That's awesome.  I love it.  That's funny.  All right, Shane.  So, pay-per-view this Sunday.  Of course, tonight's Smackdown.  Yeah, if you haven't checked it out and you need to get caught back up or, again, need  a little levity, then tune back in.  If nothing else, you can see my sister's cones.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Right?  Cool.  That's two good reasons.  Yeah.  If the ratings drop, man, you know your pop is going to make her wear dropping necklines. 
[01:52:00]  She does look great, though, Shane.  I'll make sure she sends you a personalized autograph.  Yes.  Hey, do you remember Jim Norton?  He doesn't.  Well, we have our friend in the studio, Jim.  It helps us out with the show, Shane.  He said he performed at your bachelor party.  Really?  On the boat.  It was a boat.  Oh, yes.  He was very good.  He was two of us.  She was very good.  I was at a first.  He was very good.  You performed at a bachelor party?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  I do a lot of them.  This was there.  Did you take tips?  What did you do?  What is that for the alternate lifestyle people there?  Everybody ate a banana sundae out of my collar.  So they had some comedy and then some girl or something.  Yes.  Did you have a girl, Shane?  There were a few circulating.  You didn't have one of those boring bachelor parties where everyone goes to a Met game.  No.  I could see Vince, though, at the bachelor party.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  I love that.  It was fun, yeah.  That was, let's see, a little over five years ago. 
[01:53:00]  Just celebrated my fifth wedding anniversary.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Shane got the nugget.  Sorry.  We had a lot more than that.  That wasn't it.  We have a clip of Vince at the bachelor party talking to Norton.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Call around like a dog.  Beautiful.  With a banana sundae.  That is so classic, Vince, man.  A little more Vince talking to Jim Norton at the bachelor party. 
[01:53:30]  I'm wondering what color panties you're wearing tonight.  That is great.  Why do you have Mr. Norton on?  Just as comic relief?  You guys just crack at him all day?  Yeah, we have him on a lot.  Yeah, he's beautiful.  He helps out the show.  And I guess your pop wasn't happy with Jim Norton, and this is what he had to say to Jim.  You're fired!  No one fires people like Vince.  That's great.  It's like only Mr. Spacely and Vince fire people like that. 
[01:54:00]  Jimson!  You're fired!  All right, Shane.  We're going to watch Smackdown tonight, definitely.  All right, guys.  You don't need that distraction and, of course, pay-per-view on the sundae.  All the best to everyone.  When are you going to come see us?  Whenever you want.  Yeah, when you're in New York, man.  You've got to pop up.  I'm here all the time.  Bring that hot sister of yours.  Negative.  All right, man.  All right, bro.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  There you go.  It's our buddy.  And can I say that the shirts they gave out at the bachelor party, it was a nice event, 
[01:54:30]  but the shirts were awful.  It was a white T-shirt with a, what's that thing that you throw around yourself?  It's a little, it looks like a lifesaver.  It's a lifesaver.  A lifesaver.  It was like a lifesaver, like on a boat.  A life preserver?  Yeah.  It was like a drawing of a life preserver, I think, with a picture of his face, and it  said, the S.S. Shane McMahon.  It's true.  Do you still have it?  I might have thrown it out.  I saved it for a long time.  The S.S. Shane McMahon.  Now, why if it was a bachelor party? 
[01:55:00]  Because it was on a boat circling Manhattan.  It was on a boat.  So, the S.S. Shane McMahon.  That is a Nazi S.S.  Yeah, no, I understand.  It doesn't make sense, though.  I love when you get the wacky, I love when you get the wacky T-shirt at the bachelor party.  At the bachelor party?  You're never going to wear it again.  Yeah.  I had it for a long time.  I may still have it at my parents' house.  I don't know.  You know what else?  Speaking of wacky things like the bachelor party shirt or something.  When we were at Disney, last vacation that we took about a month ago, or something, the  last time you'll ever be on a plane, yes.  Yeah, right, exactly. 
[01:55:30]  The brides and grooms, the people that get married at Disney, they walk around with the  Mickey Mouse ears.  One has the top hat for the groom.  The other has the little veil thing for the bride.  And they walk around like that.  I swear to God, you just want to stab them with forks in the restaurants when you see  them walking around like that.  That's cute, though.  Isn't that just so cute?  Usually, though, I swear, every time I saw one, the only reaction I had was, how did that 
[01:56:00]  guy marry such a fat woman?  They were all, I swear to God, Midwestern just rubes with the veil in the ears.  Just fat trash.  Right.  Just having fun in the way.  Trailer trash.  Spandex pants with the socks rolled up too high and the sneakers.  Slobs.  Wonderful.  All right, more tribute songs on the way, and I think we got John Valby's song, finally?  Yeah, we're just, we're just going to go through and make sure it's fine.  It's clean for the radio.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:56:30]  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two A-holes.  Hello, Opie and Anthony.  Hi, Anthony Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Oh, who can't use a Bud Light?  After watching all the news stories and stuff, you just want to relax.  I've been trying to numb the pain.  Turn on Comedy Central.  I suggest numbing the pain with alcohol.  Nice, right?  Just don't drive.  Now, Bud Light.  You want a light beer?  Bud Light.  That's what I drink when you want a light beer. 
[01:57:00]  Because it tastes like Bud.  There's no difference, if you ask me.  When we open the fridge, there's Bud Light in there.  I go, grab me a Bud Light.  I feel like a Bud Light beer.  And it tastes like regular beer, not watered down.  Yeah, so whatever you're doing, get out.  Have fun, you know.  And drink Bud Light.  That's right.  A lot of ball games.  Getting back.  A little sports thing getting back there, right?  Well, I'm going to give it a whirl.  Well, when you're watching the games, make it a Bud Light. 
[01:57:30]  Mm-mm.  The real taste won't fill you up, never lets you down.  Make it a Bud Light.  O.P.  Answer me.  1027.  Yeah, this is the O&A show.  O.P. and Anthony.  A couple phone numbers.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4255.  Keep those phone numbers close. 
[01:58:00]  You never know when you're going to need it.  866-277-4255.  Where's Rick?  We got more tribute songs.  Bad tribute songs.  Yeah.  I wonder why O'Reilly from the O'Reilly fact, Bill O'Reilly, doesn't play the clip of what I said during the interview.  Remember when we did that little story with him? 
[01:58:30]  And he was saying that, don't you think what we do here on this show influences the audience maybe to do things and treat people certain ways and stuff?  And I said that religion is responsible for more bad things and certain religions tell their people to strap bombs to themselves and kill people.  How did he play that?  There you go.  That would be a great sound bite.  Sure took the heat off of us. 
[01:59:00]  Jackass.  I guess that won't be running.  No.  Bill O'Reilly's got better things to talk about.  Rick, where are we with the bad tribute songs?  Evil Ways, Bad Cover by Prep Burger?  Yes.  Evil Ways?  Santana, yeah.  Ah, there you go.  What's Prep Burger?  It's a, what do you call it?  Prep Burger?  One of those bad radio prep services that gives you all the stuff that you need to do a show? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, there's a...  I did tell him on this.  Well, we have already, so.  Most of the radio shows in America, they rely on these prep services to get ideas for their shows and stuff.  And there's one called Bitboard, and there's now one called Prep Burger?  Prep Burger.  Oh, there's lots of them.  Usually they're pay.  You know, you've got to pay for them.  But some of them do give out some little free tidbits. 
[02:00:00]  Which, ooh, I'm sure those are just even better than the pay ones.  Well, see, this is the benefit of this tragedy, is that they've opened up their catalog of WTC tribute songs.  Thank God for them.  Yeah, you subscribe to some of these services, and they'll send you CDs with just...  Bits.  Lots and lots of bits, and then you play it on your show, and then your audience thinks it's you.  How about the bits that they give you scripts?  Entire scripts.  You go in with the rest of your wacky morning show or something. 
[02:00:30]  And you all play parts.  And you all play the part and do it.  Or how about the ones where they record one of the people in the bit,  and you go into the studio and do your voice in the blank areas.  They believe you're talking to, I don't know, a celebrity, right?  Hey, you're doing an interview with Muhammad Ali or something,  and they'll supply the Muhammad Ali guy.  Wait a minute.  Then you put your voice in so you can, like, set up zany questions?  Zany questions.  They even write the zany questions for you.  You don't even have to come up with the zany questions.  It's all done. 
[02:01:00]  So you record it, and it's like people think you did it.  Wow.  Even though it's being done in cities all across the country.  But never overlapping cities, because that's a no-no.  Yeah, but what about the karaoke music they give you  and the already scripted out lyrics?  For the song parodies and stuff.  Are they funny?  Are they funny?  Are they funny?  They'll send you a song parody, and you can play it as is,  you know, someone else singing it,  or they'll just send you, yeah, like Rick said, the music,  and you got the script, and you sing it like you wrote this song 
[02:01:30]  and put it together in your production.  And nobody at the station puts the kibosh on that?  Oh, no.  And they're all knee sloppers.  Wow, that sounds like fun.  A little bit tickler.  Oh, my bag is going good.  Kathy, you're on the radio.  I don't think it's right that you guys are making fun of all these tribute songs.  No? Why not?  No.  Why?  Because our country's going through a lot right now,  and if it makes somebody feel better to make a song  and have everybody listen to it and have some emotion,  and then you guys are just... 
[02:02:00]  Kathy, did you listen to what I had to say about that very topic an hour and a half ago?  No.  All right, rewind the Opie and Anthony show,  and you'll hear exactly what we said about that.  All right, so then you agree with me.  So why are you still doing it?  Because they're still really bad.  We understand why they're doing it.  But they're bad.  It doesn't change the fact that these are bad songs.  Yeah, is it making them feel better writing them?  I'm sure.  They're expressing their pain in what they're going through,  but you know something, these songs stink. 
[02:02:30]  Musically, they suck.  I mean, at least they're trying.  At least they're trying to do something.  Wait, but there's also something going on with these songs that Anthony mentioned earlier.  They're hoping that one of these songs catches on  and they make a name for themselves, you know, by the song that came out.  So you think there's ulterior motives, but I think that now...  Oh, definitely.  But I don't think now people are thinking of ulterior motives.  I think they're thinking of the country.  No, well, you know, regardless, whatever they're thinking,  whatever the reasoning, good, bad, indifferent, these songs stink. 
[02:03:00]  All right, all right.  Hang the phone up, you skanker.  Guys, ma'am, ma'am.  What?  Ma'am.  Ma'am, if it makes them feel better to write it, is it wrong?  It makes us and a lot of the listeners feel better to make fun of it.  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  You just got it.  Who sent him that line?  You see what I mean?  It's nice.  Who sent him that?  Kathy, there's no way you could have a comeback to that line.  I don't.  I don't.  You set me up.  No, it's just about making people feel good.  That's all it's about.  God bless.  Thanks for calling.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  We're going to have fun with a couple more, but, you know, it's all in good nature, Rick.  You use your own words against you.  I love that.  Well, I don't.  All right, Kathy.  All right, take care.  Bye.  Say a word.  Yeah.  Bravo.  All right, Rick.  So what is this?  This is Evil Ways cover?  By Prep Burger.  Prep Burger.  Which means hundreds of radio stations across America have this song, and they're playing it  not as a goof, right?  Right.  This is serious.  All right, let's check it out.  Folks, get out your hankies. 
[02:04:00]  You'll pay for all your evil ways.  In London, it's true we will punish you without the rage.  In London, mark my words, your free life is true.  You can't be running and hiding, but we'll hunt you down.  And we'll be bombing and drowning. 
[02:04:30]  You'll enter the ground and you'll be gone.  Lord knows you're going to pay.  In London.  That's great.  That's good stuff, right?  That's the whole song?  That's it.  Whoever that made feel better to write deserves to be unhappy.  They shouldn't feel better because that's terrible.  Uh, you know what?  At least it was short.  I'll give him that.  He probably couldn't physically get through it without vomiting.  That's brutal. 
[02:05:00]  That's supposed to rile people up?  Yeah, let's go get them.  Stupid.  All right, Rick, what's the next one?  Wind Beneath My Wings.  No, it's not.  I don't believe you.  Nobody is that stupid.  Wait, get on the mic.  Give the history of this bad music song.  Please, yeah.  Again, it's off the wonderful service Prep Burger.  Prep Burger.  Good old Prep Burger.  Two, two, two bad songs in one.  Oh, they've got a catalog of crap. 
[02:05:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  How many more do we have from Prep Burger?  It's going to take a while to download some more of them because some of them just totally suck.  And some of them are just all cluttered with bad stuff.  So it's just a matter of going through them and finding the worst ones to bring them back.  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  I just, your last commercial break, flipping around the dial here, I'm heading home.  PLJ just played the rhyming song.  So I want you to, the one that was rhyming there.  The one that we were trying to figure out was. 
[02:06:00]  I just wanted to let you know that you've got something in common with Scott Shannon there.  Yeah, of course we know.  Your program directors are the best, let me tell you.  That's embarrassing.  You're horrible.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  You're the best, man.  I saw you up at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh, thanks, man.  Oh, it was awesome, man.  You did a TV interview with somebody.  I'm sitting in a hotel.  I'm laughing my ass off.  The guy didn't know what to say to you.  Thank you.  You're the best.  Thank you, Mike.  Take it easy.  Okay.  So it's a wind beneath my wings. 
[02:06:30]  At the PrepBurger radio service.  Thank you.  We never doubted that you were brave. 
[02:07:00]  It's a bad wedding with this recording, then.  The careers that were spent protecting lives.  Night and day.  We hope you'll watch from heaven's eyes.  Oh, children, now that you're our hero.  Middle of the song applause.  I love middle of the song applause. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, she's going to go.  She's going to go.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just a man against the level.  We pray that he'll trust in me.  Good.  We're a bunch of pansies.  We're sitting around enjoying this crap.  Wow.  Why don't we just surrender right now?  We're a bunch of pansies.  The voice is thinner than Van Gundy's hair. 
[02:08:00]  How is that?  I said coach.  Wow.  I agree with the sentiment, but she stinks.  She means well.  She stinks.  She means well.  Speaking of hero songs, Mariah Carey will be singing Hero during the telethon tomorrow night. 
[02:08:30]  She will?  Yeah.  They're doing Andrew Dice Clay's idea tomorrow night.  Good.  The radio slash TV thong.  Did they let her up the set of Cuckoo's Nest?  There you go.  There's some great stuff on her in the way.  It's an inquiring of a star or one of those freaky little rag magazines.  Yeah, she was running around one of the mental hospitals showing her boobs asking if anyone wanted sex.  Really?  Stop it.  Really?  Just stop right now. 
[02:09:00]  Really?  Are you kidding me?  This is all according to them, but you know what?  It turns out that half that crap in those rag magazines comes through.  It's up real.  And then she jumped in a bathtub with all her clothes on to take a bath.  That's a short sign of craziness.  She thinks she's invisible, and what was the other thing from that article?  Maybe she'd think I'm Jeter.  I should go there.  And she bought Marilyn Monroe's piano, and she's convinced Marilyn is talking to her through the piano strings.  She's probably saying, don't bang a Kennedy. 
[02:09:30]  That can happen, though.  Oh, my God.  What does Smitty have?  Smitty, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's going on, kids?  Hey.  You guys were looking for a song yesterday that you guys heard from the 70s.  One of those horrible songs.  One of you was looking for it.  Oh, O.P. was.  Yes.  Was it Billy Don't Be a Hero?  No.  No?  No.  That song sucked anyway.  It is awful.  All right, Smitty.  All right, man. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you.  Billy Don't Be a Hero.  Don't be a fool with your life.  Cracklin' Rose, you get on board.  We're going to ride till there ain't no more.  I don't know what ice is here.  Nick.  See, I'm dying to rock.  What's up, man?  What's up?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  All right.  If I got to listen to another one of these goddamn songs, I hope they attach me to the first bomb that we dropped in Afghanistan. 
[02:10:30]  This is the worst thing I've ever heard in my damn life.  That's what they should actually do, just send these over until they all just surrender.  Oh, yeah.  Ben Layton would come running out of the country with his hands up.  I give up.  I give up.  Well, it's obvious to us, but there's radio stations playing these as serious tribute songs.  They're playing them in honor.  You guys are at least playing them, making fun of them.  All right.  I can see you getting wasted and, like, making funny songs with your friends, but to send them into radio stations, this is asinine.  Well, then the radio stations turn around and play them, though.  That's the scary part.  Yeah.  What are they smoking?  All right. 
[02:11:00]  Thanks, Darren.  All right, guys.  Hey, where's our...  Rick, do we have one more?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we do.  Where was that one from AJ or whatever his name was?  Well, Ace and TJ.  Ace and TJ.  Yeah.  Ace and TJ.  That's a radio duo, right?  There are a couple of boys out of Charlotte.  Oh, I have Charlotte.  Yeah, but this is like...  God dang.  I guess this is like a real country song or something, and they just added their own drops to it.  And I think one of them is actually, you hear one of them, like, he's actually commenting, watching it on TV in the beginning. 
[02:11:30]  No, he's not.  I don't believe that.  It couldn't be that awful.  What's the song?  It's...  I don't know.  I don't recognize it.  I'll listen for a minute.  Go ahead.  Hey, it's 857.  We are watching an unbelievable scene on television.  Today, we've had an actual tragedy.  Holy ass.  Get rid of the fake radio voice.  Hey, we're watching an unbelievable tragedy.  Who's we?  Me and my lover. 
[02:12:00]  We're watching an unbelievable tragedy.  What?  Yeah, if you're live on the radio while that whole mess was going on, I mean, if that doesn't, you know, knock your radio voice out of your head, then I don't know what will.  Hey, we're here.  This is an unbelievable tragedy.  This tragedy is sponsored by Lay's Potato Chips.  You know, you can't get out of radio mode.  What an awful...  Wouldn't your reaction be, holy... 
[02:12:30]  That's...  That's why the videotapes take it from the street.  We hear people screaming like anybody else.  We're the hardest to watch.  Of course I would scream that.  Yeah.  Can you start that over?  There we go.  Hey, it's 857.  We are watching an unbelievable scene on television.  Hold on.  And he has to do a time check.  Hey, it's 857.  The weather, we're looking at 79 degrees.  Partly cloudy.  And I'm watching an unbelievable situation.  72 degrees at 857.  And we'll tell you about the unbelievable situation I'm watching right after this. 
[02:13:00]  So stick around after a twofer from Leonard Skinner.  The big radio tease.  What the...  It's doing time checks.  No, it should be holy S.  What the F is this?  Hey, it's 857.  We are watching an unbelievable scene on television.  Today we've had a national tragedy.  Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country.  Oh, my God.  The second building that was hit by the plane has just completely collapsed. 
[02:13:30]  The whole side has collapsed.  The whole building has collapsed.  Massive casualties here at the moment.  It happened so fast  Everything was a blur  And everyone came by  And said how sorry they were  And I knew that they meant well  So I tried to force a smile 
[02:14:00]  And they said I should be thankful  That I had them for a while  And I can't go  But now my friends  And my family gone  Oh, my  I'm just a lad there sitting  With my memories all alone  I've always heard  God does everything 
[02:14:30]  I just wish my angels  Weren't in heaven tonight  May God bless the victims of the universe  I've never seen  And I'm not  I'm not  Oh  Something's  Oh, my God  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not 
[02:15:00]  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  Wow  Oh  That's horrible  Why was that funny?  Carrible  What?  Awful  Why would you want to listen to that?  You're even sadder than you are.  Oh, that made me laugh.  Why would you want to be sadder?  Yeah, you want to...  This is a Food Emporium commercial.  That guy is brutal.  Mike, what's going on?  Not much.  I got halfway through that Wind Beneath My Wings song, 
[02:15:30]  and the tears just started welling up my eyes.  Really?  It wasn't emotional.  It's just I started to puke, and the vomit was running in my nostrils.  I mean, that Kathy lady said that it made her feel better when she listened to these songs.  It makes me feel better to stand naked in front of a girl's high school,  but it doesn't mean I can do it.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  Wow.  Try some of the lower grade schools.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Morning.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, I just wanted to say these songs, you know, I mean, they're riveting. 
[02:16:00]  I'm getting chills listening to these songs.  I think, really, the only thing that could warm me up is a bunch of Afghanis on fire.  Well, we can only hope.  All right.  Thank you.  In a related note, the weather for the next week, next weekend.  We got it.  We got the email.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Dave.  Bye-bye.  Dave?  Bye-bye.  I bet it was going to be really hot and mushroom cloudy.  About 2,000. 
[02:16:30]  What is the forecast for Afghanistan?  I'm saying that it's going to be 2,000 degrees.  2,000 degrees.  Oh, ho, ho.  Is that gem circling the email circuit?  Of course.  All right.  We finally got John Valby's new song.  We were goofing on the one he sent in last week.  So he went back to the drawing board, and he's trying again here, Anthony.  All right.  Is this one good, Ray?  It needed a lot of cleaning.  Oh, a lot of cursing?  Did this get through the center? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I got through them.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's see how he's in his latest creation.  Oh, we got the Taliban loose.  I know a guy.  His name's Osama.  He's from Afghanistan.  He's f***ed his mama.  He's hiding in a cave in a c***ed same pajama with his knob in the crack of a crusty old llama.  I hate bin Laden.  I hate bin Laden.  Oh, we got them Taliban loose. 
[02:17:30]  I hate the USA and what we stand for.  So the Taliban's declaring a holy war.  When our bombs begin to hit, the only thing I'll be declaring is, holy s***.  Hey, bin Laden.  Hey, bin Laden.  Oh, we got them time on the foot.  Hey, Osama.  George W. Bush is a lovin' guy, and he knows you're lonely.  That's the reason why. 
[02:18:00]  He's given a national monument to be your companion.  You're gonna turn your cave into a grand canyon.  Hey, bin Laden.  Hey, bin Laden.  Oh, we got them time on the foot.  He's got a beaver on his face, a diaper on his head.  Before too much longer, he's gonna be dead.  And when he dies, he might see God that's true.  But he's gonna find out that God's a Jew.  Hey, bin Laden. 
[02:18:30]  Hey, bin Laden.  Oh, we got them time on the foot.  All right, one more.  Five times a day, they stop and pray.  But soon they'll be bound to the USA.  And all you bastards that support jihad.  Open your mouth, here comes all the sand s***.  Hey, bin Laden.  Hey, bin Laden.  Oh, we got them time on the foot. 
[02:19:00]  All right, there you go.  The ladies are John Valby.  There you go.  A little better than...  Can we get the unedited version up on the website?  We're gonna get you.  Yeah, we can probably do that.  It's better than we're gonna get you.  I enjoyed this one very much.  It had a little more spirit being on it.  I like that.  That's more John Valby.  Yeah, we're also cleaning up the spoken word thing that he sent us to.  He did a spoken word?  Steve's got it.  Hold on.  Hey, Steve.  Not yet.  Steve, could you put the unedited version of that on Foundry Music?  Yeah.  Yeah, it'll be up later on tonight. 
[02:19:30]  I'm still working on the other one.  Okay.  I mean, I'm sure as good as John's intentions were in bleeping them already,  I've got to go through them again with John and...  Maybe before the end of the show.  We'll do the unspoken word from John Valby, all right?  And the unedited version of that song you just heard will be on FoundryMusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  Yes.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  All right?  Yike.  Any more tribute songs, Rick?  We've got a few more.  I like these. 
[02:20:00]  You liking this hit?  Oh, yeah.  One of our Sacramento competitors.  One of our Sacramento competitors?  That song they're playing on their airwaves?  Yeah.  Laszlo from Brooklyn about the Valby song.  This is a bit better.  But the first one was so bad that it's funnier.  Hmm.  Interesting little turmoil.  John's going to have to overcome that.  Opie and Anthony.  W-N-E number two. 
[02:20:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Anne-Marie wants in real fast.  Anne-Marie?  Yes?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Not much.  I'm an EMT and I was down at the site from the plane's first hit.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, I haven't laughed the way I did with that Ben-Lotten song just now.  Oh.  That was fantastic.  The John Valby one?  Yes.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, good.  Absolutely fantastic.  Cool.  That made my day. 
[02:21:00]  Well, thanks, Anne-Marie.  I appreciate it, guys.  Hang in there, okay?  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I want to know what's going on with the guys down on the beer run down there.  Oh, Operation Beer Infinity?  Exactly.  Or Infinity Beer?  Where they at?  Infinite Beer.  Earl is back.  Can we get Earl back in the studio?  We were not successful on our mission.  Ben's in the studio.  Yes, Ben?  I think Earl will not comment, as usual. 
[02:21:30]  He's not commenting.  I called him several times while this was all going on.  He would pick up his cell phone and hang up, and then I just received an update that he  was punching the console of the van over and over again when this whole thing was happening.  Well, wasn't John Rossi down there with him?  Get John in here, then.  Psycho Mark.  Dude, this is absolutely unacceptable.  This is unacceptable behavior.  I totally agree.  You know, I mean, he doesn't have to punch the van.  It's not, I mean, who cares?  If he, it takes him five hours to get the beer in, don't stop doing it. 
[02:22:00]  The last we heard, they told Earl to loop around.  Loop around.  Did he loop around?  What happened to him?  Loop around, not.  We need to know if he looped around.  I doubt it.  I bet he went right on.  All right.  Oh, and hey, take care, man.  Hopefully they get the beer in, man.  All right, Chris.  We'll get the beer down there somehow.  All right.  All right, man.  Later.  Yeah, they're trying to hunt down Earl or John and see what happens.  Just ponderous.  It's just ponderous. 
[02:22:30]  Wow, the market took a big hit today also.  Dude, I'm right by the stock exchange right now.  It's actually on the other side of the building.  Yeah, I was down at $83.76, the lowest in three years now.  And the NASDAQ, remember when we were all celebrating when it hit $5,000, NASDAQ $5,000?  And we're at $1,470.  $1,470.  $1,470.  $1,470.  $1,470.  And we were all celebrating NASDAQ $5,000 for that hour that it was $5,000. 
[02:23:00]  What was the Dow reaction on it today?  Dow is down $382.  Yeah, I think it's at $38.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we're trying to get Stockbroker Dave on the phone, but even he doesn't want to talk.  It's sad down here.  I'll tell you the faces of all the...  I was right outside the stock exchange.  Mark, we know.  We're trying to get away.  We don't need to be sadder.  We're all sad.  I understand.  That's what we're...  All right, anyhow, let's think about how we're going to get the frigging beer down here.  Well, dude, we got...  Yes, Ben.  I went back there. 
[02:23:30]  I've...  You know, Earl gets pissed.  Earl is...  Get away!  What?  Damn it!  Why is he pissed?  Why is he angry?  Dude, he was flipping out in the truck.  Yeah, John's giving stuff.  He was, like, yelling at cops.  He was yelling at cops?  Yeah, because he was...  Well, I'm no wonder!  Oh!  You're not...  You can't yell at cops.  Don't yell at cops.  They have enough going on.  So what happened when they told you to loop around, John?  Looped around.  We went to, like, the four checkpoints, and they finally sent us down to the Bowery. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  And they just laughed at us.  They're like, we're not letting O&A down here.  I was like, we're not letting O&A down there.  We weren't in the van.  It was the beer.  I was like, I just want to drop off some kegs.  They're like, no, there's not a chance of getting down here.  Oh.  Where is this bar we're supposed to send the kegs to?  Nobody knew.  Every cop did not know...  It's right on West Broadway.  There's one on West Broadway, and there's one right on Hanson.  But do you have to go through the FBI to get to this bar?  No, you don't have to go through the FBI.  We're the worst. 
[02:24:30]  He doesn't know.  He's an effing tool.  No, it's just amateur night with Earl.  All right.  All right.  You know, I'll get him in.  I'll get him in later on.  Come down here now.  Let's see what's going on.  All right.  You want me to meet you down there at the checkpoint?  I can get out of my camera shot.  Drive down right now, and I'll meet you.  All right.  I'll meet you there.  Let's end the show with some good news with Operation Infinite Beer, or whatever the hell  we're calling it.  All right.  I'm on my way.  All right, John.  Can you go?  Screw her all.  All right.  Where do you want me to meet you? 
[02:25:00]  Just pull down there.  Ben will give you my cell phone number.  Call me en route, and I will get a checkpoint through where you'll be able to come through.  Okay?  All right.  Good.  Hold on.  I'll see how tough you really are now.  Wow.  John's pissed at Mark.  Yeah.  Why are you pissed at him?  No, because, I mean, he doesn't really know, I guess.  It's like, there's 15 cops at each checkpoint.  You listen to me, Schnapperhead.  I got 10 vans in here in the last week, okay?  All Fox vans, all brass from Fox. 
[02:25:30]  They went right through.  Uh-oh.  Here comes Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Earl.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get your drunken, coke-up head down at this radio station.  Now, you take the goddamn beer, okay?  Wow.  We're going to duck out like crazy.  Earl came in with three FUs in a row and totally ate up our delay. 
[02:26:00]  There may have been a C-S-er in there, too.  Wow.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  You know where it is.  Come and get it.  I will, mother-ass.  I'll show you how it's done.  You know where the bar is?  Oh, wait, wait.  We both dumped here.  We're out of delay.  And Earl laughed.  We just both dumped out. 
[02:26:30]  Don't know what he's on.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  What the hell was that?  I don't know what that was, but we ran out of delay.  Earl cursed some more and then ran out of the studio.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Earl was heated.  Happened to happen.  I'm going to sell the studio.  I'll meet you people, eh?  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[02:27:00]  All right, listen.  All right, John is on his way, I think.  We're going to put you on hold, Mark.  We only have like 20 minutes left in the show.  Dude, I'm running out right now.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Earl's got a good suggestion.  Do you know where to meet him, John?  No.  Oh.  Well, he's got his cell phone number.  Ben, give him his cell phone number.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Earl's got another comment.  Earl?  What?  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.  All right.  Really, Earl?  Okay, good.  I understand, man.  You ever did so?  All right. 
[02:27:30]  Charcoal briquette.  All right.  A little yarn.  Tony Soprano.  Stop it.  We cleaned up the John Valby spoken word.  And do we have one more tribute song that we can play today, Rick?  Yeah, I just finished it.  All right.  Well, while you get that, let's play the John Valby spoken word.  Spoken word.  Yeah, I think it's one of those poems he does.  Oh, okay.  You guys said you hate poems, but let's see what John's got up his sleeve, okay?  All right.  Here's to Osama bin Laden. 
[02:28:00]  That towel-head scum.  May the U.S. blast his ass to Kingman God.  He's a bagless wonder that lives in a cave.  May Marines butt wiser on that sucker's life.  Osama, being a chicken sh** faggot, lives off camel turds with a topping of maggots. 
[02:28:30]  Osama thinks we don't have the guts to come and blow off his Islamic nuts.  But now America is done with his crap.  So let's just move the f**kers off the map.  So here's to Osama, that s**t of a b**ch. 
[02:29:00]  May his p***** fall off with a seven-year ips.  And may they bid on his d***** with a big brass hammer till his a**hole whistles the star spangled back.  All right.  There you have it.  USA!  All right.  USA team.  I'm assuming Steve from FoundryMusic.com will put the unedited version of that on the website as well. 
[02:29:30]  This is great.  I have a little problem.  Hold on.  Yeah.  With John Valby.  What?  I've been going to see John Valby for 15 years.  Yeah.  I've heard that same poem, but instead of Osama bin Laden, it's been Muammar Gaddafi,  Saddam Hussein, and the Ayatollah.  Right.  Well, insert bad guy here.  Insert bad guy here poem from John Valby.  I wonder if he'll call to defend himself. 
[02:30:00]  Listen to part of this comment from U.S. Representative John Cooksey, the Republican from Louisiana.  Someone wearing a diaper on his head should be expected to be interrogated.  Wow.  John Cooksey, Republican, Louisiana.  Salute.  Yeah, people just not happy.  Nice.  A diaper on his head.  You've got to love that.  And I hope it's with that Louisiana drawl.  Someone wearing a diaper on his head can expect to be interrogated. 
[02:30:30]  That is so great.  A dirty.  That's great.  All right.  So, back to the bad tribute songs?  Yeah.  Okay, what do we got?  We got hundreds of these, dude.  Yeah.  We're just going to pepper them in.  We all know the Lee Greenwood song, God Bless the USA, that's now popular again.  We do?  Uh, yeah, it's the one everybody's talking about.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That one.  Well, somebody decided they're going to redo it.  Because, God Bless the USA, wasn't enough. 
[02:31:00]  They decided to add in some more stuff and make it their own.  It's pretty terrible.  And, uh, a station in Sacramento's playing this?  No, this one is, uh, this is another, this is another charmer off Prep Burger.  Another one from Prep Burger.  Prep Burger.  Can we send one plane to the Prep Burger headquarters?  It'll improve, uh, radio greatly.  Can we, can we make a tribute?  We'll get, um, Billy Joel's Angry Young Man and put all of Earl's clips to it. 
[02:31:30]  We should really get that together.  Yeah, we got to start our own, uh, Angry Young Man.  Change it to Incompetent Young Man.  No, just throwing all the little breaks, have his various tirades he's been holding, uh, for the, over three years here.  Yeah, we got some great audio from Earl today.  None of it made their radio, but maybe tomorrow we could clean that up.  Okay, here we go.  I'm nauseous already.  Awful.  It's the time to show the world why strong. 
[02:32:00]  We won't be terrorized.  Evil's not allowed to win  When you've got heaven on your side  It's for the ones we've lost  That we stand up strong today  Cause the flag still stands for freedom  And they won't take that away  Break out your lighters, everyone.  And we're standing strong as Americans 
[02:32:30]  Where at least we know we're free  And we want to look at  The ones who died  On that Tuesday morning  And we're going to stand  I just slipped that in  He's almost doing good with workplace physical men  Cause we'll never fall  Cause we'll never fall when we are set  God bless the U.S.A.  Take it to the miles 
[02:33:00]  Take it to the miles  And we're standing strong as Americans  And the Americans  We're at least we know we're free  And we're Bhads  The songs are done  And the songs come to believe  Everybody knows one  Many months  Oof  Medien morning  And we're going to stand  And see if the ruin defenders do today  Cause we'll never fall when we are sad 
[02:33:30]  God bless the U.S.A.  These songs make us look like a bunch of pansies.  Just a whole nation of Marys.  A bunch of pansies.  Who's in their car cranking that up?  No one.  No one is.  No one.  Thank you, Prep Burger.  Not even him.  Thank you. 
[02:34:00]  Anthony, wow, our listeners, they work quick.  Yeah.  We got another Bad Tribute song.  Uh-huh.  This one is about Operation Infinite Fear.  All right.  We need to live a caggot.  We need to live a caggot.  We need to live a caggot.  We need to live a caggot.  No, we don't.  We need to live a caggot.  Go F yourself.  We don't deliver caggot. 
[02:34:30]  Go F yourself.  He had a very, very sad Arnold Drummond-ish pout.  Didn't he?  Yeah, he was very upset.  I pity the fool.  I pity the fool trying to make me deliver caggot.  For the kids.  Stay off the drugs and stay in school.  Gay Marco.  Hey!  Hey.  Oh, wait.  The somber hey.  I know.  Hey.  I know.  Know what it is?  It's like the somber Brady Bunch theme.  Remember that?  Remember you watched the Brady Bunch?  And when they were like, they're doing something fun. 
[02:35:00]  It was...  And then Greg gets caught smoking.  Father and mother have a talk to them.  Do, do, do, do.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  It wasn't his jacket, though.  Of course not.  When they have that, uh, talk.  What, what disease does dad have?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Holy.  Boom, d-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. 
[02:35:30]  Here's the story of a lovely lady.  Her name was Cracklin' Rosie.  Get on board.  So we got the somber hey tonight.  Yes.  Can I hear the somber hey again?  Hey.  That sounds like the tired hey after you got banged.  Dang, bang.  Oh, my God.  That's like, hey.  Now. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, now.  What's up, Marco?  Well, today in the paper, did you see?  They're going to allow gays in the military.  Howdy, faggot.  Oh.  And I, if they let me, I'm going to go and join up.  But you know what?  I'm so tired of hearing all these horrible songs.  I decided to write my own big Broadway-like theme song.  You know, and it's really good.  That's disgusting.  This is a work in progress, but I want to perform it for you right now, if I may. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Gay Marco's Bad Tribute Song.  Hey, Mr. Ben Laden, listen to me.  You're messing with the land of the brave and the home of the free.  It's a show tune.  It's a show tune.  It's a show tune.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  We're just gays in the military.  You might get shot by a great big fairy.  So, poor little Osama, you should have listened to your mama and not been such a big bully. 
[02:37:00]  We're going to kick your butt in.  Come on to your turban.  Our bombs are going to deal you in.  It's just about time for you to pay.  Watch out for the big bad USA.  You're a girl.  That was the best song we heard today.  Wow, there you go. 
[02:37:30]  I'll say it.  You know something?  Thank you.  I bet it's even better.  That's a winner.  I bet it's even better with the dance number.  How did you know?  I was dancing all over the room as I was singing it.  Oh, God.  Top hats, canes.  The Roaring 20s.  I can see it now.  Like a Busby Berkeley musical.  The homo faggot queer.  Hey, all right.  Well, that's my little contribution to your show.  All right, Mark.  Very good. 
[02:38:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Take care.  I love you.  I'm so glad to hear you.  I had a horrible time in Europe.  You know, I was trying to...  Enough.  Enough.  Hang up.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Always funny.  A horrible time in Europe.  You had to get through all that pesky foreskin.  Wow.  Line of the day.  I'll bow.  I'll bow.  I'm bowing today. 
[02:38:30]  She likes that.  Yeah, he did say he likes it.  Right.  Oh, my God.  He rolls it over his head like a Klansman's hat.  Did we have one more tribute song or no?  Do you want to do the Sacramento tune?  Yeah.  Is it an original?  No, it's done to the Who, but...  Is it bad?  Done to a Who song.  Yeah, this is another thing.  We need a bad.  It can't be anything but bad.  What Who song? 
[02:39:00]  No, No War.  No, No War.  Okay.  So they're going to play that song and then they'll have clips and stuff?  I'm sure they will.  Oh, it's more clip stuff?  Just to a song?  Yeah, it's from VRXQ.  Real quick.  All right, we'll see how much we get through.  Go ahead.  A terrible, terrible tragedy has befallen my nation, but it has befallen all the nations  of this region, all the nations of the world, befallen all those who believe in democracy.  The doorman who goes to me, wow, I never seen a plane flying so low. 
[02:39:30]  And we looked out at it, all of a sudden, boom, it seemed like it wasn't even real.  The governor and I just spoke to the president of the United States.  The coordination with the federal government from the time of the first attack has been  excellent, including closing off the airspace around Manhattan.  I don't know why, and if I ever do, I won't know for sure, we'll be fighting who.  We see terrorists.  Well, a song that lost the truth.  The big explode happened.  Now, we'll see who that's the rest of the room starts to fall. 
[02:40:00]  I'm having it up.  How about you?  That was heinous.  Hey, good job, Sacramento.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and we'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show  today?  Mm-hmm.  All right?  All right.  I'm exhausted from the tribute songs.  We have more tomorrow, right, Randy?  Deuce Your Dressing.  Yeah.  Sorry, I haven't put that in somewhere.  Deuce Your Dressing.  Deuce Your Dressing.  Totally Stoned Radio.  Don't forget The Weakest Dink. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, The Weakest Dink.  Squish.  I'm asleep.  Let me know.  Oh, The Weakest Dink.  Like that down.  From the Kingdom of Naked is Totally Stoned Radio.  With Deuce Your Dressing.  Deuce Your Dressing.  Deuce Your Dressing.  What do we learn next?  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show is dirty. 
[02:41:00]  Uh, Anthony, WWF, SmackDown, tonight at 8 o'clock on UPN.  Yes, last Monday on Rock, Kurt Angle drove Stone Cold Steve Austin right to the edge.  Can Stone Cold beat the Olympic hero?  The Rattlesnake will do anything to foil Kurt's attempt to capture the WWF Championship.  Tune in to WWF SmackDown tonight at 8 o'clock on UPN.  It took Stephanie McMahon, Helmsley, and the huge cans.  Test, Shane McMahon, and Booker T to bring down the rock on Raw.  How will the WCW champion, the rock, deal with the Alliance on SmackDown tonight? 
[02:41:30]  Hmm.  Plus, the seven-time tag team champs, Edge and Christian, have now gone their separate ways.  Christian believes whatever Edge can do, he can do better.  But Edge's assault on Christian last Monday has taken this family feud to a home lover.  See, I'm snorting now.  Now, I'm looking at the time.  Tonight on WWF SmackDown, just three days before Unforgiven, will Stone Cold Steve Austin be held and done revenge?  Will the Rock lay the SmackDown on those who assaulted him?  Will the emotions between brothers Edge and Christian erupt once more?  Hmm, anything can happen. 
[02:42:00]  Three days out from Unforgiven on WWF SmackDown tonight at 8 on UPN.  All right, Psycho Mark, what's up?  Tune, I'm sitting right at Canal Street, and I've got an avenue open.  I already have police permission to just bring the vehicle in, unload the content at the bar, and we're all good to go. 
[02:42:30]  As soon as you get there, they're coming in.  All right.  Stay in the line, okay?  Yep, right here.  All right.  There we go.  You might be successful after all.  I hope so.  It's the delivery of the beer.  Anthony, a quick round of what did we learn on the O&A show today?  Let's go right to the phones, all right?  All right.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I learned a couple things.  Go ahead.  I learned that anyone wearing diapers on their head can expect to be searched.  Yeah.  And I also learned that Rick and Europeans are both uncircumcised. 
[02:43:00]  Nice job, Kelly.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Dave.  Dave, what did you learn today?  Yeah, two things about Earl.  Yeah.  He sounds a little taller on the radio.  And also, I think he's off the Zoloft because he needs that to keep from killing you all.  Yeah, we're a little scared to go back to the office after the show today.  Thank you, Dave.  So, let's move on to Orlando.  Orlando, what did you learn?  What's up?  I learned two things. 
[02:43:30]  One, I learned la, la, la, never good in a song.  Yeah.  And I hang up, always funny.  Cool.  Thank you, bro.  Dennis, what did you learn today?  I learned that Norton sits next to his mother and says, okay, fast forward.  Good job, Dennis.  Jason, you're next.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  I learned today that the difference between cat crap and dog crap is, while they're both horrible,  one has to taste better than the other.  Later, guys.  Very good. 
[02:44:00]  Let's go to Jamie.  Jamie, what did you learn today?  Yeah, I learned that Dr. Sturdy has a song for all wars.  Just take out the bad guy's name, insert a new one.  Very nice.  That is so true.  Let me go to Isaac.  Isaac, what did you learn today?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Earl's new name, black Earl's new name is Mr. E instead of Mr. T.  I'm better to fool.  Don't have to give a beer.  I learned it sucks to be the first guy on the national line.  Peace out, Norton.  You rule.  That's funny.  That's good.  It sucks to be the first guy on the national line. 
[02:44:30]  And that call will never get through.  That's very good.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, I learned a couple things today.  All right.  C-3PO has a copyrighted tribute song.  And Earl is actually attracted to Psycho Mark.  Wow.  All right.  Nice.  Let's move on to Joe.  Get the beer through for the kids.  Joe, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I learned two things.  Yeah.  One, the only person sadder than me listening to those tribute songs is the pathetic tool  who wrote them.  Okay.  And two, the only thing heavier than my heart after hearing them is Stephanie McMahon's 
[02:45:00]  huge cones.  The other city's getting the whole what did we learn game.  I love it.  Bob, what's up?  Bobby.  Yeah.  We got a good flow.  Let's go.  What do you got?  I learned that Neil Diamond rock.  Thank you, Bob.  Forever in blue jeans.  Oh, you rock, man.  All right, Bob.  And Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Norton serves banana splits from his colon. 
[02:45:30]  All right, bro.  How's it going?  Thank you.  What an educational show this was.  Really fast.  Hydrated peach.  I learned prep burgers turning us into a nation of marriage, one tribute song at a time.  I learned that Scorch comes up with bits while lying naked in bed.  That's from BJ.  Tracy writes, I learned that Operation ONA Kager to the rescue was put to a halt because  not enough looping was done.  And that is it.  All right, man.  We'll get out of here.  All right, man.  Thanks, guys.  I hope we gave you a few chuckles today. 
[02:46:00]  Just going for a little distraction.  We know how serious everything is.  And let's never forget.  You know that, okay?  Of course.  And I'm going to do a quick plug.  I'm going down to Paisano's tonight to help out.  Are you?  Yeah, Joey's really, really hurting at Paisano's.  So a bunch of us are going down to show a little support down there in Little Italy.  All right?  That's a good idea on Mulberry Street.  You've got to support the people downtown because they're hurting bad.  Yeah, man.  I've got to say hi to Steve, the victim from McFarland Toys.  He's hooking us up with some of the really cool collector's item toys from, like, Jaws and 
[02:46:30]  what was the other one?  The Leatherface.  Leatherface.  The Leatherface.  You've got to see this from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Steve C. has it.  It's unbelievable.  So thanks a lot on McFarland Toys.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Ben's freaking out.  Bye.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You want to do this?  Oh.  The Leatherface has remained.  No longer will our penises remain blasted and unused.  1027-WN-U-W. </pre>
