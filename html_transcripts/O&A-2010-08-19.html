<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about a bed bug infestation in a Times Square movie theater, sparking conversations about the general uncleanliness of New York City, particularly in public spaces and movie theaters.  This led to humorous anecdotes from the hosts and callers about personal experiences with bed bugs, other pests (fleas, roaches), and various unsanitary conditions in NYC and elsewhere.  The conversation branched into discussions about the use of GPS tracking technology in social media and its implications for privacy,  the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in movie theaters (discussed jokingly), gang activity in certain NYC theaters, and personal experiences with relationships and trust issues. Callers Jeff (Indiana), Ivan (Jersey), David (Long Island), Danny (hotel worker), Bobby (truck driver), Justin (Boston), and Matt contributed to these discussions. The hosts mentioned an upcoming guest, Ian Halperin, and referenced the website "whatwouldtylerdurden.com." One host recounted a bizarre experience with curdled milk in his cereal.

The show then shifted to a discussion of New York City's deteriorating infrastructure, focusing on neglected street cleaning, potholes, and the resulting damage to vehicles. One host described significant car damage caused by a pothole.  This transitioned into a lengthy segment on the controversy surrounding the proposed mosque near Ground Zero.  Studio guest Ann Coulter participated in this discussion, offering commentary and engaging in debates about the political implications of the mosque's location, public opinion, and the responses of politicians (including Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi) and religious leaders. The hosts and Coulter criticized the Democrats' handling of the situation and offered opinions on the motivations and actions of those involved.  A caller expressed anger at Coulter’s presence.  Brief mentions were made of concert ticket prices (including a failed attempt to get Ozzy Osbourne tickets), John Sterling’s Yankees home run calls, and a physical altercation between Joe Perry and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.  A debate between Coulter and James Carville was also mentioned.

The next segment continued with Ann Coulter as a guest, delving into conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 and birtherism, political correctness on college campuses, and Coulter's experiences with censorship and backlash.  The hosts discussed Coulter's personality and childhood.  A debate between Coulter and Rick Sanchez regarding a controversial claim about John Lewis was also featured.  This segment included a highly sexually explicit phone call with Ian Halperin, who detailed his experiences in Sweden, including encounters with a Swedish princess and other celebrities.  Halperin’s conversation was filled with vulgar language and boasts about sexual exploits.  The segment concluded with audio clips from the Rick Sanchez debate and a news blooper featuring Ernie Anastas.

The final segment covered a variety of unconnected topics.  The show started with a nonsensical exchange about Dean Martin and Italian stereotypes, then moved to a discussion of Jim Florentine and the birth of his son, followed by complaints about American Airlines' new "express seat" fees.  Derogatory comments about Ken Howard from *The White Shadow* were made.  A news story about a man arrested for ejaculating into a coworker's water bottle was discussed.  Caller Chris commented on the American Airlines issue, and Opie shared his airline experiences.  Jonathan's alleged ticket acquisition strategies were discussed with humorous and offensive insinuations about his sexuality. A clip showing a bull charging a crowd at a bullfight was shown, prompting reactions about brutality and cultural significance.  Caller Jason shared a story about a porn star's tattoo.  The show then moved to a discussion of various offensive and bizarre tattoos, particularly those on penises. Bill Clinton's birthday and a story about a Disney employee who wanted to wear a hijab at work were briefly mentioned, with the hosts expressing negative opinions.  Caller Rally from North Carolina discussed his job, opinions on Obama, and preference for country music. The show concluded with a discussion about the lack of animal rights activism for insects and a joke about Magic Johnson.

[00:01:30]  one when i officially will not be going to any more movie theaters in the new york city area  and i used to think it was crazy to not want to you know deal with people and sit in a movie theater  exactly we're learning uh this morning that there's bedbugs in one of the movie theaters very close to  where we're broadcasting now right there in uh beautiful times square and uh iraq stupid iraq 
[00:02:00]  and i like the little fellow but he's stupid he announces to everybody well i'm not going to that theater  anymore and i'm like do you understand what this story really means yeah uh here comes iraq  did you not say i'm not going to that theater anymore of course i did okay and my my point broke on the  popcorn concession my point is if they're finding bedbugs in one fucking theater in new york city 
[00:02:30]  safe to say most of these fucking movie theaters have bedbugs yep but that theater catered to bedbugs  and the type of films they're like do you know they had a yeah yeah they had like the bedbug  wanderer they had all kinds of weird bedbug movies they had a bedbug film festival yeah  yeah i do remember that was i a bit harsh iraq do you understand though i if they're finding bedbugs  in one movie theater that most likely a lot of movie theaters in new york city have them yes but what  i was also leading to is i because i used to go to that movie theater a lot i stopped kind of going 
[00:03:00]  when you guys announced that it was really uh a theater for in gang territory right where one gang  would go to that theater and then the other one would go to the one across the street that's what  so many people told us that they actually had to build another movie theater in that area just to  get the gang violence down yeah so and then everyone knows okay if you're part of this gang you go here  if you're part of this gang you go over there was that the movie theater where we saw semi-pro in  yeah where we thought everyone was so excited to see us yeah yeah that's fantastic i actually went to 
[00:03:30]  that fucking theater that day to see that stupid cock movie you've you never saw the movie why  yeah i know no you you slept through the entire i mean i'm you didn't just doze off you slept  through the entire movie entire movie what is that my favorite story and what you walked in what  happened you walked in and i took it all in like yeah you know wow did you wave back oh yeah  way back make a long story short then i i uh turned around to see that the radio station was 
[00:04:00]  throwing out frisbees and t-shirts and that's why everyone's hands were up of course i thought they  were excited at the arrival of opie and anthony were you embarrassed oh my god i couldn't slump down  of my seat fast enough it's a degenerate fucking theater by the way by the way because they didn't  promote it properly not only were they not there to see us not one person in the theater knew who we  were no it was it was the complete opposite of what i thought they ushered in like homeless and gang 
[00:04:30]  members because they want to fill up the theater for the free screening because you know it was at noon  on a tuesday so just just the you know what the problem is sorry it's the great unwashed just the  fucking disgusting people that that have parasites bugs on them bed bugs that would explain why  everybody's got them though because man that's where everybody meets and you sit for like an hour and a 
[00:05:00]  half you have food crawl in your shit they're crawling on yes then you fucking go home and  and there they are in your house yeah not only am i not going to movie theaters i don't think i'm going  to any public places anymore because that means a lot of the shit in time square has to have bed  bugs think about because like you guys just said you go to the theater a bunch of these bed bugs  hop in your back pocket and then you go and eat somewhere now you take them home i i won't go to  any place where you look around for any length of time and say would i ever invite any of these 
[00:05:30]  people over my house oh and it's like you could never live in new york city then no it's a melting  pot i hate the melting pot you can't even live in your own neighborhood it's true so that's the big  story bed bugs and i i hope i'll play the clip from the news because it's worth it i i hope they  mention what i read in the paper today oh because you know the whole theory of hose it down and you  know and keep business as usual right well they try to hose well let me play the clip first new 
[00:06:00]  yorkers need to realize that that bed bugs are here and this isn't something that just happened  overnight i'll go fuck yourself the bed bugs are here they're queer they're fabulous get used to us  we're here man this is a man guy thing that just happened overnight richard cooper is a bed  bug expert he has written a book on bed bugs and has a website on the blood-sucking critters  cooper is not surprised by the latest city business to shut down temporarily to fight the nasty insects 
[00:06:30]  certainly a movie theater might be more at risk because people bring in their belongings or backpacks  or their handbags they sit down in a dark theater for a couple of hours the amc empire 25 movie theater  closed tuesday night for extermination and reopened again wednesday according to an amc spokesperson  the closure was part of a two-week follow-up treatment after the bugs were found on theater  seats earlier on this month it doesn't sound like they closed the theater a lot in that two-week 
[00:07:00]  period no no i don't remember hearing about that and this was uh big news everyone knew they were  closing the theater tuesday for bed bugs and they reopened on wednesday yeah and they reopened and it  was kind of like it was a jaws thing like they had a couple dozen people like going to the movie  theater savages that probably hadn't heard about it and then they heard when they got inside and  half those people left said fuck this you're trying to tell me there's no more bed bugs in this theater  liar because you're sprayed a little disgusting fucking savages with their bugs i hear their bites hurt 
[00:07:30]  too get out of here i hear it's not fun i wonder if it's worse than a flea bite oh probably is because  the flea bites i'm still obsessed with to this day oh god burn your shit just burn your fucking shit  my girlfriend worked in a place that got closed recently because of bugs like really yeah she  didn't work there when it closed right after it's a new store a nice store too really that's a bed bug  yeah look at it kind of looks like a flea right or a tick like a brown tick like a big fat ant 
[00:08:00]  and here's the second part of the story reports of the pests have been mounting with sightings in  apartment buildings retail facilities and offices all across the city cooper says new yorkers need to  arm themselves against bed bugs to start with he suggests getting a protective cover for your mattress  so if you do bring bed bugs home they have nowhere to hide also when you go to the movies leave those 
[00:08:30]  big bags at home you see cooper says that bed bugs like to get inside your bag while you're in the  movie theater and hitch a ride home with you also think about this tip put your clothes in the washing  machine when you get home this way if you bring any home on your clothing you'll wash them right away  how about just put your clothes in the washing machine at some point in your life you filthy  fucking animals are you trying to say that's who's bringing them in are you trying to say it's the 
[00:09:00]  filthy fucking it's the filthy animals let's be real about this please what do you mean by filthy  uh fucking animal i mean people that don't fucking wash people that wear the same clothes that they  cover up their stench with cologne oh college kids and no no college kids can't afford laundry so they  have to wear the same things over no i'm not really getting to that people that uh whose whose homes are  disgusting the fucking go to the movies as a place to uh take their fucking 19 children to babysit 
[00:09:30]  them that's the people i'm talking about we all know where these bed bugs are coming from stop it  well it doesn't you think that bed bugs in the seats when gone with the wind was playing  i submit to you no probably had some scurvy or something though yeah yeah something some fucking  ridiculous malaria yeah yeah polio you got polio was marching across the fucking there's polio in  the movie theater well it does help your cause that the story i read this morning they said the whole

[00:10:30]  pile of bed bugs what if there was some dark chocolate mixed in with the bed bugs would you eat  them could we get bed bugs dipped in uh dark chocolate i don't want to see a fucking bed bug  that's a bit for the show down at the m&m store maybe bed bug yeah pop tart now i wonder what's  the name of their store i used to go shopping and bed bug and beyond that's kind of funny chip i know  it is that's why i said it they're they're the the magic johnson theaters cater to people in lower 
[00:11:00]  income neighborhoods that's where these theaters are built magic johnson was um commended for building  theaters in areas that um you know a lot of people wouldn't uh put a business well here in new york  he built one in harlem but that's yeah but they're turning harlem around well he built it before they  were really turning it around well he was uh he was a pioneer he went in there and said look we could  turn this thing around he was a brave businessman well i don't think he's gonna go down in black  history as one of the bravest businessmen ever i know that the the area is being turned around uh and

[00:13:30]  i was just biking through that whole area what is a school bus doing in that picture two days ago i was  up there on my bike aunt i'm telling you it's not a scary place during the day no i i'm not brave  enough to go up there at night although someone turned me on to some kind of like soul food on the  project some soul food food restaurant and the big one and we decided uh something spoon um sugar  bread spoon bread spoon spoon bread something like that yes and we uh we said you know what you know 
[00:14:00]  the person that suggested this seems like uh you know cool person they were doing some work in my  house setting you up to rob you probably because then we went up there in my car and uh honestly i'm  not gonna lie to you at night uh we were too scared to get out and check out the place yeah were you  trying to be like mr fucking no no make you make the world a better place at night you're gonna go  no no i like checking shit out man this city has a lot to offer i like checking shit out in the 
[00:14:30]  daytime but i was smart enough to realize i'm too white to walk around there at night yeah or maybe  i was a little too paranoid i don't know but during the day i bike through that area and i'm fine with  it i've never had a problem yeah she goes out and charges your bike and fucking tackles you now you go  to the end of see the park and then you go up a little bit and then i cut back down to to the river so  i go right through harlem all right how far above the park are you going oh dude i once went above 
[00:15:00]  the park where i actually saw um gangs and not one i told that story on the air i got lost there's  parts of manhattan that are downright holy shit scary yeah and this was in the middle of the day  there wasn't one sign in english i don't even know what language it was no joke there were gangs on  street corners i was scared out of my fucking mind yeah you don't go up there no i i i  fucked up though because i i took my bike all the way to the gwb yeah and then i decided you 
[00:15:30]  know what i'm gonna find my way to central park and look at all the area you have to go through to  finally get to central park keep going down on the google map yeah i did that whole stretch yeah  lost is that somalia right there yeah a little somalia i went through fucking the congo i think i  saw like i think it was like dominicans or something yeah badass dominicans in one area so what  you just like head west as quickly as possible so you can hit the fucking henry hunson i found  henry hudson i found broadway and i thought that would be okay but i realized there's parts of 
[00:16:00]  broadway that are really really scary when you get way up there but donald mike made fun of me because  i told the story on the air and he called me after the show said dude do me a favor we're friends  don't ever do that again really trust me yeah it doesn't matter what time of day i was i was just  biking in the middle of the street yeah because i was trying like you know be safe and be near the  sidewalk i figured it was safer to be driving in and out of fucking moving traffic oh it is then  on the curb would have to be so one stick in your spokes and you're gone you're a goner yeah i'm too 
[00:16:30]  white yeah the privilege of being too white you got to stay out of some of these places they probably  thought you were a setup like this guy couldn't be oh yeah could be like a naked chick riding  through like somebody like this couldn't be happening because if you go through rape town you make a good  point because when you go through harlem you see a lot of like white people college kids the the  yuppie types that you know they want to do the right thing or whatever but where i was i was the  only one by far by far yeah by fucking far did anybody say anything or no i don't care no no no i wish

[00:28:30]  uh i recently heard that adam savage from miss miss busters um was tweeting photos from uh  uh his iphone and the iphone has a built-in gps location and um some security experts grabbed  the pictures and they actually have the gps data located in the uh the exit data of the photo  itself right so they actually found out where he lived ah he didn't turn that shit off yeah uh he 
[00:29:00]  did eventually i thought it was brought to his attention but uh i know a good majority of you  guys have uh iphones too so you know if you want to you know what feature do you have to turn off for  that um that's actually uh you know when uh like it pops out after you do you want to use your  location you always click no for that it should be somewhere in the settings oh yeah i always turn  it off yeah yeah yeah yeah but when you upload a picture from your phone it's actually uploading  that data as well and not just the image itself yeah i don't know well there's like all the time 
[00:29:30]  the uh i think some of the uh facebook things when you upload them to facebook facebook kind of  compresses them down so it might can uh get rid of some of that data that's in there and i do  forensics for a living so i'm pretty good oh wow well i know i know when i'm tweeting you know you  have an option to you know uh check the box for location yeah yeah i didn't know about that when i  first started tweeting and actually eroc saved me he's like dude everything you're tweeting they know 
[00:30:00]  exactly where you're tweeting from yeah well that makes me slightly paranoid so i'll be  turning that that thing off creepy yeah but i didn't know at first see it's just some of the  shit it's just because you don't know right yeah and there's just tons and tons of security risks out  there like that people have fucking no idea out there like you know little things from updating  like uh you know java on your computer to just a little stupid setting in your phone that you just  don't know about right okay right on brother a little uh yeah yeah uh thank you let 
[00:30:30]  let's uh go back to the bed bugs too ivan in jersey had uh bed bugs ivan hey what's up  hey man how you doing yeah no i had them at one time they were uh pretty bad thing you they the  bites they leave on you they're they're welts and pretty hard to hide you know people stare at  them it's it was the worst thing i ever experienced um getting rid of them i had to throw like half  my furniture out um television they hide wherever there's heat they can uh live by um hot washing 
[00:31:00]  your clothes and hot like hot hot water you're constantly washing it over and over three loads  four loads over loads i wonder if it's worse than when i was living in buffalo and i was infested with  fleas infested something tells me it's worse yeah i don't know i never have fleas to have fleas 
[00:31:30]  jump up off a rug onto your ankles and bite you yeah i i know i've been there and then if you're  laying down on a bed now they're biting your arms and oh my god i'm getting itchy thinking about it  oh we're learning so i'm so this doesn't happen to us he be jeebie ish with bugs and then you asked  a question you got an answer thank you sir yes david on long island david tell anthony what up david  what up david all right so you know how you guys are talking about relationships with the pictures  and all that bullshit sure i used to date this girl date used to keyword um got so bad that you know 
[00:32:00]  with the trust because you know i'm a great guy i don't understand why the hell she wouldn't trust me  you know but whatever uh she wanted a video better yet than pictures an actual live video  oh shit the clock not not a microwave it had to be like you know one of the actual like  analog clocks where you see the hand wow yeah real trusting oh it was it was the best relationship i 
[00:32:30]  was ever in you know she was a winner must have been a reason you're probably a scumbag  what'd you do that made her fucking do this got caught with stinky dick i really didn't do  anything on purpose you know she just fell on your cock yeah yeah yeah it was just you know  unpleasing she tripped on the sidewalk and headfirst running through dick things like facetime also like  if if you just get called for facetime and don't answer it's like well why didn't you answer right 
[00:33:00]  where are you well the best is we both have verizon phones and if you have a verizon phone  it tells you if the other person received the message and or opened it  it looks like you have some things to hide there's a lot of shit going on these days i think i got  nailed the other day with a fucking uh red light cam i've never gotten nailed by a red light cam and i 
[00:33:30]  think i got one uh i was waiting to make a left turn uh i was in a left turn little left turn lane  and the light's green but there's some oncoming traffic and the car in front of me in the left  turn lane is stopped at the line this is something that infuriates me also in the light screen  get in the middle you get in the middle right that way maybe two cars can make it through when  it turns fucking yellow think of others stupid son of a fuck right they don't know to pull out in the 
[00:34:00]  middle of the fucking intersection i agree and then make the turn oh they just sit there and wait  behind the line jimmy it infuriates me i know because as long as you're past that line you're  safe from stupid traffic cams yeah exactly and then they go as it turns red they go when it turns  red and i was just like fuck this i nailed it i made the turn and i just see funk i see a flash  come from a pole like and i look at it and there's a whole rig of cameras and shit and i'm like  motherfucker they got me and these assholes are putting up more and more cameras in manhattan 
[00:34:30]  more and more and this is nothing worse than that flash you feel like you're at a premiere  in hollywood in the 1930s or 40s or something this is out by me too so it wasn't even oh it's a long  island yeah they're starting that island starting that shit and that motherfucker is is the one to  blame yeah and when i saw i wanted to ram the back of his car i because i made the turn i'm right  behind him now as he's doing five miles an hour oh you cunts get off the road you ever bump someone 
[00:35:00]  else's car uh yeah a couple of times yeah you got to trade a little paint a little bit yeah  sometimes especially when your lease is up and it doesn't matter yeah yeah oh what there's no car  drives better than one that is a lease that's almost up right because not no car has better  acceleration can take more abuse let's say hi to danny works at a hotel danny you're going to tell us  what to look for in hotel rooms hey good morning boys what's up happy birthday jimmy 
[00:35:30]  run through everything run through everything  you're wrapping yourself in that disease cloth that is not a good idea i know there's a joke  oh good because they watch those things maybe once a quarter  once four times a year the things they watched that was a better way of saying once a quarter yeah  hence hence my joke  listen don't ever drink out of the drinking glasses don't ever use the coffee mugs if there's 
[00:36:00]  ever uh the dust ruffles on the bed do your best not to lift those things up because vacuums just  don't ever get under there you find a lot of shit there and one of the things with bed bugs that  they're doing now to combat it is they've got um they've got bloodhound dogs that go from room to  room that really have a sensitive nose and they can sense dried blood on the mattresses you think  a hotel owner is getting a fucking dog to go from room to room no i've done it i've done it maybe once 
[00:36:30]  a decade and what shitty hotels are you talking about that uh have the what the cups out and the  little coffee maker yeah you gotta smell for bad breath when you when you grab one of those cups  why not the coffee mugs i like my in room coffee sometimes  they do the same thing with the mugs that they do with the glasses they just take a dirty rag and  just wipe the oh my god you call you order room service so you get shit out of the mini bar 
[00:37:00]  that's true that's it all right thank you sir you got it you know bobby big rigger is right if  there are women out there that are making you take pictures i was thinking this and you know  what we're gonna go with this fuck it uh they're making you go all right where are you take a  picture yeah bobby's got the answer go ahead bobby what's going on there gentlemen i like your idea  i was thinking the exact same thing go ahead all right being a truck driver yeah i travel a lot 
[00:37:30]  i take a lot of pictures with my phone take a couple pictures put your face in it nice little  background of places where you normally go to right on your phone yeah fuck that bitch and if  if she's gonna play that game with you then guess what it's an arms race then you gotta do some  shit hey you gotta figure some shit start taking a whole bunch of pictures having a little file  on your phone and right depending on the time of day like i think i can match this one up right  now match this right yeah that's the one i'll send and then you're just all alone happy little 
[00:38:00]  place everything's fine there you go meanwhile you balls deep but that one guy was hold on that  one guy though was really fucked because she she wanted time stamp time stamps yeah nah screw that  shit i don't know how you get around time that's a little rough yes bobby yeah you're talking about  the uh traffic cams and stuff try pulling a 53 foot trailer behind you every intersection you go  through you get nailed halfway between a light oh we're flashing flashing lights when i'm going 
[00:38:30]  through cities and shit so yeah how does that how does that work at i don't know i i guess they'd  have to look at the picture and see if the guys you know yeah oh really and they'll do the right  thing yeah sure sure a lot of times with me they'll wind up getting the side of the trailer they won't  even get the tail of the trailer oh yeah okay if they don't have your plate i i can't wait to get the  ticket actually because they do send a picture of your plate and a picture of your face through the  windshield and i want that to be my facebook picture oh nice it's my fucking angry because 
[00:39:00]  all you're gonna see is me probably screaming yelling mad at the guy that fucking didn't pull  out in the intersection i can't wait to see you tweet that yeah i'll have to tweet that picture  and then so there was a rumor um i gotta keep it vague but someone i know said that um you could  spray paint your license plate or put some kind of with some kind of reflective shit or something and  then but then i'm hearing that doesn't work no because it fucks up the camera or something so  they can't get your plate does anyone know about this the person i i've talked to said turns out it 
[00:39:30]  doesn't work mythbusters did a thing about oh they did yeah yeah what is it is it a spray well yeah  there was i think hairspray was one of them i think clear nail polish was another one and it fucks up  the camera it's supposed to like you know the the rumor is like uh the glare will make the plate  impossible to read right right it's bullshit no it is bullshit they said uh what i'll find it i'll  pull it up for you wait what does myth buster do at the end i forgot hey guys what do they call it 
[00:40:00]  when it fails busted oh busted thank you jesus christ it's myth busted yeah hey guys a little piece of  well-placed uh black electrical tape you can make letters look like uh different letters and yeah  that's always great when you're fucking uh pulled over yeah i'm sure the fucking trooper appreciates  that you need that on all the time goofing with you and messed around with you i used to do that  with the uh how is how am i driving on the back of my uh air conditioning oh you did yeah i'd put  electrical tape on there and change the whole fucking thing around so if someone reported me the 
[00:40:30]  numbers were all wrong somebody in fucking muskogee is getting fucked because i'm driving like an  asshole you gotta do what you gotta do yeah get the bumper sticker says 1-800 go fuck yourself  whoa what year is this bobby what do you what for now on when i see your name i will be passing  sorry bailing out yeah it's too late sir slithering out slithering out is right you're just jackknife  that's a good start 1-800 i know why don't you just put the 1-800 go fuck yourself 
[00:41:00]  next to my shit happens bumper sticker  come on it reminds me of my uh my sign it says ool and they said there's no pee in this pool  so please please feel free to shit off the diving board it's a better one it's a better one i like i  don't swim in your toilet don't pee in my pool i've never seen that one oh yes next to the no 
[00:41:30]  horse play one the government wants to know where you are horse and where you're going man it's the  government man i guess they want to follow certain people sure yeah uh the average person like you and  i they don't fuck where we are but then they do things like you know check uh google earth for  illegal pools oh yeah well that will drive you fucking nuts so you know at some point they're  going to use some of this technology to catch you doing something that you are doing that is 
[00:42:00]  innocent enough but uh you know god they just yeah they'll figure out a way to give you uh speeding  tickets with that easy pass shit i'm convinced of that i heard that uh during the daytime not so much  at night but during the daytime they were doing an experiment with uh aircraft to look at cars  that are weaving too much down the road so a cop that's down the road a little piece can check the  car and see if the person's texting or on the cell phone okay because you kind of tend to weave a 
[00:42:30]  little bit more all right and i would just be laughing like i wasn't texting i'm drunk you idiot  motherfucker i like that because i know i could text and drive but do you ever kind of  probably use the entire lane a little too much but we've all seen that one idiot that is completely  clueless that they're even in a car anymore yeah it's like really it's all a game of how many letters  you can get before you have to look up dude two can i fit this word in two hands through the steering 
[00:43:00]  wheel and put that fucker right right in front of you but you still got it if you're looking you're  still looking down and texting well i don't want to have my phone up because then people give you  like shit fuck who gives a shit and if a cop sees it you're fucked i i'll look two hands in front of  me almost almost windshield level no i'll kind of look down oh and down wow down and to the right a  little so my peripheral will still look out the windshield no you're old school yeah it is a 
[00:43:30]  dangerous ass thing to do like i said i i've driven um probably when i shouldn't have and it  is safer than texting and it is safer than driving tired i'm not saying you know you should do it no  just saying by the way dan north carolina to add to the myth uh busters episode uh the only thing  that beat the camera was a jet car going 700 miles an hour is that true did they do that speed will 
[00:44:00]  beat a camera how did they do that but they had to get up to 700 miles to fucking beat the camera  that's crazy 700 miles an hour is one of those fucking record breaking that's it's almost the  speed of sound who would want to get to work that fast fuck that uh that's the trouble though you're  never going that fast really when you go through those it's usually a uh you know you're just taken  off from uh a yellow light right you want to squeak through it wasn't that fast by the way it says  the myth busters obtained a race car dubbed the beast which used a jet engine that could propel 
[00:44:30]  it to speeds up to 300 miles per hour okay so what did they just get a picture of the beast hit 245  miles per hour and managed to pass the camera so fast that it never took a picture okay that's  fantastic i gotta remember that matt really fast yo guys how's it going all right i just wanted to add  that trucker guy it's a good idea but i mean any if anyone knows what they're looking at on a picture  you could see what time and date it was taken yeah we didn't think of that yeah but i think 
[00:45:00]  most of the women are too stupid to figure that shit out oh yeah yeah we all know that i don't  know you'd be surprised they're stupid in some categories another joke jesus fucking christ literal  caller unplug them thank you man i'm gonna cut the cord they've blown it they blew it why don't we take a  break can i can i say by the way how clean my apartment is thanks to the ocd psychopath that was  there for fucking five and a half hours yesterday uh who helped she's nuts dude how about you fucking 
[00:45:30]  give me some i'm telling you all right she's crazy really she's crazy but she's great you got a  lunatic yeah i went to court yesterday she's great you think she has ocd she's nuts i love fucking nuts  one of the things i do with my money is i make sure i have a nice clean house i i had a cleaning lady  that all of a sudden had to fucking skip town and go to mexico under very fucking shady circumstances  it left her cell phone behind even i'm like what is this about so i got this new one and then jimmy's  like i need a cleaning lady i'm like well honestly she's only cleaned my place twice but it it it looks 
[00:46:00]  fucking sparkles huh but then we were suspicious that she might have some kind of ocd thing because  she lines up everything and oh so so i go jimmy you can call her but i can't i can't really you know  totally back her because i don't know her well enough yet don't know her won't vouch for her he goes  you might be he goes you'll be looking for stuff he goes you're gonna be looking for stuff because  she moves everything and straightens it up yeah she decides that stuff needs to be in drawers and  this has to be over there my apartment looked like a completely different apartment by the time she 
[00:46:30]  was done so i've spent the last two and a half days preparing for her arrival by doing stuff to get it  out of the way because i had to be done anyway so it was an excuse to clean up because it was getting  very cluttered yeah and then she came and i was made sure she did it in the afternoon when i was home  she's in my fucking closet moving my autographed gloves around boxing gloves and i'm like no  no what was she doing in there straightening them up but she wound up getting stuff and putting it in  the closet she's crazy but she's she fucking went into every cabinet yeah and uh for hours yeah man but 
[00:47:00]  it's completely neat now the apartment is different my girlfriend was like what the fuck happened it  looks great you feel guilty though because she's there way longer than you want her yeah that means  she must hate her own place and this is just a nice air-conditioned apartment yeah a place to hang  out yeah she's just clean and quietly cd too huh she's nuts there was a i have a glass cabinet and  there's a red cup in each one my girlfriend's like look at that i'm like she's a kook but she's very  good yeah yeah wow all right you like her then dude it's fucking she's a psychopath she comes over 
[00:47:30]  today yeah she's probably already there waiting outside she can't wait to get her lines up the  bed bugs she just can't wait to dig in right but when i told her i didn't want the in the closets  fixed i don't like the inside of my closet that's good driving nuts she's gonna she's gonna go into  those closets no but i told her herself she knows not to it i'm like not this one she's no no i know  no i won't go in there she's nuts yeah you think she's crazy i think she's got ocd for sure 
[00:48:00]  yeah she was recommended to me by someone in the building i live in but did you see all the  stuff that hangs from her yeah she has a bunch of towels she puts all her cleaning supplies around  around like a fucking old west like it's a tool belt and she just goes around and picks the the  spray needed for the job i should have taken before and after pictures i can't believe how much clutter  i had yeah i should have done the same man she's good though yeah all right good i'm very like i said  i can't really vouch for her yet she's only done my place two or three times watch her 
[00:48:30]  my girlfriend's throat one night real lunatic and let me in your closet i'm trying to think of  all the stuff she's done for us already she's good just rearrange things yeah but i mean i i was i  was she likes to push things toward walls oh everything's got to be against the walls has  to be touching something i think that might be her ocd oh maybe everything has to touch something  who if it's clutter yeah not the ground it has to be touching walls what a kook or the back of 
[00:49:00]  cabinets she was nice though and she got she didn't push it when i told her i didn't want certain  things done no it's good she knew you have a lot of clutter though i haven't been there in a while but  not as bad as you were it was bad it was poor use of closet space which keith and his wife  humiliatingly pointed out as they laughed and stabbed cell phone pictures of my closet i got  one of those pictures the ones with your plastic boxes with your electrical cords in them i know and  i market electrical cords i didn't realize why they're stacked up in his closet with electrical cords

[00:59:30]  and they always say if you have one or two that means there there's lots in the hiding somewhere  the occasional roach you can't kill a guy for but when it's an infestation of mice oh yeah yeah it  means little mice were being hatched in your apartment i listened to you because i thought  i had one stupid mouse and i i at first i thought it was kind of cool i really did it's like oh there's  that mouse that's kind of cool i was ready to start leaving food out for it against one stray mouse that  got stuck in my apartment and then jimmy was the one that woke me up he goes dude if you have one that 
[01:00:00]  means you're infested that means that this there's not enough room for him to live behind the walls  anymore so they're they're starting to push into your environment this is the most gbgb show i've  ever been on and man was jimmy right when i got those electric traps from a fine listener and started  fucking executing mice holy shit fucking electrocution traps and then and this is the sickness do we make  the interns touch the contacts or than oh yeah yeah and touch the absolutely he was fucking did we 
[01:00:30]  have a trivia contest where in order to buzz in you had to electrocute yourself yeah it was awesome  i love that bit uh lawyers lawyers but here's the sickness and i think i i bring this up because i  think people could relate to this so now i leave this apartment where i was killing mice on a daily  basis i would get bummed some mornings when i didn't see that light flashing meaning i didn't  get one overnight and then i move i finally buy a place that i haven't seen a mouse a cockroach a bed 
[01:01:00]  bug nothing in in three years now but when i first moved there there was a sadness that i wasn't killing  mice anymore you're like a serial killer that stops killing is that normal you're going around just  killing little animals because it becomes part of your life or something a thing it's a thing it's  a thing i was sort of i was sort of sad at first not anymore i could care less and also got got  sad when i didn't have to deal with um uh parking my car every day yeah on the street because that 
[01:01:30]  because that that was a challenge in a game that sucked in brooklyn it sucked but then when i got a  garage i kind of missed it for a little while did you is that weird yes a little bit yeah it is yeah  yeah that's weird because i there is nothing worse alternate as far as driving goes than alternate  side yeah where you have to wait it out with everybody else and just get but i like going up  and down the streets and all of a sudden someone pulled out i was like yes i win i'd park at hydrants  and crosswalks just just to eat the ticket i'll be like you know what fuck it i'm eating it because 
[01:02:00]  i'm not going to sit here for an hour sometimes driving around the block so you could park four blocks  away and walk to your fucking house it was just a pain in the ass one whole side of the street is  fucking just empty but you can't park there and you know what that's about too right extortion  yeah yeah the city extorting money from you it's the city making an excuse they need to keep the  streets clean but they really want to you know catch you fucking yeah parking illegally napping so 
[01:02:30]  they can give you tickets that's all that's about what they do they pay a guy that you know because  they have to make it look like they are clean you ever see the street sweepers go by are they  really doing anything no they're just pushing the fucking garbage to the other side of the street  they make mud yeah make it they turn the dirt into mud that just comes out the back it's all  horseshit that's all all these little fucking things they say that they need to do to keep the  city clean it's horseshit have you noticed it's ways to catch you they're cutting the budget on a lot 
[01:03:00]  of things in new york and i've started to notice things like that it's like the sims when you take  uh a few of the like sim sim amusement park when you take some of the custodians away and the  janitors and the people start getting mad because the sidewalks get garbage on them uh i have noticed  not as many street sweepers and uh there used to be this machine that would scrub the inside of the  fucking tunnels you ever see that thing it's like this fucking got brushes and it's cleaning the  tile walls and it's pretty fucking cool actually to see i was behind it once i haven't seen that 
[01:03:30]  all these years probably eight months i used to see it a lot every morning when i drive through  it was a pain in the ass sometimes you'd be like ah this fucking thing's taking up a lane yeah because  you're coming in right when they yeah do that now they've i think they've just parked that fucking  thing too much money that's it now the tunnel walls are turning black with soot it's a crime what  the politicians have done to uh to weed the people in this city especially the fucking they decided  they don't have a budget for pothole repair i i can't even imagine how damaged kenny's car is at 
[01:04:00]  this point our road jimmy knows going up that hill it's unbelievable i don't even know where the road  is anymore and this is a street in new york city yeah try paying fifteen hundred dollars for a  tire on an escalade fifteen hundred bucks for one rim and one tire because i slammed the fucking pothole  and drove around for a week not knowing until i saw it one day i was like holy shit the rim was  cracked right where the bead of the tire goes in just fucking cracked a chunk yeah right out of it 
[01:04:30]  and the sidewall of the tire was split and i'm like i've been doing 90 for a week on that tire  wow that's it's frightening that could have been really bad oh could have been but they're just not  taking care of the people anymore because they don't know how to fucking you know handle a budget  yeah properly everyone's fucking just crying poverty and yeah but we're doing our job we're  paying our fucking taxes yeah they don't care we don't have a choice they're not they're giving 
[01:05:00]  themselves raises but to see that they they have choices well so they're like you know what we can't  fix the potholes this year we don't have enough money in our budget well guess what i don't have  enough money in my budget to pay my taxes pay you is that okay no see that's the problem yeah why  doesn't it work both ways i gotta cut my budget i was looking at my bills and everything and  yeah i figured the taxes i'm gonna cut it there sorry city of uh new york i i yeah you know i  can't give you as much right now that's what they do to us i know good luck with that though  yeah yeah be the guy that gets that started really you know what you're right though you're right 
[01:05:30]  they fucking cut services and you can't cut what you're paying they keep raising yeah how do they  cut a dollar a nickel buys a dollar's worth wouldn't it make sense if they're cutting your services that  you should be able to cut a little from what you pay them yeah yep doesn't work that way the the mta  here in new york is all fucked up because they've they've cut service and raised prices so much that  they're losing money because people aren't taking their mass transit anymore they're figuring out i 
[01:06:00]  don't know what but they're figuring out alternate ways to get in maybe a lot more carpooling and things  like that but they're losing riders by raising the prices so it's not helping them well that's that's  the only way we can fight back and people are leaving because of the high taxes people just go  to jersey or somewhere else where they uh don't have to pay so much tax on their business so now  they might have to you know cater to us a little bit no they'll just raise the taxes on us more  yeah that's all they do yeah you're kind of right you know manny from the comedy show used to talk 
[01:06:30]  about this in bad times people raise their prices and he said it's so stupid it's a reaction it's an  instinct but he said that he keeps his prices the same or lowers them a little in horrible times and it  looks like you're gonna take a hit but more people come to you yeah yeah it sounds you make  more right yep you make it up in people don't think they're getting fucked yeah look at the  concert business oh dude it's bad for everyone it's arrowsmith but do you feel like sold out  maybe they fucked themselves by making the the tickets so so freaking expensive yeah when we were 
[01:07:00]  growing up we didn't have to choose which show we were going to you know what i mean and and that's  what people are doing nowadays they see the jones beach schedule let's say let's go with that  and they go wow i would love to go to these six shows but i can only afford two or three and  then they're picking and choosing which ones are more important to them yeah we didn't deal with  that growing up we went to every fucking show do you know i remember they priced themselves out of  the marketplace yep i remember my mother gave me her credit card to come to new york to to stay  overnight to see to get aussie tickets and i waited online all night where did you get blown i didn't i was 
[01:07:30]  i was younger i was like 17 maybe 16 and i was i was out in front of the garden i wait online i  finally got up there to get tickets because you're waiting because they were calling up different  lines yeah and i'll never forget this one guy waiting online this is like 84 he had a picture  of him and aussie and he kept holding it up to the people and they actually moved his line ahead  i was so mad i'm like he's not his friend he's here so i get up to the line and the credit card

[01:20:00]  we hit tom de turkey at two o'clock  can't wait for jay to do that bit oh yeah i don't know this is funny you're back to yesterday  jay was out of his mind oh is he out of his fucking mind  yoo-hoo i thought of it yoo-hoo  steven tyler signed on to do american idol  yeah i don't see this 62  yeah another thing is we've interviewed steven tyler over the years he's progressively gotten harder and harder to understand 
[01:20:30]  he he's like this kind of wacky um almost a david lee roth-ish thing going on with him where  they're talking just for the sake of saying something and and you listen and go what what is he talking about  what is he saying he likes skiddy doo yeah he's trying to like do the you know  just the skooly bop yeah he's why what are you what are you saying he answers everything with some skooly bop 
[01:21:00]  and then he tries to uh make some kind of analogy and and you just don't understand it and  everything's got to be too hip for the room thing but it well yeah the band's falling apart because  tmz has a great video today you might want to go there  does uh what would tyler durden do have it because i i don't like promoting tmz  i don't like doing that to the what would tyler durden do.com  it's pretty much joe perry hip checking steven tyler off the stage off the fucking stage and 
[01:21:30]  and it's obvious that he fucking hates steven tyler yes there's no other way to look at this  because they're on a little ramp yep i mean they've they've played enough shows where they know that  area is a little touch and go you got to be careful and he hip checks them right off the  stage it's that little strip that comes out into the crowd you know those things and the guys come  out on it and then they run back to the stage uh they're on that and joe perry's playing steven  tyler's kind of at the edge of the stage he bends over a little and uh joe perry kind of hip checks 
[01:22:00]  him right into on his ass and he flies into the crowd and that was basically fuck you really  really take a hike you're you're signing with american idol over over us great we'll take  this old man can i see that hip check young dan oh you guys i saw i saw him fall but i didn't  realize he was hip check by joe oh yeah look at this it's like an old tranny i know look at this  perry goes over and hits him he knew what he did yes he did he totally knew what he did there 
[01:22:30]  he looked behind him first to see where uh steven tyler was and then hit him and he fell off  into the crowd steven tyler yeah but then steven tyler is aware because then they get steven tyler  back up steven tyler gets back on stage yes and grabs joe perry by the jacket and swings him around  and then thought better of throwing him off the stage he was gonna he absolutely wanted to fling  him into the crowd oh yeah because tyler i mean i don't think he's stupid now they help grandpa back 
[01:23:00]  up on the stage there he goes hey man and he grabs joe perry and spin and then stops last second  throw him right into the crowd oh he was annoyed yeah very annoyed he no yeah yeah absolutely that  video is everywhere today check it out what the fuck joe perry needs to stop too though it's like  you know what i get how annoying that is just get a new singer then or quit or go somewhere else  yeah you're you're a you're fucking joe perry they just know it's there's fucking uh they got 
[01:23:30]  an atm right there yeah that's an atm the two of them playing so what the fuck are they doing but  they don't even need the money though it gets to a point you don't need the money they've been  selling out arenas for 30 years you don't need i mean you know it's like there's one thing with  negotiating contracts there's another one you do nothing but sell out arenas for 30 years  but what are you gonna do with the money i don't know they have a shitload of money just sitting in  fucking banks maybe buy more fucking steven tyler dresses like an old french woman maybe he wants 
[01:24:00]  to buy old french lady clothes french doesn't he this is hurtful i like steven tyler dude i do too  that's really exciting now i don't see him dream on oh it's well wonderful oh you don't like dream  you don't like aerosmith songs i prefer they're actually good i prefer dio's version of course with  but uh i like aerosmith i thought they were overrated but they are very good  uh i don't see him as a judge on american idol um who was he replacing i would i would say  by paula because they dress similar is it he's he's he's like the goofy one yeah like the goofy 
[01:24:30]  nice one he's gonna be the nice kind of kind of goofy and then they'll get some english uh guy in  there you think they're going to replace simon with an english guy they have to replace simon with  a serious person that knows singing criticizing singers whatever critical fucking now you would  think tyler would know singers i i not necessarily you know what i mean yeah yeah that well that's 
[01:25:00]  probably it you know they want somebody with some kind of musical knowledge but i'm just taking a  break for that sorry yes and i'm sorry now you should probably get somebody with musical knowledge  but i i think steven tyler is so out there it just it's not going to fit that mainstream america  i think american idol show i think they're in deep trouble yeah they really thought ellen  degeneres was going to do the job and no one cared that she was doing that i've been out of that  for fucking years now i'm all about america's got talent we're one week away from prince poppycock 
[01:25:30]  prince poppycock i could give a flying fuck and we're supposed to dress jimmy as prince poppycock i  didn't forget that oh yeah you see how what janine did after you said you didn't want to use her for  the makeup no she dressed herself up like prince poppycock well she called herself uh prince poppy  cunt yeah she did princess poppy yeah yeah that was clever proving that she could do the makeover for  you and turn you into prince poppycock prince poppy cunt so you're not digging the steven tyler on 
[01:26:00]  no i don't uh i'm not feeling it yo as they say i'm not feeling it should we go ann's walking down  the hall should we just continue then yeah we're not might as well all right oh this is politics  yes here here she comes politics i'm gonna go take a nap i'll see you guys at 8 30 oh well i'm tired  went to a show last night so i could it makes it fun i could use a nice nap what showed you go to  you guys enjoy you know this and wow i'll enjoy the legs though jesus christ legs for days i saw mgmt

[01:27:00]  who is that i don't know why they keep putting me on with this homeless woman and i said to the to  the producer could you get her resume why aren't you just bringing in a homeless person to debate  me because a homeless person does have more on the resume and i know liberals are chickens and they  won't they won't debate me so we're running out of options but still come on seriously was she  something someone you've never heard of tanya acker and no i do not know what community college she

[01:28:30]  some wine and then i had three beers and yeah it's not the mixing it's that you've had so much  alcohol yeah yeah it doesn't matter what you're drinking if you're drinking all day and all night  you're so are you coming to my um debate with james carville i hear about this uh i just heard about  it actually jimmy just like say that we just gave it a plan city yeah um wow now that's gonna be  you live in new jersey it's probably a short drive no i'm long island oh it's a mansion in long 
[01:29:00]  island but but atlantic city is my second home i do tend to go down there a few times the red eye  boys are coming are they yeah that's gonna i should that is gonna be a good one man uh you you've been  on shows with him before yeah yeah and uh what do you think of his um his whole style he tends to  lean left what do you think of his debating style uh he's a little i don't rough i think he is like 
[01:29:30]  the um robin williams of political commentary he talks fast so people think they're supposed to laugh  but nothing is funny for years wow i've said you gotta be funny yeah oh look at this my phone i'll  make it a tie that means nothing it's not funny and everyone's rolling going wow off the cuff he's  so funny stream of consciousness tell a joke for god's sake it's not funny and he's the same way 
[01:30:00]  yeah yeah and and he's really odd when before he shaved his head it was odd but now he's got that  slick like alien look to him he really looks like an alien he looks like they're gonna find like hooker  driver's licenses like in a little compartment in his house somewhere oh they were all missing  souvenirs yeah exactly little mementos he's not gonna try to punch you right  i don't think he'll pull the rick lazio move he seems like that type of guy if he gets frustrated  enough that he might like strangle a bitch yeah yeah i'd like to see that trust him uh what kind of 
[01:30:30]  what kind of subjects do you think you two are gonna you know i have no idea it's a one hour debate  i'm i mean it's atlantic city so i'm sure it's supposed to be fun presumably the election i'm sure  yeah the election of course all i will be talking about is the mosque because i am so enjoying the  position the democrats have decided to take yes it's fantastic when you watch it and go what what  are they thinking it's although harry harry reid and i think howard dean i was surprised actually  said it was i think i was actually very surprised he's trying so hard to not lose his job all he does 
[01:31:00]  is say ethnic things yeah yeah the fucking he's the puerto ricans the blacks he's like offended two big  groups are ready and now it's like the muslims all right you get in with them too fuck yourself  everybody who's kind of like harry reid hates everyone it's uh it is looking grim and they just the  democrats keep like really tripping up uh more and more as november comes around yeah yeah i think  the problem is when your entire um you know advisor squad came from zay bars now that you're not 
[01:31:30]  gonna get you know the pulse of the american people no no mosque at ground zero that's fine  they are so out of touch with what the people are feeling and thinking they go completely against it  and think that they're they're patting each other on the back like yeah look at what we're doing yes  we're changing the country we're but yeah it's a whole new era of of what the the country hating  what you're doing to it it's astounding me i like i say this i'm surprised david patterson took the 
[01:32:00]  position he did which is i actually i'm pleasantly surprised with david patterson who was i saying  look let's get this out we'll meet find a better place for it you know do you think um nobody told  him he was talking to a ruler but i mean the fact was he still made an effort no one heard him say it  no that that was good i think that's why the new york times kept attacking patterson as far as the  democrats go he's actually fairly reasonable yeah yeah but you know i just i want to have a seminar to 
[01:32:30]  teach democrats what courage is because both bloomberg and obama you know they were advised  oh this is going to be so brave you're going to be so good stand in front of a group of muslims  and tell them at the ramadan dinner no less tell them you want a mosque at ground zero so he gets  a standing ovation he brags about the standing ovation and then five minutes later oh i wasn't  saying anything about the no no that wasn't the mosque no i didn't say it i wasn't talking about it i 
[01:33:00]  didn't say so the first time we get cowardice masquerading as courage and the second time we  get cowardice masquerading as principle yeah yeah but it's still cowardice you think he's afraid of  of of uh muslims not liking him or of appearing islamophobic like obama is he is he afraid of  appearing like that he's that he's uh against islam or is he actually just afraid of uh  actually being you're just doing i'm saying is he i do but i don't even think it gets to that level  of i seriously if we go and i would so recommend this as a little field trip for your radio show 
[01:33:30]  send oh jim you'd be good at this you got to send a man on the street and just just start asking people  questions at zay bars and i'm telling you they will all say oh no i think a mosque at ground zero is  fine yeah you are dealing with crazy people it's like they're like acl yours and timothy dolan came  out again i was also surprised that the uh he's the archbishop i think in new york came out and said  that he thinks he talked about the convent by what auschwitz yeah and sometimes you have to the pope 
[01:34:00]  stepped in how about one islamic leader step in and go we understand we have the legal right but it's  in poor taste oh let's be sensitive you're a crazy person you know how what a long way that would go  sounds way too logical you're right it does sound logical and it won't happen it really does any time that  question has been posed to any muslims that i've seen on the news and the chat shows and everything  else this morning they will avoid that they will instantly turn to the legal right of religion and  how it's in the constitution of freedom of religion and it's like we know no one's denying the fact that 
[01:34:30]  you can do it yes the the thing people are upset with is the fact that you are doing it there's a  difference we were watching this morning and you actually pointed out the guy was they asked him about  like uh putting it there and being in poor taste and he just avoided the question avoided it yeah  and and went to legal it's like no one's questioning your legal right we know you have the right that's  why it would be a nice thing for you not to do but that's their answer to it and no one's arguing that  point they're answering the thing no one cares about we understand our constitution we understand 
[01:35:00]  that there is a right for them to build the thing there but why are you doing it don't you understand  it's insensitive well the founding fathers wouldn't have thought insensitive all right here he goes  again i just don't understand you could also legally put a dildo fucking factory there but you  don't you don't want to do that yes you know obama and i said this yesterday the problem with obama  is is liberals don't think that he's because they're really they're closet racist a lot of them 
[01:35:30]  he's an elitist and he's an intellectual snob and they don't think that a black guy can be a snob  he is he is an elitist guy he thinks in an elitist way that's not realistic that's not being  in touch with the american people everyone's against it and he's so surrounded by the people  that are exactly like that yes i could just imagine him and pelosi and ever just patting  themselves on the back on we're doing things we're changing the not looking at the public going  stop it what are you doing to us i like nancy pelosi i can't even joke 
[01:36:00]  i couldn't even say it and finish well now she uh she suggested now we saw us on the news today that  uh she suggested that we start looking into people that are uh against the mosque and where this money  is coming from oh yeah no they want to send all of us to guantanamo yeah yeah yeah that just set  all the um combatants the enemy combatants free and put people that are maybe contributing a little  money to the other side uh in guantanamo it really does amaze me the uh stupidity that goes on and the 
[01:36:30]  elitism and on on the uh left it's it's amazing yeah yeah there's no one in the room to say no not  yeah what not a good idea what are you doing how radically left is carvel carvel i always say his name  carvel i know i always do that um creepy face james we'll call him how is he really because he  seems like a bright guy he's not a dumb guy i mean how far left is i can't tell because i can never 
[01:37:00]  understand what he's saying so who knows what do you guys do what you're talking about  what did you just say by the way if you look up transcripts on nexus more than anyone else who  is ever a guest on tv unintelligible that's great do you actually look up transcripts that's what we  need to do we don't do our homework with anything knee jerk you want to go through transcripts 
[01:37:30]  did you uh watch keith overman's mosque thing the special comment yeah i love when he does his  special comment of course i linked to it on my web page it was it was i i set the t-bone machine for  that one it's you realize it's on youtube and you you can't even fucking comment on his piece  he's got a disabled comment disabled comment on an issue where everyone has a lot to say  he's a douchebag yeah exactly and that whole mosque issue i mean i was watching that special comment 
[01:38:00]  thinking the mosque at ground zero it's like we've designed a pompous douchebag trap and you know  you call the pompous douchebag um exterminator over and he lays out the glue traps okay we're gonna put  a mosque at ground zero and right wingers are against it and you wake up in the morning and  oh look who's stuck in the glue it's keith overman it's the pompous douchebag trap  it's amazing how people come out and they there's a great article in the post today about uh some some 
[01:38:30]  editorial about how if you would it's just nothing has happened there nothing has been  built it's an embarrassment nine years later yeah and it's fucking nothing and they blame me a lot  of them are blaming pataki saying that whole contest but that was already 2006 yeah now that  was a few years back a ways also uh on on september 12th 2001 do you honestly think if you went out and  asked anybody should we build a mod like the rubble is still smoking do you honestly think people would  be like yeah we should be tolerant to the muslim how do people just forget the the horror of that 
[01:39:00]  day right of the 11th and think that on the 12th people would feel any better right right or years  later and by the way you remind me from keith from the pompous douchebag special comment one hilarious  moment of it was when he indignantly points out that no one has done anything with this building since  2001 and then and then you know sort of sort of slips in because it was destroyed in the crash 
[01:39:30]  in the attack on the world trade center some of the plane fell through the building he just slips that  in incidentally like you're not going to notice yeah oh it's not really that close to the site  really it was hit by the plane yeah dunce i can't stand listening to uh him ranting on this  uh john stewart's another one who on on the daily show he just started talking about and really 
[01:40:00]  bashing uh the republicans stance on this thing and getting behind the liberals that you know uh  this is uh constitution again says that he should be able to build this blah blah blah uh how about we  go back to uh september 11th and the the weeks after when on his show where he's just weeping  weeping on his show crying about what happened to the towers right and apparently he forgot too i got  everyone just forgets not everyone no no i have not forgotten i have such disdain for uh uh for the 
[01:40:30]  religion itself i'm sorry whenever i hear this is a peaceful religion that is being marred by this  islamic extremist i've not seen any of the peaceful part i'm sorry come out show me be be a vocal against  what's going on be peaceful let me see that it's not this archaic uh prehistoric religion based on 
[01:41:00]  on violence and uh uh misogyny but it they don't i don't see that part of it right and where is it  they keep attacking you have fort hood you have the diaper bomber you have the snipers down in dc you  have the times square bomber i mean just you know off the top of your head these are more attacks on  u.s soil since 9-11 although i do note there were none between when we invaded iraq and obama became  president right that's pretty amazing no attacks on u.s soil yeah yeah yeah well it's also um 
[01:41:30]  oh fuck i forgot i looked i completely blanked like my mind i had a thought that completely went  away that's because she smells good she does smell good but it was something about i think ground zero  oh how about that you know they're gonna put a mosque down there i just reset that's what happened i just  reset oh and on my twitter we got this guy sax god he he's for the mosque and he's every time we 
[01:42:00]  mentioned the mosque he's all over twitter his uh recent comment here is the reason they are building  it there is because it's close to close for all the new york city muslims to go to so is that good  enough for you guys no it's not no no it's not nobody lives down there what is he talking about yes  close for the well you know what how about you you build it somewhere else and then all those muslims  that have to walk or drive a little further to get there can use that time to reflect on the 
[01:42:30]  atrocities that were committed where that mosque was where they thought it should be it actually was  a great place for 19 of them to converge nine years ago i what i was going to say is oh this is  part of me you always hear like how we don't understand islam we have to reach out to islam but  it's like they don't understand americans either it's like we're suckers if you're nice to us and if  they if they would voluntarily move this if one right vocal member in the islamic world would go  you know what we really people would go fuck man these are not as unreasonable it would be like it's 
[01:43:00]  like when someone like holds the door for you you go son of a bitch i can't believe i didn't like that  guy we're easy americans are easy yeah just don't be such a hamas came out for it they should have just  walked away and said i know hamas is but hamas is backing it yeah that's not that has donated a  members only jacket to go in the lobby let's get someone from the other side because we're on  we're all on one side here in studio today jim in boston what's up yeah i want to preface my 
[01:43:30]  statement number one i don't want you to beat up on me number two i'm not a i'm not a religious guy  i'm uh far from it um but help me out here a little bit okay first of all um i have a little  bit of a problem uh tying those fuckers who went into the towers and your mainstream muslim guy  because i compare it to your regular christian guy who goes to church every day but then you've got 
[01:44:00]  like the kkk who claim they're christians and all that now i i just find a hard time connecting the  two and and because i have a hard time with that i say to myself well if you do build a mosque  next to you know that area i don't i don't know new york that well but close to these uh towers  i say to myself well if they're the mainstream muslims or islamists whatever you want to call 
[01:44:30]  them i don't see how that's a big difference you know i don't see how that's i wouldn't call that  offensive because if they're just mainstream people they could be just like christians and  then there's kkk crazies you know it's it's an it's a sensitivity issue it's a it's a rub it in  your face issue as i see also uh there are a lot of victims and victims families and uh first responders  and and people that have been affected um for the rest of their lives that don't want this there 
[01:45:00]  so let me let me ask you right there so basically what there is is there's an undercurrent of real  if you think about it uh racism or prejudice but no no i don't think that's right and just a little  side note here the kkk today is entirely composed of fbi informants um and they're not they're not  you know committing their they never were let's go back 100 years in america they weren't you know 
[01:45:30]  citing the lord's prayer as they were burning a cross or lynching a black these guys were you know  shouting ala akbar when when that dr hassan stood up at fort hood and and guns down our troops he's  shouting out ala akbar the terrorists are doing it in the name of religion and and yeah okay they're  they're peaceful muslims and they aren't the same ones but this is there are a lot of them who aren't  peaceful and they're using the religion specifically as part of the violence okay so in that case i'm 
[01:46:00]  going to just make a humorous comment that's always a very natural way to set up a joke by the way  humorous comment semi-colon get out of the way here comes the funny here comes the funny  let me ease into it we have a mosque at the white house the pentagon all the time we should have three  400 of them all over the city so they won't blow up the most critical areas in our country no because  the only people that will blow up mosques are islamic extremists right they'll go in they'll gun 
[01:46:30]  down people we have to sit there and uh pay attention to rules of engagement where if uh enemy  combatants run into a mosque we can't even look at the mosque never mind bomb it or shoot at it yet  they will go in and hack their people to uh pieces in the name of allah i know you see it you see it i  mean you see the suicide bombers in iraq and and the crazy shit they're killing their own people when  they do stuff like that so i understand your point but i just thank you for the clarification i just uh 
[01:47:00]  i don't like to i i just see religion in general most religions if you look at the way they're written  they're quite they're quite peaceful i mean you look at christianity you go with the ten commandments  you're doing okay but it's the people who teach the religions who screw everything up it's a lot  of religions uh if you if you do read the ancient texts are very violent they have um this uh undertone  of of everything should be done for god not for your personal interest and there are things like 
[01:47:30]  stonings beheadings a lot of smitings a lot of people being i like the smiting oh who doesn't love to  be smiting smiting it did but but what i'm saying is uh in in the modern world these religions have  been updated for the time you can't you know stone people i'm sorry but you know it is even more than  that there is of the three major world religions only one of them was founded by a warrior 
[01:48:00]  which was um that's islam yes right right yeah i mean christianity is purely peaceful and the old  testament well okay god is being a gracious god he's trying to keep the jews alive in the desert  um gives them all these rules okay it may not apply today and there was a lot of warfare going on but  it's not like moses was admired for slaughtering infidels  yes have they polled uh muslims on this whole thing no i don't know that'd be interesting if 
[01:48:30]  they posed polled american muslims american muslims and where where would the percentages  they probably don't even poll them because they're afraid of being looked at as anti-muslim but  people don't talk to them don't poll them people say like wow jesus am i a mind reader wow what is  president obama's religion oh that's something else okay a lot of people think that uh obama is a  muslim 18 percent 43 they don't know and that's the highest well the weird thing is they didn't 
[01:49:00]  even give the correct answer as one of the options atheist yeah yeah maybe he is atheist so totally  all liberals are so here's here's a name for you nancy pelosi she's in the news today yeah yeah do you  think it's her sex appeal that keeps her in the limelight she is a pisser she's like four characters in  the fucking creep show we're not gonna get a lot of phone calls but this guy goes uh wants to ask 
[01:49:30]  ann how much she would like to swing a sledgehammer in nancy pelosi's face her big gavel her dumb gavel  she walked down the street with that question i actually kind of like her because she gives you  the democratic position without the nonsense okay just tell us the truth we're gonna check in with  nancy pelosi she wants to investigate people who are opposed to the mosque yes you know they're all  secretly thinking that but only the congresswoman from san francisco can come out and say what all  democrats are thinking yeah she said she would like to investigate where this funding is coming from 
[01:50:00]  for this grand conspiracy of people that are against the mosque yeah who's paying you yeah i well you  know i can't tell you i don't want pelosi finding out uh where all this money is coming from  the borgata how about yeah how how about the uh image of the towers being um it being hit by planes  and collapsing is what people are are thinking about not not this conspiracy not money coming in not this 
[01:50:30]  grand plot to get the democrats out it's not they believe me they were tripping over their own  dicks before this happened and then they come up with this and obama can't keep his mouth shut on it  now pelosi comes out and she's again now oh who's behind this it's got to be someone and she said  in response because they want to find out who's funding the mosque they want to see if it's iran or  they want to find out and she said well while because she's for that investigation but she's like  well while we're investigating we should check out who's funding the opposition well all right well 
[01:51:00]  how about you narrow it down who shouldn't we investigate asshole because you fall on one of those  sides you either are funding it or you're not funding it you should absolutely look into who where  some of this money is coming from trace it back see if it's coming from terrorist organizations or  or saudi arabia which is just a synonym for what you said exactly that but we kissed our ass that's  every president that's conservative that's liberal there's no president that cannot be in bed with  the saudis i'm so tired of a relationship when bush was holding hands in the garden in the in the 
[01:51:30]  humiliating romantic actually yeah i mean obama bowed and that was irritating but the hand-holding  thing too it's like why all of a sudden assimilate to that homoerotic culture that really annoyed me  yeah you know how much money you have to have to have a picture taken with the american president  hand-holding in a garden you gotta have a lot of dough it's a thousand bucks a plate at a shitty dinner  yeah that is uh embarrassing yeah but the pelosi calling for the investigation and then 
[01:52:00]  uh obama not being able to keep his mouth shut he couldn't keep his mouth shut he just couldn't  the best thing for him to do would have been not mention it at all and then all right then he comes  out and uh starts talking about the first responders uh health care oh yeah nowhere he hasn't mentioned  this in years he hasn't talked about it uh first responders you know are dying because they were down 
[01:52:30]  there breathing in all this i think those got paid now we're dealing with post-traumatic stress  syndrome from people who were generally in the area in the area is that what you think is going on  i think i think america responded pretty well to the first responders breathing in the debris up to  the eighth and ninth responders we're kind of down on the uh down on the totem pole a little there  now we're getting the people who watch it on cnn and we're upset i think it's pretty calculated 
[01:53:00]  though that after taking a beating on on his position on the mosque uh that he comes out now  and within a couple of days is like and we'll take care of the first responders well they were killing  him they said he's not addressing people who are down there talks about the mosque but doesn't talk  about taking care of these people and then he's like yes we'll take care of them please forget about  my mosque statements what do you think happens after the mosque is built i think people what's  gonna be the response people forget before we get to the mosque being built because these words will 
[01:53:30]  never again cross my lips bill o'reilly had a good point wow do you not you don't love o'reilly i  thought you guys were like i've never seen you on the show you don't it's kind of a love-hate  relationship sometimes i think he is so brilliant every man and sometimes as he knows i want to  strangle him but he had a really good point last night i think which was um you know they have to  do a lot of renovations because you know a plane fell on it um he said no construction worker is 
[01:54:00]  going to build that you are not going to get a construction which i thought that's actually a  pretty good point you get a nice union all-american construction worker you're going to get a team  building the mosque yeah hell fucking no i could see some shoddy workmanship going into that one  yeah all right a little ceiling collapse during their first gathering a very thin floor  bring in the uaw from from detroit you know the way you guys been building those cars  do it to the bot mosque what's your problem with bill o'reilly you know how i call uh oberman a 
[01:54:30]  douchebag i say the same thing about i don't like o'reilly either i don't like either guy  what's your what's your issue with him uh well there's no particular issue it's just sometimes  every once in a while he's just ridiculous and and when he's so when he can be really great  and then you're watching and if you care about politics there it is he's really hitting it hard  what did he come back on that he was i think the arizona law he just come back from vacation it was  like the best o'reilly ever and you're watching and you're totally intrigued and then we have 
[01:55:00]  culture warriors oh wait a second don't make me watch msnbc no what is culture warriors i don't  watch early what's culture warriors it's like name the third child on brady bunch is he just trying to  expand the audience a little bit or but he's got the numbers he doesn't need to right no i think  it's just easy he's been taking some heat for like doing anything on lindsey lohan you know if he  brings that up well he went after jennifer aniston right for what'd she do well because she's uh 
[01:55:30]  telling women they don't need a man to have a kid oh he was right about that he was very upset about  that no that was good no i like that but i don't like the silly things at the end sometimes i think  he'll take a stance too because he's been a little too far to one side so he takes the other stance just  so he doesn't take so much crap right i look and go he he really doesn't believe that but he's just  saying his instincts are so good he is i mean the whole the whole persona is completely accurate 
[01:56:00]  he and i love this about him this is the love side he is like the sort of woman guy who would  just like walk up to barbara walters at a cocktail party and ask her how old she is right and i love  that about him in an interview that he will just say the same thing that all of us are thinking  yeah yeah but might not ask yeah i've seen him do that a few times yeah i think gutfeld is the  smartest guy over there i really do gutfeld is a really underrated smart he's because he's funny 
[01:56:30]  but he's a really bright dude man uh gutfeld i think always has the best take on things even i don't  agree with him i think that's a smart take including the gay muslim bar oh that was brilliant  just put oh god put the gay bar i've been collecting names for the bar on my website  anncoulter.com you can look it up over there you with the computer yeah danny's got it right there  and there are some fantastic names coming and i think suspicious packages is the winning  i predict i i say that they any uh i kidding i could be an optimist asshole i don't think it's 
[01:57:00]  going to get built there i think it's going to get moved i don't know there's the developer saying  nope we're building it right here does the developer have an interest on selling the property  meaning um is it the developer's building i would gather like well then of course the developer's  going to say that's almost like if you're going to rent your apartment out and everyone's trying  to say no rent the apartment from them and you're like no one's rented this apartment in years  so the developer's just trying to make money i guess right i mean am i wrong about that 
[01:57:30]  so wouldn't the developer have a big interest in going they're never going to move  it's pretty cheap by the way yeah the whole building is like four million dollars really  that's what i heard yeah i guess this is going to take probably four million to renovate a few more  million you got to pull a landing gear out of the basement are that much in new york this is an  entire building i think they're going to move it when the governor's involved there's too many  howard dean there's too many prominent democrats even speaking i eventually i think it will they'll 
[01:58:00]  find a compromise they'll move it a couple blocks away they'll give them some kind of a tax break  something will happen yeah arabia just move it there please we got enough with these friggin silly  roofed looking things we got a first responder on the line here chris on long island chris  how you doing you guys gotta get that fucking hole out of the fucking office man she's just absorbing  all the airways she fucking sucks man why do you not like you keep saying she do you mean steve

[02:01:00]  enough with this asshole give us a break we should take a break all right you're hanging  in or we take a quick break yes up until i have another half an hour unless you throw me out  before no no way no way what's the big plug uh of course the the the debate in the atlantic city  it's in atlanta it's uh well anncoulter.com and this is one i would love to see it's uh anncoulter of  course and uh james carville at the atlantic city hilton in uh in ac it's saturday the 21st which  is this saturday right and uh it's an eight o'clock oh shit saturday yep 8 p.m ticketmaster.com 
[02:01:30]  it's an hour debate uh-huh which is great because people hear debate and they think like we're gonna  be there till midnight an hour is fine it's entertaining and you know you're very bright  and quick and he's a smart guy too it should be a very interesting have you debated him before  a few times not that often all right few times more on tv than live we'll be right back yeah okay  all right we got anncoulter in the studio having a lot of fun with her and not bad to look at either 
[02:02:00]  jesus christ she's very lovely so you're walking down the hall with those legs of yours oh my god  thing if she was doing a handstand it would look silly oh my god legs for days and uh and you know  uh there's someone on the line saying that aunt and uh and should get a room oh jeez and i i just 
[02:02:30]  watched that during the break because you're just cracking her up i'm sorry i'm strictly a traffic  girl kind of guy but i mean it was some funny shit during the break unfortunately we had to take a  break talking about uh jesse ventura rosie o'donnell uh crazy people crazy people it's those people  that you can't convince that there wasn't a conspiracy with 9-11 and now i'm sure the phone's  alive yes there wasn't and uh here we go we were talking and we're off jesse ventura and his stupid 
[02:03:00]  thermite paint and and i've reiterated this so many times you you you can't demolish a building if  anyone's ever watched discovery channel and watch building demolition crews go in to a five-story  building to try to bring it down it takes logistically it's unbelievable unbelievable  what it takes to bring down that building you're going to take down a hundred floors and set the  explosives and then they go do you know for two weeks no one was in that building they sent 
[02:03:30]  construction workers in and they were working still for 10 years you could have them drilling  holes in stanchions and beams and putting dynamite in like wily coyote we've never said this  and you have to do it twice because you got to take down two both buildings right when one would  have when one would have done the job if you were going to do that what union by the way was sending  members in and if they weren't union where was the giant rat yeah yeah what was the big blow-up rat  in front of the you can't put a fucking sink in without them protesting with a giant rat 
[02:04:00]  non-union explosive planners we're from explosive planners local 316 and we protest these scabs that  are planting explosives and thermite paint it's the dumbest argument and then rosie o'donnell also  got on we were talking about her and she had to chime in with her knowledge uh she goes and the  buildings came down and it had to be demolition because uh you can't melt steel with fire it's 
[02:04:30]  like hey rosie how is steel made with fire they melt it and they mold it into things with fire yeah  they didn't have to turn it into liquid you know you don't mine for i-beams it's just had to be  they don't dig in the ground pull i-beams up and throw it on a truck right right she's a dummy like  your point that they after after putting all of the explosives in the buildings they wait for two  planes to hit before setting them off and it still works flawlessly yeah you know the all the explosives 
[02:05:00]  go off after two planes fly into it it was pulled off perfectly what a bunch of idiots you know what  the other side of that it's scary how many people believe just that you can't that's what's scary  that you walk around with these people because there's just it's terrifying right blatant lies out  there that they are putting forth as truth and and they'll call you your gatekeeper you're one of  the gatekeeper what is this what are we larping what is this a fantasy game but dude i want those  buildings took an hour and 42 minutes to push shut up the fire chief said blow the building 
[02:05:30]  did he no he didn't did he say blow the building building seven wasn't even damaged oh it wasn't it was  on fire there was a fucking hole in the front from a landing gear i love that you know all the  details of what their arguments are because we've been through this we had them on you've had them on  strangle them they've attacked us on the street when we used to broadcast live from uh one studio to 
[02:06:00]  another they're all these we've had jesse ventura on he's he's part of that whole movement they're all  these spoiled little suburban kids suburban kids that don't have a voice so they're like listen to  me look at me i know the truth i know you don't right can is it so out of the realm of possibility  that people that have been attacking us for years decided they still don't like us came across with a  plan caught us with our pants down and and did this is that so far is that so crazy that you're 
[02:06:30]  actually accepting that explosives were planted in the building i was talking to some one of the  girls who was thank you sweetie i was talking to one of the uh the the women who was uh she was  like 19 who was arguing in favor of the conspiracy and i'm like what about the uh the voice messages  that were left by people who are they said there's our bitch males in the plane they said what was  happening and she goes well those could have been voice modification yeah yeah it's like do you  really come on conspiracy that involves more than one person will be exposed it's going to be exposed 
[02:07:00]  people can't keep their mouth shut this their conspiracy theory if it was a movie i would go  this sucks yeah like it's so unbelievable it stinks as a movie never mind in real life  it's right and right now we're getting the same thing with the birthers we have  a the short form being released b the the head of that part of the hospital saying this is all we 
[02:07:30]  released because the long form has the address and phone number of the delivering physician  we have not one but two newspaper announcements in 1961 of obama's birth now there was just a  FOIA request i don't know if the guy was a birther or just wanted to find out one way or another but  some guy in arizona i think he's radio host does a FOIA request on the visa documents when  obama's mother married that indonesia and they all went to indonesia for a while and there it is  my son barack obama born in hawaii we've been waiting a year to get the FOIA request we got it 
[02:08:00]  once again it proves he was born in hawaii and by the way what is the point it's not like you have  to be born someplace else to be a bad president jimmy carter where do they think he was from  yeah i i love i love those guys too because you can't tell them anything either why don't they come  up with the birth certificate where's and believe me i would love i would have loved for him to have  not been born an american citizen but uh he is he's an awful president and an american one thing i want 
[02:08:30]  to ask you about too because we were talking i've been complaining just as a stand-up i see what you  can do in colleges and what you can't do with the where they think that they're free thinking but  they're not and carlin we had carlin in six months before he died george um yes i forgot his name i  was like i know beard funny guy she loves you we always have fun he's smitten we love ann but he uh  he said that he's trying to make everyone uncomfortable he's like i was so he's like i'm  so sad to say but the uh censorship is coming from the left now yeah college cup campuses is where it's 
[02:09:00]  coming from and it's like you've spoken and in canada even they wouldn't let you speak in a  college it's amazing how intolerant colleges are when they preach nothing but tolerance but they're  fucking they will not tolerate right the other opinion but ann just talks hate hate speech and  that's why canada canadians don't like their hate well um francois the provost of the university  of ontario who sent me the letter threatening me with criminal prosecution if i gave a speech and 
[02:09:30]  engaged in hate speech is now being um i filed a complaint against him for engaging again in hate  speech against me for sending me that letter accusing me of hate speech until francois is in  the docks i will not be satisfied by the way the whole time i was in canada it was a week  and i had to go out dressed as as like julia roberts to avoid the press i was getting it was the  biggest thing that's hit canada since you know the calgary stampede um francois head under his bed 
[02:10:00]  the entire time he wouldn't confront you because i just kept going on air saying this is a human  rights violation here's the letter wow what is it about you get a weird response from people people  like get really angry at you like it's an odd risk because there's a lot of conservative people or a  lot of people that have ultra religious views or ultra conservative or whatever it's not the views  is it because you're an attractive blonde like they don't expect that out of you it's a really weird  thing people have for they don't think that a woman who looks like you should take the position 
[02:10:30]  i'll give you my i love that theory i don't know what it is i honestly don't know on this whole thing  too and i think you're right but also you are very unapologetic maybe like people people can be angry  with somebody and then if they sit there and go well i meant this or i really you took it the wrong way  and if i offended you i'm sorry then people go oh okay now i could like you you are one of the  most unapologetic people and it's refreshing it's like thank god oh and did you say that yeah i said 
[02:11:00]  it and how about this this and this and what are you gonna do about it can't come back at it i gotta  ask and were you always like this or did something happen in your life that turned you no i think  usually it's a traumatic event that turns into a liberal i had a normal upbringing that's why  i'm a normal christian but you were able to take care of yourself always growing up uh why two older  brothers one may be showing up here tonight he's supposed to or here tonight thank god we didn't say 
[02:11:30]  anything stupid no he listens to your show every morning he's a morning person unlike me  um and he loves you guys and i have gifts for my niece i'm hoping to pass off to him um but yeah  i had two older brothers who beat up on me so i think i could attribute it to jimmy quick i got i got  a younger sister that and and i have an older brother so she dealt with uh two older brothers and same  thing you cannot put anything past her yeah ask her what she thinks about all of the tales of torture at 
[02:12:00]  guantanamo i used to actually give my sister it was called the daily and and it was like it was  like and i just loved torturing her it was it was like dawn it's time for the daily and she'd be like  no and i'd come up and take my hand and just whack the top of her head and just and it was every  single day i'd be sitting there and be like dawn time for your daily and she's like no and i'd have 
[02:12:30]  to chase her and smack the top of her head why don't you tell ann about the headstand uh competition  you used to have oh when dawn's friends would come over you might not you might not like anthony  anymore that was when i was a kid everyone was a kid what did you know you were 30 her and her friends  were 10 shut up a few years apart why don't you tell that cute story i made her friends do  handstand contest because their nightgowns flipped over there was a genius in that though  there is there really is a brilliant it's mortified i know i had to break this love affair up just a 
[02:13:00]  little bit just a little bit all right come on a little twisted but that's how i ended up in this  seat hey uh really you were mentioning rick uh sanchez during the break you are you talking about  that yeah well i'm very upset i was gonna do a show tonight and they canceled me right and why  do they cancel you i mean how you were telling us it was pretty fucking funny well you'd have to  pull it's pretty funny well no he likes having me on and he's one of my favorite liberals to go on 
[02:13:30]  with because he'll come at you you know full throttle but then he doesn't you know go off he  doesn't start crying right he says thank you for a good debate so i really like going on his show and  i watch it and i disagree with him on everything um but i did i did get him um a thousand entries on  google the last time i was on that now connect the name rick sanchez with kitty porn you don't want to  mess with her oh my god well because he was bringing up the lie about the great civil rights 
[02:14:00]  your own he genuinely is i'm sorry he's a liberal john lewis walking in at the health care debate all  the tea partiers there and the claim was made not by john lewis himself that the tea partiers called  him the n-word 15 times n-person you hear larry can't say that n-person n-person larry's larry's  statement i hate to interrupt you during that but yeah larry's statement n-person he's our favorite of  all time he didn't know what to say he didn't know what to say and he actually said an n-person 
[02:14:30]  instead of an african-american or black so if you so if you break that down you know what he's  really saying he's actually using the word again to describe all black people you know an n-person  it's brilliant larry that's what they say larry who should cut the grass but i don't know get an  n-person very in touch larry that's very in touch you can answer any question you got  we're well equipped here i want to get that in my house big show n-person 
[02:15:00]  we also got this keep plucking that chicken that was ernie anastas oh you don't remember that  that was a great one too oh my god it's one of the greatest news bloopers ever  ernie anastas just out of nowhere he meant to say keep plucking that chicken  keep plucking that chicken that's the evening news here in new york i didn't even realize he said  they're all just like horrified i love when there's a news faux pas because they're never alone on camera 
[02:15:30]  these days so the rest of the news crew is like they make these faces that are so obviously horrific  well the one anchor with her eyes just popping out of her head where's the context yeah pop up put  that up so we can hear this yeah because the context is going to make it so much better it really is and  watching everybody's face it takes a tough man to make a tender forecast nick  and i guess that's why you keep fucking that chicken  look at her eyes look at her eyes what a great face that is she's like did he just save her eyes 
[02:16:00]  i know it's radio but you guys have seen the clip a million times i'm afraid of those eyes with ernie smiling  like that and her look of horror it looks like a comedy show here's the face she's making picture  yourself as a news anchor and your partner says keep fucking that chicken the face you would make  that's the face she's making well uh and you did say we should play the clips uh they ran in the rick  sanchez clip yeah oh they have a good yeah the startup is 37 seconds and then the other clips a little 
[02:16:30]  over men is that all right yeah sure all right so start with this and if we can get back to your  claim that what you care about is the truth why do you keep repeating the despicable lie that john  lewis was called the n-word 15 times on capitol hill at the anti-obama protest that is a lie and you  have repeated that all these this network repeats it all these networks repeated that is a lie you know at least  surely she got her reputation back let's be fair let's be fair we attribute that to the congress 
[02:17:00]  who made that assertion that's called attribution it wasn't john lewis well there were several there  who've actually said that they said it in a press conference but let me come back to this to the  matter of hand there i love that i love that it wasn't it wasn't it was it john lewis oh no yeah  you just chill out that stuff because it's like it's like yeah he's like well well it was someone  that was there yeah he had nothing uh and really fast sean and georgia sean hey and would saying that 
[02:17:30]  rick sanchez will come at you full throttle be exactly the best term to use for him considering  he got drunk and hit someone in his car  we don't let him forget that one in  i guess that should have been nicer to us because we remind people all the time that is the ace in  the hole in every argument oops full throttle how well his point is you just go  no all right here's the rick sanchez and goes after rick here so no no no no there's a hundred 
[02:18:00]  thousand dollar reward for anyone who can produce a video of someone calling john lewis the n-word  one time not to say fifteen times that reward has been out there for three months and you're  convinced because no one has taken the money that it didn't happen i mean um there is more evidence  that you have a problem with kitty porn i have as much evidence for that as you do that john lewis  was called the n-word and by the way in fact i have more evidence because there hasn't been  the press searching all over you trying to find your problem with kitty porn and a hundred thousand 
[02:18:30]  dollar reward for anyone who can produce evidence of your problem with kitty porn so i have a lot more  evidence that you have a problem with kitty porn than that any tea party or ever called john lewis  the n-word one time forget fifteen times all right we're you and i are not going to solve that  because i wasn't there and neither were you and all we've done is attributed what some people have  said okay i wasn't in your private room when you were going through kitty porn we'll wait for that  person we'll wait for that person to come in with and accept a hundred thousand dollar reward  how long do you wait you have made an accusation that a great civil rights hero was called the n-word 
[02:19:00]  you're trying to prove a negative and i want to get back and i want to get back to this point  all right okay you prove you don't have a problem with kitty porn you know no i don't want to talk  about kitty porn i want to go back to the assertion that you made wow on cnn wow oh is that brutal and  can i say uh not one denial out of old ricky boy wait a minute what happened there can we go to google  i want to see what happens when you put rick sanchez in his aunt said it's pretty impressive 
[02:19:30]  oh my god rick sanchez in now that is owning him yeah does kitty porn i don't think i mentioned  kitty porn enough no no kitty porn kitty porn but by the way in to his great credit and this is why  i love him we get to the end of this this totally heated debate and he's totally lovely and he says  thanks for coming on and i say thank you for having me i love liberals who are smart and have confidence  like who's the toughest guy you've debated like who's the hardest guy if you've you've you've gone 
[02:20:00]  you've gone back and forth with or woman who's the toughest one that's a good question there's got  to be some of them that are very very tough well like i say most of them won't go against me now so  i end up with the homeless girl who would you like to go against um donna brazil mickey donna  brazil was she ran gore's campaign okay she was famous briefly probably made fun of her for saying  we're not going to let the white boys win this campaign and you're running a white boy  he has so little rhythm he is so much wider than george bush he says all the time he's a nerd he is 
[02:20:30]  an absolute nerd he's a nerd however i will say this about al gore um who knew he and i had so much  in common wowie i've actually stayed in that hotel the hotel lucia i think and uh i behaved just as  naughtily oh really oh boy was she telling the truth i know that language how you doing my glutes i was  on a plane all day were you really al he skated past that right yeah it's tough to prove it's over 
[02:21:00]  that one word against the other it's real hard to prove so who else uh donna brazil mickey cows i  don't know who that is cows files really great webs he just ran against barbara boxer in the primary  okay very smart wrote for you know new republic newsweek um who else he's very smart and honest oh i  love laurence o'donnell and he's getting a tv show on msnbc because of course when he'd fill in  for oberman he he got 40 percent higher viewers which i don't understand because i personally can't 
[02:21:30]  miss oberman that's got to be like 30 40 more viewers how about chomsky  chomsky noam chomsky does he do debate is he still alive  i don't know actually how about snooki would you debate i think we agree isn't she upset about  the tanning tax or something yeah it's very upset about that this is important it's not like the  whole world's falling apart we got snooki all over the tv as long as snooki's on tv we know there'll 
[02:22:00]  be another day they're saying she's officially annoying do you know that she's being charged  uh for being a pest john mccain said something about her that she's uh too pretty to go to jail  pretty to go to jail he was really talking her up like mccain mccain was getting a little smitten  he wants to get in that elephant ass of hers holy shit that ass is horrendous and it's a big fan  though snooki loves it oh loves the snook and that whole show is a waste do you know competitors 
[02:22:30]  send their products are the other competitors bags to her because it makes the product look bad  they actually do like they send each other's products to her there's the elephant ass that's  funny yes and check out an elephant not a good i don't think that's that bad actually that's rough  it's not that bad that's what i have to stick up for it is not a good look no that's rough you know  why isn't she wearing underwear because she's snooki she's crazy i forgot them wild she's from jersey 
[02:23:00]  she probably used them to carry cheese doodles she's really not according to my favorite governor  she's from new york ah favorite governor chris christie new jersey like him but what's what  did he just do that really annoyed me it wasn't that bad i didn't like that politically it was the  no no no the uh changing the language to like uh make it against the law now in legislation to to  say the words mentally retarded or feeble-minded and it's a person first attitude like a person  that this is your issue it's always for me language is language is a big one yeah yeah 
[02:23:30]  it drives me crazy and i'm but this is for legal documents right some probably but it's such we  become so obsessed in it and people get in trouble for it and that's why it drives me you know i  understand if it's a person the second you start legislating language like that it gets people in  trouble for using it yeah it kind of makes the word so taboo that before you say it into a microphone  and now you're in trouble you're losing your job well i agree with you there yeah yeah and it's and  it's and one of your one of my favorite culture quotes was in 07 this was off the who was isaiah 
[02:24:00]  washington was he the guy that said faggot and you talk about john edwards and uh he went into rehab  isaiah washington which by the way everyone knew at the time that he was a problem and you said i was  going to have a few comments in the day about uh a few comments on the other democratic presidential  candidate john edwards but it turns out that you have to go to rehab if you use the word faggot  so i'm kind of at an impasse can't really talk about edwards i think i'll just conclude here  and take your questions brutal and you know what though that killed yeah as much as tiger has gotten  shit and jesse james has gotten shit he was the worst of them all he wanted to look what he was 
[02:24:30]  doing look at the double like john edwards was despicable and he went to be president yeah this  isn't hollywood and by the way in trade you know in trade it used to be very accurate for um better  than polls because it was people putting their money down on who was going to win an election right  yeah and it's a little less accurate now because it's so hard to bid you have to send in like  passports and stuff um but back then it was incredibly accurate and obama hillary edwards  were all sort of tracking the same faggot joke edwards collapsed that's why they were so upset because 
[02:25:00]  everybody looked at him and said you know he is kind of a faggot and his response was bullshit he  didn't come back and go hey that really annoyed me he came back with some disgusting political  response and i think that bugged people his wife around yeah oh did he really yeah she emerged from  from chemo treatment yeah the sick wife tour wow while he was uh banging real hunter he really is a  a despicable although as a strategist you have to kind of admire the ruthlessness he would have our 
[02:25:30]  problems overseas cleared up very quickly anybody that can do that would just fucking carpet bomb the  entire country so there's a part of me that thinks well that's the man for the job might have been  the guy huh he really is a ruthless nice-haired having prick i think anne has to go i do yeah  you're looking at your watch yeah i know i'm so sad i want to stay all day this is so much fun  yeah to bet your brother didn't make it in because uh yeah because i'm gonna be carrying these gifts  around all day okay what'd you get her um so you don't want to say because she might hear it 
[02:26:00]  oh good but no i don't think she's allowed to listen to opie and anthony that's adults only  come on now dirty dirty dirty adults so you were not very dirty today so i thank you yeah we try  try to keep it a little nice there are a few dirty words but that's right okay this is very weird  because there's no comer i think i did it there's no commercial we love the awkward yeah we love the  awkward walkout where now you have to walk out while we're still live on the air  let's make her walk out awkwardly that's you are a mean guy all right bye anne that means we get

[02:30:00]  legit and uh on the up and up every time you're on the show  i came here with a mission to get close to the princess of uh sweden  and i've been stalking her the last few days she's a woman who was in a sex scandal a few months back  she was banging the goalie of the new york rangers uh lundquist  oh yeah okay  who i think so stiff by the way i think the rangers should turf him they should have signed the canadians goal or hollick who was just traded  because he's not a winner this guy you know all swedish players they're all good until the playoffs they all choke 
[02:30:30]  well you know like most european players but anyhow  so i've been stalking her getting close to her i was at a party last night  and i i should email norton these pictures which i will  you know dude a swedish fashion party last night his highness  maybe two other guys and 400 swedish chicks how much better can that be  jesus nice how much better does it get  can't beat you up on that one ian  that's nice  oh it felt like i died and gone to heaven man 
[02:31:00]  hey how do you go undercover though because because you're very recognizable with uh the big glasses and the loud suits and stuff  they know me man because i've been on all the talk shows here promoting my movies i was on scablin have you heard of this show called scablin  no  it's the swedish talk show it's bigger than the tonight show i thought you know  why the fuck should i go on this show they called me  i tried to bail two days before the show they said dude no one has fucking ever bailed on this show  we had jay-z on last week rihanna two weeks ago who the fuck are you to bail on us 
[02:31:30]  so i fucking trekked the suite and never heard of this stiff in my life  go on the show and the next fucking day i can't walk the streets of stockholm  everybody  and their uncle watches that show it's on friday night it's bigger than jonathan ross  so once again i ask how do you go undercover then yeah  you're certainly not undercover  i'm in disguise right now man  what's your disguise  new shades and uh yeah you know maybe slick the hair back a little  yeah you know put a little shoe polish in it 
[02:32:00]  yeah you know change the color the whole thing but yeah  but yeah i've been following the swedish princess the last few days and i've got pretty close to her  and now what do you look what are you looking to get from her  pussy  all right  his highness only likes royal pussy  what would you do to her  i smelled her puss last night  i was at a party with her  yeah  two bodyguards behind her i was making them so nervous man 
[02:32:30]  i thought they were gonna jump me  they were good but she likes me this princess man  really  she's always putting her arm around me  and i could smell her puss last night  like she was wearing a short skirt  and i don't think she was wearing underwear under there  i kept looking there was no  not even floss in the back  and it was just really  and it was just waffling  oh dude  i i think  i would love  you know anthony  what does swedish pussy smell like uh... in halpern  well i've banged a few swedish chicks before  yeah what does it smell like down there 
[02:33:00]  meatballs with hair on it  you know it's much different than the bronx  than uh... let's say  jesus  you know downtown new york where it's a bit dodgy  because you don't really know what you're getting there  because everyone and their uncle's been in that pussy  but in sweden it's usually pure  especially princess pussy  probably not much in there  i'm telling you  i even told her  i said look  even if you have your period right now  i'm ready to go down  wow  that's a good one  you're a trooper huh  yeah  and i'll tell you another thing here

[02:48:30]  he has a  bad rep  i think it's  i would have  let they  tried to  replace him  because the  band was  going to  break up  they were  looking for  and then  they got  back together  i think  they should  have  replaced  him  here i'm  sending over  the princess  with me  now  this is  at 3  in the  morning  last night  so his  highness  is looking  a bit  rough  there  so is  the  princess  hey your  highness  we had  montana  fishburn  on the  show  yesterday  well what  did she  say man  well we  fucked it  up a little  bit we  weren't  well prepared  we should  have called  you for  some knowledge 
[02:49:00]  but uh  she was  alright  she was  cool  yeah she's  a nice  person  have you  seen the  porno  no  but i  heard that  it was  all because  her dad  used to  have a lot  of porn  magazines  around the  house  and she  became  obsessed  with porn  at an  early age  did she  say that  no  yeah  her dad  apparently  he's been  cussing her  out for  doing the  porn  but he's  the biggest  pimp daddy  himself  so you  know the  guy's a  pervert  wow  pervert  yeah 
[02:49:30]  look the  apple doesn't  fall far  from the  tree here  and you  gotta look  at the  situation  she was  influenced  by something  and apparently  it was  because he  was into  a lot  of you  know adult  porn  and magazines  and stuff  like that  they'd be  around the  house  wow  well we  didn't know  that  would you  do her  yeah  no  nope  although there's  some shit  going on  around her  ass and  stuff but  oh yeah  not even  close to  doing that  yeah  what does  she have  some  colitis 
[02:50:00]  around the  ass  or something  it's like  well quite  frankly the  more we  studied it  it looks  like cigarette  fucking  burns  it looks  like someone  like burnt  her ass  with cigarettes  and it  kind of  you know  put like  dark spots  on her  ass  yeah that  might be  a lot of  chicks  they have  plastic surgery  around their  butt  oh maybe  some light bulb  Frank Ryan  have you heard  of him  he just  died  yeah  he's the  most famous  plastic surgeon  in Hollywood  and she  might have  got some

[03:03:30]  put a gun  in the face  of an honest  man and  take his  money  that's typical  and then  complain about  how the  neighborhood  is not  what it  used to  be  that's  typical  when you  babble  about food  and your  mother that  nobody cares  about  that's typical  excuse me

[03:05:30]  scars  no  you know  what I mean  it was like  a hassle  that he had  to be  molested  he's like  fuck  he's a healthy  guy  he's stable  he knows  what he wants  he's ready  for a kid  I never thought  Florentine would  have a kid  or a dog  never  he used to  go to  people's  houses  and they  got a dog  if you go  what kind  of dog  was it  I don't  know  I won't  look at  it  is it  a thing  I have  no idea  it runs  around 
[03:06:00]  I won't  give it  any attention  he wouldn't  know  and people  would go  at a dog  like she'd  go  what dog  I don't  know  what  you  mean  he refused  to acknowledge  people's dogs  and now he's a dog  owner  he has one  him and his ex  girlfriend had one  he kind of got  attached to it  wow  what's the dog  I forget  it's a little  small one  little yip yip  yes  and uh  I gotta go to  his one man show  man  fuck  I'm sure  he's having me  fucking rolling  with this stuff  about his son  I know he's  gonna have a new  hour in like  two weeks  when's the 
[03:06:30]  one man show  I'm not sure  he was doing  it maybe Kenny  will know  that faggot  yeah the little  uh  the little  the little effort  gives you material  that's for sure  yeah yeah yeah  holy shit  stuff happening  every day  uh  uh  uh  oh yeah  American Airlines  Jesus Christ  enough  how much money  do you need  from us  to travel  amazing  this is one of  the ballsiest  fucking moves  I think  uh  now they're doing  seating like you're  going to a concert  yeah  for an extra 50 bucks 
[03:07:00]  you can now fly  the plane  American Airlines  uh  just announced  they're gonna charge  passengers  20 to 40 dollars  more for seats  in front of coach  and call them  express seats  express seats  now  I mean in the front  of coach  which is different  not there's not a  special section  no no  you're in the coach  section but coach  because you have  the first few rows  closer to the door  the exit  uh  that's gonna cost you  more  because uh  apparently you can  get out a little  faster I guess  if uh  you you're  you're in the front 
[03:07:30]  uh  and yeah  you get your overhead  shit and then you're  out after the first  class people  and as flyers  we're not thinking  oh wow  this is great for us  you're gonna be  stuck paying the  20 or 40 dollars  extra because  you're gonna  that's the only  seats that are  gonna be left  available  and you're gonna  have to pay  extra  and  the fucking  balls of these  big fucking  corporations man  here's the only  defense of  American  the only defense  go ahead  the seats on  American can only  be bought at  airports  between 24 hours 
[03:08:00]  to 50 minutes  before the flight  the uh  they still provide  their elite  frequent flyers  those seats  at no extra  charge  so if frequent  flyers don't  take those seats  and don't want  those seats  24 hours  or a few  up to an hour  before the flight  you can buy them  that's the only  thing that makes  me go that they  don't completely  sell  they're trying to  justify you know  why they're taking  more money  I mean they're not  fucking their own  frequent flyers  which is  well  I like  okay  what is um  what is my  coach though 
[03:08:30]  what is that  it's a guy  who kind of  leads the team  it's not necessarily  the boss  but he kind of  dictates  oh okay  I knew that was  gonna bomb  the minute my  mouth opened  what is coach  it's a really cool  handbag company  there's coach  there he is  it's a really good  character from a show  I was more of a  fan of the white  shadow myself  oh god  I hated Ken Howard  you know Ken Howard  used to jerk  salami off in the  fucking bathroom  how do you even 
[03:09:00]  remember the name  who doesn't remember  salami's name  Ken Howard was  always concerned  with his young  black players  and they'd always  go yo coach  and then they'd  rape whatever girl  he was dating  in person  in person  right  I don't remember  the rest of the  white shadow  that was a terrible  fucking show  and they looked  black  they didn't act  black though  cause they loved  him and they  all had fun  with the white  coach  is that the  white shadow  is it  yeah he's a bit  old now  oh my god  he shows up  every once in a  while right  Ken Howard 
[03:09:30]  wow is he fat  should be the  fucking white blob  jeez what  happened  I don't know  two in a row  I don't know  I don't have  any excuses  to answer your  question man  look at the  fucking clock  that's what  happened  oh my god  tick tock  I got some  kind of meeting  oh  not the one  you should be  going to though  unfortunately  yeah we got  excited for a second  it's a codependent 
[03:10:00]  co-host  oh my god  thank god  finally  wow he's  finally realized  look I'm taking  care of my  issues  me and opie  are like your  fucking  like your kids  that you hit  when you come  in  we just hug  each other  and chatter  right  by the way  dude I found  out what was  wrong with your  fucking milk  what  this is a very  similar story  don't fucking  we already  go ahead  sorry I blew it  go ahead  I don't know  if you covered  the story  did you guys  cover it  yeah we did  that's the only  reason  did you  bottle of water  yes 
[03:10:30]  oh I didn't know  you covered that  are you saying  that someone  is  probably just  mentioned it  in passing  jizzing in my  bowl of cereal  yeah  what a creep  man arrested  for jerking off  into a co-worker's  water bottle  twice  we did the headline  we didn't get  deep into the story  oh what a creep  he looks like  Elo  young Elo  oh really  yeah he jerked  off into her  what a scumbag  ejaculating  into colleagues  drink  but who  did she drink it  the first time  and she said  she felt sick  and she didn't  there was something  wrong  he probably shook  it up  oh no  and then the second 
[03:11:00]  time  oh my god  I just got  fucking that  I'm thirsty  me too  but then the second  time she took  it to a fucking  lab and they  analyzed it  and they tied  it to that  scumbag  through DNA  what kind of  job  oh Pete  texted me  my agent  Cottonell  does the same  thing  office job  yeah  just an office  job  yeah he was  what happened  was there was  a job opening  for cum in the  bottle guy  and he wanted  it and he was  just  you know what  yes  Chris 
[03:11:30]  was he stalking  this  I don't know  man  that's not even  sexual  that's angry  yeah  that would mean  we have to  read the story  I don't know  hey Chris  on Long Island  what's up  what's up  guys  welcome aboard  thank you sir  just going about  the American  Airlines charge  we were talking  about before  you know  it doesn't matter  how quick  you get off  the plane  once you get  down to the  baggage turnstile  it takes 45  minutes for that  fucking thing  to go around  so what  yeah  and the guys  that know  how to fly  are the  businessmen  so those 
[03:12:00]  would be the  frequent flyer  guys  so they already  have their bag  on the plane  they know  how to do  that shit  this is just  a way to get  more fucking  money from  us  what the fuck  I mean  the balls  of them  to charge  you for  luggage  is insane  as a separate  charge  really  yeah  and especially  as people  we just accept  whatever's thrown  at us  we have to  what are you  gonna do  walk  you know  they really  got you  by the  fucking  balls  but you  think  some  airline  would  take  advantage  of that  I guess  they have 
[03:12:30]  right  announced  that they  won't charge  for bags  it was so  irritating  dude  I was flying  American  back from  LA  and I  noticed  that they  had put  my soda  down  and I  didn't notice  it was put  down  because I  was on  my lie  flat seat  and I  was asleep  I had the  comforter  and the  pillow  and  how is that  first class  in American  cross country  767  200  it's a  767  put it this  way  it's like  coming in 
[03:13:00]  somebody's  mouth for  five hours  let me  say it  for the  record  I would  never  pay that  kind of  money to  fly  but  the  networks  have  it's  contractual  when they  fly  I've  said this  before  not because  I'm ashamed  of flying  first  but I don't  think I'm  hotter shit  than I am  they do  it for  everyone  full fare  is about  $5,000  but they  get it  a lot  cheaper  the networks  have deals  that was 
[03:13:30]  your seat  to LA  that looks  like it  that's close  to it  with comforters  I think  that's a  7  that might  be the  777  I'll tell  you why  because you  only have  three rows  of one  no  it's two  rows  one in the  middle  mine was  not quite  that good  I have  two at  the window  one in  the middle  two window  one middle  two at the  window  767  767  200  go to that  one top left  Danny before I  kiss you on the  mouth hard 
[03:14:00]  it's not  no  these are  better  that's  continental  that looks like  it has  American Airlines  yeah  whatever  it's fucking  I don't feel  guilty  I was a fucking  coach the first  fucking 15 years  of my career  I was on  Virgin once  in one of those  sleep pods  remember the time  where they didn't  have a ticket for me  at the gate  and you guys  just went  oh we'll see you  in Vegas  oh god  yeah  yeah  and then I'm  sitting there  fucking yelling  and screaming  at XM  like I don't  have a fucking  seat on this  plane  and then  Wicklin  figured out 
[03:14:30]  that well  if I fly  past Vegas  all the way  to LA  then I could  double back  to Vegas  and trying to  be there  for the  fucking show  as I watch  Vegas from  the sky  pass me by  where I'm  supposed to be  yeah so could  you guys just  drop us out  with parachutes  I think I  arrived eight  hours after  you guys did  I believe  you are not  happy  oh man  that was a  bad fucking  day  but the  flight  Eric Logan  finally got me  was Virgin  and it was  like a sleep  pod  yeah the thing 
[03:15:00]  is the whole  seat is like  in a pod  and then it  goes back  and you lay  down like you're  in a bed  you just sleep  the whole fucking  way  fuck it  too bad you  can't pull  something over  you like make  it a sleep  chamber  you get a  blankie  I want a  sleep chamber  just pull  your blankie  over your  head  nah not  the same  man  oh it's  great  Jonathan  flies everywhere  in the world  and he's  flown  the best  airlines  are like  Cathay Pacific  Emirates  these weird  airlines that  are not  Singapore  and he gets  upgraded a lot  because he has  so many miles  on American 
[03:15:30]  and from the  credit cards  whatever  Jonathan really  knows how to  fucking get a  good airline ticket  for a relatively  reasonable price  I don't know how  he does it  either  that's why I  think him and  his big cock  I think he's  just a fucking  gay male hustler  who lets people  he lets rich Arabs  suck his dick  for airlines  tickets  they worship  his big Jewish  dick  the balls  are so heavy  I can't believe  balls  such big balls  and they have  that fucking  cuckolding thing  the big Jewish  dick  I think we've  just kind of 
[03:16:00]  we have what  about another  half hour of the  show  I think we're  going to do  some open  phones here  because Junior  reminded us  of something  we should have  talked about  what's that  hold on  Junior  it's a hotel  room  Singapore  first class  on Emirates  oh that's  Emirates  it's a fucking  room  yeah that's  that's a room  you get in your own  room  the guy's just  lounging  reading a book  dude you could  jerk off there  you could  fucking  fuck and sock  then you get to  your destination  you could punch  women in the face  yeah  fantastic  emirates  boo their genitals  is that emirates

[03:30:30]  with a hat or something  I was totally shocked  what do you mean a hat or something  just let me wear my hijab  she was given  as an interim solution  until something permanently  could be worked out  we were trying to accommodate her  with a backstage  position that would allow her to work  so we gave her a couple different options  for different roles backstage  in the interim  until we could work out  a permanent solution  and she chose to  not to take those  and to go home  I'm not here to scare anybody  I'm just here to wear my headscarf

[03:42:30]  of September  all right  cool  y'all be  good  thank you  see you  buddy  where is PETA  protesting the  bedbuck murders  bedbug killings  they don't  why do animal  rights activists  leave insects  out as if  they're not  a viable  life form  yeah that's  a whole  argument  but I mean  why  I don't  know why  that  roaches  bedbugs  some are  like hardcore 
[03:43:00]  and don't  want anything  killed  how about  you know  that's  I think  it would  really make  you look  silly  no no  but where  is their  moral argument  let me  take your  question  and dumb  it down  a little  bit  rats  how do  they feel  about rats  that's  like  fucking  pests  that we  all hate  too  something  we all  hate  I don't  think  they want  them  killed  but do  they rally  for the  rats  I don't  know  it's a  good  question  let's  start  there  before we  get into  the bug  argument  but I  don't  know  why  mice  rats  what do  they  think 
[03:43:30]  bedbugs  don't care  about the  rats  of course  they're not  going to  care about  bedbugs  what's their  stance on  rats  I think  they don't  want you  to kill  them  but  here's the  difference  rats carry  disease  so they  may say  when it  comes to  disease  carrying  things  that we  understand  that  I don't  know  but bedbugs  do not  carry  disease  I think  they do  any parasite  carries 
[03:44:00]  disease  they don't  transmit  disease  they  give you  something  you get  a case  of the  hats  you wake  up with  just hats  on your  head  someone had  a clever  magic  johnson  joke  by the  way  about  the  bedbugs  what  was it  I don't  want to  fucking  blow the  guy's  line  something  about  the  bedbugs  started  at the  magic  johnson  movie  theater  and  magic  johnson  got  his  bug  from  being  in bed  or  something  like 
[03:44:30]  that  there's  something  with a  bug  there  yeah  fuck  I want  to know  the exact  line  it's an  AIDS  joke  with the  AIDS  the guy  did nail  it though  it was a  good line  that we  didn't get  a chance  to throw  in the  air  I know  what it  was  it was  probably  something  like  they all  started  the  magic  johnson  theater  shooting  hoops  or something  see you  tomorrow  I don't  I don't  think  that's  it  bye </pre>
