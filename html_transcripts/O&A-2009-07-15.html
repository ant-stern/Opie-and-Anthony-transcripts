<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion about a basking shark found on Long Island, initially misidentified as a great white, followed by mockery of a news anchor's reporting.  This transitioned into criticism of Barack Obama's All-Star Game pitching performance, laced with racially charged jokes.  The conversation then veered towards a massive ocean garbage patch, leading to a tangent about daredevil Ronnie Madison, whom the hosts hoped to call.  Jellyfish and their dangers, particularly in Australia, were also discussed, interspersed with caller anecdotes.  A lengthy segment focused on the website JapaneseBugFights.com, featuring graphic descriptions of insect battles. The show concluded this section by bemoaning the endless commercials, even on satellite radio.

The next segment addressed scheduling changes and a surprising increase in content despite a shorter broadcast.  Two anonymous "perv stories" prompted a discussion about a "perv switch," leading into a lengthy, vulgar fantasy about cavemen life,  detailing their crude living conditions and sexual practices. A caller, Tom from Chicago, contributed to this discussion, speculating about cavemen in the afterlife.  Further "perv stories" were recounted – one involving a naked man assaulting his roommate and another about a man grinding his genitals against a woman in a Dollar Tree.  Callers also offered commentary on Michael Jackson's death (referred to as a possible homicide) and the cancelled "Cavemen" sitcom.  The segment continued with a discussion of primitive brain surgery ("trepanation"),  followed by a shift to modern topics: the difference between "online" and "inline," regional food preferences, and gym class memories.  It concluded with a highlight reel of a previous guest appearance by Rich and Bonnie, and brief mentions of a "BCN thing" and a fee dispute.

The following segment opened with a discussion of an actress and her role as a prostitute, then shifted to Ian Halperin's book about Michael Jackson (excluding child molestation allegations), focusing on the book’s marketing. Anthony then described a lonely day at home, leading to a broader discussion on loneliness, interspersed with songs about loneliness by various artists, including R.E.M., the Thompson Twins, and Johnny Cash's "Hurt."  Ben Mesrick, author of "The Accidental Billionaires," joined the show in studio to discuss the book and Mark Zuckerberg, including details about Zuckerberg’s social life and Facebook’s origins.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Facebook's impact on social interaction and communication.

A further segment featured Ben Mezrich again, discussing “The Accidental Billionaires,” its movie adaptation, and his research, including visits to Harvard secret societies and the "fuck truck."  The conversation moved to the decline of the radio industry and the role of consultants.  The hosts previewed an upcoming guest, Ian Halperin, and a YouTube video of their guest pitch meetings, followed by critical discussion of Halperin's book and Fox News interview. The segment concluded with a backstage search for missing condiments and commentary on a TV host's physique.

The final segment discussed Wendy Williams and a listener's misunderstanding of an Imus impression.  The majority of the segment focused on a poorly-received joke by Danny about a Brooklyn grandmother borrowing a pornographic film from the library.  The joke, described as a "bomb," was dissected repeatedly, along with other past "bombs," including one involving a "fart box set" of DVDs.  The Brooklyn library and pornographic tapes were briefly mentioned, and J Mac from Cleveland was noted as a guest. The hosts concluded by sharing their own experiences with failed jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Alright, we're here.  There it is, the all-important music.  Yeah, start calling, fuckers.  Hi.  I just learned about this shark from Anthony Cumia of the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess there was a 24-foot shark that washed up on the shores of Long Island.  Yep.  Somewhere what, around Babylon?  Yeah, south shore somewhere.  Somewhere, and I'm looking at this thing going, wow, that's a huge great white. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, no.  And then they had a cameraman, like, you know, taking video of the thing.  I'm sure it's all over YouTube and what's not.  Yeah.  If you're somewhere else and you want to see the shark that rolled up onto the beaches.  It's funny, the local news here, Fox.  The local news, me and Ann just sit here.  We get in early just so we can watch these dummies on Fox.  What is it, Good Day, New York?  Yeah, something like that.  They, we shake our heads in disbelief. 
[00:01:00]  How stupid they are.  At how stupid they are and how poorly they do the news.  They're showing footage of the shark that is pretty much right up on shore, but the waves  are moving it around a little bit.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  It's in the surf kind of rolling around a little.  And the one anchor, the blonde bimbo, she's like, wow, that's a sick shark that's having  a tough time breathing.  Is it?  And then all it took was literally reading the first sentence of the story that's in 
[00:01:30]  every New York paper about this.  Yeah.  And it says that it's a dead shark.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at the size of it compared to the people.  See, it's not sick.  It's not breathing.  It's dead.  It's dead.  Just like the basics of the story that you're telling the rest of New York, you dummy.  It's dead.  But besides that, where I was confused, I was just thinking gray white.  When you see something like that, you go, oh, a gray white shark.  Anthony's telling me, no.  No, it's a basking shark.  A basking shark.  It was basking in the sun. 
[00:02:00]  Stupid shark.  And forgot to breathe.  Yeah.  And they have the clip of a surfer or something saying like, well, when I saw it, I thought  it was a great white.  Or it looked to me like it was a great white.  And then a marine biologist goes, well, you can notice there's no teeth in the mouth.  They don't have teeth.  Basking sharks.  But you made a good point.  If you see that in the water, you're dying on the spot of a heart attack.  Dude, you're just freaking...  Imagine you go into complete panic mode.  You would.  You'd drown. 
[00:02:30]  And it turns out the shark can't even hurt you.  You would drown just thinking that that might be...  You're not thinking, oh, all right, it's a basking shark.  I'm safe.  I'll just let this behemoth swim past me.  Because it's a harmless.  Yeah.  It's a harmless shark.  Giant, jaws-sized shark.  Couldn't the thing swallow you, though?  Swallow you whole.  Swallow you whole.  Little tenderizing.  Down you go.  Look how big that is. 
[00:03:00]  Is that the shark from yesterday?  That is...  Holy mackerel.  That's the size of the shark in jaws.  That is pretty much it.  Which was kind of a joke shark.  Yeah.  They made it extra large in jaws.  Can you imagine if you knew better, though, and you knew what kind of shark that was,  and you walked up to it in the water and just put your dick in its mouth?  Watch what I do.  Make him look silly.  Sharks just kind of nursing on it.  Feeling stupid.  I'd love to bite you, but I got no teeth.  The picture looks like it's a mini whale. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  I mean, it's whale-like in size.  Yeah.  I think whales are smaller than that.  Or certain...  Certain, yeah.  Certain species of whales.  That is a biggie, but a lot of people making a big to-do, like, whoa, 20-foot shark.  Washed up on shore.  And then you realize, all right, it's, you know, it's one of them harmless ones.  They've got the huge teeth and big, great white, big belly.  Porker.  It's a porker.  Pretty cool, though.  Yeah.  Well, I told them to call, and now they're calling. 
[00:04:00]  Did you watch the All-Star Game, man?  No, I didn't.  I saw the highlights.  We openly admitted.  Which is all I needed to say.  We wouldn't watch that crap.  No, why bother?  We did watch Obama throw out the first pitch, and...  Wow.  He could be the whitest president we've ever had.  He should have just thrown it underhand.  What a disappointment to all black men everywhere.  It was on the mark.  He's not an athlete.  It was a high-arcing ball that...  It looked like a screwball. 
[00:04:30]  It was just a high-arcing ball, and his pitching style was a little spastic.  Little?  He had a little bit of a limp wrist to it, too.  The side view didn't look as bad as the back view did.  And he's very happy, but I wouldn't be happy.  Oh, he's happy he didn't do that fucking Mayor of Cincinnati pitch.  Whoa.  That would be a good one.  Ha-ha, and Obama threw it a little left. 
[00:05:00]  Ha-ha, you know what I mean?  Ha-ha, left-leaning pitch.  I guess that was it.  Travis, anything else with the All-Star Game?  No, not really.  It was a good game.  He did this goofy, and away we go.  Yeah.  Kind of a Jackie Gleason thing before he threw the ball.  He tried to bring his knee way up like the pitchers do.  It's like, just throw the ball.  He jogged out to the mound like, yeah, here we go.  Uh-huh.  Right there, he's just going, if I fuck this up, it is going to be on every goddamn video. 
[00:05:30]  You know what, I know you're not a big Obama fan, but the one thing you've got to respect  about him, for real, is that he's wearing a White Sox jersey or White Sox, like, you  know, jacket.  Yeah, yeah.  Because most politicians can't make a decision who their team is.  Uh-huh.  And at least he's going, oh, no, I'm a White Sox fan, which is pretty dangerous.  I wish he was a white voter fan, because reading some of these tax implications that  I have, jeepers creepers. 
[00:06:00]  He was a white voter fan, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's what got him in.  Yeah, that's what got him in.  I think so.  But in Chicago, you know, it's Cubs and White Sox, and it's pretty brutal up there.  Yeah, yeah.  You either like the White Sox or the Cubs, and if you like the White Sox, then, you  know, you have to hate Cubby fans and vice versa.  Pretty strong rifle.  So I think it's pretty brave of him that he made a choice in a city like Chicago, which  baseball team he likes, and he's sticking with it.  Yeah, that's kind of like a Mets-Yankee thing here in New York.  And he kind of did that during the campaign, right? 
[00:06:30]  He kind of came out and said he was a White Sox fan.  Yeah.  I do believe.  Unlike, I mean...  Oh, Hillary.  Yeah.  It always goes back to Hillary, where she couldn't make, you know, her mind up what team she  liked.  Oh, when she was running for Senate in New York State.  Holy shit.  She was a Mets fan one day, a Yankee fan the next day.  And then on off day, she was, like, supporting the Cubs or something, because she lived up  there.  And they asked her, what are you, Mets or a Yankee fan?  I believe both teams have the merits in certain areas. 
[00:07:00]  Some are...  One team is better than the other, and I cannot pick one, and I think you shut up.  Politics talk.  Which she disappeared to.  They just threw her somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  Like, she's out of the spotlight.  She's somewhere in the world getting food poisoning.  Yeah, she's shitting her brains out somewhere in the world, getting fucking tetanus shots  and shots for the plague and everything else.  As Bill just, hey, to keep her out of the fucking gun she had.  You think they'd give her all her shots right to her big, fat ankles? 
[00:07:30]  Oh, I thought it meant a big, fat ass with a doctor that's got to poke that fucking ass  with the shots when she goes overseas.  Yeah, she disappeared.  Yeah, she really...  She's a non-factor.  Yeah, and it's the Secretary of State, you know, you'd think she'd be out there doing  some shit.  I don't know what she does.  She doesn't...  She's not really in the news a lot.  No, I don't know.  Honestly, that's a very good question.  You forget, because she was on the news almost every day. 
[00:08:00]  James, the trucker, has more on the basking shark.  James.  James?  Yeah, I'm surprised Professor Anthony didn't speak up about this.  The basking shark is the second largest shark in the world.  Yes, to the whale shark.  Well, it's...  To the nerd shark.  No, I think it's the...  Is it blue?  The blue shark, or...  No, this shark that they found is actually a baby, because the size makes it a baby, rather 
[00:08:30]  than being a full-grown basking shark.  The basking shark is upwards to 50 and 70 feet long.  Get the fuck out of here.  Could you do some research on the basking shark today, Danny?  That's a monster.  That's a real live monster.  They're saying that shark that we just saw the picture of is a baby shark.  It's a little baby.  Are you kidding me?  Really?  Really?  They are giant.  They open up their mouth.  Where is Jimmy?  Right here.  Jimmy's right here.  Jimmy, he's waking up. 
[00:09:00]  He's reading the paper.  Thank you, James.  Where is Jimmy?  You just said he's here.  Oh, my God.  Are you stupid?  All right.  Yeah, look at how big they open their mouth.  They open their giant mouth, and then they just take in, like, what do they eat?  Krill?  Do they eat krill?  I heard they only eat fried foods.  It's the E-rock shark.  Might as well take up where we left off yesterday.  Shark with tits. 
[00:09:30]  We'll call them monsters, because Anthony likes that.  These monsters that don't eat, like, anything of substance, but they're still massively huge,  I don't get that.  Yeah.  They just eat these little, like, little plankton or something.  And they just gain a lot of weight and muscle.  And they have to eat, like, 8,000 tons of it.  Right.  A day.  Yeah.  Where is all that shit?  I don't know.  Man, the ocean's just big.  The ocean's big.  And someone said the other day that there's garbage in the ocean. 
[00:10:00]  We know that.  But supposedly it's the size of the United States.  No.  It's not that big.  There's a big.  Somebody do a study on this?  But there's one area where it's all just a massive amount of just garbage floating.  Yeah, because it floats, I guess, it floats off the West Coast and just somehow gets, like,  caught in a current.  Right.  And it just starts, it just circles.  So all this stuff just gets caught.  In the head, Nino.  And it's a pretty sizable.  How big is it?  I'm not sure.  It's not as big as the United States.  Someone said it was as big.  That's crazy.  It is a pretty, it's a pretty big area. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know how crazy it is.  When you fly over these oceans, man, you realize how massive the oceans are.  That's why I don't believe that we're running out of fish.  That's stupid.  Look how much water's out there.  Shut up.  Stop telling me that.  A lot more water than land.  And we got a lot of fucking land.  It's the size of Texas.  Texas?  Oh.  Jesus.  A big garbage pile the size of Texas.  Just floating in the ocean.  That's just one pile.  Why is that?  Because we decided it was smart to just dump our shit in the ocean. 
[00:11:00]  Let me just dump it there.  Yeah, we figured.  Did we stop, or is it, like, old?  Why don't people go there and, like, pick some shit up?  Like, when you go to the dump, you usually end up taking shit home with you?  There's probably some good stuff out there.  Yeah.  Vince from Bayonne.  Correction.  Opie.  White voters were fans of Obama, but Obama's not a fan of white voters.  Ah, that's what I meant.  I think that's sort of what you said.  Hey, our old pal, Ronnie Madison, is back in the news.  Greg.  Yeah, how you doing, Opie?  All right, man.  Listen, yeah, I was just checking out the website, autoblog, yesterday, 
[00:11:30]  and I saw Ronnie Madison jump between the drawbridge of the tower bridge.  Yeah, there you go.  I forgot.  He did a backflip.  He did a backflip, basically, between the drawbridge.  He did a backflip?  Wow.  Yeah, when it was open, he did a backflip in London.  So, that was it.  This guy's going to die.  We love Ronnie Madison.  We've talked about Ronnie Madison.  He was the guy that, like, landed on top of that building.  Where was it?  In Vegas?  Yeah, Vegas. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, the motorcycle dude.  That guy rules.  Didn't we talk to him?  Yeah, we talked to him.  We're big fans of Ronnie Madison.  Let's get him on the phone and hear about his latest trick.  He loves the show.  What did he do?  He jumped the London Bridge and did a backflip.  As it was opened, I guess it opens up like a drawbridge.  Yeah.  Did he have permission to do that, or he just did it?  I'm sure he got permission, yeah.  Yeah, it's a stupid question.  We'll try to get him on the phone and see what that was all about.  Thank you, sir, for the knowledge.  You got it, boys.  Have a good day.  All right, Greg. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, a giant garbage pile, huh?  Did you see the picture?  Yeah.  They actually have pictures from space of this thing, Danny.  That's what I'm looking for now.  From outer space, but they're saying this pile is as big as Texas.  Yep.  God, we suck as humans.  Actually, I'm sorry.  It's estimated to be twice the size of Texas.  So that's getting close to the size of the United States.  Texas is a big state.  What's it, a pile of?  Garbage.  Garbage.  Plastic and other debris that has been trapped by the currents. 
[00:13:00]  Ah.  From when we dump?  Yeah.  Despite its size and density, the patch is not visible from satellite photography.  What are we going to do about this?  What is it, under the water a little bit?  Well, I'm sure some of the stuff starts sinking.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  The ocean's huge.  It gives a shit.  It'll figure itself out eventually.  There's still monsters down there.  Yeah, it'll turn into something, like a coral reef.  It'll make something out of it.  That's what happens.  The sea knows how to make shit out of our trash.  We sink ships, and it turns into coral reefs. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Condos.  Yeah, it is.  Pretty much fish condos.  It makes the fish very happy when a ship goes down.  Oh, we finally have a place to hang out, instead of just all this vastness.  Yeah.  Yeah, now they can swim around and make little things, and barnacles can go there.  Barnacles.  Fish.  What a boring life a barnacle has.  I'm a barnacle.  And then they just stick on something.  They're there for the rest of their life.  And they're not even special, because there's a lot more barnacles. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, they're packed barnacles.  And if you want it to be the barnacle that moves on and finds its own space, you can't  even do that.  You can't even do that.  You're stuck forever.  Barnacles all wear, I'm with stupid t-shirts.  With the arrow.  And they're all just pointing at each other.  I'm with host.  Barnacles.  Yeah, barnacles are not my friends.  Barnacles stink.  Barnacles are faggots.  People don't like barnacles.  They have to be scraped off.  Yes, you've got to scrape the barnacles. 
[00:14:30]  Ew, look at the barnacle.  Barnacles.  They're awful.  They're like little assholes.  They look like zits that need to be popped.  Barnacle.  Dumb barnacles.  Barnacles are nerds.  Even their name sucks.  I don't like saying it this much.  Barnacle.  What do they do?  Do they just have a purpose?  They barnic.  Oh, they're just a hassle wherever they go.  Pain in the ass.  They make people scrub the bottom of their boats.  Yeah, they slow down people's boats. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You can't play with it.  I want a pet barnacle.  Yeah.  It'll hurt yourself.  You never hear of people with a pet barnacle.  Yeah, my barnacle.  Look, look.  Look at my scrotum.  There's my pet barnacle.  Give me this scratch.  How great would that be?  That barnacles decide they need your ball bag to survive.  Put a stick on there.  Although no one's ever attacked by a barnacle, which is good.  Yeah.  It's kind of nice.  Wow, they're getting ready, though.  Killed in a barnacle attack.  No, they're getting ready.  They're gathering.  Pretty slow. 
[00:15:30]  Let's say how to Wes the trucker.  Wes.  Good evening.  Hi, Wes.  Hi, Wes.  How are you today?  Oh, pretty good, man.  I got a quick story.  When it comes to the ocean, I know Anthony's petrified of it.  Dude, size does not fucking matter, man.  I had a jellyfish.  I was surfing in Camp Hatteras on the Outer Banks.  And this was like 15 years ago.  Went under the wave.  Came up.  Fucking jellyfish straight on my face.  Over the tentacles or over my shoulders. 
[00:16:00]  And fuck.  You think the easiest thing is, all right, dumbass, just go underwater.  And then the jellyfish is off your face.  Fuck no, man.  Since you're in the ocean and it's Mother Nature, you fucking panic.  And you sit there literally for like five seconds going, oh, oh, get it off, get it off.  And then you shit your pants, man.  That's fantastic.  How'd you get the...  Go ahead, sorry.  Yeah, how'd you get it off?  How'd you get it off?  Well, I just went underwater. 
[00:16:30]  I mean, I went underwater and swam away about eight feet.  But just, it's Mother Nature and it's the ocean and every little thing fucking creeps you out.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, jellyfish.  Did it bite you, sir, or no?  Listen to how cute it sounds.  Oh, whatever, did it sting you?  Well, a jellyfish is more of like just like a light burn.  So, they say like, worst case, my eyes could have smoked shut.  But Jimmy would like this.  They said the best thing for a jellyfish is to pee on it. 
[00:17:00]  That's true.  And also, you know, don't misrepresent.  Some of those jellyfish are fucking brutal.  What they could do to you.  The Portuguese man of war in Australia will kill you.  Some of the waters will be strong.  Yeah, that thing will kill you.  They go from a nice itch to killing you and everything in between.  But, sir, you're also saying that your eye swelling shuts a big problem when you're in the ocean.  Yeah, you need your eyes.  You're going to swim to shore, and then you realize four days later you went the wrong direction.  You're headed towards the Indian Ocean. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Jellyfish sucks.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  But while in the Outer Banks, I did not order a bikini teen.  Oh, shit.  That restaurant closed down that served the bikini teenies.  We haven't been to the Outer Banks in a couple summers.  I want to go back there.  How about these jellyfish, eh?  That thing is creepy.  Are you a fan of the jellyfish?  No.  I don't like when I see a jellyfish in the water, and it ruins the whole fucking experience for me. 
[00:18:00]  I can't go in the water.  Because a lot of times, if you get a hotel room at a resort, you're kind of above the water.  So you look out in the morning, and you're like, ah, you go out on the balcony, and you look, and you go, what the fuck is out there?  Oh, shit.  It's just packed with jellyfish.  What about you're already swimming, and you see one, and you're like, oh, look at the little jellyfish.  And you're looking at it like, ah, I'll just swim away from that.  And then you turn to your left, you see another one.  Then you turn back, you realize they're everywhere.  Yeah, they're all around you. 
[00:18:30]  What do you do?  You get the hell out of the water.  You make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  They're not that kind of jelly.  Wait, do you just brush them away, or do you bitch?  No, don't touch them.  How do you get away, though, if you get to swim through them?  Don't they attack you?  Well, you try to swim around them.  But it's crazy.  No, you get the fuck out of the water, because they can't chase you.  You never touch a jellyfish on purpose, Jimmy.  They're awful.  Never.  They fuck off.  If you believe in God, that's cool, whatever.  I'm not going to question your beliefs.  But you look at jellyfish, and you go, what was God thinking? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Was he tired that day?  Was he doing crystal meth?  He just threw a blob together and threw in the water and go, okay, this is how you're going to live your life.  Here it is in the water.  And if you take it out of the water, you just turn into something that doesn't even look like you did in the water.  Right.  Like, where are the eyes?  Where is it shit?  Where's all the parts?  Where's the brain?  Where's the brain?  Like, what do they do?  Watch if we realize that when a jellyfish is out of the water, it turns into a crystallized diamond.  And we never knew that. 
[00:19:30]  With this cancer-curing thing, it just becomes a...  You eat one, and you live to be 170.  Yeah, jellyfish.  And they get fucking huge, too.  Danny's showing us videos.  Is that a lot of them, Danny?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That's a lot of jellyfish.  What do you...  Why would the cameraman not just go and get out of there?  Well, I guess...  I guess he ought to film jellyfish.  Yeah, this might be a safer jellyfish.  It's National Geographic.  It looks like their little logo on the corner, so they don't care.  Nah.  Those guys, he's probably in a jellyfish-proof suit. 
[00:20:00]  Wrapped in Wonder Bread.  They hate Wonder Bread.  Oh, they avoid, like, the plague.  Oh, look at that.  That is fucked up.  That's a jellyfish.  That's life.  It looks like a giant egg, like, with all kinds of...  What's the word?  Cilia coming out of it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like little...  Strange.  ...angel hair pasta coming out of it.  Wow, that's a big one.  That's massive.  It's like, uh...  Holy fuck!  Get out of here!  It's the size of a guy who's petting it!  Stop petting the jellyfish!  What are you doing?  Does the jellyfish even know it's alive? 
[00:20:30]  No.  Because that thing is moving toward the diver.  Like, does...  What is it thinking?  It's not.  It can't think.  What is that thing?  As it swims, it just probably says over and over again,  Thanks a lot, God.  Thanks a lot, God.  This is great.  Thanks a lot, God.  It's like a giant head of a cock.  Yes!  Just kind of swimming through the water.  Yeah, pulsating and...  Throbbing.  Yeah, swelling and unswelling.  That's how a jellyfish moves.  Swells and unswells.  It's like when you, um...  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  When you, uh...  Squeeze and make your dickhead bigger,  and then smaller.  That's what they're doing.  Bigger, smaller, bigger, smaller.  It's a twitching dickhead.  Would you pet that thing?  Oh, fuck.  What, the dickhead?  Sure.  That is horrendous looking.  It's just a nightmare.  It's like a sheet, like a ghost.  It looks...  Yes.  A ghost!  It looks so...  It does look like an underwater ghost.  It looks tiring.  And then you've got the tentacles that hang way down,  so those things are dragging over everything.  You think the other sea life hate the jellyfish and make fun of it? 
[00:21:30]  I'm sure.  If you're a fish, I would make fun of the jellyfish.  Jammer!  Hey, what's up, boys?  Why do you think they got so evil?  They got sick of everybody making fun of them.  Making fun of them, because they're just nothing.  Right.  No defense.  You could kill them by throwing three sheets of loose leaf on them.  They're just fucking...  They're just plasma.  Jammer, what do you got?  Morning, boys.  How you doing there, sweet chicks?  Hey.  Uh, listen, uh...  God, I hope you're an asshole.  What?  Uh, when I was a kid, I used to live down in the Florida Keys, and I did a lot of snorkeling 
[00:22:00]  down there.  Yeah.  And I was snorkeling down on Sombrero Reef, and I was snooping around down there.  It came time to come back up to the surface.  I turned around and looked straight up.  There's a huge skull of hammerhead sharks directly above me.  Fuck.  I'm sure Professor Anthony knows those are man-eaters.  Uh, very rare that hammerheads attack people, sir.  Very rare.  They've got to be big.  They've got to be big to attack you.  Yeah, but very rare that any shark will attack a human.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you imagine how I felt? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, scared shitless.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I did.  Don't get me wrong.  Fuck that.  I was, uh, I was doing a little snorkeling among, um, uh, reef sharks, and they're harmless  too, but, you know, you're scared out of your mind when you see that shit in the water.  Absolutely.  All right, boys.  You guys suck.  Linger longer.  Thank you.  You have to have that feeling when you see hammerhead sharks or any sharks, like, why am  I here?  Yeah.  I'm wrong.  I've got to get the fuck out of here.  I had to bring my own air with me.  How was it?  I brought my own air.  Thanks. 
[00:23:00]  I'm fucked without it.  Let's, uh...  You could just swim around and bite me.  Yeah.  It's not going to last you.  I've got to worry about breathing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fill out.  Fill out.  It won't last you for sure.  You're just sitting there.  Oh, shit.  I've got to wait down here.  They don't bother us.  You don't walk into the boardroom and see a shark with wet stuff all over them.  Yeah.  With a water tank just breathing.  Fucking studying you.  Poking you with shit.  Leave me alone.  Taking little shark pictures with his shitty camera. 
[00:23:30]  Let me see.  Let's go to Matt in Philly.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Pretty good, Matt.  Size does not matter.  There's a little jellyfish.  It's about the size of your thumbnail called an Irukandji.  And if it stings you, it fucks you up and can kill you.  There was a documentary where this woman got a piece of one of the little tentacles on her glove and wiped her face.  And she ended up in the hospital for like two weeks.  Shit.  Is it an allergic reaction or has it hurt all people?  Oh, no, no. 
[00:24:00]  This is the reaction that most people have to them.  And where are these type of jellyfish?  I believe they're off the coast of Australia.  And I think there's a close relative to them off the coast of Hawaii.  But I don't think the ones off Hawaii are as potent.  I got to tell you something about that fucking Australia.  You just don't want to go in the water.  You know what?  You just do not want to fucking go in the water off Australia.  I think I agree with you.  And I'm a water guy, but everything I've heard about Australia, a lot more sharks.  The deadliest jellyfish, sharks, fucking sea snakes. 
[00:24:30]  They got shit down there that just will fuck you up.  I have to agree with you on that, unfortunately.  Stay out of the water, you dumb Aussies.  And I'm pro-water.  I'm pro-water.  I'm pro-water.  I'm con-water.  We'll have to debate it one day.  One day.  Water, no.  You go diving with me one time, and you won't be as scared of the water.  Pussy diving?  Pussy diving?  With Bobo?  With Bobo at the Queens Motor Inn?  Pussy diving at the Queens Motor Inn. 
[00:25:00]  Are you moving in on his girl?  No, I'm leaving him alone.  You are?  Yeah, I'll let him.  You'll let him crash and burn?  I'll let him get really attached.  We should get an update on that.  Then I'll fuck him over.  That was a big segment on the show last week.  We should get an update.  I know.  We should get an update.  And she's got to get a better picture on the internet.  So, jellyfish do not have specialized digestive, osmoregulatory, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory system. 
[00:25:30]  Jellyfish do not have a brain or central nervous system, but rather have a loose network of nerves.  What the fuck?  So, they've got no real...  So, that means no brain, no blood.  No brain, nothing.  It's just kind of this...  They're just mass.  ...loosely based electronic impulses that kind of make it move by instinct.  Does it eat?  Oh, yeah.  It can eat.  Jellyfish got to eat, yo.  Why is it eating if it doesn't have a brain? 
[00:26:00]  How does that work?  It just knows it's got to do something.  So, when it catches something in the tentacles...  But how do you know you have to do something if you don't have a brain?  I'll keep going back to the brain thing.  It like fucks it up.  I think it just is like a...  It's almost like a giant one-celled organism.  Yeah.  Yeah, like paramecium, like they don't have...  Or amoebas, they don't have brains.  Yeah, but they know to eat.  So, why don't we make computers out of jellyfish?  What?  That could be one of the silliest things I've ever heard anyone say. 
[00:26:30]  Think about it, though.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Think about it.  If you don't need a brain to do some stuff,  and it's based on some weird electrical thing...  Oh, make them out of...  All right?  Let's get cracking on that.  Dr. Michio Kaku.  Imagine Apple comes up with this big discovery.  Jellyfish-based fucking chip.  Computers.  Culinary uses.  People eat that shit.  It's got to be an Asian nation.  No one eats jellyfish.  It's got to be some Asian nation.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:27:00]  They mix it up with some fucking noodles or something.  What do they do?  Most of the harvest takes place in Southeast Asia.  There you go.  Anything out of the ocean, they love.  They just love it.  They just love it.  If it swims or goes...  They fucking eat it.  Can't have enough of it.  In China, processed jellyfish are desalted by soaking in water overnight and eaten, cooked,  or raw.  What does it taste like?  The dish is often so shredded with a dressing of oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar.  Well, what does it taste like? 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to have Kenny get me one of those today for lunch.  A jellyfish sandwich?  Yes.  Give me jellyfish on white toast.  With the tentacles just hanging over the side.  Would you eat that?  Would you eat those first?  Oh, God.  Like you're doing maybe some cold cuts or hanging out of the side of your sandwich?  You eat that first?  Would you rather die?  Yes.  I'm not eating jellyfish.  You're starving and there's a jellyfish sandwich in front of you.  What do you do?  All right.  I've got to eat the jellyfish sandwich.  Self-preservation.  G.H., the deli doesn't have it.  I have to fly to Hong Kong.  I'll be right back. 
[00:28:00]  What about you're starving and there's a sandwich in front of you made of cock?  Do you eat the sandwich?  Cock sandwich.  It's a cock sandwich.  Do you starve?  Is it still connected to the gentleman?  Yeah.  Do you starve and die?  Wow.  Did you find a cock sandwich?  Leave it to Danny.  He instantly fucking finds cock sandwich.  There's a cock and balls on a piece of bread.  Yeah.  Would you eat that to survive it? 
[00:28:30]  Let's see.  That's a cock sandwich, too.  Maybe on a hot dog bun.  Cock sandwich.  Let's see.  Is it cooked?  If you don't eat the cock sandwich, you die.  That's a dilemma.  Is it cooked?  For all us homophobes, that's a dilemma right there.  Like a hot dog?  Is it cooked?  Is it cooked?  Like grilled.  Yeah, whatever you have to do to make a taste good.  Yeah.  To get it down.  It could be the tastiest cock sandwich ever when you eat it.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  Look.  You got to dice it up first, right?  So it looks less cock-like?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you put it in a pan, and you fry it around, and then you put in your sausage,  a little sugar, some wine, and there's your cock sandwich.  There's your cock sauce.  You know, Obama did bounce that ball, the more I look at it.  Did he?  Yeah, because what's-his-name had to move forward.  Here's the pitch again.  It's all over the nose.  Watch.  And that would have hit in front of the plate.  Yeah.  Because I think he was saying, leading up to the All-Star game, the only thing he's worried 
[00:29:30]  about, he wants to make sure the ball doesn't bounce in front of home plate.  Yeah, that's embarrassing.  That ball would have bounced in front of home plate if he didn't get a little help.  The funny part is the catcher walking back adjusts his own hat.  Like, he doesn't know what to do.  He's so fucking nervous.  Yeah.  Walking.  Hum, hum, hum.  But he puts his hat on, and it just keeps readjusting.  It's like, what are you doing?  It's on your head.  You don't have to keep readjusting it.  Yeah, it's like you're on a fucking, you're on a monsoon.  Can jellyfish think?  No. 
[00:30:00]  Let's go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Hey, a giant mass that can't think and eat for no reason.  Sounds like E-Rock.  Oh!  Wow.  A brainless mass.  I got to tell you.  Just eat.  Me and Ed walked out together yesterday, which is very rare.  Hey.  And we were laughing the entire way to our cars because of what happened to E-Rock yesterday.  Yes.  Just the concept of what happens to E-Rock makes us laugh so hard, where he's minding  his own business, working his balls off for the show, doing whatever he does. 
[00:30:30]  Half of us really don't know, but we know he works hard.  I assume he's doing something.  And we call him into the studio just to make fun of how awful he is.  Just to shit all over him.  He's busy doing something down the hall.  So now he's got to stop what he's doing.  Which is very important in his world.  Yeah, in his world, it's the most important thing.  Walk down the 50-yard hallway we have here.  Yeah, come in here for the specific purpose to be shat upon by everyone on the program. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  And then he walks away.  Yeah.  All disgusted.  He didn't do anything wrong.  No, he's just trying to get through another day.  Matter of fact, we don't even know he's around because he's out of sight.  No.  But in the back of our brains, we know he's there.  Yeah, he's there.  And we know we need to bring him in to just beat him up.  And so we watch him.  We make fun of him walking down the hallway.  And then when he gets in here, we thoroughly shit all over him. 
[00:31:30]  Call him names.  Make fun of his body.  His brain.  His work ethic.  Everything.  And then send him back on his way to work.  And we were riding down to the elevator yesterday.  And I'm going, we just, we just shit on him for no reason whatsoever.  Mercilessly.  But it's fun.  Most of the time when we shit on Iraq, there's no reason for it.  No.  There's none.  No.  You come with fat, big tits.  Yeah.  All right.  We're talking about monsters. 
[00:32:00]  And the one thing I'm in agreement with Ant, because I do love the water.  I was brought up on the water, basically.  Australia is a place you never want to be in the water.  And Charlie in Staten Island is going to add to that.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Yeah.  Not only do they have the sharks and everything else, but they have saltwater crocodiles that  come out into the ocean.  That's what you need.  Saltwater crocodiles.  Not only do you have to worry about the sharks and the jellyfish that will kill you, you  have to worry about saltwater crocs.  About crocodiles that shouldn't even be in the fucking, that part of the water. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  They have figured out how to get into the saltwater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They like the salt.  That's wonderful.  I'm sure there's.  I like the size of that fucking monster.  I'm sure there's other, other monsters in Australia.  That's just a living dinosaur.  That's all crocodiles are.  If those were extinct millions of years ago, we'd look at pictures and go, holy shit, could  you imagine that walking around?  But it is walking around.  But it is walking around, so we kind of accept it.  Right.  There could be a brontosaurus walking around.  If it was around, we'd be like, holy shit, look, brontosaurus, look how big that is. 
[00:33:00]  There's no way to get a crocodile off you.  No.  There's nothing you can say to that thing which will make it back off.  There's no reasoning with it.  No.  Shit.  Just.  Shit.  I would just.  I would just.  I would buy you a steak.  Don't eat me.  I would just make all sorts of really strange noises hoping that one of those noises means  something to him.  It would mean nothing.  I would not go with the English thing.  I would blow that off immediately.  Look at the teeth on the things.  They're just made for killing things. 
[00:33:30]  And there's nothing in there that has compassion or thought process of being nice.  And why did God decide that the croc teeth have to look like that?  They interlock.  Instead of being nice and straight or something.  They're all like.  Well, it's hard for an orthodontist to put braces on them.  Yeah.  They keep eating the orthodontist.  No one will go near them because they lose an arm.  Yeah.  They've tried.  And they're sneaky.  They lurk under the water with just their nose and eyes above the water. 
[00:34:00]  Just peeking.  You can't even see in that murky, nasty water.  And then all of a sudden they just pop up and, oh, shit, look.  They got my arm and they're ripping it off by spinning around and around.  You think alligators or crocs are ever in a good mood?  No.  You ever.  You think they're.  No.  They're just constantly just fucking pissed off.  In the mood to rip something's limbs off.  Look at them.  It just looks like a rock.  You'd be swimming around going, oh, that rock is.  Ah, the rock is eating me.  What would go through your brain when you realize it's not a rock and it's a fucking crocodile? 
[00:34:30]  Some.  You could fucking.  Oh, my God.  Heart attack instantly.  For a split second, do you think things like we went to the moon and this thing's been just a crocodile for millions upon millions of years.  It's been the same thing.  Hasn't evolved one iota.  We figured out how to, like, take dirt, water, wood, air, rocks, things like that, and craft flying machines out of it. 
[00:35:00]  But when push comes to shove, this monster is killing me.  Oh, you put Buzz Aldrin up against a crock?  All that knowledge he has means nothing.  Doesn't mean anything.  What is he going to do?  You're done.  Done, ski.  How about this as we go to break?  Other animals that are just always pissed off.  Always just ready to eat you.  Always in a bad mood.  And just angry and pissed.  The fat girl.  Never happy. 
[00:35:30]  Never happy.  You think we'll get a little list together today, boys?  Oh, I'm certain there are many other just unreasonable animals.  What about the other side of this?  Oh, shit.  An animal that's happy all the time.  God, that looks cool.  Name an animal that is happy all the time.  In a good mood.  Happy to be alive.  Happy to be here.  Not a hint of being angry or pissed off or miserable.  Can we name one animal?  Whoa. 
[00:36:00]  I was going to go with a kitten, but those fuckers, man.  Awful.  You get them going.  Holy shit.  No, that's pretty funny.  I like when they hunch their back up and puff their tail out and jump sideways.  Little kitten.  They get all mad.  It's adorable.  Bounce into a wall or something.  Oh, it's the cutest thing.  What the fuck are you doing?  It's hysterically cute.  All right, well, think about it.  Maybe there's something there.  Maybe not.  Oh, great.  More about Australia.  This place that everyone says is so terrific, you've got to go visit. 
[00:36:30]  It's a wonderful place.  Bill in Arizona.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Not only do you have all this shit that's in the water, but let's not forget that like  six of the ten deadliest snakes live in Australia and several of the deadliest spiders.  Yes, spiders.  You know, get killed by a fucking spider is embarrassing.  You know, every once in a while you wake up in the morning with a spider bite and you go,  what the fuck?  There was a spider in my room?  But in Australia, that could mean your death.  Yeah.  That's the difference.  If you want to go someplace else, and I can't remember exactly where it is, but it's wherever 
[00:37:00]  bananas come from.  The banana spider.  For years, guys were getting killed by it.  They had no idea what was killing them, and then one day they realized it's this itty-bitty  spider.  Tiny spider and the bananas?  Look, I got goosebumps from that picture that Danny just put up there.  Why?  Let me say what it is.  It's two men docking.  No, it's not.  It's a giant spider eating a beetle or something.  I think it's a pole.  No, it's George.  It's a spider-like pudding. 
[00:37:30]  Those are giant.  When these banana crates and stuff come in?  Yes.  They open up a distance because they'll come in from these other countries, and they're  full of spiders and snakes.  Snakes?  There have been people at the grocery store that have picked up bananas, a bunch of bananas,  and a big fucking creature comes out.  What?  Yes.  It's very rare, but it has happened.  I'm not eating bananas anymore.  That is not even real.  That's a spider that, like, if you saw it, you would just die of fright. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, let's say...  We've got shitty little spiders around here compared to that.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Hey.  There's a show.  I think it's on National Geographic Channel, and I want to say it's called Undersea Monsters  or something like that, but the guy travels the world profiling, like, giant fish, and  there is a relative of a catfish that lives in a high mountain river. 
[00:38:30]  I think it's in Tibet or something like that.  It took six people to pull this fish out of the river, and if the guy was fishing it  for it, his comment was, if this fish drags me under, it will kill me and eat me.  That's a fucking catfish.  I've seen some of those promos for that show, it's these guys that just go in the water and  they're wrestling these giant fucking monster fish, some of them with huge teeth. 
[00:39:00]  Is that what it's called, Hooked?  I think so.  That show?  It looks sick.  You ever see a full-size, is it a grouper down there?  Oh, yeah.  In Atlantis, right?  Yeah.  They have them in the tanks?  Yeah, in the tanks and the giant, that would scare the piss out of me.  Oh, my God.  Those groupers are huge.  They're just too big.  And, you know, you guys, like a previous caller was talking about those banana fires.  I haul ocean containers, and we get them to come in from India and parts of rural China  where there are laws regarding the way things are manufactured aren't so tight, and these 
[00:39:30]  containers have to be fumigated, and, I mean, they'll come in and they'll just pump them  full of fumigation.  And then one day we were unloading a container, and the guy pulls his pallet out, and there  was, like, all these lizards, all these, like, baby snakes, and this spider that was as big  as my hand, it was dead, was hanging from the ceiling.  And they just closed the container back up and had to call the Department of Health and  the Department of Agriculture out because they had no idea how dangerous these things 
[00:40:00]  were, even dead.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  We're watching a two spiders?  Spider fight.  Yeah, we're watching spider fights now.  Spider fights.  You guys ever heard of this website before?  It's called Japanese Bug Fights?  It's called Japanese Bug Fights.  Let's go to Japanese.  That's why Danny's the king of the internet, I'm telling you.  That tarantula, I guess, is, um...  I've seen some incredible upsets.  Oh, some incredible upsets?  Oh, yeah, where you're like, how is that going to beat that?  The tarantula's beating the shit out of that daddy long legs looking thing. 
[00:40:30]  I don't remember.  It's been a while since I've been to this website, but I did spend a good portion of  my day.  Sunk its fangs right in there.  Amazing.  Just sucking them dry.  Can you imagine walking in and you see your roommate jerking off to this site?  What the fuck are you doing?  What's wrong with you?  It's a praying mantis eating a fucking...  Whatever they eat.  Oh, whatever they eat.  I don't know, praying mantises enjoy.  Let's go to Mark in Connecticut.  Mark.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Mark.  The happiest animal, Labrador Retriever. 
[00:41:00]  Does it ever get angry?  No, never.  I haven't seen mine get angry.  I have two of them.  Oh, he might have found the happiest animal.  We're looking for the happiest animal out there.  That's a scorpion against some kind of giant beetle with these giant jaws.  A scorpion's got to sting him, I guess.  The giant jaws.  He's going to have to find an opening.  He's going to...  Yeah.  This is like fucking watching UFC shit.  It's UFC for bugs.  The beetle now in his giant mandibles has the scorpion's claw. 
[00:41:30]  I've got to go beetle on this one.  And he's got him against the wall.  He's really hammering away at this scorpion who can't really get his stinger going.  But he is exposing the beetle, his softer underbelly.  This could be a problem for the beetle.  The scorpion trying to sting him.  As we know, scorpion's much more efficient with stinging from their behind, above them, on their back.  There he goes.  I think the beetle might be stung.  There he goes, right in the neck. 
[00:42:00]  That's it.  The beetle's been stung.  The beetle's been stung.  What an upset.  Oh, he's lifting up the scorpion over his head, though.  Pounding that motherfucker.  Yeah, but it won't be long before that beetle's just paralyzed.  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't get him.  I don't think he got him.  I think he got him in the side of the neck.  If, you know, a bug has a neck.  Yeah.  You know, where a neck would be on something that doesn't look like a fucking monster.  Yeah.  Does this look like UFC or what?  Yeah, look at him.  He's holding the scorpion above his head.  With his mandibles. 
[00:42:30]  And the scorpion now is just fucking trying to find a place to dig that stinger in.  That beetle has giant fucking jaws.  Is that it?  Did he squeeze him to death?  I think it might have been all over.  Oh, beetle wins.  Scorpion's dead.  Wow, he's fucking...  Winner!  Scorpion!  What's this website called?  This is JapaneseBugFights.com.  Winner!  JapaneseBugFights.com.  How great is that?  That is an amazing site.  That's fucked up.  Japanese...  What is this one?  Centipede. 
[00:43:00]  I see a millipede versus scorpion.  Crying bride with shit on veil.  Now, what does the millipede do?  Holy shit.  It's really the aggressor.  The millipede is going after...  That scorpion is very afraid.  The scorpion wants no part of it.  The scorpion wants out.  Scorpion wants to get away from me, creep.  Millipede is biting it.  It just jumped all over the scorpion's back.  The scorpion's really trying to sting it, though. 
[00:43:30]  I think it might have gotten its ass.  Sting it, you fucking douchebag.  He's just running around with a stinger.  He's hiding it.  Now, the millipede, I believe, is not as well armored as the beetle was.  I think the scorpion is stinging the millipede in the head.  The millipede looks a little fucking bent.  Maybe a little too aggressive.  He went...  He might be getting paralyzed here.  How stupid does that millipede feel?  Yeah, he really went in very aggressively. 
[00:44:00]  He's been stung, I believe, five times now by the scorpion.  Make that six.  Seven in the head.  That one went...  He thinks that stinger is a treat dispenser.  Now, look at the scorpion's coming in now,  knowing that I think he's got the upper claw.  Yeah.  Oh, you just have a bunch of feet.  You can't do shit.  Yeah, what do you got?  You got a bunch of feet.  Go fuck yourself.  The scorpion lost again.  No, no.  I think the millipede...  Holy shit! 
[00:44:30]  The scorpion's dead?  How'd he die?  I believe that millipede's poisonous.  This is a replay.  I believe that was when he bit him,  and the millipede must be poisonous.  It's gotta be.  There's another way that's happening.  We're now miripede!  Brain cancer will take down a beetle every time.  Steven has for me, sure.  What is this one?  I don't know.  So you just get hooked,  and you just start watching the ball.  You totally get hooked.  It's like you have to watch everything.  I love this. 
[00:45:00]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  What do we got?  Oh, what was that?  Praying mantis?  A praying mantis,  which is not poisonous,  but has those nutcracker-like claws  against...  Against something in Japanese.  Against a beetle?  That looks like a grasshopper.  That looks like a cricket.  Or a cricket, right?  Oh, well, the cricket's got some pretty big fucking choppers there.  Big head.  That is a big set of choppers.  Wow.  And a little head on the praying mantis. 
[00:45:30]  Looks like Kenny.  Yes.  It's only smarter.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  The cricket-looking thing is ripping apart  the body of the praying mantis,  which is very soft, by the way.  Very soft abdomen  on the praying mantis.  It's got to keep its front...  If it gets on the ground like that,  and that beetle gets its underbelly,  it's all over. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, the beetle,  the cricket-looking thing.  Now it's biting its head off.  I think...  That's it.  That's it.  You sure?  I believe it's decapitated.  I believe the praying mantis  has now had its head chopped off,  chewed right off by the cricket.  Holy crap.  The nutcracker arm's not effective  against the cricket  with its six legs,  four of which are holding the body,  the thorax of the praying mantis,  and chewing its head off at the neck. 
[00:46:30]  Winner!  Cricket!  I don't know if it's...  Not over yet.  I don't know if it's...  Not over yet.  Could be an upset.  Yeah, they'll fucking...  Now they'll switch to the dead cricket  and the fucking praying mantis  running around the ring,  yelling in the camera,  saying how it likes Coors Light.  Fast forward a little bit.  Yeah, fast forward.  Because we've got to get to a break here.  We're watching TV again.  This isn't good.  It's just eating the fucking praying mantis. 
[00:47:00]  I think it's eating it now.  Yeah.  But the praying mantis is too stupid  to know it has no head.  Bugs can just go around with no head.  His head's being eaten.  His body is doing the Watusi.  Did I say that wrong again?  Yeah, that's close enough.  The Watusi.  Watusi.  Oh, look.  It still has its head,  but now the cricket thing  is just nibbling its body.  It's eating it alive.  It's what it's doing.  Yeah, fast forward.  It's now eating its guts.  Let's get to the end of this match.  Wow.  That seems to be it 
[00:47:30]  for the praying mantis.  Winner!  Cricket!  Cricket beats praying mantis.  These Japanese are crazy.  Love them.  I'm going to check that site out.  Japanesebugfights.com  That should be on television.  I would watch it all the time.  Oh, yeah.  That should be on television.  That's, you know,  you've got to keep it PC  for regular TV, though.  Are there a lot of bugs?  Are there only like 10 bug fights?  There's more?  No, well, I mean...  There's a million more.  We've got to take a break, though.  30 of them?  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Japanesebugfights.com  We'll continue. 
[00:48:00]  Opie and Anthony.  So what's that, Danny?  Someone's complaining about the commercials?  All right.  Yeah, I mean, it comes in here and then.  It's not like a huge complaint,  but, I mean, people do go on and on  about the commercial load on this channel,  but it would be nice to remind the folks out there  that it's...  Satellite Radio's commercial-free music.  It's not necessarily commercial-free talk  and entertainment, so...  It would be impossible to do commercial-free talk.  We went, like, an hour. 
[00:48:30]  Well, that's the problem.  If we go an hour,  then we have to do two breaks,  and then it starts seeming like  we're playing a lot of commercials.  We're still...  Did I say that?  I just heard it and got all hungry.  It seems like that the commercial breaks  are a lot longer.  The same amount of commercials  ever since we started on Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  More or less.  I'll take an hour of radio  for eight minutes of commercial  any day of the week.  Is that all it is?  Yeah, I know.  It's really all it is, man. 
[00:49:00]  Eight minutes.  Out of eight minutes?  Yeah.  You just had 60 full minutes of...  It's hard for us to just do  only 20 minutes now.  That's like the way  of the regular radio world.  Yeah.  It's really hard to just do  20 minutes of radio.  I mean, I guess we should,  because then it would feel like  there's a lot less commercials.  And then people would...  No, people would actually be pissed off.  I thought you just took  a commercial break.  I think we learned  a long time ago  that we could never win.  Yeah.  We can never win.  That's why.  You can't win with these 
[00:49:30]  fucking people.  You've got people complaining  that you do four and a half hours  of radio every day  instead of five.  It's just like...  Oh, I know.  That's another one.  Where normally  it's four hours.  That's a normal shift.  See, we tried to explain  that one too,  but I just gave up on all that.  Yeah.  We're actually...  And I know this is going  to sound crazy,  but we're actually doing  more radio  when we go to 1030  than when we used to go to 11.  Mm-hmm.  And I swear to God  that is the God's honest truth.  And we tried to prove it  and explain that to people 
[00:50:00]  and they just...  They can't comprehend it.  No.  We are actually doing more radio.  And not only that,  but I mean...  The reason we had to do  all the way to 11  was because we had  that unusual deal  with regular radio,  satellite radio.  They both wanted,  you know,  their own thing.  The problem, though,  with regular radio,  the show had so many commercials  the first three hours.  Yeah.  So many commercials.  We're actually doing more radio,  but, you know,  but you'll get the instant feedback  every day.  Can't sell these people sometimes.  No. 
[00:50:30]  They don't buy it.  No.  All right.  Well, that means  they're into the show.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  Where do you want to go?  I gave you a whole bunch  of things that we could go to here.  We got two perv stories.  These we got...  Perv stories are great.  Yeah.  They're not audio, unfortunately,  but...  That's all right.  But pick up your workbook here.  You got two guys  that had the perv switch go off.  We love the perv switch.  Perv switch. 
[00:51:00]  And I guess as human beings,  I was telling you,  I guess we should be disgusted  as human beings  by these stories,  but I don't know.  Every time I laugh  at these stories.  Oh, I know.  Every single time.  Because I guess  everyone has  the perv switch,  but it doesn't click.  It's like a circuit breaker,  really.  It's less like a light switch  than it is a circuit breaker.  Right.  Some people have,  you know,  20-amp perv breakers.  Some people have  30-amp perv breakers. 
[00:51:30]  Some people only have  5-amp perv breakers.  So when something happens,  trip, click,  I got to feel those tents.  And they just lose their mind.  Other people could take  a little more,  you know,  sexual stimulation  before that breaker trips.  How great would it have been  to live as a caveman?  Because when you  bop them on the head  and just fuck them in the ass.  Imagine walking around  Manhattan during cave time.  Caveman time.  You see something nice  and you can just take it.  Right.  There's no rules. 
[00:52:00]  Go around there,  get a big nice,  hairy, smelly cave woman.  There's also saber-toothed tigers  and fucking woolly mammoths  eating your friends.  You know what?  You're looking at the positive.  I could clug some ugly,  hairy lady and fuck her.  You could do that now.  Slow down, though.  I mean, you know,  I would take the chance.  You can't,  there's no internet.  You just got to draw  a picture of a buffalo  on the wall  and go,  I don't know what you mean.  It'd be horrible.  Try to describe  like what you did that day  on a wall. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, with like chalk.  Something here.  Here's how I hunted today.  Or I banged a chick  over the head  and fucked her.  Hey, it's chilly.  Let's push that rock  in front of the fucking  mountainside we live in.  It's too cold to go outside,  so let's just shit  against what would be  the kitchen or the parlor.  The parlor.  We have no TV yet,  so let's just shit  where the living room would be.  You're saying  it wouldn't be good?  No!  Because I don't know  when you get a toothache,  you just got to lay there  and chew a piece of fucking bark.  They don't know what to do.  All of a sudden, 
[00:53:00]  your friends are carried off  by big monsters in the sky.  Yeah, turdactyls.  They're dummies.  You're just playing soccer  with a rock  because you can't figure out  how to make it soft yet.  What?  And your friend is dragged away  by a giant bird.  But like you said,  you could just  bop a chick over the head.  Yeah.  Nail that hairy,  fucking,  very mam-like hat.  Unwashed vagina,  she lifts her loincloth  and just shits  in a juniper bush.  She's missing a leg  because she was attacked 
[00:53:30]  by a giant snapping turtle.  She didn't know what it was.  She thought it was an ottoman  so she put her feet up on it.  Why would she think?  Because furniture,  actually the first sign  of civilization  was a Seaman's furniture store.  They found that in the ice.  So you're saying,  no,  this wouldn't be good.  Terrible.  The only advantage  is the ability  is they don't see you  for sexual harassment.  But yeah,  you could go with your urges.  Yeah.  It was completely acceptable  if you saw something  that got you going,  you went with it.  You went.  And to this day,  some people have 
[00:54:00]  that instinct still,  I guess.  Dentists seem to have it a lot  because they,  instead of using  a big heavy club,  they use nitrous oxide  and other anesthetics  to subdue their prey  before they open up the shirt  and start kneading their tits  like so much dough.  You wouldn't want  to live as a caveman?  No.  There's no advantage to it.  None.  There's nothing to do  except survive.  Yeah.  Live.  Everything you do  is to not die 
[00:54:30]  in five minutes.  And you don't even know  why you're trying  to stay alive.  That's the beauty  of being a caveman.  Even other cavemen  you see just fucking,  all they do  is attack you  for no reason.  Yeah, right.  Everything is just ass.  Like it's better,  like you,  you're a stupid caveman.  You're throwing rocks at him.  And meanwhile,  he's figured out  how to sharpen a stick  so you're dead.  He's throwing rocks at him.  And he's like,  look at these guys  are still throwing rocks.  Watch this.  Flock.  Even fucking spear 
[00:55:00]  right through you.  Even having sex  is a hassle  as a caveman.  Where do you lay?  There's no bed.  You're going to lay on rocks.  You poke you back  on a crude tool.  Crude.  Fucking horrible.  I bet they fucked  on like  animal hide.  Yeah.  So you're just  laying there  on some smelly  dead animal hide.  Because you know  it's not processed  very well.  They were stupid.  Yeah.  There's just rotting  meat underneath it.  Rotting meat  laying on top of it too.  Maggots all over you.  You think there was 
[00:55:30]  ever pleasure  as a caveman?  Or just everything  was just one big pain  in the ass?  Like she sits down  and her vagina  is just on the ground  on a dirty rock.  And what do you think?  She's scrubbing that thing  knowing it should be clean?  No.  Who was the first asshole  that decided  I need to lick that?  Oh, wow.  There had to be one.  There had to be one.  Do you think of some  instinctive caveman thing  like dogs go around  and start lapping away? 
[00:56:00]  Do you think of  something like that?  There had to be one guy  that was the first.  He had to like have  no sense of smell  or something.  God damn.  I'll tell you what it was.  It was because  cave women never got wet.  They always have dirt  and rocks in their vagina  from swatting.  So one caveman went  look, every time  I put it in  it hurts  so he just licked it  to probably make  the opening moist  to make sex easier.  Yeah, to get dirt off it.  Yeah.  With his bad teeth  horrible caveman breath.  Ugh. 
[00:56:30]  You know what?  Jesus.  That might be the real answer  right there.  I think it is.  And then she probably  went like  like  like  like it felt good.  Yeah.  And she grabbed  the back of his head  and kept it there  and he's like  woke up telling his friends  how his jaw hurts.  Yeah.  All night I was licking that.  But he noticed  she wasn't being cunty  for the next couple days.  Stupid caveman.  They really wear boobs.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  I love how  your friends  are just  fucking  friends are just  getting eaten.  Where's Ted?  He was devoured  by something  that fucking  flew out of a tree.  Yeah, they got  those giant  like bears.  Bears now  are fucked up.  Yeah.  Bears back then  giant  and like  saber tooth tigers  tigers now  fuck you up.  Saber tooth tiger  forget about it.  Would you even attempt  to make friends  as a caveman?  What do you do?  How do you do that?  Right.  Come over  you could be the 
[00:57:30]  friendliest looking guy  and the guy would just go  and clock you on the head  with a giant boulder.  Oh, just came over  to say hi.  Figured maybe we could  pool our resources  and clunk  dead.  His skull split open.  Always squatting  you using two hands  to do something.  That's what they would do  was always squat  with their balls  by the dirt like  pounding a rock  into something  to make fire.  Bunch of douches.  Dumb ridges  on their eyebrows  no hats.  No hats!  How do they keep  the sun out of their eyes  no visors? 
[00:58:00]  That's the best invention  fuck the wheel  the sun visor.  They didn't have hats  they certainly didn't  no shades  nothing  no sunglasses  yeah  God that hat is suck.  What the fuck  is that funny?  Dirty  you had  you're full of  filthy vagina  it's pretty much  what you had  that's the only plus  you could drag  a filthy vagina  into your cave  and just have sex  with it  at will  do you think  they ever had  a chance  to just relax  for one moment 
[00:58:30]  just to go  no  instead of worrying  if their friends  were going to be  eaten by monsters  a fucking  three toed sloth  came in  with giant fangs  and ate his children  the second he relaxed  oh fuck  why did I relax  yeah he's like  oh fuck  now I lost my family  should have pushed  the boulder  against the opening  again  4am to 4.07am  was their leisure time  you could do  whatever you want  from 4am to 4.07  and that's when  15 of them died  and then what  happened the rest  of the time Jimmy 
[00:59:00]  it was all work  and fighting for your life  4 to 4.07  all you had to do  was fend off bats  returning to the  same place you live  that was considered  relaxing time  just keeping fruit  and vampire bats  off your loved ones  ah shit  I don't want to  let this bit go  I love this one  history lesson  we're giving you  history lesson  it's so true though  it is  I mean come on  how many years ago  is that too  I mean in earth time  it's not that long ago  100,000 years  am I crazy  it's like 100,000  couple hundred thousand  what kept them 
[00:59:30]  like wanting to live  if it was such a hassle  instinct  the same thing  that keeps a crocodile  going  there's no real thought  to it  yeah they don't like  they just know  they have to keep  being killed  keep living  yeah  it's just  dying isn't good  and it hurts  back then  it probably hurt  every time  no one had a peaceful  you know  he was surrounded  by his family  he went peacefully  in the night  no  his legs were torn off  and he sat there  bleeding to death  as some dummy  tried to put a leaf 
[01:00:00]  over his fucking  thigh bone  that was sticking out  he died doing  what he loved  being disemboweled  by a sabertooth tiger  I guess  God needed  another hairy dummy  exactly  God needed  another Ugg  steam for the wretch  now everyone's in  everyone's in  on the cape man  but  do you think  they looked at  shit dropping  out of each other's  asses like dogs  no that was the first  the guy  the first word  was Carvel  someone didn't  someone didn't know 
[01:00:30]  what it was  he thought it was  a delicious snack  he went over  and his friends  were like  what the fuck  are you doing  that's terrible  stuff  that's shit  what are you doing  with it  and he was shitting  his fingers  feeling stupid  like ugh  tried to act like  it was a joke  that's how they  learned  someone is asking  where is  someone is asking  where is Ted the caveman  I thought of that  but Ted was ruined  no but Ted was killed  Ted was killed  Ted got killed  early in this episode  for Ted  Ted had a cameo  in this  yes  I was very angry 
[01:01:00]  when I was a caveman  there was this stuff  that was very hot  so I threw water on it  and they got very mad at me  what's this caveman doing  nothing  nothing of important  he's beating something  with a rock  with both of his hands  and now licking it  but that lead tusk  going to the moon  you figure it out  yeah right  what the fuck  how's their answer  for everything  beat it with a rock  yeah just hit it  with a rock  and everything  will be fine  imagine having  a fucking wisdom toothache  I mean back then  your wisdom teeth  were probably very necessary  to chew  but a bad toothache 
[01:01:30]  they probably just  hit it with a rock  fuck it  cancer  but hurts  bad eyesight  all these weird things  we take for granted  do you think they had  those diseases back then  yeah  yeah  sure they did  well you think  it's like a product  of civilization  and industrialization  and things like that  no I think they probably had it  what was life expectancy  back then  oh yeah  probably fucking  20 years old  you were the fucking  old man  you know it's fucked up though  you go back  a couple hundred thousand years 
[01:02:00]  to like Cro-Magnon man  or something  the brain capacity  not different  the same fucking  capacity for learning  in that stupid mind  is the same brain  that yeah  built the lunar module  went to the moon  just had to kind of  work up to that  by hitting things  with rocks  and realizing  you know  okay  now if I  if I put a stick  on the rock  it hits harder  I don't understand leverage  but I know  that this hits harder 
[01:02:30]  if I do this  and then you just  kind of kept  going and going  and a couple  hundred thousand years  later you're going  you know  hey  tranquility base  we're going to the moon  yeah  fucked up man  damn is that funny dude  but filthy vagina  and your friends  being torn to pieces  people want to know  about caveman periods  cavewoman periods  there Jimmy  wow  they probably  freaked out at that  they must have just  pummeled her with a rock  yeah they all knew  hit her with rock  they probably had  one corner of the cave  that smelled like pennies 
[01:03:00]  that's where they would  have to go  just lay there  and bleed out  well they'd probably  use the blood  for something  face paint  with the kids  with fucking finger  paint with it  they were just creeps  they didn't know  what it was  they got excited  because Nana was  having her period  that was crayons  for kids  the medicine man  would use it  for something  the fun they would  have with period blood  they all look like  Frank Zappa  a bunch of creeps  let's say hi to Tom  in Chicago  Tom  hey guys  how's it going  take it to another plane 
[01:03:30]  let's imagine  we have an afterlife  are we going to  have to hang out  with these freaky ass  hairy ass creeps  guys good point  every time you walk  by one of them  they just go  you're welcome  right  fuck we get it  right  you lived  you have to hang out  with humans  from all the past periods  right good point  what the fuck  would that be like  that's why that  whole heaven thing  where everybody  you know  hangs out  and it's peaceful  and nice  it doesn't make sense  what about the cavemen  do they all of a sudden  become smart in heaven 
[01:04:00]  you'd have to hang out  with a lot of cavemen  and a lot of proper people  yeah  because they spoke  eloquently  so is it segregated  I don't know  the cavemen hang out  and then the  you know  you hang out  with your type of people  and shit like that  I think they just  keep the cavemen  in like the Detroit  area of heaven  what is it  well  Jesus  later  and why  by the way  why would I say  the streets are lined  with gold  because that someday  became  a soft metal  that we liked  what about stuff  what if the cavemen 
[01:04:30]  thought the afterlife  should just be lined  with shirt  with shirt  they don't know  what shirt is  I was going to say  shit and dirt  just very sharp rocks  you know when you're  in the caveman part  of heaven  it's just like  shit  rocks  and mammoth hide  pictures of a big circle  with yellow light  coming off  because they worship it  it's like it's a star  you fucking assholes  not a fucking living being  it's just a big thing  of gas  it keeps you warm  and then it burns out  what is this guy doing  is he dying  probably dying  I'm looking at a caveman 
[01:05:00]  this is some bad caveman movie  or something  and this guy seems to be  coughing up blood  yeah and they're all  rubbing his head  that's all they could do  for you back then  rub your head vigorously  no idea what to do  here eat this  you know  it's fucking a blade of grass  god damn  there were some  weren't there some examples  of some crude brain surgery  that they tried  on some of these  wow really  yeah like where they saw  like holes  in the skull  skulls heads  that's probably speculation  that just fell on  a very sharp around  yeah it's probably  they died 
[01:05:30]  it's just a war injury  yeah  so anyway  getting back to  current time  we still have cavemen  living out there  yeah  for our enjoyment  which one do you want first  man gets too close  for comfort  in checkout line  or nude man  assaults roommate  nude man  assaults roommate  that sounds  that sounds fun  all right  that's california  a stun gun  had to be used  to subdue a man  arrested monday  on suspicion  of chasing his landlord  around while nude 
[01:06:00]  and demanding oral sex  from her  oh from her  okay  right  i thought it was a guy  on guy action  that is a fucking  perv switch going off  he's running around  nude  demanding  demanding oral sex  from her  that's nice  i'm sure she must have  checked his references  before he moved in  yeah  what did this guy  expect her to go  all right  all right  you convinced me  all right  you're naked  jonathan 49 
[01:06:30]  was found to be  under the influence  of meth  okay  when deputies arrived  um  how do you have a boner  on meth  maybe he didn't  yeah  maybe he just wanted  her to suck it  and make it hard  yeah  that's probably why  he was all pissed off  couldn't get a rod  he's accused of  assaulting his roommate  and then chasing  his landlord  around the home  oh so  assaulting the roommate  then found the landlord  okay  while nude  and demanding oral sex  from her  uh  he was under arrest  in the backseat  of patrol car  deputy said  he became combative  and damaged  a rear door window  oh he went for the kick out 
[01:07:00]  they go for the uh  i love the kick out  they would his head too  they did they like doing that  i see that on cops  and then they had a stun gun  on him so he wouldn't  injure himself further  let him injure himself  yeah who cares  why is it your responsibility  to make sure he doesn't  fuck himself up more  yeah and he gives himself  fucking cerebral hemorrhage  and then the uh cops gotta  uh get in trouble  cause they didn't  oh  protect them  uh  well uh  charlie in philly's  got a good point here  charlie  charlie  what's up  b-b-boys  yeah  charlie 
[01:07:30]  our baby charlie  you guys are  underestimating the cavemen  cause didn't they make  funny commercials  they are fun  those commercials are fun  for geico  yeah  so funny  and then they made it  into a tv show  i know  i know  something happened  when was that  like something stopped  those  what happened when the  caveman show was on  that interfered 
[01:08:00]  was it some kind of  big news event  yeah i think it was  that it kind of pushed  them back  it wasn't 9-11  i don't think it was  that long ago  it was uh  7-5  it was something  that english one i think  right yeah  i don't know  but it was something  that pushed them back  i remember the caveman  sitcom and something  happened  no clue  are they're now  uh  treating jackson's death  as a homicide  yeah  homicide is a pretty 
[01:08:30]  um  well i think  open term  it could just  it just means  that somebody  was uh  killed  by something  i think  i think what's  going to come out  they're going to  they're going to  realize that he  couldn't possibly  inject the  the drugs  that killed him  because of all the  other levels of drugs  in his body  so someone had to  inject him officially  yeah it could be  an accidental  that killed him  right so they  committed a homicide  by accident  technically it's a  homicide  even though you know  this doctor  wow  was working for  jackson  but it might have 
[01:09:00]  been on purpose  which would have  been  no  murder  yeah  they were talking  about that last  night  like yeah  i mean there was  no reason to kill  him  yeah  you know because  people like well  you know who  who was going to  benefit from his  death  well you don't  know maybe just  some fucking you  know hey i'm the  guy that fucking  killed michael jackson  doctor guy you know  right like i'm sick  of this motherfucker  i'm just gonna shoot  him up and be done  with this  there's no way he  could have injected  himself with a  morphine drip  he was too sick 
[01:09:30]  sam  wow jimsy  detective monahan  should investigate  all the insurance  policies taken out  by latoya and the  other androgynous  things that were his  brothers slash sisters  jimsy  that's right  so how do you know  though jimsy uh  that uh he wasn't  murdered though  because debbie rowe  told me while she  was shoving cheeseburgers  into her face  is there a witness  maybe  yes it was blanket  he was hiding  behind a bevy of

[01:12:00]  jimmy  oh the strike  okay  i think i think  the caveman show  killed itself though  yeah that was  that was a dumb idea  i think you're right  what a dud  they weren't even  using the commercial  caveman guy  oh they didn't say  homicide  they said  homo side  oh  thank you  from buffalo  peto side  let's go to tom  in connecticut  tom  hey what's up  boys  hey tom  happy birthday  jimmy  oh you  i just wanted to  let you know 
[01:12:30]  anthony you were  right  they did some  sort of primitive  brain surgery  back in the caveman  days it's called  trepanation  they used to take  sharp rocks and  make holes in the  base of the skull  to treat headaches  and brain swelling  all right let's  slow down  how does that  treat a fucking  headache  taking a rock  and banging it  on the backside  of your head  they probably  took a sharp one  and twisted it  like a drill  oh yeah that's  going to help  a headache  no anesthesia  fucking hair  and dirt  in the rock  oh fuck  did you wash  the rock  yes  we all spit 
[01:13:00]  on it  we use  tight  we use  fucking  go ahead  you talk  sorry sir  i apologize  it probably made it  worse in the short term  but after you  drained the fluid  they probably felt a lot  better if they didn't  die from infection  afterwards  yeah i'm sure they  all did  they probably decided  that the period juice  like cleaned the rock  yeah  you know well enough  to use in surgery  or tiger piss  just some awful thing  yeah some horrible  the first guy thought  that the bees  he does a hornet's nest  it was a buzzing sound  it was peaceful  so he put it on the 
[01:13:30]  back of his friend's wound  then they all got stung  and they're like  ixnay on that one  that'd be a big  put that in the negative  column  they're all swollen  with bee stings  you gotta think  they did a little  live and learn  back then  dude the first guy  that saw a hornet's nest  probably thought  it was like a big pussy  hanging in the tree  put his  i'll go fuck that  put his cock in there  yeah he thought  the bees were  inviting him in  all right guys  have a good day  i can't get enough  of the caveman  god the brutality  they had to live with  back then  and the dumbness 
[01:14:00]  just being stupid  having to try to live  when you're so stupid  what was the definition  of smart  back in caveman  days there jimmy  the definition of smart  i don't i don't know  if you're a caveman  i mean you looked around  and went wow  that caveman is smart  yeah because you know  there's there are idiots  now and smart people  so i guess back then  there you know  there was a smart caveman  whoever would duck  when they threw a rock  at him was considered  a genius  that guy is such a  he gets hit in the head  before he can even 
[01:14:30]  finish his sentence  because they would see  a rock coming  and open their mouth  and they should catch it  knock it out  their teeth  that they desperately need  yeah because i remember  the old laugh ends  where people would  throw food into each  other's mouths  and they wanted to try it  all right  stupid  what was a prank  back then  what do they consider  a prank  everything was a prank  like you know  you'd paint like  you'd put like  food on your friend  just so a wild animal  would attack him  and remove a limb  all your friends  would laugh  ah look at him  dig a hole in front  of your friend's cave  and then put sharp sticks 
[01:15:00]  in the hole  cover it with leaves  yes it was  one of his children  would have fucking  just impaled themselves  you'll laugh  sharp sticks  dummies  fucking idiots  how are we related  to them  i don't know  we came out of that  though  you'd paint the back  of a woman's ass  well like you'd paint  a fake vagina  on the face  of a sleeping tiger  and your friend  would just jump over  and start humping it 
[01:15:30]  and have a rude awakening  not just an awakening  a rude awakening  very rude awakening  yeah yeah  and he'd know  he was had  when he started  humping and he heard  and he was like  oh fuck  alright well  I'm already committed  the fucking saber tooth  tiger breath  smells better  half the time  the tiger  wouldn't even eat him  he'd think  there's no way  this guy could really  be trying to  fuck my face  there's no way  a man is trying  to fuck my face  he has nothing  but a loincloth  and they're all laughing  at the tiger  walking around  with a picture  of a vagina  on his face  they don't think  it's funny  all the tiger friends 
[01:16:00]  are laughing  he has a human  pre-cum  on his fucking  snout  slept a little  too heavy  did you  Harry  oh fuck  can't get enough  of the caveman  yeah  why don't we  well we got  a current day  caveman story  another perv switch  going off  man gets too close  for comfort  in checkout line  so you got  a northwest  Indiana man  facing a misdemeanor  battery charge  after getting too  close to a woman 
[01:16:30]  in the checkout  line in front  of him  now what  is too close  well this guy  55 allegedly  ground  they used the  word ground  he allegedly  ground his  genital area  in the buttocks  I just picked it  like circular  right  circular motion  real hard  pressed against  it  what the fuck  do you grab  her hips too  to kind of  get more leverage  dude these stories  funny every  fucking time  someone has to  say  think this  just like oh 
[01:17:00]  we have a horrific  story to tell you  this morning  this is comedy  this guy looked at  it he's online  he's on fucking  line  he looked at  this chick's ass  and just said  I have to rub  my cock on that  if I was the chick  I'd be flattered  yeah  your ass is so good  that the guy  circuit breaker snapped  not only is he touching  your buttocks  his genital area  he's grounding  he's just  what is the definition  of ground 
[01:17:30]  it's a past form  of to grind  so  grinding  he's not actually  mushing his dick  into it  it's not actually  pumping  it's mushing  it's mushing  I think it's mushing  and then a circular  motion or some  pumping  you're grinding  you're pushing  he's dry humping her  god damn  on the line  he saw that ass  he saw that ass  groceries  what kind of store  was it  dude this poor woman  alright listen  55 allegedly 
[01:18:00]  grounded general area  into the puttocks  of the woman  standing in front of him  in line  Friday  at Dollar Tree  in Griffith  what the fuck  is a dollar tree  everything for a dollar  that would be a nice  cheap place  poor woman  just trying to survive  save a few bucks  save a few bucks  to get ten items  ugh  yeah  the woman said  she stepped forward  to separate herself  from the man  because she assumed  it was accidental  but he did it again  if you touch me again  I'll bash you in the head  with my umbrella  the woman is quoted  my one dollar umbrella 
[01:18:30]  which has a big hole  in the middle of it  that's why it's a dollar  it funnels the water  onto you  it's like holding  it's like holding  an upside down funnel  and all the water  hits you  it pours on it  yeah  on top of your dumb head  they've only sold  one copy  it was to her  copy  she carries it  like the fucking penguin  she's gonna hit him  with it  stupid whore  she was wearing  her dollar shorts  and had a hole cut  in the back  and that's why  he thought it was okay  because he had  this dollar pass 
[01:19:00]  with no zipper  the hole in the front  his cock just flopped out  yeah what are you doing  spending a buck  take this  he knew she couldn't  afford a lawyer  she's at the fucking  dollar tree shopping  he can do whatever  he wants  this guy  his last name is  Deloney I guess  then ran from the store  past Kmart  with several customers  in pursuit  now they're running  after the guy  an angry mob  he told the police officer  he accidentally  bumped into the woman  but then mistakenly  thought she liked it  and was coming on to me  so I intentionally  rubbed on her  the second time 
[01:19:30]  I'm sorry  the police report states  he thought she liked it  yeah  that's good  online  just gonna sit here  online  and grind my cock  on a patron  oh my god  it's that perv switch  I wonder  I would love to see  what her ass looks like  yeah we got a picture  of her ass  that made him  do that  probably in shorts  yeah it's probably  looking you know  and you're just looking  going god damn  wouldn't it be great  to just rub my cock 
[01:20:00]  against that  and then before you know  what you're doing  and go what am I doing  I'm rubbing  now everyone's angry  with me  I have to run  I think it's called  frottage  frottage  yeah I used to have  a fetish for that  when I was in high school  I would rub  like try to rub  my dick  or my hand  the back of my knuckles  against an ass  that was always  as a kid  you just wanted to do that  sure yeah  kind of feel  a little something  that's why I always liked  when they opened up  those gym doors  and did the square dancing  you know  you could get some frottage  done there  that's for sure  swing your partner 
[01:20:30]  round and round  the word sounds awful  frottage  engaging in frottage  can I get back to you  I'm a frottagist  professional  he was arrested  for forcible frottage  just fucking  clammy hands  when you're holding  the girls  on the girls  side of the gym  when you had  a square dance  and your hands  would be all clammy  because you're so nervous  and you're touching  a girl  that was it  it's like fucking  sex back then  that was sex  how about we  slowly get into this  yeah  like most people  didn't touch 
[01:21:00]  a girl yet  no you hadn't  touched a girl  and they think  it's a good idea  to now have  just full contact  with the girl  on the other side  of the big doors  complete boner  how about we just  start with quick  hand holding  or something  dude boner  not even a question  it was such  nervous  like heavy breathing  just touching  like skin  and square dancing  you do that thing  where you gotta  promenade  your partner  and you put your arm  around the girl's waist  oh my god  and then your arms  are kind of crossed 
[01:21:30]  and holding each other's hands  so you're holding her waist  and you're kind of walking  and you're next to each other  and you're 11 or 12 right  because it was grammar school  this was like really early  so that would be  something you brought  to the show  that would be  hardcore sex  that's sex  that's hardcore sex  for an 11 year old  just as exciting  just as exciting  it was crazy  and then you do  other things  like the swing  your partner  you know  where you put  your arms together  the crook of your arms  and just any skin 
[01:22:00]  to skin contact  was incredible  and then you're holding  each other's hips  it was fucked up  you guys ever play  crab soccer  in school  like junior high school age  no  it's basically like  you just kind of  bend over backwards  oh I got it  you get in that crab position  yeah kind of like  that backwards  the backwards  exorcist  walk down the stairs  and you play soccer  like that  well they let us play  co-ed crab soccer  with the chicks  and I mean  what are you wearing  in gym class  so we would just  we would just  we never like played  we didn't care about the game 
[01:22:30]  we would just follow  the hottest chicks around  it was called  you've got crabs  from us jumping off  I couldn't believe  that they let us  do that  in school  coke logic  and a bunch of others  it's inline  not online  what  oh that  I posted a picture  of a bunch of girls  online for the bathroom  and I said  online  they're like  no it's inline  you could stand online  or inline  is it an old school term  at this point  because the argument 
[01:23:00]  that I read was  you go online  as far as like  computers and stuff  both acceptable  and it's inline  I've never said inline  I've always said  online  it's probably  I'm going to say  probably inline  is correct  when you think of  doing things in order  in a line  but you can also  be on a line  yeah there's an  imaginary line  between you  and where you have to go  and you stand on it  that's true  what is the proper one  do we have like  an English douche  that can call us  on the queue 
[01:23:30]  on the queue  you're cued  you're cued  that's what the English say  I still say  so I was standing  in the queue  I still say it's online  a lot of people say  it's definitely inline  what is it  let's solve this argument  for once  both  is probably  completely acceptable  both are probably  completely acceptable  I imagine maybe  the youth of America  because of computers  don't say online  they say inline  look at the people  saying I always  say inline  I was standing  on line  for hours  I was standing  in line 
[01:24:00]  for hours  both work  hey do you know  what I mean  when I say it  then go fuck yourself  they beat me up  over the weekend  for it too  it's an argument  we have  from time to time  on the show  perf switch  caveman  I'm on your mother  I'm in your mother  there is a difference  okay  yeah  I'd rather be  in your mother  right  smartest caveman  the answer  came in  came in  what happened  what is it 
[01:24:30]  the smartest caveman  was Howie the caveman  oh okay  of course  he was the guy  that invented  rip me off  plane crash  and I ran  yeah we did hear  about that  online  everybody dead  inline  but that's a  case of them  just using  old planes  no one cares  by the way  it's you know  168 people  dead  but it's a far  away place 
[01:25:00]  that we really  kind of don't like  the country  so we don't care  as much  see how we are  as people  it's far away  it's a plane crash  oh  bunch of people  were in there  going alright  I'm flying somewhere  plummeted  horrible  and we go  like  but it's not  as covered  as it would  be if it  was an  American crash  or that  France  crash  Reggie Jackson  looks like he  could still play  what the fuck  I'd love to  interview him  Reggie  love Reggie 
[01:25:30]  god damn  I love Reggie  what a round  head Reggie  has  fucking love  Reggie  Reggie  big round  head  is he sick  of here  Mr. October  though  probably not  I don't know  that's like a  well I'm watching  the interview here  and it says  Mr. October  he was clutch  I would love  to interview Reggie  he was just like  you know  A-Rod  A-Rod and Reggie  same person  as far as  October goes  right there  fucking Reggie  oh yeah  Jeff has the  proper pronunciation  of frottage  good evening  hey

[01:28:00]  I was in  Florida  how did we  lose the  mustard thing  it was just  pure ketchup  in the New York  area  I like just  the pure ketchup  I went down  the floor  I got a  hamburger  they put  mustard on  it  I brought  it back  I'm like  I didn't  want this  oh so you're  with me  yeah and they  thought I was  retarded  they're like  that's what  it comes with  and I'm like  you were both  right  you were both  right  Jimmy  I gotta say  Jimmy has been  beyond quick  the last couple  of days  beyond quick  I like having  both to be honest  with you  I like ketchup  and mustard  I love both  yeah  yeah  I don't know  it gives too much  of that tang 
[01:28:30]  to a burger  no  I like ketchup  let's keep our  pizza thin  we don't ask for  much out there  yeah  no mustard on  the hamburgers  and let's keep  the oh pizza  god damn it  I love pizza  so bad too  have you been to  that place by our  house that serves  like wheat pizza  it's not great  what  it's wheat pizza  with low fat cheese  it's not  it's better than  why then have it  it's an excuse  I probably eat  the healthiest  on the show  but  I know  I think  people that drink 
[01:29:00]  O'Douls  Anthony probably  eats healthier  than me  even  sometimes I go  on my benders  but there's things  like  when you're gonna  eat pizza  just fucking  eat pizza  that's how I live  I eat enough  salads  and dumb grilled  chicken and all  that crap  just don't eat  half the fucking  pie  and don't have  it like a week  in a row  I know  when I go pizza  I'm all in  I don't think  about fucking  eating right  health  nothing  they say  you have to  have a cheat  day  I do 
[01:29:30]  it's called  a week day  I'm on a  seafood diet  I only eat  mollusks  mollusks  if you're gonna  have pizza  though  if you're gonna  have pasta  probably the  barnacles  no one eats  barnacles  imagine a bowl  of cold barnacles  there's your  breakfast shit  dick  put some milk  on it  crunchy  your mouth  is bleeding  disgusting  paint chips  from a boat  on your  bowl of 
[01:30:00]  barnacles  god damn  it  pizza  in my  fucking  brain  now  I love  a nice  hot slice  where you pick  it up  and the front  just kind of  drips over  and you have to  hold it over  your mouth  to get the  front of it  then it's  scalding hot  and you remove  four layers  of skin  the cheese  is dripping  like that  fucking  cuckled video  we watched  yesterday  dinner time  man of  color  pulling  his  giant  penis  off  your  slice  you don't  know which  way to go  you win either way  what was the guy's name  dinner time  it's dinner time 
[01:30:30]  but pizza has to come with a little extra sauce right  no  you guys  you don't go with the extra sauce  never  that's what kills me  I'm also from the school of don't put anything on your fucking pizza  no pepperoni  no no I don't mean like that  like if you get pepperoni things like that  but if you get pizza  I see people that go to the table  and then they grab that fucking pepper shaker  and they do that  and then they get the salt  and it's like  the guy  the guy has a recipe  for pizza  that he says is good  if you wanted that shit on it 
[01:31:00]  he'd have to put it on it  a little garlic salt on your face  no  what's wrong with you  I like garlic  what's wrong with me  why didn't the guy put it on there  a little extra oregano  nothing  how about a little red pepper  right out of the oven  right into my mouth  garlic dude  because people  people have different tastes with garlic  some people don't like garlic  but they love the pizza with garlic  a little garlic salt  oh my god  no  god  that's true  let's get a pie  I would love to  we say pie in this area  people don't understand  Brian Regan's got a great bit about that  you want to split a pie 
[01:31:30]  like what  pie  apple  it is a regional thing to say pie  what do they say in uh  I guess pizza  yeah  so if you say you know  you want to get a pie  uh people think  you know  you're getting a fucking pie  my favorite thing to do in LA  is go  boy I really missed  the New York pizza  yeah you know  you can't get good pizza out here  it's the water  it makes the dough  I don't know  shut up  it's the mafia  you heard the water thing too  of course  it's nonsense  a stupid water thing 
[01:32:00]  you don't want to take a ship over  some New York water  oh my god  yes  that's the fact that some guy  will break your shins  with a fucking pipe  if you don't use the dough and cheese  that he's providing  that's why the pizza in New York  is great  that's right  fucking LA they don't have that  like you want to put a pineapple on it  okie doke  I know  that's another thing  you're going to get a really good product  when someone's  you know  looking over your shoulder  the entire time you're producing it  yeah  out here if you don't buy the proper cheese  you don't lose your customers  some man puts cement on your feet  and throws you into a river  while you're still alive 
[01:32:30]  I hate  when they put fucking  like pineapple on  I don't like any of that shit  you know what  it's so god damn good  there's a place  uh  by where I live  when you said  you know what's so god damn good  I just wanted to scream  cum  you ever  you ever have a slice of  uh  ziti pizza 
[01:33:00]  oh that's good shit  dude  that's good shit  it's like ziti  piled on top of fucking pizza  and it's got the  that shit is good  that is like  you're done with the slice  and you're ready to explode  it's just fucking  you're all full  oh it's so good  how good is your shit  the next day  after a nice slice of pizza  oh it's wonderful  little tubes of ziti shit  coming out  just sliding out  wonderful  no pushing needed  uh  I guess uh 
[01:33:30]  Brian admitted  oh we just lost  fucking Brian  and he had a Fargo accent  we love the Fargo accent  oh fuck  damn  alright well  hopefully we lost it  for a good reason  like the front of his  fucking vehicle  smashed into something  made of cement  I hope right now  his hand is still  holding the phone  but his fucking arm  is severed from his body  like his head right now  is against the piece of cement  and his arm's in a ditch  our goofy voices  are coming out of it  out of his phone  his lifeless fingers  are just unclutching slowly  his arm's white 
[01:34:00]  just bled out  it's fucking hilarious  got a few mullet hairs  on the shoulder  someone's screaming  in horror  and hearing us laughing  out of his phone  the man's hand  is talking  oh I see  the phone  oh is that great  what the hell is wrong  with us  ranch dressing on your pizza  that came in a few times  what  no way  no  no fuck  no  are you insane  no way  no  stop it  horrendous  no  I'd rather eat marmalade  out of an asshole  it's not good 
[01:34:30]  I doubt that  marmalade  no I like a good ass  who's asshole  you just like regular  you like the regular ass flavor  yeah  depends on the marmalade too  you don't want to eat  mushroom flavored marmalade  out of someone's ass  I like original recipe asshole  I do too  I don't need any  doodads  I like extra crispy  I like original recipe  with a little gym sweat  how many miles on the bike  alright come over  get over here  well now we gotta go to break 
[01:35:00]  nice wafting coming out of there  and people are gonna bitch  cause we're gonna have to  you know take a little break now  you know too bad  we talked for fucking  it's about 50 minutes we did  we used to do on terrestrial radio  what 18 minutes  20 minutes sometimes  we had to take a break  it was horrible  we'd be yelled at  to go to break  the break you just heard  would take  three separate breaks  on regular radio  almost three separate breaks  maybe they'd prefer those days  1-877-CARS-FOR-KIDS  1-877-CARS-FOR-KIDS  how about that  how about we do that  you motherfuckers 
[01:35:30]  wherever I went yesterday  people were asking me  about this BCN thing  oh really  I couldn't get anything  done yesterday  cause wherever I fucking went  really  they needed my comment  on the BCN thing  yeah  yeah  people ask me about BCN  I guess it's true  so true  they are  did anybody say  that we kind of  broke that open  I think  I think we had  something to do with it  for real  I think we made it  so it forced them  to kind of say something  yeah  for real  they wanted to hold off 
[01:36:00]  for a little while  the website  there's no mention of it  for real  yeah  I guess in mid-August  it goes all sports  but it's going to go  to another frequency  and then  like another station  that does well  in the CBS chain up there  is moving to  where BCN is  so the BCN call letters  are done  that's so ridiculous  they're going like  online with it I guess  I mean  which is you know  those weird things  I love the  the bid I'm  I'm doing with the  wherever I go thing  but for real  the incompetence  of this fucking company  and they continue  to keep their jobs 
[01:36:30]  as they underperform  way more  than the people  they fire  and the radio stations  they turn into  something else  you can't get rid  of the BCN call letters  just ridiculous  they are  they're relegating it  to the internet  the BCN call letters  have been around  I think I read  last night  40 years  600 years  40 fucking years  and they're just  going goodbye  goodbye  and also  you know  in Philly  eventually  that's going to go  yeah yeah  of course  but they knew 
[01:37:00]  what they were doing  at the time  when they  whatever  it's old news  yeah that's going to go  JFK  gone  but these guys  continue keeping their jobs  as they underperform  it's fucking sickening  you can't keep your job  if you underperform  good luck  they fire everyone  around them  saying well  you're obviously  the problem  yeah  we heard those  didn't we hear rumors  for a while  or it was speculated  at least  that CBS  was eventually  going to sell  the radio division  so what they were doing  was just knocking  all the prices 
[01:37:30]  down  to make it look  profitable  so they could sell it  someone said that  and it didn't make sense  no one wants to buy  radio companies  right now  no  horrid investment  what's going to end up  happening  which is very interesting  you're going to have  a million owners again  like it was  about 10  15 years ago  really  like Zappus  communication  it's going to be  a million  I'm serious  it's going to be  a million owners  there's going to be  you know  one company  owning a few stations  here  not these huge  you know  conglomerates  like Clear Channel  and CBS 
[01:38:00]  they bought up everything  it's going back  the other way now  I'm telling you  you're going to see  just tons and tons  of owners  and they'll have to  lower the fucking  FCC  $350,000  for an utterance  you fucking idiots  yeah  and then it's  arbitrary  and they can  interpret things  and you can't say  F or A  get the fuck out of here  get the fuck out of here  by the way  CBS Radio owes me  $500 for consulting them  oh  when are you going to  finally bill them  huh  when are you going to  finally bill them  I bill people all the time

[01:40:00]  and the boys put a little  highlight reel together  so let's check this out  one more time  Opie and Anthony  starring Jim Norton  today  every day  sometimes the road to a  blissful relationship  can be bumpy  uh marriage  is  no one's saying  that you don't do a lot  of stuff  it's like  it's a business  it's a machine  one person's doing  the twittering  which is rich  and the other person  is spelling all the words  it's comedy's most  dysfunctional married  couple  Voss and Bonnie  if passion 
[01:40:30]  is like a roaring fire  then Voss  is peeing  all over it  is he an affectionate  guy  he  no  is he bad  with like  loving touching  well because  sometimes he touches  you but it's like  a toddler  or a monster  that doesn't  like hasn't  hasn't figured out  how to caress  and why flatter  the one you love  and the mother  of your children  when you can  shatter her fragile ego  right Rich  sometimes he  calls my ass  Margaret Cho's face  so if you think 
[01:41:00]  your relationship  is doomed  look at Voss  and Bonnie  and rest a little  easier knowing  it could be  a lot worse  I remember now  what a dick he is  one time I was  blowing him  quite well by the way  and he farted  that's the best thing  I've ever heard  that's the best thing  I've ever heard  that's the best thing  you win it 
[01:41:30]  Shirley Jones  hot when she was younger  we just debated that  for the last 15 minutes  and then Danny  found a picture  that proved your point  the early 20s version  of Shirley Jones  because I was watching  my biography yesterday  and Shirley Jones  was on there  that's weird  she was fucking hot  stupid Mrs. Partridge  I don't understand you  why  I mean I like biography  but if it's a Shirley Jones biography 
[01:42:00]  there's no way  I'm even fucking  I didn't watch it  waiting around  you know what  I didn't watch it  because I wanted to watch it  but you watch  like just weird stuff  all the time  it was on  when I woke up  from my nappy  and I opened my eyes  and I was like  who the fuck  is this hottie  and it turned out  to be stupid Shirley Jones  I forgot that you  sat with the TV on  yeah I had to  but that was hot back then  it's so weird  what was hot back then  she had a little head though  look at how small her head is 
[01:42:30]  compared to the rest of her body  it's kind of a little  silly because her hair  is pulled back  or something  that's not a good picture  of her either  the best one  was the one you came up with  before of her  from that movie  where she played  a prostitute  and  she looked good  Partridge family  yeah  yeah she was a prostitute  she prostituted herself out  that was the original movie  look at that shit  yeah she's alright  fucking dive right into that  it's that  vag ball  is that or a ball bag  there's something going on  either way  it's hot  yeah something's up there 
[01:43:00]  Shirley you can't be serious  I am  and I have a cock  we're supposed to talk  to Ian Halperin today  I'm not sure  if we're going to get him though  nine  because of things  things going on  things  look at him legs  but Ian Halperin  Jimmy's got great legs  me?  no I'm talking about  that's a nice leg picture  very good legs  very good legs  one boy most likely  to win an award  thanks to his legs  in high school  no 
[01:43:30]  it's a long name  for an award  it sure is  they couldn't even fit it  they had to keep going  in circles  around the base of the award  boo  boo  boo  fair enough  so Halperin's got this book out  that everyone is talking about  about Michael Jackson  basically saying  he was gay  and he didn't touch kids  right  he just liked  he liked the cock  is what he's saying  that sounded like  there was a little  bartering going on  yeah  alright look  we're going to go with  the gay  but we're not going to go 
[01:44:00]  with the kid thing  yeah  we'll help you out  we'll help you out  a little bit family  I need to make some money  a lot of people  are going to read my book  I'll say look  he didn't touch kids  but we got to go  with the gay thing  you all know it's true  we got to go  with something here  got to go with it  and they signed up  for gay probably so fast  like he goes  I'm going to go  with the gay thing  okay sold  good good  but he wears dresses too  he didn't fuck kids  alright we'll take it  I'll give you  I'll give you gay  and dresses  but no kid fuckers 
[01:44:30]  sold  Booch in Philly  wants to know  how I know  Ann sleeps with the TV on  well that's because  we take naps together  yeah yeah  we nap together  all the time  and bumble lick each other  hmm  Jesus  it's like  we do a radio show  you idiot  how long have you been  listening to this show  I've been  I've been lambasted  for falling asleep  with the TV on  by the way  TV on in my house  right now  that's bad  sometimes I run out  of the house  and just leave the TV on  yeah  I don't know why  I think because I think 
[01:45:00]  you know  hey there's voices upstairs  because the TV's your family  let's be honest  it's your family  and your friends  yesterday  yeah yesterday  was a complete  alone day  at the compound  I um  creepy right  I haven't reached out  to my good friend Danny  who blew me off  um  I was like  hey  hey  hey mate  and then I used a  bad  racial epithet  uh  I said  what are you doing  I go  brand new  Guinness 
[01:45:30]  keg  just tapped  freshly tapped  and he's like  oh dude  I'm doing this  it just  what were you doing  while my chick  wanted to make dinner  yeah  aww  tell her to make dinner  you're going drinking  and when you get home  dinner's ready  so men are gonna do  some drinking  that's right  and uh  so there I was  just kind of sitting  in the uh  back uh  back  I lit  I lit all my  tiki torches  and I just sat  at my back table  with a Guinness  and um  and the uh  Sonos music playing  and just kind of song 
[01:46:00]  all by myself  everybody hurts  that was it  we should do the  Anthony soundtrack  songs of your life  you know what  I gotta tell you something  what happened  it's kind of refreshing  it was nice right  no it wasn't  it was very lonely  it was very lonely  of course it's just you  I get lonely  struck down in terrified  loneliness  just you in the bottle  I get lonely  so I drank my beers 
[01:46:30]  and I just stood there  while Danny's at home  flipping the table  you called those carrots  did you eat them  sometimes I'll walk up  to the edge of the pool  with my hands in my pockets  and then just look at the water  and then  and then kind of  go up on my  tiptoes a little  and back down  and then up  and down  and look  and turn away  and go  I don't know what to do  I'm bored  put on a Motley Crue song maybe  yeah  and then 
[01:47:00]  and then I  went to the big  outdoor picnic table  yeah  which has seats  for probably 10 people  and I put  one cushion  on one of the seats  and I sat down  in the one cushion  how pathetic  I  I put on some music  and then I kicked  my feet up  on one of the  many many empty chairs  and just  laid my head back  and looked at the  airplanes flying above  hey  there's a  Aer Lingus 747 
[01:47:30]  on its way  to JFK  wonder what's  going on in there  wonder what friends  they're going to be  meeting  when they finally land  then I'd look around  at the  vegetation  all of the  the landscaped  vegetation  blowing in the breeze  and then I realized  I was sitting there  completely  yeah  thinking of topics  to talk to friends about 
[01:48:00]  yeah  yeah  and I was like  well  I have like a  half a glass of Guinness  left but  I'll go downstairs  anyway and top it off  nice  maybe I could think of  something once I'm  downstairs  but you know  something  I didn't  so I go back  upstairs  back outside  and  back to the table  did you jump in the  pool by yourself  yeah  yeah  I actually went in the  jacuzzi for a little  while but I was by  myself  so you know 
[01:48:30]  you put the bubbles on  and it's not so much fun  it's not the same  you're alone  I'm just sitting there  I lean back  and I'm like  ah this is nice  it'd be nice to share  it with somebody  but you know what  there was no one there  why  because I just sat there  I had nobody over the house  there was no one to call  really  oh why didn't you call  everybody was gone  huh  why didn't you call  Ant back when he called  to see if you wanted  to come over  Danny  my buddy Danny  you heard him  his buddy Danny  not his buddy  he was with his girl 
[01:49:00]  and that's cool  but  I thought about it  it was kind of late though  and I was like  well  I'm glad you thought about it  because I was sitting there  I was totally  completely  so you wanted listeners  to knock on your door again  you know  all of a sudden  it didn't seem that bad  a prospect  just somebody  stopping by  for a beer  for a brewski  do you think the listeners  realize that we're  very lonely people  when we're not doing  this radio show  so lonely 
[01:49:30]  it's a very lonely existence  it's so much fun here  and then we go out  on the street  it's like  well no wood  and then I  everyone I know  they have real jobs  I can't call anyone up  to go  hey you want to do something  and then the stuff  I want to do  is stuff like  13 year old boys  want to do  so  you know  bike and jerk off  have sex with 13 year old girls  wow  and then I realized  like  as I'm driving home  when I pick my truck up  from the garage  I'm in such a rush 
[01:50:00]  like oh damn it  I missed that light  I got to miss that  I'm on the expressway  I drive home so fast  and then I wonder  what am I rushing to?  why am I rushing home?  because I get there  and there's nobody there  I open the door  I unlock the door  I go inside  the lights are still on  from when I left in the morning  the TV  I hear it upstairs  I hear like the  the biography channels  on upstairs  just like I left it  do you run upstairs  ooh who's upstairs 
[01:50:30]  watching TV?  I go hello  I actually sometimes go hello  like someone might be there  yeah  but  no one's there  I'm all  I'm  I'm completely and totally  yeah  did you have friends there?  Jimmy  nobody 
[01:51:00]  come on  who'd you watch TV with?  I  myself  I sat there  all by myself  all by myself  and you know something?  did I want to be?  no  don't want to be  really?  you said you wanted to be  I thought I did  but it's  it's kind of  it's kind of lonely  why don't you call your friends?  you have two friends right here 
[01:51:30]  you didn't call  two co-workers  you guys are in Manhattan  so what?  we're in the sort of friend category  no you guys are in Manhattan  what are we  under necessary evil?  it's far  it's far trip  we suck  like  and it's traffic  like  I'm gonna call  that's true  I would've went for a dip in the pool  yeah  I love a good dip  dip in the pool  I'm good for a dip in the pool  bring the girls over  and get the jacuzzi  order Anthony around  yeah  see  that would be fun  I wouldn't mind  what time did you call Danny? 
[01:52:00]  glad to make up an excuse  that his girl was cooking dinner  I know  he wanted to be away from you  so badly  what time was it?  about 5.30?  yeah but I was napping  until about 6.30  yeah  guys what the fuck?  I go to bed at 6.30  do you really?  no  I literally at 1 o'clock  am going to bed  I was tired at 8 o'clock  last night  so late  oh  yeah I understand this song  so well now  really?  yeah  everybody at some point  in their life  fucking whiny emo shit  dude  R.E.M.  exactly 
[01:52:30]  S-E-C-K-S  yeah  sometime  it's the end of the world  as we know it  and I feel fine  good song  but  alright  yeah  this is fine  what about  I'm sorry  just whiny  how whiny  douche this guy is  you make me cry  you don't like the sorry song  I don't mind it  but it's just  what is it called  South Central Rain  just the fact that  Rolling Stone  like loves these guys  like that type of  you know  music critics  think these guys  are really brilliant  and thinking  fucking shit  no they did  you know  it was the sound  for the time 
[01:53:00]  you know  yeah  fucking  you wouldn't think  you could like  break up with a chick  and listen to this song  and feel all  emotional  I'd rather listen to  fucking Into the Void  as I'm driving home  just thinking about her  being beheaded accidentally  and then here  here's what went through  my head  here's me  sitting there  my head  I had to realize  I couldn't feel sorry  for myself  everybody hurts  I couldn't 
[01:53:30]  there were none over there  I got an uplifting song  for you  that you need  okay  let's go  Thompson Twins  yeah  Hold Me Now  oh  you want to think  of this song  the next time  you go on a tirade  on the air  maybe you're hurting  someone's feelings  you make a point  the next time  some poor fat lady  truck driver  the next time  you do an hour  four and twenty minutes  on her obesity  this song's for you

[02:08:30]  because like one  couldn't be more poppy  and the other one's like a drug fucking rock song  yeah  can you give me a little  mama told me  is it three dog night first of all  is it  I don't know  no credit again  that's when you're  fucking mom  mama told me not to come  this is three dog night too  how weird is this  mama told me  after I came quick  that I was a chip off the old block  this is the same fucking band 
[02:09:00]  what's all these crazy questions  you're asking me  yeah hear me  we just got the best depressing song ever 
[02:09:30]  wow  Johnny Cash doing Hurt  there's not a more depressing song than that fucking song  that is depressing  although I love Jim Norton's version of that  can we play Jim Norton's version of that real fast  enough of this  no one gives a shit about this song  I understand  this is a good one  Johnny Cash's video for Hurt is amazing  that's my favorite video  he went  he went to an old Johnny Cash museum right  that was just  you know  wasn't kept up or nothing  they closed doors years ago  and he walked through that fucking thing 
[02:10:00]  for the video  oh my god  does that kill you  I like to think  the pendulum is going to swing back the other way  I'd rather hear pendulum  out of my way  out of my way  you want to hear a tragic story  about  Johnny Cash's Hurt  yes  I'm such a dick  but I don't mean to be a dick 
[02:10:30]  my uncle died tragically  he was my favorite uncle  loved the guy  and my sister came out from Florida  for the wake and the funeral and all right  and as a distraction  I'm watching I guess MTV or whatever  and  and  Johnny Cash's version of Hurt came on  yeah  and I was like  really into that  when it came out  so I try to turn my sister  who is a little  oh no  who is a little  a little emotional  you know how I lack emotion  yeah  my sister has  all of my emotions  oh no  and then some  oh this has to be bad 
[02:11:00]  yeah  and she doesn't come from  my world  whatsoever  she's a mother  two kids in Florida  a relatively boring existence  yeah  and she walks in  as I'm  I'm  watching Johnny Cash  Hurt  and she's like  what are you watching  I'm like  oh you gotta see this  this is amazing  I want to turn you on to something  and she's all excited  like oh  this is a distraction  from what we're going for  oh no  dude within 30 seconds  she is bawling  and runs out of the room  screaming crying  what happened  screaming crying  just stupid me 
[02:11:30]  not realizing  good one  that you know  she's not going to take it  the same way I did  maybe emotionally  yeah  you can't really  handle that song  wow  it was just brutal  oof  I never forgot that  oh good  here's Johnny Cash  Hurt  a little piece  can we get a taste  of Johnny Cash  doing Hurt  this song is  deeply depressing  oh we did this break  right here  yes  here he goes  hello  the video is so good  he's just sitting in the house  picture of his mother  on the wall  his wife is just 
[02:12:00]  on the steps  everyone he knows  is dead  oh god  I hurt myself today  I hurt myself  today  did ya  to see if I still feel  well do ya  I focus  on the pain  did ya  the only thing  that's real  is it  the needle  tears the hole 
[02:12:30]  does it  the old  familiar  sting  is it  try to kill it  all away  do ya  but I remember  everything  do ya  what have I  become  my sweetest  friend  everyone 
[02:13:00]  I know  goes away  in the air  show a young person  of Johnny Cash  Jesus  alright  we get it  yeah  fade this out  yeah  could I  such a good video  fucking  too  they  the video  is so good  because they are  intersplicing  everyone's seen  the video by now  with the brilliantly  intersplicing  photos of him  he was young  oh my god  the clips they  picked are so 
[02:13:30]  and they have  that one  you get the  hell away  from me  that one  piece of audio  from him  it's really  a sad video  it's fucking  amazing  and this didn't  win video of the  year right  they gave it  other awards  but they didn't  give it the  big award  like what the  fuck  MTV  stupid MTV  and I believe  they gave it  this could be  the greatest  video ever made  for a song  seriously  I can't even  think of any  others that  would be in  the same  category as this  song  maybe  oh Mickey  you're so  fine  but aside from  that  I think that  Justin Timberlake  and I could be  remembering this 
[02:14:00]  incorrectly  won that year  for best award  and I think he  said that  the award  should have  went to  Johnny Cash  he said  this is ridiculous  I don't need  this award  but he took  it home  Johnny Cash  was on  like  fucking  what  a breathing  machine  at that  point  and they  weren't sure  if he was  going to  make it  to the  awards  and just  give them  the fucking  award  MTV  that was a  really  that was  showing  MTV  to me  that was  really  an irrelevant  thing  because they're  fake awards  they spread it  out  okay we'll give  a couple hip hop  artists some  awards  a couple  yeah  they can't 
[02:14:30]  concentrate on  just giving  the best award  out  they gotta  make it  you know  bounce  gotta be  fair  to bring  in all  the audience  shut it  so stupid  such a good  fucking video  do you  reading that  up on it  Dan  I heard  I don't know  if it's  one of those  urban legends  but I heard  when Trent  Reznor  heard this  version  for the first  time  he actually  told his  guys  turn off  the tape  and then  they just  like  left the  studio  they were  in the  middle  of recording  or something  and they 
[02:15:00]  all needed  to just  especially  Trent  just  needed  to walk  and just  like  be by  himself  he said  he was  blown away  by this  version  it's better  than theirs  it's much  better than  Nine Inch Nails  version  well the Nine Inch  Nails version  is solid too  but I mean  Johnny Cash  just made it  beyond special  any song he did  he did a version  of  Jimmy turned me on  to Johnny Cash  I knew the basics  but when  we did this  break already too  he did a version  of Cats in the  Cradle  by Harry Chapin  which is a  massively depressing  song  but Cash  removed the 
[02:15:30]  depressing aspect  of it  it was amazing  how he made  it not  depressing  he totally  changed the  tone of it  it was fucking  amazing  I mean Chapin's  version is better  but still great  he's dead  I like a good  cover  yeah  yeah  if it's done  right  I've bored  many people  at parties  with that  statement  you know  there's nothing  interesting coming  I like a good  cover  where are you  going  yeah exactly  I want to  describe some  of the covers  that I liked  and tell you  why I liked  which version  better 
[02:16:00]  get back  here ladies  oh  and  yeah  you should  someone is  suggesting  it went by  so I can't  give him credit  you call him  Corey Feldman  because you're  both herded  oh Corey Feldman  maybe could come  over the house  because you're  both herded  he could teach  me to moonwalk  he could bring  his hat  and his little  general jacket  and his fucking  high water pants  and his white socks  and stupid shoes  which were as  pristine as  Christopher Reeves  at the end  do we have 
[02:16:30]  an update  on Blanket  is Blanket  getting some  sunshine today  no  he's hiding  he's hiding  somewhere  where do you  think he's  hiding today  apparently the  mom was asked  do you want  the kids  and she said  hell no  hell no  because she  never wanted  to be a mother  she did that  for her best  friend Michael Jackson  surrogate  fucking fat  Debbie Rowe  surrogate  she is a beast  what a fucking  fatso she is 
[02:17:00]  Debbie Rowe  or  Wendy Williams  Debbie Rowe  no stop it  take the colored  thing  come on  I can't  I'm me  Debbie Rowe  is a fucking  come on  Wendy Williams  I would have to  so go  Wendy Williams  over Debbie Rowe  I don't know  Wendy Williams  is probably  a dirty  bang  she's probably  good in bed  she's probably  just a dirty  girl  she's a  freaking  beast  she's not  Debbie Rowe 
[02:17:30]  she's not  giant  Rusty Cage  was good  by Johnny Cash  Johnny Cash  also did a  U2 song  that was pretty  amazing  that didn't  get a lot  of play  Missy Elliott  won  in the club  Missy Elliott  won for  work it  over Johnny  Cash  hurt  maybe Justin  Timberlake  said at the  end that  should have  been Johnny  Cash's  award  Missy Elliott  over hurt  that's a  very  very smart  and relevant  move  and I'm sure  it was  exactly the  same as  every other 
[02:18:00]  Missy Elliott  video  the look  everything else  right  I don't know  what her videos  look like  they all look  the same  there's a lot  of push ins  and pull outs  and she's in  some wacky  clothes  and let's  see it  little shit  please  same shite  is that the  one where  she's  wearing a  fucking garbage  bag or something  you said that  already because  I was about  to go there  I'm not sure  okay  yeah because  she was into  the garbage  bag look  for a while  I'm sure  she had a  very fucking  good song  it's not a  very original  look as far 
[02:18:30]  as Missy Elliott  goes  they all look  the same  those videos  some of her  early shit  was  catchy  or whatever  and the videos  did have  kind of a  groundbreaking  look to them  but  after a while  was she using  like the  fisheye lens  or something  yeah some  weird lens  the color  was really  kind of  cool  too  they did  something  with  she's actually  a jewish girl  she looks black  yeah she looks  all right  we'll go to  break  we got the  michael jackson 
[02:19:00]  thing  we also have  ben mesrick  coming in  our good  friend ben  he's got  another book  he always has  great stories  great stories  story  this is right  we should play  a johnny cash  song  now that we  got three  i got his  u2 cover  you want that  do yeah  yes i do  which one  wandering  yeah he did  one  he also did  wandering  i want to  thank brian  not brian  kevin  from connecticut  wandering  was the one  i really liked  that didn't  get a lot  of play  you want to  hear johnny cash  doing wandering  which is probably  not the favorite  here  or u2's one

[02:26:00]  Johnny Rotten?  No, it's, uh...  Somebody help me.  Social distortion?  I don't know.  Social?  That version of the wall was missing a verse.  That was just a live version he probably did in a prison.  The one I wanted to hear, which we didn't have, was a studio version.  Why would you have the studio version, right?  I know, why would they? Johnny Cash.  Let's get Ben Mesrick in studio.  Another book.  Another book by this asshole. 
[02:26:30]  Hiya, Ben.  Hi, Ben.  You write about some interesting stuff, man.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, wow, look at that.  I have a little mutual admiration.  I think he's awesome.  Thank you.  You haven't read our book yet?  I've, I've, uh...  No.  No, not yet, but I have it.  Once we write it...  Do you have our book?  I think somebody sent me it.  Yes, you do.  You should read it.  It's a very good book.  Yeah, definitely.  Um...  A lot of good stuff in there.  God, Ben, we haven't talked to you in a while. 
[02:27:00]  The Accidental Billionaires.  The founding of Facebook,  A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal  is the name of this book.  Wow, that's a long title.  Who knew all this was going on?  There was a...  Well, it's more wanting to get sex  and getting money.  Ah!  Geeky kids at Harvard  who stumbled into the biggest company  they could imagine.  Isn't it always the way?  Yeah.  God.  Those geeks.  And we even said it years ago.  It's like, yeah,  they're the guys that'll inherit the earth.  And that's cool, guys.  Well... 
[02:27:30]  We'll just do radio.  Oh, wait a minute.  I should have been a geek.  What happened?  I was.  I had a friend last week who said,  you know, I'm trying to...  I can't get motivated to do...  He was an artist or something.  And I said,  that's because you get laid too easily.  There's a lot of motivation  when you're sitting in your room by yourself.  Distractions like pussy  kind of take away from creativity.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I can understand.  Is Mark Zuckerman married?  Zuckerberg.  He is not.  Did he say his name?  Mark Zuckerberg.  Oh, Zuckerberg.  I'm sorry.  Is he married? 
[02:28:00]  He's not.  He's had a girlfriend  throughout the whole process  of when he created Facebook,  you know,  from the very beginning.  And he's a very interesting guy.  Socially, he's not normal.  Sure.  He was a very awkward,  geeky kid  who's into his computer.  His computer is kind of his best friend.  And he, you know,  as he became  the youngest billionaire in the world,  his life changed pretty dramatically.  I mean, you know,  there's a scene in the book  where he goes home  with a Victoria's Secret model.  There's a scene  in the basement of a Harvard dorm  where him and his friend Eduardo 
[02:28:30]  who co-founded Facebook,  they're getting like groupie girls  because they became famous on campus.  But in general,  he's not one of these guys  who's out like partying or,  you know.  How does he go home  with the Victoria's Secret model  if he's had the same girlfriend  all throughout?  Well, I mean,  I think, you know,  yeah,  it's a good question.  I mean,  I don't know what he did  with the Victoria's Secret model.  Well, I just, you know,  know that he left the bar with her.  But he's had a girlfriend since college  and this is when he first was out  in Silicon Valley  and there was, you know,  a party  and there's this kid,  Sean Parker,  who's another character in the book 
[02:29:00]  who's like the bad boy  of Silicon Valley  who's also like this geeky kid.  Well.  But he was the kid  who co-founded Napster  with Sean Fanning  and didn't go to college  and basically was a dropout  who became incredibly wealthy  and brilliant  and he found Mark,  he found Facebook  and brought it to that next level.  And so him and Mark  were out there  and he started introducing Mark  to that world.  So do you think that like  Mark was probably,  if he banged,  let's just say the guy,  I don't know if he banged  the chick from the Victoria's Secret,  but if he did,  you know that kind of money,  you might as well  just tell your girlfriend,  like, yeah,  I'm banging some chick,  I'll call you in a little while. 
[02:29:30]  You're going to do leave?  Eight billion.  The bricks.  You know,  yeah,  he's a different kind of kid.  I mean,  he's one of those kids  that's just in the corner  and working on his computer.  And Sean Parker,  is that his name?  Sean Parker was the kid,  the bad boy of Silicon Valley.  Now,  Napster,  which kind of,  it did in a way,  the advent of it,  changed music  because they,  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Changed online music.  Is he still rich?  Well,  now he is  because he has a piece of Facebook.  He didn't get any money 
[02:30:00]  off of Napster.  Wow.  He didn't get any money  off of Plaxa,  which he founded after Napster  until later.  But he was the kid.  He was sitting  on a friend's laptop.  He saw Facebook  when it was just first coming out  and he thought,  this is the billion dollar idea.  So he went to New York,  met with Mark Zuckerberg  and the kid Eduardo  and brought them  and he's got a big piece of that.  Now,  Facebook started as a prank?  Yeah,  it was a college prank.  What do you mean by that?  Basically,  Mark Zuckerberg went on a date  that didn't go well  and he was home in his room  drinking beer.  Boy,  I bet you she regrets that.  Sorry to interrupt you.  I should have just sucked his dick. 
[02:30:30]  He was in his room  at late at night drinking beer  and he hacked into all  of the computer systems  at Harvard  and pulled up pictures  of every girl on campus  and he made a hot or not website  where you could vote  on who's the hottest girl.  And everyone logged on  at the same time  and it crashed  all the servers at Harvard.  So he nearly got kicked  out of school.  So a little while later,  he was sitting there  and he was thinking,  well,  what if girls could put  their own pictures up?  And that was kind of  the birth of Facebook.  That was what  the turning point was,  you know,  it was a hot or not clone 
[02:31:00]  that became,  you know,  the biggest social network  in the world.  And I don't even like Facebook.  It's all spam.  It's everyone inviting me  to their shitty events.  I don't want to be tickled  or nudged.  Oh, look,  you've been feather tickled,  have I?  I fucking hate it.  It is a lot of that.  Oh, it's annoying.  You want to go to a pillow party?  No, I certainly don't.  Send me a picture  of your clit.  There's still a lot of people  that enjoy the Facebook.  It's huge.  It's ridiculous.  I mean,  people in high school  and college  live on Facebook. 
[02:31:30]  Of course.  It's changing the world.  It's changed.  Facebook has changed the world.  It's the next evolution  in human history.  I mean,  it is.  MySpace,  then the Facebook.  Well,  MySpace is nothing like  MySpace.  No, I know.  Sure,  you're right.  But it started,  I mean,  everyone jumped on,  you know,  MySpace,  then went with Facebook,  and then Twitter's sort of,  you know,  an easier version.  Twitter's more like,  yeah.  But this Facebook  has changed the world.  I forgot who I was  talking to recently,  but kids being born right now,  their whole lives  are going to be on the internet.  100%.  Their whole fucking lives. 
[02:32:00]  You know,  we have to find  like an old shoebox  of pictures and go,  you know what,  I'm going to put a few  of these up there.  But now,  kids today,  their whole life  will be up there  for everyone to read.  And the other thing is,  kids don't think about privacy  the same way we do.  I mean,  you know,  all this like scandal  about people on Facebook  have you own your pictures.  Kids don't care.  They want to be,  everyone wants to be famous,  and Facebook is a way  to just throw yourself  out there.  So Facebook has become  this way,  you know,  it's gotten rid of privacy,  essentially.  And people like that.  What's the difference  do you think  between MySpace  and Facebook?  Well,  MySpace is a branding thing.  It's all about 
[02:32:30]  look at me,  look at me,  you throw your music  up there,  or you throw your,  but it's not a social network.  It's basically a website.  Right.  It's not like,  you don't live your life  on MySpace.  You might hunt for girls  on MySpace,  but you're not living  on MySpace.  People live on Facebook,  really?  People live,  I'm talking four,  five hours a day.  Where have you been,  Jimmy?  In college,  high school,  and also people  in their 20s,  you get on Facebook  when you get home  from work,  and you're on Facebook  until you go to bed.  The weird thing is,  I don't get to see  my family as much  because I live in the city,  and they've got  their own lives,  but then when we get  together for family events, 
[02:33:00]  and my girl,  she knows exactly  what's going on  with everybody else,  and they're like,  oh,  how did that thing go?  And I'm like,  how do you know  all this shit?  While we're communicating  with this Facebook.  You communicate,  you look at everyone's  pictures.  When you put your pictures up,  everyone knows that  your picture's up,  and so they see  your pictures.  So if you go to a party,  it's like everyone  on your Facebook friends  will all go to the party  with you because  they'll see it  as soon as you get home.  And they know  what you've been up to  before you get to the party.  Yeah.  It's not necessarily good.  It's not necessarily good.  I don't know if it's good 
[02:33:30]  or bad.  I just find it very strange.  I always like thinking  about how this will affect  things in the future,  you know,  because this is kind of  the beginning of it,  the beginning of social  networking,  networking and being able  to communicate instantly  with a shitload of people.  Yeah.  And what's that going to do  like 10 years down the road?  What do you think?  You know,  I think Facebook gets bigger  and bigger and bigger  and pretty soon the whole  world is on it  and you live in your house  but on Facebook.  So you don't have to  leave your house anymore.  Like that.  You can,  you know, 
[02:34:00]  there is that aspect of it.  I think it's great.  Listen,  I love Facebook.  I think it's really cool  but it's definitely,  it's going to change  all social relationships.  Like you will find  people to date  via friend networks  on Facebook  and you'll,  you know,  you'll live on it.  You will live  four or five hours a day  every day on Facebook.  Do you watch the news anymore?  I mean,  it's on Facebook.  You don't need to watch the news  because you can see it  right on,  you know,  someone else.  I've heard a couple  Twitter sites  because I'm a Twitter guy  more than Facebook  but it's basically  the same shit.  Right.  So I,  when I look at the local news  I'm like,  what?  I'm not going to find out 
[02:34:30]  it.  I read the newspaper.  Do you really?  No, you don't.  But I mean,  quick updates on,  the newspaper is what  happened yesterday  and, you know,  Twitter and Facebook  are what happened today.  So there's definitely,  it's like you village  to city to Facebook.  It's the next step,  I think.  I think it's a part of,  it is,  you said it's a piece  of human evolution.  It's like,  it's becoming  one collective  conscience,  consciousness,  if that makes sense.  Yeah.  Where everybody can  communicate with each other.  Now we can communicate 
[02:35:00]  silently through texting,  through emailing  and it's a part of  everybody kind of  connecting on one level  of consciousness.  eventually computers  or this is going  to be somehow  tied in with people  through evolution.  And Ben,  we say the listener  is going to puke  because we say it  all the time,  but at this point  we barely use our phones  to actually make  a phone call.  Oh yeah,  you don't have to  talk to anybody.  When it rings,  isn't it a weird feeling?  I don't have a ringer on,  I turn my ringer off.  Why are you calling me  when you can text me?  Nice app for the iPhone,  for Facebook.  Yeah.  And there,  you know,  there's my little Facebook.  Right.  You're right on there. 
[02:35:30]  And yeah,  you're just on there  on your,  you know,  phone.  Like you said,  it's not a phone call.  I would love it  if I didn't get  so many dumb e-vites  because it's harder  to block people.  Like,  that's all I want to do  is just be able  to block people  who send me forwards  or invites to shit.  Don't you understand  you're that guy too  when you put out gigs?  But the difference is,  no,  here's the difference.  You think you're good.  I don't email everybody  about it.  I just post it.  And plus my gigs  are entertaining  for everybody.  Of course they are.  Every single human being 
[02:36:00]  out there.  But you know what I mean?  It's like,  that's the only thing  I don't like about it.  And Jim's not filling out,  you know,  the which South Park character  are you guys.  God,  that shit.  What is the big thing  on Facebook there?  Quizzes.  I just,  every time I see one  I just block the quiz.  It's just like,  I don't care what letter  of the alphabet.  The thing is,  it is pretty easy  to just not do them.  Right.  Especially,  I've found the iPhone  is so much easier  with certain programs  than the actual program  on the computer.  Yeah, yeah.  Getting rid of shit  and going through 
[02:36:30]  your friend requests  and shit like that.  Yeah.  But what's crazy  is when Facebook  first started,  it was this exclusive site.  The goal was,  there are these  societies at Harvard,  they're kind of like  mixed between a fraternity  and a secret society.  And Mark and Eduardo  wanted to be in one.  Eduardo managed to get in,  but Mark didn't.  So they created Facebook.  At first,  you had to have a Harvard EDU.  You could only be  a Harvard kid.  Then they moved it  to Stanford.  They moved it  to a couple other schools.  And this exclusivity  actually is the reason  it grew so quickly  because everyone wanted  to get on it  because they couldn't. 
[02:37:00]  So they created  essentially their own fraternity  and that's what  it was originally.  Now it's open to everybody,  but it still has this feel  of being like,  you know,  controlled essentially,  which is why  it isn't becoming MySpace.  You feel safer  on Facebook  in a lot of ways.  It's your networks.  You have to,  you can accept people  to be your friend.  I think it jumped a step though.  So it's in Harvard  and then how does it get  to where it is today?  I know you said  they went to another college  They started at Harvard,  they moved to a few  Ivy League schools,  then they moved  to all colleges,  then they moved  to all high schools,  then they opened it up 
[02:37:30]  to older people.  And so it really  started with young,  you know,  one generation essentially.  But it happened  in a matter of months.  In a matter of months  it was at a million users  and then in another year  it was at 10  and then,  you know,  now it's 200 million.  200 million people  on Facebook?  200 million.  How many on MySpace?  It's down,  it's something like  100 and something million.  It used to be  MySpace was ahead.  Now Facebook is way ahead.  Here's my email  from Facebook.  July stand-up.  Don't forget to RSVP.  Delete.  This guy at the Hinge Cafe. 
[02:38:00]  Delete.  Oh my God.  That's the only problem  I have with it.  Aside from that,  I like it.  I just don't want to  stop emailing me shit.  Yeah,  but I mean,  with Facebook  you're supposed to only  have your friends  be your actual friends.  Right.  That's the general idea.  Yeah,  when you collect them all.  If you collect as many people  as you can,  then you don't know  these people.  Then there's trouble.  Yeah,  Jimmy,  it works better  on a much lower level.  Yeah,  if you have like 30 friends  and they're your actual friends.  You got fame,  so it makes it tougher,  but like...  Yes,  I do!  Just looking at my family,  they got,  you know, 
[02:38:30]  all of them got less than  100 friends.  Right,  you have your actual friends.  And it's very manageable.  That's true.  And they put up their pictures  and everyone can look  at their pictures  and every now and then  there's that one bad picture  that shouldn't be on there  and then they all say,  take that picture off  and it goes off.  Take it off.  The other thing to watch,  it's funny,  when a married friend  joins Facebook,  their status is,  it says single  and then when their wife joins  it changes to married.  Yeah,  people certainly do like  checking that out.  It's kind of funny.  Where does Facebook go though?  Well,  I think it just keeps getting, 
[02:39:00]  it's going to incorporate Twitter  in some way.  Has to.  They're obsessed with Twitter.  They started,  they changed their site  to look more like Twitter.  Right.  So it'll probably swallow  Twitter at some point  and I think it just keeps  getting bigger and bigger  and bigger.  I really think there's going  to be a billion users  in a year or two.  I think it's at the beginning  like you said.  I mean,  this is the start  not the end of Facebook  and Facebook just grows  and it becomes your whole life.  Right.  There's no reason to like,  if you want to go to a restaurant,  there's no reason to Google  that restaurant  because your group of friends,  someone probably knows  that restaurant  and it may,  sooner or later,  all of your, 
[02:39:30]  you know,  what you do in your life  is going to come from Facebook.  But let me ask you  about Facebook  because eventually  as technology gets better,  eventually typing to each other  is going to seem very archaic  and not communicating and real.  Like eventually  this social networking  will be,  everybody is on,  like pal talk screens in a way  and then it will be holograms  and then,  you know,  it's going to keep getting bigger.  Don't you think  social networking  will take fame away too?  I mean,  everybody can be famous  in their own little world.  I think that's the idea.  But then it's less important 
[02:40:00]  to actually look at famous people,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean,  you're trying to build  your own individual fame.  You're trying to, you want to be.  Well, every,  if you talk to high school kids  and college kids,  everybody wants to be famous  and so Facebook is a way  that in your group  you can be,  you know,  as famous as you want to be.  But yeah,  I think fame changes with,  certainly changes with Twitter  and things like that.  I mean,  the idea of a relationship  with your fans  is changing now.  Sure.  Your fans want a piece of you  all the time.  But, you know,  America is obsessed with fame.  I don't know how that  is ever going to end.  I mean,  that's, 
[02:40:30]  American royalty is fame.  So that will always be  a part of it.  But I don't know.  It's a wild story.  I mean,  I think how Facebook  got founded,  these kids,  it just kind of blew me away  because I knew nothing about it.  And as I dug into it,  it just,  it was really wild.  And they're now billionaires.  I mean,  yeah,  they're 25 years old  is the crazy thing.  Mark's not even,  you know,  he's still a kid  and he's the youngest  billionaire in the world.  And Sean Parker's  running around New York City  and he's worth,  you know,  God knows how much  and he's,  you know,  he's just like a rock star.  And it's a, 
[02:41:00]  from being,  you know,  geeky kids.  I admire it.  And, you know,  you sat in your room.  Who doesn't?  Yeah.  And then I was a geeky kid  in Harvard  in the same place as them,  but I didn't,  I wasn't smart enough  to come up with something  that made me a billionaire.  Dude,  these ideas were right there  for the taking too.  I mean,  the moment was there.  Oh, yeah.  They were right there.  Someone had to think of it.  Yeah.  But it was simple.  It wasn't something,  you know,  it really,  yeah,  it's great.  Hey,  I got to ask you about,  well,  I still call it  Bringing Down the House.  Yeah.  The movie?  21.  Did you like what they did 
[02:41:30]  to your book?  You know what?  Here's the thing.  I actually loved the movie  and I loved it  because I thought  It was a lot different  than your book there, Ben.  Very different.  Spacey was great.  Spacey's amazing.  I think Jim,  the main kid,  is great.  I enjoyed it.  It was a different movie.  It was like a Hollywood,  you know what?  They didn't make Rounders  and in a lot of ways,  I loved the movie Rounders  but I was kind of happy  because Rounders  was aimed at poker players.  They could have made a movie  aimed at blackjack players.  They went,  you know,  young and they went  and it was number one movie  for a couple weeks.  I'm not going to lie.  You know by now  that I was a huge fan  of Bringing Down the House. 
[02:42:00]  I loved the book.  I was confused by the movie  because it  It wasn't the book.  It went away from the book  so much that  I wasn't sure  if I liked the movie.  You know what?  It was flashy  and it was a different,  I thought it was sort of  a different project  in a lot of ways.  I mean,  it was really  different title,  different movie  but I had a great time with it.  You know,  I didn't have any power  obviously because I'm the author  and the author is like  the lowest,  below the caterer  on movie fans.  Thank you for your story.  Goodbye.  But I thought you,  I'm sure you're happy  that one of your books  was made to a movie  and it did well  and all that 
[02:42:30]  and you know  but as a creative person  is it frustrating  to watch your  That movie was not.  your original work  and they're kind of  making it different  You know what?  I'll say it's not.  Without you having a voice in that?  I don't live that way.  Like I write the book,  I hand it off  and I say this is your project  now turn it into  a fun movie  and I think Kevin's fantastic  and I think he did a great job  and they changed that character  and that was the big change  I think  because he plays  this fantastic bad guy  and that's his,  you know,  his niche in a lot of ways  and so I thought  it was awesome.  I really loved it.  I saw a screening of it 
[02:43:00]  and I was like  this is great  and I know why people  don't like it  and I love the movie  Rounders too  and I understand why that's  it's different though.  You know,  I think  I'm not saying I didn't like it  I was just confused  that it was  It was different.  It was so different  in my eyes.  I think if you made  Bringing Down the House  straight the way the book was  it would have been  a smaller film.  Really?  I think.  I think it would have been  more of like a  really intellectual  kind of smaller  about MIT geeks  who were like  you know  number theory  and all this  I think it would be  a different movie.  Okay.  But I mean  I understand why people  feel that way 
[02:43:30]  but on the whole  people liked it  so I  did very well.  It did great.  So this movie  we're making  Accident of Billionaires 2  it's the same studio  and it's Kevin Spacey  producing Scott Rudin  Wait, you're already  making this into a movie?  Yeah, so Aaron Sorkin  adapted it while I wrote  the book  which might be  the first time  that's happened.  He handed in the screenplay  and it's supposedly fantastic  and I've read  that David Fincher  is directing it  which is like a god  so and Spacey, Rudin,  Dana Bernetti  and Mike DeLuca  producing  and  Who's that is?  Mark Zuckerberg. 
[02:44:00]  You know I've seen  on the internet  I've seen them talking  about either Shia LaBeouf  or Michael Cera  but I don't know  what's real or not  as I said  the author is  the lowest person  on the level  so I don't know anything  but if Fincher's directing  and Sorkin wrote the script  they can get just about anybody  I think  I think Sarah would be awesome  I think Shia LaBeouf  would be a cool Sean Parker  but you know  who knows  it's going to be  anybody they want  Ben's doing well  Ben's worth a hundred bucks  huh?  Nobody wants to make  my fucking books  into movies  Alright, who plays  hooker number 304?  Have you been 
[02:44:30]  anywhere interesting lately?  You always come in here  with some good stories  of traveling  Yeah, I've been to  some crazy places  I mean  you know  this book just was  basically running around  like Silicon Valley  and Harvard  I was hanging out  at like  secret societies  at Harvard  I was like the old guy  in the corner  but in terms of  like my travels  Did you see anything  cool at Harvard  that you didn't expect?  Well, you know  there's one element  I write about  in the book  is called 
[02:45:00]  the fuck truck  which is  the finals clubs  at Harvard  Harvard is not  there's not a lot  of hot girls  it's not like  the coolest place  in the world  let's put it that way  It's a bus  that goes from  So there's a thing  called the fuck truck  which goes around  to all the girls  and it brings  the girls  to these parties  and so you'll go  to a Phoenix party  which is the club  in the book  and like the bus  shows up  with all the girls  from Wellesley  and this and that  and it's just  kind of a funny  We did a whole bit  Oh, did you do  a thing on the fuck truck?  Did you go on the fuck truck?  No  You guys should go  on the fuck truck 
[02:45:30]  No, it's legendary  when we were up in Boston  It's legendary  Yeah, it was mostly Wellesley  because Wellesley  is mostly a girls school  Yes, it's basically  Wellesley, Harvard, MIT  Right  And they bring all the girls  in from Wellesley  So they make it very easy  that girls get on the bus  for a good time  Yeah, I describe it  in the book  like you go on the bus  and it smells like  alcohol and cheap perfume  because it's like  it's the bus  and there's always  It goes to Wellesley  so sometimes the Harvard guys  go on the bus  and they have to come home  on the bus  and it's the saddest bus ride  in the world  It's a whole bunch  of geeky guys  who did not get laid  at Wellesley  on their way home 
[02:46:00]  on the fuck truck  But yeah, the fuck truck  is a big part of it  but yeah, there's other things  like there's one club  called the Persillion  which is like the ultra  where girls are only  allowed in twice  On your wedding day  your wife can take  a tour of the club  and on your 25th reunion  and other than that  girls are never allowed  in the club  Why would anyone  want to belong  to that club?  Well, the other rumor  about the club  is if you're a member  and you haven't made  a million dollars  by your 30th birthday  they give it to you  and I believe  that's a rumor  but it's one of these  like old world clubs  that goes back 300 years 
[02:46:30]  it's incredibly  The Persillion?  Yeah, the Persillion  it's like this secret building  and no one's ever allowed in  and they have like this stairway  that goes up  and supposedly all these mirrors  there's no windows  and it's like  the powerful people in the world  all were parts of the Persillion  and the two Winklevoss twins  the guys who claimed  Mark stole the idea from them  they were like  the Olympic rowers  identical twin Olympic rowers  they were members  of the Persillion  so part of the reason  Mark wanted to hang out  with them  was because they were like  you know  guys like that  and Mark was this  you know  geeky Jewish kid  in the corner  and so they believe 
[02:47:00]  he stole their idea  but I believe  he really just wanted  to hang out  with the cool kids  on campus  and you know  it wasn't  he didn't use  their idea at all  but that club  was pretty intense  like you walk around  and I had some inns  you know  it's part of  you know  what I do  is trying to get  into places like this  and it's like  wow this really exists  I mean this is like  a 300 year old thing  that like  yeah there are  a few of those things  like Roosevelt's  and Rockefeller's  and Skull and  yeah Skull and Bones  at Yale  you know  at Yale  with a lot of  well a few presidents  yeah that's what this is like 
[02:47:30]  I mean it's just like that  went back  goes back really far  do they paddle  each other's face  at these places  I don't know what's going on  in that department  but I mean  it's pretty intense  just the fact that  they've been able  to keep so much secrecy  for hundreds of years  so long  it's like  wow that is some loyalty  what the fuck  are they doing in there  what are they doing  I don't get anything  where you don't want  broads to hang out  and blow you  what's the use of  fucking blowing to a club  if you can't bring  some chicken  leave the club  and get blown  but because you're  a member of the club  everyone kind of  knows who you are  how do they know  you're a member of the club  you know what  it gets around 
[02:48:00]  when you  the punch process  for finals clubs  are really bizarre  where they like  something slipped  under your door  and you've been punched  and then you go  to a series of events  and like one of the events  is you have to bring a date  and they judge you  on how hot your date is  and the hotter your date is  the more likely you are  to get into the club  and girls know  about this punch party  so the hot girls  want to go  because it's a status thing  also  so it's a very strange  social world there  yeah  and then there are kids  like Mark  and essentially me  who were sitting in your room  like I was sitting there  writing  and he was sitting there  where he got his computer 
[02:48:30]  because we didn't really  have the other options  available to us  nothing being slid  under your door  exactly  nothing  nothing being slid  under my door  eviction notice  right  unusable condoms  invitation to the  Jewish fraternity  nothing really  so this Brazilian  who's the president of that  I don't know  who the president is now  I mean I know  that there was a Roosevelt  and there was a Rockefeller  and there was people like that  I forget which Roosevelt  one of the Roosevelt  didn't get in  it was either FDR I think  and he said  his greatest disappointment  in life was not 
[02:49:00]  becoming a member  or something like that  licorice legs  exactly  he couldn't get up  those steps  fucking pick him up  by the neck  and haul him through the window  I can relate to all this stuff  because I was part of a frat  oh yeah  and we used to have to  pick up marshmallows  with our bare asses  without using our hands  and then waddle across the floor  and you know  bomb the  that's a real heterosexual  kind of thing  for a bunch of guys  to be doing  and bomb the rival  fraternity house  that just happened to be  you know  across the room 
[02:49:30]  yeah  I mean  there were scenes like that  in the book too  in the Phoenix  the guys had to carry  a chicken around  for a week  and keep it alive  for a week  and that was their  like fraternity punch  and then  things like that  I mean  they're definitely  they're like fraternities  except they also  might give you a million dollars  when you're 30  so there's that extra step  what did you  major in?  around the world  I was like  social theory  I wanted to be a writer  so what I majored in  was more to appease  my parents  who wanted me  to go to law school  so I was like  social political theory  but I wrote my 
[02:50:00]  senior thesis  on rock and roll  and the development  of rock and roll  from like  Jim Morrison  to the new  kids on the block  how'd you do?  actually I did okay  but you know  I knew I wanted  to be a writer  like that's all  I wanted to do  so you know  whatever  major didn't really matter  this guy sucks  he can't write  worth their shit  yeah  I mean you know  what I write  is very different  than what I started  out writing  when I graduated  so I used to write  like pop thrillers  I used to write  for the X-Files  and then I wrote  a TV movie 
[02:50:30]  a book called Reaper  which became  Fatal Error  which starred  Antonio Sobato Jr  and it still airs  at like 2 in the morning  on FX  it's horrible  what X-Files  were you involved in?  I wrote the book  called Skin  which was a stand alone  book based on  it starred Mulder and Scully  and they were hunting down  a skin transplant  gone bad  and the skin transplant  led to this guy  murdering people  and it all took place  in Thailand  where I'd never been  so I used a Fyodor's guidebook  and I sat there  I wrote all these scenes  in Thailand  and I was like  I don't know  what the fuck I'm doing  and I wrote it in a week 
[02:51:00]  because it was like  a money deal  because I was a struggling writer  and then I'd get calls  for years  of people  you know  obsessed fans  would be like  where's Mulder now?  I'm like  I don't think he's real  yeah  let me get to  I'll write you something  yeah exactly  it was crazy  but yeah  I mean I wrote  you know  thrillers  and then I met  the MIT kids  and that kind of  changed my life  wow  damn man  very cool  in the shit  I mean I'm like  yeah  I'm kind of like  trying to be  Hunter S. Thompson  without the guns  and suicide  the light version 
[02:51:30]  yeah you don't want  to be blown out  of a cannon  oh no  I don't want to  with your ashes  you see that  documentary on him  I did yeah  holy shit  was that good  I know  he's a guy  he's amazing  he's amazing  fucking amazing  is right  yeah  well it looks like  you got another  hit on your hands  Ben  I hope so  it's been  and Facebook's  definitely terrified  of it  they called me  the Jackie Collins  of Silicon Valley  really  that was their response  exposing  a little too much  they're not thrilled  they're not thrilled  that I wrote this book  why  you know  Mark's a very private person  but also  they're you know  just got valued  at six and a half billion  and they're terrified  of what I might say 
[02:52:00]  and I'm a big proponent  they offer you money  to not write it  I was hoping they would  no  not for me  they didn't offer me  any money  they didn't go that route  they basically  they were very nervous  and they sent me  we were in contact  the whole time  but then when the book  came out  they were like  who got betrayed  because the subtitle  didn't like the subtitle  betrayed  who's betrayed  but I think Mark's a genius  I do think he shed  friends along the way  but I see it more like  Superbad the movie  where they were these  two good friends  and suddenly  you know  it fell apart  because they started  to get laid 
[02:52:30]  and get rich  yeah yeah  I read the book  I'm amazed  I did not know  that Facebook  was a front for kiddie porn  no I did not say that  it was just  it was right there  I don't think  that's in the book  no but I have heard  that poke  you know  you poke people  on Facebook  that originally  was about sex  that on the campus  you would poke  the person you wanted  to have sex with  and then you'd have a meeting  I don't know  if that's true or not  but that's the rumor  that I heard  that's how it started  well it doesn't work anymore  no matter who you're poking  you're doing a book signing  there Ben  I'm doing it in Boston 
[02:53:00]  I'm doing it on Thursday night  at the Brattle Theater  tomorrow  6pm  oh that's tomorrow  yeah  and then I'm doing something  in Baltimore next week  and I'm doing  I'm on the  you know  doing everything  I don't know what I'm doing  to be honest with you  but I'm in Baltimore  on Tuesday night  I'm doing Thursday night  in Boston  at the Brattle  cool man  I love Boston  so it's great  I'm googling my uncle  he was a Harvard Law graduate  many many years ago  he graduated  with a very high honor  so I'm trying to see  if he was a member  of that weird club  oh yeah  find out what club  he was in  I think he was in one  The Fly  he probably was in  The Fly was the other  like big kind of scary one 
[02:53:30]  where I have a friend  this is actually a bad story  but I have a friend  who is  they're going to come after me  I don't know  this kid who was joining  The Fly  and they had this big party  and he got ridiculously drunk  and fell down the stairs  and landed  and was lying near coma  and supposedly  they were all  standing around  trying to figure out  whether they should  go bury him out back  but no  they brought him  to the hospital  and everything was fine  but that's the story  I heard  the story I heard  was that it was like  we can't get in trouble  because we're The Fly  but he ended up  becoming a member 
[02:54:00]  of The Fly  and loved it  but The Fly  is like one of the  other intense ones  I went to one party there  and it was like  I felt so out of place  why  because everyone's  in tuxedos  and everyone's like wasps  and they go back  a hundred years at Harvard  and you know  the Phoenix was the one club  where a kid like Mark  could have gotten in  if he was more social  they allowed  different types of people in  The Parsillion  and The Fly  you know  were much more like  intense  Well the Parsillion  how do they have  Niedermeyer would have  gone there  and I mean  you know  Parsillion was like  you had to have been  at Harvard 300 years 
[02:54:30]  How do you have  fucking parties  with chicks there though?  Well who knows  what they really do upstairs  but there's a  one room at the bottom  called the Bicycle Room  and that's like  a pre-party place  where girls are allowed  it's not really attached  it's like on the outside  of the building  and then the members  can go upstairs  but the girls can't  The cool thing about  the Phoenix is  a member can bring  a girl upstairs  so the girls all come  in the parties  in the basement  and then if a guy  likes a girl  he can bring her upstairs  but guys can't go upstairs  if they're not members  so the guys  who are in the Phoenix  control the flow 
[02:55:00]  of women up and down  the stairs  So the weird thing is  I mean it's great to join  if you can get in  It sounds tiring  Exactly  It sounds tiring  It does  What else are you  going to do?  You're in college  You just want to  do some pussy diving  See but you forget  this is Harvard  where there is  the odds of getting  late are so incredibly  small  My first party at Harvard  I had a friend  who was visiting me  from Cornell  and we get to the party  and it's 200 people  jammed into a dorm room  and there was a keg  and no one knew  how to tap the keg  because none of us 
[02:55:30]  had ever gotten drunk  in high school  we didn't know  what to do  and my friend from Cornell  was like  are you guys serious  and had to go  and tap the keg  Wow  So that's a regular  Harvard party  What the hell is this?  I don't even know  what this is  Well because we were  all the kids  who never were  invited to any parties  so we get to Harvard  and we throw our own parties  but you know  I don't even know  how to get a keg  I mean how does that  even happen?  Yeah how do you even  get one?  Where does it come from?  Does it come from  you walk into the store  and say how do I get a keg?  Oh shit that is geeky  It was really bad  I fully admit  it was really bad  Well like we were 
[02:56:00]  saying before  look who made the money  and Facebook  and things like that  Yeah  The geeks that weren't  really partying  Sure  God damn it  Alright  The book is called  The Accidental Billionaires  The Founding of Facebook  A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius  and Betrayal  Betrayal  by Ben Mesrick  Signing tomorrow  at the Harvard Bookstore  in Boston  Yeah  Thank you so much  Thank you Ben  No problem man  We're going to take a break  and continue  Opie and Anthony  Check it out  Opie and Anthony  Did a lot today so far 
[02:56:30]  Opie and Anthony  During the breaks  we're listening to a  segment  out of Boston  talking about BCN  going away  Yes  Our old boss up there  and our old friend  Oedipus  on TV  Oedipus  what did you call it?  Oedipus  Oedipus 
[02:57:00]  Oedipus  I don't know  she really butchered  his name  and he looks  really pissed off  It was his baby BCN  He worked there  for over 30 years  I believe  He built it  He built it  and now  it doesn't even exist  It doesn't exist  It's unbelievable  It exists on the internet  I think is what  it's going to be  Internet only  Yeah it'll do  one of the  What do they do though?  That HD crap  How does that work?  Like other jocks?  HD crap?  No  HD crap 
[02:57:30]  It's a bunch of  production  It sounds like  it's BCN  but it's  a bunch of music  with production  He was very right too  with what he was saying  about how the suits  programmed  and he was just  100%  He hit it right  on the head man  and that's a guy  that knows radio  Well the problem  God why do we talk  about regular radio  so much  Because we were  in it for forever  But the problem is  And we watched it  go right down  the shitter  The radio companies  got really lazy  and stopped  hiring creative people 
[02:58:00]  and people that  really knew how  to run a radio station  Hired money people  Yeah so they had  no choice  They then said  well okay  we could hire  a consultant  and he'll tell us  what's going on  So it became  this consultant  told you what to do  because he was  telling another station  to do this in Atlanta  and wherever  Dallas  blah blah blah  So then that's why  you fast forward  a few years  and you get  radio sounding  exactly the same  in every fucking city  It wasn't like that  when I got into it  It was cool  Yeah 
[02:58:30]  You didn't know  what the station  was doing  in any particular city  That's what made it fun  You tune in a new station  and go wow  they're really crazy  down here  Yeah there's nothing  like that going on  Nothing  Because they just  couldn't find  the creative people anymore  or were just too lazy  to search them out  So then they went  with focus groups  and consultants  which is the death  of anything  We call them  of anything  We call them  the insultant  Because their whole job  is to find  something wrong  If everything's right  and working good  then they will go 
[02:59:00]  we don't need you  We don't need you  So they insult you  So they can come  into a situation  where the station  is perfect  It's doing everything  correct  But if the consultant  walks down the hall  to the GM  and says  well I've been  hanging out for two days  listening and talking  to everybody  and guess what  this station's perfect  you know  you don't need me  Who's going to say that  Goodbye  No money  Because then the GM  goes okay  thank you  You're fired  Something wrong  Right  So they go  well this show  needs to be  a little fine tuned  Just the whole logic 
[02:59:30]  of a consultant  doesn't make sense  You need to tweet this  You need to do that  Really  Right  Alright  So Ian Halperin  will not be on our show today  We tried  and tried  It might happen tomorrow though  It might  Yeah  He didn't tell you  Yeah  Okay  He said you want it tomorrow  I'm like yeah of course  It might happen tomorrow  Yes it depends  If tomorrow becomes today  But we might have him tomorrow  Yes  If Scarlett Johansson cancels  Stop  I love when Steve comes in  and does guest pitches  and like he'll ask for 
[03:00:00]  like something we have to ask  I understand he doesn't know  but  then he'll be like  Al Pacino  No  Tell him we don't want him  Yeah like that needs to be pitched to us  Barack Obama  Do you want  Osama Bin Laden  No  We don't want him  We don't have time  He's not doing a lot of press  Yeah  We don't  No we have duty jokes to get to  Sorry we can't do that interview  Matthew McConaughey  I mean then all of a sudden  someone will show up  that we weren't sure 
[03:00:30]  if we said yes to  Yeah that happens a lot  It's like who are you  Like who's coming in today  He's like yeah  Is an author of a book  about lug nuts  It's like  Did we ever say yes  No you did  It's like we would never say yes  to an author about books  a book about lug nuts  But just so Ben  if you're listening  this is not really directed at you at all  actually  No we had a good interview  But just so Ben knows  we like him  No no I was just saying  I just saw nuts  and booked it myself  Yes  Can I know how delicious they are  Yes 
[03:01:00]  I gotta tell you  I filmed the guest pitch meeting yesterday  pretty much as a goof  Oh yeah yeah  And then I threw it up there  and what the fuck  people really loved it  Just us  you know  like Steve  just the pitching guests  and us giving our comments  Yeah  There was some hilarity in there  It got the achy breaky heart  that they came up with  Does this achy breaky your heart?  If you want to check it out  I got a YouTube channel  OP Radio  but I threw it up there  like ah  maybe a couple hundred people  will find this interesting 
[03:01:30]  and they're like  no one of the best videos  you've posted so far  I'm like what?  Yeah because you know why  it was honestly just video  no one was sitting there  playing to a camera  it was just  that's what happens  at a pitch meeting  after the show  that's exactly  what it's like  without any added shit  and people are shocked  at how we really feel  about certain individuals  Oh I know  they're like  Jesus Christ  I thought you guys were friends  I think that's cool though  that we left that in  it's like you know  hey some people  we fucking just  you know  we don't want them  on the show right now 
[03:02:00]  or whatever  so we go  no fuck it  I'm going to make that  a series  because the honesty  is so great  I know it's brutal  so great  and I had to cut down  the video  maybe I'll make a part too  because the Slick  what's his name  the fucking  Slick Rick  yeah that part  didn't make it  and a few others  because I just  how long was the video  it still was over 4  which is like  an eternity  on the internet  very watchable though  it's funny  yeah  absolutely  people were wondering 
[03:02:30]  why you were under  the console  and Sam was smiling  all these little things  they picked up on  because I unplugged  my computer  which is plugged in  under the console  so I crawl under  the console  Sam's smiling  and I just come up  inside stuff  but you know  that was funny  yeah so  check it out for yourself  if you want  is that the guy  that was  die  yes  by the way 
[03:03:00]  to let you inside  the show a little more  when all of a sudden  you hear us just  talking to imaginary people  we're really talking  to people  that are walking  down this long hallway  yeah  sometimes we'll comment  on a girl's fine rack  or we'll tell someone  that he should die  because of what he did  to us 10 years ago  the gauntlet  right  the gauntlet of  of people that walk  past our studio  I'm googling my family  like people I  I haven't like  my cousin wrote a book  on like  Indian prostitution  she's like a 
[03:03:30]  religions major  no  she's like a  religions major  she knows all that  religion  and she wrote  like a book  about Indian prostitution  like what a disgrace  I am  really  well no you're not  no I mean I'm not  but I mean  I haven't talked  to him in many  many years  he's a selling author  yeah Jimmy  but it's like  I must just be  the laughing stock  let it be known too  I'm being reminded  that Jimmy's line  about Seth Green  killed too  what was that  I don't want to say it  why  make him go to  my fucking  YouTube channel  they'll go anyway  to hear me say it  well Danny  sets you up nice 
[03:04:00]  Danny  what did you ask about  we weren't sure  if we should have  Seth Green  on the show again  and I think  we're going to end up  having  die  die  give us our TV back  give us our TV  should we call it in  let's call it and ask him  for our TV  no  why not  where's our TV  maybe he wants to come in  and take a walk  that memory lane  hey  give us our TV  you don't need it  I hope he can hear that  I think he can 
[03:04:30]  so I think  we'll probably end up  having Seth Green  on but Danny  what did you say  about Seth Green  during this video  yesterday  that what  like what he might  be plugging  no no  you were setting up  Jimmy's fantastic line  but I don't know  exactly what you said  I don't remember it either  still is  you're right  you're right  you want me to ask  for a performance  oh no  yeah ask for a performance  cracker's broken  we gotta get to the sets  clean  Jimmy just leaned over  stupid Sam's eating crackers 
[03:05:00]  and Jimmy just leaned over  and smashed his crackers  with his fist  it wasn't even a smash  he just reached over  very softly  and gently  and just slowly  crushed his crackers  the best part of this  part of the video  is Ant trying to sneak out  oh yeah  you're trying to sneak out  as Steve was still  pitching gas  I got my backpack  and then I'm  kind of slipping out  it's hard to get past  Steve though  literally  slipped out  yeah  Seth Green 
[03:05:30]  oh here we go  he was just the host  of Monday Night Raw  he was pitched  and it was an eh  last time  so I don't know  he wrestled in the main event  cool  I think that new season  of Robot Chicken  of Robot Chicken  yeah that's  I mean look  it's a pretty popular  new season of Robot Chicken  I'm not a fan of Seth Green  but I mean  if he's going to be in  for 25 minutes  Bill he'd talk about  without a paddle  yes 
[03:06:00]  I want to just talk about  without a paddle  and see him get all upset  and tell us how much money  he made a lot of money  he's tanking partners  with Triple H  shut up  who gives a shit  about your dumb wrestling  Sam  that sounds to me like  a I don't give a shit  I like him  that wasn't a no  well wait  is that  before I move on  is Seth Green a no  or is it a yes  no I could care less  I'd say no  do we have anything  like when is he being  pitched for  soon  soon like August 
[03:06:30]  like early August  they started pitching him  two months ago  maybe we can figure out  a way for him to be in  while something else  is happening  so that way it's not  just  yes like vacation  that was brilliant  there it is  just like vacation  there it is  just kidding  that's good  that rules  alright  so we might get  Ian Halper in  tomorrow  he was on Fox News  last night  talking about this  MJ book he wrote  and wow  wow 
[03:07:00]  wow  it was a secret  everybody knew  I mean  pretty much  a lot of people  knew Hollywood  why in this day  in 2009  why didn't it  come out sooner  and you know  well that's the  question  unfortunately  there's a lot  of homophobia  that still pervades  Hollywood  the music industry  in fact the rap  industry  there was a great  book last year  written by Teren Steen  called Hiding in  Hip Hop  about all these  gay rap artists  who hide in the  closet  there's obviously  a sociological  reason for that  and I think 
[03:07:30]  it boils down  to racism  even though  we're in 2009  we have an  African American  president  we still have  a long way to go  in a lot of racial  filth  George Michael  was convicted  you have Elton John  Boy George  nobody holds it  against them  but because  of the color  of his skin  Michael Jackson  coming out  major red flags  for him  this guy's a  fucking dummy  shut the fuck up  Christ I'm so  sick of this shit  they fucking  came out in droves 
[03:08:00]  to support him  you fucking  out of touch  idiot  stop  because of the  color of his skin  shut the fuck up  the color of his skin  was whiter than white  God do we hate  this guy already  Elton John  came out  people love Elton John  distracted everybody  with a fucking  muskrat on his head  when he came out  that's what did it  oh by the way  I suck cock  what the hell's  on his head  no one heard him  no one heard him  say I like ass sex  instead of looking  at that fucking  thing on his head  god damn 
[03:08:30]  did you really  give a shit  when Elton  you found out Elton John  was gay  who cares  who gives a shit  there's nothing  like  I love the people  that think we're  still living in like  the 50s  I know  and then he  turns homophobia  into racism  for some  I don't know  how he did that  stop it already  enough  yeah we have a  president but  there's a long way  to go  what  czar of the world  Jesus Christ 
[03:09:00]  enough right  really  really  I mean  a few short  years ago  there was some  serious  racism  and persecution  going on  and now we're  looking at the  president of the  United States  being a black guy  just stop it  already  everybody  it's always  there's a lot  further we gotta go  fucking smile  and go  Jesus Christ  look how far  we've come  now we try to get  this guy on the  show  Howard had him  today  did Howard attack  him  I hope  I hope  he did  fucking softballed 
[03:09:30]  it  why  who the fuck  knows  here goes my  soup container  I'd make a great  basketball player  I cannot sink  a piece of garbage  into that garbage  pail  alright let's see  what else he had  to say  Halperin  is that how you  say his name  or Halperin  I don't know  says MJ's voice  and dance moves  were not what  they used to be  no shit  his voice and dance  moves weren't there  anymore  I think maybe  he wanted to die  rather than  embarrassing himself  on stage  this is from  one of the  members of the  household staff  who talked to  you about that  but yet on the 
[03:10:00]  video  some maid  it seems though  that he had  some energy  there  that he was  you know  in good spirits  and everybody  you know  who was part  of that tour  saying you know  Ortega and  company all saying  you know  it was the best  I'd ever seen  him  these are the  same people  who have said  I hate this  guy's voice  by the way  he's very  hated  anyone else  annoyed by  just the tone  of his voice  the voice  alone  is horrid  what's he 
[03:10:30]  look like  I've got a fist  up my ass  but I'll  continue the  interview  sounds like  Mr.  Mackey  a little bit  I can't  stand his  voice  I can't  stand what  he's saying  let me see a  picture of him  so I could  just completely  not like  this guy  here we go  look at him 
[03:11:00]  a big  A  is that  really him  no that's  not him  right  you're kidding  he's like a  parody of an  ass  you're joking  right  that can't  be him  come on  what good  what good  Sam's whispering  what good  Foxnews.com  self-hating  what's up  Sam  what's the matter  Sam  nobody liked him  because of the  color of his skin  you're right  good point  you fucking  blithering idiot  same way they  didn't like powder 
[03:11:30]  in the movie  yes Sam  I was just telling  Danny that he's  got to see the  video of this  interview from  Foxnews.com  because he wears  these big  plastic white  sunglasses  of course he does  with like pink  lenses  very Hollywood  the guy's the  biggest star in  the world  shut up  let's go to  Tim and  everybody was  like talking  about him  and kissing  his ass  Tim  yo  hey Tim  what's going  on man  hey you guys 
[03:12:00]  are talking  about this  douchebag  yeah  I was  listening  I've flipped  between Howard  and you guys  in the morning  Howard  just threw  him kind of  softball  questions man  he really  didn't dig  into him  like you  guys should  have  yeah  that's why  people have  got to  stop with  you know  that we're  doing the  same show  as Howard  our show  is so  fucking  different  I can't  even tell  you  how do  you listen  to that  voice  and what  that guy  just said  and not  attack  this  douche  dude  he is  such a  moron  I mean  he's  talking  oh it's  the color  of his  skin  no one  gives a  shit  no one  gave a  shit  no one  cares  man  if there 
[03:12:30]  was a  more  accepted  black  slash  white  guy  it was  Michael  Jackson  exactly  man I  agree  with you  guys  100%  alright  thank you  guys  trying to  make  controversy  get him  on the  show  wouldn't it  have been  better at  that point  to come  out of the  closet  and say  you're  gay  with all  the pedophile  charges  and everything  else  yeah  the fuck  is this  guy  talking  about  no that  wouldn't  it wouldn't  have helped  his cause  though  because people  see a lot  of gay  guys as  pedos  anyway  like there's  that misconception  that if  you're gay 
[03:13:00]  you're more  dangerous  around kids  so that  would have  just hurt  his cause  that's great  he's so cool  he's just silly  he's like a silly  video killed  the radio star  yeah he's in  the buggles  really the color  of his skin  alright this  looks like one  of Biff's  cronies  you're a Biff  crony  these are the  same people 
[03:13:30]  who have said  repeatedly  that he's  fully healthy  that he's fully  healthy  I know people  who were at  that video  shoot  who I've  talked to  have you  talked to  anyone at  that video  shoot  it looks  like dice  it kind of  does look  like dice  from this  angle  they asked  Larry King  asked somebody  last night  some nobody  that if  Michael Jackson  didn't die  and he did  all these  concerts in  London  would it be  successful  and would he  have the big  comeback 
[03:14:00]  hell fucking  no  he would have  done two or  three and the  whole thing  would have  fell apart  that's obvious  to everybody  alive  in the past  few times  he's been  out  no one's  cared  Europe gives  a shit  Japan gives  a shit  United States  could be like  your old hat  old news  have you talked  to anyone at  that video  shoot  I've seen  them  I've not  personally  talked to  them  I have  what went  down here  one of his  choreographers  told me  this was not  the Michael  Jackson of  old  of course 
[03:14:30]  not  the guy  is fucking  50  he was 50  he's comparing  him to the  like the 25  year old  Michael Jackson  and this one's  white  he's not like  the Michael  Jackson of  old  he's no  longer a  black man  what an idiot  this guy  but look at  it positively  we could write  a Michael  Jackson book  yeah  if this guy  can do it  of course  he wasn't  he's 50  he's gonna be  a little slower  probably  were you at  the rehearsal  were you there 
[03:15:00]  well I was  well I wasn't  either but I  talked to a guy  that was  some guy  that's what he  said  that's pretty  much what he  said  were you there  no  neither was I  he sounds like  Cameron calling  Mr. Rooney  in first place  Rooney  Rob L  in South Carolina  Michael Jackson  wasn't he  were you there  well I talked  to a choreographer  I want the  choreographer  outside  Rooney  it's all mad 
[03:15:30]  oh fuck  it was not  the Michael  Jackson of  old  and I urge  you to look  closely at that  video  his moves were  out of sync  he was sluggish  this is not  in my words  that's according  to one of his  choreographers  that one bit  of the clip  well  they show  just a little  bit of it  I mean I  know they're  talking about  maybe releasing  a bigger  talk about  profiteering  I mean Michael  Jackson's worth  much more  debt than  alive to these  folks 
[03:16:00]  talk about  profiteering  by the way  my book  on mass  the final  year  what is he  talking about  don't use the  word profiteering  that's exactly what  you're doing  to show just a  little bit of  it  I know they're  talking about  maybe releasing  a bigger  talk about  profiteering  I mean Michael  Jackson's worth  much more  debt than  alive to these  folks  to you too  dummy  what a hypocrite  you don't have a  book if he doesn't  die  this guy's  everything awful  oh why  didn't we get 
[03:16:30]  him today  oh Christ  do I want that  guy sitting  down here  do I want that  guy sitting  right here  I want to be  here  no  yes  oh  wow  awful me  from whack bag  this guy sounds  like a former  station manager  boy  I was at  this final  rehearsal  were you at  the final  Opie and  Anthony show  but when they  said the mayor  died  well I was 
[03:17:00]  funny every  fucking time  this guy  is a  two wall  want to hear  more  please  I hate  this gentleman  I'm not  even going to  tell you what  this next  track is  about  because when  you hear  it you're  going to  fucking  blow a  gasket  all right  all right  I'm very  curious also  about the  final years  with Joe  Jackson  the relationship  you know  of course  people are  taking aim  at him  right now  and I  think  sometimes  in my  personal  opinion  rightly  so  because 
[03:17:30]  it seems  like he's  trying to  profit off  of his  in the  aftermath of  his son's  death  and the  concerns  about the  children  but that's  sort of  my  personal opinion  we got  it  but what  was that  relationship  you seem to  think we're  all trying to  profit but  that's fine  with all due  respect  I'm saying it  because there  are so many  people who do  love this man  and they  respect him  it's a very  fair comment  and the way  I'll answer  that is very  simple  I urge  I urge the  Jackson family  to take  a step 
[03:18:00]  back  they have  made some  grave errors  since Michael  has died  Joe has  come out  and said  he wants  to start  he's starting  his own  record label  a couple  days after  Michael was  dead  yes  he's already  he wants  to sign  some of the  children  and possibly  put them  on tour  this is not  the time  to be making  those decisions  what has  to happen  right now  is to find  a stable  comfortable  environment  for those 
[03:18:30]  three precious  children  that's where  their energy  should be  focused  right now  and not  making  these outrageous  public statements  outrageous public statements  you said the guy  sucks cock  you dummy  it's in a book  they can read  you fucking  asshole  the guy  said he  sucks a dick  and put  dresses on  to go out  cruising  for guys  what did he say  the king of pop  is going to  lick your  lollipop  that comes  from your  book  asshole  these three  precious  children  you fucking 
[03:19:00]  asshole  he's the biggest  hypocrite ever  this guy  is a douche  it's not time  for any of that  he sounds like  frankenfurter  this is creepy  well it's not  so bad  it's not all  that bad  wow I want  more clips  of this guy  now that's  all we have  dumb sunglasses  this isn't the  time  I want the  Jackson family  to step back  and look  at these  three precious  children  by the way  did I tell you  he liked  taking it  in the ass  and then  ass to mouth 
[03:19:30]  he went  ass to mouth  I hope the  children aren't  watching right  now  because I  gotta sell  some books  yeah I gotta  sell some  books  it puts  the book  in the basket  fuck I was  right there  Jimmy  I fucked  me hard  Michael Jackson  what did  yeah he put  a dress on  and went to  city hotels  in Vegas  we found  that out  because of  you asshole  god this  guy is a 
[03:20:00]  dick  holy shit  is he a  dick  I would  assume Howard  beat him up  that's  that's obvious  we like taking  our shots  but come on  I mean Howard  did the right  thing right  I don't know  this guy  is a  fucking  asshole  look at  those glasses  here  this is a  blatant case  of discrimination  discrimination  by people  and it's  as the old  the old  saying goes  when you go  to the  court  sometimes 
[03:20:30]  seeking  justice  you see  just us  you're not  black  holy shit  who's this  self-hating  Jewish guy  what is it  self-hating  fucking  rich  want to  look like  he's  fucking  when he  found out  from my  sources  that it's  going to  be positive  and fair  he became  more involved  did he  I'm very  curious also  about the  final years  with Joe  Jackson  the relationship  because so  much of what  you know  we hear  of a tortured 
[03:21:00]  relationship  and yet  here she goes  on and on  babbling  just asked a  question  what happened  with Joe  Jackson  done  question  question  you're  editorializing  question  this is a  statement  question  my  French  that's  fine  with all due  respect  I'm trying to  find more  audio  on this  guy  it's very 
[03:21:30]  fair comment  and  the way  I'll answer  that is  very simple  very simple  I urge  the Jackson  family  urge them  to take  a step  back  they have  made some  grave errors  since Michael  has died  and you  put it on the  wrong hole  he's starting  his own  record label  where's he  from this guy  yes  he's already  got to be  from Los  Angeles  Hollywood  California  with those  shades  well no  that's where  he is now 
[03:22:00]  he obviously  embodied  California  but where  did he  where's that  accent  from  oh  asshole ville  he's from  Assington  did he  annoy you  yes  yeah  I hate  this guy  he's a  phony  lump  of shit  ugh  can we  still get  him tomorrow  oh please  why not  yeah  get him  we should  get him  on the show 
[03:22:30]  tomorrow  yes  I want  to hear  that voice  live  Canadian  oh he's  Canadian  I love  the way  Canadians  handle  race  you can't  do like  racial  comments  on Canadian  radio  it's worse  than anything  that's their  sense  their thing  don't make  any racial  comments  so of course  they're completely  in touch  with racism  in the United  States  completely in  touch with it  because they're  elitist white 
[03:23:00]  people who just  pretend it  doesn't exist  sometimes when  you're looking  for justice  all you see  is just us  yes  what a white  Jewish guy  Canadian  asshole  yeah  and a former  black man  what are you  talking about  in December  2008  Halverin  had predicted  Jackson had  six months  to live  that's pretty  good  did he  that's  really  did he  say that  uh yeah  I want  fucking  documentation  it was in  the third  quadrant  I don't  know the 
[03:23:30]  other  quatrains  my  quatrains  I don't  believe  one word  out of  this  dildo's  mouth  I really  don't  but he  can't have  a dildo  mouth  he's  creskin  that's  impossible  well  it can sense  to be able to  talk around one  right  in his fucking  mouth  why don't we  make you  happy  because Sam  went backstage  and got to  the bottom  of something  very important  that's happening  around here  it's true  shitting on  Iraq  how did you  know  once again 
[03:24:00]  take note  that Iraq  hasn't done  anything wrong  today  we haven't  even seen  him in  two hours  no no  but we  have to  do this  he's been  working  I gather  doing something  and yesterday  we had a good  laugh at the  fact that  we make him  come in here  just to shit  all over him  and then he  goes back  with his head  down and  goes back  to his job  and we just  like  we enjoy  shitting all  over this  gentleman  and someone's  trying to bring  back the  warrior bit  which is one  of my favorites  of all time 
[03:24:30]  spanky writes  warrior says  jackal likes  to walk  warrior  and now  backstage  with ONA  here is  primetime  Sam Roberts  I'm primetime  Sam Roberts  and we caught  intern Pierce  looking like a  man on a  mission  we approach  the young  buck  to see  what the  hubbub  was all  about  Pierce  you look  like you're  on a  mission  what are  you up  to  I'm looking 
[03:25:00]  for the  lost  condiments  what lost  condiments  well there's a  drawer in  Iraq's desk  where he keeps  a lot of  condiments  for like ketchup  and mayonnaise  and hot sauce  he has a  condiment drawer  in his desk  at work  yeah he does  and uh  they went  missing  do you think  that's funny  that he has a  condiment drawer  yeah  it is pretty  funny  when news  of a  condiment  drawer came  up  we had  to get  the scoop  so we went  to the  chubby bunny  himself  Erock  for the  details 
[03:25:30]  Erock  what's Pierce  doing  not a whole  fucking lot  he doesn't do  anything you ask  him  did you hear  what I talked  to him about  a little bit  ago  I think so  I think it  involves the  condiment drawer  why do you  have a  condiment drawer  it's a communal  condiment drawer  it's the  continuation of  Kenny's  ketchup drawer  from K-Rock  but why is it  in your desk  because there's  nowhere else  to put it  there's plenty  of other places  to put it  I don't fucking  know  they were here  and now they're  gone  I just asked  what happened 
[03:26:00]  to them  how much  mayonnaise  was in the  condiment drawer  actually none  we had ketchup  we had salt  and pepper  and there was  a lot of  hot sauce  in here  what you put  hot sauce  on  I don't eat  hot sauce  then why'd  you keep  it in your  condiment drawer  because it  was for  everybody  not for me  then how come  you were the  only one who  knew about it  everybody knew  about it  obviously a  gauntlet was  thrown down  so we found  the ONA staff  and asked how  many of them  knew of  E-Rock's  condiment stash  hey Troy  did you know  Eric Nagel 
[03:26:30]  has a condiment  drawer  no I didn't  know that  hey Steve C  did you know  Eric has a  condiment drawer  no  hey Derek  did you know  Eric has a  condiment drawer  no  club study  candy  did you know  Eric Nagel  has a condiment  drawer  negative  Danny did you  know Eric  has a condiment  drawer  no I did  not know  where is it  located  in his desk  with our  point proven  we went to  E-Rock  for a final  word  Eric I  asked around  nobody knows  about your  condiment drawer  well whoever  started it  I just added  to it  obviously you  started it  no I  didn't start 
[03:27:00]  are you  depressed  about the  depletion  of your  condiments  no I'm  not depressed  about it  are you sure  you didn't  just eat  them all  I'm positive  nobody knew  about your  drawer  really  then how  did it  get empty  because you  ate all  the condiments  no I  didn't eat  all the  condiments  obviously  you did  my drawer  is empty  and I  want it  returned  you said  it's your  drawer  after an  admission  by E-Rock  mystery solved  next time  eat your  condiments  more slowly  little E-Rock  there's enough  mayo for  everyone  I'm primetime  Sam Roberts  and this has  been Backstage 
[03:27:30]  with ONA  very good  god damn  my favorite  part is when  you come back  to him  and he just  says fuck  you  oh look at  this slob  is doing an  eating a food  segment  the monster  is cooking  today  the monster  okay look  at our  waistline  tell me  tell me  she's fucking  got a slim  waist  stop it  Jimmy says  she's got a  slim waist  no Sam  did  Sam did  Sam did  yes  she's a  beast  she's beastly  and then  beyond that 
[03:28:00]  huge waistline  is a giant  ass  she shouldn't  be doing  an eating  segment  Wendy Williams  we're talking  about  recipes  yeah  yeah  she has a  whole section  on her  website  for recipes  does she  but she  does  yeah  fucking  lard  fried lard  no that's  not there  how to cook  some champagne  she's class  she's all  class  yo  who's the  other fat  bitch next  to her  I know  does she  know any  skinny people 
[03:28:30]  why do we  hate her  so much  someone wrote  me yesterday  and said  you know  she stood  up for you  guys when  you got  fired  you always  fucking go  after the  people that  try to do  the right  thing  although one  of the funniest  things I heard  on her show  was when  Imus got  fired  and you  were doing  the Imus  impression  on our  show  she goes  some  listener  called into  her show  when they  were talking  about Imus  and goes  you know  Imus isn't  even sorry  he called  into the  Opie and  Anthony show  this morning  and he 
[03:29:00]  was just  making fun  of the  whole thing  he wasn't  sorry at  all  what'd she  say to  that  she believed  the call  dumb  listeners  dumb  monster  why would  you believe  that  I guess  he rocks  hiding  yeah he's  probably searching  for his  condiments  still  he was so  worried about  it  he was  sending our  interns out  that we  need them  to do  very important  tasks  so he  really did  send the  intern out  for  I had  no idea  this  condiment  drawer  existed  until  Pierce  was asking  around 
[03:29:30]  hey  have you  guys seen  the condiments  good one  Jim  what happened  Jim  are you  scared  frightened  I didn't  know  I thought  it was a  cough  an ass  cough  we gotta get  this one  last story  out of the  way  the Brooklyn  library  it's quick  oh yeah  yeah this is  a stupid  fucking story  what year is  this  what fucking  year is  this  who goes  to the  library  exactly

[03:36:30]  well do we have that one again travis  maybe we have it  sorry you're doing it  travis  i'm sure derrick already has it for some production fees  let's go  let's hear it again  come on i hear it  give me one second  i gotta find you  all right let me get  he's plugging his ears up  all right  this is fantastic  let me get the second half of the story out then  we'll get this out of the way  just as outraged  assemblyman dove hyken  he wants the library to pull all its vhs tapes  and instead only loan out dvds  that can't be recorded on  oh shit  so no child is accidentally exposed to graphic sex acts 
[03:37:00]  shut up  we've talked to a number of professionals  you know  is this really damaging to a 70 year old or a 12 year old  if they're going to watch  uh you know  all this stuff  and they've said it could be absolutely devastating  believe it or not  this isn't the first time this has happened at a public library  in fact hyken says there's been several cases where people borrowed pg and pg-13 rated films  only to find hardcore pornography at the end  brooklyn public library says it would be unfair to pull every vhs tape  due to the large number of customers who haven't upgraded to dvd 
[03:37:30]  the library admits since january 18 tapes of the 35,000 were recorded over with porn  but told us the guy responsible was busted  and to their knowledge all the altered cassettes were removed  jesus  vhs  enough  you deserve porn if you're still renting fucking vhs tapes  not that porn's a bad thing  but  uh tim in south carolina  there's an entire bit in austin powers about a penis pump  yeah yeah the penis pump bit  tuavis  you guys want to hear a really funny joke  yeah

[03:38:30]  yeah  they spliced in some silence  just  silent tape  yeah  it's like  it's like one of nixon's tapes  with the erased seven minutes  this is a power failure  just jealous of my pornography knowledge  that's what this is all about  you know the best part is  is that he laughs to himself  before he tells  the show  yeah  it's the gem coming folks  chuckle  and let me  let me let you in on a little  inside information  uh people  danny was typing it 
[03:39:00]  on the screen  for somebody in the studio to use  and then decided  you know what  i'm grabbing this motherfucker  yeah  this one's mine  i'm running with this one  this one's mine  you don't give that one away  you can go back to trying to rhyme doctor with something if you want  i mean  oh  danny doesn't take a bomb very well  what can we rhyme doctor with  um  let's see  um  or you want to do some top ten gum  shocked her  shocked her

[03:40:30]  he was in cocktails  they just put on a box set of 25 movies on dvd for crews  all right good for him  25  well that's a little egotistical don't you think  it would only cost 30 dollars  well that's a good bargain  i hear his arguing to have it not called a box set  yeah  exactly  something else  every time his friends try to pick it up they vomit  he wants it called a fart box set  it was a double  boy  you're a little too enthusiastic 
[03:41:00]  you raised your hand and everything  i would say  if you didn't  if you didn't point at the outfield like babe ruth  that might have been a more solid hit  you got that one travis  yeah he's got it  apparently he did  that's the one that danny's never been able to forget about  that's the one he's reminded of literally  i forget about it all the time  at least four times a week  somebody goes  danny what do you think it was  in a fart box  no way

[03:44:00]  there was someone else in the studio  and she looked like  the gay guy from Boogie Nights  and I tried referencing it  in some way  it didn't work  but no one heard it  but Jim  and Jim was like  what was that  and I thought he was trying  to set me up  to get a big laugh  oh no  you would have felt that one  and I totally said it again  did he get a laugh  well  because it was  it was terrible  Jimmy hit the rope  and went  I heard it  that was a tough one  nothing better than  getting a bomb repeated  if you can pull that off
