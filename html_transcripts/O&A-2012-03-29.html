<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with several commercial breaks featuring ads for Tiesto's Club Life Radio, Mosey Pro, Goldworth Financial, Newegg Business, Shell gasoline, and Let's Yo!  The show then launched into a segment heavily focused on the George Zimmerman trial and its media coverage.  Opie and Anthony expressed their anger at Spike Lee for retweeting what he thought was Zimmerman's address, leading to the harassment of an innocent elderly couple. They criticized the poor quality of news reporting, citing a blurry video obscuring key details of Zimmerman at the police station and mocking Congresswoman Corinne Brown's inability to recall the name of a murdered white woman while easily remembering Trayvon Martin’s name.  The hosts also ridiculed various news outlets' graphic overlays and aired their frustrations with the SiriusXM app, even considering leaving the platform due to technical issues.  Comedic moments included listener-submitted phrases ("my dick's all shitty"), a discussion of wrestler Kamala's declining health (detailed by his son), and a caller's account of the high crime rate in Congressman Hank Johnson's district (a clip of Johnson's infamous Guam comment was played).  A clip of a congressman wearing a hoodie on the floor of Congress was also shown and discussed in relation to the Trayvon Martin case.  David Tell was scheduled to be a guest, and E-Rock made a brief appearance.

Next, the show featured a "Cock Talk" segment with Mistress Vixen interviewing a caller named Mars from Puerto Rico about his first homosexual experience, including graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  Returning to Opie and Anthony, the hosts discussed a debt one owed E-Rock, seemingly from a wrestling match,  briefly touched upon Hulk Hogan's WrestleMania anniversary, making disparaging remarks about him, and discussed the murder of a Georgia congressional candidate by the former sheriff, and Cynthia McKinney's controversial history.  They criticized Carson Daly's apology for a joke about a plane full of overweight men, commenting on modern apology culture.

The conversation shifted to politically correct practices in schools, highlighting words removed from NYC standardized tests (dinosaurs, pools, computers, poverty, slavery, terrorism, Easter Bunny) due to potential offense.  The removal of "snowman" (replaced with "snow buddy") was also discussed, sparking humorous speculation and discussion of parental outrage.  A caller, Joe from Long Island, engaged in a heated debate with the hosts about creationism versus evolution, joined by other callers.  This debate covered carbon dating, the age of the Earth, and the role of faith in science, often with insulting exchanges.  The discussion then turned to Sam's baseball hat choices, leading to a conversation on race and fashion, particularly concerning differences in hat-wearing habits between white and black people.  Troy Kwan’s nose job and perceived betrayal of Opie and Anthony, and a human rights complaint against Earl's restaurant for its "Albino Rhino" beer line (with the hosts offering offensive opinions) were also discussed.  The segment concluded with further humorous banter among the hosts.

The final segment focused on a pilot who suffered a mid-flight mental breakdown and was subdued by the co-pilot. The hosts and callers speculated on the incident, the co-pilot's actions, the existence of a cockpit access code, pilot pairing systems ("speed dating"), and the pilot's erratic behavior.  The discussion included crude and offensive language and humorous scenarios, veering into tangents about air traffic controllers, a ridiculed "duck call family" reality TV show, and the hosts' upcoming tour.  While no in-studio guests were explicitly named in this segment, callers participated in the conversation. The show maintained its characteristic irreverent and offensive style throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wake the fuck up!  What the fuck is going on?!  We're waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy,  the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  He's got to try to fight!  Oh my God!  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, it's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Oprah and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  I'll figure it out.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi, everyone out there.  In Radioland.  Didn't we just do this?  Just did it.  I walked out that door to the studio.  Yeah.  I went to the elevator.  Yeah.  I turned around, came back, sat down, and now here I am. 
[00:01:00]  In one week, we'll do a month's worth of podcasts.  Yeah.  No, no.  Wait, what more than that?  Right?  In one week...  16 podcasts?  No, in one week, we will do...  Four podcasts a day.  20 weeks of podcasting.  Because a lot of you are checking out the podcasts out there.  I'm checking out a lot of podcasts.  I was telling Anthony today.  And these guys are doing a nice hour once a week.  Sure.  And it seems like the fan base of these individuals, that's good enough for them. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Well, in one week, we'll do 20 weeks of podcasting.  Just put it in the can.  That means in three weeks, we'll do over a year of podcasts.  Shove it in the can.  Yeah.  There's a whole new world out there.  And I'm paying attention, that's for sure.  Spike Lee should be arrested.  Breaking news, Spike Lee should be arrested.  I think anybody else would in that situation.  We'd be fired and probably have some kind of charges put against us if we even put out 
[00:02:00]  somebody's address out there with the intent of having some kind of violence perpetrated  on them.  Spike Lee should be arrested.  Is anyone saying this?  Is anyone even covering this story at all on the TV?  Well, he apologized.  He had no comment, and then he apologized.  It doesn't matter if he apologized.  This is a case where he should be arrested.  He's sending people to the wrong...  First of all, he shouldn't have done it in the first place.  Second of all, he's sending people to the wrong address. 
[00:02:30]  Whoops.  What's the law if you retweet something?  Yeah, that's right.  Because you retweeted it.  It gets a little dodgy.  It gets weird.  Like, yeah, what is it if you're...  If he retweeted?  Yeah.  But he's like, he's the face of this whole controversy, right?  Yeah.  Well...  I mean, of that...  Yeah, yeah.  Citing.  He was inciting some people to perhaps perpetrate violence upon whoever lived at that house.  He thought it was George...  Jorge Zimmerman.  Jorge!  Jorge Zimmerman, the gentleman... 
[00:03:00]  It's in a bit of a jam-up these days.  Is his real name Jorge?  No, it's George Zimmerman, but I'm calling him Jorge because he's Hispanic.  Yeah.  And it's Jorge.  Because Whitey doesn't want to be involved with this one.  Nah, nah.  We just don't want to be involved with this one.  Nah, nah.  So Spike Lee apparently read a tweet that included what was purported to be Jorge Zimmerman's address.  Right.  And then he retweeted it.  And with some of the other stories out there, like the, what is it, the fucking New Black Panthers 
[00:03:30]  saying that there's a $10,000 bounty out, dead or alive for Jorge Zimmerman.  They're now saying dead or alive.  Well, they said that right from the start, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I thought they were trying to keep it, you know, a little vague.  No, no.  Oh, I didn't know they went dead or alive.  They're clown shoes.  I know what they were, you know, assuming with their statement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Spike Lee should be fucking brought in for questioning.  Yeah.  Questioning.  He really should. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Get him off the fucking basketball court over there at MSG and question this fucking freak.  Yeah, it's really, um, it, he had, he had a motive there, you know, and what he did was,  uh, was wrong.  He, he gave the wrong address.  Very irresponsible.  Gave the address to some elderly couple.  Uh, it couldn't have been a worse situation.  I was telling you before the show and the message certainly, uh, didn't get to everyone  that it's the wrong address.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  So I, I would assume that couple is not in that address right now, right?  No, they had to, uh, yeah, they had to flee the house for fear of their lives.  They probably been in that house 50 years.  Oh yeah.  And now they have to flee it.  Not a problem.  Live somewhere else and forever.  Probably.  I don't know if you ever go back.  Yeah.  Spike Lee decides, uh, he's going to give their address out and, um, cause all kinds  of problems.  And even the fact that he thought it was Zimmerman's address and, and tweeted it, what, what's the,  what is any motive there besides, Hey, here's his address. 
[00:05:00]  Go over there and, and hurt him, hurt him or fuck him up or something.  There's no other motive there.  Absolutely.  What's sightsee in front of his house?  What leave donations for the poor gentleman?  I don't think that's what he, have a talk with him.  Yeah.  I don't think that's what his motives.  Have a discussion.  Yeah.  So that's, uh, I don't know if that's, uh, is that gaining, uh, momentum, this Spike Lee  thing?  A little bit, but not as much as, uh, you know, other stories like, uh, Zimmerman's, um, uh,  surveillance tape when he was brought to the police station. 
[00:05:30]  That one's got a lot of, um, legs because it, uh, kind of, it supposedly shows that Zimmerman,  um, didn't have all these bruises and broken nose and cut to the head that, uh, the police  report has.  Well, we're, witnesses say he has.  We're looking at the tape right now.  The problem with this surveillance is it's from, uh, above and it's, and it's kind of  far away.  And, and, and you think it looks clear.  It's, it's really not, there's some on his temple right there.  You can see a little something in his eye, the top of his right eye.  You could see something there. 
[00:06:00]  And before he's brought into that room.  So why are they saying barely scratched?  Well, because they expect the thing over his eye from even this angle looks pretty, pretty  bad.  Yeah.  And like you said before the show, they certainly cleaned him up before they brought  him in.  The EMTs cleaned him up.  And, uh, is that a lump on the back of his head?  Well, or, or is that that lump?  Most of us.  Yeah.  That's a lump.  Most.  I don't, I'm not sure.  Do you have one of those lumps back there?  Yeah.  Everybody's got like that little bumpy, bumpy thing on the back of your head, but it was  more on the top of his head and you see it better in another shot. 
[00:06:30]  And you could see one of the officers as he turns around, kind of, he's looking over  the back of his head for some apparent reason.  I don't know.  Again, this is just another thing that will go in, um, to be considered during an investigation.  Um, yeah, but a lot of people are going to look at that video today and, and, and really  believe there's not a scratch.  Oh, they already have.  I had all kinds of arguments last night on Twitter about that tape and, uh, what it shows  or doesn't show.  And what is Lawrence O'Donnell saying about this?  Can you start this over?  This Lawrence O'Donnell is a creep. 
[00:07:00]  Lawrence O'Donnell.  After the killing of Trayvon Martin, this police video obtained by ABC News shows Zimmerman  arriving at the police station in Sanford, Florida, with a, in handcuffs, with a graphic  over his face.  Killing Trayvon Martin.  Good work.  And in an exclusive report by Lawrence O'Donnell.  There is a breaking news graphic.  The fucking news is fucking terrible.  For half the clip.  I'm so glad we played this.  A breaking news graphic right over, uh, George Zimmerman's face and head, the most important 
[00:07:30]  part of the video.  And know what the breaking news is?  Police video shows no signs of fucking blood or bruises on Zimmerman.  On Zimmerman.  And it was that, that graphic is right over Zimmerman's face.  You cannot see it.  That's right over the video.  These idiots.  What lazy fucking shitheads these people are.  Why can't these guys figure out, okay, we got this video, someone's gotta quickly look  and go, okay, the graphic's gonna fuck this up, so let's move the graphic over. 
[00:08:00]  Un-fucking-believable.  Or just take it down, right.  Right.  But it's right over Zimmerman's head.  Oh, my dear Lord.  What idiots.  Jimmy's-  Ha ha, there it is.  Look at that shit.  Jimmy's gonna tweet it.  Jimmy's gonna tweet it.  This is how bad the media is.  Directly over his face.  They can't even do basic shit.  You got this, you got this gold.  In the industry, it's like, holy shit, we got gold today.  Right.  We got a video of Zimmerman.  It looks like he doesn't have a scratch whatsoever.  Obviously, we disagree with that here on this show.  And then they don't even show the video because there's stupid graphics in the way. 
[00:08:30]  Un-fucking-believable.  How dumb is that?  That graphic, these graphics that they're putting on the news channels, are so intrusive  when they're showing clips.  But this one is beautiful.  Yeah.  It's right over Zimmerman's head.  If they're going with breaking news and stuff that they can't look at beforehand, first  of all, anything that they have planned to show, they should look at it and go, okay,  how is the graphic going to interfere with this clip, and let's move the graphic. 
[00:09:00]  Sure.  If they're doing some kind of live thing where they couldn't have looked at it beforehand,  they need somebody on the switch to the graphic.  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  That's somebody that's their fucking job.  That when they see...  You shrink that shit, put it in the corner.  Right.  You put it in the corner, you get rid of it, you do something, because the clip is the  important part, not the fucking graphic, you dummies.  Looking at MSNBC right now, well, CNN and Fox, they're all doing it right now.  How lazy.  They are, I would say their graphics take up an eighth of the screen right now. 
[00:09:30]  It's very intrusive.  And it's all nonsense.  Yeah.  It's nothing.  It's all stuff you don't need.  You don't need that it's March 29th on the screen.  Who needs that?  Flashy fucking branding.  Who needs that?  Branding.  Who needs the live thing?  Yeah.  No one, or the economy.  Household owns at least one Apple.  Who's reading that at the bottom of the fucking TV?  Nobody's reading that shit.  You're going, oh, oh.  Why do you need a giant graphic that says top talkers?  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  And then it has, you know, like little news stories to the right of top talkers.  So why wouldn't you just get rid of top talkers and just have the news shit?  And it's what they're talking about, so we know.  Oh, God.  Let's go back to Lawrence O'Donnell.  I would have to assume that he thinks there's not a scratch on Zimmerman.  Wow.  Is that fucking.  That is as lazy and terrible a job as you can do.  It makes me fucking.  How?  I'm not even mad.  I'm like, you dopes.  You fucking dopes. 
[00:10:30]  That's like us having like some massive fucking, you know, breaking news on our show.  And we have like, we have circus music.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really loud.  Right.  Hit this.  Trayvon Martin and an exclusive report by NBC News, the griot dot com.  A source with knowledge of the investigation says it was then Sanford police chief Bill  Lee, along with Captain Robert O'Connor, the investigative investigation supervisor who 
[00:11:00]  made the decision to release George Zimmerman from those handcuffs on the night of February  26th after.  It goes on forever.  It's it's very detailed.  This is another thing that comes into play that will be added to the investigation and  be looked at.  You know, it's part of it.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's this clip from the representative?  This is Brown of Florida.  I don't know about this one.  I'm out.  This is fucking classic. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Uh, Corinne, what's her name?  Uh, Brown.  Corinne Brown.  Um, she was speaking to, uh, amazingly enough on this clip, CNN, who is usually known for  being very, uh, liberal and left-leaning and, uh, not really, uh, uh, oppressing when somebody  is speaking of, uh, their agenda.  Okay.  Uh, but this woman is talking about how, um, uh, Trayvon, you know, the whole Trayvon  situation and, uh, the, the need for justice for Trayvon and, uh, you know, the usual battle 
[00:12:00]  cry of, uh, especially black lawmakers.  That's what she looks like.  Uh, yeah.  And, uh, the, she, what is on her head?  The CNN reporter.  That's not on her head, is it?  I know.  The CNN reporter asked her something very, very, um, very important.  Okay.  And, um, well, you gotta see for yourself.  If we could play it from the, from there, it'd be easier because you gotta watch the  video and watch this fucking, um, lying sack of shit, uh, woman. 
[00:12:30]  We don't have a visual element, so they can't watch.  They can't watch along with us.  I was talking to Jimmy, uh, but.  Yeah, but the people at home, I mean, it's up online.  They can't watch.  Well, how come we don't have, they can't watch with us?  Because, uh, they can't figure out the visual element.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  They really want us.  We should mention it one time.  They really want us to just do archaic fucking radio for the rest of our careers.  You know.  But that ain't happening.  Things will change one way or the other.  We're the black and white TV of radio.  Why can't you have, like, a, like, a special little, I don't know, you, you make these guys  maybe pay an extra buck or something for the visual element if you need to make money 
[00:13:00]  off this stupid thing.  Yeah.  Because now everyone could go, oh, they're doing a visual thing.  Cool.  I'm going to go check it out alongside them.  Then the lawyers would have to look at every clip.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They would just, oh, is there nudity?  Is there this?  Is there that?  They would have to, they would ruin it.  Yeah, they would.  I'm telling you.  I'm heading, I'm heading toward a land with no lawyers.  Oh.  Are you heading toward a land with no lawyers?  I'm already there.  I'm heading there.  I'm already there.  I fucking called Mark Maron and asked about equipment that he uses. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  I'm telling you, and I'm not bluffing, every show I do, people are like, are you guys leaving?  It sounds like every fucking show people ask that.  No, we're leaving unless they've really fucking figured this shit out.  We finally had it.  Yeah.  The funny thing is we, I guess technically, I guess we didn't have it two years ago, so  we had to, we re-signed or whatever.  But this time, no, man.  I've been lining my ducks up for fucking a couple of years now.  Slowly lining them up. 
[00:14:00]  I'm not going to lie to you.  I wouldn't mind staying here if they could figure it out.  Yeah, of course.  But I ain't doing what we're doing now.  Fuck no.  There has to be drastic changes.  We're not going to lose our audience if we leave here.  I know that now.  I've done that live from the compound.  It's fun, dude.  It's fucking fun to have that visual element.  It is fun to have the visual element right there.  You know, you just need something.  Like a story like this, it'd be nice.  You pop it on.  And you could replay it and shit on her and make fun of her.  I could stack graphics up and make it like really intrusive and horrible, kind of funny. 
[00:14:30]  And why would the lawyers get involved?  What's the difference between, like Imus gets to, Imus has a visual element every day.  Jimmy did Imus yesterday.  So what would the problem be if we're playing clips?  My only guess would be that they're a news show.  We're a news source.  We're news.  I'm only guessing that's what they would say.  Well, it's not what I do about it.  I'm not sure.  I'm not.  15 past the hour.  We do news. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  We do news better than the news people.  Of course we do.  I have no doubt about it, but these assholes will call us shock jocks until we retire.  Shock jocks.  You dopes.  We run circles around most of you, if not all of you.  Shock jocks.  Yeah.  Well, can you do something for me today?  What's that?  Not now.  Is it wrong with snow job?  Oh.  No, I don't need a snow job.  It's wrong with snow job.  You made Chris Isaac a lot of money yesterday.  I know.  You saw it on the Twitter?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  So many people downloaded their Wicked Games song yesterday.  People, they were like, I can't get it on my head.  Oh, I had to download the song.  I've been listening to it now all day.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan, Chris Isaac.  There's three.  I want to keep track of the things that are going on with the listeners.  There's three right now.  They're downloading Wicked Games by Chris Isaac.  They're walking around their house and where they were going, my dick's all shitty.  Yeah, my dick's all shitty is a big one.  They're like, why am I singing this? 
[00:16:00]  And I'm singing it out loud.  It does get stuck in your head.  And I'm sorry, man.  And you started it, but a lot more people are doing the sock foot pee thing.  I sure hope not for the sake of anybody out there that isn't doing it.  They're now tweeting me after they do it for the first time.  And they're like, why didn't I think of this before now?  Because it's disgusting.  Frank wants to know, how do I listen to a podcast?  Oh, Frank wants to know?  Oh, Frank was better.  We're not set up yet, but we will be.  Oh, boy, we'll be.  Well, you can go to iTunes and just put in Life on the Compound in the search, and I'll pop up. 
[00:16:30]  So you can watch that one in the meantime.  Can I ask you something about the app?  Can you just download the show and then, like, go forward and backwards and all that shit?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You mean the podcasting app?  No, the SiriusXM.  Oh, no.  Not yet.  God, why are you letting everyone catch up and go past you?  You can rewind the show on the app.  You can't download it, but I do...  Why can't you download the show yet? 
[00:17:00]  It's not.  The technology's not there yet.  So they can only listen live?  Yeah, or rewind it.  What do you mean?  You cannot download.  Right.  You can only...  You can rewind.  It's like a TiVo.  Like, you can rewind live programming, but you can't...  Up to a certain amount of time.  You can't go forward.  You can't download it.  Oh, right.  Like, if you start listening at 7.30, you can rewind back to 6, and then you can fast-forward  in spots.  Do these guys understand what's going on out there?  Right.  No.  I got, like, 12 podcasts on my phone right now. 
[00:17:30]  It takes seconds to download, and then I can listen whenever the fuck I want, and I  could rewind.  We got Audible.  I could go forward.  I could do whatever the fuck I want.  Why are we on iTunes or just Audible?  Audible feeds to iTunes.  You know what?  But not in the...  It doesn't...  It's not in a podcast.  If you remember, back in the days, XM was always, of the two companies, way ahead technologically.  Of course.  They saw things technologically.  So I don't know who's running this technology now, but if it's the same...  I don't know.  What are they? 
[00:18:00]  Technicians?  Well...  Technology, technicians, good gym.  Yeah, but those guys...  It's not surprising that they're...  Their business model was to pay one guy, and that was going to take care of everything.  And then the one guy is now, you know, kind of halfway retired and kind of hates the company  right now.  The floor would like to recognize E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yes, E-Rock.  Ouch.  Oh.  E-Rock.  Get off.  620. 
[00:18:30]  Reinforce me.  I have a check for you, too.  Thank you.  There's terrestrial shows that once they're done, about an hour after their show's done,  they have it set up for podcasting right off their radio sites.  They just let everyone catch up.  I mean, satellite radio was way the fuck ahead.  Yeah.  I remember Eric Logan going, the next big thing is going to be podcasts.  He knew it.  When did he say that?  When he was packing his fucking boxes for Oprah.  As he's putting his nameplate on top of the box.  But right until the end, he was giving us advice and what he thought the future was. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  He took me and Ann out for steak and said, within five years, this satellite radio is going  to be completely useless because of Wi-Fi.  And I laughed at it.  I'm like, yeah, what's this Wi-Fi thing?  What?  It might have been more than five years ago.  Wi-Fi.  But man, that came true, too.  Yeah.  He was a visionary, wasn't he?  Yeah.  He still is, I suppose.  Visual element.  And our app needs to be where they just download and they could fast forward or rewind and all  that shit.  He set all those cameras up in the studio, gave us a great studio. 
[00:19:30]  God damn it, man.  Oh, we're so out of here.  We have a CR app is what we have.  Get it?  An app?  No, Chip.  I don't want this company making more money off us.  Don't renew at this point until we figure it out.  Please don't do that to yourself.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't go that far.  Jesus.  I am.  Get me out of here.  Really?  Oh, boy.  I don't think-  Get me out of here.  They want to hear that.  Give us a fuck.  What have they done for us?  Nothing.  What have you done for me lately? 
[00:20:00]  They keep the after show on you, think?  Nope.  No, that thing goes.  No, because it'd be after what?  After what?  Oh, yeah, well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If there's nothing, then there's after nothing.  Besides, you're doing the shit show during that time.  How are you going to do both?  That's not a show.  Oh.  Unless Alex Bennett needs an after show.  I guess Jay Thomas said that we're, what, yesterday?  What did he say?  Eric, what did Jay Thomas say?  You know all this shit.  I don't know.  No one listens to him.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I saw Jay out by the computers there, sitting there. 
[00:20:30]  He's a pleasant guy.  You know.  How do you want to get along with everyone?  Well, it's just an easier world.  Isn't that boring?  Hmm.  No.  It's boring.  No, because I don't really have much of an interaction with the people that I'm pleasant  to around here.  I'm just mad that he took Ira away from us.  Well, that is infuriated.  And we're supposed to be one good, big, fucking happy company.  What did he say about the show?  We've never told our guys they can't do other radio shows.  Ira is scared to even talk to us in the hall. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  I was laughing, thinking about what you said yesterday about Ira in the bathroom.  That is so funny.  Never.  Never.  So, Ira, when are you going to do our show?  Never.  I could so picture her saying that.  I thought he would say something like, oh, I got to talk to Jay, whatever.  Never.  Never.  It made me laugh, man.  I got to be honest with you.  I wasn't pissed.  Oh, hells yeah.  So, where are we at?  We got this lady with the really bizarre fucking hair.  Way too much hair for her head. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  We have to fucking rewind a little bit.  So, where are we at with this?  Yeah, well, CNN, one of the very acute anchor girls, I guess, she was asking this woman some  questions about Trayvon.  This woman, of course, is outraged, and she's in Congress.  She's a congresswoman from where?  Yeah, she's a congresswoman from where?  Congresswoman.  Where the hell is she from?  Florida.  Florida?  Oh, Florida.  Well, she's right there.  And, well, the woman asked, the newswoman asks her a question that's very, very, you 
[00:22:00]  know, relative to the situation, and, well, let's see how this woman responds.  All right.  That's great.  Would you, would your fellow African-American lawmakers be as concerned about this case if  Trayvon wasn't black?  Oh, let me tell you something.  We had an incident in my area where a young white female.  Wanda Sykes?  I know.  Was murdered, and I was just as concerned. 
[00:22:30]  Absolutely.  I care about all of the children.  You know, you can make this.  Congresswoman Brown, what was her name?  The young lady that got killed.  Yes, ma'am.  In Orange County.  What was her name?  Yeah, yeah, the young lady that got killed.  No, no.  The point of the matter is, I don't remember her name, but we had all kinds of rallies in the  community in Jacksonville that I participated in, and I made sure that the sheriff's department 
[00:23:00]  had the money that they need to pursue the case.  So just don't try to act like this is just about this one black male.  Well, this is about all of the children.  And in fact, the Congressional Black Caucus is the conscience of the Congress, and we constantly  work to make things better.  Changing the subject.  And you know, I've served in this Congress for a long time, and I have seen what we call  a reverse robbing hood.  Robbing from the poor and working people to give tax breaks to the rich. 
[00:23:30]  Where is she going now?  We talk about it all the time.  She's panicking.  How can we elevate it?  How can we make a difference?  You're talking about deficits, but we're talking about investment in young people.  What?  She is flustered because she's full of shit.  The point is, I really do believe to whom God has given much, much is expected.  And we're here to try to make a difference for all young people. 
[00:24:00]  Congressman Green Brown, I hear you.  I often say, would America have a cold?  Africa.  This woman knows she got her, too.  Oh, yeah.  You got to replay that one clip she just said.  I appreciate the dialogue.  She just said something really.  Oh.  It's okay.  Yeah, you don't have to go that far.  She should have pushed it a little bit more, though.  Yeah.  You know, the reporter, let her in.  Much is expected.  And we're here to try to make a difference for all young people.  Congressman Green Brown, I hear you.  I often say, would America have a cold?  African-American have pneumonia. 
[00:24:30]  I hear the passion.  When America have a cold, African-American have pneumonia.  Wow.  What does that mean, you divisive fucking bitch?  Fuck this bitch.  Lion cunt.  I care about all that shit.  You know, we had a murder down here of a white girl.  What's her name?  I don't fucking know.  Just as important as Trayvon.  Oh, you know the name Trayvon.  And you didn't have any rallies or marches about a white girl.  Shut the fuck up, you lying sack of shit. 
[00:25:00]  She participated, though.  Oh, bullshit.  She's a liar.  Lying.  She couldn't remember the fucking girl's name.  Stop it.  Caught her.  Caught.  Caught.  She works for Congress.  She's a congresswoman.  Of course she is.  Why wouldn't she be?  That's scary.  And fucking hats off to that hottie on CNN.  Fox News is going to come a-knocking for that girl right there.  She probably got her ass eaten that night by a man. 
[00:25:30]  No, she probably got, like...  What are you doing?  She probably got her ass kicked by her bosses for that one.  Oh, you think?  Oh, I bet.  You know, we have her on a lot, and you made her look silly, and we don't do that on CNN  unless they're Republican.  They like her.  She's on every day.  Oh.  I forget her name, but she's on CNN every day.  The black girl or the white girl?  Oh, no, the white girl.  No, the white girl.  I forget her name.  Whitey.  Yeah, you forgot her name.  See, you're just like this woman.  Oh, God, yeah.  You're right.  That clip is so great, and I do, I think, if you're listening and you want to see it, you really 
[00:26:00]  should pop this up and take a look, because her panicked fucking face, when she can't  remember that name, she's looking over to the side to her people.  Help me, help me.  Like they're going to drop a cue card.  Right.  Or she's going to get one of Obama's teleprompters out there to help her out with this murdered  girl's name that's just as important as Trayvon.  Shut it.  You lying sick.  Yes.  I like that one.  Bravo. 
[00:26:30]  I'm glad.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  When do the riots start?  Well, if he isn't indicted by a grand jury, I think the riots will indeed start.  I don't know.  I'll tell you, a drudge report, I'm so happy drudge is there.  There's been too many missteps on the other side.  Spike Lee tweeting that address, it just looks ridiculous.  An older NAACP member criticizing Sharpton and Jackson.  Martin Luther King's now niece criticizing Sharpton and Jackson. 
[00:27:00]  It's kind of race baiting.  Yeah.  And drudge is putting out a lot of other stuff.  And I don't think Trayvon Martin was a bad.  I really, I think there's stuff about him getting out of a pot.  It's like, who gives a shit?  That's stupid.  I know.  But I'm talking about the people that aren't following this that closely.  And there are a lot of them.  I think those people will have some issues.  Maybe.  There will definitely be some flare-ups.  Yeah, there's people that are...  There's definitely going to be some things that happen.  Yeah, they're very, very passionate on that side. 
[00:27:30]  And if he's not indicted, you'll get a lot of people that aren't familiar with the case.  And all they know is some guy, supposedly white guy, shot a black, young, innocent man.  And when all they know is that, if something does happen and he's not indicted, or he is indicted, goes to trial and he's acquitted,  holy mother of pearl, there will be some shenanigans.  Did you see the hoodie guy?  Which one?  On the floor?  Yeah.  In Congress?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Hoodie guy.  Hoodie guy.  Who is trying to stay on script and get his outfit together at the same time.  It makes me laugh.  He can't do it.  Because he can't get it.  He's being yelled at.  He's trying to be calm as he takes off his suit jacket to show the hood.  And then he needs to put the hoodie up.  And the whole time he's still trying to talk.  And then he's like, he takes his glasses off.  He's trying to get the sunglasses on.  Yeah, he's trying to get sunglasses on and really pull the hoodie over his face.  And then the other guy's stammering as he's trying to tell him to stop.  Will the gentleman stop? 
[00:28:30]  But he doesn't say it like that.  But he's like, he's all over the place with it.  Do we have that clip?  I got confused with the whole thing.  And I started tweeting, I am Unabomber.  Oh, nice.  Because it really is a look that was stolen from said Unabomber.  But that's what he wore.  The hoodie, yeah.  So people didn't recognize him.  Or how about I am Phil Locke, the poker player, that just pulls up his hoodie and puts on his sunglasses  so no one could read his face. 
[00:29:00]  For the love of God.  Do you remember that V graphic in the final lost for V?  They had that bright fucking V on the TV.  Someone just reminded me of that on Twitter.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That horrendous fucking ABC.  You went on a huge rant on that because you wrote so much to the screen.  It's so insulting.  Yes.  That there's such fucking promotion whores that they sacrificed their product to promote the next thing.  It's fucking enraging.  Well, some podcast, I don't know, the one I do, I've filmed some stuff in front of the green screen 
[00:29:30]  and then shrunk it down, not as much as it should be, and I have it fly into the side of the screen.  And it's me folding my arms and nodding like these horrible reality shows on true TV.  And it's so intrusive.  And it's a big thing.  Please watch.  And it's just me pointing at the camera, folding my arms.  And I don't even acknowledge it.  It's just so intrusive.  And it's all over the place.  It's running rampant on television.  But how about, look, you got me.  I want to watch this show.  Yeah.  I'm here. 
[00:30:00]  How about we start with this show?  I'm here.  You got me.  I'm here.  My next one is going to be like a full size of me just driving through the screen in a car.  Dude, that's hilarious.  Yeah, because it's happening.  With sound that you can't hear the dialogue because the sound's coming up.  Yeah, then they put the sound on.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Let's play this.  I know he was trying to make a statement, but this was pure comedy for me when I saw this.  Comedy.  What's his name?  Congressman.  They're just saying Congressman Wears. 
[00:30:30]  Congressman Sheckler.  Lawmaker chastised for wearing hoodie in Congress.  This made me laugh, man.  That resulted in the murder of Trayvon Martin.  Boba.  Is repeated in the streets of our nation.  I applaud the young people all across the land who are making a statement about hoodies, 
[00:31:00]  about the real hoodies.  What's wrong with his voice?  He's 200 years old.  He's very old.  Could you pause for a second?  It sounds like he's missing his upper teeth.  Yeah.  Not his lower, his upper.  Let me tell you something about this guy.  Yeah.  This guy knows what racism is.  This guy has been through some shit.  He has seen some things.  That guy has seen some real fucking racism.  Guaranteed.  What did Chris Rock say?  Who was the older guy that didn't like...  Jeremiah Wright is 66 or whatever, and he doesn't like black people. 
[00:31:30]  And Chris Rock says something about nobody's 66 likes white people.  Oh, yeah.  White people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He watched his whole third grade class was hung or something.  He said some really funny line that kind of puts you into perspective.  Like, yeah, all right.  I had a mix.  Yeah.  He also had that one where he talks about some old guy, whether it was a relative or not,  I'm not sure.  But he'd be all pleasant to white people.  It's like, good morning.  Yeah, good morning.  Good morning.  And then as he walks away, he'd be like, crack ass, crack up.  Motherfucking crack ass, crack up.  Crack up, crack, crack up.  All right, let's do this. 
[00:32:00]  So he slowly takes off his jacket.  He is an old guy.  And he tries to stay on script.  Go ahead.  On our laws, wearing official or quasi-official clothes.  Wait, pause.  You could see what he was...  I want to break this down.  He wasn't sure if he should take his glasses off.  You see that move?  Yeah, yeah.  He really was like, I want my glasses.  He put his hands up to his glasses, put his hands back down, put them back up again.  He's like, he's not sure.  And then he goes, oh, wait, no, I've got to take off my suit jacket first.  Did you see him fumbling with the jacket? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah, he really is fumbling.  And he has one of the most non-threatening hoodies I've ever seen.  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  Soul filing has to stop, Mr. Speaker.  Just because someone wears a hoodie does not make them a hula.  A hula.  A hula.  The Bible teaches us...  Oh, it's upside down.  The Bible says, sir, in the book of Micah 668, these words, he has shown you, oh, man, 
[00:33:00]  what is good, what does the Lord require of you, but to do justly and to love mercy and  to walk humbly with your God.  And in the New Testament, in the New Testament, in Luke 4, 418-20, teaching us these words.  That's right.  The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has unmerited me, to proclaim the good news 
[00:33:30]  to the Lord is upon me, to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and the recovery of the saints of the black.  In person.  Asshole.  Asshole.  Okay, okay.  Save it for the field.  It's time to run.  Please listen.  You're not being fair.  May God bless the Lord.  This isn't fair.  Okay.  His family.  The member is no longer recognized. 
[00:34:00]  It's a little joke.  We live in a joke world.  Oh, boy.  My God.  I mean, good for the guy, you know, standing up for what he believes.  That was a circus, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I like how the gavel got louder and louder.  At first, it was just, oh, the chair suspends.  The speaker is a, bam, bam.  Got the big gavel out.  Mm-hmm.  Man.  Yeah, that was, he was wearing a little hoodie.  A little gray hoodie.  Looked like he was just going out, because he was a little chilly. 
[00:34:30]  It didn't look threatening or menacing at all.  No, not at all.  The hoodie is kind of, you know, synonymous with, like, convenience store robberies and whatnot.  I watch a lot of those caught-on-camera shows, you know.  Well, I mean, if you want to go out and not be recognized, you put your hood up.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you just fucking.  You put it up to be, you know, you put it up to be not recognized before you put it up because you're a little cold. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  The speaker is Bobby Rush.  He used to be a Black Panther.  Bobby?  Thank you, Mark, in Chicago.  That guy was a Black Panther?  Oh, is that who that was?  Oh, Bobby Rush.  No, but he was an ex-Panther.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard of him, actually.  You've heard of Bobby Rush?  Yeah.  I didn't know that was him.  Oh, old Panther.  Jesus.  He's just an old Panther.  Poor old guy.  I don't mind.  Yeah, he's, you know, he probably saw a lot during his youth. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I want to know what shenanigans he was involved in, though.  He's a congressman, and I don't know if he was involved in any of those, you know, terrorist events of blowing up police cars and police stations and government buildings and shootings and whatnot.  Actually, I don't want to know.  Actually, I don't care.  I sound like an activist, but I'm a laziness guy, more so.  This congressman was the same guy that thought if you put too many soldiers on Guam, it would flip over.  No fucking way. 
[00:36:00]  That's him?  I remember that.  Oh, God.  Can you find that clip?  Find that clip.  Name that tune.  He thought that if you put too many people on the island of Guam, it would flip over.  It would flip over.  Or capsize.  Yeah, because, you know, islands float in the water.  It's not the same guy?  No.  Fuck.  Ah, see.  Ah, see.  Who's that?  Hank Johnson.  We're racist.  Because they all look alike, right?  Well, no, but that guy has gray hair. 
[00:36:30]  Let's play this.  This is a different guy.  This is an island that, at its widest level, is, what, 12 miles from shore to shore?  And at its smallest level, or smallest location, it's seven miles between one shore and the other. 
[00:37:00]  Holy fuck.  Is that correct?  I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.  Very small island.  Some military guys.  Yeah, that guy has, like, hash marks up his fucking sleeves to his elbows.  This guy is fucking military.  This guy is, and this black dude, is he a black dude, or what, it's hard to tell.  He's a black dude.  He looks like a pencil pusher.  He looks like a pencil pusher.  Well, you know, keep in mind, these guys are representing us down there in Washington. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Thank God.  Oh, my God.  And there's a lot of these dummies down there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a small fucking island.  We get it.  All right, continue.  I remember this clip.  This one is hilarious.  Miles, if I recall, long.  So 24 miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island, and about  20, about 12 miles wide on the widest part of the island. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Spit it out.  I don't know how many square miles that is.  Do you happen to know?  We've got a week to figure it out.  I don't have that figure with me, sir.  I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like.  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over  and capsize. 
[00:38:30]  We don't anticipate that.  Now, how is that fucking idiot in office?  That is un-fucking-believable.  He's not kidding.  No.  Does he think islands just kind of float?  Yeah, islands float around.  Does he wonder why they don't move anywhere?  The top of a mountain, you dope.  Everyone knows you have to push the big wheel in order to move the island, right? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, very good.  We all know that.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  This was before Lost.  Where's Lapidus?  Back up a little bit, because I've got to see what this dude, how he reacts to this.  Oh, my dear sweet Lord.  Jesus Christ.  Can you go back to the part where he says it'll tip over?  I've got to hear that again.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's actually showing with his hands the tipping.  He's tipping over, and he's moving his hands like a capsizing motion.  We're just playing this today.  This isn't the same guy that put the hoodie on yesterday down there. 
[00:39:30]  The whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.  We don't anticipate that.  The Guam population, I think, currently about 175,000, and again, with 8,000 Marines and  their families, it's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population. 
[00:40:00]  There are two words in this guy's head, and one of them is dumb.  The whole time he's talking.  Why wouldn't you just openly laugh at the guy?  I know.  Why do they have to always keep it on the up and up?  He is fucking military.  That motherfucker is on.  But what he should have done was said, excuse me, sir, I just want to make sure I understood.  Did you say the island tip over?  Yeah, yeah.  I just kind of reiterate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow. 
[00:40:30]  Unfuck believable.  Yeah.  Let's hear the rest of that.  So, things like the environment, the sensitive areas of the environment, coral reefs and those  kinds of things, and I know that, you know, lots of people don't like to think about that.  Mermaids.  You know, we didn't think about global warming.  King Neptune.  And now we do have to think about it, and so I'm concerned from an environmental standpoint 
[00:41:00]  whether or not Guam is the best place to do this relocation, but it's actually the only  place.  Do you see Dava with bubbles in my fish tank?  This is the best place.  This is the farthest west U.S. territory that we own, and, you know, this is part of our nation.  And in readdressing the forward presence and posture.  It's a mountaintop, like Jimmy said.  It's hilarious.  Guam is vital to this decision. 
[00:41:30]  It's the top of a mountain.  What a dumb motherfucker.  And how come that, like, I remember that clip making the rounds a while ago.  That was back in March of 2010.  Two years ago.  Yeah, two years ago.  And I remember it making the rounds as like a goof, but why wasn't this guy just fired  from whatever job that is that he's doing there?  He should have just been fired.  Maybe he was.  I don't know.  If you don't know basic knowledge, why are you representing people? 
[00:42:00]  Islands, uh...  Holy fuck.  They don't really capsize.  What's his name?  Hank Johnson?  Yep.  Hank Johnson had something to say about the...  Oh, you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  Hank Johnson, uh, James, what do you got on?  You could call me...  Yeah, he, um, he also was re-elected, so he's still in Congress.  He just recently, the other day, said that, uh, um, Trayvon Morton was executed while  WWB in a GC, walking while black in a gated community. 
[00:42:30]  So much for, uh, racial, uh, division from Congress.  More importantly, he was re-elected after what he said two years ago?  Yes, he was.  What did he run against?  I would just put that on a loop, and run it as my campaign ad.  Of course!  Complete...  That's all you need.  How do you lose to this guy?  Vote for anyone but Hank Johnson.  And then just fuckin' play that loop.  It could capsize.  And he does the tilt. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, he does the universal sign of an island capsizing.  What district does he represent?  Uh, Moron...  Moronisville.  They gotta be a bunch of dummies.  He, uh, later said that it was a metaphor.  No, that's not a metaphor.  No, it's not a metaphor.  Not how he said it.  Because he literally said the island capsized.  Right.  Yeah.  Like he was saying he thinks the island...  And he was showing it with his hands.  And he's very concerned.  You know what capsize meant?  He's very concerned.  Now understand, when it does capsize, that leaves a whole nother island for people to 
[00:43:30]  populate on top.  This video became popular a week prior to his election.  And he still won.  Oh, my God.  It's like the video was completely hot.  Oh, my God.  And how do you lose to that?  That's amazing.  What district is he from?  Well, we got a guy that might have some knowledge on that, Jim Newton.  Ah!  Playing Carolines this weekend, starting tonight.  Kevin in Atlanta, what's up?  Hello.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  This is a very colorful district.  It's called the 4th District. 
[00:44:00]  It's DeKalb County down here in Atlanta.  You might remember the person he defeated, one Cynthia McKinney.  Oh, shit.  Oh, is she a fucking dopey cunt?  Another idiot.  Which one was she again?  Who complained because her hairstyle was different.  The guy didn't recognize her and she never pinned on.  She was a twat.  Oh, yeah.  She got all fucking nasty.  Oh, my glad she lost.  Yeah.  And listen, and before Cynthia McKinney, it was her father, Billy McKinney, who's the  only state representative to pull out a knife on the floor.  What fucking clown? 
[00:44:30]  I'm starting to love politics.  That's a great district.  Yeah.  It's a horrible district.  Literal caller.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  It's an awful, awful district.  I get it.  You think it's awful?  Yeah.  I think it's awful.  Nothing about the district.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Kevin.  Oh, okay.  It's that district.  Oh, Cab County.  Yeah, yeah.  The same.  It was Cobb County, Georgia.  That's a different place.  Oh, yes.  Who was from there?  The Big Boss Man.  Big Boss Man. 
[00:45:00]  Where are we from, Cobb?  All right.  It's a good song.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  What's he doing these days?  Big Boss Man.  Is he making money out of the circuit?  I would think he's in the Independent League.  Independent?  Yeah.  Have you seen him at some of these cons that you've been to?  There's six feet of dirt on top of him.  Oh, no.  Not the Big Boss Man.  He lost the Big Boss Man when?  Hit by a car or something.  He was a relatively young guy, so an accident must have befallen him.  What happened?  He was in his late 40s. 
[00:45:30]  His heart gave out.  His heart gave out, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, at least we got Kamala still wrestling, so that's good.  Yeah, Kamala.  Thank God we got Kamala still.  He's alive.  All right.  That's good.  Not wrestling.  How old is he?  I'll give you that.  But he's not.  No, he's not.  Why isn't he wrestling?  Yeah.  Well, he's just got the one leg.  What?  He's got one leg, Kamala?  Yeah.  That guy.  He's 61. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  Shit, that's ancient for a wrestler.  He has one leg.  His name should be Storker instead of Kamala.  He's not a camel.  He's a storker.  We got a clip of the shape Kamala's in.  Kamala's son is speaking out today.  Yeah, he was on some radio show that would have Kamala's son on.  Oh.  And Kamala's son had this to say.  Remember, Kamala has one leg right now.  Now, we have heard some news in relation to your father who had some complications with 
[00:46:30]  the high blood pressure and the diabetes.  And, in fact, I believe it was late last year they were doing some sort of a charity for him  because he had this leg apnea.  Now, how is his condition right now?  How is your dad doing?  It was kind of funny that you would ask.  In fact, I just spoke with him about a half hour ago and told him that I would be on here  and that I would like to let the wrestling fans know that he is having complications with his other foot now. 
[00:47:00]  Wow.  And we will know Friday is when I think he said Friday we will know whether or not they'll have to take his other foot off.  Is this sort of a profit or an organization or a fund that you guys have started to help out Kamala?  Actually, not really.  I personally have ran a tribute show or a benefit show for him. 
[00:47:30]  You can feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  You got a picture with Kamala.  And while he could still stand up.  Oh, shit.  He had two legs in that picture?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was in his gear.  Were they looking a little ratty, the legs?  And his face is more believable and natural than dumb Sam's in that.  Oh, I know.  Sam's making like a...  What is that?  That's not my wrestling face.  That face stinks.  You do that in a lot of pictures.  Sam, if the leg was available, would you bid on it? 
[00:48:00]  Being a big wrestling fan?  I would love to have Kamala's leg.  I would prefer...  Is it out there somewhere?  I don't think his leg is up for auction, no.  That would be nice.  How about they bring it in for like WrestleMania?  Throw it up on a pole or something?  Well, one of the other wrestlers can beat somebody with it.  Right.  Oh, my God.  He's beating him with Kamala's leg.  Kamala's leg on a pole match.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And then you get to pull the leg down and yeah.  And you just beat somebody with it.  With Kamala's leg.  I would be watching wrestling again. 
[00:48:30]  And that would be good for Kamala because it's like he's almost there.  He's probably got some cash out of it, which he needs.  He doesn't have coverage.  It's not like he has a retirement plan.  Yeah.  I deliver to the district this guy is from.  Deliver?  All right.  Hold on.  You got to hear this guy.  Which guy?  The island guy?  I think the island guy.  Oh.  Because there's two...  It was Kamala.  There's two guys today we're discussing.  Robert in North Carolina.  Hey there, Bab.  Yes, sir.  Good morning, boys. 
[00:49:00]  I used to deliver an Aldi supermarket down there in that district.  And it's delivered about two or three in the morning.  We were not supposed to get out of the truck unless a guard was there, which was off-duty  cops.  I didn't know this for the first three months.  I started...  I got out of the truck to open the doors to back into the supermarket.  And I was slipping and sliding on something.  I looked down.  It's actual spent bullets, not the brass.  Because they shot bullets with rifling marks on them and everything. 
[00:49:30]  Get out of here.  Come on.  Nice.  I do not kid about this.  So one night across the street at the Kroger, there was a club next to the Kroger supermarket  and there was a running gun battle going on.  Jesus.  Yeah, but that's not the biggest problem, you know, to deal with.  There is a half mile up from the DeKalb detention facility also.  Jeez.  It sounds like a great place.  Had by all.  Sounds like somebody running SimCity for the first time.  They just don't know how to do it. 
[00:50:00]  Buildings are on fire.  You don't know how to fix it.  Crime's running rampant.  You didn't put enough police.  Cynthia McKinney, also the one that wanted them to move the Mars rover over to where the  astronauts landed so she could see the flag.  No fucking way.  Did she say that?  I was one of those rocket scientists that is elected to.  Move the Mars rover over so they could see the flag of where we landed on Mars.  Please tell me there's a clip of this. 
[00:50:30]  That's fucking classic.  Let's just play clips of politicians sounding stupid.  Of idiot politicians.  Yeah.  We pay their fucking salaries and they're dumb as dirt.  We gotta find that one.  Thank you, Robert.  That's a good one.  Certainly is.  A little enlightenment on the district there.  That's nice.  We should break.  Eat some breakfast.  Yeah.  David Tell's coming in today.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  David Tell.  Nice.  Funny motherfucker that guy is.  And I'd love to chat about this fucking cop who's been fired who is not convicted of 
[00:51:00]  rape.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck, man?  That's a crazy world, man.  I know.  It's fucking disgusting.  Crazy world.  And we got Carson Daly saying some stuff.  Carson Daly's a shock jock.  He's the latest guy that has to apologize.  What'll doodle.  Every day someone's apologizing.  Oh, my God.  Bone dry, bone dry.  We would look really stupid if we apologized for anything at this point.  Oh, I know.  Even the fake apology thing.  We would look really dumb.  We could do fake apology.  We could still do fake apology? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, we could do.  Anyone could do fake apology as long as you let everybody know you're doing fake apology.  Which we're letting you know now.  Which we've done.  For years now, we've said if we ever apologize, it will never be sincere.  But we've got to tell the people it would be a fake apology now.  Yeah, it'll be a fake apology if we ever have to apologize.  Right, because the day that we have to do the fake apology, we can't tell you that it's a fake apology.  We have to sound like, you know.  We have to sound sincere to save our asses.  But it won't be.  But it will be a fake apology.  You'll know that.  Oh, yeah.  Let's eat.  That's 866-969-1969.

[00:56:30]  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday.  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mmm, Mars.  I see here you had your first gay experience last night.  Yeah?  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I ain't a retentive.  It's so tight.  Mmm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick? 
[00:57:00]  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls this apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in my ass. 
[00:57:30]  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it, just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly.  Come on.  Alcohol.  Alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me. 
[00:58:00]  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad any time.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars, you are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars. 
[00:58:30]  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Me and O.P. are talking while the music's playing. 
[00:59:00]  And E-Rock's waving his hands like, hey, we're off.  Oh, my God.  I can hear the music.  I don't know.  Sometimes you turn it down in there so you can talk.  Oh, shut up.  How much do I owe you, stupid?  Oh, wow.  Why do you owe E-Rock money?  Sexual favors?  Yes.  And I told him I'd give him a dollar a pound. 
[00:59:30]  How much?  Oh, wait.  Oh.  Well, we did wrestling.  We can't keep doing wrestling shit on this show.  Oh, no.  We gave him a little taste before the break.  Now we've got to do more after the break.  I'll just look down here and see more Uggs.  I know.  Oh, well.  All right.  We can just move on.  Something about WrestleMania, I guess.  Hulk Hogan pinned Andre the Giant at WrestleMania 25 years ago.  What song is this?  The Hulk Hogan song.  It fucking sucks. 
[01:00:00]  You don't know this song, Jimmy?  I got something deep inside of me.  Courage is the thing that keeps us free.  I'm a real American.  Yeah, enough.  Yeah.  Every.  Wow, is he a cheese dick?  Oh, yeah.  Hulk is a cheese dick.  Was the porno that he did to this?  Was his fuck film?  Still waiting on it.  Yeah.  I am a real American. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, remember that district we were talking about before the break?  Certainly do.  Where the guy down there in Washington representing the people thinks the island of Guam was going  to tip over if they added too many people to the island?  It can capsize.  It could tilt right over.  Yeah.  And sink.  And he replaced a woman that was yelling and got in trouble trying to get into one of  the government buildings because she didn't have an ID.  Right.  And her hairstyle was different.  Right.  So, of course, she claimed racism.  Of course. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Everyone's racist.  Sheila.  No?  She's Cynthia McKinney.  Cynthia McKinney.  Yeah.  Well, that district is more info coming in from Leonard in Georgia.  Yeah.  It's all about Georgia today on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Leonard?  Hey, how are you?  How are you?  Listen, all about DeKalb County.  The former sheriff who's currently serving a life sentence because when he was running,  he decided the best political way is to murder his opponent.  I'm not lying. 
[01:01:30]  Look it up.  I promise you.  So, the former sheriff murdered his opponent.  Yeah.  A couple of years ago, I'm not 100% on the details, but a couple of years ago, him and  a couple of deputies got together, staked out the guy's house, ended up murdering him,  and he's on television, and we're going to find out who did this horrendous crime.  Wow.  He did that horrendous crime.  So, that's your wonderful Harlem of the South, DeKalb County. 
[01:02:00]  Sounds cool.  Thank you, man.  That's great, Leonard.  Thank you.  God, this district is amazing.  That's a fun district.  Sure is.  Fun.  Sure is.  Carson Daly.  Carson Daly.  Getting involved in Shock Jockery.  Shock Jockery, sure.  Shock Jockery is going on there.  But the problem is he is the host of The Voice, a show that's doing very well.  Yes.  Who is Carson? 
[01:02:30]  Carson Daly.  And you can't say anything politically incorrect when you have a gig like that.  No fucking way.  Well, just like us, he was talking about the JetBlue pilot.  JetBlue.  And he had this to say.  Turns out, on this particular flight, most of the people were on their way to some sort  of security conference in Las Vegas.  It was a group of very large men on that plane.  So there's a bunch of dudes and well-trained dudes.  What are the odds of that?  Thank God, right?  Thank God.  If that were me, I mean, my luck, it would be like, this is the flight going to Pride  in San Francisco. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, that would be my calling.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We're headed down to Vegas for the floral convention.  Can we get a little help up here with the pilot?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I might break my nails.  No, thank you.  Handle it.  He had to say he was sorry for that?  For that.  Don't say sorry, Carson.  What the fuck?  Because another example of a guy just trying to entertain his audience.  Wow.  Like it or not.  This country fucking stinks.  It's all about the apology these days.  Americans are absolute fucking babies. 
[01:03:30]  We really are.  What?  Babies.  Are we, though?  Because when I walk around, I don't run into these people that are offended.  Where are they?  Are they hiding?  They don't stand up.  They fucking just sit there and let people swing by the neck until it's them.  Fuck them.  Right.  They all allow it.  We all allow it.  I mean, we speak up, but the average person doesn't.  They don't write in.  They don't write about it on Twitter.  I think they don't know what to do.  I think it's that mentality with the anthill like we like to go to.  You kick that anthill and you don't know how to organize.  Yeah.  Everyone's kind of pissed off. 
[01:04:00]  Those ants are pissed off at first.  They don't know what to do first.  Right?  Yeah.  But eventually the ants do figure it out and they build a new anthill.  Yes.  I don't know.  Because I don't see these people when I'm walking around and doing my shit.  They're such a small minority.  He apologized before anyone even said anything, I think.  Right?  Did somebody get a little pissy with him?  I don't think so.  I think he was just like, uh-oh.  It just started, the story just started breaking.  And he's like, did Glad get mad? 
[01:04:30]  Hope I don't get in big trouble for doing this voice on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  How come every time I watch a show where there's a gay guy, he does sound like that?  Because it's only okay to stereotype if you're from that group or if you're painting a group  in a light that they find acceptable, then the stereotype is true.  But if you're making fun of or painting them in a negative light, then the stereotype is  not true.  That's the rule.  Oh, okay.  That's just stupid.  Yes, it is.  I really know the rules now. 
[01:05:00]  Remember yesterday we were talking about schools and how they're politically correct?  Yes.  We've been doing this break for years at this point.  My Twitter fucking exploded.  Everyone's outraged out there.  Yeah, a little bit.  But everyone's outraged.  There are parents out there going, it's all bullshit.  But just like we were just talking about, they don't know what to do about it.  They don't know how to complain.  They don't know if complaining would even make a difference.  No.  But a million examples were coming in yesterday.  Yeah, well, we did the story yesterday about how the New York City school system, on their 
[01:05:30]  tests, they've eliminated certain words that they would think would be offensive to some  of the students because of their socioeconomic position and other things about their religions.  So things like dinosaur, you will not see on New York's standardized tests because some  people believe in creationism.  Right.  And you won't see things like pools referenced on tests or computers, home computers, because  some people might be too impoverished. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, by the way, poverty.  You can't use that either.  Right.  Slavery.  Terrorism's too scary.  There's a shitload of things that they won't allow on tests anymore.  And I think a couple more came out yesterday.  Do you have the article, the updated article, Sam?  Oh, a couple more came out?  I think television was added to that list.  Television?  Everyone's got TV.  You would assume.  That noise.  What, like flat screen TV maybe?  I don't know.  Maybe good TV?  Jimmy wasn't here for this, but it's unbelievable. 
[01:06:30]  It's not, you can't say Easter Bunny.  You have to say Spring Bunny.  You can't say...  You have to say Spring Bunny?  They don't even say Easter eggs.  They have to say Spring...  Holiday eggs?  Spring eggs.  Spring...  Nope.  Spring spheres.  Spring spheres?  What about the spring spheres?  Spring spheres.  Instead of...  They don't even say eggs.  I saw Bruce Spring spheres at the Apollo.  Whoa!  I got the fucking pistol.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Someone wrote that they don't build snowmen anymore.  They build snow buddies. 
[01:07:00]  Snow buddies.  Snow buddies.  Sounds like a rest stop.  Fucking code word.  Or snow buddies.  Blow buddies.  It sounds like this entire...  I couldn't think of a group or company or staff.  I was going to say a bunch of nobodies, but I failed.  Did you put tits on your snowman when you were growing up?  No.  Yeah, I didn't either.  I did.  Would you?  And I put a little lump between the chin and chest under the...  Jesus.  I gave it an apple.  Big cock.  Talked.  I gave it a snow apple. 
[01:07:30]  A little...  Chilly Adams.  But it's now snow buddy.  Yeah.  Someone on Fox News yesterday was...  Talked about the story?  Yeah, and brought up a good point.  Used to go on field trips, and I remember this.  Field trips to the Museum of Natural History.  And we used to see dinosaur bones and fossils and things like that, and the history of the  earth.  Right.  And things like that.  I guess, what?  They're not going to do that?  They can't do that anymore?  Because you have to explain where that came from, and it's contrary to some of their religious 
[01:08:00]  beliefs.  So you just don't take kids to that museum?  So what?  You just black out all this shit?  Yeah, you just make like it doesn't exist.  Well, how about you still bring them, and they go, but some dummies out there think  this is...  Some dummies, yeah.  Some dummies think that this stuff's only a couple thousand years old.  They really are assholes.  And that's how I would teach.  Some dummies think.  Yeah.  These create...  I don't care if you're a creationist, but to think the earth's only 5,000 years old,  you're a fucking asshole.  You're an absolute asshole.  All the evidence points to the fact that it is much older. 
[01:08:30]  It's infuriating.  Yeah, they just...  Anything to defend their faith, anything to defend what they believe, and nobody...  We are talking to people right now that believe that shit.  Well, they're dumb.  Sorry if you're listening.  You're dumb.  My brother wrote, and I thought he was just being a dick or something.  He texted during that discussion yesterday.  I thought we did this on the air, but it turns out we didn't.  He wrote, kids...  And then I tweeted this yesterday, but for the people that don't follow me on Twitter,  he wrote, kids can't sit Indian style anymore. 
[01:09:00]  No, right.  Cross-legged.  It's called crisscross applesauce.  So a teacher will go, okay, everyone, crisscross applesauce.  What?  Yeah.  Crisscross.  But didn't Indians...  Crisscross applesauce.  Didn't Indians sit that way?  Indian style.  Yeah.  Everyone sit down Indian style.  Voss had the funniest joke.  Oh, Voss's joke is great.  What did he say?  He told me to sit Indian style, so I got a bottle of whiskey and laid on the curb.  Which is very funny.  That's great.  But, uh, yeah, yeah, you can't say sit Indian style. 
[01:09:30]  Crisscross applesauce.  Why?  Why is that offensive?  Like, break it down.  Why would people find that offensive?  For real.  Because you're equating something with an ethnicity, and Indians would say, we're tired of being  cartooned.  They're the only group I side with on this stuff, because they're still being cartooned in  the NFL and fucking on, uh, in baseball.  Right.  Like, they're still, like, they said things like, uh, redskins.  Why is redskins? 
[01:10:00]  It was a pile of, that was a term used for a pile of Indian bodies.  How many redskins you got?  In a cart.  So they find that offensive.  And, uh, like, squaw.  Like, they, I heard a bunch of them explaining why these were offensive, and it actually made  sense.  Like, yeah, if you had that.  You know what?  Tough shit.  Ah.  I say we continue with that, and we bring everything else back.  But you can't do it with Jews or blacks, and just because political correctness stinks  doesn't mean that it's never wrong.  But there's a certain thing that, and just because, I think that's it, though. 
[01:10:30]  Just because it's one nationality doesn't mean that all nationalities have to adhere to  something.  It's like, it's just weird that it's not literal.  When you say, you know, the Washington Redskins, it's not a, like, hey, let's name our team  after, you know, Redskins.  It's, it's just sort of become a thing.  When you sit Indian style, you're not thinking, like, oh, let me cross my legs and sit like  a savage in the dirt.  You're thinking, oh, cross legs.  It's just become a thing that's said, you know? 
[01:11:00]  But it is kind of like, in that case, it's almost like if you said, all right, we're going  to call a team the Slaves, or we're going to call a team the Jigs, and you had a black  face on it.  Not really, not really, because it, that, that's been put in a whole nother category  of offensive, let's say.  I think, I think American Indians, they have a small group of people that are pissed off  at this just to make a noise.  I don't think a lot of people are offended by the fact that, you know, they do the tomahawk 
[01:11:30]  chop in Atlanta.  Yeah, I know.  You know?  You don't think that deeply when, when this stuff is around you.  Yeah, yeah.  But if people stood up and started going, like, Allah Akbar, or started to stand up  and doing vah vah, or doing some Jewish thing, or whatever, a Christian thing, people would  object to it.  People wouldn't say, hey, that's fine.  People would object to it, because it would bother them.  The Indians are the only ones that get that shit, and I kind of, I just, I guess after  hearing them explain themselves, they were being rational, they weren't being fucking 
[01:12:00]  knee-jerk reactionary.  Yeah.  They were just like, look, this is why.  Wounded knee-jerk reactionary.  Oh, it's a 70s joke.  They allowed it to be accepted a long time ago, though.  They probably had no, no power to do anything at that point.  Yeah, but the other groups, how do they have power?  Um, I don't know.  Way back in the day, we weren't going to name a team, you know, the New York slaves or  anything.  I don't think American Indians have enough of a lobby that, that they make an impact. 
[01:12:30]  And the fact that they are so isolated and so separate from our society with the reservation  system and their own law enforcement and their own, they really have done their own  thing, you know?  They got different rules.  Yeah, different rules.  And a lot of those rules kind of rock.  So I don't think...  They kind of rock if you think about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you love to own a casino?  Um, well, that would be nice.  A nice family casino somewhere in the middle of the woods?  Make a lot of money.  How great would that be?  I was watching a show on, uh, the TV, I guess, uh, I'm not sure which tribe it is. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, what is it?  But they have, it's like cops on a reservation, you know?  Yeah.  So they were, uh, and most of it was domestic violence and drunks.  It's just, it's a horrible fucking situation they got going.  Uh, the American Indian.  Uh, let's say hi to Joe on Long Island.  He's saying I'm a creationist.  I guess that makes me an asshole, but I can argue my point.  What's up, Joe?  How are you, buddy?  Hi, Joe.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you doing? 
[01:13:30]  Hi, Joe.  Hi, Joe.  How old is the Earth?  How old is the Earth?  You know what?  I'm a bit of a agnostic on that point, and I'll tell you why.  They use carbon-14 dating to date the various strats when they, when they do their excavations.  Okay?  Yes.  Carbon-14 dating goes under the assumption that carbon, uh, decays at a set rate.  Yes, a half-life.  Yes, a half-life, but it has to be at a set rate.  A certain number of years each, uh, a certain number of atoms decays. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  The problem is, is that we've only been observing that for a certain, for a shorter period of time.  Now, what if carbon doesn't, uh, or hasn't always decayed at the same rate?  What if it, at some point, or there, or there's some mass effect earlier in the Earth's creation that caused carbon to decay at a factory?  All right.  You know what?  Younger?  Maybe.  Okay.  But I, I don't know.  I'm not a scientist, but I will say.  Really?  Nor am I.  I, I still, even if... 
[01:14:30]  I would like it better if you'd call me an asshole, Jim.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  No, but I'm, I'm calling people an asshole who, who completely, being a creationist, I don't think if you believe that God created the Earth, I don't think you're an asshole.  Oh, I 100% do.  I think people are assholes when they think that 5,000 years is a more reasonable guess than 4.5 billion.  Like, even if the carbon thing is off, it's not off by 4.5 billion.  You look around, because I look at how science has made mistakes, but I look at the way religion has handled things, and has always been the last one to the fucking party. 
[01:15:00]  When science finally puts so much out there that they just look antiquated and laughable, then they show up.  I agree with you 100% in that regard, but I do take it to this extreme.  Have you ever thought of science as being someone of its own religion?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Absolutely.  You take what these scientists say, unknown people to you, who, by the way, have an agenda. 
[01:15:30]  They have to get grant money.  They have to fund their research somehow.  You can't, you can't get a grant by saying God did it.  Look, look, I understand what you're saying, and some, a lot of science, hold on two seconds, hold on two seconds.  A lot of science is partially faith-based, because it's a lot of theory, but it's backed up by so much evidence that that final step of leap of faith that you need to take is not that difficult.  Now, with pure, like, Catholicism, it's only faith-based. 
[01:16:00]  You really need to take that leap of faith without any evidence whatsoever.  And like Jimmy said, once science comes up with so much evidence, I didn't say science is faith-based.  I said part of it is that final little step where you don't have the actual thing in front of you, but there's so much evidence to prove that it did exist.  You need to take that final step.  That's what I said, idiot.  Not you, idiot.  Idiot on Palpatine. 
[01:16:30]  But now religion, like I said...  100%.  Wait now, wait now.  Okay.  Okay, your point, sir.  Faith can be based in observable science.  For example, the creation of the universe.  Yeah.  Big Bang Theory, which, by the way, is very, very well received in the scientific community, jives perfectly with the biblical creation.  Not 5,000 years ago, sir.  No, no, no, but 5,000 years ago.  Now, the Bible says a day to the Lord is like 1,000 years. 
[01:17:00]  So who's to say, first of all, time also, not just space, but time was created.  It's like a meeting here.  But you...  No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Now, look at the creation of the universe and ask any scientist, anyone, and they will tell you that the perfectly designed numbers of the universe,  from the temperature of the universe at the moment of creation, to the mass, to the gravitational forces, to the strength in the atom that exists in all of us. 
[01:17:30]  All of these numbers are so incredibly fine-tuned that in order for that to happen by chance, it would have to...  The odds of it are, I think, 1 in 10 to 40th power.  Right.  Now, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me answer that.  Let me answer that for two seconds.  Hold on, hold on.  Now, see, understand this, though.  If it didn't happen that way, we would not be here, to argue the point.  So the mere fact that we're here dictates that it did happen, so the odds matter for nothing. 
[01:18:00]  Like, if odds are so astronomical that it probably wouldn't happen, well, if it didn't, we wouldn't be here to argue it.  So the only way we're here is the fact that it happened.  But how does that change the fact that the chances of it happening were so slim that there's probably a reason it happened?  And the chances of it happening by just pure chance, by pure luck, is so astronomical, doesn't it make you think, hey, there's a reason this was all created? 
[01:18:30]  And there has to be a mind behind that creation.  No, it doesn't, sir.  No, it doesn't mean that there has to be.  And so here's why I disagree in a way, too, because when you look at over the years, the way science is handled and the way religion is handled, look at the penalties for disagreeing with religion have been horrendous penalties.  Yeah, absolutely.  Science tests and retests and tests and retests, and there is no penalty. 
[01:19:00]  So so many people have just gone under religious doctrine because they were forced to.  Stephen Hawking theorized black holes, and people thought he was dominant, didn't exist, and then eventually it was proven.  But you're allowed to do that in science, whereas up until recently in religion, there was very, very harsh penalties for disagreeing.  So the more I learn scientifically, the less respect I have for religion, and the more I find it to be just nonsense.  I agree and I disagree, but what about global warming, Jim?  I mean, if you disagree with global warming, as a scientist, you could test and retest. 
[01:19:30]  They've shown that the temperatures are not changing.  There's been global warming.  There's been global cooling.  But unless you're in that clique of scientists that are global warming theorists, you get penalized.  Yeah, but not by being turned upside down and sawed through the genitals, sir.  Jesus Christ.  I hope to ram up your ass, exactly.  Well, then you can't compare the two.  If you think that a little magical guy, like I could see if the Earth was only here by itself, but religious people thought that the Earth was the center of the universe. 
[01:20:00]  No, asshole, it's not.  Okay, now we acknowledge it's not.  Who taught you?  Science.  Hey, the sun revolves around us.  No, assholes, it doesn't.  Who taught you?  Science.  Yeah.  Every single thing that religion gives into, it is because science has put so much evidence in their fucking faces that they finally could not resist without looking utterly ridiculous.  They have resisted every single scientific advancement. 
[01:20:30]  And dinosaurs, remember when they were a big hoax?  And I'm not yelling at you, sir.  I'm yelling about this.  Not at you, sir.  But do you remember when they were just a big hoax and they were put there to advance the theories of science?  Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember dinosaurs ever.  Absolutely.  That was that.  I've always known of dinosaurs.  No, no, no.  Religious people explain them by that.  Yeah, that was the official line of religion was the fact that it was just made up, that dinosaurs never really existed at all. 
[01:21:00]  And now they're saying 5,000 years ago.  And you bring up carbon dating as the only way they're telling the dates.  They're not.  All right, hold on.  We got Kevin that wants to argue the carbon 14 thing with you because he thinks you're way off.  So we got Kevin in Jersey and, of course, Joe still on the line from Long Island.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Yeah, the guy dismisses the whole age of the universe thing.  I mean, well, maybe carbon, maybe half-life changed over time.  But everything we've observed when we look through telescopes at stars at their state where they were, well, most people believe, billions of years ago. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  The strong and weak nuclear forces haven't changed by a part that we can measure over billions of light years or billions of years.  And he's going to throw out the whole – he is an asshole because he says you're an asshole if you believe the Earth is 5,000 years old.  Well, he gets on and says, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but here's why maybe it isn't.  And then he just throws out basic tenets, repeatedly confirmed tenets of science.  Repeatedly confirmed tenets of science like so many other theories that have been thrown out. 
[01:22:00]  Like, for example, the steady state theory of the universe that was widely accepted until the Big Bang Theory and the Red Ship was discovered in the 1960s.  So for me to be agnostic, for me to say, you know, I don't really know, you're probably right, the universe probably is millions or billions of years old.  You're probably right, but I'm not willing to slam the door on the possibility that, hey, when the universe was created, did it expand at a faster rate than it's expanding now? 
[01:22:30]  Just like if you throw a ball, does it accelerate? Does it start slowing down the minute it leaves your hand? Yes.  So is that possible?  I'm very excited.  Let me fucking talk.  Wow.  Universe.  Little guy, you're angry in Jersey.  No, but so you are kind of talking over the Jersey Kevin.  Let Jersey Kevin talk.  Believe me, Jersey Kevin's a creep, too, but we'd like to hear him.  I'm a creep, but the state theory of the universe changed with more refined observation, with better instruments. 
[01:23:00]  The carbon dating and the measurement of the weak and strong nuclear forces have only gotten more precise and more confirmed.  So, you know, you can throw that out with anything.  And the reason is that global warming, the earlier example, where there's such orthodoxy in science is only because it's been politicized by assholes,  not because of any difference, not because of a change in the scientific method or measurement or science.  And can I jump in with just a quick point?  Like when you look at, you know, I'm known as the neutrino kid because I talk a lot about them. 
[01:23:30]  But they recently had a test where they thought, wow, is Einstein wrong?  Is something that can move faster than the speed of light?  And then this basic belief in physics, which would have changed everything if it was wrong or it would have changed a lot.  They put the data out there and they said, go ahead, do what you got to do with it.  See if it's wrong.  And everybody went after it and tested it.  And then they realized that there was something with one of the cables, I think.  But that's how science tends to handle these things is everybody looks at it and tests it and retests it before it just becomes accepted as basic fact. 
[01:24:00]  Amen.  There's absolutely, you're comparing, though, scientific theory, which is wonderful.  And I believe God gave us science to explore his creation.  I'm sure he did.  I believe he gave us a mind.  I'm sure he did.  To explore these things.  Of course.  Why wouldn't he?  God blinded me with science.  Science.  Yeah, can we play a little blinding me?  God probably did that to me.  He threw Pluto out there for what reason?  B-Rock should have had that right on there. 
[01:24:30]  Fucking.  No shit, man.  Thomas Dolby, bitch.  But he had that.  Thomas Dolby, bitch.  But he had that dumb golden song yesterday.  Bam, bam, bam.  Bam, bam, bam.  Bam.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I hated that song.  One of my submarines is missing.  The following.  Now see, God invented science.  Woo!  La, da, da, da, da, da.  The Big Bang was 5,000 years ago. 
[01:25:00]  Yes.  Dinosaurs wore Nikes.  That's true.  Christ rode a dinosaur.  He was yelling, giddy up.  Him and Mary Magdalene rode around the fucking Jerusalem.  Hey, Joe, we're good?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  By the way, greatest mashed potatoes I ever had was at FH Riley's.  Oh, you go to my brother's restaurant?  God made those mashed potatoes.  You know what?  Then I got to go with this guy's theory. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Right out of the way.  I am saying the Earth is 5,000 years old, and I can't lose a customer right now.  Yeah, you might as well.  Likes the bananas.  The bananas.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you, guys.  Bye, guys.  Try the mac and cheese next time.  My brother doesn't even need my help anymore.  That guy's rocking with his dumb restaurant.  And I mean dumb in a good way.  In a good way.  Science!  In a good way, Brett.  In a good way.  So are lions!  More importantly, Sam is wearing a different hat today. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  We're keeping track of Sam and his hats because yesterday he was wearing a San Diego Padres hat.  What is this one?  Let me see.  Oh, it's the first two letters of what he is.  CR.  He's a creep.  Or a crud.  Oh, look who fucking ran in.  Oh.  Is the Colorado Rockies your team?  Yeah, it's a team I've been looking at through spring training.  No, it's not.  No, Kenny's right. 
[01:26:30]  I was being sarcastic.  I don't watch baseball.  So stop wearing the hats.  I like hats.  So go get a hat of something you believe in.  No, I wear it because I like the way it looks.  I don't get that.  I'd like a suit, please, in 400 extra large, puss-colored.  I know.  It's the worst color.  What the fuck is that?  That's phlegm.  That's the color phlegm.  Phlegm.  That's horrible.  Why, Kenny?  What is the official color?  Do they have something in bile?  Why don't you throw a little color into your wardrobe? 
[01:27:00]  Real colors.  They don't have very many things when you have to shop at the freak store.  Which one?  Self-deprecation.  But listen, let's not focus on me.  Sam's falling apart.  We've got to figure out the underlying problem.  He's not falling apart at all that.  He's gay and he's of two different races.  Overbearing, coddling mother.  Yes, who saves everything.  A hoarder mom.  A fucking handlebar mustachioed father.  Mustachioed. 
[01:27:30]  Fucking drinks buttermilk.  Exactly.  Eat fucking anchovies.  Squeezing his cock like it's a fucking thing of cookie dough to get his urine out for 20 years.  A house full of fucking memorabilia from a nobody.  What does that have to do with the hats?  Excuse me, Sam, I'm talking.  He must be rebelling because he used to be such a sweet boy.  What?  He must be rebelling now.  Oh.  Because look how he's dressing.  Motown t-shirt.  Yeah, what are you doing?  The backwards hat.  The hoodie.  The hoodie.  Are you Trayvon?  I've had this hoodie for years. 
[01:28:00]  I know what's going on.  What's going on?  It's getting close to being hired by Shade 45.  Oh.  That hoop kid got to you, huh?  No.  My mom bought this shirt at an airport.  But why the Colorado Rockies?  That's a black thing.  Because I like purple and black.  White guys, for the most part, don't wear a hat just because it looks good on them.  They support the team.  So you think Sam's looking for Shade 45 to hire him, too?  Oh, fuck yeah.  He wants to be able to go to their events.  Yo, what's up, Sammy R in the house?  See, when we were growing up, of course, children of the 80s right here.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  I don't remember anyone wearing a hat that wasn't from the team they support. 
[01:28:30]  Well, maybe they didn't.  That's a new thing.  Might have to be a new thing, then.  We've got to evolve with the times.  But I'm just wearing a hat.  But it's not a new thing for white people.  Maybe white people need to step up their game a little bit.  Oh, shit.  Race war in the studio.  What black people do?  Some white people do what...  With the hat thing, I mean.  White people do a lot of it.  Yeah, you can.  Like, it's a hat.  It's an article of clothing.  You just wear it because you like the way it looks.  No.  Yeah?  It doesn't look good on you. 
[01:29:00]  God, I'm going to take fashion advice from you.  See, I got a P6 hat.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  With a bullseye.  Yeah.  Because that's what it's into.  I go there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, why advertise it?  Just because?  Name one Colorado Rocky.  Just one.  Yeah.  So that's the Stallone?  Oh, God.  Adrian.  Name one.  I couldn't begin to think that.  Name one San Diego Padre.  Roland hit me off. 
[01:29:30]  Garth Brooks trained with them for some time.  San Diego Padre, Father Mulcahy.  He does the clap and the pistol shoot hands now.  Okay, Padre.  The Padres won the pennant in 1984.  Yeah?  That's what one of the sports guys told me yesterday.  Who cares?  It was news to me.  Of course it was.  Yeah, and they're priests.  Ah.  What?  It's very funny.  Padres.  Oh, Padres.  Yeah.  It's very good.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I just got a tweet from someone.  She said, the Baptists still believe dinosaurs were put there to test their faith. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Is that true?  Do they really believe that or is that not true?  It's not only they believe it, it is true, too, that dinosaurs were put there to test  their faith.  One thing I did like from Joe on Long Island was the fact that he said, you know...  Potatoes?  Organized religion.  Oh.  What do you call it?  Bullshit or crazy or whatever.  Hopefully not in that language.  I like disorganized religion.  People running around.  Sure.  Sure.  I am.  All right.  Jimmy.  I just hear Jimmy snort a little bit like... 
[01:30:30]  That's all right.  I love that, though.  Oh, we'll break.  I just toss him out there.  I'm just running around in circles or something.  Yeah.  God, the devil, heaven, hell.  Do you understand?  Finally, Mr. Harding.  Oh, fuck.  Remember that?  I'm not talking about my wife.  I'm talking about my life.  God, the devil, hell, heaven.  I love when Mr. Harding just gets fed up with everybody's malarkey.  Oh, yeah.  Jim's wearing a Los Angeles sweatshirt.  That's right. 
[01:31:00]  Because he goes to Los Angeles a lot.  That's right.  See how that works?  For city.  I bought this in an airport.  I go to Detroit.  There's a connection there.  Mother didn't buy this.  I bought it.  I've got family in Detroit, so can I wear the Motown shirt then?  Of course you do.  Yeah, but how come the A.H.O. got dropped off it?  It's not homo-town.  What?  No, I went Motown.  Stop pointing at me, Chip.  Did you hear Chip on the after show yesterday?  Of course I did.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't listen.  Yeah, he kept talking about Troy's dick. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, I forgot.  Oh, right.  I think Chip is a homosexual.  Of course not.  I think he is.  I don't fuck them dicks.  Even big, fat ones like Troy's.  I don't fuck them.  He was obsessed with how big he thinks Troy's penis must be.  It's not gay if you use one of your other personalities.  How's Troy Kwan's nose job?  He called in yesterday.  He's recovering.  How did you?  All right, thank you. 
[01:32:00]  Now we have something to talk about, because I was listening.  I was on the phone with Troy, and Jimmy was in the studio.  How the fuck do you get the big Troy Kwan exclusive?  We talked about him all day yesterday, and you get the Troy Kwan exclusive.  Oh, I know.  How the fuck does that happen?  He was hiding Troy Kwan from us.  I harbor relationships with people.  Whoa.  You guys blow them up.  Nope.  I've been building bridges.  And burning them at the same time.  Nope.  God.  I got a couple bridges built.  Bridges.  Like the one from Temple of Doom.  They're a little rickety, but I got some bridges built right now. 
[01:32:30]  You could fall through.  I got some rickety bridges that are up and running.  I have a good relationship with Troy.  So do we.  Yeah.  Wow.  What did we do to Troy?  And the motherfucker sells me out so bad to Troy.  You were making fun of Troy all day yesterday.  I saw it as a tribute.  It was not a tribute.  Good looks and photography skills.  I enjoyed your spin yesterday.  It was such a spin.  You were able to spin your way out of that.  Oh, I know.  He had you dead in the water.  He totally did.  You were backpedaling more than I was selling you out.  But he fairly had you dead in the water, but you spun out of it.  I tried spinning out of it, yeah.  I was impressed with your spinning skills. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  He got to the point where after one fucking sentence, Troy's throwing me under the bus about my hair.  I didn't misrepresent you, though.  Huh?  I didn't misrepresent you.  You made fun of my hair.  Why don't you misrepresent me?  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did, Brett.  Yes, you did.  I did not misrepresent.  Troy just feels more comfortable on the after show, you know?  Yeah.  It's a comfortable show.  Yeah, no pressure.  Yeah.  See?  We're talking how shitty it is. 
[01:33:30]  I guess.  Yeah.  Nah, you're a good egg on that show.  Thank you.  That's good.  Except when you're fucking selling out the show that is the reason you're doing the show.  I didn't sell you out.  I commented on what was going on on the show.  Oh, family's rats.  Yeah, that is weird.  What is?  You wouldn't have a show if it wasn't for us.  So don't sell us out.  That's right.  Sell everyone else out.  Right.  So I can't ask Troy.  You beat the shit out of us when we leave here.  How do you feel about the fact that you got the shit kicked out of you on the show today?  That's not good for the after show.  Right.  No. 
[01:34:00]  Then I'll rethink my strategy.  Actually, you got me there.  It was great.  It was fun, actually.  And like I said earlier, everyone's downloaded Wicked Games.  Yeah.  Where's our blinded me with science as we go to break?  Dave Vitella, hopefully up next.  Stay there.  He wasn't ready.  Hey, this is Victoria Gotti.  Hey, this is Don Cain.  Because I talk to guys that found the black boxes, and yet our government says they weren't discovered. 
[01:34:30]  Why?  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Michio.  Next step, hopefully you recognize us on the street.  I've only said hi to you a dozen times at this point.  He's just a scatterbrain. 
[01:35:00]  I always think of you, Jimmy.  He's frightened.  He's so frightened.  And I've even said Opie from Opie and Anthony.  You've done this.  Ah, he just.  Ah.  Ah, numbers.  Ah, oh.  Oh, if you were at five with decimal points, I would say hello.  If you looked at him, it went 6.2.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Just.  Oh, relax there. 
[01:35:30]  B.C. woman wants albino rhino off menu at Earl's.  Now, why?  Canadians.  Human rights.  This is a human rights issue.  This is, um, one of these comes out a day at this point.  A Metro Vancouver woman with albinism.  Um, albinism.  That's what they're saying.  Albinism.  Is that being an albino?  Oh, yeah.  Has launched a human rights complaint against a popular chain restaurant saying the restaurant's  albino branding of menu items is going too far.  Oh, stop it. 
[01:36:00]  Uh, and I think they're 진행ing home.  A name I can't even pronounce.  Ikkipanowasa, Arrow, filed a complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal against Earl's  restaurants over its albino rhino line of beer.  And, it's called albino rhino beer?  Albino rhino line of beer.  It sounds delicious.  Albino wings Wednesdays.  So they're promoting with the albino name.  Now, albino rhino, though, is like, there's albino rhinos.  That's a real thing, right?  Yeah, they're very rare. 
[01:36:30]  They're white.  Yes.  I believe.  Very rare.  Show me an albino rhino, please.  Pull up an albino rhino.  I saw the greatest sentence yesterday on the internet.  What?  Oh, yeah, I did.  Whoa.  That's fucked.  That is so cool.  Man, I'd like to hacksaw that tusk off.  So what's the problem?  It's a real thing that has nothing to do with humans.  Exactly.  And by the way, look where she's from where they fucking ritualistically murder albinos. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  The complaint alleges that the marketing of the albino line is demeaning to Eero, this lady,  and all people with the genetic condition known as albinism and is being done deliberately  to evoke a sense of oddness about being albino.  How funny would it be if right now Eero just started playing Frankenstein?  I got this one, too. 
[01:37:30]  This was a staple on your home of rock and roll.  This isn't very child of the 80s.  What?  Yeah, but I did radio, music radio for a long time, so we went back in time and played some  of this shit.  A very famous albino playing this song.  Eero said naming menu items.  Keep it going, man.  Keep it going, man.  Eero said naming menu items after medical or genetic conditions is not commonly acceptable. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, stop.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  You want to rev up this bit?  Rum, rum.  Yeah.  You want to rev this up or what?  What?  AIDS ale?  Things like that?  Something like that.  You go into a restaurant and someone says, can I get a palsy?  Give me a palsy, she said.  I'd love a palsy.  I'd love a fucking palsy.  I would drink St. Palsy, girl. 
[01:38:30]  It's a chicken wing that's all bent.  Give me a palsy.  They bring it out in a little wheelchair.  Yay!  A palsy.  Wow, you went different with that.  Nice.  Sure.  Fucking Jimmy flipped that.  Give me a palsy, she said.  And what it stands for is cerebral palsy cocktail.  I don't think that would fly well at all with anybody with cerebral palsy.  Because what do you mean?  Cerebral palsy.  Cerebral palsy.  Other families who have to live with the condition. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, stop overthinking everything.  And a complainer noted that she was born in Nigeria, where people with albinism are often targeted for ritualistic murder.  I'll take the cirrhosis of the liver and onions.  See, because...  I got it.  We got it.  We got it.  It's terrific.  Yeah.  And there you are, just making fun of yourself there, see?  Of course.  Yeah.  The threat of violent persecution was part of the reason she and her family fled to Canada when she was a teenager. 
[01:39:30]  Mark Barry, vice president of the...  Should I keep reading this shit?  How about you just be grateful you're in Canada and you're out of that shitty fucking country you came from?  And how about you go back to Nigeria and you change the fact that they're ritualistically murdering people?  Yeah.  Instead of taking a brave stand about a fucking beer in a chain restaurant, you dopey bitch.  Got out of there with your pale cunt.  Your fucking...  Your big clit.  It's still attached.  You think your clit is extra white?  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking glowing. 
[01:40:00]  Mark Barry...  It's like a light bright.  It's like the clear, light bright things.  I hate the clear ones.  You just look at a clear, light bright nub.  That's what her clit looks like.  Hurts your eyes.  Mark Barry, vice president of human resources with Earl's Restaurants.  Even restaurants have a human resource department?  Ugh.  Yes.  That must be a treat.  They call it human resource.  It's a restaurant.  Oh, boy.  I sure am pitching them.  Some of them are widening outside.  Yes.  Widening outside?  What?  No.  I'm blowing.  So I'm... 
[01:40:30]  Light it out.  I'm bombing.  I'm bombing.  What's better than a few good bombs in a row?  Oh, I know.  It's like I couldn't pull out of it.  Holy shit.  It's like watching those Vietnam clips out of the back of the plane.  Oh, I'm bombing.  Oh, wow.  That's just such a funny moment to me because people are so afraid of bombing. 
[01:41:00]  Like, that's everybody's greatest fear is telling the joke in bombing.  It's so easy.  Never mind over and over again.  Whew.  A little warm.  Ah, fucky-duggy.  So we got to Mark Barry.  He's the vice president of human resources.  The statement from the restaurant.  Here you go.  Oh, good.  Earl's, the name of the restaurant, created and named its house beer albino rhino 25 years ago.  And in no way meant to be discriminatory to offend.  Of course.  Or offend. 
[01:41:30]  The name was chosen because it was fun and whimsical and sound.  It was.  Denoted something rare and special.  We felt proud to have such a beautiful animal, the white rhino, representing our brand, Barry said.  And terrific.  And they better not fucking change the name.  Nah, they shouldn't.  If they change the name.  Because there's something actually called an albino rhino.  And it's rare.  And people look at it and think of beauty.  Yeah.  I think.  It did not occur to us that the name would be associated with albinism.  Nor did it occur to us it would offend. 
[01:42:00]  And in the 25 years we have been serving our beer, we have never had a complaint about the name until now.  My tweet is mean.  Well, you're right.  Oh, really?  I don't like to quote myself.  I just love it.  Well, you're right.  No, it's just, quoting yourself is embarrassing.  It's just fucking.  Just do it.  For the sake of the show, you have to now.  Let me get it.  I'll find it.  Oh, God.  Now we've got to all, like, search our fucking timeline.  Yeah, search your timeline.  A Canadian albino lady wants albino rhino beer taken off the menu. 
[01:42:30]  That's Mike White of her.  Oh, I meant to write Whitey.  God damn it.  I fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  Let's see.  A Canadian albino lady wants albino rhino beer taken off the menu.  That's Mike White of her.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  Shut up.  Hashtag shut up.  Hashtag dye your hair, asshole.  Hashtag get some sun. 
[01:43:00]  That is just mean.  I was only laughing at dye your hair, asshole.  That is funny.  Dye your hair.  But I fucking, all right, might, Whitey.  I put mighty.  It's humiliating.  Trying to dye fucking albino hair is probably like trying to dye those fucking, what are  those, fiber optic lights?  Those little, you know those lights you get at Spencer Gifts?  Yeah, just pour ketchup on your head, stupid.  It's not bothering everybody.  Go out as fucking Ron Howard.  Andy in Cleveland. 
[01:43:30]  Andy, what's up?  Andy.  Yes, apparently Michael G. Fox is suing to have all chain restaurants remove the term milkshakes.  Oh, see, because he.  I kind of like it.  Yeah, yeah.  David Tell in studio.  Somebody just got his school pictures taken.  Nice haircut.  What's up with all the jibba jabba?  Oh, look at that.  Do a little jibba jabba.  All the jibba jabba.  Yeah, we're just talking about albinos getting all pissed off because they have an albino rhino  beer and this fucking idiot from, where is she from?  Canada.  They have their own beer now? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's a restaurant that named it albino rhino and the albinos, one albino actually is mad.  So they're making a, it's a whole movement.  Well, what did the other one think?  Exactly.  The other one was just writing a follow-up to Frankenstein.  The other one is waiting in line at the Hunger Games.  I'm different.  I'm weird, too.  I'm from the future.  Yeah.  What's up, Patel?  What are you doing?  Well, it's all about that pilot.  Did you guys just talk about that?  Did I miss that?  Oh, shit. 
[01:44:30]  We haven't done our pilot material yet.  Oh, because, you know, I don't know what's going to happen here, but we've got to get  better camera work in the back of planes.  Yeah.  Because they're like, we've got more footage and it's worse than the last footage.  Right?  Yeah.  People can't fucking hold that shit steady.  Instead of a sky marshal, we should have, like, a crew about there.  A cameraman?  Yeah.  A camera crew.  You know, like a Japanese television.  Somebody.  We all carry video cameras now, but most people don't know how to use them properly.  Exactly.  You're absolutely right.  They freak out. 
[01:45:00]  How do you blow a moment like that?  You're on the plane and you can't get good footage of a lunatic?  Yeah, and how do you make that decision, too?  It's like, I'm not going to save the plane.  I'm going to be the reporter.  The videographer.  Why don't they just hold it up as high as they fucking can and hold it still?  Yeah.  The hell is going on?  Maybe at 35,000 feet, you're a little shaky when the pilot is yelling, you know, a la Akbar.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry, sorry.  When the pilot's running up and down the aisle screaming, we're going to die.  It's hard to picture.  Could you hold steady for the lighting?  Hey, do you want hair and makeup first? 
[01:45:30]  I would have screamed something.  I think if he screams that, you should be able to scream something.  Yeah.  I would.  Yeah, what would you?  Would you say something?  I probably would have yelled something like, oh, this is a real comedy of errors.  I would have said, let it ride.  Or remember the Titans.  Or can we get a drink?  Well, I think that was cool that they have a, whatchamacallit, they have a special code  to get into the cabin.  Yeah.  Did you know that?  I did not know that. 
[01:46:00]  What's the code?  Some kind of like, what?  Probably a word or a safe word.  A safe word or something?  Yeah, a safe word.  Yeah, it's probably a fruitcake because he's nuttier than one.  Open Saskatchewan?  Open sarsaparelli?  Yeah, that's weird.  I want to know how the co-pilot got the pilot out of the cockpit.  He tricked him out.  He tricked him?  Yeah, he said, it was like, he said, like, there's a big party out there. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, the pilot awards are going on outside.  Chuck Yeager?  Chuck Yeager's out there?  The pilot awards.  No, he said, he said, like, oh, you better get back there.  There's something going on.  And then he got him out of there.  And then, you know.  Locked the door.  Change the code real quick.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So if you help out, do you get to fly for free?  Like, if you, like, save the plane, do they, like, forever let you fly?  I think so.  It bumps you up in status from, like, silver to gold or gold to platinum when you help 
[01:47:00]  subdue somebody trying to crash the aircraft.  They said that the pilot was actually, when he was in the cockpit, because they had been  flying for about three and a half hours before this happened, and in the cockpit he was saying  stuff to the co-pilot, like, I give up, stuff like, talking about Jesus, are we going to  take a leap of faith, he said, and then he was just pushing various buttons in the cockpit 
[01:47:30]  that the co-pilot said weren't part of what, you know, needed to be pushed, and, yeah.  That's going to be the worst, because do you think they get to, like, pick each other, or  is it just they're, like, you know, kind of, like, speed dating?  They're, it's speed dating, they're put together, I believe it's like they go for a month at  a clip, they'll be flying together, and then they'll bust them up and mix it up with other  people, and I think this was at the beginning of their coupling, so, yeah, it's like a blind  date gone wrong.  I feel bad for whoever gets him next.  Hey, aren't you the, yes, yes, but I'm okay now. 
[01:48:00]  I'm fine, don't worry about it.  I ran all willy-nilly up and down the aisle.  Okay, by the way, the code is, don't open the door no matter what I say.  That's smart, though.  The first month of any relationship is nice, right?  Right, yeah, yeah.  Just when it starts, you know, getting a little fucking squirrely, you get a new partner.  You get a new guy.  I think that's to keep you from getting too complacent with things in the cockpit.  Cahoots.  Like, you start just talking, yeah, cahoots.  They're getting the cahoots with each other.  You don't want them too comfortable in there. 
[01:48:30]  You want to be kind of like, eh, fuck this guy, yeah, but I'm going to pay attention to the  instruments.  And you don't want loyalty to override when a guy makes a mistake.  Ah, true thing.  With much loyalty.  Right, right.  It's not SAC missile command.  Basically, they hit two buttons.  Turn your key, sir.  And they're just sitting there for the next 12 hours.  But that's fucking horrifying.  He's pushing buttons.  He was a big dude.  What are you...  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck, man?  I don't know.  I believe if that fucking first officer wasn't able to get him out of that fucking...  He would have crashed the plane.  It could have been really bad.  He would have crashed the plane.  But then there was another pilot on the plane, too. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, but he was in the back, and he might not have known the code.  Yeah, he might not have known this.  The code again.  Imagine if that guy would have just overtaken the smaller pilot, the daintier one.  Oh, just beat him over the head.  Yes, the sleight of frame pilot.  But how do they pick who's with who?  That's what I want to know.  Like, the co-pilot.  I should know this.  My brother's a pilot.  But really, honestly, the co-pilot is the hothead.  And the older one is, like, the kind of tell-it-like-it-is, you know, Morgan Freeman guy.  Morgan Freeman, yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Giving a narrative the whole time.  But that's an awkward ride anyhow, because, you know, you got to, like, to sit there for whatever, like 10 hours.  Yeah, yeah.  They apparently do a lot of talking about just nothing, not flight-related.  It's not like they're always there going, hey, let's look at the instruments again.  Let's look at that.  How's the altitude?  You know, it's just like they're bullshitting about their dumb lives and their stupid marriages.  I don't think they're allowed to even talk about that.  Because remember, the other guy was talking about, like, you know, raiding the flight crew.  You know, there's a couple of oinkers on the plane. 
[01:50:00]  Right, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was talking about it.  Why are you getting in trouble for that?  I agree, why?  Because the pilot should be, just everybody should be included.  What, it was recorded?  Secretly?  He said a couple of oinkers?  Well, he said something more, oh, poor taste.  There was a lot of poor taste.  He said there was not one, like, you know, effable chick on the plane.  Yeah.  But that shit makes your job tolerable.  But it wasn't just in the cockpit, it was over the PA.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're looking at seat 27 to B and C, you'll see some real fat fucking pigs. 
[01:50:30]  I've had to keep my foot on the rudder pedal the whole time just to balance the fucking plane out.  He'll never fly again.  I'll be coming through the aisles yelling a la Agba.  I hope they, like, totally, you know, it's like, give us your wings.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, break them.  Your rolling bag.  That weird jacket you all wear.  The hat that went out of style in the 20s.  You are no longer a pilot. 
[01:51:00]  You're a bus driver.  Get out of here.  Bring him into the office.  God damn it, Maverick.  You'll be flying rubber dog shit out of Taiwan.  And in a three-hour flight, how much work do they do in that cockpit?  Three buttons, I bet.  Taking off and landing.  Setting the altimeter.  Setting the autopilot.  Pretty much it.  How's it come out that they read and do all sorts of shit in there?  Yeah.  Some of these guys.  Play some cards, chess. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Talk about the sexy stews like it's fucking 1950.  Or do they have to make believe they're doing something the entire time now?  They have to check in with the, as they go through each, you know, with the FAA people.  They get passed off.  What's it called?  Zoning?  Zoning.  They go from zone to zone or whatever?  Yeah.  Oh, goodness.  Jimmy knows.  Either way, I don't like it.  And I think it's going to, something's going to happen again.  Unless we, they've got to rest these pilots out. 
[01:52:00]  That's the thing.  And he was going to Vegas.  That's a good layover.  He could have, you know, got relaxed and all that.  He was upset with that.  Calling it like Sin City.  Oh, so he was a religious guy.  Maybe.  Maybe.  His neighbors said, you know, never an inkling will have any problem.  Never an inkling.  These neighbors.  No.  He borrowed the weed whacker from him and got him.  So he ate it?  He ate it.  I don't think they really do work.  He put it in his asshole and turned it on.  And the rescue workers came and turned it off.  Just a normal guy.  He borrowed the weed whacker and said, we're all going to die.  And he chased the gardener around. 
[01:52:30]  He put it in the zipper like a big penis.  The gardener knew the code.  I think it'd be safer to live next to lunatics then.  Yeah.  As your neighbors.  I like flying to the beginning, but that's why, like, when we're on tour, you know, we  have another date coming up, right?  June 9th.  June 9th.  Nice.  There you go.  Yeah.  Foxwoods.  D-Day plus three.  What's that?  We're going to.  I think D-Day is June 6th.  June 6th.  June 6th.  So anyway, June 9th, we're going to Foxwood.  Foxwoods, myself and Dave and Artie and Nick DiPaolo. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  It's pretty hilarious, man.  Yeah.  We should call this the uplifting tour.  Because.  There's going to be a new level of depravity out there.  Hey, we got info on this guy.  More info coming in this hour.  On the pilot.  Yes.  John in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  The air traffic controlman, I guess, was getting on the guy.  I was nervous because it was so loud.  He said, be quiet.  And turn the vocals off.  Oh.  So he told the air traffic controller.  It's always the air traffic.  To be quiet.  Quiet.  Oh, that's good. 
[01:53:30]  He's trying to nap.  And I think that's the hardest job.  Remember those guys were sleeping all the time?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, see?  When all the action's up in the air.  Yeah.  They don't get any play.  No one's ever done a, what's his name, Sorkin?  He's never done a show about them.  About air traffic controllers.  Yeah.  No.  What movie was it?  Pushing Tits.  I remember that.  To be in those rooms with no windows or anything.  But it seems like it would be a cool video game that you're playing.  You don't have to smoke in there either.  Yeah.  Until you lose a...  But after a while...  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say, after a while, you'd get really good at your video game. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  So how tough could it be for those guys?  But that was the last chain-smoking job.  Oh, yeah.  They allowed it, right?  Yeah.  They were like, please smoke.  Like, here's some cigarettes.  That was...  Some stress.  Yeah.  The opening to Close Encounters.  They show, like, that scene inside the air traffic controllers, and they're smoking, leaning  over the shoulder.  What's that?  Just looked like a cool fucking thing to do.  Fuck, yeah.  Nah, negative.  All those guys were characters on Luck, which was canceled.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  All the horses died?  All the horses died.  You never think of that as an actor.  That's going to be why you get canceled. 
[01:54:30]  All the horses died.  Are you sitting down?  Yeah, they really...  The agent has to make that call to you.  They pushed that show, and it was, I guess, gearing up to be a success.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was...  I heard it boring.  I never saw it.  Yeah.  Well, that's the whole thing.  Why is there a...  I hate to be a Jew here, but why is there a check on the table?  Because I don't trust this company.  I have to get paid each morning for my day's work.  No, you meant the Czech Slovakians sitting over there.  Being a Jew, I don't like to see one of Hitler's dogs. 
[01:55:00]  The Czechs.  I owe Eric money.  For what?  Did you ever explain?  I don't remember.  The cardboard cutout.  Companies are paying for that picture.  How much is a cardboard cutout?  $300.  Would you like to see the cardboard cutout?  It's a life-size one.  Yeah, I love it.  Can we bring the cardboard cutout in?  More expensive than actually getting Jimmy.  Is there like a company that does that?  There is, yes.  Ted's Cardboard Cutout.  Because I'm doing a new show called Adorable Jobs.  That would be great.  Adorable Jobs.  Only in America.  Oh, God.  Only in America. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  Tonight we're going to go to a library.  That's a book house.  International House of Books.  That's a book house.  Where's all the booktoriums?  Holy shit.  Oh, that's fucking good.  Somebody would take that show tomorrow.  It's honorary.  I can't get over watching, because I watch A&E and fucking, all those crime shows.  I love them.  Can't get enough of them.  But then they're also putting these shows on where who gives a shit?  Right.  They're putting so many who gives a shit shows on. 
[01:56:00]  The fucking duck call family.  I don't know that one.  It's a fucking family of hillbillies that make duck calls, and they deemed that, you  know, a good show.  What do they do?  I don't know.  They're just trying to be hillbillies.  It's all fucking badly scripted.  Give me an example of an episode.  What do they do?  Couldn't tell you.  Oh, my God.  I just know they're pretty well off.  It's almost like the Beverly Hillbillies kind of thing, because they got a lot of money,  but they're still dumb hicks.  I actually know the show.  Oh, do you?  Yeah, well, like, every episode, one of them will look out the window, and they see ducks, 
[01:56:30]  and they're like, all right, who did this?  Because they called them.  And then you go back.  They'll backtrack.  I get it.  And they'll show one of them outside, quacking.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  And then they all gather, and then they roll the credits.  Yeah, but then they send some guys.  They come out with metal shoes, and he kicks their duck's stomachs.  And then there's that one dramatic episode where the son is into dancing, and the father  is against it.  But then, all of a sudden, from the back of the big elaborate dance number, he goes, 
[01:57:00]  quack, quack.  Oh, Dad, you believe in me.  I need $3,000.  I'm going to New York.  You're never going to see me again.  Well, the duck family, they have Japanese businessmen come, and they grab the ducks next,  and as they're orgasming, they choke the ducks, so it tightens up on their penises.  As long as he...  What?  What?  What?  Oh, yeah.  What?  Here we go.  What?  Oh, no.  It's just what?  What?  It's a woman.  Work at him.  Look at outcome.  Maybe.  We'll beendi right now.  Three. </pre>
