<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about E-Rock's Green Day t-shirt, a lie masking his actual concert attendance, followed by technical difficulties with Travis's headphones.  The hosts debated Green Day's live performance quality, diverging in their opinions on their musical consistency and tempo.  This transitioned into a segment about inappropriate funeral songs, with listeners sharing anecdotes about playing songs like "Time of My Life" and "Boogie With Stew," and the varied reactions of grieving family members.  A caller then recounted the murder of his grandmother and aunt, prompting a discussion on Chicago's gun control and the unsettling experience of witnessing approaching severe weather, like tornadoes potentially hitting New York City.  One host humorously recounted a power outage experience, navigating his home in the dark armed with a cellphone and a firearm with an integrated flashlight.  The conversation returned to funeral anecdotes and inappropriate music choices, before mentioning upcoming guests Louis C.K. and Seth Rogen, briefly discussing "Funny People" and the challenges of actors portraying comedians.  A listener offered an Andy Kaufman death conspiracy theory, suggesting it was a planned performance.

The show then tackled a listener's supposedly hilarious "best 911 call ever," followed by the playing of Alice in Chains' "Nutshell" (unplugged version) and discussion of various cover versions.  A harsh, vulgar critique of Joan Rivers followed, criticizing her for disallowing jokes about her daughter, Melissa, at a roast, claiming Melissa's success was largely due to her mother's fame.  The hosts played Jim Norton's voicemails; one detailing an awkward encounter with Brendan Fraser, another shockingly revealing Jim ate his own semen, sparking a discussion about bodily fluids.  The hosts reminisced about past guests like George Carlin, Chris Cornell, Mila Jovovich, and William Shatner, and spent considerable time recounting their experiences with the exceptionally bad whistler, "Steve the Whistler." The show touched upon the upcoming "Beer Summit" between President Obama and Professor Gates and a Boston police officer suspended for racist remarks about Professor Gates, using offensive language in the process. The segment concluded with anticipation for Seth Rogen's interview and further discussion of Jim Norton's voicemail revelations.

The next segment started with the hosts expressing strong dislike, using vulgar language, for a currently playing song. This segued into a highly unusual and rambling 911 call, provoking amusement and frustration.  Scheduling conflicts with Seth Rogen and Louis C.K. were discussed, with Louis C.K. eventually confirmed as an in-studio guest.  The “Write It Down Sam” bit was played, albeit deviating from its typical format. A listener-submitted "blown home run call" was mentioned.  Little Nicky (Jerry) presented a short piece.  A significant portion focused on the previous day's Brooke Hogan appearance, with the hosts using highly offensive language to express their intense dislike for her and her music.  Louis C.K. arrived, and the conversation shifted to his experiences, including a critical discussion of a previous Opie and Anthony segment featuring Bobo and E-Rock, involving an offensive anecdote about smelling Bobo's genitals.  Anecdotes about "Florida Steve," "Crazy John," and Eddie, a former coworker, were shared.  The hosts returned to vehemently criticizing Brooke Hogan, then discussed a news story about a man having sex with a horse, leading to a discussion of the legal definition of "buggery," punctuated by the playing of horse sex videos, further discussion of animal mating habits, and a brief discussion of an elk fighting an alligator.  The final part covered a news story about Brooke Hogan's relationship with her father, with Louis C.K.'s commentary, and brief discussion of Wendy Williams, concluding with Louis C.K.'s perspective on doing radio while touring.

A contentious phone call with Bubba the Love Sponge followed, stemming from a disagreement over a comedian's bit about modern conveniences.  The conversation escalated into mutual insults and name-calling, referencing Joe Rogan and Howard Stern, culminating in Bubba hanging up and a subsequent call back with more insults.  A humorous anecdote about an encounter with an Entertainment Tonight interviewer and subsequent heated argument was shared.  This was unexpectedly interrupted by a young, attractive intern from the Covino and Rich show, Jamie, who was coaxed into a brief on-air appearance, leading to playful banter and flirting with Opie. Seth Rogen then joined the show, discussing filming *Funny People*, collaborations with Judd Apatow, portraying comedians in film (referencing *Punchline*), his own start in the industry, *Knocked Up* (including Katherine Heigl's refusal to go topless), online reviews, Hollywood rom-com tropes, and inadvertently influencing Kevin Smith's return to marijuana use. The interview concluded with promotion of *Funny People*.  The segment ended with further discussion of Hollywood movie tropes and observations on modern comedy and romantic comedies.

The final segment began with a movie review of an unnamed "sick, sick, twisted" film.  This transitioned into a discussion about President Obama's comments on the Gates incident, delving into race relations in America, historical injustices, and personal anecdotes about racism and police interactions, including one host recounting a robbery at gunpoint during sex.  The conversation, often employing offensive language, became heated at times.  Snoop (presumably from *The Wire*) made a surprise appearance, discussing his past with crime, incarceration, employment struggles after release, and promoting his projects. The conversation blended personal experiences with discussions about racial dynamics and police interactions. The segment concluded with further jokes and comments on the topics discussed.  The broadcast concluded with a chaotic studio meltdown involving an unnamed host's tense encounter with a "selfie weirdo," mentions of suicide, exchanges with a guest named Dave, escalating outbursts involving Louie, Jerry, and Ronnie, and a mass exodus of hosts and guests. One person remained, contemplating continuing the show before deciding to proceed, possibly transitioning to "The Ron Fez Show."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Why is E-Rock wearing a Green Day t-shirt?  A Green Day concert t-shirt?  He's already been chastised by everybody here.  But he's trying to say he didn't go to see Green Day.  So why would he come in with the concert t-shirt? I don't get that.  And, and, not only that, but it's a shirt we've never seen him wear.  No, he doesn't wear concert t-shirts.  No, or if he does, it's not that one. 
[00:00:30]  And there's creases in it like he just bought it literally five, six hours ago.  When did the concert end?  Exactly.  When did the concert end?  When did E-Rock get home?  Would you go see a Green Day concert? We used to be friends with those guys.  I mean, friends in a way, they would come in all the time and we'd have fun.  If it was like in my backyard, I would.  Well, Travis was trying to say that, I don't know, that they're...  Travis, what were you trying to say? 
[00:01:00]  The phones got really low for some reason.  The what?  The phones got really low.  Headphones?  Mine, yeah.  I don't adjust yours, do I?  I don't know.  It just went down.  Something got adjusted.  That's better.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Now we're rocking.  All right.  It just got low again.  It's like a...  It's impossible to adjust this.  Impossible.  It's one of those things, man.  You just touch it, it goes either really loud or real soft.  Yeah.  There's no easy way to do this. 
[00:01:30]  How about that?  How about that?  Go louder even.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Look how much...  I'm barely moving this thing.  Crank it.  I don't know if I like Green Day is what I'm saying.  A few of their songs, yes.  Yeah.  But they pretty much...  I don't know.  I think they have enough hits.  They have 40 or 50 songs that sound very similar.  They're one of those bands.  Yeah, I got enough...  They got enough hits where I would go see them.  I would go see them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But you need a little...  If it was local, I wouldn't go crazy.  You need a little tempo change, though. 
[00:02:00]  What do they do?  Time of My Life or whatever that song is?  Yeah, they got that slow one.  Which I could never hear again because we played it at my dad's wake.  That was a smart move.  That's good.  Yeah.  Nice way to destroy a song and have that memory every time it comes on the radio.  We could do that bit someday.  Yeah.  A song you really like, so you decide, you know what?  Let's bring it to a wake.  Let me taint it now.  Right.  Forever.  Forever and ever and ever.  I used to like that song.  I'm like, yeah, all right.  Let's play that.  Yeah.  Now, every time I hear it, brings me back to a time I'd rather forget. 
[00:02:30]  Exactly.  Travis, why do you like Green Day?  Trav I.  They write catchy songs.  I don't know what the big deal is.  They've been around, what, 20 years?  But when you go to a show, don't you want, like I said, tempo change?  You want them to be rocking out for a while, song after song after song, and then they slow  it down a little bit, and then they do it.  You know what I mean?  I mean, they go in different directions.  Not necessarily.  Like, maybe for like an arena show, but if I'm going to like, you know, if I'm going 
[00:03:00]  to Irving Plaza or something, like, you know, that's not really bothering me if they  don't, you know, change the tempo.  So, but they're not a band that I would go see at the garden.  They're more, you know, like a band that I would want to see in a small venue, which  is why I would probably never.  An intimate venue.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  But they haven't done that in who knows.  No, the last time I saw them was at Roseland, and that had to have been 10 years ago.  Wow.  How old were you then?  12?  18.  Oh, my God. 
[00:03:30]  18?  Were you holding a cat, and did you have blonde hair?  No.  Bleached hair?  No, I didn't bring my cat everywhere with me.  Well, I assumed you did from that picture, that gay-ass picture of you holding your cat.  We don't have to go there.  Well, we did.  That was a long time ago.  We just did.  What's your favorite Green Day song?  I don't have a favorite Green Day song.  Oh, everyone does.  Thank you.  That proves my point, by the way.  Because they all sound the same, the songs.  So why would you pick one?  That's not true.  They kind of sound the same.  But what happened?  Charles is lying, though, because sometimes Green Day comes up in conversation, and we 
[00:04:00]  both enjoy the first.  I love Green Day.  Yeah, and you like the first two albums.  Yeah.  So you must have a favorite off of the first two albums.  Dookie?  Off of the first two albums.  No, Dookie was the third album.  Dookie was the third album?  Yep.  Wow, look at me.  Dookie.  Wow, really?  Yep, you got 1039 smoothed out Slappy Hours.  That was their debut record.  Well, that was the one no one bought.  I bought it, and Kerplunk.  Yeah, all right.  But that's when everyone else started paying attention, right?  The second album?  Yeah, I mean...  It happens with a lot of bands. 
[00:04:30]  You want a favorite song?  Sure.  Going to Pasal Aqua.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That's off their first album.  I like who wrote Holden Caulfield.  That's a good one, too.  I like 2,000 Light Years Away off Kerplunk.  At the library.  Yes.  All right.  I really hate to be a pain, but these headphones just are...  It's like they're not even on.  It's like they're not even on.  Yeah.  See, all right, wait.  Because this is paying...  It's like they're not even on.  All right, get ready.  Get ready.  All right.  Here's the adjustment.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  How's that? 
[00:05:00]  That's a little better.  How's that?  That's much...  Well, it's better.  Yeah, but now it's like kind of...  It's sharp.  Is it?  Yeah.  Can you turn yours down?  I can turn this down over here.  Like turn that down and then...  Yeah.  And you want me to turn you up more?  Just a little bit.  Are you kidding?  I swear.  I'm getting like...  We're past the Marky Marks.  Oh, my God.  Are we really?  That's about...  I love how people think...  That's about it.  I love how people think I'm like the ultimate board op. 
[00:05:30]  I just go with the Marky Marks.  It's like wherever the Marks are.  No, I call them the Marky Marks.  Marky Marks.  That's good.  Right there.  I'm getting some volume now.  Now it feels like I'm actually talking into a microphone.  Play time of your life at Grandma's Wake.  Justin in San Antonio.  What's up, Justin?  It's the funeral song.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I played not at the wake at their funeral.  It was my grandma and my aunt after they were murdered.  Jesus.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  So every time we hear that song...  We got to play time of your life, Sam.  It was murder.  Why were they murdered?  My douchebag is my aunt's second husband.  He kind of snapped, I guess, and murdered him.  Oh, that's wonderful.  How'd he do it?  He called him and said that he wouldn't be at the house.  And I guess he was hiding somewhere in the house.  And, um, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  What a ghoul.  No, I mean, knife, gun, what do you use?  Oh, gun.  Yeah, say, we got to take the guns.  Yeah, get the guns away.  Away from people.  Everybody.  Say, because it causes bad things.  Bad things.  Yeah.  I did a whole thing last night about that 14 people, I guess, were shot in Chicago in  one night.  Really?  Yeah, 14 people just gunned down in Chicago in one night.  Well, that proves we got to take the guns away.  Yeah.  You know what the gun control law is in Chicago?  You're not allowed to have one. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  That's the law.  You can't have one.  How much more gun control than you cannot have one can there be?  And it kind of proves that it doesn't work.  Where are they getting all the guns from?  I don't know.  Not from the legal frigging gun owners because there aren't any.  Are they stealing guns from people that have them legally from other states and what's  not?  I don't know.  But you know something?  People in Chicago aren't allowed to have it.  There's strictest gun control law ever.  14.  And there's people just being gunned down because thugs are always going to be able to 
[00:07:30]  get the guns.  Always.  In one night, 14 people?  Yeah.  Different situations, too.  Wow.  Like five here, three there.  You know.  All neighborhoods with famous people's names on the street signs.  You know.  You know.  Usually some reverends here.  What are some of those names?  What are some of those names?  Some of the...  Martin Luther King Boulevard.  Malcolm X.  Malcolm X Boulevard.  Frederick Douglass Boulevard. 
[00:08:00]  George Washington Carver.  Boulevard.  Right off the peanut butter court.  Justin.  So you played Time of Your Life at Grandma's Wake after she was murdered, right?  Yeah.  After they were murdered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you don't really like hearing that song either, huh?  Yeah.  I totally have to agree with you.  So...  Yeah.  It seems like a good idea at the time.  I don't think we've ever done this break on the air.  Another song I can't hear.  What is it called?  That Zeppelin song, Boogie With Stew? 
[00:08:30]  Is it called Boogie With Stew or just...  Help me out with the title.  Boogie With Stew.  Boogie With Stew.  And the reason, because my brother's roommate in college, his name was Stew.  And he was a terrific fella.  Yeah.  And he decided to, you know, drive from Geneseo all the way back to Long Island.  And he was in a head-on horrific car accident.  Great.  And Stew was no longer with us.  So we all thought it would be a great idea to have, like, a little memorial at the college 
[00:09:00]  and play Boogie With Stew.  So that's another song I just don't feel like hearing ever again.  You know something?  I am just realizing I have one of those, too.  You do?  Yeah.  A friend motorcycle square into a telephone pole.  Just dead.  Closed casket.  Dead.  Yeah.  Yeah, real bad.  So there were just pictures of him and stuff like that.  Freebird?  No.  But close enough.  Because right when I walked in...  And it didn't matter any songs that were playing after that.  Because they figured they would just play a bunch of, like, mellow-ish tunes of kind 
[00:09:30]  of, you know, things like that.  But you know, there's the one song that brings it all together.  It was right when I walked in.  And peaceful, easy...  I got a peaceful, easy feeling.  The Eagles?  Yeah.  It was playing.  So it's like that song, every time it comes on.  And I'm talking probably 25 years.  Yeah.  But still, to this day, when that song comes on, I change it.  Because I don't need that.  No.  I don't need it. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, we went over the top.  There was a nice, like, video montage of my dad with that song playing.  I'm like, oh my god.  How sad do we all want to really get?  Real sad, apparently.  Not a fan of the, let's bring the sadness all the way down.  Yeah, yeah.  It's at a good level because of what happened.  Let's just keep it there.  Yeah.  I don't think you really need to amp up the sadness when the whole situation is as sad  as it gets.  It's one of my things, man.  And when something horrific happens to you, the sadness is there.  Just let it be there. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Don't bring it down to another level.  Right.  Why do you need to do that?  You don't need a sadness planner.  Right.  That comes in and plans more sadness.  No kidding.  Here we go.  You need more sorrow.  We're not getting enough sorrow in this corner of the room.  Right.  How can we get more sorrow and mourning and sadness?  Well, let's bring in the unstable cousin to fall down.  Do you have any relatives that will really lose it?  Right.  Because we need something in this part of the room.  Maybe some wailing and screaming. 
[00:11:00]  Let's bring in the uncle that hasn't been seen in three days and we think he might have  killed himself over this death.  Jesus.  It's horrible.  That's why I think you just got to go off by yourself and just mourn alone.  That's it.  Because the other people will just.  That's it.  I had the falling down cousin.  I'm like, come on.  She was 92.  I mean, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  We're sad.  We remember stuff.  So young. 
[00:11:30]  92.  Come on.  Still so full of luck.  No.  So full of luck.  Come on.  To make it to 92.  Yeah.  One of those should be.  That should be just a beer drink in good time.  Right.  For real.  Yeah.  With a few tears.  It's like, oh, yeah.  Oh, but anyway.  92.  What a life.  Yeah.  Celebrate that.  Hell fucking.  Yeah.  That's where I'm at with that shit.  Yeah.  But the rest of the relatives have to bring it down to a fucking morbid.  I don't want to be this low place.  You know, I don't mind because I recently had, you know, grandma's funeral there about, I 
[00:12:00]  don't know, a couple of months ago, I guess it was.  A few months ago.  And I don't mind when people come in and they're like, hey, hey, man, what's up?  Yeah.  I'm sorry to hear.  You know, and you're like, yeah, you know, whatever.  She was in her 90s also.  So it's like, yeah, you know, whatever.  And people hanging out and talking about my uncle Joe and stuff like that.  But then there are people that come in, they, they grab your hand and they hold it tight  and it's usually someone that's old and it's shaking and they're just like, I'm so terribly  sorry about your loss. 
[00:12:30]  And you're like, could you fucking knock it off?  Could you knock it off?  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  Their bony, veiny hand is holding your hand and shaking your loss.  You know, I, you need to know what a wonderful person she, shut up.  You do know that's not about you, right?  That's about them.  No, it's about them.  Okay, good.  At least you know that.  Christ.  That's about them.  Enough.  Just come in and my friends will come in and they're like, hey, what's up, man? 
[00:13:00]  How you doing?  Come over and they're like, yeah, this sucks.  I'm like, yeah, you know, what are you going to do?  I go, she was old.  They go, nah, I'm sorry to hear and stuff.  They go to my mom.  Same thing.  They're like, yeah, we're all, you know, sorry about that.  And my mother's the same way.  She's like, you know, she had a nice long life.  And by the end of it, there's a sadness because she was your grandma.  It's more sadness over memories and all that stuff.  Right, the memories.  It's going to happen to all of us.  Things like that.  And if you could check out in your 90s, who wouldn't take that contract?  There you go.  And if I get that contract, you party your asses off all you youngsters that listen to us. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, my dear sweet Lord, Anthony.  How are you dealing?  How are you dealing?  I'm fine with it until you put your fucking Nosferatu hands.  Enough, you morbid bitch.  Get away from me.  Going to be looking at you in a box soon, too.  So knock it off.  I hate that shit.  I had an aunt.  She went at 101.  A hundred and one. 
[00:14:00]  Pushing 102.  Pushing 102.  Pushing 102.  Pushing 102.  And you know what?  They were cool.  That was a good wake.  I guess the older you get, the more it's just like, bah.  Dude, her kids for her 100th birthday gave her like box seats for the Mets game.  Really?  Yeah.  She, you know.  I would like to have those tickets if I could go with her.  And she died just, you know, watching TV.  Just kind of.  That's it, huh?  Kind of just faded away at 101, almost 102.  Triple digits.  You can't argue with that. 
[00:14:30]  And one of those famous, you know, she still lives by herself.  All that crap.  She went to the bathroom by herself.  She made her own bed.  Yeah.  So I love the accolades that people get when they reach those older years.  She puts on her own slippers in the morning.  Right.  She washes her own face.  She makes her own coffee.  It's amazing what she could do.  Yeah, like they're in third grade.  She could put the blocks in all the halls that are the same shape.  Right. 
[00:15:00]  She finger paints.  When my cousin died, we played Sarah McLachlan, Arms of an Angel.  Oh, God.  How maudlin.  You know, we weren't even.  You know what?  This is why we're the greatest radio show ever.  Ever.  Ever.  We weren't even going to talk about this.  We were going to talk about the horse fucker and the Obama beer thing.  Yeah.  And now we got a nice little topic here.  Tom, Long Island, what do you got?  Hey, my cousin died out in Pennsylvania. 
[00:15:30]  We're all sitting at the funeral with the burial.  And then eerily quiet, the priest would sit head down and throw it windy.  And out of nowhere, my cousin turned the car radio on and Sarah McLachlan in the Arms of an Angel.  So every time I hear that song, talking about it now, my skin crawls.  See?  See?  It's freaking awful.  Here it is.  Wow, we hit on something today.  Here it is.  You guys rock.  Arms of an Angel.  All right, sir.  Oh, do you need this during sorrow? 
[00:16:00]  Another Sarah McLachlan reflection song.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Does this chick ever just like hang out and drink beers and have fun?  You think she laughs?  Or is she just reflecting on everything all the time?  You think when she sees somebody slip on the ice and fall, she goes up to them like,  Oh, you slipped on the ice.  And helps them up.  Right.  With a gentlest, the gentlest lifting up.  And someone goes, You're Sarah McLachlan.  She goes, It's not about me right now. 
[00:16:30]  And then she just writes a dumb poem.  A poem about how sorrowful it was to watch that person fall.  Meanwhile, everybody else is, Ah!  You see him fall?  This broad's got to be a drag to hang out with.  What a drip.  What a...  It's of an angel.  By the way, my fucking coffee house rocked yesterday.  Did it?  I'm not giving up on coffee house.  And I...  Wow.  And it is some kind of acoustic show they do. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, it's a specialty show.  I just don't know when.  I was listening from 11 to 2 yesterday.  So somewhere in there, they do some kind of acoustic hour that fucking rocks.  I didn't hear Indigo Girls, and I didn't hear this Sarah McLachlan shit.  Sarah McLachlan.  Nothing but cool acoustic covers.  Danny's tearing up now.  Danny, you sad?  Danny's tearing up because of Sarah McLachlan.  Yes.  I think of all those poor puppies and kitties.  I know.  It's always the puppies and kitties with this chick.  God, she sucks. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, you know what?  I'm not going to even lie.  One of these songs thrown into, like, if you listen to music, I'm all right with.  But every song is like this.  But not for a goddamn death dedication.  No fucking no.  Let's go to Chris in Virginia.  Chris.  Good evening.  Good evening.  I just want to say, this is such a random break.  My grandfather died yesterday.  Ooh.  I'm so sorry.  My uncle called yesterday and says, hey, your mom's real torn up. 
[00:18:00]  Can you put together something for your grandfather?  My sister and I avoided this completely just so we didn't have any of these horrific memories.  We decided to go with a random way of church music in the background of the montage.  Like it out.  Just church music like friggin' hymns and psalms.  Let's go to Ryan in Indiana.  Ryan.  Good evening.  Hey, Ryan.  What's up, man?  Listen, listen.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  We're almost at our good evening quota because we don't want to ruin that bit. 
[00:18:30]  No.  Because that's one of the ones we look forward to every day.  It makes us laugh.  I like that one.  Good evening.  Right.  But we already got two in and then we're only on the air 20 minutes so far.  What do you got, Ryan?  Yeah.  Do you think they'll play Monday, Monday at Steve C's Wake?  Linger longer.  Good one.  Monday, Monday.  Won't come in on that day.  Monday, Monday.  That's the day I just like to stay away. 
[00:19:00]  And I will go to the wake and go, wow, there's a lot of dudes here.  What's this about?  What's this guy in the leather hat?  The assless chaps.  I haven't met any of these fuckers.  Where were all these guys when Steve was alive?  Monday morning, I'd rather be sleeping in.  I'll tell Iraq to take off every Friday. 
[00:19:30]  What's up with this tornado on Long Island?  I think it was in Jersey.  Really?  I see Wontog.  No, it's Wontog.  Oh, Wontog.  Yeah, another place in Jersey that sounds like Wontog.  Oh, really?  Yeah, some cow farm and shit.  Well, they're scared because the-  A bunch of barns came down.  People are freaked out because the cows decided to sleep outside yesterday.  Yeah.  And they're trying to figure out what that fucking means.  It meant that they didn't want to be inside a barn that collapsed during some alleged tornado. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Yeah, supposedly.  And then they got to send out these weather people to see if it was a tornado.  They look for circular break patterns in branches and stuff.  Well, I was recording nature shots last night.  No way!  I didn't get anything good.  Lightning or sunsets?  No.  Well, actually-  What about a sunrise?  I actually posted four sunset pictures and one guy said, all right, you fucker.  What did that guy write?  I don't even know if he's a fan or not.  I saw that one. 
[00:20:30]  He's like, enough of your fucking sunsets.  Enough with the sunsets.  No, the footage isn't good enough to do anything with, but I'm filming every day because we've  got thunderstorms.  We've got lightning.  And then someone wrote me and goes, you better have your camera set up.  They're saying tornadoes might hit Manhattan.  I'm like, what?  That sounds impossible.  Can you imagine if you see one of those fucking things roll in?  Why not?  That sounds impossible.  I don't think the wind can work itself up in that kind of city environment. 
[00:21:00]  No.  I don't think with the buildings, with the way it kind of diffuses the wind-  What if it comes in from Jersey because it's nice and flat?  It comes in from Jersey.  It just gives us a nice quick hit.  I don't know.  I don't think it could build up like that.  I think it's a-  I don't think New York, even Jersey, like around New York.  Like, they get tornadoes in Jersey like what you just saw.  That fucking farm.  Right.  Shit.  But around big buildings and stuff, I don't think you get tornadoes. 
[00:21:30]  We might have to get a weather expert.  They really can't-  I don't think the weather can build up to the point where you really-  The conditions are right with the rising and falling air, the hot and the cold.  I think the city holds too much heat.  I don't know what it is.  The sky yesterday afternoon looked like it was literally alive.  Yeah, yeah.  It really was creepy.  I love seeing the sky, whatever.  But when those storms are coming in and you see, you're like, that fucking thing is alive.  Yeah.  Monstrous.  Is that going to be a tornado?  Is that going to be a hailstorm? 
[00:22:00]  What is that?  Monstrous.  The just really high, dark, grayish, black clouds just kind of moving in?  We were talking about stuff.  I believe it was off the air yesterday when we were talking about lightning and that if  you sent a probe, if we didn't have lightning here on Earth and never saw it, knew nothing  of it and sent a probe to a planet like we do every so often, we sent a Mars, Venus, Saturn,  whatever.  And NASA scientists went, by the way, every so often, without any warning, bolts of electricity 
[00:22:30]  come from the sky and hit the ground at millions of volts.  You'd be like, I am never going to that planet.  Why would you go there when randomly huge amounts of electricity come out of the sky and slam  into things?  But because it happens here, we're just like, oh, it's called lightning.  It's pretty cool to see. 
[00:23:00]  But we would be like, we'd be petrified of a place where lightning comes out of the sky  and just hits the ground randomly.  Why haven't we been able to figure out how to take that energy?  I don't know.  We can't really harness that.  It's pretty much a random thing, but you would think if they set up like harvest stations,  which I hate that word, harvest, and somehow all you need is lightning to kind of hit these  harvest areas every once in a while.  Like batteries or capacitors or something.  I don't know.  I'm not a fucking scientist, but it seems like we should have figured that one out because 
[00:23:30]  that energy is pretty amazing, like you're saying.  They do have a way of getting lightning where they want it, to study it.  They take these rockets with this very fine metal wire, and when they feel the sky is  building up enough negative and positive energy rubbing together like that, they send  a rocket up, and it actually follows the wire down.  Wow.  So there is a way to get it where they want it.  So why can't they now?  I don't know. 
[00:24:00]  Danny just looked at a thing that said, why can't we harness the power of electricity?  Storing energy is not practical.  That's why we actually shut down power plants during times of the day with limited power  usage.  We can create far more power each year than we do, but we can't feasibly store it long  term.  It's not as simple as building really big batteries.  There are very few places where such a device would actually be useful.  The Empire State Building is really one of the very few.  Really?  That's interesting.  So it comes down to trying to figure out how to store it. 
[00:24:30]  It's not economical to store power.  Huh.  I never knew that.  I didn't know that either.  This is such an educational program.  Is it?  For the retarded.  Speaking of power, power failure at the compound this morning.  I woke up to the iPhone.  Oh, fuck.  You have lung cancer.  What the fuck is that?  I mean, what color was that? 
[00:25:00]  I decided to get sick in the middle of summer.  That's normal.  Oh, my God.  I think I'm going to throw up.  Dude, I looked over for a second.  I think it's mixed in with some coffee.  That's all.  Oh, OK.  I don't think.  Holy shit.  I thought that was coming out of your lungs.  If it is, man.  I see a doctor immediately.  If it is, I better go to the doctor.  Brown shit coming out of your lungs.  You don't even smoke.  I just had time to see a doctor.  I just had coffee.  So I think I think that was mixed in there.  When do you think OB should go see a doctor?  When do you think maybe OB should see a doctor? 
[00:25:30]  As soon as possible.  So no lights at the compound.  Yeah.  So I woke up to the iPhone screeching at me and I opened my eyes and it's just pitch black.  Wow.  It's like, oh, this is great.  Power's out.  So it's kind of a new thing you do where you just walk around with your cell phone.  Oh, I do that every morning.  It used to be a candle or a flashlight.  And now it's just now you take the cell phone.  And the thing is, though, you got to keep touching the screen so it doesn't go black. 
[00:26:00]  So like I put my pants on, touch the screen, pick out a shirt, touch the screen.  Can't there be an app for that?  There is.  There's a flashlight app.  There is.  So you should get that.  Yeah, I know.  And I've always not gotten it because I go, I got a flashlight.  My flashlight was downstairs.  You know, it's funny.  But I also did at one point, then I pulled out my 45, which has the flashlight on the bottom.  Well, you got to.  And then I'm pointing my gun at my clothes.  Jesus.  I'm like, okay, this will work.  So you got to get a video of that.  That's a video I would check out. 
[00:26:30]  But you don't realize how much longer things take in pitch black.  It was a good thing I got up early because I was able to get everything done.  But just a simple thing like brushing your teeth while you have to keep touching the iPhone screen.  I got three broken toes because I get ready in the morning in the darkness.  Why don't you flip a light on?  Because I don't know.  Yeah, that's a good.  You should just flip a light on.  I don't know.  I mean, I flip the bathroom light on and then kind of a hallway light.  Because light at 430 in the morning is like. 
[00:27:00]  That's a bitch.  We're not bats.  Once I'm out of bed, poof, the lights go on like crazy.  Yeah, it's just.  Grand Central Station at my house.  BlackBerry, I got to tell you, has a horrendous light.  Really?  My old BlackBerry, I was like you.  I would just go.  It would be like.  Exactly.  Like a lightsaber.  This one is too dim.  It's kind of a bummer, actually.  Because, you know, I could completely relate.  You should have brightnesses all the way up?  Yeah, I think so.  You know what?  Maybe it's not.  Maybe that setting's off.  See?  Now I got to look at that.  You want to go back to the phones with the. 
[00:27:30]  Look at that.  With the sad songs.  Oh, hells yeah.  All right.  We'll get to the horse fucker soon and the Obama beer story.  And then one of the cops just.  Almost proven Gates right.  Almost.  I was like, what are you doing?  All you got to do is keep your fucking mouth shut.  Shut it.  We'll give you those details in a minute.  But first.  You know what?  I lost the best one. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, no.  Where, like, somebody was so distraught at a wake, they try to put themselves in the coffin.  Oh, I hate those.  Do we need that?  Oh, with a crawl.  Lifting their leg up.  I just want to be with them for one last.  They're crawling up into the coffin.  Everybody's turning around like, oh, fuck.  I don't want to see this.  Now the responsible uncles have to get involved.  They're like, no, it's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay for a minute.  Yeah.  That's because I got the lung butter.  You got to get a little more lung butter out. 
[00:28:30]  You know, Tom in Virginia.  That is disgusting.  Lung butter.  Tom in Virginia.  Yeah, my cousin committed suicide by sitting on the railroad tracks.  We're sitting in church, and the same train came by blowing the horn while we're sitting there during the mass.  Oh.  You know that was the devil, right?  Yeah.  That was the devil.  The devil's train.  You can't control this shit.  Damn, that's fucked up.  Wow, he decided to bail on that. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  All right.  He got hit by a train.  My grandfather, when he died back, I believe it was late 70s or something, you know, kind of kid walking up, funeral going on.  And that one, he wasn't, you know, old.  He wasn't a kid or anything, but he wasn't an old guy like my grandmother was when she died.  So, you know, it was a little more sad and everything.  And, you know, people crying around the hole in the ground, and they got that stupid festive tent up over everything. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, really?  Because it was raining.  You went old school?  It was so, like, because it was raining and everything.  I've never, well, I've been to enough, so I guess it's not even a knocking on something thing.  But I've never been where they, I've never been at the actual gravesite for the ceremony.  What?  That's, it's always been somewhere else.  Well, the funeral funeral, where they actually lower the goddamn.  Hell fucking no.  You've never been to the cemetery?  Hell fucking no.  Wow.  Yeah, that's, that is a bad part. 
[00:30:00]  Well, when my dad died.  It's worse than the wake.  When my dad died, it was a military thing, and they have an area.  And then, you know, it's like, all right, you're free to go.  And then, you know, you go back.  Oh, I got it.  You go back later.  When my grandma told you the story, at Pine Lawn, they have an area, which is like, it's, what do you call that area?  It's like a, like a shack.  Like a, like a, yeah, it's, it's like a, it's a holding area.  Yeah, it's a little holding area.  And I told you, me and my brother went out the back door to see the Mexicans waiting to, you know, fucking drop the coffin in the ground so they could have lunch. 
[00:30:30]  You never did that thing where you pick up the rose and you walk past and throw it on the coffin?  Yeah, that's in the holding area.  I've never had to do it at the actual.  No, it's right at the hole.  I've never had to do that one.  Wow.  No, we do it right at the hole.  No, I've never done that.  Oh man.  They put that fake AstroTurf around the hole to make it so you don't see dirt.  They cover up the dirt pile with like AstroTurf.  Make it all nice.  Or something so it doesn't look like a big pile of dirt that you look at and go, well, they'll be under that for eternity.  Within an hour.  Yeah, within an hour.  And then, you know, right. 
[00:31:00]  Until the jaw drops.  Sorry, but I interrupted you.  But I've never been at one of those.  So yeah, my grandfather.  And then right when he goes, and we commit his body to the ground.  This giant whirling wind just started out of nowhere and got everybody like going.  They start crying again like his spirit was, was that right?  You know that.  It was a gust of wind.  Oh, thank you.  That was just a coincidence.  Of course it was.  I don't know your grandfather, but I don't think God singled him out that day. 
[00:31:30]  He sat on his ass and watched the Mets game while he drank Schaefer.  I don't think he's conjuring up fucking tornadoes at his funeral.  I'm kind of a fan of the symbol, but then you think about it.  All right, what, God decided to single out my dead relative today?  Yeah, yeah.  You know how many other people are dead today alone?  He's putting little weather things at everyone's funeral stage.  Just stop it.  And then all of a sudden, it would have been the same thing if it was cloudy and all of  a sudden clouds broke and the sun shined through.  Oh, really?  Although when John Lennon died, it did snow in New York for an hour and then stopped. 
[00:32:00]  That was pretty.  That's happened.  Any old school New Yorkers, do they remember that?  That's happened.  That was kind of creepy.  If it was July, then it would be creepy.  But then again, John Lennon said he was, what, more famous than God or whatever the famous  quote was.  Yeah, more famous than Jesus.  So maybe that was God's way of going, oh, yeah, can you make it snow?  Watch this.  Wow.  I messed up that word, too.  It's still, you know, it is early still.  No, I said it.  We've got to realize.  I said you can only give us a break till what, 630? 
[00:32:30]  That's true.  But God's saying, yeah, can you make it snow?  I can.  Yeah.  Why is he calling me out on this?  Bro in Iowa.  I don't know your name.  It's not on the screen.  What's up?  I'll call you out.  Mr. Josh, you said you never been to the cemetery for a funeral, but didn't you watch  your aunt get married by the Mexicans that time?  No, I just told the story.  It was my grandma, and I didn't actually see what I...  All of a sudden, is it a priest or whoever's at the cemetery says, this now concludes... 
[00:33:00]  Our broadcast day.  Basically.  And it's an eternal beep with a test pattern.  So I'm like, what do you mean?  We just all leave?  Because we're in the moment.  The casket's there.  The roses are being put on the casket.  The light is shining nice because it was a nice sunny day.  It was a nice moment.  And then all of a sudden, the guy out of nowhere goes, that's it.  And everyone's like, that's it?  No, we got to do something else.  We can't...  What?  You can't just say it's over.  Please leave.  So me and my brother kind of went out the...  I keep saying the back door, but we went to behind the holding area. 
[00:33:30]  And we saw the Mexicans basically kind of standing on their shovels with one foot,  kind of looking at their watches like, come on, let's go.  We got lunch to get to.  No, she's dead.  It's time to leave.  We did...  Me and my brother walked over, and we went, oh, all right.  This is the hole she's going to be in.  And then there was a pile of dirt, and that was it.  I'm amazed because everyone I've been to has been at the hole.  No.  Right at the hole.  You see that whole thing?  And then my grandmother, it was, you know, they bury them, I guess, on top of each other. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Grandma and grandpa.  Maybe they didn't want to be, you know.  Maybe they hated each other.  Eternity.  They're just on top of each other.  Grandma's on top now.  How emasculating.  Wouldn't you want some young chippy that died in a drunk driving accident on the way home from her prom?  I'm on top, yeah.  On top.  They used to do the side-by-side, but I guess that's more expensive than the up and down.  What's the difference?  I know.  So they dig the hole, and you look at the tombstone there, and there's grandpa's, like, date. 
[00:34:30]  He died and stuff like that, born and died.  And then grandma's is born, and then the died isn't even in yet.  And they're digging up the old grave to put her on top, and it's just morbid.  So you're standing there at the hole, and there's, like, a little party tent.  A little party tent over everybody.  Right at the hole.  Then you throw the roses on the coffin, and then you get back to your car.  I've seen it on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On TV. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, and then you go back, especially if you're Italian, you go back to the house and, you know, make like no one died, and it's just Thanksgiving.  You go around, you eat, and then you drink, and you start laughing and forgetting that you were sorry about anything.  Yeah, it's just like Thanksgiving, but you're like, man, someone's missing.  Someone's missing.  Where's – hey, grandma, could I –  Oh, that's right.  That's why we're here.  Oh, no.  No, she's dead.  Oh, she's not going to be bringing out the pie. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm sure she's hungry about now, but she doesn't get to eat ever again.  You're eating, and she's in a closed box with a piece of, like, silk an inch away from her nose.  With bugs trying to figure out how to get to the buffet.  Bugs going, fresh meat.  Jesus.  Ugh.  This is how you got to talk about this stuff so we're not as scared.  We had tornadoes in the Poconos. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this one is –  You got to take shelter in a champagne glass, in a giant champagne glass.  And that happens in the Poconos.  Mike in West Virginia.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, man.  A few years ago, my aunt had died, and we were at this little church for the services, and she was cremated.  And they were playing this sad little church music, and out of nowhere, her brother, who had one too many to drink, jumps up on the stage, grabs his guitar, and starts playing fucking dust in the wind. 
[00:36:30]  Ugh.  Dust in the wind with a cremated person?  Exactly.  It was, like, the most fucking unnerving thing you've ever seen.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Everybody's just looking at each other, just going, oh, shit.  Damn.  Thanks, guys.  Right on, brother.  Another great moment.  But I have a few of these dumb memories.  See?  See?  When my father's mother died, my grandmother on my father's side, she's married to this guy, Norman, at the time. 
[00:37:00]  And she dies.  They cremate her.  She died in California.  So then he drives back with the ashes.  That's going to be a long ride.  To bury her.  I know, right?  At least she shut up the whole drive, for fuck's sake.  Like, just put her in the passenger seat and go, you finally aren't seeing a peep the whole fucking drive.  Norman, I'm hungry.  Norman, slow down.  Norman.  So, um, you're being buried at Pine Lawn. 
[00:37:30]  That's where everybody gets buried, apparently.  And, uh, so we go.  And she's cremated.  Her ashes are in a shoebox.  A plain brown shoebox that just in Sharpie said Mildred on the top.  And I looked at that fucking thing.  And then the priest took some holy water and just said it's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then he does the swoosh, swoosh with the holy water, which just left wet marks on the shoebox. 
[00:38:00]  Smeared the name Mildred.  So now, now there's the wet shoebox with Sharpie Mildred spelt on the top.  And I'm looking going, and I'm remembering now, like, Christmas when I was, like, six.  And Nana coming over, Mildred, you know.  Nana coming over and giving us money and presents.  And just our whole life and everything.  And I look and go, that's what it fucking amounts to.  Your name scrawled in Sharpie on a wet shoebox that they're now going to just kick in a hole. 
[00:38:30]  They didn't have anything.  It didn't go into another box?  That was it.  That was it.  Wow.  The shoebox goes right in the ground and they shovel dirt on it.  Probably not a bad way.  Yeah, you know, not a bad way.  But just to see that image, it's people don't think they don't think or or no one says anything because that was kind of like just sad, a sad ending. 
[00:39:00]  It's like watching a movie with a sad ending.  I guess you got to dress it up a little bit, a little better than just Mildred spelt in a shoebox.  Your life amounted to Mildred on a shoebox.  And, dude, it wasn't even in like if it was in calligraphy, it would have been better.  It was just some bad.  It was like it might as well put been put fragile, you know, because you got some some fucking little trinkets in there while you're moving.  Right.  Pack her in fucking bubble wrap and write fragile on the outside. 
[00:39:30]  Write it quick because we're in a hurry.  That's a that's pretty bad.  So that sticks out in my head.  It's like they could have done, you know, a nice wooden box made of pine or something even.  It doesn't have to be good wood.  Maybe a little.  It was small.  So a little mahogany box with the name etched in it.  I think it should really just end with the wake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For real.  You don't really need to be there for the plan.  Because that's when it gets too real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's your goodbye.  Bye bye. 
[00:40:00]  And that's where the real just horrendous sadness does come into play.  Because you're you're just in a cemetery.  Sad enough.  Right.  You're by the big hole.  Right.  And then the people are just kind of looking like, well, this is it.  Once they plant it.  No, you can't have any small talk with anyone in that situation.  You can't like you can't throw a few one liners or nothing.  Everyone's got their sun.  Go there.  Don't watch me cry.  Sunglasses on.  I'm now Hollywood.  I don't I don't want to be seen with tears in my eyes.  Sunglasses.  I'm Hollywood.  Leave me alone. 
[00:40:30]  I like to go to those and get those big sunglasses.  You wear it football games.  The giant ones and put those on.  Go.  I'm really crying.  I'm really sad.  So I need the giant prop sunglasses.  I got crocodile tears.  And I wear the big styrofoam cowboy hat with them.  And a number one glove with the beer holder.  Grandma was number one.  I mean, there's way too many.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Let's try Ziggy in Buffalo.  Ziggy.  Morning, boys.  How are you doing this morning?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, listen.  OK.  A couple of years ago, my ex-wife's grandfather passes away.  And through that whole little gravesite ceremony, we're sitting there looking.  And you can see the backhoe and, like, the three Mexicans standing there waiting to fill  this grave.  And they just want to get it done and over with.  Ceremony ends.  We go back to the mausoleum where they had the little wake.  They decide they want to grab flowers and go back to the gravesite and throw them down  the hole.  And I'm like, I don't think it's a good idea. 
[00:41:30]  I've been to several funerals.  I know they're probably burying them already.  No sooner do we pull up than you just see the backhoe start pushing dirt and, like,  the dry dirt just kind of whispering up in the wind.  And everybody just loses it.  And I'm sitting there next to my ex-brother-in-law.  And he is a sick son of a bitch, too.  And we're both just biting our lips trying not to laugh because we both knew what was  going to be happening there.  And they run up and they're trying to throw the flowers.  They didn't even stop.  Like, I mean, there's six people throwing flowers. 
[00:42:00]  And this dude is just picking up dirt and dumping it.  He's doing it like he's backfilling a foundation.  Yeah.  And you're trying to get a moment.  Unbelievable.  That's terrible.  Let's remember Grandpa for diesel fumes now.  Okay, great.  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Thank you, Ziggy.  Yep.  Yeah, this is a good one, too.  We'll try to move on.  We got a lot of stuff to do today.  We got Louis C.K. coming in.  We're very happy about that.  It's been a long time.  And we were able to get this done late last night. 
[00:42:30]  Seth Rogen's coming in to say hi.  Yeah.  To talk about funny people, this movie.  I was reading about funny people just last night.  And, like, it's a little more serious of a movie than Judd Apatow has done, you know,  before.  And it's also going to be really funny and, you know, down and dirty, basically.  You know what I mean?  Like, that typical humor that Judd does.  Yeah.  But he also has kind of a serious twist as well.  Really?  And they're selling it both ways, by the way. 
[00:43:00]  I guess there's two different commercials out there.  Oh, no.  Or two different previews.  That scares me.  One that goes with more of the serious angle and the other one going with all the, like,  40-year-old virgin type, you know.  Jokes.  I was going to say type shit, but when I say type shit, I meant that in a nice way.  You know what scares me about this movie?  71% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.  Well, that's not bad.  You know what scares me about this movie, though?  You know, movies about comedians are never really that good because there's actors. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there are a few movies.  Yeah, Adam Sandler.  That scares me.  Because they're actors.  And a lot of times, actors trying to play comedians, it doesn't matter how good of an actor you are,  you're not a comedian.  So it's kind of hard to...  It's a different muscle.  Yeah, yeah, comedians can do that because they're good at what they do.  Right.  Actors are good at doing acting because that's what they do.  The crossover, it's easier for a comedian to be an actor than it is for an actor to try to look on film, 
[00:44:00]  especially to film an act that looks like a natural occurring comedy act is very, very difficult to do.  Yeah.  Who did that?  Tom Hanks and Sally Field.  Tom Hanks and Sally Field.  She was horrendous.  What was that movie, Punch?  It was terrible.  Punch line?  Punch line, right, right, right.  Punch her in the face.  And Hanks was horrendous in that, too.  Yeah.  He couldn't pull it off.  Yeah, they just can't really do it.  It's...  Jonah Hill, actually, I saw an interview with him yesterday, too. 
[00:44:30]  It's all about funny people, I guess.  Yeah.  It's everywhere.  And he said when he had to become a stand-up comic for his role in the movie, and he said  at first it was easy.  I was like, wow, this is pretty easy.  And then he realized how hard it is to be a stand-up and gave stand-up comics a lot of  props.  I love the slug line on that box there.  It says, punch line, have you heard the one about Sally Field and Tom Hanks?  No.  No. 
[00:45:00]  I actually tried to watch...  Tell me.  I tried to watch that movie a few years ago.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Unwatchable.  Oh, my God.  Because even Rupert Pupkin there, you know, when he finally gets up and you finally see  De Niro doing the act.  But it's like, he only pulled it off because Rupert Pupkin was such a fucked-up character  that that would have been kind of the act that he was doing.  Right.  But, like, some of the movements he was doing, and it was old school kind of comedy.  But he had the confidence of a stand-up comic. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When Sally Field and Tom Hanks did in Punchline, they were so uncomfortable in their skin, and  they weren't supposed to...  I don't think their characters were supposed to be that uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Why are we talking about Punchline?  No one has seen this movie.  Punchline, because it's the only, like, comedian movie that don't have comedians in it.  Well, ask Seth Rogen about it around 8 o'clock, I think.  8, 8, 15.  Uh, Jared, what do you got, buddy?  Wow.  Hey, guys.  No, it's funny.  We had every phone lit.  We started talking about Punchline, and we just go...  We see him go, and disappear. 
[00:46:00]  Boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink.  What do you got, Jared?  Hey.  Hi, Anthony.  You'll probably appreciate this one.  I was probably no older than 10, and my grandfather died.  I didn't really know him all that well.  We looked kind of far away.  But, uh, so we went out for the funeral, and, uh, he was a military guy, full career on thing, active, you know, after the war and all that stuff.  Uh, he was a general.  So they had the full, huge military honors.  Uh, they had the case on.  You know, they had the horse with the boots backwards, the full, uh, the honor guard and everything, the rifle squad. 
[00:46:30]  They had a flyover and everything.  It was like, it was like a movie.  It was the coolest thing ever.  Mm, very cool.  See, now that's a funeral.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's the way to do it.  Yeah, you know, and I'm a fan of just trying to, trying to do it different than everyone else has.  Like, when I got married, I tried to do it that way.  You know, I don't want the same old, same old.  And I don't think that's a money thing either.  I think you could get very creative with some of this stuff and make it different.  You just don't want the, the agony, the agony that people get put through is, is unnecessary. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And you don't want the agony to be something that sticks in your head forever and ever.  Because that is, um, just horrid.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  Uh, someone has a very good question here.  Um, Dan in Middle Island, talking about stand-up comedy movies.  Dan?  Morning, boys.  Hi, Dan.  Yeah, I was just wondering what you thought about that movie.  Um, what, the, uh, uh, Man on the Moon? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman.  I can't, I don't know, I, I haven't really talked about this a lot, but I'm a huge Andy  Kaufman fan.  So it was really tough for me to see anyone play Andy Kaufman.  But I think Jim Carrey, you know, was very believable as Andy Kaufman.  He pulled it off.  Also, Andy Kaufman wasn't your standard stand-up comic.  So when he did parts of his act, it wasn't, uh, like he was just trying to be a, uh, a  generic stand-up comic.  He was, he was acting like Andy Kaufman.  It was also a biography of him not on stage. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  And Jim Carrey was a stand-up.  Right.  So he knows what it's like to be on stage and, uh, and actually be a stand-up comic.  They made it to, uh, the movie was too Hollywood.  I wish they made it, I wish they made it a little more gritty and a little more underground.  They were just going for a mass audience, which I guess you gotta.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I think he did pretty good.  It was okay.  I, I, I wasn't blown away by the movie, but it was all right.  I was, I, I stopped at a Brewer show on Friday. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And I, I gave him my Andy Kaufman theory.  I should say it on our own show.  Theory?  Well, you know how everyone's like, he faked his own death.  Oh my God.  Andy Kaufman, he's still alive somewhere.  Coming back in 80 years.  If you know anything about Andy Kaufman, he was always trying to, you know, fuck with  the audience, obviously, and fuck with his friends and everybody around him.  I, I believe he knew he was going to die before anyone else, obviously.  And then went, well, this is what, you know, then started telling people, I'm going to fake  my own death.  Yeah.  Like, I think he knew he was going to die way before everyone else knew. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, way before.  So the gag isn't faking his own death.  The gag is to put it in your head like he faked his own death.  Right.  He knew he was going to die and said, you know what?  I'm going to die.  This is going to be my last, you know, my last trick that I do to my, my fans and everybody  else.  And my.  Leave that element of doubt in their head.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And it's simple as that.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Cause people are like, well, I was at a party and Andy Kaufman, you know, sat me down and  said he was going to fake his own death.  And, and there's a lot of those stories.  It's like, okay, yeah, but the, the, the missing piece of the puzzle is, Andy knew that 
[00:49:30]  he was going to die beforehand before he let the world know he was going to die.  Hmm.  End of theory.  Want to take a break?  Sure.  We got to get into the horse fucker story.  Yeah.  And then Danny just writes best nine one call ever.  Nine one.  Did I say nine one?  Yeah.  Your boy, you'd be waiting.  You'd be waiting a while.  You're on a roll today.  Nine one one.  I've had some funny lines though.  In between my mispronunciations. 
[00:50:00]  No, it says best nine one one call ever.  That's a bold statement, Danny.  It is.  Made me laugh.  That's some good ones.  A few times in the, in the back office this morning.  And for, for five in the morning, it's, it's hard to get some chuckles.  And then I'm like, Danny, why is it the best one?  And then he goes, oh, you just got to play it.  I don't even want to tell you.  He called rescue nine one.  And no one showed up.  I was watching a Lane Staley, Alice in Chains videos, like for hours yesterday.  Yeah.  Can we play nutshell today?  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  And I think, and I think it kind of like ties into the whole, like, like a funeral thing. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Travis, could you get nutshell by Alice in Chains?  You want the original or the unplugged?  No, it has to go unplugged.  Okay.  Has to.  That's one of the best unplugs ever.  Although, you know what?  If you're an Alice in Chains fan, nutshell is my favorite song by far.  And Alice in Chains had a million great songs, but then all the people covering nutshell on  YouTube, holy shit.  Is there some talent out there?  It's worth checking out. 
[00:51:00]  Really?  I think so.  And then I ended with Aaron Lewis's version.  You know, the dude from Stained.  Stained?  Yeah.  He does an amazing job with Nutshell as well, but we'll do the original today.  I didn't know so many people covered it.  Oh, yeah.  And doing a pretty good job with it, too, because it's not an easy song.  No.  Hit it, Travis.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Right on.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Radio dial.  Wow.  Everybody is writing.  You guys have to address, and when I mean everybody, three people, Wichita, South Carolina, 
[00:51:30]  and Honolulu, you guys have to address Jimmy's phone message, eating his own cum.  Oh.  And also, there's a blown home run call from last night if the boys want to check that  out.  Cardinals-Dodgers game.  Oh, I definitely want to hear that.  Might be worth playing.  We like the blown home run calls.  And, by the way, fuck Joan Rivers.  In her where?  In her shitter.  Right.  In her dirty shitter.  In her old dirty shitter. 
[00:52:00]  Which might make Jimmy bummed, but you know what?  She's taking shots at Jay Leno.  She's doing a, I guess they roasted Joan Rivers, but she said that they're not allowed to go  after Melissa Rivers.  My daughter is off limits.  She's an old school comedian.  She should understand what a roast is, and if she doesn't want to play by the rules,  then you shouldn't be roasted.  Yeah.  What, a comic can't get up there and say that she's a worthless, leech, piece of shit daughter?  Well, that's what led to her saying, fuck you, and walking out of a TV interview, my friend. 
[00:52:30]  Well.  And I'm right there with you.  Excuse me.  With you.  Melissa Rivers would not have a career if it wasn't for her mom.  Simple as that.  Has she now made something of herself?  Yes.  What?  But when she first started.  What has she made of herself?  Well, nothing.  I don't know what she does.  The fashion thing.  Nothing we would give a shit about.  But at first, I mean, Joan Rivers completely carried her.  Completely.  And the only reason she was on TV was because it was Joan Rivers' daughter. 
[00:53:00]  Yep.  And Joan doesn't want to accept that?  No.  Are you kidding me?  Let people make fun of her.  No one gets a break like that.  She certainly wouldn't give one.  Who?  Joan wouldn't give a break like that to somebody.  Oh, no.  At a roast, if they had a kid that was the same circumstance of kind of your mom pushing you into show business or whatever, she'd be all over it.  I've lost a bunch of respect for Joan Rivers.  For real.  Yeah.  I mean, because she takes on everybody and isn't shy to say what she's thinking. 
[00:53:30]  And she's gotten in trouble over the years.  Good trouble, though.  It's a good kind of trouble.  And then to tell everyone, if you're going to roast me, you can't go after my daughter.  Leave her alone.  She's been through enough.  You've got to be kidding me.  With my husband Edgar's suicide, she's been through enough.  Can you make fun of Edgar?  Probably.  Really?  She wouldn't mind that?  I bet you probably not.  A bunch of little booze bottle jokes or something.  I bet you the guys didn't go that way either.  Yeah.  So this is what Joan Rivers did, I think, two days ago now. 
[00:54:00]  Did you ever run up to someone and say, hey, how did you get so rich?  And the woman said, by writing on my mom's coattails.  And you said, Melissa, this is my show.  I don't think so.  And I think we're going to end the interview right now.  Don't get so fucking smart.  We'll apologize for Joan's language right there at the end.  You're just trying to be funny with her.  And I had no idea that she would do that.  We apologize for that this morning, right?  Wow.  I did not expect her to go there at all.  And the guy goes, look, we're just trying to, you know, we're just having fun here, goofing around. 
[00:54:30]  I like how, you know, we've gotten so petrified that the first thing she did, we want to apologize.  Oh, yeah.  The K came out.  I think it was live.  It had to be live.  Yeah.  The K was barely out of Joan's mouth.  And she's already apologizing.  Please, I need this gig.  Oh, good God.  We didn't know she was going to do that.  Holy shit.  And the best part of that is how they're laughing, like, we're just joking it up and everything. 
[00:55:00]  And then they realize that, uh-oh, Joan's not finding this funny.  Uh-oh, we apologize.  Yeah, but they didn't back down with quick sorries and stuff.  They're like, whoa, we were just trying to have fun.  No, no, no.  They apologize for the language.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's with Joan.  Yeah, exactly.  Jordan from Scranton.  Fuck Joan Rivers and her dusty, surgically reconstructed shitter.  Right.  Yeah, I lost a lot of respect.  And then in the paper, she's making fun of Jay Leno and saying something like, have you ever heard anyone say, did you hear what Jay Leno said last night?  Yes.  And to come out and say that Jay Leno's not funny, what's wrong with you? 
[00:55:30]  The news occasionally plays as shit.  But that goes back.  Yeah, of course.  It's not an accurate statement.  And that goes back to because Joan Rivers was dissed because she took a show at Fox.  I am.  So she ended up not getting along with Johnny Carson at the end of his career.  And then it bled over into Leno because he took over for Carson.  Yeah.  You know.  Would she think she was going to get that gig?  Let the guys fucking make fun of your daughter.  She's a multi-millionaire, I'm sure. 
[00:56:00]  I think she could take it.  I think she could handle it.  All right.  So that was a quickie.  We got Jim's voicemail.  Jim's going to be back tomorrow for a day.  And then I think he goes back and films more of the movie.  Slacker.  He's going to be in a movie.  Jimmy's a slacker.  He's going to be in a movie with Brooke Shields.  Oh.  It's pretty good.  Brendan Fraser.  Brendan Fraser.  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice.  Yeah.  Tricky.  Yeah.  What does he play?  I don't know.  What's the movie about?  He's been top secret. 
[00:56:30]  He's being very mysterious.  Why don't we just punch it up on Internet Movie Database and see what the fuck this is about?  Yeah, we'll learn more about this.  Because Jimmy never says what the movie's about.  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe you know how he thinks.  He doesn't want to jinx it or something.  I know, that's what it is.  He doesn't want to jinx it, but we could jinx it.  I want to find out what this is about.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Joan Rivers was much funnier before the autopsy.  Maybe this one's better.  I can't eat now.  See, they fucked it up.  They fucked me all up.  We'll go short here so we could eat. 
[00:57:00]  I'll just pop this in.  They hate when we eat on the air.  I know.  I try not to, but there are times where I'm just staring at this thing like a dog.  I think it's more distracting to just stare at it in hunger than it is to just eat the fucking thing.  I go crazy.  I go crazy.  I go crazy.  Yeah.  Do we find out what this is about?  Brendan Fraser.  Brendan Fraser.  Brooke Shields.  Look at it in the Internet Movie Database.  See what movie they're together in and find out what this is about.  I know the movie's called...  You know what Travai knows? 
[00:57:30]  I know the movie's called Fuzzy Vengeance.  Fuzzy Vengeance.  Yeah.  Okay, there it is.  Give me the synopsis there, Travai.  By the way, you were very good with Ben yesterday.  I sure thought so.  You were good, too.  Although you did.  Although you were totally staring at him like a creep.  I looked over at one point, and you were staring at him like, I can't believe I'm sitting this close to him.  I was probably just in awe of you.  Oh, thank you.  And it looked like I was staring.  It's Kiss Anthony's ass day.  You know what? 
[00:58:00]  Look, I was an observer during the interview.  Let me tell you what was going on.  I know what's going on.  You both wanted to lap some ass.  The guy...  You guys were ridiculous.  The guy that called me a fanboy?  100% correct.  I was gushing.  And I blew it, because I'm filming all over the place these days.  I wish I filmed you staring at him, which Anthony's right about.  Yeah, creepily staring at him.  And then Anthony giving his best smile after the interview for his picture.  I'm like, oh my God. 
[00:58:30]  You're over his shoulder like impending doom.  You would have done the same thing if you watched Lost.  Yeah, true.  I got some tough competition out there, because I threw down the challenge.  I will be the last human being on Earth to watch Lost.  Well, it's a terrible goal.  Yeah, it is.  It's an awful goal to have.  It's a great goal.  I got some stiff competition, and they're attacking me on Twitter.  But trust me, in the end, I win.  I'll be the only human being to eat shit.  That's like saying that.  Why would you want to?  It's out there. 
[00:59:00]  It's Lost.  It's just to get all the seasons before the last season, start watching it, and then by  the time the last season comes up, you're caught up.  You're hooked.  I'm not saying that I'm not going to watch Lost.  I just want to be the last human being to do so.  To do it.  And I got some trickery for all those people that think they're going to outlast me.  You don't think there's some kid in Africa somewhere with a big bloated belly and flies  around their head that probably won't see Lost?  Who knows? 
[00:59:30]  Maybe one of those do-gooders will roll up a black-and-white TV for the youngster with  an episode of Lost on it.  I don't know.  With a bunch of Patriots championship shirts.  Season 10 shirts.  I'm in this for the long haul, man.  I'll last everybody.  Now, has there been anyone that's come in here that you have kind of gushed over like  that?  I'm trying to think.  I would assume there would have to be with this many years in radio. 
[01:00:00]  Because I go in there.  There was another one.  You're more...  Me?  It was George Carlin.  I get all gushy.  Fuck.  Who else?  That really freaked me out.  You know what?  I have to think about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I was like, all right.  All right.  I know I do that.  And I just find it fun because I'm like, ooh.  Dude.  Ooh, I love this.  You're like on a show I watch.  I'm an asshole.  You just heard me fanboying about Alice in Chains and Lane Staley. 
[01:00:30]  I never got to meet Lane Staley.  Yeah.  We've met Jerry Cantrell and Sean a bunch of times.  If he...  Obviously, it ain't happening anytime soon.  Yeah.  But if Lane Staley was on our show, oh my God, I would have lost my fucking mind.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  Kurt Cobain, I would have lost my fucking mind.  Like Chris Cornell, I become fanboy.  Chris Cornell.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  Yeah, I become fanboy with Chris Cornell.  I also became Mila Jovovich.  I was completely just fucking... 
[01:01:00]  She's coming in tomorrow.  I know.  I know.  And she was a great guest.  Remember, she fell off the chair.  She was laughing so hard.  She fell off her chair.  She was laughing.  I hope she remembers us.  Mila.  Yeah, I totally was gushing fanboy over her.  Little Shawnee Smith.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're more of a TV guy.  I'm more of a music guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Chris Cornell is a biggie for me.  That whole grunge thing for me, I don't know what it was.  But I was hooked.  And he's so handsome.  Hooked, hooked on the whole grunge thing.  What about Locke?  John Locke was...  Yeah, when he came in. 
[01:01:30]  That was crazy.  I'm trying to think anybody in TV that really blew me away.  Yeah.  Well, when we were on Letterman, that was like, wow.  Yeah.  That's fucking David Letterman.  It sure is different being on the show, though.  Yeah.  I mean, when you've got to interview a person coming in here...  It's easier if they're in our environment.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we can control it way better.  But it was...  You know, it was also kind of...  I wasn't a gushing fanboy, but it was pretty cool, was Richard Dreyfuss.  Really?  To have him in.  Because it was just because... 
[01:02:00]  That's a good one.  Because it's Richard Dreyfuss.  I mean, you know, some of my favorite movies, Jaws, Close Encounters.  Right.  You know, that's just...  Shatner had it.  Yeah, Shatner too.  Shatner was a biggie for you.  Shatner's huge for me.  And the good thing about William Shatner being in the studio, I can be the gushing fanboy  and it becomes part of the bit.  Because he's just calmed down.  Right.  Calmed down it.  Me, it's comedians and musicians.  Yeah.  So like when I met Sam Kinison, holy mother of God.  Yeah, it's a...  That was a biggie for me. 
[01:02:30]  That's a biggie.  That was a biggie.  Yeah.  I'll think of others.  I'm trying to think of one in TV or movies that really got to me.  I can't remember all the people.  We're lucky.  We've had hundreds and hundreds of people.  We've had so many goddamn people in and out of this.  I'd have to go look at my pictures.  I'll get back to you on that.  Absolutely.  Steve the Whistler?  Steve the Whistler.  I remember you were just gushing.  Oh, God.  I still...  Top 10 favorite bits of all time for me.  Dude, I can't listen to that without just cringing and laughing. 
[01:03:00]  And I told you, I walk past him every once in a while because he lives in the neighborhood.  Does he?  I can't even look at him.  I don't even want him to know it's me.  I just look down and go, oh, that's Steve the Whistler.  With his douchey whistling CD with him on the cover with leaning against his car.  It just looked like a piece of Long Island or Jersey trash.  Oh, Ed Asner was a biggie for me.  Yeah, that is a biggie.  Yeah, he's calling him the destroyer, of course.  The wire guys were big, but there wasn't one main focus.  Well, the one guy I would have lost my mind over, I was sick that day. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  It was Omar.  Omar, yeah.  That would have been big.  I would have lost my mind if I got to hang with Omar.  You got Steve the Whistler on his car picture.  Leave it to Danny.  He's collecting so many pictures on the desktop, it's hard to find the ones he's downloading.  Steve the Whistler is one of my favorite bits we've ever done.  And his license plate is W-H-I-S-T-L-R.  Whistler. 
[01:04:00]  He deserved everything we gave him.  He's on the back of an Aurora.  It's an Oldsmobile.  It's an Oldsmobile.  With vanity plates.  With vanity plates.  And he's wearing what could be the worst sweater I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah.  It's a multicolored, almost a Indian blanket look to it.  It looks like he's wearing fire.  It should be.  I was going to say it looks like somebody vomited Sherbert.  What a douche. 
[01:04:30]  Chaz Palminteri.  That was pretty big.  That was pretty big as far as actors go, but not a gushing big.  Chaz made me look like a fucking rock star.  Did I ever tell the story?  No.  You left my wedding a little early, so we're hanging.  Very important things to do.  Lose tons of money.  It's safe to say now I got married at the Ritz-Carlton in Philly, and we had a great wedding, as you know.  And near the end, all of a sudden, Kenny goes, come on, fast, fast, fast. 
[01:05:00]  You and Lindsay.  You and Lindsay.  Follow me.  Follow me.  And in front of, like, everybody, Chaz Palminteri walks into the main room to congratulate me and Lindsay.  In front of all my relatives, all the ones that think I'm a...  Oh, fuck, didn't I hear that?  I never told you.  Wow.  And in front of all my relatives.  And I know half of them think I'm a piece of shit because of the type of radio we do.  But that moment made them all go, wow.  Go, Opie knows someone that looks just like Chaz Palminteri. 
[01:05:30]  Even the ones that don't want to ever give me an inch in my family about what I do, they were even like, whoa.  That is impressive.  They were impressive.  I go, that's right, fuckers.  Stop asking me for money if you don't like me.  Louie, bang.  Oh, Ron Howard.  There you go.  That was...  I was out of my skin.  That was about...  Okay.  I did see that.  Because my whole life revolves around his name from, you know, his old name.  I definitely saw that.  And I have now made my own.  Steve the Whistler. 
[01:06:00]  Steve the Whistler.  Broadway and Beyond.  I guess it's a new album.  Broadway and Beyond.  He whistles Broadway tunes, I guess.  Oof.  You know what?  What a useless talent this guy has.  You want to hear an excerpt?  What do you got?  Well, Danny Boy, St. Louis.  No, he's got all these.  Turkish Rondo.  Turkish Rondo.  Do the Star Spangled Banner because it's got to be a song that everyone knows.  The Star Spangled Banner whistled?  Yeah, this is Steve the Whistler, everyone. 
[01:06:30]  Hopefully it works.  One of our favorite guests of all time.  For all the wrong reasons.  Yeah.  Because he sucked an ass.  His mouth looked like an asshole puckered up.  Oh, Quentin Tarantino.  Tarantino.  Mother of God.  That was a biggie.  That was a biggie, too.  See, the listeners have to remind us of the big ones.  They know.  What about Ray Liotta?  Ray Liotta was pretty big.  He's sitting right there.  Yeah, when he did the laugh, it was like, holy shit, that's Ray Liotta laugh. 
[01:07:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, Steve the Whistler.  Please take your hats off and rise.  Boo!  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, God, this is terrible.  Every dog is twisting its head right now. 
[01:07:30]  How does he think this is good?  Or that anyone wants to hear it?  It's almost over.  Everybody who's listening that has a dog, tell me what your dog is doing during this,  because it's got to be freaking out, twisting its head, doing that cute dog thing.  Oh, here it comes.  I want to hear Home of the Brits.  Yeah, it's coming.  Where's that cursor?  Oh, fuck, we got a ways to go. 
[01:08:00]  Jesus.  He slows it down with you.  Here it comes.  High note.  High note.  Barely got that one up.  Got enough reverb on that douche?  And a big tomato hits him in the face right when he's finishing.  Ladies and gentlemen, Steve the Whistler.  Can we play our old Steve the Whistler bit sometime in the near future? 
[01:08:30]  Just put it as...  Our trombone says his dog is now licking his ass.  We've got to play Steve the Whistler as part of the Countdown show this week.  Yeah, yeah, that one.  Even though we didn't even do it this week.  Yeah, that's in there somehow.  A little nostalgia.  Yeah.  E-Rock's biggest fanboy moment happens every morning when Opie gets to work.  That's John C. from Chile.  Writing from South America.  Look at that.  Ooh.  And we want to say hi to Bill in Tennessee. 
[01:09:00]  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Hey, what about the guy that did the toothpick art that just squirted the mustard on the...  Allegedly, on the Oriental guy.  On the little Asian gentleman leaving the building.  You know, now that we're out of that building...  Oriental guy.  Now that we're out of the building, we can give all the details of that.  Yeah.  First of all, the toothpick guy was my biggest disappointment ever because I was this close  to smashing his stupid toothpick art and I just didn't do it.  And I was mad at myself that day. 
[01:09:30]  And that's why when he left the building, I was shooting mustard out the...  How many floors up?  Yeah, I was shooting mustard last night.  How many floors up?  Five, six?  About five, yeah.  Shooting mustard at the guy as he was fleeing the building.  Yeah.  That's always good when a guest of our show is running out of the building.  He actually grabbed up his stuff and fled the building.  Yeah, so I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to get this guy.  So I was spraying mustard out the window and it landed on an Asian gentleman just trying  to get to work.  He was covered with mustard.  And from that moment on, they were trying to figure out why this guy was covered in 
[01:10:00]  mustard because he couldn't figure it out.  Why would mustard come from the sky?  He wasn't sure.  It doesn't make sense.  But he wasn't sure.  Did that just come from the sky?  Was it the building that I go to work at every morning?  Something I got on me during breakfast.  And then we have to ride the elevator with the guy every once in a while.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable.  He had no idea that we were...  Looks a little big in that dress today.  Oh, you're not as lonely today.  A little big.  Not as lonely, huh?  No.  Maybe she's got a baby in that belly. 
[01:10:30]  No, it's bloating.  Bloating?  Oh, I heard it all.  Oh, boy.  What?  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Why do you turn into Bobo?  Oh, this guy...  Hold on.  Before we move on.  From Steve the Whistler and Anthony's Loneliness.  James in Pennsylvania.  James.  Yeah, hey.  Y'all playing that Steve the Whistler thing. 
[01:11:00]  And right as Anthony mentioned that everybody's got a dog, I've got Jack Russell sitting on  the seat next to me in the truck.  And she started growling at the radio.  Growling at the radio?  Growling at the radio.  Too bad you can't get your dog to bite off a testicle of Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  Just start gnawing at one of those bad boys.  He actually thought we were interviewing him.  He actually thought we gave a piece of a flying fuck that he whistled songs.  God, it's one of my favorites of all time.  The uncomfortableness, the ridiculousness of the whole thing. 
[01:11:30]  That all came together nice that day.  Oh, it was perfect.  I was so embarrassed.  Danny's finding...  I'm reading his bio.  Danny in the middle just goes, what?  Because he's so full of himself.  He whistles.  He really is.  This is the last paragraph of his bio that's on his official website, stevethewistler.com.  Yeah.  Pedestrians in the crowded streets of Manhattan have been known to follow him for blocks,  a la the Pied Piper, drawn by his music.  That is such complete and utter bullshit. 
[01:12:00]  No one is doing that.  I hope people are following you to mug you.  And then there's a picture of him at 13 months old, whistling.  Well, there's a question mark because it just looks that way.  Yeah.  He could be going, what the fuck am I going to do when I'm older?  And he's got the what part.  You know what?  You should take him on.  Yeah.  Mono.  Mono.  Oh.  Mono.  How's that?  Yes.  Mono-y-mono?  Mono-y-mono. 
[01:12:30]  The Toodly-doo King taking on Steve the Whistler.  Mono-y-mono-y-mono.  Mono-y-mono.  Toodly-doo-ly.  Toodly-do.  Mono-y-mono.  Mono-y-mono.  Toodly-doo.  Mono-y-do-ly-do.  Mono-y-mono-y-mono.  Mono-y-mono-y-mono.  Take on Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler. 
[01:13:00]  You'll be known as.  Anthony the Toodly-do-er.  Well, you've got to say kid in there.  It's Tootly-Doo Kid.  I'm the Tootly-Doo Kid.  Yeah, taking on Steve the Whistler.  We should pack out some dumb fucking place.  Pack it out.  Have Steve the Whistler in you.  There's a picture of him now in the woods with the same shit on that he had on the back of his bad aurora.  That's one of those cheap photo shoots.  You hire a photographer.  They go, hey, wait till fall.  We'll go in the woods.  We'll take some fine pictures that he can hang up on your wall. 
[01:13:30]  Should have left him in a shallow grave.  Worthless.  Terrible.  All right, so Jim Norton's doing a movie.  He'll be back tomorrow.  And he's been leaving voicemails for everybody, which is very nice.  The first one, meeting Brendan Fraser.  Hey, it's me.  I'm in my honey wagon, as they call us, back on the set.  We had a late call today because we got called at 5.50 yesterday morning.  And because of the sun, they wanted to shoot us, but the sun was just too bright.  We wanted to be shot.  So we didn't start shooting until after 5 that night, about last night. 
[01:14:00]  So today I got in, and me and Patrice sat down and had lunch.  And Brendan Fraser sat down with us.  I think we had a scene together.  And he's actually a really nice dude.  Tough crowd fan, it turns out.  So we're all talking.  And I'm such a fucking nervous Nelly.  And I ran out of things to say, and I panicked.  So I just started talking about Crash, like uncomfortably so.  Because I loved it.  I just kept saying, like, what about Don Sheila?  How great was he to work with?  And then Alex said, who are you guys against that?  You won the Oscar.  Did we surprise you won the Oscar? 
[01:14:30]  It was fucking embarrassing.  He finally just looked straight ahead.  Like I had just confessed a childhood rape.  And I made everyone uncomfortable.  And I crashed.  I just fucking completely weasel.  And I did good for a while.  Patrice was so disgusted.  He finally just got up and left the table.  And I'm just sitting there with Brendan Fraser.  And as soon as Patrice got up, you could see Brendan just wanted to get up and leave with him.  But I just ruined everything.  Imagine we're just sitting there googly-eyed.  Jimmy's complete lack of confidence in anything he does.  As he's doing a movie. 
[01:15:00]  I know.  That's what amazes me.  Yeah.  No confidence as he's sitting doing a movie with Brendan Fraser, Brooke Shields, Patrice  O'Neill.  Supposedly Dick Van Dykes in the movie someone was writing.  Really?  Yep.  It's a biggie.  This thing could be a big thing for Jim Norton.  I would have talked about The Mummy.  Or Encino Man.  Encino Man.  When you were doing Encino Man.  You think he likes when people bring that up?  No.  No?  Hates it, I bet.  Talking to Brooke Shields. 
[01:15:30]  To me again.  Well, it's about 6.54 a.m.  And I've just been driving back to the hotel from the set.  They're doing what they call covering the set today because of rain.  It's fucking shitty Boston weather.  So, the first day we shot literally for five minutes after 12 hours of waiting.  Today, yesterday, we didn't shoot at all after six hours.  And today it looks like rain.  I think what was happening is those two nice days, they were trying to squeeze all of Brendan's 
[01:16:00]  and Brooke's stuff in because they finally had daylight.  Like sunlight, they've had shitty weather.  So, that kind of makes sense.  Me and Patrice were waiting because they were shooting the bigger scene.  And I was talking to Brooke in the kitchen.  And she said she had a charity event in Texas, so they probably knew they had a schedule with  her.  At least that's what Brooke told me.  You know, I don't know.  Well, who knows?  You know, just these crazy Hollywood types.  All right, well, so I'm just going to sit in my hotel and eat eggs and fucking just look  at myself in the mirror. 
[01:16:30]  What a fucking pig I've been eating like.  Little fat piggy boy eating ice cream on the set.  Special treat.  So, I'm always thinking I'm on a set.  It won't go right to my tits and hips.  I'm like a fucking girl.  I'm just having a weekend away with the girls.  I'm like a housewife.  The husbands are always fishing and me and the gals are eating.  You're eating.  It's too fucking much, man.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Goddamn Jimmy.  And I think this is the one everyone's talking about today.  This next one and the last one from Jim Norton. 
[01:17:00]  From the set of Fuzzy Vengeance.  Hi, it's me again.  I don't know how I forgot this, but I ate my own cum for the first time last night.  I just...  All right.  What?  Boo!  He's on a movie set.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's on a movie set.  This degenerate is on a movie set.  How about you wait until you're not on a movie set to do that?  He's got like a real part.  Right.  And what is he doing eating his own cum?  Hi, it's me again. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know how I forgot this, but I ate my own cum for the first time last night.  I just...  Young lady had requested that I do it.  I'd always been kind of shy about it.  And I was just feeling kind of dirty.  So I put on the old Mac cam.  She couldn't see it.  I just videotaped it.  And boy, oh boy, you should have...  What a little licky-loo I turned into on the old fingers.  Odd taste.  And this, by the way, this is not about plugging the Manhattan Comedy Club tonight in Middletown. 
[01:18:00]  I mean, tomorrow and Saturday.  Ah, it's not important.  You know, 845-346-4242.  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  Who gives a shit about that?  This is about me eating my own cum out of my hand.  It's an odd feeling to do something like that.  It's kind of hot in the moment.  Like, I know she's going to like this.  And it doesn't taste that bad.  I am happy to report.  But the aftertaste is horrendous.  Horrendous.  So all you girls out there who have lied and go, yeah, I'll tell you. 
[01:18:30]  And I didn't.  Apologies all around.  Yuck.  That was fucking brutal.  It's just the whole back of your throat is numb.  I don't know why I just decided to do it.  And I kind of felt like a silly goose.  Yep.  The kid ate his own cum for the first time in 41 years.  Yay, me.  He's out of his fucking mind.  They're going to kick him off the set.  There are certain things.  Make sure Brooke Shields doesn't find out about this.  I hope that wasn't the girl that was telling him to do it. 
[01:19:00]  Eat your own cum.  Out of your own hand.  I don't get it.  I got to say, the closest I've ever even come to that was, come to that was, you have sex.  Shoot your load.  You wait a little while.  You're all sexed up.  Go down on the chick for a little bit.  Holy mother of God.  Not sticking.  Now, hold the phone.  Hold the phone.  Hold the phone.  Hold the phone.  Holy mother of God.  Hold the phone.  Hold the phone.  Yes. 
[01:19:30]  Not sticking your tongue inside, but just licking the clitoris.  What about the leakage?  Well, that's just it.  What about the?  It could be a little leakage.  Yeah.  But it's gravity kind of.  It backs up.  And the girl kind of cleans up first.  You know, but, but there is a little, um, you know, something there that ain't girl.  You know, I'm not sucking anything out with a straw.  Right.  But, uh, you just kind of know there's a weird taste going, ah, but you're in the moment. 
[01:20:00]  You're all sexed up and you're going to jam it in and leave some more.  For a guy that doesn't want to have kids.  You take a lot of chances, my friend.  Huh?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Nah.  Oh, here we go.  I like the pill.  Pill or pull.  That's my fucking logic.  That's your motto?  The pill or the pull.  Ah.  Hmm.  So, Norton will be back tomorrow. 
[01:20:30]  We're going to have to get into that tomorrow with him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I want details.  Seth Rogen's coming in soon, but we want to squeeze a couple things in before that.  Yeah.  Fucking Obama is drinking what you drink, my friend.  Yes.  Bud Light.  Are you a Bud Light guy or a Bud guy?  What's the tap?  I'll drink either.  The tap, though, is Bud Light.  Bud Light.  So, you and Obama finally have something in common.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's our common ground.  We'll see how much you hate Obama.  Are you going to change beers now?  Bud Light.  Well, I was thinking of changing the tap. 
[01:21:00]  It's easy because I can just put any keg I want in there, really.  Knowing you, you're going to change.  It doesn't really matter.  Is Budweiser losing your business because of Obama's choice of beer?  No.  They're calling it the Beer Summit?  The Beer Summit.  No, it's not that bad.  I, you know, he has some good points.  You understand?  Some people are like, why'd you get Bud Light?  That's like water.  It's like, no, it isn't, first of all.  I like the taste of it.  And when it's nice and hot out and you're just hanging out outside. 
[01:21:30]  I'd love to hear about beer, but they're calling you the snowball kid at this point.  No, I wasn't snowballing.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  No.  And everyone else saying you have officially did some, what is it, felching or whatever?  No, not felching.  No, no, no.  There wasn't gobs of jizz.  So you don't want them to call you the snowball kid?  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  There wasn't gobs of jizz.  I love how these fuckers take a little thing and make it.  Oh, and just, yeah.  Boy, I wonder where they learned that from. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, blow it completely out of proportion.  I wonder where they learned that from.  Where did that come from?  I don't know.  They've got crazy minds of their own.  All right, beer.  The beer summit.  Yeah, but the beer is like, you know, on a hot day, Bud Light is good because it's just,  it's like drinking, you know, lemonade outside.  You can just keep downing them and it's cool and refreshing.  Good light beer on a hot summer day.  And then Guinness is good for at night when you're hanging out.  Or the fall or winter.  What's wrong with you?  Just wait.  I don't like that. 
[01:22:30]  Well, no, I can't because now the Bud Light tap emptied out last night, so I had to go  to the case.  I had to.  And what did we say yesterday?  They were going to hack this shit up.  The beer summit, if you haven't noticed, they're doing like a red, white, and blue thing,  even though Bud Light isn't white, by the way.  Yeah.  Because you got the red stripe for what?  The professor.  Professor Gates.  Right?  Yeah.  And then you got the Blue Moon, which I told you a while ago, is Sergeant Crowley's beer  of choice.  Yeah.  And then Obama with the Bud Light. 
[01:23:00]  And they're going to be drinking on that picnic table outside the White House.  So why are they calling it red, white, and blue?  Because it's red stripe.  Well, they got the red and they got the blue, so they just said, ah, red, white, and blue.  Yeah, Bud Light is not.  It's red.  It's a red label.  So.  Because white people like it?  I don't know.  But they're calling it red, white, and blue.  Oh, okay.  That's a little bit of a stretch.  This thing is going to be so horrendous to follow.  When is it going down?  Today?  Oh, it's today.  Oh, we're going to have some fun with this tomorrow. 
[01:23:30]  Today's the day.  I guarantee you we're going to have some shit to talk about tomorrow.  I hope for drunk and belligerent where bottles go flying across heads and racial epithets  are thrown around.  Yeah.  Yes, on the White House lawn.  Where the professor and the cop have to be escorted off the property.  Hell in rule.  And thrown off onto Pennsylvania Avenue.  And we got the latest on that whole thing.  A Boston cop was suspended after racist outbursts.  What the fuck was this guy thinking?  During the, you know. 
[01:24:00]  This sort of plays right into Gates' hands.  Yes.  I mean, it sort of does.  We're just having the beer summit.  My God.  Right.  Well, on the eve of the beer summit, Boston police said they had suspended an officer  for a racist email likely to renew tensions over the recent arrest of black Harvard professor  Henry Louis Gates.  Boston police commissioner Ed Davis placed officer Justin Barrett, 36, on administrative  leave pending the outcome of a termination hearing.  Oh, boy.  The email describes Gates, who was arrested and briefly detained earlier this month at 
[01:24:30]  Harvard near Boston, as a, and I quote, banana-eating jungle monkey.  He did not say that.  In an email.  Wow.  Not with his friends in a car with the windows up.  In an email.  To who?  The city's mayor, Tom Menino, was quoted, referring to Burt as, yeah, as a, yeah, exactly.  Cancer in the department and calling on him to be fucking fired.  Here's the cancer in the department. 
[01:25:00]  Can we get Menino's statement?  Where's Menino's quote?  We got to get that all.  I want to hear him say that.  What?  Department.  Why would this guy, in this day and age, why would you leave a paper trail?  What's wrong with you?  Yes.  Keep your racial epithets to yourself.  You know people think it, but you don't write it in an email.  Terrible.  What's he doing?  This really fucked up, uh, fucked up, uh, the situation.  Ah, yeah.  The email allegedly written by Barrett Lambast Gates for getting into an altercation with police. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not a racist, but I'm prejudiced towards people who are stupid, reads the alleged diatribe.  He has indeed transcended back to a bumbling jungle monkey.  Who did he send it to?  It was one of his other quotes there.  Uh, I don't know.  Like, why would, like, who could you send that to?  And if you do send it to somebody, wouldn't you trust enough that they wouldn't send it  out and make it public?  Reply to all.  Yeah.  Oops.  I see.  I hit reply to all.  Oops. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, it's a long email.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  I don't feel like reading this whole thing right now.  You got to be.  Black Nats.  Oh my God.  This guy.  This guy really went to town, huh?  Yeah.  Uh, whatever.  That was my, uh, whatever.  Okay.  There you go.  So, so the beer summit happens tonight.  Yeah.  Can't wait.  Going to be at the picnic table still?  Huh?  Going to be at the picnic table still?  Absolutely.  You think one of them will have their leg up on the, Obama will be in shorts, he'll put 
[01:26:30]  his leg up on the table and his ball bag will hang out as they're just swigging down  some beers, looking awkwardly.  It's going to be horrible to watch.  Of course it is.  Hey, there's Brooke.  Hey, look, it's Brooke on Fox 5.  I was thinking about Brooke Hogan all day yesterday.  Were you?  I think she could.  With your dick in your hand?  I don't know, to be honest.  Because she looked pretty.  Jury's still out on you with you?  No, she looked pretty good yesterday.  She does look pretty good.  The first time she was in, she looked bigger.  I think she lost weight for this, uh, for the promotion of her new CD. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  She looks a little softer now.  Yeah.  Not as, uh, uh, as like, I'm not saying she's out of shape in any sense of the word, but,  uh, she doesn't look as muscular and manly.  She wasn't, yeah, not as meaty.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  But I was thinking about her, like, because a few listeners were bummed that we didn't  just go right after her.  And I don't know.  I think she could be a kind of a friend of the show.  And she seems cool.  She was pretty good yesterday.  No?  Yeah.  And I suggested she arm wrestles with Bobby.  She did it. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, I know.  That's an insult to a girl.  Hey, could you arm wrestle my friend?  That's an insult.  And she said, all right, I'll do it.  You're a big girl.  Video's up on my YouTube channel.  Hopey Radio.  But she was cool.  You liked her?  Yeah, definitely.  I don't like her music.  I'm not going to.  No, no.  That's not my cup of tea, as they say.  No.  No, not at all.  I feel bad for her and Hulk, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you can tell they're real close.  I don't know where the brother stands.  I wonder how much is real.  Really?  That's what I was thinking, too. 
[01:28:00]  I was thinking, you know, the Hulkster's an actor.  Yeah, he is.  He's acted his whole life in wrestling and then, you know, Thunder Lips.  I think it's as real as it gets.  So when he's crying like that, I'm wondering if that was real.  What the fuck was that?  Wow.  Is that her ass?  Whose ass is that?  Apparently it's Linda Hogan.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's the mom?  No way.  No wonder the fucking kid is all over that ass.  Are you kidding me?  Where's that? 
[01:28:30]  It's on a bunch of different sides.  She's got a really nice ass.  No way.  Apparently from that angle, anyway.  There's no fucking way that's Linda Hogan's ass.  You think Hulk would have torn that up over the years?  Get the fuck out of here.  You think it would have looked like King Kong Bundy?  Really?  Where do the peeps go for that?  Well, they could just put Linda Hogan's ass into Google Images.  It'll pop up a lot?  Yeah, first thing.  First, third, sixth.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of...  Yeah, check it out for yourself.  All over the place.  That ass looks way too young to be Linda Hogan's ass. 
[01:29:00]  Holy shit.  Maybe it's just a really good shot.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  What?  Those are some big boobies.  Yeah.  Are you a fan of the big boobies?  No.  Really not.  I was when I was younger.  You've got to grow out of that shit.  I like natural boobies.  Not a fan of that?  Not that big.  No, that's just silly.  What is...  Are there guys that are truly into giant fake tits? 
[01:29:30]  More so than are into just natural boobs no matter what the size?  Yeah.  Believe me, I don't want a nipple on a fucking flat chest.  But...  Somewhere in between.  But yeah, yeah.  A nice B or C is dandy.  You get a firm, youthful D is good.  But that's just gargantuan.  There's no reason for it. 
[01:30:00]  You can't do anything.  They don't feel natural.  They don't look...  They're totally meant for just having clothes on.  Can we do a bit?  Oh, fuck.  Let's start a list.  Let's Photoshop.  Yeah.  Let's start a list today.  This is a little audience participation.  A list of all the things a big boobie girl can't do.  We could start simple.  Running.  That isn't Jimmy licking jizz off his hand. 
[01:30:30]  That's got to be like...  That's a setup.  Come on.  But he said he...  There's a picture of Jimmy licking his palm.  And what is he saying?  This photo has nothing to do with the last say now message I left.  Honest.  No, look.  I see a glistening on his finger.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Did he lose his mind in the last three days?  No, there had to be some, you know, extenuating circumstance.  Where he's just all fucked up and some girl tells him to do it. 
[01:31:00]  Look at his eyes.  Looks like a madman.  He is in a sex frenzy.  Like sharks get into bloodlust and feeding frenzies.  Look at his eyes.  There's no reasoning with that right there.  No, no.  He's licking his own jizz off his hand.  He's probably got his other hand on his dick.  And there's some girl somewhere just ordering him around.  He's got the eyes of a madman.  Absolutely. 
[01:31:30]  Big booby girls can't play golf, too, Ant.  We'll add that to the list.  Yeah, yeah.  Golf.  Running and golf so far.  Archery.  We want some more creative, you know, creative answers to the question.  Best 911 call ever.  Can we squeeze this in?  Because we've got to take a break.  Slip and slide.  Slip and slide.  There you go.  It'll be a little hard for Big Titty Girl to slip and slide.  They can't break dance.  Break dance.  You can't do the worm too good.  The worm.  Ow.  Tennis, of course.  We know that.  That lovely tit monster, we don't even want to acknowledge that she ever lived because she got a reduction. 
[01:32:00]  Do we have new pictures of her yet?  I don't know.  Who cares?  How depressing is that?  Yeah.  That girl had a smoking body.  Great.  Just quit tennis.  What, you were going to win Wimbledon?  Shut up.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Save the tit monster dot com.  Has to go away now.  Just natural.  Mm-hmm.  Big.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That bounce around.  Jesus Christ.  I can't even. 
[01:32:30]  This goes against what we were just saying about the big boobs.  But this is, see, again, this is what I was saying.  She's got the youth on her side and they're natural.  The really nice legs, too.  Yeah.  Not too muscular for a female athlete.  The whole package is really good.  But those things are just anchored down.  Nice connection, Dan.  Right?  Goddamn stupid internet.  Yeah, we're having trouble with that.  Enter two boobs.  All right.  The greatest 911 call ever.  Let's squeeze this in because Seth Rogen's going to be in here in minutes for just like  10 or 15 minutes. 
[01:33:00]  I'm still staring at my sandwich, too.  You want to wait?  Yeah.  We could wait for that.  All right.  We're going to have to wait.  Because, honestly, he's going to be in here any moment.  We've got to take a break, get some food in our bellies.  Yeah.  Best 911 call ever on the way after the Seth Rogen interview, okay?  All right.  Oh, he's going to be 15 minutes late.  So we could do it maybe right out of break.  All right.  Right out of break, we'll squeeze this in before Seth Rogen.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Can we just listen to this song?  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:33:30]  Hello.  Is this on?  Yeah.  What the hell?  All of a sudden, it's low again.  Oh, maybe it's me.  Hold on.  That's a little better.  It happens.  It happens during commercials.  All I was doing was eating.  You've got to glom down everything in one break.  I'm waiting for my food.  You've got to shove a sandwich down your throat.  I'm going to pass out soon if I don't have food.  Food, all right.  Food.  We're waiting for Seth Rogen. 
[01:34:00]  How many more minutes there, Steve?  What?  Just use hand signals, please.  Ten minutes.  What, are we waiting for the king to release him and then we get him?  Then the wolves get him.  Huh?  He just was released and he's doing one other show and then he's coming here.  Okay, good.  Seth Rogen from Funny People in studio within moments.  A few more minutes.  Actually, we get to squeeze in the best 911 call ever, according to Danny, and he won't  tell anyone what this one's about. 
[01:34:30]  He's like, just trust me on this.  Yeah, I mean, there's not one particular thing that's going to, you know, blow everybody  away.  Ah, the back pedal.  No, it's not.  It's just the entire call was good and it made me laugh multiple times.  Okay.  Damn it!  Problem?  Chris C. from Virginia seeing Tool tonight.  Fuck!  Tool.  Where's Tool playing?  I think Liberty State Park is, right?  Part of that thing?  Yeah.  There's like a million bands.  All Points West.  A million bands.  All Points West. 
[01:35:00]  Thank you.  Wow, that's got to be a long show.  Tools tonight?  No, that's not until Saturday, yeah.  Oh, see, I get confused because people listen to us all over the country.  So, Tools in Virginia tonight.  Oh!  And then tomorrow night up here in New York.  That is odd.  All right, no damn it then.  I wouldn't be able to go anyway.  Virginia's far.  Yeah, you got Saturday at Liberty State Park.  I think I'm going, actually.  Really?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Jim Jeffries invited us.  All of us.  Wow.  And Jeffries is coming in tomorrow?  Or next week?  What is he doing? 
[01:35:30]  I think that's next week.  Okay, yeah.  Jim Jeffries invited us because he's doing a set at All Points West.  Cool.  You gave up some really good tool tickets a couple years ago.  Shut up.  I brought you to the other one.  Didn't I take you?  To Tool?  When we were on the balcony?  No, no.  You gave up, like, second row seats at, like, an opera house for Tool.  Oh!  It was really good.  Who did I take to Tool?  Huh?  Were you too drunk to remember?  Did I take you to Tool?  I did not.  I do not remember.  We're up on the balcony on the right side?  I was never on a balcony.  Who the fuck did I bring?  What was that?  I don't know.  It wasn't me. 
[01:36:00]  I know Poe was there, I think, with a date or something, and he didn't even understand  what Tool was all about.  I'm like, what a waste.  They're not building.  Where is this band?  I think it was a record company.  He gave us, like, a nice little section.  Where's Tim Allen?  I didn't bring you.  No, I do not recall that whatsoever if it did.  Sam, I know I didn't bring you.  You don't like Tool.  No.  You pop music idiot.  I'm not an idiot.  I'm not an idiot.  I don't sound like that either.  Yeah, you kind of do. 
[01:36:30]  What's your favorite pop song right now, Sam?  Roberts?  Primetime.  Right now.  Birthday Sex.  That is a good song by Jeremiah.  What is it?  Birthday Sex?  What is that?  Oh, this awfulness.  No, it just came up in the back office one day.  Yeah.  Do you really like this?  Oh, there's the one you guys brought to the show about a week ago.  No, that was a different one.  Oh.  That was Chuggo.  Chuggo.  Oh, Chuggo, of course.  Sorry. 
[01:37:00]  This song is about birthday sex.  Do you get to put in the shitter for your birthday?  Is that what they're singing about?  Bye.  It's auto-tune again.  I can't fucking tell you how much I hate this music.  I fucking hate it.  Those commercials that come up, it's like, text 9583 to fucking, and then they give a number,  for $9.95.  You get all the ringtones and songs you need, and it's always this dribbly shit, fucking 
[01:37:30]  crap R&B auto-tuned garbage.  I kind of like the, I, I, I, I.  I hate it.  Have you heard Jay-Z's Death of Auto-Tune yet?  No, I hear it's really good, though.  It's really good.  This fucking, this genre is so bad.  Jay-Z pronounced it dead, so don't worry.  The king said it's over.  Thank God.  You gotta be crazy to do an auto-tune song after what Jay-Z did. 
[01:38:00]  It's not even the auto-tune part, like, only the auto-tune thing.  It's this fucking whole mellow-ish kind of grooving bullshit.  Did you ever go out with a girl that liked this type of music?  No!  Same here.  Now that I think about it.  Wow.  I fucking.  How would you get along with the girl?  She'd be calling up Ray Liotta, and he threw me out of the car!  Yeah, I didn't, I've been lucky in that way. 
[01:38:30]  This sucks.  Sam, what, I assume your girl likes all the rock stuff?  She's the cool one in the relationship.  She likes some, she likes, like, uh, alternative rock sometimes.  I, I, I, I, I.  She likes hip-hop stuff, too, and R&B stuff, too.  Are we gonna get the best 911 call ever on the radio before Seth Rogen or not?  No, we gotta play some more songs.  I do like, I do like, one, two, three.  Yeah.  That dumb song.  What is that song called?  I can't take this. 
[01:39:00]  Um, I Know You Want Me.  You know that one, eh?  Uh, no.  Pitbull.  Nope.  How could you not know that song?  You know this song.  Nope.  Travis, can you play one, two, three?  Enough with birthdays.  Shh.  Mr. 305, checking in for the remix.  Time's over.  75th Street, Brazil.  Well, this year's gonna be called Cayocho.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Que ola gata, que ola omega.  And this is how we gonna do it.  One, two, three, four.  Dos, tres. 
[01:39:30]  You don't like this, Ant?  I just hear, like, this is ambient.  Animal nitrate and ass sex.  What?  Like, this is just gay sex happening to this.  The best is Anthony gets really, really annoyed.  I hate this.  It's just catchy, dumb shit.  Well, this isn't even...  It's catchy, dumb shit.  By the way, this isn't even the type of music that I was just criticizing.  No.  This is something totally different.  I don't like this part.  It doesn't annoy me as much as the other shit. 
[01:40:00]  The other shit is that dumb bitch fucking music that just...  It's her talking about some fucking guy and how, you know, he treats her good.  So, you know, that's all bullshit anyway.  Meanwhile, I was, you know, punching her in the face as they're driving down the road.  Two, three, four.  This is awful.  All right.  Let's get the best 911 call ever on the air for everybody, please.  I hate this music.  Shut up, Randy, you auto-tuning son of a bitch. 
[01:40:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  Randy.  And Erica from Jersey.  I agree with Ant.  This music sucks a dick.  Thank you.  Whatever.  Play the fucking 911 call, you OCD fucks.  That's Greg the Trucker.  Do we have time?  Is Seth Rogen coming in at any moment?  He's bumped again.  He's bumped to 850 now.  For real?  Yeah.  Who shows he on?  No.  He's still with the other guy.  With the king?  He got misinformation.  The king hasn't released him yet?  Well, isn't that weird that we have to stick to 10 minutes? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  We've been told 10 minutes and don't go any fucking longer.  And then we got in trouble yesterday for fucking Brooke Hogan being on for longer than 10 minutes,  two seconds.  Look.  And, you know, whatever.  Look, you know, you better get those paddles up.  Yeah, yeah.  The company takes care of one guy and everyone else is shit, you know.  Yeah, here you go.  That's a wonderful way to...  Paddles up.  Paddles up.  Paddles up.  To...  Paddle.  To...  I'll tweet the rest.  Paddles up.  All right.  This is what I do now.  Paddles up.  But there is a grave injustice. 
[01:41:30]  I'm paddling myself now.  But then I give you a green.  Hold it.  Brilliant way to run it.  Here we go.  I'll hold it way back here so we both get red paddled.  Brilliant way to run a company.  Anyway, greatest 911 call ever.  Yeah.  As per Danny.  So when is the King releasing Seth for everybody else?  Probably pretty soon, but then he's got to do another show before he comes here.  Right.  You know what?  I might have to say something.  I might have to say...  It's not... 
[01:42:00]  Let me write it down for him.  It has nothing to do with him.  Let me just write this.  I don't think it has anything to do with him.  You want to play Write It Down Sam?  Yeah, play Write It Down Sam.  I love this game.  This is Write It Down Opie, though.  No, this is Opie playing Write It Down Sam.  Yeah.  Write it down, Opie.  All right.  Just write it down.  Okay, here it is.  Opie was writing.  Of course, we've got to write it down segment music playing.  This is what I say today. 
[01:42:30]  Write it down, Sam.  No.  What?  No.  What?  That could cause some problems in the future.  Who's writing next?  I will.  Let's write it down, Sam.  Write it down, Sam.  Oh, Sam is actually writing it down.  Oh, wow.  No.  No.  You can't read Write It Down Sam.  Oh.  That's why it's Write It Down Sam.  Nicky wants attention.  That's the first time little Nicky walked by.  Little Nicky.  And we didn't acknowledge him, so he waved a lot.  I missed him.  Hoping we would notice him.  And you want to write something down? 
[01:43:00]  We're in the middle of Write It Down Sam.  Write It Down Sam.  Yeah.  Let me write.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Write It Down Sam.  You put the cap on.  It's too tight.  Sorry, I'm very strong.  Smell that sharpie.  Whoa.  Should write Mildred on a cardboard box with it.  Open Anthony.  We need to do a few hours.  Dance Party Weekend.  Huh?  All right.  Write It Down Sam.  Although Anthony's doing the writing.  We're going to change the bit.  We can't have it Write It Down Sam. 
[01:43:30]  It's got to be Write It Down.  Really?  Yeah.  Here it is.  I got one more thing to write.  All right.  Write It Down Sam.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  That's who's to blame.  Really?  Yeah.  That's who's to blame.  All right.  Well, this is what I write, then.  All right.  Here's the sharpie, Sam.  Okay.  You got to write something down, Sam.  All right.  Opie's writing.  Write It Down Opie.  Wow. 
[01:44:00]  He's writing fast.  He's got a lot there.  It's like a paragraph.  Jesus.  Weren't these one-word answers originally?  It's too bad I can be funny when it comes to writing.  Is that it?  You're writing.  I guarantee I'll get a laugh.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Let's see.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  No.  We can't.  No.  No.  We need a shredder for the end of Sam segment. 
[01:44:30]  We need a shredder.  We have to shred everything after the segment.  The official shredder.  Yeah.  Of Write It Down Sam.  Maybe a sponsor will jump on board.  People want us to do our you, you, you, me, me, me bit.  I love that bit, too, Carolina, man.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, you, you, you, you, you.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, you, you, you, you, you.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, you, you, you, you, you. 
[01:45:00]  When is the King releasing him, really?  When he's all finished.  Yeah.  He's got to go somewhere else, though, anyway.  Really?  All right.  I'd rather have Louis C.K. in.  Where is Louis?  He'll be here soon.  All right, best 911 call ever.  Let's get this out of the way in.  Yeah, let's get to it now that we have plenty of time.  I'm sorry, it's ****** 20 ****** 0 Winford?  Yeah.  Okay, and what's going on there?  That shit happened yesterday, and you motherfuckers trying to put my ass in jail.  It's not understanding what's going on. 
[01:45:30]  Okay, do you need medical attention?  Yeah.  What is wrong?  I don't know.  I ain't no goddamn doctor.  Okay, sir, I'm trying to help you.  Well, help me send me somebody out here.  What the hell?  What's the hole up?  Sir, are you feeling pain?  What is the problem?  I'm crazy as hell.  S.O., do you need us?  I don't know what I need.  Sheriff's office, are you on the line?  Yes, we are.  Do you need us to go with you?  He said somebody can't have his heart.  I ain't had my goddamn medicine this morning. 
[01:46:00]  I ain't got no medicine.  I went to the fucking hospital, and the doctor got mad because I told him that white boys used to fuck my mama a long time ago.  Sir, are you in pain somewhere, or what is it?  Yes, I got headaches, and my leg, and everything.  I've been in a fucking fight.  So you want the paramedics to come and check you, correct?  That's what I thought you were getting.  What the hell's going on?  Sir, you need to calm down and talk to me.  I am trying to help you, and I'm trying to send the paramedics, but I need to understand what the problem is. 
[01:46:30]  I don't know what the problem is.  Okay, but you're feeling head pain.  Is that correct?  I've been, yes, I've been injured.  I've been hit on the head and everything else.  How else do a mother must be a shock?  All right, when did that happen?  Yesterday.  Damn.  My head is hurting.  You're going to sense in my head, or you're going to fuck around on the phone?  Sir, I have no problem sending you help, okay?  The paramedics will come, and they'll check you.  Oh, she's getting frustrated. 
[01:47:00]  He's just going to fuck around on the phone.  He's got a point, though.  That's her job, though.  What do we know so far?  I'm very confused.  This guy got into a fight.  He's calling 911, and he just wants, he doesn't understand why he just can't call 911 and then get response.  Yeah, he wants them to just show up.  But, you know, it could be a police.  It could be paramedic.  It could be fire.  It could be, like, you need to tell the person what the problem is so that they can send the proper equipment over.  It could be a kitten in the tree. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  It continues.  The caller gets very frustrated.  Because she's just fucking around on the phone.  Yeah.  How old are you?  I'm 62 years old.  I retired from Democrats.  Okay, and are you in Millennium Point Apartments?  Yes.  What apartment number are you in?  What's going on down there, ma'am?  Sir, I am trying to help you.  What apartment number are you in?  Shit, my head is hurting.  Can you tell me what apartment number you're in? 
[01:48:00]  What?  What apartment number are you in?  I ain't no goddamn apartment.  Are you in Millennium Point Apartments?  Motherfucker, what's wrong with your ass?  How much schooling have you had?  Sir, are you in Millennium Point Apartments?  I told you that.  Okay, what apartment number are you in?  What apartment number are you in?  I ain't got no goddamn apartment.  It's a town.  House.  Okay, and what kind of medical history do you have, sir?  I don't know.  Let them check it out.  I ain't no fucking doctor. 
[01:48:30]  I ain't no nurse either.  I don't know.  Are you anything else you want to know?  That's how it's been since you've been called.  What's your name?  I'm ******.  And what's the phone number that you're calling from?  I don't know what it is.  I gave you the goddamn address.  That's enough.  Are you, is your phone number 407-88***?  ******.  Well, you know the fucking number. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, why'd you ask me?  Because I need to confirm it with you, sir.  All right, you go.  Oh, this motherfucker.  He doesn't have a head injury.  No, this guy's, this guy's fine.  He's just an asshole.  You know about him, but I ask me.  Motherfucking asshole.  He's just an asshole.  They should leave there to just die with his head injury.  And we got one more piece here.  Do you not have an apartment number?  I ain't got no goddamn, I don't live in no goddamn apartment.  I live in a townhouse, motherfucker. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  S.O.?  Yeah, we still have you.  Do you, sir, do you have a townhouse number?  42 ******, motherfucker.  Okay.  S.O., we definitely need you to go with us.  We're on our way.  Okay.  I'll let them know.  Sir, stay on the phone with the sheriff's office, okay?  Do you need to talk to him, S.O.?  I'm going to try.  Okay.  Thank you.  Sir?  Hello?  Yes.  The guy that hit you, is he still there?  Yeah, yeah.  He lives over here right across the Runa Dope House right next door, too. 
[01:50:00]  White, black, or Hispanic?  I don't know what color he is.  You call him what you want to call him.  Why does he look to you?  I don't know.  He looks like one of Jesus' children.  He looks like what?  One of Jesus' children.  Okay.  What's his skin color?  I don't know.  I don't see no color.  Do you know what color clothes he's wearing?  I don't know the motherfucker in the house.  Okay, so we have somebody come see you, okay?  All right.  Goodbye.  That guy is so in trouble. 
[01:50:30]  I like him.  All of his parts were just so valid, though.  He's just like, well, what's your medical?  He's like, I don't know.  I ain't a fucking doctor.  I ain't a doctor.  That's why I need some motherfucking come over here.  Why do you need my phone number if you can come to my house?  You got my number.  You have it.  You got my address.  You're asking me for it.  Come on.  What's he wearing?  I don't know.  He's probably wearing something else now.  I don't know.  He's in the house.  Andy in New Hampshire.  Andy.  Yo, we get brutalized all the time on these things.  We have these cards we have to follow, and you have to follow them, and you feel like 
[01:51:00]  a retard asking these guys these questions.  You've got the answer.  That's how the guy got him.  You got my number.  Why did you ask me?  Why did you ask me?  He was pretty good.  He was a little belligerent.  Did you catch the one where he said, I didn't live in an apartment?  I live in a town?  He goes, a townhouse.  Yeah.  No, he said town.  Oh, town first.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That's definitely a really good 911 call, man.  Yeah, it's not like a 24-second call where this is one main idea.  It's like just the whole body of work. 
[01:51:30]  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  He's calling a motherfucker.  I had no fucking doctor.  What a disrespectful douchebag.  Or nurse.  I kind of liked him.  Did you?  You didn't like him?  You have him over your place.  I kind of liked the guy.  You know, in the raw audio, I don't know how old the call is, but in the raw audio, it  gives his phone number if you want to try to get a hold of him.  I'll get a hold of him.  Yeah, like that number is actually working or is paid for.  The number was disconnected the second he made that call.  I need a bambalance. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, give me a bambalance.  I need a damn bambalance.  I like how they're like, yeah, we definitely need you to go along, the sheriff's department.  Like, yeah, I want to go along with this ride.  All right, we're in a speed round because we got Louis C.K. here.  We got Seth Rogen coming in in a few minutes, hopefully.  But first, little Nicky.  He walks down the hall every day.  We acknowledge him, right?  He's never been on our show.  No.  A little background on little Nicky.  The guy is a great production guy, and he decided to make a little piece for us.  Ooh.  Is that hooker in the trunk distracting you? 
[01:52:30]  Shut the fuck up!  Just now realizing that bottle of Jack and eight bottle of Coke you did one night led to  this 18-year crying commitment that just shit itself.  Aw, don't cry.  Let's put a pillow on your face.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  Whatever your reason is for missing the Opie and Anthony show this morning, you can catch  it again.  Hear it again at 3 and 8 p.m. Eastern on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  That's little Nicky. 
[01:53:00]  Okay, little Nicky.  That's little Nicky.  Out of his fucking mind.  That's little Nicky.  Holy shit.  His real name is Jerry.  And he's a...  Jerry!  They say he's the best production guy here at Sirius XM.  That is pretty goddamn funny.  And we need him to do some production for us.  That was pretty damn good, right?  Anytime you're suffocating a small child in production.  I thought Steve was angry.  God bless little Nicky.  Jerry, actually.  And then we also had the blown home run call one of the listeners turned us on to.  We missed this one as we were prepping for the show today. 
[01:53:30]  Dodgers, Cardinals.  And I guess it's an epic fail on many levels.  The announcer, I think the players themselves, and the fans all got...  All got it wrong?  All got it wrong.  This has been a great pitching matchup.  Kershaw, no runs on only four hits.  The pitch.  Ryan swings, and it's a high fly ball.  Deep left field.  Ramirez back to the track.  At the wall.  And it's a goner. 
[01:54:00]  A home run for Ryan.  Ryan is standing near second base.  Oh, man, he caught the ball.  He caught it.  We thought it was gone, and he caught the ball, and Ryan was standing out there.  He leaped and just made the catch above the wall.  We get to look at it right now, and he caught it at the top of the wall by the number 85 for Mr. Bush.  Oh, he made a heck of a play.  Looked like that ball took a bounce, but something else flew out there, and that was an out. 
[01:54:30]  And Ryan is denied perhaps a home run and high fives from Manny Ramirez.  So instead of a cardinal lead, we're going to the eighth, and the Dodgers are still leading 1-0.  Wow, man.  Yeah, because apparently the park got it wrong, too.  Yeah, you heard the fireworks.  Because they were setting off the fireworks and the home run sound effects and everything.  Oops.  Oopsie.  We got better ones.  That's a goner.  That one's pretty good.  I don't think it was a goner. 
[01:55:00]  Yankees won last night, right?  Three and a half games ahead of...  I don't care.  I don't care.  Yeah, because the Mets are...  Mets are...  But, yeah, three and a half ahead of Boston.  Nice.  It's Boston.  Lawston.  Bofferson.  We're going to have to make...  We want to make sure that the good people are Bofferson.  We're going to have to make a judgment call soon.  Yeah?  I think so.  Really?  Yes.  Well, I think we should bring Louis in. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  I think we bring Louis.  Louis shouldn't have to fucking wait.  The King hasn't released Seth Rogen yet, so we might have to make our own judgment call.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Steve the Whistler?  Yeah.  I was hooked on it.  Louis C.K. will join the program next.  He's going to be at Caroline's this weekend, right?  That's fucking huge.  You better get your tickets immediately.  212-757-4100, I believe, for Caroline's. 
[01:56:00]  Louis C.K.  Those tickets will go fast.  I'm doing Doyle Hargrave's song.  Oh, shit.  That's Steve the Whistle.  Quick break.  Quick break.  We got to eat.  Louis walking down the hall.  You're whistling, son of a bitch.  And we'll continue with that whistling song after the break.  Stay there.  Opiate Anthony.  Yeah, shit. 
[01:56:30]  I'm always going off my nose.  You know what?  We got a very busy show today, but this is the moment right here, I'm telling you.  Louis C.K. in studio.  It's been, I don't even know how long.  We were at the other building.  That's right.  The last time I was at the other building.  So it's got to be at least four months.  Louis C.K. is playing Caroline's.  You're starting tonight, Lou?  Yeah, it's all sold out until Sunday, I think.  Oh, it is?  Oh, shit.  Sunday night, there's still tickets.  Then go home.  Yeah, right?  No, I'm not here to plug.  I don't care about putting it.  That proves that Louis likes our show. 
[01:57:00]  Because he doesn't even have to be here.  I got nothing to plug.  Only Sunday shows.  Yeah, but that's going to sell out, too.  I mean, it doesn't even matter.  Doesn't matter?  It doesn't matter at all.  They should just keep adding shows.  Well, then I got to do them.  You don't want to?  I mean, it'd be one thing if it was just like, just come and pay money.  The tickets are what they're after.  It's not the show.  You know what?  I'm thinking you could squeeze a third show in, though.  Sure.  I've seen that before at Caroline's.  It's not fun for you guys, but.  No, I won't do it.  You've got a midnight show where everyone's been drinking for four straight hours.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:57:30]  And you're trying to do your thing.  I don't think I have an upside to tickets this time.  I think I'm getting a flat amount of money from Caroline's.  So I actually don't even say that I'm playing there.  Okay, all right.  I got you.  I got you.  You've been in the country?  Yeah, upstate.  And he was telling Ant and I that he listens all the time because he's bored in the country.  And he heard you yelling and screaming the other day.  Yeah, I'm always screaming about taxes and stuff like that.  But still, the thing that's been haunting me, just every day I think about it now, and  it makes me really sick, when you had Bobo in here. 
[01:58:00]  Is that his name?  Oh, God.  And you had, what's his name?  Smell his cock?  Yeah, yeah.  We're on World Cup.  He had to smell his dick.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  E-Rock had to smell his dick.  But the thing that upset me was you saying, telling him to ruffle up his pubic hair to  release the smell.  It's like a scratch and sniff.  You got to kind of...  Like if you tussle, you're telling him to tussle the pubes.  Tussle your pubes so the smell is released.  And every time I think about that, and I gag, like a few times a day, for some reason, 
[01:58:30]  it's like a song stuck in my head.  That is disgusting.  There's like a moment, I was dropping off my kids, and I'm walking away from the little  camp, this little idyllic camp they have, where there's literally a donkey in the middle  of the camp.  And I remember, it just pops in my head, tussle your pubic hair so the cock smell gets worse.  And I imagine that really clearly, and I got fucking, I just got so sick.  That is really disgusting.  Just the idea that, so first of all, you're making a guy smell some retarded guy's cock. 
[01:59:00]  But the idea that you had this notion of, wait a minute, wait a minute, this isn't...  We can make this worse.  It's not bad enough.  Like you're like, it's like a technician for, no, no, no, to get the full potency of the  cock smell.  Of the dirty dick smell.  You got to just, you got to ruffle the hair.  Did you hear the follow-up show?  The following Friday, he came back?  I heard something, I'm trying to remember what happened.  After the show, these guys discovered, because they're just bored and sick fucks, that Bobo 
[01:59:30]  gets boners really easily.  Oh, right.  You had his dick out, and he was standing here getting hard.  Yeah.  Hard and soft, though, depending on what we were talking about.  And you guys were going from, yes, I was listening to that.  You're going from baseball to...  To that girl that he's in love with.  You know what's weird is that there was a guy in my hometown, he might still be there,  and we called him Florida Steve.  Why'd you call him that?  That was his...  He was a guy, a little kind of oldish man that walked around town, just walked around, 
[02:00:00]  and kids would go up to him, and he'd go, how you doing?  He'd just walk up to you, hey, hot day, huh?  It was hot.  It was a routine.  It was like Abbott and Costello.  Was he retarded in any way?  Yeah, I think he was sort of retarded.  Hot day, right?  Hot day.  And you go, yeah, it's hot.  And he goes, hotter in Florida, isn't it?  Yeah, it's pretty hot in Florida.  He would guide you to what he would...  What's it like down in Florida?  Ah, it's nice.  Girls down there?  What are the girls like down there?  Oh, shit.  Well, they got nice girls in Florida. 
[02:00:30]  They got big tits?  Yeah, they got big tits, Steve.  And then he'd put his hand in his pocket, and he'd just start jacking off right in front  of you.  Big bottoms, big...  And it was just a routine.  It was like Abbott and Costello.  And then at one point, you'd go, hey, what are you doing down there in your pants?  And you'd go, get out of here.  I'll cut you to ribbons.  You won't say that when the bullets fly, and he'd start...  He'd start threatening you, and then you'd walk away.  I think every town's got one.  I'm trying to think if I had one.  This guy called Crazy John.  And he used to be behind John's Bargain Store. 
[02:01:00]  I don't know if his name was John, but we just called him Crazy John.  Because he was behind John's Bargain Store.  And he had a shopping cart with a big...  It's like naming a stray dog.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just that way they named him after the bargain store.  Jesus.  I know.  And he would collect plastic bags.  And he'd come up to you and just go, plastic bag?  Plastic bag?  Plastic bag?  And you're like, I haven't seen any plastic bags, John.  Okay.  And then he'd go off to the dumpster. 
[02:01:30]  And he had one of those giant...  You know those big sunflower, plastic sunflowers people put in their lawns that spin around in the wind?  Sure.  He had that on his shopping cart.  And he'd push it around looking for plastic bags.  Plastic bags.  Crazy, crazy John.  Remember Eddie at WNEW?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Another.  Eddie worked at NEW when we were over there.  And his whole job was to empty the garbage from offices.  Yeah.  And he loved tits.  Yeah.  Where he would uncomfortably stare at tits. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, he had no switch where it's like, you know, you shouldn't do that.  You know, you take a cleanse.  Because he'd go, I like that girl.  She was pretty cute.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, he's just looking at her tits.  And the fucking girls all creeped out.  I brought him to the...  Somehow, the guys talked me to take him out for lunch.  So I took him to the Brooklyn Diner and the waitress had a nice tits.  Oh, no.  It was so awkward.  Jesus.  We could barely eat lunch because Eddie just had a stare at tits the entire time.  Horniness plus retardation is a bad combination.  Oh, bad combination. 
[02:02:30]  There's no switch.  They just like...  Yeah.  What do you got, Ant?  Brooke Hogan?  I was wondering if Brooke Hogan, what she sounds like acoustically.  Or is she lip syncing?  No.  What can we do?  Can you pot it up?  Very, very interesting.  The name of the song is Hey Yo.  That time okay.  But I had to let you know.  Just in case it didn't show.  Oh, some say love and friends they don't mix.  But I love the way that I feel. 
[02:03:00]  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  I know you and me.  It seems weird, but...  Who is that faggot?  Who is that jerry-curled faggot who's playing with her?  He's got shiny jeans.  What a fruit.  I'll be back this way in a minute.  Hey, you and me.  Are you with it?  No, I'm not.  Oh, God.  What is with him?  And you know that I'd ride for you.  No, you're not.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  I know you won't suffer. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, I will if I hear this anymore.  Yeah, this is really bad.  I promise to show you.  I love the Kenwin.  He could go over...  Ew!  Boo!  Oh.  How does he go over anyone's house and sit on their couch?  Yeah, exactly.  How's he a person?  Fucking wet all over there.  Time okay.  Time okay.  All right.  But I had to let you know.  I'm sorry.  I even brought it up.  That's one of the worst things I've ever heard in my life.  That's really, really bad. 
[02:04:00]  That's horrible.  Oh, boy.  I'd rather listen to my mom beg for mercy while somebody kills her.  That was horrible.  People are also reminding us that Eddie also was in charge of the mail and getting it all wrong.  Oh, no.  He used to get it all wrong.  Yeah.  Hey, this guy's wearing, like, a glovey thing.  What, a Michael Jackson glove?  No, it's worse.  Look on his left hand on his guitar hand.  Oh, yeah.  It's like a hand brace, but it's sparkly.  It's like when you get a sprained wrist. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But it's sparkly.  No, that wasn't good.  You can't stop the song for your shit note that didn't work.  It's your crappy...  He's just making it up now.  Yeah.  All right.  Excellent.  Look at his hand.  Look at his hand.  Thank you so much.  He's got sparkly wrist brace on.  Oh.  Oh, you ugly whore.  Fuck you.  You fucking retard.  He's very talented.  He's really, really talented.  No, he's not.  Neither are you, you fucking stupid cunts. 
[02:05:00]  God damn it.  Fucking boring.  Fucking stupid.  Ugly common.  Fucking two-bit stripper.  She comes over and says, do you want a private dance?  And I go, no.  I go, no.  I'm waiting for somebody interesting looking.  Fucking dime a dozen blonde.  Fucking father famous for being a buffoon idiot. 
[02:05:30]  Fucking.  She even knows the guy isn't talented because she had to go, yeah, he's really talented.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, really?  That's what I just heard was good?  Oh, thanks.  Yeah.  You know the shit you just heard?  That's like everybody that has a boyfriend where they're like, oh, yeah, no, he's really great.  Really?  Yeah, he's great.  It's funny because I just heard him.  Oh, thanks for telling me because it sounded like shit.  It sounded like it wasn't good.  Oh, you fucking.  She's really fucking great, funny.  I love it. 
[02:06:00]  No, I listened to her on this show.  She was on and I was like, shut.  She fucking ruined my morning.  I hate her.  Yeah.  Because my morning, I dropped my kids off in this fucking crazy camp and then I listen  to you guys on my way back.  I got nothing else to do.  I look at the same shit strip of fucking Country Road every morning and I listen to you guys.  And it was her.  And there's you trying to be funny and fucking.  We had her arm wrestle though.  I didn't get that far.  It's the first time I've switched. 
[02:06:30]  I switched the fucking station.  That's not good here.  You gotta.  Well, keep that in mind.  She makes people like me turn your show off.  That's good to know for next time.  We go, hey, Brooke, would you arm wrestle Robert Kelly?  And she goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that kind of insulting to ask a girl to arm wrestle a guy?  Why?  Why do you mean?  Because she's a bruiser.  Oh, because she's got big fat arms.  I see what you mean.  Why else would I say would you arm wrestle Robert Kelly?  Because he's a weak slob. 
[02:07:00]  He's got little Tyrannosaurus Rex arms.  What is she doing there in that picture?  She's giving a piggyback ride.  Looks like she's taking a shit.  I don't know.  I hate that people like her exist.  I mean, it's the worst.  It's just so many generations down from mattering.  You know what I mean?  Like Hulk Hogan even shouldn't matter.  He's a joke.  He's a fringe celebrity.  And then Hulk.  But now he's a fucking mainstream write down.  Like he's going to get like the, he's going to be at the Kennedy honors with the president 
[02:07:30]  someday.  Yeah.  Because he, just for being fucking stupid spectacle in front of other people.  And his fucking daughter, his grown up cum, gets to be on TV and play a song with her faggot  boyfriend with sparkly jeans and everybody's got to act like it's good.  It's sparkly wrist brace.  And she comes to this building and you guys have her, everybody has to have her on and  act like, and so then what happened with your dad?  Who gives a shit? 
[02:08:00]  He's making us look bad.  Fuck her.  No, you have to do it.  How do you not do it?  If I had this, look, if I had this show, I would, I'd go, can we get her please?  And I'd be nice to her.  Louie is a dose of reality.  You're giving a, yeah, a little taste.  There's no problem there.  That's why we do like you.  Louie is a dose of reality, man.  Yep.  He's right.  He's right.  Fuck what we think.  You guys, three hours with Bobo is worth a lot more.  It's true.  And don't go to the message boards because they don't like Bobo either. 
[02:08:30]  Look, I'm in a minority.  I love Bobo, but you go to the message boards, they're like enough with Bobo.  They're listening.  But they listen.  They listen.  Yeah, I assume.  Did anybody write and say, she's awesome, keep her on, and have her on again?  One person.  Well, there you go.  One person did.  All that response for Bobo, one response for her.  Yeah.  All of his response was negative and hers was positive.  Bobo makes people react.  Yeah, you want.  That's what you want from a radio show. 
[02:09:00]  Of course.  Good, bad, whatever.  You want people talking and reacting.  Yeah, we didn't get much reaction after the Brooke Hogan interview yesterday.  No.  Louis C.K.  Now we feel really bad about ourselves as broadcasters.  It's America sleeping.  Let's get the horse fuck story on.  Yes.  Oh, this guy fucked a horse?  What happened?  Well, he has a history of doing this.  He got caught.  It's called buggery, you know.  Is it?  Is that what buggery is?  Yeah.  I didn't know that. 
[02:09:30]  Like horse and buggy?  No, because buggery.  Because you're being a buggy sort of for the horse.  It's an English law.  Yeah, you're kind of being a buggy by proxy.  It's like buggery.  I wonder if that is what it is from.  No, because I don't know.  Because it means anal intercourse with a man or a woman.  If you're a guy and you have anal intercourse with a man or a woman, you are engaging in buggery.  But also vaginal intercourse with a horse is buggery.  But anal with a horse is not considered buggery. 
[02:10:00]  It's considered something else.  You know, some sick sodomy fucking thing that will still get you put on the rack in England, I'm sure.  But who had to decide that one?  Yeah, they decided that buggery is sex up the ass on a human or vaginal sex with a horse.  Wait a minute.  Sex up the ass with a human or vaginal sex with a horse?  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  It's the same thing.  Can you believe that shit? 
[02:10:30]  You can fuck a horse in the ass and it's not buggery.  And it's not buggery.  But is it something worse?  I'm sure.  A person's asshole and a horse's vagina.  Same thing.  Yeah.  They considered it the same kind of fucking...  Well, but wait, maybe is there a step up for a horse's asshole?  Maybe it's just another thing.  I think that's what it is.  I think it's even worse.  It's like murder one.  Yeah, yeah.  Although the penalty for buggery up until 1861...  It was getting fucked up the ass by a horse.  Yes, the horse gets to have his little peace with people. 
[02:11:00]  Was death.  By hanging.  Really?  And then after that, it was life in prison.  And now...  Did you have to sit on the horse that you fucked in the ass when you get hung?  Fuck you and the horse you fucked.  Fuck you and the horse you fucked.  And fuck both.  And fuck both of you.  Yeah, anal intercourse by a man with a man or woman.  Or vaginal intercourse by either a man or a woman with an animal.  Now, how does a woman...  What are you reading this off of, by the way?  The definition of buggery.  From what, though?  Ah, from Wikipedia. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, just go Wikipedia.  Anal intercourse.  I love also the stuff that's highlighted to give you other references.  Yes, yes.  I might need that.  No, I got the...  Yeah.  Anal intercourse highlighted, if you're interested.  More to say about that.  Yes, it's a link.  By a man with a man or a woman.  Yeah, you can't fuck that ass.  Or vaginal intercourse by either a man or a woman with an animal.  With an animal.  How does a woman fuck a horse up the asshole?  That's what I want to know.  Well, a vagina.  Vagina. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, vaginal intercourse.  Yeah.  Okay, so then, yeah.  How does a woman...  I guess with her fist?  You can't fist a horse in a vagina?  No, I think that means letting a horse...  Fuck you.  Look at you.  Look at me.  I've been thinking of that, like, since I read it yesterday, going, how does a woman  do...  But it's the horse fucking the woman.  Or it says, by the way, it says animals, so a dog, women can be fucked by dogs.  I've seen it.  Now, what about the woman getting fucked in the ass by an animal?  Because that wasn't covered there.  That's going to be a different thing. 
[02:12:30]  That's got to be worse.  Yeah.  It's got to be worse.  They don't step it down and go, at least it's not buggery.  I think that's called tomfoolery.  Tomfoolery.  Yeah, buggery is like one of those words where it should be tomfoolery.  I think it's a...  I think a woman being fucked in the ass by a horse is shenanigans.  I think it's shenanigans.  Only done by a scallywag.  Exactly.  Wow, they just said shenanigans.  Visiting this website may harm your...  That's all these words that used to be horrible, but now they don't matter anymore.  Now it's just funny.  Yeah, it turns out...  If you really look up the epitomology or whatever it's called... 
[02:13:00]  Shenanigans.  Turns out a horse coming in a woman's mouth is called silliness.  It's just that it's been softened over the years.  Yeah, being engaged in shenanigans years ago was probably a pretty bad thing.  Yeah.  Now it's just...  It's funny to say.  The word itself is just...  Shenanigans.  You can't be serious when you say it.  Well, you want the update on the horse fucker?  Buggery.  I certainly do.  You gotta hear this one.  Barbara Kenley says her horse of 15 years, Sugar, is like a child to her. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, boy.  But a year and a half ago, she discovered this man, Rodell Vereen, inside Sugar Stable.  Oh.  Oh.  Inside the stable.  So to speak.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Stable.  All right.  Jesus.  Inside Sugar Stable.  He pleaded guilty to having sex with the horse.  I mean, I don't know how to explain to you the sick feeling.  Vereen was placed on South Carolina's sex offender list and got three years probation.  But Kenley says that was little comfort to her. 
[02:14:00]  Every night going to bed thinking, is that man out there with my animals?  What is he doing to my horse?  Fucking it.  And I, like I said, I just couldn't sleep thinking about it.  She suspected Vereen was back.  Or can't fucking masturbate and get it over with.  Fucking wants to rub one out and go to sleep.  That's what I do when I think he ain't fucking the horse.  Who cares if someone's fucking your horse?  I just couldn't sleep thinking about it.  She suspected Vereen was back and secretly violating Sugar again.  When I come to feed the next morning that I hadn't sat out here waiting for him and she'd been molested again, it was devastating. 
[02:14:30]  Kenley says she would sometimes spend the night inside the stables with a shotgun to keep an eye on Sugar.  With her ass perched up waiting.  Why not me?  There's a perfectly good fucking woman in the room.  Yeah.  He's fucking my horse?  First of all, you don't name a horse Sugar and not expect it to be fucked.  That's just a sexy name for a horse.  Gotta give it a bad name.  This is one of our favorite pictures.  Horse vagina.  This is horse vagina. 
[02:15:00]  Is it really?  Yeah.  That does look like it.  I get it.  I get it.  If you had to.  But it looks like it's got balls above it, though.  Yeah, that's the asshole above it.  Yeah.  And then there's sort of what looks like the alien that wrapped around that guy's neck, tail.  Wow.  Yeah.  It doesn't look very hairy.  It's really like a...  It looks like a Geiger painting.  They're all pink on the inside.  Yeah, it looks like a galaxy.  But you can see how it would probably feel good on your cock if it wasn't, you know, attached to a horse. 
[02:15:30]  It doesn't look very wet.  Well, you gotta whisper in its ear.  Yeah, you're fucking hot.  Oh, you fucking...  Yeah, you bitch.  ...with a shotgun to keep an eye on sugar.  She says she thought about shooting Vereen, but didn't want to go to prison.  That's when she installed this.  And moving my camera in various spots.  And then I finally got a good picture.  She should have been arrested for filming bestiality.  Wouldn't that be great if they arrested her?  You can't film this shit. 
[02:16:00]  No.  It's like fucking, yeah, I'm gonna catch a child pornographer for...  I'm gonna film him having sex with a child.  No.  That's illegal.  Oh, dumb.  Dumb woman.  Yeah, this woman is just...  She deserves to have a horse as fuck.  Yeah, what does she do?  How does this woman have a horse and a stable and a shotgun and a camera?  All these fucking props.  She's got a bunch of shit going on.  And then I finally got a good picture of him.  Police arrested Vereen on Monday after he was caught on tape earlier this month molesting 
[02:16:30]  the horse.  He didn't resist or fight back or deny.  The horse?  Yeah, the horse loved it.  Yeah.  The horse doesn't...  Have you ever seen another horse fuck a horse?  Yeah.  It's probably one of the most violent things I've ever seen.  We had this horse named Concho Pete.  Concho Pete was one of the few horses at our stable that wasn't a gelding.  And they used to breed it.  What are you talking about?  This is when I lived out in California.  Horses are all horses.  Horses fucking...  I was Mr. Cowboy. 
[02:17:00]  Equestrian guy.  Buggies.  Dreamweaver.  Oh, I had horses.  You had everything out there.  I was the shit.  I have pictures of me with boots, the hat, the whole fucking deal.  I was a hick fucking cowboy.  But I was, you know, 14 years old, so I was a kid.  Wow.  Grew up that way.  Yeah.  You grew up in Massachusetts and you're...  No, I grew up in New York originally.  And then my father moved out to California, so I went to live with him.  And then, you know, he wanted to be a cowboy.  So Danny's going to find some horse fucking videos.  Conjo P would bite the back of the neck of all the mares and just stick this giant, giant 
[02:17:30]  con.  Wow.  I don't care.  I know the guy was of a certain ethnicity, this criminal that was molesting the horses,  but no way it's as big as a horse.  Look at this horse border.  And they just shove it in.  How the fuck does he guide that into anything?  I think the people have to guide it in.  Like, look, they can't just let them fuck.  They're tying this horse up in a certain...  I guess that's so it doesn't completely kill the mare.  But how do they get it done in nature before we got involved? 
[02:18:00]  They wrap the tail like a boxer.  Yeah, they got to wrap the tail up.  That's the female.  Yeah, but why do you have to wrap the tail if the two horses were in the...  Oh my God, look at this.  Look at this fucking...  Oh, man, holy shit.  Man, he's coming already.  Look at all that spurt.  He's fucking coming already.  Horses...  Horses...  Yeah.  Look at his neck.  And he's biting the horse's neck.  And the horse is just standing there like...  Horses have no staying power.  All horses prematurely ejaculate.  There's no pleasure for the female, huh? 
[02:18:30]  Look at that.  The female doesn't know what the fuck's got.  What a rod he's got, though.  The female's like, just do it.  It's bending.  He's trying to find how to get in.  Good technique on the horse's part, huh?  But that's two pumps and he's done.  Boom.  Two pump chump.  He's the two pump kid.  Oh, it's all fucking yellow.  God damn.  He is fucking in there, too.  He's a good two feet inside that vagina.  His cum looks like the wood glue that he's going to be in a couple years.  From glue to glue. 
[02:19:00]  All right, he's done.  Get him off the fucking thing.  Ashes to ashes, glue to glue.  Now he's just...  That was good.  See, you think that guy...  You think the horse felt that fucking guy is all limp now?  Do you think the horse felt the...  And then they talk to a dude.  Then they talk to some dude.  Never.  Well, and then he fucks her and comes all over the fucking cunt.  What a creep that guy is.  And then a little horse comes out later and I fuck it.  Now we got a montage of...  Here's two horses just in a park somewhere next to a...  Little League game.  It's weird how their necks arch kind of impossibly. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, a neck kind of...  The horse stands up like a human when it comes time to do some fucking...  Some horse fucking going on.  That's because they watched us.  Yeah.  One more.  One more.  I want to see one trying to lay the horse on its back and do it human style.  I wonder if horses do donkey punches. 
[02:20:00]  Here's the last bit of the story.  He didn't resist or fight back or deny.  Now he did kept apologizing to me.  He said, if I hurt you, ma'am, I'm sorry.  Vereen is now behind bars.  His brother says he has mental problems and may not have been taking his medicine.  I'd like to see him get some help, but I also want him kept behind bars when he's getting the help.  Really?  Here we go, yeah.  There it is. 
[02:20:30]  Well, oh my God.  How are we just watching horse fuck videos?  He did kept apologizing to me.  Did he?  You fucking past tense, not using correctly, stupid retard with a fucking horse.  Horses just don't look like they're made for fucking.  The hooves.  You don't have any hands to hold on.  You can't grab onto nothing.  Isn't that weird?  It's like they made him wrong.  Like, wouldn't they just be, wouldn't the fucking be the first thing you, when you design an animal?  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Just to make sure that you can keep making them.  You make them so that they can fuck.  Yeah, so they can fuck easier than that.  Why are they awkward when they fuck?  That should be an egg laying animal.  Yeah.  That's like, it should just be a, I know it's a mammal, but it should just be an egg laying animal.  It's not built for fucking.  Uh, what is, what is this?  Oh, they're doing that weird mouth thing when they smell, is that a Shetland pony or something?  Still hung like a motherfucker.  Horses.  Jesus Christ.  How do giraffes fuck?  Find some giraffe fucking videos. 
[02:21:30]  That's gotta be impossible.  You're not gonna find giraffes fucking, are you?  That's gotta be.  Danny finds anything.  Giraffes fucking?  Come on.  If there's fucking to be had, Danny will find it.  Come on.  Here we go.  Giraffe fucking.  Actually, they're built a little wedge-like.  This just takes seconds.  How the fuck do they get this done?  Now, the giraffe is just standing behind him.  The rocks behind them look like they're gonna fuck, too.  It's weird.  It's a strange image.  Where is this?  Like Disney's fucking animal?  Oh, here he goes. 
[02:22:00]  Hey!  Did he just shove it in and that was it?  Holy shit.  It had to be one thrust.  Look up giraffes fucking today.  One thrust that took a tenth of a second.  Wow.  He was.  Damn.  He just pushed everything forward.  What's that about?  Did you ever see that video?  A lot of people have watched it of the wild, what do you call those animals that got antlers?  Fuck.  Oh, elk or deer?  Say some kind of weird bison or something by a river in Africa and these cougars come 
[02:22:30]  and attack them.  Yeah.  Did you ever see this video?  And then they end up fighting with an alligator.  That whole thing.  It's one of the greatest things I ever saw.  The alligator comes out of like nowhere.  Yeah, but then the elk come back and then they fight back.  It's crazy.  It's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.  And there's really no way for them to win.  I forget.  No, but they do.  The elk win?  Yeah.  Against an alligator?  It's one of the coolest things I ever saw.  I'd take the alligator over the elk any day.  UFC style. 
[02:23:00]  Alligators are good grapplers.  Gotta get them on the ground.  They're not good on their feet.  Louie, she's still on TV.  What?  You know?  What?  Louie, she's still on TV.  What is she?  Yeah.  You're on pretty good terms with your dad.  Who gives a shit?  Let's hear from the elk.  Can we?  Sure.  We got some sound.  Sure.  The elk.  You've been married to somebody for 23 years and you're crazy and in love with him.  You've had children with him.  You know, it's a situation.  Nobody gives a shit.  You're one fucking human being.  We had so many tough things going on.  Oh, who cares? 
[02:23:30]  Situations that happen that, you know, we just got torn apart.  He's talking like he's the fucking president.  Like, this is how seriously we take this.  He has been doing this for a long time.  So, I think he's...  What?  Wasting America's time?  Jesus.  And she's at the point now where she just has to talk about her father.  Yeah, and they're all being so serious and we're all supposed to focus on their fucking relationship.  He bothered me that he was younger.  But your dad dated a younger woman.  True.  But when you're 34 versus 19 years old, it's a big difference. 
[02:24:00]  You know, I think kind of just common sense has to kick in.  Look at the two of them listening intently.  And I got over the age thing, but I think it's just that, you know, my gut tells me he's not good for her.  I think it's pretty obvious.  And they're talking about it on national.  This is a fucking personal relationship.  This is a news show, by the way.  Yeah, this is the news, right?  Yeah, right.  What about this?  Was there pressure?  I mean, self-imposed pressure.  You got cameras there.  They want to take pictures of something.  They want to show.  They want drama.  Was that somehow, did that influence you to create these moments? 
[02:24:30]  Good question.  Good question.  Nice work.  It's kind of embarrassing because we asked all these questions yesterday.  Yeah, of course we did.  Why wouldn't we?  But you keep claiming an album about it.  We deserve it.  That's the hag she's going to look like.  And this fucking footage, like it's newsreel footage.  Hulk is in a tuxedo with a black bandana on his head.  The album, does it bring back painful memories?  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Good.  When I listen to the song, Dear Mom, it does bring back memories.  Does it really?  Listen to it.  I'm like, I can't believe. 
[02:25:00]  You know, the song, Dear Mom.  I can't believe I felt those feelings.  You're making money off the situation.  It's still shocking because I'm like, it's my mom.  I love her.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, so let me go on this show and talk about her.  But the rest of the album's happy.  Does it bring back time?  I'm an absolutely happy person.  You can't really get me down.  Really?  What if I piss in your hair?  Will I get you down?  Fucking idiot.  Jesus Christ.  It'll be running.  I think there's two or three more episodes left.  So try to catch it.  Fucking Louis.  Yeah, it's really awesome.  We're still filming.  You're not going to be able to say Louis will take us all the shows. 
[02:25:30]  It's all this bad.  I'm sorry.  Brooke Hogan, thank you so much.  Brooke Hogan, thank you so much.  And if I could do a little shout out, go to brooksworld.com.  Okay, my website.  That's great.  What are you going to tweet about us today, Brooke?  I feel weird about my mom's relationship with it.  Here's my website.  I'm going to steal one of your Tic Tacs.  Okay, you got it.  You can have some.  It's a matter of vaginal problems.  We can do more than that.  How about a mug?  Okay, it's a picture.  Give her the works.  It was good when you said give her the works.  Lose our cameraman.  Wendy, we look at what the highlights were from yesterday's show on the Wendy Williams show. 
[02:26:00]  This guy's a douche.  She has some friendly advice to a woman in her audience.  Is that right?  I love you for watching.  Oh, this monster.  I hate the monster.  The fucking Wendy Williams monster.  You know, look at the size of this fucking tranny.  Every time she gets into an argument with her boyfriend, she expects me to call him and talk to him.  No, no, no.  Yes, and I feel very uncomfortable with that because I don't want to get involved.  Wendy Williams is a man.  I don't even understand what this is.  You tell her that you are a practicing adult, and practicing adults stay out of grown people's business, and she needs to grow up. 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  Don't you do that anymore.  I won't.  You're correct.  She's wrong.  Tell her like it is, Wendy.  She doesn't hold back.  What is going on?  We are done.  Very poor Throne.  I thought I saw The Limit years ago.  No, I know.  I thought so, so.  She tells it like it is.  I thought when those shows came on, it was like, this level won't last, but it's like 15 generations in to all of this stuff.  And still, they're just...  Yeah, when you thought back to like...  You know, I was on this fucking radio show that's probably in this building. 
[02:27:00]  Who cares?  You're beating us up?  Uh, what is this guy?  Oh, Bubba Love Sports?  Yeah, that's what it was.  Ugh.  He sucks.  Okay, so here's my experience.  He sucks.  I do radio all the time on the phone, because I'm on the road.  Last three years, constantly on the road.  So I have to do radio to support the dates.  And I never know.  I get an email saying, here's your radio itinerary for the week.  I never read it.  It comes down to, I'm walking down the street with my kids, and my phone rings, and I'm on the radio somewhere in America. 
[02:27:30]  I don't fucking know.  It doesn't really matter.  No, why would it?  No.  You know, and it's funny to me when people like, they go, hey, we're calling in from whatever, Baltimore.  Oh, oh, okay, Baltimore.  Oh, you didn't even know where we are?  No, I fucking didn't.  Why am I supposed to know that?  You think I'm training, like, Rocky all year for one date in Baltimore?  I'm doing Baltimore's one in fucking five dates that week.  One out of the five cities, yeah.  But anyway, Bub, I guess, so I get a call. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, we're coming to you in a minute.  I don't even know what show.  I go, okay, I guess I'm on the radio.  So then I'm on hold for a while, and then this guy comes on, who I don't know who the fuck he is, and he goes, hey, sorry, we made you wait for a while there.  But we had the Hulkster on, and I go, okay, I don't even, I don't, I'm not really aware that Hulk is what he's doing or whatever.  Yeah.  So it's this guy, Bubba, the love sponge, and he goes, yeah, yeah, you got to understand that we made you wait because of Hulk, right? 
[02:28:30]  I mean, you get why we would do that, wouldn't you?  And I go, listen, I wasn't even really aware I was waiting.  I just, yeah, I'm not listening.  I was listening to hold music.  I wasn't listening to you, or, and he goes, yeah, okay, but what's your take on what's going on with Hulk?  Hulk, and I go, I don't know what you're talking about.  What do you mean you don't know?  The Hulkster is getting screwed by this gold digger.  And I go, I really don't know anything about that, and I don't really pay attention to what's happening to celebrities. 
[02:29:00]  I don't care.  And then he gets offended, and he says, oh, oh, I get it.  Oh, I get it.  You comedians get to just leap around a stage being a jackass while I have to sit here and be responsible to my listeners.  Are you shitting me?  No, I'm not kidding.  What?  Like, he takes it as, like, a personal responsibility to know what's going on in Hulk's personal life.  While you have the bells on your hat and your toes. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm just being a douche on stage, and this guy is, like, fucking holding up a standard.  Yeah, we can list all the responsible things he's done with his radio show, by the way.  Yeah.  He's a hack.  Hack hillbool.  No, it went downhill.  It turned into him hanging up on me and going, you're no Joe Rogan, and then he hung up on me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was just ridiculous.  Well, you're not.  I'm not a Joe Rogan at all.  Joe Rogan will kick your ass.  We're very different human beings in a lot of ways.  You're no Joe Rogan, because you suck. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, and then I called back, and we got into it.  It was fucking stupid.  What an asshole he is.  But that, the thing, yeah, I mean, the whole dispute I had with him that ended up hanging,  I didn't even care about that.  The thing that I remember is the idea that that's some kind of a serious responsibility.  Yeah.  To be up on all this reality show shit.  Yeah.  He's like, he's like being, like, he deserves the Edward R. Murrow Award.  Award for telling people what the Hulk stirs up to.  For really being prepared for the Hulk interview. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, I got.  Fucking asshole.  What a douche.  I got what was said.  What was it?  So you call back.  Yeah.  Hello?  And Louie says, listen, man, if you have to be such a little baby that you just have  to have your phone, has to always work, and no one can say anything to you, and you  make your little cracks as you hang up on me like you can't say it and keep me on and see  what I have to say about it.  I was trying to.  You know, you were being cowardly and babyish, childish, and very, very silly.  That's what I would say.  Now, if I were acting childish, babyish, and silly, I wouldn't have allowed you to call  me that because I knew this was going to happen. 
[02:31:00]  You allowed me back on because I called in.  You didn't plan this.  I don't have to put you back on.  In my initial plan, I changed it midstream, bitch, and I decided to put you back on.  Louie.  Oh, okay.  I give you credit for that.  Okay.  Thank you.  You have a great day, and good luck in your shows.  And then Louie fucking says, okay, you're no Howard Stern.  And then this fucking hillbilly goes, no, but I work for him, and you're no Joe Rogan, 
[02:31:30]  and you don't work for him, bitch.  Why would I work for Joe Rogan?  Why would you work for Joe Rogan, my life?  And then he goes, and your show got canceled after a year, and I'm glad.  Really?  You're glad that a show like fucking Louie's got canceled?  That was a great show.  It had nothing to do with it.  I'm glad I got canceled, too.  I wouldn't be fucking nominated for an Emmy if I did, if I was so lucky, Louie.  The show has a very good following.  They just decided to pass it.  It doesn't matter.  It's too bad.  Yeah, you're past that, obviously.  It doesn't matter, yeah.  And you're now Emmy nominated for your stand-up special.  If Bubba didn't have his fat head buried so far up Howard's asshole, he wouldn't be working  for this company anyway, so shut the fuck up. 
[02:32:00]  The reason he got mad at me is because, you know, my bit that I did on Conan about everything's  great and nobody's happy and about airplanes and how...  It's a brilliant bit.  Nobody cares anymore that we have amazing phones and airplanes.  Yeah.  It was just a bit that caught fire, and it was huge.  So his guy that works on his show, Bubba, he really loved the bit and asked me to do  it.  So I started...  He was like, tell me, do some of it, like on the air.  Okay, so I start talking about how phones, you know, you should be happy that they work. 
[02:32:30]  And Bubba goes, well, I don't know, when my phone doesn't work on a...  When I get mad when my phone doesn't work, I'm going to pay a customer.  So he just...  This isn't a discussion.  No, but also he walked right into the teeth of the bit.  The bit is what whiners people are.  So he starts whining.  Jesus.  So he goes, I go over a bridge every morning on the way to work, and the phone cracks out  halfway across the bridge.  And I go, you can't stop talking for during a ride across a bridge?  Like, what was so important?  Who even cared what you were saying when it cracked out? 
[02:33:00]  What is it?  He goes, wow, I was making a deal.  I was making money for America.  I'm like, no, you weren't.  You were whining about something else to somebody else.  I went after him.  Because that's how the bit works.  And he got really mad and said, yeah, you're no Joe Rogan.  And he cut me off.  And then he bitched to his people that I was...  He was like, yeah, well, don't do your bit to me.  This is my show.  He's just one of those spoiled brat radio guys.  Oh, yeah, he's an asshole.  Don't do your comedy at me.  This is my show.  You know, he just got insulted, personally. 
[02:33:30]  You know what it is with him?  He's failed for so long trying to make a name for himself.  I don't know nothing about it.  He never really got that name for himself that he's so bitter and miserable to anyone  with any bit of success.  He did make a name for himself.  Bubba the Love Sponge.  Yeah, what a great name is that to make for yourself.  What a great name.  It's his legal name.  Literally made a name for himself.  It's his legal name, too.  And it's a stupid name.  Horrible.  What an asshole.  No, that's why I said you're such a baby that you need your phone to work and no one 
[02:34:00]  can say anything to you.  Now we get it.  Totally.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  You don't like doing radio shows, do you, though?  I love it when it's fun.  Yeah.  It's a great way to spend time when it's a good time.  This is the only show I actually enjoy doing.  I mean, I don't when you get, but I mean, out of all the radio shows you do, the percentage  of shows that are fun to do one.  I mean, literally, I probably do 100 one year and you're you guys is the one that's good.  Literally one percent.  One out of one hundred.  Jesus. 
[02:34:30]  No, they there's some.  They all have that like pet format thing that you got to do.  You got to you got to play to their rules and everything.  It's like, fuck, no.  Just come in and be funny.  There's people that know, you know, when I did that movie, Ricky Gervais's movie, the  this side, well, it's called the invention of lying now.  But the Entertainment Tonight or one of those shows came.  I don't even know which one extra, whatever.  Yeah.  One of it doesn't matter.  Doesn't fucking matter.  No.  And they asked to talk to all of us. 
[02:35:00]  So they talked to me and Ricky and Jennifer Garner was there.  So they did me and Ricky first and I went up and just got into shit with the woman.  I ended up getting in an argument with this lady.  She's just asking me.  I'm like, what is that supposed to mean?  Like, I don't understand how the thing operated.  You know, she was like something about said something about my weight or something.  I'm like, you're going to call me fat on your show.  You know, what's wrong with you?  And she's like, what?  And it was a mess. 
[02:35:30]  And then Ricky sat down.  Ricky's a pretty smart guy.  And he ends up going, what on earth is that supposed to mean?  And Ricky gets in a fight with a woman.  Pardon me.  That's all right.  What happened?  Shit.  Where did she come from?  Holy fuck.  A person in the anus.  Who is she?  She from the front, too.  Oh, my God.  Dude, she was really cute.  Oh, my God.  You know who she is, Danny?  Who is that?  Yeah, find out.  Do some recon.  Find out everything.  Find out everything.  You all right, Lou? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  The back of your head just hit the microphone.  You all right?  Oh, do you know?  Of course, Sam knows.  Sam knows?  Sam knows.  Who is that?  That's one of Covino and Rich's intern.  I think it's Covino's cousin.  Oh, my God.  Well, how about we get her to intern for our show?  Yeah.  Do you guys want me to go grab her?  Why don't you make her the program director?  I mean, and bring her in on the show.  I'm just kidding, guys.  Yeah, let's talk to her.  Let's talk to her for a couple of seconds.  We're going to fuck up everything.  I didn't know that.  Okay, let's talk to her for a couple of seconds.  Let's see this. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at Sam running.  He's running with you.  Sam doesn't know how to run.  He's running with those feet, too.  He's got floppy feet.  He's got, like, duck feet.  It's like clown shoes when he runs.  Oh, we're going to actually see him intercept.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at this.  Here comes the intercept.  It's 10 miles.  We're already out of breath.  He's out of breath already.  Completely across the building.  Like, hey, could you help me and Anthony want to talk to you?  Would you come on the show for a minute?  Can you come over?  Would you want to talk to you for a minute?  Yeah, she came walking by this way. 
[02:37:00]  I saw it coming through this way and was like, who the fuck is that?  You're going to make a move?  Make a play?  Make a little play?  I don't know.  Are you dating?  Sort of not the last few, like, months or so, but I was, yeah.  You're doing all right out there?  Yeah, man.  Young girls like weird guys.  It turns out.  I learned a lot from divorce.  Yeah.  Young women take it in the ass. 
[02:37:30]  I had no idea that shit was going on.  When I was a kid, it was like, I don't know, maybe if you, like, a woman that was a hooker  and now she's 45, she might let you fuck her in the ass.  Yeah.  But women in their 20s, women in their early 20s are like, it's just a prerequisite.  Change the subject.  Hi.  Hi.  We got it.  How are you?  What's your name?  Good, how are you?  What's your name?  My name's Jamie.  Jamie.  Hi, Jamie.  We had a real important show going on and then you walked by and we don't even remember  what we were talking about. 
[02:38:00]  You derailed the program.  Yeah.  Oh, you're sweet.  Thanks.  You derailed the show.  You came walking by this way and it was like, I'm not even wearing heels today.  Who the fuck is that?  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, it's great to meet you guys.  Who is that?  Now, where the hell did you come from?  I actually.  Where in holy hell did you emerge from?  Where in god damn hell did you.  Yeah, basically most of the broads around here, not much to look at.  Well, I was interning with another channel and now I'm with my cousin, Steve Covino on  the Covino and Rich show.  Really? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I'm having a good time too.  Where's your cousin?  Because we're making a trade.  Sam, you're done.  Is he overprotective?  Sam, you're done.  I would love to work with you guys.  You know what?  I'll give you my schedule.  How easy that is, fellas.  Sam, why don't you get on mic and say goodbye to the O.P. and Anthony audience?  Yeah, go ahead, Sam.  Look, I'm very valuable to this show.  Say goodbye, Sam.  I'm very happy to see it alive, Sam.  Just goodbye, just goodbye.  Just goodbye.  Goodbye.  Kenny, where's Kenny?  Drag Sam out.  No, I want to go.  My fucking afro.  Kenny, you know how much I do.  Say goodbye to the audience.  Get him out.  Just get him out.  Goodbye, Sam. 
[02:39:00]  You're done.  You're done.  Have fun on the Maxim channel.  So long.  There you go.  Bye, Sam.  So how long have you been with them?  Oh, I felt so bad.  Don't feel bad.  Just probably a couple weeks, I think.  Yeah, because I haven't seen you around.  You'd have been, like, noticed.  You think?  Yeah, you'd have been noticed.  You don't know you're hot?  You got...  You got to know you're hot.  She knows.  She goes to, like, a bar and everybody's like...  She's not wearing a sweater.  Right.  She knows she looks good.  Like, I know I'm an asshole.  You got to know you're hot.  Well, thank you. 
[02:39:30]  I try to keep, you know, a good head on my shoulders.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to lurk around, you know, the studios.  I have to try.  You got a boyfriend?  No, I don't, actually.  Ooh.  I don't.  Oh, do you go out a lot?  I try to.  I work a lot now since I'm interning here.  That's good.  Yeah, so I bartend.  You have a regular job, too?  You bartend?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, cool.  So it's kind of like going out.  Only the guys can't really hop behind the bar and get you, you know?  Well, they can.  They must just, like...  They got to keep behind the bar.  It's a rule.  I think every girl I've ever gone out with has been a bartender, and they, like... 
[02:40:00]  It's good money.  Good, quick money.  But some of the guys you're dealing with there are, whoa, they just do not let up.  They don't let up.  It's true.  I used to be a shot girl, like the cocktail waitress thing, and that was a lot more invasive.  I'm like, yeah, sure, you can see my butt cheeks if you give me a hundred bucks, you  know?  Yeah, grabbing.  It's terrible.  It's really bad.  Is that price still on the market?  Yeah, it's a little bit, it's a little more invasive.  Yeah?  But I like bartending, though.  It's good.  Where, where, what, like... 
[02:40:30]  How old are you?  Not exactly, but...  I live at the Jersey Shore.  Jersey Shore?  Yeah.  I'm 24.  24?  Yeah.  That's a surprise, isn't it?  Yeah.  I get mistaken for you.  She looks like 19.  Yeah, you look like 19.  Yeah, yeah, you're probably a proof of all time.  It's been the one I'm wearing, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, if I have, like, a shirt with the cleave showing, people are like, oh, you're, like,  a little bit older.  I've got to take an awkward picture for you.  So, yeah.  Okay.  I've got to let everyone know.  Yeah.  Also, could you take a picture?  She's, like, a celebrity.  This is hilarious. 
[02:41:00]  I know.  Where are all these pictures going?  I put it on my classmates and say you're my girlfriend.  Yeah.  Okay.  I should have worn heels today.  See?  I should have tried to look fine.  No, it's okay.  This is what happened to Anthony.  He wants everybody to think.  Let me just get one for him.  So, I put it on classmates, and I have a different girlfriend.  Should I bite his nipple?  Ooh.  Wow.  Well, if you want.  Sure.  Thank you.  Oh, you guys, thank you so much.  Let's go hang out.  Oh, okay.  You want to meet Seth Rogen?  We actually, I saw him, but he walked right past me.  Why would he walk past me?  Wow, he must be a homo. 
[02:41:30]  I don't know.  I think he was in a rush.  Seth Rogen's a homo.  Are you guys interviewing him now?  I think we're supposed to.  Are you?  We might blow him off for you, though.  Cool.  I would love to hang out and just shake his hand.  He's my favorite.  Why not?  I came in early today just to meet him.  Did you?  I did.  And he didn't even notice you?  No.  He's your favorite what?  I think it's so jaded.  He's my favorite, like, comedian.  I don't know, you know, actor.  They get jaded.  But he's funny as hell, so I like him.  Is he still your favorite, even though he didn't say anything to you when you walked by?  I don't know.  It depends. 
[02:42:00]  He's got second chance.  If he doesn't, then I don't know.  Louis had a very good observation.  Louis is dating, and you had a nice observation about a young girl.  Did he?  Yeah.  Didn't you, Lou, or you haven't?  I was telling them that I was.  Or do you have to have to use it right now?  I'm interested.  Are you?  I am, yeah.  For real.  It turns out, and I didn't expect this, that young girls take it in the ass now and again.  And I didn't know that.  You know what?  They really do.  They do, right?  They really do. 
[02:42:30]  They do.  See, I had a feeling I could say that to you.  It's terrible, because I...  It's terrible.  Like, it's happening out in the street.  I wouldn't talk about it.  I wouldn't be like, hey, guys, I got it in the butt yesterday, you know?  Keep it to yourself, right?  Yeah.  Well, it's just that they offer it up a lot more easily.  And it's like I got an extra cigarette, like, offered like that.  Like, hey, I'd take it in the ass, by the way, if you're interested.  I know.  It's so strange to me.  And I'm like...  It's the pornography industry.  They remind us.  I think that's true.  Oh, my God.  I think that's why.  And guys always ask, too, you know? 
[02:43:00]  Do they?  I never asked once a girl if she'd let me fuck her in the ass.  And I haven't done it still, because I don't really...  Stay in for Seth Rohn.  I love that that's the line.  All right, cool.  Thanks for grabbing me.  No, no, stay right there.  Bring in Seth, yes.  Oh, okay.  That's what makes you a gentleman, is that you don't ask a woman to let you fuck her in  the ass.  That's a really nice line.  Would it ever be a problem?  Hey, what's up, Delilah?  Good morning.  Good to see you, man.  Maybe give me a call and hang out.  Who?  You, me.  Oh, no, no, let's hang out.  Would that be cool?  Absolutely, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Would you put your number in my phone?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  We got to explain to Seth Rohn.  And of course, you know Louis C.K., O.P. and Anthony.  Did I walk into a date rape?  Can I do it afterwards?  It's a soft date rape.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  Because I'll just...  I can call it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Call it.  Okay.  It's easier.  It's more of a lunch date rape.  We just learned...  Sorry, Seth.  Trying, you know.  We just learned that she's a new intern on the Maxim channel.  Yes.  We just fired this guy to bring her aboard.  They dragged him out. 
[02:44:00]  And Louis just got some info out of her that she agrees that young women take it in the  ass.  So, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  I found my home, guys.  Apparently, yeah.  Yeah, they do.  And now they've exchanged numbers.  They do.  They take it right in the dirty hole.  But, yeah, I just want to...  You know, because I figure if you're...  You know, you don't have a boyfriend or anything.  No, I don't.  Go out and hang out.  Oh, and she's a big fan of yourself, too.  I am.  You are my absolute favorite.  You're her favorite.  I came in early to work today, so I...  Really?  Oh, that's...  But you walked right by her a few minutes ago.  I did.  If I could somehow pawn this off to you guys, I would. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know how to do it.  Pawn the pawn.  She was bummed that you didn't notice her when she walked by.  I'm sorry.  No, I...  In a jujitsu-type redirection, I can...  I totally agree.  Do some Jedi mind trick.  Exactly.  Help out.  You got a question for Seth before you leave there?  Yeah.  Will you go out on a date with me?  I would like him.  Wow.  That was pretty nice, right?  He has a girlfriend.  She's single.  No, he's not, though.  I knew this.  I thought you were going out with Anthony.  She's allowed?  I did my Instagram.  Anthony asked her out seconds ago. 
[02:45:00]  I know.  Literally.  I'm sorry, dude.  I don't quite know.  Seth Rogen.  I'm Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you lose to Seth Rogen every time.  We lose to Seth Rogen every time.  Guys on a lot of very popular movies.  I don't have a show, though.  I understand.  It's true.  It's nothing like a show.  It's nothing like a show.  Steady work.  You have movies.  He's in some movies, but you have a show.  I have a show.  That's the difference?  That's the difference.  Yeah, on a daily basis, I can pretty much just say what I want mad.  That's great, man.  I can't do that.  No, I'd rather go to a premiere of a huge movie and go, yeah, I'm in that. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  That seems a little more important than this horse shit we do every day.  You must be just thrilled to death to be going around like fucking just being whored  out to stations all day long.  Yeah, it's true.  Those Maxim guys wear some tight shirts.  That's what I've learned today.  They do wear tight shirts.  Yeah.  Do they think they're the girls?  I know.  They've been confused.  You're not doing the photo shoot this month, fella. 
[02:46:00]  Now, the new movie.  Funny People.  Funny People.  We were talking about movies, though, about comedians.  Yeah.  Don't usually do very well because people have a hard time.  Don't give a fuck about us.  Yeah, it's not interesting.  People have a hard time playing comedians.  Yeah.  Unless they are working comedians.  Louis will attest to that.  He saw us try.  No, he was good, though.  I saw him at the improv.  I could see you doing that, though.  You did it, too, right? 
[02:46:30]  I did.  I started out doing stand-up.  I saw it.  It's easy for you.  That's the difference.  But when you get someone, because what I always think of is that fucking movie with Tom  Hanks.  Oh, Punchline.  We all talked about it.  You had to.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what's funny, the one scene we always talked about is such bullshit in that they all have  lockers at the comedy club, and we all talked about, like, we just can't have lockers, and  then we literally showed up to the set, and there was fucking lockers in it.  Really?  Yeah.  We were like, what the hell is this?  And we covered it up with, like, a soda machine or something.  But, yeah, I mean, we were really scared.  I mean, it was hard, you know, for me. 
[02:47:00]  I mean, I was supposed to, I had done stand-up, so actually, for me, it wasn't that hard.  It was more like just writing a shitload of jokes for the movie that was the challenge,  but, like, Jonah Hill had never done stand-up and had to look like he was good at it and  been doing it for years, and one night, me and Jonah went to the improv, and we were  both like, oh, that, like, we did our sets.  We were like, oh, that wasn't bad, and then Louie went up and, like, just fucking annihilated  it.  It was crazy.  And me and Jonah were just in the back, just like, oh, shit, that's so much, what are we  doing?  Why are we, I was saying, like, I felt like, I felt like how, like, like, an actor must 
[02:47:30]  play when they play, like, a baseball player, and then, like, A-Rod shows up, and they're  like, oh, there's real baseball players here.  In the movie, they've been making it look like I could hit a home run.  But what's funny is that Jonah did stand-up for, like, six months for the fucking movie,  and then he's literally, if you see it, he's in it for, like, four and a half seconds  to make stand-up.  After all that work?  After all that, it's not even a joke he wrote, it's a joke Sandler wrote.  Really?  I feel so bad about it.  And he's never going to do it again, right?  Oh, never, never, ever going to do it again. 
[02:48:00]  You killed him.  He always killed him.  Louie, you took all his confidence away.  Louie crushed him.  Well, I remember that night you guys came in, and it was like, um...  You had to assert your power over us.  Yeah, no, definitely.  No, when you guys were on, I was definitely like, no, okay, let's...  Let's show these asses.  This is how it's done.  But...  Because you know how actors are when comedians go into a movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Because Jimmy's told me a lot that when he walks up, it's like, oh, the comedian's here 
[02:48:30]  to do his little funny part, and he doesn't know he's not an actor, so he doesn't understand.  So it must be nice to just...  Which is usually the case, too.  Well, it's always the case.  I don't know what the fuck you're doing.  Jimmy's problem is he doesn't ever know what to do with his hands when he's acting.  That's really funny.  Like, put it in your pocket or just keep it straight up like you're being held up in the  Old West.  That's why I hold things.  Just always hold things.  Yeah, just hold something all the time.  No, but I remember Seth actually looked like a stand-up when he was doing it.  Yeah.  He looked like a comedian. 
[02:49:00]  Like, his brain was functioning like a comedian, but Jonah was...  Jonah was freaking out.  Full of tics, and he kept swinging his arms around, and he wouldn't let go of the fucking  mic stand, and it was a mess.  I remember you were talking to Jonah after, trying to encourage him, and all you could  muster was, at the end, you said, nice to meet you, to the audience.  That was very polite.  Yeah, that was great.  That was good.  You did compliment his jokes.  Merely his demeanor on stage.  Yeah, at least if you...  And then it was polite.  The best part was when he left is what you're saying. 
[02:49:30]  You weren't funny at all, but you were not rude to the audience.  Rude to the audience.  A cordial gentleman.  That's nice.  You were cordial in your bombing.  About as good as a God.  You have another question for Seth?  Yeah, I was just kidding, by the way.  Oh, it's okay.  I know you have a girlfriend, so I'm not trying to...  Oh, no, don't worry, don't worry.  It was just lovely.  You want to go out with Louis C.K.?  Anyone else?  No.  No, Louis C.K.  Jesus.  My other question...  Come on with me.  Gosh.  I'm sorry.  Where did you get your start?  That's where I want to know, because I'm trying to break into this radio industry, and I want  to know...  You're doing good. 
[02:50:00]  I hate to break it to you, but you're on the radio right now.  I'm literally on an exact bar.  Sometimes you just have to look around to see that you've made it.  You've done it.  What was your funniest starting moment?  I don't know.  I started doing stand-up.  To me, that was a very obtainable career path.  I thought if you could get up in a comedy club, that seemed like something that was possible,  and it just seemed like if you were funny, then you would go out to other comedy clubs. 
[02:50:30]  So I think by being on the radio, you got a really great jump start for ultimately being  on the radio.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  That's insane.  Did you just...  Were you doing stand-up and then just started going on auditions, or what the fuck?  Yeah, like I wasn't...  Near the end of high school, it became clear I wasn't going to graduate, because I just  smoked weed all day instead of going to class, so I decided I should probably try  to get a job.  You didn't graduate high school?  No, I didn't graduate high school.  So I decided I should start trying to audition for things, and I got an agent through doing 
[02:51:00]  stand-up, and then Freaks and Geeks was like the second audition I went on, and that's  how I met Judd, and that was like 12 years ago almost, and I've literally been working  with him ever since then.  And that was your overnight success.  I mean, if you consider a show that got canceled after 10 episodes, an overnight success.  But between my experience of you was Freaks and Geeks...  Nothing for eight years.  Yeah.  And then your whole face for Knocked Up.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, because I remember you were in smaller parts than those other movies, but 
[02:51:30]  that was like...  Yeah.  So what the fuck did you do for eight years?  I, uh...  We did another show called Undeclared, which I was a writer for, and then I started writing...  Oh, that was on Fox, right?  Yeah, it was on Fox.  See, I forgot that existed.  Oh, many people did.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Then I just...  I would help Judd rewrite movies, and then I wrote for Sasha Baron...  I wrote for the Allie G Show for the second season.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  And, uh, I was just kind of like a writer, like a writer for hire, and then 40-O Virgin  coincidentally just kind of came up and Judd put me in it. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Did you want to write, or was it one of those, like, goddamn, like, I'm sick of doing this,  I want to get in front of the camera?  No, honestly, like, when you're...  I mean, there was very little precedent for guys like me.  And I literally remember, like, looking at guys like Vincent D'Onofrio and being like,  maybe, like, he did it, maybe I could do it, but no, I never assumed that they would ever  want me in front of the camera.  I was more than happy being a writer.  I mean, that...  Did you do stand-up during any of that time, or just writing?  I stopped pretty much when I moved to L.A., because the game, it was just so different. 
[02:52:30]  It's hard to get on stage.  Like, also, I just remember thinking it was so loud.  That was, like, really the weirdest, like, I remember thinking, like, all these stand-ups  are so loud.  Yeah, that's true.  Like, in Vancouver, everyone, you just wrote your jokes, and you told them it was very  much about the writing of the joke, and, like, kind of just making the other comics laugh.  And then I got out to L.A., and I was like, oh, all these people just want to be on  sitcoms, and they just want to, like, show instantly, like, what the show would be.  And it's like, oh, I'm a Mexican guy, but I got white parents, like, and, like, I just  remember, like, thinking I could never do that, and so I just kind of stopped. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, it was smart.  No, it is.  It's very desperate comedy in L.A.  Yeah.  And it is like that.  Everybody's first five jokes is who the members of their family are, and you go, oh, I see,  that's who you want to see.  Yeah, it's like, here's what this sitcom would be.  Yeah, he's literally casting, and they're doing impressions of the people and shit, and then  I had jokes about, like, waiting for the bus, and, like, it was just like...  But what's the show about?  Yeah, exactly.  A guy waiting for the fucking bus?  You get well-received in the movies.  Did you ever think, getting in front of the camera, that you'd have the ability to actually 
[02:53:30]  do it?  I mean, because you say you didn't really think you'd be chosen to do that because, I  don't know, what, the way you look?  Do you think...  No, I mean, I was not good at it at first, honestly.  Like, if you go back and watch old Freaks and Geeks episodes, like, I really sucked at the  beginning.  Like, it was a real learning curve for me.  Like, I have a hard time watching myself.  Like, I was not good at it when I first started.  I definitely got better as time went on, you know?  And I did more and more stuff.  So, yeah, no, I never assumed. 
[02:54:00]  Like, I would watch myself on those Freaks and Geeks episodes and be like, what the fuck?  Why are they doing this?  Yeah, like...  Never acting again.  My voice just sounded so weird and loud, and, like, it just seemed very strange.  Do you look at message boards and criticism of yourself and shit?  Because...  I do sometimes.  It's really entertaining.  Well, what's funny is, like, someone's like, look at the funny people reviews.  And I went online, and I, like, I only read the bad ones.  Like, it's literally all...  Now, you skim through a brilliant...  Yeah, brilliant genius, and then it's like, Seth Rogen's a useless idiot.  And it's like, oh, wow. 
[02:54:30]  Give me more.  It is fascinating to picture a person really, like, typing hard on the keys that they hate  you and stuff.  Just mad.  Yeah, yeah.  So mad.  I mean, it's really amazing.  They get angry.  People genuinely get angry at somebody.  Well, it's the only passion anymore, is hate.  I mean, nobody really loves anything.  No, it's true.  It's never, like, this movie is wonderful.  It's all like, yeah, it works, except for this fucking asshole in the middle of it.  Yeah, exactly.  Or they're always just indifferent to it.  They're always just like, meh. 
[02:55:00]  Like, yeah.  Oh, God.  No, it goes...  All our standards go from C to F.  That's it.  Yeah.  It's either passing.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's good.  Or fucking piece of shit.  It's not like, this is brilliant.  This is brilliant.  I know.  You're getting quite the little Rat Pack going with the same, you know, some...  Same assholes in every movie.  Same assholes in every movie.  Yeah.  I know. 
[02:55:30]  It's annoying.  What's funny is, like, I remember I was at, like, a test screening for Meet the Fuckers,  which was, like, the 15 millionth movie that Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson were in together.  And, like, the director after the screening was like, who's just sick of seeing these guys  in movies together?  And I was like, I am.  I never want to see these fucking guys together again.  And now me and Joda, this is, like, our 19th movie together.  And, like, I'm sorry.  We did it.  We fell into the trap.  I mean, if it works, what the fuck, you know?  Right on.  You just look at each other and go, when the fuck is this gravy train going to be on?  Exactly.  I know. 
[02:56:00]  We do all the time.  And that's why, yeah.  Spend now, right?  Yeah.  Bob Hope and, what's his name?  Bing Crosby.  Bing.  Yeah, exactly.  I was watching a movie with Charlton Heston about a circus.  I forget what it's called.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that one.  But it's a serious movie.  It's, like, a serious movie about a circus.  And there's a scene.  It's, like, a first mistake.  Yeah, exactly.  And there's a woman on the high wire.  Yeah.  There's a woman on the trapeze, and she's doing something really serious and very scary.  And they pan the audience, looking up at her. 
[02:56:30]  And in the audience is Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.  Really?  Looking up, looking all scared like everybody else.  And that's it.  They're just in a shot.  That's a cameo.  And it must have been, like, they were in the lot, just fucking around.  Jump in.  Jump in.  Yeah.  That was the one where, also, Charlton Heston had that old-time good body.  Yeah.  Where it was back then, it was good.  But now, it, like, wouldn't watch him.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  He was the macho guy. 
[02:57:00]  The hairy chest.  The smile with the big teeth.  Like, women found him a sex symbol and attractive, and you see him in Planet of the Apes.  It's just like a sex.  He looks like a guy at a hardware store.  Really?  That guy?  We've got to ask Seth, did you turn Kevin Smith on a smoking pot?  Apparently, I did.  Because Kevin comes in a lot.  He's kind of a friend of the show.  That's what I've been told.  He hasn't, I mean, yeah, I mean, he hadn't smoked weed in a long time, and then we did  Zack and Miri together, and I'm a bad influence, I guess, and at the end of the movie, I was 
[02:57:30]  just, you know, he had, like, cut the movie together almost by the time we finished shooting,  so I was like, let's just smoke a bunch of weed and watch what we got.  And then, apparently, he never stopped.  He never stopped.  He is way in now.  Yeah, he's like, really?  So he started smoking pot like in his 40s?  Yeah, exactly.  That's crazy.  It's really quite weird.  He got through adolescence and all that shit, and then he's...  Well, I think he had smoked earlier on and then quit and stopped, but then any time you  bump into a Canadian, you start smoking pot again.  Yeah, exactly.  You just have to smoke weed. 
[02:58:00]  I never thought Canada was like this.  He does.  He's got kids.  Yeah, yeah.  He does?  He has a daughter, yeah.  Daughter, right?  Yeah, daughter.  Wife.  But he says, man, Seth got me on this path.  I was talking to him recently.  He's like, you know, the best thing about now is I don't care about anything.  I'm like, good.  I'm glad I did that for you.  I used to worry about things.  Well, Vancouver is very pot heavy.  There's like a haze over the city with pot smoke.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's totally acceptable.  It was really weird moving to L.A. where it was not accepted, and I got arrested for it 
[02:58:30]  because you can't just smoke weed everywhere here.  What the fuck?  But you kind of can again now because now they have prescriptions and shit.  So it's kind of, it's back on the table, guys.  Thank God.  Right on.  Were you pissed off at the title bullshit with Zack and Mary?  It was like.  Yeah, Harvey Weinstein's a real motherfucker.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, that guy.  That guy.  Go, man.  Go, girl.  Wow.  Yeah, he decided to change the title the week before the movie came out.  What was the name of the movie? 
[02:59:00]  It was Zack and Mary make a porno, and then they just started advertising it as Zack and  Mary.  Which word does that mean?  Period.  That doesn't mean anything.  Like a Katherine Heigl movie?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, you're in a game.  I know.  He's like a bad one.  Jesus.  He's a totally honest mistake.  I'll take that.  Like a Katherine Heigl.  Like some asshole in a Katherine Heigl movie.  That's a fucking dickhead in a Katherine Heigl.  Some hapless piece of shit sending Nick to Katherine Heigl. 
[02:59:30]  Jesus Christ.  I can live with that.  We're running out of time.  That was a good fucking movie, though.  That wasn't a Katherine Heigl movie.  Thank you.  That was a Seth Rogen movie.  It was.  And then she went and made those other ones.  But that was that movie.  Then she made those.  That movie made me cry.  We had one problem with that movie that we discussed.  Knocked up?  She didn't fucking go topless.  I know.  Which was weird that she's doing those sex scenes with a bra on.  Yeah, it's weird.  What the fuck was that about?  You got any inside scoop on that?  She had a good lawyer.  I don't know, man. 
[03:00:00]  That's all I was showing my kids.  My ass was out.  All I could think was, like, she has a better lawyer than I do.  You could see my fucking sphincter in this movie.  And totally unnecessarily.  You don't even see her areola in the fucking thing.  That was the only problem we had with the movie.  That was a really fucking good movie.  Yeah, it was true.  That was really good.  We're going to lose Seth in a few minutes, and we haven't even talked about funny people.  I know.  Now, is it a serious movie?  Is it a funny movie getting, like, mixed signals on this one?  I personally think it's funny.  I mean, there's definitely serious scenes in it, but to me, it plays as a comedy. 
[03:00:30]  I mean, it gets laughs throughout.  I would not.  I don't go see serious movies, personally.  I mean, I'm the last guy to go see the fucking Changeling, you know.  So, I mean, it's a movie I would go see, so I would say it's a comedy.  Right on.  To me, the best parts are, you know, the parts about the stand-up comics and about the kind of me and my roommates are all kind of trying to break into comedy.  We're all in competition with one another, and that's shit that's, like, literally directly out of my life.  So, to me, it's a real comedy. 
[03:01:00]  And Adam Sandler, just a prick to work with, right?  He's a real asshole.  Tough man.  Yeah.  Is it out yet?  It comes out tomorrow.  It comes out tomorrow.  I want to see it.  I'm really nervous for you to see it.  I didn't know it was about that.  I really am.  I'll be honest.  Well, but that is interesting, though, the life of it, because I lived with a comedian, too, when I was starting out in Boston.  And I lived with David Cross for a while.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But before we lived together, I lived, and we were competitive.  Dave and I were, you know, friends for years. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  But, and when we lived together, it was like a, I mean, it was almost gay, because I was so happy.  Yeah.  Because we were such good friends.  And then we found a situation where he lost a roommate and I moved in, and then we started hating each other.  Because I got, started making a living at Comedy First, and he was a mess, a fucking foot messenger in Boston in the winter.  And he'd come home after a long day, and I'd still be asleep, because I'd still stand up for living, and he hated me for it.  That's exactly what you, that is literally the dynamic that's in the movie, in it. 
[03:02:00]  Like, Jason Schwartzman's character's on, like, a really shitty sitcom, and he just rubs the money in our face.  Like, Jonah's, like, a regular at the improv, and I can't get on at the improv, and we all kind of fuck each other over.  No, that's what, and Anthony Clark was the first guy that we knew that started making real money.  And he used to show us his checks to be an asshole.  Oh, literally, that's the scene in the movie, man.  So, that makes me really want to see it.  I mean, I, you know, you guys on stage is, it is, but you know what, though?  If you pull it off, it's hilarious to me.  That took me 25 years to become a really good comedian. 
[03:02:30]  And for this guy, it's, like, two years plus Judd Apatow directing.  And he's there.  We have editing.  It's a lot of editing.  Yeah, it's awesome.  If you pull it off, that's awesome.  I'm very nervous for you to see it.  It's all the comics, honestly.  Like, they're the, it scares me.  I mean, because, I mean, honestly, like, I generally, you know, don't have that much personal investment in these movies.  Like, you know, if high school kids don't like Superbad, it's like, yeah, fuck you, you know. 
[03:03:00]  To me, it was funny.  But, like, when you're really trying to make a movie about comedy and comedians, like, that's a lot of scrutiny to put yourself under.  Well, it's a ballsy thing to do.  I know.  And I know if someone else did it, I'd be the first guy to be like, fuck you.  How can you try to qualify what we do like that?  You're going to be bumping into these people, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, how was the movie?  You know, I saw the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I liked your locker.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to wrap up.  Yeah, we got to wrap up.  Funny people's out tomorrow.  We got in trouble.  You don't really have to promote this thing.  It looks like it's going to be a hit.  Promotes itself, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Well, it's getting self-promoting.  Rotten Tomatoes giving a good review, so 71% positive.  That's nice.  I'm going to go see it.  It's a nice number.  Yeah, we're all going to go see it.  Not bad.  Thank you.  Well, man, Seth.  Yeah, man.  Thanks.  Cheers, gentlemen.  Please come down.  I will.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Next movie.  Exactly.  All right, we'll be back.  See you, guys.  Fucking Louis C.K.  That's what I say today.  Opie and Anthony.  Fucking, that Catherine Hagel line. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, my God.  During the Seth Rogen interview was one for the ages.  I really, that was totally honest.  Yeah.  Because I see that poster of her.  The new movie.  The chick flick.  Well, she's the new Sandra Bullock.  Right.  She's the new fucking unfunny fucking here she is in a comedy.  How the fuck did she get a comedy?  Right.  We lost Anne.  Like an institutional.  No, I was going to say, I was going to say we lost you. 
[03:04:30]  I think you're already texting to your new girlfriend.  No, I didn't.  I'm not texting.  All right.  No, no.  Continually.  I'm sorry.  I just need to know where that was.  I had to adjust a setting.  There's adjusting a setting.  Louis, there's so many ugly broads here that when one comes by the window like that.  No, that girl was office cute.  She was office cute.  Go out to her in the break room with your heart fluttering. 
[03:05:00]  Is there any way we go out?  And she says, sure.  And you're like, I can't believe it.  Then you get her outside the building and you go, can we go back in the building?  I got work to do.  You fucking pig.  Office cute.  Jesus.  There's the poster you're talking about.  Getting back to the.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  The capturing.  Ha ha.  You fucking assholes.  I've been going off on these.  The ugly truth.  Nothing makes me.  These video covers or posters for months now.  I can't take the stark white background, the, the girl with the, the, oh, and the guy with 
[03:05:30]  the, oh, smug kind of, and there's so many of these, but, but see, the guy has the heart  over his crotch and she has it near her brain because see, we, this is what we're trying  to say is that men, you got to shake your finger at a man.  Yeah.  He's a mess.  Yeah.  Shut up phone.  Say a command.  And then, you know what happens?  I love these movies where it's the girl and the guy and they're thrust together through  some circumstance and, um, boy, they hate each other. 
[03:06:00]  Oh my God.  They can't spend a minute with each other without arguing.  No, like fucking George Clooney and what's her stupid, stupid, stupid face.  Yes.  Yes.  And they're in a cab and they're, oh, I can't stand her.  I can't stand him.  I wonder if they're going to fuck each other in their stupid cunts later.  There's another one.  Gee.  There's another one.  No reservations.  Back to back.  And then their backs are touching and they're looking at each other with a smirk.  That's how they all are. 
[03:06:30]  Don't you just love that?  That's men and women.  Then there's a moment.  You got to live with them and with women.  There's a moment where, where they, uh, it's midway through the movie where it's like,  uh-oh, I think they're going to hook up.  Wait a minute.  Something's going on here.  I think, oh no, monkey wrench thrown in the works.  Oh.  And they were so close to actually getting together, but now they hate each other more than ever,  but they're starting to realize.  There is another one.  Back to back.  Back to back.  White back.  Does Hollywood fucking have any sense of originality? 
[03:07:00]  Or do they just do the same thing over and over and over again?  No, and when you see movies like that, I just see the executives over at their video monitor  during the takes and she's like crossing her eyes and falling down and the executives are  like, she's funny.  She's really funny.  That's funny.  See, not only nerdy, ugly people are funny.  Pretty people are too.  That's like the big code crack is that they desperately want.  Like when you're in high school, either you're a fucking dumb jock that gets to fuck the vacant 
[03:07:30]  cunt blonde or you're the fucking clever kind of gnarly looking, but clever dude who fucking  gets into her pussy through her brain.  Right.  It's one or the other.  But the thing in Hollywood is that they're all, even the executives are good looking people.  The executives are all popular, good looking people and they desperately want to find,  it's like Muslims looking for a blonde guy that'll go on an airplane with a bomb. 
[03:08:00]  They'll never get it.  They'll just never get it.  That's the ideal person.  The most they could get is like, given that Mohammed Adda guy, like a haircut and he's  got this awkward smile, but today he would never get on now.  No, no, no.  But they're trying to get a good looking woman who's fucking funny.  But why would she be?  She didn't have to be.  She didn't have to be.  Anything she said, people would laugh at.  It's not funny.  No, not in the least.  But they would laugh. 
[03:08:30]  Or good.  Same thing with the guys.  He's fucking, you know, George Clooney.  Him and Brad Pitt, when they try to do comedy and they just talk like this and they do  it really fast and they just make little jokes and they're not funny.  Like any of the Oceans movies.  Oh, horrible.  What the fuck is that?  I don't understand.  Here's 11 people who fucking sucks.  That's what those movies are called.  Now here's 12 people who fucking stink.  That should be the title?  Yes.  What was the last good movie you saw, Lou?  By the way, the original Ocean movies were like fucking Don Rickles and Dean Martin and 
[03:09:00]  these weirdos who were fucking funny as hell.  Really funny guys.  Sammy Davis Jr. was not popular in high school.  No.  Got the shit kicked out of him by large white people.  And now, you know, he got his eye literally kicked out.  Yeah, yeah.  Literally.  Then you could have, you know, yeah, like you said, George Clooney and stuff just who never  had to work at it a day in his fucking life.  Pay people to say they're funny.  What was the last good movie you saw?  Or funny movie.  What's going on in Hollywood obviously drives you nuts. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, no, I don't really go.  I don't even give anything a chance anymore.  You don't even try.  I never really go.  Well, I go.  I rent crazies.  I just.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Again, the back to back.  Dude, it's formula.  She's got to hold on.  He's got the smile on like, I'm my own guy.  I'll fuck whatever I want.  And she's holding it by the stove.  That's what you think.  I got you.  Ugh.  Pee you.  Pee fucking you.  Pee fucking capital. 
[03:10:00]  No, I'll tell you.  The best movie I've seen recently was a French movie called The Pianist.  Or The Piano Teacher.  Piano Teacher.  Piano Teacher.  Piano Teacher.  There's this woman.  Doesn't sound very good, Louis.  No, it doesn't sound very good.  From French and the title, I'm going, wow.  All right.  I'm going to ruin it for you so that it's worth talking about.  Yeah.  It's a French movie.  You have to read?  Yes.  The Pianist.  Oh, fuck that reading shit.  It's a French woman and she's a piano teacher at like a high-end academy in Paris. 
[03:10:30]  And you think you're just watching a movie about a woman who's a really tough teacher and  she's very cruel to students that aren't good enough.  That kind of thing.  And she's very weirdly mannered and she has her tea.  You know, one of these just like really strict, unsmiling French woman.  And then you're watching this movie.  It's like 20 minutes.  You're like, well, this is an interesting world I'm getting to learn about.  I don't know.  It's fine.  And then she goes into the mall and she walks around.  You're just watching her walk around the mall.  And then she goes into this video store and you realize it's an adult video store. 
[03:11:00]  And you're like, what's she doing in here?  She's proper.  Why?  She goes into a booth, like a private booth, puts coins in and starts watching like a  ass fuck, black dick, white ass, ass.  And you come around behind her and you see this in the movie.  You see the full on sex.  And then there's a little bin, you know, tissue bin.  She reaches in and gets a cummy tissue and smells it while she watches the porn. 
[03:11:30]  And you're like, what kind of a movie is this?  What kind of a movie is this?  The thing is that it's so beautifully shot.  You're like, this is just a nice artsy film.  This is an artsy movie about artists.  With the glow on the cum tissue.  Yeah, with a lot of piano, you know.  And then all of a sudden she's smelling a tissue while she's watching a guy fuck a girl in  the ass.  And she's got the same bitchy look on her face as when she's like with a metronome.  That is amazing.  And then she, some young pianist guy who she hates because she thinks he's a hack. 
[03:12:00]  Like he plays very flowery and everybody thinks he's great.  But she's got it.  She's hot for him.  And so she sees him being nice to a young girl pianist.  So then you, so you just see that you see her observing him being nice to this young  girl pianist who's about to do a recital, a student of hers.  And then you see her in the cloak room.  You don't know why you're watching this.  The whole movie is like this.  Like, why am I watching her walk around a cloak room?  She finds a coat that she was looking for and then she gets a glass out of the bar and 
[03:12:30]  she crushes it like, you know, like at a wedding, a Jewish wedding, puts it in a napkin and  crushes it and puts crushed glass in the girl's coat pockets.  Then the girl puts her hands and just her fingers are destroyed and she can't do the piano recital.  This woman is this psychotic, horny, crazy bitch.  People saying the movie was brilliant, but very slow.  I guess that would be the walking around part.  Yeah.  If you're a fucking American retard that watches Mel Gibson movies, it's slow.  If you have, if you fucking take a breath and stop watching Hulk Hogan's fucking show, 
[03:13:00]  you might enjoy life.  Something different, right?  No, because I knew, I knew that right when Louis said like, so I'm like, this is nice.  I'm getting to know this world.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, you can't just learn that in a two second clip.  It takes a while.  I go to the artsy theater, so I totally get that.  You're like, all right, I'm learning about something I would have never learned about.  And then she's smelling a cum rag.  Yeah, well, then it gets to something you know all about.  Fantastic.  It's sick.  It's a sick, sick, twisted movie. 
[03:13:30]  Now I want to see the movie.  It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, honestly.  Wow.  And I see a lot of movies.  Yeah.  I'm going to go fucking see that today.  That makes my, like, my favorite movies.  What's your favorite movie?  Like, I feel like an asshole for them being my favorite movies.  Police Academy 3?  It's not that.  No, 2 was good.  But, ugh.  No, I like, well, Sling Blade, I always thought was really, really good.  I thought Billy Bob Thornton was really good.  What about a recent movie, though?  And then, recently, I really liked The Prestige. 
[03:14:00]  I liked that movie.  Fuck, I still haven't seen that goddamn movie.  That was pretty good.  Yeah, yeah.  That was pretty good.  That was a weird little twist there in the whole thing.  And Christian Bale was good in that one.  Christian Bale's good.  Yeah, yeah.  So, those I liked.  Yeah, there's no real, you know, stupid.  Astronaut Farmer was fucking good.  Oh, horrible.  That was great.  And I look at something like Sling Blade, written, directed, produced, everything by Billy Bob Thornton.  Mm-hmm.  And you go, this guy was one more of those away from being brilliant. 
[03:14:30]  Yep.  Like, one more.  If he had one more Sling Blade in him.  Even a half a Sling Blade.  He was going to be Billy Bob Thornton fucking, you know, the amazing director, writer, actor.  And then he goes and does, you know, Armageddon and fucking Astronaut Farmer.  Continued all the way to Mr. Woodcock.  Mr. Woodcock and stuff.  And you're like, what the fuck happened to Carl?  And that great dialogue and fucking, it was amazing. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  I agree.  Doyle.  Doyle.  What do you think?  Doyle Hargrave was great in that.  Like, just that.  And then you think, like, okay, Doyle in that movie, in Sling Blade, he wrote that, yeah.  He fucking, like, like, Billy Bob, you don't think he wrote his lines, too, and wrote the  kids' fucking lines and the mother's lines.  It's like, how the fuck you do that?  Because they were such great characters, all of them.  And then, you know, Mr. Woodcock and fucking.  Well, Sylvester Stallone made Rocky. 
[03:15:30]  He wrote Rocky, which is one of the greatest movies ever, ever made.  Yeah.  And then he proceeded to just shit in the mouth of America for the next 30 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the office of Cobretty.  Call him Cobra.  Oh, fuck Tango and Cash.  Yeah.  Was he in Tango and Cash?  No, that's, isn't that a million show movies?  A million show movies.  No, no, that was a.  Tango and Cash.  No, that was.  Yeah, it was.  Stallone.  Stallone.  And Kurt Russell.  And Kurt Russell.  That's right.  No, you were thinking along with the dog. 
[03:16:00]  You're thinking of Turner and Hooch.  Turner and Hooch.  Turner and Hooch.  Tango and Cash.  That was Tom Hanks.  That's good.  You know, you got him confused.  Yeah, it's weird you got confused there.  I don't know why.  I don't know.  It came out like the same year.  I think like three months apart or something.  Hey, changing gears.  What do you think of Obama having the beer sit down?  We're going to all be talking about this tonight on TV.  Yeah, I think that was kind of a mess that he got into by saying anything about a local thing.  I mean, hey, that cop was so intelligent. 
[03:16:30]  I mean, that's what fucked him over.  It really did.  If the cop hadn't said anything, it would have just gone away.  But that cop just said, hey, and even said, I support the president.  I support the president.  He goes, hey.  It's a local thing and you shouldn't get, you don't know everything that happened.  And every time something, it just shows, every time something happens when nobody was there,  just a private moment between two people, then everyone's wrong.  Absolutely everyone's wrong.  No one should say a fucking thing.  How do you preface it?  You don't know you weren't there.  And then nobody knows what the woman really said. 
[03:17:00]  Everything gets distorted because people bring their own thing.  So when you start with something and then you become the president saying something.  Well, the president should know better.  As definitive as that was stupid.  You should know better.  But it's because, see, then nobody knows what it's like to be Barack Obama and Louis Gates Jr.  If you're black, here's the thing with Louis Gates Jr.  The thing that white people have to keep in mind, because we have different timelines in our heads.  Like white people often say, I've heard so many white people say, slavery was 400 years ago. 
[03:17:30]  It was 130 years ago.  It was really, people say that, hey, that was, well, we started 400 years ago.  Slavery began.  We kind of mopped up.  We got a couple centuries in.  No one hit the lights until about 130 years ago is when it really stopped.  And also it didn't stop.  And then things have been just awesome for black people since that. 
[03:18:00]  Like that's the last bad thing to happen to any black person was slavery 400 years ago.  That's what we think.  And since then, we've just been showering them with gifts since then.  It was a, it ended officially 130 years ago, really continued for another 80 and then give  or take the thing to remember is that if a black guy has, or a black woman has a little  gray hair at the temples, they lived in an America where they were legally barred from 
[03:18:30]  using certain fucking bathrooms where the, where the country didn't let them use the fucking  bathroom.  Keep your big black smelly cock out of this room, you fucking black bastard.  Like that was the official American law was you can't pee anywhere you want, fucking coon.  That's what it was like.  And so you take that.  So anybody that age remembers that and has had to live and go, okay, thank you for now letting 
[03:19:00]  me do what I should have always been able to do.  Or you were raised by somebody.  If anybody younger, a young, a black person in their thirties or younger was raised by  somebody who lived in an America like that.  Right.  So how do you fucking Lewis Gates jr.  He's the president of fucking Harvard and he sees a cop looking at him twice.  He's like, what do I got to do?  What the fuck do I got to do?  So you're, if you're the president of Barack Obama, you got Lewis Gates jr. 
[03:19:30]  Calling you on the phone and telling you and just screaming at you.  And you're like, oh boy, that's guys.  Brock's age are raised again.  They're their parents.  So for better or worse one though, the white one or the black one?  Well, I mean, every black person is brought, I mean, imagine how, what Brock gets from black  people, all of them.  Okay.  Now that you're in there, you got it.  You're going to apologize for, you know, you know, take down the Washington monument. 
[03:20:00]  He's like, look, I can't take down the Washington.  Listen, I can't take it down.  Paint the white house black.  I can't.  Look, small moves.  You're going to fuck you.  I told you, if you get in there, you're painting the white house.  Yes, I did.  Look, you know, when he got the call from Lewis Gates jr.  He's rubbed his temples and went, oh God, I got to say, I got to say something coming  up here.  I got to say something.  I got to say, say something.  And then he preface it by saying I wasn't there, but, but now let me talk like I was 
[03:20:30]  and get into all kinds of trouble.  Exactly.  So I think he made a mistake by saying something, but it's, it's an understandable mistake on  some level.  It turns out the cop, those.  Was that soccer Patty on Maury just now?  Yeah.  Are they still running that?  Yeah.  That thing is like, again, that thing has been probably 10 times.  She talks about how she, God bless you.  All right.  Anyway, back to the president.  But what a great angle that I haven't heard from anyone yet about Obama and the shit he 
[03:21:00]  has to hear from people.  What he hears from the, from older black generation.  That we never get to hear.  No, we have no idea what kind of pressure he is.  But you got to imagine those phone calls are pretty fucking brutal.  Like, you got to say something.  Yeah.  You got to do this for all of us.  Yeah.  I can't.  No, and part of having a black president now, it is a major difference is that you're going  to hear a perspective you're not used to hearing.  That's all.  And it's not always going to be right.  It's going to be flawed from a black perspective, but it's just where we have never, we've never  been in a situation. 
[03:21:30]  Here's the only, I can wrap it up with, with, with, with people that believe I am.  People believe I'm just a horrific racist.  I don't think you are.  Thank you, Luke.  I'm not that horrific.  I think you're a delightful racist.  I'm very good.  Now, here's the thing.  I cannot stand the disproportionate amount of crime and violence in the black community  amongst black, young black men.  The disproportionate amount of violence, sheer, brutal fucking violence.  And I'm not even talking just against, you know, white folk. 
[03:22:00]  Black on black is amazing.  It is amazing.  The willingness and, and quickness at which they will kill each other over nothing.  And that, to me, separates, it's too separate.  I can't relate to it.  I don't know other people that can relate to it.  Did you ever live in a black, did you ever live in like a black neighborhood?  I've, yes, I lived in Central Islip.  I lived on Hawthorne Avenue, if you know where that is.  But were you in like a white enclave or were you in a black neighborhood? 
[03:22:30]  Nope.  I was in a black neighborhood with a few white kids that were petrified for their lives  on a daily basis going to school.  There was this kid, I can't, Keith Green, his name was, and he'd come up to me and go,  give me 50 cent.  Give me 50 cent.  Every day.  And, and, and I'd have to give him 50 cent.  Or it was like, wham, you're getting whacked.  You have to give him 50 cent.  And it had to be 50.  It literally wasn't 50. 
[03:23:00]  It was 50.  Yeah.  And Danny puts a picture of 50 up.  It's funny.  There's a 50.  There's going to be a 50 cent piece at some point.  Give me 50 cent.  And he'd look down at me like, like, give me 50 cent.  Like, and I'd be petrified.  Sure.  I was so scared.  That's all he wanted was 50 cent.  Just 50 cent.  You're like, I got a dollar.  He's like, no, no, no, no.  50.  It's the 70s though, dude.  So 50 cent was.  With inflation.  That's huge.  It was probably $10.  That was everything.  That was lunch.  That was, you know, hanging out candy after school.  You know, everything.  All that for 50 cent was huge. 
[03:23:30]  All that for 50 cent?  Back in the day.  God damn.  Back in the day.  But like, so, and I don't like the excuse of.  Coconut Snickers.  That whole thing.  Like, like the, the whole.  All right.  You were brought up in a black neighborhood.  It's impoverished.  It's this.  It's that.  You know.  Well, I don't think it's that simple.  I think.  Well, I mean, I lived in Roxbury for a while in Massachusetts.  Yes.  In a pleasant area.  Very nice.  On the Parker Street.  I lived on Parker Street next door to the Parker Street projects.  Wow.  My car was stolen while I was fucking a girl.  Like, I was literally, I was fucking a girl in my apartment, and I heard glass, like that 
[03:24:00]  sound of car glass breaking, that safety glass, like outside the window, and I'm like, fucking,  uh, okay, that's right outside the window.  That's my car.  And then I hear the car starting.  I'm like, that's my fucking car.  Oh, jeez.  And I literally, I run out on the street and watch the car.  I'm looking at the taillights of my car.  Yeah.  And someone else is in it.  And I go back and I call 911.  Somebody stole my car.  I can still hear it going down the Parker Street Hill. 
[03:24:30]  And the guy goes, you got to come in and fill out a report.  And I go, well, no, fucking send somebody here.  Right.  Chase him.  No, you have to come down to the precinct and fill out paperwork.  And it's because I lived on the Parker Street projects, cops would not come there.  They wouldn't come there.  Why would they?  They wouldn't come there.  They'd go, they spent, when I grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, there's fucking cops circling  our house, like the president is having dinner there.  Wonderful.  Constant police surveillance.  Isn't that great?  Of rich neighborhoods. 
[03:25:00]  No.  And, and Parker Street, my neighbors were lovely people who lived behind bars.  It's like Ross Perot said in one of the debates, these people live in a, they put themselves  in prison in order to protect themselves.  Because cops won't go to these places and the city won't, won't fucking clean the streets.  Why would a cop go to that area?  Because they don't give a shit about those people.  Yeah.  Because it's not so much that they don't give a shit about those people.  They fuck themselves by going in those neighborhoods.  Cops put their lives and their careers.  It's not the specific police. 
[03:25:30]  It's what, it's what resources are allocated to what places.  And rich neighborhoods get more resources allocated to them than poor neighborhoods.  And because that's where the tax bases are.  The tax is also paying for that protection.  It's really poor on poor violence and black people have a, have a poor look to them because  a lot of them are poor and they have been historically.  So it's, it is a cycle.  I think though.  I think it's a cycle.  So there's nobody that can, if you neglect a neighborhood, everybody will, people, people  rob and kill their neighbors. 
[03:26:00]  That's what people do.  They don't go to other areas.  Oh no, no.  I realize very rarely it does happen, but yeah, but I'm saying yes.  That's why I was saying black on black crime is amazing.  I watch, when you watch, uh, you ever watch first 48 where they got to take the first  48 hours of a murder and investigate it.  And in the end, it is always on this show, not only like cops where, you know, you get  to see some white trailers, park trash, beating each other's senseless.  Uh, this is all black guys killing other black guys. 
[03:26:30]  Right.  The victims black, the witnesses are black, the purpose black.  Why do you care about black on black crime though?  I know I'm saying that that is what put makes this divide.  Like I can't, I've been fucking poor.  I lived in my car.  I, I've been impoverished for many years.  I wasn't able to afford food.  I dug change out of like couch cushions.  I lived on friends' couches until they, your friend's couch and you dig the change out.  Yeah.  I dig the change out to try to buy like Hydrox cookies. 
[03:27:00]  I couldn't even get Oreos.  Yeah.  Just to that.  So I've been like in that situation, but I understand I'm not black.  I have lived, uh, the whole legacy of that.  No, no, but I don't think it's just, I just don't think it's that simple.  I have no idea of that lifestyle where life is so fucking worthless and, and, and violence  is so prevalent where the, just the want for violence.  Like if I got in a fight with somebody and I punched them and they fell down, I would 
[03:27:30]  not then stomp their head until they're dead or in a coma in the hospital or some shit like  that.  I, I, but that seems to be what's going on.  Well, let me just make, can I just make a distinction though?  Please.  Because as far as where this conversation came from, yeah, Louis Gates Jr. being arrested  and getting cranky about it and the, and that coming from his personal history being a painful  one in America, understandably and rising above it, by the way, and become not, he's not, 
[03:28:00]  he didn't respond to it by being a black on black violent or no, he responded to it by elevating  himself and running the greatest black studies, the greatest universe, which, which by the  way is revisionist history a lot of times.  And it's a, and he's the president of Harvard ingrained, um, he did, he looked, he trust  of white people, if not a genuine dislike of white people.  Well, sure.  Again, again, again, that 50 cent really, uh, yeah, and by the way, this is interesting 
[03:28:30]  because then here's this other one is you're definitely colored, so to speak by the fellow  who asked you for 50 cent.  That was a fear that was put into you that you'll never forget.  And I totally, and I, I respect and understand that that's going to mean that you're going  to see these, all these stories differently.  When you hear about, when you see, uh, Barack Obama saying they acted stupidly, it just is 
[03:29:00]  a beeline in a synopsis firing path in your brain that goes right to that guy asking you  for 50 cent any time.  And that's going to, that's, that's deeply ingrained in you and that's understandable.  But if 50 cent was the last time I ever saw anything bad.  When Louis Gates Jr.  sees a cop with his hand on, on the gun, on the butt of the gun saying, uh, sir, I need  you to step away from your own fucking house.  He just remembers, he remembers whites only fucking signs and all that stuff. 
[03:29:30]  And it drives him crazy.  And so that's just, everybody brings their own thing to it.  I think, I mean, that's, I, I, I personally think that America is working remarkably well  considering all that.  It's considering all the wreckage of the history.  It actually works pretty well.  There is no, the fact that look, the people in fucking Iowa voted for Barack Obama.  That means, you know, we're, whether or not he ends up being a great president, I think  we're, we're, it's, we're coming out on top of this shit, but it's complicated. 
[03:30:00]  We're just a messy family.  Just the other day, let me, let me, I, I disagree.  My father, my father came and stayed with me for, for a week.  Well, two days, it felt like a week, it was two days.  And, uh, my dad, I have such a fucked up history with my dad.  Um, but I got through it.  I got through these two days.  I was like, Hey, you know what?  We made it.  We can do this.  Like he's 72 now.  I don't know how long he's got left.  I'm not sure, you know, what, how he's making it.  You know, he's had a tough life.  Yeah.  And, uh, and so I got through the two days, but there were moments during those two days 
[03:30:30]  where he just did certain, had said little things that I was, I almost fucking hit him  in the face.  I almost, I almost had to call 911 and go, hi, listen, I just killed my dad and I need  someone to come over here.  Just take care of my kids for me.  You know, I like his take on that whole, but I like it.  It's different.  And I'm not saying that there's an, here's the thing.  I say it's understandable that certain older black people have an edge on them because of 
[03:31:00]  history.  But, and then you take it to, uh, that it's an excuse for black, for, for violence and  murder.  Well, but it's not, but I'm not thinking of that.  And I, and I do, but, but you're, and again, it's just really fascinating that that's your  perspective because of what's going on with you in your life.  It's not just my perspective on that.  It, it, it, it's kind of simplistic because I gave you one example of, of something that  happened and then the only one that matters, but it is the only one is the one that went 
[03:31:30]  right.  If that first moment with a black man, if that was the only knowledge I'd had of that, uh,  it would have been a forgotten memory, but it's reinforced constantly by just this, this  unbelievable, you know, like when you buy landish, uh, unbalance in violent crime, although  perpetrating it, all of it has been informed by the first experience you had.  And I'm not saying this is a flaw.  This is how everybody is.  So I'm watching, uh, uh, a black man collecting, pummeling, uh, an old white woman for her money 
[03:32:00]  on, on a video surveillance camera.  And it's because of 50 cent that I look at that.  I should look at him like a gentleman.  No.  And of course, of course not.  What does 50 cent have to do with the way I interpret that?  You started a collect, you started a collection that began with 50 cent.  But I can't, I'm not collecting.  I'm being given this.  Right.  People are, are throwing this at me as I see from, from, uh, uh, surveillance videos.  You're, you're, you're, you're being thrown a lot.  You're being thrown.  By the way, Louis Gates Jr. 
[03:32:30]  I think from, from what I know, and I was there, I'm just going to keep adding to the  mess.  You were there.  I'm just going to keep adding to the fucking mess.  I was there.  I am Louis Gates Jr.  I knew it.  And when I saw that cop, no, he acted wrongly.  No matter what.  Look, I got pulled over by a cop recently and I was with my kids.  This cop was a dick.  Okay.  And he was a young man.  That's the thing.  The other thing that's like every, everything in your life adds to what's happening in your  moment.  The cop in that, in this story was a young man. 
[03:33:00]  When you get older and you get pulled over by a 22 year old who's likes having a gun,  it just bothers you.  It just bothers you.  The person's like, it shouldn't.  No, it should.  It shouldn't.  No, it shouldn't.  It is absolutely right.  It bothers all of us though.  That's the point I'm being.  But when I got pulled over by this cop recently, I had my kids in the car and he doesn't, I  know he doesn't have kids and I don't think, you know, there's certain people where they  have a kid radar.  Like they just have a sense of there's kids here.  Yeah.  That changes how you act.  And some people are like, no, they don't.  They, and then later they'll have kids and look back and go, oh geez, I, duh, you know. 
[03:33:30]  She have identification on her?  Yeah, exactly.  He comes up to my fucking car, two cops.  I passed a guy.  A guy was drifting into the left turn lane close to an intersection.  You don't have to make it sound good for me.  So I assume that he's going to make a left.  So I moved to the right of him, pass him on the right.  And then he changes his mind and goes into a gas station on the right.  So I get pulled over by two state troopers.  Like they needed two fucking cars and they come to each side and they both have their fucking 
[03:34:00]  hands.  You know, there's the hand on the gun thing is important, but some guys do it.  You know, it's civilly.  And some guys, these guys looked fucking hostile and my kids look scared.  Daytime or nighttime?  Daytime.  Okay.  Middle of the day.  Fucking morning.  Night in the morning.  Could they see you?  Yeah.  I'm very white.  I'm driving an infinity and it doesn't have spinning rims.  There's no loud music.  So your kids are scared.  I'm a balding white man.  Excuse me.  And my kids are like, but daddy, you're white. 
[03:34:30]  So the cop comes over and he goes, you know, you know, you know what you did.  And I go, well, I'm not sure.  Honestly, you pass somebody on the right.  And I go, oh, well, I thought he was going like he did that.  He had his blinker on and I go, you know what, sir?  I didn't see the blinker, but I assume you're probably right.  I probably just had exercise in bad judgment.  Like, I'm just trying to get to the fucking ticket.  Right.  Get to the point.  What's with that inspection sticker? 
[03:35:00]  How come the hole isn't punched?  I don't know.  I didn't.  I went to a gas station and got it.  Yeah.  You're supposed to have the hole punched.  I go, I'm.  Was I supposed to punch it?  My actual.  It's just he's.  Yeah.  And he goes, he reaches in the and rips my.  He goes, this is coming with me and rips my inspection.  Are you shitting me?  Which is putting me now.  And like, I got to drive around without a sticker till I get one.  That guy's a fucking asshole.  He's he's being an asshole.  Right.  But I still recognize that my role is respect the law. 
[03:35:30]  Get past the get the paperwork from him.  Yes, sir.  Get the paperwork.  And it looks like you got a headlight out, boy.  Exactly.  Well, I guess I shouldn't have had the headlight out, officer.  I'm collecting information.  I'm getting my paperwork.  I'm going to go to court and I'm going to fight it.  And I won't pay for these tickets.  Yeah, absolutely.  But I'm driving around.  Meanwhile, I got to.  Worry about getting pulled over all the time because nobody has inspection stations upstate  because the economy is shit and nobody. 
[03:36:00]  You go to a gas station.  We don't do inspections.  You ripped off your inspections.  Rift it off.  What a prick.  Didn't wait for me to explain anything to him or whatever.  Just fucking.  That's just a cock.  But still, my role is to act respectful to police.  So I think that Lewis Gates acted, it's wrong to just start yelling.  You just don't get to do that.  Even if you are in your own house, even if you're being arrested for doing nothing, even  if you're being totally.  No, he was right.  It's not fair. 
[03:36:30]  But no.  No.  But I understand it.  That's all I understand.  I empathize with the moment.  He was being extremely belligerent to an officer who was, from what they say, and from certain  radio transmissions, that was being as polite as possible to this gentleman, answering a  call to a burglary in progress, he gets there, and then he's accused of being a racist, and  then the professor starts talking about his mama and shit like that.  Yeah, but here's the other thing, too, though. 
[03:37:00]  It's like there's so many parts of this that are like part of the, this is such a, I think  these kinds of things are always good.  I think this is a positive thing, because it's a conversation the whole country has,  and talking about this kind of thing is pure positive.  I think it's all good.  I was going to say this before.  I don't think it is, because I think it shows just how close to the surface all this shit  is bubbling.  Of course it is.  And how it's just this fine veneer of spackle that is over a little crap.  Yeah, but talking is better than, yeah, but it can't hurt to talk about it.  Talking is better than bubbling, and I think that it's important for people to know what 
[03:37:30]  it's like to be a guy like Louis Gates, and what it's like to be like this cop, and go  into the morass of racism every time you answer any kind of a call.  It must be very frustrating.  But I always also think about Americans, fucking entitled, rich, white, gun-owning Americans  who just, this castle, fucking house is your-  Castle?  Yes.  You're explaining-  Yes.  You are completely describing my mind.  Yes.  Your house is your castle.  That's right.  Anyone walks in, steps on the lawn, you can shoot them in the fucking mouth.  Exactly.  Ka-blam-o.  So in that context, a guy coming into your house and saying anything untoward, you're like, 
[03:38:00]  fuck you, you fucking racist, fucking faggot cop.  Fuck your mother in the ass, you little faggot racist.  Get off my fucking property.  I'm the president of Harvard, you fucking little Irish, South Boston prick.  Go shove it in your mother's cunt.  I don't care if you fucking brought that basketball player back to life.  Fuck you.  I'm fucking Louis Gates.  I'm calling Barack right now.  He's on my fucking speed dial, you motherfucker. 
[03:38:30]  I get it.  I get that.  Yeah?  I think if you were black, that's what you would say to a cop if he came on your property,  or you'd just shoot him.  No, I would be very cordial.  I would be the pull myself up by my bootstraps kind of a guy.  That's right.  But that's what he was.  He's like, I pulled myself up by my bootstraps and I still get fucking arrested for having  a jammed door.  It's, from Louis Gates Jr.'s point of view, it's a complete outrage. 
[03:39:00]  I get it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's up?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I think I'm being chastised.  I don't know who it is.  Who's that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm being chastised.  Wait, is that Snoop?  That's Snoop.  I don't know.  What's up?  From the wire.  What's up?  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah, it is.  Snoop, what's up?  I know Snoop.  Yeah, from the wire.  From the wire.  Is that kid in the wire, really? 
[03:39:30]  It might be a girl.  Yeah.  Man, big fan, man.  Snoop.  How's it going, man?  Louis C.K.  How are you?  What's up?  How's it going?  I don't know your real name.  I know you.  Snoop.  Snoop.  How you feeling?  Sit down.  It was scared.  I thought you were doing gang signs or something.  He got all scared.  What's up?  Oh, yeah.  Can you hear us?  Because we're having a race conversation.  So it's just funny that we walked over there.  We were talking about Barack fucking professor.  Gates, Louis Gates Jr.  I was trying to describe to him what Louis Gates Jr. felt like. 
[03:40:00]  And of course, Louis is the guy to describe to me.  Look at me.  I know.  What an older guy feels like when the cops come to his house.  I have walked the Louis Gates Jr. walk.  I know just what it's like.  No, I don't know.  Your hair looks good, by the way.  Thanks, buddy.  I say that because in the wire, how's my hair look?  Yeah.  It looks like you played one of the greatest characters ever on the wire, Snoop.  Yeah, man.  Holy shit.  You were a scary motherfucker on that show.  Holy shit. 
[03:40:30]  It was TV.  It was the scripts, man.  I had to do what I was paid for, man.  Jimmy's going to be so bummed he's not here today.  Jimmy's going to be so good.  It's good.  It's like his favorite show, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Jimmy's filming a movie in Boston, but he'll be back tomorrow.  Music.  I just had an interview over there.  Music.  Television.  Reality show ready to come up.  Which one?  What are you doing?  I'm just trying to help kids get on the right track, you know, just like T.I.  Road to Redemption.  You know, I'm going to switch it up in my own flavor. 
[03:41:00]  So going all over the world, just helping kids, you know, out the ghetto.  Go ahead.  Where are you from, man?  What's that accent?  Where are you from?  Baltimore.  Wow, man.  It's different than Sal.  My stepfather's accent.  Now, Baltimore is the South.  Baltimore is the South.  It's the start of the South.  Yeah, it's just where it starts.  South sure don't sound like that.  You were discovered on the streets, right?  Yeah, in a nightclub.  Michael K. Williams played a character, Omar. 
[03:41:30]  Sure.  And he told me, come on through.  I came on through.  And here I am.  Making a long story short.  Just like that.  His whole life changed.  Because Omar was in the same place.  Yeah, that was God, though, man.  Sure enough.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  I was on the road to Woo.  The road to Woo.  The road to Woo.  Woo is just south of Baltimore, I think.  The road to Woo.  Yeah, you were in the game and shit?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, that was my past life. 
[03:42:00]  You know, selling drugs.  Trying to make a life for myself, you know?  And just put money in my pocket.  You know, I tried to do the right thing.  You know, I was incarcerated.  Tried to do the right thing when I came home.  Six and a half years.  Holy shit.  So you went to jail and you tried to change when you came home, you're saying?  And they just downplayed me, man.  You know what I mean?  It was just crazy.  They just fired me.  Every three, I mean, all three jobs.  They whated you?  They fired me.  Oh, fired you.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  I had three jobs.  They fired me.  I said, man, fuck this, man.  I'm going on the block.  I'm going to get it in, man.  And you went back to crime?  Hustling, yeah.  God, look at that, man.  How old were you then?  What, when I came home?  Yeah, when you came home, how old were you?  21.  And then you had three jobs.  Yeah.  Went back.  And how long were those three jobs?  I was working for Ford and all.  Like, making Ford bumpers.  You know what I mean?  Making $16 an hour.  Yeah, I was just coming home.  I was living the life.  What did they fire you for?  Because of my background, my criminal background. 
[03:43:00]  You know?  Oh, they found out or some shit?  Yeah, but I said it on my job, on my application.  Like, I mean, you know how they got the question, have you ever been incarcerated?  I put, yes, explain, and interview.  You know what I mean?  And they still hired me.  But two weeks later, they fired me.  I said, damn, at least I got one paycheck.  What were the other, you worked for Ford?  What were the other two jobs?  What, the book company and stacking boxes. 
[03:43:30]  God damn, man.  Yeah.  When did you get the tats?  In prison?  No, no, I waited till I came home.  I wanted to try and catch nothing.  They look too good to be a prison tats.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good thing you steered clear of those things.  A rusty needle.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  Those things always look like shit.  Who is that?  Who's Arnold?  That's my uncle, man.  Your uncle?  Yeah, he passed away while I was locked up.  You know, that was like, you know, when you think, well, you don't know. 
[03:44:00]  Y'all don't know.  No.  When you're incarcerated, you know, all your friends and like half of your family just,  you know, disappear on you.  And there's the man that.  He stayed with you?  Yeah, exactly.  You know, visits, phone calls, money, all this, all that.  You know, so he wouldn't meet you my dying day, you know?  Yeah, it must have meant a lot.  Yeah, it did.  Obviously.  Gonna get a tad.  Yeah, he's a guy I kind of knew once.  I got a tattoo of a guy.  He came, you know.  I talk about that in Grace After Midnight.  I got a book out called Grace After Midnight. 
[03:44:30]  It's in Barnes and Nobles, Amazon.com.  It's in reprint right now, you know what I mean?  Right on.  And I'm writing my second one.  And some kid is stacking that book in a box somewhere.  In Baltimore.  Where you used to work.  God damn, we don't even have any time left right now.  Yeah, I just have you back, man.  I just ran in and said hello, man.  Snoop, keep going, man.  You got to come back when Jimmy's here.  Yeah, Jimmy will shit his pants.  Oh, my God.  He will.  Loves the wire, man. 
[03:45:00]  Put them all black and run down on them, man.  All right, I'll see y'all later, man.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks, Snoop.  Okay, man.  Very cool.  Cheers.  It's Jimmy's.  I got you.  Oh, my God.  I saw this yesterday for Jim, man.  Oh, you already signed one for Jimmy?  I didn't know.  No, I'm going to sign it again for him.  Sign it again.  You never know.  Because I did case late last night.  Jimmy would be like, I'll take two.  Winking, blinking.  What a psychopath he is.  That's cool, man.  I'm like, what the fuck? 
[03:45:30]  Well, you got scared because she was giving you all sorts of signs outside the window.  All right, man.  What's up, man?  I'll be there.  See you all later.  See you, man.  Nice to meet you.  Take it easy.  It was a good show, you guys, today.  Yeah.  Louie, you fucking...  I love listening to Louie CK.  He's got a way of looking at things.  Oh, yeah.  Did I say he?  Who said he?  Who said he?  All of us said he?  Was I the only one?  I know it's not a he.  I said man and dude. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  But I didn't mean, like, man or dude.  That's a man.  No, that's a shit.  I knew that, too, but I think I might have slipped, too.  That's a girl.  Okay.  She was a nice girl.  Yeah.  She was a nice guy.  Officially, who said he instead of she?  I think I got one out.  Huh?  Louie did, too.  What did I say?  You said he.  To him?  Yeah.  To that?  To that?  God damn. 
[03:46:30]  No, I was just saying, dude.  How did I say he?  You said he.  Louie said he.  And I was right there, too.  Oh.  Hey, you said he.  That's why at the end I said, she was giving dang signs to Anthony.  Holy shit.  We are assholes.  Wait, so she got out of jail at 21.  21, went, had three jobs.  Wait, wait, wait.  But before that, she was in for six and a half years, so she went in at 14?  Young.  14 and a half?  Young.  Damn.  What'd she do?  From what I was told.  She was convicted of attempted murder. 
[03:47:00]  Holy shit.  At 14.  At 14.  It's just attempted.  I can't believe Anthony called her a him.  I did not.  I was just saying, yeah, man.  All right.  Yeah, dude.  Wow.  I called girls, dude.  Yeah, just like that intern when she was leaving, right?  No.  See you later, dude.  No.  Okay.  I didn't.  You're right, Danny.  Wow.  Strange.  Yeah.  That was funny timing.  The whole, that whole.  It certainly was.  After the whole conversation we had.  Let's meet a black-on-black violent. 
[03:47:30]  Let's meet one now.  Let's meet one now.  A questionable sexuality.  You ever ask anybody for 50 cents in a not-so-nice way?  Probably.  Probably.  Probably will.  Attempt a murder.  Interesting.  Attempt a murder.  Right there, Louie.  This is why, like, Vietnam vets that were in prison meet their torturers, and everybody  cries.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why you tore, I didn't know you had a, oh, now I get it.  I see. 
[03:48:00]  Your mom wasn't nice to you.  Well, it's fine then.  Three jobs, and you were fired.  You tried to go straight, and that's why you're slinging a rock back on the street again.  And then her manager at Ford would be like, that's not what fucking happened.  Fuck her.  Let me tell you.  I gave her a shot.  Why do you think I hired her?  The fuck?  We fucking, we never lost so many bumpers in a week in my life.  Hey, fucking bumper, bumpers over each shoulder.  God knows.  Fuck.  You won't buy a bumper?  Yeah.  I'll sell you a bumper. 
[03:48:30]  She'll come back.  Yeah.  You didn't see the wire, really.  No, I'm not up to that point.  I never saw it.  Oh, my God.  Not up to that point.  Fucking intimidate.  She, wow.  Barely acting, though, because they got her right off the streets of Baltimore.  Yeah.  Every, you know, that's the thing.  It's like, every time, when you boil the crazy fucked up America down to the individual,  it just changes how you look at it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Every person has their different weird story.  It's never, it's never simple.  Like, when we did the virus tour, remember when Carlos was on the show? 
[03:49:00]  We had Carlos on, and there was all this anticipation of Carlos being on the show because  of Carlos being, you know, the fucking notorious thief and Rogan and all that shit that happened.  Oh, right, yeah, yeah.  Right.  And so, Carlos was coming on the tour, and I remember on, I was looking on the whack bag  on your, your, your group, and they're all saying, let's all, there was all these planned  protests, like, let's not, can we, they were actually, somebody was trying to see if  they could organize just every, the entire stadium just walking out silently.  Let me organize an entire stadium.  And so, so what was going to happen? 
[03:49:30]  So, and, and, and you're, you're trying, God bless them for trying.  Yeah, exactly.  And then somebody has a picture, and I think it was Lindsay, your, your, your, at the time  fiance, I don't know if you guys are, you're married now, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, she had this picture of all the comedians at the curtain, like little boys at Christmas  trying to peek.  Every comedian, I'm trying to look through the curtain while, while Carlos is on stage.  Wow, that's, yeah, it's a great, it's a great shot.  Yeah, and Carlos, nobody knew what was going to happen, and he went on, the first show was  Detroit. 
[03:50:00]  I remember all this very clearly, and he went, Detroit went on to a rain of, a light shower  of booze, and he just fucking murdered, killed, not only stamped out the booze, but did  then another 40 minutes, and just destroyed, same thing in New Jersey, but he fucking destroyed,  but so Carlos and I flew together to LA after the show, and we just happened to sit right  next to each other, and I don't know Carlos that well, but I know him, and so I asked him  very directly about all that shit, about all the stealing and stuff, and he, and I talked 
[03:50:30]  for a whole flight about it, and it, you know, I now have a very complicated view, I'm not  sure what the fuck happened, and it's very, it's not that he like weaseled his way, it's  just that his view of it is complicated, it's a, he has a narrative, he has a story about  what happened with all that stealing stuff, and with Rogan, and with Cosby, and with  everybody, and it's just really interesting, and it's filthy, and it's complicated, and  it's not so easy to point, if you just listen to a person, I look at the big picture, yeah, 
[03:51:00]  you can't point at a person and go, you're just a fucking dirty thief, fucking Joe Rogan's  awesome, you're a piece of shit, fuck Dane Cook, you're up, blah, blah, blah, it's just  too easy, if you meet a person, talk for five minutes, you go, oh geez, I can't really  say this anymore, I gotta accent that story too, because he was feeling that energy that  the crowd was giving him, and everyone going, oh my god, Carlos is on this tour, and we just  went, like you said, went to the Rogan thing and all that, when he finished that set, it  was a relief of energy, he threw that, I think he does do the microphone throwing it down thing, 
[03:51:30]  yeah, he does the thing where he jacks off the mic and spits over the top, so it looks  like it's coming, and then he throws it on the floor, and it was beautiful, but it was, there  was a little more, there was a little more to it, oh yeah, he really, like, said, well  there you go, motherfuckers, yeah, exactly, and as a comedian, I was so impressed, we all  were, that he overcame that, and just by being fucking good, and on the flight home, I said  that, what was that like, that was ballsy, and he goes, I was terrified, and to learn,  to find out, that he was really scared, it wasn't because he was like, fuck everybody, he

[03:56:00]  these guys can start their show, yeah, let them do their show, are you guys staying,  is that what you're saying, I'm going to stay for a while, which is good, dude, we have  that side of the news until you guys come on, we avoid that side of the floor, we sneak  out this way, and we're out, out, no meetings for us, it's like Mission Impossible, we drop  down on cables through the elevator, look at Louie making believe he's got a fake phone  call, yes, Hollywood, yes, we just grabbed his phone and ran out like Hollywood's calling,  a three picture deal for LCK, just to think a year ago I was a soda jerk, and now look at 
[03:56:30]  me, Mad Cat Manhattan weekend, he thinks we haven't seen that move before, the fake  phone call, gets me out of the room immediately, what, my grandmother, I'll be right there,  guys, I gotta go, she fell and got cancer or something, it's so awful, and you can't be  the guy that questions it, you know, hold on, the reception's better on the other side 
[03:57:00]  of this door, yeah, hold on, during our meetings, I always tell Fez, when I cough, wait 30 seconds  and start crying, and we get, seriously, we've had two bladder meetings, and Watley's cried  during both of them, perfect, you have to cuddle you, does bladder try to hold your head,  no, he's not the touchy, he's not Wiki, no, he's not the touchy-feely Don Wickman type  of guy, Wiki would be like, Fez, Fez, Fez, yeah, that side of the building's a little 
[03:57:30]  more serious, yeah, literally, yeah, literally, it's just no XM, I don't even try to say serious  XM anymore, it's like, yeah, I work for serious, you see one XM on the badges or anything that  you got, no, nothing, no, no, it's getting smaller, you can see it, it's getting smaller,  they're finally purging, how was the fake phone call, well, it was good, it was,  I'm going to the Mets game, I just, fuck, I still haven't been to City, we thought, we  thought it was Jack Warner, Jack Warner, all right, let's get out of here, so a lot of 
[03:58:00]  Fez can do their program, what's on the show today there, Ronnie, a lot of great stuff,  stuff we've been thinking about, oh, hang out, we have a phone call, you're like us, you get  the, you're like us, you get the sheet and go, oh, this is what we're talking about  today, all right, Dave's ideas, Dave's ideas, I get a bit, don't you hate it when you're  eating shit and you accidentally cum, I don't think everyone does that, Dave, it doesn't 
[03:58:30]  work that way, the disgusting 1%, save that for the Sam and Dave show, when you guys argue  over what toy you're playing with, we officially fired Sam, though, he's fucking useless, it  really is, it was a hot girl that came walking by the window, we immediately hired her and  fired Sam, we had to make room for him, I thought that was Sam, no, you normally confuse for  hot girl, will she be wearing Mouseketeer ears too, or, yeah, you could divvy those up 
[03:59:00]  and really have some good Mouseketeer ears, why don't you guys, why don't you guys fucking end  every show with, M-I-C, see you real soon, kids, see you cunt, Ronnie's on to something  with a Mouseketeer, it's very close now, oh, that makes it straight, don't act like that  doesn't look stupid, don't act like, don't be outraged, I mean, go ahead and walk around  like that, but don't be like, what, crazy, that's the craziest, maybe it would look good 
[03:59:30]  if you own a Harley going 90 miles an hour, yeah, it makes no sense, what, it is really  dumb, I mean, you know what, you have to know it, right, you're being ironic with that,  right, Sam's gonna defend himself, that's not how a person walks around, I'm just saying  it's not a Mouseketeer, necessarily, oh, Jesus, and you should see, like it matters what's  stupid about it, like it matters what specifically is shitty about the haircut, punch up a picture  of his girlfriend, I mean, it looks retarded, not asshole-ish, and he's got a cute girlfriend 
[04:00:00]  and everything, it's a character look, no, it's like there's comedians that cut their  hair a certain way, and then that's their opening line, and they keep cutting, they go,  oh, look at me, well, you cut it like that, go fucking brush it out, and get a fucking axe,  fucking hack, oh, look at her, look at her, that's his girlfriend, seriously, that annoys  me, because he got stupid fucking bubble heads, that's your girlfriend, you guys asked me to 
[04:00:30]  grow my hair out, she's mine starting tomorrow, we told you about soulful eyes, some girls like  to be with guys that won't fuck them, she's got a weird quirk, that's not the case in this  situation, you should defend yourself on that a little bit, you know, she sees a guy with  hair like that, and goes, he won't have the balls to rape me, she wants him to cut it,  he'll buy me things and never have to fuck him, that's not what's going on at all, I know,  it's so unfair, I'm just, yeah, oh, yeah, she preferred it much shorter, what woman, 
[04:01:00]  I think America prefers it much shorter, this is from Afro Wars, which ended a year and a half  ago, Dave never admitted defeat, Dave's had two kids since that, he's insane, he's clinically  insane, yeah, well, that's true, so, Danny's got stupid hair too, what, what, no, Danny  doesn't have stupid hair, Danny looks like a, Danny has a hat, what happened, well, I try  to have a little, like, a little small talk with Dave, you know, between the two shows, 
[04:01:30]  he, and he panics and runs away, what's that about, he doesn't like you, at least I know  that, he's got an opie thing, he calls it, he puts candy in his asshole and then eats  it, so, when a guy does, puts candy in his asshole and then eats it, when you see him  in the hallway, you don't go, what am I, right, does he have a problem with me, why is he so  non-social, I figured I would try to get to know him finally, what did I do to upset that  fucking selfie weirdo, I figured, you know what, let's, let's, uh, get to know each 
[04:02:00]  other, yeah, sure, holy shit, he runs away, and Sam's gonna kill himself for the show  soon, which is awesome, I'm not, I've been asked to kill myself, he just hasn't figured  out which way yet, let's do it, Sam, I'm not going to, that's a big thing for the show,  oh, God, fuck, get out, just cause you heard your name, Dave, oh, hi, Dave, what's the  problem, man, I love you, that's why it's hard for me to talk to you, uncomfortable guy  stuff, yeah, see, alright, I'm leaving now, overacting, come on, we're on good terms  now, you don't want to be part of the overacting, Jerry, no, stop it, I'm the top acting, dude,
