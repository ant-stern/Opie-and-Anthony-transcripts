<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, fictional tale of a deadly virus, swiftly transitioning into a critique of daylight saving time and the perceived blandness of *CBS Sunday Morning*.  The hosts then celebrated the St. Louis Cardinals' World Series win, contrasting it with Opie's self-proclaimed "sports curse," and this led to a discussion of the most dangerous US cities (St. Louis and Detroit topping the list), punctuated by a recounting of a New York City stabbing near a falafel stand.  They debated reactions to line-cutters and the absurdity of political attack ads, particularly focusing on the bizarre Wisconsin race between Ron Kind and Paul R. Nelson (Nelson's ad attacking Kind's sex life research being a key highlight), along with a negative ad against Jim Webb.  Other topics included Opie's Denver cab experience, the O&A Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, their upcoming Halloween party (with O&A-themed costume requests and prize details), Madonna's adoption, Opie's football picks, and an anecdote about an old Frankenstein movie. Paul Stanley's upcoming appearance was also mentioned.

The show continued with a discussion of the absurdity of commercial edits in movies watched on TV versus DVD, highlighting the differences between watching *Die Hard* on TNT and on DVD.  The hosts reminisced about obtaining a rare copy of the Canadian TV movie *Crowhaven Farm* and discussed the *Star Wars Holiday Special*.  A significant portion focused on dissecting political attack ads, particularly those against Ron Kind and Paul Nelson (Nelson's controversial views on profiling Muslim men were highlighted), John Sweeney, and Vernon Robinson.  The hosts played and mocked these ads, along with a listener-submitted "Paul R. Nelson Megamix."  The news coverage of the Nelson-Kind race was briefly discussed.  The conversation shifted to generational differences in computer literacy, using President Bush's "Internets" gaffe as an example, before delving into the topic of "mancations," with anecdotes about trips to Brazil and Greece.  Paul Stanley's appearance was again mentioned, alongside promotion for their upcoming Halloween show and *FHM* magazine feature.

The "mancations" theme continued with a caller, George from Jersey, debating the reasons behind these trips and whether a "female element" was always involved.  The hosts discussed the varying costs and amenities of mancation-catering hotels.  Another listener called in about a "dumb and dumber" themed golfing mancation.  Paul Stanley then joined the show in-studio.  The conversation shifted to Stanley's experiences with KISS, his solo career, and the band's dynamics. Jim Norton shared an embarrassing photo anecdote.  They discussed Stanley's new album, *Live to Win*, and the upcoming *Kissology* DVD.  The segment concluded with the hosts and Paul Stanley participating in their XM radio station walk-over.

A later segment attempted to identify Black Oak Arkansas's hit song, leading to a highly sexually explicit and vulgar exchange with a caller, Eileen from Cleveland.  This transitioned into a discussion of a platinum Kiss album given to Jimmy Norton by a deceased friend, resulting in an uncomfortable discussion about accepting the gift.  The conversation then shifted to Norton's awkward interview with Paul Stanley and a subsequent encounter with Stanley's wife, who charged $50 for an autograph.  Norton detailed humorous and awkward interactions at a celebrity convention he attended with Big Kev, including encounters with Lori Petty and Todd Bridges, along with a Pat Rumunaki sighting.  Big Kev's interviews were played.  The segment was filled with vulgar language and sexually explicit discussions.

A particularly vulgar and sexually explicit discussion followed, focusing on Opie's great-aunt, "All the Way May," and her alleged sexual exploits,  using extremely offensive racial slurs and language. This transitioned into a discussion about a Madonna movie and listener calls with sexually charged jokes.  A pre-recorded interview with Paul Reubens (Pee-wee Herman) was played, followed by angry comments about Anthony Michael Hall's cancelled appearance.  The hosts discussed their Halloween party, taking listener calls with highly offensive costume suggestions.  The conversation touched on the *South Park* episode about Steve Irwin's death, and the segment continued with further sexually explicit banter and technical difficulties with a caller trying to get Halloween party tickets.  The "Line of the Day" was announced, which was also sexually explicit.

The final segment covered plans for their Halloween party, mentioning avoiding someone, and a man hitting on women.  The conversation shifted to seeing Bill Burr's stand-up show, describing Burr as both funny and a “dickhead.”  Multiple phone calls ensued, with one caller repeatedly placed on hold, leading to speculation about a recurring prank.  The phone call segment featured crude jokes about AIDS testing and masturbation.  Further calls were interspersed with discussion about Bill Burr tickets, a workplace budget meeting, and more sexually explicit jokes.  A frustrated caller, still trying to secure Halloween party tickets, expressed threats of violence.  The "Anthony Line of the Day" and website information were mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  The infection was everywhere. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Kills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours? It infects, replicates and kills this fast. These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules. There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is its phrax?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Where's the sun?  Where's the sun?  It's still too early. 
[00:01:30]  Didn't we, like, gain an hour of sleep or something?  Hope everybody fell back.  Fall back.  Spring ahead.  I was all excited last night.  I'm like, ah, fall back.  That means tomorrow it's going to feel like five when I get up.  No, it felt like four when I got up.  Yeah, it doesn't really work.  But don't you get a couple days where you feel like you're ahead of everything?  No.  No.  They do that, uh, that's why it's done, like, in the middle of the night. 
[00:02:00]  Like, Saturday into Sunday.  Yeah.  That way you're just going to be out longer.  Like, I saw people.  It was, uh, two in the morning.  And then it's one in the morning.  And you party like it's one.  You forget about that hour.  It's got to be the stupidest idea ever, by the way.  I got an idea.  Let's make it less light.  Isn't this the time of year you want to add light onto your day? 
[00:02:30]  Well, I believe it was because of the farmer.  The farmer.  Well, great.  Because look outside.  It's getting light out.  Right.  It wouldn't be light out for another hour.  Right.  So now the farmer can get up.  And you know how early farmers go to work.  Well, that was great in 1820.  Exactly.  2006.  Thank you.  Or, as Charles Osgood would say every Sunday morning, on this day, October 29th, 2006.  2006.  Stop it. 
[00:03:00]  You're the only one that says it correctly.  2006.  Ew.  2006.  Oh, it drives me nuts.  I watch every Sunday morning, that Sunday morning program.  That Sunday morning show depresses me.  Really?  I don't know why.  I don't like the big, stupid sun pictures they put on.  Yeah.  Those artsy-fartsy, like something with the music.  It's like cancer piano music.  Beyond conservative.  Yeah.  The show is made for very old people.  Yeah.  Don't look like, ugh.  Everything is so safe.  Every story they do is very safe. 
[00:03:30]  They could be talking about the Iraq war, and they make it just so safe on that show.  But they don't really even talk about that.  But it's usually like, Marjorie Smith has been collecting vases in the shape of elephants  for 25 years.  Right.  We visited her.  And they'll talk about vases in the shape of elephants.  And you want to take one and smash it over her head and kill her with it.  Braining with her own keepsake.  Yeah.  Well, yesterday, because, you know, Halloween's tomorrow, they did the sounds of bats in a 
[00:04:00]  cave in Montana.  We leave you with the sounds of bats in a cave in Montana.  Yeah.  On this day, Sunday, October 29th, 2006.  2006.  2006.  I get it.  You're intelligent.  You're an intellect.  We get it.  I'll see you on the radio.  Yeah, then he says that.  It's like...  That's his catchphrase.  Yeah, but we can't see you on the radio.  That's his joke.  So that's not accurate.  So why don't you say the date like everyone else? 
[00:04:30]  Because we all know it's not accurate.  But it just sounds better to say 2006.  2000.  No, he has to say 2006 every Sunday morning.  Sunday morning.  Where were we at?  Oh, yeah.  So there's dumb sun thing.  Yeah.  Why would you take away daylight in this day and age?  Yeah, because now in the afternoon, what is it?  It's dark by like 1.  1 in the afternoon.  1 p.m., it's starting to get dark now.  Yeah, right around Thanksgiving, it just gets ugly.  It's like, wait a minute.  I just ate lunch.  It's dark.  What happened?  Pitch black. 
[00:05:00]  You get done with work.  That's nighttime.  Got to go to bed.  Why don't we do something crazy as a society and just do away with it?  Just eliminate that.  Or add an hour at this point.  So, you know, you get out of work and you can maybe run around a little bit in the daylight.  I think they should just leave it the way it was before this weekend.  Just leaving them whatever time they call that.  It's standard or daylight savings.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  The farmer's selling his land anyway so they can build lots and lots of condos and houses.  He don't care.  Track housings all over the place so they're not farming anymore. 
[00:05:30]  Did you see that graph that was in USA Today over the weekend?  No.  With where people are living and what concentrations.  It's amazing.  People – you think America in, like you said, 2006 or 2006.  2006.  But apparently even today in 2006, people pretty much are concentrated where the Mayflower landed.  It's amazing. 
[00:06:00]  You look and it's like you see the northeast, the high concentration.  And then you go out to the – you know, Chicago is big.  Down the east coast, it's pretty big.  And then the middle of the country, it was like dot, dot, dot, little dot again.  And then the west coast, you know, again, California, L.A., pretty much, and San Francisco, areas like that.  But everywhere else, people just really gave up.  They stepped off of a few ships on the east coast and went, this looks good. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, we're just lazy.  Ah, this looks good to me.  You're known as being lazy.  It's like, ah.  I'm sure you've done a red eye.  Yeah.  And you look down in the middle of the night.  Nothing.  And you're like, wow, there's no lights on.  There's nothing down there.  And then all of a sudden you'll see a city here and there.  A big city pops up.  And you're like, okay, some people decided to settle there.  But for the most part, because it was a whole thing on – in a very short time, just a few short decades,  we're going to be at another 100 million people added to the country because we just passed the 300 million mark. 
[00:07:00]  It's going to be 400 million.  And every city claimed that they had the birth in their city.  Of course.  But they were like, where are we going to put these people?  Where are these people going to fit?  So they had a big map of the United States, and the dots represented 5,000 people.  And you couldn't even see a dot on the east coast.  It was just covered in red.  Right, right.  And certain cities in the west, same thing.  But the middle, dot, dot, no dots around it.  Like 5,000 people live there, and there's no one for 1,000 miles. 
[00:07:30]  And then there's bears and scary creatures until the next dot.  That's it.  You know something?  I don't like it.  I don't like the idea that the cities are getting crowded.  It's inconvenient.  There's savages moving in.  Whatever.  But there does seem to be a lot of room in this country.  People are dummies, man.  Why?  They're calling me out on the 2006 FUOP.  Did you used to say the year was 1,997?  No.  You said it was 1997. 
[00:08:00]  It's a different number in front now, jackass.  Therefore, douchebag, 2006 is correct.  I understand that 2006 is the correct way to say it.  You even said that.  Thank you, Anthony.  I just want people to listen before they have to write their instant feedback.  I did say that.  You said he's saying it the way it should be said, but no one says it that way.  But no one says it that way, and that's what annoys the crap out of me on a Sunday morning.  Everyone says 2006.  He's trying to be an intellect.  Him and his New York Times reader friends.  2006. 
[00:08:30]  Leave you with the sounds of people changing the channel before my show starts.  The only reason I watch is because, you know, the pregame don't start that early when  I get up because of these dumb hours.  I'm up early.  So, yes, drink the coffee and watch a little CBS Sunday morning.  Sunday morning.  With Charles Osgood in his stupid bow tie.  Everything is just wrong about that guy.  Creepy pictures of the sun that are painted or sculptures that they zoom in on before they  go to commercials.  Yeah.  Oh, scary faces on them, smiling like they're ready to come in the night and kill you. 
[00:09:00]  Ugh.  Creepy show.  I hate human interest stories.  Don't you?  Really?  They're usually awful.  They can be interesting, but they're normally about an old person and they're knickknacks.  Right.  God damn, you are absolutely right.  That's what that show's about.  Old people and their knickknacks.  Somebody in diapers and their collection of bric-a-brac.  Bric-a-brac.  Hey, can I go to Detroit?  Please.  Sorry, Detroit. 
[00:09:30]  We'll get into what I did to you in a minute.  Jimmy in Detroit, what's up?  Hey, I don't think that guy's even saying it right.  Wouldn't it be 20-0-6?  Wouldn't it be 20-0-6?  We all do say oh, but officially it's a zero, right?  I say ought.  Ought?  I say 20-ought-6 is how I pronounce it and write it in emails.  20-ought-6.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And congratulations to the St. Louis Cardinals.  But don't fret. 
[00:10:00]  They're also the murder capital of the country this morning.  Well, really?  No, I think they came in first.  No, they came in first.  First?  Wow.  All right.  Congrats.  Remember last week we were saying how nice St. Louis is and how white it is?  They won that also against Detroit?  And how conservative?  Yeah.  First and second.  Detroit just got their ass kicked by St. Louis in a few categories over the weekend.  Wow.  Remember how nice we were saying St. Louis is and how white and how they can't commit to 
[00:10:30]  everything and that's why they have that dumb arch?  They wanted to keep going up and they were like, oh, no, no, no.  We have to bring it back down.  Bring it down.  Bring it down.  Well, yes.  They topped the list of the most dangerous cities to live in.  Wow.  Most dangerous.  Beating out Detroit.  Detroit is in second place now.  St. Louis is number one.  Come on, Detroit.  Well, let's be honest.  That's because of East St. Louis.  Oh, is it?  Oh.  Oh.  Holy St. Louis.  Lou.  Yeah.  Well, last week I left you, the Tigers had a chance at winning the World Series and, 
[00:11:00]  wow, the Cardinals just took care of Detroit.  Wait, wait, wait.  Tigers had a chance.  Let me tell you something.  They were heavily favored.  This was a guaranteed win.  You, you, Opie, had said, oh, my God, it's all about Detroit.  They're going to just take this.  It didn't even matter.  They had won the World Series before they played the first game, according to you, and  then a lot of sportscasters jumped on the bandwagon saying, you know, Detroit in four. 
[00:11:30]  You would guarantee to win.  Yeah, well.  And there's a little something over the years known as the Opie Sports Curse.  And the new listeners, they think this is just a little radio show goof.  They have no idea how deep this goes.  They do not understand.  This is real.  I don't know what logic, what science is behind it.  It's some kind of witchcraft.  It all started when Opie slapped Lou Gehrig on the back and said, I hear your blood is healthy, Lou.  Don't worry.  That cough will go away. 
[00:12:00]  It's just a dumb cough.  They've got it, too.  You're fine.  Have a lozenge.  It's going around the locker room.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  And it's real.  If Opie really wants a team to win, it can't just be something like, Opie, say that you're  rooting for this team today because I want the other team to win.  It doesn't work like that.  You have to actually believe that a team is going to win.  Right.  And have reason for it, too.  There could be complete reason. 
[00:12:30]  Who didn't think Detroit was just going to run away with this?  Well, it was getting scary because people would call up and go, who do you think Sunday?  And they would just throw out two teams.  And I just was like, stop.  Because they're trying to win money off me.  Of course.  You know, they're trying to win money off this unusual talent I have of not picking the game.  But it is real.  I mean, when you really get behind a team and you want them to win or you favor them to win,  they will lose.  I don't care how heavily favored they are, how good it looks on paper.  And it goes back to living in Buffalo.  I'm telling you. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I was there for all, I was there for three out of the four Super Bowls.  Oops.  Three out of the four.  And it's just, it's just been a weird thing ever since.  There's some kind of like curse.  Poor, poor Detroit.  How, how disappointing.  Heavily favored.  And they go down to the Cardinals.  The stupid safe Cardinals.  You guys want to hum a bar of why don't you meet me in St. Louis, Louis?  Awful.  Stupid arches.  Nothing but a white. 
[00:13:30]  White audience.  Audience.  Well.  Nothing but white spectators for the games in their red baseball caps.  And then they, uh, they win, uh, the crime too.  And they win the crime.  Look at that.  For the unsafest city.  That's right.  St. Louis and Detroit in another big battle, but this one, no one wanted to win.  Happy about it.  Murder.  Another big battle.  Murder.  One's about hitting a baseball around, the other's murder.  In another big battle, but this one, no one wanted to win. 
[00:14:00]  The most dangerous city in America was for the title, right?  Just days after clinching a World Series victory, St. Louis also wins the unadmirable distinction.  A violent crime there has surged 20% this year.  20%?  Detroit came in second, followed by Flint and Compton, California.  Camden, New Jersey rounds out the top five.  The mayor of Camden says that's good news, though.  That's because Camden was named the most dangerous city two years in a row.  Trenton and Newark are also in that top 25. 
[00:14:30]  New Jersey also had the safest American city, Brick, New Jersey, and Amherst, New York,  is safe and sound in second.  And Amherst, New York, is outside Buffalo there, just in case you're wondering.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, but how about Camden, New Jersey?  Are they celebrating today?  They must be.  They've been the murder capital of the world.  Well, not the world.  I mean, there's some awful, awful places out there, but in the country for many years.  What are they burning down in celebration?  Are they burning something or killing people?  Probably a brand-new condo complex, you know. 
[00:15:00]  We used to be on the list, didn't we, New York City, years ago?  Probably back in, like, 1979.  Yeah, been off the list for quite a while, although we had a really great murder over the weekend.  This guy at the falafel stand.  There's a big falafel stand.  You know the one down on 53rd and 6th where that line, it's a line that goes down the block?  Yeah, I know it well, actually, because when we went to the SNL After Hours party, it's right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, and people line up after the bars close and the clubs close, and they get their falafel before they head back to the suburbs. 
[00:15:30]  The line is ridiculous.  It's like a city block long.  And this is what?  6th and what?  No, it's 53rd and 6th Avenue, I believe, somewhere around there.  Tucked in there.  Yeah, and the line gets crazy starting at, like, 2 in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, so this was about 4 in the morning or somewhere around there.  And somebody apparently cut another gentleman in line.  And the gentleman and his girl commented on the fact that, hey, I think we're in line here. 
[00:16:00]  And they got into their cars, their respective cars, and a chase started.  And for some reason, the guy ended up getting stabbed in the back.  The paper's never, it's always so vague.  Like, did they stop?  Did they get out of the car?  Did the guy walk up to the window?  The guy rolled it down?  He leaned over his steering wheel and got stabbed in the back?  Wait, he got stabbed while he was in his car?  I don't know.  This stupid friggin' news never gives you enough info. 
[00:16:30]  This is what I heard.  And the guy did something we all do.  If you see a cutter, you're like, hey, you're cutting me.  Hey.  We've all done it.  Yeah.  So nothing happened at the falafel stand about a block away.  I guess they were all, you know, walking to get their cars from the garages over on 7th, maybe.  And then they happened to see the guy again.  And then there was another confrontation.  Oh, there's the cutter guy.  Right.  And then they got into a confrontation, stabbed, and then he took off, and then the cops got him.  Well, who got down the way?  I heard there was a car chase. 
[00:17:00]  Really?  I heard there was a car chase through two, blew a couple of lights, and then the guy was stabbed in the back.  Wow.  See, that's completely different.  The guy that got cut.  The guy with his girlfriend got stabbed?  He got cut and stabbed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The only one was a dumb falafel.  Stupid falafel.  I hate people that cut.  Oh, don't you hate it?  I hate cutters.  Go to Great Adventure here in Six Flags.  Great Adventure in Jersey.  Oh, boy.  You'll be cut, and you will let them cut.  Why? 
[00:17:30]  Because they don't just cut.  It's amazing.  They swing on a vine and cut in front of you.  It's just...  You know what's great about that?  Right.  If you're at Great Adventure and people are cutting you, no one's brave.  I know.  Of course not.  Every time we say this, people will call up, I don't care where I am when someone cuts me.  I say something.  Oh, you don't say a word.  But the average person would not say something in the situation you just mentioned.  Don't say a word.  A falafel stand, three in the morning, someone cuts you, probably not going to say something.  No. 
[00:18:00]  Starbucks, no problem.  Yeah.  Hey!  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  Going to get your library card.  There's a line, someone cuts you.  Hey, I'm speaking up.  We all like to think we're the tough guys out there, and we defend our turf all the time.  No.  You pick your spots.  Starbucks, you're making a scene.  That Fidel cat.  Yeah, he's...  Oh, he's dead.  He's on his way.  He's on his way out.  He's trying to prove that he's fine, but...  Wow.  But nah.  He got the look of the big C.  Yeah, he doesn't look good. 
[00:18:30]  But there you go.  So that guy, yeah.  Dead.  Dead, right?  Yeah, that's nice.  Over falafel cutting.  So...  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We got lots to do today.  Oh, well, we can play this.  This is going to piss off Detroit today.  I'm sorry, Detroit, but we just got to go for the rest of the country.  Oh, you got to play the highlight.  This is how it went down.  And at the plate for the Tigers.  First, strike two.  Last night, Inge hit a fastball.  He hasn't seen one at this at bat yet. 
[00:19:00]  For the first time since 1982, St. Louis has a World Series winner.  I don't like the way he put that.  Huh?  I don't like the way they say that.  For the first time since 1982.  1982.  Yeah.  That's a long time ago now.  24 years.  Yeah, it's true, but I mean...  It's now 2006. 
[00:19:30]  I mean, come on.  20-aught.  All right, we're getting warmed up.  We got lots to do today.  We have lots to do today.  More negative campaign ads on the way.  Some really, really good ones.  Maybe we'll get into that.  We'll get into that after the break.  We also got Paul Stanley stopping by to say hi today.  I'm Paul R. Stanley.  Paul.  Oh, the other guy.  Huh?  He's doing the walkover with us, too.  Yeah, he's doing the walkover.  So if you want to meet Paul Stanley outside the station, we'll definitely be out there with him.  We got Jim Norton on Letterman.  Monday, Wednesday. 
[00:20:00]  Wednesday, right?  Halloween party tomorrow night.  We'll give you all the details.  I hope so.  And I hope you're wearing a costume that has something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  That's what we do every year.  Yeah.  Don't do the pregnant nun and all that crap.  Who cares?  It has to be a costume that has something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got some fine prizes to the best costume tomorrow night.  Right.  Have we given our tickets yet?  What do we have on tickets?  Yeah, we did all that.  Okay.  I think we got a few more tickets we're going to give away on the walkover tomorrow.  Is that the case?  Tomorrow, right?  Let's do that tomorrow. 
[00:20:30]  We got last-minute Halloween tickets to give away tomorrow on the walkover when we go from here to XM.  All right, we'll take a break, and we'll get into some cool things next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest has been rejuvenated thanks to a visit from a very girthy honey from Bingham to New York who tipped the scales at 505 pounds and obliterated the competition.  But this doesn't mean there isn't someone larger who can't pry herself off the sofa, hoist her barely-breathing, blubbery body up to our studios, and limp away with a grand prize. 
[00:21:00]  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the contest gets $10 for every memory-repressing, artery-clogging pound on her body.  So if you spend more time upholstering your flesh with cupcakes than you do looking in a mirror, sign up for the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Details on opieandanthony.com.

Our regular show in the morning, and then we're broadcasting our Halloween party from the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City tomorrow night. 
[00:22:00]  Yes.  We'll have some last-minute tickets to give away on the walkover tomorrow.  Costume contest.  We're looking for costumes that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anything, no matter how vague.  I'm sure we're going to see people dressed as Nazis tomorrow.  I'm sure there's going to be a Monster Rain-type costume tomorrow night.  I'm talking about the people that forgot it was Halloween.  No costume.  I'm sure there's going to be some kind of cake-stomping costume tomorrow. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know how they're going to pull that off, but our listeners are very creative.  Treat yourself!  Treat yourself!  Treat yourself!  I couldn't stop doing that and the Paul R. Nelson.  The whole time I was in Denver, all I was doing was walking around.  Treat yourself!  Oh, no, my cake!  And I'm Paul R. Nelson.  That's all I could do.  Cake-stomping videos up on YouTube.  It's officially in the top five of Opie and Anthony videos. 
[00:23:00]  It's probably more people.  It has to spread.  We have to get non-O&A people to enjoy that.  It's spreading.  It's happening for the homeless.  Oh, it's spreading.  The Stern fans are having a field day just trying to beat us up over that video.  Or beat me up personally about that video.  How do we not enjoy that?  That's what makes me laugh.  Yeah, exactly.  If you're a fan of his show, let's be honest, you're going to enjoy the cake-stomping video.  And who cares?  But they're just fighting a battle.  They're fighting a battle in the comments. 
[00:23:30]  The Pest and the Stern fans.  It's just a stupid video.  Just enjoy it.  But now, you know, the Stern fans are beating me up.  So then the Pest are fighting back.  It's a whole thing on the comments.  It's like, I don't know, something like 800 comments.  They are there.  800 comments over the 40-second video clip.  Or whatever.  It is.  But go to YouTube and check it out.  Or opianthony.com.  I exposed myself in Denver for a second being a douchebag.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  You know how I'm like, I'm never a douchebag to fans or in public.  Usually I try to, you know, get my cool.  But I was a douchebag to a fan.  I never do that.  I just ate dinner after you saw Jimmy Norton kill, of course, killed in Denver.  Loved my little Jimmy.  Thank you for you.  And then I went up to the Capitol Grill, had a nice dinner.  But at that point, I was shot. 
[00:24:30]  Just gone.  There's just something about being in Denver that just makes you exhausted.  I don't know what the hell it is.  There's no air.  And there's no air to breathe.  They're telling you to drink the water all the time.  When you said that on stage, man, I'm cracking up because that's all I didn't even tell you.  You're high up.  You've got to drink water.  Drink plenty of water.  Water, water, water, water.  Water.  Lots of water.  You need water.  There's, like, gallons of it in your hotel room.  It's just.  Have some water.  Would you like some water first?  No.  I wouldn't.  You've got to drink water before your water. 
[00:25:00]  So I was, and I was really tired, so I'm just sitting at dinner waiting and, you know, eating.  And we decide, you know, it's time to leave and try to get a cab.  Now, when you're from New York City, it's one thing to get a cab.  There are days where it's really difficult to get a cab.  But for the most part.  You just throw your hand up in the air.  You put your hand up.  And then you've got ten cabs fighting for you.  And there's a whole thing that, like, the cabs have lights on them here in New York.  They say, off duty. 
[00:25:30]  And you can see them way down the block.  You say, oh, that guy's off duty.  Or their light will be off, which means there's a fare in the cab.  You know not to try to hail him down.  Or you see his light on, which means raise your hand.  He's ready for action.  Denver?  I'm a cab.  That's pretty much all you got.  I'm a cab.  Is there someone in here?  Am I off duty?  Am I driving someone?  Am I picking someone up? 
[00:26:00]  Your guess as good as mine.  Well, the best is going to some of these cities.  And they'll pick you up even though they have people in there.  Yeah, what's that about?  Well, that's the Long Island cabs.  I mean, most of those drivers are on crystal meth or something anyway.  But all of a sudden they stop and they pick you up.  Where are you going?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  But there's someone in your cab already.  Yeah, but they're going to blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  I'll get you after that.  They're not real cab drivers.  I don't know what's going on.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So you find yourself hailing every single cab on the street.  Any cab that goes by, you raise your hand and you see there are people in there. 
[00:26:30]  And they look at you like, look at this idiot trying to get the cab.  And this guy.  So it had to be about 20 minutes.  And it's cold.  It's Denver.  It's cold.  I didn't have my big heavy jacket on.  So I'm cold.  I'm tired and I'm cranky and I can't get a cab.  How awful is that when they keep driving by and you keep trying to expose more skin just  to show them your lack of melanin?  Like, look, I'll take my hood down.  Like, look at my innocent face. 
[00:27:00]  I'm just a law-abiding, employed citizen trying to get a ride home to my hotel.  So what happened?  Well, a fan, right at one point where I raise my hand to hail a cab that I think is empty  because his light is on.  Yeah.  And he starts pulling over.  And I walk up and there's people in it.  He was just stopping at a light.  So I'm like, mother.  And I throw out my usual string of about four or five curses that never fit together. 
[00:27:30]  They don't fit together.  They're just random curse words.  The C word, everything came out.  And it was just as a fan was coming over.  And he goes, Anthony.  And he goes to shake my hand.  And the words were still coming out of my mouth.  And I had that look on my face.  And I just turned at him and continued the spew of the lines.  And he's like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  So I was like, ah, dude, I'm sorry.  I just got to get the F out of here.  And there's no cabs.  So he's like, I'll get you a cab. 
[00:28:00]  And he gets out on the road and starts hailing cabs.  But he's having the same luck I'm having.  So I just walked away from the situation.  And found one around the corner.  But I was livid.  A lot of cities have no protocol to their taxi.  Taxi things are like, it's not as important as they are here in New York, I guess.  Well, you got to call for a cab in a lot of these cities.  Yep.  You got to call.  And that's why, you know, they're not stopping for it.  Because they already have people.  Because someone called for them.  But that's a pain in the ass.  By the way, backing up, the Opie and Anthony Halloween show costume contest is sponsored in part by Rob Zombie's new releases, Educated Horses, and Millennium Collection. 
[00:28:30]  And the Millennium Collection.  It is.  They're sponsoring that as well.  I have so many in-show plugs.  I don't even know.  We're not even going to be able to do a radio show today.  Dan's like, you got to do the football one twice.  You got to do the Halloween one twice.  The costume contest once.  Fatty pig fatty once.  Cha-ching.  Cha-ching is right.  They're selling this program.  All right.  Where do you want to go? 
[00:29:00]  We got Paul R. Nelson.  Well, you talked about Paul R. Nelson.  Well, Ron Kind is finally fighting back.  No way.  Yeah.  Ron Kind is fighting back.  This is the congressional battle in Wisconsin.  And I got to tell you, it is a doozy.  It's wonderful.  Oh, I love it.  The news has been jumping on the negative ads.  I'm proud to say that we got on that early.  I know.  Bobby, I like to say we broke the story here on this program.  All the shows would say that because they're so stupid. 
[00:29:30]  We just know we got on to it a little earlier than most people this year.  It's one of those things.  Every election, it just gets worse and worse.  And this year is really bad.  They're pulling out a lot of personal crap.  And the one in Wisconsin is Paul R. Nelson against Ron Kind.  The wrong kind.  The wrong kind.  The wrong kind.  If you listen to Paul R. Nelson.  Right, right.  Paul R. Nelson is the family-oriented conservative Republican.  No, Paul R. Nelson is a douche.  Well, of course. 
[00:30:00]  He's also a real estate agent and a former Marine.  But I don't know what years he was in the Marines.  And a hockey dad.  And a hockey dad, which he's a self-proclaimed hockey dad.  I've never heard anyone else call him that.  And Ron Kind.  Paul Nelson calls Ron Kind.  He puts a W at the beginning of Ron and a G at the end to make it look like wrong kind.  He's the incumbent.  He's been there, what, four terms.  Really doesn't want to get into the negative side of this whole thing. 
[00:30:30]  We had him scheduled to come on our show.  Yeah, but you passed.  Oops, I guess somebody got to him and blew it.  You blew it for us.  Yeah, sometimes the pests have to realize they got to keep their stupid yaps shut for a couple of days.  Yeah, help us out a little bit.  Help us out, Hendry.  You can't just get on the phone and on the e-mails and start bashing this guy in our name  when you know we're trying to get him on the phone and make some fun radio out of it.  We love Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:31:00]  We almost had him on the show today.  He would have been on the show today, but the pests screwed it up.  He got wind of what we were all about, and they canceled.  I understand we got to take the bad with the good.  It is.  It's like trying to train a gorilla, the pest.  It's impossible.  You wonder why at one minute he's sign languaging for a banana and petting your head,  and the next he's ripping your larynx out and ripping off your feet.  And drinking his own you-know-what.  Right, right.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  No, at this time I needed you to eat the cake in front of everybody. 
[00:31:30]  He looks civilized for a minute, like the little chimp is wearing the engineer coveralls  and the hat, and he's running around, and he looks so cute.  And the next minute he's taking a finger and jamming it somewhere, smelling it, and falling  off a log.  Right.  I love that video.  But you're all proud, like, look, look.  Look at him.  I trained him to read.  Look, isn't he cute?  Oh, I didn't train him to do that.  That means he wants an apple.  Yeah.  That means apple.  Look, he's signing.  And now what's he doing? 
[00:32:00]  Okay, he's throwing his feces.  Right.  Because you know why?  Because he's a monkey.  And the pests are the pests, and we love when they get behind a good cause and really work  it for us.  But we do have to realize they are just pests.  So that when we mention something like Ron Kind.  Oh, wait.  Ron Kind was the one that canceled.  He canceled, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was Paul R. Nelson.  No, Ron Kind was the guy we're behind.  I think we could still get Paul R. Nelson on the show.  We should get Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah.  Paul R. Nelson, we're supposedly getting on. 
[00:32:30]  So pest, could you just knock it off for a few minutes and let us get this guy on, and  then you can have your fun with him?  Well, here's the anti-Ron Kind commercial that we just love.  And then finally, Ron Kind is fighting back, but barely.  Barely.  He doesn't want to be part of this.  Doesn't want to commit.  He's not into the mudslinging.  Poor term incumbent.  Why should he bother?  And this guy is like a newbie.  Yeah.  So he's just kind of swatting him down like, go away.  Ah, enough of you.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day, what kind of congressman would try 
[00:33:00]  to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need  to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study  the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease, Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation  habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited 
[00:33:30]  Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with  probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  All weekend long. 
[00:34:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I was just, like, shuffling around my apartment in my PJs.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  That could be the worst voice I've ever heard.  Horrid.  Do you just picture, like, retard haircut?  But do you want that voice representing you?  Do you know what he looks like?  Does anybody have a picture of Paul R. Nelson?  What do you think it looks like?  I don't want to look at one.  I say...  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I say, like, thick glasses with, like, thick black rims.  Probably just an awkward-looking crew cut. 
[00:34:30]  I know he happens to be a real estate agent now.  Yeah.  Is what he's doing.  So I just picture that look.  I know the look of real estate agents.  I've seen enough of them.  Yeah.  It's usually, you know, the same mold kind of...  Vultures.  Vultures.  Paul R. Nelson.  That's him?  Really?  You got a picture of him?  Yeah, he looks like he would have been, like, homecoming king back in the day.  He looks like he was an athlete.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, he looks like he's one of those guys, you know. 
[00:35:00]  The goody two-shoes guy at the frat house.  Is that what it says?  Our children's future.  Is that a little small line on his website?  Our children's future.  What's wrong with now?  How come everything's got to look toward the goddamn future and the children?  What's wrong with now and who's on this earth right now?  Because no politician wants to take on now.  How about now?  That's how they skate.  They always want to talk about the future.  The future.  You know, our children's future is going to be horrible if we have people like Ron Kind in there. 
[00:35:30]  How about right now?  No one could take on today's issues.  They don't want to.  They don't have enough time.  Ron Kind will.  That means they would have to sacrifice a lot.  They would have to set up stuff that wouldn't be popular.  And it has to be working while they're still in office.  And it could show that they're doing nothing.  And some of these projects would take, you know, a decade to 20 years and no one would ever remember who actually initiated to begin with.  Or they would remember that person as being the ass that had to, you know, mess things up to make things better. 
[00:36:00]  No one wants to do that.  So they talk about the future.  The only thing I want to see done for children's future is vasectomies.  That's what I want to see done.  Some nice radiation by the testes.  Enough.  Speaking of the future, Madonna's baby in the paper.  Oh, did you see him today?  Wow, that guy's got a nice future ahead of him.  Dude, last week, that kid was in a burlap like friggin' loincloth.  With a stick trying to dig out a slug somewhere. 
[00:36:30]  Trying to get a slug so he could eat for the day.  Right, now he's in what, brand new Nike's?  Brand new little Nike's.  He's got some nice little jogging suit on.  The kid is rocking.  He's adorable.  He's all clean.  There isn't one bit of snot around his nose.  No crackly snot.  You think he's aware at this point in the crib, just like, oh my god.  This is different.  I won the mommy lotto.  I'm back in the womb.  This is great.  How did this happen?  This kid has been given the ultimate second chance. 
[00:37:00]  Look at him.  He is dressed to the nines.  He's got his cute little osh-gosh-bogosh clothes on.  He looks like a baby pimp.  That kid, his clothes are more expensive than pretty much 99.9% of the population of America.  This guy, this baby's wearing better clothes.  He's twice the weight he was when she first found him.  He's actually getting fat.  Look how chubby his arm is.  And he's adorable.  Oh, he's adorable. 
[00:37:30]  Gotta love that.  Look at him.  She adopted the cute baby.  I'm sure there's been, I'm sure there were some ugly babies that she could have chose from.  It's kind of like picking a pumpkin.  Page eight, Jimmy.  Anthony, it's kind of like picking a pumpkin.  Picking a pumpkin for Halloween.  No one wants the ugly pumpkin.  She went over there.  The one with the flat side.  She went over there and she walked around the fields like she was looking for a pumpkin.  A good pumpkin.  Like the ultimate pumpkin.  One you could be proud of.  He's a cute kid, though.  That's why she picked it.  Beyond cute. 
[00:38:00]  That's what we're getting at, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Why would Madonna...  She wasn't going to pick an ugly pumpkin.  Not going to pick an ugly one.  A pumpkin with a big bruise or it looks good and then you turn it over and it's flat.  It's flat on the one side.  It's got mold.  Right, right.  You don't want a moldy pumpkin.  You want a nice one.  She picked a perfect pumpkin.  She went pumpkin picking in Africa.  He had little fat baby hands.  Yeah, look.  Fat baby hands.  And they were emaciated.  He had nothing.  He was a skinny, diseased, little African child a week ago. 
[00:38:30]  Madonna is a cure.  And you know Madonna, just what you read about her?  I bet she's attempting to breastfeed even though she's, you know, that's impossible because  she's not pregnant or had a kid recently.  But you know that she's that twisted in her head that she's trying to, like, breastfeed  the African child.  I don't know.  Because we're all one big mother on the earth.  Shut up, are we?  Is that what you are?  Adopt an ugly kid with AIDS and then I'll respect you.  Then I'll respect you and go, wow, you're doing something great for society.  Taking a hungry kid and making him Fred Berry. 
[00:39:00]  Caught on camera walking through JFK Airport on their way to the Material Moms New York  base.  This kid's winging all over the world with Madonna.  Yeah.  He's all plump now.  No respect.  No respect.  Just won the kid lotto.  That's it.  All right.  Well, here's moving backwards a little bit.  Wrong kind is fighting back against Paul R. Nelson.  You know how his whole ad should be this? 
[00:39:30]  Listen to this voice.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Is this the man you want representing you?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  He sounds like a dork.  Because he is one.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  Now go to your room.  Could you picture him at home?  Honey?  Honey, I'm going to the Home Depot.  Do you need anything?  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:40:00]  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  He's a fun buster.  The dust buster, when he comes into the party, all the fun just clings to him and he walks  out.  Fun is completely sucked out.  You can't even find any in the couch cushions.  Yeah, well.  It looks like he has the perfect family.  It's just the voice that's all messed up there.  He's going with that whole thing, the real conservative, family-oriented thing.  And, of course, he's portraying Ron Kind as this wild liberal nutjob who's just throwing 
[00:40:30]  around your tax money at naked women and old men.  Vietnamese hookers and bisexual Alaskans.  Vietnamese whores.  Yeah, Alaskans, whatever they are.  This Ron Kind has never seen anything with two legs.  He doesn't want to mount.  The truth of the matter is he voted for some bill that was a sex study, a study on human  sexuality.  Right.  And it included all these things like how older people would be best suited for their 
[00:41:00]  sexuality.  You know, how they get along as they get older as far as sex is concerned.  A viable thing.  Nothing I'd throw money to.  I could give a crap.  Right.  What old people are doing with each other.  But it's not one of these things like he's in a peep booth slipping dollar bills through  there to watch grandpa do grandma.  It's just it's part of a bill.  But they don't describe it like that.  No, they don't. 
[00:41:30]  Well, Ron, Paul Arnelson wants it to sound like he's out there, you know, living the  life.  Well, Ron Kind is fighting back.  I got to hear this battle.  All right.  Here's I don't think we've heard Ron Kind.  No.  All right.  Finally, this is what Ron Kind has to say about Paul Arnelson.  You know, growing up in western Wisconsin and playing football, you expect basically  saying football cooler than hockey.  All right.  OK.  He's getting out here.  He's a football dad. 
[00:42:00]  You expect to get a little muddy.  It's part of the game, but it shouldn't be a part of politics.  Mud slinging campaigns don't create jobs, educate our kids.  Or provide better health care for anyone.  Let's get the mud out of politics and leave it on the football field where it belongs.  I'm Ron Kind, and we approve this message.  Oh, boy.  Wow, I hate him, too.  Oof.  Just completely ignoring what Paul Arnelson is saying about him. 
[00:42:30]  What a douche.  He does an Ovaltine commercial.  Yeah.  More positive messages, Ron.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a sunny D spot.  Boring.  God.  Dude, just go at it with the guy.  Hit him back a little.  He's saying, no, that mud slinging doesn't belong in politics.  I don't care how true Paul Arnelson was, how honest he was.  Keep it on the football field, along with all those soldiers I'll ignore. 
[00:43:00]  Ron Kind is a nerd.  We approve this message.  All the kids cheer.  We like positive politics as well, man.  And I really want to get behind Ron Kind.  He should have went after his voice.  I'm Ron Kind, and I don't use swishy S's when I talk.  You know, just do something.  If you talk to Paul Arnelson, Ron Kind wouldn't mind you getting behind him over here.  Sounds like that type of guy.  I'm Ron Kind, and I don't say my S's like I'm holding a yam bag in my mouth.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:43:30]  Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I have a touch of a cold.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  When you get to the S, you have to throw your tongue out of your mouth.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  And then you've got to get a lot of saliva.  Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  His lip probably comes up.  Nelson.  When I was in the Marine Corps, and my buddies pinned me down with a blanket and hit me with soap.  And I screamed, no, ow, ow, ow. 
[00:44:00]  They were paying for it, so I ate it.  I ate it.  Once there was a donut in my footlocker.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Private Nelson.  Only faggots and sailors are called Private Nelson.  Is this good?  It'll get it.  Who said that?  Who said that?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, no.  Are these good?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Paul R. Nelson, we've got a brand new... 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no!  Paul says Muslim men, 17 to 40, should be profiled.  All right.  Muslim woman...  I'm liking him now.  He doesn't agree.  I want to vote for this dude.  I want to vote for Paul R. Nelson against everything I believe in.  Ron Kind.  Except that Muslim thing.  I agree with him.  Ron Kind is probably this bleeding heart douche.  And this guy's like a hardcore ex-Marine, but because he says his S is wrong, we hate  him.  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  Not voting for you because of your S's.  Yes.  That's what it comes down to. 
[00:45:00]  By the way, the football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  That's a lot of upsets yesterday.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was very natural.  Yeah.  I didn't even notice we were talking about one thing and then boom.  Dude, there's so many in-show plugs.  I just...  It's stupid.  Who won the Monday night football game?  That answer is going to be sponsored by...  I know.  The Browns took care of my Jets yesterday.  That did not make me happy.  I know we're on in Cleveland, so hey, Cleveland, congrats. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, wait a minute, though.  Wasn't that one of Jim Belushi's picks?  Yeah, Jim Belushi picked the Browns over the Jets for me.  Oh.  I was not happy about it, but it was one of the only picks I got right this week.  Oh, you didn't do too well?  Nah, I went...  How did our own Steve do?  I went two for five.  Steve went two for five.  Steve is still in the lead for the $10,000 up for grabs.  Yes.  Thanks to Dish Network.  $10,000.  Steve's got 24 picks right so far this year, and then a bunch of us have 20.  Like, just about the rest of us have 20.  It's good I could furnish my den before the cold weather comes.  Steelers blew it yesterday. 
[00:46:00]  A lot of weird upsets yesterday.  I hated Steve's responsible answer when I said, what are you going to do with the money?  Home repairs.  Home repairs.  Are you really, bore?  I'm going to do them myself.  Put in a little sweat equity.  All right, we'll break.  We'll continue.  We got more.  We got Paul R. Nelson supports racial profiling.  So I guess Ron Kanda is going after him.  The Paul R. Nelson mega mix on the way.  Anti-Jim Webb political ad.  Is this one good, Danny? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Thumbs up.  All right.  Jim Webb.  And then the one that.  Yeah, the Jim Webb one was, wow.  That's a good one?  That story broke over the weekend, and apparently he's an author.  Oh, really?  Who likes dirty little stories.  Oh, that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good story.  He likes to write dirty little stories.  All right, we'll get into that.  Back in the 70s.  And then we got Vernon Robinson political ads for North Carolina.  Yeah.  Talking about Cosby.  And man, if you're black, I mean, this is pretty.  Is it?  This is pretty interesting, too.  There's another ad that was dubbed racist because there's a white girl saying, call me at the end of the spot. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And the guy is black.  So they made that a whole racial thing about how it's in a state where if a black man looked at a white woman, he would be hung.  Yeah.  And it's just the fact that he, you know, is supposedly because of the ads that he frequents some of these clubs and likes the women.  So they were kind of throwing that in and they used a white woman.  All right.  Well, we'll we'll step aside when we get to kill us. 
[00:47:30]  When we get back, we'll get right into it.  We also have to get into Bush saying the Google over the weekend.  Pretty funny.  Who doesn't say it like that?  And something we've been following on the Internet, something we've been following closely.  Another story on man.  Cations.  Lots to do today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for showtime.  It's the Opian Anthony Show. 
[00:48:00]  The virus is spreading.  Opian Anthony!  What's up, Chicago?  We're taking a peek at you guys.  More than a peek.  We're keeping tabs on Chicago.  Watching you.  See, watch this.  The Chicago Steves killed the 49ers yesterday.  Yeah.  The Chicago Steves are now 7-0. 
[00:48:30]  Chicago Steves?  Chicago Bears.  You idiot, Jimmy.  I actually thought there was like a college team or something called the Chicago Steves.  And what a dope I am.  I'm jumping on it like, let's make fun of it.  Like no one else caught it.  The Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I like the way Carl Daniel does his hair.  Yeah, right on.  Yeah, I was watching horror movies on the American Movie Classic channel.  American Movie Classics. 
[00:49:00]  And they had like the first Frankenstein movie on.  Black and white from like, I don't know, 1908.  Who knows?  Looked real old.  That was old.  Was it 34?  And he's trying to get body parts.  And Dr. Frankenstein, like out of nowhere, he's walking in a graveyard.  Maybe someone could explain this.  And there's a guy just hanging.  And Igor goes up and cuts him down.  And they want the guy's brain.  But Dr. Frankenstein goes, we can't use his brain because he broke his neck. 
[00:49:30]  And I'm thinking to myself, how does that affect the brain?  How does that actually affect the brain?  So then Igor might have cut off blood circulation to it.  And it started to rot.  I don't know.  Maybe that was it.  Well, because then they go into like some science lab.  And then they get a perfect brain from a jar.  But then.  Sitting in a jar?  Yeah.  So I'm thinking to myself, why is that brain in a jar better than the fresh brain?  Because the guy just hung himself.  You know, but they can't use that one because he broke his neck. 
[00:50:00]  And then stupid Igor freaking drops the jar.  Yeah.  We all remember that.  And he doesn't want to get in trouble with Dr. Frankenstein.  So then he takes the jar that has the abnormal brain.  Yeah.  We all know how that ended.  Yeah.  And then they show Frankenstein later in the movie.  I was just kind of taking a peek as I'm just laying around yesterday.  On that Karloff?  Yes.  These stupid movies, though, they play five minutes.  You think we play a lot of commercials?  They play five minutes of the movie.  And then another commercial break.  It's like, how long is this movie going to take all day? 
[00:50:30]  Well, the movies probably weren't that long back then as far as that.  They weren't like an hour and 15 minutes actually of film, I don't think, probably.  So they took hours.  And that's the end of the movie because I was in and they would take so many commercial breaks.  I'm like, fuck, that I know.  And they just don't care.  It's not that channel.  It's any channel.  It's impossible to watch a movie on regular commercial television.  Yeah.  Because they don't seem to know where to put commercials anymore.  They used to kind of know where a spot was, a fade between two scenes, and they would go.  Now in the middle of dialogue. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  You mean we're going to have to go to the.  We'll be back.  It's just gone.  What happened?  And they come back and it's, you know a scene's been cut out.  Well, they figure people have cable or DVDs.  Yeah.  Who the hell is watching it?  If you're a regular television scum, you don't deserve to see it properly.  Sometimes you get fooled, though.  You're flipping around the channels and you're like, oh, Die Hard.  All right.  I'll sit and watch Die Hard.  And then the first curse that comes around and they bleep in a frigging or.  Jam it up your flipping nose. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  TNT.  Click.  Look at those goody gumdrops.  I get hooked into watching the movies on regular TV and I'm thinking to myself, the DVD's sitting  right there.  Yeah.  You got the DVD.  I'm not going to get the commercial edits and I'm not going to get all the commercials.  Watching widescreen.  But there's something to be said about watching the movie on TV.  Why is that?  I don't know what that's all about.  What the hell is that about?  Is it just being lazy?  I don't know.  You don't want to get up and get the DVD?  No, it's not about being lazy.  It's just some other weird thing. 
[00:52:00]  I guess because we were brought up like watching TV and the whole experience of watching something  on TV with the commercials.  DVD's different.  I don't know.  You're watching a DVD.  It's just dumb.  I just bought it.  I got a DVD yesterday.  It's from a movie I went to see when I was a kid.  Did you, Jimmy?  Fatty Pig Fatty brought to you by H57.  Who do you lose weight for free at H57?  H57.com.  Sorry, I don't want to distract you, but Jesus.  Today's movie pick's sponsored by?  Holy crap.  Who do you?  In show freaking plugs. 
[00:52:30]  Did that one, Tham.  Copy of the movie I got.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's right.  I was going to say the copy of the movie I got is from an old film, which is impossible  to get.  And of course, at the horror convention with stupid Kevin, I'm like, I'll never find this.  He goes, yes, you will.  I'm like, no, I won't.  And he points to the table and goes, you have that?  The guy goes, yes.  And I've been looking for this movie for 10 years.  Wow.  And Dummy just points it out in 30 seconds.  But it's from a Canadian television.  So now I bought a DVD that I'm going to have to watch with commercial breaks in it.  I don't know how creepy that's going to be.  That's kind of cool, though.  Yeah.  I mean, you can't get this movie.  What movie is it? 
[00:53:00]  Crowhaven Farm.  Oh, yeah.  I've been looking.  What?  When I was a kid, I saw it.  Exactly.  It's from 76.  I was probably eight when I saw it.  And it struck terror in me as a boy.  So I've been obsessed with finding this movie to see how it is as an adult.  Does it hold up?  I remember there's a lady laying there and there's a big door on top of her.  They're putting rocks on her and it's probably not scary now, but I bought it and we'll see.  That's pretty cool.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, I remember asking Big Kev to get me the Star Wars Christmas special and he did. 
[00:53:30]  Came up.  Got one.  It was hysterical and all the commercials were in it, too.  So, you know, it brings you back to when the hell did that come out?  77, 78, maybe 78.  And the commercials are for all these bad games and old food commercials and leg stockings and things like that.  But it kind of it keeps you in the whole mood of what you're watching.  Legs.  And it is so bad. 
[00:54:00]  I'm so glad that's out there just to to twist it to Lucas like he cares.  Well, his cash that he's got.  Right.  But it's one of those things that he wishes was just gone.  And it's horrid.  Speaking of which, the Opie and Anthony Halloween show is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere.  It's good.  Movie.  Endless plot.  It's unbelievable, dude.  If I don't start now, if I don't start now, we're screwed.  That hysterical just doesn't stop.  No matter what it is, it's got to be someone's going to sponsor it. 
[00:54:30]  Today's meltdown sponsored by Lava Lamps.  Thank God John Minnelli's here.  He's going to be taking care of a lot of this crap.  Taking care of business.  There's just too much going on with these plugs.  Anyway, we got the Megamix by Funk Soul.  What's his name?  Funk Soul Brother?  Funk Soul Brother?  This is the Paul R. Nelson Megamix from Funk Soul Brother.  And what is this?  A listener?  I don't know.  I think it's a listener.  A listener put something together?  Okay. 
[00:55:00]  I just like understanding what this is.  Because you never know.  It could be a political ad.  Danny said we'll get a chuckle out of this.  Uh-oh.  All right.  He set himself up.  He didn't even say somebody gave this to him.  This chuckle is sponsored by Chuckles Comedy Hut.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now. 
[00:55:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  About now.  About now.  About now.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Thank God almighty.  Paul R. Nelson.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have to inform you that 
[00:56:00]  Paul R. Nelson has been shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.  Paul R. Nelson is dead.  Paul R. Nelson, tear down that wall.  Right about now.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:56:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  That is better than a chuckle. 
[00:57:00]  I like it.  That is really good, man.  It's catchy.  It's very catchy.  Yeah, but they just keep saying the guy's name.  It's Funk Soul Brother.  It's all you need.  The Paul R. Nelson mega mix.  It's the Funk Soul Brother song with Paul R. Nelson's name in it.  That's all you need.  Over at XM, we went off on Paul R. Nelson for about an hour and a half.  Oh, we were ready to leave.  About an hour and a half.  We were ready to leave.  And we went off, and it just went on and on.  Paul R. Nelson.  All right.  We got, well, we got the anti-Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:57:30]  Let's hear it.  Ad's coming in.  We just heard the first one from Ron Kind.  Yeah, he really wussied out on that one.  Ron Kind, Ron Kind, the Ron Kind.  Ron Kind, just saying that the mudslinging thing ain't the way to go.  Well, no.  Now he's like, okay, I got to play.  Now he's got to start slinging some himself.  Yeah.  Court security measures mean more restrictions for everyone, but a local Republican who's  running for Congress has a controversial plan, profiling, that includes extra screening.  Oh, this is actually a news story.  Oh, okay.  So it's not Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:58:00]  No, the news is getting involved.  I guess, because everyone is talking about this Ron Kind versus Paul R. Nelson thing in  Wisconsin.  Very dirty.  And now the news is like digging into Paul R. Nelson because he's accusing Ron Kind of  some horrific things.  Certainly is.  So this is the news going after Paul R. Nelson.  All right.  And profiling that includes extra screening for every Muslim man trying to get on a plane.  Joanne Lamorris, live in the news from With Story.  Joanne?  Well, Paul Nelson is making no apologies for his campaign platform. 
[00:58:30]  The Western Wisconsin Republican says with the war on terror, targeting Muslim men for  searches is all in the name of liberty and freedom.  It's so quiet in Woodville, Wisconsin, you can actually hear the time change.  But tucks into the old railroad hotel, the new buzz of controversial Republican congressional  candidate Paul Nelson.  We have become so racially sensitive in this country.  Nelson is not afraid to speak his mind.  And on his mind, Muslim terrorists. 
[00:59:00]  We are going to attempt to screen 17 to 40 year old males who are Muslim because that is  the demographic profile of the terrorists.  Who are we at war with?  Are we at war with the Norwegian ski team, the Scandinavian Luthers?  We're at war with Muslim extremists.  How do you not like that guy?  Well, we now have to vote for Paul Nelson.  Paul Nelson has a point.  Just the way the news painted it, it's like it's this outrageous thing.  How could he think that that's the case? 
[00:59:30]  Just because all evidence points to it.  Yeah, God forbid.  I hate to hear Paul R. Nelson make sense.  Paul R. Nelson can't say his S's, but man, he makes some good points.  I hate what he said, racially sensitive.  Racially sensitive.  I was at Paul R. Nelson.  Muslim.  Muslims.  There was two S's in sensitive, Paul.  You got to stick to the one S words.  Sensitive.  His big platform is against the Muslims.  He must have looked at that word and went, oh boy, two S's. 
[01:00:00]  Muslims.  Muslims, I got to say Muslims.  Muslims.  Well, he wants to profile them.  That's what everybody's been saying.  Well, a Muslim woman doesn't agree.  It's mind boggling how you could convict an entire group of individuals based on the evil acts of some.  Shlomo Mahmoud says not only is it offensive, it's ineffective.  Who is and who is not Muslim? 
[01:00:30]  A third of our folk are as Caucasian as he is.  Nelson's potential constituents are also speaking out.  I think it's becoming a necessary thing in our terrorist society.  I would disagree with that.  I don't see any reason for them to be searched any more than anybody else.  Of course, you don't.  No reason, huh?  We have our wall of shame here.  Tonight, some Nelson critics feel one more face may belong on a wall of shame.  His political campaign is based on hatred for another group of people.  And I find that very sad.  Do you really? 
[01:01:00]  Well, you know what I find sad?  The fact that planes were flown into a building and a couple of those guys were stopped.  And they didn't detain them long enough probably because, you know, they're afraid of being sensitive.  Don't want to make it seem like we're profiling.  Yeah, let's search the old lady.  Let's search the mother and her three kids.  Because there might be some Chechnyan rebel that is very light and pale that was sent over.  Shut up.  Shut your mouth.  We know who's doing it.  Yes.  We know it.  Look.  I don't say you hate Muslims. 
[01:01:30]  If you're looking for mafia guys, you don't go looking at old Chinese ladies.  Jesus.  If you want to find bludger crips, you look for young black males.  You don't search Korean women.  Exactly.  God, why is that so difficult?  You're looking for Latin kings?  What do you look for?  Spanish guys.  You look for Latin guys or women.  It's common sense.  We missed the obvious, though.  Richard from New Jersey.  Hi, Rich.  What terrorists are effing with Wisconsin?  Exactly.  Yeah, another thing.  Why is that even an issue?  And then he writes, do they even have Muslims there? 
[01:02:00]  And the answer is, I don't know.  I'm Osama bin Laden.  Cheesehead veils.  Right.  They got the big cheesehead with a veil over the front.  They got the rag on their head up high and then they have to put the cheesehead hat over that.  Over that.  Just look right back to us.  Goat's cheese.  The cheese of the uncut.  I can't wait for the photoshops now. 
[01:02:30]  Muslim with the rag.  Cheesehead.  Whatever the hell that thing's called.  And then the cheesehead over that.  I just call it a veil.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Jersey.  No, Kevin.  No offense, but we moved on from your topic.  Love the TV edits they do with movies.  Well, real fast, Kevin.  I made a mistake.  Go ahead.  Hey, you know, like on that Die Hard, like where he's a Mr. Yippee-Ki-Yay thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The MF where he's like, Mr. Falcon.  Yeah, it's really bad.  Yeah, we loved the Mr. Falcon one. 
[01:03:00]  We did a whole thing on XM and we dubbed it in and we had it dubbed in.  It's just really awful.  It's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, the MF word, they used Mr. Falcon.  What the hell does that mean?  Can we dig up some of our old rants about Mia Farrow or something else with MFs?  Yeah.  My Francesa.  We did the whole TV edit as far as this show goes because back in the day, you know, a  mere six, seven months ago, we were joking about how this show would never be back on  regular radio, but if it was, it would have to be cleaned up and we did the whole TV edit 
[01:03:30]  with some of our XM material.  Of course we did.  It was pretty funny.  All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll...  Mark found it.  Very quick.  Here, put that in front of me, maybe tomorrow or later today because we're packed today.  We could play a few of those clips.  Matt in North Carolina, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  Hey.  No, I just heard y'all talking about Vernon Robinson earlier and just for like the listeners  out there that, I mean, obviously the radio show, you can't see it.  Have y'all, have you guys seen these commercials that this guy's running?  Yeah, he's pretty twisted.  We got a couple examples. 
[01:04:00]  He's like shows like Mexicans like urinating on the flag and like flipping the camera off.  Yeah.  This guy is so wacko.  It's not even fucking...  Oh, oh.  Excuse me.  Sorry.  Not even funny.  Yeah.  You had to dump out of that, didn't you?  Well, let's play...  Yeah, it's okay.  We'll get into the Vernon Robinson, but you just remind me of another one.  The Sweeney, the anti-Sweeney ad.  I don't even know...  Sweeney?  I don't even know where these races are.  I think the Sweeney, because I'm reading it now, so I do know.  It's upstate New York, but we don't even care where they... 
[01:04:30]  This was crazy.  This guy was black.  I thought I hung up on this guy.  Oh, you just talk.  All right.  Yeah, we'll get into the Vernon thing in a second.  It's not in front of me at this particular moment.  Enough about the Vernon thing, Matt.  Thank you.  We'll get into Vernon Robinson, because his political ads are pretty interesting as well.  But the anti-Sweeney ad that we just heard before Showtime was hilarious.  Yeah.  About the frat party.  Yep.  Yeah, this one's really good.  And again, a real ad.  These are real ads.  We're not making these up.  I just watch them now for the entertainment value. 
[01:05:00]  I can't imagine people are actually watching these and going and making their decision.  And making a decision?  But we do as Americans.  No one can be.  That's the sad part.  We do.  You cannot watch an ad like this and make a decision.  It's just there for comment.  How many people do you think actually Google the candidates and really study them?  I use the Google.  The Google.  It's the same amount of people that actually Google stocks and really study them before they  you know how they go with it.  Yeah.  Now, usually, you know, your dopey friend goes, dude, dude, dude, oil, oil in Jamaica, dude. 
[01:05:30]  I'm telling you.  That's what it's all about.  My buddy works on Wall Street.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude, I'm telling you.  They have it.  Yeah.  You'd rather listen to your dopey friend than take that info and Google it yourself and  maybe do just two minutes of research.  It is so quick and easy to do on your computer to find out what these guys' platforms are,  what they voted for if they've been in Congress, what they stand for if it's their first time 
[01:06:00]  running.  Yeah.  You know, it's so easy instead of just looking at these negative ads and going, well,  that guy seems like a real ass, I can't vote for him.  But see, they know we're lazy as Americans in general.  And I know we're pissing off some of the people out there like, hey, man, I take it seriously  and I do all my research.  Well, the average voter doesn't.  They see like an anti-Sweeney ad and they go, well, we can't vote for Sweeney.  He's hanging out at frat parties doing keg stands.  And is he?  Who knows?  But this one's really funny.  Last winter, Congressman John Sweeney spent the weekend in Utah skiing with lobbyists. 
[01:06:30]  Lately, he's been partying closer to home.  At a Friday night, Union College frat party at one in the morning.  And then they do some play acting.  What are these guys running for?  Office in 1982?  The two of them.  Was it the Go-Go's?  Who was that last week?  Yeah, it was the Go-Go's.  And the Beastie Boys from the 80s.  The Beastie Men.  The Beastie Men.  Yeah.  It's really awful.  At one in the morning.  Listen to what they do here. 
[01:07:00]  Chicken!  Who's that older guy back there?  Woo!  Party!  That's Congressman John Sweeney.  Yeah, that's Sweeney Reno!  What's a 50-year-old man doing at a frat party anyway?  He's totally creaking me out.  This would be funny.  If it weren't so true.  No, it's still funny.  It's even funnier than it is.  Of course it is.  We deserve a congressman who fights for more than his right to party. 
[01:07:30]  You gotta fight!  For your right!  To party!  They don't need to leave the best music.  We got it.  We got it.  The guy likes to party.  It's all coming out.  Like he was really at a frat party.  I gotta know what the backstory is to that.  Exactly.  Exactly.  What's the truth to that one?  Because they couldn't...  They can't just completely fabricate something.  It's based on the minuscule fraction of the truth. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  So what really happened there that he was at one in the morning at a frat party?  Was he creeping the chicks out?  Was he really creeping out the sorority girls?  Were the guys going, who's the old guy at the frat?  Why was he there?  What, did he just show up?  Right.  In his toga?  He's on double secret probation.  Took a blue pill and showed up in a toga at the frat house?  He was there to bang Dean Wormer's wife.  Right.  What the hell is that about?  This is the greatest, greatest political season ever. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, it's really fantastic.  I don't remember so many ads last year.  Not this many, no.  No, they're all over the place now.  We're just trying to play the best ones for you guys.  Some used to shun this.  Some of the candidates really used to shun it and try to stay away from it.  But now it's become such commonplace that they don't care anymore.  It's just anything goes, any candidate.  Yeah.  Because then once the election's over, all this stuff goes away.  And they're all nice guys.  And I respect my respected colleague.  Oh, the one you called a dirtbag, womanizing, pedophile? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  That guy?  They didn't do this back in the 60s, man.  No.  You know?  No, no.  JFK.  Why would you vote for a man whose head is going to wind up all over the grassy knoll?  He can't even keep his brain in his head.  How is he going to keep your tax dollars in the country?  JFK's fingers smell like Joe DiMaggio's bat.  You make the connection.  Oh, well.  Why? 
[01:09:30]  How can I connect?  Oh, I see now.  Okay.  Oh, that is funny.  Yeah, look, Kennedy.  You know, Ted Kennedy keeps getting elected.  Why don't they?  Have there been negative campaigns against him?  Because he holds the office like a pope.  Nah.  No one could run against him.  Nah, Boston.  So you could bring up the fact that, you know, he killed a woman driving and then just left the scene.  That right there would lose you an election.  Don't even talk about Boston politics.  I'm telling you. 
[01:10:00]  I know.  They're listening.  They're listening.  Full of nepotism and corruption.  Just keep it up, guys.  Keep it up.  You're doing a great job.  Doing a great job.  Doing a great job.  Love that big dig.  Any more plates fall on people?  Do you have any more big plates, ceiling plates fall on people?  Because maybe the bolts, you could get them a little cheaper and someone could line their pockets a little easier.  Boston has something going on that we don't want to know about.  How about that mass pike that was supposed to have the tolls taken away once it was all fully paid for and it's been paid for for years?  What about that?  How about the toll takers?  Do they all have the same last name?  Or did you try to break it up a little in the nepotism that goes along with the toll takers? 
[01:10:30]  Just keep it up.  You're doing a great job.  Doing a great job.  I love mass.  There's so much corruption.  It's like the old west.  It's so much corruption, but no one seems to care.  Yeah.  But we were the bad guys up there.  We're the bad guys.  Run us out.  Yeah, all right.  The mayor that's also holding a job like the pope.  He got reelected again.  And I don't think anyone ran against him because they didn't want to be killed.  Yeah.  Just that.  Yeah, exactly.  A tongue-slinging campaign.  Hit by that big piece of fat in his mouth. 
[01:11:00]  Menino.  All right.  We love you.  Have we played Menino clips lately?  I don't think so.  We got to get a new batch of the mayor of Boston talking.  When he talks, it's just gold.  It's one of the greatest things you'll ever hear in your life.  It's gold.  He actually talks like there's a brick of gold in his mouth.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  All right.  We got to take a break.  This break sponsored by...  A break is sponsored.  Wait a minute.  ...go screwyourself.com.  Don't you love this Tycho guy?  His wife is dumping him on their first visit.  This little...  First prison visit?  Oh, she's out the door. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, Billy!  Do you think she did that?  Put one up against the window?  Hey, see this?  You ain't gonna see it again.  Goodbye.  Good day, sir.  Yeah, he's gonna have to kill a homoerotic Turkish guard to get out.  With his dopey fat little children.  Like Steve squared.  In Midnight Express, that's what that guy's business looked like.  He looked like Steve C. without his dumb beard.  My father was going to homoerotically beat a man's knuckles.  He's gonna beat the bottom of his feet.  Yes. 
[01:12:00]  All right, quick break.  And then we'll continue.  I guess the anti-Jim Webb ad is really good.  We're really focusing on this today.  Also, we got the anti-Opian Anthony political ad.  We haven't played any of them over here.  And Vernon Robinson, we got him in front of us now.  So we got a lot to do.  Paul Stanley stopping by.  Just a crazy, crazy morning for us today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Joining the Opie and Anthony XM walkover today, 
[01:12:30]  Paul Stanley from the legendary rock band Kiss.  Handing out copies of his new CD, Live to Win.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Paul Stanley stopping by in a little while from the band.  Well, according to Steve, I don't know.  Did we have Steve's audio?  I don't remember where he's from because I don't know.  I don't know.  We can take Paul Stanley from Kiss.  I don't recognize what that means. 
[01:13:00]  That's spot.  Yeah, play that.  Go.  This one, Steve.  Joining the Opie and Anthony XM walkover today,  Paul Stanley from the legendary rock band Kiss.  Handing out copies of his new CD.  Is he really from the legendary rock band Kiss?  How about just from Kiss?  We know it's a rock band, you jackass.  The legendary rock band Kiss.  How about you just say Paul Stanley stopping by?  I think we all know the name.  Because if you don't know who Paul Stanley is,  you're not going to be listening anyway.  Or even if you want to stretch it and go Paul Stanley from Kiss, 
[01:13:30]  but from the rock band Kiss.  The legendary rock band Kiss.  What is it, 1952?  The Kiss.  The Kiss.  When I do the Kiss.  Just trying to do the right Kiss.  I listen to the Kiss on the Internet.  I'm actually a huge Kiss fan, and I was trying to, you know.  Me too.  The rock band Kiss.  The legendary rock and roll combo.  Next time, that's how I'm going to do it.  All right.  Well, we're very excited to talk to Paul Stanley today.  Why don't you do the, he's doing the XM, 
[01:14:00]  not jog, not crawl, not sprint over.  Poor can't win, Steve.  No, I can't.  It's exactly what it is.  It's, yeah, park bus here.  I'm going to get T-shirts, me.  But you just over-explained it.  Like, legendary is fine.  Okay.  But rock band, it just rubs me.  It just rubs me.  Paul Stanley from the musical quartet.  Yes.  The Kiss.  You're really just giving me ideas at this point.  Of course.  Now they're all just going to be wise-ass.  All right, you fuzzy guy.  All right. 
[01:14:30]  Do we go with the Bush?  Do we go with the mancations?  Do we go back to the political ads?  We're trying to get away from the anti-political ads,  but we just heard one that's terrific.  Yeah, we were completely going to change gears,  but there's one that, it's got to be played.  All right.  We've got to get to mancations before we get out of here, though.  Of course.  And then stupid Bush talking about the Google  and what he does with the Google.  The Google.  Oh, my God.  You're running the world.  And calling it the internets.  Right.  Why don't you just take a quick course on the internets?  So you seem more informed. 
[01:15:00]  Like you know what's going on in this century.  All right.  Another anti-political ad.  I know we're doing a lot on this today,  but we can't help ourselves.  Listen to this one.  A national sex scandal.  Washington, 2006?  No.  Tailhook, 91.  83 women assaulted.  Jim Webb?  He called the scandal a witch hunt and a feminist's plot.  The same Jim Webb who declared the Naval Academy a horny woman's dream 
[01:15:30]  and women psychologically unfit for combat.  Jim Webb.  Right for 06.  1806.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee is responsible for the content of this ad.  1806.  It went with 1906.  It was pretty tough for the women in 1906.  I don't think it was much easier then than 1906.  Why'd you go 1806?  1806.  He could have been signing all kinds of documents.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  1806. 
[01:16:00]  1806.  We're popular here.  Like you said, who is that soldier?  Put him up by one foot on a block and make him spin in a circle.  I want to see his leg muscles.  It's a what?  It's a horny woman's dream.  Yeah, the Naval Academy.  How great is that?  Jim Webb rules.  This is him at the frat party?  Is that an actual frat party picture?  Going backwards.  We got pictures of Sweeney at the frat party.  Hey, Sweeney.  What are you doing?  His son went to the college or something like that, and he probably went, hey, come on in 
[01:16:30]  it, Dad, and he probably went to pick his son up or something like that, and he stopped  in to say hello to all the students and take a picture because he's a politician.  They were nice to him.  Maybe he did go there to just, you know, bang some horny girl.  He looks a little toasted, but it could just be the picture.  The kid, one of the kids that's taking the picture with him is holding a bottle of Gatorade,  but who knows, that might be some kind of, you know, punch in there, but he's also putting  his two fingers up to his lips like he's almost mock-smoking a roach. 
[01:17:00]  Who?  The kid right here?  It's not all the same picture.  Oh, it's not?  Oh, there are different pictures?  All right, and shift.  Pass.  Don't open.  You're giving me one.  I'm giving you one, and it has none.  Why don't you take that one?  I got this one.  I got it.  This guy's doing the devil horns in front of Sweeney.  That's great.  All right, he looks pretty, he looks pretty toasted.  Yeah.  Wow, does he look toasted.  All right.  Here he is.  He's got the hat on with the two beers in it, and he's vomiting into the toilet. 
[01:17:30]  Trousers around his ankles.  All right, very good.  He's a good boy.  Well, he is at the frat party.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's some terrific, terrific shots.  I don't know what it means, why he was there or anything, but was indeed there.  Oh, he's got a Yankee hat on.  He looks loaded.  He looks toasted.  He looks like Tracy Morgan.  All right.  Should we do mancations or bush?  What do you want to do?  I think bush.  Oh, the taser audio is not working. 
[01:18:00]  No, we got taser?  Yeah, we got the laser.  New taser?  We love when the taser clips come in.  Here, just check on that.  All right.  Mancations?  Did you say it or bush?  I didn't hear you.  Let me hear a little of this taser.  I like this one.  Okay, okay, okay, okay.  It's him being tasered.  No, no, no.  It's him.  Okay.  I love taser audio when it's not me. 
[01:18:30]  I said pictures instead of pictures?  All right.  What can I tell you?  Mancations or bush?  I like the bush thing.  You like the bush thing?  That was a big story.  Over the weekend?  Over the weekend.  All right.  This is just...  Oh, I don't want to poke fun, though.  Oh.  It's mean-spirited.  Oh, no.  I'm starting to think...  Why?  The older generation just doesn't know what's going on with the internet.  Well, who brought that up?  Did Dan bring it up?  Who brought it up?  You did?  The separation of the generations? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with the internet.  I just assume that old people know what the internet's all about.  No, they don't.  There is definitely the dividing line between the older generation and the newer generation  is computers.  Older generation, not a clue.  They might use them.  They might use them for stuff, the email, things like that, but they really don't know  how they work, what they do.  They use one billionth of a percent of its capacity. 
[01:19:30]  And then there are older people that just...  Like my mother?  Not a clue.  And we've tried a hundred times to buy her stuff, buy her the easiest computer thing.  Remember web TV?  Even tried that.  Look, it's on your goddamn TV, just so we can send you an email or a picture or something.  I don't know.  Ooh, I don't know.  They're afraid.  They're afraid.  They're afraid.  It's overwhelming when you look at the technology.  Because when I was in high school in 86, they were just starting to do like DOS prompt  and all that crap and teach you like that computer lingo. 
[01:20:00]  I don't write into that.  It was like I needed to know how this worked and everything.  But you had a young brain.  Right.  You could soak all that in.  In the old days.  My mother would rather...  I tell her all the time, Internet Movie Database, because my mother's like a movie nut, loves  movies.  I go, you just punch in any actor movie you could cross-reference, find out when it was  made by who this, that.  She goes, no.  I have my Leonard Maltin book. 
[01:20:30]  Every year.  She gets this book.  It's two feet tall.  My mom gets that book, too.  It's huge.  And she thumbs through it and goes, what an actor movie?  It takes her a week to find like what she's looking for.  I have my Leonard Maltin book.  Well, that's terrific.  In two seconds, you could have the answer to what you want.  Leonard Maltin is a creep.  What an ass.  No one likes him.  His big, thick, stupid book.  Exactly.  I'm going to knock her unconscious with that thing one day.  Get a computer, Mom.  It's great to get a confession in a South Carolina police station with her.  Right. 
[01:21:00]  Feet your wife around the body with it so the bruises don't show.  The old head of Nussbaum is straight in her outer.  That's what we also call the Leonard Maltin book.  I'm Leonard Maltin.  I'm Leonard Maltin, and I approve this book.  Another repugnant name.  Well, Bush, this is some scary stuff.  You really think the president would know a little bit more about the Internet.  Now, the president, being an older guy, should be taught this.  Someone should sit him down and smack him in the face and say, look, this is technology of the day. 
[01:21:30]  You need to know this to run this country.  Right.  You need to have a working knowledge of computers and the Internet in order to really represent the people of this country.  Apparently, he doesn't.  He can handle the power, Zoff, but when it comes to the power of the Internet.  I hear there's rumors on the Internets.  Not once, but at least twice.  Wait a minute.  Dude.  I got to say, I think he was being silly there. 
[01:22:00]  No, he wasn't.  No, I don't think so.  Then listen to him be silly two or three times.  But the Internet's.  No, why?  The Internet's.  Because he paused like, uh-oh, how do you say this word?  The Internet's.  He's thinking, because he has no concept between the Internet and websites.  So he's thinking the Internets are different sites that you go to.  You know, hey, I'm looking at a few websites here to try to find the answer.  He's thinking the Internets are, each website is an Internet. 
[01:22:30]  And he doesn't really know how to joke.  He doesn't know.  Even when he is joking, it's just so awkward.  But he said it a few times, too.  Internet.  Oh, sorry.  It would be almost like if he paused and said, uh, nuclear.  Or nuclear, whatever the word is.  Nuclear, because he can't say that right.  Nuclear, like, like.  Well, I thought it sounded like he was doing a ton cheat, but maybe I'm wrong.  No, he really doesn't have a clue.  He can handle a power, Zoff.  And when it comes to the power of the Internet.  I hear there's rumors on the Internets. 
[01:23:00]  Not once, but at least twice, President Bush has inexplicably added an S.  We can have filters on Internets.  Leading young whippersnappers to mock him.  Everyone's on the Internets.  Yeah.  That's our fearless leader.  Now the leader dubbed Googler-in-chief by the Wall Street Journal has struck again.  During a CNBC interview, the president was asked if he ever Googles.  It's occasionally, and one of the things I've used on the Google is to pull up maps. 
[01:23:30]  On the Google, I pull up the maps on the Google.  On the Google.  Here's a guy, he's the president of the United States.  He has Pentagon satellites at his disposal for maps.  And anything he wants, I pull it up on the Google.  On the Google, on the Internet.  Search on the Internet, a search engine known as the Google.  The Google.  The Google, when I do the Google.  Sounds like a new dance.  When I'm doing the Google, it's a lot different than the Yahoo. 
[01:24:00]  I'm doing the Google, and the Google.  Speaking of the Google, today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you, better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Is that the Dish Networks?  What?  The Dish Networks.  Just wanted to.  Locked out, it's the dish.  I just wanted to squeeze that in naturally, sorry.  I got the cable.  The Google, and he's looking at dumb maps.  Yeah, because he was like, what do you use?  And you could tell, like, he had a thing on his feet there. 
[01:24:30]  It's like, maps.  They got that, don't they?  Maps are exciting to look at for about 30 seconds.  Where are you driving to that you need to Google a map?  He doesn't have to.  I think he said he likes looking at pictures of his ranch.  Ew.  So it's like, it's where I want to be.  Torque.  So it goes to Google Earth, and then I Google, and I say, I think I can see me.  I can see my house from here.  Who else does that?  Mohammed Atta was doing that.  Quite a few other people were Googling your ranch.  They were Googling quite a few places around the country. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  Your ranch in particular, they'd love to get a hold of that from an aerial view.  The Google.  Sir, they're using the Google.  I like to go to the, what's that one called?  The Cinema Skin?  I like to go to that one.  I like to go to the Nude Teens.  I use that one every so often for maps.  Maps.  Maps of Hawaii.  Maps of a young, supple body. 
[01:25:30]  I go to the Google, I take off the preference filter.  Because if you have to filter on the images, you're not going to get all the real dirty, dirty pictures.  Make sure you, when you're on the Google, go to the preferences, and then click off the filters.  And go to images, and put in nude women.  Go ahead, do it right now.  I dare you on the Google.  You'll be Googling when, go to the tub girl.  I love the tub girl.  Just Google my last name. 
[01:26:00]  Just Google my last name.  And see how many you got to go through before you get to me when you take off your filters.  Go ahead.  You're going to see the bush.  How about the horse gag?  Go to the horse gag, the bang bus.  You can go.  I mean, I went to Bush on there.  I took the preference off.  I was, I was pwned.  I was pwned.  I know, I was the pwned.  I know everything about it.  I was playing Counter-Strike, and I was the pwned. 
[01:26:30]  A little more audio.  It's a little bit the way my mom talks about technology.  It's sort of sweet.  It's kind of endearing.  She calls to tell you that she got an email.  President Bush said he uses the Google to look at satellite maps of his ranch in Crawford, Texas.  Reminds me of where I want to be sometimes.  Oh, my God.  What a liar.  You think he just looks at maps of Iraq and makes sound effects with the door clock?  He's like, look, I'm winning.  I don't see any insurgents down there. 
[01:27:00]  Look, I'm zooming in.  I don't see one insurgent on the Google.  Why would you Google your dumb ranch on a laptop when you can just go and say, look, I would like an aerial photograph taken from space?  Why would you Google a map?  Exactly.  He's got spy planes, satellites, the Pentagon.  He could look at anything.  Hey, I need a picture of my ranch.  Could you get me one at a resolution that's a little better than the Google?  But he's – you know why?  Because he's lying.  It was – she was being a skank too by trying to trip him up. 
[01:27:30]  She obviously sensed as a newswoman that he wasn't computer savvy and decided to go in for the kill and ask him a question.  Do you use Google?  Instead of him going, no, I really don't.  I've – you know, I got people.  I'm a little busy to be cruising the internets.  Well, how about, no, why would I Google when I've had access to all the information that you need to go onto the web for?  I have access to that information.  I have it.  From the people. 
[01:28:00]  I actually looked on Gary Glitter's computer itself.  I have to read transcripts.  All stuff you're reading on the internets, we made up anyway.  It's a big, grand conspiracy.  You know, that was a cruise missile.  Hit the Pentagon.  Well, I got – go to the Google.  The Google.  Wait, I'm doing the Google.  I love it.  Isn't that great?  But that's it.  He's just – he's not with it.  He really isn't.  I'm sorry.  And to be a leader in this country, in this day and age, you really got to be computer savvy. 
[01:28:30]  You know, it's really where a lot of people's ideas are being placed for you to look at.  Maybe he doesn't want to see it.  Maybe he's –  Oh, I hate that.  Damn, whack bush.  It's whack bush message board.  Yeah, you think it's on message boards?  It's called whack bush.  What the hell is that?  Look, they're bashing me.  I'm going to sign up.  I got one post.  You think it's easy running the country? 
[01:29:00]  Angry typing press.  That's me.  I've been doing the blogging.  I'm blogging.  I'm on the MySpace and the YouTube.  Just the image of him, like, fighting, like, message board wars.  Listen, you ass.  Right.  Gang.  N-I-G.  Wait a minute.  Maybe I shouldn't – backspace, backspace.  Get that off of there.  Not realizing they can look at his IP address and figure out it's him.  It just says the White House.  He's got two different names. 
[01:29:30]  He thinks he's being slick.  One is Prez1.  And one is GB2nd.  Just defending Bush, but, like, not as himself.  He's doing a great job.  Just because he says the Google doesn't mean he doesn't use the Google.  Mock him all you want.  Mock me all – you all you – edit, edit, post.  Oh, damn it.  Edit, edit.  Well, my time ran out.  I can't edit my post no more.  Now it looks like me.  That guy above was – this is me, the president. 
[01:30:00]  And the guy above me was not me.  But I won't be posting no more.  And that one pal talk photo of him just panning down his chest into his lap,  waving it at the camera because he doesn't know about screen capping.  Want to go the private?  I'll go the private with you.  All right, listen, before we take a break because we've got to get –  We've got to take the break.  Paul Stallion here.  From the kiss.  We've got the Opie and Anthony show political ads. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  They're starting to come in.  This is an anti-Anthony ad.  Oh.  Pro-Bill Barr.  I'm loved.  Anthony Cumia has a very big secret.  Do you really want your favorite radio host to be someone who aligns themselves with Nazi Germany?  Anthony Cumia admitted this himself. 
[01:31:00]  I'm into Nazis.  Mm-hmm.  Let's hear that again.  I'm into Nazis.  Mm-hmm.  And one more damning time.  I'm into Nazis.  Mm-hmm.  Paid for by the friends of Billy Burr.  What's creepy in that?  You go, I'm into Nazis, and you hear me just go, mm-hmm.  Like, just so casual.  Like, yeah, we all know.  I think they cut out the knot.  Huh?  I think he cut out when I said, I'm not into Nazis.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So it sounds like I'm into Nazis.  Now he can just use that one. 
[01:31:30]  But I said, I love the era.  Yeah.  I collect World War II memorabilia from all of the sides, both Axis and Ally.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Sure you do.  You have to.  Martini Steve is incapable of expressing emotion.  Why not?  Martini Steve has no feelings.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Time and again, Martini Steve has proven that he doesn't have what it takes to be an actor. 
[01:32:00]  James Norton has a track record of successful, long-running television series like Tough Crowd  with Colin Quinn and HBO's Lucky Moon.  James Norton has what it takes.  Please hire him.  Best paid for by MBSD Entertainment and David Steinberg.  That one's all right.  It doesn't make much sense.  I appreciate the sentiment, sir, but I have the ability to do what?  Drive everything I touch into the ground? 
[01:32:30]  I've never been on anything that lasted.  God almighty.  That one's all right.  I clip the wings off of everything that's soaring.  I crossed that one out.  It's all right.  Yeah, because there's no clips in there.  By the way, the first one was from Jared in Boston.  The one we just played was from Tom S. in Boston.  This is the best one that has come in so far.  We'll play some new ones tomorrow.  We're getting them together.  A pro-Steve, anti-Anthony from John in Hartford.  This one's really good. 
[01:33:00]  Before you head to the polls this November,  Steve C. would like you to know a few things about his opponent, Anthony Cumia.  Did you know that Anthony Cumia doesn't like black people?  In fact, he lives in one of the whitest neighborhoods in greater New York City.  And though he may be surrounded by Jews, it's a known fact that Anthony Cumia is a Nazi.  And during a recent skit on the Opie and Anthony program, Anthony played the part of Senator Mark Foley. 
[01:33:30]  Kid toucher, you decide.  Steve C. speaks with perfect enunciation and inflection.  Steve C. has never had a girlfriend placed in a loony bin.  Steve C. cares about the environment.  He drives a hybrid, not some flashy Mustang.  Steve C. cares about the environment because he lives in the environment. 
[01:34:00]  Played for by the World Wildlife Fund.  Steve Irwin treasurer.  Anthony should also go,  Steve C., no need to hide it.  We already know.  All right, with that we've got to step aside  All right, Paul Stanley coming in in a few minutes  It's the O.A. virus spreading across America  The O.P. Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the O.P. and Anthony show

Yeah, you're right, they are review proof  No one watches reviews and goes, well let's see what the critics are saying about  Yes, Saw 3  And the subplot  Last batch of Halloween tickets

What's going on? I don't know  Who the what?  I don't know  All I know is Hard Rock Cafe tomorrow night, the O.P. and Anthony Halloween party  Looking for you to dress  In a way that has something to do with the show  Show related costumes  Show related costumes, that's right  I really wanted to do something awful with my hair 
[01:36:30]  But I gotta run out, like leave the party and go do a spot or something  Just to prepare for Wednesday night  Because your hair's grown in a lot  Yeah, I really wanted to give myself that awful Chinese bulldo  That I came in that one morning  Oh wow, would that be good  That horrid hairdo  Do that and then just do your set that night  I can't, I gotta go out and do set that night  And it'd be like a prop comic where your head would be your prop  Yeah, plus if I walked into the cell like that  I think they'd decapitate me  Well they should  Alright, we're looking forward to the party tomorrow night 
[01:37:00]  It's gonna be a lot of fun  Indeed  Yeah, costumes that have something to do with the O.P. and Anthony show  Every year we get some great, great costumes  That have something to do with the show  Alright, mancations, real fast  And then we'll get Paul Stanley in here, okay  We've been on this for a while  This is the latest story on mancations  I personally don't get it  It's when a bunch of guys go away together  It's the continuing feminization of men  It's this thing, it's supposed to be a security in your masculinity 
[01:37:30]  But it really is a way to kind of feminize the men  This whole metrosexual thing  Where guys are going out and doing what the ladies are doing  Getting facials and manicures and stuff  And saying, hey, I'm still, you know, all man  I just, I'm taking care of myself  See  They give the names like this  What happened?  When you watch The Deer Hunter  Right  Is that considered a mancation?  When they all went out and almost shot Fredo in the head? 
[01:38:00]  No, but it is when they're over there being forced to play Russian roulette  That's a mancation  Now that's a mancation  Here's the idea  It's supposed to be like a bunch of boys  Just being boys  And getting away from the gals  That's where it comes from  It's not just guys going out  There has to be some female involvement  Some way they're getting away from the girls  To say, look guys  Now's our chance to just be the men  That we know we are  Totally disagree  Because our girls told us we can leave 
[01:38:30]  Totally disagree  And do something  Totally disagree  Really?  That's how it's being presented to the men out there  By the travel agents  But the reality is  It's a bunch of guys getting together  And banging prostitutes  And getting away with murder  If that's what it is  Getting away with murder  But then they do these stories  And going  No, we're just old college buddies  And decide we want to go away  And hang out  And catch up and stuff  No way  Well that's fine  If that's what it is  If it's to get away from your wife  And pay for sex 
[01:39:00]  I have no problem with it  I've taken mancations  I'm not married  We went to Brazil  Maybe not even pay  I'm sure some, yes  But maybe as innocent  As just going to strip clubs  With your old college buddies  And stuff  But to make believe  You're just hanging out  Playing golf  And having a nice dinner afterwards  And all that  Is BS  It's doing something sexual  Whether it's strip clubs  Is it?  There's something sexual involved in this  Absolutely  I didn't see it that way  I see it as these  Bunch of  Like whipped guys  That just decide 
[01:39:30]  That they have to  You know  Hey, I'm still all man  Yeah  Watch what I do  Because she told me I could  Yeah?  Yeah  Yeah  Or maybe a little bit of both  Maybe, you know  Some people are using it  For one thing  I gotta think the sex angle  Is in there somewhere  Right  Why else go anywhere?  I mean  We flew below the equator  To pay for sex  With indigenous people  And how fantastic that was  There was no language spoken  You hand over reals  So the next thing you know  You're having sex with a stranger  It's fantastic 
[01:40:00]  And their mouth also  Like mouthwash  In between tricks  They go and use like  A mouthwash to close  Any cuts in the mouth  That's always a lovely feeling  Really?  Yeah, people are  Gargling with alcohol  Just so they don't transmit anything  Or catch anything  How are they cutting their mouth?  Just like little teeny cuts  That we have as people  In our mouths from eating  Little teeny microscopic ones  Alcohol helps to close them  What do they just need  A box of Captain Crunch  With no milk?  Leave those shards of flesh  Hanging from the top of your mouth?  It's Copacabana, Brazil  I don't have a lot of cash  In Rio  There's not a lot of money there  So you can eat anything 
[01:40:30]  So you're helping the economy  So you're doing a good job  Bless you  God bless you  That would be a great gag  Just like  Eat a light bulb  Before you go into  One of those joints  There you go  Just like  The hooker eats a light bulb  Come here  Well, no  Let's see how desperate you are  So what's this man  Oh, the hill man's doing  The 2006 mancation to Greece  Oh, wow  Wow  That makes sense  Wow  You know what those Greek are into  Huh?  Yeah  What is going on in man town?  You ever ask for Greek? 
[01:41:00]  You know what you get  When you ask for Greek?  Of course  You ask for French  You get the top end  Yeah  And you ask for Greek  Well  Whoa  Yeah, you ask for Greek  And you get a girl going  I didn't post that ad  I don't do that  Oh, really?  I've said  Do you speak Greek?  No  I did  The agency posted that  How about Bearback?  No  I don't do that either  Yes, I do Greek  It smells like a gyro  They had in the paper  I think a week ago  A guy proud of his little spot in his own home 
[01:41:30]  Where he gets to just be a man  And it looked like it was like the garage that was half vanished  Or the basement that was half vanished  Big smile on his face  Right, like just a primitive bar he set up  And like, I don't know, like a Budweiser mirror  And like an old TV  He looks at it like, look at what I'm allowed to do  This is my spot  This is my home where I can be a man  And meanwhile, the reality of it is, dude, you lost your house  Right  You lost the entire house  You're now relegated to a piece of crap  A corner of a basement 
[01:42:00]  Like a kid in a tree fort  And he was all proud  That's what you got  You got yourself a tree fort  You happy?  He was all proud  Well, here's the latest on Mancations  Let's learn some more  I don't get this  I don't get this phenomenon  Where you just go away with a bunch of guys  But it's very hot these days  Jerry's dance partner was kind of hot  Yeah, we said that on Friday  Yeah, I never saw it  I never watched one minute of this show  She was from Australia or something like that  Is she?  Yeah, she was beautiful  Wow  It's a busy life 
[01:42:30]  And lots of long distance friendships for Fred McCool and his close buddies  We all work very hard  We all have family  So Fred, his friend Steve, and six other guys started the tradition  An annual golfing getaway  Golfing getaway means golf and strippers  Simple as that  Some of these guys are nerds too  I hit her between the first and second hole  But if you're in a loving relationship  Why wouldn't you want to go away with your family when you finally get vacation time? 
[01:43:00]  Why do you want to escape that unless you're not too happy with your marriage?  It's an age thing too  Nobody wants to feel like they're getting older  And this is the rest of the world  Everybody wants to recapture youth  And a lot of times youth is just associated with your friends  His name should be Fred McDouche  This guy just hangs out with his buddies and plays golf  What a zero  So you're thinking like  Yeah, he kind of remembers doing that when he was free and younger  And so now he leaves the wife at home  And the kids  Goes out with his friends  And all of a sudden they act like they're youngsters  With their corn balls 
[01:43:30]  With their fat stomachs  Remember that time?  You remember that time back, you know, when we were 20  And you did  To trade little stories  Yeah, dirty jokes  Having beers  Just awful  Maybe a strip club, you know  Innocent  Yeah  Annual golfing getaway  I've seen him once a year on this trip  Travel experts say they're booking more and more men-only trips  They're becoming so popular  They've actually spawned a name  Mancations  From golfing to bass fishing 
[01:44:00]  Sports trips to VIP and spa packages  There's something for every group of guys  Even a Porsche driving experience  Men have been going  A Porsche driving experience  Or a Porsche to get the women while you're away  Bruds  Well, some of the stuff is probably just things women don't want to do  Like the sporting stuff  Chicks want nothing to do with that  And you're tired of being on a trip  And having to hear her nag at you  And complain when you want to do what you want to do  That's part of it  So you can just hang with your friends  Because you don't have the courage to tell your wife to shut her face  And sit in the hotel  And no women involved whatsoever  I think 
[01:44:30]  I'm sure on some level it is  But like most people  You think that guy with his golf buddies  Are frequenting a strip club  Or  Maybe  Maybe they have a girl come in  And their idea of like really sexy  Is to have her put whipped cream on her own chest  And like  You know  And lick it all  Like they think that's really racy and sexy  Yeah  My idea of what  Hey  What goes on here stays here guys  Oh  Yeah but it's just nonsense  Nothing  Let's go to George in Jersey  He says I'm wrong  George  You're dead wrong  Morning boys  Hey George 
[01:45:00]  I just got back from a trip with seven guys  We went to another guy's house in Florida  You're absolutely right Opie  You go play some golf  And then you go to the kiddie bar  And maybe you go to some Indian casino  And for three or four days  You decompress  You forget about all the  Alright they dumped out of you  But basically you said  I'm wrong  But then you said  You go to the strip clubs  But you admitted  Golf strip clubs  I'm not saying that you're cheating on your wife  But there's some kind of  Female element involved in these mancations  There has to be  Like I get it 
[01:45:30]  I get spending an afternoon  With a few buddies  And maybe playing golf or something  Or going to a football game  And tailgate  And doing that whole thing  But you ever go away with  Would you ever want to go away with your friends  For a week  After an afternoon  You don't have anything left to talk about  I've done it  And again it depends on what your common interest is  We went away to be filthy in Brazil  So it was worth it  Because we would just like hang out  And go to the whorehouse  Can you imagine hanging out with Patrice  And Rich Voss  And Bob Kelly  And all those guys  For a week in Florida 
[01:46:00]  No  No  I'd like to talk to them  We're on a gig together  Guys we don't have a lot to talk about  With each other  George  You could spend an afternoon  Talking to your old pals  But after that  There's nothing else to talk about  Yeah  George  You know what happens guys  Is you stop talking  And everybody just sits in these  And it's quiet  Because you're absolutely right  You know after the first date  You catch up on all the stuff  That's going on  Then it's just sitting in a room  Where you don't have to talk to  Your wife  Or your kids  Or you know 
[01:46:30]  You don't have to talk about  This little piece  Doesn't that just kind of show  That you're not kind of  Into your wife and kids  I don't think so  It's what  It has nothing  It has nothing to do with that  Yeah  You go away on family vacations  And you have fun with your families  And that's great  But then you know  There are times  You just want to you know  Get away for three or four or five days  And now  Wouldn't you rather have the freedom  To do that maybe  Like one night  A couple of nights a week  Or something  And every so often  You hook up and play cards 
[01:47:00]  Or something  Instead of just  Making it this big  Week long thing  I can see  I can see maybe a weekend  Whatever  But when it starts stretching  In a four or five days  Like oh god  What a bore fest  It's hard for most people  Like I  We don't have kids  So we don't have to get up  Like and deal with kids  At two o'clock in the morning  So a lot of guys  Can't just have people  Over for cards  We date  Or you're on vacation  And you want to be  Parasailing and scuba diving  Doing all this crazy stuff  But you got the kids with you  Like I don't have time to do it  So I get it on a level  But when you're going  Four or five days  Nah 
[01:47:30]  Gotta be a sex element  You gotta be married  You gotta have kids  To understand  It's really  It's not a thing about  You know your wife  And kids  And not caring about them  Right  Having some down time  Keep telling yourself that  All right George  Thank you  More of the club  We gotta hurry up  Because Paul Stanley's waiting  Men have been going away  Together forever  On fishing trips  And hunting trips  And this is just becoming  A more formalized trend  Because hotels are making it  Easier than ever  And creating fun packages  With many even 
[01:48:00]  Packages  Tossing in some  Manly extras  They'll do things like  Have a nightlife concierge  Who'll hook up  All your fun activities  For the night  Or they'll create a suite  So that you have  A bucket of beer  When you get there  And do fun  Poker nights  Poker nights?  Poker  I believe it was poker  But I wonder if that  Nighttime concierge  Is kind of  You know  All right  I know what you guys  Are into  Of course  I guess  She'll be up with  A couple of her friends  Shortly  I think I'm turning a little bit  I guess I get it  A little bit more  But I don't know 
[01:48:30]  When it stretches out  To like  A whole week or something  I don't know  This just seems to me  To be this thing  You don't have permission  Most of the  Your married time  So this kind of  Now you're allowed  Look at me  I'm being the man  That I am  Oh  Gotta get home  I guarantee you  The nighttime concierge  Is a swarthy scumbag too  He probably smells like  Cheap cologne  And like he says things like  And if you gentlemen  Want a little extra  He uses like that  Concierge language  That hotel language  He won't go 
[01:49:00]  Would you like a hooker  He would say something like  And if you gentlemen  Feel like you need  A little extracurricular  Like that smug  Like business guy language  Maybe if you run out  Of things to talk about  Someone else could come up  To maybe spice up  The conversation  You know what I mean  You know what I mean  That's right here  Initial here  He puts his hand down  For his tip  Oh we get news  We get newscaster banter  As they wrap up  The story here  Fred's group is already  Planning next year's  Party vacation  Every guy 
[01:49:30]  Needs to go out  And enjoy themselves  And let loose like this  It's a lot of fun  Now all of this  Of course predicated  On whether or not  Your wife will let you  Out of the house  Mancations of course  Vary in cost  From hundreds  Of thousands  Of thousands of dollars  Depending on where you stay  What exactly you want to do  To see if a hotel offers  A specific mancation  Just check their reservation page  Under packages  And you can see  What exactly they offer  So John  What's your mancation brand?  I did a mancation  Golfing mancation  You know what  Good about a mancation  You could be completely stupid  Come on 
[01:50:00]  That went away to an island  Oh  Okay  That was getting better  Shared a room  Any of those  Nightlight packages  Island of Pomo  I don't know about the room  It wasn't a package  But we split the dinner bills  Which was good too  That's better  But the mancation  Was I think  Just we called ourselves  Dumb and Dumber  On this vacation  Which is completely stupid  Did it sound like a lot of fun  Did it sound like a lot of fun  You and your friend  Hold up at a motel  Playing golf  Calling each other  Dumb and Dumber  Yeah  Aren't we dumb 
[01:50:30]  Teehee  Awful vacation that was  A lot of people say  Look  Love my wife and kids  Just want to get the F away  From them every once in a while  You know what  I will just admit that  I don't know anything about this  We don't have the wife  We don't have the kids  So it just seems weird to us  But  He goes on mancation  Right  That'll be used in political ads  Maybe it makes sense  Maybe it says  I don't know  I don't know where I'm at  With this  I think some of it 
[01:51:00]  Like Jim said  The dark side  Yeah  Where you're going in  You're having the sex  Whatever  The sex  And then others  It's innocent  Stupid  Boring chit chat  Bruce from Louisiana  Wasn't Brokeback Mountain  A mancation  Yeah  That certainly was  You know  There's a guy  We don't have time  To go to the phones  Unfortunately  Maybe we can bring this up  Again tomorrow  Because you know  There's a guy  Who wants to talk about  How he's going on  A motorcycle run  With 12 guys  You know  Hunting trips every day  You know  Four day hunting trips 
[01:51:30]  So  I guess it's fair to say  We don't know  Because we don't have  The wife and the kids  So  Why don't we take a break  And get Paul Stanley in here  Make sure to be on the internet  Alright  It's the only virus  Spreading across America  When we get back  Paul Stanley  Jim Norton  Will be appearing  On The Late Show  With David Letterman  Wednesday, November 1st  Check local listings  For showtimes  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The Opie and Anthony virus  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:52:00]  The ONA virus  Spreading across America  Live to win  I like it  I mean we only heard  What  Ten seconds of it so far  But that's the latest  From Paul Stanley  Who's sitting in our studio 
[01:52:30]  Right now  Live to win  Off the CD  Live to win  Of course  I just came in  From my mancation  I know  I'm sorry  Mancation  Mancation  How pathetic  He's sitting there  Drinking his coffee  Whatever in the green room  And waiting  And waiting  And we decided  To go with mancations  Instead of Paul Stanley  So now I'm embarrassed  If it was great radio  Then you maybe would understand  Who would want to go away  With a bunch of guys  And act like you're in high school  Isn't that what you did  For many years  Yeah  I was fresh out of high school  It's called your career 
[01:53:00]  I was fresh out of high school  They want to just make believe  They're a rock star too  Talking about  Because we were talking  During the commercial break  And stuff  And it sounds like  There was a little  Mancationing going on  Early in the  In the early days of Kiss  Yeah  Yeah  But a time and place  For everything  You know  Yeah  There's nothing more pathetic  Than seeing a bunch of old guys  Leaving their old wives behind  I don't know  Going out to be guys again  Yeah  Can I have my junk back  Please  Could you take it out of your purse  And I could slap it back on  And be a man for a week  Jesus  Jesus 
[01:53:30]  It's kind of weird  It's funny when rock stars  Look at regular people  Like what a bunch of nerds you are  Got to go away and play golf  Because all these guys do  I mean you know  Is like just  You just basically kick chicks off  That's got to be the fun part  Of being in a band like that  Is like you just fight over  Alright well you banged that one  But I had that one yesterday  And I'll take this one now  When you finally settle down  Hopefully it's not somebody  You want to get away from  Jesus  You know  That's sort of what I was getting at  But yeah  But again  This is for like regular guys  When you're Paul Stanley  When you've like  Looked through the filing cabinet  And you've gone through  4,500 different things 
[01:54:00]  You're like alright  I'm in love with this person now  Most guys might have a few  Like you know  Five or six  Like that gal from college was nice  But you know  When you're in Kiss  And you're the front man  From Kiss Man  You've gone through  Quite a few different options  I'm sure  Yeah  It doesn't suck  There must have just been  A frenzy  It's been  Back in the  You know  It's been everything  That people think  And then more  And more  I mean it's more  Than I could have ever imagined  You told us all the good stuff  During the commercial  So now we got to make believe  We didn't hear any of that stuff  Yeah he had some good stuff  Talking about Ace Freely  Because I'm a big fan 
[01:54:30]  I met the band one time  I got a photo with the band  It was Peter Gene Paul  And it was Tommy  In Ace's makeup  Who looks just like Ace on stage  And Ace I'm like obsessed  With meeting now  Because I have not  He's the one guy in the band  I haven't met  Ace is a great guy  He didn't make it to my show  Saturday night  But he's  You know  I give him a lot of credit  He's been fighting to stay  Clean and sober  And he's doing a great job of it  And takes it real seriously  And he's one of those people  Who used to believe  That he was a victim  Of everybody else's injustices 
[01:55:00]  And once he got his head on straight  He realized  You know  He said to me  How'd you ever put up with me before  And he's a great guy  And I like him more now than ever  Do you think that  Like him or Peter  Like when they were out of the band  Like a few years later  Look back and went  I am not in Kiss anymore  Like what an idiot I am  Like why would you leave that  Or why would you do it  Cause you to get thrown out of that band  I think you know  I think there were other  You know circumstances  When you start mixing chemicals  And everything else  And I don't think anybody's  Thinking straight  No matter how much 
[01:55:30]  You know  They might think so  I mean  Here's guys who won the lottery twice  They came back into the band again  And unfortunately  Found the same exit door  That's gotta be a hell of a moment  Of clarity though  When your moment of clarity is  Oh my god wait  I was in Kiss  You know  It's not just like  Oh damn I lost my car  Or something  It's like wait  Was I in Kiss  What happened  I lost that job at the garage  It's the door closes behind you  And it doesn't open again  You know  Or you call people's bluff 
[01:56:00]  And everybody says  There's the door  So when they came back  I remember  I think it was during  An MTV Unplugged thing  It was a huge moment  That Peter and Ace  Came back out  And you guys played together  How long did it take  Say when you decided  To tour again  For like the  For the honeymoon  To be over again  Like oh we still have  Some kind of problems here  You know  It's like  You ever have like  An ex-girlfriend  That you go  You know  Why did I break up  With her  She was kind of  You know  She was hot  Good looking  And then you go  Back with her  And on the first date  You go  Now I remember  That's the beauty  Of being me  I kill them  So it's kind of like 
[01:56:30]  The time to find out  You don't want to be  With your ex  Is not when you're in bed  With them  You know  But look  We had a great  Second run  Made a whole lot  Of money  Made a lot  Of people happy  And but unfortunately  You know  Some certain  You know  Individuals have problems  That just kept  Coming up  And you know  By the end  Of the farewell tour  I kind of realized  That I didn't want  To say farewell  To the fans  I wanted to say  Farewell to some  Of the guys  In the band  I didn't want  To stop the band  You know  So we're still around 
[01:57:00]  Doing solo stuff  Do you find  That you want  To do stuff  That you couldn't  Do in Kiss  Like you got  A solo album  Matt  Are you saying  To yourself  Like alright  Well this is  Something that  They probably  Would have wanted  To change directions  In but I would  Want to do  So you do  Your own thing  Or is it just  Kind of like  Working with  The other three  Guys anyway  Well when you do  A solo album  It's different  Because when you  Do a band album  Then I'm writing  For the strengths  And weaknesses  Of the guys  Who are playing  You know  When I do a solo album  I get to write  What I want  And then bring  In the people  Who fit the song  So but in terms  Of playing live  They're all my 
[01:57:30]  Songs anyway  You know it's  Kind of like  All my unruly  Kids get to  Come out with me  So you know  I mean whether  It's Love Gun  Or Detroit Rock City  Or I Want You  Or any of those  Songs they're mine  So you know  I get to play those  I get to play  Stuff from my  First solo album  Stuff from  Live to Win  And it's been  Awesome  Yeah that's what  Surprised me  This is only your  Second solo album  After all these years  Yeah 28 years later  I said if I wait  Another 28 years  The next one will be  Called Hope to Live  But seriously folks  Try the veal  Yeah  I was surprised though 
[01:58:00]  You would think  You would have  You know maybe  Had a few more  Solo albums out there  I mean it's no secret  Some of the other guys  In the band  Are always running off  And doing other things  And I just had this  Feeling that if we  All run off  There won't be a band  To come back to  So I kind of  Became like the  I felt like the  Caretaker  Kind of like  Keeping things afloat  And finally I reached  A point where I just  Thought everything's  Pretty steady  And solid  It'd kiss  So let me go off  And do what I need  To do  And when the front man  Kind of goes off  And does his own thing  It really conjures up 
[01:58:30]  Especially the rumor mill  Gets going like  Oh boy it's gotta be over  Nah you know I think  That the stronger  Each member is  The stronger the band is  So I'm just trying  To make myself happy  I mean it's great  To go out  I mean it goes back  To the reasons  I started playing  In the first place  It was just music  I mean there's no  Bombs  There's no pyro  It's just me on stage  With a great band  And to me it's more  Like the days when  I used to go to  The Fillmore and see  You know Humble Pie  Zeppelin  Derek and the Dominoes 
[01:59:00]  You know a bunch of  Guys with amplifiers  And guitars  Just preaching rock and roll  Do you look back  On your stuff  Like when  Everyone has like  Those moments  You look back  On your thing  Like I wish this was better  Is there anything  You look back on  Like musically  Like one song  You'll hear and you go  Why did we do that  Like that  Like that you wish  You could fix  That you just look back  On and cringe  You know I mean  There's some songs  That I'm not crazy about  There's a couple albums  That I'm not crazy about  But when we were doing them  They were the best  We could do at that time  So you know  Everything I did  Got me here 
[01:59:30]  So the good  The bad  The ugly  You know  That's why I'm sitting here  Hey Jimmy  Can you tell your kiss story  It's really embarrassing  Paul is  And I'll be very honest  I'm a Sabbath freak  An Aussie freak  And a kiss freak  But kiss was my first  Long before Sabbath  It was kiss  I'd say Paul Stanley  Was probably my first idol  As a kid growing up  And I finally got to meet the band  It was  My friend Wendy  Is close with Gene  And it was  It was the dumbest luck  Of the garden  And I got a photo  With the band  And it's just  It's really embarrassing  I'm going to look at them 
[02:00:00]  And I was  I was so  It was very childhood  A childhood of me  I got to stand in front of Paul  For the band  And there was like  Three of us  Four of us  And the band's behind us  And Paul  What he does for the photo  Is he puts his arm  On your shoulder  Like from behind  Because you have the heels on  So you're much taller  And I was such a douche  I took my head  And I tilted it to the right  And it touched his arm  And I almost like held his  But it wasn't like a gay thing  I probably  I know it sounds like it is  Because like  You know  On mancations  I really should 
[02:00:30]  I should go on  On to Rikers Island  With my hands  Gripping my ankles  After this story  But it was like  It was like  I was like  I felt like a little kid  And then I'm like  What are you doing  And I look at  I have the picture here  Of course I love it  Side  If you don't want to  Rip it up and throw it  In my fat face  Oh it's just horrid  I'll show it to you  Yeah you gotta show him  Because  He kind of downplayed  What he's doing  He's holding on  Almost like a kid would  With his father  On a line  At a ride  At an amusement park  If this doesn't make you  Want to throw up  See if people on  Paltalk can see it 
[02:01:00]  They can't  Because Paltalk's off  Right now  We'll be on over there  Oh that camera works  Okay  I get it  I get it  The cool thing about Kiss  Is it brings everybody back  To a special time  In their lives  I mean  When you hear Kiss  When you hear certain songs  You remember  Who you were sleeping with  Where you were eating food  You know  You remember like  Those moments in your life  And they sometimes  Meeting the band  Can reduce you to that  That childlike state 
[02:01:30]  What a nice guy he is  What he should have said  Was Jim you're a douche  But he just gave  The nicest explanation  And Jim that's not the story  I was thinking about  You're telling the easier  Of the two stories  Oh the cute one  When you were a real little kid  Your dreams  Your dreams  With Helen  Oh when I was  Well again  Okay this is  This is probably even  This is probably  This is creepy  You might want to leave  After you hear this story  I was born in 68  So I'd have to say  This is 76  Probably I was like  Eight years old  Probably right around  Destroyer time  I had an imaginary 
[02:02:00]  Play friend  Who was named Helen  She was a middle aged  Woman with a beehive hairdo  I don't know what  Happened to me  There's one neighbor  Out there with photographs  Chick  Yeah  Yeah he says it's so casual  Yes he had an imaginary  Friend named Helen  With a beehive hairdo  But my fantasy  When I was a kid  I know it sounds crazy  And it wasn't  Again it wasn't perverted  It was just an odd fantasy  I would have  Is that Kiss  Would show up to my apartment  With their makeup  And costumes  And beat me up  And hurt me  And throw me down the stairs  And then when I was sad 
[02:02:30]  They would just hug me  And make me feel better  When you were sad  From being thrown down the stairs  Of course  As you would be  When your four heroes  Showed up and threw you  Down the stairs  And beat you  But then after that  Shortly after that  Was it right after you fell  They hug you and make you feel better  Yeah  They would come down  And hug you and make you feel better  Folks we have all kinds of fans  Another great answer  See  Hey all kinds of fans  I understand  He understands Jimmy  Wow  And I do  I tell those stories  I'm a comic  So I tell those stories on stage 
[02:03:00]  I talk about it now  But when I realized  What I had done in that photo  And again  I don't want it to come off  Like it's a homoerotic thing  Because I can't even look at it  It's like really douche  Yeah I bet  But you look back on it  And you're like  What's the matter with me  I'm a 30 year old man  You know the funny thing  I swear to you  I think when we went out  On the Grammys  Before we went out  On the reunion tour  We surprised everybody  By walking out  And giving one of the awards  And we'd been gone  For like 17 years  And we came  The four of us walked out  And I never saw  So many bands 
[02:03:30]  In an audience  Turn six years old  I mean  Wow  Everybody's eyes got big  And you know  These guys from these  Very serious bands  Suddenly were  You know  They were kids again  Yeah  Yeah  Something about kids  That's eternal  And timeless  And you know  As long as we can  Flap on that makeup  And not eat too much  We pretty much  Looked the same  Well my dad took me  To see you guys  In a  I want to say  You were working  With Cheap Trick  I don't remember  If they ever opened  For you  Yeah Cheap Trick  We took them  Out of the clubs  And took them  On their first tour  Was that the first concert 
[02:04:00]  Your father took you to  Or what was the first  Yeah  Yeah  I remember  There might have been  Another show  Before that  I don't remember  Any other concert  My father might have  Taken me to  Oh come on  Do tell  Yeah which one was that  Well there was  Was Helen with you  You and your dad  And Helen  You bought three seats  Just in case you showed up  Well it was  It was  The infamous  Village People  Sister Sledge tour  Village People  I missed  I missed that one  Yeah it was  It was really good  Probably because you were  You know with girls  That's why you missed it  I don't know  What's the matter with me 
[02:04:30]  With his dad  Village People  Village People  They must have thought  We were some kind of  A weird like Chelsea couple  I don't know why  He would take me to that  Because I liked  We are family  But I mean I think  I kind of like  The Village People  I think Felipe Rose  Was my favorite  The Indian  I always thought  He was the coolest  Of the Village People  If I had to choose  But I don't remember  If that was before  Or after Kiss  To be honest  Yeah  But I want to say  It was December 16th  I know that  Because I actually  Bought a bus ad  Off of  That was  I think it was 1977  And it was  There were three nights  At the garden  Yes it was 
[02:05:00]  It was the final night  There you go  Final night at the garden  And my dad actually  Just got  I bought off  There was a bus ad  I bought off  Ebay  It was the Alive 2  It looked like  The Alive 2 cover  And so I went  To saw you guys  In 96  And it was amazing  How it was choreographed  The same  It was like  It was great  Brought you right back  Because it wasn't  A bunch of bitter guys  Playing you know  Just to get the money  It was like  The same show  Which was amazing  We were like determined  To make sure  That people  Got what they remembered  Not necessarily  What it actually was  Because the shows  During the 70s 
[02:05:30]  Were small  But they were bigger  Than everybody else  So what we had to do  Was multiply it  And bring back  What people  You know  What those legendary  Shows were  Which was very different  Than what actually  That's really odd  You wouldn't think that  You know  You kind of remember  Things a lot bigger  Yeah  It's like when  I don't know  If you ever go back  To like an old house  That you lived in  When you were a kid  And you go  It's so small  You know  But same thing  We had to build  Like this show  That was actually  Not the real show  But was what people  Fantasized that show to be  And then we made  Everybody go to the gym  Everybody had trainers 
[02:06:00]  I mean the worst thing  Would have been to have  You know  This band come back  And look like  You know  Meatloaf  Well that's where  The problem was  Because Ann and I  Went and saw  The comeback tour  In Boston  And we noticed  You guys are still  In great shape  With the makeup  And then we looked  At the audience  And ooh  They were trying to  Like squeeze into  Their old rock outfits  They should have  Hit the gym  Before they hit  The kids concert  A good night  Was had by all  There you go  You ain't  Trashing anybody 
[02:06:30]  Everyone enjoyed  The show  We enjoyed looking around  And seeing girls  That probably were hot  Back in the day  And trying to wear  The same exact  I was looking at  Their daughters  Yeah there you go  There you go  Well that's the beauty  Of being in the band  Is like you can  Like pass the mothers  Off to the other  Audience members  And then hit the daughters  That's gotta be  The beautiful part  Of the band  Two generations  Of banging  In the late 70's  When kids became  Much more family oriented  And more family friendly  We would have  All these moms  Bring their kids  And you know  We'd be on stage 
[02:07:00]  And you'd see  Like this hot mom  With like a 7 year old  And you'd go  You know  C-Day  Row 13  You know  You tell your guy  And lo and behold  You know  Mom would bring  Little Jimmy backstage  After the show  And you'd send him  For autographs  And say hi to mom  And she'd earn  The signatures  How great is that  How fantastic  The amazing thing  About Kiss  Is that you were  So like probably  The best photograph  Band ever  Like you guys  So understood  What work  Whether it was  The chopper poster 
[02:07:30]  Series  Or the  I mean what a  Brilliant idea  The comics  The Kiss comic books  That you had like  Your own blood  Taken out  And put it to the ink  We put blood  Into the red ink  I was just happy  They didn't want  Anything for the yellow ink  I mean  You're a god  Jim might have liked that  But it was like  Conceptually you guys  Were so great  And then you did  The four solo albums  Almost like  So everybody could  Get that off their chest  Or get it out of their systems  Without the band breaking up  This man  Either you did your homework  Or you're the true fan  Oh no  He is the ultimate  Awesome  I had no 
[02:08:00]  Questions pre-planned  The only thing  I pre-planned to ask you  Was is there anything  Because we get trashed  On message boards  And stuff  Is there anything  The fans have trashed you for  Where you're like  You're like  We're going to catch  A little crap  Where you're like  Ugh  Why do you have to bash that  Like is there one thing  That they went after you for  That really bothered you  More than anything  Like that they shouldn't  Have trashed you for  No you know  Everything's  You should see the  House that bad reviews built  I mean  Everything's  It's all good  You know  People can say  What they want  There's once in a while  Like a fan 
[02:08:30]  Will just say one thing  Like they criticized me  For this that  Okay  But then there's that one thing  He's like ugh  Why that  Why don't you get  What I'm doing there  Everything else you can trash  But that  Could you leave alone  Nah  He could just go  You know  See three  Row  Yeah it's all good  It's all good  And everything's all better again  Yeah I want to get back to that  Did you guys have just one guy  That would take care of that for you  And get the hotties backstage  In the very early days  We had something called  The chicken coop  I know it's not very  You know  Socially acceptable  To call it that  But  We would have a room 
[02:09:00]  At the end of the show  That was full  At the hotel  Of all the  The women  And we'd go back  To our hotel rooms  Take off the makeup  And all that  And you'd get a phone call  You know  Chicken coop's room  317  You know  And you'd go down  And you know  You'd pick your playmate  For the evening  Wow  How afraid of you  Were you with cameras  Because like  The thing in the 70's  Was there a photo of Kiss  Was that really Gene  With Cher  Or a photo  Which when you look back  There were actually  Some photos taken of you guys  You always deny  Yeah but  It was so funny 
[02:09:30]  Because I think that  Media didn't want to  You know  Want to kill a good thing  So  Yeah back then  They played along  Nowadays it's completely different  Because like  They talk about how  Everyone knew about  Kennedy banging broads  In the White House  But the media was like  Ah that's none of our business  Now of course  It's changed  Yeah you look back  At all these presidents  And what they were doing  And now Jesus  I mean you know  What they had for breakfast  But then  You know what was going on  With Kennedy  Or Johnson  Or any of those guys  Or Hoover  Gee yeah the mystique  Of the whole  Oh he was a naughty one  That J. Edgar 
[02:10:00]  Yeah that J. Edgar Hoover  That was one for you  Oh he was a saucy one  Him and Mark Foley  Would have had a lovely  IM chat  You know so  What figurine  Are you dressing up like  TV  And if you don't know  You don't know  What we're talking about  You can look it up  On the Google  The Google  The Google  Just put in parentheses  Clyde Tolson  And J. Edgar Hoover  And they'll probably  Come out in one  That's right  Clyde Tolson  Yeah how do you not love him  And Melvin Purvis  He had like a whole thing for  But they kind of  Melvin Purvis  G-Man  Yes  Yeah of course  And I'm so  I actually really like  The CD a lot  I don't mean actually 
[02:10:30]  Like I was surprised  But you never know  Like when somebody  That you love  Is putting something out  You always want to be good  Like it's always nervous  And I got an advanced copy  And I really dug it man  I liked it a lot  You know  Some people said to me  They expected something  That would sound like  The continuation of the  First solo album  It was 28 years later  So you know  To go in and do  A retro album  The last thing I wanted to do  Was try to pick up  Where I left off  It's a long time ago  So  But the heart and soul  Of the album is the same  I mean you know  The things that I loved  About music are all in there 
[02:11:00]  And you know  The philosophy is the same  I mean  What got me where I am  Is that  You know  Live to win  You pick your goals  You pick what you aspire to do  And you don't let anybody  Get in the way  So that way  At least if you fail  You still win  I mean if you lose  On your own terms  You're still a winner  Have you and Gene  Ever had  A little  A little discussion  About his  Maybe being a little  Overzealous  With the marketing of kids  Sure  Sure  You know  Look  We're very different people 
[02:11:30]  And as much as possible  We try to stay eye to eye  On Kiss stuff  But  You know  Sometimes things that he does  Outside of Kiss  Somehow  You know  It's kind of like the Tar Baby  It gets stuck to Kiss  When it really has nothing  To do with us  I mean  You know  I can't stop him from  Doing his  Whatever he is doing  Whatever he is  You know  And somehow  What gets tagged on  Understandably  Is Gene Simmons of Kiss  Right  But  You know  I mean  Reality TV 
[02:12:00]  I'd rather take a bullet  In the head  Yeah  I mean  But  You know  I mean  Do you  Do you  As a member of Kiss  Does it  Kind of get to you  That there's so much  Overexposure  Because of  What kind of  How many products  He's putting out  And different types  Of products  That really have nothing  To do with the  The band  It's pretty much  Just the name  And then  You know  Get the product  We put out  A lot of products  But the truth is  That we would never  Put out anything  That people don't want  You know  I mean  You'd be an idiot  To put out merchandise 
[02:12:30]  And nobody buys  So my problem  Is never with the merchandise  I just don't think  That you have to stand  On a soapbox  And tell everybody  You know  All about it  You know  Right  There's  You know  I would just prefer  Everything be out there  And people will buy it  And we're not waving  Our hands going  Look what we're selling  Gotcha  How was it doing  Phantom of the Opera  It was very cool  You know  It was another  You know  Anytime I can do something  That kind of pushes  The envelope  Is very cool  So to do eight shows  A week  In a legit  You know  Show  And I think 
[02:13:00]  It had run  Ten years in Toronto  And I did  The last six months  Eight shows a week  Standing ovations  Every show  That's great  A lot of work  Huh  Yeah  Hard man  You know  I mean  It brought a whole  Different sensibility  To you know  Bands coming in  And saying  My finger hurts  Or I hurt my toe  You know  These people go out there  And kill it every night  You know  Eight times a week  We are getting  The music is starting  Which happens on a computer  Because we're on a three hour time  And then the next show comes in  And we do the walkover for XM  So I think Paul is doing  The walkover with us  Yeah I'm hearing 
[02:13:30]  There's a nice crowd outside  And it's called Live to Win  It's your first solo album  In 28 years  I mean it's real easy  As a fan to say  I love the CD  But I did love the CD  I mean you know  It's so comfortable to say that  I probably would have lied anyway  Because I love Paul Stanley  But I do  It's a great CD  Well we'll play Live to Win  Over at XM too  When we get over there  We'll play the whole song for you Paul  Yeah I'm really happy man  Your voice is held up great  Thank you  It just kicks ass  Yeah the CD's Live to Win  The first single's Live to Win  What's that?  What does Helen think?  Helen loved it very much  But her and Jimmy Robinson  Who was kind of like Jimmy Norton 
[02:14:00]  But in a cape  And Helen  Me and Jimmy Robinson  Hated Jimmy Norton  I don't know what happened  But there's some  There's some older gentleman  With a story to tell  I'm sure  It's true too  He's been telling this story  For many many years  Also you guys are doing a signing  Are you doing a signing Paul?  Yeah  Actually Gene  Gene will hook up with me tomorrow  And we'll be signing  Kissology DVDs  And Kiss Perfume  And we'll be in the parade tomorrow  It's Verge in Times Square right?  Yeah  For the signing?  Kissology  We were just talking  Before you came in  Is it getting all this old 
[02:14:30]  Six hours of old footage  And live  Yeah  Vintage concerts  From San Francisco  Houston  Detroit  Us rehearsing without makeup  In the early days  Us playing a club  In the early days  That's cool  Very cool stuff  That's great  Better than buying a bootleg  Because the quality is there  The whole show is there  This is first generation stuff  Alright they're going to cut us off  Paul Stanley thank you  He's doing the walk over  To XM with us  If you're not joining us at XM  Have yourself a great day  You're back  Joining the Opie and Anthony XM walk over today 
[02:15:00]  Paul Stanley from the legendary rock band Kiss  Handing out copies of his new CD  Live to win  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The Opie and Anthony XM walk over begins now  We should get a little rope  So we can take care of everything  Wow we got a crowd outside  All right today  Thanks to Paul Stanley  Oh yeah  Yeah let's get it  For Paul Stanley  Come on 
[02:15:30]  Hey  I feel like I'm running for office  Man  We don't get this reaction  When we're alone  It's usually just  No  Of course not  It's the same too  Every time  All right  So do we have CDs to hand out to  Yeah we're doing Christmas early  Is that what we're doing  Signed copies of the new CD  Live to win  Live to win  Thank you  In stores now  Did it actually come out today  Or is it  It came out about a week ago  So I'm telling people  Don't download it  It's against the law  And I'm also trying to make next month's rent 
[02:16:00]  Yeah that sucks  Do you like let your shit be put on iTunes  Or do you purposely keep it off  No iTunes is cool  Because you get a royalty  Oh actually  But the whole idea of people  Talking about sharing files  That's like me saying  I'm going to share your car  I mean  I don't  All right  Jimmy wouldn't mind that at all  Well yeah  If you don't mind being in a fucking Saturn  With prostitute stuff in it  And Helen  Let's not forget Helen  And Helen  So did Helen ever disappear  Or is she still around  Oh I can't believe I'm discussing Helen  With Paul Stanley  This is very therapeutic  I don't know 
[02:16:30]  Because Jim  What happened was  It was like Helen and I  Would be there  And then Jimmy Robinson was me  But it was just me in a cape  And we would kind of all agree  That we hated Jimmy Norton  Who was him  Which was me  That you're talking to now  Yeah  But I don't know where Helen came from  She was a middle aged woman  Her hair was kind of frosted  And I would just talk to her  And kind of discuss things with her  And I really don't know  Did you ever meet Sybil?  Did you know Sybil?  No but I kind of relate  To the personality disorder  Although I think hers  Was actually just genetic  And mine was like induced  By probably an older person  Sybil to you  Must have been like a Disney villain 
[02:17:00]  This could be the day  That Jimmy admits  A lot of things on the show  No I don't have anything  Bad to admit  It was just these odd  Little things  That would go through my head  When I was a youngster  And a lot of them  Evolved around  You know  Whether it was Helen  Or Kiss  But it got you here right?  Yeah pretty much  Although I don't know  Where it here is  Yes somehow  See it did yeah  You know actually  I used to drive a cab  And I would pick people up  Around here  Are you shitting me?  No I was a yellow cab driver  Jesus  Come on  So you don't have the  Inbred hatred for it  That most people  And everything 
[02:17:30]  No I can understand it  The trouble with cab drivers  Is because  You're in a cab  And you're looking  Through a window  You think it's a video game  So you don't realize  That you can get killed  And go right through  The video game  Yeah  Oh  I hate the cab  I think I'm very powerful  Driving a cab  Yeah I was a cab driver  What is the  Is there any part about being  I mean obviously  Wherever you go  I mean people know  Where you are  Which is who you are  It's got to be  An advantage at times  What's the worst part  About being  Alright  Famous like Paul Stanley  There's nothing bad about it 
[02:18:00]  It's like  It's like winning the lottery  And complaining about taxes  You know  My life's awesome  You didn't get mad  At all those girls  Who only wanted to blow you  Because of your name  No  No  I thanked him  It made it much easier  Dude that was  That was  That's my inspiration  For even being  And I like the fact  That you and Gene  Were honest about that  In Kiss Exposed  It's like  It's about girls  Yeah what difference  Does it make  Why somebody wants  To be with you  As long as  Everybody walks away  Smiling  So you have 
[02:18:30]  I know  You had a son  I had a 7 week old son  Now  I've got a 12 year old son  And I've got a  Outrageously beautiful  And great wife  Are they musical  To all your kids  Are you actually  Your oldest one  Yeah my son plays  I mean he plays  Jimmy Page stuff  And he plays  You know  He's a great guitar player  He plays better  Than I ever did  At his age  And my son  My son wails  Just like I do  Was there anybody  Have you played with  Like that you looked at  And went wow  I can't believe  I'm actually performing  With this person  Or playing with this person  Like as your career 
[02:19:00]  Like from the  71 Wicked Lester Days  On  I haven't  I haven't really played  With that many people  Outside of the band  I mean it was cool  Having Joe Perry  Get up with us  And do Strutter  And that was  A lot of fun  But you know  For the most part  It's really just been  Kiss  And not much else  Who lasted the least  Amount of time  Having you guys  Open for them  In the old days  Because nobody  Wanted to go on  After you guys  Usually what would  Happen in the early days  Is we'd get thrown  Off the bill  Right right right  So Black Oak Arkansas 
[02:19:30]  Which was like a big band  At one point  We lasted one show  And I think we set  There curtains on fire  And we were asked  Not to come back  And then  Not too long after that  Our agent  And our record company  President said to us  What you need to do  Is you have to  Suck  You have to play less  And play worse  Because you can't  Get any gigs  Because of the volume  And did they ever  Ask you to take  The stage show down  Or not do  What you were doing  Absolutely  And we said  Get stuffed  You know 
[02:20:00]  You either take us  The way we are  Or we don't want to play  We interviewed Joe Perry  And that's when  I saw you guys  Recently at the Garden  A couple years ago  And I got that photo  Why would Aerosmith  Voluntarily go on  After you guys  Well because  You know  I love those guys  But they insisted  That they close the show  And for me  It was like  Well you got to go on  Before or after us  So you pick  You know  We're splitting everything  And if you want to  Go on last  God bless you  Wasn't there something  Where you couldn't  Go out as far  Into the audience  They had like  Little restrictions  On you guys  Like what you  Couldn't do  Well Steven had a ramp 
[02:20:30]  That he wanted  Just for him  But you know  None of that stuff matters  Right  You can't stop us  You know  I'll knock you out  With one hand tied  Behind my back  Well I watched  I watched the show  I watched a little  Of Aerosmith  And granted  I'm very biased  But it was like  What the fuck  Were they thinking  To want to follow  This show  It's just  It's like going on  After fucking  You know  Why would you  You know  Never  Pray for things  Or wish for things  Because you might get them  And I have to ask  This stupid  And I love those guys  Now is there any 
[02:21:00]  Bad blood between  Peter  We didn't talk about  Peter at all  I mean  We just mentioned Ace  Is there any possibility  Of him coming back  Or is there bad blood there  I think Peter  Is probably happy  Doing what he's doing  And I really  Truly wish him the best  Because I wouldn't  Be here without him  But it doesn't mean  I want to be with him today  Alright so you guys  Sometimes will develop  Personality things  That you look at  And you go  This is probably  Not going to get fixed  Yeah this is just not  This is just not workable  So why don't we just  Both look back  On the memories  And have a great time  And you know  Not spoil it by  You know  Slugging each other today 
[02:21:30]  How cool is it  To want to do something  And like years ago  You'd bounce off Gene  Or Peter or Ace  And now you can just go  If someone disagrees with you  You can just go  Fuck off  Get out of the band  If you don't like it  That's pretty cool  You know I mean  Democracy only goes so far  Because what it winds up  Having is a bunch of stalemates  And sometimes  You wind up  The person who  Vetoes something  Gets his way  So you know  At this point  It's like everybody's  In the same car  But somebody's got to drive  So the CD is  Live to win  And the  The Kissology comes out 
[02:22:00]  Is that out today?  Kissology is out  In the next day  I think it's out  Today or tomorrow  So that's six hours  And it's all  Vintage concert footage  And us rehearsing  Without makeup  And us playing clubs  And it's just the first volume  And it's six hours  Of awesome stuff  From our archives  And what time  Are you and Gene  Doing a signing  Because there's going to be  A fucking madhouse line  Good question  I have no idea  But  What signing  Is what time?  Around 11  Around 11  11 tonight?  No  11 tomorrow night 
[02:22:30]  And it's where?  At the Virgin  Virgin on Times Square  Alright so there's going to be  A fucking long line  For that  I probably  If we didn't have  This stupid thing to do  I'd probably just leave there  And go there myself  This stupid thing to do  I want to bail out  On our own fucking gig  So I can go  Just hang in  And really make them  Uncomfortable  And annoy them  My idea of a mancation  Is going to  Virgin Megastore  With Gene  That's the extent  Of my mancation  As far as you want to get  We're mingling with our listeners  Because we have  Two pairs of tits 
[02:23:00]  At every event  And are they yours?  Yeah  One are mine  And one is some  Retarded girl  That he's trucking  Now that you bash him  Now he needs a hug  Yeah  Jimmy needs a hug  Well this was a fine day  For me to get to  Fucking hang  With my first idol  Hug  I can't hug Paul  Hug  Hug  Give him a hug  This is the picture  Yeah  Here's the picture  Yeah  There it is  The great Paul Stanley  Nice round of applause  For Paul Stanley  And 
[02:23:30]  Oh  Are you going to give us  Some CDs  I thought you gave them out already  And live to win  Autographed CDs  From Paul Stanley  Autographed CDs  And don't sell them either  You eBay fucks  Enjoy them  You're dead  eBay fucks  That's alright  Wow  I've never seen Jimmy  More excited in my life  It was  You know something  For years  I have missed  Like  Seeing children  At Christmas  You know  I don't live that life  I don't have kids 
[02:24:00]  That was as close  As I'm going to get  To seeing one of my children  On Christmas morning  Is Jimmy  Talking  How great is this  With Paul  You are amazing  Jimmy  You're so excited  My first idol  He's out of his mind  That's his best present ever  I must say  The biggest crowd  We've had on the walkover  This is the biggest crowd  We've had so far  They love him  We've got probably  A hundred people  People brought all kinds  Of memorabilia  And stuff  To have him sign  They ambushed him  The second he walked  Out the revolving doors  To sign stuff 
[02:24:30]  And did you also notice  That the older broads  Walking down the street  And the younger chicks  They knew who Paul was  Everybody  I saw an old broad  Walk by and go  Take care man  Isn't that the guy from Kate?  And then there's the young girls  And they're  You know  Oh it's Paul Stanley  Paul Stanley  Clap for Paul Stanley  Oh is he just in love  That little fucker  Where is stupid Steve  Going with my idol  Jimmy follow him  I don't want to  My Michael cut out  Follow him  He's going into the limousine  I think Kenny's there 
[02:25:00]  To protect him from me  Oh that was fucking great  The other thing too  Really fast  Like people don't  Notice anything  On the streets of New York  They notice today  They recognize him  He's bigger than life  He walks down the sidewalk  Everyone knows who he is  Well he's got a rock star  Vibe about him  Yeah yeah  So you gotta look  That's what it is  He's got a vibe  So you look to see  Who is that  And then you know who it is  It's not like you gotta go  Who the fuck is that  I was saying  I saw old ladies  Going like  Is that the guy from Kiss?  Like they know  They grew up with him 
[02:25:30]  Well cause after the makeup  That came off  There was Lick It Up  There was like all  Heaven's On Fire  There was some like  Massive hits from these guys  So it's like  The face in all the videos  Is recognizable  Jimmy you did a great job  Oh my god  You had no idea  That you were walking  With a hundred people  It was just you and Paul  You and Paul  Walking down the sidewalk alone  Just alone with each other  You're talking to him  He's talking to you  He was very cool man  Totally  I heard he was like  Really like shy  You can meet him  Like a quiet dude  And not at all  But no he was fucking  He was fun man  And you were hilarious  We got this  I got this stupid thing 
[02:26:00]  Stupid thing tomorrow  Called Mike Lively  No I was actually thinking  Of my fucking  When I said that  I was actually thinking  Of the Letterman audition test  I was thinking  Cause I have to go out  And do like  A couple of warm up sets  Just to fucking  Get the timing down  And that's what I was thinking  Of cause I'd love to  Blow that shit off  And fucking  Hang out with Gene and Paul  Paul Stanley today  You got Letterman on Wednesday  We had Sharon on Thursday  It's fucking  I know what a  Seventh day hunk  This is huge  Peter Chris fucking  Yesterday  Thanks to Big Cam  I got a picture  With Peter Chris  Yeah it was fucking  Hey what's the deal 
[02:26:30]  That he didn't like  That question really  Which is fine  Well he didn't  What's the problem  With uh  I don't know  Kissing Peter Chris  I don't know  Cause I've heard  That him and Paul  Have a thing like  Which I forgot to ask  On the air  I would have asked  Over there  Yeah  Where they're like  Where they're just  Not really tall  I'm sure a listener  Will know  I don't know  Maybe a listener  Might know  Kev do you know  I think it's money  Money  It seems like  He has a good  Relationship with Ace  But it seems like  After years ago  Gene and Paul  I mean look  They kept Kiss alive  I mean Peter and Ace  Were gone  They're the two guys  And it seemed like  They were hired  I heard as musicians 
[02:27:00]  On the road  As opposed to sharing  Four ways  Kiss could go on  Without those  Kiss can't go on  Without those  Gene and Paul  But it did go on  Without the other two  Yeah  And I think  What was it  Singer  It was Eric Carr  I'm sorry  He died right  It was Eric Carr  Stephen Carr  Eric Carr was a drummer  I think longer than  Peter was  But I mean  People remember  Peter as the original drummer  Dude you're on  Like  Oh I know  Cloud 9 as they say  People are saying  Jim Norton's on  Cloud 9  At least mine was a girl  When the guest came in 
[02:27:30]  And I was gushing  And everything  It was a girl  I wasn't gushing  You were gushing  If we did the same exact thing  That you guys did to me  With the sound clips  And everything else  You would sit there  With douche chills  Going oh my god  Listen to how I'm talking  All we had to do  Is replay the walkover  Yeah  You were just  Because you were all just  You're talking too fast  And you're so adorable  You basically admitted  To childhood rape  Because you were  You were a hero  Yeah it really was  Stuff that we've been

[02:42:30]  I earned this  You should  This is something you should have  Like  I'm not  And I'm not turning it down  Because I don't like it  I like it a lot  But it's like  If it was given to you  By a dead friend  Who just died  Who dated  And you tried to get it signed  For a while  You should have this man  I can  I'm very lucky  I get access to autographed stuff  This is sentimental for you  And it's like  You should keep it  For the right reason  I appreciate it  Believe me I appreciate it  But it's something  That you should look  In a year  You might regret this  I think people  Give me things once in a while  That they regret  And it's like  You're like Don Corleone

[02:52:30]  He won't come on the show  Or am I going to  Fork over the bread  So I don't fork over  If he comes over  We get the $50  I don't give a shit  I mean  In a sense  I don't give a shit  But  I couldn't fucking believe that  And then I was thinking to myself  Fucking I should have just made  The fucking deal  For him to come on the show  And waited  And he would have signed  At the fucking show  For nothing  But of course  He's fucking signing it  While saying this  And I'm like  The fuck  So anyway  I want to let you know  That it's all done  It's all  It's all taken care of  It's safe 
[02:53:00]  It's secure  It's signed beautifully  Actually it looks much crisper  Than Gene's signature  The pen was great  The marker was great  We tested out a bunch  You know  Before we started  Time  We tested out a bunch  To make sure  The cleanest one was used  And it's all low and good  And I'm just  I'm flabbergasted  About the situation  It was just bizarre  And this is the second  Bizarre situation  I had with somebody  At this show  This weekend  Wait till you hear  The Anthony Michael Hall story  So that's it 
[02:53:30]  Give me a call back  Okay  Call me  I said everything  He wanted to hear  I wasn't mad at you  I was playing  On the bus  I mean  It was just funny  That  His punk wife  Fucking Kevin  Is like talking to her  About  Maybe Peter come on the show  It'll be a thing  And she's agreeing to it  And going  Yeah that'd be great  And she's signing it  She charges him 50 bucks  So this picture was signed  It costs 50 bucks  You damn rich cunt  I kill rich cunt  She was pretty much 
[02:54:00]  Just going yeah yeah yeah  She wasn't listening  No no no  She was listening  To everything I said  She actually  I told her the whole story  About  I embellished the story  A little  Saying that Jimmy  Was worried that  It wasn't going to  Get back from Denver  So he sent me  To his apartment  To get the picture  Just in case  He didn't make it back  Right  And she  Oh my god  That's a sweet story  And she gave me  This big hug  Oh you're such a good friend  50 bucks  And I put it down  In front of him  And then I turned  To say something else to her  And Peter is signing it  And as he's signing it  She says  Okay that'll be 50 dollars  Fuck you pay me  50 dollars 
[02:54:30]  To come on  And he was going to  Come on the show  Or whatever  And promote it  It's like  What type of  Fucking business sense  Is that  Like I know the guy  Is making a living  But  Business sense  Especially after  50 bucks  I heard a lot more  On that phone call  By the way  What  Because we've all  Been there with Jimmy  You know  Of course the pen  Had to be perfect  It was a perfect  Freaking sharpie  Are you saying  I was a bit obsessive  About my instructions  We've all seen you  Like practice with sharpies  To get the perfect  Sharpie for your autograph  He went through a few  And picked out one  That he liked  Yeah I know  A sharp tip full of ink  He picks out the 
[02:55:00]  Nice  Sharpie for the autograph  I know he wanted to know  That it was safe and secure  And that nothing was  Going to happen to it  And then we went yesterday  For my picture of Peter  And she was given  She's like  I didn't promise that  It was really like  A nightmare  Wow  And it was like  And then she's like  I know you're from the  He's like  You remember me  The Okie Finocie show  Yeah she didn't remember  Opie and Anthony  Okie Finocie  Wow that's something  I think that's new  I don't remember the name of it  I think that's new though  And I said to her  After I got the picture with him  I'm like  You know what  You might want to  Look up  You might want to 
[02:55:30]  Google Opie and Anthony  And she's like  Oh no I know  And I think  She thought I was mad  That she didn't know the show  But it's like  No no no  I'm talking business wise  This is the demo  You're looking for  Yeah this is good business  Dumbass  You should know this  If you're going to make  Fucking financial decisions  It's like the 50 bucks  Here and there  It's your fucking life  Your fucking life  There was a line  The entire weekend  And it was $50  $50  $50  And $25  And $25 for a picture  Or something like that  He's not getting  Peter  When we get really famous

[02:56:30]  50 bucks  You're right though  That's the first thing I said  If he comes in  That 50 bucks  Yeah we take it right out  Of his absolute  The second he comes out  In the door  It wasn't even that  Jimmy did everything  He could to say  Look  Jim was just in  Three weeks ago  Paul is in Monday  It's not like some  Fly by night  This is all I have to say  Book Peter Criss  On our show  Yeah  You want some radio  Get him on  Peter Criss  You want  Make sure you get  Your autograph before  Because  You want cringe  We'll get cringe  But I have to say  That's all I'm going to say  Right now  I have to  I have to in a way 
[02:57:00]  Say it was not  It was his  His wife  He didn't hear  Any of this conversation  No he didn't hear  I was having the conversation  With her about the photo  Yeah  And Peter was over there  Signing  So he didn't  It's not like Peter went  Whoa whoa  Get 50 from him  She made this decision  Which annoyed me even more  It's like  If you're going to make  A decision for your husband  The ex drummer from Kiss  And he has a solo album  Coming out  I'm sorry  Thank you  How do you not  Understand or not know  With this  In this demo  The Opie and Anthony show 
[02:57:30]  And then she wouldn't let  Jimmy use  His own camera  Because he's protecting  His image  So she wanted me to do  With a Polaroid  Wait what  What  I swear to God  Ask him  She wanted me to do  With a Polaroid  So I'm like  Say lady I could scan  This fucking thing  And put it out  All over the net anyway  But she doesn't want  His image to be leaked  Out onto the net  Leaked  His image couldn't drip out  But I wanted to  Fucking have the  Yeah  I wanted to have the photo  I think I could blow up  On the wall  Of course  Polaroid  What is it 1976 
[02:58:00]  It's your fucking right  50 bucks  It's your picture  And they're charging extra  If you took a picture with him  I think you're missing that point  I don't mind him  Doing a signing  And getting his money  I don't mind that  But there are legitimate things  It's like if you can't  Fucking differentiate  Between a guy  Bullshitting you  And this situation  Then you shouldn't be making  Most Petey Chris fans  Can't afford  $50 a shot  She can't see  The forest  For the trees  Atta boy  Yeah way to bring it home  Hey Pat  Hi Ope  So going back to you

[03:09:30]  There was like  70 original Warriors  Eight  Eight  There was Swan  There was fucking Cyrus  All those guys  Cyrus  But I didn't  The only guys that weren't there  Was fucking  The guy that played  The guy we interviewed  Fucking  Who is he  Oh  What's his name  He was in 48 Hours  Yeah  Oh Gans  Gans  He wasn't there  Gans from 48 Hours  And Warriors  That guy wasn't there  He wasn't there  Wasn't there  But the rest of the gang  Was there  And I didn't get pictures  With them  Because they were just like  It was like odd  Like  A bunch of old guys 
[03:10:00]  Yeah  Just old guys  And they charged for pictures  But I didn't mind  In these cases  These are guys  They're trying to make a living  And it really hit home for me  I walked up to this one guy  And I recognized him  He used to use cars  One of my favorite comedies  He's the guy that was afraid  To red cars  He was the one that was like  Dressed up as a sheriff  Going that's too fucking high  And I couldn't believe  He was there  And I'm fucking yapping at him  And it turns out  He's a Lucky Louie fan  And we were just talking  He's like that was a great show  So I'm like I can't  We're having a nice chat  And I'm like 
[03:10:30]  So how much do you charge  For a signed photo  And he was joking around  And he goes  Well normally 20  But for you  He goes oh I don't  He didn't want to charge me  But I'm like nah dude  I'm honored  And he goes well alright  Since you're working  We laughed  But I knew  Like when he said that  Like he kind of like  Wow I am working  And it's like  This guy hasn't worked  In a long time  Was he ever in anything else?  Yeah  He's been in a bunch  Of different things  Not like recently  You don't know his name  Like you might see him  Go oh that guy  Yeah you just see his face  And go oh it's that guy  He's one of those guys  Yeah  But it made me  Not sad  But like a little depressed  Like oh wow man 
[03:11:00]  Like you feel how lucky  You are to be doing a gig  And you see like this guy  I've laughed at this guy  For fucking 25 years  That movie has made me  Fucking laugh  And that was the guy  And there he is  Sign of pictures  And a lot of them  Were like that  And like it's really sad  To see like the booths  Where people walk by  And look over their stuff  And go don't know  Who the fuck you are  Yeah who are you  And keep going  And like what people do  We've had a couple  How many people are there?  It's clever  No I mean celebrity wise  A hundred  A hundred and twenty 
[03:11:30]  Yeah  And remember we did  The one signing  At Travis Center  Which was awful  And we kept hoping  That there'd be more people online  And like what you do is  When people walk over  And look at you guys  And realize  Alright I don't know  Who the fuck  These people are  We would all just  Kind of like look over  Their heads  Or look away  So we didn't have to  Make the eye contact  Shame of look  Yeah  I want you to know me  You don't know me  So you're leaving  Brings back memories  Of our Boston signing  Yeah  I was at  Oh yeah  No no this goes way back  And I put out a CD  And it did really well  And we did signings 
[03:12:00]  That did like last all day  Like six to eight hour signings  When you're in the suburbs  But we had one downtown  At that Old Tower Records  On Newberry Street  And we show up  And it was so depressing  We're behind this table  And they have the banners  And stuff  And a poster  Of our new CD  I think it was the first one  Actually  So it started this way  It ended up  Turning out to be okay for us  Because we did some  Massive signings  But that was just like  And we sat down like  What time  What time do we tell 
[03:12:30]  Everyone the signing's at  At noon  Oh it's 11.50  I'm sure they're just  Parking their cars  Late crowd  They gotta get  You know  Get off for lunch  So they don't get out  Until noon  And then I'm sure  By a quarter after  If we signed  25 autographs  In two hours  I'd be surprised  Where we're just like  So where are you from  How's the traffic  Getting to Boston  We're just stalling  As much as possible  So the line could build  And then you'd get like  Blink  One person going  To the back of the line  But you can't hold  This person anymore  So now  The ten people online  Turns back to  Nine people online  Yeah 
[03:13:00]  When you start seeing  The same guys  Come through twice  And you're like  This is easy  It sucks  What the hell  I might as well  Get one for my  Brother-in-law too  You know  Like yeah  It's cool  And inside  You're like  This isn't cool  I can't believe  This  We stink  What a douche  I am  We start asking  About what they're  Going to do  For the holidays  Just small talking  Our asses off  Trying to stretch it out  As long as possible  Hoping that we can  Build a scene  You know  And that's what happens  At these things also  Ninety-nine percent  Of the people  That they have  There are really  Gracious people  Who are really  Genuinely glad 
[03:13:30]  To meet you  Like all those  Warrior guys  They're really  They're so amazed  That anybody  Even remembers the film  That they're just  There's one guy  Apache Ramos  He just gets up  And meets every person  He shakes the hand  Of every person  That comes in  Of course he does  Comes up to his table  I got a good one  Which Ant would  Certainly appreciate  More than I think  Hope would  Because it's  Your obsession  Is fucking  Larry Durkin  Tony Burton was there  From Rocky  The fucking Apollo  Screamer  Oh yeah yeah  And I told him  Larry Durkin  Is my favorite thing  You ever did  And I didn't mind 
[03:14:00]  Paying these guys  Because it wasn't like  I wouldn't even  Mind paying Peter Criss  Except you know  The show tired  But these are guys  Making a living  Because you know  Again it's like  Watching the old  Ballplayers  Before the $20 million  Contract  These guys made  Fucking $50,000 a year  So go ahead  Make your money man  I don't  Well that's kind of  Where it all started  I bet you  It started in sports first  And then you know  Segment to entertainment  And they figured  We can make money  Signed sure  And there was a great  Cringe moment  That you would appreciate  At Anthony  When we went up  To the table  Of Aaron Moran  And he got recognized  And she comes running out
