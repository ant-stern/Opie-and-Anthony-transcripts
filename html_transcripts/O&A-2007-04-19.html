<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a furious condemnation of NBC and MSNBC's handling of the Virginia Tech shooting videotape.  Opie, Anthony, and James Norton vehemently criticized the networks for prioritizing ratings over responsible journalism, arguing that delaying contact with authorities and widely disseminating the shooter's video glorified the shooter and risked copycat attacks.  They drew a parallel to the Don Imus firing, highlighting perceived hypocrisy.  The hosts used copious profanity and extensively analyzed the video, comparing the shooter's demeanor to Napoleon Dynamite and criticizing comments by Steve Kappas and Keith Olbermann.  They interspersed this with promotions for their upcoming comedy tour, listing dates and featured comedians, and a humorous aside about a nude sunbather visible from their studio.

The show continued its focus on the Virginia Tech shooting and the media's coverage, discussing the graphic nature of the released materials and the perceived hypocrisy of showing this content while avoiding other potentially upsetting material.  Anger over the media's exploitation of the tragedy for ratings was a recurring theme.  The hosts speculated on the shooter's motives and mental state, considering his family and the possibility of copycat violence.  Callers offered varying perspectives, some sympathizing with the shooter's family, others condemning both the shooter and the media.  The hosts also discussed media sensationalism and the public's appetite for it.  Bob Saget called in to promote his stand-up shows, followed by Louis C.K., who offered his perspective on the shooting and media coverage.  Sanjaya Malakar's elimination from American Idol was briefly mentioned.  Profanity and offensive language were frequent throughout this segment.

The show then shifted to a discussion of hypothetical disasters, favoring an alien invasion over nuclear war.  This led to a broader discussion of human fascination with disaster, referencing Hurricane Katrina and the public's reaction to news coverage, suggesting a morbid curiosity drives viewership.  The hosts discussed societal desensitization, contrasting outrage over Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction with the enjoyment of watching suffering and crime.  A *USA Today* article about significant events experienced by 21-year-olds prompted reflection on personal childhood fantasies and morbid humor.  Louis C.K., already a guest, helped promote the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus College tour, initially with some confusion over pre-sale ticket information.  The show returned to analyzing the Virginia Tech shooter's videotape, criticizing NBC's decision to air it, highlighting the hypocrisy of bleeping curse words while broadcasting the shooter's message.  They discussed an interview with an NBC executive who attempted to justify the decision. Rob Bartley from the Imus show briefly called in to promote his performance.  Further plugs for the tour and other projects continued even after Louis C.K.'s initial departure. Opie then recounted a harrowing near-catastrophic flight experience, further exploring the topic of morbid fascination with disaster and the human response to near-death experiences.  Highly offensive language, including frequent use of the "c-word," was prevalent throughout this segment.

A subsequent segment opened with a discussion of a pilot's alleged lie about fuel levels, prompting listener calls sharing bad flight experiences.  Technical difficulties with a caller named Kenny led to humorous banter. Kenny eventually promoted pre-sale tickets for a Mohegan Sun show.  The conversation then shifted to staged emotional interviews, using a Larry King Live family interview as an example.  The hosts speculated about the production process and emotional manipulation.  This segued into a discussion of the movie *The Deep*, leading to highly vulgar and sexually charged jokes.  The conversation touched upon the lack of sex in marriage after having kids, marital challenges, and the hosts' own experiences with their wives, using crude and offensive language. Louis C.K. described his bleak, lonely touring routine, focusing on masturbation, room service, pornography, and avoiding human interaction. He discussed the strain on his marriage, candidly revealing his dislike for his wife (while stating he stays for the children).  The hosts and Louis C.K. discussed the challenges of marriage and parenthood, using vulgar and offensive language.  The segment ended with Louis C.K. promoting his shows and a final plug for the Opie and Anthony show.  Highly offensive language and discussions of sensitive topics were woven into comedic bits throughout.

The final segment centered on the struggles of marriage, particularly with children. Louie C.K. detailed his difficult marriage, expressing frustration and resentment towards his wife while acknowledging the complexities introduced by their children.  He described the overwhelming demands of parenting and his wife's lack of personal time.  The conversation became increasingly graphic and vulgar, with frequent profanity and sexually explicit language. Callers shared similar experiences of marital difficulties, including long periods without sex and infidelity.  The hosts and callers used crude humor and offensive language to describe their marital issues.  The discussion touched upon maintaining intimacy, communication, the allure of escape, and the role of children in maintaining relationships despite marital problems.  The show ended with the hosts' usual plugs and humorous closing banter, with no guests aside from Louie C.K.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Pissed off at us, man. We have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air, let's say racist things to each other.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off. 
[00:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:00]  It's a shame, but all the same, one night is in pain.  O.P.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, what's new?  Good morning.  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I got to say, I'm kind of a loser.  Kenny picks me up.  I couldn't get in the office fast enough to tell Anthony my observation about the videotape and the shooter whose name I don't feel like remembering. 
[00:02:00]  I just call him Cho.  Cho.  I don't go through the whole three-part name thing.  Everyone knows who you're talking about when you just say Cho.  So I run down the hall into the office.  I'm the last one in.  Anthony's sitting there and Travis and Sam and Dan and Steve in the other room. 
[00:02:30]  I burst through.  I'm ready to tell everyone what this guy sounds like.  Yeah.  And they're already doing their Napoleon Dynamite impressions in the office.  Yeah.  I thought I had a doozy for everybody.  Yeah.  Well, when I walked in, they had already been talking about it in the office.  As well.  Oh, yeah.  This is like, I think everyone figured this one out.  The, yeah, the Virginia shooter, Virginia Tech shooter in his multimedia manifesto, as they're calling it. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, yeah, they are.  It's the ramblings of a madman.  His multimedia manifesto.  He sounds like Napoleon Dynamite.  Yeah.  Come on.  You can't even call him a madman.  That's too good for him.  No, he's just.  It's the ramblings of a weirdo.  He's a weirdo who didn't get his own little way, who's jealous of people. 
[00:03:30]  And add this in with a liberal portion of being just psychotic, lunatic.  But he's blaming, like, I guess the rich, the privileged.  First, you're going to school with people.  They go to school, too.  And you're a dopey kid.  So he has no real life experience.  He has college experience.  And he barely talked to anybody. 
[00:04:00]  So he's just a rambling lunatic that all the news organizations now pawing over this, trying to find these little hidden meaning.  What did he mean when he said this?  Nothing.  He's crazy.  They're giving him some kind of, like, credibility.  Yeah, they're trying to.  Yeah, exactly.  There's really.  The motivation is that he was just a weirdo.  A weirdo.  That maybe some bad things happened to him as he was growing up.  But, see, the mean face, that.  He already killed a couple people.  I like mean face guy. 
[00:04:30]  He already killed a couple people in that shot right there.  So what happened?  MSNBC.  I have a real problem with NBC, MSNBC, and this is not a stretch whatsoever.  They just had Steve Kappas, the news director or whatever his title is.  Steve Kappas?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I call him.  For NBC.  Now, you've got to go back about a week, week and a half.  And they fired Don Imus from MSNBC. 
[00:05:00]  You're kidding.  Believe it or not, there's a connection between these two stories.  So they fired Don Imus.  And, you know, it's not about Don Imus, trust me.  But I'm trying to make a point here.  Yes, it is.  Steve Kappas goes on TV and basically says we had to fire Don Imus because what he did was very hurtful and very, very bad for society.  And the integrity of the news department is at risk.  And so he has to go.  Even though Steve Kappas knew exactly what kind of radio show Don Imus did for his 40-year career, right? 
[00:05:30]  So you're sitting there like, why is this guy not telling the truth that he just can't make money off Imus anymore because of the controversy?  And that's why he fired him.  It has nothing to do with integrity as far as the news department and all that goes.  Okay, so that happens last week.  They get this package at NBC, right?  They couldn't wait to get it on the air.  They couldn't wait.  They ran down the hall.  They're making copies.  Don't call the authorities until we got copies of everything. 
[00:06:00]  And then he's on TV last night going, we really struggled with this all day long.  We weren't sure if we should air this on NBC.  We weren't sure if we should give this to Brian Williams to do a piece on.  Are you kidding me?  Dude, they're divvying it up and portioning it out to keep this rating string alive as long as possible.  Here's what happened.  The overnight mail delivery, whatever it was, I think it was just the U.S. Postal overnight, 
[00:06:30]  got this package to bring to NBC.  The letter carrier noticed where it was from, saw the address on there.  The return address didn't have his name on it, but it had that Ishmael thing that he writes.  It was from Ishmael.  And he saw the address, though, was from where all this happened down there in Virginia.  So he brought it to the attention of NBC and said, look, I think this package might be from from the kid that did this. 
[00:07:00]  So instead of calling the police who might want to take special care in opening the package,  you don't know what's in there.  It could have been booby trapped, booby trapped.  Yeah, but just the idea that it might be from the shooter.  Right.  They were they were they were.  Oh, my God.  They were all just probably pants down to their knees, salivating, just they couldn't wait to get it on themselves. 
[00:07:30]  So so they got and they're justifying this on their show last night on all the news shows on NBC.  Yeah, we're getting some of these comments because I was watching on.  You got to be kidding.  They're justifying the fact that they called NBC security to open up this package.  Dave, we we worked at NBC for a little while during our XFL days.  Yeah.  You know what NBC security is?  It's the guy that tells you what elevator bank to go to if you got to go up to, like, the 30th floor. 
[00:08:00]  The third one on the right.  The guy you run into and you have to sign in before you go to the elevator banks.  So they were the ones that opened up this package, NBC security.  They they went through the materials, made copies of everything, which took a couple of hours before they call the actual authority.  And then they called the police.  Because I guarantee if you call the FBI right away, they're there.  You don't have a chance to make copies.  They're not going to sit there and go, well, our guys are on lunch break.  We'll be right over.  No, we want to make sure we get any forensic evidence we can off of this stuff. 
[00:08:30]  If we can't be handling it like this, not here at NBC, we're going to go to our lab in a nice sterile environment where we can get maybe little things that are falling off of this package, whatever.  But no, they just opened it up and made their copies because they knew that this was the ratings grabber.  They got gold because they did farm it out to all the other news organizations. 
[00:09:00]  But every news organization has to say where the tape was mailed to NBC front page of all the papers.  They got it.  They got the picture of the guy with, you know, both guns in his hands.  And you see, like, the NBC logo so tiny because they're going to sue.  They're going to sue if you don't mention that this package was mailed to NBC.  And then they divvied it out to Brian Williams.  More clips are going to be played on the Today Show this morning. 
[00:09:30]  They said they want to go through the clips to see what would be appropriate and stuff.  Meanwhile, it's just an excuse to divvy it out so all of their various programs get new clips.  And they could promo it by saying brand new clips of the killer on the Today Show.  And the point I'm trying to make, so with the Imus thing, the integrity of the news department, this is very bad for America, blah, blah, blah.  And then they got this tape and they couldn't wait to get it on the air.  And it's so obvious. 
[00:10:00]  This would do so much more damage in this country than Don Imus saying what he did.  And why not comment on what a dick this kid is?  Like, why don't the anchors, when Imus was up there in the news, when we were fired, you know, they couldn't wait to just editorialize on what jackasses we were for doing what we did.  But meanwhile, they report this kid.  They got him there with his guns, just babbling like a little poor jealous idiot about the things he doesn't have. 
[00:10:30]  And the privileged kids and blah, blah.  And instead of editorializing on that, they play it over and over again, doing exactly what this kid wanted.  Getting his face on the news, getting his word across, whatever that is, some lunatic ramblings.  And showing how great this is, a great way to make yourself infamous for history.  Yeah.  And NBC, they helped us right along. 
[00:11:00]  You played right into the killer's hands.  And there will be copycat shootings almost immediately.  Oh, yeah.  Based on this.  So, you know, just watch the damage you did by airing this video.  And now, this is where I bring it all around.  I think the video absolutely should be shown on TV.  But I also think Mr. Imus there should be able to say whatever the hell he wants on his radio show.  But to sit there and say, you know, that what he did was harmful and then ignore how harmful this video is to be shown all over the country is completely ridiculous. 
[00:11:30]  Why don't you just say what's really on your mind?  You couldn't make money with Imus anymore, so you got rid of him.  There's no integrity in the news department.  And you know he can make an S-load of money off this videotape.  So you are going to give it to Brian Williams.  You're going to give it to the Today Show.  And you're going to just release little pieces for the next week or so.  The ratings for MSNBC and NBC are going to be through the roof.  I personally hate MSNBC because of what they did last week.  Of course that's all I watched last night. 
[00:12:00]  Because I said, what, they mailed this to NBC?  Of course they're going to have the best coverage.  You wanted to see the clips.  But to sit there and say that, you know, there's integrity involved and all that, it's all about money.  Now you've got something that you know he can make a lot of money off and get a lot of ratings off.  That's the only reason.  And for Steve Kappas to sit there and say, blah, blah, blah.  Kappas!  We struggled with this decision all day and decided it really needed to be seen.  You guys couldn't wait to get it on the evening news. 
[00:12:30]  They love it.  And if they wanted to do the right thing and have integrity and stuff, they would have called the cops.  They would have called the FBI immediately and left that envelope sitting on a desk, closed, and said, you guys got to take care of this.  Yeah, they covered their asses.  They had some very, very kind of shady, you know, explanation how they handled it.  Like you were saying it.  And then I heard him go, we had NBC security.  And many of these gentlemen are former law enforcement people.  He actually said that to try to justify why a bunch of what amounts to rent-a-cops were opening up an envelope from somebody that killed 32 people in an atmosphere that is not conducive to collecting evidence that might be in or on that envelope. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  If you gave it to the authorities right away, that would not see the light of day.  No, you'd never see it.  You'd never see it.  Maybe years down the road, like with the Columbine thing, I think they finally released some of that surveillance.  Rainy surveillance video.  They didn't release that two days after the shooting, three days after the shooting. 
[00:13:30]  Meanwhile, it was an overnight package and the dummy, the dummy murderer there couldn't even get the zip code right.  Right.  He wrote Rockefeller Center.  He wrote Rockefeller Lane or something like that.  Yeah.  Wrote the zip code wrong.  So instead of it getting there the next day, it wound up getting there yesterday.  A couple days later.  There's a guy who wrote a book on this.  He's an expert on these type of guys and violence.  And he says, his name is Gavin DeBecker, and he said that the worst thing you can do is show this type of video. 
[00:14:00]  Of course.  They shouldn't have showed the video because it's not really.  It's just, it's some scum that I make a home video.  It's like showing suicide bomber videos when they're over in Israel.  Right, beforehand.  It's empowering them.  So what NBC and campus are doing is they really are helping the next person who's going to commit these murders have a reason for doing it.  Look at the climate.  Look at the climate we're living in in these days, especially with a lot of young people this age.  It's all based around getting attention through blogs, through your YouTube videos. 
[00:14:30]  Who doesn't want their YouTube videos and MySpace page?  You want the most friends.  You want the most views on your YouTube videos.  This is the next step.  They were calling it a multimedia manifesto.  So it's like a blog and YouTube videos and a MySpace wrapped into a package and delivered to a news organization that then is not going to play it on just the Internet. 
[00:15:00]  It's going everywhere.  It's going on national television.  So for a lot of these people that are on the edge like this, psychopaths, lunatics that want this type of attention and have been using the Internet to do it, they now have a new way of getting their image and their ideology, no matter how lunatic it is, out there to the public through network television.  With the same type of video and blog-like ramblings that they were just able to get on the Internet beforehand. 
[00:15:30]  So, yeah, you're absolutely right.  This will get people that are on the edge to go, wow, this kid made an impact doing what he did.  This kid got famous.  This kid got famous.  His face is all over the news this morning.  The second my clock radio went off this morning, I woke up to his voice.  Right.  And he's being shown as powerful with guns.  DeBecker said they should paint these kids like what they really are, which is these nerds who have no friends. 
[00:16:00]  They are losers.  Start editorializing.  Yes.  Editorialize when you play the clip saying, now, let me show you this.  You know, obviously, this kid has mental problems, and, you know, he's just a spoiled brat who didn't feel he had what other people wanted.  You know, yeah, paint him for what he is.  A piece of garbage, wanting, not willing to work for it, jealous. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  That's what he is.  Now we get to sit back and wait for the copycats, and it will happen.  They were saying it all over the news.  It's not if.  They're basically saying when.  When will it happen?  Will it be today?  Will it be next week?  It will definitely be before the end of the school year.  That's a guarantee.  A guarantee.  And I even told Anthony, I'm going to say it again.  We were talking about the Columbine thing, the anniversaries coming up, and Hitler's birthday.  I said it on Monday, the day of the shooting off air. 
[00:17:00]  I go, oh, that's Friday?  Oh, great.  Something really bad is going to happen.  Yeah.  They love doing things around this time.  And the anniversary of Columbine, Hitler's birthday.  Because, you know, the news screwed up.  They glorified Columbine.  Yeah.  You know, but they'll go at their shock jocks and violent video games and an old white guy  saying some off-the-hand dumb comment.  That's what's, you know, society's problem?  Are you kidding me?  Instead of what's giving them a direct pipeline to the rest of society. 
[00:17:30]  Why don't you look inside your own walls and see what you're doing?  You just glorify this weirdo for the rest of the weirdos out there.  Made him a massive star.  That's exactly what he wanted.  Why do you think he put himself on video?  And mailed it to NBC.  He mailed it to a news organization full of video.  It's exactly what he wanted.  Is fat slug Al Roker going to blog about how he doesn't appreciate his network showing this?  Yeah, why don't you write a letter talking about how awful the president is for, the president of NBC is for doing this? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Ah, shut up.  Nah, he doesn't have the balls because that would affect his job now.  You'd get fired.  Of course he would.  Of course he would.  Of course.  And Keith Oberman with his just BS coming out of his mouth last night.  I'm trying to get that clip.  How he had to set up this whole thing.  Justify it.  They're all justifying.  They're trying to all justify it because they know.  They know they have gold, but they also know, wow, people are going to come down on us hard for airing this stuff.  You couldn't find, also, I was watching some of the coverage on NBC and MSNBC, 
[00:18:30]  and every time they played a clip of this kid, there were more NBC logos and watermarks.  Not only, you know how they usually put the logo in the corner?  Yeah.  There was an actual watermark scrolling through the picture itself.  Like a very clear, very subdued NBC logo scrolling through, like the ticker does on the bottom,  scrolling through the video itself. 
[00:19:00]  Like they wanted it.  You aren't going to get this video and play it without our logo on it.  I'm looking at the Daily News right on the cover.  Even the picture says NBC News.  Like NBC took this shot of the kid.  Yeah, with the peacock.  No, he just happened to send it to you guys.  And then every picture on the paper, look at your local paper.  All pictures courtesy of NBC.  All pictures courtesy of NBC.  I mean, you can't even turn the page without seeing the NBC logo or all pictures courtesy of NBC. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Because it's important to get credit.  Like what you're doing is you're showing basically the ramblings of some little douchey murderer.  And you're going to help other people do this.  Yeah.  So you might as well get full credit for it and have your logo scrolling.  Go ahead.  So when it does happen and there's a copycat killer that does this and makes a tape or something like that, will NBC be like, wow, we're just a news organization.  Hey, we're not responsible for anything we do. 
[00:20:00]  Everyone else is.  But we're the news, so we're not responsible.  You know, the copycat thing is going to happen.  So if there's a weirdo out there, you know, just make sure when you make your manifesto, you blame NBC.  Go, hey, I did this because I know I could get famous because NBC showed that other video.  Yeah.  There you go.  And then sent it to another news organization.  Unbelievable.  But to talk about the integrity of the news department, and this is bad for society when they dumped IMAS.  And, you know, we've moved on from IMAS, you know. 
[00:20:30]  But then the next week, only days later, just throwing this all over your network, you couldn't wait to get it to Brian Williams and the Today Show.  You're a joke.  You're not a news organization.  You're an entertainment program.  Just admit it.  And then how about also, you know, they play as ramblings.  They've played interviews with people that were there in the classrooms that were being shot up, just talking about horrific things, what they saw. 
[00:21:00]  And yet, during this idiot's manifesto, they bleep out the dirty words.  The priorities in this country are ridiculous.  That's a joke, too.  Yeah.  Play the whole thing with this lunatic showing, you know, pointing guns at the camera, just professing his hatred towards people that are achieving more than he is.  Yet, they bleep out when he says, like, the S-bomb or the F-bomb.  Yeah.  Because that might hurt someone. 
[00:21:30]  That might, like, you can watch this whole thing, and not one person will call into the switchboard or the FCC and complain.  Yeah.  Yet, if one of those S-words or F-words would have slipped through, there would have been all kinds of complaints to the FCC that my children were watching, and they heard the S-word.  The media.  Meanwhile, the whole thing is damaging.  Yeah.  The media is just a joke.  We are on upside-down world.  Right.  That's why.  It's ridiculous.  That's why we love pointing all this stuff out, how hypocritical it is. 
[00:22:00]  There's double standards.  It's just a joke.  What's more damaging to a kid, seeing that or hearing a curse?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Kids are cursing by the time they're in first grade or whatever.  Yeah, stop it with the curses already.  You know what's more damaging is the picture on the front page of the post.  That is downright frightening to anyone that's in school.  He's an action star right there.  He looks like he's an action movie hero.  They're painting him as.  He looks like he's in a John Woo movie. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  And that's the front page of the cover of every paper in America, right?  If you're a lunatic on the fence and you see that picture, you're going to be like, cool.  Yeah, look at me.  I can look cool.  But if you're a kid, you see that?  That's downright frightening.  I mean, his eyes, he's got crazy eyes because he took this shot after he already killed people.  Crazy eyes, Opie.  And then you got the, you got bloody dude on the paper a couple days ago.  Yeah.  But if, God forbid, a boob slips out or occurs. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, my God.  Boobies and bad words everyone's concerned about.  But when it gets into anything deeper, these morons can't see an inch in front of their face.  Boobies and bad words are the worst possible thing you could broadcast on television, on radio.  If you show the Janet Jackson thing for a split second.  If I right now dropped the S-bomb and it wasn't dumped out of, we are so screwed. 
[00:23:30]  Yet you can play the rantings and ramblings of a lunatic murderer that will inspire other people,  absolutely inspire other people to do copycat crimes and get their face on the news.  And that is fine.  It's just we are in this upside down society that I don't know who's running this asylum.  The school shootings escalated because of the media. 
[00:24:00]  I have no doubt in my mind.  You know, they glorified Columbine for ratings.  They knew they had a great story there.  They couldn't wait to get the surveillance video on TV.  They couldn't wait to interview all the victims and this and that.  And we all know their names.  We all know their faces.  That was the media.  But no one will point fingers at them because they were doing, quote, news.  But now we got this.  And the guy even referred to, you know, the Columbine shooting and those guys.  And it's being used as they're teasing it. 
[00:24:30]  Like I said before, you know, the Today Show is going to be getting new video from this collection that he sent over.  And they're promoing it.  New video.  It's like, so you're using it.  If you had it all, why not just play it all?  And Al Roker's going to sit there like the fat load hypocrite he is.  He's going to sit there and not speak his mind because that would be his job.  Let's see how brave you are, Al. 
[00:25:00]  You know it's wrong.  Everyone knows it's wrong.  Just look out for boobies and curse words because that'll hurt people.  That'll hurt people.  Al Roker won't say a word.  Boobies, curse words, and any racial or sexual jokes.  Ooh, look out.  Well, our phones are lit, obviously.  And we got the Brian Williams audio where he broke this to the world on NBC.  They are directly contributing to the next people who are murdered like this. 
[00:25:30]  They are directly contributing to it.  Dude, I, and I'm not even kidding.  I was this close to throwing something through my TV when that stupid Steve Kappas was talking.  Kappas, Opie.  That's what I call him.  Steve Kappas.  I'm sitting there going, you're going to try to justify why you're playing this?  I would have more respect for you if you said, look, man, we got a gem here, and we're going 
[00:26:00]  to exploit this for ratings and cold hard cash instead of saying, well, we got to get a statement.  It's unbelievable.  Or at least pick it apart and play it in the proper context where maybe, maybe you can show  this guy for what he was and not portray him as this loner movie.  You know what it is about the news, and we've commented on this before.  The news these days wants to be a TV show.  They don't want to be the news.  It's newsertainment, they've called it. 
[00:26:30]  It's like a movie.  We've seen it with the soundtracks that they put behind certain stories.  When they're teasing a story that's horrific, they'll play like this ominous music like you're  watching one of the Saw movies, or they'll play action movie music if it's a car chase  thing that they're talking about.  They want it to be like a movie.  So in this situation, they're playing it off like a John Woo movie.  They're playing it off with showing this kid with his guns drawn, looking what is going 
[00:27:00]  to amount to looking cool to other people that might be having these thoughts.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Which is 80,000 times more damaging than hearing a nausea word or seeing a boobie.  And he mentioned Dylan Erick.  He mentioned them.  Oh yeah, he mentioned them.  You know, the other people that the media talked about and wouldn't shut their mouths about  and talked about the way they wanted to be spoken about instead of the two little homoerotic 
[00:27:30]  one-gloved douches that they were.  And then people quote them and they glorify it for ratings and this is what you get.  All right, we're fired up once again today.  It's been an unbelievable couple of weeks of radio.  It's just angering.  And things happening in our world here.  I was on a few message boards last night and I get ready to post and I'm like thinking  out something and then I just went, I go, what are you doing?  And I just shut my browser down.  I go, there's no, why am I bothering? 
[00:28:00]  Trying to like discuss this situation in text.  On what message board?  I don't know.  There was some stuff written on a New York radio message board that I was going to comment  on and then a few of the other ones, you know, whack bag and things like that.  And I'm just like, you know, screw it.  Why bother?  You just sit there and argue like an idiot back and forth.  And so I just went to full tilt and played some cards.  There you go.  All right, we'll go right to the phones.  I mean, calls from all over the country today. 
[00:28:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Thanks for checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We appreciate it.  Andrew, he writes off the instant feedback.  Networks won't show fans who run on the field of a sports game because they're afraid of copycats. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, brilliant.  But they have no problem with helping a mass murderer glorify himself after his rampage and make him look like a powerful action hero.  Brilliant.  Oh, yep.  Someone out there is listening.  What a great point.  Yeah, they never show the stupid idiots that jump out on the field.  And that's a goof.  You kind of want to see that.  They came up with that policy a while ago.  We don't want copycats. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Okay.  Well, let's show this mass murderer.  Uh, what did you...  Huh?  What?  Yeah, that's what she said by, uh...  Yeah, where did I...  Oh, okay.  I got it.  Oh, okay.  She's naked.  She's naked!  Yeah, what did she put on?  Like, stockings?  They look like those girdle stockings.  Oh, that girl's disgusting.  It's such a drag.  We got this girl. 
[00:30:00]  She gets naked every morning across the way.  Got a hotter chick in that building.  That would be really nice.  No blinds, no shades.  We see her naked every day, and there's not much excitement around here.  It's more just a thing to check out.  Because it's, like, the only naked woman in a window.  Yeah, and we have, uh, we...  Out of this window, we probably have accessed, uh...  I would say...  A thousand windows.  I was gonna say a thousand, but at least 500 windows.  And we found one where there's a naked girl every morning. 
[00:30:30]  Chubsy-ubsy.  She knows she's naked.  Uh, what I mean by that, she knows that other people could possibly see her.  Because she has no shades or blinds.  She's not shy.  But she's just a mess.  And she gets on her exercise bike every morning.  And we've noticed it's not doing much good.  Anyway, our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  This is, uh, this is what I was talking about as far as Keith Overman goes.  Yeah.  Oh, before you play anything, Opie, I have to slap this NBC logo on your head.  Oh, NBC. 
[00:31:00]  Before any of us talk about it, we actually have to slap a logo on our head.  Right.  That says NBC and has the little colorful peacock.  Bunch of whores.  I'd have more respect for you if you said, hey, this is a ratings grabber.  We're going to go with this.  Instead of, uh, BS statements like this.  NBC News turned over the entire contents to the FBI and has cooperated fully with the authorities.  And as our Brian Williams pointed out earlier tonight, we know we are airing the words of a murderer.  After great debate, we think the story so transcends our experience as people that reporting this part of that story is necessary. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my.  Great debate?  There was no great debate.  You know what the debate was?  All right, who gets which clips?  Yeah.  Uh, all right, give Brian Williams these.  Brian Williams has to get these.  He's got to break the story.  He's our man.  These clips have more of an entertainment angle, so we'll give them to the Today Show.  Entertainment angle.  This has a local feel to it, so why don't we give it to the local NBC affiliate in New York?  What's going to trickle down to, like, Judge Judy?  Yeah, no kidding.  That was the great debate, how to divvy up the clips to make everyone look like a star yesterday and today. 
[00:32:00]  By the way, if it was news, they would never make a disclaimer like this.  You don't make a disclaimer like this with real news.  They know they're going to catch crap for it, so they have to do these disclaimers and rationalize the whole thing.  And you hear what he said?  We've turned these over to the police.  Not immediately.  You didn't.  You make, because I'm thinking, when I first heard this and I heard they had clips and were playing them,  I'm thinking, wait a minute. 
[00:32:30]  The cops should have this.  How did they get, like, copies to play?  And then I realized there was a couple of hours before they called the cops.  Yeah.  They got the letter and then they opened it.  NBC security opened it.  They made copies of everything.  Then called the police and the FBI.  They made copies.  Why?  Because they wanted to air it.  They were tampering with evidence.  It's their letter.  They got it.  But to tell you the truth, yeah, you're kind of tampering with evidence. 
[00:33:00]  And, you know, they're saying that the package arrived a little late because, you know, the address was wrong.  Uh-huh.  They need a little time because, you know, this was a pretty big package.  A lot of video clips to go through and a lot of writings.  You know, that takes time to get copies of all that.  They were tampering with evidence.  But where's the outrage?  And I wouldn't even be focusing on this too much if it wasn't for the fact that Steve Kappas last week was saying that what Imus did was really bad for, you know, the country. 
[00:33:30]  And the integrity of the news department was at risk.  Oh, sorry.  What happened?  Well, Tom Brokaw?  No, you're talking about it.  So we figure, you know, you got to play the NBC News music just so everyone knows.  I like how you slap that right on your forehead, that big NBC peacock.  I'm going to just get it tattooed.  Just tattooed on my arm. 
[00:34:00]  So you can talk about it any time.  Yeah, absolutely.  With impunity.  So, but here we go.  Here's Steve Kappas.  He's just full of S.  Just full of crap.  Crap-ass.  Any news organization has two sets of choices to make here.  A, notify authorities or don't notify authorities.  And B, run this, don't run this.  Were there any doubts about the answers to either of those questions?  Oh, I think, you know, that whole process is long and complicated.  And it went on all day today. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, our first reaction was, you know why it went on all day, quote, end quote?  Because, because Brian Williams goes on at what, 6.30?  Yeah.  That was the only reason.  You have to figure out what clips are going to be played.  They knew they had gold.  Get the best clips.  They weren't going to break in the middle of the day when most people are still at work.  They're like, we'll wait till 6.30 on this, man, when we know.  I mean, they study this crap.  We're going to have a massive audience.  Why would we release this, like, at 2, 3 in the afternoon, maybe get a little bit because it was, you know, a special report, but then everyone would be on it by the nightly news? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, they wanted to break it.  They wanted exclusivity when the most people were watching.  This guy is full of crap.  It went on all day today.  I mean, our first reaction was to immediately cooperate with authorities and get these documents into their hands so that they could figure out what we had. 
[00:35:30]  After you made copies.  And with Pete's help, we expedited that process and got it into the hands immediately of the FBI.  And we started speaking with the lead investigators, with the Virginia State Police, all the way through.  And they made what I thought was a reasonable request to not release any of this information until they could see what it meant to the investigation.  And we also had a lot of conversations here about the sensitivity of all this and whether it would be appropriate to release it. 
[00:36:00]  And, you know, we sat on this for hours while we had all those conversations all day long.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Could any more crap come out of his mouth?  I pray our listeners are hearing it how we're hearing it.  This guy's full of, you know what, tampering with evidence, should have handed it over immediately.  All of a sudden, he's part of the investigation.  You're a news organization. 
[00:36:30]  You get this evidence.  You give it right to the FBI and the authorities down there in Virginia, what have you.  You're not in discussions with those people.  He's presenting this as if they immediately handed it over to police, which they didn't.  They didn't.  NBC Security opened it.  And you made copies immediately.  Immediately.  Because you wanted to take advantage of it.  Because they knew that once the cops were notified, they were whisking that away and you're not playing it or getting copies of it or anything.  Because then at that point, eventually it would be released in the entire media. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, very slowly.  How do you have security open evidence?  I mean, how is that like you, knowingly, if it wasn't just a regular package, you knew it was something and you didn't call the cops.  Well, that's why they kind of are using like, well, they used to be detectives.  Yeah, yeah.  They used to be like police officers.  I've never heard so many excuses being made for something that, ever since the anthrax thing, suspicious packages are opened up by these guys.  So many excuses.  That are retired detectives. 
[00:37:30]  For something that is supposed to be totally fine.  Right.  Then why the hell are you having to justify every move you made in this?  And that, uh, that Cor made that point about the, uh, the way they don't show sports, uh, guys running across the field.  Yep.  What a great point because they don't want copycats.  This, they know, is probably going to get other students shot and they don't care about aiding copycats.  That's all right.  They really don't care.  They can just blame it on video games or something else.  They don't have to blame it on the easy targets.  The fact that you're glorifying this guy. 
[00:38:00]  Blame it on a John Woo movie.  Yeah.  Something music.  Blame it on music.  Yeah.  Dumb band or some dumb violent video game.  Well, here's Kappas, uh, just BS and some more talking about, uh, how he's worried about the copycat thing, Jimmy.  Did the investigators have any reluctance about putting this on the air, both in the, in the sense of fulfilling this murderer's wishes and the prospect that obviously has to be considered of perhaps inspiring copycats?  Well, uh, we had an, uh, by the way, um, I, Keith Overman is just Steve, uh, Kappas's, uh, you know, puppet. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's asking, he's asking the tough questions because they already have the answers written down.  Yeah.  Like he's not asking this guy any questions he doesn't know, have an answer for.  The answer has been thought out, written down, uh, to protect them as, as best they can.  Keith Overman is a disgrace.  He's a puppet.  Yeah.  It's like, uh, he had a meeting with, uh, you know, what, he just happened to have the president on a show and he's going to ask the tough questions like Ann's saying, no, they sat down in a room.  This is how we handle it. 
[00:39:00]  You ask these questions.  You ask these leading questions.  I'll give these answers.  And it should cover us so we could get back into, you know, just getting ratings, uh, and, and making money off this tape.  Oh my God.  I can't sit here and, and, and buy their explanation.  It's, it's ridiculous.  It's time that we really start focusing on what, what the news media does do in this country.  If they could drag those Virginia tech student bodies through the NBC studios and be allowed to show it, they would do it.  Oh, they would do it.  They would do it.  They would drag those bodies to the studio and film it if they could get away with doing it. 
[00:39:30]  We pay real close attention to this stuff because, you know, we'll, we'll screw up and we'll, we'll, we'll be portrayed as the devil on their news programs.  Or they'll talk about the violent video games, like Ant said, or, or, you know, these, uh, these action movies that that's the real problem in America when, when these guys are doing far worse.  Now, what's his answer perhaps inspiring copycats?  Well, uh, we had a, uh, conversation with the, uh, Virginia state police about that and, uh, and their cautionary words were to, to, uh, be mindful of that. 
[00:40:00]  And, uh, but they also said, uh, you know, that they, they looked at this and, um, and, and they, uh, said they understood that it, that it was, you know, their, their words were, it's okay to release this.  It, it, it, it's not going to jeopardize the investigation.  They said, just be mindful of how much you use because they did not want to, to get into a situation like, uh, you know, that you described.  There's a lot of semantics going on here. 
[00:40:30]  Did you hear that?  What does mindful mean?  Or we had discussions that in the other clip, like we had discussions, mindful of this.  And then they said, uh, it's okay.  It won't affect the investigation.  So that, that almost was leading you to believe that they said it was okay to play.  They didn't.  They said it was okay that it wouldn't affect the investigation, but it would affect other people that might be of this mindset to go off and, and try to copy this.  Right. 
[00:41:00]  So they said, be mindful.  What's that?  What does that mean?  Be mindful.  I think they're underplaying what the authorities probably said, which, you know, it really isn't a good idea to play this.  They basically said, what do you, please don't.  Watch what he just does.  Can you play the last moment?  Cause he, where he goes, ah, what you just said.  He doesn't even, Kappas doesn't even, whatever his name is.  Uh, what is it?  Which one?  Kappas doesn't even say copycat.  He was mindful of what you just said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, don't say it.  I don't even know where it is. 
[00:41:30]  Is it something in the last moment?  Don't say it.  You know, that they, they looked at this and, um, and, and they, uh, said they understood that it, that it was, you know, their, their words were, it's okay to release this.  It, it, it, it, it's not going to jeopardize the investigation.  They said, just be mindful of how much you use because they did not want to, to get into a situation like, uh, you know, that you described.  See, he doesn't want to say you described.  They don't want to get into a situation, you know, that you described.  There's probably a memo that was passed around right after that that said, do not use the word copycat now. 
[00:42:00]  Do not use it.  Uh, let's say hi to John in Long Island.  John, what's up?  Hey there, Jan.  How are you?  Hey.  I think there's got to be some kind of paper trail that you can show what time that package was delivered and then what time the police were notified just to show what he said immediately.  Yeah.  I don't know what immediate means to him.  I bet it was two or three hours.  Hey, I heard last night it was two hours before they even notified the police that that envelope was there. 
[00:42:30]  So within that two hours, it was opened.  Uh, all the materials were copied and then it was handed over to, uh, the police.  You know, it would have been great and I hate to say it, but what if there was a homemade bomb by this psycho?  That's just it.  You never know.  You just don't know.  The guy's a lunatic.  He shot up 32 people, uh, including himself.  And they're just opening this.  Don't you think perhaps, uh, experts should have gone in there and said, and seen if there was some type of booby trap, uh, on the thing? 
[00:43:00]  No, he called his $7 an hour, rent the cops.  Yeah.  To go there and open it for them.  Yeah.  But I, I guess they have, uh, power cause they're the news or NBC.  I don't know where, where they have this leeway.  Can you imagine in your job, if you had some kind of evidence to a huge case like this and you took your time calling the authorities, what would happen to you?  Oh, you'd be fired, but you can't say not behead at all.  Right.  Yeah.  That's damaging.  Exactly.  That is, uh, boobies are damaging and curse words are damaging. 
[00:43:30]  Well, it's over.  It's all over.  And they'd be the first people to jump on any dumb jock that says anything bad or anybody on TV or, or Simon Cowell for rolling his eyes.  You know, they're the first ones to just pounce on that because they're so high and mighty.  Yeah.  Yet when it comes to something like this, that's based purely on ratings, they knew this was going to be a goldmine of ratings.  And brave, uh, Keith Olbermann went behind closed doors with, with his Steve Kappas to say that Ima should be fired and didn't have the balls to say it on his own show until it was safe to say it when Ima was finally out the door. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Keith, why don't you, uh, why don't you quit?  Yeah.  Because this is, this is really bad.  You do understand that this is really bad, right?  This will have more of an overall effect.  This will help copycat killers.  Yeah.  This will help copycat killers.  Yeah.  And it's going to happen.  It's like a little lesson on what to do to get your, yourself, uh, in the news.  So where's the outrage with your company? 
[00:44:30]  Just a bunch of poohahs.  Al Roker will keep his mouth shut.  Oberman will keep his mouth shut.  And he'll, he'll tow the company line.  You're a puppet.  You're a puppet for MSNBC and Steve Kappas.  Uh, Tom, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, Tom.  Yeah, how about they're saying the zip code is wrong, but there's a clip of a lady from  the post office saying she remembers this guy because she personally put the zip code 
[00:45:00]  in for him.  So a postal employee put that in there, but NBC is saying it's wrong.  Well, I was scratched out like three times the zip code.  Right.  Like he couldn't get the zip code right.  And then she helped him with it.  I don't think there's a problem with the actual zip code or delivery of it.  Um, but it's just the fact that it sat in the office for, for as long as it did.  I doubt they're lying about that because they have computers that track every package.  You can't, you can't get with lying about that.  They showed it went out.  It was, he delivered it to, uh, the, the post office and it was timestamped at like 
[00:45:30]  nine Oh one, um, AM.  Um, so it was a half an hour before he went off, which is why he took that time.  It was to make a video.  It was between, yeah, there, there's, well, he dropped it off between the first killings  and the second killings.  Yeah.  So that's what he was doing between that.  And that might be why he had some statements talking about murders in the past tense.  It's because he actually had done them.  Russell Jersey.  What's up?  Yeah.  Listen, is there any time at all in the near future when the press is going to 
[00:46:00]  stop talking about this story at all?  Uh, no, it's, it's a ratings grabber.  That's the only reason they're going to continue with this.  That's the only reason they don't, they don't care about the victims.  They don't care about society in general.  They don't care about the college kids and how they're in danger.  They don't care about any of that.  They care about one thing, ratings.  Yeah.  But how about like the poor people that are laid up somewhere and they got nothing but  television or radio to listen to or newspaper to read. 
[00:46:30]  And it's like, there's nothing going on in the world.  Oh, besides this freaking story, you know?  Oh, well, there is, uh, I believe, uh, 160 people were blown to bits in Iraq yesterday.  Yeah.  There you go.  Jesus.  Why did you come on?  You just mentioned it now.  I mean, yeah.  Four separate car bombings, uh, killed over 150 people in Iraq.  How about that?  And Governor Corzine, uh, you know, wasn't wearing a seatbelt and he was going 91 miles an  hour when he almost died in that horrific car crash.  And he was using his, uh, his sirens and stuff. 
[00:47:00]  You hear what they have to do to him now?  And Bloomberg is kind of, uh, calling him a dope in the paper.  Yeah.  Or I saw it in the headline.  I'm not sure if he used the actual word dope.  I don't think he used the word dope.  All right.  But you hear what they're doing to him now?  They had to put these like little pain, like, uh, uh, it puts a local anesthesia, local  anesthetic in directly to his wounds so they could start getting him off the morphine.  Nice.  He's going to be a morphine addict.  Can you imagine the governor of Jersey turns out to, it's a, it's a horrible story obviously, 
[00:47:30]  but by the way, I think once you've had morphine once you're a morphine addict, really you've  had it.  Oh, I had it once.  Nice.  Probably the most amazing drug out there.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Can you get that over there?  Like, uh, no, I mean from a pharmacy prescription.  No.  Crazy.  They don't sell them.  You pretty much have to be shot to have it. 
[00:48:00]  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Or you got to like, uh, go diving to find your own staff or fly out of your vehicle  at 90 miles an hour.  Did he fly out?  I didn't have a seatbelt on, so he at least got bounced around pretty good.  Yeah.  The only one, everyone else that was wearing their seatbelt just walked away from the  thing pretty much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  It was like a retarded guy in a van.  Not really.  No, they found the guy.  They found the guy.  They're not charging him because he said he had special needs.  They're not charging him, but you know something?  No, the governor was going 91 miles an hour. 
[00:48:30]  And maybe, and this car obviously probably veered over into whatever lane, uh, the, you  know, the governor was not in and I don't know.  And they said it was a chain reaction.  One guy pulled over and went right off the shoulder of the road, tried to get back on  the highway.  You know, when your wheel slips off the highway into the dirt and then tried to get back.  And when you got back on, he was oversteered.  So we cut across the lanes and, uh, the governor's car was going way too fast to try to try to. 
[00:49:00]  Oh yeah.  But I'll tell you one thing.  I've seen it too many times.  People don't know how to get out of the way of emergency vehicles anymore.  They are clueless as to how to get out of the way of these things.  There is a panic that happened.  Just move over to the right.  Get out of the way.  That's all.  And if you're at a light, if you're at a red light, I've seen this too many times.  You're at a red light and emergency vehicles behind you going,  go through the light.  If you just slowly creep, look both ways, the sirens blast. 
[00:49:30]  And so for the most part, the whole intersection is stopped.  If you're the only guy blocking a fire truck or an emergency vehicle and you're stopped at  a red light, you're not going to get a ticket.  Go through the light.  Let the guy go through.  Right.  They just don't know how to do it.  And I've seen, I'm sorry, I'm going to be politically incorrect here.  I've seen, I've looked, I look when people are making bonehead moves.  I turn and look at the driver and a lot of times it's foreigners.  They don't know the rules, I guess. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Just get out of the way.  All right.  We'll promote NBC a little more when we get back.  Sure.  Brian Williams going over the videotape.  I also want to point out something that came out of 7th.  Oh, that absolutely after the break, Jimmy.  That was something we didn't get to yesterday because we were so busy.  World's upside down.  And also pre-sale tickets.  What's going on with that, Jimmy?  9 a.m., pre-sale for the traveling virus starts today.  And eight or nine comedians that you know and love from the show, 
[00:50:30]  Ant and I, videos, ONA, it's a whole day of festivities, tailgating.  We recommend you tailgate.  Confirmed for the, at least for the Wontosh show, which is in Jones Beach,  June 16th, we've confirmed Stephen Lynch, as well as Bob Kelly, Saget,  Kelly, I know me, Louis C.K., Otto, Patrice, and Wallace.  Okay.  So pre-sale is 9 a.m. this morning.  The rest of the country has access 10 a.m. tomorrow, but you have them 9 a.m.  Pre-sale is really, really good tickets are going on sale today. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, that's right.  And what are the shows real fast?  Just rifle through them there, Jimmy.  June 16 is O'Jones Beach.  Mohegan Sound in Connecticut, June 30th.  The Tweeter Center up near Boston, June 21st.  Detroit, August 4th.  The Nissan Pavilion in Virginia, August 18th.  PNC in Jersey, August 25th.  And the Camden Tweeter Center, September the 15th.  We're like Metallica.  We certainly are.  We're on tour.  But broker.  Right.  Don't buy too many tickets because if this is really successful, then next year we've 
[00:51:30]  got to do like 20 dates.  Yeah.  Last year it was four and it was so successful they moved it up to, it's going to probably  work out to be about 10 dates this summer.  Yeah.  And if these are successful, then we just have to quit the radio show.  Yep.  Because we're going to go on time touring.  We're going to tour on a tour bus.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  All right, let's get right back into this. 
[00:52:00]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Boobie Man from Brooklyn.  Speaking of morphine, my brother burnt his legs up at work.  He was in major pain.  They gave him morphine.  He started wooing like Ric Flair.  Really?  Yeah.  And then this.  This should be said.  Troy from somewhere.  Troy Dixon.  Love you.  Love the show.  I dig the topic.  But every news station would have done the same thing.  Please don't come off like Fox News with a biased response due to recent actions. 
[00:52:30]  With IMA.  CBS would have done the same.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not arguing that.  But I don't want people to think that I'm a dummy.  No, they won the mass murderer lotto is what NBC did.  They sent it.  He sent it to them.  And that's why they did it.  But yeah, any news organization would have done it.  Even CBS.  Our station is owned by CBS.  But please don't come up with all this BS.  You're doing it for ratings.  Yeah.  You're doing it for money. 
[00:53:00]  That's it.  We don't really need to see this manifesto.  Society doesn't really need to see the ramblings of a weirdo who says nothing.  So stop trying to decipher it.  And the Ishmael thing or whatever.  It's the first line of Moby Dick.  End of story.  They're trying to bring like Christianity into it.  And the Muslims and all sorts of other religions.  He was an English major.  Don't try to decipher this kid's ramblings like there's some genius stuff hidden between the lines. 
[00:53:30]  He's awful.  His plays that we read yesterday were awful.  He's childlike, his rival.  Yeah, he's childlike.  He's retarded.  No character development.  He had no social skills, obviously.  He couldn't talk to anybody.  He's a dysfunctional idiot who they're making into some action hero on the news.  Great.  Wonderful.  Hey, we got Bob Saget.  Bob. 
[00:54:00]  God, you forgot he has no chin.  Did he have a weak chin?  No, he does.  He has a very weak chin.  It's a sign of a psychopath, Jim.  I've only seen him from the front.  He looks like Kid Rock from the side.  Yeah, he's very good looking.  Because the hair kind of falls back like a cartoon of a guy on a bike.  We're trying to figure out who will play him in the eight different network movies that will come out about this story.  And it could be anyone from the spiky guy from the X-Men to Pat Morita. 
[00:54:30]  Or isn't he dead?  It could be the little guy from Heroes.  Or, yeah, the guy from Heroes.  I was going to say the Chinese guy, but I don't know if he's Chinese.  That doesn't matter.  He's an Asian gentleman.  I have no idea.  I have no idea what to say anymore.  Two weeks ago, it was all out of Nicole for ten days.  And CNN was equating her to Marilyn Monroe's acting.  So now this is the next wave.  Yeah.  Then there's the Imus thing.  And now this.  It's just big stories. 
[00:55:00]  And in between those stories, we get fed just crap.  We get the crap thing.  But when this happens, the news just comes alive.  They love stuff like this.  Yeah.  It's a shame.  When Walter Matthau dies, people don't celebrate and care and do a week of review.  He's dead?  Yeah.  For many years now.  It's really old news.  I didn't even know.  I didn't either.  Oh, geez.  He was brilliant.  I guess it was just hard for him.  He used to walk by my house with his dog. 
[00:55:30]  And they had cones around their necks because they had dandruff.  Dandruff?  His dogs?  And then he would say to me, do you know where I can get a job?  I said, Walter, you're a big movie star.  Oh, okay.  And then he'd just keep walking his dogs.  He was very nice.  He died of old.  Yeah, he had the old.  He was just old.  Some people just get the old.  Yeah.  Fermented.  It's a ferment.  That's how you go, by the way, when you look at it.  That's such a horrible week.  I was traveling.  I was doing a gig.  Get to the airport.  I go into the bar at the airport because that's where I meet people and really hang with them 
[00:56:00]  and become friends.  I'm looking at the kids just running the massacre on everything.  They've got nine TVs in there.  They're real proud of their flat screens.  And they've got it all yanked up all the way.  And I'm like, I'm going to go wait in the salad plantation or whatever they have outside.  And all that coverage is just a commercial for other weirdos.  You know, when you want your product to get out there, you run a commercial.  They're running commercials for all those weirdos. 
[00:56:30]  God forbid a boob slips out, though, or someone drops an S-bomb or an F-bomb on TV.  That's damaging.  Wow, yeah.  Well, that's weird because I was reading a thing that my publicist sent me that I performed  at Kent State last week.  I had a great time.  It was like 5,000 people.  I got a review that was really nice.  Some guy read it and then compared me to Don Imus and said, because I was a guy on family  television, now all of a sudden I'm dropping the F-bomb over 200 times in one show, which  I think was light for me that night. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not acting it out on stage and I don't look like the Crypt Keeper and I'm not evil.  You know, I want to entertain people.  Yeah, Imus wasn't evil either.  He was a decent guy.  Yeah.  He raised all sorts of money for kids' charities for year after year after year.  And yeah, all the politicians went on his show.  He made a lot of people a lot of money and he entertained a lot of folks.  Yeah, he really wasn't evil.  That's what really is frustrating.  There was no hate behind that dumb comment.  Yeah.  He could be curmudgeonly to some people, but who knows if they weren't? 
[00:57:30]  I know, that was his personality.  He didn't have an agenda.  He used to get beat up more than anyone else on that show.  Yeah.  They used to make fun of him all the time for being senile and slow and boring and all that  crap.  Right.  I feel bad.  I apologize.  I didn't really watch him or listen to him that much.  I didn't live here.  Damn you, Bob.  Bob.  Maybe I should send him a note.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob, you're playing Long Island?  I am.  And it's a Count Basie Theater, which is good, right? 
[00:58:00]  Not from New Jersey, Red Bank.  I did that years ago.  April 19th, Bob, is there.  It's a great theater in Red Bank, which is probably about 45 minutes to an hour.  April 19th.  Tonight?  That is tonight.  Oh.  Oh, I am.  I didn't even realize this tonight.  Are you in town?  Yeah.  I'm here.  I just got here.  I just landed.  I just...  Well, get your ass over to our show.  Why don't you come hang out?  You can buy us breakfast, or we'll buy you breakfast.  We'll all laugh, get to know each other.  I wanted to do that, and you know, I do know you guys pretty well now.  I know where the moles are, and I know...  We're pals. 
[00:58:30]  We are.  I appreciate it, because you guys are cooler than me.  Why don't you come in tomorrow?  Because I have daughter...  My daughter is taking me to show me the places she's been working.  The corners.  Jesus.  What a scumbag.  She wouldn't hear that, right?  Yeah.  The corners.  She shows chestnuts, stopless.  No, that's my kid.  Wait a minute.  Well, tonight is April 9th.  Everybody here tonight is the Cal Basie Theater in the Red Bank. 
[00:59:00]  I didn't realize it was tonight.  I'm an idiot.  Tomorrow is the old Westbury Music Fair, which is called the North Fork Theater, right?  Is that the old Westbury Music Fair?  Yeah, absolutely.  A bunch of us are going tomorrow night.  We'll see a great venue.  Are you coming?  Yeah, I'll be stalking you again, Bob.  Okay, well, we're going to go out afterward, and we're going to do something really fun.  Maybe we'll go over Don Armis' and do some shots.  Nice.  All right.  Talk politically incorrect.  I know.  I'm sorry.  And then Saturday, I'm at the Orpheum.  Great gig in Boston, Massachusetts.  And then the 27th is... 
[00:59:30]  Where the hell is that?  Mortaison Hall in Brushnell Center in Hartford.  Oh, Hartford.  Bushnell, yeah.  Bushnell Center.  Hartford, Connecticut.  That's a speaking engagement.  We're discussing censorship.  But that is the Connecticut Forum.  So that's not actual stand-up, which will be interesting, because hopefully I'll meet  some really cool, great coupon kind of smart people.  Nice.  All right, Bob.  We've got to get back to this subject at hand here.  All right.  We'll talk to you a little more tomorrow, maybe, or maybe you'll just surprise us and 
[01:00:00]  stop by.  Maybe I will do that.  All right.  If I can do that, I will.  And I'll see you tomorrow night.  And thanks, guys.  And all the best.  All right.  Bob, see you soon, man.  Thank you.  See you later.  Bye.  Bob Saget, everyone.  Chris in Boston.  Hey, oh, MSNBC just reported that VT students said they were physically ill by the pictures  and footage they were shown of Cho and said it was like rubbing salt in our wound.  There you go.  There's your integrity.  But what do they know?  There's your integrity.  They're only the kids that were directly involved in the situation.  Yeah.  What do they know? 
[01:00:30]  It doesn't matter how they feel.  As long as you get a few extra people watching your network, make sure you brand your little  label on it so everybody knows it's going to see.  Imagine being this kid.  I read a little article from an eyewitness, one of the students that was in one of the  classrooms.  The gunman bust in.  He busted in this room and just started methodically shooting everybody.  He said it was very slow and calculated.  Like it was rhythmic.  The guy just stood there, bang, bang, bang, shooting everybody. 
[01:01:00]  He laid down on the floor under his desk and completely expected to die there under his  desk.  Then the gunman left the room and he heard these like slow groans from the people that  were shot, some really low crying, no real loud screaming or anything like that.  And he just stayed there and played dead for a little while.  Well, the gunman comes back in the room, reloads and just starts reshooting everyone that was 
[01:01:30]  shot already on the floor to make sure that you aren't playing dead.  Wow.  So the kid is laying there thinking, oh, my God, now I'm going to be killed.  He's going to shoot me.  And he's laying there wondering what what it's going to feel like to be shot, if it's going  to even he's going to die fast or slow.  And he looks kind of open his eyes.  And there was another girl who was playing dead and they locked eyes and kind of looked  at each other with this, oh, my God, can you believe this is happening?  Just keep playing dead.  They didn't say a word to each other, but there was this communication going on just from 
[01:02:00]  their eyes.  And the gunman walked out of the room and then the cops came in and said, everybody, stay  down, stay down.  If you're OK, get up, they said.  And so the girl he was looking at had been shot, but not badly.  And him and that girl were the only two people that stood up, the whole room dead.  And he gets up and walks out of this.  And now he has to look at the guy that did this, probably saw those images in real life 
[01:02:30]  of him holding the guns, pointing them and shooting.  And now he's looking at it with that horror.  And that's not damaging.  And is that a little more disturbing to the participants in this, if I could call them  participants, than a basketball team being called something?  Yeah.  And I hate to even equate the two things.  I really do.  I don't want to, you know, tie the two things together in any way.  One is too much.  It's one is too serious to even be compared to the other.  Yeah.  But to say that, you know, a week ago we were listening to a basketball team that said they 
[01:03:00]  were going to be scarred for the rest of their lives from something that was said.  And please, the coach got a book deal out of it.  And we said it on the air that this was the best thing that ever happened to the Rutgers  women's basketball team.  Now everyone knows who they are and they're going to get all sorts of opportunities because  of what I miss said.  And now we have a news organization showing pictures that will absolutely scar the people  that were involved in this.  They're scarred already.  Right.  But this is, like they said, and this isn't our words, this is coming from the students, 
[01:03:30]  rubbing salt in the wounds.  And by the way, when you were describing that whole scene, which just gave me chills there,  Anthony, this kid obviously studied past school shootings and obviously heard the eyewitnesses  say stuff like, I made believe I was dead and that's the only reason I'm alive today.  I think that's why he came back in the room and started shooting again because it probably  popped in his head like, wait a minute, I don't think I got all those.  Did I get everyone?  I'm hearing some moaning.  I don't think I got all those kids. 
[01:04:00]  I remember like when I was studying this that some of these kids will play dead.  He also said, I heard a lot more shots than there were people in the room.  Right.  The second time.  Well, you know what?  He probably ran out of victims.  Like after a while, people probably hid and he just wanted to keep shooting.  You need to keep shooting people.  Right.  And I don't know why people didn't jump out the window.  They did.  I know, but I mean, once he walks out, I mean, easier said than done.  Maybe you're just too paralyzed.  But Jesus, get out.  And when you hear a slow, like he described it as a slow, methodical shooting, you would 
[01:04:30]  think instead of just hiding under a desk, but you can never think of what you're going  to do in that situation.  Like the old guy that was a concentration, a Holocaust survivor.  He winds up being this huge hero.  He threw himself in front of the door and held the door and told the students to get  out of the classroom any way you can, even if it means the window.  And one of the students said he saw shots coming through the door and going into this 
[01:05:00]  guy in his 70s.  He was being shot and he's still holding the door shut as bullets are whizzing through the  door and going into him.  He's holding this door as long as he could.  Jimmy, before you get to that real fast, Lon, the feedback is just, it's coming in so fast  you can't even keep up.  But Lon from Georgia, the media refuses to show the Twin Tower footage because they say that  it's too hurtful.  Really.  They want people to keep hating the war and not remembering why we're there, but they 
[01:05:30]  show that S, hypocrites.  And you hate, and I don't like seeing the Trade Center footage either until God's honest.  Obviously, but you know, and then we got this from Bill from Long Island.  Here's what makes me sick about you guys meeting us.  Okay.  If that video came to you, you guys would have done the same thing.  Just at least say that you would not have turned that tape over and you would have made  sure your names were on it.  Admit it.  Are you kidding?  On this show, we never try to be something we're not.  That's the point we're making today. 
[01:06:00]  We didn't fire someone under the guise of integrity for our news department and then  do this.  We're dumbbells.  Of course we'd show it.  We probably wouldn't even know what it was.  If it was anything like anything else fans sent me, I would still be sitting on my desk.  Either that or it would be in the garbage pail.  Yeah.  Like when we get, every letter we get, I open, look at it, and throw in the garbage.  We better check our garbage because we do throw out half our mail.  And yeah, we would exploit it for our own needs.  Yes, that's a very honest thing to say.  Not only that, you'd see that stupid Foundry music logo all over the place. 
[01:06:30]  Yes, the flaming Foundry logo.  And then he'd bury it on Foundry.  You wouldn't be able to find it.  You can't find it.  Why are breasts coming up?  I want to mention this.  This is just another example of just how self-centered and disgusting the media is.  Oh, Steve actually did get it, but he thought it was fake.  This is so fake.  It's obviously not real.  Media advisory coverage on Virginia Tech shooting incident.  This is from San Francisco, of course, for immediate release from Janice Lee.  Like the rest of the nation, we at Asian American Journalists Association are stunned at the news of today's shooting. 
[01:07:00]  Our thoughts are with the victims and their families and their friends.  As coverage of the Virginia Tech shooting continues to unfold, AAJA, which is the Asian American Journalists Association,  urges all media to avoid using racial identifiers unless there's a compelling or germane reason.  There's no evidence at this early point that race or ethnicity of the suspected government has anything to do with the incident.  The effect of mentioning race can be powerfully harmful. 
[01:07:30]  It can subject people to unfair treatment based simply on skin color and heritage.  Don't mention the race.  This coming from the Asian American Journalists Association.  And here's who their partners are.  The Unity Journalists of Color, Native American Journalists Association,  National Association of Hispanic Journalists, National Association of Black Journalists.  Every one of these organizations is racially obsessed and cliquish, but don't mention it in connection with the shooting. 
[01:08:00]  Don't mention the race in connection with the shooting.  But absolutely mention it that you're Asian American Journalists.  Why not just American Journalists?  Yeah, why? Exactly.  Why are you putting your race in the name of your organization, yet when something bad happens, you shouldn't put the race in there?  And by the way, wouldn't a journalist of color, wouldn't that cover every journalist on the planet? 
[01:08:30]  Right.  I know we're white.  Why don't you just say all non-white journalists?  We're not even white, though.  Of color.  We're the color of the glowing sun and of goodness.  Why wouldn't they just say non-white journalists?  I'm wearing a white shirt.  My skin is more...  Pink.  Light pink.  We're pink.  People not of the privileged color.  All right.  Hey, phone's next.  The Brian Williams going over the video tapes.  NBC. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  We're doing that sarcastically.  I hope you understand that.  There you go.  It's Opie and...  I'm sorry, man.  I'm saying that they...  A.A.J.A., we've tried to contact them to, of course, ask them about this crap on the air, and they never return the calls.  Yeah, because they think we're just a bunch of shock jocks.  That's too bad.  We do a little more than shock jock stuff.  It's true.  Not much, but a little.  A little more.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:09:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  A.A.J.A.  A.A.J.A.  Sanjaya, you sang, Jesus Take the Wheel.  Randy thought it was a little pitchy.  Paula thought the vocal was overpowered.  Simon thought you and the song were like a hamburger breakfast.  They didn't go together.  Sanjaya, you sang.  Something to talk about.  Randy thought it was too bland.  Paula thought the vocals were off.  Simon thought it was horrendous.  America voted after the biggest top seven vote in Idle history. 
[01:10:00]  Over 38 million votes.  Sanjaya, you are going home tonight.  Finally important news.  That's right.  Howard Stern has no influence.  And the dumb media bought into that one, too. 
[01:10:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's go to Dale in Virginia.  Dale, what's going on today?  Oh, not much, man.  I was just wanting to make a point about the media calling this kid a loser and everything.  He had to deal with that all his life, and his family's got to now listen to it as they've lost a son, too.  Oops.  I mean, he did snap.  I got to admit, he did do wrong.  But nobody's taking their consideration of what they're saying.  Are you kidding me?  Where's the prank in this phone call?  You feel bad for the gunman and his family? 
[01:11:00]  Not him, but his family.  All right.  You've got to be a realist.  The family has some responsibility.  I absolutely don't feel bad for the parents.  We should hang them.  I will say this for them, though.  The court did find this kid mentally ill.  16 months ago, they said he's a danger to himself and others.  Where was the family getting him to help?  I do not feel sorry whatsoever.  I'm sorry.  You just said you're sorry.  Why would you?  And the media, they're such vultures. 
[01:11:30]  There was one of our listeners who brilliantly raised the point that they don't even show somebody running across a baseball field because they don't want to encourage copycats.  And yet they are showing this, knowing that on some level, it is going to contribute to the murder of other students.  But the ratings are more important to them.  And there's a book by Gavin DeBecker called The Gift of Fear.  He's an expert on violence and preventing violence and stalkers.  And he said that the problem is the way the media portrays these guys as these Rambo-type figures, and it encourages other people to do it. 
[01:12:00]  You grab that book.  It's great.  Oh, I agree wholeheartedly.  But, I mean, still, the family's got to deal with this, knowing that they couldn't help their own son.  Oh, well, kill themselves.  Yeah.  They should just kill themselves.  Oh, well.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm not kidding you, man.  I've dealt with depression.  I've been put in a mental hospital.  I mean, I know how.  Ah, okay.  Great.  Then I agree with you wholeheartedly.  Yeah, whatever.  You nutter. 
[01:12:30]  That was Anthony that didn't agree with you.  No, that's not.  Weirdo.  All right, thanks.  The weirdos were calling yesterday.  I'm not going to condemn the family.  They might have been good people.  They might be garbage parents.  You don't know yet.  Sometimes you get good parents and you get a bad child.  Don't care.  Don't care.  Don't want to know anything about them.  Don't care.  Apparently, this kid...  The sooner they die, the happier I'll be.  Don't care.  Apparently, this kid wasn't bullied.  It wasn't a bullying situation.  He separated himself from everybody.  He was one of these, like, recluses. 
[01:13:00]  He just didn't talk to anybody.  Didn't let anybody talk to him or get inside his head.  Yeah, he was...  Some people saw that he had problems and tried to get him help.  Apparently, that didn't work for whatever reasons, whether he didn't get the attention  he needed at mental hospitals or something.  I don't know.  I don't know those circumstances, but I don't think this is a bullying thing.  His roommates tried to talk to him and go out with him and ask him, you know, hey, 
[01:13:30]  what are you up to?  And he would just stare into a wall.  Yeah.  Seems these problems started a little sooner than when he got to college.  The signs are all there.  Where were the parents?  They should have saw the signs.  Hey, see it.  Raul.  They can't open up their eyes.  They should have saw the signs.  Raul.  They can't open up their eyes.  Yeah.  CNN just reported that NBC has involved itself in the story, and they were supposed to interview  families of the victims, but every one of those families canceled their interviews because 
[01:14:00]  they are so angry with NBC's airing.  Good.  Killer.  Backfire on them.  And then you get this coming in from MSNBC themselves.  I hope you're following us today.  If you're just tuning in, wow.  Wow, we've covered a lot already.  But basically, students felt physically sick after seeing shooters' photos and videos.  And this is from MSNBC.  They're reporting this as they're showing the video on MSNBC.  Just how many of these kids who all have their own schedules and things going on, different 
[01:14:30]  lives and things to do, how many of them had seen this air at 630 on NBC and just the immediate  reaction to it?  It seemed like everyone was talking about it.  And some of them were watching in dorms or local restaurants.  Many of them were watching this together, and they said that the reaction was something  between a stunned silence and feeling physically sick.  One young woman who's a freshman described it as just rubbing salt in wounds, plunging  a knife deeper.  One parent we talked to reacted with immediate tears.  Here's just some of what we're hearing out there tonight. 
[01:15:00]  It just seems like he was trying to make it that he had a reason to, which he didn't, which  is just stupid.  But he just wanted to have a reason to, and also for everyone to, he wanted to get his  voice out, and no one wants to listen to him at all.  I just feel like he threw salt on all of our wounds, and I just think the knife was pushed  deeper into the wound, so I think it's going to leave a lasting impression.  Hey, how about the news? 
[01:15:30]  In this day and age, everyone has a video of themselves doing things.  Maybe there are victims of this shooting that have videos of them talking about their hopes  and dreams and what they would have liked to have done.  Where is the news clamoring to get those videos and play some of the people that are victims  of this idiot talking about their life and what they would have liked to have done.  That's too boring.  Ah, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Nah.  Not compelling enough.  This guy is an action hero holding his guns out and standing in front of the camera.  Got a little John Woo to him.  Maybe, you know, the first girl that was killed.  Maybe see pictures of one of her birthdays or something and have her talking with her family.  Nah.  Nah.  Boring.  It's really tough to see this reaction.  I mean, you know that these students in this community have suffered so much, and you go  out there, they're already in mourning, and now this comes out and just adds to it. 
[01:16:30]  I mean, it's a lot for them to have to comprehend and process to hear this person's voice, the  person who did all of this.  What struck them most, many people said, were those photos showing him pointing the gun at  the camera.  You know, of course, the description, the thing that they're left with in their minds is feeling  like that is what the victims saw.  These people who they knew and had class with every day.  And there is anger out there, and there's also sadness.  This is beyond unbelievable.  This is MSNBC.  They were the ones that decided that everyone needs to see the video. 
[01:17:00]  So now their new take is how awful it is to show the video.  And as she does this report, as she does this report, the video is being played when she  describes that they're really disturbed by the shot of the kid with the two guns pointing  basically at the camera.  That's the shot they're showing.  As she describes how bad it was for the kids to see this picture that MSNBC released to the  world.  Holy crap, are we losing our minds?  Than, is that Canoe Lady? 
[01:17:30]  She was on NBC.  She's on NBC, so that's the one with the dignity of the news.  I just wanted to make sure that you knew that all of that, all those pictures of the gunmen  with the, you know, pointing straight at the camera, all of that's being shown on the  screen as she's saying how horrible it is.  And right after the clips they played of the, you know, the students saying that it was  just a knife being plunged deeper into them.  Every two seconds, we got TVs here.  There's not one TV that at one point or another doesn't have his greasy forehead on the screen. 
[01:18:00]  And what did he wash his forehead with?  Baby oil?  He has a greasy headed nothing.  He's a greasy head.  He looks like his breath stinks.  He has an ugly mouth and a weak chin and a greasy forehead.  And that's how he should be painted.  He's a douche.  Our minds is feeling like that is what the victims saw.  These people who they knew and had class with every day.  And there is anger out there.  And there's also sadness.  And you really get both sides of the coin in some ways because you have some students  saying after seeing this, no way could they ever feel any sense of sorrow for this person. 
[01:18:30]  But on the other hand, you have some parents thinking of his parents and his family and  saying they do feel sorry for this person who they say is obviously sick and was in need  of help.  Yeah, that thought will get you far in this world.  Feel sorry for the parents.  Sometimes people want to feel sad.  For you as opposed to anger at you because it's easier to feel sad for someone who's  hurt you like while he was a sicko than to deal with the rage of someone just being  a prick.  You know, you know, some people, though, look at the video like that and it humanizes 
[01:19:00]  the guy like it shows him as a real live person instead of, you know, you look at  the old pictures of what's his name?  Charles Whitman.  Was that his name?  Clock Tower.  The Clock Tower dude.  Yeah.  That's the record that was broken, by the way.  Yeah.  You're keeping track at home because they've told us a million times because now we're keeping  track of this.  Yeah.  It's just like baseball records and, you know, all sorts of sports records.  Now we keep track of this.  So now the number to beat is 32.  But all we have of him is like some grainy black and white pictures. 
[01:19:30]  You can't really get the human element of him.  But this one now, you're watching this lunatic.  You're watching a YouTube video.  Rambling on.  It's a YouTube video.  It is a YouTube video.  We've seen, everyone has seen hundreds of those type of videos.  It's Lonely Guy 15.  You know, those just dumb videos of people talking to the camera.  Yeah.  Just rambling into the camera.  All right.  Hey, let's go to Rachel in Hicksville.  Rachel.  Yes.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good evening.  I'm just going to comment about the caller from Virginia. 
[01:20:00]  I think that in a situation like this, if the family is aware that he is a danger,  they absolutely have a responsibility to let at least the administration of the school know  so that they can handle it however their policy is.  Well, there's a lot of finger pointing that's going to be happening in the coming days because  I guess the school did know.  Apparently, all these stories are coming out of everybody who knew and everybody that heard  that this happened and instantly knew who it was. 
[01:20:30]  I was reading a lot of stories last night that said, the second I heard that, I said,  I know who this is that did this and I'll be surprised if it's somebody else.  I just feel that, you know, the fingers should be pointed because this is just horrifying.  How does this happen when people are aware of the mental status of this guy?  You know, I just don't understand how that can happen and how anybody can just not have  a chain of command when you, and I'm sure he's not the only one on the campus that is 
[01:21:00]  having mental problems.  You know what, though, for every one of these, there's like a crap load of people that are  doing kind of the same thing, acting the same way, going into mental institutions for a while,  getting out, and they don't kill a bunch of people.  So it's kind of hard to pick out the ones that are going to absolutely crack and start  shooting people.  And like it's been said before, you can't just grab somebody and arrest them or keep 
[01:21:30]  them from walking around if they hadn't really done anything yet.  It's unfortunate.  It should be red flagged someplace.  It was red flagged all along.  I mean, people knew that it was going to happen, that something was wrong with them.  But I mean, look, it is kind of, first of all, mass murderers are so rare.  You don't have this happen often.  Yeah.  And you really just can't start arresting people for being nuts.  I mean, there's a lot of nutty people.  Potential mass murderer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's any one of us.  That's why I like when they show them as being human, because these guys are not these 
[01:22:00]  separate entities that we can't comprehend.  They are people that we know.  They're like guys like you and me.  I mean, just kind of lost their minds.  Yeah.  He's a weirdo, and he does a really bad impression of Napoleon Dynamite.  Napoleon Dynamite.  That head is the shiniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.  Let's say hi to Manny in Delaware.  Manny.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know, it's really irresponsible, you know, because you're talking about this kid did 
[01:22:30]  a copycat killing himself.  He praised Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.  I can't remember.  Eric Harris.  Right on the video.  Yeah.  Right on the video.  He praised those guys.  And the media, you know.  How irresponsible is that?  The media made those guys rock stars.  Yep.  They are rock stars to the people out there.  And why was that?  Because the media exploited the hell out of that.  They couldn't get enough info.  Instead of showing them for the dirty little nerds that they were, which is what they were. 
[01:23:00]  They were just greasy, dirty little nerds.  Yeah.  Right.  By the way.  Idiot.  I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way.  Thanks for getting back on the radio.  I missed you guys.  Aw.  Thank you, Manny.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Let's go to Luke in Pittsburgh.  This is a weird angle.  Luke, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Anthony, I wanted to say thank you for finally pointing out that there was no real...  No one really treated this guy badly, it seems, and everything that they brought up. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  It seems like people kind of went out of their way to try to make friends with the guy  or at least carry on a conversation with him, and he just kind of turned his back on them  and never spoke.  And that's what's so just damn odd about this whole thing, is that whenever you have other  instances like this, other shootings with, you know, serial killers and everything, is  that there's always some sort of a spark that seems to set them off that doesn't really  justify their actions, but it gives you some sort of an idea of what was going through  their head.  And there doesn't seem to be that with this guy. 
[01:24:00]  This looks like, the second I watched him rambling in his videos last night, all I could think  of was this sounds like a script to one of his dopey plays.  You know, the plays we read yesterday on the air, it sounds like dialogue from one of those  dopey plays.  And I think he reached that point where the reality and fantasy world in his head kind  of, you know, traded places, and instead of just writing down these morbid kind of empowering 
[01:24:30]  plays, he decided to act one out.  Yeah.  Because it had the, all, it was this overdramatic, like over the top bad dialogue of blaming people  and...  He was, he was looking for some kind of reason, and he just didn't really have a reason.  No, he didn't have a reason.  Like, so he's going to blame...  Eh, it's the rich people.  He's kind of a hack, he's blaming rich people and this and that, he really never had a reason  with your Mercedes and your, uh, uh... 
[01:25:00]  Uh, cognac.  Cognac.  And, uh, and, uh, like he just, he's a hack, he's crazy, that's all it is.  Yes, he's just crazy.  One thing I just don't get is that when you contrast that, his little video that he made  and the scripts that he wrote with what you guys are talking about, the way the media  is portraying him as some sort of a Rambo, is that it makes no sense.  I don't see how other people can actually identify with him at all when they understand  that this guy can't even mail a damn package.  Dude, they, it's the terminology they use. 
[01:25:30]  Like, they, they have things like, manifesto of a madman.  If you want to snap and be empowered because you're picked on, that is a very powerful way  to be portrayed on television.  You pointing two pistols off...  Like an action hero, like we said.  Like an action hero.  Manifesto.  Yeah, it's not a manifesto until you do something like that.  Before that, it's your stupid home movies and your rambling writing.  The writings of a little, nothing, douchey kid. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, an immature moron.  Just a kid who couldn't get laid, who couldn't meet chicks, he had no social skills, he was  a little bored, he stared at the wall, that's what he was.  And all of a sudden it becomes a manifesto.  Yeah, like this powerful thing that this madman has released.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Just the ramblings of a weirdo.  Exactly.  Manifesto makes it sound cool.  Yeah, but it's turned into a manifesto when you kill a bunch of people.  So someone that's on the edge goes, you know, hey, I have my life, no one seems to care about 
[01:26:30]  it, but if I videotape it and write down my ideas and then kill people, it becomes this  important historic documentation of who I was.  I should start out by a couple of points, and the first one should be obvious, and that  is no joy in this.  This was a sick business having to look through this, to read through it, to see the videos,  the still pictures, and to realize what this meant.  Did he say no joy in this before he showed it?  Do they say that when they show war footage? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, how about that?  They are so guilty, and you never hear reporters justifying why they're giving you news.  Yeah.  Unless it's not real news, it's just sensationalist get us ratings.  Yeah.  They know what they're doing.  They are prefacing this every time they play it with some type of justification and trying  their best to let people know, hey, this is good, don't worry, now we're doing the  right thing here. 
[01:27:30]  No one thing, if you're hearing our voices today, the media lies to you on a regular  basis.  The media lies to you.  I mean, they have been for years.  We never try to be something we're not on this radio show.  Look, we'll exploit stuff to get ratings, absolutely, to get our names out there, yes, of course.  We're not going to sit there and go, well, we had to do this with this person because  we wanted to make a social statement about blah, blah, blah.  No, we do some crazy shocking things to get our names out there and to get ratings, absolutely.  The news does the exact same thing, but they'll never, never, ever admit that to you, ever. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, day travel, virus, comedy, tour, info, pre-sale starts in what, an hour, Jimmy?  It actually starts in an hour, 9 a.m.  at Ticketmaster.  Jones Beach, June the 16th.  The lineup is unbelievable.  We did get Stephen Lynch for that one, by the way.  Right.  And Otto and Louis C.K., who I believe is here today, and myself and Bob Saget.  Mohegan Sun, June 30th in Connecticut. 
[01:28:30]  Tweeter Center in Massachusetts is June 21st.  Pavilion in Detroit is August 4th.  Pavilion in Virginia, August 18th.  PNC, August 25th.  And the Tweeter Center in Camden, September the 15th.  Great lineups for all these shows, man.  And tickets, some tickets will be on sale today at 9 a.m.  They're actually releasing really good seats at 9 a.m. for some reason.  I don't know what a pre-sale does, but that's why they do it.  And then tomorrow morning is the actual on sale everywhere.  I think it's so the true fans of the show really have a shot at it. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  Because this info is not really out there, I think.  I don't know.  I don't really know how it works, but I know it just gives the hardcore fans a chance to get the better seats.  Well, basically, a lot of comics on the show draw from other places other than just Opie and Anthony.  I mean, Caliendo has a fan base.  Lynch, obviously, has a fan base.  We all have a certain – mine is almost predominantly Opie and Anthony.  But a lot of these guys have an outside fan base.  Louie does, too, just from the show.  People don't even know him from O&A.  So this gives O&A fans a chance to get the tickets first before other people's other parts of their fan base get tickets. 
[01:29:30]  That's the advantage to buying them.  Because it really is an Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  All right.  Look, everyone calling like crazy.  Just get to your point really fast.  We want to get a lot of callers on between now and 9 o'clock.  Also, the Brian Williams going over the videotape.  We're going to try to get some of that on the radio.  And Louis C.K. is joining the program next as well.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:30:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We should demand that Steve Kappas gets fired.  We should demand it.  Now he's going on TV to try to explain why he decided that everyone needed to see these video clips from this weirdo.  You know something?  I'll even give him that. 
[01:30:30]  I will even give him that it's a marginal morality kind of call whether to air it.  But the fact that he opened up a package that contains something that could be used in an ongoing federal investigation of the murder of, you know, 30 people, 31 people and himself is ridiculous.  They got tampered with evidence.  They knew it was from this guy before they opened it, yet they decided to open it with NBC security there. 
[01:31:00]  That must be good.  Yeah, those guys.  That must be good.  The same people that make sure Don Pardo gets upstairs in the elevator.  What is NBC security doing?  Do they know how to handle that?  Rachel Dretsch's escort.  Yeah.  Sorry, I've got to open up this package from this.  They were assisted by NBC pages that helped them open this package.  The pages of NBC are actually a branch of the Treasury Department. 
[01:31:30]  Right, right.  ATF, I think.  Let me introduce everybody.  Louis C.K. has joined the Opinion Athlete Show.  Louis C.K., always a pleasure to have Louis on the show.  Playing Carolines all weekend?  All weekend, next weekend.  This weekend I'm in Atlanta at the Punchline and this coming weekend.  You know what I noticed about Atlanta?  It's a huge XM market for us.  Yeah.  I noticed that.  For some reason, they love this show in Atlanta on XM.  Because we're not on a regular station down there.  It's a dirty town.  My tickets down there go like flapjacks.  Do they go like flapjacks?  That's a wonderful way to put it. 
[01:32:00]  So Atlanta this weekend.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Caroline's in New York next weekend.  That's right, next weekend.  Caroline's all weekend.  All right, so what do you think about this whole thing?  This is obviously the only thing to talk about.  Well, I was telling Anthony, like, it's all made me really sick.  And even the kid doing the shooting is, like, the least sickening part of it at this point.  It's like, yeah, some kids are dead.  But what the media is doing, it really is more.  That's the most outrageous, sick part of it.  Because the other thing is yesterday's news.  John Hinckley was on the cover of People for shooting John Lennon.  That's how far back it goes.  If you kill somebody, you're on the news. 
[01:32:30]  You mean Hinckley for Reagan or Chapman for Leighton?  Did I screw it up?  Yes, you did.  You took one of them.  Everyone does that.  You crissed off your murderers.  Well, everyone does that because they were so close together.  Lennon and Ronald Reagan were very much alike.  Politically, yes.  Yes, they were very, you know.  Yeah.  Nobody told me there'd be days like these.  Will.  Oh, my God.  Imagine all the people.  Imagine him.  Living life in peace. 
[01:33:00]  Mommy.  Was he really for peace?  Did you ever want to get into it?  Faux pas.  The bombing starts in five minutes.  Just talking about the Russians who have missiles pointed towards us, too.  This is on what?  Yeah, hello.  Testing.  What happened?  That was when Reagan was before.  He was doing a sound check on the radio.  Press conference, yeah.  First fire, side chat or whatever.  Yeah.  They were getting a mic level.  And he went to one, two.  They said, can we get a level from you, Mr. President? 
[01:33:30]  He said, one, two, the missiles are flying.  We're bombing Russia.  Yeah.  I was joking.  The bombing starts in five minutes.  It wasn't on the air.  It was a joke he made to the engineers, and someone said, oh, and they made a stink.  That's a good one.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll hurry it on the phone.  Steve Kappas.  Yeah, we got to get that audio.  We'll have it in a few minutes.  So, but the thing is, well, first of all, I see the kid.  I haven't heard, I haven't seen the thing I just saw on the cover of the newspaper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a boring loser.  That's right.  Like, even now, with the shooting, even if I met him, if he came back from suicide, I'd 
[01:34:00]  be like, yo, what's up?  We're talking.  Yeah.  I'd still shun him.  We're busy over here.  Yeah.  Just a nerd bummer.  Yeah.  He had nothing to say in this, what they're now calling his manifesto, his multimedia manifesto.  Yeah.  Which, until you kill someone and then kill yourself, it's your YouTube videos, your blog,  and your MySpace page. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  That is just boring as hell.  But then once you kill a bunch of people and yourself, it becomes a video multimedia manifesto.  Yeah.  He felt invisible.  Well, he's still in now.  He's really invisible.  Yes.  He's dead.  You won't be seeing him no more.  He sent a press kit.  He won't be seeing him no more.  Headshot.  And he sent out a press kit.  Well, well, put together.  That's what they said.  Quotes about him.  It's a press kit.  Well, you want to get into it.  This is how it all went down last night, you know, on NBC. 
[01:35:00]  Ah, yes.  No, but then there's all these roadside bombs in Iraq.  People die there by the thousands.  And there's no, like, loving testimony about each victim in Iraq with piano playing behind it.  Yeah, with the nice music playing in the background.  A bad American mother crying about it.  No, it's not even nice music.  It's like that morbid, like, creepy over the top.  Good evening.  We now know what the Virginia Tech gunman was doing during that two-hour period between shootings on campus. 
[01:35:30]  He was compiling, before going to the post office and mailing via overnight mail,  what can only be described as a multimedia manifesto containing video...  Only be described a couple of ways.  ...to NBC headquarters...  No, only.  ...the very building here in New York.  Um, he actually said that on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  It can only be described...  What can only be described...  Oh, excuse me.  There's a few other ways to describe that.  Uh, the ramblings of an idiot and loser. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  How about a bunch of videos and pics?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's not like it's, it's like 1970, where it's like, wow, this guy's got video, what  is that stuff?  Video of himself?  What is video?  Anyone can take their phone now and make a manifesto.  Yes.  You know, it's not like there's, wow, he got video.  We got PalTalk cameras on right now.  Yeah.  I guess we're doing a manifesto as we speak.  This is the Opie and Anthony manifest show. 
[01:36:30]  That's what we're calling it.  The manifest show.  Nice.  What is a manifesto?  Can we look that up directly?  Because they always credit some ass, like Ted Kaczynski.  Yeah.  He had a manifesto.  He's another rambling douche.  Can you imagine, though, he goes to the post office?  Yeah.  In between?  Maybe he was just going to only kill those two people, and then he got so frustrated  at the post office to decide, oh my God.  I like that.  I got to lose my mind now.  Yeah.  He had to go to the post office to mail the thing in between.  I like that he had to be at the post office and have polite discourse with some, 
[01:37:00]  you know, next.  Oh, thank you.  How you doing?  You have to look, make sure you had a 10.  Did I have the right label for press mail?  There's confusion.  It's like, oh, I think you were before me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Exactly.  Do you have the zip code?  Actually, no.  No problem.  I can look it up.  Oh, okay.  Oh, thanks.  I'll look at it.  We were talking about it during commercials that, like, maybe his intention was to just  kill the initial people at the first building.  Right.  But he got so pissed at the post office.  So frustrating.  Like, waiting online.  There was probably somebody that was online in front of him that just was asking stupid 
[01:37:30]  questions.  And he's like, oh, my God.  And he's like, come on.  Now I'm really pissed.  Either that or he killed the first couple of people and then watched the news and was  like, oh, this ain't happening.  Yeah.  I'm going to go out and do some more.  Damn it.  Oh, wow.  I really want to pick up on this already.  Multi-media manifesto.  The envelope was sent from Blacksburg, Virginia on Monday morning.  And looking at a copy, you can even see the handwriting of the clerk checking it in at 9.01 a.m. 
[01:38:00]  But because the gentleman had the wrong zip code and there are three different scratched  out attempts at it, along with Rockefeller Avenue and not Rockefeller Plaza in New York,  the zip code had to be corrected.  And it didn't arrive here.  Doesn't he watch Tina Fey's show?  Come on.  Right?  Watch Tina Fey's show.  Send it there.  Yeah.  He can't find it.  He's always looking for 30 lock.  Wow.  Oh, God.  They're, uh.  Honey, lock off and a son-up.  Anyone else notice of their day? 
[01:38:30]  Lock off and a son-up.  They're explaining this way too much.  Yeah.  Like, they're trying to cover their ass.  Like, look, a lot of people think we might have had this package the day before.  But look, it got the address wrong and the zip wrong.  Yeah.  It's like a guy trying to explain why there's a gun in his bag.  I was just, it was put right in my bag.  I had nothing.  Look.  I had no choice.  Aye.  That was not my marijuana.  Here's your manifesto definition.  A public declaration of intentions, opinions, objectives, or motives as one issued by a government, 
[01:39:00]  sovereign, or organization.  The manifesto.  A lot of, yeah, countries put out a manifesto.  We have to get our motives and our intentions.  Okay.  When I am done with this show today, I am going to go home and try to receive treats from  my girlfriend, Orly.  That is a manifesto.  Why?  Because I want them.  You got something festering in your, uh...  Your manhood manifesto.  Code had to be corrected. 
[01:39:30]  And it didn't arrive here until today.  An alert New York City Postal Service employee spotted the return address, and he spotted  the return address name Ishmael and brought it to our attention by hand.  That postal guy was pretty good.  You know, actually looking at the return address, realizing, yeah, you know, this is from the  same place, but it's Ishmael.  Oh, I kind of remember them saying something about that.  Ishmael.  He's well read. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, do you need a password for the pre-sale?  Um, Ryan, Long Island, go.  Hey, how you doing, Owen?  Hey, you guys didn't mention any sort of password, and you need one for the pre-sale when it starts.  Manifesto.  Hold on.  That's just wonderful.  That's his manifesto.  It's not on...  That's why he's going to go kill somebody.  Yeah, he did not issue any sort of a password.  Password.  All right, keep listening to the radio.  Pre-sale starts at 9.  He might have told me what it was.  If we need a password, we'll find it out immediately.  You who did not issue a password.  Uh, here we go. 
[01:40:30]  William says the first thing they did was call authorities.  Then made...  They were sensitive.  What?  Then made copies?  I don't know.  When the package arrived on the desk of our news division president today, the first thing we did was call federal authorities.  Ah, they're coming their ass, yeah.  Tonight, they have the original envelope.  This one we've been showing you is a color copy.  We have been pouring over a copy of the contents we made.  It has taken hours, and we are still going through it.  We are sensitive to how all of this will be seen by those affected, and we know we are, in effect, airing the words of a murderer here tonight. 
[01:41:00]  But you can't just say, we are sensitive, and then go do it.  And then do it.  Airing it.  Yeah, you can't.  That's like a guy raping a girl and giving domestic violence stats.  How amazing would it have been if that dude, if the guy we're listening to said, we are sensitive to how this will affect you, so we're not going to show it to you.  Anyway, we just want to let you know we have it.  It's amazing.  We made a decision. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  It'll end up limited.  It's going to be on YouTube anyway.  So if you want to see it, just search it on YouTube.  That's the same crap like when you do wrong, and you go, ah, I take full responsibility.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  You know, it's like a John Rocker style of apology, like, if you were offended because  you're stupid, even though you're wrong, I'm sorry, because my lawyer made me be sorry.  It's pointless.  Exactly.  How great would it be if he sent it to NBC, and he kept citing the reasons for these murders  as how awful NBC television sitcoms had become, and there's not a laugh to be had. 
[01:42:00]  I had to kill people.  NBC is so bad.  It's so unfun.  Do you think they still would have aired it?  They'd have played it, yeah, sure.  All the other networks would have.  They might have paraphrased it.  When the time came, I did it.  Oh, yeah, now we get to listen to it.  I have not heard his voice yet.  Now we get Napoleon Dynamite.  Yeah, now we get to listen to Napoleon Dynamite.  Oh, you idiot.  When the time came, I did it.  Nerd.  I had to. 
[01:42:30]  In a separate written document, he includes 29 photos he apparently took of himself.  He looks like a normal, smiling college student.  What a greasy head.  Two.  In the rest, he presents the stern face and strikes the pose that was very likely what  his victims saw later on.  No, it wasn't.  In 11 of the pictures, he aims handguns at the camera, likely the very ones he bought  in the past two months.  They're making it like this is like a cowboy comic book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that's what they're doing.  Just like Jesse James was probably a fat nerd who awkwardly quit. 
[01:43:00]  When he pulled the trigger, he cringed and made all sorts of gay faces.  Probably had really bad B.O.  Yeah.  Swamp ass.  But they show him with a chiseled face on the cover of a comic book and then kids end  up being cowboys.  It's the same thing here.  Yeah.  The grimace and the pointing.  No.  When he was shooting the kids, he was probably blinking a lot and probably peed in his own  pants.  Made a stupid face like a guitarist doing a real hard guitar lead.  Yes.  You know, when I was a kid, I idolized Jesse James. 
[01:43:30]  But then someone told me that his grandfather had been shot by Jesse James.  Jesse James shot my grandfather.  And then I had the same thing happen.  I had a nightmare that I was on a train with my family.  And Jesse James came in and I was all psyched to see him.  But then he started shooting my family.  Yeah.  And wasn't the weird part about the dream that the set looked like it was probably right  next to the house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was.  It was weird.  Even though it was the old man.  Lit the same. 
[01:44:00]  And the music was kind of written by the same guy that wrote some, I don't know, poppy kind  of song.  And then I wasn't sure what was happening.  But for some reason, my father had fallen with his face on the pillow and Jesse James was  behind him grabbing his hips and trying to hook him up.  Weird.  Holstering the old pistol.  Yes.  And he fired bullets at my father all over his back.  Oh, my goodness.  And then, I don't know why, but Jesse James was afraid to get dad's blood on him. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  Hey, listen.  Well, the actions could have been avoided.  Here's more of Napoleon Dynamite.  You had a hundred billion chances in the ways to have avoided today, but you decided to  spill my blood.  You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option.  Took my tots.  Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.  Much of it is incoherent, laced with profanity.  He rails against hedonism and Christianity. 
[01:45:00]  You just loved crucifying me.  You loved inducing cancer in my head, terrorizing my heart, and ripping my soul all this time.  That's not really going to go into reality.  He could have the worst voice I've ever heard.  It's the worst voice I've ever heard.  He should do voiceovers for diarrhea.  Idiot.  You mean, like, commercials that are, like, for diarrhea?  Like, not to stop diarrhea, but...  Yeah, yeah.  Diarrhea.  It's a pro-diarrhea commercial.  That's what he's doing. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  You want to have diarrhea.  What's better than just diarrhea?  Give me cancer in my brain.  Pain in my heart.  Ugh.  And he said, you had, right in the beginning of that, he says, you had hundreds of millions  of chances of ways.  A hundred trillion gazillion ways.  Stop us, but...  I blame the ligers.  You guys are dicks.  That's like Tara Lee.  Oh my God, guys.  I'm so angry with you.  Yeah.  A hundred billion gazillion ways. 
[01:46:00]  But that's not a real number, Tara.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  But this is news.  You couldn't stop it.  That's the thing is, the serious, what makes it offensive is the dude talking over it and...  Oh, yeah.  We had to show you this.  Yes.  We couldn't just tell you what was in it.  I just hope we're getting smarter out there.  You know, they're obviously lying to us.  You know, I hope we're becoming more media savvy.  They did it for the ratings and for the money that it will generate, and they should admit  that openly.  It's true.  The problem is that nobody watches something less because they think it's reprehensible. 
[01:46:30]  You know what I mean?  No.  We as a people love reprehensible stuff.  Yeah.  Well, why do people think in such a short period of time, you know, relatively speaking,  and we've heard this thousands of times, we've been on this planet for a very short period  of time.  I don't know why humans feel that we can evolve so quickly.  You know, it was a nothing.  It was such a small amount of time between the gladiators killing each other for amusement  in the Coliseum.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  On the whole global timeline, the snap of a finger.  It's not even that.  Yeah.  It's nothing.  It's not even this.  Why do people think, because we learned how to build cool things, that in our heads, we're  not the same people that kind of dig watching atrocities and just horrible things.  Well, I'm amazed.  Still, every day when I just look at traffic on a highway flowing smoothly, I'm amazed that  people aren't just stopping their cars and killing and raping everyone around them.  And the only reason they're not...  You're right. 
[01:47:30]  You're right.  I'm amazed that everyone doesn't do that all the time.  The only reason they're not is because they're late for something.  That's it.  Like, they have to be somewhere.  Yes.  If people didn't have jobs...  Yes.  Like, jobs is a way to keep this planet from just ending up with people ripping each other's  clothing off, raping, killing...  The entire fabric of society is a distraction.  Because in reality, what do you need a job for?  To get money, to get food.  You could grow food right outside your door and buy a cow and drink the milk and then eat  it later.  But we make this... 
[01:48:00]  We put it in another place where you have to get...  Just so that...  First of all, so guys can get out of their houses and not listen to their ugly, stupid  wives.  And also, everybody's wife is stupid and ugly.  And so that people won't kill each other.  Do you think deep down we secretly wish for stuff like this to happen?  Yes.  Of course.  Is there some kind of excitement that we feel?  Dude, my...  Absolutely.  I've told you of my dream all the time.  It is to be around for the complete apocalypse of the world. 
[01:48:30]  Totally.  I want to be around and just watch either the meteor hit or just a complete meltdown of  all society where it's complete anarchy, nothing but gunfire and bombs outside.  I want an alien invasion.  Alien invasion would be another great one.  Yeah, nuclear...  That's just hack.  I want, like, alien...  Oh, you want something that's, like, amazing?  Way out there.  Even though the movie sucked, War of the Worlds all the way.  Oh, totally.  Where you just realize, wow, wow, we have no chance against this whatsoever. 
[01:49:00]  Great.  You can't make phone calls and make some crazy last-minute deal with a country.  No, you don't even know how...  You don't even know their language.  No.  When Katrina...  When they started making warnings about Katrina, I've got to say, there was at least 4%  of the economy that was going, come on, come on, come on.  Come on, Levy.  Let's see it.  Don't hold.  People are like, you're crazy to say that, but I think secretly we all have that deep  inside us.  Like, why do you think people watch the news so much like that?  When there's big stories, the ratings go up on the news. 
[01:49:30]  What are they watching it for?  Hoping, oh, please solve this and get it off the air so I don't have to see it anymore?  When the guy got that envelope, after he, you know, pulled down his pants and did what  he obviously did, immediately to relieve himself of the anxiety he was feeling, he gathered  people together and they said, okay, what if we release this?  What happens?  Well, people will be really upset, and then somebody else said, but will they watch us  last night?  Nope.  Nope.  Put it out.  It's on.  Full speed ahead.  They don't even have that conversation. 
[01:50:00]  It's just...  Yeah, it's a reflex.  When I got home from doing some errands and I turned on the TV and saw this was going  down, in my brain, I'm like, cool.  Like, wow, there's more to this story?  Yeah.  And then, like, I'm going to go home today and I'm going to hope there's going to be  another tidbit that comes out.  That's why...  I mean, I feel...  You know, I hope we don't have to say this, but of course we feel bad for the victims  and all their families and all that, but as far as a viewer and living through this,  when you hear that there's a new tidbit, you're running right to the TV.  It doesn't even have anything to do with the actual tragedy. 
[01:50:30]  No.  What it is, is we...  How can we look at things like curse words being offensive and let's not offend people  on their race and stuff when we are still so uncivilized mentally and with our own instincts  that we enjoy watching suffering and crime and murder.  Yeah, but Janet Jackson's boob and...  Yeah, but that's the stuff that we got.  That's the worst thing that happened in American history in the last decade. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  I mean, that changed the world.  Yeah, the boobie slip.  Yeah, that changed the world.  Come on.  With a star over the nipples.  Speaking on a bizarro planet.  Speaking of disasters, could someone get USA Today from yesterday?  Oh, I thought you needed Iraq.  He's right there.  It was really interesting.  On the front page of the life section, they said, if you're 21 years or older, they were  mostly focusing on a 21-year-old, which would be a senior in college.  They listed all the stuff they've lived through so far, and it's beyond amazing. 
[01:51:30]  When we turned 21, there wasn't this many things.  Right.  Just over-the-top events that have occurred, and they listed all of them.  I want to...  Well, it's open for debate.  You know what?  It's like when I was a kid, and I used to fantasize that my parents would die.  I wanted them to die so that I could go to school and have the teacher really focus on  me and say, you know, we'll do whatever you need.  Oh, my God.  So I could have a press conference with my friends.  All the kids that didn't pay attention to me would...  Some girl I don't know would cry for me. 
[01:52:00]  Like, I used to pray.  You're lucky your parents didn't die, because you know...  I'd be living with that.  But then my wish would have come true.  And I would have realized things I wish happened.  Oh, wow.  Press conference.  All right.  We got a break.  We got Louis C.K. in studio.  He's playing Atlanta this weekend.  Where's the club in Atlanta?  I still hope that.  Louis, let's go.  I think Lee's got a stripper to screw me from my parents' time.  Atlanta, the punchline in Atlanta.  This weekend, and then Caroline's next weekend.  Next weekend.  Here in New York City.  Highly recommend.  And you're going to be part of the O&A Traveling Virus College. 
[01:52:30]  I am.  I'm going all over the place with you guys.  With pre-sale tickets starting at 9 a.m.  You might need a pass.  I don't think you do, Pete said.  We don't have to go through a website, right?  Are we going to go to Ticketmaster?  No.  No.  No password, Kenny?  No.  You got to go through a website, a link?  Oh, boy.  We're not organized once again.  What do we need to tell the people?  We got a half hour.  9 o'clock.  You have to go on the website that you can't mention.  Our website?  Yeah.  Okay.  Or you can go to your myspace.com slash virus tour or myspace.com slash Opie and Anthony and 
[01:53:00]  click on the pre-sale link.  That's the only way you can get these special tickets for the special O&A fans.  We're finally getting that info out.  We've been promoting the pre-sale for the last three days.  Why was nobody telling me this while I was announcing this for the last three days?  No one told me that you had to do that until a listener just called in.  Because it's really just a show and some radio.  It's not like, what are you, the president?  Well, I should have been, why wasn't I told?  Nobody told me.  It's a matter of national security.  You know what?  Tickets go on sale tomorrow morning. 
[01:53:30]  Get Khrushchev on the phone.  You're a marginal human.  That's why.  No, but Lou, I have got a lot of importance.  I have value.  Not so much.  We got a break.  We got a break.  We got more audio from Napoleon Dynamite slash the killer, the shooter, whatever the hell  you want to call this weirdo.  More with Louis C.K. and blah, blah, blah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Once again, Jimmy, pre-sale tickets are happening very soon and there was some confusion with 
[01:54:00]  the info, so.  They start today at 9 a.m.  Are we allowed to see the website?  The name of the show, website.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony, you know what had to do.  And you have to click on the pre-sale banner to purchase tickets.  I know this is the first you guys are hearing it.  I wasn't aware of it.  So, tickets are limited.  And it features wrote in parentheses, this is true and not me trying to hype the pre-sale.  There might be 500 in every market going on sale today.  They're really good tickets. 
[01:54:30]  So, go to our website and click on the pre-sale banner.  And I'm sorry I didn't tell you that sooner.  I've been plugging this all week, but I did not know it.  Yeah, I was confused about, well, pre-sale, anyone can find the pre-sale info, but now  it makes sense.  You had to go to our website to get the password and all that, to get these special tickets  before they go on sale tomorrow.  Hey, from the USA Today life section, yesterday.  So, all in their lifetime, from 1986 to the present, this is what these kids that are now  seniors in high school. 
[01:55:00]  People that are 20.  21.  21.  This is what they've lived through.  Pretty much their seniors.  Yeah, this is what they've lived through.  They were alive for the shuttle blast back in 86.  21 or under, you said, not 21 or over.  From 1986 to present.  All in their lifetime.  So, 21 years.  If you're 21 or older, you've lived through all these events.  Obviously, if you're in your 40s, you've lived through a few more.  But just 21 years old, you were alive for the space shuttle explosion, the first one.  Waco, Texas, Oklahoma City bombing, Olympic bombing, Columbine, of course, the terrorist 
[01:55:30]  attacks on 9-11, the Columbia explosion, excuse me, the tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and  now, of course, the daily shooting in U.S. history.  Did they mention the United States Center?  And millions of other things, too.  AIDS.  AIDS wasn't around before.  No.  The AIDS.  The middle of the 80s.  I was here for the AIDS.  The AIDS.  I remember the AIDS.  93, 1993, Trade Center bombing.  Yeah, but, I mean, come on.  If you want to do that, how about the Cuban Missile Crisis? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we were alive when they basically said the world made it.  The world pretty much.  You watch shows on the Cuban Missile Crisis now, you realize, oh, the missiles were in  the air.  We actually had to pull them down by the fins.  Yeah.  It was that close.  Like, that's how close we were to wiping out everybody on the planet.  And back then, it was just like, ah, everything's in hand.  Don't worry, Kennedy has everything.  They're talking with Khrushchev now.  And they had to use, like, old phones and stuff to communicate with each other.  So, it was really close. 
[01:56:30]  It wasn't like you could send a quick text message to go, hold on, hold on.  Let's talk a little more about this.  Like those commercials about dropouts that could have happened easily.  Yeah.  Mr. Khrushchev, I need an answer from you now.  Silence.  All right.  Well, the missiles are coming, my friend.  All right.  We're launching.  I love those commercials, by the way.  They're pretty good.  They're really good.  We've all been there.  Yep.  We've got that.  Okay.  I don't know.  Are we just looking at bad things?  Yeah, for the most part.  Yeah.  What about the flower festival of 68?  That was, you know. 
[01:57:00]  That was pretty bad.  Yeah.  We have Watergate.  The giant puffy bear that snuggled with a monkey.  They lived through that.  Watergate.  Chernobyl.  Vietnam War.  Yeah, the whole Vietnam War was thrown in there.  Baby Jessica.  Jesus.  O.J.  Yes.  O.J.  Well, we were a little older for that.  I didn't know.  I'm trying to think of when I was 21.  Screw it.  You get the point.  We've got to get more of the Napoleon Dynamite dudes audio on the air here. 
[01:57:30]  And don't say when I was 21, Hiroshima, you bastards.  I was going to go with an Abe Lincoln joke.  Really go.  I was just going to.  You're going to really take the exaggeration further.  I'm a fan of exaggerated humor.  That's good.  Actually, I'm not.  I think it's awful.  Why?  I said something like when I was a kid, Christ was still an apprentice.  I didn't have to do this.  I could have left.  I could have fled.  Jesus. 
[01:58:00]  But no.  I will no longer run.  It's not for me.  It's for my children.  For my brothers and sisters.  That you f***.  I did it for them.  Coward.  What is Nicolas Cage talking about?  Yeah.  He's overdramatic.  If you're going to kill people and then manifesto his eyes, just enunciate.  Yeah.  Just be clear.  Don't make people strange.  Find a proofreader, too.  Yeah.  It might help you a little bit. 
[01:58:30]  Or be funny.  How great would it be if there was no doing it?  If he was hilarious.  Like the king of comedy.  And if he was like, I hate to do this, but so many shoes do not match pants, and just  went on this silly rant.  Oh, my God.  Where you go, girl, and he was high-fiving someone who wasn't there.  That would be.  That could only be described as, I'm sorry, but it is hilarious.  That would be so creepy, man.  It could only be described as a hoot.  Just gives an Opie laugh.  You would have a lot of Beavis and Butthead faces on the news, like, uh. 
[01:59:00]  He did impressions, but it was like really bad impressions of Christopher Walken.  Or Arnold Schwarzenegger, the one every comedian does.  I'm the Terminator.  Yeah, that would be awful.  Then would they air it?  If he was being, like, funny?  I don't know.  How would they, what would the angle be there?  His laugh-a-festo.  Let's get more here.  You sadistic stars.  I may be nothing but a piece of the ****.  You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul, and torched my conscience. 
[01:59:30]  Ew.  You thought it was one pathetic, bored life you were extinguishing.  Thanks to you, I die, like Jesus Christ, to inspire generations of the weak and the defenseless people.  He was probably pissed because his time machine didn't work.  Yeah.  God.  Jesus.  Oh, freaking idiot.  You know, another thing that annoyed the hell out of me when I saw this clip is, uh,  it's offensive because it's a murderer, uh, being given, um, a forum on all the channels 
[02:00:00]  to discuss his lunacy after he's killed, uh, 32 people.  Um, and, and, and they bleep out the curse word.  Like that's the part of it.  let anyone hear the, yeah, the brown word.  Yeah.  Again, again, that's the part of it that they deem unahirable.  Like, well, we, all this is, but, Jesus, he said the S word.  It's like when you see Blazing Saddles on TBS.  tbs yeah and they they actually take out the fart scene they take it out you will be the fart scene 
[02:00:30]  but he they say nigger about forty thousand times yeah yeah they leave it in they leave it in and  blame the saddle but the purpose of bleeping is to save people from being offended offended right  maybe reverend al is on onto something he's basically telling that we basically are telling  america that a fart scene is not okay but saying the n-word is that's horrible wow he might have a  point yeah in that case it's just like how do you play this guy who just i mean really just killed 
[02:01:00]  so many young people and actually completely curse word completely uh fulfilling what he wanted  making it clear to everybody in the world that uh this works every time yeah if you kill people  whatever drivel yeah it'll be all over great if somehow it went back to his parents or something  with just a form letter we appreciate your uh nbc uh has looked over your materials we find that  they're not worthy of broadcast we do not accept unsolicited material wasn't in the wrong format 
[02:01:30]  it's not hd television it's not up to industry standards if i shot something like this and tried  to get it on the air forget it there's no way that i could get just based on how he shot it it's out of  focus it's it's bleeding uh uh you know white yeah he didn't white balance it he didn't white balance  it's terrible hey uh rob bartley wants to check in say hi rob uh we got uh here's where he blames  it on basically rap videos i'll make it i'll make that connection okay because he's talking about 
[02:02:00]  the kanya the coloniac and the mercedes and the rich people oh you think that's who he was talking  about yeah he liked rap videos let's get right into it wasn't he talking about the kids  yeah i think so  do you know what it feels like to dig your own grave do you know what it feels like to have  your throat smashed from ear to ear do you know what it feels like to be torched alive  do you know what it feels like to listen to this  no and neither do you you stupid 
[02:02:30]  did you want to inject as much misery in our lives as you can just because you can you had  everything you wanted your mercedes wasn't enough you brats your golden necklaces weren't  enough you snobs your trust fund wasn't enough your vodka and cognac weren't enough all your  devaluaries weren't enough news weren't enough to fulfill your heathenistic needs you've had  everything somewhere in his brain he had to go yeah i think i finally got it yeah i think i got 
[02:03:00]  my mission statement all right one take that was good that was good a few other takes like oh i did  it yeah he had to have had some awkward you you you didn't oh oh boy okay again uh you know torch  my like torch my soul that's stupid you know it feels like to cross hang on the  beep with the with the funny cartoons uh sticks yeah it'll be on yeah it'll be on one of those 
[02:03:30]  bloopers shows out and a cannonball run yeah he's like he laughs with somebody like a  with the credits rolling next to him hal needham comes out and cuts the whole thing off all right  cut oh you idiot camera wasn't on dom de louise laughing in the background and finally brian  williams here's another you know mission statement from uh nbc listen to this horse crap we should  probably say we're working with law enforcement on some of this because we don't want to create any  more heroes or martyrs too late no copycats we're working heroes or martyrs we're work what does that 
[02:04:00]  mean we're working you're not the fbi you don't you're not working with anybody hand over the uh  material and shut your mouth here's what he said earlier the the whole way he worded it the president  of uh nbc uh news division there he worded it like law enforcement uh told us that airing this  wouldn't interfere with their investigation which doesn't mean law enforcement didn't tell them 
[02:04:30]  don't air it yeah he said it wouldn't interfere with their investigation now it's when he was asked  did law enforcement was their concern about airing this material the question that was asked was asked  was their concern based on copycats but he answered it law enforcement said this will not interfere with  the investigation no it doesn't matter nobody has to tell you yeah it doesn't i mean it's like when  when uh the hillary clinton and anybody else running for president talks about the money they've raised 
[02:05:00]  we've we follow the letter of the law yeah but you shouldn't take money from people from companies  right right there are certain people you shouldn't take money from let's get the law we're running out of  show we want to get this on and then we got steve kapp is trying to defend uh just a few moments ago  the videos and the pictures you mean crap is working with law enforcement on some of this because we  don't want to create any more heroes or martyrs from those so the material has to be combed through  we will after examining it air more of these materials tomorrow morning on today again as we 
[02:05:30]  go through and analyze what is in this voluminous multimedia package that arrived here at nbc  a multimedia voluminous multimedia package now available on three discs on 1499 they just used  this killer's material to promo their own property yes no it's like i was you know robert smiegel that  does the cartoons yeah we were watching back when flight this nobody cares about this anymore flight 
[02:06:00]  800 that was a jet that that fell off yeah it fell out of the sky into the water yeah and uh it was  awful all these people died so then on cnn they had this big um promo done tonight flight 800 uh you  know what happened and who were the victims and and they were it was so sensationalized that it was  like it's trying to get you to go oh i love flight 800 oh that's my favorite thing that's my favorite  show did you see flight 800 last night awesome i'm so glad they're doing flight 800 again brought that up 
[02:06:30]  they just make it look like it is a tv because now now they put the music and the big you know  no and every time that you see somebody talking like whenever somebody dies and one of their  the the people that one of the relatives is on tv talking about how sad it was that person was picked  up by a town car driven to a studio right put a thing in their ear a microphone they said can we get  a level from you they signed a thing they got powder on their face little makeup little hair and  then okay you ready oh my god i'm so sad it's just all phony it's all showbiz fake here we go 
[02:07:00]  steve kappas uh or krapas he should be fired we should demand this guy gets fired for just lying  to the public why he is airing this crap uh and now everyone else is he had that one guy decided  he could have just said you know what no way no effing way but here's him trying to defend himself  you turn this material over but then you you've got a different decision to make and this this is  also a big part of the news story well um sure i mean and we had a very long discussion 
[02:07:30]  with a number of people throughout the organization and with well when you were having these long  discussions did you have something in your ears like by the way is he being interviewed by a guy  that works for him right he is he is he's got that up too louis on fox you got your your puppet that  is asking the questions that probably he told you this is a script they're working off a script he  should just be interviewing himself right should i have done this yes um yes that's an excellent 
[02:08:00]  question i'm gonna be asking myself the hard questions today right right listen to the semantics  that are used in this though organization and with law enforcement about what to do with the material  um they the virginia state police asked uh made a reasonable request which was to not do anything  with the material until they had a chance to review it uh so we uh sat on the material for most of the 
[02:08:30]  day i mean wow most of the day most of the day not even a day it went up on on most of the day most of  the day all right now i understand no they sat on it because they were waiting for the prime time  news to start yes you don't want to show well there's just soccer moms at home in front of their  tvs he makes it sound like it's the timing of like when they release national security documents and the  government yeah yeah we put this into cold storage for most of the day most of the day so that only 
[02:09:00]  later generations of today how does this guy have a job how does he run the news department this we  didn't air this uh for what amounted to the tens of minutes you wouldn't believe how many seconds  went by and most of the day was spent getting as as many copies as possible yeah they were doing  other things during that time to get ready to air it we have an atomic clock that was almost worn out  yeah we're just by the time we hear oh god i mean as i said it came into the building at 11 a.m 
[02:09:30]  um there was one still picture released after the virginia state police had a news conference at  which they announced that this material existed what time and the video didn't air before 6 30 last  night seven hours material all day long uh all day long seven hours explain these horrible oh then  now he's trying to go he's trying to go now how do you how could he have shot those people yeah like  now he's trying to he's off the let's deflect away from the fact that we're horrors what we did is 
[02:10:00]  totally understandable but what he did is yeah i mean come on my singing wasn't that bad sign just  they never give disclaimers just the fact that they are yeah volume they're panicking i think uh i think uh  i i think it's backlash backlash it's a backlash media frenzy time because the rest of the media  pile on pile on and the rest of the media will have no problem turning this into a frenzy because  they're all pissed that they didn't get the tape they didn't get it yeah horrible events and this is 
[02:10:30]  i think as close as we will ever come to being inside the mind of a killer and and i thought uh that it  needed to be released and um i i note that pretty much every single uh news organization all around  the world has made the same decision but you got you had it in your hand examine the contents of the  manifesto and so forth manifesto you had it in your hands you could have actually stopped all of them  from airing it they did it they sent it to you it's why does it have to say nbc i know he must really 
[02:11:00]  he just must be a fan of nbc oh while he was shooting people he was going dun dun dun  he's trying to make peacock things i hope you sleep well at night mr kappas uh rob bartley we  don't have time for you can you call us tomorrow buddy no problem oh rob bartley from the imus uh  morning show imus in the morning we haven't really heard from rob since the whole thing went down and  he wants to go after keith oberman and msnbc and you're plugging a gig get the plug out rob  i'm at the uh upack center kingston april 28th all right definitely call tomorrow yeah we so want

[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  All right. 
[02:17:30]  This show is flying by today.  We got Louis C.K. joined us for the walkover to XM.  And as we're sitting waiting to start the second half of the show, we're watching TV and we got the grieving mothers, you know, talking to the media and we're trying to figure out what would motivate a parent to go on CNN, Fox.  We're going to cry openly on beautifully three-point lighted television with the makeup, they had to sit in the makeup chair and the makeup bars had to say something like, wow, I'm really sorry about what happened. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah, thank you. 
[02:18:30]  I mean, you're distracted.  I mean, you're distracted.  I mean, you're distracted.  Like, your kid died.  It's an awful thing.  Yeah.  Like Louis said, the phone's ringing and you actually have to, like, put your hand over the receiver and go, it's MSNB.  Like, oh, my God, I've seen that guy, Brian Williams is hot.  How do you just not fucking unplug the phone?  How do you not tell any news media that calls you, get the fuck off of my fucking phone?  You know, you got to think.  There's some parents that got the exact same phone call and said, go fuck yourselves. 
[02:19:00]  There has to be.  I remember watching Boston years ago, some kid in Medford or one of those awful shit neighborhoods in Boston.  Fucking Medford, somewhere next to the fucking airport, next to Logan, all by the Sumna Tunnel, all those fucking cunts up there.  So, some girl was killed and it was one of those row houses where there's just chain-link fences and just death and, you know, bummer.  Bummer.  You just feel death.  Yeah, a bunch of people.  No one cares.  So, some girl dies and her brother's on the news and he looks into the camera because he knows he's on. 
[02:19:30]  And his sister just died that day.  Yeah.  And he goes, I hope justice is served.  I hope it's served soon and harsh.  And harsh.  And he said it really, and even the reporter looked like, dude, you know, calm down.  You're weird.  It's served.  You're soon and harsh.  Yeah, people really love the idea that they're going to get to be the victim on TV.  And she cried.  Not even, like, putting her hand over her eyes. 
[02:20:00]  Just tears.  Gushing.  Yeah.  That's a weird, a whole, I don't know what goes through your head.  Just once, don't you want to be a parent and see a parent on TV crying about something like that and just go, I'm just thanking God it wasn't my youngest because I do love her more.  Oh, God.  Just to see something so bizarre on television.  Something so out of the ordinary, yeah.  Like a bad flight or something.  Weird.  I'm sorry, but it's like, you know.  What could possibly come out of it that's positive?  Nothing.  Unless you're, like, using the media to make some kind of stand and try to get changes made and how they handle this stuff and how they prepare for this so it maybe doesn't happen again. 
[02:20:30]  Then maybe.  But I'm not hearing that.  I'm just hearing, like, oh, my daughter was an honor student.  And, like, I can't imagine I would ever do that.  No.  I can't imagine.  In a million years.  Fucked up people's kids get killed sometimes.  Is it their way of dealing with the situation?  I mean, I'm sorry exactly for the 32 people that were killed.  And, by the way, the 19 injured who were like, hi, I can't walk anymore. 
[02:21:00]  Excuse me.  I'm kind of interesting, too.  Injured doesn't mean I fucking, like, cut my finger here.  Yeah, that's what everybody...  I have bullet holes in me or my legs are smashed from jumping out a window.  Oh, they just sawed off my leg.  Yeah.  It's a drag.  Civil War injury?  Someone got their leg cut off?  Well, I don't know.  Oh.  I'm taking the guy that...  I'm so gullible.  Well, the guy that had the injury to the artery in the leg, that's never good.  I hope he saw a Union soldier just getting his legs sawed off as they put leeches on  it.  With a strap in his mouth.  Yeah.  He's biting down on all it. 
[02:21:30]  To leech his son.  And I'm fascinated by all this media coverage.  No, it's amazing.  And why people do what they do.  Hey, Jimmy, so what's the pre-sale?  I mean, we can save this a little bit today.  Yeah, the pre-sale...  We messed up big time.  Well, yes, but we didn't.  I'm going to say, meaning Greg, James, and Ant, if I may.  Hey, the buck stops here.  Yeah, it certainly does, but take the buck and stick it up your mother's cunt.  I have to kind of roll it up and make it stiff enough.  No, you don't.  Not your mother.  Now, when you're finished, drop it in and watch it flutter down to the bottom. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, that's good.  I'm also hearing pre-sale ends at 10.  We didn't tell people that either.  Uh-oh.  Well, why would we know that?  We just don't have our...  Get Pete on the phone.  Pete sent the right email.  That email.  Where's Kenny?  Oh, Kenny's out.  The email Kenny showed me, I will show you, was...  It had that you have to click on the...  Go to opianthony.com.  Click on the banner.  I think they've moved it up.  Apparently, it's on the bottom of the page, but now it's been moved up for the... 
[02:22:30]  On the page.  Didn't give out the real info.  Don't even know that the pre-sale is only an hour.  We're just a terrific organization.  We're firing on all cylinders.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on and why we are fucking...  I don't know why this is so hard for everyone to kind of get on board with.  It's a pre-sale.  Give us the info and we'll mention it.  Opianthony.com I did mention, but the way it was worded on the paper I had was...  All information is at opianthony.com.  I'm giving out information.  That's like saying we can hear the same ship, just go there. 
[02:23:00]  But why would people do that when tickets are always on Ticketmaster?  Yeah.  And I'm telling you, 9 a.m., so you go to Ticketmaster.  No.  You've got to go to myspace.com slash opianthony or go to opianthony.com and on the front page  it will say pre-sale and you click on it.  And now, oh, this is the first I've heard of it, is from my friend here, says it's only  an hour.  Only until 10 a.m.  Yeah.  So that's good.  More information that we didn't have until five seconds ago.  9.20.  Yeah.  9.20. 
[02:23:30]  And who knows what else is...  Maybe there's another piece of information that's being withheld.  And you can only get these tickets if you can prove that you have not consorted with  any non-whites in the last 30 days.  So what you're saying is tickets, pre-sale tickets, will be available for most of the  day.  For most of the day.  Most of the day.  40 minutes.  Hey.  Great observation.  Ed and Dallas, go ahead.  Well, every time Louis C.K. is on the show, within the first five minutes of XM, drops  the cunt word. 
[02:24:00]  Of course.  And it took him about a minute.  And why not?  Of course.  I love it.  And why not, my friend?  A cunt is the greatest word that was ever called to a cunt.  Hold on.  I'll put you on speakerphone, Pete.  All right.  Now, Pete, I love when everyone tries to defend themselves now.  Can you hear me?  This could be a great...  This is going to turn out to be a great...  Women.  Pete says, Pete, you're on the air.  Pete, do you want to straighten this right out?  Yeah.  The pre-sale started this morning at 9 o'clock.  It's through a company called Music Today.  You can get the link on OpieNanthony.com. 
[02:24:30]  The pre-sale goes until at least 5 o'clock tonight.  They're going to be extended a little bit.  And that's pretty much all the details you need.  Wait.  Hold on.  Now, Opie just said, because he was told, that it ends at 10 a.m.  Where did we hear that?  Just some dumb caller that I assumed had the right info.  I'm guilty, too.  Hold on.  From the callers?  He just got his info from the fucking multimedia manifesto.  From a caller.  The guy said 10 with something, and he thought that was when the pre-sale ended.  All right.  So the pre-sale is going until 5? 
[02:25:00]  They're going until 5 o'clock.  There's not a lot of tickets available on Breach City.  They can only get their service.  Okay.  And what do you think about...  What do you think about the tickets actually going on sale tomorrow?  What do I think about them?  I mean, like, they're going on sale at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning in what markets, all that  stuff.  They're going on sale.  We already know.  Shut up.  Goodbye.  Oh, he was all revved up.  See, that's how you get Pete talking.  You just ask him about fucking dates and ticket sales, and he'll just fucking go. 
[02:25:30]  In a lather.  All right.  So that's good news.  We're going until 5 o'clock.  All right.  So you could go to Opie and Anthony.com and click on that link, and you'll get some tickets.  Hey, Mark in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good.  All right.  Welcome aboard.  All right.  So I just wanted to tell you, a friend of mine was...  Sir, Opie was trying to talk.  It don't matter.  Go ahead, Opie.  It's your gig.  Fuck this guy.  No offense, sir.  It doesn't matter.  All right.  A friend of mine was killed as a firefighter in the Bronx last summer, and the reporters,  of course, descended upon the parents' house trying to get the exclusive story. 
[02:26:00]  Same story, and the parents didn't want anything to do with anybody coming in the house, talking  to them, completely devastated, and it got to the point where one of the reporters actually  posed as a flower girl to get herself in the house to talk to them, and it actually got  to the point where some of the brothers took matters into their own hands, and after we  detonated a fire extinguisher in the back of a news van, they got the message they weren't 
[02:26:30]  welcome.  What did they do in the back of a news van?  Detonated a fire extinguisher.  Detonated a fire extinguisher.  Now, let me ask you a question.  What was the reporter's name who posed...  What was the network she posed as a flower girl?  Who is she?  Well, I don't want to get anybody in trouble.  What do you mean you don't want to get somebody in trouble?  I don't know if we can confirm this.  Yeah, we can get in trouble.  I wouldn't be like...  They're just...  They're relentless.  They're absolutely relentless.  You made your point.  Thank you, sir.  If we knew it was true, if we knew it was a name, then we could be liable.  We're actually smart broadcasters.  People don't know that.  I'd love to give out the name. 
[02:27:00]  I don't care if it's true or not.  I am a dumb cunt.  She was probably a cunt.  That's right.  Hey, could you get it?  And if it wasn't her, whoever we named was probably a cunt, too.  I'm a goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  What is that?  That's a great clip.  That's a show.  Goldblum.  That is, yeah, Jeff Goldblum from his first movie.  Independence Day.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Independence Day.  He didn't like the way fucking Judd Hirsch was playing such a fucking Maki.  That's from Death Wish. 
[02:27:30]  He played one of the thugs with the Jughead hat on.  When we were doing the walkover, which we probably should have broadcasted today,  Louis C.K. was telling us a horrific flying story.  We told our little story, which now sounds like a cute little airy plane ride,  when we had to fly in during the storms into a Newark airport.  After our Vegas show.  After the Vegas show.  And it was quite the bimpy ride on the way in.  We hit that wall of clouds. 
[02:28:00]  And then it was nothing but pure white-out clouds until we broke through.  The ceiling was probably at 800 feet.  Well, Louis flew an airline I would not fly.  Really?  No.  United?  I don't fuck with United.  Why?  Exactly for the reason.  Because they're fucking cunts.  That sounds like a take the bull by the horns pilot, though.  That's the kind of guy I like.  Because I was sitting there in the airport saying, what happened to us was, we got on the plane.  They loaded up first class. 
[02:28:30]  So we were sitting there, drinking a drink.  Sipping.  Sipping.  And they start boarding, you know, last class, as Kenny likes to call it.  And all of a sudden, they get an announcement.  Could you get up and leave the plane?  There's now a delay.  See, I thought they were just talking to coach people.  Exactly.  Because they smell the joint up.  Right.  Could you get out?  Because we don't want you in here while we're waiting.  But they told everybody to get off the plane.  Please get off the plane because it's funny to us.  We want to watch you get off and back on. 
[02:29:00]  So they made us all get off the plane because of the delay, because of the weather.  Right.  Then they tell us it's going to be, you know, like an hour or two.  Meanwhile, ten minutes later or so, they go, all right, back on.  We got a window.  Yeah, get in.  Get in.  Everyone back on.  So we all run back on the plane.  Yeah.  And during that time, though, I say, you know, I want a guy.  I want a pilot, a man, that has been in wars, that just goes, you know something?  Fuck this.  I've flown in this shit before.  We're going for it.  Right.  Well, that's what I have.  And just there you have that. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, no, sometimes you get a pilot who says stuff.  Like, I had a pilot once who said, you know, they're not letting us take off.  L.A.'s locking down because of the weather there.  But I anticipate that it'll clear up by the time we get there.  So I'm actually telling them we're going to Las Vegas.  I've had a pilot say this.  And then we'll reroute.  Well, you're lying to the fucking power?  Don't lie to them.  Control, we're going to Las Vegas, Colorado.  Nevada.  Nevada. 
[02:30:00]  Las Vegas, Nevada.  Yeah.  Well, we might take a turn somewhere before that.  We're going to Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  Las...  But so this guy, we're sitting at the gate waiting.  And then he said, actually, the delay isn't because of the weather.  It's because the fuel gauge is broken on the plane.  Of course, there's a hunk of shit out there.  You know, so...  But we had somebody...  They still have the ashtrays in the bathrooms. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, that's why...  That equipment is old.  That's why I can't fly United.  I had to once and I saw, like, ashtrays they still didn't take out of the bathroom,  which means, wow, this plane's pretty old.  And then they had, like, a razor dispenser or something.  Yeah, you could actually get a razor blade on the plane.  You could shave.  Yes.  Right here on the plane, you can shave if you want.  The miracle of modern flight.  Yes.  Fucking nice.  Light up a lucky strike and join us on a transcontinental flight with no stops. 
[02:31:00]  It's the miracle.  As soon as I saw the old ashtrays, and it might not have been United, but it was some  airline, it was a white knuckler all the way to the destination.  Yes, and the seats have that kind of 60s Mike Brady kind of pattern on them.  Oh, great.  If the seats are old, how old is the engine, really?  Exactly.  You're going to tell me they replaced them.  Great.  That's still not going to give me comfort.  But contact.  Yeah, contact.  And the engines are made from space-age polymers.  Yes.  So the guy says the fuel gauge is broken, but we filled up the tanks, we topped them 
[02:31:30]  off, and we had someone climb up and look in the tank.  That's what you do when you have a motorcycle.  And you don't want to know, yeah, exactly.  You don't want to know that there's a dude, you want to think that something really weird  and scientific is-  Right.  It's like a dude looked in the way.  Some guy looked.  I hope that dude is not a fucking idiot.  Like, now I have to hope.  Well, you hope he has depth perception.  Yeah.  And hoping he's not just hungover, like, oh, yeah, I checked.  Exactly. 
[02:32:00]  Did you check the wing?  I fucking checked.  Of course I did.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Fuck all those people on the plane.  But since they tell me there's a little, like, minor thing, like, that's broken, I'm  like, what else is broken on the plane?  Yeah, exactly.  And usually when your car breaks down, it's not one thing.  All of a sudden, everything is breaking at the same time, right?  But here's the thing.  This was like a little time-release capsule of terror that he left with us, because he said,  this is no problem, because we know we have more than enough fuel to get there.  Sure.  Because it's full, that would be more than we need, and we can even circle for a little  while with that amount of fuel.  So then we get to LaGuardia, and we're circling and circling and circling, and then he says, 
[02:32:30]  we've only got 20 minutes worth of fuel left.  How the fuck does he know that when the fuel gauge is broken?  Yeah.  Yes.  He did a math problem in his head, probably.  He did it through time, but look, he knows how many hours you can fly on a certain amount  of fuel, but if maybe there's more stress on the engine when it's going through bad weather.  Nice headwind.  If he's five minutes off, we're going to drop from the sky like a set of fucking car keys.  Avianca did that.  Yeah.  Right into Long Island, yeah.  So he goes, we've got 20 minutes of fuel left, and LaGuardia is trying to shut down, 
[02:33:00]  but it's minute to minute.  So we're going to go ahead and make an approach to LaGuardia Airport.  And as we get closer, if it gets bad, we'll divert and use the last of our fuel to land  in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  We have enough fuel to do exactly that maneuver.  Oh, my God.  So then he starts coming in.  We'll divert to a place where there's lots of big open fields where innocent people won't  be killed.  We will divert to the fucking, to the, you know, to the Verrazano Narrows. 
[02:33:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, one thing you won't have to worry about is fire.  There is no fuel left in the tanks.  Yes.  We are doing 500 miles an hour, but you won't burn.  Thank you.  But so he starts coming, and we start dropping down into the clouds, and it's the ugliest  fucking, I mean, the clouds are yellow and brown out the window.  Yeah, it was nasty.  And there's water on scene, right?  Yeah, and so me and the guy next to me, the fucking two idiots, we put on the headphones  and listened to the channel that you can listen to the tower. 
[02:34:00]  You can listen to your plane talking to the tower.  And so he says, United 266, we're making an approach, we're making an approach.  And then we hear LaGuardia Tower say, do not land, 266.  The winds are far too heavy.  It's not stapling.  We're shutting down.  Divert right now.  How do you not pull the headphones off and just make believe you didn't hear it?  And the guy says, we can't divert now.  We have only four minutes tops of fuel left.  Holy.  So we have to come in. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, God.  And the tower's saying, it's not a good idea, but go ahead, because what else are you going  to do?  Give it a shot.  Give it a shot, Jim.  All right, hot shot.  And right at that moment, the stewardess comes up to you, would you like to have some coffee?  No clue.  Yeah, no, the flight attendants are all strapped in and invisible.  They're nowhere to be seen.  And I'm holding on like it's going to help.  I'm holding on to my fucking window, like the edges of the window.  I'm just like, just in my, I'm stamping my foot just uncontrollably.  Wow, you are fucking scared shitless. 
[02:35:00]  Well, because we're dropping, we keep dropping.  And once the landing gear goes down and there's all that drag on the plane, the thing is pitching  and rolling and making impossible banks to the left and right.  I mean, it's like a fucking, like a joke.  And we're going, and the woman, there's a woman behind us holding two children, screaming  and sobbing, literally going, oh my God, oh my God.  She's doing exactly that.  That's the soundtrack for everyone on the plane.  Oh my God, that's horrible.  And she's got tears bursting like she's on a fucking train to fucking Auschwitz. 
[02:35:30]  No way, I gotta die.  She's saying her kids, what is her?  She's saying we're going to die to her kids.  She's telling her kids they're going to die.  And fucking Tastic.  Yeah, and the pilot sounding stressed on the, even more than, I've heard black box  recorders and the pilot is like, sounds like he's smoking a cigarette until the second before  death.  He's like, we only have four minutes of fuel, we can't divert.  Like he sounded like that.  You probably thought you were watching a movie. 
[02:36:00]  Oh no, it was like, wow, this is great.  Why wouldn't this be death?  If I wasn't on this plane, this would be great to listen to.  This is well directed.  Yeah, I love this movie.  I love the woman in the backseat.  She was awesome.  And we drop out of the clouds and we see where we are.  We are so close to those fucking Queens housing projects that are in the X shape.  Yep.  Like, it's like the nightmares you have.  If we were to, if the wing were to tip over, we'd hit the building.  You're hitting it.  And we're going, I've gone over those housing projects thousands of times. 
[02:36:30]  I fly all the time.  We're going so fucking fast.  We're flying, like, we're just shooting over Queens.  Oh man.  And even the most Texan tough guy passengers that were from Denver that were on that plane  are like, whoa, hey.  And we just, it was so bad that when I, just to jump ahead for a second, when I got in the cab,  uh, uh, the guy said, the cabbie said, I saw that plane come in.  That looked bad.  Like, cabbies on the ground.  We're watching that one plane come in. 
[02:37:00]  Because we're the only assholes that fucking landed.  No one else was coming in.  And so we're coming in and the plane is, looks, I mean, I, I'm convinced we're hitting the  BQE.  We're going to just, whatever it is.  And we hit the ground so fucking hard and my heart is racing and I had tears in my  eyes, just like, just involuntary, just tears coming down my face.  Like, what are these?  And the pilot says, ladies and gentlemen, you are free to turn on your cell phones and  call your loved ones.  And every single person with a phone was, the whole plane was chatter of like, you wouldn't 
[02:37:30]  believe what just happened to me, honey.  I thought I was going to die.  And I looked at my phone and I thought about calling my wife and I'm like, fuck her.  I didn't call her.  Fuck her.  I thought I was just about to die.  Fuck her.  You're calling like a friend.  I don't want to.  Hey, dude, you never guess what the fuck was happening.  Yeah, no, exactly.  Because I know what it would have been like, honey, I thought I was going to die.  Oh, that's awful.  Did you, what time are you getting in?  Why are you so late?  Tomorrow morning are you going to let me sleep in? 
[02:38:00]  Well, honey, I just thought.  Why wasn't that reported?  Well, fuck you.  What the fuck?  Why didn't that story get out?  That's obvious.  That guy will be fired.  He should be fucking fired.  It was really bad.  The pilot.  Bad judgment.  I think what happened was that he had enough time to do what he thought, but then the tower  sent him through an approach that took longer than he expected.  Took longer.  It's just what happened with Avianca.  They were flying around, and that was a language barrier, too.  They didn't declare an emergency.  They declared something that was just under an emergency.  Yeah.  So they kept diverting him from airport to airport and making him circle, and the plane 
[02:38:30]  ran out of fucking gas.  Yep.  And the people that survived the crash were like, all of a sudden you hear this silence,  and all you hear is the wind wishing over the wings.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  No more.  And you know how the noise of the engines kind of cancels out noise in the cabin?  Yeah.  You hear everything.  Yeah.  You hear the people in the back fucking row, if you're in first class.  Yeah.  And just whoosh.  And they crashed into the woods.  Yep. 
[02:39:00]  No fire, no explosion.  No, and that's what.  And the breeze, and fucking, you know.  A lot of people live because of that.  And the windows.  Right on, kind of near where I live.  No, no, when?  When you run out of fuel in a plane.  On a plane.  Maybe longer.  It's not like when you run out of gas on a car.  When you run out of gas on a car, you can actually, like, use the starter motor to get  it a little further.  Yeah, yeah, right.  You can kind of keep sputtering.  But on a plane, it's just, it's fun.  And you can stop and get the fuck out.  Yes.  No matter where you are in a car.  How did the dudes, because he told us that he couldn't be sure how much fuel there was on  the plane before we left.  Right.  He said, we know the gauges are wrong, but we're going to go anyway because we've seen 
[02:39:30]  the gas.  So then you better, well, you know something.  But when you get that close, you go, let's fucking land now.  You might even be able to justify that if you're going from point A to point B without  any problems.  That's fine.  If you're going into weather, where you're going to have to circle.  And when you're talking about we have four minutes.  Four minutes.  Four minutes left.  How fast is that four minutes?  One minute off, you're dead, and he has no gauge.  That four minutes is not four minutes in a dentist's chair.  That four minutes is four minutes on a roller coaster. 
[02:40:00]  All of our pilots are Vietnam combat tested pilots, but they're also fucked up Vietnam vets  that kind of don't give a shit.  That's what I want.  They just think you're a bunch of faggots whining on the back of the plane.  All you people that call me a baby killer, we're going in.  It was 1990?  I'll be honest.  All right, well, why don't we take a break and continue?  That's fucking awful.  That is a harrowing experience. 
[02:40:30]  Worst flight ever for you, I guess, right?  Easily.  I mean, I'm on a fucking platinum and 15 different airlines.  About a million miles, probably.  I fly through bad weather.  I sleep through it.  I don't give a shit.  I actually have often turned to people around me on planes that look scared and said,  I've seen this.  This is nothing.  Don't worry.  I don't care.  I like flying.  The lady behind me, by the way, I kept yelling back, we're okay.  Like, I kept yelling at her, and I was yelling at myself.  We're going to be okay.  We're going to be okay.  We're going to be okay.  Fucking torture. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, man.  There was something about flying on Sunday, because you could feel it in the air when we  were in Vegas.  We're getting ready to go.  We're like, oh, I think this one's going to be a bad one today.  It was tense.  Because we also have flown in a lot of bad weather, but nothing like this past Sunday.  It got so fucking quiet in the cabin when we were bouncing around in the clouds, and  Patrice turns around and goes, I just want to, and to all of us, he goes kind of loud,  he goes, I just want to tell you, I love you all, and then turns back around, and the  second we landed, he went, look, it got a little crazy back there. 
[02:41:30]  I got a little scared.  Yeah.  You know, don't mean nothing by it.  And then they canceled 500 flights after we landed, so they were pretty much close  to the airport after we.  They were jostling around and shaking, and the plane kind of doing those voom, and I was  looking out the window at the wing, and you can anticipate what's going to happen in the  fuselage by watching the wing tip, so you can anticipate the bumps.  Yes.  So you watch the wing tip, and man, it's just, it's moving like, the wings are flapping. 
[02:42:00]  I'm on a fucking, like an 1800s guy's idea of a flying machine.  Where the fucking, yeah, where the wings flap, and he jumps off a rock, and he crashes.  Like that guy's plane.  It's going to drop a baby into a chimney somewhere.  But you taught us that those wings could, like, touch.  I've seen in wind tunnels tests and turbulence tests where the wing tips just about touch  on top.  Jesus.  They can bend, but you don't ever want to see them moving like that.  Anthony and I had eye contact because we were both doing the same thing, looking out the 
[02:42:30]  window like, hello, where's the ground?  Yeah.  We've been approaching for, like, 40 minutes, and Ed's looking at me, and then we're both  looking out the window like, and then finally when you saw the ground, we were so, it was  amazing how close we were.  A piece of ground come out, and we were low, and I looked it up going, did you see the ground?  He goes, yeah, I just saw the ground.  And then I'm going, I see more ground.  He goes, yeah, it's good.  I go, we better start seeing runway though because it's getting really low.  No, but when you hit the ground in flights like that, the instant the wheels touch the ground,  you're like, I don't care what else happens to me. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, we can skid off of the fucking runway.  I don't care if some country, if Iran invades tomorrow and starts sodomizing me daily.  I made it through that.  I'm on the ground.  When the wheels hit, it's like for two, maybe three seconds, you stop breathing and wait  for that quick slowdown.  And then you're like, oh, yeah.  And then you feel it instantly, like, oh, okay, we're good.  Yeah, I get on the phone and call you.  And then you just get...  Start worrying about whatever bullshit.  You just get broadsided by a 747 coming in at 500 miles an hour. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, we met.  What the...  What happened?  We're going to break and I guess we don't need bad flight stories today.  Louis C.K.  We just heard the topper.  Louis C.K.  What happened, Jimmy?  One more.  What happened, Jim?  I was flying to L.A., actually, and it was right after breakfast, and my cinnamon roll  didn't have as much frosting as the cinnamon roll on the person next to me. 
[02:44:00]  Who is it?  What were we doing?  Fuckers.  Hmm?  That's awful.  You must have been panicking.  Yeah.  I had to ring the bell twice to get my tomato juice.  Tom in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, um, I worked on jets for nine and a half years, and the pilot told Louis a flat  out lie.  You cannot look at the gas in the plane.  Really?  Everything is sealed.  They would have had to bring out major tools to open the tanks up. 
[02:44:30]  The whole jet is a big-ass fuel tank in the wings, the belly, everything.  No, you know what?  That makes sense, because it's not like when you fill up a jet, you just fucking...  It's not like a motorcycle.  You just stick the nozzle between your legs.  I just think when you...  You kind of tip it around and make it hear the sloshing.  When you told me that, all I thought of was a scene in The Great Escape when Steve McQueen  takes the gas cap off and shakes the bike a little bit, and then takes off again.  All they did was rely on the fuel truck, asking him how much he had in the truck and how much 
[02:45:00]  he had left.  Oh, God, so somebody's doing like a seventh-grade math problem.  And let me tell you, they never top the tanks off.  No, they don't.  Because they only...  It would be...  It's not fuel-efficient.  Right.  They put in enough gas as they need to get from point A to point B, and then some extra  for circling.  But if you fill your tank up, you're just hauling more weight.  Yep.  So they had just enough.  Thanks, pal.  That makes...  Four minutes is frightening.  This is really funny. 
[02:45:30]  Steve on Long Island, go ahead.  I just wanted to relate a quick story.  When I was back in...  Going back to college upstate, we took a Cessna up there, and we got some ice on our wings.  Uh-oh.  And I looked down, bro, and we weren't moving.  And all of a sudden, I look at the pilot, and I go, are we going to go down?  And he didn't answer, and my buddy in the back goes, we're all going to die.  It was the sickest shit of all my life. 
[02:46:00]  What happened?  And we were going backwards, because of all the ice on the wings, man.  Oh, it was scary.  Going backwards?  It might have looked that way, sir.  It's crazy.  Like a piece of paper.  All right.  He's fluttering down.  And then a giant dragon came along.  Yeah.  That's right.  Blocked us out of the sky.  Don't call this show again.  You should have hit a mountain, you cunt.  Kenny, can I help you?  Yes.  Yes, can I say something?  I guess.  If someone will make your mic forward. 
[02:46:30]  Go, Ken, go.  Yes, it was brought to my attention that the...  Hold on, the mic's not on.  Why would it work?  What would be the reason for that?  Except for...  Dude, the mic's on.  Are you plugged in?  Oh.  Hello?  No, okay.  No, now the mic's not on, because you gave him a thin mic.  I'm hearing some kind of bassy...  Yes?  No.  This is the best part of the show.  Yes.  Yes.  Incompetent.  All right.  Doesn't sound like as loud as me.  All right.  It's not on, Kenny.  I'm not even fucking with you.  It's not on.  Is this a bit?  I can't hear it.  You hear him fine, Derek? 
[02:47:00]  Are you guys fucking with me?  I am, no.  I swear to God, I do not hear Kenny.  I don't hear him either.  Give me the signal when we're doing a bit.  You hear him, Louie?  Do you hear him?  I swear to God, I don't hear him.  Test.  Test.  Wait a minute.  What the...  You don't...  Test.  I'm the only one that hears him?  I don't.  Test.  Look, to prove it.  Testing.  I hear him.  Testing one, two.  Hello.  I hear him through the outside.  Hello, it's Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, my God.  How many is that?  Right?  I can hear him totally.  I can't hear him.  Club Soda Kenny.  The fuck, Morris?  Club Soda Kenny.  Mars will fix it.  Of course you will.  Mars will... 
[02:47:30]  Club Soda Kenny.  Now, wait.  So, he was on the whole time, but I was the only one that could hear him.  Now, I hear it.  Well, the listeners got more Kenny, which they love.  More Kenny equals more entertainment.  Right.  I'll keep it short and sweet.  This is...  Remember the old days?  It was E-X-T-1.  Ah.  Was it A or B?  That is...  That's going back a bit.  That's an old bit.  Oh, it was...  Yeah.  It's always B.  I forgot all about that until just now.  Anyway, that's one for the old schoolers.  Go ahead, Kenny.  I just wanted to say real quickly, it was brought to my attention that the Mohique, 
[02:48:00]  King's son, pre-sale tickets are all gone.  So, let's blow out the rest of the pre-sale tickets and do it.  How many do they have for sale?  20?  Your regular fucking cheerleader, Kenny.  I love it.  How many?  So, let's blow out the rest.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, people.  Let's do what we got to do.  It's actually...  What is it?  500 or a venue is going on sale?  Or a thousand.  Yeah, there's enough.  It's special tickets for our special fans, special seats for the special occasion.  So, it's special. 
[02:48:30]  Everything's special, yeah.  So, let's...  Guys, we got a few more minutes in that pre-sale.  Tickets going like...  Oh, now I'm here at 5 o'clock, Jimmy.  What am I talking about?  God, am I dumb?  Yeah, but just...  We just will never get to the rest of that.  It's just a special offer for our special fans.  So, click on the website or the MySpace and get the pre-sale tickets.  That's right.  And you'll get better seats than the normal people.  That's right.  We got...  Many's special sales manifesto.  Do we got...  It was a manifesto.  We got cheap tickets for the poor listeners?  Yeah, in the bigger venues, they get the standing room only. 
[02:49:00]  All right, cool.  Yeah.  All right, so I just wanted to say that to make everybody happy.  Oh, those people won't heckle.  No, no.  It's just standing for hours.  Yeah, but they're so far away, you can't even hear them heckling.  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  All right, have a nice day anyway.  Thank you.  All right, good.  Well, Mohegan Sun...  Club Soda Candy, everybody.  Club Soda Candy.  Apparently, the pre-show ticket is sold out according to Club Soda.  Very interesting.  What do you guys say?  I am so glad this is the last casino we're playing, though.  Yeah.  You're going to go broke, bro.  It's costing me money every gig. 
[02:49:30]  I can't do those, you know.  Every gig.  Hey.  So, we got audio of a father and brother going on Larry King Live to talk about her death.  Yeah, see, they went into the studios at CNN in Atlanta.  If they're on Larry King Live, they went...  Are they there live or are they talking...  Either way, they got driven somewhere, taken in, mic'd, you know...  Had to go through all the showbiz part of the news.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, that is frightening. 
[02:50:00]  Mic checks and making sure the lighting's right and the makeup and the hair.  Hold off the commercial.  Hold off the commercial.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, can you...  Can you hear somebody real friendly?  Can you hear me?  Yes, I can hear you.  Yeah.  Can you hold off on your despair because we've got to get a few commercials in?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We've got to promote Larry King's 50th anniversary.  Keep taking on.  Yeah, exactly.  We're going to be talking...  Next week?  The meeting that they had beforehand.  Yeah.  All right, remember it, guys.  Keep it light before we go to air.  So don't get her upset.  Keep it light, like, how you doing? 
[02:50:30]  And then once we hit the air, then ask her the questions that are going to get her crying.  No, and also they do...  If you work in any...  I worked at Conan.  I know exactly what they're doing.  They have a segment producer that calls and says, what are you willing to say?  And what are your feelings about it?  Be comfortable talking about...  So that they know the talking points, because they can't just ramble.  Yeah.  It's only a few minutes.  So what are you...  Tell me some things about him, and will you cry when you say that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When can we expect the tears?  Yes.  Because that's kind of like the big payoff.  Stay a gun-toting chink on the air, because if Larry could beat you... 
[02:51:00]  We would really...  You know, we could work off of that.  Yeah.  Gun-toting chink.  Yes, you know.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, Lou, that's insane.  Thank you.  Thank you, pasty crinkle.  Pasty crinkle.  He's writing from three hours in the past.  Hey, Ope, listening to tape show of this morning, I want to let you know that I caught the deep  reference about diving for morphine.  Thank you.  Oh, the deep.  Wow.  You were talking about morphine, and then I'm like...  You didn't even hear it.  You're like, well, Jimmy said, can you get that?  I heard that you say that, and I didn't know what it meant. 
[02:51:30]  I probably didn't see the movie.  I thought it was, like, the morphine grows under the ocean.  I was so dumb.  No, the deep, that's what they were diving for, was the morphine.  Little tiny bottles of morphine.  Thank you.  It was very obscure, and I'm like, oh, boy, I bombed horribly, but still.  No, I think it was a serious fact you were giving out.  No, no.  I don't know morphine facts.  What do I know?  You think morphine comes from the bottom of the ocean?  Dude, I didn't say I was a fucking medical student.  As a kid...  You don't have to be a medical student.  As a kid, that opening scene was hardcore porn.  Oh, yeah.  What was her name?  Just diving in the wet t-shirt, the white t-shirt? 
[02:52:00]  That was when she was hot.  Jacqueline Bissette.  Holy shit, the opening scene of that movie.  I remember that when I was a kid, though, because it came right after Jaws.  Jaws, yeah.  And we all went thinking that someone would get eaten by a shark, and there was nothing.  Well, that's how they presented it, too.  In the trailer, they kind of showed it like it was going to be more Jaws.  More Jaws.  Yeah, more Jaws.  But it's just Jacqueline Bissette and some fat, fucking, limey cunt talking.  Yeah.  About nothing.  Looking for morphine.  Yeah.  And that's how Orca was another one that was going to be the next piranha. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  That was stupid piranha.  Went with every flounder.  Orca was annoying.  The fucking stupid whale followed him to another country and then fucking bought a condo next  to him and fucking started taking his mail.  Fucking faggot whale.  I hate it.  I like when it ate Bo Derek's leg.  Yeah, that was a good one.  You and Dudley have something in common.  Only one working leg for the next 10 sequel.  The fucking club-footed cancer skull.  Have a head full of puddin', silly.  The best was in Jaws 8. 
[02:53:00]  She wants to finally escape the shark, so she moves to the Caribbean.  I mean, that was just brilliant writing right there.  It's an easy way to get away from the sharks.  Why not Arizona?  It's called fucking Cleveland.  Why not Arizona?  I mean, no.  I'm going to get away from all this and I'm going to settle down in the Caribbean.  This time, it's personal.  That was the slug line for it.  Did they ever explain why it had to be the Caribbean?  Or did they just make believe that that was just...  Yes.  They just...  Because otherwise the shark can't eat her.  Yeah.  It's a real dull movie of watching her driving to malls and shopping. 
[02:53:30]  You have to put a hit on her through goldfish.  It helps you win one of the fairs.  Like when she falls asleep, the goldfish swims in her pussy and bites her heart.  Swims through her pussy and bites her heart.  That sounds like a fucking Stevie Nicks lyric or something.  That's awesome.  Hey guys, we did four hours on this today.  You want to maybe do something unorthodox and talk about something else?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a...  German shit videos.  Let's talk about them for a couple.  We can talk about the asexual population out there.  What?  People that don't have sex. 
[02:54:00]  Asexual.  Oh.  Asexual.  And...  What about us?  And we got some other stuff.  What about married people?  You're not having a lot of sex, dude?  What's that?  Oh.  What's that?  No, he means what's that?  No, you know what?  Even better.  I don't even remember.  Do you get blown a lot?  Do I get blown?  Fuck you.  No.  No.  I got blown last night.  It was fantastic.  And I'm like...  That's great.  I want to cum on your pussy.  So she climbed on and sat on it.  It made this...  It was so wet.  It made this sound...  That's great.  Wow.  What do you have, a robot?  That's great. 
[02:54:30]  Jesus.  We got something on kids and how they ruin your sex life and ruin your marriage.  And with Louie in here.  I know, because they grow up.  That could be the perfect thing.  There you go.  They grow up and start saying no.  Jesus.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  This is Unpredictable Radio.  Holy crap.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  Look at you.  Oh, man. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm a grown man and I'm being yelled at.  You're idiots.  All right.  Well, more symbolism happening on the TV to make us all feel better.  Everyone that died at VT will get a diploma when graduation comes around. 
[02:55:30]  See, I misread it.  I assumed...  Like your friends or the traumatized...  No, I thought everyone that is in the school right now...  No.  ...will graduate.  No, you have to have died.  You have to have died.  So the people that died, that were murdered, get diplomas.  Yes.  So they...  Yeah.  What?  This is...  We were just doing this.  This is somebody's mom who died that day gets a call. 
[02:56:00]  We have some good news.  Good news.  Wait a minute.  Is my son alive?  Well, no, no, no.  He's going to graduate.  Yes.  So you're telling me he's alive if he's going to graduate?  No, no.  I'm saying that he's...  No, he's dead, but he's getting a diploma.  Still dead, but a diploma.  How is that good news?  Because he can stick out into law school.  Are you kidding?  From Virginia Tech?  That's a great diploma.  But he's...  That's a great credential.  But you're telling me he's still dead.  Yeah, he's still...  Look, fucking whining bitch.  We let him graduate his...  By the way, his grades were shit. 
[02:56:30]  He wasn't even close, you fucking cunt.  But I...  He's going to have a fucking degree from Virginia Tech.  That's money in the bank.  Okay, thank you.  Thanks for the call.  You're welcome.  Yeah, about time to thank you.  That should put a smile on your face.  How does that help?  I don't know.  How does that fucking help anybody?  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Jeremy in Ohio.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  There it is again.  The cunt kills me.  Yeah, my daughter's saying it now.  Oh.  It's all right. 
[02:57:00]  She learned it before her husband's daughter.  Is she saying, Daddy, stop fucking my...  Oh, my God.  Blank.  No, she's not saying that.  That was as vulgar as that could have been on every level.  Cunt is in there.  Baby incest and Daddy, stop fucking my...  All right, you talk.  No reason for me to try to improv.  Go right ahead, sir.  It's all about you.  I didn't mean to riff and have fun.  Go ahead.  I left it.  No, it's just that I was driving her off this morning and she said, cunt.  And I was like, oh, God, here it starts. 
[02:57:30]  Because my wife already gives me a hard time because I go around saying cunt all the time.  What was the...  I like that there's no context because that makes me picture just some kid getting out  of the car in front of the school going, yeah, cunt.  I can't believe I got to fucking go to school again today.  She just yawns and it comes out.  Cunt.  I can't believe Dad's such an asshole.  All right.  We should get into some other things.  Mm-hmm.  The kid thing is an old thing.  Whatever, no, kid's getting in the way of love and sex and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  So.  So what do you want to...  What else about the gun-toting slope? 
[02:58:00]  No, I mean, there's no new developments there.  Well, we have some audience members out there.  What?  We have a big crowd.  Yeah, we got three guys.  Two couples.  And some guy that's trying to pay them for a threesome.  No one brave enough to take the couch today, the front row seat.  Yeah, they're way in the back today.  Yeah, why?  All low self-esteem.  I don't know.  The front of the couch area.  Also, we never took our penis power stories from the women yesterday.  From that audio we played.  My girlfriend was mad because I kept sending her IM saying that she wanted me to bottom 
[02:58:30]  out when I fucked her.  Yeah.  She's like, what?  That's painful.  I'm like, yeah, but it's a good pain.  She's like, what do you want?  What are you doing?  You're trying to show that you have a big cock.  No, I don't.  When is she going to Rome?  That's what she wants and I can't handle it.  When's Rome?  She's not going.  Oh, she's not.  Yeah, you put your fucking foot down.  Nice, Jimmy.  Good boy.  I wouldn't care if she went to Rome.  Good boy.  I trust her.  You're going to Rome?  That's the official story.  I know.  That's fine.  You say that out in public, but I understand what you did and good for you, Jimmy.  Are you going to Rome?  No, she was going to go because one of her best friends who's been there for five years 
[02:59:00]  invited her actually to leave tonight and go for four days and she finally has the money  for airfare.  Her friend's been there for five years?  So her friend knows all these fucking guys and shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Don't send her to Rome along with someone that's been there.  Hold on.  Her friend has a fiance and they live together and my girlfriend will be staying with them.  So her friend won't be fucking.  That's nice.  Hey, can we tell the boat story yet when we were on vacation in Turks and Caicos?  Oh, God, with the fucking horny captain. 
[02:59:30]  Like when you, back in the day, we all went to Turks and Caicos and you fly out of JFK  and you pretty much see the people in the airport that you're going to be hanging out with for  the next week at Club Med.  It's a Club Med plane.  Okay.  So there is this woman and we saw her saying goodbye to her boyfriend and she was really  sad that she's going to be away for a week.  They're crying, hugging each other at the fucking.  We saw while she was on vacation.  So, yeah, we kept seeing her around and I guess she was with friends and stuff like 
[03:00:00]  that.  We went out on this snorkeling trip and we had to cut a little short.  Oh, it was the party, the booze, cruise, beach party, whatever the fuck it was.  We were on a boat in the Caribbean and we had to head back.  There was a storm coming.  So the waves are getting a little choppy and the captain, this fucking guy, this guy  from fucking Turks and Caicos.  Yeah, he's decided, look, I'm down here to get pussy.  Yeah.  Like, he figured it out a while ago.  That's why they work there at Club Med. 
[03:00:30]  Club Med ain't paying a lot.  There's a bunch of guys that are just trying to get pussy.  And this chick got so drunk on the punch and now she's flirting with the guy that's driving  us back.  Beer and sangria.  And she's flirting.  And we're driving through this fucking rainstorm.  So he invites her underneath his little awning and the captain thing.  The next thing we know, she's on her fucking knees blowing the guy, blowing the guy as  he's driving the fucking boat in a torrential downpour.  We see this storm coming and the guy's slowing down. 
[03:01:00]  He don't give a shit.  Because he doesn't want to get back now.  So he's slowing the boat down.  And we're thinking, this guy's going to get us fucking killed because he's getting head.  Yeah.  This woman is right underneath where the fucking wheel is.  Her knees are in, like, rusty red paint.  Bilgewater.  You just fucking, the little, the skipper's wheel is going ding, ding, ding, ding off the  top of her head with the little handles on it.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Punch me the head.  Ding, whoops, sorry.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  You just knew what was going on.  And so when she was crying to her boyfriend, she's crying in anticipation of the pain of  the island black penis breaking her ass.  And again, we all took the same plane back.  Isn't that romantic?  How romantic.  We take the same plane back, too, because the whole thing's a charter.  So she's on the plane again, and we got to see the greeting back at the airport.  The boyfriend waiting, and she's like, baby, running into each other's arms.  Oh, look at that with you.  Big kiss, and we're just like, ugh.  He's fucking tasting fucking one. 
[03:02:00]  He tastes like a conch shell.  She wonders why her mouth is fucking propped over like a scream mask.  What happened?  Her tongue is all salty from that old salty dog.  Too bad you didn't get a picture of it.  You could have showed him, so this is what she was doing.  Hey, dude, by the way, you want to see a nice picture?  Her fucking flip-flops sticking out from underneath the fucking skippers.  This girl, she was a dirty girl, man.  Just getting hammered and flirting.  Yeah, there she runs into the arms of her boyfriend back at JFK. 
[03:02:30]  Listen, here's the difference.  Yeah, what?  Rome.  She'd be with her friends.  It's not a big...  Yeah, but Rome is full of fucking Italian men.  Exactly.  Fucking horny dagos.  You got to look at it from her point of view.  You think about, I mean, for her, it's like going to a strip club.  Rome is full of brown, kinky-haired, fucking hot guys.  Right, why would she make sense?  All these Italian guys that want fucking sex.  I don't think she would fuck around.  She's going to get fucked on a scooter.  She's going to have a Vespa in her vagina. 
[03:03:00]  She's one of the only girls in her vagina that I really trust.  I don't think she would fuck around.  It's misplaced.  Why isn't she going?  Did you say that?  I'm sure it's...  No, I actually told her I did trust her.  She's like, it's just a matter of, logistically, she's too soon to plan everything.  Sure.  Her friend's birthday and stuff like that.  That's good.  It's her friend's birthday, sure.  Get the...  Whatever story you have to tell everybody.  And I'm sure that she would have invited me.  I mean...  Of course.  Oh, really?  She maybe thought I was busy, even though I'm going to be on vacation next week.  Huh.  That's interesting.  I think it's the invite.  That's weird.  That's interesting.  Okay. 
[03:03:30]  It's interesting.  Yeah.  It's all good.  Why would you go?  She's a cool chick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would I want to go and have fun in Rome?  Rome.  It's not like there's anything to see there.  I get invited, like...  A single thing.  I get invited to stuff, like, by proxy.  Like, well, you can go if you want, like...  Oh, if you want.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just nothing.  But you know how you get invited to stuff?  They're like, baby, let's go to Rome together.  Like, I'm going to be...  Like, it's almost like you get the state, but they're like, I'm going to do this, I'm going  to do that.  You're like, okay.  And then they hear the thick silence, and then they're like...  I mean, well, you know, if you want to go, you can...  If you want to.  Yeah.  If you want to go and push the Italians' cheeks, I'm always treating my mouth like 
[03:04:00]  a pocket pussy.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack.  Jack in Boston.  Yeah, hey, it's Jimmy.  I love you guys.  Love the show.  By the way...  Ah, whatever.  I was just going to give you a little info, but you're still talking.  My friend was going to speak.  Go ahead, Ope.  You do it.  You take the helm.  I just want to let people know the local station that we're on up there, BCN, has given  away tickets every hour for their...  Excellent.  ...for our tour that's hitting Mansfield.  So, another way to maybe get some tickets for yourself.  Listen to BCN.  All right, Jack.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Go, Jack. 
[03:04:30]  Go.  All right.  When I was in college, my fiancé went to Rome.  Within three days of her being there, we were no longer engaged, and she was fucking  some Italian dude.  So, Jimmy, you're fucked.  The difference is that you're an ugly faggot, and your fiancé was a cunt.  Yes.  Well, that's also true.  Jim is a talented, interesting, handsome fellow, and his girlfriend's pretty cool.  Yeah, I am a sweet boy, and have you seen, like, the way I eat pussy and ass?  I mean, fucking good, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, but at least I can bottom out. 
[03:05:00]  Can you?  How big's your dick?  How big is my dick?  Yeah.  Well, you know...  Big enough to bottom out than an 11-year-old girl.  An 11-year-old corpse.  Fucking his dead niece daily.  I love funny people.  Bottom out gets easier every day, because it's shriveling and death shrinking.  What is better than hanging out with funny people?  Shrinking like an old pumpkin.  All right.  Oh, you bottom out in an 11-year-old corpse. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, thank God.  I don't have the most offensive thing I've said today.  It's fucking...  Now it goes into your hands.  Dude, it's fucking...  Having funny friends, it rules.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It fucking rules.  After is the best medicine.  That's what they say.  You're right, Lil.  Let's go to Raul from Florida.  Raul.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Raul.  Hey, guys.  I was just stripping online today, and I went to what's that called Joystick, and they had 
[03:06:00]  this thing about the guy who shot those guys in the school.  Yeah.  His name, what is it?  Chow Soon Quint.  Yeah, whatever.  And he had no video games at all.  So they have no right to blame him on video games.  I heard Counter-Strike was brought up last night on TV.  What was that about?  What was the angle with Counter-Strike?  It's a great game.  It is a great game.  A lot of fun.  I don't know.  I play it.  Thanks.  Yelled at by fucking kids. 
[03:06:30]  Fucking nailed you, dick fuck.  And they all curse with their little headsets.  Because now you can hear it and talk.  All right, you can hear each other.  Oh.  Crazy.  Fuck you, douchebag.  And you're like, I want to play the game.  It was so much better when it was just text.  Yeah, yeah.  Some eight-year-old is fucking killing you.  You know, now you hear their voices, and they're just kids.  Like, just, ugh.  And they just fucking nail you, too.  Yeah.  You run around.  You run around a corner.  Bam.  Right in the face.  Dad, dick. 
[03:07:00]  Fucking noob.  You stink.  Yeah, you stink.  Their little voices.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're in my fucking 40s, running around like an idiot, getting just fucking shot at  every turn.  Dad.  And that's how you hear it.  Dad.  Look at this fucking asshole.  Look at him.  Let's just stay here.  I'm going to stay by the spawn and just shoot him every time he reappears.  I had a great trick, though, for those little fuckers.  When I was playing Half-Life Team Fortress, and it's a great game. 
[03:07:30]  Another one.  You know, you're out there just playing online against a bunch of people.  Sure.  But they had this thing where you were able to tag walls, and they had little things you  could download to tag, like a skull.  You walk up to the wall and hit a T, and it would make a spray paint sound, like, pfft,  and you'd see a skull up on the wall.  It was kind of cool.  But I also figured out how to take pictures and put them up on the wall.  So I would take these nude, fucking hardcore pornography, put it in, spray paint it up on 
[03:08:00]  the wall, and then take cover behind a barrel.  Right.  And the kids would run up, and you'd see them looking up.  Their character would actually be standing there, and there were five of them.  And I'd throw an explosive pack and fucking detonate it and watch them go flying.  Oh, my God.  It's hysterical.  You hide under the stairs.  It's like kryptonite to these kids.  Oh, they would stop dead.  What the hell?  They'd run, stop dead, and look at it, and just fucking unload on them.  It's a good way to beat a child in a video game.  Show them a cock or a cunt.  What is this, Danny?  Best spray ever?  Let me get on the mic. 
[03:08:30]  CT's.  It's like an 11-year-old corpse.  Spray is on the...  Bottom out.  I used to play Counter-Strike a bunch, too.  And I'll never forget, one time I was running through one of the maps, and I was a counter-terrorist  in Counter-Strike.  And what they would do is they would spray the opposing team on the wall.  So I'm sitting there shooting what I think is the enemy.  Oh, fuck.  That's great.  What a good idea.  But I'm really just shooting the wall.  And the guy's behind me just watching, just watching.  And once I'm done with my clip, and I'm on my computer going,  What the fuck? 
[03:09:00]  Why won't he die?  He just headshot, bam.  Oh, wow.  I watched...  Oh, that's a great gag.  It was great.  I watched him do it all day long.  It was fantastic.  Very good.  Let's get another story from Rome.  It's Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  Hey, Matt.  Last time we did this bit, it was about Jamaica.  Jamaica, where you just...  Yeah, man.  They came out of the woodwork, but now it's about Rome.  Matt, go ahead.  Little Jimmy.  What up, Matt?  What's that?  I'm good, buddy.  He's in good shape now.  Shut up. 
[03:09:30]  That's right.  I'm 5'7 of rock.  Hey, brother.  I'm 5'8 of mush.  All right.  All right.  Get to your story, fucko.  When I was in college, my girlfriend went to Florence, brother.  And I'm telling you, those guys over there, they prey on American women.  Yep.  Yep.  They prey on them.  And she ended up hooking up with a carbonary, which is like their local level state police.  And I went to visit her.  And the first night I got there, we had sex. 
[03:10:00]  And I could tell immediately she had just got split wide open, brother.  Listen to me.  Wide open.  First of all, my girlfriend's already been there.  Second of all, if she wants to bang someone, she could do it here.  Right here in the old U.S. of A.  And third of all, again, she has me at home.  I'm just going to visit Furio.  Shut up.  No, I don't think she would.  And honestly, I don't trust.  First of all, your girlfriend's mouth never doesn't taste like cum.  My girl, I haven't trusted women since I had an incident, a humiliating incident in 
[03:10:30]  about the fifth grade, which is coming out in therapy that I'm remembering.  Fifth grade?  Yeah, just the thing with trust.  Oh.  I know.  Can you share it or is it still working through it?  Oh, it's not painful on that level.  It's just embarrassing.  Here's why I don't trust women.  It's not the sticker push story.  No, no, no.  Love the sticker push.  I was in love when I was a boy.  My little girlfriend's name was Jill, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade.  Cunt.  Oh, on wheels.  And I had like a boy crush on her.  We never even kissed.  I remember she said like years later that my lips were too chapped. 
[03:11:00]  And I probably liked her more than she liked me.  But I remember one day I went to her house and I didn't know this would happen.  And my friend Andrew Cantor was there.  And, you know, we were all like in the same grade.  And Jill told me...  I can't wait to see this animated.  Oh, I know.  Every time Jimmy tells a story about his youth now, I see it in flash animation.  I was just using his name, Andrew.  Don't use his last name.  He might not like it.  But Jill and Andrew were hanging out.  And it's weird for me that they get there.  I think I had to ask her, well, can I come over?  And she's like, if I remember correctly.  So I'm sitting there. 
[03:11:30]  I think we all went down to the basement.  And then her and Andrew went upstairs to get something.  And they were gone for a while.  And I was such a stupid little Jimmy Norton just sitting in the basement.  And I found out like years later he told me that they were making out upstairs.  Oh, no.  And a part of the story, though, that is a tiny detail for you but amazes me.  You say she didn't kiss you.  I found out later it's because my lips were too chapped.  Yeah, she told me.  That means there was a conversation where you said, hey, years ago when you wouldn't kiss me,  she said, who's this?  Jim Norton.  You wouldn't kiss me.  Jim Norton, why didn't you kiss me? 
[03:12:00]  Your lips were chapped, you fuck.  No, no, no, no.  We were talking.  Here's what happened.  We were talking.  I saw her years later.  We saw each other briefly.  And we were joking about different stuff.  And she said, yeah, I remember your lips were always chapped.  So I kind of figured that's why.  Oh, so you put two and two together.  I didn't mention the kiss.  I asked her for a kiss.  It was so awful the way I asked.  What did you do?  What did you say?  I found out that her and Andrew were kissing upstairs.  And he told me a couple years later in high school.  This is like sixth grade.  So four years later he told me.  And I was in a rage.  Four years later you were in a rage about that.  Oh, my God.  Because I was so stupid for having liked this girl and not known. 
[03:12:30]  Fuck her and her fucking faggot Andrew.  Well, please, now.  It's easy for me to say because I've experienced trannies.  But when I was in sixth grade and our fifth grade I asked her for a kiss.  But I didn't know how to ask for a kiss.  So this was just true.  I sat my father down, my fucking awful advice dad.  I think he fucked one woman in his life and I showed up.  I said, how am I doing that again?  How do I kiss a girl?  And he goes, walk over and ask her if you can smell her breath.  And when she breathes in your face, lean in and kiss her. 
[03:13:00]  Which is almost an assault.  Kind of a sexual assault, yeah.  Oh, my God.  So even I knew at that age that that was awful.  So Jill and I are standing by this little creek in Hidden Lake, New Jersey.  The one she's in now?  The one she wound up in an hour later with fucking a rock with hair matted to her.  Next to her.  Floated out.  And she fucking...  Big puffy hands like Mickey Mouse. 
[03:13:30]  That's true.  Someone found her in fucking turtles, ate half of her face.  And I didn't...  I didn't know how to ask for a kiss because I couldn't just say it.  So I was such a schlep.  I was kicking the rocks.  I'm like, I want to ask you something.  And she's like, what?  I'm like, you know the name of my favorite band?  Oh, God, hold on.  I can't look at Jimmy now.  I can't either.  All right, I'm stuck.  Oh, Jim, that's so...  Now, not looking at Jimmy.  That is so generous of you to cheer that. 
[03:14:00]  That's so beautiful when you tell anyone that.  Because no one should know it.  Oh, my God.  You should have not told us and you should have killed her so she couldn't tell nobody.  Oh, that's beautiful.  And she's like, yeah.  I'm like, well.  And then she just kind of blew it off and didn't answer.  Oh, yeah.  She just wanted that to go away.  It was as I stood there with my fucking...  My calitaire and my fucking chapped lips.  And she silently says to herself, Jim, good luck living that down for the rest of your shit life. 
[03:14:30]  You enjoy the crannies that will not erase the memory.  So that's where I think my trust issues with women started once I learned that.  All right, let's go to Illinois.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  How you guys doing?  What's up, man?  Hey, I'm listening to you guys talk about whether or not the video games can have an effect on the kids.  And the only thing I'm thinking about is, you remember the 80s when everyone was looking like Michael Jackson and dressing up like Madonna and the military?  Today, using computer animation to kind of desensitize the airplane pilots. 
[03:15:00]  Why can't that apply for psychos?  Well, what are you saying?  Video games might be in some way responsible?  Well, not you and I with the quote-unquote normal.  But that's anything.  But that's anything.  Like, we can't gear the lives of everyone on this planet around nut jobs or children or things like that.  No, also, it's like you were saying earlier.  How, why would we think we're far away from this? 
[03:15:30]  Like, why did this happen?  It's not because it's some mysterious video game.  Yeah.  It's because killing people, it's interesting to watch people's heads explode.  Yeah.  And life is cheap.  That's pretty much it.  And because, really, what the fuck?  You should really actually be killing and eating people.  Like, what's stopping you?  It's the only thing you missed out on is eating.  It's not part of your body, so let it die.  But we're overlooking the fact that maybe we are desensitizing the children.  No, we're not.  You know what?  You know what? 
[03:16:00]  We're not.  People are going to be nuts.  There's going to be nuts in the world.  There are going to be people that can handle video games by the billions, and then one  or two that can't.  So, like, even if video games were directly responsible for a nut job shooting everybody.  Nobody is responsible except for the faggot chink with the gun who shot those kids.  Oh, absolutely.  Awful writer.  We're never going to have a perfect society.  You know, one guy messes up because he can't handle video games, so now we all have to suffer. 
[03:16:30]  So take it away from everybody.  The children might be affected, so take away any adult entertainment.  It doesn't even matter.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  I think the thing that's confusing me is, like, they're going on right now about the  letters that he wrote and how psychotic it is and the professors don't, you know, blah,  blah, blah, these papers he was writing.  What's any different than going to the movie theater and watching Saw?  What?  Well, there you go.  Answering your own question.  Good morning.  What is the difference, sir?  I'll tell you what. 
[03:17:00]  Thank you, Senator.  $9.50 plus popcorn.  Yeah.  That's the difference.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, I have one quick story about Rome, by the way, because this guy mentioned the  Cabinieri, the state police there.  Yeah.  I was in Rome once.  I went to Russia and Rome by myself, just pathetically.  Spoke to no people for two weeks.  Made no connections with anybody.  But that sounds so exciting.  It was interesting.  I saw some cool shit.  After a few days, were you going like, what the fuck am I doing? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  I'm in hotels.  I could be in a hotel in fucking Newton, Massachusetts, or Phoenix or something.  So I'm in a car that I rented in Rome, and I'm looking at a beautiful countryside.  These are postcards out my way.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  And I'm driving down a highway near Rome through the countryside, and I'm like, I'm  going crazy.  I haven't talked to anybody, and there's a roadblock of Cabinieri, state police, and they  look like Nazis.  They have high hats and boots up to their knees, and they have a RET or whatever stop  signs.  They have a roadblock.  They're stopping traffic.  And I just have this weird idea in my head. 
[03:18:00]  Nothing's happened to me.  I'm just, I don't care what happens to me now.  And I gunned it, and I went around them a little into opposite traffic.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I swear to God, I did this.  I floored it, went around a guy, and then I looked at my rearview mirror, and they're  running like it's the Pink Panther or something, like shaking their fists.  And I'm like, fuck it, get in your cars, chase me, put me in jail.  I'd actually happily be in an Italian jail, meet some Italian people.  He's insane. 
[03:18:30]  Because I hadn't had like the guts to say hello to anybody.  That is great.  So what happened?  Nothing fucking happened.  They shook their little fists.  They got small in the mirror, and I went on, and nobody did anything.  That's fantastic.  It's like a little bit of excitement.  If you got caught, you'd have to interact with people.  I'd be at some sergeant's desk who'd be typing my name, and they'd call somebody at home.  All smoking cigarettes, that weird European way.  Yeah.  With their thumb and forefinger.  Well, like when you see like O.J. Simpson, there was nobody even charged. 
[03:19:00]  He didn't even get charged for taking the police on a high-speed chase.  Like there's no, those things, and when you watch cops, when they get a guy, well, he  did a little, you know, did, you know, he got a fine for the chase.  Nobody cared.  Jesus.  What would have happened?  I would have spent one night in jail, and paid a fine, and met, and had a really interesting  experience.  Yeah, interesting jail.  You don't know what Italian jails are like.  Big unclipped cock going into your ass.  They're not going to fucking hang me for dodging a fucking, they find out I'm not a criminal, 
[03:19:30]  I'm just some asshole.  American comedian dies in hail of bullets.  Because he didn't pay attention to a stop sign.  Hey, back to the gaming thing.  A couple of instant feedbacks.  Use lad bag.  Confession time.  I was a little fag who played Dungeons and Dragons when I was a kid.  And people used to say it leads to devil worship and violence.  The truth, update.  The truth, we were just douches.  And then Pat from Foxborough.  I play Madden 07 all the time, but I don't play for the Patriots. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, see?  It's the most, there's two hacky comedian bits out there right now.  I'm on the road a lot now, watching Middle Acts.  Great.  One of them is teachers molesting their students.  This didn't happen when I was a kid.  That whole gag.  I do that.  And the other, you do that.  And then the other one is video game, I play Frogger and I don't walk out into traffic.  And get hit by a car.  I do that one.  Let's take a break. 
[03:20:30]  Louis C.K. is going to be at Caroline's next weekend.  Next week.  And Atlanta Pug Line this weekend.  This weekend.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  I like the hottest guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night.  Yep.  The Opie and Anthony show.  How to show the road.  How to show the road. 
[03:21:00]  Oh my God.  That's got to be on the radio.  So, Louis C.K. in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Describing life on the road as a comedian.  Oh, Jesus.  Describing jerking off.  Which is anonymous with life on the road.  You wake up around, I don't know, 11 a.m.  Wake up maybe.  And then you jerk off and go back to sleep. 
[03:21:30]  And then you wake up, put on the SpectreVision on the hotel.  You know, watch 50 of them before you find something that will get you hard so you can go on the internet.  You're not even jerking off to the shit.  It's spent about $1,000 right there.  You need a fluffing video.  Yeah.  And then to go on the internet, get some old pictures, fucking call phone sex, a few different lines.  Fucking jerk off.  It's now like three o'clock in the afternoon.  I haven't seen daylight.  The drapes are all down because I sleep during the day. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  3 p.m.  I'm fucking hungry.  I get room service, go back to sleep, wake up at like 5.  Go to the shit mall, get a soft ice cream, watch a movie.  Go to the comedy club.  The manager says, how you doing?  And I go, I'm all right.  I just spoke my first words to a human being.  Do a show up all fucking night because I slept all day.  Fucking nobody to talk.  Call them the West Coast because some of those people are awake a little later.  Jerking off and eating too at night at fucking 2 in the morning.  Oh, jerking off is just part.  This is like the clock running. 
[03:22:30]  You're just constant jerking off.  Call them people on the West Coast who I don't even know very well because I want to talk to somebody.  Anyway, times multiply this by two weeks or so on the road.  I retreat even more and more from people because I feel disgusting for what I'm jerking off to during the day.  And then I go home to my wife and it's like coming back from Vietnam.  I don't relate to my family anymore.  You wouldn't understand.  I'm Bruce Dern fucking taking off my clothes and walking into the ocean. 
[03:23:00]  I just fucking can't relate to society anymore.  Sell the car, sell the house, sell the kids.  Send that letter.  That curse letter.  Just less and less able to fucking...  Colonel CK.  Nothing to say to me.  Damn.  My wife is like fucking an astronaut's wife with a shaky cigarette in her hand.  He's fine.  We all love him here.  So he's proud. 
[03:23:30]  When was the last time you saw your family?  You've been on the road for a while, right?  Yeah, well, this morning.  I'm in New York.  We're all in the city.  So I saw my family this morning.  My wife came into the city only because we had to go to couples therapy.  So she brought the kids.  Today?  We went yesterday.  You would just yank your cock out and say, why don't you toot on this for a few minutes?  That's how you got to do it, man, as a married guy.  Holy shit.  That's a great idea.  How's that working out?  If I did that, she would just do whatever she was doing.  She wouldn't even look.  We don't look at each other.  If I took out my dick and said, why don't you toot on this for a while, she'd keep whatever fucking emailing. 
[03:24:00]  She'd be looking at whatever real estate wherever she wants to live when she leaves me.  She'd be like, I'm sorry.  Did you say something?  It would be nothing.  The counseling is obviously her idea.  Oh, no.  I want to do it.  You went for it.  Yeah.  I'm the one who said I wanted to go.  This fucking guy is, we did it last time we went.  It's a double session.  It was $800.  Wow.  $800.  What does he do?  Eat both your assholes while he talks to you?  Jesus.  That's $800.  Wow.  Is it doing anything?  Oh, it's great.  Everything's great. 
[03:24:30]  It's great.  Everything's great.  Oh, worth every penny.  It's fantastic.  Great, great, great.  $400 a person?  Well, it's $400 an hour.  You don't break it up by the person.  Oh, you go two hours?  Yes, couples.  It's a driving movie.  He puts her in the trunk before he drives.  There's only one person here.  Listen up, honey.  Is there anything you could share from those get-togethers?  Well, no, not anything about us.  The guy, though, the first day, he's telling us about it.  A lot of times he tells you about other couples to give you comparisons.  And he's like, hey, I know a couple because I'm on the road a lot and I work a lot. 
[03:25:00]  So he's like, it's hard for people with careers.  I know a couple.  He's a lawyer and he's a sports writer.  Right away, I'm like, I can Google that.  Make some connections.  Really?  I can figure that one out.  And he's like, so while he's covering March Madness.  He's a lawyer.  He's a sports writer.  And he goes, well, he's covering March Madness.  And she's lecturing about pornography and law around the country.  So I'm like, I know who these people are.  I can figure it out in 10 seconds.  Why are you telling me this? 
[03:25:30]  The next couple is going to come in and he goes, I know a couple.  I know a couple.  He's on the stars in Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie.  The first initial and his name are L-O-U-I.  Fucking douche.  That's got to be something, though.  You ever sitting there and listen to a therapist or something and go like, he doesn't get this at all?  No, well, the thing is, what happens in therapy is you really say this shit.  It's only because my wife, I know she doesn't have XM in the car she's in that I can say this. 
[03:26:00]  The other day she said, I hate, she pointed at my head and said, I hate him.  Oh, at the head.  Yeah, at my head.  Oh, yeah.  So here's the thing.  You get in there and you fucking have it out.  You say everything.  And then you get addicted to that.  And you can say, outside of the therapist's office, you can say nothing.  Like, outside of the therapist's office, we're just, like, at home, we're just, like, just bullshit talking about, you know, what did Rosie O'Donnell say today?  Like, we can't.  But if we start talking about anything real, it gets lightning rotted to what we fucking have said to each other. 
[03:26:30]  And if he's not there, we're going to kill each other.  Wow.  So we can only talk for one hour a week.  She said, I hate him?  And we spend all the other hours of the week in this strange avoidance.  If we were in a boxing ring during the week, people would be whistling and throwing paper and, like, do something.  And then for that one hour, oh, yeah, motherfucker, it gets hot in there.  I don't know how far we can take this, but why do you guys hate each other? 
[03:27:00]  Or can you discuss that?  What did you think when she said, I hate you?  What did you feel when she said, I hate you?  I hate you, too.  Okay.  Is it just over time, slowly but surely, the relationship broke down, or is this, was there a hit?  Oh, we got two kids.  I think it's like this for almost any marriage except for that we have, the thing is we have a traditional marriage.  I make all the money and she raises the kids.  But we have a traditional marriage in 2007, which means that you can't just say that.  Not traditional.  No, I don't get to say, I bring home the bacon.  Right.  You watch the kids.  You fry it up in a pan. 
[03:27:30]  Fry it up in a pan.  Yeah, it doesn't work like that.  I bring home the bacon, I fry it up in the pan, I feed it to the kids, and if I mention  that I pay the bills, I'm a fucking asshole.  Like, I'm a piece of shit for, like, somehow I'm being prehistoric, but it's true that I  pay the, you know.  So it's hard.  Like, marriage is harder now, I think, than it ever, ever has been.  And it's not, like, this guy, he wrote a book, the guy we're going to, and it's all  about how it's hard for marriage now because the women work. 
[03:28:00]  My wife doesn't fucking work, so.  So your theory of your book goes out the fucking window.  It's hard, but mostly it's because when you have kids, it's hard to fuck anymore, and you  also care about your kids far more than you care about your spouse.  I don't give a, I mean, my kids are my life now, I really don't give a shit about her.  I really don't, because how could I next to my kids?  I'm laughing because I'm fucking stunned.  It's just like a stunning thing to have.  The honesty.  Well, it's true, if our kids, if our kids, look, I've got a lot of history with my wife, 
[03:28:30]  and there's a lot, it's a complicated relationship, and I feel, I couldn't, you know, I feel a  lot of push and pull in many directions, and I'm fighting really hard to save it.  We're in therapy, and my whole life right now is focused on saving our relationship and  getting it back to somewhere good.  Oh, but do you want to say this?  It's the biggest deal in my life, but if my kids weren't here, I wouldn't even call her  to say goodbye.  I'd just walk in the book.  I just fucking, I wouldn't leave a note.  I would just stop being near her fucking cancerous body. 
[03:29:00]  You're saving it for the kids, then.  Totally.  100%.  I'm so glad I never had kids.  It's, oh my God, because the whole thing you're talking about, like, I used to get  ragged on for not doing things around the house.  I had these set chores to do.  There weren't much, but it was like, why, I'm going out, it's a new career for me doing  radio.  I'm really, like, learning the trade at the time.  This was, you know, years ago. 
[03:29:30]  And she's not working, and I'm bringing home the money, and believe me, a lot more  money than I was when we were both working, and I was knocking tin.  Yeah.  But then...  Well, the money you brought in, just to help you out a little bit, gave her the luxury  of not having to work.  Yeah, not having to work.  Right.  Which is kind of key, I think, to that whole thing.  But then there'd be these little chores I would have.  Like, I'd have to take out the garbage, and it was my job to vacuum.  And, like, if I didn't do it, I would be ragged on.  Like, I remember my mother fucking yelling at me for not vacuuming. 
[03:30:00]  No, and the thing is, to me, if you don't have kids, I don't get any of it.  And that was it.  If you're married, and you don't have children, and you have a bad week, get the fuck out.  Why the fuck would you save a marriage that's stressful?  Right.  When you have kids, that's everything.  You can't, you gotta stay together for the kids, because you gotta be...  It's not even that they need to have two parents to be together, it's just that you  want to be there for your children, because you fucking care about them.  But it's, you gotta look at it on the other side.  Like, the thing about having kids, too, is that spend one day, if you have kids, spend 
[03:30:30]  one full day with them, where you're...  Like, every time I give my wife a break, I fucking totally realize what she's going  through.  It's fucking murder.  You want to kill everybody in the world.  When you're alone with kids, and you don't have...  I mean, I have a job.  Even when I'm taking care of the kids, I fucking got my computer on my knee, and I'm working.  Like, I'm fucking writing a movie.  Yeah, you're still working.  Yeah, I'll call, just to make myself feel okay about the fucking trap that children  feel like on a given day, I'll call my manager and just say, what's going on? 
[03:31:00]  And he'll be like, well, we just booked another own A date in Camden.  Oh, good.  You know, go read a story to my daughter.  You know what I mean?  Because I'm not sitting in a room reading fucking The Happy Hen, and nothing else is  going on.  I've got a show I just booked in Camden.  I've put it on my website.  There's people talking about me around the country, buying tickets to my shows, ordering  my DVDs on Amazon.  That helps me sit in a room and read to my boring little kids. 
[03:31:30]  Kids are...  But my wife has fucking nothing, except to focus on what a piece of shit I am for dropping,  come into her and making people that have ruined her life.  That's all she's got.  So I actually completely see her side to it.  We are...  And what we found out in therapy is that we're trapped, and that it's neither of our fault.  So how...  But that doesn't make us go, oh, okay.  The only solution is killing the children. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, that's it.  Throwing them into a garbage can and letting them die next to a rat in a milk carton.  And you two just, like, spur of the moment, laughing, heading off to the Caribbean.  Oh, my God.  We'd have a ball.  Just having fun like the old days.  I actually think if...  Like, when I picture that, if we got rid of the kids, I would walk out the door.  Actually, what I'd do is fuck her face, and we'd probably get along crazy.  Why don't you guys go on vacation again?  Leave the kids with one of your parents for a few days?  And seriously, go away for a few days.  I want to punch you in the face for saying that.  Is that bad?  Oh, shit.  Is that bad?  I don't know.  It's just so complicated. 
[03:32:30]  One of them, she's still breastfeeding the kid who's two.  Can't get the kid away from her.  No, it's a mess.  Never do that.  Never do that.  Wow, man.  It's like walking up to a guy in a concentration camp and going,  why don't you just take a little trip somewhere and get out of here?  If you don't like it here, why are you hanging around?  No, but you can't give them to, like, your parents or something like that.  Because there's Nazis that will shoot me in the face if I leave.  Two's too young to leave a kid.  Wow, man.  Yeah, two.  No, we can't leave a kid.  Let's go to Minnesota, I think.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, love you, love your show.  Hey, Louie, I completely agree. 
[03:33:00]  To me, I think I'm just a dick for my wife.  You know?  I'm just a dick in a house.  Well, that one lost steam faster than you expected.  Yeah, I know.  You want to admit that he doesn't care about his wife either.  No, to me, I'm just a dick to the wife.  And so, hey, Jimmy, got a question for you.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I did that.  What is that?  That's fine. 
[03:33:30]  His apology.  Hey, David.  Here's an out for embarrassing phone calls.  Let's try to get this back in the rails.  Yeah, go ahead, Dave.  Oh, no, Louie, you're absolutely spot on.  Same predicament here.  You just go numb, man.  But I'm at the point where I couldn't give a fuck if my wife went out and got filled up with somebody else's cock custard.  I'm done.  Don't give a shit, man.  I'm just holding on, waiting for the kids to graduate.  Get the fuck out, man.  I had my...  I know.  If my wife cheated on me, it would change nothing.  Yeah.  You wouldn't leave her?  It would be leveraged for just the little things during the day. 
[03:34:00]  That's all it would be.  You wouldn't leave her?  No, because I can't...  I got plenty of reasons to do it now.  I got kids.  We want to stay together.  We want to have the kids.  And, you know, the thing is, the complex thing about it is that we share the kids, and that makes us happy together.  Like, we, as parents, we're fucking the best friends in the world.  We watch our kids do fun shit, and it's hugely rewarding for the two of us.  That's your common denominator there.  Yeah, exactly.  So, like, we'll be hissing at each other.  I hate y'all.  Never suck your dick again.  Fuck you.  You whole fucking heart. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, look.  Oh, look what she did.  Oh, my God.  Oh, isn't that cute?  So, we do, but that joy that we share with the kids, totally real, and it's actually making life worth living.  So, that's the thing that's complicated about it.  When I picture leaving, I'm not only sad to think of not being with my kids every day, which I am, I'm also sad about her.  She's part of that.  She's part of our...  You won't be able to share that with her.  No, and that's bigger, and actually, you know, look, I'm almost 40.  My dick is finally starting to get 8% less hard than it used to be. 
[03:35:00]  And so, like, the fucking joy of having a family is starting to outweigh the sex a little bit.  And that's kind of sad, because it's like, you know, I'm not going to care that nobody fucks me in a couple of years.  Dude, I think...  That makes me want to kill myself.  You know what I'm doing?  When she's laying there sleeping, start eating her ass.  Like a fucking loon.  Go in there and start eating her ass.  She'll be like, this loo is...  She sleeps with the fucking children.  So, I have to move my baby to the side.  The only thing is, if the kid looks at you, he goes...  Oh, he inadvertently sticks his face in the baby's ass. 
[03:35:30]  Wow, she's really, uh...  She's been working out.  She's toned up.  Let's go to Walter in Pennsylvania.  Walter.  Oh, hi, guys.  Love you, love you.  Hello, Walter.  Thanks.  Guys, look, Lucy Kaye.  I've been married 17 years.  I've got three kids.  My oldest one is 14.  My youngest is 10.  I'm in therapy for the third time.  We're together because of the kids.  She's a teacher.  I've got a...  I'm developing a girlfriend. 
[03:36:00]  It's...  You're developing a girlfriend.  I'm sorry, Louise.  I work...  I don't know what to say.  Yeah.  She's ignored me.  I haven't had sex in three years.  That's fine, man.  I get ignored.  I'm a local truck driver.  I don't know...  We're in therapy, and...  That's good, though.  You're talking about it.  And it's also good that you're honest about how long it's been.  Because whenever married couples, whenever married guys compare, like, how long has it  been for you?  Somebody goes, two months.  And now we all have to say two months because you lied. 
[03:36:30]  Why?  It's been longer?  Of course it has.  Two months.  What is your wife a whore?  Unbelievable.  Two months.  Two months ago, I was thinking about what it was like two years ago.  When's the last time you banged?  I don't fucking remember.  Honestly?  I think it was my birthday of last year, which is September.  I actually think that's the last time that my dick touched a vaginal fucking secretion.  Do you talk dirty?  When you fuck, do you talk dirty?  Talk dirty.  What the fuck?  Like, that's going to solve everything?  It helps.  Color, cunt? 
[03:37:00]  No, no, no, no.  And still fuck you more.  But I mean, like, you might want to open up a new door.  Sometimes you open up a new door.  Yeah, sure.  We talk dirty at the supermarket.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  Sometimes you open a new door, and you both get addicted to it again.  That's the way it is.  Yeah, but...  Was the sex awful?  No, it was good.  It was good.  Every time we've had sex, we've never had sex where it wasn't fun.  We have good sex.  But why not more often?  Too much other shit going on.  So why don't you say, look, I want to get blown.  It's like fucking in a war zone.  It's like trying to get blown into, you know, Iraq and pollution. 
[03:37:30]  You know?  Being shot at you.  Start losing your heart on when you watch people's heads explode.  You have no fear, man.  I like your honesty.  It's unbelievable.  She doesn't have exome.  You're so right about the no kids thing, though, because in my situation, I had the job.  That was my main, like, focus.  I had a brand new, exciting job that I always wanted to do, and that kind of made me stay  in the marriage for as long as I did, because that, I guess, you could equate to the child 
[03:38:00]  in the marriage was my job.  So after a while, I started realizing, oh, my God, I am miserable with this woman.  Miserable.  And have no reason to be with her.  And then when I found a girlfriend, the girl I'm currently with, I was given an ultimatum  by my wife who said, it's either me or her.  And I cannot tell you how fast I ran out the fucking door that day, went to the phone,  called up my girlfriend and said, I'm coming over. 
[03:38:30]  It's us.  It's done.  Oh, God, that must have been awesome.  It was fucking awesome.  It was the best.  But her ultimatum didn't get out of her mouth, and it got me thinking, like, she actually  spurred it in my head.  It was like, yeah, it is her or you.  Well, that's the thing.  Why the fuck am I here?  Goodbye.  When you're in a marriage without kids, it's about each other.  It's like it's about this struggle of two people trying to figure each other out.  When you have kids, that just goes away.  You start paranoid.  As a matter of fact, the difference between one kid and two kids is huge. 
[03:39:00]  Really?  Because one kid, you're both doing exactly the same thing all the time, that one kid.  Which, by the way, deranges the kid's brain.  Because the kid is a fucking, like, her face is like Beirut.  It's a battleground of two fucked up, war-torn people.  But then once you have two kids, you split off, and then you start fucking resenting.  And again, I totally, when I can put myself in her skin and go, I'm fucking killing that  guy when he comes home.  I mean, just shooting him right in the fucking face.  Because she doesn't even have any distractions. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, you get out.  God, I hate to be here.  Why don't you just do this, Lou?  I fucking hate it.  I don't have kids, but why don't you just do this?  So if you guys want to have sex, why don't you say, go in the other room.  Mommy and Dad need some alone time.  Go in there.  That's a great idea.  Go in there.  Once you get her help.  What's that?  You're making a pretty good living.  Get her a little help.  Fuck her, man.  I need my money to buy porn at the fucking hotel and stay at the Ritz on the road.  You did tell that story.  You stay at the greatest hotel.  I stay at the best hotel in every town, because fuck her. 
[03:40:00]  And then that's some kind of excuse why the money's not.  Yeah.  No, no, of course.  Look, she's an attachment parent.  She sleeps with the kids.  It's a very, we have babysitters, but we never would have a nanny.  I hate the idea of a nanny living in the house, but I've offered her to have any help  that she wants.  You should be on one of those kid shows where they like-  A lot of the nanny.  Whatever, the nanny.  You know what?  The nanny show is fucking horse shit, fucking cunt feed, which doesn't even mean anything.  I just wanted to say cunt. 
[03:40:30]  No, the thing is, if like we have a dog, we've had a dog trainer over, any new person  with treats will get your dog to do anything.  They leave, it's over.  Fucking nice lady with an English accent starts talking to the kids and there's a hammer  around.  Mary Poppins, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  It's Mary Poppins for a-  It's like sitting in front of a Mary Poppins movie.  When she leaves, it all hell breaks loose again.  Hey, Mike in North Carolina, you got something for Louis C.K.?  Hey, Louis, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, did you see this thing you had, you're still breastfeeding a two-year-old? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, my wife is, yeah.  Yeah, have you ever been to a grocery store?  It's called Gerber's, man.  That kid's probably walking around by now.  What time are you going to cut that stuff off?  She eats other food.  She doesn't just drink breast, she's two.  She'd have to drink like six gallons a day.  Oh, no.  She eats fucking hamburgers and french fries.  And just kind of washes it down with a wisdom tit meal.  Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?  It's comfort.  She does it for comfort.  It's actually, it's good to breastfeed kids for a long time. 
[03:41:30]  There's nothing better than breastfeeding to grow a kid up confident that it's good for  their brain.  And there's all kinds of shit, but it's taken too long.  All right, Maria.  Two years is too long.  Maria in New York.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say how depressing it is.  I'm going to be a year married in June, and I hope it doesn't happen that it happens  to Louis.  When did he get married?  In June last year.  First time it's June.  You said June, but then you amended it.  It sounded like it's June. 
[03:42:00]  Wait, it was one month again?  June.  She is a Latina.  She's a Latina.  Maria.  Maria.  Luisa, Maria.  Yeah, de donde estás?  Donde estoy?  No, de donde estás.  I'm going to correct you.  Donde estoy?  Yeah.  Where am I from?  I'm from Yoroway.  Say something else in that language.  Yoroway.  Say something else.  Tu madre es un muy grande chihuahua.  I don't know.  I've never been there. 
[03:42:30]  Faggot.  That's Spanish for a gym.  All right, you're depressed.  I am.  I really listen to you guys, because we are planning to have kids, and I just hope that...  That's the reason you listen to us?  No.  We help them come quick.  Are you happy with your marriage?  We are.  I am.  You guys get along great?  Yes.  And you're going to have kids?  Yes.  Great.  Good luck.  Enjoy.  Godspeed.  All right, let's go to Mike in Vegas.  Mike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got something for you.  Put it like this. 
[03:43:00]  I've been married for a long time, and my secret is you got to have someone else on the  side.  Someone European.  All right, good.  Someone with a hairy box.  All right, Steve in California.  Steve.  Hey, Louie.  Guys, love you.  Love the show.  I got to say, you guys have two of the greatest therapists on the air.  You got Patrice for the single guys, and Louie for the married guys, and then you got Jim  for a sex counselor.  Louie, I know what you're feeling.  I've got five kids. 
[03:43:30]  Been married about 18 years, and actually, I do have sex regularly.  My wife and I went through some struggles, and it was painful.  Our pussy must look like the hood of a sweat jacket.  But the string's pulled, so it's all pruning around the edges.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, guys, thanks.  Thank you.  Her twat must look like the fucking, an upside-down baseball cap.  It looks like...  You know, to me, the interesting thing is, because we know a lot of couples that have 
[03:44:00]  been through this time that are now doing well.  Really?  We know a lot of...  I've met people that have said what this guy said.  He's five kids deep.  He's still fucking, so he must have worked it out.  Did she make you laugh?  I'm amazed to think that this could work out and turn out to be okay.  So there's a point down the line where supposedly this works out.  Yeah, and I've...  You're a bit optimistic.  Yeah, I mean, I know it's happened to other people.  That means not at all that it's going to happen to me.  You got to do a show on 202, just talking about marriage. 
[03:44:30]  You're dedicated, but it's out of, like, selfishness.  Like, you're dedicated to this marriage, but it's out of selfishness because you enjoy  the kids, and...  Well, I mean, it's my responsibility.  I have to be there.  I have to be there for the kids.  I think the kids need me in their lives.  Yeah.  I don't think the kids would do well just with her.  So you're not...  Well, that's kind of cool.  Then it's not as selfish as it came off originally.  Did it come off as selfish?  No, I'm kidding.  Wait, Louie, do you...  No, maybe it is.  I don't know.  I might be very selfish.  No, no, no.  I mean, I am.  I am a selfish person. 
[03:45:00]  No, it just came off like the reason you're together is because you do enjoy the time  with the kids and the wife when you're with the kids.  All right.  Well, no, that makes...  But there are some people that stay together just based on the sanctity of marriage.  Well, that's horse shit.  The I'm not giving up on this.  That can suck my mother's bush all night.  I don't give a shit about that.  Sanctity of fuck you.  We'll get a couple more of that.  Chris in Philly, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Love you.  Love the show.  So, yeah, I went through basically the same thing Louie's going through.  You know, I was like, yeah, I just want to stay together just because I have a daughter. 
[03:45:30]  Then she became a real cunt.  I was like, all right, we'll go to counseling.  Maybe it'll work out.  Went to one counseling session.  And she's like, you're not into it.  You're just playing around.  You know, I was honestly trying to go.  I was like, all right, yeah, I want to stay together because of my daughter.  Now, she's like, we're done.  And that was it.  I was like, now she's being a cunt and trying to rape me for everything that I have.  Were you playing around?  No, not at all.  I called her a couple times. 
[03:46:00]  I was going through my computer.  And I said, let's see what she's been chatting about.  Went back in the chat logs.  Here she's talking to guys in Maryland.  Maryland?  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you know what they say about guys in Maryland.  Hands come off and the crab cakes come out.  Thanks, boys.  Punch it out.  Hey, Lou, did your wife make you laugh?  No.  Disgusting.  Did she make you laugh at all your wife?  Sometimes, yeah.  She's funny.  It can be funny sometimes.  It's important.  All right, Jeff the trucker.  Jeff, what's up?  I don't fart in the studio, by the way. 
[03:46:30]  I helped me out about a year.  Never have.  Man, I'm already miserable.  I was a local truck driver for a while.  She just completely changed when we got married.  You know, ragging on my ass about everything.  Married one year.  He's miserable already.  Well, you know, the thing is, any two people, you take two people and you put them in the  same house.  What the fuck are the odds that's going to work out?  There's just no way.  It's this simple.  The person you're married to will always disappoint you because they're not you with a cunt.  That's what I want her to be, is me with a cunt and no beard. 
[03:47:00]  That's it.  I want to fuck myself.  I want to make myself wet and fuck myself.  That's all.  Anything short of that is a drag.  Your wife is a cunt.  Your wife is a whore.  You hate your wife.  I'm already going back on the road to the over-the-road truck driver, so, you know, fuck it.  I just, like, hell, I can see more out here than I can at home anyway, and it's better  looking anyway, so what the hell.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Shh.  It's Mrs. Jimmy.  Hello? 
[03:47:30]  Here's another guy.  He's only been married a year.  Greg in D.C., what's up?  Oh, hey, boys.  First time caller, long time listener.  Love everybody there.  Quack, quack.  Yeah.  Hey, everything everybody's saying is just so hitting home right now.  I just had a kid three months ago.  I've been married for a year.  Fucking knocked her up again by accident.  She just had an abortion.  We both agreed on it.  Atta boy.  The thing is, though, I fucking, I've always talked to my ex-girlfriend, no matter what. 
[03:48:00]  Grandfather, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, your late-term abortion.  Yeah.  They fucking yanked the kid's arm after there was a watch on it.  Oh, fuck.  You guys are cruel, but, I don't know, man.  Keep talking, man.  This shit is fucking good therapy for me, because I just want to fuck it all, but I love  my little girl.  What can I do, you know?  I've got to pick it out.  No, and the thing to remember is that any fucking, you have kids with a person, you're  both, you're going to get it in a shitty thing.  There's just no way out of it.  Every marriage with kids is going to go to an awful place where you both want to leave. 
[03:48:30]  I don't think it's possible to not go there.  Wow.  I think anybody who tells you that they don't want to get there is lying to you.  What is it about procreation?  You've got to communicate.  Good one, Jim.  Communication's the key.  What the fuck is it about this procreation thing?  Because it says fucking the stakes get high when other, these little people are around.  Why do people want to do it?  Oh, why do people want to procreate?  I don't get it.  I got no answer for that.  Why do people, like, they get married.  When me and my wife got pregnant, this is how it happened.  All of our friends were having babies, and they all had to, like, pay money to doctors 
[03:49:00]  and go through, every single couple we knew went through, like, we have been trying for  a year and it hasn't worked.  And now we have to do this, unplug her tubes, whatever it is.  And so, my wife said, let's try to have a baby, and I didn't feel like having a debate,  so I'm like, ah, if you want to give it a try, because I really believe in my mind,  well, we'll cry for a while, and then I can, for right now, I can say yes, and I can say  no later.  And I fucked her once with no condom on a decent day, and she got motherfucking suck, sucking 
[03:49:30]  pregnant.  You must have been like, Jesus Christ.  That's great, honey!  Oh, shit!  Oh, my God, I was like, you gotta be shitting me, like, that fast?  How long had you been married at that point?  We had been married for 99 to, like, a couple years.  Just a couple years.  Yeah.  And then we had our daughter, who, and I immediately fell in love with her on site.  Really?  Totally changed my life.  That happened?  Yeah, that happened for me.  The instant I saw her, I was like, I don't even, I know what this is, I'm not gonna run 
[03:50:00]  from this.  That's what everyone says.  Some people run from it from the day it happens.  They're like, eh, no, I ain't fucking a fucking diaper, no.  And you see fathers that fight it their whole lives, and they play golf on weekends.  I'm not that guy.  I love kids.  I love the smell of baby shit.  I honestly do.  I fucking love watching them.  You know, I am a very, I found out shit about myself by having kids.  I'm a patient person.  I didn't think I was.  Yeah.  I thought I was a selfish, impatient, anxious faggot.  But I can sit and watch a kid try to tie their shoes and not let me help them when 
[03:50:30]  we have to get somewhere, and I can take a breath and deal with it and go, okay, no,  go ahead.  You can try.  Look, I can make a call and we can go later.  It's not the end of the world.  Go ahead.  Wow.  I found out that I have skills I didn't have, so it's been the greatest thing.  Wow.  For the second kid, it was boring because I wanted to stop an argument.  That really is.  A person exists in the world because I just wanted her to shut the fuck up for a minute.  There's a person with a birth certificate who will have a future and a job, maybe be the 
[03:51:00]  president, because I was like, all right, the fuck?  It's a fucking mistake and I'm on record.  Take off your pants.  I'll fuck you.  That's what you did.  That's what you did.  How many times did that take?  Fucking instantaneous.  You're amazingly fertile.  Fucking came out of her ass while I was fucking her in the puss.  She got super spurt.  There was a kid who was bumping my dick against her head before I was done.  Fertile.  Yeah.  Hey, Alex in Utah has got something.  Alex.  Hey, guys.  Long time listener. 
[03:51:30]  And I want to say that I've been married 10 years, got two kids, and me and my wife had  a rough patch a few years ago.  We went to a counselor and this bitch of a counselor was just all over me.  And then at the end of the counseling session, me and my wife were against the counselor  and we were calling her a bitch and everything else on her face.  And then you got back together.  The best thing for a couple is hating other people together.  That's huge.  Absolutely.  That counselor was such a bitch and a cunt that she needed to get her ass kicked.  I was about ready to beat the hell out of her. 
[03:52:00]  And your wife felt the same way.  You know what?  We had the best sex that night.  It was pure hate fucking.  But you know what?  The best shit in the world.  That's great.  There you go.  Hate fucking is awesome.  It's time for the line of the day.  Brought to you by Bodogfight.com.  For all that's happening in the world of mixed martial arts, check out Bodogfight.com.  We got lots of runner-up lines of the day today.  Here's the first one.  Yeah, but at least I can bottom out.  Can you?  How big is your dick?  How big is my dick? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know.  Big enough to bottom out than leaving your old girl.  Corpse.  There you go.  Corpse.  An 11-year-old corpse.  This is horrid.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I've got five kids.  Been married about 18 years.  And, you know, actually, I do have sex regularly.  My wife and I went through some struggles, and it was painful. 
[03:53:00]  Our pussy must look like the hood of a sweat jacket.  Let me get this out.  Hey, Mike in Virginia.  Yeah.  Hey, Louie.  Yeah.  You're speaking my language.  I had my second kid fake orgasms for a year and a half, so I didn't have to pop it out.  It's all in an argument, and I spent $15,000 on IVF.  How do you fake an orgasm?  You're a guy.  Well, I, you know, you just... 
[03:53:30]  You kind of moan?  What do you do?  You pump a little higher and piss in her cunt?  So, you know, I got fucked, and I hate kids.  See you.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Here's another runner-up line of the day, thanks to BodogFight.com.  There it is again.  The cunt kills me.  I've got my daughter saying it now.  Oh.  It's all right.  She should have learned it for her husband's father anyway.  Is she saying, Daddy, stop fucking my...  Oh, my God. 
[03:54:00]  Wow, this really got inappropriate.  Yeah.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard anyone say on this show.  That's pretty bad.  Daddy, stop fucking...  I like that the little girl that's asking to not be raped by her dad uses the word cunt.  Yeah.  Like, you know.  Daddy, please don't fuck my cunt, you old fag.  Well, he never said...  He never said how old she was.  That's true.  She could have been 20.  Yeah.  Here's your line of the day.  Thank you, BodogFight.com.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:54:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Like, how long has it been for you?  Somebody goes, two months?  And now we all have to say two months because you lied.  Why?  It's been longer?  Of course it has.  Two months.  What is your wife?  A whore?  That's unbelievable.  Two months.  Wait for it. 
[03:55:00]  That's Master Poe singing.  That's Master Poe singing When Doves Cry.  We isolated his vocals from the music.  That was him doing Prince.  By the way, is he the guy who does that on the Prince song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God we had the last half hour of the show.  Well, there wouldn't have been.  Absolutely.  Any line of the day.  Oh, we were serious for like three hours today.  Hey, from a very reliable source, Howard believes that Fox negated all his fans' votes to get Sanjaya out, 
[03:55:30]  and he wants an investigation immediately.  What a fucking loser.  What happened?  Did Sanjaya get voted on?  He finally got kicked off, yeah.  Fine, man.  And Howard thinks there's fraud.  Howard thought he had the power to make him the American Idol winner.  So he thinks there's fraud.  Yeah.  While we're all talking about this shooting down there, of course, he's worrying about himself again.  There's fraud, all right.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Unbelievable.  Let's get the plugs in.  Louie, what do you got going on?  Caroline's next weekend in New York City.

Are you just going to walk up to your girlfriend and point at your kiss shirt?  Is that going to work?  It's going to work. 
[03:57:00]  Go.  But first, I've got to set it up like a question for you.  Question for you.  Okay, what?  It's like awkward, but we're both shuffling because she knows I'm going to want physical contact  that she fucking finds repulsive.  Oh, God.  And she's looking at that stream going, oh, God.  Oh, here it comes.  Oh, my God.  You know my favorite band?  And I just kind of stood there waiting.  She's like, yeah.  And I'm like, well, you know.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I do.  I think God died on that date.  I think he watched that and went, something I made did that. 
[03:57:30]  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take it anymore.  Oh, that's.  I like the feeling of, like, embarrassment I get when you tell that story.  It's like a weird, like a bad thing.  It's like I'm a cutter.  And I need, like, that awkward, horrid feeling I get when you tell that story.  Do you get embarrassed for me when I tell that story?  I feel visceral.  Like, I feel physical.  Yeah, it's like this weird feeling I get.  Because, you know, look, I can relate to it and, oh, it's awful.  Yeah, yeah, everybody was like, yeah, it's stupid. 
[03:58:00]  But I mean, as the day wore on and she didn't acknowledge it, I just was like, all right,  I guess we're not going to.  So you thought the day wore on, like, you thought somewhere, like, three hours later,  she'd go, oh, you.  Oh.  Yeah.  I thought it was the Beatles, you dummy.  Yeah.  Hey, they're waiting.  We got a meeting.  We got suits out there.  What?  Yeah, we got a quick little.  Why I.  So we got to go.  Oh, Louie, thank you.  So, very much.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I had a lot of fun.
