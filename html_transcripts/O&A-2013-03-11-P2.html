<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show with Sam Roberts covered a wide range of topics.  A significant portion focused on their recent two-hour interview with David Lee Roth, during which Roth revealed he calls his penis "Little Elvis" and discussed the difficulties of adapting to smaller venues after performing massive stadium shows.  The hosts and Sam Roberts debated the impact of YouTube and readily available online information on the music industry and concert experiences, contrasting it with the often romanticized memories of pre-internet concerts.  They compared the live performance experiences of various artists like Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg, and a caller recounted a story about Glen Hazard stopping a show due to audience members being distracted by monitors.

The show also discussed a Saturday party/show at the studio hosted by Roland, featuring multiple chefs.  This party unexpectedly ran an hour over schedule, clashing with a planned surprise show by Eric, Gittles, and Pat Duffy.  Sam Roberts offered his predictions for the "song of the summer," mentioning Trinidad James.  Finally, the show concluded with promotion of David Lee Roth's upcoming appearance on Jim Florentine's "Boneyard" show and Sam Roberts' own upcoming show featuring Matthew Fox and Mary Lou Henner.  Numerous humorous anecdotes and off-color jokes punctuated the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Three a secs out.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's a legendary day.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I was just molding the future of America just now.  A tour from Syracuse just walked by,  and Ryan from the mashup was giving it.  He's also, he went to Syracuse,  and he opened up the door so they could all see. 
[00:00:30]  I was just thinking, you know, and he said,  oh, it's Sam Roberts, he's getting ready to do his show.  He went to Syracuse.  If I had been on a tour and saw that,  I would have been like, man, I picked the right school.  This is going to be great.  Look at that, the future is bright.  If only those kids knew the truth.  And they saw Gerard Butler in the lobby.  They see Gerard Butler walking up and down the halls.  They see me, and they go,  oh, the glamorous life that that guy must lead.  And he was once just a student like us?  No, couldn't be. 
[00:01:00]  If only they knew, Roland.  Yeah, it was.  If only they knew the truth of what goes on.  They saw Gerard give me a hug, talk.  They're like, wow, they think celebrities hang out.  Yeah.  And they forget, though.  It depends what department you're in.  I guess so.  Well, call us up.  What did you learn?  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  I learned that sometimes the mirror over the bathroom sink  likes to tell you that your shit don't stink.  I hope you isolated some of the best pearls of wisdom  from Mr. David Lee Roth, E-Rock. 
[00:01:30]  I've got a few.  Are you a Diamond Dave fan?  Were you?  You know what?  When I became aware of Van Halen  was right as they were breaking up.  But you didn't follow him to his solo stuff?  I liked his solo stuff.  Just a gigolo?  Like, I knew he was David Lee Roth  before I knew he was in Van Halen.  The only thing that I wish they had tackled  with David Lee Roth today,  and, I mean, that was a great interview.  Two hours with a guy who,  does he stop talking?  No.  Does he have a lot to say?  Hell yes. 
[00:02:00]  He's done everything.  Well, he lived there, I mean,  during the peak of, I mean, the 80s.  Right.  He is, like, most people say,  oh, you've got to talk to this guy.  He lived in, like, the Van Halen era.  David Lee Roth was the Van Halen era.  When they say the Van Halen era,  they're talking about that dude  that was in here tonight.  Yeah, they had the late 70s arena rock scene,  and then going into the 80s,  like Roland just said,  with MTV starting out,  they were there for that as well.  And it was them.  Yeah.  They were the band.  And when they were in heavy rotation.  California Girls was huge. 
[00:02:30]  Right, California Girls,  Just a Gigolo, everything.  I mean, you know,  bands like Poison and all those,  like, they were not Van Halen.  Van Halen was the band.  Dave TV.  MTV almost changed the name of the show,  of the network, to Dave TV.  For the weekend, DTV.  Right.  John in Pennsylvania.  Hey, the great, prime time, Sam Roberts.  Tell those kids from Syracuse.  Oh, well. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, I learned that David Lee Roth  names his penis Little Elvis.  Where else are you going to hear that?  Little Elvis.  Little Elvis is swinging around in those pants.  David Lee Roth.  The one question, though,  that I would have tackled,  after we got past, you know,  what was it like being on stage?  You know, great questions.  Jim asking him,  what was it like to go from 20,000 people  to 2,000 people?  And David Lee Roth answered,  honestly.  He was like,  it kicks your ass  when you really,  you start questioning a lot 
[00:03:30]  about yourself when that happens.  He was really honest.  It was great.  I was expecting a guy  to walk up here  with bleached blonde hair  and spandex,  to tell you the truth.  Maybe I had unrealistic expectations.  That's why he dressed  for the Caf√© Juan show.  He had spandex on?  No, he had the paintings.  What he had on?  He had overalls on.  That's how he dressed.  Well, I would like to know why.  Well, he did say  he never dresses in yellow for men.  All right, but you could,  I don't,  I'm not wearing yellow either,  but I'm not wearing overalls.  But he looked very comfy.  He looked very comfy. 
[00:04:00]  That's probably,  I think when you reach that level  of like rock idol,  I'm going to be comfy.  If anybody can pull off overalls,  it's David Lee Roth.  But I just would have loved the question  just to hear how he would have  tackled that one.  Why the overalls, David?  Well, let me tell you something.  And he would have had something  that rhymed or something  to go with it.  But he was great.  How did we end up getting him  for two hours?  That's always scheduled that way.  He was just like,  hey, I'll stop by.  How long do you want me for?  Two hours, dude.  Yeah, because he said  eight to ten things  that I'll do. 
[00:04:30]  Jimmy's Boneyard after a ten.  That's awesome.  So he's going to be  on Jimmy's Boneyard tonight?  With Jim Florentine.  That's going to be great.  That'll be on the Boneyard tonight.  It was also really interesting  hearing him talk about  how much easier  things would have been.  It's good to hear  perspective  from musicians  from, you know,  20, 30 years ago  talking about  YouTube  and the internet  and how that's changed everything.  It would have made life  easier for them,  but would they have been as big?  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[00:05:00]  Like if,  because that's the problem.  YouTube makes life easier  and makes stuff  like he said.  Bands don't have to carry around  duffel bags  full of cassette tapes  to try to figure out  what sound they want.  You know what I mean?  They just look stuff up  on YouTube,  but at the same time,  YouTube creates  so much more competition  for every form  of entertainment.  I mean,  it's changed everything.  Yeah.  That everything you want  is on the internet  at your beck and call.  Because pre-YouTube,  like you talk about the concert,  it was legendary  and you just,  all the stories 
[00:05:30]  become myth.  Well, the memory  was all it was, right?  Yeah.  Like what you captured  in your brain  and the story you told  was the capturing of it.  It's like the Bruce 4-Hour Show  was always like,  it was never four,  he never did four hours,  but just people would go,  oh my God,  it was like four hours.  So as a Bruce thing,  pre-YouTube.  You'd hear somebody go,  yeah, dude,  he did a four-hour concert  and you're asking him  what songs you played  and you remember  all the songs and everything.  Now you go to a show.  Or you go on the website  and from start to finish  after the show  tells you every set list. 
[00:06:00]  They just publish the set list.  But you also,  half the people  that go to the shows  don't remember  what the set list was.  Everybody's on their phone.  Right,  because they're watching  the concert through their phone  the entire time.  Yeah,  I saw the frames  and they're performing  in the middle of their song.  Glenn Hazard stopped  and he told the guy  to kill all the monitors.  He goes,  everybody was looking  at the monitors,  not at them.  Right.  And he killed it  and everybody started  looking at them  and he goes,  this is a live concert.  I'm here.  You don't have to watch me  on television.  I'm actually in front of you.  He got a little annoyed  because he goes,  look at you guys 
[00:06:30]  and he filmed it  and he put it up there  and you see everybody  just looking at the TV monitors.  Well,  you know,  Jack White refuses  any,  no cell phone photography  at all at his shows.  Oh,  wow.  Like when people,  when people put their phones up,  security is right there  with flashlights  and telling,  put your phones down.  And they make an announcement  before Jack White  goes on stage,  no cell phones.  It's not even for a photo  or anything.  And it's not because  Jack White is afraid  that he's going to be bootlegged,  that his stuff is going to be  on the internet.  It's because he doesn't want 
[00:07:00]  to perform for a group  that are watching the concert  through their phone.  Yeah.  You know?  It takes you out of the moment.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yeah,  you capture it for later,  but you don't have  the memory of it.  You don't remember  what it was like.  You just remember  trying to get your shot centered.  Struff.  Hey,  today on the show  I learned that  128 beats per minute  is the fastest  that you can go  before the girls  start spilling their drinks.  That was really funny,  too.  Thank you,  Struff.  That was,  that was funny,  him breaking down  the science of  how to figure out 
[00:07:30]  how fast music  should be played.  He said 128 BPM  was as fast  as music can be  that a girl can dance  to it without  spilling her drink.  Now,  for Roland,  I would probably say  60 BPM  is about as fast  as it could go  without you spilling  your drink.  10.  10 BPM.  Doom.  Doom.  Yeah.  Just swaying a little bit.  Rick.  Rack in Ohio.  Rack!  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  I learned that  Jim Norton 
[00:08:00]  is going to be  at the funny boat  in Toledo, Ohio,  and I can't find  the goddamn phone number  for it.  You can't just Google  Funny Bone  in Toledo?  I'm driving.  Oh.  Well,  then just figure it out  when you get home.  All right.  I just want to make sure  I get a ticket, man.  Okay.  I'll talk to you later.  I like his Uncle Manny stories.  Do you want the phone number  or no?  Yeah,  I guess.  419-931-3474.  David Lee Ross,  Uncle Manny stories?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Dylan and Richard Pryor.  When he was talking  about living above 
[00:08:30]  the Caf√© Wa there  where the Comedy Cellar is  and that little block  on McDougal Street  in the village  here in New York City  and when you're walking,  like now,  that's where Bob Kelly  does his podcast  and so...  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  He does it right  above the Comedy Cellar.  Oh, wow.  So you're walking  around that area  and you have no idea  the history  that that little block  of space has,  the people that have  walked there.  Yeah, I went with,  I got a quarantine gym.  We went to go see  Van Halen there.  Oh, recently.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, I mean,  literally the ceiling, 
[00:09:00]  if Daley Roth  stood up tall,  it would whack them  in the head.  So he's singing  you might as well jump.  Actually, don't.  No.  Actually, don't.  You don't hurt yourself.  It was insane.  Kevin in Houston.  Hey, guys.  How y'all doing?  What's up?  Who the fuck  actually watches  another person's concert  on YouTube?  I've never understood that  and I go to a lot of concerts.  I can see...  I will watch...  You take the shit out of me.  Yeah, everybody videos  and I'll watch  a YouTube concert video 
[00:09:30]  for seven seconds.  Not even seven.  I'll give it four seconds.  Like, you watch it.  You're like,  oh, the screenshot looks cool.  I would like to see whoever,  Bruce, Jack White.  Oh, that's cool.  See them live.  And you click the video  and you're like,  oh, it's a shitty cell phone video.  This is not what it's like at all.  And you stop watching.  You're right.  Nobody gains anything  out of watching  those concert videos.  All you do is lose  the experience.  All you do is lose  the actual memory  of being there.  What's your... 
[00:10:00]  Bruce is your favorite  live act, Roland?  Um, Bruce, U2,  um, Blake Shelton.  Blake Shelton.  In the frames.  You're putting Bruce  and U2  and Blake Shelton  on the same list.  Yeah, these are the concerts  I attend.  The Muse is really good live.  I said your favorite.  You said U2  and Blake Shelton.  Blake Shelton  puts on a show  that's comparable  to U2.  Differently.  Differently.  He's coming to you  here soon.  Is he?  Yeah.  What do you mean here? 
[00:10:30]  Just serious.  Not this show?  Eh,  the Tuckulator.  Oh, God.  So I hear your concerts  are a lot like U2's.  Eric,  what's your favorite  band to see live?  Weird Al?  I don't go to many  live concerts anymore,  but...  You're a Weird Al type of guy?  Weird Al was good,  but Lady Gaga  was really good.  I gotta tell you,  the bitch can perform.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's another show  that, like,  if you put that on YouTube,  it would look terrible.  I saw her do  a 45-minute acoustic set. 
[00:11:00]  It was...  Where?  It was...  Bono did some  big charity show.  Oh.  But I think Prince canceled,  and he said,  I have my...  My close friend is here.  I just called her last second.  She's only gonna perform  via piano.  And he goes,  come on out, lady.  And then she came out  and did 45 minutes  on piano.  And how did it sound?  Phenomenal.  I...  That's when I go,  wow,  she can really perform.  Right.  And it's weird  that Lady Gaga  can actually sing  and play piano  and is an actual, 
[00:11:30]  legit musician.  So you'd think  somebody would tell her  to stop all the nonsense.  Like,  stop all this bullshit.  Why don't you just sing?  Everybody thinks  you can't sing  because you surround yourself  with all this bullshit.  Yeah,  like Britney Spears  does all those...  Right.  Because Britney Spears  can't sing.  Yeah,  and the Biebs.  Right,  and Justin Bieber  can't sing.  But Gaga  could fucking tear it up.  But she chooses not to.  I think she's just as good  as like a Beyonce.  Beyonce.  I'm glad that you  even pronounced that correctly  because you know  Miss Beyonce  does not appreciate  when you don't pronounce 
[00:12:00]  that little accent  on the E.  Shit happens, dude.  But you...  So Lady...  When did you see  Lady Gaga, Eric?  When the Monsters Ball  hit New York  the first time.  When the Monsters Ball  hit New York.  Are you a little monster  before?  I wasn't before.  But you were after.  I do enjoy her work.  She won you over.  You celebrate  her entire catalog.  I do.  Jack White  is probably my favorite  act to see live.  But yeah,  I mean,  you can't...  Is it a loud show  seeing Jack White 
[00:12:30]  or the White Stripes?  I imagine that  it's just louder  than most concerts.  Yeah, it is.  It's definitely loud.  I mean,  I don't know  if it's necessarily louder  than any other rock show.  And it's not like  heavy metal loud  because there's generally...  You know what I mean?  It's not like there's  heavy electric guitars.  No, no, I know,  but sometimes...  He likes certain  pedals and distortions  of what he does  and I can imagine  that Amplified  can be a loud show.  I saw Soundgarden  not too long ago  and it was too loud  that it actually ruined  the actual concert. 
[00:13:00]  I would assume  Soundgarden's louder  than Jack White is.  But yeah,  I mean,  I didn't come away from...  I've never come away  from a White Stripes  or a Jack White show  saying,  wow, that was a loud concert.  But like Rob Zombie  is a louder show  than Jack White is.  Oh, I saw that too.  You saw...  When did you see Rob Zombie?  With you.  We went to Rob Zombie Ozzy.  Oh, that's right,  at the Garden.  Yeah, that was a great show.  That was a great show.  Even Ozzy was great.  Ozzy had the fire hose  full of foam  and just soaking people.  Jess was so pissed off  she thought it was going  to ruin her leather jacket.  I was like, 
[00:13:30]  look,  we're on the floor  seeing Ozzy play.  The guy is falling apart  but he can still perform  like he's a young man.  Why don't you just enjoy it?  Yeah, that was the difference  in our dates.  Jess was worried about  her outfit getting ruined  and mine was fist pumping  ready to punch somebody  in the face  while she was getting soaked.  Me and Eric's wife  were rocking out  and Eric and Jess  were worried about  their purses being ruined.  I had a nice shirt on.  But Rob Zombie was great, right?  That was the first time  I've seen him.  No, sorry,  second time I've seen him. 
[00:14:00]  Where else did you see him?  On David Letterman.  Oh, that's...  I used to go to Letterman  all the time.  Right.  And he was with White Zombie  and they were playing  and they set the fire alarm off.  Right.  So they taped  the whole performance.  They went to break  and then when they  went to end the show,  Dave was outside  on the fire trucks  talking to them.  All the lights were going off.  People thought it was  part of the show  but it was really  the fire alarm went off  in the Ed Sullivan Theater.  Did people panic?  Nobody knew.  They just sat there.  All the strobe lights  and the sirens 
[00:14:30]  while they were playing  thought it was part  of the White Zombie show  so everyone just sat there.  I wonder how that makes you  feel about your music  when a fire alarm  wah, wah, wah, wah  and everybody's just like  oh yeah, it's a great song.  You know what I mean?  The unreleased version.  Right.  Like somebody's  jackhammering outside  and they're like  yeah, I guess that's  an instrument, right?  They said it was industrial.  Nobody knew  when White Zombie was done  Dave came over  and said thank you.  Paul and the band  were playing.  Then they cut the band short  when the tape went to black  and fire department  and everything came 
[00:15:00]  through the side door  saying everyone had to  get up and leave.  Do you used to go to  do you go to rap concerts?  Have you been to rap concerts?  Not since  the last one I went to  was Jay-Z  again with you  at the Barclays Center.  Yeah, we went to that.  But before that  Barclays, Eric  get it right  it's the Barclays.  Sir Charles has nothing  to do with this.  And nothing since  I guess the early 90s.  I think Jay-Z  is one of the few rappers  that can perform live.  Because I've seen  like a bunch of rappers live. 
[00:15:30]  Kanye isn't great.  Unless you see him  if you see him  at a Jay-Z show  where he's performing  like three songs  then you're like  okay.  But he's either  like I saw him  at Syracuse  when I was there.  It was when he was  still new-ish.  It was big.  Jesus Walks was already out.  But I saw him perform  and stage went to black  after every single song.  And it was just like  it completely killed the vibe.  Yeah.  Because there was no flow  to the concert.  There was no nothing. 
[00:16:00]  The stage just went to black  and then the lights came up  and he did another song  and then the stage  goes to black  then the lights came up.  Or he's taking a pause  midway through the concert  to rant about  Obama and Justin Timberlake.  A few years ago  my wife went  and she said  he came walking through  this big LED screen  that was working  with the projection screen  in the back  so everything blended together.  Had a whole huge intro  everyone was hyped for it  and then all of a sudden  he stops  dead cold  and does a rant 
[00:16:30]  and sucks all the energy  out of the room  and then tries to build it up again  and by the time  you're halfway through the concert  nobody's really  into it anymore.  Because the problem  with Kanye West  he makes it  so  about Kanye West  he makes it so fucking hard  to like him.  You know what I mean?  Like you like the song  you're like  oh that's a good song  oh let me buy this album  oh the whole album's good  I gotta support this guy  I'm gonna buy the t-shirt  I'm gonna go to the concert  I'm gonna do the  but every time he opens his mouth  and the words don't rhyme 
[00:17:00]  every time he opens his mouth  to speak  it's indefensibly bad.  You know what he said  I was reading  there's a quote from him  now he says  I am Picasso  I am Steve Jobs  and he's running down  this list of artists  and saying  that's who I am.  Isn't that the Apple commercial?  Yeah  he's going over  I am Gandhi  he's running over  all the think different ads  no  but  but all I could sit there 
[00:17:30]  when I'm reading this quote is  you know what Steve Jobs  never did?  compare himself to another artist  you know what Picasso never did?  compare himself to another artist  Picasso said  I'm Picasso  Steve Jobs said  I'm Steve Jobs  they didn't run their mouths  about nonsense  or Picasso didn't paint  painting goes  this shit's gonna be expensive  right  right  I don't wanna piss anybody off  but my paintings  are the best of anyone's  it's like no  it makes no sense  what is it?  no  yeah  he didn't do that at all  and Steve Jobs didn't go 
[00:18:00]  and talk about bullshit  he didn't know  if he wasn't talking about computers  he was talking about music  and what did he do?  he took over the music industry  and then he talked about music  yeah  he wasn't just like  oh  I'm Steve Jobs  so everybody needs to hear my opinion on everything  like he saw Ken Burns  he goes  okay I mean his Ken Burns effect  he helped other people develop their  yeah he goes look  I like Ken Burns  so I put the Ken Burns effect in my iMovie  yeah  not like  I am Ken Burns  Ken Burns is an artist  and I am too  I'm Ken Burns bitch 
[00:18:30]  he didn't do it  that's Kanye  he was like look  I invented an iPhone  it's a great phone  and then people bought it  that was what he did  I mean yeah  he hyped his stuff up a little bit  you know what was a funny rap concert that I went to?  Snoop Dogg  because throughout the show  he was drinking actual gin and juice  and smoking weed on stage  and so halfway through the show  he was completely fucked up  and it was obvious  he didn't know the lyrics to the songs 
[00:19:00]  but everybody was like  yeah Snoop Dogg  totally fucked up  halfway through  Coldplay's a fun show  is it a fun show?  Coldplay is not fun music  but the thing is  when you listen to them  oh yeah  the hit after hit after hit after hit  you start realizing  one of those bands  that you forget how many hits they've had  yeah  I saw Tom Petty at the garden  and I totally forgot how many hits  like everything was a hit after hit  yeah but  Tom Petty's hits are fun  oh yeah they're good  Coldplay has no fun songs  except for that  that's the only fun one 
[00:19:30]  and Yellow and Clocks  all those songs are  cut your wrist songs  those are not fun songs  they're really sad  yeah  those are notebook songs  yeah  but for me  they're like Chick Flick songs  exactly  they're Chick Flick songs  yeah  people thought you just said  Chick Flick songs  they're Chick Flick songs  oh but Chick Flick's good too  are you that homophobic?  not for a sandwich  you're all lathered up Roland  you've been there right?  yeah  yeah  what happens?  you're ready to shave  you gotta keep your cheeks smooth right?

[00:23:00]  the man with the golden ear  right  do you have a prediction  for the summer  well  when you say I predicted  that Carly Rae Jepsen  would have the song  of the summer  I'm sure what you meant  to say was  correctly predicted  that Carly Rae Jepsen  would have the song  of the summer  and I did that  with the help  of my friend Troy  who keeps his ear  to the street  and knows what's hot  in the clubs  I think it's a little early  to predict the song  of the summer  right now  but I think by April  we should have  a good selection  I think Trinidad James  is the song  of right now  oh jeez 
[00:23:30]  he was here last week  wasn't he  no he was in DC  oh okay  I tried to get him  on the show  I thought he was here  yeah  when I saw him on the list  I immediately told Liam  Liam  this is the show  that Trinidad James  needs to do  all gold everything  you have that Iraq  do we have that in here  of course you have it in there  it's a giant song  alright hold on  gold all of my watch  and I tried to get him  in here for you  but it didn't work out  that's what's going on  with rap right now  it's just the  most ridiculous songs  that a person can come out with 
[00:24:00]  they're becoming  very successful  and people are singing along  you're singing along  I'm singing along  you got it  it's called  all gold everything  yeah I got it  here  okay don't give me the remix  because he's the only guy  who didn't put himself  on his own remix  he said like  that's the new shit  he took all his vocals out  yeah he said  but he just shows up  in the beginning of the song  and goes  I'm so hot  I'm not even on my own remix  let's play the original  this is the song  of right now  if any of you  are trying to relate 
[00:24:30]  to your kids  this is what your kids  are listening to  Eric you're trying to relate  to your nephews  this is what your nephews  are listening to  they don't listen  yes they  no they don't  yes they do  this is a radio edit  this is the only song  I have in the system here  the profit system  is still loading the music  the lead only had this  oh  well I want to hear  a little bit of it then  I want to hear  how they  how did they make  this a radio version  I don't know  I mean there's so many 
[00:25:00]  foul words in this song  oh my god  do you think people  actually look  alright you can turn it down  that's horrible  that would be why  for a radio edit  that's horrible  that would be why  it's not a success  on terrestrial radio  just yet  although Hot 97  plays it in New York  you'd think  I don't know  yeah they gotta play  something  or maybe they're allowed  to let the n-word  slip through 
[00:25:30]  and all that  I don't know  I don't know  what I do know  is there was a party  in here on Saturday  I don't know if you guys  tuned in  when's Roland's show  going up on demand  I'm guessing today  well  I would hope today  because it was a  it was a party  Roland came in here  Saturday  at 5pm  you know  two days ago  and  he tore the house  down  he walked in  he had like  I don't know  if you saw it  on my Instagram  I posted a picture  at not Sam  there were 20 people  in this tiny little studio 
[00:26:00]  you always hear  Opie and Anthony  talk about how cramped up  the studio is  Roland packed  20 people in here  he had a table  full of food  and booze  for whoever wanted  to have some  he had 5 chefs  in here  all just shooting  the shit  and Roland  just conducting  the food court  he was the guy  he was the Mac  it was the return  of the Mac  is what happened  well that's an old one  that's right  Opie showed up  I was here  Troy was here  Opie showed up 
[00:26:30]  and Opie didn't even  get to go on the air  Who Kid  DJ Who Kid  from after  Opie and Anthony live  he showed up  and he was on the air  what is this  return of the Mac  yeah  now you're just  getting excited  with 90's hip hop  why not  let's bring you back  to college radio days  golden era  no  and I mean  everybody loved the show  let's go to JT  in New York  JT  how you doing  first off  Roland  a sleeper cell 
[00:27:00]  fucking knocked it  out of the park  killed it  my car  after I parked  just listening  well not really  listening to fucking  say one word  every four hours  but still  but this is where  Roland was so smart  he filled up the room  with these  entertaining personalities  that have been  chefs for years  and they're all  famous chefs  and they're all  out of their mind  crazy  unbelievable  and Roland  piped up every like  I don't know  12 minutes  Roland would pipe in  with one sentence  and then let the room go  and it was great  it was great 
[00:27:30]  he would pitch them  underhanded  and they were just  consistently knocking  out of the park  that's right  it was really impressive  and then  just afterwards  can we talk serious  for a second  let's talk  let's talk  what  is there a pool  going on  in regards to  when Dave's  going to be found  dead in his own vomit  why do you say that  because he's  I don't know  if it's a gag  but he seems like  he's fucking  way off center  and he's hurtling  out of control  well yeah  he's a maniac  Dave came in here 
[00:28:00]  and the Dave  that you heard  on Saturday  thank you JT  was stone cold sober  I mean that's just  Dave every day  of his life  Dave followed up  Roland's food court  because what happened  was  Obie was here  and he was off mic  he didn't come  into the studio  and goes  he tells Troy  who's in the other room  Troy this has got to  go on for another hour  I mean this is great  and  we had spoken  to E-Rock  and  he hadn't committed  to doing a show  as of Friday afternoon  and we didn't  he wasn't there yet 
[00:28:30]  he wasn't in the building  yet  when we saw him  so he hadn't committed  to doing this thing  so we had nothing  we hadn't promoted anything  we hadn't scheduled anything  so we were like  okay  and then I slipped  rolling a note  saying dude  it was you know  it was probably  he probably had three minutes  left in the show  I was like  you can go another hour  if you want  and Roland goes  yes I do want  and we took a break  and we did another hour  unfortunately  immediately  as we're announcing  that Roland's food court  is going that extra hour 
[00:29:00]  Eric comes  walking up the hall  unaware that he's just  been bumped  no we heard  because he was going to  do a surprise show  and he brought  he brought his friend  Gittles  and he brought  Pat Duffy  former intern  Pat Duffy  MVP  Hall of Famer  first candidate  crazy man  insaniac  Pat Duffy  what were you  what was the show  going to be  there was a bunch  of different stuff 
[00:29:30]  we were going to talk about  you're not going to tell me  oh no  I may save some  for the next time  if I do it  are you going to do it  I think next time  I'll do it  you see what happened  how did it feel  Eric  to have  doesn't Pat Duffy  live in Pennsylvania  close to it  how did he get here  he came over to my place  and then I brought him in  oh  so how far of a drive  is that for him  wasn't that far  for him to get to my place  still  an inconvenience  nonetheless  how did it feel  to show up here 
[00:30:00]  and find out  and find out  that you'd been bumped  for a second hour  of the food court  honestly it was fine  because I had not  committed to anything  I said I didn't want  to do it  then around 3pm  on Saturday  I was like  you know what  rather than playing  a rerun of something  I'll go in and do it  but it couldn't have felt good  with your friends  there with you  they didn't care  they were just happy  to be up here  you bring Pat  Pat Duffy  cared  okay  this is a guy  who's wanted to get over  for so long  yeah  and he thinks  like every time 
[00:30:30]  he thinks he's got a shot  somebody just comes  and swipes it away  from him  you dangle it  right in front of him  and he's like  I'm not gonna reach for it  I'm not gonna be a sucker  I'm not gonna reach for it  no seriously dude  just reach for it  you can have it  okay I'm reaching for it  and then they pull it away  pull it away  you can't have it buddy  you sucker  why would you reach for it  why would you do that  he wasn't feeling good  Gittles  your other  your friend  who we don't really know  yeah  was probably sitting there  being like  first of all  why is my name Gittles  and second of all 
[00:31:00]  I thought Eric  had some pull around here  and now he's getting  bumped for a food show  oh Gittles didn't care  he didn't care  he was watching the whole  Circus of Roland show  he was just amazed by it  Who Kid was here  he witnessed Eric  get the bump  get the bumper Rooney  have you ever gotten  bumped off a live gig  Who Kid  hell no  Eric man  was here  he's in there  it's humiliating isn't it  I mean Eric was cool  with it man  but that's  I mean do you think  he really was  or was he a little  like oh god  he didn't get called  to get bumped  he got bumped  on some organic shit  he didn't get bumped  because he's wack  he got bumped 
[00:31:30]  because it was like  isn't that worse  like wouldn't you rather  get a phone call  that says you're bumped  instead of like  he was already up here  it doesn't matter  I wasn't committing to  I didn't commit to  doing the show  at that point anyway  but instead of showing up  and being like  I'm here to do my show  and then everybody's like  no you're not  I would think it had to be  like it had to be humiliating  did Pat Dovey  say anything to you  he wasn't humiliated  he was happy  he didn't want to do it anyway  if I had committed to it  and there was promos  and everything running  and then they did it 
[00:32:00]  then yeah  I would have been pissed  I never said yes to it  so why don't you do it  this weekend  why don't you take  the two hours yourself  I can't this weekend  I'm not around  where are you going to be  I'm going to be  helping out some family  doing what  house stuff from Sandy  personal shit  Sandy's over  yeah but the damage isn't  yeah it is  I look at my neighborhood  everything's fine  oh yeah  you weren't on the coast  oh oh  I can't believe you had  David Roth up here  David Lee Roth was up here  for two hours  Van Halen  no breaks  yeah  no breaks  just chilling 
[00:32:30]  get the fuck out of here  with David Lee Roth  in some overalls  for two hours  did you see what he was wearing  is he looking normal  yeah he looks like a normal dude  he's got dark hair  you know  slick back  Van Halen though  but he's not wearing  tight pants anymore  now it's kind of baggy  overalls  nah  like his pants  are looser  he's a homie now  I don't know  like he's a homie  like  like 1992-ish  like he looks like  he might fit in okay  in like a naughty by nature video  Sam check your phone  I sent you the photo 
[00:33:00]  you can show who could  get the fuck out of here  he was up here  yeah  fuck is he at  I think he just finished  recording Boneyard with Jimmy  cause he made me like  white people back in the days  we were actually just talking  to him about that  that black people liked Van Halen  cause he was influenced  by urban music  and their opening acts  they would purposely book  to get the black crowd  coming in there  like Earth, Wind, and Fire  they had on right as  they were about to break  they were the opening act  for Van Halen  Earth, Wind, and Fire  was the opening act  he said that  I didn't know that  but I thought  you know I'm a racist guy 
[00:33:30]  so  I know  he came out with  Running with the Devil  so when that song came out  I decided to be white  right there  cause  and black people  they don't like the Devil  I love the Devil  you can check my  Instagram last night  I had a bit  oh my god  he's on my knees  Clint  yeah I did  Clint in Alabama  hey Slammin' Sammy  what's going on  I just learned that  Pat Duffy is in fact  the Charlie Brown  of radio shows  every time Lucy  puts the ball up  he drives the chicken  Eric is propping 
[00:34:00]  that ball up for him  and then Pat Duffy  shows up  and he's like  just kidding Pat  back on your ass  did you feel bad  that you did that  to Pat Duffy  I didn't do that to him  you got his hopes up  and then you failed  no he begged  the next time  I was going to do something  if he could come up  I said sure  and then this happened  right  I mean this is a guy  who interned for us forever  I saw him  and just  you saw the tear  in his eye right  it was like a whole crew  of crying white people  exactly  he wasn't crying though  no  nah 
[00:34:30]  that was good  you were fine  because you're heartless  everybody wanted their shine  everybody wanted to get  their little shine on  right  isn't that a racist  term  get their shine on  nah  that means you want  to get props  you want to get  yeah but I couldn't  call you  if you called him  a shine  that would be a problem  would you have a problem  with that who kid  I'm lost  I'm white now  so what's a shine  a shine  that's a racist term  is it  yeah  you didn't know about this  what does that mean  oh who kid  if you only knew  you're obviously not white  white people  have so many terms  for black people 
[00:35:00]  that you don't even know  shine  what does that mean  it's just like a black person  for real  yeah  like a shoe shiner  I guess  I don't know where it comes from  do you know where it comes from  Eric  we learned it from Anthony  so I don't know  that's probably the only thing  I hate that black people do  is shine shoes  you wish they wouldn't  I hate that shit  you're walking through  Grand Central  I had to be white  when I saw that  I was like  I'm gonna be white forever  running with the devil  speaking of whiteness  I was following you on Instagram  like you were saying  I told you  everyday life saving times  you have to have a threesome  I didn't know that
