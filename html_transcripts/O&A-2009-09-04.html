<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their upcoming long weekend and subsequently launching into a tirade against listeners who misinterpret their sarcasm, calling them "fucking morons" and "idiots." They referenced a YouTube video showing their pre-show complaining, which was misunderstood by some viewers.  The conversation then shifted to their experiences on Red Eye, detailing how producers edited out jokes about Van Jones, a man who lost a pinky finger in a healthcare protest, a proposed soda tax, the Miss Universe condom-popping contest, and Levy Johnston.  They lamented this censorship, blaming executives and lawyers.  The discussion meandered through Michael Vick's NFL return, the Yankees' winning streak, and a childhood anecdote about finding Playboy magazines.  Caller stories included one about Michael Ray Richardson and another about a five-year-old's encounter with a dog licking her genitals. The hosts then returned to workplace humor and censorship, using graphic language to criticize HR departments and the limitations on workplace fun.  They contrasted the current climate with the more relaxed atmosphere of previous workplaces.  More listener calls and jokes about workplace restrictions concluded this segment.

The next segment started with a discussion about the perceived attractiveness and incompetence of female bosses' assistants, followed by a comparison of the treatment of animated shows (*South Park*, *Family Guy*, *The Simpsons*) versus live-action programs regarding controversial content.  The hosts discussed censorship in these cartoons.  The conversation then turned to workplace policies, specifically the banning of Facebook and the decline in workplace camaraderie due to increased surveillance.  A caller shared a story about extremely strict lunch breaks, and another recounted a restaurant owner's "lap test" for hiring waitresses.  The show then focused on an unspecified reprimand from management regarding their WWE commentary.  The hosts vehemently defended their relationship with WWE, speculating whether the complaint originated from WWE or SiriusXM.  They discussed sponsorships, product integration, and corporate jargon. A potential Guinness sponsorship was briefly mentioned.  More listener calls followed, including anecdotes about workplace monitoring in firefighting and construction, and a teacher forbidden from using the phrase "rule of thumb."  They discussed Kurt Angle's arrest, playing a clip of his emotional news interview.  The segment concluded with discussion of an intern's repetitive promotional pieces.

The following segment heavily featured Kurt Angle's arrest, detailing his account of events, the PFA violation, false claims, and HGH prescription misunderstanding.  The hosts and callers speculated on the events, with some siding with Angle and others questioning his story. Angle's emotional 9-hour jail experience and distressed phone call were recounted, with the hosts mocking his emotional state. A listener called in mentioning seeing Angle on a Chris Angel magic show where he seemingly died.  Jimmy "Superfly" Snooker then called, recounting a bad flight and encounter with an airport driver.  His upcoming performances were promoted, along with banter about a photo for Opie's Twitter. Studio guest Patrice O'Neal joined, discussing a "sausage fest" at Anthony's house, Patrice's grilling skills (and a conflict with Keith), observations about Cleveland, LeBron James, and comparisons between Anthony's large house and Patrice's smaller space.  The segment included detailed descriptions of Anthony's house and further discussion of Patrice and Opie's relationship and an upcoming wedding at Anthony's house.  A post-interview with "Guar Odours," a giant phallus character, was also included.

The next excerpt started with Opie discussing his financial entanglement with his ex-wife and his upcoming wedding, with Anthony making sarcastic comments about the guest list. Patrice O'Neal provided comedic commentary.  The conversation shifted to Twitter, discussing various personalities and their tweeting habits, criticizing MC Hammer and Questlove.  A significant portion focused on musical artists and whether they should play their hits in concert, centering on Neil Young.  A heated debate ensued about Led Zeppelin's alleged plagiarism from Black artists, specifically Willie Dixon, mentioning specific songs and discussing musical plagiarism in general, referencing Jimi Hendrix and Biz Markie.  The conversation returned to Twitter, focusing on the "Tweet Me Some Skin" account and the content allowed on Twitter.  The show concluded with discussions on fatherhood, Travis's new baby (including a humorous, off-color observation about white babies), and Jose Feliciano's rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner.

The final segment began with a discussion about a former colleague, Roland, and speculation about his career.  This transitioned into a brutally honest critique of Steve's new pants, using graphic descriptions. Steve then revealed his wife's pregnancy, leading to a conversation about sex, childbirth, and Steve's personal experiences.  This segued into a discussion about Diddy's numerous children. The latter half focused on Patrice's new West Highland Terrier puppy, which he suspected was retarded.  A caller, Cam, corroborated Patrice's suspicions. Patrice described the puppy's ailments and planned a test to assess its potential developmental problems.  The hosts urged listeners to follow Patrice on Twitter for the test results and promoted Patrice's stand-up shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Friday!  Yes!  Friday!  Yes!  Thank goodness.  I like saying, thank God it's Friday.  Or sometimes I just go, T-G-I-F.  T-G-I-F.  Yes.  My God, man.  We get a long weekend, right?  Yeah, we get a three-day weekend. 
[00:00:30]  We've become real smart.  Finally.  Three days.  We take two weeks, come back a week, do a long weekend.  Do a week.  Yeah, and then it's long weekend time.  Yeah, and then next week we've got a short week.  Yeah, I think it works out good because if we would have last Monday off,  like if last Monday was Memorial Day, or Labor Day, I mean,  then it would have been over.  Yeah, that's not good.  I would have been sitting here going, well, we've got a weekend,  but then Monday we're back.  But now, it's a long weekend.  Is it your turn to take a sick day? 
[00:01:00]  Three-day week?  Yeah, I think it is.  All right, good.  Yeah.  And then in about a week and a half?  Yeah, a week and a half or so.  All right, midweek.  Just make it midweek.  I like splitting up the weeks.  I like that too.  It makes the week go by really quick.  All of a sudden on a Wednesday I'm playing golf or something,  then come back for two days?  When you can jump from Tuesday to Thursday.  You jump from Tuesday, which is the day after Monday,  to Thursday, which is the day before Friday.  Right.  It's like it didn't even work.  By the way, people, this is jokes.  Yeah.  And this is sarcasm.  Fucking morons.  You idiots. 
[00:01:30]  There are a couple of really moronic people out there.  And I love the people that get it and just pound the idiots.  Yeah.  That's my new thing.  Pound the idiots that claim to be fans of the show  but don't know the basics of this radio show.  I've been listening to years, and, you know,  it really disappoints me when you've got...  If you've been listening for years, you maybe should understand sarcasm.  I really hate, you know, tearing down the curtain,  but you got it from time to time.  I would say 95% to 97% of what you hear on this show is just jokes. 
[00:02:00]  It's just bullshit.  And then 2% to 3%, we get real serious.  Yeah.  And then you get uncomfortable.  And then we go back to the jokes.  Yeah.  And there's also something called sarcasm that I think we're the best at.  That would be 99% of the show.  And if you don't understand sarcasm, then you have no business,  and I mean no business, listening to this radio show.  Turn it off.  No business.  Yes.  I put up a video yesterday on my YouTube channel 
[00:02:30]  where it's literally what goes on right before we turn the mics on.  Yeah.  And me and Ann are bitching like,  oh, God, why can't it be 1030?  Oh, Sam, can you fast forward the clock?  Blah, blah, blah.  Just bitching and complaining, right?  I got to see that one because I remember you taping it.  Yeah.  Or videotaping it, filming it, whatever it is, chipping it.  And I was like, oh, that's probably pretty funny.  It was funny.  Yeah.  And it was very sarcastic.  Yeah.  And then, you know, I check out the comments, 
[00:03:00]  and there's a couple people go,  well, if you're so miserable, you guys, then why don't you just quit?  Blah.  It's like, you're kidding, right?  Yeah.  And then you got to read it like five or six times.  You're like, you're trying to see.  Maybe he's being sarcastic, but then you realize, yeah.  I do give people the benefit of the doubt when I read some of this stuff.  I'm like, all right, is he being sarcastic?  Is there a humor in there?  What is going on?  And then I read it a bunch of times, and I realized, no,  the guy is just an idiot.  Yeah.  He took this video I made as being serious, that we hate being here. 
[00:03:30]  We hate doing radio.  Like we want to document how miserable we are on video and pop it up on Twitter.  And then, you know, the guys that get it, you know, pounded them pretty good.  But then I had a reply, which I rarely do.  I rarely deal with these idiots.  And I had to write, silly goose, hate to tear down the curtain, but it's just a joke.  It's called sarcasm.  You're kidding, right? 
[00:04:00]  Well, I'm getting here.  It's because you got to use the winky face on the Internet to elicit sarcasm.  So one of us has to winky face?  You got to winky face.  You know what?  That's a good point.  From now on, when we make these sarcastic videos, how we hate what we do, hate our lives,  just look for one person winking.  Winky.  That'll be your clue.  Right.  That we're just fucking around.  Just kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hate what I do so much, and Ant hates what he does so much, that all we do is give  you extra hate what we do. 
[00:04:30]  It was funny, because it was like right before the mics went on, too.  And we're just like, oh, God, what time is it, Sam?  Yeah.  Could you push the clock forward a little bit?  I mean, you know, that's what a lot of us think anyway.  Yeah.  I mean, we all want to have the easiest day possible, right?  Right.  When it comes to work or-  No matter what you do.  Or making a living.  Exactly.  But if I really hate what I do, I wouldn't be tweeting.  I wouldn't be making videos.  No, job rules.  I would just be punching the clock.  Yeah.  I don't really like how we're treated yet, but I'm hoping that will turn around eventually. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, there's a few things.  You know, I don't think any job is perfect.  You know, and it is true.  We try to get out of here as quick as possible.  And people are confused by that.  That is a fact.  We try to get out of here as quick as possible, because people that wear ties in this business,  their whole job is to bring you down.  Man.  It's true.  Yeah.  So if we could avoid them, it's actually good for the radio show.  That's why we bolt.  And I'm not even joking about that. 
[00:05:30]  No joking, no sarcasm.  Guys in suits, you have to avoid if you do radio.  Yeah.  At all costs.  Yeah, for the most part, it's just a downer.  You just go out and, oh, you had a good time, you had fun, and then it's, oh, okay, what  do you want?  Yeah.  Ugh, we gotta have this talk about this or that.  Right.  So there you go.  I hope that clears it up for a few idiots out there.  Or they might just be, you know, haters that don't even like the show, but they're obsessed  with just, you know, hating on everything. 
[00:06:00]  I ran into a little of that last night, as a matter of fact.  Really?  What happened?  On Red Eye.  Yeah, how did that go?  I like Red Eye.  We have a lot of fun.  Greg is funny.  Andy, the whole crew over there, really cool guys.  Hang out.  It's a lot of fun.  Joking about everything.  But then it seems like maybe some of the upper echelon over at Fox are starting to  come down on them a little bit.  Oh, see.  Yeah, because... 
[00:06:30]  Have we been there a few times?  I've noticed now from the first couple of times I've been on the show till now, a few  scalpel maneuvers to the material.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And stuff that would have just been nothing.  That means the show's on someone's radar.  Someone, yeah, someone watched it.  It's on someone's radar.  And a couple of things were blatantly cut out from last night's broadcast. 
[00:07:00]  I was watching and going like, wow, I can't believe they cut that out.  What was cut out?  Everything I said.  Oh, really?  It wasn't everything I said, but...  Did they chop your appearance?  I haven't seen it yet.  Yeah, they did.  First, I went in and a lovely lady pulled me aside and she had...  See, when you go on that show, they send you the subject and you send back over like talking  points.  Yeah, some of your thoughts.  Yeah, a few thoughts on...  Where you might go with certain things. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Stuff like that.  Sure.  And...  Which, by the way...  Yeah.  Sucks.  It's a little weird.  And I know they have to do it and I...  Yeah.  I mean, Greg and Andy Levy and the rest of those guys, they can work off the cuff.  Yeah.  They're very good.  We work off the cuff.  We have some general ideas and we go with it.  Sometimes we fall on our faces, but it's a...  You know what I mean?  And it just feels better to do it this way.  Could you imagine if we had to prepare every little statement and stuff like that?  There are a lot of shows that do that.  Like a lot of radio shows that do that and they suck. 
[00:08:00]  A lot of radio shows and a lot of TV shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, unfortunately, you can't just go on the air being a talent.  Yeah.  Knowing what you're talking about and just going with it.  They have to kind of check your...  I'm just kind of like, you know, spelling it out for listeners.  They have to check your shit before you go on.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  And it kind of...  I think it sets up the host.  Of whatever show you're doing with that format.  It sets the host up so they're able to kind of lead you into the direction you want to  go in with what you want to say, which is fine. 
[00:08:30]  And I don't even really have a problem with that because it's actually...  It helps with your writing.  Like I've noticed it really does help if you take a subject and now you have to actually  think and write something out with some type of humor to it or an idea.  It does help with your writing.  So I really don't have a problem with that.  But when it is used to kind of go over and go like, okay, this, this, that... 
[00:09:00]  So I have a couple of the things here that I wrote for last night's show.  And the producer, one of the ladies came over to me and said, let me just talk to you a minute  about a couple of things.  And I instantly went, I went out loud.  I went, uh-oh.  You did say that?  Yeah, I went, uh-oh.  So she goes, oh, there's just a couple of issues with a couple of things.  And they always try to downplay it.  They're like, oh, you know, I just, we just need to talk about a couple of things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That means they got major problems with what you're about to say or write, and they're 
[00:09:30]  going to make sure you don't say or write those things.  And I don't even blame, I don't blame her.  I don't blame anyone on the show.  I blame executives.  I blame suits.  I blame lawyers.  I blame people that, uh, that kowtow to fucking, uh, interest groups that get letters  from people and all of a sudden just knee jerk, uh, and pull whatever that person writing  said to pull.  Uh, that's who I blame.  Yeah.  And scared executives.  And radio and TV could be so much better if, if those people would just go away or, or 
[00:10:00]  they could still go to work, but just keep their, their, their mitts out of the creative  process.  I mean, you would get way better TV if people would just relax and let the creative, uh,  you know, talented people just do their thing.  Just let them roll.  Just let them roll.  Let them roll.  It's your job.  I mean, not to make any excuses, but when we, I know, I mean, this is.  Okay.  Cause this is all, this is all the same thing.  All encompassing.  When we were on regular radio again, holy crap.  They made it tough.  Oh, and I'm not making excuses. 
[00:10:30]  You know, I, I, I, to this day, I'm proud of what we did when we went back to regular  radio.  We did an amazing job with what we were given, but they just made it so hard and you want  to sit these guys down.  And we did try and go, will you just fucking relax and let us do what you hired us to do?  Let us just do the goddamn job.  And that's the answer to why TV is shit.  Why most radio is shit is because these people are just over controlling everything.  Yeah.  But anyway, back to last night.  Sorry.  Uh, so she came up and one of the problems was, uh, here's, here was some of the subjects. 
[00:11:00]  Uh, the guy that got his finger bit off, um, at one of these healthcare, uh, protests, demonstrations,  a guy, apparently, this was kind of a funny story.  The guy's driving by this, um, demonstration of these people that are for Obama's healthcare.  He's against it.  He drives up and, uh, some guy starts yelling at his face.  So he punches him in the face like three times when he came back with his fist. 
[00:11:30]  The third time his pinky was gone.  The guy bit his fucking pinky off.  Uh, another one is this, this green czar, Van Jones.  Wait, what about the pinky?  Did you have a line that they cut?  Uh, no, no, they didn't cut anything out of that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I just brought up something of how, well, if it was like Obama's healthcare plan, uh,  he'd be sitting there with his pinky for a week in a hospital waiting room and they'd  sew on like a raisin for his, uh, whatever was left.  Nothing hysterical there.  I just thought the story itself is pretty funny.  Right.  It punches him and comes back without a pinky. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  But this whole thing, the green czar, this Van Jones is, uh, the, the jobs, green jobs,  uh, you know, the whole green movement czar.  That Obama just appointed.  This guy is one of the biggest racists ever.  That's coming from me.  This guy is a black guy, uh, gets the job, uh, with, without being elected in or anything.  Obama's just appointing these czars.  And, um, there's some clips of him coming up that are just amazing. 
[00:12:30]  He calls himself a communist.  Calls himself a communist.  Uh, so.  He actually calls himself a communist?  Yes.  Okay.  He said he, he's a communist.  Uh, and, uh, just a racist.  He's an awful, awful man who, uh, shouldn't be, uh, have, have any type of influence, um,  uh, to the president.  He's horrible.  Throw him out.  Um, so the whole thing was, uh, about him, uh, just saying that, uh, the Republicans are 
[00:13:00]  assholes or something.  He said in one of his speeches, he used asshole and shit like that.  Uh, I just said that it's kind of cool, uh, it's bringing the word commie back because  you haven't been able to use the word commie.  And then I said something like, he's a red green czar.  I go red and green.  You know what that makes?  Brown.  Nuff said.  Like a red green czar.  It's a paint joke.  It's a joke about paint mixing paint.  And, um, woof.  Woof.  They said no way.  No.  Did you use it on the show though?  And they cut it out? 
[00:13:30]  No.  I was able to put, say red green czar.  But I wasn't able to use the color joke, which is kind of the kicker.  Yeah.  That's, that's, that's the punchline.  They're like, well, you know, the race thing, but they're very sensitive about that.  Very sensitive.  And then the, um, the soda tax, uh, thing.  They want to start taxing soda and other fat, um, food because it, uh, hurts people's health  and it winds up costing a lot of money for diabetes and obesity and heart disease and everything  else.  So, uh.  Which, by the way, they don't care about all those things. 
[00:14:00]  No.  They want money.  It's just another excuse to get money.  They don't care about the individual.  Yeah.  I hope people understand that.  So, uh, I said it's going too far.  We need fat people around.  They're really the last people we can make fun of without getting into too much trouble,  which is true.  Could always make fun of fat people.  They really don't.  They might get mad, but they don't have a, like a fat group that really has any power.  Um, and I said, I do like how I was going to say, I do like how they're fighting against  this tax, uh, they're revolting and revolting, which, you know, it's all right, people look, 
[00:14:30]  this isn't my top of the line shit here.  It's for television.  Uh, but, but it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're, you're, it's just revolting and revolting.  I thought it was kind of funny because it's a revolt and they're revolting.  You don't have to make any excuses.  It's a great line.  And to, to see that on TV in the moment would be very funny.  You know, I'm right now it's in the context of, I couldn't say one word of that, that  whole thing.  I can't make fun of the fact that we can make fun of them.  And I couldn't say they're revolting and revolting. 
[00:15:00]  I was just able to say, uh, it's good to see them.  Uh, they're revolting.  It's just like what we, we started the show with.  It's just a joke.  What's the problem with joking about that people being revolting?  Then, then there's this, um, uh, Miss Universe contest where I guess part of the, um, thing  now is for them to fill up condoms with water and blow them up to see if they, to pop them.  And it's supposed to be some kind of condom awareness thing, but obviously it's just some  sexual thing for Miss Universe to do. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, and some people are kind of upset with, with the fact that they have to do this now.  And Donald Trump says there's no, no problem with it.  Wait, is it part of the competition?  Apparently.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some of the preliminary or something.  Really?  Yeah.  And what do they have?  They fill it up with water and then blow up?  They fill them up with water and then, or they blow them up, make them real big and pop  them.  Right.  Right.  And it's just some kind of a condom use awareness thing that they were part of.  Uh, so, uh, I, I was asked about it and I just said, you know, first of all, what, 
[00:16:00]  what's, what's a condom?  Um, you know, because I'm always talking about how I just don't use condoms.  Right.  And, uh, then it stopped right there in the show.  It was a boom for a cut because after that I said, I have no problem with this.  I'm even willing to help them fill the condoms up myself.  If she just helps out a bit to fill the condoms up myself was cut out.  They didn't want me to saying, fill the condoms up myself. 
[00:16:30]  Now, even though it's based on context.  Yes, of course.  It's fine.  I'm not saying I want to put my cock in a condom and shove it in Miss Universe.  Well, you're kind of applying that, but it's, it's like, it's that, it's the famous  double entendre humor.  Double entendre.  That is, uh, done very well over the years.  Exactly.  Then another thing that got cut out, dude, I, this is all the shit that was cut out.  Uh, the first two things that I mentioned, I wasn't able to say, and I didn't say, but  this is shit that's cut out now. 
[00:17:00]  Um, who's this?  Uh, Levy, Levy Johnson.  Is that his name?  That fucking, or Johnston, Levy Johnston, the, the guy that was engaged to be married  to Pelosi's, uh, Pelosi.  Oh shit.  What a difference that is Palin.  I'm distracted because I see the video of, uh, one of the contestants blowing up the  condom.  Yeah.  Wow.  Those condoms get pretty fucking big, huh?  Dude.  Is that big for a condom?  I believe we were from Arkansas.  Why are we always paranoid that they're going to break?  You see how big that fucking thing got? 
[00:17:30]  I think it was giant.  I think we need this awareness.  I see.  That's a good thing.  Where was that video?  TMZ?  Yeah.  I saw a TMZ logo on that one.  Oh, it's on YouTube.  Yeah.  It's YouTube.  It's everywhere.  Okay.  You can find it yourself.  If you just Google news, like, condom, it'll be, like, the first thing.  All right.  Right on.  Right on.  So now this is stuff that you actually said that got cut on the show, but when you watched  it yourself, it was, it was not there.  It was cut out.  Yeah.  It just wasn't there.  It was an awkward cut. 
[00:18:00]  Uh, uh, Levy, uh, Johnston, um, who was the guy that got, uh, Palin's daughter pregnant.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he apparently said he would pose nude in Playgirl.  And the whole joke is that girls don't even fucking look at Playgirl anymore.  Right.  Guys look at Playgirl.  There isn't even a paper publication of Playgirl.  It's only online.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And it's, it's completely gay.  Like, no woman is looking at Playgirl.  Did women ever look at Playgirl?  I don't think so. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, when we were growing up, it was all about the Playboy, but you didn't have, like,  It's like, come on, come on.  But you didn't have, like, the girls in your school, like, talking about Playgirl at all,  right?  Look, a cock.  No.  They just weren't.  The girls just don't.  No.  They just don't look at us as, like, visually, like we look at them visually.  No, we stare.  For the most part.  And jack it.  I know there's women out there that do, but for the most part, you know. 
[00:19:00]  But especially in this day and age, you're not going to grab Playgirl if you're some  chick.  No.  You just go online.  You don't hear the stories of the chicks, like, trying to find the stash of Playgirls  and then burying them in the woods.  Yeah.  At their tree fort.  I found my mom's Playgirls.  Right.  So I went out with the rest of the girls and we looked.  I've never heard one of those stories.  No.  But you just walk around talking to, like, you know, older guys and everyone has a story  of finding the stash of Playboys.  Oh, and you'd find a stash of your dad's Playboys and it would glow like this fucking 
[00:19:30]  suitcase in Pulp Fiction.  Your dad had a stack?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See, my dad didn't.  So.  Oh, man.  What was cool for me was having that friend whose father subscribed to Playboy.  Great.  And then you're getting to know, like, your new buddy and he's like, oh, yeah, my dad subscribes  to Playboy.  I'm like, what?  Could we?  Dude, could we look at him?  Of course.  Yeah.  Come here.  And you're like, you start getting butterflies.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm going to see naked girls.  Holy shit.  I'm going to see naked girls.  It was ridiculous. 
[00:20:00]  Just knowing that that friend's father had that stash.  Can we see him?  When is he leaving to play golf?  Can we see him?  And where's Mom?  Oh, she's downstairs, you know, making cookies.  Oh, they are.  And then you'd grab one.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Danny just found a picture of some naked guy swinging from a tree.  No.  Travis sent me this.  Oh, Travis.  Is that from the personal Travis collection?  I would imagine.  That looks like an ant eater.  Oh.  Nice crabs.  He's got a hell of a cock on him. 
[00:20:30]  At least his abs are real, unlike what's-his-name from Guar yesterday.  Odorous.  Odorous, right.  Not like odorous abs.  Odorous's abs made me laugh all night long.  It was hysterical.  It was like he fucking put him in with charcoal.  Yeah.  But anyway, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, it's cool.  We're just yapping.  Yapping.  Levy Johnston, who is the guy that knocked up Palin's daughter, he wants to pose for Playgirl.  Well, the whole thing is, what did I say? 
[00:21:00]  I said, of all the people in the Palin camp, if I made a list, he wouldn't even be on it  as far as the people I want to see naked.  And I said, I would love to see that daughter that he knocked up, though.  They cut that out.  The daughter that he knocked up.  Now, I know there was controversy with Letterman about that, but he did knock the daughter  up.  Right.  She was the older one.  There's no confusion as to which one got knocked up.  Right.  So, you know, that was the line. 
[00:21:30]  So they cut that out.  Just nervous Nellie's trying to do edgy material.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about Greg and Andy Levy and the rest of them.  No, no.  The executives are working in a field where they're trying to get some edgy programming  done, but they're nervous Nellie's.  Yeah.  How is that ever going to work?  Just real, a little over safe.  A little over safe going on.  And there was something else they cut out, I believe.  I can't recall what it is, but I was watching just kind of going, whoa. 
[00:22:00]  Really?  A little over safe.  And this is after the talking to and me just not doing the lines that, you know, they said,  you know, we kind of steer away from that.  It's like, oh, man, come on.  Just let these guys do their show.  Of course.  Oh, fucking.  That's why I watch TV instead of do TV.  I like to watch TV.  And by the way, it finally explains my Letterman appearance with Anthony.  It's not that I didn't talk a lot. 
[00:22:30]  My stuff was so racist.  Oh, my God.  They just cut every word I had out of my appearance with Anthony.  How many N-bombs did you drop?  Oh, I can't count that high.  Like a crazy person.  I made Michael Richardson look like a churchgoer.  Richards.  Richards.  Michael Richards.  It's still early.  Michael Richardson, I think, played in the NBA.  Did he?  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Mike in Philly.  Mike?  How's that Michael Vick doing? 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Yo, you're talking about.  All right.  Or you're talking about whatever.  You know, sometimes we like to kind of have a conversation.  Like, we're all buddies.  He doesn't want to.  He's strictly business.  No, the Eagles and the Jets played last night.  So I'm just wondering if you're an Eagles fan.  And what do you think about Michael Vick?  I'm an Eagles fan.  And the way I look at it, Michael Vick didn't kill my dog.  That's Philly.  That is Philly.  Hey, right on, Mike.  All right.  What do you got?  Hey, we're in the house one time.  We're probably 10 years old.  The old man had his Playboy stashed up in the drop ceiling. 
[00:23:30]  And I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Because we're sitting around watching TV.  And the Playboys and every other penthouse found us.  The whole ceiling caved in.  It was like manna from heaven.  Come on.  It's like there is a God.  I swear on my father's been dead 10 years this year.  And I know how it is with your dad.  I swear on his grave.  That's what happened.  Wow.  Could you imagine?  It's like, oh my God.  Could you imagine?  This is a gift from heaven. 
[00:24:00]  God.  A gift from God.  Thank you, God.  That's a good one, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  Now he's listening to himself.  All right.  That's what you do.  That's fine.  You're listening to yourself.  Hi.  So what else is going on?  I guess they finally buried Michael Jackson last night.  Did they?  Buried Michael Jackson.  Like a year?  Yeah, about a year ago.  Dude.  I don't know.  Whatever.  We don't really need the details.  But he's finally on the ground.  Well, Liz Taylor was there.  Al Sharpton. 
[00:24:30]  Al Sharpton.  Oh, God.  Of course, Al Sharpton.  Barry Bonds.  What the hell is he doing?  Did he know Michael Jackson?  Wow.  Oh, this guy has all sorts of info on Michael Richardson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  This is worth taking.  This is the guy.  He was a bad boy.  Dan in Albany.  Go ahead.  Yeah, what's up, O?  You know, Michael Ray Richardson was thrown out of the NBA twice for excessive cocaine abuse.  Yeah.  He had a couple of domestic violence charges against him.  And then he came up to Albany to become a minor league basketball coach and was run out of town after explaining to the media how he had big-time Jew lawyers that could help get him out of trouble. 
[00:25:00]  I love this guy.  Yeah, he was one of a kind, this Michael Ray Richardson.  He was an amazing player, too.  I hope he's still second all-time in steals, but the guy was a maniac.  Is he really second all-time steals?  Co-Kane!  Co-fucking-Kane.  There you go.  There's your Michael Richardson update. 
[00:25:30]  Thank you, Dan.  Yeah.  Wow.  The other thing from Red Eye you didn't mention about the high school reunion.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  At the end of the show, Andy asks me, he goes, so, Anthony, you recently went to your high school reunion.  I was like, yeah, yeah.  I took an 18-year-old to it.  I figured I was going to be, what did I say?  I said I was the ghoul of the ball or something, just the creep.  And then he goes, oh, someone said, oh, did she make it home all right? 
[00:26:00]  And I went home.  I started talking about how now she's in a vault in the basement of the compound.  I'm going to have her impregnated and stuff like that, you know, kind of goofing on the news story about the guy that.  Yeah, it's only the biggest news story right now.  Yeah.  And that part, so it goes, so did she make it home all right?  I went home.  Boom.  Cut right there.  Yeah, yeah.  What is the problem with saying that? 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what the problem is with saying, no, she's locked in my basement.  Yeah, just referencing a big news story.  Yeah, goofy.  You know something?  She really isn't locked in my basement.  Right.  Do I have to explain it to people?  Are people going to be upset with that?  It's, you know, a joke.  I think Red Eye's in trouble.  I don't, I really hope not.  I think they're on the radar.  They are.  You never want to be on the radar.  They are on the radar, which is a good thing if you're a show, you want to be on the radar. 
[00:27:00]  Well, I was going to say the opposite.  Our best years when we weren't on the radar.  Yeah, could do anything.  I mean, it was, it was the best years of our career.  You listen to some of those shows and you, you would swear.  And you, we couldn't even do that on satellite.  Right.  And I remember, I remember bosses that were kind of smart.  I think it might've been Bruce Midman.  He's like, you guys are not on the radar yet.  Yeah.  And he was worried when that day would finally come. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  And he would keep warning us.  Stay on the radar.  You're not on the radar.  You're not on the radar.  Stay off the radar.  Yeah.  Stay off the radar.  And then of course, uh, we told the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery  car wreck.  And guess what?  Radar hit.  We've been on the radar ever since.  Yeah.  And it's a different world.  Ever since.  It's a different world.  We, uh, actually when we first got to New York, we were off the radar too.  A little bit.  Cause, uh.  A little bit.  Yeah.  We, we got away with quite a bit of murder over there.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  But.  Yeah.  By the way, she was 17, not 18.  People want to correct you.  Only for a couple of days.  Okay.  But they want to correct you.  Which is closer to 18 than 17.  Good point, Ed.  Good point.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Uh, getting back to Michael Vick.  He's going to be able to play starting in week three.  Oh, really?  See, I thought he was able to play right away and, uh, I was wrong.  I cannot wait.  Week three, he gets to officially be, uh, reinstated in the NFL.  You know what the ratings are going to be for the first game he actually plays in?  That's ridiculous.  That's televised?  Of course.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:28:30]  He, uh, I, just to see, I will tune in just to see what the fans do, uh, as far as goofing  or, or, or just taunting him about the dog thing.  I'm not a fan of the Eagles by any stretch.  And, you know, I got a lot of roots in Philly these days.  Yeah.  I could take a peek at the Phillies.  I could take a peek at the Flyers, 76ers, and Eagles I could care less about.  But man, every time the Eagles are on, I will watch that game.  Yeah, now you're going to watch. 
[00:29:00]  I will watch every freaking, uh, you know, down.  They're very, they're very smart with picking them up.  And your dumb Yankees won again.  The fucking Yankees are great.  They are on a tear.  Fucking another double digit game.  10-5 over the Blue Jays.  Cranking, jacking that ball.  They have hitting and pitching.  It's fucking fantastic.  They're, uh, they're killing.  I think, uh, did Boffiston win last night, too?  Uh, Boffiston.  Yeah, Boffiston won.  Red Sox also won, so.  What are we, seven and a half games up, I believe. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, you guys are going to win the, you know.  It's looking good.  I don't want any self-destruction.  That ain't happening.  And the poor Mets.  Oh, my God.  Enough about the Mets.  Oh, by the way.  Not enough about the Mets.  They look like a pile of busted toys.  Remember we were talking about David Wright and his dumb helmet yesterday?  Did I?  Yes.  Now, hold on.  I gotta go get the paper.  Oh, give me the, give me, uh.  Get the paper, get the paper.  Give me that piece of shit, the top one.  Ah.  You call it, whatever, I call it a piece of shit paper. 
[00:30:00]  Not even good for a toilet paper.  Nope.  But.  Wouldn't let my bird shit on it.  Nope.  If I had a bird.  Let me see.  Remember yesterday we were saying that, uh, maybe we weren't the first ones.  I thought we might be, though, that David Wright's helmet looks like the Great Gazoo.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Do they, do they make a little animation?  Wow.  These papers, you know what?  These papers are the exact same paper.  It's in the other paper.  I thought it was in this paper.  The Daily News. 
[00:30:30]  Ah, there's Jorge.  They're not.  Sada fucking cranked.  They're just as bad as the other paper.  Who am I kidding?  Ah, let's see.  Sorry about this.  I'm just going to be on Fox Business News.  Yeah.  You hear this deal, though?  Fox Business Network, they're going to simulcast IMUS.  Yeah.  But they're filling the screen up with all the business facts?  Because it's prime time.  Oh, no.  It's going to be a little block of IMUS.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a little, uh, square in a bunch of numbers.  Oh, what the hell is this, stupid? 
[00:31:00]  He will share the screen with rows and columns of business data and updates.  The bottom third of the screen and a wing down the right side will provide continuous business information.  Information, said the spokeswoman.  Ah, yeah.  So he's going to be a little postage stamp on TV.  What's, uh, Yahoo doing?  Ah, I'm going to look over here and see what Google's doing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Google, baby.  Yeah.  He's going to be a postage stamp.  That's it. 
[00:31:30]  And I can't find this damn thing.  God, we've been rocking, too, and I had a stall to do this.  Oh, wait.  Was that his helmet?  No, yeah, but it's, uh, I think it was, uh, Phil Mushnick.  His helmet.  Phil Mushnick.  I think it might have been Phil.  I hate Phil Mushnick.  Could someone find this for me?  What the fuck?  What paper was I reading?  Find it for him.  What paper was I reading?  Maybe you had a different edition.  Oh, okay.  You ever, you ever noticed sometimes?  You ever noticed?  I bet you that's what's happening.  Sometimes there's different editions of the paper. 
[00:32:00]  What the fuck?  Uh, someone's saying it was Newsday that mentioned, uh, the Great Gazoo.  Might have been.  Maybe it's one of those.  I call it Snooze Day.  Oh, God.  Newsday is the worst newspaper.  Horrid.  Have you seen this wrestling commercial yet?  Uh, no.  Oh, all right.  Damn it.  It's Eric Gioi.  Gioi.  How do you say that Italian name right there, Ann?  Help me out.  I don't know.  Uh, uh, uh, Eric Gioi.  Gioi.  It's a political commercial, and to show his opponent, he shows old-time wrestling footage 
[00:32:30]  from, like, the early 50s.  Really?  Of a wrestler just spinning a guy in the ring by his legs over and over again.  Is he co-hosting on Saturday with Sam?  And Stryker.  Can't find that, huh?  Let me say, uh, I think, give me the other papers.  I think Ann's right, though.  It was a different edition. 
[00:33:00]  Josh in D.C., what's up?  Hey there, Josh.  Hello, Hinsky.  Hinsky with your best shotgun.  Yeah, Hinsky.  Unbelievable.  Ann, I think the reason that Fox or any other channel cuts out what you're saying is I don't  think they want to be associated with you if, for some reason, you go ahead and do those  things.  But, um, you know, God forbid you abduct a girl, I mean, hey, props to you, but, you  know, God forbid you do.  Right.  You know, they don't want to think, hey, this guy's associated with us, and now Fox News 
[00:33:30]  or MSNBC or whoever the hell it is, they're going to think, oh my God, this guy said this  on our show, and now we're going to get in trouble for it.  And, you know, that's what it boils down to.  You know, I don't know, I don't know if I, it's like, I, obviously I'm not being singled  out.  It's, uh, they just really don't want, uh, they don't want to take those chances.  The more popular a show gets, the less chances people want to take.  Yeah.  And the reason the show got popular in the first place is because of the chances.  So it's like, it's a catch 22. 
[00:34:00]  It is.  And even in like the workplace, if you make a joke about something, and obviously we know  the workplace is way different than TV and radio, but the workplace, if I'm not  I made a joke about abducting a girl, I'm going to be in psychiatric health for the  next time.  Well, you'd probably be in jail.  Uh, they would arrest you in jail.  Yeah.  This job, we could kind of make fun of things like that and abduction and things like that.  But, uh, if you're just in your cubicle and you go, Hey, I think I'm going to abduct  that girl.  You get in trouble.  You're done.  We do have a few liberties here, I guess. 
[00:34:30]  You guys should just like do your job with microphones in front of you.  Yeah.  Just walk around your office and your cubicle with a microphone in front of you.  I get away with a lot more.  I have you guys on all the time and I'm always worried you're going to say something that  someone's going to get offended about.  And it's almost like, but they're just making jokes.  Yeah.  They're just, they're just joking.  They're just jokes.  We say some horrific things on our show and then we go to break and you really have to  put a filter on because now you're seeing people in the hallway and you want to just  continue what you were doing on the air.  Continue the joke.  So I don't say hi to anyone. 
[00:35:00]  No.  I kind of look down and walk around this joint because I just don't want to, you know, to get  in trouble with that dumb human resources.  So easy to.  I'm afraid if I repeat anything you guys say that HR is going to come down on me and  say, where did you hear that?  And then I'm going to say, well, I heard on Opie and Anthony and the next thing you  know, they're going to block Sirius XM from streaming in our office and then I can't even  listen to you guys.  So it's just ridiculous.  But good job last night.  Thank you, sir.  You're very welcome.  Watch it out, guys.  All right.  And because we're doing our radio show, I just want to say this. 
[00:35:30]  HR sucks a dick.  Yes.  Sucks a dick here.  Sucks a dick in your workplace.  I know.  It is amazing.  You know what?  Just taking all the fun out of people's jobs.  Yeah.  We used to be...  Most jobs...  It was harmless fun.  Most jobs suck.  They really do.  Yeah.  Most people don't have fun at their jobs.  I had a lot of sucky jobs before I got lucky and, you know, made something of myself with  this radio thing.  Horrible.  Most jobs suck. 
[00:36:00]  People are nodding in their cars right now.  Yeah.  And then you got HR to make it just horrendous.  Yeah.  They're going to fucking...  And they think they're making it a better work environment for everybody.  That flirting got you through a work day.  Oh, please.  And most of the women that were getting their asses pinched.  Yep.  They would agree.  Yeah.  In the end, they would agree.  In the end.  Oh, every once in a while, someone took it too far.  But because one guy takes it too far, you need a whole department.  Yep.  A whole department to keep anything from being any fun at work. 
[00:36:30]  Remember...  You went to work just to flirt.  From nine to five, all you were doing was trying to get pussy.  Just flirting.  And not even trying to get pussy.  Sometimes it was just trying to see if you could.  Right.  Like, even get close.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  And then it just...  And, you know, and maybe you weren't actually going to, like, take the pussy.  Yeah.  But it was nice to know that, whoa, hey, I got some game.  There's some pussy over there that I think I could get if I really worked at it. 
[00:37:00]  But that's okay.  We'll flirt.  Not no more.  And then you used to get those Xeroxed copies of the jokes that everyone hung up in their cubicles.  And they were, like, racist and sexist and stuff like that.  And now you can't fucking do that.  People can't even, like, hang up a flag.  You always hear about that.  Oh, she had to take the flag down from her cubicle because then this one wants to put up a Swahili flag.  So, you know what?  Instead, we'll just make it so nobody can have a flag in their cubicle or no one can have a joke or a picture of something. 
[00:37:30]  And that will be the downfall to our society is listening to these minority, not minority people, the minority.  The minority of people that are offended by this or take it too far or want some kind of action taken against somebody because they're doing something.  And it really is indicative of what this country is becoming as far as they want everyone to be the same. 
[00:38:00]  Like, everyone has to be the same.  There's nothing – no more originality, no more individuality.  When you would decorate up your cubicle with things – and I'm just using that as an example.  It could be anything.  It could be the guy at the garage with his snap-on toolbox that he'd lift up and you'd see the fucking hot chicks.  Sure.  Pin-ups in there and stuff.  A little centerfold from Playgirl in there.  Yeah, whatever.  A little bush.  Some bush.  That was individuality.  That was you personalizing your little area of the world that you had to fucking work in that day to make it just a little better. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe if you knocked your knuckles as you're fucking trying to take out that manifold bolt and it finally get let loose and bam, you whack your knuckles and you're like, motherfucker.  And you turned around and just saw a bush.  You saw that fucking nude in there.  It made you feel a little better.  It calmed you down a little bit, right?  Right.  I'm hoping there's some kind of guy out there that's going to start a business and brings it all back.  Just bring it back.  And when he's interviewing people, he goes, look, we don't believe in human resources here. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Are you okay with a little pinch to the hiney?  Because it's going to happen in my company.  You know what?  I wonder if you can do that.  You know something?  There are no lawsuits here.  Right.  You can't sue.  Right.  You can't.  But you're going to.  You're going to have to sign a contract.  You're not going to be able to sue.  Yeah.  But we're going to have a really good time.  Would you be offended if you walked into work one day and I said, do you have a license for those guns?  Right.  Because you have very big tits.  Right. 
[00:39:30]  And you can't say anything.  Right.  You can't take it to anybody.  You can't sue me.  And every day at 3 o'clock, we will put our hineys on the copy machine.  Yes.  We're all going to put our hineys on the copy machine.  Yeah.  And you have to press your tits on there.  Yeah.  And we're going to just laugh and hand them out to everybody.  Right.  Because it's just fun for everyone.  And for this, I'm even willing to pay a little more.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Like, you pay a little more, but you can't say anything.  Yeah.  And we don't do casual Fridays here.  No.  We do thong Fridays. 
[00:40:00]  We do thong Fridays.  We do teaback Fridays.  Teaback Fridays where you have to just walk around with a thong on.  Is that okay?  Would you be good with that?  I should have never been confused by what paper the Great Gazoo thing is on.  Yeah.  Is in.  I'm getting killed and I just want to acknowledge that.  Oh, no.  Booby man.  I know what paper you were reading.  Denny's.  Your placemat.  A lot of placemat jokes coming in.  It's so funny.  Can't get to all of them right now.  But the Great Gazoo, yeah, it was in Phil Mushnick's column. 
[00:40:30]  I'd like to think that, I guess maybe this one was too obvious, but there you go.  What we were talking about yesterday.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  David Wright and then right next to him, a picture of the Great Gazoo from the Flintstones.  It really is similar.  That is a big dopey looking helmet.  Take your stupid helmet off, David Wright.  He's scared.  Go up to that plate without a helmet on.  He's just scared of the ball.  Go the other way.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  All right.  So it's just, it really is one of these things of just doing away with people's individuality. 
[00:41:00]  And I don't think people realize that's what it's doing.  It's making everyone the same.  And it gets, you know, you can even take it as far as the whole political climate these days, where they want everyone to have the same health care, the same this, the same pay, the same it.  It's like, no.  It's not what this country's about.  We're all very individual in this country.  Absolutely.  And that's what made it great.  So let's stick to that.  Some people are perverts.  Some people are very smart.  Some people are extremely stupid. 
[00:41:30]  Some people are prudes.  Some people are perverts.  Let's all work together and embrace the differences.  Like you said, the pinch on the ass.  Maybe the girl doesn't like it.  Let her turn around and go, don't fucking pinch my ass.  Most girls like it, though.  Oh, they love it.  They go home going, all right.  Just start pinching the girl's asses in your workplace.  And see who likes it and who doesn't.  Let's say hi to Jason in Illinois.  Jason.  Yeah.  My wife came home with this story last night. 
[00:42:00]  She took her mom out to eat, and they had taken their, it would be my niece, granddaughter, their granddaughter.  She was in the backseat with their dog, and she's like, Grandma, your dog doesn't love me like my dog does.  And Grandma says, well, why is that?  Well, he won't lick my hoo-hoo.  What?  Turns out the dog is her dog at home.  She's five.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[00:42:30]  And she.  Yes.  She told.  Grandma had to investigate, and apparently it's been licked a little bit raw.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm not.  Wow.  So.  I had to tell somebody, and it's not like this is a story.  You can just tell somebody.  Well, by the way.  How did the kid figure that out?  I don't know.  Well, the.  Yeah, the dog figured it out.  Yeah, the dog.  Apparently, if she has her underwear on, the damn thing will like. 
[00:43:00]  No.  I understand what you guys are saying, the dog figured it out, but then the kid also figured  it out, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  I mean, dogs come a sniffing and doing their thing, but if you don't understand what that's  all about or you're not into it, guess what?  It's only going to happen one time.  And saying the dog doesn't love me like the dog at home means that, like.  She really figured it out.  She sees that as being something that's, you know.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Grandma said, well, why would you let them do that?  And she's like, because it feels good.  Oh, boy. 
[00:43:30]  That's damaged goods already.  Absolutely.  Good luck.  Thank you, Jason.  That's the phone call of the day.  By the way, we told everyone we'd bring back Line of the Day after break.  Yeah.  And I'm getting killed on Twitter.  We got to bring that back.  Not today.  We'll bring it back next week.  We'll start fresh next week.  This was just a goof week.  Yeah, yeah.  This is goof week.  It's not to be taken seriously.  We're just warming up again.  It's a goof.  Getting the rhythm back.  Let's say hi to Brian and PA. 
[00:44:00]  Brian.  Brian.  You made a great joke before about when the guy opens his toolbox, and there's a play  girl in there, and you start giggling, and Ante just spits all over it.  He didn't even acknowledge you.  Oh, I missed it.  What did I miss?  You, Ante, or Opie said the people decorating their own workspace, and the guy opens up his  toolbox, and he goes, and there's a picture from play girl in there, and Opie just started  laughing, and you started ranting about books. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, you said play girl?  Yeah.  It was a callback, but this guy brought, another guy on the phone's like, you said play girl  instead of play boy.  No, I meant to say play girl.  It was a callback.  Thank you, Brian.  I appreciate it.  I missed it.  Good joke.  Good joke.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I missed that.  Let's go to Elizabeth in New Hampshire.  Elizabeth.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say, I work in a large office space, and I have an internal window kind  of facing, you know, not external, and I tried to put up a cute little stained glass window  with a daylily in it, and I've been asked to take it down because they're concerned I 
[00:45:00]  was going to sexually harass someone if I had the door shut, because it was a little  bit opaque so you couldn't see, and so someone would feel threatened by me.  Are you shitting me?  No, I'm not kidding.  They want complete transparency so that you can't hide and sexually harass somebody?  Yes, absolutely, and in fact, anyone who has any shades or anything to try to get some  privacy so as not to see the distraction of thousands of people walking about are also  required to take those down as well, because the same reason. 
[00:45:30]  You might feel intimidated or harassed if you're sitting in the office.  Look where we've come.  Amazing.  Oh, my God, where we can't even have a little bit of privacy just to keep the distractions  away so you can do your job better.  It's really sad, and just on sort of a separate note, but also HR, I had broken my foot and  had a cast on.  When I got it off, I had to wear tennis shoes around the office for a few weeks.  I had to get a note from my doctor saying I needed to wear tennis shoes so that I wasn't 
[00:46:00]  violating their policies, so it is a little carried away.  Friday will be Hawaiian shirt day.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  There you go.  That's what we've become, Elizabeth.  Thank you.  Exactly.  Thanks, boys.  All right.  Yep.  You know, there's something to be said about being able to, you know, fuck off during work  hours.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Like when you're, I mean, look at this joint.  I mean, every office is a glass office.  Glass everywhere.  I mean, so you have to look like you're working the entire time you're in this building. 
[00:46:30]  Yep.  No one has eight hours of work.  No.  But the boss is like, if they hired you, they want you to work the entire eight hours.  Yeah.  But the reality is you don't have eight hours of work every day.  So you take a little time to check Facebook.  Yeah.  Just a little time.  Are they banning Facebook at work yet?  Not here.  No, of course not here.  That's all I ever see is people on Facebook.  Oh, really?  That's all I see.  But I would imagine that's the next thing in the regular workplace. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, there have been workplaces that have done that.  Where they're banning the Facebook websites because, you know.  There are some workplaces that have complete control over the internet in the workplace.  And, wow, they, you can't, you can't do anything on it.  They don't get it.  Can't go to certain websites.  Because that makes your employees a bit miserable.  A little angry.  Yeah, you get that chance to just, you know, check some statuses on your Facebook and whatnot. 
[00:47:30]  It helps you.  Puts a little pep in your step.  Does it?  And then you go back to work.  Well, I think the advent of the computer in the workplace has kind of stopped the other fucking around that you used to do.  Which is kind of, you know, water cooler talk.  No one talks at the water cooler.  You just, you want to get back to your computer and do whatever you're doing online.  Looking at porn, checking, doing your Facebook, whatever it is.  But I guess it used to be, that used to be the time that was spent trading those Xeroxes and pinching girls' asses. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, the old, like the old Bewitched, like where Darren used to work at Larry Tate's office.  I just picture Larry Tate and Darren just pinching ass and making tit jokes and everything.  Having sex in the supply closet.  That's exactly the type of atmosphere where they're just, yeah, give me a double.  They're drinking at the job and just talking tits.  Just talking tits and ass. 
[00:48:30]  The old 60s office.  Yeah, look, there it is.  All right, yeah, get in here.  Get on that dictaphone.  Just saying dictaphone now will get you thrown out.  You know what sucks?  Companies now have to hire ugly secretaries.  Yeah.  That job was always for the piece of ass.  Yep, the sexy secretary.  Because what does a secretary really do?  But now, because, you know, we're politically correct and this and that,  you see ugly secretaries everywhere.  Or guy secretaries. 
[00:49:00]  What's that?  Yeah, because there was always the, a lot of the sitcoms back in the 60s and stuff had the wife that would be angry when she'd go to work,  go to drop something off to the husband and meet the secretary and she was hot.  Yeah.  She'd be like, well, what's up?  Because she knew shenanigans was going on.  You guys are so insensitive.  Oh, really?  Does anybody even say secretary anymore?  It's executive assistant.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, of course.  Secretary.  You can't even call them secretaries.  That's like calling somebody a stewardess.  A sexy stew. 
[00:49:30]  I always found it funny when I was interviewing and you go to the workplace and you see that hot piece of ass that was like the boss's assistant.  You're like, okay.  Because you know the boss hired this person.  Of course.  She can't do anything.  It's so obvious.  It's just his type.  It's just his type.  He hired his type.  Yeah.  Not a good typist.  He hired his type.  And you know damn well there were plenty of other qualified women.  Of course.  That weren't his type. 
[00:50:00]  Maybe it was a brunette.  Maybe it was a flatso.  Or what not.  David Wright pushed out.  Didn't wear the helmet last night.  Okay.  There's an update from Nick on Long Island.  If Red Eye.  Getting back to the Red Eye thing, Ant.  Kevin and Philly.  If Red Eye were animated, you would have been fine.  Yeah.  It's hard to hold cartoons accountable.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Because people are voicing the cartoons.  Yeah.  And people write them and draw them and write the content.  But for some reason, the cartooniness is a buffer. 
[00:50:30]  It makes it so you can really get away with murder as far as content goes.  But not be held accountable.  Because you look silly.  If you really make a cartoon an issue.  Whether it's racial, sexual, whatever.  You look silly.  Because people will then go, come on.  It's a cartoon.  You watch.  Yeah.  That's where they go next.  I don't know.  You watch.  Because they tried with South Park when it first came out. 
[00:51:00]  The success of South Park.  The success of Family Guy.  Simpsons even early on.  The Simpsons a little bit.  Now that means more cartoons are going to go down that road.  And you watch.  It's going to be an issue.  Now when the Simpsons first came out, there was a big to-do about Bart's language.  And then that episode where Bart got a tattoo.  That was like a big deal.  And I remember the t-shirts because it would say like underachiever or something.  Yeah.  And like I guess some groups got all, you know, in a tizzy.  Because that's like the wrong message to send to kids. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, the wrong message.  Eat My Shorts was like a huge thing that they didn't want the kids saying and repeating.  You know.  So they did catch a lot of shit.  And that was.  How long has the Simpsons been on?  20 years.  20 years.  20 fucking years.  Okay.  You know, this is going to sound sacrilegious.  But I never got into The Simpsons.  I have to say.  I never really got into it.  I watched from time to time.  I even bought a box set and went and started watching.  Going, what did I miss?  Maybe I should watch this again.  I never really got into it. 
[00:52:00]  It depends what seasons you get.  Because the early ones were really more like kids shows than, you know, for adults.  And then the later seasons, like maybe the past, I guess, five or six years,  it's been nothing but, you know, celebrity guests and stuff.  I know.  But that middle chunk of The Simpsons, actually when Conan was writing for them,  that was like the golden age of The Simpsons.  That was the best thing.  Really good.  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it.  But as far as Family Guy goes, when Family Guy is on TV, even though I have every DVD,  I will watch every episode that's in front of my face that's on live TV. 
[00:52:30]  I will stop every time.  I have a box set.  Even if I've seen that episode a bunch of times.  I have a box set with like the first like five or six seasons.  I don't think I've ever put a disc in.  But every time it's on TBS, I leave it on.  If it's on Cartoon Network, I leave it on.  And at this point, it's on all the time.  Family Guy, you could pretty much find around the clock.  Yeah, they're syndicated to, I think, PIX out here in New York.  And they caught a lot of heat, too, with the fucking digital ass crack that they had to do  when they had to pixelate the ass cracks in Family Guy. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  So things do, they do kind of pick on the cartoons, but not as badly.  They don't feel like the cartoon is going to get fired.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It's like, okay, the cartoon isn't going to get fired.  Right.  But when you do something on a radio show or a TV show, you're like, I could get fired for saying this.  Of course.  And South Park, same thing.  I always loved South Park.  Even when they had a couple years there where you thought they were done,  and then they made a huge comeback. 
[00:53:30]  South Park?  Whatever now.  Hey, by the way, Ant, we're behind the times.  Facebook is being blocked all over the fucking place.  Yeah, yeah.  The instant feedback in the phones have just exploded.  Facebook is blocked not only on my work PC, but also my work BlackBerry.  Really?  Wow.  That's Phil.  Phil?  That's just stupid.  More stupidity.  Yeah.  That's why I can't deal with anyone that wears a tie.  They're just dumb thinkers.  Yeah.  Know what I would do? 
[00:54:00]  They think it cuts down on productivity.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, but it also, you know, drops morale.  Yeah.  People love their Facebook.  We're living in an era where people want to check their Facebook almost every hour at  this point, okay?  What you do, if you're a cool boss, remember the cool teacher that brings you outside?  Remember there was only one, and the rest of them were stuffy assholes?  Of course.  But one guy would go, you know what?  It's fucking 85 degrees in January.  We're going outside today.  Yay.  And we're going to sit around a dumb apple tree, and we're going to learn maybe for 10 
[00:54:30]  minutes, and the rest of the hour, we're just going to enjoy the nice day.  Mm-hmm.  I love those guys.  It brought morale up.  And guess what?  You studied a little harder for that class.  There was some kind of appreciation.  What I would do as a boss, it's really simple.  You don't ban Facebook.  Maybe there's a way where you pay attention to how long they're on Facebook, and maybe  it makes some kind of weird limit where I'll give you two hours a week or whatever it would  be, whatever makes sense. 
[00:55:00]  And maybe they could, because they're checking our email.  They're checking everything we do as soon as we walk into the workplace now.  Look at all the cameras around here.  I know.  They know you're every step.  So they're already checking your shit.  So they can put some kind of program in place where they go, all right, we will allow you  to check your Facebook for a certain amount of time per week.  And that's it.  And then you're conscious of that, so you're checking quickly.  Keeps your morale up, and then you're doing your job for the asshole.  They just see it as loss of productivity.  That's what they see.  They don't look at morale or anything. 
[00:55:30]  It's like a Sims game, though.  If you look at it, it's like a Sims game.  If you take certain things away, people will have the grumpy thing over their head, and  then they don't do as much work.  They're just hiring robots at this point.  Robots.  You know that little chit-chat in the hallway?  You know, that kind of made you get through your day.  Made you kind of, like you said, kept your morale up.  But now you're paranoid to do a little chit-chat in the hall.  Oh, no, just stay in your cubicle and make believe you're working for eight straight hours.  Not only that, you're afraid to talk because what you say might be deemed inappropriate. 
[00:56:00]  Or, yeah, a boss might see you talking and say, why aren't you working?  It's just become, yeah, get in, sit down, do your fucking job, or make it look like you're  doing your job.  Who didn't take a two-hour lunch?  Oh, please.  Because you could.  You can't anymore.  They're clocking you as soon as you come back in.  They got all these electronic gadgets.  I hate this thing, by the way.  Oh, the little cards.  It drives me fucking nuts.  The beepy cards for every door?  Every time I go through a door in this facility.  The beepy cards for the beepy doors. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know, man.  I think life has just passed me by.  Yeah.  I can't handle this stuff.  For real.  I don't like all this tech.  What does it take to get into the studio?  Think about it.  Yeah.  We have to go through two security guys.  We have to go through the, I'm going into a ball game turnstile.  Turnstile.  And you got to use your beepy card.  And then I have to use this card twice.  Yeah.  Just to get in. 
[00:57:00]  Pass the guard and then hit the other thing.  And then as soon as I get in, then I'm on camera the whole time.  The whole time.  Everywhere you walk, you're on camera.  We really have entered a weird time.  What does it all mean?  You can't get away with shit anymore.  Prove that this is making people work harder.  Prove it to me.  When I worked at True Mechanical, another air conditioning company before Apollo.  The famous Apollo.  Yes.  I worked at True Mechanical and there was a bar next door. 
[00:57:30]  And the whole shop, I used to, I worked in the shop, you know, and the shop foreman and  all the workers every fucking day would go to the bar next door and drink and play the  horses at the OTB that was next door to the bar for about an hour and a half and then walk  back to work with a little, you know, little booze in us and get on immense pieces of moving  machinery and handle a sheet metal. 
[00:58:00]  How many injuries?  And bend it.  For real.  Every so often you'd cut yourself or you'd bang yourself with a machine or something like that.  But no missing fingers or anything.  But the thing is, the boss kind of knew what we were doing, but just left it alone.  Right.  Now, you know, you'd be punching out cameras here, security doors, locks.  They wouldn't let you do that.  Liability, this, that.  They should, they should go, they should deal with just percentages. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  If one guy lost his arm because he was a little drunk when he went back to on the job.  Depends on how many people work there.  You chalk it up to, well, we're going to lose an arm every once in a while, but look  at all the fun we've had.  If you only have two people working there and one person loses the arm.  Maybe a problem.  Could be a problem.  Right.  But every time there's some kind of tragedy, then everything has to change.  This Hudson River thing is a joke.  I know.  They've been flying over the Hudson River.  Helicopters, jumbo jets, private planes, all sorts of shit, right? 
[00:59:00]  For years and years and years and years, no problems.  The Sully thing, that's, you know, that's one of those.  A fluke.  That was a fluke.  There was an unfortunate, as we know by now, helicopter and plane crash over the Hudson.  Now all the rules have to change.  Everything changes now.  They don't even acknowledge all the years where nothing happened.  Whatsoever.  Nothing happened.  You get that many things buzzing around the sky.  Occasionally, they're going to bounce into each other.  You get this dumb, I think Chuck Schumer had to jump on this one.  Of course he did. 
[00:59:30]  You know, oh, we got to make the airspace safe.  It was safe.  It was an unfortunate incident that happened.  Horse out of the barn, Schumer.  After the fact, he jumps on everything.  So now there's all sorts of new rules in place for the Hudson River if you're flying over that.  Like you have to put in a flight plan now.  You can't fly around.  Because people used to just be able, on a clear day, you can see forever.  On a clear day, you used to be able to just take off from like Republic Airport in a light plane. 
[01:00:00]  You'd have to tell the traffic controllers where you're going and what you're doing.  But you could do a couple of laps around the city.  Whatever.  Now, you don't file a flight plan.  Be here.  Stick to an altitude.  Do this.  Do this.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It used to be visual.  You would just kind of look around and go, okay, I can see what's going on.  I'll just look.  And the odds of two things in the air crashing.  I know.  Think about that one.  And by the way, there will never be flying cars because of that. 
[01:00:30]  Of course.  Like people think it's going to be just flying around in flying cars.  No.  It never happened.  Wow.  God, where do you go?  Phones lit.  Instant feedback lit.  I had a 42-minute lunch at a greeting card company.  What?  Oh, let's say hi to Tony in Cleveland.  Tony.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, boys.  How are you doing today?  All right, man.  Yeah, I worked at American Greetings Card Company.  My lunch was from 1218 to 1 o'clock.  So I started getting ready at 1215. 
[01:01:00]  They look at you like you're going to take their kid or something.  1218.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  1218 to 1.  I don't know, man.  It was so bad.  I had to get out of there.  It's brutal.  Brutal there.  That's nothing but trying to put one over on you.  Yep.  It's like a dominating thing.  Yep.  They want to dominate you.  We're talking to a lot of bosses right now.  Yeah.  Lighten up.  You suck.  Be the cool boss.  Can't be the cool boss.  Don't be jumping down one of your employees' throats if he's 10 minutes late from lunch or 
[01:01:30]  something.  Maybe every day.  They say, you know what the bosses would say?  Well, you give him an inch, they take a mile.  Yeah.  Brr, brr, brr.  Give him a hand, they take the whole arm.  Really?  Cody in Indiana.  There was a restaurant that we used to go to when we were younger, and there were always  a bunch of hot waitresses there.  And we'd always say, hey, Bill, what do you hire these girls based on?  And he goes, the lap test. 
[01:02:00]  What is the lap test?  Well, I don't know, but that restaurant's out of business.  Later, boys.  All right.  The lap test.  Sounds good.  Remember the dog story with the niece?  Oh, yeah.  We missed a good line.  Max in Fairfield.  What's up, Max?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, that guy with the five-year-old should really check the grandfather's closet to make  sure there isn't a dog suit hanging in there.  Oh, shit.  Goodbye.  With the Cooley hole cut out. 
[01:02:30]  Let's see how to Stryker.  Not the Stryker that will be co-hosting with Sam and E-Rock.  Unfortunately, not.  The big wrestling weekend is almost here.  Oh, we got in trouble?  You got in trouble?  For what?  How do you get in trouble?  Because we're just...  We're going to have to figure this out.  Are you serious?  I want to hear all the details.  Oh, we'll hear during the break.  Okay.  How do you get in trouble?  Because we're goofing on something.  Like, Danny's freaking out right now.  He's doing the safe.  He's doing...  He looks like an oomph going, safe! 
[01:03:00]  Please tell me they came to you and said, you should be the one that controls these guys.  Because we've heard that over the years.  Are you shitting me?  Uh-huh.  Dude.  Once again...  What?  We started the show by talking about jokes and sarcasm.  My God, man.  Let me go on record and tell everybody I love the WWE and what they've done for us over the years.  Look, dummies!  Here's the deal.  We have been in a relationship with WWE when they were WWF.  Okay?  We know them. 
[01:03:30]  We adore working with them.  They know our sense of humor.  That's why they fucking advertise with us.  That's why they send people over here.  They know us.  They love when we talk about them, no matter if it's good or bad or funny or fucking whatever.  They loved us so much that Vince McMahon personally hired us for that horse shit, the XFL.  What a piece of dog shit that was.  But he personally called us and said, I'm doing this XFL thing and I need you boys.  Then he said, yeah, fine.  Yeah, we know that you're a fired thing, personally. 
[01:04:00]  We certainly do.  We fucking...  And we know that they can take the joke.  Holy shit.  Come on!  Lighten the fuck up!  So, I'm going on record.  Yeah, we love the WWE and the WWF.  Yeah.  We wouldn't have their horse shit wrestlers on our show if we didn't like them.  Their horse shit wrestlers!  Oh my God.  You know how many people we don't have on our show because we don't like them?  We don't respect them. 
[01:04:30]  We don't get it.  I want to know.  You never hear about those people because guess what?  We just say no, no, no, no.  The people we say yes to for our show, that means we are interested in them and we think  they'll do good radio.  And it's the...  Let me make something clear here also.  How many times have we been approached by sales with a product that they've said, is there  a way you can incorporate this into just you and the show?  Right.  Like, to make it not sound like a commercial, but to like, just incorporate it into your show 
[01:05:00]  naturally.  Right.  And it's some product.  There's no fucking way we'd ever be able to do that.  Right.  That's what we've been doing with the WWE.  We talk about it in a way.  And I want to know something, Danny.  I want to know something.  Did the WWE contact the Sirius and say, shut those guys up.  They're saying things about the product.  Or was it someone from sales that went, or was it management that said, we don't want 
[01:05:30]  you talking like that about that.  Because if it's WWE, then fine.  Then we got to shut up.  That's the sponsor.  We should shut up.  Danny will talk during the break.  But...  He's scared.  They scared him.  If it's somebody from here that got no word from WWE...  They got to him.  See if Danny...  Then they should just shut the fuck up and let us talk about him.  They got to Danny.  See if he has a scar on his head.  WWE loves when we talk about them.  They don't care if it's fucking goofing on them.  That's what they goof on themselves. 
[01:06:00]  Look at Vince.  He's a complete ass.  Please be quiet.  It's Friday.  I want to get a hold of my time.  I'm just reading that.  Listen.  What are you doing later, man?  Drinking a lot.  All right.  But I will...  Come on over.  I will guarantee you this.  And this is why I got to run a company someday.  Someday.  I guarantee all that negative talk we did about what we're doing this weekend on 202.  Yes.  And goofing on Sam and goofing on the WWE and all that and whatnot.  And Striker. 
[01:06:30]  More people know about what they're promoting.  The classic wrestling thing.  And more people will be checking out the wrestling program.  Yes.  That is happening this weekend on our channel.  I guarantee that.  I know that's hard to wrap your mind around.  But we brought so much attention to it that more people know about it.  That shit works.  Trust me.  We have incorporated it organically, as they like to say, into our program. 
[01:07:00]  What's it called?  It's called...  It's called...  Yeah.  It's got a word.  It's got some stupid sales word.  Integration.  Synergy.  Synergy and integration.  Yes.  Synergy sucks a dick.  We have integrated it into the program organically in a way that people just think we're talking.  Well, well, well, well.  After we let it bake for a while and then we blue-skied it.  Yes.  Blue-skied it.  All these corporate terms that mean nothing.  Do you understand how that works?  See, I'm cool.  We're doing exactly what you want us to do with a product. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Holy mother of fuck.  I'm a cool corporate guy.  I come up with stuff like, let it bake and let's blue-skied that.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Liquid-ass rules.  Liquid-ass rules?  I love Guinness.  Yep.  I hear there might be something going on with Guinness.  What?  With us?  With me.  Oh, with a life in the compound?  Could be a little tasting of...  A little payola action?  Nice. 
[01:08:00]  No.  I've been doing that plug-old payola for a long time.  It's about time you get involved.  It's...  I want to be able...  I want to be able to talk about the product.  So, we might be able to taste some of this 250-year anniversary Guinness.  This shit...  Mmm.  I've been getting shit for free for years, my friend.  Just by talking about it, it's awesome.  You can't say that.  Oh, you haven't.  Awesome.  Now I'm stepping in.  Awesome.  I'm...  Where's my tie?  I have to stop you.  You should see my furnished apartment. 
[01:08:30]  I haven't paid for shit.  All right.  Hold on.  I haven't paid for shit.  Just make believe you like a certain product, and man, the UPS man comes a-calling.  Hey, you know who has great furniture?  Crate and Barrel.  Hey, um, look.  What?  You see what I'm holding up?  You see my brand new car?  You think I paid for that?  Yeah, right.  Red flag.  Are you kidding me?  Red flag.  I haven't paid for shit.  Oh, Jesus, please.  No, God.  Help me.  See, that's called sarcasm.  That's the theme of today's show. 
[01:09:00]  Exactly.  Sarcasm and jokes.  God.  God, I can't believe they don't cut that.  I can't wait to hear who fucking brought this up.  Now, was it WWE or management?  It was not WWE, right?  See, Travis is shaking his head no.  WWE would be the only-  It was fucking management, and Danny didn't say it.  There's another person giving me some sign language.  Yeah.  And now that person disappeared, so no one else could see who just did that.  So now it's just me and the person that helped me out. 
[01:09:30]  If it was WWE, we would then stop.  All right, listen.  And that's why when 10.30 hits, we take a quick left, a quick right, a quick jog down  the hall, another right, elevator's waiting for us, we're out of here.  We look like when the Roadrunner is coming down the street.  You don't get it.  That's what it looks like when we leave.  Like the Roadrunner.  Plus, you know what?  I'll tell you this much.  The WWE owes us a few things.  You're damn straight, they do.  You know how much free advertising we've given these guys over the years?  Hell yes. 
[01:10:00]  We've talked to those fucking dolts for years.  It was management.  And let it be known, it was not Danny.  Uh-huh.  Who's usually the troublemaker.  No.  Fucking Mars.  That's who it was.  Mars is the rat.  Mars is the rat.  Wait to hear Mars' promo.  Oh, I can't wait to hear this.  Yeah, we got some goods.  Where's Sam today?  Maybe we can play this going into break.  Because I see Mars.  Hello, Sam.  There's Samuel. 
[01:10:30]  What's up, Sam?  Not too much.  By the way, Sam, I got very good news for you.  What's that?  42 days until Fur Fright 2000.  Fur Fright.  And how many blue fucking dragon pictures did you get yesterday?  A lot of blue dragon pictures, actually.  A huge amount.  You know, years spreading it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Cooley Hole?  Yeah.  I said Cooley Hole earlier, and it reminded me of what we were discussing over the past week. 
[01:11:00]  Uh, Jimmy James, Sam.  Oh, it doesn't have to come.  Yeah, it's the same guy.  He works in construction, and he's trying to tell me that, we got to go to this call.  Hold on, Sam, because I want to get into what Mars did.  Uh, that they're tracking, he works a construction job, and they're tracking him.  How are they tracking construction workers?  I've heard, this started happening after I got out of construction.  And I thought that was the last cool job where you could get away with murder.  Nope.  I used to have a truck, uh, remember I used to take my Apollo van everywhere.  Right.  And I had a thing on the back that said, how am I driving, or, uh, and then I would have 
[01:11:30]  a number that you would call, and I changed the number with electrical tape, so I'd be  able to drive around like an ass, and no one would know, uh, the better.  That's brilliant.  The GPS is on every one of these fucking vehicles.  They know where you are.  They used to, it used to be this.  This is what I used to get.  Uh, base to 16, base to 16.  Uh, 16 to base, what's up?  Uh, yeah, what's your location?  Oh, yeah, I'm still, uh, uh, I'm just, uh, pulling up to the job site.  I'll, uh, be, uh, I'll call you later. 
[01:12:00]  Okay.  And then it'd be like, I'm nowhere near the job site.  You're at a boat ramp.  I'm at a fucking, yeah.  You're at a boat ramp.  I'm at a boat ramp, I'm at a tit bar, I'm somewhere, uh, and what did it matter if you  got the job done?  Yeah, the job was done, by the way.  At the end of the day, you got the job done, and if you didn't get the job done, if you  weren't able to figure out how to go to the, uh, you know, the titty bars, and go to the  liquid happy hours, or the liquid lunches, and, uh, and check your Facebook, and pinch  the ass of the hot chick at work, as long as you, you had to juggle all that stuff, and 
[01:12:30]  also get your job done, because guess what?  If you didn't get your job done at, by, at the end of the day, you were gone.  Yeah, you're gonna get fired.  So what does it matter?  If you're able to juggle checking Facebook and all this other shit, then the boss should  just leave you alone.  Here's something you'd never hear.  Uh, 16 to base.  Uh, base.  Go ahead, 16.  Yeah, I finished the job.  Can you send me to another one?  It just wasn't gonna happen.  Right.  And if I had nowhere to go, I would just stretch the one job they gave me out to, like, finish 
[01:13:00]  the day.  Of course.  But if I could finish the job by noon, and get the fuck out of there, that's what I'm  doing.  Of course.  Jimmy, what are they doing in the construction world?  Hey, boys.  Hey, just one quick thing on the WWE, too.  Isn't this the same company that had on live television an 80-year-old woman give birth  to a hand?  Right.  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I think they might get, like, jokes and edgy shit.  Yeah.  They don't take themselves too seriously.  And if they don't, I don't, we don't need them. 
[01:13:30]  Vince's ass got buffed.  Right.  On television.  I don't think they really take themselves all that seriously.  Uh, what do you got?  Well, uh, they, like Ant was saying, every vehicle now has GPS, and, uh, they know if  you actually, during your, you know, a break, you go in and just turn the key,  to listen to the radio while you're eating, they know, they know how long you're listening.  You know, they can track you there.  If you're driving to the job, and you exceed, you know, 75 miles an hour, phone rings, you're 
[01:14:00]  going too fast.  And they know if you're driving off hours.  Yeah, it doesn't stop in the office.  That's, I actually left an office job, you know, in the, in the tech industry to go to  construction, because I couldn't stand being in high school again with the office politics.  And it just follows you.  The world's gone.  Dude, you can't even drive your, your, your company truck, like, after hours?  You know, you take it out every so often? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, which would be free advertising for them, if you think about it.  Yeah, it's doing them a favor.  It's doing them a favor, drinking and driving their vehicle.  I think, I think people listening to us around our age, we, we have seen a drastic change.  Like the, like the, the, the kids calling the kids coming up now and going to work for  the first time.  They don't know any better.  So I guess they'll just accept it, which is scary to think.  Yeah.  We've seen some unbelievable changes in the workplace.  You used to be able to get away with a lot more. 
[01:15:00]  And by the way, all that shit we're not allowed to do anymore at the workplace, I guarantee  the bosses are still doing all that stuff.  Yeah.  I guarantee their computers are still able to check their Facebook pages.  I guarantee it.  Well, and what you said about the kids coming up, yeah, they don't, they don't know any  better.  I remember, you know, you've got to, you get a new helper and you got to, you got to treat  them nice.  Oh God.  I remember when I came in and if I did something wrong, I cut a piece of pipe wrong.  I had 10 foot six, a pipe coming flying back at my head from the top of a 12 foot ladder. 
[01:15:30]  God damn, he's right.  And I just grabbed it and walked back and I'll do that again.  I don't know how many times I was called like a fucking retard.  It's like, what are you a fucking retard?  What did you do?  Oh, you can't do that anymore.  It's like, no, I was, I was trying to do, get the fuck out of here.  Let me do this.  Get out of here.  Go back to the truck and fucking, yeah, go back to the truck, put some fucking gas in  the generator, you dummy.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Oh, and then when I started getting helpers, when I got to the point where I had to get 
[01:16:00]  helpers and pick them up at the fucking park and ride and go to a job, it was like another  fucking dummy.  I used to go to him, I go, why don't you just go to sleep?  Go to sleep somewhere and I'll do this because you're just fucking everything up.  Now they would go to HR and you'd be reprimanded or fired.  How great was it to figure out your nap spot?  Fantastic.  Holy shit, was that great.  I used to find little nooks and crannies.  Oh my God.  There's a place, it's called the Omni building in Oak, Oak, not Oakdale, Uniondale. 
[01:16:30]  Okay.  It's a big brown fucking building.  I, there were nooks and crannies in the basement of that building that I slept for hours, hours.  And I'd have the pager, uh, like under my head, under my hand and my hand on my, uh, my head  on my hand.  So when the pager would buzz, my head would buzz and it would wake me up.  It was like an alarm clock and a boss is coming alarm clock.  But the point is you got your job done. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  At the end of the day, you got your job done.  I just had to sleep something off at the beginning of the day.  I hear you.  You know, don't worry about it.  Construction company and people calling over, all right, whatever, uh, firemen.  All right.  And then a teacher.  And then we, uh, and then I think we take a break.  We'll do the Mars thing.  I want to hear.  We've gone an hour and a half here.  Cody, what's up?  Hey guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey man.  Uh, we, uh, got a little memo the other day from human resources.  Now I'm a fireman in Houston.  They don't want us bunkering out anymore in the truck because it's dangerous. 
[01:17:30]  They want us to wait till we get to the fire, then bunker up.  It's not going to fire.  Why is it dangerous to be bunkered up in the truck?  We're fighting fire.  What the fuck is dangerous in the beginning?  I don't know.  You're going into a fire.  What is the term bunker up?  All the gear on?  Yeah.  All the gear on.  Yeah.  We can't even put our gear on until we get to the fire.  It's going to look good when the family's sitting outside and we're putting our shit on.  Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  But what, I don't understand why that's a bad thing. 
[01:18:00]  Because.  No, I mean, why can't you bunker up before you get to a fire?  I don't understand that.  Why is it dangerous?  There's so many wrecks and when you're trying to put your pack on and stuff, you don't have  your seatbelt on and there's a wreck, you know, you don't get hurt.  Oh, gotcha.  You can't, you can't like buckle up.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, but.  And on that GPS shit, yeah, there's an automatic deal on the ambulance that we have.  And if we go 85 miles an hour over, I mean, like 85 miles an hour, it sends a text or something 
[01:18:30]  to our supervisor.  So as soon as we go over, we're getting a text while we're driving saying you need to slow  down.  You know what happens if you, you know what happens if you do 88 miles an hour, my friend?  Enough said.  Enough said.  Yes.  Yeah, that's ridiculous, man.  Make that so.  Yes, he's like, yeah, that's ridiculous.  Stay away from that.  Back to the future shit, please.  Oh, look, it's on Danny's shirt.  Oh, please, no.  Oh, for the love of God, no.  We've been very good lately.  Let me say hi to, I think it's Rick, Nova Scotia. 
[01:19:00]  He's a teacher.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  Whoa.  It's Friday, and you guys got to get your blood pressure down.  I know, my, trust right.  What the fuck?  Nova Scotia.  Yeah, what do you got, Rick?  Yeah, teachers and instructors, they're not allowed to use the term rule of thumb in instruction  or any application whatsoever.  Why?  Because one kid doesn't have a thumb in class?  No, because of what it was referred to, where it came from. 
[01:19:30]  Where did the term rule of thumb come from?  Anthony knows a little something about everything.  I guarantee, yeah, you don't know.  And I guarantee most people listening don't know where that term comes from.  It was the measurement you used to use the thickness of your thumb to measure the size  of the stick you could discipline your wife with.  If it was thicker than your thumb, it was abuse.  Is that really where that came from? 
[01:20:00]  That's where it came from.  Are you kidding me?  Okay, okay.  And because of political correctness, you can't use it.  Wow.  I got retard thumbs, man.  My wife would be in trouble if this was old school.  Here it is.  It is often claimed that the term originally referred to a law that limited the maximum  thickness of a stick with which it was permissible for a man to beat his wife.  But this has been discredited, sir. 
[01:20:30]  Well, do they have the...  It's the suit saying that it can't be used because it's offensive.  All right.  There you go.  Have a good weekend, boys.  Thank you, Rick.  There goes Rick.  All right.  The phones.  We'll go back to you guys after the break.  Yeah.  Hang in there.  What do we got today?  Patrice O'Neal in about an hour.  Patrickey coming in?  Patrickey's coming in.  Nice.  We got Kurt Angle crying. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Speaking of wrestling.  For real?  Not a wrestling angle?  No.  Not a work?  No.  It's really good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He was stalking his wife?  No.  He was accused of stalking...  Remember when he was in here and we asked him about the black girl from TNA that he was  dating?  How could we forget?  He was accused of stalking her.  Uh-oh.  And he...  I thought he was his ex-wife or something.  Wasn't he a little...  No, he had a whole other story with his ex-wife.  Wasn't he a little off last time he was in?  Do you remember him being a little...  His pupils were so small. 
[01:21:30]  A little strange when he was in.  He swears he's not doing anything.  Yeah.  He was a little weird.  And to this day, I wish we'd called him out a little more.  But, I mean...  He's been a friend for years.  Jesus Christ.  We all were, like, uncomfortable as he was saying that, you know, nothing's going on  with him.  You just know.  He did scold me when I said steroids were bad.  And he said, no, only if you misuse them.  Right.  No.  A possible origin of the phrase, rule of thumb, comes from measurement, particularly in agricultural 
[01:22:00]  fields.  The plants need a fairly precise depth to seed properly, whether planted from seed or being  replanted.  But the depth can be sometimes estimated using the thumb.  That is a rule measurement of thumb.  That's probably...  The rule of thumb.  That's probably more accurate, right?  I don't know.  I think it's how far you can shove it up your ass.  No, no.  Forget it.  Up your ass.  I'm not even going to try.  I stopped.  I stopped short. 
[01:22:30]  I tried to make a dirty joke, and it failed miserably.  Rule of thumb, stop the joke.  With that, we go to break.  Oh, God, yes. 
[01:23:00]  Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Where's our Friday guy?  We didn't even take a break during that break.  No, we did more radio.  For ourselves.  No kidding.  Goddamn.  Should have taped that.  Holy shit.  Just talking about people from the past.  It was very funny.  What are we doing here?  What are we doing here?  I don't know. 
[01:23:30]  We were going to play something that Mars was involved in.  We got the Battle of the Wow promos.  Wow.  What happened here?  We love the Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  We're trying to bring that back somehow, someway.  We're starting to get the new bumper stickers out there.  I don't know how you get them, so don't ask me.  I've been seeing some stickers out there.  Yeah, I've seen a bunch lately.  On the highways and byways, as I call them.  Yep.  You got to send us a self-addressed stamped envelope.  The address will be in these promos.  Oh, okay, good.  The thing is, Intern Evan has started to develop a reputation for wasting time all the time. 
[01:24:00]  He consistently does work that's already been done.  Is that Swivel Hips?  Yes.  Yeah.  Swivel Hips.  A while ago...  See?  By the way, you know, we're good bosses.  We let them just fuck around.  Yeah.  We don't give a shit.  It's beautiful.  And his production is way up.  A while...  Yeah.  A while ago, Derek made a Christian Bale remix.  Right.  And then you played another one that said,  Oh, Intern Evan took a stab at this.  And then you went to commercial break, but made a face because you realized this is the 
[01:24:30]  same thing that Derek just did.  Right.  Which is what I told him, but then he did it anyway.  Evan has a reputation...  He has ideas that other people have, and then he does them anyway.  So we get two of everything with Evan.  I could.  So...  Now, he wrote a wow promo because we were running one, like, twice a day with me doing  some voice I made up that I couldn't take hearing anymore.  So I said...  Is it the one you're using now?  Because I feel the same way.  No!  No kidding. 
[01:25:00]  This isn't a character voice.  Oh.  Well, I can't take hearing it.  Well.  Tough.  Oh.  Are you killing yourself for the show?  No.  Yeah, when is that happening?  No.  Why?  Is that today?  Can I be nice and buried before we get back on Tuesday?  No, I'm not doing that.  All clean.  Nice.  Get the publicity.  We get you buried.  It would be good.  I'm going to make it to 26.  I'm 25 now.  Oh, okay.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Are you 25?  I'll be 26 on Sunday.  How embarrassing is it to be 25 and just look like you're 16? 
[01:25:30]  I mean, I don't...  Do you just...  You don't drink at all?  No.  Is it because you're embarrassed that you just get proofed everywhere?  No.  No, it's not.  That's not the reason.  Yeah.  Drinking would help you.  Why?  You got to age a little bit.  Gruff you up a little bit.  Yeah, you got to age a little bit.  Yeah.  No, youth is a blessing.  I'd like to keep this as long as I can.  And you're 25?  Yeah.  I got underwear that's older than you.  Oh.  Oh, B. 
[01:26:00]  You didn't say that.  Oh!  Yeah.  But yeah, so I said we needed a new wow promo immediately.  So Evan said, all right, I'm over-dramatizing as Evan does.  He said he's on it.  And he wrote a wow promo.  And Steve said, okay, fine.  This is good.  And then Evan said, okay, I'll produce it.  And Steve said, no, we'll have Lil' Nicky produce it.  Because, you know, all personal issues aside, Lil' Nicky is obviously a better production 
[01:26:30]  guy than our intern, Swivel Hips Evan.  I would hope so.  Yes.  And quicker and all that stuff.  Mm-hmm.  So, of course, Lil' Nicky produced it.  And it was, you know, fine.  It was completely broadcast quality, whatever.  Mm-hmm.  Then Evan decided to do another one anyway.  Wait, did he write the Lil' Nicky version?  He wrote it.  It's his writing.  All right, so he wrote a wow promo.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then Steve said, no, have Lil' Nicky.  Lil' Nicky produced it.  And then Evan, because he's like a true artist, is like, no, man.  Yeah, he couldn't just.  This isn't my vision, man.  Yeah, right, right, right. 
[01:27:00]  So he had to do another one?  He couldn't just take the writing credit.  And this is real?  He needed.  Yes, it's the same promo.  Okay, so here's the one that Evan wrote that Lil' Nicky produced.  He wanted to Tarantino the whole thing.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, okay.  So this is the one he wrote, but had Lil' Nicky produced.  Right.  I hate driving to work every day.  It sure would be nice if I saw a nice pair of breasts to break up the monotony.  Whoa, watch out!  You're going to die anyway, so you might as well see some tits before you go.  Get your wow stickers today. 
[01:27:30]  Just send a number 10 self-addressed dev envelope to Sirius XM Satellite Radio, the Opie and Anthony show.  Attention wow stickers, 1221 6th Avenue, 36th floor, New York, New York, 10020.  And try to make the best of your otherwise worthless and trite existence.  All right, in all fairness, I have heard that on the channel.  And it's an okay promo.  It's perfectly fine.  And Evan wrote that.  He wrote it.  That's very good.  It's produced.  So it should have stopped there.  Sound effect.  You got some of his work on the channel.  You could pat Evan on the back for saying good job writing that promo. 
[01:28:00]  Sure.  But no, it's not enough.  Was that Lil' Nicky acting?  That was Lil' Nicky in the beginning.  He's a production guy.  That is true.  So I'm just saying, Co-Fucking-Cain is a wow sticker promo.  Co-Fucking-Cain.  Yeah, that is produced right.  Co-Fucking-Cain-ish.  No, he's saying that the Co-Cain one is technically a wow sticker promo.  Yeah.  So we could just run that instead.  But what I'm saying is, once again, as was pointed out by Danny, all of Lil' Nicky's production is that extreme. 
[01:28:30]  Co-Fucking-Cain.  In fairness, this is Evan's writing.  This is Evan's writing.  But it's his writing.  But the production itself is very Co-Fucking-Cain-ish.  Yes, that's true.  So Evan decided, even though Steve told him, no, Lil' Nicky's doing this.  And I said, no, Steve said Lil' Nicky's doing this.  And it's almost done.  Yeah.  That he had to do it anyway. 
[01:29:00]  So he went to Lil' Nicky to try to get Steve's dry vocal stuff, you know, because he needed an announcer.  Uh-huh.  And he said, no, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, I already did this.  Yes.  It's kind of insulting if you're a production guy.  Right.  And so not only...  Basically saying, look, I don't like your version, so can I have the work part so I can make my version?  Yeah.  And he said, no, get your own vocal trash.  Which he should have said.  Right.  And Steve, and he went to Steve and said, will you recut this for me?  And Steve said, no, it's done.  I'm not doing it again.  I've got too much other things to do.  What those things are, none of us know, but he has things to do.  Right, of course.  He went to Danny, and Danny said, no, I'm not going to do anything for you, Evan. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  I informed him I was a character voice.  I wouldn't be doing any announcer voice.  Yes.  So there is one person left to do Evan's voiceover announcement.  This is not a bit.  No, he wasn't like, oh, I'm going to make this funny.  He was like, all right.  No, I really need to redo this.  So who did he get?  Mars.  Marcelino, the engineer.  Mars is horrible on the air.  He's terrible.  He's right behind you. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, he is.  He's so bad.  Anytime Mars has been on the air, it has sucked.  It's been a nightmare.  Even if it's something as small as just asking an extreme fighter a question, he trips over  himself.  He mispronounces words.  Didn't he ask if Fedor was a little bit?  He asked if Fedor was like a power bomb or something.  It just made everybody whine.  Oh, do we have a little example?  Yeah.  Mars, no questions?  No.  Mars, what's wrong?  Mars is scared.  You'll hang up, and he'll have 50 things he wanted to ask you. 
[01:30:30]  I was very excited that we were having you on the show today, Dana.  Actually, I was talking to a friend of mine about Fedor.  A friend, right?  Yeah.  And I said how menacing he looked to me because he was so cool and calm.  And the other individual swore to God that he was a power bottom.  Okay.  Dana?  Dana, that was the last appearance you'll ever hear of Mars, our engineer. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  We're back live from that clip.  Mars.  Wow, that was bad, Mars.  Gotta admit.  What you have to understand about Mars is his dream is to leave the world of engineering  and be an on-air guy.  He wants to be an on-air guy.  Some dreams don't come true, Mars.  You just gotta deal with it.  Don't quit your day job.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:31:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah!  Ah!  Ah!  I wrote this bit last night.  It's working well today.  I got two more.  Ah!  All right.  So Evan produced the thing with Mars.  Yeah.  He said his was better because there was a twist in the original writing.  Oh.  So there's an extra element in his that Little Niki decided not to do.  Okay.  Wow.  This is like a DVD extra.  Yeah.  That we're getting to...  This is the director's cut of that promo. 
[01:32:00]  The director's cut.  This is how the director envisioned it.  All right.  All right.  I hate driving to work every day.  Hey.  Wait, who's that?  That's Evan.  Evan is now the guy who hates to drive to work every day.  Evan is the actor and Mars is the announcer.  Okay, gotcha.  I hate driving to work every day.  Hey.  What a terrible tragedy.  The whole situation could have been avoided if he only knew about wow stickers.  I hate driving to work every day.  Hey, baby.  Oh, wow.  Those are some lovely. 
[01:32:30]  You're going to die anyway, so you might as well see some tits before you go.  Get your wow stickers today.  Just send a self-addressed stomp envelope to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Attention, wow stickers.  1221 6th Avenue, 36th floor, New York, New York, 10020.  And try to make the best of your otherwise worthless and trite existence.  What's a stomp?  A stomp.  It's so bad.  Oh, shit.  Oh, god damn. 
[01:33:00]  Is that how you say stamp?  For real?  No, stamped.  I just mispronounced that word.  We kept it.  Self-addressed stomped.  Stomped.  Wow.  So this is Mars' latest attempt.  And by the way, that is produced horribly.  Yeah, and the writing is terrible.  Everything is rushed.  You don't know.  Yeah, and just the, whatever he was using on your voice there, Mars.  Wow.  I mean, actually, just using a microphone on it was bad. 
[01:33:30]  But the effect that was on it, huh.  Little Nicky's was much better.  Yeah, you got it.  I mean, you know, personal things aside.  Yeah, personal things aside.  He's a paid production guy.  Supposed to be good.  Yeah.  All right, there you go.  Very nice.  What do we got on Kurt Angle while you're in this studio there, Sam?  Well, you're the wrestling guy.  That's correct.  He's an old friend of the show.  Last time he was in, we noticed he's a bit different from the last time he was in, prior  to that.  Been in the business for several years now, and, you know, wear and tear. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Tends to.  But now he's kind of stalking broads?  Well, the thing is, he was dating this, one of the TNA woman wrestlers for a while.  No.  Rock-a-Con.  Rock-a-Con.  Rock-a-Con?  Yeah.  Do they play Chaka-Con?  No.  They can't, you know, what, are they going to pay for rights for Rock-a-Con?  No.  But is Rock-a-Con a lot like Chaka-Con?  She's like an Amazonian.  No, I mean, she's, no, she was just like, whatever.  No, it's okay.  But, yeah, so he was dating her after he divorced his wife, and then all of a sudden it came up 
[01:34:30]  in the news that he was charged with stalking her.  Oh, boy.  And when he was arrested, he was arrested for stalking her, having a suspended license,  and he had HGH in the car.  Which is human growth.  Human growth hormone.  Yes.  Steroid.  And he was on our show saying that he's not doing anything.  Right.  And none of us called him out, and I kicked myself for that one.  He's a tough guy.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Like, why call him out, though?  True. 
[01:35:00]  He was a mess.  Yeah.  It would be like kicking a poor fucking puppy.  Fuck, he had everything, man.  He was the shit.  He had the world by the balls.  What happened as far as WWE goes and Kurt Angle?  I mean, it depends.  He's told a bunch of different stories.  Yeah.  Like, he's one of those guys that's, I mean, he's lied a lot.  Yeah.  So, I mean, but there was, there was accusations of drug use and possibly he needed to go to rehab or not.  Ah.  And there was either, at one point he said he needed time off and Vince McMahon wouldn't give it to him. 
[01:35:30]  Other people have said he had to go to rehab and he wouldn't go, so he left the company.  And, you know, there's very, it's very strange.  He said, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Ooh.  Like Amy Winehouse.  Of course.  But so now he's saying that he wasn't stalking her, she was setting him up.  And he went on the Pittsburgh News and he told his story and then he got a little emotional.  Got a little emotional. 
[01:36:00]  One of those classic crying clips.  I think you guys will enjoy it.  The first couple tracks.  Where does it, where does it.  I think you'll enjoy it.  This is terrible.  Where does it match up, though?  Is it as good as a wrestling fan?  No.  Or as good as Michael Schmidt?  Oh, my God.  Mike Schmidt is the best.  Where are we at with this?  It's the.  Two bad knees.  What?  You know the.  Can we hear that?  I know.  Now I just want to hear that.  Every time it's referenced, it has to be played.  You got to hear it.  Michael.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees. 
[01:36:30]  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Did a dream come true?  I think the dream came true.  Oh, my God.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Oh, my God.  Oh, did you see that shirt? 
[01:37:00]  You had best un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck.  Exactly.  Wow.  Fucking suck it up, dude.  So, here we go.  Kurt Angle on the Pittsburgh news.  Right.  He has like a local news.  He's from Pittsburgh.  The first couple tracks, he's just explaining his side of the story.  Before the breakdown?  Yeah.  Yes.  The evening of August 15th, I was at my residence. 
[01:37:30]  Hold on.  Two seconds.  He sounds fucked up.  I mean.  I'm not even saying drugs fucked up or anything or whatever.  He sounds like he's mentally fucked up.  Yeah.  Well, if we go back to the evening.  That doesn't even sound like Kurt Angle.  He's not the same guy as the guy.  You remember doing all like the comedy and everything.  Oh, yeah.  He's hilarious.  Yeah.  He's very funny.  He's a very animated. 
[01:38:00]  A great character.  Yeah.  Let me reiterate that.  He's gone through that all day.  Yeah, I guess so.  Let's hear a little of Kurt Angle.  15th.  I was at my residence and it was probably about the 10th time I broke up with this girl.  I've asked him to leave my house 50 or 60 times. 
[01:38:30]  50 or 60?  Please leave.  Please leave.  Please leave.  Please leave.  Please leave.  Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.  And now do 40 more of those.  Yeah.  Come on.  50 or 60 times.  Wow.  God damn.  It must be a good catch.  You don't want to leave.  50 or 60 times.  i asked her that she can move in temporarily um uh she behind my back got a mailing address at 
[01:39:00]  my house which made her a resident oh shit um that in turn gave her the right to file a pfa  against me and have me kicked out of my house so what sparked this pfa um she she wanted to  she wanted to get married she wanted me to get her a ring and i said there's no way possible  i said there are a lot of red flags here i didn't think her and i could get along what's a pfa it's  like a restraining order type of deal sounds like that so like she's filed a restraining order 
[01:39:30]  saying you can't come within whatever feet of me i'm in my house which is his house yeah so  so now he can't go to his house because she filed a mailing address are you kidding yeah that's a new  federation what the pfa good one there pat him and jake the snake are the big names in the pfa i believe  it's his protection from abuse okay that's what i'm getting here so he files that so now because  he did that he can't go home no no she filed it but she he said she went behind his back and registered 
[01:40:00]  herself as a resident at his house when she was living there ah so now that's her place of residence  it's leave leave leave leave leave leave leave he didn't say enough you know what joe pesci said it  best it's the bitches that'll get you wow that's a that's a wow that's a ballsy move on her part  wow if she really did that you know with kurt uh who knows but he also really did that wow he also  said she was constantly trying to get him to hit her like she wanted him to hit her really with a 
[01:40:30]  frying pan wow yeah wow yeah let's continue with the curtain story i left you know i didn't want to be in  any trouble i got out i hurried up and called my manager i called the owner of my company tna  and um they said don't go back to the house uh within 14 minutes a police officer pulled me over  and uh said that i violated my pfa he also said i had a suspended license which i don't i do have a 
[01:41:00]  valid license and he found a prescription in the car which i had a i have a um i have a prescription for  um and i wait yeah it's easy just to say that all this is not true why would the cop say that  he has a suspended license yeah now 14 minutes and he just casually says that he has a a prescription  for hgh he got busted for dui so like a year ago so that's why the cop said your license is suspended  a suspended the license it's suspended the license i guess he had a deficiency in human 
[01:41:30]  growth hormone ah so he must have yeah yeah so he had a prescription for valid valid yeah  for um and i said there's no way i violated i violated my pfa because i just left my house  he said well she's here and i didn't see her but they ended up handcuffing me putting me in a car  and take me to jail so so you were not stalking her at the time no she was stalking me she we 
[01:42:00]  finally got a surveillance camera of me leaving my gated community and then her car came just about  two minutes after mine so she was following you yeah she was supposed to be staying at my house  and she got in her car right away and followed me so his story is that yeah she gets him to leave  his house yeah and then right after he leaves she follows him and then calls the police and says  he's stalking me he's right here he's stalking me and he said well i left the house and the cop 
[01:42:30]  goes no she's right here yeah and he went like fuck yes she was probably following him so the cops know  where he is because she was probably a bit scared of the guy i don't think she was following him at  all right at all okay you're taking rock a con side in this one i think i'm on rock a con  i'm on rafa con's side  he couldn't have been nicer to her when he was on our show he said she was a wonderful person and a  and a great friend so i will chase thee over the gated communities i spit at thee this is where it 
[01:43:00]  gets good he starts to break down yes i i i i'm not the stalking kind of person i don't i'm i'm i'm  um i don't like confrontation uh so i i kind of walked away from a wrestler um this is really  hard for me i uh uh oh you know i i spent nine hours in in the jail and it was the lowest point  in my life i mean oh i didn't do anything wrong and uh i was i'm sitting here in a county jail 
[01:43:30]  i can't do this oh my god this is so horrible you get so uncomfortable but then you have to  wow this is douchey  what is it about the breakdown of a male oh it's just horrible you can't listen to it but then you  have to and then you gotta openly mock it yeah you don't want to listen but you have to you're right 
[01:44:00]  yeah what it what it wait wait okay let me you gotta rewind a little bit oh oh you do like i'm  why would i even think you didn't i i apologize i said i can't do this but of course i can that's  hysterical he he he spent how much time in the jail nine hours wow all right nine hours well i could  see how that could break a man yeah well hey withdrawals just saying okay yeah if if if the rumors are  true nine hours could be a long nine hours it could be this point in my life i mean i didn't do anything 
[01:44:30]  wrong and uh i was i'm sitting here in a county jail and just thinking about why i even started dating  this girl so um let's see uh i can't believe she did this to me uh i don't even know when i'm allowed  back to my own home so uh um i just hope that the hearing goes okay and then i can get back to my 
[01:45:00]  house and move on with my life that's all i want i mean i don't want any trouble i just i just want my  life back i don't even have that now oh oh kurt why didn't he call our show and give the story  i guess because he thought we might mock him yeah huh oh we would have listened to him 
[01:45:30]  hmm no my health doesn't allow yeah well it's a prescription does he break down further well  the thing is he picks himself back up oh good but then he goes back down oh no what are you going to do  now i'm gonna sit um wait for trial uh go see my family i guess my daughter's spot on tv um oh geez 
[01:46:00]  it's just really hard uh my ex-wife has been real supportive wow she has told everybody the kind of  person i really am oh that's supportive um it'll be good to see them i'm set to see them tomorrow so  uh that'll make me feel good jesus oh no how bad did this look by the way oh it was bad he didn't  he didn't have the huge crocodile tears or anything but because like i said he keeps picking himself back

[02:05:30]  the black community as much as the white uh community dude has though dude dude but really  like yo dude yo dude yeah but you have to pronounce it we have to change it dude dude dude dude  but fucking fucking douche is great it's a good one oh thank you for douche we've loved that one for  quite a while don't rework that word just use it like we do no douche he's a douche no i love it hey  so uh you're at anthony's for the big party yeah i was away i wanted to be there so bad yeah it was 
[02:06:00]  fun it was you took over the grill and as you call it well first of all it was a sausage fest but it  wasn't gay it's weird guys floating around in pools i i why did you make it a sausage fest i don't  understand that i just kind of want it because we've had parties at the house where it's like the guys and  and their chicks and everything and guys i they just take on a different dynamic when their chicks  are there there's like this different attitude you can't just hang out and goof the whole time 
[02:06:30]  there's going to be some part where the chick goes like oh could you do i need to  some fucking drama or some bullshit so i just hindsight 2020 genius i just thought it's  fucking cool to get all the guys because when we're here in the studio and it's all the guys we're  just sitting knocking the shit out of each other having fun so i figured why not do that at the  house i think it would be a blast i had a great time only that only can work though i did some uh  mental under trying to understand why that worked yeah everybody in the house physically and mentally 
[02:07:00]  are finished so if it was a house full of 25 year old guys it'd be like what the fuck exactly what is  this is this faggot ass shit but it's a bunch of just it was old men in a house  and no one's trying to get pussy no one's trying to do just people sitting there yeah  everything was righteous we weren't out for the hunt it was not it was not on and it was nothing  funnier to me than to tell my girl because she was getting all ready for it oh it's oh 
[02:07:30]  shit i showed a key so uh yeah anthony said it's just the guys just guys and i had to uninvite my  girl oh and just how annoyed she was she just like how annoyed i didn't take pics and stuff i  didn't want to do that but i really wanted to take a pic of the pool and just dudes in a jacuzzi  eating it was fucking anthony norton um who looked like he was just cooking and all 
[02:08:00]  norton just looks he's just like a mollusk a little slug a little scallop oh he's just awful like a  butterball well like like someone set a butterball turkey adrift it looks like he would be very tasty  if you grilled him you know what i mean a little butter yeah olive oil on there he is he he would  have he would have a lot of marble meat he's a little ribeye oh he'd be so juicy and he was just 
[02:08:30]  it was him it was kenny it was uh norton anthony and uh anthony's uh brother just in the jacuzzi  uh sam who was another one is and it was the worst was sam conditioned a party i've ever seen  there was just was sam in the pool oh yeah sam got in the pool uh what does that look like without  clothes it what does that look like without clothes i'm gonna tell you i think he doesn't have a  i think danny's father had the best the best physique i think and that's that's very very sad 
[02:09:00]  sam's funny because sam sam is obviously a thin guy he weighs next to nothing but then he gets  that shirt off and he's got like a little like a little pudgy oh it's nothing worse he's got  like a little gut hair on his nipples on it's just it's just as it's just something you go i wish  if i had a body that that wouldn't happen to me who's chasing around is kenny chasing  it's just kenny was kenny's figure is awful and again this is me talking it was just you know what 
[02:09:30]  women didn't need to be there before the evening no just come later it was great the grilling  the food was delicious i heard you took over the grill yeah patrice did what did you think of  anthony's house it was amazing oh dude a tear came down my mind it does it's just uh thank you  it's a it's a it's a beautiful you know what it is it's a it's a gentleman's house it's not too  um gross grossly overdone it's very understated um it's nothing i mean he ain't got a little bit of 
[02:10:00]  for michael here and there that's the italian but that's that's the italian he's representing  and that's i'm gonna concrete the whole front yard so you know from time to time you go  eh well a shiny chair but you know what i'd have done that different a lot of patio furniture yeah  yeah but it has a lot of parties you guys i'm just teasing man i'm fucking it's it's it's beautiful i  love being there it was like and then uh uh it makes me cry i didn't get shit for my money 
[02:10:30]  his movie room is just ridiculous right oh the theater yes that was fun like you have to when  you congratulate him like as you're doing it you should always understand that someone has deep  inside there's the the green monsters the green eye monster so you should be able to say anthony i  want to burn your fucking house down and then you go you can live with it because you you go to your  house what you think i think my house is pretty okay sure poorly built house from syntax homes 
[02:11:00]  and uh that's why i didn't show up yesterday fucking some driplets coming through my ceiling  so i had a ceiling leak yeah and it's just like from the roof yeah and it made me want to uh  my my refrigerator i thought that you know i got the part with for water to come out yeah and that  busted up and uh and i've had for a year i've had uh people coming out trying to fix my refrigerator  and i knew and it's nothing worse than people that fix just like the doctor you need doctor i can't see 
[02:11:30]  out of my left eye ah nah you're all right i'm going blind in my left eye motherfucker please do  something help me don't tell me nothing just say i'd rather you go say go fuck yourself that's your  eyes but the refrigerator used to have water coming out of it like it would fill up a gallon i had no  problem pushing that button and a gallon of water come out at some point it just started dribblets so  the guy comes and changes oh yeah these the fucking the zaba zaba zaba breaks yeah took it off they put it 
[02:12:00]  on i push it he goes he's sitting there the the repair guy he's fucking and no ethic no ethic he  just goes hey it's working right you know just sign this i go it is working but do you see what's  happening do you see that i i bought two brita brittas big brita bottle things because i now can't  have the patience to let water come out of my fridge to have a piss out like that so i i'm just 
[02:12:30]  sitting in my room and i see drips come out and oh shit the whole time it was the the broken faucet  in the fridge yeah and it and luckily it wasn't dripping down for years it just dripped down for  a while for like maybe it had to be two weeks came through the ceiling had to cut the ceiling had to  dry it out so there's no mold had to do this and had to do and here's and here's how fucking horrible  i've been my whole life i'm like you know you don't you always like to be a man in front of your  woman and i held my fucking head in my hand i go who do i call that's what i do who do i call 
[02:13:00]  we're so lame i don't have a landlord anymore i'm like oh god i'm my own landlord who do i call  for this i don't even know i don't know who to call help me call kenny it won't cost you much  kenny knows what to do no kenny would know any problem you have you go kenny i have this problem  and he will hook you up and then you got to pay a tiny just a tiny little service charge he knows 
[02:13:30]  but that service charge is so worth it kenny knows he won't do it you tell him what he knows who to  call yeah you tell him what your problem is and he'll set the whole fucking that's what he does for  me yeah like keith if something happens uh i go uh keith i need like this done and keith goes all  right and he is fucking happy to do it that son of a bitch is territory over his baby anthony i'm  gonna tell you when uh patrice took the grill over uh keith was like what the fucking silent war 
[02:14:00]  between a big black man and a cop oh my god over the grill i'm not racist but i'd rather have a black  man on the grill and i'm not even front well keith started off wrong and he was yeah yeah he he put  coals in the entire fucking grill anthony has a big weber and you can't do that you just gotta you  gotta stack the half and put it half here patrice is gonna have different heat right yes it's gonna 
[02:14:30]  have different heat level patrice knows where on the grill it's going to be a certain temperature  and everything came out perfect perfect yeah i i was i was proud of myself i didn't even want to  eat anthony told no one they can eat that last piece of chicken i was like no patrice has to get  that fucking last piece of chicken and then and then my friends came to see me perform at some point  yeah we were we were halfway friends went to cleveland and uh saw patrice  fucking hysterical had a great time man crowd up there patrice hooked me up you know something 
[02:15:00]  i've done a lot of trashing on cleveland as a city even strong for us man always um i i cannot  i can still trash the city yeah it's the it's the walking dead it's the weirdest i had to get in a cab  and drive seven miles to get something to eat at about nine o'clock i will say as a city the  infrastructure stinks yeah it's weird but they know that people yeah absolutely probably  i would i'll put them the third all-time right now as people i gotta say dc first and then i'll say 
[02:15:30]  philly second then i'll say cleveland but cleveland may pass philly if i go there a couple of times  that's how good the people were they gave up on their downtown area everyone will tell you that it  i was in the hyatt it's but yes and i looked at a homeless zombie wind yeah and death it just looks  like post-apocalyptic yeah i said oh my god yeah you know you get up you you do the the do things  you open up the big and you're like there's no one this is horrible nothing's there's no 
[02:16:00]  there's no uh uh traffic yeah there's no rush hour you could stand in the middle of the street too  and no cars at eight nine in the morning it's like it's really the oddest thing i've never seen  that how do they call that a city as soon as you walk out of the hotel the homeless people attack  you immediately like zombies for money it's the closest thing to a zombie city it's unbelievable  it's a mall close and it's like luckily it's the black mall i mean it was just nothing but 
[02:16:30]  you know post high school girls walking around and i was just sitting by the fountain being a piece of  shit eating popcorn and looking at them come out the footlocker with their new kicks oh i wanted to buy  a kilth so i could just reach down and just jack my dick because he's fucking delicious young  things walking around and i they have no interest in me at all no i admit this i i it's really a rough  one i'm i'm relegated to uh old broads that's it i know it and i try to do that old man that old man 
[02:17:00]  mysterious who's that old man kind of feel to me they just comes off as creepy nothing that's who's this  quiet guy by himself nothing just a fat a fat for your old man that can't fuck me ever  trying to sit there like what's he eating something different from what i mean 
[02:17:30]  trying to be james bond yeah yeah that's it james bond give me a diet coke uh shaking not stirred please  patrice also commented on uh on uh the women's asses yeah he said like what's wrong with their  asses some of the biggest giant asses in cleveland big asses in cleveland dude if you like giant asses  yeah if you're a regular listen up danny if you like women with giant asses yeah go to  fucking cleveland i was noticing that cleveland has giant and i'm gonna tell you because my girl's probably 
[02:18:00]  listening so she's like but i'm gonna tell you if i need to scoop something up  cleveland i'm scooping up three in cleveland because they're fucking they're they're downtrodden  yeah and they need a man after each show walk out because after i'm trashing women for about 45  minutes yeah exactly and they only got one year left to what when lebron leaves that city changes  drastically oh boy they won't let him leave they'll kill him first 
[02:18:30]  but why would he leave you know what i think from being a god to being you know what i think  king you know what i think lebron's gonna do he's gonna he's gonna make an understanding with with uh  with the team he's gonna say look i'll give you two more years you know i can leave now you know i  want to leave you know i want to go to a bigger market but you guys have been good to me i'm gonna  give you two more solid years to try to make this thing happen and then after that all bets are off i'm  i'm gonna tell you why he's not leaving you think he stays there i'm gonna tell you why he's not 
[02:19:00]  leaving sorry that's sports no it's okay they the asians bought asians bought a lot of that that  whole situation they bought the the quick and longs arena they bought some of the team they bought a lot  of shit and i think they bought it so they can guarantee they'll make lebron global man they he's  gonna be go like they're gonna push him in china they'll put he'll be bigger than jordan ever was  and they can pay him 200 million dollars knicks are not gambling and they'll they'll do anything 
[02:19:30]  they can do to get people in so they can win they got they got shaq even though it's a it's a  a lesser version of shaq they picked up shaq you still got shaq he got something this is the year  though he second year of shaq's contract it's it's you can get one year this year with shaq so so i'm  saying cleveland has a couple of years in but they're still gonna pay this guy 200 million  and they're gonna get any they're gonna get do whatever they can do to pay people to come in 
[02:20:00]  because they got them chinese people i didn't know about that that's a good angle yeah man  he ain't going nowhere why would they do that everything they got that local giant 80  fucking story high goddamn well poster everywhere there's a picture of lebron in the city as big as  the building this whole sides of buildings have his fucking picture i just  i'm feeling like guys like lebron though they want to play for the lakers the knicks you know  a couple other teams in there maybe maybe chicago i don't know maybe i wouldn't i wouldn't have thought 
[02:20:30]  so until he started getting those big markets you know you know they they want to be in the big  markets but if if these guys do the right thing then maybe that doesn't why would he leave there  if you're born if you if there's a if there's a professional team in new mexico you were born there  raised there played there in high school and then when you turn pro you they consider you one of the  the best players that ever lived already and you happen to get drafted by new mexico's team  why would you they do it why would you leave they leave when they can he's he's he's from 
[02:21:00]  he's in ohio everything was self yeah it was boxed in it was like god did that for cleveland  they did and they need it cleveland needs it i'm i used to be anti cleveland right i'm pro cleveland i want  cleveland after coming from cleveland those people need they need the same thing people  from pittsburgh need they just need something they need something even though pittsburgh got  their sports teams are phenomenal yeah and their title town really except for except for the eagles 
[02:21:30]  pennsylvania's big time yeah but you get to certain feelings of some of these these towns and you just  go you know what i left going i wish i wish cleveland well hey we i wish thee well as you just  just i wish cleveland well as always pack at two in the morning for a 12 midnight noon flight  i i i've noticed something here there's a love fest between you two really i think you guys bonded  finally we really did i think you finally bonded with patrice officially officially with patrice there 
[02:22:00]  was always uh like uh and would keep his distance a little bit no but that's just me but not anymore  i see there's a bonding that happened between the the party and then and going up to cleveland  i don't keep my distance with anybody like like uh patrice in particular it's everybody no i know  in general you do that it when when i get to know somebody a little more then you know it's a little  it's a little different now i see it why it's why you say that and i'm gonna tell you this because i  i don't smiling at each other a little bit a little wink in your eye  you're lying over radio hey we've shared a little where's the fucking cameras i did a

[02:29:30]  you know if you're talking about just pathetic because we have messes all fucking messes but i was the  only black guy there though yeah true driving up to his house was very uncomfortable really what  makes you uncomfortable about i got a big red truck and his street and there was an italian guy on the  phone who and i'm not i'm not exaggerating he he was on the phone and he took the phone off his face  to stare at my truck riding down to get to anthony's house yeah he took i'm not exact he's on the phone 
[02:30:00]  i imagine he sounds like this yeah and then he just took the phone off his face oh you know what  he must have said when he put the phone back to his face holy shit what the fuck just drove by but  no wait a minute stop you gotta hear what i just saw drive by motherfucker holy shit i'm telling you  what imagine the first sentence when he got back on the phone exactly and i was scared going home too  i was a little nervous till i got on the lie going on expressway and once i got on there but it 
[02:30:30]  took a couple of seconds a couple of twists and turns and you're like getting there and leaving  but being there was beautiful man it's a bit of a puzzle to get to oh it's a beautiful bathrooms  everywhere i like anthony doesn't care 15 feet what's going on in his house no you know i saw the  fucking guns the gun collection it wasn't scary it was very put all the shit he says about guns  it you you picture something uncomfortable but really it's all neat if i had guns if i was 
[02:31:00]  allowed to have guns it'd be just thrown about no i i would be thinking you know boy oh boy but it  was a you know you open a gun a nice desert eagle beautiful it looks like it's not for weaponry it  looks like it's yeah it's just like it's a completely as a gentleman's house big shower  fucking with the sit down you know i'm i'm walking by the the my jealousy and the reflection of where  i am in my life as a man i'm looking around going hey man how come here's what my dumb ass says i go 
[02:31:30]  this i'm in a mansion how come no crown molding and then i said and then no and then fucking keep  goes no he got him no it's up there oh it's it's the entire ceiling not just the corners like my  house and i apologize to keith because what a dick i was by going but i'm in the house going trying to  find something i'm hoping a roach crawls in like fantastic there's a roach in anthony's house 
[02:32:00]  i was like it's beautiful i was lucky enough to see the house when there was nothing in it  nothing no pool no backyard no furniture no nothing for for about a year right till i broke  up uh till me and the girlfriend broke there was barely anything in the house there was like  a card table for the laptop and and sort of a couch and a bed i had that was it not even a place i had  like another computer sitting on a fucking like dinner tray one of those fold-out wooden dinner tray 
[02:32:30]  things and and i had a beanbag chair and a big screen tv in the kitchen hooked up to the x-box  and i would just play fucking call of duty with a glass of wine and sitting on the  fucking hardwood floor something something got him motivated because that's that's that's the  real anthony by the way the breakup but the breakup got motivated and then and then angela keith's wife  uh was like anthony you know you want me to help you out and coming because she's really good at  decorating she came in and just because i'm not going to sit there and look at swatches of 
[02:33:00]  fucking material and then look at a couch and try to picture what that couch is going to look like  that's the who do i call so it was just like fucking here you go it was a seat is he has a  leather chair with an ottoman right i guess no one oh yeah yeah really no i sat there and i just  yeah patrice like sunk into this thing he looked like i wanted to just keep him there  look to your corner there's a nigga in my chair  and i'm just still like this until you give me a quarter then i move for a second 
[02:33:30]  myself but there's a space on his wall that i just was sitting there i think had to be 20 minutes  going i wonder what what would i put there like there's an empty space and i'm going what would  i put there i argue that with an i'm like leave it as is could leave it like that could put a triptych  up there i think i like three i think it like some kind of a almost like a sculpture but a wall  sculpture i said a half a motorcycle half a motorcycle i'm sorry a half a motorcycle i don't 
[02:34:00]  like it it's a giant wall like a big moose head or something up there big moose get a moose one that  talks like it's like hi everybody like the fish and it moves yeah every fucking 15 minutes the moose  talks hi everybody but nope i was uh i was uh you know i was it was just it was emotional being it  because i really uh want to just relax like that that's a good house to die oh it's just 
[02:34:30]  fucking really i that's what i like just sitting down grabbing a beer and fucking relaxing yeah that's  it that's why i don't like going to his house because then i'm like but i hear you got a nice  place man i got a nice view but you got how many square feet five thousand i got i got four rooms  in manhattan four bedrooms but what's the square footage i don't know for real i don't know i don't  know that three thousand i really don't know find out find out so i can probably be jealous if you 
[02:35:00]  say less than three thousand i'm i'm not gonna have proper jealousy four bedrooms and a and a nice  size living room yeah a real big living room and then a foyer area a little foyer full foyer it's  big invite me to the house but i think you would think i was too close to to what to to the little  lady it's too close it's not it's not far enough space between me and this woman no i think opie 
[02:35:30]  here's what i think opie and this is what i think he would he would watch how hard i would sit on his  furniture just in case i would think i would that i sat down i would i think i would sit down  and here's some kind of creek and opa go oh and his wife will have a little discussion in the back  did you hear did you hear that you so got that wrong i had that delivered it took five months  and then he comes flop as fat as i wasn't you got that so wrong what do you think anthony do with 
[02:36:00]  the chair you sat in you think he's sitting in that every day right but  my place is i give you a tour we look at the view which is amazing and then we go get lunch  we get it right out of there that's all you do with my place unlike anthony's where it's like you  want to go you want to go down and check out a movie you want to do a live broadcast do you want  to go out to the pool area you want to grill i don't have any of that true that so what do we do 
[02:36:30]  we could sit down and order food and and and watch a movie or something yeah it's completely different  than but the fucking curve is is is messed up because we've been over his house but if you go from  somewhere to your place you'd be like oh let's just hang out i'm sure you got a 50 incher  in there you got to of course you do got a 50 in white trash has every tv's mounted 
[02:37:00]  what's wrong with that it's just it's you don't mount every television doesn't get mounted on your  wall you know why you don't mount everything everything everything's mounted i got five because  you know why no wires no nothing it's all internal it goes right from the back of the tv into that's  right you don't see a component i'm with you you don't see why that's where we're the same i got  five mounted tvs you got what five tvs my basement looks like nasa i got a room that looks like 
[02:37:30]  fucking nasa because i don't want wires and my computer screen is as big as that top tv right  there because it's an old tv i turn it into a monitor oh so i got i got six tvs technically you can't  mount why what are you supposed to do with them i mount all my tvs you have some rooms you just you  change up like you put the tv on a stand they're like pictures on the wall yeah you know what it is  though like like i have some uh uh like a dresser with the the tv mounted about four inches above 
[02:38:00]  the dresser so instead of it being on the dresser right you can use that space now it's like for your  clones again you have to understand this is the jealous part of me who wants that house so i can  make it the way i i want to make it it's fucking amazing and the most amazing thing i'll i'll go  three three things in order one number one is probably the pool just be able to go out in that  pool is it nice the warm pool i didn't go in no i didn't i didn't expect your tussies in didn't you 
[02:38:30]  i didn't even i think i touched it it was it was i think it was 116 degrees  um everybody it just was a comfortable thing the outside was very calm i would say pools number one  followed real real close by the the movie theater that thing is ridiculous i mean a movie theater is  is you use it a lot yeah i use it you know enough enough it's not like you know it doesn't get used  it's just it's just amazing did you sit down and watch anything i had to get out my jealousy 
[02:39:00]  and envy i had to go we were watching a piece of a movie kill bill yeah kill bill and it was better  than if you seen it at the movies you hear when it was a scene where she was fighting a little  uh japanese girl go yeah and you can hear when when she threw the ball and it crunched into the  and then she put you just hit a the wood crunch like like yeah it just was like and i go i gotta get  out of here what am i gonna do i'm gonna end up stealing one of his chairs and so and the third 
[02:39:30]  i would say is the is the now the gun collection is amazing but i i'll fucking say like where i go  i gotta have this one day in my house is that that fucking his shower  fucker has a shower that you need in your life man with the bench and all that sit down  you sit down big thing you need that it's i used to hate fucking got a tiny little shower in your  place who when you wash your hair regular human being shower but you have your own place you can't 
[02:40:00]  figure out how to make it bigger let me tell you what i don't have it's my own place i have to  fucking ask permission to do things to my house oh because you got a condo yeah see that's what i got  damn it we don't have a choice in that if you live in the city you don't really have i gotta get  permits but you know yeah not for you inside your house no no or outside your house outside for the  pool and everything no not just i have to ask permission i could put like windows no i could  on your house i could pretty much rip my shit up if i want to pretty much inside yeah pretty much 
[02:40:30]  yeah see but but then the house though at least look at the condo association you go  hey there's no they didn't get the garbage or some shit when you own your house it's like  everything is your responsibility yeah a little bit is theirs a little bit but still i rather own my  house and yeah you're not like running around your house changing air conditioning filters and  shit like that right and i would get married too in your house though really i would have i would get  married and why would you do that you'd give away you saw the house in half and go here now you 
[02:41:00]  potentially will get this i'd have to have life more life uh i would have to have a family in there  yeah like just somebody some girl that i thought was deemed worthy of right living in that house  because i'm sitting there going i'm thinking of all the places i can hide from my girl yeah i'm like  perfection she'd find me she really need to but she wouldn't just be right there that's why we don't  live together because it's just too close i don't want to see like there's a lot of doors to shut 
[02:41:30]  which is nice i could go into the office and just yeah you can shut the doors and i feel like don  corleone yeah behind the desk the biggest waste in anthony's house is the kitchen that kitchen is  amazing but i don't think you use it oh no it gets it's gonna get used by the way uh uh the big uh  wedding is coming up what what yeah who's getting married my sister dawn and patrick at your house  that's brand news yep at my house right now i believe uh how much you know this

[02:44:30]  Oh yeah, it is.  You can only hope she  ends up a junkie.  That's what you just hope.  Just send... I have no ill will  upon anybody.  Just send some of that  methamphetamine  that goes through your skin.  When she opens up the letter, just get a little  bit of meth juice right on her fingers  and she's hooked. 
[02:45:00]  She'll be selling her house back to you.  No, this is called, I'm in the home stretch.  Let's not fuck it up.  That's what that's called.  Give her the fucking rest of the money now.  Yeah, so you don't fuck it up.  Just end it, man. Do you know what you're doing?  He's right.  That's evil on your heart, man. Just fucking...  Did I do that?  Yeah. You know how happy you'll be?  Get it over with.  It's like having a scab heel.  I want to get a big publisher's clearinghouse check, though.  And have like fucking 18-year-old girls deliver it.  And then blow me on the front stoop. 
[02:45:30]  Anytime I give my girl a check on the memo line,  just because she does nothing to deserve it.  I just put for...  Just being a lazy cunt.  On the memo line, I go,  if you not cashed this,  the pain of going to the bank with this on your check  is worth what I just gave you.  Just fucking...  You should get a fucking  Xerox copy of your ball imprint.  Dot the I. 
[02:46:00]  Dot the I.  Or any I's on there,  just dot it with your ball.  Put ink on your balls.  Dot the I with your ball ink  and have a fucking take that to the bank.  Holy shit.  God bless you.  Dot the fucking I with my ball.  That's really funny.  Oh, fuck, man.  With that, why don't we take a break?  That's cool.  Congratulations to Dawn and Pat.  Yeah.  That's nice.  No invitations have gone out yet, by the way.  It's going to be one of these...  It's not like a big, planned, like, giant wedding thing. 
[02:46:30]  It's going to be very...  You don't have to explain.  I understand.  No, she said that.  I think there's like...  I'm with you, O.B.  I think there's like 60 people invited.  Just stop, man.  You've got to be in there.  Anthony, just stop.  Yeah.  I understand.  All you have to do is just stop.  Just stop.  Just say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm invited.  I know I didn't make it easy over the years.  I know.  Trust me, I know.  It ain't...  Should I say this?  I'm trying to turn this thing around.  It ain't my fucking wedding.  I don't know who they're inviting.  It's my house, and you're cordially invited.  I can't even look at you. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No.  Fuck you.  Patrice, where are you going to be?  We've got to take a break.  I'm going to be in...  Next weekend, September 11th and 12th, I'm going to be doing my Connecticut tour.  Stratford, Connecticut, and Danbury, Connecticut, both at the Treehouse.  Those are 9 p.m. shows.  And then the 17th, 18th, and 19th, I'm going to be at the lovely Punchline in San Francisco,  my fourth favorite club.  Damn.  If not...  That is a great comedy club.  I love San Francisco.  I saw Norton there and someone else. 
[02:47:30]  Whatever.  You like San Francisco?  As a city, it doesn't impress me.  Like, it's the hills and shit.  It's just not...  I like the outskirts of San Francisco.  When you get out of the city, it's just amazing.  When you do certain things, it's a beautiful looking city.  But I do enjoy the fact that Asians have a fucking personality in San Francisco.  Ah.  Let's get into that after the break.  Yeah.  You know something?  They're everywhere.  Fucking...  I was trying to explain to my girl why the Asians are in San Francisco, and I couldn't  come up with a historical fact. 
[02:48:00]  They stopped.  That's where they stopped.  What was it?  Huge Chinatown.  Huge Chinatown.  They hit land after crossing the Pacific.  No, but why?  Historically, why did so many Asians end up in San Francisco?  I couldn't explain it to her.  Tons of them.  Huh?  Tons of them, and they're...  Whatever they are, they're second or third generation.  I've never bumped into an Asian-y Asian in fucking...  Asian-y.  You have a way of putting it.  I think it's like...  I think it's like Mexicans in Texas, things like that. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, but why?  Historically, why?  That's all.  Well, after World War II, you got a lot of Japanese came over.  After Vietnam, you got a lot of Vietnamese, Cambodians.  Did it have something to do with the shipping?  Once they come over...  Well, that's where you would hit first, is California, so...  That would be my guess.  Oh, yeah, from through China.  Yeah, from...  You would figure...  And Vancouver.  So...  Yeah.  So San Francisco, Van, all of that north, and for some reason, they ended up probably  coming through Hawaii.  And the Southern California, you know, the Mexicans got that.  Oh, that's easy. 
[02:49:00]  That's easy to figure out.  They wound up getting that from the Pacific.  Right, that's easy to figure out.  I just want to know why...  Great Asians...  Everyone has the answer on the phones, obviously.  How did we get Puerto Ricans in New York?  It's like, shouldn't Florida have gotten Puerto Ricans?  I know that Florida got Cubans.  That's a good goddamn...  But how did New York get Puerto Ricans?  That's a good goddamn question, man.  That's a great question.  We got a couple questions out there.  We'll get the answers next.  How's that?  Racial geography coming up.  How's your Twitter going there, Patrice?  Big Mama Prods, right?  Big Mama Prods, but if you put Patrice O'Neal, it'll come up, too. 
[02:49:30]  What?  If you put Patrice O'Neal, Big Mama Prods will come up.  Oh, damn.  On Twitter?  On Twitter.  That's handy.  You got to teach me how to do that.  Yeah, but you set it up as your email or whatever, and then you also give an alternate username  that people can find you under.  Right on.  Okay.  That is handy.  Big Mama Prods, man.  I get it out there.  And anybody that tweets me, I tweet them right back, but sometimes I don't have real great  tweets, so I don't tweet.  But when I have good tweets, I tweet. 
[02:50:00]  You're smart.  That's why you don't feel compelled to tweet when you don't have anything.  I'm a serial Twitter, but then I had to stop following Hammer, because Hammer take up space  on your phone.  Who's Hammer?  Hammer.  The Hammer?  The Hammer.  Nigga, stop tweeting so much.  Enough of you and your fucking tweets, Hammer.  I stop following him, because every second I see his goddamn something.  There's three things.  He's promoting something.  He's saying, what's up to somebody that no one else knows, or he's fucking giving you 
[02:50:30]  some kind of spiritual advice today.  You know what?  No.  I'm going to stop following Hammer.  And I'm going to stop following the fucking drummer from the roots if he doesn't stop fucking  tweeting.  Really?  Hey, man.  Life is grace.  You know what's funny about Twitter?  Inspirational messages.  Enough of you.  We all want to tweet more than we do.  And you notice, like, if you send that one tweet too many, you watch your followers go  brrrr.  And they let you know, too. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're gone.  And you're like, fuck, I knew I shouldn't have sent that last one.  But that's the difference between keeping some of your followers and them dropping out.  But then they slowly come back again.  Not because you're here in front of me, but he has just a proper amount of not much tweeting.  If you see, you'll see this little Grim Reaper thing he has.  I can't really call it.  I think you're, like, have a hood on and you're tweeting or something.  Right.  It's a nice little picture.  And you see it.  Every day you'll see it.  Yeah.  And it's not too much. 
[02:51:30]  It's not too much fucking Opie radio.  Just a proper amount.  You go, oh, he ain't got his little fucking.  Well, let me tell you the secret.  Because someone asked me about this.  I direct message.  Huh?  When I reply.  Smart.  The only time I actually hit reply is if I think it might be something that the masses that are on my Twitter.  A little RT on there or whatever.  Yeah, but someone wrote me.  They're like, I write you a lot and you always direct message me.  I'm like, yeah, because I don't want to, like, you know, fucking. 
[02:52:00]  Why lay it out there and have a conversation?  Because, like you said, MC Hammer saying hi to someone we don't know.  Who gives a shit, right?  So most of my replies, it's like something they said about the show or something.  It's like a quick thanks.  I appreciate it.  Blah, blah, blah.  Too much Hammer.  Yeah.  And fuck Hammer.  Too much.  Don't not fuck Hammer.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Let's fuck him.  Too much.  His comeback was a bust.  Let's move on.  Too much twammering.  That's right.  Stop twammering.  MC Twammer.  Enough of you. 
[02:52:30]  And fucking the drummer.  What's the drummer from the roots?  Yeah, I don't know his name.  What's that guy's name?  Quest Love.  Quest Love.  It's like Quest is another.  You're getting excessive Quest.  I like his twits, though.  And another one is Serena.  I followed her for a second.  Really?  Oh, boo.  Just I'm here waiting to go on fucking the show.  I saw one of her tweets.  She said something like, I'm getting ready to play a match.  I need some inspirational music.  Suggest a song. 
[02:53:00]  Make sure it's upbeat.  It's just enough.  Great Twitterers.  Shaq is a good Twitterer.  Yeah, Shaq?  Dwight Howard, if you're bored to death, he'll help.  Sports Twitter.  Fucking Ojo Cinco, great Twitterer.  Shaq is beyond talented.  He doesn't even need basketball anymore.  No.  This guy's going to continue with so much shit after he retires.  Good tweeter.  That guy's a talented motherfucker.  And E, wait, Cesar Millan?  I know he doesn't tweet his own, but whoever's in charge of it, fucking great Twitter to have Cesar Millan. 
[02:53:30]  Every once in a while, he'll go, hey, remember, if your dog bites you, just, you know, it's why he exists.  And he gives a little fucking, not a, hey, kiss your dog, remember.  It's like, hey, don't kick him in his ass.  A little word of wisdom.  You know, shock him with a taser.  It's like, fucking, it's that kind of tweet.  So it's some good tweet.  There it is.  Don't leave your dog in the car.  Summer temperatures make a car heat up fast. 
[02:54:00]  Dehydration could be the result.  Bam!  There it is.  And there's some good porno girl Twitters, too.  Porno girls, great Twitters.  I got the best, I got the best person I'm following.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  What's his name?  Maybe I'd say it after the break.  Keep these fuckers interested.  I know they sick of house talk, these motherfuckers.  But they all live in Long Island, they got houses.  I have confidence in this one.  All trash.  I have confidence in this one, and this Twitter account will blow up after the break. 
[02:54:30]  No, I don't know, because I got one.  I follow one.  Yeah, you got one, too?  I follow one that goes, getting ready to go suck some assholes on set.  All right.  That's good.  I got one, you got one?  Yeah.  We'll have a little competition after the break, and we'll see, and let Anthony decide who has  the better one.  Yeah, okay.  I got a real good one.  All right.  Real good one.  All right.  I'm confident.  All right.  I'm going to take one guess before we go?  Yeah.  Belladonna.  No, not, no. 
[02:55:00]  Those are good, though.  All right.  The individuals are good.  I'm thinking more.  Oh, okay.  All right, I can't guess that.  All right, fuck.  Because Belladonna, yeah, there's some good tweets there.  I've been known to check out the page every once in a while.  By the way, I listened to y'all the other day, and you trashed this guy.  Who?  It was so-  Who?  The book guy.  The book guy that made the book with the sayings.  Oh, was that a-  Is that a replay?  No, I don't think it was a replay.  We didn't do no book shit today, did we? 
[02:55:30]  It had to be during some kind of worst of the bro-cabulary.  Is that what you were listening to?  Was I listening to that?  I thought that was this week.  Nah.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It wasn't last week.  What's the one that I-  But I haven't listened to every show, so that's-  That was just-  That made me laugh, dude.  Was that the one where I peed on the book in front of him?  No.  You ever hear that?  Norton farted over the thing and was like,  Hey, what are you going to do?  I'm going to-  What was one of the words?  Bar-  Bar- 
[02:56:00]  It was a war room.  It was-  It must have been like a bro thing.  Bro-  It was corny-  Yeah, I think-  Words put together to make fucking-  Man words.  Words.  Yeah, I think it was the bro-cabulary book.  It was awful, but you didn't trash him.  Horrible.  But you'd get one of the best trashes I'll ever did without fucking trash it.  I thought it was live, but I just wanted to say that that was fucking-  That made me laugh.  I remember that one, yeah. 
[02:56:30]  I peed on a guy's book.  It was a really long pee, and he's on the phone.  It is-  I meant to really rub it in.  I go, Did you hear that?  He goes, Yeah.  He was so defeated.  Yeah.  I felt like such a fucking-  Yeah, I hear it.  Awful.  You're an asshole.  Keith in San Francisco.  They were brought in for railroad and stayed for the gold rush.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  The railroad.  Wow, they've been there since then.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  That's 1,800 there, son.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  I'm hanging up on Tony and PA, because he's got the Twitter account that I'm going to 
[02:57:00]  mention next.  He had it.  Oh, he did?  He did?  All right.  All you have to do is look up at that screen.  Tony, I want to acknowledge you had it.  Puerto Ricans are in New York because politicians flew them in after World War II.  What did that mean?  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  How do you fly Puerto Ricans in after World War II?  And you know something about Puerto Rico, it's got to be political because they're U.S.  citizens.  And here's a fact real quick.  I don't need a break, but the fact is Puerto Ricans, and you can dispute me,  but they are hated by all the other Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, all the other Hispanic.  They don't like them.  And Puerto Ricans treat them, Dominican, they treat them poorly because they treat them like  second-class citizens.  It's like, we don't have to swim here, but you do, by the way.  Right, because we can travel.  They're fucking citizens without even being American citizens.  That's why we'll never get rid of racism.  It's everywhere.  It's fucking everywhere.  It's inter...  Interracial.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Racism or whatever.  Cubans don't like Puerto Ricans.  Any fucking Latinos that have to come into this country illegally...  Look at Puerto Ricans and go, why the fuck do these guys get to just hop on a plane?  Can't stand...  And Puerto Ricans treat them like that.  Wow.  All right.  I talked to a Dominican.  Yeah.  And another thing.  I like this.  Argentina.  Why there's no black people in Argentina?  Really?  Everywhere else in South America has black people, not in Chile and Argentina.  Because during the middle passage of...  Keith, hold on. 
[02:58:30]  Two seconds.  I'm sorry.  Keith, if you're listening, book me a flight to Argentina.  All right.  No black people.  I'm serious.  If you want to go to South America, not see any blacks, Argentina or Chile.  Because all the Africans died on the trek over the Andes Mountains.  Couldn't make it.  Couldn't make it.  Couldn't make it to fuck the white women.  I'm serious.  History with Patrice.  History.  Couldn't make it to fuck all the white women and color up that country. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Let's get a break with that.  Jesus.  Hey, this is a good choice right here, Travis.  Coincidence or did you know what was going on?  I always know what's going on.  Look at that.  Look at that, Travis.  Knowing everything.  John Fogarty's in the building.  Oh, is he?  I would love to get him on the show.  You know John Fogarty?  That ain't gonna happen.  Is that in the black man's... 
[02:59:30]  Is that in the black man's world?  He's got the same riff when he makes it work every time.  Can I be ashamed?  I'm ashamed.  I'm gonna say it because I'm still learning about white people.  I saw a documentary on PBS about a guy that I should know.  White people, God.  But I saw an hour special of him.  Neil Young.  Oh, really?  I didn't know he existed, but he is a...  Loved the Neil Young.  He is a...  He's an artist, artist. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  He is one of the biggies.  The guys who we love, love him.  Didn't know about...  Never really embraced who he was.  But I also hate him because I went...  I've told the story too many times.  There's got to be a limit to the stories that we tell.  When it hits like the 10th time you're telling a story on the air...  Well, give me the show out there that should be keeping track and go, nope, you've already  told that story 10 times.  Don't say it again.  All right.  I'm a huge Neil Young fan.  One of the bands I had listened to growing up with my brothers.  And me and my brother...  Let me make sure this is the right guy, though. 
[03:00:30]  Is this the guy...  What was his first group?  He was with Crosby, Stills, Nash...  Nash and Young.  Okay, great.  Okay, yeah.  That's the guy.  Okay.  So he's got a million hits and I grew up listening to him.  And me and my brother finally went to the Felt Forum, I think it was, to see Neil Young.  We're like, holy shit, we're finally seeing him after all these years.  Never saw him in concert.  I don't think.  Maybe I did.  Whatever.  Seen so many fucking shows.  And song after song after song after song after song.  Unfamiliar because of what you just said. 
[03:01:00]  He's a true artist.  He's not playing any hits.  He's not playing anything we know.  You have to be so hardcore into Neil Young to really enjoy what he was doing up there.  And people argue this point with me all the time.  Play the fucking hits.  I'm sorry.  When you're paying whatever it was, over $100 a ticket to see Neil Young, and those were for average seats, you deserve some hits.  If you want to go and say, hey guys, to my fan base, tweet it, whatever. 
[03:01:30]  I'm going to be playing your city, but I'm going to warn you, I'm going to be a true artist.  I'm not going to play any hits, but I'm going to keep the ticket price down so you can maybe check out a different side of me.  But when you're paying a lot of money for a ticket, you should be able to hear some hits.  I'll take it just a little step further.  I don't think that when you sing your hits, I don't want you to even make a variation.  No, no.  If Prince is singing Purple Rain, I want him to sing Purple.  I don't want him to go, Purple, Purple, Purple, Purple Rain.  I don't want him to do it. 
[03:02:00]  I want you to fucking sing it exactly how I know it.  Just like I know it.  Then I can tell you the Bob Dylan story.  Wow.  I had to ask for some translations to the guy sitting next to me.  No, this is subterranean homesick blues.  I'm like, what?  Really?  Cigars and Scotch and Denver Pest both saying at the same time, Clapton is another asshole when it comes to not playing his hits.  It's not right.  If you're taking 100, it's probably even higher now for fucking tickets. 
[03:02:30]  So, guy behind me, way more excited to see Neil Young than us.  And every song, he's just screaming and screaming, and he's just so excited.  Because he's just assuming that there's going to be some hits eventually, and you can hear his energy level dropping as it goes.  He finally sits down.  He puts his freaking, you know, he's folding his arms, and he's like, bullshit, bullshit.  He's getting so pissed.  And then when it was really silent after maybe the, honestly, 12th or 15th song without a hit, he stands up and he actually says, it's one of the best things I've ever heard at a concert. 
[03:03:00]  Hey, Neil, how about one for us?  Self-serving, just fucking playing for himself up there.  How about one for us?  Instead of like, you know, he's basically saying, yeah, you're playing the whole person just for yourself.  Everybody heard it.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And what did Neil do?  I don't remember, because now it's a few years ago.  I mean, he ended up having maybe five songs you know.  Maybe.  In that documentary I saw, I was a fan of his. 
[03:03:30]  I mean, meaning a fan of his, who he is.  He's a fucking real piece of, you know, work, man.  He had, I mean, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young were humongous, evidently.  The group that he had before that was humongous.  But he's anti-fame, but he wants, I don't know what it is.  He wants his music out there.  But you go, wow.  But he's a true artist, because everybody who talks about him shakes their head. 
[03:04:00]  Well, this has got.  And goes, fuck.  I got to get Richard on, because there is another side of this.  Go ahead, Richard.  Yeah, I saw Neil Young in Toronto about five months ago, and he played every hit.  Yeah, that's good.  No, no, that's good.  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Go.  No, no, you go ahead.  That's your show.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Richard.  Yeah, I think there was maybe two or three songs that weren't that popular, but yeah, he played. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, for fucking Canadians he does that.  I guess for Americans he says, go fuck yourself.  I think in all fairness, when I saw Neil Young, he was going, because, I mean, you'll admit,  as a Neil Young fan, he goes through these stages where he will do stuff like this.  You know that, Richard, right?  Yeah.  But, I mean, all right, if he's back to playing the hits, you know, good.  I'm ready to go see him again.  Like they said, he wrote Ohio the day after that fucking shit happened.  Like, he's that kind of dude after Kent State. 
[03:05:00]  But, I mean, okay, I understand that, but let's look on the other side.  How can he make new hits if you won't let him?  It's a balance.  It's a balancing act.  You know what you got to do?  You got to put an album out and let it, like, kind of pick up some steam.  Percolate.  True.  Let people listen to it and go like, oh, I like this song.  I like that.  So then when you see him live, you're like, oh, I like this song.  Yeah, but if you have enough hits in a set and then you're throwing in some of the new  stuff that you think will work, that's fine. 
[03:05:30]  I like that.  That's what happened.  I'll give you a prime example.  First album, well, the first, like, big hit album that Disturbed put out was, like, every  song on it I fucking loved.  That album still is worth putting in every once in a while.  So when I saw him live, it was like, oh, this is fantastic.  Everything's a hit.  But then the second album, I'm like, eh.  There was a couple of hits on it.  Yeah, not really.  It was nothing like the first one.  Yeah.  All right, how many hit songs do you have to have to have a full-fledged concert? 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  Apparently, one, if you're Kajagoogoo.  You go out and you just go, oh, man.  Modern English.  Because I don't know.  What's another Eagles hit?  One hit wonders.  Eagles got a lot of fucking Eagles.  Give me another one.  See, but that's what I'm saying.  I still have my white guy.  I still have my learning to do.  Eagles got a fuckload of hits.  Hotel California is, like, giant.  Well, I mean, no.  Other than Hotel California.  I think Eagles is a bad example, to be honest with the truth.  Desperado. 
[03:06:30]  As far as the white world goes, Eagles have just a million hits.  Now, see, I have a show that soon will be introduced to the world called Patrice O'Neill,  White People 101.  You should be hosting it.  And the inception of it is basically one day I was listening to some white dudes talk,  and I poked my nose in and said some ignorant, not knowing white people shit.  I go, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  One of the best guitarists I've ever heard was Hotel California by the Eagles.  They looked at me like I said, Will Smith getting jiggy with it was the best rap song.  Like if a white guy goes, hey, black guys, Young MC's a hell of a rapper, right?  That's how they looked at me.  And the show is going to be me taking a journey to teach myself and black people white people shit.  Right.  To say this is truly, like, when you say this to a white person, this is an insult to this.  This is the reaction you're going to get. 
[03:07:30]  It's like, who is this Neil Young fella?  I've never heard of him.  Who's this Neil Young fella who's, like, saying to a hip-hop guy, who's these Mobb Deep guys?  Who's these guys?  And you just go, really, I'm going to explain Mobb Deep to you, you piece of shit.  Now, same thing with the Eagles.  Now, I'm trying to get up on my, like, I'm trying to learn more than Leonard Skinner, more than just the hits.  Yeah.  The Eagles have so many hits that I think they had at least three, maybe four greatest hits albums. 
[03:08:00]  Greatest hits albums?  They just started long-run, heartache tonight.  Well, you know what I learned about white music?  I got introduced to classic white music from old wrestling.  Really?  Old wrestling, before they invented their own tunes, had all rock and roll hits.  That's true.  Black Sabbath, it was, uh, uh, uh, Roll Warriors used to come out to, uh, uh, Iron Man.  And it was perfect for them.  And another song by Rush called, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Monday War is a me-me. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was, that was, uh, Kerry Von Erich.  And Free Bird was fucking Leonard Skinner, but I learned all that shit from wrestling, man.  Blind Light, Spirit of the Radio, now I don't, I forget what song that is.  Blind Light.  That's, that's Rush, that's my, that's called, um, Tom Sawyer.  Tom Sawyer, thank you, yes, you're right.  So.  Yes, there it is.  I'm just saying, I just, I learned these songs, and then I got into the, and you know, 
[03:09:00]  you never know when you get introduced to, to, to white things, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got, and someone else.  You're very knowledgeable as far as the white man goes, though.  Very interesting.  Well, notice that.  Can we go to Tony in Florida, because, uh, Tony has a take on this.  Go ahead, Tony.  Hey, uh, hey guys, you know, if, if you wanted to, if you wanted to listen to a group, and  you wanted to hear their greatest stuff, they're popping a CD.  If you want to go listen to them in concert, you know, these musicians are getting tired  playing song from note to note. 
[03:09:30]  I mean, they want to, they want to bring something different.  And also, if they're, if they're touring an album, they want to, they want to play parts  of the song from the album.  They don't want to make an album and then play the old stuff.  What's the sense of going to see a band if they're touring an album, uh, like, uh, you  know, when all of a sudden you hear no songs from the album.  No one has this kind of opinion.  Tony, but it stinks.  That's funny, you're not allowed to have this opinion.  You can't.  I think you're, I think you're mixing, uh, uh, missing the point. 
[03:10:00]  I think what we just expect or want is just like a mix.  You, you, you definitely know they have to play their new stuff, even though it's unfamiliar  still.  But you definitely want.  You need time to go and grab that beer.  Just so you can, you want, so you can feel a part of it and sing along.  But you want, you definitely want the hits from, uh, your favorite band.  And that's one of the temptations.  And it didn't sing like, you know, I don't, I don't just sing, you go, what the fuck?  The whole tempo of the song.  And that's no good.  Cause it's like, oh, what song did they play? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, that was Purple Rain.  Oh, I didn't even know what, one line from it.  And I, I agree with Patrice, but if you're going to play the song, don't change the whole  thing.  Just change a little bit of it to know that, Hey, this is.  Nah, not a little bit of it.  All right.  Nope.  It's got to sound exactly right.  I don't want him to say fucking, I don't want to add one doobie scooby.  I don't want a doobie scooby.  You don't want one?  If I saw Jimi Hendrix, he said, all along, all along.  The Watchtower.  I'd be like, motherfucker, there's one along.  Yeah.  And I don't want the mic.  I don't want the mic going out to the audience when, when a part of the song comes up. 
[03:11:00]  I pay to hear you sing it, not us.  I can sing this on the car on the way home.  You sing the fucking song.  Hey, Richie's got a really good point.  I hate to admit, but go ahead, Richie.  Hey, Hope, nice job in having a black guy help you out with a Rush title.  Yeah.  And more than once, I've said how big of a Rush fan I am.  Division, man.  Divisiveness.  But he's right, though.  I should have told you it was Tom Sawyer.  Yeah, but there you go.  That's me.  I love, Richie. 
[03:11:30]  I love, you know, look, wrestling brought me, because Michael Hayes used to come out to Freebird.  When I used to hear, and then I listened to the song, and it's fucking a genius song.  It's like, hey, look, bitch, you know, it's that kind of song.  But another fucking white song that I listened to, because I love all white music, all old, not all, but old.  I'm not a big metal rock band guy, but fucking, you know that song, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Then they change it to like a thing where you lose the game. 
[03:12:00]  It's about a guy who fucking steals another guy's girl and tells the bitch, hey, let's go, bitch.  You kiss this motherfucker one last time before we bounce.  Kiss him goodbye.  I never knew that.  But we turned it into.  It's a sports anthem.  And fucking, if you like pina coladas, it's a fucking guy cheating on his goddamn wife.  Yeah.  And she's cheating on him.  And she's cheating on him, too.  And they catch each other cheating on you.  I'm like, but all we know is if you like pina coladas, yeah, get your dick sucked in a corner behind your girl's fucking back. 
[03:12:30]  But couples will sing it together because they have no idea.  They have no clue what the fuck that is.  So some of those back in the day, man, I was writing some of those classic rock songs.  Free Bird is a beautiful song, man, even though it's done by, you know, questionable.  Fucking bunch of racists.  Fucking Skinner, man.  Southern boys, yeah.  I love Zeppelin. 
[03:13:00]  Zeppelin might be my favorite white band ever.  I'd say.  What songs?  Well, Beatles might be.  What songs by Zeppelin?  Cashmere.  Oh, yeah.  And then Cashmere is a great song, but then it's like Stay Away to Heaven.  But Black Dog is one of my favorite little rock songs.  Black Dog is...  I'm a big fan of that shit.  You know why I like Zeppelin?  They ripped off the black band.  Did they?  Oh, boy, did they.  Oh, my God, did they ever.  And that's another thing. 
[03:13:30]  Go get the CD.  I hate not having to like white people because they steal from us all.  Go get the CD.  We'll teach you something about Zeppelin.  They fucking...  They stole from us?  Well, blatant.  And y'all admitting it?  Well, there was...  This can't be good.  There was a time that...  There was a time in music.  It was just accepted.  And then, you know, the table's turned a little bit and it's not anymore.  But, yeah, they would just take old fucking bluesmen songs and riffs and go with it. 
[03:14:00]  It's so fucking blatant ripoff.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  Really?  Yeah.  They didn't even try to cover it up.  This is the horrible thing about history.  When you just start...  Everything is shitty when you learn history.  Everything is...  Where you can't just go, boy, do I like Black Dog.  Nah.  They stole it from Blind Melon Jammer from 1602.  A black slave.  They cut his fingers off.  They cut his fingers off and played the guitar with Blind Melon Jammer's black finger. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  Ready for this?  We start with, you know, Willie Dixon, right?  Old bluesman.  Bluesman.  Willie Dixon.  See, this is...  Play the blues.  I'm a sellout.  But if any black people get to me, I don't know who the fuck Willie Dixon is.  I know who the fuck Willie Dixon is.  I know who the fuck Willie Dixon is.  The father of Jesse Dixon.  He's the boy.  Listen to this.  David Six on the floor with my mother.  Listen to this.  Hit him with a coser blade.  Baby, way down inside, woman, you need love. 
[03:15:00]  Way down.  Honey.  See?  See?  That's a little...  Safe to say Willie Dixon came before.  Poor motherfucking Willie Dixon.  And I don't think Willie Dixon has a fucking castle somewhere in Scotland.  No, I don't think they were paying Willie Dixon anything.  And that fucking...  See?  Here's all you gotta do to make this.  Because I did something when you guys let me host your show when you was gone.  It's the unsung songs of hip-hop. 
[03:15:30]  Where I go, this is the original song and this is the hip-hop song.  Yeah.  All I ask for anybody, including Led Zeppelin, which is too late.  Yeah.  Just in there, Joe.  Thank you, Willie Dixon.  Appreciate your song, baby.  Just a little drop.  So I don't...  Now it brings them down a little because I know them and I don't know poor Willie Dixon.  It's just like Big Mama Thornton singing, You Ain't Nothin' But A Hound, though.  You ready?  Yeah, yeah.  You ready for the next one?  All right. 
[03:16:00]  What's this one?  A couple more samples.  Oh, I can't quit you, baby.  It's Willie Dixon.  Oh, man, I've got to put you down for a little while.  Oh, I can't quit you, baby.  Oh, no.  So I'm gonna put you down.  Oh, no. 
[03:16:30]  He didn't even change the words in that one.  He just fucked Willie Dixon in the ass.  Oh, Jesus.  And what was the meeting?  Robert Plant, what was the meeting, Bonham?  What was the meeting?  Hey, you hear this nigga Willie Dixon?  Yeah.  Hey, man, you wanna...  I bet he didn't even say that.  I bet he just wrote shit down and went like, hey, I just wrote a song last night.  And they all went, oh, this is cool.  But okay.  All right.  Find the album.  Please do me a favor.  Yeah.  Find the album, please, and see if Willie Dixon is credited. 
[03:17:00]  That was a thing, too, because I think it took some lawsuits and stuff to get any kind  of writing credits on there.  So I think maybe it might have been changed now, but definitely when it was released, there  was no credit.  So we just thought that fucking Led Zeppelin was an amazing white band with his soul.  And it's Willie Dixon.  Willie Dixon.  Hey, that made my fucking asshole start itching.  And I gotta go home and fucking Google Willie Dixon now. 
[03:17:30]  And anytime somebody says fucking Led Zeppelin, I say, ah, blow me.  But that's like, you know what?  Fucking Quentin Tarantino drops in a couple of thises and that.  Fucking, I was watching Pelham 123.  He completely stole Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, Mr. This and That from Reservoir Dogs from Pelham  123.  Really?  Yep.  I didn't know that.  The original, yeah.  The original?  Did you know that?  Yeah.  Huh.  Robert Shaw, Mr. Blue, Mr. Pink.  And he had the whole thing where you don't, don't say your real name. 
[03:18:00]  You don't use the names.  We're gonna go.  It was Reservoir Dogs, man.  Yeah.  Fucking Reservoir Dogs.  I think he's acknowledged that homage.  I don't know.  Yeah?  That's because that's a blatant fucking ripoff.  I didn't fucking know.  Like, I've never, he's never, I've never heard him go fucking, you know.  It's just, I don't mind it because Quentin Tarantino made it 10,000 times more popular,  but at least give it that thing.  Like, these fuckers, now I gotta go listen to Willie Dixon, like, cause the original song 
[03:18:30]  to, uh, You Got What I Need, that, uh, Biz Markie made famous, you, you, you got what  I need, it's, it's by a guy named, um, That's a ripoff?  Dude.  Oh, yeah.  If you can find the original, um, Oh, baby, you, you got what I need.  I kind of, you know what?  You got everything I need.  Yeah.  You mean everything.  Freddie, um.  Um, Oh, baby.  But that's what he turned it into. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  He made it his own.  The original song was fucking, it's a, it's a beautiful song, uh, Freddie, please, if  you, if you could, man.  But, um, I'm, I didn't know, see, now this Led Zeppelin thing, it wasn't just a lick.  They stole a fucking song.  Yeah.  Word for word, basically.  Just don't tell me Jimi Hendrix stole from nobody.  That's all I, you know.  Well.  Just, please.  Don't, just tell me, don't tell me that.  He probably borrowed from someone that came before him.  Is there any one that was happening in music a lot?  I just want to hear another one. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, Travis, you got, uh, Howling Wolf, Killing Floor.  Yeah, another Led Zeppelin.  Is Cashmere stolen, too?  Oh, wait, no, go with, uh, another Willie Dixon.  Bring It On Home.  Oh, man, this is crazy.  Yeah, Willie Dixon was the big one.  If you got Bring It On Home.  No, I don't have that.  Was Willie Dixon going, oh, baby, just let the sun be down upon my face.  Poor Willie.  And I'm buying a stairway to heaven.  Do, do, do, do, do. 
[03:20:00]  I saw some stairs.  Do, do, do, do, do.  And they wasn't in hell.  Do, do, do, do.  You love Stairway to Heaven?  E-Rock, you didn't give me the Stairway to Heaven.  Willie Dixon?  Uh, no.  Another band.  It was, uh, Spirit, right?  Yeah, Spirit.  A little-known band, Spirit.  They had one, maybe two hits.  Fucking Led Zeppelin with Hacks?  They got fucking-  They ripped off Stairway to Heaven, their biggest hit.  The biggest rock song of all time, someone would argue. 
[03:20:30]  When did they get exposed?  Years ago?  Uh, I don't know.  Led Zeppelin's Hacks?  And do people consider them Hacks?  Where's the-  Nah, they don't consider them Hacks.  A lot of people just don't, uh-  Watch this.  Oh, look at this.  Here we go.  Wait till you hear this.  Uh, D.D.  Hi, thank you, sir.  Yep.  So you got, uh, Spirit came out with a song in 1968 called-  This is insane.  Called Taurus.  No one heard it.  No one knows this fucking song.  No one knows this song.  For real. 
[03:21:00]  So listen to Taurus from 1968.  And then, of course, a mere three years later, three years. 
[03:21:30]  It's close enough.  I mean, come on.  All the nigga did was add a G.  Oh, my God.  You got to be fucking kidding me, dude.  Hacks.  You know what?  I didn't-  This is fucking a rip-off motherfucker.  Led Zeppelin a Hacks?  Yeah.  I grew up on Zeppelin.  I didn't know half this shit.  Rip-off motherfuckers.  Especially the Spirit one.  I had no fucking idea.  They're fucking Hacks? 
[03:22:00]  That's a good one.  Oh, is that a good one?  See, this is my job to expose this kind of stuff.  Yeah.  Because it seems like white people just let this go.  Mm-hmm.  We don't care where it came from.  Like, it sounds good.  Fuck, I don't care.  Why not?  I've never heard a song where the original wasn't better.  Really?  I've never heard a song where they did-  Someone stole-  And then the original was not better.  That song-  I'm already like that riff, the first riff- 
[03:22:30]  In the first one.  Better than the fucking Stair With Heaven.  Let me think about that.  Original, always better.  There's gotta be one out there.  Shit.  Fucking criminals.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think-  Oh, by the way, the Twitter, remember?  Oh, right, right, right.  The porn.  And this one, I do believe one of our listeners turned me on to, and most people probably didn't  listen and would write it down, so I'm almost positive I got it from somebody as we were 
[03:23:00]  doing the radio show.  Simple.  Tweet me some skin.  That's all you need.  Tweet me some skin?  Really?  Tweet me some skin.  I thought Twitter was very non-  That's what I don't-  That's what I can't figure out.  Are you allowed to post some of these crazier pictures or not?  I don't know.  Moan.  And you just-  It's just at tweet me some skin.  And girls just will do a little sexting and set it into this guy.  And you follow. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, and you click on the links.  I really thought-  I barely swear on Twitter thinking that they're going to shut me down.  I get a little nervous.  You got that, Danny?  What's that?  Tweet me some skin.  Twitter.  What's that?  Well, I'm trying to get-  What's that?  What's that?  That's the Twitter name?  Yeah.  I hate when I get a bad gateway.  I don't even know what that is.  There you go.  And now let's just see what's up there right now.  Yeah, probably the third one down. 
[03:24:00]  What does it say?  What does that link say?  Hit that link.  The third one down.  Oh, you fucked up, Danny.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  See, now how do they post that on fucking Twitter?  There you go.  I thought that was not-  There you go.  That's what I don't understand.  Because something is illegal.  So the girls send their pictures to this guy, and then he posts them.  Damn.  All right.  Well, that's a thong.  For the most part, regular girls.  How many followers do you have?  He must have a million.  He doesn't have a lot.  No. 
[03:24:30]  Maybe he's trying to stay under the radar.  Well, we just blew up his fucking spot.  Jesus Christ.  Maybe he's trying to stay under the fucking spot of this guy's world.  You just fucked up this.  Oh, that's fucking hot right there.  I can't take credit for it.  Somebody turned me on to it.  I think it was a caller.  Suicide chick.  If you're out there, thanks.  I don't know.  I don't remember the name.  Coffee girl.  Yeah.  That's it.  I like that.  He's just, you know.  What a great idea.  Yeah.  Since we're talking about quick ideas, sports, but it's a sports guy.  You know, Carson Palmer, quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
[03:25:00]  His brother is the third string quarterback.  He has a website.  I thought it was amazing.  I saw it on that.  What's that shit?  They're on the same team?  Hard Knocks.  They're on the same team.  No clue.  But Jordan is, you know, borderline bum.  And he's average enough to be thinking about his future outside of football already.  And he's younger than his brother.  Right.  But he has a fucking website called runp.com.  And you know what it is? 
[03:25:30]  It's a movie database.  And he fucking tells you exactly.  He did research and they tell you exactly what moments in a movie that you're watching  where you can go take a piss.  Travis told us about that.  That's his?  Yeah.  That's Jordan Palmer.  That's like an app.  I think it's called Run P.  Run P.  Run P.  Here's Travis.  Here's Travis.  Travis told us about this a while ago.  That's Jordan Farmer.  Not Jordan Farmer.  Jordan Palmer. 
[03:26:00]  Carson Palmer's brother.  Now, do you have to sync up your iPhone or the iPhone will basically tell you?  No, it'll tell you.  Like?  Like here.  Like 500 days of summer.  Right.  You're sitting in 500 days of summer.  How do they know you're watching that particular 500 days of summer?  Well, they don't.  There's a whole list.  It's a database.  So you click on 500 days of summer.  And it says at 40 minutes into the movie, there's a queue that says Tom is laying in  bed and says to summer, I guess I'm not anybody.  At that point in time, it says you have five minutes to go to the bathroom and you're not 
[03:26:30]  going to miss anything.  And you don't have to come back.  You don't have to come back and say, what did I miss?  Because there's nothing that happened.  And then they'll tell you what you missed.  They give you a little plot summary.  But how?  That's fucking.  That's brilliant.  But how do you make money off that?  That's the key.  Because they charge you.  This is 99 cents.  Yeah, it's an app.  And it's this guy's app.  That's a great app.  That is a great app.  God damn.  Oh, by the way, what was that breaking news you sent me yesterday, Travis?  What?  About the iPhone and... 
[03:27:00]  Picture and video messaging.  September 25th.  September 25th.  What are they doing about cost?  Is that going to be extra?  It's included in your data plan.  It's included in the data plan.  Fucking A.  Finally.  Travis, you look disheveled.  He's a father now.  He's a father.  He's a father.  He's a father.  He's a baby.  He's a fucking wreck.  I have an A.  Recall baby.  What do you want?  He's a fucking wreck, Patrice.  You're not fucking forcing your wife to get up?  No.  No, she gets up.  She gets up to put the pants on in the family.  I don't know.  Face.  Face. 
[03:27:30]  He's just looking disheveled here.  I've never seen Travis look disheveled.  He really is.  You are a wreck as a dad.  Well, I don't know about that.  I think I'm a pretty good dad.  You love your baby yet?  You are good.  Of course.  When do you start actually loving him?  The second you see her.  I love his baby, too.  No, Danny.  She just got into her oral phase.  Oh, Jesus.  We were talking about not having a horrible baby joke about him.  Wait until she gets to the anal phase.  Oh, it's a girl?  Ay, caramba. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, Danny keeps threatening to fuck his daughter.  No, I'm going to finger his daughter.  Oh, okay.  I hate guys that act like they want daughters, too.  Like, who am I, little girl?  It's like, nobody wants a goddamn little future bleeder.  Have a beautiful baby.  Well, with guys, you're definitely going to be bailing it out of jail at some point.  You just showed the wrong person in this room a picture of your baby.  Why should I think Patrice thinks the baby's cute?  Eh, you know.  I'll show you a picture of my dog.  I'll tell you, white babies need a couple of years to finish cooking. 
[03:28:30]  Like, white babies are gross-looking.  They really do come out as slimy little things.  Blue veins, they just look like.  Get rid of that blue tint.  They look like the inside of a real baby.  So give it two years when it starts.  Because Voss' baby, I looked at it and went.
