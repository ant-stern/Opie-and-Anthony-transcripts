<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Anthony's accidental, 24-minute (or longer) on-air nap around 10:30 PM during the XM portion of the show.  This nap, captured live on camera and subsequently uploaded to YouTube and the show's website, caused quite a stir amongst Paltalk viewers, some of whom initially thought it was a looped video.  Soft music was played by the staff during the sleep.  The show also featured guest host Louis C.K., filling in for Jim Norton, who was appearing on Jay Leno.

The hosts then delved into their various sports curses, specifically Opie's uncanny ability to jinx any team he supports, leading to a discussion about the poor performance of the Phillies and Cubs.  Other sports-related conversations included George Steinbrenner's management style and a bizarre anecdote about an unusually large number of insects on a Yankees baseball field.  Opie also shared a story about his mother being hungover at a school field trip.  A caller, "Sam," hilariously demonstrated a profound lack of knowledge about football rules despite claiming to be a fan.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing critique of Reverend Al Sharpton's demand for an apology from Knicks coach Isaiah Thomas following an $11.5 million sexual harassment settlement. The hosts found Sharpton's position hypocritical and absurd, creating a satirical song about him and engaging callers in a debate about workplace harassment, the high cost of settlements, and the definition of a hostile work environment.  A caller shared a story about a co-worker's inappropriate sexual behavior.  The hosts also engaged in a lengthy discussion about humanity's place in the natural world, touching upon potential extinction and the possibility that humans are inherently out of place on Earth.

A "Pot Talk Monday" segment followed, exploring which species is second to humans in dominance.  Candidates included deer, dolphins, seals, killer whales, bears, turtles, beavers, bees, and ants (with a detailed discussion of ant society).  Humorous tangents included underwater civilizations, animal TV networks, and the hypothetical ant's reaction to human footsteps.  A caller's argument for veterinarians as proof of human supremacy was also considered.

This segued into "Feel Good Story Monday," which ironically began with a Disney World employee arrested for attempting to solicit a minor.  Attempts to find genuinely uplifting news repeatedly failed, leading to discussions of disabled cheerleaders (with offensive language used by the hosts), and a teenager injured by a police dog, prompting repeated comedic readings of "along with his scrotum."  Technical difficulties plagued this segment, with malfunctioning cameras, Paltalk issues, and the accidental display of only a leather chair and the Ron and Fez carpet.  The attempted feel-good stories included a hit-and-run victim's stolen groceries, a toddler forced into theft by her mother, two women affected by a medical lab error resulting in unnecessary surgeries (one a double mastectomy), and a senior citizen shooting a police officer after stealing candy.  A "wrestling match" between callers "Cromwell" and "Poe" ensued, with Cromwell lasting the full 30 seconds and Poe sustaining a head injury.  Louis C.K. was present in the studio during this segment.  Throughout the broadcast, Louis C.K.'s presence led to several anecdotes, including a story about a conversation with his daughter about thunderstorms and his reactions to the show's content. The show also addressed technical difficulties with the equipment and software.

The broadcast continued with an anecdote about a lost condom, followed by a discussion, using crude and sexually explicit language, of an 82-year-old woman marrying a 24-year-old man.  This led to a conversation about people being kicked off airplanes for inappropriate attire, including discussions of revealing clothing and a t-shirt with a masturbation joke. The etymology of "masturbator" was debated.  Audio clips were played, including prank calls involving "butt plug" and informing a mother that her daughter was working in pornography.  The hosts discussed the evolving legal landscape of prank calls. The show concluded with the "line of the day,"  promotion for Steven Esmer-Bayshore, the show's new rundown writer,  promotion for Louis C.K.'s upcoming performance, Jimmy's appearance on the Tonight Show, and the show's website.  The broadcast ended with ongoing audio issues and a brief discussion about the "walkover" segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shot shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot shots, Opie and Anthony.  Testing, 1, 2, 1, 2.  Po, Po, Bubo, Banana, Nana.  Banana, Fana, Fo, Fo.  Fi, Fi, Mo, Mo.  Po!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff, and they just threw them in a dumpster and lunged it. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny, and no one wants to get rock stars.  Is this where entertainment is going?  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one,  to feel his manhand holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm sorry.  Billy.  So sorry.  Billy.  That I was such a fool.  I'm sorry, Billy.  I didn't know.  I thought I did.  A lot could be so cruel.  So cruel. 
[00:02:00]  Hi, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I don't even think we should be broadcasting today.  I think it's one of those days that you can take off and no one will notice.  Columbus Day.  Yeah.  It's for all us Italians.  For some reason, it's an Italian.  Take it off.  Yeah.  A lot of the banks are closed.  But then the stock market's open.  And then it's one of those holidays that didn't quite get everybody to get. 
[00:02:30]  It's like Martin Luther King Day, you know.  Same thing.  Ah, we'll stay open.  Ah, some of us will close.  Traffic was nice, though, coming in.  Yeah, that means we're not broadcasting to anybody.  I know.  Exactly.  Why waste this material when no one's listening?  It's good quality stuff.  I'd say we called it in today.  Well, first off, it's good to see Anthony awake.  Yeah.  Yeah, good to... 
[00:03:00]  Wow, how are you guys doing?  Pretty good, Anthony.  I haven't seen you since, I think, Wednesday.  Louis C.K. in for Jimmy.  Jimmy's going to be on Jay Leno tonight.  Let's not forget, let's all take a peek at that tonight.  Yes.  And we got Louis C.K. sitting in for Jim Norton.  Good morning, guys.  Always a pleasure.  And Louis has no idea what I mean by saying it's good to see Anthony awake.  No, I don't.  What happened?  Anthony fell asleep.  It's the first time in my radio career.  Really?  Like during the show, you mean?  During the show.  Oh, my God.  On the XM side. 
[00:03:30]  It was about 10.30-ish, I guess.  Tried to make it to 11.  Oh, my God.  Wasn't going to happen.  You fell asleep in your seat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  There's the picture right there.  There it is.  And the video's up on YouTube.  Believe me, it's all over.  I've seen all the pictures and video.  Here's what happened.  Here's my sorry excuse, but this is exactly how it went down.  I had Thursday.  I had made plans to go out to go karaoke-ing Thursday night. 
[00:04:00]  Now, a weeknight, it's very difficult for us to go out on a weeknight because we got a show to do.  Let it be known, though, that when he said that he's doing karaoke on Thursday night, Jimmy and I both at the same time went, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Now, I made a contingency plan.  Is that something you do a lot?  No.  That's just it.  No.  On weekends, if somebody's hanging out and wants to do that, that's fine. 
[00:04:30]  But I figured, you know, everyone's going out.  It's a Thursday.  I know that's treacherous because we have to get up very early.  So instead of just saying, yeah, and going out and then trying to go back to Long Island and everything, I had a plan.  Here was my plan.  I was going to stay in town, which I did.  I booked a hotel room.  I left the show at about a quarter after 11, like right after the show ended, I was out of here, in the bed, in the hotel, and asleep. 
[00:05:00]  I slept until about 4.30 from about 11.30.  So I figured, all right, here.  Now, my plan's working.  I slept.  I have a hotel in New York City, so I can go to karaoke and then go back to the hotel, which is, I mean, right near the studio.  So I don't have to commute in.  I really thought it out.  It's a big commitment to karaoke.  It's a big commitment to karaoke.  It's a big commitment to living like a human being for one night. 
[00:05:30]  I just wanted to be a person again.  It's not that he's that big of a fan of karaoke.  It could have been anything.  It could have been a late night poker game.  When you're not here, you're working on your karaoke career.  And to tell you the truth, a couple of weeks back, I got an invitation to go on a Sunday night to Kevin Smith's comic book shop to play poker.  It's like an all-night poker thing. 
[00:06:00]  And he came in directly from that poker game without any sleep.  And I was thinking I could do the same thing.  I'll sleep.  I'll do this.  And then I thought better of it and thought, you know something, I'll just be a wreck.  Forget about it.  But this just struck me as, it's local.  I slept.  I can do this.  And got through this portion of the show, the FM radio portion of the show.  The more important part.  Exactly.  That's what Logan wants to hear.  Far more people than me.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:06:30]  Well, of course.  I know that.  As long as you get through that.  Long shot.  And then I go over.  Actual advertising being sold.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  Money being made.  Yeah.  I go over to.  How do you not phone in XM?  It's a subscription.  You've got their money.  They actually tell you how many people are listening on this side.  Yeah.  On the XM side, it's this vague math thing.  Very vague.  No way to know.  This, your career rests on how many people are listening.  Over there.  If you suck on XM, it'll trickle down to your actual show in like a year. 
[00:07:00]  It'll take.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They might start thinking, hey, they're making a message for a while.  I'm just.  What are you doing over there?  I'm just very suspicious of the whole XM thing because they say we're doing amazing.  They say we're one of the most listened to channels on the whole platform.  And I'm like, well, that's great.  Why don't we send that out to the media?  That would help our show.  But we can't release those numbers.  But for some reason, they can't release numbers that say that you're doing really well,  which makes me very suspicious of what the hell's going on over there. 
[00:07:30]  A little suspect.  I don't think they know what anybody's listening to or watching.  Pull numbers out of a hat.  But how do they not know what people on the subscription are?  How do they know?  Because airwave seems impossible.  You can't figure it.  But you know, like on XM, a few times that my subscriptions run out because I'm stupid,  I call and then they go, so it's back on now, right?  Like the lady on the phone knows what I'm listening to.  Yeah, yeah.  So they should be able to know.  They should.  I'm happy to know what some guy, some security guard is listening to on a little radio. 
[00:08:00]  It's a top secret thing.  We don't know.  They won't tell us.  So anyway, back to airwave.  Oh, yeah.  So we get over to the XM side and I'm holding it together, really tired, feeling it, holding  it together.  And then around 1030 or so in the home stretch.  It was before that.  Oh, no.  Well, I like looked at the time.  I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  I have no idea.  You were dozing way before 1030.  I was dozing.  Look, we were having a boring show on Friday for the XMers.  But yeah, but we were trying our best.  Well, we had Drew from FARC came in.  Who was interesting to about 1% of our audience.  Yeah, from FARC.com.  I don't know what that is.  He came in.  He's got a book.  Yeah, it's a website that has a list of stories that are happening.  Good friend of the show.  Yeah.  Could be a little long-winded at times.  Yeah, just a tad.  And then, so here was the kiss of death. 
[00:09:00]  The new studio over there is amazing.  It's huge.  And the seats are so comfortable that I decided to turn sideways and put my feet up on the  console and bring the mic over to me.  Now, that was the wrong thing to do.  Yeah, forget it.  Now, Francine, the lovely Francine, starts babbling about something. 
[00:09:30]  There were a lot of people in the studio, so they were talking to her.  She's talking to them.  I didn't really have much input like I usually do because there's a full studio.  So I'm going.  I'm nodding.  I'm gone.  It's like reclining your seat when you're driving a Cadillac.  Yeah, you just don't do that.  Turn the heat up.  If there was a way to open the windows of the studio and stick my head out the window  and smack myself, turn my headphones up real loud, that's what I should have done. 
[00:10:00]  No, it's like when you're driving and you realize you're not trying to stay awake anymore.  You're actually trying to go to sleep.  You're trying to go to sleep.  I've been in that situation.  Heat on.  Yeah, sit back.  They kind of hunch back.  Yeah.  Find an easy listening station on the radio.  One eye shut.  Put your hand on the bottom part of the steering wheel.  Just rest it.  Yeah, rest your arms.  So the blood doesn't have to go.  I just want to die.  I want to die in a horrific high-speed crash. 
[00:10:30]  One of the many pictures that are being released today.  Are these pictures up on the website yet?  That's a good one.  That's my feet kicked up.  No, it's funny.  These pictures weren't on the website for everybody to see over the weekend  because everyone around here was kind of scared behind the scenes.  I don't know.  Wow.  But now it's official.  You could put those pictures wherever they want.  Oh, yeah.  There's Anthony.  Yeah, put him up.  Completely out cold.  And then somebody thought it was hysterical to get the PalTalk camera  and zoom right in on me sleeping.  So that was on there for, I have no idea how long. 
[00:11:00]  Me and Than were in cahoots.  Yeah, no, I assumed it was Than because he's a master of the control also.  I'm giving Than all these hand signals, and he goes over there.  And he's actually reaching over your body in such a way not to disturb you.  I was out.  Because at that point, we're like, we smell bit.  We got to do something with this, right?  You have to.  You can't let a guy like that alone.  No.  I thought they were going to write like, you know, D, I, on my head.  Put one next to your face.  Yeah, I thought Jimmy Norton was going to, you know, do one of those. 
[00:11:30]  We had a whole list of things we were thinking of doing.  Do you do anything weird when you sleep?  But no, I just pretty much laid there and slept.  But then when I woke up.  Forty minutes later.  I kind of like woke up, and I'm on the PalTalk camera,  and I look around like I had no idea where I was, what was going on.  And then it hit me.  I'm like, oh, man, everyone's gone.  They just, they left me there with classical music playing. 
[00:12:00]  Louie, I went on mic, and I was like, all right, Anthony's asleep.  He's going to wake up any time between now and noon.  And you had your headsets on, too.  Yeah.  So I had to talk really soft.  I'm like, we're going to put music on in the background.  His mic is going to be live.  Oh, my God.  And between now and hopefully noon, he will wake up.  And then we all just left the studio.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Like, just breathing.  How late?  When did you wake up?  I woke up at, it was just a little after 11. 
[00:12:30]  We have the audio of him waking up.  We need that today.  See, I don't like falling asleep in front of people.  It makes me nervous.  I don't like it.  I lived with Nick, Nick DiPaolo, and I were roommates for a while.  And he said at one time when I was really fast asleep,  I farted several times, and I started yelling the N-word in my sleep.  Get at me.  Yeah.  And after he told me that I couldn't fall asleep on an airplane ever.  Yeah, because what are you going to do?  You're going to start blurting inappropriate things out.  And now you're paranoid of falling asleep in public, right? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I don't want to fall asleep anywhere.  So the first thing I did, once I realized where I was, was turn off the PalTalk camera,  because I was annoyed that that was pointing at me, and it was in close-up.  And then for some reason, I didn't know what was going on still,  and the guys had me do a read.  They had me do a read for a sponsor.  Well, they paid good money, and they needed to get their, you know, their read it.  And I screwed it up, and I'm like, all right, let's effing do this again. 
[00:13:30]  I was just a mess.  Look, there's the picture from PalTalk of him waking up.  The middle picture is creepy.  Yeah, I just got my eyes open wide.  I'm like, you look like a ghost or something.  Where am I?  And then by the third picture, you look like the Anthony we all know.  And I'm kind of laughing, like, oh, no, I am so screwed.  Oh, my God.  But it was just a mistake trying to stay awake and go out Thursday night. 
[00:14:00]  Just wasn't going to happen.  And the video of him actually sleeping is up on YouTube right now.  So far, there's two or three versions up there.  I don't like any of them yet.  But one guy did, what was the song they threw behind him?  The Lion Sleeps Tonight.  Right, right.  Oh, great.  Right.  It's a YouTube video of actually seeing Anthony breathing.  His chest is going up and down.  You kind of hear him.  Well, you don't really hear him because they drowned it out with Lion Sleeps Tonight.  Yeah.  They made their own version of Anthony sleeping.  And I'm not really a snorer. 
[00:14:30]  No.  Well, people on Instant Feedback, Ed, hope you got enough sleep this weekend.  And Opie, you could go to hell with your dumb sports curse.  Bill from Waterford.  Good morning, Opie.  Yo.  What a wonderful morning to be awake.  Is your cohort Anthony awake or is he sleeping on the job again?  Ant's not living this one down for a while.  And then he writes, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  I caught hell.  CokeLogic just writes Z a lot.  A lot of Zs.  And, you know, the listeners will write Z on Instant Feedback when they're just bored with us. 
[00:15:00]  But in this case, CokeLogic wrote Z and then he writes, I'm not bored.  I'm just imitating Ant.  B-ha-ha-ha-ha.  He actually spelled out B-ha-ha-ha.  A-ba-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Yeah.  And then Ryan from Louisiana, new bit, wake up the co-host Friday.  So embarrassing.  I tried being a human being and going out and just it didn't work.  Yeah.  It didn't work.  And it really ruined the entire weekend because then my sleep was really screwed up. 
[00:15:30]  And I couldn't get back in sync over the weekend.  Sleep is the thing you got to trade in for real life.  That's what I do, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Because my kids will wake me up at 6 or 7.  So if I want to do anything, if I do sets at night or whatever, I'm like, I just won't sleep.  It won't happen.  I don't know how Jimmy does it.  I don't know how Norton does it either.  He's like, I was up doing sets and I got home at like 1230. 
[00:16:00]  I'm like, 1230?  Yeah.  Wake up at 4.  I'm snoozing by 1230.  Louie makes a good point because, you know, from time to time, I'll go, Kenny, why won't you have a drink with us?  He goes, I don't drink anymore.  And I go, why don't you drink anymore?  I'm thinking there's some horrific story with a hooker involved or something.  Some DW, you know, a DW back in his day.  He goes, kids don't understand hangovers.  Yeah.  They don't care.  So, like, you know, he learned when his kids were growing up that they don't understand that daddy's hungover and only had two or three hours sleep. 
[00:16:30]  And that's when he quit drinking.  Kids don't wake up like, ugh.  They just wake up.  They're, you know, zero.  Yay.  They just wake up.  They're ready to roll.  And Kenny, I'd like to tell Kenny, kids do understand hangovers.  Yeah.  Wives don't understand hangovers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mothers don't understand hangovers.  I, I, I, if you, if you show kids enough of them, they'll know exactly what it is.  Believe me.  Growing up, I knew what a hangover was.  I knew what it was.  You know, leave me alone. 
[00:17:00]  Dad with the wet rag on his head.  Yeah.  Mom just miserable.  She went on a field trip with me.  She was a field mother.  Oh, my God.  One year.  Remember when you went on field trips as a kid?  And, like, it was kind of cool to have, like, the field mother was one of the moms.  And my mother was very pretty.  And I was very proud of my pretty mom because all the kids would talk about, like, what a pretty mommy you have.  I picture your mom on a field trip with hot pants on or something.  She did.  She was, like, wearing, like, white leather.  Leathered go-go boots and pigtails. 
[00:17:30]  And, like, just CT, the bus driver.  It was just a mess.  But the kids were just like, oh, my God, your mommy's so pretty.  And she came to a field trip once.  We were going to Radio City Music Hall to see some Charlie Brown movie that was premiering there.  Some crap.  And she was so hungover.  She, like, stunk a booze.  She's sitting in the bus.  And all I kept asking was, what's the matter, mommy? 
[00:18:00]  Do you feel good?  Because everybody wants to talk to you.  And what?  Well, she's like, oh, I don't feel good.  Oh, mommy doesn't feel good.  Oh, no.  She's pregnant again.  I think mommy's pregnant.  In the middle of the movie, I'm sitting there.  And she just gets up and bolts to the bathroom where I can only assume she booted the old Technicolor yawn.  Yeah, as little Anthony and his classmates are sitting watching the movie, I'm looking around waiting for mommy. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, hold on.  Where did mommy go?  She didn't even say she was going to the bathroom.  Boy, this is a long time for mommy to have to be in the bathroom.  And she's just booting.  Just blood coming out of her belly.  Yeah.  There you go.  Where's mommy?  Mommy, mommy, she's a field mother.  She's supposed to be here with us and the classmates.  You look so pretty.  And it was me and the empty seat and the classmates sitting around. 
[00:19:00]  And I had a little program for the movie that she bought me before we got in there.  And I'm just thumbing through it, like looking over, waiting for her to come back.  And she just wasn't coming back.  And when she came back, her tongue was pink because she was guzzling Pepto out of the bottle.  Oh, Jesus.  That rocks.  Yeah, that was my experience with the old field mother thing. 
[00:19:30]  And it was embarrassing.  And I understood a hangover.  Believe me, I knew what it was.  That was it.  I'm doing that on Wednesday.  I'm going with my kid.  To where?  Oh, you're doing a field trip?  Yeah.  I'm being a whatever.  Chaperone.  Dad, chaperone, they call him now.  Yeah, it was a field mother back then.  And I'll probably be the same way.  I'm not going to be awake.  Just hungover.  Telling sea jokes to the kids.  That's going to be me. 
[00:20:00]  Doing his material on the bus.  All right, we got to take our first break.  So good news.  Anthony's awake for the radio show today.  Pop is a pop.  Some videos of that on YouTube.  We'll put up some pictures up on our website.  Enjoy it.  Enjoy it and make fun of Anthony.  Goof on me.  We got lots to do today, man.  Lots to do.  Very, very busy sports weekend, obviously.  Yes.  Very important for the Yankees.  And we got to talk about Reverend Al.  He's got to just shut the F up. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Where's the coalition against Al?  Yeah.  I ate breakfast right next to him the other day at the Four Seasons.  Oh, at the Four Seasons.  What happened to the soul food place?  Yeah, no kidding.  I think he's there every morning.  Him and Larry Flint.  He wants people to boycott.  We'll talk about the Knicks until Isaiah Thomas apologizes.  We'll get into that.  Oh, the Knicks.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  You scared the hell out of me.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  And Steinbrenner saying some crazy stuff. 
[00:21:00]  Let's just take a quick break.  Yeah.  We'll do a little sports thing next.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony with Louis C.K. today.  Good morning, guys.  Philly.  So sorry.  Philly.  That I was such a fool.  I thought I knew.  I didn't know.  But I thought I did.  I thought I could be so cruel.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:21:30]  Unless you're listening in Cleveland, then.  Well, hey.  Good afternoon to you.  All right.  Good afternoon.  They hear us in the afternoons.  They do?  Yeah.  Our phone number is 877-212-O-N-A.  I don't know what to say to Philly today.  I really wanted the Phillies to win it all this year.  I really did.  And you've proven that.  Yes.  You really wanted them to win.  And that's why they completely self-destructed.  Don't go.  Well, Louis doesn't understand. 
[00:22:00]  We're trying to explain to him.  I haven't had one of my sports teams win since, I guess, the 1986 Mets.  Yeah.  So it's been 21 years since I've had a winner.  So, you know, when your team is losing and stuff, you kind of, you know, if you're a sports fan, you take a peek at other teams.  Yeah.  You know, you're not going to, you'll kind of be excited, but you want to root for something, right?  Yeah.  And everybody I pick loses.  Yeah.  And I'm not going for underdogs.  Yeah.  And he can't just.  It looks good.  And then all of a sudden they look like in the spring training when they play college teams. 
[00:22:30]  He can't just pick a team either.  He can't just take a team and like, I want this team to lose, so I'm going to root for him.  It's got to be sincere.  He's not even in control of it.  It's just he wanted Philly to win.  His fiance is from Philly.  We had a great time when we went to Philly.  We went to the game.  We got the tour.  The tour was beautiful.  We met some players.  We saw a tour of the entire park. 
[00:23:00]  It was fantastic.  They gave us beautiful seats.  We were on the field during batting practice.  And Ops could just go in like.  And half the Phillies were trying to pick up my chick.  You know, it was great.  And he's sitting there.  It's fun for everybody.  We're sitting there and Ops is like, you know, man, I could get used to coming here.  This is a nice park and everything.  Really nice.  And so, you know, when they make the playoffs and the Mets didn't, it was like, hey, root  for the Phillies.  Right, right.  It was a natural.  And people, you know, ask me all the time, pick a team. 
[00:23:30]  And I'll go, look, I don't really care about either one of those teams.  I'll even say that.  Like, I'm not just going to pick a team.  Yeah, because it doesn't work that way.  It's got to be something I'm feeling.  So this year I felt the Phillies, they got shut out.  I was feeling the Cubbies.  They got shut out.  Oh, this is all documented, too.  He said all this before they even threw out the first pitch for the playoffs.  For Louie, here we go.  Why don't you play that clip from last week, right?  Before the playoffs started.  Here you go.  So what do you think, Ops? 
[00:24:00]  Go Phillies!  Oh, no!  Go Phillies!  Oh, there it is!  There it is!  Go Phillies!  You aren't saying go Phillies.  Is this an official endorsement?  You are picking the Phillies.  I think it's their year.  To take it all the way.  I think it's their year.  It's their year.  Oh, no.  They had a hell of a year.  The curse gods are now...  All right, you heard it, guys.  Get to work.  Go Phillies!  Get to work.  It's not just a radio bit anymore.  No, it's creepy.  It's been happening for years.  It's so creepy, man.  Years. 
[00:24:30]  And then...  It is weird, because they were legitimately a good team.  Yeah.  And they sunk for three games in a row.  Yeah.  And then we had this, what, the following day?  Arizona is bizarrely, like, it's all rookies, and they've lost all their good players.  They just want to try hard.  Yeah.  So, this is what I said on Friday.  I was thinking that you were secretly rooting for the Yankees.  Like, this showed that somewhere deep inside, you were like, I kind of want the Yankees to win.  I wish it was true, Ant, because then the sports curse would be even better, but no. 
[00:25:00]  I picked the Phillies to go all the way and win the World Series.  I picked the Cubbies, because it's been a long time, and just feeling good about the Cubbies.  Yeah.  And, of course, you've got to go Red Sox.  Got to go Red Sox!  Sure.  And that's where, like, it's weird, because I have to go Red Sox over the Yankees.  So, there you go.  Well...  You know, if you add it up, I, you know, out of nine games, I won three games.  Yeah.  That's not bad.  It's not bad.  Not bad at all. 
[00:25:30]  You've completely destroyed, devastated two cities.  You're like an atomic bomb.  Weird, because I've been watching, I watched the Cubs and the Phillies games, and I'm like,  what's going on here?  Like, that's how it felt.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow, those two teams are having no...  It's like, what happened?  Yeah.  Because the Cubs could not do anything, and the Phillies couldn't, they just, they couldn't  even make it interesting.  No.  But they were clearly the better teams going in.  I want out of this sports curse badly.  Because I'm starting to get creeped out by it. 
[00:26:00]  I really am.  Like, my Islanders got knocked out last year in hockey, so I was like, I lived in Western  New York for over 10 years.  I want the Sabres.  They got their asses handed to them.  I mean, I lived in Buffalo when they lost all four Super Bowls.  I lived back home when the Giants lost the Super Bowl.  I lived in Boston when the Pats lost the Super Bowl.  I'm telling you, there's something going on.  It's a sports curse.  I don't know where it comes from.  Don't forget, my baseball team is the Mets, and they had one of the biggest collapses 
[00:26:30]  in baseball history.  Yeah, that was really bad.  Try getting interested in something besides sports.  Try something else.  Try picking hookers that you think will die of age.  And then it won't be a big tragedy.  You're like, oh, well.  It's probably worth it.  We got Philly Tyrant, he writes.  Hopefully, I'm the first person to say, F you and your sports curse, Opie.  And then we got Bert from Philly moving on with sports here.  Oh, my God.  Roger Clemens is sitting on an ice box.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[00:27:00]  He's pulled a hammy.  All that money.  Stinks.  He's sitting up in the box.  They took him out of the game, and the guys in the booth go, well, it's fitting that his  last batter was a strikeout to the great.  Because they're all ex-players.  Yeah, yeah.  The guys in the booth don't make any real comments because they're all ex-players, and  they all support.  Yeah, they don't really want to bad enough.  They should have been like, well, there ends the biggest farce in the history of sports.  Yeah, a huge payday for nothing. 
[00:27:30]  A massive waste of money.  When they signed Clemens, they didn't really sign him for the regular season.  They signed him for the playoffs.  Yeah, of course.  Playoffs, where he could come out, intimidate, and just be the pitcher he was a couple of years  What did he last, two innings last night?  Yeah.  Two and a third, something like that.  And just, you know, limps off.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Roger Clemens pitched two and a third innings.  Oh my God, look at the dugout.  Joe Torre wondering if he's going to have a goddamn job. 
[00:28:00]  Job!  25.  Didn't he pay him 25 million?  Clemens, yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey, I'm happy to be back, and yeah, it's great.  Big announcement.  We'll be seeing y'all soon.  We'll be seeing y'all soon.  I'll be having a 5.3 ERA soon.  I'll be going 8 and 10 soon.  Or whatever it was.  Goodness gracious. 
[00:28:30]  George Steinbrenner threatening Joe Torre with his job.  I read that this morning.  I'm like, I don't think that would be, like, a good motivation to basically come out and  go, look, if Joe Torre doesn't win at all this year, he's fired.  He ain't coming back next year.  Well, it kind of rallied the team, I think.  I think he's hoping it rallies the team around the skipper.  I think they decided, let's win one game, so he goes, and then they're just going to,  I think they're going to lose on purpose.  And then they're just going to say, screw this.  Screw Steinbrenner.  Because they hate him now. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, because if now they think they play for him.  Well, he pays the checks.  They don't get it.  If they had a miracle and they took two now, it would be like, you're doing it for George.  Who doesn't have their job on the line when things go wrong?  Yeah.  It's not like he, you know, geez.  Well, not Torrey.  It's not like he's been able to come back year after year after year.  He hasn't won anything in a long time now.  I just don't feel sorry for him or any of them.  And it's just, you know, they get paid a lot of money, and he's not Gene Autry or somebody. 
[00:29:30]  He's just a baseball manager.  Well, Steinbrenner.  Lose and take away the job.  Let him go home to his mansion.  One of our favorite Steinbrenner clips is after they won the World Series in, I guess, what, 2000?  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  I don't keep track of the Yankees' record.  Sorry.  I just.  But he was in the locker room just crying like he was a blubbering old man talking about how great his team was  and how great Joe Torrey is.  Joe Torrey.  Yeah.  He was talking about how the Yankees are the best team in baseball, and to, you know, get this trophy from you. 
[00:30:00]  And he was crying.  And this is like the guy that you think back to the old Billy Martin days and firing everybody.  He was just hell on wheels.  Yeah.  And there he is.  Like, he looked old.  He still had a stupid turtleneck on.  And he's just bawling, crying.  We're trying to find that clip of anyone, anyone out there.  One of our faithful listeners has it. 
[00:30:30]  We need it.  I think it was 98.  I think it was that.  Yeah, I think it was before 2000, dude.  Yeah.  They didn't win.  It was the year of 9-11.  They didn't win.  Wasn't that 2000 or was that 2001?  2001.  98 then?  Okay.  I think it was early that because he was so emotional because it was so, you know, new.  I think it was because 98 was that great year.  Yeah.  That they won way too many games.  And we thought he was old.  We thought he was old back then.  That's nine years ago.  Yeah.  He's really old.  Where it's like, Joe Torey, Joe Torey is going to be out of a goddamn job. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, I love you, Joe.  I don't want to fire you, but you got to win these games.  Millionaires age weirdly because they literally just pump money into their veins to keep it alive.  And everybody around them is just kind of keeping the head alive to keep their jobs.  Yeah.  Just to keep their jobs.  He dies.  A whole bunch of people lose their jobs and stuff.  So they're just keeping them barely cognizant. 
[00:31:30]  Just kind of prop them up.  Yeah.  For a couple of...  You don't even see him give an interview.  You read about it in the paper.  Yeah.  No, his face is really white.  Yeah.  He has, like, lipstick on now.  Yeah, he's wearing lipstick or something.  You're absolutely right.  He's real pale, and he's got these red lips, and his jowls always make him look sad.  He's melting a little bit.  Yeah.  He's got a little melting in his face going on.  He's melting in his blood.  Like, they replace his blood with some kind of, you know... 
[00:32:00]  Female estrogen?  Hercine or something.  I'm going to go with oil.  Some kind of oil.  Yeah.  Some base product.  Some kind of...  What do you call it?  Oil that, you know...  Oh, jeez.  My brain doesn't work this morning.  I think he's taking hormone shots.  Female hormone shots.  Really?  Because he gets all emotional now.  He didn't used to do that.  He'd get up there.  He was fast talking.  Yeah.  Like a smartass.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  And people feared him.  Tony Curtis.  I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of him recently.  Yeah.  He's a woman.  He's not looking good. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  No.  He's just a big, fat woman now.  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  You got his hamstring.  Why?  We paid good money.  I'm going to tell Joe his job is on the line, even though I love him.  He's the best coach in baseball.  A whining.  Speaking of the Indian...  Boss.  The Yankees and the Indians.  That bug game was just amazing, wasn't it?  Yeah.  What the hell was that about?  Did they explain that?  I have no idea, but it was like a swarm of locusts. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know what descended on them.  Baseball was just a large area.  That's why occasionally there's like...  It was just...  It's a field.  It was Nats.  You're in the field.  Yeah.  It was Nats or something.  Yeah.  And our guys put together all the headlines from that game.  They all...  And each one of these headlines, someone thought they were being clever.  Right, right.  And original.  Front page of the paper.  Stung.  They were Nats, first of all.  They were Nats.  They're just a nuisance.  Nothing stung anybody.  Back page.  Doom Buggy. 
[00:33:30]  Yanks on verge of elimination after loss to Pesty Tribe.  Tribe.  Yeah.  Joba Buggin.  Of course, Joba's one of their relief pitchers.  Yeah, but Joba Buggin?  Buggin, yeah.  Buggin.  Because, you know, a lot of bugs.  Bugs.  Bombers in O2 hole after bugging out.  Yanks victim of insecticide.  Now they're in a swarm of trouble.  Uh-oh. 
[00:34:00]  It goes on.  Of course it does.  Another paper with the front page saying, Swats Up.  Back page.  Buggin' out.  Reality bites for bombers.  Sudden swarm plagues Yanks.  A-Rod's October not happening.  Nat's happening.  Not happening.  Couldn't, like, the New York Post one day just blow everybody away by just having the headline  be, Yankees lose due to bugs on the field.  Yeah.  Right. 
[00:34:30]  Bugs.  Like, just.  And then the final one.  Andy Jem gets lost in the buzz.  So they were having fun with the bug game.  Can I just say one thing about old, disgusting Steinbrenner for a second?  Let's go back to that for a second.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Because I remember, I used to be a photographer, his assistant.  It was this Time Magazine photographer, and I went around with him.  That's kind of cool.  It was kind of a cool job.  And we took a picture of Ray Kroc, who invented McDonald's.  Sure.  And in front of a McDonald's just in Framingham somewhere on Route 9.  And he showed up, and he was just this. 
[00:35:00]  Miserable?  Miserable.  He was with a blonde in a fur coat, and he had big, weird growths all over his face.  Oh, no.  Like, his face was covered with little brown moles that stick out.  Burgers growing out of his face.  Yeah, like, literally looked like burgers.  You know those old people moles that are actually, like, two inches off the face?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were just all, his face was covered with these things.  That's what you get from eating burgers your whole life. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, and also just being alive too long.  Too long.  You know, and I just thought, God.  You end up like one of those old dogs no one wants to pet.  No.  You're so right, because I caddied for a living for many, many years, and it was a lot of older  guys.  And if you're alive for too long, stuff really starts happening to that body.  And there's something about millionaires that way, though, because you're like, couldn't  he do something?  Just go to the doctor and have those hacked off or something?  I used to caddy for a guy, he would wear his golf shirt, and you could see through the  golf shirt, these huge, I don't even know what they're called, goiters? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  They were as big as actual golf balls all over this guy's body.  Oh.  That you could see, even though he's wearing a shirt.  I'm like, what is going on with this guy?  That's right, man.  Yeah, no, that's why Steinbrenner has his turtleneck, like, from the neck down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God knows what's happening there.  Hey, by the way, speaking of the sports curse, Sergeant G from Iraq.  Oh, here's the sports curse.  My Mets, okay?  I'm a Mets fan. 
[00:36:30]  We haven't won since 86.  Islanders, everyone knows I'm a huge hockey fan.  Going today, by the way, to the game.  Islanders haven't won since 83.  You're still trying your strive for five?  Yeah, right.  Strive for five after a 15-year layoff.  That was a hell of a dynasty back then.  No kidding, man.  You got to really enjoy yourself back 30 years ago, whatever it was.  It got cocky, man.  Islanders since 83.  The Knicks, I'm a huge Knicks fan.  That hasn't happened since 1973. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Oof.  And the Jets, what?  What is that?  69?  70?  Right?  That was it for the Jets?  The 69 one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  With Joe Willie Nameth.  Yeah.  Broadway Joe.  Wow.  Guaranteeing the win.  Jesus Christ.  Were we even on the moon yet?  I think we had just gone to the moon.  I think the astronauts just got back.  Well, 69 was 74, wasn't it?  No, July of 69, we went to the moon.  I thought it was 72.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:30]  We went in 72 also.  But I think that was kind of the end of it.  Louie so far doesn't know when 9-11 happened.  Yeah.  And he doesn't remember when we landed on the moon.  Yeah, it was July 20th.  I just know it was 69.  It was 1969?  I just know that I was helping my dad plant shrubs in the front of our house when that  was going on.  Nixon was president.  That's all I knew.  Well, true.  Yeah.  You got that one.  I went to the Nixon Library.  I went to the Nixon Library and they have the phone that he called the moon with. 
[00:38:00]  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it has an extension number and I wrote it down because I thought...  You could call.  That might still be the president's extension.  Hello, Louie.  Louie, what are you doing?  I didn't think Nixon would answer the phone.  Oh, well, that would be...  Yeah, that would be odd.  Louie.  But it was one of those yellow phones.  Tell me a good joke about a Jew.  Hey, really fast football picks. 
[00:38:30]  I didn't do well with that either.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  I think I got to tell my brother to get lost, man.  He's doing my football picks this year.  He's doing a horrid job.  You're now in, I believe, last place.  I am tied for last place with Sam.  Sam, who has no clue about sports in general.  Sam knows absolutely nothing.  Yeah, Sam doesn't know which is the home team when he's looking at it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  God.  He doesn't know.  He's the second team. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, he didn't know that.  He's like, I don't know where they're playing.  He goes, because Ope said something like, just pick all the home teams.  He goes, I don't know which one's at home.  Like, just look for capital letters.  It's like the second team.  Or just capital letters.  It's usually at this.  When it's at, it means, you know.  So you know nothing.  No.  Do you know about the game at all?  Any of the basic rules of the game?  Like, could you watch the game and understand everything that's going on?  Not everything, but I would understand why somebody was winning.  Maybe I don't understand why they got it. 
[00:39:30]  Well, I wasn't even talking that basic.  Geez.  Yeah, when everybody jumps up and down and the numbers on the board go up.  Well, I get like, you got to go to the end of the field and pass all the time.  Do you know about, like, first downs?  No, I don't know anything about that.  Come on.  Are you serious?  No, I don't know first downs.  You don't know first downs.  What?  I know touchdowns.  Touchdowns.  How many downs do you get?  Wow.  How many downs do you get as a team?  Three.  Come on.  Stop.  This is too easy. 
[00:40:00]  I have no idea.  I went home over the weekend.  I'm tied with you?  Dude, you're tied with this guy.  My dad was like, how are you doing this weekend?  Elbow out!  He's out!  What?  My dad was like, how are you doing this weekend with the football picks?  And I was like, I have no idea.  I have no recollection of what teams I picked.  Yeah, you don't even remember the names of the teams.  I don't know what games we picked.  Wait, you think each team gets three downs?  I have no idea.  And then what happens?  Yeah, what happens after their three downs?  Do they get a couple of points?  They get a couple of points.  Let's say they have their three downs and they haven't made it to the end zone. 
[00:40:30]  What do they have to do?  They gotta stop there and then make it to the end zone.  But they're done.  They're done?  They're done.  They did their, as you said, three downs.  Are you gay?  No, I'm not gay.  What is going on?  What happened?  Let's say they had four downs.  Okay.  So what would they do on that fourth down?  Turn around.  Go the other way.  Go the other way.  Yeah.  By the way, I didn't mean to insult the gays because they... 
[00:41:00]  I mean, what the heck?  People are football fans.  Wow.  Wait, how many points for a touchdown?  That's six and then the extra point.  I know that.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  How many for a field goal?  I don't know anything about it.  I guess one.  If one keeps the extra point, I don't know.  Oh, come on, Sam.  One points.  I don't know anything about field goal.  Thanks for the good radio, but this can't be true.  No, it's true.  I feel like I should be Damone.  Yeah.  Hey, and don't forget about the, what, the 20-point spread.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, I don't know anything about the spread.  It's a lot.  You win.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If one team is on offense, what is the other team?  Defense.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Ah, defense.  And who's your favorite team in the NFL?  The Giants.  They're blue.  Oh, my God.  You're tied with this guy.  Oh, my God.  Brother Elmo.  Elmo.  Wake the F up.  Elmo self-destructed.  Well, he pulled a Mets.  This is what happened, Louie.  The football picks is pretty much who gives a crap.  I understand that. 
[00:42:00]  We're trying to make something out of it.  Last year, I was sucking with the picks.  So I handed it off to my brother.  He plays fantasy football.  And he came out of nowhere to win the whole thing with Travis.  He won me $10,000, I think, right?  Or $5,000 each.  We had to split the $10,000, which I still haven't gotten, by the way.  I don't know what's up with that.  And so this year, I'm like, all right, I'll have Brother Elmo pick the games from the beginning.  And all these guys are like, yeah, it's up there.  They're all bitching and complaining.  My brother's a disaster.  I'm tied with this guy. 
[00:42:30]  I'm tied with this guy in last place.  Who thinks that a field goal is one point.  Yeah.  Name one football player.  L.T.  He's getting a little old now, though.  No, he's not.  You're going to have to pick another one.  What's his record been this year?  Wow.  Well, I know he's not playing.  How many yards does L.T. have?  Pick one player that's playing.  Possession.  We got a new Sam bit.  I love this.  One lousy player.  Brett Favre. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Well, I didn't even barely.  Both football players, Sam's named, have been in movies.  Yeah.  Once they're in movies.  L.T. wrestled at WrestleMania, too.  Oh, okay.  He loves his wrestling.  And he's blue.  Or he was.  Yeah, he's blue.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm in last place with you.  Thank you, Dish Network, for helping us out with the football picks.  Wow, Sam.  All right.  We have to take a break. 
[00:43:30]  That is stunning.  Lack of knowledge.  I know other stuff.  I don't know football.  Yeah.  But even if you don't watch this, you should know something.  Have you ever sat with a game on?  Just sat for a few minutes?  Yeah.  I usually watch the Super Bowl.  Then you should have picked it all up.  You're stupid.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, even if you watch just the Super Bowl once a year, you should know all the rules.  At least the basics.  We're going to have to sign them up for one of those chick courses they do right around  Super Bowl time where they get the women together to teach them the rules of the game. 
[00:44:00]  Just watch a game.  I'm not talking you should know every time a yellow flag goes flying what the penalty  was.  My mother's a footballer.  She's a Patriots fan.  She has two Tom Brady action figures on top of her TV.  Two of them.  Really?  Made by two different companies.  You couldn't decide which one she likes.  Two of them.  Pats are unstoppable this year.  Yes, they are.  Oh, no.  Oh, I'm sorry, Boston.  Oh, no.  I'm so sorry, Boston.  You just heard it here. 
[00:44:30]  Sorry, Mom.  Remember, just mark that tape.  Mark what Opie just said.  And it knows when I'm saying stuff naturally and then not force it.  Yeah, that was sincere.  It just came out.  Oh, God.  I'm so sorry, Boston.  The curse gods are like, dude, give us a minute.  Yeah, hey, we're still dealing with your baseball team.  They really are unstoppable.  Okay.  Let's be honest with you.  All right.  Unstoppable.  You heard it here.  My Jets suck, D. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  How many yards to get a first down there, Sam?  I'll go 15.  Okay, 15.  Come on.  On a five-yard penalty.  What is a third back?  What is that?  Huh?  What's a third back?  It's like, I don't know, 33%.  It's amazing because I made it up.  It doesn't exist.  But he found a definition for it.  He has an answer.  But he has an answer for everything.  No matter how stupid or wrong it is, it's an answer. 
[00:45:30]  He's throwing him out.  He's giving it a shot.  All right.  Yeah.  Take a little break.  Yeah, we do have to take a break.  School this boy in football.  We'll get into the Sharpton thing.  We got another guy getting kicked off a flight for wearing a dumb T-shirt.  Lots of stuff to do.  We got the audio of Anthony falling asleep on the air.  We'll try to do that next, actually.  So stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony with Louis C.K. today.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:00]  Tom Chiasano just walked in here.  And I said, Tom, why are we even working today?  And he even said, yeah, I really don't know why you guys are here today.  I'm like, isn't this a great day to take off, recharge the batteries?  Like, as far as morning show listening goes, today is one of these days where most people are sleeping in because they don't have to work.  That's a great picture right there.  Iraq put up a picture of Tom Chiasano and Steve from Bayshore. 
[00:46:30]  Who now does the show rundown for the Opie and Anthony show.  And he's, I guess, commenting on Tom's tie.  Well, he does that every day.  Yeah.  When he sees Tom come into the studio on Pal Talk.  By the way, 923krock.com, 923krock.com for the Opie and Anthony show rundown.  It's great.  And now Steve's doing it.  And he links to all the stuff we talk about.  So if there's a video on the news or a cool website or a cool picture, it's all right there during the, you know, as you're reading the show rundown.  Yeah.  So we're trying to get another website so the rest of the stations could enjoy it a little more because, you know, the other radio stations don't like when we're promoting the New York station. 
[00:47:00]  So we're trying to come up with another website where that show rundown will be right there for everybody.  Gotta love Steve.  Give me Jackie.  I thought your guy also had a good response when you said that.  What's his name?  Tom, I don't know.  Tom Chiasano.  You said, why do we not have today off?  And he said, well, I didn't think of it.  And then you said, neither did I.  And he said, well, so my defense is the same as yours.  It's yours. 
[00:47:30]  It's very corporate.  It really was very corporate.  I'm sure that gets said in a lot of corporate boardrooms.  Well, my defense is the same as yours, sir.  He learned at the right hand of Mel Karmazan.  Yeah.  So sometimes he will kind of remind you of Mel in some of the ways where you'll be asked a question that has no answer.  Yep.  It is just thrown out there to kind of trip you up a little bit.  Absolutely.  My defense is the same as yours. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  Brilliant, right?  Perfect.  Yeah.  Very corporate.  That's in the corporate handbook.  Yeah.  Throw it back at them whenever you can.  Yeah.  We got Sailor E from Jacksonville.  Opie and Sleepy is easier to pronounce.  Opie and Sleepy.  Joe from Detroit.  Pardon me.  I just tuned in.  I was wondering if Ant brought a pillow today.  I'm not a narcoleptic.  Big Jesus Christ.  One time in all those years.  One time in 12 years, almost 13 years, I decide to snooze with a half hour left. 
[00:48:30]  If you're an air traffic controller, there'd be a thousand people.  That can be a problem.  Right.  Oh, sorry.  You can't afford once.  A D joke didn't get out.  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, well, Anthony fell.  He kind of went to sleep during the show on Friday.  Not just a little nod off like Rich Voss does from time to time.  Patrice O'Neill will doze a little bit.  Yeah.  During the breaks.  You know, this morning radio, it's a tough one.  I went through a phase where I was just nodding that I could have recovered, but there was 
[00:49:00]  no stimulus there to get me back to the waking world, so I just poof, out, gone.  So, Anthony was out cold.  We decided to leave the show, leave his microphone on, and I whispered in the background that we're  going to just play some very soft music so Anthony could continue his sleep.  Oh, it was nice.  And eventually, he will wake up, so have fun listening to this crap.  I'm going home early.  That's basically what I...  I found an excuse to get the F out early and still do Radio Gold. 
[00:49:30]  It was perfect.  Hey, you know something?  I was asleep, but by gum, I was there.  So, just really quick, we had Steve do some voiceovers, so could you play the first one?  This is actually Ant Sleeping, and then Steve just kind of checking in every once in a while.  Go ahead.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of the Opie and Anthony radio program.  Anthony has been asleep for nine minutes. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  And then it just continued with the soft music.  Now, you've got to remember, Anthony's mic was on.  Yeah.  Everyone was just waiting to see when he was going to wake up, and as that was happening,  Steve would pop in every once in a while.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of the Opie and Anthony radio show.  On XM Satellite Radio, Anthony has been asleep for 12 minutes.  Classical music, nice and soft. 
[00:50:30]  And the people on Pal Talk were watching me asleep, and there were record numbers of people.  We have had some things happen in studio that have been bizarre, sexual, violent, and not had as many people log on as there were people watching me sleep.  How many people were in there?  I believe it was over 1,000 at one point.  Wow.  Yeah.  It just got crazy. 
[00:51:00]  And for Pal Talk, that is giant numbers.  Yeah.  Like, right now, there's probably a couple hundred in there.  At any given time, in any of the nude rooms where, you know, guys will go in there and do their business because there's women doing horrid things to themselves, there's probably 250 people in there.  There were, like, 1,000 people in there watching me sleep.  Yeah.  You sleep.  And then it continued.  Steve popped in, you know, again.  You are listening to the soothing sounds of the Opie and Anthony show.  On XM 202, the virus. 
[00:51:30]  Anthony has been asleep for 15 minutes.  If you listen closely, you'll hear him wake up very gently and realize the microphone is still on and the studio is empty.  Enjoy.  And then finally, we did get to that point.  Oh, boy.  How many minutes was he asleep officially?  Did we figure it out?  24.  24?  Was it that long?  That's when we started keeping track, though.  Yeah.  He was out way before then.  I think it was close to a half hour in.  I got to say.  All right.  And this is finally Anthony waking up and realizing that everyone went home and that his mic was still live and people were going to, you know, listen to him wake up. 
[00:52:00]  I took a drink of water.  I should have known.  Sam. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  For the hyenas.  For the hyenas.  Yeah, I thought they were.  I saw.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Yeah.  I knew from the music.  Sorry.  Why else?  I'm sleepy.  Leave me alone.  I mean, not much there. 
[00:53:00]  It's just a guy waking up.  What do you mean by hyenas?  Was that in your dream or something?  No, no.  I was talking to Than and Sam.  Sam is there with the, he's like under, it looked like something out of Wild Kingdom.  He was behind a blind.  He was actually hiding and videotaping me.  And then I looked and knew that since the Paltor camera was zoomed in on me, that it was Than that had to have circumnavigated the camera.  So I was just like, oh, hyenas. 
[00:53:30]  A bunch of hyenas.  Well, they were kind of scared.  They didn't know how you were going to react when you finally woke up.  Yeah, with gunfire.  No kidding.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  What's up, Cigars?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I just find this as proof positive that you do better radio in your sleep than your competition.  Yeah, because everyone, no one turned off the show.  Well, I was.  We actually got more listeners because Anthony was asleep.  Asleep.  Note to self.  Because people wanted to see how it was going to end.  Note to self.  Sleep more on the air. 
[00:54:00]  It was a cliffhanger.  More sleep on the air.  I did get back some of the Pal Talk people, though, because I logged on Saturday night and just got railed.  The second I logged on, they wouldn't stop.  Hey, Rip Van Winkle.  Hey, you want to snooze?  There's not that many jokes.  Not many sleepy jokes that you can do.  Hey, you slept.  But, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  You falling asleep over there?  So it was Saturday night, and I'm just hanging out on Pal Talk and talking about stuff after they got past that point. 
[00:54:30]  And as I was on cam, I looped a video of me being on cam, and then I just switched it out for my live shot and left it on and went to bed.  I woke up the next afternoon.  I woke up on Sunday, probably at noon.  I got out of bed and went downstairs and turned my computer on.  It was still there, and the room is still full, and people are talking to me. 
[00:55:00]  Some people are on to it, and we're saying it's a loop, but other people are just like, no, dude.  And they go, dude, look at his windows.  It's nighttime.  It's noon.  Where is he, India?  Look how he jerks into weird positions.  Yeah, yeah.  And there was a little glitch in there.  Yeah, of course.  A little glitch from, yeah, like the scene from Speed where he set the video.  You could be dead for two years and keep your eyes.  Yeah, you could just still stay on Pal Talk. 
[00:55:30]  You could still be alive on Pal Talk.  Hey, so there you go.  The video, well, are we throwing up a video on our website?  We've got pictures of Anthony asleep on our website.  I like the one with my feet kicked up because that kind of makes it look like that's why  I kind of nodded out.  We also got some videos that are going up on YouTube.  The fans are making their own version of you sleeping on YouTube.  Oh, good.  It's becoming the latest on a phenomenon.  Yeah.  What do you got, Thad?  Yeah, the video's going up today.  We kind of just wanted to see how it played out today because right when Ant woke up, 
[00:56:00]  it might have just been, he was doing the eyes bugging out.  I was.  I was like, uh-uh.  But it looked like he wanted to kill everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Five foot range.  No, I was just confused.  Okay.  Sometimes you wake up in a hotel room and you go like, where the hell am I?  What day is this?  What time is that?  Am I supposed to be somewhere?  And I'm just like, yeah, that is confused guy eyes.  That is how I'm going to look in an old folks home.  Those eyes.  Dude, what were you thinking?  I need something to eat and I wet myself. 
[00:56:30]  What were you thinking when you looked around the studio and no one was around?  How creepy was that?  It started sinking in that, oh my God, I know I was nodding off and I must have fallen asleep.  I had no idea how long I'd been asleep.  The music's playing, so I'm like, and I looked around and I didn't see anybody, so I had no  clue.  It could have been five in the afternoon.  How long did you think you were asleep for?  Longer than I was.  I thought I was asleep for a couple of hours.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So that freaked me out. 
[00:57:00]  The worst thing in the world is waking up in jail.  When you go, because when you fall asleep in jail and you go somewhere else, you dream.  You're not going to be in jail.  Yeah.  You wake up and you go, oh my God, I'm here.  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's the worst.  Naps are the weirdest thing after work, because usually you've got to take at least an hour  so you can just function for the rest of the day.  And you wake up and you have no idea if you're supposed to be at work.  Yeah.  Like I look at the clock and go, oh my God, it's like four o'clock. 
[00:57:30]  I'm supposed to get up.  And then you look up, but it's light out.  But is it summer?  What the hell's going on?  Which five o'clock is this?  Yeah.  Those naps have no concept, though.  I mean, sometimes I'll wake up and I'll think, all right, I slept my hour, hour and a half,  and I look at the clock, I'm like, ten minutes.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So there you go.  You can check out all that stuff for yourself.  It's all over the place.  Have fun.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we should do this before break.  He wants Isaiah Thomas to apologize. 
[00:58:00]  And if Isaiah Thomas, of course, the head coach of the Knicks, doesn't apologize, he  wants everyone to stop going to Knicks games.  This is insane.  Isn't that happening?  Yeah.  Isn't that?  Well, yeah, it's happening.  Sharpton's the black guy, right?  He's the black guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Making sure.  Why is he getting involved in everyone's business?  Yeah, I don't know.  What does he want him to apologize for?  For saying derogatory things toward women.  Toward black women.  Toward black women? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, right, of course, because he doesn't care about anyone else.  That's true.  Called her the B word.  Bitch.  He called her that went, like, during the sexual harassment lawsuit that went down?  That she just got awarded $11 million for $11.5 million.  So he says she said that because of, like, he said that publicly?  No, during work.  During work.  What is he?  He's paying him $11 million.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's not good enough for Reverend Al.  Now Isaiah has to apologize.  Why does this guy think he can tell everybody what to do? 
[00:59:00]  How they should be apologizing and for what?  Or in telling people not to go to the games.  Yeah.  And more importantly, a dumb way to try to activate socially.  What a stupid idiot this guy is.  He's a jerk.  He's the worst guy alive.  And for some reason, and I blame the Democrats for letting him get up there and speak at their convention, he has this credibility that he never had before.  He was always the goofy sweatsuit, big hubcap medallion joke that would be a race baiting, taunting, you know, white interloper. 
[00:59:30]  No one took him seriously with the Tawana Brawley debacle.  And then he dresses in a suit and the Democrats let him talk.  And all of a sudden, he's got this credibility that people seem to think if he says something, they should do it.  He's an adult.  Well, this is what he's saying today.  Isaiah Thomas speaks to Reverend Al Sharpton, but so far.  And now freaking Isaiah Thomas has to meet with Reverend Al Sharpton. 
[01:00:00]  Why are people meeting with this guy?  Stop!  Let him crawl back to his crap hole that he was in.  It doesn't help if you said something.  Like every time somebody says that, well, I got to meet with the Reverend Al now.  Yeah.  And what's going to happen in that room, really?  Same thing that happened to Imus.  At least they showed that live.  Yeah.  It wasn't a private meeting.  It was on the air.  And you just saw him crucify Don Imus.  Don Imus did apologize.  Reverend Al wasn't accepting it.  No apology. 
[01:00:30]  Sharpton says he wants Thomas to say he's sorry for statements he made in a videotaped deposition shown in his sexual harassment case.  In that video, Thomas said it is worse for a white man to use the B word against a black woman  than it is for a black man to use the same word against a black woman.  Reverend Sharpton says if Thomas does not apologize, he will launch protests and call for boycotts of upcoming Knicks games.  Stop meeting with Reverend Al!  I know.  Enough.  Just stop!  He's not...  It's good enough... 
[01:01:00]  Don't you think it's good enough that this woman got 11 million?  Move on!  He's not even smart.  He's the coach of the Knicks!  He's not even intelligent.  No, he's not.  That's the thing.  He's not.  He's stupid.  He's a dumbbell.  I told Mr. Thomas that our position has nothing to do with whether the person using the language is black or white.  We do not have different standards for sexism or racism.  Thomas says he has nothing to apologize for since he has already clarified that it is wrong for any man to insult any woman. 
[01:01:30]  Tuesday, Isaiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden were found guilty of sexually harassing former Knicks executive Anuka Brown Sanders.  Thomas and MSG both say they will appeal.  You know what?  It's not wrong for any man to insult any woman.  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.  It's not wrong to insult a person.  It's insulting to them. 
[01:02:00]  But it doesn't mean you can't do it.  You can call people names.  Name calling is okay.  Yeah.  Because people get mad at each other and they call each other names.  Yeah, that's what happens at work.  People think that there's something in the Constitution that protects them from being offended.  Like there's something wrong with offending people.  Like they actually think it's in the Bill of Rights.  Freedom from being offended or feeling icky about something someone says. 
[01:02:30]  You're not.  You're not protected.  People get to offend you and you get to sit there and go, oh, that didn't bother me.  And then shut up.  There's nothing that keeps...  There's no right.  People have a right to be gross and insulting and people have a right to say bad things all they want.  Yeah.  And not according to Reverend Al.  Yeah, no, that's why he has to die in a pool of his own blood and secretions.  And you can't tell anybody to apologize. 
[01:03:00]  It doesn't work.  No.  You can't say apologize because it will not be a sincere apology.  It really has to come from yourself.  It's okay if he's not sorry.  Yeah, who cares?  Yes.  He's not sorry.  He's not sorry.  I'm not sorry.  He doesn't have to be.  No.  Wow, that's a lot of fruit, Kenny.  No kidding.  Thank you.  Hey, why don't we play the Reverend Al song today?  I love this thing.  Oh, this one is timeless.  This thing is almost 10 years old and it still makes sense today.  It still makes sense. 
[01:03:30]  Reverend Al, everybody.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan?  Yelling and a-screamin' as he's speakin' to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al, Reverend Al, he's your pal.  Reverend Al, well, he's sappin' off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always pickin' on me? 
[01:04:00]  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry, no justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an ass just like a buzz.  He's Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's your pal, Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always pickin' on me? 
[01:04:30]  Remember Bernie Getz and the Brawley case?  Turn on the TV, you would always see his face.  He's speedin' in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's your pal, Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for some good publicity. 
[01:05:00]  Why is the white man always pickin' on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming right.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  Well, he's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's a raised, faithin' white, hatin' bag of baloney. 
[01:05:30]  Now why is the white man always pickin' on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Yeah, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Hey, we got Anita from Long Island.  What's up, Anita?  You know, I think Reverend Al is not really hitting the target, the real target, and he's not  really hitting the issues.  If he wants to stop all this name, he needs to attack the first graders who are starting  it.  And then, and only then, if he attacks them and, you know, makes them pay money and boycott 
[01:06:00]  the first graders, then he'll probably get somewhere with this whole thing.  First graders?  What first graders?  What are they doing?  Oh, their name calling their asses off.  Right, Anita?  Exactly.  So if he attacks the first graders, if they're at the source, then maybe he'll get somewhere  with this.  So you're saying, yeah, like the first graders of the world are the ones that are starting  all this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  In the playgrounds.  I think he's afraid.  I think he's afraid to really hit the issue.  Yeah, something happens.  That would be awesome if he just started yelling. 
[01:06:30]  Something called Brenda Karloff.  And unless he apologizes, we're taking his crayons away.  Now, he said that she had cooties.  Right.  I demand an apology.  It's wrong for any little boy to say cooties to any little girl.  She does not have cooties.  This, I do not want to disparage cootie Americans.  People living with cooties.  People are not dying from cooties. 
[01:07:00]  They are living with cooties.  And if he don't apologize, we're taking his finger paints away from him.  Oh, God.  We are going to have him miss Friday pizza day.  Right.  If he does not apologize.  What a complete tool.  I need a first graders.  Where did that come from?  Here's the thing.  It used to be.  I have a first grader in the back seat right now.  Huh?  I have a first grader in the back seat right now. 
[01:07:30]  And, you know, she's name calling.  What is her favorite name?  What does she say?  Give us an example of her name calling.  Um, you know, they just caught this booger head and.  Booger head?  Booger head.  I demand an apology.  I demand that a booger head.  A head cannot be an entire booger.  It is not only inappropriate.  It is a real.  It is ridiculous to assume. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, by the way, let me fix this little girl up.  Circle, circle, dot, dot.  Now I have my cootie shot.  You are cured, young girl.  Is it true?  She said booger headed ho.  Booger headed ho.  This is inappropriate.  She's going to have to find a new school to complete first grade in.  What other, uh, thank God he counteracted with an I am rubber, your glue, whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you. 
[01:08:30]  What other name calling does she know?  You know, like Stinky Butt and things like that.  Stinky Butt is unacceptable.  Is this accurate?  This nation will not tolerate our beautiful black women and other girls being called Stinky Butt.  Stinky Butt.  Does she have a Stinky Butt? 
[01:09:00]  I'm calling for a boycott of the three-legged race.  No chocolate milk.  You may not watch Dora the Explorer for two weeks.  I have smelled the child's butt and it is not Stinky.  I am making a difference in America.  No chocolate milk, no peace.  There's a war going on, you idiot. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, stupid jackass.  A few more important things to deal with.  God, that's what, uh...  A lot of people pointing out at least he's going after a black guy for once.  Yeah, but that's just to show what he's doing.  He stinks.  That he's trying to clean everybody up.  Why don't you wash your little first-grader's mouth out with soap?  Yeah.  And the butt.  I think it's child abuse now.  Huh?  I think it's child abuse now to do that.  Yes, it is child abuse now.  Wash a mouth with soap, yeah.  Yeah, you can't do anything. 
[01:10:00]  You know, it used to just be called going to work and having a crappy day.  Yeah.  When your boss yelled at you and called you names and did things.  I've been called an a-hole.  I've been called horrid things on my jobs when I was working for a living.  Yeah, it's called life.  Too bad.  Deal with it.  It isn't worth $11.5 million.  And now, by the way, I just heard this morning, two other women, coincidentally enough, have just come forward.  Want their payday now.  And Madison Square Garden was sexually discriminating against them, and they now want the big friggin' payday. 
[01:10:30]  Well, that's their problem.  That's their thing.  But it has nothing to do with this guy.  You know what I mean?  It's got nothing to do with Reverend Al.  No, no.  Reverend Al should just stay the hell out of it.  And that's what the big issues is what little words that people are saying.  It doesn't even matter if the words are wrong.  It doesn't matter that they're wrong.  No.  It doesn't matter.  No.  If people say wrong things, even if you can definitely prove that it hurts lots of people's feelings, it doesn't matter.  No one gets to get protected from it. 
[01:11:00]  No.  You have to hear harsh, ugly things in life.  This woman wins $11.5 million, and she gets on and gives a speech about how she did it for all working women.  And you know what this does for working women?  Divvy up the $11 million, then.  Yeah, divvy up the $11 million.  She goes, I did it for every woman that has to go to work in the morning, now that she's not one of them.  But I think it makes bosses go, I'm not going to hire women, because I don't want to deal with this. 
[01:11:30]  And I'm scared S-less of women in the workplace.  We don't work with women.  When I see a woman in the hallway around here, I'm very nice and polite.  Very gentle pinch on the ass.  Very gentle.  I won't squeeze till it bruises.  Not anymore.  No, you can't leave marks.  A little pat is good.  A little pat on the ass.  Good job there, toots, I say sometimes.  Good job, toots, is nice, you know.  Yeah.  Maybe a little hubba hubba every once in a while.  Hubba hubba, nice stems.  I just use lingo from the 20s and 30s, so hopefully they don't understand and think I'm talking about work. 
[01:12:00]  Right, right.  Oh, it's just everybody.  Keep your nose out of everyone's business.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  And by the way, I was doing a voice just to help the bid along.  Relax.  I'm not trying to do voices.  Doing a voice equals not funny.  No, it's not even Mike that said that.  Go ahead, Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  This is an important call.  Mike, is that you? 
[01:12:30]  Why are you in the boys' room, Mike?  Mike.  Hello there.  Yeah.  Is your name Mike?  How are you?  Is your name Mike?  Good morning.  Is your name Mike?  Yes, good morning.  Is your name Mike?  Yes, it is.  So why does it take so effing long?  My brain is soft at this hour.  Well, it was really...  Then maybe you shouldn't call the radio show.  What do you got, Mike?  Listen, you guys are doing a great job with this story.  You're the only media outlet covering it all, the absurdity of it all. 
[01:13:00]  And not one mainstream outlet anywhere.  TV, radio has said two words about it.  A girl in the Midwest somewhere was practically raped at a McDonald's and was awarded $5 million.  She was tortured, methodically tortured, for two and a half hours by the nutty employee there.  How does that relate?  I'll tell you how it relates.  I'll tell you how it relates because it's a conversation Ant and I had.  Like, I was sort of following the Madison Square Garden, Isaiah Thomas thing and the sexual harassment thing. 
[01:13:30]  And when she was awarded $11 million, I'm like, God, horrific things must have happened to this woman.  There must have been some of that you-know-what type of action going on.  And then I hear that it was over a couple words.  Words.  And then we had calls coming in, Louie, all morning one recently where guys were like, dude, I pretty much lost my arm on the job.  I got $10,000.  Got $10,000 because his arm was ripped out of the socket.  And this woman was, like, practically raped and tortured and she got not even half with that woman. 
[01:14:00]  She got $5 million, but, yeah.  $11.5 million for words.  For words.  Words hurt that much?  That's the jerky boy's bit.  Well, I was hurt by his words.  Oh, God.  Were you injured?  Yes.  He still distributes the money.  And, look, you know, we don't want to have this whole issue confused here.  We understand that you shouldn't have to work in a hostile work environment.  But they've stretched that definition way beyond the bounds.  I think if a boss is smacking her on the ass saying, you know, if you keep up, you know, do a good job and you know what I mean, you'll get that promotion. 
[01:14:30]  And she's got to go into his office and sit on his lap or something in order to get a promotion.  There's a problem.  If the boss calls you a bitch or an a-hole, maybe you're being a bitch.  Maybe he's cranky.  He's the boss.  Is that why he said he say it, like, insultingly because he was mad at her?  Or did he just call his, hey, come here, bitch.  Right.  Well, I don't know.  But even that isn't worth $11.5 million. 
[01:15:00]  I think every Knicks fan should be awarded $11.5 million because they haven't had a team on that court in decades.  At this point, so worth following.  Sure is.  What does it say about the jury system?  It's ridiculous, Mike.  Absolutely ridiculous.  $11.5 million for a couple words.  And now Reverend Al basically wants Isaiah Thomas fired.  I mean, that's what he's hinting at.  A few more words.  That's what he's hinting at.  Women at work, it's like, it's hard. 
[01:15:30]  I think it must be just the years, the centuries that we are allowed to rape them for centuries.  That it wasn't even illegal until, like, 1948.  That's why I love watching those old movies.  They're like, hey, toots, come here.  Well, that's what I saw a movie recently about Doris Day having to land a plane because the pilot died.  Oh, Jesus.  And so the whole flight, she's landing the plane.  And everybody that comes on, all these different people keep.  It's one of the original 1940s help the lady land the plane things.  Every guy that comes on the horn goes, okay, honey. 
[01:16:00]  Okay, dear.  Right, honey.  You're doing a great job, sweetie pie.  All right, toots.  She doesn't care.  Keep your nose up.  But, like, my sister works at a, or years ago worked at a place, and there was a guy that worked there who liked to talk to women way too close.  And he'd sort of press his privates against their knees.  He would just press his.  Yeah, I got you.  Don't explain.  Self.  Yeah.  Their knee or whatever.  Wow, that's a little much.  And he did it to everybody, and they were all, none of them, they would talk about it in the break room, the women, but none of them could do it. 
[01:16:30]  They just felt paralyzed and unable to act.  And finally, my sister, during a meeting, he did it with everybody.  Like, he just sort of subtly came over and pressed.  And she loudly, in front of the boss and everybody, like, hey, how come you keep pressing that against my knee?  That's really, that's really inappropriate.  And he was just, he turned white.  And she was just like, you always do that.  You're so weird and sexually aggressive.  Wow.  Like, in front of the boss and everybody.  And he just, he, and then all the women did that from then on. 
[01:17:00]  I bet it ended.  They needed one example of like, yeah, just say stop it.  You pig.  All right, Toots, you're going to bring her in.  Now, see that thing that looks like a spatula handle?  That's the flaps.  Pull that down.  Now, turn the dial that looks like, um, like a washing machine control.  Yeah.  Turn that, like where you'd put rinse.  Yeah, do that.  Now, that other thing, it looks like, um, uh, a spoon you'd mix cake mix with. 
[01:17:30]  You got it there?  Sweet cheeks.  Hey, we're running really late.  We got to take a quick break here.  It's fantastic.  Hey, Lou, are you promoting anything today?  I'm at, uh, this weekend, I'm at the Hard Rock.  I mean, no, not the Hard Rock.  What am I saying?  The House of Blues in Vegas on Saturday.  On Saturday, okay.  And San Diego at the Spreckles Theater.  We got a nice following out, Wes.  We got a whole group of people that call themselves the Pess Out West.  The Pess Out West. 
[01:18:00]  Well, please come see me Saturday at the House of Blues.  You'll see some POWs, they like to be called, out at your show this Saturday.  Yes, it's Saturday and Friday at the Spreckles Theater in San Diego.  Let's not forget, Jay Leno tonight, uh, little Jimmy Norton will be on.  Jimmy.  Check him out.  He's out there in L.A., uh, taping in a few hours or whatever, later this afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony, Louis C.K. today.  Jim Norton out there in L.A.  Getting ready for Jay Leno tonight.  Make sure you take a peek.  Phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Let's say hi to Spyro in, uh, Cleveland. 
[01:18:30]  Or Spiro.  What is it?  Spiro?  Spyro?  What is it?  Greek.  Yeah, it's Spiro, man.  What's up, Spiro?  What's up, man?  I never hear from anybody from Cleveland.  I'm talking to Bash Maxwell.  You're what?  And you guys were talking about them last week.  They got all these crappy billboards in Cleveland.  That radio was hack radio, dude.  Oh.  Yeah, we were talking about them last week.  Oh, yeah, we slapped them around a little bit.  I guess that's, like, a huge thing for their show. 
[01:19:00]  For us, it's just one of many things we're doing.  So, you know, there you go.  Hey, uh, go Indians, by the way, huh?  Oh, yeah, man.  Yeah, it's awesome.  And what's going on with LeBron James wearing that Yankee hat during the game?  What's going on?  He's a douche.  He's a douche.  That is, like, that's pretty bad.  Who's LeBron James?  LeBron James is the star player of the Cleveland Cavaliers, of course.  And during the Cleveland Indians game in Cleveland, he's sitting in the stands with a Yankee cap on.  Oh.  And he said that he's been a Yankee fan his entire life. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, okay.  But maybe.  He's a Cleveland.  Yeah, but maybe you should go to the game without the Yankee hat.  It's a different sport.  You can't pay millions of dollars to fake it, though.  You know?  You're supposed to have some city pride.  Yeah, I know.  They're slaves to their uniforms.  That's it.  Who cares?  There's no city pride.  If he got a deal to go somewhere else, then he's supposed to be a fan of that city's team?  Well, the rumor is he's going to come down here to Brooklyn when the Nets go to Brooklyn.  There you go.  Then he could be a Dodgers fan. 
[01:20:00]  Because he's...  The old Brooklyn Dodgers.  Oh, it's going to be the Brooklyn Nets.  And Jay-Z's pretty much, what, the owner of the team or the part owner or whatever?  Yeah.  So, and your buddy there, your buddy, you're not a Pats fan, are you?  I like the Pats.  I don't pay attention to them.  Tom Brady during the offseason walking around downtown Manhattan with a Yankee hat on.  Was he really?  Oh, wow.  Get out of here, really.  Yeah.  Wow.  They're an awfully good team.  They weren't really happy about that in Boston.  No.  He's just walking around with his chick with a Yankee cap on trying to, I guess, fit in down  here.  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  But there was a little outrage as far as that goes.  Who do you think's going all the way as far as football goes?  Oh, man, the Pats are unstoppable this year.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  What are they, 5-0 at this point?  Oh, you just tell them up.  5-0, man.  That's great.  Yeah, that'll look like, oh, my goodness, then they started out so promising at 5-0.  Oh, no.  In Chicago, a couple marathoners dead because of the heat.  Yeah.  And this leads into the discussion we're having during the break here. 
[01:21:00]  It's not supposed to be summer in October, and it's kind of summer in October for the  East Coast.  And I used to be like a, I never ran a marathon officially, but I used to run a lot of half  marathons.  I was a runner back in my day.  And they plan these marathons in these cities when the temperature is a bit cooler.  It's supposed to be cool right now.  Right.  You're not supposed to be running a marathon in 90-degree weather.  And Chicago.  Chicago in October is supposed to be brisk.  I was in L.A. just now, and it was like in the 50s. 
[01:21:30]  It was cold when I left, and I landed in Kansas City, and it was like 90 degrees.  And then I went to Wisconsin.  I was just in Madison, Wisconsin, and it was over 90.  Yeah.  What the hell?  It makes no sense.  And here in New York, it's just been in the 80s, and it's been great.  It's going to be 86 today in New York.  I love the global warming.  By the way.  I love it.  We know that LeBron is from Cleveland.  Yeah.  He plays for the Cavaliers, but he's also born and raised in Cleveland as well.  We know that drama, Daddy. 
[01:22:00]  Well, the Yankees are a good team, and Cleveland is not any kind of city to be proud of.  Sorry.  I just want to be a jerk.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  Yeah, good afternoon, Cleveland.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  So, we were talking about the global warming thing.  Yeah, it's not.  We were saying how people think we're doing something wrong, but we're not aside from  the Earth.  We're part of it.  We're organisms that came out of the Earth, and now we're making it go cold. 
[01:22:30]  That's what's supposed to happen.  Yeah.  Whatever happens is supposed to happen.  Yes.  We're not.  We're part of nature.  We are animals indigenous to this planet.  So, whatever we do, whatever resources we are smart enough to dig out of the ground or  pull out of the air or the water.  Well, it's not even smart.  It's just we're organisms, we're like yeast that eat sugar and make alcohol by pooping  it.  Right.  We just, we take stuff out of the ground and we burn it, and it's going to make the  Earth.  But if there's not, people have this thing that they think the Earth is supposed to 
[01:23:00]  last forever, that we have a right to this forever.  Again, the right.  Yeah.  No, we don't.  We have no protection from global warming.  It's what's going to happen.  And it's our, we're making it happen, but so what?  It's not a moral thing.  There was a, there was a.  It's supposed to be over now.  It's supposed to, the oceans are going to rise.  Manhattan's going to be an underwater theme park for a while.  You're going to get to visit it by submarine.  Which would be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  And it's a shame that my grandchildren won't know they'll, they'll, they'll, you know, 
[01:23:30]  they'll be cooked by the sun.  Well, Louie, one of our.  Die on a rock.  That makes me sad personally.  Yeah.  But I don't believe that that's, like I was saying, the Republican, the first ice age wasn't  some Republican atrocity.  It just happened.  And this one's going to happen.  One of our favorite things as far as global warming goes in Manhattan, they'll show the  dramatic, you know, video of what Manhattan's going to become because of global warming.  And all of a sudden, like, they show buildings that have 20 feet of water on the sides. 
[01:24:00]  Cool.  And cars are floating.  Floating.  And the subways are flooded out all the way to the street level.  And Ed and I, we're like, we're humans.  We adapt.  When the, when the waters start rising, we'll just start building walls and other things  to try to figure it out.  We'd do something.  And if worse came to worse where it's like, well, we're going to lose Manhattan.  Do you think there'd be cars left?  Like that it happens that quickly?  Right.  That the water raises it in 20 feet in a day?  What?  Like we'd get, we'd salvage everything. 
[01:24:30]  We'd be taking bricks.  Like there's a dramatic picture of what Manhattan would look like if the oceans rose.  No.  But before it got to that point, don't you think we'd figure stuff out?  Don't you think as soon as we start seeing puddles forming as human beings, we're like,  hmm, we got to do something about this.  If we don't do something about this, that's what's going to happen.  The city's going to be in the middle of the ocean.  People aren't going to be on the roofs of those buildings.  No.  Help, help.  I've been here for 25, 30 years.  Yeah.  They're going to be on the roof.  They're going to be in houses in another part of the country. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Because we're still America.  We're still, we still have every, more than everybody else.  It's not like, you know, the unwashed billions that are just going to get, you know, that  are dying anyway.  They don't need global warming to die.  People in Darfur and whatever, they're dying anyway.  So you're a fan of just, ah, don't even worry about it.  Well, I just don't think, no, I mean, look, if people would like to have the earth a little  longer, then they should slow down.  But it's not a moral thing.  Nobody's doing anything morally wrong because we are just, and we're part of nature. 
[01:25:30]  You know what amazed me?  We're elements of nature.  It's always amazed me is the fact that we just took crap that was laying around, just  figured out how to take metal from the earth, melt it, make it into things, take things from  the air, chemicals from trees and water.  But nothing, we didn't have to go out of space, out into space to grab anything.  We figured everything on this earth and we were able to slap together machines that fly. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  How great are we as human beings?  That's what I'm talking about.  Global warming.  If we were a little smarter, we would put all of the energy that we have, like nuclear  energy and stuff, we would use it to keep making rockets to get off of the planet and  make a new one.  It's with it.  We could do that.  Make a new one somewhere.  So that would, but we're using a lot of that energy to off each other, to kill each other. 
[01:26:30]  So that's-  Yeah, we kind of like doing that.  But again, that's a shame.  I just don't think it's like-  That's something we've been doing for-  Human race isn't supposed to last forever.  We're going to go at some point.  Right.  We've been killing each other for forever.  Everybody dies.  Every band stops making hits.  You know?  Like when they show on VH1, they're like, what happened to Love and Spoonful?  Why aren't they still number one every week forever?  They just stop.  Because everything has a crest.  Everything has a little curve to it.  A lifespan. 
[01:27:00]  Hey, they're showing pictures of the Empire State Building underwater with a couple-  Just two sharks.  A couple sharks.  Sharks swimming around.  Like if the Empire State Building is underwater, it's going to be crystal clear like you're  in the Bahamas.  Just like that.  Just like that.  That's what it's going to look like.  The Bahamas!  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going to have Bahamas water all of a sudden up here.  Not the murky crap that we do have surrounding Manhattan.  I don't agree with either side of the argument, though.  Because the people that say this isn't going to happen are liars also.  Yeah.  People that say global warming is a myth and it's got nothing to do with mankind. 
[01:27:30]  Those people are liars.  They're just greedy liars.  Yeah.  And the people that say, oh no, it's horrible.  They're just stupid.  I have this third feeling, which is, yeah, it's happening, but so what?  So it's time to die now.  I can't see it happening this quickly.  No, it's also not going to happen that fast.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It might.  People are freaking out that, look, there it is, the taxi cab in the water.  Yeah.  Like that guy got caught up in global warming.  Like, it's an event that just, it's like getting caught in a glacier. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  Oh my God, a glacier in 10,000 years.  I'm screwed.  Yeah.  Glacier.  And look what we did.  We dug out New Orleans and then that's back to normal.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Tourism's up.  They got rid of some riffraff.  It's called sarcasm.  They're in Houston now.  We're back to getting it to where it was.  Okay.  Yeah.  We figured some things out.  No, I don't think we will.  I think New Orleans is probably over.  And people that are like, how is America going to keep being number one? 
[01:28:30]  It's not.  Nothing lasts.  You know what?  Rome didn't last.  America's not going to last.  No empire lasts.  Yeah.  It just doesn't.  We don't get to be as safe as we were.  We just don't.  Yeah.  And what is...  It's China's turn.  We need to really kick the crap out of someone as a country.  I don't mean an Iraq war thing.  I mean a devastating ass kicking to give to a country that'll show like, hey, look, we  still got it.  Don't screw with us.  Don't mess with us.  I might even be talking nuclear. 
[01:29:00]  It would be funny if we just went after somebody like Spain.  Random.  Spain.  Like just some country.  A massive airstrike and then an invasion.  It would be so awesome if Bush did that on his way out.  Just invade Spain and everybody's like, what are you doing?  And he's like, so?  So what do you want?  Some country that's in expect it.  Yeah.  Just out of nowhere.  That's part of America now.  It's ours.  Yeah.  It's like another state.  What are you going to do about it?  We got nuclear weapons and we'll use them.  We have before. 
[01:29:30]  It would work.  What would they do?  Oh, okay.  I guess the UN would be, well, we have to speak very strongly about what the United States  did.  Sanctions.  Yeah.  We got everything we need here.  Shut up.  Let's go to Adam in North Carolina.  Adam.  Adam.  Adam.  Adam doesn't know his name either.  North Carolina, dude.  Global warming is about saving ourselves.  You.  Oh.  Are you there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead, Adam.  Hey, I was just letting you know that a global warming, it's not about saving the planet. 
[01:30:00]  The planet will always be here.  It's about saving us as a human race.  Well, it's...  Yeah, but that's the thing.  I don't think that that's a moral issue.  I think if it's time for the human race to be underwater and extinct, then that's going  to happen now.  I'm sure the mammoth...  It's time for that.  I'm sure the mammoth wanted to hang out for a little while longer.  Yeah, exactly.  Or the three-toed sloth.  You know, there's people that believe that we were apes. 
[01:30:30]  There's a theory of evolution called the aquatic ape theory, which says that we were apes that  got underwater.  Like, we were apes that were on an island, and we had to start swimming.  And that's how...  If you take an ape and you make him swim for thousands of years, he'll start to have, you  know, no fur, and it straightens your back.  Your back straightened out through not walking, but through swimming.  And that's what made us smarter.  Interesting.  It made us smarter.  It made our snouts turn into noses, because they're better for swimming. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And that some of us kept going and became dolphins, and that the rest of us are humans.  Too lazy.  We're like, ah, stop right here.  That's good enough for me.  I'm just going to stop here.  Yeah, this is good.  Exactly.  I like that.  And we came back to Earth, so that just happened.  There weren't the apes that stood there and went, this isn't right.  We're so pompous, dude.  I want to still be an ape.  Humans want to last forever.  No, we're not going to.  And of course, I would love to see humans last forever, but yeah, it's not in the cards.  No, it's not.  We're pompous. 
[01:31:30]  And it's going to be something so ridiculous that takes out our humans.  Yeah, it's going to be like a bee or something.  It's going to be some kind of bee.  So the last person is going to be like, wow, who saw this as the end?  I love Pot Talk Monday.  Yeah.  It is Pot Talk Monday.  Love Pot Talk Monday.  It's going to be some kind of space dust that just happened to be on an astronaut's sleeve  that they forgot about.  Just some dumb thing.  The Andromeda Strain.  That just wipes everybody out. 
[01:32:00]  Yep.  And no one saw it coming.  I think it's going to be one bee, like one specific bee.  Just like have some super sting.  Yeah.  And it's lethal.  And 100% of the cases.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can protect and do everything we can to make sure we're here for a while, but  it's going to be something so ridiculous in the end.  How do you think you'd hold up in a post-apocalyptic world there, Louie?  Yeah, I don't think I would do so good.  Everyone likes to think they do really good.  No.  It's like, I don't know.  I wouldn't be one of the survivors. 
[01:32:30]  I would just be a psychopath with guns and just...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I would just kill people to take their stuff.  You would hang in there?  I'd have to, yeah.  I would hit the woods.  Would you just hit the woods?  Hit the woods.  Find like-minded people like myself in the woods.  I'd be a marauder until I get blown up.  No, and it makes sense that, look, I have kids.  I want them...  When I leave a hotel room, I turn off the air conditioning.  Ooh.  You know, whatever.  I do what I have to do.  I leave the air conditioning on and open the doors in the Bahamas. 
[01:33:00]  Like a sliding glass door is blowing 95 degree humid air in, and I got the air conditioning  blasting the TVs on.  Yeah, you got weather fronts.  Oh, I don't care.  I don't care.  I do what I can because of my kids, but at some point, we're going to be the last generation  of humans.  Somebody's going to be the last one.  Someone's going to be the last.  And it's not our fault.  We're just dumb animals.  Do you want it?  I don't understand when you have kids, but don't you kind of want it to be your generation? 
[01:33:30]  That's the last.  Oh, that's the thing.  It's some strange way to see the whole end of it all.  I want to keep Manhattan underwater.  I mean, I want to...  Yeah, at least that.  Yeah.  That would be cool.  Submarines and stuff.  Yeah.  That would be really good.  Hey, it is Pot Talk Monday.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah.  But that's something...  It's funny because every generation wants to be the last generation.  Yep.  You know, they want to be the one that thought they knew what cool music was.  That was it.  Right?  No one coming after me, man.  That's it.  I know what's cool when it comes to music. 
[01:34:00]  We're the legacy.  We're the legacy of this planet.  Some generation should decide to be the last one and, like, neuter themselves and just  have one last generation where everybody just drinks and has sex.  And uses all the oil they can.  Just uses everything.  Just drives gas guzzlers.  And then just dies.  They drive on the highway in that vehicle that pulls the space shuttle out of the building.  Yeah, right?  Exactly.  Just drive around it.  That's what you drive to work in.  You know, after you get past the fact that you're the last generation, that after you, 
[01:34:30]  the Earth is going to be awfully strange, whatever, you can have a lot of fun.  Yeah, you sure can.  You can have a lot of fun.  You know, the last astronauts take the space shuttle and just go out.  Just leave.  Turn into skeletons somewhere near Saturn.  Yeah, who cares?  Just unprotected sex with anybody.  Yes.  Oh, it's great stuff.  Walk around with guns.  Unlock the prisons.  Let them all out.  Who cares?  So, when we're gone, who takes over the world?  Whatever, you know, animal.  Whatever bug.  Yeah, whatever's next. 
[01:35:00]  Ants.  Well, what animal would it be?  I think there would be some kind of bug.  Well, there wouldn't be one.  There probably wouldn't be one.  There wouldn't be one with the divine spark that we have.  I understand that.  Well, the dinosaurs have it.  I don't know.  What animal takes over?  That's why I think it's creepy that we're like, we're animals.  Yeah.  But there's no second place.  There's no vice animal.  That's what creeps me out.  We are not the vice president of humans.  We've had this discussion many times.  That creeps me out.  It's like, why isn't there someone in second place just kind of like waiting for us to 
[01:35:30]  F up?  That we look at like, oh.  You're looking at it wrong.  Because you're picturing like an animal doing like a, you know, like a.  Like kind of a retarded human.  You're picturing like an elephant in a suit.  But dude, now he owns a baseball.  But that's what we joke about.  We're like, why aren't you taking a bus with, I don't know, a squirrel or like some other  life form.  Because that's how we roll.  But bugs are actually a bigger, they have more run of the joint than we do. 
[01:36:00]  This place would look totally different too.  After a few years of no humans being around to maintain the roads and the buildings, this  place would just look like a vined, overgrown mess that some other animal would just take  long.  No.  No, we're living on.  But doesn't it creep you out that there's nobody even near us as far as there's a massive  drop off?  We're actually.  Massive drop off.  Well, that's only if you measure us as the apex.  But all the other animals and say we're getting the most out of the planet.  But Louie, all the other animals kind of live together and they're kind of like similar. 
[01:36:30]  And they're doing fine.  And we are the only ones that do not belong on this earth.  Well, this is how we survive.  Yeah, we're a little weird.  We were weak animals, so we built these.  We have the.  All right, so why aren't.  Shelters and huts are just weird.  They're huge and metal.  Why aren't the dolphins building stuff?  Because they don't need to.  Because they survive.  Why hasn't one other animal built something that is like almost similar to what we do?  Even close.  But that's like a lion.  Even the apes.  You don't even see one animal using something to get themselves around. 
[01:37:00]  Well.  Like a primitive bike or something.  A primitive bike.  That means they're going to see a monkey just driving a bike that came from like Gilligan's  Island.  I think we come from somewhere else and that's why.  Do you think so?  Yep.  I think we come from.  Yeah, he's a very strong believer in that.  I think we just landed here.  Brought here, dropped off, never gone here on the first place.  If you really, if you start with an ape before there were us and you just start, he just  starts figuring stuff out little by little, you just get here.  This isn't, to me. 
[01:37:30]  But no other animals getting there.  This isn't a big deal.  No other animals getting there.  That's not their way that they survive.  Their populations are doing fine without all this shit.  But they're all still, but they're all just kind of living in harmony with each other,  just kind of using the basic.  Well, not only do they eat each other.  Yeah, but they're using just the basic stuff.  They're not really making anything that impressive with the basic raw materials.  We got nuclear power plants.  We got space shuttles way up there.  We harnessed the power of the atom. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, what are the giraffes doing?  They're doing nothing.  Zebras aren't looking at us going, I wish I had a Bentley.  But doesn't that make you think that they're not doing anything?  They're not doing anything.  There isn't one other animal out there doing anything.  Every once in a while, an animal will make a pile of dirt.  We're amazed when a monkey takes a stick and puts it in a termite hole and pulls it out.  He used a stick.  That's what creeps me out.  There's no other animal out there that's even close to us. 
[01:38:30]  Nobody has a Barbie lunchbox.  Nobody has a weed.  No, nothing.  There's not one wallaby that is doing a morning radio show today.  Dude, we're building like...  There's not one hyena who has a Wii.  A Wii, playing the Wii.  Who can play Halo.  I'm sure animals, some would probably love playing the Wii.  Look at all the buildings outside.  What is the rest of these animals doing?  Nothing.  They're walking around eating each other. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  A pile of dirt here and sleeping in a cave.  They're doing fine.  Hope makes a good point on this one, Louie.  We kind of are a little odd to this planet.  It creeps me out that there's a massive drop-off after us.  And that's why I'm convinced we're just not from the original.  I'll tell you what I really don't think is definitely...  What I think is definitely not the answer is that God made us and made us special.  No, I don't buy that either.  I don't buy for a second.  I don't buy that either.  The whole story behind it is too fantasy-like.  Yeah.  I want records.  I want parchment records. 
[01:39:30]  I want the schematic that he used.  Something.  No, we're an unchecked mammal.  That's all.  We're overpopulating.  It's just because no one eats us.  All right.  One out of all the animals out there.  That's creepy.  Know how many different animals there are out there?  Not one.  If you put us on a graph like what we've done and what everybody else does, they're all  way down here.  One's a little better than the other.  We have medicine.  No other animal uses that.  If any other animal gets sick or injured, they're dead. 
[01:40:00]  That's right.  They're dead.  We came up with medicine.  I mean, like Hope says, give me a close or even a distant second place animal.  Who's in second place?  Seriously.  Who's in second?  I don't know.  Well, again, people would argue dolphins or gorillas.  In technology and literature and technology, I think we're definitely a far first.  Literature.  Far first is not even another animal that can read a word. 
[01:40:30]  But as far as taking care of ourselves and being healthy and sustaining as a species,  we're not that much better than the other ones.  The other ones are keeping their numbers fine and they're probably more stable.  Yeah.  They probably don't get the same diseases we do.  Most of those, they just die of old age a lot of those animals.  Or something else ripping its throat out.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't think there's a big problem with breast cancer among the raccoons.  You know what I mean?  I don't think that, like, I don't know, I could be wrong. 
[01:41:00]  Not one other animal goes to school, goes to work.  That's right.  Nothing.  But I don't think any hippos have diabetes and are nearsighted.  And they're overweight.  Right.  Good point.  We just come from somewhere else.  It's time that we admit that.  The than animal is panicking with the brakes.  All right.  We're very late.  There you go.  Pot Talk Monday.  That's what we do.  Pot Talk Monday.  We still haven't done Free Ringtone Monday Mania or Feel Good Story Monday.  We'll try to get to those before we get out of here. 
[01:41:30]  Hope you have a feel good story.  Hey, you know that you have a bunch of crap lying around your place that you don't want  or need.

What?  Okay. 
[01:42:30]  We're in the middle of Pot Talk Monday.  Wow.  It's a simple question.  The humans, top of the food chain, doing a lot of interesting things on this planet.  Yeah.  It's a simple question.  Who's second?  Who's number two?  Who's number two?  And before you give your answer, Louie, a lot of people are giving theirs on instant feedback.  Okay, let's hear them.  You got CW from Scranton.  Deer.  They're taking over the world.  Look at how many we run over every day, and they still keep coming back. 
[01:43:00]  Nah.  It's not deer.  It's nothing to do with pure population.  How about Stephen S. from Bayshore?  Give the edge to any species that can balance a beach ball on its nose.  Ah.  Yeah, well.  The dolphin.  The seal.  The seal.  The killer whale.  None of that translates into any skill that's useful.  And you can't really say that a water-based animal is going to take over.  Well, actually, most of the world is water, and...  Yeah.  So they should be kicking ass right now. 
[01:43:30]  They are.  See, that's us...  Over us.  See, that's us being pompous.  I guess.  That's us being pompous once again.  Yeah, because we haven't even seen the bottom of the ocean.  No.  Yeah, but we've seen enough of it to know they're not building crap down there.  We don't even know how many...  There could be...  There's probably, like, a planet, like, ten feet away from Earth, full of people.  Ten feet.  They're like, look how dumb these things...  Just look over here, ass.  Jerk off.  We got a submarine that almost went far enough to discover a whole other civilization. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And the people were in a panic as they see this thing slowly, you know, going down.  Oh, good.  They're going back up.  They're going back up.  They got scared by those glow-in-the-dark fishes.  All right.  We're good.  Yeah.  We're good.  No, we have no idea.  Hey, then you got Bobby D. from Brockton, Mass.  I've seen a bear riding a bike at the circus.  Again, these...  Because we were talking about...  Imitations of human...  Yeah.  But we were talking about other animals and why...  Trained by a human.  Why aren't they figuring out other ways to get around?  To do that.  Like, why didn't they figure that out themselves? 
[01:44:30]  But Bobby D...  That's exactly what Bobby D. writes.  He goes, I'm pretty sure they strapped his feet to the pedals, but he could do it, so...  Yeah, but that bear is still just evidence of how cool humans are.  That we can teach a bear to ride a bike.  But there's nobody in second.  That bothers me.  We're watching TV here in the studio.  Why doesn't another freaking species have some kind of TV network?  Even just the big old CRT ones.  Right.  Even like just the...  Like with tubes.  Yeah, something.  Where they have one channel.  Like seals have a TV channel. 
[01:45:00]  There's some penguin adjusting the aerial.  Right.  Nothing.  It's ants.  I'm telling you.  So you said ants.  Hold on.  You want more answers?  A couple more.  James T.  Ants.  Well, he likes turtles.  So he's thinking turtles are insane.  I like turtles.  I like turtles.  Yeah.  Yes.  Certainly do.  You're a little tight.  Beavers.  They build dams and huts out on the water to live in.  Derek from Jersey.  That's pretty good.  And you say ants.  Someone says the bee.  The bee is second.  Shelter, communication, organized societies. 
[01:45:30]  That's from Nick in Ontario.  Why do you say ants are even smarter than bees?  They have an amazing society.  Yeah.  There's one thing.  One detail about what ants do.  They keep cattle.  They're called aphids.  Yeah.  Ants take aphids.  They milk them.  Which is a smaller bug.  And they take them.  They catch them.  They bring them down into their homes.  And they keep them in the coolest part.  Like the nicest part.  The refrigerator.  Yeah.  And they put them along the walls of where they live. 
[01:46:00]  And they milk them.  They actually squeeze their nipples and get milk out of them.  And feed aphid milk to their young.  And they keep them.  That's amazing.  They feed their aphids very carefully.  And they have food specifically for them.  All right.  They're getting ready to take over.  That's creepy.  It's pretty good.  What ants can do.  Do they have ant TV though?  No.  But they communicate really well.  They do a, you know.  Like you know when you see an ant trail from food to a hole?  Yeah.  The way that got started is an amazing. 
[01:46:30]  I mean the way that they.  They just spray out in all directions.  A little rub the antenna.  The antenna.  They got like a scout that goes out.  And then he comes back and tells the other guys.  And then the other guy.  He'll eat a little bit of the food.  But he'll take some back with him and put it into the mouth of the other.  And they feed each other.  Yeah.  That ant trail thing is really creepy.  Last time I was on vacation I was down in Turks and Caicos.  And I almost cut the tip of my finger off just slicing it to a pineapple.  And it just starts bleeding like crazy.  A puddle of blood outside my room on the balcony.  Right.  And I'm just staring at the blood on the floor. 
[01:47:00]  Within seconds.  Seconds.  Yeah.  There was a line of ants coming up the wall over the rail and down toward the blood.  Drinking it up.  That's how quickly they told each other.  Within seconds.  That's how quick.  And they don't smell it.  They don't smell it.  It's just that one randomized ant scout found it.  And that's how quickly he was able to tell his whole column.  They don't know where it is.  Start bringing your blood.  And now your DNA has fed.  Like your blood was fed to an aphid whose milk fed the young ants. 
[01:47:30]  So there's like little ants with your face on them running around.  Maybe I'm their god.  Yeah.  Totally.  You know what?  I like your thinking about the ant being second in line.  But I don't know.  We can.  I personally can kill a billion ants in minutes.  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing.  There's way more than a billion now.  We're going to be killed by some asteroids.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, we're the same.  We're just as fragile.  And you're talking about numbers. 
[01:48:00]  Do you think the ant tries to come up with a defense against the human foot?  Like we with the Astro, we talk about we could shoot nuclear missiles at it or do this.  Or, you know, we'll send a drill team up and put a bomb in there or whatever the hell movie you come up with.  That's why they're better because they're just like, ah.  The foot comes, it comes.  What are we going to do?  The big foot.  And how organized are they?  All you have to do is knock over a little anthill and you see how unorganized it is.  Oh, when they start running around all crazy.  They start running around like, ah.  Well, that's what it looks like to you.  But they're already rebuilding.  Yeah, they line it back up. 
[01:48:30]  If you come back a couple of minutes later, it's back up.  None of this 9-11, what are we going to call it?  Is there a spire?  Should we build a park?  You know what?  They don't have.  There's no Mayor Bloomberg ant going, I just think we need to rebuild.  They just start rebuilding.  They just start doing it.  They just start doing it.  If it was up to the ants, we'd have those towers built already.  No red tape.  No ants.  There's no like red state ants and blue state ants.  Right.  They just do it.  No, there's no Gingrich ant.  I love Pod Talk Monday.  I love it.  There's no black ants with weird hair complaining that some ants, that the red ants are. 
[01:49:00]  And you talk about knocking over an anthill and they just go nuts, like New Orleans.  Yeah.  With the hurricane there.  Yeah.  Yep.  Same thing.  There's no ants flying over the, after the foot comes, some ants fly over and assess the damage.  But if aliens were looking at it from above, they're like, look at these stupid humans.  They don't know what they're doing.  But you know, this hurricane knocked their city apart.  And look, they're running around like crazy.  But we were organizing. 
[01:49:30]  It took a while.  We just gave all the money to Halliburton.  We're not doing anything for those people.  Are you kidding?  New Orleans is gone.  It's full.  It's just Halliburton squeezed it for whatever was left and that was the end of it.  It was time for another city to move up.  Yeah, again, that's what I feel.  So what?  It's Rochester's turn.  Yeah.  It's Rochester's turn.  That's right.  They've been waiting for this moment.  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe in Queens.  Joe.  Yeah, there is no animal on Earth anywhere near us, and I can prove it with one word. 
[01:50:00]  Veterinarians.  We've got to help them when they're sick and injured.  Let's see a dog or a monkey operate on a person.  Yeah, why aren't they helping themselves and figuring out how to make each other better?  They don't have.  Thank you, Joe.  You're right.  But we only help them because we use them and have them as pets.  They're just supposed to die when they get sick.  Joe makes a great point, though.  Why aren't they?  Joe doesn't make a great point.  I'm sure a dog would like to live a little longer instead of sitting there and die of  some whacked out.  No, it wouldn't.  How do you know?  Because they don't mind dying.  They just lay down and die. 
[01:50:30]  They're not scared of dying?  I don't think so.  I don't think that old dog that's got the hip dysplasia and arthritis who's sitting there  going like, ah.  Yeah, he's got like somebody put a fake valve in his heart, and he's like, dude, let me  go.  I just want to die.  I haven't taken a hard dump in two years.  Let me go.  So when you see like a little doggie walking around with like training wheels for his back  legs?  No, he was supposed to die.  He really doesn't want that?  He was supposed to die.  He really doesn't want that?  No.  We are really asses. 
[01:51:00]  The thing is that if he lived, the problem is that he lives in the streets where he would  like starve slowly.  If he was a dog in the wild with no legs, he'd just get torn apart and eat him.  His mother would eat him.  Immediately.  His mom would eat him.  Right out of the womb.  Yeah.  She'd be licking off the placenta and just go, what is it?  Oh, okay.  Oh, I got three puppies and a snack.  Feed it to the rest of them, right?  A snack.  Hey, Middletown, New Jersey chicken and cigars and scotch, of course.  He goes, caterpillars can shape change into butterflies. 
[01:51:30]  Beat that.  It's pretty cool, but I don't see a butterfly really taking over.  It's got to be something that in time can learn to be industrious.  That's why it's creepy.  I don't see.  No, I would say chimpanzees.  No, they're not because they would have done it already.  They would have been competing.  No, because we're around to keep them in check.  We keep the chimps in check.  We absolutely do.  We, we, we, we, most of them are extinct. 
[01:52:00]  The only ones that we have around, we dress in little engineer uniforms because they look  adorable dressed like that, little suspenders, but left to their own devices.  I think they do pretty well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Pat and Bell over time.  Pat.  Hey, what's going on?  I know it's the hack answer, but yeah.  They got thumbs.  What's going on?  I was going to say that actually killer whales have the most powerful brain on the planet.  They can actually literally feel, using their sonar, literally feel everything within 
[01:52:30]  five miles around them.  Right.  So that's, that's pretty impressive.  And I think one of the things you're missing is that you're, uh, Hey, not that impressive  because they're still not walking on land to take a look around as, at least as humans,  we've taken a peek under the water and figured out a way to like, kind of do stuff underwater.  I never see a fish wearing like a big tank of water walking around the beach.  Right.  Like just looking at people.  You know, I got the, would that be great?  I got this powerful brain.  I'm going to do something with it.  That'd be hysterical.  You're just laying, getting some sun and this big fish or something comes out of the water 
[01:53:00]  with a big mask and a tank and it's just pumping water into his gills.  And he's walking around, looking around, kind of poking at you.  It wouldn't be funny if fish were like competition to us.  Like we were doing, like everything the humans are doing would be like, well, the fish, you  know, they still, they just got a wheel.  Yeah.  These guys are idiots.  They're stupid.  Let, let Pat continue.  What, what else, Pat?  Well, I was, I was just saying that, you know, I mean, you're, you know, you're mistaking,  you know, technological development for, for dominance. 
[01:53:30]  I mean, technologically, obviously we're the, we're the best on the planet, but there are  developments with certain primates learning sign language, primates using skills.  It's just that when we were hunter gatherers, wait, wait, wait, slow down with that.  Cause we forced them to do that by shocking them until they learn, shock them.  They learn a sign language out parts of their brain.  Right, right, right.  It's not like they're doing it on their own.  Like we're doing that for our own amusement.  Let's see how smart we can make one of these things. 
[01:54:00]  They're just these little play things.  Yeah.  They're not, they're not doing it on their own.  We're like, there's an electric prod when the TV cameras aren't on and go, Hey, look,  you're going to learn this sign for, for bread or you're going to get shocked again.  Like them in planet of the apes.  The fact that they call like they all, the, the apes ran the town and they called it ape  city.  Yeah.  Like even they're acknowledging that way that isn't this crazy.  That it's like, this is insane.  Look, it's ape city. 
[01:54:30]  That's crazy.  We don't call our country like man America because we think it's weird that we think it's  weird that a man are involved.  Ape law.  Ape law.  Ape law.  Oh, see, it's wild.  It's law, but it's ape law.  We even see it's crazy.  It's nuts.  Look, we're monkeys.  We're not supposed to be in charge.  What were you going to say, Pat?  I said, uh, the only good human is a dead human.  Dead human.  Dead human.  Damn you.  Damn you. 
[01:55:00]  I can't.  Come on, Taylor.  What's on the scrolls, Taylor, when he's trying to get him to recite the scrolls?  What are the third articles of ape law?  I don't know your law.  Man, intelligent.  I don't know your law.  True.  I don't know your law.  There's some kind of brain surgery.  They've taught him to speak.  Oh, damn.  You're upstanding.  You're naked.  The weird thing is in the one where they show how it happened, you know, the conquest of  the planet of the Ape?  Yeah.  Where they show how apes used to be pets and servants? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  It seems like the whole world revolved around ape problems.  Like nobody was, humans aren't any longer doing just regular jobs.  They're just dealing with apes.  And the problems that having apes doing these jobs.  And it's like they drop something.  Ape trouble in sector three.  Ape trouble in sector three.  Constant announcements.  It's more trouble than it's worth.  It's just constant.  And these jackbooted cops that are just about apes.  Just to take care of the apes.  Disperse apes on sector four. 
[01:56:00]  Disperse apes.  Like nobody's running a computer company or like listening to music.  It's just constant ape management.  That's funny.  Ape management.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen.  Let's stay out of Mike in Connecticut.  Mike.  Hey, damn Mike.  Is there a delay on the phones?  Is it our fault today?  Mike.  Why does every person have this?  There's a delay with everybody.  Yeah.  Some kind of problem.  Let's go to Boston, Alex.  Go Pats, Alex. 
[01:56:30]  Go Pats.  It's because of their cell phones, right?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  I got no delay here.  Okay.  What do you got?  I got two things.  I got two things.  You might as well skip feel-good story for the day because nothing tops.  We're all alone and we're all going to die.  The next animal taking over is prairie dogs, man.  The in-depth civilization, predator warning system, communication, they're pretty good.  Wow.  They're getting there, but they don't have prairie TV.  They still, they can't run a company like Blackwater. 
[01:57:00]  Nah.  Not one prairie on some kind of primitive computer.  Nope.  The second we're gone, think of all the apartments and office spaces.  Prairie dogs don't even have those TR7, those old computers.  Yeah.  The old Tandy or Texas Instrument calculator.  I think one of them could have just gone to a dump and at least found a fan and plugged  it in.  Right, right.  To keep cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't even do that.  They can't even take the stuff we don't even want to use anymore and use it for themselves,  which would make their lives better.  Yep. 
[01:57:30]  No, they have no concept.  That's why I would love to see, you know, what would really put it in perspective, have  some unbelievably intelligent alien race come down here and try to teach us tricks that  we just cannot comprehend.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, like they're, they're trying so hard and speaking in some weird language and we're  just stupid.  And they're like, I can't, we can't even teach him to do the guanerbulalur.  Yeah, exactly.  And we, there's some, take electric prod to our side until we did like, I don't know, 
[01:58:00]  figure something out.  We couldn't.  Hey, uh, Duncan Booth, uh, douche from Pittsburgh.  He writes, what about the kangaroo?  It has a, it has a pocket for its money and smokes.  There you go.  It's pretty good.  Kangaroo smoke.  And then someone is talking about the chaos theory with, uh, butterflies.  Can we explain that next?  Maybe what the fluttering of the wings?  Butterflies.  I think that's a rumor.  They're already attacking us.  They can make hurricanes urban myth.  Have you heard of the chaos theory? 
[01:58:30]  So now we got to look up the chaos theory.  You know that some people say, you know the whole thing that Dick Cheney is a lizard.  Yeah.  That's the, that guy, that's your answer.  Dick Cheney.  Dick Cheney is a changeling lizard.  This is like a big, there's, there are many people that believe this.  Seriously.  There's a big, he is a lizard.  That he's part of this lizard people that, that can change into humans, but that he's  a lizard.  Wow.  And that's who's taken over.  All right.  That's kind of cool.  Already, already taken over.  Lizards.  There are people that believe this. 
[01:59:00]  I'm telling you, it's a planet 10 feet away that's full of lizards.  10 feet.  What are they just, camouflage themselves really well?  It's already 30% of us are already these lizards that are right over there.  I love your theory that there might be a planet 10 feet away.  Well, I mean, we're just not looking at it.  I love it.  We're so blind, because like, we keep finding, oh, there's another planet, and Pluto's not  a planet.  Like, there's one right there, and we just keep missing it.  Like, every time people turn over and the planet just moves.  And we just don't have the equipment to pick up.  We just can't look at it.  We just can't look at it.  No, it's like the dark side of the moon. 
[01:59:30]  It's just right there.  And people kind of take just a shuttle spaceship cab over occasionally.  Yeah.  These lizards, they dress like humans.  And we're too busy looking far, far away.  Yes.  It's right under our nose.  So maybe there's already an animal that's getting ready to take over, and they just decided  to disguise themselves as us.  Yes.  Black people.  Like it.  No.  Jesus.  The lizards.  Lizard people.  I was avoiding that for the last hour, by the way, on instant feedback.  I know what the second most. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, Jesus.  And it was every race you can imagine.  It's Opie and Anthony.  If you can imagine.  Hey, we're getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  What an educational show if you're smoking a lot of pot.  It is Pot Talk Monday.  We took advantage of that today.  877-212-ON-A if you learned something from us today.  Louis C.K. playing House of Blues.  Now you got me confused.  House of Blues in Las Vegas on Saturday. 
[02:00:30]  The POWs will be out there.  You'll see a few of them.  The Rainforest Cafe.  Yes.  And, of course, Jim Norton in L.A. for the next few days.  He's doing Jay Leno tonight.  Make sure you take a peek at that.  And he's also doing Chelsea Handler's show.  Oh, he is?  She does a pretty good job with that show.  Look at him.  Oh, it's me.  It's also...  Oh, yeah.  Look, it's Louie.  I see that pop up, and I go, hey, look, it's Louie.  Wait, were you just...  Yeah, I just saw you.  Of course.  I'm at Town Hall on November 8th.  The New York Comedy Festival.  Part of the Comedy Festival.  Always a good time. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Hey, it's also Feel Good Story Monday.  It's Feel Good Story Monday.  Oh!  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Aw.  Do we have a Feel Good Story?  Yeah.  I don't know.  When I was looking through the paper this morning, I didn't see one Feel Good Story.  I got it.  It's right here.  In Orlando, Florida, a Walt Disney World worker faces felony charges after authorities said  he'd made plans to have sex with a minor he met online. 
[02:01:30]  Wait a minute.  This man, Michael Bott Jr., was arrested because, as it turns out, the minor he allegedly planned  to have sex with was a police detective posing as a 14-year-old girl.  So he was a cop.  Police say Bott repeatedly told his chatting buddy that what they were planning was technically  rape.  Police say Bott confessed to the charge when confronted.  He's being held on $20,000 bond.  There you go.  Your Feel Good Story for this Monday.  Wow.  Goofy.  Well, you know, the creep's not going to be doing anything. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  So you can spin anything into a Feel Good Story.  So that's a Feel Good Story?  I thought Feel Good Stories were all Feel Good.  This one was potentially tragic.  Excuse me.  It's making a lot of parents feel good today that this creep's not around anymore.  See?  That's the brilliance of us.  In Orlando.  They can make anything into a Feel Good Story.  They definitely arrested the only child molester in Disneyland.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was an isolated incident.  You'd never, ever see pedos just wandering through there. 
[02:02:30]  You'd never see Goofy with an erection.  No.  He's taking a picture with two four-year-olds.  You know what his face is doing behind that mask?  If you could take the head off, you'd run away.  You don't think that's a Feel Good Story for people out there?  No, I consider Feel Good Stories like a dog comes back to the owner after being lost for  two years because he got dumped out of a car in Arizona. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, even that is depressing.  All right, give me another shot at it.  I'm trying to think of any Feel Good Story to tell you the truth.  I got it.  Because they're all based in tragedy because in order to feel good, there has to be something  bad there that someone overcame.  How about this as your Feel Good Story?  Okay.  Let me see.  You're trying to cry.  What did you say?  It's true that in some situations, disabled children are held back from the normal activities 
[02:03:30]  which others...  So far, so good?  Sounds like they're having fun.  Yeah.  Sounds like they've had some disabled children being given a chance to have some fun.  Yeah, this could be good.  ...from the normal activities which others may get to enjoy.  But for Friendship's special ed teacher and cheerleading sponsor, Casey Ketcher said,  that simply wasn't an option.  If anybody in the school deserves a chance, I feel it's these girls.  She decided that for seven disabled students at the middle school, it was time to shine.  I had one of them the other day tell us that this was her dream her whole life. 
[02:04:00]  I always prayed that I always wanted to be a cheerleader.  Oh, no.  Look at me.  Oh, boy.  They're making them cheerleaders.  But this is what feel-good story Monday is all about, Anthony.  Oh.  What?  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Samantha Hudson has a special honor.  Leading the squad, a dream come true.  I'm a team captain. 
[02:04:30]  And also, I take care of my team and make sure they have fun.  I feel like I can go out there and...  I also like to eat pennies.  They have fun.  I feel like I can go out there and just be myself.  They don't think that they're different, and that's what I love about them is they're ready  to go out there and cheer for tigers, and they don't even think they have a disability. 
[02:05:00]  What?  Here's the thing.  There's nothing wrong with these kids.  These kids have slurred speech.  Yeah, yeah.  They're having a good time cheerleading, and they're not bothering anybody.  But this woman, this young woman, I hate her.  Because actually, the kids doing their cheerleading, that's great.  That's actually great.  But she's like, they don't think that they're different, and that's what I love about them.  Yeah, they don't think that they're different.  We all know they are.  They're not different.  Right.  You're making them different.  The fact that they don't see how hideous they are is so cute. 
[02:05:30]  And R, E, T, A, R, D, retard, retard.  Yay, woo!  Cheer for the tigers, and they don't even think that they have disabilities.  They don't even think.  It's a chance not only to achieve it, but to be a part of that tiger speech.  I want to see your head.  Stop your hands and call me.  Be retarded.  Be retarded. 
[02:06:00]  Be retarded.  I want to see the black retarded cheerleaders.  You know we retarded.  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  We are retarded.  Double time.  Uh-uh.  Retarded.  I show my ass.  I am retarded.  Yeah.  Stop your hands and clap your feet.  Retardation can't be beat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smokezilla, Kentucky.  I think the whole school as a whole is starting to see these girls as being, you know, part 
[02:06:30]  of the heart of Friendship Middle School.  Ketcherson says it's amazing to know that something so simple could provide the girls with the experience  Oh, that they're talking about the kids.  It's just so hard wanting to know that these girls may not ever have this opportunity again,  so it's really important to all of us.  Oh, you self-serving.  Why is George Steinbrenner talking about the Yankees?  Like that.  They are the best retarded cheerleaders in the world.  And Joe Torre is the best manager. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We got an extra chromosome.  How about you?  No?  Wow.  So is that your feel-good story today?  It is a feel-good story.  What's up, man?  Yeah, are they hot?  Cheerleaders are kind of like, yeah, you got to be hot.  Cheerleaders are a very sort of little Nazi organization of hot women. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  And so to try to make the retarded girls...  Y'all ready for this?  Just fall all over each other.  Yeah, they don't do the pyramid.  They just call it the human pile.  They just make an Abu Ghraib-like pile of retarded girls.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Well, we get to meet the cheerleader, some of the cheerleaders here in this next clip. 
[02:08:00]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  That's William.  Oh.  What else does he like besides dresses?  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Yeah.  F fingernail polish.  And this is...  This is why he cheerleads.  I would be happy looking like a woman.  Yeah.  Of course.  I would get rid of all my male clothes and get only girl clothes. 
[02:08:30]  Girl clothes.  I like to make werewolf movies.  That guy's just...  He's my favorite.  He's the best one.  Oh, wow.  These retarded girls are cheerleading, and it's, you know, just something for them to  do before they go work in a box factory.  Oh, my God.  And live in a room where nobody likes them for the rest of their lives.  Oh, my God.  The thing is that only anybody cares about is young, retarded people.  Yeah, true.  Retarded kids go to the Olympics, but when you're a 48-year-old retarded man... 
[02:09:00]  What are you doing?  You don't get any more medals.  No medals coming your way for separating the green glass from the brown glass at the recycling  plant.  That's it.  You know, speaking of glass, we got something.  Yes.  Danny ran in because we forgot about this.  Louie's not that far off.  And actually, you say that.  It could mean...  That's what happens to the star quarterback on half these high school teams.  Like, it's all downhill after high school, no matter what you do.  For the retarded kids, it's really...  What's up, Danny? 
[02:09:30]  Just a side note about that new story about the slow cheerleading squad.  One of the girls on the squad is actually in a wheelchair, and they showed her sitting  in her cheerleading uniform with pom-poms in her wheelchair.  Yeah.  Are any of them hot?  I'm not going to comment on hot, retarded girl.  Well, here's a little commercial for, what, sorting glass?  No, it's...  Well, I don't want to blow it.  All right.  Yeah.  I was trying to be vague, and obviously... 
[02:10:00]  All right.  Clear glass here.  Green there.  Brown there.  I sort glass.  That's my job.  I learned the job slow, and now I know it by heart.  He earns money.  He pays taxes.  He's just like you.  Oh, my God.  ARC, the Association for Retarded Citizens.  Don't throw us away.  What?  Was that an option? 
[02:10:30]  They used to throw them away?  Don't throw us away.  I guess we ought to stop throwing these people away.  All right.  Let them sort glass.  Let them sort glass.  Don't throw me away in the dump.  Just make me work at the dump.  Oh, hell, they're odd to us.  We can't throw them away anymore.  We're throwing you away.  Send them to the glass sorting factory.  That is throwing you away.  He seemed pretty functional, though.  It's just that you're doing something at the dump, but you're still at the dump.  Yeah, you're at the dump.  You've been thrown away.  You have been thrown away. 
[02:11:00]  You've been discarded by a society that doesn't...  You could be working on a farm if they weren't run by corporations.  Hell, they're odd to us.  Did he say it took him kind of a long time to figure out how to sort?  He learned it slow, but now he memorized it.  Yeah, he's got a brown glass.  And you know what?  That sounds like an old commercial.  That guy's homeless now.  Oh, yeah.  There's nothing going on there now.  Like you said...  After they made that commercial, he's like, so I get to stay?  And they're like, no, we're done with the commercial.  Get out of there, you retard.  You're...  You keep getting the brown glass in with the green. 
[02:11:30]  You're worthless.  My balls, my balls are okay.  My balls, my balls, my balls are okay.  Rapping, uh, retarded people.  Isn't this Biz Marky?  No.  Want to thank Louis C.K.  House of Blues Vegas Saturday, right?  That's right.  Friday, Spreckles in San Diego. 
[02:12:00]  Spreckles?  Spreckles Theater.  Did you say freckles or spreckles?  Freckles.  Yes.  My balls, my balls, my balls are okay.  My balls, my balls, my balls are okay.  How much was it there?  This is one cent.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  This is a marble mouth talking about it. 
[02:12:30]  Vanilla Lice.  The retard claim.  It's a hard claim.  It's a hard claim.  It is.  It is.  It's a gold ball. 
[02:13:00]  I'm a sexy boy.  Gold ball.  I'm a sexy boy.  What?  Your balls are low.  My balls, my balls.  Yeah, take us out.  Take us out.  Take us out.  My balls, my balls are okay.  No matter what you say, I know.  When did you sing this, Era?  My balls are okay.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know.  Hey.  Are you fiddling somewhere?  Yeah, I'm fiddling like crazy.  Like the first day we were in here.  Everything's sounding great.  Since then, it just seems a little different.  Yeah, then I don't know what happened. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, you're taking me away?  Why?  What are they?  Oh.  All right.  Ah!  Ow!  I think I found the problem.  Your headphones are up way loud.  Hey, could someone get my screens up?  Oh.  Oh, perfect.  That's what I'm looking at.  All right.  Now we're rocking.  Wow, your headphones suck, man. 
[02:14:30]  That's what it comes down to.  Louis C.K. in studio.  There we go.  Here at XM Satellite Radio, we got a nice crowd that joined us for the walkover.  We don't know what we're going to do as far as broadcasting the walkover.  We don't think we should broadcast it every day because we've run out of crap to do and  say, but we're thinking maybe we broadcast it once a week or something.  I don't know.  We're still trying to fiddle with that idea and figure it out.  Figure out what makes sense.  Yeah.  And Fast Freddy, another great walkover.  What the fuck? 
[02:15:00]  What the fuck?  People are still walking with us every day and then you get to come up and sit on the  bleachers.  Dude, you are a tool.  Oh, I'm sick of people.  I hate people.  You know, they try to do a best of the walkover and make a whole show out of it and then realized,  wow, most of this is shit.  Yeah, it's just people walking from one building to another.  What could possibly be good about that?  Wow, Opie made fun of a homeless guy.  Wow.  I mean, after a while, there's not much you could do with that.  So we're thinking maybe once a week would be kind of cool just to do it, you know, and 
[02:15:30]  then blow our wad once a week.  Yeah.  All right.  Go with it.  Hey, I still want another shot at the feel good story for Monday.  Who fiddled with it?  Huh?  Someone fiddled with it.  With what?  Fiddled with what?  Well, as I recall, last I looked at the pal talk, I was just waking up.  Yeah.  And it was working fine, unfortunately.  And now, like, people fiddled with things, and now the Tom monitor that usually shows  these six various cameras is completely dark and not even attached to anything. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  It's just another thing.  No biggie.  I guess they're seeing something.  Are they?  I have no idea what, but maybe that view?  Let's see.  I don't know.  They're seeing...  Oh, I got to turn on the camera first.  Start webcam.  It takes forever.  Oops.  What just shut off?  That's what they're seeing.  Good one.  They're seeing that?  Yeah.  A couple empty couches? 
[02:16:30]  What just happened to this?  That's great.  Did someone restart that?  Did you restart that?  No.  I hit this button again.  Tell me.  Tell me if you restarted this.  No, I did not restart.  Who restarted it?  I've been with Windows quite a while.  I know they crash.  I know they do funny things.  They never just restart by themselves.  I didn't install anything.  Oh, God.  I hate Windows, by the way.  It's the worst.  Hate Windows.  It's a fake Apple.  I can't... 
[02:17:00]  It always was.  It's turned into just an annoyance for me to even deal with.  The only reason I have it in my house is to play video games on.  Yeah.  Period.  Because I go into the Apple store, and you go into the gaming section and laugh your  ass off.  Oh, that's not fair.  I can get Madden 2007.  I can get Tiger Woods.  I can get Age of Empires 3.  I can get Tiger Woods.  I can get Madden Football.  I can get Age of Empires.  Now, tomorrow, Half-Life 2, Episode 2 is coming out. 
[02:17:30]  Team Fortress 2, which people have been waiting for.  A long time.  10 years.  Wow.  This game, people have been waiting.  And I'm so psyched.  Wait, wait, wait.  What took so long?  You can't just like...  It's fucking Valve and the people that make Half-Life.  For some reason, they think they're the band Boston.  They put games out like they put out fucking albums.  So, yeah, I'm really psyched for this one.  And they don't run on a Mac. 
[02:18:00]  So, it's my Windows.  But that's all I use it for now.  Everything else, I got a Mac with a 30-inch display.  Yeah, with a Mac, you can actually make a movie.  Yeah, you can make a movie with it.  All of my software that I was using versions of on Windows,  that would crash every five minutes.  You'd have to be like, save, save, save.  Because God forbid you went five minutes without saving,  and it crashes.  Now you've got to redo everything you did.  Sure.  The Mac just doesn't fucking crash like that.  No, it's a great machine.  It really is.  I'm not doing a commercial for it here, either. 
[02:18:30]  It's just the way it is.  Oh, Louie.  Windows sucks ass.  Yeah, I've got to interrupt.  Louie, don't put your feet up.  I know.  I've already been feeling.  That could lead to a major problem.  Let me show everyone the position never to take.  Here it is.  Do we have a microphone on out there so we get some sound from the audience there?  Never pull your mic way over here.  Right.  Never lean back in these comfy new chairs.  Do you feel how comfy these are?  Yeah, no, they're really nice.  And never, never do this. 
[02:19:00]  No.  All right.  And here it was.  Okay, let me see if I can reenact the pose.  That's how I ended up.  They're all laughing out there.  Just done.  We haven't mic'd the audience yet, but they're laughing.  They're laughing at you.  How was your neck, by the way?  It was killing me.  I could imagine.  Oh, like a $5 hooker.  Right.  My neck was like...  No, I'm sleepy, too.  I couldn't get into...  I tried...  I went to bed at 9 p.m. last night, but I couldn't...  It doesn't matter.  I've learned it really doesn't matter what time you go to bed. 
[02:19:30]  I said I could go to bed at 4 in the afternoon.  When I wake up at 4 in the morning, I'm going to yawn and go, holy shit, I'm exhausted, tired.  It doesn't matter.  It's very true.  There's a big difference between 4 and noon.  Like, if you went to bed at midnight and had to get up at noon, you'd be fucking zippity-doo-dying out of bed.  It wouldn't be a problem.  It's fucking noon.  But there's something about even 12 hours sleep, getting up at that hour, it's not meant for humans anymore.  Maybe when we were farmers and there was no electricity and stuff, 4 in the morning was great. 
[02:20:00]  You have your big breakfast, you get out in the field.  But now, no.  Sorry.  No.  There's a reason there's no roosters in New York City.  Yeah.  Yeah, we killed those fuckers a long time ago.  Just the fuck up.  Hey, a little observation.  Louis C.K. is a wonderful father.  I am a good dad, I guess.  You trash your wife, you trash your kids, over the years, doing the show with us.  Over the years, probably the last year or so. 
[02:20:30]  It's rare I call a man adorable.  Right.  Louis, you are adorable.  We were privy to a nice conversation Louis was having with his daughter about Thunder.  Yeah.  Thunder's a black gentleman that she's dating.  And we had to be asses in the background, and you were kind of giggling, but like, look,  dude, chill, man.  This is my daughter.  This is what I do.  It's not being a dash.  Because you were basically telling her that Thunder can't kill you, and we're like, yeah, 
[02:21:00]  but the lightning can't.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah.  He's explaining, yeah, because she was scared of the Thunder.  No, she called, my wife called me, and I got the, during a break, I got the message.  She said, call if you can, because it's the Thunderstorm, and she's hysterical.  Which I think is kind of funny that she's with your daughter, but she wants to talk to  Daddy about the Thunder.  Yes, she wants Daddy.  Like, Mommy can't calm her down?  I don't, I think my wife maybe doesn't ground fears, maybe, as well as I do.  Like, she does it for me. 
[02:21:30]  She does it for, yeah, she does it for me.  Like, she can ground my fears.  Yeah.  But not for the kids, for some reason, they share anxieties, I think.  So, she wants to hear a male, you know, rumbly voice saying, it's okay, it's just, thunder  can't hurt you, and also, it moves fast, moves quickly over.  Yeah, yeah, I heard you explaining the thunderstorms.  Thunderstorms always move quickly, they don't.  And why was she concerned that the Thunder was going to come to New York?  Well, apparently they're upstate.  They're upstate right now, and they're driving to New York today, so she's thinking the Thunder  is going to, and it is. 
[02:22:00]  It's going to follow her.  Thunder, so I had to tell her.  And he said that.  I couldn't tell her, no, there's not going to be any Thunder here when you get here, because  there will be.  Right.  So, I can't lose that credibility.  I can't.  Yeah.  So, I said, yeah, there probably will be Thunder when you get here.  But it moves very fast.  But it'll move as quickly.  Didn't you notice that it moved quickly today over here?  All of a sudden, you turned into a weatherman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, let me tell you, baby, the low-pressure system is moving out of our area.  A high is moving in from Canada, which will bring cooler temperatures.  No, and then I started telling her about when I was afraid of Thunder, even recently. 
[02:22:30]  And it was because I didn't know why it was so...  I was in Austin, Texas, visiting my sister.  And they put me in their guest room, which was like this corner room with big windows.  And out of nowhere, thunder, hail, fucking wind.  It was crazy.  And I was like, we're all going to die.  This is the worst thing that ever happened in the world.  The weather's going to kill me.  I've never seen it before.  The windows are getting cracked by hailstones.  And he's explained this to his daughter.  And I told my daughter this story. 
[02:23:00]  And then I went and I woke my sister and her husband up and said, there's a shelter, right?  We're all going to the local high school.  I'm going to be wearing an army blanket in about five minutes.  The authority's going to take care of us, right?  Yeah, the National Guard is on the way here.  You tell this story to your daughter and you go, and I was 35.  I was 35.  Yeah, she doesn't even know what number 35 is yet.  But I'm like, I was 35 years old and I was scared out of my mind.  Because I didn't know.  And then my sister told me, oh, it's like this every night.  And after that, I experienced the same thing every night.  And I didn't care. 
[02:23:30]  And they went back to bed and they looked at each other and went, oh my God, this is the  worst fucking storm.  I think the roof's going to blow up.  Exactly.  You were yelling for your daddy and your mommy that night.  So she's okay now?  She's fine.  And I think it's, you know, she's scared by thunder because it thrills her, I think.  I think she's a very sensitive kid.  So she's really, thunder is really dramatic and cool.  Have you told her what she has?  I don't want to take that even away from her that much.  Have you told her what she really has to worry about?  Arabs, planes flying into buildings. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  You know, honey, don't worry because we're destroying your planet anyway.  Yeah.  We're wrecking it for you.  Yeah, don't worry.  Imagine if there's a parent out there that takes that approach.  You don't have to worry about thunder.  What you really need to worry about is that pretty much the rest of the world is trying  to figure out a way to set off a nuclear weapon in the middle of Manhattan.  That's what you should be worried about.  Another religion and dark forces that don't believe in human rights.  And if they had it their way, they would get a dirty bomb into this city.  That's what you should be worried about, sweetie. 
[02:24:30]  Not dirty clouds, dirty bombs is what you should be worried about.  I've never seen Anthony sit straighter in my life.  Are you trying to make an impression today?  I'm trying to make an impression.  You're like...  I don't want to fall asleep.  I'm working on, I'm trying to get Pal Talk running.  I think I got a camera, but it's a rug that says the Opie and Anthony show.  That's pretty much what they're getting.  But your back is...  Millions of dollars of technology.  Your back is straight as a board. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, yes.  You're at full attention here today.  I'm going to drink a nice sugary smoothie.  Mmm.  Yeah, I don't want to be falling asleep.  Hey, do we have that, the feel good story sweeper?  Because I want to attempt this again.  Okay.  Do we have that, or is that the other joint?  Because we don't.  We have Monday's production there, E-Rock?  E-Rock-tober, everybody.  E-Rock-tober.  Oh, they're screaming out there.  Wait.  Take two. 
[02:25:30]  E-Rock-tober, everybody.  Wow.  I got a nice crowd out there.  Yeah.  And he's doing nothing.  He's looking for a disc.  He's panicking.  He's here somewhere.  He's...  What?  It was new today, buddy.  You know what the, one of the funniest things I saw today with E-Rock was when Ope came  in, and the worst of, or best of, whatever you want to call it, is playing between the  two shows.  And Ope goes, who chose this? 
[02:26:00]  Now, E-Rock didn't want to commit to it, not knowing that Opie was actually going to compliment  I was trying to give a compliment.  Whoever, whoever, I did it.  I noticed that.  So Eric's like, um, uh...  Boy, I noticed that because I thought the same thing when he said, who chose the stuff  that goes on before we came here?  And I thought, hmm, is he upset?  Yeah.  Someone's going to get...  Someone's about to get, you know...  Boy, that's how everyone else was.  That's how Eric was like, oh, I know it was me, but now I got to say it's me.  That doesn't say a lot for me, you know?  They have to go into defense mode. 
[02:26:30]  No, it's good.  I thought it was really smart because they picked the Louis C.K. thing, and there are  dummies out there that just figured that the show continued and that we didn't take a  break, and that was live today.  Yep.  And that's why I say, that's brilliant.  Exactly.  So he finally fessed up to it, and then Ope goes, yeah, that's a good idea to keep the  theme going.  And he goes, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course.  You know, that was me.  That's how I fucking roll, Ope.  That made me laugh.  All right, we don't have the sweeper, but I'm going to attempt the feel-good story again.  Uh, for today. 
[02:27:00]  We need one good, feel-good story, so let's try this one.  Okay.  Or maybe not.  You got to read through the season.  This is the McDonald's at 7th and Broadway, where Monday, a 20-year-old described as an  employee here had a baby in the bathroom.  I'll see if everybody's running through their own bathroom.  It's definitely no.  So far, so good, right?  For a feel-good story Monday.  Somebody had a baby in a bathroom, yeah.  What's wrong?  You know, that's good, right?  It was baby, like a Christmas story.  The circle of life.  Yeah, circle of life.  Playing out at that, uh, McDonald's in the bathroom. 
[02:27:30]  There you go.  There's your feel-good story for Monday.  That's where you want to happen.  If we stop here.  Okay.  If we stop here.  Something tells me it's going to go horribly awry.  The baby's going to be drinking ammonia in a second.  I just kept walking.  I don't want to be involved in none of that, but I didn't know somebody was in there having  a baby.  It turns out...  I gave the man UPS.  UPS.  UPS.  This customer knows the employee that, according to this police report, told paramedics, she  then tried to flush three times.  Wow.  That's bad. 
[02:28:00]  Masked workers are credited for taking the baby boy...  That's all they could get is a comment from somebody.  Man, that's bad.  Man.  I think it's a little more than bad.  Out of the toilet and doing CPR, they say he was not breathing and had no pulse.  All this happening at the end of the busy lunch hour here.  Yeah.  Every year that kid is going to have a almost flush down the toilet day.  Instead of a birthday.  The mother was taken from the restaurant to Truman Medicine. 
[02:28:30]  I was laughing and stuff.  It was spicy.  Did she ever talk about being pregnant?  No.  This police report also has paramedics saying she told them she didn't know that she was  pregnant, but investigators looking into what happened here say they have information  indicating the McDonald's employee told others about her pregnancy.  Now, we reached that woman today.  She's still at TNC.  She did not want to talk.  No one at the restaurant.  None of the employees is talking.  Either the baby born at 32 weeks is here, is expected to survive in child services, now 
[02:29:00]  has custody of that baby boy.  Hmm.  She didn't know.  She thought that she was taking a baby-shaped shit out of her cunt.  That's what she thought it was.  That's what she was trying to flush it like a good employee.  Three times.  She was trying to flush and then wash her hands and go back to work.  Three fucking times and couldn't get it down?  She thought she took a fleshy shit out of her vagina.  All right, well, is that the feel-good story? 
[02:29:30]  She had a fucking look at that.  She probably eats the McDonald's every day.  Yeah.  If you eat that shit every day, you will shit a baby out of your twat.  That's how bad that food is for you.  All right, that's not a good feel-good story.  It's very binding.  I don't think it's feel-good.  All right, I'm trying.  I think it's funny.  All right, I'll try here.  Let's keep trying.  We need one good feel-good story for this one.  It's got to warm the cockles.  The cockles.  What is a cockle?  A cockle.  Where is the cockle?  It's part of the heart.  You got to, it's a.  Isn't it warm all the time then? 
[02:30:00]  I think so.  All right.  He had his gun out.  How about this?  I ain't never been in that situation before, so I took off.  Fifteen-year-old Mark Atkins is now facing several charges after taking a joyride in a stolen car  and getting into a short pursuit with police in southwest Oklahoma City.  But along with the charges, he's now facing an uphill battle with his health after being  captured by a canine officer that tore away flesh along with his scrotum.  Oh!  That's a feel-good story.  Along with his scrotum. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, we almost there?  And oh, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  His ball bag.  Some of that flesh was his scrotum.  Wow.  Yeah, I got to hear that again.  He just casually throws in and, oh, yeah.  The dog ripped off his scrotum and starts chewing it like bubble gum.  They didn't need to tell us.  That's not newsworthy.  Right.  The fact that it was his balls was not newsworthy.  Right, right.  Leather chew toy.  That was just a little throw-in.  Yeah.  Battle with his health after being captured by a canine officer that tore away flesh along  with his scrotum.  Along with his scrotum.  All right, Joey, give us another read on along with his scrotum. 
[02:31:00]  A little more dramatic.  Along with his scrotum.  Now, make it a little more dark.  Along with his scrotum.  That's perfect.  Circle that take.  That was good.  How many along with his scrotum takes do you think he has?  I want to hear that take.  Along with his scrotum.  No, no, no, no.  You're not getting the essence of along with his scrotum.  No, because the first one was tore away his flesh along with his scrotum.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Just glance over that, baby. 
[02:31:30]  You got to slow down a little bit.  Slow down on the scrotum.  There's a yield here.  You got to slow down a little bit.  How many stories have you read with along with his scrotum this week?  Right, right.  Don't you fucking know when to pause?  It's drama, motherfucker.  Try again.  Let's go.  Tapes rolling.  Along with his scrotum.  It sounds like you're, it's like the weather or something.  Along with, ooh, his scrotum.  Someone is pointing out love is fake voice.  Yeah.  If you can't get up for a scrotum ripping story, then you don't belong in the business. 
[02:32:00]  All right, more to the story.  Doctors tell me, I didn't think, they didn't think they were going to be able to stitch me back together.  He was in the trauma for seven to nine days.  And it was, I just never seen him being like.  Wouldn't you be in trauma for the rest of your life, more or less?  I mean, nine days.  For a few days, I felt amazing.  Right.  Nine days, I'm like, ah, fucking scrotum bloatum.  Who needs a scrotum anyway?  Fucking dog bit my ball bag off, but yeah, it's nine days ago. 
[02:32:30]  Ah, you move on.  Who gives a shit?  It looks like a deflated balloon now.  Yeah.  Ah, who cares?  Who gives a shit?  I don't need that.  I fisted on to a minor.  Obviously, they're not trained to bite in this particular area of the body.  Officers say Mark was not handcuffed when the dog attacked,  and claimed the animal was just doing what it was trained to do.  We had the officer on top of the individual.  They're on the ground.  The guy's resisting.  The dog is trying to assist his handler with this aggressive behavior as best he can.  I can't explain how painful it was, but it's like being tied up and eating a lie. 
[02:33:00]  Mark says he was no longer resisting.  His mother now hopes legal action will help the police admit they were wrong.  There are some good officers out there, and there are some bad ones, you know.  But I think in order to clean it up, they need to let these officers take responsibility for what they do to the public.  I got something to add to that statement.  There's some good kids out there, and there's some bad kids.  That's right.  They deserve a dog ripping their scrotum.  The good ones get to walk away with their balls.  Right.  Sometimes the bad ones don't. 
[02:33:30]  That's all she's got.  There's bad cops, good cops.  How about there's bad kids?  That kid was bagging groceries, saving money for his college fund.  A dog would never in his life get off his scrotum.  Right.  All right.  I'm on a mission.  We got to find just one good, feel-good story for today, Monday.  Got to find.  That one was great.  Is that a good, feel-good story, you think?  Made me feel good.  I feel pretty good.  I left.  Do you guys feel good?  No?  Is there a mic off?  They're in a soundproof booth. 
[02:34:00]  What happened?  I feel better than I did before the story.  All right.  Let me try another one.  I can't believe, also, while you're looking.  Yeah.  The one Paltalk camera I have control of is the worst camera in the whole place.  All I can get is a black leather chair.  It's in there, so I can't even get the audience because it hits the TVs.  It doesn't go down low enough.  It's too close to the TVs.  Mm-hmm.  And I can't get us.  I can only get a chair or the Opie and Anthony or the Ron and Fez carpet. 
[02:34:30]  Do the Ron and Fez carpet.  All right.  They can use the promotion.  Sure.  There you go.  That's what you get today.  Well, we'll have to figure that out.  Now, we need one of these feel-good stories to bring everyone together.  Like, you feel good, but the crowd out there, they're shaking their head.  They're like, no, I don't feel good after that story.  So let's try another one here.  Feel-good story Monday.  You ready yet?  Ready.  All right.  Here's the next one.  Let's see if this is the one that brings everyone together.  Police are looking for a driver in a deadly hit and run.  Yeah, but they're also looking for some thieves who ripped off the victim as he lay bleeding 
[02:35:00]  and dying on the sidewalk.  It's an unbelievable story.  Oh, that's awesome.  That's fun.  Oh, look at that.  What happened to that guy?  Take his wallet.  Oh, my God.  That guy just got hit by a car 10 seconds ago.  Take his watch.  I wish it was that, because he would almost understand if it was his wallet, his whatever.  All right.  What did they take?  Money.  Thieves who ripped off the victim as he lay bleeding and dying on the sidewalk. 
[02:35:30]  It's an unbelievable story.  Here's some video from the scene near Maine and Horn in Mesa.  Police tell us the man happened to be waiting for a bus with his groceries in hand when an  out-of-control truck hit him and killed him.  Instead of helping the man, people nearby started stealing his groceries.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you've got to be shitting me.  He's got organic eggs.  Right.  He's got bloomeries.  That's a perfectly good cantaloupe.  He's got bloomeries. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, it's not his wallet with his money and his credit cards.  It's stupid groceries.  Oh, my God.  Instead of helping the man, people nearby started stealing his groceries.  They made off with them, and the truck driver now faces felony charges.  If caught, he also took off.  The people who stole those groceries could also face theft charges as well.  Oh, boy.  That's a biggie.  That theft charge is a biggie, man.  Grand Theft Lemon.  Is that a good field of story? 
[02:36:30]  Oh, God.  What were they saying out there?  Nothing.  I think I'm zooming in on.  You guys are the camera working.  There we go.  I got one more camera working.  There we go.  It's like Apollo 13 in here.  Yeah, no kidding.  Got to keep just holding shit together with duct tape.  Not smart on XM's part, by the way, because you're dealing with guys that have ADD to begin with.  So what do you do?  You throw a bunch of shiny new toys in front of them.  New things.  Joysticks and cameras.  It's like, oh, yeah, we're supposed to do a radio show. 
[02:37:00]  I forgot about the radio show for a second.  Right.  Is that your feel-good story?  I don't feel good about that.  No.  No?  That's not a good one.  Yeah, the poor bastard.  All right, how about, uh, all right, I'm going to try two more.  Maybe, maybe one more.  We'll try this for your feel-good story for this Monday.  I put Cromwell on the camera.  Stupid Cromwell.  Cromwell's on cam.  A name I like to say. 
[02:37:30]  He's the only one I could get on camera through the, like, slot in the door.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  He walks into FH.  I go, hello, Cromwell.  Stupid Cromwell.  I think it's some abuse.  Pick a worse name in the ONA community than Cromwell.  Even Flea is, you know, whatever, Flea.  But Cromwell.  That's his first name?  Flea?  No, Cromwell.  He's right there. 
[02:38:00]  That's his first name?  That's his handle.  That's his handle.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I like Cromwell.  All right, here's another feel-good story.  Let's try another one here.  Well, there's quite a delay in that fucking thing, huh?  Yes.  Police describe it as bottom of the barrel.  Surveillance tape rolls as a toddler is forced to steal at a boardwalk arcade in Seaside Heights.  The real-life case has a lot of parallels to Oliver Twist.  Watch as the woman sets down a little girl at Lucky Leo's arcade and kicks her under a swing gate below a glass counter. 
[02:38:30]  The child then grabs an employee's purse.  The purse had approximately $165 in cash.  It was a coach purse and had numerous credit cards in there.  If this woman can do this to this child now to use the innocence of a child to commit a crime, it's much easier for that woman to purvey this child to do more crimes.  Police right now are working on leads.  They say an arrest is imminent.  That was very poorly stated.  Poorly worded.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  If it was easy for her to use the child's innocence to do this, then it will be easy for her...  Oh, never mind.  In the future to...  Oh, forget it.  I...  Oh, forget it.  It's a...  It's bad.  Hey, we got a tattletale on, uh, and some feedback.  A rat?  Save my upstick from Whackbag.  He writes, oh, by the way, Cromwell said he could last 30 seconds with Poe.  Really, Cromwell?  Wait, he's nodding to that.  Yeah?  What do you mean that he, in a fight, he could last for 30 seconds? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Cromwell.  Get a mic on Cromwell.  There goes Danny.  You could last...  Based on...  Oh, that mic sounds great.  The rules that you had last week.  Back up a little.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was Joe's lead singer, I think, who wrestled Poe.  Yeah.  He lasted for 30 seconds.  Yeah.  I think I could last 30 seconds with Poe, wrestling.  Do you wrestle?  I did wrestle.  Karate crumbs.  Karate crumbs. 
[02:40:00]  What does that mean?  Good one.  Cromwell.  Yeah, you think you could 30 seconds with Poe.  You know, based on those rules, which is no eye gouging, no choking out, no...  Well, we need a new waiver, man, for these listeners.  No choking out.  They have to sign their life away.  Basic wrestling.  Basic wrestling.  Yeah, Poe has said he's not a wrestler.  Wait, but that wasn't the...  He's a murderer.  That wasn't the bit.  The guy who's wrestling moves on Poe, Poe was still able to do whatever he wanted. 
[02:40:30]  Poe didn't turn into a wrestler all of a sudden.  There's Poe now.  Gentlemen.  In that case, maybe a little less than 30 seconds.  Yeah, Poe doesn't wrestle.  He just got confused by the guy that had some wrestling techniques, that's all.  Poe's like the guy that if gunmen enter a bank, Poe could take a pen and kill them all.  Mm-hmm.  With nothing more than a pen.  Mm-mm, this one.  So he can't just...  He's not a wrestler, but I think he'll still tie up and make a tap out. 
[02:41:00]  In less than 30 seconds.  Yeah.  30 seconds is a long time.  Yeah.  No, not really.  To be with...  Oh, to be in that guy.  That guy.  Awful hold, yeah.  Yeah, but Poe could take him out and like...  I say Poe could take Cromwell...  Poe could take Cromwell out in 28 seconds.  Mm-hmm.  Poe could get your arm in that position where you just go, all right, all right, all right.  Like, you're thinking, wow, I think I really got this guy.  I think I could...  Okay, all right, all right.  Yeah, nobody wants their limbs to actually break. 
[02:41:30]  No.  Let's play, let's play like a version of Name That Tune with Cromwell.  I say Poe takes him out in 28 seconds.  All right.  29.  No, you can't go the other way.  No, I'm going to go the one.  I hate those people.  All right, this is the last attempt at the feel-good story for this Monday, all right?  It is a medical mistake that is hard to imagine.  A woman goes through a painful double mastectomy believing she had cancer. 
[02:42:00]  But that diagnosis was entirely wrong, and now that woman is suing.  I just...  I thought they were going to say, but now that woman is flat-chested.  Suing.  She better get more than $11.5 million for that, right?  Yeah, because I would think so.  That, to me, is a lot worse than someone calling you a bitch at work.  I would say so, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Now that woman is suing.  I just broke down in pride, and I really didn't know what happened in the room from that point on.  News Derry Eason says she couldn't even believe. 
[02:42:30]  The doctor told her she didn't have breast cancer, but it was too late, weeks after she had a double mastectomy.  The good news is your breasts are not cancerous.  The bad news is that they're in a bucket in the hospital waste dump.  And it's too late.  They're mixed in with other people's uncancerous breasts.  Yeah, we really can't reattach them at this point.  Yeah, that's not going to work.  Seems like you get these stories from time to time where they take the wrong leg off, the wrong arm. 
[02:43:00]  Some patients have taken to writing on their own legs.  Yeah.  Like on their own leg.  This is the bad one.  Yeah, bad leg.  This one's got to go.  She should have written, please make sure they have cancer before you fucking scoop them out.  Double check.  By the way, now Cromwell's getting some advice.  Smokezilla writes, sweep the leg, Cromwell.  Sweep the leg.  Sweep the leg, Cromwell. 
[02:43:30]  And someone else saying that you do sound like a Cromwell.  Here's more to the story.  It just hit me that all the things that I had gone through, my family, my child, that it was unnecessary.  Her life was changed forever.  She says it happened after the lab made a horrible mistake.  They mixed up her report with someone else's.  Now she's suing the medical lab in Rybrook, CBL Path.  In spite of the best efforts, these things happen. 
[02:44:00]  But I don't understand that.  A state report blames the mix-up on a technician at the lab.  He admitted to cutting corners when labeling the specimen.  Oh, boy.  He just wrote, he wrote lady.  He wrote some lady's tits.  And they got mixed up with some other lady's tits.  It was what the other, the other label said some other lady's tits.  Yeah.  It's just cutting some corners.  Yeah.  And you're getting to the obvious. 
[02:44:30]  There is a second victim.  Oh.  Well, because there's a mix-up.  There's a lady whose fucking breasts are...  Some lady's got black breasts.  Right.  And she thinks she's fine.  Oh, she got some great news.  And then...  And some other lady's got cauliflower on her nipples.  Okay.  She was told that she's fine a week ago.  Here's the second victim to the story.  There's a second victim.  Yeah.  The woman whose information got switched with Jerry's.  That woman was apparently told she didn't have cancer.  But found out much later that, in fact, she did. 
[02:45:00]  I hope no one ever has to go through that.  I hope nobody ever has to deal with that.  Because you can't explain it to a person and have them understand unless they've been through it.  And I hope no one ever has to go through this.  Now, the attorney isn't saying how much money they're asking for.  And the technician, by the way, who made that mistake in the first place, well, they no longer work for the company.  Really?  I thought he got a...  I thought he got a promotion. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, I guess everything's fine then.  Sounded like a great employee.  Yeah.  What is that?  He has the old squeaky mic.  I thought it was a dog barking in the background.  All right.  We got...  We have a lot of, like, stuff that we haven't got to in a long time, so...  Yeah.  It's time to clean house.  This isn't a bad idea. 
[02:46:00]  In search of your feel-good story.  Yeah.  I don't think that was it either.  Both people lost.  It wasn't like the other woman, you know, learned that she didn't have cancer and saved her boobs.  Right.  You know?  At the last minute.  Right when they were ready to slice.  Why did he tell her is the thing?  Why did the doctor tell her?  Yeah.  Just did...  Because he must have been like, I can't wait to see the look on her fucking face.  Why tell her?  That it was unnecessary. 
[02:46:30]  At that point, why would you tell her?  Why bother telling her?  Just go, hey, looks like the operation went perfectly.  Wow.  It's looking good.  And now your perfectly healthy breasts are gone.  And you're looking great.  I'd say your chance of any type of cancer reoccurring is zero.  Right.  We beat it back.  All right.  You're welcome.  Here's something crazy that happened to a senior citizen.  It was just basically a misdemeanor shot.  Twenty-five dollars' worth of candy from a safe way. 
[02:47:00]  Officers came to the governor's park retirement community to question a man in his late 60s.  Police say the man met them at the door with a handgun.  Fired four to five shots.  Jeez.  Hello.  And a Windsor police officer in his protective vest.  Another round hit his lower body.  Like a pop pop, but not like a boom.  We did have one officer who did return shots.  That's when we brought everybody inside the house.  And then within five minutes, everybody showed up.  And then they all were cocking their guns. 
[02:47:30]  And they ran by and said, get in your houses, get in your houses.  He just started firing.  He stole 25 lousy dollars of candy.  And then they go to the retirement home to question him.  And he shot a cop.  He's a cop killer.  Over stealing candy.  A flashback.  Listen to what happens, though.  For three hours, SWAT teams maneuvered around the neighborhood.  They have attempted negotiations, but at this point, there's been no response. 
[02:48:00]  So he's like a SWAT team robot with a camera told them why.  The suspect lay dead inside his home, perhaps injured in the initial exchange of fire.  He was my neighbor.  Joe Harris knew his eccentric neighbor as Ed.  Right.  Centric.  Harris says his neighbor was a loner.  Different.  Like to brag about his gun collection.  In fact, Harris says his neighbor came by his apartment early in the afternoon,  wanted to talk about some issues he was having.  Harris says Ed stormed out when another neighbor interrupted their conversation. 
[02:48:30]  I didn't get a chance to find out what was troubling me.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's just one of those crazy old guys that decided...  The guy at the end should say,  and none of the people in this story matter.  Let's go to Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne, what's up?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  No, I've got all the buttons down.  Corinne. 
[02:49:00]  That sounds like a button thing, though.  Yellow.  Kind of weird.  Like, we came here that first day, and everything was just working perfectly.  Everything worked fine.  And there's been a drastic drop-off in the last couple days.  It's been a half-life of a day.  Ah, she had a good story, too.  She was told she didn't have cancer when she did, and she lost her boobs.  Wow.  So she can relate to that story we just played, but we can't get the phones working.  Well, let me see if it was just her.  Let's say hi to Thomas.  Thomas.  Thomas. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, the phones aren't working.  Great.  Oh.  Hello.  Thomas.  Hello.  Thomas.  He's saying hello, because it sounds like...  Hello.  Hello.  Thomas.  Hello.  Hello.  We can hear him.  He can't hear us.  Thomas.  Click.  He hung up.  And now Quinn's calling back.  Frustration.  It wasn't my fault, she's saying.  Of course it wasn't.  We can't go to her, because the phone...  It's not a button thing?  Not a button here thing. 
[02:50:00]  No?  Yeah, nothing's working.  I knew a woman who had breast cancer, and she didn't have...  She had small tits, and so she took the opportunity to put in big, porny ones.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because they got to put something...  They scoop out the breast meat, and then they put bags in there.  Scoop it out.  That's what they do.  They basically use a grapefruit spoon, and they scoop it out.  And then what do they do about a nipple?  A nipple?  I don't know what they do.  If it's like...  I don't think the nipple has cancer. 
[02:50:30]  I think it's just the meat inside the breast.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Fatty, fatty meat.  Because I heard they have to tattoo one on or something.  Oh, really?  I could draw one on with a Sharpie.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break, so hopefully we'll figure out these phones.  Tell Corinna, you know, stand by until the end of the break.  Yeah, take a break, and we'll fix all this shit.  All right, it's...  God damn it.  I don't want to take this phone call.  Hold on the line, everybody, on the phone.  Thank you.  All right.  Louis C.K. playing House of Blues Vegas this Saturday for the Piss Out West, and we'll continue 
[02:51:00]  in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Get infected.  All right, we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Louis C.K. in studio.  Let's not forget, Jim Norton on Jay Leno tonight.  Make sure you take a peek at that.  We'll play his appearance on our show tomorrow as well. 
[02:51:30]  Cromwell.  Yeah, Smokezilla from Whackbag.  He writes, is Cromwell oiling up for the big match with Master Poe?  And then you got, well, Pat from Monaki.  Cromwell will use the...  You can't hit me.  I'm wearing glasses.  All right, we're going to try the phones again.  Do we know if they're working?  We should.  All right, let's say hi to Corinne.  Corinne.  Yeah.  Guys, if you have me on, I can't hear you.  Corinne.  Hi. 
[02:52:00]  Hi, Corinne.  Hi, can you hear us?  Shout out the window, Ed.  You just feel like yelling.  Hey, hey.  Corinne.  Corinne.  Can you hear us, please?  Answer.  I really thought after XM, you know, pumped about a million dollars into this place.  Guys, I can't hear you at all.  That things would be a little different.  You would think.  I was crazy to think that things would be different after spending a million dollars.  And since it did work the first day, they must have had this just the first day.  This is so fundamental.  Like, they can't do what Alan Freed was able to do. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  He just fucking had taken callers after playing James Brown's newest record.  Yeah.  So we don't have no trouble.  We don't have phones today.  Is your mouse working?  Uh, no.  The mouse doesn't work for PalTalk.  We don't have Wi-Fi today.  What else don't we have, Ben?  I only have two cameras.  What the hell's going on?  The problem was that, uh, apparently over the weekend there was a power outage.  Yeah.  So we're still trying to work the bugs out of all the equipment that had to be reset and  all that stuff.  Uh.  Yeah.  That was the weekend?  Yeah.  Apparently. 
[02:53:00]  So, why?  It's now Monday and it's still fucked up.  I think people didn't know until early this morning and they've been working on it since  six.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Danny, which one do you think is the feel-good story for today?  Uh, what are my choices?  I think the studio here.  I would have power outages upstate and just, you know, you might just turn everything back  on.  Warm milk.  It just comes back on.  But, yeah.  Yeah, that's about it.  It just comes back on.  It just comes back on and it's the way you left it.  Yeah.  It's all.  Oh, all right.  I got, I got.  The digital clock is off by, you know, it may be blinking 12 o'clock. 
[02:53:30]  But you fixed that.  Yeah, it's easy enough.  Couple of buttons.  Uh, Corinne has a great story and we can't get to her, so I don't know.  Maybe she could type it out or something, email it to us.  That's a good one.  That's a good one?  All right.  We're going to attempt another feel-good story here, okay?  All right.  Louie, do not yawn.  Today is not the day to yawn in here.  Louie's feeling the chair, man.  These chairs have to go.  These are bad chairs. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Another feel-good story for this Monday.  Yeah.  Here, Brian Neal Rosen.  And this doesn't work right.  It doesn't, yeah.  It's not, to get technical, it doesn't queue up when you put the CD in for whatever reason.  Yeah.  What's that about?  Bad.  There's a lot of little bugs in here.  That was working the first- everything was working the first day.  Mars is having a panic attack.  You all right, Mars?  I'm getting better. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  Yeah, our phones, though.  Because now watch what happens when you do this.  Here, Brian-  Well, it worked that time.  Now it worked.  It was different.  It's only when you first put it in, it doesn't automatically go to the first track.  When you first put it in and press the button, it won't go.  As soon as you put it in, you've got to start it up.  Yeah.  Hit fast forward.  Fast forward.  How's mother?  I wouldn't know.  All right.  Here, Brian Neal Rosema pulled from a house and hauled off to jail.  He's charged with more than 100 counts of child pornography in a shocking and disgusting crime. 
[02:55:00]  One week ago, Rosema entered this Walmart in West Melbourne, and police say used a self-help photo kiosk to print 140 photos depicting child pornography and molestation of a child under the age of 12.  After the final photo was done, police say Rosema left, unaware that the printer had simply run out of paper.  When an employee restocked the paper, more lube photos fell out, and that's when Walmart called police. 
[02:55:30]  He goes to Walmart to print out freaking kiddie porn bags.  They got great prices.  They got great prices.  Walmart is awesome.  Even if you're printing children with your dick in their ass.  Don't these people realize?  It's very good prices.  Don't they realize that's a crime?  Well, how could it be a crime when it feels so good?  You might as well just print up some prototype money and go there and go, could you just keep printing these and I'll be back? 
[02:56:00]  So there's a big pile of counterfeit hundreds.  Yeah, no.  It's a crime.  Child molesters are so flagrant.  They're so bad.  Yeah, they're horrible.  Really, the only truth could be that fucking kids is awesome.  Because people risk their freedom.  They risk their everything.  Their family, friends, freedom.  All the guys that go on whatever that show is, the Predator show. 
[02:56:30]  Predator.  All the guys that show up and they kind of know and they even say to the guy, I kind of knew this was probably you.  I knew you were going to be in here.  But it was worth the risk because fucking children is just kick's ass.  His logic is brilliant.  Your logic is brilliant, man.  It must be just fucking...  Hey, is it true that...  It must be.  Is it true that Cromwell's talking shit about Poe out there?  I'm hearing that Cromwell...  Cromwell thinks Poe is a Nancy boy queer. 
[02:57:00]  Is that true, Cromwell?  Absolutely not.  I did not say that at all.  A Nancy boy queer.  Wow.  And what does Poe think of all this?  Where's Poe?  Whoa.  Very angry.  And I did say I was a fan of the new studio.  Not anymore.  Until these bugs are figured out.  Poe, are you allowed to beat the shit out of one of our listeners?  Is there a rule?  I don't know.  I'm serious.  What's the rule? 
[02:57:30]  The rule?  Well...  Do we have another form in that file cabinet of yours that protects you if you kill this fucker?  No.  No.  Not at all.  I definitely won't be protected with what I'm thinking about doing to him.  Really?  Yeah.  Can you wrestle him down?  Opie, I'm not a wrestler.  Let's get this straight.  I'm not a wrestler.  However...  Why don't you just throw a couple moves on him and then just...  Crushes glasses in front of him.  A couple of judo moves.  Yeah.  Crushes glasses.  His glass may fall into his eye. 
[02:58:00]  Can't you get him?  Because I've seen this before.  I've seen Poe get some guy on the street that might be a problem and get him into a hold  where the guy is completely subdued on the ground and cannot budge.  Now, that isn't really wrestling, but that would fit the rules because you're not eye-gouging  or anything like that.  Pain compliance.  Pain compliance.  No, he could wrestle and you could do whatever the hell you want.  Yeah.  As long as you don't leave a mark. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  You know.  What kind of form has Cromwell filled out today?  Just the basic one.  Oh, yeah.  That covers you giving him a beating.  Great.  The basic one.  Yeah.  That's in there, right?  Life limb.  Yeah.  We would have to find out how we...  Cromwell, you really want in or what?  Yeah, man.  Definitely.  See?  He's not scared of you, Paul.  I'm sorry to say he's not scared of you.  Well, that's all good.  It's a sport.  Hmm. 
[02:59:00]  You want to do a little demonstration?  Cromwell?  Sure.  I'm game.  Cromwell?  All right.  Get Cromwell in here.  All righty.  Wait.  They're going to set up the studio.  We'll take...  Hopefully, the phones are working now.  Uh, Corinne.  Corinne.  Yeah.  They told me to try the phones again because they work.  Uh, Corinne.  Yeah.  She'll say hi once the delay hits her.  They're still not working. 
[02:59:30]  Hold on a minute.  Let's try this one.  Uh, Jason and Rocklin.  Jason?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're still not working.  The phones aren't working.  All right, Cromwell.  So, what's the deal?  You can last 30 seconds.  You're going to wrestle and poke and do whatever he wants?  Yeah, basically, you know, short of eye gouges and, you know, arm snaps.  Correct, Master Poe?  No, it's not an arm snap.  It's going to be, you know, he's going to do something to your arm that's going to make you scream. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, obviously, arm bar, you know, I'm tapping out if he's got me, you know, locked up with some Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  And what's your tap-out word?  Tapping out is, you know, tapping the body.  All right, Paul, are you in?  Where are these fucking people?  Where are these people going?  I'm your man, Louie.  Let's get a, this is just so weird.  Here there's rules out in the street, there are no rules, but, you know.  Let's get a verbal from Cromwell.  How long, 30 seconds he said?  A verbal from Cromwell. 
[03:00:30]  You will not sue if Poe hurts you.  It's verbal.  Verbal.  Huh?  Binding verbal.  Say it.  Say it.  I will not sue if Poe hurts me.  Poe, please don't hurt me.  Yeah, that's legal.  No, he's not going to hurt me.  Legal and binding, I'm sure.  All right.  Taking off his jacket, Poe is.  Oh, he's also taking his shirt out of his pants, like, untucking it.  And the tie comes off.  He takes off his tie.  He's just getting himself.  Let's get the pen in your pocket.  Wait, open the door so we can get the crowd.  That could injure you.  Because the oohs and aahs from the crowd when they see Cromwell and a pretzel is going 
[03:01:00]  to be just brilliant for the show today.  Remember the stripper pole platform has corners.  Yeah.  That could, you know, put a gouge in his head.  We really need the phones to work.  I hope they figure that out for maybe tomorrow's show.  Yeah.  All right.  What else is, okay, he took a quarter out of his pocket.  Usually.  Wallet.  He's ready.  Yeah.  Poe is still not happy about what happened last week, so Cromwell, I think you're going 
[03:01:30]  to suffer because of that.  I'm serious.  Keep the doors open so we can hear the crowd.  You got the mic on.  Oh, it's working?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right, Poe.  All right.  A little demonstration.  All right.  The only thing I want to say is, again, this is not real.  On the street.  This is not real?  Okay.  Oh, basically what he's saying is if this was on the street and no one was looking,  you would be fucked.  Yeah.  There's this.  He's going to...  I don't doubt that.  All right.  He'd fishhook you in your asshole.  Yeah, because he plays nice for the radio show, but if it came down to it, he would take 
[03:02:00]  one of your eyeballs right out of your head.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  That said, you know, I still think I can last 30 seconds.  30 seconds.  By the way, Cromwell equals Tapwell from Zeus in Bridgeport.  All right.  Who's the one fucking camera I got working, Sam?  And that's it.  So don't stand in front of it.  Cromwell.  All right.  Hey, by the way, Cromwell just texted us and gave us some instant feedback.  It says, from Cromwell in studio, so it has to be real.  Master Poe is a limp-dicked faggot. 
[03:02:30]  Bring it on.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Did you just write that?  That.  As you can see, I have no texting device on me.  Man.  I don't know, man.  I mean, I believe it says, sent by Cromwell, location in studio.  It says it right there.  I see it right there.  That's true.  I think there's a lot of culprits right out there with texting machines.  Texting machines.  Texting machines.  Yeah.  That's an electric...  Texting machine.  By the way, get you.  By the way, Smokezilla writes... 
[03:03:00]  Text machines.  Dot.  Dot.  Smokezilla writes, Cromwell, the pain you will be feeling is not real either.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see now.  All right, Poe.  What are you going to do to this kid?  I will react on his action.  Ah, interesting.  Ah.  But he thinks he can last 30 seconds.  Yeah.  He's going to use his own mistakes.  Fair enough.  Start the 30 seconds when we make physical contact.  All right.  Ah, that's good.  I like that.  No dilly-dallying around.  Did we move the nice leather couches out of the way? 
[03:03:30]  I would hate to get blood on them.  I mean, they're still brand new.  Try to stay on the Ron and Fez carpet there.  It just makes it easier for me to keep them in frame.  All right.  A lot of people say 15 seconds tops for you.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's see.  All right.  As soon as they make contact.  Okay.  Now it's started.  Okay.  No, not yet.  You don't know how to shake and bow your head, Cromwell.  Oh, you got to pet in your pocket.  Bow your heads.  Without wrestling.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  Here they go. 
[03:04:00]  And.  All right.  Here we go.  They're at it.  I'm good.  Oh, God.  That's what it is.  There goes the machines.  Out of bounds.  Huge mistake.  Out of bounds.  He's tapping out.  He's tapping out.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Hasn't tapped.  Hasn't tapped.  10 seconds, I think.  20.  10 left.  10 left.  He might last.  He might last.  All right.  That was a head hitting the floor. 
[03:04:30]  Time's up.  All right.  Time's up.  He lasted 30 seconds.  Wow.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  He just left Paul hanging on the floor.  And he just did the Superstar movie.  Superstar.  And then they hugged.  I wish I could explain what happened.  It was just.  It looked like two men having gay sex.  That's why I don't really know what it was.  How did you guys get to the couch?  It was fast and furious gay sex. 
[03:05:00]  He went for a choke hold.  He had it right away.  I don't know how he didn't choke me out.  I think he went easy.  You're basically saying that he's lost a little.  I think he could have choked me out.  He's lost a step.  But he didn't finish.  Yeah.  He didn't pull the finishing move on him.  Yeah.  It was kind of a lot of man-on-man hugging.  Yeah.  And then Poe actually flipped him over one of the leather chairs.  Poe, you hit your head on the floor.  I heard that.  That was a nice sound that everyone got to hear out there.  Have that wood checked for any dents. 
[03:05:30]  You know, hard head.  I need to ask him.  Yeah, Poe's got a serious head injury there.  I mean, he's got a red mark on his head.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Where?  Let me see.  Look, on his forehead.  Let me see.  It's going to be a welt.  It hit a hardwood floor.  Look at that.  Oh, damn, bro.  Oh, damn, bro.  You really need to ask.  He just got pwned.  You need...  Yeah.  What happened?  He hit it.  Oh, what happened?  He and...  I hit the floor.  We heard the thud. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  My head hit the floor.  Are you feeling woozy?  No, I just have a headache.  Already?  He's worse than he's showing right now.  I think he's a little bit of water in the brain right now.  We didn't talk about if he would have been injured, you know?  Yeah.  We just thought...  Well, he took his and Cromwell's weight to the floor.  Yeah.  And it landed on his head.  Wow.  By the way, someone's bringing up a very good point.  Even rape victims last 30 seconds, so...  Oh.  Damn, you just been pwned. 
[03:06:30]  That's a very good observation coming in from Instant Feedback.  Oosh.  I think you should have Poe checked out.  Poe's head's like a brick.  He could have got a concussion or something.  Nah, the front is...  That's where the skull is the thickest.  You're fine?  Well...  Your livelihood depends on saying that, so I don't know that I trust you.  You should get somebody to look at you.  Nah, the front of the skull's like thick. 
[03:07:00]  You've got no problem.  It's the back you've got to worry about, the top, the sides.  The front is made to be hit.  Does anyone know what Cromwell did there?  What were you doing?  Yeah, what the hell were you doing?  I was just basically defending.  I mean, you basically...  I do study a little bit of martial arts, and one of the things they tell you to do when  someone's got you in a neck hole is, you know, catch the arm, tuck your chin.  And basically, I was hanging in there for like, you know, the 30 seconds.  I almost tapped a couple times.  I heard people say it.  Not yet.  Not yet.  I mean, my hand was up.  I was waving and going for the tap. 
[03:07:30]  And, you know, I just knew I could...  Did a Hulk Hogan, like he's going to tap, and then he started shaking and gets up.  Didn't mean to get E-Rock so excited.  Cromwell, everyone.  We still hate your name, though.  Cromwell, there he goes.  Cromwell, good job.  Very impressive.  Very impressive.  Yep.  Still trying to look for the feel-good story for this Monday.  Poe, you all right?  Yeah, I'm good.  Master Poe is 0-2 in these 30-second competitions.  It's not fair, though.  He can't use all his tricks.  It isn't fair. 
[03:08:00]  I mean, they're not tricks, but he can't use everything.  Because all the liability is on him.  Yeah, it is.  I mean, he got hurt, and nobody gives a shit.  If Cromwell looked like that...  Oh, people would be going, oh, Paul, what'd you do to Cromwell?  Plus, we'd take all his weapons away from him.  He had to get rid of the pen, the quarter, the tie.  You know, these are things he uses in a street fight, right?  Anything on him is a potential weapon.  He knows.  That tie, he could take out a whole battalion.  With just that tie.  The pen, forget about it. 
[03:08:30]  Guys, thank you.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Hey, I got a...  Oh, we got...  Wow, this is kind of interesting.  We got a guy that goes by the name Opie's Spy from Philly.  Oh.  Ask if Cromwell would like to address this comment from Friday.  Why does a part of me think this is a...  That this is a cheap cop-out way for Opie and the rest of the crew to get out of work...  Get out of doing any more work today.  Is he angry typing guy?  Are you angry typing? 
[03:09:00]  Where is Cromwell?  Come back in.  Wait, you think Anthony falling asleep was a cheap excuse for us to go home early?  Oh, my God.  Huh?  I don't think I wrote that.  Did I write that?  I don't think I wrote that.  Oh, boy.  When someone says, I don't think I wrote that, that's like, oh, fuck, they're on to me.  That sounds guilty.  I like this guy.  His name's Opie's Spy.  Now, Cromwell, it says, have him address this that he wrote Friday.  Why does a part of me think this is a cheap cop-out way for Opie and the rest of the crew to get out of doing any more work today? 
[03:09:30]  He was only joking.  Well, you know, that was in the listening thread where just people talk really fast.  Oh, okay.  Wow, what a bad excuse.  That was just one theory.  Had you had more time to think about it, you wouldn't have been such a prick.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, but your theory sucks.  You don't think Anthony was sleeping?  Believe me.  Obviously, I said that early in the bit, and once I realized Anthony was asleep, I apologized profusely, 
[03:10:00]  and I wish Opie's Spy would find those messages.  But even if, let's say even we were faking that, that Anthony was sleeping, that would be the bit in itself, don't you think?  This is true.  You think we would purposely try to do something just to get out of work?  Absolutely not.  Look, I will prove it to you right now again.  No, no, no!  I'll put my feet up, and when I'm asleep in five seconds.  And at least, like, own up to it.  Everyone's saying you absolutely did write that.  Yeah, I think I did write that. 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  But I wrote, like, 20 other messages saying how great everybody is.  I think, and I'm going to post this.  How many bugs have you squished?  Under my pseudonym.  I'm going to post that I think that you challenging Poe was just a way for you to get on a couch close to another man as you grope each other.  We all knew that.  Faggot.  Yeah.  I look forward to the post.  Faggot.  It took care of the urge, didn't it, Cromwell? 
[03:11:00]  Are you pants all sticky, Cromwell?  Did Poe get hit in the forehead with your cock?  Is that why it's red?  With your hard cock.  And then someone is saying, though, it is kind of interesting that you did wake up just at 11, which is true.  Yeah, I know when to get the fuck out of here.  Sleep or awake.  I know when it's time to go.  You got a Cromwell fan out there.  Leave Cromwell alone. 
[03:11:30]  You know, Cromwell's a big supporter.  He takes a thousand pictures all day walking.  Leave Cromwell alone.  I hate that fucking guy.  But then again, it's backed up with Matt from New York City.  Cromwell's a queer.  Oh, Jesus.  That fucking...  Hey, they didn't laugh too hard at that one.  That means he probably...  That Britney Spears guy, like, his time is completely done, but he keeps trying to throw more videos up on YouTube and shit. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, do I just want him pummeled?  He's fucking his own brother.  Did you know that?  There was something.  I saw one video where he's, like, making out with...  He's making out with this guy and they say that they're brothers.  Supposedly his brother, yeah.  I think he's trying to get attention.  I think he's a real attention whore.  Well...  Yeah, it's a...  I go through YouTube pretty much once every couple of days, see what's new on there.  And there's something about him that's always on there.  Who's giving this guy any more attention? 
[03:12:30]  I haven't clicked on any link.  Somebody's always watching him.  Yeah, it's like, what are you watching now?  What are people watching?  They're always watching him.  And he's popping up.  It's like, who's fucking watching this?  When there's a thousand other things you could be watching.  People getting hit in the nuts.  That's always a scream.  Uh, Opie's other spy, uh, checking in.  Louie and his robot dog.  Yeah.  Opie's other spy checking in from Jamaica Station.  Cromwell posted that he thinks you guys are just too lazy to do the walkover and he hates  ecstasy of gold. 
[03:13:00]  Ah.  Hmm.  Did, uh, Cromwell and Flea change places so Flea could get some fucking pal talk camera  time, you attention whore?  Did you?  Because I looked up there and it's like, it was on Cromwell.  I didn't move the camera, but now Flea is prominently displayed.  Flea is a douchebag.  All right.  Moving on with the feel-good story here.  We'll try this one.  There was a dead raccoon kind of right where this line is, um, and it was dead, and when 
[03:13:30]  they were striping the road here on Archer, they just striped right over it.  The raccoon was gone today, but in this picture, you can clearly see the dead animal with the  tell-tale yellow paint right across its body.  No, it was very real, um, and it was, you know, pretty explicit.  You could see it.  The kids were kind of grossed out by it, and I as well.  It's the dead animal in the street that they just striped right over it.  The animal was first spotted on Archer Avenue in Lamont by residence on Saturday.  I just thought it was ridiculous.  They were that lazy they didn't pick it up. 
[03:14:00]  That's terrible.  It is terrible.  How they do their job.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  How is it terrible?  It's a dead fucking animal in the road that they painted over.  You want them to push it off to the side of the road?  Such a non-story.  They're probably laughing, having fun.  Dude, put the stripe over the phone.  It's funny.  Let the guys have a laugh during work.  You might be honest, Tom, because as this continues, it's not the first time.  And Yolanta Wilkes says what's worse is that it's not the first time.  Another animal painted right over. 
[03:14:30]  The same thing.  We followed her directions on Archer and came up with this roadkill.  A close-up reveals what appears to be the critter's tail protruding from a line of paint.  We contacted the Illinois Department of Transportation, and they confirmed that this stretch of Archer  Avenue is in their jurisdiction.  But they declined our request for an on-camera interview, saying they need to wait until  they can confirm that the allegations are true.  Just look at the animal with the line painted on it.  Why can't people just be honest?  An animal had a line painted on it, and then it was chased around by a French skunk. 
[03:15:00]  Isn't that how that started?  He tried to rape it.  Yeah, isn't that how it started?  Pappy Le Pew was the cartoon rapist.  Grabbing her.  She's trying to get away.  Clawing.  Now we're kind of fading into something that needs to be brought up on this show.  Uh-oh.  Danny finds the most horrific things for this radio show.  Yeah, God bless.  And then they just pile up, because we're in...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you doing?  Oh, there's an actual picture of the raccoon? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Dude, look at...  Pop that picture up on the big screen.  Put it up on a screen somewhere?  Yeah, it's just a huge dead raccoon, and the line was painted right over it.  Like, the truck had to go boom, boom, boom, as it rolled over this thing.  Look at this thing.  Good for him.  Can we get that up on our website somewhere?  Stupid raccoon.  Wow. 
[03:16:00]  That'll happen.  You're fucking painting lines on the street.  Yeah.  What else are you going to do for entertainment?  What?  Get out of the way.  Yeah.  The best part is, though...  It should be a person.  Go die somewhere else, you faggot raccoon.  The road crew probably saw it ahead, and were just praying that their paint was going to...  You know, they're like, oh, dude, I think we might just go over it.  Yeah.  Like, if we keep this...  It's right in the middle of the road.  It's right in the middle.  This is going to happen.  I think they probably...  You know, they probably saw it coming.  We're hoping and having fun on that truck. 
[03:16:30]  It's waiting to paint over that shit.  Even better.  I bet it was probably a little too far to the right or the left, and one got out and kicked  it over a little bit, kicked it a little left.  Of course.  That's what you do when you're fucking working.  That's it.  That made his day.  Have some fun, and they laughed.  All right.  Well, Danny also picked out this fine animal story.  This is just some of the stuff he collects for our show.  Robstown police arrested this man, 26-year-old Eduardo Ramos of Victoria, on September 12th  after they found him naked inside his pickup truck. 
[03:17:00]  Now they are accusing him of sexually assaulting this dog.  There's a dog.  Rolled up in the back like he was scared.  I stopped to talk to the driver and found that he was completely nude, covering his  genitals with his clothing, sweaty and nervous.  Sweaty and nervous.  You too would be nervous if you knew the thing had claws.  Oh, man.  What a weird description.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Can I hear that again?  Covering his genitals.  Just the end?  Just the description that that guy gave of the...  Just the story narrated by that individual.  This dog.  There was a dog rolled up in the back like he was scared.  I stopped to talk to the driver and found that he was completely nude, covering his  genitals with his clothing.  Genitals.  Sweaty and nervous.  Covering his genitals.  It's a strange way of talking.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  Let's see if this is really nude.  When they opened his truck, the female dog ran off into this field.  When officers found her, they say she seemed frightened.  She was in a shower.  The dog was...  After a while and...  Huh?  The dog was taking a shower.  A rape.  Found her.  They say she seemed frightened.  We inspected the dog after a while and, you know, the condition of the dog led us to  believe that he committed some type of sexual act with the dog. 
[03:18:30]  Ramos later told detectives he picked up the stray dog near a gas station.  He denied having sex with the dog, but it was obvious to them the dog had been sexually  assaulted.  I couldn't believe it, you know.  I searched for some other explanation, but everything led to that.  Ramos was charged with public lewdness and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors, but  police say he could face felony charges of animal cruelty.  The district attorney is waiting for DNA results to determine if Ramos had sexual contact with 
[03:19:00]  the dog.  There you go.  They found a human load in the dog's dog.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  I searched for another explanation.  That's pretty much it.  You find that load in there and do a little DNA test thing and go, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, why couldn't he?  He was just jerking off and the dog just happened to be in the car.  Dog fucker.  Louie, you're onto something.  Again.  That's what happened.  I don't like animals in the room when I'm fucking.  I can't, because my dog always, well, when I'm jerking off, my dog looks at me. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  They give you a look.  Fucking look at me.  Or the worst thing is, and I've heard stories of this, I've never owned a dog, but you're  going at it, and just cold dog nose goes right up your ass.  Yeah.  Right up your ass.  And then, God forbid, you have a cat, and you're doing some kind of, you know, your balls  are swinging.  Oof.  That's got to hurt.  Yeah.  A nice claw.  Actually, that's in the paper today.  Where's the post?  It is?  Give me that post.  Yeah.  It is? 
[03:20:00]  They referred to that famous, like, uh...  Let me see.  Go ahead.  Keep talking.  I'll find it.  It takes me two seconds.  I'm on the fucking, uh...  I'm on the condoms for, like, another fucking month.  What are you going to take?  Ah, that girlfriend, Mr. Pills.  Mr. Pills for, like, too many days, and then she goes, no, I've got to get them, and then  start on a Sunday, and then you wait and wait and wait, because I don't want to be  in the type of, you know, hell.  I don't want to be telling, no, no, it's thunder.  It's okay.  It's all cute when you do it. 
[03:20:30]  For me, I'd be going, yes, it's death incarnate.  It's coming to get you.  It's the Grim Reaper.  So, uh, uh, yeah.  Condoms.  Yeah.  Back...  Should I fucking be wearing condoms at the scene?  Yes, I don't wear, I don't fuck anything, so I don't really have that to complain about.  You, you have, uh, sex with your wife, Louie?  Oh, yeah, all the time.  I gotta say, you can fuck like a champ with him, though.  Three times this morning.  Yeah?  Once you get things going, as long as you can fucking, you know, roll that stupid thing  on without feeling like a complete ass, and you're all worked up, you could just fucking, 
[03:21:00]  fucking fuck.  It's amazing.  Great.  Last time I fucked my wife, the fucking, um, what do you call it, the national security  level, threat level, was green or something.  I don't know what...  Wouldn't it be like red or orange?  No, no, just green, all right, right?  There was no threat at all.  Last time I fucked my wife, my iPod had fucking three, five gigs hard drive in it. 
[03:21:30]  See, if we had phones today, we could go with this bit.  The last time Louie C.K. fucked his wife, but we can't use the phones today.  So instead, you get this.  And you don't even get that.  You don't get that.  Now you can sit right down and write yourself a letter, and you can squirt a pipsquirt pen.  When you're sitting in a tub, you can squirt it while you scrub. 
[03:22:00]  Who cares about the weather, as long as you can't squirt together.  If you wanna do some spray while you're playing, then you can squirt a pipsquirt pen.  Pipsquirt pen, it writes, and it squirts water, new from Lake...  Oh, pipquirt squirt pen?  I don't understand.  Interesting.  It's an old commercial where it's a little sexual innuendo going on there.  Yeah, because you could squirt each other.  Yeah.  Oh, I get it. 
[03:22:30]  Rawr.  With a pan.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Yeah, any of that birth control stuff should all be on the women's side.  Yeah.  That's what I'd say.  That's what you think?  I've gotten a big to-do on the show the other day about vasectomies and stuff, and I'm just  completely against that.  I like the pill, but then, you know, the rubbers? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, they're a drag.  Because then right when you're done, you gotta just fucking pull out.  Yeah.  You can't just leave that thing sitting in there like a time bomb, waiting to fucking go off.  And you have a bag of your own jizz.  Yeah, and when it pulls out, it kind of goes like, you know, and then, yeah, you got a bag  of it, and then you gotta take it off.  First of all, and as you fucking go to cum, you gotta, like, real quick grab the bottom  and hope for the best.  Yeah.  Hope you don't fire it off like a howitzer covered. 
[03:23:30]  Or something.  You know, you don't want any spillage.  It's just a big paranoid mess when you want to just fucking cum.  Yep.  You know, you're worried.  Is it gonna slip off?  Is it broken?  Are you gonna pull it off and the thing's gonna look like the end of one of those cartoon  exploded cigars, but not an ounce of jizz left in it?  No.  I've had one disappear completely.  Oh!  Cease to exist.  Thank you.  Danny just raised his hand on that one, too.  I'm in that club, too.  I don't know.  Dude, did you search for it without trying to look like you were searching for it? 
[03:24:00]  No, she was onto it, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, I don't know if it disappeared in the complicated parts that it is woman, but...  I had a condom break once, and I didn't say shit.  No, you never say it.  It's great!  All right, take care.  That fucking thing disappeared on me.  This is going back many years when I was back in New York and not even in radio yet.  And it just disappeared. 
[03:24:30]  And I swear, I looked all over the floor.  And then, I start feigning like I'm being amorous again, as I'm just looking for it.  I was just looking for it.  And then I'm thinking like, fuck, if this thing falls out of her tomorrow, she's going to really  think that's pretty rude.  That same exact story pretty much happened to me once.  And I never found it.  I never heard Heiden or Heron. 
[03:25:00]  When my wife and I were first dating, we were fucking once, and I felt something sharp at  the end.  Like, as I fucked her, there was something sharp scratching my dick.  And for like a couple of weeks, it was like that.  And I was like, I'm telling you, there's something in there.  And she didn't, you know...  So, we really went at it and searched and found this little piece of fucking plastic from  like a tampon apple cane or something.  Oh, shit!  It was a little piece of plastic in there.  It was just hanging out in there?  It was just in there.  Good thing you found that.  Yeah, it probably would have been bad. 
[03:25:30]  Mm-hmm.  Holy shit.  Well, you better get the instant feedback, because now people are playing the last time  Louis C.K.  Fucked my wife.  Last time I fucked my wife.  Yeah, it's coming nice now.  Too bad we can't use the phone.  Last time I fucked my wife.  Where did that condom go?  Huh?  Well, at least...  Skin Danny, where did that condom go?  I found it, but it was after about a solid, I'm not even exaggerating, maybe about 35 minutes  of searching. 
[03:26:00]  Was it in?  Yeah, it was, but we couldn't believe it at first, and it was to the point where...  I can't believe it!  It was so...  When does that ever happen?  So, like, I'm like, you know, looking under pillows and like under the bed, where it just  obviously cannot be, but I just could not imagine that it was in there somewhere.  I didn't even fest to the fact that it fucking got lost.  I mean, it got to the point where I had gotten dressed, and we were about to go to the emergency  room, because obviously this was a problem, or it was going to potentially be one.  And then right at the last minute, I'm like, let's try to find it again. 
[03:26:30]  Take a good fucking grab.  Yeah, and just kind of crook the finger a little bit.  I feel it.  Yeah, there's the old Coney Island whitefish.  It worked.  I found it.  It's like I went to the dentist's office for a scraping.  For a scraping.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's fucking sick, man.  All right.  I finally found it.  For real.  Here is your feel-good story for today, Monday.  This is a story about ageless love. 
[03:27:00]  In Argentina, this 82-year-old woman just got married to this 24-year-old man.  Love blossomed between these two when the groom went to live with the bride, a family friend,  after his mother died.  After being engaged for several years, a civil service sealed the relationship.  This newlywed says his wife is a very special person with amazing energy.  When asked that the marriage would be purely spiritual, the bride says there will be more,  a response greeted with laughter. 
[03:27:30]  The couple is off to a honeymoon in Rio de Janeiro, proving with a kiss that old saying,  love knows no boundaries.  Everyone laughed when they said, we're going to be fucking, because that's pretty much it.  Is it spiritual or anything else?  Oh, we'll be fucking.  Sure you will.  Of course you will. 
[03:28:00]  In Rio de Janeiro.  She's 82, he's 24.  That'll work out well.  That's good.  Fucking.  I hope they don't bring the KY in their carry-on, because there are limitations to fluids you  can bring on the aircraft these days.  He's got to burst the scabs on her pussy to get any lubrication.  Oh, my God.  Ah.  Yeah.  Eating her out, he looks like Colonel Sanders. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, God.  All flakes on his, dander flakes on his beard after eating her out.  Hoodie from Philly, the last time Louie fucked his wife.  Can I say fucked his wife, or are you going to get mad at that?  What do I care?  All right, good.  She doesn't have the exam, is what you're saying.  Yeah, exactly.  Louie's in dangerous fucking sitting mode right there.  I know.  I've got my legs up.  That's dangerous, man.  Don't worry.  We're getting ready for line of the day.  We'll get you out of here before you fall asleep.  Wow.  Bill Buckner missed a famous ground ball at first base. 
[03:29:00]  All right, that's okay.  All right, how about awful me?  The last time Louie fucked his wife, Treehouse Richard only had HIV.  Aw.  That shit is.  Linger longer.  You know, by the way, on Pal Talk the other day, my sister had sent me pictures and said,  I found these.  They're pictures of the real Treehouse Richard and sent it to me.  So I popped them up on Pal Talk one night and everybody got a good look and said, wow,  I was a lucky guy because apparently everyone found him hot. 
[03:29:30]  Now that you have seen pictures, is it obvious that he was a gay guy?  Oh, yeah.  It was pretty always obvious, yeah.  Even when you were a kid?  Yeah.  Like, when I was a kid, I had no idea, like, there were gay kids around me.  I had no clue.  Yeah.  But then when you get older and you start looking back, you're like, oh, yeah, of course  he was.  He looked pretty gay.  But at the time, when you're just, like, riding bikes and trading baseball cards or whatever,  you really didn't know.  Because I was growing up with him.  It was more like, you know, you got to high school age and you see him and like, oh, yeah, 
[03:30:00]  all right.  All right.  Now all that makes sense from the old days.  Because when I started, like, chasing girls around and stuff, and girls were always after  him, like, always after him, he just showed no interest whatsoever.  None.  And I was like, oh, my God, what are you doing?  That girl is fucking, like, hanging on you.  Yeah, well, you know, I...  Remember when we found out our old PD was gay? 
[03:30:30]  Remember the story?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're, uh, Louis, we're working at NEW and we're, like, walking with our PD and  our general manager.  We're having this deep conversation about the show and where it's going and just talking  business as we're going to a sushi joint and everyone is just piping in, blah, blah,  blah, right?  And this girl walks by, like, she's got just huge boobs, no bra, just ridiculous, small  skirt.  And it stopped us in our tracks.  We just stopped talking and we're all just like, ah. 
[03:31:00]  And the guy who we learned later was gay was...  So, and then what you guys got to do, he's just still talking.  Oh, my God.  Are you still talking?  We're like, we don't even know what we were talking about at this point.  In the restaurant when this girl comes in and sits down and she had real low ride pants  on and her thong was sticking up out of the pants.  And, again, conversation comes to a screeching halt.  We all just turn our heads and start looking.  Even our GM.  And he's just like, um, can I have another order of this? 
[03:31:30]  Edamame.  Yeah, all right.  We get it.  We get it.  You like the cock.  I worked with a gay guy who was the...  Like, he would...  He'd see a girl and go, oh, my God, look at her tuts.  I'd like to fuck them.  Like, he didn't know how to do it.  Oh, oh.  Very sad.  That's sad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't have to do that.  Don't.  Don't force it.  No.  Don't force it.  All right.  We wanted to do this story on the other side.  Another person got kicked off a plane for wearing something inappropriate. 
[03:32:00]  Inappropriate.  Now, the first two were like, you know, hot girls with hot outfits.  But the one that I saw in Southwest, she was not...  It was not a big deal.  No, it wasn't ridiculous.  She was wearing a skirt, but it wasn't ridiculously short.  No.  And then she had...  She was covered up top.  And up top, it was a sexy top, but she had a bra and everything.  Who's taking some...  I don't know.  If it was the case on every airline...  It has to be ugly.  Marissa, they would be on a no-fly list with terrorists. 
[03:32:30]  She wouldn't be allowed to fly.  She's always showing cleavage.  That was a compliment.  Yeah, it was a compliment, by the way.  Yeah, because Ash is not really sure.  It must be ugly flight attendants who were like, yeah.  You whore.  Get off this plane, you whore.  Yeah, that's what it is.  And I think it was...  In one case, I think it was a guy flight attendant because...  And here's what I think.  Guy came in.  This guy's like...  The flight attendant's like, I'm going to give him all the attention this whole fucking flight. 
[03:33:00]  And then this boob, big monster comes in and sits down and the guy takes interest in her.  Yeah.  And he's like, well, she's got to go.  Get out of here.  She was cock-blocking him.  Ugly bitch.  Yeah.  Flat.  Flat.  Well, we have another one of those.  Let's take a listen to this.  Southwest Airlines says it will apologize to a passenger told to change his sexually suggestive shirt or get off the plane.  Joe Winnecke says he was sitting in the last row of a Columbus to Tampa flight when an employee gave him the ultimatum. 
[03:33:30]  Winnecke says...  Columbus to Tampa.  What a hell flight anyway.  Both cities we could lose.  If Iran hit Columbus and Tampa, we would even go, dude, don't worry about it.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Just say it was an accident.  I thought it was a nonstop flight from New York to London or something.  Two worst cities ever.  Columbus to Tampa.  Jesus.  From shit to fuck.  Let him fly naked.  Who gives a shit? 
[03:34:00]  Don't worry about his shirt.  From the country's asshole to its pussy.  This is the worst two cities.  Yeah, but pussy's nice.  I know, but not the country's pussy.  200 years old.  Stinks.  So it's an old pussy.  Yeah, it's a smelly old pussy.  Jesus.  Was sitting in the last row of a Columbus to Tampa flight when an employee gave him the ultimatum.  Winnecke says the airline violated his free speech rights.  Back in July, Southwest created a public uproar by telling a woman on a flight that her outfit was too revealing for her to fly. 
[03:34:30]  Now, the guy had a t-shirt that had some kind of masturbation joke on it.  Yeah.  Like, masturbator.  It was a fishing, it looked like a fishing bait supply store thing.  That was named Masturbator.  Masturbator.  That's old one.  You know, that old gag.  I wonder where it was.  Because I have a t-shirt from a place in Connecticut called Masturbate and Tackle.  Yeah.  And I wear it all the time.  That's pretty much the shirt.  They would kick you off the plane.  They only showed Masturbator on TV.  Yeah, they wouldn't even show the other half of the shirt.  I bet it's the same place. 
[03:35:00]  So we're like, well, Masturbator.  It's a very old place.  It's not like, you know, they're not trying to be jack-offs.  Oh, it's a real place.  Yeah, Masturbate and Tackle.  It's kind of a popular shirt because it's funny.  Yeah, but even.  And then on the back it says I get my crabs at Masturbate and Tackle.  But even old people had.  Could they make any more fucking, like, genital jokes?  Yeah.  I jack off my cock at the fish store.  Yeah.  It's not even trying to be subtle or clever anymore.  Exactly.  Fuck a cunt here.  Fuck a cunt, fish store.  You're missing the obvious. 
[03:35:30]  Just because they've been around forever doesn't mean the old dude was making the joke back then.  No, that's true.  But it's a legitimate name.  I think the word Masturbator was around since, like, the cavemen started figuring out what to do.  Ah, yes.  Do it themselves.  Like in the old days.  I don't understand the word Masturbate when you think of it, actually.  Hey, Masturbator.  Yeah, it doesn't really matter.  Like, what are the, what's the root of that?  What's the origin?  Than, origin?  Masturbator.  Masturbator.  I believe it is a Latin word.  Masturbator.  Uh, I have no idea. 
[03:36:00]  What derivative?  Uh, master being to master.  Masters.  And bait being to bait.  Yeah.  What is it?  Oh, uh, uh, than?  Anything?  That's just what the internet had, Ant.  That's funny.  The internet.  Um, the word is believed to derive from either the Greek word maseia, meaning penises, or  the Latin manus, hand, and the Latin turbare, to disturb.  So, disturb with the hand. 
[03:36:30]  There is a disturbance going on.  Yeah.  Penis disturbance with your hand.  Yeah.  Oh, more?  A competing etymology based on the Latin manu stuprare, which means to defile with the  hand.  Ah, defile with the hand.  Yeah.  And that's it, pretty much.  How do we get masturbate out of that?  More importantly, how's mother?  You gotta give us a mother update.  Mother?  I'll have to go through one of my siblings.  I'll have, I'll ask my brother how she's doing.  Louie, he doesn't like mother.  No?  He refers to her as mother. 
[03:37:00]  Hmm.  Mother?  Mother frowns upon that.  Mother, uh, gave him some, gave him some hard times.  Hmm.  That's, uh, what I saw.  I have problems with father, but I'm getting over them.  Yeah.  Getting over.  Yeah.  So do I.  Tell me about it.  Yeah.  That guy's been dead.  Awkward.  Can't I call him?  He doesn't answer the phone?  Awkward.  Uh, hey, masturbator?  Oh, no, no, no. 
[03:37:30]  Please, any, dig up any other thing.  Another fucking disc that's sitting there, aside from, hey, masturbator.  It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's old.  Oh, it was a song parody from when the Macarena was, like, really fucking popular.  Oh, don't play that.  It's like, yeah, I, I mean, you know, uh, very proud of it when it first came out, but  at this point.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[03:38:00]  Exactly.  Now you get the hell out of here.  Like that guy.  He sits my, he sits, uh, he sits him down, uh, uh, to, to, to dinner.  And he's like, ah, why didn't you tell me, uh, who you worked for?  Ah, well, you know, I like keeping that secret.  Right.  And then he just got more and more pissed until he's like, get the hell out of here.  I don't care how many guineas come out of the good work.  Yeah, yeah, you didn't care.  You could have just let him finish.  My Kraut McFriend. 
[03:38:30]  I'm German Irish.  Oh, very cool.  All right, uh, we'll play this and then we'll get, uh, line of the day out of the way.  It's, uh, it's, this is one of my favorites.  Uh, it's, it's butt plug.  Ah, yes.  Okay.  Now this is timeless.  Yes, it sure is.  Butt plug.  May I help you?  Yes, uh, butt plugs.  Who?  Butt plugs, please.  Spark plugs, yes, ma'am.  How can I help you?  Uh, butt plugs.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  A what box?  Uh, butt plugs. 
[03:39:00]  A bud box?  Butt plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt plugs.  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Uh, butt plugs.  Butt, butt box?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello.  Uh, what are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug.  What kind?  Butt plug.  What kind of a spark plug?  Uh, no, butt plug.  I, I, I just don't understand you, sir. 
[03:39:30]  I'm sorry.  Uh, butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug?  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, butt.  But what do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to figure...  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah, okay.  I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs. 
[03:40:00]  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt?  Butt plug.  Sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt plug?  Yeah, we don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right.  Who is that?  Who's the voice? 
[03:40:30]  Butt plug.  Is that you?  Yeah, that's it.  That was a fun one.  That was up in Boston.  You could tell.  Where do you use it faster?  Where do you use it faster?  Bug blocks?  Bug blocks?  He always said, you know, that after you hung up, just like 20 minutes there.  He said, butt plug.  I don't understand.  Butt plug?  He said, no, honey.  He says spark plug.  Goodness gracious.  He's in the bug box.  Roger Clemens is getting a butt plug.  They get the line of the day ready. 
[03:41:00]  Why don't we play this one, too?  So, hi, mom.  I'm in porno.  This is one of my favorites.  That was a favorite for Mother's Day.  Looks like it's right up there.  This one as well.  We had a daughter, Lou.  Yeah.  Call her mom at work to tell her that she's going into porn.  And was it true?  Because she's in college.  No.  No.  Just to win it.  Is it a joke?  Yeah, she went to college.  Just to win like a CD or something stupid.  Oh, God.  IAF.  Who's this?  Wow.  Michelle.  I'm Michelle.  You want to play hi, mom?  Who's this?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Fuck that.  Hi, it's Opie and Anthony, Joe. 
[03:41:30]  Hi, I am.  Hello?  Opie's voice is a little higher.  He insists the tape has been altered.  Yeah, yeah.  All set up like the Charlie Chaplin film.  Yeah, yeah.  Different frame rate now.  That's why.  Yeah.  It was actually on audio tape at one point.  That's right.  And the tape may have stretched or something.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that's exactly what happened.  Yeah.  But for some reason, it didn't affect Dan's voice.  I don't understand that part of this.  I must have really.  That's because you were talking a lot lower.  I was talking like this back then.  Like you had a growth thing happening. 
[03:42:00]  Butt plug.  Like Imus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like Imus.  Yes.  Here's hi, mom.  I'm in porno.  Ignore the hi voice, please.  Because the material is still terrific.  All right.  Don't get distracted by the hi voice.  All right.  Hi, AF.  Who's this?  McDonald's.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play hi?  You're still laughing, though.  I love it.  Low.  I said ignore that.  The funny thing is it's high because you're so earnest and you want to keep your radio job. 
[03:42:30]  That's what it's doing.  I swear to God, this is all it.  No, no.  It won't be any quiet.  Nothing will get quiet.  We're just going to talk the whole time.  It'll be really good.  Fuck you.  Fuck you with your logic.  I hate you.  It's only in contrast to now.  You're yourself.  You're, you know, you're a grown man.  Your logic is brilliant.  Hi, please don't fire it.  I swear to God, this is good.  It's good radio.  Don't worry.  Hi, you're on the air.  Quickly talk before it gets quiet.  Keep talking.  Keep talking.  And now we let, like, dead air go a little bit.  Yeah.  Our voices are deeper. 
[03:43:00]  By the end of our career, it's going to be worried.  I did a radio show in Florida and fucking Tampa a couple of weeks ago.  And they have music playing behind the talking.  It's one of those.  Yeah.  We had that.  We worked on one of those stations.  And there's this guy and this woman.  And he talks like this.  And she goes like that.  And it doesn't, they are so desperate to talk that they say stuff that makes no sense.  Anything.  Yeah.  Like, it just, oh, you had a show.  What was it called?  It was called Lucky Louie.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:43:30]  That was on, yeah.  I'm like, what?  What did you just say?  You just have to fill up the air.  Stop talking.  It's something I'll have.  All the time.  As long as we keep talking, we don't answer the phone and say we're fired.  All right.  Fuck this bit.  Let's see.  I won't hear it.  I won't make any comments.  Please.  The material still holds up.  Totally.  Do you understand that?  Totally.  Hi, yeah, yeah.  Who's this?  Michelle.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom.  I'm in porno.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Awesome.  All right, listen.  I think officially I can't hear this shit anymore.  You can never go back.  Because I know it's coming.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  That was awesome.  Why could I just say, all right, cool.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Here we go.  Because we just had to be over the top fucking there.  Joey from Howard Beach.  Ha ha.  Eager Opie rules.  Eager Opie. 
[03:44:30]  You just created a new character, you know.  Mm-hmm.  And punt.  Douche.  Duncan Booth douche.  Hey, Ope, can you follow the yellow brick road in your original radio voice?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, here comes the yeah.  Awesome.  Play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom.  I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Now, where's your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny.  Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet 
[03:45:00]  so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right.  I got your mom's number.  I'm giving it a call right now.  Okay.  Amazing.  You're a person center.  Hi.  Can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay.  Hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  And this woman doesn't know she's on the air.  No.  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know. 
[03:45:30]  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but now I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies.  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  No.  Too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Oh, my God. 
[03:46:00]  She couldn't say no, and she was trying to get it out of her head.  Mom?  I don't know how to tell you this.  It's so weird.  How good she is at this.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  No.  And then, after the no's, she just...  She can't even get a fucking thought together.  I backed up.  Porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  I...  It's...  No.  Too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Um...  How could you do that to your mother? 
[03:46:30]  You...  Hold on.  Okay.  There was eight no's in there, by the way.  Seven.  Losing her fucking mind.  No.  No.  She's doing...  She's going to another phone now, right?  She's going to a more private...  Probably right.  She's going to like, I have to take this in the other room.  Are you okay, Shelly?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Just like, I'll be right back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just please don't pick that up.  Yeah.  I'm going to the break room.  Through all those no's, she progressively just thought of her daughter in a porno movie.  How could you do that to your mom for tickets?  I know.  It's great. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, fucking great.  What was that?  I don't know.  People out there.  Oh, it's them?  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  I have, like, three days to get out of here.  So I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  What am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling. 
[03:47:30]  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where can I call you?  The same number, but, Mom?  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people. 
[03:48:00]  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that...  You killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really nice.  Okay.  I am going to kill you.  I love you.  Wait, wait, wait, Mom.  Mom, first kill us.  It's Opie and Anthony from AF Radio in Boston.  Oh, you guys.  We put her up to it, and...  I got to admit, man, my heart sunk to my damn kneecaps.  Oh, my God.  I felt so bad for you.  Jesus.  I'm breaking out in a sweat here. 
[03:48:30]  I'm thinking that it's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  God damn it.  I really like that woman because she didn't give up on her daughter during that.  No, no.  She believed it, but she sounded positive.  Like, it's going to be okay.  I'm going to get you out of this.  I'm going to get you out of this jam.  You sucked Ron Jeremy's dick already.  I'm pretty sure you did the fucking thing's out of the bag.  You just did it once.  It's not like...  There's not an internet yet, really.  What's weird is it sounded like she was a few steps away from saying, honey, I did it 
[03:49:00]  too.  It's no big deal.  It's no nursing school.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  Look, don't worry about this.  I didn't even think of that yet.  You know what?  And by the way, not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Do it for a month.  That's it.  Right.  Yeah, that's all.  Just get your bank account.  She sounds so prepared.  Make a lot of money real fast.  Where can I reach you right now?  Where can I reach you?  Because I got this figured out.  Yeah, I got some stories.  That's a mom with a battle plan.  I got some stories, right?  That's definitely a mom with a battle plan.  Yeah.  Like, unshakable.  She was shaking up a little bit.  Okay. 
[03:49:30]  Okay.  Let me get my ducks in order here.  Here we go.  We'll get to the battle plan.  Here we go.  You need, first of all, a good agent.  Yeah.  Good agent.  Good porno.  You do it short.  Get in, get out.  Make as much money as possible.  Pay for your college.  What name did you pick?  What name did you pick?  What's your name?  Dye your hair today.  And don't tell dad.  Yeah.  God damn.  You know what sucks?  They took that away from radio guys.  You can't do prank calls anymore.  No.  Oh, you can't?  Nope.  Well, because you got to tell people they're going to be on the air, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're like, you could do the prank, but they have to be informed beforehand that they're 
[03:50:00]  going to be recorded.  Yeah, that's great.  And a lawyer will actually tell you this.  Like, it's an option that you would consider.  Oh, good news is I could still do this, but I just got to tell them ahead of time.  You got to tell them ahead of time that it's going to be there.  And on what fucking planet does that work?  Jesus.  You got to have somebody.  You want to choke out some of these lawyers.  So, but can you call them taped, though?  You can't do it live.  No.  You can't even tape them and say, look, I got a tape of this, and I want to put it on  the radio.  And if they say, logically, I thought, if they say no, then you destroy the tape. 
[03:50:30]  The effect of even taping somebody without their knowledge, even if they give it afterwards,  is a no-no.  Right.  So, they have to give permission.  They have to send someone over their house with one of those men in black sticks to go  foonk so they forget.  And then you can make the call.  That's right.  And it's as easy as that.  That's great.  As soon as we invent one.  Yeah.  In the meantime, lawyers come up with wacky things and reasons why we can't do shit.  Right.  All right.  Why don't we do line of the day?  Line of the day. 
[03:51:00]  Of course, it's brought to you by BodogFantasy.net, free live scoring, stats, bios, and news that  will help you win big this season.  I read that.  In fantasy football.  Friday.

Definitely the first one.  Oh, my God.  You never fuck up when you're reading shit.  Oh, that was a bad one.  I still had sleepies in my eyes.  Oh. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, jeez.  I just gave you like a backhanded compliment.  You never fuck up when you're reading shit.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Is it true?  She said booger headed ho.  Booger headed ho.  No eager opie there.  Deeper scratchy voice.  Yeah.  Yep.  Hey, it's out.  You want to play Hey Mom?  Love that.  Awesome.  Awesome.

It's just terrible.  Is it really hard to watch?  Yeah.  I put them on my website.  They're up there.  Can you bring it in?  It's on my website.  But who gives a shit about that?  We do it in front of you and have like 10 guys beat the shit out of you for an hour.  Oh, God.  We did that.  We've done that.  We did that with our first show that we ever did.  We did it with Vox.  We did it with Norton.  Which was just one of the most embarrassing things to have to listen to because you think 
[03:52:30]  he sounds eager?  He was in radio.  I wasn't and wanted to be.  Yeah.  So I was just a happy to fucking be there asshole.  Everything was, oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was saying stuff on stage like, come on, folks.  Stuff like that.  Come on, folks.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Come on, folks.  Dude, write a note and come on in with that.  Okay.  That would really be fun.  Sometime this week.  Let's get it done.  Okay.  That would be fun.  Do it over here because we could go long form or something like that. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, of course.  And we could say your shit sucked instead of, you know.  Right.  That was subpar.  Bring it in one day this week before you head out to bed.  Oh, you've gotten much better.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  We were privy to a nice conversation Louie was having with his daughter about Thunder.  Yeah.  Thunder's a black gentleman that she's dating.  That was really fun.  That was just mean.  That was just mean-spirited.  We always have said black with gentlemen. 
[03:53:30]  Yes, gentlemen.  When using them negatively in the story.  What the fuck?  Why is that?  Here's a black gentleman.  Makes us feel better.  A top hat and a cane.  A monocle.  A couple things you need to know before line of the day.  Louie's going to be at the House of Blues in Vegas Saturday.  Saturday night.  And Jimmy's going to be on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  Tonight, of course.  So take a peek at that.  Okay?  Right.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.

[03:54:30]  And the great finisher.  Yeah.  The great finishing move.  Louie's a pleasure, man.  Thank you so much.  Thanks for having me, fellas.  And you can come back this week with that tape.  I will.  If you're feeling great.  I'd love to hear that.  Sure.  All right.  It does take some guts.  It does take some guts.  I'll enjoy it.  As long as it's funny.  It's fine.  Actually, Wednesday would be the day, because Voss is coming in.  Because know what happens?  I don't know if I can do Wednesday.  I think that's the day I'm chaperoning my daughter's trip. 
[03:55:00]  Aw.  Yeah.  Where is it?  You don't have to say exactly.  Yeah, I don't know exactly.  We're taking her to see some show of some kind.  A show?  The school's taking kids to see a show.  We used to always just go to the Museum of Natural History.  That was our big hop on the bus from Long Island.  Drive out there and walk around and look at the dinosaur bones.  I know that place too well for my kids.  Oh, yeah.  It's just a hot, sweaty walkthrough.  Especially when you go there with your coats on, and you're carrying her coat, and my coat,
