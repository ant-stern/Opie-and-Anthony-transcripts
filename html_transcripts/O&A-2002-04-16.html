<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with rambling, nonsensical conversation before launching into promotions for their "WOW" bumper sticker campaign and Jim Norton's upcoming Town Hall show, teasing a planned on-stage stunt with him.  A substantial portion focused on accusations against another radio show for allegedly copying their "Cribs" segment, featuring visits to the often-crappy homes of show personalities.  The hosts expressed outrage at the other show's hypocrisy, and numerous callers weighed in on the dispute.  Opie then recounted a disastrous television delivery experience, describing the damage inflicted by careless deliverymen and his subsequent struggles with the cable company. This led to further caller interaction.  He also shared a frustrating experience at the DMV, detailing bureaucratic hassles. The show concluded this section with a brief mention and playing of a "Bitches That'll Get You" segment featuring Jeff Gordon, tying it back to the DMV story, all while Jim Norton remained in studio.

The next segment featured a caller's humorous account of aggressively obtaining documents from a leasing company, including a jokingly violent threat. This transitioned into a highly offensive and misogynistic discussion of Jeff Gordon's contentious divorce, filled with crude language targeting Brooke Gordon and her lawyer. The hosts and callers debated the fairness of the financial settlement, with a caller, "Pat," offering a counter-argument mentioning Brooke Gordon's role in Jeff Gordon's career and suggesting his infidelity. The conversation devolved into further offensive remarks, discussions of various sexual preferences and fetishes (including a detailed discussion of a "balloon fetish" and a website mention), and calls to the "F.U." line.  A stunt pilot, Paul, also called in to discuss an upcoming stunt and his own divorce.

The show then veered into a bizarre discussion of enemas, followed by a phone call with "Tom" from New Orleans promoting "Whip It Out Wednesday," which escalated into a highly offensive and profane argument between Tom and "Frenchie," laced with homophobic and misogynistic slurs. The conversation continued with discussions about the anxieties of having sex with deceased relatives watching, delving into graphic sexual descriptions.  A call with "Allison," who used sexually suggestive language to request Jim Norton show tickets, followed.  The hosts then debated John Edwards and psychic abilities in relation to deceased relatives witnessing sex, leading to further explicit and offensive jokes, particularly targeting homosexual sex acts. The segment covered controversial music videos on MTV and MTV2, interspersed with offensive anecdotes.  The segment ended with clips reacting to a Maury Povich show, featuring highly offensive and dehumanizing commentary about children with physical deformities, and more "F*** You" line audio.  The Iron Sheik made a brief unintelligible appearance.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a highly offensive and comedic critique of the Maury Povich Show, referring to it as a "modern day freak show" and mocking children with physical challenges using extremely crude and derogatory language.  The hosts created a demeaning ranking system of children's physical abnormalities and speculated on Maury's actions towards them. They also used offensive terms while desperately searching for dwarfs and midgets for the next day's show, prompted by a promise to Dennis Leary and *The Job* cast, even referencing a past incident involving a dwarf stripper described as near "rape." The segment concluded by mocking an upcoming Maury Povich Show episode titled "Please don't stare, we are not monsters yet,"  followed by the "What Do We Learn" segment featuring similarly vulgar listener calls.

It is like 90 effing degrees in New York City today.  I love it.  And anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  Right off the bat, WOW is tomorrow.  You guys are absolutely insane if you don't spend today and early tomorrow getting the WOW 
[00:02:30]  on your vehicle.  Yeah, it's going to be the biggest WOW day.  I think tomorrow is going to just be insane as far as whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  Not whip it out Wednesday, Tom.  I didn't put that on the station.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, but tomorrow is the big effing day as far as WOW goes.  Oh, yeah.  Make sure you get a WOW bumper sticker. 
[00:03:00]  If you can't get one between now and tomorrow, then make a homemade one.  We love the homemade WOW signs.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  And we have our intern rock star over here stuffing the envelopes with the WOW sticker.  So, if you need one, just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to 888 7th Avenue, New York,  New York, 10106.  And we'll send out a New York version of the WOW sticker, okay?  Certainly.  All right.  Certainly.  Hello, Jimmy.  How are you?  Jim Norton.  How's little Jimmy?  Oh. 
[00:03:30]  Frisky.  Oh.  Playing Town Hall Thursday.  Yeah.  Is it sold out yet?  Is it sold out yet?  It's only two days away.  As of yesterday, there were 57 tickets left.  That's all I'm having.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  And when's the...  Oh, look at that.  Look at that date just creeping on up, ain't it?  Yeah.  Hope it long now.  Yeah.  And now you're going to be there?  Yes.  We want to do our thing on stage.  Did we work that out?  What do you guys want to do?  I don't care. 
[00:04:00]  Our thing.  What's the thing?  I'll make a little sign to you.  Oh.  All right.  The thing.  Are we allowed to do the thing?  47.  We can do the thing.  Whatever you want to do, that you'll be on the show with me.  37.  Whatever you want.  We want to do the thing, though.  To open up the whole night at Town Hall.  The thing.  You know, the thing.  Rick, can we set up the thing?  Yeah.  Will the people at Town Hall have a problem with the thing?  Oh, I don't know.  Who cares?  I don't think so.  It's not a gig I'm doing once a week. 
[00:04:30]  I had to go in there once.  Were they going to do Buddhist all out?  All right.  Who cares?  Well, we'll see you all at Town Hall Thursday with Jim Norton.  And hey, everybody.  You want to have fun?  Here's what I like to do.  I like to walk by somebody's office and I look in and I go, hey, working hard or hardly working?  Sometimes I'll say either.  Who knows?  You're like the company jokester.  Yeah, yeah.  The funny guy.  Hey, you want some material?  Come to where I work.  Why should I go to where you work?  I've been getting that for almost 13 years. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, you want to hear some funny stuff?  Come to my job.  Hey, don't talk about this on the show Monday.  Don't worry.  You don't have to worry about it.  Oh, it's the worst.  All right.  We're going to try to set up the thing for Town Hall, though.  The thing.  They're telling you a boring story.  Two people are like, uh-oh, he's getting material.  The thing.  No, I'm not.  Hey, Paul.  What's going on?  Douche nozzles.  What's up?  Ha.  Listen, why do I got to hear Otto and George whoring themselves all over the radio on 
[00:05:30]  a certain radio show this morning?  They were awful.  Well, now you know why Otto and George haven't been on our show in a while.  Ha.  Bombed.  Tell the old man on the other side of the dial to get original.  He's done, finished, and now apparently he's copying you guys by doing a certain cribs  tool.  What do you mean, cribs?  We've been doing a radio version of Cribs for a while.  I don't know what you mean.  It's an...  Apparently, there's another radio show personality or host or star or whatever you want to say 
[00:06:00]  that's going to do another Cribs.  I don't know which one of his cast of characters he's going to do a Cribs with, but apparently  he's...  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Well, first of all, Cribs is an MTV thing, as we all know.  Yeah.  Right.  But Ant and I have put our own spin on it, and we do Cribs as far as...  We do Cribs with some of the characters that are associated with the Opie and Anthony show.  Some of the characters that may not have a nice crib or have a lot of money.  I think it's a lot funnier when we've done Cribs with Jim Norton, and his apartment is 
[00:06:30]  far and awful.  We did it with Stalker Patty.  Awful.  And she's living with her fellow foundlings, so that's why it was funny to tape Stalker  Patty Cribs.  It's funnier than with rich people, you know?  You can just go in and look at crap.  Why, um, is, uh, is he doing this?  Yeah, apparently a certain radio host, you know, we all know who it is, is doing a Cribs  on, I didn't catch all of it, but on one of his cast of characters. 
[00:07:00]  So, uh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Power of the leader.  Oh, I think, uh...  Oh, boy.  I think everyone knows where that came from, I hope.  Well...  It's very simple.  If you go...  I gotta say this.  If you go your entire radio career claiming that people have done nothing but rip you off,  if everybody that's on the radio that's doing anything besides just playing music, they crack 
[00:07:30]  the mic, maybe they're doing comedy or just talking or doing a bit like Cribs, um, and  you're claiming that everybody is ripping you off, how do you then take something that has  been done on the radio before by Opie and Anthony, our original version of it, and take it verbatim  and then still claim that you're being, you're the one that's being pilfered and ripped off.  And make believe that no one else has done it yet. 
[00:08:00]  Like, I could care...  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't...  If...  There are plenty of people all over doing the wow thing, we goof on them because they try  to present it like an original thing, but there's nothing...  We're not gonna sit here and whine about it, that, oh, we're being ripped off.  But if you're the guy that your whole career has been, uh, uh, saying how other people on  the air have ripped you off, how do you explain this one?  And, and to the, to the minions who would, uh, call up other radio shows, uh, because, 
[00:08:30]  uh, he has told you that, that these other radio shows are clones and rip-offs and, and  then you, you preach, uh, what, what this guy has told you, how, how does the, how does  this stick with you?  That, that, now, uh, he's doing cribs?  We, we did the crib thing.  We did, we did, we took the MTV idea, we turned it around to, to focus on people that 
[00:09:00]  have crappy homes that are involved with our program.  We take the radio show there, we take the cameras there, it's up on the websites, we have  done this, it is documented, we have done this.  We're doing our third version, uh, Thursday, matter of fact.  Right, Thursday, we're doing it again.  We're doing, uh, Sandy Kane cribs, Anthony.  So how do you then keep claiming that you're being ripped off?  Doesn't that just kinda, I don't know, take away a little bit of your credibility?  Am I wrong here? 
[00:09:30]  What are we, you know, it's kinda how I see it.  You can go to foundrymusic.com and see the, uh, the first two cribs we did.  If you claim people are ripping off, I don't see how you can then take anyone's idea from,  from the radio.  I don't get it.  Eh, go to foundrymusic.com and you can see stalker Patty Cribs and Lil Jimmy, uh, Norton's  Cribs.  Don from Philly, Cribs will be on the Black Midget Beetlejuice.  Well, that's pretty, uh, a lot of people checking in on that.  I'm sure, uh, it would be a great little thing, see how he lives, but it's, it's something 
[00:10:00]  that we have done on this program.  Um, and I, I just think that we ought to point it out.  If we're gonna be accused of being the clones and the rip-offs, I think what we should point  out these, these instances that come up, um, and this hasn't been the first one, where  he's doing something that, that we just did. 
[00:10:30]  Ugh, I don't, I don't get it.  Oh.  All right.  Whatever.  Let's go to James.  Hey, James, what's going on, bro?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Check this out.  I know you don't care that Otto and George is on another show, right?  Well, we, but we, uh, we handle that stuff differently with everybody.  We understand that, uh, a lot of the people that you know and love from our show, they have  to do their thing and they have to go on other radio shows to sell, sell, uh, tickets  and, uh, and sell whatever they, they want to sell.  We understand that.  We, we don't play that game with our guests. 
[00:11:00]  But we, we like to think, we like to think, uh, that these people know where they're, you  know, that how loyal we are to them, though.  You know, but the only thing that really pissed me off, you know, I listen to Howard, too.  I listen to you guys.  Sure.  But, but, um, you know, Otto goes, uh, you know, Howard, you're the only one in radio  that's ever helped me.  And that's kind of jacked up because I've heard him on your sky show.  Oh, my God.  I don't say that.  That sounds like, uh, a desperate man.  I mean, Otto's been on our show probably, I would guess, close to 10 times. 
[00:11:30]  Uh, we helped him out a lot.  He started using our name in all his advertising, saying Otto and George from the Opie and Anthony  show.  Uh, I think we sold, uh, a lot of, uh, tickets as far as people going to see Otto and George.  And if, if that's how he feels now, what can I tell you?  What can I tell you?  Oh, man, he bombed anyway.  I mean, I think our listeners, uh, know, you know, know what's up.  You know, they've heard him, uh, kill on our show and now he's going to claim that, uh,  we never helped him out.  Well, I don't know.  I feel sorry for him, actually. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  I'm going to ask.  Well, thank you.  Joe from Philly on the instant feedback.  Uh, Joe, if, if we owe him our, our careers, so shut the F up, uh, as you say, how do you  explain this, Joe?  What's the matter?  You know, how is this different, Joe from Philly?  Here it is.  It's right out there, right out there for you to see.  How do you explain it?  It's something we've done on this show. 
[00:12:30]  We have been accused of being the clones and the ripoffs.  So, uh, what we do, even though we come up with original ideas for this program, so we  can go on and do things that are the Opie and Anthony show.  And, um, you know, what we have done on the radio speaks for itself.  We have come up with so many original ideas.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, well, you know, we don't even have to sell people that.  And at this point, I'm not even going to try to convince people of that.  If you don't, if you don't, if you don't buy that by now, then I don't know what to  tell you. 
[00:13:00]  But I just don't understand how you can then, uh, just grab something we've done very recently.  Something we have scheduled to do again Thursday.  With Sandy Cain.  With Sandy Cain and Twato.  We're going to see how Twato lives.  So, just someone like Joe and all the other people that just have it, you know, it's been  pounded in their heads for so long.  I guess it's, it's hard to detach yourself from it.  But Joe, I mean, it's right out there.  What are you going to do?  It doesn't matter how many instant feedbacks you write or what you say. 
[00:13:30]  We can just turn around and go, look, here it is.  It's a little hypocritical, if you ask me.  But, you know, you can't blame a guy like Joe.  He's been pounded in his head for so long.  No one's really answered back in that many years, I'll be.  All right.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, man, I just shout out pity for that guy this morning.  He was swaying.  I mean, he, everything was all lined out for him.  Right on his, it was scripted. 
[00:14:00]  And, you know, he was saying himself, he's not, he kept saying, I'm not a radio guy.  What, Otto and George?  Yeah, you know, I'm not a radio guy.  I do better on stage.  I can't curse.  But, you know, he sounded a million times better on your show every time.  Well, because we know how to handle Otto and George.  And now, you know, he's decided he doesn't need us.  So, good luck.  There's a, there's a way to deal with Otto and George.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Dealing with Otto and George on a radio show, you can't have any structure, man.  He's just got to sit down and kind of get involved with the conversation.  You can't do an interview with Otto and George. 
[00:14:30]  You can't sit him down and then do an interview with him.  He's got to just be involved with what's going on in the show.  And you got to kind of let him go.  Well, he ain't going to be back on there anytime soon, I don't think.  I don't know.  All right, but we'll welcome him back here.  Of course we will.  Later.  All right.  Thanks, Sean.  Why don't we take a break and start the Opie and Anthony show for today.  We're very excited about tomorrow.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  The most original radio idea ever. 
[00:15:00]  Ever.  You can take that to the bank.  Yeah.  Prove to us that we stole that from somewhere, you idiots.  Had something to do with a bandana wrapped around an antenna, Opie.  Of course.  I believe.  Tomorrow is going to be huge as far as WOW goes.  So make sure you get your WOW stickers or your homemade WOW signs on your car for tomorrow's festivities.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  And a quick break and then we'll do a real show.  So stay there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'll see you at the 9th. 
[00:15:30]  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'll see you at...  Oh, I was just going to be crazy.  So is that my name?  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  I don't have to.  No, she's going to answer something.  W...  W-4.  I'm nuts this morning.  I'm about to read.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and you're listening to...  It'll be Opie and Anthony on the rock station.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.

[00:17:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  Executioners with Lincoln Park.  It's going down.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, excuse me.  Casey.  Casey from 24th Street has a little problem, Opie.  His problem seems to be he's effing retarded.  I'll read his instant feedback.  Prove it.  Are you kidding? 
[00:17:30]  Are you guys so effing full of yourselves that you can't remember the show where you discussed at length taking the wow concept from a Florida radio station  where it was called something like Show the Puppies?  This was less than 18 months ago, guys.  I love your show and don't care who you are or aren't copying.  But you admit to something yourself on the air.  Don't deny it a year later.  For God's sake, butch off. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, hey, asswipe.  The wow thing.  Didn't we just say the other day how we were talking about an article that was in the Boston last winter?  The Boston Globe from 19, what was that, 95 or 6?  You ass.  Casey, you jack off.  Do you listen?  Do you listen?  You thought you did 18 months ago?  We've been doing wow for, I think this is the seventh summer. 
[00:18:30]  Years, jerk off.  The United Florida station where it's called Show the Puppies.  Go, go die.  This is our seventh year of wow.  What an ass.  He thinks 18 months ago we said that we got it from a Florida radio station.  Maybe it's some other madcap comedy show you've been listening to.  Not this one, Casey.  A lot of stations have taken the concept and just changed the name to flip them out Fridays.  Tom Likas, he has a version of it that he came up with a few years back. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, you idiot.  What a, I read that one.  I'm like, why?  This guy is a tool.  A twat tool.  I love when people mouth off or write in or something and, and they, they have no idea what they're talking about.  All their facts are wrong, but they're so adamant about it.  So like, Ooh, this is what I think.  And this based on these facts and you have it completely wrong.  Casey, jerk off. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  We're going to move on now, Anthony.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  And you can look up the article for yourself if you don't believe it.  Yeah.  Boston Globe wrote about, uh, wow.  It might be 96.  I think.  Eileen McNamara for the Boston Globe.  Look it up yourself, Casey, if you don't believe us.  God, I feel sorry for a lot of, uh, uh, uh, the people that are writing it on instant feedback that are having such a hard time swallowing the truth. 
[00:20:00]  It's very hard for them.  Very difficult.  And they're trying to work their way through it, Opie.  All right.  I, on the, on the other hand, don't bother with the instant feedback when it comes to idiots.  I want to thank, uh, the two, uh, gorillas for delivering my TV today.  What happened?  What happened?  Holy ass.  Now I got to hire, I think, a cleaning crew.  TV, very delicate piece of equipment, Opie. 
[00:20:30]  I understand that, you know, maybe, you know, it's not your apartment so you don't give a flying F.  Right.  And it's 90 degrees out and, and your life sucks and this is what you do for a living.  But come on, help me out here.  I didn't do anything wrong to you guys.  I, it looks like a, like a, a tornado hit my apartment.  All I wanted was a TV delivered.  Did they know who you were?  Huh?  Did they know who you were?  Uh, no, because it probably would have been worse.  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking they, they knew not to expect a tip. 
[00:21:00]  I tipped them, too.  No, I did tip them.  You did?  Yeah.  You worm.  I tipped them because I was scared if I didn't tip them that they would now know where I live  and they'd come back for their own tip.  You know how that works.  That's called extortion.  I felt extorted today, Anthony.  These guys could have played for, uh, the, the, the Jets line.  Really?  Two huge monsters. 
[00:21:30]  I decided to get a, uh, a really, really big picture tube TV.  Oh!  Using some of that 130 mil.  Nice.  And, uh, I, I know the thing weighs a ton.  Yeah.  All right?  How big, how big is the screen?  Uh, I went with a 40 inch, uh, picture tube.  Oh, okay.  From Sony.  Yeah.  Those are the best picture tubes.  Nice.  Huh?  Those are, picture tubes are the best, right?  Uh, as far as quality, I think, and, you know, whatever.  They have some very, very nice big screen, uh, TVs now. 
[00:22:00]  It's not like the older days where you're sitting on the side and you can't see it anymore.  There are some very nice big screen TVs now that are in tubes.  Very nice ones.  It's changed a lot, you're saying.  It has.  Technology, Mr. Norton.  So, uh, these two gorillas, yeah, pull up to my place and they pretty much just kind of  drop the TV off the, the back of the truck because it weighs a lot, Anthony.  God forbid they have more than two guys, uh, trying to move something that weighs, I think,  350 to 400 pounds. 
[00:22:30]  Now, you're like, oh my God, this delicate piece of equipment.  Oh, yeah.  They just roll it out the back of the truck and then proceed to roll it into my apartment.  On a, uh, dolly?  No!  What?  End over end.  No, stop.  Get that.  Wait a minute.  My TV.  Wait, wait, wait.  They took your TV.  Yeah.  And rolled it like a square wheel?  Yeah.  And you let them do this more than once?  Dude, they were 6'6", 3...  Oh my God, did you plug it in? 
[00:23:00]  350 a piece.  Does it work?  I, I don't know yet.  Oh my God.  I just wanted them to leave.  Did you notice on the box it says this side up and fragile?  Well, Ant, uh, I'm not good at, uh, reading things upside down.  All right?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  So, so they rolled the TV into my place.  Now, I figured this out.  Now, the place I got the TV from, uh, great place, you know?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Uh, but they, I, I guess they, they, uh, they give the work to a moving company, Anthony.  You know, some of these moving companies, I'm not talking about all moving companies,  because now the instant feedback will go crazy about that.  But a lot of moving companies, they don't really, they don't really care.  Yeah.  You know, they don't really care.  They got a lot of deliveries, and they're going to try to do it as fast as they can.  You know?  That, that, but that isn't right, end over end?  End over end.  No.  And it was in kind of like styrofoam, uh, styrofoam, and the styrofoam is just flying everywhere, 
[00:24:00]  okay?  And then, uh, it comes in a box, this TV, that they decided they didn't need the box,  you know, to move it into the apartment.  Uh, uh.  So the box is outside the apartment, okay?  They didn't take the box away?  No, they just got, no, no, they're supposed to load it back up in the truck.  They fold it up, take the box away.  They just got, no, they took the TV out of the box, it still had some styrofoam, uh,  around it, and then rolled it into the apartment.  Wait, wait, wait!  I'm telling you, man.  It wasn't even in the box as they rolled it? 
[00:24:30]  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  All right?  What are you talking, is it all scratched up?  Well, they had a little, uh, little plastic baggie around it.  I might have a real problem.  I swear to God.  Why didn't you just tell those faggots to stop rolling it that way?  Because they, they were 6'6", 350 pounds each.  Oh.  Yeah, I would hope each, because that would be bad if it was a combination. 
[00:25:00]  Two, three, three men.  So now this box, now this box, uh, now this box is outside my apartment, and this box  is almost as big as this studio.  I've never seen a bigger box in my life.  The box itself has to weigh close to 100 pounds.  Just the box.  If I put this box on a scale, I think it would weigh close to 100 pounds.  Well, they're supposed to take all that debris away.  No, their excuse was, you know, you should plug it in and make sure it works and stuff. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, because after we rolled it up the, uh, up the stairs or.  Yeah, and then he goes, and then if it works, then you could throw the box away.  And I'm like, but, but I thought you would, and they're just gone.  So now I got this box outside my apartment that is huge.  Oh, man.  I know a homeless guy's going to try to live in this day.  Yeah, they love the, the nice boxes, although it's summer, so.  So I want to thank, uh, the fine folks for, uh, rolling my TV into my apartment today.  Now, you got to plug it in to see if it works.  Huh?  You got to plug it in to see if it works now. 
[00:26:00]  You should have someone do that because they're going to give you the runaround.  Well, I need another.  The longer you have it at the house after delivery, they're going to go, well, it wasn't us.  Well, I need a, uh, uh, another cable box, Anthony.  So I, I, I can't plug it in to see if I get channels because I don't have another cable box right now.  So I, I was calling the cable company.  That was another nightmare in itself.  Oh, you pay for cable?  No, you got to get those illegal, but, oh, now I sound like Sid from The Fan over here in New York.  For those of you in other cities, there's a guy on a radio station here in New York City that got on the air. 
[00:26:30]  On Imus' show.  Yeah, on Imus' show that got on the air.  Actually, he's a nice guy.  We like the guy.  He fessed up to stealing satellite service for his TV and, and the company turned on him and then I was suing him.  What an ass.  Isn't that hysterical?  He goes, oh, you pay for that?  And I was like, yeah, you know, I got to the, um, uh, uh, satellite, um, television to, um, uh, watch, uh, TV.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, McCord, jerk. 
[00:27:00]  And he, he gets on and just starts going, and he's going, oh, you pay for, no, I don't pay.  I have a guy, he gets the card, they slip it in, uh, I don't pay.  Sometimes I got to go back to the guy when they zap it and get the, and he spilled it out on national radio, how you steal satellite service for, uh, his TV.  Wow.  And even Imus was like, you know, what is wrong with you?  Um, Sid, why don't you, um.  Shut up.  Um, shut up.  Because, um, that's, uh, yeah, yeah, that's a theft of, um, uh, service. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  How's your Donkey Kong, baby?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  And he just spelled, he spelled it out, the whole thing.  Yeah.  So you need another cable box.  Yeah, and then I called the cable company, and, uh, you know, all I wanted was a live voice.  Oh, yeah, he's in the office.  I didn't know I had to be good with the touchpad.  It was quiet time in the office, because Opie was on the phone trying to circumnavigate this. 
[00:28:00]  No, tell people why it was quiet time.  Why?  Because I was ready to lose my effing mind.  Yeah.  And break my phone.  And break the phone again.  For the fifth or sixth time.  Because all I wanted was, how long does, how long should it take to call up a cable company  and go, hey, got a TV, need another box?  I already have the service.  You know, they install another box, it's 20, 30 bucks, I guess, and then it's five bucks extra a month.  Whatever.  They didn't give you the option to hit zero for the operator? 
[00:28:30]  No.  I don't think so.  I was so confused, and then I was so deep into their system, I didn't know where I was.  Whenever I get that.  So then I had to start over.  No, whenever you get that, zero.  And then I pushed a button, and next thing you know, the instructions are in Spanish.  I'm like, what did I do wrong here?  So then I gave the lady, the poor lady, that.  If you're a peeler, press one.  You're right.  But it's never the option you need.  No, of course not.  You know what I mean?  They have five or six other options. 
[00:29:00]  It's none of those, so then they say, push seven to go back to the beginning, and then you push seven.  I always go to an operator.  Yep.  Always.  But they figured out how to get away from that.  Usually you just pause and don't press anything, because I'll assume you have rotary.  But now they say, speak your selection.  So you have to go with one or two.  You can't do that anymore.  And then you get the operator, finally.  Hi, this is Cherise, may I help you?  And I'm like, could you put me back to the push-button thing, please? 
[00:29:30]  Come on.  It's customer service.  Thank you, nice lady.  It's customer service, and it ain't.  And I'm just stupid out of my mind, though.  Because, you know, most normal people would just hang up.  All right.  Well, whatever.  But when I get annoyed, I just have to keep going and going and going.  Oh, it becomes a mission.  And see, and then I try to figure out where my boiling point is, and these guys are, like,  talking about Tyson or, I don't know, working on a bit for the show, and I'm just losing  my mind.  You guys all could tell that I'm within seconds of just destroying something. 
[00:30:00]  Losing your mind.  Because it should have taken two minutes, not 15 like it did.  You were being offered a trip, and you didn't even know.  A trip?  You were on the phone.  You were being offered a trip to the Tyson fight in Memphis.  Oh, I committed.  I want to go.  I'm a little frightened, but I want to go.  I want to see that.  I think it would be cool.  I'm just waiting to get into the hotel room.  Hello, Anthony.  Hi. 
[00:30:30]  Room service.  It's me, Mike Tyson.  I was in New York listening to your program, and I thought it was very funny.  And now Mike is going to get accused of another hotel rape, and it's going to be you, funny  man.  Yeah, how funny would it be if we're at the Tyson-Lewis fight in Memphis, right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, Tyson stops fighting because he sees you in the audience.  Someone points you out.  He goes, you know that guy that's been making fun of you in New York for all those years?  There he is, right there.  Oh, that head looks like a tasty tidbit. 
[00:31:00]  I'm just going to wait in his hotel room, laying in the bed with the sheets up to my big  breakfasts.  And then I'll just wait for Anthony.  Hi, Anthony.  Welcome.  Go to the minibar, grab me a beverage, and then I'll F you in the A until you love me.  Hey, Joe.  What's going on?  Joe, Opie.  Yeah.  I work for Sony.  That TV is shot.  Ah, Lizzie, it's shot.  Well, someone is saying that.  Here, let me explain.  Okay.  Wait, I think 32 inches and above have almost what's, it's kind of like a liquid like mercury 
[00:31:30]  inside the tube.  Yeah.  And when you turn that TV end over end, you mix it together.  You're going to get a rainbow color on any picture on that TV.  It's shot.  Don't tell me this.  No, I'm telling you that.  Because they rolled it end over, end over, end over, end.  No, that's why the boxes are.  It was probably, they probably did two full rotations.  That's really, really bad.  Thank you, Joe.  The best you can hope for.  Hey, help me out here, because Lance of Line 7 is saying no TV is that heavy. 
[00:32:00]  How heavy is the 40-inch picture tube from Sony?  Roughly 225 pounds.  Okay.  Wow.  I was off, but someone told me like 3, 3, 350.  Yeah.  Now, I wouldn't even plug it in until tomorrow.  Let it sit.  This is what you need to do.  Let it sit.  And then call the tech line tomorrow morning.  Tell them that Joe Pantaleono called.  Joey Vance.  And told you.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, mister?  Click. 
[00:32:30]  You gotcha.  I got a Sony 2, but no one rolled mine because it's got wheels on it.  And the nice orthodox man with the box cutter rolled it in like a gentleman.  Oh, yeah?  No, it's funny, because I was telling Norton the story while we were in commercials, and  I said, they rolled my TV into my apartment.  He goes, oh, it has wheels, too?  I'm like, no, mine doesn't have wheels.  That's the problem.  No, they just rolled it.  Opie, is that your delivery guy on line one?  Uh, uh, the, hey, delivery guy.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  It's the Vita.  I tried to do a good job rolling your TV, and I thought Norton would be the best way 
[00:33:00]  to do it.  Sorry about that.  I'll try harder next time.  Talk to you soon.  I hope I can give you a happy ending someday.  Love you.  All right, Devita.  Was Devita one of the, uh, delivery, uh, no?  I don't know.  Maybe, uh, Devita's tanning lately.  Eddie, what's up?  What's up with, Opie?  Listen, you have to keep the box.  Why?  Because if there is a problem with that TV, the place where you bought it will not take  it back unless packed back into the box. 
[00:33:30]  I'm telling you, I worked for a...  How am I going to get it back into the box?  Well, roll it back like they did it.  Oh, good.  I'm telling you, you'll see on the instructions that you have to keep the box for at least a  month.  The box is outside.  Stop it.  There's no...  I'm telling you, get a hold of Sandy.  These people are hysterical.  You mean to tell me that if there's something...  You're not working the store.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Eddie.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  You mean to tell me there's some loophole in the consumer laws that says if you don't  save the box, that if you got a crap piece of equipment, you can't bring it back. 
[00:34:00]  You cannot bring it back.  Oh, shut up, Eddie.  Listen.  Hold on.  Eddie, there's nowhere to store this box.  It's the biggest box I've ever seen.  Let me finish my story, Opie, please.  Don't make me call the five on your side, guys.  Well, you can call them...  Listen.  They want the store to take it back unless you have the box.  That's the whole problem.  It's the store.  It's not the manufacturer.  All right.  There's already a landscaping family living in it.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  From Honduras.  Well, get a hold of Sandy.  Bring the box into the hallway. 
[00:34:30]  Rent a storage space, but you have to keep it for a month, okay?  I wouldn't...  Eddie, I don't even want to deal with Sandy because she's a neat freak and these animals  pretty much destroyed everything in their way to get the TV in the living room.  I had an air conditioner.  There's like...  It's going from my own place.  All right, all right, Eddie.  Thank you.  That's a fascinating story.  That'd be great.  I had an air conditioner once and it was broken.  The walls, all the paint is all chipped.  The wood floor is all just effed up from the hand truck. 
[00:35:00]  They hurt her wood floor?  I had an air conditioner and they dropped it on my foot and my head came apart.  When they decided they didn't need the hand truck and they kind of just rolled it along  the wood floor, like kind of just tossed it aside.  Nothing better than movers pushing something across the wood floor and just seeing shavings  like a wood chipper flying out from the legs.  I'm like, thanks, I think.  Opie Dan from Hoboken says, stop your bitching, Opie.  Eighteen months ago, you admitted you had two cable boxes. 
[00:35:30]  Stop doing the fake radio.  Yeah, I hope I'm not ripping anyone off by having a TV delivered.  Dude, I make people take their shoes off when they walk into my apartment.  Oh, now?  I've never had a place that wasn't filthy and disgusting.  Yeah.  This place is at least clean.  I'm like, I'm not screwing this up.  Oh, yeah, it'll happen.  It'll happen.  I'm like, take your shoes off.  And if any mover drags somebody across my floor, I would have him.  You'd just have him.  Jake, what's up?  I would have him.  I've been, I'm an owner of life.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, mister. 
[00:36:00]  Hold on, you could say a-hole, I guess.  Wait a minute.  They say that, I've heard that.  I know.  It doesn't make sense.  For some reason, they dump out of that.  Yeah, so it's-  Why wouldn't you open your mouth to these guys?  And I am sure you paid over two, well over two grand for that TV.  Um, yeah, I got a pretty good deal.  I did all right with that.  Oh, now it makes sense.  Now it makes sense.  Jeff from Philly pointed the whole thing out.  You know who the delivery guy was?  You didn't recognize her. 
[00:36:30]  It was Kathleen Turner.  And she was a little pissed off.  Hi, everybody.  My name is Paul.  Oh, wait.  Ah, shut up.  What?  I was going to play a bit.  Whoops.  Wrong CD.  Wrong CD.  That's great.  Hi, I'm OJ.  That was not awesome. 
[00:37:00]  Might as well have a table of OJ killing someone.  Love me.  I just felt like playing something there.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God.  Again, Dan, just by your description, Opie, I could tell not only is your TV broken, rolling  a TV through your apartment, zapped all the electronics, opened a rift in the space-time  continuum, and spread anthrax in your carpet.  People overreact so much.  Dude, they rolled it in?  Yeah, the TV's gone, man. 
[00:37:30]  It's gone.  Ain't no bringing it back.  I'll tell you why I didn't say anything.  First of all, because I was scared of the two guys.  Of course you were.  Second, though, I'm thinking, well, they must deliver a lot of TVs.  No, you don't.  And it's, you know, the technology and the TVs have come a long way.  I guess you could roll them now.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  I swear to God, it went through my head like, if they're rolling it, they know something  I don't know.  It's not the old sets we used to watch Uncle Miltie on.  Right.  You know?  Very delicate with the tubes.  Remember, there's a big cabinet. 
[00:38:00]  Your grandmother had the one with a big cabinet.  The console televisions.  It was the big wood thing, like they used to give away on Let's Make a Deal and whatnot,  where they'd open up the curtain.  A brand new television set.  And it's a color TV from Zenith.  And it was a big wooden sarcophagus.  And it had a TV in it.  And maybe an eight-track player and a stereo.  It was like an entertainment center.  And it weighed 2,000 pounds.  And there was no way you were moving that thing.  You would have to roll it end over end. 
[00:38:30]  Yes, Jimmy?  No, I had nothing.  I was just thinking of having fond memories of what my grandmother used to have one of  those movies in it.  It just reminded me of it.  Reminded it, too.  And then she was buried in it.  Years later.  It's very handy.  Yeah.  I've had it through a whole life.  Anyone needs a box to bury their loved one, I got it.  Everything from using it as a little changing table for my own mom to her own burial casket.  Those things were handy-dandy.  But sometimes if she would leak on the top of it, you'd have to bash her in the jaw. 
[00:39:00]  She grew to enjoy those times we spent together.  Punching old grandma on her glass chin.  She'd always go down.  Would you stop that and just finish?  Oh, God!  All right.  Jason.  Jason, go ahead.  Hello.  Jason.  He's driving, Opie.  Dude, you're right there.  The guy I'm talking to.  Hey, it's you.  Yeah, guys.  What's your name?  Hold on.  I mean, this guy's using a slowest oil, so I couldn't hear a thing. 
[00:39:30]  This story is so reminded me of the DMV story.  You guys got to play it into a commercial for all the new syndicated cities who haven't gotten yet to enjoy that beautiful piece of radio.  Opie never has an easy time dealing with services.  Never.  It doesn't matter who they are.  I'm the same way.  That's why I find this stuff so funny.  Oh, it doesn't matter who they are.  Whether they're delivering televisions, trying to give them a token for the subway, whether they're at motor vehicle.  Well, because service people.  French people 60 feet under. 
[00:40:00]  I'm going to generalize, and I'm sorry, but I have to say it's service people blow.  Right.  I'll tell you something else that happened.  I didn't even know I was getting the TV delivered today.  I had a conversation with a guy from this fine establishment.  Let's say his name is Joe.  I go, Joe, this is what I want.  I need it delivered.  And he goes, you know, I think I could.  Well, I wanted it delivered last week.  He goes, I think I could get it delivered Tuesday.  So I'll call you to confirm that we're delivering it Tuesday.  I never got a confirmation call. 
[00:40:30]  So now I'm assuming, OK, because he was going to build a special stand for and stuff.  He's, you know, he's that nice.  Threw that in.  Little side thing.  Look at this.  Special stand?  So, uh, shut up, douche.  Have a little mirror in there.  Special.  So.  Your cologne.  So he never called.  So I'm assuming, all right, maybe he needs another day for the stand or whatever.  Yeah.  So I'll call him today and see what's going on.  Maybe it's going to be delivered tomorrow.  Where did the stand have down syndrome?  Shut up.  So Joe's not working today, Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I get the customer service lady on the phone, and I explain exactly what I said to you,  how Joe said that it looks like Tuesday, but he's not sure.  He'll confirm.  She doesn't know nothing.  She goes, I've been working here six years that we never confirm.  If Joe said it's Tuesday, it's going to definitely be Tuesday.  I'm like, look, lady, I don't know, you know, about other people.  I'm telling you, I talked to Joe, and he told me he will definitely call me on my cell phone  to confirm when my TV is going to be delivered. 
[00:41:30]  Right away, she's, you know, down my throat.  Right.  Like, oh, that's not how we do things here, and I've been here six years.  They're snotty.  Real snotty.  They know better than you.  Yeah.  I'm like, look, lady, I just had the conversation with him Friday.  He said he would call me on my cell phone if this is definitely going to happen today.  Well, it is definitely happening today.  Well, thanks for letting me know.  I've got to go to work now.  Adam says you didn't say anything to the delivery guys because you don't have a panic room yet in your place. 
[00:42:00]  Are you going to build a panic room?  All of a sudden, Opie runs in, slams the door, shushes to me.  Hi.  It's me from inside the panic room.  What?  Hey, gorilla.  Why are you rolling my television set?  Don't hold up that FU sign in front of the camera.  I can see it perfectly.  Yeah, I'm brave when I'm behind steel and cement.  You're going to get a panic room?  I might need one. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  You want to pull it?  We can play the little DMV thing, Anthony.  Yes.  Sounds like those Bud Light commercials.  Yeah, when we moved back to New York from Boston, I had to change my license after three years.  Yeah, I did the same thing.  After three years, I said, you know what?  Maybe I shouldn't go around with mass plates and a mass license.  When we were up in Boston, I had my New York license for three years.  So when I got down here, I did what?  How do you get your stuff? 
[00:43:00]  I got to do that now.  How do you do that?  You just go to Motor Vehicle.  No, no, no, no.  But like before you change, don't they keep mailing you stuff to you, to your old address?  Oh.  Yeah, that's if you actually pay for car insurance and stuff.  Yeah.  You could do things.  You could do things online now.  Really?  Yeah, all I know is I think they were sending my insurance bill to my old address, and then  it would get forwarded to me here in New York.  And if you get in an accident, let's say on the Northern State Parkway, I'm traveling. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, you got the mass plates and the mass license.  I'm down here.  It's my mom's birthday.  You know when I finally changed my Massachusetts plates over?  It was Yankees Red Sox series.  I was going to say a Yankee fan made you do it, because I'm a Yankee fan, and I have  these plates on, and a card pulls up next to me, Yankee stuff all over it, and goes,  go F yourself, you F in socks, piece of S. And I'm sitting there going, oh, that's 
[00:44:00]  right, I got Massachusetts plates.  Went right to Motor Vehicle the next day, straighten that out.  I look like a tool Red Sox fan, Ben.  I'd love to have a little special stand for my TV.  He's still on the stand, though.  Put little books in there, maybe.  A little book, maybe.  Maybe a tchotchke.  Maybe a little knick-knack or a tchotchke.  A little hummel.  Imagine having a tchotchke that looked like tchotchie.  It'd be a tchotchie tchotchke. 
[00:44:30]  I always thought Spike was the bigger boy.  All the love and care that they put into my special TV stand was thrown out the window  with these two gorillas just rolling the TV upstairs.  I'd like to attack your new stand with an aluminum bat.  Hey, look what I have here.  Watch that TV with the mercury crash.  You can't just put it on the floor.  Just laugh at you, weeping, tussle your blonde hair.  You don't have, like, a wall unit?  I'm a big fan of the wall unit.  Ah, this is more modern. 
[00:45:00]  I don't like just, no, no, I don't...  It has a couple trays where you put your things.  See, I don't like that space-age crap.  I like a big wooden wall unit that the television sits in the middle,  and on the side there's maybe some glass cabinets, lighted,  so you could open them up, and there's little crystal things in there, maybe.  Maybe a dolphin, if a gal likes it, or an elephant.  Maybe a crystal dolphin.  Or a clown.  Or a little castle.  A bunch of bodies in there, but the house buried under the cement.  A little clown, a little house.  A little guilty clown. 
[00:45:30]  A little dizzy clown.  Sure.  Whatever, knick-knacks, that's what they call them.  Yeah.  You put them up on the shelves, maybe some books,  and then a little cabinet underneath for your DVDs and your videos.  Maybe you can keep a little photo out in there in your special place.  Where are you going to put your DVDs and videos if you have a stand?  Something.  See?  I don't know.  The wall unit takes care of everything.  I don't know.  I'm not good at this stuff.  You can put your journal in a special drawer.  That's why I bring it up.  I'm horrible at it, too. 
[00:46:00]  You should see my place.  Dude, I have a closet full of porn.  I have no place to put videos.  I have no place to put DVDs.  Because I don't like things out.  Right.  I like them enclosed.  They've got to be enclosed.  Because it's dust.  I don't want dust all over the place.  Not only that, but if you have some special guest over,  someday you may not want them to see the porno.  Yeah, I don't need them seeing German films that say caviar on them.  John, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, listen, man.  Don't worry about your TV stand.  Don't worry about the picture tube or anything.  Because you left that box out front so every criminal in your neighborhood 
[00:46:30]  knows you have a new TV.  It's going to be gone by the time you get home.  And a good one at that, too.  Oh, that's right.  It's going to be nice.  Thanks.  Now, you know what?  I'm going to watch it at the pawn shop.  Thanks, John.  I'm going to be thinking about that all day now.  Thank you.  Don't worry.  Got to move it in at night.  Say it's a bassinet.  Oh, remember that bit?  Yeah, what am I doing?  All right.  Well, anyways, as we go to break, I went to DMV here in New York and got my license changed.  And it was just a major effing hassle. 
[00:47:00]  So I told the story on the air, and then Rick took it and made it into kind of like a Bud Light commercial.  Yes.  The old Bud Light commercials with...  With Heston.  With the guy that sounded like Heston.  I don't even know if that was Heston.  I think it was Heston.  Yeah?  All right.  Here it is.  We'll be back.  No, that's not it either, though.  Hold on.  Here it is.  Bitches that'll get you.  Oh, we're doing a Bitches that'll get you?  I don't know.  Why is that in there?  I think we are.  Oh, actually, yeah.  We are.  Oh, my God.  What a great Bitches that'll get you.  Oh, you just reminded me.  Cool. 
[00:47:30]  We'll talk about Jeff Gordon and the Bitches that'll get you next.  Oh, my God.  She's back over her.  Here's the DMV thing.  Today, I'd like to talk to you on a very serious note, because this is the story of a man overcoming  monumental physical pain and suffering.  Because I went to the DMV today, and it was really, really ugly.  There's nothing funny about what you're about to hear.  Everything was organized.  I went in there.  That's such a part of just being like a man.  I was going to motor vehicle and registering.  Not a man.  Work with me, son. 
[00:48:00]  So I get to the lady, and I must say, the nicest DMV lady ever.  Ever.  She wasn't the problem this time.  The last three times, they were the problem.  All right, so she's going through all the forums like, okay, we'll get you out of here  in a jiffy.  Right?  And she's going through all the stuff, and I'm like, all right, finally.  Fourth time going to DMV to get my vehicle registered.  This is it.  I'm finally going to have New York plates.  Let's be told, today's world can be namby-pamby.  All of a sudden, she says, okay, I just need a copy of the title. 
[00:48:30]  Is this the title?  I started panicking.  What to do?  What to do?  So I had to get the leasing company on the line.  This was the last time I went to send me the power of attorney, basically saying it's  okay to register the car in New York State.  All right?  Uh-huh.  You would think that people, when they're sending that, would send a copy of the title  knowing I'm going to need that as well, Anthony.  No, you can't expect them to do that.  So I don't have the title.  So now I can't do it.  So now I'm ready to go home, which means I'd have to go back to the DMV for the fifth time. 
[00:49:00]  No, no, no.  So then the lady sees the panic on my face.  She goes, look, can you get the leasing company to fax it over, the title?  If I get a fax of it, boom, you're out of here in two minutes.  I'm like, no problem.  He realizes he's got to get it.  So I go out in the hall.  It's key to the story that you know I only had 70 cents in my pocket.  I call the leasing company and I explain my situation.  I need the title faxed over to the DMV.  The lady says, I can't do that for you. 
[00:49:30]  You have to talk to Judy.  Judy is busy with another customer.  You'll have to call her back.  Click, hangs up on me.  No, no, no.  I don't have enough money to call damn Judy.  So what do I do?  I drive all the way home.  He figures, what the heck?  And I call Judy and I give her a piece of my mind.  I say, Judy, listen, you have to fax a copy of the title to DMV right now.  Will there be a problem?  She says, oh, no problem at all.  Will you do it now?  She goes, yes. 
[00:50:00]  I go, okay.  I am going to leave my house for the DMV.  I expect that title to be faxed when I get there.  That is beautiful.  All right.  It gets better.  So I go back to the DMV.  Everyone knows now because I was there an hour before or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes staring at the fax machine waiting for a copy of the title to come through.  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later, it's not coming through the fax machine, okay?  He said it would not work.  After 20 minutes away in the DMV, I'm like, okay, there's a problem.  Now I have to make another call. 
[00:50:30]  I don't have any change.  No, no, no.  So I'm at the customer service.  I explain, look, the lady was supposed to fax it 20 minutes ago.  I've been staring at the fax machine.  There's a problem.  I need to use your phone.  She goes, there's a phone in the lobby there or whatever, right?  I said, no, I have one nickel.  I can't make a call.  The lady, supposedly part of customer service, goes, you'll have to talk to a supervisor.  His arm arose.  I go, it's a goddamn phone call.  Give me your phone.  Sir?  You're building bridges.  You're making friends.  Now the real friendly teller heard me screaming at the lady, and she goes, come here. 
[00:51:00]  And she goes, here.  And she hands me a cordless phone.  I go, thank you.  And then I turn to the customer service lady.  I go, was that hard to do?  He got up and got one.  So I call the leasing company again.  I go, hi.  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes?  I've been staring at the fax machine.  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out.  What's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over.  I made a copy of it.  It was too light, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:51:30]  I'm like, will you fax it right now before I come back in here with an automatic weapon and shoot everybody?  And did she?  She did.  She did?  Fifteen minutes later, she sends it over.  You've got moxie.  And don't let anyone ever take that away from you.  And then I paid my $72.50.  So I wrote the check and I got out of there.  Young man, do you ever look back and wonder what would have happened if you'd just given up, if you hadn't followed your dream?  I took five trips to DMV to get my license and my registration.  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this. 
[00:52:00]  You've showed us that while no man is an island, one man can make a difference.  And now I'm registered in New York.  Pretty cool.  I'd say you are very cool.  A very cool cat, indeed.  Who else gives you a bus filled with naked teens that you can see from the streets of Manhattan?  What a day for new teens!  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest the voyeur bus.  Juliani, read it! 
[00:52:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  A poofah!  Bye-bye.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:53:00]  As we all get ready for WOW tomorrow, Anthony.  It's going to be a spectacular day.  Make sure you get the homemade WOW signs on your car.  Or get a WOW bumper sticker.  Oh, yeah.  Getting right into it, huh?  Sing it, Joe Pesci.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  I can't believe he actually did this.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's the bitches that'll get you. 
[00:53:30]  It's the bitches that'll get you.  That's what Jeff Gordon's saying.  Yeah, can I read this in?  Sure.  And then we'll get your opinion on things, because you went through something...  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Similar to this.  Yeah.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Racer drives hard bargain.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  The latest multi-million dollar Palm Beach divorce NASCAR champ, Jeff Gordon versus his beauty queen wife, Brooke, took an unusual turn this week.  It's the bitches that'll get you. 
[00:54:00]  I don't really like Jeff Gordon, I must say.  Starting to get into a little NASCAR because of my brother, Ant.  Is it because of all the times you were caught jacking it and you had to switch channels to NASCAR?  You kind of got to know the drivers now, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's like, oh, Sandy's coming, Clay.  There you go.  More NASCAR.  But, man, I got to tell you, Jeff Gordon's showing his balls without a doubt.  The stock car driver suddenly countersued on the grounds that since he risked his life for his $50 million fortune, she shouldn't get any of it, Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  My client should be exempt from splitting the estate because he continually risks his life to acquire it, said Gordon's lawyer, Donald Sasser.  It's not like he's a banker who goes to work from 9 to 5.  He takes his life in his hands every day.  Brooke's lawyer, Jeff Fisher, calls Gordon's claim both selfish.  Selfish, Anthony.  Selfish.  Selfish.  And arrogant.  You twat.  The element of risk is completely irrelevant.  He adds that Brooke was extremely active in all Jeff's professional activities.  Oh, they all say that.  Shut up, you bitch. 
[00:55:00]  Brooke is asking the court for temporary alimony and use of the couple's $9 million oceanfront mansion in Highland Beach, as well as temporary use of their luxury boats, a Porsche, a Mercedes, and their private jet, Anthony.  You know what?  I remember that, I remember you brought this up when you were going through your thing.  I actually made a stock car analogy when we were talking about divorce.  It was, what, two years ago? 
[00:55:30]  Almost three years ago?  And it was that, you know...  So was Jeff Gordon ripping you off, Ant?  Yes.  Ripping me off.  The gall, the nerve of this lawyer, all lawyers, I just, I would not shed one tear if every lawyer was wiped off the face of this earth with massive gunfire.  It would not, it would not sadden me in the least.  I think there's some lawyers out there that do some good, though, Ant. 
[00:56:00]  No, there aren't, not a one, they're all scum-sucking, scum.  Did I just say scum-sucking scum?  What about the lawyers that work for free, Connor?  They have an ulterior motive.  What is it called, pro bono?  Pro bono.  Pro boner.  They have ulterior motives, even them.  What about those guys?  Either that or they're trying to make up for some horrid thing they did in the past.  Well, the judge makes them do that, you have to do that.  It's not like they all volunteer their time, the judge, you have an extra amount of pro bono work you have to do.  So the judge, because you have to take care of the indigents. 
[00:56:30]  And they're looking for publicity, too, a lot of those people.  It all comes back in the waddle.  I don't think we should put everyone in a group.  Yes, we should.  Lawyers, one group, scum.  Unless we're talking about customer service people.  Yeah.  Lawyers.  Shut up.  Here's a guy, Jeff Gordon.  He's warming up over there, Ant.  Shut up.  NASCAR driver made a $50 million fortune.  How?  Now, not from his wife, Brooke. 
[00:57:00]  Not from her.  It's the guy, you like him or don't, I don't know.  I don't know much about Jeff Gordon.  He's kind of a fairy.  Well, whatever he is.  He wins a lot of races, though.  Well, you know something there.  There you go.  How does he win the races?  Is it because of Brooke?  I think he drives fast around a track, and his car is working when he crosses over the  line in front of everyone else, right?  That's pretty much how you win a race.  I think so.  You don't hit nothing. 
[00:57:30]  I think Gordon's wife, if I'm not mistaken, she was kind of one of those trophy slut girls.  Yep.  Oh, really?  Yeah, when they win the races, and then they get the hot piece of ass to give them the  trophy.  Or the Gatorade, or whatever.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  I think she was one of them, and then they kind of hit it off.  Hey, where's all the women's groups coming out and talking about women's individuality  and strength?  Oh, yeah.  Where's all that?  You don't mind when some pig is trying to suck $25 million out of a man because a man  did a man's thing?  You stupid, inconsistent whores. 
[00:58:00]  That really bugs me.  So this bitch's lawyer is saying he's being selfish.  He amassed a $50 million fortune where all she had to do for it was suck it and spread  them.  That's pretty much her job.  That's her gig.  Maybe take a punch once in a while.  Ah, whatever.  Whatever it takes, right?  But maybe, uh, you know, she was there for him.  No, you know something?  When he lost that big race, and he came home, and he was sad, and she was there for him. 
[00:58:30]  Who put a huge millions and millions of dollar value on being there?  Who's the scum lawyer who attached a price tag to being a roommate?  Well, she wants...  How the hell can these bitches...  Maybe?  ...get this kind of change for being there?  You know, he loses Daytona, he comes home, and, you know, he needed to cuddle.  What's it worth?  How much is that worth?  Put a dollar value on it.  I think she...  How much is being there worth?  I think she deserves, uh, half. 
[00:59:00]  $50 million?  You are out of your effing mind.  She should get maybe $2 or $3 million out of $50 million.  She should not.  She should get something.  But, uh, you don't deserve half.  And all of you feminists that want to talk about women's rights and how strong you all  are now because you wear dark blue suits to work, and you're still groveling for money  in court and begging.  Yeah.  You're still second-class citizens.  That's right.  That is absolutely right until, until, uh, something like this is, is taken care of  and the playing field is evened out. 
[00:59:30]  And I, it's not that I blame all women for a twat like this.  It's just that, well, where, where, where are the women screaming about it?  Yeah.  You know, well, she deserved it, didn't she, girlfriend?  Uh-huh.  The more the playing field gets leveled out in the corporate world and whatnot, you know,  women are doing much better in corporate world than they were years ago because, because  of laws that have been enacted that say you can't do this, that, or the other thing, and  they're doing very well.  But in divorce court, they have been the same as they've been for years and years, and there's 
[01:00:00]  no reason that this guy should have to hand over $25 million.  Half, half, half.  Yeah.  Half.  Half of his $50 million fortune.  And, and as this is going on, she gets the house, the jet, the cars, the boat, the,  what the hell is that all about?  This guy drove the car.  He drove the effing car.  You know what she should get to leave?  With all of her teeth intact.  Yeah.  That's what she should get.  Go out and find a career, you trophy hole. 
[01:00:30]  That's it.  Hey, time's up.  Your time's up, bitch.  That's it.  And again, I don't mean you leave somebody broke.  I got no problem.  If you're worth $50 million and she's with you for X amount of years and you get $2 or $3  million, that's fine.  You're set for life.  But if you have to continue to live the lifestyle you're used to, then get a career, stupid.  You know something?  I believe it should all depend on what the hell this bitch did for him.  All right.  Here comes Pat. 
[01:01:00]  Pat.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Pat.  You guys are crazy.  Why?  Why, Pat?  The reason that this divorce is going on is because he cheated on her and she caught  him twice.  Okay, Pat.  So he...  Hold on, hold on.  How does that...  Wait, wait.  So a guy cheats on his wife twice and all of a sudden she's deserved half?  No, she doesn't deserve half, but she does something because she ran his business.  Why?  How long were they married for?  Wait, why did he run his goddamn business?  That's boring.  He sets up all his appointments.  Wait, wait, wait.  He organizes all that stuff.  He's a secretary.  All right.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Secretaries don't make $25 million a year, Pat.  Second, why does a lady deserve half just because she caught her husband or boyfriend  cheating?  Hey, Pat.  Maybe she wasn't spreading her legs anymore.  Maybe she was giving him all the business and he finally decided to go get some on the  side.  Or you know something?  Maybe he's...  Hold on.  Maybe he's a scumbag who was effing around on his wife, but you know something?  It has nothing to do with the financial matter of this divorce case. 
[01:02:00]  It has nothing to do with it.  He could be the biggest scumbag in the world.  Yeah.  The fact is he drove that car around in circles enough times, faster than anyone else drove  their car around circles, to win a lot of money that she is absolutely not entitled to.  And she wouldn't even give him a threesome.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, right?  Come on.  At least throw that one in.  Yeah, rumor has it Jeff Gordon didn't even know what day he was married.  Hey, Pat.  What a scumbag.  I can't believe it. 
[01:02:30]  How long were they married?  Perfectly androgynous name.  How long were they married?  Like six years, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  She really earned $25 million.  Look, you've got to be honest.  Who cares if he cheated?  I mean, shut up, stupid.  It's not the right thing to do.  The guy...  $25 million for that.  He did the work.  There is nothing...  The lawyers like to make it seem like it's this huge partnership.  Just because you're married, you're business partners.  Yeah.  You have this 50-50 partnership, and that's bull. 
[01:03:00]  You get married for different reasons than being in a business partnership.  You get married because you're insane.  Yeah.  Because when you take care of all that stuff, and you can't do anything else, she's got  to get something for that.  Why can't she?  She's an adult who makes choices.  She can do whatever the hell she wants.  You fat-hipped idiot.  Well, she can do more than any of you other ladies out there because they have all the  help around.  She can actually go out and make a good living because she doesn't have to worry about the  stress of feeding a family and working hard to pay bills. 
[01:03:30]  She can do whatever the hell she wants.  She has more freedom than any of you girls.  She's an equal, isn't she?  I mean, what's the problem?  She's an adult.  She makes her decisions.  Why should she get half of that?  It's annoying.  Give her an hour.  She needs half of it.  This is what you got to be nuts over.  Hey, Pat, that's what we're arguing here.  Give her an hourly rate.  She thinks she deserves half when the guy was, you know, risking his life going around  the track.  I got a secretary's hourly rate.  She deserves something.  I got no problem with her getting $2 million out of $50 million.  That's a lot of money.  Six years? 
[01:04:00]  All right, that's a while.  No, she doesn't deserve half at all.  But also the fact that she goes around in public cheating on her.  She deserves half.  For him, he should cheat on her.  He drives around 200 miles an hour.  Pat, he deserves all the money he can get.  You know why?  He cheated on her because she was an awful lay.  Yeah, she was a model and she'd have to throw up before they did it.  God bless Jeff Gordon that he finally did something about it.  I'm fat.  He wanted some action.  He went out and got it.  I'm fat.  I'm fat.  It was probably guys that he was cheating with.  Most guys that cheat on their wives and their girlfriends do it because they're not happy 
[01:04:30]  with their spouse sexually.  Here's the problem.  They're not trying to purposely hurt you.  So many of you hot girls are awful at getting a guy ready for sex because women are not.  Here's the problem.  Women are not used to going out and trolling and making all the seduction.  They're so used to being hot and just getting hit on.  So what happens is when you want a woman that's really hot to try to turn you on,  they're so awful at it because they're used to just going, 
[01:05:00]  uh, uh, and smiling and having a guy with a rod jump on them.  So women are awful at turning you on sometimes because they're so used to just getting hit  on having to do nothing.  The rumor is he wasn't cheating with women.  I don't care if he was drinking out of mules.  He's worth 50 million.  He could slurp out of mine.  Just give me 500.  Well, see, you want something.  Why can't she get something?  We're not that gay.  We understand that she deserves something.  I would give her like 30 grand a year and a cute teddy bear once a year.  Yeah.  For Secretary's Day. 
[01:05:30]  For my teddy bear.  No, I don't agree.  I'm going to rock away bed.  Thank you, Pat.  Pat wasn't as awful as I thought she would be, though.  I thought Pat was really going to bug me, but Pat was all right.  Let's go to Lauren.  Change that horrible name.  And Lauren's not going to believe our answer, but we'll try anyway.  Go ahead, Lauren.  Hey.  Lauren.  Hello?  Speak.  Speak.  She might be gone, but basically she wants to say if the woman was really rich,  One would want the guy to get half.  Nope.  No.  Abso-effing-lutely not.  If the woman earned the money, she should leave with it. 
[01:06:00]  And when has that happened in recorded history?  What, three times?  Yeah, I know.  Leona Helmley?  Men get hosed in divorces.  Perish the thought of being a successful guy and getting in a divorce because the scum lawyers of all the wives out there,  the scum-sucking pig lawyers of the wives out there will do their best to F you to try to make it seem somehow like the wife has some kind of input on the man's career. 
[01:06:30]  And, yes, Opie, yes.  You're not sounding like a gentleman right now.  Why is that?  I'm not a gentleman?  You're not sounding like a gentleman.  It's the way these lawyers operate.  And it's something that's been ingrained in the court system that for some reason no one has been able to turn around.  There isn't enough ballsy lawyers and ballsy judges out there to make decisions that's going to change this situation. 
[01:07:00]  I hope this guy, Jeff Gordon, does something and the court slowly does change to where it's a lot more fair and the way it should be based on who's doing the goddamn work.  Remember when marriage was a cute little thing?  Yeah.  Now you're signing a contract.  You're signing a business deal.  A contract.  And you know what?  The prenups aren't even good anymore.  Trump signed one with his young hole.  Oh, yeah.  And she wants to go against it. 
[01:07:30]  You know what it is?  Right.  Then they all come up and dispute the contract that is the prenup.  There's an asterisk by everything you do.  You want equality.  Obviously, you should get it.  You're an equal citizen.  Of course.  It goes without saying.  Got to take the bad with it.  There's the asterisk.  Yeah, but I want to be a...  Stop looking for perpetual victim and second-class citizen status and then complaining when you're treated that way.  Stop it.  It's one or the other.  Right.  Going to be victimized your whole life.  I'm pro-woman.  Believe me.  They should make as much about it.  All of it.  Fine. 
[01:08:00]  They should let them play the NBA if they want.  And the WNBA.  No one wants to watch a bunch of holes running around throwing a little red, white, and blue ball.  It stinks.  You're good enough to match up with Shaq.  Why are there two chess champions?  There should be one.  Male or female doesn't matter.  Wait.  They have a female chess champion?  They do.  Yes.  It's ridiculous.  Tennis should be male against female because women can match.  The Venus, whatever the hell their names are.  They can be any men.  If there's a market for female sports, I could care less.  I don't have a problem with it.  But they should just match it up.  The best play the best. 
[01:08:30]  That's all that matters.  I don't care about, you know, except maybe basketball or football where it's physically  too different.  Paul the pilot.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, bro.  How you doing?  You can relate to this crap.  We're going to try and do a wow tomorrow.  Oh, cool.  Over New York about five o'clock.  Oh, nice.  Big skyrocketing wow.  Paul is a stunt pilot.  Yep.  He does those air shows and he's a sky rider.  He put a wow over New York a couple years back, two summers ago.  That was just unbelievable.  Well, a lot has changed.  I'm sure a plane flying erratically over New York won't raise any eyebrows now. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, God.  I didn't even think about that.  That's good.  Hey, Paul.  What is the criteria for flying over Manhattan these days?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you.  The first three times I called whoever I got a hold of over there at Newark Approach,  they were like, no way.  Not happening.  You're not going to do it.  Yeah.  So I kept calling back.  I finally got a guy that listens to you guys and he gave me authorization for tomorrow.  Oh.  Nice.  So tell me how much appeal you guys have. 
[01:09:30]  Definitely call us before it goes down so we can have a lot of people looking up.  Oh, definitely.  I'll probably call you from the plane because I worked that out last year.  Yeah, definitely.  Cool, man.  Call us from the plane.  All right.  Can you relate to this divorce thing, too?  Oh, yeah.  That's why I called was I got divorced about six years ago down in Florida and my wife tried  to get, you know, half the airplane, half of what the business was worth.  Oh.  And we came out with that I put my life on the line and she did absolutely nothing.  She didn't do the advertisement.  She didn't wash the airplane.  She didn't build the airplane.  She didn't fly it.  She didn't do nothing. 
[01:10:00]  Listen, they didn't give her a dime for the business, but she got 60 percent of my regular  job.  She got half the house.  She got all the furniture.  She got her car.  Oh, God.  Totally amazing.  But she wanted half of the airplane and that she didn't get.  Hey, Paul, after it was all over, did your wife's lawyer call you a gentleman?  Congratulations.  No, but I had a couple of names.  I'd like to call him.  All right.  I think this guy should be shot.  We're all secondhand citizens.  Good luck tomorrow, Paul.  Keep begging.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I'll call you from the plane.  All right.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  Bye-bye.  Heather is really pissed off at us.  Yes, Heather.  Of course.  What?  What's up, Heather?  I just don't know why.  I mean, you guys are bitching about this.  How old are you?  Nineteen.  Yes.  Mom trained you well.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Well, I mean, you guys, he deserves this.  He marries a stupid broad like that.  All you men, not all you men, but most of them, especially the rich ones, they marry  these broads.  They're all ass and all face and makeup, and they're bitches to them.  You know what?  Heather has a point.  In a way, stupid.  Why don't you guys marry a nice girl who's cool, funny, and she knows what's going on, 
[01:11:00]  she knows what's up, and you won't have this problem.  Because you can hang out with a comic who's cool and funny and not have to bang them.  That's why people have friends like us, because we're cool and we're funny, but we're all  awful looking.  I mean, you can have both.  You can have both.  Nobody wants to bang some fatty with a great sense of humor.  Hey, that's a great Iggy you do.  I don't care if a chick does impressions.  Can you do Carol Burnett?  Nobody likes funny girls.  And to tell you the truth, you could put a lot more on the scum lawyers than you can 
[01:11:30]  these bubble-headed bimbos that marry these guys.  No, I give the, they are the manipulative ones.  At least the lawyers, look, I'll say this to my aunt, the lawyers are dirtbags and they're  vultures, but they are what they are.  They weren't laying on their backs, opening their legs for some guy they really weren't  too crazy about.  Lawyers just do what lawyers do.  It's not personal.  They're dirtbags, and they should all fall into AIDS and swim and drink.  But they're not the ones laying on their backs, and lawyers are not complaining about  being second-class citizens. 
[01:12:00]  They're putting the asterisk and begging for victim status.  All right, Frank.  We've got to move on, but Frank, go ahead.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I've never really been a big Jeff Gordon fan.  I like NASCAR at all.  Yeah, but I heard he's really big down there.  Yeah, somewhat.  The only drive, what he should do, I should think what he should do with that business is  race her for the money.  Oh, yeah.  If she's done so much, why hasn't she race Jeff for the money?  The only thing she did while they were married was drive to the bank. 
[01:12:30]  That would be cool, yeah.  All right.  Set up a race, man.  I'll race you for it.  Cool.  All right, Frank.  Thanks a lot, guys.  What gear do I start in?  Does that close up today's Pitches Out of Kitchen, Anthony?  Yeah.  I mean, people are just calling like crazy.  Maybe we'll take more calls.  It's the Pitches Out of Kitchen.  It's the Pitches Out of Kitchen.  It's the Pitches Out of Kitchen.  Anthony, this just in from Dan from Hoboken.  I hear Dominic Barber estimated Jeff Gordon's net worth at $437 billion. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  Billion?  Woo!  It's a Pitches Out of Kitchen.  God bless Gene Simmons from Kiss.  It's the Pitches Out of Kitchen.  And his logic and reasoning as far as marriage is concerned.  He came on this program and spelt it out.  It's a Pitches Out of Kitchen.  And it was like Gandhi.  There have been transposed.  All the people called it that day in the craft team.  Yeah.  It's 100% right.  It's a Pitches Out of Kitchen.  Why should I give you half of what I made you?  That's right. 
[01:13:30]  He's a smart money-grubbing Jew.  Ben, he's smart.  Good for Gene Simmons.  Anthony, we want to talk about MTV2's controversial videos when we get back.  Oh, my God.  Porno on MTV.  Porno on MTV.  And we'll also talk about Maury.  We got the audio that we were supposed to play yesterday.  And, oh, yeah, there's this article in the latest issue of Stuff Magazine on fetishes.  Yes. 
[01:14:00]  Is Gary Coleman still on hold?  Why aren't we supposed to get to this last year sometime?  Well, we might try to get to that as well.  We got through the first one, Axolism, which is the fetish of having sex with an armpit.  Yeah.  But there's other ones.  There's a balloon fetish that's hilarious.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I actually found a website on that, too.  The balloon fetish?  Balloon popping or whatever it is.  Yeah, there's a whole balloon thing.  See?  No, no, no.  It's not that at all.  Hold on.  Now I've got to read it before break.  Because it has something to do with filling up the balloon and then having it rest on your 
[01:14:30]  yam bag, Anthony.  What?  Wait a minute.  You fill up a balloon.  You blow up a balloon?  And that turns people on.  Or fill it up with water.  No, you just fill it up.  It's that dry, firm feel on your yam bag?  Here it is.  Balloon fetish.  If a latex catsuit is sexy, why not a latex balloon?  Too big a stretch?  Well, Balloon Guy, operator of Big Boy's Balloons, his website, BustersWorld.com, enjoys overinflated 
[01:15:00]  balloons against their underside of his yam bag.  Like, yeah, okay.  And then they jokingly say, who doesn't?  Some fetish mongers, like Mr. Blow Up, actually don pumped up balloon wear, while others not  only consummate their relationships with balloons and inflatable pool toys, but also dream of  women's breasts inflating balloon style.  What the hell? 
[01:15:30]  Others express their love of balloons in kinder, gentler ways by making balloon animals at street  fairs.  Hey, we have one of those guys on.  Oh, great.  I've seen a balloon fetish site.  It's not a matter of the wrestling on the yam bag, it was just the guy, like women, really  good looking girls, sitting on balloons and holding them.  And it's a turn-on?  I don't get it.  I don't get that one.  Ah, a lot of fetishes just don't make sense.  Yeah, look at that.  It's a balloon fetish site. 
[01:16:00]  Well, we'll talk about it next, because we're running later.  Oh, God.  Check it out and give us your review of it next, okay, Ant?  Roy.  Right now, we'll go into the F.U. line, see what's going on there.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  I'd like to leave a big F.U. to the lady I DJed for last Wednesday.  F.U.  You dumb bitch.  I just walked in your effing door.  I have never DJed for you before.  You've never seen me DJ.  You've never heard me.  You've never known me.  When you come up to me and go, don't play any of your black music, you dumb bitch, and 
[01:16:30]  then you try to frickin' play tape me by going up to me and saying, hey, hey, I'm not a racist.  I know Bill from Chicago.  We're good friends.  You should need a Bill from Chicago like I know every goddamn black person in the whole  effing world, you dumb bitch.  Next message.  I want to send a huge F.U. out to myself for calling up the Opie and Anthony show and using  the word chocked full of.  What a f***ing retard.  I can't believe I called a national radio station in front of f***ing 18 cities and 
[01:17:00]  said, chocked full of.  What a f***ing regen.  F me.  Next message.  Hey, this is Doug from Staten Island and I'd like to leave a medium-sized F.U. for people  who mildly annoy me.  End of message.  So remember, guns don't kill people.  Dangerous minorities do.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It just doesn't get any worse than this.  The Hector Zebra finishing after Zeppelin played. 
[01:17:30]  Pretty much what you're going to be getting.  Shut up over there.  You've been good so far.  Shut up.  You're checking out the O&A show.  A couple phone numbers in New York, 877-692-1027, outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  Annoying laugh, Anthony, in the studio. 
[01:18:00]  He had to tell me that his divorce is going to be final very soon, Anthony.  How are they going to split up one limo?  And two vans.  Oh, and now two vans.  Look at you.  Yeah.  He's helping me out with my parents to get them home on, uh...  What, what, what, what?  The music was too loud.  What, Jimmy?  He's helping me out by getting my parents home Thursday night.  Back to New Jersey.  I don't want them taking a train at night.  See?  I have a good service.  Thanks for sharing.  But he's knocking...  Yeah, okay.  $50 off the price. 
[01:18:30]  Tess, how about that?  Joe uses me.  You don't use me.  All right.  I live 14 blocks away.  I don't know the limo.  You can't give him a van?  Uh...  I can give him whatever he wants.  Like a free van?  You're making a pay?  No, no, no.  I told him I would.  Oh, brother.  You're such a tool.  Hey, Ann, you checking out that, uh, that balloon fetish site?  Yeah.  It's, it's sick.  It's kind of weird.  Someone on the Instant Feedback is saying there's one guy with, uh, he has a really small one 
[01:19:00]  and he's, he's, uh, doing something with a balloon.  Is that on that website?  No, this is, this is all chicks.  Chicks.  Now he's leaving again?  Call him a dumbass.  There he goes.  We'll talk about it.  Nah.  What?  Oh, my God.  Here, here he goes.  Did you bring us something?  No, I didn't bring, no, I didn't bring you anything.  Nothing, nothing.  I brought you nothing.  I brought you nothing.  Hi.  No toys?  All right.  Will you just sit there and be quiet?  Yes.  Go ahead, Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  It seems to be just a sight of girls blowing up big balloons, like giant ones, and, um,  then touching them, and there's one group shot of, uh, one really big balloon and three  girls hugging the big balloon.  I so don't get this fetish.  Turn it around.  I gotta see this.  What is it?  Does it do anything for you? 
[01:20:00]  It looks silly.  It looks really silly.  If they were topless, it would do something for me.  Yeah, but that's just for the fact that they would be topless.  Yeah, exactly.  The balloon has nothing to do with it.  Exactly.  What's the name of this site?  Melly, I can't read it from here, Ed.  Mellyloon.com.  Dot com.  M-E-L-L-Y-L-O-O-N.  It's a balloon fetish, uh, website.  Yeah, and, and it's, it's, it's probably a true fetish site, because there isn't a bunch  of sex on it.  It's just girls blowing up balloons. 
[01:20:30]  And I've had that site, uh, I've known about that site for quite a while.  Now, why would you even, yeah, how would you know about that website there, Jimmy?  A friend of mine actually gave me the link.  That's not my fetish.  I'm really open about my fetishes.  That's not one of them.  I don't get it.  Well, you got the normal ones.  That's nice.  Yellow discipline.  What?  Diet Coke.  This is good.  Oh, here we go.  I'm not going to eat on the air.  I'm just, my Diet Coke is lukewarm.  No, really.  You're talking about your lunch order.  It always makes for good radio.  You're right.  I apologize.  That was kind of internal dialogue that I did externally. 
[01:21:00]  But I'm thinking people out there can relate.  Who hasn't had a warm soda, huh, folks?  Let's rally.  Well, this is the big weekend of the new video release.  This is on, uh, Melly Loon Events.  Today we introduce Liz's new video, Liz's Bursting Love 2.  Bursting, I guess, being with the whole balloon thing.  Bunch of extras on it.  Oof.  Just seems to be, I don't get this fetish. 
[01:21:30]  Now, is it a real fetish or is it one of these goof fetishes?  No, it's real.  No.  Because there's another fetish where people get turned on by having pies thrown in their  face.  This time around, they swear it's a turn-on to have pies thrown in their face.  It's probably humiliation.  It's got something to do with probably like that mother being dominating seas, kind of  like that dentist.  That is like an unsupportive dominating whore of a mother.  And that's probably why you get off on being humiliated.  Oofy, listen to this.  In this new video, Liz puts her talents to work on Tilly's, Unique's, Qualix's, Granger's, 
[01:22:00]  and more.  I guess those are types of balloons.  This time around, Liz talks directly to the viewer while she does everything from over-inflating  to stuffing her limbs into the balloons to an incredible bare-footed stomping spree.  Uh, yeah.  Check out free downloads to give a taste.  Oh.  In addition to Liz's new video being released on videotape and DVD, we have released Liz's 
[01:22:30]  first video, Bursting Love.  Bursting Love.  The first one.  You think they whacked their bags watching Hindenburg footage?  Oh, my God.  That must be like an orgy.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  That's the deep throat of balloon fetting.  Yes.  That's A.  That's A-sex.  Debbie does Hindenburg.  Oh.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Um, there's actually some guy at my work who, uh, who gets off on his kind of stuff. 
[01:23:00]  Do you punch his face whenever you see him?  He gets off on the balloon thing and he openly admits this to you?  He's one of them, how French do you say one of them faggots?  You faggot.  You faggot.  Inflated.  Why don't you pop a balloon, faggot?  Yeah, he was trying to actually recruit some dude that works in my, uh, my computer room  to get, to do it.  I was like, there is no way I was going to do it.  To do what?  I don't get this.  Yeah.  Is it blowing up the balloon? 
[01:23:30]  Is it popping it?  Is it making it into animals?  He said it's the, uh, he's actually, it's actually the popping that, that some kind of,  like, gets them off or something.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't think you blow up the balloon and make it into a shotgun and blow their heads  off with it.  Choke on it.  We've got to get an expert.  We had a fetish expert on the air, I don't know, a year and a half or so ago, and she  explained why this is, uh, you know, a turn-on to people.  I guess it's just like the excitement of it just, like, blowing up or something.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, boys.  MellieLoon.com is on, uh, FoundryMusic.com for your viewing pleasure. 
[01:24:00]  It's getting, uh, slammed.  And you're welcome, Mellie Loon, for that free plug.  Ah, whatever.  Maybe we can get someone from Mellie Loon on the show to try to explain this, uh, further  for us.  Yeah.  Also, the audio of, uh, uh, the guy that wants to remain nameless that stood up, uh,  in the middle of the graduate and told Kathleen Turner to put her goddamn clothes on.  Put your goddamn clothes on.  The audio's up on FoundryMusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  All right.  Well, I may be able to get you somebody on the next break. 
[01:24:30]  Seriously?  The board has, yes.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, I saw something on the internet.  You know, that I can understand, but, uh...  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  This has nothing.  Hold on, Scott.  They, uh, definitely dump out of the world.  Yeah, you know...  Why?  It could be inserting someone's mouth or ear or nose.  Yeah, we understand that, but there's certain things we're just...  But the thing there with a balloon, I mean...  This is probably the kid we used to rub the balloon on their head to stick it to the wall.  Oh, they didn't dump out?  All right.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, it was just a key word that was in a meeting the other day, depending on how it's  used.  I think that was a proper usage.  Let's go to...  I'd love you to explain.  Corey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  What do you call...  About six months ago on Playboy, and that show, Sex, Etc.  Yeah.  They had a whole thing about this balloon fetish.  Some lady, I don't know, out west, had, like, this whole balloon colony.  Oh, one of those.  Where people go and they...  Can I say hump?  Balloons.  You could say that. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, like, they'll have, like, these big life-size balloons, and they'll ride them.  Does the government monitor this and never allow them to vote again?  If that's something you engage in, I really believe that the National Guard should be  allowed to just put a bullet in you.  How strong are these balloons, though?  Are they, uh, those hoppity-hops?  Well, yeah.  They had, like, a bunch of...  Hippity-hop.  Hippity-hop.  I say hoppity-hop.  Hoppity-hop.  Yeah, well, what they did show on TV, they showed mostly women, you know, hot ones, bounce  up and down on these hoppity-hop top things, and they'll pop, and they fall on their  butts.  They'd be like, oh, oh, oh, these are so great. 
[01:26:00]  I'll bet you they're paid to be there.  The women are not getting off on this crap.  It's the stupid guys.  Some old, fat guy riding like the big, long one wearing a cowboy hat and black stock.  That's like the sex shows we always talk about on HBO.  And he would be up and down on it, and then he would go, oh, when it popped.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Did he do the old man moan?  Oh!  No, I was.  By the way, your old pal Jim Norton's fetish is not starting to look so weird now, is it? 
[01:26:30]  You can not understand it.  You're rule, Norton.  Thank you, mister.  I'm not into balloons or any of that nonsense.  It's got to be yellow and popcorn-y for me to be happy.  All right, Bob.  What's up?  Hello.  Hey, Bob.  Hi.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, this thing with this balloon stuff, man, I have a buddy that's into this, and he  tells me that it's really the anticipation of the thing popping that gets him closer to  his happy ending, you know?  So I just figured I'd pass it along.  Anticipation of the pop.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  Well, I can't figure it out, but he digs it.  I don't know.  So there you go.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  Be good, guys.  Mike's got to be lying here.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey.  Mike.  Hey, Jack A's.  All right.  He's gone.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, listen.  You think I was talking about fetishes.  I had this one gal out for a little while, and it started out, she just wanted me to  spank her.  Yeah.  I thought, okay, that's not bad.  That's not bad.  But while she was, how do you say, giving me oral pleasures? 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  She looked up at me and told me to spit on her.  Nice.  I didn't know what she thought.  She looked at me with those eyes, and she was just looking up, and she was garbling,  and she would say, go ahead now, spit on me.  Oh, dude, do you marry this girl?  Spit on her.  It's great.  Spit right in her face.  Spit right in her face.  She loved it.  Dude, a lot of, and you know, I know a guy that likes that.  He actually has girls spit in his face, or in his hand, and he'll lick it.  Oh, wow. 
[01:28:00]  Honest to God, it's about being degraded.  That's sexy, man.  That's really hot.  Wow, yeah.  Did you spit in her face, dude?  You know what I think's funny about this whole fetish discussion?  Like, you're in a relationship, right?  And you have this weird fetish.  Like, people have some of the normal, when I say normal fetishes, maybe a spanking fetish,  or you're into the foot fetish thing.  The foot fetish, or maybe a girl with big boobs, and you just want to wash your boobs, whatever.  Those are some of the fetishes I can kind of understand, in a way.  Infantilism.  What? 
[01:28:30]  That's the one where you dress up in a diaper, where she dresses you in a dighty?  Autos asphyxiation.  Okay, all right, all right, but that's what I'm getting at.  Like, the other ones, like, spanking.  You know, most normal people have heard of those fetishes.  Like, I've heard people are into them.  Well, let's say you got one of these weird fetishes, like our friend Chuck Farnham from  the...  Oh, yeah.  ...from out west there.  He was dating a girl.  We've had him on the air talking about this a couple times.  The girl's fetish was that she needed her boobs punched really hard.  He would punch her in her breasts.  Dude, this guy... 
[01:29:00]  This guy is the real deal.  I believe it.  So when he tells you a story, I mean, there's no doubt that he is telling the truth.  And he felt all weird, especially the first time.  I mean, the girl finally admitted, hey, this is my weird fetish.  I mean, how do you go about telling your significant other, this is what I'm really into, and I  need this to get off with you.  He said at first, he just kind of, you know, give her a little pop, and she kept going  harder, harder.  And he said he wound up and just launched her across the room with a hard punch to the 
[01:29:30]  breast, and she loved it.  And she got up and said, thank you.  She said, thank you.  And then the next morning, she would stand in front of the mirrors and admire her bruises  and get all excited.  I knew a girl.  This is true.  I used to see a girl, and she wanted me to spank her, and I would really spank her.  And I mean, so she was black and blue, and one of the turn-ons for her was to sit the  next day and then feel, like...  Feel the pain.  Yeah.  Or slap.  I like, like, very few girls want their faces slapped, but there's another girl I knew.  Oh, yeah, there were girls that like their faces smacked. 
[01:30:00]  This girl, we were hooking up, and she's like, pull my hair, so I pull her hair, because  I like to pull her hair, and she's like, slap me.  I'm like, all right.  Not that I mind doing that, but you got to be careful, man.  So I'm slapping her, and I'm slapping her, and she's like, harder, harder.  So I do, and I'm trying to make her perform treats.  Right.  You know, because I was like, oh, and she's like, no.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, do it.  And she's like, no.  So I'm like, do it, and I smack her.  And she freaks out.  Oh, no.  And she smacks me back.  Isn't that what she wanted?  No.  And she's like, fantasy over.  And I'm like, what's the matter?  What happened? 
[01:30:30]  Well, you don't know, though.  This is the point I'm making.  She's like, I'm sorry.  She's like, you were a little too good at that.  It felt real.  I'm like, sorry.  I'm like, oh, my God.  You're an actor.  And this is true.  And she's like, well, I don't like to be made to do that.  She likes to be slapped and, like, effed.  But she doesn't like to be made to give treats.  It's like, well, thanks for the distinction.  All of a sudden, Miss Vein attempted self-esteem.  How am I supposed to know that?  And the next thing you know, you didn't perform the fetish the right way.  She's going down to the precinct house.  Yeah, yeah.  She freaked out.  She apologized.  And now she's got marks on her face to prove that, you know, you did something. 
[01:31:00]  It was all in, it was in fantasy.  Dude, I had another one that I would date.  I mean, I tracked lunatics who liked me to bite her.  I wonder why.  She was British.  And she used to go, I want you to bite me.  And, of course, on her back and her neck, while I would, the one who had head I would  hold under the steering wheel and bite her back.  It's true.  Holy cow.  And I was always afraid.  What if she's going home and she's hit by a bus or she's killed?  I mean, sure, it's sexy and funny.  Oh, my God.  Then I got my teeth prints in her.  Well, she's found murdered somewhere. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, you are so screwed.  I was just biting her back earlier in the evening, but I didn't kill her.  Yeah, that's how you know Marv Albert really was telling the truth, because she loved it.  She was really smart and really funny and really dominant and boy, did she want her hair  pulled and big.  Yeah.  Oh, what a good girl.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's go to Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Tim, what do you want to add to this?  Hey.  Yeah.  Speak.  Go ahead, Tim.  All right, man.  I had one of those girls that had the boob punching fetish, too.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Like, she was all in it. 
[01:32:00]  After she'd be done giving me oral.  Yeah.  Like, she'd have me kick my feet around during, and then after, she'd just get up and have  me just start wailing on them.  Really?  It was sick.  But how did she go about telling you for the first time?  Like, she just, like, my feet were moving around during it the first time, and then she was  like...  You're what?  You're full?  Was she changing your diaper?  What do you mean your feet were moving?  Were they kicking slowly?  Yeah, I can't...  I threw up in the air.  Ah!  I got to control myself, you know?  I wasn't kicking too hard. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, hey, I was enjoying it.  Man.  Huh.  I don't get the weird fetishes, man.  That's weird.  Can't anybody just lay down on a towel and go, ah, no need to get up, I'm here.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You rock.  Bye.  I'm sorry.  I, um, I don't get it.  I don't get those wacky fetishes like that.  Well, then there's the, uh, you know, well, then there's the fat fetish, you know, they're  called chubby chasers. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, they're just afraid of being left.  That's all that is.  They're afraid of being abandoned, so they pick up a big manatee that won't go anywhere.  Is that it?  Guaranteed.  How could it not be that?  Some guys might be into the look of big fat things hanging on.  Yeah, yeah.  There's nothing more attractive than some monster who smells all the time.  I mean, you know, how can you not want that?  Yeah, of course.  That's what you want.  Not all BBWs stink.  No, you know what?  There's a lot of, there's a lot of really heavy women that are really hot and beautiful.  It's not a matter of that.  I hate the term BBW, because just because you're fat does not necessarily make you beautiful. 
[01:33:30]  Stop disillusioning yourself if political correctness is dope and diluting.  I'm sorry about disillusioning.  Here's a little site about a fetish, uh, a little fetish called, uh, the enema.  Seems to be a fetish.  Very common.  A little fetish.  I think they were checked into, uh, our own awesome Garrett's room up in Boston before,  uh, Garrett checked in.  He said there was remnants in the bathtub.  That's a common one, though, enema.  Enemas are addicting, because it stimulates you.  Well, they have, uh, something on this, so a website. 
[01:34:00]  I'm looking at an enema, uh, fetish website.  Your first enema.  And how to do it?  Yeah, it says, uh, it's embarrassing, isn't it?  You have the interest.  You may be a girl in your 20s, a man in your 60s, or anyone else in between.  The thing that makes you different from other people is that you have an interest in enemas.  It's not just the idea that a clean colon is the best way to a healthy body.  A good motto, by the way.  It's a desire to experience the colonic stimulation provided by a skillful, uh, enema giver. 
[01:34:30]  However, you may have lurked in the news groups for months, yet you're still afraid to post or to email any of the contributors.  Maybe you even went as far as to get an Anon number.  You may have even talked to your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife about enemas in a tentative way.  And been rebuffed.  Or maybe you don't have the ability to discuss the issue.  You're just too shy.  Yeah, how do you tell your chick that's what you're into? 
[01:35:00]  The first thing I want to tell you is you're not alone, whether you're male or female.  Many people have strong interest in enemas, both for cleansing and for erotic purposes.  You have personally corresponded with many folks, both male and female, who share, uh, what they call the kink.  Ovi, it's called the kink.  You have the kink?  I think we all have the kink.  People who, uh, are interested in giving, receiving.  My kink is different than, uh, Norton's kink. 
[01:35:30]  And your kink's different than, uh, my kink.  Right.  Well, this is called, I guess, uh, enemas are called the kink.  Oh.  Oh, I think it's just for enemas, Ovi.  The kink.  Someone better explain that to us.  Because it seems like the kink would be just, you know, you're just a, you got a little kink.  You know how you're supposed to put it, like, you're supposed to administer an enema.  I believe it's a slow water thing.  It goes in slowly.  I'd like to give one to someone, like, put it in, and then just jump on the bag.  Step on it.  And watch the water shoot it and blast out their eyes, mouth, and mouth.  It says there are probably hundreds of thousands of people who enjoy enemas, but for, uh, whom 
[01:36:00]  it's a dirty secret.  After all, it's unnatural, so they think.  I wish to say to all of you who fear to reveal your interest, there are others like you.  Plenty of people out there, Opie, who enjoy the enema.  And then there's, um, instruction on giving, receiving.  You need a comfortable, not too threatening position.  The A in the air position is probably not the best for your first. 
[01:36:30]  I suggest you lie on your side, bottom leg slightly bent, top leg drawn to your chest.  This exposes the area.  And then if someone shoots you off a starter pistol, you begin running.  Yet it doesn't seem quite so out there.  Yeah.  As with, uh, your area in the air and your face in the pillow.  And your dignity in a shoebox.  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  A bunch of zeros.  And then they say to, uh, well, slather the area up pretty good.  Let's just say that.  Don't use anything, um, you know, you gotta have it all prepared, that whole, uh, area.  Um, have your lava or partner use, uh, digits.  It says that.  Then, uh, right, they say right at the moment where you start, uh, administering, um, the area will relax and admit. 
[01:37:30]  Much easier.  It says, uh, as your partner begins to admit, relax.  A couple of deep breaths.  Relax as she invites in your family members.  Relax.  Relax.  It says, take a couple of deep breaths as the nozzle moves past the area of resistance. 
[01:38:00]  As she calls your mommy.  And who cares that your grandparents are looking down from heaven in shame?  For years they've been showing the other dead people, that's my grandson, and now you've got your face in a pillow in warm water being shot into you by some Swedish hooker.  Be proud of yourself.  Dude, I thought about that.  What?  You know what?  I'm doing this?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh.  If you've been in a...  Holy Jesus, wait a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  No.  When you're, um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I've thought about being in weird situations thinking dead relatives are looking down on me right now.  Me too. 
[01:38:30]  Me too.  Swear.  Me too.  Yeah.  I thought that was the only one.  I thought that was too ridiculous to say on the air.  Well, when you listen to that goddamn John Edward on that show where he says that people are looking in at you all the time and they just want, I want to let you know that that family member is looking down on you.  He's watching you.  He was there during that play that you mentioned.  And it's like, wait, if he was there for that, why wasn't he when I was A-slamming that whore or something?  You know, why wasn't he there?  You know, that's right. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  I'll actually.  They're always with you.  Oh, man.  Oh, great.  That's all I need.  Well, they're getting a hell of a show.  I leave the lights on and I hold and I'm like, it's big, isn't it?  And I look it up.  But that's so true.  You get that in your head.  I'm like, wait.  If they're there for the happy times, they must be there for these horrific times.  I'm here to verify that your father was there at the wedding.  He saw you in the gown.  He said, well, did he see later on in the night when the legs were akimbo?  When my wife strapped it on because we were drunk and. . . 
[01:39:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Was he watching in on that one?  Yeah, exactly.  Great.  Ghoulish relatives.  Are they there for that?  What?  Oh, oh.  They go away?  Let me give them this privacy.  Yeah.  No.  Nope.  Stop it.  They watch.  They sure do.  Opie, if you're using a Bardex or other larger nozzle during these enemas, your partner should  perform the application in several stages.  Can you use a beer tap?  First, the easy part. 
[01:40:00]  How about from the beer ball, Anthony?  Yeah, the beer ball tap, that pump thing.  They say, first you do the easy part, then let you rest for a few seconds.  Then slowly administer the bag part of the Bardex.  Wait a minute.  What is that?  Then let you rest again before inflating the bag part?  When the water is turned on, mentally open yourself to receive it. 
[01:40:30]  Mentally.  Imagine your area relaxed and accepting, ready to be filled.  I don't know why, but the main problem with enemas seems to be panic.  Of course.  It may be the size of the bag or the idea that this is going to hurt.  Of course.  It's like trying to run the New York City Marathon backwards.  Everyone's running this way and you're running toward them.  But if you just relax, how the hell do you relax in that situation? 
[01:41:00]  Accept the water as it flows.  Wait, what?  Yeah, exactly, Butters.  It won't cause nearly as much cramping and you'll probably feel okay from the very first moment.  Oh, it's all gooey.  Don't panic.  Do you know an adult colon can hold up to four quarts of water?  How about that?  How about a fresca?  So, it's just saying don't panic.  Isn't it healthy to get it done once in a while?  Like once every year and a half or whatever to have like a cleansing? 
[01:41:30]  I've never done it.  I just read an article about it.  Wait, you think the indignity of it will go away in a year and a half?  No, but I mean like medically, not to lack it back to.  Yeah.  There was an article in one of the health magazines, a little blurb, and said that it's a crock of ass.  What, it's not healthy?  That your body is keeping things clean on its own.  There might be some bacteria in there.  You don't need to go through that to think that you're going to be cleaner.  Where's the part, by the way, after you're done, where you hang yourself?  All right.  Really? 
[01:42:00]  I mean, I wouldn't mind.  You know, I might even allow a really hot girl.  She had like a yam-sized log.  She said, hey, this would look good on your chest.  I may laugh and agree.  She's got the consistency of toothpaste.  You're pretty much done with that in over there?  Yeah, yeah.  I was done with the...  Thank God.  See, you learned a little bit about an enema fetish, though.  Yeah, we're always teaching.  Don't panic.  Relax.  Accept.  Do it in stages.  Accept.  Don't panic.  Accept. 
[01:42:30]  Anthony?  Breathe deep, yes?  Frenchie went at it with Tom, once again, from New Orleans.  An enema session?  No.  What do you mean went at it?  Oh.  Relax, take it.  Tom from New Orleans.  All right.  I'm waiting for the bag part.  I'm relaxed.  I'm breathing deeply.  Come on, Frenchie.  He probably put it in his mouth, that idiot.  Do it in stages.  Let my wife do it.  I like the A in the A technique instead of putting my face in the pillow.  We call Tom in New Orleans because he's running a promotion that's a little different than ours. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  He likes to call his promotion Whip It Out Wednesday.  Whip It Out Wednesday.  And we're assuming that maybe there's a high rate of cancer down in New Orleans,  and that's why they're calling it Whip It Out instead of Whip Them Out or Whip Um Out Wednesday.  So we called to bitch about that, and then Frenchie got on the line, and they went at it again, Anthony.  And here is the result as we take a break.  All right.  Someone wants to say hi to Tom.  Uh, yes, uh, some guy named, uh, Frenchie. 
[01:43:30]  What are you guys doing?  How are you doing?  Y'all set me up.  You miss me?  You fat, disgusting piece of ass.  Huh?  With your bad breath.  You stink.  I can smell it all the way to Brooklyn, you fat F.  Oh, my God.  I can smell it, you toothless ass.  That's probably your upper lip.  That's because you eat too many of you F-ing shrimps over there, you dumb F. 
[01:44:00]  You drunk and mad.  Fag.  Your boyfriend's at the station, drop some beer on the board.  My boyfriend's your daddy, you French piece of crap.  Drop your pants and let me in.  You suck at the Fortin Island, you dumb F.  Drop your pants and let me in.  Yeah, I dropped my pants so I can stick it in your A, you fat F.  And you would love it, you stupid C-sucker.  And your wife too, she would take it in a dump, that whole bag. 
[01:44:30]  She likes it.  She likes to lick the dirty penny, that fat bitch.  With her fat cans.  Huh?  She loves it, that stupid whole bag.  You fat faggot, I hope you die.  In your effing sudden station, that suck ass.  Oh, yes.  You're pitying, right?  You're pitying your ass, you stupid faggot. 
[01:45:00]  You dumb nubes, you drunk ass.  All right.  Hey, Frenchie, wow.  I want you to die.  All right, I want to apologize to Tom.  Tom, um.  Never die, Tom.  Tom, I'm very sorry about Frenchie.  I'm sorry.  The guy's got no gas.  All right, Frenchie, hold on a second.  All right.  What, Tom?  Why do y'all set me up with this French homo?  He just calls in every time somebody calls this show that we're trying to talk to.  You're so full of crap.  I'm your nightmare, you effing. 
[01:45:30]  I'm your living nightmare.  It's not like we know who's on the phone there, Tom.  Tom, come on.  Just act like you speak a little German.  He'll run away real quick.  Believe me.  Hold on.  I'm going to speak some Italian, too, if you want.  Again.  Son of a bitch.  Italian?  All right, Frenchie, we don't want to burn you out.  No, no, no.  Don't want to burn him out.  One more thing to Tom.  You suck.  See all day.  And I hope you die of him.  Are you alright? 
[01:46:00]  Great.  Thank you.  Nice parting shot from Frenchie there.  All right, Tom.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Tom, that was awful.  All right.  I'm sorry.  You all right with that, Tom?  Yeah, I'm cool.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And W.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:46:30]  A couple phone lines open if you're in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  L.P.J. from Edison saying that my grandfather died about a month ago.  I couldn't whack my back for about a week and a half.  I couldn't get it out of my head that he was watching me.  That is so funny that came up on the show today because I really, really think that.  You know, you're getting your kink on.  Yeah.  And you're thinking, wait a minute. 
[01:47:00]  I got dead relatives that are watching me right now.  If they could watch it, all those great events through life.  And if John Edward on that frigging crossing over show can tell people how, you know,  I'm getting something here.  Something about a wedding recently.  A wedding.  Oh, yeah.  Here.  Over here, John.  Okay.  You wore something.  The thing that you need borrowed was borrowed from, and it was an old relative.  Oh, my God.  She just wants to tell you that she was at the wedding.  She saw you get married. 
[01:47:30]  And she kept her promise to be at your wedding.  Oh.  And then, well, if she could be at the wedding, couldn't she be at the honeymoon?  Couldn't she be seeing you, you know, there.  Now that spot won't hurt as much.  You know?  And did she say, every day?  Every day.  And if Grandpa liked to give you a little fondling while you were alive, why shouldn't he like to watch you when you're dead?  Lay in there with your Winnie the Pooh PJs. 
[01:48:00]  Who can resist?  Oh, God.  The little trap door in the back with the two buttons?  The little kh-kh-kh-kh of the feety, the little feety area on the linoleum.  Yeah, little feety, feety jommies.  As you shuffle back to your room, sore and confused, hoping it was all just a bad dream.  Oh, my God.  The stubble and the liquor and cigarette breath in your face?  Smells like whiskey and Lucky's, and it sure does hurt, doesn't it?  But there he is at your wedding after he's dead, looking down on you. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, wishing you're still wearing those little feety pajamas and red, this stubbly chin in your back.  You know way too much, man.  Oh, my God.  Someday we're going to get deep into your head.  Let's go to D.C. and say hi to Allison, the teacher.  What's up, Allison?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, pretty good, Allison.  Good.  Hey, I want to know.  I have a couple questions, but what's wrong?  Yes, Allison.  I would like to know, is this...  Oh, wait.  You're going to say the M word. 
[01:49:00]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You know what happens?  Allison?  Oops, oops.  Allison?  Yes.  Allison?  Yes.  Allison?  I can't do that, can I?  Just say...  No, Allison, you cannot use the M word for taking care of yourself.  Okay.  Are we clear with that, Allison?  I'm clear.  Just say taking care of yourself.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, should I start over?  You take care of yourself as you listen to us?  Of course.  It's called weak chinism.  Oh, my God.  And where do you do this? 
[01:49:30]  In my bed.  Really?  Yes.  And as you're listening?  As I'm listening.  And who gets you the hottest?  All three of you guys, but you know what?  Never me!  You sound sexy as hell.  I haven't seen pictures of you guys.  Oh, good.  Don't look.  I know, I know.  That's what I'm looking for.  It'll dry up like Saudi Arabia.  Okay, but my other question.  I tried to get tickets to Norton's show at the State Theater the other day.  Yes. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, it's sold out.  I have two shows.  Yeah.  I want to tell Norton that not only will I sit in front and laugh hysterically because  I'm just as dirty as he is.  Oh, dirty girl.  Can you sit in the front row with a skirt?  I sure can, and I can wow him all night long.  Well, don't wow me all night long.  Once is good.  All night long, I'll never get through my pathetic, awful jokes.  Well, not that it really matters, but just so I'll know you if I see you.  What do you look like?  Well, I need tickets, though. 
[01:50:30]  I don't know anything.  Oh, God.  Let's just get this over with so we can move on with the show.  Email Jim at tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  No, no, no.  It doesn't have to be about, oh, doing sexual things for tickets if you're attractive.  Oh, my God.  How dirty a girl are you?  I get pretty dirty.  Yeah?  I get pretty dirty.  Do you have a little fetish or something?  Um, I just like it really hard and really fast, and I like the rear entry a whole lot.  Wow.  Well, if you don't like it really good, then we can talk. 
[01:51:00]  She was the greatest piece of the last I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Hey!  Poof!  Poof!  Poof!  Wow.  You guys are fat.  And you like just being slammed, right?  I really do.  Oh!  I really do.  And what, like maybe your hair being grabbed?  Oh, of course.  Like a mane.  Yeah, from behind.  Every time you're getting some slamming.  Yeah, a nice reach around, too, is good. 
[01:51:30]  And the hair gets pulled a little back.  Yeah.  Ooh, Sonny's hot for her deal, isn't he?  Yeah.  Oh, no, here we go.  Up against the door during the wedding.  Yeah.  All right, Allison.  What can I do, boys?  What can I do to see Norton?  All right, listen.  Listen.  Listen, she was a crooked girl who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming  to her.  Listen.  Norton, I'm a hot chick.  You need me in there to look at.  All right, Allison, please.  Let me just take care of this for all the ladies that want to get...  Yeah, the ladies don't want to email. 
[01:52:00]  Get with Jim Norton.  They don't.  Tinkle Drinker at AOL.com.  No, they don't want to.  Don't be silly.  Now, if you want to get a ticket, I'll see if there's a station maybe has something to  give away.  I don't know.  A lot of times I don't control the comps in other cities because I have no family down there,  so I don't even ask for them.  All right.  What about a personal guest list of some sort?  Allison, hold on a line.  That's a possibility.  We'll get you Jim's cell phone number.  Is that good enough?  Yeah, it'd be perfect.  I won't get her cell phone number.  She might have some weird husband who wants to...  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not a psycho, single, completely single.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  She's a dirty girl.  Yeah, but you know what? 
[01:52:30]  It's not just about being a dirty girl, Jan.  There happens to be a lot of other things involved.  I am.  Yes.  I can think of none.  All right.  Hold on.  Speaking of dead people watching, Jen has something to add.  Yes, Jen?  Yeah, I just wanted to say a friend of mine had a private reading with John Edwards, and  she went because her daughter passed away, and she asked him about that.  She's like, if she could see me all the time, can she see me like when I'm in awkward positions?  And he said no.  He said they only see what they want to see.  They wouldn't want to see you in those positions, so they're not going to watch. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, what a crock of that.  John Edwards stinks.  He's an awful fraud.  He doesn't talk to dead people.  It's an old carny trick.  Hey, stop it.  He's a zilch.  He does talk to dead people.  He doesn't.  They had him on day line, and they tried to get him.  So he has decided that dead people don't look at you from heaven or wherever the hell they are  when you're doing the nasty.  He said if they wouldn't want to watch you in life, they're not going to watch you in death.  Like, if your mother's alive now, she's not going to want to watch her son having sex. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, speak for your own parents.  He's not going to watch you when she was dead.  Yeah, but you don't want to look at the car wreck, but you'll feel mistaken.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's a crock of crap because we're all nosy mother effers, and we're going to look.  He's a charlatan.  If I knew my mom was having sex and the door was ajar a little, of course I'm looking.  Do you fly there?  I don't think I'm going to be happy about what I'm going to see, but of course you've got to look.  And if you do see that, don't go saying something that's embarrassing me so I have to go explaining. 
[01:54:00]  And what do you do?  Do you fly there to watch the people have sex?  Do you fly to China to see people have sex in your dead little robe type thing where you can fly around?  And then does it take you a while to get back to see your parents having sex in New York when you're a ghost?  You know what happens?  You die and you're dead.  There ain't no people watching stuff.  Then why are you worried if someone's watching you when you're having sex?  Because I'm not sure.  Exactly.  All right, it's called the element of doubt. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, wait, hold on.  This gets even weirder.  Parker, thank God, though.  I don't mind my father, you know, looking and seeing me slamming.  You know, I don't care.  It's like, hey, that's my boy.  You know, imagine if you're a gay kid, though, and your dad dies and you've been in the closet.  And it's like, oh, you know, I'm just peeking on my boy having a little.  Oh, my God.  Oh, get that out of your mouth, son.  You know?  Oh, my God.  His A is up in the air and his face is in the pillow. 
[01:55:00]  Especially if you just killed a nom and he sees you with your face in the pillow and a yellow fella hanging out behind you.  Oh, my God.  He's bringing some war buddies from the platoon that he was killed with.  Why don't you say we're all looking on our boys having a little peace, you know?  We'll just look in.  And he goes to his buddy, you know, one of his buddies.  And there's his son banging away on his chick.  Look at my boy go.  He's packed just like his pop.  Right, like ghosts.  And then maybe you could go up to another guy in the platoon that was killed and go see his boy. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  And there he is slamming away on the girl.  Look, he's invited another girl into his wife's bed with him.  What the hell?  And he's watching him go at it.  And then it's time for a while.  The last guy.  Let's go see my boy.  And they go to the house.  They do that magic ghostly dead person flight over there, the three of them.  They open up the room and they see the boy underneath another man.  And here's the dead father looking on.  Yeah.  From the great beyond, Anthony. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Oh, God.  But to prove he's alive, just to prove that he's there, he has to slide a dirty penny under the door.  Oh, and here he can't contain himself.  He has to yell something out.  You can act like a man.  What the matter with you?  Ouch, I felt like I've been flapped.  Yeah, the son doesn't hear him because the dad's a ghost, Anthony.  Right.  He's yelling and screaming, trying to get his gay son's attention.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot? 
[01:56:30]  And that's all he hears.  But thank God, Whoopi is there because she could tell him what the father's saying.  Your dad's here and he says, your balls are shot.  Or he says, I hate your son.  And he says, ditto.  And then he looks over at his old war buddy who they've watched their sons having sex with women.  And he goes, what's that in my son's mouth?  And the buddy says, mule.  Oh, it's a mule.  And one of the French guys that died in Vietnam years ago was saying, suck it, you stupid faggot. 
[01:57:00]  Awful.  There's blow nut action allowed in the barracks.  Private pile.  More audio of the father looking on.  Yeah.  And listening.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Oh, that's not even right.  But he loves him because it's his son.  Oh, who's all doing?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the H, fellas. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Who the hell is he?  Mickey Spillane?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Oh, it was army buddies telling him that.  And the father is yelling from heaven.  But the son can't hear him, Anthony.  Yeah.  What is the father saying anyway?  Yeah.  Turn it off.  Yeah, but he can.  Turn it off.  He's got to learn from the guy in the subway how to move stuff around the room.  Turn it off?  You know, bash the KY jelly off of the dresser. 
[01:58:00]  And he's going to stay for this.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  Oh.  Turn it off.  What are you, gay?  That's horrible.  They're all pink on the inside.  Yes.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Oh, as the father looks on from heaven.  The father gets so close, so close to the son, trying to communicate that he's there. 
[01:58:30]  His friends mortified, so embarrassed.  And he says right into his son's ear.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Yeah, he's a little embarrassed.  What are you?  Gay?  Yeah.  He can only wish.  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay.  Yeah.  Oh, Billy.  Sweet, merciful crap. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  What about that, John Edwards?  What about that?  Yeah.  Could happen.  If you think about it, really.  Really.  Parker, what's going on?  Your kid's got hard, crispy apple breasts.  Hold on.  I've got to go to Adam.  He's going, stop.  I'm gay, and my dad fought in Vietnam.  Oh, no.  Adam.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Adam.  And your dad's dead?  Yeah, it's my dad died two years ago, and he was a veteran in Vietnam.  And now, and he never knew that, well, and he never knew that I'd like to suck the sea. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, no.  He knows now, son.  I have a date with my boyfriend tonight, and I'm thinking, just as I'm about to suck the  sea, I'm going to have him looking down with his war buddies and being like, hey, faggot.  Oh, that's horrible.  You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to suck the sea.  Guys, you're ruining it for me.  All right, bye.  Are you an assassin?  I'm a faggot.  You neither. 
[02:00:00]  Silly little grocery clerk.  Gay.  I can't believe my son is gay.  I'm going there today.  Oh, boy.  A mule slithering on the edge of a straight razor.  No!  Well, here they are.  Air faggot.  Ace of diamonds. 
[02:00:30]  Two of spades.  I love the smell of man-ass in the morning.  Smells like homosexuals.  If I say it's safe to suck that sea, it's safe to suck that sea.  Charlie, don't drink mule juice.  Every girl is going, what movie is that?  What movie is that?  And every guy is applauding.  Stop watching love stories, you holes.  Get with Apocalypse Now.  Oh, God. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  A man holding his own guts and could suck my sea any time he wants.  Give him that sea.  Never take the sea out of the effing pan.  Never take the sea out of the effing pan.  Dear Eva, today I sucked an effing sea.  Where's your sea sucker? 
[02:01:30]  I thought you were our sea sucker.  In the U.  Look at all those beautiful mules in the water.  They were turning gray, man.  Hey, what's going on here?  Oh, that makes me happy.  I love Apocalypse.  How can you?  I was watching it last night, the redo on my television.  Redo.  Isn't it great?  Saigon.  It's amazing.  Saigon.  Wow, is that a great job. 
[02:02:00]  Still in Saigon.  Suck the sea.  Suck the sea with extreme prejudice.  At the same time, we may suck both ways.  If you suck this sea, you'll never have to move your bravery in any other way.  Have you ever sucked on the general or myself?  He wanted to suck a sea?  He was 36 years old. 
[02:02:30]  Sell the house, sell the kids, suck a sea.  What are they going to say?  He had a big sea.  They teach young men to drop fire on people, but they won't allow them to suck a sea because  it's obscene. 
[02:03:00]  Slytherin.  That's great.  Very good.  God, you've got to think that might be happening.  They might be looking down on you.  Boy, try having some sex tonight.  Thinking about that one.  Thinking about who's looking in from above.  I remember that the first person that died that I really knew was my grandfather on my  mom's side.  And after that, it was like, oh, yeah, that was in my head. 
[02:03:30]  Like, well, you're never there before.  You didn't think about it.  And I was like, oh, what if grandpa's, you know, taking some time out from the Met game  to watch me doing this?  Red rocket, red rocket.  Yeah.  You know, especially at that age, you're tugging it like crazy.  Just imagine this.  Tonight, you're slamming.  No, this won't be as bad because it won't be a relative.  Everyone just picture Robert Urich is looking down on you. 
[02:04:00]  Oh.  Robert Urich is watching you.  I thought he beat the Dancy.  I did.  He didn't go to Dr. Kennedy, Tony.  I told him, Robert, you've got to go to Dr. Kennedy for the cancer.  For the big casino.  Yeah, he had it, like, beat or something.  I thought he beat it.  Zantana.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony.  It was a Vegas show.  It was a Vegas show he was in.  Yeah, Vegas, it was called.  Vegas.  It was a Vegas show.  And then he had the other one up in Boston.  Who was he in that? 
[02:04:30]  Spencer for Hire.  Spencer for Hire.  Spencer.  All the best shows.  Spencer.  I'm the only black man in Boston, Spencer.  That was a great show.  I liked the Robert Urich shows.  Hey, Ann, before we take a break, a lot of people want to hear the Kathleen Turner thing.  One last time.  We're not going to spend a half hour on it like we did yesterday.  Twice.  The audio is up on foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  But pretty much, you want to just quickly explain?  Well, Steve C. from our own show went to go see The Graduate with Kathleen Turner. 
[02:05:00]  She's got a nude seat and about 15 minutes into the play, she drops a towel.  Complete full frontal nudity.  Steve said it was horrific.  And we thought at that point we should send somebody to the show to yell out, Kathleen,  put your goddamn clothes on.  Right.  Got a couple of tickets from some listeners.  Sent a few people, like three people into the audience with recording devices to record  the man standing up and yelling, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  Here is that tape.  Yeah, here's the tape recorder from way back. 
[02:05:30]  We're going to play all three really fast.  It's less than a minute here.  That's the...  What?  He's so nailed you, O.P.  He gets you every time.  All right, here's the first recording from way back.  Listen to the guy try to get the recorder out of his pocket.  Hello.  This is rough.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I want to say something.  Hello.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:06:00]  I want you to know that I'm a lady.  Oh, my God.  The best is the lady going.  If that isn't good enough, then we had someone a little closer to the stage with another recording  device, Anthony.  And this is how this one went down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  And finally, a recording from the guy as he stood up with the recorder right in his shirt 
[02:06:30]  pocket, Anthony.  No more than 20 to 25 feet away from a naked Kathleen Turner as he stood up and said this.  Okay.  It's on the bed.  Oh, God.  This is wrong.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:07:00]  I want you to know that I'm a lady.  Oh, my God.  Rumble through the room.  That took balls, my friends.  There you have it.  Very, very good.  The sea-sucking piled up so vast in Vietnam, you needed wings to sail up.  All right.  We'll continue.  I don't know if this makes sense to anyone today, but we're having a good time here in  New York. 
[02:07:30]  You're killing me with this, man.  I love it.  Once again, let's go to the FU line.  We'll be back.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  I'm going to send a big f*** you out to the Boston Red Sox and all their loser fans.  It's only f***ing April.  Don't get so excited about beating the Yankees.  Don't celebrate because talk to me in October because you'll be exactly where you were last  year.  Behind us by 13 games because you f***ing suck.  Boston sucks.  I hate you.  F*** you. 
[02:08:00]  Next message.  Yeah, this is Pits in order to give a big f*** you out to Dave Matthews.  You canceled a concert last night, and I had nothing to do.  I was waiting four months for this f***ing show, and now I don't know when you're playing  again.  If you play tonight, I'm really going to be f***ing pissed at you.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big f*** you today.  Sea-sucking bag of meat waitress that couldn't serve me my lunch today.  It took her 35 minutes to make me a chicken sandwich.  So she finally comes back with it, and it's cold because it's been sitting there for 20 
[02:08:30]  minutes, and she wonders why I'm not going to pay for it, and I don't want it.  Oh, F*** you, you big dumb twat.  Next message.  This is a big F*** you to all you f***ing drivers out there on the Schuylkill Expressway  in Philadelphia.  It's f***ing rain.  It's only goddamn water.  It's not going to make you slip and slide, so drive, you a*****.  End of message.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this. 
[02:09:00]  I don't want them enjoying it like it's back on me.  Sometimes you want to hear...  What?  What?  The Opian Anthony Show.  What are you saying?  The Opian Anthony Show.  WNEW.  This is the RM6, the World Wrestling Federation Champion.  Pleasure for me, to the Anthony, and Opian, they're bringing me to the WNEW, is one of the number 
[02:09:30]  one station in the Manhattan and New York.  And pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, and hello to all people to the wrestling, to  the WNEW station.  Number one radio station in New York.  And pleasure to have you here.  And we're back with the Opian Anthony Show.  Goddamn, I love that Iron Sheik.  We've got seven versions of that, Ant. 
[02:10:00]  Pleasure for me.  We've got short ones, long ones, and everything in between.  The Opian Anthony Opian.  What a guy.  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me, to the Anthony, and Opian, bring me here to New York.  So I say hello to all my wrestling fans, and everybody know, I'm the real Middle Eastern 
[02:10:30]  men, come to the greatest wrestling country, and most famous city in the world, Manhattan,  Madison Square Garden.  I've come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American, and also my Iranian  friend.  Oh my God. 
[02:11:00]  Pleasure for me, to I come back here again, one more time, to I talk today.  Why are all the cabbies leaving their cars?  Just sent them wild.  All right, Ed.  We have a choice to make here.  Yeah.  Maury Povich Audio, or discussion on controversial videos that MTV was running.  I love to talk about the videos, but I want to hear Maury. 
[02:11:30]  We can do both.  We don't beat bits into the ground.  We can actually take on two bits at one time now, Anthony.  There's room for everything.  The old days, we'd still be talking about that stupid balloon fetish.  Right.  We'd still be doing apocalypse now things.  Right.  Like we're going to pick up that big C and put it down wherever you like, young captain.  Young captain.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Screw Maury, man.  For the first time in like 10 years, MTV had something decent on.  Man.  It was on MTV2. 
[02:12:00]  It was on MTV2, but I heard it originally aired on MTV.  It was horrible on MTV.  On MTV, it wasn't Andrew WK hosting it, and it was edited to hell.  Everything was cut out that they were complaining about being cut out.  All right.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  The one that I saw last night, it was Andrew WK was hosting it, and it was all of the videos  that have ever been the controversial, cut up, or just banned videos from MTV.  Yeah, most of them were really bland, like Me So Horny and Big Butt Song, whatever, but 
[02:12:30]  Smack My Bitch Up, the prodigy song, was the best video I've ever seen.  Chris, there was a full-on slot shot from the girl.  Remember the end of that video on the bed when they're going at it?  You saw the heels came way apart, and you saw everything.  I remember when they couldn't show that on Showtime or Cinemax, and they're doing it  on MTV now.  Yeah, and then MTV2. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, I was talking about this in the back room.  I'm like, no way do they show that on the regular MTV.  I saw more on M2, and this is no joke or anything.  I saw more on M2 last night than I've seen on any spanktribution, like, crap porn you get  in a hotel.  It's completely true.  I couldn't believe it.  Somebody told me that MTV2 showed stuff on it.  I was like, no, there's no way.  It's a commercial station.  It's going to be the same crap that they show on regular MTV.  Did they show Live Wire by Motley Crue?  That was a video.  One of the first videos, I remember.  No, no.  They did about two hours, which was like a top 20 countdown. 
[02:13:30]  There was lots of, like, oops, I did it again, that kind of stuff.  Then they did, like, another hour or so of extra stuff that they didn't show, which  was great.  They showed, like, uh...  They showed some of the Nine Inch Nails videos?  Nine Inch Nails Closer was great.  It was great.  Yeah, that was...  Oh, my God.  ...hacked the pieces, too.  Because that was cut out.  If you remember the videos you saw on MTV when they played that, there was a scene missing.  Maybe you'd see, like, it was a very dark, disturbing Nine Inch Nails video.  And you'd see scene missing.  They'd put a little sign up.  And you'd wonder what the hell was that all about? 
[02:14:00]  It was, uh, full frontal nudity.  Some chick all completely shaved.  The crucified monkey.  The crucified monkey, which is hysterical.  They got a little Reese's monkey on a cross.  And it's, like, struggling and...  Why'd they take that off?  Yeah, I guess people would feel it was offensive.  Why?  Catholics.  They should show it rolling at television.  What a callback.  God damn you.  They showed that they weren't black.  That wasn't what it meant. 
[02:14:30]  I didn't say anything about being black.  You said they were monkeys.  Oh, my God.  Now it's bad.  I didn't mention race at all.  I don't even...  I don't know who the movies were.  I would hope he was getting out there.  But that wasn't the point I was making when I said two gorillas rolled my new team.  And neither was I.  I just tied in monkey and gorillas.  Wow, I'm going to step out of this one.  I just want to make sure that people understand that the two movers were not black in my situation.  I'll be back.  I never said they were and didn't guess that they were.  Why am I just saying myself? 
[02:15:00]  Look, I don't care if they were or not.  They stink.  They showed naked?  I called them gorillas because they didn't have any finesse to them.  Oh, my God, I'm trying.  I understand.  And I mentioned the monkey thing because the guy was crucified and they were gorillas.  It all ties in.  They're all citizens.  Waddle doodle.  Why didn't the grease man just come in and wrap the whole thing up?  They ought to drag delivery men by trucks.  Waddle doodle.  What?  I'm not of a job?  They ought to put monkeys on crosses.  Waddle doodle.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  Bone dry, snarlings.  It's the grease man show.  I'm sorry. 
[02:15:30]  Go ahead, Anthony.  Waddle doodle.  So you were saying.  We saw Bajork naked.  Bajork.  They showed her topless and all pierced and everything.  You know what?  All right, I'll have an open mind.  Is she hot naked?  No.  No, no.  But she was naked nonetheless, which is, you know, that's a plus.  You kind of, you know, you're like, wow, curiosity back naked.  Bajork.  How about the great uncle video with the homeless guy walking down the tunnel just getting bounced off the floor?  That was great.  And I was saying, I go, you know, that's a video that's very, it's artistically done. 
[02:16:00]  It's clever.  It's very cool to watch.  But MTV didn't air it because they were afraid of imitation or it was too violent.  It was a guy walking in a tunnel like a homeless guy with an old snorkel jacket on just mumbling in like German to himself in a tunnel that you would see, you know, any of the big tunnels around a city.  And he's walking in the middle of one of the lanes.  And every so often they just show him get slammed by a car. 
[02:16:30]  And it was done digitally, but very well.  And it looked like this guy was getting hit by cars every two seconds.  And he'd lay on the ground and slowly get up, brush himself off and start like walking again.  And then, bam, who's going to reenact that?  But there's no homeless people walking through tunnels.  They get so scared that people are going to, you know, people are going to imitate this.  And then they'll sue and take the fire out of the Beavis and Butthead cartoons and cancel jackass.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Caving into every bit of it. 
[02:17:00]  It was ridiculous.  They showed the uncut version of Madonna's video.  Which one was that?  That was just fun.  I love it.  I was kind of bland.  Yeah.  All the hype it had gotten about how they had to cut it.  It was really nothing.  They showed some boobage behind some suspenders.  I heard they showed the Pearl Jam Jeremy video.  Yeah, where he puts the gun in his mouth and actually, you know.  They cut that originally?  Yes.  Yeah.  They had to cut that.  The kids might, you know, the kids might watch it.  And the George Michael video.  Oh, please.  Oh, my God.  What was the problem there? 
[02:17:30]  It was, I want your sex.  Was that the one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was more that they cut out, thank God, of naked George Michael.  He's like sitting there naked and he's got some naked chick with him.  But, you know, it's naked George Michael.  Yeah, I know.  That was a...  He's singing into a mule.  I think it was...  I think they edited the part out because of unbelievability.  It's like, you could definitely not hear...  One other thing about the uncle thing before I have to go.  Yeah.  The guy who directed that, his name is Jonathan Glazer.  He's the one who directed Sexy Beast that Ben Kingsley was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's a great movie.  And every other, like, third word out of Ben Kingsley's mouth in that movie is the C word.  I highly recommend it.  You'll just laugh for the first 40 minutes of that movie.  Cool.  I'm running it tonight.  Thanks, Chris.  Take it easy, guys.  I'd be pissed.  I was even saying, if I was the director of that video and you came up with a great concept for that  and pulled it off where it looked really good, and then you got some boardroom full of jackasses  saying you're not going to get on the show that has the most visibility because they 
[02:18:30]  find it offensive in some way, shape, or form.  Are you surprised?  Not at all.  I'd be pissed, though.  We've been trying to put out our next CD, Cringe, for almost three years now.  Yeah.  Maybe four.  Mm-hmm.  But the version they want us to put out, we...  I know.  We don't want to put it out.  That's how it is.  It's boardroom people.  We're fighting with the lawyers.  Who's that?  Lawyer?  What the...  We just...  Dude, it's a whole big thing.  We have a double CD that'll just set the world on fire.  A lot of stuff you've never heard on the radio. 
[02:19:00]  And we're fighting.  We want it out.  It's called Cringe.  It's ready to go.  Cringe.  We can start selling it tomorrow.  I just want to know, dude.  And it'll make a lot of money.  That's how you have to...  That's how you have to talk to these people.  You got to tell the lawyers in the company, look, look, here's the bottom dollar.  This is how much money you're going to make if you put out the Opie and Anthony  crit CD as the boys want to put it out.  They're just a bunch of guys in ties who desperately want to somehow contribute or be associated  with entertainment.  That's all it is.  Someday you'll hear the story. 
[02:19:30]  We'll have to write about it or something because the discussions we have over the CD,  it's ridiculous.  By the way, did you see you set the world on fire?  I know.  I know.  I was hoping you'd let me slide on that one.  If I had a hammer, I would throw it at you for that.  We want to go in.  Elvin on line four.  Holy Jesus.  I forgot about this.  Elvin.  Yeah.  The Metallica video turning the page.  The number two video.  Have you guys seen that?  Yeah.  Last night they played it in its entirety. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  It was Ginger Lynn.  Yeah.  The porn star is in that video.  You might have seen the version that they put on MTV.  The version we saw last night on M2, the uncut, it was controversial videos that they  were showing, Ginger Lynn, completely naked, bending over at the strip club.  You saw full frontal Bush nudity in depth.  I'm talking not Playboy type nudity.  I'm talking hustler type nudity.  Dude, they showed the fish eye. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Why would they make it?  And then they got some guy at the end.  He's banging the crap out of her in a hotel while her nine or ten year old daughter is  watching from another room.  And the guy is beating the crap out of her and banging her, like grabbing her.  And you see her cans going back and forth.  And this is on MTV.  M2.  Now, hey, I'm not complaining about that.  I'm not either.  Put this on CBS.  But how did MTV, you know, decide, yeah, what the hell, we'll put this on M2?  No idea what decision was made. 
[02:21:00]  I am like, but I was watching thinking, you know something?  And is that allowed on, like, M2?  It has to be.  Cable, you're allowed to put anything you want on cable.  It's not broadcast television.  You can put it on cable.  The trouble is they're worried about advertisers and things like that.  It has nothing to do with an FCC law.  And parental groups in basements.  So they can put that on.  And they did, man, last night.  I'm watching going, oh, when I saw Ginger Lynn, she's doing a dance at a strip club.  And it's everything. 
[02:21:30]  Well, they're concerned that, you know, the real good companies like Pepsi-Cola, which rots your effing stomach, might get upset that they're showing something.  That garbage you're selling.  I hate.  I can't say that.  No, I hate.  The advertisers.  All right.  You just, you soulless, vulture, rip-off scumbags.  They kind of.  Yeah, they keep your job going.  They kind of keep your job going.  No, they don't.  Yes.  No, they don't.  Because if it wasn't for TV or radio or magazines or other entertainment venues, do you think people would turn on TV or whatever just to look at ads? 
[02:22:00]  No.  Well, Jim, except for our sponsors.  We love our sponsors.  Your sponsors, I'm not just saying this, have some ads.  They're talking about stuff that makes your, this tastes better.  And, you know, at least like a crisp hard apple.  And they're advertising on an edgy show.  Here comes the patriotic music again.  Adam, what's up?  You're right.  I apologize.  Hey, man.  Adam?  Yeah, am I on?  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Did you see the one video with the girl?  She was in that black car and at the end she hit another car and she flipped over?  Yeah, the cardigan video.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  But they, I can't believe they banned some of these videos just for violent content like a car wreck.  And, you know, why would they edit that out?  When are they airing this again?  I got to check this out now.  Jay, what's up?  Jay, really?  Jay, Jay.  Jay, speak.  Speak.  All right.  He went away. 
[02:23:00]  He left us.  All right.  Someone find out when that's on again.  Yeah.  So we'll pass it along to our listeners.  The M2 version.  Hey, you know what?  Why don't we, instead of taking a break, let's get into the Maury Povich thing.  Maury.  Do we have all the audio?  Yeah.  We were watching Maury yesterday.  Yeah.  We were in the office dying.  This, this Maury is a genius.  I admire the man so much.  He has figured out a way to get parents to bring their freak, deformed, retarded children to him voluntarily. 
[02:23:30]  Allow him to put them on national television as nothing more than freaks.  As nothing more than freaks.  To exploit these children for the price of a day at an amusement park or a, I don't know.  Or to meet a rock star.  To meet a rock star. 
[02:24:00]  Pop star.  Something, something.  And these parents voluntarily take their freakish, disturbing-to-look-at little children on this show under the guise that Maury cares.  You know what you should do if your kid is like, hold on, hold on.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That Maury cares!  Maury doesn't care!  You can tell by the way they use the kids.  They're not just parading them on anymore.  This is great. 
[02:24:30]  They are not just bringing them out on stage and letting you look at them and gawk at the freakish children.  Because we've gawked so much, now we need something else.  Now we need something else.  So Maury, in his infinite wisdom, Lord God Jesus Maury, has figured out how to make it even more entertaining.  I think he's like a drug dealer.  He gives you a taste.  He gives a little taste.  He gets you hooked, and then what do you need?  You need a little more, right?  So now...  Something a little stronger.  He works them into little vignettes.  Little skits.  And little skits on the show that had us, I swear, I had to stand up and run around the room because I was laughing so hard. 
[02:25:00]  I thought I was going to wet myself.  And the audience is applauding, and they just don't see through this.  Because Maury is too...  They had little...  They had kids on yesterday.  They had black pejoria kids.  They were little...  Well, one of them was a white kid.  I think they were multiracial.  A couple of Hispanics, some black ones.  And they were a different type of pejoria kid.  They were midget pejoria kids. 
[02:25:30]  They all had the same face, but they were a lot smaller than regular pejoria kids.  They were, I swear to you...  They were two feet high.  The size of little dolls.  They were little dolls.  And their faces looked like those wacky, muppet-like creatures.  Like the penguin.  What are those wacky, muppet-like creatures that are in the faraway, distant castle land?  Not from Fraggle Rock.  Yeah, I think it is.  Something like Fraggle Rock.  Down on Fraggle Rock. 
[02:26:00]  They looked like that.  Their faces.  They had, like, beaks.  They had beaks.  And their huge eyes were, like, in deep sockets.  And they had their wacky mouth.  Like, they were freakish-looking things.  But yet, only about a foot and a half to two feet tall.  So Maury decides...  So Maury, instead of just parading him out, does this little sketch.  He's sitting in his office.  There's a knock on the door.  It's his assistant.  Yes!  Maury, could you take care of the kids for a while? 
[02:26:30]  We all gotta go.  Oh, I'm a little busy, but...  Okay, bring him in.  All of a sudden, in a scene that you could put in any horror movie,  the door opens up, Maury stands up,  and five or six of these little freak children,  these little two-foot-tall, freakish-looking monsters,  come running at him.  Hold on, hold on.  All right, go.  I was watching the tape back again,  because I had a bit of audio on,  and I'm watching it, and one could not even run. 
[02:27:00]  No!  One, as he goes to play hide-and-seek,  one can't get out of the camera view faster enough  while he's counting to ten.  It's sad.  They had legs that were...  They looked like...  Probably about as thick as a magic marker.  That was about it.  And they waddled, because their bones were all left up,  so they looked like little penguins  waddling down the hall,  but as fast as they could.  Like, faster than you could run away from  in any horror movie.  And if you run away and turn the corner, 
[02:27:30]  there'll be more around that corner.  It was freakish.  I thought those two twins from The Shining were scary.  They should have been these little fidget kids.  Come play with us, Danny.  Horrifying.  So Maury goes,  All right, let's play hide-and-seek.  That's what a kid with pejoria wants to play,  hide-and-seek.  Yeah, let me hide for, like...  By the time the game's over,  he's just aged 25 years.  Thanks, Maury.  Olly olly oxen free!  Come out, come out, wherever you are.  They died of old age  while you were counting to 100, Maury. 
[02:28:00]  Here's some.  You want to throw them a bone?  Why don't you get them, you know, Hummers?  Get the little freaks, Hummers.  They don't have much time.  They're in the body of a 70-year-old.  You might as well, you know,  treat them to a Hummer.  So he's playing hide-and-seek with them.  But here's what I'm thinking the meeting  must have sounded like.  So we're going to have little  one-and-a-half-foot-tall freak kids on.  What can we do with them?  I'd like to see us figure out a way  to see what kind of 
[02:28:30]  small places we can shove them in.  All right, Maury.  Let's, um...  We'll play hide-and-seek.  Great. Do it.  So we'll make believe  they got into these spaces on their own.  Yeah, like they hid themselves.  Yeah, like they could climb up  into, like, a drawer  that's five, six feet off the ground.  So Maury counts,  and now he's got to seek out  the little freak kids.  This is really happening!  Is this the only clip?  How many clips we got?  It was only two quick clips.  All right, yeah, you gotta...  Let's go to the clip.  All right, let's see if they describe where... 
[02:29:00]  Does it describe where  some of the kids were hiding?  Well, whatever.  Let's just listen.  We'll listen, and we'll fill in the gaps.  Tiniest of the time.  Primordial dwarfs.  I spent most of yesterday,  or some of yesterday,  with these kids.  All five of them.  And you wouldn't believe  what happened.  Watch.  Maury?  Hi, Maury.  I'm doing great.  Say, would you mind  taking care of the kids  for, what, 20 minutes or so?  I'll have a... 
[02:29:30]  Uh, okay.  All right, come on in, kids!  Hi, everybody!  Hi, Iumi, how are you?  Should we play a game?  Hide and seek.  You all want to play hide and seek?  Okay, you ready?  Yeah!  One, two, three, four...  Hide and seek at once.  Ah!  And the kids started hiding.  Jenna blended right in  on my bookshelf. 
[02:30:00]  Blended right in  on my bookshelf.  He took her.  Here's what they did.  The kid didn't hide there.  I know.  They picked this little  freakish friggin' troll doll up  and shoved it  on his bookshelf  to sit there  like a freak toy.  And which one of them  did you pick on the one  with a lantern?  The little creep he is.  Like a stuffed animal  on the shelf.  I couldn't even  distinguish it  from my pickled punk  I had up on the bookshelf.  Which one's in the jar  and which one isn't? 
[02:30:30]  No.  Oh, what a disgrace he is.  One, two, three, four...  Hide and seek at once.  Yeah.  And the kids started hiding.  Jenna blended right in  on my bookshelf.  Jenna!  How are you?  Look at you!  How are you?  Look at you!  How are you?  She's dying of old age  and she's nine.  How is she?  She's hilarious.  People want to correct us, though. 
[02:31:00]  This isn't Pejoria Kids.  They're...  Whatever.  Yeah, primordial dwarfism.  And the puppets  I was talking about  are the Giflings  from Dark Crystal.  None of those things  they look just like them.  Their faces.  And stop making...  You know, stop trying  to give them dignity.  They should all be wearing...  Like, you ever see  the Elephant Man  with those little  cut-out burlap hats?  That's where you get them  and you drag them  through a train station  while British kids  throw rocks at them.  And how are you?  I look ridiculous.  How are you?  And a man my height  can't afford to be made  to look ridiculous.  I look ridiculous. 
[02:31:30]  Look, I stepped on one.  Could you get a dustpan?  I hear some more  hiding places.  The hunt was gone.  Finding little people  was harder than I thought.  Imagine my surprise  when I found Bree  hiding in a drawer.  Yeah.  So here's the point  where he opens up  one of his, like,  desk drawers.  Or whatever.  He opens up a drawer.  It's like a little  file cabinet.  Whatever it was.  It was a small  effing drawer.  There's no way  the kid could have  closed the drawer.  So they put him in there  and closed him in. 
[02:32:00]  The kid is laying in there.  I can't remember the show.  I believe it was  The Munsters.  Do you remember  where Eddie used to sleep?  They'd slide him  in a coffin  or whatever it was.  That's what it looked like.  They open up this drawer  and there's this little,  it looked like something  you could see  in a goddamn  Barnum and Bailey  freak show museum.  It looked like a little,  it was a foot and a half  long kid in a drawer.  Put her in the drawer. 
[02:32:30]  Rick is reminding us  because the audio's  not on there.  Yeah.  He found one of these kids  in the garbage.  Yeah, that was one  of the kids he found  in his own little  waste paper basket  on the side of his desk.  A little, one of the  little black dwarf kids  were in the waste basket.  You know the little  waste baskets you have  around your office?  The ones that are only  about a foot and a half high?  That's cute.  Reminds me of an old joke.  You're throwing away  a perfectly good  black midget kid.  You know, I wouldn't  mind this so much 
[02:33:00]  if he just did it  the way I'd like it done.  Where could they be hiding?  And then he finds one  on the end of his fist.  Look, they're skewered  like shish kebab.  We're going to cook them.  I hear they're tender.  Me eating primordial dwarves.  Next, Maury.  Let's listen in more here.  Finding little people  was harder than I thought.  Yeah.  Imagine my surprise  when I found Bree  hiding in a drawer.  What are you doing there?  Well, you should know  you put me in here. 
[02:33:30]  You put me here.  You put me here.  All for ratings.  It's hard to...  Help me.  Help me.  Help me, please.  It's hard to find little people,  but if I want to find  a yellow person,  I just talk to my wife.  It wasn't over yet.  No.  Where could they be?  I mean, I've been looking 
[02:34:00]  all over for these kids.  Hey.  Are you me?  Hannah, how are you?  I'm missing one person.  A cup of coffee  will calm my nerves, okay?  Maybe that's what I need.  It gets in the coffee filter.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, Bradley.  Thank you.  Now we're going to go  find your parents  so I can get out  of this job.  All right?  After a long day  of hide and seek,  I must confess,  an afternoon of babysitting  with these tiny kids  was enough to leave 
[02:34:30]  this big guy  all worn out.  And at this point,  he's sitting...  Oh, Maury, look at you.  At this point,  he was sitting on a couch  with all of these  little freakish monsters  all around him  pretending to be asleep  like Maury's  pretending he's asleep.  And he's got his arms  around all five of them  sitting on a couch  like he's exhausted  from watching them  and playing hide and seek.  And the one line  I'd like to change  is that I'd like to find  the parents  and if you find the parents,  clunk their heads together  and set those 
[02:35:00]  genetic zeros on fire.  You know,  you would think  after maybe six months  and your ultrasound  turns up a walnut,  perhaps you should go in  for the friggin' abortion.  Jesus, man.  The camera's off.  We're done.  Get these freaks off of me!  I gotta go play golf.  He'd probably hop right  in the shower  so that dead skin flex  didn't get over his suit.  Hi, Maury. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, my name is Talking Tina  and I'm going to kill you.  Oh, stop.  That's what it looked like.  Little freakish things.  Highlight zone.  Hey, we got a Maury promo, Anthony.  An actual promo.  Oh, really?  He was running during this show.  Trolling.  Do you have a child  with an unusual physical disorder  and an unbelievable personality  like this?  Yeah.  Can I have a kiss?  Yeah.  Can I have a kiss?  Oh, can I have a kiss?  Call us at 1-888-45-MAURY.  Maury.  Can I have... 
[02:36:00]  He leaned over.  I don't know what was wrong  with this kid.  I don't know.  Had like...  What was wrong with the kid?  No arms or something  that he did that with?  He was like 30 or something.  I don't even know what it was.  Can I...  Because he goes up and goes,  Can I have a kiss?  Like, look at me.  I'm not even afraid  to kiss these effing freaks.  Could I have a...  Could I have some oral?  Please?  Connie doesn't give it anymore.  He's trolling for freaks. 
[02:36:30]  Let me put the lure back in the water  and see what we get next time.  See what dredges up on my hook next time.  Wow, look at that.  Please tell me you saw  when he had the fat babies on.  Yeah, yeah.  He had the...  The one big bloated fat obese baby.  The one fat baby  that was close to 200 pounds  and less than four years old.  And it wasn't bad enough  that they were going to parade  the fat kid on the stage.  They made sure he had a diaper on  and no shirt.  Yeah, that's all.  Put a diaper and no shirt on him  so he could walk around.  Perfect example.  If Maury's not exploiting these kids,  why is he having them walk out  in just, you know, 
[02:37:00]  a huge diaper and no shirt on?  He isn't exploiting them.  You can tell when he talks.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what's up?  You're a great kid.  You know something?  You're a handsome young boy.  You want a kiss?  Does your mommy want a kiss?  All right.  What a bastard.  And I love him.  I love Maury too.  I don't care.  The guy is... 
[02:37:30]  He's a monster on earth.  But he's trying...  But he's got these rubes  so bamboozled  that he actually thinks  he's performing a service  and helping these people  when in fact  he is the modern day freak show.  He is no different  than paying your money,  walking into the tent  and seeing the bearded lady  or the alligator skin guy  and the people  voluntarily bring  their freakish children  to him. 
[02:38:00]  Do you have a child  with a strange disorder  who won't tell?  Yeah.  They actually said  strange physical disorder.  Right.  Body's full of spunk.  The stranger the better.  Yeah.  Do you have a child  that his insides  are on the outside?  Bring him in.  Please.  Yeah, we'll throw vinegar  on him and punch his face.  Do you have a child  that'll dissolve  when salt is poured on him?  Like a slug?  Slug boy.  Let Maury pour salt on him.  You're a brave  little dissolving boy.  You're a brave 
[02:38:30]  little pile of goop  right now, aren't you?  We're going to send  this pile of goop  to Disney.  And we took our camera crews.  Watch.  as he dissolves  on the Matterhorn  bobsled.  Balloon not Joe,  what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'd love to see Maury  line those little kids  up like bowling pins.  Fire a bowling ball  at them,  see if they can get  out of the way  before it hits them.  Hey, we're going  bowling kids.  Or you could have Maury  have the Pejori kids  run around the studio  while eagles chase them. 
[02:39:00]  Balloon not Joe.  There he goes.  Look at him.  Look at the little bastards  trying to get away.  All right, we're here  at the bowling alley.  Go on.  I left one standing.  And MTV2 will rerun  the controversial videos  tomorrow at midnight.  Tomorrow, midnight.  You've got to check it out.  It's porno.  It's great.  On M2.  Bravo.  And we'll come back  and play What Do We Learn.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:39:30]  Two hungry sharks  in the world  of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  It's time to play  What Do We Learn  on the Opie and Anthony  show today.  Oh, my God.  I forgot, Ant.  Yeah.  We were supposed to  put the word out  for dwarfs and midgets  for tomorrow's show,  matter of fact. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, we just stepped up bad.  Guys, girls,  we need dwarfs  down at the station tomorrow.  Dwarfs.  If you see one on the street,  put them in your backpack  and bring them down  to the station tomorrow.  Mori, Mori Povich.  There are some rules  with owning  primordial midgets,  dwarf.  Never let it see light.  They don't like light.  Never get it wet. 
[02:40:30]  And the most important thing,  never feed after midnight.  All right.  Thank you for the rules.  Oh, my God.  They've turned  into freakish things.  Look at little Spike.  Hi, Spike.  You're a special  little gremlin.  Where's Hoyt Axton?  He's dead.  He's dead.  He's watching you have sex.  He'll be watching  tonight, right, Ant?  Yes.  Hey, uh, 
[02:41:00]  I'm dead serious.  We really effed up.  Remember we had  Dennis Leary on the show?  Yes.  What did we promise  Dennis Leary  the next time he came  on our radio show, Anthony?  Midgets.  Midgets and dwarfs.  Dwarfs.  I believe for Lenny Clark, right?  For Lenny Clark.  I think the whole cast  of The Job will be  on the show tomorrow.  Uh-oh.  I think they're bringing  in everyone tomorrow.  Oh, damn it.  And, uh,  we promised them  dwarfs and midgets.  What about that, uh,  little, uh,  dwarf stripper we had  on the show once? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, yeah, she had  such a great time.  She didn't, she doesn't?  That was the closest  thing to rape  we've ever done  on this show.  Well, we gotta find  some for tomorrow.  We're gonna look  really bad in the eyes  of, uh, Dennis Leary  and the gang.  Yeah, we need.  We are serious,  so if someone can help  us out with this,  please get a hold  of Rick, okay?  Dwarf chicks, especially.  Dwarf chicks, especially.  You're right.  Oh, we're effed.  Is there a number  you could call?  Maury.  Yeah.  What do you need?  Some dwarfs?  We gotta, we could barter.  Do you got any burn victims? 
[02:42:00]  I'll trade you  two burn victims  for a dwarf.  He has them on his shelf.  Yeah, he's got,  I got some dwarfs  on my shelf.  Isn't there a number  that's like,  oh, 1-800-  should have been aborted?  Oh, by the way,  Thursday on Maury,  we're gonna have  to get sound for this.  Thursday on Maury,  please, uh,  tune in for this one.  Uh, please don't stare,  we are not monsters.  Get out.  This ought to be  a banner show  on Thursday with Maury.  Now you're lying. 
[02:42:30]  No, swear.  That's the title  of the show?  That's the title  of the show.  Please don't stare,  we're not monsters yet.  Maury's gonna put them  on television,  and their parents  are gonna bring them out.  And you know,  he's the only show  that, uh,  where the ratings  are going up  year after year.  Of course,  he knows how to play it.  As all the other shows  fall by the wayside.  Well, your parents  were obsessed with you.  In the ratings  or get canceled,  Maury is still doing,  uh, very well,  because he's gone this route.  We want to see this crap.  What's the going,  uh, trade rate  on the, uh,  kid with just a torso?  Alright,  one kid with a torso  is worth what? 
[02:43:00]  Three thalidomide babies.  Hmm.  People might want to see  the flipper-finned children.  Hmm.  Do we have conjoined twins?  Oh, those conjoined twins  that sing country music?  Yeah, they're always good.  But they're kind of getting old.  I believe they're worth  at least one kid  with no brain  and spina bifida.  Jeez.  I hate those country  singing twins  joined by the head.  Oh, God.  They violate me  on every level.  We've discussed that. 
[02:43:30]  And Maury makes believe  that she really has,  has a future  in, uh,  the country music business.  Everyone is checking out  the freak singing  country songs  while her sister  is attached  to the side of her head.  Yeah.  Awful.  And to make believe  it's something  other than that,  you're insane.  Yeah, that's all you need.  You've got to come out  on stage,  the curtain's opening.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Ah!  Ah!  That big...  What?  We're playing country music.  The big, uh,  the big hit is, uh, 
[02:44:00]  just leave your twin  at home, son.  I knew that was  a too obscure  Johnny Cash reference.  Go home.  You stink.  Go home.  I knew it was too weird.  Go home.  Ah, Dave from Westchester.  I learned that getting an enema  is like running  the New York City  marathon backwards.  Today I learned  that all the thieves  in Long Island  now know  Opie has a big screen TV.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned  Grandma only looks down 
[02:44:30]  on Precious  when he's doing  good things,  not freaky things.  Oh, God, imagine that.  I hope you're rotten  in hell, you...  What?  Wow.  Some real love there.  You're a special  kind of grandson.  Sheep lover from Jersey.  I learned today  service people blow.  I also learned  that Dr. Philotoff  of Diamond Vision  is more gooder  than Jesus.  That's actually Jeffrey  from Queens Village.  Sheep lover.  I learned today  balloon fetish people  shouldn't be allowed  to vote.  I learned  a Maury Midget Kid  can pass herself  off as a book. 
[02:45:00]  That's from Haywood  from Yonkers  and the game  from Yonkers.  I learned today  to press one  if you're a peeler.  There's some great ones  but we got to get out.  I know, I know, Ben.  I know, we know.  Waving that big delicious  thing around the studio.  Listen,  we really need  to impress  Dennis Leary tomorrow  and Lenny Clark  and Adam Ferrara.  I think they're all  coming in from the job  for the show tomorrow  and we have to show  them midgets  and dwarfs.  Right.  If anyone can help us  out there,  I know this is last minute, 
[02:45:30]  please get a hold  of Rick, okay?  Yes.  We need midgets.  YV from Queens,  I learned that the heckler  at The Graduate  just wanted Kathleen Turner  to share her energy.  Hey, God.  I don't know  what that means,  right, Ant?  Not at all.  All right.  I guess we got to  step aside for Ron and Fez  here in New York, right?  Yes.  Peace. </pre>
