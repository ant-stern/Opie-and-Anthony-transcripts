<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic interview with Helen, a psychic who claimed to have consulted Babe Ruth's ghost about the Yankees' performance.  The conversation quickly devolved into a barrage of insulting and bizarre calls from listeners questioning Helen's credibility.  Topics veered wildly, touching upon Babe Ruth's afterlife, the JonBen√©t Ramsey case, and the validity of psychic abilities.  The segment climaxed with a call from someone claiming to be Babe Ruth himself.

Following this, the hosts shared a story about pranking a neighbor using a police scanner, culminating in throwing candy at her apartment and ringing her doorbell.  This was followed by cynical commentary and impersonations mocking Howard Stern's announced separation from his wife, fueled further by listener calls and speculation.

The show then featured John, a guest in the studio, who consumed five live mice on air, provoking strong reactions, disgust, and some listeners hanging up. The hosts and callers reacted with varying degrees of horror and amusement. This segment sparked a heated debate with a caller, Phil, who vehemently protested the show's promotion of the act and its implications for animal rights.  The hosts responded with increasingly vulgar and offensive jokes, including homophobic remarks directed at Phil.  This led to further calls, both supporting and criticizing the show.

Next, the broadcast included a deeply offensive segment mocking the media coverage of JFK Jr.'s death, filled with disrespectful language toward the deceased, his family, and news anchors.  This was followed by a caller criticizing the show's direction, warning against "going into the gay zone," which segued into a "Fag Talk" segment rife with homophobic jokes and derogatory terms.

An audition tape from a staffer nicknamed "Spaz" or "K-Dog" was then played and mercilessly mocked by the hosts and callers. K-Dog's tape was riddled with errors, including mispronouncing the station name, rambling segues, and awkward teases.  His commentary on the Million Man Youth March was particularly criticized for mispronunciations, inaccuracies, and offensive statements, including a racist comment and calling Hillary Clinton a "carpet muncher."  His mispronunciation of "encephalitis" became a running joke. Listener feedback was overwhelmingly critical and amusing.  A later segment featured K-Dog delivering a rambling, incoherent sports report, met with further mockery and derogatory terms from the hosts and callers.

The show also included a discussion of a radio ID recorded by Louie Anderson, highlighting Anderson's apparent lack of enthusiasm and reliance on fat jokes, which the hosts and callers found unfunny. A graphic phone sex call with Marco, featuring explicit sexual conversation, followed. The broadcast concluded with a prerecorded advertisement for a fictional "Rooster Rob's Cockfighting City," using crude language and references to cockfighting, and a caller recounting outlandish stories from Hurricane Floyd.  The entire broadcast contained extensive use of crude and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Every day, Opie and Anthony follow Leslie Gold.  We hope the restraining order solves the problem.  FM Talk at 1027.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  Well, we learned a lot about the jokes. What can I tell you?  Well, it started out with The View this morning, discussing it.  It was very informative.  We had an expert, a doctor. We had a doctor on, which I think legitimized the whole thing. 
[00:00:30]  We had a doctor.  I sure hope so.  So do I.  And then Lisa just called up.  We're talking to her.  She agrees.  Her doctor agrees that douching is not good for women because it eliminates the protective membrane shield in the vagina that keeps it from building up an odor.  Protective membrane shield in the vagina?  A shield, Opie.  Can you believe that? 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  Captain's log.  Godday 26609.  It's been five hours since the Nassim Gildoose eliminated our protective membrane shield.  The advantage is overwhelming.  Can't believe it.  Smells like a whore after two hours of racquetball.  Scotty.  Scotty, you've got to get our protective membrane vaginal shield back up. 
[00:01:30]  I'm doing the best I can, sir.  It won't come back.  Can't take it much longer.  Must go to the turbolift.  Take me to the cervix.  I think we've had quite enough fun today. 
[00:02:00]  Look what's behind us.  Plingons.  Things are just getting really silly in here, I don't think.  Yes.  It all started when the phones went dead.  God, did we have an informative show planned for today.  Yeah, we were going to talk about the commuter tax.  Commuter tax.  And how elevators aren't safe in New York anymore.  All right. 
[00:02:30]  The Knicks playing the Hawks tonight.  And where did we end up?  At the vagina.  Right.  Opie and Anthony.  One, two, seven.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at one, oh, two, seven.  All right, what do we got on the line here?  We've got Helen the psychic.  Helen the psychic. 
[00:03:00]  Where are they going?  She was up at Babe Ruth's grave getting some insight.  Okay.  On the Yankee closeout.  All right.  And there's a big article in the Daily News about her, right?  Yep.  Hey, baby.  And she went to Ruth's grave to see what he thinks about the Red Sox-Yankees series?  Yep.  All right.  Dee-dee-dee.  Hello, hello, hello.  Helen?  Hi.  Hi, it's Opie and Anthony.  We've got you live on the air in New York here.  Uh-huh.  How are you?  Hello?  Hello?  Helen?  Yes, hi.  Are you hard of hearing? 
[00:03:30]  I can hear you.  Why is other people hanging up?  What's going on?  Helen?  Yes, yes.  You lunatic?  Come on.  You got a call waiting or something?  Yes, I do, but I didn't pick up.  Well, that's the problem.  They keep clicking in.  Helen.  Well, it's finished now.  Is Babe Ruth calling you from hell or something?  Oh, God almighty.  That's terrible.  Come on.  Have a conversation.  Normal conversation.  We're trying.  We're trying.  You're the lunatic.  So you went up to Ruth's grave, right?  Yes, sir. 
[00:04:00]  And what did Babe Ruth tell you?  He doesn't tell me anything.  I don't speak to the dead.  Oh, you're a psychic.  If you read the paper, you'll understand that.  You're a clairvoyant, right?  Yes, I'm not a medium, right?  Well, why don't you explain for our listeners?  I don't need to read the whole article to our listeners today.  That's why we're having you on the air to discuss it, to tell them what's going on.  Mm-hmm.  So what do you do at Ruth's grave?  Well, we went up to the grave so that I could imagine or feel what this man would think  concerning the Yankees yesterday and was he rooting for them. 
[00:04:30]  They wanted to know.  And they also wanted to know about the granddaughter that's rooting for the Red Sox.  And what did you find out?  Well, I honestly thought that he had a soft spot.  I'm sure I've been told I'm wrong, but I thought he did have a soft spot for the Red Sox.  It wasn't his penis.  Because he was banging everything in sight.  You remember the babe from years ago.  Right, right.  Now, how are we supposed to believe this, Ellen? 
[00:05:00]  Believe what?  What you did.  You're feeling his vibe from heaven or hell or wherever he is.  Is he in heaven or is he in hell?  No, he's not in hell.  No?  No.  Well, why would you think he was in hell?  Well, he was a pretty, you know, banging broads and cheating on his wives.  Drinking and smoking.  Drinking and smoking.  You know, he was a pretty wild guy, the babe.  Yeah, but he was also a very gentle man.  Very good to children.  Yes.  Very generous with children.  So that gets you out of hell, huh?  Well, I believe that's very sincere.  My specialty is missing children, yes. 
[00:05:30]  I have a certain affinity with him since he was a, as Kazzy cared for those children the  way he did.  Who killed that little JonBenet Ramsey?  Oh, I have that, but I have no way to go with it.  Who do you think did it?  I have a sketch of who did it.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  Who did it look like, the babe?  Again, boy, I didn't know you had such an animosity towards him.  We love the babe.  I hear it, but my God, you're going to get some calls when I hang up this phone, and I'm  predicting that one.  No, Helen, I think you're predicting. 
[00:06:00]  You're predicting that?  I can prove you wrong.  You want to get some of our listeners on the line with you?  Not me.  You'll get them when I hang up the phone.  What, they're going to be pissed off at us?  Why would you think that he's in hell?  Well, because he kind of was womanizing, drinking, kind of a have fun on earth.  Earth kind of guy, and when you're like that, people say you might end up in hell.  He sinned a bunch there on earth, don't you think, Helen?  You're both very fresh.  Who am I speaking to?  What do you mean we're both fresh?  You're fresh, that you're calling, saying he's in hell. 
[00:06:30]  Who am I speaking to?  Which one's saying that?  Both of us, Opie and Anthony.  Both of you.  All right, so what else did you feel from the babe when you went to his grave site the  other day?  Well, first of all, I don't believe in the curse.  You don't?  No.  Well, not at all.  That's the reason they wanted me to go there, because of the curse.  Neither do Boston Red Sox fans, but...  I believe the curse is superstition, and I also believe...  Well, I believe it's more folklore at this point.  Excuse me?  It's more of a folklore. 
[00:07:00]  I think most people would agree with that.  Yeah, I do.  In that case, yeah, but the idea is that what if it was a curse, it reversed itself and  gave the Yankees luck.  Yeah?  They've been very lucky since he was on the team.  Am I right or wrong?  Hey, Helen.  Yes?  What do you see?  What do you see for the Opie and Anthony show in the future?  Well, I'm going to tell you.  You're going to have to change your attitude about people womanizing.  Why?  You want to...  You don't go to hell for that.  Oh, you don't?  No, you don't. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, then we'll all start womanizing.  No, you will not.  You'll change your ways and thinking the way you do.  All right.  If you're not...  All right.  Where do you...  Where are you two located?  You should know that already.  No, I don't.  If you could find missing...  That old gag.  If you could find missing children, you should at least know where we are.  Have you found any, Helen?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well, congrats.  That's pretty good.  Well, that's what it's all about.  The kids.  The important thing of the kids.  All right, Helen. 
[00:08:00]  So explain this to me.  The FBI goes to you, right?  They don't come to me.  Or you go to them, and they got some missing children cases, right?  Right.  And you help them out, and you kind of...  You find children?  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  It's been documented you have done that?  Yes.  Then why can't you tell everyone where we're located?  Yeah, we're alive.  We're alive.  I know you're in New York.  Okay.  Okay.  That's because you told me that.  Right.  And WNEW is in New York.  I know that.  Right.  It doesn't matter to me where you are.  All right. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  All I know is you're both fresh.  All right.  Hold on.  Someone agrees with you.  Hold on a minute.  Uh-huh.  Mike.  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  What's up?  You're talking to Helen, the clairvoyant.  Yeah, Helen, I totally have no idea what you're talking about, but there is a place that  you can go to get help for.  Who, me?  Yeah, it's called Four Winds Psychiatric Home.  Oh, my goodness.  Were you a patient there?  It gives you three square meals a day in a comfortable padded room, lady.  You are some weirdo.  Whoa.  How many...  Did you take acid to go hang out with Babe Ruth or something? 
[00:09:00]  I didn't hang out with Babe Ruth.  Well, you were sitting there.  You were feeling what he was feeling.  What was he feeling?  Was he feeling the Boston Red Sox going to lose?  I didn't feel anything but the rain that was coming down.  Oh, so you never really spoke to Babe Ruth then?  Yeah, she doesn't speak to dead people.  No.  When were you a patient in Four Winds?  Well, you should tell me that then.  No.  Hey, you helped find that little Katie Beers kid, huh?  Yeah, and a little boy in Jersey that was buried for 11 months.  How did you help find the Katie Beers?  Remember her? 
[00:09:30]  She was in that basement bunker.  Mm-hmm.  What did you tell the cops?  Well, I kept feeling a stereo, something to do with a stereo, and inside the house...  It was a stereo.  Wow.  Wow.  I got one in my house.  Uh-huh.  I also have a 10-year-old child in my basement.  To be honest with you, Helen, I did read that at the time.  That goes back how many years now?  Like five or six?  Yeah.  Babe Ruth with him?  All right, hold on, Mike, because now I'm getting serious with her.  Yes, Mike is very fresh, too.  Helen, I do remember reading about that, and I was pretty damn amazed. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, it was interesting the way it was found.  It was a shame that it wasn't found sooner, though.  But you still don't know where we're located.  Do we have to, like, kill someone or something for you to be able to find us?  No, you have to be missing.  Do you see something?  Do you see a stereo?  You know what you do?  Lose Mike.  All right, Mike.  And I'll search for him.  All right, guys.  He sucks.  You guys suck.  Later.  All right, bye, Mike.  It's hard to believe that you felt something from Babe Ruth from the grave, to be honest  with you.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I didn't feel anything from the grave.  All right.  I don't know what you read in the paper.  You read the paper.  Well, it's... 
[00:10:30]  Babe Ruth thinks the curse is ridiculous.  At the time, well, common sense.  Anybody would think there were the curse was ridiculous.  Yeah, but the paper wrote this, that you got that from the Babe...  No.  ...when you were at his grave over the weekend.  No.  First of all, if you read it that way, that's the way you're picking that up.  Did you say his spirit is hovering over the Yankees in Yankee Stadium?  As a Catholic, I explained that this morning to someone else.  As a Catholic, we don't die at the time our spirit stays alive.  Now, when our spirit is alive, we are all hovering everywhere. 
[00:11:00]  We are the spirit.  We don't die.  As a Catholic, we don't die.  We live after death.  I don't deal with spiritualism.  So he's over the Yankee Stadium.  The spirit of Babe Ruth is there.  Does he have to use the same restroom as everybody else?  Probably.  Yeah.  He's probably pissed there's no smoking.  That's terrible.  Yeah, I would be the same way.  He liked his cigars for Babe.  Uh-huh.  All right, Helen, let me put you on with Scott, who agrees with you.  Now, who is Scott?  Oh, my God.  I got another one now? 
[00:11:30]  Scott, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  All right.  I have a question for Helen.  All right.  Is there any truth to the rumor that you are the one that buries these kids just so you  can predict where they are?  That's pathetic.  Where did you hear that, sir?  That's pathetic.  I read it in a paper.  All right.  I got to hang up on Scott.  Scott, that's too outrageous for a show.  Yeah, that's a little much.  I, uh...  We apologize for Scott's call, Helen.  Helen, that wasn't nice.  I'm sorry about that.  If there was some way to tell what he was going to say before we picked up, maybe some 
[00:12:00]  type thing on the screen, we never would have picked that up.  That's all right.  Michael was worse than him.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, you think so?  All right.  Let's go to Peter.  Uh, Peter, what do you have for Helen?  Hi.  I happen to be a clairvoyant myself, and I'm getting some signals that this old bitch  should find her way back to Bellevue.  Oh, Jesus Christ, you're crazy.  Oh, Peter, Peter.  You are...  All right.  I've, I...  Helen?  Helen?  Well, once again, we have to apologize for Peter.  Mm-hmm.  That's another pathetic show.  Blew up. 
[00:12:30]  I don't understand where the bitterness is coming from here.  All right.  Uh, it looks like Murphy believes you.  Hold on a sec here.  Uh, Murphy?  Oh, we got a nervous.  How you doing?  What's up, Murphy?  Yeah, I just got off the phone with Babe Ruth's ghost.  Yeah?  First thing he told me is the Yankees should have never traded David Wells.  The second thing he said is that Helen is a psycho.  F Helen.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  That's a shame.  Yeah, Helen.  That is a shame.  Another pathetic show.  Yeah, Helen, once again, we got to apologize for our listeners.  I think they're all riled up because the Yankees are doing so well. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  That's probably what it is.  I think these are Mets fans wishing that they were doing as well as the Yankees.  Uh, hold on.  I got to get rid of Murphy here.  Uh, Helen?  Helen?  Yeah.  Yes, I'm here.  All right, I'm sorry about that.  Let's go to, uh, Babe Ruth on line three.  Babe.  Hey, this is Babe Ruth.  Yeah.  Calling from heaven.  I have a voice box, but I have to keep it up here now.  Anyway, I, she got my message wrong.  There are no hookers up here.  Send up some hookers.  It's really depressing up here. 
[00:13:30]  There are no checks up here.  I can't get a good steak.  I can't get any hookers.  I can't get any action.  What the hell's up with that?  Thank you, Babe.  Yeah.  The Babe checking in, uh, Helen.  I didn't know your show was a comedy also.  You guys suck, all right?  We, we don't think it's a comedy either.  All right.  All right.  I, I, I apologize for that, Helen, once again.  Um.  You listen to much radio, Helen?  No, not at all.  Not at all, huh?  Mm-mm.  But you watch TV?  Oh, I have a lot of people listening to your radio, and I guess they're all hanging themselves.  All right.  Um, well, let me put you on with Thomas. 
[00:14:00]  He definitely believes in, in this.  Again.  No, I'm serious.  It says it right on the screen.  Believes in Helen.  Uh, Thomas, what's up?  How are you?  All right.  Um, a couple months back, Helen, I had a question for you.  I lost a set of keys.  Uh, can you help me with that?  No.  Not if you lost them.  You probably had new ones made.  Why?  They're missing, though.  I haven't had new ones.  I said you probably had new ones made by now.  Uh.  Oh, did you?  Is that true, Thomas?  No, sir.  Oh.  Oh.  Hmm.  Okay.  Is there any, uh, can you get a vibe on his keys, Helen? 
[00:14:30]  No.  No?  No.  Because I probably never lost them.  Yes, I did, Helen.  Come on.  Uh, take care.  All right, Tom.  I'm trying to think of something maybe that I lost, uh, maybe you could help me with.  Oh, I don't know.  I haven't lost anything recently.  Uh, David, what's up?  What's up?  I was wondering if, like, Helen, she was up feeling the babe, but the babe actually was feeling  her up a little bit while she was there.  What was that?  What was that, babe?  Um, when she was up at the grave site, did the babe get a little bit of action then?  Very nice.  You know, she was feeling the babe. 
[00:15:00]  Did the babe get some action back?  Okay.  I...  These people are just appalling.  I am, uh, quite frankly, embarrassed, Helen.  Uh-huh.  I apologize.  I've never heard your program before.  Well, it's a little different than today's show, that's for sure.  We want to seriously discuss this prediction that the callers are, um, just, uh, ruining  everything.  Uh, Bill, let's, let's try to get the show back on track here, Bill.  What's up?  What do you have for Helen?  There was a little boy who was missing in Colorado. 
[00:15:30]  I was wondering, since that was really far away, if she has any sort of power on things  that are far away.  Oh, the little guy in the mountains you're talking about?  Yeah.  Well...  What if he was really far away, like, on Uranus, which is actually kind of close.  You probably know that.  Oh, my God.  Helen...  Yes?  I'm sorry.  Today's, today's youth is just out of control.  It's the kids today, uh, Helen.  Uh-huh.  They don't have any...  Those weren't kids, honey.  They were men, uh, men my age.  My God.  Kelly, Kelly, what do you have for Helen? 
[00:16:00]  All right.  My husband lost his wallet yesterday, and there was $600 in it, and I'm totally serious.  I want to know if she can tell me where it is.  Sounds like a nice woman.  Right, Helen?  She sounds nice.  Yes, she sounds human.  I'm nice.  I hear it.  Well, could you find lost wallets, Helen?  Well, I would only say in the car on the side of the car, the car seat.  That's the only way, the passenger side.  Ooh, very good.  You think so?  You will.  You'll probably.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you, Kelly.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Don't be an Anthony.  I'm calling this quits now. 
[00:16:30]  Hey.  Hold on.  One last call from Rich.  Uh, Rich, what's up?  Hey, Helen, how are you?  I just want to know if you, you know, being that you're so close to the spirits, do you see yourself  giving a rusty trombone in the future?  Well, Steve, I think that you have a long day, and I think you better go home and rest.  No, no, no.  It's Rich.  It's Rich.  You should have known that.  It's Rich.  You should know that.  I shouldn't have to tell you.  Uh-huh.  Opie and Anthony, I'm going to say goodbye.  Okay.  All right, Helen.  Thank you.  Thanks for a good day.  Thank you, Helen.  All right.  Coming on the show.  Bye-bye.  Take care. 
[00:17:00]  Bye.  Okay.  A rusty trombone.  And she should have known what one of those were.  I'm seeing a rusty trombone.  It's...  Phew, this smells.  You know, Ant, I'm disappointed in our listeners.  I thought we would tackle a serious subject today, and...  Oh, boy.  They always screw our show up like that.  I was really hoping to just do an in-depth interview with the psychic woman, and the callers  just...  Boy, they ruin it every time, don't they?  You know, I don't think they truly get our show, what it's all about. 
[00:17:30]  I thought for once we'd put the comedy aside and discuss a serious topic.  Helen, the clairvoyant, talking to Ruth, or not really talking to him.  And he's got a quote from the babe.  Quote from the babe!  Quote from the babe in the Daily News today.  He couldn't even talk when he was alive.  Toward the end.  With the throat cancer.  All right.  Hello, Helen.  I'm here.  Babe, I hear you.  Helen, I'm in my grave, and you're standing over it with a skirt, please. 
[00:18:00]  Could you move on?  That's quite a view I'm getting.  Looks like you got Phil Donnie's head and a leg lock.  Great hair.  Don't you get it?  That old cat.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Doody doody.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven.  You deserve the best. 
[00:18:30]  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at one, oh, two, seven.  Oh, my God.  I have a scanner.  I've had one for years.  And, yeah, you can pick up cell phones and cordless phones.  And the conversations I've heard over the years, hysterical.  I heard, I was out in the Hamptons once, listening to phone calls.  And a couple of, you know, a gay guy talking on the phone, you know, as they were a gay guy. 
[00:19:00]  They were talking about fisting.  Really?  Yeah.  It was hysterical.  Sitting there, I was like, listen to this guy going, you know, I'll bury it up for the elbow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  Heard breakups, drug deals, affairs.  It was great entertainment.  You'd have to sift through all the crap, you know.  I'll be home in an hour, honey.  Oh, great.  Good call. 
[00:19:30]  Tell them about the call.  We heard that one night.  Oh, what?  Up in the apartment?  Yeah.  We're all hanging out, drinking at Anthony's place, checking out the scanner.  Up in Boston, yeah.  Checking out the scanner, you know, and got a nice strong signal.  Heard some girl talking on the phone.  And she's talking to some guy about how her boyfriend sucks and how she kind of wants to get together with this guy and blah, blah, blah.  So, at one point, we're listening to the scanner, but we're also joking around and laughing. 
[00:20:00]  And at one point, I guess, we were laughing and I slammed the floor with my foot.  And I got stomped on the floor.  You know how you do that?  I'm laughing so hard, right?  A real knee slapper type thing.  So, all of a sudden, the girl on the phone that we're listening to on the scanner goes,  Oh, people upstairs again, banging.  Like, holy jeez, it's the person downstairs.  And then she starts going, Oh, it's not the first time.  They walk around up there like elephants.  I think they must weigh 500 pounds. 
[00:20:30]  And then she starts saying,  This is me, Jen, Opie, and his girlfriend, Sandy, sitting there.  I think there was another couple there, too.  Making it more embarrassing.  And we hadn't been on the air long together, so it's not like we had a friendship, really a good friendship.  You know what I mean?  We're still getting to know each other.  Yeah, still getting to know each other.  This goes way back.  Go ahead.  So, then she's like,  And their bedroom is right over mine.  So, all I'm hearing at night is, 
[00:21:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah, boom, boom, boom, that bad bad.  Ah, ah, ah.  I just heard him beat right on.  Look at it.  I hope he's laughing his ass off.  All night long.  It's disgusting.  Right.  Like, oh, well, maybe it's not downstairs.  But it was downstairs. 
[00:21:30]  It was, because then we started effing with her.  Because then we decided to play interactive phone call.  It was, I believe it was Halloween night.  Right.  So, she was kind of scared to be alone.  She was talking to this guy.  Well, I mean, your apartment complex, pretty much everyone was scared to be alone.  Oh, my God.  But when you look outside and you see somebody just bagged a zebra and were dragging it back into their lean tube.  I was in a bad neighborhood, man. 
[00:22:00]  When it would rain, I swear to you.  When it rained?  When it rained, it was the highlight of the day for the six billion little children that lived there.  Because they could play in the pothole puddles.  It was like a little pool for them.  I was just waiting for one of them to go to the shores of one of the puddles and have a croc come and grab him.  Drag him in.  I swear to this neighborhood.  There were people.  It was an apartment building.  Right. 
[00:22:30]  Outside of the little porch of your apartment, someone had fenced off a whole area, planted grass, and was raising chickens.  I swear to you.  It was the community property.  Yeah.  Like he took up three people's backyards because no one had a yard.  He had a cement patio with a wrought iron fence around it.  That's your yard.  This guy decides, you know, I am going to make a fence.  I am going to make a fence and raise a chicken just like I did back in Puerto Rico. 
[00:23:00]  And they would fence off the area.  Beautiful lawn.  I mean, he had it well kept.  Raising chickens.  So freaking funny.  Frightening neighborhood.  The second I moved in, like, what floor do you want to stay in?  What's the top one?  I want the high ground.  Love the high ground.  Every night the police were there.  There was something going on.  Some domestic dispute going on.  Someone's head was going through a wall.  It was wonderful.  So we're listening to the lady downstairs on the scanner. 
[00:23:30]  So she's kind of scared and she's talking to this guy.  So we decide to go out onto the porch, which is right above her porch, three high, and throw things at her sliding glass door from our porch.  So we're taking little pieces of candy and stuff and leaning over and winging it.  So we hear it hit the door and hear her go, oh, my God, what was that?  It was just so much fun because we're listening to the conversation and controlling what she's saying.  Then we decided we were going to ring her buzzer and run. 
[00:24:00]  So it was down on the first floor.  I'm on the third floor.  So Opie goes downstairs to the buzzer.  And after coaxing him for a half hour, come on, you've got to do it, you've got to do it, buzzes it.  I hear him start running up the stairs.  You can hear it on the phone.  On the phone.  Yeah.  And then I just hear this horrible, whoop.  He tripped going up the stairs.  Some getaway.  Because she was on the second floor, so we had to run past her floor to get back upstairs before she opened the door.  Because we were paranoid, convinced that if she opened up her door and I'm just casually walking like I'm there visiting you, that she was going to bust us. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  You know.  And it turns out the whole end to this whole thing is we got the guy laid.  Yeah.  Because she got so scared at what was going on, she said, you better come over here.  And he's like, oh, really?  She was like, yeah, I'm very scared.  Well, it's important to the story.  The guy talking to this lady was trying to pick her up the whole time.  Yeah.  And she's like, no, no, you know, kind of give him the brush off.  My boyfriend's driving by.  We got her so freaked out by the end of the conversation.  Yeah.  She invited him over. 
[00:25:00]  Invited him over.  Scanners are fun now, man.  They used to have a blast with those things.  That's a great story.  Forgot all about that.  It's beyond moronic.  It's beyond moronic.  It's sub-moronic.  Over here.  1027.  This is FM Talk on 1027.  Talk you can't ignore.  No matter how hard you try.  It's O&A.  212-757-1027.  If you want in on the show today, the fax number, 212-957-9639. 
[00:25:30]  TJ, what do you have for this mess today?  I wanted to know what you guys think of the whole Howard thing.  I think it's a huge hoax.  You think?  Definitely, because he's probably got a book coming out or something, you know.  Well, I don't know.  I don't think it's a hoax.  Really?  No.  I don't know.  Sounds legit.  I'll tell you one thing.  Howard should get separated every day of the rest of his life because it made me listen this morning.  Right.  You know, I felt like I was back in 1988 where you couldn't turn the radio off to listen to him. 
[00:26:00]  You got a point.  But honestly, that aside, I thought he sounded like a girl.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He just likes people to feel sorry for him.  Yeah.  It's like he was acting like he's the only person in the entire world that, you know, has gotten separated.  Sounded legit, but this guy lies.  Honestly, I think it's legit.  Sure.  Why not?  But it just, I don't know, it just sounded like.  It's not one of his, like, things that he would do, I don't think.  It doesn't sound like it either. 
[00:26:30]  It doesn't go with his.  It's hard to tell.  He just sounded like a girl, you know.  I don't know.  In the old days, if something like this would have popped, he would have had his wife on the phone.  He would have had his mom and dad on the phone.  Maybe even his kids, but I don't know.  It's new Howard.  He just sounded like a girl.  I'm wondering if he left her for Ralph.  Well, maybe listen this morning.  But like I said, yeah, he should get separated every day for the rest of his career because it made me tune in today.  I don't know.  What do you think, Hank? 
[00:27:00]  I don't think it's a hoax.  I don't think it's a hoax.  But with that said, and I think you were saying it earlier when we were in commercials, he's going to take advantage of this.  I think everything he said on the show today was pretty much crafted by a few publicity people.  I think it's in his best interest with his female listeners to come across like, you know, hey, we still get along great.  We're working this out or trying to or, you know, still talking to each other or spent the weekend together.  I think that is publicity agent talk. 
[00:27:30]  You know, I just don't think it's in his best interest to show his sensitive side.  But that's not the reason we all, like, you know, grew up listening to him.  And then at the end of the show, he had all his, like, cronies around, and they're all, like, feeling sorry for him.  And he was loving every minute.  He loves people who feel sorry.  They were all just talking like, oh, God, how we all feel bad.  And, I don't know, everyone's talking about it and how it's going to affect the show and us and if you're going to be okay.  And, I don't know, man, you know, we're worried about you, you know. 
[00:28:00]  Secretly, we're all talking about we're real worried about you and stuff, you know.  Why are you worried about him?  Well, I mean, it's just silly.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, Dylan?  I think Howard's leaving his wife to go jockey the joke man.  All right, Steve.  Don from Great Neck.  Ease back on Howard, bros.  Some of us love both shows.  What do we do?  We're talking about the frigging news story.  Oh, we're not supposed to even talk about it?  What are you, a jackass?  Bill, what's going on? 
[00:28:30]  Guys, I love you, but it seems like you have no material today.  You've got to pick on the poor guy.  The poor guy?  Come on.  He's right.  We've had a lot of stuff on today.  The poor guy.  Look, being Stern fans, you don't think after 20 years on the air, he hasn't picked on maybe a couple of people?  Oh, yeah.  When they're down?  Yeah, but the guy's doing the right thing for his kids.  Oh, shut up.  I can't believe that.  You know something?  I'll accept anything else today except the guy calling up and saying that you'd better be nice to Stern during his little low point in his life here. 
[00:29:00]  Screw you, man.  If it was anyone else, he'd be right up there.  I know, but you've got to feel a little bit for the guy.  No, I don't care.  He sounded like a girl this morning.  Admit it.  Most of us listened to him this morning.  I don't like hearing the sensitive Howard.  You know, he just sounded like a girl this morning.  Anthony, Chris from New Jersey making a pretty good point on the instant feedback. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I think that with age comes a loss of testosterone.  First, there was George Steinbrenner losing it and crying after the World Series last year.  Yeah, we've seen that.  He used to be the tough Georgie, right?  Yeah, from the 70s, sure.  And now Stern.  Yeah.  Kind of getting a little soft this morning, a little more emotional, a little more sensitive.  What's going on with all these tough guys?  Chris from Jersey suggests that we start a new bit called Corky Stern instead of Corky Steinbrenner.  I'm not listening. 
[00:30:00]  Why did you?  She's separating me.  Jackie, what do I do?  Robin, Robin, you're the only bitch I can talk to now.  Show me your cans.  Talk to yourself.  Oh, I love him.  Please watch my TV show, please. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, what do I do?  You want us to bring in some lesbians so you can feel better?  Bring on the lesbos.  You're on the air.  Hi, Alex.  Yeah, me and my 19-year-old niece had a lesbian. 
[00:31:00]  I don't care anymore.  I don't care.  Howard, would you like us to bring in Boyd Garris so you can make fun of him?  Maybe that'll help you get out of this depression.  That poor man's been through enough.  Leave him alone.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry about the horse-toothed jackets.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  So you're starting to appreciate the people that help your show, Fred and Jackie.  Ralph, you faggot.  It's the new sensitive Howard.  It's the new sensitive Howard.  You're starting to appreciate the people that have helped you get to where you are.  Don't get carried away.  Oh, okay.  You don't wish Tom Chiasano would die anymore?  No.  Come on. 
[00:32:00]  Give me a hug.  Howie needs a hug.  Will you be banging broads to get over the loss of Allison?  Allison.  Oh, John DiBello, I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry what I did.  Imus, I love you, Imus.  Grace, man, give me a kiss. 
[00:32:30]  So you really want to make up with Imus now that you're more sensitive?  Man, cow, I need you.  New sensitive Howard.  Very sensitive.  That'll be okay.  We'll cuddle you in the back after the show, okay?  Look, I'm sucking snot up this pig's snot.  Ted, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, dude?  I think you finally turn it tight. 
[00:33:00]  I think I'm going to begin to listen to his a lot more than I did Howard because he's kind  of run his course.  I think after 15 or 20 years, it's a dead horse.  You're going to get Corky Stern, you know, crying again here.  It's the sense of God with Howard.  We all sit here yakking about how much Howard is hurt by this.  Can you imagine being Allison Dern for 20 years?  Oh, my God.  Talk about, like, having a halo over your head, you know?  And now we've had black nuts for a whole lot of time. 
[00:33:30]  The guy, like, watched himself for a rental answer.  I want to hear black music.  Why are you so fine?  I've seen you again for so long.  Jackie, give me a beer.  I understand you were not friends, but I heard you and your little friends.  My post won't cure this one.  I'm not going to part a dream.  I'm not going to get to a sense. 
[00:34:00]  Let's go back to that.  Let's go back to that.  Because I don't want you to check it.  Get her on the phone for me.  I only know it is a man.  Allison.  Skill is Allison. 
[00:34:30]  Ralph, my makeup's running healthy.  This isn't funny.  Robin, show me those big black cans.  Oh, my God.  Shake my back.  I'll shake my back.  I love everyone now.  I'm a sensitive stick.  I'm so sorry what I said about you.  You're a scientist in your cowboy. 
[00:35:00]  I can't stop you from talking.  Hear the several things that you say.  My kids are going to have someone else to call daddy.  I'm a sensitive guy.  Because I can't stand for you.  You're a little way.  I'm a sensitive guy.  I'm a sensitive guy.  Stop, you son, I'm sorry when I haven't said everything else, I'm sorry. 
[00:35:30]  My ass to the car.  My ass to the car.  Please remember to watch my TV show Saturday night.  My ass to the car.  Mr. Simmons, please come back on the show.  I need to cry with you and hug.  My ass to the car.  My ass to the car. 
[00:36:00]  Jimmy J's, I love you.  My ass to the car.  Dice, you are talented.  My ass to the car.  Stunnery John, your band rocks.  Sam Kinison, help me.  Oh, Ed, it's about time someone hates you on the show. 
[00:36:30]  Here they come.  John, what's up?  Yeah, Obie?  Yeah.  How could you say that Howard was a pussy this morning?  He was, man.  Aw, dude, he's been married to that chick for 25 years.  25 years?  25 years.  You guys are horrible, man.  Anthony, I'd like to see you stay with your wife for 25 years.  I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't be, I wasted 25 years. 
[00:37:00]  I couldn't begin some great quim.  Oh, no, he ignored all that for so long.  How could you bust on him like that?  Oh, it's Billy West.  I love you.  Hey, he gave me this voice.  Billy.  You got sick, man.  I hope you bust your bum.  John, thank you so much for supporting me.  John, I love you.  Uh, Laura, what's up?  Hello?  Laura. 
[00:37:30]  Why is everyone being so mean?  I know, they're being so mean to Howie.  Please call and kiss me.  Hug me.  Howie needs your help.  You sound like a wanting, flaming homo.  Howie needs your help.  Hey, show me your cans, honey.  Hey, there's pig virus from NBC.  I love you, too.  Look, I can do it with WNBC. 
[00:38:00]  WNBC.  I love you, too.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you, too.  I love you, too.  When does your CD come out over here?  I love you, too.  Wow, the sensitive Corky Stern.  The new sensitive Stern.  Oh, we might pay for that one.  But, damn, was that funny. 
[00:38:30]  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  Get that, get that.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven. 
[00:39:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  Hey, neighbor.  My name is Henry Dickens, proud proprietor of Dickens Apple Farms.  Home of the best apple picking in town and some of the best apple cider this side of the Mississippi.  Now, if you want to satisfy your thirst, then I don't recommend cola and I don't recommend lemonade.  You should do what people have been doing for the last 69 years.  Getting their dick inside. 
[00:39:30]  Hi, this is Albert Bell from the Chicago White Sox.  Many people know me as a big old a-hole because I like to pimp slap a bitch.  But the only thing better than pimp slapping a hoe is getting my dick inside her.  I think you know what I mean.  Thanks, Albert.  You know, people come from miles around to get their dick inside her.  Hi, this is Ed Klee from Klee Motors.  I'll never forget the best day of my life when I helped a woman find her Klee Taurus. 
[00:40:00]  Then I had my dick inside her.  Mmm, mmm.  What a day.  Just think, every morning you can wake up, roll over, and get your fresh dick inside her.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  How can I get my dick inside her?  Well, it's hard.  But we do it all for you.  Here to explain our patented process is head squeezer, Connie Lingus.  Well, first we take the apple and we ram it in the slot. 
[00:40:30]  Then we split the core, pushing the core in and out, in and out until the seeds explode from the tip.  And next, we add this secret ingredient, the stem.  Remember, you just can't get a good dick inside her without a long, hard, firm stem.  That just goes to show you, there's nothing that can beat a dick inside her.  Try it by the gallon.  Or, if that's too cumbersome, for easier packing, try a dick inside her can. 
[00:41:00]  Or for picnics, try a dick inside her box.  And don't forget, during those cold winter months, there's nothing better than a hot dick inside her.  People come from miles around to get their dick inside her.  Come visit us today on the Hershey Highway, right next to coal and cleaners.  Get some today.  The Opie and Anthony, 1-8-2-7.  All righty, what's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:41:30]  Today's worst of...  Man, you guys are going to love me.  A lot of requests for Jay Moore.  That's coming up later on, probably around the 5 o'clock hour.  We've got some Broken Jaw, Louie Anderson on the way, Star Jones a little bit later,  Dr. Smith from Lost in Space.  Tons of stuff, plus some great bits in between the very few songs we are going to play.  And, digging deep, from like, almost, what, five, six months ago, the Spaz Radio Audition 
[00:42:00]  Tape.  My God, you're going to pee your pants if you don't remember this, if you missed it, if you did hear it and remember it was kind of funny.  No, you're going to pee your freaking pants.  I just had to sit through a whole hour of that stuff.  Holy crap.  And that's coming from a lot of your suggestions, man.  So, keep those suggestions for the worst of coming.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's going to make you pee, some of the stuff that you're going to hear come out of this thing. 
[00:42:30]  It's really, really some funny stuff, including the whole giant mosquito thing.  So, listen up for that.  That's coming up.  I'm going to do that somewhere between 4 and 6 o'clock.  It's going to just be, like, all three sections.  It's just going to be huge.  You're going to have a lot of fun listening to it, all right?  There we go.  Today's worst of, in a nutshell, any requests for it, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Or, you can even fax them in at 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W.  And the instant message is up and running. 
[00:43:00]  So, if you've got any ideas, let me know, all right?  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  The talk you can't ignore.  All right, it's FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  Talk you can't ignore.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Just a few moments away from watching John eat a few mouses.  Live pinkies, little mice.  I think we should also say the instant feedback, which has been down for quite a while, is back up and running again. 
[00:43:30]  So, if you're sitting in front of your computer and anybody wants to comment about this via the instant feedback,  you go to the website, go to our names, and you'll see where to instantly e-mail us.  Here at the studio.  TJ.  Yeah.  What's up?  At this point, I don't think someone can pay me to change the dial.  And I can't wait to see the pictures at www.foundrymusic.com. 
[00:44:00]  Too bad you slurred the foundry part.  Thank you, TJ.  Bye.  All right, Ant.  You know, we could string this along for another hour, but it really would not be fair to our faithful listeners.  How many votes did we get to save the mouse?  Well, we talked to three, maybe, two or three.  And how many to have him eat it?  Every single person on the screen wants him to eat it.  Then I could make a conscience vote and say, I vote no.  Puss.  Peter. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  How are you?  All right.  I think you should eat it.  He's got to actually show you that he's chewing it and then open his mouth.  I swear I'm going to throw up.  I swear to you, I am going to puke.  Peter, talk to Owen.  He says don't do it.  Hold on here.  Owen, you're talking to Peter.  Yo, listen, I'm all for it.  It's just that this sounds pretty serious.  You guys are going to get thrown off the air for this or something.  I don't know.  I don't want to see that happen.  I don't think any of your listeners want to see that happen.  And I'm glued to my radio like everybody.  I don't think we're going to get thrown off the radio.  Maybe suspended for a long time, but we need a vacation anyway. 
[00:45:00]  John, what are you thinking?  All right, let's go.  I can't believe you're going to do it.  There's five of them on the counter.  I can't watch so I can describe it.  He's got a beard.  How am I supposed to do that?  Oh, God.  Is he going to chew?  I'm just going to swallow the first one and we'll progress from there.  First one, I'm just going to swallow.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, man.  All the girls are just, what's wrong?  Grab a mic.  What seems to be the problem? 
[00:45:30]  What?  What happened?  I thought we were all just kind of having fun here.  They're actually kind of cute.  They are cute, right?  Yeah, see, when you kind of look at them for a while, they kind of get little personalities,  don't they?  What's the problem?  I don't want to think about their personalities.  Really?  Strong.  Yeah.  They're all cuddled together.  They want to do his sleep.  I know, they're all cuddled.  They're keeping each other warm.  They could sleep in the duodenum.  Maria.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, I will vomit so badly if I have to listen to this guy eat those things.  Oh, God.  I was listening yesterday when he got on and said he would do that. 
[00:46:00]  I almost got sick in the car.  But in all honesty, you can't turn the dial, right?  You have to listen to this, don't you?  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, Maria.  I just warned you two minutes beforehand.  I will turn the radio off, and I might have to turn the radio off because I really think  I would be sick as well.  I believe we've hit the point of no return.  John is really psyched and ready to do this.  He's ready.  God, no.  You know, just say, this is your two-minute warning.  You're going to start to eat the mice so I can just turn it off for that part of it. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  We're in the two-minute warning.  Sure.  Yeah, thank you, Maria.  Let me get off.  Bye.  Don't eat it yet, John.  Like, you know, have it dangling over your mouth.  Oh, God, look.  Oh, no.  I can't watch this.  It's moving.  It's moving.  It's legs are moving.  Oh, my God.  He just put it in his mouth. 
[00:47:00]  He's swallowing it and washed it down with a beer.  It is done.  He has swallowed a moving, living mouse.  Holy.  Oh, my God.  No.  Did you see the little feet poking out?  They were sticking out in the leg like he was trying to walk.  The little pinky.  He was trying to escape. 
[00:47:30]  One of his mom picking him up, moving him to a nest.  Oh, my God, baby.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  I'm going to be a few.  I believe the other four have realized that they're missing one of their brethren because  now they're like, now they're moving around the counter like crazy trying to find the edge  of the counter.  Oh.  All right, John.  First of all, John, how did that feel?  It's a little strange.  Do you still feel it?  When you put them in your mouth, they're trying to like climb back out. 
[00:48:00]  Do you still feel anything moving inside you there?  No.  Only for the first like 10 seconds, you feel a little scratching.  I'm going to puke.  He swallowed that one whole.  He held it by the tail over his mouth as its little pink legs were moving.  And he put it in his mouth.  Little mouse like blood veins.  Trying to pull.  Swallowed.  Pumped blood.  And Kenny.  Watch the thing. 
[00:48:30]  Yo, guys.  Yeah.  This is really foul, man.  Yeah.  I got to agree with you.  Hold on before John moves on here.  Paul, what's up?  Dude, I can tell how many people are listening to the radio because they're puking on their  windshields.  Oh, my God.  That is so disgusting.  Wait.  Just rule, man.  All right.  Wait until you see the pictures on the Internet.  I can't wait.  I'm going to go home on the computer and hit it right away.  It can take a couple hours, but all right?  Okay, man.  All right.  Later.  The image of the little struggling pinky over his mouth will stick with me for the 
[00:49:00]  rest of my life like the two little twin girls in The Shining.  All right.  I think that scene I just saw is now the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  Chris, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I'm driving home from work, guys.  I'm about to drive into a bridging bank, but you're going to be kidding me with this.  I mean, really?  This radio show, this is like a hole in the air.  Chris, you know, we didn't even expect it. 
[00:49:30]  We were going to say on three, and all of a sudden, he just went for it.  Oh, man.  All right.  You guys are needing some profound help.  You've got a great show, by the way.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Why don't you put one on your tongue there, John?  And it's not even looking anymore.  Oh, it's...  Oh, turn around, turn around, turn around.  No, no, stop it.  Oh, God.  He bit it.  He bit it.  Oh, God damn it.  Come on, man.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  He bit it with his front teeth.  He bit...  The thing was crawling on his tongue.  He thought it was a little mouse hole.  Look, I got to puke.  All right, wait.  The girls are in shock.  What's the problem?  No, it's revolting.  It really is.  That little poor mouse was trying to get out, and he bit it.  He bit it.  Please stop. 
[00:50:30]  I'm speechless.  I don't know what to do.  John, I didn't expect that.  I don't know.  In the cartoons, they always get away.  Tom and Jerry, Speedy Gonzales, not here, Opie.  He didn't get away.  He was in his mouth.  I thought maybe the little guy would pull out a stick of dynamite and blow his head off  and run for the mouse hole in the wall.  But no, he chomped down.  Holy smoke, man. 
[00:51:00]  James.  Yes.  You think this is ridiculous?  Yes, I do.  This is ridiculous.  All right.  This is insane.  I don't think this should be on the air.  Okay.  Yeah.  Who is this?  Our GM?  Francesca.  Yes.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  You guys are crazy.  Before I go to school, I have to work.  I go to the drive-thru to get my dinner.  And I was on drive-thru.  I ordered.  And I was just about to the pay window.  And as soon as the guy ate the mouse, I just took off.  Oh, really?  I just took off.  Didn't pay for it.  Didn't pick up anything. 
[00:51:30]  This is the new Opie and Anthony diet.  Oh, my God.  It'll work.  Believe me.  It'll work.  All right, Francesca.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Chris.  This is the most disturbing day in the history of radio.  Scott Muni is totally in his grave right now.  The guy ain't even dead yet.  Well, yeah, that pretty much sums it up, Chris.  And we are considered a comedy show.  Yeah.  This is unbelievable.  You guys are the best.  You guys are a big hairy puppy.  I love you.  All right.  Thanks.  Well, we're ready for the grand finale, John. 
[00:52:00]  Whatever you want to do.  You got three left.  Oh, no.  Why don't you hold all three up to the camera?  Oh, all three.  Nice big smile.  We're going to try to get these on the unofficial website ASAP.  Felicia's got a problem on line 10, Opie.  Oh, you guys.  I can't believe you actually let him do that.  I don't know.  I'm disappointed.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  I've been listening to you guys ever since you've been on the air.  Yeah.  Can we make it up to you? 
[00:52:30]  You want to stay on the line while John does one more here?  No, no, no, no, no, no, please.  Uh-oh.  He's going for a double.  Oh, he's got two.  He's got two.  You better hang up, please.  Oh, he's been chewing him up.  Oh, he's chewing him up.  He's chewing him up.  He's chewing him up.  Oh, he's trying.  He's going to write it on the phone.  No.  I can't believe this.  Bill.  Give him a guard, Bill.  That's going down well.  Oh, my God. 
[00:53:00]  And you guys are just doing this because I pulled up.  Now, wait a minute.  Look, I'm feeling a little faint.  Oh, but you look pale.  I thought I knew you better.  Can I show you?  Okay.  All right, there's enough vomit in here.  There's enough.  I got to go home.  I just got to get out of here.  All right, that was really tough to see at the end there. 
[00:53:30]  Three at one time.  Ladies, what do you think?  Any comments?  At least they're out of their misery now, and I hope his is starting.  I really hope you're getting a stomachache for this.  I feel pretty good.  When you put the three in your mouth there, your whole face changed.  Did you get a picture of that?  Yeah, that looked really bad.  For a second, you thought you were going to have a serious problem.  Yeah, they all kind of ran in different directions.  Oh, their little pink body is trying to dodge his molars.  Oh, Bill. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, man, two things real quick.  First of all, this is why you guys are never going to get syndicated.  You know, only New Yorkers can handle this stuff.  For a little while, you know?  You know, if that's okay, then we'll never be syndicated.  This is the type of stuff that you just got to do every once in a while.  All right, Bill.  Take care, guys.  Love the show.  All right, bye.  Well, and I guess John's segment is done.  Let's hear it for John.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Not an enthusiastic applause by any means there. 
[00:54:30]  Well, I'm still a little weak.  Opie, you're a sick-ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a stud.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sexy.  1-0-2-7.  Bill, what's the problem?  I wanted to get the email address of the general manager.  Are you like the idiot that just wrote that email that we just read?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Well, see, there's no talking to people like you.  Oh, I see.  I mean, you guys, you know, you're so demented that you don't see any harm in doing this or promoting it. 
[00:55:00]  I can't believe that you guys would actually not only allow this guy to do that on air, but also promote it.  Yeah, yeah.  And then these sick losers listening to your radio station who are actually cheering you guys on.  Bill, are you like a vegetarian and everything?  Yes, I am.  So, do you use any products from animals?  No, I don't.  No leather or anything?  I'm vegan, no.  Okay.  I'm just getting a little feel of what you're all about there, Bill.  The thing is, though, but wait a second.  Even if, I'm not saying I'm against people eating animal flesh. 
[00:55:30]  If they're meat eaters, that's it.  You know, I can't say anything about that.  John likes mice.  What can I tell you?  But you know, yeah, okay, whatever.  Well, you know he's not doing it for that.  You guys are just doing it for rating.  Is that right?  If this guy comes up with the idea that he wants to eat mice to win a trip to Hawaii, who are we to say no?  Just think of it this way.  If it was somebody that you guys love, no, seriously, if it happened to somebody that you guys loved, would you be promoting it? 
[00:56:00]  You can't equate somebody you love with a little mouse.  No.  I understand it is an animal, but you cannot put it on the same level as somebody you love being tortured and some guy eating a mouse, Phil.  Wait a second.  No, actually, you can.  If you're an animal lover, you can.  So you love animals with the same passion that you love your family?  Is that what you're saying?  Phil, that's a little sick.  No.  I can understand your pets and everything, but every living creature on the face of this earth, if somebody's ready to step on a mite, would you get upset like your grandma's getting gang-banged in prison or something? 
[00:56:30]  No.  I think that's taking out of proportion.  Well, you're...  Not really.  This is what you were telling me.  This is your logic.  No.  My logic is...  Would you go out and save subway rats?  Probably not.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  There are people out there that love subway rats.  Okay, if people were killing them just for the joy of it, then yeah, I would. 
[00:57:00]  Like sitting on the platform, plinking them with the .22s or something.  Yeah.  For sport.  If it was for sport, or not even for sport, because people are so demented they think it's okay, but if they were doing it just out of cruelty, because they want to see another living thing die, then yeah.  Yeah, then I do think that I would...  This guy did get some nutritional value out of the mice, whether that's what he was going  for in the first place.  He did consume them.  Okay, but did he kill them first?  Does the boa constrictor kill them? 
[00:57:30]  Does the boa constrictor have any other way to survive?  Actually, they do.  They kind of squish them first with their little body in a swatting hole.  Well, the constrictor needs to eat those things to live.  This guy...  Wait, wait.  You didn't meet John.  He needs these things to live.  Well, then I have no pity then what happens to this guy.  Hey, Phil, I beg you to contact all the groups out there.  You'll just make us bigger.  Yeah, but...  Well, that's just it.  All of these groups, of course, it's going to make it just... 
[00:58:00]  It's going to make it glamorous, and everyone's going to think, wow, this is cool.  Let me listen to the show.  But I'm sure not the advertisers, because advertisers are a little different.  The advertisers don't want negative...  Oh, you scare us.  You know what?  You guys are right.  Why don't you talk...  I'm an animal.  All right, listen, Phil, I'm going to give you a break here.  I'm going to put you on the line with Todd, who agrees with your stance.  Let's see if you guys can hammer this out.  Todd?  I want to...  Phil, are you gay?  Yeah, actually, I am.  What difference does that have to make with an animal being killed?  Now I understand why there's a difference. 
[00:58:30]  You're a very sensitive guy, Phil.  No, I understand why he's so pissed off, because he's gay, Anthony.  Why?  He wanted to, you know, shove the mice up his...  Oh, Opie!  I think that's an inappropriate remark, Opie.  I didn't say where the mice...  You know, he wanted to shove the mice up.  He didn't even let me finish it, Phil.  I personally want to apologize for Opie's rude statement about sticking mice up your keister.  He's a little more compassionate, because, you know,  he feels a bond with the mice. 
[00:59:00]  Let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  You're not a meat eater?  No.  Oh, yes, you are.  You eat too big with me?  Okay.  Yeah, I do, but I don't inject it.  I don't know that.  Cruelty to penis.  Well, you have a different view on animals on this planet than some other people do, Phil.  Some people see them as a lower life form.  We're at the top of the food chain to be used as we wish here on this planet for as long as we're here. 
[00:59:30]  You see them as cousins and grandmothers.  And butt toys.  Play me.  I'm trying to carry on a conversation with Phil.  Oh, my.  Opie's doing butt jokes, Phil.  Yeah.  John.  What about that?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Phil, mind your own business.  Oh, why don't you shut up, you fat f***?  Oh, that's what I am.  That's what I am.  Mousy, dougs, and dougs, and dougs.  You little lamb that I be.  Are you actually telling me you have more people on air right now or more people that are supporting what you're doing? 
[01:00:00]  Um, yeah.  Go get a grip.  What's your problem?  Oh, my God.  You don't like to change the station.  And be like the Pied Piper and lead them to freedom.  Hey, Mark, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I'll free you.  I'm not in a state category.  Yeah, but let me... 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Come, little Mike, friend.  Come to freedom.  I am the Pied Piper.  Mice, follow me.  Follow me, mice. 
[01:01:00]  I'm the Pied Piper.  Is Phil walking down Christopher Street, saving all the money from his fellow gay brothers?  Hey, Tony, Tony, what do you have for Phil?  Oh, yeah.  Somebody's got to shut this guy up.  He's just ridiculous.  Phil, are you there?  Yeah, I'm here. 
[01:01:30]  Do you have any idea what a jackass you're making out of yourself?  Yeah, it's to people like you, so it doesn't count.  Oh, I don't care.  Just, look, you think I care?  Oh, my God.  Look, you guys, you've got to be the most ridiculous person I've ever heard in my life.  No, no.  You know, Phil, sperm cells are living creatures.  Enough said.  Enough said.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure you ingest enough of them yourself. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right, why don't you talk to John, the guy that ate the mice, Phil?  Well, I just want to know why he did it.  You did this just for the tickets?  For a trip to Hawaii to meet ONA, yes.  And you have no remorse whatsoever, do you?  No, I'll come in and eat another dozen.  I don't care.  They're feeder mice.  That's what they're bred for.  They're bred to be fed.  Okay, what else would you eat?  Well, that's it.  I don't know.  Would you?  Not you, Phil.  Yeah, John, I think that was a pickup line. 
[01:02:30]  Be careful.  Is this the best radio you guys can come off with?  One-oh-two-seven.  One-oh-two-seven.  You guys in conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  One-oh-two-seven.  One-oh-two-seven.  All righty.  You see, that's part of the deal, okay, is to piss people off.  So remember, we've got some stuff coming up.  It is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What do we have coming up?  By request, I've seen a few times so far on the instant message, they want to hear some 
[01:03:00]  broken jaw.  The JFK Jr. coverage in particular, that will definitely piss some people off.  Louie Anderson making a return engagement, that will piss some people off, at least the  fat people.  Jay Moore is going to be stopping by.  Marco, you better get your pants ready, or at least a towel or something.  We'll be replaying that, plus a few more things with Jay.  Fight Club, another edition of Fight Club coming up as well. 
[01:03:30]  Just a whole lot of stuff, including some old Bill, Bob Dole falling down, some dirty  Columbo.  Lots of great stuff, including Da Da Dave as well.  So I've got a ton of great bits in store for today's worst of.  Make sure you give a call, 212-757-1027, so we can get as many great things on for you  today and tomorrow as well.  Remember, the guys returned Monday, January the 3rd, year 2000.  Wow, wow.  If you're leaving the area, whatever, Happy New Year. 
[01:04:00]  Let's return to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 1027.  You've got to talk about Star Jones on the show, Anthony.  Anthony saw The View, what, yesterday morning?  Yeah, yesterday, The View, Barbara Walters show.  Star Jones, I just cannot stand.  Yesterday, they proudly display a copy of BBW Magazine. 
[01:04:30]  Now, we've learned about BBW on this show because of the famous spaz who enjoys the BBWs.  Right, big, beautiful women.  Women, right.  And just adorning the cover of BBW this month was Star Jones.  And they're all just like, look how beautiful Star looks on the cover of BBW.  Look, it doesn't, she looked gorgeous.  And is anyone believing it?  All right. 
[01:05:00]  And she's just, like I always said, laid out on this huge bed, wearing this big moomoo-looking thing.  That's a big black and white moomoo thing.  The Mrs. Roper outfit, right?  Yeah.  She looks like Shamu.  It's this big black and white thing looking like Shamu.  And everyone says she's beautiful.  And it says, the diva for the year 2000. 
[01:05:30]  Well, you know something?  If that's the diva for the year 2000, on New Year's Eve, right before the ball drops, drop a cinder block on my head.  Because if that is what...  Yes, we are communicating with Star.  Well, this means she's angry.  Yes.  See the way her back comes up out of the water?  And then she rolls over and her fin slaps the water like that? 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  You ever see Star eating?  No.  It's cool.  She takes the seal and knocks it with her tail.  They play with it for a while.  You'll never know, too.  The little seals are playing.  And Star comes swimming right up on her huge belly and just grabs one.  And then slowly goes back.  And then you can see her about 100 yards offshore batting it around with her huge tail and her fins.  They don't know why she does that. 
[01:06:30]  But it's just part of the...  Because she's a diva, Anthony.  A diva.  She's a diesel.  Far cry from a diva.  Then she has a bet that she makes with somebody down in Texas about the Knicks-Spurs game.  Yeah.  If she, if the Knicks lose, which they did, Star had to get on a horse and sing the Yellow Rose of Texas.  What does it say here?  Dressed as a cow.  Oh, dressed in a cowgirl gear.  Oh, sorry.  I thought I would pick the one that would have been more appropriate. 
[01:07:00]  You wouldn't know how to get dressed up?  Yeah.  So she's dressed like a cowgirl on horseback.  Oh, man.  In Central Park.  Where?  Is PETA.  Is PETA.  Exactly.  Honestly, when someone the size of Star is on a horse, I'm sorry.  That's got to hurt the horse's back.  They can only take so much.  Yes, I know, boy.  It's okay, baby.  Don't worry.  Oh, look at him. 
[01:07:30]  His back looks like that swayback horse from the Little Rascal.  One of those pulling little fire truck and Stymie would make the boxing glove come out and punch the kid.  Looks like that horse now.  That's okay, boy.  Oh, wait.  That was Star.  No, this is Star.  Star horse.  Oh, the poor guy.  Star horse. 
[01:08:00]  Where is PETA when she is getting up on a horse?  That must have been something, too.  I used to ride, you know?  You've got to kind of put your foot in the stirrup and you swing yourself up.  It's kind of cool, too.  You kind of do the Clint Eastwood thing, you know?  You grab the saddle horn.  You just roosh.  You're right up on the back.  That must have just been some view.  Watching her big fat ass trying to get up on a horse.  Oh, yeah, right?  Grab a forklift.  Or one of those things that they use to get the fat guy out of the house. 
[01:08:30]  Let's lower her onto the horse.  Bill.  Yeah.  Are you talking about cat holes?  What?  You're talking about bulls' eyes.  Who's cherry bumps?  What the hell are you talking about?  You're talking about cherry bumps.  We've got the cowardly lion on the phone, everyone.  Oh, boys, I love honey holes. 
[01:09:00]  I love it.  I love those pictures on your website.  Oh, honey holes.  What the hell is wrong with you, dude?  I don't know.  Somebody gave me some anal-natric.  You are out there now.  I'm sorry, boys.  I disturbed the show. 
[01:09:30]  The freaks are coming out of the woodwork today.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  All right.  Bye.  Man.  Melissa.  Yeah?  Please say you're normal.  I'm very normal.  All right.  What do you got for the show?  I don't know.  I just have to laugh about your comments on Star Jones.  Why?  That cracks me up.  Oh, good.  She's nasty.  She's nasty.  She thinks she's beautiful.  That's a scary thought.  All I have to say is she's a man, baby.  You know, I don't care. 
[01:10:00]  I really wouldn't care if she just looks like she does and does the show and everything's  fine.  But everyone's so full of crap.  They're all, they all pump her up to this, pump her up.  They all pump her up to this organization where she's like this diva.  Who appointed her diva?  Who the hell did that?  And they all, they're all so politically correct on the little panel, all the rest of them, that  they're all just, look how beautiful you look.  You look beautiful, Star. 
[01:10:30]  And she's like, damn right I do.  And then they're all talking about their men and stuff.  And she's like, well, I wouldn't put up with that.  I'm Star Jones.  I'm a lord.  I wouldn't put up with that.  I'm a diva.  I'd rather bang Barbara.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh.  You have the chance to bang Star Jones or Barbara.  What do you do?  Standard Barbara boffing or maybe, what do you mean?  Barbara.  Who's Barbara?  I don't know.  Barbara Walters.  Barbara Walters.  Do Barbara?  I would bang. 
[01:11:00]  I'd rather bang you down.  Maybe.  You down.  Maybe.  What's the situation?  All right.  Star Jones or Barbara Walters.  Who do you bet?  Do I get to do Barbara from behind?  We're going to do it, doggies.  Stop.  Ladies and gentlemen, boys.  I must say, I would have to go Barbara.  Barbara?  Yeah.  From behind.  Oh, yeah.  Barbara?  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Star Jones is just nasty. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, that's great.  Harder.  Harder.  You're doing so well.  This is wonderful.  I would have to say Barbara.  Yeah.  Although, not Star.  Anyone but Star.  Monique.  Hi, guys.  What's up, Monique?  We love Monique.  I got the issue right in front of me.  Oh, the BBW with Star Jones?  And she is nasty because here in the article it says, I change my wig every day depending  upon my mood.  Yeah.  That's not her hair.  Yeah.  She wears these wigs and then they showed her backstage ones. 
[01:12:00]  They did this whole expose on The View backstage.  She has freckles all over her face.  That's nasty.  They powder it all down.  Like RuPaul?  Yeah.  Just like RuPaul.  That's nasty.  I think it is RuPaul.  She looks like RuPaul.  I have my stink under all that fake hair.  Oh.  Is she with the...  She's got a wig.  Imagine that.  Yeah.  When my man comes home and whips my wig off.  I'm lucky.  And look at my freckled ass face.  Never mind a wig.  Rolls me over. 
[01:12:30]  Well, Monique, first of all, why are you getting the BBW magazine?  Because I'm a BBW.  A BBW.  Yeah, but why do you need to see other BBWs?  A little lesbo action there?  No, not with nobody my side.  Well, do they have naked women in the BBW?  No.  That's more in Bell.  Bell magazine, huh?  Yeah.  They got more naked women in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I don't feel so bad because, see, in BBW, they show these women that...  They have, like, they're big, but they don't have, like, no jelly rolls and no dips and dimples, you know. 
[01:13:00]  So I read it for the articles because I can't afford the clothes anyway.  But in Bell, they'll show the big women with the rolls and stuff, so I don't feel so bad.  Now, you've, of course, everybody knows, you've smuggled stuff into your man in jail in your most intimate of areas.  What do you think Star Jones could smuggle into prison in her vagina?  A Buick LeSabre?  What do you think?  Man, that thing ain't been open yet.  You may be able to get something under them wigs, though. 
[01:13:30]  You got to oil it up, dust it off, and creep that damn thing open.  I don't know.  You can't get past the kneecaps.  Size is too big.  I don't know.  She just lays out there like, I don't know, and they all feed her.  400 pairs of shoes.  400 pairs of shoes.  Sure.  They wear out when she walks on them.  It's like, damn, these were high heels an hour ago.  Now they're loafers.  What happened?  Where'd the heels go?  Might as well make the soles out of pencil erasers. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, right?  How fast they're rubbing down when she walks.  But I mean, on the wig, don't she wash her hair?  That's nasty.  I wash my hair.  I put it in the washing machine and wash it.  She's got that bald-ass head.  What does she got?  Like, what's under the wig?  What's under the wig?  Like a big, baldy head?  Probably, and a pantyhose net stocking.  Well, that's great.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah, that's nothing. 
[01:14:30]  That's what you want to do.  Go to bed with the guy that looks like the ha-ha-ha, 7-Up.  Yeah, that's who you want to bed down with.  Take your wig off there, star.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Ben Goldberg.  This is sicker than faces of death.  And we're here.  Help me, William. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, dear.  Woo!  Dr. Smith in the studio today.  Spare me the poisonous bob, Zopie.  I wish.  Oh, will I get home?  Sweet home.  Woo!  William, I'm a pedophile lost in space.  I was going to say that.  You are a pedophile lost in space.  Yes.  What have you done to William?  Oh, dear.  Take him into his little room and tuck him in for bed?  Woo!  No chicks for me.  No.  Maybe little Penny. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Little Penny.  Yeah, why didn't you go after Penny?  He was a piece of ass.  That's what everyone would have expected.  Right.  That's what the Robertson family expected.  They never thought I'd go after young William.  No.  And then Major West.  Yeah.  Major West screwing Judy.  Woo!  Fine piece of gas, but she's a girl.  I like young boys like William.  Wow, this is an exclusive.  Are you finally admitting this on our show today?  Yes.  Yeah? 
[01:16:00]  Dr. Zachary Smith, pedophile.  Woo!  Lost in space.  My schween is like the robot's arm.  Warning, warning.  Oh, dear.  Help me.  Hey!  I have a robot in my pants.  You can't figure that out.  Help me.  Wow!  I want to go home, sweet, sweet home, where I could coach a boys' soccer team or something.  I'm getting tired of young William, the same little supple ass every night. 
[01:16:30]  Help me.  Oh, dear.  I'm always fouling things up at the hydroponic garden.  I was going to say, if you really wanted to go home, why are you always getting everyone in trouble?  I can't help it.  Yeah.  I'm a buffoon.  A pedophile buffoon.  Young William.  Oh, dear.  Looks like a plucked chicken, doesn't he?  Come on.  Take him off in that stupid little vehicle we're driving.  Have a threesome with that pointy monkey. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, dear.  Help me.  Help me.  I want to go home.  Help!  Dr. Smith, everyone.  To start off the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, boy.  Got to love having a TV in the office.  Yeah.  Helps the show tremendously.  Did you see him?  I did see him, yes.  Dr. Smith, he had some fat opera star after him or something.  In a Viking outfit, right?  In a Viking outfit. 
[01:17:30]  The best part was another stupid prop, though.  Yes.  I had this wacky hatchet.  It was a wooden hatchet.  You could tell it was wooden.  And then they painted it like gold to make it look like some type of metal.  Oh, dear.  Not that much of a budget on that show.  Help me.  William.  What was he doing with that hatchet?  Nothing.  I'm a big pussy.  Yeah, because...  I'm such a pussy.  I'm always hiding behind young William.  Right behind him.  Yes.  Very close.  Yeah.  Very closely. 
[01:18:00]  Very closely.  Why are you so close to the boy, Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Very close to the young boy.  Very close.  Dr. Smith, my senses are reading you're getting a boner.  Whoa!  Shut up, you clattering clunk of collidious junk.  Of course I have a boner.  Hey, Dr. Smith.  Look at the boy.  Whoa!  Is it true you're exploring black holes in space?  Yes, black holes.  Yes.  Where's Gary Coleman?  Whoa!  Whoa!  He at least looks like a young boy. 
[01:18:30]  Pardon me.  Dr. Zachary Smith would like a blow-up doll in the shape of an eight-year-old boy.  Yes, William.  Whoa!  Something in a hairless model.  Oh, dear.  Dr. Smith, you sick son of a bitch.  Yes, I like them like a plucked chicken.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Dr. Smith, you are a pervert. 
[01:19:00]  Shut up, you bobble-headed booby.  Whoa!  Dr. Smith, remove yourself from that boy.  Shut up.  You cannot deny me the simple pleasures being lost in space.  Whoa!  Help me!  I can at least get a little trim from a plucked chicken.  It's the later episodes they're airing now that William was getting a little too old for me.  Yeah, what was...  Reaching the age of 13 or so.  I was going to say, what was he, 10? 
[01:19:30]  Why can't they just stay eight years old?  Whoa!  What a trusting family.  Letting me take him out on an empty planet to do whatever I please.  I can't say that, Rick.  Shut up, you bobble-headed booby.  At least we didn't have to deal with spics.  Whoa!  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  Cunnilingus and psychiatry bonus to this.  On FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  She's part girl, she's part boy. 
[01:20:30]  She's got parts everyone can enjoy.  She's got more, she's got less.  She's got her manhood tucked in her dress.  Yeah.  Is she a mister or is she a miss?  Does she stand up when she's taking a piss?  She's my little girl, she's my little guy.  When I try to please her, I get poked in the eye. 
[01:21:00]  She wears lace and she wears flannel.  She watches football and the Lifetime Channel.  What's that bulge under her nightie?  It's just not her mephrodite.  Yeah.  Her mephrodite.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Some things are white.  Some things are black.  Some girls wear makeup.  Mine shaves her back.  She is still beautiful.  She is still fine.  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine.  She looks like Cher but she's built like Sonny.  She loves Brad Pitt and finds her three suit just funny. 
[01:22:00]  Who's that girl with the grip so mighty?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whoo!  Yeah! 
[01:22:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  Oh, God.  Stick a lanch, everyone.  You know, you don't write that without the experience.  The Oprah & Anthony Show.  I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  Hey, what's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the Opie and Anthony Show,  and stupidity is what we have in store.  Yeah, spaz radio coming up starting later on this hour.  That's all I'm going to say.  That's all I'm going to say. 
[01:23:00]  I swear to God, when you hear this, you will pee in your pants.  If you're in your car, you might want to slow down when you hear certain parts  so you don't drive off the road.  All right, also, Louis Anderson by request,  Jay Moore by request, including his phone conversation with Marco.  Just tons of stuff.  All right, so if you've got any more suggestions, 212-757-1027.  That is a phone number.  Also, instant feedback is working, so I'm getting those as well.  So everybody who's waiting for Brokenjaw, wait no longer. 
[01:23:30]  As we return to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  F you to all this news coverage of the JFK Jr. thing.  You've had it?  Totally had it.  Enough already.  You turn your TV on.  Boom.  Hours of coverage now of the memorial service in New York,  which has just screwed the roads up. 
[01:24:00]  Clinton comes in.  Everyone comes in.  And the news is working it like it's the Oscars.  I swear to God, I'm watching it because I couldn't get away from it.  It was on every channel.  Every channel.  Limo after limo is pulling up.  And the people are talking like...  And here's Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger in a conservative suit  walking his way up the stone stairs to the church.  Yeah.  And now here's Ted Kennedy getting out of his limo looking very somber. 
[01:24:30]  No crap, he's looking somber.  He's looked somber for a week now.  And you've showed every single piece of it.  I mean, they should have had Joan Rivers out there on the carpet  if they were, like, doing it like the Oscars.  Jesus Christ.  No, no.  William Kennedy Smith, look at him.  Hey, rapist, come here.  Where'd you get those shoes?  Ted, what are you wearing?  Look at you, you fat pig. 
[01:25:00]  Put down the Twinkie.  I wouldn't be caught dead in a suit like that.  Maybe I should use that word here.  What do you think, Melissa?  Well, Mom, shut up.  You skinny little leech.  They were treating it like the Oscars.  Now, Anthony, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people taking this JFK Jr. thing very, very serious, okay?  Which is fine.  I don't care how you feel about it.  Let me ask you one question, though. 
[01:25:30]  If he wasn't, like, a GQ type of guy, would there be as much coverage?  No, no, no.  If he was just some schlep who moped around New York, went to the same places, did the same thing.  But wasn't as handsome.  Right.  If the chicks didn't find him attractive, you wouldn't be seeing this.  And don't lie to yourself and stop bitching at me.  You know it's the truth. 
[01:26:00]  If this got magazine editor, right?  Mm-hmm.  You know our buddy Mark Golan?  Sure.  Works over at Details now.  Right.  You think if he looked like Mark, it'd be...  Look, I like Mark.  He's a great guy.  Mark's coming in soon.  I can't wait to tell him what you said about him.  I'm just saying, if he looked like that, it wouldn't be making a big deal.  If the whole couple, the three that were flying in the plane, him, his wife, and the other one,  a bunch of fashion models flying across a crash, you'd think they... 
[01:26:30]  It wouldn't be a big deal.  I have a better example.  Donald Trump.  Right.  Pretty much just as famous as JFK Jr. in this town and across America.  Uh-huh.  If Donald Trump passed.  Yeah.  This kind of outpouring under the same circumstances?  Press coverage?  No.  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  You're seeing this because he takes his shirt off and plays football in Central Park,  and the girls were walking with crazy glue dripping. 
[01:27:00]  That's why you're seeing this.  Wow.  You'd think the girls would be going up to that door and leaving flowers  and picture after picture of them just weeping and weeping.  Don't forget the poems, Anthony.  People were writing poems.  Right.  Poems.  If he looked like Michael Kennedy, right?  If he would have gotten the chipmunk Kennedy look?  That's distinctly different Kennedy looks.  Yeah.  There's that chipmunk look, which, I don't know, the girls don't seem to go for.  Mm-hmm.  And then the John-John look, which just spurs a week's worth of coverage on memorial service. 
[01:27:30]  Well, I imagine after today it's finally over.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I think tomorrow we'll get...  It's been a week since John Kennedy Jr.'s plane was missing.  And my mother calls me up.  She doesn't call for anything that we do on this show.  And we've done some sick stuff.  And she listens every day, right?  Pretty much.  She's listening right now, I'd imagine. 
[01:28:00]  I would probably think.  Okay.  You know, the JFK Jr. stuff was a little much.  I'm like, Ma, the show isn't for 60-year-old women, number one.  And then she's all, you know, you're going to have to talk to your Aunt Fran because she's pissed at you, too, with the JFK things.  You know, we liked him very much.  And then she goes, and who couldn't?  Because he was some hunk.  Prove my point right there.  I go, what did the guy do for you? 
[01:28:30]  Did he do anything for you?  Memories of him saluting the coffin of his...  Oh, please, if I see that picture one more time.  He had no idea what he was doing.  Look, he was a great guy.  He lived his life here in New York, just like many of us do.  They keep saying a regular guy.  Went into the bars and actually drank and talked to people.  All right.  Any other regular guy dies, what happens?  He'd still be down in the bottom of the ocean.  And you know when he saluted his dad during the funeral procession. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, you think at three he thought that one up himself?  No, but they have footage of the Kennedy family on vacation.  Yeah.  Where Jacqueline was teaching John John how to salute.  Of course.  So if you see the footage, you see her bend down and whisper, you know, salute.  Do the salute.  And he saluted.  He had no idea what he was doing.  No clue.  Didn't even remember it.  But I mean, the coverage and everything, a little bit of overkill here, people.  All right.  I'm tired of hearing the reasons why it is. 
[01:29:30]  They were all on the news.  It's Tom Brokaw.  And today it's wonderful to see John F. Kennedy Jr.  It was a man who lived his life like many of us would have liked to live our lives.  Tonight on Nightline, 18 continuous hours of coverage of John John Kennedy with me, Tom Brokaw,  NBC Nightly News. 
[01:30:00]  We start with photos of John John as a zygote.  In the womb of the first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, here it is.  The pictures of the JFK sperm as it swam up Jackie's crop, fertilizing the egg that will  later make John John.  Well, how much more can they do, for God's sake? 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  This is wonderful.  Here's John John attaching himself to the wall of the womb.  We're going to do this broadcast in real time.  So in nine months from now, I'll still be on the air.  We'll do a little deliberate.  John Brokaw, I'm going to say Nightly News.  Here's Jackie in the labor.  Look at John John's head poking out.  Already that full, thick head of hair of his, popping out of her. 
[01:31:00]  Gah.  I'm getting really tired of it.  Wow.  We don't need more Tom talking.  And it's all the same stuff.  Yep.  John Kennedy was assassinated.  You see, little John John's saluting the casket.  Oh, that's the billionth time we've shown it today.  Well, fine.  Here's John John playing football in Central Park like a real human being. 
[01:31:30]  Anthony, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what's going on, you guys?  All right, go.  Hey.  It's funny that Anthony's talking about that.  I wanted to send an FU out to Tom Brokaw.  Oh.  I was listening to him the other day, and he says, and JFK Jr.'s playing on the way to Martha's Vineyard,  where there's fine vineyards, people in white, lots of tennis courts.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Because they have nothing left to say. 
[01:32:00]  Exactly.  You know what?  End your broadcast.  There's nothing left to say.  Done.  I know.  Martha's Vineyard, let's go back a 10 billion years and talk about how Martha's Vineyard was  formed.  The glaciers pulled back north after the ice age, leaving deposits of soil, which later  turned into the tragical occasion of John John's Tale.  Who is this Martha, and where is this vineyard? 
[01:32:30]  We'll be doing an exclusive report.  Me, Tom Brokaw, tonight on NBC Blackly News about Martha and her vineyard, the place where  John John was trying to walk away from him.  Thanks, Anthony.  You guys are the greatest, man.  Keep it up.  All right, man.  Later.  Bye.  I'm sorry for the people that are really touched by this and stuff.  You know, it is a sad thing, but I've had it with the coverage.  Let's move on.  Mr. Brokaw, do we have footage of John John's first duty after he was born? 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  The potty training of a little John John Kennedy.  Here's a picture of his first dump.  Which I believe was green corn or some type of spinach from the disgusted look on older  Jack Kennedy's face.  You may have seen that look lay around during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  But this one is because he smelled John John's first crap that we have exclusive pictures of.  Running down the beach. 
[01:33:30]  Here he is smelling a little flower that Jack gave him on the beach.  Here they are on the rowboat again.  Oh, we've shown that one 10,000 times.  Ah, here's the Challenger explosion.  Has nothing to do with John John, but we just don't have any new footage of John John.  We've shown it already.  Danny, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say that it's just horrible how they overcover some of these deaths like they do with Diana.  And I mean, they keep saying all over the news how he said, led such a quiet, graceful life. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, why doesn't the media be quiet and graceful and shut up about it already?  Oh, let the man die in peace.  That's the kicker, too.  Oh, it's lovely to see the Kennedys getting the privacy from the media that they've been at.  I've heard him say this!  Yeah, well, they've cordoned off the area around the church so no press could get in.  But we have a satellite camera filming every step of everybody.  You know, because we appreciate the privacy that they wanted.  They showed everything.  Camera in the coffin. 
[01:34:30]  Very good, Danny.  All right.  All right.  Paul President showed Charlie the tuna taking a bite out of John John's ass down there before they took him up.  I guarantee the news agencies did everything in their power to try to get a picture of JFK after they took him out of the water.  Of course!  It's probably gone rotten dot com in no time.  They took pictures with that little robotic camera.  Yeah.  And we have them right here.  Now, due to the graphic nature of this, we'll be giving you a warning.  We are going now to the bathroom of the Kennedy compound where Al Roker will try to find any pubic hairs that might have fallen out of John John during him taking his last leak. 
[01:35:00]  I mean, what are we looking for, people?  The coverage has been the same crap rehashed 800 times.  Carolyn Kennedy, now all alone, the last remaining member of what was referred to as Camelot. 
[01:35:30]  For your Camelot, one more time.  Fuck!  Now, Katie Couric in the kitchen looking for scraps of food that John John may have salivated over before that tragic crime crash that claimed the life of him as a piece of ass bride.  Wow.  All right, we're off to a great start today.  Thank you, Tom Brokhoff, for stopping by the radio show today. 
[01:36:00]  You're welcome.  Continuous coverage of the John John Royal Services from now until the year 2010.  Could you do us a favor and, you know, stick around for the show today?  We'll just pop in to pop to you every once in a while?  Sure thing.  I'll keep you updated.  We ran out of footage, so I'll be making claymation creatures to reenact what it would be like if John John was still here.  Here he is.  Wait.  Okay, he's walking to work at George Magazine. 
[01:36:30]  Look, he's being a regular guy.  I'm Brokhoff, playing with the claymation figure of John John.  Well, keep away from the little airplane, people.  Don't worry.  I don't think your mom's going to be talking to you for a while.  My mom could kiss my ass.  You must know evil before he can condemn it.  Lopey.  You must see evil before he can condemn it.  D'Anthony.  This is disgusting and very, very cool.  M.  Watch. 
[01:37:00]  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore.  Hello?  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand.  What's getting out of hand? 
[01:37:30]  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really, but...  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky, licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun.  But you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside. 
[01:38:00]  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  Going into the gay zone.  Going into the gay, gay, gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, you know, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Oh, yeah.  Gaze, gaze all, you know.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Huh.  Licky, licky.  Licky, licky.  Lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky, licky.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  That's fun.  Going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Going into the gay zone.  Not really.  Going into the gay, gay, gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Something's pokey, pokey in the butt.  Don't mean licky, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  Yeah.  Fun.  Licky, licky, yes, but pokey, pokey on the butt. 
[01:39:00]  Kobe and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fags!  1027, this program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello and welcome to Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags,  or as they call them in America, cigarettes.  We have Bob the Fag Man with a very special box of very special fags today.  Yes, indeed, we have a big box of big fags.  They call them cigars in America, around the world, of course, 
[01:39:30]  but we like to call them big fat fags.  That's right. The nice thing about big fat fags is they're more specialised.  You don't just find them lying about wherever,  but you go to a special shop and they're all there.  They all sort of hang out and all.  Kind of a fag shop.  Right, there's like on display and you go through and you look  and you smell and you taste and you see which fag you want.  Which fag is for you.  Which fits your nice, you know, right in your mouth in a big way.  Right.  Or a smaller fag that might just slip right in your mouth. 
[01:40:00]  Right, right, right.  And it was wonderful.  Bob, again, this has been a tremendous and very educational program.  And that box of fags is for you.  Oh, no, I couldn't accept it.  Oh, look at those beautiful fags.  We'll all share in the map of the show.  Thank you so much, Bob, for being here.  And join us again next time on your own TED Talk.  Opie.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point  where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble. 
[01:40:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We've just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  One, oh, two, seven.  Hey, what's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the Open Anthony Show.  Doing the worst of four today, tomorrow the last worst of until the guys return live in studio on Monday, January the 3rd.  God, I love that fag talk bit.  We've got to play more of those before the end of the week.  Any requests for bits?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, our own fag man spaz. 
[01:41:00]  He's going to be featured in these next bits.  He's also going to be working the phone, so ring him up.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Instant feedback is working.  Taking lots of requests for bits on that.  Ah, let's not delay it any longer.  It's the first installment of Spaz Radio.  Crank it up, check it out, especially if you've never heard this before.  And if you're in your car, I hope you've got airbags.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  On FM Talks at 1-0-2-7.  It's Opie and Anthony, and in the studio, we've got Spaz, our buddy, our pal, who works  on the radio show.  He hasn't been on the radio in a couple weeks, thank God.  But he's been busy screening the phone calls for the radio, and he does a great job.  Right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  I think we could agree on that point.  Well, Spaz gave me his radio audition tape as I was leaving the building yesterday.  Because I, I guess, wasn't worthy enough to listen to it and offer up an opinion. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  My total lack of radio experience that Spaz sees it.  Yeah.  Well, Spaz.  What?  Do you realize this is the number one radio market in the country?  Yes, I do.  Do you realize pretty much whether you like them, hate them, or what have you, anybody  in a major market radio has enough experience to critique a college radio tape?  Yeah.  I'm almost insulted. 
[01:42:30]  If it wasn't coming from you, I would be insulted, but I couldn't possibly be insulted.  I apologize.  Yeah.  Well, that's okay, Spaz.  Once again, Anthony and I played the tape.  I don't like you were in Iowa.  I think I'm an intern at an Iowa radio station.  You can't critique my tape.  So, Anthony and I checked out the tape while we were stuck in traffic on the way in today,  and you kept us very entertained.  I mean, usually we have major road rage, especially with the 59th Street Bridge being 
[01:43:00]  effed up like it is lately.  We were stuck in traffic.  We didn't care because we were laughing so damn hard.  That is a fact.  That is a fact.  People were looking at us like, what the hell are they listening to that they're laughing  so hard?  We should have had hockey helmets on for what we looked like in that truck.  Swear to God.  Well, Anthony, there's already people calling in because I told people to call up and comment  about Spaz's radio audition tape.  Yeah.  We haven't even played any of it yet, and people are already calling in.  Well, I would love to know what someone would have to say before they hear it. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  Dude.  Yeah.  Well, guys, I couldn't even imagine what you guys were like on the bridge.  I mean, I call in all the time, and I talk to him just on the phone.  Yeah.  I can imagine what these tapes are going to be like.  If you don't mind, I want to hang on the air and just listen to this because this has  got to be probably the funniest thing I'm ever going to hear in my entire life.  All right.  I'll put you on hold, and we'll go to you from time to time with your comments as well,  okay?  Right on.  Thanks, son.  All right.  Who else is...  Do we have someone screening the call?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:44:00]  Here we go, Anthony.  All right.  So I guess we could get into Spaz's audition tape.  Well, let's get right into it.  This tape was made when, Spaz?  Over the weekend?  Over the weekend.  Yeah, over the weekend.  Because he's talking about some current events in this tape.  He's talking about Khalid Muhammad's Million Youth March.  Yeah.  He's talking about the Killer Mosquito.  Yeah, don't get confused.  This isn't a tape from years ago or something at a college radio station or anything.  This is just this weekend.  Right.  A couple days ago, he's talking about the Subway series a little bit, kind of.  All right.  A little baseball talk. 
[01:44:30]  I'm not going to have a dog right there.  You better watch it, Michael.  And he has some comments about Hillary Clinton.  Mm-hmm.  Politics.  Good.  Well-rounded.  Well-rounded.  And Janet Reno out of nowhere.  All right.  So we're going to play the first break, Spaz.  All right.  This is you opening up your radio show, right?  Yes.  Okay.  What were you trying to get across in your first break here?  I don't know.  We're just going to go through the process with you.  That's all.  All right.  I wanted to start off with a voiceover to show I can do a voiceover.  Okay.  Voiceover.  Intro to music, you know, and hype up the show, what you can expect in the hour. 
[01:45:00]  Okay.  Coming up and everything like that.  Holy Jesus Christ.  All right.  So it's kind of like a radio tease, you know.  I'm K-Dog.  It's...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  By the way, his name is not Kevin or Spaz on his radio show.  It is...  K-Dog.  K-Dog.  K-Dog.  Look how he says that with a tarot.  So over a long, I think it's a Metallica intro, you're going to tell everyone what  they can expect on the K-Dog radio show, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Let's start here then.  Yeah, I'm kicking it off here at about four o'clock in the afternoon here on this Friday 
[01:45:30]  or Saturday.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Uh-oh.  You didn't know what day you were on?  I screwed up in the beginning.  So I...  But I covered it very well in the next statement.  What?  Or Saturday?  I'm sorry?  No.  The next statement I said, I'm just...  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to get into the weekend like everybody else.  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  So you were a little confused what day it was, right?  Yeah.  No real big deal if you're trying to be on the radio.  Sure. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I'm kicking it off here at about four o'clock in the afternoon here on this Friday  or Saturday.  I'm sorry.  Just trying to get...  Wait, wait.  What was that?  Everybody else's...  What?  Wait a minute.  What are you doing?  What?  It's like Friday or Saturday.  Do you hear that?  What?  He's got some kind of breathing thing going?  Dude, play that again.  All right.  Hold on.  This could take forever today.  Yeah, I'm kicking it off here at about four o'clock in the afternoon here on this Friday  or Saturday. 
[01:46:30]  I'm sorry.  Just trying to get into the weekend as everybody else is.  But...  What?  What is that?  You can't be snorting into the microphone like that.  It's phlegm.  It's when I'm breathing through my mouth.  That's what I...  That's the sound of me.  Well, you got to fix that.  Or something.  All right.  So the K-Dog radio show has begun, Anthony.  Yeah, how would I know?  Right.  That's their inexperience.  The K-Dog radio show has begun.  All right.  And so far, Spaz is not really sure what day it is. 
[01:47:00]  That's a good start, though, Spaz.  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  But we're going to kick it off the little program here with a little bit of Metallica.  And...  A few walks away from the...  A little bit here.  Good mic technique.  All right.  Anyway, yeah, we're going to be getting into the musical Rob Zombie and Manstein and other  good stuff.  We're going to be talking about some news going around.  There's a killer in the Speedo going around in Queens right now.  The Mets, the Yankees, and it's that Million Man Youth March. 
[01:47:30]  We'll see how it's going to be back to it.  Million Man Youth March?  What?  Million Man Youth March?  It's the Million Man March or the Million Youth March.  Remember both.  You can't be a man and a youth at the same time.  The Million Man Youth March?  I like that other part.  I know.  Wait.  I'm going back.  See the comments about, like, riots or something.  Hold on.  Here we go.  The Million Man Youth March.  Let's see how it's going to be back to it.  You can see the riots right now.  Anyway, as everybody fears for their life in Harlem, this is... 
[01:48:00]  Spaz is like bashing black people.  Right off the bat.  What's up with that?  I was trying to make it...  People are fearing for their lives?  You're wacky.  So they're fearing for their lives and they're like, what the hell?  I might as well tune in the K-Dog Radio Show?  Yeah, you know.  You're going to have to be a good connection with the story into the show.  All right.  All right.  Let me go back.  What? 
[01:48:30]  All right.  I didn't say anything.  All right.  Let's hear this again.  Get into that Million Man Youth March.  We'll see how good that goes.  And you'll see the riots right now.  Anyway, as everybody fears for the life,  I'm going to listen for the contest and giveaways later on here at WICR 610 AM.  We've got some t-shirts and other stuff like that.  Anyway, let's just continue on to music.  We're going to kick it off with Metallica.  Fade to black.  Here at WICR 610 AM on the college radio.  Call number 633-2369. 
[01:49:00]  Drop up a request.  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Go up to the studio.  This is K-Dog.  WICR 610 AM.  All right.  Let's get some listener reaction on the instant feedback.  I'll be Greg from Jersey.  He says, guys, this isn't even funny.  It's just sad.  And Ian from Syosset, please, I beg you, put the K-Dog to sleep.  What is your little catchphrase? 
[01:49:30]  Drop a dime?  I used to say, drop a dime, let me know what's on your mind.  Oh, that's cute.  Do you know what a phone call costs these days?  I know, but it's just catchy, I thought.  Someone else has a little critique.  I don't know how experienced this guy is in radio, but he's offering his critique.  Rich from New York City.  Get the tissues out of your nose.  You're not calling in sick to work.  Let's go to the phones real fast, Ant.  Frank, what's up? 
[01:50:00]  I'm going to drop a quarter.  Oh, my God, I almost crashed.  When is that million-man youth market?  I felt K-Dog, I felt like a dog.  My head was twisting when I hear a weird sound.  Oh, my.  What's going on?  Well, we're going to teach Spaz or K-Dog a little bit about radio today.  It sounded like he was snoring. 
[01:50:30]  I was asleep, too.  If I wasn't laughing, I would have been asleep.  All right, Frank, thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Can we go to some instant feedback real quick?  Steve from the Foundry Music website.  Okay.  As you know, Steve, wanting to get into broadcasting, he's going to school right now.  Yeah.  He says, God damn, I've been busting my ass on a demo for the past month, so I'll sound  perfect.  And that's what Kevin hands in.  Oh, my God, what a tragedy.  It's a rough draft.  Rough draft.  All right, calm down, everyone. 
[01:51:00]  Mike, what's up?  Hey, if you ask me, I think K-Dog is trying to audition to be Will Penn Tarvis on K-Rock  or something, because he's horrible.  All right.  ONA, you guys suck, Spaz.  You rusty trombone.  All right, thank you.  See you later.  All right.  So was that the end of your first break?  You set up your radio show there, Spaz?  The first break, yes.  All right.  Mind you, this whole tape was a rough draft.  Okay.  Oh, a rough draft.  By the way, I noticed throughout your radio audition that you were, like, recording your  segues.  Yes.  Oof.  Why? 
[01:51:30]  Because I wanted to...  Like, one song would fade out, and then I guess he's trying to show a future boss that he's  able to start another song as the other one's ending, right?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You don't need to put that on a tape.  I don't?  No, a monkey could do that.  Oh.  I mean, seriously.  All right.  Should we move on with his audition tape?  Oh, of course.  All right.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  All right.  Hey.  All right.  In all fairness for K-Dog, this is his second break of his radio audition tape, Anthony. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And he's coming out of Ugly Kid Joe's Neighbor, right?  Yes.  All right.  So he figured he'd work the song title into his rap to start this break.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  You're at, uh...  Come on!  WICR.  Wait a minute.  Did you forget what radio station you were at?  Did you?  No.  I just lost train of thought there for a second. 
[01:52:30]  The train of thought derailed many miles back.  Wait, Spaz.  All right.  You start your radio show and you're not really sure what day of the week it is, right?  Yes.  Okay.  And now I'm hearing on this tape that you really weren't sure what radio station you were at.  Would it be a question?  Drop a dime.  Drop a dime.  What is that?  Say it again.  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  All right.  Here he comes to start his second break with that neighbor thing. 
[01:53:00]  And listen closely.  Spaz kind of forgot what radio station he's broadcasting for.  Drop a nickel.  Suck my pickle.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  You're at WSCR.  Dude, it's like four and a half seconds.  I just timed it.  It's like four and a half seconds.  You didn't know your call letter?  Did you have to look up and read it from somewhere or what?  Is that manipulated? 
[01:53:30]  That's not manipulated.  That's how you gave me the tape.  Serious?  Yeah, look.  Listen.  Listen for yourself.  If you don't know what radio station you're broadcasting for.  I almost said N-E-W.  Oh, he's dreaming now.  Jesus.  All right, listen.  You're at WSCR.  It's like you're at W-I. 
[01:54:00]  That whole thing.  All right.  It's the K-Dog.  All right, so you had a little trouble trying to remember what radio station you're at.  I guess that happens with all the pros in the biz.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Let's move on with the second break here.  All right.  610 AM out of college radio for number 633-2369. 
[01:54:30]  That was Ugly Kid Joe with Neighbor.  And before that, you heard Fear Factory with their new single cars.  As well as we opened up the show with Metallica.  Yes, there is none higher.  With Fade Black.  Anyway, we're going to be getting some more news later on.  We're going to talk about that deadly mosquito going around in Queens.  What's the deadly mosquito?  Is it like as big as Godzilla that's attacking people?  It killed a couple of people.  You make it sound like it's this huge, like, 20-foot creature. 
[01:55:00]  Well, it's the deadly mosquito.  I'm trying to make the story so people would listen to me.  So this is a radio tease?  They're going to have to tune in to make sure it's not a huge, giant mosquito?  Yes, because I'm trying to give them a headline.  It captured my audience.  Oh, is that it?  Like the tease?  Yes.  Okay.  Wow, the instant feedback just going wild, Opie.  Yeah.  Paul from Morristown, he sounds like he smoked a dime bag before making the tape.  Someone tells Spaz it's okay to go back, listen to his tape before he hands it to anyone. 
[01:55:30]  Then he should ask himself if he would hire the person on the tape.  Get Mr. Rogers off the friggin' air.  Donald in the Bronx says, I'm going to drop a grenade.  This is more painful than watching Ben Stiller get his schween caught in a zipper.  And Xavier, good God in heaven, make this hurting stop.  Make it stop.  Ah, it burns my ears.  Get this effin' sorry ass off the air. 
[01:56:00]  Mennon from Brooklyn, I'd rather wear a Cleveland steamer than hear the rest of this.  Greg in Jersey, guys, please tell me that this is a bit and he didn't really do this on his own.  So the feedback's just pouring in.  Billy, what's up?  Hey, guys, how are you?  All right.  What the hell?  What is it?  One giant mosquito?  That's what I was trying to tell him.  Like Rodan flying around Queens somewhere?  Yeah, it's doing a flyby, for God's sake. 
[01:56:30]  The giant mosquito, that's killing people in Queens.  Come on.  It's killing three people.  Hey, this is Don Imus.  This is annoying me because I had Moby Worm, the giant worm.  Remember that, baby?  Hey, on a Spaz, am I experienced enough to critique your tape?  Yeah, yeah.  Just wait when he tries to pronounce what the people are getting from the giant mosquito.  Spaz, I think you need a big, fag cowboy hat like Don Imus.  Now, let's say it. 
[01:57:00]  W-A-M-B-Z.  All right.  All right.  So I guess Spaz is teasing a new story to keep his listeners tuned, right, Anthony?  I think...  So I guess he's going to have commentary on the giant mosquito soon.  Me and Rick are going to pee ourselves in the middle. 
[01:57:30]  Come on.  It gets much better.  Oh, I know.  Because this is Spaz's news break.  Hold on to your bladder, kids.  Okay, so there's a huge giant mosquito loose in Queens, and we continue the date now.  Does it have, like, fangs and stuff, Spaz?  It's right in Astoria right now.  It's a big, giant mosquito.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's move on.  Flying over LaGuardia.  Let's move on with the tape. 
[01:58:00]  If you're just tuning in, we're listening to Spaz's radio audition tape.  Just wait until he talks about the Million Years March.  If he said LaGuardia, we call it Laguardia.  All right, here we go, Ant.  Let's move on.  I'm not going to even get it to Hillary.  I don't want to discuss that.  Well, I can't get my views over the air because it's not meant for on the air. 
[01:58:30]  But, yeah.  All right, so you went from...  Okay, so this is, like, your current event...  What the hell is that?  This is your current event break, I'm assuming.  You want to discuss the issues of the day, right?  Yeah.  So you're teasing the giant mosquito story that you're going to talk about a little later, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  But now you have some commentary about Hillary Clinton, but it's so outrageous you're not going to tell your listeners, right?  Yeah, okay, no, man. 
[01:59:00]  You had commentary on Hillary, but it's not for the air.  Yeah, because I didn't know if I was allowed to say that.  Say what I was going to say.  What were you going to say?  Well, unless you were going to call her a c**t.  I don't...  I'm sorry.  All right, we had to dump out of the show.  Unless you were going to say something bad about her, bad language or anything, what were you going to say?  What were you going to say about Hillary?  You got some obvious strong views on Hillary.  Yeah, I was going to say is that she's a carpet muncher and she shouldn't be in New York because she doesn't know anything about it. 
[01:59:30]  Whoa!  Whoa, carpet muncher!  This is K-Dog's train wreck.  So you're pretty much telling people that she's a lesbian?  Well, yeah, because she's a butch.  She's been the president for the past two terms.  She wore the pants in the family.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:00:00]  All right, so I guess what I'm getting from K-Dog's radio audition tape, there's a killer mosquito loose in Queens and Hillary Clinton is a carpet muncher, right?  God damn, I would listen to this every day.  I swear to God.  I swear to you, if this was on every day, I would listen.  K-Rock ought to hire you.  I swear I would listen every day.  You're definitely better than Stuttering John.  I don't know what the hell's going to happen.  That's not saying much, but okay, so giant mosquito, Hillary Clinton is a carpet muncher.  Let's continue.  Not a carpet bagger. 
[02:00:30]  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  He's getting away from politics.  All right, wait a minute.  Hold on, I've got to know the phone's really fast.  Chris, what's up?  I could do better than that, and I'm not in radio, and that's a challenge.  All right, Chris, thank you.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Listen, I tell you what, I just about peed myself sitting here for the last 10 minutes  on the line.  I've got to tell you, Anthony, I can understand why he didn't give you the tape to critique. 
[02:01:00]  You know, K-Dawg's vast experience in the music industry has led him to where we're at  right now.  I can just imagine where his career is headed to.  He's going to be beyond what you guys even imagined.  All right, Mike.  Take care, fellas.  All right, Jesus, can we have some more, um, well, some more emails coming in?  They're just coming in like crazy.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Johnny, um, thinks, uh, K-Dawg should spend more time licking his, uh, things.  Uh, good God in heaven, Spaz shouldn't even do commentary for the Special Olympics. 
[02:01:30]  Joe Lyons from Comedy Central checking in.  The Greaseman isn't as racist as Spaz.  Oh, that's right.  He had a comment about the Million Man Youth March.  The Million Man Youth March.  Yeah.  Uh, Johnny from Brooklyn.  What's wrong with Spaz?  His mother must have dropped him as a baby.  Uh, Corey, does Spaz have the ability to speak in complete sentences or have a complete  thought? 
[02:02:00]  What a tool.  And, Rich, uh, neither, neither is K-Dawg meant to be on the air.  Uh, maybe in the air when he jumps to his death after this critique.  So, uh, people just checking in like crazy K-Dawg.  Yeah, and if you're just tuning in once again, we're listening to Spaz, uh, a.k.a.  Uh, K-Dawg's, uh, uh, radio audition tape anthem.  Bad dog and a K-Dawg.  A-A-K-Dawg.  Spaz, uh, handing, uh, uh, me the, uh, audition tape on the way home last night. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  All right, so I guess we're in the middle of, uh, Spaz's current events break-in.  Right.  Giant mosquito Hillary Clinton.  Yeah, well, we just found out that Hillary Clinton is a carpenter.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Are we going to go back now to, uh, Spaz Radio?  Spaz Radio.  From the top of the Spaz Building.  All right, ready?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Dan Arino getting some heat about the, uh, you know, the, uh, thing in Waco.  Yeah, that thing. 
[02:03:00]  That little distraction a couple years ago.  You also got some news on the, um.  Wait, you don't, you didn't, you didn't bring up Dan Arino, but you don't even.  Did you elaborate?  Did you elaborate on your thought?  Hold on, I got to go back again.  That thing in Waco.  Yeah, everybody knows what that was about.  Yeah, but catching some heat.  Why is she catching heat?  What new developments have we found out about what happened at Waco two years ago, or however many years ago it was?  It was an error, on my judgment, to not speak about that. 
[02:03:30]  Well, do you have any thoughts on, uh, Janet Arino and, uh, Waco, Texas, Spaz?  Uh, none at this moment, but I will get back to you.  Do you think the government's holding, uh, information from us?  Uh, no, but, um, I just think that Arino probably is getting a bad rap because I know how it feels.  Huh?  Go ahead.  Sorry, go ahead.  Because I, see, because I know how it feels, you know, when, when. 
[02:04:00]  All right, let him finish his thought.  Okay, he's got some, uh.  Finish his thought, come on.  It's a four-hour show.  Because I know how it feels when your own personnel and your own officers don't help you out.  They're, like, going against you.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  All right, so, and here's Spaz talking about Janet Arino, but he just decided to, uh, like Hillary, uh, he just wouldn't talk about it.  Janet Arino getting some heat about the, uh, you know, the, uh, thing in Waco a couple years ago.  He also got some news on the, um, the Mets and the Yankees and other such good stuff. 
[02:04:30]  The Million 90s march.  I should give my commentary on that pretty soon.  Anyway, you are listening to K-Dawg here at WICR.  And, uh, we're going to be getting back to more music in about a little bit.  But, uh, first we're going to get into a couple commercials and then we'll be right back with some more tunes.  I believe we'll be kicking off with some Judas Priest.  But, uh, so stay tuned.  Stay in there.  Any requests?  633-2369.  This is K-Dawg. 
[02:05:00]  Here at WICR.  610.  7 a.m.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  So he's, he's teasing the, uh, Million Man Youth.  March.  March.  He's going to have some comments about that.  A little comments about it.  Very.  I'm assuming this is going to be the bit of the day.  You've been, uh, pushing it so much.  It's got to be some brilliant stuff.  Spock.  I believe I did give good commentary.  All right.  Well, okay.  We're finished with the second break from the K-Dawg radio audition tape, Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  He covered a lot of current events there.  Yeah.  The people on instant feedback are great, man.  Lawrence, Brooklyn.  Give him the overnights.  The way overnights.  Uh, Marconi checking in.  I wish I never invented radio.  Another guy from Brooklyn saying, pathetic, just pathetic.  And, uh, Chris from, uh, Englewood.  Call the dog catcher on K-Dawg and stuff a bone up his ass. 
[02:06:00]  Well, um, let's go to the phones real fast.  Uh, Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you?  Listen, I've got one question.  Yeah.  The K and K door.  Yeah.  Is that short for Corky?  Thank you, Craig.  Totally out of control.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Rooney, New York City.  Uh, Waco is a current event.  In other news, Hitler, um, catching some, um, heat over that Holocaust thing. 
[02:06:30]  Uh, John, what's up?  Guys, this has got to be a scare, right?  I swear to God.  No way.  I used to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I thought you guys picked on him too much.  Spaz, you're an idiot.  I am going to be hacking up Flam from Flam and so on.  I swear it is, John.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's a rough draft.  Well, we understand that, Spaz.  That's why you came to us.  We're going to help you out with your next tape, all right?  Okay.  Tony from, uh, Milford. 
[02:07:00]  My wife is an Iona graduate.  She just threw away her diploma.  Thank you for proving Westchester Community College to be the premier higher learning institute.  Oh, the listeners are great, man.  All right.  Um, Spaz shouldn't be allowed to own a radio.  Uh, Tim, you've been waiting a while.  What's up?  Oh, guys, let me tell you.  This has been worth a half an hour away.  Oh, cool.  Spaz.  Yeah? 
[02:07:30]  I always used to call you, Kevin, when you pick up the phone, now you're effing Spaz.  You know what he sounds like?  Huh?  You take a .45, and you put it on 33 and a third.  Hi, guys.  Like the mad scientist in a Bugs Bunny cartoon?  The ether?  Hello, rabbit.  Let me tell you.  Spaz, as a college graduate, oh, Jesus Christ.  God help my son.  All right, Tim.  Later, guys.  Bye.  All right.  The president of Iona College just threw himself on the tracks of Metro North and put Spaz in a traffic copter and shoot it down. 
[02:08:00]  And I hate to say this, but we definitely got to take another break.  We've been talking for like a half hour.  We got the second half of the Spaz radio audition tape.  I defy you to go anywhere.  Who the hell is going to change their dial at this point?  On the way, his commentary on the Million Youth March.  And the giant mosquito.  The giant mosquito.  It's one giant mosquito killing people in Queens, according to Spaz. 
[02:08:30]  And he's got some tips on how to prevent getting bit by the giant mosquito.  Oh, there he is.  Whoa, there he is in Astoria.  Wow.  Just shrugging up the van wife.  I've got to take a leak. 
[02:09:00]  I can't handle this, man.  All right, listen.  We've got to blow out some commercials.  Please stay right there.  We'll get into the second half of K-Dawg's audition tape to become a radio DJ.  I swear to God, if there's program directors from other radio stations listening, you're  crazy not to hire this guy.  I can pick him up in a second.  Hire him, put him up against us, and see what happens.  All right, Ant?  All right.  Please don't go anywhere.  His commentary on the Million Man Youth March is priceless. 
[02:09:30]  And wait until you hear how he pronounces what you get from the giant mosquito.  More to come with WNW.  Stay there.  Don't even try to figure it out.  Just go along with it.  What happened?  102.7.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to learn in hell. 
[02:10:00]  O.P.S.  102.7.  All righty.  Spaz.  You all right?  I told you, man.  Spaz Radio.  It's not a show.  It's a freaking event.  We're going to continue on.  We've still got two more segments of Spaz Radio coming up.  So sit back, relax, enjoy.  If you're not going to be listening tomorrow, then I'll say Happy New Year right now.  And remember, the guys, we'll be back fresh, ready to rock, come this Monday, January the 3rd. 
[02:10:30]  All righty?  So without further delay.  Let's get back to Spaz Radio.  Now, more of the worst of O.P. and Anthony on FM Talk at 102.7.  It's O.P. and Anthony, and Spaz is in the studio.  We're back from the long commercial break.  Thanks for hanging in there for us.  I had to run out of here and take the wins.  If you're just tuning in, we're in the middle of listening to Spaz's radio audition tape. 
[02:11:00]  He gave us the tape on the way out last night.  Yeah.  Anthony and I, we decided, we were really scared to play it.  We finally decided to play it when we were stuck in horrible traffic on the 59th Street Bridge today.  We figured we needed a laugh, so we put in Spaz's audition tape.  I've got to say, thank God we were in traffic, that we weren't moving, because I swear I'd have been into the East River.  Yeah.  I'd have driven off the bridge.  Right.  We were laughing so freaking hard, we forgot we were in traffic. 
[02:11:30]  Should we maybe read a few emails commenting on K-Dog's audition tape opening?  Yeah, sure.  Go ahead, Ed.  All right.  Marianne, he sounds like special K-Dog.  Let's see.  Joe in Morristown.  Please, oh God, please don't let this moron breed.  Uh, Terry, the emergency broadcast system is funnier than Spaz's.  Pete in Hicksville, call the cops on K-Dog so they can put him in the trunk of a car and die. 
[02:12:00]  Another one, Spaz is worse than the Greaseman.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Matt in Ramsey, I guess doing a little imitation of K-Dog, hey, this is Crap Dog, I'm an absolute idiot.  And Matt from, uh, Manhattan, you should feed Spaz to the giant mosquito so it can suck the pus out of his head.  I want to stop listening, yet I'm deeply compelled.  I hope this doesn't cause a clot in my brain. 
[02:12:30]  John checking in, tell Ralph Mouth not to give up his gig at Arnold's.  Oh, man.  Hey, we're also getting some faxes in.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I can't handle it.  Remember, when you're breathing, you've got to go.  Um, Spaz, million men, Ute March, he sounds like Joe Pesci.  Ute March.  K-Dog has rabies. 
[02:13:00]  Does he lick his own, you know what, during the breaks?  I bet he can't even get himself off in a closet.  Does he sniff the asses of his guests when they enter the studio?  Thank you, Johnny.  Uh, tell gay dogs to give it up from Big John.  Sean in Jersey, uh, I think you finally found a worthy cause for all that muscular dystrophy money.  We have to have a cure for whatever Spaz has before it spreads.  He's sadder than any drooling kid in a wheelchair any day. 
[02:13:30]  Well, Spaz, people, um, commenting, but of course they're not experienced.  Right.  They really don't know what they're talking about, Spaz.  They're just listeners.  Yeah, take that for what it's worth.  Right.  Uh, Rick, what's up?  Hey, you guys better not let Dave Herman or Gary hear this tape,  because you guys will be losing your jobs real quick.  Oh, we know that.  And you should just tell Kevin you should go at the cops with a hammer in the near future.  Thanks a lot.  You guys suck.  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  Later.  All right, bye. 
[02:14:00]  Uh, Wiggler.  Wiggler.  Yeah, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  What's up?  He has got to change from K-Dog to K-Rap.  That's just horrible crap right there.  All right.  K-Rap.  I'll tell you that the Budweiser ferret is more articulate than Spaz.  We're here.  We're here.  All right.  Thank you, bud.  You suck at it, especially Spaz.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Uh, Stephen, what's up?  Yo, I think, yo, Spaz, everybody's busting on him, but yo, he's got balls.  He's got, he's, he's enjoying himself there.  There you go. 
[02:14:30]  He really is good.  All right, good.  Yo, I'd love to be in his shoes.  All right.  Ooh, hanging out with Spike, all them guys, you guys.  You guys are the best.  We love Spaz.  We're just giving him a little advice on his radio audition tape today.  Thank you, Stephen.  No problem.  All right, man.  One more call.  We'll get back to the audition tape.  James, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, he should either stick to changing tampons or doing gay plans or something  but just get him off the radio.  What is up with that?  Well, he's learning.  He's learning.  He's horrible. 
[02:15:00]  All right, James.  Spaz dogs.  What's K-Dogs?  Spaz dogs.  Sounds better.  All right, cool.  Later.  Thank you.  All right, are we ready to get back to the tape, Ant?  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  I want to refresh everyone's memory in case we're getting a bunch of new people checking  out the show today.  We are listening to Spaz, a.k.a.  K-Dog.  That's his on-air name.  And, yeah, it's his audition radio tape.  And so far, we learned on this tape that there's a giant mosquito killing people in Queens. 
[02:15:30]  A giant mosquito in Queens.  Don, I miss.  We also learned that Hillary Clinton is a carpet muncher.  Yeah.  I've heard in the news that she's a carpet bagger.  Yeah.  But, hey, carpet muncher, why not?  He had some comment about Jan Arino, but we're not really sure what it was.  And he's got, I guess the bit of the day is he's going to have some incredible commentary  on the Million Man Youth March.  Million Man Youth March.  Million Man Youth March.  But he's convinced that everyone was rioting in Harlem as they were listening to his radio show. 
[02:16:00]  Did I summarize good enough, man?  Yeah, I think you did a great job.  Okay.  Please forgive me.  Too much oxygen to my brain.  Okay.  From laughing too hard.  All right, so let's get back to the audition tape.  This is break three.  I think, finally, are we going to listen to your commentary on the Million Youth March?  Yes.  Million Man Youth March.  Million Man Youth March.  Okay, let's get back to K-Dog.  Yeah, run for your lives. 
[02:16:30]  Absolutely.  This is K-Dog here in the US.  Whoa.  All right, what happened there?  What happened there?  K-Dog?  Run for your lives, it's K-Dog.  I didn't know that the CD was going to continue.  I didn't know.  I don't know how to change the continuous single on that CD.  How did you handle that?  Let's hear how he handled that.  You want me to go back in?  All right.  I think he panicked.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[02:17:00]  All right, here we go.  All right, sorry about that.  Here we go.  Listen, he forgot to turn off the CD player.  Yeah, run for your lives.  This is K-Dog here in the US.  You are.  Whoa.  You got down there.  This is K-Dog here in the US at 16 a.m.  And Jeff Flanagan will be running to the Continental Airlines Arena as he was the 10th caller.  And he won those Black Sab tickets.  So Black Sab, that's pretty hip. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  All right, rock on, man.  Black Sab.  So congratulations, Mr. Jeff Flanagan.  All right.  Of dear old Iona.  Anyway, let's get some news that's going around today here on a Saturday.  All right, here comes some more news.  All right.  F-Tom broke off.  I mean, Spaz's news.  Oh, wait.  Dan, there's a guy on the line that says that he sees the giant mosquito.  Oh, he hung up. 
[02:18:00]  He hung up, bud.  Maybe he had a run from the giant mosquito end.  He'll call back, I'm sure.  All right, here we go with the K-Dog's audition.  Weekend Shipt here, WSR, 16 AM, phone number 623-2369.  Wait a minute.  Spaz.  K-Dog.  Pardon me.  Excuse me.  I meant no disrespect.  Shouldn't, if you're giving out, whether it be the calls of the station or the phone number,  shouldn't you be articulate? 
[02:18:30]  Shouldn't you let the people hear it?  You're kind of rambling.  Hey, K-Dog.  Like, you can't even tell what that was.  Play that little part back and you can tell me if you can say what that is.  All right, here we go.  Doing the Weekend Shipt here, WSR, 16 AM, phone number 623-2369.  Like, everything just blends into a...  It's just because I'm used to saying it.  But, hey, oh, my.  Adam, what's up?  What's happening, guys? 
[02:19:00]  Hey.  Well, I was wondering, I know where K-Dog got his name.  You've been watching too much wrestling, Spaz.  I was wondering where Conan from WCW went.  I was wondering next if you're going to be using Spaz Hogan.  No.  Wait, you got your name from the next wrestling guy?  Are you a K-Dog wannabe?  No, it's not that.  He happens to have the same name.  I just picked that name out of the blue because I had another name which I didn't particularly like, so I...  Macho Man was already taken. 
[02:19:30]  No.  I had another name, but I didn't want it anymore, so I chose that.  What?  Howard Stern?  No.  The name I had before K-Dog was Dr. K.  Dr. K?  Yeah.  The doctor is in.  Yeah, baby.  K-Dog.  He's got your prescription.  The K-Dog, Jesse James.  Oh, you didn't know?  All right, hold on.  John has a comment.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Listen, I just wanted to tell you, that tape would sound better if you played it backwards. 
[02:20:00]  Demonic messages.  Thank you, John.  All right, let's get back to the tape because this is another current events break.  All right.  Why are you turning so red over there, Spaz?  You all right?  Yeah.  All right.  My head hurts.  All right, here we go.  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Do you want to show me what?  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  And I'm looking here at the article that the Million Man Youth March, and it's been a  million...  Now, if you're looking at the article, can't you see it just says the Million Youth March?  There was the Million Man March, which was down in D.C. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  And then there's the Million Youth March, which is up in Harlem.  Yeah.  See, if you're a man, you can't be a youth.  Right.  Or a youth.  That's what I said, or what did you say?  Okay.  Million Man Youth Woman March.  Do you name me?  All right.  It happens.  All right.  It happens time and time again.  Million Man Youth March, and there's been a million prayers being said for peace as  Mohammed Khalid.  Mohammed Khalid will be marching.  Oh, no.  He's marching.  He's marching.  Oh, no.  He's marching.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  You could say Mohammed, uh, Kama Khalid. 
[02:21:00]  Or his name, Khalid Mohammed.  Oh.  Oh.  See, you kind of got his name backwards.  There, dog K.  Okay.  Okay.  My apologies to Mohammed Khalid.  All right.  See, you're really not sure what his name is, right?  I did read the article before I did this.  Well, didn't you see his name?  Yeah.  I thought I read it as Mohammed Khalid.  What do you have, a listexia?  There might have been a comment there. 
[02:21:30]  I just didn't see it.  All right.  Let's go.  I don't think so in the newspaper.  All right.  Let's move on.  This is his commentary about the Million Man Youth March.  You read it in the minute.  Uh, Mohammed Khalid will be marching.  Actually, he's marching right around now.  And, uh, last year was only about 6,000 marchers.  This year, it's going to be, well, according to him, slightly more.  He was, uh, went through two courts, actually, to get this okayed as the city tried to shut  the rally down because of Khalid's, um, racist remarks. 
[02:22:00]  In my opinion, I think that it shouldn't happen, but my opinion doesn't apparently count.  I'm just one of the masses here in the city of New York.  Masses?  So why don't you think, uh, the Million Man Youth March shouldn't take place?  Yeah.  Because the guy is a racist joke.  Why should people follow his message?  You mean racist?  Like, did he say anything like they'd be rioting up and all?  No, it's just, no, it's just a...  All right.  Yadda-dadda, I have to agree with him.  The grease man likes the K-Dog. 
[02:22:30]  Yay.  The color's a problem, a problem.  Snorlin's right, K-Dog.  It's the grease man with the K-Dog.  What a doodle.  Yadda-deedle.  What a doodle-deedle-do.  I'm not...  Yeah, we hate the colors, don't we, K-Dog?  Yeah.  It's K-K-K-Dog.  What a doodle.  Look at his hood.  What a doodle.  What a doodle.  Snorlin's bone dry.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Grease man with the K-K-K-Dog.  Yeah.  What a doodle.  Yeah.  Me and the K-K-K-Dog, we don't like the Jews either.  And the chinksy.  What a doodle.  I am not racist.  So you don't agree with...  Neither am I, yeah.  So you don't agree with Mohammed Khalid's message of hate or...  Hate and violence.  I don't believe...  Hate and violence.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  That's good.  Okay, here we go.  Anyway, we had a marshmallow with me happening and...  We had a marshmallow with me happening and...  Yeah, we did.  Oh, my head.  And you got more instant feedback over there.  There we go.  Punch it up.  Holy Christ.  It is...  Oh, my God.  It is priceless, man.  Um, Eric, what's up? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, listen, um...  Did WNEW hire Spaz strictly for entertainment purposes?  Or...  Or did they actually think that he could intern for this...  For this radio station?  The only great justice that could be done is if the giant mosquito flies up his ass and explodes.  He is absolutely horrible.  I'm embarrassed to be a communications major listening to this, guys.  I can't believe how bad this guy is.  Oh, all right.  Thank you, Eric. 
[02:24:30]  Thank you very much.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Rob from Brooklyn checking in, Opie.  In other news, the giant mosquito ate Mohamed Khalid while K-Dog made a mess on Hillary's munched carpet.  Kim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you, I mean, I had more fun yesterday when you guys were making fun of Jerry Lewis and the organization.  You know what I'm saying?  If you don't find this funny, then you really got to go find another radio station because this is top shelf stuff.  Top shelf.  He's boring. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Anyway, let's get back to the tape.  Chris, real quick, saying, Spaz really shines when he reads from the newspaper.  And I guess he breaks up his stories by using the term anyway.  Here we go.  Anyway, but yet much will be happening.  It is happening right about now.  I don't know how it's going.  And the police did promise to, well, be in less amount of force this year, basically.  What it is is that they're going to have 1,500 less officers there to close down the rally this year. 
[02:25:30]  There's going to be no riot gear, no helicopters swooping in to tear up the place.  And the cops tore up the place last year?  Is that what they did?  You might as well just tell the people that the cops are going to keep their fire hoses at home.  I was looking for a phrase to say, and that's the first thing that came to mind.  All right.  Let's move on.  Yeah, that's basically it.  So I hope the courts are happy, and it'll be their fault if something happens. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that's what I say, yeah.  It's bound to be bad if there's black people there.  Yada doodle, the grease man here with the KKK dog.  So it's a court's fault?  Are you an American?  Are you from this country?  I can't believe you're more defensive than the grease man.  Do you understand they do have the right to have this march? 
[02:26:30]  Yes, but it is American.  Most people don't agree that he had the march, but it's up to the courts to defend that.  Right.  Well, it's called freedom of the speech, you idiot.  I know, but Giuliani thought it.  All I'm saying is that if they promote hate and violence, and that's what happened last year.  I want to promote hate and violence.  I don't want anyone else promoting it.  No, why would the court allow history to repeat itself?  Yada do.  I agree.  I agree, yeah. 
[02:27:00]  If it's brown, keep them down, yeah.  That's what the grease man says.  And the KKK dog, yeah.  All right.  Are we almost done with your commentary?  About giant.  Million man youth march fast.  That's the end of the...  Now we go for the mosquito.  Oh, the giant mosquito.  Oh, you're going for the giant mosquito.  Hold your hats, people.  That's just my opinion.  If anybody wants to call me up at 633-2369, or if future's opinion, I'd be happy to...  I'm going to kick your white ass, mama.  I'm going to kick your white ass. 
[02:27:30]  I didn't mean it for all blacks.  I just meant people who follow his message.  Here he goes with his shovel.  Digging deeper.  All right, very good.  I mean all blacks.  All right, we got to...  I'm friends with a lot of them.  We got to get some...  A lot of them.  A lot of them.  I like those people.  I'm friends with those human beings.  Hey, don't you know you?  How do I phrase it?  I'm not a racist, but...  I'm not.  All right, I got a hint for you. 
[02:28:00]  Apologitory.  Apologitory.  All right, let's move on with the giant mosquito, I believe, is next.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we got a mosquito going around killing people.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, giant mosquito seen crossing the Triborough Bridge.  Oh, giant mosquito.  You're convinced that's one mosquito and they're trying to find this one mosquito. 
[02:28:30]  No, what I meant was there's a bunch of mosquitoes under one breed.  So, a mosquito breed.  What?  Next thing you know, he's going to say there's a bunch of chinks running away.  Could you name all the different mosquito breeds?  Yeah.  I know, I can look at pictures of them and...  Yeah, pictures are good.  I like a picture.  Whoa.  He has the centerfold.  All right, listen.  Field and stream.  All right, listen, this gets really good. 
[02:29:00]  I'm going to have to, let's let the tape ride.  All right.  Here we go.  Holy crap.  The giant mosquito in Queens, killing people.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing people.  Apparently, it affects your immune system and your brain.  It inflates.  It's called...  I can't even pronounce this.  Here it goes.  Encephalita.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  It's Homer Simpson, everyone. 
[02:29:30]  Did you figure out how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it.  Try again.  I need the word in front of me to pronounce it.  All right, someone give him the word.  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  Dude, I was laughing so hard, I just started dry heaving.  Giant mosquito.  Are you?  Yeah.  Giant mosquito. 
[02:30:00]  Look for the giant mosquito story.  Let's see what.  What's the same?  Rick, eagerly looking for the giant mosquito story.  I can't even pronounce this.  Encephalita.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  All right, I got it.  All right, you got the word in front of me.  All right, go ahead.  Spaz has the word in front of him.  Third death feared from Encephalitis.  That's my sister's name.  Encephalitis, you'll get your eyes over here. 
[02:30:30]  Your sister's spatula and the bone, it's inside.  Encephalitis.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You know, I was driving home down the southern state, and, you know, I saw the big mosquito  behind me.  I got really scared.  I sped up, but he came up alongside me, and he just wowed me.  I couldn't believe it.  He had a big KKK dog t-shirt on.  I was trashed.  I couldn't believe it.  I was shocked. 
[02:31:00]  Very good.  That'll shock you.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  Encephalitis.  All right, let's get back into the giant mosquito story.  And it inflames the outer layer of your brain.  That's what happened.  The mosquito's carrying.  In severe cases, these are some of the symptoms you may get.  Severe headaches, muscle aches, high fever, stiff neck, disorientation.  Then you go into a coma, have a couple of tremors, a convulsion or two.  Then you're in paralysis, and then could die. 
[02:31:30]  That, coincidentally enough, the same thing that happens when I'm listening to Kate, Bill.  You sure you didn't get bit by this mosquito?  Scott Herman's in here, our boss.  Scott, have you been listening to the audition tape of K-Dog?  No, I didn't.  Oh, you're missing all the fun today.  Can I hear it?  I'm a little scared to play it for you, because we want our jobs. 
[02:32:00]  We don't want you taking K-Dog and putting him in our time slot.  I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  All right, let's get back to the tape.  These are the symptoms that people infected have been showing.  And so, all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  The residents are being sprayed?  The residents are being sprayed?  What?  They're spraying like sumps and stagnant pools of water and brush. 
[02:32:30]  Not the people.  Damn you!  It's a mad house!  So you think they're just running around with this spray and spraying people as they're going about their business?  Super soakers full of DDT.  No, there were tables set up with officers in, like, that, you know, outbreak suit, and they had, like, cutter and off.  They were just spraying people as they walked by the table.  That's the picture I saw.  Oh, my God.  If I just, like, if I just, like, cracked his head open right now, would I be charged with anything? 
[02:33:00]  Or would it be a public service?  This is scary.  It's frightening.  It's just a joke.  And so, all throughout...  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  All right, hold on.  Let's get back to it.  And so, all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Actually, there are ways to prevent yourself from getting hit with this mosquito in Queens.  Hit with this mosquito!  There, he tried to say... 
[02:33:30]  What's the word?  Encephalitis.  It's like you're from a little country, you know?  I'm going to pee myself, I swear to God.  Encephalitis, where's Bactine?  Where's your sister Bactine?  It's still a giant mosquito at this point, Ant.  Yes.  One large, giant mosquito.  Thank God they're spraying the residents of Queens.  Just walking around with bug spray.  Spraying the residents. 
[02:34:00]  In Queens, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks.  When outdoors, use insect repellent.  That includes DEET.  D-E-E-T.  Avoid outdoor activity from dusting the door.  Remove water from cars and jars, because that's where miscues later eggs and, you know,  settled water.  And check your home for tight-fitting screens and doors.  Much like the rules of going out there in the summer, you know, don't wear heavy clothing,  don't run 100-degree heat. 
[02:34:30]  This is common sense, people.  Follow it.  Wait a minute.  You're telling people to follow common sense?  I am stiff-ified, man.  What?  It's common sense, people.  Follow it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's move on here. 
[02:35:00]  I think people should know these things anyway, but, of course, we've got morons on the TV  and, like me, on the radio right now.  That's true.  I'm telling you all the preventing causes to do.  Anyway, we're going to get right back to music.  And we take it off.  Actually, it would have been a Ren Strongstein.  It was Duhast.  Yeah.  Anyway, we've got some more news along the way.  We're going to talk sports after this next song break.  There's Duhast.  They're at WICR. 
[02:35:30]  It would have been great.  New rap.  That was good.  I hit the note.  You know, I hit the post.  That's a nice segue from Encephalitis.  Encephalitis.  Ricky, what's going on?  What's up?  Yeah, I just saw this giant mosquito.  He made his way up to Harlem.  He was giving Muhammad Khalid a rusty trombone, man.  I tell you, it was the weirdest looking thing. 
[02:36:00]  This guy's just a dope, man.  Get him off.  Actually, no, he's hysterical, man.  This is great.  Keep it up, guys.  All right, Ricky.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Patrick, Mount Vernon, saying,  Those infected can get a slight case of death.  Well, Ann, we do have more.  Oh, I can't wait to hear more.  Come on.  Do you want a few more?  Got to hear a little more.  We have a sports break. 
[02:36:30]  Yes.  Sports.  Come on.  Well, that's maybe where his strength comes in.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony.  I'm sweating.  I've been laughing so hard.  I started dry heaving.  I haven't laughed that hard in years, K-Dawg.  Thank you.  People saying, stop.  I can't see.  I'm laughing so hard.  Please, please stop.  All right.  I think we'll play one last bit of K-Dawg's radio audition tape after these. 
[02:37:00]  All right, Ann?  All right.  It's 1027-W-N-E-W.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, turn a cent to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  O.P. at the Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  1027.  This.  O.P. at the Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio. 
[02:37:30]  The 1027 is a program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello.  Welcome to Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags, or as we call them in America, cigarettes.  Let's not waste any time.  Let's bring out Bob the Fag Man.  Bob, welcome to the show.  I'm happy to be here.  Now, what's the topic today, Bob?  The topic is repairing a torn or ripped fag.  Right.  Now, a lot of people would just take the fag from, you know, being torn and just toss it right in the rubbish, right?  Right.  No, it's a terrible thing to do. 
[02:38:00]  You never want to waste a fag.  So what's the best method?  Well, for example, I've brought a fag with me today.  Right.  This is a perforated butt.  Right.  The fag's butthole is torn, and you want to repair that.  So what you want to do is you want to lick and then pinch with your fingers.  So you get a lot of saliva around the butthole.  A lot of saliva.  You lick it and get it nice and wet.  And then you pinch.  You pinch together.  It looks like a rather easy method.  Oh, it's very easy.  And good enough to suck again.  Right.  Bob, what a wonderful show.  Thank you so much for the information.  Thank you very much, Bob. 
[02:38:30]  Join us again next time right here on TreadCore.  It's beyond moronic.  It's sub-moronic.  Opie and Anthony 1027.  All righty.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Doing the worst of today.  We're almost done with today, but we've still got some great stuff on the way, including some  Jay Moore and Louie Anderson.  We've got one more section of Spaz Radio, and I've got to just read off a couple of the 
[02:39:00]  instant feedbacks, which are just freaking hilarious.  Angelo from Yonkers says, K-Dog should be locked in a room with a Wolverine high on angel dust.  Sweet Jesus, please kill him now and do us all a favor.  Another one.  Howie from Freehold.  Spaz, two words for you.  Special Olympics.  Let's see.  I think I've got one more.  I'll tell you what's on my...  Let's see.  A-Dog.  This is A-Dog from Yonkers.  I'll tell you what's on my mind. 
[02:39:30]  Spaz should be dropped from the top of a 12-story building.  Please kill him now.  Is everybody looking to put Spaz out of his misery?  But, man, this is some funny stuff.  I told you it was.  And without further ado, let's get to the worst of Opie and Anthony, the third and final installment,  thank God, of Spaz Radio.  Check it out.  You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:40:00]  On FM Talk at 1027.  1027, WNAW.  It's Opie and Anthony and K-Dog in the studio.  We're thrilled to have K-Dog here with us.  You might know him as Spaz.  We've been going through his radio audition tape here.  Yeah.  And I just can't get enough.  It's like an accident.  It is like a damn car wreck.  I can't get enough.  The people just speaking out in droves here.  Yeah.  I'll be instant feedback.  Joe from the Bronx. 
[02:40:30]  I guess has some advice for Spaz.  Welcome to McDonald's.  K-Dog here.  Drop a dime.  Let me know how I can help you.  And Jimbo from this concert, I'm going to stab myself in the ears with a sewing needle.  And then somebody else, I guess, wondering what you meant about what breed of mosquito is spreading.  What's the disease? 
[02:41:00]  Let me get the word out.  Encephalitis.  Oh, that was close.  Encephalitis.  There you go.  Encephalitis, litus, whatever.  I said, breed of mosquito.  What's he talking about?  What breed of Down syndrome does he have?  I have terminal depression and I'm laughing my ass off.  I feel better for myself because life could be worse.  I could be Spaz.  Jeremy.  Michael from Glendale, Queens on the instant feedback.  My cab driver, Mohamed Mobik Jambu Minko Gertisman, didn't charge me for the ride because he was laughing so hard. 
[02:41:30]  He can't believe how bad K-Dog speaks.  Well, there you go.  All right.  K-Dog.  I think we got the last part of his audition tape here.  Joe, what's going on real fast?  I got to tell you guys.  Yeah.  Listening to Spaz explain himself is even funnier than listening to the tape itself.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my Lord.  Spaz, you're an idiot.  You're just an idiot, bro.  Thank you.  No problem.  No, thank you. 
[02:42:00]  This disc has to go on your greatest head state, guys.  Yeah, watch out for that giant mosquito if you're in Queens.  Oh, got him.  Oh, definitely.  All right.  Got a big can of golf.  All right.  Good.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right, Ant.  I think we're moving into a sports break here.  He's coming out of music.  He's excited.  He's in the middle of his radio show.  And here we go with K-Dog's radio audition tape.  Yeah.  I am the super beast.  K-Dog.  You're on the WICR 670.  I'm out of college radio.  Pull the number 633-CD69 to CD. 
[02:42:30]  If you contact this, it's 69 for someone's lucky number every seven seconds according  to statistics.  What?  Oh, my God.  What were you trying to say there?  That's another catch coin phrase I had in college.  I said, hey, our last four.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  You have some of these wacky catchphrases.  What's the first one when you want someone to call you at your radio show?  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Okay. 
[02:43:00]  And what's your second one?  The other one is that the last four numbers of our station number is 2369.  So I say a CD69, a CD for compact disc, 69 for someone's lucky number every seven seconds  according to statistics.  Statistics.  Statistics.  I think you said statistics.  And what does that mean?  That somebody's in a 69 every 23 seconds?  No.  Every seven seconds, someone is falsibly having sex. 
[02:43:30]  So what does that have to do with 69?  69 is a sexual position.  Yeah, but does that mean that they're having a, like, everybody having sex is doing a 69?  They could be.  If they're lucky.  That's deep.  Uh, Rob, what's up?  Yeah, I just spotted, uh, you know, that giant mosquito flying over Flushing.  Hundreds of Japanese people are taking movies of it.  In fact, here comes Montra now. 
[02:44:00]  Montra's doing some skyline saying that Spaz is a jerk.  Uh-oh.  And now here comes Godzilla.  Oh, he's going in hell with spraying DDT out of his chest.  I can't believe it.  The people are going nuts.  Just playing one of those, uh, men that is walking around spraying people with bug spray.  You'll be okay.  Later.  Thanks, Rob.  Holy cow.  All right, let's go.  We've got to move on to other stuff on the show today.  We've wasted an hour and a half on this already. 
[02:44:30]  Statistics, I should say.  Anyway, I keep forgetting to turn that off every time I play it on that CD.  Station equipment.  Got to get it fixed.  Anyway, looking at the equipment.  Yeah, blame me.  Blame it.  Blame it.  And the Mets lost last night a heartbreaker in the 10th, 5-2 against the Rockies.  As the bullpen just blew it.  The Mets, like, actually last month were in first place in the Eastern Division of the National League.  But then that dwindled because Atlanta won a 10-game win streak. 
[02:45:00]  There's an F blow.  So then the Mets are stuck in four and a half.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that blows.  I've got to give it to him.  You've got to get a lot of credit.  You know, this sports, that blows.  I say that all the time.  Yeah, when my Giants lost, yeah, that blows.  Mets lost a heartbreaker in the National League baseball thing on the planet Earth. 
[02:45:30]  In our universe.  Well, you've got to get the little details out.  Yeah, right here in the northern hemisphere.  Of this great planet we call Earth and the solar system.  Right?  Spinning around the sun.  The Mets.  Lost one.  Well, K-Dog, I think you could team up with Mad Dog and you guys would have a great sports.  Mad Dog and a K-Dog. 
[02:46:00]  K-Dog and a Mad Dog.  Yeah, K-Dog, what do you think of the Yankees' chances here?  Going all the way.  I don't like the Yankees.  I don't like them either.  I like the Giants.  Boy, you're stupid.  I never knew there was somebody that couldn't speak a speech worse than me.  I can't even say to our router.  At least I can say encephalitis.  Encephalitis. 
[02:46:30]  It comes from a mosquito.  A bunch of mosquitoes.  Not a big, giant mosquito, you fucking idiot.  I got a K-Dog.  And now these words run to a router.  Encephalitis.  Ain't that right, Maggie?  I can't even speak.  I can say it. 
[02:47:00]  The idiot's got the words spelled out right in front of him.  One of the few diseases that are spelled phonetically.  No wonder I got so far in radio.  Mushmouth over here.  The idiot's got a gig.  Get a business.  They're probably some poor sap.  Somewhere in the Midwest.  Got a booming voice. 
[02:47:30]  Sounds like a testicle the size of hoppy hops.  Could be doing voiceover, making millions of dollars.  Never got a chance to go on the radio.  And we got a Swiss cheese head.  He's got a gig.  He's got a gig, Maggie.  The Mets losing is a heartbreaker.  It is just a heartbreaker. 
[02:48:00]  I'm ready to quit the business.  I'm going to become a speech therapist.  Might as well.  What the hell?  If this tool could be a DJ,  end up everybody.  I had the right dog.  I'm hanging out with the dogs.  Mad dog and K-Dog.  Mad dog and a K-Dog.  On the fan.  Can you remember that, the fan?  It's a K-Dog on the...  Hey, where the hell am I, that? 
[02:48:30]  Can you remember that, the fan?  It's a K-Dog on the...  Hey, where the hell am I, that?  Oh, yeah, the fan.  All right, we're in the middle of K-Dog's sports break here.  Mad dog...  What next, Martian soccer?  What are you going to comment on?  Something on this planet?  Or your home planet of Tatooine?  Where the hell are you from?  You're a freaking alien. 
[02:49:00]  It's got to be.  Can't be from Earth.  Let it on.  He's from the same planet that brings you the giant mosquito.  Giant mosquito!  It's a big swarm of mosquitoes, you freaking idiot!  It's like there's one mosquito with a derby and a cigar sticking out of his mouth.  Rousted people for change.  Mad dog, would you like... 
[02:49:30]  Him and his partner in Cephalinus, the black guy!  Mad dog, would you like to hang for this sports break?  No, I would like to listen to his sports expertise.  All right, here we go.  We got an expert in the studio to help you further along here, K-Dog, with your radio edition tape.  At the National League.  But then that dwindled because Atlanta won a 10-game win streak.  There's an F-blow.  The Mets are stuck at four and a half games behind as they play the Rockies tonight, actually. 
[02:50:00]  Our latter going against Bohannon.  And the Yankees lost.  Dropped one to the Angels, 8-2.  As Andy Pettit had a really tough season this year.  Captivating delivery!  So I don't really give a, you know, a rat's patoot.  He doesn't like the Yankees.  He's telling everyone he doesn't like the Yankees, Anthony.  I despise them.  But that's his strategy.  He figures he doesn't like the Yankees. 
[02:50:30]  So he's not going to let anybody hear about how the Yankees did.  So allow them out to sleep with his delivery.  But anyway, I hate the Yankees, so I don't really give a, you know, a rat's patoot.  A toot.  Against, you know, for the Yankees.  But my picks are still the Mets to win the Eastern Division.  For the Central, I would have to say Houston.  And for the West, I'm going with Arizona.  For the American League, I want Boston.  It's not going to happen.  But I'll pull for them anyway. 
[02:51:00]  Boston for the American League East.  Pull for them.  I'm going with the Central.  And I'm pulling for Oakland for the West.  And for the wild cards, I say National League.  Cincinnati will get it.  And I'm thinking that the American League, I'm going to have to say Texas.  So I'm going with the top.  Yankees and Braves are not going to make the pennant race.  Call it an outside limb.  I know people have not.  Call it an outside limb?  I accidentally used two phrases in the same juncture. 
[02:51:30]  What were you trying to say?  You're basically saying that the Yankees and Braves are not going to be in the playoffs, right?  I was going out on a limb.  Do you realize I'm going out on a limb and there's an outside chance?  That's what I was trying to say.  I thought you were going on a whim.  Oh, you could go on a whim.  Out on a whim.  I used two phrases at the same time.  I don't know.  All right, so the Yanks and Braves are not going to make the playoffs.  They realize there's only like three weeks left in the season,  and they're pretty much going to make the playoffs.  Lyricals do happen.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  I don't like the Braves.  Unfortunately, one didn't happen, right?  Yeah.  I know people knocking on the door, pounding on the door, saying,  what is up with you, K-Dog?  My friends, they've hit me over the head with papers and other crap  just because of the comments I made about the baseball situation.  That's what I'm saying.  There's nothing to do with baseball.  The Yankees and Braves will not make it to the penniless.  You know, the time is up, I think.  I think it's time for the Mets and the Indians to move on in the World Series.  Jesus.  Anyway, so that's the case with baseball. 
[02:52:30]  But as it stands now, some of my predictions are true, some of them are not,  but we'll see in season eight.  Anyway, Lady Liberty, they're getting behind in the WNBA playoffs,  and we'll see how that goes in the future.  But we've got one last song set, Spaz for Domus.  In the future.  He's making predictions at Spaz for Domus.  He's one of my quatrains.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  And we're going to kick it off with a little bit of Butthole Servers.  Total voice there in a second.  Anyway, we're going to be getting back to more music.  Here is the Butthole Servers.  Oh, there's...  Ooh.  Adding a little spice.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to have to be snacked downstairs with Peppa.  Here at WRC, 6 a.m., on the college radio, 643-2369. 
[02:53:30]  That was a hell of a sports break.  You've got to give them credit.  For a friggin' retard to even be able to say things like Yankees, Atlanta.  Hey, you've got to give them credit.  Obviously, he doesn't have a brain.  Obviously, there's nothing in there.  All right.  We have finally reached the last break of K-Dawg's radio show.  Here it is.  He's wrapping up his little show here.  Don't go away, man. 
[02:54:00]  Anyway, speaking of going away, it's K-Dawg, and it's about time for me to go back to the  kennel, so to speak.  You've got to turn off the CD player again.  Yeah.  As I go off to the kennel.  I like that.  Back to the kennel.  Back to the kennel.  That's cute.  Please have this dog destroyed.  Back to the gas chamber.  You should be euthanized.  Can't take it. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  Let's wrap this up.  Back to the kennel.  Anyway, it was Motley Crue with Don't Go Away Mad.  Before that was Offspring with The Kids Aren't Right.  That explains why I'm so screwed up in the head.  Anyway, up next is Hellspawn.  He'll keep up with his rock and metal format.  And as he'll play his favorite metal and rock tunes here on WICR 6 a.m.  And don't forget about our WICR big-ass bash one week from tonight, as a matter of fact. 
[02:55:00]  Kicking off at 8 p.m.  And Old Dool's just around the corner on, actually, on North Avenue.  Old Dool's on North Avenue.  615 North Avenue, the exact.  And we'll be having a party there all night long.  It's 21 to enter.  No, it's 18 to enter.  21 to drink.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, time for me to go.  Wait, did you say 21 to enter? 
[02:55:30]  18 to drink?  I almost said that.  Wait, I got 20 to drink.  Hold on a sec.  That's right.  Old Dool's on North Avenue.  615 North Avenue, to be exact.  And we'll be having a party there all night long.  It's 21 to enter.  No, it's 18 to enter.  21 to drink.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, time for me to go.  And, wow.  Anyway, I'll be back again one week from today.  Kick it off and get a 4 o'clock with more of your favorite tunes. 
[02:56:00]  Keep the requests rolling in at 633-2369, and I'll see you next week.  Here's my final song as I head out.  No pun intended.  Here's Guns N' Roses with Night Train.  Wait, wait.  Why would head out be a pun?  A pun with the song.  You know, I'm heading out on the night train. 
[02:56:30]  There he goes.  Heading out.  There goes K-Dog.  Back to the kettle.  On the night train.  Heading back to the kettle.  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  Somebody tell Spaz it's butthole surfers, not butthole servers.  Servers?  I mean, an ounce of pronunciation. 
[02:57:00]  You have an ounce of talent.  One ounce of talent.  Well, maybe.  Answer in the phone.  Maybe Spaz is a butthole server.  What do you mean, Josh?  You see, one guy likes your catchphrase.  Just drop a dime and Spaz a lenta from behind.  Frank, what's up?  Dude, how long was the umbilical cord wrapped around his throat?  God's sakes.  Lucky he made it, I guess.  Hey, and the Yanks and the Braves aren't going to make it to the pennant race. 
[02:57:30]  What are they in right now?  Come on.  They ain't going to make it.  They're not going to make it into the playoffs.  Yeah.  No, he said they're not going to make the pennant race.  Oh, exactly.  I screwed up, all right?  I'm at the playoffs.  Look at that.  Oh, he's just exhausted.  He's exhausted.  Ah, Jeff, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Thanks.  Yo, could you please neuter the K-Dogs so you can't breathe?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This is worse.  My IQ is through the f***ing floor.  I'm sitting here drooling over myself. 
[02:58:00]  I'm wearing my f***ing hockey helmet.  Oh, look, dude, you can't say the F-word.  You can't curse.  We had to dump out of you twice.  But we get your point.  Thank you.  Wow.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye.  See you.  Mike, what's up?  Where did he go to college, just kidding?  Iona.  Iona.  I mean, they're going to take his diploma away.  They tried.  I mean, if anybody's listening to this show, he's retarded.  I just don't get it.  You guys are the best. 
[02:58:30]  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Bye.  My God.  Oh, Christ.  Some guy wrote a whole news story about how the giant mosquito infiltrated the Million Man Youth March  while Mohammed Khalid was performing the Rusty Trombone on Reverend Al.  Oh, my God.  You make Stuttering John sound brilliant.  I swear to God.  Wow.  This is more disturbing than Robert De Niro's Rupert Pupkin character in a fake talk show 
[02:59:00]  in The King of Comedy.  Oh, that movie's great.  Andy, what's up?  Yeah, I actually have to thank Spaz.  Yeah.  He's inspired me to go back to school, and I'm going to go to Iona for a communications  degree, because if they can give him one, they'll give anybody one.  There you go.  And, you guys, you might as well quit after today, because you're never doing anything  funnier than this.  You have to thank Spaz for your best bit ever.  This could be the funniest stuff I've ever heard. 
[02:59:30]  Ever.  Thank you, Andy.  Take it easy, guys.  You're stuck.  Kevin from the Bronx.  That sports report by Spaz was the most back-ass, effing stupid attempt at sounding smart.  The Rangers have practically clinched for the playoffs, and there's no effing way the  Yanks or the Braves will not make the playoffs.  Shoot him.  Shoot him now.  Shoot him now.  I called the other day to critique your show. 
[03:00:00]  And Spaz said, what does critique mean?  Hey, idiot.  You don't know where the tampon goes on a woman?  The placenta?  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  What?  Oh, you're making a royal ass out of yourself.  I'm an idiot to do anything I want to do.  Yeah, the man and woman do it.  And then, uh, little squids fly up.  Squids.  It's the Spaz.  You can't be for real, man. 
[03:00:30]  Obi and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven.  Obi and Anthony.  Yeah, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  One, oh, two, seven.  Imagine Spaz with Tourette's.  And it shows dragging a little bit.  You know, I think it would be better maybe when you, because you started out strong and  everything, and it's like, but sometimes I like to beat the ass and it goes, but then I, you know, 
[03:01:00]  when the rest of us call, I'm like, jeez.  Jeez.  Yeah, I answer the phone calls all the time.  I try to put through the best calls for the show, because sometimes I'm like...  uh...

Yes, it is.  All right.  Show me.  Show me pudding.  Oh, sorry.  That's the wrong answer.  Show me Captain Crutch.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, you have a chance to steal.  Oh, sorry.  That hurt.  Can't kiss you anymore.  You're a mess.  Oh, man.  So, we're pretty proud of the fact that Louie Anderson did an ID for our show, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  That's where we were going with this.  Would you like to hear it now? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, let's hear the real Louie Anderson doing an ID for our show.  Oh, okay.  Hi, Louie Anderson, and whenever I'm in New York, I listen to my two favorite guys, Oofy  and Anthony, on FM Talk at 1027.  You're a liar.  What a liar.  And then what did he say right after he did it?  You've never met us.  So, I asked him, I asked him if he, I go, could you, could you ad-lib one?  He's like, no.  And he walks out.  Ad-lib.  I don't know how to ad-lib.  I'm like, could you ad-lib one?  No. 
[03:20:30]  No.  He walks out, and he's like, who are those two guys, Oofy?  I've never heard of them before.  You know, he's got set up next on the game, too, is when you hit the buzzer to try to answer  the question, it sends a food pellet down to him.  Yeah.  Boy, I could eat during the show.  Big, fat, bubble, 200 pounds of shoe, two bubblegum ass.  Uh, Bob, what's up?  I saw an episode the other day.  I started watching it.  It was kind of like, you know, when you drive past a car accident.  You got to look. 
[03:21:00]  He was just like, you just, you watch, you just see him getting fatter.  As the show went on.  He was just like, you know, he's asking the people what they do, and they're like, woman's  like, oh, I'm a gym teacher in high school.  He's like, oh, that was my favorite class.  Oh, another fat joke from Louie.  He's like, so stupid.  You got to, like, look at him when he looks up at the board.  He's like, show me pudding.  And you look up, and you just see his big, fat head.  He's just making these stupid expressions.  That's even worse when he has to look up, because then you see, like, a pelican neck  gullet thing going on. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, it was terrible.  Show me pudding.  Please, people, don't get too close to Louie.  My own gravitational pull from my mask can destroy you.  Suck families right into me.  Oh, it was terrible.  All right, Bob, thank you.  Thanks, man.  I am dying over here.  I'm Louie Anderson, and whenever I'm in New York, I listen to my two favorite guys.  Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. 
[03:22:00]  Show me pudding.  Oh, it's putting in my pants.  Oh, my God.  Hi, this is Louie Anderson, and whenever I'm in New York, I listen to my two favorite guys.  I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to be adding, I'm going to 
[03:22:30]  I'm pretty below you, man.  Hi, Louis Anderson.  Whenever I'm in New York, I listen to my... 
[03:23:00]  Two favorite guys.  That's on top of 1027.  Show me ass cheese!  I have trouble wiping my own butt  because my arms are too short to get around this fat body.  I'm almost like a Tyrannosaurus Rex with a little short arm.  It's kind of hard to wipe.  Let me pull down my pants and show you, Puddin'.  So, we want to thank Louis Anderson for the show ID for our show, Anthony. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, thanks, Louis.  You're a good pal of ours, too.  He's never heard of us?  Yeah.  He's never heard of our show?  Never heard of your abusive show.  Uh-oh.  No, I'll say it, man.  You want to save this one?  Yeah, we've got to save the Louis ID.  Save it for a goof?  Yeah.  You've got to card out the part where he says, you know, he doesn't want to ad-lib one for us. 
[03:24:00]  Because it is funny, in the background, you hear him just go, no, I don't want to do that.  No, I don't want to.  I can't.  I'll read this script, but I'm not going to...  Any time for brunch or dinner or lunch or breakfast or something?  I'll do it for a rib.  Oh, my God.  I feel my body starting to feed off of its own fat.  I haven't eaten in seconds.  Please.  Anything.  I need a claret.  Anything.  I'll take an Altoid.  Something I can chew with flavor. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm an eating machine.  Show me pudding.  Show me pudding.  Show me pudding.  Life with Louie.  All right, Ed.  Now, make sure you pick up my Life with Louie cartoon pasta in your supermarket canned pasta aisle.  Because that's what you want to feed your kids, isn't it?  That's what you want to feed your children is pasta with a picture of a big, fat guy that's probably going to drop dead at any given moment. 
[03:25:00]  That's a great thing to feed your child.  Yeah.  It's pasta shaped like my big, fat ass.  Yes, in a brown sauce.  Just the way you like to eat it.  Bob, what's up?  O&A.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Yo, man, you almost smashed up my car, man.  Why?  I'm drinking water listening to the bitch driving on the LIE.  All of a sudden I hear the Louie Anderson fart. 
[03:25:30]  Water spits out of my mouth.  There's no wipers on the inside of the car.  I'm like, holy sh**.  Right.  All right, I'm trying to wipe the window down driving.  People are looking at me laughing hard and at the same time trying to control the steering wheel.  What are you guys doing to me, man?  Anthony, in rare form today.  All right, Bob, thank you.  Glad you like that one.  Bye.  Listen to this, Ed.  You got the ID and then when you say AdLib?  It's right after it.  Okay, all right, all right.  Here we go.  Listen, so Mark asks him to do an ID for our show and he reads the stupid script and then 
[03:26:00]  Mark goes, could you AdLib one for the guys?  Want to AdLib one?  No.  All right.  Nah.  Nah, I've had enough.  Nah, I don't know.  Nah, it's too much work for me already.  I said like eight words and I haven't eaten a thing.  Want to AdLib one?  Nah.  All right.  I get it.  Nah.  Nah.  It sounded like you were a scumbag, man.  Mark, it sounded like he intimidated you.  What's wrong?  Thought he was going to take a bite at your arm or something?  Nah.  Fat and ugly.  What am I going to do? 
[03:26:30]  Thought he was going to gnaw at you?  Nighttime's when Louis Anderson comes cruising.  I know.  I know.  That'll be another 20 minutes.  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Little tender eyes and down you go.  Louis Anderson just keeps pounding and pounding.  Water turns red with blood.  But I thought that was Al Roker.  Looked up one morning, saw a PBY flying over.  That's when I was most scared. 
[03:27:00]  Thought Louis Anderson was coming for me.  Saw Louis Anderson eat a rocking chair once.  Louis Anderson can't go down with three barrels.  Eddie, what's up?  It's got to be 20 foot, maybe 25 with three tons.  I think I saw that episode.  15,000, I'll get you to hit beat the whole damn Louis Anderson.  Oh, man. 
[03:27:30]  Look, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Take a break.  I've got to eat.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, to be wild.  Boop, boop, boop.  More stupidity on the way.  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  1027.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. 
[03:28:00]  Hello, ma'am.  This is Lieutenant Colombo.  I've got a couple of questions to ask you.  Could you shove your fist up my...  I'd love it if you could just stick your fist up my...  Listen, get your husband over here.  We'll pop my eye out.  And he could skull f*** me.  Could you do that, please?  Just skull f*** me. 
[03:28:30]  I love that.  Mrs. Colombo, she pulls out a big...  Rips my eye out and just shoves that thing right to my brain.  I love it.  All right, thank you.  Hey, oh, oh, pardon me.  One more thing, ma'am.  One more.  Bury your boot up my...  Could you do that?  And could you just grab my...  And twist it like a pretzel?  I'd love if you grab my...  Grab my shriveled old Colombo...  And twist that thing like a pretzel. 
[03:29:00]  Okay, ma'am.  I've got to get back to the precinct now.  Oh, before I leave, one more thing.  Could you do, ma'am.  One more thing.  Push my...  Could you just clamp down on my...  And squeeze them till they come out of the hole in my head that used to have an eye.  Colombo, don't you have to go arrest Martin Landau.  Oh, I was in a series once with Martin Landau.  And after the show, after the shoot, as they call it, I jammed my fist so far up his... 
[03:29:30]  I actually pulled out his prostate.  It was wonderful.  We used to film at Universal Studios.  And we'd all get together in the commissary.  And pound each other with a little cake.  I can't say this. 
[03:30:00]  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of horses.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  One, two, seven.  All righty, what's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got about 20 minutes left.  I'm going to try and squeeze in as many quick bits and stuff as possible.  I'm almost tempted to replay old Bill asking for that little rascal.  God damn, I was in tears.  I almost couldn't hit the next button.  That has got to be the funniest one I've ever heard. 
[03:30:30]  What am I going to try and work in here?  You know what?  I'm just going to keep pulling CDs, throwing down bits until we basically run out of time.  All right?  That's the way it's going to work for the next 20 minutes.  So sit back, relax, enjoy.  Remember, tomorrow is going to be the last worst of the week.  Guys return in person, in studio, on Monday, January the 3rd.  All right?  If you're not going to be around tomorrow, happy new year.  In the meantime, let's get back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You deserve the best. 
[03:31:00]  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Well, Anthony, they had the African-American Pride Parade in Harlem.  Yes, they did.  A lot of marching bands, dancing girls.  Who was there?  Dinkins was there.  Charles Rangel.  And our own Reverend Al Sharpton was there.  It sounds like a great time.  They had cowboys, people riding horses.  Like I said, the bands and dancing were very festive. 
[03:31:30]  Fun time without any incident.  I was going to say, and absolutely no problems in Harlem yesterday.  Whoa!  I am outraged!  Reverend Al.  I am outraged.  I cannot believe it.  Did you read the paper?  Yeah, why are you outraged?  There was no incidents in Harlem yesterday.  Not one incident of police brutality.  Right.  I'm outraged at the police.  We have an African Pride weekend, and it goes off without a hitch. 
[03:32:00]  What?  I'm outraged at the lack of police brutality.  What?  Unless the police bust a cap into my constituency, how am I supposed to get my face on the TV?  I believe the racist police didn't shoot anyone because we are black.  And I saw some mighty, threatening-looking Negroes there.  Oh, come on.  The police didn't even shake a nightstick.  Come on.  Nothing.  What's wrong with the police? 
[03:32:30]  I got to eat.  What is the city coming to when a crowd of black people can celebrate pride of their race  in their own community with not one of them getting shot?  How am I going to buy me a new suit if I can't latch on to a grieving parent of an innocent victim?  I am truly Al Ray.  I want to organize a march from the Palo Deer to the police headquarters to protest the racially motivated non-shooting of our young brothers. 
[03:33:00]  Reverend Al's getting skinny.  I'm hungry.  Unless the cops start slinging lead, your Reverend Al ain't getting fed.  The police got to start pulling their guns to keep Reverend Al in sticky buns.  Come on, people.  You got to help me here.  I don't want to work.  Come on.  I'll die out there.  I'm hungry.  Please, you got to help me.  Please.  Oh, what was that?  Was that a backfire or a gunfire?  I'm out of rage.  Racism. 
[03:33:30]  God, please.  Make that a gunshot, please.  I'm starving over here.  If the police don't start to shoot, where the hell am I going to get a new suit?  I am out of rage.  All right, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al leaving the studio.  Very pissed off that there were no problems at the African-American Pride Parade in Harlem yesterday.  He is out of rage.  He's very out of rage, Anthony.  What's running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan? 
[03:34:00]  He's yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's sapping off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his head's full of grease.  You hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace. 
[03:34:30]  The man with a plan.  You know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an act just like a boss.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now, why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bernie gets in the brawly case?  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face. 
[03:35:00]  He's feeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for something for business to be.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's coming right.  I'm hungry. 
[03:35:30]  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now, as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He'll eat your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's a raised, made white, hate bag of baloney.  Now, why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal. 
[03:36:00]  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  The Talk You Can't Ignore.  All right.  It's FM Talk at 1027 Talk You Can't Ignore.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And in the studio with us today, Jay Moore.  Hey, Marco.  Yeah.  You're a gay guy?  Yeah.  And you're in love with Jay?  Oh, I love Jay so much.  Get down here right now.  I would watch your show action and pleasure myself two and three times.

You've got to figure out a way to start.  Do you work at a desk?  No, I work in a factory.  In a factory?  Well, you've got to find.  You've got to get that phone someplace where you can touch it, man. 
[03:37:30]  Well, I'm behind a desk right now.  Take out the hog, Marco.  Because what I'm going to do to you is going to rock your work.  Oh, baby.  Marco, my stomach is so ripped.  Oh, baby.  I love that.  You know the hip bones?  You get those diagonal lines that go down towards the cross.  I got that, too, man.  When your lower abs are really, really cut.  Yeah.  And I got, here's the topper of all toppers.  Two days ago, I shaved my cubes.  I'm not joking, Marco. 
[03:38:00]  These guys are laughing.  I do that, too.  I do it just so I don't pull my hair when I masturbate.  It's nice.  Seven and a half inches, Marco.  Oh, baby.  I knew it.  I knew you were that big.  I'm circumcised.  I got a pink fireman's cap on top.  Yeah.  I have very small testicles.  Not very small like a freak, but they're not like Donald s**t, you know?  Oh, baby.  And Marco, man, I tell you what.  Then tell me about that hole of love.  No, that I don't do it. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, now you're drawing a line, Jay?  I can only do oral with Marco.  All I can tell is...  Oh, baby, just let me put my s**t in there and you...  No, you can do that.  Definitely.  I'll let you do that.  I'll get a baby wipe.  I'll get it ready.  Unless you want to clean it yourself.  Oh, baby.  It's going to make you puke.  No, it won't.  Marco, it is clean.  I got baby wipes.  I use toilet paper and baby wipes every time.  Oh, man.  Because you never know when you're in the Hershey Highway when this s**t might break down.  Oh, God. 
[03:39:00]  That's right.  And Marco, when it's all done...  Yeah.  I'm going to make a map of Hawaii on your stomach.  Yeah.  It's going to be everywhere.  That's what I like.  It's going to spray like...  Like, I could break up...  I could break up an Al Sharpton march with what I'm spraying.  Oh, man.  When I s**t, I'll hit you on the forehead.  Come on, Marco.  Take it.  Is it that smart?  Are you touching yourself right now?  Uh-huh.  Come on.  Stroke it, man.  All right.  All right. 
[03:39:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you want me or not?  Oh, I want you so bad.  Stroke it.  Show me.  Show me.  Show me.  Come on, baby.  Show me.  All right.  You want to be gay?  Let's be gay.  You say you're such a fag and all?  Come on.  This is your shot, man.  You're going to get it.  You are going to get it.  You are so hot.  You are so bad.  Oh, you're so hot.  You're bad.  You're going to get it.  And if you don't take that out right now...  You know I want to get it to you.  Do it.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  You better finish.  You better finish.  I'll get it.  I'm pulling my pants up if you don't finish. 
[03:40:00]  I got mine out right now.  Anthony's attorney on the way.  Oh, man.  Do it, Marco.  If you don't...  Oh, I'm going to smack your ass.  Smack that tight ass you got.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it.  All over me, Marco.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Good.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[03:40:30]  Hold it.  Hold it.  We're going in.  Oh, my God.  Come back soon, Marco.  Oh, my God.  I never dumped out so much in my life on a radio show.  Bring it along.  Opie, you're kind of cute, too.  All right.  Bye, Marco.  Whore.  Whore.  You whore.  All right.  We had to hang up on Marco.  He better have been doing it.  If I find out he's faking, I'm going to the factory with all my gay friends, and we're 
[03:41:00]  going to kill him.  The music was the best part.  I actually got an erection just from the music.  Opie and Anthony, 102.7 Talk Radio.  Forget it.  Why listen to music?  You own the album.  What are you going to listen to?  Rock and roll.  You own that record.  Put it on 102.7.  It's a riot, baby.  It's a riot.  Opie, Anthony, 102.7.  Whee! 
[03:41:30]  Whee!  Hey, everybody.  It's me.  It's Rooster Rob.  And I'm here to tell you that just west of the Mason-Dixon, there's a place where everybody  goes and brings their cocks.  That's right.  It's Rooster Rob's Cockfighting City.  Banned in 48 states, Rooster Rob's is the cockfighting capital of the U.S. of A.  Where we cram the best in cockfighting every Friday and Saturday night.  We're talking big cocks, small cocks, cocks of every shape and size. 
[03:42:00]  We'll come on down and do battle in Rooster Rob's all-new cock ring of dance.  You'll see all the action live and in person.  We're talking kicking, screaming, blood.  It'll be flying everywhere at Rooster Rob's Cockfighting City.  So bring your cock, turn it loose, and find out who has the best cock every Friday and  Saturday night.  And Rooster Rob's ain't just cocks.  There's also great fun for the kids.  Just bring down the little ones and they can enjoy Uncle Dace's all-new pet zoo. 
[03:42:30]  So come on, come on, and grab your cock and head on down to Rooster Rob's Cockfighting City.  Whee!  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  I'm hearing there's a guy on the line that got very injured because of Hurricane Floyd.  Is that true?  Hello, FM Talk at 1027.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hello. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, we got you on the air.  What's going on?  The hurricane was awful.  Yeah, it sure was.  It was awful for a lot of people.  I was very hurt.  Yeah?  On the streets.  Well, what happened to you?  Well, the wind was blowing.  Right.  And I bent over to pick up my glasses that blew off my head.  Yeah.  And a Chinese woman's umbrella went in my ass at about 65 miles per.  And then it opened.  But I couldn't pull it out.  No? 
[03:43:30]  Tight, huh?  That old guy.  That old guy.  Very good.  Oh.  Then I was trying to commute home.  Uh-huh.  And they closed the FDR and the West Side Highway.  Yeah, it was a mess last night.  Well, I was stranded in Harlem with my Chevy Vega floating down Martin Luther King Boulevard.  For a second, I thought I was on a Disneyland Jungle Cruise.  Oh, come on.  That's wrong.  Well, I rolled down the windows and started snapping pictures going dance, you know, for me. 
[03:44:00]  And they dragged me from my car and beat me about the face and neck.  Well, they should have.  I'm very injured.  Oh, I hear that.  Where were the elephants and crocodiles?  You're not going to find them up there.  Oh.  And I saw the mayor of our fair city.  Yeah, Mayor Giuliani?  I passed by City Hall.  He was coming out and his toupee flew off and started chasing me.  It was like a tarantula.  Oh, the horror.  The horror.  It was like a big bug. 
[03:44:30]  And then I saw a wire hanging in the street.  So I thought I'd be a good Samaritan and move it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Sparks and smoke were coming out my ears and my ass.  And now I have a big afro.  I'm like Link from the Mod Squad.  I got home and my house was flooded.  Yeah.  And ruined all my sticks and REO Speedwagon records.  And my Atari 2600 game system was destroyed. 
[03:45:00]  How will I play Pog, God damn it?  Oh.  And then on my way home, I saw a huge puddle I was scared to drive through.  But the NYPD waved me on.  And they were laughing as I went underwater.  I cursed them.  They dragged me from the vehicle and put a nightstick in my ass.  Oh, come on.  Oh.  Oh.  I was so angry when I got home, I threw my wife in the fireplace. 
[03:45:30]  Very angry.  I've had it with this city.  Oh.  Oh.  Who saw that coming?  Well, that old gag, huh?  Yes.  All right.  Well, I'm...  Look where I'm calling from, where the magic happens from the Tom Likas show.  Should I take a dump on the board?  Well, you can do that if you like.  I'm very angry.  Why don't you leave a log for him?  I think I will.  A Yule log.  A Yule log, sure. 
[03:46:00]  Okay, thank you for hearing my gripes.  All right.  My ass is killing me.  All right, there he goes.  Thank you.  The guy that got injured from Hurricane Floyd.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027. </pre>
