<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to the next.  It began with a humorous, repetitive intro followed by a discussion of a book by a former colleague, Carol Miller, which allegedly criticized Opie and Anthony, detailing on-air arguments and incidents involving a fleet enema.  The hosts then recounted a 4th of July party attended by Amy Schumer, Bob Kelly, Keith Robinson, and others, describing it as comedic but sometimes abrasive.

A significant portion of the show focused on Opie's UFC trip to Vegas.  He detailed unprecedented access, including fighter interviews and acquiring numerous autographed gloves (which became a running gag).  He shared anecdotes about specific fighters, humorous mishaps like spilling coffee on his iPhone, and LeBron James's purported dismissive response to Bob Kelly's photo request.  This Vegas trip was repeatedly referenced throughout the show, with other hosts, including Anthony, Sam Roberts, Jim Norton, and Bob Kelly, adding their experiences.  Their Vegas trip included dinner with Joe Rogan, a Dice show at the Riviera (described as less energetic than newer casinos), and detailed accounts of UFC fights, specifically Anderson Silva vs. Chael Sonnen (including a discussion of a knee strike's legality) and Tito Ortiz vs. Forrest Griffin.  Travel experiences were also discussed, contrasting a positive Virgin America flight with a negative United/Continental flight, including a first-class complaint and an encounter (or lack thereof) with Anthony Bourdain.

The show included a humorous segment debunking the myth of fart-powered flight, calculating the impractical number of farts required for lift.  The death of Ernest Borgnine was also mentioned, referencing his long life and even a reported anecdote about his masturbation habits from a Fox News interview. This led to a discussion of *McHale's Navy*, its portrayal of Japanese people, and the political correctness in modern film, using *Mission Impossible* as an example. O.J. Simpson's 65th birthday and speculated prison life were briefly mentioned. A *McHale's Navy* clip was played, leading to further discussion of the show and its actors.  Sam Roberts's role as Bob Kelly's assistant, complete with a bandolier, during the Vegas trip was highlighted.

The broadcast also included a lengthy anecdote about the excessive walk between the Signature Towers and the MGM Grand, estimated at half a mile.  Chip Chipperson's audio from the UFC Fan Expo was played, followed by a sexually suggestive commercial for Elvis Dice Clay.  E-Rock's uneventful 4th of July weekend, accusations of him preferring "fancier" friends, his consumerism, and eating habits were discussed, leading to a tangent on the hosts' soda preferences and a Coke vs. Pepsi rivalry.  E-Rock's Sotus Bay vacation, potentially named after a pedophile, was also mentioned. A story about a child running through the MGM hallway and a party at Weez's cottage, including descriptions of two large black women dancing and a subsequent discussion about body image differences between black and white women, using derogatory and offensive language, were also included.  A female model, Margaret, called in, and her picture was shown on-air.

The show featured discussions about vacation observations, including descriptions of overweight black women in swimsuits.  This prompted a conversation about the hosts' perceived differences in reactions to seeing attractive Black men with white women versus white men with white women, referencing socioeconomic factors.  Listener calls about dating preferences followed, including discussions on interracial dating, economic disparities, and physical attributes, again employing explicit descriptions and judgments.  The upcoming US Presidential election and opinions on Obama and Romney were also touched upon. A song about a host’s preference for black women was played.  Viral videos of a near gas station explosion and a tightrope walker's fall were discussed, along with audio clips from Chip's awkward UFC Fan Expo interviews.  A video of Governor Chris Christie arguing with a passerby and subsequent discussion on gay marriage and its legal status across US states concluded this segment.

A caller's divorce led to a discussion about gay marriage and personal freedoms, using offensive language.  A news story about a shark encounter near Cape Cod led to a discussion about shark populations and, surprisingly, “sharking,” a slang term for a specific sexual act in bathhouses, followed by a debate on shark fishing. Jim Norton's fishing bit was also mentioned.  A debate on whether buffets are more famous in Vegas than shows and prostitution ensued.  A description of Roland's housewarming party, featuring excessive food and a Mickey Mouse-themed bathroom, along with a discussion about the lack of feedback and surprising recognition, concluded this segment.

Finally, the hosts reacted to the realization that Joe Rogan and Louis CK listen to their show, leading to anxieties about quality and acceptance of the show's lowbrow nature. This led to tangents about Chip Chipperson's new catchphrase ("E-Rock"), a recap of their Vegas trip, Troy's weekend activities (including a picture of his girlfriend urinating in the woods), an anecdote about a child splashing Sam, and a plug for Tacombie Tacos, which sparked a debate about a previous meat sauce segment. Roland was frequently mentioned as an on-site listener.  The show concluded with the hosts ending their broadcast.  A "Fuck You" segment featuring listener calls and previews of upcoming segments focusing on Bob Kelly's Iraq experiences and a farcical scientific inquiry into flatulence were also mentioned.

[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there? 
[00:03:30]  Nice to meet you.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you sound like I'm going to spend it, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sitting around.  Let's do this.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, he's enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die. 
[00:04:30]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Rain is over.  Clean your heart.  Clean your heart.  Oh.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  There we are.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  And quick as that, look, we're back.  We're back.  That happened.  Good morning, everybody.  Let's do boss jocks today.  Hey, the 70s boss jack.  The boss jack.  How's everybody doing?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you doing?  You're the boss jack.  What about that guy?  Boss jock. 
[00:05:30]  Charlie Tuna with you.  Remember Charlie Tuna?  I did a lot of driving.  I know we got a lot of story, but it goes back to the boss jock.  I gave my wife an earful on the music jock.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I was obsessing about the music DJ and went through the whole N.E.W. thing and how the only time we were completely in the wrong was when we made Carol Miller hang out in the mail room until we walked by back to our office and then she was allowed to go down the hall because it got so ugly at N.E.W. 
[00:06:00]  Apparently, Carol Miller has a book out where that's included.  Oh, it is?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  She really kind of bashes us pretty good in her little book.  I let that whole thing go and then she writes about it?  Yeah, I guess she's pretty pissed off about it.  Where is that?  I don't know.  How do you know about this?  The book is out?  Yeah, someone told me that she got a book out.  Or is it out-out or?  I don't know.  And she's just like trashing everyone.  Up all night, my life and times in rock radio. 
[00:06:30]  Shut up.  Rock radio.  You spun records.  W-N.E.W.  W-N.E.W.  W-N.E.W.  W-N.E.W.  W-N.E.W.  My wife got an earful.  I went through the whole fucking thing.  I'm like, you hear what this dope just did?  Because we're listening to a lot of satellite radio.  Because satellite radio is now regular radio, by the way.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo to satellite radio.  Changing it into exactly what regular radio was.  So there's a guy.  I don't even need to name names.  And he's doing his laundry list of songs and stuff.  And I go, you know that guy right now?  He's feeling good about himself. 
[00:07:00]  That he like.  Intro records.  He's on the air.  Right.  Living the dream.  Right.  Living the dream.  And I go, what a waste of fucking time the music jock was.  For the longest time.  At least the last 20 to 25 years.  It was a complete waste of time.  There was a point where, you know, the music jock actually picked the records.  Yeah.  Depending on the mood he was feeling.  He got to go deep and really just, really develop a playlist for the afternoon.  Or the morning. 
[00:07:30]  Or the middays.  But for the last 25 years, a dopey program director fucking gave him the list.  And then he goes through it.  And he feels good about himself.  That he introed like an Aerosmith record.  I think she had it with me.  I'm like, all right.  I get it.  I get it.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, that Carol Miller thing in the book.  She really like kind of twists things around.  Of course.  Like she brings up the fleet enema story and says that we were.  How do you know all this?  You read it?  Yeah.  Somebody took a picture of the page. 
[00:08:00]  Well, let's get.  Let's go through it right now.  Did she mention my fleet enema bit that I used to do?  I don't think so.  I was like, I'm an enema junkie, man.  Oh, no, you didn't.  I don't know what that means.  That's like chunky monkey.  I had an enema on stage.  A monkey's primate.  I would say that they were a fleet enema.  I would say they're so addictive.  And I go, you get hooked on these things.  Are there enema junkies running around?  Oh, then you're trying to paint that picture.  No, but I would drop the enema on stage.  And I would act like I was scratching my butt instead of my arm. 
[00:08:30]  Like, hey, man.  Oh, oh, I need a fix.  And it's your ass.  Is that what she talks about?  She talks about how she went out to the store to buy the enema after we got into that.  And she says that she didn't walk in on her own accord during that argument.  That on-air argument about, you know, music and we suck and she sucks.  She said that Gary Wall sent her in.  Which might be true.  Might be true.  Because Gary Wall loved confrontation.  Might be true.  He loved it. 
[00:09:00]  And she also said that.  And I don't mind that about Gary Wall, by the way.  She said that that whole thing with putting her in the mail room or whatever was backfired  because she was able to pick up the phone in there and listen to our phone calls.  And her and Eddie Trunk found out that I was cheating on my wife.  It's like, who didn't know?  I was fucking making out with her in the parking garage.  It's in the book?  Yeah, yeah.  I would sue her, man.  Fuck that bitch.  All these years they said we're cool and then she obsessively writes about us. 
[00:09:30]  What do you mean she was listening in on your phone calls?  That's wiretapping.  Yeah, exactly.  What, there was a phone line in the mail room?  That's what she said.  And she could pick it up and just eavesdrop on you?  I never talked on the phone there.  Where's it eaves?  Eaves.  Eaves.  Eaves.  Like in the eaves.  Eaves.  Eavesdrops.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, find that excerpt.  Yeah, she's...  If someone's got it, please send it in. 
[00:10:00]  I want to read it.  I hate the idea that we're probably selling books for her.  Books?  I didn't even know this was out.  It's not out yet.  Oh, it's not out yet.  Is it even printed?  No idea.  No, we got the best of her.  She knows it.  Shut up.  My listeners are my friends.  My friends.  I quoted that on the ride with my wife.  She told us one day, my listeners, they're my friends.  She was so delusional.  Wow.  This stupid music jock.  Shut up.  Wowie kazowie. 
[00:10:30]  You can write about it all you want.  It was nonsense.  Dub-a-doo and a dub-a-doo.  Dub-a-doo-ba-doo-ba-dee-da.  Ba-ba-ba.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  So she's got that out.  Find that for us, please.  Por favor.  So where do we begin, man?  It's been like, I don't know, a week since we saw each other.  So fucking 4th of July happened.  The little weekend after the 4th of July.  The UFC thing.  UFC.  We, yeah, decided last minute. 
[00:11:00]  I was at the Amy Schumer's 4th of July party out in Long Beach.  I was bummed I had to blow that off.  And holy fuck was that just nonstop fucking laughing.  Yeah, I can imagine.  At everybody.  Not good-natured laughing with people.  It was a constant attack on one person or another.  I was in the barrel for probably five hours.  I took a Bob Kelly was on fire.  And Keith was pretty good, too.  I got killed the 4th of July.  Really?  Murdered.  That's just so uncomfortable after a while. 
[00:11:30]  It is.  Don't you want to just kind of chill out and have a hot dog?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe a beverage.  You'd think.  You'd think, right?  That shit gets exhausting.  It's one of the prices you pay for hanging out with funny dudes.  That's what I was thinking to myself.  Like, you know what?  Because I had nothing.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  That was my idea of a comeback.  It was brutal.  How did it start?  Oh, who?  I don't remember.  I drove out with Bobby.  And I couldn't believe Anthony went.  Right.  Did I call you?  I texted you on the way or the day before? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, you texted me.  I'm like, hey, why don't you come over?  Because I forget he's having people over.  I'm like, why don't you come over?  You're feeling all right, eh?  You did a bunch of things outside the compound.  Oh, it was great.  But I was like, why don't you come over?  If you had nothing to do, come hang.  You always have people over.  So go do something you don't have to have people over for.  So me and Bobby were just hanging out, eating.  And who was there?  It was Amy was obviously there.  Rachel Feinstein, Keith Robinson, one of the waitresses from the Comedy Cellar. 
[00:12:30]  Just a few people scattered.  More people came.  And then Ant showed up, which I was surprised.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Trying to park sucked in Long Beach.  I orbited the place for a while.  And just leaving horrible messages on Bob Kelly's voicemail and texting Jimmy.  Oh, so you bring me out to Long Beach and then just ditch me?  Is this the joke?  Do they have parking lots?  They got parking lots, but every space is taken.  They got tow-away zones everywhere. 
[00:13:00]  So I kind of found one of those spots in one of the lines of parking where you angle in.  That is at the end of that spot.  And it's not quite a spot.  So it's got some yellow paint in there.  It kind of edged in there.  I figured it didn't look like a tow-away zone, but it looked like a ticket zone.  And that's probably just the cost of doing business, like a parking garage.  So I parked there, and no problem.  No ticket?  No ticket.  I don't understand these towns where they want you to come and enjoy, and then they make it very difficult to park. 
[00:13:30]  Very difficult to park.  So they can make even more money off you.  Yeah.  I bet you they don't need all those tow-away zones.  I didn't even see the place, and I would bet money that a lot of those tow-away zones could be just regular parking spots.  Of course it could be.  That's a little picture.  Sam just pulled up the group shot.  Where is Bobby in that shot?  Was he taking the picture?  He might have taken it.  Was he?  That's kind of weird.  I don't know.  Let me see here.  There's Anthony, myself, one of the waitresses from the cellar, Keith Robinson, Kurt, his girlfriend. 
[00:14:00]  Kurt Metzger.  Kurt Metzger, yeah, a comedian.  Who's that behind?  Is that Amy right there?  Was Amy wearing a bikini?  Yeah.  She looked really good.  She looked good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sherrod.  It worked.  It worked for her.  Good.  Good for her.  Sherrod and his girlfriend.  Greg Rogel, a guy named Steve, works at the Comedy Cellar.  Um, that's Ryan Hamilton, who's a, he's very funny, he's a, fuck, where's he from?  Utah.  Uh, Mormon comic, and then, uh, who the fuck are these guys here? 
[00:14:30]  Who the fuck are you guys?  That's Joe DeRosa.  Where's Joe DeRosa?  Yeah, he's back in the back.  And who's in the Maxim shirt?  Oh.  I'm not sure.  Oh my God.  And then the neighbor.  And the neighbor in the back.  The neighbor.  Going, who are these guys?  Oh, he was pretty cordial.  He was bringing champagne out and everything.  Yeah.  And then fucking Keith, it just, with, that was, that was the bit of the day.  Like, people would come walking by.  And, and I got, I got nailed with it so many times, because Keith, Keith is drinking some 
[00:15:00]  wine.  Yeah.  Give me a little more swirl on this glass.  A little more swirl on that.  And, and, and, like, it's, it's Long Beach, so, you know, there's some old decrepit guy walking  by with a little hat on.  He's got his towel, and he's going to the beach.  He's like 65 years old and shit.  And he's walking by, and, and Keith would be like, Anthony, Anthony.  And I turn around, going, what?  And he's calling to the fucking decrepit guy.  And that just kept going all day. 
[00:15:30]  Like, a big fat woman walks by, and he's like, Bobby, hey, Bobby.  It was, it was so fucking funny.  Every black guy that walked by was Keith.  Everyone that walked by, yeah, every black guy.  And then, like, just some haggard, old, blonde woman went by, and he's like, Amy, Amy.  It was so fucking funny.  That's classic.  And I got killed.  Bobby murdered me.  You were getting slaughtered.  All day.  With your dumb white socks.  I had my white tube socks, my shorts, and fucking, we went into the, to the ocean, which I never 
[00:16:00]  do.  Never.  Why don't you go in the ocean?  I'm never around it.  I don't really either, unless I'm, like, in the Caribbean.  It's fun.  But we all went in and had a fucking pisser.  How were the waves?  Great.  It was choppy, but fun, man.  Nice.  They were coming in one after another.  How many times did you have to save Keith Robinson?  He came in all drunk.  He did surprisingly well, considered his alcoholism.  And his race.  Hence the, how many times did you have to save Keith Robinson? 
[00:16:30]  But even other guys.  It was a bit of subtle humor there.  He was, he was just talking shit in the water.  It's like, wherever he goes, he gets his gaps.  I really got to talk shit, punching the waves.  Is he trying to punch sharks?  Yeah.  Talk shit to the sharks.  He's one of those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was talking some shit.  And, yeah, then Jimmy just said, you know, yeah, going to Vegas and stuff.  Why don't you, you should go?  Like, you know.  And I'm kind of, you know, I don't know.  And he's like, oh, fuck it.  Call Kenny.  He'll hold his spot. 
[00:17:00]  And then I just figured, yeah, what the fuck?  And that started phase two of hanging out with Jimmy and Bobby.  I couldn't fucking, I couldn't fucking believe that you went.  I know.  It was like, it was literally 20 hours before we left.  I saw that tweet.  I'm like, what is going on with this guy?  Absolutely.  You know what it was?  There was absolutely no reason not to go.  I would assume you had a lot of festivities planned for your place.  I did.  I was going to have some weekend festivities.  So you had to cancel it all.  Or did it go on without you? 
[00:17:30]  No, no.  I just, yeah, I told everybody, you know, eh, I'm in Vegas.  Sorry.  Later.  Later for you.  Go find your own fun.  You host every party.  It's like, you got to go out and do other stuff without fucking having the pressure of  having to have all the, you know, have everybody over your house.  Yeah, it was great.  How were the fireworks before you move on to the Vegas trip?  Did you stay for the fireworks?  There really weren't any.  Oh, the town's broke.  Yeah, the town.  We saw Laszlo.  He lives out there.  How was the town broke with all the parking?  That's what we were saying.  Non-parking. 
[00:18:00]  That means people are coming.  So what are you doing with all the money?  I think Long Beach is really like one of these real corrupt incorporated towns that don't  really, they have their own police force.  They have like their own everything.  And I think they're just.  How are they broke?  That's probably how.  I think people are lying in their pockets.  They're taking too much of a taste for themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  These are the fireworks aren't until a week from Friday.  Like from last Friday.  It's probably this Friday.  Yeah, because the fireworks company, they charge a lot when it's 4th of July weekend, 
[00:18:30]  but then you could get them afterwards for a lot cheaper.  Hey, that's a great idea.  So they decided.  I kind of like that idea.  So they decided to do it a little later.  Because you're overwhelmed with fireworks for two or three straight days, right?  If you spread that out, it'd be kind of cool.  Yeah.  Why not?  Have some fireworks in August.  Yeah, yeah.  Still looks cool.  Yeah.  It was.  I saw some on the drive home.  That was about it, though.  Yeah.  You know, you see them kind of on the horizon.  It's not like the old days where everybody had fireworks. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Just blasting them off in neighborhoods and everything.  I barely heard any.  Well, for the fourth year in a row, I chose to blow off the fireworks display that's literally  right outside my window.  People lose their minds every year about this.  They're like, why aren't you staying in your apartment?  You would have a front row seat to the Macy's fireworks.  Macy's Fortress Live fireworks.  And every year, I'd blow it off to go way upstate to see Brother Weez and the gang. 
[00:19:30]  Upstate.  But it's right outside my window.  Yeah.  Right outside.  Like, you talk about people.  They come from all over the place to see this thing.  Oh, yeah.  Stand for hours waiting.  And they line up along the shore, and there I have, like, I could just, like, walk out  of my bedroom and check it out.  And I blew it off again.  I gotta set up a camera to see how cool it is.  Oh, you should just do that.  To this day, I have no idea.  I have no idea.  Everyone says it's beyond amazing, and you're blowing this off year after year.  That would look cool from that high up, I bet. 
[00:20:00]  To see some shitty fireworks display, and so does Point.  Yeah.  Was it shitty?  Was it shitty?  It's just basic shit.  But, you know, they're not making smiley faces and whatever else they fucking do.  Like the Macy's do.  The Macy's people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fireworks.  Schmireworks.  Yeah.  I didn't mind.  It was fun.  We saw, like, maybe five walking down the boardwalk.  I didn't care.  Yeah.  Yeah, it would have been fun to see a few, but.  Yeah.  I don't really give a fuck about fireworks. 
[00:20:30]  But, oh, man.  We just had a fucking amazing time in Vegas.  I guess UFC people are unbelievably accommodating.  The best.  I mean, when the head of the whole fucking shittery comes over, and he's just like, holy shit, I'm so glad you made it.  Right.  I'm like, what the fuck?  You mean you're treated right?  Yes.  Treat it properly like gentlemen.  Is that a weird feeling?  It really is.  Have a company treat you right?  You know, we've been beaten down.  And actually say hi to you every once in a while? 
[00:21:00]  We've been beaten down so much.  It's almost like you feel like something's wrong.  Yeah.  That everything is going right.  Yeah.  You feel like there should be somebody that's going to tell you you can't do something.  And let me guess.  Everything was real easy.  Oh.  They were very accommodating.  100%.  There were no questions whatsoever.  Nothing.  It was perfect.  No back and forth forever.  It was great.  Me, Sam, and Bobby were doing a UFC special for the fight.  Like we were just interviewing fighters and talking to some fans. 
[00:21:30]  And then for the special to be Saturday night before the fight, like an hour before the fight for the pay-per-view.  Very cool.  And so we spent, what day, Thursday or Friday with just, they gave, of course, they gave us total access.  You know what I mean?  Like they didn't say, hey, you can't go there.  You can't talk to this one.  They gave us this green room area, this stage area.  They didn't put up walls when certain celebrities came in?  No.  No, they gave us access to everything.  Oh, that must be weird.  Exactly. 
[00:22:00]  They had access to everything.  You're not allowed.  Everybody.  But I work here.  What do you mean I can't look at Oprah?  What do you mean?  Put up a wall.  No.  They have no.  Total access.  They had no medias allowed in the Fan Expo.  They wanted to be for fans.  They don't want the media there.  So we were like the only.  And we just had, you know, with me, Bobby, and Sam, have like the microphone, a little recording system,  and like a handheld video camera just to do some chip nonsense.  No.  It wasn't a big production.  Yeah.  But they gave us access, like where no media had access.  So we were rapping with fans and bullshitting and rapping with fans. 
[00:22:30]  And then we went in the green room area, and any fighter that came through, if they wanted  to talk to us, we got them.  It was fucking great.  That's pretty cool.  Awesome.  That's really cool.  Everybody was nice.  Yeah.  Every.  And then I went on this thing like, you know how I'll get a glove sign when I'm here?  Oh, my God.  I might have heard a little bit about this already.  Oh, my dear sweet Lord.  I might have heard a little bit about this.  Oh, you heard the glove stories?  And Sam was privy to this whole thing. 
[00:23:00]  I just heard a very general thing about this.  You might get a little obsessive when it comes to your gloves and your picture taking.  He hadn't brought his gloves.  Right.  He hadn't brought any gloves.  And we didn't really know.  When we first, first got there, we were like, we might not actually get any fighters because  they're doing signings and they have long lines and stuff.  But then when we realized that all access passes actually gave us all access.  Real all access.  And we could go to the green room and literally that's every fighter went in there and all 
[00:23:30]  you had to do is walk up to him and every single fighter was like, yeah, of course I'll  do an interview.  Sure.  I'll sign this.  Sure.  I'll take it for you.  But you had an all access pass?  Yeah.  It was actually.  Kind of like the all access passes you guys had for Springsteen.  Same type of thing.  No.  What?  This one, a little different, this one got into the artist area and we were allowed  to talk to the artists.  But you worked for SiriusXM.  Wasn't your all access pass?  No, it wasn't.  Not all access? 
[00:24:00]  No.  No, no.  It was like Bruce.  Yeah.  No.  Not really.  I'm telling you, man, as they say, shit rolls downhill.  Yeah.  And because Dana loves us and fucking those guys, the top of the company treats us great,  everybody underneath does.  It really is the way it is, man.  It's a reflection of how everyone's going to treat you that when he comes in and he talked  to us before he talked to anybody.  And he talked to us for a while and they were trying to hustle him along because he had  other things to do.  And he's like, I'm fine.  He got really irritated with him trying to move him along. 
[00:24:30]  But it's like because he treats us so well and like Reed Harrison and the guy Jim Byrne,  who's their PR guy, everybody just kind of sees like, oh, these guys are treated well.  Right, right.  It really is that simple.  But you had an all access pass for Springsteen.  Didn't you have some kind of pass on you?  I should remember if we had passes for that or we just got like an after party wristband,  I think.  I think so.  Yeah.  I mean, we weren't allowed in that area.  I love fucking pushing pints. 
[00:25:00]  But here we were.  You were allowed to go pretty much anywhere.  Absolutely.  And no one questioned it.  And no one questioned it whatsoever because they knew you would behave and do the right  thing.  Whenever I'm walking with a badge at all access pass, I really, at the pass, I always expected  to go, oh, that's not good here.  Yeah.  It's all access, but not every access.  Everywhere we went.  Okay.  Right through.  Yeah.  And we were walking right behind fighters as they were signing, not even realizing it,  just trying to find the bathroom.  Everywhere. 
[00:25:30]  And nobody stopped us anywhere.  Fucking, we were doing interviews on Friday afternoon in the little staging area.  It was a green room.  Right, right.  And I saw, we were interviewing Pat Barry, who's a heavyweight, who's really a fucking  funny guy.  Like, Bobby recognized him.  I didn't recognize his face.  And just an awesome interview.  And I walked away in mid-interview to get a picture with Junior Dos Santos.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In the middle of an interview with one guy, he walks away to get a picture with another 
[00:26:00]  guy.  But Bob was yapping.  I wanted to talk to Junior Dos Santos.  Right.  He's a heavyweight champion.  Of course.  But Bobby wasn't looking.  Like, I didn't know how to wrap it up and go, Bob, Bob, shut up.  You know, because he wasn't looking at me.  He was just looking at Pat Barry.  So I was just like, I didn't want to interrupt.  I was like, they were doing great.  So I'm like, fuck it.  So as I'm holding the video camera, Jim hands me his microphone.  So I have to hold Jim's microphone while Jim leaves the interview.  And the camera.  To go get a photo with Junior Dos Santos.  But when he got there into the green room and started realizing, okay, Pat Barry's there. 
[00:26:30]  Junior Dos Santos is right here.  We are going to have access to all these fighters.  He started panicking because he didn't have gloves.  Didn't have gloves to sign.  And so he was like, Jim Byrne, who's in charge of PR, was bringing some gloves for Jim.  But he wasn't there yet.  Oh, shit.  So he's like, where's the gloves?  Where's the gloves?  So he went to the bathroom and he had missed like maybe three fighters so far.  And it was all he was talking about was gloves.  Yeah.  And what they do, like in their green room.  Something about the gloves.  The gloves. 
[00:27:00]  Exactly.  You have gloves.  You need gloves.  Something about the gloves.  I don't have gloves yet, but I need them.  They charge, I think they charge, like you can buy like a $3,500 ticket as a fan.  And you can hang out in the green room and get stuff signed and everything.  And so there was one guy who was there and he had a suitcase, like a giant suitcase you would have to check.  Full of UFC memorabilia to get signed.  And Jim went to the bathroom and while he was there, Bob bought a pair of gloves off this guy that were not signed so he could give them to Jim. 
[00:27:30]  And as he did that, Jim Byrne also showed up and gave Jim like four or five pairs of gloves that were official UFC.  Sounds like plenty of gloves.  Now, had a small area that was clean that could get signed that the official gloves did not have.  They say UFC on like the wristband, the wrist part and the top part.  Yeah.  Whereas these other ones had just UFC on the top and the black free area to sign. 
[00:28:00]  I would assume you want the official gloves, though.  Nah, the unofficial ones were better to sign.  I don't care about selling them.  I just want to have them.  And I foolishly assumed that he was looking to get one pair of gloves to get signed by everyone.  Right.  Multiple signatures.  Sure.  When he assessed all the situation, he now had five or six pairs of gloves in front of him.  He realized the unofficial gloves were the way to go.  And he purchased every pair of unofficial gloves that the guy had. 
[00:28:30]  Well, it was a few pairs.  I mean, I was just, I was like a junkie.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're being casual.  How many?  How many do you think he bought?  He definitely, that day, on the spot, probably bought six pairs of gloves from the guy.  Yeah, I was like a junkie.  How much per pair?  20 bucks a pair.  Although he wanted 15 from Bob, and Bob just gave him 20 to keep it, so he charged B20.  Oh, man.  So Bob fucked you.  But it was worth it, though.  I mean, and everybody that came through.  That's not bad.  I thought it was going to be like a dozen gloves. 
[00:29:00]  Listen.  Pairs of gloves.  At the end of the day, though, first of all, Jim's new strategy was everywhere we went the whole weekend.  Because you never know, because it's all in the MGM, and it's all, it's, Vegas is not a big place.  You don't know who you're going to see.  The fighters are all over the place.  And because the expo was there, it wasn't just the fighters on the card.  Every UFC fighter was in town.  Every single place we went, including dinner, Jim had...  You brought the gloves with him?  One, just one glove in my mouth.  One glove in his back pocket. 
[00:29:30]  One glove in his back pocket.  Just in case.  With a silver Sharpie.  So he could pull it out.  And a few times, it came in handy.  It did.  Yeah.  Not too outrageous.  No.  I'll tell you who I got in the hallway in the back from the bathroom, and I saw fucking Frank Mir.  I'm just walking, and there's Frank Mir in the hallway.  Yeah.  So we said hello, and I just asked him to...  Pull that glove out.  He should have put it on and punched you.  But, dude, I didn't want to...  I didn't...  I don't usually...  I'll get pictures in those places, but I didn't...  I wouldn't...  But I was right there, and we were going to be staying there, talking to people. 
[00:30:00]  So I'm like, why wouldn't I get them signed?  I usually only do that in studio.  I never bring memorabilia to events.  Never try to get those guys to sign when they're fighting.  Ever.  We just...  I'm like...  It's like being in studio, and you're in the green room.  Because after you talk to a guy...  Like, we were talking to Shane Carwin.  We had to wait for him to finish eating.  And then we talked to him for about 10 minutes, and then he's like, all right.  And he starts eating again.  It's like...  We're just hanging out in the room with these guys.  So I was like, why not get it?  I'm here.  Jim...  Well, we all actually...  We had to redo our carry-on packing at the end of the trip, because UFC hooked us all 
[00:30:30]  up with all kinds of swag and stuff.  But, uh...  And he gave us, like, all sports bags and stuff like that.  But Jim had a huge issue, because at the end of the trip, he had 22 signed gloves.  22 signed gloves.  In a giant duffel bag that I packed.  I had to redo my carry-on.  He's carting around this giant bag with 22...  Separate fucking gloves.  Where is this stuff going? 
[00:31:00]  I have a...  I'm actually having my apartment redesigned a little bit.  Like, I just have a couple guys doing it.  A glove store.  He's going to have it designed into it.  You've been telling me lately you need, you know, a two-bedroom or whatever.  Now I know why.  It's just so you can throw all your junk in one room.  But I'll never sell them.  Sorry, I'm calling it junk.  I don't want the money for them.  I just like having them.  I think they're kind of cool.  A duffel bag filled with UFC gloves.  Filled with gloves.  And he was walking around, and he jokingly at one point...  Why would you just take pictures, and then you got...  That's easy.  Yeah, I did that.  That's a little picture card you could throw in your pocket. 
[00:31:30]  He jokingly at one point said, with him walking around the expo with a UFC sports bag full  of signed gloves, he said, yeah, people must think I'm a fighter or something.  And I said, no, people think you're a dork walking around with a giant bag of memorabilia.  He was right.  As opposed to a guy who's on the Tonight Show every three weeks.  Yeah, yeah.  You do realize that, right?  You're a big star, Jimbo.  You know, but you know what?  It's like, I love...  That's the gloves?  That's the first thing.  That's day one. 
[00:32:00]  I took a picture of him.  One, two, three, four, five...  There's like 16 there.  10, 15, 15...  Yeah, there's an extra one over there.  Wow.  16 gloves.  But you see the red ones?  You see the differences?  The ones with the red strap, he had to buy...  They were willing to give him...  They would give all of us whatever we wanted for free, but Jim wanted those unofficial ones  that they didn't have there.  So I paid for them.  I feel bad taking swag from the UFC.  Like, I'll take a shirt, but it's like, they take such good care of us, I don't like to  take advantage.  They hook us right up. 
[00:32:30]  Like, I didn't need them to give me all this free stuff.  It's like, I feel bad taking the free stuff from those guys.  Oh, my God.  That's 17 gloves, actually.  Oh, is it?  In the first picture.  Who are the sum of the signatures?  Sorry, Sam.  Chuck Liddell is on a pride glove.  That was...  Bobby got me that.  I wouldn't ask Liddell to sign...  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Get it out.  Ring it out.  I spilled coffee all over my iPhone.  You're getting so excited.  No, no, I just...  You're right.  Give a little shakedown like that. 
[00:33:00]  He was really excited.  Get any liquid out of it.  I don't know if there's any...  I hope not.  How bad was the spill?  No, well, I have a case on it.  Oh, you should be all right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think it just went on the front.  You'll be all right.  Let's see.  That's so fucking...  That's a thing of the future.  That's something we never anticipated growing up.  What?  That you spill liquid on your fucking phone.  That has everything you need.  Your phone and your whole life is in it.  Right.  Who are some of the ones?  I got some cool ones.  I mean, I did not get Pat Barry because we didn't have one. 
[00:33:30]  Let me see who some of these guys are.  This one is a guy named Kung Lee.  It's really hard.  What I should have done was taking a picture of the glove after I talked to the guy because  I don't know who happened.  Oh, my God.  You can't match the signatures up.  Oh, my God.  In the end, he doesn't even know who signed the gloves.  I'll have to look through them.  I got...  How are you going to figure that out?  I'll just look them up.  I got...  Nate Diaz was a hard one to get because he never...  He hates doing interviews.  I got him.  I got Shane Carwin, Junior Dos Santos to sign one. 
[00:34:00]  Um, he asked, uh, Liddell, uh, who else?  I got Kung Lee.  I got, uh, Noguera.  Fucking, uh, Frank Mir.  Wait, so that's not all the gloves?  So you're looking to pawn them or sell them?  Uh, earlier today, Jim walked in with a bunch of UFC gloves that are signed.  But it's just, it's painful to be Jim.  Like, I feel so, so bad that Jim has to be Jim because...  The stress level is, uh, crazy.  He literally had with him on his purse in a bag full of 18 signed gloves and all he 
[00:34:30]  would obsess about was the one that he didn't get.  The one that got away.  It's craziness.  When do you, when do you relax?  I relax.  I mean, as much as I do, I'll tell you one thing in Vegas, I was completely hooker free.  I didn't do anything dirty in Vegas.  Wow.  I was in Vegas and I spent time thinking about my dumb gloves and having fun and talking  to these guys, but it really is fun.  Like, even though it's stressful, it's not, there's much worse things to do in Las Vegas 
[00:35:00]  for a compulsive psycho.  You were on a mission.  Um, and I, the gloves, I, I won't bring that.  And I'll tell you, I've showed restraint because after we went to the weigh-in, which  was fucking 8,000 people at the weigh-in.  It's the biggest weigh-in they've ever had.  Where do they do the weigh-in?  They do that in the, they, like half of the arena is for the weigh-in and, uh, the guys  all come out and basically is what it is.  They just come out and they do the weigh-ins and the fuck, they take a photo, like, you  know, fist to fist and, uh, the fucking place goes crazy. 
[00:35:30]  And, uh, after the weigh-in we went, we, of course, Jim Byrne takes such good care of  it, right backstage.  We, we got all this audio.  We got most of the audio on Friday.  We got some on Saturday, but most on Friday because we wanted to have it ready for the special.  Um, like we got Dana to start the, the special off and I wanted to get fucking, see if I  can get Chael Sonnen to close the special out.  I said, I know it's going to be hard because he's fighting the next day, but let's just  see if we can get him.  I mean, he knows me, so maybe we'll be able to get him to say a couple words. 
[00:36:00]  So after the weigh-in, these guys go backstage.  The first thing they do, cause they're all dehydrated.  Like if you watch the weigh-in, they get weighed in, you know, 185 and before fucking Anderson  Silva comes out, Chael's on the stage guzzling water.  Like it's the first.  Yeah.  Cause they're parts, these guys.  So really is amazing how much weight they could fucking lose.  They can slice easily 15 pounds in a day and they're just, they're all dehydrated and  fucking, you know, just to get down to fighting weight.  Right, right.  And then they'll put the 15 pounds back on that night through whatever they do. 
[00:36:30]  And, uh, so we go in and back and, uh, all the fighters are back there.  The weigh-in, like, uh, Anderson goes up to his area and we see Chael, they're like these  little bleacher areas.  And, uh, there's really, there's a little bit of press back there, but not much.  And we just see Chael sitting there with his, surrounded by his people.  And he's literally with his bare hands eating fruit.  He's just shoveling fruit into his face to get food.  And they bring like little coolers of food for these guys.  As soon as they're weighed in, they can eat.  Um, so they're eating sandwiches. 
[00:37:00]  And, uh, I was like, let's just see.  Cause there was a UFC camera crew waiting.  Can I stop you for a second?  Is this, uh, the, the day before the fight?  The night?  Yeah.  This is when they do the weigh-in.  How fucked up is that?  That they have to get all their nutrition and, and, you know, and they got to hydrate.  It really is.  All part of the game.  Less than a day before the big fight.  I guess it's the way sports have been with, with weigh-ins probably forever.  Right, right.  But Rogan told us what they do, which I, he's like, they have fucking IVs that they take  these things.  And he said, it's so much faster than going through your stomach walls with water and, 
[00:37:30]  and like, you know, saline or whatever it is these guys need.  Fucking IV them.  They IV them and they, they hydrate them and, you know, get them nutrition or whatever they  need.  But we were standing there, like, right from where I am to where you are is where Chael  was.  And, um, the UFC camera crew, he was very weak, I think, because he had me and, uh, or he  was just focused, but he wouldn't talk to them.  And, uh, and he wasn't, just wasn't doing, he was done with his interviews, but, you know,  so when he, when he came by, he said hello.  And then he just, he kind of kept going and, you know, it was fine.  I mean, I didn't, I wasn't going to ask him to sign anything. 
[00:38:00]  Bob was laughing at Jim though, because of, uh, because he was, because Chael became the  obsession at the weigh-in.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, I wanted to get him to, I wanted to get a glove signed by him, but I really, what  I really wanted to do was get him on the fucking special, just talking to us.  We were backstage before the weigh-in and Chael walked by us and Jim just was going,  Chael, Chael, there's Chael, Chael just walked by, Chael, Chael.  But I show restraint in those moments.  I don't, I'm not an idiot, like, I'm not going to ask a guy, like, when he's in that  fucking fight zone. 
[00:38:30]  But inside, it's killing you.  It's killing you.  You know what, it's killing you.  Jim didn't show a huge amount of restraint.  When didn't I show restraint?  He annoyed a fighter that is not only one of the most badass fighters that I've seen  in the cage, he's notoriously one of the nicest fighters out of the cage, and Jim annoyed  him.  Tito?  No, Vanderlei Silva.  No, Tito was very happy to see him.  Tito was very nice outside.  Vanderlei Silva.  Right. 
[00:39:00]  Who are we, he was sitting there eating, right?  And they were going to take my picture.  But I'm like, no, let's just wait till he's done it.  Let's wait.  I was waiting for him to finish eating.  Because back in there, there was fans in the green room getting stuff signed, so I didn't  feel bad asking him.  It's exhausting to listen to.  But I was waiting for the guy to finish eating.  This is like being inside Jimmy's head.  Yep.  Jim was saying, he was out loud to me and Bobby going, okay, no, no, no.  Because also, when Jim has a plan in mind, he starts kind of reciting things that are  going to happen. 
[00:39:30]  Like, nobody asks.  And he'll just be like, okay, yeah, we'll get the picture, and then we'll go here.  Everybody's like, yeah, we know what we're going to do.  He doesn't.  So he's talking to Bob and me and saying, no, he's eating right now.  We'll just wait till he's done eating, and then I'll ask.  He's eating.  We don't want to interrupt him.  We don't want to interrupt him while he's eating.  He's saying all this, standing directly behind him while he's eating, so Vanderlei can hear  Jim going, he's eating, he's eating, we'll wait till he's done eating, and just standing  over him.  Are you positive he could hear you?  Of course! 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, he probably could.  He definitely could.  And he's just finishing his sandwich, and just feels me and Jim and Bob looming over  him.  Which is worse than just going up, getting it over with, and leaving.  And Jim going, he's eating, he's eating, he's eating right now.  And so he finishes eating, and Jim gets the photo.  But the photo doesn't come out right.  It's a little blurry.  It's the only one that didn't come out.  It's a little blurry.  You have to ask him again.  So we go back on Saturday during the day. 
[00:40:30]  And Vanderlei was in there.  And Vanderlei comes in.  And Bob got the greatest picture of this, because, you know, he's getting, he just got  in, and he's getting his stuff, and he's getting ready to eat.  And Jim starts going, hey, hey, Vanderlei, dude, can you get a picture?  Vanderlei has to be like, just wait a minute, I'm going to eat.  Well, he took a picture with some kids.  With some kids?  No, but I mean, I figured he was doing pictures.  So I was asking him, and he turned around and looked to see who was asking him, and he 
[00:41:00]  got annoyed.  There's a great picture of this.  Show me this.  I will get to it.  I think Bobby tweeted the picture.  Look at his face.  Look at Vanderlei.  He's brushing me off.  Look at his face.  It's the definitive fucking pissed off as, it's fantastic.  Jimmy's like, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I could see in your face, you're like, oh, boy, that wasn't a good idea. 
[00:41:30]  Excuse me, van.  Oh, that's a great picture.  You tweet all this shit.  No, I haven't.  You got to tweet some of this shit.  Bobby Twittered that one.  I'll retweet it.  Please do.  I just didn't want to blow up my timeline, because I got photos with so many fucking guys.  Right.  Jim did finally.  And after that annoyance, Jim waited until once again, Vanderlei was done eating.  And Jim had to say, hey, so can we get that picture?  At which point, Vanderlei was very nice.  And I said I was sorry.  And he goes, oh, that's right. 
[00:42:00]  I was like, look, I'm sorry.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, he's notoriously the nicest guy in the fucking, in the UFC.  And we had, the night of the fight, the seats they gave us were amazing.  Dude, fucking amazing.  That's gotta be weird, too.  I know, that's odd, too.  Really?  That we actually had, you know, tickets, and they were great seats.  We're normally in this section where they have sectioned off.  That's where I get some pictures, too.  Like, where there's, like, where all the actors and stuff will sit. 
[00:42:30]  Not just pictures, because Jim went to the fight carrying a plastic bag with three unsigned gloves.  Just in case.  Did he get them signed?  I got two of them signed.  Okay.  Um, I didn't go crazy there, but I, I, here's the way we do it.  We get there, normally this is an area that they'll put us in.  Where they have, like, you know, any comics or actors or, or, or fighters.  But this, it was, there was, there was some, uh, some foreign dignitaries that were there.  So this area was packed because, uh, they have extra security, and I believe there was Secret Service. 
[00:43:00]  Like, there was a lot of people who were not normally there in those seats.  I mean, there was, like, the only, there was a couple of celebs, like, John Jones, Liddell, there was a few fighters in there, and, uh, LeBron James was there, but.  Okay.  Uh, I, I saw a lot of these pictures, and I, I saw LeBron James, and I'm like, is that John Jones or LeBron James?  Do they look similar, or am I crazy?  Well, I know I'm crazy, but.  Jones had a beard this time.  Jones had a beard.  They look similar, but not in person, because Jones is just, he, he, he, LeBron is so much better. 
[00:43:30]  Wait, it was, I, it might have been one of your pictures, Ann.  Was that LeBron James or John Jones?  That was LeBron with the chicks?  That was LeBron.  LeBron, for a second, I thought it was John Jones.  Yeah, he blew Bob.  And then I got confused.  LeBron blew Bob off for a picture.  Did he?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see it.  Well, because Bob tried to be all cute with it.  I still don't know if he knew Bob wanted a picture or not.  I know, that's what I'm thinking.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  Because LeBron, we were, we were, where they wound up putting us, since they couldn't put us in that area, it was in the area right next to us.  We sat behind Chael's mother.  She was in the role, and his girlfriend was in the role ahead of us. 
[00:44:00]  So I guess that's, uh, those are good seats?  Second row.  Yeah, yeah.  Second row.  You were in the second row.  We were in the second row, right behind Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  Amazing seats.  Wow.  Better than normal, actually.  Yeah, right.  So, but I was on the last seat by the, by the, uh, like the section, that section was right to my left.  Like, literally, it was like from where I am to where Anthony is.  Right.  And so, uh, when those got, like, we were sitting two seats in front of, I think, LeBron's manager.  So he came over and was talking, and, uh, there was, like, girls around us, like, I guess that, that, that UFC guys know. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Taking pictures with LeBron.  And, uh, I wasn't there for this.  I had gone to the bathroom.  And then Bobby, I guess, took a picture of them with him.  And then goes, hey, do you take pictures with fat white guys, too?  And LeBron just turned around.  And turned around.  What?  But I think, Bob, I don't know.  I, Bobby will say he knew, but I don't know if he knew because Bobby saying that, I'm like, maybe he, he, he gets, this guy gets his balls busted all the time.  He might have thought Bob was just being a dick or fucking being sarcastic. 
[00:45:00]  Should have just asked for a fucking picture.  Dude, that's what, I said hello to him.  He didn't remember me, but I said hi to him, and he said hi.  He was, he shook my hand.  He was okay.  I know he didn't remember me, but he was pleasant.  Yeah.  And he's got his championship.  Yeah.  We were literally right behind fucking, right behind Chael, Chael's, uh, family, like his brother and his people.  Yeah.  We couldn't have been, if I was one row closer, I would have literally been tapping Rogan as he announced the fight. 
[00:45:30]  That's how fucking close we were.  Awesome seats.  Yeah.  And an awesome time.  It just was fucking, just great to watch.  A lot of fun.  That's your first one, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the first live one I went to.  They're great, aren't they?  Fucking great.  The energy in the place, too.  It's like, it literally, something happens.  Like when the prelims, when people are coming in, and they're good fights, people are just kind of coming in and getting settled.  And then when they go live, it's just this fucking, it really is this weird gladiator thing. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  It definitely is.  And then, um, yeah, Rogan, we had a blast with that motherfucker.  Holy shit.  What a pisser.  Went out to dinner.  Oh, fuck.  I forgot about Friday night.  You want to save that for after the break?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, we had a great, we had a great night Friday night, a non-UFC, uh, stuff.  Yeah, we all went out and just fucked up.  Yeah, we want to hear about the Rogan Dice thing.  And the fact that, uh, Sam was, was Bobby's bitch the entire fucking weekend.  Assistant.  Assistant, he called him.  Why do you put up with that shit, Sam?  That's what I was there for, to help Jim and Bob be as, come off as, being as talented as they are. 
[00:46:30]  Well, you, you didn't, I guess Jim didn't need all that much help.  Not as much as Bob needed, because you were, you were Bobby's bitch.  Well, I couldn't fit 22 gloves in my bandolier.  Oh, boy.  Well, more from Vegas, as you guys went out there for the UFC thing.  Also, I want to hear about, um, the plane rides.  Oh.  I want to hear about.  Fuck United Airlines.  The gambling.  Ah, not much.  Not much.  Not much there.  A couple of good things, but.  And hanging out with Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  All on the way.  Stay there.

[00:49:00]  Christ.  Fuck you, hemorrhoids.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  On the next American War Stories.  Battleground.  Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we like brought like little bars and stuff like 
[00:49:30]  there's going to be no food.  There was more.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was.  You go to the buffet.  There's Chinese food.  Mac and cheese.  Barbecue.  Pizza.  Ice cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and Sundays as you want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell. 
[00:50:00]  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories.  Have you ever wondered how much hot piss your body produces over the course of your entire life?  How many pounds of dead, smelly skin will you shed into your mattress?  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my quest for knowledge and discovery, seeking answers to the questions that man has  pondered since the dawn of time. 
[00:50:30]  On today's episode, how many farts would it take to fill a hot air balloon?  Hot air balloons come in different shapes and sizes, but the average standard balloon takes  65,000 cubic feet of air to lift it.  After squeezing and sharding some numbers, it seems the average human flattest release  measures 62 milliliters.  That translates to .0022 cubic feet per fart, or as I like to call them, cubic farts.  That figures out to 29,545,455 farts. 
[00:51:00]  To put that in a warm, moist perspective, all of Australia can fart inside the balloon with  enough room for all of Austria to cut one, too.  Unfortunately, a fart is mostly nitrogen, and while it is 3% lighter than air, it's simply  not enough to lift that balloon.  That myth is busted.  But that doesn't mean we still can't fill shit up with farts.  Well, not fill shit up with farts.  I don't even know how that would work anyway. 
[00:51:30]  And the shit smells bad enough.  Why would anybody want to put farts inside shit?  Anyway, if you did want to fuel flight with farting, we would need thrust.  The average fart generates roughly .2 newtons.  If you weighed 180 pounds, just budging you off the ground would take 800 newtons.  We would need upwards of a half million liters of fart, or 8,064,516 farts.  And finally, the average human produces about a half liter of farts every single day. 
[00:52:00]  So that's one pint glass full of fart, every single day, man or woman.  I am buzzed already.  Join us next time on an all-new How Much.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Iraq, that's great.  Stupid Iraq. 
[00:52:30]  Good morning, everyone.  Iraq, why'd you play the worst of Sweet Brook?  Going in the break.  We're live.  I didn't realize I grabbed from the wrong file.  Yeah, but then Sam had to tell you, and you had this look of, what?  What just happened?  What?  Don't you listen to what you're playing?  Not usually to break, no.  That's a very bad.  That's not a good policy.  No, it's not.  Is this a thing?  Is this part of your bit?  No, this is nothing.  Nothing?  No. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Ernest Borgnine died.  Oh.  You know what show I forgot all about?  McHale's Navy.  McHale's Navy.  That was huge.  That fucking show was hilarious.  McHale.  Who was the, was it the sergeant, the captain, character actor with that weird voice?  Yeah.  They were playing clips of him on a bunch of the news shows.  McHale.  He was always mad.  McHale.  He was always angry.  Who was that guy?  And was he in anything else?  Joe Flynn.  Very good.  Someone knows it. 
[00:53:30]  He was funny, man.  Yeah.  But Ernest Borgnine, I was reading some of the tweets and everyone's deeply sad and it's  like, how are you sad for a guy that lives to 95?  95 had a great career.  I get you're going to miss him and all, but it wasn't like he died tragically.  No.  We'd all sign up for a 95.  In good health, by the way.  Because a mere, what, a year or two ago, he was talking about masturbating.  Talking about jacking off on the Fox News.  I think I got that clip, actually, really fast.  Yeah.  How are you sad for a guy that made it to 95, was still able to jerk off, and he seemed 
[00:54:00]  like he still had it all together?  They would interview him every once in a while as he's walking around Hollywood.  Didn't seem like he lost his marbles or nothing.  But real quickly, you're 91 years old.  You look fantastic.  You look like you're in your late 60s, early 70s.  What's the secret?  I don't dare tell you.  Don't eat meat.  Don't eat meat.  I masturbate a lot.  Okay, I think we're all...  What? 
[00:54:30]  Thank you, Ernie.  I actually heard that.  Ernie, have you ever been on YouTube before?  Listen.  Listen.  Yes to me.  Yes to me.  What?  What are you talking about?  How about this guy?  Okay, we're going to take a quick time out, and you'll be in the after the show show.  We'll be on to FoxandFriends.com.  I just shook his hand.  It's pretty funny.  They handle it pretty well.  Yeah, yeah.  He pulled an E-Rock there thinking, you know, you could just whisper something on mic. 
[00:55:00]  There you go.  In 91, he's masturbating.  Yeah.  Made it to 95.  I would assume, you know, he was masturbating.  Still jacking off.  Pretty close to 95.  That McHale's Navy, too, was one of those shows back in the day where...  Look, by the way, this was before our time, but they re-ran the shit out of it when I was  growing up.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  It was on the air from 62 to 66.  Yeah.  And enough time, but not enough time, had gone by with World War II where they were still 
[00:55:30]  able to talk about the Japs, because that was a part of the show.  It was a comedy, but they were on a PT boat in the Pacific, so they were fighting the Japs,  and they were constantly talking about the Japs, and they had one Japanese guy that I  guess was a deserter, that was a friend of theirs, that they had to hide from the brass.  He didn't like dinner?  No, that's not that, Chip.  Jesus, Chip.  Go ahead, Chip.  And they spoke with him, and the brass didn't know he was there. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  And he was so stereotypical of a Japanese person back then.  Yeah, but, I mean, in the old days, he used to acknowledge the enemy.  Yeah.  You know, I saw that Mission Impossible movie, and we have a problem with Russians still?  Apparently so.  It's safe.  When that should have been, you know, Middle Easterners?  Should have been Middle Eastern terrorists, yeah.  Even though they filmed in Dubai to sort of tell you, well, look, we know what the real  problem might be.  Yeah.  The Middle East, but we can't really do that in this PC world, so we have a problem with 
[00:56:30]  the Russians.  They're trying to sell movies.  Oh, God.  Is this Mission Impossible 3?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Enough already.  Yeah.  The nuclear launch codes.  I was like, are you fucking joking?  A year is this.  Nuclear launch.  Here's my guess, because they didn't show anybody falling off the Burge Tower.  Right.  I'll bet you that they fucking put on.  I'll bet you Dubai put money into that movie, or some investor put money into that movie  and said, just can't be Middle Eastern terrorists, and don't have anybody falling out of that  building.  Don't show anyone dying. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Make us look good.  I mean, that was my first Mission Impossible movie, so I liked it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I liked it.  It was all right.  But, I mean, let's go with, you know, the enemy everyone's thinking of, which is Middle  Eastern terrorists.  Of course.  Hogan's Heroes.  It was in a concentration camp.  P.O.W. camp.  Right.  Yeah.  Did you like McHale's Navy?  I watched it, you know, all the reruns growing up.  You watched that?  Sure.  I thought it was funny.  Get us a clip from McHale's Navy, Sam, when you get a chance. 
[00:57:30]  It was probably not funny, but at the time, I remember laughing as a little tater tot.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, back to...  Ernest Borgnine.  Oh, and since we're doing, you know, commemorative things, I guess, happy birthday, OJ.  65.  He made it to 65.  65.  I wonder what he's doing in jail right now.  You think that shit?  Like, what is OJ doing right now in jail?  He's probably doing something fun.  He's probably smiling, laughing, talking to people. 
[00:58:00]  Just joking around.  He's OJ.  Just joking around the weight room.  He's OJ.  He's just behind the bars.  He's in prison, but he's still OJ.  Yeah.  Is this a good clip to play?  I guess.  McHale's Navy.  You don't even know what McHale's Navy is, do you?  No.  I mean, I know what it is.  Oh, God.  What is it?  Kelsey Grammer remade it into a movie with Kelsey Grammer.  Oh, boy.  But Tim Conway was in this damn show as well.  Look at Tim Conway.  A young Tim Conway.  Should we play from the beginning? 
[00:58:30]  If you want to.  Let's see what that is.  You don't want us to play this, Sam?  No, I don't care if you play it, but I mean...  A lot of people are all about the Ernest Borgnine thing today.  Well, McHale.  Yeah.  I just want to hear that guy.  Somehow you always manage to clear the decks just in time.  Oh.  He's dressed like a woman.  Bride.  Bride, yep. 
[00:59:00]  What in the blue Pacific is going on in here?  That is.  How are they doing with these dresses?  Well, when you see, sir...  His voice is great.  A show that the special service officer is putting on.  Yes, sir.  Special service officer.  Yes, sir.  Anson Parker.  He's our special service officer.  And he's a wizard, this stuff, sir.  A regular Ziegfeld.  Is that right, mister?  I am.  I mean, I am.  Yes.  Very young Tim Conway.  Call me Ziggy. 
[00:59:30]  I'll blow your mind.  Ready for this?  Ernest Borgnine in this clip is 45 years old.  Wow.  He looks like he's 60.  50 years ago.  Wow.  He looks like he's 60.  He was already 45, though, too.  That's pretty fucked up.  What happened to people back then?  And then he just kind of stopped.  He got old, young, but then stayed there until he was 95.  He looked the same.  He was in the Poseidon Adventure, right?  Yes, he was in the Poseidon Adventure. 
[01:00:00]  He was 79 when they did it.  I saw a picture of him and what was the chick that he was with in the Poseidon Adventure?  Shelly, uh...  No, it was...  I thought, uh...  Someone will get it.  Shelly Winters.  No, Shelly Winters was the fat one.  He was supposed to be a vice cop that married a hooker that he had arrested many times.  That was their whole gimmick.  Yeah, over his left shoulder in that picture there.  Oh, fuck, you're right.  She used to be in Mad Magazine.  Was she? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They would show her all cartoony and...  Stella Stevens.  Thank you, Jayster.  And she used to have the big boobies and the nips and stuff in Mad Magazine.  Oh, yeah, all right.  That was in the Poopside Down Adventure, they called it.  Yes, yes.  The Poopside Down Adventure in Mad Magazine.  A very famous episode of Mad Magazine.  They weren't very good at coming up with Todd.  Find it, though.  She looked hot as hell.  I think I might have even jacked off to her, that magazine back then.  Apocalypse Now was a crock of shit now.  A crock of shit now, yeah.  Which was funny.  And they beeped that shit.  And then a clockwork orange was a crockwork lemon. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, boy, were they wacky.  I liked Mad Magazine.  Yeah, me too.  I don't know if it holds up, but...  Oh, back...  I really enjoyed that shit when I was growing up.  Then I graduated to...  And what was it called?  Oh, you got it?  Oh, yeah, the Poopside Down Adventure.  The Poopside Down Adventure.  There it was.  Just poopy humor.  Yeah.  A lot of poopy humor in Mad Magazine.  So that's all we got.  Yeah, a lot of poopy humor.  He was in Spongebob Squarepants, too.  Was he? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, he was the mermaid guy.  He kept working, didn't he?  The mermaid thing there.  Kept working?  Yeah.  What a guy.  Now he's dead.  See where that got him?  See all that?  Poor guy.  So back to Vegas.  Oh, man.  Sam, Jimmy, Anthony, Bob Kelly all went to Vegas for the UFC fight.  The UFC.  Sam was Bobby's bitch.  Yeah.  The first time I saw Sam...  I guess that's not a bit anymore, huh?  Bobby kind of likes you.  My mom called yesterday after I got home. 
[01:02:00]  Concerned.  And she tried to be casual about it.  She goes, so you had your own room, huh?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I had my own room.  Oh, man.  She's like, oh, so you didn't end up sharing a room with Bob Kelly.  No, Mom.  Bob Kelly didn't touch me.  But how does she know this shit?  She listens to the show.  Yeah.  You call her up.  Play sound clips.  It was embarrassing to watch him just...  You were fawning over Bob. 
[01:02:30]  No, I was assisting him.  He had everything in the bandolier.  Well, Bob presented me at the airport on Thursday morning.  We showed up at the airport.  And Bob presented me with a bandolier.  Yeah.  And he said, this is what...  You have to wear this all weekend.  And we decided I had to put my keys on it, so that way I jingle when I walk and they'd know...  Jim and Bob would know when I was coming.  Like putting a bell on a cow or something.  And then I would have to fill the bandolier with things that Bob and Jim might need. 
[01:03:00]  Tissues, toothpicks, mints, gum, a rock.  Things like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Bobby would just ask for these things.  Yes.  He wouldn't even ask for them.  He'd tell them.  Why do you play longs?  He'd say things like, ah, my throat hurts.  My throat...  And then Sam would come flying over.  Here's a lozenge.  Here's a lozenge.  I was sitting on the other side of the cage from them at UFC. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  And I actually had to run around the entire arena and convince the security to just let  me through for a second so I could bring Bob Kelly a lozenge.  He was having throat problems.  Yeah.  He was having severe throat problems.  And I had the lozenges in my bandolier.  Why do you play long?  Why do you play long?  Why was I there?  Why do you play long?  Because that's why I was there.  I mean...  What's that about?  What's going on there, Sam?  Why else would I be in Vegas for?  And not to assist Bob Kelly and Jim Norton.  No, and Jim Norton.  It would be one thing if that's what you were doing, but you were fawning over Bobby. 
[01:04:00]  Jim didn't need as much assistance as Bobby did.  I needed very little.  I basically needed Sam on camera and Sharpie duty.  And the bandolier.  I had Sharpies for Jim if he needed them.  He did have them.  This Bobby bit's a...  It's a bit, right?  It's not real.  He needed an assistant.  This is a bit, right?  He needed an assistant.  I don't understand what's so hard to figure out about this.  It's a nice picture of you.  I like that picture of you.  Oh, that's wonderful.  On the little walking, the little moving sidewalk-y thing.  And look how well the bandolier fits me. 
[01:04:30]  He got me a medium.  That's how I knew he really did get one just for me.  You did wear it better than he did.  Oh, thank you.  Because his was just...  His would rest up on his side.  Really?  It was just...  Fucking Bobby, man.  But then...  How does Bobby look?  Is he doing all right?  I would just like...  I'm being honest.  He didn't do that bad.  I would like to see Bobby lose weight a little faster than he is.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all you're going to say?  That's all I'm saying.  We worry about Bobby Kelly. 
[01:05:00]  Robert Kelly.  I had a protein bar in the bandolier in case he was malnourished at any point.  It came in handy in the airport, by the way, on the way back.  Yeah.  When he was whistling incessantly, annoying fucking people.  I never knew he was a champion.  He whistles?  He said he was a champion whistler, and he's just whistling horribly in the airport, and  people are looking.  They're getting fucking annoyed as shit.  And it's...  Film this shit, please.  Oh, I couldn't even...  No, because I was too busy trying to not even look like I'm with them.  Right.  It's 5 o'clock in the morning, by the way.  Yeah, it was 5 a.m. in the airport. 
[01:05:30]  Everyone's miserable, tired, and he's like, just loud whistling.  Oh, it was embarrassing.  So what, you guys had to do the red eye after the fights?  6 a.m.  No, 6 a.m.  Yeah.  When are the fights in?  We're going to take a little nap.  Vegas time, it ended early, obviously.  Yeah.  10, and then the press conference.  10 and stuff.  So you could get a few hours.  Sonner and distance.  If you wanted to.  But I wore the bandolier everywhere.  I wore it to dinner.  I wore it everywhere we went.  I had the bandolier.  And like when we went to film and audio record at the expo, since the bandolier can't hold 
[01:06:00]  my equipment, I had to bring a book bag, but then also the bandolier.  Yeah.  He was loaded for bear, this motherfucker.  Yeah.  We did go to dinner with Joe Rogan and a couple of his people.  Who do you have along with him?  He had a red band with him.  Red band's cool.  Red band's great.  Yeah.  And a fight doctor.  A fight doctor guy.  An actual fight doctor?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  And then we all went.  Where'd you go to dinner?  That goddamn great steak place.  Craft Steak in the MGM.  In the MGM.  What's Craft Steak?  Fuck, it's so good.  It's a steakhouse that they got in the hotel.  What is it like?  A famous chef?  No.  Who runs it?  I think it is.  I think it's one of the guys from...  Has to be.  Let me see.  Somebody will pop it up.  It's really good, though.  Yeah.  It's not Gordon Ramsay.  What makes it so good?  We've all been to a lot of steak places.  Just a fucking place. 
[01:07:00]  I had like surf and turf, and it was good, the surf and the turf.  Wait, you went surf in Vegas?  You know what?  That old gag.  They, you know, there's some places in this country you'd never order anything surf.  You know damn well they fly it in that day.  That fucking thing is getting priority.  Right.  Of course it is.  And it's Vegas.  In the fucking co-pilot seat.  That lobster.  Right.  Yeah.  Really good.  They get their lobster before Boston does from Maine.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Maine goes, fuck Boston.  We got to get lobster to Vegas first. 
[01:07:30]  Getting a real quick jet.  Yeah.  Wing it on over there.  You know it's good.  Yeah.  Really, really good.  So we went to dinner, and then I guess somebody just brought up real casually, hey, Dice is  playing here in Vegas.  I was like, oh, and Rogan's just like, you know, always the fucking, the animal.  Let's go.  Let's go see him.  Dice once said to me, he goes, hey, if you're in town, come over.  He was playing at the Riviera.  So Joe Rogan texted right there, and within seconds, Dice got back to him. 
[01:08:00]  All caps.  He was like, come by, bring you whoever you want.  And so we went over to, hey, asshole face.  He actually said that.  We went over to the Riviera, where he's playing.  And wow, if that ain't stepping into a fucking time machine.  Really?  Why?  Because everywhere else we have been, they kind of upgraded things and stuff.  Their casinos.  This is just the epitome of old Vegas. 
[01:08:30]  And by old Vegas, I especially mean the waitresses walking around.  They were, we laugh at some of the other waitresses, like at the Trop in Atlantic City  and stuff like that.  I've never seen older waitresses.  And I'm not kidding.  Waitresses should be young and hot.  Fuck that PC shit.  Dude, they looked like Sandy Cain in waitress uniform.  Oh, please.  It was that bad.  And then the casino, you walk through this, zero energy. 
[01:09:00]  Like that vibe of a casino.  Is there just a sadness in the air?  A sadness hung in the air with the cigarette smoke.  And you know people are losing a lot of money, but there's glitz and glam.  Yes.  And you feel the energy and the excitement.  And then...  Yes, there's an energy.  There was no energy.  Just sadness in the air.  It was just sadness.  And just like...  They should allow smoking there.  Like just people, it's slot machines on their fucking hover rounds and wheelchairs 
[01:09:30]  and just pulling that lever, hoping for the dream.  And it will never come.  You don't think the dream ever comes for most people?  Oh, it was just...  We had to ask one of the waitresses where the theater was, and she was just old.  No clue.  But Dice was in his element?  Oh, was Dice ever.  We went up there to the place he was working.  Unbelievable. 
[01:10:00]  He was fucking hilarious.  And we were laughing, so I'd look over at Sam, and Sam had this face on after Dice  would deliver some of his jokes, like, what's he doing?  What's wrong with you, Sam?  He's just...  Why don't you like Dice?  I love Dice, but that's why he's funny.  No, what's going on in your head?  You're usually very honest.  Let's go.  He starts doing jokes because his premises couldn't happen.  They don't...  What, like licking a girl's asshole in line at the bank?  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  That could happen.  He does this whole bit that I don't want to give away about at board games.  Yeah.  It's just, like, the most insane, ridiculous joke.  Why?  Because all of a sudden, the place he is, what he's doing with these women...  He's got enough material.  He's not really doing this, I don't think.  Right.  But it's hilarious, especially in the way he just treats some of the people in the audience.  It was great.  He threw somebody out two minutes into the show.  Two minutes.  Two minutes into the show, a guy was being escorted out of the fucking place.  Why?  What did the guy do?  He was drunk. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, chatting back a little bit.  Oh.  And he was being a little chatty back, and, you know...  Dice walked on stage.  He lost...  Excuse me.  He looks really good.  Oh, yeah.  He's thin.  And he lost a lot of weight.  He was thin here.  Yeah, but he looks thinner.  Yeah.  Even thinner.  Wow.  And he was wearing fucking baby boy long shorts and high black socks.  He was dressed like a fucking British child.  Yeah.  His pants were fucking retarded.  They were like little, little jeans.  They came up to...  How much does he weigh?  Just below his knees or something? 
[01:11:30]  If you had to guess, how much does he weigh?  I don't know how to do weight.  I really...  I'm a terrible judge.  I don't know what he was before.  I think he's only lost 40 pounds.  He looks really good.  Good for dice.  He's over at the Riv, and I think he's there all the time.  Yeah.  And that...  Let me tell you something.  It's an old school place.  Oh, yeah.  What a vibe.  What a vibe in that comedy place, though, man.  What a fucking vibe.  Yeah.  It's not the club, but the theater above it.  It's an amazing place to perform.  It doesn't have like this new shitty...  It has an old school...  Comedy club. 
[01:12:00]  Comedy club feels.  Great.  Yeah.  Really, really goddamn funny.  I mean, dice just going off.  And we were laughing so hard at just him.  I look over, and Rogan's face is like red.  He's just...  And you hear Rogan's like going...  Just screaming, laughing.  Joe Rogan's screaming laughter was above everything going on.  Because it was just fucking dice.  It was everything we wanted it to be.  He was so funny.  Because when we were at dinner and we wanted to go to dice, we're like, oh, it's going 
[01:12:30]  to be fun.  And you hope it would be.  You're not going to be disappointed.  It was everything we wanted it to be.  Awesome.  It was fucking rude dice.  At one point, Jimmy just turns to me and goes, he's just a fucking pig.  Got me laughing so hard because it's like, yes, he is.  He's just talking about women and fucking and this and your assholes and they're fucking  bleaching their asses.  Just classic.  That type of dice.  All new stuff, but it's like, it's classic dice. 
[01:13:00]  He had this whole thing about how gay people are made that just made no sense.  Made no sense.  What's his take on that?  Oh, it had something to do with the physiological makeup of the woman.  Yeah.  Whether, you know, you could tell if a woman is going to give birth to a, as he said,  a fig based on, you know, how she's put together.  But it was like, it was a theory that not only have I never heard anybody say, I would 
[01:13:30]  never think that anybody could possibly even think it.  Like, it just makes, it's the most ridiculous.  It was ridiculous.  It was hilarious.  Complete idiocy.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking funny though.  It was very, very enjoyable.  Really funny.  It was fun.  Yeah.  We just, did he hang out with dice a little bit?  Oh yeah.  He was happy to see us.  Yeah.  Because Rogan's so bold.  Like I'm always like, let's go backstage.  So Joe's like, come on, let's just walk.  So Rogan just walks over the stage and back.  Like he doesn't give a fuck, man.  He's really, you know, he's that guy.  So of course I followed him. 
[01:14:00]  And then he said, go out and get everybody.  You know, so we went out and Ant and Bobby, you know, Bobby had never met him.  I didn't know that.  Bobby never met Dice.  Bobby never met Dice.  So he was like nervous and wanted to meet.  And Dice, Jim was like, Jim was like, hey, Dice, can I take a picture with you and  Bob Kelly?  And Dice just goes, but I don't know him.  Who is he?  Who is he?  And Jim's like, no, but I'd like it too.  And he goes, but I don't know him.  With Dice, everything has to be a production.  Everything is a production.  And then they take the pictures. 
[01:14:30]  Then of course he's hugging Bob.  All right, now we know each other.  We took pictures.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then he gets like that.  All palsy.  It was fun, man.  It was a great time.  Fucking UFC was amazing.  They just took care of us.  How's the gambling, Ant?  I saw you tweeting about playing some cards.  Yeah, yeah.  I took a little bit of a beating right off the bat, but then I did good and I made a  few bucks.  Nothing near even being crazy.  I didn't even gamble to the point where I was mad. 
[01:15:00]  You know?  I just tossed some bucks away and then I won some back.  I did all right.  Not one of these, you know, record-setting events, but I left a winner.  One hand had me so fucking pissed off.  I get dealt a hand.  The deal has got a four showing and a down card, obviously.  It's blackjack.  And deals me a seven and a seven.  So you split that shit.  Deal is showing a four.  What am I going to do?  You have to.  Stay on 14?  No, I'm going to try to get a couple of tens, get a 17, hopefully deal a bust. 
[01:15:30]  Or maybe get something else.  So I fucking, I split them.  It gives me another, now I had a, it was a $400 bet on the original thing.  So now every time I do something, it costs another $400.  So I split to $400.  Then I get another seven.  So I got to split again, another $400.  Then she deals me a three.  So now I got to double down.  Holy shit.  Because I got a 10.  Right.  So on top of that 10, I hit a fucking, I get a 10.  On the other two cards, I get a 10 and a 10. 
[01:16:00]  So I have two 17s and a 20.  She's got four shown.  She flips over that fucking seven.  That fucking seven and then the face card for 20 fucking one.  Wow.  I was just like, how?  Wow.  Are you happy for her?  No, I was very upset.  You should be happy for her. 
[01:16:30]  At that one.  That's like clockwork though.  Four, seven, 10.  Boom.  It was.  Boom.  Yeah.  Brutality.  But I wound up making back.  I got, I finally got a good table, fun, bunch of guys that were just fun and laughing  and a dealer that was dealing some good cards.  So I was able to make some money back, but I didn't do much gambling.  Oddly enough, we went to the pool a lot.  Nice.  They got this pool complex now at the MGM.  That's fucking amazing. 
[01:17:00]  You think you were in Atlantis in the Bahamas.  To the middle of the fucking desert.  And there's just a shitload of pools.  I actually didn't go to the pool at all.  Was it nice?  It's a complex of pools.  It's like a shitload of different pools in the grand pool area.  Are they all connected though, sort of?  No, but they're all in the same complex.  If you walk around.  You know how Atlantis has all those sidewalks and stairs and things all over, places to  walk and plants and lights and music?  Like, that's what they got now.  And then around the whole thing, they got this lazy river thing going on where you get 
[01:17:30]  the tube and you're fucking sitting there and grab a beer and just lazy river your ass  right around a few laps.  And then I wound up getting a cabana.  Cabana for me and the young lady.  And sat in the cabana.  Nice.  How much does the cabana cost?  It's like, well, you reserve it the day before and then you have like an $800 minimum for the food. 
[01:18:00]  So then they just bring your shit.  And I was like, ah, bring me some cracked crab, please.  Sam, did you enjoy your cabana, Sam?  Oh.  I was not poolside.  Oh.  I was getting some Stein gloves for Norton.  And making sure Bobby had enough gum, mints, and cough drops.  No.  These guys were working.  They were doing too busy.  We spent all day Friday doing audio.  We did a lot of audio Friday. 
[01:18:30]  Did the special air?  Yes, it did.  It was on Saturday.  It was great.  And the special turned out great because we got so many fighters.  We got all the audio on Friday and then I stayed up late Friday night editing it  and then FTPing it back here.  And Sal was in here on Saturday.  That's amazing.  Nice.  Yeah, that actually worked.  I thought we were all just the guys hanging out in the casino while Ant was gambling.  And me and Jim and Bob, we were kind of just watching him at his table at one point.  We were all just laughing together.  And then the guy in charge of things comes over and he points to me and he goes, son, can I see your ID, please? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, that was funny.  Carded.  Yeah.  Sam got carded.  Aw.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  And we did Saturday and Sam walked around with Bobby who became a part of a chip video,  which normally I don't have any, but I dressed a little different.  I wanted to UFC it up for the chip video.  Can I see the video?  It's not up yet.  It'll be up.  I'm going to edit it this afternoon.  All right.  Back to the cabana.  I didn't mean that.  Yeah.  No, no.  It was just, it was amazing.  It was great.  Like this, that whole pool complex is amazing. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And it really is.  When you think about it, it's like without water, without a constant influx of water into  this town, it just turns into a desert in a week.  It would be done.  Everything would be dead.  It was 110 degrees.  I went outside at like 2.30 in the morning and it was as if the sun was beating on you  at noon.  It was still a hundred degrees at 2.30 in the morning.  It's still blazing fucking hot.  It was just as bad back home here. 
[01:20:00]  But we had a dry heat.  I think the dry heat's way better.  Oh, it is.  Obviously.  It's the dry heat.  Somebody was commenting though on dry heat and said, yeah, put your head in an oven.  That's a dry heat too.  Yeah.  Not the best time of year to go to Vegas, but you guys still had a good time.  Yeah.  You just stay inside.  The air conditioning is nice.  But you know what?  When you're at that whole pool thing, you just jump in the pool, you get out, and it's  nice and cool for a little while. 
[01:20:30]  And then that's why you got to get the cabana because they got the umbrellas by the lounge  chairs and then you could hang back.  You're not in this baking sun.  I never want to afford the cabanas.  Fuck it.  That's how I roll, bitches.  But you're trying to sell it like the average person could just get a cabana.  Well, you know what?  If you're going to go to Vegas, you know, what the fuck?  Are you going there to save money?  And you do spend that gambling.  Spend.  Get that economy going, people.  Spend.  Spend, spend, spend.  How were the flights?  Why did you have to? 
[01:21:00]  Going there.  Who had the problem?  Everyone?  Well, I don't know who couldn't have some sort of a problem with United Airlines.  You don't like United?  Let me tell you something.  On the way there, we took Virgin American.  Oh, I didn't.  We flew Continental.  I mean, I've done the Virgin American.  With the sleeper seats.  It's fucking great.  It's the only way to fucking fly.  It's fucking great. 
[01:21:30]  First of all, you walk in.  Holy shit.  This plane still had like the price tag on it.  Really?  Brandy new.  Brandy new.  Brandy new plane.  Did you have the sleeper seats?  Yes.  With the pillows and the blankets.  You're in your own pod.  Pillows, blank.  It was fucking fantastic.  You wake up and go, what?  I'm in Vegas?  It was fantastic.  I had that once.  It's amazing.  They got some nice music playing.  Right.  And the lights over the windows, like there's a strip where the subdued lighting is in there, 
[01:22:00]  was like purplish pink.  You feel like you're in a spa.  Yes.  Everything's just...  And then, you know what?  You're not sitting in front of a bulkhead either.  It's a glass like half wall that looks forward.  So you're not like just staring at a wall.  Mm-hmm.  Personal entertainment systems for every seat in there.  And, you know, first class.  Thank you.  Oh, no wonder.  Oh, see?  It was...  Sam, you didn't fly first class?  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  I didn't.  I was like, how could they have 20 rows of sleeper seats?  It was great.  Yeah.  Great.  That's an experience.  It really is.  And I couldn't have had a better flight.  The service, fantastic.  The flight attendants were...  They were good.  They were cordial, smiling.  Then the flight back.  A little different?  United slash Continental clusterfuck that they put together. 
[01:23:00]  Where the second United took over Continental,  they did away with those pesky things like pillows, blankets,  and any creature comfort you might want on a fucking flight across the country.  So, uh...  No blankets?  No.  What's that about?  They might have them if you ask, but no pillows.  Why?  Well, they said it was after the swine flu, or bird flu, or whatever, for hygiene.  That's full of shit.  Shut the fuck up.  They just didn't want to deal with that.  They just didn't want to fucking deal with it.  Lion sacks.  Lion sacks of shit. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, so, uh...  I just start getting an inkling when I walk into the plane,  and I always kind of look to the left and look at the flight deck, you know?  And I'm seeing instrumentation on there that fucking Lucky Lindy must have used.  We were on an old fucking plane.  That's the worst feeling.  Old plane.  And, uh...  They always say how flying's safe, but, you know, let's be honest,  the ones that do go down...  Look, the older the plane, the more shit's been replaced on it and fixed and everything else. 
[01:24:00]  And, you know, we start patching shit together.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, so it was really old, and, um, so we, we, we take our seats,  and I'm looking like, what the fuck is this?  Are you in first class?  Yeah.  I'm right there on row one, so I got the bulkhead seat, which, again,  Virgin Atlantic had a great, uh, bulkhead seat.  I had no problem with that.  There's, it's like, it's, it's like an inch from your face.  You're right there with the wall.  Well, I couldn't even stretch my legs out. 
[01:24:30]  And your legs, you're, you're, it's, it's...  And you're in first class.  Look, look.  Right.  I know people are going to be like, aw, aw, aw, but it's, I'm paying for first class.  So what?  I wanted what I was paying for.  So did they, uh, just squeeze another first class seat in there?  I don't know what these cocksuckers did.  It sounds like they should have just got rid of that seat and spread out the rest of first class.  Exactly.  I don't know what these pigs did, but, uh, but, uh, you know what?  If you're flying first class and you're paying top dollar, you want consistency. 
[01:25:00]  The problem I have with first class and airlines is there's no, there's no criteria for it.  One time you'll pay money, go into first class, you'll have a sleeper seat, great fucking plane, new equipment.  It's, it's fantastic.  Then you pay the same amount of money.  You get a seat that's barely any better than a coach seat.  This didn't have a leg thing or any, not even a foot rest or anything.  It just went back as much as any other seat would go back.  And again, look, motherfuckers, I know I'm bitching about first class. 
[01:25:30]  I know some of you cocksuckers can't understand.  But it sounds like you weren't in a first class seat.  Right.  It, it, the whole first class section.  So you kind of wasted your money there.  It was, it was a cushy, it was a cushioned seat.  That's pretty much the only difference.  The, the problem I had with it is, uh, it's just mostly the leg room.  Like the fact that you couldn't stretch your legs so that a bulkhead wall, um, I used to,  I used to, I used to, no, everyone remembers how I fought for Continental and like, I'm telling 
[01:26:00]  you, they're, they're awful now.  And the people who work for them are terrible.  Terrible.  They're fucking terrible.  The flight crews are shit.  You turned us all on to Continental.  So where are we going next?  They're just not nice to you.  You fly enough to know.  We had, uh, every time I fly on, on Continental now, honestly, every time, even if I don't  have the interaction, I watch one of their employees being cunty to someone going out.  Ant wasn't on the flight going out.  We watched, I got yelled at, uh, we watched a woman. 
[01:26:30]  She was working in the lounge area.  Uh, she looked like Francine actually with more hair and, uh, she was just being cunty  to customers.  And I watched the whole interaction.  It wasn't like I walked in on the middle of something.  I was watching people from the beginning of their interaction with her.  And she was just a fucking bitch.  She wasn't pleasant.  She wasn't helpful.  She was just kind of snapping at people.  So we get on the plane and, um, I go to the bathroom and I get out and I'm just taking 
[01:27:00]  something down.  I have a mouth guard I use so I start to sleep.  And she, and she happens to be on the plane now for whatever reason.  She, and she goes, uh, I need you to sit down so I can close the door.  And I'm like, I made an immediate decision because I mumbled as she walked away.  Like you didn't have to yell your fucking cunt.  I mumbled it and I didn't say it loud because I knew what I wanted to say would have gotten  me thrown off.  You get thrown off in a second.  Now they got you held hostage, but she didn't say, Hey, could you please sit?  We're closing the door.  I need you to sit so I can, like she had told me five times. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  And I had just ignored her.  And I'm like, I just watched this fucking bitch being awful to people and rush.  It's like, if you don't like your job and I should take our own advice, but it's like  just do something else then.  Like don't sit there and attack everybody who's, I watch people asking her legitimate  questions and she's just a bitch, just a fucking awful rotten bitch who didn't want  to be dealing with the public who should is not good at her job. 
[01:28:00]  Who could you complain to?  Oh, nobody over there.  You can go to their customer service, but they don't care because they're all fellow  employees.  You know who I complain to?  The people at Virgin American who will get my fucking business anytime before fucking  United ever gets it.  There's no fucking reason.  And then I caught shit from the fucking flying waitress on the trip back on the dumb United  flight.  You know what?  I'm sitting there. 
[01:28:30]  It's a, you know, me, my girls sitting next to me and stuff and, and, and we're, we're,  we're yapping, you know, and they got that safety thing going on.  I know.  And I'm not, I'm not being, you know, excessively loud.  We're not, you know, just kind of talking, but that safety thing is garbage.  And, and everyone is still, everyone has seen it.  Right.  Don't worry about it.  Because if a plane's going down, no one's going to remember the safety speech.  Don't worry about it.  They're going to be yelling and screaming and trying to save their own lives.  I know the whole thing.  I know the whole thing by heart. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  So, uh, she turns to me and goes, she goes, I need you to be quiet for that.  And okay, I'm fine with that.  I didn't even mind that.  That wasn't the cunty part.  So I'm like, all right, I'm looking and watching it.  Then later on, she, after it's over, she kneels down next to me and goes, where I'm from, uh, you, you don't mess with your, uh, waitress or, or bartender.  Like, like, hey, I'm not going to get you your shit because you were fucking talking during my presentation. 
[01:29:30]  Holy fuck.  And she looked like Chip, the lady.  Yeah, she really did.  She looked like Chip.  You're paying for this.  Yeah, and I'm paying for it.  It's first class, shit seat, and she's giving me crap.  Did she give you your drinks?  She's damn well better, I have, yeah.  But she made them wait last before she went to the food thing.  She started from the back.  Yes, she did.  Wow, you showed him.  That fucking bitch.  But also, I forgot to mention, we were boarding the plane in Newark.  We were going to Vegas. 
[01:30:00]  I flew first, but, you know, the company flew me first.  And Sam, they flew coach.  But one of the things is I wanted to bring him on with us because he, um.  Well, it's a courtesy.  It's a courtesy, and you're allowed to bring your traveling companion on the plane with you.  Right, right.  But this way, Sam wouldn't have to wait to put his bags up and stuff.  So, Anthony Bourdain was actually on the flight.  I didn't know it until I was on the plane.  And we were pretending not to notice each other.  And, um.  Is that true? 
[01:30:30]  Of course.  It's why, it's by the, it's, uh.  Wait, wait, explain that.  Oh, hold on a second.  Okay.  So, we're getting on the plane, and Bobby, Bobby, Bobby and I were sitting together.  And so they had, we had Sam come in line, like, come on with us.  And the woman, the woman told, we don't allow that anymore.  That, the bitch who looks like Francine said, we don't allow that anymore.  So, basically, if you're flying first, you're not allowed to bring your travel companion on.  You're supposed to just leave them out and allow them.  That's just another dumb courtesy that was nice.  But, he came on, and so when we were leaving Vegas, I asked the people, can we bring him on? 
[01:31:00]  Right.  And they're like, yeah, you can still do that.  So, basically, another example of how that woman in Newark just didn't know her job.  Didn't know her shit.  And we're just being a bitch.  Just being a fucking bitch for no reason.  Probably knew her job and kind of likes the power thing.  But she lied.  She said that we weren't allowed to do something we were allowed to do.  Well, people lie all the time in their jobs because they like the power trip.  What a bitch.  So, I didn't know Bourdain was even on the flight, to be honest with you.  He was sitting directly in front of us.  I had no idea it was him.  I'm surprised by that. 
[01:31:30]  Your radar is always up for celebrities.  Yeah, but then I'm going to the bathroom.  I saw him look up and then look down real quick.  I'm like, oh, okay.  But people always say to you, why don't you talk to these guys?  That's why.  He's fine.  He's a big UFC guy.  He doesn't have any reason to be fucking friendly to me.  But not even an acknowledgement that he knew I was.  It's like, I know.  That's why I get pictures with these guys and then fucking ignore them.  Because any interaction you have with them is a fucking lie.  It's not a real.  He was on the show.  We had a nice time chit-chatting. 
[01:32:00]  And again, that's where it ends.  Right there.  It begins and ends right there.  There's no real.  Can actually be made.  That's why I look at them like that.  Right.  Because we had a good time.  We chit-chat.  We're promoting his book.  And not even a, hey man, how are you?  Well, Mark Wahlberg remembered us.  And, oh, that's right.  But it's like a little silly thing like that.  Like, that was just, you know what?  That's what it is.  Right.  So we have to interview Bourdain in Comic-Con when we go, I think. 
[01:32:30]  I guess.  So bring it up.  Of course I will.  Maybe he's just shy.  Maybe he's not shy.  He's just, you know, please.  Please.  He didn't give a fuck.  And that's, again, I don't hate the guy.  So what?  I didn't say hi either.  But I consciously saw him look up and act like he did.  Oh, boy.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that was it.  And I was able to get Bobby pretty good, though, on the Continental flight.  I asked the stewardess if she had the big seatbelt extenders. 
[01:33:00]  I leaned over.  I pointed.  I go, Bobby.  I go, excuse me.  Excuse me.  Do you have, and I pointed at Bobby.  I go, do you have the seatbelt extenders?  Because I think he needs.  He goes, I got it.  I clipped it.  It's all pissed.  Bobby is a fucking, he's a force to be reckoned with.  Like, at the UFC, I was sitting next to him.  And I think he thinks he's skinny Bobby because he leans over to talk to you. 
[01:33:30]  Now, you've got to realize where a head is on someone's body.  It's right in the middle.  You know?  Center line.  And you've got all this other real estate, which is your body.  So when you lean over to talk to somebody in your chair and you're leaning your head  over, by the time your head gets close enough to the other person's head, your body has  been there for a while now.  You know?  He was literally knocking me out of my chair.  To lean over to say something to you.  To lean over to talk to me.  And he's just, he's a big guy. 
[01:34:00]  And he doesn't know his own strength.  He was, he'd try to tap me, like, to say, hey, check this out.  And it was like I was being backhanded, like a spinning back fist to my chest every time.  Like Spider-Man?  Yes.  So the people that have seen Spider-Man.  He didn't know his own strength.  And he's next to me, too.  Bobby's between me and Ant.  And I have my camera thing on my side, like I always do.  So I kept sitting down on my camera thing on my side.  It was like a gun.  Kept bumping into Bobby.  He goes, dude, you know, your camera keeps hitting me.  And I'm, he's like, you should move it. 
[01:34:30]  And I'm like, the camera's not the problem.  Exactly.  Anyone else sitting there, there wouldn't be an issue.  You're the first person I've ever hit with a camera.  What does that tell you?  The thing about Bobby, you know, he's easy to goof on.  But man, you go too far, he will knock your head off your fucking body.  Yeah, Bobby's a fucking psycho.  Yes.  You know?  And you don't really know where that line is.  The one thing that is going to just make him go, I'm going to now rip your fucking head off.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that fight, did you see the fight, dude?  I did, yes.  I wish it went a little longer, but it was still a great fight, man.  Fuck, I thought the first, after the first.  People were talking about the knee.  The knee was perfectly legal.  A lot of people saying it wasn't legal.  They're dumb.  They just don't know, right?  They're dummies.  Because it looked like it hit him right in the chest.  Yeah.  It was absolutely a legal knee.  Rogan said it.  I've seen it on replay.  It was, it was legal.  Right.  I saw it.  Yep.  Um, it was a completely legal fucking knee in the chest.  The first round, it was only two rounds for non-UFC fans who hate when we talk fight talk. 
[01:35:30]  Um, the energy of fucking that fight starting, man.  Yeah, yeah, that was huge.  I don't think I've ever felt that energized in a public place before my life.  Well, I don't think we've seen a buildup like, uh, like this fight in a long time, right?  No, this was the biggest one.  I mean, the UFC knows how to build up their fights, but this one was way over the top.  Dude, the biggest one in their history.  I think so.  And it was, Silva's, uh, unbeatable, huh? 
[01:36:00]  It seems that way, man.  Who the fuck is he going to fight next?  Um, I'm going to guess somebody is going to come down from light heavyweight to fight him.  It's, I don't know.  What's the, uh, weight difference between him and Jon Jones?  20 pounds, but he won't go up to fight Jones.  He wouldn't do it.  And Jones will come down.  I mean, obviously.  Jones might, but he wouldn't go up.  He's 38.  Can't they meet in the middle somewhere and just make, create some weird fucking, I don't  know.  I think they can do that, but I don't think, I don't know.  Could you imagine a Jon Jones, Anderson Silva fight?  It would be awesome.  It would be awesome.  I think Jones would beat him, though. 
[01:36:30]  He's just a bigger guy.  But, uh, so the first round, it looked like it was going to be the same thing all over  again.  He had Anderson right on the ground, Chael.  He wasn't hurting him, though, but he was dominating him on the ground.  Yep.  And then in round two, he came out, and there was a really weird moment where there was, you  Silva threw a couple, it looked like they tried to take each other down, and nobody  went down.  And then Anderson hit him with a couple of punches, hard shots, and then it just clicked.  It was a weird switch where all of a sudden he was dominating the fight. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, you just knew it was his fight.  You knew it was his fight.  And he threw a couple of really hard shots, and, uh, and Chael did a spinning back fist  and missed and fell.  And then Anderson, that's when Anderson jumped down and drove that knee into his chest.  And, uh, and Chael did get up again, but then Anderson knocked him down, I think, with  a right and began pounding him.  When he started pounding his face.  And they stopped the fight.  But they should have stopped it because, uh, then Chael didn't move for a few seconds  after, I think.  Um, it was a good stop. 
[01:37:30]  It was done.  That was done.  And, and, uh, the knee was not illegal.  And at the press conference after, anyone who hates Chael Sonnen, the guy is not a fucking  whiner.  He is not a baby.  Because there was a thing where, like, I guess Anderson had grabbed his shorts for a second,  and people were asking about, that's illegal.  And he goes, ah, he grabs my shorts, I grab his shorts.  It's a fight.  He goes, he grabs my shorts this time, I'll grab somebody else's shorts.  What goes around comes around.  And then they go, what about the illegal knee? 
[01:38:00]  He goes, I'll have to watch it again, but I don't like this whole illegal thing.  He goes, I like it when there was no weight classes.  It's a fight.  You know, Chael is not a fucking baby, man.  He lost.  He gave Anderson respect.  He goes, he's just a true champ.  A true champion.  The better man won.  He really fucking said the things, like, he was a no bullshit guy when he lost.  I know a lot of people hate Chael Sonnen, but he was a no bullshit guy.  He didn't baby about it, and he didn't cry about the knee, which he shouldn't have. 
[01:38:30]  It was a legal knee, but he didn't even try to run with that.  I'm sure he knows where the knee landed.  Yeah, he took it.  Yeah, I'll tell you where it hit.  And Anderson, in that second round, really dominated him.  And the fight before that was Tito Forrest, which was, you know, it was Tito's last fight.  And he was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame that day.  And I couldn't really, you know, again, I thought Tito won, but a lot of people would have thought Forrest won.  A lot of people thought Forrest won. 
[01:39:00]  Tito knocked him on his ass a couple of times.  Yeah, but Forrest won by decision.  All three judges.  So I guess I saw it.  Maybe I saw it wrong, but I thought Tito had won.  But again, that's whatever, because I kind of like Tito a little bit better.  And Forrest constantly had energy, even though both of them looked like they were, you know, dying at the end.  But he was at least on his toes and moving around.  And Tito was like lumbering.  Just fucking...  Yeah, he looked a little gassed.  Yeah, yeah.  But after the fight, I guess Forrest wasn't happy with his performance and he ran out of the ring again. 
[01:39:30]  Like he did in fucking Philly.  Remember that?  What is he doing?  And Dana...  Then all of a sudden you see Forrest coming back, and it turns out Dana had chased him down.  Oh shit, get your fucking ass.  And screamed, get the fuck back in the ring, or whatever it was he yelled.  But when you go to those press cops...  Why does he do that?  But then at the end, and then this is fucking...  I understand one time, but...  Again.  And this is Tito's last fight.  Right.  So after the fight's over, and then Forrest comes back in the ring, he takes the mic and interviews him. 
[01:40:00]  Instead of letting Rogan do it.  Yeah, that was so weird.  And he goes, do you think you were gassed at the end because you were doing autographs today?  And I guess that really pissed Tito off, because he had started with Rogan years ago, and he wanted it to...  So the press conference is happening, and Tito's complaining about this.  And Forrest kind of came in late, and then sat down and just apologized.  I said, look, I'm really truly sorry for that.  Dana was pissed at Forrest, too, because he started the press conference, and like half the fighters were there, and a couple weren't there yet. 
[01:40:30]  And he was like, you know, these guys are here.  It was a great night of fights.  They did great.  Anderson is on the way.  He's doing some interviews in a locker room, and I don't know, Forrest probably ran home at this point.  So what's the first question?  Yeah, he was furious.  And he talks about that stuff really honestly, and he fucking bashed at these guys when they don't do the right thing.  It was just totally uncalled for for Forrest to do that.  But, you know, all in all, it was a very fun night.  Yeah.  Fuck, was it a fun night?  Very cool.  We should take a break and get into Chip Chipperson at the UFC Fan Expo. 
[01:41:00]  I want to hear some of that.  Chip.  I haven't heard any of this.  What's about Sam?  Chip was in rare form for the entire Vegas trip.  He had a lot of ideas for different businesses where he could put comedy clubs.  It had to be the entire Vegas trip.  The entire.  It had to be the entire.  The entire thing.  Chip was noticing spots where he could put comedy clubs.  The hallway was one, and he could then charge people for going in the hallway, and he would just perform himself. 
[01:41:30]  What, that giant hallway?  Yeah, that long walk back to the hotel.  Holy fuck.  Let me tell you something about the MGM.  Wow.  We were staying at the Signature Towers, and there's a tunnel, or kind of hallway, whatever the fuck you want to call it, from there to the main MGM hotel.  You know, the big, iconic green building.  It was the longest fucking walk ever.  Yeah.  Every time.  What a pain in the ass.  Are the towers new?  Yeah.  Since we've been out there?  They were built as condos.  I remember that.  But they didn't sell, so they're using them as the MGM. 
[01:42:00]  They might have been built as hotel condos.  Kenny warned us, though, but we didn't care.  We were like, you know, it's not a big deal.  It was, and I think that's why I didn't gamble as much, because the pain in the ass walk to the casino, it's not like the hotel you're staying, you just take the elevator down, and you know, when the elevator opens on the lobby, you're hearing, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  It was a long fucking walk.  And a couple of places in the big hallway, they got them, but you're walking most of the time, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  I'm walking.  It's a long-ass fucking walk.  I'm walking.  And they try to mix it up by putting a bunch of bends and turns in it, so you're not just looking at a tunnel that amounts to, like, the Lincoln Tunnel.  How far is it?  So they bend a little.  How far would you say that is?  I believe.  I mean, if you had to guess, whatever, yeah.  They were saying 10 minutes.  I think it was a little shorter than 10 minutes, but it was still like.  It was longer than five.  They're saying it's a 10-minute walk?  I think it's probably seven to eight minutes.  Yeah.  But that's a long walk. 
[01:43:00]  A hallway.  That's at least a half a mile.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was around.  That's at least a half a mile if it's seven or eight minutes.  When you looked out at the MGM building from the towers, you'd look and go, that is fucking far.  How about the average walk?  Look that up online.  We could do some math here.  Oh, how long?  I'll tell you.  What speed do you walk at?  Yeah, what's the average speed you walk at?  It was.  How far do you walk?  Four miles an hour. 
[01:43:30]  What?  Kenny says four miles an hour.  All right, so if you're doing four miles an hour for seven minutes.  I'm smart.  All right, so then it's half a mile.  Is that it?  More or less, yeah.  Because four.  Wait, what did he say?  Four miles an hour.  Four miles an hour.  So that's.  So you said 15.  That's four hours.  Say seven minutes.  Yeah, so 15 minutes would be a mile.  Right.  And then you said seven or eight.  So, yeah, half a mile.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Half a mile.  Half a mile.  Half a mile away.  And you have to walk back, too.  So every time you leave your room, it's a mile.  It's a mile.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  They should figure out an easier way to get you there.  We did that so many times.  They had them moving walkways.  What about the tram?  Isn't the tram right outside that hotel?  There wasn't.  But it takes you to a place.  You had to get to the hotel first, the MGM.  How do they sell that, that you're in one of these towers and you're at the MGM?  Well, they let you know where you are.  I mean, you know that you have a walk.  In an average weekend, you're leaving your room four or five. 
[01:44:30]  Wow, you're talking like.  We walked a lot.  I must have done that walk a thousand times.  I didn't mind it, though.  Honestly, I would prefer to stay in the MGM, but I wanted the newer towers.  Well, what sucks about that, when you leave your room, you're committing to be gone for the day.  You know when you're like.  Exactly.  Oh, wait.  I forgot something in my room.  You can just quickly go back upstairs or whatever.  You got to make sure you got all your shit.  And you got to make sure you're ready to leave.  And you got to make sure you're ready to go.  Oh, yeah.  Don't forget anything because you don't want to go back. 
[01:45:00]  We'd easily make the trip.  Oh, they got to figure that out.  Two, three, four times a day.  It don't make no sense.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Whoa, what's that about?  Does that mean we should break?  Chip was on quite a roll this weekend.  Well, I can't wait.  We got audio of Chip at the UFC Fan Expo.  We're going to play next for everyone.  These are Chip's interviews.  He did some observational stuff, too, but that was more visual.  Right.  The interviews, however, we can definitely share with the radio audience. 
[01:45:30]  Will they play audio-wise?  I believe they will.  I was listening to them this morning.  Were you cracking up?  Yeah, I was.  Okay.  Okay.

[01:47:30]  Yes, we are live. 
[01:48:00]  Yes, we are live.  You went out on The Worst Of?  As the sweeper would have indicated.  Oh, E-Rock.  How was your break, E-Rock?  What did you do?  I hung out at my house the whole time.  It was great.  It just makes me laugh every time because he's just a consumer.  I watched movies.  And the best way to consume is to just stay home.  Just stay home. 
[01:48:30]  You watched movies?  Sorry, Gary.  I watched movies.  What kind of movies?  I ran through the Mission Impossible set.  I've never seen him before.  Saw that.  Why are you shaking your head, Sam?  The Women in Black.  He just does nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah, I would understand.  He just does nothing.  I worked on The House.  I played with Legos.  I played with Legos, he says.  I haven't slept in two weeks.  I'm with Sam on this one.  Running through the whole Mission Impossible thing, that sounds like an activity for, I don't 
[01:49:00]  know, like February.  Yeah, like you have to be on a shitty, cold weekend.  Snowed in.  Right, but right around 4th of July, there's always so much shit going on.  He was invited.  Roland had a party.  We had people over for the 4th.  Did some grilling at the house.  Wait, who came over for the 4th?  Friends.  I would imagine you have a huge grill.  Why wouldn't he invite his friends over for the 4th? 
[01:49:30]  I didn't know about any party on the 4th.  I didn't hear about that either.  You didn't hear about it, Jim?  No.  What's up with the no invite thing?  Because I have an invite out to all of you for the housewarming that we're having this  weekend.  Why couldn't we do both?  Plus, you knew Jim and me couldn't go to the housewarming.  No.  This was sent long before you guys made those plans.  Oh, boy.  So why wouldn't you invite people you know and love?  To the 4th.  People that I don't get to see every day like I do here.  Oh, you separate your friendships. 
[01:50:00]  What's that?  That's bullshit.  That is bullshit.  Well.  All right, Iraq.  Everything's got to be a mystery.  Oh, I can't have my work friends and my personal friends.  No.  He just didn't want us acting up in front of his new friends.  Two worlds collide.  His fancy friends.  He didn't want people calling him, making fun of him.  Yep.  Apparently, you don't think Jim can behave himself in your house.  That's fine.  That's not true.  Those worlds would collide this Saturday if everyone was coming.  Yeah, but you knew he couldn't come.  No, I didn't.  You knew we were going to come.  He doesn't want to be made to look the fool in front of him because they probably have 
[01:50:30]  respect for him.  Jimmy is welcome out any time that he wants to come.  No, that any time shit doesn't work.  We've discussed it on the show.  We don't like when Ant does it.  July 1st to the 3rd or 5th on.  I'm welcome there, but not at the 4th.  You specifically did not invite Jim on the 4th.  Yeah, you got to reach out.  Reach out.  Okay, I wasn't planning on it, but all right.  You just didn't want to hang with your radio friends.  Yeah.  There were other people in my life.  I know why, too.  Why?  Because I bet you his real friends treat him very differently. 
[01:51:00]  He doesn't want the two to mix.  They respect him.  And he didn't want us to see him acting up and eating and being a fucking, just like  being at home, relaxing.  And we rag on him.  Just call him a consumer.  And his friends would be like, why is he rock?  Yeah, why are they beating him so bad?  He's got friends that would be like, holy shit, is that the Millennium Falcon Lego?  Yeah, yeah.  Whoa.  No, I don't have any friends that like that.  No, I think there's a different respect level with your other friends.  Do you think they treat him different?  Oh, absolutely. 
[01:51:30]  Do they, Eric?  Yeah, they're not making fat jokes every 10 minutes.  Wait, are they all fat?  No.  Blind?  It's every five minutes.  Blind.  How much food do you go through for your barbecue?  He does.  He probably likes to eat when he's with his personal friends quite a bit.  Oh, yeah.  And no one even notices, right?  Because they don't, yeah, they don't get...  Well, they notice, but they're too polite.  Yeah, yeah.  They know.  You think they know?  Yeah, they know.  Yeah, it's like watching somebody put shotgun bullets in his mouth.  Wow, I wonder why you weren't invited. 
[01:52:00]  Fair enough.  What kind of consuming, though?  I'm obsessed with the consuming part.  So you had to party on the 4th, and then just the rest, the Thursday, Friday, Saturday,  and Sunday, it was just Nagel time?  Oh, yeah.  Because E-Rock eats stuff I didn't even know existed, like just little treats.  Coke floats.  Coke floats, little things.  Oh, my God.  What kind of consuming?  Not fucking Coke floats.  Why do you like Coke floats?  I don't like Coke floats.  I've never drank them.  Is that like a Florida thing when you were growing up there?  Something to cool you off on a humid day? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  I wouldn't know.  As you're taking your boat to high school.  Pretty cool, huh?  All right, so you stayed home, and you just kind of watched the Mission Impossible series.  I watched movies.  I worked on the house.  And he's probably just sitting there going, you know, I don't get to do this too often,  so I'm going to take some time to relax.  It was great.  Yeah.  But why wouldn't you go outside?  I did go outside, but then, you know what? 
[01:53:00]  It was hitting 100, so fuck that.  Yeah, that's a good point.  You've got to get a pool or something, I'm thinking.  I don't have enough property for a pool.  I thought he was going to save money, but why would he save money?  No, of course not.  Iraq's done very well for himself.  What's wrong with that, Sam?  He's done very well.  You don't feel like he earned it?  What do you mean spending the weekend at home watching Mission Impossible movies and building  Legos?  I don't know.  That's his leisure.  Yeah.  He's a man of leisure.  Every week.  It's every right to do that in his downtime.  And on Twitter, apparently answering your questions about soda. 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  Jesus, did you see that?  I started, but I kept it going as long as I could.  Why is that?  He loves keeping it going.  Answering all your questions.  He is a soda expert.  Is he?  Yeah.  Soda expert.  They love him.  He knows what goes best with which ice cream.  Soda aficionado magazine.  What kind of ice cream with a Coke float?  I don't drink Coke float.  What kind of ice?  It's vanilla.  He likes just plain classic vanilla with Coke.  Really? 
[01:54:00]  Not Pepsi.  He won't do Pepsi.  You don't do Pepsi.  I hate Pepsi.  I think I do Pepsi over Coke.  I don't blame him.  Me too.  I do Pepsi over Coke.  But not with ice cream.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  Diet too?  I don't drink a lot of soda, but when I do, I think I go Pepsi over Coke, yeah.  I hate Pepsi products.  I hate them.  Why?  Because they're such fucking little, they're the Burger King of sodas.  They fucking stink.  I knew it was a personal vendetta and not actually based on the soda.  No, I'll tell you why.  I don't like the way they taste, and I hate when I go to order a Coke and they get like,  Hey, it's Pepsi products. 
[01:54:30]  How do they say that?  Or when I'm staying in like Courtyard Marriott's, because it's my favorite hotel.  And I'll be like, yeah, let me get out of here.  So, can I get a little good Diet Coke?  Hey, let me get out of the Pepsi products.  Pepsi has to go in there and fucking nudge and whore their way in.  If you don't sell Coke, we'll give you a discount.  Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.  Because we can't compete in a fair market.  If you think I'll send it, not Coke, we'll give you a discount.  Coke does the same thing.  Coke's the fucking, Coke is the.  Coke gives discounts if you don't have Pepsi.  Coke is the biggest.  Pepsi wheedles the, Pepsi fucking noodles their face in there. 
[01:55:00]  Hi, are you selling soda?  Yes, we are.  Well, if you always sell Pepsi products, we'll give you a discount.  Every, just Coke does that.  I think, although very funny, I think every fucking company does that.  Of course they do.  No, they don't.  Coke doesn't give a fuck.  They're all battling each other all the time.  Coke gives a fuck.  They don't care less if Pepsi is there.  They don't care if you sell fucking ham sandwiches or dog farts.  Why would they care if you sold Pepsi?  So you think stores that just do Coke products, it's just because, look, we know this is better. 
[01:55:30]  No, it's probably because Pepsi wants exclusives.  I'm sure Coke does the same thing, but Coke is just better.  And Pepsi is just a noise.  I hate when I go, because I've never said, can I have a Pepsi?  We all like, how many Coke products?  That is true.  You never hear that.  No, because Coke doesn't give a fuck if Pepsi's there.  Why would you?  Why would you?  I got a question for E-Rock about soda.  Yeah.  The most overrated soda.  Mountain Dew.  Oh, yeah.  He did say he was not a fan of any of the do's.  Wow.  You had an answer.  Because I have an answer. 
[01:56:00]  Everyone swears how great Mountain Dew is, and it just tastes like piss.  Sierra Mist is so fucking overrated.  Well, that's not 7-Up, of course.  That's Pepsi's answer to 7-Up.  And Sprite.  We only have Pepsi products.  Wait, is that a Pepsi product?  Pepsi comes out with shit after Coke does.  Of course they do.  Pepsi fucking stinks.  Sierra Mist is supposed to be Sprite.  Sierra Mist sucks.  Sierra Mist blows.  I had a nice, cold 7-Up last night.  Oh, how good is that?  7-Up fucking kicks ass. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, it was so goddamn good.  Where's the alcohol?  What's wrong with you?  It's not.  Got a fever?  Oh, no.  What is it?  No, 7-Up is independent.  With Dr. Pepper.  7-Up is good.  7-Up.  I thought they were a Coca-Cola product.  Mr. Pib is Coca-Cola.  No, they're distributed in certain regions.  Did you do a 7-in-7?  What's wrong with you?  7-Up.  How does 7-Up?  No alcohol.  No, no.  No, no.  What?  I was saying, I thought it was a Coca-Cola product.  No, you said you did a 7-Up last night.  It was delicious.  Oh, oh, oh.  And I got confused there.  No, no. 
[01:57:00]  Where was the other 7 part?  It was just pure.  What happened to the other 7?  Just pure.  Very hard to drink on Sundays.  After a very long flight.  After a very long fucking since Thursday.  I was pretty much...  Oh, actually, Wednesday.  Hard to drink Sundays.  Well, I guess that was a fucking tomato juice you were having there on the flight back.  I didn't say impossible.  It's amazing how you overcame that first.  No, there's nothing better than a couple of Bloody Marys when you first get on the plane  to kind of knock you out. 
[01:57:30]  You know?  Especially with that goddamn fucking United seat that wasn't first class.  And chip lady face.  And chip lady face.  She was the worst.  Oh.  And then looking over to Jim with those eye goggle things on.  God, oh, yeah.  Yeah, and your little eye patch.  I had my eye patch and I slapped my ass off.  I had a panic attack in bed last night again.  I woke up and just started slapping myself because I can't sleep.  I'm so...  It's ruining my life.  But I sleep on the plane now because I have that dumb mouth guard.  The mouth guard helps me sleep on the plane.  So why does the mouth guard help when you're in your apartment?  Because I feel like I can't breathe.  I've tried seven different apnea masks. 
[01:58:00]  I just...  It doesn't work for me.  I can't...  I'm a crazy person.  It's eventually going to end my life.  I mean, I can't...  No!  Eventually.  I had something on the soda thing.  The Sierra Mist.  Being shitty.  We don't have a...  Can we die a Coke?  We only can't...  When I hear that, I want it followed by a shotgun blast.  Fucking drives me nuts.  God, I fucking hate that.  It's like, you know, we expect peace in the Middle East. 
[01:58:30]  And these two dog shit soda companies can't get along in a fucking...  In a machine.  I hate when they won't compete with each other.  Coke does, of course, too.  It drives me fucking nuts.  They really do make those little side deals to not...  I hate them for it.  Don't deal with that.  Let us choose if your product's good.  Yeah.  I don't perform and go, yeah, I'll come on.  But that's all if you don't have Robert Kelly here.  That's a good deal.  We all work.  No.  But we all work.  You know what I mean?  It's like, if you can't compete, then get the fuck out.  Yeah.  Right.  Why the Courtyard Best Hotel? 
[01:59:00]  That's not what I was...  There was something else I wanted to say.  Because sheets bother me.  I'm such a...  Again, I'm a crazy person when I sleep.  I love them.  Two holes up.  But I sleep better in Courtyard by Marriott for whatever reason.  For me, it just works.  It's not the best hotel.  But when we were in Rochester, I left a five-star fucking spa to go to the Courtyard by Marriott.  And I slept like a baby.  I think I found a new hotel.  The Hampton...  What are they called?  Hampton Inns are okay, too.  Holy fuck, man.  Because I was doing a lot of driving and, you know, I had to stop in the middle of my long drives for the night. 
[01:59:30]  And we found a Hampton Inn.  Wow.  Why do you fly up?  Why would you drive up?  It's six hours.  But that's a whole night that you waste in a hotel.  It's all right, though.  It's all right.  Oh, no.  I would never do that.  I mean, I think, to answer your question, it's not far enough to fly for me.  Oh, okay.  I could do the drive.  Six hours is beyond my limit.  Five hours.  Is it really?  Five hours.  Like, D.C.  The D.C. market is my cutoff. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Because, again, I spent the first ten years of my career going.  And you don't have a kid.  It's just easy to just throw everybody in the car and go.  Yeah, I guess so.  Than the airport, right.  Although, you know, we've done well with the flying with the kid.  But you never know when that's going to turn.  But we found a Hampton Inn.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, they're not bad.  That's a comfortable bed.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they say the duvet's been washed and everything.  They put a little fucking post-it right above the bed.  Like, don't worry.  I like that.  There's no cum on our duvets is basically what they were trying to tell me.  That's pretty much what they are telling you.  They are telling you that. 
[02:00:30]  We washed all the jizz off your duvet.  Right.  It's like, look, if we're going to have duvets in the Hampton Inn, we don't want them thrown on the floor  because you're assuming that they're filled with jizz.  So the post-it was there saying the duvet has been washed for your convenience or something like that.  That's nice.  For your comfort.  And it was just weird that there was a post-it above the bed telling us that.  That's smart.  They know the reputation of the duvet.  That's what it's got to be.  But, man, everything was soft and nice.  Yeah, those are good.  Hampton Inn's.  Coil by Marriott for me, whatever reason, is comfortable. 
[02:01:00]  The air conditioners are freezing.  I just sleep.  The smell of the room.  There's something about the products they use where the smell of the room is just comfortable for me.  You don't feel like you're in a hotel room.  I feel comforted and sleepy.  I like that smell.  And tired.  Yeah, it smells clean.  It smells like home.  Yeah.  I wish I had stories.  I went to Sotus Bay and hung out with Wheeze and the gang.  We just chilled.  Yeah.  I wish I had a real story for you guys.  Usually we come back with good stories, but we just chilled, man. 
[02:01:30]  It was just nice up there doing our little boat trips where we go.  I was telling Aunt, we go maybe a mile an hour with a lot of wine.  Just putting with some wine.  But we talked about this because we all have the friend that has this.  I do have one quick story.  We all have that one friend that has their damn stupid speedboat,  and it's only fun for him while you're holding on for dear life.  You're going a thousand miles an hour.  As they're going a thousand miles because they want to show how big their dicks are.  And you're like, you can't talk to anyone.  You're like, is this thing going to flip over? 
[02:02:00]  So we get in and we just putz around the whole bay with wine and tunes and good talk.  Sun going down.  How big is the bay?  It's pretty big.  I don't know how big.  But I mean, I think lake.  It's bigger than a lake, though, right?  Yeah, it's bigger than a lot of lakes, sure.  Yeah, it's big.  I don't know.  I mean, you could putt around for easily two or three hours.  How many people on the boat?  You know, one day we had six.  The other day we had like four with my kids, so five, you know. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, it's a real...  I'm thinking it's a...  And then you stop over at these unbelievable houses and have dinner.  Everyone knows everyone.  It's really nice.  Oh, you just stopped off and ate with people?  Yeah, people we met last time.  What?  Well, now we feel like we're the best of friends.  How does that work?  How does it work?  You've got to leave New York, and then it works.  Oh, yeah?  I was telling these people, like, they're like, oh, my God, it's good to see you again.  I'm like, I spent an hour with you last time I was up.  But they feel like we're best friends now.  And I go, do you realize I've lived in a building for four years in Manhattan, and I don't have these connections I have up there from meeting people for a couple hours? 
[02:03:00]  Really?  How weird is that?  I think the whole thing's weird.  You do?  Yeah.  They're just nicer up there.  Maybe it's the long winters.  It keeps everyone on their toes, like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Can't fuck around.  Yeah, that's probably it.  We need friends.  I don't know.  Like, the Weez's neighbors, we're all real close with them, and I don't know.  I'm like, I don't know them. 
[02:03:30]  But as soon as they see us, oh, my God, how you been?  Oh, my God, your boy's a lot bigger.  No, it's nice.  No, I would hate that.  Why?  I don't like dealing with people I don't know.  Yeah, but you feel like you know them now.  I don't know.  And then this older couple, they had us over for dinner, and we only met them last year.  See, I wouldn't want to go over to somebody's house.  And they have a kick-ass house right on the bay.  I mean, a kick-ass house.  Is it outside dinner?  No, too many bugs up there.  When that fucking sun goes down, it gets brutal.  Outside, like a barbecue kind of thing, I'm cool with, you know. 
[02:04:00]  No, this is a house up high, looking down at the bay, all opened up with windows and such.  Gate in the dining room?  Yeah, it was nice.  I wouldn't mind that once in a while.  I hate that.  Like a nice country.  It reminds me of like, I understand that vibe, that feeling.  Good talk, good wine.  Yeah.  People are asking if you were a swinger.  It's a mole.  Well, I did say that on the way over.  I'm like, what's this about?  Is this like swingers or something?  A swinger.  That's why they like you so much, because you're like the young guy with the big cock from New York 
[02:04:30]  comes in swinging in your fucking Abercrombie sweats.  The young bull.  But I can kind of understand that.  Like, that would be nice to eat, like good home-cooked food.  No.  I wouldn't mind that.  It was nice.  I wouldn't like that at all.  I don't know.  Maybe it would get old after a while, but if you're just visiting that type of a fucking area,  it's nice.  It's just funny, his revulsion for going to someone's house for dinner.  That's a jerk.  I am a jerk.  You kind of are, man.  I am. 
[02:05:00]  I know.  The wine is really nice.  The food was really good.  I got wine.  The conversation was good.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was nice.  Wow.  What's wrong with being nice every once in a while?  Why does everything have to be so mean?  No, I like nice.  I'm very nice.  I'm very nice.  And Weez could talk his ass off.  I just don't like going over people's houses.  Oh, I do have one.  That's very funny.  Someone tweeted me and said that Sotus Point was named after a pedophile.  I got to know if that's true.  Supposedly.  Oh, up there by Hargis Bay. 
[02:05:30]  Supposedly, they named this area Sotus.  Not supposedly.  It's Sotus Bay.  After this guy.  And then after the fact, they find out he's like the worst pedophile in the area.  Wow.  Oh, Teddy Sotus.  I know him.  Oh, you knew him there, Uncle Paul?  He's a good man.  He's got a little place up there in the woods, plugging all your camera equipment.  Teddy Sotus.  Good guy.  Teddy.  It's always Ted.  Teddy.  But then I'm thinking this has got to be bullshit because why wouldn't you change the name if 
[02:06:00]  you found this out after the fact?  Look up, well, look up, look up Sotus.  Sotus Bay.  Look up Sotus slash KidToucher.  Well, Ice Teeth Bay.  Oh, in that big hallway at the MGM?  Yeah.  Because they were doing some kind of those kid-like dance moms or toddlers in Tierra things.  So there were a bunch of little kids running around with a bunch of makeup on and wearing  little horde outfits and stuff.  So this kid just comes running down the hallway and we're all walking up and Jimmy, well, Uncle 
[02:06:30]  Paul goes, oh, this is like Christmas.  It was just appalling the whole time with those kids.  And he knew all the kids on a first name basis.  Oh, yeah.  All first name basis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  It goes to the watch.  Watch your step there, Patricia.  Oh, you see him run up the hallway alone.  It's really rare you get one of them by themselves. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Separated from the herd.  Yeah.  Whenever I see that, I go, FBI, sting, sting operation.  Oh, you see it coming.  Sure do.  It's got to be a trick.  That goddamn guy and his lemon cookies.  If it's too good to be true, you know.  Whenever they say hi, do you want to come in for some?  Hey, take a, have a cookie.  I'm getting changed in there.  I run right through the screen door and go home.  I wouldn't mind a week on a lake, though.  Like, I don't know if I could do a whole week. 
[02:07:30]  I'd say two or three nights on a lake I could probably do.  What did we end up doing up there?  Three nights, I guess?  Yeah, I could do that.  Three days.  It was nice.  But, well, and we used to talk about anything.  He makes it great.  See, that I don't know.  And then we got jet skis, and then you got a sandbar.  Did you jet ski?  See, that's fun.  I didn't jet ski.  I'll tell you why.  These fucking assholes, now you've got to get a license.  And I just haven't got my license yet.  And the Coast Guard is right there.  Man, have they changed?  Wow.  Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.  I remember just buying one, like, all right, I'll take that.  And the jet ski was pretty much for the whole neighborhood, whoever wants to use it. 
[02:08:00]  Now it's like, you've got to be licensed.  You need a license to drive a jet ski.  Yeah.  I was on the back of a couple, but that's not the same fucking thing.  I guess too many people drop the fucking turning into boats.  Yeah.  And then...  I've got to tell you, when you make a right turn, first look over your right shoulder  to see if anything's coming.  It's like, do you need to be told that?  Right.  Morons.  Right.  And I made a video, and everyone was obsessing that you would be very bothered by the video  I made, Ant.  Oh, I saw that. 
[02:08:30]  Why?  They said Ant would be very bothered.  At the party where Weez is dancing?  Yeah.  I thought it was funny.  The black broads.  Look at Weez dancing with the black broads.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Why do they dance like that?  Look at those big asses.  Jesus Christ.  She's just rubbing her ass right on Weez's.  Oh, my God.  Black chicks are really bringing that obesity average up in this country.  You know how they say America's getting very obese?  Yeah.  I think they're cracking that average up a little higher than it should be, because I have... 
[02:09:00]  It's very rare to see a skinny black woman.  Holy shit.  I got to tell you.  Yeah.  And I know you're just going to hear white noise right now, but I do have to say...  At least it's white noise.  I think you need a little color at your parties, man.  They were fun.  These two were fun.  Black people have fun at parties.  These two.  These two fat broads.  I don't disagree.  They were so much...  That's Weez's daughter, by the way, in the background, seeing Weez dry up one of them.  They're fun, Ant. 
[02:09:30]  I don't think I need fat black women at my parties.  Come on, man.  Unless they're Keith Robinson and he's yelling, then he ruins us.  Keith is hilarious.  Yeah.  Keith is hilarious at parties.  You need black broads, though.  These two are wild.  I don't like black broads.  But respectable.  I'm not a big fan.  Respectable.  I don't like that dance where they fucking do the ass thing.  What is that?  It's fun.  Stop it.  There's never dancing at your parties, though.  No, there isn't.  That's true.  Never.  There would be if they were there.  You wouldn't...  I don't want that.  What do I want that for?  Some dancing and fun at a party? 
[02:10:00]  I got neighbors.  We need some broads.  We need some black broads at your next party.  No.  I agree.  Let's do it one time.  We should get some black people at a dance party.  We'll get some sisters.  I know those two now.  So, see, now I'm best friends with them.  That's how it happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I can bring them down.  Yeah.  Bring them over to your house.  How about you have them up to your building first to watch the fireworks?  I can have them up there.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  Dancing upstairs.  Why not?  And then they wouldn't leave.  You'd just be like, oh, God.  It would turn into some kind of movie.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  That's a plot of a movie.  They'd be all sassy.  Were they sassy?  Yeah, they were cool.  They drank a lot of vodka, too.  Oh, yeah.  There was one...  What is that dance?  They're fat.  Why are they doing that with their asses?  It looks like they're having fun.  In the community.  That would be fun.  In the community, that's bragging rights to have a big old ass like that.  Yeah, no shit.  And look how she moves it.  She knows how to move that.  Yeah, she does.  That's disgusting.  If she was hot, though, she could make you dump in your pants.  That's disgusting.  That wouldn't make me...  You see how that ass moved?  I don't like that.  That's very...  I know you don't like it, and your fans fucking have to speak for you. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Ed's not going to be happy with you.  Oh, I saw that.  He's not going to be happy at all.  I...  You know what the fucked up thing is?  I get exactly the opposite of that at my parties.  I get anorexic, very pale girls.  No one's dancing.  No one's dancing.  No one's having fun.  Everyone's just sitting there with liquor.  Just Morrissey playing in the background.  There's a different vibe at your parties? 
[02:11:30]  Is that what...  A different vibe.  Is that what you're trying to say?  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I don't...  I cannot relate whatsoever to black women.  Whose house was that?  I just can't do it.  That's Weez's cottage.  I don't get them.  He's got a great spot.  They don't get me?  I think you'd be wrong with that.  The houses are a little too close together, though.  I bet you wouldn't like that.  What?  His house...  The cottages are close together.  Oh, that's okay.  Waterfront.  Boat parked out front.  Just skis out front.  That's very cool.  I like places like this.  I love going to parties like that. 
[02:12:00]  I can't wait to go back.  But, you know, I wouldn't be dancing.  No, me neither.  With the fat black girls with the big asses.  You would...  These two especially...  I can only speak for them.  You'd be howling at the shit they were doing.  I'm sure I would.  You'd be howling.  They were so much fun.  I'm sure.  How does Weez know him?  I think they came with the band.  Oh, really?  I don't even know if he knew him.  Taking some liberties on the dance floor.  Yeah, I think...  Or maybe one does a little radio.  I think one does a little radio with him and the other... 
[02:12:30]  Everyone just knows everyone up there.  Oh.  And I think the other one was her friend that came with the band or something.  Yeah.  How was your band?  Really good.  Really good.  How many people at this party?  It had to be at least 100.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Yeah, it's a small space, too.  Everyone cleared away so Weez could dry hump the black broads.  And then everyone went back on after this was done.  He cleared the floor like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.  He just walks out.  Down, down, down, down.  I was impressed with Weez's hip action. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he really was getting...  Yeah.  He's getting up there a little now.  No choice.  But he...  He was sandwiched between them.  They're kind of moving him with their asses.  He's like a fucking...  The one in the yellow is using her right hip to just rub his dick.  I don't get that whole...  They look over their shoulder.  They, like, look back like they're backing a truck up.  And then they shake their ass.  They hang their arms down, like, low.  And then they kind of bend and look over.  It's almost like they're presenting. 
[02:13:30]  I think the song is called Back That Thing Up, too.  Back That Thing Up.  I never heard the song before, but it was kind of cool.  I don't like it.  So we have Back That Thing Up, E-Rock?  No?  Not all black girls are fat.  All right, Margaret.  I didn't say all.  Well, hold on.  Let's calm Margaret down.  Margaret.  Hello?  Hi, Margaret.  Where are you calling from, Margaret?  I'm calling from just outside of Philly in South Jersey.  Philly.  South Jersey.  You're not a ghetto black girl.  Not even remotely.  I think it's more of a ghetto black girl thing. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  No, you're right.  I went to school down south, and even though they weren't ghetto, they were still kind of  big.  Yeah.  And I didn't say all black girls.  Yeah.  High probability.  I didn't either, but there is a, I mean, it's statistically, they say, there's a huge  obesity problem in the black community.  It's well above the average of even the country, which is out of control.  But it's also a badge of honor, because, my God, I fucking miss them, obviously, but  Patrice used to talk about these big asses all the time, and I never understood it. 
[02:14:30]  I don't get it.  But he would go, that's delicious.  He would use the word delicious all the time.  I don't get it, and I don't think...  I don't get it myself.  And I think it's become an accepted thing to have, and I don't mean just a girl with  a nice big ass or something like that.  These are fat women.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.  Like you could just take a tray on their ass.  Even that, like, they're just fat all over.  It's not like they got a nice ass or a big ass.  These are fat women.  And it's become something that people just look at and go, oh, she's a diva.  Or they can go out and get dressed like, oh, I look good. 
[02:15:00]  Look at me.  I look good.  And it's like, no, you're fat.  But for some reason, people can't say that, or it's accepted for some reason.  I don't know.  It's obese.  I'm looking at two obese women dancing.  Oh, yeah.  They were big.  Yes.  That's disgusting.  And unfortunately, they are looked at as more favorable in their community.  That's crazy.  That's cray, yo.  But I wasn't looking at that as, oh, wow, look how hot this is.  We were all howling.  Oh, no.  They're total fun.  We were howling. 
[02:15:30]  It's like, this is making the party a little fun for a few minutes.  That's all.  Yeah, they're a lot of fun.  I mean, I'm just as much fun, and I'm 100 pounds lighter.  Do you know, I haven't really dated black girls in my life.  Like, I've gone out with some, and I've certainly had some sex.  But I've been thinking a lot about black women lately.  Like, I guess you just go through phases in life where sometimes you won't.  Yeah.  Like, I guess maybe people, I don't have a type.  So it's like I'll get, like, sometimes I like these really, I want a blonde or I want a brunette.  Like, lately I've just been thinking about black girls.  Talk to Sam.  He's been an oil derrick in the past, haven't you? 
[02:16:00]  It's called an oil derrick.  That's what I've heard.  Dated black women.  I've never heard that one before.  You've never heard that?  That's a white guy with a black chick.  Then the other way around, it's called a coal burner.  Right.  Or the white chick with the black guy.  I've heard that one before.  Are you a pretty miss?  Well, I'm a model, so I guess people would consider me a model.  You're a model?  Yeah.  So I'm 6'1".  You're 6'1"?  You're 6'1".  You're a monster.  You want to go out with a twerpy white guy way below what you're used to? 
[02:16:30]  You know what's funny?  I was at the show in Connecticut.  We just didn't have enough time to come and say hello.  What was funny about that?  Oh, man.  It's model funny.  Model funny is totally different.  People laugh because they're models.  Hey, where do we see a picture of you?  Model Mayhem, actually.  Like I said, I'm a model, so I have a portfolio there.  Wow, you're a humblebred.  Model Mayhem is a real sight.  Who are you on this thing?  Do you want to tell us on air?  Yeah.  No, I won't tell you on air.  Why?  You get a big fucking push for yourself. 
[02:17:00]  I'm a huge fan, and I'm a listener.  Wait, do you want to go?  Hold on.  Do you want us to do off air, get your name, and then we won't give your name out?  We won't say your real name.  Hold on.  We'll put you on hold so we can.  We won't Twitter your information.  Don't worry.  Talk to that idiot E-Rock.  Yeah, we're good this way.  Hold on, Margaret.  I respect your privacy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This woman is wrong.  Now we got D in Brooklyn.  You know D is going to be more like the girls in that video.  Model Mayhem is a real sight, though. 
[02:17:30]  There's a lot of really hot chicks.  Where's E-Rock?  I think he went to go pick up the phone.  Oh, he did?  Damn it.  I thought we caught him in one of his mid-show dumps when he leaves and assumes we don't  need him.  Yeah.  All right.  You got it, Sam already?  Yeah.  Is she back?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  Margaret, we're going to take a look at you now, all right?  Your name is Margaret.  Yeah, Margaret.  Yeah.  Okay.  What do they call you?  Maggie or Madge or just Margaret?  Mag.  Marge.  Where's the, uh... 
[02:18:00]  Is that you?  Oh, she's very pretty.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, you are like, uh...  Not really.  I think so.  Oh, she's very cute.  She's all right.  Turn the work safe mode off, Sam.  This is a fine...  This is a fine ebony princess.  Hold on.  Turn that off, Sam.  Turn the work...  Sam leaves work safe mode on.  Fucking clear.  Sam, what's the matter?  Are you afraid what you're going to see?  No, off.  Right there.  It's actually default.  In his defense, that's the default.  No, no.  I know it is, but it's, uh...  It's Sam's default.  He didn't turn...  Whoa!  She's fantastic. 
[02:18:30]  Now you're talking.  Wow.  Now you're talking.  I didn't know you did nude modeling.  You're lovely.  Holy smoke.  Look at that.  You just went from a five to a seven.  Now, Margaret, do you, uh...  I would...  Now, Margaret, are you married?  I'm not.  So, would you ever go to...  More nude.  Sam, what's the matter with you?  Hold on a second.  I'm working here.  Oh, sorry.  Did you ever go to dinner with a short, dumpy, white guy?  I dated a gentleman who was 5'4".  Oh, fuck.  I'm going to look great next to this guy.  I'm 5'6".  I love you.  I love you, Jimmy. 
[02:19:00]  Really, I do.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, man.  Well, what kind of food do you like?  Damn it.  I'm not really a foodie.  Clearly, I'm a model, and I really...  Yeah, look at her.  She's a little skinny.  Oh, okay.  That nude really makes girls look hot.  Oh, she's really sexy.  You think that nude really does something?  Holy...  Look at that.  That body is...  You got a nice body.  Long, beautiful legs.  She's not fat.  She's really hot.  Oh, did it make you fart, Jimmy?  Sorry, I get nervous.  Margaret made me nervous.  Oh, my God.  That's a bad one.  So, you live outside of Philly.  What kind of work do you do, Margaret? 
[02:19:30]  I'm a model.  Oh, you're just full-time modeling.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  How often are you in New York?  Any modeling now?  I was in New York last week, actually.  I go out pretty frequently.  Any modeling we would know?  Welch's Grape Soda.  Oh, Anthony.  What?  I didn't say that.  Now, Margaret, are you involved at the night?  You're single, right?  Yeah, I'm single.  So, how about, only for the radio show, how about we go to dinner?  How many kids?  And, uh...  None.  None.  Oh.  I have a master's degree, Anthony.  Oh, you're my master now? 
[02:20:00]  In what?  No, no, no, I have a master's degree.  I have two degrees, in fact.  Oh.  I think she's really hot.  So, why don't we go eat?  I promise not to make her past you.  I'll actually be a complete gentleman.  Oh, you should make her past you.  Liar.  You're going to be awesome.  Wow.  That's pretty cool, Jim.  Yeah.  I'm a huge fan.  I absolutely love you guys.  I was actually in the Camden show when Bill Burr went after the audience.  Oh, you were there?  Oh, man.  Oh, you're one of 10,000 people.  Where were you raised?  Uh, in Germany.  Really?  Because I'm not noticing a stereotypical black dialect with you. 
[02:20:30]  No, my mom was an English teacher, so I'm not allowed to speak improperly after that.  I went to, uh...  I have an undergrad degree, undergraduate degree.  Look at you.  I'm digging this.  You are the person that disproves everything I say.  I like that.  Very nice.  Okay, I'm glad that we're all getting along on that level.  The important thing is this.  Jimmy!  Jimmy's piss.  We're taking the time away.  No, no.  Not at all.  Not at all.  I think Margaret's a fan.  She knows what she's in for with this show. 
[02:21:00]  Huge.  But, um...  I don't want to pressure you into eating with me.  I just think it'd be fun.  I have a very good table.  I have a very good table.  I just watched your special on Epix.  I downloaded it.  Oh.  It was amazing.  Oh, thank you.  I just watched Connecticut on my birthday.  Oh, well.  Sounds like she's not interested.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Where?  No.  She didn't sound interested.  She was.  Oh, no.  She didn't sound interested.  How old a gal is she?  Did you ask her?  No.  Where is she?  I don't know what happened. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Pop her dick.  Come on.  Margaret?  Poor guy.  Hey, Margaret.  All right.  Margaret.  I'm still here.  Oh, you got me good.  How old are you, Margaret?  How old a gal are you?  I'm 35.  Wow, you look younger.  Wow, you don't even look 35.  That's amazing.  It's a black kid.  Yeah.  6'1".  They say black, don't cry.  6'1", 145 pounds.  She's fucking, that's nice.  Like WNBA.  That's perfect.  Yeah, you ever play sports?  WNBA girls are actually bigger.  No, I did in high school, but they're much larger ladies. 
[02:22:00]  What happened?  WNBA girls are much larger ladies.  Oh, wow.  You never played sports, though, huh?  I did in high school.  They kind of made me.  Yeah, of course they did.  Wowie.  Do you wear heels when you go out with little twerps for dinner?  Or do you wear...  No, I wear stiletto heels.  Yesterday I was in like four-inch platform heels.  Why not?  That's like 6'5".  That's crazy.  You can't go out with a 6'5 brawn.  Of course I can.  You know how great...  I promise I'll dress decent. 
[02:22:30]  I won't wear my Aussie shirt.  I was never able to go out...  Wear your Aussie Davis shirt.  I got one.  That's fucking hilarious.  I was never able to go out with a woman that was taller than me.  Really?  Yeah.  You're 5'10", though, dude.  You're 5'11".  I mean, I'm 5'6 1⁄2".  You kind of have to resign yourself to the fact that a lot of girls...  How tall are you?  I'd say 5'6", almost 5'7".  Yeah, there could be a lot of girls 5'7", 5'8 out there, right?  My ex was 5'9".  I mean...  I mean, my wife gets close when she puts heels on. 
[02:23:00]  I'm like, fuck, man.  We're about the same height.  I love a woman as taller than me.  You do like that.  Because it's just...  It was never my thing.  It was always weird to me.  It's very sexy.  It's just very feminine to have nice long legs and a long fucking sexy, juicy ass.  Like, I love a woman who's, like, tall.  Like, when you have sex, you just want to, like, reach under and grab their back and just  have those long legs around you.  And it's like, just let me come this way.  Wow, Jimmy.  I'm sure I can paint a picture.  By that, I mean hugging at the door. 
[02:23:30]  Goodbye.  Please just let me come this way before she never goes out with me again.  All right.  So let's email each other, Margaret.  I mean, unless you...  Can you give E-Rock your email off the air?  Yes.  Oh, God, E-Rock.  Okay, it was nice talking to you.  If you've ever screwed something up...  Bye, Margaret.  ...do it now.  No, E-Rock, get the email.  Just hold on, Margaret.  Get her email.  All right, Margaret.  It was a pleasure talking to you today.  All right.  Thank you, sweetheart, very much.  Hold on.  But no, I will give a full report on my dinner with Margaret.  All right.  Let me go to Dee in Brooklyn.  I'm all pissed off because I think she looks more like one of those broads in the Weez video. 
[02:24:00]  Dee?  Dee.  Hi, Dee.  You.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, she really is a tough partner.  She sounds like a lot of girls have dated.  Hi, Dee.  We weren't expecting that, Dee.  This is Dee Dee the dude, baby.  Okay, no, we figured that much out.  Yeah, Brooklyn, what's up?  So you like a girl with a big ass?  Yeah.  You know, I wanted to do some of the stuff that Margaret was saying, but it sounds like  she's just so fucking hot that I can't really say what I wanted to say about what she was saying. 
[02:24:30]  She sounds kind of like on the irresistible page, but she was saying that mostly black  women are, you know, co-signing and shit that Ant was saying, which isn't really true.  Proportionately, if you, like, play the numbers game, there's a lot of fat black women, but  it's a lot of really, really big white women.  Oh, hell yeah.  I see black guys with them all the time.  Here's the difference.  Black women who are big kind of embrace it, and it's like not, it's kind of something that 
[02:25:00]  in the black community, people don't look at it, like, oh, look at that pig.  You're right, you're right.  It's a mental health thing, though, especially to try to create some level of mental stability.  Yeah.  As a physical, there's no way that, you know, they're going to be able to, you know, feel  good about themselves if they allow people to speak to them the way that they might want  to because they're fat.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, fat white girls always walking around, you know, most of the time in loose-fitting 
[02:25:30]  clothes and kind of like, eh, I'm a lump of shit.  Yeah, and then the black chicks are all in tight shit going, look at me, motherfucker,  I'm a diva.  I know, and that shit's nasty.  I understand.  Yeah.  I understand any of that, to be honest with you, but, you know, I'm a trainer.  I'm a trainer, so fitness, that's my thing.  Oh, shit.  But I never train black women down to be really skinny.  I be like, nah, you kind of got to keep some of that.  You ain't training me, motherfucker.  I don't need no training from the likes of you, motherfucker. 
[02:26:00]  No, I hear shit like that.  I hear all kinds of shit.  But white women, they take it.  They take it all.  They take all the information.  Yeah.  You know, they do as told.  So is that what pimps are called these days now, trainers?  Is that it?  Thanks, Logan.  Wow.  All right, dude.  It seems like white women who are fat feel really ashamed of it, but black women have  found a way to make it work for them where they just kind of embrace it. 
[02:26:30]  They're like, yep, tough shit.  Yeah, kind of.  They own it.  You better like me, motherfucker.  Like me the way I am.  Go to the state fair before it leaves town.  You'll see them owning it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man, there was some fucking...  You'll see them owning it.  Yeah, there was this fat black...  A lot of fat black women in the pool at the MGM and just like wearing the most outlandish  swimsuits.  I...  Speaking of that, I was at Point Pleasant, too, over the holiday.  I'm still trying to find a beach house and I'm failing miserably. 
[02:27:00]  But...  And I couldn't videotape her properly and I'm so fucking pissed.  Black girl.  Yeah.  String bikini.  Oh, Jesus.  Nine and a half months pregnant.  There's the only way I could explain it.  Wow.  She looked like...  She looked like she either had twins or a three-year-old inside.  What a mess.  And I could not...  It's...  Whatever.  I couldn't get a video of her.  Oh, damn.  Without looking like a...  Let's see that.  ...a complete perv or getting beaten up.  You know what else?  There were these fat black women in the pool and there was a black guy and he's talking 
[02:27:30]  to like these two blonde women in the pool and the black women kind of worked their  way over there and you could just tell they were not happy with the black guy who was  in shape talking to these two white blonde women in the pool.  So he wanted something.  I had something in common with the black women too because I was none too happy either.  Jesus.  No, they weren't happy at all.  You were on vacation.  I know.  Can't you rest that part of it?  I put my racism aside. 
[02:28:00]  But it is odd though.  Like when I see...  I don't know why...  When I see...  And I've theorized about this.  Why does it bother me more if I see a really good looking black guy with a hot white chick  than I would a white guy?  And it's...  Because I see that all the time.  It's almost like what do I expect?  Like the fucking...  I've seen a black guy who's really like...  The guy's a nine.  He's in shape.  And he's with a model looking white chick.  It's like why would she want to fuck me before she'd fuck him? 
[02:28:30]  Like of course she should not want to fuck him.  A relationship with her dad?  Yeah, I'm not saying self-hatred isn't...  But it's like why would it bother me to see that when the reality is she should want to  fuck the guy who's in better shape and who's better looking.  I would.  Do you think I would fuck a four who's a white chick over an eight and a half black woman?  I just wouldn't do it.  Of course I would take the hot black chick.  What's his money like?  What's that?  What's his money like?  You know like...  That's the thing why you might have some feelings about it because you know your financial situation 
[02:29:00]  in most cases is far better.  It's like...  Fuck, really?  This dude over me?  Well I also think it's because when I look at a white guy who's in shape, I can at least  go, well, I could be in shape.  So it almost is like whatever this really good looking white guy is getting with this  girl, even though technically of course it's unattainable, I can convince myself that it's  not.  But if I see a really good looking black guy with a white girl, to me, she's lost to me  because I can never be a black guy.  Like if that's what she likes, I can never have her because I'm not that. 
[02:29:30]  Like, because I've seen really great looking, believe me, you know, white guys with chicks  that I'll never get.  So it's like, why doesn't that bother me?  I have no better shot at fucking that girl than I do at fucking the girl dating the black  dude.  Unless the black guy is some kind of a sports star or some kind of other celebrity, black  guys are usually with very piggish looking white chicks.  It's rare that you walk around and see them with really hot model-like white girls unless  they're celebrities or huge sports stars making a shitload of money. 
[02:30:00]  Every fucking white chick I see with a black guy, pig.  Laundromat, bleach blonde, fat ass pig.  But the girls I'm talking about are, the guys I meet are mostly comics and these are  good looking, like these are guys that can fucking, can, can just pick up women.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Like I.  The artist circle is different, I think.  Like if you, it's some kind of an artist circle, then you're going to get some hot white  girls.  But if it's a black guy outside of an artist circle, they're just trying to, I mean, outside  of anything creative, then it's not likely. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  It's not like you're probably going to get that white girl.  But it's silly that I look at it any differently because it's like both times the guy is usually  a lot better looking than me in a lot better shape and in, in a fair world, she should  want to fuck that guy before she fucks me.  He takes care of himself.  He's 5'11".  You know what I mean?  It's like, why wouldn't she?  How delusional am I to think that she should want to fuck me first?  It's silly.  You're funny.  Yeah, but funny, you know what?  Funny.  Funny goes a long way.  So are the guys I'm talking about. 
[02:31:00]  Into the vagina.  The guys I'm talking about are funny too.  Yeah, they're not duds either.  All right, let's say, thank you, D. I appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Hey, D.  First time calling.  I've been listening since 102.7.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, I was going to ask you about Dwight Howard, but maybe you don't care.  No, I love D. Howard.  That's not true.  I hate D. Howard.  There's rumors that he's going to be joining the Brooklyn Nets.  Yeah, he's just, I don't know, man.  We'll just do a 50-point game, man.  You can't be seven feet tall and be a dominant player and not have a 50-point game in the NBA. 
[02:31:30]  Holla.  Our question is skill level, you know, or his commitment to excellence.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, D.  Nick's fan forever.  All right, guys.  Oh, wow.  Did we match Jeremy Lin's offer?  The 28-0?  Yeah.  I feel like they're going to match it.  They can't do it until the 11th.  All right.  I didn't know because I've been out of touch a little bit.  Jeremy Lin got an offer from the Rockets. 
[02:32:00]  You know, Linsanity.  Yeah.  So the Knicks might be losing him.  I know you don't care about basketball, but you've got to care about Linsanity.  I don't think he's done much.  Holy fuck.  But now the Knicks got to pay him $28 million.  Ah.  Lucky.  Lucky boy.  So what?  It's not that bad because the deal is back-loaded for like the $14 million of the 28.  $14 million isn't coming until the third year in the fourth year of the contract, I think.  The first two years.  He was agent.  Jesus.  No, he knows this shit.  Does he know that shit?  Can I ask one more basketball question?  I know this bores you to death. 
[02:32:30]  No.  Do the Knicks ever win a championship with Carmelo Anthony?  Go.  In my heart, no.  Absolutely right.  How about with Casey Anthony?  I wish they would, but no.  No.  No.  It's Miami town.  Fuck.  Fuck!  Thank you, D.  I know it sucks.  It sucks, but it's what it is.  They signed Ray Allen.  Yeah, I know.  He's an old man, though.  Yeah, but Ray Allen.  Fucking Miami Heat turn around, they win a championship, then they sign Ray Allen in.  Do you know that?  No.  I'm lost. 
[02:33:00]  He's a three-point shooter, but they seem to have some three-point shooters over there.  Not as good as Ray Allen.  Ray Allen is the best defense shooter of all time.  He's also old as dirt.  Yeah, but what are you asking him to do?  You're not asking him to play 35 minutes a game.  You're talking about 20 minutes standing in the corner and hit open jumpers.  God damn, did he just fucking come with a comeback.  You're right, D.  Have a good day, brother.  You too, guys.  Take care.  D knows basketball.  You better fucking call us when the basketball season comes around. 
[02:33:30]  Damn.  Why don't we break Christmas-like guys on the phone?  He was the highlight of the worst of.  I want to hear from Kevin.  Where's Kevin?  He's a really skinny white girl.  He can be horrible.  In what way?  Hey, Kevin.  Let me see.  Because I agree with him if it's a certain way.  Hi, Kevin.  What were you saying?  A real skinny white girl?  I was saying to a real, real skinny white girl, if you're fucking with her, like, I'm  skinny too, our hip bones will grind together. 
[02:34:00]  And it's not pleasurable.  Ow.  If she's a little bit more plump, then you can just wail as hard as you can with no problem.  Wail as hard as you can.  I like that.  You got some of that cushion.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For the push.  No, I'm not talking like fucking emaciated white girls.  I just like white girls that aren't, like, fat white girls.  That's all.  Have you seen those white girls who think that just because they're skinny, they're hot? 
[02:34:30]  Yes, that's horse shit.  Right.  Yup.  It's guys.  They wear, like, extra skinny yoga pants.  And say, oh, check out my nice ass.  There is nothing there.  It's a flat, straight line.  There's a big difference between a flat ass and a nice, small ass.  Like, I can't stand when these fucking assholes, like, sometimes black guys or white guys that  like fat asses, they see a skinny chick that has a really nice ass and go, she ain't got  no ass.  She look like an ass like a 10-year-old boy. 
[02:35:00]  Ain't got no ass.  It's like, no, it's a nice ass.  It just ain't big and fat.  Big fat ass.  I do enjoy a very large ass, though.  Look at you.  I like a juicy one.  Skinny guy that likes big fatties.  I know.  I have low self-esteem.  I can tell you.  Yeah.  Listen to this show, you should.  Yeah.  Well, keep pounding as hard as you can, my friend.  I'll pound away.  Pounding to pound away.  All right, sir.  All right, man.  There he goes, Kevin.  Bye, Kevin. 
[02:35:30]  Jay and Brooklyn wants to talk about race.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Let's see.  Maybe it's not an argument.  We can have a question.  Jay, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, well, you know, I was listening to what Jim was saying.  Basically, what you're coming down to is just like Charles Darwin talked about, sexual competition.  All these women are always in competition.  And, you know, Anthony was saying black women don't try to, you know, really get skinny or whatever.  Well, they really don't have to because, you know, the entire culture around them basically says no matter what size that they are, they can be that way. 
[02:36:00]  But if they try to compare themselves to white women, they absolutely cannot, they just can't compete like that at all.  They can't.  So, you know, I think, you know what it is.  They're in a marriage squeeze.  And they're competing with white women.  They're competing with Asian women.  They're competing with all types of women.  And now you've got Indian women coming up, too.  Oh, boy.  The problem is, and the problem is, it's like all the eligible brothers are either in jail or they're, you know, rich and they're dating outside their race. 
[02:36:30]  You know what?  That's a very accurate depiction there, my friend.  I think you nailed it.  I don't know.  Indian women are coming on the scene now?  Let me tell you something.  I live in New York City, just like you guys work in New York City.  And these Indian women are, like, burning up the blocks.  It's like, I think part of it's Kim Kardashian or whatever. 
[02:37:00]  And now you've got all these mixed Indian girls.  It's not so much the Indian women because Indian women don't really extra marry.  You've got these Guyanese girls.  You've got Suriname's girls.  It's like.  This guy.  He knows a lot about race.  Which Indian is the best one?  To me?  Yeah.  Which one?  Not the.  Not the.  I think the mixed ones look the best because they don't look normal.  They look exotic.  Aren't they a bit hairy and maybe a little. 
[02:37:30]  You've got to breed that hair away, right?  And maybe the smell's a little different.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, well, once they're Americanized and they start using deodorant.  This guy knows.  Holy shit.  This guy knows everything.  Wait.  All right.  Hold on, Jay.  Hold on.  Fuck it.  I got.  I need to ask you a couple of questions.  I love this guy.  You know this shit.  How hairy.  Hold on.  How hairy do they get?  Oh, well, I've dated Asians.  And the thing about it is they get as hairy as they let it grow because they don't shave unless they're Americanized. 
[02:38:00]  And the whole thing about it is that the tree said, he said, if you're sweaty and mad, you're un-American.  Yeah.  Man.  You guys know me, actually.  This is Black Republican.  I didn't hear you, Jay.  You guys know me.  This is Black Republican.  Oh, Black Republican.  Oh, nice.  See, we're having a little fun today instead of yelling and screaming at each other.  No.  He's Black Republican.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he agrees with you. 
[02:38:30]  That's right.  I get our blacks confused.  Yeah, but, you know, and just like that black girl who was just on the phone, the skinny one and everything, it must be hard as hell for her, like, just to find, like, a decent guy.  It's got to be hard as hell for her to find a decent guy.  It has to be.  Yeah, why couldn't she find a decent black guy?  She looks good.  Let me tell you, you know, like, I get it off my chest.  You know, the thing about it is black women do not, they do not know how to find men.  They just don't.  No? 
[02:39:00]  What are they doing wrong?  They're going after losers.  That's the problem.  They're going after losers.  They're giving up the sex, and they're getting fucking pregnant.  They go after absolute losers.  They don't spot good marks.  It looks like they're only going after guys, you know, who are muscular only because they just got out of jail, and they've been working out for, like, the last nine months.  Jesus.  And then after they get pregnant, and then after they get pregnant, like, I have a friend, and this chick, she was getting two-timed by this guy, and he's dating somebody else. 
[02:39:30]  And now she's pregnant, like, three and a half months.  And as soon as she told me about it, I was like, you know what, go get an abortion.  But she's like, oh, no, I decided I'm going to keep it.  And I was like, wow, that's incredible, because if that was me, I'd be grabbing that coat hanger.  There's no fucking way I find out that this guy is going with somebody else, and I'm going to keep that hell down.  No, I wouldn't ruin my freedom of my future, you know, just for some quick sex.  Well, she's a statistic now. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Another statistic.  That's exactly how I look at certain people.  It's like, as soon as I hear that shit, I'm like, yeah, well, guess what, you're part of the 10%.  Yeah, wow.  All right, man.  I like when you call there.  Nice, I don't have to yell.  Yeah.  You can call Jay.  You and I almost aligned.  I hope you're ready for another four years of Obama, though.  Yeah, we'll see.  It's still too early to tell.  It's over. 
[02:40:30]  There's nothing to see.  Mitt Romney, we don't even see his ads.  It's like he's not saying anything at all.  I can't wait till the thing heats up, because he's going to get...  It's really sad, because there's no choice, and the way I see it is, it's like, you know,  I'm not totally disappointed with Obama's term, but the problem is, there's no choice at all.  The other term is Mitt Romney, and that guy, he will put us in war with Iran, just to prove  to these people that he could do it. 
[02:41:00]  Well, if Obama does get re-elected, I just hope he doesn't have any type of majority,  so that'll even things out, and he won't get anything done.  It'll be wonderful.  Yeah, good.  We'll have another four years of not getting anything done.  Of just arguing and spending money horribly.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, as long as the congressmen get paid, it's no big deal, right?  Exactly.  Those motherfuckers.  Ain't no thing.  Goddamn motherfucker.  Oh, motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Hey, good call, Jay.  Thanks, Jay.  You're welcome. 
[02:41:30]  Later, man.  I gotta go wee-wees.  Yeah, I wanted you to hit something there, E.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  This song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully, I'll remember the lyrics this time.  Have a seat and listen.  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of the heart, sometimes the truth will have a sting. 
[02:42:00]  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack.  But we will never last because I'm white and you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  If you are a newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy.  But if you're a whitey, say, 90-90, you're just not the girl for me. 
[02:42:30]  Woo-hoo.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back.  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever, because that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away. 
[02:43:00]  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker or else you best get out.  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Ooh.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class. 
[02:43:30]  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fountain of you.  Thomas Jefferson. 
[02:44:00]  Robert De Niro.  We're strong, thermal.  Strong, thermal.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You guys watch Wimbledon. 
[02:44:30]  I didn't know what was happening.  Did you see that?  Did you see that video?  Wow, that's fucked up.  Runway semi misses gas pumps.  It's taking a turn.  It flips over and just...  Wow, that was almost catastrophe.  You think that whole thing would have exploded?  Probably.  Wow, that's fucked up.  So the semi is what?  Making a sharp turn?  Yeah.  Going a little too fast and it goes sideways and slides... 
[02:45:00]  Slides into a gas station.  Just short of the pumps.  Yeah, almost hit it.  Wow, that's fucked up.  I guess that's your video of the day.  I thought it would be the...  Video of the day.  I thought it would be the tight rope walker.  That guy fell off a tight rope and then I guess didn't get hurt.  120 feet.  Something like that.  Wow.  How do you fall 120 feet?  This guy, because the tight rope walking thing is so easy for these guys that they're trying  to figure out how to make it more intense and dangerous.  Yeah.  So this guy was walking backwards with a blindfold on. 
[02:45:30]  Blindfold and I guess he slipped up.  And he fell and he's got to think, all right, there it is.  I'm dying.  And then he lands and gets up and goes, oh my God, I'm not dead.  That's a 12 story fall.  And then walks out of the woods.  Supposedly he didn't even really get hurt.  Here it is.  He slips and now he's sitting.  How many of you take off the blind? 
[02:46:00]  He stands back up.  Wow, they got...  This is way better footage than we saw this morning.  And there's a helmet cam.  Come on, the guy is way up there.  There's no way.  Oh, man.  So he's going backwards.  And he slipped and fell.  And there he is walking out of the woods.  And there he is walking out of the woods.  How did that happen?  Come on.  How did that happen?  And they don't show him falling? 
[02:46:30]  No.  That's bullshit.  Fake?  Yep.  I think there's something.  Because they show him falling and sitting down and then getting back up.  He has a helmet cam.  Why wouldn't they show the footage that captured?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Jim Norton with something we weren't even thinking earlier.  I think it's bullshit.  Watch.  But he's falling.  But he is falling.  They show him fall.  They don't show where he lands.  They don't show the cameras and follow him when he falls.  You think there could be a net there or something?  Yes.  A net.  Cigarette.  And then what?  He walks out of the woods and everyone's like, holy shit, that's a man.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Wow.  Because they show the footage how high he is. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, because we saw this before you got here this morning.  And I was thinking, why don't they have footage of him actually falling after he's out of sight?  Because they show him fall.  And then you can see he's got his own head cam on.  So there's no reason not to have more footage of that.  Aww.  You know what?  I think, because this video is relatively new, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  I think this is going to be exposed as fake and we're all going to owe Jim a fucking kiss on my dick.  Yes. 
[02:47:30]  Well, I don't know if we have to do that.  You don't have to suck it.  Just kiss the side of it.  I want you and Ante bump noses.  I was thinking more like maybe we could, you know, tap fists or something.  Fist bump or something?  Yeah.  Come on.  Jeez.  Fuck.  Uh, but he walks out of the woods unscathed.  Uh, quickly, the Wimbledon thing is just the dude who lost, I guess, Andy Murray cries like a...  Does he bitch?  Because he lost? 
[02:48:00]  Well, you know, he gave it his all and I'm sure he wanted the title.  100%.  Uh, what's his name there?  Won what?  For the what time?  Uh, seventh.  Was it really?  I think so.  Record tying seventh, uh, Wimbledon for Roger Federer.  Roger Federer.  Tying, I believe, Pete Sampson.  Oh.  I had no idea.  Sampson.  Pete, uh, Pete, uh, Pete, uh...  Pete, uh...  Sampras?  Sampras.  Okay, I got it.  Yeah, Pete Sampras.  Sampras.  It took me a couple tries, but I got that one. 
[02:48:30]  But here's, um, the dude who lost, uh, talking to the crowd.  All right.  And we almost had a Mike Schmidt moment.  Oh.  All right, I'm gonna try this and it's not gonna be easy.  Oh.  Oh.  It's not gonna be easy.  Why aren't there more people just openly laughing?  You hear the...  You hear the...  Yeah, yeah, everyone's like...  Oh.  Oh.  All right, I'm gonna try this and it's not gonna be easy. 
[02:49:00]  Good man.  Oh, you go, girl.  You go, you can do this.  Uh-oh.  All right.  It's like the beginning of a sick fucking puppy show.  No, not at all. 
[02:49:30]  Awesome.  Okay.  Uh, firstly, I'd like to congratulate Roger.  Um, he...  Right with your fucking...  This guy lost.  He almost started crying.  Yeah, but then the fucking crowd helped him out.  Crowd fucked it up.  Would you help him out?  No, they gave him time to recover.  They gave him too much time to recover, man.  We had him.  We had a Mike Schmidt moment.  He was ready to go.  You know, Mike Schmidt moment.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  What? 
[02:50:00]  With two very bad knees.  Yeah.  What happened?  His legs?  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Open your voice.  What happened?  I beg God, the dream came true.  Oh, it's just, it's so bad to be that guy.  We almost had it.  Fucking pissy eyes. 
[02:50:30]  We almost had that.  This stupid crowd had to help him out.  They gave me something to cry about.  Well, Chip was at the UFC Fan Expo with the boys out there in Vegas.  And I heard he had a good time.  He was there the entire time we were in Vegas.  The entire.  Not just the Fan Expo.  Well, that is true.  He was there for dinner and everything.  Yeah.  The long, many of the long walks to and from the hotel we talked about earlier.  The half mile walk.  Yeah.  Chip was there the entire time with us.  Oh, my.  Back and forth?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Chip.  Oh, my God.  Just bragging.  Yeah.  Cursing.  Yeah.  And looking for places to put, I guess he's thinking about opening a comedy club in Vegas  because he saw many different spots.  Every driver we had, every cab driver, car driver from the airport, they got to hear  some of Chip's jokes.  Chip was just spreading merriment.  Merriment.  Merriment.  Yeah.  It's Chip.  Do you want to know why that guy was crying?  Does anyone, anyone need to know?  Why? 
[02:51:30]  We got to get to the Chip audio because it's terrific.  Gary, Vegas, go ahead, sir.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Glad you had fun in Vegas.  That Wush was crying because he's English and he's like the first guy in, I think, 75  or 76 years to be from England and make a Wimbledon final.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was the only reason that staff was crying.  But that's it.  That's all I got for you.  Great.  All right.  Good one.  Thank you.  Good one.  Thank you.  All right.  Here's Chip talking to Sandra.  Who's Sandra? 
[02:52:00]  These are all just some MMA fans that Chip got to meet at the big UFC fan expo.  Nice.  All right.  Miss?  Do you want, we're doing interviews for Chip and TV on the YouTubes about the UFC event.  Would you talk to us on Chip and TV for the YouTubes?  Just tell us about what's going on.  What's your name?  My name is Sandra.  Hi, Sandra.  It's nice to be here in Las Vegas.  Yes, it is.  Is this your first time at the UMC? 
[02:52:30]  It's the first time for my UFC event, a fan expo event.  And I'm representing a real weight product.  And we have a booth here.  And it's in...  You have a pool here?  A pool.  Oh, it's in a pool.  I was like, what, do you think I'll swim in or something?  Yeah, we have a booth and we're representing real weight.  And what it is, it's a supplementary product.  What's it do?  It's a catalyst that breaks down sugars.  Is that a list of cats? 
[02:53:00]  Make sure you save that.  Put a highlight on that one.  Yeah, so...  So, it's a great event.  Go to the boxing fight tonight?  Unfortunately, no.  I don't know who I wanted.  Who's better?  Andre Silva or Chael Sunan?  I think Silva.  Oh, really?  So, how is your supplement doing?  Are people buying it?  Yes, they are.  What does it make you do?  Well, it breaks down the sugars and the carbs that you consume. 
[02:53:30]  So, it's a catalyst.  And it makes you do...  Does it help with weight loss and things of that nature?  Yes, it does.  I could probably use that.  Where's your booth?  Maybe I'll go over there or something.  Check it out.  Willpower in a bottle.  Is that the guy's name?  Willpower?  Get him out of the bottle.  He's going to die of AIDS or something.  I don't know.  I can't think. 
[02:54:00]  What is your YouTube?  Chip a TV on YouTube.  Thank you very much.  What happened there?  She was in shock.  There's huge gaps of silence.  It's just...  Chip kind of stands so he's shoulder to shoulder instead of right in front of her.  And just to signify he's done asking her questions.  And she just stands there.  That's one of his big interview techniques.  Is to just stop asking questions.  And it's all awkward.  And the person just stands there like...  Is he finished?  What's wrong? 
[02:54:30]  This is uncomfortable.  This is uncomfortable.  Why?  Also, now...  Chip.  Yeah.  For visualization.  Oh, by the way.  Because people are fucking really mad.  You know that last caller?  You want to guess if he was right or wrong yet?  Oh, he's so wrong.  Yeah, he's Scottish, not English.  Yeah.  I guess that's a big deal.  He's wrong.  I guess that's a big deal over there.  Caller wrong.  Caller wrong.  A lot of people say that Caller was wrong.  Again. 
[02:55:00]  The thing about Chip is that he was wearing UFC gloves.  Like fighter gloves.  Right.  While he was doing the interviews.  Nice.  And he decided to get a UFC hat.  And the one that he went for, I would have thought would be typically targeted more towards females.  Yeah, it was a chick hat.  It was an all...  I don't want no chick hats, you motherfucker.  Where's the picture?  I want to see this.  It was an all black trucker hat.  Yeah.  And then on the side, there was UFC written in pink letters. 
[02:55:30]  And on the U was a devil horns.  And on the C was an angel's halo.  I'll tell you in a second if I have a picture here.  I don't think I saw that.  No, I didn't Twitter yet because I want people to see it on the video.  Yeah, the video is where it'll be.  And that'll be up this afternoon.  We'll tweet it out and stuff.  Chip talked to Eric at the Fan Expo out there in Vegas.  Hi, what's your name?  Eric.  Where are you from, Eric?  Arizona.  Is this your first time at the UNC?  Yes, this is my first time.  It's awesome.  I'm having lots of fun. 
[02:56:00]  I've never been here and it's completely awesome.  Are you going to watch the boxing fight tonight?  Oh, yes, I am.  I can't wait to see Silva put him out even earlier today.  This time, Sonnen just talks, talks, talks a lot of crap and I'm sick of it.  Silva needs to put him out, pop, right in his jaw.  I've been saying all day, Silva is gold.  You can beat him, he's the best on the planet.  Yeah, and Chael Sonnen, they're going to change him to Chael Moonen. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, yeah, he talks too much crap, man.  He needs to stop.  You can put him out, man.  One punt.  Yeah, I took a little bit of the MNA at one time.  I was doing some karate.  Oh, yeah?  Did you like it?  It was awesome, huh?  Yeah, but I wasn't too good at it.  Neither was I.  I took karate once.  Not good at it.  I got kicked in the spine.  My mother said, Chip, don't do that no more.  You're going to hurt yourself.  I was like, Mom, who is that in the room with you?  Mom is always right.  Yeah.  Silva put him out today, knock him out.  Silva's going to take that, keep that belt today. 
[02:57:00]  Okay, thank you very much, mister.  You don't like Silva's gold?  Silva's gold.  I like that guy because he just plowed through Chip's question.  He just wanted to be interviewed so bad.  By anyone doing anything, yeah.  He just plowed right through anything Chip was saying to get those dumb stereotype fans.  Yeah, his little sound bites out there.  Right.  And the kid didn't sound too smart, but he nailed the fight.  Silva is gold.  That's a great line.  He said Silva would win early. 
[02:57:30]  He did say it.  Yep.  And well, Chip nailed it, too.  He said that they were going to start calling Chael Sonnen Chael Moonen.  Yeah, we heard that.  It doesn't make sense.  We all heard that.  Yeah, but it doesn't make sense.  What's the opposite?  We heard all that.  Moonen.  We heard all that.  I don't know if you heard.  We heard all that.  If you heard when he said Moonen.  We heard all that.  Oh.  Yeah.  We picked up on that.  Oh.  It was just a little Chip joke he was thrown out there.  Yeah.  We got it.  Some of the MMA blogs are indeed today calling him Chip Moonen.  Really?  No.  Why would they call him Chip Moonen? 
[02:58:00]  Why would they call him Chip Moonen?  Are they not?  No.  Nobody's calling him.  Why not?  Why would they pick up on that?  Well, because it is technically the opposite of Sonnen, but the word Moonen does not bring  up the image of defeat.  I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.  Chip talks to Veronica.  Veronica.  Veronica.  Oh.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Is this your first time at the convention? 
[02:58:30]  No, it's not.  It's my second time.  And where do you live?  I live in Arizona.  Who do you want to see win the boxing fight?  Well, I was going to go for Silva, but after what he pulled yesterday, I don't want to see  him.  Oh, and they was doing that chest bump.  We used to do that in high school when guys would go like, hey, Chip, you're a faggot.  And I'll go, no, I'm not.  And they would chest bump me.  But you're not.  No, I'm not like girls. 
[02:59:00]  What's your name?  It's Veronica.  Oh, you got a boyfriend?  I have a husband, yeah.  Oh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And when you just stand there?  Yeah.  He just turns away.  Stand at the mic.  I'll look at the floor sometimes.  I just want to hear one more with the catchphrase.  Have you noticed that Chip is not well prepared for his interviews?  No, not at all. 
[02:59:30]  His questioning is terrible, and he's never ready for it.  Also, a lot of people don't know this, UFC, not boxing.  Right.  He is incorrect every time.  We picked up on that, Sam.  Did you?  Yes.  Because he keeps saying boxing.  That's not the correct sport.  I can't wait to see the video.  Oh, yeah.  I just want to hear the catchphrase.  Which one is the catchphrase in?  I don't remember.  Let's keep going.  This is going very well, man.  The catchphrase is in one of them, though.  Okay.  Chip talks to Bryson, it looks like, at the UFC Fan Expo. 
[03:00:00]  Chippa TV, what's your name?  Hi, Bryson.  I'm Chippa.  Chippa, nice to meet you, man.  Thank you.  Is this your first time here at the UNC?  This is my first time in the Expo.  Who do you want to see win the big boxing fight?  The boxing fight?  The mixed martial fight.  I'm for Chael Sonnen, man.  I'm an American.  I've got to go for the American.  Yeah, my mother always said that there's too many of these goddamn uncircumcised guys  coming in here, Chippa.  They're all uncut.  What do you do? 
[03:00:30]  I'm in sales.  What do you sell?  Orthotics.  Orthotics?  Orthotics, yeah.  What orthotics?  Orthotics?  Yeah.  You go in your shoes.  Realign your body.  Do you sell feet?  I sell things for feet, yeah.  My feet are all, I'm flat-footed.  My mother would always say, Chippa, you're making a racket out there.  Quiet.  Lamar can't sleep.  Hell yeah, man.  Well, I wish you the best on your show.  Thank you, but what are you drinking?  Energy drink.  You want a drink? 
[03:01:00]  No, thank you.  I get too zooted off that stuff.  Too zooted.  Thanks.  Also, like when the people end the interviews for a shit.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, well, you have a great time.  They realize they've made an error talking to this asshole.  Yeah, how long does it go before they realize, uh-oh, oh no.  Hi, you're on Chippa TV.  Immediately regret it.  It's their own fault, because it's not like Jim approaches them as Jim and then turns into 
[03:01:30]  Chip.  He goes, hey, you got a second?  They should know what's coming.  Chip continues, talks to Vanessa and Chris at the Fan Expo.  Hi, you want to talk?  We're doing interviews for Chippa TV on YouTubes.  Sure.  Okay, cool.  You're going to be on the YouTubes on the Chippa TV channel.  What are your names?  Chris.  Vanessa.  Vanessa and Chris.  Hi, where do you guys live? 
[03:02:00]  San Jose, California.  San Jose.  Oh, okay.  Is this your first time at the UMC?  Yes.  Who do you want to see tonight?  That Chael Sonnen boy, he sure has been given a lot of lip.  Yeah, so I would like to see Anderson knock him out.  Yeah, I was like, that don't make no sense.  Oh, the catchphrase.  Did you hear that?  What are you guys doing at the X-Bahn?  So far, trying to get autographs and take pictures.  Who did you meet so far?  Nobody yet.  Nobody?  These guys aren't fighters.  I see a lot of the fighters just walking around. 
[03:02:30]  These big muscles.  That guy's probably a fighter right there in the white.  Maybe.  Maybe he is.  So what are you guys going to do later?  We're going to go to the fight and then probably hang around, see what's going on.  I like when these guys get, like, knocked out until next week, right?  Right, right.  That's what we want to see.  Yeah, I'm hoping somebody gets their fucking neck broken.  Thank you, guys.  I said we were good. 
[03:03:00]  Stupid fuck.  All weekend.  The uncomfortable laugh that guy's doing is great.  The entire time we were in Las Vegas was Chip and his catchphrase.  Catchphrase.  He created his catchphrase, I think, on the flight or right after we got off the plane,  at the beginning of the trip.  And that catchphrase just rang in our ears for the entire time.  What was the catchphrase again?  Chip?  That don't make no sense! 
[03:03:30]  We were saying it the whole time.  We just couldn't stop.  That's the same.  Like, Chip would go into Starbucks in the casino.  Yeah.  And he'd walk right up to the counter where they were selling oranges.  And go, a whole bunch of oranges in Las Vegas?  That don't make no sense!  That don't make no sense!  That was fucking terrible.  Terrible.  Everywhere we went, somebody got that don't make no sense.  Chip talks to Caitlin at the UFC Fan Expo. 
[03:04:00]  Hi, it's Chip at TV here at the X-Bahn in Vegas.  What's your name?  Caitlin.  Hi, Caitlin.  What are you doing here at the Expo?  I am just walking around and seeing all the booths and having fun.  Who did you want to see?  Who are your favorite fighters and kickboxers and karate guys and judo guys and mixed martial  artists and UFC guys and that like?  Let's see.  I want to go see Clay Guida.  I saw Josh Barnett a couple minutes ago. 
[03:04:30]  Clay Guida?  Shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to talk.  That's a blob.  You're okay, right?  I'm good.  He says shit.  So where do you live?  I live in Orange County, California.  Oh, okay.  And Clay Guida, he's got some curly hair.  He does.  I liked his hair too in the last round.  He did.  Last fight he did.  Oh, you watch a lot of the MNA fights?  Yeah.  That's pretty much my thing.  Is he your favorite one?  No, I think Cub Swanson's my favorite.  Who's Cub?  Cub Zonson?  You told me already, you fucking cocksucker. 
[03:05:00]  I can hear everything.  Shut up.  Talk about a piece of shit.  I'm sorry.  She's getting uncomfortable.  Hi, this is Chipper here at the Expo in Vegas.  So who are you here with?  Did you come with a whole big bunch of people?  Just a few people.  And who are they here to see?  Just anybody, I guess.  Should I turn my hat like that or something like that?  Yo, what's up?  We're here in the Expo, y'all.  Clay Guida.  Clay's a weird name.  What is he, live in the earth or something? 
[03:05:30]  Thank you.  When you hear me cursing, Bob is talking to me off camera.  So I'm just cursing at him.  I told Bob to tell Chip to correct Chip on his microphone technique.  Yeah.  And so Bob would go, Chip, you got to put the mic to her mouth.  And he would just...  Shut the fuck up, cocksucker.  I was holding, I was holding, I had the UFC gloves on and holding the mic like directly  uncomfortably in front of their face.  Yeah, he had the microphone like, like right up by his hand, which is covered in the glove. 
[03:06:00]  So when he give the mic to somebody or put the mic to somebody's mouth, it's his fist.  His gloved fist is right in their mouth.  It's so uncomfortable.  And then the whole time, he's just sitting there.  I don't even know what he was doing.  He's cursing at Bob.  He's resetting up the interview.  He's changing his hat.  And the girl is right next to him thinking that she's going to be interviewed.  Right.  We have one more from the Fan Expo.  And then the video later today.  Oh, yeah.  Good, good, good. 
[03:06:30]  Here's Daniel or Danielle or...  I don't know.  Daniel, I think.  Daniel?  Yeah, Daniel, definitely.  Oh, come here.  Hi, how are you?  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  Pleasure.  Hi, I'm Chipper.  We're on Chipper TV on the YouTubes.  What's your name?  Daniel.  Hi, Daniel.  Are you a fighter?  I used to fight, but I just train.  Did you ever get...  I just train.  Now, what happened?  Did you ever get...  I fought when I was very young in, like, fourth grade, but I never pursued it. 
[03:07:00]  Now, you got to start that young if you want to be a fighter.  You have to fight all the time.  That's got to be your life.  It has to be your life.  You can't just come in and just, you know, want to do it for fun.  No, it's...  I got beat up one time.  I went to the bathroom on myself.  That's happened to me.  Actually, that happened last night.  Very scary.  So, where do you live?  Shut the fuck up.  Call the fuck up.  Keeps interfering with my interviews.  Where are you from?  I'm from Cali, Santa Barbara, California.  Oh, okay.  And who do you want to see winning the Kyle Sonnen fight? 
[03:07:30]  Uh, I want to see Cheo win, you know, just because Anderson's...  I don't know.  Anybody that's been holding the reign that long, they want to see someone else win, but  Anderson's too skilled.  I don't know.  I don't...  You know, whatever.  What about the Forrest Griffin?  What's he called Forrest for?  What's he called for?  Tito.  A bunch of trees around or something?  Tito.  Tito.  Ortiz.  Oh, the guy he's fighting?  Yeah.  Hey, what's that?  A train wreck or something up there?  Oh, look.  That's the training center.  Okay, well, are you going to... 
[03:08:00]  Do you have good seats for tonight?  I do.  I'm flying to Brazil in about 20 minutes.  Why are you going to Brazil?  Watch the fight.  You're not going to make it.  I'm taking my jet over there.  Sorry.  Thanks.  Thanks.  It's so uncomfortable how these end.  I was doing some more catchphrase in there, because that's going to be a hit.  I love the catchphrase.  What's the catchphrase?  That don't make no sense!  Sometimes don't make no sense.  Sometimes he uses it in proper context, and sometimes not. 
[03:08:30]  Sometimes his catchphrase, that don't make no sense.  Yeah.  Doesn't make any sense.  Doesn't make sense.  That's fucking just...  Yeah, they stunk.  Uncomfortable.  In a good way, though.  Yeah.  I like that.  Just hard to listen to.  Chippa.  You don't like listening to Chippa?  I like watching it better.  No, it worked.  I want to see the other video.  So uncomfortable.  I like it. 
[03:09:00]  And I mean, some of the pauses, too, I kind of...  Is it so uncomfortable that we should leave?  No.  Fuck!  You just took all this time off.  You were at a lake, relaxing.  Yeah, I'm relaxed.  You still want to leave early?  Yeah, ease into this.  What is it about this...  I don't know what we're just easing into this shit.  What is it about this show that you want to leave early every day?  We should ease back into it.  This is not a difficult...  Oh, nice.  Like...  It's a good job to have.  Oh, I love the job.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Very easy.  But we're like any other person that works for a living, Sam.  Yeah, but they do eight hours.  They find ways out.  Yeah, but if they did four, they would try to do 345.  You know what?  Those people that work for a living...  That's the reality of this whole thing.  If they listen to this show to escape, and the last thing they want is you guys ending  early and not giving...  Well, if they're listening to escape, why can't we escape?  There you go.  I just got a little wordy.  Governor Christie gets loud with an ice cream cone in his hand.  This made me howl.  I thought they had no sense.  Oh, shit. 
[03:10:00]  Governor Christie was doing his...  I don't know what he does.  He was out and about, and he had an ice cream cone.  Yeah.  And some guy said something, and he's trying to get aggressive.  He's a no-nonsense, doesn't-take-any-guff kind of guy.  Is there a video of this?  I believe so.  He's a cranky fatso.  He is.  He really is a cranky fatso.  He really is.  Hold on, hold on.  Before you play it, what's the backstory on this?  Well, you just have to make sure this is the video before...  Better be.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why can't people figure out the fucking landscape on the camera? 
[03:10:30]  I don't know.  Come on.  Because somebody, during a visit to Seaside Heights on Thursday night, Chris Christie engaged  in a shouting match with a passerby who criticized the politician for his policy on education.  But why wouldn't they just make everything landscape, is what I don't get.  Like, if you're holding your phone like this...  They should figure it out, yeah.  Why wouldn't they just go, look, you know, landscape, always?  I don't know.  Because in this day and age, it doesn't matter.  I guess so you have the option. 
[03:11:00]  But then everyone turns their phone this way for landscape, which is not natural, because  you have your phone like this all the time.  I know.  So make this landscape as well.  I just automatically know to just...  I don't.  Well, but you're right.  A lot of people still don't do it.  Oh, God.  Yeah, WorldStar Hip Hop.  Anyone that sends a video in from them, they never fucking do it right.  You miss half the action.  Yeah.  Don't make that sense.  Half the stomp downs, the beat downs.  Yeah, so Christy's getting all tough as he takes his... 
[03:11:30]  He has an ice cream cone, and then he kind of starts waddling toward the guy.  Ugh.  Be a tough guy?  You can't be a waddling tough guy.  No.  All right, let's see this dumb video.  TMZ.  You're a real big shot.  You're a real big shot.  You're a real big shot.  Take your mouth off.  You're a real big shot.  Take your mouth off.  Keep walking away.  Keep walking.  Keep walking.  Keep walking.  You know what? 
[03:12:00]  He's a fat douche.  He's a fat douche.  It's like, you know what?  What a fucking baby that guy is.  You don't like that?  No.  I understand not wanting to be yelled at.  Just a big fucking fat soul waddling down the thing.  Eating an ice cream.  Go fuck yourself.  Was it that crazy what the guy said?  I don't know.  But if the guy yelled at a politician, tough shit. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, every politician should be yelled at.  Oh, they should be fucking just harassed on the street.  Every single one should be yelled at.  That's what their lives should be like.  Verbally bashed on the street.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Not just Republicans.  Democrats, too.  All of them.  All of them.  Every fucking one of them.  A bunch of useless fuckers.  I can't stomach him.  You don't like him?  No, I really don't.  Because I hate his gay marriage.  He just annoys me.  Fuck him.  Was he gay?  What happened?  I don't know.  What was the other one?  He'd probably be a big bear if he was.  The gay governor of Jersey thing doesn't really work out that well. 
[03:13:00]  So maybe that's what it is.  Maybe it's just thinking, meh.  I'm a gay American.  Did you see Barney Frank got married?  Oh, did he?  Did he marry a woman?  No.  A man?  Yeah.  That don't make no sense.  Oh, shit.  You set me up.  You know, it's Adam and Eve, not...  All right.  Barney Frank.  Oh, Barney Frank.  Oh.  Oh, ass sexist for the young. 
[03:13:30]  What is he thinking?  Look at him.  Married a nice fella.  They're both in suits.  Does there have to be a top in these?  Yes.  Always.  Then who is then?  Barney's the bottom.  Probably, yeah.  Barney's absolutely a bottom.  Look at that guy.  He looks like a top.  And Barney's very powerful in his real life.  So a lot of people who are powerful in their real life want to be submissive, sexual.  Oh.  Look at him.  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  I bet he likes to be kissed as his hiney is being filled.  Oh. 
[03:14:00]  Like, I bet you Barney likes his legs pinned back, and he likes to be deep-fucked missionary.  Like, the guy will lock his hands under Barney's hiney.  Yeah.  And simultaneously spread the cheeks and deep-fuck him while they kiss.  And Barney is like, Barney gives out a little moan.  I'll bet you the stomach friction makes Barney cum on his own belly.  Like, the two guys, like, Barney's boner is sticking up, and the other guy's stomach  rubbing on Barney's boner makes him cum on himself. 
[03:14:30]  Well, Barney Frank got married over the...  Good for Barney.  The long holiday weekend thing.  Hey, the gays can get married.  Why not?  What state did they get married in?  Massachusetts, right?  I guess.  I guess.  What states are still saying, go fuck your mother?  Most of them.  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  Sure.  Jersey.  California.  California.  Which is crazy, because a lot of gays are in California, right?  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  They're not organized, obviously.  Most of the country is still...  There's very few are pro-gays.  Most are Texas, and they're all totally no.  What's the key say?  New York, Iowa, and Mass, Connecticut, Vermont.  Wait, only the blue ones?  Yep.  No kidding.  That's it.  That's it.  I thought there were more.  And how come there's so many colors?  What's, like, the worst one?  What is that?  They cut your fucking balls off and shoving it in your throat?  Yeah.  Just look.  State Constitution bans.  Whatever color Texas is. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the bad one.  Texas is the bad one.  That's blood red.  They're like, fuck that.  That's basically what they're saying.  Bans.  Same-sex marriage and some or all other kinds of same-sex unions.  Oh, so they don't even feel...  All of Florida, Texas.  Yeah, the deep red.  Yeah, just the shitty Louisiana.  Look how it goes up into Michigan.  Yeah, what's that middle thing all about?  Fucking Ohio.  What's that middle line of states all about?  Why are they all band together? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, that is...  Well, what is that about?  I don't know.  Is that basically saying we're all Texas?  Texas, Oklahoma.  Standing on Texas' shoulders.  What's the pink?  Yeah.  State statute bans same-sex marriage.  Two in the pink.  So what's the second best?  State Constitution bans same-sex marriage.  Oh.  How blue do you think that map's going to get in the next year or two?  It depends.  Hopefully more.  I mean, that is one thing I like about Obama. 
[03:16:30]  I mean, there's a lot I don't like about him.  But one thing I like about him is this.  And anyone who...  I'm not going to go on a thing about it.  But people's arguments against it,  you're simply infringing on other people's right  to live as they want to live.  You're a fucking twat.  It's state laws, though.  Obama really doesn't have anything...  No, but it's like, again, shit rolls downhill  when the guy in charge kind of dictates the tone a little bit more.  And I like the fact that he's for it.  I just like the fact that he's for it. 
[03:17:00]  You've got to think Pennsylvania will go.  Eventually.  But there's a lot of rural Pennsylvania.  It's not all Philly.  In Pittsburgh, I don't think it's too liberal a state.  Yeah, a lot of times you forget  and you look at a state based on one of the big cities.  Big cities, right.  Right.  You realize, nope, it ain't like that in the whole state.  Yep.  They will look back on this the same way  we look back on the way race was handled here  and go, what the fuck was that about?  What did we make a mistake?  But, you know, all right. 
[03:17:30]  These will be seen as very primitive thinking.  The fact that people have to fight for their...  For their right to ask sex.  Yeah, I mean, look, if that's what they want to do...  I can't see getting married to a woman,  much less a fucking man.  But, I mean, if you want to do it,  who the fuck...  Why do we just feel comfortable  living other people's lives for them?  It's annoying.  It's not that sacred.  It drives me nuts.  It's not that sacred, either.  No!  Who gives a fuck?  With everyone getting divorced,  how sacred is the whole guy?  Women are raping guys in divorce cases?  Right.  Really?  Is that your big fucking sacred thing? 
[03:18:00]  Half of them end.  People see it as something  they don't want to have to address  to their children  and things like that.  Yeah, fuck them and fuck their kids.  So they have to be like, you know,  oh boy, how am I going to explain  why two men get married  when you could say, you know,  two people, a man and a woman get married  so they could have a family  and children and stuff.  And then you say,  well, why do two guys want to get married?  And you've got to tell your kid,  well, they like the feeling  of a dick going in the ass.  Yeah, same as your mother does.  That's why we're getting divorced  because it wasn't mine. 
[03:18:30]  If you have to explain  why you and your fucking wife  are getting divorced  and you and your,  I don't, I hate when people  use explanation to their kid,  then don't fucking pump a load into her  if you can't handle explaining shit.  Tony has a problem with you  and Hoboken.  Okay.  Hoboken.  Hoboken, Tony.  Oh, he's gone.  What did he have a problem with?  You want to know why he's a,  what did you say?  A twat?  Yeah.  He goes, why am I a twat  because I don't agree with you?  No, you're not a twat  if you don't agree with me.  But Tony, you've got to call back  because we're going to you.  You're not a twat  if you're against gay marriage. 
[03:19:00]  You're not a twat  if you hate gay people.  That's your business.  You're a twat  if you're infringing  on somebody else's right  to live the way you live.  I don't care how you feel.  You don't have to like people.  I'm not thought policing you.  It's the action  I have a problem with.  You can hate gay people  if you want.  Again, that's your prerogative.  But when you start to say,  this group can't do  what I can do,  you're a cunt.  Yeah, I'm one for  a lot of personal freedoms.  I'm not going to be one of these.  I don't like that  because of my political 
[03:19:30]  or religious ideology.  Go blow me.  Just fucking do whatever you want.  Get married.  Who cares?  It doesn't bother me.  Right.  More importantly,  did you see Kayak Guy?  Oh, with the shark behind him.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's Cape Cod, right?  Yeah.  I used to go to Cape Cod a lot  when we lived up there.  There is too many  fucking sharks up there.  How far is he from the land?  Way more than Long Island.  Amity means friendship.  Not far.  That guy's standing  in the photo, Jimmy.  So what?  Is he standing?  Yeah, he's less than 
[03:20:00]  100 feet offshore.  We can't see  because fucking Fox News  is covering the bottom  of the photo.  That guy's definitely standing.  Or he might be  on one of those...  We can't see what he's in  because Fox News  is blocking the photo  with that bullshit.  Yeah, he might be  in one of those, what,  standing up fucking paddle...  Oh, here.  From about 10,000 animals  to almost 300,000 animals  over the last 40 years  since we protected the seals.  At the same time,  we've been decimating  the shark populations  at a rate of about  73 million per year.  So now that the Great Whites  are protected  and the seals are protected, 
[03:20:30]  we do kind of know  that this is going to happen  as sharks keep coming back  to the same area  because there's lots  of seals there.  Yeah, you make that  great point  because the seals  have now been protected.  Oh, shut up.  I love sea lions.  So basically,  the guy, I think,  just before he went  in the water  was joking, I think,  with his daughter,  if I read this correctly,  about sharks.  And next thing you know,  he's out there in a kayak  and it's a scene  right out of Jaws.  Like, all of a sudden,  they see the fin  and everyone just starts  going, you know,  paddle faster, paddle faster,  and he fucking hauled ass  back to the shore. 
[03:21:00]  Are you kids okay over there?  Yeah.  You kids okay over there?  Dummy in his foot  with the nicely tied sneaker  goes right to the bottom.  Nice double knot.  I was out in,  I think it was,  it was either  Martha's Vineyard  or Nantucket.  I get those two islands.  There was a man  from there once.  Yes, there is.  That's right.  Something we could do  with something  because it was long.  That's right.  And man,  everyone had to get  out of the water  because a fucking shark  came really close to shore.  She had a lot of them  out in that area.  A shark coming to shore,  that don't make no sense. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, shit.  I'm close to shore, yeah.  Shit.  You ever see a shark  out on Long Island  on those beaches?  I don't think I've ever  seen one.  Never on Long Island.  Maybe Montauk.  No, I've never seen one,  but up there,  I definitely saw a few.  You got to kind of  get into the deeper water  around Long Island,  especially off Montauk.  So what's the difference  with King Cod?  Fucking sharks there.  Well, I think it's,  I don't know.  What is it?  King Cod  and Martha's Vineyard  and Nantucket,  they definitely see sharks a lot. 
[03:22:00]  I just heard Sal,  our guy,  was sharking this weekend.  Sharking.  That's a term they use  in bathhouses  when you only take your cock  out of the front of your pants  and you run around  and when you see another guy  with only the head of his cock  out of the front of his pants,  you go,  dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  And you rub your cock heads together  to one of your cums.  That's sharking?  That's sharking.  Let's go sharking.  Well, now you know.  It's where only your cock head  is showing through your pants.  Have I summed up sharking properly  or am I off?  Yeah, that's exactly what it was. 
[03:22:30]  Sharking.  Yeah, no, I was sharking.  I was actually fishing offshore.  Let me see your hands.  They're soft from counting money  your whole life.  You got city hands, Sal.  I'm not talking about  hooking bluegills or tommy cuts.  I'm talking about sharking.  Yeah, you got soft hands  from handling E-Rock's lunch  all your life.  Tie me a sheep shank.  Yeah, and a thresher came in.  I caught a small fish.  Thresher, did it cut your leg  and leave a scar?  No, and...  Did it cut your arm?  It did?  Yeah, it did. 
[03:23:00]  A drink to your leg.  And we tried to catch it.  We couldn't get it, though.  What?  That's a big sharking story?  That's a big sharking story.  Terrible.  Where you go sharking?  No, it's just like the orca.  You can go sharking.  We went like...  Why?  Because it's fun to fucking kill a shark.  Why?  Why?  They're just doing what they do.  Well, yeah, but it's still like...  It's a fucking trophy piece  when you get like a big-ass thresher.  Why?  It's just fucking...  Fucking leave it alone.  It's not bothering you.  It's fun, though.  It's not fun.  It's not fishing you.  You want to be brave?  Go up and fucking...  Go up with no weapons at your fists  and hunt guys on 145th Street. 
[03:23:30]  Go...  You want to get a tooth?  Leave the shark alone.  Go take it out of a guy's mouth  and get a fist.  When a shark comes to the side of the boat,  you're fucking shitting yourself.  How big was the thresher?  And your thought is,  let's get hatchets and hackets.  How about you look at it  and go,  wow, that's beautiful.  Yeah, yeah.  You're in a boat.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Don't matter.  How about you swimming?  What's Jimmy's...  Or you go tubing and then do it.  What's Jimmy's bit?  It's one of my favorite ones of all time  where he describes fishing  and he says,  just imagine all of a sudden  the hook comes down from the ceiling 
[03:24:00]  and yanks us out of these roofs.  With a steak on it or something.  I forgot exactly,  but I've never laughed hard,  I don't think.  Your whole take on fishing.  I hate it.  You just get pulled into the ocean.  Right.  Hey, what the fuck?  Imagine sitting here  just minding your own business  and a hook comes from nowhere  and just hooks you  and takes you away.  Totally uncalled.  Kenny brings our breakfast.  We just start eating it  and just get hooked.  That's right.  Fucking pulled into the water somewhere  to drown.  That'd suck.  Cage goes in the water.  Faggot goes in the cage.  Faggot you. 
[03:24:30]  You fruit.  Catch and release  or you have to keep the ditch  and full release?  You're allowed one over 56 inches.  What?  They have a regular...  It's highly regulated.  If you get one  that's over the 50...  Wait.  Which one is the one  you can keep?  You can keep pretty much  anyone except...  Do you keep them?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  My guinea-ass family  will cook that up  like that evening.  Oh, yeah?  Do you eat the shark?  Oh, I have eaten shark before.  Shark fucking parmesan.  Oh, like my mother used to make.  When you come back  with the shark,  she fucking fillet it 
[03:25:00]  nice and thin  and put the cheese  out of the fucking mother.  You put a little olive oil  on the back of the shark  and she's spinning around  with her dumb fingers.  Her dumb do-nothing fingers.  Her look the other way  while her husband  robs everybody's fingers.  Her try to block  the punch fingers.  Exactly.  Shark isn't tasty  and I hear  that a lot of shark  is dangerous to eat.  A lot of them  because they don't have bladders.  They secrete...  They, like,  through their, like,  cells, 
[03:25:30]  they, like,  piss out their body.  Yeah.  So you have to be careful  which one you eat.  So sharks can be very toxic.  Oh, yeah.  Very, very.  Oh, you don't drink shark tinkle?  That's the only thing I like, yeah.  Oh, the shark piss  and make you very virile.  Yeah, everything gives you...  And a man will give you a boner.  All right,  you fucking freak.  Sharks piss to their skin?  Yeah, yeah.  That don't make no sense!  Oh, shit.  Nailed it!  The reason sharks are up there  and not down here?  Cold water.  Is that true, Sal?  Yeah, they swim  in, like, these thermals.  They like cold water, right? 
[03:26:00]  They, they like swimming  in, like, long johns?  Where it's, like, uh,  it's, it's like a thermal  where the hot water  goes to the cold water.  It's not very interesting at all.  But, um...  Dude, they like cold water.  Uh, not really.  Over warmer water.  They, they'll come right here.  They come right up  to fucking Hudson.  They barely come up  the Hudson River.  You get one every once in a while.  I saw, I saw dolphins.  We went offshore.  You didn't see dolphins.  We saw, I can get the video  for you right now.  I saw dolphins.  What, like a Barbie doll  with a fin on it or something?  That don't make no sense!  You're crazy, motherfucker! 
[03:26:30]  Cocksucker!  All right, Jimmy, you gotta plug.  I don't, I don't want to see  this dumb dolphin video.  No, not really.  August 11th,  8 o'clock outside of Chicago  with Artie, Nick, and David Tell.  That's it, man.  Horseshoe Casino.  That's it.  I had no plugs.  Oh.  Thanks, Sal.  That was terrific.  Oh, thank you.  Really earned your keep today.  Not good, huh?  It's amazing.  Did you find out  if sharks like cold or warm water  during the after show?  I would ask Sal, 
[03:27:00]  but he has no fucking idea.  And does, does, uh,  Iraq have the fishing bit  from Jim Norton?  He doesn't listen to what he plays.  He doesn't know for sure.  Yeah, he'll put me somewhere.  We have a portion of it  we can play during the after show.  Why a portion?  Because it was a long bit.  Ooh.  Oh, meaning you gotta edit it.  Yeah, I have a,  no, I have a five minute version  of it we can play.  So why don't we play that now?  Okay, hang on.  Because Sam doesn't have  to discuss that.  It's just,  it's just an add-on  to what we were talking about  and then Sam will start his,  uh, after show all nice.  Yeah.  Plus I probably would forget 
[03:27:30]  because I'm sure  I'd butcher Jim's bit  so I want to, like,  give it, you know.  I eat it off.  Dude, it's hilarious.  Your fishing bit is hilarious.  That don't make no sense.  Oh.  God, dude.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye, bye, bye.  The fish comes up,  then he would put out the fly,  jump on the fly.  So it's kind of similar  in the concept.  That sounds like  the worst activity in history.  Wait a second.  You never caught  a 600-pound blue marlin? 
[03:28:00]  I haven't, no.  Have you, Jimmy?  No, why would I?  For what?  For what?  Someone else will catch it for me.  And they'll film,  they'll cook it for me.  It's a sport, Jimmy,  for some people.  It's not a sport.  It's a sport.  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fists  and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook  and the fish has nothing but hunger.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  It's not a sport.  A bunch of fucking fat fucks  drinking Pat's Blue Ribbon  trying to hook some asshole fish. 
[03:28:30]  And I don't drink.  Whatever, the fish is,  how is it a sport  if the fish could never know  that was coming?  The fish is just kind of  swimming around  and all of a sudden  there's metal in his mouth.  It's not a sport.  If you hop in the water  and dress like bait  and then the fish shows up  and you hook him  with a hook on your fist,  that's a sport.  Punch him in the mouth.  But you're in a boat.  Is it skill to get the fish up  that you have to add?  It's not a skill  you're tricking  a prehistoric animal.  It's a real skill  to get the shrub  to stand still  while you trim it. 
[03:29:00]  Yes, shrub trimming.  That's a real sport.  You have to sneak up  or the bush will run and hide.  No, it won't.  It's a bush.  Jimmy.  It's not a sport.  Jimmy, it's a sport.  It's a fucking holocaust.  It's not a sport.  Holocaust?  Yes, I'm saying this.  The fish have no chance of winning.  Are you bothered  by fishermen and hunters, Jimmy?  Not hunters.  It's a holocaust.  Hold on, sorry.  I said it's a holocaust,  not the holocaust.  You're a reactionary  dopey fisherman.  Shut up.  A holocaust.  What I'm saying is this. 
[03:29:30]  Here's what I'm saying.  I'm also dopey.  I'm sorry.  You have the timing  of a stroke.  You just keep babbling.  We're talking here.  Hunting, I don't mind  a guy who's fishing  and hunting  and then eating  what he catches  or whatever.  I got no problem with that.  My point is  don't look at it  like it's a sport.  You're not a sportsman.  Well, I didn't name it sportsman.  I'm just letting you know.  You're not a sportsman.  What's a sportsman to you?  A guy who competes  with others.  I'm telling you.  A sportsman is a guy 
[03:30:00]  who competes in a way  with other athletes  doing the same thing.  That's a sportsman.  Yeah, that's why  there's 50 or 60 boats  fishing at the same area.  No, no, you're competing  with other men  to hook a fish.  The direct competition  is the animal, sir.  The direct competition  is the fish.  It's the dopey,  prehistoric,  fucking one-cell brained  idiot that you tried  to hook.  That'd be like  if you just ran out  and tried to punch  retarded people.  That's a sport.  I try to lure them  with cotton candy  on my fist.  Jimmy, did you ever go 
[03:30:30]  to sea fish?  You know what?  That's pretty accurate.  That is pretty damn accurate.  No, I never have, sir,  because I get seasick.  I have about  a million times.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  I'm an expert.  You're not.  Good, you're an expert,  so you know  that what you're doing  is not a sport.  Just admit that.  It's fun.  You like to do it.  Why doesn't you ask Opie?  Why doesn't you ask Opie?  I don't know.  I'll tell you  what else you haven't done.  Apparently you didn't  read a lot  while you were on the boat,  do you?  You just fucking  throw that thing in there.  Richard, you might want  to leave me out of this  because I probably 
[03:31:00]  would have agreed with you  until Jimmy's rant.  It's not a sport, sir.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  He met me in the shop.  Jimmy has a hard time  distinguishing some sports  from others  or thinking some things  are sports,  and he doesn't happen  to think it's a sport.  I'm not saying  you're not an athlete,  but I'm saying  when you're fishing...  What was that line again?  The fish is hungry  and you're what?  You have a hook  and the fish has hunger.  How is that a sport?  Yeah, yeah.  You're teasing the fish  to come up to see  what's on top. 
[03:31:30]  Exactly.  Because we make  the whole teasers  look like bait fish.  Well, let me ask you  a question.  Why don't you...  Is NASCAR a sport  somebody's right?  Yes, of course it is.  Why don't you go in there?  Why don't you do this  if you want it to be a sport?  Why don't you dress  like something  that the fish would eat  and then when the fish  comes up,  you knock its fucking block off?  Well, I don't believe  in NASCAR  because I hate left turns.  But you understand  what I'm saying though?  Why don't you...  Because they make  a lot of left turns.  Yeah.  So why don't you do...  That's a sport.  Like why don't you go  shark fishing?  Why don't you jump in there 
[03:32:00]  and trick the shark  and attack...  Even if you have a weapon  in your hand,  hand-to-hand combat  with the shark.  Why don't you do...  That's a sport.  I'd like to see you do that.  You know what, Jimmy?  I don't need to do it.  I'm not saying it's a sport.  I'm saying what it is.  When you're doing  some kind of sport,  there's got to be  a winner and a loser.  So how does the fisherman lose?  I mean...  How do you lose?  We don't get the fish  to the boat.  Yeah, but when a fish loses,  it pretty much loses its life.  Yeah, what are you risking?  Unless you're, you know...  We don't kill them.  Catch and throw.  What are you risking?  Catch and release,  whatever, yeah.  Huh? 
[03:32:30]  It's the adrenaline rush.  Catching a blue marlin  standing up  and fighting it  for an hour,  maybe two hours,  maybe three hours.  Okay, so you're risking  basically an adrenaline rush  while the marlin  is having the inside  of his face  ripped apart  with a hook  for hours on end.  Really?  You give him a little trophy  in the winner's cup  when he wins?  Oh, would.  What do you give the fish  when he wins?  Just a scraped up mouth  and he sent him home?  Now he's afraid  to eat anything?  You know how many fish  probably become anorexics?  Holy shit,  does this guy  just fucking babble. 
[03:33:00]  He just babbles.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show  is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like  sticking around  after One Day Live  is next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Sirius X out.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now,  the Opie and Anthony show  continues.  This is  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, yeah!  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Back live  after a bit of a hiatus.  I heard a lot of good things  about  Worst of the Year so far.  A lot of people  seem to enjoy it.  Was me and Chip  arguing  part of Worst of 2012  so far?  Yes,  we did a whole montage  of Chip from the year  because, you know,  Chip only shows up  in short little bursts.  Which I've always thought 
[03:34:00]  don't make no sense.  Well,  it would start off  with you two fighting  and then it would be  about him  staring at Troy's cock  and then go back  to you two fighting.  Yeah,  I got a lot,  I got a bunch of tweets  at one point  about people  who were so happy  to hear me and Chip  fighting so I assumed  it must have been played.  It's very funny.  I didn't get to hear  any of it  because we were  in Vegas  just working  like ridiculous  from July 5th  till...  Did you partake  in buffets?  In buffets?  Yeah,  Vegas.  Is Vegas known 
[03:34:30]  for buffets?  Oh,  yeah.  No,  we didn't partake.  We went to a couple  nice steakhouses,  we went to some nice dinners  but no buffets.  There's some great buffets  in Vegas.  Yeah,  that's what they're known  for,  dude.  Vegas is not known  for buffets.  Yeah,  they are.  Money buffets.  Vegas is known  for gambling  and shows  and prostitutes.  No,  because shows,  gambling,  buffets,  shows,  hookers.  You think Vegas  is more well known  for buffets  than it is for shows?  No. 
[03:35:00]  It's not right up there.  Eric?  No,  I don't think it's  well known for shows  but it is  I'm sorry,  you guys are in college.  Wait,  didn't Roland spend time?  Yeah,  four years.  Yeah,  but that means  that that's what  Roland did there,  not what Vegas  is known for.  What Vegas is known  for is an easier  question for somebody  who didn't go  to school there  because they would  know what it's just  no,  how do they,  what do you know?  How many times  have you been to Vegas?  I've never been to Vegas.  What do you think?  It just seems like  it's a town of shenanigans  and,  you know.  Now it's shenanigans,  you mean restaurants  with buffets?  Yeah,  the fans get up like crazy. 
[03:35:30]  He knows.  Yeah,  no,  it's not,  I mean,  I believe you that  there are good buffets  there,  but I don't think  Vegas is more famous  for buffets  than shows.  No,  it's known for buffets.  More than shows?  No,  it's up there with,  Siegfried and Roy  and Denny's.  No,  but like,  what's the big one?  Treasure Island,  don't they have?  The World Buffet,  Rio.  Some of the best buffets  I've ever gone to  are in Las Vegas.  I'm not saying  it doesn't have  good buffets.  It's fucking amazing. 
[03:36:00]  I'm saying that  it's not more well-known  for buffets  than shows  and prostitutes.  Every fat ass  that goes there,  when they land,  they go,  where's the buffet?  And you know what?  There's a lot of fat asses  that go to Vegas.  That's what it's built on.  Maybe Sal and me  are in the wrong...  Well,  yeah,  I mean,  you're like,  where's my chicken fingers?  Over there.  Let me talk to Kevin  in Houston.  Kevin,  you think it is  known for buffets?  It absolutely is known.  More so than shows?  Yeah.  Probably about equal.  It's changed a little bit  over the years.  It's not as big  as it used to be, 
[03:36:30]  but it absolutely...  I mean,  you go to the Bellagio Buffet,  you can choose from,  I think,  something like  1,200 different menu items.  Yeah,  and they have caviar  and everything.  In the buffet?  Yeah.  What if somebody sneezes in it?  They have guards up.  Oh,  thank God.  Well,  but it's like  you get a steak  and lobster fight  $8.99 on Wednesdays.  It's probably really good,  too.  It's fucking amazing.  Is it?  Is it delicious?  In college,  you get a Ziploc bag  and stuff food in there.  Hey,  Sam?  Yeah?  He hung up,  but Rob Cross just called,  and he said,  yeah,  buffet's motherfucker. 
[03:37:00]  He's on the buffet train here.  But,  Rob Cross can say motherfucker  about all the buffets  he wants to.  They're not more famous  in Vegas than shows.  I don't think so,  but they're very well known.  It's top three.  They're top three.  Gambling shows and buffets.  Celine Dion,  or the largest plate  of chicken fingers  you can eat.  Exactly.  There was a thing.  Like,  I think Penn and Teller  would be very insulted  that the lobster  is more famous  than they are.  No,  they're at the Rio.  It was one of the largest buffets. 
[03:37:30]  You know,  the Rio,  that place for buffets?  Yeah.  they got a couple magicians  on stage too.  Yeah.  Roland,  when was the last time  you went to Vegas?  Christmas.  All right.  Before that,  you did a trip  with your brother,  right?  Yeah.  Okay.  This was,  I don't know how many years ago,  but Roland just started  sending me photos  of him and his brother  at different buffets  that they were at  because he just told me  about these buffets.  And he's like,  no,  they're amazing.  I'll show you.  And then when he went out there,  he was just sending me photos  of him at different buffets.  I went from,  I toured up, 
[03:38:00]  I went from Green Valley Ranch  all the way to Rio,  Bellagio,  Paris.  Okay.  Turn that shit up.  Bubba in Texas.  Hey,  Sam.  Yeah.  You do remember  that the audience  is a bunch of fat fucks,  right?  Sometimes I forget.  That's why I need people  around me to remind me.  Well,  it's true though.  Like last time I went,  my buddy took me  to the buffet in Rio.  Wasn't that amazing?  Yeah,  it was,  well,  it was out of this world.  And we went to a couple  of other buffets,  so I can name  way more buffets  than I can show. 
[03:38:30]  Okay,  let's go,  you name a buffet,  I'll name a show.  You start.  Well,  the Rio.  Okay,  Penn and Teller.  The Mirage.  David Copperfield.  The Bellagio.  Celine Dion.  Bullshit.  Celine Dion's  not in Vegas right now.  Well,  I don't know if she,  yeah,  I think she is.  It's fine.  Cirque du Soleil.  No,  she is on Vegas.  And by the way,  I'm giving,  there's five different  Cirque du Soleil shows, 
[03:39:00]  so I'm giving you  a lot with that one.  All right.  The Orleans.  I've been there.  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  that was a good one.  Breakfast,  $5.99.  What's up?  Right.  Breakfast buffet,  baby.  Okay,  and Blue Man Group.  Paris.  You've not got me now.  The Paris buffet.  Okay,  the Paris buffet.  The Legend Show  with all the...  Stratosphere buffet.  Oh,  my God.  Frontier.  Luxor.  Excalibur.  Roland,  didn't you tell me  at one point  you would only gamble  just to get comped? 
[03:39:30]  Yes!  As soon as he got  the comp tickets  to the buffet,  he'd stop gambling.  How much is the buffet?  Well,  the Paris one  is up to like 50 bucks,  but when you play  a little bit,  they drop it down  to like 10 bucks.  How much do you have  to play?  More than 100 bucks.  It just doesn't  make any sense.  Bring calories.  Joker.  Hey,  Sam.  I'll make it real simple.  I used to work in Vegas.  Years past,  it was all about  gambling,  whores,  shows. 
[03:40:00]  Ten years ago,  they had the big idea  to make it more  family friendly,  turn it into more  of a family atmosphere,  and they brought in  a bunch of rides  and carnivals  and circus circus crap  and stuff like that,  and that's when  they turned it over  to the buffet.  Why would they build  a city around buffets?  I'm telling you,  that's what they've changed.  They've changed  the atmosphere.  Okay.  Like the Palms Buffet,  it's okay,  but then you just  go up down the street  and then you have  Caesars Palace, 
[03:40:30]  which is a good buffet,  go around the corner  from there,  you have your options  between a mirage  and all that.  I feel like I missed  the Vegas experience  because...  I'll take you to Vegas  and show you.  I fucked up.  Just wear,  you gotta wear  a deal of sweats, buddy.  Why?  It's because I'm  going to be expanding?  So you won't feel  yourself expanding,  you're like,  I'm okay.  I can keep going.  Yeah,  you don't want to wear pants,  you'll fucking be depressed.  How much damage  do you do at a buffet?  Dude.  Yeah?  Bad.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You'll get your $50 worth.  Oh,  I'll get more than that.  And put them out of business.  Well,  because they have 
[03:41:00]  the whole dessert,  they have like  one section of cakes,  one section of pies,  then they have cookies,  then they have ice creams,  yogurts,  they have Sunday section,  then you go around that  and then they have  like everything you want.  So when these UFC fighters  are trying to gain  all the weight back  after the weigh-ins,  just they have a buffet.  Vegas is the spot.  The Bellagio buffet  is one of the best ones.  It's amazing.  It is.  Like the top of the line  sushi,  steak,  caveat,  wherever you want.  I missed it.  I didn't even see  the buffet at the MGM. 
[03:41:30]  What did you see  in the new wing?  I don't know.  Did you go by  Emerald Lagasse's?  No.  Well,  you have to go  loop past the new  to the old  and then you have  to loop around  past Yellow Brick Road.  You know where  all the buffets are?  Fuck yeah,  you do.  You know where  every single buffet.  Yeah.  Joe in Boston,  you're on after  Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey guys,  I think Roland  completely appreciate this.  We used to go  to the Bellagio buffet  as like a $45  seafood buffet  or whatever,  like lobster,  you name it, 
[03:42:00]  they added.  And I had this  fucking weird friend  who used to go there  and you'd eat  as many pepperoni pizzas  as he could  for $45.  Like that's all  he would eat.  He'd be like  waving Alaskan  King Krab at his feet  and be like,  fuck you,  more pepperoni.  And he would try to  eat $50 worth  of pepperoni pizza?  Yeah,  but that's all.  I got one other  quick story about  this fucking kid.  We would go out  Friday night.  I would tell you  I was on a state  big party.  We'd go out  Friday night.  Like,  Paul,  are you coming?  No,  I'm going to stay home  and do the 30 rack challenge.  But consistent of him  sitting on the couch 
[03:42:30]  by himself,  watching at Santa  on repeat  and just trying  to down a 30 rack  by himself.  All Thursdays  between that  and the frenzy  of box of wine challenge  where he would try  to down those alone.  By himself.  Right.  Now,  that does sound  kind of like  paradise in the  Nagel household  the way he was  describing his  4th of July.  Why does that  bother you?  I just...  What we do?  Eric spent the  entire 4th of July  long weekend,  Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday,  Sunday,  just sitting at home. 
[03:43:00]  We went out  shopping and stuff,  but that's not  Mission Impossibles  and playing Legos  and eating pepperoni  pizzas and Coke floats  all day.  I saw Sam  on 4th of July.  Yeah,  and then,  I'll tell you what,  Eric,  you actually,  you sitting at home  and doing nothing  probably bothers me  more than this,  but it also bothers me  that we weren't  invited to the Nagel  4th of July party.  Sal,  did you get invited?  I did not.  What about to the  housewarming?  I'm going to the  housewarming.  But you didn't get  invited to the 4th of July?  No,  I'm kind of insulted 
[03:43:30]  that.  Because it wasn't a party.  You said you had  friends over.  It was a gathering.  How many people?  It was 4 or 5.  How many people?  That's about it.  5 people?  Yeah.  Plus you and your wife?  Yeah.  That's 7 people?  No, no, no,  including me and my wife.  Well,  then it was,  was it one couple?  Yeah,  one couple.  Plus who?  Who was the other guy?  Plus their kid.  Who was the couple?  So Dave and the kid?  No.  You're being so secretive.  It's not secretive.  What were their first names? 
[03:44:00]  It doesn't matter.  You won't even reveal  their first names?  No,  it doesn't matter.  How long have you been  doing this for?  First names are safe.  Or you just make it up.  You don't pretend you're  being some mysterious guy.  Tony and Tina.  There you go.  That's a wedding?  Oh my god,  that's the names you made up?  Listen,  I would just like to,  you know,  you blew,  Roland invited you to his house.  Yes,  and we were going to try to come,  but it was not going to happen.  Because they were closing stuff  on the west side and... 
[03:44:30]  Take a train!  We took a train.  Not from where I'm at.  I would have to go down  into the city  and then cut across  and it was just a pain.  You can't take a train  into the city  from your new place?  I guess there's one near me.  I don't know where the...  I don't know the schedule.  I cooked a feast.  But we talked to Roland  that morning and said,  look,  I don't think we're going  to be able to make this thing.  Because you had another party  that you were throwing  without any of us.  No.  And then we decided  to stay home.  We got some food  and what did you get?  We made kebabs. 
[03:45:00]  Your descriptions of things  are just funny.  Because you pause  and then you say it like,  we made kebabs.  Yeah, we had filet-tip kebabs.  We had grilled lemon chicken.  Well, Roland,  he lives in this building  in Queens  and he's got a roof space  that's like common space,  but it's just huge amounts of space.  It's not just like  some New York City roof.  There's like AstroTurf laid out 
[03:45:30]  and there's like eight different grills  and a bocce.  I thought it was a bocce ball court.  Yeah, and just tons of space  and everybody's up there.  So Roland, I guess,  decides at the last minute  that he's going to throw a barbecue  and he's having some people over  but he started panicking  on Tuesday, the third,  that he had all this stuff to do  and I'm like,  Roland,  you're inviting a few friends over.  Yeah, I was getting those texts  like, why am I doing this?  Why am I doing this?  Yeah, he went out.  He spent all day Friday 
[03:46:00]  or all day Tuesday  at the grocery store  buying shit.  Then he woke up early  at like seven o'clock in the morning  on Wednesday the fourth  and went to the grocery store  to buy more stuff.  He bought $200 worth of food.  There's like maybe six to eight of us  coming over  and it was just inundated.  I felt like I was in a Las Vegas buffet  when I got there  because he made,  first he made appetizers  which is like,  who throws a casual party 
[03:46:30]  with appetizers?  You have to have appetizers.  If you come to,  if you came to my house  and it was just me,  like Jess maybe,  but if I was throwing a party,  appetizers wouldn't even  enter into my mind at all.  Because you don't think  of other people, Sam.  No, because I'm not  a fucking fat ass  who thinks that appetizers  are so,  I'm not,  I'm not throwing a,  I had six different appetizers.  Yeah, he's got six appetizers.  He's got a different type  of appetizer  for every guest at the party.  Oh.  He had fried mozzarella balls. 
[03:47:00]  He had mac and cheese balls.  That's what I meant.  That's what I meant.  Mac and cheese balls.  That sounds good.  Fried cheese.  Spinach dip.  He had spinach dip.  He had chicken nuggets.  Then the spinach,  like frittata,  like a little spinach.  Yeah, spinach frittata.  Roland, you'll be happy.  There are multiple appetizers  at the party this weekend.  He, he,  and then he made the meal.  He made,  he started grilling burgers  and then,  and then after burgers  was the sliders  and cheeseburgers 
[03:47:30]  and steak.  Chicken.  And he made chicken.  Three different kinds  of french fries.  He made three different  kinds of french fries  and everybody's just looking  and I cared to guess.  And there were all,  I'm hungry.  I didn't eat this morning.  Do you want to guess  which fries?  Yes, you may guess.  I want to see what he knows  how to cook.  Okay, yes,  you may guess which fries.  I'm sure he just made  regular fries, one.  That's one.  Did you make sweet potato fries?  No.  You have two more guesses.  That was your one throwaway. 
[03:48:00]  What about those fries  with the truffle oil?  No.  The answer is  regular fries,  shoestring fries,  and waffle fries.  That was my next guess,  waffle fries.  Yeah, but you missed out  because you had one throwaway,  not two throwaways.  Because I thought Roland  would have went a little higher  on the appetizer scale there.  Roland's figuring  an all-American barbecue  for 600 people.  Way to go.  And chicken fingers too.  Yeah, chicken, yeah.  And then,  I mean,  he had  eight different kinds of soda, 
[03:48:30]  booze,  tons of beer,  chips all over the table.  How many different kinds of chips?  Eight.  Eight different kinds of chips.  Like,  how much leftovers  did you have after that?  My doorman was very,  very pleased.  I would imagine.  He was like,  what's up?  It was way too much  for this party to eat.  But it was great.  Everybody had a great time.  Yeah.  And everybody left very full.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Very full.  I don't want to take naps.  So you'd be pissed  if you went to a party  and there were no appetizers?  I would be pissed.  I would probably text Eric  going,  what the fuck am I at?  Eric,  you would have feelings?  Yeah.  Well,  I went to your house  with Jess  and we went to dinner  and you didn't give us  any appetizers  when we got there.  Because it wasn't a party.  Oh.  So if it's a...  Hey,  you're coming over  because we were going  to take you to dinner.  So what if  the party's at the restaurant?  Like,  what if that time  we had my birthday party  and we went to a restaurant?  That's okay 
[03:49:30]  because the restaurant  takes care of the appetizers.  Well,  they provide a menu  with appetizers.  Okay.  Now,  what about...  What do you want appetizers  for anyway?  You only eat like three things.  Yeah,  but everything I eat  is technically an appetizer.  Yeah.  So I don't...  Entrees are where I have trouble.  Appetizers I'm good with.  Just so you know,  when we were planning stuff  this weekend  for next weekend  and we were going over  the food menu and whatnot,  my wife was taking  into consideration  things that Sam could eat  and I had to remind her  Sam will not be there. 
[03:50:00]  Well,  I wish that you and your wife  would take into consideration  that Comic-Con  is a very publicized event.  It's very well known.  The dates are not a mystery  and you've known...  You and your wife,  I'm talking to your wife too,  have both known for some time  that Jim Norton and myself  are going to be in San Diego.  San Diego this weekend.  Or perhaps another time.  I wish that...  That is a consideration  that I'd be more flattered by  than just,  let's fry up some chicken.  You know what I mean?  Because guess what?  The food that I like,  everybody likes.  Nobody is like, 
[03:50:30]  oh, gross.  Chicken fingers.  They're like,  oh, cool.  You know?  And then they want to know,  well, what are we having  for the rest of the meal?  What else is there?  Yeah.  Sam's like,  what are you talking about?  I'm done.  Exactly.  I'd be like,  wow, Eric,  dinner so early.  Waffle fries and chicken fingers,  all done.  Well,  that's what I've also learned to do  when I go to parties.  I go heavy on the appetizers  because I know  the entree  is just going to be  me mixing it up  on my plate  and just kind of  pushing it off to the...  Yeah,  I ate some of it.  It was great.  But for Sam,  we got grilled chicken,  chicken fingers.  I made sure you're taking care of it. 
[03:51:00]  You did.  You did.  You're very,  very considerate.  I went to  Roland's apartment,  obviously,  because,  you know,  we checked out his apartment.  He gave us the grand tour.  He doesn't have  anything.  Roland gets free stuff  every day.  I don't know where  any of it goes.  It goes to his doorman  is where it goes.  You just give it everything  to your doorman?  Because you go into  Roland's apartment.  The kitchen is very well  taken care of.  Like,  you can tell that  that's what he cares about  because beyond the kitchen 
[03:51:30]  is simply his living room  that has,  it's hardwood floors,  no carpeting,  and there is nothing  in the room  except for a couch,  a TV stand,  an Xbox with a controller  and the headset,  and a disgustingly large  3D  smart TV  that has a remote  with keys on it.  Just unnecessary.  Then you go into his bedroom  and it's just a bed 
[03:52:00]  with plain white sheets  and shoes lined up  on the other side.  Nothing is in there.  And then you go  into the bathroom  and Sal,  you guessed.  His bathroom,  everything matches.  The shower curtain  matches the towels,  matches the soap dispenser,  matches the washcloth,  everything matches.  What do you think  was decorated with?  Springsteen.  Eric,  do you know the answer?  I think I did at one point.  It's some sports team, right? 
[03:52:30]  It's with Jets, probably.  The answer is  Mickey Mouse.  What?  Roland has an entire  Mickey Mouse bathroom.  And I don't mean that  in the sense like  this fucking Mickey Mouse operation.  I mean,  everything has a Mickey Mouse logo on  in Roland's bathroom.  What's up?  He's got nothing.  He doesn't own anything  except for a TV  that he spent  way too much money on.  And he's got a computer.  He's got an iMac  that's sitting on his  kitchen counter  with no chair.  So he has to stand 
[03:53:00]  at his kitchen counter  when he uses his computer.  And you can tell  he's never on it.  It wasn't even on  when I got there.  His computer was off.  Whose computer is off  in their apartment anymore?  You always just have  your computer on  because you just used it.  No matter what time of day it is,  you just used your computer.  But it's a good view.  What?  The apartment?  Oh yeah,  it's a beautiful apartment.  The view,  you can see everything?  The view is nice.  The TV 3D is awesome.  Yeah,  I mean,  I guess...  You were there,  so you thought that...  And I will tell you this,  I put the 3D glasses on  and I enjoyed 
[03:53:30]  the 3D experience.  But,  there was no part of me  that said,  I gotta get home  and buy one of those  3D televisions  because I'm really  missing out.  Because there's no  programming in 3D.  No.  You just,  if you want to enjoy  the 3D experience,  you have to put in  the 3D preview disc  that Roland has  for his 3D Blu-ray player.  Yeah.  But doesn't he have  3D movies?  Yeah,  I have a,  just Transformers.  He just watches  Transformers nonstop.  And,  of course, 
[03:54:00]  what's on when I get there  is one,  like,  I want to see  Roland's giant TV  and I want  looking back at me  some douchebag  with bleach blonde  highlights,  jingling wrists  from all his jewelry  and a flame shirt.  Guy,  goddamn Fieri  is looking back at me.  Yeah,  Triple D,  I love the Food Network.  Of course you do.  But,  yeah,  you have a,  I'm going to buy furniture.  You're a,  are you?  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  Why?  Because I realized my,  there's nothing there?  Well,  some of my buddy goes,  so you could open the door  and go,  oh my god,  is this apartment robbed?  Like,  one time,  it does,  it does.  It looks like the type of,  like,  if Roland left his door unlocked,  somebody would be like,  oh shit,  let's rob this guy.  They'd open his apartment  and say,  oh wow,  somebody already got it.  One time the apartment  got confused,  they opened my door  and they showed it,  they thought it was like,  like a display apartment,  but like,  no,  that's my apartment.  Oh,  sorry.  There's an apartment next door.  They were bringing potential  movers in in there. 
[03:55:00]  I guess they put a TV in here.  You do have the television.  Yeah.  That's all you need,  TV.  And a Mickey Mouse bathroom?  Yeah.  You like Mickey?  Love Mickey.  You do?  Yeah.  I never knew that.  Yeah,  Disney World,  I love going there.  You do?  Yeah.  How many times have you been?  Disneyland,  probably a show a lot of times.  What about Disney World?  Oh,  last time I went there  was like a few years ago.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  You should go with me and Jess then.  I'm in.  John in Miami,  you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey,  Roland,  I was on your side  until you said 
[03:55:30]  you had eight different types  of potato chips.  It's not a fucking party,  that's a 7-Eleven.  It is.  Roland just bought the snack aisle.  Well,  it's for the different dips.  It's a different ship for the dip.  Way to go,  Roland.  Yeah,  but Sam,  Sam,  you're such a cheap motherfucker.  I bet you got beautiful china,  but when you have your party,  it's served on that shit paper plate.  First of all,  I do not have any china.  It seems an impractical investment. 
[03:56:00]  Second of all,  yeah,  it was probably a wedding gift,  correct?  Oh,  oh,  no,  I didn't let Jess put any china  on the registry  because I was like,  listen,  some idiot is actually  going to buy us this china  instead of giving us a check.  That's what my registry  consisted of.  My registry said,  Chase,  Bank of America,  Merrill Lynch,  checks.  You cheap motherfucker.  Now,  if I throw a party,  it's going to be,  first of all,  a wonderful party. 
[03:56:30]  There will be a bag  of Lay's potato chips  or whatever is on sale  that week  ready for anyone to enjoy.  All the homemade soda  you can drink.  That's right.  Homemade soda  at the Roberts household.  I loved it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You converted me.  Roland had some fresh  club soda.  It's like the best club soda.  It's like so easy.  Right out of the tap,  couple button pushes,  put that CO2 in there  thanks to the soda stream,  thanks to the  soda maker  that I got for the wedding  and boom. 
[03:57:00]  Then,  then I'll use my other  wedding gift  which I got from  the Nagel household  and I will make you  a nice pizza pie.  Oh,  the pizza board.  Use Pillsbury dough,  throw some,  whatever the cheapest  pizza sauce is  and I don't know,  I don't know,  put some string cheese  down on top of it  and there we go.  A nice pizza pie  to go with it.  You want to come over,  John?  Hell no.  Okay.  You're not invited.  Max in Dallas.  Hey, 
[03:57:30]  what's going on,  man?  Roland,  I love you to death,  dude.  I don't blame you.  Food it up,  buddy,  but it sounds like  you're living in a damn  CIA safe house.  Yeah,  it really was.  It was a temporary  living establishment.  That's why I'm  going to buy furniture  now.  I mean,  I guess,  and then Roland told me  that,  and he doesn't have a TV  in his bedroom either.  No,  because then I'll never  leave my bedroom.  So at least I have to  get up and walk around.  No,  because you told me  that you fall asleep  on your couch now.  Yeah,  you just never leave  the living room.  Yeah.  It's just funny. 
[03:58:00]  But I am going to buy  furniture like next month.  They're going to remodel  my whole apartment.  Who is?  The building.  They're going to each  apartment and remodeling them.  What do you mean remodeling?  New floors,  new kitchen appliances,  new everything.  Everything looked brand new  when I was in there.  I take care of it,  yeah.  Oh,  it's not that new?  A year?  It's still only a year old.  Why are they remodeling it?  Just to bring up  the property value?  Yep.  Is your rent going to go up?  Hell yeah.  Okay,  so I was about to say,  you come up to benefit. 
[03:58:30]  No,  they're doing new washer dryers  and everything.  So basically,  they said,  if you need a storage facility,  you could do it.  I'm like,  I'm good.  Yeah,  you're good to go.  I'm good.  A storage facility.  What are you doing  with that shoebox?  So once they're done  remodeling it,  I'm going to go buy furniture.  Do you hate having things?  Do you throw everything out?  I just like,  I don't know.  I know the people enjoy it more.  So when you had to move,  you said when you moved  from your last place,  it was in the middle  of the hurricane.  Yeah,  it was only 15, 
[03:59:00]  20 boxes.  Yeah,  you were talking about  what a pain in the ass it is.  It is,  because I had to go from,  it was 150 stairs.  You could spit all your possessions  in a carry-on.  You don't have anything.  It says they're in the closet.  Did he show you  his cotton candy maker?  Yeah,  where was all that stuff?  That one was broken,  I had to get rid of it.  Yeah,  I didn't see any cotton candy maker,  I didn't see any deep fryer,  I didn't see shit.  Everything was put away  in the cabinets.  Oh.  I keep everything clean,  looking.  The one I need,  I pull it out.  The hot dog roller? 
[03:59:30]  That's in the cabinets.  Is it?  Yeah,  I put everything in the cabinets.  Why didn't you pull that shit  out for the party?  That's a fun party.  Like,  roll some hot dogs?  Then people would stay  in my apartment,  and I wanted them upstairs.  Didn't Roland also have  a professional meat slicer?  Yeah,  that's in the side.  You still have all that stuff  in your apartment?  Yeah,  they're all in the cabinets,  all over the kitchen.  You also had a thing  that made snow cones  or something.  Yeah,  that's in the box still.  It's still in a box?  Yeah.  You haven't made any snow cones  since you moved in?  I'm not trying to lose weight,  that's tough, man.  It's tough with a snow cone maker  in the house, isn't it?  It's tough with all those toys 
[04:00:00]  in there.  Let me see.  I would like a sandwich.  I have an entire pig here,  so let me slice it up.  Can't you just buy sliced meat?  Sounds good,  is it?  Yeah.  It's like having  freshly made club soda.  Yeah.  It's a difference,  isn't it?  Huge,  because you can roast  your own meat,  and you slice it  to the thickness you like.  Yeah.  Eric knows,  a good sandwich,  man,  it's like a million dollars.  Eric,  you do know that,  don't you?  That is true.  We both were picky.  We had our sandwich places  in Jersey.  You don't,  Eric,  when you're sitting there  all weekend,  I guess it's also because 
[04:00:30]  it's a completely  foreign concept to me,  because the Vegas trip,  UFC hooked us up  amazingly,  and we had access  to everything.  Jim Burns the man.  Jim Burns was great,  Reed Harris is great,  and another thing,  this after show,  when I'm doing it,  I feel like  none of it matters,  because I guess,  because listen,  most of the people  in this building  don't listen to the show.  No.  So I feel like  nobody's listening,  because I never get feedback.  Nobody ever comes up to me 
[04:01:00]  and goes,  you know,  Sam,  you did a good job  on the air today.  I've never heard that  from anybody who works here.  Maybe it's because  I don't do a good job,  but I've never heard,  I've never heard anybody  who is in a supervising position  to me say,  you did a great job on the air.  Even when I'm on the air,  like when Obi's not here,  or when Anthony's on here,  and I'm on the air  for the whole main show,  I've never actually heard  somebody say,  you did a good job  on the air today.  So I don't know,  but that makes me think  that it just,  nobody's listening to anything. 
[04:01:30]  And then I get out there,  and I feel so much pressure  now attached to this show.  It started when like  Otto called in,  and he goes,  yeah,  I was just listening,  and I was like,  what the fuck?  Otto from Otto and George  is listening to this?  That's like a celebrity.  I can't believe this.  Then,  I get to UFC in Vegas  this weekend,  and Reed Harris,  who's like second in command,  he was just controlling  everything for Dana,  for Dana White  over at the UFC Fan Expo  and the whole thing.  Reed Harris is like  talking about 
[04:02:00]  the stuff I do on the air  without me explaining  who I am.  He's saying,  he's talking about  me bringing the interns in  and stuff like that.  He's talking about  how he listens  to the after show.  And I'm like,  oh my God.  Then,  then,  we go out to dinner,  and it's,  you know,  it's me  and Bobby Kelly  and Jim  and Anthony  and Joe Rogan  and his,  and his crew.  And from across the table,  Joe goes,  Sam,  you host the after show,  right?  And I was like,  yeah.  And he goes,  yeah,  man,  you're doing a good job  with that.  I listen. 
[04:02:30]  And I'm like,  Jesus Christ,  now you put the pressure  on me.  That's a huge name  now to add to your  celebrity list.  I can't have these people  actually listening to this.  I know.  This is like,  I'm sitting here  talking to Roland  about buffets.  But at least you know  that down the hall  and was listening.  Yeah,  they don't mind.  They don't even know Joe Rogan.  I just told them  Joe Rogan listens.  They put me real swift  on the pay no mind list.  Fuck,  what was there?  Obi's not yelling  at me about it?  No problem.  But yeah,  I mean,  that's a lot of pressure now. 
[04:03:00]  The Yankees people  listen to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then when a guy  like Louis CK  comes in here  and he's like,  yeah,  I listen to this show  almost every day  talking about  Opie and Anthony,  not this horse shit.  But even when he's  talking about  Opie and Anthony,  that means that  when I'm opening  my stupid mouth  on Opie and Anthony,  someone like Louis CK  is listening?  That's a lot of pressure.  I never think about it.  I usually just think  it's Lady Trucker,  some guy in Boston,  and Roland in the office  listening,  and that's it.  You know?  People at Bruce 
[04:03:30]  listen to you.  That's...  You remember  when we had Bruce,  people would say,  hey, Sam.  Yeah.  Scary, Roland.  I know.  I don't know what to do.  I mean,  it makes me think  I need to increase  the quality control here.  Or get a nice sandwich.  Or get a nice sandwich.  I don't know.  Like,  and it makes me,  now I'm thinking,  you know,  is somebody like Joe Rogan  going to want to sit around  and listen to me  talking to Roland  about where he hides  his meat slicer  in his apartment?  But I can't think like that.  Maybe if he's high.  You know what? 
[04:04:00]  Yeah,  maybe he's getting stoned  right now.  He's hungry.  Those guys are crazy.  He's sitting there like,  I could go for a sandwich.  Maybe,  I feel like we've set  the precedent.  It's a very low precedent  that we've set.  The bar's been set low,  but this is just  what the after show is.  And people just have to,  you know,  get on board with it.  It's a lot of pressure.  It's scary.  I know.  You're the captain of the chip.  The chip?  What's the chip?  The chip.  What's that?  The chip.  Speaking of chip,  what did I learn today?  How about Chip Chipperson's 
[04:04:30]  new catchphrase?  E-Rock?  What,  you want me to do it?  No,  I want you to,  do you think this is going  to catch on?  Um,  um,  I think unwillingly  it will catch on.  I'm positive it's going  to catch on because  by the end of day one  in Vegas,  all of us were just going,  that don't make no sense.  Everywhere.  Because he does it everywhere.  Once Chip starts doing it,  and he will start doing it,  everywhere. 
[04:05:00]  And you're going to be saying it,  you're going to be bringing it home.  You know,  I mean,  It's going to show up on t-shirts.  It's going to be echoing  through Roland's empty apartment  because everything does,  there's nothing in there.  It does echo a lot.  Um,  but yeah,  like,  but that's why,  we were so busy out in Vegas,  uh,  because of everything UFC  hooked us up with.  We did,  you know,  the fan expo,  and the weigh-ins,  and the actual fight itself,  and we were in the media room,  we went to the press conference,  and we went out to dinner,  and we saw Dice.  We did all this stuff,  you know,  we spent two hours  recapping Vegas on the show today. 
[04:05:30]  Listen to the replay  if you didn't catch it.  But,  it was so busy  to come back.  That's why I was,  uh,  I don't know if  taking it back  is the right word,  when Eric was like,  yep,  just sit around  watching Mission Impossible movies  and playing Legos.  It was like,  you couldn't have done something?  Troy and I,  we didn't see Roger Waters.  You did?  Yeah.  How was he?  It was awesome.  I didn't know what to expect,  but it was amazing.  I saw pictures of Troy  on Troy's Instagram,  uh,  hiking through the mountains  in Pennsylvania.  Yeah,  well,  he went to Pennsylvania  and then he came back  for,  uh, 
[04:06:00]  Waters.  That's why he couldn't go  to your 4th of July party  because he was hiking  through the mountains?  Yeah,  he was experiencing nature.  I guess so.  Eric,  did that ever,  uh,  Nope.  You have no interest.  The beach is about as far  as I'll go with nature.  I'm not going through  the fucking woods.  No,  you're climbing a mountain.  But he was under a waterfall.  Yeah,  and that looked great.  I mean,  good for him.  Yeah,  can I get a ride  to the waterfall?  only the Irish Spring commercial 
[04:06:30]  is all I do.  But,  you know,  seeing it on Instagram,  you know,  need was fulfilled.  You're a pool guy.  You don't need,  uh,  well,  will you walk the shore  on the beach?  Yeah,  I'll walk the beach.  Yeah.  Is Troy's listening?  He should come in here.  He'll tell you about the,  about what?  He has a picture  of his girlfriend  peeing.  What?  His girlfriend,  he took a picture  of his girlfriend peeing?  Troy just gave you  a dirty look.  You took a picture  of your girlfriend  peeing in the woods?  Oh,  yeah. 
[04:07:00]  You want to see it?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  I do.  It's hilarious.  That,  because Troy loved Roger Water.  He took good pictures.  Yeah,  I wanted to Instagram it,  but she was like,  don't you fucking dare do this.  Can I Instagram her pictures  from the photo booth  at the wedding?  Uh,  does Instagram allow nipples?  I don't know.  Trucker Kyle.  Sam,  just call him to see,  tell you how good  job you're doing today  on the show.  Oh my God,  now you're giving me  this kind of pressure too?  Oh my God.  Let me take a look at this. 
[04:07:30]  Oh,  Trucker Kyle.  That's awesome.  You got to see this picture.  There's a picture  of,  of,  uh,  Troy's girlfriend.  There's another one too  if you want to see it.  Sam,  let me put,  let me pre-preface.  Look,  she's just smiling.  What are you doing?  There's her underwear,  pink underwear,  right?  Yeah.  Sam,  we were all eating dinner  at the,  before the Roger Waters  and Troy goes,  I got to show you guys  a picture.  And she was there?  Yeah,  she was there.  I was showing the,  the Stortis girl.  The server.  The server.  Troy goes,  hey,  hey,  look at this.  Look at this.  Was she happy  that you showed the picture? 
[04:08:00]  She was cool.  She doesn't give a fuck.  No.  I wanted Instagram.  She's like,  don't,  don't put that up  on your Instagram.  No,  but it's during dinner  that we're like eating food  and then Troy goes,  hey,  look at this.  There's something hot  about this picture.  Yeah,  did you show them  the second picture?  It was funny.  Yeah,  I'm looking at the second  picture right now.  Yeah,  there's something hot  about that.  It's hilarious too.  It is,  but when you're eating  like a steak  and then you see,  like,  all right,  and then you have to  look up and talk,  talk to her.  You're like,  okay. 
[04:08:30]  I was at Dorney Park.  Wild Water Kingdom.  My girlfriend's never  been to a water park  so I took her  to a water park.  That was fun.  And then I came back,  Roger Waters with Roland.  He had a fucking blast,  dude.  We had a blast,  man.  It was so much fun.  Good.  And then Roland and I  actually hung out  on Saturday.  Roland and I,  this was like a Troy and Roland.  You were broing down?  We were screaming, bro.  Yeah,  we were broing down hard.  Eric,  this is what happens.  And then you stop me  and then we went to  the tacos.  I showed him a new taco spot.  Fucking amazing tacos. 
[04:09:00]  Eric,  you stopped inviting us  over to your house  because you want to  separate your radio friends  and your real friends  and now,  look at this.  Last weekend,  Roland is hitting up  Westchester.  This weekend,  Troy and Roland  are broing down.  Nobody was not  invited to my house.  Yeah,  we were.  Troy,  you got invited on the 4th?  No.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah,  but we discussed on the show  that's stupid to do.  To separate your friends  like that?  No,  no,  just to be like,  oh,  yeah,  like whatever,  dude.  I'm not just going to  show up at Eric's house.  Or we will  and he'll be like,  what are you doing here? 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  Everybody was invited  to the party this Saturday.  Not July 4th.  Sam,  and I pulled this kid's  splash.  Kid splashed you?  Well,  this little kid was like  walking by  and then he's splashing me,  he's kicking me  and I was trying to  catch his leg  in the water.  I don't know,  five,  five or something.  And so I was trying  to catch his leg  and then I was screaming  at this,  I was just,  I was riled up.  Oh,  yeah,  he was just like,  hey,  hey,  yo,  yo.  You're a liability, 
[04:10:00]  Troy.  Listen,  we got to cut it off here.  Oh man,  those tacos.  I hope everybody  a good 4th of July.  Tacombie tacos  is the best tacos  in New York City.  All right,  with the plugola.  Is that plugola?  Yes,  because you're going to  try to get free tacos  out of that.  That's what plugola is.  Dude,  O&I would love  these fucking tacos.  We're not doing  another bad food segment  so Rolly can get  free tacos.  No,  it's for everybody.  For everybody.  There'll be tacos  for you too.  Listen,  the sauce guys  came in here.  You eat crispy fish,  right?  Like fried fish?  No, I'm not going to eat crispy fish. 
[04:10:30]  No, you eat fried fish, right?  You eat chicken.  Listen,  the chicken tacos  is so fucking good.  The meat sauce guys  came in here.  It's a shitty radio segment.  Also,  you could get some meat sauce.  They did not perform well  on this show.  The corn tacos?  That was fucking amazing.  They didn't perform.  Eric,  what'd you like?  What was your favorite one?  Eric,  you know radio.  Was that a good segment?  It was a delicious segment  but not good on the air.  Horrible radio.  Horrible.  But I would like tacos.  We're not doing that shit here.  Make the host happy.  Make the host happy.  The listeners need to stop  being so greedy about  good radio.  Let the fucking host  be happy for a minute. 
[04:11:00]  The host can be happy.  I had an LBS.  I have a little blood sugar.  Listen,  we have to go  because now you're being selfish  because Ron and Fezz  are going to start.  Stay tuned for that.  Hope you had a good fourth  and all that stuff.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show  is now over.  For real this time.
