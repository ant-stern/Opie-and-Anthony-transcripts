<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a detailed discussion of XM's appearance on Donald Trump's *The Apprentice*.  The hosts, along with XM executive Elo, dissected the episode, mocking Elo's heavy makeup, the bizarre song-writing challenge, Lee Abrams' apparent inebriation, and the contestants' performances.  Listener calls followed, reacting primarily to Elo's appearance.  They also discussed an *Apprentice*-related after-show they recorded with guests Jaday, Levi, and Stacy.  An interview with Trump on another XM channel was also mentioned.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to the successful ambush of Howard Stern by Opie and Anthony listeners ("pests" or the "ONA Army") outside David Letterman's studio. The hosts recounted the event with glee, sharing photos, and detailing the listeners' coordinated attack.  Listener Paul, a participant, called in to describe the prank, including a physical altercation.  The hosts contrasted their listeners' fervent loyalty with Stern's declining popularity, evidenced by smaller crowds at his recent appearances.  The graphic descriptions of a female performer's body odor, reported by an intern who was tasked with smelling her, also featured prominently in this section, generating humorous disgust from the hosts. This segment included sexually explicit language and vulgar descriptions.

The show then shifted gears to promote upcoming segments, including a "homeless shopping spree" and the second annual eggnog-drinking contest. Pat from Wynaki, the reigning champion, called in, along with numerous other listeners boasting about their eggnog consumption capabilities.

A substantial segment focused on the upcoming broadcast of Earl Douglas's "Black Rock Coalition," a two-hour show featuring Black artists. Opie and Anthony expressed significant skepticism and mocked the concept, suggesting a "White Rapper Coalition" as a counterpoint.  They compared Earl to "Rudy" from the movie *Rudy*.  Discussions of potential future show ideas, including two-hour slots for "pests," and potential show names like "Than and Dan Show" ensued.  A caller brought up past unsuccessful radio ventures involving Black personalities, reinforcing their doubts.  This segment also contained sexually suggestive exchanges about Opie's cook, a played clip of "Fag Talk," and a sexually explicit conversation with a blind female caller, Krista, who sought masturbation advice, guided by the hosts and a male caller. Clay from *The Apprentice* also called in.  Bill Burr was mentioned as a guest and promoted his upcoming performances.

A seemingly unrelated discussion about bear hunting in New Jersey transitioned into a studio segment where Danny painted a bullseye on Anthony's face. This led to the arrival of two female pornographic film performers, Flower and Selena.  The show then featured a highly sexually explicit conversation with the two women, detailing their sexual experiences and preferences in graphic detail, including anal sex, squirting, double penetration, and one woman's claim of squirting up to 17 feet.  One woman squirted semen onto Anthony's face.  The women promoted their websites. A prank call to one woman's mother was played. The segment concluded with the "F.U." segment, a discussion of the "Black Rock Coalition," its arch-enemy (whose identity was withheld), and dangerous children's toys.


The final segment highlighted the hosts' frustration with the absences of several regular contributors, including Jimmy Norton and Earl.  They recounted an offensive comment made by a female guest on a previous show about their dating habits.  A promotion for the Jägermeister Music Tour featuring Disturbed and COC, with a call-in contest for VIP tickets, and Bill Burr’s upcoming performances and appearance on the Greg Geraldo show were included.  Further announcements included Earl's upcoming show, other shows and events, birthdays, and an upcoming appearance at a comic book convention featuring Carrie Fisher. The show concluded with farewells and nonsensical chatter.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  And these dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open. 
[00:03:00]  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery race.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show. 
[00:03:30]  Okay, terrific. 
[00:04:00]  I'm just going to get something to eat.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot.  Let's do it.  All right, let's do it.  It's Friday.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Friday.  Oh, those guys are faggot.  Oh, we're both pushing buttons at the same goddamn time.  I had a thing going.  I was doing a, you had something going?  Don't you, faggot. 
[00:04:30]  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Oh, those guys are faggot.  Say it was like a triple thing.  I know, I'm sorry.  It was a little low in the mix.  I didn't really hear it.  And then I hit this.  It's Friday.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you, XM. 
[00:05:00]  It was a huge, huge day for XM yesterday.  Oh, just huge.  It was huge.  Huge.  XM being featured on The Apprentice.  That's a nice hit.  That's a nice hit for the company.  Kept me away.  Made me watch it.  I had to tune in to see Elo on TV.  And Lee Abrams.  Lee Abrams, who looked really, really high and didn't say much.  Donald just looked like he didn't want to deal with Lee. 
[00:05:30]  Huh?  The Donald looked like he didn't really want to deal with Lee.  He doesn't want to be bothered with potheads.  He's like Elo.  If he hangs out with potheads or talks to potheads ever, he doesn't have time for that.  Elo looked like a contestant on the show.  Yeah, he really did.  Elo didn't even look like a real, genuine, like, executive.  He looked like a contestant.  Like, they should have, like, maybe Donald could have fired him at any moment.  I have a feeling there may have been a little meeting behind the scenes.  Really? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, Donald Trump is always looking for that executive type.  Oh, oh.  That young go-getter.  Hope we don't lose Elo to the Trump organization.  With the perfect hair, the perfect makeup, the perfect suit.  Perfect makeup.  They put so much makeup on Elo.  I was cracking up for the first shot.  He had the Ronald Reagan going with the rouge.  They did one close-up on him, and he had so much rouge on his cheeks.  It was that typical.  Remember what they used to do to Reagan? 
[00:06:30]  They just rosy up his cheeks.  They did the same thing to him.  He was wearing, like, eyeliner.  I don't know what the hell they had on him.  Yeah, they were trying to, I don't know.  Gussy him up.  Yeah, they gussied him up all right.  So, the show in general was interesting, I guess.  I didn't really get the whole challenge behind this one.  And I understand Trump is looking for executives, somebody to hire.  Right.  For his organization. 
[00:07:00]  Hence, The Apprentice.  Yeah.  How does that tie in to writing a song and being able to pick out a talented music artist?  I mean, that's like taking a band and then saying, all right, put a presentation together  for this car company.  You know, you wouldn't know what the fuck you're doing.  Yeah, it didn't make sense on a few levels, I guess.  And annoying as shit, that woman on the crutches, just watching her gimp around. 
[00:07:30]  Well, she's going to win the whole thing.  Just throw her out and get a bitch that can walk every time.  The door opens, here she comes, hobbling through.  What happened to her leg?  She broke her leg as part of The Apprentice.  They were doing some skating thing with the Islanders.  A skating thing and she breaks her leg?  She broke her leg.  She started The Apprentice this season walking fine.  She was fine.  And then with one of the things they had to do, she broke her ankle.  And now she's hobbling around for the rest of the season. 
[00:08:00]  They probably told her, look, you'll win, just don't sue us.  She's going to win or the black guy's going to win?  I don't know the black guy's name.  The black guy was almost out yesterday.  I know.  Last night, whatever.  He fucked up a little bit.  Fucked up.  But they all fucked up.  The whole goal was they split into two teams, obviously.  Sorry.  Oh, no.  I'm way too distracted.  I'm sorry.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island and then we'll get back to what you were saying.  Go ahead, Rob.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, it might be just me, but didn't you look like Christopher Guest last night? 
[00:08:30]  Why didn't you know his ex-husband?  Christopher Guest?  Not Christopher Guest.  David Guest.  David Guest.  Or something like that.  Christopher Guest using Spinal Tap.  All he had to say was Liza Minnelli's ex-husband.  No.  A little bit.  Elo looked fine.  There was too much makeup on him.  Wrong.  But he just looked like Elo.  His hair looked okay.  Well, that was the new haircut.  And next to Lee Abrams, you know, anyone.  Did Lee Abrams even know where he was? 
[00:09:00]  No.  The mad scientist?  Did he say anything?  Barely.  He barely said a thing.  Kind of sat there.  He looked like he was petrified that he was on TV.  Yeah.  They showed some reaction shots and I'm just kind of looking up at Trump while he was talking  and he just looked like he didn't know where he was.  It's fantastic.  I gotta love XM.  Jen in Philly.  Jen.  Hey boys.  How you doing?  We're doing good, Jen.  I just wanted to say, Elo is hot.  I'd do him. 
[00:09:30]  Wow.  You're an Elo fan, huh?  Oh, I never saw a picture of him before.  I love him.  I think he's adorable.  Aww.  Didn't he look like a little kid in a suit?  He did.  Can you believe that's like one of our bosses?  He did.  It was like, my girlfriend was saying, if you take him out of that suit and just put  him in like frat wear.  Yeah.  He just looked like a college kid.  He's the young go-getter.  He certainly is.  I believe he's younger than us.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[00:10:00]  And he's running the entire company.  Yeah.  He's the guy.  All right.  Well, Jen, would you like to have an affair with Elo?  He is married.  I am married.  I couldn't do that.  Why not?  Why not?  Who's looking?  Yeah.  Who's looking?  He's married.  You're married.  You keep it all on the QT.  I was raised Catholic.  Like, there's that big guilt factor involved.  Nah.  Elo.  Hey, buddy.  You want something for the side there?  Do I want something for the side? 
[00:10:30]  I could use a throat lozenge right now, actually.  What's the matter?  Oh, we had a big party here last night.  Oh, hey.  Did you guys have a viewing party?  Oh, yeah.  You know, that's what you do.  You have a viewing party.  That's what you do.  You have a viewing party.  And then we did a show that's on, actually, it's airing next hour on XM200 all weekend,  where we had Jaday here and Levi here and some lady from the, I can't remember, Stacy,  I think it was, from Apprentice Season 2 was here.  And Lou Brutus interviewed everybody. 
[00:11:00]  And we told stories of what actually happened when the cameras were off and what scenes they  deleted that it didn't show.  Right.  How they edited it to make it look a little different.  Behind the scenes, Apprentice.  Yes.  There you go.  And that's going to be on 200 later on this morning?  Actually, yeah, the three-hour block.  There's an hour interview with Jaday, an hour interview with Levi, then there's the After  the Apprentice show that actually airs every three hours on XM200 this morning all the  way through Sunday night.  Hey, Elo, I guess the Trumpster was making the rounds on some of the XM channels yesterday? 
[00:11:30]  Yes, he was.  Besides ours?  Because as I'm driving home, I'm going through the decades, right?  And I hit on the 60s.  He was there.  And it's Flash Phelps, is that his name?  PHP.  PHP.  Yeah, Flash Phelps.  He's, you know, one of these 60s jocks and does the whole act.  He's pretty good at doing the whole 60s radio type feel and sound to it.  So he's got Trump on and he's interviewing Trump.  And I guess one thing he does is inducts people into, like, this little club he's got. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, the Flash.  The PHP club.  The PHP club.  And he's got to recite this little thing.  And Trump agrees to it, not knowing that this fucking pledge goes on forever.  It goes on forever.  So Trump starts out with a good sense of humor.  And he starts going.  And then it just kept going on and on and on.  And then he's supposed to make some wacky sound at the end.  And Trump didn't do it.  So finally, at the end of this thing, Flash goes, well, Mr. Trump, thank you for being here.  He goes, well, thank you for having me. 
[00:12:30]  And then you hear, like, they didn't turn the mic off.  And you hear Trump go, oh, that was a rough one.  I was cracking up.  Oh, my God.  He's like, oh, that was a rough one.  And Flash is like, hey, what do you mean by that?  Like, you know, being all zany and stuff.  And then goes into, you know, some fucking old 60s Twiggy song or something.  Did you say something?  Surf music.  Strawberry alarm clock.  I don't know, buddy.  To serve with love.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know what the hell they went into. 
[00:13:00]  But it was so funny.  He goes, oh, that was a rough one.  So it was a huge night for XM.  You guys had a viewing party.  Anyone get drunk?  Any good stories behind the scenes?  You know, not any good drunk stories here.  I think everybody was just too exhausted.  It was so late.  Yeah.  But, no, it was good.  It was fun.  It was really weird to sit down and watch the show with everybody.  You did have a lot of makeup on, Elo.  I did have.  They did cake it on quite a bit.  They over-rouged your cheeks. 
[00:13:30]  You looked jolly.  And you had mascara on.  I had a little line stuff in my creases of my eyes and all that stuff.  Yeah, and then a lot of just, like, base on your face.  Now it all makes sense because we remember you coming by the studios here in New York  with the brand new haircut.  We're like, all right, what's up?  What's going on?  That was back in May.  What happened to the bowl cut?  All of a sudden, he's got this fancy haircut.  And what, the place was half built or something?  I said they, like, threw a couch in front of a wall that had a hole in it because, like,  they're still pulling wires. 
[00:14:00]  No, that was our jazz at Lincoln, those were the studios at Jazz at Lincoln Center.  You guys have seen them now.  They're finished.  They don't look anything like that.  Yeah, they weren't even done yet.  No, they weren't.  You see the sheetrock was up.  How about our boy Gary Hahn with all the logos in the shots?  Yeah, I noticed that, like, every shot had some type of XM, like a little glass statuette.  There were mic flags.  There were just signs.  Every door had XM on it.  Yeah, it was actually getting, the first, it was actually getting a little bit embarrassing 
[00:14:30]  because it was like, there was so much.  It was like, Gary, ease up on the logos.  Every shot.  But one of my favorite parts of last night's show is when they were actually going through  the songs, and Donald Trump was rocking in his limo with a mi-fi, with his head bopping,  barely.  You could barely notice, but his head was a-bopping to the music.  It was awful.  That reaction shot. 
[00:15:00]  He wasn't listening to those songs.  No, it's just like, Donald, bop your head up and down.  We're going to show the mi-fi, then we're going to get a reaction shot from you.  Yeah.  He didn't hear those songs.  Give us that just bit into a lemon face and bop your head up and down.  Let's take some phone calls.  It's Les in Ohio.  Les?  Les, come on.  Yeah.  We got a good energy going.  Let's go.  Yeah.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Oh, boy.  When did Ron Jeremy come to work for XM? 
[00:15:30]  A lot of people were commenting that Lee Abrams looked like Ron Jeremy.  I guess he's heard that a couple of times.  Yeah, maybe.  He has.  Let's see if Eric in Jersey has something.  Eric?  Hey, when is Lee Abrams going to start touring with Grateful Dead again?  Yeah, Lee was a big hit.  That's why I took him on the show.  He was a huge hit last night.  Everybody was on the message board there last night during the program. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, they do that on Whackbag.  Yeah, they had like a little viewing thread going, so you watch the show and comment on it,  and there were some pretty funny comments coming in about Lee and you.  Some guy was just doing screen captures the entire show of you and Lee talking to each other,  and I'm sure they'll be photoshopped later on in the day.  Oh, boy.  Of course.  Oh, boy.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, you were great, man, last night.  But, dude, if you had another haircut, I don't fucking say how much younger you can look. 
[00:16:30]  Dude, you look fucking young.  Yeah.  Well, I am young.  I mean, that's the thing.  Everybody thinks I'm 50.  I know.  I mean, like, eight years old young.  Eight years old in your dad's suit or something.  I do realize we have, like, a Doogie Howser running XM, right?  Yeah.  And with the rosy red cheeks.  Elo started on radio when he was eight.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Child prodigy.  He's a child prodigy in this business.  Mike?  Miss Fez.  So I want to let you guys know.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Thanks. 
[00:17:00]  Bye.  Fez, he's doing just fine.  Ryan Fez on right after us.  Brian in Ohio.  Brian.  Yeah.  I've been reading some of the SEC statements.  Who is Eric Logan Toppenberg?  And why'd you drop the Toppenberg?  What's the deal with that?  Do you throw in a K?  Maybe you say, what's up?  What's the real name of Eric Logan?  Well, it's just like Opie goes by Opie.  And there's another name for Opie, as we all know.  Actually, Eric Logan is what I went by.  But Toppenberg is actually my real last name.  Yeah.  That's not a good radio last name. 
[00:17:30]  It's not a good radio last name, right?  Logan's a great radio last name.  Logan!  Logan.  Eric Logan.  They're not going to like Toppenberg and the Red States.  No.  The Red States wouldn't like that at all.  You look like you should have been sitting next to like a ventriloquist with that much rouge  on you.  You look like a mannequin.  Right back down to earth after your big party and celebration last night, Elo.  It comes crashing down.  Yeah.  I love the part on the show where they had the music playing from the brand new musicians 
[00:18:00]  and they were taking phone calls while it was playing on XM Cafe because I was just waiting  for Ramon.  They took some listener calls to critique the music.  That's why we couldn't be in on this thing.  No.  Of course not.  They didn't know anything about this until like two weeks ago.  Of course not.  They didn't want our pets getting involved with their big day on NBC.  And you guys made the decision to pick the artist that was more, I don't know, conducive  to XM Cafe. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And I got to tell you, actually, I was like really dreading the decision and I was, Lee  and Lisa, I talked about it because it's totally subjective.  I mean, some people could agree that it was right or wrong based upon the music, but I  got to tell you that when they screwed up the channel lineup, that was, that to me was  like, you know, you made a presentation, you have the wrong channel lineup.  It's like going to a Pepsi presentation and having Sprite on there or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I noticed you're a little put off by that.  And wasn't that poster itself really cheesy looking? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It was horrible.  It was like some kid's Photoshop project.  It was horrible, by the way.  Yeah.  So your decision was pretty easy.  Yeah, it was.  And I tell you, I mean, here, here's something that nobody knows this story yet, but I'll  tell you guys, when we were done shooting what they call resolution, where we actually  told what team won, we went out in the hall of that room.  And when we went out in the hall of that room, they had the losing team, which had Randall  and Rebecca and Clay on it.  They had come out and the other team had already gone because they went to the helicopter to 
[00:19:30]  go right around Donald.  So they came out and Rebecca's hobbling, you know, on her crutches and she goes, oh, nice  to meet you.  And then Clay's like, see you later.  And Randall looked at me and if looks could kill, I'd be dead.  He wanted like, I want to rip your head off.  Really?  He just called me.  Because what they didn't, you know, we called them out into the resolution.  And actually in the room, they didn't edit it, they cut it out.  But Donald actually asked who was responsible for marketing.  And Randall goes, I was, sir.  He didn't see that part in resolution. 
[00:20:00]  You obviously see it in the boardroom.  But, you know, he was just like, you know, I want to kill you.  And it was, I remember looking at Lee going, oh, so I had to like go out the back door.  So.  You just called him out on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys want to play some audio from the show real fast?  Of course.  You got time, Elo?  Sure, buddy.  All right.  Here we go.  Today, I want you to develop new talent in another very sexy industry, the radio industry.  XM Satellite Radio has a value of $9.5 billion, has 150 channels and millions of subscribers. 
[00:20:30]  With so many stations, XM is constantly on the lookout for new musical talent to boost its brand.  For your next task, you will audition a variety of unsigned singers and then choose the artist you feel has the most talent.  Then, you will write an original song and supervise all creative aspects of producing a record.  Your song will play live on air for millions of listeners on one of XM Radio's premier stations, XM Cafe. 
[00:21:00]  You'll have access to professional musicians and producers to help you.  The team whose song best fits the format of XM Cafe, as judged by the XM Satellite Radio executives, wins.  What a great commercial right there.  Isn't that great?  Holy crap.  Yeah, that's a commercial.  Great commercial.  But the concept itself, to have junior executives writing songs, that was a little odd to me. 
[00:21:30]  As I watched them, I'm going, that's like having a band trying to do marketing.  Very difficult.  Yeah, it was, I think the whole point where they were trying to find talent, that's why they started with, you know, with the model, at the Trump Model Agency.  And they're like, you know, we've got to have somebody who knows how to find talent.  And it really was, you know, all these tasks come down to really execution and presentation.  That's really what they come down to.  And at the end of the day, the sales tasks are like that. 
[00:22:00]  But when they call, they call these subjective tasks.  When they have a subjective task, it comes down to how they present to the executive team and really how they execute the task.  And obviously, I think, you know, the team who won executed and presented much better.  Yeah, the other guy didn't seem to fit the format.  No, I mean, they didn't show you before they actually went on the air.  They actually performed for us in the room before they actually put them on the radio.  But they took that part out.  And when Levi came in before Jaday, Levi came in, and they had a keyboard set up in that small room with about a 400-watt speaker. 
[00:22:30]  And it was like right next to Lisa.  And it was about the size of a small car.  And he was playing this small little keyboard.  And all you could hear was the keyboard.  I remember looking at Lisa going, the guy can play piano, but I can't hear a word he's saying.  And it was just annoying loud.  And Carolyn was just like shaking her head and rolling her eyes the entire time.  I'm like, this is not good for this guy.  Yeah.  I like the big presentation. 
[00:23:00]  They wanted to have the other guy.  What was his name?  Jaday.  Jaday.  Oh, did they walk in with a grand entrance?  Yeah, they wanted this big grand entrance.  And the chick there on the crutches wanted to do this big grand entrance for him.  Kind of talk him up, hype him up, and then just have him in the room.  So now you know everything about him.  And he makes his grand entrance.  And the other guy on the team, Clay, just screwed it up completely.  In the middle of her talking and giving him the big talk up, he opens the door and lets 
[00:23:30]  him in the room.  So now she's like, that Clay has some issues.  Oh, boy.  We get to talk to him later on in the show.  Oh, we do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Because now I've seen the show, and I could rip him apart.  All right.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Bruce the Trucker.  Bruce?  How you doing, boy?  All right, man.  Bruce?  Hey, Elo, you brought back some memories of when I was younger watching Babes in Toyland  with all that rouge on it.  I thought Rebecca was hot. 
[00:24:00]  She was cute.  Actually, I got money on either her or Randall to win, by the way.  I really do.  Randall the black guy, right?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I thought, but I'll tell you, funny.  I mean, I obviously knew what team lost, and I've known for a while, and if you remember  the early part of the season, his grandmother died.  Right.  And they let him go to the funeral.  I looked at my wife, and I go, oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, I just killed the guy whose grandmother died.  They keep shooting.  I was feeling a little bit guilty, but I'm glad he didn't get fired, because I really think  Randall is the best one on the show.  I really do.  Him and Rebecca are both really good.  He's a Rhodes Scholar, too.  He's very smart.  I mean, you didn't see him present a lot, but I mean, in the meeting that they didn't  show, which was actually like the pre-meeting, kind of the meet the executives, he asked  amazing questions.  I mean, that guy is really, really smart.  Right.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Rich on Long Island.  Rich?  Yo, what's going on over there? 
[00:25:00]  How are you, Rich, man?  All right, Dr. Ed.  Listen, I think you guys keep comparing the executives trying to pick a band like musicians  trying to do a presentation in front of a board meeting.  I think what they were trying to do this time was trying to figure out who had the  most creativity on the team, because a lot of times these hard-ass, stupid guys go to  college, they have no creativity on their own.  That's a good point.  So I thought these guys were trying to find the creative aspect on these people, because  a lot of times they're bringing different aspects of the presentation.  Yeah, see if they have any creativity. 
[00:25:30]  Hilo, do these groups have help writing the song from someone?  Yeah, they actually were provided a songwriter, which you didn't see, and obviously a big  producer or session musicians.  So they came up with a basic song, and then the songwriters took over, basically?  Yeah, basically.  They kind of said, well, what do you want to say?  What's your message?  And you saw some of that.  And the songwriters kind of helped them hone it in to whatever they wanted.  Yeah, because even though the songs were kind of hokey in general, they had something to  them.  So I'm like, all right, they're getting help from Sony or somebody. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, and I can't remember the producers in some of this.  I mean, I'll tell you, the guy that played drums on, I think it was Jaday's track, actually  was like Sting's drummer, you know, and he was great.  Yeah.  So, I mean, they were real big-time musicians.  All right.  We got another clip from The Apprentice last night.  We meet Hilo in this clip.  Oh, great.  Good to see you.  Great to see you.  Great to see you.  This is Levi.  Levi?  Levi?  Pleasure to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  Hi, Levi.  Pleasure to meet you.  I'm Lee.  No, Levi.  Lee?  No. 
[00:26:30]  Eric Logan, Executive Vice President for XM Satellite Radio.  How awkward is that?  Executive Vice President.  Executive Vice President of XM Satellite Radio.  Very embarrassing to introduce yourself.  I hate it when you do that in meetings.  Go around the table, introduce yourself.  It's like, ugh.  Executive Vice President.  Executive Vice President.  He said that a few times in the past.  Yeah, he got that out without a glitch.  No problem.  Kevin in Boston, what's up?  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Good.  Yeah, I just, every time I saw Hilo, I pictured if you threw a little diaper and some wings on 
[00:27:00]  him, he'd look like a little Cupid doll, those cherub angels.  Cherub angel?  I can't wait for the photoshops on Wackbag.  Oh, yeah.  They've been working very hard over there.  All night long, right?  Let's say hi to John on Long Island.  Hey, John.  What do you say, fellas?  What's up?  Yo, Lee Abrams looks like Captain Insano from Billy Madison.  Captain Insano?  Punch it out.  All right, very good.  All right, more audio here. 
[00:27:30]  This was the big moment for Hilo on the show last night.  Hilo passes judgment on the teams.  So the two teams were working with these new R's.  They came up with the song.  And then, I guess the songs were played on Lou Brutus' show there.  He did XM Cafe for the day or something.  Yep.  And then, now Hilo has to decide who wins, right?  Right.  Here it is.  They both made great records.  They both made great records.  Yeah.  I mean, I like them both.  I just think one song was better for XM Cafe than the other.  Hello, folks. 
[00:28:00]  Welcome to XM, Donald.  Let me ask you, how did the teams do?  What did you think?  Welcome to XM, Donald.  What are you supposed to say?  I don't know.  Were you nervous?  Be honest.  Oh, dude.  Yeah, I got to tell you.  You don't meet him before that.  They don't want you to see him or talk to him before he walks into the room.  They want it to be totally natural.  And I said to the producer, I go, well, what do I say when he walks in?  He goes, well, just welcome him to XM.  And I'm like, well, that's a good idea, so I'll do that.  Yeah, he's one of these guys that is bigger than life, too. 
[00:28:30]  So when he comes into the room, you're seeing him for the first time.  You've got to be just a little freaked out inside.  Yeah, I was.  You can hear it in his voice, because we know Hilo pretty well.  Hello, folks.  Welcome to XM, Donald.  Let me ask you, how did the teams do?  What did you think?  I think they did well.  I think they've produced two really good records.  And I think that, you know, there is a clear winner between the two.  Oh, really?  Yes, there is.  We're really excited.  We'd love to bring the teams in and let you know our thoughts.  I'd love you to do that.  Thank you.  Great.  Bring him in.  Very dramatic. 
[00:29:00]  What's going to happen?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Go ahead.  I'd love to hear this.  Capital Edge.  I really felt that when you listened to this record, I knew who Levi was.  I felt that it fit Cafe very, very well as well.  Excel, we thought that the presentation, you had a great story to tell, and we were looking  forward to hearing it.  And we really weren't quite getting that story from the artist into that song.  There was a little bit of a disconnect from a couple of the callers that called in that  didn't understand why a record that was produced that way was actually on a cafe. 
[00:29:30]  Who won?  The risk that the Excel Corporation took was a big risk by creating a record that may not  have been consistent with the musical format of XM Cafe.  And they printed the wrong channel number in front of our entire executive team.  On the other hand, Capital Edge created a great record.  The smartest move that they made was making a record that fit XM Cafe.  Clearly, Capital Edge is the winner.  There you go.  Man, you know how to speak. 
[00:30:00]  Elo knows how to talk, man.  Almost, Elo, almost sounded written down and scripted, one little part of that.  Will truth be known?  Yes.  Actually, that was all just kind of right hand.  There was no scripting of that.  The part where I had to actually tell the team who lost, I had to overdub that about five  different times.  Yeah, I was hearing the sound was a little different.  It didn't sound like the same room.  They couldn't get the timbre right to match it because they have so many mics in there 
[00:30:30]  and they actually stick a mic actually in your tie.  It's a tie that's actually inside of your tie knot.  And if the words get chomped up or something, they send you back in a studio to recut the line.  Recut the line.  And you could kind of tell.  Looping.  Looping.  Yeah.  That's what it's called in the industry.  Right.  Absolutely.  Eric Rabinowitz.  That's also, that's a term for caddying too.  The looper.  Pro-jive.  All right.  Let's go to the phones here.  Let's say hi to Johnny in Queens.  Johnny.  Johnny.  Good morning, gentlemen. 
[00:31:00]  Good morning, Johnny.  Jenny.  Opie, Anthony.  Knock off Jimmy.  Elo.  Canal screen.  Jimmy.  If I lifted your arm over your head, could I snap a walnut in your mouth?  Oh, I see what he's saying.  One of those, um, one of those Christmas soldier nutcrackers.  Boy, the Red Rouge thing has really taken off.  John and Glendale.  The Red, Red, whatever.  John.  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[00:31:30]  Hey, we're on with Elo here.  Yeah, when I was switching through the channels, I thought I was watching The End of Bacon.  But I saw Elo.  Punch it out.  You're getting killed, man.  Oh, I knew it was coming.  You're getting killed.  The End of Bacon.  All right.  Just to wrap up this whole thing.  So then they have to go in the boardroom, the losing team, and Clay gets fired.  We're going to have Clay on the show a little later on this morning, but here's some audio.  Clay, Rebecca told me she couldn't work with you again. 
[00:32:00]  Other teammates of yours told me they couldn't work with you again.  Allah said it.  Adam said it.  They were so happy when you left that team.  You're supposed to be creative.  But no matter which team you're on, all you do is create problems.  Clay, you're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Elo, you're fired.  Yep.  Elo, are you going to be working for Donald Trump in the near future? 
[00:32:30]  I don't know.  I mean, you never know.  I mean, he's a nice guy.  He's a smart man.  You're going to jump ship, aren't you?  I love XM.  I don't see me jumping ship anytime soon.  Did he make any offers?  He just has the perfect answer, no matter what you ask him.  It's always positive.  It doesn't politically fuck him at all.  No.  We've hit this guy with some really tough questions, and he has an answer for everything.  He's very good at it.  Did you take a little ride?  He always leaves all avenues still open.  What do you think of child molesters?  Well, you know, it's an interesting topic.  I need to do a little more research before I make an answer. 
[00:33:00]  Before I have an opinion.  Any ride in the chopper there, Elo?  No, I wish, though.  That would have been hot.  No ride in the chopper.  Geez, you'd think all the guys would have gotten a little ride in the chopper with the Trump.  What was the goal?  No, but I did write a nice big long letter to Carolyn and George and sent them radios.  And, you know, I was working the Carolins at the Trump golf course in Jersey.  And we, oh, yeah, by the way, we have a PGA Tour channel.  I'm trying to work my way on to the Trump International Golf Course.  Oh, that would be cool.  What was the coolest thing that happened during this whole experience? 
[00:33:30]  The coolest thing?  Probably Donald.  Team Donald.  Just meeting him?  Yeah, meeting Donald would be there.  That was it.  All right.  So then when Clay got fired, all these people get the opportunity to talk as they're taking  a cab ride back to wherever they live, I guess.  Rebecca and Randall don't have any creative bones in their body, and they don't have a  chance at all as a team.  They are going to lose the next task horribly, especially with Rebecca with a broken ankle.  I feel sorry for the three people on Capitol Edge that are left, especially for Adam and 
[00:34:00]  Felicia, because they're going to see a different side of life.  Because now that I'm gone, all of a sudden have anybody to pick on, and they're next.  And there you have it.  And Clay will be on the show later today.  Elo, this was much bigger than Letterman, right?  Yeah.  And I got to tell you, actually, the highlight of my night, even though this was fun, was  getting the call from you at dinner saying that the pests attacked Howard.  And I actually ran...  Pull the strings! 
[00:34:30]  Pull the strings!  Oh, my God.  I went online and looked at it from the studios here.  I was howling.  Yeah.  Yeah, Howard was on Letterman last night, and it was a complete bore fest.  He did not sell this industry at all.  Thanks for the help, Howard.  You did nothing for satellite radio.  And you know something?  I mean, you guys know this, but I'm telling you, that unnerved him.  I mean, he may have gone in there, and the pests may have completely taken him out of his  game.  He may have just completely melted down, because you know how he gets about you guys. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, and just to have that many pests with that many signs, there were huge, full-color  XM banners.  I mean, where three, four people had to hold these things up.  There were our regular signs that are just huge by themselves, that one guy can hold up  over the head, the same ones you see on the assaults on the media.  ONA wow stickers, just plenty of signs.  And then you could see two or three people in the shot with these printed out, like some  guy printed them at home, eight by ten pieces of paper, black and white Xerox, yeah, Howard 
[00:35:30]  Stern things.  And it looked like it was an XM event that a couple of serious people came to.  Of course.  And the pest did a great, great job, man.  I got a lot of reports on this one.  Boyd Gary was on the lookout for our pest.  That was his job yesterday, as Letterman was going...  Oh, good job.  Look at that picture I'm looking at.  Oh, no, I'll explain, though.  As Howard was going to Letterman to do his thing last night, right? 
[00:36:00]  So Boyd Gary's job was to, you know, report back to Howard, because, you know, he's just  a douche, and give Howard a full report if there's any Opie and Anthony action outside  the Letterman's studio, right?  The pests are too smart for this shit.  Yeah.  So the pests get in with the Howard fans, and there weren't that many.  In the old days, there used to be thousands wherever Howard went.  There was maybe a couple dozen, right?  But our pests were within them.  Yeah.  Standing next to them, right?  With no clue that they were with our show. 
[00:36:30]  As soon as Howard arrived, then all of a sudden, like the Secret Service, they pull out banners  and all sorts of stuff right in front of Howard's face.  It came out of nowhere.  Yeah.  Because we got pictures on opieandanthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  You see the whole thing, because Eric was down there.  Eric was like two feet from Howard, and Howard has no clue.  One of our guys was literally two to three feet away from Howard.  And all the pictures you're seeing online are from Eric's camera.  Oh, it threw them.  So Eric documented this whole thing.  He shows the crowd where it looks like just a normal crowd, nothing's going on, and then 
[00:37:00]  BAM!  Everyone pulls out their banners and stuff that they were hiding the whole time.  And you know how he is.  I mean, how many times have there been, like, a public event that you guys have been there  that he sits out front and refuses to go in until you guys leave?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  Many times.  Yeah, and that's the same.  Did you see, you know the story about Radio Man now, right?  Are you guys hip to this?  No.  You know who Radio Man is right in Manhattan, right?  Yeah, of course.  Well, Radio Man last week got an upgrade. 
[00:37:30]  Radio Man is now Satellite Radio Man, and he used to wear that radio around his neck.  Now he wears a MiFi around his neck.  And we've got photos of Radio Man, and he's got XM on his bicycle now, and he goes to  all these events as XM Radio Man.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got a picture of him up there.  Hopefully we're paying him, because he needs a few bucks, that guy.  This guy's a fixture of New York City.  I guess Robin Williams played him in that movie, right?  Yeah, he did.  Absolutely.  What the hell was the name of that movie again?  Mrs. Doubtfire? 
[00:38:00]  No.  Help me out for once.  Yes?  Yes, Kevin?  Patch Adams.  The Fisher King?  Oh, thank you.  Yes, The Fisher King.  The Fisher King.  Yeah, he's legendary.  It's a chess movie.  No.  That's searching for Bobby Fisher.  So I do believe we trumped the Little Doggy Company last night.  Oh, boy.  Look at what I'm reading on Instant Feedback.  I hear that the jerk from the Phillips file says that that wasn't the real Eric Logan on 
[00:38:30]  The Apprentice last night.  You've got to love the little callbacks from the listeners.  Oh, okay.  Big-ass member wants in.  Big-ass member.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  We had a great, successful assault.  Got to give props to every single one of those pets who kept it top secret.  Yeah.  Not posting it anywhere on any message board.  Yeah, Elo, this whole thing has gone underground deep.  Like, this wasn't posted anywhere, but they had this whole thing planned weeks ago. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, when you called me, I was dumbfounded because I hadn't heard nothing about it.  Oh, we didn't say a word.  We knew it was going down.  You know, they got a whole underground thing that's going on.  Network, yeah.  And wherever he goes, we'll be there, just making his life a living hell.  And you know what's funny?  It was funny.  Remember the bus tour and all the tours and everything?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing else about it.  You know why?  You know why you're not going to hear anything else about it?  Because of what happened yesterday.  He doesn't want to deal with us.  He absolutely doesn't want to deal with us.  And this underground army is getting even bigger. 
[00:39:30]  Even bigger.  And, you know, there really isn't this.  Everyone thought there'd be this huge push for him by Sirius, and it's just not happening.  There was more of a push when they kind of announced that he was signing, where they  would take him out with the bus and, you know, big gatherings and stuff.  And now it's just, all right, get in there, do your job.  There were 36 of us and possibly 40 of them.  There was 36 Opie and Anthony fans there.  Wow.  They even know the exact number of people that they had for this mission. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, and a couple of dozen of their guys.  So what did he do when he got everybody, we started pulling out the signs that he...  Well, there's some great audio we'll try to get to.  He was really distracted.  You could tell he was very distracted, and then he just went inside.  And he's a complete phony because CBS in New York was interviewing him, and you could  hear clear as day, Opie and Anthony just being screened, right?  And he turns and goes, look, my fans want me.  My public, yeah, wants me.  Or my public awaits.  It's like, no, you ass.  Man, Elo getting rave reviews, though. 
[00:40:30]  Look at this one.  If Elo and a puggle were in the same room, a little girl would not know which one to  run to.  They love you, Elo.  I'm glad to see him on the same level as a puggle.  That's a puggle, cute as a button.  It was just a huge, huge night for XM on The Apprentice.  And we trumped Letterman big time.  Definitely.  Definitely, definitely, definitely. 
[00:41:00]  A few more calls coming in here.  Let's say hi to Scott in Iowa.  Scott?  Yeah, I got two questions for Elo.  I just wanted to know what he thought of getting half of Terrific out yesterday when he got  hung up on.  Oh, jeez.  You're not supposed to bring those up.  And the other thing was, I didn't get in the other day.  I just wanted to know if he thought that any chance that we might be able to keep the  NASCAR channel.  I didn't get in the other day.  The phones were tied up.  Yeah.  No, actually, there's not.  I mean, it's going away in 07.  And the bottom line is, we know what that property's worth. 
[00:41:30]  And it's a great property.  And we knew what we felt that it was going to value the company.  And so that's why we felt good about the decision of not having them.  So we wish we could have it.  It's a great sport.  And we wish Tony Stewart all the luck on Sunday.  We'll have it next year.  But at the end of the day, it's going to move on.  But we feel great.  We'll have over 5,100 live sporting events.  See what I'm saying?  Just perfect answer.  Look how diplomatic that was.  I'd be like, fuck them.  I hope they all crash and burn now.  That's right. 
[00:42:00]  He just actually made me feel good as he's talking about.  He was basically saying, fuck the NASCAR channel.  We're not doing it.  And it was.  Yeah.  How do you learn how to talk like that?  I don't know.  I hope there's 27 pit fires in the next race.  If someone asked me a question like that, I'd have flop sweat.  I'm trying to get an invisible flame where you burn for 20 seconds before anybody realizes  you're on fire.  The crew's rolling around.  You don't know why.  That's what I want to say.  But no, we're very happy with people.  We wish them the best of luck. 
[00:42:30]  All right, Eric.  We're not hanging up on you today.  Relax.  Very good job.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  We'll talk to you later.  Bye.  All right.  There you go, sir.  My wife.  Look how you bailed out.  Yeah.  Look how you bailed out.  We're not hanging up on you.  Okay, very good.  Bye-bye-bye.  He still thought we were going to hang up.  My wife's president of Programming, XM SoundCloud Radio.  He is good, man.  Eric Logan.  My wife decided to explore options outside of the perimeter of our relationship.  A holy matrimony.  And, you know, we're in a good... 
[00:43:00]  Are we happy about that?  No, but we're accepting and we're moving on.  Life is a learning experience, I believe.  We're in a good place.  And we look forward to a new day.  That's Elo.  Underline tone, you fucking whore.  That's how you get to be the vice president of programming for XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  Yeah, but there's not a twinge of phony.  It's like he believes it.  Of course.  Of course he does.  He absolutely believes what he says. 
[00:43:30]  Which is why his cheeks stay so rosy.  So rosy red.  And the slathering of rouge that was on his cheeks.  Fucking kabuki girl.  Yeah, kabuki, the nutcracker, a cherub.  We'll take our first break.  We got no filter Paul on hold.  He was part of that assault last night.  We'll get some inside details.  How fat did Robin get?  Did you see the pictures?  I'm not even doing it like, hey, she's fat.  She's fat.  But man, she was always kind of a big woman. 
[00:44:00]  And then she lost weight at some point.  But the pictures last night, oof.  Oof.  Did she get fat?  Maybe she's just...  She is exploring her options.  Her caloric options are being explored.  We're happy about that.  Those are going up.  Very happy for her.  That there is actually more of her now.  Would we have liked her to not eat all the Danish?  Yes.  Wow, she's a fat pig.  This could be an economic boon to the Danish industry. 
[00:44:30]  Maybe she's in a fat suit.  You think she's doing the fat suit expose?  I think she's doing the fat suit thing.  People treated me horribly, Howard.  Shut up, whore.  There's something going on in her head that she's got to eat a lot of food.  She's covering something up.  It is.  Eating a little too much comfort food there, Robin.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  A little worried?  Starting to realize that you really aren't worth shit in this business?  Eat a little piece of cake when you feel a little nervous about the move? 
[00:45:00]  About the big move?  Wow.  That is a big woman.  Yeah, that's a big, big woman.  God damn.  She looks like she should be being brought out by a Blackhawk helicopter in a harness.  Isn't she?  She's hiding a world of hurt with food.  Come on.  That was a good fucking hurricane joke.  Someone got it out there.  Relax.  Of course they did.  I just like Bill.  They got nothing.  They got smiles.  All right, let's...  That's not my fight. 
[00:45:30]  Katrina?  Let's take our first break.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program in just a bit, but some great pictures on opieandanthony.com  and foundrymusic.com as we made Howard look like a complete ass once again last night.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe bang me up the ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the T.F. thing. 
[00:46:30]  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite world treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  That's all right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak. 
[00:47:00]  That's what they call me.  Oh, God.  After I suck you off, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard male cock.  Yes.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock.  From Ben the other day.  Oh, I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy. 
[00:47:30]  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  And Anthony Shaw. 
[00:48:00]  On the bell door.  Got my disheart.  On the bell door.  What happened?  Why are you pointing at your headphones?  What did I do wrong?  There we go.  Everything in here smells like Lysol, by the way.  Yeah, it's all Lysoled out.  Which is reminding me of the horror. 
[00:48:30]  Of yesterday?  Of yesterday.  That was so nasty.  We did a lot of great radio this week.  That's the one thing they'll remember, though.  I listened to it on the replay.  And I was completely disgusted.  Like, the smell actually came back.  It was stored in my brain.  And then, as I heard it, the smell came back.  And I actually had a vivid memory of the smell of her ass.  Was that the worst smell you have smelt?  Not in here, no.  In this studio?  You know something?  No.  Not the worst.  Really?  The worst smell in here came off of Tippy Tom. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  The other homeless guy.  Oh, yeah.  Her ass was bad.  It was...  But, you know, in reality, it was ass.  You know, you've smelt it before.  It's just rancid ass.  Uh, no.  No.  You know what, Anthony?  You've never been on a fucking train or a bus and had some fucking...  Homeless person take their clothes off and open their ass up on the bus that you could  visually see?  No.  No.  No, I'm not saying the intensity of it was...  It had a whiff of an ass, but this had a smell that was... 
[00:49:30]  Let me tell you something.  The intensity of it was staggering.  Yes.  Literally staggering.  Of course.  But it was a smell that you had smelt before.  It's rank ass.  It's cranky ass.  No.  Yeah.  It would have said I had a dog come in and smell it.  I swear to God, it would have...  Yeah.  I've done that little dog sneeze.  You could tell the smell was in the ass category, but...  Yeah.  I'm just saying it had its own thing going on, man.  When Tippy Tom comes in here, it's everything like it's a soup. 
[00:50:00]  It's a stew of those smells.  Ass, armpit, crotch, feet, lice head.  Gangrene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some diseases.  It's breath, gum problem, gingivitis, pyorrhea.  Put it this way.  It's been a while since I've left this studio wondering, like, what happened?  To my entertainment career.  Yeah.  Yesterday was one of those days.  Was this the track that I initially wanted to go down? 
[00:50:30]  Didn't I used to fantasize of accepting an Oscar for best lead redhead in a fucking movie?  And how did I end up...  How am I here?  ...end up reacting to this smell?  Now, why am I a German porn star in this moment?  Yeah.  Why am I in this moment?  Fast forward, you're a German porn star.  I literally did.  I was trying to put it together.  Okay.  I got on the Chappelle Show.  Things were going good.  Yeah.  Went on a tour, came in here, sat in.  Isn't this just like being on the Chappelle Show?  And then what happened?  Did it okay?  Yeah.  What happened? 
[00:51:00]  What happened to Bill Burr?  Well, Chappelle Show was...  We made up stuff.  There was people pretending to be homeless.  Right, right.  It wasn't real homeless people.  Yes.  That's the beauty of this show.  It was a great bit yesterday.  It was awesome.  There was no beauty.  And a lot of people thought it was you smelling the ass because we had two Bills going on.  Yeah.  Bill Burr, obviously, filling in for Jim Norton.  And then we have Crazy Bill, our intern that just does crazy shit.  We love when he smells stuff.  Matter of fact, we're starting a new bit.  We're not sure how it's going to work, but make Bill puke.  Because we're...  You got to have make intern Bill puke.  Make intern Bill puke because... 
[00:51:30]  People think it was me yesterday.  Like, dude, you took one for the team.  I can't take credit for that.  Because it's been disappointing.  You know, Crazy Bill has smelled Big A's breath, who's here today, by the way.  Stalker Patty's armpits.  And now the hooker's ass.  And we get a reaction, but not the reaction we're hoping for, considering the smell.  That we smelled like 10, 15 feet away.  So now we're obsessed with making Bill puke.  Yes.  We got to make that happen.  He's more of a joke writer.  But basically, yeah, the hooker was just completely naked, on her belly, spread her cheeks, and 
[00:52:00]  intern Bill, Crazy Bill, was what?  An inch away?  Because it wasn't good enough when he was about a foot away.  Yeah, he tried inches away.  He tried one foot away.  And we're like, no, unacceptable.  It was like he was testing a glass of wine.  Right.  Yeah.  You got to get your nose right in there.  And there are people right now that have not heard the show yet.  This is the first day.  Look what you missed yesterday. 
[00:52:30]  It was unbelievable.  It's horrific.  But anyway, you guys are right.  The whole place smells like Lysol because of that.  That's all right, though.  Not really, man.  This microphone.  No, Lysol reminds me of the smell it was trying to overpower.  You've ruined that product for me.  We're going to have to get some other air freshener.  All right.  We got lots of show to do today.  Let's say hi to No Filter Paul.  No Filter Paul, by the way, in the lead for the Assault on the Media Contest for November.  And half the month is already over. 
[00:53:00]  What's up, Paul?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right.  Did you guys saw all that craziness yesterday?  Yeah, you guys, I got to tell you, I was watching CBS News at, I think it was 5 o'clock.  Right.  Here in New York.  I knew the Assault was coming.  You had, what, like 20 guys attack the reporter?  Yeah, it was about 25, actually.  They cut us off pretty quickly.  They cut away from that scene really quick.  And you guys accomplished your job because you threw them off their game and they never  came back to do the live shot, to do the wrap-up. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, the woman actually said to us, you guys can leave now.  They've told us they're not coming back to us and they just put the camera in the truck.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You guys know you just missed, right?  Oh, yeah.  They just missed.  They cut us off pretty quick.  You missed.  This reporter was doing a story outside the Letterman studio last night and these guys  came running from all directions.  All directions, screaming and yelling, Opie and Anthony.  Were you that far away that you couldn't get in the shot sooner?  Yeah, pretty much.  We had to hide because we were all in alcoves. 
[00:54:00]  There was like three or four sections.  Three or four.  Yeah, sorry.  All right, two or four.  So, yeah, we were just hidden all over the place and we got the word on the live shot  and we just ran from all different directions.  And did you see High Pitch Idiot there?  In the background, he was waving and we just came in and crushed his spot completely.  High Pitch Eric, who's been trying to become part of this show for many, many years?  Yes.  Yes, I did see him.  Here's the audio.  Like I said, you guys just missed.  The video's pretty funny, though.  It's up on the websites.  Well, Howard Stern just left the building here after taping the Late Show with David Letterman 
[00:54:30]  that will air tonight.  But, of course, before he went inside, he took some time to talk to CBS, too.  You could tell they were coming, you know what I mean?  And they got really close.  If she went on for one more second, it would have been some unbelievable TV.  Yeah, that was it.  I was at home like, oh, just missed.  Huge stampede behind her.  It was a huge stampede.  All these pests coming from all directions as she's trying to do her stupid job.  It still made me laugh really hard because they had banners and bumper stickers. 
[00:55:00]  And, like I said, they were coming from all directions getting louder and louder as they  were getting closer.  So, way to go, Paul.  Did you see that they edited out the crowd of pests in the actual videotape report?  But you managed to see my fat ass jumping up and down in the background.  Oh, really?  At one point, yeah.  Well, you guys did a great job because you guys were yelling Opie and Anthony and Coward  Stern and all that as he's, like, pointing to his, quote, fans going, look, my fans.  Yeah, all you hear is Opie and Anthony, you suck.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:55:30]  You've got to give Bam credit.  He was the one who organized the whole thing.  You guys were unbelievable, man.  Very covert, very underground.  I love this.  There's many, many stages of the ONA Army.  They have special ops now.  They've got special ops.  Oh, look, look.  Some people are upset.  Why?  When exactly are you on 60 Minutes, Anthony?  What did I say?  Oh, I forgot.  You're not ever going to be there like Howard.  Yeah.  I'm never going to be on 60 Minutes. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, we've never done national TV.  Oh, that's a shame, though.  You know something?  The guy's right.  It's big news that he's going over to satellite radio and he gets 60 Minutes.  Hey, buddy, why don't you look at some of his television appearances from what is called  his heyday before he went over the hump and is now on the downward spiral of his career?  You'll see a lot more people at things like the Letterman appearances, book signings, just him being out in public. 
[00:56:30]  There were a couple of dozen people milling around the Letterman studios where years ago there would have been thousands.  They would have had to close off Broadway with police barricades years ago.  It just ain't happening anymore.  Yeah, he's still on 60 Minutes.  He's still on Letterman.  But it sure as shit isn't the Letterman appearances of old where it was actually fun and interesting to watch because it was like, wow, this is outrageous.  I wonder what he's going to do instead of a little infomercial for where he's going. 
[00:57:00]  So you're right.  Yeah, I won't be on 60 Minutes.  We've done national TV.  During the waning part of my career.  Lots of national TV.  That's fine, though.  60 Minutes is pretty big.  They had a piece on us, Super Bowl Sunday, let's not forget, last year.  Yeah.  Super Bowl Sunday, part of the pre-pre-pre-game show.  That's right, part of the 18 hours of Super Bowl programming.  We were technically part of the pre-game show of the Super Bowl last year.  In the Tri-State area.  That's all right.  No, it was a national piece, but it was like the pre-game show started like, I don't know, 7.30 in the morning and our piece aired like 9. 
[00:57:30]  Something like that.  It was exposure, though.  See the difference?  We don't take this shit seriously.  We're still having fun doing this.  We still really enjoy getting under someone's skin.  So, Paul, you guys were unbelievable, though.  You guys were just kind of hanging out in the crowd.  No one knew you were from the Opie and Anthony show.  And then all of a sudden you guys just attacked.  Right. 
[00:58:00]  They had no clue.  That was great.  They were pretty pissed off afterwards, the serious little pests.  Right.  All five of them with their little black and white photocopied signs.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Angry Black started a fight with a couple of our guys.  Oh, yeah.  And everyone's talking about that today.  Wow.  That was a...  Yeah, it took a swing at somebody.  That was a big deal.  Yeah, I think that was Mike, the guy that did the assault with me.  What an ass this guy is.  Does he actually think...  What is he on the...  He thinks he's on the payroll?  He thinks how he cares about what this guy does?  This guy is like throwing punches. 
[00:58:30]  Could be taking, you know, getting an assault charge against him.  Yeah, and they get fired from Verizon.  What a shame.  And he just...  Yeah, he works for Verizon.  He's one of these hangers-on guys.  And he's treating it like he's a member of the show.  Yeah.  Because he can maybe go to the bar on a Friday and go, hey, you know who I am?  Wow.  That's big.  I'm Angry Coon.  And...  Jesus.  There's another guy on Instant Feedback that just keeps printing 500 million, 500 million. 
[00:59:00]  Great.  Yeah, well, I'm glad, Wally, I'm glad you know the motivation behind why he's going to  Sirius.  Yeah, I think...  I'm glad you identified that.  500 million, not a bad payday.  How much of that is Angry Black actually getting?  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.  He gets maybe a few hundred dollars here and there.  I doubt that.  No, I don't think he's getting anything.  I doubt he gets dime one.  Yeah.  He's just one of these guys who there were many of years ago.  The fanatic fans, they used to be there at every event. 
[00:59:30]  They're just not...  Now you can name them.  You know, now you know them all by name.  Yeah, now fast forward to 2005.  It took 30 of our pets...  Yeah.  ...to make his Little Letterman appearance a nightmare.  Do you know what 30 people opposing Howard would have happened to back at his book signing?  We'd be at Huff.  Movie premiere.  You wouldn't have even noticed.  You wouldn't have noticed.  And yeah, they would have just been pummeled.  It just...  That isn't...  That isn't the way it is anymore. 
[01:00:00]  We have the passion.  They don't.  They're paying $500 million for something that is way past its prime.  Look at the pictures, though.  I'm going to say it again.  We have the passion still.  He and his fans don't.  The company he works for doesn't have the passion either.  They had tiny little print-up signs outside Letterman on like...  Yeah, good job.  It looked like they just copied it at the office.  It was paper.  It's what you put in a printer.  Look for yourself.  Go to opianthony.com.  We had full-color billboards and pull-out signs. 
[01:00:30]  That's the kind of support?  We made them look stupid.  Man, Howard, if that's the support that Sirius is giving you, there's going to be some problems.  You're going to have a little bit of trouble there.  And this is just the beginning.  Simple as this.  Wherever he goes, we'll be there.  How long before he starts claiming to invent assault on the media and starts saying that,  you know, hyper-geric are doing that?  That's fine.  I think people are on to that bullshit, finally.  Yeah.  All right, Paul.  Anything else to add? 
[01:01:00]  There was a couple of XM marketing people down there.  There was some old guy with a bicycle.  You guys know anything about that?  Oh, that's Radio Man.  Right.  We were talking about him.  Oh, okay.  Or Elo was.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's XM Radio Man now.  Yeah, he's XM Radio Man.  And that was better marketing than Sirius did that day.  Well, that guy goes to every single movie premiere and every single little thing that's a red carpet event that's going on in New York, he shows up to.  And now he's advertising XM.  Okay.  All right, Paul.  Great job.  Okay.  And tonight we're all going to the Red Rock West at 7 p.m. for Denise's birthday badge, if anyone gives a shit. 
[01:01:30]  Birthday.  That's your wife, right?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  As long as there are black guys there, she'll remain my wife.  I thought you would get her a black guy for her birthday.  Seems to like them.  Yeah.  Angry black.  I'm finding out what his fees are.  I'm going to give him a call.  All right, bro.  You're still in the lead for the Assault on the Media Contest for November.  Thank you, guys.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  There he goes.  No filter, Paul.  Just absolutely does a lot of great stuff for the show.  Mike in Queens, what's up?  Yeah, I was part of the Assault last night, too.  Paul missed a couple of things. 
[01:02:00]  Chester's Ashes mentioned that the Assault actually looked like, did you ever see the  end scene of Midnight Run when De Niro yells at the mic, Serrano's got the disc, Serrano's  got the disc.  And then everybody just came out of everywhere.  I got the WOW sticker in on the right side of the screen, so it made it in.  Yeah, it was great.  Like I said, if she went another second or two, it would have been just complete mayhem.  You guys were coming from all directions, and a lot of you, and you could hear it. 
[01:02:30]  And then she cut off really fast, and they never went back to her because they couldn't  go back there.  All right.  She wasn't happy.  Very good, Mike.  Thank you so much.  Mikey.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, all right?  Okay.  You going to talk about the fight now, or what?  The fight?  Yeah, there's a little skirmish afterwards.  Yeah, we talked about it, all right?  Yeah, we talked about it.  Okay.  We don't want to give that douchebag too much time.  He's a nobody.  Okay.  And we made him look stupid, too.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Let's go to Doug Out Doug. 
[01:03:00]  Doug, what's going on, man?  Hey, one of the parts that I found really amusing was I was monitoring the Stern Fan Network  message board while this was all going on.  Yeah.  And they were actually claiming an assault on the media for high-pitched Eric.  And even their fans called each other out saying, yeah, show what happened 20 seconds  after Eric's waving to the camera.  Right.  Exactly.  It was a little different.  20 ONA fans rushed to the screen.  Exactly.  Now, they did a great job, man.  Bam has got to be a new general here.  He did an awesome job setting this up. 
[01:03:30]  Well, that'll be up to you guys.  I mean, you've got special ops and all sorts of stuff.  Oh, yeah.  We're always working.  Navy SEALs.  There's other people.  There's a bunch of brand-new listeners that have no idea about the ONA Army and how a lot  of it's underground.  And they don't even have an idea that they're called pests.  Yeah, it was tough.  We had to keep bumping.  Because I got some intel from the inside about the media being there.  Yeah.  So we wanted to set this up and do it in a way that we couldn't use any of the message  boards because we didn't want these Stern Fan guys finding out about it. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Because we had a problem with Joey Boots all over the place.  So we just took it underground and did it via instant messages, phone conversation, and  PMs.  And, I mean, we got 30-something guys out of it this time.  So next time we want to up the numbers.  I hate to make the comparison, but they're kind of like Al-Qaeda now.  Al-Qaeda.  They're all over the place, but you can't really find them.  Jesus.  They're communicating.  We took it offline for a little bit to see how we could do that way. 
[01:04:30]  How can someone join the ONA Army?  Now it's one of those things where you've got to find one of us and you've got to know  somebody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're not fucking around.  Someone's got to vouch for you.  We had a couple covers blown because we had some guys sneaking on the inside of our plans.  Yeah.  So that won't happen again.  All right.  Good.  Yeah.  You live and learn, right, Doug?  Yes, sir.  Actually, you know, nothing but props to you guys today.  You guys were unbelievable last night. 
[01:05:00]  You made him look stupid.  Bravo.  You made him look foolish.  They did a great job editing that news piece, too, if you can check it out.  They took out a lot of the background noise.  As soon as Howard would stop talking, they would cut the background noise so you really  couldn't hear a lot of the chants.  You could only hear it while he was talking.  Right.  Well, it's okay.  We've got great pictures on opianthony.com.  Oh, he'll get his.  Boys, punch it out.  All right.  And he'll make believe it didn't happen, which just proves, you know, he's just scared  of us.  That's a fact.  We've known that for many, many years.  All right.  Enough of that, Ant. 
[01:05:30]  Enough.  Why don't we do some radio?  We've got a lot of stuff to do.  Dangerous toys.  The list of dangerous toys is out.  We've got Big A here.  We've got, I think...  What's Big A doing?  Well, we've got...  Muttering to himself.  We've got girls coming in today, and Robin's here with sex toys and stuff, so...  All right.  We're going to try to set something up with Big A and the girls.  They had a fly-in from L.A.  A murder?  Because the local girls don't do anything anymore.  So now Steve and Steve... 
[01:06:00]  Well, I think we put that little misconception to sleep yesterday.  Yeah.  You've got to get the right dance demographic.  The local girls do plenty.  We just got...  Yeah.  Yuck.  Yeah.  It was horrific.  So we'll get Big A in here and the girls that flew in from L.A., and we'll see if we  can get some radio magic to happen, okay?  Right.  And one other thing before we go to break.  Andy in Fresno.  Andy!  Hey, yeah.  I started listening to your show about five months ago, and you had all these inside references. 
[01:06:30]  I had no idea what the fuck was going on.  But your Wikipedia, or however the fuck you pronounce that entry, explains everything  very nicely for the new listeners.  Very good.  How did they get there?  Uh, you have to know how to spell Wikipedia, which is the hardest thing on Earth.  So you spell Wikipedia...  There are links on Wackbag.  Just go there.  Oh, there are links on Wackbag?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got one for Ryan and Fez, too.  All right.  And you can catch up on the show?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  Thank you, Andy. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  By the way, we need to do three things in the very near future.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree.  Keith's going to be bringing in homeless people every week leading up to that.  And I think it's going to be, what, the third week in December?  I think we're nailing down a date very, very soon.  We also...  I was reminded yesterday, Anthony, we got to do the second annual eggnog drinking contest.  That was a year ago already.  That's how we met Pat from Wynaki.  Who could possibly beat Pat?  And what'd you have to do?  Just drink it until you puked? 
[01:07:30]  Drink, uh...  What was it?  One shot?  One shot a minute.  A minute.  Until you puked or couldn't continue in any way, shape, or form, or had to take a piss.  We had ten guys, something like ten guys, and Pat from Wynaki, a shot of eggnog, and  how long did they go?  I'm trying to remember.  Like, Pat did...  Pat did 70...  70-something.  70.  Where's Pat?  What was it?  Yeah, 70-something shots.  Give us a quick call before we go to break, Pat.  Of, uh...  Yeah.  One-ounce shots.  And they were puking one after another.  And then Pat finally just, uh... 
[01:08:00]  Pat had won, and he kept doing them.  Like, just to see how many more he could do for the record.  It wasn't even close.  And then he put his fingers down his throat, and we have the sound.  Where's the sound?  Yeah, I gotta find it.  This is the actual sound of Pat puking up all of the eggnog he had drank that day.  Well, but this, uh...  We gotta say this.  He's a diabetic.  And he did his main shots, and then we're like, alright, make it an even 70, or whatever  we said.  And he was still fine.  So, he can't have all that sugar in him, obviously. 
[01:08:30]  So then he made himself puke by sticking his fingers down his throat.  Is that how he lost his toe?  Yep.  So...  That is how he lost his toe.  Diabetic, uh...  Here's the audio.  ...screw up.  It's famous audio.  We play this all the time.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  No, that was all...  No, that was all... 
[01:09:00]  It's just...  ...gallons pouring out of him into a garbage pail.  I love the Anthony laugh in that  there's something about puking  and he continued to puke  but that was the best clip we got out of it  he must have puked for like 15 minutes 
[01:09:30]  just over and over and over again  until he got it all out  on the line the reigning champ  Pat Frumanaki  there he is  morning fellas  what's up Pat  here's the season  look what a jolly guy he is  and Pat would you compete this year?  I sure would  that's what I drank those 35 extra shots for  35 extra  what was your final tally?  how many shots did you do? 
[01:10:00]  I don't know  I've been trained for my competitive eating endeavors  so  no I mean last year  how many did you end up doing?  oh I did 140 ounces  but how many shots was that?  was that 70?  that was 70  yeah  because they were 2 ounce shots  okay so it was 70 shots  second place did like 34  yeah  no one's going to be Pat  should a diabetic be a competitive eater  by the way?  why not?  Pat? 
[01:10:30]  well I take care of that  at the end of the contest there  what you puke it up?  oh not  not at the end of the meeting  no they're just  it's only a 10 minute contest  and I don't eat  like a day before  and I don't eat  like the day after  oh okay  so it kind of equals out  it kind of averages out  yeah  so there's no shock to your system there  you're not going through any sort of extremes with your body  Bill shut up  don't ruin it  we don't care  all we care is that he comes in for the second annual eggnog drinking contest 
[01:11:00]  it's not a contest without Pat  gurgle gurgle  and I don't think there's a man alive  that could beat Pat this year  there's no way  there's no way that you could beat 70  there's no way  Pat could have kept going  we just said alright  this is getting boring  let's keep it  let's just go to 70  dude he was a rookie though  I was pretty much at my limits  I was ready to burst  you were a rookie back then  now you're a pro  I think you're going to do better than you did last year  I'm betting Pat 
[01:11:30]  actually let me think  70 shots last time  what's the betting line right here  30 more  I think it'll crack 100  OP's good at encouraging me  56  that's a weird number  alright  do you think you could  do you think you could break 100 shots this year  never know  that's when the incentives in your contract kick in  that's like making the all-star team  the bonuses 
[01:12:00]  you know yesterday we threw this thing together as a goof  this year we gotta go all out  we have to  a betting line  everything  divisions  not even  just a betting line  and maybe  maybe take this on the road  maybe to a small arena  in front of the directors guild  maybe just  yeah exactly  can you imagine  across the street  maybe just a  I don't know  maybe just a small room  how funny would it be to just set up the contest there  set it up right in front on the sidewalk 
[01:12:30]  and just  yeah  across the street  we announce it  out the window  and just have people puking on the sidewalk  that could be really funny  or if he pukes somewhere else  you get  the guy who comes in second  has to take the bucket of puke  and go over there  and knock on the door  and as the guy looks  he just  throw it  you know  you do that  cool hand Luke challenge  with the  hard boiled eggs  yeah  get mad at them eggs  yeah no  it's the eggnog thing  but I think we should find 
[01:13:00]  maybe a small club  to do this in  and just invite maybe 20-25 listeners  a very special ticket Anthony  and then  and then we'll see what happens next year  maybe we  expand it a little bit  no  yeah  why not  sounds good  instead of just having it in the studio  alright  Pat we're going to set this up  in the very near future  we don't have enough  that's going to be great  we don't have enough puking on this show Bill  our greatest  puking show ever  was the one we did in Boston  by the way  the greatest  ever  we had Super Bowl tickets 
[01:13:30]  we had just the tickets  and where was the Super Bowl that year  New Orleans  was it New Orleans  I think it was New Orleans  okay  and we didn't have a way  for you to get there  and we were in East Coast  just tickets  we were in East Coast show  so a winner was going to be  from  somewhere from Washington  to Boston  let's say  they would have to find their own way  so it wasn't even that special of a prize  but we had two tickets to the Super Bowl  right  so we had  what was that one called  the  oh the  clam chowder  yeah 
[01:14:00]  the Boston  the  New England  clam chowder  eating contest  oh my god  oh yeah  it was disgusting  it was horrific  and we didn't really figure it out  ahead of time  like  we thought these guys  could eat a few bowls each  no problem  no way  so we're giving them  a bowl of chowder  filled right to the tippy top  mmm  brimming  brimming with goodness  and these people  were bailing so fast  it wasn't even funny  the puke  I mean the puking  that was going on that day  and then 
[01:14:30]  oh dude  it gets a lot better  so then  so then  we got a winner  and then  we happened to have  another pair of tickets  so then we started  another contest  where  we got some volunteers  from the people  that were puking  to re-enter the contest  and the new contest  was to eat  the puke  no  no  oh yeah  what was it  a spoonful each  oh yeah  no  oh yeah  come on 
[01:15:00]  no  a spoonful  a spoonful  oh that is so fucking  disgusting  so they went around  the puke bucket  I forgot how many  you know  maybe oavirus.com  could like  post a show  so people could listen to this  and  and one by one  they would take a scoop  of the puke  and then they started  puking more  because of that  yeah they're puking more  because they  they're eating puke 
[01:15:30]  and I think if I remember  did they realize  the game was televised  at that point  like  yeah  yeah this isn't  an exclusive thing  you can actually see it  and if I remember correctly  they would have to take  a spoonful of the puke  right  and then they would have  they would have to  hold it in them  for like two minutes  or something like that  and if they could  hold it in them  it was like  it was like  a sudden death  type of competition  the first guy  to hold it in them  for like two minutes  you would see people  like alright  I'm good  I'm good  I'm good 
[01:16:00]  and they're just  fighting it  with every muscle  in their body  and they're like  no I'm good  and then you see  their eyes watering  they're sweating  and pale  and they start  gulping  like this  and then they would  lose it  and then the whole place  would just start  screaming like  oh my god  and then other people  that are not even  in the contest  started puking  there was so much  puking going on  that day  and then finally  someone kept it down  for the time limit  and they won  the other pair of tickets 
[01:16:30]  man  it was unbelievable  it was hilarious  so Pat  yes  we're going to do  the eggnog  drinking contest  and we should do it soon  I'll be there  we should do it  right after Thanksgiving  Anthony  because you know  to welcome in  the Christmas season  yeah  we should do that  in early December  alright  do you want to  just do it in the studio  or do you want to  try to take this one  on the road somewhere  I don't know  I kind of like the studio  yeah  yeah 
[01:17:00]  yeah  the listeners  are all involved  that's boring though  what  I want  I want  I want people  puking in front  of an audience  we'll invite people in  hey  by that time  we should have  all the cubicles  cleared out  this place will be huge  yeah  they can all sit there  like they're witnessing  like an execution  no the cubicles  are going soon  are they  oh yeah  oh yeah  are they  really  oh yeah  Ryan in Brooklyn  yeah  I can beat that  nine-toed diabetic freak  you think 
[01:17:30]  you think  you can do  70 shots of eggnog  I can do  100 easy  yeah  I'm not even a good boy  stalking sheep  fanget  wow  wow  everybody  everybody thought  they'd do  a good job  against Pat  and all of them  failed miserably  I'll eat your eight toe  we might have to have  a preliminary round  because there's going to be  a lot of  all talk type of people  calling up  you want to  weed out some of the people  that are just going to  puke right away  I don't know  Ryan  it's Brian actually  yeah what's up 
[01:18:00]  oh Brian  are you a big guy  I'm 225  225  511  511  you would have to do  two ounces of eggnog  every single minute  until you puke  or not puke  not a problem  put a little room  and I'll be even happier  alright  and we've got to get  some good prizes  maybe a mi-fi  and some other stuff  alright Ryan  just keep close  we'll announce  the details soon  and then just call back  always  well if I don't hear  Kobayashi on the line  I'm okay  alright 
[01:18:30]  see now we've got  just a lot of people  calling up saying  they could beat Pat  all talk though  Sonny Farrelly  from Boston  a faithful listener  of the program  does a lot of  assaults on the media  in the Boston area  Sonny  hey guys  what's happening  hey man  hey  I'm challenging Pat  I'm going to beat him  you really think  you can do at least 70  hey I'm 280  at 511  doesn't matter  how big  how small you are  doesn't matter  I've seen Pat 
[01:19:00]  in action  he's an animal  he was doing  when everyone  was suffering  trying to get down  they would pick up  the shot  and have  I guess a minute  to down it  before they have to  do the next one  yeah  and they would sit there  struggling  trying  with like 3 seconds left  barely getting the last bit down  then they'd have to pick up  the next shot  and do that  and Pat is just  ha ha ha  next one  yeah  this is great  little beverage  like he's joking  and just tossing him back  like it was nothing  he was taunting  the rest of the contestants  psyching him out 
[01:19:30]  in his own bizarre way  yummy  because everyone  he's going yummy  oh can I have another  and everyone else  is just suffering  on the brink of puking  and I mean everyone  they're sweating  there's not one guy  that was even close  to beating Pat  yeah no  I think I can do it  alright  alright Sonny  we have your info  oh absolutely  alright hold on  we're going to start  getting contestants right now  just so we have a list  yeah but to keep it interesting  you've got to get some guys  who are going to puke early  you know what I mean 
[01:20:00]  yeah  just to keep it going  there's always the early pukers  that's no problem  there's always early pukers  a lot of these guys  don't know what they're  getting themselves into  last year there was a few guys  that were talking a lot of shit  and they were out  after like 10 shots  they went down very early  140 ounces  how many like  is that like a  how many gallons  we tried figuring it out  but we sucked at math  after the show  and failed miserably  and it took about an hour  for us to get  8 wrong answers  we're fucking retarded  and this is with calculators  and everything else 
[01:20:30]  yeah I don't know any of that  how many  yeah what is a pint  and an ounce  there's a pint  and there's 16 ounces  in a pint  how many pints  in a quart  and then there's 4 quarts  in a gallon  how many pints  are in a quart  dude that's 386 gallons  I think that's a half a quart  it's an astronomical unit  alright  let's say hi to Joe in Queens  Joe was in the contest  last year  about a gallon  and a half maybe  hey what's up boys  hey 
[01:21:00]  yeah I was in the contest  last year  I was in the ugly brown sweater  and I remember  it's not just the eggnog  but the fact that  getting there about 4 in the morning  waiting on line  then starting the contest  then  if you don't puke  you have the shakes  and the yellow shits  for the next 4 days  it is just the most  grueling thing in the world  the yellow shits  it's the most grueling thing  in the world  that's a quote from Joe  well these athletes  are used to that  oh it involves 
[01:21:30]  no one beating Pat  I mean  I can confirm  the yellow smoothie shits  thank god  you can confirm that  yeah  it's really bad  just in case  you thought Joe was lying  oh no  Pat has confirmed it  god damn Pat  not just that  I didn't have to deal  with whoever else was puking  I wound up on I think  the fifth or sixth  but the smell in the studio  from everyone else puking  yeah because it's just  a couple of garbage pails  that are sitting there open  and when people start puking  the wafting smell of vomit 
[01:22:00]  fills the studio  and it starts making people  on the brink  yeah  people that are on the brink  in charge of the garbage pails  I believe  yeah  yeah I thought I was going to be able  to do pretty well  but you know  after each minute  you know the first five  actually the first ten  were going down pretty easy  and I thought  I was like  oh this is nice  by about fifteen or twenty  forget it  yeah you just shot him in  and it's easy  oh yeah  but then  I remember there was  the one guy next to me  who got it down  right before Anthony 
[01:22:30]  hit the belt  and got it down  in a fifteen-yard second  he's like  oh good down  good go again  and that guy did about  a half a sip  and he was done  and then watching in awe  as Pat  just kept going  and going  he's like  oh I'm thirsty today  I guess  taunting  my victory lap  it's like Jackie Gleason  in the beginning of The Hustler  Paul Newman's nodding off  and he's all fresh  and that's it  so Pat  I take my hat off to you  and let's see if you can 
[01:23:00]  hit triple digits this time  oh thank you  alright  and that's what made Pat  a star on this program  yes it is  but boys  if I can't do it  is there a chance  that I can just watch  from the studio  I think we should have  a former contender  able to watch  yeah of course  we'll figure it out  alright thank you very much  maybe we can push  these cubicles back  a little bit  and have a little  studio audience  I just love the whole idea  of shit talking  as you're drinking eggnog  instead of like the sports  like you can't cover me  motherfucker  it's like yummy  yummy delicious  mmm  I'll have another 
[01:23:30]  and that's just  that's just as defeating  oh it is  in that contest  oh it is  it's a guy you just can't cover  because people are looking over  just going  there's no way  I'm beating this guy  I am so ready to puke  and he is fresh as a daisy  yummy  let's go to Eric  yummy  Eric  hey this is Eric  from Wisconsin  I don't know if I can beat him  but I sure like to try it  I stand about 6'8  and I'm 726 pounds  from Grenoble France  I'd like to know

[01:36:00]  Pat did  70 shots  I think  I could  turn it  on  I'm a  bottomless  pit  alright  hold on  the line  Tommy  alright  that's it  for now  I guess  yeah  we'll take  more as  time goes  on  for the  contest  we just  gotta figure  out a day  we'll do  that very  soon  something  that's  happening  on 202  this weekend  it's the  start of  something  we really  want to start  jazzing up  the weekends  on this  fine channel  instead of  playing a lot  of replays  jazzing up  jazzing up 
[01:36:30]  we want to  do interesting  things  and I guess  we're gonna  start with  Black Earl  yeah  we can only  go up from  there  I think  if we start  low  we aim  low  set the  bar low  I think  the next  thing we do  is gonna  look pretty  good  I'm hoping  but this  Saturday  what time  is it gonna  be  at midnight  yeah  midnight  to two  midnight  tonight  or midnight  tomorrow  midnight  Saturday  into two  Sunday  morning  okay 
[01:37:00]  so  midnight  tomorrow  black  Earl  his dream  comes true  here it is  he gets to do  his black  rock coalition  for two hours  without us  goofing on it  you've heard  about this  for years  if you've been  fans of the  opium anthony  show  black girl's  dream  is to host  his own show  called the  black rock  coalition  sounds very  militant  doesn't it  whenever you  put a  coalition  black rock  coalition  and it's  rock  but opium 
[01:37:30]  it's done  by black  artists  so it's  not your  normal  it's not  hip hop  you know  not really  is it  R&B  I don't know  I think it's  like hard  rock  it's a little  of everything  I guess  but done  by black  artists  he said he'll  play some  Billy Preston  yeah  so basically  I think what  he's doing  is anybody  who isn't  rapping  and they're  black  that's pretty  much  black  rock  coalition  and it's  not funk  I guess  the fifth  dimension  and is it 
[01:38:00]  true that  Marilyn McCoo  and Billy Davis  Jr.  and is it  true that  you guys  are going to  be hanging  out  yeah we'll  be around  I heard  that Nathaniel  Travis  Danny  Eric  maybe Derek  they're all  just going to  go to a  bar  tomorrow night  and then come  back just in  time for the  black rock  coalition  the bar  part is a  very good  idea  yeah  then you'll  be all  hammered  do we have  a way of  recording the  phone calls  off air  like  hmm  because a lot  of people  are going to  be reacting  to this  show 
[01:38:30]  I don't know  how many  calls Earl  is going to  be taking  I don't even  know if he's  capable of  taking a live  phone call  oh so you  want to take  the calls  yeah like if  you have Nathaniel  or someone else  in another  studio and they  see the same  phone screen  where you guys  could actually  tape  tape the phone  like what the  phone screener  can hear  so we can  play this on  Monday on  our show  because there's  going to be a  lot of interesting  comments about  this show  Ramon  and we don't  want Earl  editing the  phone calls  and just  picking the  ones that  are very  favorable  we're getting 
[01:39:00]  a preliminary  yes on that  we can do  that  you know what  I'm looking  for right  yeah  alright so you  guys go  somewhere else  you'll see the  calls coming in  like crazy  and you record  them and then  I want a nice  montage of some  of the phone  calls that come  in during his  show  alright and  then we'll have  some fun with  that on  Monday  alright but  these guys  took it upon  themselves to  make sweepers  for Black  that's nice  Black Earl's  Black Rock  Coalition show  that will be on  202 tomorrow  night at midnight  east coast time  you know that's very  nice of you guys 
[01:39:30]  supporting Earl  like this  give him a little  production because  he's probably busy  himself just trying  to get the show  together  right  we're on the  same team  can we get Earl  on the phone by the  way  if possible  you want to  hear some of  the sweepers  we're on the  same team  he's a sarcastic  son of a bitch  that's why we  love him  let's get Earl  on the phone  and hear some  of the sweepers  you guys came up  with for Earl  Earl  it's the Black  Rock Coalition  with Black Earl  Douglas  he's black  black 
[01:40:00]  well he is  it's accurate  if nothing else  all right  that's good  Earl  very busy  he's got  Ron and Fez's  show to produce  and now he's  producing his own  program for  Saturday night  wow  attempting to be  a radio star  himself  here's another  sweeper the boys  came up with  it's the Black  Rock Coalition  yay  wow that's black 
[01:40:30]  here it comes  kids  hold on  your hats  so you're  concentrating more  on the black  than the rock  part of this  Earl does dress  all in black  did you guys  get drunk  after we left  yesterday  no this is  just I guess  late afternoon  punchiness  you're listening  to the first  and last  Black Rock  Coalition  I think Earl's  going to use  some of these 
[01:41:00]  yeah  I see him  popping these  in between  a few artists  you're listening  to the Black  Rock Coalition  with Black  Earl Douglas  where you'll  hear music  from Fishbone  Living Colors  Fishbone  and  and  seal  turns out we  can't record  calls off air  no 
[01:41:30]  why  there's no setup  for it  he said  there's no setup  for it  hold on  how do you  screen phone  calls  Danny  question  how do you  screen the  phone calls  do you pick  up an actual  handset  yeah  and like  you would at  home  and go  hello  and the person  on the phone  goes  I'd like to  talk about  and you hear  them through  your ear  in the headset  well technically  we could do it  we could take  one of those  yeah like  Radio Shack  sells phone  bugging equipment  not even  we could just 
[01:42:00]  rig it with  one of the  mp3 recorders  the portable  recorders  that we have  yeah  put it on  speaker  there you go  I'm starting  to get really  pissed off  behind the  scenes  we need  people around  us that  can figure  out the  problems  I'm sick  of hearing  we can't  do something  right away  they think  too technical  sometimes  too technical  yes if he's  taking a phone  call in there  that can't be  heard on the  air  and it's the  same people  that are  calling in  you can  absolutely 
[01:42:30]  get recordings  of it  yes  you want  an actual  phone call  as soon as  he picks  it up  right  he's not  going to  have a  screen  Earl  right  well  Earl's  doing his  show  I don't  know  what  we don't  so he  we have  no idea  what Earl's  doing  we just  want  so we  can have  some cool  shit to  play on  Monday  we want  our guys  taking some  of these  phone calls  however we  can make  that happen  so we  get recordings  of that  he's going  to have  callers  and he's  not going  to have  a screener 
[01:43:00]  so he  sees a  call  he picks  it up  and whatever  that person  says  is going  to be  on the  air  why isn't  he going  to have  a screener  because he's  going to  do it  out of  a compact  studio  he's not  doing the  black rock  coalition  from this  studio  no he's  not  why  why not  it's easier  out of that  studio  for one  person  to do  the show  that's the  colored studio  I didn't  know this  was a  white  only  studio  don't you  see the  sign over  there  that explains  the fountain  the water 
[01:43:30]  fountain  back there  and the  restroom  why is it  easier though  this place  has a  microphone  and two  CD  he's  going to  need  someone  in the  producer's  side  if he  uses  this  yeah but  we got  all our  guys  that's  all they're  doing  Saturday  night  is getting  drunk  and watching  Earl fall  flat on his face  somebody can produce  from that room  I'll keep it below  a .0  but isn't the  objective to get a  call that's  candid and without  a call screener  is that what you  want to do  yeah but we  don't want to  miss out  let's say  Earl only takes 
[01:44:00]  three calls  the entire night  he's not going to  take a lot of  calls  and the phones  are lit up  we want to hear  what those people  want to say  so we actually  want the  screening process  to be recorded  that's pretty much  the goal  so somebody  can call him  and go  this fucking  blows  and the screener  can go  why does it  suck  maybe ask him  a few questions  about why he  thinks it blows  or it's great  or whatever  it blows  and then  hang up  but we'll have  that recorded  if Earl doesn't  take one call  the whole night  it doesn't matter  how many  calls are 
[01:44:30]  ringing here  live  we need  the screener  one of our  guys  to be able  to plunk  those down  and ask  the guys  a few  questions  right  is that  possible  yes  if we do  it out  of this  studio  then we should  Earl deserves  the white  studio  who wants  to volunteer  to help  out Earl  I'll raise  my hand  I don't mean  it and I won't  but I'll raise  my hand  and I'll follow  Anthony's example  like a sheep  yeah one of our  guys will help 
[01:45:00]  out  because it would  make for great  radio on Monday  okay we'll figure it  out  all right  thank you Mars  I appreciate it  all right  there you go  we'll figure it  out  also  you can use  the FU line  with your comments  oh  that's good  so at least  we're guaranteed  to get some stuff  so when  Earl's doing  his Black Rock  Coalition  tomorrow night  at midnight  on this fine  channel  it's a two hour  show  featuring black  artists  you can comment  by calling up  the FU line  how's that  Earl's like  the Rosa Parks  of the studios  they want to put 
[01:45:30]  them in the little  one  no  no I say  he's sitting  in Opie's chair  the whitest guy  in the whole room  he refused to  give it up  to a white DJ  right  he can sit  in my chair  this is famous  well  let's make sure  you throw the  chair away  something  it's Black  Earl Douglas  with the Black  Rock Coalition  the music  is so rockin  so black  black has  melted midnight  hello  this is Earl 
[01:46:00]  melted midnight  that's a killing  man  that is black  isn't it  he's taking this  very serious  he is  this is years  in the making  people  I can't stress  to you enough  how long  this has been  Earl's dream  he brought it up  to everybody  over at WNEW  and I mean  everybody  from the lowly  intern  to the  top dog  at the time  Ken Stevens  the general manager  and everyone  in between  everyone on the air 
[01:46:30]  this project  is his baby  his dream  and he comes here  and he's  finally  he is going to  get to put it  on the air  it's a feel good  story  it certainly is  a man in his dream  yep  oh it's not  coming true  it's not going to  feel good on Monday  you're listening  to the very last  Black Rock Coalition  hello  this is Earl  XM202  you know  I love Earl  almost like a brother 
[01:47:00]  but man  this is  like a brother  or like a brother  like a brother  like a brother  but I gotta tell you  I've heard a lot of  ideas in my time  this is the worst  radio idea ever  it has to be said  there's just not  enough black artists  it's so niche  it's so niche  that even XM  won't touch it  right  on the bright side  he's really sticking  with it  oh yeah  yeah  that's drive  determination  can I do the  White Rapper  Coalition  program after that 
[01:47:30]  feel free  Eminem  and Snow  Vanilla Ice  Snow  and Snow  Beastie Boys  Beastie Boys  you have more  artists to choose  from than Earl  does  and that's it  Marky Mark  Marky Mark  Funky Punch  wow that's about it  you make a great  comparison though  Bill  White Rapper  Coalition  we should do that  man as a goof  you want to do it  how funny would that  be  Elo loves it  and it takes off 
[01:48:00]  then I gotta host  that  that garbage  stole it from Earl  the Black Rock  Coalition  so blind people  can hate them too  uh-uh  no you didn't  alright well  so those are some  first thoughts  they're calling him  the Black Rudy  the movie Rudy  he's getting one shot  to go out there  and show what he's got  it says  the Black Rudy  without the football 
[01:48:30]  or the urge  to really want to succeed  yeah let's just be honest  and they're putting him  in garbage time  that's what I was gonna say  let's be honest  about the Black Rudy  yes  it's the fourth quarter  and it's a hundred to eight  get in there Earl  and give it your all  Rudy  Rudy  there's a minute left  in the game  have fun  here's your dream  now go home  that movie was so  unbelievable  because of the dude  they picked  to play Rudy  and then in the end  when they showed the picture 
[01:49:00]  of the real Rudy  I get it  he looks like  fucking Lyle Alzado  yeah  really  yeah I mean  he was a much  smaller version  but he looked  like a psycho  yeah  alright well  it's gonna be  a big big night  for Black Earl  but it's the start  of something new  for the Opie and Anthony  channel here  if this doesn't work out  Earl is gonna  try his  jump to conclusions  math  that he puts  on the floor  for those  office space fans  out there  jump to conclusions 
[01:49:30]  you put a bunch  of conclusions  on a mat  and you jump  to them  it's a worse  idea than  to jump  to conclusions  math  well we should  do one of these  ideas a week  so we got  Black Girl  and the Black Rock  Coalition  this weekend  on 202  and don't forget  the rapping  grandma  could play her  too  from Wedding Singer  and 400  other movies  where white  granny raps  let's start  thinking about  what we want 
[01:50:00]  to do next  weekend  on the channel  maybe one  of the pests  should get a show  for two hours  a pest  if you guys  got a good idea  give us a call  and we'll just  throw you on the air  gotta have an idea  though  yeah you gotta have  a good idea  and we'll throw you  on the air  next weekend  no problem  for two hours  this channel  will be yours  for two hours  the pests  have been doing  such a great job  for us  behind the scenes  I think the pests  deserve time  on this channel  I think there's  so many people  on the message board  that really seem  to know radio  know how to do  it so well 
[01:50:30]  they remind us  on a daily basis  how we should  be doing it  that they'd probably  do a great job  coming in here  and doing radio  and Danny will be  here to board up  I was thinking  the Than and Dan show  Than and Dan show  well the name itself  you'd get jobs  all over the country  with that  uh oh  are there  sorry I see Opie  looking for fun  would it be  Than and Dan  or Dan and Than  I don't think it's first  hooray for that idea  I'm not doing  anything over here 
[01:51:00]  hooray for that idea  I don't think  you have any of those  hooray for that idea  who would get  top billing  is it Than and Dan  or Dan and Than  probably me  why  because I'm me  sorry  because you got  the unusual name  that's all  more radio experience  yes I do  alright that's usually  the criteria  no the unusual  the unusual name  goes first  that's all  that's all it's about  yeah  it doesn't mean  anyone's better  than the other person  what was that great 
[01:51:30]  story that your old  PD  about your old  PD at the bone  oh yeah  he uh  I had done some  improv  and he  so he thought that  as an acting  experience  and he didn't  like my delivery  and so  listening to my  air checks  and he said  well you're an actor  right  why don't you act  like a DJ  and where's that  guy today  um  is he talking  uh  on a microphone  to the entire  country right now  no he isn't  exactly  those  those little  tidbits 
[01:52:00]  they stick with you  through your career  yeah  and you collect them  like cards  or anything else  and uh  you'll remember that  forever  yep  and the more  successful you get  the funnier those  little things get  those tidbits  alright  let's say hi  to Dave Douglas's  words of wisdom  to us  let's say hi  to Jesse in New Jersey  Jesse  hey what's up boys  how's it going  hey  hey don't you guys  remember what happened  to the last black guy  that had a dream  oh  wow  oh  let's go to Peter  in Jersey  Peter  Skeeter 
[01:52:30]  Skeeter  Skeeter  Skeeter  what's up  should have gone  with Peter  that works  um  hey you should  remember what happened  when um  you guys had  uh  if you guys take  callers  for you know  for the show  Black Rock Coalition  yes  it's never gonna work  because remember  what happened  to Billy Staples  when he opened  for Norton  and they booed  the shit out of him  because all the listeners  knew you know  knew what he was gonna do  and they just ruined  the whole thing for him  well see this is why  we know what we need  Earl's not gonna take  a lot of phone calls  because it's a music show  it's gonna be a lot 
[01:53:00]  of black artists  strung together  with Earl saying  absolutely nothing  in between the records  hopefully some interviews  though with some people  so perhaps he'll open up  the phone lines for uh  he's not gonna open up  the phones  I'm telling you  that's why we need  to take the phone calls  somewhere else  so we could see  what the people  were thinking  as this show  was on the air  but he's not gonna  get any phone calls  anyway  because not many  black people  have satellite  so  oh boy  alright  alright guys  let's go to  Josh in PA  Josh  yeah  hey guys  how's it going  hey  hey  I have an idea 
[01:53:30]  for you guys  for the pest  for the radio show  maybe you should  name it like  whack bag radio  you know  it's got a good  ring to it  whack bag radio  yeah  well that's  that could be  their slug line  but they gotta  come up with  a concept  for a show  ah damn it  what  breaking news  what  Sirius Satellite  just signed  the Than and Dan  show for  8.5 million dollars  Jesus Christ  we missed the boat  on that  again  damn it  sorry guys 
[01:54:00]  alright Josh  it's been good  alright  whack bag radio  I like the  name of the show  but you still  have to come up  with the actual show  ok so we'll  figure that out  you guys  you'll take it  upon yourself  to make sure  we get some  reaction  absolutely  alright you can  call the FU line  definitely while  Earl's on the air  and we'll weed  through those calls  and get the good  ones ok  and we'll work out  how to record  exactly  we're gonna  take a break  we'll get  Big A in here  next  and Robin 
[01:54:30]  see what kind  of sex toy  she brought in  today  Robin  and then we  got some  very hot girls  from the west  Robin  also sitting out  there  ok  want to go to  break with  some of that  fag talk  we used to play  are we  announcing  Arch Enemy  today  like Elo said  good question  good question  we should have  asked him that  because  a lot of  capital letters  being instant  feedback to me  and you know  what caps equal  everybody  yelling  ban  do you just

[02:05:00]  and that was  exciting for all of us  our boss Eric Logan  did a great job  uh oh  you don't like  the ELO though  right?  no  actually  he did a great job  I actually love  the XM stuff  I love the new  little XM to go  thing  I wish we would  have gotten to  keep those  we got to play  with a couple  of them  for the three days  they didn't even  let you keep them?  they didn't even  let you keep them?  no  they took them up  real quick  and we're like  no  these are fun  yeah  it's going to be  the item  this Christmas season  you watch  I think so  I think it's going  to be the replacement  if it was a little  bit smaller 
[02:05:30]  and the earphones  were more comfortable  it'd be the replacement  for the iPod  did you think  Eric Logan  was cute?  you know  at first I did  but you know  he's a little old  for me  old?  yeah  and you know  I was just  listening to y'all  show a little bit  is this Queer Eye  for the Straight Guy  or a talk radio show  it can drift  into a different  explain that  well y'all were  giving this guy  fashion tips  going tucked  untucked 
[02:06:00]  put your hair back  oh if you saw him  no no no  the guy's a fat slob  we were joking  well maybe  this guy has  we can't help this guy  yeah  I should send him  to Jenny Craig  instead  no we're going  to have a girl  that can squirt  her own orgasm  what a hack reference  15 feet  and going to  squirt him  right in the face  yeah this guy's  going to get  squirted in the face  yes  from a porn star  a hot porn star  you know  I would really  take a heavy bath  after that  yeah  yeah  not my thing 
[02:06:30]  now  I watched you  get the boot  there last night  did you watch  the whole show  yes  great  have you watched  all the shows  this season  most of them  yeah  most of them  of course  you don't come  across too well  in the show  there  well editing  you know the bitch  everyone  playing the editing  I'm not going to go there  I'm not going to go there  no  because you know  it is what it is  you say what you can say  whether they twist  your words around or not  you still said it  or it was still said  at different times  the things that you didn't see  in this task  actually you know  the things that you did see 
[02:07:00]  in this task  is that I was right  about the type of song  we should have had  for XM Cafe  but Rebecca  who's a big hip hop  R&B fan  wanted to have  and turn this guy  who looks like Seal  and sounds like Seal  into you know  Tommy Lee I guess  or 50 Cent  or something like that  and that doesn't fit  on your XM Cafe station  so regardless of what  Randall did  of putting the wrong  station on there  it was about the artist  in the end  and we were told  you know  you didn't use your artist  to his fullest ability  and because of that  I got fired 
[02:07:30]  but Clay  no one liked you  on the show  well you know what  when you're the most  creative person there  and you speak your mind  you know  I like old IMAS  over on MSNBC  I'm going to say it  like it is  and there's so many people  that come on The Apprentice  that don't work for themselves  and are afraid to buck  I guess the man  no  they're like  no I can't go  against the world  you know  I can't go  no I can't speak up  and do it  because they think  oh well the project manager  is going to say this  will go along  with the project manager  so that if they fail  it's their butt down the drain  do you think  your alternative lifestyle 
[02:08:00]  might have played a part  you know  I would never  will know that  because it was never  said to my face  yeah  they never showed  any of it on camera  no  and so I'll really  never know the answer  to that question  well you came across  very bitchy and needy  well that's all about  you know  that big E word  which we're not going to use  the E word  what's that  estrogen  no  the whole editing word  so  because you know  when they're trying  to make you look bad  to build you up  for failure  or anything else  that way  they've got to make  everyone else look good  kind of like  on last week's task 
[02:08:30]  where it was for  Star Wars  I got all the props  in the boardroom  from both  Lucas Entertainment  and from Best Buy  but they didn't show it  they both said  oh we love Clay  he did such an amazing job  and then after the show  was aired  I got all the people  who helped us  put together and design  the actual  unit itself  send me emails  going  we don't know  why they let this  all of it  take control  and show that  she had control  you're the one  that had control  the old time  you did all the work  she was just in the way  what do you think  of the Trump  what do I think  of the Trump  I think he 
[02:09:00]  ultimately wants  to be liked  so much  that he's willing  to do whatever  it takes  to get that attention  that he  for some reason  he's attention starved  as much attention  as he gets  it like feeds him  and he needs that  he's ultimately  that's weird  coming from you  because you sound like  well you look like  you needed a lot  of attention  during the show  you think so  oh my god  yeah  well  didn't have to  have attention  I just needed  respect  and you know  I wanted people  to listen to  every time  that I said  something  I ended up  being right  so you can't 
[02:09:30]  complain about that  all right  you liked your  experience on the show  the experience  on the show  was amazing  you know  I would change  a couple of things  but for the most part  I would definitely  do it again  all right  so would you ever  try out yourself  what  would you ever  have the balls  to try out yourself  balls to try  that show  no  right  why not  because it's  because it's like  business geeks  well  why not  Marcus made it on there  huh  Marcus made it on there  so  it's not our thing  well I mean  there's a million 
[02:10:00]  other reality shows  that we could do  besides that one  that's like  dude we hate that world  do you understand  you guys are all  young go-getters  kissing ass  and blah blah blah  looking apart  I don't think I kissed  ass at all  any time in this  which is probably  why I was hated  no it's just not  our cup of tea there  what would be  your cup of tea  on a reality show  that's out now  uh fear factor  really  no  would you  no  no  of course not  you better got a good stomach  so  but hey guys  thanks for having me  on your show this morning  thanks for giving me props  and who do you think 
[02:10:30]  is going to win  I think it's going to be  the girl with the crutches  or the black dude  wow  yeah  wow  interesting  why those two  huh  why those two  why those two  right  my guess is  my pick is Randall  who's Randall  the black guy  yeah the black dude  I think it's time  for a black dude to win  well regardless of that  he has the most  qualifications  the last guy  the last guy  you know  there's only one guy  left besides Randall  yeah  well  the little virgin  he's a virgin 
[02:11:00]  well  we think so  he would never answer  his question  when Trump asked him  so  now you're a gay gentleman  you think he has  some gay tendencies  you know  I was out last night  here in New York  and every single person  asked me that  do you think Adam's gay  do you think Adam's gay  I think Adam is asexual  asexual  I wish I knew  how to quit you  yeah  asexual huh  I think that he has been  suppressed his whole life  as far as that goes  that you know  it's such a shun  to think about  and you can't talk about it  and he 
[02:11:30]  has a clue  of what he's going to do  in that arena  so I think he'll figure it out  he seems like he's like  12 years old  on that show  like he never  grew up or something  there's something  really strange about him  oh really  he's a young one  yeah he's pretty young  he's the youngest guy  on the show  he's still in that age  where you like to  inflate everything  and say you've done  all this stuff  that you haven't  alright we're getting bored  thanks Clay  alright y'all too  bye  oh you like that  don't you faggot  I wish I knew  how to quit you  he tried to wrap 
[02:12:00]  it up himself  I heard somebody  getting interviewed  going  alright guys  thanks for me on  let's say hi  to Krista again  Krista the blind girl  Krista  ok I'm back now  yes  there she is  so what can we do  for you today  ok  I wanted to know  if Robin  had any masturbation  tips for me  since my wrists  have been hurting  and I was looking  to see if I can get  some toys or whatever  maybe have an  orgasm on the air 
[02:12:30]  how blind are you  totally blind  totally like  blackness blind  since when  since birth  since birth  wow  so you have no idea  you have no concept  of sight then  that's correct  like you don't even  understand what sight  means then  that's right  right  yeah  you don't think that  don't know what  anything looks like  just close your eyes  like someone has  to explain  how do they explain  sight to you  they don't do 
[02:13:00]  a great job  you know  because there's  people out there  that you know  they saw for a while  and then they went  blind so they  understand what sight  is but if you  were born without  ever seeing  that concept has  still got to be a  really strange thing  to you  yeah I don't  understand the  concept  there's a lot  of things I  don't  like when people  talk about  three-dimensional  drawing and  other types of  artistic concepts  I have no idea  what they're talking  about  you're fucking retarded  too  when you're touching  stuff and they go  you could see this  but Jesus  teasing of course 
[02:13:30]  but wait  I guess your dreams  would help you out  right  don't you see in your  dreams  no  I can't  how could I  that's not possible  she's got no  reference point  that's fucking  dreams  wait wait  dreams are only  what your mind  kind of concocts  during the night  when you're asleep  but it's based on  how would you not  do that  there are times  shut up Bill  there are times  on this show  where we learn  something for the  first time  like I assumed  all blind people  that were born blind  at least could see  in their dreams  what reference point  does your brain  have to conjure up  an image 
[02:14:00]  if you haven't  seen it  when you're awake  all of a sudden  you're going to be  asleep and you're  going to know  what things look like  hold on  we're going to get  into some pot talk  we needed some  good reefer now  because this is  where we get  to freak people out  dude  like when you're  dreaming  what do you  see  you don't see  but what  what is your  dreams then  like auditory  oh fuck that  alright now  here's something  I know about  mental images  you're able to  conjure up  images in your  mind  like anyone 
[02:14:30]  could shut  anyone could  shut their eyes  and conjure up  an image of  something  no no no  not an image  yeah  like if you  tell me to  imagine something  like a ball  yeah  and it's in my  hands  I'm imagining  feeling  yeah but you  know what the  shape is  can you just  like  imagine seeing  it no  you can't  visualize in  your head  a round  or a spherical  object  what's wrong  with you  I don't understand  that part of it  like through  what vision is  I know you  don't know  what vision is  but just see 
[02:15:00]  it for god's  sake  use your  mind's eye  my mind  I just can't  get past the  fact that even  in dreams  she's not  seeing shit  it's just like  a bunch of  talk  hello  hey he's saying  it's like  listening to the  radio  that's creepy  AI  hey um  you're being  chased and  you can't  run fast  your feet  feel like  cement  and this  bad guy's  chasing you  oh my god  it's like  books on tape  for her dream  and you know  you're what  moving  you're running 
[02:15:30]  or whatever  you're running  yeah I've  been running  but what is it  like you can't  see anything  bang into shit  hit a wall  no that's the  weird part  when in a dream  because dreams  are so illogical  yeah  that's how I know  where I'm going  that is strange  it is weird  I would think  you at least  have that  you get to see  in your dreams  illogical person  my dreams  are really  illogical  you don't  miss it  quickly without  any technical  stuff  what happened  what's wrong  with your  peepers  no optic nerve 
[02:16:00]  or something  no retina  no retina  what the hell  happened to your  retina  I wasn't there  you just were born  without a retina  it's genetic  other people in your  family got that  um  it's  no it's  it's  my parents are  carriers  great  thanks mom and pop  don't you love  that one  how long did it  take them to  figure out that  you were blind  were they like  tossing you the  ball in the  backyard  there were a hundred  guys at the bar  and mom picked  the one guy

[02:38:00]  Hey, college boy, you're next.  Nobody saw the accused.  Keep going, Krista.  We're almost done.  I don't think you're going to get much else here.  Unless I fake it or something.  No, no fake.  Just rub a little.  Look at us.  Yes, rub it.  Lie a whore.  Lie a whore.  You know it. 
[02:38:30]  I want to know.  Who's coming up with these lines?  Never mind.  Never mind?  It's a thankless job.  Anthony?  Everybody's chiming in.  Oh, everybody's chiming in?  Of course.  Go ahead.  Just keep going.  We're almost done.  My cock is going to make you see God. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, never mind.  That was actually good delivery on that.  You almost got it done.  Yeah.  All right.  We're always looking for the big finish here.  We're trying for the big finish.  Yeah, that's the thing.  I don't...  It's like you had me finish the job.  You know, you got the big finish before.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[02:39:30]  Big A, getting the job done.  Yeah, he sure is.  So is that all the instant feedback I hear rattling?  We're working.  Is that instant feedback? 
[02:40:00]  Let's hear the instant feedback.  Here's nothing...  Here's nothing that will matter in your eye.  Delivery's horrible on mine.  That was funny, though.  Gotta give it to you, Big A.  It's not rape if you can't see. 
[02:40:30]  What?  What?  I didn't hear that one.  It said it's not rape if you can't see.  Oh, my God.  Take your exam, flush it down with the toilet, and fuck your mother.  She's gonna go in.  Shh.  I like a finger in my ass. 
[02:41:00]  I'm, I'm, I'm Big A, and I'm on your clit. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, my God.  We almost had the big finish.  You got it already.  All right.  We'll, we'll end with this one.  Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS.  All right.  Krista the blind girl, everyone.  Krista.  Oh.  Wow.  She's still going.  Very nice. 
[02:42:00]  Like the aftereffect, you know.  Yeah.  Actually, no, we don't.  You just masturbate all day?  What's that?  You just masturbate all day?  What else does she have to do?  She's handicapable.  All right, Krista.  Thank you so much.  I go to school, you know.  Well, actually, you know, we're actually doing a women's sexual.  Oh, man.  After all that, you don't just hang up on the girl.  You're terrible. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, Rich, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Best bit ever.  Thank you very much.  I'm cracking up over here.  I just seemed to enjoy that one.  Hard on or what?  It was really funny.  It was hot and funny.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Blaze.  Blaze.  Hey, you guys are fucking awesome, man.  You guys saved my life.  Yeah, why? 
[02:43:00]  I had fucking stern fever, man.  And XM202 was the vaccine, boys.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, fuck the stern.  There you go, my friend.  It's the ONA virus that's spreading across America.  Straight to XM, man.  All right.  For real.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Steve in Illinois.  Steve.  Yeah, you guys fucking rock.  This is the best bit ever.  Now, I already voted on the fucking website what was the best bit.  Now I'm going to have to change my fucking vote.  Yeah, we're going to play the best bits we've done since coming to XM, and we're going to  have a huge, huge two-day special.  It's going to air the end of the year on 202. 
[02:43:30]  I think two weekends in a row it's going to air.  Thanks, Steve.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mark the Trucker.  Mark.  Hey, how you doing?  You guys have the funniest fucking show I've ever heard.  Oh, man.  Look at the accolades.  I was driving through North Carolina last night listening to your crack whore homeless lady,  man, and I about died laughing.  Crack whore.  Promise me you'll never play the Yoko Ono thing again, though.  I was about ready to drive this 18-wheeler off a bridge.  Oh, we played that yesterday, yes. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We should take a break.  We're not done with Big A.  We've got some girls that are going to squirt on you.  Can we put, like, a bullseye on your face?  Okay.  We've got to do it in a way where he can, you know, wash it off, though.  The girls out there have lipstick or something?  Oh, you've got the lipstick?  All right.  But as we go to break, Jesus Christ, man, totally prepared.  We are just goofing off today and having a lot of fun doing it, man. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  We'll play this little thing going into break, and we'll continue with Big A.  We'll get the girls in.  One of them can squirt, like, 15 feet or something, and, I don't know.  We'll figure it out as we go.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Play with my balls.  Play with my balls.  Oh, that feels so good. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Just roll them around.  It is so good.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  We do.  Uh-oh, slow down.  Oh, my God.  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel.  Nathan and Anthony Cyrus.  Get infected.  I want to make sure Steve is safe this hunting season.  Oh.  I kind of hoped I could get out of the studio before this thing starts. 
[02:45:30]  Has there, uh...  Well...  Has there been a problem?  Well, they got a bear problem in New Jersey, and Steve happens to live in New Jersey.  Where do you live, huh?  Oh, Jersey.  I live in Jersey.  That's right.  It's in Jersey.  Every once in a while, they allow the hunters to just start shooting bears in the fine state  of New Jersey.  Doesn't matter where that bear may be.  It could be in your backyard.  They don't give a fuck.  As long as they thin the herd a little bit.  You're right, Bill.  They want to take about 400 bears out, I think.  Something like that.  And the animal rights people come up, and they get all pissed off.  They just don't want people killing the bears. 
[02:46:00]  And then the hunters want to hunt bears, because it's fun for them.  And then the people that live in areas that have bears want them hunted, because you  don't want your little puggle to get eaten.  Of course, at night, when you put the little cute guy out back at the box.  Do we have audio of the hunters going out and shooting at the bears?  Oh, no.  I don't want to hear that.  Oh, this is the audio of the bear hunt.  Oh, they go against the guy. 
[02:46:30]  This sounds harrowing. 
[02:47:00]  Must have been very nerve-wracking.  Is this all in fast motion?  You can't take that, hunting.  Oh, foul.  What's Poe doing there?  What's Poe doing there?  Oh, and I, Poe, you rock!  Ha, hai, ho, and I.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:47:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, boy, and Anthony.  Send you to Ben.  There is no you. There is only me. There is no you. There is only me. There is no fucking you. There is only me. There is no fucking you. There is only me.  Let's go right to the phones and say hi to Joey in Illinois. Joey, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How are you? 
[02:48:00]  Bill?  Yes.  That is the best plug I have ever heard of anybody. Punch it out.  All right, yeah, Bill Burr doing a great job for us, and he'll be at Rascals in Montclair, New Jersey, Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving, and maybe Sunday.  Yeah, we're working that out. He's working that out as we speak. All right.  Big A, they didn't paint the bullseye on your face yet.  No.  What are we waiting for?  All right, let's get Robin in here, and Steve in here, and the girls in here. 
[02:48:30]  Danny's going to do the bullseye.  All right, yeah, I would start with a big circle right around his round face, all along the perimeter.  All along the perimeter.  Just the awkwardness.  Wait, it's got to be a weird bullseye, because don't you want the mouth to be ground zero?  Maybe.  No, the tip of the nose, I think.  The tip of the nose?  Yeah.  All right, I guess you're right, Anthony.  So go around and get his waddle, like with the first one. 
[02:49:00]  Under the double chin.  There you go.  Holy crap.  Now...  He's going to be out of lipstick by the time he goes around that much.  Yeah, really.  That's pretty good.  Wow.  Not bad.  Now go in, like so it almost cuts his eyeball in half.  Yeah, like through the eyebrow.  Like around the eyes.  Yeah, close your eyes.  Yeah.  Close your eyes, Biggie.  Close your eyes.  Around the eyes to his cleft of his chin.  There you go.  To the cleft of his chin.  Cleft right there.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Nice.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right, you need two more.  Two more.  One has got to go just inside his eye now.  He's got to go right over the eyelids.  Over the bridge of the nose, like right at the bridge eyebrow line, yeah.  There you go.  Right there.  Yeah, use his mouth as part of that line.  Very good.  Pop it across to his.  Very good.  Pucker, pucker.  Let's see.  Turn around.  Let's see, Biggie.  Yeah, put on some.  Yeah, pucker, yeah.  Pucker, yeah.  Connect that one.  Connect that one to the corner of his.  Yeah, you're going to have to wear lipstick.  There you go, because that's where the line goes.  All right, well, you might as well, the lipstick is upper lip, too. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  While you're at it.  Yeah, just like this.  There you go.  Now, now go.  No, no, no, no.  Rub your, no.  No, Big A, rub your lips together.  Go, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Okay.  And now.  Would you fuck me?  No.  I would fuck me.  Is that good enough, or do you need a circle on the nose?  Now you need a circle on the nose.  Right on the tip of the nose.  Oh, yeah.  That's the cork.  That's the cork.  Rudolph the red nose, reindeer nose.  That's perfect.  Let me see.  Let's see.  That is fucking perfect. 
[02:50:30]  God damn, Danny.  Good job.  God, you're going to have more pictures for your website, Big A.  Yep.  What's your website?  And more photoshops.  TheBigA.com  TheBigA.com  TheBigA.com  TheBigA.com  TheBigA.com  All right.  TheBigA.com  And your bullseyes all ready. 
[02:51:00]  And we have the girls here.  Ladies, please step up to the mic, if you would, or walk up to the one Nathaniel's holding.  I have something here for Andrew.  My God.  Jesus Christ, right?  Yes.  Wow.  Here you go.  What's that?  Oh.  Are you giving him?  She's handing him a mint.  I'm giving him a mint.  Very good.  I can smell his breath over here.  Yes, he's nervous.  He needs to go to the dentist.  He's scared.  Oh, poor Big A.  That's scared.  That's okay, though.  That's the one thing he doesn't like is talking about.  You know something?  Bravo, though, with you. 
[02:51:30]  She's the only...  Well, when you're talking, you shouldn't let it come out, though.  She's the only one with courage enough to hand the guy a fucking mint.  Yeah.  You'll sit there.  In a real sweet way.  Yeah.  Check her clothes out for her.  Here you go.  Yeah.  Half-naked girls hand you a mint.  You take it.  What do you think of the women?  Beautiful.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Very beautiful.  Thank you very much.  Now, I heard a lady said you guys were negotiating behind the scenes, and you don't want Big A  touching you whatsoever, right?  We want to touch each other. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, that's a big deal.  But let's be honest.  You're a little scared of Big A, right?  No, he's not.  We try to be very honest this show.  I think he's sexy.  He's sexy.  In a bizarro world.  On Earth, too.  Andrew's a sexy man.  Yeah.  How sexy would you think he is the second he slaps the lid on that 55-gallon drum before  you end up in his basement collection?  Hey, I was listening to him talk dirty, and my pussy got wet.  It did?  Yeah.  What spilt in your lap?  Because obviously it couldn't have been him talking. 
[02:52:30]  Who was the klutz out there?  The suck it part.  The suck it part?  Suck it.  When he just yelled,  Suck it.  Why don't you say it again?  Suck it.  Suck it.  You just got to wonder how many times that was the last thing somebody heard for the  necklace snap.  It's so good.  Last thing you hear before he pushes play on the Tom Petty Greatest Hit CD. 
[02:53:00]  It's over, Johnny.  Nothing.  All right.  So, ladies.  Nothing.  What are you guys about?  What are we about?  Yeah, you're from L.A.?  I'm from, yes, born and raised Los Angeles.  Yeah, you can have that look.  That's L.A., California girl.  And Steve recruited you guys, right?  Mm-hmm.  I'm a Seymour Butts tushy girl, and this is Selena Silver, my girlfriend.  Your girlfriend?  Yeah.  You've done any features together?  Yes. 
[02:53:30]  Actually, we did War of the Girls by Seymour Butts.  War of the Girls.  I have that one right here.  This one will go home with me.  Oh, look at that.  I was at the premiere.  Were you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a red carpet that led down into a basement.  He slipped on it.  Wait, we're missing some good stuff here.  Shit.  I said I do anal, gaping, squirting, you know.  Now, anal, right?  Gaping is, what, holding various holes open?  Stretching my asshole open.  Stretching your asshole open so you can really see deep.  Yes.  Deep inside flowers, tissue baby.  Let's play basketball. 
[02:54:00]  Some gaping.  Deep inside flowers, tissue baby.  And then double penetration.  I love double penetration.  You like that?  Mm-hmm.  Who doesn't?  Of course.  Really?  And then, uh, wow.  You are, uh, you are taking a lot of cock on the back of this box.  Yes, I take a lot of cock.  Nice.  I'm a cock lover.  Yeah?  Do you really enjoy it, or is it just a job?  I really enjoy it.  You do?  I love what I do.  You always liked the cock?  Of course.  How old were you when you first got the cock? 
[02:54:30]  I did anal when I first had sex, and I was 16.  So, 16.  Before you had vaginal sex, or was it right after?  Most of my girlfriends...  Your first session?  We were trying to, like, wait until we were married and stuff like that.  Yeah, dopey girls.  Yeah.  Hey, we were young, you know?  Yeah.  And my girlfriends told me that it didn't hurt, so I tried it, and it hurt a little, but it  wasn't that bad.  Your girlfriends told you that the ass didn't hurt?  Yeah, they said it wasn't that bad.  Is that a joke girls play on each other?  Yeah, God, it ain't bad. 
[02:55:00]  You can fuck me in the ass.  That's Catholic girls for you.  Yeah, Catholic girls, see?  The Catholic upbringing, very strict.  Naughty.  And you go out...  Dirty girls.  Did you tell Mommy you were going somewhere else?  And then you'd, you know, we're just going to the movies.  Yeah, we're going to the movies.  And you go fuck your boyfriend.  I did a lot of handjobs in the theaters.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  Want some butter with your boyfriend?  Well, I think if you took anal the first time...  Is that it?  You would go to the movie theater and give your boyfriend a handy?  Of course, why not?  That's fantastic.  Whacking off to the greatest films ever made. 
[02:55:30]  Sit in the back and you might be able to get away with a BJ.  Wow.  You are a good egg.  And that's only like $9.50 for a movie?  So you guys want to do...  You just have to pick the right movie where you know it's going to bomb and nobody's showing  up, you know?  Yeah, you don't want to pack theater.  Yeah, you don't want to go to Star Wars.  Excuse me, you mind if I sit here?  Yeah.  Star Wars on opening night.  Yeah, that's not a good one to go with.  You're going to like the last Deuce Bigelow.  Yeah.  Oh, two weeks after it's been out.  One of those movies someone from Friends makes. 
[02:56:00]  That's when Chandler has a movie coming out.  Yeah.  Two weeks in to the release.  That's when you're going.  You could be up on the stage and no one will give a shit.  That's fantastic.  Well, you girls...  So you guys want to do some tricks today?  Fantastic or fabulous.  Fantastic.  And the ass would be...  Yes.  You guys want to do some tricks today?  Some tricks?  I love to do tricks.  Now, who's the squirter?  You're also a squirter.  Yes.  Now, how did you learn that you could do this? 
[02:56:30]  It just happened?  Lots of good sex.  Good sex.  And then did it just surprise you and happen one day?  No.  G-spot stimulation, actually.  And I had a boyfriend that had a nice curved cock.  So just like whenever I come, I just squirt a lot.  So was that the first time with old boomerang dick?  Or did you know beforehand that you could squirt like that?  It was the first time.  First time.  And he knew you were going to do it?  I think I was over 18 when I was doing squirting orgasms. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  But he was prepared for it?  It took me a little while to get there.  He was prepared for it?  He knew that you were going to do this?  Or did he go, what the fuck?  He was surprised.  He was like, what was that?  But he loved it.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then he wanted me to do it all the time.  He'd like get his face in there.  I just did my first movie.  It's called Flower Squirt Shower.  Flower Squirt Shower.  So I spray my love on everyone.  I have that one.  I have flower power.  Yeah, you have flower power.  That sounds like a variety hour special from the early 70s.  It does.  Doesn't it look like that?  George Goldblum's going to host it. 
[02:57:30]  I should come here.  I can do it.  With guest star, Griff Wilson.  Artie Johnson in the bushes.  He's getting squirt.  Well, these girls got to get out of here by 1030.  I'm here.  Oh, damn.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we better get right to the action.  I guess we better do our tricks quick.  Yeah.  And then Big A will be your target.  And you've squirt how far?  I can distance up to 17 feet.  Up to 17 feet.  Is that a Guinness Book of World Record?  It should be.  It should be.  Yeah?  It will be very soon. 
[02:58:00]  You know how you tell.  You look between the dorsal fin and the tail.  So we've got people in this room to have, what, someone standing each foot?  So, yeah.  No, we want the money shot to just be right on Big A's face.  Yeah.  We'll aim it.  I can get the whole table.  Can you actually determine how far you're going to squirt?  I'll squirt far.  Yeah?  Like, if you know you've got to go three feet.  You're going to be showered, Big A.  How about that, huh?  Pretty hot.  I'm not guaranteeing that it's not going to go a little bit that way. 
[02:58:30]  So I'll try my best.  Well, what you're going to do is kind of, you're going to be facing the door.  And Big A is going to be over there.  Yeah.  You might want to swing your mind.  No, we can't be here like we were playing golf and the sprinklers came on.  You know what I mean?  We've got work to do.  Hep C just flying across the studio.  It's really up to you.  They're on the Liberator, Anthony.  You can actually do that where you just come right away, huh? 
[02:59:00]  I need to suck my big candy cock first.  You've got a big candy cock, don't you?  Ooh.  Look at she's sucking on a big candy cock.  We're getting pictures and video.  Yeah, I like to shove things down my throat, but this is pretty big.  That is pretty big.  She's going to deep throat her candy cock a little bit, just gagging.  A little gag.  That'll happen.  What are you going to do?  All right, the other girl is...  Rewind 20 years.  Don't just go off half cocked, half candy cocked.  Let us know, you know, and we'll get Big A in position. 
[02:59:30]  I've now got to get out of here on the console.  Rewind 20 years.  Sweetheart, what do you want to do when you grow up?  I've got to do this.  Yeah, how'd you get into this?  Thank you.  How'd you get into the industry?  It's like pissy warm.  I had a boyfriend who got me into the industry.  We were freaks.  Really?  We wanted to do porn.  Was it old T-square cock or...  It was Kirby cock.  It was Kirby cock?  I was born and raised in L.A., so it was just something I wanted to do. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  It's just the definition of uninhibited.  Big A, when was the last time...  Best of the eater ever.  When was the last time you saw anything like this, huh?  Maybe you mixed it for me.  A while ago?  Yeah.  Big A's kid.  Don't look at me.  Go ahead.  Look at that.  Get all worked up.  Ah, there's spitting going on.  Yeah.  I like that porno where they're just, like, spitting on each other and driving that thing 
[03:00:30]  home.  She's, uh...  Ooh.  Now, the one...  She has the boomerang dildo.  Yeah, the one girl's working the other girl with the dildo.  And then the squirter herself, she's working herself with her hand.  Big A, you better get ready.  Oh, fuck that's so fucking big.  Yeah, little whore.  Big A, kneeled down.  High, cunt, rat boy.  Yeah, you like that pretty little pink pussy, Andrew?  Big A's in front of this flesh howitzer. 
[03:01:00]  I know.  Just waiting.  How far back do you want Big A to go?  Uh, he can actually scoot back a little further.  Back a little further.  Are you sure you squirt that far?  No, I think he's just ruining the mood.  Yeah, that could be.  Yeah, could you scoot back past the door?  No, she's positive.  Yeah.  Big A's about six feet away now.  Is your friend there going to get wet, too?  She probably will.  She likes it, though.  He's sitting, look at his feet, he looks like a bulldog.  Yeah.  He's got his fucking...  He's sitting there. 
[03:01:30]  Knuckles to the inside.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Wait, what's going on?  I'm going to do some good pumps here on my G-spot.  Okay, you do that.  Danny, you got the right angle for the video?  Make sure you're pointed in the right direction.  I think you need to, here, switch places with...  That's why we got a bullseye on Big A.  Yeah, you got to move this way so we can...  And get the mic in there.  Oh, my God.  You want all my fucking time, Andrew?  You want me to come all over you?  One more moment, please.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Wow, it's like he's getting maced.  Let it rip.  There's more.  There's more in there.  Oh, my baby.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy shit.  It's the most violent thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  More?  Shh.  Oh, yeah.  It's like he stabbed a melon.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  How does it feel like to have cum in your eye, Andrew?  You're very good.  Yeah?  Are you as white as I am?  Yes, I am.  Wow.  That's what I want to hear. 
[03:03:00]  Man, did he get a face load.  Oh, the lipstick's running on his face.  The Target lipstick is now running.  I like my own cum because it's really sweet.  That was, I don't know, that was, wasn't that insane?  I have a guy who eats my pussy and I cum in his mouth and then he spits it back into mine.  Of course.  Not hot.  Yeah, Daddy's got to be proud.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  That is amazing.  You can put it up now, Andrew.  I could probably give you a little more, but. 
[03:03:30]  That is the most violent thing I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, you're like stabbing yourself with the dildo and then it comes flying out very violently.  Big A, let's see your face.  Don't wipe it off you.  Let's get a good photo.  Get an up-close picture of his face.  No, get a close-up.  You got it.  I only use phallic's glass, actually.  Yeah.  Oh, is that a...  Because it has no give.  Yeah.  So I use glass toys because it hits the g-spot and you can actually manipulate it better.  Ah.  Oh, that's a trick.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Wow.  I wanted to get a picture.  Yes, get a picture with the big A.  There are many girls out there listening and they want to learn how to squirt.  Flower does instructional videos on it.  Really?  Instructional videos.  Yeah, where is that?  Where can we find the videos?  If you go to selenasool.com, she has a store there with all her videos that she signs and sells.  And there's a custom section there.  This girl is just multi-talented.  Two seconds ago, she's eating pussy.  Yeah.  And now she's just like the ultimate publicist.  Plugging.  Yeah.  She's like, you can go to... 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  A lot of people ask him how...  Big A, you are soaked.  Look at his shirt.  It's unbelievable.  And his pants.  It's not...  He looks about like eight minutes into a treadmill.  Yeah.  Eight for him?  It's not even funny.  It's not even funny how wet Big A is.  Look at her sliding across...  And a lot of people want to know...  This will be the company.  Hello.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, there we go.  A lot of people want to know how far that went.  God bless you.  Big A was about...  Big A was in the way.  Big A was about six feet away, but the blast that hit his face shows that it could have 
[03:05:00]  went at least another, I don't know, six or seven feet.  Yeah, there was a lot of thrust there.  If he wasn't in bulldog stance, I think he would have got blown into the water thrust.  I was trying to see if I hit the door.  Yeah, I think you did.  Oh, yeah.  You had no problem.  Dripping a little.  God, man, we're going to need a cleaning crew after this week of radio.  Yeah.  I just washed your floors.  We're going to need a hazmat team in here.  Yeah, this is so much better than yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That was good.  We got the...  Dry hanging up.  Yesterday was awful.  I saw this tarp online.  Yeah.  Let everybody know that flowered so she squirted all over it. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Big A.  Look at the look Big A is giving her.  Andrew's not.  You were just staring.  Andrew's got girl goo all over him.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How many times has a girl goo all over you?  Do you realize that?  Do you see the look that he's giving you?  Look at her.  He wants to choke you so bad.  He wants to choke the life out of you.  Looks like a happy man.  He actually wants to snap your neck.  Isn't that sick?  I like to be choked.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  You are a freaky bitch. 
[03:06:00]  I like to be snapped, too.  She's slapping her own tits, Opie.  Oh, that's wonderful.  And her pussy.  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that great?  Do you want Big A to slap you a little bit?  Can Big A slap you a little bit?  Maybe spank your ass?  Go ahead.  He can give me some spanking.  Big A, spank her a little bit.  Get a mic on Big A.  And Big A, we want you to talk to him as you're doing it.  Get a mic on Big A.  Big A.  Yeah, we still have some lines left over.  I didn't mean to kill her.  Go ahead.  Yep, go ahead.  I had her.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  You like that, Big A. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  I'm so jealous.  How long before he snaps?  Oh.  His childhood rage comes out.  You're a machine, dude.  Yeah.  I'm going to give her the Caligula fist.  Head on.  That's it, Big A?  Yeah, you like that, huh?  Yeah.  What did you think?  I wouldn't.  It was pretty lame.  Baby.  It was lame, right?  I'm shaking my ass.  What about this gaping thing, man?  You like gaping?  Yeah, what's up with the gaping?  I don't like it.  You just stretch your asshole a little bit.  And it just opens up like, oh. 
[03:07:00]  Can we throw stuff in it?  I got a little gape.  A little gape.  I got fucked in my ass last night.  Oh, you did?  Hmm.  Yeah.  See, you can just pull it open.  Wow.  I can stick my finger in my butt, and then I'll suck on it.  Oh, wow.  I miss everything back here.  I can eat out of my ass.  It's so clean.  You can eat out of it?  Oh, well, if you could.  I can stick a Popsicle up there and suck on it afterwards. 
[03:07:30]  You've done that, huh?  Mm-hmm.  It's got to be cold.  Can you stick that glass dildo up your ass?  You get some sort of a headache when you do that?  I just had Lexington stealing my ass on Saturday.  I'm sure I could take this, no problem.  You could stick that.  Wow, she shoves that right up her ass.  Let's see how far it'll go.  There it goes.  It just disappeared, huh?  Just like that.  It's like nothing.  Can't guarantee any gaping right now, though.  No, well, it made a pop noise on the way out.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:08:00]  You are a good girl.  Yes, I am.  You've come in here and just not been shy or anything.  Of course not.  I assume the gaping thing seems like a good idea when you're young,  but aren't you worried about getting older and all of a sudden the asshole falls out?  Yeah, exactly.  Actually, I believe that if you use your muscles and your body,  like your anal muscles and your vaginal muscles,  it'll make it stronger.  Oh, so it'll be stronger and like...  Yeah, if you don't use those muscles,  then you just have a hole that people fall into. 
[03:08:30]  See, I have like a lot of muscles in my pussy.  Like when I push,  like they actually come,  like they'll come out.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I would recommend that 86-year-olds out there go and start gaping.  Yeah, but they could squirt.  What do they have to lose, though, at that point?  Might as well pick up a new hobby at 86.  Hey, they say a butt plug a day,  a butt plug for an hour a day takes the stress away.  For men and women.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  Why don't you watch television?  No, I think a butt plug a day for an, for what, an hour a day? 
[03:09:00]  An hour a day takes the stress away.  I think that's 23 hours of stress  thinking about getting a butt plug.  Have you tried it?  I think I'm going to stick with the stress.  Yeah.  You can get the small one.  I'm going to stick with the high blood pressure.  Oh, yeah, different sizes.  Yeah, you can get the small one,  and then you can work your way up.  You're just not willing to change.  You're right.  I have a huge butt plug.  Do they have one called the Lil Butt Plugs?  Spell like that, L-I-L.  Well, if they don't,  then I'm going to have to come up with one. 
[03:09:30]  Also known as Daddy's Disappointment.  They can have like a thumb.  Do like a thumb one.  That's the answer.  A thumb?  No, no.  No thumb.  You don't even like a little tongue?  You don't like your salad toss?  No.  No.  You don't shave your butthole, do you?  The only thing...  No, no, no.  It's not.  The only thing I like down there  is a Charmin  and then a little aloe wipe  right afterwards.  I like the bidets.  Yeah, well, 
[03:10:00]  not everybody has one.  I like to turn them on full blast  and have them go right up my ass.  You like fight the bidet stream.  You could have a battle with it  and see who could...  You probably...  Like squirting and keeping it down.  Exactly.  Like two wizards going at it.  I have a friend  who has a shower attachment  that's a dildo.  You put it on your shower head  and you just stick it up your ass  and it goes...  That must be like  great when company comes over.  You've got to hide  the dildo shower head.  Yeah, who's mopping up over there?  Who's on the...  Oh, well, of course.  Bill the intern. 
[03:10:30]  Hey, how much better was today  as opposed to yesterday?  A lot better.  Yeah, a lot better.  Would you have taken  the blast in the face, Bill,  the intern?  Potentially.  Potentially.  Yeah.  You'll smell a homeless girl's ass  but you won't take...  Once you try...  I would much rather do that  than smell that awful person's ass again.  Yeah.  We had a homeless woman  in here yesterday  and she got naked  and pulled her butt cheeks apart  and he got his nose  an inch from it  and inhaled deeply  and almost...  Oh, goodness.  ...almost dropped dead.  Hope she froze to death overnight. 
[03:11:00]  I'm going to pay you after that.  This thing is that  that wasn't a joke.  No, no, he really means that.  This just in,  Jimmy Norton has jumped  from the Hollywood sign.  None of you guys  have been with a girl  that squirts  when you have sex with her?  No.  No?  Oh, my God.  You guys are missing out.  Yeah, I guess we are.  What's wrong with these women?  I think that would be  a surprise  that would be  a little odd.  Like, I can't...  You warn people before?  Yeah, do you?  Do you?  That's a good question.  Well, I mean,  everybody pretty much knows,  I guess, 
[03:11:30]  but, like,  and I don't...  I don't know.  I mean, most civilians...  It's like your bed.  Most civilians, like...  Is your bed just a mess?  They're into it.  Like, most people  are really into it.  Or the guy's bed,  doesn't that become a mess, or...  It gets wet,  but it dries very fast.  Yeah, but then it's,  you know...  And it's odorless.  It's just the first time  you see it.  It's odorless.  I mean, when you come  on your bed,  do you, like,  freak out  and, like,  go wash it, like,  right away?  You probably have  a billion comb stains  I would probably  be concerned. 
[03:12:00]  If I came as much  as you just did...  I have guys that  they want me to  because then they  want to sleep in it later  and they want to  smell my juices.  Wow.  All right.  I could always go  off the edge of the bed  and just come on,  you know,  off the side.  A lamp on the carpet.  Or I can hit your curtains.  Like a lamp  or some knick-knack  or maybe you went  to Cape Cod  and you got a little  lobster mask.  I have.  In fact,  I did a competition  where I got the squirt  on flowers  and then when it got  wet enough,  they popped up.  Oh.  Yeah.  And then we did one  where we made  an electricity run.  For some reason,  I don't believe that.  With what? 
[03:12:30]  With the water  that goes through  the machine  and then they have  you squirt on it.  Yeah,  they have you squirt  on it  and then it goes around  and then it turns  the light bulb on.  Even the water wheel  is being used  for pornography  these days.  Isn't that amazing?  I love it.  Well,  that's something.  You ever hit  a radiator  and just go steaming?  Actually,  I was doing a movie  called Pussy Party  for Cousin Stevie.  Pussy Party,  yeah.  Number six,  I believe.  And the girls  were using a magic wand  on me  and I was in doggy  and I squirted  all over it  and I got electrocuted. 
[03:13:00]  Wow,  you felt a shock?  I got electrocuted  like twice  and I had to pull  it out of the wall.  Wow.  That's terrific.  Hey,  nothing like  building alive.  Yeah.  Well,  you are something else.  You guys want to  finish with anything?  That's true original.  Well,  I recommend  if women want to  learn how to squirt,  I recommend  getting a pocket rocket  and using it  on your clit.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then also  go to my site  flowerstushy.net  and go to  slingsilver.com.  Flower Tushy,  T-U-C-C-C-I,  Okay.  .net  and slingsilver.com 
[03:13:30]  and you can also  buy my autograph  movies on her site too.  She didn't already  tell you that.  Are all the autographs  smudged?  No.  You could just picture  it.  And I even  personalize it  by each order.  And how do you  personalize it?  With your name  and I say  cram it deep up my ass  because she wants  your hard cock.  God bless.  Best wishes.  Mazel tov.  Well,  that's fantastic.  I love sex.  It's all sex.  Got your movies.  Yeah,  this was  I'm trisexual. 
[03:14:00]  I'll try anything.  Really?  I'm on a seafood diet.  I say food  and I eat it.  I don't have a good imagination.  Anything that's a willing partner  or something.  In a sense.  Doesn't matter.  You'll try it.  The slow clap.  The 80s.  Yeah,  you go girl.  Thank you.  Thank you for letting me  come on your show.  No worries.  Oh,  come on the show.

I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great. 
[03:16:30]  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time,  so I didn't tell you sooner  because I was too scared to,  but now I got a different job,  but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  You, hold on. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, like, three days to get out of here,  so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah,  but I kind of had to use some of it  to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where can I call you? 
[03:17:30]  The same number,  but, Mom?  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know  that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things  are so funny  when they happen to other people.  I mean,  I would sit and listen to them  all day long  because they're so funny,  but that...  You killed me. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really nice people.  Okay, I am going to kill you.  Wait, wait, wait, Mom.  Mom, first kill us.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We put her up to it,  and I got to admit, man,  my heart sunk to my damn knee.  Oh, my God.  I felt so bad for you.  I'm breaking out in a sweat here.  I'm thinking that it's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  All right.  The very worst  of the Opie and Anthony

Hey, this is Wall.  I want to give a big  fuck you to FEMA  who won't process  my application  until I can come up  with an old utility bill.

We want to say thank you  actually to Plower,  Tushy,  T-U,  C-C-I, 
[03:20:30]  and Selena Silver  for that little act  they just performed  on that website  when I go home.  That was amazing.  You're calling it amazing?  Yes, amazing.  Like anything else,  like seeing a high-wire  act at a circus.  Amazing.  It was disturbing.  Yeah.  It was going into her  and into her mouth.  That's disgusting.  It was very violent.  Ah, the old familiar  smell of Lysol.  Eric.  Something horrific happened.  Eric from Jersey  has a little problem.  And Eric from Jersey 
[03:21:00]  is an ass.  Why aren't you asking  them why it's fake?  Which it absolutely is.  I thought you guys  weren't so gullible.  Ask her to do it again.  I'll bet you $1,000  she can't  because it was piss.  All capital,  a thousand exclamation  points after that.  Couple of posts up.  It was piss.  Don't be so stupid.  Again, caps,  all exclamation points.  And again,  two posts up.  It was piss.  Even porn message boards  have discussed this topic.  Oh, the doctors  at the porn message boards  have discussed this topic 
[03:21:30]  with video porn directors  telling the secret.  Dude,  if you knew anything  about anything  and if you were here  watching,  we've seen girls piss  and we've seen girls  do this.  It's different.  It's absolutely different.  And the place  doesn't smell like piss.  It would smell like piss.  Yeah,  wouldn't it smell like piss?  And it would come out  like piss.  It wasn't.  Eric from Jersey. 
[03:22:00]  Eric from Jersey.  Let's see.  It just says  W-R-T  at A-O-L dot net  as his email address.  Maybe you can enlighten him  with some literature.  Hey,  Rocco.  Yeah.  Oregon,  what's up?  Hey,  not much.  Am I on the air?  Yeah,  go ahead.  My girlfriend's  a squirt  and it is  the greatest thing  ever.  She just squirt  on me last night  and it tastes  sweet as honey.  Oh,  it's piss.  Oh,  God. 
[03:22:30]  That tastes  sweet as honey.  And it's not  pissed either,  I guarantee it.  All right,  thank you.  A lot of people  were very excited  by that last segment.  Sounds like his face  is already glazed.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  Jason.  Sweet as honey.  Ugh.  Jason.  Yeah,  I just want to say  good job,  guys.  You guys had me  fucking laughing  for the fucking  past half hour.  First of that  fucking blind hole  and now fucking  Big Game  laughing in the  fucking face.  That girl was  very nice.  Yeah,  we like Chris  to the blind girl. 
[03:23:00]  All right,  thank you.  I see Black Earl  is here.  He's got a big show  this weekend  on 202,  the Black Rock Coalition.  We'll be on for  two hours  tomorrow night  at midnight.  Tomorrow evening.  Rhythm Nation gear  as always.  That's why he's  Black Earl.  Dresses all in black  every day.  Same thing.  Where's our  cartoon character?  We need our  Denzel at like  the premiere  to like Malcolm X  in like 1992.  Right.  Where's Elo?  Elo's here?  Stop it.  No, 
[03:23:30]  we need him  on the phone.  We got to announce  the arch enemy today.  A lot of people  are beyond pissed.  Why don't we  just announce it?  I think  because someone's  job is at stake.  Who's?  I think I figured  it out.  What?  I figured it out.  Tell me.  It's Anthony's cook.  I think.  It's not  a douchebag.  Well,  this guy has  signed his contract  and he's going  to be joining  XM.  Yeah.  But I think  there may be  a little shuffling  that might happen  down in D.C. 
[03:24:00]  and that's why  we can't announce  it yet.  Oh,  I got it.  Someone's being  replaced.  That's what  I'm thinking.  And  the head  has to roll  or is the head  going to roll  or is the head  just going to end up  in another department?  I don't know  but we have to  announce it,  Eric.  We're starting  to look stupid  now.  Where's Elo?  Well,  Monday will come  around soon enough,  right?  Oh my God,  they'll kill us.  You have no idea  what these guys  are capable of.  I think they're  very patient.  They're very patient 
[03:24:30]  people.  These pests  are capable of things.  They are.  I met him at shows  a very nice one.  Not hostile at all.  Patient.  What's up,  Ben?  He's in a meeting  with Hugh.  Oh boy.  No,  he's not.  We're right here.  You don't want  to do that whole thing?  Abbott and Costello?  He's meeting with Hugh.  No.  Opie's right there.  First base.  So that would be  one of your type  of jokes there,  Ben.  Ben likes those jokes.  All right, 
[03:25:00]  Dangerous Toys.  The list is out  for this holiday season.  And we got  the audio.  Yes,  we do.  Very important  for the parents  out there.  Danger.  Listen closely.  This holiday season,  your kids will use  everything from crayons  to emails to write  out their wish lists.  But before you shop,  you should check that  against the watch list,  an annual list of toys  that could be hazardous  to your children.  This fist  is sold  for clobbering time. 
[03:25:30]  Seems every year  there's no shortage  of dangerous toys  to make lists  like this one.  As a parent of three,  I would like to know  that when we go  into the toy stores  this year,  the toys that we select  are safe for our children.  These ten are just  a small sample  of the trouble  lurking on shelves  this holiday season,  most of them  choking hazards.  Even after all these years  of talking about  these same hazards,  we're finding them  on the shelf.  On the package,  by the way,  it says,  caution,  do not aim  at eyes or face. 
[03:26:00]  And this is a product  sold for children,  a toy, supposedly.  The group Watch,  or World Against Toys  Causing Harm,  makes a clever name,  but this group  is powerful, too.  Year after year,  toys on this list  are off the shelves  by the next holiday season.  There are plenty  of things we can't  protect our children from,  and why not be  a little bit more  conscious about  the toys we buy?  And you can check out  the entire list  of dangerous toys  on this website,  toysafety.org.  I like the one 
[03:26:30]  they're having  a problem with this year.  It's called  Tweezers and Outlet.  It's a great toy  for the kids,  ages three and up.  I did that  when I was a kid.  You did that one?  Yeah.  Grabbed the tweezers  and shoved it  in an outlet.  But luckily,  I was holding  the tweezers  behind where they met,  so it shorted out  through the tweezers  and made a big spark.  But if I was  holding them up,  then there would  have been a problem.  I did that.  But the toys  we used to play  with as kids  would never even 
[03:27:00]  make the shells  these days.  I mean,  remember something  that was called  Incredible Edibles?  It was an oven.  You got pretty much  a forge,  a foundry,  and it came  with this metal mold.  And you would put  this plastic goop,  they called it.  Just goop.  It didn't need  an ingredient list on it.  It was just called goop.  Lead mold.  And you poured in,  you got a lead mold.  And then you'd use  these tongs  to put it in this oven 
[03:27:30]  and let it cook  for a while.  Then the same tongs  would,  and they're spring-loaded  tongs that fit  in these precariously  small little holes  and everything.  You pull this now  metal mold out  and it's red hot.  This is a toy  for children.  This red hot  branding iron  full of goop.  Steel worker.  Yeah,  that's pretty much  what you're doing.  Sparks are flying out.  You wait for it  to cool,  which took like hours,  and then you'd  peel this thing out 
[03:28:00]  that was made of goop  and you'd play with it  because now it's  a little spider  or a bug  or something like that.  And then,  of course,  hence the name  Incredible Edibles.  It's not only incredible,  it's edible.  And you would eat it.  You could eat  this fucking thing  and God knows  what type of  DuPont chemical  mixture  this thing  was made out of.  Not to mention  the fact that you're  baking it in a lead tray.  Yeah,  the tray that it was  made out of was lead.  So you're pouring  this mixture  that you're eating  in this lead tray. 
[03:28:30]  Just one example,  another,  click clacks  were great.  How about  lawn darts?  Lawn darts  were always a good one.  Click clacks were,  like they use it  as a weapon  in Australia  or something.  It's a weapon.  What is it?  A bolo?  South America.  Something they call  the slingshot.  They'd sell them to kids  and it was a toy.  It's a fucking toy.  Bow and arrows  they would sell?  Yeah.  Yeah,  bow and arrow.  The kid across the street  used to play this game.  He was older than us.  We'd go out  in like this field area  and he would just 
[03:29:00]  shoot the thing  up in the air  in our general direction  and we'd like  almost looking at  like a pop fly  and you'd have to  try to run out of the way.  Yeah,  get out of the way.  Cars driving by,  no one stopped us.  Yeah,  this is a newer version  and they all now  the same stuff  comes from China  and Taiwan  and I guess  they get here  on ships with refugees  and put them out  but it's called  Fun and Games  Fantastic Plastic Bubbles.  This used to be called  Super Elastic Bubble Plastic  and what it is  is this little tube 
[03:29:30]  of plastic material  on the end of a straw.  You'd gum it up  on the end  and blow into it  and make these huge balls  of plastic.  It's like a  half balloon,  half bubble.  The thing is  you would  breathe in.  If,  God forbid,  there's never any  valves on these straws,  you accidentally  re-inhaled  what you would put  in the balloon,  this toxic mixture  would mix  with what you blew in,  the air you blew in  and go into your lungs  and it was, 
[03:30:00]  you might as well  just wrap your mouth  around an exhaust pipe  of a car.  It was that toxic.  You'd get dizzy  and pass out  and faint  and they'd have  to put these  warning labels on  and then eventually  they'd just disappear.  But there were,  the toys,  every single toy  was fucking dangerous.  Just a hazard.  Remember that?  That Star Trek  disc shooting gun?  Oh yeah.  All the disc shooters.  Every kid had that.  Those things rock.  And those little discs  could slit your eyeball.  They were sharp  and the choking hazard 
[03:30:30]  for that fucking thing.  I like when they say  on the audio,  they say that,  you know,  they're identifying  these toys  and they'll be off  the shelf next year.  Next year.  Yeah.  They'll be on the shelf  this year.  Yeah.  They'll be a hazard  this year.  And next year,  what happened last year?  Yeah,  next year we'll take care of it.  There'll be new toys  next year  that'll take the place.  Let's say hi to Rod  in Tennessee.  Rod.  I had a wood burner.  How about the wood burner?  That was a real safe one.  I can't remember that.  Yeah,  what was that,  for engraving or something?  Yeah.  Yeah,  engraving in wood. 
[03:31:00]  You can write your name,  but it'd get like  350 degrees on the ship.  And plugged into the wall  with like a four-foot cord.  And the problem  with a lot of these toys  is they didn't give you  enough stuff  so then you would use it  for something else.  Now you're engraving  your initials  in the wall  in your room,  on your brother's ass,  whatever's around.  You don't care.  There was also,  the guy online too  has one of the most  dangerous things  that were given  to children.  Mitch,  what do you got?  How about the chemistry set 
[03:31:30]  with the nice  Bunsen burner?  Yeah,  chemistry set  or the lead.  The lead,  I guess soldiers.  You would make  lead soldiers.  They'd give you a mold,  give you lead,  and a little thing  on the end of a stick,  a cauldron,  and you'd put it  in a fire  and melt lead.  And the toy,  if you really break  this thing down,  you're giving your child  molten lead 
[03:32:00]  as a toy  to just  pour into molds.  Well,  this was before  VCRs and all that shit.  Right.  You had to keep  occupied.  No video games.  Give them like an  x-ray machine  and like a noose.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah,  there you go.  See your own  foot bones.  All right,  it's an x-ray machine.  I've been doing this  all day.  They always had fun  for hours.  Preoccupy those  little monsters.  All right,  well.  Oh,  that was good,  too.  Yeah,  the Johnny 07 gun 
[03:32:30]  with the plastic bullets  that Scott is bringing  up on the phone.  You dump a bunch  of these yellow  plastic BBs  into this gun.  It was almost  a BB gun.  It was plastic BBs,  so you figure,  ah,  it can't be that dangerous.  But again,  your eyeball right out,  and as far as choking  goes,  forget about it.  And the pumps that,  the more you pumped it,  the harder the shot got.  Yeah.  You pump it for like an hour.  Pump.  And you can put a hole  through like,  you can do some damage.  Mm-hmm.  All right,  we're running out of show. 
[03:33:00]  We want to see  if Black Earl's ready  for the Black Rock Coalition.  Earl.  Earl ready?  We're going to start  doing some crazy things  on the weekends  here on 202.  We're starting with Earl.  He's had this dream  for many, many years.  He's doing the Black Rock  Coalition live  tomorrow night at midnight,  East Coast time,  right here on 202.  Are you ready for it, Earl?  Yeah.  I haven't really,  I'm still kind of  in Ron and Fez mode,  but I am very much  in Ron and Fez mode,  but once...  You better be.  Ron A.  Hey, Ron.  Here comes Ron.  So a lot of Black artists, 
[03:33:30]  interviews,  phone calls.  What's the plan?  All of the above.  None of the above.  All of the above.  Something of the above.  Now,  I don't want him  shirking his responsibilities  on your show, Ron.  He's been gone.  Ever since you guys  gave him this opportunity,  I got one man down.  Fez Watley  is out,  which, Opie,  I really don't blame you for.  I don't know where Fez's head...  Oh, the heart attack thing?  Where's that audio?  I don't know where Fez's head  is with that, but...  So...  Fez's got a long list, yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Now,  Earl's head's in the stars.  He's got no time for me.  I...  My thoughts,  my brain is on the show.  Yeah,  just like our own Jimmy Norton.  Let's use him as an example.  Doing our show,  Third Mike,  and then all of a sudden  this HBO thing comes up.  Right.  And it's like,  no, guys,  I'm still with you.  I'm still there.  And did we get one call  from Jimmy Norton all week?  We haven't heard from him  in two weeks.  Not a phone call  or nothing  from Lil' Jimmy.  He's out there 
[03:34:30]  doing his own thing.  Earl's here,  but he's doing his own thing.  He knows this is great.  You know,  I'm trying to just  bounce off somebody  off the show  and I'll ask him a question.  He'll be like,  what about the Moonglows?  Do you think they were rock?  I don't know, Earl.  I don't know any of that.  The guy's co-pilot is down.  Yeah.  You know,  that's it.  I should have got  one of those apprentice idiots  from last night  just to come in  and help out.  How are things going  with the program  with a man out?  Oh,  it's a nightmare.  I've been listening.  Absolutely a nightmare.  You know,  I used to think  that Fez depended on me. 
[03:35:00]  No.  Now I figured out the truth.  It's a balancing act.  I need him there  all the time.  It's a seesaw.  Yeah.  I've heard the shows  and you're doing  a great job.  Thank you.  That's what you say,  but...  No, no.  I'm just saying  some of the people  now that you are  forced to deal with  on the program  because Fez isn't here,  I don't know  how you do it.  Yeah.  You know,  I'm talking to Bobby,  the intern,  about Plane Gate.  It's not going  to really happen.  Those broads  you brought on.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  That's Elo's friends. 
[03:35:30]  Well, actually,  they were booked  to do the show.  Fez actually used  to do a show  with them.  I heard one of the  most disgusting things  I've ever heard  out of a woman's mouth  on that show.  What was that?  When you were talking  about how Opie and Anthony  were walking out  of the office  and they saw us come in  and she was asking  questions about Opie  and said that we only  date girls that are  their daughter's age  and she goes,  old chicken makes  good soup.  Yeah, I didn't know.  Out of every disgusting  thing I've ever heard 
[03:36:00]  in my broadcasting career,  that hit a nerve  that was so putrid.  Right.  Old chicken makes  great soup.  But the weird thing  is...  It doesn't even  make sense.  No.  And it's rude.  In 87,  we'd have banged  all of them.  And it's now like,  our point is,  we're still okay,  but they're not.  That's the blackened.  You know what I mean?  We're taking those  parachute pants off  of them.  Sure.  Z-Cavaricis  right down to the floor.  Capizios off their feet. 
[03:36:30]  That's the sad thing  about life.  Take our jellies off  and suck those toes.  Anthony,  we've got to get  this Jägermeister read-in  before we get out of here  for the weekend.

I lost a lot of innocence  this week.  You did?  You're coming to the dark side.  I feel it.  Every time I come in here  and I walk out,  I feel a little bit of me.  You feel a little bit of you.  You leave a little bit 
[03:38:00]  of your innocence here.  We have another piece  of your soul.  I love it.  He's falling into the dark side  and it's making me feel  a little better about myself.  And he's got a big gig  at Rascal's  at Montclair, New Jersey  next week.  Friday and Saturday  after Thanksgiving.  Yeah, I've got all the info  up on MySpace  and BillBurr.com.  I'm also on that  Friday night  that Greg Geraldo show tonight.  Okay.  On Comedy Central.  Yeah,  where we basically  yelled at each other  for five minutes.  Yeah, I want to see that.  Uncomfortable moments.  You'll be back soon.  I'm hearing rumors 
[03:38:30]  that the Norton,  the HBO show,  the Louis C.K. show,  has already been picked up  for a second season.  Yeah, it's also  we're never seeing Jimmy.  It's over with Jimmy.  Jimmy's gone.  Bill,  we really love you.  Oh God,  I've got to get up  at 6 a.m. every day.  We love Bill Burr.  And then Ronnie,  what,  you need Patrice or anything?  No.  You want one of our guys?  Just sit here  and yell at Earl  for four hours.  Is that what it's going to be?  Yeah.  All right.  Ron and Trice.  Yeah, Ron and Trice.  I like it.  Earl is going to be  doing a show for us  on 202 tomorrow night 
[03:39:00]  at midnight,  the Black Rock Coalition,  midnight to two.  And then next weekend  we're going to have  somebody else do  something stupid  on this channel  on the weekend.  Someone else do  something stupid?  Are you implying that  what Earl is doing  is going to be stupid?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'm actually going to say  if you listen to it  with an open mind,  there's going to be  a couple of gems in there.  Absolutely.  Big A.  Big A.  He's jumping up and down.  Big A,  what's up?  I want to wish 
[03:39:30]  my friend Denise  a happy birthday.  Huh?  Tomorrow's her birthday  and I want to wish  her a happy birthday.  Very good.  I want to wish  her a happy birthday.  All right.  Piss face.  Very good.  By the way.  You wear a dress.  Is there something  with a dress?  Yeah.  Kev, quickly,  where are you going to be?  I'm going to be at  the National Comic Book  and Sci-Fi Expo  today and tomorrow,  Penn Plaza Pavilion  right across from  Madison Square.  Let's see.  Big Kev down there  with the geeks.  Who's the big star 
[03:40:00]  down there?  Carrie Fisher.  Carrie Fisher.  That is a biggie.  Hey.  Is she wearing  the suit?  I hope not.  Carrie Fisher.  That's huge though  for one of those  sci-fi conventions.  It sure is, Anthony.  Could I have your  autograph?  Are you going to be  doing audio?  Interviews?  I'm going to try,  but he might do  interviews for our show.  Give it a whirl.  Make sure you always  work so well.  Black Girls Weekend  and call the FU line  in comments.  We have some good  audio on Monday.  And support Ron  as he doesn't have 
[03:40:30]  to spend the Ron  show now.  Anthony?  Yeah.  SK.  See you on Monday.  Jokey and Anthony.  Program complete.  Two.  I love you.  I'm going to call you  the Harrison.  I'm going to be  cross- kier.  I'm going to tour  there in the  afternoon.  Happy industries.  I'm going to  nurses. </pre>
