<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous skit, the "wheeling of the chairs," featuring Sal's formal, over-the-top speech about the "fat fuck chair."  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion of the 9/11 Memorial Museum's new exhibits, reacting strongly to the displayed artifacts and expressing vehement anger and contempt towards 9/11 conspiracy theorists, using offensive language to dismiss their claims.  A heated, expletive-filled call from "Hansie" in Toronto ensued, with Hansie accusing the hosts of being involved in a cover-up and claiming a friendship with Howard Stern, which they denied.  Hansie defended his conspiracy theories, including the notion that the government orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext for invading Iraq, while the hosts continued to insult and mock him.

The show moved on to the Donald Sterling scandal, playing audio clips of Sterling's racist and misogynistic comments and an interview with "Maserati," who corroborated Sterling's preferences and discussed his involvement with Sterling through an escort service.  The hosts speculated on Maserati's motivations.  The Donald Sterling discussion continued in the next segment, with in-studio guests Rich Voss and Keith Robinson.  This segment also covered multiple other news stories: a BBC Radio DJ fired for playing a song with a racial slur (audio clips were played); Shutterfly's apology for a mass email wrongly congratulating users on baby births; a school's apology for showing a pro-gay marriage video; the Jay-Z elevator fight video leak and the subsequent firing of the hotel employee; and a teen kicked out of prom for her attire and dancing.  Rich Voss discussed his new tattoos, including covering up a Star of David, which led to further offensive banter.

The focus then shifted to Keith Robinson's upcoming stand-up shows at the Gramercy Theater.  Arlie Ermey joined as a guest, discussing his career, including anecdotes about Stanley Kubrick and Chevy Chase, his show *Saving Private K-9*, and his views on gun control and veterans' treatment.  Kevin Hart called in, supporting Robinson's show.  The conversation frequently veered off-topic, including discussions of Rich Voss and his partner's sex life, Bonnie (an ordained minister), Bobby (a media mogul), and a crude anecdote involving one of the hosts and Bonnie.

A later segment heavily featured Keith Robinson's upcoming "Back of the Bus Special," with Kevin Hart again calling in.  Hart discussed his weight loss, his Twitter feud with Mike Epps, and his career.  The conversation included insults directed at Rich Voss, discussions of the Donald Sterling controversy, the 9/11 Memorial Museum dedication (mentioning Obama's attendance), and a bizarre call about a blow-up doll.  The show concluded with insults aimed at Sandy Kane, a guest scheduled for the following day, who had requested $1000 for her appearance.  Throughout the entire broadcast,  the hosts, guests, and callers frequently used profanity, offensive, homophobic, and racist language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, behold the rolling of the chairs, the pomp, the circumstance, 
[00:00:30]  steeped in tradition for hundreds of years.  To bear witness to this is a privilege.  People will be telling their grandchildren about such an event.  There, there it is. There it is. Do you see it? Do you see it?  I do. I do see it.  Working its way up the royal hallway.  It's, I believe that's Opie's chair. 
[00:01:00]  Yes, it is.  Let me check my program.  Yes, yes, it is indeed Opie's chair.  I have a view of it.  If I may take this moment to just take some photographs of this moment.  My word.  This is fantastic.  You know, the guard of the chair that we see, only the greatest of former interns are allowed to wheel the chair. 
[00:01:30]  Somebody looks very confused in the hallway of this whole thing.  Oh, Sal is dressing the part today.  All dressed up.  As well he should be.  It's got a tie on.  You know, we're used to such somber events in this day and age, but...  Opie, it's coming right behind me. 
[00:02:00]  How are you going to get the fat fuck chair out?  There's a chair traffic jam over here.  Oh, is this fantastic?  Nice.  There it is.  Oh, wonderful.  As Opie takes his place and there it goes, the fat fuck chair is leaving. 
[00:02:30]  There goes the fat fuck chair.  Wait, he prepared something.  I prepared a speech, gentlemen.  The Sal is very dressed up.  Hear ye, hear ye.  We are gathered here today, the fifth month, 2,000 years, 14 after death.  Doth thinketh whence a fulsome man sat upon your majesty's throne. 
[00:03:00]  He shan't be named, except thee fat fuck.  Plump in thy buttock, ye breakin' dear throne.  Fumes of assin' seep whence passin'.  Alas, a swain, wicklin' by name.  To please three kings, brought forth a sling.  Majestic, proud, and stout.  With wizards gone, a veil drawn. 
[00:03:30]  Henceforth today, we make merry, a new dignitary.  The wheeling of the chairs.  My word.  That speech has gone unchanged for 400 years.  It's magnificent to witness.  Throw that piece of shit chair out the window.  I was getting uncomfortable for a second.  How were you?  You thought you were supposed to.  I thought he did a good job.  I do too.  I was getting a little scared. 
[00:04:00]  One line too many, and I was going to smash that laptop into his face.  The punching of the jaw.  It's the bashing of the...  The wheeling of the chairs.  There it goes.  There it goes, down the hall.  The fat fuck chair.  Not so much respect with the fat fuck chair going down the hallway.  He's pretty much just kicking it down the hall.  It took him at least three minutes from our office to here.  And some people from other shows were walking past like, what the fuck is going on? 
[00:04:30]  And they roll their eyes.  I know.  What the fuck are you doing with your show today?  Relax.  Lighten up, Francis.  We're just having a good time over here.  When that person walked past, asked what Sal was doing.  He goes, silence.  It's the wheeling of the chairs.  And she goes, oh yeah, because that's important.  Oh, wow.  It's very important.  It certainly is.  For another day or two until we're sick of this.  Well, exactly.  And then we'll move on.  Until that horse is fucking laying there with blood stains. 
[00:05:00]  Right, exactly.  Rotting flesh.  Seems a bit unnecessary.  Just to put a new chair in.  Just a bit.  He's all dressed up, too.  I know.  Yeah, I like that.  He looks hot.  Sal's dressed like he's going to a wedding or something.  Yes, he really did guss me up.  I wish he was in Game of Thrones.  Those never work out well.  No, they're never fun.  No.  Sam's got his hair all pulled back.  Yeah, look at that.  Looking like Walona.  I love him.  Walona. 
[00:05:30]  You got to conk that shit, yo.  Yes.  He's knocking with a hammer.  Opie, now the chair.  Are you liking that chair?  Well, I don't like the attention, to be honest with you.  I don't like when, you know.  You tend to shy away from it.  After all.  I don't like all the attention focused on me like that.  Right, right.  It's a little awkward, to be honest with you.  I got you.  I just kind of want to share in the studio with this joint.  It's George Brett's birthday.  I mentioned that because we get to play the shit story again today. 
[00:06:00]  I love the shit story.  Every chance we get to play the George Brett shit story, I'm in.  He sure spins a great shit yarn.  He's the best at it.  61 today for George Brett.  And we'll play that shit story probably going into the first break.  So, there you have it.  Stay tuned.  I'll tell you.  Got in today.  There's so much going on.  But, man, the papers, I'm sure your paper as well, has pictures of the 9-11 Museum. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  Yeah, some pictures of the exhibits that are down there.  Wow comes to mind.  Sad comes to mind.  Shocking comes to mind.  How about pissed?  Pissed, of course.  I'm still fucking pissed.  Of course.  Of course pissed.  There's one shot in here.  I guess there's a store down the street where they put up a makeshift kind of pictures to searching for people.  And it has the clothes kind of hung on their original racks.  And all of the pants and the shirts are covered in soot from the collapse. 
[00:07:00]  It's really chilling.  And the whole display hasn't been touched since 9-11.  It pretty much looks like any clothing store where you got, you know, shelves of jeans and then you got the shirts hanging in the background.  Yeah.  There's a sale sign even that says $29.99.  And they're just filled with soot and dust like Jimmy said.  I think some dummy will go in there and try on a shirt.  Can I buy this?  Yeah, these are for sale.  It's a fucking exhibit, you idiot.  These pictures are brutal. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  If you haven't seen the airplane window, that conjures up some fucking images, huh?  Kind of a cheap plug, but I did tweet it if you want to check it out.  But wow, it's intense.  You got the George Bush bullhorn down there at the museum.  Oh, is that what that picture's from?  Okay.  You got, Ant was pointing out right before we went live, there's a rotary phone.  Yeah, it's like the, not a rotary phone.  Not a rotary phone.  It's a push button phone.  It's very old looking.  And there's also a Rolodex next to it. 
[00:08:00]  Rolodex, pair of scissors.  So much dust.  But it's like, God, you don't realize, you know, how much time has passed from then till now that there's fucking Rolodex anymore.  Back then, what did we have in 2001?  It wasn't the smartphones yet, but it was really a Palm Pilot kind of a thing.  And they were, no one really had the smartphone down yet.  It was too many things to carry at one time.  If you had a Palm Pilot and a phone and an iPod, they hadn't consolidated everything yet. 
[00:08:30]  So, you know, for phones, you'd still have a Rolodex on your desk.  But you realize how much time has gone by looking at some of these exhibits.  It also captures, and I think that's what gets the emotions, is it captures that fucking moment.  You know, it's like you look at a helmet, a fucking fire helmet that's just bent up and smashed.  And you think of the moment that happened to it. 
[00:09:00]  Of course.  You know?  So that's why it conjures up all those feelings.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, I got to get down there, but, you know, me and emotion.  Did it open yet, though?  Or is it just opening?  I think it's open for the families first.  They're going to do a...  Obama's down there today.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's giving a speech from down there at about 11.  Oh, wow.  And then, um, I guess the families get to go down there for before the really...  What do they call that?  A soft opening or whatever?  Yeah, yeah, something like that. 
[00:09:30]  You can buy tickets.  It opens May 21st.  Do you have to buy them online?  I believe so.  You can't just go there?  I mean...  That's kind of irritating.  Yeah, right?  Maybe.  Well, if they're doing it like they did with the memorial area, like, they do that to  space people out so that it's not jam-packed and...  Oh.  Oh.  The memorial's still open, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that would kind of make sense.  If you don't want a line of people kind of...  You do kind of want to be able to take your time and get those moments where it's...  Yeah, and I think they want to be kind of, like, respectful so that it doesn't look like 
[00:10:00]  a giant tourist thing where there's hundreds and hundreds of people just, like,  crammed in there.  Okay.  Just amazing.  These pictures are ridiculous.  Just amazing.  Yeah.  Giant beams.  Yeah.  What was that one?  IDs, old flags.  What's this one for?  This is a pretty big...  It looks large.  It's a piece of the North Tower.  Jeez, a twisted fucking piece of the exoskeleton there.  Yeah.  And then a lot of, you know, fireman uniforms that, you know, who the fuck knows? 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Machinery.  They got a piece of the transmitter tower.  That's on the page right before, right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all saw that take a fucking dump.  I can't see...  I don't know how big that is.  Yeah.  There's really no scale to it, but...  No.  Yeah, just, uh...  I'm just tweeting some more of these pictures, because they're just amazing.  That's why, whenever these fucking...  Whenever Muslims want to get involved with that thing down there, it just gets me like, 
[00:11:00]  no.  Well, didn't that mosque close or something?  That mosque is not open anymore.  I think they want to do something else with it, though.  That's kind of Muslim-related.  I think Muslims, you know, they have every right to do everything down there, but, you  know, just fucking don't.  Yeah, I mean...  You know, as far as your constitutional right, yeah, you got a right to do that, but could  you just fucking...  Sometimes you just gotta do the right thing.  Yeah, lay off.  But it wasn't all of it, was it? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah, we get it.  We got it.  We got you.  We got it.  We got it.  You know why it bothers people.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah, you know why it bothers people.  Don't act like you don't.  Don't use it just as a place to look like you're being victimized.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Wow, look at that old laptop.  Come on.  Where's that?  Where's that picture?  I think that guy just had an awful laptop.  Was that in the museum?  Maybe that was it.  Yep.  Make that bigger, Sam, please.  Is there a website for old pictures?  It's on the Post website.  Oh, that one didn't make the paper.  That's a big, heavy...  It's an awful laptop. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  God, it's thick.  What's that in the front?  Is that like an A-Drive load?  Or is that a...  Geez, a floppy.  No, it's not floppy, is it?  Yeah, it looks like floppy.  It's got to be a floppy.  Is floppy an A-Drive?  Did I get that right?  2001 had that shit.  Yeah.  I mean, you see the screen is small.  Very small, but the outside...  And the white boundary is big.  Yeah.  What was that about?  They just...  I don't know.  They couldn't figure that out, huh?  They just didn't have it figured out yet.  No, the monitor goes right up to the edge of the lid of the laptop.  Amazing technology.  Yeah, it's very hard to get the time frame there, because it stands out in your head like 
[00:12:30]  it was yesterday.  And I know that's kind of a corny thing to say, but...  So you forget how much time has gone by.  These exhibits are like...  They take little pieces of a store or the street or, you know, a window display of something.  Oh, an American Airlines slipper.  Wow.  Yikes.  Wow.  And they kind of set it up where they make a little scene out of it. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  That really is...  I like the fact that they didn't just do the two buildings, that they did a little bit  of the surrounding area.  Yeah.  Because there's things there that wouldn't be...  The vehicles.  From the buildings.  Yep.  The crushed vehicles that were...  The fire truck that was ripped.  Yeah, ripped in half.  Police car door.  That's always...  Glasses.  A pair of glasses.  Those are just IDs, right?  Right.  These are a lot of funeral cards.  Oh, funeral cards.  Wow, shit.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  What's the mask from?  From a burning victim who... 
[00:13:30]  Jesus.  She donated, I guess, after she was recovering.  Oh.  They have to wear that on their face.  I guess to hold everything together.  What is that?  That's part of the transmitter.  From the...  Oh, okay.  Wow, man.  Oh, my God.  We got to link this site to our Facebook page and Twitter.  Inside of a fire truck or the inside of a delivery truck?  Some type of truck, yeah.  That was the...  Whoa.  What the hell is that?  Piece of the plane, I think?  Or am I completely off?  How are these truthers going to...  No, this is easy shit for them. 
[00:14:00]  This is all stuff you can make.  Right.  This is easy.  Oh, we got you.  So that isn't even really part of the plane.  Oh, this is...  Of course.  The same way one of these scumbag truthers takes down the memorial to one of the little  girls at Newtown.  Right.  And then calls her family and said it was fake.  That's someone that's just completely mentally ill.  You have to...  As a parent, you have to kill him.  You have to kill him.  You're just a worthless, contribute nothing fucking burden.  Fuck.  People.  That happened, huh? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Just a little fucking...  A little baby who wants to yell at his own mommy and daddy and make a difference, but  he's not making a difference.  The father should kill him because he would get off the hook.  He'd be, you know...  Just say, I don't know.  It was the anger that built up.  You'd probably get probation or something like that.  Just eliminate that person, please.  Hopefully, they'll find him, but they'll just put the memorial back up.  There's always jerk-offs.  They do it to the war memorials. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  And they are.  Look at me.  I know something.  I know something that you people don't believe, and I...  They're so hateable because of how they ignore certain evidence when it's presented.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  And they argue like when I was 13.  But what about...  But what about...  Oh, yeah.  You remember that dumb girl we were arguing with these 9-11 dumb motherfucker truthers?  Yeah.  And she said, it was all voice manipulation.  It's like, you child.  Really?  You little baby child. 
[00:15:30]  I'm going to watch Mission Impossible again.  You dolt.  God.  How could you just believe that?  The stupidity.  And most of them are probably not dumb people.  That's why I hate them because they're not mentally retarded.  Right.  If a retarded guy said that, I'd go like, ah, he's trying.  They'd rather twist something around that's virtually impossible to happen than look at the  real evidence and the most simple solution to what happened.  Because that gives them a feeling like they're a part of it and they're part of the solution 
[00:16:00]  and they have some kind of control over it.  And it's just silly.  Grow up.  That's a big piece of the outside of the building.  Wow.  Yeah.  And you look at, I was looking at, like, you know, video online of the people in the  windows.  It's actually a lot of photos.  Yeah.  Either of the camera phones didn't exist then.  And just watching these dummies go over it and go like, right here, why is this guy  taller than this window?  It's like, where do you think these actors came from?  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:16:30]  It's like, that's what, you're like, did a casting call go out?  Right.  Like, okay, so where are these actors?  I love these, these fucking children that say that one of the hijackers is a pilot at  an airline over, so he's flying flights every day and he doesn't wonder why his pictures  associate with 9-11?  This is your pilot, Muhammad Atta.  Really?  You shouldn't, we shouldn't even give them, you know, the time of day.  It's just ridiculous at this point.  Unfortunately, they are, they do make the news and they do disrupt things.  The good thing is, they're pretty much a cliche now. 
[00:17:00]  Yes, they are.  And any online reference to them is usually goofing on them and, you know, they're a joke.  They're a fucking joke.  Kennedy assassination, conspiracy theorists, at least, I mean, they're a lot of times  irrational, but they, I get why that one took off.  Yeah, yeah.  And there are fringe people that have the outrageous ideas and then there are people  because the information just wasn't as available back then, so it did leave a lot of questions.  And people that want to run through real questions with real answers or real, like, potential 
[00:17:30]  answer solutions, that's fine.  But to just come up with, you know, some of these 9-11 people, it's just as wacky as  if you said a flying saucer came down and shot Kennedy in the head.  Like, that is just as wacky as some of the 9-11 truth or theories.  Once in a while, I'll think of JF King.  I'm pretty much a pro, like, Oswald did it, but there's going to be moments where I'll be  like, ugh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Some things do come up, but, yeah.  We're part of the press.  We should have been able to get down there.  I didn't know this was going on.  We're not press credentials.  The 9-11 museum.  Hello, you might know us.  Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  What?  Why are you escorting us out of here?  Yes, we want to do an expose on how we can incorporate dick jokes into this story.  If we could, thank you.  Very much.  Mm-hmm.  So that's a biggie today, obviously.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  What's the, what's the, the family has like two weeks?  The families can kind of go in and out for two weeks?  Yeah.  And then Obama down there today, he was at the Tappan Zee Bridge yesterday.  Why was he over there?  Trying to get more, uh, Congress to, uh, approve more infrastructure programs like the Tappan  Zee Bridge Reconstruction.  He was on the bridge talking?  I guess he was in front of the, you know, at a site there.  Okay.  And they're, hey, look at me.  We need to do more of this.  Cool.  I'm sure there wasn't any traffic due to that.  They closed down every fucking street by where he was. 
[00:19:00]  And that's, and how do the people get across the river up there?  There's not a lot of areas, not a lot of bridges up there.  Well, that's it.  They're going to have to build the bridge next to it.  Oh, no, I know.  I think they kind of have started really.  Yeah.  They closed down.  The problem is those projects are so expensive now.  That.  That's why it's hard to have a lot of these projects.  Is it Tappan Zee fucked up?  Because I know the parkway, the Jersey parkway down by like exit 120 something.  They built the bridge next to the bridge, but they kept the old one.  Yeah.  It's old and rusty. 
[00:19:30]  They really need to.  They usually keep the old one and then turn it into like a bike path or some kind of observation thing.  And then they're doing the Skyway too over in Jersey.  Right.  So that's going to take, I think, over a year.  Close for two years.  I'm sick on the traffic of hearing truck, truck one and nine, truck one and nine.  It's truck one and nine.  How is truck one and nine?  You want to do Chuck Heston for that?  Damn you, truck one and nine.  I'm so sick of hearing it.  That's a local Jersey reference. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, about the Pulaski.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Close for two years or something.  Two years.  Do you say that?  I'm sorry.  Two years.  Two years.  People are going to be in hell.  They're already in hell.  It started about a month ago.  I had one of my worst traffic meltdowns ever.  Patrice was in the car.  I picked him up.  I was living in North Brunswick, I think, at the time.  And he was in probably Woodbridge.  And we were coming in through the Holland for something.  And I was on the Pulaski.  And it was just one of those where it's all the way to the Holland tunnel traffic. 
[00:20:30]  And I was biting myself, pulling a Rich Voss.  I was out of my mind in a rage.  And he was just laughing at me.  Isn't that terrible?  Oh, and he was laughing at you.  Couldn't have been happier.  As far as he was concerned, in his mind, I was juggling in the seat.  It is kind of funny, though, if you're not behind the wheel.  If you're not behind the wheel.  And you see the driver losing his mind.  When you get stuck in traffic like that, and you know how far you have to go, 
[00:21:00]  and you know it's complete traffic from where you are to where you've got to get, like the tunnel,  it's just infuriating.  It's your powerlessness that gets you.  It's like, I'm in this traffic.  There's nowhere I can go.  I just have to sit here.  I think I had an audition or something during the day.  That's why I was so out of my mind.  It almost makes you cry.  Yes.  Because you really just don't know what else to do.  You don't know what else to do.  You just want to go home.  Right.  What's that so fun stuff?  You want to suck on mommy's tit at that point.  Yes.  You want to go old school.  Or you hit the steering wheel really hard, and now you sprained your wrist or something. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, you fuck yourself up.  Why?  Anyway.  Yeah.  9-11 was an inside job.  9-11 truthers.  They're calling.  Go call somebody else.  Yeah, the problem with that is I understand what the instinct is to try to get to the bottom  of things.  Yeah.  But after, like I told you, the Pentagon, I remember talking on the show, hey, there  was a couple questions, but when I heard it explained, I simply believed the explanation.  It made sense.  It made sense.  The evidence that was there made sense. 
[00:22:00]  Everything made sense.  Right.  No need to think that it was a missile.  It's like, hey, dumbbells, the government can't even set up their fucking website properly.  That's part of it, man.  It's a ruse.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  And why hasn't, it's been how many years now, 13, coming up on 13, not one person has  talked about it being an inside job.  And they'll say, yes, they have.  Yes, they have.  Bill Dawkins.  Yeah, they come up with names.  How about the fucking WikiLeaks guy that grabs a bunch of shit and fucking, you know, exposes 
[00:22:30]  that to people.  Where was one of those guys with all the people involved with 9-11 and the conspiracy?  Where's the one Snowden guy that, you know, says, I'm not going to keep quiet.  I'm going to do that.  You can't keep everyone quiet.  The fucking idiots.  Where are the fucking whistleblowers on 9-11?  There's none.  None.  And right, there's Bradley, his name is Chelsea now, Chelsea Manning, Bradley Manning, that 
[00:23:00]  guy.  Oh, yeah, that guy, girl.  Kenzie in Toronto.  Kenzie.  It's Hansie from Toronto.  Hi, Hansie.  Hansie.  No, you guys know of me, of course, but we don't know of you.  I don't know of you, Hansie.  Oh, okay, no, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool.  We really don't.  Okay, no, okay, fine.  That's cool.  But anything you guys say anyways is a fucking lie anyways.  So it doesn't really matter.  But 9-11 was an inside joke just because your media and your government doesn't tell you  that. 
[00:23:30]  But they're called, you guys are the biggest puppets in the world.  Are you doing a character?  Please tell me.  Please tell me this is a character.  Come on.  I know you wanted to say something to me for the longest fucking time, you fucking AIDS  patient, so you keep your fucking mouth shut.  But I've never heard of you.  Why would I want to say something to you, Hansie?  No, trust me, you wanted to jump on my balls, you drove my balls back for the longest fucking  time, you cock sucker.  Shut the fuck up.  I've never heard of you.  Yeah, I'm sure you've never heard of me.  Wait, how do we know you, Hansie? 
[00:24:00]  How do we know you, Hansie?  Oh, I'm a delusional conspiracy theorist, so I'm making it up.  Everyone knows who I am.  Oh, is this one of Howie's people?  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm one of Howard's people.  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  A regular call on Howard and bust it open.  So why are you listening to...  Oh, that's right.  Howard's off.  Oh, he's a real guy.  This is just who he is.  Okay.  So why do you think it's an inside job, Hansie?  You're a delusional narcissist, by the way.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, narcissist.  We don't... 
[00:24:30]  I swear to God, I've never heard of you.  Yeah, I don't listen to Stern.  I'm on the air when he's on the air.  Yeah, I know because you guys are secretly our friends, but you guys pretend like you  guys aren't friends.  Oh, that's another conspiracy.  We're friends with who?  Howard?  Who?  Yeah.  Ah.  Well, he's on to us.  Yeah, go ahead, delusional narcissist.  It's all about you.  Go ahead.  We're friends with some of the people that work over there.  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure you guys are friends with him, too.  We're not friends with Howard Stern.  We take warm showers together.  We've never got along with him.  That's right. 
[00:25:00]  Okay, okay.  And I'll ask Howard later when I see him.  Yeah.  Okay, yo, it doesn't...  Right now, there's no real major, you know, issue, but it's always boiling under the surface.  And by the way, you're implying that we're friends with somebody when we're not, and  I think you owe us an apology before we proceed.  It's inaccurate.  I'm pretty sure I'm right because...  No, you're not.  You're not right.  You're a narcissist.  You can't just say...  Right.  We're telling you we're not friends with Howard.  I just want to hear some of his ideas.  Okay, yeah.  I've never had a conversation with him, matter of fact. 
[00:25:30]  I've said hi to him, I think, twice in all the years we've kind of been around each other.  I want to get an idea...  Go ahead, Henry.  You're right.  We apologize, narcissists.  Go ahead.  We'll let you speak a little about anything you want.  Go ahead.  No, you only...  Trust me, I'm doing you a favor right now.  Sure.  You know, 9-11 was an inside job, but we wouldn't get the truth from you guys because anyone...  Hey, idiot, you got a forum, unfortunately, so why was it an inside job?  You explain it. 
[00:26:00]  Okay, I'm explaining it, but I'm saying...  You're not explaining it.  Why was 9-11 an inside job?  That's the question.  Go.  Cocksucker, shut the fuck up for a minute.  I'm trying to kill you.  I'm kind of happy Howard's off because now this guy could call us on those days off.  You're cute.  Go ahead, Hansikens.  Go ahead, baby boy.  No, I'm saying people in the media...  ...are killing them out.  You put a carry out...  You put a carry out the anti-Muslim... 
[00:26:30]  ...anti-Muslim hating agenda...  ...it's been going on for so many fucking years.  Without the anti-Muslim hating agenda, you can't invade countries.  Anti-Muslim hating?  Boy, anti-Muslim hating.  That means you're pro-Muslim hating.  You hate Muslims.  We don't.  No, I am a Muslim.  Then why are you saying anti-Muslim hating?  Right.  You're saying that we're anti-Muslim hating.  That's Muslim liking.  Yeah.  I know a bunch of Muslims and they're wonderful people, to be honest with you.  I've never had an issue with the Muslims I know. 
[00:27:00]  I've yet to meet some.  Why?  I don't know.  They're everywhere.  How can you expect us to take you seriously when you don't even know that anti-Muslim hating agenda...  Yeah.  ...you don't even know what that means?  How can we expect you to understand what conspiracy is?  No, Jim, you don't gotta take me serious.  I live in my parents' basement and I smoke pot all day.  I do nothing.  I understand.  I'm going to die for the longest fucking time, but the higher powers won't kill me.  Why do you want to die?  Let's get to that.  For what?  Yeah, but you can control that.  Oh, no, no, no, you can't.  That's the one thing you can control is when you want out of this world. 
[00:27:30]  The higher powers will never leave me fucking alone, trust me.  And you guys know what I'm talking about with that shit.  Look, are you on medication?  What are you on?  No, I'm on medication, but I don't leave my house.  Don't worry, I don't have any guns.  No one's scared of you.  We're not scared of you.  What do you take?  Hey, yo, Howard Stern acts like he's scared of me.  That's why he wouldn't get me at the birthday party, right?  I mean, so I'm just saying.  Okay, Jenny Hutt was there.  Enough said.  I guess he's scared of us, too, because, boy, did we not get the invite.  We didn't get an invite either.  I actually, I got an invite and did not go. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, okay.  We got the stay away invite.  Yeah, exactly.  How is part of the Illuminati, you know?  No, no, but you guys were at the Howard Bash, though, I think.  We weren't there.  Hope he was there.  I wasn't there.  You guys pretend like you guys aren't friends with Stern.  We're anti-party haters.  Yeah.  Something.  We probably would have got along if, you know, back in the day, things were, you know, different.  But, you know, we went down the path we did, and he stayed on his path, and that was it. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, Emron.  We probably would have got along.  You know my name, Anthony.  Hey, Emron.  How do you know my name?  I didn't say that.  What are you talking about?  You're hearing voices now.  Yeah, I'm hearing voices.  Listen, Paul, it's a side.  What's it called?  I like your show, even though I go nuts whenever Anthony opens his mouth about race, but whatever.  Emron Khan.  What?  Do you know my cousin, Paul Bernardo?  He used to live up there in Toronto.  He's a murderer. 
[00:29:00]  Emron Khan.  I almost like you, Hennessey.  Yeah, would you have had sex with Carla?  Or Henzey, whatever.  I would have fist-fucked her.  Yeah, she was really a sexy girl.  Is she sexy?  Yeah, she's a kook, but man, she's sexy.  Henzey, you didn't explain why it's an inside job, though.  All right, screw the media.  Screw that we're actually friends with Howard and all that bullshit.  Which is all true.  Why was 9-11 an inside job?  It's a very simple question.  Because they needed to invade Iraq, and they told you that they had the weapons, and that 
[00:29:30]  you know what?  Can I ask you a question without arguing with you?  Why would they leave Colin Powell hanging like that when he said that those things were  uranium?  Why wouldn't they just make up a weapon of mass destruction and find it?  The U.S. had to admit there were no weapons.  Why would we go through all this trouble and then make assholes out of ourselves?  The bigger conspiracy is that a lot of the military, the government, they try to act 
[00:30:00]  like they're stupid and that they're all clumsy and they're not doing anything right.  They know what they're doing.  Just like Columbo.  Yeah.  You know, Columbo would always walk around and go, I just can't understand.  I can't figure out how this person did.  And then everybody's like, oh, the bumbling detective is here.  And then he gets you in the end.  I understand.  Whatever, man.  Basically, I'm a piece of shit and I have theories.  So, I mean, what are you going to do?  I mean, listen.  Well, coincidentally, 9-11 certainly was a positive thing in some ways, right? 
[00:30:30]  Jeez.  No, it wasn't.  For their agenda.  For their agenda, he's saying.  For their agenda.  That's when the NW, yeah.  The NW was born on 9-11.  What was it?  Really?  From wrestling?  Oh, the New World Order.  The New World Order.  Too sweet.  Nice.  Wasn't the black bearded Hulk Hogan in that?  Yeah, it was 9-11.  For life.  And we all know Hulk Hogan did it for us.  Can we see the picture of Sam, please?  Oh, absolutely.  No, but when wrestling, like guys like wrestling. 
[00:31:00]  Kevin Nash and Scott Hall?  Yeah, the outsiders.  Crazy.  Nice.  They have preconditioned programming for like years.  Hey, hey.  Hey, Henze.  Yeah?  I'm going to punch a hole in your theory, though.  So, if it was an inside job, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Why hasn't one guy come forward and said, hey, man, I know this was an inside job.  I have to talk about this finally.  I was in on it, and here's the evidence.  Because it's got to be.  Hold on.  To pull off something like that, you've got to think hundreds, if not a thousand people would have to be involved. 
[00:31:30]  So, why hasn't one person come forward and said, man, this was an inside job.  This was what I was.  Huh?  A bunch of people have.  Who?  Name one name.  Okay, hold on.  You know, the coincidence when Charlie Sheen started voicing his opinion about 9-11, all of a sudden he started getting caught by police for all this other...  Oh, Charlie Sheen was in on it.  Do you know, I noticed the same thing.  I noticed that as well, and I said it on the air.  Yeah, Charlie Sheen was flying one of the planes, actually. 
[00:32:00]  No, I'm telling you, man.  They fuck with every...  False flag operation.  They kill celebrities, and...  I believe Bill Hicks is Alex Jones.  Bill Hicks is Alex Jones.  Wow.  He does look a little like him in the face, but some of Hicks' friends would have noticed.  That's pretty good.  And they definitely sound similar.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a bit...  Alex Jones claims he's like 35.  This guy's like 50.  There's a plan to make Arizona Bay. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  We've got to laugh out of hand.  I don't think Alex Jones is claiming that he's 35.  I hope he's not.  There's no way he's claiming that.  No, he says he's born in 1972.  He might be shaving a few years off.  Well, 72 would make him 42.  Oh, okay.  Do you have a bunch of news clippings on your wall with a bunch of threads and pins going  from one to another?  Did you finally realize that the little girl never aged?  Right.  And that was what happened?  Do you put everything in the drop box by the big mansion? 
[00:33:00]  Would Ed Harris come by your house a lot?  Get it?  Yes, I know.  That's a good movie, by the way.  It really is.  I like that beautiful mind.  Henzey, we're doing a super show tomorrow.  I think you need an invite, right?  I can't go to New York.  Why not?  Why?  I have no fucking money, man.  Oh, man.  How old a guy are you?  I'm 30 and I'm doing nothing.  I'm convinced people make money off me, off my Stern Show fame.  Well, what have you wanted to do?  Stern Show fame. 
[00:33:30]  I swear I've never heard of you.  They've heard of you, dude.  It's not a big deal.  The Illuminati knows about you.  Don't worry about it.  Right.  You guys don't know me, but all three of you blocked me on Twitter.  Well, who are you?  I go figure.  Wow.  Yeah, honestly, dude.  I got the trifecta.  You're one of a lot of people if I blocked you on Twitter.  Yes.  What was your Twitter name?  I'll unblock you.  I apologize.  No, it's all good.  You don't have to unblock me.  No, but I want to.  I feel bad.  I want to follow you.  Yeah, I need to follow you.  Yo, tell Amy Schumer to unblock me.  Uh-oh.  Well, you have to tell me what your name is first. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Henze 83.  Henze 83?  I think I remember him.  I don't.  Oh, that's when you were born, 83.  Henze 83.  Let me see what this is all about.  Yeah, you probably said some things that we found questionable.  You probably said some really shitty things.  I did.  I go nuts sometimes.  I listen to your show sometimes.  Wait, wait.  How do you spell Henze?  D-O-U-C-H-E.  Huh?  It's H-A-N-Z-I.  Oh, H-A-N-Z-I.  What?  H-A-N-Z-I.  Henze.  Henze Y.  No E, huh?  No, I. 
[00:34:30]  I.  I.  Henze.  H-A-N-S-E-Y, right?  No, Z-Y.  All right.  So, what?  H-A-N-Z-E-Y, right?  Yes.  H-A-N-Z-I-E-E-3.  Z-I-E-E-E-E-3.  H-E-N-Z-I.  Okay.  You know, Howard and Gary finds out you called us, they're probably never going to take your  call again.  No, I actually, I told Howard, I go, oh, you don't want me to call the other show.  He's like, you can call any show you want, whatever. 
[00:35:00]  Well, any show but this one.  He told me you were probably going to call.  I mean, we had dinner and he probably, he said you were going to call.  Yeah.  Well, I figured because you guys are friends with Artie, probably.  Yeah, I have friends with Artie and Howard, I know Artie well.  Jimmy's friends with Artie, that's for sure.  I lived with Howard for two years back in the 80s.  We tried to help out Artie, but he decided not to come on our show or anything.  That's fine.  That's up to him.  Dude, what's your Illuminati ID?  That's created by that Dr. Ivan guy that does like, designs for Howard or some shit.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Same guy.  Now, let me ask you, do you think that, you know Dr. Ivan, right?  I swear, I've talked to him many times.  I don't remember this guy on Twitter.  Hansi, do you think that the Illuminati whole thing, I love that one, doesn't it bother you  that the Illuminati is supposed to be all-powerful and yet David Petraeus, who ran the Iraq War  and was the head of the CIA, couldn't even fuck a girl on the side without getting busted  by email?  Well, you see, all that shit on the surface is all bullshit.  No, no, no, Hansi, but who's more covert than the head of the CIA? 
[00:36:00]  No, you're right.  The CIA is the end-all, that's what I'm saying.  It's all fake shit in the surface.  You're forgetting the Columbo theory, Jimmy.  I think the Illuminati has been split into two where like...  The Illuma and the Nadi?  Whoa.  No, no, no.  It's like in the 80s and the 90s, it was all evil and now it's like more people...  Like, for example, you guys had a servant agenda...  It's more mainstream, like punk rock.  At first, it was very scary, very punky.  Yeah, they're Green Day.  And then it got very acceptable, right? 
[00:36:30]  I guess.  I guess, too.  Yeah.  You did guess.  What have they diagnosed you with?  I'm bipolar.  Oh, all right.  Bipolar's rough, man.  That one's a rough one, man.  So what do you have, your good days and your bad days?  Yeah, I guess.  The earth is bipolar, though, isn't it?  It kind of is.  When you really think about it.  You have sex with both poles.  Well.  Oof.  Boo.  The Illuminati are booing me on that one.  Yes.  All right, Hensi or Hensi or whatever. 
[00:37:00]  We got to go eat.  Yeah, we got to eat and shit.  All right.  Yo, listen, I'm a fan of both shows, but I wanted to call in for the longest time to  argue with Anthony, but...  You got it.  You did pretty good.  You did pretty good, sir.  I was actually even texting with Howard, and he said that you're good, and you can call  our show.  He doesn't care.  All right.  Cool, man.  All right.  All right, Emron.  Take it easy, man.  All right, Bill.  There he goes.  See you, Frank.  Hensi.  That guy's batshit.  I don't know.  He made a good point.  Did he?  Yeah.  What about you?  I missed it. 
[00:37:30]  Oh.  All right.  We got a busy day.  We're going to take a break, eat some food.  We got more Donald Sterling audio.  I actually watched it last night.  You did?  I watched Anderson Pooper with his little show on CNN.  Do we got the clip of him saying that the broad was an animal in bed?  Yes.  All right.  We got that.  He started crying.  Oh, no.  He was crying.  Why is Anderson Cooper releasing the video slowly?  Because they want ratings. 
[00:38:00]  They need ratings.  They think that that's...  And then right after Anderson Cooper, they're like, and now the news.  And the top story was like just what we saw on Anderson Cooper.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  They're embarrassing themselves, CNN.  Like, they're getting away from news and going into entertainment, I guess.  Yeah.  They're trying.  They can't compete with Fox.  None of these can, really.  No.  Fox is a juggernaut.  We got the latest on Donald Sterling after the break.  We got the Elvis Duran audio that maybe we'll play today.  We got apologies today. 
[00:38:30]  More?  Oh, yeah.  The Shutterfly one's pretty hilarious, actually.  Nice.  And I think we have a couple.  I think we have three today, to be honest with you, because we missed yesterdays.  And then we got Keith Robinson coming in for the first time in a long time.  And Rich Voss.  And Rich Voss.  Oh.  So another very busy show.  But first, it's George Brett's birthday, everyone.  61 years old.  Ah.  We got Donald Sterling audio.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  You kind of heard it, right?  Yeah, I saw him live, but I didn't see the whole thing. 
[00:39:00]  Sam's just chatting out there.  He's just having a good old chat.  And we need him to...  Hey, stupid!  We need to have him at the computer so he can play the audio.  Hey, stupid.  Now he's shaking his head.  Fucking Troy and Kenny, they're having like a little fucking three hens having a coffee clutch.  Little hens.  Whatever it is, clutch.  Hey, we want to get Arlie Ermey on.  Yeah, I know.  Can we get him on?  Let me talk to Roland.  Where is he?  Roland?  Yeah.  He's in the office.  Well, did you know? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Is someone telling him?  Yeah.  Roland, please?  Of course.  Bring him up.  We'll say hello.  Yes.  Does the dog bark at us?  We'll pet it?  Hey, what's up, dog?  Arr, arr, arr, arr.  Um.  I want the Donald Sterling clip about how great she was in bed.  So I guess now he's finally admitting they were an item or something, right?  And he was kind of being vague about that for a little while.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  If he didn't fuck her and he bought her, he's dumber than I thought.  He bought her a car and didn't fuck her.  He's the dumbest man alive.  Yeah.  Right. 
[00:40:00]  And he's asking for forgiveness.  Yeah.  And he's saying that if he had a second chance at being the owner, that the team would not  boycott and leave him.  What?  Something like that.  Oh, yeah.  That was in the paper today, too.  All right.  Here's the clip, though.  The broad.  He's talking about the broad.  The broad.  The broad.  The broad.  That bitch.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  The broad.  You know, I'm embarrassed that a man 80 years old would try to make it with a girl. 
[00:40:30]  I'm embarrassed.  But I tried.  You know?  You're right.  You're right.  And I did before.  It wasn't easy.  Let me tell you, it wasn't easy.  But this chick is something else.  Yeah.  So I would say anything to her and whatever she was an animal.  And to deal with her was even harder.  Listen, I'm telling you, she was hot. 
[00:41:00]  It took maybe an hour to get there, but it was hot.  So why did I do it?  Because I'm 80 years old now.  No, I know.  But I mean, everything you bought her from the car.  She was pretty.  You know, everything you did for her.  And then for her to just come around and do this, I'm just.  Well, she wanted more.  And she said she was going to get it.  Or bring me down.  Here's how I felt.  And if you can understand, here's a poor girl, a Mexican girl, never had anything in her life. 
[00:41:30]  Never had food.  Never had clothes.  And I meet her.  She's got a fabulous body.  She wanted the cashmere.  And she loves to have sex.  And she's just fun.  And I think, well, what if I gave her some money?  What if I helped her?  And what if I helped her family?  God was good to me.  Save your complex.  I want to do it.  And I did it.  And her mother.  You changed lives, basically. 
[00:42:00]  Basically, what you did was change the whole family's life.  I changed the whole family's life.  I changed it.  And I wanted to.  I hate to admit it in front of my wife.  He didn't have a complex.  He just wanted to fuck a chick.  That's all.  He just wanted to fuck a chick.  Yeah, but the way he's talking, like, and she had no food.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't care about any of that stuff.  He's what the fucker.  No, this is a setup.  I don't know who the guy on the other line is.  That's Maserati.  Oh, that's the Maserati guy.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Maserati claimed to be Donald Sterling's pimp comes forward.  Oh, yeah.  So then we got the audio of him coming forward?  Yeah, he was on Don Lemon's CNN show.  Why does CNN get all these exclusives?  They have 300 viewers.  Yeah, right?  Why is Maserati?  Why is he coming forward?  A pimp that can't be trusted.  What's the world coming to?  We got more of this audio?  Yeah.  So this is Maserati he's talking to, and then we're going to have audio Maserati.  Hey, Maserati.  Talking to Don Lemon.  Maserati.  He's not Italian.  No, doesn't sound it. 
[00:43:00]  She's got footage of you guys, you know...  Having sex?  Having sex.  No.  No, no, no.  She doesn't have that.  So she's just trying to stir up more stuff, keep to keep...  She may have me in a bed, you know, in a bed, but no, she doesn't have anything like that.  No sex.  How does he know?  You know, the girl is sharp, very sharp, you know?  And everybody in the world wants a poster, I'm telling you. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah?  Everyone in the world?  That fucker.  What about that Magic Johnson?  He's got AIDS!  He's got AIDS!  He's got AIDS!  He's got AIDS!  So he was talking to Maserati there.  That was on CNN last night.  So, Mr. Sterling, what do you think about Sam Roberts?  He's got AIDS.  Wow, that's crazy.  Damn. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, wow.  What does Sam need to do about his age?  He's got AIDS.  What?  How are you making him work in there?  I just...  Yeah.  Oh, I know what he's supposed to do.  Oh, I got it.  There's only one big button in there.  I got it.  You think?  Yeah.  You don't think I have 60 buttons, actually, and I need to go back and forth?  No.  It was saying you can only do one thing at a time, but one thing...  Oh, right.  Get over it.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Get you to think.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole Teft family watching the Habs last night.  That's why he's a little sleepy.  It's a great game.  What happened last night?  They won.  They beat the Bruins?  Yes.  On to the Rangers.  On to the Rangers.  Yeah.  That's a big one right there, huh?  That sucks for the Bruins.  Got to go Canadians, Travis.  You know that.  Don't do that.  I have to go Canadians or the Rangers.  I prefer if you didn't.  Oh.  But I really do have to.  That's okay, though.  Just, you know...  I have to do that for you. 
[00:45:00]  Just keep it to yourself.  All right.  Yeah.  I do have to, though.  No.  No.  You don't have to.  I do have to.  That was a very adorable picture.  We're an adorable family.  The whole little family sitting there drinking some Canadian beers, watching the game.  You all had your Habs shirts on.  You didn't want to go to bed.  Oh.  Can you tell me who won in the morning?  No.  She wasn't allowed to stay up to watch?  No.  We're shitty parents.  Yeah, man.  You want to let the kid watch?  No, because in the end, she just wants to stay up because we're watching it. 
[00:45:30]  She doesn't want to stay up and watch the game.  She's not interested in the game, really?  Well, she is, but it's like, you know, if she could say, oh, no, I want to watch the  game, she's just going to sit there and eventually start playing on the iPad or something.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I thought she was rooting for her.  But, you know, four and a half, almost five years old, they get really good at this  lying thing.  Right.  Right.  You're telling me.  Oh, there it is.  Look how cute.  Very nice.  Nice family picture there.  Now it's me versus Roland for the next week. 
[00:46:00]  There was trash talking and trash mumbling happening.  Trash mumbling.  Before the show started.  Is that what Roland does?  He trash mumbles.  Let's get him in here.  I want to hear this.  He's good.  Is he good?  Yeah.  He dominates.  Yeah, he got me.  But is he wearing a Canadian's jersey today to get the high fives on the subway?  You know, I wore my Canadian's hoodie this morning.  I didn't get any high fives.  No high fives.  No, it's weird.  Going to any games? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  Well, the New York ones are sold out.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Well, let's get the Montreal ones going.  You can't go to somebody here at Sirius XM and say, sorry, I couldn't even finish that.  All right.  You get an invoice in the end.  Thanks for nothing.  Yes, E-Rock.  Roland's not here.  Why?  What happened?  He's over at Fox getting Arlie Ermey.  He's trying to get Arlie Ermey.  Oh, that Roland.  That Roland is a go-getter, isn't he?  Yeah, Roland's a good booker.  What's the mash-up on your shirt now?  Hold on, come here. 
[00:47:00]  You've seen this a few times.  It's a yellow skeleton ghost face in a purple Grim Reaper's hood.  What is it?  Fucking yellow monster?  It's after your time.  It's after my time.  He's not wrong.  That is a He-Man thing?  Well, it's Jack Skellington from Nightmare Before Christmas and Skeletor.  And Skeletor, yeah.  Did you like that one?  Yes.  I hate his mash-up shirts.  They're terrible shirts. 
[00:47:30]  Just go with one single theme and stick with it.  I know.  It's all the rage.  There's more coming.  I want to see a mash-up of Iraq and a bus.  I don't want to see that.  That's terrible.  I didn't mean that.  Yeah.  All right, let's get to the Maserati.  All right.  So Maserati goes on Don Lemon.  He was the guy in the Don Sterling tape there.  And now he's throwing Don Sterling under the bus a bit.  Yeah, he is.  What the fuck?  I'm starting to feel sorry for this, Sterling. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, jeez.  You can't trust anyone around him.  No one.  I know.  A girl 50 years younger than he fucks in a pimp.  It's amazing.  He's trusting the best people.  Change the people he hangs out with.  How long have you known Don Sterling, and how did you meet him?  Straight off the bat.  I knew Don about five, six years.  How I know him, that's a good question.  You know, Don likes to have fun. 
[00:48:30]  Don likes a lot of women.  I mean, it's obvious.  The world knows Don.  I mean, it's no surprise.  So how did you meet him?  So how I met him.  I met him through a, I met him through a few, a friend of mine introduced me to him,  and I actually ran a service in Las Vegas.  A service?  So in your previous life, let's see, you were involved in an escort service.  Is that how you know Donal Sterling?  Correct.  That's how I know him.  So you introduced him to some ladies from time to time. 
[00:49:00]  That's just correct.  Okay.  And go on.  And after a while, I just, I mean, he didn't show no sign of racist to me.  So, I mean, he seemed, you know, straight, you know, straight cool.  He didn't have any, he never showed no sign of racist to me.  So just when I heard the tape, it just really threw me off, you know.  Did he like a certain kind of girl?  Did the race of a girl matter or anything like that?  Could you pause for once?  Is it possible?  He liked the light skin.  He liked the light skin. 
[00:49:30]  He always preferred light skin in women.  But that's news?  What kind of hookers did he like?  Right.  That's fucking news?  Well, in this day and age, it sure is.  I think this guy is somehow, so far, it doesn't seem like he's hurting Donald Sterling at all.  Right.  I think he's probably working for him.  Really?  I guess.  Yeah.  I mean, why else would this guy, maybe he's just betraying his trust.  Right.  But would Sterling be stupid enough to open up to this guy?  Maybe he would.  I mean, I think he sounds like a work.  I think he's desperate enough to open up to whoever that'll get the, you know, the other side out there for him. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, right, but he's trying to get the other side out of it.  And he likes light skinned women.  That's right.  Likes skinned.  Light skinned.  He continues here.  You said that you recorded your conversations with Donald Sterling.  There have been a few different Donald Sterling tapes to emerge.  And so to be clear, which of those tapes of you and Donald Sterling, which one are you talking on?  All the conversations.  All the, there's, there, though, everyone besides the Vista Viano, everyone besides that, that, that, uh, that girl. 
[00:50:30]  Um, or me.  I mean, it's me and him.  It's me and his conversation.  The one released to Radar Online that was just released today, and then wasn't there one released, the Daily Mail today, and then one released at Radar Online about a week ago.  Correct.  All the tapes.  Yeah, those are, it's about, I mean, it's a two-hour, it's like a two-hour conversation.  Right.  I mean, those are just minutes, you know, those are clips, I believe.  Yeah.  Maserati, did you get paid for those tapes?  Honestly, no.  There was no money involved, really.  It was, I mean, I, anybody who know me, I mean, they, I got money. 
[00:51:00]  It's all, I'm already successful, and, um, I'm not, it wasn't really in it for the money.  I mean, you can reach out to sources.  I didn't get any money for the tapes.  So you didn't, we have an affidavit here from an attorney that says that you own the tapes, right?  But you, and you're telling the truth that, that, because we can find out, you did not get paid for these tapes.  I didn't get paid for the tapes, no.  Okay.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  Didn't get paid for the tapes. 
[00:51:30]  How is this, this, this is what this is degenerated to.  Some Vegas pimp, or whatever, the guy who runs an escort service.  Right, right.  Is being interviewed as a news, like, did you talk to Donald on the phone?  What color girls did he like to fuck?  Yeah.  What a shitty country.  It really is the, the, the bottom of the barrel of news.  Do you feel any guilt or?  No, no, I don't feel any guilt.  Just like he, I mean, I don't, when he apologized, I didn't take his apology serious.  So, um, you know, I, you, he said he was just trying to have sex with her. 
[00:52:00]  And in that case, uh, you don't, you, you, you went a little bit too far to, you know, you didn't take that much.  You didn't have to say that much to, to just get the girl laid down.  I mean, she, you know, we call those type of female stocks, you know, we don't, those, she's a type of female.  Don't take that, that much to, to, uh, to have, you know, sex with.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  Mm.  And then finally, yeah. 
[00:52:30]  So listen, did, did he know that you were recording him?  No, he didn't know.  He didn't know.  So do you don't feel like you set him up?  No, I didn't feel like I set him up.  I, I, I, I really don't.  I, when I first called him, it wasn't recorded.  And then he just, uh, when he started dwelling, just drilling me, I hit the recording button.  I don't know.  I hit the recording button.  I don't know.  And, um, I didn't care at the time.  I mean, this, you know, this guy, he said some stuff that I got offended to.  And, and, um, and then talking about Magic Johnson, I mean, well, I look up to Magic Johnson. 
[00:53:00]  So, you know, clearly, you know, I, I believe it just really ticked me off.  So that's what made me hit the record button.  So the, the Magic Johnson part and, oh yeah.  Magic Johnson part for Siri, really.  That was like when he was just, you know, when he talked about Magic Johnson, I mean, I have, I have it on the audio.  I haven't put out.  I don't, I'm not going to put stuff, everything out, but, um, you know, he's just trashing them.  So, I mean, come on.  Yeah.  Um, so a friend wouldn't do that. 
[00:53:30]  But at this point, I guess you don't feel like you're a friend.  No, we're not friends.  No, not at all.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  There you go.  Maserati now speaking.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  You fucking tape this shit.  Right.  Played it.  But this guy can't talk about anything without being recorded.  Secretly taping Donald Sterling.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Gotta shut his mouth.  Just jot things down.  Hold it up and then eat the evidence.  A mobster.  Under the umbrella with their hands in front of their face. 
[00:54:00]  Should've got, uh, Reverend Al in his briefcase.  To tape Donald Sterling.  Yeah.  Good old Reverend Al.  So that's the latest, huh?  You said you saw the whole interview?  Yeah, I saw him crying at some point.  He was like, uh.  Begging for forgiveness still?  No, he was pretty much going, everyone just wants to be loved.  Oh my God, really?  It was so embarrassing.  I wonder if Sterling knew he was being taped anyway. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah?  I wonder if he went under the assumption he was being taped.  He seems like a real dope.  He couldn't be that dumb, though.  I don't know.  Maybe just old.  Maybe not a dope.  Hmm?  Right?  Yeah, probably just old.  Not understanding any type of...  He probably still assumes it's a tape recorder.  Right?  Yeah.  That records you.  I didn't see any giant reel-to-reel.  Right.  And a giant microphone. 
[00:55:00]  I think that's what it is.  He doesn't realize technology is quite impressive these days.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  That's it on that, I guess.  Yeah, not much more happening over there.  I think this story is kind of petering out, as they say.  Yeah, it'll pick back up when the court case starts or...  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  When he takes it to the Supreme Court.  He hasn't really filed anything yet, right?  No.  He's just kind of sitting back. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  He's probably hoping that, you know, everyone calms down and then Silver there says,  All right.  All right, you daffy bastard.  Come on back in.  I don't think that's...  We love ya.  Not with them.  I think the Magic Johnson comments are worse for him than what he initially said of the girl.  Yeah.  I think he might be right on that.  Yeah.  Because, like, we've been saying, you know, Magic's royalty.  He's beloved.  He's a national treasure.  He sure is. 
[00:56:00]  That's what they say.  All right.  Got a DJ that got fired.  What did he do?  Is that the English guy?  Yeah, I think it was an accident.  He played some old song that had the N-word in it.  Really?  Yeah, BBC Radio Devon.  DJ David Lowe loses job over racist word.  Whoops.  What happened?  He didn't say it, though?  He just played a...  BBC Radio Devon DJ David Lowe, 68, said he was unaware that a 1930... 
[00:56:30]  Would you know this?  He was unaware that a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On included the N-word.  Oh, I know.  That's one of my favorite songs.  I play it all the time at home.  Of course I know.  Mr. Lowe, a broadcaster for 32 years, said it was an innocent mistake.  I believe him.  Of course.  He said the BBC boss had declined his idea of an on-air apology and his offer to fall on my sword was accepted.  The BBC said it accepted that the situation could have been handled better and offered freelance Mr. Lowe his job back. 
[00:57:00]  What?  What?  The BBC said it accepted that the situation could have been handled better and offered freelance Mr. Lowe his job back.  Oh, okay.  But the DJ said the incident had exasperated a stress-related condition and he would not be returning to the corporation.  So, all right, in the end they realized it probably was an innocent mistake, so they said, oh, come on back.  And he's like, no, man, I can't, I now can't come back.  My condition's exasperated. 
[00:57:30]  The second verse of the song recorded by the UK dance band Ambrosia and his orchestra features the line,  he's been tanning N-word out in Timbuktu, now he's coming back to do the same to you.  Do we have the actual, uh, that?  And Tony writes to...  I was just listening to his show.  What the hell was that?  Was that his voice?  That was in.  You want to hear him?  Well, he sounds like a giant.  That was David Lowe.  It's here, David Lowe.  Do you have giantism?  Say, dear David, it'll be my wife Pam's 63rd birthday on the 6th of May, so on Sunday the 4th of May, 
[00:58:00]  can you please play Magnificent Obsession by Nat King Cole?  Also, in memory of Pam's mum, Betty Chandler, who would have celebrated her 88th birthday on the 9th of May.  What's with my fucking chair?  Regards to your journey from Tony Power in Brixham.  My chair's broken.  Thanks for your email, Tony, and many happy returns to you, Pam, for your 63rd birthday on Tuesday. 
[00:58:30]  Have an enjoyable day, won't you?  Holy shit!  What a hell of a voice.  Just slowing that down a little bit or something, right?  That doesn't sound like a guy that purposefully plays songs with the word nigger on it.  And they understood in the end.  But I guess he's in bad health.  Do we have the song?  Yeah.  We'll all be happy.  Hip, hip, hip, hooray.  The sun has got his head on and he's coming on today. 
[00:59:00]  Hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray.  Never saw the grass, just greener.  Never saw the sky, serena.  What a lot of fun for everyone.  Sitting in the sun all day.  The sun has got his head on.  Hip, hip, hip, hooray.  The sun has got his head on and he's coming on today.  He's been tanning niggers.  Popping Timbukum.  Right there, what'd he say?  Something nigger, what'd he say? 
[00:59:30]  He's been tanning niggers.  Yeah, I said it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I said it.  He's been tanning niggers.  The lyric is he's been tanning n-word out in Timbukum.  Now he's coming back to do the same to you.  Go back so that we can hear that again, please.  Wow.  The sun has got his head on and he's coming on today.  He's been tanning niggers.  Popping Timbukum.  Now he's coming back to do the same to you.  So he's talking about the sun. 
[01:00:00]  The sun has his hat on and the sun has been, you know, tanning.  Oh, okay.  Now, later versions of that song took that word out.  It did.  But the 1932 version, you know, has it in there.  He says some interesting things here, by the way.  Oh?  I offered to apologize or to fall on my sword, he said.  Unfortunately, the BBC decided on the latter option.  I don't have any quarrels with any of my colleagues.  It's the system of political correctness which has turned this into a rather badly handled affair. 
[01:00:30]  I think we're all too ready to bow to political correctness, he says.  One feels one is following a verbal tightrope, even in casual conversation.  Uh-huh.  Man, does he speak the truth.  He knows the deal.  He's a DJ.  Right.  He added, I made a silly mistake.  My first error in more than 30 years of broadcasting.  I am deeply embarrassed by it.  You should fucking be fired for playing that song in the first place.  Who the hell plays that music?  Well, I think it's one of those freeform shows.  He's got this hot ton. 
[01:01:00]  I actually like that.  Did you like it?  But is that heavy beat was added after, right?  Yeah, that was a remix.  That was a remix?  It's a great Gatsby.  I think, yeah, it's one of those freeform shows.  And I think it came from his personal record collection.  So, he comes in with all his records and plays his stuff.  And now the house next door to me.  Let's see.  He added, I made a silly mistake.  Okay.  I am deeply embarrassed by it.  He said, a health problem which caused tremors in his limb has been exasperated by the stress  of the situation. 
[01:01:30]  So, they were willing to bring him back, realizing, all right, this was ridiculous.  It was an innocent mistake.  But because of the health issues, he's out.  Man.  His show was called Singers and Swingers.  And we would be happy to have him back on air.  So, all right.  It's not as bad as I first thought.  No, they kind of saw the error of their ways.  Right.  Good for him.  Good for him is right.  That is a wacky voice, though, to have. 
[01:02:00]  Sounds like he's got the giantism.  Yep.  Dude, it's running through my head.  It's a catchy little ditty.  Yeah.  He's been dead.  What the fuck are they thinking?  Back then, that was probably just as, you know.  I know.  It's amazing.  I bet Chalky White don't like that shit.  Man, that's what the son was doing. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Make my Chalky White face.  Very, very impressive.  It's my Chalky face.  Mm-hmm.  Shutterfly is apologizing.  Do you want to get into some apologies?  I love a good apology.  Sure.  We got three today as we try to go ten days without an apology.  Go black.  Three of them.  Shutterfly really fucked up.  Shutterfly, sorry for congratulating people on non-existent babies. 
[01:03:00]  Woppa.  Photo printing website Shutterfly is apologizing after sending a mass email to users congratulating them on their new arrivals.  Uh-huh.  A lot of our fans have been tweeting the email.  They all got it.  I guess if you sign up for the service, I've used Shutterfly.  It's a very good service, by the way.  What is it exactly?  You get your pictures done, and they make little, you know, little booklets and stuff.  Very, very easy to use.  What, do you email them in?  Like, there was an Apple thing that did that you email?  You just go on the site, and you got your pictures, and then, you know, they give you all sorts of options to make it look all nice and pretty. 
[01:03:30]  And then they email it to you.  And then they mail you the final product, yeah.  Oh, do you have a book called Friends that just all three of us are in?  Like, just chums are still in front.  It's empty pages.  I got friends.  You guys just don't know my friends.  I got friends.  Shutterfly.  So, yeah, nonexistent babies photoprinting on their new arrivals. 
[01:04:00]  The problem, many people who got the message today aren't moms.  The misstep sparked a social media storm as slighted users blasted Shutterfly for being insensitive.  The company apologized in a statement individually to hundreds of people on Twitter.  This morning, an email was sent out unintentionally to some customers.  We deeply apologize for any offenses may have caused, Shutterfly said.  I don't get what was the...  Someone...  Maybe they...  I don't know. 
[01:04:30]  How would they...  Why would they do this at all?  Maybe when you sign up, if...  I don't know.  What's the apology for?  Like, what bad happened?  I can understand an error in sending out an email, but why is this bad?  Well, I'm sure there's people out there that are trying real hard to have a baby.  Oh!  And they've been unsuccessful, and then they get this.  I totally didn't even think of that.  That could kind of hurt some people's emotions out there.  Oh, a woman that just had a miscarriage. 
[01:05:00]  All that shit.  Oh, would that be insensitive?  Congratulations on your new...  That's kind of where you got to apologize.  Yeah.  All that.  They show what they sent out.  It says, congratulations.  She's swiffering the linoleum.  She gets that email.  Oh, Jesus.  Congrats on your little stewed tomato.  Oh, my God.  This really affects people out there.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, congrats on your sucked-on gummy bear.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  They're all slimy and small. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, congrats on your jolly rancher.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I know a bunch of people that just can't have kids there, sir.  Yeah.  I know some I wish couldn't.  That's a rough one for people.  Oh, my God.  The Roberts like that.  Still trying, Sam?  No, I told you.  I'm not.  What? 
[01:06:00]  You still drinking your own cum out of a condom?  He's having what he calls a good shake.  Yes.  Anyway, they sent out.  It says, congratulations.  Welcome to Shutterfly.  There's nothing more amazing than bringing a new life into the world.  Oh.  As a new parent.  Dr. Frankenstein.  You're going to find more to love, more to give, and more to share.  We're here to help you every step of the way.  There's a lot more amazing than bringing a new life into the world.  Did you ever get your ass eaten?  Amazing.  They should have a congratulations for that.  Absolutely. 
[01:06:30]  Congratulations on the dumpster tonguing.  Good work.  Well done.  Wow.  That's a picture and everything, huh?  Oh, imagine that.  You're trying to have a baby, and they send a nice little baby picture around.  What's the recipe?  Because the article didn't have this part.  Now it's time to send thank you cards.  Find one that matches your birth announcement.  Just make up for it by sending pictures of an abandoned old shack. 
[01:07:00]  Jeez.  Cobwebs.  Hey, Lord.  Building in Detroit.  There you go.  Yes.  Fucking balloon tied to us.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Yeah.  You're an awful person.  I'm terrible.  Holy shit.  It's fucking beautiful.  You have absolutely not one ounce of love in your soul.  I don't know.  I just.  Let's say hi to Eric in Baltimore.  Eric. 
[01:07:30]  Yellow.  Well, I've got one better than that.  On Mother's Day, an infertility clinic in Maryland sent out a happy Mother's Day message.  It was supposed to go to the successful moms that had gotten pregnant.  The girl sent it to everyone.  Oh, no.  Was there an LOL after it?  Yeah.  So literally.  What's this guy calling from a bathysphere?  What's a bathysphere?  Oh, a pump and helium.  Probably bigger bathysphere. 
[01:08:00]  Under the sea.  Deep under the sea.  Uh-oh.  I guess I went a little too far.  It's okay.  My bathysphere humor.  Did it go over?  Yes.  Bathysphere is a hard punchline for a joke.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right, Eric.  Thank you, I guess.  Let me say hi to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Yeah, hi.  I got one from Shutterfly also.  My wife had said, congratulations on your toilet, babe.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, by the way, when is Kenneth Keith Kalman back following me? 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  I swear we didn't even know that guy.  That's going back.  That is the God's honest truth.  I never heard of him.  Never heard of the guy.  That guy.  They did.  And Howard had told me about him.  All right.  Okay.  We're on all this route to lunch, a secret lunch.  Oh.  No big deal.  The guy knows.  I couldn't tell you the last time I actually listened to Howard.  That's the God's honest truth.  On the way in this morning.  I'm going to whack out.  I came in with hope we were listening to Howard and talking about that guy.  All right.  I'm going to Keith Kalman back.  Thank you, Adam.  Wow.  Watch it out.  All right. 
[01:09:00]  Janesville, Wisconsin, superintendent issues apology for kids react to gay marriage video.  Oh.  Yes.  As a school district superintendent issued a public apology Tuesday for the showing of a video that she describes as pro-gay marriage and in violation of district policies requiring the presentation of all sides of controversial or political topics.  Interesting.  I've seen this video.  You have seen the video.  You have seen the video.  Yeah.  They kind of show kids like two people, you know, guys or girls married. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  And then they ask them, you know, what they think about it.  And it's like, well, if they love each other, it's good.  Right.  It's not that complicated for them.  Yeah.  16-minute video of children reacting to marriage proposals between same-sex couples and sharing their thoughts on issues like gay marriage bans or whether they would stay friends with someone who told them they were gay.  Were they being judged on their answers or just kind of expressing what they thought? 
[01:10:00]  I got the video.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's the video.  That's the video they watch and then they, I guess, have an open discussion in the classroom about it.  Hard man-on-man fight.  What's a clit licking?  What do you think of this?  Yeah.  This is strange to me because where my kid goes to school, you can't even have, like, you know, holiday decorations up.  Yeah, yeah.  And then all the schools are showing this.  Yeah.  It's hot.  Let's see the video.  Let's hear some of this.  Let's hear some of this.  Girl-girl wedding.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's something.  He does have a nice suit.  I have to say that. 
[01:10:30]  When somebody proposes to me, that's what I want to happen.  How do they get Home Depot to approve this, though?  Is he a businessman?  That's cool.  Okay, so.  They're watching a guy propose to another guy.  But they don't know it's another guy yet, right?  Yeah, they do.  Oh, they do.  Oh, I see there.  Okay.  Because they love him.  Good friends.  Is he going to propose?  Home Depot?  Is that where they did it?  Let's see.  It's very funny.  I don't know if you're more than anything in this entire world.  Oh, boy.  A guy propose to a guy. 
[01:11:00]  Are they gay?  Ah-ha.  Yes.  Kids are twitching like Jimmy.  Yes.  You mean a boy marrying a boy?  Yes, guys.  That's nice.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  The looks on some of these kids are very funny.  Her eyes are hilarious.  Is that a little gay?  A little more wood in Home Depot.  Looks like a yellow one.  Does it have a little hair called over?  He did.  That was just so cute.  I can't even.  Okay.  I know. 
[01:11:30]  The kids are just dancing, watching the video.  Yeah.  Now it's a different one.  It's two women now, I think.  Right?  Yeah.  A girl marrying a girl?  Get those tricks up, boys.  This is going to be a good one.  Is that a girl?  Wow.  That's a little dangerous, standing on a bus.  It just fell off.  A little over six years ago.  I met a girl.  Oh, this girl's got a bunch of signs. 
[01:12:00]  You stole my heart.  I feel like I know what kind of topic this is.  It's like the first thing you do, try to pinch yourself.  The one's on a bus, but people are out, and the other one's in the window.  I love you.  You love me.  It's got Mr. Spock eyebrows.  Yeah.  Giant forehead.  Look at these fucking bobsy twins here.  They'll get married me.  How does a girl propose to a girl, and how does a guy propose to a girl? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, they're gay, too.  Kid doesn't really catch on fast, does he?  No.  They're fast learner.  They look like thithers.  I'll say yes.  Are they going to go ducking?  Where's the man put his penis with no vagina?  That was so adorable.  Was it?  All of these videos are just too cute.  Well, this is new.  That's what I want to see a lot.  They're commenting on my stand-up special.  Gay and lesbian people shouldn't be hiding.  Wait, what was that about? 
[01:13:00]  Question time.  And then question time.  Yeah, it goes on for a while.  Oh, wow.  It keeps going.  Oh, it does.  Well, let's get a couple of questions.  Let's hear a couple of questions.  Yeah.  Did both of those videos have happened in them?  Justin Bieber married a guy.  It wasn't Justin Bieber.  Two marriage proposals, both with songs.  I was really in awe of them.  Boy and a boy together, and a girl and a girl.  There's a guy proposing to a guy.  That's just crazy.  And there was a girl proposing to a girl.  That's just crazy. 
[01:13:30]  How did the videos make you feel?  Good.  Made me feel good.  It was really cool.  I was so moved by that.  I'm sad.  Gay is bad for you.  Why do you think that is bad?  I'm killing me on that kid.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  What do you think people's reactions were when they watch these videos?  It depends for certain people.  A lot of people were happy.  Really good, positive things.  I hope not negative things.  Some people must have been like rock on.  Some people were like, ew.  Some people are so anti-gay.  You don't see that every day. 
[01:14:00]  It's okay though.  Boy could like a boy or a girl could like a girl.  Most people, they would have a reaction like, it's not natural.  It's normal now.  A lot of people were upset at these marriage proposals because it was a man proposing to  a man and a woman proposing to a woman.  I don't get why anybody would be mad.  That's just wrong.  Like anyone should be able to marry anyone.  You should feel happy that they're getting married.  People that do not like gay.  He's a mustache.  Kid's got a little Hitler mustache.  He's a fucking mustache. 
[01:14:30]  What if you're a girl and your boyfriend proposes to you?  That's not different from a girl proposing to a girl.  If you want to marry the same sex, that's okay.  Just like Macklemore said.  I can't tell you.  I hate this fucking kid.  God, we hate Macklemore.  Macklemore.  You little shithead.  Indoctrination by Macklemore.  They like someone of the same gender.  Is this the overall video that was shown to kids or is this their reaction? 
[01:15:00]  No, this is the video that they showed in the classroom.  Why are they showing this?  Pause.  This word actually comes from the word.  I agree with the sentiment.  Why are you showing this and kind of telling these kids how they should be feeling?  Right.  It's way too biased in one direction.  Are they saying how they should feel?  Yeah, the video.  It's way biased to one side.  And that's why the guy apologized because there's no other side of this, really.  Then they ought to show both sides.  Now, if you want to give equal.  I think you get on the other side when you discuss it in the classroom, no?  Not really.  You don't think so?  No.  Not to that extent because the kids are obviously going to watch this and think, oh, I'm supposed 
[01:15:30]  to think, you know, kids are fucking pressure.  That's okay.  So, I'm supposed to think it's okay.  Right.  If they want to have something, they ought to have a fire and brimstone preacher give the  other side of it.  Burn in hell with your homosexuality.  Well, by the way, do they show both sides of racial issues?  Like, if they're going to show a race, do they show like where?  Yeah, I don't know what other videos they have, but the policy in this school district is to  show the other side of the argument.  And that's why the guy apologized.  Yeah, it's their policy if it's a political issue, and they said that this can be seen 
[01:16:00]  as a political issue.  Oh, okay.  Certainly.  Then I fucked me.  There you go.  So, there's today's apologies, more or less.  There's more, but.  And for the opposing side.  Now, you faggot.  What happens here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Macklemore says it's okay.  Macklemore's influencing the kids.  Then I guess it's fine if Macklemore. 
[01:16:30]  It's amazing how fast we hated that boy.  I know.  All of a sudden, he was a douche.  Well, he wasn't honest.  He wasn't really being, I don't, it didn't feel like there was honesty behind his statements.  I don't know.  That's, uh, I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck.  At that age, it's easy to, you know, you present that kind of shit.  How about, because that was too very nice.  That would be a nice proposal for anybody. 
[01:17:00]  Like, shit doesn't happen like that for the most part.  A fucking flash mob dance in a Home Depot proposal.  A girl on top of a bus with fucking signs.  So, so you look at something like that and it looks all nice and sweet.  Show these kids the fucking Halloween parade down in the village.  Let's see how fucking, let's see their eyes pop out there if they're so accepting of the  gay lifestyle.  That would be hilarious.  That's crazy!  But these proposals, that's the norm now.  Is it?  Who's the norm? 
[01:17:30]  You can't just ask a lady for your, you know, to marry you anymore.  It has to be an over-the-top presentation.  Yes, this is becoming the norm.  You gotta do a thing.  Even like, uh, just asking a girl to the prom now has to be this over-the-top thing.  Yes.  What about me?  I sucked down three captains and cokes and just kind of flung the ring at her.  Well, you should have-  I bought a ring at a train station.  I certainly did.  You should have gathered a, yeah, a mob at the subway there.  Yeah, a flash mob.  A flash mob at the, you know-  Talk me out of it.  At the train station. 
[01:18:00]  Beat me senseless.  Break my jaw so it's wired shut so I couldn't ask.  Or a bunch of youths running into a 7-Eleven to cause a problem.  Yes!  All right.  A little update on the Jay-Z fight.  TMZ paid $250,000 for the, uh, the footage.  And the guy that leaked the footage has been fired.  Yeah!  Fired!  The hotel where the infamous Jay-Z elevator attack video was recorded fired the staffer  who sold the footage to the media for big bucks. 
[01:18:30]  Well, let me tell you something.  That guy's pay was not gonna equal what he made from TMZ.  Can't they sue him, the company?  Or maybe he didn't sign anything that said that was not their property he sold?  Who knows?  $250,000 large?  Yeah.  That's the report, yo.  Standard has already terminated the individual and will now be pursuing all available civil  and criminal remedies.  The standard will next be turning over all available information to the criminal authorities.  Uh, and the employee did get, uh, 250 G's.  So, he's gonna have to pay some of that back in, in legal fees, I betcha. 
[01:19:00]  You think, yeah?  Oh, hell yeah.  He's gonna have to go to court, right?  There's gonna be a little, uh, something going on with that.  Damn.  I hope he loses every dollar they paid him.  Yes, because this is a very tricky situation.  Sets a, a bad precedent.  If, if people realize that by taking, um, private, uh, videos and audio and whatnot, you can make so much money.  Right.  It's just gonna run rampant.  Yeah.  There's gotta be some kind of a repercussions.  I hope the hotel is able to fucking sue him for a lot of money. 
[01:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  Sue everyone.  Absolutely.  Yes, my sister-in-law kicked me and hit me about the face and testicular area.  She got some good shots there.  She really did, man.  Wow.  She's a scrapper.  She knows how to fight.  Yeah.  What is she, Ratchet?  What do they say in the hood?  That chick Ratchet.  Yeah, she's Ratchet.  She's certainly more Ratchet than Beyonce.  Ratchet.  Ratchet. 
[01:20:00]  She's got some, where do they come up with these colorful words?  Ratchet-ness about her.  I need to, I need to see the picture of this next story.  The teen that says she was kicked out of the prom because some dad said her dress prompted  boys to think impure thoughts.  All right, look.  I gotta see the dress.  I see something else going on with this video.  I gotta see the dress.  If the dress ain't bad.  Turn the page.  I think they were a little mad at something else.  I've been told to turn the page.  I thought you had the story in front of you.  There's a picture of the dress.  Play the story.  It's right there.  Oh, wait.  Okay, okay. 
[01:20:30]  You're right.  That?  Yeah, but play the whole story.  She was kicked out of prom because of the dress that she was wearing.  News 4's Angie Goff is here with her outrage that's been on social media.  Angie?  Erin, a homeschooled girl's Facebook status is firing people up after she said she was  kicked out of prom because dads couldn't stop staring at her.  17-year-old Claire Edinger of Richmond wrote about her sparkly dress on her sister's blog,  explaining she was booted after dance organizers said some dads felt she was liable to cause, 
[01:21:00]  quote, impure thoughts, end quote.  Dorks.  She claims she passed the finger-length test upon entering the dance,  but soon after noticed dads on a balcony ogling and talking amongst themselves.  She says a chaperone noticed it, too, and said her dress and dancing caused men to think inappropriately about her,  so she was kicked out.  Edinger writes she felt degraded and wanted an apology.  This isn't the same story.  Edinger writes, she felt degraded and said her dress and dancing caused men to think inappropriately about her.  Look, it's in school seniors.  It's at a homeschool prom at a church. 
[01:21:30]  So it's not like a prom prom.  Homeschool kids are...  That's where the impure thoughts happened.  I saw a different video.  It was one of the links that...  It was the link that you sent me.  Travis sent me through my email.  So...  But the dress isn't that bad, right?  It's not that bad.  I wish...  Because I don't want to say anything.  I just want you to play the fucking video that I saw.  I know.  And that explains a lot.  Does explain a lot.  Oh, no. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, no.  Never too far from that, are we?  No, it's just...  Or is it something else?  No, no.  I think it's...  But the parents are the ones that...  It's not me.  Oh, no.  What's going on?  See, I got no problems.  What's going on?  Here.  Where's the video?  There it is.  Here we go.  Now we're talking.  Now we're talking.  A local teen story going viral.  Yeah.  A Chesterfield 17-year-old says she was kicked out of her prom because some adults said her 
[01:22:30]  dress and her dance moves were too provocative.  Yep.  Her parents did not want her to go on camera.  Can't these two just talk?  Why do they have to read their stories?  Oh, no.  When 17-year-old Claire posted this article on her sister's blog, the outcome wasn't what  it did and her boyfriend would have...  She went to the prom with a black guy, you see?  Okay, maybe that's part of the...  That might be part of the problem.  Maybe she was dancing with him in a way that was kind of sexy and the fucking fathers didn't  like it.  If it's in a church and the fathers are there... 
[01:23:00]  Why is D.L.  Hughley going to the prom?  I don't know.  Maybe the fathers objected.  Why is he going to the prom?  Yeah, if they're watching and they're like, you know, oh, boy, I don't like this.  How shitty.  Yeah.  She's dancing too sexy.  Get out.  What a bunch of fucking nerds.  That's a little Michael Jackson hat on.  Yeah.  Circle glasses.  Yeah, maybe it was that.  It blew up a lot faster than we thought.  The Post expresses frustration over being kicked out of an area.  He looks like the black guy that Meadow Soprano brought home. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  There's, you know...  A charcoal briquette.  A little mix going on.  Right.  A charcoal briquette.  Homeschooled prom in Hanover County over the weekend.  You know, the ditch room.  Claire couldn't go on camera.  But her boyfriend, James Thompson, who was there, says it all started when someone made  a comment that his girlfriend's dress was too short.  Claire and her boyfriend say the rule was that it had to be as long as her fingertips,  which they say was the case.  And not too long after that, James says Claire was pulled to the side and told she was dancing 
[01:24:00]  too provocatively.  Oh, was she twerking?  On Claire's blog, she wrote, quote, I hadn't been dancing at all, much less seductively.  The fathers believed that she would provoke impure thoughts in the boys.  James says Claire was eventually kicked out of the prom, and he along with others in his  group had to leave.  The main reason they said for her getting kicked out, it started with her dancing too provocatively,  and then it changed.  They went back to it being about the dress, and then we had already said that we addressed 
[01:24:30]  that.  I think it's racism.  And then they said that we were just being, we were just causing too much of a problem  and we needed to leave.  Yes, I do.  She is lily white.  It's sexism.  It's, they're saying, you're making us feel certain things, so you have to do what we  tell you to do, and it's, that's not right.  Well, he's not saying racism.  That's true.  Well, again, that's just we're reporting.  CBS 6 reached out to an organizer for the homeschool prom for comment.  Our phone calls have not been returning.  Homeschool prom.  Homeschool kids are weirdos anyway. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  She's kind of sexy, but weirdos.  But the dress isn't anything.  Yeah.  She might have been shaking that age.  She might have been doing some twerk and shaking that age.  Aw, yeah.  Yes.  Aw, yeah.  All right.  We got an update on Casey Kasem after the break.  Hi.  I don't know who I am.  Well, they found him.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know that.  Oh, they found Casey.  All right.  We'll tell you where next.  Got Rich Voss and Keith Robinson in studio. 
[01:25:30]  Good morning, boys.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Well, Rich Voss's shirt is going on.  Has anyone tweeted the picture yet?  Oh, that is fantastic.  No one has tweeted this yet?  What are we waiting for?  What?  It's a cutoff shirt.  What's the big fucking deal?  It's a cutoff.  It's early in the morning.  It's not like this is a fashion show.  You should have a head to match.  Voss is now shaped like Ric Flair. 
[01:26:00]  God damn, Rich.  You're trying to show off more tattoos, I think.  We don't give a fuck about your tattoos.  Listen, first of all, let me tell you something, half fucking healthy eater.  I just got this done yesterday.  That doesn't make sense.  Yes, because you're going to drink that and then go eat fucking food.  Am I?  I hope not.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to make it sincere.  You're starting to look really good.  Thank you.  I'm telling you, when I come in here, I go, what the fuck?  You've been working at this for a while.  Thank you. 
[01:26:30]  I go, what the fuck?  Thanks for noticing.  You know, I'm not wearing cutoff fucking shirts.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I just had this done yesterday at Immortal Inc.  You want us to see it.  He's pointing at a lobotomous scarf.  Really?  Yeah.  Attackers have a cutoff shirt.  No, Ben.  What do you think?  Because you're calculated.  You wanted us to see your new tattoo.  No, I don't want it to.  You should have just lifted up your sleeve and said, here, look, check out my new tattoo.  You wanted us to comment on your new tattoo. 
[01:27:00]  This is new.  I'm not sitting like this.  So you were sleeveless with every tat you got.  What's that?  I don't remember you being sleeveless when you got other tats.  Yeah, because they were down here.  When they were up here, I don't want the sleeve rubbing on it.  Why are you getting so many tattoos?  What's going on with you?  Yeah, what's going on?  I'm just finishing up my arm.  You used to have a couple here and there, but now it's like, you're all in.  Are you going to do your hands and your neck next?  No, no, no.  What it is, is I'm empty and I've bought everything I possibly could buy, like material, like golf clubs and clothes. 
[01:27:30]  There's two things left to buy, a stool and a rope.  And I'll loan you the money.  I'll give you the money.  You knew he was going to come out with a good one.  He leaned up on his perch and he was going to come out with a good one.  Are you calling me a bird?  I really resent that.  How was BLS this morning?  BLS?  Goddamn, Keith had the best one, though. 
[01:28:00]  He's calling you dice.  No, it's Lee.  But I'm not fat.  Oh, shit.  He's not fat anymore.  He's not?  No, he's in shape.  He's in shape.  I ordered a whore and she's dodging me.  I don't know.  I just don't like it to rub.  Yeah, yeah.  What is the tattoo of?  I still don't understand it.  This under here used to be my Star David, but I had to cover.  I'm getting this all covered.  Oh, fuck.  That's right.  That's what the Star David was. 
[01:28:30]  He's the only guy who's being Jewish and shoulders is hurt.  Why did you decide to cover up the Star David?  You can't cover up the Star David.  Holy shit.  Never forget.  That can't be good.  I'm having it redone somewhere because I didn't like the lettering.  It was too black.  It looked like I was really getting on the trains.  It looked like the Star that they put.  Right, right.  So I'm going to have it done in another area just like regular.  Where are you going to put it at?  On your back? 
[01:29:00]  Where are you going to put the Star David?  Not on your back.  You know how many guys will have to look at that?  Please don't come on my Star.  Oh, God damn.  Exactly.  Every time you come on my Star, God cries a little.  He's going to get a tramp stamp on the Star of David.  I'm going to put it on my face.  You're having a fucking midlife and gender identity crisis.  No, it's not a midlife because I've always wanted to do this. 
[01:29:30]  No, hopefully it's an end life.  Because I don't need to die.  Yeah, because that is an odd thing at your age.  What's that?  It is odd at your age to start getting all tatted up like that.  I was tatted all up here.  I know you had a few tats, which is fine.  No, the whole tops were done.  You're totally sleeved now.  Not totally.  I still got some space.  No, you're pretty much.  That's pretty much total.  You don't like to watch the tattoo?  No, it makes me angry.  But to relocate the Star of David is infuriating.  Yes.  That's what it is. 
[01:30:00]  What?  I'm a relocator.  Tattoos are supposed to be permanent.  You don't move them around.  Why would that infuriate you?  Infuriate you.  Please isolate that.  Treats his tattoos like fucking Israel treats his borders.  It was here and I was there.  You know, how many of your neighbors want you to relocate?  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  He makes a good point.  I can't even...  He makes a damn good point. 
[01:30:30]  From white to light skin.  But what is the tattoo?  Yeah, what is that one?  I don't understand what it is.  It's a flower.  I'm going to do...  That doesn't look like a flower?  No, it's a stained glass window.  That's what it is.  If you look through a stained glass window, you'll see a flower.  They're not...  That doesn't look like a flower.  They look really good.  They're very good work.  Josh at Immortal Ink in Flemington and Clinton.  That means you can just get a free tattoo, you son of a bitch.  You son of a bitch.  Where's my envelope, motherfucker? 
[01:31:00]  Give me a taste of that.  You ought to get a teardrop tattoo like your audience does on the way out.  Audience is when you work a club.  I fucking bombed so hard.  In 20 years, I did one of those alternative rooms in Brooklyn.  I did an alternative room in Brooklyn the other night.  It's like 20 people.  Were they all like hipsters? 
[01:31:30]  I swear to God.  20 people?  It's a small...  They all look alike.  It's all fucking clones.  They all had the same beard.  Like Sal, right?  They all look like fucking Sal.  They all had the same shirt like Gofie.  What's wrong with my shirt?  Nothing on you.  Is this a bad shirt?  Will you commit to something?  I'm just kidding.  What's wrong with my shirt?  What's wrong with that shirt?  Calm down, earth, wind, and fire.  I fucking...  Jesus.  I'm getting to it.  It's a slow trash.  And it's not a bad shirt for him at this point in his life. 
[01:32:00]  What's wrong with my shirt?  I've worn way worse.  It's a bad shirt, guys.  And they fucking...  I'm telling you, for 10 minutes, 20 minutes,  people were staring at me hostile, okay?  Yeah.  What joke did you start with?  Yeah, that's a good question.  How did you greet the crowd?  I said...  I'm Rich Voss.  Too easy, I know.  Sorry.  Don't give me coffee.  Look who came out of hibernation. 
[01:32:30]  You lost him at hello.  I lost him.  It was so bad.  It was so bad that when Bonnie went on, I went and sat in the car.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't want to see them.  I bet it wasn't in the garage with me running.  Too bad you didn't have a fucking barbecue.  You could come back and fuck my wife.  Oh, Jesus.  I just said Bonnie would probably prefer you dead and Patrice fucking her.  That's nice to wish somebody dead. 
[01:33:00]  I'm sorry.  Jesus, you turn from one of the best radio DJs to a listener.  I know it.  But no, you've got to take lemons to lemonade.  He was trying to not make sure you're dead, but make sure that Patrice was back.  So you take the negative and make it a positive.  Sure.  Yes, we would just prefer you.  Yeah.  Take lemons and make an eggplant.  Racist.  Oh, Christ, I'm a pony. 
[01:33:30]  No, you know.  I know.  I'm only kidding.  You're great.  First of all, the love thing.  We're friends.  There's no love.  We don't love.  You're right.  I forgot.  You don't like hugs and stuff.  He doesn't like affection at all.  He can't handle it.  He's like being touched.  Look at him.  He cringes.  It's so uncomfortable.  When people go, I love you.  I was at the hospital yesterday.  Well, if I were you, I wouldn't believe it.  Voss, I love you.  I love you, too.  We all love you.  We all love you, man.  We want you to know that.  Look, look.  He's just so crazy. 
[01:34:00]  I want to rub some of your tattoos.  His arms and he's freaking out.  You were at the hospital yesterday.  What was that about?  Oh, no.  Well, you know, you're sitting there watching your mom and she's going to pass away.  Oh, jeez.  You know, it could be two days.  It could be two weeks.  And I'm like, so the hospital.  Sorry.  What?  What happened?  So the hospital is, you know, what's going on with your mom? 
[01:34:30]  She can't swallow this and that.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My tux don't go over.  I don't care.  What happened?  Oh, is this mean?  What's wrong with my shirt again?  Nothing.  Oh, sure.  Goodbye.  Short.  Laugh at his mother dying.  Yes.  It's a nice equal balance right there.  But here's the thing.  You know, it's got to happen.  My mom's close too.  What are you going to do?  Well, it's got to happen on a Monday or Tuesday because I got my weekends.  Wait, is she really on her last days? 
[01:35:00]  I don't.  Who knows?  They said they might have to put a feeding tube in her.  You know, I don't.  And Bonnie made a good point.  But I go, who the fuck should have to live that way in a hospital just completely oblivion?  And Bonnie goes, how do you know what's going on in her head?  She might be having the best time on the planet.  I know.  Fucking.  Was it dementia?  Fucking, yeah.  Gandhi positive Canadian bitch.  Yeah.  All right.  Your mother's probably in a much better place. 
[01:35:30]  If she can't remember you're her son, it's a blessing in disguise.  Do you ever have anything nice to say?  You're just trying to tear me down to build you up.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  That's the smartest thing you ever said.  I think they can tell by testing and stuff if anything's going on in the brain.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they've got to get neurosis.  She can't swallow.  She can't swallow.  And neither can I.  It runs in the family.  That's not what crack dealers have said.  She's coming out of her, you know, it's just sad. 
[01:36:00]  How old is she?  42.  Wow.  She's 84, I think.  85.  That's a good run.  That's a good run.  That's a nice run.  If you look at it, that's a very good run.  Well, because you guys come from sickle cell.  Sickle cell?  Whoa.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Boston in 1971.  Fucking.  You guys come from sickle cell.  You guys come from smallpox.  Hey.  Rich Sterling.  I've never known one black person with sickle cell. 
[01:36:30]  No.  Because you don't know any black people.  You've also never known one black person without it.  Okay.  Like you really talk to your help.  Wow.  Wow.  This show is getting racist.  Oh, what is that going on?  It's just vicious.  Rick came to play.  Oh, it's so vicious.  What do you do to prepare for this?  Holy shit.  What do you do to prepare for this?  I punched myself in the face all day.  What?  I punched myself in the face all night. 
[01:37:00]  I'm like, someone's cock.  You put your fist and just start banging it against you.  All right.  We got it, Jim.  No.  I'm going to get a pleasure to do that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  My God.  Damn.  Makes me feel alive.  That end-of-life shit is just.  It's terrible.  And you know what it gets me?  Like, I left there yesterday, the hospital, and I had to go get to it.  And I go, I feel horrible.  I'm leaving her in the hospital to go get a tattoo.  Right?  But.  I'm going to cover up the star of David, no less.  Yeah.  Yeah, tonight.  Man. 
[01:37:30]  So.  But, you know, who just sits there watching?  I never understood that.  It's so hard.  Yeah.  Like, remember when we got Patrice's mom out of the hospital and took her out to eat?  Yeah.  We had a great time, you know, just to get her fucking mind off of what was going on.  We sat for like an hour in the diner that day, and we had.  Yeah, you could just dwell on that shit.  Right.  Oh, fuck, man.  Yeah, just to sit there, it is difficult.  You got to get out of the fucking place.  You got to get out of the hospital.  It's fucking hospital. 
[01:38:00]  When you go there for your medicine, like, you don't have to stay, right?  No, I get to leave, bro.  You could turn those brown tattoos into things.  Like, they could put stuff around it.  I think you mean, I have a couple of beauty marks that Rich is referring to.  You're talking about the AIDS sarcoma.  You're talking about the AIDS sarcoma.  You're talking about the AIDS sarcoma.  Right.  Or that.  He's got AIDS.  AIDS.  Magic Johnson AIDS.  He's got AIDS.  He's got the AIDS.  What is he doing?  Do we have that?  He's walking around.  He gets on to try to, like, bolster his image and apologize. 
[01:38:30]  He made it ten times worse.  You think he's a racist or just very ignorant?  What did he do?  Donald Sterling.  He's talking about Magic Johnson, who's like a national treasure.  Right.  To some.  To some.  Yeah, not if you're a Knicks fan.  No national treasure to me.  So what did he do?  He did a thing with Anderson Cooper, right?  Yeah, he went on with Anderson Cooper and he's talking about Magic.  And then he's just bashing Magic Johnson for no fucking reason.  Saying that he doesn't do enough for the black community. 
[01:39:00]  Meanwhile, Magic Johnson's been very charitable to the black community.  Very charitable.  Is that what they said at the meetings?  We have to focus on Magic.  Magic Johnson.  Very charitable.  So, but here's the thing with Donald Sterling.  He's so rich.  He can just go, why don't you guys all go fuck yourselves?  Well, I'll do what I want.  He's not really taking that.  He's not doing that.  That's the thing.  Yeah.  No, I was with him at first when the private, what you're on your phone.  Initially, right. 
[01:39:30]  I was like, I'm with this dude.  Yeah.  He's on his phone.  He should say what he has to say.  Right.  And that's good.  I don't give a damn.  We all say messed up shit on the phone.  Yeah.  But now he's got an interview.  He has his chance to redeem himself.  And he's going worried.  He's horrible.  He fucked it up so bad.  You know what it is, too?  You could say he's got money and everything like that.  But to be just publicly just exiled, you're exiled from the civilized world.  He's looked at as a fucking, you know, persona non grata anywhere he goes.  And people don't like that. 
[01:40:00]  I would like for him, I wish he would show up at the games and just try to high five and play.  Holy shit.  He'd try to fist bump him.  Could you imagine the ovation he'd get?  Holy fuck.  I think he should come in blackface.  Wow.  To show him that he cares.  Now that would be interesting.  He does a little Al Jolson out on the floor.  See, I'm down.  A little Bojangles out on the fucking floor.  I think, and a lot of housewives with him.  Oh, shit.  I think with good reason, I think with good reason, I think blacks. 
[01:40:30]  Blacks?  I'm your friend.  I think the blacks.  It's the blacks.  I think colored.  I think they dislike whites more than whites dislike blacks.  Do you think, I mean, overall in general.  You don't listen to this radio show, do you?  Do you think that, do you think, I mean.  I think we hate white guys dressed like gas attendants. 
[01:41:00]  Why?  Because you don't have cars.  Wow.  That was hurtful.  Watch me make rich.  Get up.  Fill it full of regular dummies.  Is that what you call cum now?  Oh, fuck this. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, sweet God.  Oh, this is just evil.  Us three did a fucking pilot that wasn't picked up.  See what they fucking could have had?  Dummies.  You're damn right.  AIDS and racist jokes.  How could they pass on this?  Teasing each other's fucking sickle cell jokes and making fun of our clothes?  The club squad.  That would have worked, man.  They would have called our show canceled.  Why? 
[01:42:00]  Why, Rich?  Why do you have to make it hip and insider, Rich?  Is our guest here?  No.  Damn it.  You're not here soon?  We're not guests.  I don't know how you guys are.  So, what are you plugging for Kevin?  What does Keith have going on?  Keith is taping a one-hour stand-up special.  Fuck yeah.  Which is great, man.  I've seen the material.  It's fucking fantastic.  It's at the Gramercy Theater.  And it's a live taping, obviously, two shows here in New York. 
[01:42:30]  And it's May 30th.  May 30th, man.  Here in the city.  Two sweet shows.  Two weeks from Friday.  Yeah, 7 and 10 p.m.  Gramercy.  Where can they get tickets?  Just Ticketmaster?  Ticketmaster.  Or go to ComedianKeithRobinson.com.  These shows will sell out.  What's that?  Fuck it.  Go ahead.  I want to hear it.  No, I touch it.  Take a swing, man.  I see you wrap up.  You got your Yankees shirt on.  I'm digging in. 
[01:43:00]  That's it.  Oh, fuck this room.  Nah, nah.  Put your visors on so the sun don't get in your way.  It's just...  At the end of your hour, you're going to say, and now, Wanda Sykes?  Wow.  Why, Rich?  Why, man?  Rich.  Why, you got...  Shut up.  Don't fucking turn on me.  Nobody's turning on you.  You're turning on yourself with those horrible comebacks.  That's just not nice.  And we started one out of three isn't bad.  One out of three?  Still gets you in the Hall of Fame.  Almost.  Yeah.  Two out of three gets you in the Hall of Fame? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, well, certainly that would, yes.  Sometimes one.  Of course.  Yeah, sometimes one.  One out of three gets you in the Hall of Fame.  I can't fucking believe that this weekend at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse, I get to  work with Bonnie, both of us co-headlining at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse.  And then next Tuesday, Norton, we're doing our live podcast.  Hold on, though.  What?  Your mom's going to die on a Tuesday.  That's what happens.  Then we have some more stuff to talk about.  All right.  You're going to be pissed off.  If she dies on Tuesday, we're not going to bury her the same day.  You want her to die on a Monday or a Tuesday. 
[01:44:00]  You bury her the next day, don't you?  Yeah, isn't that quick with you?  That's some next day stuff, huh?  You just get ready.  Absolutely.  Put the house up for sale immediately.  They don't fuck around.  And the other people in the nursing home will be mad.  I'm guest marriage counselor for Rich and his victim at the Village Underground, which I'm  actually looking forward to next Tuesday.  I'm so happy I can do that.  Yeah, it's going to be a lot.  It's going to be fucking fun Tuesday.  Bobby's producing it.  Oh.  When did Bobby become this...  I've had enough of Bobby. 
[01:44:30]  He's a mogul.  He's a media mogul now.  I couldn't even say that word.  It's like an internet mogul.  Yeah, he's a big mover and shaker, as they say.  Bonnie is an ordained minister now, so he can marry people.  Bobby?  Yeah, he took a test.  He's an ordained minister.  Didn't he say Bonnie?  I thought he said Bonnie.  Bobby.  Did he just say Bobby or Bobby?  He said Bonnie.  I said Bobby.  Shut up.  I said Bobby.  Travis, do you play it back?  You wanted to say Bobby, but your mouth...  It sounded like...  Yeah, who knows?  Yeah, what happens to words in that fucking dopey mouthy or something? 
[01:45:00]  Words of his brain form fine, and then as they begin to come out of the mouth, all of  a sudden, a fire alarm goes off, and they panic, and they bump into his teeth and trip  over his tongue, and they just fall out in any order they want.  Not in an orderly fashion.  No.  Stop looking at me and thinking.  What'd he say?  I can hear him thinking.  I can hear him thinking.  Can we hear it?  Yeah.  Can we hear it?  It says Bobby.  Okay.  Yeah, he's a big mover and shaker, as they say. 
[01:45:30]  Bonnie is an ordained minister.  Oh, I said Bonnie.  See?  You did.  Rest our case.  Well, because they both have tips.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Not at all.  Oh, and she gets best for that.  I've been here.  And so is Bobby.  Yes.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's just brutal.  Wow.  Wow.  That's just brutal. 
[01:46:00]  Geez.  Is that upset?  That's not at all.  Are you kidding me?  Bonnie came in the other day with her.  You know how they have the t-shirt on and you can see the nipples through it?  Yeah.  I got so excited and I'm trying to fuck her, but I didn't take a pill.  So it's so hard to fuck a girl when you're not hard and she's dry.  Okay?  Your genitals can't.  Neither one of your genitals can lie.  It's like two north ends of a magnet. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, I'm spitting on it.  Just basically talking over it.  Beat everyone to that part.  Nice.  You think we were all going to make fun of this?  Oh, man.  You two still active sex life?  I mean, I don't know what you'd call active.  It's once a year active.  Yeah, you know, a couple times.  How often?  Would you say?  Probably once every two weeks.  Once every two weeks?  That's kind of a married thing.  Once every two weeks.  That is kind of a married thing, you know? 
[01:47:00]  But if you had Viagra or Cialis, wouldn't it help?  Yeah, no, it doesn't help your fucking mind or your, you know, your want to do it.  The word he's looking for is libido.  Right.  Your mind.  Your want.  Yeah, you go.  I feel like I'm playing charades.  Libido.  So, I mean, it depends.  You know, she'll say to me, she'll go, can I just blow you to get it over with, you know? 
[01:47:30]  Get it over with.  Holy shit.  Did you guys get it done or what?  Yeah, man, we fucked.  You know, I mean, we don't kiss.  No, I mean, the other day when your genitals weren't cooperating.  Yeah, you don't kiss or anything?  How did it get...  Why would I do that?  Kiss?  You guys sound like we're newlyweds.  Do you guys ever make out on the couch?  What, say that again?  What, say, do we make out on the couch?  No. 
[01:48:00]  Why?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, fuck.  Ugh.  I tried.  The other day when she was looking sexy, I started kissing her and she goes, get your  fucking tongue out of my mouth.  Wow.  Wow.  But, you know, we used to...  When I first met her, I used to make out with her and stuff.  Sure.  You know.  You've told us.  And then that shit completely wears off.  You know what I mean?  Fucking marriage.  But she makes me laugh.  Yes, sucks.  You know, the thing is, we like the same TV shows.  We like the same snacks. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, that's good.  And we come together when we're both attacking somebody at the same time.  So that's what keeps it fresh.  We can find the same...  You gotta have sex, man.  Yeah.  What are you talking about that keeps it fresh?  How about some sex?  Well, what...  Calm down.  There's no way.  When you get married, you're fucking sacrificing something that's just amazing.  That thrill, the fucking...  You throw it away for this thing that, like...  He doesn't know.  His cult and his culture, they start, like, when they're 13, to start uneducated. 
[01:49:00]  You know it's bad when Voss is calling people uneducated.  Please tell me Voss didn't just say uneducated.  Uneducated.  I said educated.  He's thinking about engines in that outfit.  Yeah, we really don't like your outfit at all.  You're dressed like Bobby Cannavale in Blue Jasmine.  That's a good reference.  Yes, I saw the movie.  He was very good in it.  Well acted. 
[01:49:30]  Dice was good in the movie.  Dice was in it, too.  He was great.  Our guest is on his way up, which is very nice.  Oh, nice.  We met him once.  Jimmy hasn't met him yet.  I met him.  Enough with this fake fucking army guy.  You've met him?  You've met him, yeah.  I got his autograph.  Where?  Last time he was in studio.  Wait, you were in that day?  Yeah, when he came.  That was over...  That was many years ago.  That was over across the street.  At least five, six years ago.  You guys were doing good then, when he was in.  That's hurtful. 
[01:50:00]  That's not hurtful.  You guys are...  Are you kidding me?  He's in Army.  You're probably...  Right?  Who say it?  I'm saying you're probably the most respected radio host in the business.  Every radio host talks about you.  That's wonderful.  That's true.  You don't like being respected by your peers?  Who talks about us?  Tell us.  What do they say?  Yeah, and what do they say?  What are some of the nice things they say?  There you go.  We listen to them all the time.  I mean, they're usually, like, the producers or the assistants.  Uh-huh.  Wow, that's great.  No, the sports junkies love you guys. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, we like those guys.  Well, why don't you look at Jim while you're saying that?  You're just looking at Jim.  Yeah.  Because he...  Here he comes.  Here he is.  Arlie Ermey.  Because Jim's at a whole other level then.  I mean, they've still got quite a presence about him as he walks down the hallway.  How old is this guy now?  Wherever he goes.  He's got to be 40.  He's got to take your seat.  I'll look it up real fast.  Arlie.  Yeah, you can move over.  Ermey.  Rich, I think you've got to bounce over one.  Sorry.  Move, stupid.  It's like the Tonight Show, you know? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  You move.  There he is.  Arlie Ermey.  Gunny.  Gunny.  God damn, Arlie Ermey.  You're looking great.  Pleasure to see you again, sir.  You are looking fantastic, sir.  He looks like the sergeant from Stripes.  What?  How are you doing?  Rich Voss.  That's Rich Voss.  That's comic standing BET.  Oh, jeez.  That's Private Snowball.  Private.  What's going on, Arlie?  All right.  Good to have you back. 
[01:51:30]  Whoa.  Fantastic to have you back.  You were here quite a while ago.  And look at you.  He looks fantastic.  What the hell?  You look great, Arlie.  What are you doing?  You still a lot of PT?  What are you doing?  I do.  I go out and run a little bit.  I like to, I'll watch, tune in O'Reilly Factor, and I'll get on the treadmill, and that's  my hour.  Oh, a little O'Reilly.  So it's good.  There you go.  I get educated. 
[01:52:00]  I hear you.  Find out what's going on in the world and stay fit.  See what's going on?  Halfway decent, anyway.  It gets harder as you go.  It doesn't Riley up?  You don't look at the TV and go, what the hell is going on with this world?  I'm pretty burned up about the veterans, the treatment of the veterans.  At the VA hospitals?  Yeah, the Veterans Administration.  Unbelievable.  The boys up on the hill.  You know whose fault that is.  It's not the little underfunded hospital's fault, for Pete's sakes.  Right.  It's the funders.  It's the people up there.  I believe they call them the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
[01:52:30]  And you know, if you want to point fingers, that's the guy.  He's the boss.  He's the one.  It always goes uphill.  You've got to look at the top to see who's supposed to be responsible for this.  Any of the veterans that are treated like that, having to wait for medical attention  at these VA hospitals, it's unconscionable.  You can't even fathom that that happens in this country.  And we don't want anything free.  We just want what was promised to us, our contract.  And we've shed blood for this country, and we expect the other end to hold up their end 
[01:53:00]  of the deal.  But you know, there was a time a few years back when we were all extremely proud of our  Veterans Administration and our Veterans Hospitals.  But now they're so underfunded.  Let's face it, this war's been going on for how many years now?  Yeah, quite a few.  And so their workload has doubled and crippled and quadrupled.  And the budget just hasn't kept it.  What are they not giving them if they're supposed to give them treatment?  Treatment? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, they're supposed to keep them alive.  We had 40-some of them die waiting.  Waiting for treatment.  That's horrible.  Do you blame a lot of it on our president now?  You know what?  I don't want to go there because that's not my place.  But what I will say is, you know, the Veterans are joining together.  We're banding together.  There's a lot of American Veterans in this country.  And in November, our voice will be heard.  Trust me on that.  But anyway, hey guys, I'm releasing a new show on the Sportsman Channel. 
[01:54:00]  And it's called Saving Private K-9.  Saving Private K-9.  It's about working dogs.  It's about military dogs.  Dogs that serve in combat.  Dogs, police, military and police dogs.  And, you know, it's service dogs.  And this is America.  We love our dogs in America.  Yes, we do.  Is there anybody in this room that doesn't own a dog?  Aren't they amazing, too? 
[01:54:30]  You don't like dogs?  I had a friend tell me the other day.  He doesn't like dogs.  I've had a lot of bad experiences with dogs.  My dog was stolen.  I had a German Shepherd.  Especially the working dog.  I had a guy tell me the other day.  Keith doesn't like the working dogs.  Yes.  We have Michael Vick in the corner here.  Let's talk to him about that.  We call it the peanut butter incident.  I had a buddy of mine tell me the other day.  He said, you lock your wife and your dog in the trunk of the car.  Sure.  Let him stay in there an hour and then let him out. 
[01:55:00]  See who's happy to see you.  Oh, wow.  That makes a lot of sense.  Yes, for sure.  They are quite amazing.  We've seen a lot of the police dogs here at work in Manhattan.  I don't like them.  I don't like the police dogs.  Can they growl immediately?  You know, bomb-sniffing dogs, drug-sniffing dogs, walking down the sidewalks, checking the  truck.  And what they can be taught.  I'm a dog.  How they can be trained, and then the affection they have for their masters. 
[01:55:30]  It's really amazing to watch.  And the thought is, why send a human being in to risk his life into a building to take  down the bad guy when we can send a dog in and he's more efficient?  I mean, how many soldiers do you know that run inside the building and grab the perpetrator  and bite him?  Yeah.  None of them, right?  Boy, the old dog shows.  He does.  The dogs do that.  It's a psychological effect that dogs have.  Now, we, in a couple of our shows, we've had these working dog and this handler be in 
[01:56:00]  a Humvee or something, and IED hit them, and they're wounded, and the dog gets medevaced  one way, and the handler gets medevaced the other way.  The handler spends five years looking for his dog because he can't find his dog, and there's  a love affair.  The dog has saved this guy's life two or three times in combat.  And we bring them together.  We find the dog, and we will reunite those two. 
[01:56:30]  And I'm in the room with the dog and his old ex, his old handler, his old owner, and  I look over at my camera guy, and there's tears streaming down the street.  Jeez.  My sound guy's over there with a big box of Kleenex.  He's got a pile of Kleenex.  What are you working for?  Got to get a new crew.  Bunch of pussies.  What are you working for the Bravo Network?  It's all I can do.  It's very emotional.  You know, a man and his dog is very emotional, and it's hard for me to maintain my composure. 
[01:57:00]  But I have a question.  And I'm pretty hardcore.  I have a question.  There's people, though, that are such animal rights activists that would be against sending  dogs into a building, that would rather send humans into a building, and which I think  they're a little extreme, some of those animal rights activists.  A little?  I know.  I know.  Those are the same nitwits that don't want to send a UAV in to bomb the bad guys.  They want to send a human being in so that the human being can die. 
[01:57:30]  You know, I don't have too much use for some of those uninformed, uneducated losers in this world.  I just don't have any use for them.  And if they were sitting right here in front of me, I would tell them that I have no use  for them.  So shame on them.  Hey, how do we find the Sportsman Channel?  We're going to go to sportsmanchannel.com.  Sportsmanchannel.com.  And feed your zip code in there, and it'll tell you what channel to go to. 
[01:58:00]  I have Fios, and I get it where I am, so I'll be watching that.  And also, with new smart teeth.  My grandfather from World War I.  Then why are you wearing it?  Huh?  What are you doing wearing your grandfather's hair?  Yeah, from World War I.  The all-round dog tag.  That's cool.  That's how we connect.  But he fought for Germany.  The show is on tonight at 8.30.  Okay, we'll find it.  Tonight at 8.30.  8.30 Eastern time.  Yeah.  And we're showing two shows back-to-back. 
[01:58:30]  So it's a great time for you to come on board with us and judge whether you're going to  like the show or not.  I can't imagine anybody not liking the fact of watching dogs, loyal dogs, working for the  soldiers and police in this country.  Amazing.  I just say, give us a fair chance.  Absolutely.  I think the show is amazing.  I've been working on the show now for just short of a year.  Right.  And I tell you, it's a heart stringer.  This thing is, you get emotional.  There's every emotion you could imagine. 
[01:59:00]  So I think this show is going to be a blockbuster.  I've liked everything you've done.  You pop up on TV all the time.  I loved Mail Call and all the other shows you've been on.  You're always very interactive with the military on these shows.  And they let you drive tanks and fly in helicopters.  Mail Call was great.  I had fun doing Mail Call.  And my thought...  Jimmy likes Mail Call, but it's a different, whole different subject. 
[01:59:30]  She Mail Call.  He's implying that I'm not gay at all.  No, he's thrilled.  Of course not.  Of course not.  She Mail Call.  I'm not gay at all.  But when he takes a picture with you...  Of course not.  I have mine.  And all I say, if you're gay, that's just that much more for me, buddy.  That's the way you think twice, man.  Well, Jim says it in reverse. 
[02:00:00]  If you're not gay, it's just more for me, buddy.  I'm not gay.  But you, of course not.  Am I gay?  I just like ladies with a little extra.  Oh, my God.  What is Arlie thinking?  You've got to give the show up.  That's the show.  That's the show.  He's not starting to think I'm a non-Howard Stearns.  No, he's not a good guy.  He has listeners.  Goddamn, Rich.  Doesn't say a lot for you. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, exactly, Rich.  Arlie's great because he knows what his mission is.  Absolutely.  And he goes in and that's his job.  I am absolutely stolen to them.  They're just teasing me.  I was trying to keep you guys on point.  On point.  Let's ask Arlie.  What do you think of a lady that has just a little extra?  A little extra.  Girls with penises a lot of times.  Oh, really?  Yeah, a little extra.  They're delightful, you know.  Don't ask, don't tell.  As I said, I'm not one to judge. 
[02:01:00]  Right.  We all need to look at this.  It's okay.  Just a little extra, you know.  Jim likes to improvise, adapt, overcome.  Absolutely.  As long as there's more of the kind I like, there's more left over at the end of the day.  There's no problem with that, right?  As long as there's a senior race.  Can I ask a Full Metal Jacket question?  Yeah.  How was Kubrick to you?  Oh, I loved Kubrick.  Kubrick was a wonderful guy.  His only, the reason a lot of actors couldn't get along with Kubrick was because he made them perform. 
[02:01:30]  He made them rise to his level.  Or it was not acceptable.  You would do it over again.  How many, how many, you want to know what makes him perform?  Pull down your zipper.  Jesus, wow.  That's a well-respected man here.  Just a little extra.  A little extra.  Sportsman channel, come on.  So we've got to measure up here.  Right, measure up.  So he would expect a lot out of those guys.  How many takes? 
[02:02:00]  He's legendary for making you guys do the same scene over and over again.  Most takes I ever did was seven.  Awesome, man.  That's easy.  I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the senior drill instructor.  That big walk around the barrier.  Sure, that's a one shot right there.  The most dialogue of anybody and most movement, constant movement.  Right.  It was seven takes.  Then you've got these guys, these actors that will go on, good morning, America.  Admit to 36 million housewives that it took them 40 takes to rise to the occasion.  To rise to Stanley Kubrick's standard, shame on them. 
[02:02:30]  That's all I can.  Wow.  Yes.  Because that is a long dialogue that you have right there.  Do you still remember it?  Oh, yes.  Of course.  Of course.  Were you saying that before in the movie?  Do you want to hear it?  I'd do it in about 10 seconds.  Oh, yeah.  Could you do it to Rich Voss?  And I can do it.  I can do it without the swear words.  No, use the swear words.  You can swear if you want.  I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I am your senior drill instructor.  From now on, you will speak only when spoken to.  The first and last word out of your filthy sewers will be, sir.  Do you maggots understand that? 
[02:03:00]  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Both feathers, I can't hear you.  Sound off like you have a pair.  If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon.  You will be a minister of death praying for war.  But until that day, you are pukes.  You are scumbags.  You are the lowest form of life on earth.  You are not even human beings.  You are nothing but a lot of little unorganized grabasty pieces of civilian poop.  Shit.  Well, you know, there could be kids, Liz.  Yeah, we hope so. 
[02:03:30]  Probably not.  You know their parents would never talk like that.  Their parents don't talk to them anyhow.  Did you start off, I mean, did you go to acting class and stuff, or did you just write into it?  No, I played cowboys when I was a little boy.  And I used to always be the bad guy.  Oh, yeah.  You see, so I had all the practice in the world.  I grew up on a farm in Kansas.  The nearest neighbors were about a mile away, so we had no one to play with. 
[02:04:00]  I had five brothers.  Oh, okay.  That was my playmates were my brothers.  We were one year apart.  And we would play cowboys all the time.  Yeah.  And so that was my practice time.  And then when I went in the Marine Corps, I was an instructor most of the time.  So, you know, I'm standing up on the stage, and I'm addressing a thousand recruits.  And there is a certain persona you have to put on, right?  You basically have to be a stand-up comedian in order to maintain the control. 
[02:04:30]  Well, there's none of them here.  So, anyway, after I got in the Marine Corps, retired me out in 1972 out of Vietnam.  And I was standing outside.  I had almost 12 years in.  And I found myself standing outside of the gate of the Marine Corps crit depot in San Diego thinking, what?  All I owned in the world was in that sea bag, that little green bag.  I didn't even have a car.  So, I called my wife's purse.  What the hell am I going to do now? 
[02:05:00]  I wrote a script, and I went up to Hollywood, and I did some of the comedy clubs.  You did?  Yeah, I did that for a while.  You were doing stand-up?  Yeah, I did stand-up.  Nobody heckled me.  I'll guarantee you that.  You will laugh at me.  No, you will laugh.  That's right.  You will laugh.  You will not cry.  You over there in the corner.  Why are you not laughing?  But then I went to Okinawa, Japan, and I opened a couple of bars up.  So, right outside the Marine Base. 
[02:05:30]  Wow, yeah.  Then I heard they were going to start doing Vietnam War shows.  So, I went in the Philippines and met the right people.  And just everything fell into place.  I say it's God's will.  You were in Apocalypse Now.  In Apocalypse Now.  Yeah, you were one of the copter guys.  I was a helicopter pilot.  I was number two technical advisor.  And a technical advisor.  And then Boys in Company C?  Boys in Company C.  I went to work on Boys in Company C right after I finished Full Metal Jacket. 
[02:06:00]  Or right after I finished Apocalypse Now.  Apocalypse.  Sidney J. Fury directed that movie.  And that was my big break.  You had a big part in that one.  I had a nice part in that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Were you in Brokeback Mountain?  What?  What?  Wow.  What the hell, man?  No, no, no.  You bombed at that alt club.  It was you.  I think there was talk about me being in Brokeback Mountain.  But they decided to put me in Saving Silverman instead.  That was kind of an unusual role for me. 
[02:06:30]  Because that was the role.  I got it up there.  And they give you a description of the character.  It's that of a gay, homicidal high school football coach.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, hell, I had never played a gay, homicidal high school football coach.  So I took this as kind of a challenge.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  And you basically don't even realize that I'm a gay, homicidal high school football coach  until the very end of the movie.  Until, yeah.  When I married Jack Black.  That's right.  And let me tell you right up front, Jack Black is not a good kisser. 
[02:07:00]  And there was no tongue involved.  Very good.  But we don't reach around either.  But we know who the top was, don't we?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Anyway, it's Saving Private K9.  Yes, yes.  Back on point.  Back on point.  Is it on tonight?  It's on tonight.  Day 30 tonight.  Don't miss it.  I'm telling you, go to the Sportsman Channel website, sportsmanchannel.com, and just feed 
[02:07:30]  your, what do you call it, zip code information in there.  And you'll find out where the channel is.  It'll tell you exactly what channel you've got to.  Arlie, we've got phone calls.  It's in to get proof.  We've got to get to.  We've got to get to Jason in D.C.  Some great calls coming in.  All right.  Go ahead, Jason.  Hey, Arlie, I could talk full metal jacket all day long, but I had a quick question about  your experience with working with Chevy Chase and what a lot of actors think he's a dick  to work with.  I was just curious about your experience with Chevy.  Well, I'm just going to have to say that a lot of actors are right. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, is there anyone that will say a nice thing about Chevy?  I don't think so.  Wow.  Wow.  Who saw that?  Oh, boy.  That's a good one.  Okay, there's your answer, sir.  All right.  Wow.  He was a dick, huh?  He's very difficult to get along with, I've heard, from many, many people.  We had an episode with him when we were doing a talk show with him.  We sure did.  And he was just, yeah.  He wouldn't say hi to us.  Kind of an asshole.  Even though we said hi to him.  You're kidding, right?  As we're all getting our makeup done at the same time. 
[02:08:30]  I really never, ever had any problem with Chevy, but I've encountered people who have.  Yeah.  You know, as far as I'm concerned, he was an absolute gentleman with me.  I worked with him for a couple of weeks.  You're a class act, Arlie.  You're a class act.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hi, Arlie.  I wanted to ask you, I heard that Stanley Kubrick had no plans of putting you in a full metal jacket  and didn't know who you were until you randomly sent in a video of you screaming insults for five minutes,  which made him decide to put you in it. 
[02:09:00]  Is there any truth wrong?  Well, I can honestly say you heard absolutely wrong.  Oh.  I talked to Stanley Kubrick.  He hired me as technical advisor.  I had read the novel that The Short Timers by Gustav Hasford that the film was based upon, the screenplay was based on.  And I was reading the book for the second time when Kubrick called me, and he asked me if I would like to be his technical advisor.  And I told him there's a lot of things wrong with the novel. 
[02:09:30]  So he got me over there.  And my objective when I – it was film number five for me, guys.  And I had gone on films as technical advisor, and every single one of them I ended up with a role.  So I went over to get the role of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I accepted the job as technical advisor simply to get my foot in the door.  There was no video sent anywhere.  I went over in person. 
[02:10:00]  I had to train – knowing that I have to train all of the background extras, I have to teach them drill.  I have to teach them manual at arms with a rifle and a sword.  I have to teach them how to march.  I have to teach them basically how to be Marine recruits.  So Kubrick had to watch me, didn't he?  Uh-huh.  So he watched you and said, why are we going to cast somebody else?  Well, already casted.  It was casted already.  Oh, it was.  However, I made him watch me, and I put it on video that me grilling the recruits, the background extras. 
[02:10:30]  The next day, he called me into the office and said, yeah, I know what you're –  I know what you're pulling.  I had asked him if I could audition for the role earlier.  He said, no, no, I've got a Hollywood actor that I've all got lined up, got a contract with.  Who was it?  Who was the guy?  You know, I don't want to mention who it was.  It's not right for me.  After all these years.  But I have got him several nice jobs since. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Paul Rubens, actually, it was.  It was going to be a – no?  Pee-wee Herman.  Oh.  That made it worse.  Yeah, it really did.  I got to ask you, the scene where you smack D'Onofrio in the face a couple of times –  Never touched him.  No, no, I didn't.  I didn't hit him.  I didn't hit him at all.  When you watch that, it really comes across as you smacking him in the face.  Vince and I worked on this very hard to slap.  When I come across with the right hand, I would just barely tick his nose. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  And flip the top of his hat with my fingertips.  When I come back across the other way, it was just – it was –  Well, that's one of the greatest gags ever caught on film because that looks like you smack him very hard.  Well, Vince was very, very effective on his responses.  He's quick and really good.  Now, the slap where I slapped Private Joker, I actually had to slap Private Joker and he asked me to. 
[02:12:00]  I didn't do it on – he asked me to slap him because he was having a little trouble responding.  Oh, wow.  So he needed that.  And so I did slap Private Joker, but only at his request.  And I did not slap him very hard.  Right.  I didn't want to break anything.  So I did lay hands on Private Joker.  However, he asked Private Mr. Vincent, De Honor Frio.  We worked on that, and Vincent had great reflexes. 
[02:12:30]  There was no question about it.  Stanley Kubrick even thought that I actually slapped him.  Wow, really?  Matter of fact, when we got lined up to do the shot, Stanley told me, Lee, I've never seen a fake slap that ever has impressed me.  You might have to really slap him.  Really smack him.  Vincent looked down on me, and Vince's a big man.  Yeah.  Vince's like six foot five.  And he looked down at me, and he said, you better not slap me.  Holy shit.  Oh, he didn't want to be slapped. 
[02:13:00]  No.  Wow.  Now, why should he?  Yeah, yeah.  We worked on it.  I mean, Kubrick, after we did this, we did it one time.  And as soon as we finished the slap scene, Kubrick jumped off the camera car and ran up to Vince to find out if he was all right.  Wow.  So do you think it was effective?  Yes, of course.  He was right there.  And Leon Vitale, who is Stanley Kubrick's right-hand man, was sitting there, and as I came across with the right, he clapped his hands. 
[02:13:30]  And when I came back across with the left, he clapped his hands again.  So it gave it that sound of flesh on flesh.  That's amazing.  And Kubrick, I don't know, probably went to his grave thinking that I actually slapped Benson.  And that was a great way to show left and right, by the way.  Very effective.  Very effective way.  Very effective way.  That's how you should teach your children, left and right.  It never failed.  I'm the guy that says, let the little turd touch the stove. 
[02:14:00]  You know?  I'll teach him.  He'll learn something, man.  If you sit there and tell him, don't touch that stove, well, he's going to be over there screwing with that stove until he drives you nuts.  You know that, right?  If he burns himself.  Let the little shit go ahead and touch it.  I love it.  Put your finger in that fan.  Go ahead.  Absolutely.  Get into a car with a stranger.  It's the only way to learn.  One more thing I wanted to ask you, I was curious about on Apocalypse Now, the helicopter scenes, obviously no CGI back then. 
[02:14:30]  Did you ever feel, and you've been in some shit before, but did you ever feel that you were in danger during those filmings?  Because it's such an unbelievable, erratic scene with those copters and demolition going off.  You always feel that, you know, there's safer places to be.  Like playing on the freeway in L.A.  I'm a firm believer that I shoot high-powered rifles, right? 
[02:15:00]  And I'm a firm believer that the safest damn place in the world to be is on the firing line of a rifle qualification.  Right, right.  Not if you're one of him.  Because we, we, we, it's all about safety, man.  It's all about safety.  Enough of this, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's more dangerous driving a car down the freeway in L.A. than it is to be on the rifle range when there's 100 people shooting at the same time.  Absolutely.  I've been trying to convince the anti-gun people that we need to be able to protect ourselves. 
[02:15:30]  I feel vulnerable.  I'm in, I'm in the, when I jump on the airplane, I can't carry my hand.  Exactly.  And now I'm at the mercy of anybody who wants to approach me on the street and try to get cute with me.  I think that.  I'm at the mercy of those people.  The Second Amendment is very clear, and I don't know how it's been bastardized and twisted around.  We should have the right.  The right to keep and bear arms.  What part of that do you need to be in the airplane?  Yes, shall not be infringed.  Exactly.  It says it right there. 
[02:16:00]  And we should have the right to protect ourselves in any way, in our family, in any way we deem fit to the best of our abilities.  And, you know, it really evens the playing ground when you're able to carry a weapon.  You should be able to protect this 19-year-old girl anyway.  Okay, in lieu of family, I will say.  Look, Texas passed a law right to carry, right?  Yes.  Crime went down by 50% overnight.  Who's going to approach you on the street and rob you? 
[02:16:30]  They think you might be packing.  Legislating against the people that pay attention to the rules does nothing as far as gun safety goes.  Exactly.  Because no one that is going to commit a crime with a gun is going to pay attention to how many rounds they allow in a magazine or how many guns you're able to carry on you, where you're able to carry.  They don't pay attention to that shit.  What they do is they put people in positions where, accidentally, they can now become criminals by not adhering to the numerous new rules that are put in place. 
[02:17:00]  And then you, as a law-abiding citizen, go out with eight rounds in your magazine instead of the legal seven, and now you're a criminal.  See, he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Guns kill.  No!  When it's really the simplest thing in the world, you have the right to carry, you have the right to keep and bear firearms.  Exactly.  You shall not be infringed upon.  You shall not be infringed.  That's the only rule we need, isn't it?  I have never seen a more ill-informed group, also, than the anti-gun people as far as guns go. 
[02:17:30]  They know nothing about guns, about gun mechanics, about gun laws.  They are some of the most misinformed people I've ever spoken to.  The governor of California, who writes the gun, he wrote the gun law, right?  Believe me, we got Cuomo here.  He's just as bad.  This jerk was asked on TV that which, where do you put the rounds in the magazine that you put in a revolver?  Yeah, there you go.  This guy, this guy actually thought that a revolver had to have a magazine. 
[02:18:00]  Had a magazine.  Uh, he's the guy writing the rules.  They don't understand.  There was another woman, there was another woman politician, she was talking about gun control  and saying that if people use up all the magazines, there won't be any more magazines to use.  That's right.  She had no clue that you could reload the magazine.  But wait a minute, you have a problem with gun control?  Yeah.  Why?  It's not saying get rid of guns, it's saying gun control.  It is, by the way. 
[02:18:30]  When they say we're not taking your guns away, they're slowly taking your guns away.  Wait a minute, and I'm neutral.  Trying to buy an AR-15 here in New York, what happened?  We didn't take your guns away.  Yes, you did.  You took away my ability.  The latest now thing in California is you're going to have to register your guns.  Yeah.  Each gun.  Now, I have over 100 guns.  It's going to, of course, cost you $60 a year per gun to register your gun.  To register, wow.  Oh, they want money.  Now, so your gun collection, I've got black powder rifles. 
[02:19:00]  Of course, yeah, yeah.  I don't have an assault weapon at all.  I've got old lever actions, old guns with wood, you know?  Right.  And I'm going to have to pay $60 for each of my guns just in order to own them.  Could you imagine if you wanted to?  You better hope your show gets a second season.  I can't afford it.  Could you imagine if you had to pay in order to speak your mind to somebody because that's  your First Amendment right?  It's your Second Amendment right. 
[02:19:30]  The way they are infringing on that right is unbelievable.  It's against the Constitution.  No, I think guns kill, and you guys know that.  Both sides are extreme on this.  If you take away guns, and guns don't kill, I'll tell you.  People kill.  So you take away the guns, and you take away the knives.  Now, every murder that we have is going to have his brains bashed in by some kind of a  big rock.  Now, how does that sound?  You're not going to get a maul load of people being hit by that same rock. 
[02:20:00]  And also, too, if you're 20 feet away, that rock is not going to hit you.  I'm for guns only because you know what kind of neighborhood I live in.  If I was in that mall, and I had my concealed carry, there wouldn't be 20 people killed.  Well, I will guarantee you there wouldn't be 21.  There have been situations where legal, law-abiding gun owners have thwarted a lot of bad, potentially 
[02:20:30]  bad situations.  Every day.  Every day.  It's never reported as much as and sensationalized as much as a gun rush.  Oh, I wanted to bring something up, too.  Yes, sir.  I have a new show coming, huh?  Yes, of course you do.  It's called Saving Private K-9.  Yes.  And it's going to be undeniled at 8.30.  That's right.  And I just thought I'd put that out there.  On the Sportsman Channel, and you made a good point today about the Jews and what they've  done wrong.  Thank you very much.  I don't think anybody said that. 
[02:21:00]  I have no idea, sir.  I apologize for any misstatements made by this crew in here.  Terrible.  All right.  Let's get Arlie out of here.  Arlie, thank you so much.  Tonight's Sportsman Channel, 8.30.  Always a pleasure.  Got to be heading out.  Guys, it is a pleasure.  It always is a pleasure.  I'm glad you were obviously watching Fox and Friends this morning and spotted me.  There it is right there.  We saw you.  I said, get him up here.  Knew I was in town.  You know what happens, don't you?  What? 
[02:21:30]  When I open a new show like this, or anybody does, the people who are in charge of  getting publicity out there makes phone calls.  They call everybody.  Of course, your producer grabs it or somebody out in the front office, and all they can say  is, nah, looking at the list here, they're all booked up this Thursday.  And so you guys never even know I'm in town.  Probably happens like that, sure.  Until you happen to see me on TV. 
[02:22:00]  We know you'll cross the street.  Get him over here.  And we're never booked up.  But thank God you didn't see me on TV, and God bless.  All right.  God bless you, sir.  Until next time.  Until next time.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  The European Anthony Show is back on Sirius XM.  Here we go.  Oh. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  Pack him in.  Get off.  You're on the air.  He's in force.  There's no instinct.  Man.  There's no instinct.  No instinct.  He's putting our headphones on.  He just blathers on.  I'm sorry.  I'm looking at Anthony, who doesn't have his headphones, and he's...  I was chatting with the rich.  All right.  Arlie Emery, Ermie was great.  We've always had fun when that guy comes on.  I forgot how much fun he is and how entertaining he is.  There were so many people.  What was fun was the fucking shit these guys were saying.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[02:23:00]  I think I was accused of sucking a cock 11 times, and that was only by my own subconscious.  Accused is when you don't think you've done it.  I know, Rich.  That's why I said my subconscious.  Oh, boy.  That's why the word subconscious is used there.  Anthony got a souvenir, and he was so excited.  What'd you get?  No, Arlie came on his foot.  One of Arlie's challenge coins that he gave me.  He gave us those last time.  I don't have one.  Who wants mine?  It's his own. 
[02:23:30]  See, but this one, it's his own.  This one is mine, and it says Arlie Ermey on the front.  It's got a little image of him.  And then on the back, I guess he got together with Glock.  Really?  And he's got a couple of Glock things.  All right, we've got a big star on the line here.  I was an all-boy.  Big star.  I was calling in during the Arlie Ermey interview.  Colin?  Who was it?  Dane Cook?  Kevin Hart.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Kevin.  We've got Keith Robinson in studio, Rich Voss, and, of course, me, Anthony, and Jim Norton. 
[02:24:00]  How are you, boss?  We've got to do this quick before his calling card goes out.  The old product of y'all promoting.  With Keith Robinson and Rich Voss, that stinks.  Look, we've got Monique's hood ornament on the line.  Holy shit.  Wow.  What the hell?  Look and Rich.  Voss is still doing one-liners.  They need a drum behind them.  Okay.  And Keith is here to play that drum. 
[02:24:30]  With his hands.  He is so racist.  You're vicious.  Voss is completely racist.  That's coming from me.  Is it harder when you talk to the less successful guys like Voss?  It's so much harder because I have to dull it down.  It's like I'm doing nothing.  I got off a train.  Voss is about to sell his DVD for the seventh straight year.  No, it's not a DVD. 
[02:25:00]  It's a movie.  We made a movie, and we're signing the deal today.  We're signing the deal today.  Anybody else would try to tease you right now.  I'm going to take the opposite road, Voss.  I'm happy for you.  Thank you.  I'm proud of you, Voss.  That's awesome.  That's amazing, man.  Thank you.  That was a pat on the head from a guy making millions.  I don't care if this fucker's making millions.  I got him into Caroline's, and I threw phone books at him.  That's right.  He didn't go fuck himself.  And then he bought it and had you kicked out.  Keith, have you been talking about your special, Keith? 
[02:25:30]  Get down to business.  Have you been letting people know what you're about to do, how big this is for you?  Are you sitting there talking to Voss and Jim as if everything is fine and you got nothing  to talk about?  Whoa.  Who the hell are you talking to?  I'll tell you who he's talking to. 
[02:26:00]  He's talking to you, stupid.  Now answer him.  He's talking to the guy he's financing.  Well, Mr. Hart, here's how things are going.  That's right.  Chase Manhattan asked you a question.  And you get my dry cleaning.  Oh, do you know how much I love this?  Y'all leave my old fella alone.  Right now, I'm excited to Keith.  This is huge.  Keith is doing the special, and I'm making sure that it's done the right way.  I don't know if you guys have seen my specials, but they've been quite amazing. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I watch him to keep from coming.  Yeah.  The question is, why are you jerking off with them on to begin with?  Because he's adorable.  He's adorable.  Yeah.  As much as I really can't stomach Keith, I am happy that this, I think this is going  to be great, man.  Fans should get tickets.  You can go to, I guess, what are they, Ticketmaster for the Gramercy? 
[02:27:00]  Ticketmaster.  May 30th.  Two weeks from Friday.  Two weeks from Friday.  Here in New York.  Very easy to get to.  Keith is a, and I tweeted this, is a great comic and a horrible person.  I think that's the best description.  I fell on stage, man.  Oh, that fall is great.  Did you see that video I tweeted of Keith falling on stage?  First of all, Jay sent it to me immediately after it happened.  The funny thing is how he pops up as if nothing happens.  Fucking old voice. 
[02:27:30]  Jumped up, crazy shit going on.  Jimmy couldn't show it to enough people.  It was like the Zapruder film.  I showed it to everyone frame by frame analysis.  That bitch Amy Schumer, you could see her in the background from the reflection filming  it.  She sent it to me.  Nothing would make me laugh harder than at this special if it's all lights, camera action,  and Keith K minus L.  That just would be sad.  That just means I'm just old. 
[02:28:00]  I'd find out it's a problem.  Some kind of muscular dystrophy.  Don't worry, the numbers will fall.  But imagine, Ross, what do you have to get mean?  I'm the fucking mean.  Two guys are the meanest fucking humans.  We're trying to pick our friend up.  We're thinking about him falling.  Push this for him.  Pick him up.  Pick him up.  Jesus Christ.  Our backhoe couldn't pick him up.  What would be great is if Keith fell and one of his teeth came out, and that's unfixable 
[02:28:30]  in the moment.  Holy shit.  You had to cancel the whole thing.  I'm just saying.  Wow, Jesus Christ.  I mean, this is not what this is supposed to be about, man.  No, Jim.  What?  That was going to be bad.  It was taking too long.  Yeah, it was.  I was trying to paint a picture.  He's doing fucking spoken word.  Yes, that's what comedy is, you dope.  You should try that in white, Rich.  Oh, shit. 
[02:29:00]  It's just an angry room.  It's brutal.  But I'm never more comfortable with this than just fucking guys being mean to each other.  It brings me a feeling of joy.  It feels great.  It's absolute love.  It really does feel real good.  It's like home life.  Jim and Rich, here's my question to y'all.  What is the over and under on Keith wearing the suit?  What is Keith wearing for the best?  Going to do it?  I'm wearing a suit.  I'm not going to wear a cut-off shirt.  He's going to look like a background singer for the spinners. 
[02:29:30]  Nobody knows the spinners.  I'll take your references.  Exactly.  That's a new band to Rich.  Yes.  It's not a band.  It's a singing group, you fucking white racers.  It's still a band.  Shut up.  Leave alone.  Keith doesn't have to call himself Cedric, the non-entertainer.  I'm wearing a rust-colored suit.  Come out as no talent. 
[02:30:00]  Look at one out of three.  Wrap it up, Vaughn.  Yes.  You're getting the light, and I wish it was the white one.  No, because that would mean you're dead all day.  The one on the guard tower.  Or a train.  Give us the two lights coming at him quickly. 
[02:30:30]  This is beautiful ignorance.  This is beautiful ignorance, first thing in the morning.  We had Seth Rogen in.  He said you guys are doing the first cop buddy movie, which sounded very funny.  Yeah, we're doing the first ever black and white tandem.  It's not the first.  The first ever black and white partnership.  No, the first coupling of a black and a white cop.  Yeah, it's a historical piece.  Taking place in the 40s, I believe.  Oh, this is a real true story. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, it's real.  Me and Seth, yes, Keith, it's real.  What do you mean, a true story?  Is it a true story?  Yes.  I didn't know.  We were doing a movie together.  It's true that they're doing a movie together.  Aren't you doing a movie called Check Cashing?  No, Voss.  That's something you would do.  Okay, I'm just asking.  That's why Check Bouncing is really awesome.  No, no, no movie called Check Cashing.  And you know what, guys?  I don't want to turn this in to a Kevin Hart conversation, because we'll be talking about 
[02:31:30]  me all day.  Oh, sweet, guys.  Bring up on him.  Hang the damn photo.  We're all going to talk about Keith.  We're all going to talk about Keith.  My friend, Keith Robinson, and him taping a special.  That's what this is about, Keith.  This is about you, baby.  I'm here for you, man.  That's true.  Kevin's being very generous, saying, look, let's not talk about me, because it will just  overshadow my poor older gentleman friend.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Wow, Keith.  I mean, he's right, but Jesus Christ.  What, are you really going to wear a suit?  Yes, I'm wearing a damn suit. 
[02:32:00]  Yes, what do you mean?  A nice...  Steve Harvey wears a suit.  Oh, wow.  We've already been through that with Cedric.  Stop trying to be serious, man.  I'm helping you.  He's so racist.  That's not racist.  You are racist.  Yeah, I'm far from racist.  I grew up in an all-negro neighborhood.  I don't see color in my neighborhood.  I don't.  People are people.  I don't see color in my neighborhood.  I'm not a big fan of Aaron's.  I would tell Voss to stop, because he's going to affect his fan base.  But Voss doesn't have one. 
[02:32:30]  Hold on.  Are you implying that in all these years, Rich is pretty much a pile of nothing?  Pretty much.  Rich, listen.  Rich, here's the only thing that upsets me about Rich.  He's still trying to make it.  Oh, hell yeah.  Shut up and let us laugh, Rich.  That pisses me off about Rich.  He's still working out.  He's still using different type of face cream. 
[02:33:00]  Someone call it cum.  Oh, shit.  It just goes on and on and on and on.  I've never been a cum joke.  I didn't like it.  Or taste.  Holy fuck.  I miss you guys.  I'm going to say it.  I get emotional, man.  I miss my friends, guys.  I miss you guys.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:30]  I really do.  I miss the table, man.  Do you know how...  You know what?  Kev is really infuriated.  Oh, I know.  He's totally emotional.  I can't wait until his belly gets big.  And they boot him out of Hollywood with his little ball.  He's done with the ball.  Yeah, a little bald spot.  He's like fucking Frankie Lyman in the 70s.  Yeah, you guys are going to be pissed off when you see you on the cover of Men's Fitness with abs.  Oh, shit.  Are you on the cover of Men's Fitness?  I'm about to be.  Oh, I hate that magazine.  It was depressing, guys. 
[02:34:00]  I want to say it was two billboards in a row for different films.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  It was on 10th Avenue.  It was for, I think, About Last Night and the movie.  And Ride Along.  Yeah, and...  One of them had to be Ride Along.  There was something for fucking the Stallone movie, too.  It was Grudge Match.  Jesus.  About Last Night, Ride Along.  Wow.  How much did Ride Along make?  That made over $130 million, right?  $130 million.  Ride Along is at...  No, actually, we're at like $152 million worldwide right now.  That's a bomb for a comedy.  Motherfucking Q. 
[02:34:30]  Money, $152 million.  Wow.  And, you know, June 20th, we got things like a man, too, coming out.  But I don't want to play.  Well, well, well.  How about May 30th?  What's coming out?  Keith Robinson, Back of the Bus Funny.  That's what it's called.  Back of the Bus Funny.  7 p.m.  Huh?  10 p.m.  What'd you say?  Keith Robinson, Gramercy Theater, New York, May 30th.  K-2 shows, 7 p.m.  10 p.m.  And, Keith, not only am I coming, but I'm coming to watch.  I'm a fan. 
[02:35:00]  This is going to be huge.  By far, the reason for me being successful is Keith Robinson.  Wow.  There we go.  God damn.  After you said that, the sound that you should have heard was a gunshot.  Keith?  Keith?  I'm going on record.  Keith Robinson is responsible for my success, people.  Why?  Because he gave you a ride up here from Philly?  Hey, man.  Keith did a lot more than that, boss.  I'm going to tell you what he did.  What?  Me and Keith, our first time coming to New York, we saw you perform, and he said, don't do that. 
[02:35:30]  Have you seen boss on stage slobbering?  Where the black women at?  I said, oh, man, boss, I thought you were great.  I said, that guy's killing.  He's funny.  Keith said, no, no.  Dude's the complete opposite.  Did you know what it was, or did you think it was a Mr. Ed traveling show?  Sorry, boss, I didn't mean to make fun of you.  Really?  For what, the last 10 years? 
[02:36:00]  Keith is going to be huge, man.  Yeah.  It's good talking to you, too, Jim.  I didn't trash you enough.  I didn't trash you at all on this trip.  Jim is in shape right now, man.  Yeah, it's in the trash.  Jim's looking good.  I told Kevin, one of the reasons I started getting in shape was when he walked in, I didn't  see him in a while, and he just looked at me and went, your face is getting fat.  And I'm like, oh, could you?  I didn't even say hi.  No.  That is a hi.  But it was such a real response.  I'm like, ooh, I really am getting fucking fat.  I just attacked his weight.  I told you I did the same thing to Bobby.  I saw Bobby at the airport one time, and his stomach was just, his stomach was like, he looked 
[02:36:30]  like a beard bag.  Still the same.  Yeah, that didn't work for him.  Nothing for Bob.  No, he's on that diet.  He's doing all right.  What's that?  He's dropped seven pounds a day.  He's dropped maybe seven pounds in the last four months.  Listen, I didn't even say a word to Bobby.  Bobby said, hey, Kev.  I said, ugh.  Hey, did you and Mike Epps make up?  Why is he fucking with you on Twitter?  What happened there?  I don't know.  I did.  Mike, that's Mike.  Mike, one minute is happy, next minute is sad. 
[02:37:00]  Me and Mike talked.  We put it behind us, but I don't have time to deal with this.  I'm focused on being successful and accomplishing goals.  I don't get it.  How's that going for you?  Well, right now it works.  What are you fucking Tony Robbins?  He's fucking good.  He says he's Tony Robbins.  He didn't get the Tony Robbins response.  Jesus.  Yeah, he should.  He's got Tony Robbins money.  What are you doing?  You fucking selling Amway?  Let's go.  Jesus Christ.  Give us the inside scoop.  Yeah, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking positive Gandhi. 
[02:37:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Hey, walk around the room with a headset mic on.  You know what it's called, Voss?  It's called being politically correct in knowing how to stay a winner.  And, Voss, if you would listen to me, I want to talk to you because I think I figured out why you're not making it.  Are you going to, are you going to, like, implant the funny bone into him?  I think, I think when you got your teeth is when it went all bad.  When I got my new teeth? 
[02:38:00]  I said, you should have stuck with the original.  When you got your new teeth, your speech went sideways, and your jokes didn't hit the way they used to.  First of all, first of all, I'm at the, killing, killing.  Shut up, Daffy Duck.  You're fucking, Jesus Christ, you successful venereal award.  Voss was preparing for you, he said, I got to prepare, Kevin's going to come on.  I don't want him to get me. 
[02:38:30]  I didn't have enough, I didn't have enough time.  And the funny part, here's the greatest part of stand-up comedy.  The three biggest fucking failures in the business are yelling at the guy who does arenas,  fuck your positive attitude.  Like, we're doing fucking morning radio, and it's going on our resume.  Hey, fuck you.  Shut up.  This is the first thing on our resume.  They had to talk him into calling in. 
[02:39:00]  God, is that the truth?  Fucking horrible.  You don't want us to be your only point on your resume.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Thanks.  It should start with hurt on opiate athlete, and then not end with that.  I am singing about it.  We're flattered that we're mentioned, but it should be a whole list.  That's Jim's introduction.  It is.  You might know him from the meatpacking district. 
[02:39:30]  I haven't heard anything about this Keith Robinson special, though.  I've got to be honest with you.  Wow, man.  I wonder why Keith's going to start talking about it.  Funny you should mention it, man.  May 30th.  Back of the bus funny.  Keith Robinson.  That's what it is.  Where'd you get the name?  Back of the bus.  That's where all the things go on at.  Everything in the back of the bus.  That's where the cool shit happens.  The funny shit.  Yeah, the cool girls, the thugs.  Right in the back. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All the guys reading Wall Street Journal and Business Today up front.  Now, that move is in shakers now, but still.  We still have fun.  But you still have time.  They're the guys who gave you the special.  We use your theory in that fucking documentary, the back of the bus, and we show a bus.  Keith's theory is the best theory.  Did you give him credit for that?  Yeah, we say Keith Robinson's theory, the back of the bus.  Yeah, that's what it is.  I may sue y'all.  Guess what you signed, stupid.  Wait, but I signed something? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  What?  What am I, a 50s boxer?  I've heard how many times they heard that.  Guess what you signed, stupid.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  That is bad.  Rich.  Anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'm happy for you, man.  I really am.  For Keith.  I'm happy for Keith.  Yeah.  People, don't let this go by without you being a part of it.  Get your tickets now. 
[02:41:00]  Go to Ticketmaster, Gramercy Theater, May 30th.  Two shows, 7 p.m., 10 p.m.  Keith Robinson, Back of the Bus Special.  Being taped, being done right.  That's what I'm talking about.  Wow, man.  Come on, give young Don King a hand.  How about that?  That's right.  He really does know how to promote.  Yeah, he certainly does.  You've got to promote him.  That was concise right there.  Yeah.  I'm just, and that thing about us doing a movie together, I mean, I'm in for it.  Oh.  That's the positive thinking. 
[02:41:30]  It feels good.  Yeah.  It's called Tranny Hunter.  Exactly.  Yes.  A man lost his, what would I have lost?  The puns I was going to be and used his mouth, but I ran out of fucking set up.  Humor.  Hey, Kev, if you're in town next Tuesday, we're doing our live podcast at the Village Underground.  My Wife Hates Me with Jim Norton as our marriage counselor next Tuesday if you're in town. 
[02:42:00]  You know what?  Honestly, I'm not, but I'm going to be in there in a week, like in like two weeks.  I'll come by.  I'll come by if it's something you guys are doing.  Someday, I know you're too big.  All you have to do for me in life to repay me for getting you into Caroline's is when our movie comes out,  just tweet it one time and then we're cool.  That's it.  You know what, Voss, for you, that is done.  And I'll do it more than one time, Voss.  I'll make sure the people are aware of it.  Oh, you are a team player.  That's for you, Voss.  Because you don't even have to worry about it.  That's fucking, why would you ask him to do that?  Because he, I was going to ask him to do something. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, but you can't, you can't touch his cock over the phone.  Rich, why?  That doesn't have to be a gay joke.  Listen, I, listen, I'm a gay joke, Rich, all I know is, all I know is, my pal, Kevin Hart,  said he would tweet, and that's all I need in life.  Thank you.  That's right.  I got you, man.  He likes you, because you're the only comic he's taller than.  That's right, shrimp, you heard me.  We're going to tweet it, too, Rich.  Huh? 
[02:43:00]  We're going to tweet it.  And I'm happy about that.  I'm happy you're involved.  I'm happy everybody's involved.  I'm going to tweet it, too.  Yeah, good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good news.  With Voss's and Keith's and Norton's tweets, that's about, that totals up to my comments.  Oh, come on, man.  That's just too much.  Now you're doing, you're bullying now.  Yeah.  Come on, they're down.  Come on, Kevin.  Jesus. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, wow.  That was just hurtful in the end.  Yeah, it was very mean.  Fairly accurate.  Sucks when it's accurate, fuck.  I fucking love it.  You tweeted about, too, you tweeted about fucking, about Sterling and how annoying.  You won't go back to a Clippers game.  You know a lot of those guys, right?  No, I'm not going back.  I know all of them.  I know every single one of them.  Until he's out, I'm definitely not going back.  Wow.  What is, like, because you know the players.  I don't know these guys.  What is their thing on it?  Like, they just disgusted with this guy and they want him gone.  I mean, of course.  You know, it's a tough situation for them as well as the coach. 
[02:44:00]  But at the end of the day, you know, you don't work hard to get to a place in life, you know,  over something that you have no control of at that point.  Like, if they weren't this deep in the season, it would be completely different.  But they put themselves in position to win a championship.  And now, you know, that dream becomes a reality.  So they're going to execute their goals.  And if they don't, you know, next season is when they deal with him and his problem.  But I definitely don't see a lot of players coming back if Donald Sterling is still in that position. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  They're talking about, like, not showing up for next season.  I think LeBron James had mentioned something.  Yeah.  A lot of players, it's going to be a tough stand.  The NBA will not be able to function if Donald Sterling is still in office.  I can guarantee that.  So, Kevin, so if it was earlier in the season, you think these guys would have stopped playing for him?  Yeah.  Wow.  For sure.  And also, it was also a thing where when they had the meeting and Adam Silver was supposed to make the announcement, 
[02:45:00]  if something harsh wasn't happening to Donald Sterling, the players are going to boycott that game.  Yeah, I heard that, too.  They had been talking about that.  And the NBA was in a really, especially when Obama mentioned Adam Silver.  And he didn't say, get rid of this guy, but you knew what he was saying.  That's a really tough position for the fucking commissioner to be putting in.  Well, it's more than tough, but I think for Adam Silver, it's coming in with the bang for him  because he handled the situation correctly.  And now players have a different level of respect for him, especially players of color, any minority, 
[02:45:30]  because he stood up and did what was right.  And right now, I think all the other owners are in a position where they have to do the same thing  because there is no business in the NBA with a man like that in the office.  With the NBA, when you say players of color, you could just say players.  Yeah.  Hey, do you play, like, we used to play ball at the end of the night,  and Kevin is, he is fucking really good in basketball.  He said he was tweet.  He said he was.  I know, I want to ask him to be so serious. 
[02:46:00]  Calm down.  Do you play with these guys?  I know you hang out with them.  Do you play ball with them?  No.  For what?  For me to mess up their game?  No.  He's fucking.  I literally, I play a little bit with my kids and stuff.  I don't play as much as I used to anymore.  I'm getting old, fellas.  Not your kind of old.  I'm getting cool people old.  You know, just old enough where it's all right for me to say I don't want to do that.  I'm not like, my back doesn't hurt like you guys. 
[02:46:30]  I'm fine.  Do you know Obama?  Have you met Obama?  Mm-hmm.  That's my guy.  I call him, call him O-Beezy.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  You know what?  I've met Obama before you.  Maybe he had, but does he remember you?  No.  No.  No, neither is the crowd from last night.  No, I met him and Michelle several times.  You know, I was also a person who, you know, donated to his campaign and done several things.  You know, Keith, that's the thing with me. 
[02:47:00]  Voss met Nixon, so.  Golfed with him.  Play some golf.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's do this.  I'm finished with you.  I'm done with you.  Promote the Keith special is live taping May 30th here in the city.  Yes.  Go to Ticketmaster.  Two shows, people.  7 p.m.  10 p.m.  Go to Ticketmaster.  This will not just be a show. 
[02:47:30]  It will be an event.  This is Keith Robinson, people.  Now, yes, you may not know the name.  Let me tell you something, people.  You will, after he has done this taping, you will remember and you will laugh.  Keith Robinson, a.k.a.  The Reason Why I Am Where I Am Today.  The man knows comedy and he does it very well.  Two shows, Gramercy Theater.  7 p.m.  10 p.m.  Go check it out.  See you later, Kevin.  Thank you, Kevin.  Wow.  Kevin Hart, everyone.  Look at this.  All right.  Good to see you.  Got Kevin Hart promoting your show?  Yeah, he's producing it. 
[02:48:00]  I figured that out, Jim.  Thanks.  I don't know why I said that.  Because you're inside show business I am.  He's really good.  The only thing he got wrong, he said, you may not know Keith.  Oh.  Oh.  Say the rest of it, man.  Yeah, Rich.  So in the blank.  Why do you take just a mean stance?  You're just all the time, boss.  All the time.  Listen, why do you blow out Keith's candle so yours will shine brighter?  Let Keith's flickering candle shine.  It is flickering. 
[02:48:30]  It is flickering.  I think I put it out when I fell.  That candle's out.  Oh, my God.  How much fun did we used to have sitting outside Boston Comedy Club till four in the morning?  It was us three, Kev, Patrice.  And people would sit upstairs and yell out their window to shut up.  We would just sit out there all morning.  Why would they say shut up?  Do they understand what was going on below them? 
[02:49:00]  We had to work in the morning.  It was like three o'clock on a Tuesday.  We wouldn't start the trashing in the cellar and then walk a block and stop and trash each other.  Then we'd get another block.  And we couldn't get to our cars without hours of just fucking trashing each other.  It was...  You can't...  Billy Burr came...  I can just tell this story.  We've told it a million times.  Billy Burr came into the cellar one night and said, I'm going to the Yankee Met World Series game.  And we go, how'd you get ticket? 
[02:49:30]  World Series game.  We go, how'd you get tickets?  He said, these guys are doing a bus trip and I'm going to do a show on their bus for free.  We fucking smashed Billy.  I'm telling you, sweat was pouring out of his face.  Someone told me I'm the one who tattled on him.  I think Bill told me I'm the one who snitched on him.  I don't remember.  Because he offered me the gig and I couldn't do it.  It was so brutal.  It was like someone threw fucking blood into a shark tank. 
[02:50:00]  That's like, Patrice's eyes lit up.  Why would you say that?  Let me tell you something.  Kevin, as big...  I'd love to have heard that.  It's so funny with comics.  As big as you get, like as big...  Kevin, you can't get any bigger.  You'll never forget those nights that we fucking smash each other.  Stop hoping.  I don't know.  He's forgotten them.  Oh, it's over.  Yeah, a $150 million movie makes you forget those nights. 
[02:50:30]  You'll hold on to those nights and the guy's still doing it.  The movie billboards in a row are very distressing.  Very distressing.  You're waxing fantastic about the old things.  If you're still doing the Dougal Street Struck.  You know what makes you forget those nights?  Dinner with De Niro makes you forget those nights.  I guess shaking hands with the president.  Yeah, makes you forget when Voss called you on short stuff on fucking West 3rd at 2 in the morning. 
[02:51:00]  Pushes those memories right out.  Oh, it does.  We want to tell you a little story.  The memories of your witticisms were fucking forced out like a bad burrito.  I got great news.  We're going to follow up to Kevin Hart, believe it or not.  Really?  Just as good, yes.  It's got to be Colin.  Hi.  No, no.  Oh, Christ.  Say it's Diana.  Ha.  There you go. 
[02:51:30]  We should take a break, though.  Wait, can I do it?  Keith Robinson is here.  Rich?  Yes, Rich.  Next Tuesday at the Village Underground.  That'll sell out.  What are you worried about?  Live podcast.  It's going to sell out.  It'll be fine.  Well, this weekend we had to sell out at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse.  Me and Bonnie.  People don't have a chance to see Bonnie perform that much.  She doesn't go out.  She's great.  She killed.  She's great.  She killed on the Patrice benefit.  I'm telling you, it's a great show.  The Arlington Cinema Drafthouse.  All right.  And I have a plug, too.  The Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, Thursday the 24th. 
[02:52:00]  I'm doing the keynote speech at the Hyatt.  And then the 26th, I have a midnight show at the Gisu Theater.  HaHaHa.  HaHaHa.  And, of course, Keith, May 30th here in New York.

Well, she says that like she has an experience with you.  Right.  I have a question about the super show.  Yes, Sam.  Are you guys willing to pay any of the guests?  No.  What?  No.  What the fuck do you think we're paying?  Wait, there's one guest holding out for money? 
[02:55:30]  Let me guess.  Why do you look like you should be on that show True?  What?  What show is that True?  You guys don't get it.  That's a good reference.  I don't know what that is.  I've never heard of it.  Yeah.  Who wants to get paid?  Who do you think?  Maybe I said the name wrong.  You can't figure out when you're being talked to?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  They're asking to get paid to be on the show?  Somebody is.  Yes.  No.  I don't.  You don't know when someone is talking to you?  Oh, my God.  We're not talking to you. 
[02:56:00]  At this moment.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Have you ever been part of a group conversation ever in your life?  She is a group conversation.  Circle jerk.  I'm not talking to you.  She was pivoting.  Who wants to get paid, Sam Roberts?  Sandy.  Sandy Kane.  Why did you get paid?  I had her on the phone yesterday afternoon and she said, all right, I'll do it.  I need money, man.  I need money, man.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You know how much she wants?  She wants to get paid? 
[02:56:30]  She wants $1,000.  $1,000?  $1,000?  Wow.  That's what I make in Times Square, baby.  That's what I make.  That's a lot to ask for.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I was just telling everyone how sad our careers are.  We go from Kevin Hart back to reality with this fucking cow.  We should just hang up on it.  What are we doing with this fucking monster?  This is not an accident.  This is on purpose.  This isn't fate.  Shut up. 
[02:57:00]  What are we doing?  Well, we were promoting the super show, which is happening tomorrow.  Yeah, it'll be on tomorrow.  Tune in.  Goodbye, fatso.  There you go.  What the fuck are we doing?  Half the audience just turned their radio off when you said that.  It's their new goodbyes.  She's just going to contribute nothing.  Same babbles.  Yes.  No, we were going over the whole super show.  We were talking about how Santa Cain wants to get paid $1,000 tomorrow. 
[02:57:30]  Yes.  Are you willing to pay?  No, we covered that.  All right.  Show the camera she wants.  There's a fuck.  Colin will be here.  This fucking die will be here.  A few others will be here.  Red carpet.  Yeah, red carpet.  We will have a red carpet.  We'll cover it tomorrow morning.  Mike said he's going to be there?  Yeah, good.  You keep plugging away.  Fantastic.  Goodbye.  Thanks.  Done.  You don't need to do a promo show for the fucking super show.  It's tomorrow.  We got it.  What are we doing?  I love it.  It's like we can't help ourselves. 
[02:58:00]  That's what I said.  It's self-flatulation.  It's self-destructive.  It fucking is.  I said it.  What are we, afraid of having a good show?  We don't know what to do.  We had the biggest comedian in Hollywood right now call in.  Yes.  We're having a great show.  We're having a great time.  And then all of a sudden, you know what?  This is going too well.  Yes.  Let's just ruin the listening experience.  There's an iceberg.  Literally.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, hold on.  We got Bobo on the phone.  Oh, we do? 
[02:58:30]  Oh, I hope he would have taken that call.  No, I'm sick.  It's like we all have like little home bases we like to touch.  Right.  But talk about the apron strings.  We're strangling ourselves.  What the fuck are we doing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, Lady Di, we'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, be well.  Stay safe and stay alive until tomorrow.  Take care.  But did she get something to wear?  Did you get something?  No, no, I have.  Surprise us.  Surprise us.  Who's the fuck?  It's not entertaining for anybody.  What are you doing? 
[02:59:00]  Who cares?  Tonight, wear a radio in the bathtub.  Okay.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow in your gown.  Yeah, that's it.  All right?  Dress pants and a dress shirt.  Whatever you wear, who cares?  God bless you.  We're a clan hood.  I don't care what you wear.  Show up or don't, Piggy.  It's up to you.  I don't give a fuck.  My money doesn't go up or down if you're here.  See you tomorrow or I won't.  Surprise me.  I will show up.  I'm sure you will.  God bless.  All right, you too. 
[02:59:30]  Bye.  If the sidewalk is cracked in the morning, I'll know she showed up.  Look, there's the black distended liver passing around.  Sam?  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  All right.  It'll be a good show tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's not going to be today's show.  No, it won't.  Oh, no, it won't.  We're bigger than lady dye.  We're bigger than U.S. lawn.  Yeah, don't come to the farm. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, God, is that funny.  The sidewalk is cracked.  I love a good Hyman Roth improv.  Oh, sure.  Wow, look at that fucking memorial, man.  That place is amazing.  Yeah, we were talking about that this morning.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I guess Obama's speaking at the 9-11 Memorial Museum.  Oh, he's going on now.  The dedication.  That's it.  Oh, that's the wall.  Here's something Keese's not used to.  Who's Keese? 
[03:00:30]  Applaud.  Keese.  Applaud.  Keese.  Keese is not used to applaud.  Keese isn't used to applaud.  Honored guests.  It's like a child.  Families of the fallen.  In those awful moments,  after the South Tower was hit,  some of the injured huddled in the wreckage  of the 78th floor.  The fires were spreading. 
[03:01:00]  The air was filled with smoke.  It was dark.  And they could barely see.  It seemed as if there was no way out.  And then there came a voice.  Christy, Cuomo, Bloomberg.  Clear.  All the stars.  The stars are there.  Saying he had found the stairs.  A young man. 
[03:01:30]  In his 20s.  Strong.  That man was Mo Green.  Emerged from the smoke.  And over his nose and his mouth,  he wore a red handkerchief.  I didn't ask any questions.  I knew it was business.  He called for fire extinguishers  to fight back the flames.  He tended to the wounded.  He led those survivors  down the stairs to safety.  And carry a woman on his shoulders  down 17 flights. 
[03:02:00]  Then he went back.  Back up all those flights.  Then back down again.  Bringing more wounded to safety.  Bill Clinton, Hillary.  Until that moment  when the tower fell.  They didn't know his name.  They didn't know where he came from.  Sounds like rich.  But they knew  that Elias had been saved  by the man in the red bandana. 
[03:02:30]  Again, Mayor Bloomberg,  distinguished guests,  Mayor de Blasio,  Governors Christie,  and Cuomo,  and the families  and survivors of that day.  To all those who responded  with such courage,  on behalf of Michelle  and myself  and the American people,  it is honor  for us to join 
[03:03:00]  the snub.  Yeah, how about Giuliani?  Well, then he's  probably just mentioned  New York.  To recall  and to reflect.  But above all,  to reaffirm  the true spirit  why wouldn't Giuliani  be there?  Of 9-11.  He's there.  Maybe he is.  Well, then why wouldn't he sing?  Maybe just tell us that.  Compassion.  Sacrifice.  And to enshrine it  forever  in the heart  of our nation.  Michelle and I  just had the opportunity 
[03:03:30]  to join with  others  on  a visit  with some of the survivors  and families,  men and women  who inspire us all.  and we had a chance  to visit some  of the exhibits.  And I think all  who come here  will find  it to be a profound  and moving experience.  I want to express  our deep gratitude  to everybody  who was involved  in this great undertaking  for bringing us 
[03:04:00]  to this day.  For giving us  this sacred place  of healing.  You're going to go down  there when it opens, Jim?  Yeah, I think so, man.  I think so.  Here at this memorial  at this museum,  we come together.  We stand  in the footprints  of two mighty towers  graced  by the rush  of eternal waters.  We look 
[03:04:30]  into the faces  of nearly  3,000  innocent souls.  Men and women  and children  of every race,  every creed,  from every corner  of the world.  We can  touch their names.  That was the wall  that separated the water.  What do they call it?  A glimpse  the small items  that speak  to the beauty  of their lives.  Gigantic.  Yeah.  A wedding ring,  a dusty helmet, 
[03:05:00]  a shining badge.  Here,  we tell  their story  so that  generations yet unborn  will never  forget  of co-workers  who led  others to safety,  of passengers  who stormed  a cockpit,  our men and women  in uniform  who rushed  into an inferno, 
[03:05:30]  our first responders  who charged up  those stairs.  A generation  of service members,  our 9-11 generation,  who have served  with honor  in more than  a decade of war.  He always wondered  what like a decade  after it was going to be like.  A nation that stays tall  and united  and unaffected  because  no act of terror  can match the strength  or the character  or a company.  I actually thought  this would have been done  a lot sooner, 
[03:06:00]  you know?  It's just typical  fucking bureaucracy  and too many people  making decisions.  13 years later,  the museum goes up.  Nothing  can ever  break us.  The buildings  haven't finished.  Yeah.  Nothing  can change  who we are  as Americans.  It should have been done  in five years  of whole area.  Right.  Yeah.  On that September morning,  the houses were built  in,  yeah,  like five years  was it?  Not even?  Crowther.  Lost her son,  Wells. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah,  this is just  months later.  Wow, man.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Have you seen  that documentary  on the lady?  Hold on your hats, kid.  Right.  This is somehow  going to tie into nothing.  Have you seen  that documentary  on the lady  that said she was  there when it happened?  Oh, that fucking pig.  Oh, and she was.  Yeah.  Right.  She was a liar.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was a liar.  She lied.  She was like  with all the fucking  victims groups  and stuff.  Yes.  He was a head  of a victims group.  Yes.  What the fuck?  She said she was  supposed to marry  somebody that died 
[03:07:00]  in the tower.  Was the lady die?  Yeah.  Fat pig.  Wow, that's sad.  Oh, that's sad.  And you know,  it looks like Obama  was ready to freaking start.  Yeah, he's an emotional guy.  Crying there.  Well, I'm sure  he met a lot of people  before his speech.  Probably a lot of sadness  in that room.  They all get it  once in a while  something hits him.  That looks like  an amazing building  or a museum.  Yeah.  It looks very echoey  and how high  is the ceiling? 
[03:07:30]  I think it costs  $161 million to build.  I think I heard that.  Cathedral-like atmosphere.  It's going to be intense.  Yeah, it's like  kind of a cathedral-y  kind of atmosphere  you get in there  and you get a lot of echoing.  They just showed  the red bandana  that's going to be  on display too.  Oh, no.  The red bandana  was just disgusting.  Maybe you guys  will be able  to broadcast how to do that.  Good one, Rich.  Yeah, that's what  we should do.  Right, Rich?  You guys covered it.  You covered it great.  Shut up.  Stop trying to make  more forgiveness.  By the way, Travis,  did you get his trip 
[03:08:00]  before?  Which one?  Who is he?  No, but this  Keese and applaud.  Keese.  Keese.  I'm tired, man.  That's something  Keese never hears.  Applaud.  I've never been that tired  where I've made  that many errors in a row.  Wow, man.  Keese.  It's these little  individual things  that creeps out.  Someone has to know  who that is.  Who, that guy?  No, the bandana.  Someone must go,  oh, yeah, he went  to work wearing that  unless that was  just something  he put on at work.  Right.  What, uh,  you get that flub?  The dedication. 
[03:08:30]  That's it.  Oh, that's the wall.  Here's something  Keese not used to.  He's Keese.  Keese not used to applaud.  Keese not used to applaud.  Here's the thing.  Oh, no.  That might be your first  here's the thing, by the way.  Here's the thing.  You almost made a whole show  without it.  Yeah, I'm saying that.  Keese not used to applaud.  Keese applaud.  What happens when words  try to come out?  They really do.  It's like they're marching  Bobby with Bobby. 
[03:09:00]  That's discombobulated.  I've made errors similar.  Jesus.  Words go through  like a crazy straw  coming out of your mouth.  They do.  I forgot you're still here.  I didn't even realize.  It's like the words  are marching out  and they don't see  the big fucking hole  on the ground  and they just fall into it  and tumble out of your mouth.  Like instead of going  like back behind your throat  and coming up over the tongue  they fall through  your dumb sinus  and bounce off your teeth.  I'm rich. 
[03:09:30]  I love you, Rich.  Where is Giuliani?  I don't know.  I'm not his fucking  booking agent.  He's probably there.  He cares where he is.  I'm sure he's there.  You want to say something  controversial?  Maybe he's away.  Maybe he's in a fucking,  you know,  America's mayor.  You'd think he'd have  cleared his schedule  to show up for this.  He's a big guy,  you know,  in this whole thing.  He's not there.  I don't think he's there.  Maybe he's in,  who's that?  Hillary Stunt Double?  She looks like him.  Almost.  Can we understand  why you'd say that?  You have to explain  to fucking comedians  why you'd say  Hillary Stunt Double.  Obama's done already. 
[03:10:00]  I wanted to do so.  A little cocky  this morning.  Thank you to his parents  and my new friend  Jeff and Allison.  Oh, man.  This is brutal.  That's too depressing.  Yeah,  this is just going to be  really depressing stuff.  Right.  And I don't like  the sadness  without anybody  remembering the anger.  Just be mad.  Yeah,  none of it's going  to be brought up.  Again,  if you're not  talking about,  you know.  Oh,  they're not talking  about what caused it.  Terrorism and extremism  and fucking blah, blah, blah. 
[03:10:30]  The hatred towards.  All that shit.  Right, right.  We got a strange  one on the line here.  Let's try it.  Jeff in Tennessee,  what's up?  Yeah,  I need some advice.  Last night,  I came home from work  and I found my blow-up doll  hiding from me  in the closet.  Your blow-up doll  was hiding from you  in the closet.  Yeah,  I mean,  what do I do?  I mean, 
[03:11:00]  she's the only person  I'm fucking in.  I mean,  if she doesn't want  to fuck me,  I mean,  what do I do  to coast her out?  You know what's said  that you planned this call?  Yeah.  Mike,  what's going to be good?  Yeah,  what can I say?  What can I say?  Well,  he got on  and he did get a chuckle.  No,  he didn't.  I don't know.  The way he said it.  Exactly.  I don't know what they do.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Jeff,  you're doing a bit.  Hey,  I want to tell you, 
[03:11:30]  don't believe anything  that blabbing idiot said.  She doesn't know  what it is.  There's five of them  in the room.  What are you talking about?  Which one?  Are you deaf?  Are you deaf?  No,  I can hear you.  Unfortunately,  I wish I was.  Jim's on now.  There's a guy on TV  that apparently  looks like an older man.  We know.  We know.  Well,  the audience can't see it.  Is that the fireman  who was standing next to Bush?  I don't know.  Oh,  it might be. 
[03:12:00]  It doesn't tell  what time it is anymore.  Thank you,  Jeff,  in Tennessee.  Good luck with the blow up,  Dom.  Well,  what it does tell.  I don't think it is  the fireman.  Is what time it was.  Oh,  why?  It says it's  the 11th.  Jesus.  And so this,  this marks the time.  Oh,  it's a mangled watch.  The successful counterattack  on Flight 93  ended.  Rolex. 
[03:12:30]  Oh,  that came from  Flight 93.  Damn.  It stopped at 9-11.  Oh,  it's out when it's shot.  No,  the 11th was the day.  Whatever time it stopped.  It looked like it said 9-11.  We are all grateful  today  to the Memorial Board,  the staff,  and the families  for creating  this really  magnificent memorial.  Shut up and give me back  my assault rifles.  Probably the wrong time.  Is it?  All right.  I'll step back for a minute. 
[03:13:00]  I think that's the fireman.  I think so.  Todd Beamer's watch  was recovered  at the site of the crash  of Flight 93.  I wanted to be a fireman.  I wanted to be a fireman.  It was given to this museum  by his living family.  We are honored  to have his father,  David.  Yeah,  it's his father.  Oh,  it's the guy's father.  It's his father.  Oh.  Todd was one of 40 men  and women  aboard that plane.  It's his son's watch.  Oh. 
[03:13:30]  It's brutal.  All bound for San Francisco.  Damn it.  It's the let's roll guy,  right?  Is that him?  I don't know.  I think that guy's name  was Jeff,  yeah.  Was it?  Yeah,  bastards.  What are you going to do now?  Everybody forgot.  Let's start wrapping up.  Everyone forgot the anger.  No one's mad anymore  at the Muslims.  I know they were  going to let them  build a fucking mosque  down there.  What the fuck?  This fucking country is this?  A week after 9-11,  if a Muslim said  they were going to  build a mosque 
[03:14:00]  by the side,  you'd get fucking like,  literally people would have  started shooting Muslims  in the street.  I know.  And now it's like,  well,  we need to have  an open discussion  about this.  It's not all.  And as I will  always quote Colin,  a few million bad apples  boil the whole thing.  You will.  All right,  it's Keith Robinson's day.  Ah, yeah.  Got the big taping  two weeks from tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  At the Gramercy Theater. 
[03:14:30]  Two shows.  So go see Keith  as he tapes his special.  It's going to be great.  Yeah, of course.  We all know that.  The people need to know that.  Thank you, Voss.  Kills.  He's old school, man.  All right.  So that's going down.  That was a really  heartfelt plug.  Yeah.  Comedian Keith Robinson.com  for more info on that.  Or just get your tickets  through Ticketmaster  for the Gramercy.  Massa.  And next Tuesday.  That's shit.  Next Tuesday.  I will be with Rich  and Bonnie  at My Wife Hates Me 
[03:15:00]  live podcast  that apparently  fucking Merv Griffin Kelly  is producing.  Yeah.  You fucking guys  trying to be a fucking  he wants to be a big shot  so bad.  He does.  Well, he's got the big part.  And he should be shot.  You can get tickets  at the Comedy Cellar website  for Tuesday night  and also this weekend  at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse  right outside fucking D.C.  Great club.  Great fucking club  if you're in that area. 
[03:15:30]  Wait, would you get a pay  to go to the museum?  People are saying?  Yeah.  24 bucks to get in.  But they  did that to offset the costs?  They said it cost  $60 million a year.  But couldn't the government  just...  Yeah, how about we just  don't give money to Egypt  or any other country?  There you go.  Why didn't the government  take that?  Take that hit?  We shouldn't be...  Ah, whatever.  That's ridiculous.  Or is that a suggested donation?  Nope.  $24 a ticket for it.  No.  Those kids are...  That's great.  So what about a guy  who's a fucking homeless  or whatever?  It sounds stupid.  Do people who have no money  can't go? 
[03:16:00]  I think on Tuesdays  for three hours  you can get in for free.  Okay.  I like the fact that  poor people should be  left out of this whole thing.  Well, you're not wrong.  Frankly, I'm mucking  the whole thing up.  Yeah, with all their poor shit.  Yes.  They're the reason  bad things happen.  You want it to look like  the fucking subways?  He's losing fucking weight.  Look at him.  Chris, he wants to run  for the president.  He's going to win.  Oh, yeah.  He's not going to win.  Do you think Hillary's  going to beat him?  He alienated his core. 
[03:16:30]  He's too old.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, it'll vote for any of them.  I don't even know  if he'll make the...  I'm sorry.  The next white male president  will be 2064.  What?  You got to root  in front of the white male president?  Jesus Christ.  Next straight.  Gotta help me out here.  Say goodbye.  Jesus Christ.  I know how the fucking  Red Sox fans felt  for all those years.  Yeah, we are finished.  It's a wrap. 
[03:17:00]  Done.  It's a wrap.  That's it.  It's over.  You guys got to get a letter  and you'll come up.  Is that it?  Yeah, we got the N-word.  I know.  You know, you need a letter.  How long until...  White guys need a nice letter.  How long until a Jew  becomes president?  Who?  A Jew.  How long do you think?  God.  No one cares.  That's it.  No.  Here's what's going to happen.  We're going to elect  a president  and he's going to come out  and go,  oh, by the way,  at the inauguration,  I'm a Jew.  He's going to sneak his way  and keep it the way  it's been,  them running things  behind the scenes. 
[03:17:30]  That's right.  Like the banks  and the weather.  Yes, I bet.  And the weather.  They are brilliant.  All right.  Well, tomorrow,  we had a great show today  with Keith,  who's hilarious,  and I love boss.  And, of course, Kevin.  And tomorrow  just will be  a monumental disappointment.  Just utter nonsense tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Stay tuned.  Yeah, you do that.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[03:18:00]  The Opie and Anthony show  has gone to a close.  Stay tuned  to reflect,  relive,  and get the story  behind the story  of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts,  Opie and Anthony post show  begins in moments. </pre>
