<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the Detroit Tigers' no-hitter, veering into a humorous tangent about premature team celebrations.  This transitioned into a conversation about the low ratings of the NBA Finals and LeBron James' missed shot.  The hosts then recounted a recent meeting with their agent, Bob, and a chance encounter with Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick at a restaurant, detailing their humorous, possibly stalker-like, pursuit of the actors and speculating on their ages.  Bob's report of a massive cicada infestation in Chicago followed, corroborated by numerous listener calls from Chicago detailing the sheer volume and disruptive nature of the insects. The hosts then announced a giveaway of 100 tickets to their comedy tour and introduced the day's guests: Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, and others.  A segment on “the worst death ever” followed, with callers submitting various gruesome scenarios.  The hosts then reported on a supposed death of Vince McMahon, incorporating details from a WWE correspondent and their own humorous “investigation.” The show continued with a discussion of a “free hugs” video from Second Life featuring an aggressively sexual naked avatar, concluding with further off-topic anecdotes and discussion of the hosts' diets.  Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio.

The next segment heavily featured comedian Bob Kelly, focusing on his numerous knee surgeries and experiences with incompetent doctors.  Kelly graphically detailed his surgeries, the pain, and receiving a cadaver's ACL, with humorous reactions and sarcastic commentary from the hosts and guest Jimmy Norton. The discussion included anecdotes about his recovery and internet searches for doctors.  The conversation shifted to the upcoming Opie and Anthony comedy show at Jones Beach, discussing promotional activities like "Whip Em Out Wednesday."  Further discussion of Kelly's knee and humorous stories about massage therapists followed, including a digression about a "mature" masseuse and her unconventional methods. Finally, they mentioned an upcoming segment featuring an intercepted phone call from Paris Hilton.  Bob Kelly and Jimmy Norton were in studio.

The final segment opened with an intercepted phone call allegedly involving Paris Hilton, with poor audio quality suggesting conversations about Jessica Simpson's drug use. The conversation then veered into a humorous anecdote about Mark McGrath's nudity in a hot tub, one host declaring a love for gay porn, and the discussion of malicious computer pranks involving hidden pornography and obscenity-laced audio files disguised as harmless content. The hosts discussed the pranks' effectiveness in an office setting, then transitioned to live interaction with viewers on Paltalk, featuring topless and nude women. Jimmy exposed himself on camera.  A lengthy discussion about Steve, a staff member who had shaved his eyebrows, ensued, followed by a graphic conversation about anal itching, Preparation H, and personal hygiene practices, including licking ears and armpits and controversial opinions on bathroom etiquette.  The segment concluded with more Paltalk interaction featuring nude women, promotion of a Father's Day Bunny Ranch giveaway, the Jones Beach event, and "Whip'em Out Wednesday."

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And with that.  And with that, we say good morning to Detroit.  Detroit.  Detroit.  Detroit.  Detroit.  What's up, Detroit? 
[00:05:00]  Detroit.  Detroit.  Detroit.  How about that?  No hitter.  You were watching, what, the end of the game in your hotel room last night?  I was watching the end of the game, but I had the volume down because I was on the phone.  So I'm watching, and I see the whole Detroit team, like, jumping around in the middle of the field, grabbing each other and doing the big huddle jump thing.  And I'm looking going, what month is this?  What the hell are they? 
[00:05:30]  Either that or they've had a horrid season, and they finally won a game.  I couldn't figure out why they were doing the big we clinched the pennant celebration in June.  Our lives are so effed up, you know.  I had no clue how much it was.  So I'm looking, and then I'm looking.  It's very possible that it could have been the clinching of the pennant.  I'm like, am I on classic ESPN?  Like, everything was running through my head.  I couldn't figure it out.  But apparently, yes, a no-hitter pitch. 
[00:06:00]  No-hitters are very exciting.  Yeah.  No matter who pitches it.  That last out, you know, that pop fly.  You're just waiting for the outfield at a month to catch.  Yeah.  But, no.  There you go.  It wasn't.  And there you go.  A no-hitter.  So we say good morning to Detroit.  Detroit.  And hello, Cleveland.  How are you?  Hi.  How great would it be if a team just decided to celebrate a pennant win, like, now?  Like, if they had just celebrated and they had their, like, American League champs? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God.  See, that's funny.  They should do that.  Just asses.  Just asses.  A team.  And one that's, like, in last place.  Yeah.  You just, you win a game and the entire team runs out of the dugout celebrating on the field.  You win a weekend series with the Milwaukee Brewers.  And you decide, you decide to have an all-out celebration.  You have the hats made up so they're all wearing the championship hats.  Champagne.  We beat the Milwaukee Brewers.  And just a puzzled crowd standing around and a puzzled press going, what is going on? 
[00:07:00]  Just come running out of the dugout with champagne and you're spraying it over each other.  You jump on a police horse backwards.  While holding your finger up.  Number one.  Up on the dugout.  Guys, it's June 8th.  We knew we could do it.  We believed ourselves.  The freaking spectators would just be walking out in confusion, looking over their shoulder like, what the? 
[00:07:30]  What did they win?  Who the?  Was this a special game?  And then the Jumbotron just has a huge graphic.  World champions of the Milwaukee Brewers.  Brewers.  And then the whole locker room's in plastic.  All the local sports writers are in there like, what?  Getting doused with champagne.  What is this?  Well, no, they don't do poor champagne.  The reporters walk in.  They're all shirtless and kissing and talking to each other. 
[00:08:00]  They're like homorotically.  They really want to take it over the top.  That's a problem with professional sports.  They don't bring humor or comedy into it ever.  Why not?  No fun.  I mean, they play like 300 games a year now.  So why not in the middle of it just to mess it up a little bit?  Yeah.  You know, throw a little monkey wrench into the situation.  Right.  Into the season.  Ah, yeah.  Freaking King James missed that three-pointer at the end of the game last night.  I saw that clip.  Ah.  They jinx him now. 
[00:08:30]  Why?  Ah, they talk him up at the beginning of the game.  It's just a big thing.  They talk about how much the team is worth now just because of him and all his stats.  And they show him walking around every two seconds.  And then it's a jinx.  He's bigger than, you know, his name is bigger than him.  So then when he pulls a bonehead move like that, misses, it's over, Johnny.  Wasn't even a bonehead move.  What was it?  That's a hard shot to make.  Oh, not for King James. 
[00:09:00]  That was a hard shot to make last night.  Was it?  Yeah.  I didn't see the end of that game.  Ratings are really, really down for the NBA Finals, by the way.  Yeah.  Playing Cleveland-San Antonio?  Yeah.  It's two weird markets.  Yeah.  I know we're on in Cleveland, but as far as, like, the big picture goes with the NBA,  the NBA would like to see, like, New York-LA or Miami-LA or, you know, some of those bigger  markets.  Chicago.  Yeah.  You know.  I didn't even know it was championship until you were talking.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, the Spurs are, oh, whatever. 
[00:09:30]  They're going to win it all.  Bob was telling me about the cicada problem in Chicago.  Bob was?  Because Bob, our agent, yeah, you know, he's got family there, so he goes to Chicago a  lot, and apparently there's a bunch of cicadas there that come up every 17 years, which is  just the creepiest friggin' alien thing I've ever heard.  It's like that movie Pitch Black.  Can I stop you for a second?  When was he talking about cicadas?  I was with you all night.  I believe maybe it was our walk back. 
[00:10:00]  Mine and Bob stroll hand in hand back to the Parker.  I was too busy looking at Kira Sedgwick and saying, wow, that chick is hot.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yes, Kira Sedgwick.  And Kevin Bacon were in the same restaurant as us last night.  We had a power meeting with our super agent.  Super agent Bob Eman.  After a top secret meeting.  Top secret meeting.  Top secret meetings and power meetings and all sorts of crap going on behind the scenes.  We just want to do a dumb radio show. 
[00:10:30]  And in the booth across the way was Kevin Bacon and Kira Sedgwick.  And I was about to tell Anthony, wow, look at that chick.  She looks like a real young Kira Sedgwick.  Yeah.  This woman we were looking at last night at the restaurant was so hot, so sexy.  The eye she was giving turned out to be Kevin Bacon.  His back was toward me, so I didn't know it was even Kevin Bacon.  You had to point that part out.  There you go.  What a coincidence that young Kira Sedgwick-looking girl is with Kevin Bacon look-alike. 
[00:11:00]  I thought I was blown away.  I'm like, she doesn't look that good in movies or TV.  Yeah.  They should film all her parts right in that restaurant with that lightning because preferably as far away as we were.  I think we were the perfect distance.  Perfect distance for her to look fantastic.  You know something?  She looks good in person is what it is.  I don't know what they're doing to her on TV.  She does a show called The Closer. 
[00:11:30]  And I don't know.  She plays some kind of cop-type detective thing, woman, girl thing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But I see the ads, and she doesn't look as good on TV as she looks in person.  She was all like a little sex kitten thing.  She's flipping her hair around and putting her head on Kevin Bacon's shoulder.  And the eyes she was giving him, man.  They're making kissy face, and she's just giving lovey-dovey eyes.  And we're sitting at the table saying, I wonder how old they are. 
[00:12:00]  You think he's older?  How much older than her is he?  Is he our age?  I think he's a little older.  What about her?  She's got to be our age.  I think she's younger.  And then, oh, is BlackBerry getting on Internet Movie Database?  They're just trying to have a little dessert across the way.  And we're researching them.  They have no idea we're looking them up.  We're just researching on our various, like, handheld devices.  Having just dumb bets between us.  It's like, how do you spell Sedgwick?  I don't know.  Just put in The Closer.  I can't find it.  Put in Kevin Bacon, and then go to Spouse. 
[00:12:30]  Cross-reference.  It's like an episode of 24.  We're just, like, pounding the Internet.  This is what your pals, your shock jocks do.  Yeah.  When they're not doing it right on themselves.  They get all starstruck and try to figure out how old people are.  They're so pathetic.  So then it turned out you nailed Kevin Bacon.  Kevin Bacon, I figured.  We went back to Animal House, and we're like, all right, he was in Animal House, and that  was 76, 77.  77, yeah.  Kevin Bacon was in Animal House?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was like his first role.  So that was 30 years ago.  So I'm like, all right, he's got to be 50. 
[00:13:00]  But then Ant's like, no, I think I remember reading that he did that movie right out of  high school.  I'm like, right out of high school, he's doing Animal House?  No way.  That's crazy.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  So then we looked it up, and Ant nailed it.  He's 48.  Yeah.  Or he's going to be 48 in a few weeks, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And then we're like, all right, Kira Sedgwick now, okay, they've been married since 88.  All right, he probably married a little young.  Mm-hmm.  And then we guessed her age for the most part, 42, which is going to be 42 in a month.  I guessed older.  Yeah.  I guessed older just because I didn't want to look better.  Because she's been around forever. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, and I still can't get that picture of her on the TV out of my head.  Yeah.  She doesn't look as good as she does in real life.  She is so sexy in person, man.  Wow.  Yeah, her hair looked great.  Wow.  And then I followed them home.  You stalked them.  I ended up stalking people in my neighborhood.  We were talking outside.  Not intentionally.  And they passed right by us when they were leaving.  Yeah.  So they made the turn up the street, and we're still talking and talking.  So I go to Oaf.  I go, all right, go catch up to them and tell me how her ass looks. 
[00:14:00]  And I was just walking home, and I did catch up to them.  I thought they were long gone.  They walked slow.  It was pitch dark.  This is a sign of how famous you are.  It's pitch dark, and you got the restaurants, you know, Jimmy and our neighborhood, and  their outdoor cafes and stuff.  And everybody was turning around and freaking out that they saw them on the sidewalk.  And I'm like, how do they even know it's them?  It's really dark out.  They're pretty identifiable.  But they were getting recognized, and all the women were, oh, oh, look, they're still 
[00:14:30]  in line.  Oh, oh, Kevin Bacon.  What a man.  You could have just followed them home and played Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon on your  cell phone.  Right.  But, like, real loud so he could hear you.  I'm annoying with that tape.  So, anyway, the cicadas.  I'm sorry.  I went off on a tape.  Oh, that's okay.  I'd rather talk about that.  I went off the highway.  I took an exit.  Bob's cicada story.  Apparently running rampant. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Opie said he was with Ant.  Ant said he was in a hotel.  All right.  So what is this guy putting two and two together?  That we were having a mo relationship in a hotel?  Rich.  What are you getting at?  Rich?  Hey, Rich.  Well, Opie said that he was with Anthony all night, and then Anthony's talking about  being in a hotel room.  So I just want to know what's going on.  Well, you got us.  It is what it is.  We're secretly, you know, having man-on-man love. 
[00:15:30]  Man-love.  All right.  Who's the catcher?  You got us.  We switch off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's nothing predictable about it.  No.  No.  Except that someone's getting effed.  What a douche.  Sometimes I get to stand there and play towel boy.  Those are my favorite moments.  By the way, our phone number is 877-212-5762.  So the cicadas, I can't imagine that it was an exciting conversation back to the hotels  because you went the other way. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  Yes, we walked back.  And apparently...  Oh, by the way, Anthony actually took Bob, our super agent, back to his hotel room.  Yeah.  And they were having man-on-man love.  Poor Bob couldn't get a room.  New York City's booked up for some reason.  And there's graduations going on.  Yeah.  So there's no rooms available.  Yeah.  And poor Bob is just walking around from hotel to hotel.  Your room at the inn, nothing.  You know what's funny?  Bob has probably saved our jobs four or five times over the years. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, we pretty much went at the end of the night and said, Bob, sucks to be  you.  You're on your own, Bob.  Good luck to you, buddy.  Good luck to you.  I'm going back to my room, which probably has...  I could have called for a roll-away bed.  I could have maybe pulled out a couch.  He could have slept on that.  Sorry.  Officially, I got two places right now in Manhattan.  Yeah.  I said, well, good luck, Bob.  Where did he go?  By the way...  We don't know.  We just ditched him.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I'm moving from my old place to a new place.  That's why I have two places.  Thank goodness.  I don't want people to think I actually have two places that I keep up in Manhattan.  And put it this way.  I got the room in the first place because I didn't want to...  We were supposed to have a meeting yesterday at four.  Yeah.  That's when our meeting was supposed to be.  And it got delayed, delayed, delayed, and then kind of halfway postponed.  We met with other people.  But it was supposed to be over pretty quickly.  And I got the hotel room because I cannot drive out of the city during rush hour. 
[00:17:30]  I will kill somebody.  So I get a room and stay in.  It's kind of nice.  A little vacation from home.  A nice little short walk to the station in the morning.  I get to sleep in a little bit.  So it's nice.  By the time we left the restaurant, rush hour was over.  I easily could have went, Bob, take my room.  I'm just going to drive home.  I kept thinking that.  I kept thinking that in my head over and over.  And you would have been home in, be honest, a half hour? 
[00:18:00]  Maybe a half hour.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking, and I'm so selfish and greedy.  I'm just thinking, I could sleep another ten minutes in the morning.  That, to me, is more valuable than thinking of my agent strolling the streets at three in the morning,  trying to find a warm sidewalk, a warm grate over a subway.  When I left him, I noticed that he was taking his business shirt.  He took his tie off at the restaurant.  Yeah.  He took his jacket off. 
[00:18:30]  And he was rolling up his business shirt into kind of a belly shirt, hoping that would get him a room somewhere.  Maybe somebody would come and go, hey, you need company?  Hey, poor Bob.  I wonder what happened to him.  I don't know.  Ah, whatever.  We have a radio show to do.  He probably spent the night talking to a cicada.  He's sitting on his shoulder making a chirping noise.  He brought up the cicadas because his family is going to Chicago for a little while, and his wife is petrified of these things. 
[00:19:00]  And apparently, this is some kind of freak thing that happens.  And it's every 17 years, they mate and then die and burrow into the ground.  Like, you know, the males, I guess, all just die.  The females burrow into the ground, lay these eggs.  The eggs hatch, and these things live underground for 17 years.  And then they decide to pop up and just, like, take over the city where you've got to shovel them like a snow shovel off of sidewalks. 
[00:19:30]  They're falling like rain.  They're just dead everywhere.  And it's horrible.  We're on live in Chicago right now.  Yeah.  Chicago, call us.  Are you seeing cicadas falling from the sky right now?  Are you in a cicada storm?  I really want to know what's going on in Chicago with these.  And if this happens every 17 years, that's just a sick alien life form. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, look at it.  That's one of them.  Get out of here.  Is that actual size?  Iraq's got one on that's about two feet long.  Takes up the home monitor.  They bother you in the fact that they're a bug in huge numbers.  When you look around, there's something like, Bob gave me a nice statistic.  I'm sure it was doom and gloom.  It was.  It's something like a couple of million per acre. 
[00:20:30]  Get out of here.  Like, millions upon millions of these things just take over.  Well, we're going live to Chicago.  You know, they're an hour behind.  So, the sun's just coming up in Chicago.  Let's plunk down the audio and see what's going on in Chicago.  But the cicada's running rampant.  But it's got to be crazy audio here.  See, there's one.  No, it's just a cricket. 
[00:21:00]  Poor cricket.  It's just a cricket.  Oh, what an ugly big green bug.  That would scare the crap out of me.  I don't like big bugs like that.  I don't either.  Would you, if there were like a swarm of those all over the place, would you go outside?  I wouldn't if there was one.  If there was one in the neighborhood, I'd stay in until it was caught or killed.  All right.  Hey, for the early risers, we're going to do something a little special here. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, by the way, Friday.  Yes.  After this show, we're going to be outside on the sidewalk.  Yes.  Might be a big day.  I don't know.  Friday.  Might be a big day.  But I'll tell you this much.  Friday, we'll be out on the sidewalk after our radio show around 9 o'clock.  I think you're going to want to be out there.  And we're going to give away 100 tickets to the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour at Jones  Beach Saturday.  Oh!  We're going to give away 100 tickets Friday, right after the show, right outside this building 
[00:22:00]  on 57th Street, right around 9 o'clock.  100 tickets to see the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show this Saturday at Jones Beach out  there on Long Island.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Bob Kelly, one of the comedians performing, will be in studio today.  Also, Bob Saget, you get to see how dirty he is.  Frank Caliendo with all his great impressions.  You've got Jim Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Stephen  Lynch, Ant and I, the O&A Village with all sorts of things going on. 
[00:22:30]  The tailgating before the O&A Village.  An all-day event.  Tickets still on sale, right?  Yes.  Through Ticketmaster.com.  Or you could go to VirusTour, one word, on MySpace.  VirusTour.  I have to report the worst death I've ever heard of.  Maybe when I come back, I could do that.  Yeah, that's a great tease.  It's the worst death ever.  That's a great tease.  We'll do that next.  It makes cicadas look like child play.  It makes looking crushed by cicadas look like child play.  Speaking of which, let's go to Jimmy in Chicago.  Jimmy, we're trying to take a break, but what do you got on the cicadas? 
[00:23:00]  Not much, guys.  I love your show.  We love you out here in Chicago, man.  There are millions of cicadas.  I mean millions.  Wouldn't you look like a paintball war?  Oh, man, I didn't even think of that.  When you drive your car, they just must splatter everywhere.  They spread it like exploding golf balls, man.  It's insane.  But we love you out here in Chicago.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Jimmy.  When you say millions, where are these millions of cicadas?  Well, they're mainly in all in wood areas, like forest reserves and stuff.  You go along 94 and stuff like that.  I mean, just thousands. 
[00:23:30]  If you're on a motorcycle, you're completely screwed.  So if you're driving down 94, does your radiator get all clogged up?  I can't imagine.  Did you just go local for Chicago going down 94?  94.  Look at you.  Well, it's right by the woods.  Exactly, exactly, man.  It's just your grill is completely caked.  Your windshield is caked.  You try to hit the wipers.  It's just insane.  So, yeah.  It's got to be so nasty.  Just this yellow, orange, green crap smearing across your windshield. 
[00:24:00]  Look, Chicago, send some pictures in.  I'm not buying into this cicada thing.  Millions of cicadas all over the place.  Well, thanks, guys.  All right.  All right, man.  Where's the footage?  Where is it?  Here's the reality.  Bill in Chicago.  Bill, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm driving to the airport.  I've been waiting for these things to come out and kill everybody, but I haven't seen them yet.  Well, how could you not see them when that guy sees millions?  I think it's like a big blow-up dowel or something.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's somewhere between millions and none. 
[00:24:30]  Well, our quick survey has suggested it could be none or millions.  Go to Phil.  All right, let's go to Phil.  Thank you, Bill.  Phil.  Phil in Chicago.  How are you doing, my friends?  Phil.  Good morning, gentlemen.  No, Ned Ryerson, right?  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Phil?  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Now, Phil, you have...  No, say it right. 
[00:25:00]  Phil Connor?  Phil?  Chicago?  What's up?  Phil?  Chicago?  Cicadas?  Ned?  Every time I hear Phil, I have to say Ned.  Ned?  Watch.  Phil?  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Hey, come on.  I sure as heckfire want to hear about this.  He hung up.  He didn't like the bit.  He was angry.  I think most people didn't like that bit.  Look, we improv all the time.  We're retarded.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 
[00:25:30]  Give us a break, will you?  He had a story where he said, yeah, there's millions of them that he has to clean up.  Jimmy T, something after the break.  We'll talk about cicadas in Chicago, and we'll give away a pair of tickets right now to our  comedy show, Jones Beach, this Saturday, brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  A random caller.  Make sure you can use the tickets.  Make sure you're going to be close to the venue this Saturday, because we're all over  the country right now.  Phone number, 877-212-5762.  And if you don't win the tickets, keep in mind, we will have 100 tickets to give away 
[00:26:00]  Friday, right after this show, right outside the studio, here on 57th Street in Manhattan.  Okay?  Roy, more with Opie and Anthony, and we'll Jimmy Norton next.  Oh, thank you, Paula.  Hey, hey, these cicadas, I live up in Fox Lake by Blonnie's Island, and about 10 miles  away, my girlfriend, my boy, and they are the ugliest thing.  Uh-oh, they're eating her phone.  The cicadas are eating her cell phone. 
[00:26:30]  Paula, what happened?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, let's go.  So, you're up there at the lake there.  Yeah, they're pretty bad out here, but I don't see millions of them driving.  I'm driving now.  Well, I hope you don't see one of them driving.  I don't think that would be very safe.  Well, it says you have to shovel away the cicadas here.  The what?  It says you have to shovel away the cicadas.  There's so many.  I'm not kidding.  They just drop like flies.  Well, like cicadas.  I'm off the driveway.  It's nasty. 
[00:27:00]  They are nasty little bugs.  I want to go to Chicago and see cicadas.  I hear they're loud, too.  Really?  Well, we can send you some.  Yeah, mail us some cicadas, please.  You want us to send you some?  Yeah, I just want to annoy Tom all day long, I just decided.  Are you going to throw cicadas at him?  Yeah, start mailing cicadas to us here in New York.  We will.  I will.  I'll send you some cicadas out there.  Tom has a way of taking all fun out of what we're trying to do, so let's mail him some cicadas.  All right.  There you go.  All right, Paula. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you.  You guys are awesome.  I listened to you guys back in Cleveland.  William in Chicago.  What's going on?  Why when she was such a fan?  Yes, William.  Yeah, they don't, the cicadas, okay, they're about between two and three inches long.  They're very reasonable where they're at.  They don't eat, bite, sing, drink, anything.  All they do is mate and die.  They live for about 14 days.  They've already peaked.  They're already on their way out. 
[00:28:00]  At my house where I live, the bottom of the trees, you cannot see the grass, but where I work 15 miles away, there's not even one.  So they're very, if the ground gets tore up at all, they're dead.  You won't even see any, but some areas just got millions of them.  And then they lay eggs and they sit there for 17 years?  Yeah, it's my third time seeing them.  So I saw them, I think it was like 11 and then whatever, in the 20s and then this year.  So next year, no cicadas?  I'm sorry?  Next year, no cicadas?  No, there'll be a few strays.  There are every year, but they're just like, you know, random ones. 
[00:28:30]  They're the dummies.  They don't know what year it is.  They're like the homeless of the cicadas.  But like, literally, literally, you can't hear yourself think outside by my house.  You know, it's just that loud.  It's like, remember that movie, One of the Worlds, that weird movie that was a long, long time ago?  Yeah.  You know, that's the sound.  You can't even hear yourself think.  That's how loud it is.  Wow.  Thanks.  Love your show.  Oh, thank you, man.  Yeah, bye.  Look at all these people calling from Chicago, listening on CKG.  What's up, Kenny?  Hey, guys, what's happening? 
[00:29:00]  Love you.  Thank you, Kenny.  Hey, yeah, I drive a garbage truck out here in the northwest suburbs, and I can tell you  right now, you're driving a truck, you got the windows open, and even the radio on, the  sound is deafening.  Really?  It'll drown out trucks?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's like, it does.  It drowns out the truck.  I'll walk away from the truck, and all you hear is cicadas.  Well, E-Rock has audio.  You got audio of cicadas?  Wow, E-Rock.  Let's go.  Well, it's out in, like, Park Bridge.  Park Bridge has got it really fast. 
[00:29:30]  That is the creepiest crap I've ever heard.  Sounds like a soundtrack to a horror movie.  Yeah.  Like The Grudge or something.  That's like an invasion of something.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny, thank you.  Bye, guys.  Kenny in Chicago.  There you go.  Mommy.  Mommy. 
[00:30:00]  Mommy.  Mommy.  Wow, that is really loud.  Kill Jimmy.  Kill, kill, kill.  Kill, kill, kill.  Kill, kill, kill.  Kill, kill, kill.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Kill, Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. 
[00:30:30]  Someone's not going to be happy with us.  That's creepy.  I tuned them in this morning.  They don't even prepare.  They're just making noises over cicadas.  They're making noises.  We're paying them how much for this?  So that's what Chicago sounds like?  Yeah.  I guess.  all right uh jimmy to you so uh i think i think i know what you're getting at here but we have a  horrible death that happened overnight it's called the worst death ever you're gonna call it the  worst death ever no one's ever suffered a worst death and i mean you want to go back to the time 
[00:31:00]  of of of of 15th century christianity when they were torturing people right worst death spanish  inquisition deaths uh jimmy let's challenge our listeners worst death ever you're saying this is  the worst death ever doesn't get any awful of this all right maybe uh the listeners could come up  with a better worst death ever okay they think they can by the way keep it fun you idiots yeah  yeah keep it fun well i'll tell you about my grandma there's a long drawn out bout with cancer 
[00:31:30]  and she yeah okay that sounds horrible but could you keep it a little odd like this story and they're  about to uh read her last rights and cicadas fell on her and crushed her see we're keep we're gonna  try to keep it fun like uh like the story jimmy's about to read grandma grandma actually was dying of  brain cancer and she finally got this moment of of of awareness and she was ready to blurt out her 
[00:32:00]  last words and all we heard was cicadas the cicadas drown out grandma's last words and she said the  treasure is hidden and cicadas came in and come here the treasure my fortune  what grandma why i'm sorry she's gone son of a bitch and bugs 
[00:32:30]  every 17 years you got to be reminded you're broke i'm picturing uh grandma dying of cancer  she was a miserable woman so her so her kids weren't around yeah she spent her last days in a room  dying of cancer two weeks to get out of bed and she was able to get out of bed just to open up the  window in chicago to get a little fresh air maybe fresh air maybe the last breath of fresh air listen  to the birds tweeting maybe a beautiful day a sunrise before she meets god before the grim reaper comes in 
[00:33:00]  with his sickle that's the only way to say god now you know god god before she meets god she opens up  the window get some fresh air and all of a sudden the cicadas come flying oh my goodness  she's too weak to get them off her body fight them off as they eat her eyeballs they just start  eating eating old grandma nothing but bones slowly but surely oh and it takes a little time because 
[00:33:30]  you know grandma's skin's a little rough little rawhidish at this point oh but they nibble a little  gamey they nibble a little piece off just when you got millions of them they could probably take  apart a grandma in no time well i'm hoping it took a while what do they eat leaves right uh skin  skin human skin okay all right we find out something new every day about these cicadas  they're the zombie cicadas worst death ever yes jimmy uh a long island landscaper was crushed to 
[00:34:00]  death yesterday by a commercial lawnmower well that doesn't sound that bad or out of the ordinary  probably taking it off the truck with another landscaper it could crush him i've seen a lot of  those landscapers those commercial mowers weigh maybe a hundred pounds that's it i mean maybe  and if it hits you right on the head it's probably pretty instantaneous so i don't see how that's the  worst death you're you're a liar yeah why is it worst death ever um this is how you know that this  your your life is godless crushed together by a lawnmower that toppled on him as he fell into a cesspool 
[00:34:30]  okay i don't need a laugh now we're hurt on long now you're getting horrible he was in the back in  comac and when his mower suddenly plunged into a grass obscured cesspool filled with about three feet  of sewage he died sewage is the polite way of saying of course human waste he died pinned to a wall of 
[00:35:00]  human waste by his own lawnmower by his own lawnmower that fell through a hole that what was  bugs bunny put the little blanket of grass over a hole what the hell why was a cesspool just covered  with a little grass you would think they would warn the landscaper yeah uh you might want to stay away  from that area over there maybe stake it off or was it a sinkhole that appeared now they said it was  a cesspool he fell into a cesspool and was crushed how awful is that pinned down by your mower while you 
[00:35:30]  drown in human waste yeah your face and your teeth probably scraped the wall as you were falling in  oh god i gotta say that is a horrible horrible way to go it's never been a worse way to go  being crushed by a lawnmower because it's a nice day out yesterday yeah cutting the grass  probably sang a tune cutting the grass i don't know if that's worst death ever time  worst death ever i'm gonna challenge that's pretty bad what could be worse than being in human feces 
[00:36:00]  yeah uh and being crushed at the same time well you have to tell other people in heaven you have to  see your relevance what about the guy i'm gonna have to get the story but his arm got caught in like a  chocolate making machine that's fun and then his whole body was dragged into the machine and he died in  in a vat of chocolate that's a yummy death that's yummy what's that is yummy kind of like the cesspool  uh guy color wise yeah they both look the same but i don't know i don't know i think chocolate doesn't 
[00:36:30]  make it as bad as human waste is what it is well chocolate's fun well uh we challenged jimmy today  worst death ever we'll see what the listeners come up with okay boston you can't uh you can't uh  contribute to this because i think the show just started for you so i'm sorry oh right with the  delay yeah although they do have a doozy huh although they do have a doozy what do you mean 
[00:37:00]  you're just driving to work and a giant steel plate falls on your car and crushes you yeah that's  worst death ever that's that's a pretty bad one but quick huh quick we get the manhole covers here in  new york that just pop up and crush every once in a while or you walk your dog you get electrocuted  because he takes a leak on a pole that's not the wire that's a bad one or we had one uh uh you know  those great someone's walking over a great felt 25 feet to their death i don't walk on them huh  sometimes you're forced to though my mother fell through one when she was very young i know she 
[00:37:30]  wasn't she told you how she did when she was a little girl she fell through a wooden one no she  wasn't didn't you think did she really how far did she fall i don't know she didn't die well  you think that led to her being uh swinger oh i don't know what she fell on to con ed worker  hey toots bermuda right now my father's got a polaroid out oh digital camera trying to hook 
[00:38:00]  up to the computer but he says mass mailing up one of those email lists or digital photos  oh go to swinger site and just see oh imagine that you're just trolling the one night if you  want to listen to the show yesterday jimmy is uh suspecting that his parents might be uh swingers  just because they they're vacationing with another couple in bermuda bermuda just sounds like it could  be the swingers capital of the world for like old swingers yeah yeah where you go there and like  the people that are into that lifestyle know where to go and had a great theory about some of these 
[00:38:30]  sexual practices like the uh uh how do you say it the uh leave the for the young oh yeah that's one  of my favorites let's just put it this way there's things you do sexually that make a lot more sense  when you're young just meant for the young right there are things you do in bed that are meant for the  young meant for younger people like like when you uh kneeling and you like look up and you see 
[00:39:00]  the other person's toes and you're like oh well yeah things like that there's the yeah yeah there  there's a certain uh things where perhaps you're you're uh you're looking at the girl um and she's  looking at the headboard um let's just put it this way because uh we're hurt in buffalo close enough 
[00:39:30]  to canada you're both watching the hockey game that old gag yeah yeah that old gag that one some of  these things are just best left of age some of these things you should just leave leave to the young  leave to the young you don't want to see old turkish taffy swinging  looks like turkish taffy and a couple of meatballs just swinging uh let's say uh hi to jeff in 
[00:40:00]  rhode island he's going to challenge uh worst death ever jimmy okay uh jeff go ahead hey guys love  you i love the show you know thank you uh vince mcmahon's death was more tragic than that well jimmy  you're right vince mcmahon was uh incinerated it's looking like um in a limousine yeah his limo blew  up now you might be saying oh my god you're kidding why haven't i read this in the newspapers  or uh seen it on fox a fox news alert cnn this should have been all over the place uh but apparently 
[00:40:30]  just the wwe website is reporting the uh untimely death of vince mcmahon uh still speculative though  uh because they have not found a body and his family is gonna have make statements today statements  are being made today i'm sure those statements will be picked up by the ap of course uh sam is  following this story very closely is our uh correspondent our wwe correspondent sam but i'm  thinking we might have to take him off of this because he's a little too emotionally involved 
[00:41:00]  he's our wrestling douche okay take off wrestling  uh now you you're you're still pretty shaken up about this whole thing yes uh last night's ecw  broadcast that taz did uh play by play for was in memoriam oh it was yes was taz like a little  broken up about the whole thing yeah i mean that's interesting probably a time to reflect after 
[00:41:30]  yesterday yeah okay all right thank you sam because he was on our show yesterday and he  basically told everyone he doesn't give a crap as long as he continues to get paid by the mcmahon  he just wants to get paid and he was worried that uh his car might blow up because it was about 70  feet away from his limo i hope you heard that on our show yesterday but yesterday it was a he took a  different tone huh yeah i think he might have been he wasn't the sarcastic uh bastard that he was on  our show yesterday gave it some thought he was in a state of shock yesterday morning oh okay some  people are going to denial is what it is and that must have been what he was in when he was laughing 
[00:42:00]  about it and talking about how goofy it was and how old the limousine was that he got into and how  the leg coming in and out of the limo looked like a fake leg uh but uh there it is i just watched the  explosion again my god sam's turning his head he can't even look at it anymore um so what's what's  the latest now on the investigation well can i ask sam a question are you going to ignore the fact that  we did our own investigating we called wilkes-barre the police department we found out that they 
[00:42:30]  actually filmed fish mcmahon's death a day before it actually happened we're not even kidding we called  the police department down there and wanted a statement from the police department the police  department statement was that was filmed on sunday and then apparently monday is when they they showed  it now sam now raw raw is broadcast live i think the police department were probably uh not informing  you of the correct information because that just couldn't be correct well that's probably why as sam 
[00:43:00]  was going to report the fbi has now moved in yes to take over the investigation they're not a good  police department there oh okay so so now the fbi will fact is taz had nothing to worry about as far  as his car goes because the explosion happened the day before when there were no other cars in the  area why would there be when there's stunt people and uh... pyro coordinators around a vehicle and  do realize they flew stunt people into wilkes-barre i don't think that that was first not the movie 
[00:43:30]  capital of the world they actually had to fly these people in well whoever flew them in i think is  probably my prime suspect no more suspect uh... was there any clues last night as to who might have  been responsible for this well i couldn't watch the whole broadcast last night why it was on late  at night and i get sleepy this seemed sam plus uh... it's too emotional right now oh okay all right  that i'd rather hear that than hear maybe you're a little too tired to watch since you're so emotional 
[00:44:00]  what's the latest on vince mcdonald's death in this well his body has not been recovered but it could have  easily been incinerated yeah so you're saying that the inside of that limo could have reached temperatures  uh... of a crematorium yeah or um... probably uh... atomic explosion like hiroshima could have been  uh... there's a there's not a fire hot enough to incinerate that ego of his okay at least his ego  would have found his ego at least his ego lives on yeah not a bone or anything nothing yet nothing 
[00:44:30]  yet but the fbi is on the case all right and what else were the fbi agents that showed up  were they dressed in fbi attire but really very muscular guys well you have to be very strong to be an fbi  oh is that it did  were their muscles bulging through the uniforms as they walked out  uh...  and the mcmahon family will issue a statement on the uh... wwe website yeah uh... later 
[00:45:00]  video statement or just a written statement because i would like to see their emotional makeup i want to see who's upset about this  when does the rest of the world pick up on this story yeah when does uh... fox news go all day with just coverage on this investigation  i don't know i think they're probably so busy with all the big news stories that are happening they figure they'll let the mcmahons have their time  oh you're saying they're sympathetic yes oh okay they're letting them mourn a little yes before they move in like the vultures they are yes and and take it wow this is the first time i've seen that yeah and nicole smith was still warm but uh... 
[00:45:30]  uh... vince mcmahon they're gonna let uh... him rest in peace for a while they haven't even found his body and yeah you know they're they're giving it some time before they well thank god the fbi has such uh...  crucial evidence as the videotape of the entire event yes in hd thank god thank god all right there's the update on uh... vince mcmahon's death as of said the wrestling douche expert what do you wear when you go to bed do you wear little footy pajamas no i picture him in like a one a one-piece footy 
[00:46:00]  pajama thing that buttons up the side with the hatch in the back so he's got to make poopy sam was getting the lace on vince mcmahon's death as he was eating chicken fingers and the rest of his yeah eight-year-old diet his infant diet that he eats yeah with the hatches used at other convenient times somebody who may have had a little too much whiskey watch i guarantee this is gonna be good guarantee this is gonna be good and i i don't know the answer ahead of time yeah what did you have for dinner last night last night oh i heated up uh... 
[00:46:30]  i heated up a slice of pizza and had some doritos with that  and a glass of milk he eats like an eight-year-old  and a glass of milk  you got a lot of parents that have eight-year-olds out there that listen to us  they're laughing even harder because this kid how old do you know  twenty-three  twenty-three still eats like he's eight years old  nothing but chicken nuggets  no healthy stuff  it's nothing  fish sticks  and you eat fish sticks  yeah fish sticks

[00:49:30]  she did  well that is a horrible way to go  yeah  that's pretty gross  but it is a little child  yeah man  worst death ever  is fun stuff  the baby had fun  she giggled after  this is supposed to be a fun bit  thank you jen  leave it to boston  and wreck our bit  yeah  alright we gotta take a break  it's Opie and Anthony  lots going on  on the Opie and Anthony show  where's that video  I told you to keep up  oh  come on  E-Rock  thank you 
[00:50:00]  we were talking about  well now we call it yuffing  yuffing  but it's yiffing  I think it's yiffing  we got the wrong info  at the time  so now we like to just say  it's yuffing I guess  but  we were talking about this  virtual reality game  second life  I don't even know  if it's a game really  yeah it's an online experience  online experience  sure  you know there are things  it's an online world  it's called a second life  you make a character  and live your life  virtually online  with a bunch of other people 
[00:50:30]  it's huge amounts of people  you do business  you build places  you buy real estate  you open businesses  you know it's just this  second life  is what it is  but some people  like in our own real life  just have to be asses  sexual deviants  and asses  no I don't think  this one's a sexual  deviant thing  I think  what  I think it's a guy  that's just being an ass  and ruining everyone's  gaming experience  yes  there's a difference  I truly believe 
[00:51:00]  this guy's not a deviant  he's just  he just wants to be an ass  so for all the people  he's ruining everyone's  good time  trust me  we're gonna  we're gonna give you  a video  that you're gonna check out  all day today  and you're gonna pass on  to your friends  yeah  absolutely  so if you're in front  of a computer  go to  we gotta give him  a plug today  go to YouTube  and put in  free hugs  in second life  and check out  the video that comes up 
[00:51:30]  you wanna explain  the video Anthony  we can't get enough  of yuffing  or yiffing videos  at this point  obviously it's from  the perspective  of another character  and you're looking  into the game world  and it's amazing  the environments  that this game has  inside buildings  everything from  inside outside  inside clubs  grass parks  the beach  the beach  inside clubs  in the woods  camping  there's just a multitude 
[00:52:00]  of locations  where people go  to experience  a little bit of fun  camaraderie  with new friends  that they've made  and then  there's this guy  who made a character  that walks around  holding up a sign  that says  free hugs  over his head  explain the guy  before you  give away the  well the guy  is a big fat guy  his character  is big  and fat  and bald  and bald  and he's got  a weird looking  like  like  like Tor Johnson 
[00:52:30]  face  by the way  do you have to  I know  I was gonna go there  but the guy's  got a dead guy's  ligament in his knee  we'll get to that  in a second  we welcome Bob Kelly  to the show  if Bob Kelly  was animated  you would look  similar to this guy  Bob  oh god  that's terrible  in every way  by the way  when you see  this video  you know  call the show  because I think  you're gonna be  laughing hysterically  it's free hugs  in second life  yeah  on YouTube  but dad  continue  beer belly  don't forget 
[00:53:00]  the beer belly  a huge beer belly  and he's completely  naked  completely naked  but not only  completely naked  he is  very well endowed  to the point  of freakishness  to the point  of  it's  it's  it's beyond  anything  that could actually  be in reality  it's probably  three feet  yeah  three and a half feet  yeah  it's just ridiculous  this animation  and as big  and as big 
[00:53:30]  around as his neck  right  and uh  and he's walking  around the game  fire  yeah  and he just  walks around  thrusting  his uh  pelvis around  so as he's  doing this  uh  the physics  in this game  seems to work  very well  because as you  would move  something forward  if there was  something hanging  from what you're  moving forward  it would flop  up and down  and up and down  it would pretty much  hit you in the forehead  right  if you did it right  an angry elephant seal  yes 
[00:54:00]  and that seems to be  what this guy is doing  but he doesn't just do it  standing there  no  he walks up to people  that just want to have fun  being part of this game  and shakes it in their face  he is just  but then he'll do it  he'll do it to inanimate objects  a fire  is this a montage  of this guy doing this  campfire  and now he's at the beach  and people are just sitting  in beach chairs  and he goes up  and starts hitting people  with it  as he's holding 
[00:54:30]  this big free hugs sign  over his head  that's what makes it  like you said  he put it through a sign  that has a big mouth open  what makes it  is the fact that he's  wandering around  with the free hugs sign  yeah  just an ass  ruining everyone's  gaming experience  there they are  sitting in their beach chairs  as he is just  smacking them  and there's an animated  character just slapping his face  like get away from me  yeah  and then there's another guy  with his own problem  at the beach 
[00:55:00]  what an ass  there you go  so  have fun with that  free hugs  in second life  by the way  don't go anywhere today  we got  I believe audio  of Paris Hilton  making a phone call  in jail  oh  exclusive  yeah  we're trying to confirm  if it's real or not  but it's very low  it's absolutely real  it came from the internet  it's very very low  we're trying to enhance  the audio 
[00:55:30]  so we can see  what it's all about  okay  alright  why can't they get those  to actually sound right  because it was picked up  it was picked up sometimes  on something that's not  it's picked up from  like a third party thing  I hate that  it's like you gotta listen  and it's crackly  well the other problem is  it's being dubbed  so many times  or getting you know  copies  oh like an old  jerky boys take  yeah exactly  so it's getting  the quality's going down  but we think we have  a pretty good copy  I can rebuild it  so hopefully we'll have  that on the radio  in the next 10 or 15 minutes  Bob Kelly in studio 
[00:56:00]  Bobby how you doing  and he limped in  yeah he limped in again  with that god damn  knee of his  I can't wait for the day  that you're walking normally  I don't remember you  walking normally anymore  yeah I can't wait  for the day either  Steve was like  you want to do a call  I'm like no  I want to come in  I want to get out  I've been in the house  for two and a half weeks  I'm sorry I haven't  come by and see you  I've been busy  yeah thanks  what does that mean  I feel bad  I'm meaning to come by  and see you and the dogs

[00:57:30]  I just pick him up  over my head  I go look at you  I just hold him  under his little arms  I shake him around  I hold him by my head  and I go  look at you  he used to sit in my recliner  and pick his nose  yeah here's what I've heard  he used to sit there  and pick his nose  we'd eat lunch  everything would be cool 
[00:58:00]  and then Jim would always  pass out in my recliner  and my dogs would  he'd be right on  I'm just sleeping with him  it was just awful  and then you look over  and he would  he would pick his nose  and feed it to my dog  why not  so that's  that's the secret right there  that is awful  there's something in your  snot that the dog  can't wait to get  you would feed your boogers  to his dog  well who wouldn't  that is such a violation  of your property  but the thing is  is that I actually  I tried it  it's hilarious  because they really 
[00:58:30]  don't know  that it's a booger  they love it  it's almost  they have  like my dog  actually sat  everything I taught him  with a biscuit  he did with a booger  like it was a little  like a little biscuit  or a chew toy  yeah but I'd pick  you know  like a regular  little boogie boogie  he picks like  half of his brain  and then he  he swings it around  his finger  until it wraps around  like a piece of gum  and then he feeds it  to my dog  the dog actually  choked on one  of his boogers  he wraps around 
[00:59:00]  his finger  like a tetherball  oh god  stop it  by the way  Steven from Bayshore  on the instant feedback  you can get to  the instant feedback  through our website  Bob  is Bob able  to walk better  or does he still blimp  that's a good one  that's kind of funny  that's a good one  actually  have you gained weight  since this happened  since the last time  we saw you  no pretty much the same  oh yeah  yeah pretty much the same 
[00:59:30]  I didn't  no you look just as fat  I didn't give  oh  Jesus Christ  so let's  for the newbies  I mean Bob was on  tourgasm  with Dane Cook  on HBO  and he broke your knee  you know  for everybody on HBO  yeah  with the famous clip  we have the famous clip  how many years ago  was that  it was two years ago  Jesus Christ  and his knee's been  effed up since then  you guys were doing  a little touch football  do we have the clip  there are veterans  that have been shot  in the knee  with a 50  time out  and they can walk  what were you doing  on the cell phone  E-Rock  oh boy  oh no  I need you 
[01:00:00]  yeah we're having  problems with this  computer here  getting the audio out  so I was talking  with Mars  trying to get this  working  alright  I apologize  but can you get  the Bob Kelly clip  at least  it's a bit  we do  I would  E-Rock  unfortunately one day  was explaining  himself  and was so nervous  he was drinking  fluid  so now every time  he talks  Ant's gotta do  the fluid thing  yeah  he gets nervous  and his mouth  gets dry  so in the middle  of the conversation 
[01:00:30]  he drinks something  and he's like  but he drinks things  that make your mouth  dry like iced tea  he's like  well I was getting  the thing  up at the  and it was  that's a little  nervous thing  he does  he's all nervous  and drinking  he might have  just did it once  but toss it  that's what  oh it happens  every time  and it's just  really distractingly  loud  he might have just  been thirsty  we don't even know 
[01:01:00]  but who cares  magnifying glasses  of the zits of life  exactly  I like that  so  do you have  the clip theory  E to the rock  what's wrong  with that computer  why don't you get  that fixed  that always works  I love people  that  reverse the polarity  just start  punching the keyboard  with one finger  that'll fix it  get that fixed  he really was  just banging  on the keyboard  like a chimp  what is wrong 
[01:01:30]  oh no  he's using his thumb  he's never wanted  a piece of equipment  to work  more in his life  what do you got  you tell him fan  it's not working  it's not working  we don't have it  on disc  alright we'll find  it on disc  anyway  just kick me  in the other knee  and I'll do it again  that's just a little  sound  that's Bob Kelly  breaking his knee  man  while filming  tourgazm with  Dane Cook  for HBO  and your knee  has been effed up 
[01:02:00]  ever since  and the famous  I broke my knee  man  I broke my knee  man  hold my hand  hold my hand  hold my hand  hold my hand  hold my hand  hold my hand  you can't even  get the word  Hannah  hold my hand  you think we've  heard the clip  enough Bob  I think  that's perfect  love it  hold my hand  hold my hand  I wish I was there  so I could just  lean down  and slap Bob's  face completely  you know 
[01:02:30]  if it was a  different crew  of comics  it would have  been a different  outcome  if it was Patrice  you and Voss  it would have  been a definitely  different outcome  there would have  been no ambulance  you would have  sat there  and let me  just rot  for an hour  just laughing  at you  he would have  put like  a wood plank  against my  each inside  of my leg  on the outside  and just taped  it and told  me to get  back on the bus  he would have  been waiting  for vultures  to come around  circling  he would have  kept touching  it  is it right  here  hold my hand 
[01:03:00]  I like the  other one  I can't remember  what you were  saying  but you were  running out of  breath  it hurts  wait what  were you saying  help me out  you gotta remember  I don't know  I know that  after I said  hold my hand  I went  please  please  did you  please  don't leave  don't leave  sorry  trying off my mic  my E-rock  drinking bit  soaked the entire  area  I see that  so Bob got  surgery for his  knee  what was the  official damage  the original one  was I just tore 
[01:03:30]  my ACL  and super strained  my super strained  I really strained  super strained  am I superhero  I super strained  I am  my MCL  that's what you do  when you try to tie  your shoes  I like  Opie's technique  is different this morning  yes  it's almost like  it's almost like  he's like  like Catskills  that's what you do  when you tie  your shoes  in the morning  I was just excited  to say that 
[01:04:00]  you had two good ones  alright  the first time  what happened  was I tore it  so it was still  it was hanging on  by like a piece  of ligament  and when I went in  the doctor  whatever the doctor  was  this jerk  said  he just went in  and did some operation  that was supposed  to heal it  two years later  I go back in  I didn't have an ACL  for two years  the guy did an operation  that they do  on shoulders  like eight years ago  what  they did on shoulders 
[01:04:30]  so the technique  they did  to help Bob's knee  is a technique  they don't use anymore  and when they did use it  they were using it  on shoulders  not knees  where did you get  this doctor from  off the internet  you really did right  I typed in knee  did you really  oh my god  I needed a ceiling fan  knee ceiling fan  try to find them  both in the same building  and the guy you got  has to sell  ceiling fans  on the side  because he's not  making enough money  as a doctor  right  yeah 
[01:05:00]  I got a great  ceiling fan  that has a remote  and everything  a great ceiling fan  and a foam knee  thanks doc  so that's the truth  though  I should have known  something was wrong  because after the surgery  he didn't call me again  you know what I mean  like usually the doctor  will call me  and what you're doing  it went okay  after the surgery  he was gone  he wasn't even there  nobody was there  to say you're cool  they just gave me  a couple crackers  and booted me  and Bob you really  got him from the internet  yeah I went on the internet  don't you have a regular doctor  that could refer you  to somebody 
[01:05:30]  well this is what happens  is when you go  to get a doctor  it's not like  you can just go  I thought you could  it's a doctor  you took an oath  and they're all the same  oh my god  I never had to go  to a doctor before  doctor's a doctor  you went to school  for 20 years  for a knee thing  you know how to do  a knee thing  and apparently  that's not the way  it is  I went in  I went from  one doctor  who didn't take  my insurance  they sent me  to another doctor  who didn't take  my insurance  and then this guy  took my insurance  great  and I went in  and he was all  you know  I had this young guy  who was like learning  it was almost like 
[01:06:00]  being at Applebee's  with a new waiter  and the other waiter  was walking behind them  I had that set up  in Philly  this past weekend  and they're teaching him  yeah  you got the sidecar waitress  yeah  he's all nervous  she just follows  the real waitress around  yeah  and then she does like  they allow her to like  get water for you  or more bread  or something  that's all they allow you  to do  now make sure  tell him the specials  make sure you tell him  the specials  yeah  okay  thank you  that's the doctor  I'm all nervous  that's the doctor  you had  great  first of all  when you get a doctor 
[01:06:30]  to do any operation  make sure he has  gray hair  yeah  he's just old  and he just  he's been doing it  for a long time  don't get some  young guy  with a colic  I don't know  how to deal  with this  this problem  it was just awful  this guy  so I went into  this new doctor  and this guy  basically looked  at my MRI  and was like  you have no ACL  I can't even see it  he's like  what  he goes  what's this guy's name  he wanted his name  he wanted the old MRI  he was going to call him up  and you know  be like  try to get your ACL back  what was he going to do  what did the original doctor do 
[01:07:00]  he went in with a laser  and fake surgery  no he  well apparently  because there wasn't  enough ligament  left to heat  you're supposed  to heat it up  and that makes it  it tightens the ligament up  sure  but you can only  apparently this worked  on shoulders  for like six months  did he go into a trance  and put his two fingers  in your knee  and pull out a tumor  like a Mexican  chicken doctor  like one of those  one of those  faith healers  the amazing Randy  yes  I'm with you 
[01:07:30]  and it's just like  a cotton ball  with like black  and red paint  on it  and he often  believed in that  type of thing  yes  that's what he had done  to cure his cancer  and it did work  yeah  he's still alive somewhere  he's just waiting  to come back  anyway Bob  go ahead  well actually  when he gave the  you know  he figured out  what was wrong  with him  he threw chicken bones  on the ground  he was like  it's your ACL  I was like  alright  that's crazy  so Bob picked him up  and started nibbling  on him  so the new doctor  went in and went 
[01:08:00]  there's a real good  and you can hear  a fan in the  background cracking  yeah  Bob  eating  so the new doctor  went in  and was pissed  at the work  the other guy did  yeah this new doctor  did the Jets  he's like  he does a lot  of football players  and pro athletes  McEnroe  he stepped up a bit  yeah  yeah absolutely  he went from  Dr. Frankenstein  to like a real guy  I wish it was  the Pats  but whatever  it was kind of  annoying  looking up  and seeing the Jets  the old doctor  did the Jets  but the gang  who sang  I wish you would 
[01:08:30]  have told him  you're a Patriots fan  he would have  gave you just  a little something  different in there  he would have  put your leg  on backwards  right  so anyway  yeah so he  he went in  he  this guy  he was great  he was a little  he was a little  too you know  he was a little  too confident  he was like  this Asian dude  Mr. Lee  I just was hoping  he didn't listen  to my  I was like  oh please  you wake up  you have like  no leg  you just remove  it from the thigh  yeah  throw your CD  at your face  I'd just be shorter 
[01:09:00]  and he did something  to my eyes  so what happened  sweetie  um  it's good to hear  it's good to hear  wait you said  new one  you got the new one  is that Anthony  I thought it was  soap  no I don't  I'm not the only one  oh yeah the new one  here's the new one  everyone makes fun of you  yeah  where's the new one  Stan  I have it  under here  what  damn it  timing's everything  I don't know  now it's  but we had an opportunity  to finally play

[01:12:00]  Bob Kelly  one of  nine comedians  you'll see on that stage  we're in the middle  of talking about  Bob's latest surgery  so  to get to the  bottom of this  you got the operation  I got the new operation  the new operation  is doing very well  and we learned that  that you have a dead guy's  ligament in your body  that's gotta be creepy  yeah  it was either that  or take my own ligament  which hurts  from where  from like a hamstring  or something  which hurts twice as much  and takes twice as long 
[01:12:30]  to recover  yeah  and then they said  I was like  what's the only difference  between taking mine  and taking some dead guys  and they were like AIDS  no  yeah  the AIDS and HEP  they can test for that  yeah but they test it  they nuke it  they do everything  but it's still  it's still in some cases  like he gave me the percentage  oh it's probably ridiculous  yeah I know  and you know my  55%  no he didn't let me finish  he jumped in 55%  it's like nothing  it's like  a little more than 
[01:13:00]  half the people get AIDS  half the people get AIDS  hey  you might get AIDS  you might not  but at least you can walk  you'll have AIDS  you'll be able to walk  to the clinic  I uh  yeah he  they said that to  Matt Frost  they said  he almost died  from the same surgery  he went in  and uh  like a million and one  has this happen to him  after his surgery  he got uh  blood clots  and it worked its way  up to his lungs  oh  and three days after  because they told him  don't move  after the surgery  so he's just lying in bed  he's  he's a nut anyways  after September 11th 
[01:13:30]  he's just freaking  you know  about everything  so the doctor said  don't move  he didn't move  I don't even think  he blinked  for like three days  he just lied to  like a mummy  and he got blood clots  in his leg  uh  and worked up  way up to his  uh  his lungs  and if he didn't go  to the hospital  he would have been dead  I didn't know  there was something wrong  his back  he was  his back of his calf  swelled up  and uh  it was like bruised  and he was just  in just excruciating pain  so he was like  I gotta go  there's something else wrong  so uh  he went in  and  man 
[01:14:00]  yeah so there's like  there's always that one chance  that you know  there's like  I'm one in a million  there's a percentage  that you know  this dead guy  even though they nuked it  and fried it  and cooked it in olive oil  he's gonna get you  that he's gonna get me  that he's gonna get you  in death  are you having creepy dreams  or anything  yeah  I don't know if I'm a fan  of uh  dead guy parts  it's creepy right  yeah  I had a dream  he's having dreams  he's an architect  and he has three sons  and three daughters  yeah I don't know 
[01:14:30]  if I would mess  with that stuff  but it's just  it's just like  a piece of  a piece of rubber  they just drill holes  in your bone  and stick it in  and tie it off  but you know  it's from a dead guy  that's gotta be  a little creepy  yeah it's a little creepy  that guy like  lived a life  he had like  that ligament  that ligament  that was there  had like  an 80 year old man  no it's from a  he's a 40 year old man  40  yeah she wouldn't  tell me what color  how'd he die  why couldn't he  they wouldn't tell me that 
[01:15:00]  they only told me  she got mad at me  because I was asking  what'd he do  was he smart  you know  did he play  was he smart  it's not a brain transplant  yeah what do you think  you're gonna get  a little smarts out of it  I hope he's not dead  he just lost his leg  in like a car accident  and he's gonna come  searching you out  he lost his leg  at the hip  and they just took  his ACL out  and gave it to  he fell asleep  in a hotel room  with a chick  woke up  I've taken your ACL  get to the hospital  he's gonna limp along  trying to chase you down 
[01:15:30]  if you want it back  go to Jones Beach  this Saturday  instead of like  50,000 they get  for a liver  you only get like  10 bucks for an ACL  10 bucks  on the black market  you took my leg  for 10 bucks  oh I gave you 10 bucks  so do you feel like  jumping or anything  yeah I can actually  dunk now  alright  is that it  yeah I'm pretty sure  he's from the upper east side  way upper  yeah  yeah I slam dunked  on this leg  do you ever think like  and my chicks love me  for 40 years  that thing was just  in somebody else 
[01:16:00]  it learned to ride a bike  I don't understand  and it kind of  it hung out  like it was in a little pool  it helped kick a soccer ball  with your head  yeah  yeah  you creep  and then it went out  it had sex for the first time  and it was being used  you know  and then there it is now  it's in Bob Kelly  my knee's been in doggy position  yeah it could have  it was flung back  by his face  while he looked at  another gentleman  Jimmy's always got  I was going to come up 
[01:16:30]  with a cute little  his legs are swinging  off a dock  as he's fishing  and Jimmy has to go  right for the knockout  I'm trying to paint  the Norman Rockwell scene  that's what I was  trying to do too man  I like yours  I like the little  swinging off the dock  a little bobber  in the water  going up and down  just a happy life  being had by all  Jim takes it right  to the edge of the cliff  and he kicks it off  fast forward  a few years  the doctor has it  in his mouth  because his hands  are busy  yeah he's cutting away 
[01:17:00]  and doing whatever  he has to do  with his two hands  so he figured  I'll keep the ligament  in my mouth  until I have to  it's not that far  fetched  before those surgery  shows on TV  didn't you always think  that surgery  was this very  precise  very delicate procedure  like scalpel  and very gently  cuts  and then uses  this instrument  they are pulling  tugging  chiseling  they have like  power tools  that the only 
[01:17:30]  difference between  me using them  on a job site  and these guys  is that it's been  sterilized  and it's covered  in some kind of  plastic  but they're drilling  holes with  Makita drills  banging away  with like a  claw hammer  I have a screw  in my leg  and half of the  pain after surgery  is him going in  and just ripping  my muscles  off of bone  and digging away  like hold this  put this there  they did  get that out of my way  the worst was  like I saw them  using a chisel  on someone's hip bone  like they were  putting in an 
[01:18:00]  artificial hip  and because the  socket was so  worn away  they have to  chisel pieces  of that away  to get like  the burrs off of it  so the new  little Teflon piece  they put in there  sits right  and there they are  wham wham wham  with a hammer  and then they buff  it out with a thing  it's like they're  working on cars  yeah you put a  screw in my knee  I have a screw  and you would think  it would be like  this slow meticulous  turning of the screw  there with a ratchet  going 
[01:18:30]  like a spark plug  the scariest part  is that you're in there  you know  and you're talking  to everybody  and everything  yeah alright  and then you just  wake up  you just wake up  two and a half hours  later  and it's done  you just wake up  and someone's  feeding you crackers  it don't feel like  two and a half hours  you're literally going  yeah man  I'm just  and you wake up  I need water  that's what it feels like  you're falling asleep  next thing you know  you're waking up 
[01:19:00]  you don't even feel  falling asleep now  it's like  they don't even have  you count to ten  or anything  it's like  so I  and you're out  and you wake up  Mr. Kelly  you can't even talk  you can't  your knees  just wrapped  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  does it hurt  when you wake up  oh it's awful  you just wake up  and you slowly  you're struggling  to gain consciousness  which is the worst  feeling ever  it's like  you take this  I'm kind of awake 
[01:19:30]  but nothing's working  it's almost like  you're ripping  your head off the pillow  but it's stuck  and you're like  and then you just  snap back onto the pillow  and you go back out  and then you wake up  and you go back  and my girl was there  and you know  I love her to death  but you're getting  aggravated at her  because she's like  you're gonna be alright  I know  shut up  I'm just trying to wake up  we have audio  from your doctor  after the surgery  when you're in recovery  you can act like a man  what's the matter with you  they smacked you  did you feel sick 
[01:20:00]  when you woke up  from the  yeah you feel sick  it depends on if you  the anesthesia guy  I went in and talked  to him  this time  the last time  I did the knee surgery  I don't know  I think they gave me pot  just let you smoke a joint  there you go man  this is all you need  it's good stuff  I just woke up in pain  I was just like  did you guys do anything  for my pain  did you at least go  to a doctor's office  for the first surgery  or was it  in someone's apartment  actually the operation  yeah right where  I got the colonics 
[01:20:30]  this is what's weird  it was in a woman's  breast cancer hospital  in New Rochelle  what  yeah  and that's where  you had your leg done  my first knee surgery  you had knee  this one I had  at Lenox Hill  you had knee surgery  at a woman's  breast cancer hospital  yeah  that's when I knew  something was wrong  you got a guy  that was like  moonlighting  yeah  I didn't know this  but like doctors  have to fight  for OR time  you have to like  you know  and you have to fight 
[01:21:00]  for like your staff  like people like  I need him  give me him  you can't use him  that OR has booked  and there's some lady  going  it's like dodgeball  yeah there's some lady  that coordinates  the whole thing  like you can have  this room  and at 2.15  and you need a staff  if you don't have a staff  and it's no  you know  all this stuff's going on  but this hospital  in New Rochelle  it was just  you know  I showed up  it was a bunch  of sick chicks  oh man  me with a  you know  limping in  so wait  you had to come  all the way back  from New Rochelle  that day  it was  I was in a Honda Civic 
[01:21:30]  at least you had  a roomy car  hearing my  girl go  sorry  sorry  I'm sorry  baby I'm so sorry  I get it  just get me home  yeah it was awful  and the anesthesia guy  didn't really  he did  he just  I think he just  knocked me out  like punched me  in the jaw  I really think  he was like  hey you  whack  and he just  knocked me out  you had like  Civil War surgery  for sure  yeah  the doctor actually  stayed in the  Holiday Inn Express  the night before  he wasn't really a doctor 
[01:22:00]  are you kidding  who knows though  at this point  I could see him  hacksawing your leg  that was awful  this new guy though  this Dr. Lee  was fantastic  he's amazing  but you got  dead guy in you now  I get  dead guy  he's a dead guy  a little creepy  I wish she was a 20 year old  not as creepy as  dead guy corneas  what  yeah you can get  dead guy corneas  yeah there's all kinds  of body parts  so now you're looking  through someone else's 
[01:22:30]  corneas  that's creepy  you can get a dead  guy's eye  or cornea  I think it's the cornea  right  yeah  that's creepy  because now you're like  somebody else was seeing  through this thing  before me  that's creepy  that's creepy  don't you hope  that your body parts  go to like  nothing against you Bob  you're a great  guy  great comic  but I don't think  most people think  I hope a comedian  gets this  I'm imagining 
[01:23:00]  this guy  hoping  that some NBA rookie  that went down  or maybe a little kid  and this is his chance  to maybe make a huge  comeback in the NBA  not Bob  not even something  like that  sports related  it could just be  you know  a scientist  that's working  on something  very important  it's just some guy  telling friggin dirty jokes  it goes to a guy  that's going to  limp out  onto the stage  Jones Beach Saturday  I really am  though  I actually  looked at my schedule 
[01:23:30]  the first O&A show  and I was like  I gotta  I go  can I make this show  and he was like  I don't know  I was like  I need to make this show  he's like  I'm pretty sure you will  oh you're gonna get  an ovation  you are gonna get  an ovation  when you limp out  with your dead guy knee  and your road warrior brace  oh there was no way  I started doing  physical therapy  like the week  the week after  I started like  lifting my leg up  it would shake  and then I'd put it down  I felt like  like a fat Rocky  trying to make  an O&A show  I'm gonna make it  for the fans 
[01:24:00]  you can do it  rock  instead of throwing  oranges  they throw me  ice cream cones  and like salmon  you're just practicing  like getting on a stage  with Rocky music  playing in your  dumb apartment  jeez  what is wrong  with you  booger eating dogs  around you  they weren't  rooting you on  are you psyched  for the show though  Bob  how much fun  did we have  last year  we're gonna try  to tape a lot more  stuff behind the scenes  because that's  the stuff that was  going on backstage 
[01:24:30]  was amazing  we need multi-camera  shoots  yeah  yeah it was  ridiculous  these shows  you try to explain  it to people too  because everybody's  what are these  virus shows like  you can't even  explain it  because it's like  it's like you're  rock and roll man  it's like being at a  concert except  it's comedy  you know  and it's all  headliners too  it's like  which is crazy  yeah  it's not like  this one's opening  it's like you don't  even give anybody  a break on the show  you don't even put  like one  kind of okay guy  you put like  nine headliners  just slamming guys 
[01:25:00]  that go out there  and rip it  so everybody's like  oh god  Patrice is on you  like no  I gotta follow that  oh yeah  but you guys do it  to each other  it's hilarious  yeah there's not  one guy that's  you know  gonna go out there  even Vosk  he's like  even Vosk  but he goes out  and kills  even Vosk  even Vosk  never sounds good  you know what's  ruthless  watching all the  comics backstage  watching the guy  on stage  on the TV monitor  right  and the guy  that's going up next  is just looking  going good  good he didn't get 
[01:25:30]  a laugh on that one  alright good  like hoping they bomb  well you don't want  you really don't want  anybody to bomb  you really want them  to do good  because if they  the crowd  like I was trying  to explain to somebody  the crowds  know comedy  your crowds  they're not there  to get crap face  and just see you guys  they're there to see  a comedy show  and so they're  actually listening  which kind of  weirds you out  as you're out there  because you think  you're going to go  out there and go  but you tell a joke  they laugh  and then they're  looking at you  like waiting for  the next joke  you're like what  that's what I was 
[01:26:00]  impressed with last  year because we  had no idea  how this was going  to work  especially with  our audience  that's probably  I shouldn't even  say that  well they're known  to be animals  thank you Jimmy  yeah and  they are great  crowds for this tour  they know comedy  man  we thought  we had no idea  we thought it  could be a disaster  because they know  Jimmy and they go  to Jimmy's shows  for all these years  and they know  how comedy works  you know what I mean  they know  to let the show  go on and they do  their crazy stuff  after or whatever  but Jimmy though  he's got the hardest  one he's got to 
[01:26:30]  go up at the end  after everybody  I don't always  go on at the end  sometimes we  like Rogan  went on last  in Vegas  I like sometimes  a guy they haven't  seen in a long time  but I like to  they always don't  learn from my show  is that like  when I turn around  and I face away  from them  that a funny  impression is  turning around  oh well of course  because you turned  around  why else would you  do that  unless you were  going to spin  back around  with a great  impression  here's Johnny  Colin Quinn  when he does  an impression  he just steps 
[01:27:00]  to the left  and does the  same raspy voice  we got a pair  of tickets  and we'll throw  in a meet  and greet  pass for the  Traveling Fire  show this  Saturday  at Jones Beach  what's the  meet and greet  we have to  meet them  we're meeting  greeting  you make it  sound really  some listeners  hey welcome  I won't meet  and greet  anybody  I'll meet  I'm not going  to greet  I'll greet  but no meeting  I'm just going  to stand there  if you're free

[01:28:00]  not really  you got some  nice extras  like Opie's face  he won't tell you  but he has something  I'm being the wowed  on pal talk  over here  what  it is whip them out  Wednesday  it is whip them out  Wednesday  it's whip them out  Wednesday  you get a wow  on your vehicle  in some way  shape or form  whether it's  a bumper sticker  sanctioned by us  or just you know  you're right wow  on the back  of your truck  in dirt  you drive around  a girl sees the wow  she knows what it means  she'll flash you  on your way home  on your nasty commute home  no matter where you are  in the country  wow does work  it's like fishing  you put your line  in the water  you just gotta wait  a little while  be patient 
[01:28:30]  and there it is  a girl will flash you  and then when it's done  you both go about  your business  on your separate ways  you take it with you  in your memory  and go  thank you for making  my commute special  fine lady  and I'm being wowed  right now  this is the lovely  Bree  is on the camera  Vicky too  has just  they're giant  wait where's Vicky  I don't  Eric open more girls  oh my god  where's Vicky  come on  they're giant  my god  where's Vicky  more girls Eric  hey what is that one 
[01:29:00]  Iraq  I don't get the one  what's the one  with the girl  just sitting there  topless  where's that  wow  she's got  wow  we got all sorts  of shapes  let me get that  why wouldn't you  get pal talk  at this point  wow  how do you hate  pal talk talk  anyone ain't talking  about pal talk  how do you hate  when we talk  about chicks  wow  is alive and well  on pal talk  that's for sure  wow  she's just kind of  strutting around  in a little  little 
[01:29:30]  thong  and  hey  are we going to  spray paint  the girls  in the ONA village  yes  that suggestion  just came in  thank you  to whoever  that was  that came up  with that  suggestion  yeah we're going  to be spray painting  girls so they can  walk around  like the 7 train  or  well you know  you ever see  the  we want scratch  heady done  to the girls  like the windows  you're going to  tag them  you're going to  put  MS13 gang signs 
[01:30:00]  on their asses  yo  east side  no you ever see  the body painting  where  the girls nude  her top  is completely  new  but you can't  barely see it  because the air  brushing is done  so well  so they're going  to do that  and so we could  have chicks  just walking  around topless  you shouldn't  have a professional  do it  you should just  have one of the  ONA pests  do it  just a pest  with a roller  just a crappy  drawing  it's like an old  roller and latex  paint  it's just like a  crappy palm tree  with a bird 
[01:30:30]  we gotta  just an ONA pest  who's drunk  just airbrushing  dumb little  cartoons  on their breasts  we gotta  sex up  the ONA village  you ever watch  them spray paint  a car like in  Detroit  like when they're  on the auto line  you just put  cotton in her  mouth and eyes  last they just  missed her  spin her around  alright hopefully  we'll be having  girls walk around  topless  get to work on that  spray paint on them 
[01:31:00]  so it looks like  they're not topless  so that's a law  if you cover it up  with like a  centimeter of paint  you can walk around  yeah something like  that you know  I wouldn't mind  with a millimeter  myself for sure  a centimeter  Jesus you're  talking a lot of  paint  that's like an  old house  Bob  a centimeter  yeah  it's like 18  layers and the  bottom ones are  lead  I had to paint  houses once  summer man  you don't want  a centimeter  of paint  that's a pain  in the ass  to get off  a centimeter  a centimeter  my god  he said 
[01:31:30]  I would've went  with a millimeter  myself  god damn  bobby  I just don't know  your metric system  no I really don't  alright so yeah  it's a meter of paint  we're giving away  the tickets for  Jones Beach  when we get back  we'll do the  Paris Illinois  yes  I guess we got  a phone call  from Paris  that she made  from the joint  not to us  no  no it's like  one of those  we caught her  making a call  and someone  recorded it  yeah  so it's kind  of hard to hear 
[01:32:00]  that was actually  crap all the time  they had a lot  of princess diet  and Charles audio  like that  where they do  something  like if one person  is on a cell phone  I don't know  how they do it  I used to get it  with a scanner  cell phone calls  it's great  that was one of the  things she was  worried about too  is having photos  taken over by the  guards  and being recorded  you know  saying certain things  you know  that was one of the  things she was  paranoid about  so that's weird  that you actually  got it this soon  I made out  with her once  no you didn't  no you didn't 
[01:32:30]  where  how long did it  take you  to go from  no you didn't  to where  I know really  oh Jimmy  look at me  you're the worst  Jimmy you have charm  but you were so confident  you're like  no you didn't  and all Jimmy did  was say  yeah he does  where  where wow  dude my buddy  made out with a dude  they told it  dude  like there's about  information's about  to come  like  where  lonely idiot

[01:42:30]  they kept slamming it down  what'd you say  I got a massage one time  it was so awful  she was legit  and I was getting a massage  and every time she would  touch the back of my thigh  I would go  and push my ass  oh no  just relax  just relax  in other words  knock that off  stop moving your hips  idiot  I feel sorry  for the people  that go to school for this  because they really want  to just do legit  yeah  massage  and you gotta have Jimmy go  and Bobby as he's getting 
[01:43:00]  massaged looking like a cat  when you pet its back  from head to tail  Bobby's going  wow  wow  Bob's in heat  I rolled over  on a massage  on a legit one  at a hotel  and it looked  you know  maternly  just you know  yeah  like yeah  she looked like  that's just the word  that gets conjured up  when he said that  this matronly woman  yeah like somebody  in one of your video games  at the barless  from the Brady Bunch  48 means  she was like 55  by the way  a matronly woman  no no no no  I went with 
[01:43:30]  the oldest massage  person I went with  was probably around  68  70  that was that lady  I told you about  up in LA  it was mature lady  I was trying to find  a mature lady  but when I  her ad was very misleading  when I got to her house  she had cotton candy hair  her negligee didn't fit  it was hanging off her body  and she had arthritic knuckles  and when we went upstairs  to get the massage  she couldn't even really  hold my hand correctly 
[01:44:00]  oh man  she was trying to hold my hand  but her knuckles  couldn't bend all the way  so she was just like  arthritis  it was almost like a talon  just like pinching  onto my pinky  did you have corn chip  finger and toenails  yeah  I have to fit that in  every day  little toenails  that look like  Doritos  wait so your thing  is to look for  mature masseuses  I like mature  yeah because you get  more out of your buck  I mean  what  you get more out of your buck  how  they might have a stroke  while they're doing it  no because you get some 
[01:44:30]  you get some hot chick  she's just trying to  flip you over  and get you the hell  out of there  you get a mature lady  you come in  you know  she's like  this one lady  you come in  she gave you  you start out  in a robe  and she has tea  and she asks you  what your problems  are this week  it's like a visit  with grandma  what the hell  do you want  with that  she'll give you  a ginger snap  juice  send you on your way  I have ribbon candy  would you like 
[01:45:00]  ribbon candy  wonderful  it's been lovely  talking to you  she asked you  like you know  what your problems  were this week  and you tell her  whatever stressed you  out and she'd get  you tea  for that problem  and then she'd  she'd give  she had these stones  nice one  Bobby  you took me  out of the  book  you took me  out  the kidney stone  sorry 
[01:45:30]  yeah so she'd  sit you down  you'd talk about  whatever your  problems were  she'd give you  a stone  and she'd tell  you what it  meant  and then she'd  tell you  I would throw  them at her  just start  wailing them  into her head  and then you'd  drink your tea  and then she'd  bring you into  the room  and she'd put  a little thing  on  it's tantric  massage right  no no this  is just a  regular massage  and she'd give  you an hour  and a half  massage  and if you  know if  anybody's on  Craigslist  trying to get  a massage  that's pretty  good  an hour and a  I mean a 
[01:46:00]  great massage  you get the  ocean sounds  in the back  room a little  CD she's got  on  candles  and she's just  rubbing you down  and then at  around like an  hour and 20  she starts getting  a little frisky  an hour and  20  oh no  a 68 year old  broad  no she wasn't  68  that lady  couldn't rub  my back  she had to  like use her  elbow  she had like  85 cats  just staring at  me like I was  a loser  this woman 
[01:46:30]  so this woman  starts getting  frisky  the 48 year old  yeah she starts  getting frisky  a little bit  just a little  and then she  put this  she got this  jar of  I don't know  it looked like  hair gel  and she put it  in the microwave  and it was this  oil  and then  it was just  it was just  all over  and then she  did what she  did and it  was unbelievable  and then she  takes you  into the  bathroom  and washes  you  like a  like a  god  and did she  hold your  face in front  of a mirror  so you have  to look at  the fact  that a  50 year old  just put 
[01:47:00]  tapioca  all over you  she was  female  Jimmy  I don't  know  that doesn't  sound very  sexy  at all  that's a  visit with  grandma  except for  the part  where  and with  certain  people  maybe it  is still  a visit  with grandma  but that  just seems  like you know  there's too  much with  the tea  party going  on  back to  the tea  after she  washes  you get  back in  your robe  you have 
[01:47:30]  your tea  again  you have  some tea  again  and then  she gives  you the  stone  and you  talk more  about the  stone  you don't  want to  sit with  a hot chick  after you're  done  what are you  going to  sit with  grandma  why do you  sit with  grandma  after that  let's  snuggle  I was a little  uncomfortable  after I  gotta admit  you have to  get out of  there  you have a  green rock  that you're  rubbing  enough about  the stones  grandma  that's her  way of not  feeling completely  dirty about  what she just  did  there's more  to it than  just that  125  that's all  it costs 
[01:48:00]  you should  have used  a rock  to break  the window  to get  the hell  out  and then  throw the  teeter face  so long  I overspot  by a hundred  guarantee you  Jimmy asked  me for the  number  I guarantee  it  I've been  on a  legitimate  massage tear  like in my  back I hit  the heavy  bag  and it's  hard to  find  what did  you just  say  I hit  the heavy  bag  so it's  really hard  to find  I love  watching Jimmy  hit the  heavy bag  because he  hit it  like he's  defending  himself  from rape  he just 
[01:48:30]  it's just  one person  I smash  it  I yell  measure  what are  you doing  he just  he puts  his head  down and  just punches  like rock  them sock  them robots  as as  Bob is  telling this  unsexy  grandma  stone  tea  finish off  job  a story  Jimmy has  his hand  down his  pants  not  am I  being creepy  I just  sit like  this sometimes  yeah  let's just  say the  kid had  a good  one last  night  oh  yeah  a good  session  and what  you're  kind of 
[01:49:00]  running  it  through  your  head  no  no  I'm not  I'm not  I'm a little  turnable  I'm not  it's about  I'm a little  sore actually  from  oh  oh  so  what does  that do  for you  I don't know  I'm just  feeling like  it's like  a little sore  nothing big  you're a  comfortable guy  you could just  sit there  I'm not  talking like  the  Al Bundy  just up to  the knuckles  hand  down the front  of his pants  it is pretty  much between  his wrist  and elbow 
[01:49:30]  his pant  line  I saw  my girl  last night  and she  had been  away  and we  had a  lovely  encounter  oh  goody  yeah  let's see  right hand  okay I was  going to say  could I shake  hands with  Jimmy today  or no  it ended in us  like both  saying like  you know I  didn't mean  that right  like you know  the thing  oh  okay  she got a  little offended  at one point  she's like  the Lakers  yeah no  there's a woman  there's a place  I'm not going to  even say the club  because I don't  people know  where we go  down by where  we you know  Esty's joint 
[01:50:00]  and there's a  there's a  massage place  the Asian place  it's completely  legitimate  yep  and there is a  woman in there  named Lulu  who destroys  my back  there's never  been a better  massage  from anyone  than this woman  yeah she's the  greatest  and she doesn't  speak great English  but like she gets  in there and she's  like she's like  is that too  harder  and I'm like  no it's okay  and she goes  thank you  it's very cute  the way she goes  thank you  oh really  she's like  she's complimenting  when you go  no it's good  she's amazing  yeah but it's  completely  straightforward  but they're not  trained but she 
[01:50:30]  just she's more  intuitive with your  back than anybody  I've ever been to  I hate when they  use their elbows  it's just cheating  yeah but it's  just uncomfortable  that place  because it's  it's not a room  it's like a one  bedroom or a studio  apartment that they  just put curtains up  so there's you can  literally hear the  guy next to you  going  it's like guys  on either side  of you  there's not even  Bob  you know  I was still  my girlfriend was  waiting for a massage  and then there was  she was sitting in the 
[01:51:00]  thing waiting  and then there's  like you said  there's all curtains  in between you  so there's one guy  getting a massage  and then there's me  and there's a guy  like you know what I  mean it's like chair  waiting room  massage curtains  me  so there's a guy  actually between me  and my girlfriend  but no one could  see each other  and he's making  trying to be funny  with the lady  and no it's just  awful  oh no he's bombing  but I'm laughing  like Uncle Paul  like there's something  creepy about laughing  at someone else's  like he's trying  to be funny  and I'm like  and she's 
[01:51:30]  I hear her laughing  hey before we take  a break  we should play  this Paris Hilton  thing we've been  talking about  oh yeah yeah yeah  I think we got a  pretty good copy  at this point  I think this copy  stinks by the way  but that's my opinion  an intercepted phone  call to Paris Hilton  I guess  can I turn my  headphones off  because I can't  really hear it  it hasn't been  playing yet stupid  no I couldn't  hear it before  dummy  Jesus we settled  down Jimmy 
[01:52:00]  when is Paris  getting out  I don't know  I don't know  20 something days  this call better  be interesting  because I don't  care about her  I could give a  crap  enough about the  news  mommy didn't have  to wait to see  her  no  everybody else  was like lined  up  she was whisked  right in  unbelievable  she was pissing  off so many  people  alright so  let's take a  listen to this  Paris Hilton  on a cell phone  what I saw

[01:59:00]  Steve just walked  right in the middle  that lucky you  I don't know  boy Steve's got  weird timing  doesn't he  anytime a man's ass  is exposed  did you notice  Steve's  eyebrows  it's the most  disturbing thing  I've ever seen  as the days go by  Steve you still gotta  cover it up  with the hat  we gotta make him  wear a pirate patch  on his eye  until his brow  grows back  I heard him  explaining it to Bob  and I'm just not  buying any of the  explanations  I never buy any  of my explanations 
[01:59:30]  because why would  you shave the second  one to make it look  just as creepy  as the first one  you would have  looked better  with one eyebrow  I absolutely  would not have  I gotta have  some kind of symmetry  no it isn't  no you don't  it's not a mustache  it's an eyebrow  if you shave  one eyebrow  and you have the  other one  and you go  what happened  I messed up  a little  people go  okay cool  I think Steve  was going for  a new look  and you realize  wow this really sucks  I gotta come up  with an excuse  because the guy  is gonna notice  gay alien  because he said 
[02:00:00]  that he's done  it a million times  I have  shaved the eyebrows  I've taken a beard  trimmer to my eyebrows  before and no one's  ever noticed  because I've adjusted  the height  on the little gauge  there so it  didn't black off  all of them  get your face  on pal talk  no one believes  your excuses  lift up your hat  so they can see  how creepy it is  on pal talk  I know nobody believes  I wasn't doing anything  he was sitting there  and I tripped  and my face  hit his belt buckle  that was when  you walked in  yes exactly like that  so he said  that he's done 
[02:00:30]  this a million times  but for some reason  the adjustment  was different  he shaved off  the one eyebrow  and figured  I might as well  shave off  the other one  that's not what  you did  you were playing  games with one  of your guy friends  truth or dare  he was like  I'd like to do this  I don't know  I'll try it  and then he was like  you want to do  the other one  and then halfway  through  and then halfway  through the other eyebrow  you guys just went at it  and started making out heavy  so you had to  wow  you got this all  plotted out in your head  don't you  the treatment  I just sold it to NBC 
[02:01:00]  what'd you just do  I'm roid  that's a sign of colon cancer  it can be if it's like  an itch inside  internal for a while  how far inside  I don't know  but I think it's  you need someone  to scratch it  I think it's  I got the little  I had the first time  I ever had to use  preparation H  oh you used it  you finally crossed  that threshold  into adulthood  I've never had to  I didn't either  I've never used  preparation H  I've never used it  I'm not saying  I've never had  you know  a little action  going on  under your eyes 
[02:01:30]  right  back there  as far as the roid goes  but  yeah yeah I know  but  you just  man up  you man up  and just use  like a baby wipe  it's an applicator  how do you apply  that stuff  and what does it do  to you  it's almost like  the applicator  picture a tube of  toothpaste  with a pointy top  it doesn't hurt though  why is Steve nodding  like big time  oh Steve knows  about this  I did a lot of  pushing  when I was eating  only red meat  picture  you know it looks  like the tin man's hat  okay the tin man's hat 
[02:02:00]  very good  picture the tin man's hat  yeah  if it had a bunch  of holes in it  so if it was on the  edge of a tube of  toothpaste  you squeeze the tube  and then threw  the little holes  in the hat  like a play-doh  fun factory  yes  so you would say  you would say  like say it was  for your ear  you would insert  the applicator  into your ear  right  and then squeeze it  and all of the  goodness goes  and comes out  and then you remove  the applicator  how far in your ear  does the applicator go  I got a mallet  and really taught  myself a lesson  I would say 
[02:02:30]  I wasn't  I wasn't taking  any chances  no  just a little bit  not enough to get  me to yell  he actually tasted  it when he was done  ugh  yeah  but no  I uh  I never have  problems like that  never  no  never  it's really  bumming me out  though  that's a drag  Bob what do you  think's going on  there  I've had him  I've had him  I've done the  same thing  the little applicator  but a little itch  is normal right  yeah a little itch  I mean you don't  want to get  addicted to it  like you know  you're channel surfing 
[02:03:00]  and itching your bum  you don't want to  you know that can  happen where it's  just a thing you do  yeah  ew  you guys  get addicted  to that stuff  you guys come from  another planet  you get addicted  you just  you know  you leave  you kind of  almost like it  it's like you sit  there you itch  your bum  you smell your  thing  and then you  change the channel  I want to know  if he thinks that  by gur  nobody knew what  he meant  he took off the  gur  the gur  yeah  I just mix it up  a little bit  I always wondered  how it was applied  because I assumed  unless you've used it 
[02:03:30]  you don't know  I assumed you had  to put a little  dollop on your  finger  and then kind of  apply like that  and I was thinking  if I ever had to  use that  I would just take  a big swatch  of toilet paper  really  just goop it all  in there  and then just kind of  apply it that way  you wouldn't use  your finger  no  I do not  touch  that  oh my god  I do not  touch  that  ever  I don't  I don't 
[02:04:00]  touch that  ever  ever  what are you talking about  I don't touch  why would you  there is  there is no reason  to touch it  he does  I am right now  first of all  that's some bathroom issues  Jimmy  don't  right now  because let me tell you  something  look to your left  look to your right  don't  why are you touching it  stop it  look what they do  look what they do  get away from me  I'm not talking about  hold on  can I direct this  alright  now Bobby and Jimmy  touch fingers  no  oh god  no we'll actually 
[02:04:30]  create a ghost  no Jimmy  oh my god  someone was on the  exercise bike yesterday  stop  both of you  just stop  you guys are disgusting  there is no reason  to touch that  you understand  over a million people  are listening to this  where you guys  just stop  there is a  there is  there is a certain  area  that you can scratch  where you can go  down from your  lower back  but then you must  stop  at a certain  spot  and you go  no further  there is no  touching that 
[02:05:00]  there is only  the only things  that may touch  that is  toilet paper  yeah  and  and like  a baby wipe  thing  they're not  baby wipes  anymore  they're just  like adults  you know  Cottonelle puts  them out  and stuff  really  don't forget  a ring finger  no  there is no  reason  why are you  depriving yourself  because  because it has  a half life  of like  it's like  radiation  no no  you can't  wash your  hands  and get  rid of it  you will now  be stuck  with that  like a 
[02:05:30]  smoker's  finger  oh  my god  even Bob Kelly  is freaked out  Jimmy  Bobby is freaked  out  you can just  you know what  just leave it to  the listener's  imagination  I think the  reaction says it  all  all right  well yeah  well  wow  Bob Kelly  finally freaked  out  dude that is  the dirtiest  lollipop I've  ever seen  in my life  not KFC  you were  what the hell 
[02:06:00]  is wrong  with you  it's a matter  with you  it's perfectly  fine  you  it was  you  we're gonna  need a whole  pack of  Orbit gum  for that one  no you won't  let me explain  something to you  I'll explain  this right  okay  I as a person  from head to toe  I'm very hygienic  hygienic doesn't  matter  hold on  now  okay  if I'm with a  young lady  I happen to  like my ear licked  I think when  the girl kisses me  on the ear  and hits my ear  it's very sexy 
[02:06:30]  I've heard about  that fetish you have  about having your  ear licked  so why wouldn't I  if I scratch the  inside of my ear  who am I  to ask a girl  to lick my ear  and then after I  scratch it all  I'm gonna put my  finger in my mouth  right in the mouth  that goes  why not  my ears are clean  there's no reason  to  there's no reason  not to  it's wonderful  there is no  reason  I like to  lick armpits  yeah that's  kind of sexy  I like that too  yeah lick a  lick a armpit  girls love it too 
[02:07:00]  they always say  no at first  and then you do it  and they flip out  I tell my girlfriend  I don't wear deodorant  I'm like don't wear deodorant  she's like what  she doesn't really  stink though  it bugs me  I'm like did you  work up a sweat  there  see there's  situations  you're gonna  build me a stairwell  you're gonna go  hook her up  with your super  and go do some  trash with him  for a little while  come back upstairs  when you're done  I just know  that there have  been occasions  hasn't happened  to me in years  since I was a kid 
[02:07:30]  but you would  you would  crumble up a bunch  of a nice  cotton ale or  something  or a Scott  tissue  and go to  take care  and clean up  and somehow  it shifts  to the side  and in a moment  of terror  you realize  your hand  has come  uncovered  a piece of it  and now you're like  and then you're  just sitting there  and you go  oh god  please don't  have let me  hit ground zero  and you go  oh my god 
[02:08:00]  it made contact  his fingers  like Richard Dreyfuss  in Jaws  when the cage  fell out  and then  and then  the washing  and washing  and washing  and then  you go  and it's like  okay  just all I'm  smelling is soap  and then 15  minutes later  you go to  eat your Twinkie  and you bring  your hand up  to your mouth  and go  oh god  it's still there  that is  a dedicated  aroma  I wouldn't even  wash my hands  dude  I would pick up 
[02:08:30]  some  I'd pick up  Wonder Bread White  and eat a sandwich  right there  would mean  nothing to me  peanut butter  is this  exactly  I'd grab the peanut  butter out of the fridge  and I'd scoop out  a dollop full  and then put it  back in the fridge  this is a disgusting  conversation  it wasn't peanuts  when it came out  Norton man  oh man  you guys are  not right 
[02:09:00]  there's a Norton level  there's nothing  on my body  I'm uncomfortable  with like that  it's nothing  no  no reason  I think God's uncomfortable  it doesn't bother me  it's like it's not  because I'm not dirty  what do you mean  it's dirty though  I'm not  don't imply  I'm dirty  you said it doesn't  bother you  because I'm not dirty  implying that if it  bothers somebody  that they must in fact  be dirty  is that what you're  saying Jimmy  that's what Jimmy's  saying  no I'm not  I would say that  if I was  but I'm saying  that's how he gets  out of things  I would say that  if you want 
[02:09:30]  you're filthy hairy  Italian  that's how Jimmy  does it  the fact that  you're a  greasy northern  Sicilian  it doesn't bother  me at all  because I look  like a sweaty  baby's forehead  yeah no  I don't think  it's dirty  but whatever  bothers him  about it  is his thing  but I'm telling  you why  it's okay  why I'm okay  with it  I wouldn't do  it to you  but to me  I'll do it  there are some  things you could  clean up  let me say  if there's a  sewage treatment  plant  you could scrub  the outside 
[02:10:00]  of a sewage  treatment plant  until it is  squeaky clean  and you could  see a reflection  in the bins  but it's still  a sewage  treatment plant  it doesn't matter  how clean it is  where does this  come from  it comes from  the basic  human fact  I'm not thrilled  with the bathroom  stuff in general  but you take it  to a freakish  level  it's not a  freakish level  it is a basic  human level  that you don't  deal with  that area  that is 
[02:10:30]  that is all  about exhaust  when you wash  your car  do you wash  the inside  of the exhaust  pipe  no  because you know  there's just  going to be  carbon coming  out of it  the next time  you start it up  there's other  things you do  we were fortunate  enough to go  into the bathroom  with Anthony  one time  and he flushes  as he goes  it's a courtesy  flush  for yourself  well no  because there  were other  people in there  who cares  I love basking  in my own  fumes  I don't care  I don't care  if it smells  like an oil  refinery  I'm not buying  that  I do the 
[02:11:00]  courtesy flush  I think he's  like  it's a shame  issue  I've also  flushed  to math  smelly  smelly  ant  that's what  happened  when he was  a little boy  that's what I'm getting at  his little  kindergarten bathroom  and the girl  he liked  walked in after him  and went  do it he's  cool me  do it he's  cool me  and pointed at him  and it scarred him  for life  first of all  I would never  go in school  I would never  do that  of course  you wouldn't  I forgot  uncle so and so  came in  wrecked that part 
[02:11:30]  of your psyche  six years earlier  why would you  on that  and sometimes  I flush  to mask  sounds  I will do that  because I am  so disgusted  when I walk  into a public  bathroom  and hear  what amounts  to a  it sounds like  an orchestra  tuning  in the stall  next to me  when you get  off the plane  I do not  want to hear  that  there's just  and the guy's  like  in between  the disgusting  sounds  you're just  hearing  you don't 
[02:12:00]  want to hear  no one  enjoys that  but there's  something about  that  you take it  to the next  level  it's like  nails on a  chalkboard  to you  and then you  just hear  someone making  sausages  in a pool  I don't  want to be  part of that  I don't  want to make  that experience  for somebody  else  so right
