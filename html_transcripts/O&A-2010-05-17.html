<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie detailing the intense challenges of new fatherhood.  He vividly describes the stark contrast between the peaceful daytime with his newborn and the nightmarish sleep deprivation fueled by constant paranoia about the baby's breathing.  He and Jimmy, both exhausted (Jimmy from relationship troubles), commiserate about their lack of sleep. A caller, Sean from Pittsburgh, shares similar anxieties about accidentally harming his infant. Opie recounts his wife's labor, including the late induction (criticizing the doctor's weekend priorities), the water breaking, the use of an amniotic hook, the epidural, and graphic details of the birthing process, including the pushing stage and cutting the umbilical cord.  He describes the post-partum period, breastfeeding, the help of a lactating consultant, and various baby excrement stages. He shares a humorous anecdote about a nail salon visit with his wife and discusses the unexpected timing of his son's birth on Mother's Day, his relationship with his mother, and his experiences with his child's excretions.  The segment ends with a discussion of Apple products, a funny DJ video, and a surprise call from Louis C.K. offering fatherly advice.

The show then transitions to a discussion of Ronnie James Dio's death from stomach cancer.  Opie and Anthony share anecdotes about Dio's past appearances on the show and play a clip of a past interview. They discuss Dio's influence on metal music and express regret over missed opportunities to connect with him.  The conversation shifts to Godsmack's new album, *Oracle*, and includes anecdotes about Sully Erna and listener calls detailing the alleged subjects of songs like "Crying Like a Bitch" (Nikki Sixx) and "Aneurism" (Bret Michaels). The hosts critique Chickenfoot's music. The segment concludes with a discussion of various sports teams – the Flyers, Canadiens, Yankees, Mets, and the potential LeBron James move – interspersed with personal anecdotes and a caller's *Seinfeld*-esque parking story, along with a rumor about LeBron's poor performance possibly being related to his mother's affair with a teammate.

The next segment focuses on LeBron James' free agency, discussing potential destinations (Bulls, Clippers, Nets, Knicks, Heat), and a humorous song about Cleveland.  However, the majority of this segment centers on a deeply offensive and sexually explicit discussion of intern Sean's girlfriend, their orchestrated date with another man ("Troy"), and the hosts' crude commentary on the date's details.  This includes playing and mocking a Sammy Hagar song. A call from former intern Cream Pie Jones ensues, expressing concern about how a past "duty hat" segment (involving feces) has negatively impacted his job prospects.  Audio of the "duty hat" segment is played, and the discussion continues on Sean's perceived emo tendencies and his reaction to the date.

The following segment is a retrospective on past interns, ranking them from "stupidest" to less stupid.  Opie and Anthony, along with Sam and others, recount various anecdotes, playing a music video by Cream Pie Jones ("Julia"), which is heavily criticized.  Many interns are named and their actions described (throwing strawberries, nudity, etc.): Cream Pie, Ricky, Love Buzz, Clayton, Frankenberry, "Intern Matt Damon," Adam, Eyepatch guy, David, Evan, Anthony Comey, Bill, Nosferatu, Tim, Scott, Bobby the Champ (becoming "Bobby Nohomo"), and Harry T. Specific incidents like Clayton’s Times Square blunder, an intern texting Opie's girlfriend, and other mishaps are recounted. A lengthy, mocking interview with Love Buzz, the current lead intern, highlights his perceived lack of intelligence.

The final segment focuses on Love Buzz's upcoming date with Kelly. The hosts humorously and crudely tease him about his date plans, which involve a picnic in Prospect Park using only a towel.  The hosts repeatedly call the park "Rape Park."  Anecdotes about "Intern Dave" and a run-in with Patrice O'Neal are shared. Love Buzz's father's failed pizza business is briefly mentioned.  Love Buzz's date's picture is shown, prompting further crude jokes.  The segment ends with a Gamefly advertisement and a dedication to Ronnie James Dio's "Man on the Silver Mountain."

[00:18:00]  i'm watching hockey and i'm like i am fucking tired i was ready to go to bed i i was that tired  feeling where i'm like i can't stay up any longer right all of a sudden she goes oh my god my water  broke and and the first thought being a little selfish i'm like this means i'm gonna be up for  a while i'm really tired like you couldn't fucking i was thinking to myself you couldn't do this like  first thing in the morning nice and fresh we're all you know we're all uh awake so what was your  plan when the water broke you had bags packed already right my plan is to go into a complete 
[00:18:30]  fucking um turmoil like you you think you could control yourself you don't know what to do  did you go right to the hospital i went from i think we're gonna have the baby in my apartment  to what do we need to pack for the hospital we did but we forgot everything and then and and you  learn you don't need shit in the delivery room it's all take all kinds of stuff that just never even  came out of the bag no when we went to baby class they they told you you got to bring a focal point to 
[00:19:00]  the delivery room like a bottle of champagne like when you finally have the baby you could like  enjoy the light at the end of the tunnel or a nice picture of you two or a picture of an old  relative or some focal point fuck the focal point oh uh they're saying uh opie had sam bring the bags  to the hospital because erock was not interested in doing so yes erock declined so then uh i i get her to 
[00:19:30]  the hospital and uh i mean the movies and tv they suck because don't they make it seem like you're  going to have a baby instantly as soon as that water breaks or or usually they have to say it's  time yeah what it's time means is that you know the woman just completely destroyed something in the  apartment with all the water and whatever is there a lot well in her case it was a she she sort of broke  her water sort of well they had to get the ambiotic hook when i was in the hospital and you want to  want that story now what's the ambiotic hook why do they have to well these are the apollo to pull 
[00:20:00]  performers oh ambiotic is on stage and the sandman comes out well you get i'll reiterate what jimmy  said you get a doctor and it's an ambiotic hook and they go in inside your woman and they pop  something in there and now the water really breaks yeah now we can get things going going oh yeah  so get to the hospital and they put her in like triage to make sure she's definitely going to be having  the baby in the near future because they don't want they don't want to be taking up any fucking 
[00:20:30]  room in their hospital yeah they send a lot of people home sort of premium so it's now 11 12  o'clock at night and they're like yep she's gonna have this baby within the next 24 hours and i look  at her i go that that means we're gonna be up for another 18 hours she goes i bet you it's gonna be  hard on you oh oh she gave you a little dose of reality there huh yeah because i'm slapped you back  to earth that's all i'm thinking i suck when i'm sleeping i suck when i don't have sleep i go oh my god 
[00:21:00]  this is another 18 hours of not sleeping that was my first thought and then they uh put 18 years of  not sleeping yeah probably so what's wrong with your girl um i don't know but i think it started  before i showed up oh really yeah yeah it's one of those long-range problems  oh you mean showed up before you guys started yeah yeah you know we just it was just fighting  it was just yeah was it over anything good one danny was it over anything um important anything 
[00:21:30]  relevant at the time no it just came out of left field misunderstandings things like i thought you  said there's nothing worse than when you when you're trying to communicate with a person  and you feel like you're talking to them through glass and and there you're not hearing each it's  like but that's not what i said no but i told you that and like what's happening do we have don't we  have the commonality of language so uh all right so she tells you it's gonna be much harder on 
[00:22:00]  you obviously yeah well you know she has she's got a sense of humor so she's beating me up a little  bit and she has a nice little line there and then um they move into the uh delivery room which is  a really nice hospital room really nice it was overlooking the river on the east side there the  east river it was gorgeous and we're and then uh her parents came up in the morning um fast forward  i guess but somewhere in the middle of the night they had to get the placenta hook and they they  realized that not all the water was was broken oh and that's when i was dozing off and i woke up to 
[00:22:30]  see some doctor with a hook going inside her oh that's great water i'm like what the  fuck yeah oh god damn it let me see what's that he's showing placenta and i mean the ambiotic uh  uh oh my god see i didn't get to see that it's like a bokeh burger  oh that is disgusting it looks like a fucking uh um what are those a stingray like a big what's 
[00:23:00]  the tail coming off that's the umbilical cord the other end of it it looks like a possum that was run  over it looks like a prolapse yeah yeah it looks like if you're looking at a point like dead on  you can make a beret out of that i could look silly who sure would you can a little davy crockett  hat you can almost make a toupee out of it a wet toupee oh boy so anyway uh that thing away daddy  let me try to fast forward so look so now the contractions they slowly start building and the 
[00:23:30]  pain gets more and more and she she was a trooper around three in the morning she's like i can't  take anymore and when the women tap out to get the epidural they're like i'm done i'm done i can't  fucking do this anymore so we call on the people to do the epidural and they're uh they're getting  ready to do it they literally have the needle out and stuff and they go they got a call for an emergency  c-section well we got to go what so when she tapped out and said i can't do this anymore they 
[00:24:00]  came back like two hours later oh she should have tapped out sooner uh yeah well a lot of women want  to try to you know go as far as they can without yeah without any like that's called dash while when  you when you just yeah i mean it's crazy it's it's it's yeah that's the what they want to try to do so  then they came back and finally gave her the shot which numbed everything so we both got to sleep for a  little while and i woke up next to her to see the doctor with the ambiotic uh hook going okay we  got to speed things along i don't think she totally broke her water and they got in there and popped 
[00:24:30]  it and then the gusher all over the place holy mackerel all over the place and then her parents a messy  thing this whole thing birth is a fucking mess ah that was like four in the morning so we're already  six hours in since the water broke and then uh her parents got there around seven eight in the  morning and now it's a hospital room she's got the epidural so the pain's not that bad so we're  hanging out we're eating cookies we're drinking coffee we're socializing the sun's coming up we're  watching tv and she's like you know she's dealing with it no problem fast forward a few more hours 
[00:25:00]  and this beautiful room turns into a a room of of of horrors they wheel in a big metal table with all  sorts of tools of destruction just in case they need it like the end of braveheart right right they  leave the window open so you can look out the window yeah yeah yeah yeah there's how it was set  up i don't think anyone could really see in and then uh doctor puts on some kind of welding thing

[00:28:30]  oh fuck a lot of people yeah some people have these  but is the water cold or warm ah probably like uh probably the temperature of the baby  she's laying in the tub no it's now it really it looks like the feeling you've had as you were  taking it to that won't do what your body is saying but that's that feeling like you're in pain  this lady here has a nice badge by the way 
[00:29:00]  jimmy it's like a baby head coming out  then you would enjoy childbirth because that's what i'm trying to get at they all get a little  plump jimmy yeah why does she have a bathing suit top on we can jerk off to this yeah she's showing 
[00:29:30]  a snap she's a little modest about her titties yeah why don't you just cover your eyes too into a  fucking burka you know that's the one thing they don't cover that's gonna take a while huh yeah  let's fast forward get to the good part yeah yeah because it's just it's making me grab my crotch  you want to get to the good part you gotta rewind nine months oh god wow the kid just kind of  your head come out uh yeah mine  yeah you fucking like that some women have orgasms wow wait that was pretty quick once it 
[00:30:00]  starts coming out and then she just hands it right to the mother yeah i sort of uh i sort of  saw that same thing except for the water oh they're dabbing they're dabbing the fucking vagina  now well they could clean up uh nicely if it's already that kid's great and she gave birth to a  gray thing um it's a gray baby alien yes they come out gray and purple jimmy yeah they gotta  breathe i guess huh and then they they quickly change thank god but when my uh when my son was 
[00:30:30]  born the head pops out and the whole thing turns toward you i'm like ah alien like an alien thing and  then the rest of it pops out there's a placenta attached baby's gray i thought they were all bloody  and red no no they're gray they're blue they're purple they're every color but the one you want  did the doctor did the doctor smack it to make it like that i don't remember because then dr smacked opi  i listen to your show a couple of pigs 
[00:31:00]  me and and the wife and the mother-in-law were all crying i'm like wow this is a really strange scene i  think me and the mother-in-law really bonded yeah yeah you can't like you know be in a birthing room  together and not bond holy who was her dad and brothers and stuff uh down the hall the waiting  room with the cigars yeah dancing with fedoras on and then i mean there's blood everywhere she didn't  she didn't puke or shit thank god because they they they teach you that that your your girl could be 
[00:31:30]  puking and shitting she didn't have any of that uh and then uh and then they're like daddy you want  to cut the cord i go no i don't want to cut the cord that's no that's that's overrated no you do it  i'm paying your job right you want to come in and do a break right thank you fucker so someone said i  said births no one kid was born one kid um i go no i said no and they hand me the scissors i go no i  don't want to and they they basically insisted so then you take these scissors and you gotta think 
[00:32:00]  they're razor sharp they have to be right even with that it was it was like safety scissors it's  like cutting through a ligament man how uh like i couldn't like i couldn't get it at first you know  when you like have to kind of line up the scissors to get a good cut yeah that's sort of what i was  doing what do they do if and then i'm like this is how is this fun what do you do i thought it was a  quick maybe snip no that is like like three or four times i get through it but if you don't have 
[00:32:30]  scissors what do you do if you have a natural birth and they see wherever you are and you don't have  scissors i probably use your teeth i think of the oldie days like the engines yeah yeah do that  opening a a package like a kid's toy with your teeth opening space food yeah oh it's like the plastic  of a like a kid toy you know where it's hard to get through wow really dude i didn't realize that i  thought it was a lot softer how close do you cut to the kids they put their two finger like two 
[00:33:00]  and two fingers on this side two feet you know what i'm doing here yeah so they give you a space  to cut in between they give you a lot of room and then they run the kid off 10 feet away to a heating  lamp and then a heating lamp how long has he landed the heating lamp a few minutes they give him  fingerprints and freaking put something in their eyes give him a couple shots oh immediately yeah  pretty amazing man jesus christ as soon as he came out i'm like who are you it was this who are  you you're this strange thing because you don't know him yet it's yours but then it turns your 
[00:33:30]  strange thing oh then it turns immediately then you're like just completely can't look at it as i  say it's but completely in love but you're just like holy crap this is just amazing oh my god  i'm just this is this is scaring you right like oh no it really is uh you're just describing how  he felt when his keg was wielding who are you i'm the beer delivery guy oh okay 
[00:34:00]  then um no it's it's it's amazing and then uh then they finally then the room that i was just  describing where we're having cookies and coffee and it was just all nice like a nice really nice  hospital room with some nice visitors just is a mess you're like holy this is the same room  then they wheeled us out freddie krueger was in there yeah they wheeled us out and thanks to kenny 
[00:34:30]  he pulled some strings we got a nice private suite at the hospital it was sweet really nice how he does  those things i don't know how he does these things because i try to do it on my own i really try to do  things on my own and i realize i don't get that far and then i call kenny to do the exact same task  and he has completely different results completely he threatens to just keep talking to them all right  we'll get the suite do you promise never to call again sir yes it went from uh mr hughes we'll see  what we could do it's first come first serve basis but we'll see what we could do to we're sitting in 
[00:35:00]  this room waiting to see where we're going to go and like basically the head of the hospital and two  other people are in like whatever you need whatever you need we're going to put you in this blah blah  blah blah i don't know how he does it how does he do it does anyone know i have no idea of his  magic yeah and then um i don't know i mean i could talk about this all day but we got to talk about  other stuff but uh now she's got a breastfeed right so this we're fast forward a little bit so wait the 
[00:35:30]  first night you get the kids in a blanket it's all off the heating lamp and she's just you guys are just  holding it right yeah then it goes to the nursery for a little bit so they could kind of like nurse it  because i mean your wife's beat up speed up she didn't tear by the way and that's good because  of the nine pound four ounce it was because it was long if it if it was a nine pound four ounce with a  big head we probably would have some major problems right oh jesus but it was it was a long how long  is it 22 what's normal i don't know 22 is pretty freaking long though it's already out of newborn 
[00:36:00]  clothes everything that everyone got is thank you by the way can't wear any of it can't wear any of it  i mean some of it but by next week no definitely not but then um they wheel us off to our room it's  in the nursery then they bring the baby in it's like oh time to breastfeed even though the milk  hasn't come in yet well we could talk about that too i don't know that this i don't know this woman  that's living in in my apartment right now it's just motherly duties and huge 
[00:36:30]  she had nice ones they're huge huge yeah huge leaking all over the place oh god no  oh no this is just yes it's just it's just i i i can't but i'll end with this for now and then i  don't know maybe some other stuff will pop up but um she's got a breastfeed so they need someone to  show her how to do it so this is there you go that's i that's jesus christ danny yeah he pulled 
[00:37:00]  up a lactating breast on the uh computer and well she's squeezing him and it's just well if you take  your finger and and you push above the nipple toward the nipple ant you could get some flow going you  could actually all right oh god you're right you don't want to go to lactate in your mouth that's a  fetish for a lot of guys yeah well not for this guy i'm i'm okay i don't so so that they have uh 
[00:37:30]  uh lactating consultants i think they're called consultants something like that wow how do you  convince people that that's your job to go and squeeze tits that's a great gig well i watched a  lot of women grab my my girl's breasts last week i'm like how about you ask next time they  think we're you all right yeah that's so disgusting it's sugar water like oh i don't  care are you all right she's just lactating oh she's got a nice set would you lick that mirror 
[00:38:00]  clean it shut it no it's a piece of glass there's an asian woman lactating onto it and she's showing  how it drips and it's like 30 little strands of lactated milk from both sides just leaking down  would you lay into that like a rain gutter and drink it oh why no it's life-giving milk  she just looks at me like why i wouldn't either i might into lactation no of course oh god forbid  the asian girls could do it nicely now there's a fucking there's a mat laid on the floor of course 
[00:38:30]  and there's gonna be shit and piss can't you just be nice people no they can't of course the pubic  hair is zoned out but here comes the shit can't you just behave  so uh so they're they're called lactating consultants and this woman  she comes in an older woman she had to be easily 60 maybe maybe pushing 65 gray hair cut in kind of 
[00:39:00]  a lesbian way i should be nice because everyone was really nice but it was weird all of a sudden  she's i was going to tweet this she is demonstrating how to breastfeed and how to get the position right  by using a pillow making believe that's the kid and then squeezing her own fucking boob  did she whip it out no she didn't whip it out holy shit but she's squeezing it through her clothes  going yeah and if you do it this way i'm like what the fuck and then all of a sudden she goes all 
[00:39:30]  right you try now now you know she's got to take out her boob and then and then the woman is helping  with the baby and then kind of uh moving the breast and i'm like why are you touching my girl's boob  you don't have to touch it i guess that's her job as the consultant this is the lady with the  lesbian haircut yeah she loves her job i'm thinking she might love her job yeah right she gets to see  you know younger women topless all day of course within engorged breasts that's gotta be it's gotta 
[00:40:00]  be a dream for a lesbian they're engorged they're engorged and then maybe later we could talk about  the tar and where you could actually probably tar your roof with what comes out of uh the baby the  first couple days black sticky tar where you're scrubbing oh the hiney to try to get this black  off your baby oh my god yeah all right yeah jesus all right 
[00:40:30]  but then thank god after two days that turns into a mustardy uh yellow oh really how bad does  it smell baby shit's horrible isn't i haven't i haven't smelled anything bad yet people say it  doesn't smell at the beginning oh really i don't know that's what but like my brother said doesn't  smell at the very beginning but then after a little while it's it's the most heinous thing  i hear it's hard horrid oh god danny danny can find anything baby and i i've seen that many times 
[00:41:00]  laying down with shit blew out its leg hole oh my god that's like a soldier on omaha beach  yeah that's the mustardy uh yellow i've seen that but that doesn't smell believe it or not and the black  tar sticky stuff ridiculously i'm reading yay pudding oh yeah someone rolled that baby into a sloppy joe  yeah that's uh but it doesn't it doesn't smell you with man witch 
[00:41:30]  a meal is a meal  yikes i guess i guess it starts smelling when it turns green  i went through the black now we're in the mustard mustard yellow type thing damn and then when it  gets green i guess it starts uh smelling which is how long i don't i don't know i don't know you just  make this shit up as you go along i don't know robin williams had a very funny bit on childbirth on  the kids shitting or feeding algae or something yeah that the shit's hurting green yeah thinking algae 
[00:42:00]  so i think that's it for now is the kid talking yet people don't know anything about babies  can he walk yeah what's it do it what what it does is sleep yeah eat poop sleep eat poop sleep sleep  eat poop are you guys that's it switching back and forth to who yeah we're trying to figure out some  kind of schedule that'll that'll work for everybody so like i don't mind like bob bob our agent 
[00:42:30]  aunt he called a couple times and he's like oh you gotta get a baby nurse he goes i haven't i  haven't changed a diaper since the first kid really he hasn't done anything you just say that again  i thought he wanted 10 of your child it's a freaking baby nurse he said i changed a couple diapers with  my first kid by the third i haven't i haven't touched him basically really so he wants me to do  that i'm like i don't mind this i'd like to be the cool guy go yeah i'll fuck i ain't fucking doing 
[00:43:00]  this i don't mind it so far yeah maybe it'll get old maybe green poopy is more relevant now yeah right  on kevin oh yeah see people thinking back at the old green poopy days not knowing or thinking that uh  yeah you'd never be changing the green poopy diaper i wrote notes i i left them at home i think  i covered most of it there was some other crazy shit that happened i'll remember 
[00:43:30]  but what's the baby's cheeks a lot oh yeah  it's the baby oh uncle paul  and breaking breaking news i'm talking to my mom for the first time in a year and a half oh  shit well i we have to we have the baby on mother's day oh my god great and i know it's my  dad's doing from from beyond the grave even though i don't know what i believe in beyond because he  always wanted us to make sure my mom was okay to keep the me me me thing going and this is his way 
[00:44:00]  of going hey look stupid i'm gonna make i'm gonna make uh your baby born on mother's day and then make  you think about a few things how was that call well in true fashion i decided to cop out i'm like i know  i know i have to at least call her and tell her that uh you know she's a grandma for the i think  12th time at this point so i waited till 4 30 in the morning  you know uh because my logic is all right i'll leave a message on her answer machine there 
[00:44:30]  right and then when she gets the message she's not going to really know when yeah and then i could  fill in the blank like oh you must have went to you must have just went to bed i must have just  missed you so 4 30 in the morning i call her rings twice rings three times i'm like okay  machine's gonna pick up this is gonna work perfect all of a sudden i hear hello i'm like oh  fuck but but then we had a nice conversation oh i thought you agreed to say so i hung up 
[00:45:00]  now then we had a nice conversation so we've been talking a little since wow  yeah yeah look at these little changes going on it's been a crazy weekend it was weird when  ope walked in this morning he said look guys from now on no profanity on the show so i don't think  things are gonna change you know how many times i said fuck it in the first hour i wanted to open  with that i think that's a lack of sleep i wanted to open with and say that we're not allowed to  curse anymore but the third word out of your mouth was fuck i know okay that's good clear my throat 
[00:45:30]  it's called an amniotic hook did i say amniotic hook you said amniotic hook i thought oh  amniotic hook so uh my girl's up for a feeding right now all right all right she did okay with  this break good feeding i didn't get too graphic i don't think huh when when is feeding time oh every  two hours every two hours sounds like you with kenny

[00:49:30]  babies like me they just do i put my finger out they grab yeah they're good right yeah kids dig me so  any other questions i think i covered most of it yeah that was uh that ran the gamut and  honestly i was trying to get in here last week but i i just i was i i didn't know i didn't know  where i was dopey radio show i didn't know where i was though i figured we'd love to film lucky louis 
[00:50:00]  i didn't know where i was though it's a sleek thing it's a different type of tire though i don't  mind this tired yeah radio tired and this tired is the two different things i don't want to take  a break yeah wow yeah yeah we'll take a little break get into why jimmy and his girl is fighting  i honestly are fighting there really is no honest reason it's just nonsense it's it's like one of 
[00:50:30]  those where you're just what does it start with it always starts with something so silly i it was a  couple days ago i was kind of cranky so then like she's moving too rough in the bed which woke me up  i'm annoyed and that annoyed you yeah because it almost seemed like it was too much but then the  next morning because i woke up again do you even understand that you have an extremely attractive  girlfriend and if she's moving around in the bed she's in the bed with you you don't think of that 
[00:51:00]  when you're not i don't care i don't care what they look like when they're waking me  i wouldn't care if it was fucking katherine hepburn in 1943  fucking moonwalking over my dick with her face  beat it shaky i'm tired  they all look the same when they're waking you up it drives me nuts and so then whatever i'll get  into it after it's just wow and uh perpetual just annoying each other things and we got to talk about 
[00:51:30]  uh ronnie james d.o after the break yes what a fucking bummer man and then this other bummer this  other thing where uh i i don't know if we could get find the audio or something that caller that we  called a complete retard was right for saying why don't they just lower a tube down and and collect  the oil with the two this guy hit it right on the button and we beat him up as a retard with the 
[00:52:00]  dumbest idea ever and it's exactly what uh bp's doing to clean up this oil spill can we find it  yeah we should find what he said and see what assholes we sound like  fucking idiots they're just dopes with microphones we could listen to any break to see what assholes  we sound like that's true just pull anything did you like that dj clip too oh yeah that's i gotta i  gotta thank colin kane that is a funny one colin kane's a pretty funny comic he's on his way up and  i follow him on twitter i think it's colin kane with a k and uh he he sent me a video while i was 
[00:52:30]  out of uh it's called worst dj or something like that on youtube you've seen it danny yeah i did read  a report though well not a report but like an update that it wasn't actually the dj it was just some  drunk guest oh really it was like kind of took over the mic it was one of those situations it's like  that one of those drunk driving and buzzed driving commercials where the guy's playing the drums  the guy's playing the drums and the other guy leaves and bounces into the door but he has his  car keys people have been sending to me for a week i'll retweet it on uh op radio on twitter but uh 
[00:53:00]  show it show it to jimmy look at this jimmy really fast just a drunk idiot  on stage is they're doing the conga line or is it conga or congo that's a woman it's like meatloaf  and fight club that thing on the left is horrendous yeah it's a woman in a horrible sweater with sort  of big boobies but a mullet now also the guy this is an edit by the way they added in the air tonight 
[00:53:30]  you can tell he walks over to the women with the the fat boobs and just starts playing why is he  smacking her tits did you see that  why is he doing that i don't know i'll throw this on the twitter it's too visual but basically  he walks over to her starts slapping her boobs because he's bored and she is what a mug on her  and she doesn't even move she's had enough of his drunkenness it's probably his wife oh really i'm 
[00:54:00]  guessing yeah because she didn't slap him oh yeah maybe it's maybe it's yeah she's had enough of his  malarkey best wedding guest ever all right no one knows who this guy is why he's bashing this woman's  tits yeah it's stupid it's like some drunken fourth of july party in atlantic city or july  second and third at the borgata i'm so good wow i didn't see i didn't even see that one coming  of course she didn't almost sounded like a plug no all right uh did you guys get the name out there 
[00:54:30]  oh yes yeah yes because we were wondering for uh for most of the week what's the name  what's the name what's the name well then how did you how did you decide on that one i wanted carlin  bad yeah for george carlin she wanted jackson and i said with jack jackson's a cool name but i said  with michael jackson dying every baby in the next year or two is going to be more named jackson yeah  and sure enough our first doctor's visit the first name we heard was jackson stop doing that oh really 
[00:55:00]  so i'm like say so we went with hudson because we live uh over the hudson river so it has sort of  some meaning kind of a new york name and uh frederick for uh my dad middle name frederick i i always  thought it was frederick all these years but then when you're naming the kid and it's kind of important  as you write down on a birth certificate i learned that no my dad's name was actually frederick frederick  you have to throw the e in the middle of fred and yeah i didn't know that well you don't 
[00:55:30]  want to screw up the birth certificate no and that sounds very ethnic and sam's father for me who  i barely know goes i refuse to call him hudson i'm going to call him fred really loves the well  because we know sam's father is an old school guy of course so he goes i refuse to acknowledge  that his name's hudson i'm going to call him fred freddy or frederick mustache with his handlebar  mustache he's old school sam's dad seems very good at not acknowledging certain things like the  ethnicity of his son i'm going to not acknowledge that my son has thick eyebrows and kinky black man 
[00:56:00]  hair i'm going to tell people he's mine are you saying that sam's father has had to look the other  way for the last 27 years oh boy fucking cuckolding as an art form over there did you uh hear when uh  did you get any feedback when jay moore was saying that his name was his name was lamar yeah that's  pretty funny yeah fucking jay lamar i bought his people just like what the fuck lamar why do you  call him lamar i uh i bought his book he didn't give you one yeah that's what i tweeted i'm like 
[00:56:30]  how would you fucking give me a book just because we're friends i mean i can afford to buy his book  but how about you do the right thing but i uh i bought it on my kindle which is starting to look  outdated is it yeah yeah i've seen a lot of ipads oh shit and then i see my kindle i'm like well i  could i could download a book and read it well and that's about it if uh if you were here when bobby  was here with his ipad you definitely wouldn't get an ipad why what happened he just can't sell 
[00:57:00]  shit you can't figure it out because we were we were having a little conversation with him about  his ipad going all right go ahead sell it what does it do that i can't do on my iphone dude it's got  such a bigger screen all right but the reason i have the small screen is so i can put it in my  pocket and go i'm not carrying it around right but dude and then he just goes into that well his  first vagueness his first major selling point was the fact that you could use it as an alarm clock  yeah which i think my timex iron man could do back in 1992 and then the next day he was late 
[00:57:30]  showing up because his alarm didn't work on the ipad so he screwed that up and then he's just going  through the vague things where he goes you know you're there boom you slide and he just slides  his finger around the screen and just goes boom bang you get coffee you drink you do this now i  could look at this bang and he's doing he's saying all the things that i already do on my eyes like  you should go dude you wake up you check your email you check your twitter and i'm like i do that  yeah i do that with my i do that so why do i need this for i got a mac pro and i got a blackberry i'm 
[00:58:00]  good i don't know why i need an ipad too i will tell you who can sell the ipad when you're out of the  house everything you need you could get on your phone right yeah what else would you need jonathan  but what else sold me on the ipad whoa how though what else would you possibly need yeah  every once in a while you want to see a video or something and you can't get it on your phone  you're like ah that sucks but in general you got everything you need after you leave the house when  you got a iphone or a blackberry or he just showed me dude like he just presented like because it's got 
[00:58:30]  that like case that goes over that make it can stand up and you can watch videos on it and he was just  showing me how you can stream from netflix live streaming movies so you don't have to download  them he just he went through it and he really my manager really did it i wanted to smack him in the  fucking face you know what in all fairness i mean you do a lot of traveling it seems perfect for someone  that travel for one night away yeah aunt doesn't travel i don't travel the average person doesn't  travel maybe a couple times a year right but for someone like you you're doing your trips to la 
[00:59:00]  and you can watch movies and then i sort it i kind of get it however do you know the ipad you  cannot purchase with cash or an apple gift card you have to use a credit card those scumbags now why  is that their argument is they want to be able to track them all so people aren't giving them overseas  but i don't really care about that jonathan said he was online behind and in front of them was some  kid whose grandmother had like given him money and they wouldn't sell him an ipad some  fucking teenager because he had us currency and uh they the gift cards are like i forget what  bullshit excuse they use but the bottom line is they just want more money right if they've sold 
[00:59:30]  you a gift card they've already gotten that money so they want ipad money on top of your gift card  money but that's just that's just for apple because if you go to best buy and buy an ipad you can  whatever you want despicable apple is fucking i buy it with drachma yeah you get you go to the apple  store you have to buy it with a that is disgusting that's why that's why i don't go to the apple store  as as most uh as much as uh the average person because i i don't like i don't i don't i don't  like that feeling that they're trying to control everything i love my mac pro i'm not gonna 
[01:00:00]  fucking lie yeah but i i don't want to go uh the iphone route and i i don't like how they do certain  things they're sold out everywhere the ipads anywhere i look yeah i know i'm gonna reserve  them we're not hurting we're not hurting them hey uh louis ck is online man oh louis i was just uh  watching some videos of yours last night matter of fact you were yeah you got two uh you got two  promos for the new show that's going to be on fx and uh the promos are hilarious they're on your 
[01:00:30]  youtube channel do you know about that yeah yeah i put those up there yeah there's two well i'm not  i wasn't sure if someone else was running it or not there's uh two 30 second spots on louis ck's  youtube channel i think that were just uploaded a couple days ago for the new show hilarious  thanks man thank you i like how you're i like how you're filming the stand-up for your show  like it it it's it's from the side and it's it's awkwardly too close  yeah exactly and i know i know you did that on purpose so that's why i'm saying it 
[01:01:00]  yeah no the camera just stands right on stage with me on a steady cam and it's meant to be very uh  first person instead of like from you know across the room yeah i noticed that uh that angle and i  noticed that the the feel you were going for and i was like right on louis i i think the show is  going to be a huge success but hey opie though i called to say congratulations about the baby  that's great uh great news man well i know louis uh louis a proud father and he can relate to a lot 
[01:01:30]  of the things i've been saying today he loves his uh two daughters and i appreciate that lou  hello listen uh all i can say can i give you some advice yeah go ahead look just let let this  transform you don't try to stay the same person because you're gonna it's gonna kill you if you  try to stay the same person yeah i i already see freaking changes but i'm going with it i'm going  with it i think a mistake a lot of dads make is they let the mom tell them how to do everything and 
[01:02:00]  they work from her list right and they do as little as possible and avoid it as much as possible  thinking they can just stave it off yeah but if you do the opposite and you dive in and you use your  male skills yeah like find your own solutions to yeah and uh and like you have it be like a project  like a gadget that you just got yeah just get really good at it right then you get into it and  you start taking pride in it and it's actually fun right and you can start telling her stuff  like you don't know he needs uh he's he needs to sleep you don't know oh wow this is like figured 
[01:02:30]  it out this is like real advice i was waiting for the punchline but that was actual real advice from  louis ck i just think it's important because a lot of dads screwed up and uh because it's coming  the responsibility for the kid is coming because she's gonna get so she's gonna become just a  disaster she's gonna get totally exhausted right she's gonna hand you the baby and you gotta get  used to the shit smell right and you gotta get used to how heavy the kid can feel uh if you get used 
[01:03:00]  to it now you'll get you'll get immune to cucket smell in your face right uh to pee in your mouth  oh oh i got peed on already i forgot to mention that one and god you get jealous of uh the stream  they can get going a newborn stream could hit the bed the wall ah the good old days the good old  days is right no he's got a brand new pump yeah he does and it's it's unbelievable yeah and the  kid's not uh well now a week old three four days in it's peeing and hitting the wall already wow 
[01:03:30]  because it takes off you take off the diaper and for some reason he thinks oh i could pee now  so hey i'm on a set and i gotta go i just wanted to say that and congratulations and go talk  yourself oh louis louis you roll i love the louis ck thanks brother there goes louis and yeah check  out his uh his uh promos for his fx show on his youtube channel yeah louis hysterical man all right  let's break it let's take a little break so what we're doing after the break ronnie james dia we got 
[01:04:00]  to find the phone call about um yeah the guy gave us what the bp people needed to do over a week ago  and we laughed at that guy and they exactly took his advice they did right yeah and uh and other  things we'll figure it out  so 
[01:04:30]  freaking bomber huh are you leaving the lyrics in good  it sucks  yeah  yeah  fucking pipes  do me wrong  you're a bringer of evil  the devil is never a maker 
[01:05:00]  the less that you give  you're a taker  so it's  so it's on and on and on  it's heaven and hell  oh well  oh well  oh  oh 
[01:05:30]  the lover of life's not a sinner  the ending is just a beginner  the closer you get to the meaning  the sooner  the sooner you know  that you're dreaming  so it's on and on and on  oh it's on and on and on 
[01:06:00]  it goes on and on and on  here in the air  ronnie james dia  lost him yesterday  67 years old  what a bummer  you're kidding me  i was telling jimmy before the show i wasn't a big fan  but every time i heard a dio song i would never turn it off i would i would actually turn it up  if other people were playing dio is totally into it but never never went out of my way to to 
[01:06:30]  to buy dio records or songs i love i i even love what he did with sabbath man he did uh  it's it's it's it's like an epic ozzy left it's like what's gonna happen and then he came in  and did mob rules and heaven and hell yeah and then back i think it was 90 i want to say 95  they came back for dehumanizer and uh one live album i i fucking love dio man dio was just  his voice is amazing yeah great uh yeah voice i mean come on and the guy 
[01:07:00]  right up to the end had had all the pipes some people lose their voice you know that guy could  still scream out a song that was great we saw them i mean i wanted eddie trunk we saw him tape  the uh the live dvd heaven and held it at radio city and it just he gave you chills how good this  guy was he was 66 how good this guy was live yeah it's fucking frightening and there were rumors all  weekend long that he died and then that was like a the hoax but i bet you he really did die and they 
[01:07:30]  kind of wanted to keep it to themselves for a day or two yeah and then it was official yesterday that  uh ronnie james deal lost his battle with stomach cancer 67 years old he was just in here it seems  like what about a year ago yeah it wasn't that long ago but and uh one of the nicest most appreciative  guys we've ever had on the show so freaking nice man so cool yeah he was a very he's a big comedy fan  he was he was a genuinely nice guy man and uh i met him times here and then out of the studio and he was 
[01:08:00]  never any different like he was not just radioed nice he was just a nice person man yeah and uh  that's sad man on the silver belt i uh every time i i hear him i i think of that goddamn south park  episode where they had dio come out and just sing holy diver every so often he was just that on stage  a cartoon dio yeah there he is on south park and he actually thought that was pretty funny yeah you  you know he has a little had a sense of humor he might now who knows where you go right who the 
[01:08:30]  fuck knows darkness nothing oh it's funny i guess god needed a heavy metal guy i know to make devil  horns so he could laugh you're with god don't do the devil horns anymore he uh i was actually surprised  he died because it looked like he was doing better that's what everyone was saying it looked like he  was doing better the little we know we we thought he was doing okay i'm so annoyed too because i was 
[01:09:00]  supposed to when i went out in september to start with the leto taping i was out there for like two  weeks and florentine had a raid a lunch with dio oh really i could have had lunch with dio but  fucking my i think i had to do something during the day here radio and i flew out later i just you know  there was no way to coordinate it yeah my sad tail yes that is a sad you know what i'm probably glad  i didn't because i would have just been it we had great sweet interviews on the air he was nice he  was always nice when i saw him out are you trying to attach yourself to the tragedy no the point i'm 
[01:09:30]  making is if i had had lunch with him i probably would have a shitty memory yeah because i would have  tripped on myself and said something stupid the shitty memory would have been watching him only have a  couple bites because you know oh god right probably probably wasn't enjoying food too much at that  point in his life right in september yeah yeah he just announced it i think fuck it just sucks  stupid time dumb time is trying to get all of us oh it's our enemy that time is our enemy 
[01:10:00]  and a man tick tock but ronnie james dio we have his last appearance on our show  oh yeah he called in for my birthday but it was very quick it was like one line  you want to hear a little audio of ronnie we got it uh worried about well see if anything uh here is  worth playing uh worried about redoing what you did in the past deals eligibility for the rock  and roll hall of fame are there any modern bands you like creepiest fan jim is amazed how his voice has 
[01:10:30]  held up which members most uh high maintenance on the road then you got stalker patty how'd you manage to  survive all these years that's the clip that might be the clip let's go with that one if we have if  you only play one clip this year patty patty cursed them uh all right we'll play this thanks patty in  honor of yeah kill dio you dummy passing of ronnie james dio from his last appearance on our show i just  wanted to know i'm very impressed with dance that managed to still be just as significant now as they 
[01:11:00]  were 35 years ago the only other band like it would be the stones what makes you survive so long  oh when groups like the beatles my favorite band disappear after five years and then they turn out  solo artists what makes it what what is it that oh it's not like it why couldn't it claim her it wasn't  a bad question for the first 45 minutes oh god why could it with that voice the clip is only a minute 17 
[01:11:30]  shit she's already wasted 25 seconds yeah 35 years is your nightmare your voice ending up like that  when you wake up one morning no i'm just going like oh my god i gotta quit and two of them didn't  die too like the bingo can i say that i want to hang myself because she has so far asked probably  the best question uh i'll answer it my way my way uh which is that you know when you when you find 
[01:12:00]  people that you like to do something with so much you know god you'd be a fool to stop doing it i think  and we just probably happen to be a collection of people who are you know all feel exactly the same  way about that that you know it's it's it's such a joy to make music that people like you do it for  yourself first of course and then if you see that reaction from people like yourself i mean just you  know why would you ever want to stop i mean i i never want to stop i will but i don't want to and i mean  so i can't speak for the rest of the guys but i'm sure that that's part of all they feel damn 
[01:12:30]  man but it's funny when you say when you look out and see people like yourselves imagine if you  saw 17 000 patties yeah oh how depressing that would be oh no this is the demo  some bands like the beatles only last five years and then they go to the solo albums and  do you shut up that was a hell of a five-year period though patty yeah kind of changed music  right dummy you want to hear any of these others different generations love sabbath bands still play 
[01:13:00]  because they can not because they should ragging on each other for bad ideas tony puts a snake in  ronnie's car writing the lyrics another dio album anything else comes to mind it's up to you yeah i can't  rest recall i know when you hear his voice and everything it depresses me yeah why don't we just play  man on a silver mountain get it you know for ronnie yeah you wanna and then we could eat a little  depressing one do that yeah let's do another uh little uh what i i have to before i forget 
[01:13:30]  because ronnie ronnie would have  i was trying to help you out there yeah you know the fact that i'm at the borgata july 2nd and 3rd is  really unimportant but ronnie would have wanted you to go and have fun well he was a fan of comedy jimmy he  was uh tickets going well actually great yeah oh good you better get your tickets they're gonna  sell out it's gonna be great certainly they will i think they will sell but yeah he was a sweet guy  man and uh you know what our first break was an hour and a half so why don't we play man on the 
[01:14:00]  silver mountain i like that one do you mind jimmy no uh let's play that it's it's live though all i  have is live versions i have three versions they're all live what uh  trap dog trap dog only has the live cuts want to go holy diver i know why not  holy diver it's long it'll give you a little more time to  it's a great one i want more than a two minute  fucking yeah stand up and shout it's a fucking great 
[01:14:30]  holy diver it keeps a rainbow in the dark it keeps more people uh  tuned in let's do holy diver diver for uh country girl off mob rules we uh lost at the age of 67  yesterday to stomach cancer we'll uh we'll be back in a little bit kick's ass yes what were we saying  it yeah i was saying uh there's so many metal bands they listen to especially throughout the 80s the  whole hairband phase that were absolutely emulating ronnie james dio that that style of 
[01:15:00]  singing that you know that whole metal metal voice thing was dio that's  fucking dio's voice and uh none of them could hold a candle to him he was  fucking amazing and great live man i was just saying the break i saw them three days  after my sinus surgery i went to jones beach and saw motorhead heaven and hell and priest  fucking guy did he try to sing along and a big huge bloody snot rocket went flying out 
[01:15:30]  into the people in front of you heaven and hell my little nose was clogged  but he was just so fucking good live man and just once again man should be said  just a nice guy yeah a lot of them aren't nice and jimmy brings up the fact that a lot of people  that come through that door aren't nice no this is not touching it drudge report didn't have it  how out of touch are people to not understand this guy was a fucking i mean the shitty rock and roll  hall of fame doesn't even have him in but he was a fucking icon in in rock music as far as music goes 
[01:16:00]  in the music community he was fucking huge justin bieber gets a zit and uh it'll make the fucking news  really ronnie james dio dead fucking bieber and nothing justin bieber maybe maybe someone could  explain why why the world is fucking fall in love with bieber well he's got a great look  stupid justin bieber  yeah all the little girls love him and a few older men and nailed it though kid gets a

[01:20:00]  last night oh is that why he's freaking out you got the flyers yeah i don't know what's going on now  hey turn this off yeah you got the flyers and the canadians uh we're down to four teams we got  the blackhawks what uh the sharks what yeah blackhawks and sharks canadians what and the flyers what  what we're down to four teams and uh the flyers had one of the most unbelievable sports comebacks  ever i know you don't follow hockey yet but they were getting down three games to zip to the bruins 
[01:20:30]  and came all the way back and won the series completely insane yeah and i think they're still riding  off that high and uh they kicked the the canadians uh ass last night six nothing i think was the  final score travis yeah i gave up at four nothing i think i was too busy watching rivera get  fucking rocked i watched that in the gym yeah he gave up five runs five runs for him  fucking slam first one he gave up in eight years yeah it looked better to have him  fucking if you have a bad outing better to have it in may yeah yeah exactly but who gives a turkey 
[01:21:00]  they have been on a bit of a fucking slump the uh yankees they came out of the gate kicking ass  really and uh they're they're losing uh really they're dropping some games here yes want to hear  about a slump yeah that's in last place they were in first i think a month ago yeah but they went from  like they went from shit and then within two games they were up in in first and no our mets our  mets me and danny's met they started out like shit and then they went on like uh like i think at one  point they had won like eight of the last ten yeah and then they went right back to the 
[01:21:30]  shit again well the yankees are in kind of a fucking i don't want anyone to talk about slumps  oh oh right okay baltimore we're 12 and 26 you guys got it for good but you got your canadians  still uh in there i know once that's over my entire as a canadians fan how did you feel about  that uh that that soccer chant thing they were doing in philly last night it was that's that's your  song that's the canadians thing yeah and it's philly so of course they're going to do something  what is it what i'm fine do it for us please travis ole ole ole ole no no no i don't think 
[01:22:00]  it's done like that how's it done there's must must be a more enthusiasm ole ole ole ole  so ole in a box with a satin pillow no no what's worse that or the uh you know when they do that  for jose reyes at mets games often joke yes jose yeah jose ah but see now i'm not i'm not a philly  sports fan i'm really not even though i have a lot of uh roots down there now but i do appreciate the 
[01:22:30]  philly fan because now the uh i mean uh yeah philly meaning the the the city i'm a little tired  so you got the flyers the canadians playing the flyers in philly and they're getting their ass  kicked so the flyer fans decided to do the canadians chant what had to drink that had to drive them  nuts the whole place wow the whole fucking place was shoving that ole in in their face when we went  like two years ago to the playoff game and they were beating us they they did that same thing yeah  they really do know how to get under people's skin now really do now as a canadians fan you're not 
[01:23:00]  worried though right because they they had some bad losses in the playoffs and still yeah we we've  been blown out washington blew us out one game and pittsburgh blew us out one game so i'm hoping  that this is it they got out of their system dude you're yeah i haven't been here in a while your  fucking canadians took out the penguins since i've been gone that was fucked up took out the regular  season champs and then the defending stanley cup champs i really enjoy of course we'll probably  lose the flyers oh nice confidence wow that's great well no you know like of course that's how 
[01:23:30]  it would go you would take out the two best teams and then you would lose and i'm trying to i'm trying  to make this hockey thing interesting to you seventh seed playing an eighth seed the first time it's  ever happened that's crazy in a conference that's really crazy yeah you have four teams left and then  you have a seventh and an eighth seed playing each other and uh whoever wins that will uh play for the  stanley cup and then you got the black hawks and the sharks i i i could give a fuck about those two  teams i don't know anything about them i'm not even gonna lie so i gotta go flyers for the whole thing 
[01:24:00]  have to which being an islanders fan is kind of stupid but don't want the canadians and i don't  know anything about the black hawks and the sharks so what do i do do do i for a goof say the sharks  you would have to do the philly thing yeah it's like you kind of got them yeah they're obligated  well they're all excited had a lot of a lot of philly people up the last week and they're excited  gives you something to you know they're excited what am i gonna do all excited about i'm gonna root  for the canadians first of all they're not even an american team inhabitants where were we oh all 
[01:24:30]  right you got crying like a bitch yes i have now what's what's good about this new godsmack  song crying like a bitch the video has a lot of mma shit oh does it so there's a nice little  connection with the uh the mma oh is this the song that goes crying like a bitch kick him hit him  knock him down i don't i i haven't heard it wrestle that man to the ground that's my guess how it goes

[01:31:00]  No, it's chicken prosthetics.  Chicken, get it.  I think this was the single.  Nah.  No?  Then it sounds like the single.  It sounds like the single.  Yeah, you could throw this in the goddamn garbage.  So you made a mistake with the chicken foot.  I don't know if there's anybody that hasn't done that.  You know, you hear one song and at least...  So just fucking delete it out of your iTunes.  Yeah, but you can't just... 
[01:31:30]  They won't shuffle anymore.  I can't just do...  You can't just pull up the shit on your phone and delete songs.  Right.  You got to dock it and do it.  Which isn't a pain in the ass, I mean...  But I'm never thinking of it...  But you forget.  Until I'm shuffling and you're on the road.  Until the next time the chicken foot pops up.  Right, and then the chicken foot comes up.  The chicken foot.  The chicken foot.  The chicken foot.  Let's go to footer footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Real quick, that Godsmash one that you played earlier?  Oh, yeah.  That's actually about Nicky Six from Motley Crue.  Now, I... 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I was catching up on my Godsmack knowledge over the weekend.  And I did not realize they opened up for Motley Crue a year or two ago.  And they thought Motley Crue, or Sully did, thought they just were a bunch of dicks and had horrible attitudes and shit, right?  Yeah, you know what it is, though, is that Motley Crue, I mean, Nicky Six in particular, always has that reputation of...  I mean, you know, he's a fucking rock star, you know what I mean?  He's like Tommy Father, like, you know, that type of shit.  So he walks around like he's a fucking, you know, like a real big shot.  Just the typical shit, like you had that Wyland shit you guys had that Jimmy made you nuts. 
[01:32:30]  You know, like shit like that, I think, is what fucking just got fucking Sully like, all right, you know, I fucked this guy.  I'm a fucking rock star, too.  So he wrote Crying Like a Bitch for Nicky Six?  Yeah, and what they said was, he said that how they wrote it was, I think, whatever the fucking guitar player's name in Godsmack, right after whatever went down, they went back to the bus and they were fucking around.  And he had the riff, and then he said, Sully said he just picked up the other guitar and they just started rocking it out.  He goes, they wrote the song within an hour. 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  And Sully's a very nice dude, man.  He doesn't come off, like, he comes to my shows in Boston sometimes, and he doesn't come off like a rock star.  He just hangs out with, like, a couple of his friends.  And he's not a dick with an entourage.  He's, like, the fucking easiest dude.  Yeah, he's a cool dude.  So I imagine that would make him really sick to his stomach.  Hey, Footer, are you a big Godsmack fan?  Well, you know what it is?  I am a little bit, but, I mean, I'll use the term lightly.  I'm kind of, like, you know, I'm involved in the music industry a little bit, doing, like, publishing and shit and doing a lot of writing because a lot of my friends, you know, are, like, signed acts and shit, and I was in this, you know, back in 2000.  Right.  So I kind of got, I'm just, I got just involved with all these bands, and I love hearing their bullshit, you know? 
[01:33:30]  So if you want to check out Rev Theory, it's a new band, not really new, they got two albums out from Interscope, but they're about to blow up the heavy shit, but real marketable called Rev Theory.  You'll like them.  It's cool.  All right, right on.  No, I'm trying to, I'm trying to find out because this may be, it's maybe too inside, but remember Sully had a little fucking star tattoo under his eye?  He still does.  Yeah, yeah.  No, man, the videos I was watching looked like he had it removed.  Wow, why?  That's what I want to know.  Is there a story there? 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  Hmm.  We'd like the stories if they're good.  Never heard if there was a tattoo removal story.  Yeah, I don't know.  All right.  But you're not a, not a chicken foot fucking dude.  Chicken foot.  Oh.  Stephen S. writes, give Sammy a break.  The poor guy can't drive 55.  Yeah, he's a little angry.  Give him a little break.  He's a little angry.  The Red Rocker.  The Red Rocker wants to drive 55.  Give the Red Rocker a little break.  Not for chicken foot.  Well, why do we do this to ourselves?  Sammy is never, Sam, what? 
[01:34:30]  What was the song you said?  Red Rocker 55?  I can't drive 55.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Red Rocker.  They called him the Red Rocker.  He's the Red Rocker.  He'd wear red leather out on stage.  So he's the Red Rocker.  What's the matter with you, Jimmy?  Big dumb tampon.  Hey, bloody twat.  Sammy's always been nice to us.  I know.  He loves us.  If he came in right now, he'd give us all a big hug and then hand out some of his dumb tequila.  Sit down.  Yeah.  He was very nice, but this band stinks on ice.  He doesn't have a mean bone in his body.  Holy shit.  What are we doing to the guy? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, the fucking chicken foot.  With the...  I'd be...  I like...  Sometimes I take my iPhone, I plug it into the radio thing I got next to my bed.  And very rarely, because if there's nothing on TV, sometimes I just...  I'll put on some music.  You gotta be...  I'll hit shuffle.  And I could be on the brink of falling asleep.  And if a chicken foot song comes on, I go, motherfucker, and I have to roll over and  hit next one. 
[01:35:30]  But see, the shuffle could be your best friend, but you gotta edit that shit.  Yeah, that's why I gotta edit that chicken foot out.  You gotta get in there and you gotta edit it every once in a while.  I gotta clean out the chicken foot.  Yeah, get rid of the chicken foot.  Get that fucking shit out of there.  When is a guitar solo too much for you?  Nowadays, any guitar solo is too much.  Any?  Yeah.  It just...  I cannot appreciate the self-congratulatory, self-fucking...  The masturbatory guitar solo.  When it gets way too high up the neck, that's when it's too much for me. 
[01:36:00]  A little down here is cool.  You move up a little bit, but when they're...  Both hands are way up at the top of the neck, enough already.  If it's quick...  Enough already.  A quick fucking riff is fine by me.  By the way, we're dating ourselves because today's music doesn't have fucking guitars  at all.  Not anything.  It's some fucking one person playing a drum and one person playing a bass.  And someone with spoons is hitting a homeless guy and puts this out.  Two guy bands. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  It's like two people in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't understand what these kids are listening to.  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut.  I didn't know this.  Godsmack also has a new song called Aneurism about Bret Michaels.  Oh, God.  Who, by the way, unlike Ronnie James Dio, who they said was doing good, they had him on  death's door.  Well, no.  Donald Trump did.  Donald Trump did.  You know, the guy that got mad at us because he thought we might have exaggerated a little  something in the press and decided he can't talk to us ever again.  That guy who completely exaggerated how bad Bret Michaels was. 
[01:37:00]  Death's door.  He said it's not looking good.  Basically saying he's going to die.  Yeah.  And not only did Bret Michaels make a full recovery, he's going to be back on tour in  like a week.  Yeah.  Ten days.  Ten days, I think, from today.  He'll be back on the road.  Wow.  That's pretty amazing.  That is.  Because he was supposed to be dead.  Don't like the chicken foot, huh?  Oh, chicken foot.  Jimmy, you like the chicken foot.  What a mistake that was. 
[01:37:30]  I think Hagar, he has a really good voice.  I do acknowledge that.  But I think he stinks.  That's a great fucking...  Oh.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  You want a beer?  Yeah, I'm going to go grab a beer.  I'm going to take a piss.  I'm going to go out to my car and smoke some pot.  Then I'm going to come back, take another piss.  I'm going to try to move down a little. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, right.  No?  Is that...  It's...  I know it looks like it might be...  I'm saying...  He goes like five letters without a vowel.  How do you get that done?  Oh, God.  That's a name that desperately needs a vowel. 
[01:38:30]  Whatever.  Malmsteen.  He's fucking sitting there just jacking off with his guitar.  What about a little Cliffs of Dover?  At least that has a poppy kind of happy fucking...  It's a little happy song.  ...melodic thing.  It's not just random guitar solo thing.  What were some of the other...  Like Gary Hoey.  What were some of the other guitar heroes?  You got...  How do you say it?  Ingwee.  You got Stevie Vai.  All right.  Steve Vai.  Steve Vai, man.  You got Lester Paul. 
[01:39:00]  Joe Satriani.  Satriani.  Oh, Satch.  I got you.  What did he say?  Lester Paul.  Sorry, good.  We did a lot of stuff with Joe Satriani.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  What was his big song?  What was Satriani's big song?  Satriani had...  I think it was called Summer Song.  And it was also Surfing with the Alien, which I think a lot of people know.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Man.  You want to hear a little Surfing with the Alien?  Who wouldn't?  Who wouldn't? 
[01:39:30]  Let me hear some of this.  You got the live version, Trav Dog?  He couldn't find Man on the Silver Mountain, because that's officially a Rainbow Song.  So, why wouldn't...  We're going to end this show with that today.  It's all right.  You don't know Dio that much.  You want Surfing with the Alien?  Oh, yeah, we do.  Let's hear a little of that.  This isn't music.  This isn't music? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  He's surfing.  He's surfing.  Oh, here we go.  This is great.  Did he say, like, this sounds like I'm surfing with an alien?  No, it doesn't.  What does it sound like? 
[01:40:30]  It sounds like shit.  It sounds like fucking pure self-gratification.  I, uh...  When does this get old?  It already did.  This is like guitar players listen to this and go like, yeah.  Dude, you hear that fucking Surfing with the Alien?  Fundamentally, dude.  Oh, this is the best around. 
[01:41:00]  Look, this part's fucking really...  Oh, Steven S. from Bayshore has got it.  And Satriani's big hit was Nine Minutes, No Point.  I guess you gotta have a point to your song.  What is the point of this?  There's no point.  What do you do with this?  There's no singing.  There's no nothing.  But what do you do with it?  If you're a guitarist, you listen to it and go, oh, okay, I'm gonna try to play that.  It's like a challenge.  It's a game.  This was before video games. 
[01:41:30]  Guitars would get real guitars, plug it to real amps, and try to do what they're doing.  This is fucking Guitar Hero without a scream.  Well, when would you listen to this?  He's good, but seriously, you can't put it on at a party.  If you're driving around, you're not gonna put this on.  No, there's a talent there, but it's...  It's wasted, though.  It's not one you want to hear, which is odd because it's an audible talent. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, right.  Enough of this fucking guy.  The only point this guy has is under his hat.  Oh, shit.  I realized what I didn't miss in the last week.  What, the Joe Cetrini?  Cetrini.  Cetrini.  I miss this thing a lot.  I, um...  I had a Seinfeld moment this morning.  What happened?  That, uh...  And I hate this on a Monday fucking morning because I was pissed off that I missed two 
[01:42:30]  lights because of a giant fucking truck.  Trucks have gas pedals.  Step on it!  They turn up one of the streets, side streets going across town, and you gotta kinda go fast  to make all the lights.  And they're just lollygagging.  Bleh.  Like, just fucking...  I know, they don't give a shit.  I didn't know, Harry.  And I get stopped at one light, and I hit every light.  So it tacks another ten minutes onto the drive-in. 
[01:43:00]  It sucks.  So I finally make it out in front of the building, which now, because it took so long to get  here, there's cars parked all the way up the street.  One parking spot's there.  So I pull up, put my blinker on, I pull up past the parking space, because I'm gonna parallel  park in.  Right when I pass it, a van goes to forward shoot in to the parking space.  But he knows what you're doing, too.  Oh, he abso-fucking-lutely knew I was parallel parking. 
[01:43:30]  He thought I'd be one of those guys that saw him pull in and just drive away like, oh,  you asshole.  No.  I continued backing up, backing up, beeping my horn, and backing up.  It's like, no, you move.  I'll back right into you, motherfucker.  I don't care.  Car's holding up now.  My lease is up in fucking September, and I don't give a shit.  I will fucking back into you.  And I kept backing up.  The guy puts it in reverse, backs out.  I sweep it right in, parallel park. 
[01:44:00]  And as he's pulling next to me, he gives me a, look, that smirk mouth and the, like,  meanwhile, I was fucking backing in like a normal human being, parallel parks.  He knew I was doing it.  And he tried to slip in, thinking I was going to give up my ground.  Kenny comes over after that, because I get out of the car now.  I shut the door, and I point.  I go, fucking asshole.  And Kenny's like, I thought there'd be gunfire.  He had an erection. 
[01:44:30]  He didn't know why.  Kenny was very happy.  Like, I bet Kenny thought there would have been an altercation, because he was there.  He could have walked out.  Is there a problem?  I'm not even sure.  I think it was an air conditioning guy, which makes it even better.  Go fuck yourself.  Where was this?  Right in front of the building?  Right out in front of the building.  One spot.  But you have appreciation for those guys, don't you?  Back in.  Not anymore.  Really?  Blow me.  That a boy.  Blow me.  I call him to replace my fucking filters in my attic.  I don't get a call back.  These motherfuckers don't want to work anymore.  It's hot in here, bitch. 
[01:45:00]  Get working.  Get up in the attic, biatch.  Bring some Freon.  Give me a Freon hat.  And no, I don't even change my own filters anymore.  I don't know what my attic looks like, and I don't want to know what it looks like.  Sure you do.  In the mirror, you see it every morning.  No.  Attic.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  God damn, Jimmy Norton.  That's fucking quick, bro.  Yeah, that motherfucker. 
[01:45:30]  Jerry is so phony.  They know the episode.  That is a funny one, man.  Oh, why is it a Seinfeld moment?  Because I really don't know.  Costanza, George Costanza, went to Parallel Park and did the same thing.  He pulled up, went to back in, and somebody goes in for the forward park, and it started  a whole thing.  He's saying, no one pulls in forward.  And then, of course, they're like, no, the forward pull, you know.  So they had a big discussion about the forward pull in or the backward park for parallel parking. 
[01:46:00]  You pass the spot, and then you swing it in.  You can't do the forward parallel parking.  Unless you're trying to fuck somebody.  Not in New York, anyway.  No.  There's not enough room.  Unless you have a couple of spots.  Or you do what I do.  I do do the forward pull in if there's nobody trying to back into the spot.  Right.  But what you have to do is you pull in up the curb.  Sure.  And then turn back down the curb, and your front tire now drops perfectly where it belongs.  The back tire is where it belongs. 
[01:46:30]  So you can do it, but you've got to drive on the curb a little bit.  Nobody pulls in forward naturally.  Nobody.  Everyone does what you did.  You pull up, and you back in.  That's the way we all park.  You swing it in.  You're only doing it if you're trying to fuck someone over, which is what that prick was  trying to do.  There they are, with the cars front to back, and they stay there for hours.  What's that?  Seinfeld?  Seinfeld.  God damn show is still one of the funniest shows on television.  They're not front to back, though.  They're back to back, right?  No, that's the front of an old car and the back of a... 
[01:47:00]  Oh, which one?  The right one?  Oh, now I see it.  I thought that was the hood.  From my angle?  Never mind.  Yeah.  Too visual.  Visual.  Let's go to Doug in Boston.  Doug, way to go Bruins, huh, Doug?  Still hurting from that?  Yeah.  Fuck.  I was hoping because you said, go Flyers.  Well, you know.  Well, your Seltz are still in it.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a big Seltz fan, so that'll be cool.  Oh, my God.  Cleveland is out of their mind.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Because LeBron James absolutely played his last game. 
[01:47:30]  He's leaving.  If you guys in Cleveland think he's staying, you're insane.  He even took his jersey off immediately, basically saying, this is it.  I'm done.  Why did you want to leave Cleveland?  You think just for money and a bigger place?  Why does he want to leave Cleveland?  You're right.  It's a stupid question.  But, I mean, he's LeBron James.  Air conditioning guys want to leave Cleveland.  King James, they're going to have to take that giant fucking poster of him that's been  up there forever?  He's not staying.  There's no fucking way.  And they're now saying that he becomes a net, not a nick. 
[01:48:00]  Really?  A net?  Nets got a lot of money.  They got a guy that's fucking worth billions and billions of dollars, some Russian guy.  You got Jay-Z's connection with the New Jersey Nets.  It's Brooklyn, which is cooler than Manhattan.  I call it Crooklyn, yo.  Yeah.  Are they going to be the Brooklyn Nets?  That's a cool name.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a good book.  Jersey Nets.  Everyone's talking about moving around.  They're talking about taking the Islanders and putting them next to Citi Field now. 
[01:48:30]  Well, that would be better than Kansas City, because that's the other rumor.  Wow.  Being an Islanders fan.  I read a long article on the Islanders over the weekend, not looking good, because they  have money to spend.  The Islanders.  They have money to spend in the offseason.  But they're basically saying any player that's smart will not say, yeah, what the hell,  I'm going to go to the Islanders, because their future is up in the air.  That would be great.  So we're going to have another shitty year.  If they fucking leave, I'd love to see the NASA Coliseum flea market. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  That's what it'll turn into.  A big fucking flea market.  Yeah.  A bunch of dirtbags selling their shit right next to the worst fucking, the worst town  on Long Island.  Dude, I hate politicians.  Everyone knows that by now.  But I don't live there anymore.  Your fucking politicians on Long Island suck a dick.  Yeah, tell me about it.  They suck a dick.  Yep.  They're arguing this and that when it's so obvious the Islanders need a new fucking arena,  and it would be very good for the economy of Long Island, I would think.  Yeah.  And they're just arguing back and forth to the point where they're going to move this fucking 
[01:49:30]  team.  So they should just put them by Citi Field, have that whole sports complex thing there  with the tennis and that, and make that the big Long Island sports place, knock down  the Coliseum.  I would accept that.  Build a prison there so the fucking residents don't have to go too far to visit their loved  ones.  Fucking Uniondale.  Yuck.  The politicians on Long Island are blowing it with the Islanders.  Yeah.  It's so obvious.  Just pull the trigger and get this dumb thing done.  What else are they going to do with that area? 
[01:50:00]  What's the problem?  Yeah.  What could possibly be the problem?  Anyway, Doug, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah.  You guys forgot about the guitar solo.  Yeah.  Jeremy Garcia.  Are you a big deadhead?  Oh, the dead.  I know you are too, Opie.  I like the dead, I'm not going to lie, but Anthony, you can't stand up.  Oh, my God.  Some bitch dragged me to a dead show years ago, and it was three hours of them either 
[01:50:30]  playing their songs that I didn't know one of, or tuning.  Or jamming.  I had no idea what the fuck they were doing, and I don't think they did either.  Anthony described the Grateful Dead to the haters perfectly.  He says all it is is three hours of guys trying to tune their guitar.  Tuning up, playing different songs from each other, and hairy armpitted, hairy legged, stinky  hippie chicks in those fucking tie-dyed long skirts, spinning around with their hands above 
[01:51:00]  their head.  You didn't like the jam band stuff?  Oh.  Oh.  You don't like jam bands?  I like when a band, when I go to see a band live, and they start up a song that I've  heard, and I know, and is popular, and the place goes, ah, you're like, fuck, yeah.  You never want, ten minutes into a song, go, oh, oh, is that, oh, I know this song.  I think I know, no, this isn't it.  As they're slowly but surely getting into what the song is supposed to sound like. 
[01:51:30]  Dude, I went one of those nights, because you know how the dead just changes their playlist  every night, man?  They changed it to not one song Anthony knows.  I didn't get trucking, I didn't get anything that I knew.  Touch of Grey?  Oh my God, Touch of Grey, the place would have rioted.  Stop playing this commercial shit, man.  That's a great song.  They hated it, the deadheads hated it.  Fuck that, it's their best song.  That's right.  No, the deadheads were like, not into Touch of Grey, unless you made it into a 20 minute 
[01:52:00]  version.  But it's a good song, what about your cornball?  Which they did, by the way.  Maybe a little space and drums in the middle of it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Da da.  This is what, okay.  That's right, I'm getting older.  All right, hold on, so this is the beginning of Touch of Grey, what we should do, because they  have the Grateful Dead channel.  Yeah.  Find a live version of this.  Oh, Christ.  And we should have a contest, how long it takes for you to, oh God, I've lost my...  Oh, before you recognize that, it's Touch of Grey.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, you won't even know.  Do you have a live version of Touch of Grey?  You know the one time I need one?  You don't have it?  Hang on.  Is that a backbone?  Fucking paramecium.  See?  He's a one-celled creature.  Oh, because I thought you were saying somebody only had one mesium, he kind of gets himself  a pair of mesiums.  Oh, we got a name, man.  Yep.  Yes?  Fade that shit out.  If you find the Touch of Grey live, that's great.  I wanted a name. 
[01:53:00]  Chet from Long Island.  We were just talking about the Islanders and how they really just deserve and need an arena.  Everyone knows it.  It would be great for Long Island.  It would be great for hockey.  Because, you know, you got the Islanders, they won four Stanley Cups.  They should stay on Long Island and not move somewhere else.  It's like, they're talking maybe Quebec or Kansas City or, like Anne said, somewhere  in Queens.  But Queens is more like New York City.  It's kind of, it doesn't have that Long Island feel.  Yeah, four Stanley Cups.  Anyway.  Four Stanley Cups.  A decade before the fucking Iron Curtain fell.  I know, I know.  They basically have been shit for... 
[01:53:30]  The drive for five has taken a long fucking time.  They've been shit for 18 years, I think.  Was the last time they won a playoff series, I think.  Even I'm losing track.  Chet, what do you got?  Hey, good morning, Hope.  Welcome back.  Thank you, sir.  You know what?  This thing is so ridiculous.  You got this one bitch, Kate Murray, that's blocking this whole fucking deal for Wang to  build a mecca in the middle of that shithole Uniondale.  Yeah.  Kate Murray hates Wang.  Good bumper sticker. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got to explain, because we're talking to the whole country here.  He's right.  Anne's been there, too.  Where the Coliseum is, not only is the Coliseum a piece of shit arena, it's horrible.  You feel like you're watching minorly cocky.  It's dated, old.  But the rest of the area is shit.  Oh, yeah.  So what is the problem?  Yeah.  They're not knocking down houses or existing businesses.  Nothing.  It's just open fields of shit.  Nothingness.  That bitch, Kate Murray, that's just, it's going to create a lot of traffic. 
[01:54:30]  Shut your mouth, bitch.  That place looks like fucking Mogadishu at 12 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, it really does.  Mogadishu.  You can't walk the fucking streets because of that fucking neighborhood.  Yeah.  You go to that goddamn lighthouse, and you make a light rail from the nearest train station,  you're going to call them, you're going to bring fans there, they've got a great  tradition.  You know what, Anthony?  Four in a row.  Do I have a five?  Let's see the Yankees in four in a row first.  Right, well.  Look, if you're trying to compare the Islanders with the Yankees. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, I can't even get behind you on that one, sir.  The Yankees could probably beat the Islanders at hockey.  Oh, that hurts.  I don't give a shit.  I play different sports.  Oh, literal gym.  That hurts.  You're going to have to change the goddamn name.  They can't be called the Islanders.  They're going to call them the New York Queens.  What are they going to be called?  Oh, the New York Queens.  That would be nice.  That sounds a little, uh, gee.  A little gay.  A little gee.  Thank you, Chet.  On Long Island.  How about the New York Happenstances?  Because they're victims of happenstances. 
[01:55:30]  Going to the Haps tonight?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what they'd call them, the Haps.  But there's the Habs.  No, but these are the Happenstances.  It's Haps, not Habs.  Okay.  Would they get confused?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Like, you're going to the Habs?  What?  The Habs or Habs?  Great.  Happenstance.  I come up with great team names.  That would be a great name.  I would love the Happenstances.  What horrible shirts that you'd have to wear with Happenstance on.  It's got the team name and then shrugging shoulders. 
[01:56:00]  That would be horrible.  Shrugging shoulders and his hands are up.  And in between the crook of his thumb, there's a hockey stick.  Yeah, because he's like, huh?  And a puck just floating on the palm of the other one with the hands out.  Yeah.  Huh?  Stick in a puck.  Happenstance.  Happenstance.  Oh, God.  I love it.  Yes.  I say go with it.  The Queen's Happenstances.  Happenstance.  Anthony, by the way, there's a state of the art arena in Kansas City just waiting for the 
[01:56:30]  Islanders to sit.  Oh, is there?  They're just sitting there waiting.  You think they'll go?  What do you call them, though?  You can't call them the Kansas City Islanders.  You think they've changed the name?  That would sound silly.  Actually, I know the name.  Yeah.  Well, I was going to answer this.  Utah Jazz is like the silly one, too.  They were from New Orleans, right?  Well, Los Angeles Lakers is stupid.  Lakers is stupid.  That was, what, Minnesota Lakers or Minneapolis Lakers, whatever the fuck?  Wherever there's lakes.  There were a lot of lakes, and then when they moved them, they decided to keep them as Lakers.  But Utah Jazz is the worst, because there's New Orleans Jazz.  There's a lot of jazz down there, but there's no jazz in Utah.  But now there's a big jazz scene in Utah because of that. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  They built a jazz scene around the name of their team.  Todd?  Yes, Jimmy.  They actually want to call.  They've had a couple of names for Kansas City.  The one that is being bandied about is the Kansas City Tartar Controls.  And do you have an idea for a logo?  Yeah.  It's just two teeth.  One covered in plaque and one shiny with like a little bling. 
[01:57:30]  You're right, right.  The little glimmer.  Showing that it's a job not yet completed.  That's good.  But a hockey stick is cleaning the tartar.  Oh, okay.  I was going to ask, because there's got to be a hockey stick and a puck.  Yeah.  It's knocking puck-shaped tartar off the other two.  How horrible would that be?  It's just big caricature teeth.  Like when they would do a caricature of a Chinese people in 1920.  Carriker.  Carriker.  Yeah.  I like it.  I like Jimmy's ideas for teams. 
[01:58:00]  Let's say hi to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, congratulations, Ope.  Welcome back.  Hey, thanks, Brian.  Thanks.  Do you remember the injustice after paying seven bucks to park in that goddamn parking lot  at the Coliseum of having to drive over the stick that would damage the underside of your car?  Yeah, they have these big sticks like they have to protect the parking lot.  I never got that.  Like the guy said, it's like the soccer stadium everyone went to after fucking Black Hawk Down.  It's like the fucking, it's that one safe sanctuary as you're being chased down fucking Hempstead Turnpike. 
[01:58:30]  Doesn't that stick rip your exhaust and everything else?  It did.  That was my point.  It actually damaged.  I had an old Thunderbird.  It just pulls parts of your car off, man.  Why not?  Then they could sell them.  That's what you get after paying your seven dollars.  You have to leave a piece of your car behind when you're rolling over these fucking sticks.  Yeah.  Someone else said that the NASA Coliseum looks like an old drive-in movie theater.  That's a good one, too.  It is very dated.  It's such a shit hole. 
[01:59:00]  Horrible.  And one more sports call and we'll move on.  Thank you, Brian.  Yes.  Tim in Atlanta, because we should bring this to everyone's attention.  Tim.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi, Tim.  Hey, there was a rumor going around on the internet.  It was all over the place after Game 5.  LeBron seemed really out of it.  He had this really bad game.  And it's out that DeLonte West, the point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron James  found out that DeLonte West was sleeping with LeBron James' mother.  Yeah.  This is a rumor they can't figure out if it's true or not. 
[01:59:30]  Wow.  It's all over the place.  And LeBron James had a horrendous game when he needed to step up his game the most.  Not just a bad game.  I forgot what the stats were.  Ridiculously bad.  So, like, what the fuck?  Obvious of the problem.  Seems like he's a little distracted.  And then it came out that possibly, yeah, this guy, the point guard there, possibly had  an affair with LeBron's mom.  Oh, man.  And then they're saying that's why, you know, when Boston finally knocked him out, that's 
[02:00:00]  why he ripped off the fucking Cavaliers jersey.  Like, I'm done.  Done with this fucking place.  Oh, I need to move on.  So.  All right.  Thanks.  Punch it out.  Yeah, I don't know how true the rumor is, but it's getting around.  He's actually, you know, they think he might go to the Knicks where they're debating.  He said, they said he's debating the Dakota corncubs.  That's where he's debating.  Corncubs?  Yeah.  Or a hockey team?  Yeah.  I mean, wait, basketball.  Yes.  Basketball, yeah.  Basketball. 
[02:00:30]  What league are they in, Jimmy?  Because I don't see them on the...  It's a new team.  The Dakota corncubs.  Are they going to be in the NBA?  No, what they are is, here's the logo.  It's a corncob with a puff of smoke.  It's basketball puffs of smoke.  Oh.  Is there a basket in it?  Yes.  Oh, and are there corncubs sticking out of the basket?  A basketball basket?  That would be nice.  It's a small town and a general store.  It's a very busy logo.  I like it.  You do?  No.  Do you like Chicken Foot? 
[02:01:00]  Fucking hate Chicken Foot.  What a waste of space.  Can we hear another Chicken Foot song?  I'm obsessed with Chicken Foot now.  Yeah, I just happen to have one more.  Oh, please.  It's not the single, right?  No, no, no, no.  No, don't play the single.  No, we don't even have the single.  Yeah, that figures.  We're just doing a shuffle like Ann has to deal with.  Yeah.  This is Sexy Little Thing.  Oh, of course it is.  All right.  Yeah.  It's got to kick in, man.  So far, not bad. 
[02:01:30]  It's just stupid guitar.  Sammy.  When you add a woo to your song, that means you don't have confidence in your own lyrics.  Yep.  His little friend is coming out to play. 
[02:02:00]  Is that his dick?  What's wrong with this, man?  What's the problem with this?  It just sucks.  It's terrible.  It's just, I can't really put my finger on it, but it stinks. 
[02:02:30]  Just listen to it.  Contrived, fucking 80s sounding shit.  Why is it?  Somebody called before and said, this sounds like the music that's playing in every 80s  movie when the bad kids drive up.  It's just horrible.  His little friend comes out to play.  Yeah, his little friend's coming out to play.  Look out.  Sammy, woo.  You hear the woo again?  Woo.  Woo.  He's enjoying it.  Sexy little thing. 
[02:03:00]  Wow.  Oh, the bridge.  Yeah.  Friday night.  He's still, he's fucking 70 years old singing about a Friday night.  What are you doing?  Where are you going, Sammy?  Looks good for his age.  Yeah, he does.  He's always been very nice to us, man.  The red rocker.  Why don't we beat up the ones we love?  I'm the red rocker, Sammy Hagar.  When you have arthritis pain, I take Anacin. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Jump on it.  Jump on it.  Yeah.  Come on.  He's talking to his dick.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Get hard.  Come on.  Get hard.  Well, well.  This song should be called Viagra Boner.  Oh, thanks.  Or not.  Oh, of course.  It's not over.  It gets silent.  Look at the picture Danny found. 
[02:04:00]  He's crazy.  Oh, look.  He's drinking two drinks at a time.  Two tropical drinks.  Yeah.  Well, he's probably in Cabo.  That's where he is.  He's in Cabo.  Awful.  Love, love, love.  Shut up.  His hair like Marion.  Remember Marion?  Is she still alive?  I liked Sammy Hagar for so many years.  I really did.  I liked his solo shit back when MTV was big.  Back in the 80s.  You liked some of the Van Halen or Van Hagar? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, some of it was good.  I kind of liked some.  A lot of it was pussy.  Very dated now.  Pussy Rock.  When you listen to some of that stuff.  Shit like that.  Extremely dated, right?  Yeah.  I just always liked his voice.  But now it's like, all right.  Jesus Christ, we get it.  He's done the same song for fucking 30 years.  Enough already.  Just to finish up the LeBron talk, too.  It should be noted that this guy's right.  Because Chicago's a little mad right now.  The Bulls have a pretty good shot of getting LeBron James.  Oh, do they?  Yeah.  Because he wants to win a championship, too. 
[02:05:00]  And the Bulls are set up nice.  So I think they were saying Bulls, Clippers.  He wants a big market.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Because he wants an empire like Tiger Woods and Jordan and all those guys had.  And I think he's doing very well, obviously, with the endorsements.  But I think it gets even better if you're in a big market, right?  Yeah.  Makes sense.  So it's Bulls, Clippers, Nets, Knicks, and then possibly staying in Cleveland.  Miami's a big... 
[02:05:30]  Miami's on the short list, too?  Yeah, definitely.  Huh.  I didn't know that one.  Isn't LeBron like the only thing Cleveland has?  Yeah.  Isn't it really the only thing they have as far as sports goes?  I know the Cleveland Browns are a very big, popular team with everyone across the country.  They're like America's team when it comes to...  I think there's a LeBron James song that's making the rounds.  Is there?  It's basically saying what you're saying.  Oh, really?  It's the only thing they...  If someone has that, could they send it in to us? 
[02:06:00]  Or that Cleveland song.  That fucking Cleveland song is so funny.  How great is that?  Can we play that again?  Now I just want to hear it.  It's so fucking funny.  The one's better than the other one.  Do you remember, Travis?  There's two of them.  Yeah, the second one's better.  The second one's a little better.  Why don't we go to break with the Cleveland song?  Yeah, let's do that.  I've got to hear those.  What else is going on? 
[02:06:30]  Did Troy and Sean's girlfriend go on that date?  They go on a date?  Explain.  I was lost for a week.  What happened?  Well, you know, our intern, our androgynous intern, Sean, his girlfriend came in with him.  Really?  Yeah.  Hot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sexy?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Hot?  No, she's a sexy girl.  Yeah, she's very sexy.  Would you?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  But she's exotic.  You don't like exotic?  No, no.  She looks very good.  She looks really good.  It doesn't look like crazy exotic or anything like that.  Nice lips?  Yeah, very.  What else is nice?  Nice ass?  Yeah?  Yeah.  She looked good.  Nice ass.  She looked good.  Nice ass.  Thank you, nice lady.  Yeah.  Yeah, she looked good.  So, he was, you know, of course, whining and pouting and doing what he fucking does,  little emo shit.  And then a real man. 
[02:07:30]  Slow down.  Hold on.  Yeah?  I mean, no meal, but you're not a fan of the emo shit.  Why aren't you a fan, though?  Oh, so...  Because it's fake emotion, right?  Everything's so deep and troubling.  You know what it is?  It's not even that it's fake emotion.  It's just, it seems like emo people, they act out what they think that they're supposed  to be feeling, right?  Right.  It's not a real emotion.  That's what I mean.  Fake emotion.  Yeah, but they're not fake.  I think they feel it because I think they think that they're supposed to feel that way, 
[02:08:00]  so they do it.  They don't know what they're feeling.  That's why I hate emo people.  Yeah.  I fucking hate emo people.  I think they're not sad, but they think they're supposed to be sad because maybe something  sad happened, and they go, oh, I think I'm supposed to be sad, and then they act sad.  And I enjoy a Cure song every once in a while, but I hate emo people.  I enjoy a little more see every once in a while.  A little bit.  A little bit.  But I don't know.  I fucking hate emos.  You just gotta swish your hair down in front of your eyes so no one can see your pain.  You don't think they're really sad?  Oh, don't look at my pained eyes. 
[02:08:30]  They're hiding bad hairlines.  That's what most emo people are.  They're going bald.  They had fucking horrible hairlines.  They comb their shitty hair over to their eyes.  You don't think they have a clue on their emotions?  No, they don't know.  They're just all sad, so they have to show the pain through piercings and fucking hairstyles.  Now, Danny's showing you an emo kid.  What is that kid thinking right now?  Help me.  I'm troubled.  I was made fun of my whole life for being overweight, so I just took that pain and anguish and focused 
[02:09:00]  it within me, and it came out in my art and poetry and my piercings.  I think emo...  She's a faggot.  Emo's kind of like a...  You suck it up.  I guess it's kind of like a new thing.  I mean, it's not new, but I guess this version of emo is a new thing.  I think it evolved out of club kids.  Yeah, but I think also there was some kind of, like, the crow thing happening, too, because  I went to high school with this black kid who thought he wasn't...  Boo! 
[02:09:30]  You were poor.  Boo!  He thought he was the crow.  He would show up with the crow makeup, and, like, his big thing was he would wear...  He would always wear a hood and hockey gloves, and that was, like, his thing.  What an asshole.  I know.  But I think he was my...  Like, my generation's emo kid.  Like, if you were into the crow and you did, like, the black eyeliner, like, that was...  Right, right.  Guys putting makeup on.  That was emo.  And shit is all emo. 
[02:10:00]  And, like, the long black leather trench coats.  Do you think teachers have to watch the emo kids closely to make sure they don't commit  suicide during school hours?  Yeah, I'm sure the teachers and staff have to fucking waste their time making dossiers  on each and every one of these dummies.  Do you think there's a high alert when the emo kids are walking around the halls of the  school?  Um, hi.  Hi, Mrs. Johnson?  Uh, yeah.  Well, your son, um, we pulled him out of class, it seems...  I hate to tell you this, but do you know he's cutting? 
[02:10:30]  No, not class.  His arms.  Yeah, in class.  It's very emo-tional.  So, what should I do about it?  Well, we're sending him to counseling, and, um, I'm sure it won't work.  We're gonna get him a barber.  Shave his fucking...  I hate them.  Anyway, sorry.  They're so pained.  Oh!  What?  They're just expressing the depth of their hurt.  They could hang out together and just commiserate? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Just commiserate?  Did they ever laugh when they're together?  A hearty...  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  I don't think so.  What's their laugh about?  They don't know that emotion either.  So, Sean...  And they come from wealthy families, too.  Just stop it.  They actually have it pretty easy.  Oh, of course they do.  So, Sean is one of these guys.  Yeah, yeah.  One of these emo kids.  Yeah, he's emo.  And his girlfriend, we've...  And his girlfriend is, uh, hot.  He doesn't deserve her.  She seems like she wants things. 
[02:11:30]  He doesn't like going down on her.  He said it.  She loves having, uh, people go down on her.  She was with the Asian guy who went down on her, and she came in his mouth.  Oh, boy, did we make her fucking go through that line by line while he...  Oh, I know.  Well, he kind of stood there balancing, like, on one foot.  Yeah.  Just kind of, like, leaning ahead.  Emo people always have, like, the weight shifted to one side more than the other.  The pain on the left.  They gotta, like, cock one leg out, and, like, put the other one in the hip is out, and just  stand like an emo, because they gotta be in pain. 
[02:12:00]  She said that?  Yeah, yeah.  She, she...  So, the Chinese guy she was with had a real small dick.  Go figure that one out.  Yeah.  And, uh, but he went down on her and made her cum.  Wow.  And that was freaking him out.  I kept saying cum in his mouth.  Yeah.  Because I knew that would fucking really bug Sweetie Pants.  Yep.  Him in his fucking tight little jeans.  His tempting jeans.  Yes.  Who are we all kidding?  And, uh, well, we invited in a real man. 
[02:12:30]  Somebody who she's communicated with on, uh, Facebook and whatnot.  Uh, that's right.  Elena Kagan.  Oh.  Gee, thanks.  Nice one, Dan.  Is that a tattoo on his arm?  Does he have a tattoo on his dick?  Is that an emo kid with a hard-on?  You know, knowing our, our ex-intern, Sean.  He probably just drew some stuff on there with a fucking pen.  Oh, drew something on him?  Yeah, that's, that's great.  Thanks.  So, uh...  Uh, so we invited a real man in.  Troy, can we go get the real man?  Oh, Troy's the real man.  Troy's the real man.  Troy's the real man. 
[02:13:00]  And she, uh...  What?  Oh, she was going after, like, Troy, loving the tats, loving the, you know, the man kind  of thing going on with him, as opposed to the fucking fairy emo-ish Sean thing.  And, uh, so we, we made them kind of wanted to see what they looked like as a couple, so  we made them hug, and then we made them, uh, kiss.  Nice.  Right in front of Sean, who was devastated, just sitting there like an idiot.  How would, how would you feel if this fucking animal was kissing your chick? 
[02:13:30]  I'd have a rod and be heartbroken.  But fucking, uh, and then all he wanted to do was he wanted a little affection from fucking  Sam.  Oh, my God.  Sam was not being cooperative.  I know.  Sam, why?  What's wrong with you?  I'm not gonna...  What's wrong with you all of a sudden?  I know.  He's changing.  You've kissed three guys.  Kissed homeless people and random men.  He doesn't like whites.  That's what it is.  A fourth...  What's a fourth guy gonna do?  It's gonna make it four.  You've already got three under your belt.  Three is too many as it is.  And all we wanted was a shirtless hug.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you? 
[02:14:00]  Which leads to other things.  A shirtless hug.  And, uh, you wouldn't do it.  Jesus.  So, finally, I mean, I really had to get on him.  I had to pull some authority on him.  Nice.  To make him hug.  But he did the, the real hard back slapping hug.  Like, hey, well, Ralph, how are you doing?  One of those hugs.  No, but Sam likes it when you tell him what to do like that.  Like, when you, when you fucking snapped at him.  I had to snap.  And you put on the fucking, the dominating voice.  He fucking piped right up and went over and did as he was told. 
[02:14:30]  I think he does like that shit.  What is Denny doing?  Denny's just scrolling through nude emo guy dick pictures.  What is wrong with him?  I must say, they're really funny.  The one where the kids in the library with the fucking picture.  Gay emo.  Gay emo.  That's pretty funny.  But the thing that really hurt Sean, too, was that when you told Kat and Troy to kiss each other.  Yeah.  You told them to do a closed mouth, just like in the movies, with your lips closed. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  And Kat leaned up to Troy, lips wide open, ready for a big open mouth kiss.  She looked like she was yawning.  Yeah.  Couldn't wait to get a fucking man's lips on hers.  A real man.  Right.  So, um, I decided that it was probably a good idea to hook these two kids up.  Good boy.  For the weekend.  Maybe go out to dinner.  Good boy.  Hang out.  And, uh, see what, just see what happens.  Right.  So, um, I, I didn't hear of anything.  Did, uh, Troy, did, did you go out with her? 
[02:15:30]  Well, first of all, you're very kind.  And he threw me a couple bucks to take her out.  Yeah, you know, I figured, what the hell?  And I tried to give it back at the end of the show.  He's like, no, go ahead.  No, no.  Three hundred clams.  Wow.  That's right.  Well, you know, I wanted it to be a nice dinner.  You know, that'll buy a lot of shrimp.  Impress.  Get that girl some shrimps.  Get some shrimps.  Maybe let her get her herded.  Did she get her herded?  So, what, uh, what, anything transpired?  So, I hit her up on Facebook, and I just said, hey, you know, we're supposed to go out.  I got the money.  I'd like to take you out, but.  Let's make believe it's for the show.  I want to make sure Sean's cool with it. 
[02:16:00]  Because Sean's a little weird.  You know, and I just didn't need him killing himself or doing something stupid over this  You cock-blocked yourself.  No, I was just trying to, like, cover my bases.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I gotcha.  If he's going to kill himself, he's going to kill himself.  That's my logic.  You don't need a suicide.  I don't need that on me.  You know what I mean?  Like, if you're going to do it, go ahead, but I don't want it to be as a result of something  I did.  Yeah, but he could kill himself because it's raining.  You could explain away anything, really.  You could just go, ah, he killed himself because.  Yeah, look at him.  He should have.  Yeah, he should have. 
[02:16:30]  Pants are too tight.  Yeah, she was like, yeah, he said it's cool.  He came over and said, yeah, yeah, go ahead.  Take her out.  Blessing, nice.  I was like, okay, so we'll hook up Saturday.  So she lives a block from me, which is a little weird.  Oh, damn.  And where does Sean live?  They live together?  They live together.  A block away from you?  A block away.  They're living together.  I'm living with my ex-girlfriend, so it's just this really bizarre.  It's a sitcom.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah.  And meanwhile, my ex-girlfriend, I helped her get ready for her date.  She had a guy coming over to the apartment, so it was a whole weird. 
[02:17:00]  What?  Wow, that is odd.  How did you deal with that?  How did you help her?  She was cooking dinner.  I just helped her get some things together and helped her clean the apartment.  You didn't mind?  Wait, you had to leave your own place because your ex-girlfriend?  Well, I was going out anyway.  So she's like, I'm going to have a date over to cook dinner.  How did I do this?  How did I do this?  I'd be out of my mind.  I mean, you have to be really mature about it.  You have to say, all right, cool.  You know, we're not together anymore.  We're cool as people.  You know, good luck with everything you do.  You're crazy.  Yeah, man.  I mean, if you could get past that point and, you know, not think about them as a girlfriend 
[02:17:30]  anymore, then I guess, you know.  So you helped her get the apartment ready.  It's Jerry and Elaine.  So she could have a guy over that she was cooking dinner for that she would probably,  probably would.  Possibly, sure.  And that doesn't bother you?  It has to on some level.  Not really.  Even if you're done with the person.  Well, it's like when you're locked into a lease with somebody, there's really not much  you can do.  So we have to be there together.  So we're just like, you know, good luck.  You can be mature about it or you can be a fucking asshole and, you know, make her life 
[02:18:00]  miserable and she'll make your life miserable.  Do you still get Jimmy's nodding his head?  Yep.  That's the route I would go.  That's it.  Yeah.  Do you still get benefits?  No.  No more benefits?  No.  We cut that off.  He should have bought some Valtrex and left them on the counter so the guy saw it.  Yeah, I mean, when you do something like that, you're just, you're mixing weird emotions.  You know what I mean?  You're living with somebody, she's dating somebody else, so that's probably just not a good idea.  Wow.  But, um, so I hit Cat up and...  Oh, good news.  Danny found a site called Gay Emo Boys, so now we don't have to really search. 
[02:18:30]  Found it.  I linked it from my Twitter.  Oh, okay.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus, Danny.  I think he dives his hair black, that kid.  Anyway, so you're living with your ex.  Sean's with this girl that's getting a little weird.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I just wanted to make sure everything was cool.  So I met up with her and, uh, we went out to this restaurant.  She had a great time.  Was it nice?  A nice place?  It was great.  I took her where the real players go.  All right.  The Brazilian steakhouse. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  49.  Very good.  So, uh, she had a great time.  She said she wanted South American, so we went with that and that was, uh, she had a  great time.  Great conversation.  What position is that?  So you're, give me South American.  All right.  Flip over.  Yes.  That's an, that's a, that's a good rogering while my boyfriend cries.  Roger.  But, uh, yeah.  Really good conversation.  Had a good time.  Uh, I've got to.  Did you finger her under the, under the table or?  No.  No, I did not, unfortunately.  Oh, the tittle.  But, uh, just went into, like, uh, the relationship with Sean and he's got this really bizarre 
[02:19:30]  fascination with me.  He thinks that we're linked together in, in different ways.  We're both from Allentown, Pennsylvania.  We both live in the same neighborhood.  Close in all the factories.  He went through all of these, these different ways that we're connected with each other.  And it kind of freaked me out a little bit.  Well, how long have you been out of Allentown?  For, uh, four years.  This is not going to end with a murder-suicide.  No, this is good.  Wow.  So that's why I'm just kind of freaked out.  You know what I mean?  We're, he's, he's telling her we have these weird connections and just kind of freaked 
[02:20:00]  out at this point.  But, you know, we had a good time regardless.  Connection.  So, you, you go out, uh, with, did she, uh, did she eat, like, sloppily or anything?  I like, I like how, you know, you got to look at a girl and see how she, how she handles  herself eating.  Was she shoveling food in her mouth?  Like, if she takes sausages eight at a time and just swallows them whole.  Yeah.  She's a good girl.  Pushes the back of her head down on her food.  Yeah, she leaves egg salad on her lips.  No, you know, she was trying to eat real proper.  We both were like, ah, fuck it. 
[02:20:30]  And then we started, you know, they have like onion rings and french fries.  Well, that's cool.  So you got comfortable with each other pretty quickly.  Right.  Uh, you're, you're having, ah, yes, Sam.  And Troy said that he found out at dinner that she plays the drums, as does he.  Wow.  So we already have things in common.  Yeah.  So you have some things in common musically.  Yeah, we hit off really well.  Yeah, she's a cool chick.  Yeah, that sounds, uh, that sounds pretty cool.  And now, now the problem is your, your ex was having a guy over the house.  Yes.  So now you had no place to go.  Well, we'll, we'll, we'll get there.  Hang on a second. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yes.  There you go.  Troy's coming there.  Let's see.  That means he's got confidence in, in what he's got to tell us today.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I respect that.  So, uh, had a couple, she's under 21.  She's only 20.  Yeah.  So it really slings down what you can do.  You know what I mean?  Does it really?  Because to go anywhere in this, well, to go anywhere in the city, cool, you got to be 21.  So I had a couple other options and, uh, we decided to head over to the blue note, it's  a jazz club downtown and, uh, watched a band play. 
[02:21:30]  We were there.  Scooby-wa.  Yeah.  It was cool.  It was like a, like a jazz funk band.  It was fun.  Yeah.  So she's into that kind of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had like a real kind of hipster night out.  A gentleman evening.  That's like a gentleman taking a girl.  Hey, you know, like here's a girl 20 years old, used to Sean taking her out to fucking  Friendly's.  Friendly's.  Well, well, well, and, and, yeah.  I know where you're going and I, I, Jimmy, would, if you went out with her, where would  you have taken her?  To dinner?  You know, I know the restaurant he went to. 
[02:22:00]  That's a good place.  Yeah.  But would you do the same?  Nah, I would have my dick out, like right after dinner and I would probably wreck it.  But he's, Troy's a smart guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You make it a whole evening.  You go out for some whatever and this way.  You wouldn't have, you wouldn't have patience to make it a whole evening.  I would wreck it.  That's what I'm saying.  I would wreck it.  Yeah.  I would literally just go, how fat you're pussy.  And she would get up and leave.  I would ruin it.  It's, uh.  He's got patience.  Yes.  But he's a, he's a smart guy because 20 year old girl now, he's showing her the type  of time a lady would have. 
[02:22:30]  A girl like that is, is looked at not just as some 20 year old girl with a guy that doesn't  fucking know what the fuck he's doing.  That's the point.  Is stupid Sean takes it to Friendly's.  He takes it to a nice restaurant and then a jazz club.  Um, that's a night out on the town city.  Are you, are you broke now, Troy?  Cause this place doesn't pay you shit.  No.  I mean, luckily Anthony helped me out with that.  Oh, that's right.  All right.  Oh, I, I was definitely, I was taking care of this.  I forgot about the 300.  Anything to grind it into Sean's fucking craw. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  That was really cool.  I really appreciate it.  No problem.  I, I, please.  I hope you had a great time.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  We were there till about, um, like two 33 o'clock in the morning.  Wow.  That's a pretty late night out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, um, afterward I texted my ex-girlfriend and I said, Hey, are you at the apartment?  Because she said she was going to have dinner and go out.  And, you know, we were at the club, you know, she's getting a little bit closer.  You know, there was some body language, you know, I was picking up some vibes. 
[02:23:30]  And, uh, so I was like, Hey.  Is your penis standing up like your hairdo is?  Uh, kind of.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of, you know, you start thinking.  You want to go home, right?  Right.  Well, I was like, so what do you want to do?  She's like, well, I don't know if I really want to go home.  She's saying this at three in the morning?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's good.  Wow.  Damn.  Why would she want to go home to that fucking nothing? 
[02:24:00]  There's a suicidal femme on her sofa.  A femme.  There's a fucking, there's an androgynous thing with a razor at its wrists.  There's a, there's a man with real tattoos, not the ones that Sean just wrote on him.  And then some emo, yeah, some emo kid laying there.  If they find my body, tie a ribbon on his wrist.  Okay.  He's got real tats.  Of course.  He's full of cock.  She doesn't want to go home at three.  Right.  If that's not a sign.  Okay.  So I texted my ex-girlfriend.  I'm like, hey, did you go out? 
[02:24:30]  She's like, no, I'm still at the apartment.  Oh.  I mean, she was getting it on.  And I'm like.  Oh, God.  She's like, sorry about the pillowcase.  Exactly.  So, yeah, that was kind of it.  So we just walked over to Union Square.  There was a couple of kids skating there.  We were watching them skate and we were just talking.  That's all we pretty much did.  And then we head back uptown.  We both live on the Upper East Side.  So I walked her home and.  What a guy.  I did my best to be as good of a gentleman as I possibly could be.  Any just little kiss goodnight? 
[02:25:00]  It was a kiss on the cheek.  A little hug and kiss kind of thing.  Yeah, man.  I wanted to just take it easy.  I wasn't trying to.  That's how.  That's.  You know, I'm trying to conquer a lot of ground.  Nothing wrong with that.  As long as.  Will there be another date, you think?  I said I would actually hang out with her again.  Yeah.  And she.  She was kind of cool with that.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes.  And Samuel.  Let the record state.  And it should be said to Sean when he gets back.  Troy texted his girlfriend or ex-girlfriend.  Sorry, Troy.  To see if she was still at the apartment. 
[02:25:30]  If she had said, no, I'm not at the apartment, they would have gone back to the apartment.  I probably would have fucked her.  Honestly.  That's okay.  Wait, wait.  What did he just say?  Oh, ho, ho.  I mean, that's what was going through my head.  You would definitely fucked her?  If his chick wasn't home, he would have fucked her.  It just, she, you know, some of her body language and some of the things she would say.  You would at least lick her dirty asshole, right?  Oh, she wants that, too.  I know she does.  She likes her ass licked, and stupid Sean won't go anywhere near it.  Right.  What the hell, dude?  Yeah.  So, it was probably a good thing, because I might have done something I would have felt 
[02:26:00]  great about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of those, like, after you nut, you're like, oh, why did I do that?  Oh, why did I have sex with a 20-year-old girl?  No, it's not that.  That's not what I'm worried about.  I'm worried about getting shot in the back of my head as I walk out of my apartment,  you know, from her ex-boyfriend, so.  The only thing he wants to shoot on you is his cum.  He really thinks you guys are linked?  That's a little weird.  Yeah, well, he went down all these, you know, from Allentown, Upper East Side, just all these 
[02:26:30]  different connections that we have.  I bet he wants to hug you and, like, kind of, like, have one hand around your neck and  one around your waist and, like, kind of look up at you and have you just talk to him  and tell him things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, she really thinks he's gay.  I mean, there's no...  Oh, you guys talked about it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he always gawks at these guys' Facebook photos and...  What the fuck?  She...  Yeah, she knows he's gay.  Yes.  Yeah, he probably is.  That's what she...  Everybody knows he's gay. 
[02:27:00]  Her parents know he's gay.  Wow.  He doesn't think he's gay.  He knows he's gay.  He's fighting it.  He's fighting it, yeah.  He's really fighting it.  He comes from a very religious, conservative family.  Yeah, I'll say.  Yeah.  So they'll fight it to the bitter end.  How was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How was your day with Sean while Troy was out with his...  I didn't go out with Sean.  I was...  I heard...  For the record...  I heard...  Saturday night, I was here doing a radio show.  Are you sure?  It's on record.  Was it an early date, then?  It was.  There was no early date.  I was at a pro wrestling convention before then, so I have alibis.  Mm-hmm.  I did not see Sean. 
[02:27:30]  I did not.  Sam's afraid that Sean could make him turn, because Sean would show you such a tenderness.  Is that true, Sam?  I'm not afraid that...  I'm afraid that I would turn Sean.  No.  I don't need...  I don't need...  Real...  I think...  Sexualness to be confused with this.  You two probably would hit it off sexually.  You think I would just...  A couple of beers...  Give it all up.  ...be all it would take.  Once you at least give it a try.  Come on.  Exactly.  Is that why you don't drink, Sam?  Because you're afraid of what would happen?  That's it.  Just a couple of beers in.  A couple of beers in, and he'd be all over the cock. 
[02:28:00]  No.  Sam would be loving the cock after two beers.  You'd think after two beers, it's sloppy...  Two fucking beers.  Sloppy party bottom time for Sam.  Two beers, and Sam would just be like, I don't know why I just didn't grab...  I love the cock.  He would make this noise while he sucked it.  He would take the cock in his mouth and put his tongue under the balls and go...  Hey, Tommy from Brooklyn has a good... 
[02:28:30]  We don't have to go to the phone.  Very good question, though, Troy.  Oh, wait.  You only have one bedroom?  Yeah.  One bedroom.  Oh.  Because he's wondering why he didn't just go back there with her anyway and find some  kind of place to go.  So now...  You must have a real small place.  You and your ex are in one bedroom?  Yeah.  One bed?  Yes.  So what?  You don't do anything anymore?  No.  Now, if she's having sex in that bed, dude...  I mean, we have an understanding that...  She's not going to have the sex on her side of the bed, so keep that nice and fresh. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  Like, not in the bed.  You know.  So wait.  Did you get back with your ex, or no?  There's no chance.  No, we're done.  Okay.  Now, we've done five years together.  You ever see his ex?  She's beautiful.  She's very nice, though.  Beautiful.  Now, at the end of the night, you just hop in bed with your ex after her date and your  date?  Yeah.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Do you smell anything under the covers, like sex?  No.  Does she sleep dressed?  Sometimes.  Sometimes she sleeps in her panties.  Panties? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Do you ever wake up and find that you're, like, draped around her just in the middle of  the night?  You kind of...  We first decided to call it off.  She would try to snuggle, try to get close.  Like, you know how girls back their ass up against you?  Yeah.  How great is that?  I want you to push into it.  How great is that?  I would be like...  Jimmy, give me away.  Wow.  Push her away, huh?  How great is that?  You want to make sure you want to smell the sheets, though, when you come home.  There's been a date.  Like, you don't want to smell...  God forbid you smell like cocoa butter and see a very curly pubic hair.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:30:00]  No.  The radio's on BLS.  Slow jams.  There's a couple of instant feedbacks coming in about Sam, by the way.  Yeah.  This is Phil Snow from Rochester.  By wrestling event, he meant Sean pinning him face down to a mat.  Okay.  I haven't spoken to Sean.  And Dogshit Sniffer writes, two beers and Sam is praying toward Mecca with his ass in the air.  I really think if you got a buzz on, you would be such a different person, especially with someone like Sean. 
[02:30:30]  He would take that whole cock in his mouth and do the thing where the cock snakes out and washes the cock.  Sam's the kind of kid that he would take a soft cock in his mouth and he wants to feel it get hard in his mouth.  Wow.  What do you think about that, Sam?  I've never even thought about that.  But honestly, Danny, I mean, a lot of us would be guilty of that.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  True.  I want to kiss more guys.  I'm very confident in my heterosexuality.  Soft cock.  Are you?  Very confident.  Bulge your cheek out like a little chipmunk.  You never had the wake-up blowjob?  Pop it out of his cheek.  Yeah.  See, Sam would hold the shaft to make it more turgid.  Stop knocking your coffee over.  Fucking Danny's.  Danny's all excited.  He's getting turned on.  Look at Danny over there.  Somebody's spilling a bunch of coffee to this story.  You spilled my coffee. 
[02:31:30]  You fucking fag.  I'm sorry, sir.  Beat the shit out of her.  Greatest PSA ever?  Oh, yes.  Anyway.  From Canada.  So where are we at?  Sam popping the coffee.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  Sam squeezing the bass.  Like, Sam's hand would be in the pubes.  And he'd be popping.  Sam's noisy.  Oh, Sam.  Because he's all drunk.  He's a sloppy sucker.  He's all drunk. 
[02:32:00]  I never realized.  I have never had a homosexual experience, nor have I ever had the desire to have one.  But you kissed three guys.  Explain that.  That was for comedy and for radio and television.  What about the dildo that looked like a penis?  For radio.  Ah, right.  That was for radio.  You can't take the Bobo defense on all these things.  For the bit.  I do it for the show.  Show.  Loyalty.  It's a bid.  What did you tell me Bobo said during Cherry Darts?  When the girl...  It was pretty funny.  We were asking Bobo what he would do with her.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  At first he said that he would eat her pussy, I think, through her panties.  Right.  Yeah.  And then I think somebody said, well, what if you couldn't do that?  What if she didn't like that?  Like, what's something else that you would do?  And then he just goes, well, fuck her in the ass.  Fuck her in the ass.  She's not going to allow you to do the first thing.  She's not going to allow him to go down on her through the panties.  So then number two is fucking her in the ass.  Yeah.  He really knows how to line that up.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  So you're going to definitely go back out with Sean's girl? 
[02:33:00]  I said yes.  Do you have an attraction to her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  More so now that I hung out with her.  Yeah.  She's cool.  She seems cool.  She's a very nice person.  She's real into music and definitely cool to just hang with.  And anyone talk to Sean after this whole thing?  Why are you looking at me?  Because you're the gay guy.  No, I'm not.  You're in touch with me.  Did someone call me?  Did Sean hug you at all?  Like, you know, whisper in the ear, thank God for you.  No.  I never said that. 
[02:33:30]  He did tell me that he was turned off.  That I was aggressive when I hugged him as if to say, you were.  You weren't tender and sweet.  No.  You were patting him.  You were slapping him on the back.  He wants your love, Sam.  I know, but he's not going to get it.  When's Sean in the next?  Tomorrow?  No, he's not until the end of the week.  He wants your sex.  He wants your sex.  Apparently.  Yeah.  Give it to him.  Never going to get it.  We're going to sing songs.  That's the song I'm going to sing.  A few beers.  It's in vogue. 
[02:34:00]  Exactly.  A few beers.  One bourbon, one scotch, one beer.  Yeah.  Then I'll just go into a gangster fag song.  It doesn't help his case that he just sang in vogue, though.  I mean, in vogue is a popular group.  That's a little rough.  That's a popular group.  Well, it's not anymore, but they were very popular for their time.  Yeah.  I guess we'll get Sean's side of this story at the end of the week.  Yeah.  I think he might be done, actually.  What?  Hopefully.  I think he's done.  I think he's done his internship.  Hopefully you stop.  Is he done with his internship?  I think so.  How come there wasn't a big farewell, far thee well?  Because we finally gave up on interns.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  It was depressing to see Newt have to say goodbye to people every three months.  So now we don't really acknowledge them.  It's easier that way.  If Sean's done, we can still get him back in for his side of the story.  It's like one of those movies where the white teacher comes in and teaches the black kids,  and they finally behave and learn, and then she has to send them off into the world.  It's very sad.  Love Buzz has been here for a full semester and still has not figured out how to get  coffee or soda pop.  Love Buzz is a blithering idiot.  He really is a moron. 
[02:35:00]  He may be the stupid, not the worst, but the stupidest intern that we've ever had.  Give me your top five stupidest interns.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Ricky was kind of dumb.  Ricky was retarded.  Ricky.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Why are we calling Ricky retardo?  Yeah.  What?  But you've got to explain why Ricky, because that goes back too long.  I remember there was a classic story about Ricky was supposed to get everybody's breakfast  one morning, and he was gone for a real long time. 
[02:35:30]  And I think about after an hour, we're like, where are you?  And he's like, well, I'm still looking.  He goes, it's the Blue Awning, right?  And we're like, yeah, it's a place with the Blue Awning.  And he goes, oh, it has a Blue Awning?  And we're like, yeah.  He goes, oh, and he's like, I thought that was the name of the place.  Like, he thought there was some breakfast place called the Blue Awning that he was looking  for.  So he made the top five?  Oh, for sure.  I think Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie Jones is still there.  This is why Cream Pie Jones is so stupid.  Because he held my shit and waved at his head. 
[02:36:00]  Exactly.  Wore a duty hat.  A duty hat.  He put shit in his hair, yeah.  For a free bit.  He comes in.  Cream Pie was great.  He didn't even get lunch for that.  Oh, okay.  Apparently somebody's been saving pictures.  It's the Sam sucking a dick picture.  You're good.  That's obviously fake.  You can tell in that picture.  Look at your mouth, fucking.  You can really suck a big dick.  Yeah, Sam.  Here's what Sam does right.  Sam keeps his eyes open, which is a little creepy. 
[02:36:30]  But he puffs his cheek.  He's really sucking.  Because Sam wants to pull that cum out.  Sam's goal is to one day pull the cum out before his nose hits the belly button.  That's what he said someday in high school he was going to do.  I'll learn to pull the cum out before my nose hits the belly button.  Was that in your yearbook, Sam?  No, it wasn't in my yearbook.  They wouldn't allow that language.  All right.  So we got two.  We got a wise cream pie.  Oh, right.  Because he's in town.  And he comes in to do stuff on the Saturday show. 
[02:37:00]  And I've told him, come by and visit Opie and Anthony's show.  You want a career in radio?  Do a couple bits for O&A?  He said no.  Because he thinks that you guys will make him do crazy things.  And then he won't get a job in radio.  Oh, he wants to go legit?  Yeah.  Didn't cream pie say that the reason he can't get a job?  Yes.  Yes.  He thinks that the reason that he has not landed a job in radio...  He's blaming us?  ...is because he's sure that his potential employers have searched out the Big Boy Made  a Duty series.  Now, the only way you can find those videos is if you Google Cream Pie Jones or Big Boy 
[02:37:30]  Made a Duty.  Who doesn't Google that?  Neither of those two things, I'm assuming, are on his resume.  Holy shit.  He actually is saying this?  He absolutely said that to me.  The interning on our show was detrimental.  Yes.  Wow, that's a good one.  Look at how...  I'm looking at a picture now, and Sam has the head of a dick in his mouth.  No, no, no.  That's fake.  That's a...  And he knows how to not give teeth.  That stupid hairdo.  He looks like Montgomery from Fame. 
[02:38:00]  The fucking...  Montgomery.  The gay guy who was the love of this therapist.  The listeners maybe get...  It's a dildo.  You phrased the...  You said dick.  This proves that Cream Pie Jones' point is wrong, because...  After you did this fine video...  I got two other shows.  Exactly.  So you got two other shows.  Yes.  In radio.  Yeah.  You're the only guy around here that has three radio shows.  Right.  Big boy made a dirty.  Ronnie B's got three radio shows.  I thought he had two.  So did Jim Norton.  Does he officially have three? 
[02:38:30]  I thought it was three.  Oh, all right.  Then it's you and Ronnie B.  And Jimmy's got three?  I do.  You have two.  Three.  Two.  Cranky Bra was pretty stupid.  Here's Cream Pie.  Cranky Bra.  Cranky Bra's making it in the biz.  Here's Cream Pie, everyone.  We're the best by.  Cream Pie!  How is everyone doing?  Hi, Cream Pie.  Now, we're learning a little something about you.  Want to take this?  Cream Pie.  First of all, could you just give your big catchphrase first?  I want to hear it.  Can you say, big boy made a duty? 
[02:39:00]  Big boy made a duty.  Oh, so much for getting a job in radio.  That's not how you use it.  No, you made it a duty.  Your voice changed or something.  What happened?  Do it with the enthusiasm.  It's been like three years when I just woke up.  Exactly.  Well, give it a try.  One more.  Dig deep.  Give it some enthusiasm.  Big boy made a duty.  No, wait.  That's not good enough either because I think the line actually is, oh boy.  Oh boy.  Isn't it oh boy?  Oh boy.  And then big boy made a duty.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't even know. 
[02:39:30]  No, it's a question.  Did big boy made a duty?  Ah, you're right.  Big boy did make a duty.  Big boy did make a duty.  Why does you sound like Herman Munster?  I know.  Big boy did make a duty, Lily.  Grandpa.  Grandpa, big boy made a duty.  Eddie.  Eddie, you've made a duty.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Cream Pie.  Yes.  Now, we hear tell that you want to actually get a job in the radio business. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And that you've been going out on interviews or at least sending out resumes and whatnot?  I stopped doing that for a while, man.  Way to stick with you.  All right.  Yeah, good.  That'll get you a job.  Go-to-itiveness.  Yeah, stick-to-itiveness, actually.  Oh.  He's a go-to guy.  All right.  That works.  Now, Cream Pie, we just heard that you are under the impression,  that interning on this program, and more specifically, doing the Big Boy Made a Duty series, 
[02:40:30]  has kept you from getting a job in radio.  Um, yes.  Yes.  So you have said this, and you believe it.  Partially, yes.  Now, why would you think that, in your own words here?  Because I played with shit.  Yeah.  But Danny brought up a good point.  Do you think potential employers are going to Google Big Boy Made a Duty and find you? 
[02:41:00]  They Google, like, Jared and Opie and Anthony show, or something like that.  They wouldn't find it.  They wouldn't find it under that.  It's just under Cream Pie Jones, your professional name.  And Big Boy Made a Duty.  We'll check Jared, Opie, and Anthony.  Jared videos.  Let's see.  See, all you get is Jared's pube mustache.  Well, I don't think that's going to help his cause, either.  Oh, my bad. 
[02:41:30]  Jared's pube mustache.  I think I'm the only one in the room that has to side with Cream Pie.  I think the kid might have a bit of a point.  Oh, you do find it.  Oh, wait, it's all there.  It is the first result.  Every video is there.  Yeah.  Big Boy Finds a Duty Hat.  Big Boy Finds a Duty Hat.  Big Boy Made a Duty.  Uh, yeah, Cream Pie Jones.  Wasn't it a trilogy?  Can we hear Big Boy Made a Duty?  I want to hear his enthusiasm.  Wasn't it a trilogy, though?  Didn't he make three? 
[02:42:00]  I think there was at least one more.  Third one wasn't as good as the first one.  Yeah, it kind of jumped the septic tank.  Oh, this is the second one?  I want to see.  That's Big Boy Finds a Duty Hat.  Yeah, I'll get it real quick.  Where's the first one, Daniel?  The first one was epic.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So, Cream Pie, apparently you are up there.  So, and you think employers are Googling your name and finding these videos and saying no?  Wait, let's play the whole audio.  Hold on, Cream Pie.  Let's give a listen. 
[02:42:30]  One of my favorite videos that a lot of people still don't know about.  The wonderfulness that is, Big Boy Makes a Duty.  And apparently if you want to find it, all you have to do is Google Jared, Opie, and Anthony.  Yeah.  I know, I thought it was so much harder to find.  But people, it's, I get psyched, but I see Big Boy Finds a Duty Hat.  Yeah, that's the second one.  And that's the second one.  Not as good as Big Boy.  Nah.  And by the way, Jared got paid money to do this. 
[02:43:00]  How much?  How much?  Jared?  Jared?  All together, I think it was like $7,900.  Yeah, there you go.  You should have fucking saved your money.  $2,900 from us.  Yeah, really.  All right, let's.  Here it is.  Love the music.  The worst shit in a bowl, by the way, we're looking at.  Welcome.  Hey, Jimmy, what happened in there?  Big Boy Made a Duty.  Did someone say Big Boy Made a Duty? 
[02:43:30]  Did someone say Big Boy Made a Duty?  He's reaching into the toilet.  He's lifting up Jimmy's poo.  Big Boy Sure Did Make a Duty.  Puts a tiny little doody hat on it.  Bye-bye.  Ways goodbye to him.  Bye-bye.  He's waving with a shit-stained hand.  He put a doody hat on it.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha. 
[02:44:00]  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Give me $20.  And he's wearing a doody hat.  Do you know how bad that looks to a potential boss?  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  It looks like one of those, like a little paper boat, and it says doody hat on it.  Yeah, it's a paper boat hat that you wear upside down on your head.  It has a big doody hat.  It's a doody hat.  What the fuck you want from us?  Grow a mustache and go on an interview.  Yeah.  Give him a different name.  Exactly.  A different name and a different look. 
[02:44:30]  You'll be fine.  Yes.  Holy shit.  Oh, is that funny.  Has anyone...  How do you...  Do you know for sure that you've ever been turned down because of this?  Oh, I don't know for sure, but it just...  Yeah, because your radio skills are amazing, so it could be that.  Make up something less damaging about your radio career, like wee for a wee.  I just...  I just...  You could...  I obviously hope he knows where I'm coming from, and I obviously don't have a job in  radio yet, but... 
[02:45:00]  Why do we have a job?  Why do we know?  He hosts the Opie and Anthony show.  He never made a doody hat.  He kept it to the mustache.  We've been doing this for 20-some-odd years.  We've done some shitty stuff.  So where are you working?  What are you talking about?  Where are you working?  Yeah.  I am a waiter right now.  Where?  It's in his distro.  It's in Cranberry, New Jersey.  You bring people their food, and then they go, ew, you're a doody hat guy.  Don't touch my food.  Only the still. 
[02:45:30]  And it proves that it didn't affect you, because what restaurant owner would fucking hire you  knowing you'd play with doody in your spare time?  Well, I...  And Jared is also not taking into account the string of unsuccessful interns that the  Opie and Anthony show has pumped out.  That's true.  Not many big winners, big hits.  Has one gone on to fame?  I mean, you're talking about...  I know the one kid made his video.  Yeah, angry. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, God.  You guys want to watch that?  Oh, is that bad?  Wait, did we see Doody Hat first?  There's Doody Hat.  It was a good one, right?  Doody Hat, the follow-up.  It's not as good as the first one.  The follow-up?  Sequels are never as good.  I don't remember Doody Hat.  It's very rare.  I don't even remember this one.  Uh-oh.  Ah, boy, that's so wonderful.  Yeah, great.  Is the opening to the hat facing up, or is the top of the hat...  Oh, the opening.  Oh, yeah.  Don't keep the door open, you fucking sicko.  I was going to fill it.  That's right.  I'll fill that hat up.  It looks like someone took the tail of a man's hat. 
[02:46:30]  All right, here's...  All right, here's...  We're a little rotten...  By the way, for our...  Oh, my God.  There's a cap in the toilet.  An open shit is...  You should have wiped it and threw it on his hat, so they made him wear it.  So, you want your job?  Put this on.  Let's go for a take here.  Here we go.  And...  Oh, boy!  A duty hat! 
[02:47:00]  Comes to his toilet.  Hat has a log in it.  He's rinsed the water out of it.  A duty, then here goes...  I'm going to flip that on.  This could be the best thing.  Keep going.  Keep going.  This is perfect.  A duty hat.  He's looking in truth.  Come on, now.  He's drained all the water in here.  Come on.  A duty hat's time.  He's just having fun. 
[02:47:30]  A duty hat's time.  AHH!  AHH!  Hey, the improv.  I don't like the improv.  No, put your dick off.  Does he have shit in there?  No, he didn't put the hat squarely in his hat.  You didn't put the hat on.  I'm not fucking accepting that.  Why?  You've got to put that hat on and pull the wind down.  Take two.  More duty in the hat.  Oh, boy!  A duty hat! 
[02:48:00]  Duty hat.  I'm going to take two.  He's turning the hat.  There it is.  AHH!  AHH!  AHH!  AHH!  AHH!  AHH!  Get a轟 right now!  Oh, my God!  He just smashed it on his head.  ACH!  AHH!  ACH!  AHH!  ACH!  ACH!  ACH!  ACH!  ACH!  ACH!  ACH!  There's less in the hat. 
[02:48:30]  He's shampooing his hair.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Duty hat.  That was from a few years back.  Well, Cream Pie, you know.  What do you want?  What do you want from us?  Cream Pie, that was like three years ago.  Yeah.  I know.  It's still there.  Bon Jovi got a job in radio.  Yeah.  Intern Bon Jovi.  He works for...  Shit hat video.  Duty.  Duty hat.  Shit would be tacky. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Well, duty.  Cream Pie, congratulations.  You made Sam's top five stupidest intern list.  Stupidest intern.  What do we have so far on that list?  Ricky and Cream Pie.  Ricky, Cream Pie, love, buzz.  Right.  This kid.  All right.  We got to go.  Cream Pie, we got to let you go for now.  Come in and say hi to us.  Yeah, come on, Cream Pie, you douche.  I don't think they would allow us to do fucking duty hats here.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We got to move on to the next thing.  Strawberry feature.  Special delivery, 9, midnight, Saturday.  Very good. 
[02:49:30]  Special delivery with Sam and Dave.  Thank you, Cream Pie.  Saturday nights at 9.  Easter.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Well, you got to explain this kid.  His name has been a while.  All right.  This is known.  We actually, the last time there was a sick day and you guys did worst of, Iraq and I  recapped the whole Noah saga.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, so they know.  He was a rich kid, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think the way he looked, talked, moved, everything he did was that of a gay person.  Not as gay as Sean, though. 
[02:50:00]  He was more like, no, I would say more gay than Sean.  Really?  He was more performance-oriented, flamboyant than Sean.  Yeah.  Sean's more like effeminate, but he's more flamboyant.  Yeah.  This guy is flamboyant.  Right.  This video.  The famous truck of strawberry to his nice shoes.  Yeah.  How did that go down?  Because I don't remember anymore.  He put the shoe on the table and it enraged me.  I had to throw a strawberry at it.  I think we were looking at his outfit and he was explaining how expensive his outfit was.  He dressed every day for his internship. 
[02:50:30]  And clothes that none of us have.  I think they were Gucci loafers or something.  Yeah.  And you asked to see him and then he put one of his shoes up on the console and he just  fucking hope he wailed a strawberry out of chocolate strawberry.  He was so mad.  This video had to have cost a few bucks.  Well, what?  He made a music video.  Yeah.  But let's.  All right.  So he leaves our internship and then what happened to the kid?  He went to L.A. or something?  Well, he was always a budding pop star.  He had this song while he was interning.  He was working on it.  Then he left the internship and was able to produce the video out in L.A. 
[02:51:00]  What's your song called?  Julia.  Julia.  Remember?  Julia.  We used to play it on our show before the video.  We got to start from the beginning.  Yeah.  Start from the beginning.  And listen, this is the most production they could get out of it.  And he's terrible.  Our influences were really from like the Southern California skate, punk rock.  I don't want to get behind the music with this kid.  Mark Hoppus.  Yeah.  Something else going on there.  All right.  Let's try it.  Here it is.  How many views? 
[02:51:30]  A big Cadillac pulls up.  A big white Rolls Royce pulls up.  How the fuck did he get that?  So far, it's very trite.  Yeah.  His father owned like car dealerships or something.  He had plenty of cash.  It's Julia J-E-W, by the way.  Hebrew girl.  He's a Jew.  He's so bad and off King and everything.  Can you turn this up a little?  I want to really crank this.  I got you with me on the street.  Strolling down Third Avenue.  The other guy's there. 
[02:52:00]  I want to pull up a fight.  You're a wild cat out of the suit.  Miracally, it's good.  You're my boyish mind.  Can't contain me.  You're just my kind.  Ch-ch-ch-chulia.  You're up in trouble for the world.  Got me calling on the spur.  Got me crying out for my world.  There's so much a dream. 
[02:52:30]  But if you wrote the song, why would you put yourself in an octave that you can't hit?  Why would you do that?  This is so bad.  She's great.  Catchy.  I like the J-J-J-J-Julie.  He's holding a cane and white gloves.  Yeah.  It's good.  He's dressed for a minstrel show.  Here comes the hook again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't help that he's shorter than every girl in his video. 
[02:53:00]  He fell off the curb and almost killed himself.  What a twerk.  That bad falsetto.  He's laying in, like, bags from expensive stores.  Yeah.  Girls are mobbing him in the same car scene.  Showing eight times.  Slow motion club dance footage.  Oh, wow.  Someone breakdancing.  We need breakdancing. 
[02:53:30]  This has got to be a joke.  I know.  He was hoping this was going to be a big joke.  No.  He was serious.  That was so bad.  J-J-J-J-Julie.  I'd play this at a party.  Yeah.  Stop making noise. 
[02:54:00]  You're spoiling the song.  And then, look.  You've got to be kidding me.  The video's got to end.  Take me to Chanel.  He's the driver of the car.  See, he was not the big star.  He's the chauffeur.  Oh, wait.  But look. 
[02:54:30]  Or is he?  He tips his hat like, yeah.  What does that mean, you fucking fruit?  I don't know.  But at the end, it was like the reveal is that he's not this piece.  He's just a fantasizing Rolls-Royce limo driver.  But he tips and, like, kind of smiles at the camera.  Looked at the camera and tipped his hat like Burt Reynolds in fucking Smoking the Bandit when he pulled away from the...  Behind the Little Shed.  How does Cream Pie Jones expect to get a job if he doesn't have a pop song out? 
[02:55:00]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!  I don't think his music career  has taken off.  I'm on his YouTube channel  and he doesn't have any more  songs or videos.  He hasn't logged in for a year.  Really?  Maybe the ninja got him.  Did he? 
[02:55:30]  But he doesn't make your top five  stupid intern list, does he?  He wasn't stupid.  He had his own thing.  Somebody is suggesting  Frankenberry?  Frankenberry only lasted one day.  He was so stupid.  He was traded to Ron and Feds  immediately.  They were so pissed.  Who was that kid who looked like Dawson's Creek?  Clayton?  That was my class.  Is that long ago?  Clayton was really stupid.  Clayton was really stupid. 
[02:56:00]  This is the epitome of this.  We went to Times Square with Clayton.  I think we were walking to the Hard Rock or something for an event.  Yeah, Trap Rock.  And Nathaniel...  Who?  Trap Dog.  Old guy.  Stumpering?  No.  There's a statue in Times Square.  Somebody.  I don't know.  And Than points to Clayton and he goes,  Hey, you see that statue?  That's Arthur Times.  The creator of Times Square.  And Clayton goes,  Oh, that's awesome.  But that was the same day we walked down Broadway where all the plays are. 
[02:56:30]  You know the Broadway shows?  Yes.  Clayton actually turned to the guys on the show and said,  Hey, are there a lot of Broadway plays around here?  On Broadway.  Actually asked that question.  In New York.  Yeah.  So you're right.  He's also intern Matt Damon.  Should definitely be on the stupidest intern list.  Would this be your third pick?  Well, I have Ricky.  Cream Pie and Ricky.  Cream Pie.  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz is definitely.  Well, it ends with Love Buzz.  He's behind you waiting to talk. 
[02:57:00]  Who's that kid that went to Syracuse?  Sam Roberts?  Oh, Sam.  Yeah.  A lot of people say,  Don't forget Adam the intern.  Adam was a liar.  I don't know if he was stupid.  We had a lot of liars.  Yeah, yeah.  He was a horrible liar.  Because we had Eyepatch guy who was the biggest liar ever to be part of this show.  I was just thinking of the other day.  Remember that?  He wasn't an XM intern.  He was a CBS intern.  But Jimmy was grilling him about why he was a virgin and what he jerked off to.  He freaked out. 
[02:57:30]  He used to come over to the XM side.  And he stopped, right?  And Jim talked to him for like an hour, grilling him about jerking off.  He was like he had a buzz cut and always wore black basketball socks.  I don't remember.  But he took your line of questioning as offensive and stopped coming to the satellite side.  Really?  Derek hates that kid.  He's just screaming his ugly fucking socks.  Yeah.  That set Derek off great.  So there's a...  Did you like intern David?  I loved intern David.  Yeah, he was a classic.  He wasn't stupid. 
[02:58:00]  He's the number one intern of all time.  Wow.  Yeah, I agree.  He is the number one intern.  He wasn't stupid.  No.  He was the greatest.  You're right.  You had mentioned intern Adam.  He was the one that we got into his email.  And he was telling somebody that he got to meet Sylvester Stallone when he was on the show.  But we never had him on the show.  Yeah.  Well, we had like a phone call maybe.  But he didn't talk to him on the phone.  He didn't even come close to meeting him.  And then when he had to write to his advisor, I guess, back at his college, he was just shitting on you guys.  Like how we treat him.  He referred to you to...  That's the one when he referred to you to as the talent in quotations. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, right.  Thank you guys.  You guys gave him his comeuppance for that one.  Yeah.  What an asshole.  That's also how it says it in the contract here.  What a dick.  But yeah, he was a dick.  He wasn't stupid.  So it's Cream Pie Jones.  Ricky.  Ricky.  Love Buzz.  What about Evan?  Love Buzz.  Evan.  And Clayton.  How many pills is Evan up to?  Evan.  He's gone and he stopped talking to anybody.  How many milligrams was he up to? 
[02:59:00]  He admitted to it.  He was taking 90 milligrams of Adderall a day.  Of Adderall.  Swivel hips.  He was tall.  Swivel hips.  Oh.  Pissed all over himself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the other guy that used to get fucked up at all the live performances?  Anthony Comey.  You were never an intern.  No, you used to.  It was kind of a, I guess, short guy.  He pissed people off all the time.  Oh my God.  God.  Oh, he fucked up.  He played.  Who, Bill? 
[02:59:30]  Oh, Bill.  Yeah, Bill.  Oh.  Bill.  Bill almost got us fired.  Bill played.  Yeah, Bill almost got us fired by replaying a bit that was like, should have been burned.  I mean, he might win stupidest employee because he actually made it.  He actually made it into getting paid.  That's right.  I liked Bill.  If it wasn't for Bill, Butcher wouldn't be on our staff.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Wow.  Not much excitement after that statement, Iraq.  Great, great.  Good one, Iraq.  Right on.  Iraq.  You're also forgetting intern Nosferatu who would fall asleep standing up or sitting in 
[03:00:00]  a chair.  No, wait a minute.  I remember stupid.  Like a horse.  Wait, wait.  Wait, let's not forget about Nosferatu.  Well, Nosferatu was good, but.  We'd play the music whenever he walked in.  Oh, Takana, yeah.  Takana.  He was the ugliest intern.  Oh, he's very ugly.  Who, he came down from Boston.  Remember, he was like married with a kid.  Oh, Tim.  Tim, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I like Tim.  He boiled all sorts of eggs and they weren't hard boiled.  So, we locked him in the studio and pelted hard boiled eggs at him.  Oh, he got hard boiled eggs at him. 
[03:00:30]  We needed hard boiled eggs.  Oh, he says, I like Tim.  And Danny reminds him, yeah, Tim's the guy that you locked in a studio and threw raw eggs  at.  Yeah, that guy he liked.  Oh, I liked him.  His marriage and his whole family fell apart because he wanted to be an intern.  He was from Springfield, Mass.  Yeah, and he would drive down here and then sleep in his car.  Twice a week or something.  Yeah, and he would just sleep in his car for his internship and then drive back to Massachusetts.  Oh, God.  And was he 40 or something?  No, he wasn't that old.  That was the other guy.  But, uh...  Who was the oldest intern?  He was 40.  Well, there was...  There was Scott. 
[03:01:00]  Scott.  No, no, no.  Well, technically, I think, wasn't the oldest intern, the guy that only lasted recently,  like two weeks?  Robert Goulet.  John Waters.  Yeah.  Robert Goulet.  He got upset because he was scolded.  Kenny scolded him at one point for breaking one of the rules.  And, uh...  Which is what?  No smiling?  When Kenny scolds the interns, he makes his point very clear.  Yes.  And he's not jovial about it, so he took, uh...  Not so well to that.  He didn't last too long.  Wow.  But Scott, the other 40-year-old intern, he lasted a full semester, and he was actually 
[03:01:30]  a good intern.  Much better than most of these guys.  But he was 40.  He was 40.  Well, that's why he was probably better at things a little more.  He's way better than Liberians.  Love Buzz.  Uh, there was also, uh, intern Tom, who Jimmy insisted was, uh, assigned to bring in his  food because he had such short arms that Jimmy calls him, uh, Jurassic Park arms.  Yeah, Jurassic Park arms.  Remember him?  No!  Yeah, no, because we used to play the Jurassic Park music every time we walked into the studio.  That's right.  And we had to point out how horrible... 
[03:02:00]  I love entrance music.  Yeah, entrance music really is good, man.  We had to point out how bad his little arms were.  One of the best stories of the, uh, virus interns was Bobby the Champ, who went from  being Ron and Fez's MVP guy, he walked around with a championship belt on, he was the champion  of interns number one.  For Ron and Fez?  Yes, and then he walked down to the Opie and Anthony show, and not only...  First he was just a nobody, and then he became Bobby Nohomo.  He was the one who did all... 
[03:02:30]  All he did, all he was known for was touching the staffers.  Bobby Nohomo.  Oh, that's right.  Holy shit.  I forgot about it.  And then Jay Moore got naked and molested.  In studio, Jay Moore took all of his clothes off and mounted Bobby the Intern.  What a bunch of fucking clowns.  Yeah.  Wow, internship programs have changed since I was an intern.  The, uh, there was, um...  When I was an intern, we had that show that we could probably talk about now. 
[03:03:00]  No show.  Oh, yeah, that one.  That was a fun one.  Nosferatu.  Was that when we first started?  Yeah.  Is that with the bats?  I'm just curious.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't fuck anybody unprotected on an office desk.  No.  No.  No one did.  Of course not.  We had to sit out two years, three months, and we almost were refired a week back.  Oh, yeah.  A week.  A week, maybe two weeks back.  No, you know what?  I think it was about a month.  Yeah, we were all...  It was that long.  I think it was about six weeks.  It was November. 
[03:03:30]  Put it this way, it was really close to us being first back on the air.  So it was about six weeks.  Six weeks.  We almost...  Yeah, about that.  Got fired again.  What do you mean?  The fucking passed out girl being carried across 57th Street?  Like a sack of shit?  And through the lobby?  While I might have been sticking my dick in someone with no condom in what would someday  be Ron and Fez's office?  That non-event?  What about...  It wasn't shit.  What about the naked girl that was trying to sober up outside on 57th Street as real 
[03:04:00]  business people are going to work?  There was a loading dock involved.  Hiding stuff behind false walls.  What?  Tampering with evidence.  What about the girl that was naked trying to leave the studio and basically trying to  open a window to leave or what?  To jump out the fifth floor window.  She didn't...  She walks past Anthony thinking there's a door. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, that was great.  Not even a clue there was a door there.  There was a Twitter from somebody, I guess it's a perspective intern, somebody.  Oh, yeah, we interviewed him.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Did he tell you that I was like, oh, brother, here it comes?  I said, generally, you should probably keep off the Twitter and message, oh, yeah, I know,  I already learned that.  I told him that maybe when you're coming to intern and you're a big fan of the show,  pay attention to what other interns have gotten in trouble for, and maybe don't do that. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, there was one intern that just like randomly started texting or PMing through a message board, PMing my ex-girlfriend.  Why?  She was my girlfriend at the time.  Just from posts.  Who was that?  And he's like, yeah, let me do that.  I don't know what his name was.  Mike?  Mike?  No.  I remember.  Who did that?  I remember the story.  I don't remember the story.  Yeah, it was on the air.  But my chick at the time, she's like, check this out. 
[03:05:30]  This is one of your interns.  I was like, holy shit.  Yeah, I go, just keep going then.  You know, keep talking because he had no idea.  So back and forth with messages and stuff, he's telling shit about the show.  Oh, perfect.  And stuff, and I'm just watching.  I'm like, all right.  Did you know it was your girlfriend?  No.  Had no clue.  Wow.  And I saw everything he was writing.  And then his last day was coming up within days.  So I just waited until it was his last day.  I go, oh, so you want a good little report or something? 
[03:06:00]  I go, by the way, what were you doing on the message boards PMing people about the show?  I didn't do that.  Oh, really?  You're calling my girlfriend a liar?  What do you mean?  What?  What?  I go, all of those are being sent to my house, you dummy.  I read every single one of them.  He turned white.  He turned fucking white.  I have a theory that, for whatever reason, Sirius XM and XM gave us and gives us the worst  interns that apply to be on satellite radio. 
[03:06:30]  I can't imagine that other shows have interns as bad as ours.  The Morning Mashup has these interns that they're going out and doing stuff, and they're  coming up with these great ideas.  They're like, why do you treat your interns so poorly?  I mean, I try to give these interns a benefit of the doubt.  We've got to get two more on your top five stupidest intern list.  Harry T.  Yeah.  Oh, Harry T.  Another one who went from...  Oh, he went from fucking rags to riches to rags.  To rags. 
[03:07:00]  To worse.  Harry T.  That was another one from my class.  Ron and Fez, right?  Well, yeah.  He was...  Him and me interned for the same Opie and Anthony class.  Yeah.  And then he, even though he was a shitty Opie and Anthony intern, ended up producing  Ron and Fez.  I called him a lying sack of cunt.  Correct.  I believe...  You're missing another one?  Yeah.  British Bob.  Oh, he was great.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, it's Bob.  He had nothing going on.  No, he really did. 
[03:07:30]  He just walked in there and smiled.  Like, yeah.  Just rosacea.  No, one day...  British Bob.  One day we decided that he had to be British, even though he's from Jersey.  And we refused to acknowledge him unless he talked British.  And he did the worst British accent.  Oh, he couldn't even do it.  Did we have some audio British, Bob?  He ruined it.  And boom, it's your uncle.  And we never let it go.  We refused to let it go.  There was also the one intern...  Well, do you remember...  I was going to say, do you remember Ugly Betty?  She was over at CBS.  She didn't last.  K-Rock. 
[03:08:00]  She didn't come to the feedback.  She lasted about three days.  And then...  And I remember during the interview, we were like, look, you know, it's a rough environment.  You know, you're going to get made fun of.  Like, the whole spiel that the intern applicants get when they come in to apply.  The applicant is a bum.  I think it was like our second or third day, and then Opie called her Ugly Betty, and she  never showed up again.  Me again.  Why is it always me?  Ugly Betty.  Why is it always me?  There was a collection we have had.  The one intern who lost his internship because he punched Steve in his chest. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was so funny.  He fucking flare-chopped Steve by accident because Bon Jovi had this prank that he used  to do because this kid was very serious, and Bon Jovi, the intern, used to go behind  him and call him Salt Neck and pour salt packets on his neck.  Whenever he bent over...  What the fuck does that even mean?  Salt Neck.  Salt Neck.  He'd pour salt on his neck and say, what's up, Salt Neck?  We have a lot of fun after the show.  And then one day, Bon Jovi did it. 
[03:09:00]  He poured salt.  The kid swings around to punch, and all that's there is Steve's barrel chest.  Wow.  And Steve...  Salt Neck punches a cum mouth.  Steve was not happy with that and let him know that his internship had just ended.  What about the first Noah?  Remember the first one?  He came in.  He was part of the original interns on the XM portion. 
[03:09:30]  Really?  When...  I think it might have been a Cherry Darts thing where some chick came in and she was  like a porn star slash escort or something, and then the girl liked him and ended up going  home with him.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  Yeah, his name was Noah.  Wait, was he Noah?  He was Noah, and she was from Cleveland.  I don't remember.  And Jimmy was working the girl, too.  Yeah.  And she picked Noah.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, I remember that.  She wanted to charge me like 5,000 bucks to fuck her.  And she gave it to him for nothing. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Good move to get plugs, dumb whore.  Back to Cleveland.  Hope she's blowing doornails now.  Hope she's getting her mouth wrapped around a railroad spike.  She's sucking that for some fucking fetish company.  If it's any consolation, we were once doing the walkover to XM, and randomly, he was walking  down the street, and he said, hey, guys, what's up?  And everybody said hi, and in the middle of everything, Danny, being the sensitive boy 
[03:10:30]  that he is, just stuck his finger out and said, ha-ha, you don't work here.  Yeah, but you know what?  I think he stayed in radio.  He got a gig somewhere.  Right.  Dropping, I think.  All right.  So, finally, you got Cream Pie.  Cream Pie Jones.  Ricky.  Ricky.  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz.  Two more on your stupidest intern list.  I thought we were doing Clayton?  Clayton.  Yeah, Clayton.  He gave the Clayton story.  And who should be fifth? 
[03:11:00]  I mean, Matt Damon was stupid.  Matt Damon.  I love that they give him names and just fuck with him.  He was, like, this really good-looking guy who was used to being, like, the king of his  school.  And for the last 30 days of his internship, every day, we'd go back to XM, we'd put a  giant Tupperware bin over his head and just start smacking it for, like, a half an hour.  It's just fucking ridiculous. 
[03:11:30]  It's torture.  Don't forget Renee.  Renee.  Renee.  She wasn't stupid.  No, she's nice, though.  She was pretty good.  Renee was a good intern.  Fuck.  Renee and Jill are the two female interns we've had, and they have been better than almost  any male intern.  Any other guys, yeah.  They're doing well, too.  They both have kids.  Yeah, they both have jobs.  Renee doesn't.  Oh.  She's looking.  She's working for her?  Is he 100 or something?  They let her go.  Well, I don't even know if she was working or just interned.  Oh, maybe she was interning for them.  I mean, Love Buzz is really...  He's right behind you. 
[03:12:00]  That's fair.  Love Buzz is making his way to the top of the list very fast.  Love Buzz, aren't you excited that maybe in the future on the show we'll be reminiscing  about dumb interns and your name will come up?  Oh, I can't wait.  Actually, the thing I have to say about it is...  To put everything into context, he came to me this weekend and said, you know, the  internships are ending, I'm sticking around for another semester, there's going to be  new interns coming in, and I'm really excited that I'm going to be going to the next level 
[03:12:30]  and becoming the lead intern here.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I had a bad morning to start off my first day as the lead intern.  I just fucked up.  He just did air quotes.  Yeah.  How'd you fuck up, Love Buzz?  I just fucked up.  I forgot to ask Sam what he wanted for breakfast.  So Sam beat me down for about 10 minutes.  That'll happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he asked everybody else except me and made me feel like I didn't matter.  Yeah.  No, you...  What, you got him on a Pay No Mind list, kid?  Exactly. 
[03:13:00]  You got to call up cartoon companies, man.  He forgets Jim's beverage every other day.  It's not right.  In the interviews, Steve's quote is, once you've mastered the art of getting coffee, you  move on to other things, which applies to getting breakfast.  Love Buzz has been here an entire semester and hasn't even come close to mastering food  orders.  Why can't you master food orders?  I'm really dyslexic.  Like, I don't want to fuck up the money.  Like, my main concern is bringing back the wrong change, and I guess that just gets me. 
[03:13:30]  How about the wrong order?  I told him what I wanted today.  He didn't write it down.  Yeah.  And then he came back and he said, what did you...  Hey, it's like one of those waiters.  You go into the restaurant and you blurt out your order and they don't even take it down.  Troy...  They just nod at you.  Yeah.  How about you write it down?  I'm not impressed with your nodding skills.  Exactly.  Troy and me have taught Love Buzz and Dustin how to do things in the profit audio system.  Dustin always writes down in his little notebook, and Love Buzz never does. 
[03:14:00]  And you can ask him any question.  And I bet Love Buzz...  He won't know any answers.  Won't remember anything.  Right.  What have you learned here, Love Buzz?  What have I learned here?  Yeah, your semester's over.  Well, before I started here, if you remember my first day you played those videos, well,  I like to interview people.  They don't remember.  They don't remember.  You guys don't remember.  I remember the videos where you yell at people or whatever.  You yell at your ex-girlfriend.  Well, Sam taught...  They were truly terrible.  Yeah, they weren't bad.  Even when I did them, I did say these are pretty bad, and people were angry that I did  them. 
[03:14:30]  But anyway, Sam taught me not to make myself the center of attention in an interview and  come up with clever questions and make the person sound stupid instead of just taking  over.  But he lost me.  Yeah, I know.  No one knows what he's talking about.  You know, make the person sound stupid, because the person and the people know me that it's  not stupid, but the stupid person...  What?  Sam just taught me not to be the center of attention.  The problem is that he's telling you things that he's quote-unquote been taught, but has  not applied to anything. 
[03:15:00]  He's got a weird voice.  Yeah, I know.  His hair is like a fucking Lego person.  It's a cartoon voice, though.  It's almost like a lisp thing, but then there's a talking, kind of a nasal voice thing.  And he's dumb, too.  He's dumb as dirt.  Dumb as dirt.  You really are.  Yeah.  You really are dumb.  You're a dummy.  You're really a dummy.  How do you get through a school being so stupid?  I'm not dumb.  I go to Stony Brook.  That's going to be Love Buzz's quote of infamy now. 
[03:15:30]  That is a great one.  Yeah, we'll be like, remember Love Buzz?  Who is he?  Remember the guy that said, I'm not dumb, I go to Stony Brook?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's a really hard school to get into.  Shoot us with...  Give us some knowledge.  It's harder to drive out there.  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty much the hard part of getting to Stony Brook is the drive.  How would you impress us with your brain right now?  Yeah.  Give us a little knowledge.  Something where we go, holy shit.  Yo, get your fucking knowledge on.  Yeah.  What would you come up with? 
[03:16:00]  Spit some knowledge.  Something that proves you're not dumb.  Go.  Oh, this is great.  Now I'm on the spot.  Now I'm really going to look dumb.  Go.  Got to give us something.  You got to give me a subject.  Nothing.  You go to school.  You got to give us something.  How about you just impart...  Or this is your last day.  You impart some knowledge on us that you have learned,  that you feel you know and maybe we're not familiar with.  Something you're knowledgeable with.  Go ahead.  Go.  Share some knowledge.  Like if I was to do it, 
[03:16:30]  I would probably like tell a little something about avionics or something.  That's something I'm interested in.  History.  History.  Things like that.  Well, Hitler or something.  So go ahead.  Go.  I do love to write.  Like writing's always been one of my strong points.  So what are you going to tell...  I don't...  This isn't a what do you like.  What kind of writing?  You say, give us some knowledge.  Teach us something.  Go.  Lesson two.  Dead air is not good.  Yeah, I know.  You make the virus look like Stephen Hawking. 
[03:17:00]  What are you doing?  Come on.  Give us something.  Give us some knowledge.  Teach.  Come on.  You must know something that we don't know.  What makes a good paper?  How do you be a good writer?  Oh my God.  His mouth is all dry.  Did you see that?  Sam goes, what makes a good paper?  He goes, paper.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Fucking gargling with Elmer's glue.  Oh my God.  Are you stupid?  You all right? 
[03:17:30]  Oh, I'm fine.  You got cotton mouth.  Yeah.  It's just...  No one give him water.  No, of course not.  Go ahead, Sam Lips.  Talk.  What kind of writing do you do?  I like creative writing.  Have you written anything for the show?  I have written stuff for the show.  You have?  Like what?  Anything we've used?  I wrote a Twitter promo.  Actually.  I wrote.  By the way, you just heard the writer say, I've wrote. 
[03:18:00]  How is that supposed to be spoken?  What should you have said there?  Instead of, I've wrote.  I have written a Twitter promo in the past.  Sure.  Love this kid.  Oh my God.  So stupid, right?  Yeah.  So fucking stupid.  So come on, sock tongue.  Tell us something.  Sock tongue.  Tell us something.  Give us a little knowledge, please.  Yeah, come on.  You can do it.  Give us a little lesson on something you know about.  It doesn't necessarily have to be from school. 
[03:18:30]  It could be from anything you've learned that you thought maybe was a little interesting.  Go.  Go ahead.  You're up.  All right.  Oh, hey, look.  More dead air.  All right.  Go.  One thing I'm really interested in, actually, is like this is whole.  Holy fuck.  That was just like, you know, when you ask a little kid, like, so what did you do on  your summer vacation?  Yeah.  Well, what I did on my summer vacation is. 
[03:19:00]  As he's trying to think of.  Why don't you just, you don't know anything?  What do you major in at Stony Brook?  Journalism.  Okay.  So tell us something about journalism.  No, no, no.  I wanted to finish that thought.  He was going somewhere there.  Thought?  What was it?  Well, I've been really interested in cyberbullying.  Like, Facebook and Twitter and this other website.  I mean, he's looking to get into it.  No, no, no, no.  I wanted to start cyberbullying.  I've actually. 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  So people cyberbully on this Facebook you speak of?  Oh, yeah, all the time.  Why are you interested in that?  Because I like to see how people react on the internet as to how they would react in  person.  As to the internet.  As to how they would react.  As to how they would react.  As opposed to how they would react in person.  On the internet?  Yeah?  Yeah.  On the internet.  So what have you found?  What's your, um, do you have a theory on anything or?  Well, I had bothered. 
[03:20:00]  Hypothesis?  Well, I bothered this one person on the internet a few weeks ago.  And this was an experiment?  Yeah, he was talking trash about me at my old job.  And I decided to confront him a little.  Confront him.  He can't speak.  Carolina man just writes, I love it when you guys break people's souls.  It's hilarious.  All right, continue, love, Buzz. 
[03:20:30]  Where do you used to work?  I used to work in a Pathmark.  He's a genius.  And then after that, I worked in child support for Suffolk County.  Jesus.  Anyway, as you were saying.  Oh, God.  Oh.  That was it?  That was the whole story?  You teased somebody on Facebook and that's why you're smart?  No, he just.  Started calling me.  He started calling me a bitch.  And then I went on his line at Pathmark.  Because he's a cashier there. 
[03:21:00]  And he was very friendly to me.  And I just found it interesting that.  Oh, God.  This is not fucking good.  This is just stares.  You haven't said anything.  They're waiting for you to get to the point.  I just like how people are braver on the internet than in person.  This is something Anthony has said.  How many times?  Everybody that gets shit said about them, you're always like, well, you know, I'd like to confront  them maybe and do it face-to-face and not over the intern tubes. 
[03:21:30]  So, LoveBuzz's way of proving that he's smart is people are braver when they are not face-to-face  with you.  And his way of conveying his smarts to you is letting you know that he was on CompuServe  once.  Is that it, LoveBuzz?  Yeah.  Is that all?  Can we read all about it on your GeoCities page?  Would you like to?  Angel Fiery Upgraded.  Do you realize you've imparted nothing to us?  You've given us no knowledge. 
[03:22:00]  Nothing that you felt you knew that you could tell us.  Look, I'm really nervous.  I don't know what you want me to say.  Just keep on laughing at me.  Oh, here's something.  Okay, look, I'll just tell you this.  Did he just say, look, I'm really nervous.  If you have an aircraft, there are forces working on that aircraft when it's flying.  There is thrust, which moves it forward, lift, which makes it go in the air, gravity, which 
[03:22:30]  is trying to pull it down, and drag, which is trying to keep it from going forward.  That's why you have the thrust, the energy.  And that is pretty much the four basic...  The four basic...  You're catching a lot, bud.  I'm nervous.  I'm nervous.  Forces.  What happened?  You're enrolling in Stony Brook? 
[03:23:00]  It's just that it's contagious.  Yeah.  No, the four basic forces working on an aircraft to make it fly.  Things you have to overcome, things that overcome, and you have flight.  See, that's just something that I knew that I figured I'd tell you.  Thank you.  Now, is there anything you know that you could tell us?  I know where you could find some wise stickers.  Yeah, they're in the office.  Go on.  Where's the nearest Tim Hortons? 
[03:23:30]  It's like a block away from here.  All right.  Maybe you should go.  We, uh...  You have nothing.  You have no knowledge.  You really have no knowledge.  I'm drawing a blank right now.  Everyone's just looking at me.  You just put me on the spot.  Yeah, but you've been on the spot.  I've been on the spot.  Yo, look.  I'm bored with it, all right?  All right? 
[03:24:00]  I go dancing.  That's all I know.  I go dancing on the weekends down at the disco.  We're still trying to get knowledge out of here.  I don't have any knowledge to say right now because I really am drawing a blank.  I don't have...  I need knowledge to say.  I have nothing to say right now.  But there's got to be something you know.  Just tell us anything that you know.  You're on the radio.  Give us a factoid.  Yeah.  Just anything. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, boy.  You're wearing a Lakers shirt.  Does that mean anything?  I don't know.  Give us one fact.  Wait, does the Lakers shirt mean anything?  I like the Lakers.  I've got the Lakers.  Oh, my God.  What do you like about the Lakers?  We'll go there.  Of course.  Kobe Bryant.  Right.  Yeah.  I enjoy it.  Yeah.  We're done here.  But you know what?  Even if you don't know the NBA, everyone would say Kobe Bryant. 
[03:25:00]  I know Kobe Bryant.  Right.  And Sam hates sports.  He's one of the greatest, I think he's one of the greatest players of all time.  He's a good player, but.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You're on to something.  I look up to people who do really good in life.  Should be everyone but you.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  That means you're never looking down.  Oh.  Sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  Lakers.  Kobe Bryant.  What's another person who plays for the Lakers? 
[03:25:30]  Another person?  Lamar Odom.  Does he still play for the Lakers?  Oh, Jesus.  He's a rabid fan.  You're wearing this shirt.  Well, I like Kobe Bryant.  I'm not going to say I'm a crazy Lakers fan.  I'm just a big fan of Kobe Bryant.  I don't know any other team members.  Nothing crazy.  You just like accused rapists in Colorado, whoever that is.  I'm so glad it's an individual sport all of a sudden.  What's length times width?  Length times width?  How many?  How many?  How many?  He doesn't know. 
[03:26:00]  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  How many quarters in a basketball game?  There's four.  All right.  Length times width.  Isn't that an area?  I don't know.  Is it?  Yeah.  How many minutes in a quarter?  There are 15.  Wait, no.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on the spot.  You're wearing this shirt.  He doesn't know anything about basketball.  That's not what his knowledge base is.  Aren't you right?  15?  It's 12.  It's 12 minutes.  It's all right.  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  That's what Obi said.  Anything.  Anything you can teach us.  Do you know anything about anything?  Is there anything about anything?  I figure I'm a big fan of baseball.  Are you?  I could give you...  All right.  Give us something about baseball.  Ant's a big fan of baseball.  Yeah, I love the baseball.  Or Yankees, anyway.  Reggie Jackson has 586 home runs.  All right.  I think...  You can look that up.  The only people to have two triple crowns each are...  I think it's Frank Robinson and Ted Williams. 
[03:27:00]  Frank Robinson.  Frank Williams.  Hold on a second.  I want to talk to Warren Haynes.  Fucking Aussie.  Fucking Aussie won 1980s.  Yeah, that's a very early 80s Aussie.  Early 80s.  Yeah, that's right.  What a fucking mess.  Frank Robinson is also the only player to have the triple crown in both the National and  the American League.  No, that's not true.  It's not? 
[03:27:30]  I thought it was.  And he didn't win it twice.  He didn't?  He didn't?  Oh, I thought he did.  So, in the future, you can impress people with the knowledge that it was Ted Williams  and Roger Hornsby.  Okay.  Right.  I was right about Ted Williams.  Yes.  You were half right.  Right.  That's not bad.  Yes.  And Roger Hornsby.  I'll give you a 50 on a test.  Yeah.  That's failing, unfortunately.  That's a failing grade.  So...  What else do you know about baseball?  Big baseball fan, eh?  Well, no.  It would be what do you know.  No, what else?  Because so far, it's nothing.  Oh, true, true.  Yeah.  So, what do you know?  Give us something you know about baseball. 
[03:28:00]  Well, I've kind of waned off the baseball.  You just said it.  Yeah, well, I haven't been able to watch it too much since I started here.  I've been going to sleep earlier.  But you're the one who brought it up.  And there's games on during the day.  I watch wrestling.  And there's articles about those games.  Travis, how do you keep up with baseball?  I don't know.  I've got to go to bed early.  There's ESPN, SportsCenter, the internet.  I thought you just said you were a big fan of baseball. 
[03:28:30]  He's talking to you, Love Bus.  Come on, Love Bus.  What do I do when I go home?  No.  Opie said I thought you were a big fan of baseball.  Yeah.  It's just this season, I've kind of just waned off of it.  Oh, perfect.  What's your favorite team?  Well, I'm a Yankee fan.  All right.  Name four guys on the Yankees.  There's Derek Jeter.  Of course.  Well, that's an easy one.  Exactly.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  That's why I said of course.  By the way, he's twitching so bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else?  Who else are the Yankees? 
[03:29:00]  An obscure one is Randy Nguyen.  They have a fucking, what's his name?  Sorry, he's a backup dude.  It's okay.  Oh, no.  He's stomping it.  He's stomping it, too.  No, I'm really good with Darrell Jeter.  But he's a big Yankee fan.  No, no, no.  He's stupid.  I know what you mean.  He doesn't have the power to retain information.  There's Mr. Anderson.  Yeah.  There's Cano.  Mm-hmm.  There's Pettit.  See?  He's going to the bullpen.  Yeah.  You know we're giving you a quiz that we would give an eight-year-old, right? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I know.  I'm just, I'm just, I'm really good with this stuff.  You're not.  I am.  No, I am.  You're the opposite of good.  I'm just drawing a blank whenever I come in this room.  Ew.  Ew, that's right.  What the fuck?  All right, so you're a big baseball fan.  I think he proved that.  Yes.  I think he proved that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is really stupid.  He is.  He's so stupid.  He can't retain any information. 
[03:30:00]  You're really dumb.  No, he's a Laker fan.  He knows Kobe Bryant.  Do you know the Lakers are still in it?  They're not.  All right.  How do you know?  Yeah.  Do you know?  I do know.  Do you?  Yeah.  Who knocked him out?  Who did knock him out?  Did he ask you?  I don't know.  I just know they're not in it.  All right.  Wow.  That is a stupid response. 
[03:30:30]  Guy was telling me that they have a game tonight.  They start the Western Conference finals tonight.  You're wearing the shirt.  You are really, really stupid.  Out of all the teams, there's four that are still in it, and they're one.  And you're wearing the shirt.  You were wrong when you were asked about the Lakers.  And then when I said, do you know, and you said yes, you were also wrong about that.  So you're a fan of the Lakers and Kobe Bryant, but you didn't know they were out. 
[03:31:00]  Or you thought they were out.  I thought they were out.  And you're a fan of the Yankees, and you sort of named a few players.  I'm watching this season.  Nope.  He's so stupid.  Yeah, he is.  Anything else?  No, I don't have anything.  You're a big baseball fan.  What place are the Yankees in right now?  They're in second.  Who's in first?  The Tampa Bay Rays are. 
[03:31:30]  I don't know.  And last are the Orioles.  Third are the Red Sox.  He has the start of being the Rain Man, and then he falls apart.  He's Rain Man without any of the genius part of Rain Man Man.  Which is just a retard.  Right.  You think he's going to rattle off some stuff where you're like, holy shit, and then it's  just fucking the wheels fall off.  Here comes the savant part.  But no, we only get idiot.  He looks at toothpicks and just goes, they fell. 
[03:32:00]  Doesn't think they count them.  He's just like Rain Man, except all of his facts are wrong.  Like if Rain Man miscounted toothpicks all the time.  He just has the hot water burn baby part.  I actually have a story about Mitch Faitel.  Oh, here we go.  You kind of sound like him a little bit.  A little bit.  Liam.  By the way, the video of the girls dancing, we did that.  We were way ahead of this fucking video.  Oh, of course.  With the seven, eight-year-olds doing the fucking hiney dance.  Yeah. 
[03:32:30]  They're playing everywhere today.  Because now there's outrage, I guess.  Yeah, we started that whole fucking thing.  What are you going to tell?  I got to love buzz.  Yeah, Liam told me that Mitch Faitel was in.  And you've told me that I sound like Mitch Faitel, so I wanted to meet him.  So he told me, wait by the elevators, because Mitch Faitel will be, he'll be coming out of Howard's wing.  So I get a text from intern Charlie.  He was asking me something about work.  What was he asking about work? 
[03:33:00]  I don't remember what he asked me.  How does it pertain to the story?  Well, no, no.  Because I look down at the text really quick.  Holy shit.  And Mitch Faitel passes right by me.  And the elevator door closes.  And I go to try.  That's the story?  No, I wonder what happened to me.  Come on, Sam.  Sorry.  And when I go to maybe get the door open, he keeps on pushing the buttons to maybe get the elevator to open.  And it just doesn't open.  And he's like, sorry. 
[03:33:30]  And that's it.  That's what happened.  If you have to say, and that's it.  Oh, by the way, the Red Sox are in fourth place.  Thank you, J.D. in New York City.  So you got that wrong, too.  That was your Mitch Faitel story?  Yeah.  He just passed by me.  It's my chance to meet him.  He's Mitch Faitel.  Wow.  Probably be up again.  This kid works better than warm milk, though.  I'm all sleepy. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he's like.  His stupidity is just intoxicating.  He is stupid.  Any other stories?  That was pretty good.  I don't really have.  If I tell a story, it's just not going to be interesting.  Well, last time Mick Foley was here, I got to meet Mick Foley.  I actually got to talk to him for about an hour or so.  And I do the show rundowns.  Yeah.  An hour?  Yeah.  I don't know why he's bothering our guests. 
[03:34:30]  That's a fireable offense.  Yeah.  That is a fireable intern offense, by the way.  Well, I was working on something, and he sat next to me, so.  What are you working on?  Well, I was working on editing the show rundown, and he wanted to use my computer.  We're listening.  Well, he wanted to use my computer, and he ended up deleting all the work I had done that  morning.  Probably did it because you bugged him.  Well, he started talking to me.  In the beginning, I didn't talk.  What were you talking about with Mick Foley? 
[03:35:00]  He's a very interesting guy.  He's got a lot of good stories.  He was talking about, uh, he had done a show.  I don't know.  Some woman was the host of it.  I forgot what show it was.  And he was just telling me about that.  What's your favorite Mick Foley memory?  Wait.  That was the end of your story?  That's his Mick Foley story.  That was your Mick Foley story.  His stories are the dullest.  Jimmy is officially sleeping. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, Jimmy is just, he put his head on the mic.  He's just taking a snooze.  Do you realize what you've done?  Wait, your Mick Foley story is he was telling you about being on a show where there was a  female host.  Well, I don't remember what show ended.  But that's where the story ended.  That's the setup, usually.  What are you talking about?  I just met Mick Foley.  He was one of my heroes growing up.  We got that part. 
[03:36:00]  Wow.  Wow.  That's all I could say is wow.  There's a female host of the show.  I don't know if you.  Yeah.  And I figured there'd be more info after that or more story after that.  Right.  Not with Love Buzz.  That's where it ends.  He's his hero.  He told me about a show he was on where there was a female host.  I'm stunned.  He could retell the Mitch Fatale took an elevator downstairs story.  That was a good one. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  That at least was a great story.  We need more stories like that.  Do you want me to retell it for you guys?  No.  Shut up.  Just shut up.  No.  That would be bad.  All right.  I think he rates right up there.  I told you he might be the stupidest intern.  He could be out of all the ones you've mentioned.  The top ones through history.  He gets food orders wrong a semester in. 
[03:37:00]  Three months.  Yeah.  It's not new stuff.  God damn.  Why is that hard again?  Because you've got to keep track of the money?  I don't want to mess up the money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the important part.  Forget about getting the order right.  Yeah.  So just don't even take the order.  Yeah.  I don't want to worry about the money.  But how could the money be complicated?  It's not.  How is that complicated?  It's not complicated.  I just don't want to bring people back the wrong change.  We all did it. 
[03:37:30]  It's fairly easy.  All right.  Well, he's wearing a Lakers jersey, but he didn't know that the Lakers are playing tonight,  even though there's only four teams left.  Kobe.  And he knows Kobe Bryant.  And he knows Derek Jeter.  Yes.  He knows some of the most famous athletes on the planet.  Sports guy.  But he's a big baseball guy.  He is.  But he doesn't watch because he's got a three-day-a-week internship.  So you're going to be the head intern? 
[03:38:00]  Yes, I am.  I'm saying make him the head intern.  So who said it?  You have to.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to.  Right now.  Make an official.  You know why?  Because a new crop of interns will come in.  You make him head intern, and they'll all be, in no time, they'll be like, he is the dumbest  motherfucker, and I have to listen to him.  And we have one other intern sticking around because he's only been here for half a semester.  After Dustin, who's the bald, red-headed guy that wants to get a tattoo on the air.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  He wants a wild tattoo on his head or something?  On the back of his head. 
[03:38:30]  That's cool.  Yeah, that's good.  That, you know, lasts a lifetime.  Love Buzz is going to be his boss, though.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  How are you going to, like, set the rules and stuff?  You got anything in mind?  Because you can't just be the head intern.  You've got to actually, like, do stuff.  Leadership.  Leadership.  Thank you, Sam.  You've got to put your foot down immediately.  How are you going to do that?  Oh, God damn it.  Okay.  See, what ends up happening is... 
[03:39:00]  What?  The proverbial students will become the teacher.  This is the leadership that they're...  Yeah.  Yeah, how are you going to put your foot down?  You can't just be lead intern.  You're not going to have respect.  And if you don't, uh...  If you don't respect...  If the people don't respect you, you're fucked.  You need managing skills.  Like, what's your management, like, skill set or something?  You know what I mean?  Like, what do you expect from the interns below you?  I expect them to work very hard. 
[03:39:30]  And to their fullest potential.  Don't worry, Sam.  I got this.  All right.  Continue.  Good.  I'm not worried.  Okay.  That's it.  That's the whole...  He was talking to you when he said continue.  You know what?  Andy, very mad, because he's all caps.  He goes, how the fuck can you be a bald, red-headed kid?  But we all understood what you meant by that.  Exactly.  It wasn't even questioned.  So, uh... 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Love Buzz.  Hey.  What are you going to teach the new interns?  Jimmy, you gave up on this?  I don't blame you.  It's fucking...  It's like white noise.  Well, that's half hour.  It's been...  And why the name Love Buzz?  Because Chrissy in Iowa needs to know.  Well, Love Buzz was my email.  And Love Buzz happens to be my favorite Nirvana song. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Wait, so did you get the email?  Theme music.  Wait, did you hear how he said that?  Well, my favorite...  My favorite song.  Coincidentally.  Yeah, coincidentally.  Nirvana made a song.  No, my favorite...  He had an email that was Love Buzz and Anthony.  No, no, no.  His favorite Nirvana song was Love Buzz.  Yeah.  My favorite Nirvana...  Not, I love Nirvana, and my favorite song is Love Buzz, so I decided to make an email  account stating that.  What?  Sorry.  Oh, you pretty much said it for me. 
[03:41:00]  He is so fucking stupid.  Really dumb.  I am beside myself...  Please say stupefied.  I love when you say that.  I'm stupefied.  Yeah.  You really are not a smart man.  You're not...  He's going to be running the intern program.  Yes, he will.  Yeah.  All the new interns will have to go through him before they can ask me questions.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My favorite intern moment of all time, by the way, because this is sort of where we're 
[03:41:30]  going with him, was when we made David in charge.  And then he had to give the rest of the intern reviews.  Oh, yeah.  Reviews.  Yes.  And he dressed up in a suit and tie.  In a suit and tie.  We sat up at a desk and he had no problem telling these guys what their problem.  He was great.  We sat him at a desk.  I miss him every day.  Yeah, Dave was the best.  You know who I saw him the other day?  You saw Intern David?  Yeah, it was...  Was he lending money?  Patrice was in. 
[03:42:00]  And Patrice was at this restaurant on Broadway in Times Square and I was walking home and  I went, fuck, Patrice.  You know, he was just on the show.  Whatever.  So I sat down with him and hung out with him a little bit.  Intern Dave walks by, stares me right in the eye, panics and runs away.  And he was all dressed up like he was going on an interview or something.  He probably didn't get the job.  Of course.  He's on his way home from an interview.  It didn't go well.  Are we done with Love Buzz for now?  He's not getting any smarter. 
[03:42:30]  No.  They did pretty good.  Love Buzz, wow.  He's the new guy.  He's the new...  Oh, welcome to the show.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  He's been here a full semester.  Oh, really?  He's the new head intern in charge.  Oh, oh.  I love the fact that he's wearing a Lakers shirt.  Didn't know the Lakers were playing tonight.  That's correct.  But he's a big fan.  Of Kobe.  I'm just a big fan of Kobe Bryant.  But wouldn't you, like, follow what he's up to?  Like, I don't know.  You didn't even know he was going to...  Getting closer to another championship?  He's going to be on television playing basketball tonight.  Yeah, you might want to tune in. 
[03:43:00]  Will you tune that in?  Probably not.  Why?  You're a fan.  He's so confusing.  Why aren't you going to watch him if you're a big fan and he's on TV tonight?  Oh, I'm going on a date tonight.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Mm-hmm.  With who?  This girl named Kelly.  She used to be friends with my ex-girlfriend, and I kind of met her through her.  And I'm going to take her to...  I thought you were going on a date with a pumpkin.  No, no, no, no.  It's actually a living, breathing thing. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, it is a living, breathing girl.  And where are you taking her?  I'm going to take her to Park Slope, Brooklyn.  It's where...  My dad used to have a pizza place there.  So I know the neighborhood.  I know some people there.  What happened to your dad's business?  Oh, he had to sell it.  The business kind of tanked.  Well, it didn't tank.  He was there for 10 years, and he couldn't...  How do you fuck up pizza?  In Brooklyn.  In Brooklyn.  No, no, no.  Because...  In Brooklyn, thanks to me.  In Brooklyn. 
[03:44:00]  How do you fuck up a pizza place in Brooklyn?  He was...  He was doing really good.  Just...  Well.  He was doing very well.  But then he decided that he had to make triangle pizzas or something, right?  No, it was...  He had to fuck it up, right?  He couldn't afford, like, the building expenses anymore.  He was doing well.  And...  Is he like you when they said you have to make pizza out of dough?  He was using money to make the pizza out of dough.  I may be a...  That was something.  You may be what?  I may be a dope, but my dad was very successful in that neighborhood. 
[03:44:30]  Maybe he was successful, but you definitely are a dope.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're taking this girl out.  That's good.  And what?  You know people there, so you're going to take her around so guys can fucking...  Yeah.  Why are you taking her there?  Cock block and pick up on her?  Yeah.  I just...  I like the neighborhood.  So what are you going to do?  I was going to take her, like, to Prospect Park.  That's good.  Yeah.  The rape park.  Is that a good park, Ann? 
[03:45:00]  I don't even know.  It's Rape Park.  Well, I'm not going to take her there at night.  That would just be weird.  Yeah.  When's your date?  Yeah, what time is this date?  Are you 30?  Right at 11 a.m.  I'll pick you up.  So you were interning today.  What's after this?  All right, so you're taking her to the park.  What are you going to do in the park?  Why am I trying?  Maybe going...  What am I doing?  What?  I know.  Go ahead.  Going like a picnic.  A picnic? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Is this 18 fucking 90s?  What are you doing?  I'm going to have a picnic.  Exactly.  And go to the carousel and the bandshell.  All right.  What kind of picnic?  Whatever I buy in the store.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Do you have a little picnic set up or what?  I have like a towel in my car.  Okay.  You know what?  I'll tell you what's going on here. 
[03:46:00]  We all want to end this, but it's so fascinating.  I'm really...  It's gone to...  I know it's a little slow probably.  It's going to be fascinating.  But all right.  You got a towel in your car for the picnic.  This segment started with Troy describing how he took this 20-year-old out to this wonderful  Brazilian steakhouse.  Yeah.  And took her to a jazz bar.  And now Love Buzz is saying he's going to go to the store and then eat on a towel in  Rake Park.  What kind of food are you going to get?  I guess cold cuts.  Whatever I could find. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  Cold cuts and a smelly fucking old towel that's in your car.  A towel.  A towel.  A towel.  It's horrendous.  That's great.  He uses it to clean the dipstick off when he checks his oil.  Just lay it on the ground.  Where'd you meet this girl?  Yeah.  Well, when I was going out with this other girl during the summer, it was just a mutual  friend thing.  And that's how I had met her.  The end.  I don't remember the exact point in time where I met her.  A lot of his stories should end with the end, so we know. 
[03:47:00]  The end.  Right.  Otherwise, it's just you guys waiting for him to continue.  All right.  I want to know more about the date.  Prospect Park.  You go there a lot?  Wow.  Did someone do the last one?  Yes.  That's a good one, Jimmy.  If no one's going to end this, I'll do it.  I love how Love Buzz's radio instincts are when there's silence in the room.  Not to talk. 
[03:47:30]  Just look around.  She's a very cute girl.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Got a picture?  It's her Facebook.  Pop it up.  Okay.  Give the address to Danny, but not, you know, not live.  No, not live.  So move away from the language.  Which means, yeah, go to Danny and key it in on the fucking keyboard.  Jesus Christ.  It's going to be a long one.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  What?  Is that in line?  Just type her name in.  Yes.  Just type her name in.  Holy Christ.  Let's see. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  Let's see.  Let's see what we got here.  That's a guy.  A guy.  A big bald guy came up.  It's a goal into mine.  What?  I could get so big.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  And you called it, Sam, saying this is going to take a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have to.  Are we in a round of fesses time because of our lack of breaks?  Just about.  Yeah, just about.  Yeah, we'll just take a look at this girl and see you.  And we want to end with man on the silver mountain for Ronnie James Dio today.  Yes. 
[03:48:30]  And we should do the live read and show.  And then we can end with.  Yeah, I'll do it right when he's doing this.  While he's doing that, July 2, 3, I'm at the Borgata.  Yes.  I have my stupid iPhone app.  And I'm on Mark Barrett's podcast, WTF pod, I think.  Give me one of those.  As of today.  I'll do it like Fezzy does it.  Like right in the middle.  Right in the middle of the show.  I'll just go.  Hey, by the way.  We got a picture of her.  Oh, that's her. 
[03:49:00]  Not bad.  A nice body.  All right.  I got a lot of artsy type pictures.  It's with this artistic.  Oh, yeah.  They'll love her in Prospect Park.  Nice body.  Nice rump.  All right.  You guys are going out on a picnic on your dirty towel.  That's great.  You're going to eat fucking, you're going to eat fucking pimento loaf and bologna.  It's cold cuts.  Yeah.  Is pimento loaf a fucking? 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  It's pretty bad.  It's a horrible cold cut, but it does classify.  Yeah, she's all right.  You're going to have sex with her, you think?  That means putting your penis in her vagina.  Well, we've already had sex before.  Oh, you've had sex with this girl?  All right.  Yeah.  Cool.  How does it work out for you?  Worked out very well.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's got to have a big dick.  He has to.  You got a big dick?  Hope so for his sake.  Jesus.  Nothing else going on.  I guess like seven or eight.  I mean, just three.  Yeah, that's a lot.
