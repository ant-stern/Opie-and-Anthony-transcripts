<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show's "After ONA Live" segment began with a discussion about the day's broadcast, specifically focusing on guest Ian Halperin and the "escorts" he brought.  The staff was divided on Halperin; Opie, Travis, and Troy enjoyed his provocative, sex-focused style, while Danny disliked him.  They agreed, however, that Halperin's contributions made for "good radio."  This led to Opie describing his belongings, prompting a joke about the need for a man-bag.

The conversation then shifted to a humorous anecdote about Mars being distracted by an attractive woman walking by during a segment featuring a teenage magician.  This was followed by Roland repeatedly playing a clip of himself laughing at E-Rock.  E-Rock's supposed vacation was mentioned, along with an upcoming schedule change: the show would lose an hour but gain a replay and a new time slot.

The segment continued with updates on several staff members: Eastside Dave's employment status was discussed, Jim Norton's appearance on CNN was noted, and Garrett's daily cannabis use and severe allergic reactions (including a recent ER visit) were detailed. The segment concluded with Opie's departure and a brief interaction with Garrett.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  How do you follow His Highness?  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And look who's still here.  Well, if it isn't Opie.  I'm just coming in to get my stuff, Sam.  Well, no, no, no, no, no. We're on live.  How sad does this place look? 
[00:00:30]  Well, I mean...  It had all that energy.  Exactly. A tornado just came through it.  We had great comics and Ian Halperin and his escorts.  Goddesses, I believe is what he called it.  Goddesses, bitches, hoes, whatever you want to call them.  And now, you got nothing.  It just clears out of here.  Yeah, the energy has completely left this room.  It's an empty room.  And all I'm doing is picking up my Clockwork Orange Blu-ray.  How come I didn't get a copy?  40th Anniversary Edition.  It looks cool.  And there's a digital copy. 
[00:01:00]  I love Blu-rays that come with digital copies.  You like the digital, huh?  Love it, because I put it on the iPad.  It's amazing.  I got my Atrix.  Okay.  I got my allergy medication.  I got my HD Flip.  I'm ready to go home.  Start my weekend.  You got a lot of stuff.  You need like a little man bag or something.  Oh, really?  I think so.  You got so much stuff, it'd be easier for you.  No, I'm not a man bag guy.  By the way, quickly.  Whoa.  What?  What happened?  Someone's writing.  How was the show today, Travis? 
[00:01:30]  Ian Halperin was here.  How do you think it was?  Exactly.  You don't understand.  The staff is divided on a lot of things.  Ian Halperin is certainly one of the big ones.  Travis and me are both on the pro-Ian Halperin side.  I couldn't be a bigger fan of Ian Halperin coming in.  And look at the radio that we got.  Yeah, the people that write and go, I'd rather hear Bobo.  Really?  Get out of here.  I think people love to listen in on that shit, because it's so frustrating.  It's annoying.  It is funny.  Ian Halperin always brings it down to who's had more sex. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  He's just a kid.  He's just having high school arguments.  Yeah, and he always goes with that gay sex thing.  That's his thing.  That's his fucking go-to material.  I think Travis, me, and Troy are the only people left on the staff who are Ian Halperin fans.  I think Danny's a fan.  No, Danny hates him.  In a way where it's not good for the show?  Danny recognizes, I think, he can come down and talk about it if he wants to, but Danny  recognizes that it's entertainment for the show.  Well, that's all we care about.  But on a personal level, he hates me and Halperin. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah, I get that.  I believe he hates me and Halperin.  I could never hang out with that guy.  I was hanging out with him for like a half hour before the show.  Right.  Just inflating his ego.  Yeah.  Because he is the man.  There's Danny.  Do you like Ian Halperin on the show?  I don't give a fuck if he's on the show.  But do you understand it's good radio?  Yeah, I understand what it does for the show.  What is this?  Like a fucking...  What I walk into.  No, we're talking about who likes Ian Halperin.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people...  I don't have to like him because he's on the show, right?  No.  It's okay if you don't like him.  I said I don't like him. 
[00:03:00]  I don't have an opinion with it.  I thought I was about to get in trouble for not liking Ian Halperin.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't have an opinion about him personally, but I understand that it's great for the fucking  show.  I was just saying that like Travis, me, and Troy are still in the bandwagon where we are  fans.  Put it this way, when Ian Halperin gets booked for the show, I don't go, oh, come on, let's  not book Ian Halperin.  I just go, oh, fuck.  Because it's exhausting.  Yeah.  But I don't go, I don't think we should be booking that guy.  I just go, oh, Ian Halperin.  That's all I want to know. 
[00:03:30]  Me and Travis are like...  I don't care about him personally.  I know he's going to be here no matter what I think.  Travis and me are doing jumping jacks because he's coming in.  Why is Troy the kiss ass?  Why are you kissing his ass?  I love him.  I think he's fucking great.  But you love him as a person?  I think he's awesome.  On every level.  Yeah.  I think he's great.  On every level.  Comes in with hot chicks, delivers radio gold.  Those are escorts, most likely.  His Highness doesn't need escorts.  Anyone can roll like that.  Yeah.  Because they're probably not even high-end escorts.  You think they're more towards the lower tier?  Nah, they're like probably... 
[00:04:00]  I mean, I don't know this world.  I really don't.  It's probably, though, middle of the road.  Middle of the road.  Definitely not like the higher high...  Like, not a spitzer type of girl.  No.  Right.  No, those are middle of the road.  I would have fucked both of them.  You would?  Well...  Yeah, but you almost fucked Ian that day.  You were naked in a bed with him.  That is true.  Yeah.  Dude, they're hot, and he delivers radio...  Dude.  But you actually like him.  Oh, he's a cool guy.  You would hang out with him.  Travis, help me out.  See, here's the difference.  I think Troy and Sam are probably the only people who would actually...  Hang out with him?  ...leave this building and go hang out with him. 
[00:04:30]  You and I...  Hell fucking no.  It ends here.  If Ian Halperin said to me, hey, Sam, I'm going to get something to eat.  Do you want to come with me?  I'd be like, yes!  Of course I do!  I'd be right there with you.  Yeah.  Let me grab Troy.  Why?  Because I just like to hear him talk.  Like, he just...  Oh, he's entertaining as all hell in a weird way.  He's delusional.  Yeah.  He's living in some sort of other world.  He thinks his comebacks are great.  And Kurt Metzger and Jeffries were frustrated by that, but that's what I think is great about him.  Who should have seen...  Because his comebacks are so lame and so old school, like, we're all 13 years old again. 
[00:05:00]  Him and I had a conversation...  Buttsack, by the way.  Buttsack O'Neal.  Buttsack.  Him and I had a conversation right after he left.  Yeah.  And he was saying, how did I do, Sam?  Were the phones lighting up?  Did I do all right?  Did I do great?  And I said, yeah, man.  The phones were going crazy.  The segment was unbelievable.  Yeah, he's all right.  He's the man.  He's a hype machine in a weird way.  All right.  I got to go, man.  Didn't you have a...  What?  You wanted to talk...  I wanted to talk to you about your YouTube.  Why?  New stuff going up on YouTube?  Well...  Oh, I do have something, actually. 
[00:05:30]  You know the teenagers with their magic tricks?  Yeah, yeah.  Videos came out okay, but I like looking at other shit that's going on in my videos, and  I hope that other shit is happening.  Right.  I like to have layers to my videos.  So is this...  So you know the teenage kid that was doing the balloon in the cell phone?  Yes.  Or the cell phone in the balloon, right?  We all got that wrong yesterday.  Cell phone goes in the balloon.  So the kid's doing the trick, and you guys told Mars to mic him.  Yeah.  So Mars' whole job was to make sure the kid had a microphone so he could talk his way through 
[00:06:00]  his magic trick.  So we could hear the kid.  His illusion, right?  All of a sudden, a booty girl walks by the window in the background.  Oh, I know who that was.  Mars completely loses focus, forgets he's on the Open Anthony show, almost breaks his  neck to turn to check out the girl.  And has no idea who's being mic'd or not.  Completely got caught.  Oh, my God.  And I go to Mars in the bathroom this morning, and I explain what I just said to you, and  he goes, I'm starting to fucking hate that camera a few years. 
[00:06:30]  Because he also got caught going crazy when J-Lo walked by on your camera.  Like, you were just trying to film J-Lo, and all of a sudden, Mars is acting like a baby  whatever.  Yeah, and he was trying to impress Patrice, like Patrice was going to give him something.  Like he was a cool guy.  Yeah, me and you, Patrice.  And Patrice is like, get the fuck out of here.  Patrice is so cool, he's not going to give you anything.  He's going to check out the nice J-Lo ass, but he's not going to lose it like Mars did.  Because he's a cool guy, and now...  So I don't know.  If you haven't seen the video, or you have, you might want to check out Mars getting caught  looking at some booty ass.  Video evidence of Mars' poor work ethic. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Basically, you forgot.  Just concentrating...  Just like that.  On whoever, whatever...  I think I know who it was.  Because I think she actually works there.  When does Ronnie get here?  If I wait five more minutes, I could do some radio with Ronnie?  Yeah, he usually...  When did he break in?  I mean, yesterday he broke in early.  He was here at like 38 after the hour.  Oh, wow.  But, I mean, it could be any time between now and five minutes from now.  Yeah, I can't wait.  I want to talk to him about the Justin Bartha thing.  That was a weird thing.  Yeah, I feel bad that we didn't have that clip yesterday. 
[00:07:30]  I didn't even put two and two together, because I remember it going down on Ron and Fez,  but I just had no idea that him and...  That that was Justin Bartha.  Yeah, that was really uncomfortable, which I love.  Roland?  Yes?  What are you doing?  Come on in, buddy.  You got something for me?  No, no, this is for something else.  What is it?  This is a Dazzner movie.  What is it?  A Dazzner.  Let me see it.  Why should that Opie have it?  Because that's for another...  Oh, he threw it in the garbage. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, that's a nice picker.  You're a garbage picker.  Did you hear Roland laughing at E-Rock, his best friend?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  It's getting played out, Sam.  I don't think so.  Why, you got more?  No, I've been playing the same clip.  Every day?  Yeah, a minute and a half of Roland laughing at Eric.  Wasn't he supposed to come back today?  He's back in town.  Well, he should have came and did the show then.  He figured he'd take a day to himself.  He's fucking lazy, man.  He is a lazy guy.  So his work is over?  Uh, E-Rock's?  Yeah, we all take vacation. 
[00:08:30]  He takes work?  E-Rock takes work because when he's here...  So he took one of his work weeks?  Yeah, I guess so.  Because now he's on vacation.  He'll be back on Monday for more vacation right here.  Oh, okay.  So he starts back up on vacation Monday.  Be careful what you say.  He'll call you at home.  No, no, no, no.  You don't want that.  I'm done with that.  Yeah, totally.  This is going nowhere, Sam.  It's obvious.  Ronnie will save you, though.  Thank God for that.  Thank you for stopping by, Roland.  Why did you make a farting sound?  I don't know.  You don't know.  We want to see what you can do without anybody else around, Sam. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you told me I had to throw to clips.  I was about to throw to a clip.  What clip?  Fuck Twat the Clown is played by Eastside Dave, who was discussed on the show today.  It's just a short one.  I mean, we don't have a lot of time.  Because we got no time because you guys decided to go late.  So then we're left with, you know, a couple minutes.  What can I grab?  I'll give you some Eastside Dave stuff.  Hold on, man.  Because I know you love stirring the shit. 
[00:09:30]  Let me see what I got here.  He's my co-host, Eastside Dave, on Saturdays.  And yeah, Eastside Dave did want me to tell you guys.  Fuck, Jim Norton just made CNN?  I didn't know that.  Perhaps known best as a co-host of the Open Anthony Show.  And Sirius Norton is another fine example of a completely self-loathing comedian.  That's all I got on it.  It's an article called Jim Norton.  I'm dangerous.  That's terrific.  He is dangerous.  This is what I got on Eastside Dave.  He texted me the other day.  Let me see.  He wanted me to tell Anthony, who keeps saying that he was fired and that Sirius let him go. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  He still works for Sirius.  Not really.  He's here every Saturday and gets paid to be here.  So is Earl.  What?  What?  Earl left.  You said, this is Eastside Dave.  You said to contact you if I'm feeling screwed.  Okay.  Well, this is it, Opie.  We fucking rocked this shit and they take away an hour?  Fuck them.  Oh, boy.  You guys lost an hour of your show?  Well, that's...  Yes.  I mean, not as of...  In two weeks, we will. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, when the new thing happens?  Yeah.  Does a new thing happen?  There's your tease, ladies and gentlemen.  But we're also getting moved up an hour, so it's not all bad.  Are you losing an hour?  We're losing an hour.  So how much Sam and Dave have you got to do?  Two hours instead of three.  Oh, that kind of sucks.  Well, we lose an hour, but we move up an hour and we're going to gain a replay.  So...  Oh, so you actually make out on the deal.  That's what I think.  That's what I told Dave.  I think you make out on the deal.  Yeah.  Moving up an hour is good for you guys.  Definitely.  I mean, we should be moving up a lot more than an hour.  When are we making the announcement?  I don't know, but...  A little news for the channel coming soon. 
[00:11:00]  It's going to be a very memorial...  I'm the king of the radio tease.  And you leave now.  Or you go on Troy Kwan's Facebook.  Roland is the king of ruining teases.  He just fucked up your tease.  It's on Troy Kwan's Facebook?  No, it's not.  Roland was just trying to do something funny that nobody got.  Roland ruined your tease.  There's Garrett!  Listen.  Garrett!  Come on in!  Opie Radio on Twitter.  I'll give away the news.  Oh, wow.  It's going to be tweeted.  And as Opie leaves, awesome Garrett comes in.  Oh, come say hi to Garrett. 
[00:11:30]  What are you leaving for?  He used to work for you, and you just walk out without even saying a word to him.  Is this...  Garrett, is this the relationship you had with him?  I had a nice conversation with Opie today.  Not just now.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, you're ruining the mystique.  I was ruining the mystique of something I said on the air, you dumbass.  People can put this shit together.  They're really smart out there.  So, did you...  You just walked by with...  Did you still get high?  Yeah.  I love people that are honest, really?  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  As much as you used to?  Nah, still every day, though.  Every day?  Yeah.  That's a lot of high-in.  It is.  I like it.  Does it still have the same effect?  It does.  You know, I moved up to the stronger stuff, but...  Good for you.  What?  Heron?  No, no, no.  Are you on heroin, Garrett?  Just, I mean, the stronger weed.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do they drug test around here?  No.  Yeah, you wouldn't last a week if they did.  Well, that'd be really hypocritical, right?  Yeah.  Huh.  It's good that you're goal-oriented.  I'm starting to think about it, but I'm allergic to grass and trees, so I've got to ask my 
[00:12:30]  ologists if I can get high.  I'm going to really ask them.  Hey, can I smoke some weed?  Would that be cool?  Yeah.  Will that affect my allergies?  I'm not even joking.  Well, what's the worst that could happen?  How allergic are you?  I'm allergic to grass and trees.  But do you just start sneezing or do your lungs close?  Every piece of grass and every piece of tree that you come across.  It's not a particularly kind.  He said every tree and grass I'm allergic to.  But is it like a fatal allergy or do you just get sneezy? 
[00:13:00]  What do you think?  You see me every morning bitching and complaining.  I admit on the air that I know you guys don't like when I bitch, but I can't help it.  These allergies are killing me.  But it's not fatal, though, so maybe just smoke a little weed and find out.  I've had a couple incidences.  Incidences?  That was a little tough to say.  Or I ended up in the ER.  So it is fatal.  I'm just asking you a question.  You want to tell me yes or no?  Yeah, but that, I think, might be from some kind of food thing.  I don't know.  We've got to find out if you're...  I know I'm allergic to apples.  But my brother had to get me to... 
[00:13:30]  So you can't smoke out of an apple bong, then?  No, no, no, no, no.  I told the story.  I woke up looking like I was a fighter with my eyes just about...  Yeah, and big, huge fucking knots all over my head.  And I learned later if I would have taken an aspirin for the horrific headache I had, that could have caused my death.  Wow.  Well...  And instead I called my brother and he got me to the emergency room.  And of course I had to sign out...  I had to do all the paperwork before they saw me.  You really are a bubble boy.  Even though I couldn't even fucking see at that point.  And then they got some shit that they don't want to give us that they fucking put in... 
[00:14:00]  They put something in the IV.  My brother watched my face go back to normal in front of his eyes.  Wow.  How creepy is that?  How can they just fix you?  Like, that can't be healthy.  It was a major dose of Benadryl, I guess, or something.  And then they had something.  I had the worst headache of my life when I was in this situation.  They gave me something.  I think that was in the IV as well.  That made the worst headache of my life go away within...  Don't want to exaggerate. 
[00:14:30]  Within a minute.  Jeez.  Why didn't they give it to us?  I don't know.  Why didn't they just put it in CVS?  I don't know.  Fooling around with this Tylenol, you know, extra strength bullshit is nothing.  They got some shit.  Got the headache to go away within a minute or so.  Not much more than a minute.  And my face go back to normal in front of my brother's eyes.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  You know how you were trying to leave and stuff?  Body's here?  I know.  I just got you to stay for the whole show.  It's all over now.  Why does it smell like Old Spice in here?  It must have been His Highness Sir Ian Halperin.  Oh, that makes sense. 
[00:15:00]  I love you.  You know that.  Me too.  What, do you have to walk out because the show is ending so you have to walk out before  the show ends?  Oh, yeah.  Why can't you just be polite and like stick around?  Because I always have to stay at the end.  It's nice to know that I can leave before a show ends.  This has been After Opie and Anthony's Live.
