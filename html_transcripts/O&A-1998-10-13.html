<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Opie recounting outrageous high school stories, including alleged encounters with Nicole Brown Simpson and Boomer Esiason (whom he claimed to have punched, injuring his own arm).  The hosts then transitioned to a humorous segment dedicated to a pedestrian hit by a van outside Bloomingdale's, even composing a mock song about the incident.  A listener's question about sleeping with Jennifer Lopez sparked a discussion about her physique, accompanied by a rendition of Sir Mix-a-Lot's "Baby Got Back."  They then excitedly discussed an upcoming Yankees game, anticipating aggressive fan interactions, particularly targeting Cleveland Indians fans.

A major portion of the broadcast was devoted to a phone interview with Joe Pesci, promoting his new CD featuring songs performed as his Cousin Vinny character, including a rap song titled "Wise Guy," parts of which he performed live on air.  The hosts' reaction ranged from amusement to disbelief, leading to a playful yet somewhat tense exchange with Pesci, who also mentioned an upcoming in-store signing at HMV.  Following the interview, the hosts discussed music from their youth (Rush, Eagles, Van Halen, Molly Hatchett) before Errol announced the cancellation of the first two weeks of the NBA season.  This news triggered a discussion about crime rates, racial demographics in the NBA, and a controversial anecdote involving Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder's racially charged commentary.  The conversation then shifted to a hypothetical all-female NBA league comprised of supermodels in revealing outfits, generating further suggestive comments from the hosts.

Next, the hosts interviewed Sandra Margo, a self-proclaimed former porn star promoting her video "The Sex Lies of the Stars," which purportedly contained explicit footage of various celebrities.  Margo detailed alleged sexual encounters and preferences of several celebrities, including Jack Nicholson, Jerry Seinfeld, Axl Rose, and Larry King.  The interview was marked by highly suggestive and vulgar questions and commentary from Opie and Anthony.

The show concluded with a return to the Yankees game discussion, including a listener calling in to detail their plan to throw toy water guns onto the field.  They also shared a humorous anecdote about Scott Muni's on-air sign-off, read a fax expressing disappointment with WNEW radio's programming, and concluded with a humorous imagined conversation with John Glenn in space, focusing on the effects of zero gravity on his body.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous songs were played, including selections from The Dave Matthews Band, The Rolling Stones, The Ramones, Aerosmith, Stone Temple Pilots, Talking Heads, Eric Clapton, R.E.M., U2, and Led Zeppelin.  The final segment also included further ribbing of Opie's technical difficulties (VCR and printer problems), and a recap of a "Fanatic" episode featuring a high school senior meeting the band Hanson.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, yeah, he's in prison.  What about this guy?  Oh, yeah, he's dead.  He hit a pole or something.  Like, everyone I knew was dead or in jail.  That's great.  I'm John Glenn.  Wonderful.  But you did go to high school when you went out to California with Nicole Brown Simpson.  Well, I was a freshman in Dana Hills High School, and she was a senior.  So you guys were in the same hallways, right?  Yeah.  Do you remember her at all back then?  Yeah, she'd date the big black football players.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  Way back then she was doing that.  Exactly.  Interesting.  Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  And then she hooked up with O.J., and we all know how that ended up.  The rest is history, yes.  Yeah.  And you also went to school with Boomer Esiason, but that was grammar school online.  Yes, yes, that's true.  I forgot about that, right?  Boomer, back in Timber Point Elementary School in East Islip.  Very good.  I called him Norman, and he called me out for a fight.  And you broke your arm, punched him in Boomer.  I punched him in the head.  I got the first punch in, and I broke my arm on his head.  When are we going to have Boomer on so we can confront him with beating up Anthony?  Yeah.  Did he pummel you after you broke your arm trying to punch him? 
[00:01:00]  Well, I remember the big thing when you got in a fight as a kid was, you know, you go,  come on, man.  You rip your jacket off.  Mm-hmm.  Because the first thing you do is take your jacket off.  You're ready to brawl.  I had one of those big, like, snorkel jackets.  I was like Kenny from South Park.  I couldn't even see my head.  And I figured this will add some padding.  Yeah.  So I'm zipping up.  I didn't even take it off.  So I'm there like a big, the Michelin man, you know, come on.  And I threw a punch and hit him right in the top of the head.  And you broke your arm. 
[00:01:30]  Did it knock him down or anything?  Nah.  I think he laughed.  God.  Was he wearing his football helmet when you hit him in the head?  Big guy.  Big bonehead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to get Boomer on the show.  We should.  So you can confront him.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I got a song for the guy that got hit by the car outside Bloomy's yesterday.  Oh, the van?  Yeah.  The next song we play will be for him.  How's that?  Okay.  So that will make people stick around.  Poor guy.  And the fax line is 212-957-WNEW. 
[00:02:00]  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony on Two for Tuesday.  We get back into the tunes with the Dave Matthews Band.  And here's Crash Into Me.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with the Dave Matthews Band.  That's Crush and Crash Into Me.  Before that, Jennifer's getting complaints because we sent that song out to the guy that...  Did he buy it outside Bloomingdale's yesterday?  Well, Opie, I believe he was seriously injured.  Which is very tragic, but that's...  You shouldn't see the brunt of your joke. 
[00:02:30]  Your little funny little crashing car joke.  I don't think it was funny.  I was just dedicating a song to the guy as he recuperates in the hospital.  That's all.  All right.  You know?  You've got to expect this stuff if you're a tourist coming to New York.  Things will fall out of the sky.  There will be mad men with guns shooting every once in a while.  It's like playing the lottery when you come to this fine city.  Poor guy.  He's just probably standing in front of the damn Bloomingdales taking pictures of his family.  Yeah.  From Ohio.  Yeah.  Hey, this is wonderful, honey. 
[00:03:00]  Why don't you just stand back a little bit?  I'm going to take a picture.  Here you go.  You're in frame.  You look great.  Yeah, smile for me, dear.  The relatives are going to love this one.  Yeah, what?  What?  Look at...  What?  Whoa!  Oh, my God!  Poor guy.  Only from Ohio to get hit by a bus or a van.  That's horrible.  It is.  You're absolutely horrible.  You were the one that played the crashing sound.  I'm not pushing the buttons today. 
[00:03:30]  Prove that I'm pushing the buttons for the car crash, Anthony.  I guess I can't.  That's right.  You can't prove that.  Alex in Jersey.  Yeah.  Fine.  Maybe not Mariah.  I was speaking earlier about whether you would do Mariah Carey.  She's on the cover of Vibe looking pretty good.  And says, especially because of the Puffy factor.  Yeah.  You don't like the idea that she slept with Puffy.  No.  All right?  No, I don't.  But the rumor about Puffy and Jennifer Lopez were true.  Could you honestly say you wouldn't sleep with Jennifer Lopez? 
[00:04:00]  Jennifer Lopez?  Yeah.  You want me to be honest?  Yeah.  Her butt's way too big for me.  Can't get past that big butt.  Really?  And I love how a lot of celebrities in Hollywood, you know, make believe that it's a real sexy butt.  No, that's a huge butt.  Baby's got back.  I need my butt song for that.  Really?  Yes.  Because I haven't really noticed.  You haven't noticed her butt?  No.  Rent any Jennifer Lopez movie.  All right. 
[00:04:30]  90% of the time, they will not show the butt.  They might bring in the stunt butt.  Or it's actually someone else's butt playing a part of Jennifer Lopez's butt.  But that butt is huge.  I'm going to pop a few pictures up on the computer and check it out.  Are you?  Yeah, I want to say.  I like big butts and I can't lie.  I like big butts and I can't lie.  I just don't like big butts. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Jennifer Lopez song.  Yeah.  All right.  So I guess I would have to pass on Jennifer Lopez as well.  All right.  Any other questions, Anthony, before we move on today?  No, that was just from Alex in Jersey.  I'm kind of full of angst.  I think I need to be at the Yankee game tonight because I think I could throw out some great abuse.  Man, they are saying that they've been interviewing people, you know, that are going to the game up in the Bronx.  And, man, they're angry. 
[00:05:30]  They're ready.  They're chomping at the bit and just ready to unload.  Yeah, I just hope NBC shows some fine shots of the crowd because there's going to be some great signs of flying tonight at the stadium.  Who's going to be the poor dope wearing the Indians hat?  Oh.  Sitting there.  Go Cleveland.  He's going to get so much beer poured on him.  Pummeled.  If you wear an Indians jersey during the regular season, you get beer poured on you.  Imagine what's going to happen to that guy tonight.  That'll be fun to watch. 
[00:06:00]  And Kony is going to take care of the series tonight without a doubt.  Good.  I just hope the rain holds out.  What's the deal with the rain?  We might actually have to do a weather forecast today because it's very important.  We've got to know if it's going to rain.  Yes.  So, all right.  I don't know.  I'll punch that up, too.  I'm online, Opie.  So, what are you going to do?  You're going to punch up pictures of Jennifer Lopez to decide if she's hot or not?  Yeah, I'm going to say.  She is very hot.  Don't get me wrong, but the butt is huge.  I just want to see if your butt diagnosis is correct.  And at this point in my life, I really shouldn't be picky, but I guess I am picky. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  All right.  On the way, it's two for Tuesday.  We've got a couple from the Stones and coming back with the Ramones.  Stay there.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with the Ramones.  Sheena is a punk rocker, and I want to be sedated.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right.  And what do you think, Anthony?  Am I right with my Jennifer Lopez big butt thing?  As I glance at pages and pages of Jennifer Lopez pictures on Alfonso Pinero's website. 
[00:07:00]  Wow, what a surprise.  You are right, Opie.  Yes.  I give you props.  Yeah.  Look at this one especially.  I don't like my Hollywood starless with big butts.  Whoa.  This must be from the Selena movie.  Yes.  She is packed into these white stretch pants where her butt is very bulbous coming out.  Look, I'm tracing it with the cursor.  Let's see that. 
[00:07:30]  Very bulbous.  You're like John Madden.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Well, look at the rear end here.  Bam!  Look at this, too.  Look.  Oh, she's smuggling a yo-yo.  Smuggling a Dunkin' Butterfly yo-yo, I would think, in there, in the front of those.  They're a little too tight there, Jennifer.  Jennifer, I think we can see what you had for lunch.  That's a big butt.  You're right.  It all fairs to her, though.  She had to gain weight for that movie.  Oh.  Well, all right.  Then let me go now to Galleria 3 on the page. 
[00:08:00]  Galleria.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Wait a minute.  This might be from the same movie, but look at those hips.  Yeah, there you go.  Them's childbearing hips.  There you go.  All right.  Let me check this one out.  I mean, I'm pretty pathetic, but I don't think I'd want her.  Now they're just shortchanging us from any below-the-hip shots.  Well, it's pretty funny, because as I glance at the photos, just about every one of the  photos ends at her waist.  At her waist.  They know what's going on down there. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, come on, man.  What?  What about this one?  A little dark.  Yeah, you can't see.  Of course not.  She wears the dark black dress.  Is it dark background?  You don't know where the night begins and the butt ends.  Well, some...  In her defense, some ethnic types like the big ass.  That's fine.  Do I look like an ethnic type to you?  You look Aryan.  Yeah, I do look Aryan.  And you know what?  Yeah.  I had some racism happen to me over the weekend.  You did?  Yeah.  I went to Chinatown. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you go for pork?  What do you go for?  Pork Chang Fang?  Or Lang Chang Fang Park?  There's so much pork being sold down there, it's not even funny.  Pork!  It's like the streets of Hanoi down there.  Is it?  But the point I want to make is, I haven't been to Chinatown in a very long time, and  I decided to go down there.  A bunch of us went down there.  And we decided to choose a Chinese restaurant.  And every restaurant I walked into, the whole place would turn around and look at me. 
[00:09:30]  Because look at me.  I know.  I'm ridiculous.  They're used to like the black hair.  Yeah, the blonde hair, the blue eyes.  I don't have the Three Stooges haircut.  I'm out of place here.  So we finally pick a restaurant.  Okay?  The Young Tongues!  And there was some definite racism going on.  A lot of people think racism is white against black or white against any minority.  That's not true.  It's whoever is the minority at the time.  Wow, and that was you.  It's the front of racism.  So I'm sitting there, and I'm watching table after table sit down after us, being served 
[00:10:00]  without a waiter coming up to us.  Oh, no, really?  And I'm starting to get the hand, and they finally, you know, send some guy over.  He's like, all right, what's your water?  What do you want, around I?  I mean, what do you want?  Try to chung, chung, chung, chung, chung.  Exactly.  And I just was treated horribly.  And there was a huge mirror, so I could see the whole dining hall.  Yeah.  And I was like, where's Waldo in this place?  I really was, though.  Because I looked around, and the people I was with, they had their backs in most of the 
[00:10:30]  crowd, and they had the dark hair.  So most people could assume, well, they might be Asian.  Right.  Me, there's no doubt about it.  Blonde hair just sticking out in a sea of brown heads.  Wow.  How about that, huh?  You felt the little sting of racism, did you?  Definitely.  And I didn't get my little, you know, my hot towel at the end of my dinner.  How's that area down there now?  Chinatown?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Is it cool?  Last time I was there, it had to be like a field trip from school, where you're like,  oh, great, get off the bus, I'll buy the back scratcher and the fan, a little paper 
[00:11:00]  fan and the back scratcher, and then I'm back on the bus.  Yeah.  Any other time.  I know I went again years later, and it was like a scene out of Blade Runner.  I just wanted nothing to do with it.  It's real bright down there.  Yeah.  Yes, definitely.  And you don't feel like you're in New York at all.  No.  You really feel like you're at a faraway land.  Hong Kong.  Yeah.  Great.  So.  Racism for Opie.  How about that?  Joe Pesci's on the hotline.  He is?  Right on.  We'll talk to him next.  We got two from the Rolling Stones as well.  Stay there.  Pennsylvania.  You'll find 30 convenient courtyard locations throughout the area, including Albany Thruway, New York, 
[00:11:30]  Montreal, Canada, Scranton, Pennsylvania, and below.  Looking for their two new hotels in Manhattan and another in Plymouth, Meeting, Pennsylvania.  We're in rare form today.  I suggest you stick around.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Aerosmith playing tonight at the beach.  It's going to be a little cold, maybe a little rainy for the show tonight, but those guys will  definitely rock.  Toys in the Attic and Dream On.  So, Pete Anthony, first of all, I got to acknowledge a new addition to the Facts Wall of Fame over 
[00:12:00]  there behind your head, Anthony.  Yeah, well, we have the little Facts Wall of Fame here in the studio.  We get fun faxes, and we put them off.  Yes.  It's sort of like our refrigerator, and the children send things in, and we hang it up  on the fridge like an A on their test.  Pretty much.  Or the finger paint.  I think what we got to do is put these faxes on our underground website so everyone else  could, you know, enjoy them as much as we do on a daily basis.  Well, now, underneath the pork guy.  Well, explain the pork guy, because I don't know if a lot of people heard about the facts 
[00:12:30]  that were sent in yesterday.  No, it's a pretty good drawing of a stereotypical 19th century Chinese guy.  Like a hiney.  He looks like an emperor.  Yeah.  Doesn't he?  He goes, you stupid.  You forgot to mention shredded pork.  Peking sauce.  But the emperor is on his bike, and he's got the little basket with his pork order, and  that's a great photo.  We like that one a lot.  Then some guy put, Adolf Giuliani says, I hate Opie and Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Sig Heil.  Just kidding.  You guys rule.  Keep it up.  But the picture he got is a great picture of Giuliani.  Yeah.  And then he put the little swastika armband on him.  Yeah.  And the little Hitler mustache.  And, woo, it looks kind of authentic.  You know, and we've got to mention this again, because we have in the past, Adolf Hitler  wrecked that look for everyone.  You can never grow that mustache.  You can just never grow it.  I mean, like the mutton chops come back, and the goatees come back, and even like the 
[00:13:30]  Raleigh Fingers handlebar mustache.  You see that on the streets of New York.  But no one in this fine city of ours has the balls to walk around with the Adolf Hitler  mustache.  No.  Because he wrecked it for everyone.  That's a look that shan't be making a comeback.  Not at all.  All right, um, he's out.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Pesci?  We got Joe Pesci on the line.  Yeah.  The Joe Pesci.  Swear to God.  No one doing a voice.  None of that crap.  It's Joe Pesci.  Yeah, he's got a CD out. 
[00:14:00]  He's got a CD out.  And I'm holding it in my hand, and it looks horrible.  Is this a joke?  I don't know what to make of this.  Uh, Vincent LaGuardia Gambini sings Just For You.  His character from My Cousin Vinny, I guess, right?  How, how, when did that movie come out?  Um, I don't know, like...  That movie's like eight, six years ago, maybe?  Six or eight years old?  Yeah, I think it came out in like 92 or so.  Why would he put out a CD with that character now?  I don't know.  But it's a bunch of tunes, and supposedly he's rapping on one of these songs as well. 
[00:14:30]  Well, don't get him mad.  What do you mean?  You've seen Casino, haven't you?  Yeah, I've seen Casino.  You've seen Casino?  Goodfellas?  Yeah.  That guy's crazy.  He'll shoot you.  I wouldn't get Joe Pesci mad, Anthony.  Hey, Spidey, you stuttering, muttering prick.  Yeah.  I love that movie.  I love that scene, so...  He can't hear us, right?  No.  All right, well, I hope not.  Wait a minute.  Oops.  Well, let's, uh, let's talk to Joe Pesci about his, um, his fine CD.  It's really cool.  I like it.  It's on my hand.  It's got, uh, 14 tracks. 
[00:15:00]  It's got a special Italian mix to one of his songs, and a special Spanish, uh, mix to one  of his songs.  This is great.  I'm going to go home and light the candles and check it out later on tonight.  What?  Be nice to Joe Pesci.  Is this Joe?  Yes, this is Joe.  Joe.  Is it who am I talking to?  Hopi or Anthony?  Both of us.  Actually, yeah.  Well, you guys talk from the same neck?  Pretty much there.  Connected like Siamese twins.  So, uh, Mr. Pesci, I got your CD in front of me. 
[00:15:30]  How do you like it?  It looks great anyway.  It looks good.  I saw the commercials for it this morning.  I'm laying in bed.  I see commercials for this thing.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  What is Joe Pesci doing?  What's this all about?  Well, I just, you know, Tommy Mottola and I from Sony decided, we talked a long time  ago about doing this.  We thought it might be fun to hear a guy from the neighborhood sing all different types of  songs, you know?  So, I did it as Cousin Vinny and did it with a Brooklyn accent so we could have some fun  with it.  And we did little parodies on some songs that people know, you know. 
[00:16:00]  What, did you guys shake down some drug dealers for this cash to put this together?  I don't know.  You and Mottola?  I don't know what to think of this, to be honest with you.  Well, you have to play it and listen to it.  What do you mean you don't know?  All right.  All right.  We could do that.  What song do you suggest we play?  Well, I think your cousin Vinny would be good.  Excuse Opie, Joe.  He's not a, you know, Paisan.  No.  Uh-oh.  He might not understand.  You'd be shoving me in the back of a car, I think.  Well, you can play Wiseguy too, the rap thing, if you like it.  And we'd like to, Joe Pesci rapping? 
[00:16:30]  That's it.  I wrote a thing called Wiseguy.  Can you do a little rap for us on the phone?  No, I couldn't.  You don't know how hard that is.  Those guys are really good.  I didn't know how hard that was.  Yeah, a little white Italian guy.  Can't rap like a black guy.  No, I did it as a white guy.  All right.  With the women that pick up the checks.  All supermodels, you want to need charm.  One chick's a net, the other was blonde.  I heard that father said, I said, mom.  So I whacked them both and left them floating in a pond. 
[00:17:00]  Customated clothes on my head to toe.  Catch the weather.  So do you expect to sell any of these things?  What do you mean do I expect to sell any of them?  What do you think I'm going to do?  Pay for my house with them?  Or sky on my bathroom because of those little plastic squares?  He's going to whack you, Opie.  Listen, you're going to like it.  You'll have some fun with it.  Well, yeah.  Can I use it like for a beer coaster, maybe?  I don't know.  I think you should try to play it first.  Okay.  He's getting mad.  I'm trying to get you mad.  I want to hear the passion that we all know and love. 
[00:17:30]  He's going to curse us.  Do you have your bleeper in your hand?  Yeah, I do.  Go for it.  No, I don't want to do that.  Come on.  I'm the fastest bleeper in the world, actually.  Get the f*** out of here.  I hit it.  I hit it in time.  I hope so.  Come on.  Challenge me.  Go ahead.  No, that's it.  Come on.  I'll give you another plug for the CD.  No, that's it.  You play it.  That'll be enough of a plug.  So what else are you up to, Joe?  That's it.  We're going to this afternoon.  We're doing an in-store at 6 o'clock on 72nd at Broadway. 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  At HMV.  So I'll tell you listeners to get over there, and I'm signing albums.  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  I appreciate it.  What's your next movie, man?  I'm just looking at some stuff yet.  I didn't pick anything.  No?  No, it's relaxing.  Well, we'll see you down at Broadway and 72nd at HMV.  Hey, thanks.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  And there he goes, Joe Pesci.  You were very disrespectful to Joe Pesci.  So he is an actor, right? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Those roles he plays, it's not based on any reality with him?  You better hope so.  Okay.  Tell him you're going to use his CD as a beer coaster.  What?  You want me to fake it?  Did I amuse you?  What is he doing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't believe you were that disrespectful to Joe Pesci.  The sad part is half the listeners are going to think that it wasn't really Joe Pesci.  No, that was really Joe Pesci.  That was absolutely Joe Pesci, man. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  That was fun.  Cool.  You don't tell somebody who's trying to push a CD so you expect to sell any of these things.  You are brutal, man.  What, is him and Mottola drunk?  What, are they out drinking a little too much wine or something?  Hey, if anyone's driving a short bus today, I know where you can take them to get some fine music.  All right.  Sorry.  Two for Tuesday. 
[00:19:30]  Coming back with the Stone Temple Pilots.  Stay right where you are.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with the Talking Heads.  His girlfriend is better from speaking in tongues and life during wartime.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The boss is in the studio.  He's mad at us because he heard some dead air down the hallway.  Well, that's the thing that bosses in this biz radio don't like.  Right.  Is dead air.  Well, we were a little busy.  You hear like, you know, the music's playing.  Yeah.  Right, and then all of a sudden this.  And then the music comes back on. 
[00:20:00]  And that drives a PD nuts.  They sit in their office.  For every second of dead air you hear, it's a minute of dead air that the PD hears.  For the boss.  Yeah.  And the sad part is we wanted to play Darth Vulgar there, but the bit wasn't queued up.  So if you're wondering at home what the hell was going on.  That dead air.  Yeah, it was bad dead air.  Sorry, man.  Sorry, boss.  Sorry, boss.  We'll get right on that.  Yeah, maybe that's why we got a 1-5.  I didn't say nothing.  What?  I don't know what you're saying.  No, we're just having fun here. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Hey, picture of the day comes out of the post.  Look at this one.  James Brown and the Reverend Al.  Did you see this?  Oh, my God.  What are they doing?  The twist?  I don't know what it is, but, you know, Reverend Al.  There's his music.  Reverend Al is a nut and a moron.  Because think about it.  He's always trying to strive for black rights.  He's a leader in the community.  He sure is.  Reverend Al. 
[00:21:00]  Reverend Al.  Help in the community.  That's right.  Raising money.  Hallelujah.  He gets in front of the cameras with James Brown.  What's the first thing he does?  Let me do's a little soft shoe for you.  Look, he's dancing.  I know he is.  What page is that in the post?  Ah, 16.  16.  You've got to open up your workbook at home so you can check out the picture.  You know, he's not talking about issues.  Not talking about, you know, James Brown had some problems with drugs and guns.  Not talking about that.  They get in front of the cameras.  Well, I'll be Mr. Bojangles. 
[00:21:30]  That's right.  Right now.  Dancing with James Brown.  I look like a little troll dancing with the Godfather of Souls.  If their heads get too close together, their hair processing spontaneously combusts.  It can be an interesting feature.  Very nice.  That's the best picture of the day.  I wonder if they're going to have video of that on the news tonight.  Probably.  Because I want to see moving pictures of that.  A little bit of music to it.  Yeah.  That'll be fun.  All right.  We've got lots on the way, so stick around. 
[00:22:00]  I think we could sneak two in from Eric Clapton in just a bit.  And how about the cars, huh?  It's two for Tuesday on N.E.W.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with live lightning crashes and selling the drama.  A couple from the cars before that buy request.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  A lot of people seemed to like our Pesci interview earlier.  Yeah.  Jim from the Bronx.  I've been listening to you from day one.  I used to listen just coming home from work.  Now he listens when he's online, too. 
[00:22:30]  Thank you very much.  Your humor does grow on you every while.  Yeah.  You must not have liked us at the beginning.  Yeah.  All I wanted to say is way to go with Joe Pesci.  Cool.  Who's next, Marlon Brando or James Caan?  Rolling on the floor laughing.  Yeah.  It got a little ugly there.  I just hope the roles he plays in those films is acting.  What are you, what are you, a comedian?  You're funny or something?  I just hope he's not really connected because...  I'll frickin' I'll whack you.  You know, a lot of people are calling up about the Pesci.  I think we've got to replay it. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  It really...  Because that's the weird thing about this show.  People sometimes don't believe that we really have these people on.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  And this was a call from Joe Pesci.  This was actually Joe Pesci.  And we'll replay it before the hour's up, without a doubt, okay?  Good.  He's got a new CD out and we kind of abused him about it.  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  But right now we've got to talk to this lady.  I don't know.  What's her name?  Sandra?  Sandra Margo.  I think she's like a whore or, I don't know, a porn star or something.  I am so sick of these things. 
[00:23:30]  This is the same thing every time you get them on the phone.  It's some ex-whore hose bag.  Trying to sell her story, right?  Her story, her secrets, her videotape, her techniques.  It's always something where it's just an old, aging hose bag.  Yeah.  That can't sell the body anymore, so they sell the memories of what hose they got.  Well, what she's trying to sell, there's a video out.  I've heard of this video.  It's called The Sex Lies of the Stars.  It's America's Most Controversial Video.  It details the sexual preferences of the top celebrities. 
[00:24:00]  Basically, what this lady is going to try to say is that they got actual footage of celebrities having sex.  Real celebrities really having sex.  Yes.  The Sex Lies of the Stars video one includes Jack Nicholson, Rod Stewart, Hugh Grant, Elvis Presley, George Clooney, Jerry Seinfeld, Leonardo DiCaprio, Vanna White, and many others.  Axl Rose is in there as well.  All right.  Larry King.  Larry.  So, she's going to try to peddle this video of these celebrities, supposedly. 
[00:24:30]  Jerry Seinfeld?  Come on.  They got video of Jerry Seinfeld having sex.  I don't know.  What ticks me off is we're going to interview her here, and we don't even have the videotape, so we can't even confirm...  I know.  ...what she's saying is real or not, so...  It's bull.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'll be courteous until she bores me.  All right.  When she starts boring us, let's just let her have it.  The old beat Anthony way.  Sandra.  Sandra.  Yes.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  I've been dying to talk to you. 
[00:25:00]  Why have you been dying to talk to us?  Because I hear you guys are great.  Are you like an ex-Hollywood madam?  No, I'm like an ex-porn star.  I'm not actually like an ex-porn star.  I actually am an ex-porn star.  Porn star.  Yes.  I don't imitate one.  I actually am one.  What was the wildest scene you've done in Porn Up?  We'll give you a pick, okay?  Yeah.  Is it A, letting a guy's f*** on a slice of bread, making a sandwich out of it, and eating  it?  B, banging 15 guys in a boxing ring, then going home and making dinner for the kids without 
[00:25:30]  taking a shower?  Boy, your parents must be proud, you whore.  So you're involved with some video?  Yeah, some video.  I'm actually involved with the video that's taking the country by storm right now and it's  causing a tremendous amount of controversy.  Yeah, it's called The Sex Lies of the Stars.  Yes.  All right, what's this about?  It is actual footage of today's biggest celebrities showing you exactly what it is they do in the  bedroom in their spare time.  Jerry Seinfeld, why he gets the biggest laughs in the bedroom. 
[00:26:00]  Why he has a small penis?  Oh, we're talking concave, honey.  Now, where did you get this video of Jerry Seinfeld doing it?  Here's what I can tell you.  And why isn't he suing you?  Because my lawyers are really specific about how I have to say this because we're treading on  thin legal ground here, so let me put it to you this way.  There are a group of select celebrities here in Los Angeles that have this little underground  club where they set up video cameras in hotel rooms and in their bedrooms and, you know,  where else.  And they invite these starlets and sometimes call girls back to their place to have sex  with them and videotape the girls without them knowing. 
[00:26:30]  And then all of them get together once a week and trade tapes and watch each other's tapes  and say, hey, man, look at you.  Look at you go.  Oh, look at that chick.  Every so often, once the guys get drunk, somebody gets the bright idea to take one of those  tapes and run off with it because maybe, just maybe, it'll be worth something someday to  someone like me who has loads of cash to spend and wants to release it.  So what was Jerry Seinfeld doing in this video?  In the video, you'll see how he's with this girl on the couch and they're watching TV and  he jumps up for no reason.  They're watching like the Spice Channel or something. 
[00:27:00]  He jumps up and starts doing this really stupid chip and bails dance and the guy has  no rhythm whatsoever.  So he starts tripping off his clothes, drops to all fours like a dog, slings over to her  on the couch and she was telling us, she was narrating the whole thing going, you know,  I thought this was going to be hot.  I thought, wow, this guy has no rhythm, but he really seems like he knows what he's doing  and proceeds to humper like a Yorkshire terrier like this.  And within like 10 seconds, he's all over with.  He flops back and he goes, wow, I really needed that.  How was it for you?  And she goes, honestly, to this day, I'm not sure if we had intercourse or outercourse. 
[00:27:30]  What's Leonardo up to in the video?  It's so funny because he's wearing little girl's barrettes and his hair.  He's really weird.  And he has sex with, you know, the girl, Bobby Brown, the video by Warrant Cherry Pie.  Oh, she's hot, yeah.  The hot blonde.  Yeah, she evidently sets up a video camera in her bedroom quite often and she has sex with him.  Oh, really?  Hey, is Vanna White a dyke?  What's that?  Is Vanna White, yeah, she's with another woman, yes.  That's what I hear.  Oh, I've heard she's done some lesbo in the past. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, this videotape is quite, it's old.  It looks like it's about eight or nine years old.  She doesn't look as haggard as she does now.  She looks actually good on this tape.  What star is into the kinkiest sexual escapades?  I think the kinkiest thing on the videotape is Jack Nicholson.  He has this girl in his living room and they're sitting there and you can see it.  And he says to her, have you ever wanted to get an Academy Award?  And she says, well, doesn't every actress?  Of course I wouldn't.  He goes, you know, I'd like to give you an Academy Award.  And she's thinking, what?  So he walks over to his mantle, grabs his Oscar trophy, comes at her, lubes it up, and actually does her with it. 
[00:28:30]  He gives her an Academy Award.  It is hysterical.  He knows that we have this footage and he really, you know what?  He thinks it's great that people are finding out about it.  He really gets off on this.  The other kinky thing is you'll see Axl Rose.  Yeah.  Axl Rose likes the backdoor boogie, getting it from a girl.  Come on.  Wait, with a strap on?  Fingers.  He really, and it's all there.  And he also puts a ball gag on this girl and he like slaps her around and ties her down.  And then after he has his way with her, she does him in the backdoor. 
[00:29:00]  And he's like so into it.  And this is all on this videotape, huh?  All on the video.  Larry King.  Oh.  What does that mess up to?  I have to tell you about that one because I was the one that was with him.  Okay, gag.  Okay, everybody.  Make fun of me.  Wait, you did Larry King?  Yes, I did.  You are a lot.  Speak into the microphone.  But he really is an awesome oral lover.  He had a great technique.  You're in the air.  I'm telling you, you guys, to this day.  We're going to be talking next week with Hillary Clinton. 
[00:29:30]  Rochester, you're on the air.  Hey, do you take it up the butt?  Me?  Yeah.  Something.  I was just bored with your story.  Probably not you.  If you'll do Larry King, trust me, I think you'll do me.  Well, we didn't have intercourse.  He went down on me and he just kind of pushed me down on the ground and just kind of went for it.  And I was so stunned, I really didn't even have time to say yes or no.  I was shocked.  That's a cute little story.  Did his hairpiece get stuck where the sun don't shine?  No, but he did take his glasses off, though.  And he does take his suspenders off, too. 
[00:30:00]  Who else have you nailed?  Mitch Pelleggi from The X-Files.  He plays Lieutenant Skinner.  And also Pauly Shore.  I know I really have a way to do that.  Oh, my God.  What a sexual resume you have.  Yeah, I know.  It's really loud.  Pauly Shore.  I'm a loser.  But the video is available for a very, very, very limited time.  So what is the wildest thing you've used during sex?  Ron Jeremy.  I don't know.  Oh, you had sex with Ron Jeremy, too?  No, I wasn't sex with him.  That's fat slob.  Yeah, did he rest his belly up on your butt?  I'll tell you one thing.  He can't find his feet.  Hey, tell me, do my shoes match? 
[00:30:30]  He's a character.  You know, what is it about these ugly Jewish guys like Larry King and Ron Jeremy?  Is it because they have no weenie to speak of, so they've got to compensate for it in  the oral department?  Because Larry King really is.  I mean, he gave me some great head.  He did, huh?  Yeah.  To this day, I call his technique the Larry Lip technique, because he's the only person  that's ever done it to me.  He was probably having a seizure.  Well, it worked.  There are a total of 17 celebrities on this tape.  Hey, have you ever done it with a dog? 
[00:31:00]  What, male or female?  Oh, no.  Just kidding.  Hey, how many VHS tapes would fit in your butt sideways?  Air out of the box.  You guys are cute.  Oh, we tried.  All right, continue.  What do you want to know?  Have you ever had a guy clap inside you?  No, and I've never had to clap.  Well, what's longer, the distance John Glenn traveled around the earth, or the miles of  penis you've had in you? 
[00:31:30]  It's a tough one.  Can't you guys come up with some original questions?  Come on.  That's a good one.  Who would the last one ask you that?  It is?  In whose opinion?  Listen, man, you did Larry King.  Yeah.  I don't know if you would want to attempt to have a heckle fight with us.  He was lousy.  A welcome figure.  Oh, he's just so meat.  He's such a meat and potatoes kind of guy when it comes to sex.  Just in, in, in, in, out, in, out.  That's it.  Hey, would you let me and Anthony throw you on the rotisserie and play cards in your back?  What are you eating? 
[00:32:00]  A hot dog.  I'm so hungry.  I haven't eaten today.  I'm starving.  That hot dog wasn't up Axel's butt, was it?  Up Axel's butt.  Hey, could you go more than five minutes without putting something long and hard in your mouth?  Yeah, I can put something thick and short in my mouth.  Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld.  Do you have a dictionary in your house?  A dictionary?  Look under P for pride.  Hey, well, you're the one that has me on your show.  Check that definition out.  It was a lovely interview.  Larry King. 
[00:32:30]  All right, so where do we go from here?  We tell your listeners how to get the video before it's banned.  Okay.  The video is called Sex Lives of the Stars, Volumes 1 and 2, and you can get it by calling toll-free 888-975-STAR.  That's S-T-A-R, not the star button.  I know.  I feel like I shouldn't have to say that, but I do.  888-975-STAR.  And you can also, we have a website where you can actually view some of the footage from the video before you buy it.  And that's worldwideweb.sexlivesofthestars.com. 
[00:33:00]  All right, great.  Did you have fun?  Oh, I had a blast.  Was it educational?  I learned that you'll screw anything.  Just about.  All right, Sandra, thanks.  Anything but you.  Okay, love you guys.  All right.  It wouldn't worry about Larry King.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Led Zeppelin.  Four sticks.  And over the hills and far away.  A lot of people requesting Zeppelin as they head to the stadium for the big game tonight. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Kone, Kone, Kone.  And I just want to call upon the Yankee fans.  Now, we know that, you know, Cleveland fans have been a little abrasive to our team.  But I want to, I just want to say to the Yankee fans, please, please, give it back to them 20-fold.  You see, Giuliani, we have to have class.  Just because they don't want, they don't have class, we can show them that New Yorkers are a classy bunch of people that suffer and suck his ass. 
[00:34:00]  We don't have to make a scene like they did.  He makes the biggest scene.  You see all the stormtroopers now that are at the stadium for the games?  I know.  Give us a break.  We're not that nasty.  Bizarre.  It's like the Death Star.  It is.  I want to see it like the late 70s when we won the pennants and stuff.  Why not, Earl?  Where the fans like take to the field and rip it up? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, rip it up.  That used to be so exciting to watch from home.  When they finally win it and the stands empty out and the horses are going nuts and stampeding people.  Stampeding people.  It was awesome.  People getting battered.  That's great.  It was just exciting to watch at home.  Now they just line up the stormtroopers and you just got to sit in your seat and just clap.  Well, you got to also, the people have gotten a little out of hand since then, too.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, they run up and pop a player in the head. 
[00:35:00]  You know, they don't care.  You hit the Indians dugout and just start beating the crap out of the players.  That's true.  You know, I got to tell you something.  I worked in radio in Buffalo when the Bills were having all those great years.  I'm sorry.  Trust me.  It was a prison sentence.  I did my three years and I got out of there.  But I was up there for, you know, all that exciting football that they gave everybody.  Four Super Bowl losses.  The city almost killed themselves.  Well, at least they got cute girls up there.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  We called them Buffalo Bettys, but that's another story for another time.  Yeah.  But anyway, when they finally won, you know, the conference and they were going to the Super Bowl,  the stands emptied out and they ripped the goalpost out from the base.  So now it's a huge goalpost.  And now the fans are like, all right, how are we going to get this out of the stadium?  They passed it up all the way above the bleachers and dumped it over the side as a force.  What is that, like a 200-foot drop?  Yes, but it was like a bunch of ants because they wanted to get the goalpost out of the stadium. 
[00:36:00]  So they all figured out that they could just drag it to the top of the stadium and throw it over the side.  And then we're driving home about a half hour, 40 minutes later, and there's the goalpost with about 200 fans still holding on to it.  Basically, the last person to hold on to is going to, you know, get to bring it wherever they want.  Yeah, where?  And we're driving down the road, and there's the goalpost walking down the road.  It was classic.  But nowadays, you can't see that stuff, you know? 
[00:36:30]  No, no, they take charge now.  Yeah, big time.  Stick around.  We're going to replay our Joe Pesci interview before we get out of here.  Oh, we've still got an hour, actually, and then we've got to check out the Yankee game.  It was a good interview, so we'll replay that for you.  And let's go to the phones here and see if anyone has anything today.  I haven't done many phones today.  Hi, N.E.W.  I was listening to the end of Scott Muni's show today, The Professor.  Yeah.  And he was signing off, and he had Hank Fired by the Stones queued up.  And he says, okay, well, we'll see you tomorrow. 
[00:37:00]  Until then, I'll...  And there's a pause, and you can actually hear the wheels turning.  He's trying to think of something clever to say.  And he says, until then, I'll do a doo-doo and hang fire.  Because he had Thai food for lunch or something.  Do...  What?  Do a doo-doo.  Do a doo-doo?  Do a doo-doo and hang fire.  Do a doo-doo and hang fire?  I don't know.  I almost drove off the road.  I was in my car.  Scott's making dumping jokes.  Wait, Earl's in the studio.  Earl, grab this mic.  Can you confirm that?  Earl's in the studio during the entire 15-minute show that Scott does. 
[00:37:30]  No, stop it.  Don't be.  And after the ratings that came out today, I think Scott's show is going to be down to seven minutes.  He's going to play three Beatles songs in seven minutes, and he's going to be out.  Now, what happened, Earl?  Did he say that?  Well, we were talking off mic, and we were having a little fun with the line hang fire.  And, well, I can't repeat the line on the air.  Why?  What is it?  It's kind of vulgar.  Hang fire.  What line?  What could that be?  Just say it, Earl. 
[00:38:00]  I got the bleep button.  Well, it has bleep fire and save matches was the line.  But we never...  He was going to say it.  That's where the pause came from.  He was going to say it, and I'm looking at him like, don't you even think about saying it.  What's the line?  What's the line?  I'm not going to say it.  Bleep fire?  What?  Bleep fire.  Just say it, Earl.  I'm not going to say it.  Scott Muni's not saying it.  You're saying it.  Say it!  I'm not going to say it.  I'll give you...  It rhymes with hit. 
[00:38:30]  It rhymes with head?  With hit?  Hit.  Oh, hit.  Oh.  Oh.  Shit fire.  And save matches.  What, you don't curse?  No, not really.  Oh.  Jesus.  What the hell is going on here?  A black guy that doesn't curse?  Come on.  I'm a good boy.  What can I say?  Who you calling boy?  All right.  Well, Scott, so is this true?  Were you going to do that today?  Yes.  I was going to say, shit fire.  And what's the other line, Earl? 
[00:39:00]  Save matches.  F*** matches.  Shit fire.  F*** matches.  And screw all your asses.  You ruined my station, you c*** suckers.  I just turned into dirty Scott's up.  I like that, though.  Go ahead.  Continue.  Suck me raw.  I wanted to play a different song.  Earl got in my way, and I, f*** all of you.  You c*** sucking s*** heads. 
[00:39:30]  Are you done, Scott?  Go f*** yourself, Opie.  All right.  He's done.  You and that asshole Anthony.  All right.  Thanks, Scott.  That was great.  What the hell is that?  All right.  Two from R.E.M. next.  Stay there.  Baby.  R.E.M. on Two for Tuesday.  On the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I got a fax in my hand, Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  I see.  Actually, it's a fax that's supposed to make it to the boss's office.  To the station manager of WNEW.  Oops.  How did you get it?  Oh, I have my ways.  All right.  Should I read it?  It's from Ted Fairfield.  All right, Teddy.  What are you saying?  Well, Ted wants to tell the station manager,  I must assume that you had heard Opie and Anthony before you brought them to your station.  Therefore, this is not a mistake on your part,  but an indication of the future direction of WNEW. 
[00:40:30]  Although I cannot find a good replacement for the old WNEW,  I will keep looking.  Thank you for 30 wonderful years of radio.  It's a shame it must end like this.  Goodbye.  Oh, Ted Fairfield.  Bye, bye, Ted.  Now, Anthony, what should I do with the fax?  I mean, it's for the boss.  Well, I would probably put it in his mailbox.  You think?  I would go down the end of the hall.  Okay.  Where the mailboxes are.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Fold it nice, maybe a little crease.  Okay.  And slide it gently into his mailbox.  Because he'd be interested in reading about this, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  He's interested in all feedback that we get here.  And Ted's phone numbers are on the top of the page,  so maybe he would even call Ted and try to explain what's going on here at NEW, right?  And give Ted a chance to maybe further elaborate on how he feels about the Opie and Anthony show  and the direction of WNEW.  Okay, so I should put it right over here, right?  Yeah.  Place it over here.  Save it there.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, that's it.  Filed.  Hi, NEW, what do you got?  How you guys doing?  All right.  Dude, I just want to let you know, cruising up the West Side Highway here, on our way over to the Deegan.  We're on our way to the big Yankee Stadium.  All right.  To catch this unbelievable David Kahn performance that we're all anticipating.  It's going to be awesome.  Do you have anything in store for the Indian fans?  We sent the secretary out today to buy those toy water guns. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And we're going to try and get him through security.  We want to throw him at justice, you know?  I don't know if we're going to get the chance to do it or not, but we're definitely trying.  We got four of them here.  We got four of them here in the briefcases.  So, hopefully, you know, if you hear about us getting arrested, you know it's Chris and the boys from the Bronx.  That's the ones who are up to it.  If I'm watching the game tonight, I see the plastic guns make the field.  I will die laughing at home.  It serves just as right making that Uzi comment.  What a son of a gun. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, your phone.  Oh, your phone.  You know, we could send a man to Mars almost.  I know, I know.  I'm sorry, guys.  But we can't make a cell phone that works on the West Side Highway to call Midtown.  What is up with that?  What are our priorities at this point?  I don't know, guys.  I'm sorry about that.  Right now, you can see what the Hubble Telescope is viewing.  I know, right?  In outer space from your laptop computer.  12 billion miles away or whatever the hell it is.  John Glenn, 70 years old, they're going to ship his old colostomy-bagged ass up into space. 
[00:43:00]  Do you and Julie think he's going to come back alive?  Because I don't.  I think they're going to leave him up there.  You see his picture in Newsday?  He looks like the turtle from the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I'm going to beat the rabbit.  All right, we've had enough fun with you, man.  Have a great time at the stadium.  Keep it up, fellas.  All right.  You see him? 
[00:43:30]  I see him.  Hey, Doc.  You're taking a spaceship?  They're putting me in a spaceship.  I'm going to beat the red.  Look.  His neck.  I know.  It fits in the suit.  Wait until that gravity goes away up there.  You know how, like, when the girls go into space, their hair flies all up?  Yeah.  His just going to be this big lump of skin floating around in space.  Because the gravity's got that neck is going to be up around his... 
[00:44:00]  I'm talking from space, honey.  Ah!  John!  What's that around your neck?  It's my nipples, honey.  This isn't the same as when I first came up in the 60s.  My penis is where my chest usually is.  And my testicles just hit me in the eye.  Well, he's not the man he used to be.  A little looser.  Come on.  He's an American hero, Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  You know how your private area gets with age?  Oh.  You've talked about how you almost sit on him after a while.  And I can only imagine once gravity isn't around anymore.  We could talk about the saggy sack some other time.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, maybe later on in the show.  Okay, great.  Hey, coming back with two from you, too.  And if you missed our Joe Pesci interview from earlier, please stick around.  It's a classic.  It's really Pesci, too.  It's not like a put-on.  Yeah, and we'll do that right after U2. 
[00:45:00]  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  The Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW from Pop.  That's U2 staring at the sun.  Sunday Bloody Sunday before that.  The new U2 CD's coming out November 3rd.  The Greatest Hits Package.  1980 through 1990.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I see you holding Joe Pesci's CD cover there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Vincent LaGuardia Gambini.  Of course, the character he played in My Cousin Vinny. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  He put a CD together.  Yes.  As that character.  Yes.  With Tommy Mottola bankroll in this thing.  Yes, from Columbia, right?  What was this, a bet someone lost?  I don't know.  Mottola doesn't have enough money to give away to Mariah Carey?  He's kind of stuck giving something to Joe Pesci.  Right.  I'm just laughing because obviously the record company sent this over and we appreciate that.  Thank you, guys.  And they put stars next to all the tracks they think are really good, I guess. 
[00:46:00]  Like the hits?  Yeah, the hits.  Take Your Love and Shove It.  Joe Pesci doing Take Your Love and Shove It.  Joe Pesci doing I've Got News for You.  And Joe Pesci singing If It Doesn't Snow for Christmas.  Oh, my God.  You know, you watch the great movies, Goodfellas, Casino.  Yeah.  He's brilliant.  Right.  You know what, though?  Why do you have to do this?  I don't know.  I really don't get it. 
[00:46:30]  Honestly, though, my table at home is a little wobbly.  So I'm going to bring this home and take care of that wobbly leg.  Take the matchbooks out of there.  Yeah, but the CD, it'll go to good use.  Here's an email.  First, eight heads in a duffel bag.  Then gone fishing.  Now a Rhapsody.  Boy, oh, boy, is his career rising.  I'm telling you, he's going to be big.  What the F was he thinking?  Did he do this on a freaking bet?  Tommy Mottola must have been on Prozac after he and Mariah split up. 
[00:47:00]  Don't forget to check the label.  He might be on Restaurant Records just like you two.  Oh, that hurt.  Cut it out.  And please don't use my name just in case you read this on the air.  I don't want Fat Tony to whack me.  You know what the sad part is about this whole thing?  Joe Pesci, you know, singing as the My Cousin Vinny character?  He will sell more CDs than our Domain World.  Oh, of course he will.  A project that we took years to put out and we're very proud of.  But no record store in Manhattan carries it for some reason. 
[00:47:30]  But the Joe Pesci CD, front and center with a big poster.  I'm sure.  Come on in, kids, and get your Joe Pesci CD.  Big picture of Joe Pesci there.  You could take a picture with his picture, probably.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony's Domain World, good luck.  Try finding it in Manhattan.  You won't.  Oh, well.  Anyway, early in the show, we had the pleasure of talking to his greatness, Joe Pesci.  This is actually Joe Pesci.  We've got to tell people that.  I know, it really is.  It really is, because half the time you guys don't know what's real and what's fake. 
[00:48:00]  So, this is Pesci.  Is this Joe?  Yes, this is Joe.  Joe.  Who am I talking to, Opie or Anthony?  Both of us.  Well, you guys talk from the same neck?  Pretty much there.  Connected like Siamese twins.  So, Mr. Pesci, I got your CD in front of me.  How do you like it?  It looks great, anyway.  It looks good.  I saw the commercials for it this morning.  I'm laying in bed.  I see commercials for this thing.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  What is Joe Pesci doing?  What's this all about? 
[00:48:30]  Well, I just, you know, Tommy Mottola and I from Sony decided, we talked a long time  ago about doing this.  We thought it might be fun to hear a guy from the neighborhood sing all different type of  songs, you know?  So, I did it as Cousin Vinny and did it with a Brooklyn accent so we could have some fun  with it.  And we did little parodies on some songs that people know, you know.  What, did you guys shake down some drug dealers for this cast and put this together?  I don't know.  You and Mottola?  I don't know what to think of this, to be honest with you.  Well, you have to play it and listen to it.  What do you mean you don't know? 
[00:49:00]  All right.  All right.  We could do that.  What song do you suggest we play?  Well, I think your cousin Vinny would be good.  Excuse Opie, Joe.  He's not a, you know, paisan.  No.  Uh-oh.  He might not understand.  You'd be shoving me in the back of a car, I think.  Well, you can play Wise Guy, too, the rap thing, if you like it.  And we'd like to, Joe Pesci rapping?  That's it.  I wrote a thing called Wise Guy.  Can you do a little rap for us on the phone?  No, I couldn't.  You don't know how hard that is.  Those guys are really good.  I didn't know how hard that was.  Yeah, a little white Italian guy can't rap like a black guy. 
[00:49:30]  No, I did it as a white guy.  All right, wait.  I've got to hear Joe Pesci rapping.  This is Wise Guy off Joe Pesci's new CD.  Check it out.  It's a bitch's head of the guitar.  It's a bitch's head of the guitar.  It's a bitch's head of the guitar.  Hey, hey, paid with the stash.  Treat all the bronze like trash. 
[00:50:00]  You'll catch a blast if you move too fast.  I talk to class and you don't have to ask.  Getting everything by flash and cash.  Fighting and stealing, don't kill without stealing.  So I went in casinos before they started dealing.  All about respect and intellect.  Only mess with the women that pick up the check.  Supermodels, one on each arm.  One chick's brunette, the other was blonde.  I heard their fathers had stocks and bonds.  So I whacked them both and left them floating in a pond.  Customate clothes from head to toe.  Catch Joe at the fight scene.  So do you expect to sell any of these things? 
[00:50:30]  What do you mean do I expect to sell any?  What do you think I'm going to do?  Paper my house with them?  A guy in my bathroom because of the little plastic squares?  He's going to whack you, Opie.  Listen, you're going to like it.  You'll have some fun with it.  Well, yeah.  Can I use it like for a beer coaster maybe?  I don't know.  I think you should try to play it first.  Okay.  He's getting mad.  I'm trying to get you mad.  I want to hear the passion that we all know and love.  He's going to curse.  Do you have your bleeper in your hand?  Yeah, I do.  Go for it. 
[00:51:00]  No, I don't want to do that.  Come on.  I'm the fastest bleeper in the world, actually.  Get the f*** out of here.  There you have one.  I hit it.  I hit it in time.  I hope so.  Come on, challenge me.  Go ahead.  No, that's it.  Come on.  I'll give you another plug for the CD.  No, that's it.  You play it.  That'll be enough of a plug.  So what else are you up to, Joe?  That's it.  We're going to this afternoon.  We're doing an in-store at 6 o'clock on 72nd and Broadway.  Okay.  At HMV.  So I'll tell you listeners to get over there, and I'm signing albums. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  I appreciate it.  What's your next movie, man?  I'm just looking at some stuff yet.  I didn't pick anything.  No?  No, just relaxing.  Well, we'll see you down at Broadway and 72nd at HMV.  Hey, thanks.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  And there he goes, Joe Pesci from earlier today.  He's going to whack you.  He's at the HMV record store right now, if you want to say hi to him.  Yeah.  And tell him Opie and Anthony sent you.  I was just looking at the CD a little more.  Yeah.  And if you buy the CD, Anthony, there's two bonus tracks. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  The Yo Cousin Vinny song, done in Italian, and the Yo Cousin Vinny Spanish song.  Wow.  That's got to be worth the price right there.  All right.  We've got to move on.  It's two for Tuesday.  What do you want to hear next, Ant?  Rush or the Eagles?  Rush.  We'll do Rush.  1027 WNNW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday.  Rush from Farewell to Kings, Closer to the Heart, Tom Sawyer from Moving Pictures.  That was a must-have when I was going to high school. 
[00:52:30]  Of course.  In Harborfields, everyone had to have their copy of Moving Pictures.  What?  Nothing.  What?  Just, you know, memories growing up at the same time.  I remember that.  You had to have that.  You had to have that, right?  Yeah.  You had to have Van Halen's first album.  Of course.  What else did you have to have?  Those were must-hams.  Leonard Skinner album, Never Hurt.  Molly Hatchett.  Molly Hatchett?  Come on, man.  That first album there, Flirting with Disaster.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  With the big guy with the big battle axe.  Yeah.  Paint that mural on the side of your 40 condo line van with the bubble window.  Open up that door.  Yeah, there's my shag carpeting.  I'm building a bed.  Yeah, but the rest of the album I just didn't like.  I didn't either.  I bought the Molly Hatchett myth.  I bought the CD because of that song.  And I personally didn't like the rest of it, so.  Errol, what do you got?  Errol has some breaking news, I think. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  David Stern has announced that the first two weeks of the NBA season have been canceled.  Oh, great.  Crime's going up.  Oh, we're on the radio?  Well, just because the players are out of work, crime's going to go up.  Not because of the people watching at home.  Can you imagine the NBA players running the streets and not working?  That's a scary thought.  Lucky daughters. 
[00:54:00]  What, man?  Crime's going up.  Huh?  Crime's going up.  Crime's going up.  No NBA season.  What?  I thought we were all just having fun here.  What?  Why?  What happened?  I don't even know what you mean by that, Opie.  No.  All right, well.  I guarantee it is, though.  Not one bookstore will be wrong.  Oh, my God.  I got that off of page six, by the way.  I can't even sit in this room with you people. 
[00:54:30]  Why?  Earl Black, he's laughing.  What's that got to do with it?  Yeah, what do you mean by that?  I'm getting the hell out of here.  No one even said anything about black, white, Asian, or anything.  Well, there's not many white guys in the NBA.  Coaches.  Coaches.  Great.  Coaches.  My goodness.  What happened to the white athlete, anyway?  It's gone.  It's gone.  The words of Jimmy the Greek, Opie.  Remember that guy? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, Jimmy the Greek.  In one statement, his career was done.  That guy holding the camera must have just seen big, fat Jimmy the Greek with that drink.  Hey, Jimmy.  What are your thoughts on whites and blacks in sports?  Well, let me tell you something, son.  The guy's just rolling going, I got gold here.  This is the end of Jimmy the Greek.  You see, your slave owner took your big black buck, and he'd breed him with the black female, 
[00:55:30]  and that's why, you know, their leg muscles.  The guy's just, keep talking, Jimmy.  Keep talking, Jimmy.  You see the extra bone in the leg.  Oh, really, Jimmy?  Elaborate, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Goodbye.  He thought he was untouchable at that point, too.  That's the funny part about that.  Marv wears a dress.  He comes back to TV.  Yep.  Fights women.  He comes back.  There was no coming back from that one.  All right.  So the NBA season, we're losing the first month, Earl? 
[00:56:00]  Seriously?  I don't think it's going to happen at all.  Wow.  Oh.  I hope he's going to go through withdrawals, man.  Oh, that's my favorite sport.  I'm serious.  He comes back to watch and play and everything.  Bring the ladies back.  Oh, yeah, that usually happens.  What are they going to do?  They're going to probably put the ladies on the court or something.  It's going to be like a league of their own when the men went off to war to play baseball.  They're going to have Rosie O'Donnell out there on the basketball court.  It's the all-girls league. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Well, if they have an all-girls league, can they at least play in skirts and not wear underwear?  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  What?  I thought we're...  You want to see that?  What?  I thought we were just joking around here.  Girls aren't exactly tired of banks that are playing.  That would be cool.  That would rock.  Work that out.  Let's have a supermodel basketball league where they wear skirts and no underwear.  They wear those things they wear on the fashion show on E!  You want to talk about ratings?  The sheer stuff.  I want to talk about ratings.  That would be huge.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  So would I.  All right.  Stay there.  The mess continues.  We've got two from The Fix next.  Flax, what are you smiling about?  Oh, it's a mess in the studio today.  It's Opie and Anthony for just a few more minutes here.  On the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, The Fix.  Red Skies and One Thing Leads to Another.  On the Rock of New York on Two for Tuesday. 
[00:57:30]  Matt Devotee is going to keep the twofers rolling for you this afternoon.  No, this evening.  Yes.  Yes.  Matt, are you going to be watching the game as your DJ?  No, of course not.  No.  No.  I will check the wire, though, periodically.  Periodically?  Periodically.  Okay.  Just wondering.  Matt being one of the hugest Yankee fans.  Why don't you take tonight off?  Because Lisa took it off, so somebody had to come in.  Oh.  She went to that Elvis Costello thing at Carnegie Hall.  Oh, I heard that's going to be good, so. 
[00:58:00]  Him and Bert.  You're talking about strange elaborations.  But in a way, it's got to be pretty cool.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Great.  Can't wait to.  Oh, I'm going to the gay Jesus play, I think.  Looks like a pisser down there on the street.  Yeah, we're going to be able to get out of the building.  There's a huge demonstration going on outside our building.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a, like, Corpus Christi.  Yeah.  Where they, it's a gay Jesus?  Is that what the story is?  And the apostles, and he's, what, tongue kissing?  Yeah, yeah.  The apostles? 
[00:58:30]  And they've toned it down.  Oh, my God, really?  They made it more mainstream.  I was reading all about it in yesterday's paper, and I'm just laughing.  They toned it down.  Oh, gee.  They toned it down.  That's nice.  Wow.  Okay, great.  How could they have toned down from that?  Yeah, you've got to, I'd be scared to go down there.  Why don't they just have them smoking and having a gun, too?  You know, like, every group can get involved, you know?  You've got the tobacco industry, the firearms, and whoever else.  I can't believe.  Drinking with underage kids.  We never.  The protest would go here to the Hudson. 
[00:59:00]  All right, great.  All right, yeah, well, I'm going down there, I guess.  Yeah.  And we're not going to be able to get out of here.  You know that.  I'm making a beeline.  Well, I have a dilemma.  What?  Well, we've got the Yankee game on tonight.  Mm-hmm.  And the Guinness Book of World Records is rerunning the 300-pound tumor thing tonight.  Oh.  Well, that's what VCRs are for.  You tape the tumor.  You watch the game.  I haven't figured out how to do that.  I still haven't figured out how to watch one thing and tape something else. 
[00:59:30]  You are a mess.  Somebody, we wanted you to tape something.  Yeah.  Or you wanted us to tape something.  We said, why can't you do it?  Well, because I need my TV on when I tape it.  And I don't want to leave the house with the TV on.  Right.  You don't need your TV on when you tape something.  Let me tell you something.  Any way your VCR is hooked up, you don't need the TV on.  I went away for a week and left my TV on for a week so I could tape ER because I couldn't  figure out how to do it any other way.  You do exactly what you did, except you turn the TV off. 
[01:00:00]  You don't need the TV on.  The TV is after the VCR and everything.  The end of the line is your television set.  I try that.  There's no video out that you would put into your VCR.  Then I have it hooked up wrong because it doesn't work.  I have got to see this.  I've got to see what you have going on over there.  Oh, it's a mess.  I still haven't hooked up my printer either.  You've had this printer for two years now.  It's probably not even new.  Honestly, I got a printer for my Mac and Slosh. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  And I've had it for over a year and I still haven't hooked it up.  So like when I get some cool stuff off the internet that I want to bring in for the show,  I sit there and I...  He writes it out.  I've seen him do this.  I write it out longhand.  He has the computer, the printer and everything.  And it's like, oh, this would be good for the show.  And he pulls out a piece of paper and starts writing.  Yeah.  You have a printer.  Oh, yeah.  I don't have it hooked up.  No.  Oh, wow.  That is tough.  Plugging in cords.  It's just plug it in. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  From the guy that leaves his TV on a week so he can tape VR.  I'll figure it out.  Do you know the video signal goes into your TV and that's it?  And it also goes into your VCR.  You don't need the TV on.  What are you watching?  Fanatic.  Who is it?  I don't know.  I'm hoping it's a cool one.  Hmm.  Nah.  I haven't seen any good ones.  Yeah, we saw the best one.  Oh, the Hanson one was good.  The Hanson one where this kid, he's a senior in high school and he can meet anyone in the 
[01:01:30]  world and he wants to meet Hanson.  I want to meet Hanson.  It's a guy.  It was.  All the chicks that probably signed up for Fanatic to meet Hanson and they picked the  one guy.  They picked the senior guy.  Well, he's, I truly believe they're singing about me.  Went like Umbop.  I thought that was about me.  And they bring him in and he's all, oh, look, there they are.  More excited than if Michael Jackson met him.  Yeah.  He goes running to him.  Oh, I love your music. 
[01:02:00]  Wow.  And even Frank and Hanson, who's.  Yeah, the older one.  Who doesn't get many.  Who doesn't get many women.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Even he was horrified.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Lily.  Oh, Mbop, Lily.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Yeah, there's the middle one and the younger one.  Yeah.  You know, and they look like chicks.  Yeah.  And then there's Frank and Hanson.  Oh, Mbop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Grandpa.  Oh, Mbop, Grandpa.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Here's Spot. 
[01:02:30]  Spot, Spot, Mbop.  Even he was horrified, though, so.  Frank and Hanson.  What?  What?  I thought we were just having fun here.  What happened?  What?  Let's get out of here.  What's going on? </pre>
