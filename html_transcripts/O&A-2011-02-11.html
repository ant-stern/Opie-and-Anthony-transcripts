<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Egyptian protests against Hosni Mubarak, marked by crude humor and offensive jokes about the situation, the protestors, and news coverage.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, speculated on Mubarak's actions and the protestors' motivations, interjecting frequent vulgar commentary.  A running gag involved a fictional "bread helmet" worn by a rock-throwing protestor, leading to further sexually suggestive jokes.  They also discussed the video game Tropico, drawing parallels to the Egyptian political situation.  Other tangents included the at symbol (@), movie screenings (and a negative review of "Just Go With It"), and a call-in from Road Dog offering his perspective on Egypt. The segment concluded with jokes about a Maxim magazine cover featuring Michelle Trachtenberg and a mention of an earlier "Catfish" episode discussion.

The show then shifted to a graphic discussion comparing the supposed smell and taste of female genitalia to various foods and Michelle Trachtenberg, followed by a detailed description of a picture depicting a large growth on a woman's genitalia.  This was followed by an "Oscar Moments" segment featuring a humorous clip from *The Social Network*.  Anthony then recounted his experience at a Richie Rich fashion show in New York, using highly offensive language to describe the attendees and their behavior, including numerous gay men, drag queens, and transgender individuals.  This led to a discussion about homosexuality and several callers sharing anecdotes about their own experiences with sexuality and masculinity, often involving homoerotic situations, drug use, and same-sex encounters. The segment ended with a discussion of a Justin Bieber movie and a rape awareness commercial, which they promised to play after the break, along with a mention of Buck Cherry as a guest the following week.

The final segment focused heavily on Justin Bieber's movie "Never Say Never," Lady Gaga, and the newly created comedic persona of "Billy the Bassman."  The hosts criticized Bieber's success and lack of independence, descending into crude jokes about his young fans.  They brainstormed pranks targeting Bieber movie audiences, often involving young girls.  The conversation then turned to Lady Gaga, with graphic and sexual descriptions of her appearance.  A comparison was made between Anderson Cooper's experience reporting from Egypt and that of previous generations of journalists.  A significant portion was dedicated to Larry the Cable Guy, analyzing his persona and comparing it to his off-air demeanor.  This led to the extensive development of "Billy the Bassman," a redneck comedic persona created by Bobby Kelly, featuring the catchphrase "Where are we going?"  The hosts promoted their "Car Crash Comedy" segment and introduced a Twitter hashtag game, #wherearewgoing, based on the Billy the Bassman bit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m. An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  When you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  You know, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Morning, everyone.  Morning.  Doodly-dee-dee-doo.  Scoop-a-dee-dee-da.  Hi, everyone.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Feeling pretty good about that. 
[00:01:30]  But, you know, there is just a dark cloud over this Friday.  Why?  What's the dark cloud?  I got to just shoulder the burden of this Egypt thing.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  I forgot about it.  Well, you know, I know the people are frustrated in Tahrir Square.  Tahrir.  I think it's Tahrir.  Yeah.  I'm frustrated watching this because I want the big, you know, the big ending.  The big payoff.  There's no payoff to this stupid TV show. 
[00:02:00]  It's like everything else.  It's like The Sopranos, like Lost.  Yes.  I want this show to have a good ending.  It's just dragging on and on.  I think they went a little too long with the episodes.  They went too long.  Yeah.  They went one season too long.  One season.  Like, will you fucking drag this guy out of the palace?  Hang him up by his heels.  What are you waiting for?  And to cheer.  And then go about your business.  Stop being confused.  He's not leaving.  Go to the palace and get him.  Yeah.  Do something.  Did they finish their prayers? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  They're in the middle of prayers.  Now they're waving.  When we got into work.  And now they're cheering.  Just go get him.  Well, the story, wow, right back in the news, though, huh?  Yeah, I heard the military on my way in today.  They're sort of protecting the palace, but they're hinting that they might have left a couple holes open.  Really?  So they could get a little closer.  Because the military, they're saying that they're backing Mubarak, but they're certainly not really showing it.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  They're doing, like, the bare minimum.  Well, this is, yeah, quite a stalemate.  So I'm wondering if within the military there's some division.  Probably.  I'm wondering if there's a lot of arguing going on in the military.  Well, Mubarak came on last night, pretty late last night.  He fucked over the world.  Yeah, yeah.  You saw before he talked, obviously, where Obama's joking and smiling, like, oh, we're about to witness history in the making.  And, yeah.  And they're interviewing everybody in the square, and they're like, this is a great day for Egypt. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, they're all happy.  He's leaving.  Right.  This is going to be great.  Rachel Maddow put on her best man suit, and she got all gussied up.  Oh, boy.  Anderson Cooper.  He turned over his barstool so three friends could sit and watch with him.  Right.  That old gag.  Wolf Blitzer almost said, we don't have a situation here because this is being taken care of.  I heard he brought in 15 new screens behind him to really just show every angle. 
[00:04:00]  And then all of a sudden, he starts talking, and then halfway through, you're like, oh, my God, this guy's not leaving.  I was like, yeah.  Holy shit.  He comes on.  He starts talking.  Everybody's like, here it comes, the historic resignation, the step-down speech.  And then as you're watching, you're going, you know, I'm not sure if this translator's getting everything right.  Or maybe I'm not understanding, it's getting lost in the translation or something, but I don't think he's leaving.  Right.  And then by the end of it, it's like, oh, he's not leaving at all. 
[00:04:30]  Well, you could tell, like, fuck the translation because, you know, there was, whatever, a couple hundred thousand people that knew exactly what he was saying.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Maybe the CNN or the MSNBC or the Fox translator might have been a little shaky.  A little off.  But, man, all you had to do is see the picture behind the speech, and you realize, uh-oh.  Yeah, it's like, oh, boy, they are not happy.  So he gave the power to the vice president who he put into place.  Some of the powers, yeah.  Some of the powers.  Yeah.  But then they're saying, though, he could take the power back any time he wants, which makes this a complete joke to the people of Egypt. 
[00:05:00]  And he said he, you know, he made a vow to Egypt to stay in office until September, and that is what he is doing.  He's staying in until free and open elections will be held in September, which I'm sure will be free and open and so legitimate with him still there.  And he can be part of the open elections again.  Of course he can, or his sons or whatever.  Any of that stuff could happen.  And the influence that he has over people, you know, you kind of corral him with fear. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And money and things like that.  That's why I don't think it'll be quite a democratic, free and open election.  No, of course not.  He might make the percentages slightly better for the people.  So instead of winning by 98.9%, he'll win by 92%.  But there'd be a Mubarak in there.  Yeah.  There'd be a Mubarak.  Did he say something like, over my dead body yesterday, too?  It was kind of like...  Did he say, I'm going to die in Egypt? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, he said he's not leaving.  He's not leaving, so he pretty much put exile out of the picture.  And he will stay in Egypt, and he will be buried there.  When he dies, that's it.  He will be buried in Egyptian soil, because he's proud of Egypt, and bloody, bloody, blah.  And that's it.  And then he goes off, and the people get pissed.  And then the new vice president, slash maybe president, comes out and told people to go home.  Yeah, that was my favorite part. 
[00:06:30]  Go home.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing to see here.  Turn off your satellite televisions, because they're troublemakers.  They're troublemakers, and they're influencing you.  Go back to your jobs.  When he told them to shut their TVs off.  He sounded a lot like the dope down the hall.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Shut it off.  I hear what you guys are saying.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Nothing to see here.  Everything's going to change.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  And yeah, he was...  Mubarak was promising change, and don't worry. 
[00:07:00]  He blew out some numbers of some amendments of their constitution, and we took care of  number 15, 16, 17, 22.  I don't know.  Just fucking drag him out of that palace.  Well, here's the deal.  It seems like there's enough people there that want to die for the cause, so there you  go.  Go for it, man.  Someone's got to go for it.  Someone's got to start it.  You're going to lose your life, but the people behind you, man, they're going to be all  in, and they're going to drag that old man out of that fucking palace by his ball bag. 
[00:07:30]  Here's what's got to happen, though, because it's a stalemate right now.  You got the military that no one's sure if they're loyal to Mubarak or the people, and  then you got the people who are protesting.  They want Mubarak out.  They're not leaving.  If anything, more are showing up.  So you can't just have that, which has shut the country down completely.  The unions have stopped working.  There's no food in the markets. 
[00:08:00]  Their stock market is closed.  Their money is plummeting.  And nothing's getting done.  They can't go on like this.  So something's got to give one way or another.  Either Mubarak or the vice president has to see if the military is with them and send  them in and quell this, or the people have to attack the palace, literally drag him out  of there, and put anyone in place, some kind of interim government, maybe run by the military 
[00:08:30]  brass.  Well, let's put the scenario in Tropico and see how it plays out.  Yes.  Well, the new Tropico isn't out yet, so we've got to wait for that.  But it's coming out soon, I think.  We can't go old school Tropico?  We could go old school.  Presidente, the people are angry.  Right.  I think in old school Tropico, you see those tiny little dots that are supposed to be people  firing guns already.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know where they're supposed to get their guns in Egypt.  And then you've got to click on your tanks and move them in and click on your military 
[00:09:00]  and send them in to just squash the protest.  It doesn't seem like they have a lot of guns in Egypt.  No.  They have the rocks.  The people.  Why aren't the Egyptians pitching in the major leagues?  It was just a dumb thought I had last night.  Good arms.  If you have so many people that know how to throw rocks, you've got to think one of these  guys could throw 100 miles an hour.  Any rock-throwing country.  Why aren't they in the major leagues?  A little too wild?  A little too wild?  The people from Hamas.  Maybe because they can only throw at heads. 
[00:09:30]  They can only throw at heads.  And then the pitcher would be out there wearing a bread hat with a baseball logo on the front.  Wouldn't that be great?  Like a big bread hat with a Boston Red Sox logo.  But you have to change because when you go to take your bat, you've got to put on your  batting bread.  Your batting bread with one ear covered.  And then when you're pitching, you need some bread where you can put a little Vaseline  underneath your bread brim.  You think that's the only way they can pitch?  Just a Yankees bread logo. 
[00:10:00]  The only way they can pitch is to fucking get their weird helmets on.  You know what they do?  They put their bread hat in a toaster and toast the logo on the front.  Oh, that's nice.  And then you can wear it.  Oh, like how they make a depression so that everything toasts around it and you get a nice  line.  Right.  You get a nice line through it.  And then during the game, you could peel off a little piece, put it in your mouth and  put it in between your cheek and gum for real bread pleasure.  Pitcher could put a little butter on his thumb.  And the guy goes, I'm just, I ate bread and butter. 
[00:10:30]  What are you talking about?  I'm not throwing a spitball or nothing.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  So this has to end the stalemate in one way or another, but it's got to end with some type  of violence.  You know, you were just talking about, you know, bread helmet guy again.  Bread helmet guy.  I love him.  This guy just tweeted, Patrice is the bread head man.  Look at this.  Patrice is bread head.  Hey, smiling, Patrice.  He did it for a bread helmet.  He did pretty good, man.  Bread helmet with his arms up in the air.  I'd promote your Twitter, but there's like underscores and all sorts of shit going on. 
[00:11:00]  Why would you pick a name like that?  The with that line that goes low.  Oh, I think he's 27.  Is that underscore?  I don't know.  Is it an underscore?  I hate the underscore.  Hate the underscore.  We use so many keys now that you never used on a typewriter or stuff like that.  The internet has introduced keys that just never got used.  If you ever saw an old typewriter, the one, you can't call it a letter, the one key on 
[00:11:30]  the typewriter that would be brand spanking new is the at key.  The ampersand.  Everything else would be worn out.  Yeah, you didn't use that.  Never.  And like you said, I think last week, it is the most used key on every keyboard now.  It really made a fucking comeback.  Wow, did it.  It went from adding machines in accountant's office.  You sold 1,000 widgets at 53 cents a piece. 
[00:12:00]  If you ever...  Yeah.  When we were growing up, if you saw that at sign, you know you were dealing with a nerd.  That was boredom.  Boredom.  Yeah, even better.  Boredom.  Now it's like, wow, okay, really?  So...  You gotta use it every day.  You know, I...  I'm frustrated by this Egypt thing.  I want something.  And it's not about me.  Something's gotta give.  But as a TV watcher, I want something to happen.  Yeah.  There's tanks in there.  But they're just like...  But they've been sitting there forever.  And they keep yelling, we're one with the people. 
[00:12:30]  And they're one with the army.  Egypt army says ready to lift state of emergency.  What?  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means.  I really don't know.  Because what does that mean?  I don't know.  You think the people are obeying a state of emergency thing?  They're enraged by Mubarak's refusal to step down.  Organized the biggest demonstration yet in Cairo today.  Yeah, but today's happening.  That's the other thing.  Don't be confused.  We're only at 625 right now. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Over there, it's 125 in the afternoon.  Prime time to fucking yank his ass out of the palace.  Let's go.  They do stick up late, though, these people.  Don't they?  Like you.  Yeah, they're very late people.  You would do well in Egypt.  I know.  It'd be great.  Fucking...  No, but they get up early, too.  That's big.  One guy was...  One guy I saw this morning had a guitar.  And he was doing like a Bob Dylan kind of protest song.  Was he?  I think.  It was like Woodstock.  How could you tell?  But, I mean, I saw the guitar.  I saw the people.  So I'm thinking protest song. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  You see what they've done to their little...  Square?  Their little square there.  It's a shanty town.  They've built a whole shanty town with bathrooms.  Because I was wondering.  I was like, that's a lot of fucking people to sit there to not be able to piss and shit  somewhere.  Yeah.  But they built all kinds of bathrooms and tents where they're making food and sitting  there singing Egyptian hippie music, I guess.  Kumbaya?  Kumbaya.  Are they doing a kumbaya?  I think they're doing a kumbaya.  And...  But I don't know what... 
[00:14:00]  Oh, uh...  How does this end?  Kevin from Connecticut is claiming responsibility.  Oh, it is Kevin.  It was just retweeted by that other guy.  All right.  Kevin from Conn, C-O-N-N, did the Patrice Bread Photoshop.  Thank you, Kevin.  Always a pleasure to get something from you.  So, I see some violence happening at some point, but...  Today?  Today's the day.  No, maybe not today.  Then it's not happening.  But then what?  Do they all go home?  Yeah, because I think they work on weekends.  I'm not even joking.  That's a great gig. 
[00:14:30]  I think they get Fridays off.  But no one's got any jobs, and all the labor union joined the protest, so no one's working.  You get the bigger demonstrations on Fridays, because everyone's off.  And then you got the people that are sort of still responsible, like, fuck that.  I got to go to my pyramid-making job.  You think there's a big industry in pyramid-making?  I have a feeling they're still building pyramids.  We just don't know about them.  Because the new pyramids, you know, who wants to see a new pyramid?  You want to see something that's been there forever.  See the old ones. 
[00:15:00]  Of course.  Although no one's going to see them.  They're saying that tourism is so down, because who the fuck is going to travel there,  unless you're Indiana Jones at this point?  No, if you have dark skin, you could get around there easily.  Yeah, you think you could get away with it?  Yeah.  That's the curse of being as white as I am.  I can't go anywhere.  You can't go overseas anywhere.  If you've got, like, darker hair and your skin's a bit olive-y, you could go anywhere in the world.  And no one's going to fuck with you.  You have to just claim Canadian.  Right.  You have to say you're a hockey player from Canada. 
[00:15:30]  I'm too pink, man.  And borderline ginger.  Yeah, if anything got fucking hijacked, you would be the first one to be like, passport.  And you'd be like, oh, here it is.  Here's my nice blue American passport.  Right.  I can barely leave the Upper West Side without problems.  I'm so fucking white.  Oh, it's beautiful to be white.  Oh, white.  Oh, the color of God.  It's just like Jesus.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  So I don't know.  That's how we start today.  More frustration from this TV watcher.  Yeah.  Because we're not getting the big finale to this fine TV show.  I think maybe around five-ish their time.  I'm thinking like dusk-ish.  Because Molotov cocktails aren't very impressive during the day.  Oh, man.  The night footage is cool.  The night footage.  You see some fires and stuff.  Yeah, when they start throwing fire.  You think?  That's pretty good.  Wait, you know what?  How about this? 
[00:16:30]  Do they sleep late?  So maybe they're just starting their days.  That's a lot of people.  They were out there already with their prayers and stuff.  I know, but maybe they're just kind of warming up, having their Egyptian coffee.  Yeah.  I learned there's something called Egyptian coffee.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's like rocks.  Everything's just made of rocks.  I'm thinking it might be on the muddy side.  They're like the Flintstones over there.  Everything's just made of rocks.  Maybe they get up late and they're just kind of like warming up in the square.  Oh, I can't hurl one rock before I have my Egyptian coffee. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  I would assume Egyptian coffee fucking makes your dick stand up.  Oh, I bet that is some fucking energetic shit, man.  I would imagine, man.  You could hurl plenty of rocks.  I'd have to swig in that shit, man.  It's got to be some kind of espresso fucking...  It's just strong.  You'd probably chew it.  There's coffee grounds in there.  Something tells me their filters aren't very good.  They'd probably use their hands.  Oh, look at the Google image of the Egyptian coffee.  Wow.  I wouldn't mind trying that. 
[00:17:30]  I think that's what Indy and Belloc were drinking when they were having a meeting in that restaurant.  It's bubbly.  Yeah.  It's so brown.  It's brown.  That looks like oil.  It looks like they're just drinking oil.  It really does.  So...  Oh, those Egyptians.  President ain't leaving.  Everyone in the world completely shocked.  They thought they were going to have a different outcome yesterday.  The vice president trying to calm everyone down.  Yeah.  They don't want the vice president.  They don't want Mubarak. 
[00:18:00]  But once again, because we know more than anybody else, there's a problem.  There's no one stepping up is what's delaying this whole thing.  And that's the vacuum that the Muslim Brotherhood are waiting to fill.  Right.  They're sitting back and they're saying that they are a very open liberal.  They're not fanatics.  Yet former members do include Osama bin Laden and some pretty hardcore terrorists.  They vow to go to war with Israel. 
[00:18:30]  Killing Jews is one of their favorite sports.  And they're just sitting there waiting for a time to step in.  Yeah.  But you've got to have a second guy before you start your revolution.  Yeah.  That's where they made the mistake, the Utes of Egypt.  Like Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution.  You knew he was the second guy.  He was the guy.  Or the guy that was waiting in the wings.  Yeah.  They don't have anyone waiting in the wings.  And I think that's the biggest problem here. 
[00:19:00]  That's the problem.  Let me ask you a quick question.  And how you lean politically, I understand.  But the answer will be fine enough.  Like if there was a revolution in America, who's the second guy?  Who's the guy in the wings going, you know what?  Obama's got to go and everyone's going to rally behind me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's at least a few guys you would kind of like think about.  Yeah.  Right off the top of your head.  There is.  You'd have to have like a Mitt Romney.  A Mitt Romney, you think?  Could be there.  Could maybe rally the troops if things got really bad in America. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Shit like that.  Maybe that young guy that was voted in up there in Massachusetts.  Oh, right.  I forgot his name already.  Yeah.  Just something.  What about a Boehner?  Maybe a Boner.  Yeah.  What about the Boner?  Yeah.  Boehner.  How about, yeah.  He could just be like, I'll take over.  I left Dayton, Ohio with two bad knees and I dreamed to be the president. 
[00:20:00]  Dream came in June.  No one makes it great about Boner's crying.  Boner.  He just looks like a guy that should never cry.  That's what makes it so great.  So when you see that lip quivering.  Yeah.  You're like, wow.  He looks like a man's man.  Oh, yeah.  He's smoking and drinking and slapping broads.  Like, he doesn't look like the type of guy that would cry so easily.  No.  That's why it's so much fun.  Or how about we get Chris Lee to step up there. 
[00:20:30]  Chris Lee.  He could take a shirtless picture.  Chris Lee rules.  That shirtless picture up on signs in the crowd.  Yeah.  With his fucking, with his little arm.  Yeah.  Oh, that would be good.  He could step right in.  Invalid 216 on Twitter.  He writes, they've been in the state of emergency for over 30 years.  Yeah.  So that's what they're talking about.  So the state of emergency has just become their lives.  It means nothing.  It doesn't mean anything. 
[00:21:00]  If they take that away, what does that mean?  I don't know.  They're throwing rocks and doing whatever the fuck they want.  Look, there's cars on fire.  This crowd can't just stand here.  Here's the headline.  Anger reverberates.  And then what?  Yeah, what does that mean?  Then what happens?  You can't just stand around being angry.  You got to do something with that anger.  You know what this is like?  This is like watching The Sopranos and shit was like going to happen.  And then they'd go to Tony and Melfi's office.  Yeah.  And you're like, there's fucking 10 minutes left in the show. 
[00:21:30]  Stop with the fucking Melfi's office.  Are you telling me The Journey song is going to start at any moment now?  If fucking The Journey song is going to fade to black?  I'm going to be pissed.  They even flew Anderson Cooper back.  Yeah.  Because they thought it was going to be a big day.  Oh my God.  Friday of Martyrs, they say, is today.  What does that mean?  They call it Friday of Martyrs.  All right.  When is it?  When?  Where are the martyrs?  It's 1.30 over there now.  When?  I like how I also hope...  So look, now they're having a tug of war. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, that's a commercial?  Yeah.  Oh.  I liked how Mubarak was also saying he will prosecute...  They were saying persecute, but prosecute the people that caused the bloodshed and injury  in the square during this course of these protests.  He was very angry with that, and they will be prosecuted, and meanwhile, it's like, that  was you.  Yeah, you did all that.  See, that was you, you motherfucker.  You basically told them to run over the people. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  And I love...  He's saying only 15 protesters have died.  Yeah.  And the Human Rights Organization over there is saying at least 300.  Yeah.  At least.  They ought to get that Baghdad Bob guy to speak for him.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Remember him?  Remember the guy that was like, no, no, we still control the airport.  The Americans came in, but we pushed them back.  And meanwhile, there's just cargo planes flying into the airport, dropping off more American 
[00:23:00]  troops.  We have pushed them back and taken care of them.  Baghdad Bob, that was his name, right?  Yeah, like the best part.  Yeah.  Great.  You see all hell going on right behind him as he's trying to tell people everything's  under control.  He's like, everything's fine.  Don't worry.  I'm glad they never did anything to him.  Oh.  Oh.  Huh?  Little info.  When?  Question mark?  After prayers.  2 p.m.  Cairo time.  Are you shitting me?  Could you look that up?  Are they...  Are they... 
[00:23:30]  They have to pray until 2 and then maybe...  That's almost now.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, we might have to keep these TVs on.  Let me go to Road Dog.  Maybe he knows a little more on this.  Let's see this show.  Road Dog.  What's up?  Yeah, morning, boys.  Good morning.  Yeah, they just can't rush in there because Mubarak has got his own army.  It's called the Republican Guard, just like...  Saddam?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, so...  Even if they get by the army, they're going to go... 
[00:24:00]  They're going to have to get through...  I'm not saying it's going to be easy, like they're just going to walk down a hall to  his bedroom.  It's going to be a nightmare for people.  But what else are you going to do?  And I think at that point, I think some of the military goes, all right, let's do this.  Yeah.  I really do.  I think the military is very torn right now.  Yeah.  They're sticking together, but it seems like there's some cracks.  Some cracks.  Seems like it's slightly...  Some chinks in the armor, as they call it.  A little bit.  I think it's a little unstable right now.  Some chinks in the armor. 
[00:24:30]  But what do I know?  I'm not on CNN.  I'm on a dopey fucking satellite radio channel.  Oh, I do keep calling the ad sign an ampersand.  What?  It's not.  What?  I keep calling the ad sign the ampersand.  That's the and sign.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  There you go.  It sounded good, though.  Problem solved.  But it sounded good.  You could stop persecuting me now.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Sorry.  I'm making a mistake.  What are you going to do?  Sorry, Mike.  Hey, give me an Egyptian.  If you're Egyptian, call.  Why the kick-man punch? 
[00:25:00]  Punch me.  Do you pray until two?  Is that what they do?  Pray until two?  Pray until two?  I have no idea.  That would be weird.  All peaceful praying, and then at two o'clock, it's like, all right, let's get our fucking  angry faces on.  They don't look like they're praying.  I thought they were supposed to.  Don't Muslims pray like five times a day?  But it's not like an abundance of time.  I have no idea.  I think it's just like a 10-minute thing or something.  It's like a quick face mecca.  Another thing I was thinking of, because I've seen a lot of Muslims praying in the last few  weeks on TV, they must have great backs. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, to be able to stretch like that?  It would be nice.  My lower back is in horrible shape from years of caddying and being an athlete.  Yeah.  I think I might have to be Muslim, man.  Just to fix your back.  Well, because in rehab and stuff, I'm doing yoga poses, and I feel like I'm doing some  praying.  Yeah.  I would imagine they never have a stiff back.  They're stretching that back out every fucking day, five times a day.  They carry yoga mats around with them all the time so they could just do their prayers  wherever they go, whenever. 
[00:26:00]  Well, yeah, I tweeted that picture a few weeks, but it's probably about a month ago, but that  was the first time in all these years.  The cabbie?  All these years living in New York City, it was the first time I actually saw a cabbie pull  over.  I thought he was picking someone up.  He gets out of his car, his cab.  It's fucking freezing.  It's already December.  Yeah.  Throws the mat down, the rug, whatever you call it, and starts praying.  Yeah.  I never saw that before in all my years in New York City.  I knew it happened.  Yeah.  But this guy, and it was a busy street downtown. 
[00:26:30]  I forgot which one.  I've seen that before.  It might have been Broadway or something, or Seventh.  That's hardcore.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Because don't they try to find maybe more of a private place, private area where people  aren't going to gawk?  Yeah.  And I'll tell you one thing, man.  They got to figure it out because no one was messing with this guy.  I mean, no one.  Oh, yeah?  And I'm certainly not the toughest New Yorker.  You know New York has some tough people.  Not one fucker walking by said a word to this guy.  Why?  Was he a big guy?  I don't know.  I think it's just intimidating to see a guy come out of his cab and start fucking praying 
[00:27:00]  to Allah.  Oh, Allah.  Go to Allah.  Oh, Allah.  Go to Allah.  I also think you don't want to be called out for a hate crime.  The second you say something bad, it's like, ugh, a hate crime.  Yeah, I'm not saying, like, go all in hate crime.  Hate crime.  But I saw nothing but respect from people walking by.  You know?  They were just like, fuck, let's get out of this area.  I'm thinking dusk.  Right around dusk. 
[00:27:30]  Dusk.  Yeah, they're going to send, like, the children home.  You think he's even in the palace at this point?  They were saying that whole thing was pre-recorded.  So it gave him time to go somewhere else.  And you've got to think he's got some places to go, right?  Yeah, I think he smuggled his ass out of there.  And he's in another part of Egypt.  I think he's still in Egypt, but it's probably deep within the pyramids.  The great pyramids.  How cool would that be?  He's down there just talking to a mummy.  What do I do?  Pharaoh, what did you do when Moses came and took your slaves? 
[00:28:00]  You were bummed.  They wanted change.  He's just fucking, he's got his hand on the mummy's head.  Like fucking, like the gimp.  He's just tapping the mummy's head.  Like Zed was fucking flipping his fingers on the gimp's head.  He's like, what do I do?  What do I do, mummy?  Help me out here.  Do you feel it in your bones, though? 
[00:28:30]  Like, come on.  Do something.  It's Friday.  I don't want to be in front of my TV, you know, when I could be doing something.  I know.  Well, I'm going to have this on now the whole time.  If something doesn't start happening when we're here, I'm going to drive home, and then  I'm going to turn this on, and that's that.  All right.  Well, there it is.  Thank God it's Friday, though.  I should fucking put that on a bumper sticker.  It would do well.  Because now I could just go home and obsess over this, and sit in front of the TV for 
[00:29:00]  the entire weekend.  Doesn't the other guy that was with Zed look like Billy Mays?  I was going to say, it looks like the guy from American Pickers.  The American Pickers guy from Billy Mays.  A little bit.  A Billy Mays for anally raping big black guys.  I like Billy Mays a little better.  Billy Mays for the ball gag.  Do you have ass blood all over your khakis?  You need some orange clean. 
[00:29:30]  If you're pretty far from okay, you might need this samurai sword.  And comes with a free pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  Just pay separate shipping.  I'm Billy Mays.  He does it.  He's fucking Billy Mays.  He certainly is.  And a little Kevin Smith, we've said over the years, right?  Yeah, yeah, just a little bit.  A little bit.  He looks like he's tapping the Gimp's head.  Hey, did you watch?  Oh, you didn't have time to watch Catfish? 
[00:30:00]  Billy Mays.  That's Billy Mays.  No, not yet.  I was in town, as they say.  You live here, so you just say, I was here.  Or I was.  You were in town.  I say I'm in town, or I'm in NYC.  And I know the hardcores know why you were in town.  Of course.  But save it for everybody else after the break, because we want to take our time with what  you did last night.  I'll just give you a little hint.  It was fabulous. 
[00:30:30]  It was fabulous.  Nice.  We'll have a full report after the break.  Full report.  I know.  Catfish.  Our dumb discussion where me and Danny were kind of whispering, and Jimmy was involved  yesterday, turned a lot of people on to Catfish.  A lot of people.  A lot of people checked it out yesterday.  I was reading the old Twitter.  And people...  This is what's so funny about Twitter.  All right.  You throw a movie out there you liked, okay?  And then you get one or two people going...  Seriously, one or two people going, what a waste of fucking time. 
[00:31:00]  Thanks a lot.  Who the fuck would ever watch that movie?  And then, you know, if you took an overall reading of the Twitter, most people really enjoyed  it, because it was different.  Yeah.  And that's all I could say for now.  Yeah.  And they have their theories, and they're discussing it.  Is it real?  Is it fake?  If it was real, how much of it is real?  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm definitely watching it.  But then you get the guy who's...  He wants to talk for the whole world.  Yeah.  Worst movie ever. 
[00:31:30]  I can't believe you suggested that.  Yeah.  No one likes this movie.  I read that a lot.  No one likes this movie.  No one.  No one.  It's like, well, a lot of people like it.  You didn't like it.  Or at least talking about it.  Which is fine.  And it's fine if you didn't like it.  But other people definitely liked it.  Wow, that is Billy Mays.  Danny just did the side-by-side of Billy Mays and the guy that was with the...  Holy shit, is that close?  In the pawn shop, I guess.  Is there a Billy Mays picture where he looks a little serious?  That's the only thing that fucks it up, because Billy Mays was always smiling. 
[00:32:00]  Because he knew how much fucking money he was bringing in.  I love that pawn shop they get into in fucking Pulp Fiction.  They ought to have that pawn star.  It's like, so, ball gag.  What do you want to do?  Pawn this?  Sell it?  Yeah.  I'd like to sell it.  It was used in a large black man's mouth as he was being anally raped.  I mean, it looks like a nice ball gag.  I'm not an expert on ball gags.  Let me call a buddy of mine.  He'll come in.  He's an expert on ball gags.  We'll bring him down here, and then we can figure out the value. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Sounds fair enough.  So you're saying this was actually used on Marcellus Wallace?  Do you have any verification of that?  Well, you know, at an auction, something like this could go for anywhere between $300 and $400.  Okay.  Thanks.  How much do you want for it?  $300, $400?  Can't do it, buddy.  That's auction prices.  I'll give you a quarter.  I'll give you a quarter for it.  That's all I can do.  I mean, if you want to wait three weeks to get paid.  Yeah.  They always say that.  I love it.  Guy's like, this thing, I would value it anywhere between $5,000 and $8,000. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  What do you want for it?  $8,000?  Guy's like, no, I'll give you $500.  Well, I can't go that high.  I'll give you $2 cash money.  All right.  Look, I got to play blackjack.  And then the guy walking out, well, you know, I got more than I expected.  You know, I was expecting the dollar.  You know, I wanted $800, but I'm walking out of here with two.  You know, I'm still happy.  That guy really is a motherfucker.  And I understand he's got to make his money and shit, but he motherfucks people for the 
[00:33:30]  value of shit.  I think that the pickers fuck people more because they'll haggle and argue over like what amounts  to a few dollars when they know they're going to like restore it and flip it and make hundreds  back.  So it's like, why are you arguing with some fat lady over five bucks in a barn somewhere  for a gasoline sign?  Just give her the $5.  From the 30s.  Seriously, because after all said and done, you're going to make $200 off that item.  So just shut the fuck up.  But all those little friggin' haggling dollar here, dollar here. 
[00:34:00]  I think it adds up.  Well, it doesn't add enough to buy two separate hotel rooms for those guys when they're traipsing  all over the country.  Some tells me they could afford them if they wanted to.  Those little hotel rooms.  Why be alone when you could have a companion?  You see him talking as just one twin bed in the middle of the room.  It gets cold in Iowa, right?  Yeah, you know, body heat.  Well, we don't know, guys.  We don't know.  I don't know what's going on there.  We don't know what's going on with those two. 
[00:34:30]  I probably should have saw them where I was last night.  Before the break, and then we're going to get into what Anthony did last night, certainly  after the break.  I'm embarrassed for myself today.  Oh, certainly.  I got to say, I think I get influenced when someone invites me to a special screening  of a movie.  Really?  And I have to officially say it.  And you, what?  You know this movie, Just Go With It? 
[00:35:00]  Of course.  It's the Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston movie.  You see the commercials all over the place.  It's the rom-com of the month.  So Rowling goes, you know, you want to see Just Go With It?  I'm like, not really.  And this is the real conversation.  I go, I don't really want to see this.  He goes, well, if you see the movie, then we'll get some of the guys from the movie to  come in.  I'm like, oh, that's cool, because there's some big stars in this movie.  Big stars.  Who wouldn't want to talk to Jennifer Aniston?  Who wouldn't want to talk to Adam Sandler, right?  Johnny Fontaine.  So I go to the screening in the Sony building. 
[00:35:30]  It's like, I don't know, it's way up in the fucking sky.  You're looking down on the street, and you're in this beautiful fucking movie theater.  Is that the one you've got to take 800 escalators to get up to the fucking theater?  All right, you've been there.  Yeah, I've been there.  We go there every once in a while.  It's not a movie theater for the public, which is just amazing to me.  It's this beautiful room for idiots like us and reviewers.  Every time I go to that theater, it reminds me of that Bugs Bunny, where Bugs was coming  out of his hole, and he was on that elevator thing. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, and it goes sideways?  He kept going sideways, and then up.  Yeah, as he's trying to get above ground.  That's how I feel when I'm going to that goddamn theater.  You've got to make so many turns and twists and elevate up.  You're right.  And then it only fits, I don't even think it fits 100 people.  It probably fits, no, it doesn't fit 100 people, because the seats are huge, and they go all  the way, it's just an amazing place.  Probably like 50 people could be in there.  And every time we go, there's maybe 10.  Yeah.  They're showing the movie for like 10 of us.  So I see the movie with Roland, and I go, I'm not a rom-com guy at all, but I'll sit 
[00:36:30]  through a rom-com every once in a while, you know?  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, okay, for what it is, this movie was really good.  Really good.  And then we had Brooklyn Decker come in, because I saw the movie.  Very pretty girl.  And the Nick guy, I can never pronounce his last name, very funny dude.  Yeah.  Nick Swartzen.  Swartzen?  Swartzen, right?  He came in and gave us great radio.  So in that way, it was worth it.  So then I opened up the papers today. 
[00:37:00]  We were supposed to get Adam Sandler.  I don't know what happened with that.  Whatever.  Oh, I'm busy today.  I'm, oh, let me sing a song about it.  I'm so busy today.  I can't come back on some beers today.  So I open up the morning papers, and of course, it's movie review day.  Yeah.  The first one I see, it says, Jen's bomb-com, a no-go.  A bomb-com.  They're calling it a bomb-com, Roland.  Oh, that's great.  A bomb-com.  They're calling it a bomb-com.  Thank God our translators. 
[00:37:30]  I've learned a lot about translators from Fedor, and from watching the speech, the Mubarak speech.  And Opie apparently speaks fluent Roland.  Because a lot of people can't understand Roland.  Oh, yeah.  We touched on this yesterday.  Roland can talk to me sometimes.  Danny said the same thing.  A few people.  And I've got to be honest, sometimes I have no idea what you're saying, Roland.  You've just got to pick up on it.  I don't know.  You've got to pick up on key words.  You can't listen to the whole sentence.  And Danny does a good kind of impression of it, but I don't understand sometimes. 
[00:38:00]  I have a problem, too.  And Roland's funny, and Roland likes to be funny all the time.  Yes.  So there'll be sometimes at meetings or whatever that we have to have where it's just kind of a serious setting.  And then Roland will chime in, and all of a sudden you just hear...  And you're just like...  And you're like...  Because now I've learned to just go, okay, and I'll just keep going.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like...  But in all reality, I have no clue.  More than half of what Roland says, I just...  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:38:30]  And I think that's why sometimes guests walk through this door, and we go, we never said yes to this guy.  I know, I know.  And it's like, apparently we did, when Roland went, yes, you go back, yes, you go back, yes, you go.  And I go, oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like we just booked somebody.  And we did notice, though, this is something that has gotten worse over the years.  Because we've known Roland for a long time now.  And I used to understand Roland.  I used to understand Roland, too.  Well, he's a little weak.  He's not eating as much.  He's juicing his ass off trying to lose a few pounds.  Are you juicing?  I think he's...  Sad.  I think he's feeling sad and very, very lightheaded.  Are you juicing at your ass, too?  Because I think when you juice, it's like really bad, right? 
[00:39:00]  It is bad.  It is bad.  I understand that.  Did you have a juice this morning?  No, I'm going to have it for lunch and dinner.  My juicer broke, so I have to buy it now, Generations.  You have to buy another juicer?  Well, I think it's a sign from God to stop.  You just said, I have to buy a now, Generations.  Yeah, but I understood what that meant.  What does that mean?  He needs to buy a juicer.  That's it.  I have to buy a now, Generations.  I don't know what that is.  His juicer broke.  I could speak to Roland.  And he just has to get another one.  That's all.  He's lying again. 
[00:39:30]  He's lying again?  He's lying.  He juiced for two days.  No, I juiced for two days.  You're not juicing anymore?  No, I am.  He did tell me that he eats a regular lunch and he juices breakfast and dinner.  Yeah.  But I see him.  He doesn't juice for breakfast anymore.  Oh, shit.  I had one bagel.  Oh.  Ooh.  Why don't you cut up some audio?  Oh, shit.  Our screening calls.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  We should book Adam Sandler.  Oh, damn.  I would, but he had burned out from us. 
[00:40:00]  Radio Row.  That's a sore subject here.  Radio Row?  Oh.  That's a sore side had tear.  No, it's a sore subject here.  I get it, too.  I don't know.  I've done a lot of radio interviews and he's burnt down on the radio thing.  I don't buy that, by the way.  That's a sore tear.  It's a sore subject here.  Sore subject here.  See, I didn't hear that.  I didn't hear that.  He says sore here.  I didn't hear that.  That's a sore tear.  I know this shit.  Like a sore tear?  Yeah, so if you want to talk to Sam, he's available now. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  I work here.  Do not call Rob that.  That's rude.  Jesus, Sam.  What?  Don't call Rob that.  See what I mean?  How Rowan always tries to be funny, like no matter what.  I know.  I understand what Rowan is saying, but sometimes he does come up with stuff that you just have  to process for a second, and then you figure out where he's coming from.  Sometimes I look at him, and I think maybe like, I need a hearing aid or something, because  I swear I'm not catching this. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, why don't you go crash your car?  Hey, oh.  Yeah, but that's because it's two things.  It's either something you never thought to insult someone with, or something that's so horribly  inappropriate that you would say, there's no way he could be saying that.  One of my favoritest ever Rowan things now is, what do you say whenever E-Rock keys up  his mic in the little office there?  Me, my food.  Me, my food.  That's rolling when you hear it in the background. 
[00:41:30]  And the best part about that is that it's a bigger, fatter guy doing it.  It doesn't matter.  It's hysterical.  And it's so background, but you hear it.  Oh, it's great.  E-Rock's not even close to being the fattest person around here, but he gets the most abuse  for it.  It's just amazing.  He's second fattest.  Kevin from Connecticut is calling Opie the Roland Whisperer.  Yeah, thank you.  You are the Roland Whisperer.  Well, Roland, you do like rom-coms, and you openly admit you like rom-coms.  I love this one.  Did you like this movie?  I love that one.  So, getting back to my thing, right? 
[00:42:00]  So I'm thinking, oh, this is a pretty good movie.  Some good laughs, blah, blah, blah, for a rom-com, and Brooklyn Decker's good to look  at.  Yeah, I could fucking promote this movie.  We had the guys in.  So then, like I said, open up the paper.  The first review, Jen's bomb-com, a no-go.  And then this paper gives it a half a star.  Oh, boy.  A half a star?  It says, don't go.  Because the movie's, of course, called Just Go With It.  And it says, don't go.  Big warning.  And Stan and Sandler reach new lows in rom-bom. 
[00:42:30]  Rom-bom.  They're basically saying this is a stinker.  And I'm sitting here thinking it's an all right movie.  So I think I get an influence when the fucking Sony people go, come on, sit in our nice  theater and watch our product.  Maybe they're pumping nitrous through the air.  I don't know what it is.  I was going to see Hall Pass last night at the Warner Brothers Theater.  Yeah.  It's on the bottom floor, nice, luxurious.  Yeah?  How'd that go?  It was funny.  Was it?  Oh, yeah.  Did you understand?  He said luxurious.  Oh, yeah.  You understood he said luxurious.  I understood luxurious.  Yeah, I got that one.  It came out as luxurious. 
[00:43:00]  They had Skittles?  Oh, yeah.  Did you juice them?  Exactly.  He's juicing Skittles.  Wait, wait, that's not on your juice.  It's not going to be hysterical.  It's just juicing Milk Duds and Skittles and just drinking a fucking-  Buffalo chicken sandwiches.  You just make believe the green ones are broccoli?  Yeah, fuck it.  Buffalo chicken's healthy.  Chicken and sauce.  Oh, the York-  Yes, chicken and sauce.  That's what my dad said when he was living off one artery at the end of his life.  Oh, my God.  Chicken wings are healthy.  It's chicken.  It is.  You ever see them make them? 
[00:43:30]  Enjoy your fucking life.  What am I going to do?  That spicy shit is coated on there with pure butter.  Right.  It's wonderful.  What?  And do we have to say that the chicken skin is the worst-  The chicken skin's on there and it's the fatty-  Worst thing you can eat?  It's the legs, which are the fattiest parts.  How about the part where they fry it for like 15 minutes in oil?  Yeah, exactly.  It's natural.  How many calories and fat grams in one lousy order of chicken wings?  No, this was a skinless-  Ain't no thing but a chicken.  A skinless and grilled.  Skinless grilled chicken wings.  It's drenched in buffalo sauce. 
[00:44:00]  Well, yeah.  Yeah, which is great.  Which is great.  And sauce to dip.  Yeah.  Which is made with butter, but that's fine.  Yeah, that's-  Wow, that's great.  So-  That's chicken wings.  Well, I think it's obvious that the problem is that the wrong people are doing the reviews  and that we should have more people like Roland or maybe Roland himself doing these reviews.  That's true.  I mean, Roland is-  He knows his rom-coms.  We should go to Rotten Tomatoes, but-  What's wrong, Danny?  You saw the calories?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  People go to Buffalo Wild Wings.  I've been there a couple of times. 
[00:44:30]  Can I say, over the years, I've heard that one lousy little order of chicken wings is the  same as eating an entire pizza.  Wow.  Really?  Really.  Eight slices.  Not half is pleasurable, though.  But what do you got on this, Danny?  It's a rule.  Where do you want to start?  Calories or sugar or protein or sodium?  Buffalo chicken pizza.  You ever have that?  Yeah.  You take Buffalo Wild Chicken Wings and put it on a fucking pizza?  I was very-  Your ranch on top?  I was very hesitant to try that, and I just tried it recently.  It was fucking really good.  You know what else is really good? 
[00:45:00]  Fucking ziti pizza.  Oh, yeah.  Like with the regotte.  They put that on there, and fucking like that, and you lift it up.  You can't even eat it like a pizza.  You need a knife and a fork, and you're so full and weighed down after.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  On the chicken wings.  Well, if you get an order of 12 wings at Buffalo Wild Wings, you're looking at your appetizer.  That's warm-up.  Well, Roland-  No one eats just 12.  If you're eating wings-  No, no.  You're going. 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  Roland's warm-up consists of 600 calories and 360 from fat.  Wow.  40 grams of fat, which is 62% of your daily.  Wow.  I still have 40% left?  120% of your cholesterol.  Look at that.  It's not a game show where you're trying to get 100 of everything.  Look at the cholesterol.  120%.  120% of your cholesterol.  Most people laugh at 12.  They'll go 20 easy.  150% of your sodium for the day.  150% of your sodium. 
[00:46:00]  56 grams of sugar, which is like having a liter of soda.  Cola.  I don't want a liter of cola.  Wow.  Well, you could have a large farmer, but it's still going to be 56 grams of sugar.  I want a large farmer.  I want a liter of cola.  What about protein?  A large farmer.  56 whole grams.  56 grams of protein, Ron.  That's good.  That is amazing.  That's a lot of protein.  That's my walk.  You know what?  The sodium and cholesterol level being well over 100% for each of your daily is crazy. 
[00:46:30]  And that's just 12.  That's 12.  And usually you're going to have at least 24.  And hang on.  That's also, I think that those numbers are dry, no sauce.  Holy shit.  Yeah, because then you could get the sauce.  That's just the wings.  Oh my God.  No.  Yeah.  Do you got numbers on the sauce?  Kind of.  Sort of.  Like it says here like the spicy garlic sauce.  It says 25 calories.  But I don't know what that means.  I don't know if that means the whole thing they give you or if like what they're saying is like a dip of sauce. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know what their measurements are, so I don't know what that 25 calories means.  And who doesn't fucking eat that sauce?  Like you sponge it up.  Oh yeah, you dip it in there.  You just sponge it.  Yeah, I mean don't you have to like order extra sauce like every five seconds?  Oh yeah.  That little cup they give you, that's not enough.  You need shots of sauce.  You got shots.  So I'm embarrassed that I was promoting this movie there, Roland.  It shouldn't be a one half star movie and you were fucking.  Like I said, I think when they treat me nice, my brain goes somewhere else and I think I'm seeing like a fucking. 
[00:47:30]  You thought it was Citizen Kane.  Yeah, exactly.  The way you're talking about it.  This movie is shit.  Oh, I don't think so.  With stars like Brooklyn Decker and Nick Schwartzson, how could it not be funny?  I'll still say she looked amazing.  Yeah.  Not a bad actress.  And Nick was funny in the movie.  Yeah.  There you go.  You know what I was given a copy of yesterday?  That fucking Maxim with Michelle Trachtenberg on the cover?  Yeah.  Dude.  She has fucking just turned unbelievably awesomely hot. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  That picture of her with her fucking tits.  And that's her early picture.  She's gotten better than when she was in the bikini in that movie.  She was one of the judges when I was on Nickelodeon.  She was much younger.  No way.  When you flipped that fucking coin off your ankle.  She was there.  She was one of the judges.  She was like 14.  Damn, look at that.  Look at that fucking...  It just fucking looks great. 
[00:48:30]  God.  That's a really nice pick.  That's a hot little Jew.  She really is.  Is she a Jew?  Oh.  The Jew.  Jew me.  That's what I say.  Nice.  Look at her with her red lips and her fucking cleavage and her fucking ass.  Look, please.  Fucking tits.  We're stalling.  Vagina too, yeah.  Her vagina.  She just has a vagina under there.  She's laying on the big lips couch.  Oh, yeah.  Who has she been known to a cohort with? 
[00:49:00]  Do you know, Roland?  You're in that entertainment thing.  No.  Who's she been spotted with fucking...  Who's fouled her?  She hasn't really been out that much.  Yeah, exactly.  She did a thing with...  A movie with James Van Der Beek.  No way that pussy stinks.  No way that pussy...  That pussy smells like...  Let me think.  Let me think what's the sweetest thing.  Like Cinnabon.  Cinnabon.  Like when you're walking in and you like...  Or when you're walking in Epcot and you pass by the cinnamon nut vendor and it's just sugar 
[00:49:30]  and cinnamon.  That's what that pussy smells like.  Why?  Happy.  It probably tastes like it too.  Really?  There might be something wrong then.  You think that it might be diabetic?  Yeah, it's horrible.  If it tastes like sugar and cinnamon...  Yeah, it shouldn't smell like that.  It's not supposed to smell bad, but I don't think it's supposed to smell like...  There's no way it should smell like cinnamon.  Like frosting and sugar.  You know what it tastes like?  What?  It tastes like your mom's apple pie. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, that is...  Sour.  I mean, delicious.  Tell your mom that I bet her apple pie tastes like Michelle Trachtenberg's pussy.  I'll see if she can make a...  That is such a compliment, by the way.  Maybe she can make like a pie crust shaped like a vagina next time.  She would do it.  She would.  She would do it.  She didn't just keep us happy.  You talk about a pussy smelling like Cinnabon?  Yeah.  I'm going to show you a pussy, my friend.  All right.  You want to see a good one?  Please.  There you go.  Oh, God damn it!  Oh, that's awful.  Oh, what's wrong with that one? 
[00:50:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  There's something just hanging out of it.  That's a beautiful pussy right there.  What is it?  I can't look at that.  Why, look.  It looks like a brain.  It's got a thing on it.  It looks like a medieval mace is hanging out.  That thing Braveheart smashed that guy's head with.  Holy shit!  Oh, it's disgusting.  It's a little bit of a growth.  Ah.  How big is that?  The growth looks like a grenade.  It's a softball.  Softball.  That's softball size.  It's hanging from one of the lips.  What's wrong with that?  Hanging from one of the lips. 
[00:51:00]  It just made me feel like yucky.  It's nice, right?  I went from Michelle Trachtenberg's apple pie pussy.  But think about it this way.  To a nicer pussy.  Look at that.  No.  You can do a lot with that.  Cauliflower pussy.  We have all kinds of pussy.  I bet nobody's touched that one, though.  So that one probably also tastes like cinnamon, right?  That's right.  That's right.  No.  That's not Cinnabon pussy.  Cinnamon toast.  No.  All right.  Chop, chop.  Chop, chop.  We've got to get to break because Anthony's got to talk about his night. 
[00:51:30]  It was fabulous.  Fabulous.  Fabulous.  We're going to get a full report next.  Yeah.  Going into break with another Oscar moment.  A brand new one.  Oscar moment.  This is by far the best one so far.  Oh, really?  I've been liking these.  This is a real good one.  I've been liking these.  Why is this the best so far?  Because it's the funniest.  All right.  Let's just listen.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award nominated films. 
[00:52:00]  And now, here's Oscar.  Nominated for eight Academy Awards including performance by an actor in a leading role,  directing, and best picture.  The Social Network.  Presented by Patrice O'Neill and Rich Voss.  Let me rephrase this.  I sent my clients 16 emails.  The first 15, you didn't raise any concerns.  Is that a question?  In the 16th email, you raised concern about the site's functionality.  Were you leading them on for six weeks or something?  No.  Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before? 
[00:52:30]  It's raining.  I'm sorry?  It just started raining.  Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?  No.  Do you think I deserve it?  What?  Do you think I deserve your full attention?  I had to swear an oath before we began this disposition.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  I had to swear an oath before we began this.  Look, I had to swear an oath.  I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition.  I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition.  And I don't want to perjure myself. 
[00:53:00]  So I had the legal obligation to say no.  Okay, no.  You don't think I deserve your full attention.  I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall, they have the right to give it a try.  But there's no requirement for me to enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.  You have part of my attention, you have the minimum amount.  And the rest of my attention is back at the office of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intelligently or creatively capable of doing. 
[00:53:30]  Did I adequately answer your condescending question?  Now, go fuck yourself.  Stay tuned for more Oscar moments presented by the Opie and Anthony Show.  They try to take a little to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black.  But when I come back, you won't know, no, no. 
[00:54:00]  I got the time.  If my daddy thinks I'm fine, he's trying to take me to go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  I'd rather be at home with Ray.  I ain't got 70 days.  Because there's nothing, nothing you can teach me. 
[00:54:30]  That I can learn from Mr. Hathaway.  Did I hear it?  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-111.  That's 866-969-1969.  I don't respond to the dummies anymore, but today I feel like I have to. 
[00:55:00]  Jesus, don't respond to anybody.  I know, but I have to.  Yeah.  He goes, you saw a movie, you liked it, and then because someone said you shouldn't, you don't?  That wasn't the point I was making.  My God.  The point I was making was I think I get influenced when they treat me really well, so then I'm  confused if the movie was good or not. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  That was my whole point.  Outside influence.  Outside, right.  Yeah.  Because if the reviews are so bad, I'm like, oh my God, maybe the seats were too nice and  the theater was too nice and the service was too nice.  If you had to drive your ass to a movie theater and sit in a crowded movie theater and do  all that shit and slippery, sticky floors and all that, you'd probably be like, eh, this  movie sucks.  That's what I'm trying to say.  But they whisk you into a beautiful theater.  I'm doubting myself. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Like, was it a good movie now?  I don't know.  I guess I would say that I still enjoyed it, but if everyone's saying how bad this movie  is, I'm thinking maybe I do get influenced by the special treatment we get because of these  jobs.  I love the phrase there.  They coined a bomb comp or a rom bomb.  Either way, it works.  God, is that fantastic?  I'll tell you this much.  I don't go to an Adam Sandler movie to watch Adam Sandler.  Okay?  No.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Watch that fucking Brooklyn chick. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  You go to see her big boobies coming out of the water.  She's hot.  Enough of that.  But Anthony, last night.  Oh my God.  You're wheeling and dealing.  You're becoming a socialite, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're becoming a part of the fabric of Manhattan.  Well, you know, I've gotten on the inside here of something that I just, I have no clue  about.  Yeah.  The world of New York fashion, Opie.  Wow. 
[00:57:00]  The world of New York fashion.  This is something that is going on that we're just not supposed to know about or be involved  in in any way, shape, or form.  Um, but I am, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, going out with a, a runway model.  That's what she does.  She, she's a model, a fashion model.  and um so she had uh she went to the the richie rich

[00:58:30]  left he dresses like richie rich from the cartoon remember the cartoon richie rich rich was gay  well i always assumed richie rich was a little weird in the cartoon a little a little off  yeah i think if he was a little older his shorts were a little too tight they called him the poor  little rich kid yeah because he was richie rich i love that dumb comic growing up yeah richie rich  growing up you know it gave you things to think about he had some cash he was a kid he had all  the good toys it made you your dream yeah yeah like maybe someday i could be richie rich right oh boy

[01:04:30]  i don't know you might have i don't breathe on you yeah oh boy and it was freezing out yet i was  warm in this sea of homosexuality that i was in and uh the sea of love the sea of love and the doors  would open for a little while and they'd let like five people in and there's hundreds and hundreds of  people by the doors and there's three separate doors and finally walked in yeah there she's doing 
[01:05:00]  her snotty walk her strut walk um so i finally get in and make a beeline right for the bar and then  found my seat some of the chairs are turned upside down that old gag i can't get off of it but uh yeah  she's wearing a completely see-through top i was about to say her it's so funny it's like oh but it's  a model so that's okay oh yeah she's just strutting uh and and i i took my seat and just looked around 
[01:05:30]  i was like and then this richie rich guy comes out at the end with guys that look like they they  they should have been on stranded on a desert aisle and just took their clothes off and they were covered  in like this mud makeup and and like like two lines down their face what does that mean i don't know  but they had to explain what that means cocks they they were wearing the littlest tiniest thongs 
[01:06:00]  that went up their asses right and the front was just a bulge is it a fake bulge you think  no no this is all the real deal yeah because you could tell it was like they they would get to the  top of the stairs which was they had to go down the stairs before they hit the runway and uh they  they they would get to the top of the stairs and one guy would just kind of stop there and do this  pose on the banisters and then grab this fucking package and jiggled it a little and and you just 
[01:06:30]  heard like the gayest woo oh wasn't the women wooing no the guys were all wooing and what the hell  were they selling i don't know but they they was that what was part of the richie rich collection if  they're not wearing anything that was just for eye candy oh like they weren't selling anything they  were just there for to to whoop up the crowd oh so they walk out there was a tranny doing interpretive  dance on the runway and then this guy with the giant cock in the the ball bag goes up they give each 
[01:07:00]  other a sensuous look in the eyes and start making out and again everyone's wooing and i'm like what  the fuck am i doing here holy shit it was the gayest thing i've ever been involved in  carrie the bronx right well he's on the line i don't have time for the fucking calls i don't want  to talk to anyone today he right he says did ann feel like a pageant mom are you like a pageant mom

[01:08:00]  lot of people out there that don't think you're born gay yeah but all you have to do is be in a  situation like that and there's no doubt in your mind that people are born gay you can't make that  shit up you can't no you can't just go through life and then go i'm gonna be gay so i'll make up  this right but these idiots on tv were like oh you know yeah that it's a choice and blah no man  people are born that way it's so obvious definitely matter of fact lady gaga's new song

[01:09:00]  to be part of the gay movement the gay society uh gay lifestyle that weren't maybe born gay right  but maybe like just kind of want to be gay they want to be gays so they kind of turn gay maybe  but they're not real gay i think but to be born gay i think that's your majority of gay i think yeah  i think it's complicated i'm not gonna try to say it's not but you go to one of these events and  you're like all right obviously people there's definitely people that are born gay and a lot

[01:16:30]  that gay uh well the obvious gay the obvious kind of gay thing that's stereotypical gay talk the  it's it's it's weird because yeah i think that's genetic now that i'm now that i'm older i finally  decided it's okay to have uh you know uh gay people in my life yeah i got two uh two two friends are gay  and they don't talk like that though uh really they're with each other and they don't not really  no no maybe every once in a while yeah but it's not the over the top i don't think i could be friends 
[01:17:00]  with over the top gay i'll be honest with you over the top gay flamboyant no that's rough like that  fashion show last night gay like there's no way that's where i finally accepted that it's okay to  like be friends with gay people but yeah it can't be over the top gay that's that's where i'm at right  now last night they were so over the top gay that if you sucked half of a cock right they would be like  oh you're straight oh stop like if you just put half the head and half the shaft in your mouth 
[01:17:30]  uh they would look at you and go you're so straight what do you think though do people um  talk gay on purpose or they or that's just how they talk i think that's part of the gay it's like  it's like uh they say the the you know the black dialect where it's like black people have a certain  way of speaking where where if you didn't see the person yeah the majority of the time just listening  to the voice you would know if it was if the person was also or and and gay is the same thing it's 
[01:18:00]  sort of uh you sort of have it but then you push it a little bit yeah yeah yeah i'm thinking that's  the answer i think yeah it's just this effeminate kind of speech right i don't know what it is let  me go to charlie in tampa charlie hey what's going on boys hey listen my nephew when he's about six  years old uh he started playing with some dolls and hello kitty and all that other garbage  oh boy yeah so then his mom his mom took him to a psychologist and uh first they thought he was 
[01:18:30]  kind of conformant you know he didn't want to be a little boy so halloween would roll around and all  my sons were gangsters like al capone gangsters and he wanted to be a flapper from the 20s  yeah it was funny bro i see him walk in the house and there is like a flapper you know selling  cigarettes and shit so anyway he finally came out of the closet about 12 years old and now he's into  ballet he doesn't sound gay he's a great kid but i agree with you all beware i definitely know  what from what i know my experience is that you're born gay man it's sad that you had to say he's a 
[01:19:00]  you said he's gay but he but he's a great kid i say yeah yeah it's all right i didn't mean it like  that man like you know i i teach and i also see a lot of kids who we suspect they're gay and have a  lot of problems a lot of emotional problems right you know they get into trouble and shit like that  but this kid is who he is and he's just you know whatever man you caught me i guess you know by saying  that he's gay though is uh it sounds like you're supportive is his uh parents supportive yeah without a 
[01:19:30]  doubt in fact they even got gay role models for him man they go what they have gay role models for  him believe it or not many guys in my neighborhood you know i guess you know they're role models and  that's the way his mom puts it he's like these guys are role models for him is he like uh is he  like a little uh billy elliott is that what he's doing the ballet and the dance and the i guess so yeah  i guess so that movie like get out that play yeah but he's you know again man yeah he you know he was  like uh you auditioned for the nutcracker up in in i don't mean to laugh yeah i don't mean to laugh 
[01:20:00]  audition for the nutcracker because i'm still that asshole from long island that was so close-minded to  everything now that i'm older i'm trying to open my eyes finally yeah no he's a great kid man my  open your ass oh your eyes you know my son had issues with it because he was a little like you  know taken back from it but now it's you know it's it's you know he doesn't want to play hello kitty  or anything like when he comes over but he's uh right it is what it is yeah how do you come out  at 12 wow yeah i don't know that's like i'm done no pussy for me i won't even try it yeah you gotta

[01:24:00]  is uh  parties with fucking sorority girls  yeah  keg parties  but you have to go through the fucking  the gay obstacle course  why do they put you through the gay obstacle course  i don't know  just so you can get to the fucking  uh light at the end of the tunnel  i don't know  other fraternities were way worse  dark brown smelly tunnel  there were rumors of other fraternities  i don't  i swear to god  i have no idea if it's true  but yeah  with like fucking um  uh like uh  wax lips  oh you had a blow  with blindfolds 
[01:24:30]  wax lips or something  i swear to you  it wasn't my fraternity  well i would hope not  swear to fucking god  but i mean we  we did get paddled  like just weird gay shit  yeah  this is really gay  who  and i think it just started  where one brother  just happened to be  gay  years and years ago  and had  so much power  to change everything  one evil gay guy  one evil gay guy  why else  that's funny  i'm not just talking  from my fraternity  i mean i could  i could  we could do an hour of radio  with fraternity guys 
[01:25:00]  going yeah man  we had to do some weird gay shit  gayish shit  in quotes  yeah  this uh  the whole paddling thing  is very homoerotic  like the guy has to paddle  the other guy  like an animal house  thank you sir  may I have another  that's weird  and they're all looking  like like  they're turned on by it  well you have a blindfold on  so  yeah  and then you know  one of the brothers  had to fucking volunteer  to be paddle guy  so what's that about  he's probably hard  as a rock in his pants  you think in the meeting  they're like  yeah i guess i'll be 
[01:25:30]  all right  if no one else  is gonna do it  i'll be paddle guy  this year  if no one else  wants to paddle  the guy's asses  i'll do it  right  the only ones in college  that aren't gay  are the nerds  the nerds  yeah even the jocks  have to shower together  and just soap up  their big mules  and  i hate that  soap them up  just yeah  could you help me out  could you get my back  yeah no problem  just men watching each other  never ever felt comfortable  midnight express  when i ran cross country  we had a guy on the team  he'd made everybody  so fucking depressed 
[01:26:00]  in the locker room  like giant cock  fucking giant cock  and then you're  you're doubting yourself  you're like  fuck it's supposed  it's supposed to be like that  and i'm cursed with  and i know i don't have a small one  he wasn't fluffed  but at the time i'm thinking  fuck maybe i do have a small one  giant horse cock  and he would be oblivious to it  just showering  dude i was 13  and went to juvie hall  and had a shower  with two 18 year olds  oh boy  i'm gonna talk about  fucking not knowing  what a dick should look like 
[01:26:30]  i thought mine was the norm  just like fuzz  and just a little mushroom cap  and these guys had a hang  there was some arc  there was some arc to it  there was some arc  yours was just straight out  just straight out  and they had these big  fucking bushes  that was scary to me  yeah  showering with dudes  is a fucking  i know that you're supposed  to be not gay with that  but that's fucking gay  there is no way  i would ever  i didn't do it in gym class  i didn't do it 
[01:27:00]  at fucking  look  at the gym  when you're working out  after you get out of school  there's no reason  it's a great bit  that we could get into  because you know  evil gay guy  in the fraternity system  long long time ago  right  and also  the architect  for fucking  locker rooms  why do you have  showers that are open  like that  yeah  they didn't have to  have that design  but it was probably  some evil gay architect  i bet it's the same guy  mr brady  yeah there you go 
[01:27:30]  mr brady  architect  he designed them all  my high school  it was just a  wide open room  with a bunch of showers  like he didn't have  to have that design  so who came up with that  evil gay guy  the smallest showerhead  ever  just so there's  more room to see cock  you can't get a good  fucking flow of water  over you to  maybe distort the look  people don't think  you went to a modeling  show last night  they think you're  just talking about  a seinfeld episode  oh really  yeah  oh that i 
[01:28:00]  that i took a picture  of my fiance  i clipped it out  yeah  my fiance  she died  and he said  you want to dance  i'm on the inside  jerry  this phone call  can only come  from boston  joe go ahead  hey what's up guys  hey man  when i was about 10  my friend and i  lived across the street  we had never kissed  a girl before  she's like  fuck it  let's make out  so  we're out of my  front lawn  and right as we 
[01:28:30]  started making out  his fucking dad  across the street  throws it  his dad's in a  wheelchair  throws open the  window  goes  faggot  slammed the window  wait a minute  you kissed  one of your  friends  just because  you wanted  to kiss  something  yeah we had  never kissed  a girl before  so we're like  what's it like  so you know  well it ain't like  kissing a guy  yeah but he  doesn't know  at that age  how did it feel  for you  uh  i don't know 
[01:29:00]  it was kind of  we kind of  we had a hard  time committing  did you close  your eyes  i don't remember  i think so  oh god  i was kissing  like girls  though at like  seven  like at seven  in the basement  of our apartment  complex  it was like  making out  with this little  mexican girl  from fucking  she was from  new mexico  and uh  how'd you get  so lucky  i don't know  this chick was  like the fucking  she was the  project whore  at seven  she was just  kissing and then  and then she 
[01:29:30]  went with this  other kid keith  and started  making out with  him  i was all  pissed  i was all  bummed out  i'm one of  seven and then  my parents brought  it and that by  the way continued  up until like my  adult life  just being upset  like i learned  at seven  that chicks  fucking suck  you'll make out  with them and  then they fucking  making out with  your friend and  and you just  felt crushed  i felt that  feeling at seven  you really wanted  just to be in  love  yeah  something went  horribly wrong  something went  amiss  it was a guy 
[01:30:00]  that just wanted  one girl to  love him his  entire life  that's what  happened  unfortunately  the whores out  there ruined it  you always have  girls too  they wrecked me  you never really  stay off the market  too long  like i stayed off the  market for like  15 16 years  wow that's wild  and just i mean  one girl cheated on  me and i just went  and fucked anything i  could in the ass  suck tits and  whores and  prostitutes and  asian massage  parlors  yeah you're just  all in  yeah i just said  fuck them but 
[01:30:30]  you're a romantic  you liked uh  but it got  it got action  early what i was  gonna say i was  one of seven and  then my parents  were always  fucking i don't  know opening their  house to other  people and once  some we had a  black girl it was  just the weirdest  wow environment  what happened  what do you mean  with the black  girl yeah  nothing  nothing no she  was part of the  fresh air fund  oh god where  they'd ship out  yeah you bring  them in for the  summer so they  could like hang  out at a beach  or something  there's a big  thing in new  york i don't  know i don't  even remember  her name but  she was part of  our family i 
[01:31:00]  think for off  and on for the  summer i don't  even know if  she lived with  us i don't  know if that's  uh national is  it because i  know in new  york it was a  local thing they  would do that they  would have the  fresh air fund and  they would take  inner city kids  and uh these  suburban long  island families  would adopt them  for a summer and  it was called the  fresh air fund and  it was part of uh  no that's all i i  it's also called  get your house  spray painted fund  it was part of uh  the the catholic  religion because  then you brought  your black to the  uh the big 
[01:31:30]  your black you  brought your black  to the big uh  catholic pool the  church shindig to  the big catholic  pool oh i think it  was at the nunnery  if i'm not mistaken  on uh 25a i think  or they went to  camp alvernia for  the day i can't  remember this this  is a memory i  haven't thought about  in years but all  the uh the local  catholics that had  the fresh air kids  we all brought  our blacks to  the pool for the  day yeah which  was so weird because  you had these  ridiculously white  families and  everyone had a  black how fucking  overworked was the 
[01:32:00]  lifeguard holy shit  it was one of those  pools that must have  been a constant  whistle blowing and  a splash from the  lifeguard and some  fucking cpr and then  again oh my god and  then everyone was  like everyone was  displaying their  black like look see  we're not racist  because we got a  black oh we got a  black it was just so  oh my god it was so  phony man yeah i  remember even as a  little kid going this  is a such horse it's  just to look good in  front of your right  other church society  people i was young 
[01:32:30]  enough and i knew  these people are going  to be shut shipped  back to the projects  and we'll never hear  from again there's  going to be no  communications going  there's going to be  no letter writing or  phone calls it's just  this was all for just  show yeah in my in  my ridiculously white  community is like no  see look we fucking  do the right how old  were you yeah really  i uh probably uh  less than 12 and you  weren't you weren't  into pussy at that  time uh certainly i 
[01:33:00]  was oh you were but  you weren't into the  black pussy no that  was scary as shit  frightening at 12  scary are you  kidding me i was  scared of that when i  was in my fucking  20s still got the  fresh air fund huh  they do see the  little white kid with  the black kid and  the no way my point  though we had so many  kids always around  like anthony was  always finding girls  he could make out  and stuff i think we  just didn't have  anywhere to go i hung  around a lot of  whores when i was  growing up but you  had room you could  go into a basement  or something right  yeah yeah it was 
[01:33:30]  well it was an  apartment complex  plus down there the  super was probably  jacking in the corner  watching little kids  make out plus the  fact that my mom just  you know did loops  around the house  because she was  convinced one of us  was dying of  something so we  never had time to  ourselves wow  that's why i'm a  light sleeper man so  many nights waking up  because my my mom  in the house my mom  was right above me  seeing if i was still  breathing really that's  eerie fucking crazy so  it's this day man a  little fucking pin  drop and i'm up eerie i'm 
[01:34:00]  up jesus yeah that's uh  i was always like even  in california there was  always somebody that  just so i'm so jealous  of that i had a late  start dude i'm i'm  fucking jealous of that  horseback riding and  then it didn't help that  at 18 i still look like  i was 13 years old so  oh did the girls like  want to be a friend  because you were like  oh look it's always but  then it changed when i  turned 18 and i sort of  actually i i exaggerated  a little bit but i  looked like a 10th grader  finally when i was a

[01:46:30]  theater danny's gotta do a science bit yes how much hymen how much hymen is  walking out of a justin bieber uh and could it cover a football field yes you  think you could do that for us oh please i want to see the reviews you got  three stars and uh three stars who reviewed it is there any movies worth  seeing coming out well this is an inspirational story oh my god are you  i'm my name sam hi sam i work for the show how long you been inspirational 
[01:47:00]  i've actually been here counting from when i was interning it's approaching six  years all right well how is this fucking movie inspirational because they said it  would never happen why what he's he's he's he's able to play piano sing dumb  songs and play guitars as a kid and a drum and and he's got the look that every  teeny bopper chick would kill for because so it's supposed to be some no if he was a  burn victim or fucking you know a wheelchair uh that would be an inspiring story i have 
[01:47:30]  to raise my hand i know where this is coming from by well you it's very talented as a kid  you were way more talented than justin bieber yes your sister and your brother you guys thought  you were going to be the next partridge family or the next osmond family or whatever and it  never happened to i would i was just you didn't have the look they were looking for i had justin  bieber's look if justin bieber stood in front of a screen and someone sprayed marinara sauce  throw it with my fucking zits you should have got your hair conked he oh should i have yeah  the big is that why you get so mad because you probably had more talent than justin bieber at 
[01:48:00]  his age yeah but justin bieber has been worked at his for his whole life at this so did i i was  crying trying to do something with my life as a child with my father saying everything i did was  terrible he had supportive parents that's one big difference that's a big difference how inspiring is  is he had everything in place right lined up for him to be what he is how fucking inspiring is that  stop it can we uh can we play the trailer and by the way justin bieber fever is just about over 
[01:48:30]  because this trailer only has 2.8 million views 2.8 million that's nothing for justin bieber video on  youtube this is not the official oh it's not trailer channel this is the official trailer but  somebody boosted the trailer and just put it on their channel oh so this is a copy of a copy this  is like so so the original does have 50 million views probably this is a bonus 2.8 million this  doesn't even count all right oh fuck bieber fever is here to stay let's watch the official trailer for 
[01:49:00]  never say never it's an epidemic this is how i go oh uncle paul motherfucking can drum he's drumming  on a chair at like fucking three years old yeah but anyway we all did that yeah i like that  auto-tune back at the oh look they bought him pianos and when he posted his first video and i'll be his  fans and he posted holy shit that is the hottest chick i've ever seen in my life what what yeah 
[01:49:30]  usually stories how tough it is for adults he's 16 and he's doing it all on his own  he's not doing it on his own  he's best friends with usher yeah on his own inspiration he came from like such a small town  and it gives us hope when is usher gonna do something on his own i was once shown in my room  michael jackson justin bieber he should change his name to featuring usher right  this february he's living an extraordinary life but he's just like you and me he's not like you 
[01:50:00]  and me these little chicks all over him wanting to fucking suck his dick he's just like we were  yeah how inspiring i hate that just like you and me that's this is bullshit he's just playing  basketball yeah they make 3d movies about everybody does he have to go to school too just like you did  you can't live your dreams this is what i'm telling you never say  yeah holy shit i think i should have been a dancer really that's false advertising by the way he got 
[01:50:30]  lucky and he's he's saying to a hundred thousand people that this could happen to you too i'm gonna  go maybe one other person in the entire fucking arena that one person so going to the theaters with  a squeegee and just squeegee up the fucking vag juice off the floor and bottle it and you wonder  why you never made it and you wonder why you never made it you're a fucking curly head creep i'm a  degenerate but it just but the point is he wasn't all your fans anthony was not a creep ah something 
[01:51:00]  happened i uh let's do a justin bieber video what can we do in a movie theater with these young  oh my god i really should we really should do something with this movie opening yes i'm not going to  harass young girls in a movie theater it'd be great to just dress in a fucking dress in an old  gray trench coat like i'll go in an old gray trench coat sit like right up front and just be too  enthusiastic about the movie and keep turning around to people and nodding like you're right yeah a  giant bucket of popcorn over over my crotch and just asking young girls if they want some popcorn 
[01:51:30]  they just have the popcorn but it's it starts moving your hands are on both sides but it's moving  popcorn's moving put some kind of motor in there to fucking move the popcorn around you want some  popcorn we we could go the other way and do some investigative reporting and just wait outside the  movie theater for all the creeps to leave we know why the fuck are you in this movie just drop a  cinnabon on your pants before you walk in oh there's got to be something maybe interview some of the  little girls coming out do you guys really want to end it again you can do you can just interview the

Tennessee, you are my favorite place in the world.  Let me hear you.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  What the fuck kind of show is that, dude? 
[02:21:30]  That fucking asshole in the back was yelling shit out all the time.  It was supposed to be hot tea.  My throat is killing me.  His real name is Bob Kelly.  And we have a fucking audio of his act before he turned into Billy the Bassman.  How funny would that be if I became, listen to me, became the biggest thing in the middle  of America, and I fucking, I wouldn't even talk to you guys, acknowledge that it was true.  No.  At all.  I fucking wound up buying this tape, so the original, so you didn't have it.  I was on a giant bus with fucking tractor trailers with Billy the Bassman. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, but 10 years down the road, you guys come on my bus and I'm just crying because I'm  this fucking guy.  My wife left me.  You don't want to be Billy the Bassman.  I don't want to be Billy the Bassman.  I just want to be Bob Kelly.  It's not Bob Kelly.  I just want to eat.  Everywhere you go, they're just like, where are we going?  You're sitting in a fucking Denny's at 3.30 in the morning trying to eat some eggs.  Hey, Billy, where are we going?  You're like, my name's Bob Kelly.  Shut the fuck up.  Guaranteed that website is already bought.  You're a fucking dumb fan.  Some cunt just bought where we're going. 
[02:22:30]  How bad do you want to see Bobby actually do this and not break character?  I would love it.  One fucking set, one time.  But first of all, we'd have to come up with, you'd have to change your look.  You'd have to get the camo on.  You need a hat with fish hooks and a lot of fishing lures.  I would have to actually go on stage.  I think the microphone stand would have to be made out of a fishing pole.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Perfect.  Where are we going?  And every so often you talk about, it's like, yeah, I was out by my favorite fishing hole  the other day and you pick up the bike stand and you start like your casting and you're 
[02:23:00]  holding, you know, and I was fishing me and my buddy, you know, and he's like, where are we going?  I go, we're going to fish, you know, where are we going?  At the end of the show, I cast out t-shirts to the crowd with, where are you going on?  Oh, God damn.  This is such a great act.  You've got to sell where are we going t-shirts now.  You've got to.  Oh, someone's saying this fucking theme song.  Because I'm the bass man.  Dad, I'm a bass man.  I love to hook them.  I love to reel them. 
[02:23:30]  I love to catch them.  I love to bait them.  I love to kill them.  But at the end of the show, we just go around to old people and we have them go, so where  are you going?  Where are you going?  And they're just like, ha ha, Billy the Bass is my favorite.  And then you finally found hanging in your trailer.  That's my, but that's my, that's my demographic though.  People in like fucking lojacks.  Those fucking, not lojacks.  What are they?  Larks.  Larks.  Fucking bossing me.  Lark.  The best part of that whole fucking Billy the Bass man bit.  Yeah.  You, we could see your top teeth the entire time you were doing Billy. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You stuck your lips to your top teeth.  Can you know what?  I'd have to get those buck teeth.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I actually started my career with those.  Did you?  Listen to me.  I had buck teeth.  Sorry, Rich.  He's not even here.  I forgot he had fucked up teeth.  I always forget.  Wow.  I had the buck teeth and I used to go on stage and this was one of my jokes.  I used to go get these teeth and go into a hardware store and go, do you have a file? 
[02:24:30]  Wait.  Then, then, then I go, then I go, I go, look, a goofy, I go, look, a goofy vampire.  Duh.  And listen to me.  Oh my God.  But duh.  Duh.  I forgot the teeth one day and I had no act.  Dude, I forgot them.  I tried to make them out of a paper plate, but they kept getting wet and folding up and 
[02:25:00]  just being my regular teeth.  Oh, shit.  Fucking Bobby.  Regular prop comic.  Fucking Billy the Bassman.  Oh, Billy the Bassman's going to be a big kid.  Hey, where are you going to be for real, Bobby?  Robert Kelly.  Yes.  Robert Kelly, yes.  He's going to be at the Palace Theater in Albany tomorrow night, one show only, for Valentine's  Day special.  Where are we going?  Everybody in Albany is here.  Where are we going, y'all?  Where are we going, Bobby?  Bobby, Roger, he'll just be like, shut the fuck up. 
[02:25:30]  Shut up.  I'll come out there and fucking punch you.  I'm not Billy the Bassman, motherfucker.  Not yet.  Not yet.  I mean, fucking Opie becomes my manager with just multi-millionaires.  And Opie's got to, like, grow his hair long like fucking Custer and have one of those  fucking colonel mustaches and little fucking beards.  Anthony would be my other manager.  Kentucky Fried Chicken.  You're co-managers, but you'd just be you because you're a racist reg night anyways.  You'd just show up with a six-shooter instead of a nine. 
[02:26:00]  What would you do if your manager called you and said, dude, we're getting calls for  Billy the Bassman all over the place?  Could you just do it?  So funny.  You know, my management, if I did that, my management would fucking dump me.  I really love Billy the Bassman.  Why, man?  Fucking Larry the Cable Guy.  My new manager is just fucking Italian guys.  Billy the Bassman.  Imagine that.  You do fucking, you start opening up for fucking A.  Opening up, I'll fucking take over.  No, you start by just opening up. 
[02:26:30]  I'll be a dirty rendition of him.  Dude, you could get two.  Where are we going?  You could get two.  Run upside that pussy.  That's where we're going.  I pissed would he be.  You could get two paychecks, though.  You could start as Billy the Bassman and then come out as Robert Kelly.  And then eventually start as Robert Kelly and then end with Billy the Bassman.  I know.  I play my Garth Brooks.  No, we do one night as Billy the Bassman.  The next night, we do Robert Kelly.  Ah.  So one night would be full.  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  I like it.  Bobby, I haven't laughed that hard in a really long time.  That's a big laugh right there.  Bobby, I don't even know the fucking name.  I love it.  The jokes he gave me sucked.  I know the jokes.  Sam pulled up a bunch of jokes.  At one point, he's scrolling too fast.  And Bob just reached over and punched Sam because he wasn't scrolling the jokes fast.  No, but he scrolled past all the jokes.  And he scrolled to like fucking paragraph jokes and setups.  I just wanted one-liners.  No, I did this.  The fact that you just leaned over and punched him, though, was great. 
[02:27:30]  I'm sorry, Sam.  I didn't mean to.  That was funny.  I appreciate that.  Billy the Bassman would punch his fucking guy that wasn't working out for him right.  Unless I Googled really bad jokes.  No, I wanted really bad jokes.  But you fucking scrolled off that spaghetti joke.  I mean, the spa joke.  That was a good joke.  I thought you didn't want it.  Spaghetti.  Spaghetti is great.  That was a great joke.  Shoe fly.  I love that.  Shoe fly.  Because you added in.  You went, shoe.  Shoe fly.  Shoe fly.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  What's Mary short for?  She's got no legs. 
[02:28:00]  What's she short for?  That's like literal.  You wouldn't expect that.  What's Mary short for?  She's short because she's got no legs.  That's a riddle.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  That's funny.  But the where are we going covers up the bad ones.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  That's the beauty of the bit.  That's like, get it in.  I want to do more.  Where are we going?  All right, we'll do more.  Where are we going?  Maybe we'll end with a little more Billy the Bassman.  Oh, God.  I think Billy the Bassman should get his own show at 10 o'clock.  He probably is.  I heard Billy the Bassman just signed for $8 million here at SiriusXM. 
[02:28:30]  Why make a say now?  Hey, where are we going?  Now it's too real.  Now I'm saying.  Where are we going, Toby?  I just said, where are we going?  That makes it better.  I'd love to have this studio.  Yeah.  We're putting a smaller studio.  And we have to walk past and watch Billy the Bassman do a show in our old studio.  Just give me the okay sign.  Oh, there's just cowboy hats hanging and chaps.  Hot cowgirl chicks just fucking taking this shit off.  Where are we going now?  Big where are we going signs. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  Ah, shit.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy, and I'm a half-eared in Jim Neighbors with a wheelbarrow full of buttholes.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Get her done.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  SiriusXM.  Hey, I want to tell the people that we're bringing back Car Crash. 
[02:29:30]  Jesus.  Car Crash Comedy.  Thank you, Anthony.  Boo!  We love Car Crash Comedy.  It's been a while, huh?  Yes.  It's brutal, though, boys and girls.  It's brutal.  Yes, it is.  Take no prisoners on this one.  Yes, it's an opportunity, but it is brutal.  I want people to understand what they're getting themselves into.  Car Crash Comedy.  The O&A show is looking for undiscovered comics to compete live on the air for a $2,000 cash prize 
[02:30:00]  and a chance to perform on stage at the world-famous Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City.  But you've got to survive Car Crash Comedy to win.  Have you been part of this yet?  I think Bobby the Bass Man is going to be on that show.  Maybe he could be an honorary fucking comic star.  That would be great.  He might be on that show.  Yeah, Ant's playing the sound effect.  So you do your act, and if the panel hates your joke, and I think if you get three of those,

Borgata.com.  Yeah.  And speaking of comedy, in honor of Billy the Bassman, someone has suggested a fine  little Twitter hashtag game today, and we're going with it. 
[02:32:00]  So, if you're on Twitter, we're doing the hashtag, where are we going?  And it's where we going.  Where are we going?  G-O-I-N.  Okay?  Going.  You don't have to put an apostrophe or nothing.  And it's got to be one word, where are we going?  G-O-I-N.  Where are we going?  And basically how it works, bad joke, and then the hashtag, where are we going?  Pat from a hug, he goes, catchphrase is stupid.  Muff, muff, muff.  Yeah.  Oh, Pat. 
[02:32:30]  And the ones that have already started participating have turned it into a very racist hashtag game.  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.  Of course.  I wonder who started that.  Oh, Jesus.  Probably some s***.  Jesus.  Love the beep.  And people are like, let's get Billy the Bassman and where are we going trending.  Well, that's what we're trying with the where are we going hashtag game.  Once again, where we going, G-O-I-N.  One word.  You know what I love about this, too?  I get to block a lot of douchebags today.  Oh, yeah.  This stuff draws them out. 
[02:33:00]  Block Friday.  Yeah, the ones that don't really like you, they just come out and say some f***ing bye.  Some dumb s***.  Oh, I can't wait.  I love it.  I get fiendish with this.  Some dumb s***.  This guy right here, f***ing Jagerman, I only follow you for Billy.  I block you.  Goodbye.  I'm blocking bye.  You're saying it's things like this.  They're itching and they can't help themselves.  Oh, yeah.  It's like they're waiting like vampires.  There's people that follow you that probably love you and hate me.  Just follow me one day by accident and they hate me. 
[02:33:30]  I get the haters.  Everyone does.  You f***ing draw them out.  Drawing them out is awesome, though.  Yeah.  You say something and they're like, f***ing, f*** you, you s*** dick.  Bye.  Yeah.  I have one last week about my f***ing, I made pics for the UFC.  Yeah.  And he was like, you're a f***ing idiot.  You pics of s***.  It's like, that's not funny.  That's not even like nice.  It's not even being, you know, you're trying to be a goof.  Yeah.  You're just a dickhead.  I f***ing tweeted a picture last night from the fashion show. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  Of my girl when, right after she had her makeup done and her hair done and everything like  that.  And then, and I tweeted it.  It's like, oh yeah.  I go, this kind of makes up for all the gayness that's going on in this place.  And somebody actually tweeted like, oh, she should be on www.uglychick.com.  Yeah.  Really?  And it's just like, it's like, really?  Okay.  Bye.  And I just put like, really?  And then, and then block.  Like, why would I?  I put, this is how you don't get my, I came up with a solution to how you don't get my 
[02:34:30]  shitty UFC picks anymore.  And I blocked them.  Yeah.  There you go.  Blocked.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Just be funny.  Stop being so f***ing.  Oh, f*** yourself.  Yeah.  You f***ing.  So being so familiar with me like we're pals.  Yeah.  That's like, it should be on Ugly.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That picture?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Just do it.  Yeah.  Just go to Ugly.  It's like, what do you do?  It's like, just people.  Can't we all just have fun?  It could not be your dad.  You know what it is?  It could not be your tie.  We're all going to be dead within 50 years.  It's like, a girl cannot be your tie or you don't like or something. 
[02:35:00]  But like, Ugly is what it is.  Let's all just go back to having fun.  I want to see him.  That's the problem is that we are so exposed and they aren't.  You cunt.  We should be able to see your dad.  I actually did that to a guy.  He f***ed with me.  Said some mean s***.  Then I went to his Facebook and he had a baby.  And I was like, and I just wrote back, whose kid is that?  It's about to f***ing come down.  Hey, dude, I love you, man.  I was just, you know, f*** you.  Yeah, just joking, were you?  Yeah, I'd love to.  I found you, mother f***er.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Now I know.  Just all.  Let's talk a bunch of times.  I suggest we all just go back to having fun.  Let's just have fun.  If you don't like me or Bobby, it's all right.  Let's just have fun.  Yes, Danny.  I grew a conscience, actually, because some people, they'll talk s*** or whatever.  And then I go, and you obviously, like on Facebook, you'll click through to them.  Yeah.  And you see, like, they're fat and bought with some fat wife and fat kids.  And you know what I do?  You pray that they die.  I don't do anything.  It just makes me happy.  And I just go, oh, okay.  Because you kind of know they're miserable.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Miserable in that life.  When you look at the little chunk of their life.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin from Con, C-O-N-N on Twitter.  He's got your trucker hat.  Where are we going?  Where are we going trucker hat?  I'm telling you, dude.  There's something going on with this.  Where are we going trucker hat?  You better, Opie, you better have your lawyer buy that s*** today.  I don't know.  Copyright that.  That's up to you, bro.  Yeah, that's great.  Where are we going?  Yeah, we, uh...  Are you trying to find that guy?  Huh?  Yeah, I was going to.  Uh, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  That's great.  That's funny.  Yeah, you're going to find the guy.  Danny's great, man.  Let's look at this fatso.  If anyone can, Danny can, so.  Let's look at this f***ing douchebag.  That's what I want to see.  Ass hats.  I love that.  Oh, f***ing ass hats.  And then sometimes you just got to, like, be, like, blunt with somebody, because somebody  said, and which is fine for a guy to say, it's like, oh, uh, that chick would look better  dressed in my cum.  So then you got to put something like, oh, well then, uh, take some off your mother and 
[02:37:00]  give it to her.  You got to drag someone's mom.  I love dragging people's mothers into things all the time.  Yeah.  Like, that's, like, my thing, I guess.  Like, go f*** her.  Go f***.  And, and, and saying that his father is a homosexual and then putting blatant, like,  bad gay scenarios.  So it's got to, like, form in his head.  Like, as he's reading it, I want to paint a picture where he actually pictures his father  doing horrible homo things with his friends or something.  Yeah.  I do that on Xbox. 
[02:37:30]  I really paint a picture of his mother getting cunt cancer and her pussy just falling off  in front of him.  And as she's dying, he realized he got, he got AIDS from her, too.  As a child.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I'm trying to bring everyone together today.  You don't have to like everyone that's associated with the show, but let's just start having fun  again.  Yeah.  Fucking A.  All right.  Once again.  Just be funny.  Just be funny or a smiley face. 
[02:38:00]  That's all I ask for.  The hashtag game is doing very well already.  So once again, where are we going?  Hashtag game.  One word.  Where we going.  G-O-I-N.  Okay.  And some people are, are, are, are doing the G on the end.  No.  No.  No one's going to see your fucking tweet.  Here's a perfect example.  It's a great way to get followers, too, because now we're all looking at each other doing the  where are we going hashtag game.  Perfect example right here.  Denver Pest.  He goes, uh, did you hear the one about the guy with five penises?  His pants fit like a glove.  Where are we going?  That's a perfect.  I got one right here.  That's an awful joke. 
[02:38:30]  From, uh, Joe Galasso.  I don't know what the fuck his name is.  Uh, what's the name for, what's the name for a short girl?  Cunso-lo.  Where we going?  Where we going?  Cunso-lo.  It's Cunso-lo.  Asshole.  It's goddamn Spanish.  Where we going?  Cunso-lo.  Cunso-lo.  You called it Cunso-lo.  People should hate you.  Shut the fuck up.  They should hate all of us.  That's Han's sister.  Cunso-lo.  But that's like, it's one of the oldest jokes his mother gave.  It's one of the oldest jokes and he's all confident. 
[02:39:00]  Well, if you read it, I read it phonetically.  That's all.  As long as you say, where are we going?  I can't beat you up because you are the guy.  You are the best.  Wait a minute.  I read it phonetically.  Cunso-lo.  Cunso-lo.  I've never heard.  I've never heard the joke.  You can't pause either.  I didn't grow up in New Mexico, you fucking spick lover.  That's why I was kissing in the apartment complex.  Cunso-lo.  Seven.  Young Cunso-lo.  So, fucking Cunso-lo. 
[02:39:30]  So, obviously, bad one-liner joke.  Did I say Cunso-lo?  Bad one-liner joke and then the hashtag where we going, G-O-I-N, okay?  Oh, God.  And you might get followers out of it, too, because we look at each other when we're all  together.  Cunso-lo.  Cunso-lo, wow.  I got a bad feeling about this.  Cunso-lo.  Yes?  Oh, shit.  I can't. 
[02:40:00]  The other slide whistle did such a better R2-D2.  Oh, shit.  No.  Cunso-lo.  Cunso-lo.  Ah, shit.  I fucking stink.  We have to beat you up for that.  Hey, Cunso-lo, where are we going?  I fucking-  You were so excited.  I fucking read-  I got too excited to read it phonetically and I stink.  Fucking-  But, Cunso-lo makes me laugh, so I'm glad I fucked up. 
[02:40:30]  Because, Cunso-lo.  What was another line from the movie?  Cunso-lo.  Cunso-lo.  That's so funny, dude.  Cunso-lo.  Oh, there's some funny ones.  Yeah, they're rocking it, man.  They're rocking it.  Oh, my God.  And now they started the hashtag Cunso-lo.  Cunso-lo.  Did they-  Did they really?  Fuck that joke.  I'm not that bad.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I just-  Where are we going, Bobby?  I thought-  Where are we going? 
[02:41:00]  Where are we going?  Ah, shit, man.  Where are we going?  Put some milk on the signal and where are we going?  I apologize to poor Joe.  I read his fucking tweet on the air and I ruined it.  Danny, I'm going to change gears.  The gummy penis guy.  Gummy penis?  Yeah, I don't know this one.  Danny says it's really-  It's quite good.  It's interesting.  I guess they use different language across the world, of course.  They use different words for things.  Like they got a different word for everything.  So, you know, they're saying lollies throughout this whole piece. 
[02:41:30]  They're saying lollies, but they're not really lollipops.  They're really referring to, like, gummy candies.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so just when you're listening to it, just keep that in mind.  Every time they say lollies, think of, like, a Swedish fish or some kind of gummy bear.  Okay.  Love gummy bears.  These are funny, dude.  Oh, you're reading a bunch of them?  Yeah, but some of them actually would be actually legitimate jokes this guy would say, dude.  Oh, legitimate, like Billy the Bassman would say?  Yeah.  Never follow good whiskey with water.  Unless you're out of good whiskey.  Where we going? 
[02:42:00]  That's fucking David.  That is.  That's funny.  That's a good one.  That would be the exact joke you'd fucking have to write for this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Fuck, they're coming like, like, like, please.  Gangbusters.  All right, here we go.  What is this?  Oh, gummy bears, right?  Yeah.  Well, not bears.  Gummy.  It's gummy candy.  Gummy candy.  Bobby's over here just roaring.  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  This is another good one, dude. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, let me hear you.  I'll let you hear it, but I don't know if you're going to like it now.  Let's give it a chance, everybody.  I'll tell you now, letting the cow out of the bag is a whole lot easier than putting it back in.  Where are we going?  Oh, no, man.  Where are we going?  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is it?  There you go.  Why does it make sense with the accent?  I don't know.  And the where are we going?  And the where are we going.  It's so...  It's a brilliant goof.  It's fucking brilliant.  Yeah.  Now we know why Larry the Cable Guy is a fucking billionaire, basically. 
[02:43:00]  All right, yeah, let's play this.  Yeah.  A Christchurch mother says she was left bewildered after her son bought a bag of lollies from a local dairy with three penis-shaped sweets inside.  She says among the snakes in milk bottles were lollies that were really only suitable for a hen's night.  But, Juanita Copeland has more.  Seven-year-old Tyson Vincent thought he was pretty lucky to be allowed a lolly mixture from the local dairy last night. 
[02:43:30]  As he worked his way through them, his mum and dad noticed his mixture should have had an R18 rating.  And I was looking over and I just see my son putting a penis lolly into his mouth.  He said to me, like, Mummy, is that a penis? Is that a daddy part?  And I was like, yes.  A daddy part?  There were three of the penis-shaped lollies in the $1 mixture.  Where are we going?  At first we sort of laughed it off a bit, but it was afterwards I was thinking, this is a bit disgusting.  This is in my child's lollies.  Like, you know, the dairy owner should be more aware of that. 
[02:44:00]  They bought five more mixtures and found three more of the offending sweets.  Three News also bought some bags from the dairy.  The dairy.  Out of eight $2 and 50 cent mixtures, we found two more penis lollies.  And one cut.  Wondering if perhaps we'd overreacted, we asked Christchurch people what they thought the sweets resembled.  We've sort of come to the conclusion it has a certain penis sort of look about it.  A diddle. 
[02:44:30]  Penis.  Yeah, penis.  Jesus, look at those rules, are they?  The owner of the dairy says he had no idea the look.  They got chinks down there?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's over there.  Oh, my God.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Oh, God.  Look at his hair.  That'll save you from fucking being fired.  Where are we going?  He has the classic Moe haircut.  Oh, God.  That is the Moe Howard he is wearing.  They got chinks down there.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Oh, God.  It's okay if you say, where are we going? 
[02:45:00]  I'm sorry.  Come on.  Why was six I'm afraid of seven there, Anthony?  There you go.  Because seven, eight, nine.  Where are we going?  Oh, where are we going?  You're getting it down.  Oh, you're getting this one down.  Back to the story.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Back to the story.  Yeah, let's hear the end of this.  There's about 30 seconds left here.  The owner of the dairy says he had no idea the lollies were in the mixtures and removed  them immediately.  These lollies are nearly gone.  Right.  And did you make up the bags of lollies? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I make up the lollies.  I make up the lollies.  Okay, so you didn't notice that you did it?  Yeah, I don't know.  Sorry for that.  He says he buys his lollies from several different importers and isn't sure who sold him  the jelly genitalia.  Jelly genitalia.  I know.  What is this supposed to be?  It's lollies that are shaped like penises.  What are they supposed to look like?  I know.  They're supposed to be penises.  Yeah, I think they're supposed to be penises. 
[02:46:00]  I think they just got them wholesale.  You know, he's just making bags of it.  He doesn't know.  Oh, okay.  And it's this guy that's making them?  Yeah.  Yeah, he just puts them.  I know.  He just imports them probably from China and they're fucking just a big bag.  See that bag of candy?  It's just a big mix of all kinds of shit.  That's why the English teeth are fucking rotting out of their heads.  Those aren't English.  They're New Zealand.  Wherever the fuck they are.  Yeah, Kiwis.  Oh, that's my favorite movie ever.  Yeah, Kiwi.  New Zealand.  New Zealand.  And, you know, I'll tell you that, man. 
[02:46:30]  I think we're blowing up.  Yeah.  There's so many Where Are We Goings coming in.  Once for warriors.  Where else can you put your apprentice?  Oh, God damn.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  Why did the Mexican throw his wife off a bridge?  Why?  Tequila.  Where are we going?  Come on now.  Tequila.  Tequila.  You get it?  Tequila.  Because they speak with a little accent.  I don't like accents too much.  Where are we going?  Another one shaped like a bunghole. 
[02:47:00]  One shaped like a tit.  And another tasty one shaped like a cunt.  What was the other thing?  What did they call them?  A ding?  What did they call them?  A ding, yeah.  Something.  I like, oh, those are dirty parts.  Dirty parts.  Dirty.  Yeah.  Sometimes mommy puts her dirty parts in her mouth.  Yeah.  I know.  It's not the same thing as Australia, right?  It's a lolly full of cream filling.  Yeah.  Hi.  Good eye.  I don't know.  It's kind of similar to Australian, but a little different. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know.  I can't really do it.  We're going to Kentucky.  We got Bob the Repairman on the line.  Bob.  Hello?  Bobby.  Bob the Repairman?  Yeah.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, there's Bob the Repairman down here in Kentucky, Wade.  Yeah?  I got the Joker.  Hey, what's green?  It sits on your front porch.  Oh, no.  Look.  Why does it always have to go in this direction?  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  See?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  We're going up the unemployment line. 
[02:48:00]  Exactly.  You fucking asshole.  Why can't we just keep it clever for once?  They always have to go there.  Come on.  God.  That's like a CB radio sometimes.  Oh, is someone saying that was a gummy lighthouse?  And maybe those two balls with the rocks on the bottom?  Oh, yeah.  Like boulders.  Two big boulders and a lighthouse.  It just lost.  The light fell off and it turned into a tip.  The tip of a cock.  Turned into a helmet.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, they're sold in gummy lighthouses. 
[02:48:30]  Is that what it is?  Gummy lighthouse?  All right.  How come they were kind of curved, though?  He should have brought those to the party last night and threw them out into the crowd.  Yeah.  They would have loved it.  Woo-hoo.  Did you guys get a gummy ding?  They have plenty of real ones.  They didn't care.  Is that a gummy lighthouse?  Yeah, these are the gummy.  They do look like dicks, but they have a picture in that piece.  And it doesn't look like that.  But that does definitely look like dicks.  Yeah, but can I just say that's the original gummy lighthouse. 
[02:49:00]  And then the ones he got was from China.  Knock off.  So they're knock-off gummy dick lighthouse.  That's what happens.  But the gummy lighthouse is a sideways dick.  Yeah.  The lollies was three-dimensional.  But that looks more like a cock than the other one.  Yeah, that looks like a half-hard dick.  Yeah.  That's a dick from the side.  The other one was a dick from the top looking down.  This was a side cock feel.  Hey, which way is my best pro feel?  Yeah, that's the other one is a three-dimensional dick, which you could look at from any angle. 
[02:49:30]  Like this has one ball because you're looking at it from the side.  The other one had two balls.  Yeah, that's a drawing of a dick.  We have Cletus from Connecticut.  Cletus?  Yes.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing, Cletus?  What do you do for a living, Cletus?  I work in the fishery.  In the fishery?  Wait a minute.  You're a fisherman here now?  I work in the fishery.  I hatch the eggs.  All right.  I have a look for you.  Ready?  All right, fishery, Cletus.  What do you call a fish with no eyes?  What?  A fish.  Where are we going?  Ha ha ha. 
[02:50:00]  I got one for you, my friend.  Hey, let me tell you one now.  You know what I always say?  Working is for people who don't know how to fish.  Where are we going?  Ha ha!  All right now.  All right.  Good luck, old boy.  Good luck, old boy.  That's got the laugh going perfectly.  Bobby's really getting this character down, man.  Well, you are my acting coach.  He's an actor.  I know.  He's fucking fantastic.  Nick in Georgia.  Nick.  Hey there, guys.  What kind of bees make milk?  Little bees.  Where are we going? 
[02:50:30]  Ha ha ha.  Hey, he's got it.  You might have to copy that a little bit.  Little bees.  Where are we going?  I think you do have to emphasize the way.  That's it.  Where are we going?  Let me say hi to Jason in New York.  Jason.  Ha ha ha.  Jason.  Jason.  Hey, Jason.  What's up, man?  Jason.  Stop listening.  You're on the air.  Go ahead.  You're on the air, Jason.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, it's green.  It smells like pork. 
[02:51:00]  What?  What?  Come with the fox finger.  Where are we going?  He totally did not have it.  Nothing.  That's the prime example of how not to do it.  Danny just put up the fucking sling blade where he tells his joke.  Let me tell you something now, Yonder.  Let me tell you something now.  I believe one of the...  My wife.  My wife.  She said you wanted him to poop her.  I said I already went mudding today.  Where are we going?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I believe one of the boys was from Arkansas. 
[02:51:30]  Where are we going?  Get it?  Get it?  Where are we going?  I'll take the big ones.  Where are we going?  I believe I do see a couple of peckers in there.  Where are we going?  There are these two fellas standing on a bridge going to the bathroom.  One fella said the water's cold.  The other fella said the water's deep.  I believe one of them fellas came from Arkansas.  Get it?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I forgot the way we're going. 
[02:52:00]  I should have wrote it down, too.  Where are we going?  Now, shout out, covet applies to hunting dogs, too.  Where are we going?  Oh, come on, now.  You get it.  No, wait.  You got to hunt.  No, I got to hunt.  You got to hunt.  We got a nine-year-old ghetto youth.  Ghetto youth?  Accidentally sent a vulgar picture.  What?  He's doing a little fucking texting, and he got a little pic.  To who?  Does this explain?  I don't want to give it all away.  All right.  Where are we going?  All right.  If you have a triangle, and you put a line through the middle, will it be congruent to the other side? 
[02:52:30]  Tajee Davis is at the top of his third grade class.  I'm the most advanced in my class.  But he's not advanced enough to see the text messages being sent to his cell phone.  And I was like, what is this?  And I was like, what?  So I ran in the house.  I showed my mama.  I said, well, let me see what the text is, you know?  And I'm going like, wow.  Someone sent Tajee a picture of adults performing oral sex on a couch.  That was just too old for me. 
[02:53:00]  I wouldn't admit that.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Oh, shit.  So he got a picture of...  Wait.  He received a text?  Oh, yeah.  With a picture of the two guys blowing each other?  On a couch.  On a couch.  Where are we going?  Oh, God.  Tajee says he texted the number back, told the man he was only nine years old, but the  man texted again.  So his mother and grandmother called the number back and threatened to call the sheriff's office.  He said, do what you got to do. 
[02:53:30]  They say the man called back later, told him he was only trying to sell the couch in the  picture.  What an excuse.  Yes.  I'm just trying to sell the couch.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  That didn't work.  I'm sure it didn't work with the cops.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I'm going to prison, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I got to hear that again.  Fucking brilliant.  But maybe it's a special blowing couch.  Yes.  Mother and grandmother called the number back and threatened to call the sheriff's office.  He said, do what you got to do. 
[02:54:00]  They say the man called back later, told him he was only trying to sell the couch in the  picture.  It's puzzling and it belittles me to see, you know, that you can sit there and this is  the only picture that you can find to send somebody advertising a couch.  Advertising.  Now, he was desperate for a sale if he was going to do that.  The family says they gave Taji a cell phone so he and his sister could check in with the  family before and after school.  It's a security blanket.  Now they feel their security has been breached and they're not sure what to do.  Do you keep the phone or do you take the phone?  The Lee County Sheriff's Office is investigating and Taji's grandmother wants justice. 
[02:54:30]  People make a mistake and I don't feel like it was a mistake.  Wow, is that great?  Wow, man.  Just take fucking grace.  To sell the couch.  Oh, what a great excuse.  Maybe you can take a picture of it when two men aren't blowing each other on it.  One of the greatest pictures ever.  Thank you.  Oh, the teapot.  I haven't seen this in a while.  The teapot.  The eBay teapot.  You ever see this one?  Uh, teapot.  Yeah, that's the, he's selling a teapot.  You think this is real?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's real.  It looks good.  The reflection in it, because it's chrome, is a completely naked fat man taking a picture 
[02:55:00]  of his teapot and his reflection is in there so you see him all naked.  Well, listen, we got to sell some junk for Valentine's Day so we got to take a break.  You sure?  Maybe it's the Borgata.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Might be.  One million shot.  Yeah.  Oh, come on now.  We're going to, we're going to take a quick, quick break.  Oh, cool.  We'll take a quick break, but before we go, I just want to ask you one question now.  Yes, Billy the Bass Man. 
[02:55:30]  What do you call fat bra with breast cancer?  Jesus, Bobby.  Voluptuous.  Where we going?  Now, let's take a break on that one.  Voluptuous?  Voluptuous.  Oh, God damn it.  There's a lump in her dick, and she's fat.  Where we going?  Where we going?  Where we going?  Jesus.  Oh, gee.  That is terrible.  It's sensitivity training, hopefully.  You fucking ogre.  Come on.  We're all going to the same place.  Where we going?  Quick break.  And then I think we got David Tell on the other side to help, not even help. 
[02:56:00]  They don't need help to promote the fact that the anti-social tour is going to be up there  in wherever Foxwood's, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, David Tell will have all the info.  This show is going to sell out.  So we'll just say hi to Dave.  Bob Kelly in studio playing Albany tonight.  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  Saturday night.  Tomorrow night.  Bob Kelly.  Palace Theater.  Albany.  Fucking, I highly recommend you go see Bobby.  Fucking hilarious.  Yes.  The virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM. 
[02:56:30]  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, we got you right to the phone.  It's David Tell on the line.  Dave.  We don't want him waiting around.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, guys.  Thanks for having me.  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you, sir?  I'm excited for Valentine's Day.  I'm getting my mom a slam chop.  The slam chop.  That's great.  Yeah, you see what that could do?  Great.  And the sham wow.  He said it's like a vibrator for old people. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, fucking Dave.  We got Bob Kelly.  Bobby Kelly.  What's up, Dave?  Oh, hey, Bobby.  What's up, man?  What's happening, brother?  Gotta love the Bob Kelly.  He's retooling his act, Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, he's doing something called Billy the Bassman.  And he talks in a southern accent and tells jokes and then says,  Yeah, where are we going?  He's got a catchphrase and everything.  He's got a catchphrase.  Where are we going?  Yeah.  We decide Bobby needed a catchphrase to change his name.  And Middle America will love him. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Dave, let me ask you a question.  Here it is.  I'm going to change my...  I'm going to get a catchphrase.  I'm going to go, I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing.  That's all you need, and you are in.  You're in Middle America.  Catchphrases.  You know, Bobby is like one of the roughest, edgiest acts I've ever seen.  He's super filthy and really, really funny.  Yeah.  But we've got to get more family humor out there.  We really do.  That's really what has to happen. 
[02:58:00]  And thank God for you guys with the tour that you guys are doing.  Yes.  And what is it?  The Anti-Social Network Tour at Foxwoods.  Tickets go on sale in minutes.  And this thing's going to sell out.  I don't even know why Dave's calling.  We love when he's on the show, but you don't have to promote this, Dave.  I know.  This is silly.  We should just talk about other stuff.  I have to.  It's going to run to like a Chinese sneaker factory.  It's a great tour, and, you know, you guys were down there in Jersey when we played Atlantic City. 
[02:58:30]  It's family-friendly, which is good.  It was family-friendly.  And the name of the tour is so long, even an obese man cannot wear it on a T-shirt.  It's not.  It's got to definitely shorten it up.  That is a long name for a tour.  The Anti-Social Network with Dave Attell, Bill Burr, Jim Brewer, and, of course, Jim Norton.  And it's at Foxwoods, right?  Yes.  Bad news, though.  The Cairo date has been canceled.  Ah, there's a lot. 
[02:59:00]  There's a lot.  I didn't do nothing.  Their slogans are so fucking stupid, too.  Through the interpreter, it's like, and they're chanting.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  No, they're chanting, leave, leave.  We need to be free people here with our flag to be you leave.  It's like, what the?  That doesn't even make sense.  Let me get a better translator.  Yeah, get a fucking.  You can Twitter, those people.  You need something like, we're here, we're queer, we're fabulous, get used to us, we're here. 
[02:59:30]  Something that could, you know, roll off the tongue like a cock.  Like you were singing last night.  Yes, exactly.  I will.  Yeah.  Jim Norton can't fly in until they get a good phrase, a good way to promote themselves.  Yeah, then he'll fly in and give his fucking two cents.  I love when Spicoli, because he'll always be Spicoli, flies into Haiti or Louisiana or  something and has to give his fucking two cents about how someone else is to blame for what's 
[03:00:00]  going on.  Shut up.  Did you see, like, in the beginning of the revolt, like, when the cops were, like, they're  out on the street shooting, I guess that was, like, hot wax on the people.  They were threatening to shave the entire population.  That'll scare them.  I love it, because, you know, it's great, because they're, like, throwing down with our  reporters.  It's really cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, Anderson Cooper took a few blows to the head, huh?  It's that tap out. 
[03:00:30]  It's, uh, the first, I liked the first episode of this show, but it's starting to get boring.  They're going to have to really pick it up by the finale.  I mean, either someone better get Jersey or pregnant, or I'm punching out of this one.  Yeah, really.  The beauty of it is, it really does show you the power of, uh, of, uh, whatchamacallit,  of Twitter.  Yeah.  These people, they don't believe in, um, you know, uh, whatever, but they do believe in, 
[03:01:00]  uh, technology, and I think that's good, and that it's a great start.  You know, they don't believe in, uh, letting a woman vote or whatever, but, you know, get  her on Facebook, and they're cool with that, so.  No, it's, it's good.  They had one of those, uh, what do they call those killings when they kill a woman for doing  something, um, against the family?  I didn't do nothing.  Uh, I think it's an honor killing.  Yeah, an honor killing.  They do that, but, uh, nowadays, uh, they hit them with iPhones in the face.  They bury them up to their neck.  And technology, nothing? 
[03:01:30]  No.  Uh, sorry.  Where are we going?  Boo, where are we going?  Hey, where are we going?  I just gotta say, where are we going?  It works.  I guess this would happen with the new Verizon iPhone.  I knew this would happen.  Yes.  Well, the lines for that phone yesterday.  Whew.  The tens of people.  Oh, really?  Wow, tens of, exactly, people.  Well, they have that new one coming out in, in the summer, so why the fuck are you gonna  go buy the four when the five is coming out?  Yeah, no one was online yesterday.  It was an easy purchase.  I would like to change service from AT&T to a Verizon, but I'm not gonna buy a phone that I have 
[03:02:00]  now when the new one comes out in July.  So, fuck it.  Where are we going?  Who are you gonna yell at if you don't have AT&T, though?  Uh...  I can't do it again until I hear about it.  I'm yelling on it in a movie.  So, I really don't know.  Is that how you choose your phones?  That is a cool one.  What is that that you're screaming at your baby daddy at?  I didn't do nothing.  Where are we going?  I love the catchphrase.  It's so stupid.  Well, lame.  It's such a good tour that, you know, we're gonna hit Foxwood, which is gonna be a great 
[03:02:30]  thing, especially, I don't know what the weather's gonna be like, so I assume we're  gonna be painting blankets.  Yeah.  But, uh, it's gonna be a great, uh, a great show.  It's, uh, Norton, of course, and then, uh, Brewer and Bill Burr and then myself.  And, uh, we'd love to, I'd love to get Bobby on it, you know?  That would be good.  I'd love to be on it, yeah.  There's a room for a Bobby?  We better talk to Jimmy.  There's room for a Bobby.  It'd be great to get people, like, special guests, like, just to drop by. 
[03:03:00]  Like, oh, look who it is.  Who closes that show?  Who closes the show, Dave?  I do.  Oh, my God.  Dave fucking...  No, Dave, you fucking killed it in Atlantic City.  I fucking loved it.  That's the word that's coming in right now.  I fucking loved it.  Dave's the funniest.  Are you using the F-bomb?  Yeah, I fucking sure did.  Yeah, you can say fuck.  Satellite radio.  Satellite.  That's right, I forgot.  Doesn't offend anybody.  She sold two tickets.  I'm sorry, living under Mubarak for so long, I forgot. 
[03:03:30]  What do you guys think he's gonna do?  I mean, like, what is he gonna be now?  Like, just, uh, a vampire?  I hear he left Cairo and went to some summer, like, resort that he has.  Yeah.  Uh, because, uh, I'm thinking maybe a Mussolini might happen if you give these people any more  time.  Nah, they can't find him now.  It's over, man.  But there's no second, there's no guy ready to step up.  That's the, they forgot to think that over.  Yeah, they need the guy that's supposed to step in.  They need the Fidel Castro.  They need somebody that's gonna be the revolutionary. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, it looks all, it looks great on TV, but they don't have a guy.  I mean, I do like the Muslim Brotherhood.  Right.  I think that would be nice if they stepped up.  I love when they tour.  I hope we don't go against them.  Yeah, the Muslim Brotherhood tour.  They're hysterical.  Didn't they, didn't they do the halftime at the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  Yeah, they, they cut off, uh, people's hands.  It's wonderful.  Their catchphrase.  Who are we blowing up?  Ha ha ha.  Wow.  Ha ha ha ha.  Where are we going?  Ha ha ha.  There you go.  That's all you need.  The new bar should, like, take over Tunisia. 
[03:04:30]  They should just do, like, a rotate, like a, like a soccer or something, like, you know,  like volleyball.  Like, he should run Tunisia for a while.  Oh, he could just, oh, like, rotate the, uh, dictators.  Yeah, I like that.  Yeah, like musical countries.  Kind of like what LeBron James did.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Take his, yeah.  Take his shit somewhere else.  I think it's a good idea.  Yeah, but I'm for, I'm totally for these Egyptian people.  They're doing great.  Yeah, you like that?  They're, uh, watch my clothes.  I like how, like, when, uh, the police left and they started arming themselves with, um, 
[03:05:00]  with the clubs and the, um, and that curvy knife.  The curvy knife.  Yeah, that big curvy knife.  The Hassan chop knife.  They pulled out their, uh, what else did they do there?  I don't know.  They're very, uh...  Well, the bread helmet.  Did you see the bread helmet guy?  The bread helmet is classic.  The guy put bread...  He actually took saran wrap and wrapped bread on his head to protect himself from the rocks.  So he, he, in essence, was wearing bread armor, which I don't think I've ever seen.  I watch the History Channel a lot. 
[03:05:30]  I've never seen armor made of bread before.  But, uh, really, he had a big...  He had, like, one of those things on his head that they hollow out and put soup in.  And, and, like, uh, you know, at some of the classier joints.  Hummus?  Yeah, yeah.  They use the hummus so it sticks on the head, like, like polydent.  I think it's great for the Middle East and them finally to get, uh, the freedom that they deserve.  And we have to immediately start building nuclear power plants in this country right now.  I think that would be nice.  Yeah, start building some, uh... 
[03:06:00]  It would be more charming if we had, like, our own power.  Like, if we didn't need them for oil, it would be very, very charming.  Like, oh, look at them.  This is like, uh, whatever.  A reenactment.  That is good.  So, like, we're wondering, like, you know, will I be able to drive tomorrow?  I don't know.  What's going on here?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Apparently nowhere.  The square is packed.  It's going nowhere like my bed.  Anyway, that's why I'm closing, Bobby.  Ah, no, stop you.  Fucking tables.  The jury show was really different because, uh, that was the meeting of all of our crowds. 
[03:06:30]  It was like in the movie Warriors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you dig it?  All the gangs got there.  And, uh, Norton was like the, uh, Elias.  Who was that guy?  The black, uh, like, uh, guy who got them all together.  Oh, Cyrus?  Cyrus.  Cyrus.  Cyrus, yeah.  He was like the Sharpton.  I was the dyke gang.  I was the dyke gang.  Were you at the Lizzies?  The Lizzies.  The Lizzies.  And, uh, yeah.  It's weird to fill out without a huge, uh, gay or lesbian fan base. 
[03:07:00]  Am I right?  That's very difficult.  Usually you do need gay or lesbo.  They really do, like, help fill a room.  Oh, Indian.  You need Indian.  Indian.  Indian is a new thing to need.  Yeah.  They're all on the street.  They've all taken to the streets.  Yeah.  That's actually not, that's a Russell, Russell Peters show that you're actually seeing on.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Draws just as well, doesn't he?  Yeah, fucking A.  Russell Peters.  We just fly in there, pull out the pyramids and that sphinx and that one cool guy who runs 
[03:07:30]  the camel ride and then just watch the door behind.  Exactly.  You need to get the two crocodiles that they have there that people get pictures with when  they go over there and get the fuck out.  They ride.  I love watching the people.  Everybody that's been to Egypt has that picture of them by the pyramids on a camel.  And you're just like, oh, you went to Egypt?  Like they were Indiana Jones actually in the crypts doing things.  No, they hop on a camel, take a picture and they're fucking out.  I have the same photo I got in Vegas at the Sahara Hotel. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, you're not fucking, you're not doing anything there.  Finding the Ark of the Covenant.  Doing shit.  Petra.  You know, I'm worried about Israel, of course, all the time.  Well, who wouldn't be?  It's right there.  I know.  I can't see why they're not chewing it up right now and, you know, attacking.  Chewing it up.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going from Moses' tricks and pointing that Red Sea and getting over there?  Yeah, you know, last time Moses was able to take care of business over there in Egypt. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Told Pharaoh to go fuck himself.  We're hitting the road.  I don't want people to think this is going to be a religious show in Fox.  It's not.  Yeah, it really isn't.  Some people coming down with their ailments, you know, like, what do you think?  We can make them walk.  I don't want to do that.  Touch his head.  At home.  Make them walk.  Anthony, you were playing some hardcore blackjack in Atlantic City.  Yeah.  That was, wow.  I took a beating, though. 
[03:09:00]  I took a real beating.  It was awful.  You were playing blackjack and then there's, like, another younger guy, like, just watching  you play.  Like, was that part of the dream?  Yeah, that's actually part of the dream, is just having people around the table to go  like, yeah.  You know.  I don't care about their money.  Be a high roller.  That's it.  I love that.  I love that at a blackjack table.  It's always, like, a guy with no money cheering on the guy who's, like, who's got balls, you  know?  I was risking it all.  The guy driving you to a tranny gangbang. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, get in there.  That's exactly it.  That's how I felt, too.  My ass was raw like a tranny gangbang, leaving that fucking table.  That guy was a mush.  I had my ups and I had my downs, but it ended with downs, so.  Much like our audience, it ended with downs.  You guys know the dealer's name?  That's the best part.  Yes.  Scumbag.  Asshole.  Fuck you.  I know all the dealers. 
[03:10:00]  I always get the bitterest Asian as the dealer.  Yeah, I rarely sit at a table when an Asian is first up there, because they're just machines.  There's no sense of humor.  You don't get any fun.  I like the old guy that's just been weathered.  Remembers Vegas when it was fucking, when the mob ran it.  Got great stories of fucking knocking people out and just leaving them out back.  That's the dealer you want.  You don't want some Asian woman that doesn't speak any English.  She deals faster than you.  You can't even see her hand move.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Grabs your chips. 
[03:10:30]  No smile.  Fuck you.  You know, if you fuck up at a casino and get thrown out, it takes like an hour and a half  to get you out of that casino.  They are so big, and nobody knows where the exits are.  They really are giant.  You can place bets as they're throwing you out.  You're throwing money down on the roulette.  You're shooting craps.  They're fucking hauling your ass out of there.  You can actually do a whole one-man show of bitterness.  I usually do that going back to my room. 
[03:11:00]  I'm spitting on the floor.  He spits on the floor at the casino.  That was weird.  Bad times, huh?  Yeah.  It was a bad one, Dave.  Yeah, I usually do very well.  I've been on a lucky streak for a good year and a half.  No shit.  Like, I don't go a lot.  But the thing is, I don't go a lot.  I only go when there's like one of these, you know, like there's an event going on.  Then I go to the casinos.  Because I rarely go like, oh, I'm taking a, I'm going down this weekend at the Borgata or something.  I usually, you know, it's once maybe every three months, six months, shit like that. 
[03:11:30]  That's not bad.  Yeah.  And I've had a really good string of luck.  But this last time was just, oof, brutal.  You know, I don't even gamble with money anymore.  I use all my unsold merch.  You just throw that out there.  Let it ride an old DVD.  It is.  Season one of Insomniac.  Yeah.  Double down.  A refrigerator magnet. 
[03:12:00]  Hey, shit, man.  Fucking it.  Hey, Dave, we got to get the fuck out of here to tell you the truth.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Bobby, thanks for letting me join in, man.
