<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion centered on the fallout from Michael Richards' racist rant at the Laugh Factory. Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and later Joe Rogan, debated CBS Radio's refusal to play a popular online remix of the rant which included the N-word. They argued this demonstrated a disconnect between the station's policies and listener preferences, citing the increased sales of *Seinfeld* season seven following the incident as proof that controversy sells.  The hosts also discussed Mel Gibson's comment on the Richards situation and a listener-submitted video remix of Seinfeld clips featuring the incident.  This segment included a comparison of penis sizes amongst the hosts and Rich Voss, Opie's mass iPod purchase, and a shocking news story about a high school principal with a foot fetish and a Hitler mustache who kissed the feet of three 14-year-old boys.  The upcoming eggnog drinking contest featuring Pat, a diabetic with nine toes, and technical difficulties with their audio equipment were also mentioned.  Joe Rogan contributed to the discussion, sharing anecdotes about his comedic videos featuring pranks on day laborers that led to his being banned from a tour. The segment concluded with discussion of Danny DeVito's intoxicated appearance on *The View* and Mel Gibson's upcoming film, *Apocalypto*.

The show continued with further discussion about Michael Richards’ tirade, exploring possible contributing factors like substance abuse and the presence of a female companion.  This segued into a broader conversation about the use of racial slurs in comedy clubs,  including a club owner's policy of fining comedians for using the N-word and the ensuing backlash.  Lisa Lampanelli's potentially offensive onstage language was also mentioned.  A substantial portion of this segment focused on Danny DeVito’s rambling, intoxicated interview on *The View*, with audio clips being played and analyzed.  The hosts and guests, including Joe Rogan and Ari Shafir ("the amazing racist"),  discussed the acceptable boundaries of on-air language and the frequent self-censorship they practiced.  Brent was also a guest during this part of the show.  The band Jet performed live during this segment.  Rich Voss remained in the studio throughout much of this portion.  The discussions were punctuated with numerous jokes, vulgar humor, playful ribbing, and arguments between the hosts and guests.

The broadcast then shifted gears, beginning with a discussion about the perceived ease with which male musicians attract women, followed by an anecdote about a girl hitting on tattooed rock musicians on a plane.  This led to a discussion about a boy with cancer auctioning ad space on his head on eBay to raise money for leukemia research. The hosts’ reactions ranged from sarcastic to concerned.  This was followed by a news story about a New Orleans family who sold their post-Hurricane Katrina free house for profit, with the hosts playing audio clips highlighting the husband's repeated claim, "Take it up with God."  A listener called in to suggest advertising on the cancer patient's head.  The hosts also discussed Snoop Dogg's multiple arrests, Suge Knight's reaction, and an incident on their PalTalk show involving a woman with a gun and clippers.  The segment included a live, impromptu performance by the band Octane from Philadelphia during the show's "walkover," interspersed with conversations with people on the street, including a newsstand owner whose relative had recently passed away.

The final segment heavily featured a discussion about marijuana, focusing on different strains, their effects, and potency.  Anecdotes about getting extremely high were shared, including one about a Fear Factor experience.  The hosts and Joe Rogan (who was a guest throughout this segment) discussed the history and legality of marijuana, comparing it to alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs.  Rogan also talked about his comedy career and upcoming shows at Carolines.  The conversation also touched upon comedians Brian Regan and Bill Burr (including a discussion of a popular Bill Burr YouTube video) and Jim Norton getting pulled over by a police officer.  The hosts mentioned their upcoming commercial shoot and plans for a future tour.  The Amazing Racist and Octane were also mentioned as being present and scheduled to perform later in the show. The segment concluded with more crude and offensive banter between the hosts and Rogan.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  One thousand millions come out. Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage. 
[00:00:30]  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  O.P.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore. 
[00:01:00]  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  And...  I hate you. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Palaver.  Palaver.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Greetings.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Headphones sound very Basie today.  That's good.  Every day it's a little different.  You could count on that.  Count Basie. 
[00:02:00]  I don't know if I didn't hear it.  Pat from the Naki joke.  He'll be part of the eggnog drinking contest tomorrow.  Can't wait.  So psyched.  Third annual.  Third annual.  The day tomorrow.  Yes.  Pat's a diabetic and he has nine toes.  He lost the tenth one due to diabetes.  Yeah.  Yet he has been in all of our eggnog drinking competitions.  Not much sugar in eggnog, right?  Nah.  Nah, I don't think so.  Not much things that could really harm a diabetic in there, right?  Nah.  We want his feet to look like pig knuckles by the time we're finished with him. 
[00:02:30]  He's the current world record holder as well as far as the eggnog drinking contest goes.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We got a real busy show today.  This is really distracting with the freaking headphones.  Ah.  Why does it have to be different every day?  You know what happens though?  In three minutes, four minutes, you don't even notice.  That's what I'm hoping.  It sounds normal.  And then if they went back to normal tomorrow, you'd be like, what happened? 
[00:03:00]  I guess you're right.  Hey, we got Rich Voss stopping in today.  Thank the Lord.  We got Joe Rogan stopping in today.  Of course, from Fear Factor.  Yeah.  Ultimate Fighting and all that.  And just ass kicking.  Yeah.  He's just a scary dude, but a real good friend of the show.  He usually brings like a squad of killers with him.  Yeah.  Maybe he will.  Maybe he won't.  I don't know.  That's it.  He's also a good solo, you know?  Mm-hmm.  He could kick a little ass all by himself.  He's got that scary posse that he usually brings with him. 
[00:03:30]  Posse.  And then we got Jet, and it's set up nice today.  So we're going to try this music thing again on the Opie and Anthony show.  Did they actually sound check everything?  They've been working on this since last night.  Well, then I see no problem.  I'm going to assure everyone it's going to go off without a hitch today.  I hope.  Because Army of Anyone was just a complete disaster.  Very, very depressing for everybody.  They were great.  The sound and equipment.  Yee.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Yee.  But Jet will be performing at least a song or two for us today.  We can't wait for that.  All right?  Right.  And there it is.  I'm on break.com.  We were just discussing this before the show that, you know, regular radio, free radio,  which we are part of, is really, really out of touch.  Out of touch.  And we're working with, like, Joel Hollander here at CBS Radio and other people.  We're trying to show them the way.  We're trying to wake them up before it's too late.  We're trying to do them a favor. 
[00:04:30]  Bring them back.  Take them out of those boardrooms and corporate mindset.  And all that stuff.  And get back to the basics that this is all about.  Entertaining people.  They've got to wake up.  We have XM Satellite Radio.  So, you know, we go over there and we do everything.  And whatever we want.  Whatever we want.  And that's how it should be for the most part.  And the people that are listening to our show right now on these free radio stations are also the same people that have MySpace accounts, that love going to YouTube, that love going to break.com, and many, many other sites. 
[00:05:00]  Okay?  Yep.  We have this rap song, this Kramer rap remix.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a bit on the dirty side because you hear the N-word because it's Michael Richards saying the N-word.  And they took his tirade from the Laugh Factory and cut it up into a rap song. 
[00:05:30]  And someone did a really good job on it.  It sounds like a really good rap song.  And it's funny.  And it's funny is right.  It's a great parody of the situation.  It's not insightful.  It's not hateful.  It's taking what Michael Richards did and making humor out of it.  It's funny.  And it's extremely topical because this is one of these stories that has legs, as they say. 
[00:06:00]  And it's catchy.  And it's still just going every day.  There's more angles to the story every single day.  Yes, it's catchy.  Exactly.  It's not some dope that just decides, I get a chance to say the N-word a lot.  Watch what I could do.  It's well, well done.  We've been trying to play this stupid thing on this show for three days now.  We play it on XM every afternoon.  Why am I saying afternoon?  Every day after we leave here because it feels like afternoon by the time we go over to XM, I guess.  So we play it over there.  We can't play it over here. 
[00:06:30]  And I say to the CBS bosses, wake the F up.  Yep.  You're going to get passed by.  Wake up and understand what the listeners of your radio stations are doing in their spare time when they're not listening to your radio stations.  They want you to entertain a certain demographic.  That's what radio is all about.  And the demographic that we are supposed to be entertaining is very savvy with this stuff.  They go online.  They find stuff. 
[00:07:00]  And this would be really funny to play.  Yeah, we've thrown it up on opiananthony.com.  And I just got really annoyed because I do check out break.com and YouTube pretty much every day, just like our listeners do.  And I go to break.com this morning, and there it is on the front page.  Break.com adds like three videos a day.  You know, they control it a little more than YouTube as far as videos go.  It's right there on the front page.  It's only been up there an hour or two.  It already has a quarter million views. 
[00:07:30]  A quarter million views.  Why would we play that here, you know, where people would want to hear it?  Why do that?  It's why they got to wake up.  There can't be this zero tolerance policy.  There's nothing worse than the zero tolerance policy.  It's like if you blurt out the N-word with hate or inciting, I can understand that.  There's a problem there.  But it doesn't mean it can never be used in any way, shape, or form, especially when it's used on hip-hop stations with songs and other comedy acts depending on what race you are and things like that. 
[00:08:00]  This has nothing really to do with that.  Of course not.  It's just taking a news story that is huge, on the front page is everything, and putting it to song in a very funny way.  Yeah.  But they don't get it.  And maybe some people will be offended.  Oh, well, that's what creates talk.  That's what creates talk. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  That's what creates some of those water cooler moments.  Right.  Because know what happens?  Big bosses of CBS radio, they hear the Kramer rap on our show.  So guess what?  Oh, my God.  Did you listen to Opie and Anthony this morning?  Did you hear that Kramer rap thing?  Oh, you haven't?  Well, and then they start discussing the show.  Yeah.  The show.  Is one dumb Kramer rap thing going to make or break the Opie and Anthony show?  No. 
[00:09:00]  No, it's not.  Of course not.  But these people have got to wake up.  Yeah.  You know, we've been arguing that we should be able to use the, you know, the N-word if  it's in a news story.  How do we, as a talk show, discuss the Michael Richards thing, but we can't say the actual  word?  Or play the audio?  No, can't even play the audio.  That is so stupid.  Which has been played everywhere.  The lawyers.  We've all heard it.  It's stupid lawyers.  Lawyers ruin everything, by the way.  Look, in the end.  They really do.  In the end, we got XM. 
[00:09:30]  So, you know, we'll be okay in the end.  But I'm doing CBS a favor today.  We're doing CBS a favor today.  And telling them to wake the F up.  Yeah.  And understand where your listeners are when they're not listening to radio shows like  ours.  They're on break.com.  They're on YouTube.  Go there yourselves and see what they're watching and listening to.  People supposedly in charge.  in charge of the creative end of this whole thing have to just get out of the boardrooms 
[00:10:00]  and meetings with lawyers and everything else and really get down to street level, if  I might say, street level.  And it's not an FCC violation, by the way.  No, it's not.  No.  No, it's absolutely not.  No.  And maybe you might think it's just one lousy bit.  But no, this is the way it's going.  Yeah.  So I want to at least, you know, jump on my little soapbox.  Try to give them a little wake-up call.  And wake people up, because this is where it's all going. 
[00:10:30]  People go to break.com every morning.  They go to YouTube.  They check out MySpace pages.  And it's a lot different.  They're getting away with a lot more stuff on those sites and other sites.  It's making radio more irrelevant.  Right.  You know, they have to embrace that.  And understand, we're not going to get on the air and blurt out those seven dirty words  or, you know, talk graphically about sex in a way that's, you know, pandering and goes 
[00:11:00]  on and on.  And, you know, we're not talking about that stuff.  We're not talking about losing a station's license because of FCC complaints.  This has nothing to do with the FCC.  I don't understand where this rule came from.  What's the background of this ruling?  Who made it?  And why?  That's what I'd love to hear.  I'd love to sit down with those dopey lawyers and find out who made that decision and why.  They're afraid of upsetting blacks.  They're afraid of upsetting a special interest group. 
[00:11:30]  It's a bunch of dopey, older white guys that are completely out of touch.  They're a bunch of frightened white guys who are terrified.  They just want to retire quietly.  They don't want any problems.  They have no hunger for their creativity.  And they wonder why it's getting its teeth kicked in by every other medium.  Well, let's look at something then.  Let's look at what happens when you anger a certain group.  And let's choose, because it's in the news with Kramer and everything, black people.  You anger them with his tirade. 
[00:12:00]  You call for a boycott of season seven of the Seinfeld DVD, which has just been released.  Right.  I guess sales have just plummeted.  And Jerry is actually out on street corners with duffel bags trying to sell his own DVD  because they can't get rid of him now because of this boycott.  Isn't that what happened?  This is what controversy does.  This is what edgy material does.  Okay.  It's in the paper today. 
[00:12:30]  Seinfeld soars on racist rant.  The KK Kramer scandal murdered Michael Richards' career, but it's doing wonders for sales of  the latest Seinfeld DVD.  Season seven, the one they want everyone to just boycott, right?  Seinfeld is outselling season six, which was released on the same day last year, by more than 75%.  75%.  Everybody wants to pick up Seinfeld season seven and now watch Seinfeld and go, oh, wow, look at Kramer here. 
[00:13:00]  Look at Kramer here.  They're killing.  And this situation could be, in recent history, in recent news, one of the most offensive things to hit the black community by somebody.  And look at what it did.  Look at what their calls of anger for apologies, all the publicity that he got, and a boycott.  Look at what all those calls did for the bottom line, which was the product, the entertainment product that they were trying to get rid of, that they were angered with. 
[00:13:30]  Sales 75% more than last year.  And more than 90% over season five, by the way.  Don't you understand?  By the way.  There you got Jason Alexander gearing up to attack the Jews next year.  There you have it.  Controversy sells.  Edgy radio sells.  Edgy radio gets people listening and talking around the water cooler. 
[00:14:00]  Not talking about FCC here.  So when you tell us you can't play that edgy Kramer remix rap thing, you're just hurting yourselves in the end.  And we got another gig, man.  In the end, we got another gig.  We're trying to help you out here.  You know, if this doesn't work out for us, then we go back to XM and we're still radio stars.  And what are you left with?  You got to wake up.  Because these same people are in the boardroom going, oh, listenership at all.  Our stations are down.  I don't understand what's going on here. 
[00:14:30]  You've cut back too far because you're scared of nothing.  None of them have any problems.  You're scared of your own shadows.  Like I said, totally understandable.  FCC, you got to watch out.  You could lose a license.  You could get huge fines.  Understand.  We get it.  We get the FCC portion of this thing.  Don't worry about it.  But when you enact these other rules because you're scared, you're running scared, crapless,  it's time to really reassess and look at these policies that are in place and see that it is really destroying radio. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Listenership is down with all the music stations.  Know why?  People have iPods.  Know why people have iPods?  You've been using the same effing playbook for 40 years.  Yeah.  You've got to update the playbook.  Get out of those offices.  Get out of your cubicles.  Get out of the frigging boardrooms and out of the meetings with your lawyers.  And look at what this is supposed to be all about.  Entertaining people, making some noise, having fun, a little controversy. 
[00:15:30]  That's it.  So there you go.  Seinfeld, season seven, selling 75% more than season six.  Good boycott, people.  Selling like picket-testants.  I think the only explanation that could be is that it's theirs.  What is that?  That doesn't make sense.  I think the only explanation that could be is that it's theirs, a Kramer curiosity factor. 
[00:16:00]  I guess that's a –  Is that theirs a – I should have wrote.  Is that theirs a Kramer – yeah.  All right.  I can understand that after what happened, there's a resurgent interest in Seinfeld,  and that seems to be expressing itself through people watching the show more and buying more DVDs.  I even watch Seinfeld more.  It's on TV.  Yeah.  It's just – I don't know why, but there's a – you look at it a whole different way now.  And speaking of which, speaking of which, because we're on break.com every day and YouTube,  and actually Anthony brought this one to my attention.  I think it was on what, Drudge?  Mm-hmm.  Where did you find it first, the lost episode? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, on – actually on Wackbag.  Oh, Wackbag or on Wackbag?  Yeah.  One of our fan sites?  Yeah.  And then – but it was up on – I'm not even sure where.  Another one of these, you know, video sites.  Yeah.  Someone put together a great little remix thing of video.  Put it together of Seinfeld episodes and the controversy, and it's hysterical.  Really funny.  Yeah, they take the video of Michael Richards at the Laugh Factory and, yeah, splice it into –  Put it into Seinfeld episodes. 
[00:17:00]  It's unbelievable.  They're really funny.  And to the bigwigs here at CBS Radio, you might want to go to break.com.  That will be on the front page tomorrow, if not later today.  Yeah.  We already have it up on opianthony.com, by the way.  You really should check it out.  It's called the Seinfeld Lost Episode, and it's great.  Could we explain something to the idiot on line three?  Could we please explain something?  David from Dallas.  Hi. 
[00:17:30]  Good morning.  Why don't you just throw out what you want to say?  Why don't y'all just play it?  Why don't we have the balls, it says, to just play it?  Yeah, just play it.  Just play it.  Why can't we just play it?  Y'all got another gig, right?  What?  Y'all got another gig, right?  Do you know what would happen if...  Let's play it.  Hold on.  Let me explain to you for a minute.  Do you know what would happen if we played it?  I have no idea.  Yeah, obviously you have no idea.  So instead of just calling up and calling us pretty much pussies for not playing it, 
[00:18:00]  let me explain to you what happens.  We would play it.  There's a guy down the hall that has a button, and he would chop it to pieces.  You would never hear it.  Why play it if no one's going to hear it?  Because they would dump out of every time the N-word is used.  And it's used so many times that they would, what is called, run out of dump and have to  remove our show from the air for a short time, which is what they do.  And knowing this station, it would probably go into commercial. 
[00:18:30]  So all you would hear is, all you would hear as a listener is, all right, we're going to  play it.  We're going to have the balls to play it.  Here it is.  The KK Kramer rap.  Boom.  We'll hit the button.  You'll hear a commercial.  Yeah.  All right.  That's how it would work.  You wouldn't hear it.  It has nothing about having any courage or...  It wouldn't go over the air, dude.  Yeah, you'd never hear it.  So what we would...  Believe me, we were talking about just playing it, but no one would ever hear it.  So what we tell people today is, go to opianthony.com, and you could also go to break.com, because 
[00:19:00]  there's a video version of it.  All right.  In fairness to the quality, I said to Opie, they're like, just, let's just play it.  But it's like, why?  It would be stupid.  You'd never hear it.  Nobody would hear a word of it.  No one would hear it.  It's not like the dump guy would trip and crack his head open, and we could just play  it and get away with it.  All the joy that would be.  Ow.  Go to hell.  Ow.  Ow.  You're going to jump out of it, ow.  Ow.  Okay, ow.  Kyle just wants to get through the day and get home to whatever smooth little Asian fellow. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  All right.  We're just getting started.  So there's the latest on...  Well, almost the latest on Kramer.  We have a Mel Gibson item today.  Oh, Mel Gibson.  Didn't we say this yesterday?  We said it yesterday that celebrities are coming out of the woodwork to jump on the Kramer thing  to get their own kind of publicity.  But I'm sure in Mel Gibson's case, you know, everyone was searching him out because it's  kind of similar to what he did. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And he's got a new movie coming out, so...  And finally, he's commenting.  I guess we could give you that comment after the break here.  Yeah.  You know, Monique was yesterday.  You know, and most people, when we played that audio yesterday, were like, Monique, who  the hell's she?  That's the point we were trying to make, by the way.  Exactly.  They're all coming out of the woodwork, doesn't matter how big or small.  Yeah, especially celebrities that, you know, are looking for a little pop, a little publicity.  You know, they see this as an opportunity to get their names in print and on TV. 
[00:20:30]  You know, you're not going to get, like, Tom Cruise commenting about what Kramer did  at the Laugh Factory, but you will get celebrities like Monique doing it.  And that was our point yesterday, by the way.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show is headed to Florida, and you're not.  Tune in to the Opie and Anthony Show Monday and Tuesday morning, December 4th and 5th,  as we broadcast from the Buzz 103 FM studios in West Palm, without you. 
[00:21:00]  If you're in the West Palm area, feel free to stop by and watch the show from a safe distance.  That's Monday and Tuesday morning, December 4th and 5th, live from West Palm.  Details on OpieandAnthony.com.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  Opie and Anthony, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  Trust me on that.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  There's one way to find out.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We got Jim Norton, of course.  We got Jet coming in today.  We got Joe Rogan coming in today.  We got the Eggnog Drinking Contest tomorrow.  We got Rich Voss in studio right now.  And Eric is being fired.  Yeah, hopefully.  Hopefully he'll get his pink slip today and we can be done with him.  We're doing a little man-to-man size comparing, chit-chat off the air.  That's what we do. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I have no doubt that Anthony has the biggest one in studio.  And I think Jimmy and I are about equal because I've seen Jimmy so many times that it was easy to kind of compare.  And we've seen cute little pictures of Rich Voss's and you're just so out of the mix, it's not even funny.  Shut up, tall child.  Here's the thing is, it doesn't matter because sometimes I finish so quick, it doesn't matter what size it is.  One time I was with a girl, this is no lie, she was so hot, right?  I was like 22, 23, and I finally met her. 
[00:22:30]  She's walked past my house.  I met her one day and she...  I bet Rich doesn't get through this, by the way.  I'm just going to wager.  I think they already dumped once.  I think Al.  I don't know.  I think Al already dumped.  It doesn't matter, Al.  That's your graphic, Al.  I know what word he had a problem with, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Al.  Finished?  Keep it safe, Al.  Keep it safe.  We don't want people listening.  Yeah.  Al. 
[00:23:00]  Make sure you keep it safe, Al.  I don't even know why I'm doing that voice, but I like it.  Al.  I love it, too.  That should just say...  You know how the button says dump?  Yeah.  It should say listener dump.  Yeah.  So Al knows every time he hits it, listeners are just dumping out of the show.  It's not his fault, by the way.  Oh, I know.  He's just an idiot.  You get arms on him, too, this kid.  Looks good.  All right.  Go ahead, Rich.  So this girl, beautiful.  So anyhow, she ended up cheating on her boyfriend and came to my house.  Like, I was like 22, 23.  And we went... 
[00:23:30]  Beautiful.  We went to bed, and it was like maybe one movement, and I was done.  And she goes, well, this doesn't really count as cheating, because...  All right.  You're so awful.  You're so fast that she didn't even check it off in that column.  No, it's not cheating.  It wasn't like there was a man present here.  That's it.  Somebody rolled over on me and got out of bed.  It's like if you walk into a store by accident and walk right out.  You weren't shopping there.  No.  You didn't buy anything.  You just walked in, spit on the floor, and left. 
[00:24:00]  Walked out.  I was making out with a girl once in Montreal, just making out with her, and I was so excited.  All right.  All right.  Will you shut up?  Wait.  Did you?  Are you kidding me?  He obviously did.  Al, don't dump that out.  No one knows what we're talking about still.  From just kissing.  From just kissing.  Wow.  Beautiful, and there was a lot of buildup.  Wow.  All right.  Very nice.  Hey, during the break, we were talking about iPods really fast, because I went out and bought  an S-load of iPods.  That's right.  If you're a member of my family, you're getting a Nano for Christmas. 
[00:24:30]  Enjoy it.  Does Nana get a Nano?  Everybody does.  Everyone gets one.  Excuse me.  I like to program Nana's Nano, and you just put all sounds of like, boo, and ah, and things  that would scare her.  So she puts it on in between songs, because she has a lot of money, and she's constantly  grabbing her chest, and then grabbing the wall.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  I like to turn it up a little loud, so she can't hear you coming with a pillow at night.  Put it over that face.  What did she do to you? 
[00:25:00]  Wake up with those earbuds in, and her bent nose.  What did she do to you?  Nothing.  And you pull up the pillow, it's got her face print in it, and a silent scream of confusion.  All she did was love you.  The shroud of burden.  All she did was love you.  Why?  I know.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  It's great when they get so old, and you're having sex with them, and they think you're  washing them.  When the police come, I'm sorry, when the police come to take her body out, you try to act  to hang, you're like, we can't believe she died so suddenly, but as you're repainting 
[00:25:30]  her room, and there's a new desk brought in, is this being made into your study?  All she did was love you.  I know.  It's unfair.  Yes, all the way May, we'll be getting a Nano this year.  Ah!  So I'm in the old, what is it, an Apple store officially?  Is it an iPod store?  All I see is iPods.  So I was at the iPod store.  Where were you?  Walt Whitman Mall.  Oh, okay.  Got to say hi to the gang there.  By the way, bought all my stuff, then they were going to give me the discount when they  realized I was in the store, and I, Anthony, I said, fellas, don't worry about it. 
[00:26:00]  Take care of me next time.  That's how much I love your product.  Wow.  That's what I did.  What a guy.  I was discussing the iPod phenomenon with the gang in the store.  And they're saying this holiday season, it's completely out of control how many iPods  they're selling.  Yep.  And then I told them when we do the walk from, you know, Free FM here in New York City to  XM every day on the sidewalk, all we see, all we see is iPods.  People walking down the sidewalk with the iPod buds. 
[00:26:30]  It's unbelievable.  They don't want to talk or deal with other people.  And this continues with how we started the show today.  Then you got these executives in these dumb boardrooms, and they can't figure this crap  out.  Yep.  You know, they know this iPod phenomenon is happening.  So what do they do?  They use the same playbook from 40 years ago to program their radio stations.  I believe you got to give people something that they can't get.  Right.  Anywhere else.  Right.  So somebody invented the playbook for music radio. 
[00:27:00]  Here it is, the playbook.  And it worked for many years.  And when they invented the playbook, people were walking around with transistor radios.  I was going to go with the clunky, like, Walkmans.  Oh, the big headphones with the antennas sticking off?  I'm talking, you know, this is how long ago they created the playbook for music radio.  People were walking around with transistor radios.  They had to hold up to their ear.  Yeah.  You listened to the ball game.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  They didn't have headphones.  No.  And radio.  They had the one little ear thing that went in one ear.  That little, like, ivory-colored, yellowish thing that you stuck in one ear and plugged  into your transistor radio.  That was years later.  They didn't even have that in the beginning.  But stupid radio, they've been using the same playbook since then.  Even though now it's so much easier to carry around your own music.  Yep.  Just pop it on your iPod.  They're just a bunch of dopes.  Out of touch dopes. 
[00:28:00]  Dude, I do different stations and different, it's not CBS or Clear Channel.  It's all of them.  It's everyone involved in it.  And they do the same thing.  It's not just one company.  It's a bunch of people who have been in it too long who just want to retire without a  problem.  And I'm telling you, it stinks everywhere you go.  It's the same crap, the same schlocky nonsense, the little faggoty music bed you got to talk  over there right back to, we got to play five in an hour, we got to play, it's awful.  They're just panicking cowards everywhere you go. 
[00:28:30]  The people in the business, the DJ, nobody has one ounce of balls who desire to do anything  creative.  They just stink and they wonder why nobody wants to listen.  And this has been boiling under my skin since the Kramer thing because, you know, they  want us to be an edgy talk show here.  And this is a massive story and we can't even say the word.  And then we can't even play the other stuff that is happening because of this, like that  rap song.  Yep.  It's just amazing.  How are you supposed to be edgy and you don't even say the word that's in the biggest news  story of the year? 
[00:29:00]  And it's not a violation.  It's beyond stupid and they got to wake up.  Because in the end, we have another job.  In the end, we have another gig.  Like, so, you know, it's not going to hurt us.  It's going to hurt you guys, though.  I'm trying to wake you guys up.  There's just too big a gap between talent and upper, upper management.  Like, they don't understand each other.  There's no real communication there.  They have an agenda and talent has an agenda.  And it's so far from each other these days.  It's very difficult to do what you want to do. 
[00:29:30]  There you go.  What are they afraid of?  An advertiser?  Yeah.  Is going to run away because you played that?  Yeah.  Again, you saw what happened with the Seinfeld DVD.  Any type of controversy, people don't care.  People aren't that affected by some stupid boycott.  No one cares.  No one participates in boycotts.  No one.  No one.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we just said it.  But the Seinfeld season seven is outselling season six by 75%.  And this is an outrage, outraged people calling for a boycott for something that was so highly 
[00:30:00]  publicized that if any boycott would have worked, this should have.  Yep.  But no, it doesn't.  Boycotts make things sell more.  That's how it works.  And believe me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Believe me, we know that, you know, Seinfeld is being bought by a lot of people.  It's not being bought by a bunch of...  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry, man.  And the Kramer app, already up to 250,000 views on Break.com.  That's where the listeners of this radio show go to. 
[00:30:30]  So the suits have got to start, you know, figuring out what the listeners are doing when  they're not listening to your radio stations.  They go to YouTube.  They go to Break.com.  We can list a ton of sites that you've never heard of.  MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  They're all over there.  Oh, wow.  All the fun stuff is up.  There you go.  Heart goes out to Kramer, Mel Gibson says.  I bet he does.  I bet you Michael Richards is reading this in Hollywood somewhere going, oh, great.  Mel, will you shut the F up?  I don't need you on this one.  I got one supporter, Mel Gibson, is coming to my corner. 
[00:31:00]  Brother, I'm screwed.  That's his only support is Mel Gibson.  Michael Richards may still be reeling from public reaction.  Hold on a minute.  I'm reeling, Jerry.  He's reeling.  Even Tom Metzger.  This is the most publicity he's had since he was on Seinfeld.  Even more.  Let's say hi to Craig at Woodside.  Craig.  Hey, Craig.  Guys, can we move on already?  Let's go. 
[00:31:30]  Why don't you move on to another station?  That's a good one.  That's a good one, Hopi.  Oh.  He's right, dude.  That's a good one.  Oh.  I've tased him.  That is a good one.  If you don't like it, don't listen.  Bye.  Michael Richards may still be reeling from public reaction to his racist rant at a comedy club,  but he should know he's not alone.  Mel Gibson feels his pain.  I bet he does.  I felt like sending Michael Richards a note.  A note?  I wonder what that would read.  No kidding. 
[00:32:00]  It's like, ah, the Jews are the problem, not the blacks.  They send funny notes back to each other.  I think they smell more because of, no, they're more stinkier because of.  Yeah, but who's running the media?  Yeah, but who's committing all the crimes?  And they elbow each other's ribs good nature.  Huddle, huddle.  See you next week.  I felt like sending Michael Richards a note, Gibson says, and blah, blah, blah.  I feel really bad for the guy.  He was obviously in a state of stress.  You don't need to be inebriated to be bent out of shape, but my heart went out to the guy. 
[00:32:30]  The 50-year-old actor-director told Entertainment Weekly, Richards will feel the heat for a while,  but the scandal will blow over.  They'll probably torture him for a while and then let him go, the Braveheart actor said.  The Braveheart actor.  And then he ends it by saying, I like him.  I like him.  I'm sure, Craig.  It's a good egg.  Oh, come on, man.  Mel, just stay out of this one.  Jenny sent Mussolini a note.  Why does it look, the guy, it's like, people are so afraid of getting, 
[00:33:00]  like, a boycott against them or something.  Why can't people just apologize?  They always have to talk about healing and all this crap.  Oh, the healing.  Just shut your mouth.  I have to go into therapy for this.  I'm just busted up about it.  Just apologize like you did and move on.  Right.  Leave it alone.  What I said was awful.  I got crazy.  I wanted to hurt the guy because he was heckling me,  and I went for the absolute most hurtful thing.  I never should have done.  And if there was a human apology, I bet you Jesse Jackson and them, 
[00:33:30]  what are you going to call for a boycott?  But his apology stunk so much that black people are watching it going,  could you at least give us a reason to move on?  Black people couldn't even.  It was so awful, they had to call for a boycott.  They usually don't call for a boycott after you apologize on Letterman and a black show.  Yeah.  Normally, people move on.  But he was so, Katrina, and you guys run around,  and your toes look like macadamia nuts.  All right, we get it.  He didn't know what he was saying.  You hear the latest on him, though,  that he was accused of being anti-Semitic also, 
[00:34:00]  and he said that he's Jewish,  and they researched his background,  and neither of his parents are Jewish.  He took it on.  Then he said he never converted or anything either,  but he said he was mentored by people that were Jewish,  so he considers himself Jewish.  Oh, boy.  That's it.  Take on the religion that's most hated on the planet.  I'm not a real Jew, but I want people to hate me like,  I don't know.  What, you don't think Muslims are... 
[00:34:30]  Are you kidding me?  In show business?  Very risky to be a Jew.  Shut up.  I think Muslims at this day and age kind of...  Wrong.  The number one hated group,  especially in this country,  are Jews on any white supremacy list.  Oh, he's right.  He's right.  Wait, wait.  No, as far as white supremacy...  They've got to update the list, then.  There's 10 white supremacists that are organized these days,  and they think Jews are at the top of the list.  Jews are more hated than Muslims right now.  Throughout the world.  In America.  Yeah, in America and the world.  You said America, too.  Yes, America and the world.  I don't...  Not in America.  There's no way.  Not in America. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know about America.  I don't know.  You fell down to number two.  I know.  Not in America.  Because Muslims did not affect people in the Midwest and the South  like it did on the East Coast, okay?  It really didn't affect them as much as it did here.  Voss.  I know what it is.  My only argument with Voss on this one is that in America...  Are you adding in self-hating, too?  I knew Voss was going to say something dumb because his hand came out.  Whenever his hand comes out, the little stiff thing won't bend.  Oh, I know.  But no, Rich, it's like, look, they attacked America, 
[00:35:30]  and the Midwest, they didn't get hit, but that tapped into that whole...  They hit old glory.  Believe me, the Midwest felt it.  I think Jews might be number two by Muslims here,  but in the world, it's absolutely Jews.  The whole Middle East hates Jews.  They're all Muslims.  Yeah, I don't know about the world, but I think I know a little bit about America,  and I would have to say the Jews are in second place at this point.  It just has to be.  Has to be.  We'll do something.  Well, when they find out, we orchestrated the whole...  Yeah.  Wow.  Already working on that.  Steven from Bayshore, Gibson's note said, 
[00:36:00]  keep up the good work.  And what do you feel about them suing him?  How bad that would be for comedy?  Who would pay money?  If Kramer paid any money, how bad that would be?  It wouldn't matter.  Nobody else would pay.  Let him pay.  No.  Hey, by the way, Jamie Masada, the owner of The Laugh Factory,  I forgot to tell you this.  He called me yesterday, and I was unavailable because I was getting my teeth scraped.  Oh, brother.  You sweetie.  I want to say hi to the gang at the old dentist's office in Huntington.  I was scraping my teeth yesterday afternoon. 
[00:36:30]  But I don't know what he wanted.  I guess we should call him and see what's going on.  It's a little early.  It's been like he had something.  No.  It's a little early.  I like that.  The urgent communique.  All right.  Anyway, Mel Gibson has that new movie coming out December 8th,  The Mayan Language Adventure.  Can't even pronounce it.  Apocalypto.  Thank you, Anthony.  Apocalypto.  Apocalypto.  You watch what numbers that movie does.  What's it about?  Do we know?  Apocalypto?  Mayan.  I think it's, yeah.  Thanks.  Um, something about, um, yeah. 
[00:37:00]  What is he doing?  The extinction of what?  The Mayan people?  No one cares.  How about another lethal weapon, Mel?  How about being Martin Riggs and hitting on Danny Glover's daughter in those films?  I wanted to see her get it good.  Oh.  A little sexy thing with her straight white girl hair.  She was very attractive.  Yeah.  When him and Danny are on, when Danny's in the toilet and Mel's helping him, how hot was that?  And how many, you know something?  I just can't get enough when he says, I'm getting too old for this, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, it's just funny.  Where they're both in the car together and the car leaves the ground and they look at each other and go, whoa! 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, but you missed the one in the deleted out scenes when, uh, Danny Glover said, I'm getting too old for this.  And then, uh, Martin said, yeah, well, at least you're not partnered up with a.  Oh.  I missed that.  Was that in the, uh, deleted scenes on the DVD?  Yeah, because they all laughed like Dom DeLuise in the cannonball run-out take, so they couldn't use it.  By the way, don't worry, Al, we're taking care of it over here with the beep. 
[00:38:00]  We're self-beeping, Al.  Al.  Hey, we like Al, by the way.  Oh, yeah, we are.  Sure.  We don't have a problem with Al.  Al's got to, look, I mean this.  Well, we've got to beat up somebody for this crap.  Al's got a great body on him.  I mean, the guy's been in the gym working out, and we all noticed his arms, and the way he has, like, the little, the tummy is small.  Who cares?  He's got a job to do.  All right, we've got lots to do.  Hey, uh, you guys hear about this principal, this high school principal with the foot fetish?  Ooh.  Not only does he have a foot fetish, he has a Hitler mustache. 
[00:38:30]  The last, the last guy on the face of the earth with a Hitler mustache.  You mean he used to have a wood floor?  He got a note from Bill Gibson, too.  Yeah.  He, uh, yeah, he's, he's got a Hitler mustache.  Yeah.  He went for, for the look.  Yeah.  That everyone has shunned, uh, since World War II.  That, he, Hitler ruined that look.  That mustache would have come back.  Every mustache comes back.  The Fu Manchu, the goatee, the, the, even that wacky, uh, rolly fingers, handlebar mustache. 
[00:39:00]  Only creeps, uh, wear that.  Yeah, the handlebar mustache is really creepy.  Every time you see, see a guy with the, that, uh, yeah, that handlebar mustache, it's, you  can just tell he's a creep.  Where do you buy mustache wax?  There's some underage touching going on.  Pull it out of your ears.  Right next to the, right next to the kid toys and other things that get them into a van,  because the same people buying those objects.  Yeah, there's underage touching going on.  Tickle me, Elmo.  Mustache wax. 
[00:39:30]  When kids are bad in the school, they make them sit in a fake oven, the principal.  Oh, Rich.  Go home.  Go home.  Just go home.  Please.  Do us all a favor.  But that was a Jewish joke.  That wasn't that bad.  It was kind of cruel.  It was good.  It was just five minutes late.  We're talking about something else now, mustache wax, and you're going back to Hitler.  Yeah.  Rich, I forgot.  Every time you're here, we, we set up the penalty box.  Remember.  Okay.  Remember.  We're going to send you to the penalty box.  So he not only has the Hitler mustache, but he's got a foot fetish or what? 
[00:40:00]  Well, I don't know.  Let's, let's get into the audio.  It's a couple quick clips.  By the way, everyone's asking us about Danny DeVito.  We don't have enough time to start that right, right here, but we will talk about that very  soon.  Yeah.  Danny DeVito drunk on The View yesterday.  It's just horrific.  Yeah.  High school principal with foot fetish.  This is the man that Lorraine police say has a foot fetish.  Robert Holloway was dressed in a suit and tie looking much like many other professionals.  But police say Holloway has a secret life. 
[00:40:30]  They say Holloway's school computer was filled with hundreds of pictures of male feet.  Police also say they believe Holloway's foot fetish is what led him to kiss the feet of three  14-year-old boys at St. Anthony of Padua.  Wait, can you please?  They, they, that led police to believe he has photos of men's feet.  He kissed three boys' feet and some detective went, wait, guys, I see a connection.  Wait, wait, I might be onto something here. 
[00:41:00]  You think that's connected?  I don't buy it.  I'm not positive, but.  Did he call the gym teacher?  I don't want these kids playing kickball.  Yeah, he just wanted them doing like nice soft things.  I want them to lay on their mat and have lotion put on their feet for recess.  It's nothing but sit-ups all day long and he's got to hold their feet down.  Wow, look at this.  Sit-ups again.  I'm looking at a picture.  Yeah, there's a picture there, Jim.  He's got the big like Coke bottle glasses that make his eyes look all creepy.  Yeah, all those feet must have looked huge to him in those glasses. 
[00:41:30]  You know what?  He has the mustache, so when he rubs his nose in between their toes,  he comes away with a little something he can sniff on the ride home.  It cleans it.  It's like a little whisk brush for toe jam.  Well, the principal is pleading not guilty.  Holloway entered a plea of not guilty to five counts,  including sexual imposition and illegal use of property.  The former Catholic school principal would not say much about those charges. 
[00:42:00]  We entered the plea and we're going to follow through with the regular court proceedings.  Police say Holloway kissed the boy's feet as part of a bet.  They also say he did it in private, giving each boy 50 kisses on their bare feet.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  What was the bet you lost?  All right.  All right.  What's the problem with the kids?  Look, I understand four or five.  You know, you're hanging out for 50.  What's the bet?  I bet I can do this and not have to throw my boxers in the washer after?  What is the bet? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, what is the bet?  How many points does your team have to lose by before you're kissing a boy's feet?  50 times.  50.  Do you think it was quick pecs?  Or do you think he really started, like, making out with these boys' feet?  How many would you last?  What?  How many kisses to the foot?  None.  How many would you last?  My friggin' big toe would be full of Hitler mustache hair. 
[00:43:00]  I'd kick this guy right in the face.  That's where we're a little different.  What?  For a goof, I'd let him do a couple.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Now you're just weird.  Dude, I would tap out at 45.  Yeah, you know.  Maybe not 45, but you got to see where this is going.  You got to give him a couple.  If he's anything like the girl in Montreal, I'd only last two.  All right.  Yeah, was the Reverend Al counting out the kisses?  One kiss. 
[00:43:30]  Two kisses.  There's no reason for 50 kisses.  I am outraged.  Actually, I think he would probably get two in, because I think they're rapid fire.  So even you would last more than one kiss in, I'm telling you.  Dude, I wouldn't be standing there barefoot in front of this creep.  Well, what if I...  As I am 14 years old.  What if you just happen to be in some weird situation and you happen to have no shoes on?  What if you're wearing sandals?  I never wear sandals.  And he jumps down on all fours and you're like, whoa, what the...  Whoa, hey, what's this about? 
[00:44:00]  No.  It never happened.  I never...  Back there at John H. Glenn with good old Coach Cirillo.  Yeah.  Never would have happened.  He was all man.  All man.  He'd wrap you in the head if you forgot your goddamn sneakers.  It's got to be a scenario where you have no shoes on and all of a sudden, you know, this creep is kissing your feet.  I'm not saying you're letting...  How did it get that far?  I'm not saying you're letting him do it.  What, you're just standing around the locker room and all of a sudden you look down and the coach is kissing your bare feet? 
[00:44:30]  I don't think that could happen.  I think you'd see him creeping up on you.  There's a great ending to this story, by the way.  He dies?  You know the way...  You know they were long kisses.  Like, you know the way he did it was like...  He's like, all right, let's play.  He kept it good-natured.  And when he grabbed that foot, he held it with both hands and he kissed like...  What do you think?  One hand around the back of the ankle.  One hand, left hand, cupping the ankle.  The other in the arch.  No, the other on top of the foot.  Is that what you're saying? 
[00:45:00]  Like, one under the ankle, one on top of the foot, cradling it like one would cradle an object of rare beauty.  With the toes sort of hanging over by where his pinky and the edge of his hand are on the arch?  It would be like holding an Oscar.  Is that it?  Like how they hold an Oscar when they're accepting the night?  They don't want that Oscar to be, you know, let go of.  And the first two were probably...  Or the first couple of kisses were probably like, all right, I got this bed.  So just... 
[00:45:30]  And he looked up and probably...  All right.  Yeah, all right.  Here's one.  And then by the time he's done, it's just like from here to eternity, the beach scene.  He's rolling around with the foot.  What are you doing?  This little piggy went to Marcus.  Oh boy, Uncle Paul.  Hey, uh...  You sure that's how he sounds?  To a creep?  This story has a great ending.  Listen to this.  Holloway resigned as principal of St. Anthony's and the three students involved are now in high school. 
[00:46:00]  Now Holloway and his attorney must decide what the next step will be in his defense.  Well, Holloway will be back in court on December 11th for a pre-trial.  The former principal now works for the city of Cleveland at a cemetery.  Oh, okay.  He works at a Cleveland cemetery.  Oh my God.  He's got a lot of feet to kiss.  Kissing the feet of those dead Midwestern idiots.  Bunch of stupid Browns fans laying face down. 
[00:46:30]  Spitting little toe bones out.  Oh, you know he's kissing the feet of the cadavers.  Curly yellow toenails because they kept growing after he's dead.  Big long knuckle hair because it kept growing.  Even death can't stop you from growing.  All right.  That guy is a creep.  What a good boy.  What a ghoul.  Goes to a cemetery.

[00:48:30]  Hey, Joe.  What's up, buddy?  There he is.  I know you.  Are you the one that did the video of the illegal aliens?  Yeah, man.  Is he going to ignore me?  I'm talking to you, sir.  I'm talking to you, sir.  He's doing the room.  He's a racist.  You did the Klan video, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was the greatest.  The Klan video on all the black neighborhoods we had.  He had the Klan outfit on.  Pumping gas in a black neighborhood wearing a Klan outfit.  Yeah, Joe, what's your friend's name again? 
[00:49:00]  Ari, right?  Ari.  Ari?  Oh, God.  That's hysterical.  You ever see the one where he picked up the immigrants?  Yeah.  He picks them all up.  That's the one I was asking through his face.  We're talking about the amazing racists.  Joe's friend Ari.  Yeah.  I saw where you pick up the illegal immigrants to work.  The day workers.  Yeah.  I saw that one.  Great, man.  These videos are all over the internet.  Those videos kept him from coming on the Maxim tour.  The Maxim and Bud Light wouldn't let him come on the tour with me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They said it was just too offensive. 
[00:49:30]  Really?  Yep.  Congrats.  Did Bud Light mention what their product causes people to do behind the wheel of a car?  Nothing.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's a wonderful, wonderful, we love it.  Hey, hey.  I love Bud Light.  Tom's going to bring you to the corner next, Jimmy.  It makes you drive better.  I love it.  Tom Chisano's going to have a little conversation with you in the corner next break.  Oh, the sponsor, sorry.  Miller Light's bad.  There you go.  Miller Light, you have great judgment.  Miller Light.  They're all wonderful.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  What is our goal?  Beer, beer.  What is our goal?  To have every member of the show have a conversation in the corner with Tom Chisano? 
[00:50:00]  You know what?  You know what?  You want to bash something?  Meister Brow.  There you go.  It's all...  That's right.  It's Meister Brow.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  You got to explain...  Milwaukee's best.  Hold on.  You got to explain the video because we're just talking about this video, but there's a lot  of people listening that have never seen this video.  So explain what you did with the illegal immigrants.  It is me.  Are we in...  Yeah.  We're in FM, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's me messing with ethnic people.  So...  Day workers.  Yeah.  We've seen them on every corner in America at this point. 
[00:50:30]  You know, they just hang out waiting to get work for the day.  Yeah.  And you come by with a pickup truck and you pick up a bunch of them.  I get in.  I drive over some speed bumps.  And just have some fun for a little while.  And then one of the guys are fixing my deck.  And then I drove to the INS building and just started blowing a whistle, yelling, let me grow.  Let me grow.  Immigration, naturalization services.  So they thought...  And they scattered like cockroaches.  Migre, migre, migre. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, they freaked out.  They ran out.  That was on the news.  And the reporters, the same reporters who report, you know, murders and child abduction  and just horrific crimes, were actually looking like, this isn't funny.  What you're about to see is horrid.  But, you know, they'll show a dead body or this, that.  But that was over the line for them.  Dude, you made the news.  Oh, yeah.  It was so funny.  Because then they showed the clip. 
[00:51:30]  Of course they did.  I love when people have to say, this isn't funny.  What you're about to watch.  Yeah, this isn't funny.  What you're about to watch when we play it 20 times here on the news.  If I'm laughing, it's funny.  Right.  Who do you say what's funny?  Yeah, exactly.  It's like when Kramer was on Letterman.  Yeah.  Jerry Seinfeld told the audience, stop laughing.  Yeah, stop laughing.  What are you talking about?  I'm laughing.  It is funny.  And did you all love it?  Don't tell me what's funny.  Yeah.  I've watched that clip too many times.  And the way Jerry goes, no, stop, stop laughing.  It's like he even knows, all right, I know you got to laugh at this. 
[00:52:00]  But could you please for a second not?  And it's the first time anybody has laughed at Michael Richards since he walked off the set of that show.  No one cares about it on stage.  Think you're conceptual.  And don't be mistaken, Jerry Seinfeld's laughing really hard in his own head.  Oh, now he's laughing too.  Now that season seven is selling 75% more than season six sold.  Really?  Because of the boycott.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  Why don't people understand that? 
[00:52:30]  If people are outraged and boycott and this has been on the news and then the DVD comes in, you couldn't ask for that.  If it wasn't what it was, you'd almost think they planned that.  It was perfectly executed.  The timing was perfect.  There he is on Letterman with Seinfeld apologizing as Seinfeld is plugging his brand new DVDs.  It's brilliant.  Our friend Brent was over at the Laugh Factor when it was happening and he came running back over to the comedy stores right down the street and was like, whoa, we got crazy. 
[00:53:00]  And we were like, Michael Richards.  I mean, he had been on at the comedy store just like an hour before and he killed.  He was going crazy.  One of those weird sets.  Yeah, yeah.  He was screaming.  Did you see it?  Did you see his set?  No, Jeff don't.  Wait, so before the Laugh Factor he was at the comedy store.  Yeah, he went to the comedy store just an hour before.  Only a couple miles of parties.  Yeah, not even.  A mile maybe.  Yeah.  And is he a yelling guy?  Is that his act?  I can't tell.  We think he might have been on some sort of a substance that causes you to be aggressive and confident. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Was he yelling the N-word?  Aggressive and confident.  Okay.  Was he yelling the N-word at the comic store?  No, no, no, no.  At the comedy store?  But he was being really loud and animated and he had some hot little bimbo with him and then he ran down the street and tried it over there.  Oops.  He had a chick with him?  You know what?  That explains something because if his girl saw him bombing, we've all bombed in front of a broad before.  It's humiliating and so I'm being emasculated by that table, that might explain why he went so crazy because he had a broad with him. 
[00:54:00]  That makes a lot of sense to me.  Maybe she told him a little secret about her past on the way from point A to point B.  I want to tell you guys how I lost my virginity.  State football team.  We never have a state then.  Jamie said if you say the N-word, you get fined there.  Buddy, I fined you.  I take the money away from you, buddy.  Buddy, you can't do this at my place.  There goes your Sunday show right out the window.  Urban show.  What are they going to do?  Talk about Sunday show. 
[00:54:30]  Is that what he's saying?  He's fining people now?  Yeah, he's fining people.  He's banned the word from the last factor.  Somebody needs to duct tape Jamie and tell him to stop.  He called me yesterday.  I don't know what he wants.  Buddy, I got to talk to you.  Yeah, we're trying to get him on the show.  It's getting crazy.  I fined people when they use that word.  I say, that's fine.  I don't really have a problem with it.  I actually sided with him because I don't work the club, only because I think he's afraid  to get his club burned down.  Because out there, I don't think it's a reaction like a PC reaction.  I think it's like, well, if I don't do this, somebody is going to take a shot at somebody  driving me.  I got hate email over it. 
[00:55:00]  Somebody thought it was me.  What?  How'd you do it?  Some bark dude thought it was me.  I thought it was you.  Why?  You are the furthest person apart.  You are in opposite ends of the spectrum.  But I'm white.  Oh, I guess so.  Every white comic got, like, hate mail.  Right.  I saw what you did.  He sent me this crazy hate mail saying, you're the N-word in this and that, you know?  And then I sent him, I go, is that a good thing?  With a question mark.  And then he sent me back, and, you know, are you that guy that did that?  I go, no.  And he goes, sorry, jackass. 
[00:55:30]  And then you wrote back and called him an N.  No.  Anyway.  I said, you have a good day, sir.  Sir.  What's the thing about this whole incident?  It might put Lisa Labanelli out of work.  That's what I'm saying.  How nice would that be?  If she could go, she's just five minutes and he's like, you're off stage.  All right.  No more chink spook.  Nothing else.  No other groundbreaking.  Why?  Does she use that word?  Oh, I don't know.  She's fresh, though, Joe.  I don't get tangled up with her.  I don't need that kind of controversy. 
[00:56:00]  When one doesn't have something in her mouth, she uses it.  I'll say one thing for Lisa, though.  She does take her act home with her.  She doesn't just walk out of the club and all of a sudden start talking to her peers.  It's right in the car with one of them.  You hear what I said?  Joe Rogan playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Joe.  See you.  All right.  Very good.  We got Danny DeVito audio we got to get to.  You hear what Danny did last night?  Yeah, we were watching it.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad. 
[00:56:30]  He was obviously drunk.  Yeah.  But he wasn't talking about it.  Hey, let me tell you about a gay experience I had last night.  He wasn't completely out of his mind.  He was drunk.  It was a little early in the morning to be drunk, but apparently he pulled an all-nighter.  Yeah.  Who was he hanging out with?  George Clooney.  George Clooney.  The sexiest man of the year.  Wow.  And he's hanging out with him.  He goes on The View.  He's still tipsy.  And he was babbling about his movie and George Bush. 
[00:57:00]  It wasn't that bad.  And Barbara Walters is sitting there just looking at him all nervous, and they're bleeping  out words that he's saying that I read that was just ridiculous.  It's a...  Numb?  Yeah.  I think they might dump it here.  No.  It's a word that means stupid.  It has no sexual meaning whatsoever when you say, hey, numbnuts.  Now, let's wait and see what happens.  Let's see what cooks, what simmers.  Ow. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, Al.  Did you dump out of that one?  Ow.  Did they decide to dump out on that owl?  Okay, Al.  Did you hear the fact that when you said it, I went, no, like I'm somebody's grandfather.  Yeah.  Well, shake your fist at children on the lawn and shut up.  There's a lot of expressions like that, like blew his wad.  That's a gambling term.  Right.  You know, that's about a wad of cash.  To wad of cash.  There's nothing in the...  Just keep it there.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  To wad of cash.  Joe knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  That's it.  I only got a thumbs up on that one.  Okay.  Unlike other people in the studio.  What?  That have to over-explain things. 
[00:58:00]  Rich the dump boss.  Rich.  We could sit there and just artistically maneuver our way around a subject so the listener gets  a picture in their head about exactly what we're talking about.  We're like black ninjas.  We're moving and...  Yeah.  Moving.  Just making sure now the people know what we're talking about.  Everything's fine.  And he'll just go, oh, her pussy.  And you're like, Rich, I just spent like 15 minutes painting this picture and he drops 
[00:58:30]  like the P-bomb.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  I got the best boss story ever in regards to words you're not supposed to use.  We were at Dangerfields once and it was, what was it, like 12 years ago or something  like that?  And we were downstairs and he tells this joke and I go, dude, tell that joke on stage,  please.  He goes, oh, I can't tell her on stage.  So he goes up on stage.  The joke is he goes, before she dated Mike Tyson, Robin Givens dated, what is it, Eddie 
[00:59:00]  Murphy?  Go ahead.  Tell the joke.  She dated Eddie Murphy, Michael Jordan.  Is it me or is she an N lover?  And the audience just stares at him.  They just stare at him.  All you hear is me over by the bar laughing my ass off.  Never forget that.  That is funny.  He was killing.  He was killing up until that moment.  They just decided to throw it in there.  I don't know what Al dumped out, but basically, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  I think he's fine with that.  We'll skate all around and then Voss will bring it over the top and explain what we  were.  Voss will just blatantly throw the word out that we were trying to finesse around.  Right.  So everyone would stay on the same page.  Never felt.  So ridiculous.  Grown adults.  We have to skirt around words.  How ridiculous does it seem to you guys after doing the XM show for a long time?  Yeah.  It's one of those things where it's like.  Hence the conversation I just had in the corner with Tom Chiasano.  I thought he was going to ask.  I was just taken to a corner there, Joe.  I thought he was going to ask to kiss your feet 50 times. 
[01:00:00]  You could have taught me a couple moves to get me out of that one.  By the way, they dumped out of that word, Ant.  Yes.  Oh, well, I know they dumped out of that one.  I know.  It's too bad because you got a huge laugh.  That's why I wanted to re-explain it that we skate and maneuver and then Voss will take  it over the top.  Blurt out the word.  And wreck everything.  It was a part of the female anatomy.  I just blurted it out that that isn't a friendly word.  Or kitty cat.  Right.  Right.  Or a kitty cat.  You can say it that way, right?  Exactly.  You're a good Joe.  Can't you say like someone's being one?  Yeah, you can say that. 
[01:00:30]  You can say that.  Yeah, but now, because of what we just did before, now we can.  Now we can.  Until later when we change subjects perhaps.  This is very complicated, Joe.  It is so complicated.  I'd rather go eat some worms or something.  It's so hilarious.  Yeah.  You still have to do this.  It's 2006 and that hasn't changed.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  That was the point I was making.  Of course, femur marrow or something.  But I made my point too well and hence the conversation I had to have in a corner.  Was it a scolding?  It didn't seem like a scolding.  It was a little bit. 
[01:01:00]  I didn't see him wagging his finger at you.  It was a little scolding.  It would have been so funny if he took you over in the corner and just tried to make out  with you.  Totally disconnected from me.  You want to keep your job, right?  You want to keep your job?  Come here.  Come here, baby.  Put your tongue out a little bit.  I'm just going to touch tongue.  A nuzzle.  What are you doing?  Brent this morning.  Grabs you around the waist and the back of your head.  We started the show by showing some passion for what we do.  Why do they always pick me out, man?  You were agreeing with what I was saying. 
[01:01:30]  I'm likable.  That's the truth, Joe.  Because Ann's right with me.  He's right with me.  But Tom said, I want to talk to you.  Not, I want to talk to you guys.  What was the subject?  You know, just, uh...  Well, let's just say it was, um, the differences between two mediums.  That's all.  Okay.  I think that pretty much spells it out.  And something about making his job tougher.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And we'll continue at 11 o'clock today. 
[01:02:00]  And I had just got done, uh, conveying my fantastic experiences I had with Mac.  So he loves you.  The night before, so...  Everyone loves Anthony.  I'm lovable.  You certainly are.  Except my neighbors.  All right.  Joe Rogan, uh, at Caroline's all weekend long.  We got your videos up on our website.  So you can check it out.  Ari, right?  Ari.  What's your last name again?  Shafir.  Yeah, right on.  Uh, his amazing racist videos are up on opiananthony.com.  He's a Jew.  I can't how to say it.  We also have Jed performing today. 
[01:02:30]  When we get back, uh, because we just don't have time to start it, uh, the drunk Danny DeVito  from The View.  Yeah.  Right after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jingle bell, jingle bell.  Jingle home.  Yeah.  Whoa, hey.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas  presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along. 
[01:03:00]  Golden buns is gonna get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and plomber as we partake in another  homeless shopping spree on The Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Governors.  Friday, Saturday.  The governor.  Ah, memories.  Which governor?  I've been in that place forever.  There's only one now, I think.  Oh, they, okay, the number's 516-731-3358. 
[01:03:30]  They could be closed.  This is in Levittown.  The one that was in the Montauk lighthouse.  I guess they closed that one down.  Jesus Christ.  Could you put one out further out east?  Is that what the deal was?  Jesus.  You could see the lights of England when you left the club.  Enough.  You could drive out to Medford, Long Island.  And we got Joe Rogan in studio with his friend Ari, who's the amazing racist.  What's going on, Gus?  His videos are pretty impressive.  They're up on opiananthony.com.  He's a very funny comedian, too.  He's an open-informe in Carolina.  Obviously, he's got a good sense of humor. 
[01:04:00]  Jesus.  That whole thing Jimmy was telling me, you did one where you were pumping gas in a Klan  uniform.  Yeah, I had a Klan outfit on because I had to.  In a black neighborhood.  Yeah.  The idea was that I ran out of money.  Did someone attack you?  Of course somebody attacked him.  What happened?  Homeless guy threw a bottle at us and broke the windshield because I asked him where the  chicken places were.  He's like an 80-year-old homeless guy. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, boy.  Oh, my God.  This is wrong.  Hey, boy.  Yeah.  Where the chicken places is.  Then he goes, oh, KKK?  He looked like he remembered.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  Something I had with his bottles.  It was a little too real for the United States.  Wow.  What did you do at a mosque?  Didn't you do something at a mosque?  Yeah, I went in there and tried to sell them stuff.  I had my yarmulke on.  Oh, Jake.  And tried to sell them goods and services.  I tried to sell them Bic razors for their wives' beards and shaving cream, stuff like  that.  Didn't you ask a chick, would you ask her if she had a bomb under her skirt or something 
[01:05:00]  like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I tried lifting it up.  I was like, what do you want under here?  I think that's one of my favorite lines, actually.  They're like, nah, do what you want.  I don't care.  And with a yarmulke, you can't look any more Jewish.  No, I'm the Jewiest guy I know.  You're like to the second power.  Yeah.  The ones where the crawls go, he's a Jew, bro.  All right, let's get to the-  I know you, you murderer.  Let's get to the Danny DeVito stuff.  So we're saying it's not that big of a deal. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, all the morning shows here in New York, Good Morning America, Today Show.  Well, they're all picking up on it just for the fact that he was drunk on The View, and  for some reason, you know, that's an outrageous thing for Danny DeVito to do.  Rosie was handling it well, you know, Rosie was having fun with it.  Barbara was sitting there like an old frump, just worrying and cutting him off and, you  know, just worrying about her show.  That's the kind of stuff that gets, look, it's all over into the shows.  That's what you want.  How do you think Barbara got to the top, by the way? 
[01:06:00]  Because she's just awful.  I don't get it.  She was a serious journalist.  Remember that girl that got fired from that show?  Was it a Melissa?  Was it a blonde?  Yeah, the cute one.  Yeah, yeah.  She came on Fear Factor once.  She was working for TV Guide, and she was telling horrible shit stories about working  on that show.  Really?  It was horrible.  You know, she said Barbara Walters was just an awful person, gave her a curfew and yell  at her.  Curfew?  You were out late, it makes us look bad, and she had a curfew.  She had to come home at a certain time.  She said Star Jones smelled like garbage, too. 
[01:06:30]  Like garbage.  She said like dirty garbage.  At that point, she was probably rummaging through dumpsters eating anything she could.  I did The View three times.  You did?  Did you really?  Yeah, three times.  What did you do in The View?  Two times I did Joy's Comedy Corner, and you know, they interview comics.  You do your acting.  Right.  And then one time I went on as a celebrity judge, because they couldn't get anybody and  got to the V's.  They wanted me to like trash.  They wanted me to be like a Simon Cowell or something. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, God.  And I was being nice, and they got mad, because you know, you can't trash a little kid.  Right.  Yes, you can.  Oh, you can.  Huh?  Of course you can.  If he's a jerk.  Isn't it funny how one person has a successful thing?  Like, oh, he picks on people, so then everybody wants to do that thing?  Has to do it.  It's called Hollywood.  Every one of the American Idol type shows has to have the guy with the English accent  that berates people.  Smarmy.  Crazy.  Come on.  All right.  It works with him.  It kind of comes off as, you know, that's the type of guy he is. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Looks so phony on all the other shows.  Whenever there's a copycat, it's never quite as good.  Yeah.  Never good.  I don't think they're trying to.  Have you noticed?  Xerox of a Xerox.  Have you noticed that Rosie has taken over the view?  Yeah.  I know.  This is the hen moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's like a bunch of fat wash women.  We're talking about Rosie and Barbara.  But stupid Barbara is just an irrelevant old bag, and it's nice to see big, dikey Rosie  knocking her teeth at her.  It's nice to see it.  Yeah, I kind of like it.  It's a comic.  And Joy's a comic.  They're the only interesting ones on.  It's going to be her TV show eventually.  It's good.  It should be.  They'll rename it and everything. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Danny DeVito on The View yesterday.  Danny has been out partying all night with...  Tell them.  I'm so jealous.  George.  George.  How gross is that?  Say Clooney, stupid.  Yeah.  Say the full name.  What are you doing?  He's bombed.  George.  George.  Bombed.  That's a gross thing, though, that celebrities do.  They only say the first name.  Black guys love doing it.  I was hanging out with Eddie.  Yeah.  Would it be Murphy?  You know what? 
[01:08:30]  The worst was...  And I remember this from watching Carson, The Tonight Show, when someone would say,  Yeah, well, it was me and...  Let me tell you a story about me and Chuck Heston.  We...  Oh, yeah.  Chuck Heston.  The nickname.  Could you stop with the Chuck Heston?  We get it.  You know him a little better than we do.  Oh.  We get it.  A little better.  Gross.  Right.  You're talking to millions of people.  Say the whole name.  Well, Danny, obviously, you could hear it in his voice.  My dad would say, he was three sheets to the wind.  Oh, well... 
[01:09:00]  That's what Dad would say.  He was hanging out with Clooney.  You know he was just slamming him back going,  Oh, God, I'm a disaster compared to this guy.  And again, I'm the other guy.  Why did Clooney start talking with Danny DeVito?  I'm a genetic freak.  Get me another shot.  Danny DeVito.  I just picture the shots, the doing the shot scene from Dusk Till Dawn.  Right.  With DeVito sitting there, tipping the tequila upside down.  I bet Danny DeVito would be really fun to hang out with.  We tried getting him in here, but we had him on the phone once.  He was great.  We wanted him in here so badly.  We'll let him drink.  He was even drunk.  He's charismatic on that show. 
[01:09:30]  He's not a jerk at all.  All right, let's listen to the rest of this clip here.  No, I knew it was the last seven limoncellos that was going to get me.  Yes, exactly.  Have you been to sleep yet?  Not really.  Don't do it now.  I'm going to wait a while.  Wait a couple of minutes.  Everybody's having fun and laughing, and that rotten old sucked-in-face bag of meat is probably  just sitting there wishing she was on 2020 again.  She was sitting there looking at him like, how dare you come to my show in this condition? 
[01:10:00]  How dare you?  You know, it's supposed to be kind of an edgy show for housewives.  Is it?  For housewives, sure.  Edgy.  It's a lot different than 2020 or any of those other crappy shows, right?  But she doesn't understand.  I'm going to use edgy, though.  It's edgy for housewives.  Edgy is a tapered tampon.  Not much of an edge. 
[01:10:30]  You guys going to get beeped?  Ow.  Ow.  What did you think of that one?  Ow.  Was that okay?  Was that FCC friendly?  Ow.  Okay, Peeky.  Something about tapered, just.  Yeah.  That's way harder than the other words.  Yeah, it's just tapered.  All right, here's more drunk Denny DeVito.  I've all seen him in that little waste paper basket next to the toilet.  They're not tapered when they're done, are they?  Fat red beach balls. 
[01:11:00]  Ew, it's blood he's talking about.  There you go.  Ew, beep it.  Yeah, well, he did now, Joe.  Thanks.  You just did a loss on us.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's impossible to, a body fluid, but I could say I have a bloody nose.  Yeah, of course.  But now that you said that, that's dumb too, because.  A bloody nose?  Yeah, stop.  Really?  No, you can say that.  I know how he works, though.  Yeah, but you can say that.  Now saying that brings us back to what, wow, we're trying to get away with.  No, but that's so, that's so innocent.  This is making my, that's fine. 
[01:11:30]  You know what?  So is the other thing, because there was no, no, no placement mentioned.  No, nothing mentioned.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think everything's fine.  It's good.  All right.  Let's, I think we're good here.  Yeah.  Let's get back to drunk Danny DeVito on The View.  I would ask about your house.  You have a 25th wedding anniversary.  Yeah, I do.  But let me give it to, I give it to, the White House was like, the White House was like, great.  You get the Lincoln bedroom.  Yeah.  It's a Lincoln, yes.  You did?  You slept there?  Slept in the Lincoln bedroom with Ria. 
[01:12:00]  No way.  Yes, we got there.  We went in and we made it our business.  Good.  This is gross.  To really wreck the joint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, every place in that bedroom was utilized.  Utilized.  There you go, Danny.  Utilized.  That's the word.  That's a lie.  That's a hell of a visual.  He's not banging her anymore.  That's a lie.  No way.  No way.  I bet they did it once.  You think so?  Yeah.  In the Lincoln bedroom? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  You would have to.  But not every place in there.  Really?  Yeah, I think you'd have to.  No way he gets it.  Just to say you did.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I would think it would be filmed.  Who knew that Ria was a three-candle girl?  But now, how come people aren't going to jump on him, or are they, about disrespecting the White House?  Well, his wife.  Yeah, well, that's true.  That's for God.  Yeah, but the Lincoln bedroom.  A lot of people are mad at Lincoln for that decision.  Are they? 
[01:13:00]  I figured he might as well do it in Lincoln's bedroom.  That's what Lincoln did to the country.  Oh, my goodness.  And R is the amazing Ria.  Yeah, there you go.  So far, not that bad, though, right?  No, you can hear him slurring.  You can definitely hear him slurring.  He's just having a good time.  It's more interesting than the usual dumb celebrity interview.  I think their idea of drunk is a lot different than ours. 
[01:13:30]  He looked like he was two hours sober, too.  He hadn't had anything for a couple hours, and he was coming up.  No, no.  Steve-O on, what was it, Corolla?  Yeah.  Corolla's show.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that was drunk and drugged out or whatever it was.  That was.  I might have the clip.  I'll strangle you.  Like, he's threatening his life in one breath and then saying how much he loves him in another,  and he meant it.  Like, that's how gone he was.  Could you see, like, that type of drunk on The View?  How great would have been to get the Mel Gibson tape? 
[01:14:00]  How awesome would that have been?  Of him getting arrested with all the slurping.  It's somewhere.  Screaming at the Jews.  It's somewhere.  That must have been so good.  It's somewhere.  Someone's got it.  It's got to get on YouTube.  He will pay a million or more dollars to get that destroyed.  More than a million, man.  And even Lucas couldn't get rid of the Christmas special, the Star Wars Christmas special.  He tried.  It's still out there.  Here's the Steve-O clip in.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness. 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  That's drunk.  Now, that's hammered.  Denny DeVito just had, you know.  A couple of drinks.  A couple of drinks.  This is drunk.  The night before.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  Consciousness.  That sounds like Tippy Tom.  Steve-O is the real deal, man.  Absolutely.  Doesn't he have all of Angelina Jolie's tattoos?  Like when she gets one, he gets the same tattoo.  Does he really?  Yes.  Steve-O's a funny guy.  He's a weird guy. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, he is.  That was the funniest thing I've ever heard.  He's got Billy Bob tattooed on his arm.  The whole deal.  The Thai Buddha stuff on his back.  One of the best was when they were off-roading and he was getting the tattoo of a happy face  on his arm and it just came out like a blob.  Because they were going over whoop-dee-doos and bumps in a four-wheel drive vehicle as  he was getting the tattoo.  Yeah, with Henry Rollins driving.  Yeah, Henry Rollins driving.  It was just a wreck on his arm.  All right.  More Danny DeVito audio.  So far, who cares? 
[01:15:30]  He is, his two daughters see that he cannot see his house.  He's the only one on the block.  Okay.  Here he is describing his new movie.  Now, Barbara, here's what happened.  He really started bashing Bush and talking about having sex in the White House.  And I think Barbara saw that that was going to be controversial.  Like people are going to go, hey, this guy's disrespecting the White House or whatever.  Barbara immediately changed gears and goes, why don't we talk about your movie? 
[01:16:00]  Like chops him off.  Talk about your movie.  So he starts talking about the movie and just, I think he started at the credits and  wanted to end at the end credits and talk about the entire movie.  He didn't shut up.  Just babbling like me right now.  You were so into it too.  Nice setup.  There was a point in there somewhere.  Yeah.  Try to find it.  His two daughters see that he cannot see. 
[01:16:30]  His house is the only one on the block.  He can't see from space.  You know how you can look at the thing?  Google Earth.  That's right.  Yeah, you look at it.  Yeah.  And he sees the neighbor's house.  Matthew Broderick.  Yeah.  It's all like really nice and white and this and that.  My house looks like it's like, you know, ugly.  Yeah.  So I get an idea to put, and it's Christmas time, you know, holiday season.  I get the idea to put the lights on and I put every available light from the town, from 
[01:17:00]  the next town, the next town.  I find horses.  I put them in front of the house.  Oh, don't tell them the whole movie.  Don't tell them the whole movie.  Don't tell them the whole movie.  Because they're all everybody.  Yeah.  You want them to see it.  Yeah.  He's giving away the big secret.  Yeah.  You mean the crazy Christmas movie where the neighbors fight and the lights go on?  Ooh.  Sounds good.  Don't tell the whole movie.  You're giving away the secret.  I bet at the end they get together and everything's fine.  It's true.  I bet it works out well.  Yeah.  They realize the spirit of Christmas is what it's all about and blech. 
[01:17:30]  Either that or maybe Santa's arrested in a crib doing something he shouldn't be doing.  When was the last time a movie threw you a real curveball?  Sixth Sense?  No.  I think it was that boxing movie with the chick.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who knew it was a comedy?  You know what?  That threw me a curve.  The Departed kind of.  That was kind of a curveball.  I'm not going to blow it, but the end was kind of a curveball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With all standing around the cracker and Nicholson wins?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Cracker.  I went up to your old school.  What, Rich Voss?  That golf movie.  The Greatest Game Ever Played.  I never really thought the amateur would win.  Why?  Wow.  Why?  If you saw the movie, you would understand.  If you saw the movie, you would understand.  You're the only person that saw that movie.  And I love golf, too.  Well, I'm just saying.  It's gotten to a point where I can't go see an action movie or something like Batman.  When they're headed towards the cliff and you know he's going to catch himself before he falls off the cliff. 
[01:18:30]  It's just insulting.  At this point, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's like, come on.  Yeah, everything's been pretty much done in action movies.  There's no suspense.  There's no suspense at all.  I know he's going to be fine.  I'm not even worried a little.  I had an argument with our Bonnie.  We went and saw James Bond.  I go, it's not enough action in this movie.  And she said it was.  It was an action movie.  But it wasn't real good action to me.  Did you see it?  I have not seen the Bond movie.  You guys argued over James Bond?  It's over, dude.  It's done.  That's all they're doing now is nagging and ragging each other. 
[01:19:00]  You're like Pam Anderson and Kid Rock.  Yeah.  You just find stuff to be hateful for.  About little things.  It's Pam Anderson and Dumb as a Rock.  That's what you guys talk about now?  What else?  This popcorn's too salty.  No, it isn't.  Shut up, bitch.  I liked his clothes.  I didn't think they were good at all.  I don't know.  The big fight happens when I go, no, Sarah's funny.  That's her.  Oh.  Did I think Sarah Silverman?  Oh, boy.  She didn't like her, really?  No, it's just, you know, comedy. 
[01:19:30]  Good for her.  Female comic.  She doesn't think Sarah's funny?  She thinks that she's the only funny comic, like every female comic.  Very good.  She thinks she's the only funny one.  Well, there's only, like, two that are funny, right?  That's a grind, man.  Yeah.  So was the Bond movie good?  It was all right.  To me, it wasn't a lot of action, like, the Bond movie.  Where'd they have all that stupid dialogue and stuff?  The dude looks like a killer.  That guy looks like a killer.  Yeah, yeah.  Pierce Brosnan.  Who's that guy killing?  He looks like he should be doing some UFC, right?  Yeah, that guy looks like he's got scars on his face. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, either one of those.  It's the worst.  Sean Connery's always the best.  Connery was great.  And then this guy, yeah, just seems to make a pretty good Bond.  He looks right.  And I like the idea that they, you know, updated it, threw away all the old ones, and kind  of just put him like, this is him becoming James Bond.  Yeah, that's a cool idea.  That's kind of a good idea instead of just throwing another.  That's a new thing in Hollywood, too.  They did that with the Batman movie.  Yeah, Batman begins that one.  Superman.  Superman, they kind of did it.  How many times can they rehash the same crap?  It's just amazing how few ideas there are out there. 
[01:20:30]  Bring back Tank Girl.  Tank Girl, you like that one, huh?  Yeah.  Laurie Petty.  I'll tell you one thing I can't get enough of, although they use the same stuff over  and over, but they kind of do a good job of it in some movies.  Those goddamn zombies.  I love zombie movies.  Zombie movies are fun.  I had a zombie dream the other night.  It was the remake where the Ving Rhames was in it and stuff.  Was that Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, the other one, the other.  That was a pretty good movie.  Best one was 28 Days Later.  Yeah.  That was a good one. 
[01:21:00]  You had no idea what's happening, too?  Yeah.  And they made that movie for like 50 bucks.  And when they can run, they've had a whole new dimension to zombies.  I don't care.  Zombie, I don't care.  If you could outrun them, I'm fine.  Right.  I'm fine.  You could sit there and taunt them.  Have fun with them.  Like Shaun of the Dead.  Shaun of the Dead.  Yeah.  28 Days Later, they're sprinting.  They're called running at you.  Yeah, with blood splattering out of their mouths.  Nothing scarier than running zombie. 
[01:21:30]  There you go.  There's something different.  It was a good...  Did you see it?  28 Days Later?  No, no.  It was a disease.  I'm going to write it down.  I'm going to check it out now.  These animal rights activists break into this chimpanzee research center, and they've  got some crazy disease they're testing.  Yeah.  Some...  On...  On chimps.  On chimps, yeah.  And it gets out, and just...  This guy gets hit by a car, and he wakes up 28 days later from a coma.  He doesn't even know.  The whole world is gone.  And it's all just...  Yeah.  Everyone's infected with this disease.  Nice.  Awesome.  Yeah, really good movie.  It's a scary movie.  I'm actually doing a movie where it's me and a girl, and we're assassins, and we have 
[01:22:00]  to go save the president and get the computer disks.  Those female assassins are awesome.  When they do the spin kicks in their high heels.  Yeah.  Yeah, who saw that coming?  No, that one.  Gina Davis was in the bear with her...  She makes a great president.  With her and Sam Jackson?  Yeah.  If one more action star jumps out a window and does that matrix landing, where they put  the leg out, one leg goes out, and the arm, stop with the matrix landing. 
[01:22:30]  Do you do that in your action movie, Jim?  Yeah, we have a whole scene, though, where we're saying funny things to each other while  we're fighting, like while we cook dinner.  Or, you know, it's going to be like a really good fight scene and stuff, where she bails  me out, and we've got to get the computer disk for the president to be saved.  I don't want to give it away.  It's good.  Micro film.  Yeah, rush them to get them.  Yeah.  It's like a love scene.  A love scene where you find me sleeping with her.  At the end, I realize she's a man.  I accept it. 
[01:23:00]  Accept it.  She's hot.  Just don't tell anybody.  Yeah, she puts a chin print in my back.  Here's the last...  So it's a documentary?  Here's the last clip of Danny DeVito on The View.  Honey, read that.  Read that right there.  Just read this, Danny.  Read it.  Our thanks to Danny DeVito.  Go ahead.  Danny DeVito, Decto Halls, is in theaters now.  We'll be right back with Thomas Gibson.  Thomas Gibson.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  Make him read the cue cards.  It wasn't bad at all. 
[01:23:30]  No, but on The View's version of the world, he's the drunkest guy ever.  Right.  Yeah.  In that toned-down version of America.  It's a totally different world in that studio at that moment.  You know what he was actually doing three hours before?  The drugs and the hookers.  He was boozing with George Clooney to you guys.  They just had a couple of drinks.  They just had a few, two men, and lemon, what is it?  Lemon cello.  It's a lemon liqueur.  Who the hell drinks that?  All the people watching, if you're a bunch of middle-aged ladies at home drinking and doing Valiums anyhow, 
[01:24:00]  they're all drunk.  You know what I mean?  You think?  And they're hot.  I didn't know that, Rich.  Rich, what are you saying?  Yeah, that was a good observation that we could have played all of them.  It could be my mom watching that show, dude.  My mom's not drunk.  Yeah, man, chill.  You calling Joe Rogan's mom drunk?  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe the Valiums.  Chill.  I'm so angry.  All the Way May doesn't do Valium.  What's that?  All the Way May doesn't do Valium.  All the Way May.  His great-great-aunt is actually All the Way May.  Oh, the one from the League of Their Own.  I heard you talking about it.  The whore from League of Their Own.  Yeah.  The three-holer.  Madonna played my great-aunt. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  In League of Their Own.  For real?  Yeah.  And Madonna wasn't able to whore it up as much as the real one did.  All right, all right.  She's a nun now in her 90s, and all we do is talk about All the Way May and how she got  that name.  That's probably why the boys were off fighting the war and the Negro League popped in.  And they caught All the Way May.  Listen.  The Negro League.  Every one of them wound up getting the pink glove.  Good old All the Way May.  Looks like I'm staying home this Christmas. 
[01:25:00]  Not going to the relative's house this year because I have to hear it from some of the  people in my family that don't like the radio show.  Why does the clubhouse smell like blood and coffee?  All right.  It smells like pennies in here.  All the Way May was on the bench.  I found a picture of All the Way May.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  Oh, from the old days?  From the Post.  When she was a goer?  From the Post.  Yeah, I think they do have a picture of her as a goer.  I remember years ago, there was a girl named All the Way May.  Me and a whole team.  That didn't get enough laughs. 
[01:25:30]  Pennies?  Thank you.  Yeah, pennies.  Oh, they're laughing out there, though.  That's...  Oh, yeah.  We're going to do that.  Hey, Jet's going to still join the program.  We've got Rich Voss playing Governors this weekend.  Yep.  Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday.  We've got Joe Rogan playing Carolines this weekend here in New York City.  Can I do Sunday?  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Oh, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  And Ari, the Amazing Racist will be warming up for Joe Rogan, right?  Holla.  Warming up.  And Steve will be standing there in an effeminate manner.  All right.  Leading against the wall.  Yeah.  You're not going to believe what this leukemia kid is doing. 
[01:26:00]  Dying?  Is that a tease?  You're dying?  This is a terrific...  Oh, Jimmy.  I guess.  Good guess, but...  He has come up with a way to raise some money.  All right.

[01:27:00]  Very, very busy morning today.  Rich Voss in studio, Joe Rogan in studio, the amazing racist in studio.  And I'm looking at Jed right behind you, Anthony.  Yep.  I love Jed.  How are you guys?  Good.  They're men of their word, by the way.  Yeah.  Or men of their words.  Because you guys were supposed to come in over the summer?  Yes.  We thought we were getting the big blow-off? 
[01:27:30]  Is the mic on for him?  I got sick.  I got laryngitis.  Yeah.  Well, we've heard, you know, Ant and I have been doing radio and Jimmy for a very long time,  and no offense to you guys, we've heard those excuses from bands and stuff.  So we're like, oh, God, here comes the big blow-off.  The lead singer's sick.  And Steve's like, no, he really is sick.  He's got a real problem, and they're promising they're going to come back, and here you are.  So, bravo.  What was the problem?  Man of our words.  Man of our words.  What was the problem, though?  You had a throat thing going on?  I had laryngitis, and then it developed into throat nodules, which we ended up having to 
[01:28:00]  cancel about three weeks.  Ow.  How does one get throat nodules?  It's like calluses.  You get a callus on your vocal cords.  Jimmy?  From over work.  Now, do you get rid of them?  There's a couple ways to get rid of them.  One is you can have them surgically removed or lasered.  One is you could just not talk for six months, and they go away, right?  Isn't that a way to do it, too?  I caught them early on, and I just had to not talk for a few days, and I had to steam 
[01:28:30]  my voice every day, like a few hours a day.  Yeah, your singing style definitely is like rough on the throat, right?  Yeah, it's pretty just annoying, you know?  Yeah.  You've got to stop smoking and stop drinking and stop eating spicy foods and pretty much  everything that...  All the joys of life.  It was most frustrating because it was all happening at the very beginning of the second  album, kind of like the tour and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, the timing was bad for you guys. 
[01:29:00]  It was so long.  You guys had that massive debut, massive, and then the second CD's called Shine On, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, right on.  And you guys, you want to play the single from Shine On, or...?  Well, we're going to do three songs, is that right?  All right.  What do you want to do first?  We're going to kick it off with the oldie but goldie.  How you remember, girl?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, we got it, huh?  Yeah, we segue into the music very easily here, like a freight train. 
[01:29:30]  All the silence starts.  Whenever you're ready.  One, two, three. 
[01:30:00]  You say, my hand will come with me because you look so fine that I really want to make  you mine.  I say, you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.  Four or five sales, come on and get your kicks.  Now, you don't need money when you look like that, do you, honey?  Little black boots, long brown hair.

[01:31:00]  One, two, three.  Say, my hand will come with me because you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.  Yeah, I say, you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.  Four or five sales, come on and get your kicks.  Now, you don't need money with a face like that.  You don't need money with a face like that.

[01:44:30]  Here's a corny, awful question  Biggest influence  So many  The Wiggles  I would guess  The Wiggles  Grey Wiggle  Grey Wiggle  Got some Wiggle fans  I think the Beatles  The Beatles have to honestly be  We hear a little Beatles in there  Certainly  You just can't deny how brilliant they were  Every single band's influenced by the Beatles  Either directly or indirectly  Whether or not they're aware of it  They are  You know, even 
[01:45:00]  I was  MSNBC recently  Whoever wrote that article  Should really have his feet cut off  So yes, Pantera  No Beatles  It said that Sabbath should not be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  I had to throw that out there  So whoever you are for MSNBC  I hope you die  All right, we've got to take a break  We want to thank Jet for stopping by  It's  Great job  Jetband.com  Jettheband  Jettheband.com for tour dates, okay?

Welcome aboard  Alright, snuggles  Did you guys finally get your ass together with that board over there?  Or is Jet just that good?  Because that sounded phenomenal  It did sound good  That's what happens when you have such a screw-up with the last band that came in 
[01:47:00]  That we made sure that the equipment was here the night before  Everything was pre-checked  Like what we like to call a real radio show  Yeah, that really did sound like a real radio show  I'm very, very impressed  All right  Picture of the board or something  Good job, guys  Yeah, we're getting there  I don't listen to jazz  I don't know their music  And, of course, I recognize the song they did  They were really good, man  The first album was a monster  I like the new stuff, too  They had like three or four massive hits on the first album  I don't know how that guy sings more than one night in a row  Yeah, crazy, huh?  Holy Jesus 
[01:47:30]  He just rips it apart  That's like blood should be spurting out of your throat  That song's great, though  Yeah, it really is  That shine was a romantic number  I hate to agree with Hope on that one  That was good  Holding hands on my girl, pecking her cheek  Well, Jimmy looked at me  Pecking her cheek  Jimmy looked at me weird  But it was like one of those pallet  Power ballads  And I'm looking around the room like  This is a little weird  It's like 20 guys  It's a soft side  20 guys listening to a power ballad  You know he wrote that thinking  This is going to get me laid  Oh, yeah  You know he wrote it going  And it does  This is going to work  This one's going to work 
[01:48:00]  Those guys up there must just get so many girls  It's disgusting  How many girls could you turn down  I'm desperately working on a song call  I was kidding  I don't have AIDS  It's just a joke  He looks like Luther from 48 Hours, that guy  They're very three handsome young Aussies  With the accents and the tight flax meeting girls  How filthy and depressing is that  My awful disgusting act  They're kind of tiny though  Yeah, we're living in the line  They're tiny guys 
[01:48:30]  It's amazing how much chicks love guys in bands  There was some guys  I don't know who they were  There were some guys on a plane with us  They had tattoos in their neck  They were obviously rock guys  Lip rings and stuff  And this one girl would non-stop hitting on them  The whole time, the whole flight  She just turned around in her seat  Just yapping at them  And she was cute, man  Yeah, guys in bands  What band was it?  You know  No idea  That's what was happening at first class  And coach, I sat down next to a guy with cottage cheese  They made a very bad analogy 
[01:49:00]  They said being in a band is like being a girl with big breasts  Now, being in a band is like being a guy with a gun  The world is your oyster  They are walking roofies  Yeah  Zip it and they will come  Hey, we got a great story to get to here  Listen to this one  A boy from Florida with cancer  Is very much easier  That wasn't the funny part, Jimmy  Jimmy  Cancer's not funny  A boy from Florida with cancer 
[01:49:30]  Is very much easier  Jimmy  What?  No  A boy from Florida  My health doesn't allow it  I see where this is going  I actually am going to probably feel guilty sooner  Because I don't  I'm going to hear how old he is first  Yeah  A boy from Florida with cancer  Is very much using his head  Pat Pedraja lost all of his hair  Following chemotherapy  So the very inventive 11-year-old 
[01:50:00]  Decided to offer up advertising space on his head on eBay  For $5,000  You can lease space on a quarter of his head for three months  It will not only help you by advertisement  It will also help save a bunch of lives  You see, all of the money Pat raises  Will go to the bone marrow banks  To help leukemia patients just like him  Talk about a great kid  Hopefully you can help him out  Alright, get this kid on the phone  Wow logo on his head  You want a wow logo, five grand?  An Opie and Anthony wow logo on his head  Where does he go, though? 
[01:50:30]  Does he just stay at home?  Yeah  No, who sees him?  Who's going to say  How much do you pay?  What street are you taking?  Come on  $5,000 worth of advertising  So some fat nurse can look at your head  Get out in the mall, sick boy  You want to ball games?  We don't need to advertise to grandma  She's bringing you your soup  Exactly  That's great  Who's going to see a wow sticker?  A mortician  Get him drunk on the wall  Hey, sorry  Hey  Whoa, is that over the line?  He's not dead  I'm not the one putting ads on the kid's head  It's probably his father 
[01:51:00]  Who needs money to gamble  He already did  And he lost  It's great  I love how Jimmy turned around  And the  Yeah, I got to screw you  That's what he does on stage  You just got a bunch of  Oohs  And reacted just like you do on stage  What do you think is going to happen to the kid?  He's got leukemia  He's selling ad space on his skull  How do I react?  How adorable  A little punk  Smack his face  Straighten him out  Can you imagine the guy that puts the ad on his head the day before he passes 
[01:51:30]  And he tries to get his money back?  You know  I was supposed to get a three month run on this  Contractually there has to be a stipulation  Look, if he falls down before February 8th  I get half my money back  I bet he could get more money if he had some sort of a contest  See if he can come up with more money to keep them from putting advertisements on his head  My poor son, we're going to have to write on his head  Yeah, look, we got to write on this poor kid's head because we're poor  Yeah, we need money for him  He's sick  Ten grand can keep his head clean  Usually if people just go on the news like this, they get money 
[01:52:00]  Yeah  Like I was a sucker for that god damn stupid little pudding head girl that got her wheelchair stolen  Oh, that's right, you donated  I remember that one  I felt so bad  I went home and I found out the address to send money to  And I sent money  What was the story again?  Oh, little pudding head girl  She was in a wheelchair  You know, she was wheelchair bound  I think she had a brain tumor  That's what it was 
[01:52:30]  She had a special van that was stolen?  She had a special van and the wheelchair was in it and everything got stolen  So why didn't you buy her the van?  And they needed money  How do you know I didn't?  Did you?  I cut him a nice check, put it that way  Oh, that's great  And let me tell you something  I never heard word one back  Really?  Thank you?  I got nothing back  Not only did I not send anything  But I wrote a letter that said, ha ha  That's what you get  Show off  Show off  Show off  That's what you get 
[01:53:00]  Miss, it's all about me  I got a special van and the bed that comes up  They didn't give you a letter back, yeah?  Uh, no  I know your donation was pretty hefty  What about the joy in your heart?  That's what it's all about  Yeah  Really?  It's just about, you know, doing something nice for somebody  I wasn't looking for any  I'm going to let it back from the parents  Hey, thank you  I wasn't looking for that  I would have been  I kind of expected it  But I wasn't looking  Please repossess the van  Please sue them to get the van back 
[01:53:30]  They've tangled them up in courts for years  They can't drive it  It's so funny when people get charity  And then they don't respond to it the right way  And everybody freaks out  Like that family in New Orleans  Yep, yep  That $75,000 house  $75,000 house  Which is amazing that you can get a house for 75 grand, by the way  75, geez  And it was a nice house  It was like a real nice house  Over here it would be like a crap hole  Yeah  It would be garbage  But there it was really nice  And the church gave it to this family  Because they were homeless  Because of Katrina  And they turned around 
[01:54:00]  And immediately sold it  Never moved in  For a profit  Never moved in  Took the money and ran  And then I think what was bad  Was their little interview  They had on the news  Because of course  One of those  Shame, shame, shame on you reporters  Ran after them  Yeah  And was asking the wife  What happened  And she explained  And it's just  They didn't come off looking  The husband was the best  The husband was the best  Take it up with God  Take it up with God  Actually guys  We got the story  Oh you got it  It's so weird that Joe went there  Thank you Joe  Oh this one was great  I watched this  Like three times  I couldn't believe 
[01:54:30]  The husband was this stupid  Yeah listen to this  We've been telling you  About a New Orleans family  Displaced by Hurricane Katrina  In February  The Temple of Deliverance  Church of God in Christ  Gave them the keys  To a house in Hickory Hill  That church members say  The wife selected  A $75,000 house  Free and clear  But we discovered  The family sold it  Without ever moving in  What is this darn food  Dolores Thompson and her family  Were selected  Out of more than  50 Hurricane Katrina families  My house  To be the recipients  Of this $75,000 house 
[01:55:00]  So why did they never move in  And why did they sell it  When we called Thompson  She admitted she had not moved in  But told us she still owned the house  She hung up  When asked if she had sold it  Bravo man  They need the money  Bravo  Yes  They need the money  These two were  Characters  Shysters  I wonder how they picked them  Because I mean  How many people lost their house  I know  What was the criteria 
[01:55:30]  Probably  Being a scumbag  A raffle or something  Or a drawing  I think there's a couple  They probably said  They had a story  Or something like that  And they were trying  To get married  I don't know  Take it up with God  That's what the guy  Kept saying  When we were interviewing him  Take it up with God  He just wanted air time too  Like he was all  Heavy smiles  Like let me talk  I want to be on the camera  He was a fairly smooth character  She and her husband  Agree to meet us at the house  When they arrived  She told us  Death in her family  And personal problems  Kept her from moving in  I was in need of a house  But at the time 
[01:56:00]  That I was in need of a house  I didn't get the house  And so once I got the house  I really don't like this area  I really didn't  And I didn't know anybody  So that's why  I didn't move in  And I sold it  She eventually told us  She made $60,000 off the sale  But that's not what the deed shows  Well according to this document  That I have  You sold the house  For $88,000  Which means you made a  No I didn't sell it  For $88,000  I sold it for $60,000  The people who sold it  Got the rest of the money  Some commission  Wow  Who the hell's getting 
[01:56:30]  The difference  $28,000 on $60,000  On $60,000  I don't think so  Maybe they're just not  I mean not that she doesn't  Sound like the most  Financially savvy woman  I like how she starts off  Saying like  Well at the time  I did need it  And then when I got it  Well I didn't need it anymore  I didn't need it anymore  I didn't know anybody there  The bottom line  On this whole thing  Is there is probably  A family  That really needed the house  That would have moved in  And  Loved it  Yeah  Loved having that house  You know  You know where the happy people are 
[01:57:00]  The neighbors  I saw the neighborhood  Yeah the neighbors  Bought the house  They shipped in  They were nailing together  Some crosses  In that neighborhood  That's why she sold it for $60  Because as soon as she moved in  It was worth $15,000  Here we go  Hey here's the clip  Joe Rogan was talking about  The husband wants to be on camera  Yeah  Listen to this  Make it up so you can give me two  I want to be on camera  I want to be on camera too  The husband's loss  No ask me a question  The way it appears 
[01:57:30]  Is that a house  Ask me  A church  The way it appears  I'll take it over here  There's a lot of chicanery  Conniveness  Deceit  Deception  Devisiveness  Trickery  Going on  On whose part  Because the church gave you  A free house  The church gave you  A free house  And you all never move in  Anything  That was church people  Who out of their generosity  Paid for this house  Take it up with God  Take it up with God  You gotta love that kind of arrogance  I love that too 
[01:58:00]  It's chicanery  The guy says  On whose part  He goes  The church  Oh the church that gave you  A free house  That dude is right out of  Pimps up hoes down  Oh yeah  You ain't telling me nothing  Street corner  You know  Street corner  Yes  You gotta make your next move  To the right move  Choose a pimp tonight baby  It's chicanery  Divisiveness  Divisiveness  Divisiveness  It's chicanery  That's brilliant  He was standing there  With a big brim  And a cane  Yeah  Yeah  Crunk cup  Take it up with God  Take it up with God 
[01:58:30]  Turned out  Jesus  Take it up with God  Take it up with God  Here's how the story ends  We took it up with God  God had no comment  And God said  Better there  Than in my neighborhood  Back to you  Chip  The interview ended  With the Thompsons  Speeding away  I don't like the area  You don't like the area  But I don't understand  Dolores  The ITV on public record  Showing the family  Previously had a New Orleans address 
[01:59:00]  And while the church  Never told them  They couldn't sell the house  They say they would have  Never given it to them  Had they known  They were not going to move in  If you are not the most needed  You should decline  You know  There are monies  That have been given  Churches been given  There are houses  And there are still people  Out there  Without houses  And they haven't  It's a hard  Chip on them  Don't accept the gift  If you don't need it  If you don't need it  We took it up with God  And he said  I quote  Next time  I'll drown all the 
[01:59:30]  How can you speed away  On a bus  Take it up with God  They sped away in a car  Donated to them  By a white man  With his head cracked open  On the curb  They sped away in a van  They sped away in a van  With a wheelchair  In it  Yeah  That's pretty clever  Callback  I like the callback  Let's go to Steve  On Long Island  Steve what's up 
[02:00:00]  Hey what's up guys  Hey Steve  Yeah you know what  They should advertise  On that kid's head  Yeah  Well at least  I don't have AIDS  And he gives a frankus  Hey when that kid  When you're advertising  On his head  Does his father say  Hey look  If we don't give him  The medication  Will his head swell up  So we can put some  More advertising  Yeah as the money  Pours in  They try to give him  Medicine  It just makes his head  Real big  They do what those  Crazy dudes do  Their testicles  Where they inflate 
[02:00:30]  Them with saline  Oh yeah  They get him  Just pump him up  They keep feeding him  Radiation so hair  Doesn't cover up  The head space  Oh there's the kid  There's a picture  Of the kid  That's him  Look at him  Oh god  Tussle his little scalp  Yeah  The little sign  Says if you lived here  You'd be home right now  So for five grand  There's a bullseye  On the back of his head  For five grand  You could put anything  On his head  I'm seeing the limits  What do you think  To sue him  Whackbag.com  Yeah I think  We should buy some space 
[02:01:00]  I think that if we're  Not on the phone  We should buy his whole head  How many spaces  Do you have for rent  And Opie and Anthony  Should buy his whole head  Does he have a contact  Let's talk to this kid  Let's see what we can  Get on his head  Why not  Yeah why not  Absolutely  I guess the most lucrative  Part of his head  Would be the front  That way at least  Friends and family  Will see it  If the worst happens  Yeah he's laying backwards  And again if it's on the back  What do you need  One uncle  Seeing your head  Oh  Imagine if Rocky Dennis 
[02:01:30]  Had that disease  They would have been millionaires  Oh tattoo on the back  Silk pillow here  All right  Hey what do we got  On Snoop Dogg there  Snoop Dogg was arrested again  Yeah he just can't stop  Getting arrested  He's addicted to it  And Suge is really pissed man  This is really good  Snoop got arrested after Leno  Why is Suge mad?  He called him a police informant  Called him a police informant  He said he's never seen a guy 
[02:02:00]  That's been arrested so many times  Not serve any time  He gets off like every time  So now Suge's like  He's a rat  Called him a rat  And a police informant  When Suge calls you that  Not good  That guy scares me  Yeah  He's scary  Suge's not big on the negotiating  No  No  Isn't he out  He's out right?  Yeah  How's that work?  Let's explain that  How's that work?  You ever read that Rolling Stone article  On Biggie and Tupac 
[02:02:30]  And the murders  Oh yeah  Pretty much  Just about implicates him  In the whole thing  Pretty much  Yeah just about  Spells out who was working for him  That those guys were cops  And they were dirty cops  Yeah  They were employed by him  And it links their car  To the actual shooting  And just the fact that  There's been no  Headway in that investigation  In years  Not one word  Of what happened  Yeah  To either of them  You know  Do you know  I was doing the Saga show in Vegas  And there was a rumor  That Shug was coming to our show  He's a Jeff Ross fan

[02:03:30]  Pat Cooper the comic  Oh I don't know  You west coast bitch  I know  I live three blocks away from you  What are you talking about  You gotta hear us  You gotta hear Snoop Dogg's lawyer  In this latest one  The 35 year old entertainer  Convicted felon  With alleged gang ties  Who's his lawyer  Alleged  Yeah exactly  Has been arrested three times  Since September  On various drug and weapon charges  Let the guy carry a weapon  I mean  If somebody  Has the right to carry a weapon  It's Snoop  At least give him  A friggin fighting chance 
[02:04:00]  That was  Latest arrest  Was for felony gun  And drug charges  Okay  His attorney says  Cops are yanking  The dog's chain  For some reason  Snoop is under the microscope  These days  It wasn't like  They arrested him  For having tinted windows  Yeah  You know  You have illegal tint sir  Under the microscope  I don't know  He wears blue all the time  And throws up a W  Whenever you take a picture of him  I don't know why  They look at him  Or is that an M  Cause he's from Montauk  And he turned your daughter out  On spring break  Yanking the dog's chain 
[02:04:30]  Is that a New York Post cover  Yeah  It's hilarious  Daily news  That doesn't sound quite like  Lawyer jargon either  No  Yanking the dog's chain  What's the lawyer's name  Did they say  Something Stein  Yeah  I want to see what his  Lawyer's name is  Donald Etra  E-T-R-A  Anthony  Your pal talk girl's got a gun now  Oh good  Whoa  This might be  She's put it in her mouth  Whoa  What the hell is going on  Nice  This is my rifle  This is my bunt  Imagine  Has anyone ever committed suicide

[02:14:00]  We can fix everything  Oh not because of us  Some guy  Oh some guy just took a bunch of stuff and ran off?  So what did he look like?  Black  What did he look like?  Black guy  He was a black guy  My god what a surprise  Well sir you know what?  We're going to drum up some business  Well how much did he take?  Yeah how much in a magazine?  How much did he take?  That's about $15-$20  Did he take black engines?  I'll give you $20  Alright listen  Wow look at this one sir  Dick James show me your weapon  I think the fun thing about black penises is the discoloration of the tip  Am I right or wrong? 
[02:14:30]  Opie just paid him off $20  That's how he rolls  It looks like two different cocks  Now that's photoshopped  Now you feel a little better today  Look he's smiling again  It looks like it broke and then it was repaired  What happened?  It takes a little left turn there  Two different cocks  Dick James  Like some bitch beat it off  Show me your weapon  And they had to put a white man's dick on the tip  Or it's so big  Yeah it's like  Why is it so dark here and then so light there?  His dick grew out of the color  Hold on a second now  Let's go the other way 
[02:15:00]  He looks like an older gentleman in the face  Comedian named Greer Barnes  Oh look at this one  I like the hair  Look at the size of that cock  I like the hair on him  And what buttocks  See we just come  Wowie  Whoa whoa whoa whoa  Miguel and Andre  Oh god  Those are two  That's two black guys fucking each other in the ass  You don't see that every day  Look at that sir  He's real  That's called teaching a lesson  Yeah  And it's right above a picture of John Travolta kissing a guy in the Enquirer  Oh yeah  You know to see crisscross have to go to that point in their careers  They love each other 
[02:15:30]  Sir I don't know if this is Miguel or Andre  But he has baby boy tattooed on his back  Oh yeah  Who doesn't want to see that when they're making love?  How many guys have read that?  I'm sure quite a few  Hey wow what is this Travolta thing?  Yeah why is Travolta kissing a guy?  I don't know I think that's one of those  They caught it at the right moment  How great is it?  Because it's who's gay and who's not  And they got Travolta kissing a guy  They got him without his wig  And obviously he's not  Travolta's not gay there  But that'll get you to buy the magazine  You don't think he's gay?  You think Travolta's gay? 
[02:16:00]  Oh yeah for sure  I think like I think Rogan is tough  Yes  He is  Yeah  How do you know?  Well I met him  Uh oh  Yeah  I mean he never didn't hit on me or anything  But my gaydar with my butthole clamped shut  He's a Scientologist man  I mean there's only two reasons to be Scientologist  You're retarded or you're gay  Well there you go  You heard it here first  And you know the whole dancing thing  He's always been very good at it  Well it's a great  It's a great gang to have  Like they look out for you  Yeah  As far as like a cult 
[02:16:30]  That's like one of the best cults to join  Yeah  I thought about joining  I'm like they'll take care of your career  What do you got Jimmy?  He doesn't have his wig  True  Travolta does not have his wig  Why does he wear a wig?  Look at that head  It's hard to tell  They've shown pictures  They have really up close pictures  Where you see that mesh  That's kind of on the side of his head  Where they weld on the hair or something  Chuck Norris has got the best one  Does he?  No one's got a better one than Chuck  Norris  The best thing about Chuck  Is there was no pictures of him going bald  It's like full head of hair  Full head of hair  But what's going on?  You know  It's like 
[02:17:00]  A little something funky happened to it  You know who finally got that  Hair piece thing down?  No  Shatner  Oh his is beautiful  Shatner now  No it's not like that big  Because there was one point  Where Shatner had  The most hair I've ever seen  On someone's head  On his head  Oh he used to have a crazy one  Yeah  He went like the whole way  If I'm going to go bald  I want more hair  Dumped on my head  Than I've ever seen on a human  And now it looks like  It's pretty natural  It's amazing that they haven't  Figured out a way  To give you hair yet  Cell phones

[02:42:30]  was uh just talk to me yeah it would have been too easy yeah i don't know no one talked to me  at all there's so many fucking channels you're on the list about what my friend are you sure  he was on the list for the rna travel environment oh yeah i think it was it was the maximum tour that  you're doing well i did the maximum tour after that you guys were doing the traveling there's a  conflict there's something going on yeah for some reason i remember hearing that i just want to  let you know man to man we uh try to get you well i would love to do it we're gonna do it this  summer and uh hopefully i'll do it i don't know what happened um no one talked to me at all 
[02:43:00]  though no one i i spoke to no one so if i found it you know i've been having problems with this  kind of stuff anyway so i'll look into it i'll find out what the deal all right very good because  i've heard this from club owners i'm trying to get you my club oh no one said this happy feet  oh it was a good movie joe loves it happy feet was a good movie i got stoned as  and i said let me go see a little kid's movie it might be interesting and uh i i actually enjoyed it  happy feet's a good movie there's these these leopard seals i love uh like watching uh seal seals 
[02:43:30]  kill penguins you ever like see specials on leopard seals oh yeah discovery are the scariest  fucking monsters that live in the water i didn't even know they existed until that uh penguin movie  and they just swim around and just jack penguins they're monsters yeah and uh there's cool leopard  seals in this movie but the movie the basic premise of the movie is these penguins are trying to go  through their life and they they're scared of aliens that they there's like penguins get abducted by  aliens in terms of the aliens of the people and you know aliens abduct them and take it's it's long  convoluted tags on them and stuff i enjoyed the movie it was a good movie how high were you man 
[02:44:00]  that's pretty high yeah pretty high two lollipops two lollipops i've been thinking about smoking  again dude let's do it i've been thinking let's do it right now how long has it been how long have you  stopped for uh it's been um man i'm not gonna sound cool but over 10 years wow if you didn't have a  problem with it why stop if you could do it once in a while i don't know if you could do it once in a  while i mean key with pot is two things getting the right shit and not smoking too much of it  that's the key because when everybody tells me oh i get paranoid i get paranoid you mean reason why 
[02:44:30]  you get paranoid is because you're taking too much all right it's a mind-blowing experience the right  tetrahydrocannabinol if you get it in the right doses will up your world view you have to do it  slowly and cautiously you have to step gently into the water you don't dive into the deep end of the  cold water you walk slowly and i take one hit and wait like an hour for it says i don't even feel  anything let me take another hit and then your four or five hits in you're thinking about the fifth  grade and you're quiet that's the difference you don't want that like crack will wear off after a 
[02:45:00]  couple seconds pot will just linger slowly like he comes on waves so you would think like real good  shit the shit that i smoke one hit and don't even hold it in long yeah yeah uh rogan's a professional  smoker yeah i smoke the stuff he smokes and i smoke once every few weeks and it's such a fine line if  i cough i am fucked you're done really is that it yeah i got charlie murphy so fucking high charlie 
[02:45:30]  murphy smokes pot all the time and on the max and toys like yeah i smoke weed all the time i go dude you  don't smoke shit smoke my shit oh man i don't want to hear about that shit you ain't got no good  shit let me smoke your shit i go go ahead you try some of the train wreck there my friend and i i  got him barbecued i oh and i i made him go in deep because i'll go three four hits and then go on  stage but the normal human cannot go three four hits and go on stage you won't fucking remember  anything you only remember how you got on the stage three or four hits does that oh three or four 
[02:46:00]  hits and you will be fucking on pluto getting great wall i haven't used this i haven't talked  like this in a while how they still talk like this saying well how about if you smoked a whole jay  well you can do it but you got to be experienced you got to be able to handle the matrix i mean that's  it's it's just too strong you can't smoke a whole marijuana and it's different kinds of weed too  there's two different types two very specific strains one's called indica and one sativa and indica  is the easy stuff to grow and that's what most people have and that's the stuff that makes you  mellow makes you want to sit on the couch and eat doritos and watch tv and it gives you the munchies sativa 
[02:46:30]  doesn't give you the munchies and sativa is it's like mostly grown in south america or grown indoors  because it needs a longer growing season it's more complicated to grow it takes longer to grow and  it's totally different high it's like thinking about the universe you're thinking about atoms and  subatomic particles blinking in and out of space and you're like whoa you start thinking quantum  mechanics and physics seeing people's auras and energy i got so fucking high once we did this fear  factor thing we were in san francisco and i had to hang out with the whole crew and eat dinner with 
[02:47:00]  them it was so boring you know they're so square so i just got super super baked in my hotel room  and came down and i wasn't even seeing people i was seeing like entities hiding behind their appearance  and their clothes i was freaking out it was it was real bizarre it's almost like i give it to people  and they think they got laced with acid you know when you get really up it scares the  out of you what's what's living in your brain you're like this stuff where is that hiding  it cleans but it gets that shit out in the open you want to take a look at all that 
[02:47:30]  shit i didn't know i knew quantum physics  so ralph is smoking the first con you're talking yeah ralph is smoking munchie when we got high when  we got high 20 years ago was this stuff is strong back to see i don't know i don't know now it depends  on who you ask if you talk to the police they say no but if you talk to guys who grow it they  say there was always strong stuff around but look this weak shit right now the thing is in in california  we have medical marijuana so they have scientists that are working on pot like crazy botanists that  are potheads that come up with the most evil fucking strains of shit breeding yeah reproduce it 
[02:48:00]  consistently yeah stuff like skunkweed that was so strong that you you know well now they have thc  percentages like they'll tell you the content they have it all broken down what about the calories  like nutritional value on a can of uh corn in the week i'm gonna calories in a joint well you know  when i'm gonna sound cool around all the teenagers i'll go hey you got any tie stick yeah it's not  anymore the train wreck is the shit the train wreck that's my favorite how about like hash is that  still around yeah opium hash you can pass at the medical marijuana yeah that's what we used to 
[02:48:30]  smoke opium it was opium in the hash and it was just really no i don't fuck around with anything  that's addictive i don't want anything that's gonna my body's gonna want to have over and over again  do you think you're addicted to pot no i've stopped smoking weed for months weeks doesn't matter  it's not a physically addictive thing a bunch of times you have an addiction your buddy here  is a way i mean he doesn't i mean you want pot so bad you have to lick it i think rogan is hooked on  i just like it i enjoy it pop-ups are good i i go like all week and not get high and then i get high 
[02:49:00]  like before i go on stage on the weekends i do that all the time but it's not a physically addictive  thing and i don't fuck with anything that's physically addictive i won't even try it i've never  tried coke i've never tried heroin i've never tried and all i'm into is consciousness expanding  psychedelics i'm in the stuff that changes the way i think yeah by the way gotta give the big  plug for uh joe rogan of carolines when we weren't working i was uh just wandering around la and uh  walked into the comedy store and he was on stage and did an hour of just amazing 
[02:49:30]  it's fucking comedy so different than really guys working today yep it's i mean it thanks man it gets  deep it makes you start thinking and there's a ton of laughs in there as well i finally recorded a cd  i've been putting it really yeah i would love it it's called shiny happy jihad and it'll be uh  it'll it's done it's completely finished and uh it'll be out in comedy central in a couple months  i highly recommend you see joe rogan at carolines this weekend sorry rich no hey listen because he's  competing against you but if you're a long hour he's on voice to the governor's totally for market  all right good he is so funny there's never a time i've seen joe not have a good set you just sit 
[02:50:00]  there and you there's some comics and it's different every time right joe pretty much yeah it's always a  little different like i won't watch a comic he barely watches comics but someone like him you  come into the room like if he and you go you got to watch him patrice you got to watch there's  certain comics no if you want to see good comedy i don't like your hat joe do you do material  do you do set material or do you go up there to start um i have so much well i have areas i  definitely want to touch on i have like three or four areas that i always want to but i have so much 
[02:50:30]  material i can go anywhere it's just like you know i've been doing comedy for 18 years now wow so it's  like i just uh you know you know how it is you have an idea in your head and you just go on stage  and just get the party rolling well first you got to have an idea in your head you were looking at  rich first of all we did a one-nighter in seaside about 17 years ago yeah or 16 years at least 16  yeah it was just a one-nighter and um you just you just watch me go he's great man you know yeah 
[02:51:00]  we would love to have you on the tour next summer i would love to be on i can't believe that you guys  try to get in contact with well there was a list that was made yeah you know what man i i don't  know i know it's the biggest bummer and i still love the guy and i even saw him recently uh brian  reagan turned us down he turned down he was too scared of our crowds i don't think so i think he  knows the crowds love him our crowds love regan i think it was an image thing i think it was an image  well that's what i mean by being scared fucking agents yeah i think they were scared he's doing  so well right now that's what it is he wasn't scared he wasn't scared that he wasn't going to 
[02:51:30]  kill he was but he was scared of the crowds and what that would do i think i think his management  might have thought it would look bad if brian reagan was at a show and you know it ends up like altamont  speedway with our fucking crowd and so you know brian reagan can't get another gig he's squeaky clean  because some fucking gut body gets shot or raped in the crowd while he's on stage i don't think it  would ever hurt him but guys are so scared about what's going to hurt their career nothing hurts  you if you're honest a big mistake by the way because the the crowds were unbelievable kelsey 
[02:52:00]  grammar allegedly fucked a 13 year old right remember the whole babysitter scandal allegedly  that went away years ago yes and he survived and he went on to do his big show whatever it was called  what really sucked is dennis reagan turned him down too  that is open for brian avery fisher hall you guys gotta see i saw the billy burr youtube video  sorry isn't that amazing yeah dude when it was going down we're like legendary legendary 
[02:52:30]  the liberty bell dude he that that's what killed me was his knowledge of philly i know was second to  none yeah like he had a fucking encyclopedia of philly and just knew what to throw out at those animals  what i love about bill is he writes so much he's always right you know that guy's always got new  shit he's a very funny guy charlie murphy was talking about him when we were talking about the  the the tour when we were on tour he was saying just bill burr's always got new material just puts  everybody to shame yeah the youtube video is unbelievable if you haven't seen it yet 
[02:53:00]  fuck throw bill burr in the search it was great i love when he's on the show because we get into it you  know he's such a fucking make-believe idealistic guy yeah doesn't he have a black girlfriend  isn't that what's going on yes uh yeah those guys are always like my manager is a black girlfriend  same shit anything black people do is great yeah loves it there's a lot of white a lot of white  guilt there but we'll talk about it's hilarious finance politics anything and we're always we  always end up on such complete opposite ends of the spectrum he gave me a book to read i read like 
[02:53:30]  the first two chapters and he keeps saying did you read the book did you read the book i go it's on  my night table i read the first chapter it's all bullshit and he's like you didn't even read the  fucking thing you didn't even get past when he was fucking nine years old and i knew he was just  full of shit and we'll go off and let and then you know we're done with the break and it's like you  fucking guy liberals you know you gotta write new material man like i've been i'm getting a lot  of shit lately i don't care what people think but this i got pulled over that cop yeah and the  shit i said to him like when he asked yeah what did you say jimmy oh i don't even want to get into 
[02:54:00]  it now but he's like you know how fast you were going and the retorts i had you realize you're speeding  no but then again i'm drunk we got it let me tell you people steal my stuff already you're  drinking tonight why you're buying he's a cop i saw the lights i thought it was a disco and then  the cop pulls me over right he goes so why are there bloody child's underpants in your pocket  that's how it starts i'm not going to give away the punchline because i haven't sold them yet  go see jim new year's eve and he'll have the punchline for you atlantic city baby atlantic 
[02:54:30]  say we got a question for joe rogan jim in illinois what's up hey man this is jeff hey uh  joe as public as public as you are about uh getting high and everything aren't you ever  concerned about uh being made an example of like they did doming chong uh if i ever get busted it  would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the anti-marijuana movement because i will talk  about it and i'll talk about it everywhere constantly i'll talk about it in newspapers websites  everything and people will realize the facts behind it and the real facts behind it are 
[02:55:00]  cigarettes kill 400 000 people every year in this country and no one does a thing to stop it  marijuana has killed no one ever in 10 000 years of use there's no reason whatsoever it should be  illegal now if you're down for your daddy telling you what to do no matter what you just got to listen  to him then don't smoke pot but i think there's some laws that are fucking completely ridiculous and  pot is the most completely ridiculous and i'm a guy who respects cops i am pro law enforcement all  the way i have friends that are cops i do jujitsu with a bunch of cops i've been in martial arts 
[02:55:30]  my whole life and i've known cops my whole life and i've never had a problem with cops i get pulled  over it's yes sir no sir here's my license i've never had a problem with a cop being a dick to me  never had a problem with a cop being giving me a hard time i've always been respectful it's not  cops it's the law and the law is based on economics because the dea is a gigantic business now  and it has nothing to do with protecting people has nothing to do with making sure children are  okay because why is liquor legal why why are prescription drugs legal why or why is it so 
[02:56:00]  easy to get someone on prozac and so easy to get people on zoloft and all these different drugs that  are designed to change your mental chemistry and that's not what it's about it's it's all about  economics and if yeah but you said they no one's ever died from potter you can't say well how do you  know somebody's never in a car accident because they were that person's a fucking retard car accidents  anyway yeah you get in a car accident if you were how did you text messages how do you die if you're  in a car accident you were going eight miles an hour i did by the way i disagree i disagree that 
[02:56:30]  it's economics i think it's more because i think they make more of a tax i think it's more of an  ideological thing where like the same reason they're against stem cell ratio the pot is just seen by  people as you get high drug like cocaine is the perception of it is fucking is what the problem is  i think they can make more taxing it than they do allowing the dea but you can't you can't patent it it  grows that's the problem you can tackle alcohol is very tough to make it's difficult you gotta go  it's very tobacco tobacco's tough to grow too bro it's not it's not an easy drug to grow marijuana  will grow everywhere if you had a crop duster plane just flew around dropping seeds you come back in 
[02:57:00]  three weeks you'd have pot everywhere here's the thing too with pot and they also look anybody that's  doing heroin or coke or addicted started usually started with pot so what so what you can start  with alcohol and go right to heroin that's the gateway drug is the ridiculous argument because usually  they didn't start with pot they started you know breaking into the old man's liquor cabinet the  real problem is people have drugs and it's all drugs under one umbrella when you put everything  under an umbrella you you negate the the reality there's totally different reactions that your 
[02:57:30]  brain has to these substances caffeine's a very serious drug ten thousand people a year die from  caffeine nobody dies from pot and it's illegal pot's not heroin yeah it's not but it's an illegal drug so  it's under the same umbrella schedule one it's more illegal than cocaine there are people  the schedule too there are people doing fucking major time for weed yeah and people that have  killed people yeah that get out before you know a guy that's stealing weed my mom views it as pot and  heroin it's pretty much just drugs yes drugs well most people do if they're ill-informed the real 
[02:58:00]  reason why pot was made illegal was completely economic and a lot of people don't know about  this but marijuana was made illegal in 1935 because they came out with a product called the decorticator  see before that hemp was a huge crop and it was used to make the decorticator  it was used hemp was used to make parachutes and paper and all sorts of different things but it was  used mostly by slave they used slaves to make turn the hemp fiber into pulp well it was too you know  once 1865 when slavery was outlawed they started using cotton more often and then in 1935 it was on 
[02:58:30]  the cover of popular science magazine hemp the new billion dollar crop and william randolph  hurst owned the newspapers and he also owned all these paper plants and hemp is a far superior paper  he was going to have to transfer all of his paper plants into hemp paper and so instead of doing  that what they decided to do was go after the hemp industry by making marijuana this street slang for  this drug but which it wasn't even marijuana was a slang for a mexican wild tobacco leaf and they 
[02:59:00]  attached it to cannabis they attached to hemp and said that this is what they use marijuana is making  these blacks and mexicans rape all these white women so congress outlawed marijuana not even  knowing that they were outlawing the crop hemp they didn't even know what they were doing and that  was 1935 then they came out with all these movies reefer madness all this crazy shit and they kept pumping  out this propaganda and to this day it still persists because of harry anslinger and because of william  randolph hurst that's the only reason why pot's illegal it's his perception then it's a perception 
[02:59:30]  about but it's economic i mean the dea is a monstrous institution there's so many people with with  corporate prisons with privately owned prisons and all this money in the dea and all this money  in the prisons 50 of the people that are in prison are in prison because of drug offenses and out of  those drug offenses something like 85 of them are marijuana i mean that's unbelievable that's a lot of  fucking people that's yeah that's a lot of money and that's where it's economic and that's why you  can't just make it legal then just chaos people would be out of jobs everything would go crazy  lobbyists is too much remember the beer doesn't when you see all those ads for like uh the the 
[03:00:00]  marijuana ads or the the drugs like you support drugs you support terrorism that those are all by  beer companies alcohol companies sponsor those fucking ads they make those ads they don't want  marijuana to be legal because it would fuck them up it goes well with a nice cold beer i think it would  help just a question about the uh they should get along about the prison thing because if they're  putting guys away from prison i mean uh it costs a lot of money to keep a prisoner in x amount of  a thousand dollars a year and plus they have to keep building prisons to put more people in 
[03:00:30]  which cost the state a lot of money but they're private they're private have they privatized  yeah yeah it's huge it's huge all right listen i hate to interrupt but we gotta leave well you  got another hour with holy shit we gotta go we have to leave early today we got a meeting we're  filming the next commercial uh we asked joe to stay and you're gonna stay sure all right you got  voss to work with it's gonna be the the voss amazing racist and you got the amazing racist  and you got octane fit them in fuck yeah man fit them in to do a song or two yeah man i want to hear
