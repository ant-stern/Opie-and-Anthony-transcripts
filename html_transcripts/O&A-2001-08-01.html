<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a boastful discussion of the wildly successful "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" listener promotion, contrasting it with a rival New York station's failed bumper sticker campaign.  The hosts expressed cynicism about an upcoming appearance on Bill O'Reilly's show, anticipating potential negative editing, drawing on past experiences, including a Time Magazine interview where only a minor comment was used.  They discussed strategies to mitigate such editing, such as using a DAT recorder.  Technical difficulties impacting some listeners' reception of the initial "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" announcement prompted numerous calls.

A significant segment focused on a news story about a massage parlor and a masseuse, "Mr. Jew," accused of sexual assault, with the hosts speculating on the $31 million lawsuit.  Listener calls detailed their own uncomfortable and sometimes sexually suggestive experiences with massage therapists, including unwanted touching and implied prostitution.  An 18-year-old listener, Becky, was invited to the studio and showed her breasts on-air, aligning with the "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" theme.  A massage therapist, Taryn, also called, offering her professional perspective.  Further listener calls detailed bizarre encounters with massage therapists, including an unexpected foot massage escalating into unwanted advances at a bed and breakfast, and a girlfriend's revelation of prostitution after a suggested spa visit.  One caller described a massage parlor raid, another a massage parlor with a menu of sexual services that didn't deliver. Another call recounted a wife's surprise birthday massage gone wrong.  A call to a brothel by a caller with Tourette's Syndrome was also featured, as well as further discussion and suggestive commentary about Becky's breasts, and plans for a future "WOW Summit."  Jim Brewer and Jim Norton were in-studio guests throughout this segment.

The show then shifted to a challenge to identify the first thirteen MTV music videos, revealing the hosts' limited knowledge of early MTV.  Studio guests and callers offered incorrect guesses, with the conversation frequently digressing into discussions of other artists and MTV memories.  Becky's studio appearance and subsequent online photos were again mentioned.  Sarah Silverman called in to discuss a recent controversy surrounding a joke she told containing the word "chink,"  her subsequent apology, and the backlash she faced. The hosts discussed their generally negative view of female comedians, with exceptions for Silverman and a few others.  Jim Brewer shared anecdotes about working at Saturday Night Live and promoted his upcoming heavy metal comedy tour, discussing the difficulties of selling merchandise at previous events.

The final segment focused on the hosts' financial woes, including significantly lower-than-expected returns from merchandise sales and a dispute with a record company over unpaid royalties for their CD, "Dementor World," allegedly due to their on-air criticism of the company.  Anecdotes included a record company owner secretly undercutting their CD sales and a Florida cable access host profiting from recordings of their appearance without their consent. Jim Brewer recounted his own financial exploitation experiences, including those involving a goat boy doll and other bizarre merchandise.  Becky was again positively mentioned, focusing on her physical attributes, and a "Sex for Sam" event was promoted.  A caller named Patty engaged in sexually suggestive and vulgar exchanges with the hosts.  A conversation with another caller, Walt, about arranging a massage for Patty took place.  Several sponsors, including Pinnacle horny goat weed and Lifestyles condoms, were mentioned with sexually suggestive commentary. The show concluded with further promotion of the "Sex for Sam" event and a recap of the guests.  The broadcast was punctuated throughout by vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and offensive stereotypes.

Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Cancel your appointment.  Oh, yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Ah.  Wow.  Look at me singing on that piece.  The worst singer from the radio show.  True boogie making me sound good.  There you go.  See, anyone could be a rock star.  You got the right people working for you in a studio.  That's what my mother thought.  Yeah.  Always remember that.  Woo.  Woo. 
[00:01:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple numbers for you.  If you're in the New York area and you want to call the show, we love your participation.  You know that by now.  877-692-1027. 
[00:02:00]  Anywhere else, and we want to hear from you guys as well, 866-277-4WOW.  Yell at your radio station if they don't have that phone number posted, okay?  Right.  Very important that you participate in the show.  The more you participate, the less we have to do.  That's our motto.  We figured that out years ago, Anthony.  But very excited to tell Rochester it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  The first Whip-Em-Out Wednesday for Rochester, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  A very, very easy concept.  You write WOW, and you put it on the back of your car.  And if the girls feel like it, they will flash you.  And it happens.  Happens like crazy.  Hundreds and hundreds of people get WOWed every single Wednesday because of this radio show.  Yes.  That's why we call it the greatest radio promotion ever.  Ever.  Because I'm listening to other stations in New York.  I'll even give them a plug.  I think it was Z100.  They're trying to do a bumper sticker campaign. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  And they're trying to make it sound exciting.  You know, the van pulled over this lady, and she's got tickets for Destiny's Child or someone.  Or something like that.  Who cares?  You know, they're trying to get, like, probably 100,000 bumper stickers out there.  They're trying.  And they're only going to give away a prize maybe once a week.  Yeah.  With our promotion, there's winners every day of the week.  Every day there's winners, and you could be a winner.  And you don't have to do anything.  Right.  You just drive.  It's not qualifying then. 
[00:03:30]  You know, the van pulls you over on those bumper sticker contests, and you win, like, maybe a stereo if you're lucky.  I heard the promo, and it's like, we just pulled over a car, and she's listening to Z100.  I can't believe it.  Oh, really?  She has the bumper sticker, and she's listening.  And they're in the studio, like, oh, my God.  This is unbelievable.  I can't believe it.  Oh, my God.  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  Unbelievable. 
[00:04:00]  Give her those outcast tickets.  And you'll qualify to go on a trip, but there's eight billion people qualify.  Let me give you a little secret, too.  Uh-oh.  You're ruining some more radio?  No, no, no, no, no.  The best way to get wowed, seriously, is to get wowed on your car when you're going to a concert.  Oh, yeah.  The girls feel extra festive.  Of course they do.  Because they're, yeah, they're boozing it up.  They're, you know, they're snorting their Coke, dropping their E, and their X. 
[00:04:30]  Nice girls.  No, I'm just kidding.  But they flash like crazy on the way to shows.  It's amazing.  It really is.  So, there you have it, Rochester.  It's Whipping Mile Wednesday.  You just write wow any way you want on the back of your car.  It's going to take time.  In the new cities, it takes time.  Yeah.  Philadelphia is starting to feel the love from the ladies.  Oh, yeah.  We're hearing stories of wowing going on in Philly.  So, that's that, okay?  Mm-hmm.  And if you're seeing anything out there, we would love to hear from you today.  That's how it works.  Okay, Anthony.  We should talk about Bill O'Reilly real fast. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my God.  We just had a meeting with the Fox people.  And they want us on Bill O'Reilly's show so effing bad.  I got to tell you, the girl they sent over is good.  She's good.  She was...  She was working it.  She wouldn't take no for an answer.  She's a producer.  Yeah.  And I guess they're doing some kind of documentary on the media and how it affects today's youth.  Bill O'Reilly's going to talk about how the media is destroying the planet.  How, you know, things that kids and people see on a daily basis, I guess, are destroying humanity. 
[00:05:30]  That old gag.  Yeah.  Like, our show is part of the downfall of the world.  So, if you know anything about Bill O'Reilly, he obviously doesn't like this type of radio.  No.  So, Anthony and I are like, why should we go on your show?  Where's the upside?  Now, we were kind of interested when we thought we'd be on live.  Yeah.  Because if you're live, you can kind of defend yourself pretty well.  Yeah.  We found out it's going to be a tape piece. 
[00:06:00]  Ouch.  That's where the problem is.  He says A.  We say B in defense.  What they cut out is B.  You hear A.  You hear a bastardized version of B, which turns into C.  There you go.  Yeah.  The deal is...  Rick's saying I'm ripping them off.  A, B, C, and D.  Right.  It's not A, B, D.  D.  Then C.  It's A, B, C, D.  But I guess he's doing an hour documentary. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And our participation would be tops four or five minutes.  But he wants to talk to us for an hour.  I don't like that.  That's why we have a problem.  They're only going to find the four or five minutes where we look like complete tools and put it on the TV.  Let me look back at the Time article.  I don't have to go too far back to bring up a great example of how you get screwed in those circumstances.  We did a little article for Time Magazine. 
[00:07:00]  Time Magazine.  We spoke with him for well over an hour up in the conference room.  He asked us questions about the radio show, about our lives, whatnot.  We answered them in a very intelligent, very concise manner, Opie.  And what does he print as far as a quote from me?  The only quote I got in Time Magazine was an off-the-cuff remark when he came down to the office and for a second, for a split second, stupid-ass me felt safe.  Because it's in our office.  He's a guy I'm figuring will goof a little bit. 
[00:07:30]  So I point at the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen poster and go, look at how hot they're getting.  You can tell, yeah, Ashley's the goer.  Mary, I can't even tell which one's the goer anymore.  They're both hot.  And that's the quote that makes it in Time Magazine.  My only quote.  And then when he calls up, because we're bitching about him after the article came out, he says that our answers were boring.  Or my answers were boring. 
[00:08:00]  And that was the funniest thing you said.  He asked the questions.  But you make a good point.  You didn't even have to be involved in the actual interview.  Hell no.  Didn't have to be there.  You wasted an hour and a half because you didn't use any of that.  Wasted.  I've been playing two-forts.  So then she's saying, you know, don't you guys, you know, want the exposure and stuff, Anthony?  Yeah.  Like, we're not going to lead ourselves to slaughter.  To get some exposure.  Because that's what they're doing.  Walking it.  Now we have the option to say yes or no to certain things because we're doing a lot of what they call media these days. 
[00:08:30]  So now we can pick and choose some of this stuff that probably we're trying to pick ones that we're not going to be made asses in or twisted around and stuff like that.  So why the hell would we walk in, like Opie said, to the slaughterhouse?  You don't just voluntarily go, moo, okay, shoot the bolt in my head and start cutting. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  No.  And the point we try to make at the end of the thing is we don't care what people say about us.  But we just want them to be fair.  Yeah.  And if you're going to edit a piece, I can't see how they're going to be fair.  And have our best interest in mind.  Bill O'Reilly says something.  And then we defend ourselves.  And we do a good job.  And we do a good job of it.  And that gets cut apart in the editing room.  I will be so pissed.  And there'll be nothing we can do about it.  They're not going to let us in on the editing session. 
[00:09:30]  You know, he gets to pick and choose what's going to make him look better and what's going to put his point across.  Because that's what, it's his show.  And he's got this point.  Right.  And we know because we play the other side when we have celebrities in here and stuff.  Do you think Cindy Williams had a snowball chance in hell of getting her point across and coming off?  It wasn't happening.  You're talking to two guys that are really good at spinning things.  And that was live.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  Imagine what we could have done if we just had a tapey.  Oh, my God.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Listen, what you guys ought to do is show how much of a tool this guy really is  and go in with your own DAT recorder.  Put it in your clothes.  Wear one.  Go in wired.  And when it all gets aired, go on, give the tapes to Rick and play them back all throughout the day after this whole thing is shot.  You know what?  Tell people how much of a tool he is.  Of course. 
[00:10:30]  I like how you're thinking.  Yeah, it might be good.  Because Mr. O'Reilly himself will be calling us to try to persuade us.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you didn't hear that one yet, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's going to try to...  He's going to call us and persuade us and convince us to go into the slaughterhouse.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know what?  There you go and you burn his ass.  Well, Stephanie, the producer, said, is there anything we could do?  That would be something I would at least listen to, where we could bring a DAT recorder and tape the whole thing,  and they would have to allow us to air it on our radio show. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  There you go.  All right.  Going up, Nick.  Thank you.  Rock on.  Thank you.  Nicky, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right, check it out.  You've got to look at it like a Don Rickles type of thing.  You go to a Don Rickles show in hopes that he'll start ragging on you.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Nicky.  We have to check out what's going on in Cleveland.  New problem.  I didn't think we had fans in Columbus and Cleveland. 
[00:11:30]  Guy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's happening?  Hey, I think it finally went back on, but Columbus was off for the first ten minutes, and I was getting very upset.  Why weren't we on the air in Columbus?  I guess the satellite was messed up.  Yeah, Pete's working on it right now.  He's in there trying to figure out why they're not getting the signal.  All right, we're going to save our good stuff until all the affiliates are up and running.  Thank God.  Hey, you guys have a great show. 
[00:12:00]  I love the bit with the peach and the gay guy.  I love the wow.  Oh, cool.  Very original.  Thank you, guy.  Get the wow in the back of your car, all right?  Okay.  This is amazing.  I'm feeling love.  I know.  I'm feeling love because all of a sudden, like, the phones are, look at these people are freaking.  Pat.  Hey, Pat, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Thank God.  My radio's back on.  It's back to normal.  I was all worried there that you guys got canceled here.  What were they playing instead?  Well, they were just playing the regular music, but, I mean, you know, I didn't know. 
[00:12:30]  It was like three weeks.  It's been like almost exactly a month, I think, since you've been on.  Yeah.  Yeah, you thought they gave us a month and that was it.  Yeah, and, you know, they just bailed on you guys, but, no, it's Pat God now.  So I was just, I was worried.  I drive around all day and, you know, I've gotten, I kind of learned to love you guys, so.  Oh, cool.  Well, thank you, Pat.  Yeah, it was in Cleveland, man.  People love you out here.  You missed the first ten minutes of the show?  Yeah, come on. 
[00:13:00]  I just, I heard something that you're waiting on hold, but.  I can't believe you missed our big announcement.  Wow.  I'll listen in, man.  Guys, cut.  We were only allowed to.  Catch everybody back up in Cleveland.  All right.  Thanks, Pat.  Later.  We can't say it again, though, Pat.  That's the deal we made with the boss, that they would allow us to say the big announcement once.  Yeah, just once.  What a coincidence.  I missed that.  All the affiliates were down when we made our big announcement, Anthony.  Damn.  Oh, man.  And it concerned everyone. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know what to do now.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Man, I missed the first ten minutes, and my head's going to explode, dude.  Oh, we had a huge announcement, too.  The first ten minutes is the best.  Three to three ten, everything's put on hold so I can listen to you guys.  Right.  And then we weren't there.  Cleveland, freaking, I don't know what happened.  I'm listening to the Beastie Boys.  Oh, Steve, we had a huge announcement.  Now we're going to have to see if the bosses will allow us to announce it again. 
[00:14:00]  Dude, they got to.  I'm pissed.  Oh.  Piss.  All right, Steve, thank you.  Major love, dude.  All right, man.  Later.  Had something to do with Cleveland and Columbus, too.  Oh, see.  Oh, man.  Froyo has an answer to what happened, why we weren't on.  Yeah.  Because somebody must have accidentally thrown the satellite out of orbit while trying to  navigate foundrymusic.com.  Because you know how difficult that is.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, Jim.  Yo.  Jim from Philly, what's up? 
[00:14:30]  Hey, I got the announcement, so Cleveland's 10 minutes behind.  That's their loss.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  You got it?  Yeah, I got the announcement.  Are you excited about it, or what?  Oh, absolutely.  It'll drive them all nuts until they find out about it.  Well, I got to see if we're allowed to announce that again, maybe later in the show.  So what's up, Jim?  Hey, listen.  I've been listening to you since you came on.  I was waiting for the first day that you impressed me, the Cindy Williams thing.  That did it?  Oh.  Thank God.  But, Jim, we worked our asses off for a month before that.  Some people's expectations are a little high. 
[00:15:00]  Jim, not even a tinge before that?  Maybe something like, oh, he almost has me.  No, no, no.  We gave him enough that he stayed on board.  The eye popping out on the boxing, that had a tingle.  That almost had you when the guy popped his eye out?  But chills with Cindy Williams.  Cool.  You could feel the flop sweat.  Oh, yeah.  Right on, Jim.  It was beautiful.  All right.  Well, thank you.  You got it.  And I'm glad you heard the announcement.  Yep.  All right.  Everybody's saying we shouldn't do O'Reilly. 
[00:15:30]  Remember the Simpsons episode when Homer was accused of touching the babysitter's ass?  And he was given an interview and they cut it up to make him look bad.  And then other people reverting to, reverting, it's a spaz line, reverting to Mars attacks where  every time the Martians would try to pull the humans back in by saying that they didn't  mean what happened and they're sorry.  And then all of a sudden, they just massacre a whole bunch more of them.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  So we keep walking into these situations.  We're going to get killed again.  Plus, you and I are too smart for these producers.  Because that Stephanie girl, she goes, well, you guys did that 2020 downtown piece, which  is going to air sometime.  I don't know.  There's September.  September during sweeps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she goes, just wait till you see what they do to you guys.  She goes, I used to work at 2020.  Just wait till you see what they do to you guys in that piece.  I'm like, Stephanie, that's exactly what we're trying to tell you. 
[00:16:30]  Because we taped the whole interview with Allison Stewart and everyone.  It was like a two, three hour interview.  They got to narrow it down with commercials and stuff for maybe tops a half hour.  No, it's part of a whole show.  Maybe 10 minutes.  Right.  So obviously, they're going to spin it their own way.  And that's the point we try to make with Stephanie today.  Yeah.  And we did, obviously, voluntarily do the 2020 thing.  But it's a show about us. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  You know, so if they want to spin it differently, that's their prerogative.  Whatever.  But when we're on a show where Bill O'Reilly is discussing an issue that he believes strongly in,  we're the opposing viewpoint.  And it's edited.  He can do whatever he pleases.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  Chuck, you're next.  Chuck.  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, dude, that announcement you guys made before?  Yeah.  I swear to God, I can't wait for that.  The affiliates do not know what they're missing out on.  Yeah, but the deal we made with the boss, we would announce it once. 
[00:17:30]  I can't even tell him?  Nah.  Oh, that's dark, man.  No, we got to talk to the boss to see if we're allowed to say it again.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Cool, man.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  I know what happened in Cleveland.  The opposing station cut the cables.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  It's from Los in Newark.  I knew very well.  Yeah, I knew one of the people very well that was responsible for that. 
[00:18:00]  Heidi.  Oh, Heidi.  Yeah.  I worked with Heidi.  Franco, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  How are you?  Hey.  Yesterday, you ran out of show.  And, Opie, you never got to the article about the two girls in the massage parlor.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  That's classic.  All right.  We have to take our first break.  We have the news story.  We'll do the whole thing next, okay?  All right.  But, basically, a massage parlor that we sent our girlfriends, our mothers, gave away certificates 
[00:18:30]  to our fine listeners.  They're in a heap of trouble.  Yeah.  And we got the story next.  We'll get right into it, okay?  Okay.  Anthony, very nervous because his mom went to the same massage parlor.  I sent my mommy there.  We'll get into that next, all right?  Thanks for reminding me, Franco.  Oh, thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  We'll be back with that in just a few.  Let them hang. 
[00:19:00]  Let them hang like the animals they are.  Anthony Pinnacle-Horning Goatweed.  Hey, everybody.  How's the sex life?  Is it treating you okay?  If you're ever having this inkling that it used to be better than it is now, go ahead.  Inkle for a bit.  Are you inkling?  Are you getting an inkling that maybe your sex life isn't as good as it used to be? 
[00:19:30]  Pinnacle-Horning Goatweed.  Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  Surprise!  Pinnacle-Horning Goatweed.  It's clinically tested and doctor-recommended.  It's an herbal complex and it enhances your libido and sexual performance.  60% of the male study participants reported positive benefits from Pinnacle-Horning Goatweed,  ranging from increased desire and frequency and satisfaction during sex.  When it comes to sex, don't forget those three P's.  Pleasure, passion.  No, no.  Not that P word.  Pinnacle.  Pinnacle-Horning Goatweed. 
[00:20:00]  Get it at GNC, the vitamin shop, another fine health food store.  Or you can call up Pinnacle, 1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle-Horning Goatweed.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow!  1027 WNEW.  Are you down with the sickness?  Down with the sickness?  They call it the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  866-2774.  Wow, Anthony.  Yes. 
[00:20:30]  We got that problem straightened out, right?  With the affiliates?  Yeah, we got all the affiliates up and running now.  Yes, that's good.  Came, uh, they missed out on the, uh, little announcement that we made at the beginning of the show.  Kind of important.  Um, we made a huge announcement, uh, right at 3 o'clock.  We, uh, actually weren't even supposed to make it, but, uh, we talked to Boston to let us say it once.  And, um...  And now he wishes pretty much that we didn't say it.  And now we can't repeat it.  But there was some, uh, markets that, uh, some cities, excuse me, that didn't hear it. 
[00:21:00]  A lot of the cities did not hear it, Anthony.  So what do you want to do?  Is the boss listening right now, Ben?  Uh, I didn't see, uh, Ken Stevens, um, in the hallway.  Anthony, what I'm thinking is that, um, we can whisper the, the big announcement that we started today's show with.  He doesn't listen to what happened here.  If he hears us saying something, he might tune in. 
[00:21:30]  But if we, uh, if we say it real low.  Turn that music down.  All right, we'll turn the music off, okay?  If we say it really low.  See, we're going to...  We're going to talk this low.  Like, really, really low.  It's got to be...  So you're going to want to turn up your radio really loud.  It's got to be very low.  Can you hear me?  It's got to be like this.  Look, turn up your radio really loud.  Make sure you can hear us even while we're talking very low.  Just turn up the radio real loud and put your ear to the radio. 
[00:22:00]  All right, I don't want to, I don't want to, no, I'm going to say this, but it's the announcement.  We'll make sure they have their videos.  Can you, can you hear them?  Can you hear them?  All right, turn up a little louder and put your ear to the speaker, okay?  All right, at three o'clock.  Better turn up a little louder because we've got to really talk a little now. 
[00:22:30]  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  You don't.  Don't talk.  I want you to...  I want you to...  I want you to...  I want you to...  I love that.  I love that.  I love that old gang. 
[00:23:00]  I want you to get someone every time.  Leo from Brooklyn on the instant feedback.  No, it's not fair to the new markets.  Yeah.  But look, now you're in on the gag.  You're in on the gag.  Mac from Jersey.  Oh, no, here comes Alice in Chains.  That old gag.  A good one when I know it's coming.  We've done that to New York a couple times.  Not this bit again, you effing tools. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, but you're in on it this time.  Right.  If you heard it the first time.  Just imagine all the new cities turning up their radio and putting their ear right next  to the speaker for that.  Well, hopefully no one got hurt.  Right.  We have been known to blow out a few systems with that little gag.  It's fun, right?  But see, the next time we do it, you'll be in on it.  See how it works?  Yeah, we'll do it again when we get a bunch of new cities. 
[00:24:00]  You passed the audition.  Now you're part of the club.  See?  A little initiation.  All right, where's that Fox story?  We've got to get into the massage parlor.  We're going to want to stop it, though.  Can you bring that over here?  And we've got A, which is B, or B, which is A?  That's A?  Okay.  Anthony, you want to set this up?  Which one is this?  This is the massage parlor thing that we couldn't get to yesterday.  Yeah.  Maximus Day.  What's the matter with my mommy?  Cheese.  Sal said she's out shopping and she can't be reached. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, damn it.  What?  She's out shopping.  She's shopping.  We need Anthony's mom for this.  She does do that a lot.  She's out shopping.  Are they trying to get a hold of her?  I haven't tried her cell phone.  No answer.  Anthony's mommy.  She loves to shop.  Please give us a call, okay?  Yeah.  Well, it's a little day spa.  One out on Long Island.  Maximus Day Spa.  Out there on Long Island.  It seems there was this masseuse there who took some liberties with some of the girls 
[00:25:00]  that came in to get massages.  Some of the ladies.  Right.  He would digitally manipulate.  There were two fingers involved.  Right.  You could say that, right?  And some oil.  And some oil.  He'd use a little oil like they do when they're lubing up your thighs, maybe, and massaging  you.  He wouldn't stop there.  No.  No.  And this is a high-end place. 
[00:25:30]  We have sent people we know and love to this place.  Well, hundreds of guys for Mother's Day and Valentine's Day sent their lady certificates  to this place.  Look at Rick.  What did you do?  Well, on our wedding day, I sent Linda there with, like, her whole, her whole, like, all  the bridesmaids.  Wow.  A smorgasbord for that guy.  And she got, like, the full, you know, wedding package.  I don't even know what that includes.  Wow. 
[00:26:00]  All those laid out.  He was probably playing all those girls like a piano.  Nice.  Yeah, so we have sent a lot of people to high-end places.  This type of thing, you know, doesn't go on at a high-end place, obviously.  And this woman came forward, and now a lot of women are coming forward.  Yeah.  Because there's one massage guy, Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  He's an Asian guy, and his name is Mr. Jew.  Swear to God.  What's his first name?  Yang Chang.  Mr. 
[00:26:30]  Kang Chang.  Kang Chang.  Something.  Jew.  Jew.  Right.  So you want to play the little tape?  Yeah, let's see what the news did with this story.  See, I sent Sandy there.  She's gone back many times.  Uh-oh.  Now I think I understand.  I sent my mom there.  That's why we need to get your mom on the phone.  She went there for a whole nice day of pampering.  And your mom.  Who knows if she was digitally manipulated?  She might have been digitally manipulated by the Jew. 
[00:27:00]  By a Jew.  Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  I hope she calls.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the story.  We'll stop it as we go here.  Or maybe not.  All right.  Now to the sexual secrets behind the closed doors of a spa.  Yes.  A woman believes she is the victim of sex abuse, said one of them, and others are stepping forward.  Linda Schmidt has the story.  She's in Westbury, Long Island right now.  Linda.  That's right.  They're John and Rosanna.  Well, what started out as a day of relaxation quickly turned into a day of horror for at least one woman from Long Island. 
[00:27:30]  Now she has told her story to Fox 5 News, and we have concealed her identity.  I said to myself, this is a well-known place.  He has to be a professional.  This Long Island woman was looking forward to her massage in Day of Beauty in June at the Maximus Day Spa in Westbury.  Her husband had given her a gift certificate for their anniversary.  But during the massage, she says masseur, Kyung Joo, sexually assaulted her.  He was trying to pull my leg out, and I was very tense. 
[00:28:00]  And I'm laying there with my eyes closed, and all I remember is him going and getting the oils, and then all of a sudden he was in my lower private area.  And I just jumped.  Yeah.  Like, I just jumped.  Sweet, merciful crap!  Like, I was very surprised.  And I froze.  In shock, she says she got dressed and immediately told a female employee.  I proceeded to tell her crying what happened, and she just hugged me and said, it's not right, it's not your fault, it's not your fault. 
[00:28:30]  Well, she knew exactly how I felt.  As it turns out, Mr. Jew is not licensed as a masseur in New York.  Mr. Jew.  All right, I recognize the voice.  That's my mom.  Yeah.  That's why she won't go?  The woman is now suing him and Maximus Spa for $31 million.  The purpose of this lawsuit is really designed to send a message to places like Maximus and other spas that this kind of improper behavior will not be tolerated. 
[00:29:00]  I got to defend that place, though.  Why?  It's a high-end place.  Oh, yeah.  And they didn't know who they were hiring.  It seems like it's just this.  The lawyer's like, I got to give a message to this place.  Like, you know, all the masseuses over there are doing this.  Yeah, it seems like it was just this one guy.  And how much are they suing for?  $31 million.  $31 million.  I mean, all right.  You know, he slips a knuckle or two.  Two.  Two.  I mean, yeah, it's horrible.  You know, it's awful. 
[00:29:30]  I'd be, you know, you kick the guy's ass or something.  But $31 million.  I'm thinking, you know, the lady should get, like, a gift certificate for, like, the Outback.  Right.  You get a Bloomin' Onion, maybe a steak.  Right.  Sure.  But $31 million.  $31 million?  I mean, for God's sake, I don't know how many junior high school girls I'd owe money to.  Back in.  What?  I'm talking about the old days.  That's where men and women, you're really out of work. 
[00:30:00]  That's where men and women are completely different.  Yeah.  If you're going for a massage at a...  Oh, my God.  Imagine you're a guy.  No.  No.  Hear me out.  And you're, like, at a high-end, legit place.  And there's a lady, you know, massaging you.  And she goes for the private.  That's what I mean.  You're not even thinking twice.  This is, like, great.  You're pulling out tip money for her.  You're not going to, like, jump up and go, oh, my God.  And, you know, complain to anybody.  What are you doing?  Imagine right now.  She touched me.  She violated me. 
[00:30:30]  I was laying there.  She pulled out my leg and touched my handbag.  She touched me where the bathing suit covers.  You're opening your legs.  You're going into your wallet and pulling out tip money.  Come for God's sake.  Hey, that was good.  That's where we're completely different.  Happy ending?  Happy ending?  Happy ending?  Happy ending?  Yankee cranky?  Let's continue.  Since this woman's story became public, two more women have come forward, 
[00:31:00]  claiming they, too, were improperly touched by the same masseur.  Claiming they, too, on money.  These incidents allegedly happened about two years ago.  Mr. Jew's attorney says his client is innocent,  and that money motivated the other women to accuse Mr. Jew.  You've got two women, 18 months ago and two years ago,  who never told anyone about this alleged inappropriate behavior by Mr. Jew.  They read an article in the paper.  They see $31 million.  And so far, Mr. Jew is charged with that one incident that allegedly happened back in June. 
[00:31:30]  He is charged with forcible touching, which is a Class A misdemeanor,  punishable by up to a year in jail.  By the way, the state is also investigating this case.  We're live in Westbury, Long Island.  I'm Linda Schmidt, Fox 5 News.  John and Rosanna, back to you.  Thank you, Linda.  There's the story.  Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  What's happening, Mr. Jew?  Here's a lady on the line that goes to that place quite often.  Katie.  Yep.  What's up?  I have an appointment there every one Saturday a month. 
[00:32:00]  Every month you go there?  Every month I go there.  To the Westbury one?  Yeah.  Yeah, I get the water journey and then the hour-long massage.  What do you get?  The what?  The water journey.  Water journey.  My chick had the water journey.  Yeah, it's great.  The water.  What is the water journey?  It's, I don't know.  I never asked.  They put you in some pool, I heard.  Yeah.  Some, like, ridiculous shower with things coming from all directions, I think.  And then, like, a waterfall falls on your head and you're naked. 
[00:32:30]  Mr. Jew uses his face like a loofah.  Grinding the area, I think it's called.  Did you ever have Mr. Jew at that place?  No.  You know, I'm stupid.  I've always requested a woman because I'm more comfortable.  See?  I can't tell you how many times that would have been the perfect ending.  You know, the guys, masseuse guys, have to be gay.  You shouldn't allow, you shouldn't have your chick going to a masseuse that isn't gay.  Because for God's sake, the guy's going to be feeling her up all over her body and he's  going to get off on it.  And there's no way you're telling me he's a professional, like a doctor or something. 
[00:33:00]  You're a masseuse.  You're a guy.  You're massaging women.  You're going to be getting off on touching these girls.  He's not supposed to touch the boobies or the privates, though.  Yeah, but you touch the ass.  Yeah, yeah.  They touch the thighs, the ass, the back.  I mean, there's plenty more sensual areas on a woman's body.  Katie.  Than just...  Mr. Jew, you're here.  Happy thought.  Happy thought.  I'm going to take a little rice powder and stick a pooper.  It feels very good.  There you go. 
[00:33:30]  Now I grab just a little nipple and I put a little pee-pee on it.  Feel good.  Feel good.  That's good.  You are right, girl.  I don't know.  What are you doing?  I do an ancient Chinese tongue massage, which is very relaxing.  I don't know if I should be doing it.  No, no. 
[00:34:00]  Very ancient Chinese secret.  I put my face right there.  Oh, I don't...  Yeah, it feels funny.  I'm a heinie.  That's good.  And then you reek a duck sauce.  Katie.  Yeah?  If Mr. Jew went for this move on you, what would you do?  It depends on what part of him says.  At the very end, hey, you know?  Oh, you're kind of feeling into it.  Oh, you're kind of feeling into it at the end of the massage?  Well, it also depends on what Mr. Jew looks like. 
[00:34:30]  But you get the women, so it's kind of hot.  No, you haven't seen the women that massages me.  What, are they like Helga and stuff?  Yeah.  Big, uh...  She's a big girl.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Katie.  That's my little tablum.  Big fat arm.  Give me a massage.  Guys, but Brewer, we were saying, like, if we went for a massage at a legitimate place,  guys, right?  And there was a woman massaging you and she went for that move, you're not running and  telling the people at the front desk.  No. 
[00:35:00]  That's something totally different.  I can't think of one guy out there that would run and say, oh my God, you're touching me  in my dirty area.  Yeah.  You tell your friends.  Yeah.  Pete, meet me around the block real quick.  What's going on?  Just meet me.  I've got to tell you something.  Right.  Dude, you've got to go to this massage place.  I went in there.  Just a chick starts feeling up my yam bag.  Get the ass out of here.  Ask for Ingram.  Dude, is she fat?  Ask for Mr. Jew.  No.  Mr. Jew touched me. 
[00:35:30]  He touched me.  Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  He's a Chinese guy.  Brewer said he has a story, though.  He has a rabbi, Mr. Chang.  Man, my first massage ever.  Yeah.  True story.  I was in Colorado.  How old?  Sad to say, like two years ago.  Really?  It's way too gay.  Yeah.  It's way too gay.  I don't need someone touching me like that.  It's just funky.  Yeah.  Well, we go to this guy and the guy's going to do it.  Ah.  So I'm instantly like, ah, ah, he's like, ah, it's the best thing ever. 
[00:36:00]  He's married.  But it's man hands.  But you know when someone's married, but you're still just not sure.  You think once in a while, this guy gets drunk, doesn't show off, and then Rick Golgata.  Rick, you meet his own friend that's way off in left field.  Rick.  Gets on all four.  Rick.  No, I know he's good at baseball, but you know, he walks funny.  You know what I mean?  Well, this guy, I go to the room, and I don't know if you're supposed to keep your underwear 
[00:36:30]  or anything like that.  And he said, ah, you've got to do it all nude.  What?  The guy is saying this?  Yeah, but like a dick.  I was like, all right, this is the way he's supposed to be.  I don't want to be a dick and not listen, and I'm a dick.  So I hear like having your background.  So I lay down.  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  He doesn't have a sheet on me.  And then when I...  Wait, you're laying down completely naked. 
[00:37:00]  What did this guy talk you into?  So, dude, it gets worse.  I had to stare at it.  Eat it.  I'm so embarrassed.  So now I go to yourself.  You know, he starts massaging.  And he's getting too close to my ass cheek.  Oh, no.  So I'm instantly like...  Wait a minute.  F you, man.  Did you feel all awkward and crap?  You're laying on your back completely naked?  You have no clue.  You're back.  First of all, you can't sit on your back or on your belly. 
[00:37:30]  No, right now I'm on my belly.  Oh, all right.  So I'm like, all right.  He starts massaging back.  I'm like, all right.  Okay.  I got it.  I'm secure enough in my masculinity.  I still can't relax.  Of course not.  I got audio of Jim.  I think the second I started...  The second I started getting relaxed, you started, like, doing the legs.  And I got a little close to my ass cheek.  And I went...  So I went, listen.  Yeah, I don't know if this was cool.  I don't know if I should... 
[00:38:00]  It's like you're trying out gay sex the first time.  Look, man.  I don't think this is cool anymore.  Look, I tried it.  Keep the money.  Listen, I made a mistake.  I took you an hour out of your time.  The funny part is you're still trying to be nice about it.  Right.  Look, man.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You don't know.  You feel weird.  What am I going to do?  Just punch him?  What am I going to do?  It is.  It's like Jim's telling us his rape story.  Yeah.  So then...  Here, let me massage you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You know, I felt the gun, so I knew it was armed, and I just figured I had to. 
[00:38:30]  It's the worst, because you've got this faggy music.  Water journey, Jim.  Water journey.  So this is where it got really bad.  Uh-oh.  It gets worse?  He talks to me.  He's like, listen, listen, listen.  No, no, no.  Oh, he talks in.  He talks in.  And I go back.  Give me a D.  Give me.  Give me an I.  Give me a C.  C.  Good, you can't.  What you got? 
[00:39:00]  Me.  Nice head dick.  So I get talked back into, all right, I should relax, Mova.  But did you get up at any point?  Yeah, that's when I got up.  And he's like, no, no, no.  Wait, now you get up, and you're naked?  You're naked.  Yeah, and I grab my shirt.  All right, you grab your shirt to cover up.  Dude, wait a minute.  Now, oh, my God, I'm having a horrible flashback.  Now that I think about it, I gave him a hummer.  Yeah.  Holy Christ.  What happened?  Oh, man.  See, the joke's on him, because I'm not gay. 
[00:39:30]  It's at bed and breakfast.  First of all, I was at a bed and breakfast.  So it's in the dude's house.  Oh, no.  And now that I remember, I'm in this dude's bedroom.  You know, as soon as I woke up, I'm like, oh, the bedroom?  I took out of the breakfast.  Yes.  I've already given the cash.  Were you on his bed?  No, no, no.  Oh, that would be homo.  But it was right next.  It was easily influencing.  Right.  We want to lay on the bed. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  And I got audio of Brewer's massage therapist.  Oh, here we go.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  Did you ever play, doggie?  That's when I sniff her ass and she just growls.  It's my father's house.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So it's in the guy's house.  Why did you go on some kind of a wacky bed and breakfast vacation?  Me and my wife were like, let's just go to Colorado. 
[00:40:30]  But don't you like getting up and scratching yourself and being able to walk naked to the fridge or something?  All right, hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm starting to breathe again.  I haven't left that hard since the last time Brewer was in.  Well, it's a true story.  I feel like a dick, buddy.  I want to help all fellow male guys going from massage.  I lost something in the translation, though.  So you're naked trying to leave.  You're trying to leave still.  This guy's...  No, but you were up and you were leaving as you're naked, getting your clothes. 
[00:41:00]  And then he talked you back into...  Talked me back.  That's smooth, man.  Listen, you just never have...  I said, no, man, I didn't think it was like this.  And he went, oh, no, it's cool.  It's like a massage, but I'll tell you what.  I'll do your wife first.  Oh, man.  This guy says, I'll do the wife first.  And I'm like, well...  She was the appetizer.  I don't know.  He's like, trust me.  And now you know if he's touching your ass like that, he's going to be all over your wife's  ass.  Exactly.  Because he's bi.  We don't need...  See? 
[00:41:30]  He doesn't care what it is as long as it's flesh under his hands.  So, like a dick, I find, like, all right, maybe I'm overreacting.  Maybe.  Maybe.  My instinct is going, get out!  Dick!  How many times do I have to tell you?  Here's God.  Right to Brewer.  Brewer.  Man, touch your ass.  Door.  Two feet away.  Goodbye!  Goodbye!  And I got the evil other side going, oh, it's just a massage, Jim. 
[00:42:00]  You're overreacting.  Faggot.  Faggot.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Your balls are showing.  So now, all right, you were up, he talked you back into it, now you lay back down on  your belly.  I lay back on my belly.  It's funny now, talking about it, but I'm like, dang, this is horrible.  That's awful.  I'm going to sue this guy, man.  Yeah, you should. 
[00:42:30]  So anyway, here's what I'm saying.  Was it Mr. Jew?  I go back down.  I'm laying belly down.  Yeah.  He starts again, and he goes, oh, man, dude, he's doing my feet.  Whatever, whatever.  He's doing my feet.  Now he goes, okay.  Marcel is Wallace through a...  Tell me he told you to turn over.  Tony Rocky Horror out the window for touching his wife's feet.  He told me to turn over.  Get out of here!  Stop it!  You're laying there, you're buck naked on your belly, and then he goes... 
[00:43:00]  I swear to God.  That's a winner!  When does he tell you...  Talk about one of the most humiliating times, as you, as a man, turn around to another guy.  Wait a minute.  This guy's going to see my donkey.  This guy's going to see my donkey.  There you go.  Turn around, there it is.  Wait, you did it?  How's that for a topper?  Okay, Jim Brewer. 
[00:43:30]  Turn over now.  I'm going to do the sit-on-you massage, it's called.  You did it?  I turn around, and then I grab my shirt.  Yeah.  And he goes, what are you doing?  What?  And I went, you know what?  You're on a date, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a date that's going wrong.  This is not cool.  Right.  I go, listen, I'm sorry, I just can't.  I go down.  Now it's like, me and my wife are stuck in this house. 
[00:44:00]  For how long?  You know what I mean?  Like, we're in the middle of vacation time.  We can't get anywhere.  We're, like, hundreds of miles of the next cabin.  We're in the middle of the...  And you're with the guy that was rubbing your ass and wanted to see your donkey.  He's like, don't forget, in the morning we have French toast with strawberries and donuts.  Oh!  Go pick out raspberries for us, and...  Dude, what a faggot vacation.  Come on!  I've done the, uh, the, uh, what is it called?  The, uh, the...  Bed and breakfast?  Yeah, I've done the bed and breakfast.  They're cool.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I didn't get the free massage. 
[00:44:30]  I don't want to live with someone on my vacation.  I want to go to a hotel.  I want to be alone with my chick in a room.  Period.  Well, you learn.  I want to be able to wake...  I want to be able to slam heads against a headboard.  I want to be able to wake up after you're done, walk into the bathroom,  take care of whatever you've got to do, pop the minibar open.  I don't want to deal with Mrs. Kravitz coming downstairs,  seeing me bent over the fridge looking at my brown eyes.  You know what I mean?  Now I know how to chick's feel.  There are some normal bed and breakfast places out there.  Right.  Jim went to a bad house. 
[00:45:00]  Plato's retreat.  Wow.  All right, we have to take a break.  Wow, bro.  The phones have exploded.  People have massage stories.  One guy, I used to do massages.  Every woman thought I was gay.  See?  We got to talk to him back.  Like guys aren't getting off on touching hot girls playing.  They're naked.  I got one thing to say.  When you ever massage a chick, where does it always lead to?  Sex.  At least an attempt.  Right.  It did with that guy and you.  Aunt's stepdad is on the phone. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, really?  We're just a kid.  We'll talk to Sal next as well.  Aunt's mommy went to this place that had the Jew guy, you know, messing with the women.  I'm wondering if my mommy went to this guy.  Your mom is hot.  She went to this massage place that all these allegations are about.  We're trying to get her on the phone.  Did she come back happy?  She probably did.  She could use the digits.  Your stepdad's listening to that.  It don't matter.  Anything that keeps her happy, if you don't have to do anything, he's happy.  It don't matter.  Where's your mom drink? 
[00:46:00]  Everything.  Everything.  She likes wine and she likes, if she's really getting crazy.  We should hook her up with my mom after like two, three martinis.  Oh, yeah.  Imagine those two.  Yeah.  Did you hear her aunt's mom saying?  Out of control.  Yes.  Okay, you heard that.  Brutal.  I loved it.  Let's take a break.  All right, man.  Pure genius.  If you're on hold, you're on hold because we want to get to all of you guys, so please  stay right there.  All the news you need to know and moves.  This is W.O.W.

[00:49:00]  Yeah.  What's your deal today?  Hey, not so much.  I'm in the house of the day, so I wanted to come by and go out to you guys today.  Hey.  Wow, that's nice of you.  How old are you?  18.  Come right down.  And how big are your boobies?  36.  Yeah, double day.  Oh, come on down.  How about that?  Security will let you right through.  No questions asked.  Great.  How close are you to the studio?  I'm at 60th and 5th. 
[00:49:30]  All right, you're close.  Oh, you're real close.  Yeah.  Can we put your picture up on the web so everyone can check out your lovely boobies?  We'll leave your face out of it.  The face doesn't really matter.  If you don't want it up there.  Take your shirt off.  Go with your knockers.  All right, Becky.  Get down here, okay?  I don't know.  You have to tell me where you're going.  You have to tell me how to get there.  Oh, hold on.  Someone will be right with you.  I think he would love to help you.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  I'll come and get you. 
[00:50:00]  It is Whip-em-Out Wednesday.  Write wow in the back of your car, and ladies like Becky will wow you.  Yeah.  If they see the wow, it works like a charm every week.  We love the live wows down here in the studio.  It's all too rare.  All right.  We got a bunch of massage therapists checking in.  Oh, yeah?  Let's start with Taryn.  Taryn.  Hi.  How are you guys?  Hey.  Oh, listen to your voice.  What's up?  I'm right in your hometown, Huntington.  Just relax.  Just relax, Jim.  I'm getting quite a kick out of that Jim Brewer story. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  That Brewer story gets even better.  Oh, man.  I can only imagine.  He left out a little bit of it.  He left out the...  I didn't want to tell him the right part of it, man.  He left out the...  The guy tried to mangle my wife, rub his donkey.  He left out the jacuzzi part of the story.  I couldn't tell him that part first.  Jim Brewer on Temptation Island.  It's stories like these that my husband hates when I go to work. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  So, well, first of all, you massage in Huntington?  Yes.  Which place?  Natural Care Chiropractic.  Oh, yeah.  Chiropractic.  It's right in the village, right by...  Tell Dr. Sal I said hi.  You know him.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  He's giving me a few adjustments.  Yes, he's very good.  I can't believe you've been in our office.  How many times?  Cool.  I had a pretty serious neck problem.  Oh, yeah?  I'm actually going to be there very soon for a lower back problem.  Okay.  We'll make sure...  That I plan on getting next week. 
[00:51:30]  No.  No, I'm dead serious.  So, what did you have to add to this?  No, I'm just laughing at, you know, Jim Brewer's story, and now I know why my husband, or should  I say ex-husband, hates when I work as a massage therapist.  Oh, now look, you massage guys, right?  Yes.  And how close do you get to any vitals, front or back?  Oh, well, the important stick shift, shall we say, is always covered.  Always covered, see?  Always covered.  And when you do the butt, how close do you get to ground zero back there? 
[00:52:00]  Well, we fold the towel back to just about the, how should you say, the midline.  See, Brewer, you're not laying out there in the breeze.  In a guy's bedroom.  How many drinks did he have before he went in there?  How many drinks did he have?  I found out eventually.  Were you buzzed a little?  Oh, no way.  Oh, really?  No, because then I'd have gone the whole way.  I was thinking about it.  Then I don't know what I would have done.  Let me take a walk before I go in.  The question is, did he get really relaxed? 
[00:52:30]  Well, no way.  Okay.  Is he right to the occasion?  Holds it in his mouth for a second.  I don't know.  She wants to know if you arose to the occasion.  There, Jim.  Anything going on?  Oh, God.  Hell no.  You didn't pop it into gear.  It came out the poop snout.  That's how violated I felt.  I was walking in my room.  Maybe we'll see you in the office sometime.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, take care.  There she goes.  That's funny.  Can you tell the jacuzzi part?  Because we figured out your whole bed and breakfast vacation. 
[00:53:00]  So what happened was, we got in there the night before.  Me and my wife, love it.  We fly in this little plane over the mountains.  It's beautiful.  We're going to the white something out there.  The white somethings.  Yeah.  Whatever they are.  You're going to see Grizzly.  It's a great time for Grizzly.  So we're all excited.  So you're in the woods or something?  Yeah, we're in the middle of pretty much nowhere.  We get to these people's house.  Oh, man.  This makes it worse.  The dude looked like...  Who's that?  The illusion guy.  Remember the illusion? 
[00:53:30]  It's all an illusion.  Doug Henning.  Yes!  Doug Henning?  Yes!  Magician Doug Henning?  Yes!  Doug Henning touched your brewer's junk.  You look like Doug Henning, which made it worse.  The world of magic.  You have to know you look like a banana.  Yeah, he looks like Bugs Bunny.  Exactly.  Doug Henning, yeah.  So he's like, we're going to go in the jacuzzi.  You guys go in the jacuzzi.  Me and my wife will meet you in there.  And me and my wife are like, oh, this is awesome.  The stars.  This is nuts.  And all of a sudden, he comes out. 
[00:54:00]  Don't make me laugh too hard, please.  And he goes, hey, listen, my wife is illusioning.  She don't feel good.  Apparently, it's an illusion.  So anyway, he gets in.  And all of a sudden, I see my wife's eyes like, boing, bang.  Like, dude, it smacked your eyes.  She's like, um, I don't need a foot massage.  I go, I'm not massaging your foot.  She's like, I know.  Oh, no.  The guy started massaging.  Yeah, and he goes, you guys should really, really, I mean, you from New York City should 
[00:54:30]  learn to relax.  You really should have a massage tomorrow.  I have one open at 10.  I want it at 11.  I'm telling you, massage.  So she goes, why don't you massage Jim's feet?  Because he has really bad feet.  She was totally mortified by this.  And I go, nah, I'm cool, man.  I'm good.  I'm good.  So he goes, no, but seriously, you know, you guys should relax.  I should have known that was the first clue of him going, I want to get inside you.  I want to have you like an animal.  I'll show you an illusion. 
[00:55:00]  Set up the massage table in my bedroom.  What?  Watch this disappear.  So am I supposed to be...  Hey, man.  First of all, did...  Hey, man.  You said...  Ow.  This thing called that.  Ow.  Did it suck just that he came in?  Ow.  Don't punch me in the kidney, dick.  What are you...  Ow.  Ow.  Come in here.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow. 
[00:55:30]  Ow.  Stop it, man.  You were hanging...  Just relax.  You were hanging with a couple swingers.  Swingers.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  They got a nice scam going.  But the whole time...  It's bed and breakfast.  You know, most of the people probably don't go for it, but the 10% that do, they're having  a grand all time.  Until you're confronted with that, and you're not...  I can see...  He might have caught me off guard if I was really high and drunk, and you know what I mean?  You're a little off guard, and his...  I can see them, but we were like straight-laced, and this guy can't...  Thank God.  Thank God. 
[00:56:00]  Because even when it's happening in front of you going, you're too much in shock.  Right.  You're in shock.  You're like, yo, this guy's massaging my chick's feet, and I can pounce him.  Right, yeah.  Because he weighs like 50 pounds.  Like, you know what?  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.  See?  The benefit of the doubt.  Where are we going to go?  It's 11, 12 at night.  Where are we going to go?  You're screwed.  Oh, dude.  Now to think about that.  You took a little plane there.  He was trying to work his magic.  That's funny.  Oh, man.  You thought there'd be some hot tub action.  Next day, there I am. 
[00:56:30]  Turn over.  Hey, Will, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  You guys are great.  Thank you, Will.  What I was going to say was that I had a girlfriend.  I was dating this chick, and I wanted to do something special for her.  So I told her, I said, you know, you really need to get a massage, and there's a nice spa down the road.  You know, I'll get you there.  And she was like, no, I don't want to do that. 
[00:57:00]  I'm like, why?  I mean, spa, you know, it's great.  You get a massage and all that.  She's like, oh, I used to work there.  And I was like, oh, really?  She was like, yeah.  And guys used to pay me to, you know, so I shampoo them, you know what I mean?  Oh, what?  Like totally.  So she would have sex with her clients, basically.  Yeah.  And they would pay her to do that kind of stuff because that's what she was doing.  Why did your girlfriend feel that was a great time to tell you she was a hooker? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, really?  Because that's pretty much it.  Let me tell you, it didn't last much longer after that.  It's paying for my school.  What's up?  Yeah, I'm just paying for school.  I'm just paying for school.  So it's a done, no more donkeys.  Hey, Will.  Meanwhile, fast forward, you look like Sandy Kane.  Twado.  Yeah.  Twado rolls.  Hey, Will.  Yeah.  You seen the wow signs in Cleveland yet or what?  No, dude.  I am looking for them all over.  You got one.  You got one.  Hey.  I love that word. 
[00:58:00]  But we can't use it here on the air.  I'm going to, like, marker it on the back of my car.  All right.  Well, let us know if you start seeing the wows in Cleveland.  We're very interested.  Yeah.  Where do I get the stickers at?  Well, you got to ask the radio station.  We like the homemade ones, though.  So put a homemade one on until, you know, they figure it out.  Okay?  All right.  I will.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Will from Cleveland.  Very cool.  There's a couple of funny ones here.  Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:58:30]  With these parlors here, as soon as you walk in, they tell you, lay down.  They wash you with a big brush like a 67 Buick.  Yep.  And then, once they start rubbing your back, they could turn the switch on like that.  Once they go to the small of the back and they drag the pinky, it's all over.  You could sign your bank account to them.  What?  They'll have you do anything.  Whistle a dixie.  You could wiggle your ears.  You're under their power.  See, that's the guy getting a massage from a girl, though.  Yeah.  You turn that around and they're out by the front desk. 
[00:59:00]  He touched me.  Bro, I heard Marco's your favorite fan now.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Bye.  Aaron, what's going on?  What's up, man?  How you guys doing today?  Pretty good.  I just wanted to tell Jim not to worry because he's not as much of a fag as he thinks he is.  At least he didn't get a hummer from a transvestite like Norton did.  I thought Norton, I thought they'd forget that story you told the other night.  Yeah, that's a forgettable story.  I knew that Judgment told me, don't mention this on O&A, and I did. 
[00:59:30]  No, they'll forget.  They'll never forget.  So what happened?  Two years from now, they wouldn't even bring it up.  No, yeah, we can talk about it.  I was getting treats from a lady of the evening, and her back was a lot larger than it should  have been.  And I was rubbing it.  And I realized it was not a lady, and I lost my rod, and it was awful, and the breath on  it was horrible.  That's true.  My buddy Tyler's at my house.  I'm in the bathroom.  Oh, I can't do that.  It's good, but they'll dump out of that, unfortunately.  I was watching the foul breath off of the area, and my buddy's knocking on the door. 
[01:00:00]  He's going, dude, how was it?  And I'm like, that was stupid, man.  You know, we talked and stuff.  What did you just like have, like man breath and old spice on there?  There was no old spice, no, but it was just, I was having cyber sex one time, and I realized  I was talking to a guy, and I got him to admit it.  He was just talking like a man.  You could just sense it.  Oh, the cyber sex. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Kelly, are you?  Oh, go ahead, bro.  Jim, have you tried weed?  I used to.  If I was high, I never would have noticed a big back, so I'm glad I was so.  Yeah, right?  Hey, Kelly.  Yes.  How are you?  Good.  Yeah, what's up?  Well, I paid, just yesterday, I had gone last week to go to Atlantic City, won a load of  money, so I wanted to do something good for my husband.  Okay.  So, I have this friend of mine who works at a real nice salon, and she said, get him a 
[01:01:00]  massage.  It'll be great.  He'll love it.  So, I made an appointment, I took him down, and I'm like, oh, it's on me.  I told the receptionist, I'll pay for it.  So, I'm sitting there, and as I'm waiting, I'm thinking, man, I just paid another  woman to touch my husband.  Right.  So, when he comes out, I said, how was he?  He said, oh, it was great.  He goes, it was just like the ones you used to give me before we got married.  Uh-oh.  Right.  So, I said, wait, did you get wood?  You know, and he's like, no, no, no, none of that, no, no, no. 
[01:01:30]  But then he tells me, as we're driving down the road, he's like, yeah, well, when I went  in, she did tell me that I could get naked, or, you know, whatever I wanted to do.  Really?  I was like, never mind, I don't want to talk about it.  Whatever I just paid that woman to do, I don't want to know.  And it was a high-end place?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a very, very nice place.  Interesting.  And, you know, I was like, and he swears, he says, I didn't, you know, he says, there's 
[01:02:00]  nothing sexual.  I said, well, did you massage your butt?  Nope, nope, nope.  He said, no.  Yeah.  I bet.  I don't think he's telling you everything.  Like I said, I don't, he's in the other room listening to the radio.  I'm like, I don't want to know.  All right.  Thank you, Kelly.  You're welcome.  All right, bye.  People can't get over the Brewer story.  Brewer's fellating the microphone.  I know.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Brewer, man, when you were a kid, how many times did you have to put your hand on the  stove before you realized it was hot?  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Guys, there were more flags going up than on the UN building.  What's the matter with you?  I agree, man.  I was caught off guard, man.  One more thing.  Yeah, one more thing.  Yeah.  Norton, I believe you lost the rod, but it was after completion.  Don't lie.  Dude, if I completed, I would have admitted, I wish I had, because it was fantastic.  Hold on.  A skilled technician was this fella.  Andrew.  Yeah, what's up, boss?  We're hanging with Jim Brewer and Jim Norton in the studio today. 
[01:03:00]  So, Jim, I was going to give a shout-out for my boyfriend, Rich Tom.  I love him.  And besides, I got a complaint.  Baggy.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, easy there.  Say some things.  Bye-bye.  Say some things.  I got a complaint.  Bye-bye.  I got a complaint about the show.  Here we go.  Me and I.  What?  Hello?  Are you listening?  I got a complaint about the show.  Go.  He says, I just love Brewer.  Every time I call.  Playing anywhere soon.  And then, what, he's saying something completely different now.  All right, whatever.  Like, he uses fake things to try to get on the show. 
[01:03:30]  And, no, won't be entertained.  Bye-bye.  Ta-ra-ra-bums, yay.  Ta-ra-ra-bums, yay.  Steve, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thanks, dude.  You're up.  That means now.  All right, all right, all right.  Steve.  Oh, cool.  Guys, what's up?  Listen, I was in a massage par that got busted.  I was butt naked on the table.  Swap team came kicking in the door, yelling and screaming.  Everybody down on the floor, all that.  I look up.  There's an MP5, like, three inches from my head. 
[01:04:00]  Get out of here.  I kid you.  Dude, who would make something like that up?  What kind of massages were they giving that they had to bring out the heavy artillery?  Swap team, get out of here.  Coming out of the closet.  Swap team, get out of here.  Swap team, get out of here.  I was only here for 10 minutes.  I don't know what I was in for.  Swap team, nine, nine, nine.  Christopher, welcome.  Swap team, get out of here.  Swap team, get out of here.  Swap team, get out of here.  The girl that was doing it, she jumped, like, immediately to the floor, got in the fetal position,  and the guy standing there was like, oh, you've done this before.  I mean, I'm lying there trying to play stupid. 
[01:04:30]  I'm like, oh, what do you mean?  I was fixing the air conditioning.  Was it one of these places that you knew you were going to get some action, or what?  Well, I knew I was going to get a little something, but I didn't tell them that.  Right.  Did you get arrested?  No, I was able to talk my way out of it.  But they took, like, all the girls, the house, madam, whoever.  They had, like, inflatable beds in the one room.  It's like 20-something people that lived in this little office.  Right, right.  And they had, like, separate rooms with the beds on them, all the little Asian stuff hanging 
[01:05:00]  on the wall.  What was the mortgage payment?  Yeah, I know.  Thank you, Jesus Christ.  All right.  That's enough.  That's enough.  People just want to mess with you.  I know.  I don't care, man.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Girl, what?  When you were getting your massage, did you start to, you know, raise your butt, like,  trying looking for the tuchus lingus?  Like the guy on Sex in the City?  See, now, if we were, like, 17, I'd be like, yeah, I was raising it because of your mother. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Sure you were.  Nice-head, faggot.  Gang-yang party.  Gang-yang party.  Thank you.  Faggot.  One more, and we'll move on here.  There was a good one on, uh, let's see what Kevin has.  Kevin, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  That's another story about a massage parlor.  We were all down in New Orleans, uh, drinking and partying one night, and, uh, we ended up  going to this place called the Bangkok Spa.  Uh, we should have known by the name that something was up.  So, uh, the girls, you know, they start, you know, they wash you down, they start massaging 
[01:06:00]  you, and halfway through the massage, they hand you a price list.  Oh, that's amazing.  And the price list has all the real names of the sex favors and the prices.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and it was very interesting.  I mean, the Bangkok Spa, you know something's weird.  And, uh, they actually give you a menu, like you're, like you're eating a friggin' dinner.  How much?  They actually give you a menu with all the names and how much it costs.  How much for a handy?  Uh, 25.  How much for a Hummer?  Uh, 45. 
[01:06:30]  Wow, you gotta go for the Hummer.  Yeah, $20 more, you're right.  It's only $20.  That's like a round of beers.  Nice.  Dude, if you're in a rush, do they have a drive-thru window or a girl just queefing your face for $3?  They actually have them all sitting in the room, and you get to pick which one you want.  Are they any good?  Uh, they, no.  Every show I've ever seen, you watch those shows, Real Sex and stuff on HBO, and they take you inside these places.  In the movies, when you, they, uh, take, you know, the guys in, and, uh, there's a girl that you get to choose from, they're so hot. 
[01:07:00]  And they're in these little skimpy things, beautiful.  In real life, when you're watching Real Sex and they show you the girls you have to choose from, big, fat, cellulite, uh, homeless people.  Yeah.  That's what you get to choose from.  Awful.  I had a skinny Asian, though.  I didn't have a fat girl, but she was just so unhappy.  With a big back?  No, she was, no, not that one, no.  This was another one.  She was awful, too.  Skinny Asian?  Yeah, she was very unhappy.  I didn't see one skinny one in there. 
[01:07:30]  We have a whole theory with the Asian ladies in America.  There's a whole system that, uh, we don't really know about.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, there's a hierarchy of employment.  They're called slaves?  Well, they come to America and they start in the massage parlors.  And then they work their...  Yankee Cranky.  Yankee Cranky.  And then they work their way up to what?  Like, the nail place.  Nail places, if they're good.  If they work the Yankee Cranky good enough, uh, they work their way up to the nail joints.  Right.  And then they get to, oh, no, pay the cure.  You know, they get to do the nail thing.  And then if they do good there, then they get to work in the sushi restaurant. 
[01:08:00]  Ah, sure.  But don't F up.  Because you screw up in the sushi place, you don't go back down to nails.  Nope.  You go right back to Yankee Cranky.  But there's dry cleaning in there as well.  Right.  Dry cleaning.  I think dry cleaning was...  Takey outie.  Huh?  Takey outie.  Takey outie.  Happy ending?  You want the happy ending?  I have the number four.  That's what it is.  Yankee Cranky.  Laundry.  Nail place.  Sushi.  Screw up sushi.  Right back to Yankee Cranky.  Which is in the basement of the sushi restaurant.  Of the sushi place.  Paul, what's up? 
[01:08:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, man.  My wife, a few months ago, she wanted to do something nice for my birthday and everything.  She didn't tell me what was coming up.  And, well, one day this guy comes to their house, to their apartment, right?  And with a massage table.  Uh-huh.  And...  Guy came to his house, Opie, with a massage table.  And who...  I mean, my guy, I mean, was terrible.  Was terrible.  I was...  I couldn't believe it.  And...  We always take one call, two minutes. 
[01:09:00]  Sir, did you bomb a marine barracks?  Thank you, Paul.  Always take one too many.  See what happens?  You're right.  We should take a break.  We'll move on to other things.  But we've got to play Tourette's Whorehouse, Anthony, after this discussion.  Right.  Love the Tourette's Whorehouse.  Who doesn't?  Guy with Tourette's.  He was going to Vegas.  He wanted to go to one of these whorehouses.  And he was asking some questions.  Call them up.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the...  The Nevada area.  Uh-huh. 
[01:09:30]  In about a...  A week?  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's Syndrome.  Mm-hmm.  Which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party. 
[01:10:00]  A hundred...  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the ladies are independent contractors.  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  can get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay? 
[01:11:00]  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take...  Mastercard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  Work your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but... 
[01:11:30]  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  High up...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?

You've got to be in it to win it, though.  Yeah, put your wow on your vehicle.  You will see some lovely, lovely breasts.  That's right.  Just right wow in the back of your car.  Laura, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Pretty good. 
[01:14:00]  I love you guys.  Well, we love you.  I'm from East Northport.  Oh, cool.  How about that?  So, okay, I have a good wow story.  Okay.  My boyfriend and I are just coming out of the tunnel and we're driving down 34th and we're  stopped at a red light next to these four guys, you know, good looking, nice car.  Anyway, so they have a sign, you know, a wow sticker, but it's like makeshift.  They're holding it up in the windshield, beeping at this girl.  She turns around, it gives them the finger.  Bitch.  And they get all upset, so I took the liberty of doing it for her. 
[01:14:30]  Look at that.  She got the rebound.  You did the rebound wow.  I did.  Now that's in a moment.  They were pleased.  Hey, Laura, thanks for helping us out with that.  No problem.  We appreciate it.  Damn right.  The boyfriend must have been happy.  She's smiling as we speak.  We're angry rapists and you just angry wow them.  Two things really fast.  Don't force the ladies to do the wow.  There's plenty like Laura that'll just do it because they feel like it, okay?  Yeah.  And don't harass the ladies.  Thank you, Laura.  We're weird. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  Speaking of Whipping Out Wednesday, we have Becky with her huge cans or boobs or...  Yeah, what is this all about?  The lovely Becky has come down to our studios.  She just happened to be in the city and she wanted to flash us.  Becky, how you doing?  Hi.  Wow, look at that.  Hey.  18 years old.  Look at that.  Hey, what's up?  And where are you from?  Rockland County.  Rockland County.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, look at the nuns going like, oh, oh, but... 
[01:15:30]  Norton's like, yeah, nice, nice, nice.  Really hot.  Can we get your boobs on the internet?  Yeah.  Just not your face?  Yeah.  All right.  That's fine with us, right?  Yeah.  Well, Becky...  Does anybody tell you you look like a celebrity or anything?  No.  No?  What?  No, not at all.  I was just thinking.  She's almost got kind of a jewel thing going on, right?  Oh, yeah, a little jewel.  Sure.  I've never heard that before, but okay.  Yeah, now you're dead.  Jewel broke the nose. 
[01:16:00]  What?  What are you doing, Rick?  All right.  Becky, we'd love to see your boobs.  That was good, Alfie.  Can you stand up?  Whoa.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, you got a nice body.  Oh.  Wow.  Those are 18-year-old boobs.  That is, um...  Yeah, those are 18-year-old girl boobs right there.  Oh, Becky, come over here for a second.  I got to get a...  You got to get a close look.  I never ask for the close look. 
[01:16:30]  You're going to do it.  Yeah, this is a tribute to you because most times we don't get the second one.  Wow.  Look at you.  Very little tan line.  See, that is like what...  No one's going to know what to do with that to, like, 25.  Well, her boyfriend's right out there ruining the whole fantasy.  Peeking in.  Get back on the mic there, Becky.  That is what boobs should look like in a weightless environment.  Those are one of the nicest set of breasts I've ever seen.  Yeah.  I mean that.  One of the nicest sets of breasts I've ever seen.  Be careful. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, Rick, did you get a picture of that?  Yeah.  Get that.  Is Steve here hoping?  God, be very careful.  We should get many angles of those boobs.  Why didn't you enter our best boob contest?  Because I've got to tell you, you would have won.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  I didn't...  I looked around here, you know.  The best boob contest, too, is on the way.  You would have won that.  Why?  I'll come down for that.  I think she would have won.  Yeah.  Those are really nice.  They're like...  They're big, yet they are so pert.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Yes.  Yeah.  Firm and heavy and lovely. 
[01:17:30]  Rick doesn't even have anything.  Like, there's no batteries in a camera.  Rick's just like, you want to do it again?  But did you hear her attitude?  Can we see him again?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Come right up.  Can I tell you something, Anthony?  Yes, help me out here.  I think she needs to take this shirt completely off so her hands are down to her side so we  can get some nice pictures to get her hair.  That's a good idea.  Okay.  What do you think, Becky?  Yeah, of course.  What a trooper.  And I think we should all take our pants off.  Just to make you feel more comfortable.  Just watch your step on the way out. 
[01:18:00]  Let's just pretend we're at the bathhouse with Jim Brewer's...  Oh, with Jim Brewer.  Wow, look at that.  See?  You're a dick.  Rick, you're getting many angles, I hope.  You should get the side angle.  Yeah, I'll do that.  That's a good look, though, with the jeans and your hands or your thumbs in your pockets.  She's just hanging out without a shirt on.  And she's got the pierced belly button, Anthony.  Yeah.  See, in this show, we don't mind getting 18-year-olds naked.  Yeah.  Jesus.  None of us have daughters your age. 
[01:18:30]  That's the age where you just suck face.  Three hours licking each other.  You're already been feeling down there.  Not only that, but you don't get to rub that on the outside of the shirt.  Becky, man.  That's all you needed.  Damn, those are...  That's all you needed.  Solid.  Wow.  Look at that wee.  The little tan lines.  Nice.  You do a lot of making out there, Becky? 
[01:19:00]  Don't touch her yet.  Don't touch her yet.  Oh, God.  Rick's getting the side angle now.  Can I just smell your boyfriend's mule?  Such a mess.  I love it.  He's kind of a bigger fan of you guys than I am.  Huh?  He's a huge fan of you guys.  Obviously, if he's letting you come down.  Hey, Brad, come on.  Joe, you're knockers.  His roommate's here from Tahoe for the first time in New York. 
[01:19:30]  Show them gorillas.  What happened?  His roommate's here from Tahoe for the first time in New York, so he's getting a great experience.  Yeah.  Has he ever seen you topless?  Yeah.  Oh, he has?  How's that?  How did that happen?  Drunk something.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Drunk something.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Not like that.  Okay.  We always try to get every story in detail.  I need someone like you around my house.  You ever catch him smelling your shoes and beating off?  Oh, drunk.  No, not yet. 
[01:20:00]  Not yet.  He's rolling around angrily on the floor.  Should we ask intern Rachel what she thinks of the fine boobs?  Rachel.  I mean, Rachel had to fill up the ugly man boobs the last two weeks.  Oh, yeah.  Rachel, how would you rate those?  It could be a treat.  How do you rate those?  Well, first of all, I think she's beautiful.  I think you're just gorgeous.  But, um...  Yeah.  Rachel, you're, you know, you guys have got about the same size, I believe.  Yeah, look at that.  I'm not wearing a tank top.  Yeah, that's a tank.  Yeah, I don't like.  Hey, Becky, would you mind if Rachel just, you know, copped a feel? 
[01:20:30]  I don't know if I'm as good as that.  You know, ugly guy with the...  Well, that's why.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure you'll just...  No, you're fine.  You're fine.  Yeah, you want to...  It's refreshing.  All right, Rachel, if you will, cop a little feel there.  Nice.  Oh.  Are they nice, natural, right?  How loud was that seat?  All right.  Bro is speechless.  Look, I've never done this before, but I'm just going to start cranking out a badge right now. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  That was so hot.  It took no one that long to just say that.  That was so hot.  He's just been staring, blinking repeatedly.  Something happened with the...  No, those are just like...  They're really nice.  It's pleasantly plump and just supple.  Very natural.  Those are totally natural, too.  It's really rare that you see...  Becky, would you like to touch Rachel?  Well, I'm not taking off my shirt. 
[01:21:30]  No, you don't have to.  Threw the clothes there.  You can touch me.  I don't care.  I have no problem with that.  That was kind of weak.  Yeah.  Yeah, get in there.  Palm it.  Palm it.  Bottom, squeeze it.  There you go.  You like boobs.  You like boobs.  I'm not into the whole...  So, how was your trip to you?  You like sitting.  Jim, would you like to squeeze my mule now that we're all just sharing?  I showed my boobs and I grabbed another horn.  I grabbed her boob.  It was a great trip, Ma.  If they would do that again, we could rub our helmets together. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, it ever works, right?  That was a very hot scene, wasn't it?  Very hot scene.  Hold on.  I've got to go to Keith.  Keith?  Keith.  What's going on?  Do you want to be on the air with this?  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Keith wants to get this girl for the WOW Summit that he's planning.  To Philly, right?  To Philly, correct.  Yeah.  Would you like to join Keith?  He's doing a WOW Summit.  He's getting a bunch of really hot girls on Harleys to tool down to Philly. 
[01:22:30]  Lord.  And wow everyone in Philadelphia.  When is that going down?  In a couple weeks, Keith?  August 15th.  Are you available August 15th?  I work.  I work all the time.  That's plenty of time to take a day off from work.  I take a day off from here.  I take three days off.  Where do you work?  I work as a lifeguard.  Oh, my God.  She's a lifeguard.  18 years old.  She's a lifeguard.  Tell me where you...  Help!  Yeah, exactly.  Help!  You ever pull a kid's arm out of a shark's stomach? 
[01:23:00]  I figure that's fun.  Where do you lifeguard?  At a camp back in Rockland.  At a camp.  At a camp.  So it's what?  A pool or a lake?  Pool.  Pool to pond.  Whatever.  Wow.  Keith, she's out.  She's out.  All right.  Well, for all the listeners, if you're hot, give us a call.  We'll put something together.  A well-endowed 18-year-old lifeguard in our studio.  It doesn't get much better than you.  How old are the kids you handle?  Anywhere from five to about 14.  Oh, 14-year-old.  You ever see The Sandlot?  You ever see that movie The Sandlot? 
[01:23:30]  Where that little kid makes like he's drowning, so the lifeguard he's in love with gives him  mouth-to-mouth?  Yeah.  And he starts smiling?  Yeah.  I bet you got a lot of that.  Have you ever had to do the mouth-to-mouth to anyone?  No.  A lot of 14-year-olds running to the bathroom every couple minutes.  Oh, just yanking.  What do you wear up on the lifeguard chair?  You wear one piece.  One piece?  Yeah.  Never a bikini?  Some girls look hot in the one piece, though.  Oh, yeah.  Some girls can pull off their look.  Some girls look hot in burlap.  So, you would know what to do if someone was drowning with the mouth-to-mouth thing? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  You want to try your technique out on them?  I'm a little...  Oh, no.  Don't be fucking amazing.  Rachel, can we drown you in the toilet, and then right before you die, we'll pull you  out, and she can save your life.  What?  I'll punch you in the forehead.  No part Yankee Doodle.  Let's go.  I just want to make sure she can do the mouth-to-mouth the right way.  Noreen will get down to that.  Yeah.  She knows that I would have a problem saying, still, you would be a gentleman. 
[01:24:30]  Gentleman?  You know what I mean.  I couldn't think of a better term.  You are so dazed.  Light?  I am really turned on by that.  It really bugs me.  Oh, that was great when they were touching each other.  Come on.  Who wasn't liking that?  Two sexy girls just touching them.  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Very nice.  Almost made up for a brewer's faggot story.  Maybe Doug Henning can rub your feet.  We're finally out of the gay zone, thanks to Becky.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, Rich.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Yeah, I'm here. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, go.  You guys ought to get a couple of those pictures of them filling themselves up on the internet.  Yeah, we'll get the pictures up on the internet.  I think Scott's working on it right now.  We're grabbing each other?  That's our gift to everyone today.  Go to opieandanthony.com in about a half hour.  All right, Rich?  Hey, can we get that announcement, man?  What?  Oh, I was dying for that announcement.  No, we already did the announcement twice now.  You're kidding.  Yeah, thanks, Rich.  Okay.  All right.  Stupid.  I'm not taking off my shirt.  That's great.  Wait, you're going to feel it?

Hope you say something.  I die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Norton?  It never gets old.  Look at that.  No, something like that doesn't get old.  It's never old.  Norton looks like he's looking at a picture.  Rachel, you're looking a little flush.  I know.  Look at you. 
[01:26:00]  You're all red.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  Rachel's hands right now.  Is that the...  Have you touched women's breasts before?  Yeah.  Well, I've hooked up with a girl before.  You've hooked up with a girl before, yeah.  I was seeing one at one point.  You were, were you?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'm sorry, but we've got to end the show right now.  No, no!  Eddie!  My friends and I are very comfortable with you.  That's great.  Hey, I got no problem with that.  Eddie!  Yeah.  Listen, can they play What's in Their Pants?  Oh.  No.  I'm not. 
[01:26:30]  Well, let's ask Becky.  I mean, we'll put her in the soundproof studio.  Becky?  Come on, Becky.  Please?  Okay, maybe I will.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  You want to play Guess What's in?  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Bye, man.  Thank you for the suggestion.  Why don't we hook her up in a studio?  All right.  There will be no cameras, none of that crap, just you alone in the studio.  Before I go.  No, you'll still be on the air with us from the other studio, but what do you need to say?  I just want to say hi to everyone.  Hold on, I think you need to do a topless. 
[01:27:00]  And then you can talk as long as you like.  That's right.  All right.  It never gets old.  Seriously, what's up?  All right.  I just want to say hi to all my friends in Rockland and everyone from QU.  That's all?  Yeah.  You can talk for the next hour if you're going to stay like that.  Don't you know more people?  That's a lot of people.  Tell us how you got into life, Carl.  All right.  Let's set her up in another studio, okay?  Steve?  Yeah.  Steve.  Okay.  Follow Steve?  Okay.  I hope your boyfriend doesn't mind that we're just groping you and stuff. 
[01:27:30]  Well, we're not groping, aren't we, Rachel?  Well, you know what I mean.  I feel like we are just by looking at it.  Rachel got both hands like wide open and just grabbed both of those.  Rachel, how hot was that?  Come on.  Oh, my God.  It was unbelievable.  Be a guy for a minute.  Just tell us.  Be a guy for a minute.  Just tell us.  And, you know, I've actually touched many, not many girls, but, you know, I've definitely,  you know, I have boobs, you know, obviously.  I know what they're supposed to feel like, and those are real, and they're just so supple

[01:31:30]  You never know why she didn't want to do it to Michael, you know.  Huh?  Women get that thing.  You never know.  That may have been the reason.  No, let's ask her.  Get her in here real fast.  You don't want to pick up the phone.  What's the matter?  We'll get another hot teenager to do it before the end of the show, Anthony.  Sure.  We've got to introduce the what's in my pants game to Rochester.  Yeah.  Uh, Becky?  Yeah, what's up?  You didn't want to do the what's in my pants?  No, I think I'll do it, you know, I'll come up over the phone and do it one time.  Oh, when you're like in your own house and stuff and you're feeling a little more comfortable. 
[01:32:00]  Hey!  There you go.  Nothing wrong with that.  That's not a problem.  That's not a problem.  What, Rick?  What are you doing, Rick?  What did Rick just tell you?  Going by the rules from last break where anytime she talks on the mic, her top has to be up.  That's all.  That's all I'm doing.  Oh, my God.  All I see him is he's mouthing something and he's making the universal signal of pull your shirt up.  The universally accepted signal for pull your shirt up.  No problem, Becky. 
[01:32:30]  Did you have fun today?  Yeah, it was a blast.  Cool.  All right.  Yeah, made our night or our day.  That was good.  You're very attractive.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  You know what he's lying.  He said that right before he dashes you in the face with a spade shovel.  Yeah, I really do.  You're very attractive.  Bong!  Becky, I hope you don't feel special because he said that same line to the trainee that was  giving him a hummer.  Thank you.  You're very attractive.  Thank you.  I like the way you rub my back.  I loved you in those light beer for Miller commercials, Mr. Smith. 
[01:33:00]  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  Awful.  We had a surprise for Brewer.  Yeah.  You know, we begged him to come into the studio today and he's like, all right, what do you  guys go playing, man?  I know something weird.  You knew something was up, right?  Yeah, but I don't know.  We're so bummed because it was going to be huge, too.  You were going to be on the air, right?  We could tell you because we only had one shot at this and I don't think we're going  to have another shot anytime soon, right? 
[01:33:30]  His surprise?  I would rather tell him.  Yeah, you might as well tell him.  Yeah, so you were going to be...  Am I going to have to react now?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, because I just know...  Oh, ooh.  No, no, no.  You know why?  You don't have to react because I know it would have been cool for you.  Okay, good.  We were going to have you in the studio maybe doing some Judas Priest and stuff.  Yeah.  And that door was going to open up and Rob Halford was going to walk in.  Get out.  Yeah, I know.  That sucks.  Because he's in town for the MTV thing, but...  So what happened?  He didn't want to do it. 
[01:34:00]  We found out that he was just flying in to do the MTV thing and flying right out.  We thought he was going to be around for a day or two.  Damn.  Yeah.  It was going to be...  Now what a roll.  Just to see your reaction when he walked in the door with you doing the Judas.  How cool is that, right?  That would have been cool, man.  See?  You didn't have to do a fake reaction.  Then maybe he would have tried a massage.  Yeah.  Something tells me he wouldn't have stopped.  Roll over.  Roll over, mate.  I'm going to massage you now. 
[01:34:30]  I have no clue how many nights I spent in the basement just watching.  Yeah.  Got the big fakey top.  I'm looking down.  All hammered.  Skid from town to town.  You don't know anybody cares.  No one cares, man.  Listen to what he's saying. 
[01:35:00]  Go ahead.  Laugh, dick.  Listen to him.  I laugh, dick.  That's why we got to do it.  Breaking the law.  Breaking the law.  Breaking the law.  Let me get another hit.  Don't lip it.  Move away from the window, dick.  Listen to his boss.  The golden future.  That's right.  So much for it.  Crime is broken.  It's not how you get you.  You don't know. 
[01:35:30]  Money, babe.  You don't have a clue.  Mom.  You find yourself doing the same thing, too.  Breaking the law.  Let's go get drunk and fight the Mexicans now.  All right, bro.  What the hell?  We were just kidding.  Rob Halford, everyone.  Sure.  That would have ruled.  No, he's not here.  That would have ruled.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  It's all right, man.  Faggot.  I appreciate the whole shabiggle of it. 
[01:36:00]  We thought you'd find that to be very cool.  It would have looked nuts.  Derek, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I was talking.  I heard your show a couple of weeks ago about the upper deckers and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Upper deckers, yeah.  Yeah.  And I was at McDonald's that week then.  And there was some dick.  The cashier was giving us a real hard time.  Yeah.  So I went in the handicapped bathroom and I left him a little present.  Did the upper decker?  Hell, yeah.  Nice.  I heard one in five minutes after.  Who explained the upper decker on our show? 
[01:36:30]  It was Norton?  Well, you what?  You lift up the...  Take the septic tank top off and you drop one in there.  Right.  So it's reached for days.  The upper decker.  Yeah.  How great is it if Patty had to go in there and scoop it out with her bare hands?  McDonald's, right?  Yeah.  By the way, Stalker Patty left us a note.  It's just disgusting.  We were talking about massages earlier.  Massage.  I wanted a massage.  Here.  You see her yesterday with Billy Idol here?  I was so embarrassed to ask for an autograph. 
[01:37:00]  Did she finally get one?  Yeah, I pushed her.  Yeah.  Her bent back.  I'm like, come on, just go ask him.  And then she goes, I can't wait for you to have you two in.  Let me see.  Hi, Renee.  And early, what did I learn today?  I learned that for a 46-year-old virgin,  there may be benefits in a good massage.  Send me to this massage parlor. 
[01:37:30]  Please.  Oh, my God.  She wants to have...  Thanks for allowing me to come down yesterday and meet Billy Idol.  I had a great time.  We should find a massage parlor that will take care of...  Does she want the knuckle one?  That's what she's saying.  Knuckles disappear.  She wants Mr. Jew.  She wants Mr. Jew to do some knuckling?  I think so.  God, she's...  Is there anyone out there that does massages that wants to give Stalker Patty the happy ending? 
[01:38:00]  You know anybody would just come in.  Yeah, you dump some oil, you do on the shoulders like everyone does, and then just thrust your fist.  Whatever it takes.  Hey, you punch him right in the forehead, and you make him fart Yankee Doodle,  because this is America, now wake up, people.  Whatever works.  Hey, 20 years ago today, MTV started.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  20 years ago today?  Today, yeah.  That's why they're doing the whole MTV thing tonight.  Hey, 20 years ago today, my friend was born. 
[01:38:30]  Can I say that right now?  Yes.  I had to say that right now.  Well, now you're going to have to show your breasts again.  20 years ago.  I wasn't even born.  You weren't even born when MTV started.  I swear, that would have been so much more interesting if she was topless when she said that.  Do you like bowling?  And you weren't even born yet.  Nope.  I'm still a baby.  You were still a couple of years from being born when MTV started.  Oh, yeah.  And that's sad.  I would pay you just to kick me around a hotel room. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Becky, not all guys, you know, think like Mr. Norton over there.  Imagine, though, she's topless and just kicking you in a hotel room.  Yes, I can imagine.  Right, Norton?  You would like that, right?  A lot.  Sure.  What do you want to be kicked?  Just in the meaty belly.  Want her to kick you?  No.  It's got to be alone.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This guy wants to give Patty a massage.  Walt.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  I want to give Patty a massage. 
[01:39:30]  Are you serious?  Yeah, sure.  You want to give Patty a sensuous massage?  Are you a masseuse?  I'm not professional.  I took classes and I reshared my friends all the time.  Hey, why don't we set it up?  It has to happen here.  Yeah.  We'll just set up another studio and we'll just listen in.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be like that.  You have to give her, like, the happy ending and crap.  Eh, no problem.  You dip your fingers in, we'll give you a lye soap to wash your hands with.  I'll take one from the team.  That petrified forest.  All right.  Well, we've got to find out if Starker Patty's definitely into this. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  She is a mess.  You know that, right?  I've seen her, yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen her.  She's built like a turnip.  She has a body like an ant.  She is really awful.  Like an ant.  Yeah.  Would you mind rubbing her thorax?  I'm the one who actually, like, rode the train home with her on the Long Island Railroad.  Really?  Roadshow.  All right.  We have, like, three guys that would do this.  So maybe we'll get all three in and then, you know,  we'll, I don't know, we'll figure something out.  Stay on the line, Walt.  All right.  If Patty calls in and she wants this massage, we'll do it.  Okay. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Boy.  She's in for a surprise.  So I had a side bet with Anthony.  Yeah.  Maybe Brewer could help and Norton stuff.  So MTV started today, right?  Yeah.  They were only playing 13 videos.  13 videos.  Over and over again.  And now I got the list in front of me.  What is that video?  The first one they ever played was that one.  It has to be that.  The Buggles.  Oh, great.  We have it.  In the world's largest rock and roll library. 
[01:41:00]  And there you were a snapper head.  Long Island going, what is this?  Right.  Didn't we do this after five years and ten years and fifteen years?  And now, what's the big deal about 20?  Great.  Who doesn't know this is the first song?  This is the first.  Dude, did we really need this back then?  It was a fake.  You know, it was a fake band, too.  The Buggles.  Yeah, they were like studio musicians.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, and this started it.  Oh, they want to take Becky out of the studio.  20 years ago.  Why?  Who?  Who does?  Rick does.  Why?  I don't know.  She's just there with her nice boobs, and we're just going to go to her every once in  a while to, you know, show us.  Problem?  Is there a problem?  Problem.  So, anyway, everyone knows that was the first video.  But I don't think Ann could name five on this list.  Probably couldn't. 
[01:42:00]  What can I say?  Okay.  Let me think.  My Sharona.  Hold on.  You guys.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  She blinded me with science.  That's what I like about you.  Is that on there?  No.  That's later.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  That's later.  Yeah.  That is a little later.  There was 13 videos that were rotating.  Uh-huh.  I heard now, I inadvertently heard that a Rod Stewart song was on there.  Yeah.  Do you know which one, though?  Tonight's the Night.  Look.  Uh, Hot Legs.  Was there any metal songs? 
[01:42:30]  Huh?  Any hard rock metal?  None.  Wow.  Like, none.  Really?  Because that's all I remember for a while it was.  Devil Went Down to Georgia.  You see that Unchained video a lot?  Unchained!  And then...  Jumping off with spandex.  That was like...  Yeah, that was a little later, though.  That was later.  You've got to think.  This is 1981.  That's what I really remember.  This is the Rod Stewart song.  Oh.  Yeah.  What song is this?  You don't even know the name, right? 
[01:43:00]  Right now, I'm afraid to kill.  This is rock.  This is rock.  This stinks.  Yeah, I don't know what that says.  This is Rod Stewart's She Won't Dance With Me.  That's one of the first videos.  Fish heads, fish heads, roly-poly fish heads?  Nope.  That's not on the list either.  Wow.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Mexican radio?  Nope.  Jason.  Any Aussie?  No Aussie on there?  No.  No heavy metal.  I don't want candy.  I think I know two of them. 
[01:43:30]  All right, go ahead.  Is one of them She's a Beauty?  Nope.  No, that was later on.  That's the two of us in production.  And, um, uh, that's another one, uh, Heat of the Moment.  Heat of the Moment.  Nah, that came, that came like 85-ish.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Earlier than that?  We're talking 81.  August 81.  Well, Burning For You.  Somebody just said Burning For You.  That was definitely one of them.  Now, I thought Burning For You was one of the first videos.  It was not on the, uh, uh, on the list here we got, the first 13 videos.  Don't cross.  You're just talking about the first 13 in a row or the first year?  See, when I started watching MTV, though, Burning For You was in that rotation every, like, 
[01:44:00]  two hours.  Maybe not.  And so was She's a Beauty, too.  We did do it in the burnout.  Burning For You might have been 83, 84.  You want to know what it was?  No one had MTV when it first came out anyway.  So that's half the problem.  Was there any Weird Al stuff in the first 13?  No Weird Al.  Don't pay the ferryman till they get you to the other side.  Don't pay the ferryman.  Don't pay the ferryman till they get you to the other side.  Wow.  Norton.  Coming up with that.  That's on the list either.  The ferryman. 
[01:44:30]  We were talking about Big Country yesterday, remember?  In a big country.  Shut up.  They're riding around in their ATVs.  David Bowie.  Pass the duchy.  No David Bowie.  No David Bowie.  Come and I lose.  No, no, nope.  I know that.  Adamant.  Nope.  Eric.  Oh, yeah.  No Arpenters.  Huh?  Carpenters.  Nope.  You know something?  Think of this now.  Got to think this way.  It was 1981.  Now, no one made videos for MTV yet, so they had to be videos that were already out there 
[01:45:00]  and made.  Oh, good.  So it's got to be late 70s stuff.  That's what I'm thinking.  Blondie?  Blondie's not even on the list.  ABBA.  ABBA, no.  No Dancing Queen.  You guys haven't gotten one fog hat?  Charlie Daniels?  Hold on.  Let's go to Frank.  Yeah, something like that.  Frank might have one.  Rush?  Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I know one of them.  I think it was a second video played.  It was a Pat Benatar song.  I can't remember the name of it. 
[01:45:30]  It's a Pat Benatar song, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which one?  Oh, wait.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Oh, this was one of them, Pat Benatar?  Jones gets this later, right?  What you trying to do to my heart?  What you trying to do to my heart?  I love the way she whined through every song.  You go around telling lies, and now you want to come back.  Right.  This is one of the original ones?  Yeah.  You better run it.  You go around. 
[01:46:00]  You go around.  You go around.  You go around.  Was Hart?  What about her day?  Remember Pat Benatar, where she was like the fighter pilot?  Yeah, I like that one.  Were you running with the shadows of the night?  She made two.  It was running with the shadows and the Help Me Out here.  Love is a Battlefield.  That was my favorite one.  Love is a Battlefield.  And then they were acting in there, and at one point the guy grabbed it.  Leave me alone! 
[01:46:30]  You know that?  She screamed, leave me alone!  And then her father yells, don't come back!  Right.  That was like when they would throw in some dialogue in the song.  Hey, Becky, do you remember Pat Benatar?  You better run.  Probably never heard the Dave song in your life.  No, I've heard it.  Just don't remember it on the air.  Yeah, okay.  Death Leopard.  No Death Leopard.  Michael Jackson.  No Michael Jackson.  What?  No.  Zeppelin.  No.  Let's dance.  Let's dance.  We only have nothing there?  We only have three out of the 13 so far.  Son of a bitch.  The Buggles, Pat Benatar, and Rod Stewart. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  How about Marshall Crenshaw?  No.  Come on, I'm reaching.  Someday, someway.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  I remember that piece of crap.  Come on, help me here.  He was on the right track.  I'm trying.  You were on the right track.  Like a rush.  Coach 79, 80.  Charlie?  Farner.  Farner.  Farner.  No.  Journey.  No.  No.  Wow.  Journey.  I'm trying.  This song.  I knew this would be hard.  All right.  I'll go back where I was.  See, I would have went with like... 
[01:47:30]  First wind and fire.  Remember Marshall Tucker.  Remember...  Nope.  Stephen Lynch.  Remember...  Remember Chilliwack?  Chilliwack.  Chilliwack.  I thought that would be one of the further...  Remember that song?  She was gone, gone, gone.  Gone, gone, gone.  She'll be gone so long.  She'll be gone, gone, gone.  Let's see if David has one.  David.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I have a Gary Newman.  I think it's here in my car.  No?  No.  No, you're kidding.  It's harder than you think, man.  Let's go to West Coast. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, oh, oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Who did Whip It?  Devo.  Devo.  Son of a bitch.  No.  No, no.  They were a little...  I hate this list.  They were like mid-80s.  West Coast Dave.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  All right, I got a good one.  All right.  Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.  No?  How about the Heart of Glass by Blondie?  No Blondie.  Wow.  Oh, man.  All right, I'm punching out.  All right.  He's punching out.  It's amazing.  This is...  No one on the phones has it.  And we should get...  You guys should definitely get a few more of these.  What was the other one that used to be on? 
[01:48:30]  38th Special.  Oh, which one?  Hold on loosely.  Hold on loosely.  Yes!  Oh, yes!  Thank God, I got one.  I'm trying to think of any of those country...  Like those Southern Rock ones.  Did you hate when your girlfriend at the time sang the song a little too bad?  Southern Rock.  38th Special live at Nassau Coliseum.  Hey, why'd you just sing that verse? 
[01:49:00]  No, I just...  I like this song.  What the F was that just about?  Some time ago...  What are you talking?  I'm not talking about it.  I just like the song.  You like the Judas Priest craft.  This is what I listen to.  Man, no one has any of them on the phone lines. 
[01:49:30]  Bob from Philly.  Yo, how you doing, guys?  All right.  You guys are kicking A down here in Philly.  We appreciate the support so far.  Thank you, Bob.  Yeah, it's got to be either a Go-Go song or a Michael Jackson song.  No Michael Jackson.  Neither one.  No one goes...  No.  Andy Lennox?  No.  No deal.  Yeah, that was later.  How about I Just Ate a Monkey by Jeffrey Dahmer?  What about...  Hey, Fish.  Yo.  You got a guess?  I got two guesses. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  I got Pretenders, Branson Pocket.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh!  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  Wow, that's a good one.  Wow, bravo.  That was good for you guys then.  Walking down the street in her leather.  Oh, no, she was the waitress.  No, the waitress, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Waitress in the diner.  Bananorama.  No, there you go.  I got one more guess.  All right, go ahead, Fish.  I got Leo Sawyer or Sayer, whatever it is. 
[01:50:30]  Leo Sayer?  When I Need You or something like that?  Leo Sayer.  Is that the guy saying something like that?  Man!  I Need You.  I know, I didn't want to guess that one.  He was that Richard Simmons looking guy who had a song.  No, Leo Sayer.  Oh, man, why say that one then?  All right.  All right.  See you later.  REO Speedwagon?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah?  An REO song?  Now, which one?  Hold on, hold on.  Let me think.  Let me think.  Oh, oh.  God, they all sound the same.  Hold on.  Can I fight that? 
[01:51:00]  Which one?  Wait, fight that feeling anymore.  I just got this feeling anymore.  What is that feeling like I'm never happy for?  No?  No?  I can't fight this feeling anymore.  It's not I can't fight this feeling anymore?  Wait, is that the name of it?  No.  Right, fight that feeling.  I just got that feeling anymore.  No, it's the other one.  Oh, wait.  No, it's like that rocking one.  Oh.  Yeah, this one.  I skated to this song once.  Hey.  North Port at that Laces Roller. 
[01:51:30]  Couples Only.  Couples Only.  This is the Couples Only song.  I got massage this one.  I remember it was Colorado.  I got whorled to it.  Yeah, REO.  Woo!  Another verse. 
[01:52:00]  I was waiting for the hook.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we don't have to.  Believe me.  Well, I'll keep it on if you want to.  What was that for Tommy Boy?  It doesn't bother me.  Driving around in your car.  Make sure the windows are up, man, so no one hears it.  There it is.  There it is.  Take it on the road and make it merry, baby. 
[01:52:30]  Then I know I want you around.  Now, um, Take On Me, that song.  Do you remember that one?  Take on me.  Don'tES.  I just got to read off.  People are saying the cars or pop music.  Remember that song?  Pop music?  You got to go back.  Whippet, John Cougar, Mellencamp.  None of these made it.

Well, that was last week  It's really dark here  Tommy Shaw comes in here in a second 
[01:54:30]  What a waste of a guitar player  Why?  Well, then you'd have to go to the other band he was in  With Nugent  Damn Yankees  Yeah  But the guy knew how to rock  And he had this as a lead singer  Well  Ugh  You know, they made a lot of money  And now they hate each other  Come on, I want to hear the rock  Here it comes  Tommy's like

[02:06:00]  Her first appearance  I'm just messing with you  Sarah Silverman  Anthony  Yes  Woo  Ow  They're plugging her in  You saw Sarah Silverman  Yeah  Caroline  Very funny  Very good  We had to tell her  Because our listeners are going to call us hypocrites and stuff  So we both had to admit to Sarah that we don't like female comedians  I know  And you know something  You gotta stick by your guns on that 
[02:06:30]  But Anthony  She's really funny  And you know something  When I came in the next day  I said Sarah Silverman  Very funny  And very hot  I do believe you said it as well  Yeah  I thought you were very cute  Yeah  I'm alright  Because you don't see that on stage either  Look at her  I'm alright  Girl comics  I'm alright  I'm alright  Saturday Night Live alumni over there too  Right  Well Brewer had to live through it also  Oh you make the same faces  I've been around to hear that  Every time someone likes me 
[02:07:00]  See this is the cool  See Daryl had  Well I shouldn't say it  One time someone said  This place is like the comedy of  This is like the nom of comedy  The nom of comedy  You gotta get through it  And I'll tell you why he's right  Because no matter how much you can't stand anyone  When you see another ex-SNL person  You immediately go  I know  It's like you made it  I know  You made it  I know  And even the ones that have been on and scored  Still we see each other  I know  I know 
[02:07:30]  Yeah it's kind of tough  Like if you guys went to work  At a car wash  Would you have to give Lauren  Some of the tip money  Is that how bad it is  I heard it's gotten that  That bad  Where now it's an eight year contract  Yeah those are crazy  That is pretty crazy  Whatever you know  It's a  I can't help but root for it  It's been so long since I was there  You don't really care when you leave  You're just kind of like  Whatever  New life  It's just  I never think about it 
[02:08:00]  So when people go like  From SNL  I'm just like  Really?  It felt like  A lifetime ago  Yeah we don't have to talk about that crap  Brewer  I can't watch it  Brewer told us all the stories  He gave us all the great dirt  It was great  At least Brewer had characters and stuff  Like my friends were always like  Making fun of me  Like oh are you going to do some of your old SNL characters  I had nothing  I had nothing  Zero  The girls had it really tough too  You guys had it a lot rough  You were going to play the wife  Did you ever get to play the wife in a sketch 
[02:08:30]  Or the daughter or something?  Nothing?  I was mostly like  I think I blocked it out  Because sometimes I'll watch it on Comedy Central  And I'll be like  I'll see myself  And I swear to God  I have no recollection  No recollection  It's like wow  That's awful  Wow what am I going to do in this scene?  But I used to like  I used to smoke a lot of pot  That when I was there  I had a rule that once it hit 2am  Because I was hired as a writer  As soon as it hit 2am  Then I could go in my room  And stand on my desk  And open the window 
[02:09:00]  And smoke a joint  And I swear to God  Every time  Because we'd write until like  7 in the morning  I'd come back  And all of a sudden  I'd be like  I love these guys so much  I'm at Saturday  That's the only time that I was like  I'm at Saturday Night Live  You're right  This is amazing  Yeah  So really  It was good  It was medicinal  Jim can you tell one of your  Norm Macdonald stories  Oh man  He kills us with the  Norm Macdonald stories  What was the one with the  Tomorrow came in  What was the one where you guys 
[02:09:30]  Were playing some kind of game  In the hall  Oh that  That's  We would play football  Like me  Colin  Tracy  And Norm  And so  But Norm would get so competitive  He'd come to your room  And say  Hey bro  Let's kill you  Thugget  We've got to play you  He'd go in the hallway  Right now  That's incredible  Hold on  There you go  So he literally would come in the room  He'd go  Hey come on bro  What are you doing  You're right here  Goat fag this way  Come on  Let's do this here 
[02:10:00]  Colin Quinn  They'd go  Alright let's go  Me and bro  Long Island Queens  Against you faggers  From the west coast of Canada  So we go in the hallway  You know I'd be just zapped  I'm like  If I get on  Whatever  And blast the Metallica  Whatever  We'd go in there  And we'd start playing ball  But it would get rough  You'd have to go  It's a hallway  So we're playing football  In the hallway  You know Sarah  Yeah we used to play  But we  Norm 
[02:10:30]  Me and Colin  Would always be  And it'd come to the point  Where I tripped him  So hard one day  Because he gave me  Like kind of a hard elbow  I was like  Oh alright  This is the way we're playing  This is the way it is  So I had work boots on  And he was going  Fasting for a pass  I was like  Where  Oh  Holy Christ  He kicked me in the shin  How's that bro  He just kicked me in the shin  Colin's like  Don't be a faggot  Let's go  Keep the game going  So we  We end up winning the game  Norm 
[02:11:00]  Whenever he would lose  He was so competitive  He'd get his assistant  Who was  Who was the chick  And he'd go  You stand on that end  Yeah  Go down there  Go down there  And he'd play this game  Where he'd take the ball  And we'd throw it  As hard as we can  Down the hallway  At Laurie Jo?  Yeah  Yeah  And then did she thank you?  Look at this inside humor  It's cracking up  Bro  Part of you  Part of you  You were like sick  You don't have to stand down there 
[02:11:30]  And you're like  Just trying to catch this way  Throw the ball  Like a thousand miles an hour  Bounce  Smack her in the face  Big  Yeah  Sacking up  Walking up  Dick  And then you know  We'd join in  And we'd play  And that was that  Right on  Fun times  It was  It's a lunacy there  So you don't know  Fun times  Jeremy what's going on?  Hey what's up  Everyone loves the F one  It needed though  To describe the hot  She totally is 
[02:12:00]  She's the effing hot  Yes  You got it  And she's hysterical  But also mainly  There's an article about her  On page 18  In the daily news today  Saying when she was on Conan  She made some kind of  Racist comments  I missed it  Well it was  It was a chink joke  And she's getting a lot of  A lot of press over it  18  18  Here we go  I just didn't hear it  And I kind of wanted to know  What that was about  And if she  You know  What the deal with that was  It was a  It's a joke  Clearly  Illuminating racism 
[02:12:30]  It's not a racist joke  It's a joke about racism  And this guy is  It sucks that you have  To even explain it  Yeah the fact that  In today's comedy  I can't believe you have  To explain jokes  So you don't piss off people  Yeah  I just missed the joke  I wanted to hear it  People are so afraid  Of special interest groups  You know what I mean  That that's the only reason  That a place like NBC  Or whatever  Apologizes  I don't care  That I said it  They care about  Like money  Am I on there?  Yeah advertise  Yeah believe it or not 
[02:13:00]  This is actually  The way we do our show  Well here's the problem  Well I want to hear the joke  Yeah let's hear the joke  Ready?  Yeah  Alright so I got a  Jury duty notice  And then I say  How there's nothing funny  About jury duty  Except for the obvious  Duty part  And um  No okay  So I'm filling out  You got to fill out a form  And you send it in  And then you're  Randomly selected  And I don't want to go  To jury duty  So I'm filling out the form  And my friend said  You know why don't you  Write something really  I don't want to  I don't want to  I don't want to  I don't want to  I don't want to  I don't want to  I don't want to  I hate chinks  I'm thinking yeah 
[02:13:30]  You know but then  When I think about it  I don't want people  To think that of me  You know I just want  To get out of jury duty  So I just filled out  The form and I wrote  I love chinks  Yeah  And they had a problem  With that  Well you know  There's a lot of Asians  That watch the show  They contribute nothing  To humor  No it's one guy  Oh she's angry  There's that  Had to be one good  Asian comedian out there  Well maybe a couple  Of funny Asians  Margaret Cho is awesome  Margaret Cho  Hey have you guys  Said when she's playing 
[02:14:00]  Next anywhere  So me or Margaret Cho  You  Oh yeah  I'm going to be  At Joe's Pub  This Monday  There's  The 830 show  Is sold up  But the 1030 show  Is wide  Open  Where is that  Open  It's on Lafayette  Near Astor Place  It's at the public theater  It's real nice  Kind of classy  Alright Jeremy  Thanks a lot  So what happened  After you told the joke  Nothing happened  Nothing to you  But then  Did real well  Nothing happened  Didn't hear anything  A week later  I wake up  And my mom called 
[02:14:30]  And said  They were talking  About you in the view  And I was like  That's weird  Yeah why  What are they doing  And I guess  The only one  Who was sticking up  For me  Was Barbara Walters  But she's the one  That you'd want  To stick up for you  You mean the comic  There  The alleged comic  Wasn't  Joy was like  Middle of the road  Come on  Is what I heard  You know what  Cracks me up  About it  She called me  A wackadoo  Did she really say  Did she really say that  What is the  What is the  A wackadoo  You know what  I got news for you  They're all hypocrites  Because they're the  First ones  The ones that 
[02:15:00]  Criticize Sarah  Are the first ones  That go home  And go  Now you know  Plan the H  What that really  Should have been called  It was about  You know what  Taking over  The damn universe  You know it  I know it  We just can't say  That word in public  But you say it  I say it  It's like ice cream  For Christ's sake  It's America  Oh my god  Is that a  First ones  Is that a  Meredith Vieira  Impression  That shit  Take your shirt off  I know  That whole 
[02:15:30]  Coffee clonch there  The special interest  Groups got involved  And called NBC  Right  A guy named  It's one guy  Guy  Ioki  Yep  President of the  Media Action Network  For Asian Americans  I looked up the other  Stuff this guy's  Picked on  And it's like crazy  Like really  Like he's fighting  He wants Sulu  To have his own  Show  He yelled at  He got mad at  Susan Sarandon  We all know  What a racist she is  And she covers  With that like  That thin veneer  Of years of 
[02:16:00]  Humanitarian series  This like  This actress  On a  Mad TV  Alex Bornstein  Does this  Character  Miss Swan  Or whatever  It's really  Probably like  The best character  On that show  And he's like  They should hire  An Asian American  To do that character  It's like  You don't hire someone  To do someone else's  Character on a  Sketch show  You know  It's like  He's got a really  Important job  And he stinks at it  Good  Sparking up the wrong tree  Hallelujah  And then  Well I'm pissed  I'm pissed  Because then NBC  They edited your joke 
[02:16:30]  Out of the show  I mean it aired  But for future airings  You will not  Hear the chink joke  I taped it  When it was  Originally on  And I think  That tape  Is the only  Tape that exists  That has that  Joke on it  NBC couldn't  Have apologized  Fast enough  That's too bad  That is so  Too bad  We actually have  Audio of Sarah  Saying that  On the show  Oh really  Do we  Stock that chink  A day's pay  For napping  On the job  Yes sir  Sounded like  Blazing Sound 
[02:17:00]  That is uncanny  You don't want to  Lose that  Bike messenger audience  They're a big part  Of the buying market  People don't know  Is that Norton  Is an  Oddly  Is an angel  That really annoys me  Yeah he really  He really  Puts that across  He really puts  That angel  Part of him across  Despicable people  Throw a cup of AIDS  On him  And we have more 
[02:17:30]  Audio of Sarah  On Conan O'Brien  How did you people  Try to get a little  Track late  Not to jump around  Like a bunch of  Kansas City faggots  Oh my god  That's horrible  Blazing Saddles  Awful  Blazing Saddles  Always funny  Despicable  Norton  I was talking about you  And you're agreeing  Mark what's going on  How you doing guys  Hey  She is smoking  Yeah Sarah's hot  And I just want to say  They just re-ran  Her Larry Sanders episode  A couple of weeks ago 
[02:18:00]  And I cranked it out to it  Just want to say  Guy's cranking it to you Sarah  How does that make you feel  Thank you for cranking it to me  Are you busy this weekend  I don't get cranked enough  You probably get cranked a lot  No I'm not doing anything  More than you think Sarah  I wish I could hang out  With someone I don't know  What are you doing Saturday night  Hanging out with you  Cool  I'll meet you on the corner  Alright  I'll be down at 10  Alright  Not really right  Not really right  Hey Mike what's going on  Mikey  Hey what's up guys 
[02:18:30]  Hey  I just wanted to say  Sarah Silverman  On Mr. Show  Hilarious  Thanks  I love that show  That was a great show  I just saw the episode  Like last night  We're earthlings  Let's blow up earthlings  Oh yeah  This is like a  Chris Harley thing  That was awesome  That was awesome  Remember when you wrote that song  You gotta be psyched  At all the pressure  Getting over the chink joke  Though right  Yeah it's like  It was like a bad thing  That turned real nice  You're not sitting there 
[02:19:00]  Apologizing in the media  Or anything stupid like that  Are you  No  Good  Hallelujah  Anybody else jump on the bandwagon  Any other Asian groups  That wanted to see you  Driven out of the business  Nobody  This one guy  This one guy  I've had nothing but support  From anybody else  Yes  Captain Sulu  That would be wonderful  He obviously has cash  His father  I think his father  Owns Benny Hanna  Or something  Seriously  And his sister's like a model  That's a Jap place though  He's Japanese  Well everyone knows  Chink means Chinese  And Jap means Japanese 
[02:19:30]  That is actually not correct  I'll explain  Please  How about savage  Does that just cover all of them  Chink covers all Asians  Because what the derogatory term  Comes from  A lot  Which is just like kike  Is that  Is making fun of the way they talk  Chink chink chink  Chink chink chink  Right  And like  I never knew that  Jewish people  Hebrew is like  You know  A lot of  That's why they say kike  Kike  Chink is from that  Little tidbit  I thought chink was always Chinese 
[02:20:00]  Jap or nip  Would be Japanese  How about ding or zipper head  Dink  Zipper head  That's more Southeast Asian  Korean  Vietnamese  Slope  Vietnamese  Korean  Cambodian  Is dink a derogatory word  Oh yes  Oh shoot  Every time  Uh oh  What did you do  I call all my friends dink  But I just thought it was like  Another word for  For dick  Uh oh  See  No no no  You can call someone a dick  Like don't be a dick  Like that 
[02:20:30]  Right  Right  So I thought it  I thought dink was like  The G rated version of that  And so I thought it was  I wanted to bring it back  Oh yeah  Say that one around  Some press  And things all there  I'm not going to say it  I didn't know  You got to tell her  What you think  Asian people sound like  Anthony  The model airplanes  Oh the Cox model airplanes  You ever seen the little airplanes  You used to see in the schoolyard  Where you'd have this little string  Go  Watch platoon  Believe me  It's true  Every time this guy complains  They should show video 
[02:21:00]  Of walking  Blowing his head off  At the end of the deer hunter  That's what they drove him to  And good for you  With a brilliant joke  Norton  Why are you in such a bad mood  I'm defending  He's a great comic  And that really annoys me  No I appreciate it  But I mean  I think it's  I'm defending the joke  But I'm defending it  Because it's not  Not racist  No I know  I'm coming out of the joke  Yeah  Much of war making  Driving tanks over their own people  Good human rights record  Why don't you protest that  Well that actually is a good point 
[02:21:30]  Because you know  If he really is looking out  For the Asian people  And he should be  You know  Working in China  Where it's the  The most oppressive  You know  Government in the world  It's much easier  To do it here  In the United States  Why not pick on it  But why  You know  So he's picking on comics  It's like such a waste of time  Yeah  Please  Tom what's going on  Hey guys  Huge fan  But I have to call out  Anthony on something here  I think the direct quote was  There's nothing less funny  Than a female comic  I said that  We explained that  When we first started with Sarah 
[02:22:00]  Yeah  They've been sticking by their guns  And if you remember  After I saw Sarah  I said that she was very funny  When I came back from Carolina  Tom we all knew  You guys were going to call us on it  And we both said to Sarah  Before she came on the air  Sarah we got to tell you  We hate all female comics  But Anthony saw you recently  And laughed really hard  And thought you were really funny  I know there are few and far between  Though most of them do suck  But she's really funny  There's a difference here  You know  It's not like we're  Most of them just bitch and moan  You know  I got to give someone else credit  And I wish I knew her name  Maybe Norton or one of you guys  Will help me out here 
[02:22:30]  There's a lady that works with Louis Black  That I saw recently  Really funny  With the red hair  Right  She used to be an actress or something  God I would love to give her  You know  Some props today  Because she was really funny too  You haven't touched any kids  Sarah have you  In the line of any female comics  Like  Is it molestation  If the kid makes the first move  Otherwise no  Very nice 
[02:23:00]  Did you see all the people  Like parents and stuff  Bringing their kids  To support Paula Poundstone  At that last hearing she had  They deserved to be raped  They deserved it  Oh my god  Oh man  Yeah  These mothers were handing Paula  Their children  So she could hug them  And kiss them  And the press is just having a field day  Trying to get like the  The worst shot possible  The one they put was  She's being hugged by this girl  About 13, 14 years old  She's got the little budding one starting  And you can see Paula's hand  Is right on her side  By a rib cage  And you look and say 
[02:23:30]  She's just got to move her thumb  From 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock  And she's touching this  Little girl's breast  And you know  They probably had a million pictures  Of her  That were harmless  But that one  That one  Well maybe it's just me  I wonder what the story  I'm just so curious  What the real story is  She was drunk  She's using that old gag  How many times  Have we pulled that one  Out of the hat  Well I was like  There's no way  She did anything wrong  She's you know  And then when she went  Into rehab  I was like  There you go  You know it happens  When you have a few in you  I can't wait to whack

[02:30:00]  What are you going to fly these people  Get a bus  Overhead  You need agents  Managers  This  Man dude  Yeah  Road managers  Bands  Yeah  You know it's  It's sort of related  But you just made me  Remind me of something  What's up  We wanted to sell wow shirts  At the dice show  At the garden  Hey  Talking about people  Getting their paws  Into your  Into your stuff  Yeah  We  Oh yes  We're like  I want 90%  We don't  The union 
[02:30:30]  We weren't making a lot of money  Doing this thing  We're thinking wow  You know this wow thing's a great idea  People love the wow shirts  We'll sell them cheap  Because we don't  We really try not to  Rape our listeners  To begin with  We forgot there are other people out there  That are raping us  Yeah  So we get all these wow shirts  And we're selling them at the garden  And we must have sold  And am I lying  Of like a thousand of them  Yeah  It was ridiculous  How many we sold  That's a lot  That's it  And we kept the cost down  It was like  I don't know  Maybe $12 a shirt 
[02:31:00]  Really cheap  And to make a long story short  We're doing the math  Like hey  We just made $12,000  And the night's work  Nice  After the unions  And all this got their hands  Oh the union that works  The concession stands there  Because you can't just get  You know stinky  To get in one of those booths  No  At the garden  They have to have  Especially trained people  Right  That know how to look out  From the other side of the booth  I guess  I don't know  And you have to get insurance  In case that  Right  Something happens 
[02:31:30]  And it turned out  That  They take 50%  Like whoa  A thousand a week for insurance  50% right off the top  They take  And then they had to pay  50%  And then we had to pay  Everyone  To make a long story short  I think they sent us a bill  Yeah  It like cost us money  To sell the shirts that cheap  That's like when I first started  Playing this tour  I went  Oh  Okay  You know what  Well  Let's make it like a metal show  I want laser  If I'm going bankrupt  Laser lights  Give me laser lights  And flicked out lights 
[02:32:00]  Let's go  I'm getting a whole band  Screw it  Yeah  You know what it is  When you go to a show  And you're all pissed off  That the band is charging  So much for t-shirts  It ain't the band  No  They're just  They want to make some money  But 50% of that shirt money  Is going to  To the union  That employs the guy  Or represents the guy  That is selling those shirts  Well I saw ticket sales  Like when I looked at the list  Of the places I was going  Because I thought they'd be like  10, 15 bucks  Yeah  You get them 
[02:32:30]  It's like 25  I'm like what?
