<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, recapping Friday's broadcast.  This included a discussion of Jim Ross's (JR) in-studio interview, where he detailed his three divorces ("wandering eye"), and his experiences with Vince McMahon, including a story about McMahon defecating on live television.  The surprisingly positive reception to Scott Shannon's call-in was also highlighted, along with listener reactions to JR's interview,  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton's Oscar live-tweeting, fat-shaming comments towards Gabourey Sidibe, and a call from Colin Quinn offering interview advice. The pre-show also covered Eric and Roland's weight loss struggles, and previewed upcoming guests: physicist Brian Greene and Cesar Millan.

The main show started with a comparison of Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel's late-night shows, notably Fallon's polar plunge with Rahm Emanuel.  The Oscars dominated the conversation, focusing on negative comments about an actress's appearance, the forced pairing of black and white presenters, and the lackluster audience reaction to the "In Memoriam" segment.  The hosts discussed various celebrity tweets about the Oscars.  A significant portion was dedicated to a friend's Cronut business and its legal battle with a Little Italy bakery.  The show also featured an anecdote about a listener's baby feces mustache, continued discussion of Scott Shannon's move to CBS FM and criticisms of the Todd Show, and a phone call with Bob Levy, contributing his Oscar commentary. A clip of Scott Shannon thanking Opie and Anthony for having him on aired.

The next segment opened with a discussion of a Wikipedia entry alleging Todd Pettengill plagiarized "Jerky Boys" routines, followed by a discussion of the upcoming Brian Greene interview, referencing his work on string theory. A caller, Justin from Pittsburgh, shared a story about comedian Jimmy's clumsiness.  The conversation shifted back to the Oscars, focusing on Donald Trump's tweets criticizing Ellen DeGeneres' hosting, performers, and the overall production.  The hosts commented on various performances, winners, and the lack of *American Hustle* awards.  They discussed several celebrities' appearances, notably Kim Novak's apparent plastic surgery, playing a clip of her uncomfortable Oscar presentation.  Matthew McConaughey's appearance and "large head" were also noted.

The show then turned to a rumored JFK, RFK, and Marilyn Monroe sex tape going up for auction.  The hosts debated its authenticity, with a caller questioning the seller's legitimacy due to previous fraud charges and refusal to preview the tape. This led to tangents, including a story about Opie and his brother's adolescence and Opie watching couples have sex.  Several commercial breaks occurred throughout this segment.


The following segment started with a call from Brian in Canada discussing the Oscars – *12 Years a Slave*'s win, perceived political correctness, and the forced interracial presenter pairings. The discussion transitioned to Spike Lee's criticism of gentrification, sparking debate about its validity given Lee's own wealth and location. Callers shared anecdotes about gentrification in South Boston, Chicago's Northwest Side, and Brooklyn.  Brian Greene then joined in-studio.  The conversation covered string theory, including mirror symmetry, the unified theory, and potential spacetime tears. Greene explained complex concepts accessibly, illustrating his work and research challenges.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Greene's work and promotional announcements for the hosts’ stand-up shows. Mentions of Jared Leto, Ellen DeGeneres, and Bono were made.


The next segment featured Brian Greene's continued discussion of physics. He explained the speed of light, debunking a neutrino measurement error, and detailing Einstein's theory of relativity with thought experiments. He shared his agnostic views on God and his belief in extraterrestrial life.  He explained the Higgs boson ("God particle") and the Higgs field, recounting its discovery.  Quantum entanglement was discussed, emphasizing that it doesn't violate the speed of light.  He also gave his opinion on the science in *Gravity*.  Following Greene, Cesar Millan joined, discussing his depression, suicide attempt, and insights into dog behavior. He offered training advice, emphasizing communication and understanding canine psychology.  The importance of family agreement when getting a dog was highlighted, and Millan described his new show.


The final segment featured Cesar Millan discussing dog training, emphasizing staying calm and assertive with aggressive dogs and understanding canine energy. He addressed housebreaking and anecdotes from his immigration journey and career. Callers asked about their dogs' behaviors, which Millan attributed to owner energy and unconscious biases. The show briefly discussed cats and rabbits' behavior.  The segment ended with promotions for Millan's "Cesar 911."  The post-show included further discussion of Millan's interview, listener calls, promotional spots, a humorous moment with an unaware caller, and further discussion of gentrification.

[00:01:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  We are live.  It is Monday.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Call up.  Be a part of the pre-show.  Start your week.  Right.  With me, Sam Roberts.  As we talk about everything we can expect to happen on today's massive Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Big guests.  Big news to talk about.  A whole lot going on.  And, of course, we're going to be recapping everything that happened on Friday's O&A show.  And I'm telling you.  We didn't even have any weirdos booked for Friday's show.  And it was still one of the big Friday shows.  I mean, Friday, to say Friday's show was newsworthy would be a vicious, vicious understatement.  So call up 866-WOW1-WOW. 
[00:02:00]  866-969-1969.  Of course, we're going to get into everything that happened at the Academy Awards last night.  What a night it was for live tweeting, huh?  I saw E-Rock was getting a couple in there.  I was live tweeting the whole thing.  But Opie, Anthony, and Jim were on fire last night.  We'll get into that and talk about some of their tweets and how it's going to affect today's Opie and Anthony show in just a couple minutes.  But, as I said, the big guests on the Opie and Anthony show over on Friday, Jim Ross, good old JR from the WWE, was in studio. 
[00:02:30]  And I got a lot of feedback on this interview from a lot of people that are not wrestling fans but were captivated by the old man's stories.  Anyways, let's hear JR.  JR, he's the lead announcer for the WWE during their most popular period, right? 
[00:03:00]  During the time when Opie and Anthony were still watching, during your Stone Cold and your Rock Attitude era, Jim Ross was the lead announcer.  But as out of hand as things got in pro wrestling, JR was always Mr. Professionalism.  He wasn't talking about the chicks.  He wasn't cursing.  He was there to call the action.  So when he was on the show talking about his wandering eye, I think it immediately brought people up to speed on the type of guy this was.  Let's go to track six, Sal. 
[00:03:30]  How many?  How many total?  Yeah.  Three.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  The good thing is that I didn't have any money when that one fell.  I had a little bit of money on the second one.  Oh, no.  But then the third one has been married to me since 1993.  All right.  So you figured it out.  Yeah, finally.  I've matured enough to maintain a relationship for over a few years.  You think it was your fault that the other ones didn't make it?  Oh, hell yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Make it?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you have a wandering eye?  Is that what it was?  Everything wandered.  Everything wandered.  Even that big old dick of J.R. has wandered.  Apparently, of course, J.R. was talking about his ex-wives in that clip.  He went through three ex-wives because he had a wandering eye, I guess.  But you go back.  I mean, Google image pictures of this guy in 93.  You can't picture him.  He doesn't even seem sexual.  He just seems like, you know, one of those old school professional newscasters. 
[00:04:30]  You never would imagine anything like that.  It was very interesting.  Bill in Boston.  Let's start with you.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Good morning, Sam.  First of all, I think wrestling is a giant waste of time, and adults that watch it are embarrassing.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the J.R. interview.  It's an aspect that I've never really had a look at before.  All right.  Well, now that you've seen that aspect, can you cut me a little slack?  Oh, Sam.  I'm just, you know, me taking the time to call you is the slack. 
[00:05:00]  Okay.  I appreciate that, Bill.  What an honor it is to talk to Bill this morning.  Let me go to Snowy in Michigan, a real honorable man.  Hey, Samuel.  How are you doing today, sir?  Good, Snowy.  Hey, I had to make a little comment on the J.R.  First off, big attaboy for Eric for getting Scott Shannon on there.  Oh, yeah.  And we'll be playing clips of that because that was enormous.  Fucking cool, man.  Yeah.  The J.R. thing, one thing that, they went to the drug discussion about, you know,  they asked why these guys died young, and they mentioned the drug thing. 
[00:05:30]  And he almost put the onus on the athletes, the wrestlers, for getting in the drug,  picked up on drugs.  And almost, you know, said, well, WAD didn't have anything to do with it.  But I kind of disagree in a sense that a lot of those wrestlers take painkillers  and a lot of medication to try to keep wrestling when the pressure's on.  They can't take any time off.  So those guys get hooked on the painkillers.  And it's kind of a vicious circle.  I mean, you've got to keep wrestling if you don't.  No, I mean, that's true to some extent.  But there's a lot of wrestlers that don't get addicted.  And there's a lot of wrestlers that put away their money. 
[00:06:00]  Like, you know, people who end up like Mickey Rourke living in a trailer in the movie The Wrestler  and addicted to pain pills and stuff like that.  I mean, a lot of those guys are not the most responsible people to begin with.  Yeah, but, I mean, there's also a lot of pressure to keep up, you know, your level of performance.  And if it drops off at all, because...  All right, well, when a rock star ODs, because he's trying to, you know, keep him...  Because he's all coked up, because he has to perform every night, because he's on tour. 
[00:06:30]  Well, I think it's a little different.  I mean, a rock star doesn't have to take painkillers.  I mean, a rock star has a little bit different situation.  Yeah, they're all coked up.  I mean, that's way worse for your heart.  All right, Snowy.  I can't get into the argument, because I've got to play more clips.  But I appreciate the call.  Have a good day, man.  Well, we've got to keep it honest here, don't we, Sal?  JR, he was talking...  I don't have a clip of him talking about the drug thing.  He got into that a little bit.  But what I do have, and this was, I think, the type of stuff that people find interesting.  Whether you like wrestling or not, everybody knows who Vince McMahon is.  And everybody knows the idea of doing commentary, right? 
[00:07:00]  Everybody knows the idea of sports commentary.  You don't think that there's a guy like Vince McMahon yelling at you in your headphones as you're doing commentary.  When you hear these guys announcing sports or professional wrestling, you don't think that there's a Vince McMahon type screaming at them as they're talking to you at home.  But JR talked a little bit about this.  Let's go to track seven, Sal.  It's hard to get along with him when you work with him every day.  He's a...  Vince?  Yeah.  Yeah, Vince is a...  I just thought of Vince. 
[00:07:30]  I said, he's hard to get along with.  And we were talking about two guys.  So if I was on the headset right now, he'd say, God damn it.  Don't use pronouns.  I need names.  He used to be on the headset.  Like, you'd hear him in your ear as you're trying to do a...  Producer, yeah.  ...a broadcast.  Well, Mick Foley told us, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Mick told us some fun stuff.  Oh, yeah.  He was brutal.  He was...  It makes it hard to do your job, I would think.  It is challenging.  Because you're hearing your partner.  You're hearing you, you know, in your cans. 
[00:08:00]  Yep.  So the ambient noise of the audience, you're trying to pay attention to your monitor, and  you've got the most powerful man in the world who signs your checks and can control your  career at a snap of a finger with a...  You know, it sounds like you just gargle with Drano in one ear.  Yeah.  You know.  It just seems impossible, the whole thing.  Peter on Long Island.  Hey, Sam.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  How you doing?  This is not a question so much as a point.  I noticed during the interview, a couple of times, at least twice, Jim Roberts wasn't 
[00:08:30]  sure of something, and he looked to you for clarification, just like Opie.  So it was weird.  You were sort of a monitor slash, like, I don't know, a manager of the situation.  I was proud of you, buddy.  I think you're coming up.  Thank you very much.  I'm looked at as the voice of reason across many circles.  When people need the facts, they come to Sam Roberts.  That's why I'm in charge of the pre-show, because I got to make sure everybody knows  the facts of what's going on here on the Opie and Anthony show before the show kicks  off. 
[00:09:00]  Not many people could handle it, but they needed a professional broadcaster, and that's  why they got me.  You know why they get Opie and Anthony?  Because they get guys like J.R. talking about people like Vince McMahon sharting.  And a video of this ended up on Opie's YouTube channel, which is up at youtube.com slash  opiradio.  But I feel like this was the story that turned everybody around, even if people didn't like  what J.R. was talking about.  Once he got to this story, there wasn't one listener to this show that didn't enjoy it.  Here is the Vince sharting story. 
[00:09:30]  Doing live TV.  He's waiting on his music cue to make his walk to the ring.  And so he turns his back to Briscoe to deposit something a little in the air, and it got liquid.  Oh, he shit himself.  And he sharted.  Sharted, of course.  He sharted.  But it still stunk.  And Briscoe still almost fell out of a chair holding his stomach in dry heaving.  So he got mission accomplished, except he's wearing khakis, and he's got a brown stain. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, no.  You know, the old racing skid mark.  Yeah.  And he's got to go out and do his bit.  So they told the truck, and the truck started laughing.  And, of course, nobody had the balls in the truck to shoot it.  They got to shoot around Vince's.  No, you got to shoot it.  They were afraid to shoot it.  They didn't want to be looking for the warning.  Stories like that that make everything worthwhile.  It's those little gems. 
[00:10:30]  Like, I was hanging out with JR, like, all Saturday night after his big one-man show at  the Gramercy, which went really well.  But it's stories like that that I would hang out with him every day, all day.  Just in case, every now and then, a little gem about something like Vince McMahon sharding  will come up.  Well, 20 minutes away from the Obi and Anthony show.  And we're going to get into it.  I mean, we have guests today, too.  Jim Ross was Friday, and, of course, another big guest went down Friday.  Kevin in South Carolina.  Hey, Sam. 
[00:11:00]  Good morning.  First of all, there's no black ice in South Carolina today, so Jimmy should be happy.  I want to talk about Scott and Todd.  I think Scott is off-limits from the Knuckleheads after Friday's performance.  That was classic.  That was just a great radio.  Well, Scott Shannon, who's been the radio partner of Todd Pettengale for years, and,  I mean, he just got destroyed by the Obi and Anthony Knuckleheads.  It used to be that Scott got it worse than Todd.  We spent all last week making fun of Todd, who's now doing his own show. 
[00:11:30]  We find out that Scott is also doing his own show.  And Scott, I don't know if Todd could pull this off, but Scott pulled it off.  Eric Erock, Nagel, got him on the phone with the Obi and Anthony show.  And it was amazing, wasn't it, Kevin?  Yeah.  Before, I know you've got to cut me off, but one thing I think is funny.  All last week I found it hilarious.  That, like, during October they could shut the Facebook down.  Yeah.  But it's impossible to shut down a hashtag. 
[00:12:00]  It's impossible.  There's nothing they could do about it.  So I was rolling all week.  So thank you, Kevin.  Have a good day, man.  You too, buddy.  Yeah, that's the thing about the hashtag is you can shut a Facebook down so the fans can't see it.  But the Todd show was trending nationwide on Twitter multiple times last week.  And they can block as many people as they want.  But the point is the four people that listen to the Todd show and have Twitter are going to be clicking that Todd show hashtag when it pops up on the trend list. 
[00:12:30]  And all they're going to see is penises and Nazi paraphernalia and just the worst things imaginable.  But Scott Shannon, who's just taken it in the ass from this show for years, called in to O&A, one of the ballsiest moves I've ever seen.  Let's go right to track 12, Sal.  This was Scott Shannon from Scott and Todd on the Opie and Anthony show for the first time ever. 
[00:13:00]  We've got a legend on the phone line.  Yes.  Mr. Scott Shannon.  Scott.  I think this proves that I'm an effin' idiot.  I am an effin' idiot.  Not at all.  Let me just read this to you.  All right.  Go ahead, Scott.  Hello.  We were wondering if Scott would be available for a phone interview with Opie and Anthony to promote your debut on your new station.  Right.  It would be a totally serious interview and not an attack or anything negative. 
[00:13:30]  Who the hell would write that?  Nagle wrote out.  Nagle.  You think I'm an effin' idiot?  Oh, they've been a supporter of Scott's and respect for me.  He's laughing.  You know how amazing it was after all the years of talking about Scott on the show?  First of all, to hear that voice, I think that that voice, in the context of being on this show, means more to O&A listeners than it ever did to Scott and Todd listeners. 
[00:14:00]  As much time as we've spent on him.  And to finally hear that man, in that voice, reference E-Rock as Nagle as many times as Jim has done the Scott voice referencing Nagle.  To hear Scott Shannon go, that was Dan Nagle wrote that letter.  It was just amazing.  I mean, it was the moment of the show for me.  Let's go to some more calls here on the pre-show.  Ben in Australia.  Sammy.  Welcome, Ben.  You're listening live right now? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, that's what I do, man.  Look, you've got to tell me.  I was just calling you to check what the boost was that you had in your Nutri-Bullet today.  I mean, is it oats, chia seeds, or some shit?  Where are we at?  Oh, jeez.  Ben, I don't mean to disappoint you.  I know you're calling from several continents away.  But they panicked on Sunday, and they thought there was going to be a giant snowstorm in New York.  So they had a couple of us stay in hotels overnight.  So I had to stay in a hotel, even though there's just a dusting of snow.  And Ben, all the way in Australia, I did not bring my Nutri-Bullet system with me to the hotel. 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I mean, it would have been chia seed.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry, Ben.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Have a good one.  All right.  Enjoy Australia, buddy.  And I really hate to disappoint you guys.  You know I do.  Let's go to Thomas in Texas.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How you doing, buddy?  Good.  I think you all need to have Scott Shannon in the studio in October if you all do the Todd show.  Yeah, I kind of want Scott Shannon to come in and just start smashing Todd. 
[00:15:30]  Because you could hear it a little bit in the phone call.  He couldn't say it.  But you know he thinks Todd is shitty for everything.  And, well, let's play some more Scott clips.  Let's listen to Scott talking about how funny he finds O&A.  That's track 13.  The kind of humor you guys have.  You know, he always cracks me up.  And I love the sound effects.  And the way you bang on people is funny.  And it's always funny, totally Hugh. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Then I don't find it so funny.  Oh, no.  Not quite as amusing.  Right.  Who knew he had such a good sense of humor?  What was he doing on that show?  Who knew?  And then we start asking him all the questions that O&A fans want to know.  We want to know if the tree on the house, all the quotes that we've ever said about him over and over again, got back to him.  Let's play the track.  Can you just say, I got a tree on my house, please?  Are you ready?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I got a tree on my house.  Oh, that's a different one.  Yeah, I got a tree on my house, motherfucker.  I want to see the boat moving.  I got a tree on my house.  People.  Here's what happens.  See, at times, as you get a little older, you have memory dropouts.  Oh, man.  That's exactly what happens.  I'm better on some days than I am on others.  All right.  Did the whole I got a tree on my house thing get back to you from us?  Oh, he didn't blow up pretty yet. 
[00:17:00]  Here's the great part.  If I find it funny, it's either than Bobby is funny.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, but I don't think Todd could pull off what Scott did.  Scott called up, and he made fans out of O&A.  He gained respect from the room, from the Opie and Anthony show.  And I think all the listeners now respect Scott.  Scott, I don't think – see, with the O&A fans, the knuckleheads, as they were dubbed by MC Search, 
[00:17:30]  there's a hunger.  There's a bloodlust for the O&A knuckleheads.  They want to attack something.  And so all you need to do is give them the slightest reason.  For instance, Todd going on his show and saying,  Are you serious, XM, leads to weeks-long attacks.  It's unnecessary, but it's true.  I don't think that the guys – anybody wants to attack Scott anymore.  It's amazing what he did.  With one 10-minute phone call, he completely veered all of the attackers away from him. 
[00:18:00]  And I wonder this, and this is what really made me think.  I was like, well, Todd should try to call now.  If Todd wants all the attacks to go away, Todd should call in and try to be cool with the guys.  But I just don't think Todd's cool.  I don't think that Todd could ever pull that off.  I think if Todd called in, they would do one of the things where they kind of made fun of him on the phone,  and then he would hang up, and then Opie and Anthony would instruct the knuckleheads to still attack him, 
[00:18:30]  as if it had never happened.  They just used it as a moment to get their shots in.  Well, Scott Shannon and E-Rock, I guess, being the MVPs of the day on Friday,  we didn't even remember that we finally heard from Taylor from Cosmo Radio.  If you remember, during the first Super Show back in December,  I brought Sandy Cain and Lady Di and Stalker Patty into Taylor's Cosmo Radio show  because she was having an open-door policy Christmas party. 
[00:19:00]  And I said, all right, if it's open-door, can I bring some friends?  She goes, yeah, whoever you got, I can do radio with anyone.  And I go, okay.  And I brought in Lady Di, and Lady Di started talking about her baby daddy jumping in front of a train.  And I brought in Stalker Patty, who was just Stalker Patty-ing it up.  And I brought in Sandy Cain, who showed Taylor her genital wart that we named Twato.  And we finally got to hear from Taylor on the show on Friday  what it was like to see Twato up close and personal. 
[00:19:30]  But show her, go to the money shot.  Twato?  Yeah, you have to see Twato.  Oh, no.  You have to see Twato.  You just have to.  What?  What is it?  That's Twato.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  That is a growth.  It's a jellyfish.  Near a very sensitive area.  That's disgusting.  I know it is.  You guys are appalling.  No.  It wasn't me.  I swear it wasn't me.  We didn't do that.  I didn't even want to do that.  Show her Twato.  And so this woman is walking towards me, and I'm like in the corner hiding. 
[00:20:00]  I'm like, please, I don't want to see anything near your vagina.  It's terrible.  I don't want to see Twato.  I thought it was like inside her vagina.  Why is it named something?  They named it.  We had a name.  You never saw Total Recall with Quato, that little thing that comes out?  Wait, I did see Total Recall.  Yeah, it's like a little life thing that comes out of them.  It's Quato.  So we figured it was near her vagina, so we call it Twato.  It looked like a little clever.  And as it turns out, Taylor's like best friends with a chick from Vanderpump Rules.  I don't know what that show is, but yeah, yeah, our intern, the girl intern, Becky, we named her, is a big fan of Vanderpump Rules. 
[00:20:30]  Is that right?  Yeah, I'm a fan.  Yeah, well, she was in here as Taylor's best friend on Friday.  But look, today, we've done all this time talking about everything that happened on Friday.  Today, Brian Green is going to be on the show.  He's a big-time physicist, but not like a physicist teacher.  He's like in the Neil deGrasse Tyson school and Bill Nye school of figuring out a way to make physics, which is like obscenely, mind-blowingly interesting when told by the right person, told by the right person. 
[00:21:00]  Brian Green is that right person, so he will be on the show to blow our minds.  I wonder if Mr. Wizard realizes what opportunity he squandered.  Mr. Wizard used to just do stupid physics-like pranks on Nickelodeon, but he never really got into shit.  Like now, like Michio Kaku and Brian Green and Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye are like blowing our minds. 
[00:21:30]  I hope physics teachers are watching these people and realizing we can teach our children better.  And Cesar Millan is going to be here, the dog whisperer himself.  Cesar Millan is going to be on the show.  I think we're going to try to get Roland to start behaving well.  I don't know if that's why we brought him on for sure or not, but either way, I'm going to have to write some production for him to go tsk, tsk, tsk. 
[00:22:00]  It works.  I've seen it work on dogs.  It'll work on Roland.  But Cesar Millan will be here later on on today's Opie and Anthony show.  But we're going to have to get right into stuff today because last night was the Academy Awards, and I talked about it a little bit at the top of the show.  But what a night for live tweeting.  Opie was on fire.  Anthony was on fire.  Jim was on fire.  Now, Anthony, his style of live tweeting is to just disregard anybody that could be offended by anything, which I love. 
[00:22:30]  It's just – I wouldn't write half the stuff he writes, but I wish I could.  I think that's Anthony's strongest suit on Twitter, that he writes things that people wish they could get away with.  I mean, he was just attacking Precious last night.  I mean, every other tweet from him was talking about how large and in charge Precious was at the Academy Awards.  And I think the Academy Awards are doing it on purpose because if you remember, there was a whole to-do about fat-shaming the last time people were making fun of Precious. 
[00:23:00]  I mean, they even got Jay Moore in trouble for fat-shaming Alyssa Milano.  But they took Precious and they put her on stage next to Anna Kendrick, who was in the movie Pitch Perfect, and she's like the tiniest, cutest, young, new actress that Hollywood has to offer.  There couldn't have been a larger juxtaposition. 
[00:23:30]  And I know people hate it when I use that word, but there couldn't have been a larger juxtaposition between her and Precious.  It was almost as if they were daring people to call Precious large, and boy did Anthony.  What struck me, you know you've gone to a certain place when Jim Norton has to go on his Twitter and reference how mean you are in a good way.  One of Norton's tweets was actually, you are mean and hilarious, Anthony Cumia. 
[00:24:00]  So we'll get into all that, the Academy Awards.  Of course, John Travolta and his painted-on hair and his inability to pronounce a name was a big story.  Bill Murray giving Harold Ramis the shout-out.  Matthew McConaughey and Lupita and Kim Novak freaking everybody out.  It was a, I mean, it was a very boring show, but there was plenty to make fun of.  And God damn, was it long.  But, we'll get into all of it on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:24:30]  Other big news that went down on Friday, oh, while we're talking about guests, I wanted to play this.  Colin Quinn, another great call from Colin Quinn on Friday.  He's basically, he's trying to take Opie and Anthony to interview school.  I've never seen Colin Quinn do an interview.  So I don't know how he became the expert.  But the reason why I love this is because he's the only guy that I've ever seen Opie and Anthony allow to be given the business from. 
[00:25:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, he's the only person that can call up, criticize Opie and Anthony, and Opie and Anthony will almost take it as constructive criticism.  Like, they'll learn from it instead of just telling him to shut the fuck up.  Here's Colin Quinn's call from Friday.  Hi, guys.  I'm prepared, though.  I'm prepared.  I'm prepared for this call ever since the beginning of the week when you interviewed Mandela.  I mean, Ted Lange.  I figured out what you guys could do. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  Yeah.  It all started when I started hearing you guys, well, you know, he rambles all the stories.  Right.  That's when you guys have to cut him off.  Well, it's hard sometimes.  We had a tough time doing that today with Mr. Jim Ross.  Jim Ross, exactly.  Exactly.  You have a tough time doing it anyway.  I figured out you guys could have, I hate to use the old umbrella, low self-esteem.  You guys have such a low self-esteem.  I'd like to listen to all your interviews with just you guys talking and not the guests. 
[00:26:00]  There's a way to do that.  And you would think every guest with a combination, maybe, feel, cancer-curing doctors.  It's unbelievable.  You say we pander to the guests.  I'll tell you something, though, Colin.  And I don't think this is fair, because I think everyone reached out to you on Twitter  to tell you about the Ted Lange interview.  And you went back and listened to it just so you could beat us up.  You did not hear that interview live. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, is that funny?  Mandela.  Well, it may be a valid point.  Okay.  It's so great.  Colin Quinn, he calls up on his own randomly.  And Obi takes the call every time to his credit.  I know everybody behind the scenes, all of us, love when Colin Quinn calls in.  And I think that's mainly because we all walk around in fear of screwing up every moment.  So whenever anybody can give it back to O&A, it's just fucking awesome.  The Colonel in Georgia.  Hey, Sam. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, welcome to the pre-show.  About, what is it now, three minutes ago.  Yeah, just about three and a half.  And I hope that the physicists are watching this today.  How do you watch something on the radio?  I want you to know something, Colonel.  I expect a focused audience.  And what I mean by focused is I don't want you listening in the periphery.  When the O.B. and Anthony show is on, if you're driving, I want you pulled over and staring at your radio. 
[00:27:30]  So you get every detail that we have to offer.  You understand?  That's what I was getting at.  Okay, I got it, Sam.  Love you, buddy.  Thank you, buddy.  Nick in Niagara Falls.  Hey, Sam.  Good morning.  What's up, buddy?  I just woke up and started looking at Twitter.  And I'm seeing these tweets from Todd's Army, which is, I guess, Todd's actual Twitter account.  And I will read this tweet here.  Apparently, it's been deleted since.  But it says, the Todd show is going so well.  Bring it on, dopey and scampson-y. 
[00:28:00]  This is war.  Hashtag Team Todd.  Yeah, I saw a photo of that tweet, a screen grab of it, earlier this morning.  I really hope it's real, because if it's real, you know how we're going to respond.  But I don't have confirmation that it's real.  I don't know if somebody just photoshopped it.  Okay, well, I'm going to...  But good call, Nick.  We are going to be looking into that.  Okay, great.  Thanks, buddy.  Kyle on Long Island.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, how's it going, Sam?  Good morning. 
[00:28:30]  Good.  All right, I got something for you guys.  Totally off topic from what we're talking about this morning.  But if you get a chance, I know how you guys hate the phone scams.  There is a John Cena phone scam, and I think it's pretty hysterical.  Actually, someone hit it on the head with this one.  And if you ever get time during today and you're bored, play it for the gentleman.  I think they'll think it's hysterical.  Now, I'm going to look it up.  I'm not going to take your word for it, because it very well might be fake.  We got into surprise weigh-ins on Friday with Eric and Roland. 
[00:29:00]  Anybody wants to catch up on what's gone on with them?  Let's find out what Eric's weight was.  Iraq lost 11 pounds down to 236, losing 4.5%.  That was a week ago.  He was at 236.  Now off the diet for a week.  Where is he at?  After seven days, he has lost, I mean, gained one pound.  Yeah.  But that fluctuates.  Yeah, it fluctuates.  So he's 237.  There's a pound.  That was a pizza. 
[00:29:30]  That was the pizza.  Pizza will put a pound on you pretty quick.  Yeah.  I'm maintaining.  Yeah, but don't you want to keep losing?  No, you're not in the maintaining stage yet.  I just jumped right to it.  I've hit my ideal weight.  You're not maintaining yet.  You're supposed to still be losing.  You're supposed to keep losing.  That's so great.  I love Iraq.  He is America.  Yeah, I'm on a diet, but I'm maintaining.  At least I'm not gaining weight on my diet.  Harley in Georgia.  Hey, man, I just want to give you a props. 
[00:30:00]  I didn't catch it until I listed Encore this morning.  You had a line from Aladdin.  You said, show you a whole new world.  And they said, don't you dare close your eyes.  Man, I almost fell out of the truck, man, when I heard that.  They're snuck in there for everybody.  They're snuck in there.  Okay, look.  Something's going on on the O.B. and Anthony show right now.  Oh, Jim spilled his coffee.  I wish we'd been on the air for that.  I love when Jim spills things.  He's such a clumsy boy sometimes.  Well, also, Roland.  We don't have time to play the clip today.  But Roland gained, I think Roland's up five pounds. 
[00:30:30]  But he said it's okay because it's celebratory.  And I agree.  Well, Jim, it looks like he spilled his entire cup of coffee all over the place.  The interns are running in to clean this up.  Will we have it clean in time for the Opie and Anthony show?  Let's find out right now.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:31:00]  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time for the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:36:00]  That's better.  That's better, huh?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What do you think?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's all cleaned up now.  Yeah.  Not everywhere.  Much better.  Everywhere.  And there's papers.  Oh, it went everywhere.  Everywhere, but inside my mouth.  Can I have a tissue?  Jimmy, can I have a tissue?  Yeah, just throw the whole box over here.  Please.  Thank you.  Got to clean my phone.  Clean your phone. 
[00:37:30]  Obama phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring.  Man, I don't know why anyone would stay up for four hours or whatever the hell for the Oscars.  I don't.  And then go to work the next day.  It's so stupid.  It's just not a fun show to watch.  You get caught up live tweeting some of these events, and then you feel like,  Yeah, why'd I bother?  And then by the time they mentioned Best Picture, I just didn't care. 
[00:38:00]  Who gave a shit?  I didn't care.  At that point.  There's an hour in there where they could just cut that whole hour out.  Exactly.  And then it would come in at a decent time, this damn show.  I don't know why they feel compelled to make it like this, where the host has to do things.  Right.  And it takes up a lot of time.  Just go through the show.  No one cares.  Right.  Ellen did good, though.  I like Ellen DeGeneres a lot, to be honest with you.  She's funny. 
[00:38:30]  I think she came out of the gate pretty strong.  Really strong.  She fucking made fun of Liza Minnelli.  She called Liza Minnelli a dude.  That was the line of the fucking night.  There's a billion people watching.  Yeah.  Good job, sir.  Good job, sir.  Good job, sir.  Dude, you know that was off the cuff.  There's no way that that was, because she just showed up looking like that.  She decided to just go for her.  Good for her, man.  That Liza Minnelli's a disaster.  What a pig.  I tell you, on that red carpet thing when they first showed her, I really did think it was an impersonator. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  I thought it was a Liza impersonator, one of those gay guys, you know?  Oh, her nipples were, like, pointing straight down.  She didn't wear a bra.  Big fucking coffee saucers.  Oh, God.  Were they terrible?  Huge old lady nips.  Would you, you know?  Oh, God, no.  Would you?  Just so you have a story to tell at the poker games.  Oh, God, no.  And there I was, sucking on Liza's tits.  Liza.  Me and Liza. 
[00:39:30]  How old is she?  65, maybe?  No, she's got to be older than that.  She's got to be in her 70s easily.  Right?  Yeah.  67 only?  No way.  Travis said 67.  No way.  There's no way she's only 67.  You know the big selfie pic that everyone's talking about?  Oh, yeah.  It's on the front page of our papers.  Yeah.  There's a picture from behind, you know, when everyone's, like, getting in position for the big selfie that Ellen DeGeneres decided to do?  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, there it is.  And that's Liza Videli.  Look at she's trying to get in the selfie.  Oh, she's trying to get in it.  Oh, no.  She fell a little short.  Oh, no.  Liza.  She's tiny, and then she's trying to stand, you know, as high as she can, so maybe her head pops up from the back.  She never made the selfie.  And she never made it.  She did not make it.  Oh, man.  But some dude did.  It was Lupita.  How do you say her last name?  Nyong?  Nyong?  Like, we need to know her name. 
[00:40:30]  Stop.  Old breastplate.  She's very pretty, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, face.  She has a beautiful face.  She's into that look.  Yeah, she's pretty.  I don't think we need to know her name, though.  But her brother.  She's one of those one and dones.  One off?  Yes.  Her brother jumped into, just literally couldn't have gotten a more prestigious position in that photo.  He's a nobody.  Dude, I love the fact that he did exactly what I would do.  Spoil it.  He did spoil it.  He's a complete nobody, and he got his face in at the last second. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That is great.  He's in there with this bastard.  He has a picture with Ellen Bradley Cooper.  Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt.  A little piece of Jared Leto.  Lupita's in the back.  Where's Jared Leto?  Is that him right here?  Yeah.  His eye.  Jared Leto's eye.  Who's that behind between...  Who's that hot chick there?  Is that Julia Roberts?  Yeah, Julia Roberts.  And who's that right behind...  I'm not sure.  God damn.  Some other dude.  Who's the one waving behind the brother? 
[00:41:30]  That's Angelina Jolie.  Oh, I couldn't...  Oh, her face got...  He blocked out Angelina Jolie's face?  With his dumb fucking hair.  His kid play hairdo idiot?  His kid play hair.  Fucking...  Oh, what a fucking...  What a photo bomb.  Wow.  He fucked up.  You know how mad I'd be if I was in that photo and lost Angelina Jolie because of his  head?  Because of his dumb head.  Oh, I'd be a fucking angry young man.  So...  Did everyone do well with their Oscar picks?  Ooh.  Yes.  Yeah.  I very rarely do. 
[00:42:00]  I didn't even think about picking or anything.  I can't believe Matthew McConaughey has a Oscar.  AIDS, man.  AIDS will fucking get you an Oscar.  It's just the way it is in Hollywood, right?  Am I right?  Yeah.  Those AIDS movies do really, really well.  Hollywood loves AIDS.  They really do love a good AIDS movie.  Yeah.  AIDS and slavery was like the big fucking thing.  But he won for Dallas Buyers Club, of course.  Dallas Buyers Club wins both Best Actor and Supporting Actor. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty crazy, right?  Yeah.  I didn't even see that movie.  I didn't see that one either.  Maybe I should see that movie.  Yeah.  Is it good?  And Michael Fast...  I think his name is Fastbacker.  He didn't have a chance.  Oh, this is funny.  Oh, this is funny.  They're doing their own selfie on Fox News this morning.  Is it official?  Oh, that's funny.  Is it official?  The selfie is dead.  Yes.  It's like, after all this shit.  Yes, I think so.  What were you saying, Jimmy? 
[00:43:00]  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I didn't want to miss that amazing moment.  That's a lie.  That's what live radio is all about.  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty amazing.  Michael, I think it's Fastbacker is his name.  Fastbender, I'm sorry.  He played the slave owner in 12 Years a Slave.  He was also a supporting actor.  And he was fucking Lupita in that movie.  He was fucking one of the slaves.  And he was so good, but there's no way he had a shot at winning.  No.  Because he was so brutal.  Oh, yeah.  You just knew it.  Like, against Jared Leto playing, you know, an HIV-positive transgender prostitute or whatever. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, right.  Oh, he didn't have a chance.  He didn't have a fucking chance.  Speaking of transgender prostitutes, thanks for this.  All right.  Good.  How are you?  How are you?  So then, I don't know.  I mean, what are the highlights?  Like, Ellen DeGeneres was good, but then the pizza thing was stupid.  The selfie thing was good, I guess, because it broke Twitter.  She had a couple good laughs off the pizza thing, though.  Asking Harvey Weinstein for money. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  Telling the girl her stock just went up.  Can I get out to somebody?  Yeah.  She had some decent laughs trying to get money from people.  Yeah.  She did okay.  I mean, you know.  She said the beginning was good.  This is why it's so stupid to live tweet these things.  And then you come in to do...  This is way more important than live tweeting.  You know what I mean?  There's like 10% of your followers actually see your tweets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If that.  That's kind of fun, though.  It is kind of fun.  I like reading them.  It's kind of fun to be a dick.  But then you realize everyone out there is just trying to be a dick. 
[00:44:30]  Just trying to be a dick.  Everyone is just trying to be a dick now.  That's the whole thing with live tweeting events.  Is to be a complete fucking asshole.  But you try for the laugh.  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, you know.  Okay.  Here comes Travolta.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Get a wig.  Wig joke.  Something.  Something's on his head.  Yeah.  What is that?  He likes men.  What is that?  Well, and he fucked up a name or something, right? 
[00:45:00]  He did fuck up a name.  Do we have that clip?  We could play that clip.  I think he knew he was going to fuck it up, too.  Yeah.  Because he kind of eased into saying it.  Adina.  Adina Menzel.  Menzel.  Menzel.  Menzel.  All right.  Adina Menzel.  That's the name he was supposed to say?  Yes.  He went with Adele Dazeem.  Yeah.  He took a stab at it.  He just decided, I'll try Adele Dazeem. 
[00:45:30]  Adele Dazeem.  Adele Dazeem.  Who is that?  I think that's what he said.  Let's play this.  Thank you.  I love you.  There will always be a special place in my heart for the movie musical.  That's right.  And for the songs that create their most memorable moments.  Here to perform the Oscar-nominated, gorgeously empowering song, Let It Go, from the Oscar-winning animated movie Frozen,  Please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only Adele Dazeem. 
[00:46:00]  Did he fuck that up?  Yeah.  Dazeem.  I didn't ever fuck it up.  It wasn't even close.  What's her name?  Adina Menzel.  Adina Menzel.  Adina Menzel.  Adele Dazeem.  Dazeem.  Idiot.  Adele Dazeem.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  From the Oscar-winning animated movie Frozen, please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only Adele Dazeem. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, what is that?  How bad would it be for him if he just said it finally?  How bad could it be in this day and age?  What is he doing?  Just say it.  Just say it.  Adele Dazeem.  Look at this photo of somebody tweeted.  Oh, he's got dreamy eyes.  Travolta's scoping out his next victim.  Who's that right in front of him?  I don't remember his name.  Cumberbatch.  Oh, right.  But Cumberbatch, is that his name? 
[00:47:00]  Cumber...  Yeah, I think so.  Cumberbatch.  That John Travolta hair is fucking strange, man.  It's just, he could change it.  It's amazing.  He has long hair.  He's got tattooed on his head hair.  Right.  He's fucking balding.  He's got full head of hair.  What is that, though?  It's just a supply of wigs.  It's just a nice, solid wig, huh?  He's like Lex Luthor.  He's probably got a bunch of fucking wigs on those wig heads around his house.  They got the wigs figured out.  Yeah, that looks pretty good for him.  If he didn't know he didn't have hair, he probably figures... 
[00:47:30]  You would still be guessing, oh, wait, what's going on there?  He probably figures, you know, when I do movies, they throw these fucking rugs on my head and I walk around in the movie looking like I got a head of hair.  Right.  So why don't I just do that in real life?  Every day is a new role for John.  It's something.  Yeah.  Big head of hair.  Everyone knows the winners, right?  Yeah, right.  Supporting actor Jared Leto.  You got the Cate Blanchett for the Blue Jasmine.  She mentioned the Woody Allen. 
[00:48:00]  The W word.  She mentioned the Woody Allen.  What a smattering of nerve-wracked applause that brought up.  They feel like, hey, now, Woody Allen.  I don't think the cameras went into the audience at that point.  No, it didn't.  No.  They didn't want to know.  Did he fuck?  That's a rough one to clap.  Yeah, good movies.  He might have fucked a seven-year-old.  Yeah, great movie.  He might have fucked a seven-year-old.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a big...  Yeah, that was a rough one.  Yeah.  I didn't realize how beautiful Cate Blanchett was. 
[00:48:30]  Cate Blanchett.  She's really fucking beautiful.  She, uh...  She's a very Hollywood look.  Yeah.  She's a very Hollywood look to her.  Then the Lupita Broad won 12 Years a Slave for the supporting actress.  She got up there and gave a little crying.  Right.  And then a lot of awards for Gravity.  All those technical ones.  A bunch of technical awards.  All those directing also for Gravity.  Right.  But you got the sound mixing, the sound editing, the original score, the cinematography. 
[00:49:00]  I saw that movie again.  Film editing.  Over the weekend, Gravity.  Visual effects all for Gravity, yeah.  And I didn't like it even more.  You didn't like it, huh?  Yeah, I was like, ah, you know what?  It just looked great.  It looks good, technically, but once you get over that, you know, there's really nothing there.  It's just kind of a boring fucking movie.  What about The Frog?  The Frog?  Yeah.  What about The Frog?  Oh.  Have you figured that out in Gravity? 
[00:49:30]  No.  Remember you were bringing that out?  Yeah, I remember, Sam.  Trust me.  I'm obsessed.  I remember.  I'm obsessed with The Frog in Gravity.  That's what I thought.  Could I have a bottle of water if you try not to spill it on the way over there, Jim?  Thank you, sir.  Where was George Clooney?  Oh, yeah.  Where was George Clooney?  I mean, big picture.  You know it's going to win all sorts of technical awards, and one of the big stars wasn't even  there.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you be there just to show a little support?  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Was he a producer on it, too?  I don't know.  They're always producing these movies.  Yeah.  Where's George?  Hashtag.  Do they want to give the illusion that he actually is still just floating away?  Oh, maybe that's it.  Maybe that's it.  They didn't want to wreck it.  They didn't want to ruin it.  Hey, that's George Clooney.  Yeah.  I thought he was floating away.  That's what fucked me up.  Like Sandra Bullock, you could go, all right, she's playing a female astronaut.  You sort of could get into it.  But George Clooney, you're like, wow, George Clooney in space.  Hey, it's George Clooney in space.  Like, he didn't even try to go with an accent or try to change his look at all. 
[00:50:30]  Or his attitude.  He was just the...  It was George Clooney.  It was George Clooney in space.  But that astronaut's going to rob a casino next.  Right.  Look out.  Must be nice to just be George Clooney in a movie.  Yeah.  We don't have to fucking really work on anything.  That was easy.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a big bitch.  Man.  Oh, yeah.  That is a big bitch.  Oh, speaking of that.  Yes.  Which one?  Fucking Gabby.  Dude, you...  Precious.  I'm sure you got attacked, too, man. 
[00:51:00]  Twitter doesn't like the fat joke.  Oh, fuck them.  Twitter does not like the fat joke.  They sure don't.  Yeah.  Look, my whole opinion on that whole thing, you know, you could be a bit large or whatever,  but she is completely out of control.  Out of control fat.  She's too young to be that out of control fat.  There you go.  She's morbidly obese.  Yes.  She absolutely is.  But, man, you point that out.  Twitter does not like it.  Yeah, there were a few people getting upset.  I just retweet when they get upset with me and let the listeners deal with it. 
[00:51:30]  It was a little insensitive for you to post this photo of Gabby on the red carpet with  the caption, 12 years of slob.  That's very good.  That made me laugh out loud.  I got a little traction.  Oh, my God.  And then she's cursed with no boobs.  She's a flatso.  Usually when you get a fat girl like that, at least you got the giant ones.  Yeah, yeah.  She looks like a lint roller for the red carpet or something.  Can we spray this microphone?  Does your mic stink?  Oh, it stinks.  It ain't for me. 
[00:52:00]  I fucking said five words into it.  Before I talked, I said, I know what I said.  Oh, my God.  Didn't Mars use to spray these?  Mars?  He used to.  Comment.  Mars is.  Stop spraying these.  Kaiser Sosay.  That's hilarious.  There you go.  Fucking release.  Oh, my God.  Who was using that microphone?  Now I got the heebie-jeebies.  Why don't you use that one?  Why don't you use that one?  Oh, man.  Calm down.  Try that.  Stop your spilling it.  Now you got us all paranoid.  By the way, I want to get one of my own of these. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just use my own fucking mic.  Just bring it in every day.  Yes.  Your little mic windscreen.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Oh, that's better.  Somebody else's mouth right on it.  It is right on it all the time.  Look at how germ infested.  It's a perfect little home for germs.  Comedy club mics.  I try never to smell.  You get one whiff of them, and it's just all dried spits.  It could ruin your day, right?  It makes the funny right out of the night.  I should say.  There's pieces of food in the mesh.  He's ready to vomit. 
[00:53:00]  It's fucking terrible, man.  It's so bad.  You ever see a little piece of carrot or meat in the fucking mesh?  Oof.  I would think they would have came up with a better design for that.  Yeah, yeah.  It catches all little food particles.  You've got to talk into it.  Speaking of microphones, I want to wish Scott Shannon nothing but the best of luck today.  Scott Shannon as he starts his solo show for CBS FM here in New York City.  He was working with Todd, and Todd didn't want him, and he knew that.  He brings Todd on, and Todd thinks he can do the show by himself. 
[00:53:30]  Scott Shannon.  I've never seen anyone turn an entire audience around in one phone call.  Amazing, right?  Our listeners love Scott Shannon because of that 17-minute phone call on Friday.  It was a great appearance.  They absolutely love the guy now.  Great appearance by Scott.  He went with it.  He had a good time.  Yeah.  And he had a lot of freaking one-liners in there.  He was funny, man.  Really funny.  He was good.  He was really good.  Self-deprecating. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  He was fucking funny, man.  If you haven't heard that phone call, we played it all weekend, but...  We were just playing clips on the pre-show, too.  You were?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good, good.  How's he doing this morning?  I heard his first break as I was walking through.  Like we said Friday after that phone call, I'm out.  I think the whole show is out.  We're done.  Yeah.  It's Team Scott.  Team Scott.  We want to play clips to just congratulate him on John.  Yes.  There's no reason to listen to him and try to beat the crap out of him.  He was a great sport on Friday. 
[00:54:30]  Did he sound energized on the air?  He did.  He sounds older, but he sounds much more energetic than he said on the Scott and Todd show.  Absolutely.  So the listeners are now like they're all into like Todd and Scott.  Is that it?  No.  How's that?  No.  That's the only Scott they like?  Just Scott.  Just like Scott.  They didn't turn around.  I know he called, but...  You missed it.  It was unbelievable, Jimmy.  They turned all their hatred towards...  I didn't know what to expect. 
[00:55:00]  You know, Eric was working on it all morning and then it happened and I just didn't know  how it was going to go down.  If it was going to be ugly or sad.  I was pleasantly surprised how great that was.  You know how amazing it was to hear him refer to E-Rock as Nagel the way Jim's impression of Scott refers to Eric as Nagel?  I didn't read Nagel.  Nope.  Right.  Nagel.  Nagel.  It's a Nagel.  By the way, the boat movie didn't win any awards.  No.  That poor guy goes back to driving calves now. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I don't know what...  I think Lupita will get more work if she's hot, but I don't see what he's going to get.  He's got a role.  Oh, does he?  That's something.  He's going to play a marathon runner.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to run far.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I hear at the end there's a lot of controversy because he wins by a tooth.  See?  The finish line.  His tooth.  He keeps trying to get his catchphrase in, but it doesn't work anymore. 
[00:56:00]  I am the winner now.  No, no.  That worked on the captain, but it's not good anymore.  He tries to ad-lib.  Oh, you're on to something.  Fast forward another year, he's going to be working that line into local commercials.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm the captain now.  Yeah.  I am the captain of good mattresses.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  It's not even going to be national spots, though.  It's going to be kind of local.  Local.  Like a car dealership.  Right.  Oh, shit. 
[00:56:30]  That guy should have done something.  He had some time to do something about them choppers.  Wow.  Those teeth are pretty brutal.  I don't know what that is.  That.  The gums.  The whole damn thing.  Yeah.  Those before Oscar interviews are fucking unwatchable.  What?  The red carpet thing?  Oh, my.  Ponderous.  What are you wearing?  Oh.  They just talk about what they're wearing?  There's got to be a better way to do that, right?  Uh, it's the same thing every year with the, you know, what are you wearing? 
[00:57:00]  Who cares?  Right.  No one really gives a shit.  No.  Who do they have, uh, what's his name?  Rob Ford on Kimmel.  Kimmel picked him up.  Oh, yeah.  At the airport.  Yeah.  God does answer your prayers if you pray hard enough.  Tomorrow night, Mayor Ford and Gonzo from the Muppets will be here together, so it'll be fun.  Yeah, so Kimmel wins the booking war.  Yeah, but Kimmel's getting his ass kicked.  Is he?  I mean, it's still early, but even if Jimmy Fallon loses half of his audience, because 
[00:57:30]  everyone's watching Jimmy Fallon because it's brand new, he still will have a huge lead  over the rest of them.  He did seven and a half million last week.  Wow.  Seven and a half million, and the other guys were doing what?  Uh, high twos, mid twos?  Damn.  So even if he loses half of that, he's still got a strong lead.  Because obviously the numbers are going to drop a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  It'll probably drop a lot.  Just heal the curiosity they're watching.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  But Kimmel's already, not Kimmel, uh, Fallon's killing it.  And Kimmel getting robbed for it, and I'm like, and then he picks him up at the airport, 
[00:58:00]  and I'm like, that's a funny, creative thing to do.  Like, he's got some really smart people writing for him.  Yep.  Not as funny as what Fallon did.  What did he do?  Oh, that fucking lake thing?  He did the polar plunge in Chicago in a full suit.  To get Rahm Emanuel on the show, right?  Yep.  He went in in a full, full suit.  He could die doing that.  I know.  What the fuck?  Did Rahm Emanuel do it to him?  Oh, yeah.  But he was, he's all in shape and was wearing, like, his I'm in shape gear.  Oh, was he?  That's what I call it, the I'm in shapes gear. 
[00:58:30]  And Fallon just went in with his suit.  Jimmy Fallon is just known for that suit at this point, right?  Yeah, I think so.  He's got a type of suit.  He's the suit guy now.  Think he was cold?  Oh, my, look at his face.  He's not faking anything.  He ran right for warm towels.  He was not happy.  Brutal.  Yeah.  It was brutally cold.  Would he do that?  No.  Have you ever tried to dip into some very cold water? 
[00:59:00]  It's not fun.  Not very cold.  It's horrible.  I can't stand it.  Was that Rahm Emanuel next to him all built or no?  Talk show host Jimmy Fallon made good on their promise.  The mayor and the Tonight Show hosts ran into Lake Michigan for the polar plunge, possibly the coldest one ever.  Eric Rung was also there, but he stayed on land.  Take a look.  In addition to being one of the coldest polar plunges, 2014 was also one of the most successful. 
[00:59:30]  The crowd was about as thick as the skin people needed to take the plunge into Lake Michigan this year.  The costumes were outrageous.  Are you scared?  A little bit.  I dressed for the occasion.  A lot of fur.  Even considering taking the dip, as you well know, is a little nutty.  Nutty.  Yeah.  Kind of fun.  Unless, of course, you're the most interesting man in the world, or perhaps happened to win a bronze medal in the Winter Olympics. 
[01:00:00]  I gotta say, that was a little bit colder than Sochi.  Oh, boy.  Right, a lot colder than Sochi.  A lot colder than Sochi.  But the real star power for this year's polar plunge had to fly here from New York.  What is wrong with you people?  Look at all you guys.  Look at what we've done.  You guys are the greatest.  Jimmy Fallon, the new Tonight Show host, took the mayor up on his invitation to take the plunge. 
[01:00:30]  The mayor even honored Fallon with a very special proclamation.  Chicago is officially Jimmy Fallon Tonight Show land, whereas, hereby, therefore.  Their appearance certainly helped to raise a record amount of money to help Special Olympians.  Oh, man, this is a wonderful experience.  I mean, everybody's out here today.  We're ready to have fun.  Oh, God.  How was that?  When the celebrity crew made his way to the water, he was standing for shoulder room only. 
[01:01:00]  How's the view from up there?  Great.  I can see everybody.  So she was able to watch the mayor and Jimmy and the rest of the crew stay true to their words.  He did it in a suit.  Yeah, they're strong.  He came out for you.  As their first legs could take them to find someplace warm.  Along with Jimmy Fallon and the mayor, more than 3,000 people took the plunge into Lake Michigan this morning, raising more than a million dollars for Special Olympics. 
[01:01:30]  We're at North Avenue Beach.  I'm Eric Rung, WGN News.  Why does the money go to Special Olympics?  I don't know.  I guess that's their charity.  Probably you'd have to be.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  That's their charity?  I guess so.  Yeah, they're doing something nice.  What the hell?  Dude, I would rather do it naked than in a suit.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  By that, I mean have sex.  Oh.  See?  I'm very cheeky.  But no, you know how your shirt gets wet and it's just that fucking feeling?  The cold.  Oh, that would sting.  Wet. 
[01:02:00]  I bet they whisked him off to somewhere where he could dry off very quickly.  What do the regular people do?  They've got to stand around.  No, they have to be able to change somewhere.  Where?  Don't they have a hot tent?  There's thousands and thousands of people.  Yeah.  Where are you going to go?  Yeah, where are you going to go?  I don't know.  I'd find a place.  Oh, man.  I'm sure they have some things set up, but not everyone's going to be able to take advantage  of that.  Yeah.  You've got to sit there and change it to warm clothes.  Just take it.  And just shiver for about an hour until that calms down. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  When your body decides to start shivering, man, it'll let you know when it's ready to calm  down.  I don't even like when the water starts getting a little cold in the shower.  Really?  You know, when you run out, you start running out.  You're like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Anything worse than having to take a cold shower because your hot water sucks or something?  Hot water isn't working and you know you have to do it.  And you don't find out until the morning.  Oh, yeah.  It's the worst.  I won't shower.  What I do is I jump in because my head doesn't usually stink.  It's just my fucking asshole.  So I'll jump in the shower and I'll prop my ass up on the thing and I'll soap my balls 
[01:03:00]  and asshole real quick.  Just poke your ass out into the stream of cold water and go, ooh.  Yeah, but I'll keep my head and face just dirty.  That just smells like someone else's asshole.  So what were you saying about that beach ball?  That's where we went with the Oscars.  Oh, I was just saying, like, she's got to know.  Like, people get mad when you make those jokes. 
[01:03:30]  She's all about ignoring the haters and saying, she's one of those I look good people.  I look good?  No.  You really don't look good.  That's just a...  You're too young to be that huge.  That's awful.  Why aren't people telling her something?  Oh, yeah.  There was a lot of pictures of her next to other things.  Yeah.  Like the Grimace.  The Grimace was the big one.  She looked like the Grimace.  That's the bear from Toy Story, right?  Toy Story.  Yeah.  And then there was another old cartoon that starred with Grape. 
[01:04:00]  That they put her next to.  They keep carting her out.  Has she done another movie since Precious?  Oh.  She did that one with the high-rise theft thing.  Oh, right.  And she did...  This year, she did American Horror Story.  Right.  Oh, I didn't see this year's.  I saw this year's.  Yeah.  Is there a lot of them?  Yeah, yeah.  She's the main character.  She did the Eddie Murphy movie.  Yeah.  That wasn't her.  Tower Heist.  Tower Heist.  Tower Heist.  That was her.  I think my nutty professor.  She's got to do something. 
[01:04:30]  But then they put her next to, like...  Did you see her on stage?  Oh, my God.  She was next to that skinny girl.  They found the smallest, youngest girl that they could find.  Yeah.  To just tempt people into making the fat jokes.  Yeah.  Yeah, the joke...  It was the perfect number 10.  I mean, it's the easiest joke to make, but...  Yep.  Anyone else notice the black-white thing? 
[01:05:00]  A lot of them.  They had a theme this year.  Yes, they did.  The presenters had to be one black, one white.  Really strange.  That was odd.  It was, like, very forced.  It was extremely forced.  It wasn't just, you know, one or two presenters.  It was a lot.  Yeah.  Did they do that?  I mean, I...  Oh, yeah.  You don't see color, Jimmy, right?  I do.  I only see color.  No, I didn't.  I saw...  I noticed it was Sidney Poitier and the...  lovely Angelina Jolie who looked fucking...  I was looking at her last night.  I'm like, she looks fucking beautiful. 
[01:05:30]  Like, I can't believe she's pumped babies out of that beautiful body.  Wow, does she look nice.  She has?  Or they're all adopted?  No, she's pumped out of a couple, I think.  Oh, yeah, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  It is possible for the woman to have her body bounce back.  Oh, my God.  Not every woman has lasagna belly after they're done.  Lasagna belly.  Oh.  You don't like that?  No.  It's terrible.  You guys leave Poitier alone?  Sidney Poitier.  Poitier Poitier. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, what are you going to say?  You would look like a complete dick.  I was trying to think of something to go with.  Were you really?  You called me Mr. Tibbs, but...  Yeah.  I just tweeted my photo with him later.  Yeah.  Just a couple of big shots.  He's an all right sort.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mr. Bob Levy.  Oh, God.  Bob.  What's up, guys?  That precious last night, when she walked out, I was like, holy shit, Bubba Smith is alive.  I never told you.  Jesus. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Bob's tweets were pretty vicious.  I liked them.  Oh, yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  You know what I mean?  You know, and it's just ridiculous, because you know damn well those fucking snobs would  not pay attention to her if she was just a regular fucking person.  Exactly.  You know, because of the way she looks and that.  But that guy with the teeth, he needs a fucking reality show.  Wouldn't you watch that?  Just watch him do things like brush his teeth.  Just him at the dentist would be amazing.  Yeah.  That could be a miniseries. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  His teeth took up two seats in that fucking theater.  I can't fucking believe that fucking guy.  They'd jump out at you like the alien teeth.  Yeah.  If you'd seen that guy in the street, wouldn't you just shoot him and think he was some kind  of fucking monster or something?  Monster.  Yeah.  How funny would it have been to just put his teeth at the end of the death montage, though?  Oh, God.  That was fucking so weird.  Even Norton said something about that last night.  It was such a weird thing, because they had some big stars that were in there, but there  was also people, you were like, who the fuck is this? 
[01:07:30]  And nobody, you know how they usually clap in that, Jim?  Yeah, they turned the sound off.  No, they turned the sound down.  People still...  Oh, they did.  Oh, absolutely.  People still clap for their favorite dead celebrity or dead star.  But somehow, people thought that wasn't cool, so they decided, let's cut the audio.  Yeah.  I used to love to see who was the most popular dead guy.  Yeah.  I bet Philip Seymour Hoffman, without a doubt.  I don't know.  You got to go Gandolfini.  I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  No, Philip Seymour Hoffman, of course, would have won that.  Because he was first Gandolfini, I think.  And it was before they turned the sound down.  You could kind of start hearing some applause.  Yeah, they were applauding before they...  It was pretty good, but I don't know.  I bet that.  I bet Harold Ramis got a pretty big ovation.  Yeah.  Gandolfini.  It was so weird to see, because it was an Oscar, so they mentioned him with the movie  that he was in.  Yeah.  Like, they don't mention him with The Sopranos.  Yeah, Sopranos.  Right.  And they did that with someone else, too.  And what was the Bette Midler thing about?  That pompous... 
[01:08:30]  Whatever.  That horrible word there.  I guess she told them she's not going to sing her wind song.  Wind Beneath My Wings.  As they're playing the death montage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they played it after.  Yeah.  But that song obviously went with the death montage.  Yeah, it should have been under the death montage.  But she went to the producers and said, look, I'll sing this song for you, but I'm not  doing it as you show all those people.  I want people to see me. 
[01:09:00]  So then it turns out to be her just singing an old song.  Yeah.  Because it's now not connected to the thing.  And then at the end of it, she's like, fly, fly, fly.  What happened?  Jimmy had a good tweet on that one.  Because that dummy thought everyone was applauding her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, they were applauding the dead people.  You dummy.  Yeah.  Tell me.  She said they're basking in her own terrificness.  Yeah.  They were really applauding for the ones that have gone.  They applaud the dead people on there. 
[01:09:30]  But because that's like liking a Facebook because you're like, I just got cancer.  I found out, you know, they're like fucking applauding dead people.  It was surprising that they did shut that off.  And but the funny thing is about Norton.  Can I say something?  One thing about Norton.  And he's just fucking scared of a microphone that smells a little, but he doesn't mind a  tranny's dick in his mouth.  Well, hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Mars sprayed it.  It's fine now.  All right, Bob. 
[01:10:00]  Bye.  Take it easy, Bob.  Bob, believe me, everyone.  Yeah.  He has some really funny ones.  Nick DiPaolo had one, too.  What did he say?  John Travolta's in his 60s, and his hair is blacker than Whoopi's taint.  Fucking Nick DiPaolo.  That was funny.  We should collect all the funny tweets.  That's probably what we should have done, Sam.  From all our comedy friends. 
[01:10:30]  Do you want to do it?  Maybe someone could do a quick search and get a few of the good tweets together from  the guys we know and love from the radio show.  And of course, we're just being assholes on Twitter with the Oscars.  But then you get like, did you read any of like Jenny Hutz?  Oh, what was she doing?  Oh, she looks terrific.  It's all very up.  Really?  Very nice.  You know, very nice and supportive.  I got one that's even better than Jenny Hutz.  But let's read a few of Jenny Hutz, please, Sam. 
[01:11:00]  This is for Lupita.  Lupita, right.  Shows us she's even more beautiful on the inside.  Oh, yuck.  See, those are just those.  It was just a roll for her.  It was awful.  What an awful tweet.  Jenny Hutz tweets.  What was the other part of it?  The other part of it was her quote.  No matter where you're from, your dreams are valid.  Oh, God.  Boo.  All right.  Boo.  Oh, this is good.  Okay. 
[01:11:30]  Who did hashtag Kate Hudson's makeup?  Hashtag extraordinary.  Oh, yuck.  Oh, yeah.  She's all in, man.  What a kiss ass.  She thinks she's going to be hobnobbing with these people.  Hobnobbing.  She wants to get a gig.  She's looking to get like a pre-Oscar gig.  They were all real nice and supportive.  Give me the Jared Leto.  I see Jared Leto.  It's got to be bad.  Damn.  I love at Jared Leto more than I already did.  His speech, smart, moving, and real. 
[01:12:00]  He makes me feel both maternal and like a teenager.  Let me translate.  I want to hug him and then sit on his dick.  Yuck.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  Watching Laura Dern hold her dad's hands so tightly is freaking awesome.  Until it cracked off.  And she beat him with it and screamed at him because he spent the inheritance.  By the way, Nebraska, our pal is in that. 
[01:12:30]  And he does a great job.  Yeah, I know he is.  The dude from Home Alone.  Yeah, fucking Devin Retreat.  I forgot that he was in that.  He was in my building one night.  Oh, yeah?  He was with some friends.  He goes, did you see the movie I'm in Nebraska?  We were chatting and I saw him.  Was it fun?  Yeah, he was great.  I've seen him on a few commercials and stuff.  He's doing really well.  Coming back out of the woodwork.  He had a big role in that, man.  He was really funny, too.  I haven't seen Nebraska yet.  I haven't gotten my free copy.  Oh, he was excellent.  So maybe someone could burn that for me.  I think it's on demand.  Yeah, I think I paid for it, too.  Oh, it is on demand? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I'll just pay for it.  That's easy.  It really is amazing how quickly movies get on demand now.  That's the pirating, right?  You think that's what it is?  Yeah, I think they realize they could do their theater run, but if they don't go from the  theater to on demand pretty quickly, it's just going to get out there anyway.  And they know, too, with Oscar season, it's like everybody right now, like Opie said,  wants to see Nebraska because people are talking about it.  So get it.  What else?  Anything else from Jenny Hutt?  This one is just like, she thinks the celebrities are going to tweet her back. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  She tweeted Kristen Chenoweth.  Yeah.  Hey, Kristen Chenoweth, you look amazing.  I need the iPhone keyboard.  Who makes it, please?  Ew.  It's like, what?  You think Kristen Chenoweth?  Stop asking questions.  Oh, Jenny.  Oh, Jenny, yuck.  Stop asking questions.  That lady lives in my building, the Chenoweth.  Yeah?  She is tiny.  Who is she?  Oh, you just know her.  She's a big Broadway star, and then she went on to do like a couple things, but she's mainly  known for Broadway.  She got hit in the head on set and messed up her whole career for a while. 
[01:14:00]  Is she older?  She's beautiful, to be honest with you, but she's tiny.  She can't be more than 4'8".  I think I did a level of her.  Her head is tiny, too.  Is this chick?  Yeah.  She is really, really small.  Extremely petite.  Did she get back to Jenny?  She did not.  I checked her replies.  She married.  Oh, that's terrible.  I don't know.  Oh, she's got a guy, I guess.  A boo.  Oh, man.  I need a girl.  That's kind of...  I walked to our supermarket with her once as she was walking her dog. 
[01:14:30]  Wait, now, did you walk with her or just kind of look at her and try to...  Oh, no, no.  Oh, you're chatting with her?  Yeah, because she was walking that way, and it was after her accident.  She had the neck collar on.  The neck brace.  And the paparazzi were outside my building for like a week trying to get that shot, and  of course, part of me was thinking, hey, get me in there.  Because they never got the shot of her all effed up, because she had like a black eye, and  it was bad, man.  Did you make a joke?  Like, hey, what's that?  Why'd the doctors do that?  To keep you from looking at your balls?  No, we just had small chats. 
[01:15:00]  She was very nice, though.  I just asked her legitimately, I'm like, hey, man, how you doing?  Jesus.  And she was like, oh, thanks for asking, and then we just talked a little.  And then, oh, Kim Novak.  Did you see that?  Oh, yes.  What the fuck kind of...  Oh, that plastic surgeon should be shot.  What's up with Kim Novak?  What is this?  I don't know.  Nebraska.  Hey, look at that.  Thank you, Row Rowan.  What do you think of the Oscars, Row Row? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, Rowan's a better entertainment guy.  We should have had him have a full report on the Oscars.  Well, I fell asleep, boys.  Oh, you fell asleep?  How long into it?  I woke up in and out of it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's tired.  How long is my long ago?  That's tired.  Yeah, I just saw Kimmel, which was funny.  Are you a Kimmel guy or a Fallon guy?  Kimmel.  Oh, yeah, you used to work for Kimmel.  Yeah, yeah, you did, of course, yeah.  So, he's funny.  I mean, Rowan can still put together an entertainment report around the Oscars for like 8 o'clock.  That would be good. 
[01:16:00]  Could you do that for us today, Rowan?  A little summation, wrap it up.  Yeah.  Don't touch any of the ground that we touched.  No.  Yeah, I don't want to touch any of the ground.  We'll get some music.  We'll produce the shit out of this.  Rowan, your boy might be suing the other Cronut guy.  Oh, your Cronut guy.  What happened?  You haven't heard the story yet?  Yeah.  Got a guy in Little Italy that's selling Cronuts?  Selling fake Cronuts.  And your boy there is thinking of suing him?  That's not...  I don't know, man.  I don't think I would sue anyone that's in Little Italy.  Oh, forget it.  They're going to find your Cronut guy in a fucking...  Big lawsuit about to go down. 
[01:16:30]  Like Carbone.  Because he went to L.A. to sell Cronuts and he sold out.  Of course he sold out because he brought 20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it a limited engagement?  I love your guy.  I go there every once in a while and he treats me like a superstar.  But the guy's got to make more Cronuts at this point.  Well, people stayed two days in line until you get the Cronuts in L.A.  Two days.  How many did he make?  Do you know?  Only a couple hundred.  Come on.  He goes all the way to L.A. with a couple hundred Cronuts?  No, no.  He made it fresh.  No, I know. 
[01:17:00]  I'm just saying.  Did he bring him on and carry on in his luggage?  They're all mushed against his suitcase.  I want to go in there for a nice dessert and then rub my stomach after and go,  Oh, I shouldn't have.  You see the Cronut lawsuit we have in our prep sheet?  I didn't see it.  I heard it on the news.  I heard it on the news, too, on the way in.  Oh, no.  A guy right around the corner selling Cronuts.  And they're selling them.  They don't look.  Oh, wait.  It's in the papers.  Do they look like Cronuts?  Not really.  No?  Oh, got it.  It's a shitty version of the Cronut.  It's a fugazi Cronut. 
[01:17:30]  It's like Cronuts that crumbs have.  Huh?  Like crumbs have Cronuts.  Oh, look.  Crono, no, they didn't.  What?  That's the headline.  It doesn't even make sense.  Yeah, look.  New Cronut.  Two dollars.  The Canal Street area is notorious for knockoff handbags and watches and now fake Cronuts.  Cronut, Cronut, Cronut.  A bakery is being accused of peddling an unofficial version of the world-famous croissant-donut hybrid created and trademarked by our pal, especially Roland's pal, Dominic Ansel. 
[01:18:00]  Customers say they taste the same and they are only two dollars.  Oh, boy.  A crow to saleswoman hawking the baked goods as Cronuts at City Egg Clare Bakery on Hester Street in Little Italy Sunday morning.  Oh, boy.  Sounds like big trouble in the Cronut industry.  Mm-hmm.  So, Dunkin' Donuts has their rip-off version, too, right?  They all do now. 
[01:18:30]  Dunkin' Donuts?  So, Dominic kind of screwed this one up, don't you think?  Yeah.  He should have made a lot more money.  Crumbs have their crumb nuts, but that just tastes like a piece of ass.  It does.  Enough with crumbs.  I flip them off every time I'm, like, buying crumbs.  You can't be a fan of crumbs.  No.  I hate crumbs.  They're the worst.  They are absolutely the worst.  They used to be good, like the Cake Boss, and then once they franchise it, it's, eh.  What is crumbs?  It's one of these cupcake shops.  It used to be really good.  Sounds good, though.  But they're franchised everywhere.  They're horrible, man. 
[01:19:00]  Magnolia's kicks its ass.  I like Magnolia, too.  Do you like a cupcake, Jim?  Dude, I fucking love a cupcake.  Billy's Bakery is better than Magnolia.  Magnolia, people who used to work at Magnolia, open their own bakery.  Right.  It's delicious.  I'm a fan of the cupcake.  I just think there's better cake out there.  Yeah, but a nice frosting.  A little red velvet.  Do you eat the icing?  Yes, I do.  You've got to eat the icing.  I love it.  Sometimes when I was a boy, and keep this between us, I would just eat the icing and leave the cakey part. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, man.  I swear.  What are you, my kid?  It's crazy.  That's what kids do.  I was a little lad.  It's like, what are you doing?  We're going to have a celebratory cake tomorrow.  It's like eating the top of a muffin.  What did Roland just say?  We're going to have a celebratory cake tomorrow for Eric's birthday.  There's an R in that word.  His birthday was like yesterday.  Yeah, still, we'll celebrate tomorrow for cake.  Looking at his little gifts, it was like just staring into the world of a child.  What, Eric's gifts?  Yeah.  What, you tweeted your gifts over the weekend? 
[01:20:00]  Instagram.  Instagram?  What's your Instagram?  You rock radio?  The little toys.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  He's got a little...  What are those?  Vinyl figures.  It's the complete six-inch set of Doctor Who.  Oh.  Jimmy's just moaning.  I can't think.  If you had to look at what order, where that would come on my list of things I wanted for  my birthday, it would be after the cancer patient's bedpan.  It's just a world we don't know anything about. 
[01:20:30]  No, no.  There's so many people into this.  What are those?  Those are the Simpsons zombie vinyl kid robot toys.  They look like the Simpsons, but they're zombies from the Halloween special.  I'm caught between wanting to burn Eric's house down and being really admiring the way  he has it set up in the basement.  That's really cool the way it is.  You got your shit the way everyone wants their shit.  Oh, he's displaying them nicely.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  What's that? 
[01:21:00]  That's a vinyl Buddha, Homer.  What is that?  How much is that worth?  Not only 50 bucks.  What?  It'll never be worth it.  They're exclusives from Comic-Cons.  Yeah, but you can't collect new stuff anymore, right?  Because everyone collects the new stuff, which means the price will never go up.  Yeah, it's crazy mass-produced.  It's all like, you know...  Right.  You only get it if you want it.  You don't do it for any...  It's not an investment.  It's a collection.  Yeah, it's something I wanted.  It's a hobby.  It's a pleasure.  Yes.  You just look at it and go, ah!  Like a little Homer Buddha. 
[01:21:30]  It's awesome.  What else you get for your birthday?  Oh, zombie Bart.  It glows in the dark.  Did you like it?  I love it.  It glows in the dark.  It glows in the dark.  Six-inch zombie figure.  Okay.  This was, I mean...  Oh, wow.  The number one, right?  It's actually the number two.  Exactly.  I'm going to number two.  I knew that was happening.  That's great.  That's a Lego Simpsons house.  The Simpsons Lego set.  House. 
[01:22:00]  Over 71,000 pieces.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  That big 12-plus age thing is a little distracting.  It's 2,500 pieces, isn't it?  No, that's just the model number.  Oh, sorry.  71,000 pieces would be an insane amount of people.  Yeah, I know.  I was going to say, that's like...  Well, they're small.  Over 71,000 pieces, you thought?  That couldn't be.  You could build your own house.  Yeah, real house.  You don't have that on the shuttle.  I'm all in with Legos, by the way.  I did my first one with my kid.  They're awesome.  I did the Toy Story train thing.  Built three or four train cars, and I was all in. 
[01:22:30]  But I also threw the whole thing out.  Therapeutic.  Yeah, what else are you going to do when it's done?  Well, he played with it to the point, and then it was falling apart, and I couldn't keep  it together anymore.  So I said, all right, this has got to go now.  Down the chute?  Yeah, he didn't notice.  No, but you keep it, because then you build other Lego stuff.  You get a big bin of them, and then you make your own stuff up.  I don't think that's what people do anymore.  No.  Like, there's specialized pieces on some of these things now.  I don't think it's that special.  It's not.  It's kind of fun to put together, but it's not special. 
[01:23:00]  It's like putting together a model, though.  It's not like the old days where you just got Legos.  It's like, make your own fucking thing.  Make something really cool out of it, right.  Now it's like a kit, and there's instructions and where to put everything.  It's like, that's not fucking around with Legos and really using your imagination.  You know what we should do?  We should get, like, uber geeks in here.  Yeah.  We get one of these Lego sets.  We could go with the Simpsons house or whatever, right?  Yeah.  And we give them all a box, but we rip open the bags, mix up all the pieces, and take  the instructions and see who the fuck could actually build it. 
[01:23:30]  Actually build it?  Good luck.  Because, like, that's what I'm saying, but that would be a cool contest.  Do they run contests like that?  No.  No.  It's usually take the blocks and build a new design so they can buy it and then mass produce it.  Right.  They probably run contests like that, but not on radio.  No.  Yeah, good point.  I want to see what these guys could actually do if you throw the instructions away.  Because you're fucked without the instructions. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You'll have to deal with very angry people.  Really?  Some people just go, the money's not worth it.  I'm leaving.  Really?  Yeah.  I bet there's people out there that can figure it out to a point.  Possible.  But it's like, you can't just make something else out of, you know, they've got the Lego  Simpsons house.  And it's all pre-cut.  Yeah, now make something else.  And it's like, no, you can't.  Well, maybe that's cool.  Maybe that's even a better contest.  Not for the radio.  I'll ask Jimmy how to point out and embarrass me with.  But maybe that's the thing. 
[01:24:30]  You take that and then go, all right, make anything but the Simpsons house and see how  creative people can get.  Well, if you wait a few more months, the Ghostbusters set is coming out.  Oh.  With Ecto-1 and the fire tower and everything.  What?  I was reading about it.  They're not building the house.  What?  They're not building the house?  No.  Oh.  What?  That's disappointing.  That's the Ghostbusters car with the characters.  No firehouse?  No.  No firehouse.  No fucking big skyscraper building. 
[01:25:00]  Devil building.  I wish.  I listen.  I also got Billy Joel tickets, so.  Hey.  Oh.  For MSG?  Yeah.  A big boy present, too.  Yeah.  What's your favorite song?  Um.  My Life, maybe?  Ew.  Captain Jack.  Captain Jack.  Get your high tonight.  I like, uh.  I like Moving Out.  I like Piano Man.  Moving Out's good, too.  Yeah.  Right?  You can't argue with, like, the, you know, Piano Man.  I enjoy the man's entire catalog. 
[01:25:30]  I enjoy My Life.  I love how these artists can just sit in one place now.  He's doing.  He has residency at MSG, basically, right?  I think it's once a month.  And then in December, it's 12 sold-out shows.  Jeez.  Once a month.  And then, I think he mixes it up, too, right?  Yeah.  Is he doing the album thing yet?  Like a lot of these artists do?  That I'm not sure.  Where you do the whole album from beginning to end?  Hmm.  Colin Ruin, sorry.  Or, Colin Ruin, with one of his tweets, tell her about it, because I enjoyed that song. 
[01:26:00]  And Colin Ruin, like, listening to, tell her about it, gang.  And then the hashtag was, tell her all your crazy dreams.  Oh, fucking guy.  And I'm like, oh, no.  And I listened to the song again.  And when that line came up, my stomach hurt.  I was like, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Tell her all my dreams.  It's no Asia.  Oh, no.  Supergroup.  Supergroup.  Well, first one.  First thank you, yes.  Yes.  First Supergroup.  Scott Shannon thanks Opie and Anthony on his first show for CBS FM.  Smart man. 
[01:26:30]  There's only one thing that's going to result from this.  We have to get Imus and Scott fighting each other over who we're their boys.  Right.  And Todd.  You know what?  Todd's not a fan.  This is what we could do for Scott Shannon, because we're not in the regular radio world.  And if you did this on regular radio, you'd be fucked.  There are guys out there right now with a fucking people meter.  Yeah.  Just turn it to CBS FM.  Oh, yeah.  Give our new pal Scott Shannon some nice ratings today.  We could say that. 
[01:27:00]  That's true.  If you said that on regular radio, you'd be fucked.  Give them the big ratings and then turn them off.  And then you have to explain the most catastrophic drop-off in radio history.  All right.  We're going to break here.  We've got Scott Shannon Audio thanking us on his first day at CBS FM.  How weird is that, considering the history he has with his radio show?  I was also thinking over the weekend, you have to have him voice Jocktober this year.  Scott?  He has to voice Jocktober.  Oh, my God.  Would that be hilarious?  I'm sure he'll be old about it. 
[01:27:30]  He has to do that.  Well, he said he would come in here.  Yeah.  He emailed me over the weekend.  What did he say?  Thanking him.  Fat Nagel.  Nagel.  Yeah.  Let me read my note again.  That was funny.  That was so funny.  Hey, Benedict Arnold.  Fat Nagel kid.  Sent me an email thanking you guys.  He had a great time.  It was a lot of fun.  He definitely does want to come in.  That's great.  And he's got a voice Jocktober.  That would be great.  Oh, that would be good.  And his wife even emailed.  Oh.  And she said...  Wait, you know his wife? 
[01:28:00]  No.  She emailed the work account, the Opie and Anthony.  Right.  And she said, thank you for inviting him into our family.  Oh, look at that.  Which was nice.  Wait, what?  Thank you for inviting Scott into our family.  Into our family.  Yes.  No, we're all in.  I'm not even joking, man.  We're all in.  He just tweeted you guys, too.  What's his Twitter?  The new one is...  I got tricked by that fake one.  The guy's doing a pretty good job with the fake one. 
[01:28:30]  Scott Shannon CBS.  Scott Shannon CBS.  That's his new show account.  Scott Shannon CBS.  So everyone follow that.  If you have a people meter, just have it on.  Especially during the commercial breaks.  Pick up some CBS.  This is so great.  Just shouted Opie, Anthony, and E-Rock from the ONA show.  Thanks for the support.  That's great.  That's pretty cool, man.  My boys.  There were a couple other things we were going to tease, but whatever.  We got good stuff around the corner. 
[01:29:00]  Try not to curse as much.  All right.  We'll be back.  I failed.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back.  Until then, I'm the captain now.

Ambulance 14 response.  From USA Network and executive producer Dennis Leary comes a new original comedy about three EMTs who are great at their job.  No, you got a dead man here.  Not yet.  I mean, that's why we're here.  But not so great at everything else.  You still live with your parents?  No.  No.  They live upstairs. 
[01:36:30]  I live downstairs.  Whole separate floor.  Sirens, a new original series.  Premieres this Thursday at 10, 9 central on USA Network.  Comedy's welcome.  Opie and Anthony have been creating broadcasting magic for 20 years.  Doug from the O&A vaults.  This is a 20th anniversary O&A radio gem.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is he doing here?  Oh, my God.  Please.  Oh, no.  All right.  I know what the fuck he did. 
[01:37:00]  I know what the fuck he did.  My heart just stopped.  Yes, and it should.  It's very obvious he has no clue, and I'm off the hook.  I just surprised people out of nowhere.  It turns into baby diaper mustache day.  Today happens to be one of those days.  And the odds of it actually happening are slim.  But when we saw your face at the door, I'm like, oh, my fucking God.  Yeah, because he's somebody that would have been listening.  Because you have stopped by with the baby, too, before.  The bottom line is you would take baby shit and put it under here.  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  You'd make a little mustache with baby shit. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, it's green.  Fuck my audition.  Fuck you.  Fuck it.  It's green.  You set me up.  I don't know.  Oh, it's fucking green.  Oh, Bobby's puking.  Bobby's puking.  Get him a pail.  Oh, shit.  Get him a pail.  I don't care.  I'll fucking puke.  I want to see it on his lips. 
[01:38:00]  Fuck all of you.  Bobby can't take it.  What are the odds that I got to set you guys up?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  He's putting on surgical gloves.  Why are you putting on surgical gloves?  So he can handle the diaper.  I want to just fiddle through this myself.  Let's go.  Let's make a nice Yosemite stand.  Holy shit.  I just got my first whip.  Oh, oh.  Dude, disgusting.  You got to bring it.  All right.  Open up the dike.  Let's see what's in there. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bobby, look.  It looks like.  It looks like he ate.  Oh, dog.  Oh, fuck.  It's like dinting more beef stew.  Do it.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is called baby diaper mustache.  Oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, B.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God, no. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, get it off.  He fell on the floor.  He fell on the floor.  He did it.  He took two fingers.  Wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head. 
[01:39:30]  Where is he?  He's going home.  All right.  He's running off to the bathroom.  Holy shit.  Oh, he and Anthony are back.  On with the fart jokes.  On SiriusXM.  Listen, boy, I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away. 
[01:40:00]  You know, I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes that I've made.  She's a real nice girl, and she's always there for you.  But a nice girl will tell you what you should do.  So what should you do?  Oh, listen, boy, I'm sure that you think you've got it all under control.  You don't want somebody telling you the way to stand with someone's soul.  Do you like this one, Jim?  Yes, I do.  You're a big boy now, and you'll never let her go. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  That's just the kind of thing she ought to know.  Ought to know.  Oh, yeah.  Tell her about it.  Yes.  It's just everything you feel.  Give her every reason to accept that you're real.  All right.  What is he saying?  Tell her all your crazy dreams.  Tell her all your crazy dreams. 
[01:41:00]  What if you have a dream that's disgusting?  Yeah.  You want to make a race of dog humans, so you've been having sex with dogs.  That's your crazy dream.  Or literally crazy dreams where you just murder and stuff.  I dreamt that I killed you and Danny, and I chopped you up in a little bit with an axe.  That's so big.  That was a crazy dream. 
[01:41:30]  We got the Scott Shannon giving us a shout-out.  Ah.  Starting his show today.  We're Team Scott here on the OPNS&E show.  On CBRS.  CBRS.  I hate to say I told you so, but if anyone remembers, I did predict.  What did you say?  That he would be a friend of the show.  Really?  Yes.  His show would be better than Todd's.  Wait, you predicted this?  I certainly did.  We were walking down the hallway from the bathroom.  This is Scott Shannon.  He couldn't have been cooler when he called in.  It was unbelievable. 
[01:42:00]  I've never seen a turn like that in all these years.  Yeah.  We've had people come through here after we beat the shit out of them, and they turn the audience.  Yep.  But the way he did it on Friday was just a work of art.  Oh, yeah.  A work of art.  And this is what he just said on his brand-new show this morning.  And I do want to thank somebody.  It's a little bit off the wall, but I got to tell you, I had a good time with Opie and Anthony last week. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, that was one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.  You know, I've always been fans of theirs, and it hasn't always worked out the other way.  No, I haven't heard.  That's what it happened.  So I finally just said, hey, what do I got to lose?  What can they tell?  What can they say?  Right.  They've already said everything nasty and mean.  So we went on, and we had a good time.  And I got to tell you what.  I got a lot of nice email and Facebook hits from some of their people, the O&A militia, from around the country. 
[01:43:00]  Good Lord.  That's a lot of them, right?  I didn't know that many people listened to them.  Jeez, I didn't either.  Over on SiriusXM, but thank you guys.  They really did a great job.  Wait a minute.  Was that a little shot?  Was that a shot right there?  A little bit, right?  All right, that's it.  Is that a little shot?  A bunch of assholes we are.  That's it.  Just sitting on the edge of our seats, just waiting.  I think that woman took a little shot at us. 
[01:43:30]  Who was that woman?  And then a little dirt, a little subtle dirt, E-Rock's telling me on this next clip.  One more clip from Scott Shannon.  I think more people got blown out than just Scott recently.  Oh.  Right.  And he's talking about it a little bit?  A little bit.  I think as time goes on, he's going to start saying more and more.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  He was there for a very long time, and we got the impression that they just kicked him  out the door.  Right.  Yep. 
[01:44:00]  That's what it seemed like.  Possibly right down the stairs.  With his headphones still on.  Rolled it in the chair and was sitting on it like fucking Richard Widmark.  That's the end of that headphone jack clinking on the stairs as he's rolling down.  You traffic-loving old hag.  Get the hell out of here.  He, uh, yeah, I always, I always hate, I told you, I hated how Todd was after a while.  I turned and kind of started liking Scott because I felt bad for him. 
[01:44:30]  Like, you could tell this young jerk-off or younger guy who thought, like, I know which  direction we should go in, and I know what, and you, like, Todd, you're not a funny dude.  No, you're not funny, and, you know, to say you're going to reinvent regular radio, that's  impossible.  It's not interesting.  You're not going to be the guy.  I'm sorry.  Fucking phone scams.  Going to reinvent terrestrial radio and then proceeds to do the exact same things he was  doing.  Right.  Yeah, you have to get rid of all that stuff and start completely fresh and build from  there, but he just loves a good phone scam. 
[01:45:00]  Does he ever?  Just loves it.  Loves it.  How's that hashtag going?  Still going well?  Still active.  Oh, boy.  Because we've got to move on with our radio show, but we don't want the knuckleheads  to move on so as quickly as us.  Oh, yeah.  Hashtag the Todd Show.  Okay.  But Scott Shannon had this to say about his old place of employment.  It is so amazing to walk around a radio station and find people in offices and at their desk 
[01:45:30]  where I just worked.  They pretty much cleared out the whole place.  It's very funny.  You haven't been up there lately, Joe.  No, no, no.  I was banished.  Oh, my God.  Another place.  Oh, yeah.  It had to remind me of that, didn't it?  By the way, Hinkley wrote about that this morning.  Really?  You see that yet?  No, no.  What happened?  What happened is Joe was a bad boy, I guess.  He put the knife in the back of the Scott and Todd show. 
[01:46:00]  Me?  Oh, it's you, huh?  Oh, that's who I hit.  You're the one.  I'm the one.  We hadn't spoken for quite some time, so we had a little chat and worked things out.  Thank God.  Yeah.  He is the number one traffic reporter in North America, so he can get away with a little  whatever you want to call it.  What happened there?  Oh, it's radio.  It's not just PLJ.  They're just assholes.  Yeah.  I would love to say it's just PLJ, but when they're done with you, man, they are done with 
[01:46:30]  you.  Goodbye.  Right.  One of the hashtag the Todd show tweets is that, I mean, they're turning Scott Shannon  into an internet hero now.  Oh.  They have Scott Shannon's face on Danny Trejo's body.  Nice.  It says, Team Scott is greater than Machete.  Nice.  And then the caption says, Chuck Norris, never heard of her.  Oh, wow.  As if to say, Scott Shannon is tougher than Machete and Chuck Norris combined.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Which is really tough.  That's pretty tough.  But Scott sounds very energetic.  I hope he just goes for it.  I mean, he's an older broadcaster.  You have nothing to lose.  You know what's good?  That just sounded like...  Don't hold back.  That sounded like a show that's already been...  That doesn't sound like a first day show.  No.  That's a show that's already been on.  What do you think?  Very natural.  Not like Todd's fucking first show, which...  You thought that sounded first day-ish?  Oh, God.  It's horrible.  Trying way too hard.  Swinging a miss on everything. 
[01:47:30]  Sweepers for everything they talk about.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It makes me physically ill how that guy thinks he's doing great radio.  Yeah.  It's the most...  What's annoying is it's the biggest bunch of hack nonsense.  Yeah.  It's not fun.  And then, Scott, you listen to that.  That was just natural conversation with, like, real people.  Todd's not a young guy.  No.  He's not young.  What do you mean over there, Sammy?  And that's not funny.  That voice is not funny.  Yes, it is.  I do all my prank calls like this. 
[01:48:00]  They're fake.  That's so bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Prank calls.  I call everybody.  I do one an hour.  What is dumb?  One an hour.  This is my voice.  Fuck.  Why do you talk like that?  Jerky voice, voice.  It's just funny.  Did somebody screencap...  Yes, I saw the Wikipedia thing.  Yeah, how funny was that?  I read the whole thing.  It was not good.  Oh, really?  Did somebody change his wiki page?  I don't know.  Maybe he did it.  Wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki.  That might just be the facts.  I think so. 
[01:48:30]  What are the facts?  Well, uh...  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It says...  That's right.  I have them.  Thank you, Ryan.  Should we print it up and highlight it?  No, it's short.  Okay.  Here it is.  Okay.  It says,  Since August 1991, Pentengale has been the co-host of the WPLJ Morning Show with Scott Shannon,  where he is known for his phone scams, in which he rehashes old Jerky Boys routines from the 1990s 
[01:49:00]  and passes them off as his original ideas.  That's good.  That's true.  That's great.  This is Wikipedia, so it's true.  Of course.  After being responsible for booting Shannon from WPLJ,  Pentengale became the sole host of the terribly hack The Todd Show in the Morning on WPLJ. 
[01:49:30]  Do you think it's hacky?  I do.  But there's nothing that I love more than an edited Wikipedia page.  Oh, yeah.  It'll just tickle me every time.  Well, good luck to Scott Shannon.  Yes.  He's off.  Off to a good start.  Off and running.  Off to a good start.  Yeah.  So, what else were we going to do after the break?  Oh, we got Bob, Bob, Brian Green coming in today.  Yes.  Yeah.  He's a physicist.  He's very smart. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah?  Another one of these smart guys, huh?  He's very smart.  Going to come on here and make us sound silly?  I think so.  I think that's going to happen.  What's his big thing?  He's a strength theory guy, right?  Yeah, he's a physicist.  Does he have like a claim to fame physicist thing?  Yeah.  Jimmy was in Pittsburgh over the weekend.  I heard it went great.  And this guy just needs to talk about Pittsburgh.  Oh.  Hold on, man.  Let's say hi to Justin in Pittsburgh.  Justin.  Hello, Justin. 
[01:50:30]  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, Jimmy.  I saw you on Friday.  It was fantastic.  Thank you.  And I'm glad to see that you're going the way of Michael J. Fox because you're a great  performer, but yet you can't control your extremities, apparently.  What do you mean?  Well, let's see.  You just spilled coffee this morning in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  And on Friday, you dropped the mic in the middle of a child most station joke.  Yeah, I did.  It was a mic with a cord, and I was standing on it, and I didn't realize it.  I went to move my arm, and the mic fell out of my hand.  Like a clod. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  I couldn't have done a more rank amateur move.  Did the audience notice?  Boy, it was a dull thud in front of a thousand people.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, Brian Greene is a string theory guy.  So does he do, like, a show?  He's done a bunch of books.  He does TV appearances all the time.  He just did a TED Talk.  TED Talk?  That's right!  No, no, no. 
[01:51:30]  What's TED Talk?  TED String Emporium, for those with theories!  Yeah, he, uh...  All right, that's cool.  What are we going to talk about?  What's his thing?  We're going to talk about, like, uh...  Where's the pet sheet?  Is there something like...  Maybe it is.  Because all these guys got, like, a something.  Like, Michu Kaku.  Greene received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University.  Oh, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho.  In 1984.  And his doctorate from Oxford University? 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  Looks like we got an overachiever.  Yeah, looks like we got a reader.  Where he was a Rhodes Scholar?  A Rhodes Scholar.  Thank you, Tart.  Oh, fuck.  That's just...  What does that mean?  That's just like going to Geneseo and joining a fraternity.  And dropping marshmallows on the rival frat house.  Professor Greene is widely recognized for a number of groundbreaking discoveries in his field of super strength theory.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, he's into super strength theory.  Super strength. 
[01:52:30]  Including the co-discovery of mirror symmetry, which launched a vibrant field of research in physics and mathematics,  and also the discovery of topology change, which showed that, unlike Einstein's general relativity,  in strength theory, the fabric of space can tear apart.  Oh, man.  So more stuff to be scared about when you go to bed at night because of this guy.  I don't think space is ever going to rip.  No.  I think when you go to bed at night, you wake up the next morning, space didn't rip.  Imagine looking up in the sky and there's just a giant tear down the middle of space. 
[01:53:00]  What would be behind the tear?  I know.  See?  Some crazy other space stuff.  A giant foot.  Just something you didn't expect.  A giant space penis.  Look out.  Green is the co-founder and director of Columbia's Institute for Strings.  Wow.  I don't know.  This guy is smart, man.  This is going to be...  I'm not going to understand one thing.  His first book.  Yeah.  The Elegant Universe.  Oh.  Wow, there are fucking people that are just so smart. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, he's the elegant guy?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  His second book, The Fabric of the Cosmo, spent half a year on the New York Times bestseller list.  Does he make it easy, though?  Yeah, he's an entertaining guy.  So, if I pick up one of these books, I might be able to follow along?  I mean, you've got to focus.  Oh, boy.  I'll try.  Good luck with that.  I sure will try.  Maybe keep all reading to the shitter.  And then we've got the dog dude coming in.  Were you disappointed?  Of course.  When's he coming in?  He's 10 o'clock.  Oh. 
[01:54:00]  Cesar Millard.  You don't like...  You don't like the dog guy?  Who's Travis' dog?  I thought you were bringing your dumb dog in.  Oh, thank God he didn't.  You should have brought your cat in today.  Oh, please.  You really fuck him up.  Why?  It just didn't work out.  What didn't work out?  What?  The dog said no?  Yeah, Dexter's busy.  You're not allowed to bring him in?  Well, I think there's rules in the building.  No, there's not.  Nicole brings her dog in all the time.  Yeah, I know, but I wouldn't be bringing mine in personally.  I can't just...  I have a job to do. 
[01:54:30]  Did it suffocate in its sleep?  No.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  He's perfectly fine.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that rotten dog.  Does it have any bad habits?  No.  See?  He's a perfect dog.  Then what are you going to do?  You didn't want Cesar Millard to mess up your dog's brain?  Yeah.  What are we going to do with him?  I have a lot of dog questions.  Talk about dogs.  You ever get bitten?  Go.  Although we said the same thing with Isaac, and that turned out to be a terrific interview.  Even though Colin tried to knock us down.  He did.  He lost that battle.  Yes, he did.  He did. 
[01:55:00]  You weren't here when he called in to try to rip our Isaac interview apart.  The Isaac interview was great.  And, of course, we missed a major thing on Isaac.  Oh, what?  Which, you know, is frustrating.  He was in Wattstacks.  You guys know what that is?  That's a very famous bunch of black performers.  Richard Pryor was in it.  He's making all these pimps laugh.  And Isaac was talking a lot different than Isaac on The Lover.  Oh, was he?  And I got that because I was in Pittsburgh doing radio.  Oh, man.  That guy didn't know.  I never heard of it. 
[01:55:30]  Never heard of it.  He should have sent us a note.  I didn't know it either.  Yeah.  Yeah, Carl tried to fucking...  What could he have possibly said?  Well...  Why did you listen to him?  I called...  No, we didn't.  No.  Oh, when he called up, the first thing he said is, oh, when you were talking to Mandela,  oh, I mean Ted Lange.  We called him out, though, because he didn't hear the interview.  No.  The knuckleheads, our listeners, got a hold of Colin.  And then Colin went back and listened to the interview.  Yeah.  And then he...  I think he tried a little too hard on that one.  Yeah, it was a very good interview. 
[01:56:00]  It was fun.  Got to fight back.  Had a nice hang with Ted Lange.  What do you want us to do when he comes in?  Oh, no.  I didn't expect him to be as good as he was.  No, it was fun.  Hey, back to the Oscars.  So...  Ah.  We read Jenny Hutt's terrific tweets.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we did.  One guy that killed it last night was Donald Trump.  Donald Trump killed it.  Was that really him?  I would read that shit all night.  Was that really him?  Yeah.  The Donald.  He just doesn't care anymore, huh? 
[01:56:30]  He just doesn't care.  He's right.  He wasn't even saying anything.  Could you, like, start from the beginning of his tweets for, yeah, the Oscars?  Yeah.  I think every one is worth reading really fast.  Yeah, he's just like...  Where is it?  He's got a big tournament this weekend.  Mm-mm-mm.  Oh, a little golf?  Well, he's living the life of Riley.  The pros are playing the Cadillac.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  On one of his courses.  All right, here we go.  Go ahead, Sam.  So he's watching the Oscars, I guess. 
[01:57:00]  And this is what starts to get him.  He goes, is this boring or is it just me?  Hashtag Oscars.  Right.  Then he just starts going nuts for the rest of the night.  Yeah.  Just terrible.  That's all he writes.  Just terrible.  Are you writing at what time?  At the beginning of the show.  Which isn't fair, because Ellen had a great set.  She was great.  Yeah, he writes terrible.  Right.  But it's still funny that he's just beating the crap out of it.  And then he writes,  I should host the Oscars just to shake things up.  Oh, boy.  This is not good.  To imagine him hosting.  What's he going to do? 
[01:57:30]  And then he writes,  You're fired.  Yeah.  Certain people are ruining their reputations tonight.  Really sad.  What?  Why did you just say who it is?  Who?  You're a ballsy guy.  Say who it is.  And then he writes,  They must be kidding.  Can this be happening?  Yes.  And then he writes,  Which is worse?  And which is more dishonest?  The Oscars or the Emmys?  What do you mean dishonest?  It's just a goofy awards show.  And then he writes,  What's he talking about?  And then he writes, 
[01:58:00]  Do you believe this singing?  What is he talking about?  This is,  Get it.  This is the exact opposite.  Even you guys,  Who would love to trash it.  Yeah.  Couldn't trash it.  No.  He writes,  Ellen is sadly having a hard time with her lines.  Huh.  Later on she was fumbling a little bit, but.  I don't know how much longer I can take this bullshit.  It's so terrible.  Oh, and then Pink is performing.  Right.  And there's just tweets coming in going, 
[01:58:30]  Oh, Pink killed it.  Right.  Pink is great.  Pink is great.  Right.  Donald Trump.  Judy Garland was much better,  To put it mildly.  He's so angry.  Millionaire mogul.  Right.  Then he starts retweeting,  People saying how great he is.  Right.  Little Andy Lasner,  Who lives his life through Ellen,  And has nothing else going for himself,  Is having a really bad night.  Who's that?  I don't know.  Okay.  I bet that's someone who criticized him on Twitter.  Oh, here's the applause. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, here it goes.  Right.  Here's the applause thing that we were talking about.  They should have allowed applause during the tribute to The Departed.  Really bad production.  And then on another note, he writes,  Bette Midler sucked.  He doesn't fucking mince any words anymore, huh?  No.  He writes,  This cannot be the Academy Awards.  Awful!  A lot of exclamation points on awful.  He writes,  This is amateur night.  Who the hell is in charge of this production? 
[01:59:30]  See, it's just a goofy awards show in the end.  You're not going to see anything special.  He writes,  Ooh, it gets a little political.  Was President Obama in charge of this year's Academy Awards?  They remind me of the Obamacare website.  What?  That's so stupid.  Fucking trying to tie it in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shoot.  And you know how we said,  Oh, how could anybody have anything bad to say about Sidney Poitier?  Sure.  Angelina and Sidney had a really strange vibe going. 
[02:00:00]  What?  What was supposed to happen with that?  First of all, she had to walk him out.  Right.  He's at the end of his life.  It was one of those moments.  They always bring out the old guy to give him a little respect before he passes on.  I think he couldn't see the,  It looked like he was straining to see what he was saying.  Oh, yeah.  I think he couldn't see the teleprompter.  Right.  People get those fucking wet eyes.  Holy shit.  They're always fucking, like, tearing up.  It's rough.  Was he tearing up?  Well, not from emotion.  Oh, just from...  Like, they just get that. 
[02:00:30]  It's rough.  Finally, Trump found something he liked.  Oh, good.  Matthew McConaughey is a good choice.  Also, nice guy.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Then he moves on to whoever he's talking about.  What is he reading?  I think that might be it.  That was about it.  Good for the Donald.  Oh, and then he wakes up this morning.  He's still doing it this morning.  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  He wakes up this morning, and he writes, 
[02:01:00]  Ellen was so awkward and insecure last night.  The pizza skit was terrible.  She should dump Andy Lasner, a guy with no, absolutely no talent.  Who's Andy Lasner?  I don't know.  Is that our manager or...  Our producer or something of the show?  Like, who is it?  Who the hell is Andy Lasner?  Maybe he's a writer.  Executive producer of The Ellen Show.  Oh, okay.  Who Donald Trump, I guess, hates.  But The Ellen Show does very well.  Very well.  It's been on forever. 
[02:01:30]  It's a massive hit.  Huge.  Then he finally ends this morning with,  I have always liked Ellen.  Done her show numerous times.  But she was not good last night.  Fumbling and stumbling.  She had some fumbles and stumbles.  But she's getting good reviews.  Not all good reviews.  No, not from The Donald.  Isn't that kind of how she is, though?  Like, she's kind of awkward.  Yeah, it's that whole quirky thing.  I thought she was really...  I thought she looked very comfortable when she came out to do a monologue.  But I'm not as, you know, obviously qualified to point out somebody doing stand-up as a man like Donald. 
[02:02:00]  The Donald.  The Donald, please.  But I thought she was good.  She wore that wacky Hall of Presidents outfit that she had on, though.  With the...  No, she looked like a patriot.  Looked like the Quaker Oats.  Quaker Oats guy.  She knew the hat.  The hat!  She came out in the Glinda the Good Witch dress.  That was so uncomfortable.  How weird does she look in a dress?  Yeah, yeah.  That's just...  She's a pants man. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  But she figured it out.  Because it doesn't look bad on her for some reason.  The pants?  Yeah.  No, it works.  Well, if you ever saw Mr. Wrong, that movie that she was in with Bill Pullman.  Which, of course, you watch for Bill Pullman.  Bill Pullman seemed to get along.  Yeah.  Like a night of, like, collegiality amongst the stars.  And I would say no surprise winners.  No.  And beginning with Best Picture at the end of the show.  That was a surprise.  Most people expected 12 Years a Slave.  Uh, did win that award.  And, you know, they cleaned up. 
[02:03:00]  And Gravity, I think, won seven awards as well.  So, American Hustle shut out.  Maybe that's a little bit of a surprise.  Yeah, that did surprise me.  Totally shut out.  I thought it might get something.  Yeah, it was tied to the most nominations.  Surprise me, too, guys.  He's got nothing.  I was surprised.  Um, Gravity, uh, American Hustle, as we just said, entered the evening, each with ten nominations.  But it was Gravity taking home the most statues, winning seven of those, including for directing and cinematography.  American Hustle went home empty-handed.  Wow.  Wow.  Christian Bale was amazing in that.  He really was.  It was a good movie.  Mm-hmm.  But he didn't have AIDS. 
[02:03:30]  Did we get Oscars?  I think...  They should have thrown some AIDS in there.  Maybe it was AIDS.  Just sprinkle a few of AIDS in there.  He's a hustler from Long Island.  With AIDS.  With AIDS.  Right.  Just at the end, you know.  Yeah.  By the way, this whole time, I've had AIDS.  AIDS.  Yeah.  Well, they could do an update on the characters, even.  You know?  Like a little screen at the end.  In 1990, he got AIDS.  Yeah.  AIDS.  And that would have helped.  At the end?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Gotta throw that AIDS in there if you want an Oscar. 
[02:04:00]  My God.  I don't like that this, uh, the guy from 12 Years a Slave there hijacked Steve McQueen's name,  either.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  I thought it was something Steve McQueen wrote a long time ago that I was just sitting  around.  I hear Steve McQueen.  I'm like, oh, that guy's cool.  Right.  Great escape.  For a bullet.  Yeah.  And then it's some black guy with an English accent.  Someone's saying that, uh, Donald Trump actually, uh, retweeted Bobo last night.  There's no way that happened.  Oh, God.  Well, there might, because...  Hold on.  Uh, Ryan, there's no way that happened. 
[02:04:30]  It is.  Look at it.  Uh, when he started praising everyone when the show was over, he's like the second tweet  on it, like there's some other person than, than Bobo.  Wait, Sam just found it.  Wait, where is it?  He retweeted Bobo's retweet.  Bobo tweeted, um, goes.  He just started goes to Donald Trump best tweets of the night.  Oscars.  And it's Bobo.  He did retweet Bobo.  But I mean, I'm not surprised.  We're killing it with the followers, man.  Bobo's up to 132,000 followers. 
[02:05:00]  What the fuck?  It's all fake.  I think somebody's spying Bobo a lot of followers.  Bobo's got fake followers.  I think their goal is to have Bobo have more followers than us.  Yeah.  And then that son of a bitch will really believe that.  Oh, he will.  That's a real number.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he'll give his password out to someone.  They'll fuck it up.  He'll have to get a new account.  And then he'll be back to 50 followers.  Sure.  All right.  Oh, we didn't really do much on Kim Novak's face. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, Kim Novak.  I don't know what the fuck that was all about.  Who is Kim Novak?  She's an old actress.  She was beautiful, man.  She was in, uh.  Google image her.  Yeah, yeah.  She was beautiful.  And it's that stupid Hollywood Botox crap where they just start freezing their faces.  That and Goldie Hawn just looked fucking crazy.  The Iron Sheik had a good one there.  Yeah.  The Iron Sheik had good tweets last night.  The Iron Sheik was great last night.  Go fuck yourself.  He was like, he just tells people to go fuck themselves.  Are the guys getting the best Oscar tweets from last night? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Make sure they look at Iron Sheik's as well.  Iron Sheik.  Yeah, he said that, uh.  What did he say about Goldie Hawn?  She looked like Garfield.  Goldie Hawn looked like fucking Garfield.  Looked like fucking Garfield.  And then he wrote Virgil, best actor in 12 Years a Slave.  And then Virgil.  He went on this whole diatribe about how much he wanted to beat up Bette Midler.  The Iron Sheik. 
[02:06:30]  If you don't follow the Iron Sheik on Twitter, you're a fucking idiot.  Is that really him?  No.  No.  It's one of those guys that was in here with him.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's his handler.  With the glasses.  It's probably shit that he says and they just tweet it.  Maybe.  But it's fucking funny.  No, because that guy was tweeting when Iron Sheik was in here.  Yeah.  He kind of let us know.  He's running his Twitter account, but it's hilarious.  Cheeseburger tits.  Yeah.  He's called Bette Midler cheeseburger tits.  He's hilarious.  John Bobbitt, Liza Minnelli, same thing. 
[02:07:00]  John Bobbitt.  He had that shit.  Yeah.  I think there's a new John Bobbitt, though, or something.  Oh, is there?  I think so, yeah.  Not John Wayne Bobbitt.  Oh, okay.  The missing penis guy.  Holy fuck.  That's funny.  Yeah, they'll go through his tweets.  Iron Sheik.  Oh, you wanted to talk about Kim Novak.  Yeah, Kim Novak.  Can we just play part of her?  Yeah, listen to her voice.  She's in vertigo, by the way. 
[02:07:30]  Weird she is.  The original?  Yes.  Oh, God.  And so much fucking, like, yeah, Botox and plastic surgery.  It just frees off the parts of their faces that are aging.  It's so creepy.  Is that what they do?  Yeah, man.  I guess Botox is a good thing if you just use a little of it, but then they just get obsessed with it,  and the next thing you know, they can't smile right with their whole face moving as one.  It's terrible.  It's creepy.  It starts looking like they're wearing a mask.  Yeah.  You know what looked good?  Because she didn't look like she had any surgery or anything done? 
[02:08:00]  Sally Field.  She gets up there.  She just looked like a regular woman.  Well, that's just it.  But she looked, you know, she looked good.  I'm not saying she looked hot or anything for her age, you know.  I guarantee she had some work done.  You think?  Yeah, but she probably, you know.  You can't tell, though.  But you've got to know when to say no, I guess, and stop it.  Before you look like Kim Novak.  Kim Novak.  Yeah, play this.  What's going on?  I'm scary.  Please welcome Kim Novak and Matthew McConaughey. 
[02:08:30]  It's all the fucking over-the-top music.  Is that the Vertigo theme, though?  It's the fucking shows.  It's Vertigo.  Yeah, I know.  But it's like all grandiose.  How are you?  I'm doing well.  Happy to be here.  I think so.  You know, as actors like we are, there's one thing that we actually have zero experience  with, and that's animation.  Why is she out there? 
[02:09:00]  Animation.  You?  They're just there to present the best short.  No, but why is she there?  Just as one of those things, like, hey, remember this lady?  A legend.  Oh, right.  I think they pick people they think are going to die soon.  Yeah, yeah.  Give them their last, you know, hurrah moment on a stage.  By the way, Matthew McConaughey was really comfortable looking and unbelievably good at this  whole Oscar thing, which his speech was, you know.  He went off a little, but.  But it was still.  You know how to point, too.  Like that point he does.  Yeah.  But it's not like the, it's like there's something that he does differently. 
[02:09:30]  He's just a cool guy.  He's a cool dude.  We were on Leno with him.  Oh, yeah.  And now he's an Oscar winner.  Was he as handsome in person?  Fuck yeah!  Right, right.  He's part of the giant head club.  Oh, does he have a big head?  Him and Robert Plant are the biggest heads I've ever seen in person.  All movie stars do, I think.  Giant head.  John Cusack had a giant head.  Giant head.  They all have bigger heads than you think they're going to.  Where is my Matthew McConaughey picture?  Maybe I can fucking find it.  Yeah, he has a giant head. 
[02:10:00]  Put that shit on Instagram.  He's an Oscar winner.  I'm an Oscar winner now.  That's it.  Might be in my S2 file.  Before he was a winner, though.  AIDS.  Hashtag.  Hashtag AIDS.  I'll sprinkle that AIDS in it.  You're not going to win no fucking.  That's the caption.  Met Matthew McConaughey before he got AIDS.  Before AIDS.  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  I got to play the Kim Novak.  Yeah, a little Kim Novak.  Listen where she's out of it.  Not Magic Mike.  No way.  I was a little animated. 
[02:10:30]  You affected a whole generation of men.  That's a hard one.  I've been quite animated with your work in Vertigo.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She's panicking.  Here's something that I really love about animation.  It's whatever they dream of.  And they just draw it.  There's no limits.  She doesn't know what to do.  Total freedom.  Absolutely anything goes.  Yeah, well.  They work with unshackled minds.  I mean, they've got so much freedom.  And it's beautiful. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Pure creativity.  Oh, boy.  And travel writing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Her mouth looks good.  I'll take a minute just to say that I'm really glad to be here.  It's been a long time.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, is that hard to...  Oh, poor Kim.  She just had to stop and break protocol.  Uh-huh.  Thank you for asking me back.  Thank you.  It's been a long time.  I've been very lowly for the last 25 years.  Oh.  Was she nominated in Vertigo or something?  I don't know.  Who knows? 
[02:11:30]  It was a chance.  Sitting there in her house watching Vertigo over and over again in a dark room.  Right.  She gets the phone call.  Hello.  The Oscars, of course.  This isn't because you think I'm going to die, is it?  Yeah.  With Matthew McConaughey.  How do I not have a Matthew McConaughey picture on my phone?  Crazy.  Bro.  I got one.  He had long locks.  Oh, yeah.  He was really handsome.  One of his long-haired roles he was going for.  Wasn't he the guy with the bongos naked, though?  Oh, yeah, he was. 
[02:12:00]  Yep.  Same guy.  Yep.  Beating his chest in Wolf of Wall Street.  She's 81.  Oh, let's see.  She looks good for 81.  Travis just told me her IMDb.  Yeah.  And the last project was 1991.  All right.  That's not that long ago.  That's a long time ago.  What?  Huh?  91.  All right.  That's not that long ago.  37-year career.  54 to 91.  That's a long time.  That's a long time ago.  What?  91 is a long time ago now.  That's not that long ago, right? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, boy.  I was eight.  I was eight.  Now I'm...  Flipping quarters off your ankle?  Now I'm 30.  Fertigo is 58.  1958.  All right.  A little more Kim Novak.  All right.  Everyone's horrified.  Especially Donald Trump.  My main reason to be here at night is to be here with you and to announce the nominees  for the Best Animated Short Film.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  That's good.  We can't.  It's just son of a...  For the Best Short Animated...  Screen.  Wait.  Go back to that part.  That was fun.  Screened Film Animated.  That was kind of fun.  That's a little fun, right?  Yeah.  A little fun for everybody.  The only reason to be here at night is to be here with you and to announce the nominees  for the Best Animated Short Film.  Picture.  Picture.  Picture.  Picture. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, man.  If there was ever a test to see if Matthew McConaughey could maintain that cool in any position...  That was it.  Matt in Jersey.  What do you got, Matt?  Hey, guys.  Hey, you guys.  I don't know if you missed it or not, but Matthew McConaughey has got the Ted Nugent whistle going.  I don't know.  He's got a little whistle, huh?  I didn't catch that at all.  I didn't hear that.  You got to let that go.  He's an Oscar winner now.  My God.  Yeah.  All right.  Check it out, boys.  I'm driving through snow.  All right, buddy.  He's good in True Detective, too.  I think the show is a little overrated, but I do like it. 
[02:14:00]  He's in True Detective?  Him and Woody Harrelson, yeah.  I've got to watch that True Detective.  It's on HBO, yeah.  It airs Sunday nights.  I'm distracted.  I'm trying to find my Matthew McConaughey picture.  I'll show you mine, but there's a lot of cock photos around it.  Oh, no.  Don't freak.  You don't have him in a separate cock picture folder?  I should.  You know, it's funny you say that.  Good point, Ant.  Oh, no.  What happened?  What's Edgar doing? 
[02:14:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Edgar.  It's Edgar.  It's Edgar by Edgar's Heine.  By Edgar's Heine going.  That's a bummer.  I don't know where that picture went.  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  I know.  That's a biggie, I think.  Maybe you have it on your whole laptop.  Yeah, I think I do. 
[02:15:00]  All right, we should take a break.  Poor Kim Milbeck.  We'll kind of take a look at other things that are happening after the break.  Yeah.  This, yeah, the JFK, RFK, Marilyn Monroe sex tape.  Holy crap.  What's on that?  I'm talking about that.  Probably a freedom.  I don't know.  We'll try to figure it out next.  We got that and also the Spike Lee thing.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  We didn't play that.  I think Spike Lee is racist.  Yes.  Horrific.  The guys have a dump on deck.

The trouble leaves our homes in dangerous, unsafe states of disrepair.  Now Adam Carolla and Spike TV have teamed up to hammer home some justice with a new show  on Spike called Catch a Contractor.  In the show, Adam searches out and brings these irresponsible contractors back to face families 
[02:19:00]  they've shafted and finished the job they've started.  Sounds confrontational.  This time, doing it right.  He nails these guys where it hurts using a private investigator on his team to hunt them down and  confront them.  Hidden cameras and all.  The hacks have to work with Adam and his team to finish the project or end up in court.  It's that simple.  Damn, you may be asking yourself, why is Adam Carolla involved in this kind of show?  Before his comedy career, Adam spent 10 years working construction and is actually a master carpenter.

It was fucking great how he just beat everybody up.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage.  Don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big dad! 
[02:25:30]  Stepdad!  Have pony!  And then at the end, he brings the fucking big singer.  I saved her life.  It was fucking horrendous.  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good, yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up on the next At the Movies with Norton and Voss.  The Opian Anthony Show is back.  Tighten your sphincter.  Oh, boy. 
[02:26:00]  The Who.  The Who.  They're coming back.  I guess they're recording an album?  Yep.  That's crazy.  What are they going to do?  Who does all the writing for that band?  Pete Townsend?  Exactly.  I believe it's Pete.  Huh?  Yeah?  Yeah, he said Pete's got like 100 songs.  Yeah, that's what I was about to say.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  Yeah, he wrote 80 to 100 songs.  So they're ready to record again.  Who? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yes.  Ah, seriously.  No, not yes.  What?  Oh, yes.  Asia.  For a super group, Asia?  Wait.  Nice.  I was watching one of the last concerts with Keith Moon playing.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  I was watching one of that.  They had that on, what is that, Palladium?  The channel, Palladium?  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  It's his actual last show?  It was like one of those few, it was that tour, that last tour with Keith Moon.  77, something like that.  It's pretty cool.  Travis, we've got to play U2 in a break from last night.  Really?  Oh, U2.  You don't like U2, do you?  I'm not a huge fan of U2.  I like some songs.  They sounded great last night, no?  I didn't think they did it at all.  He sounded good, his voice.  You don't like it, Travis?  No, I don't like the acoustic version of that song.  I really like the original song.  I think it's a catchy song.  I'm not a fan of the song, really. 
[02:27:30]  But I don't know why they played acoustically.  I guess it would have been a big pain in the ass.  Yeah, just because they didn't want people to be excited and they didn't want to get the  energy up too much.  Boy, does that crowd love U2.  Oh, man.  Bono, biggest dick in the room.  Like a rock star.  Oh, he's got a big one?  No, no, no, no.  But I mean, like, he, he, no, but I'm saying it like that, like, all those celebrities.  Yeah, and they just all look at him like, oh.  They all were excited to see Bono walk by on the red carpet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what's, I mean, the edge, that's got to just, what is he doing? 
[02:28:00]  What do you mean?  Why wear the cap?  Because he doesn't have any hair.  All the time.  That's just his thing, right?  But it's, he's sitting in the audience at the Oscars.  I hate when it becomes the person's thing, though.  The thing.  It was all right.  You're kind of right.  Because I was thinking this, I was thinking about this over the weekend.  Because Tiger Woods, his thing is to wear red every Sunday.  Red on Sunday.  It's like, now it's uncomfortable to see.  It is.  Because it has now become his thing.  It's his thing.  It was just something he did for a while. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  And now it's forced, and it's his thing.  Yeah.  And you're right.  The edge, same thing.  That, that, that look looked all right for a while, but now it's his thing.  It's like, oh, if he took it off, everyone would be like, where's your cap?  Right.  Where's your wool cap?  Who else has a thing?  Bono.  Bono with what?  With the glasses.  Tinted glasses.  That's his thing now.  There's not a lot of people that do that, though.  So they kind of stand out.  I'm trying to think of others.  And then, well, last night with the dumb hat. 
[02:29:00]  What about Steven Tyler and the scarves around his microphone?  Yeah.  What?  You might get cold up there.  You never know.  Those are terrible.  Just becomes your thing.  Oh, the worst.  My thing, guys.  Huh?  I don't like a good thing.  Yeah, raisins get caught in your teeth.  Oh, God.  They pick one out a couple days from now and it's rotting.  Oh, my God.  Even though you floss every day? 
[02:29:30]  What?  It only happens to me?  I think so.  Well, things happen to everybody.  It's just, you know, most people don't bring them up.  No smoothie today.  First time I've used my teeth in three weeks.  Who else has a thing?  I'm thinking who has a thing.  Where it gets uncomfortable.  It's like cool at first.  Like, oh, that's kind of cool or different.  Different maybe, I guess.  Oh, Heather Mills making flower planters out of a rice shoe. 
[02:30:00]  That's her thing.  That's her thing.  That's her thing.  A little joke.  So there might be a sex tape out there.  This is unbelievable.  I actually want...  How do we try to get this?  We've got to bid on it, yeah.  I'll do it.  They're expecting a couple hundred grand, but it's got to be worth more than that if it's legit.  Now, who the fuck?  I'll throw 200 at it.  Who took this?  How do we throw 200 at it?  I'll throw 250 at it.  For real.  Get the word out.  Quarter mil. 
[02:30:30]  I'll go quarter mil.  You know how much money you can make off that if you get it for a quarter mil?  Well, 300,000.  Like, who took it?  What is it?  And I'll control it, too, man.  I'll get like a little, like, maybe like a peep booth.  I'll have everyone line up.  $10 a shot.  Well, it'll take a while, though, to make the money back.  That's all right.  I'll get it, though.  It's supposed to be a threesome between Marilyn Monroe, RFK, and JFK.  And people back then just could keep a secret.  First of all, why did they do this? 
[02:31:00]  I'm kidding.  I guess because you just would be a real scumbag if you were the person that told the world about it.  Why would they do this, and why would they film it?  That's my thing.  Yeah, I don't think it's real.  Like, I don't think it's real.  Maybe they did have a threesome.  Who the fuck knows?  But that would have to be so on the QT.  With your brother?  No.  That's the weird part about this whole thing, I think.  Yeah.  Me and my brother made out with chicks in the same car once while listening to Dr. Ruth Westheimer.  Wow.  You know, nothing but the best entertainment for us when we were in high school. 
[02:31:30]  We had a couple of girls, and we decided that we needed to listen to Dr. Ruth Westheimer to get them all ready.  Get them all juiced up.  Get them all ready for our tongues.  Oh, God.  Why were we listening to Dr. Ruth Westheimer?  I don't know.  What was the option?  I don't know.  Fucking Mars Invasion by Orson Welles?  I remember like it was yesterday.  Yeah, he was in the front.  I was in the back. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, in the ass.  Dr. Ruth was on the radio.  We got a few road sodas.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Some night out on Long Island.  Sounds horrible, right?  Yeah.  But I can't imagine doing a threesome with your brother.  Like, what the fuck?  And the closest we got, I told that story about the two babysitters that were downstairs.  Yeah.  And the one threw up all over my brother and stuff, so I got the other one.  But that wasn't, you know, there was no together thing going on. 
[02:32:30]  There is that JFK story that Mimi Beardsley told about in the White House pool when Dave said,  when he said something like, why don't you take care of, JFK said, take care of my friend Dave.  And she blew Dave Powers in the pool while JFK sat there and watched.  And he tried to get her to fuck or blow Edward Kennedy, but she wouldn't do it.  And she was mad that he asked her.  And he apologized.  Look really fast.  Oh, yeah.  This guy gets pulled.  The snow plow. 
[02:33:00]  It's a viral video today.  Wow.  Braving the Elements.  He gets just destroyed by a wall of snow from a plow.  That's a good one.  Go check that out.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page or we'll tweet it out.  Our Twitter account is O and A show.  Yeah.  I never understood the threesome with, like, another dude involved.  I don't get that either.  No fucking way, man.  I don't mind that if I don't know the person.  It just seems too...  Too...  Gay.  I was going to say weird, but it just seems gayish or something. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  But we bring this up from time to time on our show.  And the guys will call, like, no, not at all.  Me and my friend high-fiving.  I just...  I don't get it.  No.  See, I can't do it with a friend.  I've paid couples to watch them fuck before.  That's hot.  Paid couples.  That's so hot.  What do you do?  Just sit in the corner?  Jerk off like an animal.  No, you're not in the corner.  You're right there.  You just jerk off like an animal.  Do you give them directions?  You can, but it's hot to watch it.  It's really intimate and weird to watch two people fuck on the bed that close. 
[02:34:00]  It's very, very strange.  Are you on the bed?  Yeah, just jerking off.  Are you allowed to touch?  You can, but a lot of times they don't really like...  You know, the chick is a little skittish if it's a real couple.  I couldn't do that.  It's hilarious.  I just couldn't do that.  I swear I'm not judging you.  I just couldn't do that.  Can I tell you what's hot, though?  Yeah, go ahead.  The intimate part of it is if you're watching two people fuck and the girl makes eye contact 
[02:34:30]  with you, there's an odd intimacy about that.  There's a really, it's really, and it's all part of the perverted thing.  It doesn't mean anything.  Sure.  It's not real.  Right.  But that, to me, is the hot part about it.  It's the girl looking at you somehow and acknowledging that she's thinking of you at that moment, even  though she's just fucking her.  It's really weird.  So when was the last time you did that?  It's been a while.  I mean, it's been a long time.  I think it was in San Francisco.  After one of your shows or something?  And then you go back to their hotel or their house?  No, no.  There's always people off, like, a fucking Craigslist or whatever. 
[02:35:00]  It's never people I know.  Oh, so they do this a lot, I guess.  Yeah, I've had a couple with people, like, with fans.  So they don't really know you?  No.  No, I'm just watching, like, a porno movie.  I've had a couple with fans, but the last time I did that, it was, like, a couple times with  the same couple.  I think we were off the air.  I'd be like, that's how long ago that was.  And the girl convinced me to shave my pubes.  Because they were all straight and Asian looking.  And she's like, you ought to shave them.  And then from then on, I shaved my pubic hair.  Straight and Asian looking, huh?  But I was hitting on this girl after a gig. 
[02:35:30]  And she was leading me on, like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was getting real vibes off her.  And she said, well, I'm in the hotel with my boyfriend.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I kept trying to get her back to my room.  And she convinced me, like, well, you can watch us.  And I was like, I guess that was my only option.  And I watched.  But then she fucking sat on my dick and rode my dick.  No bag, no nothing.  And he just watched because he was drunk.  Oh, my God.  And he was all right with that?  Yeah, he was cool with it.  It was hot.  What the fuck is going on?  So weird. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  That is so odd.  It was really fun.  Well, there might be a sex tape out there.  JFK, Robert Kennedy, and Marilyn Monroe.  And it's going to hit the auction block.  I would absolutely bid on this.  If it's real.  There was a Marilyn Monroe one that got no bids because experts said it was not her in the video.  President JFK and his brother Bobby are facing an X-rated missile crisis.  Ah, I get it.  It's a decade old, a decades old film claiming to show a menage a trois with Marilyn Monroe 
[02:36:30]  and the Kennedys goes up for auction Tuesday tomorrow.  It's going to be a zoo, predicted attorney Ryan Sullivan, whose clients are looking to collect $200,000.  They'll get more than that, right?  If it's legit.  I bet it's going to be something you can't see any faces.  Yeah, of course.  It's like fleeting glimpses of things.  In a mirror, you'll hear like, ah!  Ah!  Look out, Bobby, I'm coming!  It's an 8mm, more than a half-century old. 
[02:37:00]  No sound.  Landed in Castlebury's hands during the 80s, a friend of the collector said.  Castlebury, a huge baseball fan and collector of baseball memorabilia, never made the steamy  footage public out of respect for Yankees legend and Monroe ex-hubby Joe DiMaggio.  Oh, come on.  That's shit.  This guy did screen the film to verify its contents, the friend said.  So they're confident that this is real.  That's crazy.  How is that a secret for 50 years?  Yeah, exactly.  That threesome.  Why would he allow that? 
[02:37:30]  Exactly.  Unless it was done behind a one-way mirror or something.  Yeah, but...  Unless it was done surreptitiously.  You know how hard it is to set up equipment back then?  It's the president.  Wow, they had a GoPro.  Oh, fuck.  Fucking president.  He's not going to let that be filmed.  Don't you think if it was real, the Kennedy family would just pay as much money?  Yeah, how about that?  Yeah, the Kennedy family buys it.  That's right.  Good point.  Maybe they will.  Maybe they got a few bucks. 
[02:38:00]  Or maybe they tried.  Or maybe they said, oh, okay.  Yeah.  No one's going to believe it.  Yeah, this is horse shit.  Yeah, there's something about this that doesn't seem right.  Doesn't add up.  Maybe they tried to sell it to the Kennedys and they said no.  So now he's going, okay, I'll auction it.  And somebody private, a collector, a private collector.  I bet you will never see the light of day.  No.  Never.  We got a guy saying it's a fraud.  Jack in Boston.  Jack.  Oh, no.  Jack.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Jackie.  Hey.  So I heard that the guy who was selling it, oh, it was like $200,000 in fraud. 
[02:38:30]  And he's only selling it for a minimum of $200,000, but he won't let people see it before  he even sells it.  So it could be anything.  Wait, wait, wait.  So if you bid on it, you can't even see it beforehand?  Yeah.  No, he won't.  Then it's a fraud.  Because if you know you have it, you would absolutely show people because the bids would  go way higher.  Yeah.  And the guy who was auctioning it off owes $200,000 for fraud.  Oh, really? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  He's just trying to pay some bills.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Fake.  Fake.  Totally fake.  Let's say hi to Brian in Canada.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  I just got up.  I didn't tune in.  You guys talk about the ostrich yet?  Like the racist aspect of it?  The reverse racism?  Why was it racist?  This show, this movie, 12 Years a Slave, you couldn't say anything bad about it. 
[02:39:30]  You couldn't, you couldn't, it was like a, a flippin' steamroller.  And then Ellen DeGeneres makes that comment.  She goes, well, there's two possibilities.  12 Years a Slave wins Best Picture, or possibility number two, you're all racist.  That was a funny line.  Yeah, but that, it goes to what you guys have been saying for years.  I used to think it, and then you guys are so logical about it, that the media just steamrollers  this.  Maybe it wasn't a great film.  Jimmy thought it was a great film.  I thought it deserved, and it had great performances, right, Jimmy? 
[02:40:00]  I did not see the movie, so I'm out, but.  I thought she deserved Best Supporting Actress.  I wouldn't have minded seeing the lead get Best Actor, but I thought it definitely deserved  Best Picture, and I was surprised they did it.  I really thought that they were going to, see, people think, well, political correctness,  but the way Hollywood deals with PC shit, it's usually in a supporting actor role.  Like, okay, give the black guy this or that, but they gave it Best Picture, which I  was shocked at.  I don't think there was a standout film this year as far as Best Picture goes. 
[02:40:30]  Usually there is.  Usually it's pretty obvious what movie's going to win it.  It's not like they gave it to Soul Plane.  Right.  Fucking, you know, it was a legitimate movie.  Yeah, I thought it was the best movie of the year.  All I can think of is you guys when I read this this morning and saw that, and I know you  know, I might be wrong.  I didn't see the movie either, so I'm not saying it wasn't.  Then you have no leg to stand on.  No, I only picked on it because of listening to you guys for some years, and I know you 
[02:41:00]  guys always aren't on the other side as well.  You can be very imbalanced.  That's what I love about listening to you guys, even though your opinions are diverse.  You guys can be very fair.  The only thing I thought was weird, if you want to go down the racist road, was where  they kind of put the black and white couples together over and over again on the stage.  That seemed a bit forced to me.  I didn't even notice that.  But it didn't, but I wasn't bothered by it.  I just thought to myself, wow, here's Hollywood trying a little too hard for a little diversity  tonight.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Make it look like that.  Besides that, whatever.  Yeah, I guess I maybe overreacted, but I could just see Anthony sitting there, you know,  shooting that.  Everybody expected me to, you know, what the fuck is it?  It's a movie.  It's a legit movie.  I just had a problem with the perfect teeth.  Every scene I've seen from that movie, the slaves, they're 12 years a slave, and they got  beautiful teeth.  They should have borrowed the boat guy's teeth.  Oh, he's on the front page of our paper today in Hamilton, near Niagara Falls.  He's the first picture with the receding hairline. 
[02:42:00]  Doesn't he look like he's seen a ghost?  Like, he's looking around going, I've never seen this much food in my life.  Oh, man, your phone cut out.  Your phone stinks, dude.  Sorry, but I just, they got him on the front page, the Ethiopian guy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Brian, you still there?  Yes, sir.  Say it again, but slow.  Your phone's trapping out.  Something about your front page of the paper there.  They've got the Somali guy.  Okay.  Oh, from Captain Phelps, right.  We had him in studio.  Really nice guy. 
[02:42:30]  He looks so, but the picture they've got of him, he's looking around like I've got so much  food.  Brian!  Is he still there?  Are you on a cell?  I hear him saying, you're saying something about an Ethiopian guy and food, but you're not  clarifying your thought, or you are, but your phone is dropping out.  I, I'm...  Where are you calling from?  Where are you calling from?  Where are you having weird phone issues?  I'm going to graciously bow out.  Touché.  Thank you.  What'd you say?  No, no, no.  Brian.  Brian.  Sorry, I'm still here.  Oh, okay. 
[02:43:00]  We can hear you now.  Now we can hear you.  Okay.  You said something about the Somali guy and you're just dropping out.  Please just slow down because I think you're talking and your phone is dropping out.  Okay, Jimmy, Jimmy, right.  Thank you.  I'll slow it down.  Yes, yes.  Sorry about that.  I don't want to...  No problem.  Five page of the page.  Go ahead.  Looking like he's never seen...  We heard you!  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Don't say, no, you didn't. 
[02:43:30]  No one would fall.  Oh, my God.  Gladly fall for that.  You didn't know.  No, you don't graciously bow out and then be like, by the way, I'm still here.  I'm still here.  Oh, my God.  I love when they fall for that.  Well, Spike Lee.  Oh, right.  Now you want to talk a little racism.  He doesn't like the hipster.  No.  Spike Lee hates the hipster.  Doesn't like it. 
[02:44:00]  He was doing one of his speaking engagements in Fort Lee, where he's from, in Brooklyn.  Fort Greene.  Fort Greene.  Oh, Fort Greene.  Fort Lee, did I say?  Jesus Christ, sorry.  Fort Greene, yes.  And he's not a big fan of the white people moving in.  Nope.  Yeah, because it's gentrification.  Oh, God.  Enough already.  Imagine being a public figure and saying you're not a big fan of black people moving in.  Yeah, we're going to be the co-host of this show. 
[02:44:30]  So we've got a couple clips of Mr. Spike Lee.  You mentioned gentrification with some slightly negative connotations, and I wondered if you've  ever looked at it from the other side, which is that if your family was still in that $40,000  home, it's now worth three and a half or $4 million.  All right.  Let me just kill you right now.  Okay.  Go for it. 
[02:45:00]  Because there was a bullshit article in the New York Times saying the good of gentrification.  I don't believe that.  Here's the thing.  I grew up here in Fort Greene.  It's changed.  And why does it take the influx of white New Yorkers in the South Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed-Stuy,  in Crown Heights for the facility to get better?  The garbage wasn't picked up every month of the day. 
[02:45:30]  When I was at 165 in Washington Park, P.S. 20 was not good.  P.S. 11, Wolf Show, 294.  So why, why, why, the police went around.  When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, 3 o'clock in the morning, the  125th Street, that doesn't tell you something.  Yeah, the neighborhood's getting better.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Why, why is that?  When the neighborhood gets better, you get better services.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  When more money gets pumped into the area because there's working people.  Right.  And the property values go up because they've taken care of the buildings and the area around it,  of course it's going to get better.  The services get better.  That's just basic economics.  Yeah.  I was driving through Kensington this weekend.  You don't know Kensington.  It's in Philly. 
[02:46:30]  It is, it is a scary, scary war zone.  Yeah.  But it's all white.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  They're not getting their garbage picked up.  What's the problem?  Drugs.  Oh yeah.  A lot of drugs.  Drugs.  A lot of, uh, a lot of that crack.  And it's white people?  Yeah.  It's extremely white neighborhood and it's very bad and it's, it's, it's, it's, you know,  they're not getting their garbage picked up because, you know, it's not because they're  black.  They would rather like, you know, use their resources toward other neighborhoods. 
[02:47:00]  It's just how it is.  What would Spike Lee like?  That no white people move in and it's just a war zone and a horrible crime ridden area  forever?  Or, or, you know, what he, what his, what he would probably like is that the police, he  sees that it's a safer neighborhood.  He heard it's a police presence.  He would probably like to have seen the services there.  What he's saying is it wasn't like that when he was growing up.  The police weren't as good.  I mean, that's just what he's saying.  Well, when the police show up and no one fucking talks to them and, uh, they protect and, uh, 
[02:47:30]  uh, the sympathies lie with the drug dealers and killers, what the fuck would you expect?  He's an idiot.  Yeah, but there's a lot of phonies out there because, you know, there's a lot of people  that don't want blacks moving into their neighborhood, but now that Spike says it, you know, in the  reverse way that people are like outraged, call him a racist.  Well, but he's allowed to say that.  True.  You can't fucking, you can't go, hey, I sure don't want blacks moving into my neighborhood. 
[02:48:00]  You get a white director saying the same stuff.  Right, right.  Oh boy, you're right about that point.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Although the industry, they've never been good to Spike anyway.  Like, you know, the Oscars are never going to give him anything.  Because his movies aren't Oscar worthy.  You don't like his little floating guys walking, but they look like they're floating.  He makes good films, but he's gotten some good performances.  I liked that Jungle Fever.  Awesome.  Frank Vincent was great.  But yeah, he got Samuel Jackson's best performance ever was in Jungle Fever. 
[02:48:30]  Oh yeah, that's a good one.  He's gotten some great shit out of people.  Yeah.  Have any of his movies made any type of Oscars for best performances or anything like that?  I don't know if X was nominated, but the fact that Denzel Washington didn't win for  Malcolm X was really fucking annoyed me a lot.  Yeah, he thought he should have gotten that.  Without a doubt.  Let's say hi to, oh boy, here we go.  Boston checking in.  South Boston.  Oh no.  Uh oh.  Mikey.  Yo.  What's up, Mike?  I just wanted to touch on, you know, in South Boston, it was white people in trash forever. 
[02:49:00]  And now there's new real deal over there, everyone's pumping money in there, and there's  new workers, and it's really, really nice now.  There's not a bad part in that area.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Happens all the time in neighborhoods.  Isn't that a good thing?  And if you can figure out which neighborhood's going to turn, you can make a lot of money  flipping houses and whatnot.  Yeah.  Or throwing a business in there.  Yeah.  It was all white people.  Right.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  Thank you.  Let's continue with Spike Lee.  And I know this keeps...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa. 
[02:49:30]  And even more.  Let me tell you some more.  I'm coming back.  Can I talk about that?  No, not yet.  Not yet.  And then comes the motherfucking Christopher Columbus Syndrome.  You can't discover this.  We've been here.  You just can't come in both sides.  How was that?  There was a drum that was still a motherfucking action drum in Mount Forest Park for 40 years. 
[02:50:00]  Now they can't do it anymore because the new inhibitors said the drums are loud.  My father, the great talent musician, that literally bought a 19-month club in 68 and a month  of other people who moved in next year and called the cops to my father.  He's not even playing electric bass.  It's acoustic.  All right.  So his father's been there forever.  And then you got somebody that's brand new.  Call them the cops on him as he's trying to play. 
[02:50:30]  Play his music.  Quality of life loss.  In place.  You know.  Do what you got to do.  You just can't come to the neighborhood and start Bogart and say,  like your motherfucking Columbus and get killed off the Native Americans.  There's a culture.  There's people.  You just can't move and start.  Here's another thing.  When Michael Jackson died, they wanted to have a party for a motherfucking 4-3 party.  And all of a sudden, the white people 4-3 said, wait a minute.  We can have black people have a party for Michael Jackson to celebrate his life. 
[02:51:00]  Who's coming to the neighborhood?  They don't even have a garbage.  Garbage.  Have you seen Baldwin Park in a war just like the motherfucking West to West Mr. Dogs show?  This is where you've got the dogs running around.  He don't like dogs?  No.  It doesn't matter.  No?  What's wrong with fucking...  He's protecting his culture.  What culture, though?  If he's saying that it's...  Black people's culture. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  They got a way of doing things and a way of life.  Well, that's great.  So you'd rather have...  It's being bogarted.  The shitty fucking neighborhoods riddled with crime, disease, and fucking garbage.  Is Fort Greene that bad?  Was it really that bad?  I don't know.  I don't even know.  It wasn't a great area.  Hipsters are fucking amazing the way they move.  They are out of their minds.  Well, yeah.  I mean, but half the reason you go there is because the rent's cheap and you're being pushed  out of every other neighborhood.  Well, how...  And this is the question, too. 
[02:52:00]  What is it about white people moving in that makes the property values go up?  Like, you have to ask Spike that, too.  Like, in his argument, will the police come around more so the neighborhood becomes safer?  They don't want them to get...  But what is it...  Why is it when white people move in?  Like, if those hipsters just moved in, who gives a fuck?  Why does anybody even notice?  Why is it even a property value issue?  If they demand more things, over time, you'll notice they'll demand better schools.  They'll pay higher taxes so that you can get better teachers and better schools, better 
[02:52:30]  police, better utilities.  Like, everything just gets better.  Again, it's like one of those Sims games, you know?  It's amazing how realistic those things are when you look at the big picture.  You pump money into an area and make the situation better as far as utilities go, schools,  houses, uh, jobs.  You're gonna fucking...  The whole area's gonna get better.  Yeah, I guess he doesn't want that.  So, not if they're white.  You know.  Where are all the successful black people pouring into these neighborhoods then? 
[02:53:00]  How about you get all these fucking guys we saw on the Oscars last night, all these  black celebrities and all these black businessmen and all these great black fucking leaders  that are making a lot of money and have them go into these areas and live there amongst  the fucking criminals for a little while until it turns?  How about you do that?  And why did Spike leave?  Didn't he have like a...  Right.  He saw he bought a place...  He said he was being bothered too much because someone did bring that up. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he sold it for more than it was that he paid for.  Oh, I'm sure he did.  And he moved to the Upper East Side.  Yeah, exactly.  Why are you doing that?  Why don't you stay in that neighborhood and spend the money there?  Lead by example.  Oh, wow.  Of course, being bothered too much.  That's what he said because he kind of came on.  He's a hypocrite.  So he can do something that he doesn't want to be bothered, but if people call the cops  because they're feeling bothered, it's a cultural disrespect.  Got it.  Okay.  Wow, that Irina Sheck.  What's her name?  The model?  She's fucking sex-sheck. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, she's...  She's a delight.  She's sex-sheck.  Oh, Jesus.  Kiss a few girls on the way to the stage and gets the heart pumping.  Is there really girls that still want to kiss Steven Tyler?  I'm not fucking...  Oh, my God.  He is downright scary looking now.  Larry David.  What was this with the Larry David?  I don't know.  More of that just drivel that they interview him.  He was a comedian, John.  I forgot that Patton was tweeting about doing gigs with him, the guy who wrote the screenplay 
[02:54:30]  for 12 Years a Slave.  Really?  Speech of this evening.  Thank you.  Was it rehearsed?  Did you prepare it?  I prepared some words.  But when you get up there, really, you have to speak from the heart.  I was there, and I had a chance.  Jared Leto's going to get old really fast.  You think he's got that?  That's called the Tom Skerritt.  No, I don't mean it that way.  I mean, he's going to wear on people quickly.  Oh, you think?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  He's a little wacky.  He's in that Macklemore category. 
[02:55:00]  Is he?  A little bit.  I disagree, because he rarely does movies.  He hadn't done movies in years.  Seven years or something like that, right?  He just goes back and does his stupid band.  But do you think he's going to do a bunch now that he's an Oscar winner?  No, just something about him that's going to just wear thin with people, I think.  They love him right now.  They're going to turn on him.  You'll see.  Before this season, this Oscar season, he was kind of a joke.  I mean, people have always been fairly annoyed.  He was always respected, though, as an actor, though.  Really?  Yes, absolutely.  He was always known as a really good actor. 
[02:55:30]  He's Jordan Catalano.  Oh, right.  He played John Hinckley, too.  Yeah.  He gained a...  Look up to John Hinckley.  It's amazing it's the same guy.  Doesn't look like him.  I know these guys, like, you know, gain weight and lose weight for roles and stuff.  But what he did for that...  It was a weird independent film.  It didn't do well at all.  But there you go.  Go down.  Go down.  One over.  That's him.  That's Jared Leto.  That's John Hinckley.  And he did something right before that, too.  That was also...  Isn't that wild? 
[02:56:00]  Let's say hi to John in Rockland.  John.  Oh, wait.  He was in Requiem for a Dream.  He was amazing.  Yeah, that's right.  Very good.  Yeah.  John wants to talk about Spike Lee.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know, I can't believe that you guys sparked me to call in over the Spike Lee thing.  But, you know, as a guy that grew up in Bensonhurst on the Gravesend side in Brooklyn, you  know, I can remember growing up and always hearing the protests from the African-American community  about how, you know, the neighborhoods that African-Americans always thought you're not 
[02:56:30]  allowed to go into Bensonhurst so you get attacked.  And I always thought that was a little silly.  But when you grow up in that surrounding, you sort of drink that Kool-Aid.  That's what you know.  And I remember black communities complaining about their own school district.  And they would want to bus kids into the Bensonhurst Gravesend schools.  And they did.  And there was nothing wrong with that.  We got along with them fine.  And then I wound up going to school in Coney Island.  And I was the only white Italian kid in Coney Island. 
[02:57:00]  You know, I went to a music school at the time.  And that was fine.  And everything's hunky-dory.  Sometimes I think maybe Spike Lee's just trying to sell his brand.  I can't even imagine that he believes his own shtick.  And I'll tell you, we still have that house.  And when we're emotionally ready to part with it, or at least my parents are, and my aunts  and uncles, that's going to go to the highest bidder.  And right now...  I don't know where he stands.  I think Spike Lee's full of shit as well.  Oh, okay. 
[02:57:30]  I don't even think he believes what he's saying, to be honest.  I think his shtick...  And I like Spike Lee.  I actually like his movies.  Everybody in my neighborhood always hated it because he would attack the giant people  over Bensonhurst.  Unfortunately, he's kind of right.  You know, I grew up there.  I know he's on the mark.  I find it funny.  I don't take it to heart.  I don't take it as real life.  But I don't know.  I think he found a form, and he was doing his own stand-up routine.  I really don't take him seriously when he talks about the plus green and why I wife. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Your phone's starting to break up, or we would continue.  I want to go to Paul in Chicago.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I love you, but I sort of have to agree with Spike Lee.  I'm a 44-year-old guy, born and raised, like, in the northwest side of Chicago.  And 30-plus years ago, we would kick and cry for the services that the upper-middle white  people that moved into my area get now.  We were just a forgotten bunch. 
[02:58:30]  Are you a black guy or a white guy?  Hispanic, obviously.  I'm half Latin and half white.  Oh, Zimmerman.  Yeah, a little Zimmerman action.  The Latin part's coming through loud and clear, though.  Well, no.  So what?  You guys would yell and scream for the same services, but you've got to wait for the white  people to move in to the neighborhood to get those services that you just always wanted.  Well, let me rephrase it.  It would just take a lot longer for us to get that same service you get now.  Yeah, it's really good to be white, I've got to tell you, man. 
[02:59:00]  It's amazing.  It comes down to money, though.  It comes down to money.  White people bring the fucking money in.  But there was also Latin and black families that were working at the time.  You make it sound like none of us were working.  No, I understand, but it's just simple numbers game.  It's just numbers.  Why wouldn't you pay higher taxes?  Because you're not making enough money, and that area doesn't have good schools that require 
[02:59:30]  higher taxes.  Then Whitey moves in and...  Nobody's complaining about the taxes.  I mean, I've never said anything about taxes.  We were willing...  I'm saying that's how the area gets what it needs.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  We have to cut it short, because we've got a very smart guy coming in next.  Also, I've made this stupid mistake, which I've done a million times, I've got to be  honest with you.  It's Mark David Chapman. 
[03:00:00]  Of course it is.  Oh, yeah.  You said Henkley, right?  I didn't catch you.  I do that a lot, though, with those two.  Do you?  I always have to.  Yes.  You're going to back me on this one?  Who is that?  Which one was that?  Wait a minute.  Leto played Mark David Chapman, of course.  Of course he did.  But for some reason, I do that a lot with Henkley and Mark David Chapman.  It was around the same time they fucking, you know, they kind of did have a similar  look.  They did, right?  Yeah.  I think that's why.  I do that a lot.  They're very confusing.  Sorry about that. 
[03:00:30]  We're going to take a break, and we've got Bob Green.  Brian.  Brian Green.  Brian Green.  I've done that one twice today, too.  Brian Green is in the studio.  Oh, yes.  Jimmy, go ahead.  Jimmy.  Yeah, I got to Ontario, California.  All you people who asked me to come back, I'm coming back.  Where are you?  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Virginia Beach, the Funny Bone, March 20 through 22.  And then Tampa, April 11 and 12, and New York City, Carolines, April 24 through 27,  has just gone on sale. 
[03:01:00]  Nice.  Yeah, let's hope so.  I like when Jimmy's at Carolines.  Me, too.  I go see you.  We're going to get our minds blown next with Brian Green.  Stay there.  I hope he and Anthony will be right back.  On Sirius XM, feel free to rub one out.  Hey, everybody.  Christopher Mad Dog Russo here.

[03:08:30]  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and Antony Show.  On Sirius XM.  On Sirius XM.  On Sirius XM.  See you once  A kiss  The golden shore  The sunlight  Wants your skin  What?  You like his voice? 
[03:09:00]  I like his voice.  How do you not like his voice?  That's an amazing  Singing voice.  I like Bono's voice.  I just  I'm not a big fan  Of most of their music.  I like some of their songs.  I really like them.  I like that one.  Hey, man.  Hello, sir.  Brian Green in studio.  We're listening to some U2, sir.  From the Oscars last night.  And yapping over it.  And we're yapping over it  because I think he has an amazing voice.  Yeah.  It's good. 
[03:09:30]  Very melodic.  Yeah.  Well, good for him.  Brian, you watched the Oscars last night?  You know, my wife was watching.  I was in the other room.  I popped my head out every time she laughed.  So you're in the other room  trying to figure out the universe  and she's trying to see  what these ladies are wearing.  The Oscars.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, she loved it.  I heard not everybody else did,  but she did.  What were you doing?  What were you doing in the other room?  Honestly, I was doing some calculations.  Oh, yeah.  I told you. 
[03:10:00]  I mean...  Having to do with black holes.  See, I told you.  Damn.  What did you come up with?  You know, I should have watched the Oscars.  And who checks your math?  You know, the math checks itself.  In the end.  Yeah.  I mean, if the results don't make any sense,  that's the wonder of math.  It kind of slaps you in the face and says,  this doesn't work.  And it's self-correcting.  So, that's the beauty of doing equations.  Tell me about it.  I disagree with your philosophy on mirror symmetry. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know if I'm 100% in agreement with that.  But before we talk about it,  could you explain what it is?  Mirror symmetry.  You know what?  Einstein taught us this amazing thing.  The shape of space affects what we observe.  Each shape yields different physics.  What we found is, unbeknownst to Einstein,  you can have two different shapes  that yield exactly the same universe.  And those shapes are called mirror shapes,  if they do that.  Now for the quiz.  Uh-huh.  Okay. 
[03:11:00]  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means.  Is there two universes?  Well, you would have thought,  Einstein would have looked at these two different shapes  for the universe.  These are two different universes.  Clearly, period, you know, that's it.  But when we do the more refined approach  to the laws of physics  that we are trying, struggling to develop,  an approach called string theory,  we don't know if it's right yet,  but within this approach,  you can have two different shapes.  You look at them, they look different,  but yet in a mysterious quantum mechanical way,  they yield identical universes. 
[03:11:30]  Hmm, that's...  It's like, you know, you take a word, right?  Let me take the word cat.  What's that in Spanish?  Gato?  I don't remember my name.  Gato.  Yeah, right.  So you look at those two words,  they look completely different.  Cat and gato.  But yet, they are the same thing.  Uh-huh.  Secretly, there's a dictionary  that takes one to the other.  That's the same thing that we found,  a dictionary that takes one shape  to another shape,  same universe,  the cat.  So is that what string theory is?  String theory?  No, it's not.  No.  Well, it's a part of string theory. 
[03:12:00]  String theory is an attempt  to realize a dream, again,  that Einstein had,  which was to find  what he called the unified theory,  which would be one idea,  one master equation  that might describe everything.  Wow.  If Einstein is number one,  who's number two?  Because everyone always refers  to Einstein.  Who was the second guy?  Well, I don't even know  if he's number one.  It's a tie, I think,  between him and Isaac Newton.  Okay.  I mean, Newton obviously  was a long time ago,  and what he did  doesn't have the same  kind of sophistication.  We teach it, you know,  to high school kids, 
[03:12:30]  whereas Einstein,  we teach to the graduate students  for the most part.  But Newton was going  from nothing, right?  There wasn't anything before him  that he was really deeply  building upon.  This guy just sort of  looked out at the world,  at the planets, the moon,  and realized that  the force governing the moon  is the same force  that governs a rock  when you throw it,  you know, from here to there.  Why would that be the case?  That's a deep insight.  It's gravity, right?  But who would have thought  that it's the same physics  that governs up there 
[03:13:00]  and down here?  So he kind of united  the terrestrial  and the extraterrestrial  in a new way of thinking  about how the world works.  Yeah, Einstein kind of  had a head start.  Yeah.  So he could work  off of other people's work.  Now, he was still  a pretty bright dude.  I'm not trying to  take anything away from him.  Maybe how good he would  do with a computer.  He did a lot of shit  by hand.  You're actually right.  I sometimes wonder about that.  You know, if you were  to go back to the great geniuses,  you know, even Galileo  or Newton or even,  you know, further back,  you know, Pythagoras,  you know, if these guys 
[03:13:30]  had the computational power  that we have,  what would they have done?  Nothing.  They'd be looking at porn.  That's it, probably, right?  The history of civilization  would have been  completely, you know,  an alternate universe, right?  Nothing happened.  They had the computer  too soon.  What are you bad at?  Because you're so good  at this, right?  The universe, astronomy,  and math, and all that.  What are you bad at?  Well, you know,  my wife is here.  She's probably got a few things.  A whole bunch of things. 
[03:14:00]  But where your brain  is just not...  I've got an awful memory  for faces.  I meet people,  and then, like,  the next day,  I meet them again,  and I'm like,  hey, how are you doing?  And they're like,  we spoke yesterday.  Oh, wow.  So that's constant.  Wait, is that all...  Because Dr. Kaku,  we've had Michio Kaku in here.  He doesn't recognize us.  And I see him all the time,  and he never remembers  that we've interacted with him.  And he's very scared.  I will remember your face.  I'm going to have it  emblazoned right here.  Yeah.  But I wonder if that's  because you guys are so focused  on more important stuff  than just people's dumb faces. 
[03:14:30]  You guys don't have time  for nonsense.  Like, you're not watching  the Oscars last night.  Of course you're not.  No, but I did pop in.  I did pop in.  I saw some of Ellen's jokes.  Okay.  Pretty good, right?  I saw the pizza.  And the selfie.  I saw that.  Oh, okay.  That was a big story, yeah.  Are you constantly thinking  about, like, physics?  Is it always...  Like, when you make a turn  in your car,  are you assessing  the centrifugal force?  You know, it's an interesting thing.  At some level, yes.  It's like it's always there  because physics... 
[03:15:00]  You know, many people  think of it as, like,  some subject  that they were forced  to take in high school  and they were so thrilled  when they, like, finished it  and they could just forget  about the whole thing.  But that's sort of  a tragic perspective.  And it hurts me  when I see that  that's how kids view physics.  Physics is a way  of understanding reality,  of engaging with the world,  of making sense, really,  of your own existence  in the deepest possible way.  Can I defend those students, though?  Yeah, please do.  It's how they taught it.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:15:30]  There's got to be a better way  to teach some of these  tougher subjects  to get you into it.  No, no, I agree completely.  It just felt like a drag  when you're in that classroom.  I like trying to learn that.  A lot of applications  of things, too,  especially in physics  because it's with you every day.  You're walking in it constantly.  Like when you're driving  and maybe it's snowing out,  you have to assess  the friction on the road  and your car  and your speed  and you're constantly  putting it on check  and that's all physics.  No, no, I completely agree with you.  I mean, I don't want to go  like Mr. Plugging stuff here,  but one thing 
[03:16:00]  that we're doing right now  is trying to change  the way people teach physics.  We have this new thing,  this World Science U  that is going to go live  on Thursday or so.  And the whole point  is to inject  a whole level of visualization  into these abstract ideas.  I mean, you teach any kid  the laws of physics.  Even from Newton,  they're so abstract  if you haven't encountered  that way of thinking before.  Yeah.  But if you can turn  abstract ideas  into vibrant visuals,  all of a sudden  they make sense. 
[03:16:30]  I mean, I've been at a blackboard  with like a piece of chalk  trying to teach kids,  you know,  about some of the features  of, say, black holes  or the slowing of time  and relativity.  Weird and wonderful ideas.  But it's hard for them  to get it  and I'm trying to scratch  on the board.  And you talk about  what I do poorly.  I am really bad  as an artist.  I have the,  you know,  my kids make better diagrams  than I do.  But if you use the power  of the digital  to create real sharp  visualizations of things,  then I see the kids  get it like in a moment. 
[03:17:00]  They're like,  oh yeah, I see.  I get it.  I really can now  put it in my mind.  And that's what we're  trying to do,  to change.  So that's the,  that's the norm  of the experience  in the classroom  as opposed to the usual  where you're like,  oh my God,  I don't get it.  Right.  What are the odds  that Einstein was wrong?  Like,  because he was such a genius.  He was for certain wrong  in some deep sense.  Even Einstein himself  knew that he was taking  an incremental step forward  and giving us  a deeper understanding  of space  and time  and gravity.  But he knew  that it wasn't  the end of the story 
[03:17:30]  because the way physics  and science  more generally works  is people understand  something in one era  and then in a later era  they expand  the understanding.  They typically don't  wipe out  what happened in the past.  Newton is still with us,  right?  We do still teach Newton  and it's good that we do  because it's a close  approximation  to the truth  but Einstein did  a better job  and 10,  100 years from now  somebody else  is going to do  a better job still.  It's very difficult  to grasp the concept 
[03:18:00]  of space  as anything more  than a giant  endless void.  And when you talk  about things like  traveling from point A  to point B  and making it  shorter distance  by folding space  on itself  and putting those points  closer together,  it's hard to conceptualize it  because you're not  thinking of it  in this two-dimensional  piece of paper look.  It's a,  like I said,  a big void.  And when you talk  about different shapes  containing the same  universe,  again, 
[03:18:30]  how do you give  something a shape  when, again,  it's just this infinite  Yeah,  no,  I understand  the challenge  that that presents  because when we  think about shapes,  we always think  about them  as a shape  within space,  right?  You got the shape  of your water bottle  that you were just  drinking from,  you know,  the shape of my coffee  got the shape  of the microphone,  they're all objects  within space.  When you think  about space itself,  it seems like,  well,  how can it have  a shape?  Right.  It's the container.  It's just like  the whole thing  that goes on forever. 
[03:19:00]  And the problem  is that we have  difficulty thinking  in higher dimensional  spaces,  right?  And that's why  we use lower dimensional  versions like  the piece of paper  to stand in.  It's a proxy  for space,  if you will.  Just because  our brains  are kind of limited  in trying to  grasp these ideas.  And it makes  perfect sense  that our brains  are limited.  I like how you  say ours.  Thank you for that.  No, you know,  it is.  You mean yours.  No, no, no.  I do not mean it all.  This is a collective 
[03:19:30]  effect.  And I'll tell you why.  It's evolution.  Right?  So our forebears,  when they were out there  like on the savannah  trying to survive,  if they sat down  to contemplate  the shape of space,  they got eaten.  Right?  So there was no  evolutionary advantage  to trying to  understand reality  in a deep way.  What you had to  understand there were  the very basic things  like, where do I  throw the rock,  you know,  to hit the antelope  so I get my dinner.  And that's why,  for instance,  if I take this  water bottle,  right,  and I throw it at you,  you know where to 
[03:20:00]  put your hand  to catch it.  Even though you're  not doing a  Newtonian calculation  in your mind,  you have an intuition  about it.  And that's evolution  is impressed upon us.  You throw a bottle,  he will catch it.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Are you ready?  Are we going to do this?  Are we going to do it?  Here we go.  And there.  All right,  he caught it.  I just made my point.  And that's why  these ideas are so  hard for us  because we're going  against evolutionary  pressure in trying  to understand things  that we didn't need  to know to get  the next meal.  But now we kind of 
[03:20:30]  have the next meal  right in front of us.  And we're not just  thinking about survival  any longer.  We're trying to go  deeper.  The bigger picture  now.  Yeah.  Keep expanding out.  That's right.  And therefore,  we're kind of pushing  the boundaries  of what our brains  are capable of.  Can you explain  what string theory  means?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's supposed to be  like the smallest,  the lowest common  or the tiniest  common thing.  That's right.  That's right.  So, you know,  we all learned  in high school  at some point  that matter, 
[03:21:00]  if you take  any piece of wood,  you cut it in half,  keep cutting it  into smaller pieces,  sooner or later  you get to molecules.  The molecules  are made up  of atoms.  The atoms,  we learned,  have these little  electron particles  swirling around  the center,  which is called  the nucleus,  which has neutrons  and protons  inside of it,  and perhaps you  also know that  inside neutrons  and protons  are quarks,  right?  So,  the conventional  picture is that  these ingredients  are little tiny dots.  They don't have  any inner machinery  inside of them.  The idea of 
[03:21:30]  string theory,  and I underscore  this is an idea.  We do not know  that this is correct,  but if you take  an electron,  according to string theory,  and look deeply  inside,  you would see  something else.  A little tiny filament,  a little tiny  string-like filament,  and that's why  it's called  string theory,  and that filament  can vibrate  in different patterns.  And the idea is  when the string  is vibrating  in one way,  it is an electron.  When the string  is vibrating  a different way,  it is a quark.  Vibrating yet another way,  it's a photon,  a particle of light.  So all of the particles 
[03:22:00]  making up reality  are now unified  into one rubric,  one idea.  They all arise  from the different  vibrations of a string.  So in a kind  of poetic way,  the music played  by these little  tiny strings  results in all  of the rich structure  we see in the world  around us.  That's the idea.  Why string, though?  Yes.  Why do they come up  with that?  Why do they say  it will be a bent string?  And if it's a bent string  and nothing is smaller,  couldn't you theoretically  cut it in half?  Yes. 
[03:22:30]  So what would you get  if you cut a string  in half?  No, it's a good question,  right?  Well, it's kind of like,  you know,  if you have an earthworm  and you cut it in half,  you still have an earthworm.  And the idea here  is that at least  in one formulation,  you cut a string,  you'd still have string.  You wouldn't find  anything new  and surprising.  No new ingredient.  Now, having said that,  these ideas  are at the cutting edge  and there are people  investigating your question  who are suggesting  that the math  maybe is telling us 
[03:23:00]  that there is  something finer  and that the string  itself is just  a stepping stone  and there is  a deeper ingredient  yet to be found inside.  I don't even know  how they incorporate  math into that.  Like, that's,  to me,  is, like,  to, what you just  talked about,  we can visualize it  and, okay,  I understand exactly  what you're saying.  A piece of string  inside a ball  or something.  We're still in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the second  it starts,  it turns into equations, 
[03:23:30]  it's gone.  That's the tricky step  for many people  because, you know,  what is math?  Math is really just  a language  that many of us  are less familiar with  than ordinary  natural languages,  you know,  English or French.  That's all that it is.  It's a language  that's optimally suited  for analyzing  a certain class  of problems.  Now, in this case,  how do we see  a string in the math?  Well, it's actually  not all that hard  to think about. 
[03:24:00]  You know,  if you have an ordinary  string on a guitar  or violin,  you know,  you pluck it,  it gives a certain note.  But it also has  certain overtones  associated with it,  right?  When you pluck  that string,  there are a mixture  of notes,  if you will,  that are all  coming together  to yield the sound  of a violin.  Each of those  different notes  is a different  frequency of vibration.  And we have equations  that tell us  what the frequencies  of vibrations  of these strings  would be.  And that's how  we see that it's a string.  We see a certain  pattern of vibrations  and we're like, 
[03:24:30]  ah, that pattern,  that's the pattern  of a vibrating string.  Does that help at all?  Yeah, because that  can be turned  into some type  of numerical value.  Yes, that's right.  That's right.  Yeah, a frequency.  Yeah.  And when you talk  about tearing  the fabric of space-time,  what does that mean?  Yeah, so this is work  that I was fortunate  to be involved  with a number  of years ago  where, you see,  in Einstein's theory  of general relativity,  it's called,  which is this theory  of the force of gravity,  Einstein taught us  that space can curve, 
[03:25:00]  it can warp.  You can think of  sort of space  as almost like  a rubber sheet,  going back to that  two-dimensional version  that's not as satisfying,  but let's just use it  because we can wrap  our minds around it.  So, you know,  you imagine you have  a big bowling ball  and a rubber sheet,  it kind of curves  the sheet.  Similarly, the sun  curves the space  around it.  But here's the thing,  in Einstein's approach,  space can bend,  it can warp,  but it can't rip.  In Einstein's equations,  if space were to rip,  the equations break down,  the universe grinds  to a halt,  that's not something 
[03:25:30]  that we expect  could happen.  We reanalyzed  that issue  of the tearing of space  in this more refined  set of equations  that come from  string theory,  and we found  that in this  refined approach,  space can tear.  It can rip apart  and reconnect  in a way that doesn't  cause the universe  to grind to a halt.  The math just smoothly  sails through this tear  in the fabric of space,  no catastrophe at all.  So it was a kind  of surprising result.  Nobody anticipated  that this would be 
[03:26:00]  the new repertoire  of potential behaviors  when you go beyond  Einstein's approach.  Wow.  I love what happens,  like what happens  at that moment,  like is it just like  a chalkboard  and they'll say,  oh, that's it.  In terms of how  we found it  or in terms of,  yeah, yeah.  No, it really was.  I was actually  at the Institute  for Advanced Study  in Princeton  when we were doing  this work  some years ago  and it all boiled  down to an equation,  a mathematical equation,  and we had been  working months  to get this equation.  And literally, 
[03:26:30]  we were applying it  to an example  where if the answer  came out to be 12,  not a joke,  if it came out to be 12,  that meant  the fabric of space  could tear  and any other number  it wouldn't.  And we had this  computer program  that was ready to go  and a friend of mine  had written the code.  It was Friday  when we were done  and ready to go.  He was going home  and we said,  look,  can't you come back  tomorrow morning?  Yeah, you know,  seriously,  I said,  can you come back  tomorrow morning?  We've been on this  for months.  He was like,  no,  I don't work  on the weekend.  I was like,  are you serious, man?  We're like on the verge 
[03:27:00]  of that.  He says,  look,  you get me a six-pack  and I'll be there.  You know,  so it's a six-pack.  This guy,  Paul Aspinwall  is now at Duke.  So we got him,  we got him the six-pack.  He came in  and we ran the code  and it didn't come out 12.  It came out like 3.999  or something like that.  And I was like,  oh my God,  all these like months of work  and it was down the drain.  But then we realized  3.999,  that's like really close  to four.  Four kind of divides 12  by a factor of three. 
[03:27:30]  Maybe we lost a factor of three  in our math.  So we went back,  went through all the equations,  painstakingly,  goodness graces,  we found that we'd made  an error of a factor of three,  put it back in,  ran the code again,  it came out 11.99999,  which is 12 in computer speak  with the round off errors.  We showed that the fabric  of space could tear.  Oh my God.  What does it mean to tear though?  Like for the fabric  of space to tear,  I mean,  I know what a rip is,  but like how did...  Literally, yeah.  I'm talking about the same thing. 
[03:28:00]  And what causes it to rip?  Well,  there are processes  in string theory  where that is what they do.  So in Einstein's  general relativity,  the fabric can stretch  or warp  based upon  the presence of matter  or energy.  And what we found is  just like with  an ordinary piece of material,  if you warp it  or stretch it far enough,  it will tear,  the same thing  can happen  with the fabric  of space.  Fundamentally  changing its shape 
[03:28:30]  by virtue of a tear  and allowing it  to reconnect.  So what would do that?  Like a black hole?  Black holes,  we think,  have the capacity  to have that kind  of effect on space,  but we don't understand  black holes well enough.  Yet that's right  at the frontier.  So deep in the center  of a black hole  is something we call  a singularity.  You may have heard  that word sometimes  brought up in cosmology  and in black holes.  And singularity  is a euphemism  for we don't know  what the hell 
[03:29:00]  is going on.  That's all that it means.  It means that the equations  are breaking down  and we need to find  more sophisticated tools  to understand  what's happening.  And right now,  there must be,  you know,  400 people  around the world  that every single day  are thinking deeply  about what's happening  in black holes,  what happens at the edge.  There's a lot of controversy  that's been stirred up  recently.  So I don't know.  Black holes may be  this kind of beast  that yields other kinds  of rips in the fabric  of space,  but we don't know yet 
[03:29:30]  for sure.  I've really had enough  of the speed of light.  I'm tired of it.  Just enough already.  They're like,  gosh,  it's 186,000 miles a second.  You've had it.  Enough with it.  I bet you there's  something faster.  They keep saying no,  no, no.  Well, there was an experiment  you may have heard of  where they had some neutrinos  that little tiny particles  that were leaving  the Large Hadron Collider  in Geneva  traveling through the Earth  to a detector  in Grand Sasso in Italy.  And the initial measurement  showed that the neutrinos  were showing up  16 nanoseconds 
[03:30:00]  earlier than they could have  even if they were traveling  at the speed of light.  They were traveling faster  than the speed of light  according to the measurements  arriving in Italy  a little bit early.  Now,  when we heard that,  we said,  no,  that can't be true.  I mean,  one of the quick ways  you knew it couldn't be true  is nothing arrives  early in Italy,  right?  So that's after the get-go  right there.  But, you know,  but more scientifically,  there is a mountain  of experimental support  behind Einstein's  special theory  of relativity  which says that 
[03:30:30]  the speed of light  is the speed limit.  So one little measurement  would never convince us.  We would need  a hundred measurements  confirmed by,  you know,  ten different research groups  around the world  before we'd say,  wow,  maybe there's something to this.  So all of us,  well,  most of us,  came out and said,  this can't be right.  We're not convinced of this.  And a little while later,  the research group  did find a little error  in their equipment.  You know,  a faulty wire  which when corrected  showed that the neutrinos  were not going fast  in the speed of light.  So based on everything 
[03:31:00]  that we know today,  the speed of light  does still seem  to be the limit  for how fast  something can travel  through empty space.  It just seems like  there is a simplistic way  to get around that.  Like if you're traveling  at the speed of light,  you throw a ball  in front of you.  The ball is technically,  not technically,  literally traveling faster  than light.  So you would think.  You would think.  You would think  based on your  Newtonian intuition  that came from  being able to eat  that antelope  in the savannah. 
[03:31:30]  Exactly.  Now,  that's actually  the beautiful thing  because what Einstein  showed is  when you throw  that ball  from that train  that's going,  say,  really near the speed of light,  normally you'd say  to yourself,  well,  how do you get  the speed of the ball?  Well,  you take the speed  of the train  plus the speed  at which you threw  the ball,  add them together  and that gets  the new speed  of the ball  relative to somebody  watching this  say from the ground.  And Einstein says  that reasoning  works at low speeds  but it fails,  completely fails  at high speeds. 
[03:32:00]  There's a new way  of combining velocities  that comes into play  which doesn't just  add them together.  It adds them together  and then corrects it  by another factor  which always ensures  that the combined speed  is less than  the speed of light.  But then the ball  would never  be moving away from you.  Nah,  it depends on your  perspective.  So for the person  on the train,  the ball is moving  away from them  at a speed of  maybe 100 miles an hour.  Let's say you're  Mariano Rivera  or something,  you're throwing the baseball,  it's going away from you  at 100 miles an hour or so. 
[03:32:30]  The person on the ground  watching the ball  does not see its speed  to be your speed  plus 100 miles an hour.  They see it to be  less than that  in a manner that  always brings the total  under the speed of light.  Now,  this is not just  something weird  about speed  and something that  tickles the brain  because what is speed?  Speed is a measure  of how far you go  divided by how long  it takes you to get there.  That means it's a measure  of space,  how far you go,  divided by a measure 
[03:33:00]  of time.  So what Einstein  is telling is that  space and time  don't behave  as we would think  based on everyday experience.  Space and time  have weird,  unexpected properties.  That's what he showed us  in Special Relativity.  It's easier to grasp  at thinking in those terms  than just speed.  Yes, exactly.  Because, you know,  when you hear about speed,  you're like,  well, that's just sort of,  you know,  weird and curious,  but who really cares  that much about speed per se?  But when you talk  about space and time,  look, everything we do, 
[03:33:30]  everything we think,  everything we experience  takes place in some region  of space  during some interval of time.  So if space and time  are not behaving  as you would think,  that means reality  is not behaving  as you would think.  I got a couple questions.  Where are you at with God?  Well, you know,  I'm sitting next to him.  A few things.  Where are you at with God  and other life out there?  Well, you know,  for God,  my view is that 
[03:34:00]  there may well be  a God, right?  I have no evidence  to convince me  that there is.  All of my understanding  of physics suggests  that that's all  that we need  and to understand  at least the nature  of the physical universe.  But that doesn't prove  there isn't a God  out there.  So my view is  if what we are doing  as physicists  is, say,  working out God's laws  in some secret way,  I'm thrilled  to be part of that journey.  That's a pretty deep  thing to do.  And if there is no God, 
[03:34:30]  as I suspect there isn't,  and all we're doing  is working out  the laws of physics  that brought the universe  into existence  and governed its evolution,  if that's what we're doing,  I'm happy to be part  of that journey.  So from a day-to-day perspective,  it doesn't really affect  what I do.  Now, from the perspective  of other life out there,  you know,  that's one of those  very difficult questions  for a scientist  to answer  because the only way  we'll know  is by encountering  that other life. 
[03:35:00]  Now, there are all  these people  who talk about  making estimates  of the likelihood  of life being out there,  but all those estimates  are based on things  that we just fundamentally  don't know.  Sure, we can now  gain some insight  into the number of planets  that are out there,  the number of planets  that are similar,  in a sense,  to Earth  in terms of conditions  that would be hospitable  to our form of life,  but we don't know  how life really gets started.  The raw material  seems to be ubiquitous  out there  to give rise  to our form of life.  What sparks life 
[03:35:30]  to get going?  That's still an unknown  for us,  and that's why  it's difficult to judge.  But if you're asking  me just sort of  in a gut,  completely informal sense,  do I think  there's life out there?  Yeah, I think  that there is.  A lot of it, too, right?  If there is  any other life,  I suspect  that there is a lot.  Right.  Yeah.  I have a light speed question.  Yeah.  You love this light speed.  I really do,  because two things  that interest me about it,  like, first of all,  when you're traveling  light speed,  aren't you seeing 
[03:36:00]  what's behind you as well?  Well, you can't actually  travel at light speed.  If you could,  theoretically,  wouldn't you see  what the light is?  Well, here's the thing.  Sometimes if one asks  a theoretical question,  the reason why  the answer seems  so confusing  is because it's  a perspective  that you could  absolutely never have  in principle.  So what I'd say  is if you go  very, very close  to the speed of light,  you can look out  at the world  and ask yourself  what you would see.  And I've got  some fantastic animation  to show you  what you would literally see.  I can't obviously  do it here on the radio,  but the world  would look 
[03:36:30]  slightly strange.  It would look  kind of curved  and warped  and features of it  that are completely  unexpected  based on slow speeds  would start  to become  readily apparent.  You know,  if you watch  the taxi cab  going down,  say, Fifth Avenue  near the speed of light,  right,  what would that  taxi cab look like?  It would be  shrunken  to a very,  very thin  width  and it would be  twisted as it's  going by.  So, you know,  an ordinary taxi cab,  what is it,  10 feet long? 
[03:37:00]  It might be  one inch long  as it's rushing  by you  because that's  what happens  to space  at high speeds.  Again,  that connection  between speed  being space  per time,  that's what  would happen.  And if you were  to look at a clock  inside that taxi cab  as it's rushing by,  that clock  and everything  inside the taxi cab  would be  ticking slowly.  People in the taxi cab,  their eyes  would be blinking slow.  Everything goes slow  because time itself  slows down  at high speeds. 
[03:37:30]  That is so...  Is there like a  way you can  kind of visualize  with the speed of sound  when you get  that Doppler effect  with that?  Is there any  kind of similarity  between that?  It can,  but it doesn't  really bring out  the weirder side  of things.  So it is the case,  as you're saying,  you know,  if an ambulance  is rushing toward you  and it goes,  that kind of thing.  Right, exactly.  So that's the Doppler effect,  which is how  the wavelength 
[03:38:00]  of a signal,  a wave,  is affected  by the motion  of the source.  That happens  with light, too.  So if an object  is coming toward you,  it'll look bluer.  If it's rushing  away from you,  it will look redder.  That's the analog  of the siren sound  sort of going up  and down  in terms of  the pitch  of the siren.  But the weirder part,  though,  is the speed,  as we're talking about,  not the frequency  of the waves,  but rather the speed  that the signal  is traveling.  And that is  different for light. 
[03:38:30]  That's a strange feature  that's very hard  to grasp,  and you just  ultimately have to  accept it.  Because if you were  to say to me,  why is it that  the speed of light  is constant?  Why is it that  nothing could go faster  than the speed of light?  At some deep level,  I have to tell you,  I don't know.  Because that's the way  it is.  I could imagine  a universe  where it's not the case.  Logically,  I can imagine  a world where  Newton got it right.  Late 1600s,  he figured it all out,  and that's all  that there was.  And everything behaved 
[03:39:00]  according to intuition.  That would be  a kind of boring universe,  certainly for a  21st century physicist  like me,  because nothing  would have happened  in the last 500 years  or something.  So we looked  to Einstein,  and I said,  you know,  I thank Einstein  for his insights,  because it made  the world so much  deeper and richer  for us to figure out.  And who doesn't  get totally  bowled over  by time slowing down  or space crunching  at high speeds?  It's spectacular. 
[03:39:30]  But did it have  to be that way?  Hard for me to say  that it had to be  that way,  but it is that way.  What are some  of the things  we'll be able to do  with the knowledge  we have now,  let's say in the next  20 years,  some of the things  that you think  will be possible?  Well,  I take a step back  and just,  it's good to remember  that,  you know,  Einstein's ideas,  those ideas of  quantum mechanics,  which is,  you know,  the physics  of the small things,  electrons and molecules  and atoms,  that has allowed us  already to create  almost everything  in this room, 
[03:40:00]  right?  So personal computers,  cell phones,  all manner of  medical technology,  anything with an  integrated circuit  comes from  quantum physics.  Without quantum physics,  you wouldn't have  all that stuff.  You know,  some have estimated  something like  35% of the gross  national product  comes from  quantum mechanics.  So already,  fundamental physics  has,  in a profound way,  changed our lives.  Where will these  discoveries lead us  in the next 20,  30 years? 
[03:40:30]  I don't know.  And I'm sort of  excited to say that  because...  Do you have any  hunches, though?  Yeah, well,  you know,  what are we trying  to figure out these days?  So with string theory,  we're really trying  to take Einstein's ideas  and push them further  and really understand  the basic structure  of space and time.  If these ideas are correct,  could it be that  in the distant future,  I'm not talking 20 years,  I'm talking, you know,  maybe 20,000 years,  would that allow us  to manipulate space  and time?  Maybe.  I mean,  that's the rhythm  of science.  You understand  something deeply, 
[03:41:00]  then you start  to use your understanding  to manipulate it.  I don't mean in some dark way,  but, you know,  you just take control  over it.  Now we can manipulate  the motion of electrons,  and that's why  you have your cell phone.  Well,  could we ultimately  use our understanding  to manipulate space  and time?  Would that yield  to fantastic space travel  or time travel?  In the wild imaginings,  yeah,  I could at least envision  that as a possibility.  And what is the...  They discover  the God particle.  What exactly 
[03:41:30]  does that mean?  Yeah,  that's this thing  called the Higgs particle,  the Higgs boson,  and that's a particle  that was emergent  from the equations  in the 1960s.  But we didn't know  if it was true or not.  Again,  it was just math,  and then a machine  was built  in Geneva,  Switzerland,  and this little tiny particle  that the math said  should be there  is there.  Now,  what does it do?  This is a particle  whose corresponding field,  all particles  correspond to fields  that fill space  in this case,  and the Higgs field, 
[03:42:00]  we believe,  is a kind of  cosmic molasses.  Filling every nook  and cranny of space  so that as fundamental particles  like electrons or quarks  that try to move  through space,  they rub against  this molasses.  That kind of gives them  a resistance  that we consider  to be the mass  of the particle.  So why does an electron  have heft?  Why does it resist  when we push on it?  Answer,  according to these ideas,  it's rubbing against  this cosmic molasses,  the Higgs field.  Now,  this was math  in the 60s. 
[03:42:30]  I learned about it  as a grad student  in the 80s,  and for months  I thought it was real.  I didn't know  it was hypothetical  because the professor  was already so convinced  it was right,  he didn't even qualify  the description  when he was teaching  at the Blackboard,  but it was only  in 2012  that we got  the first solid evidence  that this is really real  from these collisions  at the Large Hadron Collider,  and now there's  a basic consensus  that these ideas  are correct.  So you're saying  the resistance  that you get  from mass  trying to move mass 
[03:43:00]  is that?  That's right.  Without the Higgs field,  the idea would be  that if you pushed  on any object,  it would be massless.  It wouldn't resist it at all.  It would just go  flying off  at the speed of light.  Right.  The reason why light  still travels  at light speed  is it can go through  the molasses  without interacting  with it at all.  That's one of the beauties  of this molasses.  Light just goes through it,  you know,  like a hot knife  through butter,  right?  Even more smoothly.  It just goes right through it.  But other particles  like the electrons 
[03:43:30]  or the quarks,  things of that sort,  they don't go through  so smoothly  and that resistance  is why they've got heft.  Interesting.  And what is the...  I feel it when I do this.  Yeah, you can feel it.  That's right.  That's right.  Now let me just point out  one little subtlety.  One little subtlety.  Sometimes people say  the heft of ordinary objects,  therefore,  like that book  or a coffee cup,  therefore,  also comes from  the Higgs field.  That's not quite true  because the objects  like protons,  which are collections  of quarks, 
[03:44:00]  there's an additional  source of their heft  that comes from the way  the quarks talk  to each other,  certain interactions.  It's called  the strong nuclear force.  The name doesn't matter much.  But that's where  the heft of ordinary  conglomerates come from.  But the fundamental  constituents  is what I'm talking about.  That's where they get  their heft  from the Higgs field.  That's a footnote.  Damn.  A little footnote.  Yeah.  I'll tuck that away.  Yeah.  Bring that up  to one of your next guests.  I've got a dog trainer  coming in. 
[03:44:30]  Awkward.  A long day  to book the dog trainer.  Oh, my God.  No, I love this stuff.  I really do.  My whole life,  I've been into it.  It just blows my mind.  Into it.  It's amazing.  What percentage  of gravity  on Earth  are the astronauts  experiencing?  I've heard  two different things.  Well,  if they are  in free fall,  then they aren't  experiencing anything.  So one of the  insights of Einstein  is that anybody  who is in free fall,  you jump out  of a building,  right? 
[03:45:00]  You're out there  in space  and you're in orbit,  which in essence  is an object  that's free falling  around the Earth.  You've canceled out  gravity.  This is called  Einstein's equivalence  principle.  You can cancel out  gravity by undertaking  a certain kind of motion,  which is basically  a free fall motion.  If, however,  a rocket out there  is accelerating,  then the people  will feel themselves  pushed against the seat  or against the floor  and they'll feel  something equivalent  to gravity.  Now,  if someone's not  in free fall  and they're literally  hanging out there,  then the amount 
[03:45:30]  of gravity  they're feeling  is pretty close  to what we are  experiencing here  on Earth.  Obviously,  it depends how far  away they are,  but I'm talking  if they're on the order  of a couple hundred  miles away,  the Earth itself,  what is it,  about 8,000 miles  in diameter or something,  so 4,000 in radius,  so 100 miles  is not that far.  It's going to grab you.  We're already,  right here on the surface  of the Earth,  pretty far from the center,  and that's what  it takes,  how much gravity  you feel,  how far you weigh  from the center  of the object. 
[03:46:00]  So the movie Gravity  was a comedy to you.  You know,  it's funny,  I was just,  with all the Oscar stuff,  I was asked about this  so many times  about the sort of  science gaffes  in gravity,  and my view is  I don't really care  as much about that.  I go to the movies  to let go of all  that you talk about  is physics always with you  when you're making  the left turn of the card,  you feel the centrifugal force.  It is.  So I like to sit there  in the movie  and let it all go  and just enjoy  what's happening.  So I'm not sitting there  like with my padded paper 
[03:46:30]  and saying,  oh,  they got that wrong  and they got this wrong.  But here's what  does bug me though.  If a movie  breaks the rules,  if a movie  breaks the rules,  right,  and they do it consistently,  so I buy into  this new set of rules,  I'm fine with that.  But if at the last minute  like a plot device  suggests to them  that they should now  buy into  a different set of rules  that contradict  the other rules  that they had me  buy into at the outset, 
[03:47:00]  I don't like that.  Then I feel like,  oh,  come on,  that's like lazy thinking.  But you want to bend the rules  and you do it  in a consistent way,  I'll go with you.  I'll go with you completely.  Buzz Aldrin said  that the way they moved  in space,  colliding,  all that stuff,  he said was fairly accurate  the way things  got banged around up there.  Yeah,  but I mean,  there are other things.  Again,  I wasn't sitting there  like critiquing  as a thing in my mind.  There's like a key moment  when like George Clooney  is holding on to  and it was a rope  or something.  You know,  Sandra Bullock  is like trying to keep him  from like flying out into space.  In reality,  once that thing pulled taut, 
[03:47:30]  there would be  no additional force  that would be causing him  to continue  to be pulling on it,  pulling on it.  And therefore,  that was a kind of  a weird moment.  But you know,  you can justify it in your mind.  If the entire object  was spinning around  like a merry-go-round.  Then it would want  to fling them off.  Then it would want  to fling them off.  So that's how  I would justify it in my mind.  You know,  they didn't show us  the spinning,  but it was really spinning  up there.  It must have really been  spinning.  Yeah.  Once they got that,  give them the benefit  of the doubt.  He definitely could have made it.  back with her 
[03:48:00]  because, yeah,  they really wouldn't have been...  Yeah, once that thing  pulls taut,  that's end.  You know,  then he basically  gets pulled back in.  Let's go to Dan in Atlanta.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just proved  my own scientific theory.  You put a physicist  on the O&A show  and the phone lines  are wide-ass open.  No, not really.  No, they're packed.  We just don't have time  to go to them.  They're packed.  They've been packed  since Brian Green  came in today.  Really?  It's worldscienceu.com,  by the way.  He's promoting that today.  Tell me this.  So you've seen this  through a number  of generations, right?  You've seen guys  that came through with you. 
[03:48:30]  I'm 34.  So when I went through school,  it was a little more  similar today  than when you went through  but still wasn't  like it is today.  How do you keep kids  interested in this stuff?  You know what I mean?  I mean,  you've got pioneers  of the past.  You've got them  into your decades.  You've got them  into my decades.  And I keep seeing  these young kids.  And it's like,  how do you get them  interested in this?  I mean,  you don't mind  if I take that one, guys?  Go ahead.  You know,  my view on that is  what we do wrong  is we teach science  as if it is 
[03:49:00]  a finished subject.  There it is  in the textbook  and you just have  to learn it.  That isn't going  to fire anybody up.  But if you teach science  as an ongoing  journey of discovery,  a dramatic story  of discovery,  as we have continued  to dig deeper  and find stranger  and stranger things  and that's where  we're heading off  into the future,  yeah,  then kids get real excited.  You know,  I can't tell you  the number of times  I've talked to a young  group of kids,  right,  and I'll tell them  something about black holes  or the Big Bang  or things like that  and their eyes  start to open wide.  They're like, 
[03:49:30]  whoa,  wow,  time slows down  near the black hole,  you know,  the beginning  of the Big Bang.  And then they often  say to me,  wait,  but that's science?  And I'm like,  yeah,  that's science.  It's not just  memorizing these things  that you spit back  on an exam.  And once kids  make that transition  to recognize  that there's such  wondrous stuff  still to figure  out,  many of them  have a very  different view  of science.  Yeah,  if you could tell  somebody that they  can be part  of a continuing  story that's going 
[03:50:00]  on,  of course it's  better than just,  here's this,  finish it,  and, you know,  report back to me.  Right, exactly.  Let's say hi  to Bob in Tucson.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, Dr. Green,  how you doing?  Good, how about you?  I'm in love  with the string theory  because I feel  it really fits in  with the whole concept  of what a lot of  people might conceive  as God  and a higher power.  And how does that  kind of figure in  with your thinking  and how can you  relate that to  the whole concept  of God  and being one  central controlling 
[03:50:30]  figure in the universe?  Yeah, we sort of  hit on this  a little bit earlier  and my view is  that physics  doesn't have a whole  lot to say  about God, right?  So we're trying  to figure out  the laws of physics  and apply them  to understand  reality around us.  And could God  be behind it all?  You know,  pulling the strings  so to speak?  Yeah, it's possible.  There's no evidence  for that.  So we keep it  in our mind  as a possibility  but we press on  with the equations,  with the experiments,  with the observations 
[03:51:00]  to just try to push  the procedures  of science forward.  But what about  the baby Jesus?  How does he fit in?  Yeah, how does  the baby Jesus  fit into all this?  Thank you, Bob.  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  I'm an agnostic  and, you know,  I really feel  that that's kind of  like the whole  controlling thing  throughout the universe  is this string theory  that can tie us  into different dimensions  and different ways  that when we die  that that's not  we don't just 
[03:51:30]  basically get snuffed out.  It's those thoughts  and those things  that have triggered  things throughout our life  that cause us  to be remembered  and cause ghosts  and those little things  that trickle  throughout the universe  that cause us  to be our essence  of what we are.  Does that kind of,  does that make sense?  I don't know.  Honestly,  I don't know  what happens  when you die  from the point of view  of physics.  Yeah,  from the point of view  of physics,  look,  it's a pretty subtle change  in the state  of your body  when you die. 
[03:52:00]  So if we're just  analyzing the physics  of what's going on  it's not completely obvious  that something dramatic  has happened.  We all are  electrical creatures.  I mean,  that's what basically  controls our whole body  is this electrical impulse  that runs through us.  and I just kind of feel  that some hairy guy  sitting up in space  somewhere granting wishes  doesn't make sense to me  but if you can kind of  grasp it through physics  that kind of makes  a whole lot of sense to me.  Yeah,  I agree.  It doesn't make a whole lot 
[03:52:30]  of sense to me either  but on the other hand  quantum mechanics  didn't make a whole lot  of sense to some of the  greatest geniuses  of the 20th century  and it turned out  to be right.  So the thing is  the only ideas  that I'm willing  to buy into  are ideas that have  a strong mathematical basis  which ultimately  are confirmed  by experiment  or observation.  That's the gold standard  and all these other things  that we talk about  with God  and I don't even know  what it means  in any deep rigorous sense.  I have an intuitive feel 
[03:53:00]  for what people mean  but you know  it's hard to test  that kind of an idea.  Right,  there's no way  to figure it out.  Now on the other hand  if the sky was to open  if the sky was to open  and the big man up there  said I'm here  I am God  I wonder  would I be convinced then  part of me says  well I guess I would  part of me feels like  maybe I checked myself  into Bellevue  at that point.  So I don't know  what exactly I'm looking for  when I say  where's the evidence.  What is that thing  they did with  Thank you Bob. 
[03:53:30]  What is that thing  they did where they had  like two  it was like a quantum  physics experiment  where two different  a particle  was in two places  at once.  Yeah, the entanglement  quantum entanglement.  I'm sorry to interrupt you  but my question was  is that a possibility  if that's real  is it possible  that it could be  from one place  to the other  faster than the speed of light?  Right, that's a deep  and difficult question.  It is the case  that in quantum mechanics  you can have a particle  over here  say in Los Angeles  another particle  in New York  such that you measure  the particle  in Los Angeles  and it seems to  instantaneously  have an effect 
[03:54:00]  on the result  of the measurement  on the particle  in New York.  They're 3,000 miles apart  but yet what you do  on one  seems to have an effect  on the other.  Einstein himself  called this spooky  spooky action  at a distance  and he said  you know  it can't really  be that way  but experiments  seem to establish  that it kind of  is that way  and you might say  well there you go  you've now done  something faster  than the speed of light  and actually you haven't  because there's no  information  that you can transmit  from one place  to another  faster than the speed  of light  rather it's a  correlation 
[03:54:30]  in their behaviors  by some weird  quantum effect  that we understand  the math of it  completely well  so I don't want  to leave you  a sense  that this is  a mystery  we understand  this  we do experiments  with this  we use it  but from the fact  of relativity  when Einstein  describes it  it's really  no information  no signal  can go from  place to place  at fashion  the speed of light  in this case  when you analyze  it closely  no information  would go from  Los Angeles  to New York  he couldn't say  sell Yahoo  or sell Amazon  stock  there'd be no way 
[03:55:00]  for that information  to be transmitted  through this influence  so in a sense  relativity survives  by the skin  of its teeth  but again  this is at the  cutting edge  and people  are still  trying to figure  this one out  and maybe  you know  if you have me  back at some  point  I'd say  you know what  you were right  we now understand  it better  and there's a real  issue  only because  it seems like  how could they  I mean I know  my mind can't  can you explain  this one a little  further Jimmy  not really  I think  Brian would probably  be better than I would  I think if you have  two particles  in two different locations  like you said  they both 
[03:55:30]  one reacts to the other  in a way  but you're saying  there's no information  being transmitted  yeah I can tell you  why  maybe in a minute  so one of the weird  things of quantum  physics is  we learn  that the best  you can ever do  in an experiment  is predict  the probability  of an outcome  that's the big break  of quantum physics  Newton says  you predict how  things will be  quantum mechanics  there's no Newton  you were a little  bit wrong on that  you only predict  30% chance of this  or 40% chance of that  so here's the idea  you can have two  particles in Los Angeles 
[03:56:00]  and New York  set up in the right way  where there's a 50-50 chance  that this particle  will say be red or blue  50-50 chance  that the one in New York  will be blue or red  okay  so it's a chancy thing  you measure the one  in Los Angeles  and say you find  it's blue  the one in New York  necessarily then  will be red  but that's weird  right  because how could  doing something  in Los Angeles  affect the color  of the one  in New York  but that's what  quantum mechanics  says happens  but now  how would you  transmit any information  with that 
[03:56:30]  well let's say  you had many  of these particles  in Los Angeles  and New York  you do a bunch  of measurements  in Los Angeles  red, blue, blue, red  maybe it comes out  the ones in New York  then will be the opposite  blue, red, red, blue  but there's no information  and that's just  a random list of colors  it's only when you  bring the two lists together  from Los Angeles  and New York  and compare them  that you say  oh wow  every time you got red  I got blue  every time you got blue  I got red  but that comparison  has to be done  slower than the speed of light  how do you get  the two lists together  you get on the phone 
[03:57:00]  you send an email  that communication  is slower than light speed  and only when  that communication happens  do you go  wow  something weird  is happening  you got red  I got blue  you got blue  I got red  it's only in the comparison  that's wild  right  because I was thinking  you could absolutely  transmit information  through those changes  but  to then coordinate  what they're each doing  slows you down  that's right  it's only the coordination  ultimately  which shows 
[03:57:30]  the information  and again  I'm just trying  to grasp it  if the coordination  shows the information  doesn't that mean  that the information  is there  even without us  knowing it  that's a good point  it's a tricky one  and that's why  people are still  struggling with these ideas  but as far as we can tell  right now  it's only when  the information  can literally be extracted  that you consider  the information  having been transmitted  so you might say  it's sort of latent  information  it's kind of there  but even though  it's there  if you can't extract it 
[03:58:00]  then we'd say  that the information  hasn't been transmitted  only when you bring  the list together  can you extract it  but that's a slower  than light procedure  because of the comparison  but does it happen  where like the things  where the one  will happen in Los Angeles  and it won't affect  the one in New York  or does it always affect it  you have to set things up  in a very careful way  for everything  we're talking about  to happen  so some people say  well okay  you set it up  to do that  what's so surprising  I'm telling you  it is surprising  I don't care what you do 
[03:58:30]  to set it up  if you're going to tell me  that there's a 50% chance  that this guy is red and blue  50% chance guy  that this is blue or red  and you measure this one  and then this one now  is 100% blue  because that one  turned out to be red  whereas before you  did your measurement  it was a 50-50 chance  that blows my mind  right there  I don't care  what kind of a magician  or how you set it up  that is amazing  and that's what  quantum mechanics is  can I have one more question  about what about  these  whatever they were  were they  I guess they were 
[03:59:00]  something small  were they changed  patterns  when they were being observed  yes  so that's a common occurrence  in quantum mechanics  that the act of observation  has an impact  on the thing  being observed  again  it's a new idea  in some sense  because  in Newton's physics  you could be very gentle  when you observe something  and that way  disturb it minimally  if you're a very good  experimenter  but quantum theory  says that  no matter how  delicate you are 
[03:59:30]  an observation  will have some  impact  on the thing  being observed  so take those  particles  we were just mentioning  the one in LA  that was 50% red  50% blue  when you measured it  it came out  100% red  say  so you changed  its pattern  its probabilistic pattern  it was 50-50  before you looked  then it was 100%  zero  after you looked  because it came out  red  and once it's red  it ain't gonna be blue  so that's an effect  of the observation  on the state 
[04:00:00]  of the object  itself  and that's a kind  of ubiquitous feature  in quantum reality  is it changing  because you observed it  or was it  always that way  but until you observed it  you wouldn't have known  there it is  so that's what  Einstein asked  that is exactly  what Einstein  and Einstein believed  Einstein believed  that it always was  red  but your description  was just a little bit  incomplete  and therefore you thought 
[04:00:30]  it was red or blue  that was Einstein's view  but amazing experiments  that have started  in the 80s  and through to today  have pretty much shown  that Einstein's view  of that was probably  not right  wacky haired bastard  it seems to be the case  that the object  really is  as far as we can tell  in a mixture  of these  distinct possibilities  and only snaps out  to a definite reality  upon observation  observation  it's almost the tree  falling in a forest  in a sense  nobody hearing  yeah that's interesting  I love it 
[04:01:00]  we got our next guest  outside the studio  I gotta tell you  Brian Green  thanks so much  for coming in  Brian Green  by the way  sorry  B-G-R-E-E-N-E  on Twitter  sorry the cable guy  is not starting to feel  showing his fat stomach  showing his gut  yeah  see that's what  this show's all about  yes  that's why  the eyebrow  for an hour  that was one of  the least pleasant  things I've ever seen  that's the god particle  is that why  you brought me in  by that I mean  slow and molasses like  yeah  slow and molasses like

Don't con me  Biff  Every year  thousands of  homeowners  oh they get  ripped off by  contractors  doing shoddy work  which often  leaves their homes  in dangerous  unsafe states  of disrepair  Now Adam Carolla  you heard right  Adam Carolla  on Spike TV  they've teamed up  to hammer  home some justice  with a new show  on Spike  called Catch a  Contractor  In the show  Adam searches out  and brings these  irresponsible contractors  back to face the 
[04:06:30]  families they've  shafted  and finish the job  they started  this time  doing it right  He nails  these guys  where it hurts  using private  investigator on his  team to hunt  them down  and confront them  hidden cameras  and everything  and the hacks  have to work  with Adam and  his team to  finish the project  or end up in  court  Man  it's that simple  are you asking  yourself why  is Adam Carolla  involved in a show  like this  before comedy  you know Adam  spent 10 years  working in construction  and he's actually 
[04:07:00]  a master carpenter  I did not know that  Catch a Contractor  premieres Sunday  March 9th  at 10 Eastern  9 Central  after an all new  episode of  Bar Rescue  only  on Spike  Yo what's up  this your boy  Ice Cube  the West Coast  Warlord  and you know  what I'm doing  kicking it down  we holding it down  for the West Coast  Yo I'm just telling  y'all  the encore  of the Opie and  Anthony show  is gonna start  at 11 a.m. 
[04:07:30]  on the east  and 8 a.m.  for my homies  on the west  Booyow  So if you miss  any of this shit  and you wanna hear  it all again  tune in  and check it out  tune in  and check it out  with Si Ye  throwing them  dubs up  opening and  Anthony are back  on Sirius XM  No dog right  always a dog  around  Cesar Millan  in studio  oh yeah  very busy day 
[04:08:00]  sorry to make you  wait a few minutes  outside the studio  I'm used to waiting  we had a physicist  yeah we were trying  to figure out the universe  a few minutes ago  work out the whole  universe thing  and then Larry  the cable guy  showed his gut  I know I saw it  I saw it  he needs exercise  he needs a little exercise  well you know  nobody shows him  who the top dog is  so he just kind of  runs around  that's the equivalent  of just laying on the couch  when we're not supposed to  yeah that's  misbehaved  you're like a classic  basset town  Cesar  you're back on track  there sir 
[04:08:30]  I am  you had a tough  little stretch there  I did  you know I went to  everything in life  is ups and downs  sure  things what make you  wise  and as a father  you wanna be prepared  for things to happen  to your kids  so I'm glad  it happened to me  right  you know  so I can  see the signs  and actually  give direction  you know  my role as a pack leader  is to give direction  and protection  right  but if I don't go  through experiences  in life  I will not be able  to convey the message  yeah  you had a lot of things  happen right in a row  yeah three years ago  the wife 
[04:09:00]  did she officially  divorce you at this point  that's right  I was in England  and I got a call  and I said  we're gonna divorce  wow  I know right  and so  but that was  did you see a comic  no that was the thing  that's what created  the shock  that's what created  the feeling of failure  right  because I wasn't aware  you know  I wasn't  I wasn't invited  to that  moment of departure  part  right  yeah so you feel  I felt personally  like a failure  so that's why  I went in a spiral  and normally  you know  I've got a lot of books 
[04:09:30]  and tip shows  and I got my papers  you know  so I feel  that I have succeeded  a lot in America  but then  you go through that  in life  and you were not prepared  I was not prepared  and so  and you really attempted suicide  is that true  yes I did  how  yes I did  well I took all the pills  that I could find  wow  you were serious  because we talk about it  on the show  no no no  we don't think the  well maybe I can say this  yeah no I didn't  when people  slit their wrists  we don't think they're as serious  as going all in with pills  no I didn't think  oh man 
[04:10:00]  I did it  I just took all of them  everything you can find  in the house  everything I can find  in the house  and how were you saved  well  the only thing I can tell you  you know  is I wasn't meant to die  wow  the doctor said  you could kill five people  with this  so  wow  you know you were not  meant to die  and  who found you  or did you realize it  my kids  my kids  yes it's a shocking thing  but  okay  yeah  we've all thought  we've all thought of it  at times  right before you  were doing it  what were you thinking  like oh no  they're going to find me  or did you kind of 
[04:10:30]  block out all rational stuff  I don't think at that time  you think about anybody else  I don't think that  in my case  I'm telling you my experience  my feeling at that moment  is I wasn't wanted  I wasn't needed  and to me  it's all about the pack  so when the pack  rejects you  you pretty much  don't have anything  even though  there is some  you know  success  material success  but to me  it was the pack  and so  the pack said  we no longer need you  oh wow  so it's like high school  you know  when kids are mean  to other kids 
[04:11:00]  and there's a lot of  suicide in the  high school world  because kids  isolate kids  sure  you know  so that's that feeling  of not feel  needed  wanted or loved  can I  I gotta  I'm sorry  and we can move on  to other stuff  certainly  but  when you realized  you were alive  were you mad  at that point  or were you relieved  like oh my god  I so didn't want  to do this  I woke up  in a psychiatric  hold up  for 72 hours  and at that time  I said  well I didn't die  let's go  time to move on  so that's it 
[04:11:30]  you know  if I didn't die  that was for a reason  I'm a very  you know  religious guy  and so at that time  it was my wake up call  and go back  to what I know best  I asked that  because maybe  we could help  some people today  we had the guy  that jumped off  the Golden Gate Bridge  I'll never forget it  it was a documentary  these guys set up cameras  they said they were  trying to catch  something else  the bridge it was called  right  yeah the bridge  but they caught  all these people  jumping off the  Golden Gate Bridge  and it's a known fact  people actually travel  to the Golden Gate Bridge  to end their lives  one guy survived  and we had him on the phone 
[04:12:00]  and we asked  what were you thinking  as soon as you jumped  and immediately  he said  I was thinking  oh I did not want  to just do what I just did  and he was  you know  he survived it  so  no I did want it  to do it  so I didn't feel remorse  I mean I'm all  I'm 100%  or 100%  this guy  I was not in the middle  I'm not a middle  type of guy  I just wonder  how many people  would have  said the same thing  but obviously  they can't tell  the story today  the best thing  this guy said  soon as he jumped 
[04:12:30]  he said  oh no  I did not want  to do that  oh  yeah  well  that's a different way  you know what I mean  yeah  I didn't have to  but the best thing  for people  is to make sure  they talk about it  you know  that's definitely  because you start  suppressing all those  feelings  and that's what  drives you crazy  yeah  and that's why  I help dogs  you know  most people  suppress dogs  feelings  and that's  that's why  you know  the new show  is season 9-1-1  yeah sure  it's about  helping a dog  but more important  is this time  people don't  personally don't 
[04:13:00]  call me  it's the neighbors  who call me  it's the family  members who call me  so it's an element  of whistleblower  you know  where  because most people  are in denial  or they just  don't want to  deal with it  they're offended  like hey  what are you  telling me  how to raise  my dog  they do  once I come in  because they were  not expecting me  to come with cameras  you know  to their lives  but by that time  the neighbors  are you know  petrified  or super scared  because they're  afraid of the kids  most of the time  you know  people are more  concerned about  the kids  than the dog  and so a lot  of those situations  is a dog 
[04:13:30]  attacking a child  and it's a lot  you know  I work with  redstone cases  you know  my expertise  is to save  the life  of dogs  who are misunderstood  you know  I don't think  we have a  problem with aggression  we have a problem  with the lack  of education  what do you think  the biggest mistake  people make is  when they get a dog  what's the one thing  that they do  that can  you know  probably screw  most family  most family  don't have agreement  so most family  the father  get it for the kids  but the mother  knows she  is going to end up  with the load  you know 
[04:14:00]  so there is no  agreement for them  from the beginning  so it's a little bit  of resentment  and the dog  senses that  right  and most  most family  because they  don't know  what the commitment  of a dog  is all about  they're not  committed  so then they  say well  I have a big  backyard  so the dog  ends up in the back  that's right  yeah  and a lot of times  people don't know  what makes a dog  happy  you know  everybody thinks  it's affection  affection  affection  yeah  and it's  exercise  discipline  affection  body  mind  heart  yeah  you know  what I mean  so everybody  thinks that  they're going  to buy  the happiness  of a dog  which is actually 
[04:14:30]  you don't even  have to put  any money  that's why  homeless people  have dogs  because it  doesn't require  money  right  but the homeless  walk a dog  every day  but he's always  in front  the homeless  right  my clients  they're in the back  with a flexi leash  so the dog  is 20 feet  in front of them  leading  the human  ah  now they get  the impression  that they're  the boss  and they own  whatever they're  walking  that's why  they're zigzagging  and urinating  everywhere  yeah  that's the thing 
[04:15:00]  is most people  don't know  what makes  a dog  balanced  most people  make a dog  unstable  but they do  it way  before they  get the dog  and without  thinking  really  yeah  well  Ian has a cat  that he's not  he's not  raising properly  he's not  abusing it  I don't want  to give you  that impression  maybe you could  give him a tip  I know  you mostly  work with dogs  but  this cat  has the run  of the place  which most cats  do  I let him  you know  I let him  have the run  of the place  of this  it's the worst 
[04:15:30]  behaved cat  in North America  I've been told  it's bad behavior  but the second  he does something  bad  I grab the camera  because it's hysterical  so I start  taking pictures  he encourages  good behavior  for viral videos  especially with  little dogs  most people think  that when a little  dog growls  it's cute  if you ever go  to a dog park  most dog fights  are triggered  by a little dog  little dog  yeah  because number one  they don't arrive  in their feet  they arrive  in people's arms  so they're looking  at a bigger dog  from this position 
[04:16:00]  oh my  it's like look  I'm a big guy  that's right  and I get carried  to the dog park  and the human  caters to me  and everybody  caters to me  because everybody  thinks I'm cute  you see what I mean  with a bigger dog  you keep distance  yeah  you see a rottweiler  that is not yours  you're going to  keep distance  sure  and people are going  to grab the little dog  and put it here  and the little dog  say well my human  is insecure  I'm going to protect  my human  they start growling  at the rottweiler  and the rottweiler  what  and that's when  the problems begin 
[04:16:30]  that's some logic  right there  when did you figure  out that noise  that  oh my god  you don't even  know how to do it  I don't do it  well I don't have  any animals  you know  the behavior  or the sound  librarians do that  all the time  just to create  calmness  they don't say  hey  because that creates  tension  they go  it's just to  create calmness  so the  it's just to  stop the brain  and relax the brain 
[04:17:00]  that's the whole purpose  most people  overuse sound  most people go  hey  no  no  no  no  no  hey  stop it  no  hey  every woman  I go out with  they have to learn  to do  you  you need rules  boundaries  and limitations  there you go  see it applies  to us  you know  it applies  to us  yeah  what's the  what's the scariest  dog by nature  none  the scary  the scary  situation  is when a dog  is hauled by a human 
[04:17:30]  who doesn't know  how to haul a dog  most people  haul dogs  the leash  like they wrap  their leashes  yeah wrap it around  that's really scary man  sure  yeah  the person is  hauling a dog  with tension  that intensifies  anything the dog  is feeling  so you're not scared  of any dogs  no  that's why I'm  training people  right  I'm not training dogs  I'm rehabilitating  meaning I'm restoring  them to go back  to their natural state  you know  dogs in their  country  it's skinny  but they don't  have psychological  problems  right  dog in America  are chunky  and I have a TV show  you see 
[04:18:00]  so it's not the dog  because those dogs  I mean they should be  in a worst case scenario  but they actually know  how to be around  people off leash  were you ever in a  situation where  you were in over  your head at first  no  not with a dog  with humans  yes  because humans  never with a dog  ever  no no no  with humans  humans can be stubborn  or in denial  that's challenging  right  you know  dogs are not  they're not denying  how they feel  if they're aggressive  they tell you  if they're fearful  they tell you  they're not saying  I'm okay  you know what I mean  you ask a person  they say  how you feeling 
[04:18:30]  I'm okay  but their emotion  is different  right  so the mind  is saying  it's okay  because they want  to look good  a dog doesn't  care about looking  good  a dog cares  about telling you  how he feels  he's very honest  so you walk in  there's a dog  out of control  right  and it's coming  right at you  yeah  you could get  you could get  that dog calm  before it bites you  absolutely  I'm helping right now  police officers  with that  because a lot of  a lot of times  police officers  are told to shoot  oh yeah  and so one of the  one of the works  that I'm doing right now 
[04:19:00]  for police officers  is to learn to read a dog  right  not because the dog  is coming after you  he wants to bite you  that's not the truth  that's not  that's not true  most dogs are coming  from a territory perspective  they're just charging  right  they're pouncing the floor  so what  what's one tip  you could give people  you got the wild dog  we'll call it wild  they're domesticated  you know  you can't use the word  wild  I know  it's domesticated  I probably shouldn't say that  but dogs coming at you  yeah  what's one tip  you stay calm  just try to stay chill  you stay calm  you stay  you control your ground 
[04:19:30]  you stay calm  you square them out  and don't move  that's it  you stay calm  oh man  look at this  stay calm  that's hard to do  oh damn  that's fine  here's a dog  you gotta clean  you gotta clean  here's mine  very good  but your mouth is tense  your mouth is tense  oh  oh  oh that was tense  so what are you doing  look look  yeah  look at this  that's right  this could work with humans too  I like this  that's right  you guys do it all the time  the street is about that  it's about energy  yeah 
[04:20:00]  if you walk insecure  bam  people can read that  that's right  they can smell that  if you walk insecure  they give you space  gotta loosen that mouth a little bit  I just learned something today  now most people  when they see a dog coming  they do this  sure  as soon as you do that  you become a squirrel  right  oh man  you're a gigantic squirrel  it's so hard to not  do that though  but that goes  yeah  it goes against  your natural response  it goes against everything  you're thinking in your head  no  it's your condition  yeah  your condition  it's not natural  there was a giant  bull mast of loose  this week  like this week in New Jersey 
[04:20:30]  it was like  it's in the paper today  and it killed a kid  it was like one of those  like you know  giant dogs  that got out of the  so like what do you do  if there's a rampaging  giant dog  I mean how do you sit there  if you just sit there  calmly and look at it  isn't he still gonna jump on you  not to relax  if you're too passive  you're also a target  you know  I'm saying  you can't slump  I'm saying you gotta be calm  and assertive  not just calm  yeah you're a statue  there's confidence  with your stance there  if you calm  you're passive  you're passive  you're a target  gotcha  so what do you got  I don't understand  you can't look too relaxed  you can't look too aggressive 
[04:21:00]  you gotta be balanced  oh boy  you gotta be balanced  that's a tough one  what excite girls  is a calm assertive guy  what about if you wet your pants  you're toast dude  you're toast dude  you're toast dude  you're a bone now  would that work with bears  and  that's what they tell you  right  I never done it with a bear  but that's what I told you  you know  and at G-O-I  we have a guy  named Casey  and he works with a bear  and so  that's what  that's the energy  that he practiced  and when I help him  with a dog  it's just like a bear 
[04:21:30]  it's just like a bear  But, you know, Mother Nature is, when it comes to energy, they're all the same.  You know, some people are afraid of ducks.  Some people are afraid of goose.  Some people are afraid of chickens.  Who's afraid of a duck?  They will attack you.  Turkeys will go after you.  Yeah, but I'll kick the shit out of a turkey.  Turkeys are vicious.  It's the energy.  I'm sorry.  It's the energy.  I don't want to use those words.  No, no, you can't, but it's not.  But you also have to understand that you have to know why they react that way.  There is no knowledge behind instincts. 
[04:22:00]  There's all reaction.  So they're not attacking a white person, a black person, a white, a Mexican person.  They're just attacking energy.  You see, they're not racist.  They're crankier in November.  Have you noticed that?  There's a little bit.  Why are rabbits so nervous all the time?  Because they're prey animal.  They're prey animal.  Horses are the same.  If you move to a horse too excited, you're going to spook him.  Yeah, if you move too excited to a dog, he's going to come after you.  Hi, baby!  If you do that, a dog is going to come after you and jump. 
[04:22:30]  If you do that to a horse, he's going to get really nervous.  You have to understand the difference between prey and predator.  Dogs are predatorial.  Therefore, they're going to move forward.  Right.  So if your energy is off, they're going to move forward.  Right.  If your energy is off with horse, they're going to move away.  And a rabbit just thinks it's food all the time.  All the time.  It's like, oh, I'm food.  Oh, my God.  Everybody wants me.  Run.  Yeah.  Run.  They're going to wear me.  They're going to be pounding all the time.  A little nervous idiots. 
[04:23:00]  A little nervous idiots.  A little round duties all over the place on the sofa.  Just settle down.  You can't go to yourself.  You can't go a minute without letting a duty loose.  No, they can't.  What about a housebreaking dog like that?  Some people have difficulty doing that.  Housebreaking means structure, means discipline.  So when a dog is not doing the whole housebreaking thing, it's because the human is not consistent  with the rules.  Feeding should be a rule.  Like what time?  Because after the dog eats, five minutes to 30 minutes, that's when they have the bowel  movement. 
[04:23:30]  So now that you know, that's the biological.  Right.  It is nothing outside that.  But there are people that just dump a bunch of food and leave it there.  It's like a cat, right?  Right.  Or like a bird.  A free feeding doesn't allow you to have structure.  Right.  You know?  So most of the time, people don't know or they're lazy, you know?  Yeah.  And so they don't want to create a structure.  So in order for you to have a housebreaking, a perfect housebreaking behavior from a dog,  you need two weeks of investment.  After that, the dog knows the routine.  Because you're creating a pattern.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  So he'll know, like, all right, they're going to take me out so I can go at a certain 
[04:24:00]  time.  Or they're going to tell me where to use the bathroom.  Right, right.  You know, some people use newspapers, some people use wiggly pads, whatever.  Whatever it is, it's just you're just showing a pattern.  Remember, when you get a dog, he doesn't know where he lives.  So it's a moment of adjustment.  He gets nervous.  He gets fearful.  He gets unsure.  He's disoriented.  So when the brain is in that state, they're going to use the bathroom more often.  Right.  Because, you know, the nerves create easy bowel movement.  That's what Jimmy did the first time he came out of my house. 
[04:24:30]  That's right.  Just in the bathroom all the time.  I just ran in a circle and I made it on the kitchen floor.  Like a rabbit.  He has the energy of a rabbit.  You should train two-year-olds for parents.  Two years old?  Yeah, I think there's a lot of money to be made there.  They're terrible twos.  It's easier.  No, but it's easier.  The thing, they're terrible because they're bored.  They're bored?  Yeah, once you encourage them to do certain things, they're engaged.  Right.  Yeah, once you get them tired.  That's just not terrible about a kid that is tired.  Right.  It's just most kids are bored, right? 
[04:25:00]  And so they say, well, he has a problem.  Well, the problem is he doesn't have nothing to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So he's acting out.  Yeah, like kids in the farm.  There is no terrible kids in the farm because they're going to take them to the chickens.  They're too busy.  Tell them to pick up this thing.  So they have a job.  Interesting.  I want to help two people out quickly.  We got Alvin in the Bronx.  Alvin, we got Cesar Millan in studio.  His new show is Cesar 911 on Nachio Wild.  What do you got today?  Hey.  All right.  Put your head on.  Thank you.  Quick question, man.  My dog is house trained. 
[04:25:30]  We have a wooly pad set up for him.  But for some reason, he always manages to pick up his leg on our couch.  We've used products.  We recently bought anti-icky poo.  Doesn't work for shit.  We've wrapped our couch with some sort of plastic layer.  He still manages to pick up his leg every now and then.  What do you think it could be and what can I do to fix this?  Okay.  Number one, simple question.  Is he neutered?  He's not, no.  All right.  There you go.  We've actually been skeptical because when he was younger, he had like a pneumonia. 
[04:26:00]  So the doctor recommended not to put him under, but we're probably going to go that route this summer.  That's right.  But that's a marking.  You know, because they use the bathroom for two things.  One, they need to empty the bladder.  And the other one is to mark.  Also, you have to work a little bit more in telling him what to do.  Most dogs, when the human doesn't really do a lot of activities like obedience, where the human is telling the dog what to do, the dog tells the human what to do. 
[04:26:30]  That's how they end up becoming more dominant.  Like if a dog tells you, open the door, let's go for a walk, feed me.  And then the dog is in control of the activities.  I'm not saying not to do it.  I'm just telling you, you control the activities.  And that also lowers the need for the dog to remind people who owns the house.  So it can be behavior.  It can be, you know, biology.  One more random question.  You were talking about Mexicans and blacks and Hispanics and everything.  We have a theory that our dog is racist because whenever he sees a black person, he just starts yapping at them.  I swear to God, we got two other people on the line. 
[04:27:00]  I know the answer to that one.  They're picking up the energy of the people.  Ah.  Of their owners.  There are two other people on the line with the same question.  Look, Mike Westchester, my dog flips out on black people every time.  Is it possible?  She is racist.  And he writes, honestly, he's not trying to, you know, come up with a joke.  No, no.  It's a very common question, by the way.  But dogs don't born racist.  You know, like kids don't born racist.  So they learn it somewhere.  Some people feel nervous and tense and unsure.  And the dog related to that moment. 
[04:27:30]  You know what I mean?  Obviously, the owner is racist.  And the dog is picking up on that.  The owner, she might feel uncomfortable with the color.  And it's just the dog picking up on that.  You know, it's like, yeah.  Yeah, I've never seen a dog lock its doors quickly when someone walks by.  Let's talk about cats.  Cats are a perfect example.  Cats don't care if there's a pit bull, a rottweiler, a German shepherd.  They don't care about breed.  What the cat actually acknowledges is the energy or the intention of that dog towards them.  You see?  So, you know, cats, which is cats and dogs, you know, one of the most common themes in America. 
[04:28:00]  Oh, you guys like cats and dogs.  The thing is, cats are not, they don't care if it's a rottweiler or a German shepherd.  What they care is about how the dog feels towards the cat.  Yeah, yeah.  If the dog is relaxed, that's how the cat is going to behave.  But if the intention of the dog is to chase him, and then the cat is going to do a fight, fly to avoid it.  The cat will do that five whacks to the nose in a split second.  That's right.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[04:28:30]  Cats, they don't have this forward.  No, it goes sideways.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  They go puff up.  Their tail gets all puffed up.  That's showing the assertiveness.  They claim in their territory.  Yeah.  Cats are badass.  I've seen cats chase dogs away.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  So my point is the animals among each other are not racist because they don't look at the outside.  They look at the inside.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So that's what we've got to learn.  Right.  You know what I mean?  That's a better example for people.  Okay, so maybe I am feeling uncomfortable around certain people. 
[04:29:00]  And you're the American dream.  I am?  Yeah, you got over here.  I jump, run, do the whole obstacle course.  You jumped and you were 21.  Did you really run?  How did it go down?  You got to run, you got to swim, you got to grow up.  Like a Navy SEAL.  You came over when you were 21, right?  I came over when I was 21.  So take us through that really fast.  You decide, all right, this is the day I'm going for it, right?  Did you do your research ahead of time?  No, no, no.  Research is not a word in Mexico. 
[04:29:30]  You just do it.  Just do it.  That's a lot of Mexico done research, you know?  But you didn't research.  We just do it.  You didn't research it out yourself.  Like I think over here might be it.  No, no, no.  We don't have a pretty good shot.  No, no.  What happened is when I was 13, I told my mom,  Mom, you think I can be the best dog trainer in the world?  She turned around and said, you can do whatever you want.  She didn't know what that was because nobody in Mexico want to be a dog trainer, right?  And so when I was 21, well, before that, I started watching Lassie and Ring Tintin.  And that's when I said, man, those guys are awesome.  I got to go to where Americans are, learn from them, and come back so I can open my dog training facility in Mexico. 
[04:30:00]  But when I crossed the border, I realized that nobody knew how to walk a dog.  Oh, wow.  You know, that's what I saw people being dragged by dogs and holding trees, you know, so they can pass.  So another person can pass with a dog, you know.  So that's when I saw the disconnection.  You know, I thought, well, nobody's watching Lassie and Ring Tintin.  It's like me, you know.  How did you get over the wall or did you swim?  Like what was the process?  It took two weeks, by the way.  It took two weeks.  Two weeks.  It's not as easy as it sounds, you know. 
[04:30:30]  And by that, you get to see a lot of people, you know, dying.  You get to see people dying.  You saw people dying trying to do the same thing.  When I jumped, it was the time where it was a big, you know, heavy rain happening in Tijuana.  So all the occurring that happens there is pregnant women, it's older people, it's kids, it's people with the kids on their shoulders.  I mean, it's a sacrifice.  That's right.  It's a sacrifice.  It's not an easy thing to do.  And most people are not young, you know. 
[04:31:00]  You know, everybody's coming here for the opportunity.  And the coyote guy is not like, okay, guys, we got to, you know, work out and we got to talk about this thing.  They don't give you like a, you know, list to follow.  You just go with the flow.  Yeah.  So you get to see people just taking away by the current.  What did you do when you first got over the border?  What was like the first place you went to?  He was homeless for a few months.  Well, you know, once I finally passed, the coyote guy.  Did you pass over a wall?  Did you swim? 
[04:31:30]  I did all of them.  Oh, you really did all of them?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's two weeks.  Right.  Your job is how can you get in.  Okay.  I understand I disrespected, but now I pay good taxes.  So you want me here and I create jobs and stuff.  So you want me here.  That was a long time ago.  That was a long time.  I mean, I understand, you know.  I pay my debt to society.  A lot.  This whole interview is a sting operation.  I'm okay.  You want me here.  Especially people with dogs. 
[04:32:00]  So after that, you know, the coyote guy pay a taxi guy, which is unusual that a coyote  actually helps you.  Coyote is the guy, the Mexican guy?  No, coyote is the guy that helps you cross the border.  I don't know what they do.  And then you're indebted to them for a really long time.  No, no.  You don't know them.  You don't know them.  I've heard you're indebted to some of these guys for a long time.  Oh, that's when you hire them in your village in Mexico.  No, no, no.  I hire him on the border.  And that was it?  Yeah, that was it.  What have you done?  That's it.  I'm glad he doesn't remember me. 
[04:32:30]  Hey, dude, I want to shout you a hug a box.  You can pay me more now.  I think you can afford it.  Yeah, so after that, they sent me to San Diego downtown.  Then I went on their freeway.  So I stayed on their freeway for two months.  Wow.  Yeah.  Were you afraid of constantly every time a cop drove by that you were going to be arrested and deported?  Yes, yes, of course.  You're always running away.  You're always running away.  And the good thing about America is you can live with a dollar a day.  7-11 at a.m. p.m.  I buy two hot dogs for 99 cents.  So you don't have to make a lot of money.  You just put a lot of tomatoes and onions. 
[04:33:00]  And here you guys have the refill.  I mean, you buy it once and you just go back and you refill and you can sell them outside.  Yeah.  I mean, I started my entrepreneurial work right away.  And then you just started walking dogs, right?  Yeah, that's when I...  Because there's two borders you have to pass.  San Clemente, San Diego, and then San Clemente.  And then you can only do that on a bus.  So that's when I saved some money by grooming dogs in San Diego.  Then after that, I also buy my first clothes.  Wow. 
[04:33:30]  That's when Miller Opus was open.  You remember Miller Opus?  What year was this?  Oh, man.  That was 1991.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That was a while ago.  I've been in America 23 years.  Longer than I've been in Mexico.  Wow.  I left when I was 21.  Yeah.  So 20 years ago.  Well, you know, there's a lot of opportunities here.  You know, me as an immigrant, the only thing you see is opportunities.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  The only thing you need is a green card.  Yeah, yeah.  But I created my own job.  You know, I rehabilitate dogs and train people. 
[04:34:00]  I opened a dog psychology center in South Central.  Most people would tell me, see, are you crazy?  You're going to open a business in South Central?  This is where the gangs are.  I say, you guys see it as South Central.  I see it as America.  I'm doing a business in America.  Yeah, a lot of Americans.  I mean, they all have dogs.  Those gang members all have fucking pit bulls.  All of them do.  I know, but they don't pay you, so you've got to skip them.  They're saying he's got to go.  That's not from us, by the way.  Well, thank you, Al.  Sometimes it is from us.  Season 9-1-1, not deal wild.  Thanks.  March 7.

[04:39:00]  No, you got a dead man here.  Not yet.  I mean, that's why we're here.  But not so great at everything else.  You still live with your parents.  No.  No.  They live upstairs.  I live downstairs.  It's a whole separate floor.  Sirens, a new original series.  Premieres this Thursday at 10, 9 central on USA Network.  Comedy's welcome.  Unfortunately, the O.P. and Anthony show is over. 
[04:39:30]  Fortunately, we have a hard time letting go.  The stories behind the stories.  Behind the stories.  The backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW-NOW.  Now.  Now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  Post Show.  With Sam Roberts.  Roberts. 
[04:40:00]  Here it is.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  Live here on the O.P. and Anthony channel.  I told you today would be a big show.  Didn't I tell you that?  Of course I told you that.  Two big guests.  Of course, Brian Green was in here.  Blowing all our minds.  I don't know.  I give credit to O.P. and Anthony.  Because I feel like the same thing.  If I was interviewing him.  The same thing would happen to me. 
[04:40:30]  That happened to me in physics class.  I mean, he was far more engaging than any physics teacher I ever had.  But, Roland, do you kind of just.  Kind of lose focus when he starts talking about that stuff?  You know, the string theory.  I'm like, what?  Yeah, like you go.  And he said the rip.  If the rip's not there.  But the rip's there.  Be careful of the black holes.  I'm like, what's going on, man?  I don't know what happens.  Because you go, okay.  I'm interested in the question.  And you go, okay.  I'm going to listen.  You go in focused.  I'm going to listen to this answer.  Because I really want to know what's going on. 
[04:41:00]  And then as he starts talking, like halfway into the second sentence, you go, oh my God.  My brain just turned off.  What happened?  Yeah.  The only thing I ever understand about the rip is when Han Solo goes to Chewie.  Hit it, Chewie.  And he goes.  Yeah, I don't think that has anything to do with space ripping.  Yeah, because he goes through hyperspace.  That's just light speed.  But he goes through space.  Plus, that is Star Wars, the film.  That's not a textbook for space travel.  We don't know.  No, we're positive that George Lucas just made that up.  We have two more physicists coming in, so why don't I ask? 
[04:41:30]  When?  Thursday, Friday.  This week, two more physicists.  So who will be joining the Opie and Anthony show this week?  The other grass, Tyson.  Oh, wow.  He's very good.  And Michu Kaku.  Two of our favorite physicists.  Yes.  My goodness, my goodness.  Wow.  So who's going to be on the phones then?  Oh, we're getting a pen.  Sal, do we have a lot of the day?  Yeah, you've got to give me one second.  It's complete anarchy around here.  Complete anarchy. 
[04:42:00]  Wow.  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number to call.  Yeah.  I need Cesar Millan back in here.  I don't know.  Who gets trained?  What does he do?  He trains people, but he rehabilitates dogs.  Yeah.  I think everybody around here needs a good rehabilitation.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah.  You included, Roland.  Oh, I know that.  He's so funny.  The way Cesar Millan talks about, you have to be calm around the dog.  You know, you just have to be calm.  And yet, maybe it's different rules for cats. 
[04:42:30]  Cats are assholes.  Yeah.  I'll sit there with my cat and go, Bruiser Brody, we're not going to eat right now.  And he'll go, oh, no problem.  Just dig his claws in and bite.  Yeah.  The last time you told him, Bruiser, leave him alone.  He'll alert you to you.  So your cat jumped behind me and handed me in the eye with his head.  Right.  Like, nah, I don't think I'm going to do that.  Maybe it's different with dogs.  All right.  Sal, are we ready?  We got it.  He's good. 
[04:43:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Most people over you sound.  Most people go, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, stop it.  No.  Hey.  Every woman I go out with.  That is good.  Cesar Millan, I don't want to say surprisingly good guest, but it was right along the lines  of every time they have any fears about these guests before they come in. 
[04:43:30]  Obi was talking about Cesar Millan earlier in the show, and look what happened.  He's open.  Yeah.  I mean, Obi started by talking about the suicide attempt.  Yeah, and he talked about my people swimming, jumping, running.  He talked about it all.  He was a great, great guest.  E-Rock, did you hear that the WWE is going to be at Madison Square Garden on Saturday?  I did.  You going?  I don't know if I'm going.  Well, I will tell you this.  Some lucky caller's going.  If you want to go to WWE at Madison Square Garden, call up the after show, 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[04:44:00]  You have to be local to the area, of course.  Post show, dude.  What did I say?  Call up the after show.  That's not true.  Can I call in and win?  No.  No.  But if you want to go and you're in the New York area, call the post show now, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  I'm calling to win the tickets.  No, you can't win the tickets.  Well, people get to see the brand new garden.  It's already totally remodeled.  Yeah, you get to go.  You get to make a night of it.  Sal.  Yes, Sam? 
[04:44:30]  Give me your favorite clip of the day.  Here we go.  Just slow down, because I think you're talking and your phone is dropping out.  Okay, Jimmy.  Jimmy, right.  Thank you.  I'll slow it down.  Okay.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  I don't want to make a night.  No problem.  Front page of the page.  Go ahead.  Looking like he's never seen it.  We heard you!  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Don't say no, you didn't.  That was like a classic one.  The buildup on that was so good.  Oh, dude.  I love when you hear Jimmy clearing his throat right before. 
[04:45:00]  It's just, it's fucking classic.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially because, and we'll play the whole clip probably tomorrow on the pre-show.  And you'll hear it, I mean, if you haven't heard any of these clips, that happened earlier  in the show, so if you're on the West Coast or whatever, replay starts right after the  post-show.  But, I mean, yeah, that guy was like, all right.  He kind of started to get wind of it.  And he goes, you know what, I'm just going to punch out.  But then he didn't hang up.  And I think he believed once again that Obi and Anthony really didn't hear him.  And then what happened?  Humiliated. 
[04:45:30]  Let's see.  Neil in Yonkers.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Not too much.  Yourself?  Not too much.  You WWE fan?  Absolutely.  Who's your favorite wrestler?  I'm going to go with CM Punk.  Unfortunately, he's not with them anymore.  All right.  It sounds like you know your shit.  Well, Neil, I'm going to put you on hold.  Line two is going to see WWE at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.  Remember, for the latest happenings in WWE or to see when WWE will be in your area, visit 
[04:46:00]  WWE.com forward slash events for tour dates.  Congratulations, Neil.  Thank you very much.  All right.  All right.  Stay on hold.  Pick up line two in there and get all his information.  Got it.  Do you have, uh...  Does anybody in there have Travis's clip of the day?  I want to hear what he liked.  Uh, we don't have Travis's right now.  We have Eric's.  All right.  Give me Eric's.  Um...  Yeah, Brian Greene is a string theory guy.  All right.  So does he do, like, a show? 
[04:46:30]  He's done a bunch of books.  He does TV appearances all the time.  He just did a TED Talk.  TED Talk?  That's right!  No.  No, no, no.  That's TED Talk.  TED String Emporium for those with theories!  What is it with you and Norton characters?  I love TED.  You fucking love TED, huh?  Yeah.  Now, TED Sheckler is one of Jim's first characters.  Uh, one of the early ones, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, because I remember having this conversation with you. 
[04:47:00]  Because you'd be like...  Because you'd come to me every day and say,  here's what I pull for worst of.  And we had this catalog where any time Jim opened his mouth  and that voice came out of it, you were like,  yeah, I isolated the, uh, 15 seconds of TED Sheckler today.  And I'd go, Eric, why?  What are you doing?  It's for my own iPod.  Right.  No, but that's a good idea.  You just love it.  TED's great.  We haven't seen...  So, I feel like his first...  It was Frank the Frowner.  Right.  Morphed into TED Sheckler. 
[04:47:30]  It was Liddy.  Right, but I want to...  I'm trying to follow the chain of...  Yeah, Frank the Frowner became TED.  Became TED.  Right.  And then...  But...  Chip came after TED.  Do you feel like there's a little bit of TED in Chip?  Uh...  Like when Chip gets mad?  Or are they two...  Are they really two separate characters?  I think it's two separate.  Ted's sort of a space case and not aware of things around him.  Uh, Chip is aware, but purposely does hacky, awful things.  I... 
[04:48:00]  I...  I can't believe that we are discussing this as if it's a real thing.  Right.  I get it.  It's...  It's insanity.  Sal.  Yes, Sam.  We talked about, uh, gentrification today with Spike Lee.  Yeah.  You are the representative for gentrified New York and Brooklyn here at the O.B. and Anthony  Show, correct?  Right.  I mean, technically, Roland, you live in Brooklyn now, too, right?  Yeah.  But I believe you bring property values down, correct?  I bring them.  I do.  Yeah.  Roland walks around in, like, sweatpants and shitty old T-shirts all day. 
[04:48:30]  Sal, you are the face of gentrified Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I think I, you know, I wouldn't have gone there even ten years ago.  Ten years ago, where I live, Williamsburg is pretty rough still, actually.  Even Williamsburg, huh?  Yeah.  Because Williamsburg was the first...  Because Brooklyn is divided into many parts.  Brooklyn is huge.  Brooklyn, the borough, is a...  Brooklyn is a part of New York City.  But it's one of the biggest areas of land, you know, in terms of cities in the States.  I mean, it's, like, bigger than...  It's, like, the size of Pittsburgh or something. 
[04:49:00]  Yeah.  Because over the weekend, Sam, I went to the hipster brunch place of all hipster brunch places.  So now, when you go to Williamsburg, because, you know, Brooklyn was known as  white people don't go there.  Now, when you go to Williamsburg specifically, is there...  Are there black people at all?  Yeah.  They're black hipsters, you know?  But they're black hipsters.  Right.  They're not, like, scary black people.  Yeah, no.  These guys, like, work and, you know, they have legitimate jobs.  So how did you feel about Spike Lee coming out and talking about how bad gentrification  was?  Do you feel, Sal, have you raped a culture? 
[04:49:30]  No.  Like the guy said, it's better for the place because where Spike Lee grew up, I'm pretty  sure it was, like, Bed-Stuy.  I think he's pretty sure he grew up in Bed-Stuy.  Do or die.  Yeah, do or die.  And, you know, it's...  He moved out of there because he doesn't want to live in shit either.  Right.  That's true.  So he's a fucking hypocrite.  But...  And I love Spike Lee, but he's a hypocrite.  But it's better for the place because...  It's not better for the people because those people don't live there anymore.  Right.  Exactly.  When you say they cleaned up the place, you mean they made all the poor people leave  because they couldn't afford their places anymore, correct?  No.  No.  They still live there and they're, you know, they're rent stabilized and stuff like that. 
[04:50:00]  They're completely safe there.  But for other people who are, like, young generations...  How come you don't see them?  Because they come out late at night, Sam.  They don't wake up and go to work.  Well, they can't go anyplace to eat.  I mean, how much are you paying for brunch over there?  First of all, there was a time where you wouldn't go to Brooklyn and claim a meal called brunch  existed.  No, but brunch is a fucking thing and a half.  It's all cash brunch.  Why is it all cash?  No credit cards.  What is that? 
[04:50:30]  No, like in some places, like the hipster brunch place, the best ones are, like, it says  catch only.  Well, that would make...  That would...  I mean, I would think the people who were there before gentrification would probably  swing that okay.  A lot of them dealt in cash businesses.  I don't know.  It's very expensive, though.  But how much is a brunch?  I think there was about five of us the other day at brunch.  It's probably close to 200 bucks.  Jesus Christ.  No drinks or anything.  It was just...  That's why...  And that's why you don't see...  For eggs.  For eggs and bacon.  Right.  $200 worth of eggs and bacon. 
[04:51:00]  Yeah.  $200 worth of chicken embryos and swine.  Was it even a buffet?  No.  Was it even...  What kind of...  Who spent 200 bucks on a fucking buffet, you Rob?  Come on, man.  That's what brunch is.  You love a buffet?  You gotta.  Get out of here, dude.  Go to the chart house in Weehawken.  Great.  No, go to egg in Brooklyn.  Oh, okay.  So that's why you don't see any of the people...  I mean, yes, they are rent-stabilized, and so they can, I guess, stay where they're living.  But they can't enjoy the town at all, because they can't afford anything. 
[04:51:30]  No, no, no.  They still stick to their normal places, but the indie bars that don't have names on the front,  the hipsters go.  But don't you think that their quote-unquote normal places are all being overrun?  Like, they're all getting closed down.  To an extent.  Like, I think young hipsters, and I keep on saying, like, if it's not me, but they enjoy  that atmosphere.  They enjoy the, you know, the barber shops, the chicken shops.  When you go order Chinese food, it's behind bulletproof glass still.  You know, they like that shit.  They like that.  They like it.  Yeah, but the Chinese, the people running those places know that there's a bunch of 
[04:52:00]  shitty white kids that want to feel dangerous going in there.  Absolutely.  And so they're, but they're raising their prices.  Absolutely, yeah.  Which means that the people who require the bulletproof glass can't buy the food there  anymore.  Yes, yes.  So, even though they all have rent-stabilized apartments, they can no longer be a part of  their community, correct?  To a degree, yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Now, did I, was I more eloquent than Spike Lee in my, uh, in my argument? 
[04:52:30]  Right.  I mean, yeah, I completely agree because he, these motherfucking Christopher Columbus  can't, like, yeah, I mean, he, he was, he was always an advocate person of staying  in your community and staying there.  And what he did was he just fucking upped and left because he couldn't afford Chinese  food.  It's like, dude, you can afford it, you know, and he's, he's full of shit, whatever.  Right.  He could afford to shop in the newly expensive Chinese restaurants.  And when he was living in, in, uh, Bed-Stuy, I'm pretty sure it was, correct me if I'm  wrong, but on his, on his block, it was all like, it was guys like Chris Rock. 
[04:53:00]  It wasn't, it wasn't a real Bed-Stuy block.  It was a fuck, it was a really nice block.  It was.  Yeah.  Brownstone, you know, $8 million brownstones.  You think he lived in an $8 million brownstone?  Absolutely.  Oh, you mean when he was rich?  When?  Not growing up.  No, not when he was growing up, but like now.  Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.  He didn't stay at the same house that he stayed at.  Of course not.  That's insanity.  Why would you?  You gotta hook it up a little bit, you know?  I think that he, he, he goes more to the point of, you know, once you outprice the 
[04:53:30]  people who live in these rent controlled apartments that used to live everywhere in the neighborhood,  they can't really live in their neighborhood anymore, right?  Right, yeah, and now this, now he moves to like, I think he moved to New Jersey a couple  years ago, so now he's technically doing the same bullshit moving into a, an upper, upper  high-end neighborhood, and he's driving the price up even further.  Oh, Spike Lee lives here, you know?  So he's doing the exact same bullshit.  Yeah, but did he move into a high-end, did he move into a neighborhood that used to be  low-end and is now high-end, or was it a pre-established high-end neighborhood?  It was pre-established high-end, but therefore he's bringing the property value higher. 
[04:54:00]  So why don't you, Sal, stick to your little high-end neighborhoods and stop chasing the  Brooklynites out of Brooklyn?  Yeah, Sal.  I'm sorry, dude.  But at least I'm a fucking native New Yorker.  There's a lot of people in Brooklyn who don't even, who are not even born here.  You're not a native New Yorker.  You're from Staten Island.  That's New York City, bro.  It's not.  Yes, it is.  Staten Island's worse than Jersey.  All right, you're right.  All right.  I think we're out of time.  E-Rock, is Roland really organizing food to celebrate your birthday tomorrow? 
[04:54:30]  Apparently so.  He keeps asking me my opinions on different selections.  I said, I'm not eating that.  Your birthday was on Sunday.  Right.  Are you still maintaining?  I'm still maintaining.  Did you hear us laughing at your clip on the pre-show?  No, I didn't.  I was dealing with other shows.  You, the one morning show specifically, you on Friday saying, yes, I've started to lose  weight and I'm maintaining now.  Yes.  Like, you're on a diet.  Yes.  And as long as you're not gaining weight, you're satisfied with your results.  I jumped right to the maintain stage.  Who gains weight on a diet? 
[04:55:00]  Well, apparently Roland, he went up five.  He did go up five.  Celebratory.  And then yesterday, he said, I can't even get into Roland.  First of all, he spells celebratory the same way he says it.  Yeah.  No R.  Celebratory.  So?  Yeah, like, oh, you guys.  I do like that.  Roland gets a little upset about it, but I was complimenting the fact that you're all  American and you're going, no, I'm happy maintaining.  Like, I'm satisfied.  Sam, I am what I am.  Good for you, Eric.  Good for you.
