<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic performance by Judah Friedlander, the "world champion" hat-wearing comedian, who discussed his merchandise, acting career (including an on-set mishap during *Studio 60*), and his marathon training (or lack thereof).  Fellow guest Vinny, described as small but confrontational, shared stories about his farm and his obsession with *Little People, Big World*.  The hosts interspersed this with humorous John Sterling home run call snippets. The segment was liberally laced with offensive language.

Next, the show welcomed Dennis Leary and his band.  Leary engaged in extended, foul-mouthed banter with Opie and Anthony, focusing particularly on the word "cunt" and its societal implications compared to other taboo terms.  He recounted stories from touring with Ozzy Osbourne in Japan, including groupie encounters and a tale of accidentally waking Geezer Butler.  Leary's band performed live and studio versions of songs like "Merry Fucking Christmas" and another described as a "fuck you" song.  Leary repeatedly called Opie and Anthony "whores," criticizing their perceived ease of work.  He also shared a listener's story about sniffing a homeless woman's buttocks for money, fueling further vulgar discussion.

The following segment covered a wide range of topics, including the smell of a homeless prostitute, a debate over Howard Stern's claim of inventing acoustic radio performances, Dennis Leary's *Rescue Me* (including a humorous anecdote about a call with his mother after a St. Patrick's Day incident), Leary's dislike of certain bands (The Who, Genesis, Yes), Gary Glitter's arrest, and a caller's complaint about the show's firefighter portrayal.  The show featured listener calls and a bit involving a cab driver, "Big A," being interviewed uncomfortably close to a female interviewer.  Jimmy Fallon joined the show, promoting his *Saturday Night Live* work and a charity song, "Car Wash for Peace."  The segment was rife with vulgar jokes about sex, bodily functions, and various ethnic groups.

A phone call with Louis C.K. followed, discussing his dog's death (hit by a truck while chasing a deer at his ex-wife's urging), the emotional experience of putting the dog in the oven, and subsequent crying.  The conversation delved into listeners' pet death experiences, including graphic details, and then into funerals and the often-inappropriate behavior of mourners.  Louis C.K. shared anecdotes about his children's reactions and interactions with their teacher.  This was followed by a rambling, intoxicated, and profane hard rock/heavy metal performance by Jim Brewer via phone, filled with homophobic slurs and sexual references.  The hosts provided crude commentary. Finally, Rich Vos and his wife, Bonnie McCarlin, joined, discussing Vos's struggles to quit smoking, with much teasing from the hosts and Bonnie.  The conversation included his attempts at justification, suggested quitting methods (hypnosis, laser surgery), past attempts, his relationship with Bonnie, their comedic partnership, and past substance abuse.


The next segment focused heavily on Rich Voss's smoking habit and failed quit attempts.  Studio guest Colin Quinn heavily insulted and berated Voss.  Anecdotes about past “What the Hell Is That?” segments featuring studio doctors examining audience members (one with a concerning mouth lump potentially linked to smoking) were discussed.  Voss's conspiracy theories, particularly about the Pentagon on 9/11, were criticized at length.  The conversation touched on his marriage, Bonnie's alleged tarot card reading, his failed attempts at quitting (hypnotherapy, "the Mad Russian"), and listener calls about quitting smoking.  The hosts pushed Voss to throw away his cigarettes. A caller discussed their father-in-law's jaw cancer possibly linked to smoking.  A comedic bit involving a recording of Anthony's brother's Journey tribute band was included.  The segment ended with more ribbing of Voss and promotion of his website and MySpace page.

A basketball game brawl sparked a discussion about sexual acts, the differences between New York and Los Angeles comedians, and a vulgar conversation about weight and body image.  Ralphie May joined Opie and Anthony in studio, followed by three women from Ziggy's radio store in Brooklyn, after a caller, Jason, requested someone to "wow" the hosts.  This resulted in extensive, sexually suggestive commentary about the women's appearances.  A significant portion featured listener-submitted remixes of a Bob Kelly knee injury recording, incorporating humorous and profane sound effects and dialogue.  "Master Poe," a security guard, demonstrated unusual towel-based fighting techniques.  The segment concluded with further commentary on the women and the ensuing chaos.

The show concluded with Bob Kelly as a guest, filling in for Jim Norton, discussing his re-injured knee (initially injured during a Vegas performance).  His repeated cries of "I broke my knee, man!" and the resulting remixes were discussed.  Kelly detailed his experiences with Vicodin and other pain medication, and humorous anecdotes from a comedy tour with dangerous activities (resulting in cracked ribs, rolled ATVs, and paintball/rock climbing injuries).  The hosts used homophobic slurs and other offensive language.  A new intern, Harry T ("Harry Taliban"), who created some of the remixes, was introduced, discussing his previous employment at a more lax radio station.  The segment ended with promotion of Kelly’s website and the Opie and Anthony show.

[00:15:00]  Against traffic  Actually  Because it was  Columbus Avenue  And he said  You know what  This is safer  Than staying on the  Sidewalk with these animals  That are bothering me  Faster  Faster  Yeah  He should have just  Started running  On the hoods of the cars  At the dance scene  In fame  You know  I do the same thing  I have to walk  Against traffic too  Because so many people  Want to buy my  So many people  Want to buy my hat  Yeah  You walk into traffic  On purpose  So they can read it  And they go  Where do I get that  And you say your name  I'm selling two hats  A year now  So I gotta walk  In traffic too

[00:27:00]  It's like being home  With my parents  In an Irish house  Cunt is an adverb  An adjective  A verb  A noun  I like how you  Subtly  As far as you could push it  Put it in to rescue me  I believe it was twunt  Yeah  It was the word  We couldn't say cunt  Of course not  But we said everything except  Everything  That's a great word  Twunt  Which is a great way around it  Who doesn't know what it means  Yeah well I mean  It means you know  Whatever you want to mean 
[00:27:30]  You guys can say shit on there right?  You can say everything except  Two words  Cunt and fuck  And fuck  Anything else goes  Anything else goes  Ass, asshole  Why are you allowed to say shit?  That seems to be in the same category  No  Because in this country  You know what?  Fuck we all know  It's kind of like  Hey hey  If we let fuck in  It goes crazy  Right  And cunt  Even if they said  Fuck is allowed  And motherfucker  They would say  No you can't say cunt  Because too many women get upset  And we don't want to go home  To our wives and our moms 
[00:28:00]  Yeah  Okay  That is the N word  But why is cunt  Not an acceptable word?  It is the N word to women  I know  But to us  Women call us what?  What's the worst term women call us?  Prick?  Prick, asshole  We don't care right?  Yeah  No  Prick, dick  We don't care  There's really no single word  The words before what they say  Yeah  That get us  Like cheap stupid prick  We go  Cheap?

[00:28:30]  Dick  What?  I bought these calls  That's what we get upset about  Defendants pretty bad  But you say anything to me  You are such a beautiful cunt  What?  The cunt is the word  It doesn't matter how you preface it  No, yeah  You are the world's most beautiful sexy cunt  Doesn't fly  It is also an argument changer  It doesn't matter what the subject of the argument was  If she leaves the room and you quietly go  Fucking cunt  And that super hearing hears it  The original argument is all of a sudden done  It's over  Actually if they don't hear it 
[00:29:00]  There's a satellite thing  Where the cunt flies up  And comes down  And they get the feed  From the other room  So you go  You fucking cheap fucking miserable cunt  What?  What did you say?  No, I didn't say anything  No, I have proof  And they get the playback from the satellite  I did that with the ex-wife once  We were having one of our usual fucking arguments  Well, ex-wife  Exactly  Why are you saying ex-wife?  It should be just cunt  And it gets  Yeah  I said that about the cunt  Cunt once  Come on  Why are you saying ex-wife?  That's  What's the  Prefix? 
[00:29:30]  And a word  It's six letters  Go to cunt  It's shorter  I knew I was  It was coming out too loud  When it was still like  At the base of my throat  I knew the volume was up too loud  But I just had to  And it was like  You fucking cunt  What?  What?  And she was one of those  That if she heard it in a bar  She'd be like  You know  Why do people have to use that?  I mean  Hated the fucking word  Now see  Here's the thing  I grew up in an Irish household  With Irish immigrant parents  And that word was  Was everything  Well over there  It's used  Yeah  It's everything 
[00:30:00]  It's the cunting car  The cunting weather  That stupid cunt of a priest  That  So we grew up  Throwing that word around  So I had a Polish girlfriend  Uh oh  Lauren  When I was like  18 years old  And she  The second day  I knew her  Second hour  Whatever it was  I said  That fucking cunting  And she was like  Did you say cunt?

How old are you, Bill?  Fucking serial killer  21  21  He has no fucking job  No fucking house  No car  No credit cards  You're fucking using him  You guys should have smelt the fucking homeless ass  For the money you're getting paid  You make this poor fucking kid do it  And scar him for life  It's called paying your dues  She must have been a pretty bad hooker  If she was homeless 
[00:57:30]  Oh, really bad  Seriously, they make money  It wasn't even a hooker for a  No, it was like  It was five dollars for a blowjob  She was more like  If you got a forty  Five bucks  Where is she now?  She'll let you pay her  It was five dollars for a blowjob  And ten dollars for the ass  I think  What did it smell like?  Uh, it smelled like fucking, uh, hell  Like something out of like  A Marquis de Sade book  Thank you, Dennis Miller  Jesus  The scratchy sniffers  De Sade  You pronounced the E  Yeah  It's de Sade  Who cares? 
[00:58:00]  I like Sade  I liked his, uh, rotting dumpster  Behind McDonald's analogy  It was a little better  Um, sorry  It's that kind of  The rancid meat thing that you said  Hey, let's go to John in Jersey  John?

That was the homeless hooker's headphones that day  Oh, my God  And she had some kind of itchy thing  That's nice  You can take a few friends home with you  Nice  Why did you smell her? 
[00:59:00]  What's that, boys?  Yes, John?  Uh, you're ripping off Howard  Hoo-hoo-hoo with the acoustics  Oh, right  Yeah, we forgot about that  Sam!  Yeah, there was a thing  I guess Howard got on the air  And said he invented  Well, he invented everything  We know that  The cotton gin  Yeah  Peanut oil  Breathing  The acoustic guitar  Breathing, walking  He actually said  This is no shit  And he actually said on his show  That MTV Unplugged  Oh, come on, Howard  Was ripping him off  Because no one ever had musicians come in  And play acoustically on radio before him 
[00:59:30]  Actually said that  Yeah, that whole folk movement  Yeah, yeah  That grand old Aubrey  I seem to remember a decade called the 70s  Well, we worked at WNEW  A legendary rock station here  And they have a whole room dedicated to live performances  Scott Muni would have Lennon come in  I love Howard  But Howard needs to get out of the house more  Yeah  You know, he's got to wake up a little bit  And PCN was doing the same thing  They had a bunch of artists coming through over the years 
[01:00:00]  You've got to realize  And every other rock station in America  By the way, who gives a fuck?  All right  It was just very funny, though  For us  Now we're going to go to Niagara Falls  Brian  Jump!  Jump!  Hey, Mr. Harry  Yeah  Are you guys making a third season to rescue me?  Yes, we are  Of course  It's coming on the air in April  Hey, you got a little roll for us, maybe?  No  What about the  Damn it!  Yeah, we have a great roll  We show up at 7 o'clock

Sure you could  Give us something  Yeah  I don't need a tall background  Just walk around New York  And we'll show up at cameras and film you  Eventually  I don't want you guys to have to exert yourselves  Eventually they'll be filming  Fucking let Norton go home  And write fucking 20 minutes of new material  And we'll show up outside your apartment  And just shoot you without you knowing about it  I'd like a part on that show  While you're fucking your 22 year old girlfriend  Pretty ballsy 
[01:01:00]  Killing off your kid on the show  This prick  Whose idea was that?  By the way  One thing I'll say  What?  In this argument  At least he's miserable  When I see him out in public  He's kind of like  How you doing?  You're always so fucking happy  Last time I saw him  I was with the girlfriend  You were like  Hey, it's my girlfriend  She's 22  I was like  I'm going to say how old she was  But I'm very happy  I used to be the prick  You're too happy  I like being happy  I spent many years being miserable  I'm not miserable  Unless I'm being blown off  By celebrities  When the fuck are you miserable?  Jimmy? 
[01:01:30]  Like Dennis Leary  What?  I'm not miserable  Unless I'm being blown off  By celebrities  Like Dennis Leary  At events in Boston  When was he miserable?  I'll tell you when he was miserable  Thanks, Jimmy  Help me out  It was back in 2003  It was a Tuesday  And he actually  He looked at his bank account  And threw up  And then realized  It was mine he saw  By accident  Thank you, Jim  Thanks for the help, Jim  Let's say hi to Dave  In Oceanside  Dave 
[01:02:00]  Hey, guys  What's up?  Hey  What's up, Dave?  Hey, Dave  Did Dennis even realize  That you guys are going to go out  Like Andy Kaufman  You're just going to be  Sitting back at home  Yeah  And you're going to have  Your doppelgangers  Sitting on the air  We know it  We know it's going to happen  We're going to get  Tony Clifton to do our show  Exactly  That would be good  All right, Dave  Have a good one, guys  See you later  That was awful  But it killed 30 seconds  Thanks  Let's say hi to Ryan in Florida  Hey, good morning  Dennis, man  How are you?  Oh, great  I'm going to go out  And buy three of those CDs, man 
[01:02:30]  Glad to have you back  Don't ever go politically correct, man  Yeah, that won't happen  Good rally cry, sir  He actually liked that  You guys played asshole  He thought it was great  So  Hockey  What do you think?  What do you think of the new rules, Dennis?  I don't like it  Why?  Because there's not enough hitting  There's not enough fighting  There's no fighting  And I'm sick and tired of seeing five on three  With three minutes left in the game  Right  You know  But I understand they're trying to establish the rules  To a certain point  And then they'll lay off  And  I don't understand why there's not 
[01:03:00]  There's no more fighting  Well, because  What was the rule change there  That is preventing people from being the shit out of each other?  Well, the rule change is  You can't hit a guy in front of the net right now  Which leads to a lot of fighting  Yeah, of course  Okay  Because you start, you know  Hit the guy and whatever  So it'll even out, I think  As the season goes on  Right now, it's pretty boring  So  What happens if you hit a guy?  You hit a guy, you get a penalty right now  Which is not hockey  And there are a lot  It's basketball  There are a lot of five on threes  A lot of five on threes  A lot of five on threes  So right now, it's kind of gay hockey  Are the Bruins doing well?  I don't even know  No, they suck  My Islanders are 
[01:03:30]  Thanks for asking  Okay  That's great  Rangers just beat them, right?  Rangers are doing great  You know  And the Islanders  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And then, well  You still put the skates on, though, right?  Yep  Why?  Why?  I like to hit people  In hockey, you can hit them without getting, you know, arrested  So I like to hit people  The hockey scenes between the fire department and the police department on the show  Are fucking hysterical  Yeah, they are  They're based in reality  When you were being nice guy 
[01:04:00]  And they couldn't understand it  Like you were insulting them by not coming back  And a very funny show  I like to hit people  And I love that fucking TiVo, man  Because I don't know how the people that do the show, make the show, sell the show  I don't know what they feel about it  But I, every series is now a film festival to me  It's a marathon  Right  I can sit there and watch back-to-back Rescue Me  From the first episode of the season to the last  And that's it  Commercials  Bye-bye  Right  Bye-bye  What happened  What's going to happen next week? 
[01:04:30]  What's going to happen in a minute?  Because that's all I got  That's the future of TV  I love it  DVR is amazing  On demand  The DVR  24, The Sopranos  Whatever you want  Family Guy  Whatever you watch  You know  And what, your new season's coming out in March, you said?  Yeah, the third season starts in April  The second season DVD comes out in March  You know, it's unique to see a show that's actually putting out a new season  Within a five-year period  Isn't that fantastic?  I know  Now we've got to wait  Fucking HBO  Hey, God bless you, Jimmy  I hope it works out for you  You're going to be like 60 for season two 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I don't get that  The way they work their fucking series there  I don't get that  Now, The Sopranos takes three years off  Yeah, it's crazy  Then you get a show, Deadwood  Which we kind of get into  Instead of making new shows  Second and third seasons  They just put new shows out there to try to entertain you  Deadwood, I got caught up in that  All of a sudden  Ah, year  We'll wait  And now Rome  I got all caught up in Rome  Last night was the season finale of Rome  And I'm hearing  Ah, next year  It's in real time of Rome  You're going to have to actually live through a few hundred fucking years 
[01:05:30]  To see what Rome's all about  Your kids will know  Your kids will tell you what happened  Pain in the ass, fucking HBO  I know, I know, I know  Once you knock them into shape  You've got to park in space  With your name stenciled on the fucking  I don't know  I just agree with all programming decisions we make  Of course you do  There's no problem with that  Faggot  So you guys going to play something from Led Zeppelin 3 or what?  Led Zeppelin 3  I hate that  That's the acoustic out  I was never a Led Zeppelin fan  You didn't like Led Zeppelin?  No, I liked him, but I was not a big fan  Do you prefer Sabbath?  Nope  What was the band growing up for you?  The Who 
[01:06:00]  Stones  First  Beatles  Second  Kings Third  Clash Fourth  The Who  The Who  He hates The Who  He hates The Who  I can hate The Who  I don't like them  Why?  Because they stink  Because they're not Sabbath  They stink  Jimmy, sing one of the songs  Come on, my generation is awful  No, what about the one you usually do for us?

One of the greatest albums ever made  They're a great band  I'm not saying they weren't a great band  I just didn't like them  That is a great record  Right?  I didn't like them  I didn't enjoy them at all  I did not enjoy them at all  My ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch  Alright, alright, you know what?  You want to talk about fucking bad bands?  Yes  Alright, let's talk about fucking Genesis  And fucking Yes  Yes stinks  And the guy from Yes  Who had his own double live album  Rick Wakeman, the keyboard player  Come on  What was their big song for years? 
[01:07:00]  Roundabout was fucking awful  Yes, very niche-y  But it had its place back in the time  You could clean your pot off of their album covers  I've never heard anybody say  They're great album covers for pot  I've never heard anybody say the Who Sucks  Yeah, he's the only one  I've ever heard that  Except Roger Daltrey when he was high  And with Pete Townsend in a bar  And Pete does numerous times over the course of the life  I had a fucking dream that I met Roger Daltrey the other night  We were walking down the street  That's a gay dream  No, no, no  This is really creepy  I followed him down the street  Because you wanted to fuck him  I had to go get my camera  Let's be honest 
[01:07:30]  Dude, I had to go get my camera  And I came back to the place  And he was in the bathroom taking a shit  See?  That's my fucking dream  That is the most homoerotic dream  Those are dreams you keep to yourself  No, but it wasn't a gay thing  It was just a weird thing  No, that's a gay thing  No, it wasn't a gay thing  It was a scatological shit gay thing  Yeah  Well, when you put it like that  Roger Daltrey  You hate the who  Because you want to fuck Roger Daltrey  Right  That's what we've surmised  In the ass  You want to fuck him  You don't want him fucking you  I'll get blood all over my shit  That was him taking the shit signified 
[01:08:00]  The shit fucked that  The shit was your dick  If he's screwing you in the ass  He'll start going  Who, who, who, who  Rock opera  All of a sudden that song will make sense  Speaking of music  You hear  They caught Gary Glitter, right?  Yeah, he was in Vietnam  Oh my god  No, you gotta hear the latest on Gary Day  The first thing was in England  I guess he was at home  His computer fucked up  He takes it to the computer repair shop  Right  They go to fix it  Actual children  Naked children  More out of his fucking computer 
[01:08:30]  Not even the hard drive  They find more kiddie porn on this thing  And they lock him up for a while  Right  They let him out  And he goes where?  Southeast Asia  The kiddie porn fucking  Capital of the world  The children mecca  Yeah  And they find him there  He actually got kicked out of Cambodia  I think  Right  Or Thailand  By the way  Cambodia  How do you get kicked out of Cambodia?  You get kicked out of Cambodia  Yeah  You have to really fuck a lot of kids  That's a sick motherfucker  Wow  You have to fuck a lot of kids 
[01:09:00]  What was he doing?  Yeah  A lot of kids  Do you want a touch?  But you know  The weird thing is  Every musician I've talked to about that  Every guy says the same thing  Like  Well it was chicks  Yeah  They were girls  He's not into little boys  He's into little girls  If you get thrown out of Cambodia  You have to fuck a baby  With an I break for Paul Pot t-shirt  They do  They send in the Hueys  And just play  Da-na-na-na-na-na  Hey  And see which kids start crying  See this is why 
[01:09:30]  We're paying the big bucks  All right  Now  Now  Now  Now they earn the money  Now we see the magic  All right  You see it  You see that fucking hymen come apart man  Hey that's how the gook testifies  I question why  Now we know  See  You pull a Paul Pot fucking reference out of your ass  A fucking hymen or two  Now you're worth the money  I love the smell of bloody diapers in the morning 
[01:10:00]  Jesus  Jimmy  See now  You make each other better  See now  You make each other better  Do it for Gary Glitter  But they found Gary Glitter right  They found him finally  I believe so  He was on the lam  They caught him  I think they caught him  They got him  Gary Glitter doesn't seem like the guy who could really  Last in the jungle  Being chased by the Cambodian army  Those heels are a bitch in the sand  He's not quite soldier wear 
[01:10:30]  Let's say hi to John  Good for him  In New York  John what's up  Hey what's going on  Hey there Jenny  Hey John  I just want to talk to Dennis a minute  Yeah  I'm a New York City firefighter  And I love his work  I mean he's a great  I think everything he does is funny  He makes me laugh  He's hysterical  But  I have to say that  A lot of firemen  Are upset  Over the portrayal  Of them being drunks  And totally dysfunctional  On the show  Just want to let you know  Yeah  No I know  No okay  Just want to let you know  Because I mean 
[01:11:00]  It is a funny show  I know it's  Well this comes up  From time to time  How many times do you hear this  Either guys love it  It's such an accurate portrayal  Or  Dude you're kind of making us look bad  Yeah  I know  That's what they say  You know  Unfortunately  My subject matter  Might be whatever it is  But I've always been true  The best comedy  The best drama  Comes from reality  So if there's a guy  Or two on the show  Who might be flawed  In terms of how people  You know  Watch the show  And take the characters in 
[01:11:30]  You know  I'm not making this shit up  Right  And this is what makes  We're not making Ladder 49  Or Backdraft here  We're making a real fire show  So the guys are flawed  But the forgiving factor  Is the fact that they go to  Work every day  And they  They love the job  And they save lives  And that's what they're about  And you know  I mean  I don't know what to tell you  I've got firefighters  In my family  I have some of my best friends  One of my best friends  From the last 20 years 
[01:12:00]  Is a firefighter in New York  Still working right now  You know  Nobody's perfect  That's what makes the show interesting  And I'm sorry  I'm sorry if you look in the mirror  And it  It hurts  But you know  If it wasn't for the dirt  There'd be no show  There'd be no show  Yeah that's what he wants  He wants the show  Where it's the firefighter  With the family  Who does his job  Goes home  That's not my show  That's not my show  Jeez this show sucks  It's so boring  This guy just goes home  One of the best things  One of the things I can say  One of the best things I can say  To solve that problem for guys  Is a friend of mine  Whose father is 
[01:12:30]  Was a 40 year veteran  Of the FDNY  Retired now  He had three sons  All three became  New York City firefighters  Two still working  One died 9-11  He loves the show  And he watches it every week  And he loves every aspect of it  So  And he was a great firefighter  And he's almost 70 years old now  So if he loves the show  I know I'm doing the right thing  So if you have a problem  I understand  But  I'm not out to make a fake show  I'm out to make a real show  And you do a much nicer portrayal 
[01:13:00]  Of firemen  Than Peter Braunstein did on Halloween  Did they catch that guy by the law?  No he's still on the line  Where is he?  How can they not have that guy  How can they not have him?  I have no idea  He's still on the lam  As they say  This little Jewish guy  Running around  And they can't find him  He studied David Berkowitz  Oh did he really?  Yeah  Now here's the latest on this guy  Apparently he got some explosives  Off the internet  He's running around 
[01:13:30]  He's got that in his possession  And he apparently has this scripted  He kind of scripted out  This whole scenario of the rape  And him running from the law  That's because he's a Jewish serial killer  And you know  We plan  We go to work in the morning  You know  This is his pitch  Wait you're singing Christmas songs  And you're Jewish?  Nobody does Christmas songs  The Jews my friend  What the Jews can't do Christmas?  No they can't  That's no prejudice  Two words for you  Irving Berlin  That's all I got  Thank you 
[01:14:00]  If it wasn't for the Jews  It probably wouldn't be a Christmas  It wouldn't be a Christmas  Alright getting back to this  I'm sorry  I was just shocked  That there's a Jew in the band  He's just running around  And they can't get him  And apparently it's scripted  Like he has scripted all the  The mother is now  The father is embarrassed to all hell  And he's saying  Please don't shoot him  When you get him  But get him  You know he's obviously got problems  The mother just spoke up the other day  And said  He did nothing wrong  Leave my boy alone  And stop  Stop trying to catch him  My son's  He's a poet 
[01:14:30]  My son the rapist  I don't understand  Because my mom  God love her  Who's you know  80 and  Irish immigrant  And a saint  But my mom  If you walked in the house  And said  We think Dennis killed 15 people  She'd go  I knew it  My mom  Would never back me up that way  I knew he was burying bodies  That son of a bitch  Where do they get these moms  Who go  Oh my son did nothing wrong  I didn't have that mom  Stop chasing him  He did everything  He killed the Jews  Yeah 
[01:15:00]  Same thing  I know  My mother  She put the fear in me  When I was a kid  To like stay out of jail  She goes  You can go  You know  Go to school  If you want to do drugs  If you want to hang out with bad people  And do illegal things  And go to jail  Fine  She goes  Don't think I'm coming there  To get you out  And that stuck with me  Through like my teen years  I'm driving around  Maybe doing a few things  I shouldn't do  And before I really  Went over the edge  You'd go like  That would pop back  Into my head  And go  I'm going to be  Standing there in jail  I ain't got to  Pot the piss in a window  To throw it out  And bail me out  I'd make that call 
[01:15:30]  To my mother  And she'd go  No  I told you  Remember  You were 8  When I told you  And I'm sticking to it  Nothing  Just leave me there to rot  I just can't believe  They don't got this guy yet  How did she feel  About the St. Patrick's thing  We don't have to talk about that  That was  I knew you were going to  Get in trouble with the church  You son of a bitch  She was more concerned  About like my job  And whether I'd be  Moving back in with her  Or something  Like no mom  I'm fine  I had to make the call  From Opie's house  I'm like  No everything's fine  Before you read about 
[01:16:00]  Shit in the news  I told her what happened  My version of it  A little  It was something  We were passing by  Some church  These assholes  Went out  Went to the church  And had sex  Nothing to do about it  But we'll be fine  We're getting jobs back  Don't worry about that  And I hung up  And just looked  Five years later  Yeah  I remember telling my parents  Yeah  It really wasn't ass sex  Yeah  It wasn't ass sex  It was front to front  Vaginal intercourse  They're saying it was ass sex  But it really wasn't  Newspapers are reporting anal

[01:43:30]  For like  It's like a rehab  For troops  That come back from the war  And they have like  You know  Missing limbs  Or something like that  And they're like 17 years old  So they have like  Their mom and dad  Come in  Not to bum you out  But  That's a nice  Nice thing to do  No and it's good  Someone's talking about this  Because I was watching CNN  This morning  And they're telling us  The whales are almost free  I was like  Oh wonderful  Who cares about the  What about the soldiers  In Iraq  It's the worst  The worst month  The worst May yet  In Iraq  So I was going to do  Maybe like a bake sale  For peace  Yeah  So that would be  Kind of  Because I  Worked in school 
[01:44:00]  Yeah absolutely  So I was like  I think car washes  Was more  I can remember like  In high school  They would have  Like the car wash  For like  The new football  And it would solve  Every problem  Like every financial problem  Yeah it's like  They give you  Bad car washes  For five bucks  Yeah scratch your car up  Completely  And you go whatever  I just bought the  I just bought the  High school new  Football uniform  Have you done  Troop shows before  You have right  I did a long time ago  And I did Okinawa  Vietnam  Yeah Okinawa  See I went back  That was pretty good  I thought I was  Going to go back  Yeah  But you went further  I went really  Speaking of the war

[01:45:00]  I hear there's artillery  Hitting and stuff  Dude I  To be honest  How did you get that  Like who offered you that  I wanted to do it  Because I was a big  Big fan of the whole  Stephen Ambrose  It's a great series  And the book is awesome  Such an easy read  And so I was like  I knew they were making it  And I was like  I want to see if I can get  Like just something  To be in there  And then  So I auditioned for it  And just  To play Lieutenant Rice  And I'm there  And it's a World War II jeep  I don't know how to drive  Regular  And this is a stick shift  So I don't know how to drive  So the act  Is that why it looked like

[01:46:00]  So then I'm even more nervous  Because there's like  300 soldiers  Just laughing at me  So I go like  Alright guys  Good luck soldiers  And I forget  To press the clutch  And there's these two guys  Push it  Struggling  Pushing the jeep  And it's going through the mud  And he's going  God what's going on  And I'm like  My head's moving like  This far  It's so like  The lamest exit  I was like  I can't believe we get fired  From Ben and Brothers  So embarrassing  So they finally got it  They put like a sound effect in  If you watch the guy  You hear like

On the Opie and Anthony show  That's right  The worst of the red-headed Mexican 
[01:50:00]  Could there be an uglier combination  Of Mexican and red hair  Ugh, and bald  Freckles  Is he Jewish, too?  Yeah  God  What a shitty gene pool  Louis C.K. wants to say hi  Louis  Hey, guys  We just saw you animated  You're going to be part of the animation festival on Thursday  You look good in animation  Oh, really?  Yeah  At least I look good somewhere  What's going on, buddy?  Not much  I look horrible right now  I'm a very ugly person right now 
[01:50:30]  Why?  Are you on the movie set?  No, I just wrapped  Are you in Lowell, Massachusetts?  No, I'm actually on the highway  You saw me at what?  No, we're up in Boston  You're filming the Ricky Gervais movie, right?  That's right  I was just up there  I think I left like the day before you guys went up there  And someone's saying  Well, let's get Louis or Ricky on the show  And I said they're up in Lowell  They're nowhere near us  Lowell's pretty far from where we were at  Yeah, it's like 30 minutes up there 
[01:51:00]  It's a shithole, too  Oh, it's horrible  I mean, you know  Retarded people  Walk in the streets with  Oxygen tanks  Really?  Like, you know  A cane  An oxygen tank with the nose thing  And retarded  And retarded  That's how retarded you are  You forget to inhale  No, exactly  No, there really are  It's like people are so fucked up there  That retarded people just walk around  Because there's not that much difference 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, who's going to, like, stop them?  Yeah, like, in a regular place  Retarded people are, you know  Put somewhere special  But there  Yeah, it's called Lowell  Yeah, they ship them all up to Lowell  Good observation there, Adam  Yeah, it was a pretty horrible place  I mean, I don't know  No, it sucked  But the movie was fun  It was fun to do  That's exciting for you, my friend  It was okay  But then my dog got hit by a truck two days ago  Oh  Yeah, it was horrible  What happened, man? 
[01:52:00]  My wife  My children's mother  What is that about, Louie?  My children's mother  Uh-oh  My baby mama  Was standing in the front lawn with the dog  And there was a deer across the street  Yeah  Just staring at the dog  The dog was barking  And she said  Get out of here  To the deer  And the dog thought  She said  Go get her  Oh, boy  And so the dog 
[01:52:30]  Ran across the street  And the truck  Hit her  And  Wrecked  Destroyed her life  Forever  How old was the dog?  The dog was nine  Oh  And she was killed  And I went  I love that dog  I mean, I traveled  I have that YouTube video of that dog  Yeah  That many people watched  And I traveled across the country with the dog like six times  So  Wait, that's the dog?  That's the dog  Now I'm affected  I thought the dog was really kind of adorable 
[01:53:00]  I mean, Roland wasn't here to give his condolences  Yeah  That was a great dog  No, and I went  I actually traveled upstate  Because I wasn't there  To see her body  And put her in the  I actually helped put her in the oven  Which is really weird  Why would you do that?  Because  I felt terrible  That I wasn't there  And  I guess I wanted to have some closure or something  And I didn't know how I would react  But once I was in this room  With incense burning  They like really  Like gave me a viewing of the body 
[01:53:30]  It was ridiculous  I just sobbed like a baby  I just sat there  And cried like a big spaggot  Oh, boy, Louie  What the hell?  I thought we were getting a joke from you today  Yeah, no, sorry  My dog's dead  And it's really  Hey, Lou  Wow  The dog died right on the spot, right?  There was no like  Oh, yeah, it had to  It depends on where the dog got hit  No, no  She died really  She was still dying when I saw her  But we were like  We put her in the oven anyway  We were like  Nah, nah  There's no chance  Put her in the oven anyway  She was still alive  I just thought  Fuck it 
[01:54:00]  You know  It's only so much you get to come  I'm kidding  She died instantly  That's better  Yeah  It's weird to shove your dog of nine years into an oven  Were your kids standing right there, too, or no?  My what?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, I had my kids stand there and watch  No, no, no  Were they on the lawn when it happened with your ex-wife?  No, they were in the house  But they heard my ex-wife's blood-curdling scream  Oh, fuck, man  That's awful  It's rough to lose a dog  Did I ever tell the Brett dog story on the show? 
[01:54:30]  No  Which dog story?  I wish you were in studio  Because I completely feel for you  Completely  This wasn't Fresca, right?  No  No, it's a drag  Dogs are with you when you're alone  You're alone in their company  Nobody else could really do that  That can keep you company  But you don't have to say a word to them for hours  It's like E-Rock 
[01:55:00]  You want  Terry Shivo  You want me to tell this story?  I'd love to hear the dog story  This deals with real emotions, Ant  So, you know  I'll give it a whirl  I'll try  Because, I mean, you know  Louis has set us down this path  I've never told this story on the air  I'll try not to choke up  So, just go from the part where you kicked it in the liver  No, no, no, no, no, no  This is my brother's dog  It was his life  A black lab  Oh, they're adorable 
[01:55:30]  It was his life  And we came home from my uncle's wake  And I'm laughing  Because this is so horrific  I can't even believe  Oh, God  So, it's my dad's brother died unexpectedly  Horrendous, horrible  And we're all just kind of at our own houses  Just depressed  You know, went through this whole wake thing  And I get a phone call from my mom  Screaming bloody murder  And I'm like, oh, my God  What did  What happened to dad?  You know, I'm thinking, you know  This caused maybe a heart attack or something 
[01:56:00]  And she goes, you better get over here  I can't console Brett  I go, what happened to Brett?  Well, his dog got run over by a car  My dad, who just came from his own brother's wake  Ran in the street  And at that time, he was only living on one artery  Picked up the 80, 90-pound dog to get him out of the road  This is the type of father I had  Like I said, I had real emotions coming out here  And then the dog died in my dad's arms 
[01:56:30]  And he put him kind of in a wheelbarrow  Just off to the side  Because it was the dead of winter  Oh, my God  It was like early February  Just a horrendous winter night  Snow on the ground  Full moon  Maybe eight degrees out  Maybe  I go over and Brett is  I can't  I can't  There's nothing he can do  He's on the floor on all fours  Just crying  And going, why, why, why, why  And inconsolable, right?  And we get him in a place 
[01:57:00]  And he looks at me and he goes  I gotta bury the dog now  And I'm like, what?  Oh, my God  So we take the wheelbarrow with, like, his life, basically  And we go into the backyard  And I thought I was in the middle of a horror movie  We are trying to dig a hole in my parents' backyard for his dog  Oh, froze over  It's eight degrees out  And as he's, like, digging  He's collapsing  Because he realizes what he needs to do  Oh, my God  Collapsing 
[01:57:30]  And I'm sitting there like, oh, dear God  And I'm holding the flashlight over this shallow grave  As he's attempting to try to dig it deeper  So he can bury his dog  I like the fact that made him dig in his grief  Instead of giving him the flashlight  Selfish bastard  Look, I'll go with you  But that ground's hard  Yeah  I think the dog would have done a great job  Digging that grave  We had one of those moments, though  Me and my brother  And he's just digging away  And I did try to help, by the way  But it was all about  He needed to do this  And I was there just to support as best I could 
[01:58:00]  What a crazy need for a closure  To actually dig a hole and stick his body  And stupid me  All of a sudden the flashlight flashes onto the wheelbarrow  And it wasn't a pretty sight  I'm like, oh, my God  I'm sorry, I'm sorry  And that got him going again  It collapses  It took hours  We're out there in the dead of winter  Like a horror movie  Burying his dog  No, because when you really dig a hole like that  It's like there's roots you've got to cut through  Oh, my God, yeah  You know, Indian pottery and whatever  Yeah 
[01:58:30]  No, when the dog died  My ex called me screaming  I mean screaming and sobbing and making no sense  And I thought one of the kids are dead  Like, actually, my first thought  Because I couldn't make any sense of what she was saying  She was screaming, sorry, sorry  And I heard dead somewhere in there  Right  And my first thought was, let it be the dog  I hope my dog is dead right now  Oh, my God  Compared to one of the kids being dead  Yeah, sure  But for a moment  For a moment, you weren't sure 
[01:59:00]  Oh, I wasn't sure  I mean, I had a sick feeling  I'll never forget  Like, somebody  I mean, she's really upset  And somebody's dead  And I hope it's the dog  And then I hear the dog's name  I'm like, okay, either the dog ate one of the kids  Or the dog's dead  Right, right  But the worst part is telling the kids, too  I have a six-year-old and a three-year-old  And I was on the phone with them  And they're crying  Oh, my God  And then the six-year-old says  First of all, she says  I'll never forget her 
[01:59:30]  And then she said  She was like a sister to me  About the dog  Oh, my God  Jesus Christ  When she said that, I almost said, like, Jesus  Right  Come on, man  Right  A sensitive little story  I gotta tell you  Where my parents used to live in Centerport  Was on a main road  And, uh, no joke  I moved home from Buffalo with a cat  That got hit by a car  And that was, in a weird way, my life  Because I was all by myself in Buffalo 
[02:00:00]  And it was like  It was just  I had this attachment to this cat  And my dad picked it out of the road  And let the cat die in his arms  And wait till it got stiff  And then he buried the cat  Before I came home from  I was working at BAB at the time  And then, uh, I can't even tell you how many pets  Your poor father has to go out on the road  And pick up dead animals  Dude, we lived on this main highway  And we always had dogs  But we never had  You had a fish  We never had a fence  I know of at least two more dogs  That ended up dying outside our house 
[02:00:30]  It's like a pet cemetery in my parents' backyard  And they called your father  He comes out in the hood  You know, it was a relief when, you know  One of our pets died of old age  And dad took the ride, you know  You know he's just dumping them in the woods somewhere  But he's like, no  I took Sprite to live  Live on a farm in New Hampshire  But dad, you've only been gone 45 minutes  And there's dirt on your pants  Right, exactly  Sprite?  I was supposed to go into an uptempo goddamn number  Right  After talking about a goddamn dog dying 
[02:01:00]  No, it's funny  And I'll let Jimmy have his moment in one second here  But what's funny is  Someone's writing  Louie, will you turn down your GPS?  We're having some real emotions on the show today  And all we hear is  Turn left in one mile  I know  I know  I heard it  I'm sorry  Yes, Jimmy  I turned it off as quick as I could  I gotta go back to Jimmy  Yes, Sprite  We decided to name our pets after soft drinks  I had one called Sierra Mist  I couldn't have Sprite  We had Fresca 
[02:01:30]  Oh my God  We had two major cars after automobiles  We had Pepsi  We had Shasta  Which wasn't a very popular soda  Remember who decided to name one of our dogs  Royal Crown  I remember when Mr. Pibb died  You notice how many dogs I just named?  Yeah  That's too many dogs for one childhood  So guess what was going on?  A lot of death  A horror show in front of our house every three years  A lot of doggy death  We have a fence  But it's an invisible fence  That's buried in the ground  And the dog wears a collar  Right  Really works 
[02:02:00]  That shocks her in the throat  When she crosses the line  But you know  They don't wear the collar after a while  They don't need to  Because they think  They don't understand it's the collar  They just think that God hurts them  When they cross a certain line  Well at least she lived a good life  Yeah  But she hadn't worn the collar  For like five years  And she was a little  A little soft on the line  And also she was so  She was so certain  That her  You know  Woman of her life  Wanted her to chase that deer 
[02:02:30]  Right  If you think I hated deer  Then now though  I want to fucking kill a deer now  Very badly  Why?  The deer was just  Minding its business  Getting chased  Fuck that fucking deer  No it wasn't  It was standing right across her line  Knowing that she couldn't cross it  Just standing there  Looking at her  Making her bark  It's a deer  Not Saddam Hussein  It's worse  I'd rather fucking  Fuck Saddam's  Open throat  Where the head used to be  Oh no  And feed a deer  No I hate  I hate that 
[02:03:00]  No it's a drag  And I'd like to sound  Funny and ironic  No you know what  I think the show  Could go down this road  Every once in a while  Now how did you get through  It with the kids?  You know what  I was really proud of my kids  Because they really  They did what you actually  Wanted kids to do  They really  Really processed it  And cried  And they know  She's gone  Like we said  You know  Maybe she's in a better place  And this girl said  No she's gone  She's dead  Doggy heaven  And here's the thing 
[02:03:30]  I take her to school  And I told the teacher  Her dog died  And she's dealing with it  She's okay  But just so you know  And so she gave her a book  That says dogs go to heaven  And it talks about God  Right  I'm like you fucking idiot  I had her facing death  And being okay with it  And you just fucking  Put in the fairy tale  She didn't need it  Yeah you gotta give them  The harsh reality  I'm thinking  No yeah  Cause she was okay  She was like  Yeah she's gone  I miss her  I'll never forget her  I'm glad she didn't get old  And sick 
[02:04:00]  But I'm sad  These are all things  The six year old said  She really processed it  Right  But this teacher now  Wants her to think  She's in a place  Where there's bowls  Of delicious dog food  Yeah it's weird  Because when my dad died  My sister decided  And I'm not saying  It's right or wrong  I'm just  You brought up another thing  I can relate to  My sister had the kids  Release balloons  For Pops in Heaven  And they do that  On his birthday  And all their holidays  And I'm like 
[02:04:30]  That's kind of nice  But I don't know  If Pops  Yeah I don't know  If Pops is ever gonna  Really see that balloon  No cause balloons  Burst when they get  To a certain point  In the atmosphere  They get to  A few thousand feet  You know what  But it's  I guess it's how  They deal with it  Because they  You know  They know something's  Not right  So they release a balloon  For Pops  I guess if it helps  Whatever  Yeah  I have an electric  Collar around my father  So you can't  Look at so far  The electric fence  Yeah  It's weird when you 
[02:05:00]  Go to a  What do you call it  A cemetery  To you know  To jerk off  On all the graves  And stuff  And people  That bring stuff  And they're really  Tacky  Like mylar balloons  And shit  Right  Oh yeah  Yeah  Just people that are  Gross and tacky  About the death  Of their loved ones  My grandmother's grave  Louie  They put a big horseshoe  Like she won  The Kentucky Derby  I love the obituaries 
[02:05:30]  Sometimes you read  Through those  And it's like  Happy fifth  Anniversary in heaven  Like what the fuck  First of all  Is he getting  The paper up there  I  You know  Exactly  I hope the fucking  Worms in your brain  Are enjoying  Your anniversary  I need  I need to take  Everything in  And go to the limit  With everything  So we had  A relative that died  I don't want to mention  Which one  And it was  It was  Three days a morning  Like you walk around  Like a fucking zombie 
[02:06:00]  And you do it  For other family members  If it was up to me  I'd be long  I wouldn't hang out  With anybody  Because it's the  It's the weaker people  And I  And I  I use that term  Very lightly  Because your emotions  Are what they are  Sure  But it's the weaker people  That bring everyone down  To a place  You know  You don't want to be  Like you're dealing  With it on this level  Or don't need to be  But then you get  Someone in the field  Oh my god  Oh god  Going over  And you're like  Why do I have to go down  To their level  Like this sucks already 
[02:06:30]  That's why  That's why  I don't  I don't  I hate those things  Where you walk around  Like a zombie  For three days  And then the thing's over  We go to the  The cemetery  And we have the ceremony  Where everyone puts a rose  On the casket  And it's beautiful  And the sun is shining  Through the top  Of this area  They give you  And it's  It's a beautiful  Last moment  Basically  And everyone takes  Their time  Putting the rose  On the coffin  And you leave  And they go  Now this concludes  The ceremony  And that's your cue 
[02:07:00]  To go  Go to a restaurant  And get food  With the family  Right  And I go to my brother  Like screw that man  Let's see what happens next  You know  And everyone goes back  To their cars  And we're lingering  Around  And we see in the back  Out the back door  Of this place  Like no joke  Four or five Mexicans  Waiting with shovels  That's the reality  They can't wait  To get the damn  Picking up the roses  And giving them  To their girlfriends  They're like  How much longer  Is this going to take  We want to  You know  To them  They're waiting for lunch  And that's the reality 
[02:07:30]  Four guys on a pile of dirt  With shovels  You know  Waiting to bury  The damn thing  They're just going to be  Sitting there  Talking  Oh yeah  They're just babbling  And waiting  Like ugh  Alright well  The last person  Has hit the car  Let's throw the coffin  In the ground  Amazing  There's one  I think a lot of  The people at funerals  Who make a big deal  Out of it  Are performing too  I mean a lot of people  Enjoy it  Yeah  I think  I mean even my daughter  Said she didn't want  To tell any of her classmates  But then she said  I'm going to tell Ava 
[02:08:00]  Or one of her best friends  Right  And when I picked her  From school  She was kind of excited  Like I told Ava  And I told Maya  Yeah  And she got to be a celebrity  Because your dog died  I remember as a kid  Wishing that my parents  Would die  So that the whole school  Would be really  Grieving for me  And I would get  Paid attention to  It was like a nightmare  As a kid  And get to like  Hold a press conference  That my parents died  Yeah  You know  And cry in front of the class  And the girls  The cute girls  Would feel bad for me  And shit  They probably wouldn't 
[02:08:30]  Oh Louie  Let me suck your tiny penis  Even though  You never know  What that is yet  You're twisted man  That death thing  When you're a kid  Do you remember  Does anyone remember  The day they realized  They were going to die  How horrific of a feeling  That was  Yeah  Because you went from  Like just enjoying  Like school  And whatever  Riding your bike  Collecting baseball cards  Whatever the fuck you're doing  To the day you realize  You have that in your memory  Like one day  What?  One day this all ends 
[02:09:00]  And then  And it doesn't go away  Until you die  Yeah pretty much  You learn how to deal with it  A little better I guess  As you get older  But that first time  You learn that  This will end  Is a horror  And I learned  I learned when  When my parents  Were going out for the night  Somehow it came up  With my older sister  As they're leaving  To go to a movie  And dinner  And I'm now  In the house  Without mommy  To like help me out here  Help me out here mommy  You know what  I found out that 
[02:09:30]  You people  Everybody dies  And I told this kid  That was a year younger than me  Benji across the street from me  This kid who I kind of hated  Yeah  And I told him  You're going to die someday  We all are  And he said no  He started screaming no  And I said yes  You're going to die  Everybody does  And so his mother came over  He went home screaming  And she came over  And said what did you tell him  And he's with her  And I said yeah everybody dies  And she goes that's not true  Wow she had a lie to him  I said what  And she says it's not true  Not everybody dies  His mom 
[02:10:00]  Wow what a lying bitch  Yeah and I said  And I  I was little  I was in first grade  So the way I argued  I said well what about  All the presidents  That are dead  Like Abraham Lincoln  And she said well he got hurt  Somebody hurt him  That's why he died  Right  And George Washington got sick  But some people never die  That is  That's quite a thing  Right there  So I  I want to pull that kid aside  And go and you won't go blind either  Don't worry  He's lying  Now Louie  Do you hate the ex 
[02:10:30]  Do I hate her  Yeah  No I can't  She's my kid's mom  So I  Well what kind of feelings  Do you have  Toward her  Considering she sort of  Might have  Made the dog do  Technically  Oh I feel bad for her  That she thinks that  That she  That she feels like  She killed the dog  But of course  There's a tiny bit of me  That thinks it's hilarious  That she's got to deal with that  Yeah  When she sleeps at night  You're sick faster  Yeah it's a weird thing 
[02:11:00]  Because when you  What you still share  Having kids  And so there's a lot of  You know  You know  A lot of great things in life  That I can only share with her  Right  And she's my least favorite  Favorite person  On the earth  Right  So  It's like if  If you and  If you  If you and Hitler  Got a puppy together  And  Then he goes off  And starts his Hitler-y life  And you're like  And you're Jewish  And you're like  God that guy's  That fucking asshole  But  Only he knows 
[02:11:30]  How cool that was  Getting that puppy  There you go  We just lost a caller  It's something that  I think Anthony  Brings up on the show  The roadside memorials  Yeah I hate those  That's another  You drive down the highway  And there's a  A cross  With a picture on it  And flowers  And notes  And teddy bears  Laying next to a tree  With like  An 18 inch chunk  Of bark  Taken off of the thing  Right  And you just know  Someone's head  Went right through  The windshield there  Oh yeah 
[02:12:00]  They don't even  Clean up the skid marks  Leading to the tree  With the cross on it  They should put those  Things down flat  Yeah  It really is  Like when you see  Skid marks end  In a memorial  Yeah  It's like the memorial  Is what happens  When the car  It's weird  Like what if  You hit one of those  What if you  Fucking hit one of those  And died  One of those memorials  That would prove  No if you  If you make one of those  You didn't  I don't  You're just a  Fucking asshole  That's such a  Embarrassing thing 
[02:12:30]  To do to the person  Who died  And it's tacky  And you didn't  Really love them  You're just showing off  Well  People mourn  In different ways  I guess  I don't  I don't really care  I just don't want to see it  So if you lay it down  Flat on the ground  You know the person  Knows it's there  And they can go visit it  Whenever they want  I actually put a mannequin  Of the person  Yeah  And like I put  Like a plastic car bumper  Like where it hit  On their body  And I play music  24 hours a day  That's how I do it  You know when somebody dies  And people go  And have a candlelight vigil 
[02:13:00]  People who didn't know them  That's so enraging  Yeah  I can't  I just want to punch them  And you see them crying  Like you didn't know  This person  And you're standing there  With your fucking mittens  Holding a candle  With paper on it  Yeah you do realize  They might have been  An awful person  When they were living  Huh  It's showboaty  Yeah  Yeah showboating  Exactly  We got Louie on the line  And who's this  Michelle  Hi Michelle  You're on with Louie CK  Who's bringing the whole  God damn showdown today  Of course  Louie is the bomb  I freaking love Louie  A lot of people love Louie 
[02:13:30]  Excellent terminology  For a white woman  Go ahead Miss  The bomb  I was just going to add to  The whole roadside thing  We just had a girl  Killed here in Pennsylvania  And it's now getting  To the point where  They're so ghoulish  That not only is there  Like a whole shroud  Of stuff  But there are people  Visiting the side  Of this highway  Right  Just on the side  Of the freaking highway  Well that's because  It's fresh dead  Oh my god  Wait a year  Wait a year or two  And the whole display  Will be very faded 
[02:14:00]  From the sun  And there will be  No visitors  No one will visit anymore  Oh we'll give a hoot  Yeah because  That's exactly it  It starts to get all  Dingy and sooty  Because in the end  A hundred years from now  No one's going to  Give a crap  That you were ever here  I've got to die  In the apocalypse  They asked me if I want  I think we're going to  Scatter the dog's ashes  Because if we get an urn  That urn's going to become  This fucking clutter  In my house  With my underwear on it  Right sure  It's just going to be  You know  I don't know  You know  Get on with life 
[02:14:30]  Well Ant's ex mother-in-law  Had the urn of  Her lovely Chester  Chester  Little Chester  That just kind of  Was on display for everybody  I wonder if she ever got  Buried with Chester's ashes  I don't know  I know she wanted to  I don't know  I know people  Have their dogs stuffed  Yeah freeze dry  Yeah  I got  Are you allowed on the air?  What?  I can sit there  You can just sit?  My radio mentor's here  Brother Weez  And he's not allowed 
[02:15:00]  To be heard on the radio  For another what  Six months?  Ah  But he was telling me  What he wants  Done to his body  And you're dead serious?  I know  Just get over there  I don't want to  Blow up your spot  But I do want to  Tell everyone  We're at  Look  And all your  He's here with  Corporate people  They don't want you  Blowing up your spot  They're all doing  The finger across the neck  Cut thing  You can at least nod  You can at least nod 
[02:15:30]  Right?  Alright  Weez  Put lights on him  Like Captain Pike  Weez is dead serious  When he dies  And I hope  It's a long time  From now  He wants  His skull  To be given  To his family  So they could  Display it  Your skull?  Skull?  His skull  He's dead serious  He's telling me  This in the diner  And I have a pretty  Open mind  And I like  I like  Almost everything  Weez says  But I'm like  You're insane  That would creep 
[02:16:00]  Everybody out  Hell yeah  What are they gonna  Do with it?  Just look at it?  Just put it on the mantle  Give him some paper  Can you write something down  At least?  Yeah they can't prove  Who wrote it  Look at  Look at  Alright  It's not a bad idea  Alright Susan  I was gonna call you  Another  You can talk?  I can talk  Do you know the story?  No  I know  He's like  Well it's worth saying  Because this is insane  He's dead serious  By the way 
[02:16:30]  He's the same investigating  Committee  They're hiding the microphone  Alright  Weez is now gonna  Write something down  On the paper  This is bullshit  By the way  That this  Fucking company  Used to work for  Won't allow him  Even on satellite radio  Because it's heard still  You know  In Rochester  Where Weez is from  Yeah  Loey  So  As Weez writes that down  What do you think of that?  That he wants to put it  I think it's an awesome idea  Just having your skull around  I mean  Because that lasts for  You know  Generations  Right  People will  You know  And you can't  The thing is that  It's a great prank 
[02:17:00]  On your family  Because no one can  Just chuck it in the garbage  You can't throw away  Like your grandfather's skull  And eventually  It'll be people  Who don't even remember  Who he was  And like  Who is this guy  Who we have his head around  So you're with this?  I would do that  Really?  Hey Weez  Yes or no  Would you allow  Like your family members  To boil the skin away  At least?  How about putting a candle  On it for Halloween?  He doesn't care  Chattering teeth inside  Chattering teeth 
[02:17:30]  It'd be great  If you have it hollowed out  And they put like  Their forks and spoons in it  See if they reach into  Whatever they eat  They have to think of it  Some nephew makes a bong  Out of it  Yeah  Loey  Before we let you go  I'm just trying to get  Some details on this  Weez skull thing  He's writing  Because  You could use it  Have your family use it  To have like  Scorpion bowls  Those kind of tiki drinks  You know  I would hope you  Break it out  During the Super Bowl  Or something  And throw some chips in  If it was a special day  For your skull to be out  Alright this is what  Weez just wrote  He wrote 
[02:18:00]  My daddy's ashes  Are on my mantle  The skull  Was yours?  Dang up your idea  You could decorate it  For occasions and holidays  And dress it up  And pray to it?  What the hell man?  What do you want  Like your family  To be Hamlet  Holding your skull  Talking to you?  Pray to it  Ah poor Weez  I knew him well  He's a progressive thinker 
[02:18:30]  But Weez  That would creep  Everybody out  Progressive thinker  No that's  Megalomaniac  I would like everybody  To worship my skull  And I would like it  To be backlit  Hey did you guys  Hear about that  Ted Kennedy's surgery  Yeah we talked about  This morning  He was awake  For the whole thing  And how  Can you imagine  Like he's  He's shaven head  Brain exposed  And he has to like  And he's talking  Like an idiot  Because they touch  His brain  And they say  Say dog  And he goes  That must have been 
[02:19:00]  The funniest thing  That's ever happened  We were saying  This morning  They're touching  Parts of his brain  And he's admitting  To all sorts of stuff  Stuff we don't even  Know about yet  Yeah exactly  But can you imagine  We described  Just imagine being awake  As they make an incision  Around your hairline  Pull back your scalp  Then they put a  Three inch hole in  Which is like  Kind of like a beer cup  That size hole  And then they have to  They use the scalpel  To remove the skin  So now they can get  To the brain  And you're awake  The entire time 
[02:19:30]  Yeah but the thing  Is the reason they do it  Is because they  So they don't cut out  The speech center  Right  They like  They touch it  And have you try to talk  And if you talk  Like a blithering idiot  Then they know  Not to cut that  Don't they know  Where that is  Isn't there a map  No well they can't  Quite tell  It all looks  Kind of the samey  Yeah  And uh  And it  But it's Ted Kennedy  Ted Kennedy  This weird character  Already  And imagine  If you're like  A nurse  You just can't  Stop laughing  Right  That he's  You know  Hey  Hey 
[02:20:00]  Okay that's  The speech center  They should shave  His ball bag  Just for the hell of it  Well you're going  For brain surgery  We're going to shave  Your ball bag though  We gotta shave  The brain  Why  Brain  So Louie  Where's the dead dog  Now  The dead dog  Is ashes  We uh  I  Put her in the oven  And I held her  While the  Down while they  Pulled the board away  And then they  Cooked her to  1800 degrees  I couldn't watch that  Yeah  There's no way  I couldn't watch that  The lady was so nice  And respectful 
[02:20:30]  And saying like  This is just  We  She just gets  Cremated  It's just  She turns into  Just dust  And a few  A few ashes  But then at the end  She goes  It's like  It gets really hot  It's like a grease fire  In there  Right  And I'm like  Oh thanks a lot  You're melting my dog  And did you really watch  I didn't  You know  Once the doors close  You don't see anything  Sure sure  You kind of have this feeling  You don't want her to be alone  Until the end  But at the same time  When you  When you look at the body  It was  It didn't look like her to me  It just looked like  Like an amazing puppet 
[02:21:00]  From like  You know  Like a really good puppet  From a George Lucas movie  So  And the ashes  You're not bringing them home  You decided  Oh we're gonna  We're gonna  Spread them somewhere  I think  For the kids  Yeah it's better  Just take  Have a ceremony  For the kids  Where we  Put the ashes  Somewhere that she  Ask the kids  Where they want  To spread the ashes  And write down their answers  That'll make for good radio  Chuck E. Cheese  Cause they're

[02:33:30]  How how how how how how how how how how  This is the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:34:00]  Rich Vossett's studio with his lovely wife, Bonnie McCarlin.  Playing Cleveland this weekend?  Yeah, the Cleveland Improv.  We're going to do our acts together this time.  Oh.  That's what people will email us from MySpace.  So, do you guys go on stage together?  Yeah, all of a sudden we're fucking still in the mirror.  I can't even get her to bang me.  I'm going to get her to do comedy with me.  It's just unbelievable. 
[02:34:30]  Is the banging way down already?  It's unbelievable.  That's not true.  Well, with us it is.  I still bang, but sometimes you're not in the room.  She's so fucking busy.  We were in the hotel the other night.  She's so what?  Fucking dizzy.  What?  What do you think I said?  Rich, dizzy.  Yeah, I have an inner ear infection and I literally am dizzy.  Oh, all right.  That's fine.  That was a fucking 40s expression.  What a dizzy dame.  You know what else he always says? 
[02:35:00]  Dizzy broad.  I hipped you to Diet Coke, didn't I?  He thinks he hipped me to everything.  Hipped you to it.  Stop taking your Lenny Bruce character so seriously.  Listen to me.  We're fucking enough.  And I'm dizzy broad.  I hipped her now.  I took her.  I mean, we were in the hotel the other night.  Go on, Daddy.  So the smoke alarm, the smoke alarm's going off.  She goes, can you press the, you know, press the button.  So I go up there and press the button.  She goes, your cigarette is making a smoke alarm go off. 
[02:35:30]  And next to her on the bed, the little dresser, there's a fucking towel on fire from her candle.  She's sitting there reading and there's a fucking towel on fire.  She's going, you got to put your cigarette out.  No, but like it was still five.  What were you, bedrock?  Fucking lights.  I didn't even use a light.  But you do have to.  Because I light a smelly candle because of the cigarette smoke.  Yeah, stop smoking.  Why don't you stop?  Oh, my God, Rich.  Somehow get it.  We're not going to your funeral if you die of lung cancer.  Why don't you stop? 
[02:36:00]  Well, I didn't think you would.  You didn't go to the wedding.  Why would you go to the funeral?  Imagine that.  Oh, I can't make it that night.  Oh, Rich.  Finally, Patrice and Billy Burt bring a present.  He smashed us.  You're taking that hard stuff.  No, no, I'm not.  I let it go.  We all explained ourselves on a past show.  I let it go.  So, dude, why don't you want a cigarette smoke?  I am.  I'm going to go to a hypnotist.  I just got the link for it.  I just got the link for a hypnotist.  What kind of bullshit answer is that? 
[02:36:30]  Not a hypnotist.  A fucking laser.  You can get laser surgery.  That's a really big difference.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Laser?  Yeah.  To quit smoking?  Yeah, yeah.  What do they do?  Unless they weld your mouth shut.  No, I don't know.  What the fuck do they do?  What do they do with a laser?  I think they actually laser a part of your brain, don't they?  No.  I can't fuck my brain up anymore.  They cannot laser a part of your brain.  Yeah, just someone like Nicholson at the end of Cuckoo's Nest.  In Staten Island, some lady I met said she went and got lasered. 
[02:37:00]  There is no surgery.  She was wearing a toga.  I got the link.  Let me tell you something.  We will look at the link.  Give it to Iraq.  He will punch it up.  I will guarantee you, there is no way they touch your brain with a laser to make you  stop smoking.  They do something, maybe googly your eyes or something, or it sounds like a scam to me.  Rich is trying to find a way to quit smoking that's not going to hurt.  Zero pain.  Stop it. 
[02:37:30]  Esty took me down for the patch.  I love to fucking smoke.  You smoke more than I do, but I smoked for 17 years.  Jimmy liked to smoke.  Anthony, one day I was going to quit.  I said, I'm going to finish this pack, and Anthony was just fucking put the cigarettes  down.  I said, I'm having one more.  I had one more.  It was a Friday.  I went down to the cellar.  Esty marched me over, got me the patch.  Just marched?  Was he leading you with an SS patch on his fucking shoulder?  Was fucking Adolf.  Yes.  We marched. 
[02:38:00]  He cleans out the apartment complex.  The patch had a swastika on it.  Yes.  It was a lovely red patch on my...  Why are you still going for bargains?  Why don't you just go to a reputable guy and get it done?  He wants to do it without pain.  Rich wants to quit without the fucking emotions.  You're going to cry a lot.  I've been crying for five years since I quit.  It's more like...  I don't understand that the guy is an addict.  You have overcome booze and drugs.  And gambling.  So you know that the only way to really stop... 
[02:38:30]  There was no patch for crack.  There's no fucking laser for booze.  It's you got to just stop.  Yeah.  I think that's all bullshit.  I almost stole Rich's joke in front of him.  Or Bonnie's joke in front of Rich.  That it's all bullshit.  No.  Who once said that Rich only did drugs as an excuse for blowing guys?  Is that you?  Or was it?  I just thought of that and I realized that's not you.  I said I quit just for the applause break on stage.  Yeah.  That's funny. 
[02:39:00]  That's good.  That's not what I was quoting.  No, but that's another joke I threw in there.  Oh, of course.  But see, you do what I say that you always do.  What?  You try to steal the laughter from whoever got the last laugh.  Yes.  Yes, he does.  You're saying what Rich does is Rich was piggybacking that moment and trying to be the last one to speak.  So it looked like his moment.  It's called tagging.  It's called tagging.  You didn't tag it.  You didn't tag it.  That's not a tag.  That's a whole new little story that you brought up.  Oh, look.  This is comfortable all of a sudden everywhere she goes now.  She's on stage now. 
[02:39:30]  This is a fucking broad.  I was reading a piece of paper in L.A. off a stool.  Now she's on stage with her foot in the front table fucking leaning into the mic and working the crowd.  Okay.  And every now and then one of my fucking lines comes in and goes, hey, you know, you got so many of them.  But she's getting too confident.  And that's the problem.  I'm going to have to bring you to the stress factory again to fucking humble you.  I don't give the same love as I used to.  Wow.  Remember when they first hooked up?  It was just about love.  That's when we first hooked up. 
[02:40:00]  It was kind of a drop off here just a bit.  Wow.  And then Golly over here, he's getting a little scared of his position, I think.  I also hear a lot of avoidance about the smoking question.  Okay, Dr. Phil.  That's right.  Dana Reeves just died.  Absolutely.  She didn't smoke.  She didn't smoke.  She had the secondhand smoke, they're saying, or something.  The secondhand smoke or something?  Was his wheelchair a locomotive?  Who was smoking, Nira?  He had little kids and an invalid. 
[02:40:30]  From being a, she was like one of those torch singers.  Oh, so she was in a lot of clubs.  That's what they were saying.  With the smoke.  I had a little info on that.  All right.  Very good.  I'm glad you did.  I know I sound stupid, but she was a singer in the lounges back in her day.  And they're saying maybe it was the secondhand smoke from way back when.  I don't think that.  I think that whole secondhand smoke is bullshit.  I should quit.  What are you so scared of?  Because...  You have fucking kids.  You want to see graduate college.  Why don't you stop?  My kids aren't going to college. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, okay.  They keep smoking.  You have kids that you're going to have to drop off at the Bada Bing.  Hey, were you?  At the Regal Beagle.  Were you in Sacramento?  Yes.  Last week?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Richard.  Get an update.  A review.  Yeah, I was at the show in SAC over the weekend on Sunday.  Great show.  You were there on Sunday?  Yeah.  I couldn't believe you smoked on stage.  That was awesome.  Was that?  Oh, yeah, because you're not allowed to smoke in a club.  You rebel.  You're not allowed to smoke within like 10 feet of a building in Sacramento. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  That was awesome.  Born and killed, too.  Yeah.  We did.  I did.  It was a good show, huh, Richard?  Oh, real good.  Yeah, right on.  Cool.  Yeah, it was great.  He tore a couple audience members up.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  I mean, Richard, Richard.  Richard Voss here gets a bad rep sometimes.  We like to kill him on the show, but it takes a lot of heat on the show, but very funny  when you see him live on the stage.  Thank you.  Now, the bottom line is, Voss, you've been lying about quitting for years.  Listen, we're talking about my fucking stage performance, and all of a sudden you've got 
[02:42:00]  a...  Absolutely.  The guy brought up smoking on stage is what happened.  Said he was...  Yeah, so Richard killed, and he was smoking.  You'll be talking...  You've been quitting.  I'm going to quit on my birthday.  I'm going to quit on my anniversary.  I'm going to quit this.  And every one of them passes.  I'm sure we got tapes from N.E.W. of him saying he's going to quit soon.  Yeah.  That was years ago now, Rich.  You can't fly and smoke in the airport.  It's awful.  I smoke in the airport.  It's in the bathroom.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you stop?  What are you so scared of?  Just stop.  I'm not scared.  Well, I am scared, but you know.  What else do I have?  What do you do on the flight? 
[02:42:30]  You're not going to lose a piece of shit.  I do nicotine gum.  New York to L.A.  What do you do?  Well, he complains a lot, number one.  Nicotine gum.  And I sleep a lot.  You're not going to.  You're afraid.  No.  You're afraid, A, of being uncomfortable, and B, like you're going to lose a piece of  who you are.  You're not going to lose a part of yourself.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  I'll make a deal with you.  We'll pick a date, and I quit smoking, and you quit deviant sexual behaviors.  I've already quit smoking, and when-  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I quit gambling.  Hold on. 
[02:43:00]  When deviant sexual behaviors put a tumor on my jaw, I'll quit doing them.  Yeah.  What about a fucking lesion on your face?  Not my problem.  I'll just pass it along.  No.  See how easy it is?  What are you so scared of?  I've already quit smoking.  I've already quit gambling.  I quit drugs.  I'm talking about an immediate health risk that's going to fucking kill you, dude.  Some of Jimmy's girls have looked like tumors on his jaw.  I know what you're saying, dude, but I'm not being holier than now.  I'm not saying quit addictive behavior because it's naughty.  I'm saying smoking is an immediate awful health risk. 
[02:43:30]  I'm not making a moral judgment.  I'm saying it's a fucking horrible risk, and I've quit.  I know how awful it is.  And I'm not being self-righteous.  At least you get the AIDS.  You know, you got 10 good years.  Absolutely.  And you can fucking always just pretend you got it from a needle or, you know, blood transfusion.  I got sick ones.  And you will look thin at some.  Bad dentist.  And you can eat all you want, right, because you're going to lose the weight eventually.  And my sexual addiction, I'm not running into a bathroom in the airport anymore. 
[02:44:00]  That's because they clogged up all the holes in the dividers.  It does look, though, Jim, like you purposely try to find women who may have something wrong with them.  I'm not saying, look, I'm not saying that an uncle 15 years ago doesn't help my cause, because it does.  The worse your family, the better it is for me.  But 15 years ago, you knew better.  Maybe more than 15.  Not the girls I'm dating.  Your uncle touched you when you were 21, 22? 
[02:44:30]  No, one.  That's what I'm saying, 15 years ago.  Your uncle didn't touch you.  There's nobody that desperate in your family.  Why don't you quit smoking?  I'm good.  Here's the game plan.  Oh, boy.  All right?  Okay, I'll make a deal with it.  There's a plan now.  That's good.  June 30th on my birthday.  Oh, stop.  One of the first things you said to me when we started dating was that you were going to quit smoking June 30th on your birthday.  And June 30th came and went without incident.  You didn't even bring it up. 
[02:45:00]  I was already bagging you, so what the fuck?  I already closed the deal.  I had to come up with a new lie.  And his sober date.  He was going to quit on a sober date.  I've heard that one.  I've heard I'm going to quit after the holidays, after the stress.  There's never a good day to do it.  Yeah, you just have to trick yourself.  You just have to one day just go put your cigarettes down.  And realize it's going to hurt a little bit.  If I still obsessed, I'd be smoking again.  You think I could go this long obsessing?  How long did you quit?  December will be five years. 
[02:45:30]  No.  Wait, December of 2001.  It'll be five years in December.  I remember when that was.  It was when we were doing the what have you got segment of the show.  I had a moment about it.  What the hell is that?  Oh, yeah, the guy brought the login.  It was what the hell is that?  No, the guy was.  We had a couple of doctors in the studio.  And we had guests come in.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  I was actually.  Take his seat.  Take his seat.  You can have my seat, Colin.  Colin Quinn just ripped Voss out of his seat. 
[02:46:00]  Took his headphones.  You were raped.  Oh, man.  That's the most exercise he's done in a month.  Colin, you picked the perfect day to stop by.  You picked the perfect day to stop by.  Get in on this.  Voss is telling us he's going to quit smoking again.  But as Colin walked in, I was thinking about Colin.  That's fucking really creepy.  That's great.  You're a psychic.  Is that awful bandage on your nose?  That's from one of the girls he's dating.  Let's get Colin Quinn a mic. 
[02:46:30]  We need a chair for him.  Surprise.  Oh, what is that?  Colin should not just stand.  You look like I'm expecting Bud Fox to save you.  Nothing?  No, that's not bad.  LA Confidential?  Hey!  Come on!  Just threw his breakfast on the floor.  The reason I came by, by the way.  Okay.  Are we going to have an intervention or something?  Something in the sea that's going on.  No, it's an intervention for you two guys.  Uh-oh.  What do we do?  A little power corrupts. 
[02:47:00]  Apparently, from giving this idiot a voice on the radio, he drove me home last night in  his Toyota Caddy.  Have you seen that Camry that he calls a Caddy?  Toyota Caddy.  Norton, have you seen it?  It's the worst Cadillac ever.  It's nothing like he shows me.  He's like, oh, yeah.  Looks like a Camry.  So he's got the most awful GPS that, like, you know, it's crayons.  It's an eight-year-old girl.  And then, uh, so last night I was driving home, this moron told me, uh, you know, I don't 
[02:47:30]  believe much in conspiracy.  He always has to deny that he believes in everything and then he believes in it.  Like, I'm usually, so he can feel like he's a unique guy instead of just another, uh, you  know, strip-all idiot like the rest of us.  And he's like, I'm not a conspiracy guy like some of these idiots.  And he goes into this thing about the wing nuts.  We heard about it, yeah.  It was just so aggravating.  I felt like saying, you know, either do charity or learn a musical instrument. 
[02:48:00]  Fucking phony bore.  It's so boring.  What a shithead.  I mean, if you saw these photos, he goes, give me away.  I'm not giving you my fucking emails.  He can wait.  Send me some shitty pictures.  Go back to porn.  At least then you were kind of excited.  What a phony.  Instead of reading a book or taking a class, this is what dumb people do to feel intellectual.  They check out, like, the size of planes.  They go, I mean, if you look at the vector, there's some other shit.  Because some other asshole sent it to him and go, you know, this is not a 757. 
[02:48:30]  Yes, it probably is, but who gives a shit?  You boring idiot.  It was actually...  Take that thing off.  Is that a sleep apnea thing?  What else could it be?  Colin, you're on fire.  Don't sit down.  I'm not going to sit down.  He's working the room.  He's pacing back more than just doing some crowd work.  I think it's hot because you don't have to, you know.  Oh, my God.  We all do that, though.  We'll read all those political books and then just reciting what we just read to other people.  But I was honest about where I got it.  I didn't say I made it up.  I said that I found a credible source. 
[02:49:00]  The gravitas in his fucking idiotic face is what got to me.  He put the pressure on me, though, now to dispute this.  He goes, I'll send you the link, watch it, and then you tell me where the piece came from that isn't a 757.  Oh, tell him to prove it, and then you go, well, what's the motive?  I don't know, but.  Well, that would be part one of this argument.  But I don't know.  Tell me the motive.  Then don't bring it up until you have a motive.  Well, I don't have to have a solution.  No, a motive is different from a solution, you.  Yes, it is.  A motive is a solution as to why it happened.  Why would the government shove a plane into the Pentagon? 
[02:49:30]  I don't know they would.  Because they were waiting for the right opportunity.  So that day when two planes went into the World Trade Center, they said, now's our chance.  Quick.  Because the ones that went into the Trade Center are legit.  It's that Pentagon one.  Yeah.  They just had it sitting there waiting for that to happen.  He raised some good points, and I had to say he raised some good points.  And you raised no good points.  I didn't say I did.  Beat it.  I really felt good to play.  There are bars in town.  I saw him last night.  Bring him in.  I can call him.  Beat it. 
[02:50:00]  Beat it.  Well, we were talking about Rich Voss and his dumb smoking.  He's got to stop smoking.  Yeah, why don't you stop, stupid?  But he's almost smoked three packs a day, and I quit.  When you quit?  15 years.  But he won't tell us why he won't quit.  He keeps making excuses.  He's afraid.  And setting dates when he might quit.  You want to know why he won't quit?  Because I fucking smoke.  We all smoke.  Jim smoked.  He quit.  Because you're afraid to deal with the sadness and the fear and the anger that's going to  come out when you quit smoking.  You don't have something to hide behind. 
[02:50:30]  Most of all, I deal with anger and fear on a daily basis.  Yeah, by lighting up five packs a day.  And the fetal position.  Oh, no.  Some use the miscarriage.  Do you know that fire that you were talking about in the hotel room is directly because  of your smoking, not because of her candle?  She lit a candle to stop the smoke.  That's right.  No, she was reading tarot cards.  No, that's not true.  If she was reading tarot cards, she's as crazy as you are. 
[02:51:00]  Don't she eat some more?  Were you reading tarot cards?  Were you reading tarot cards by candlelight?  No.  I get a, you know, a scented candle.  Oh, my God.  And it's just for the...  It's a candle because it's night.  And it's just for the smoke, right?  Yeah, it's for the smoke.  Do you make him open up the anti-suicide windows like that fraction of an inch?  Last night I was there.  Yeah, you were there puffing out there.  It doesn't work.  Blows it right back into the room.  One night I look over.  He's in bed with a cigarette asleep. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, that's never resulted in thousands of deaths.  Did you ever see his old apartment on the fucking floor?  They were going to look like little black snail trails because this fucking lazy Jewel kept  falling asleep with cigarettes in his hand and dropping them on the floor.  He's not going to die from lung cancer.  He's not going to...  He's just going to burn up.  He's going to take a bunch of people with him.  He's fucking, he's sanding something and putting varnish on it and he falls asleep and  fucking kills everyone in the house.  What's a little Richie afraid of when he takes the cigarette away and there's no barriers  between him and the world?  That's right. 
[02:52:00]  What is, I'd like to know too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, you know, it's...  No, no, just, I'm not afraid of anything.  What is little Richie...  You are.  It's addiction and, you know...  Right, but what does addiction come from?  Pile of ashes.  It's a gold chain and teeth.  It comes from...  You feel comfortable sitting there with something blocking, a big wave of smoke blocking you,  not only from the world but from your alleged wife.  Absolutely.  She's reading tarot.  She's reading the tarot card by candlelight. 
[02:52:30]  And tea leaves.  Yeah, she's got to eat tea leaves.  It's the modern day knitting when her husband's not really...  Yeah, they still are coming up with hobbies so they don't have to hang out with each other.  How quick did this fall apart?  This is the shortest marriage.  I want to fucking know what exactly, like, you are, like, everyone hides.  You hide your fear behind fucking cigarettes.  Other people hide certain failures behind a lot of food the last year and a half.  I knew it was coming.  I know.  Can I see your...  Great telegraph acting technique. 
[02:53:00]  Jesus Christ.  Can't wait to see Lucky Lou here.  We call it King of Queens with cursing.  Perhaps, Rich, you, when you started smoking, whatever it was, 20-some years ago, when, how long was it?  20.  I don't know.  Okay, so a long time ago.  30-something years ago.  You needed the cigarettes because of your, whatever, your fear, your unhappiness, and 
[02:53:30]  now you're addicted, but maybe you don't need the cigarettes anymore.  You have a lovely bride.  Maybe you're better.  You should be happier now.  I'm very happy.  I got a lot...  Look what you scored, bro.  I'll tell you what it is.  Yeah, he did score big.  The problem is, you still want to think I'm Rich Voss, a teenage rebel, or an old man  a few years away from poker.  Just admit it, and you're in the scars, and walk around.  Your new edition could be complaining about your ills.  Old Jews don't smoke.  What's the matter with you?  I hipped you to Jews.  It's a cause. 
[02:54:00]  You leave my stuff alone, Noah.  I won't touch your stuff, but you've got to stop smoking.  I'm going to.  I really know you.  No.  Set a date.  Just set a date.  Set a date?  Not set a date.  But don't do it for us.  You do it now.  You don't set a date.  How many times do I say I want to quit smoking?  You don't set a date.  You know what you do?  I've never heard you say that.  Where's your pack?  Huh?  Here's how you do it.  Where's your pack?  It's out in the car.  You know what?  Anthony goes to the side.  It's on.  Anthony goes to the old school Ron Conkoma style.  Give me the pack. 
[02:54:30]  Ron Conkoma.  In Anthony's family, you just see one of the uncles come out in the Bermuda shorts with  the sandals.  Give me the pack.  He's smoking.  Give me the pack.  Give me your cigarettes.  When you quit, there you are.  Done.  But that was how he helped me quit.  He fucking...  Anthony helped me quit by that same disgust to just fucking throw the pack out.  You immediately throw it away.  And I did.  I thought I had one more and that was just for me.  Yeah, because it's water or one of these people, remember?  No, no.  It was the guy with the thing on his lip jaw.  We were playing.  What the hell is that? 
[02:55:00]  What the hell is that?  We have doctors in the studio and people would come up and get free examinations for whatever  they got.  Something on their legs, something on their...  And this one guy had a bump on his gum line.  So the doctor put the glove on and he's feeling it.  He goes, that's a hard lump.  That's not good.  He goes, you have this checked out immediately.  He goes, you smoke?  And the guy's like, yeah.  And the guy's...  And then we start talking about how he's going to look with half a jaw.  Well, the fear on the guy is like, oh God, just tell me what it is.  Tell me what it is.  I mean, it was supposed to be a fun bit and turn it to...  Jimmy quit. 
[02:55:30]  That guy...  It was horrific.  And one doctor, just to add to this, punched out.  He's like, I don't want to be part of this.  Wow.  He saw what was in that guy's mouth and said, I'm done.  I don't want to be part of this.  The guy turned out to not have...  Right.  We found out a month later.  But when he was trying to go, the guy was like saying, all right, where should I go?  What should I do?  And watching him try to hang on to his sanity, I'm like, that is exactly what it looks like  when you find out you have mouth cancer.  Yeah.  He's like, that is exactly a moment.  Because the guy was trying to not panic.  And that's what freaked me out.  But it was panicking him. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  Where do I go?  What should I do?  Who should I go to check this out?  And just, yeah.  You know, I want the best guy and I'll never forget that day.  You ever stop smoking for a limited time because maybe you had something, you didn't know what  it was and you're like, uh-oh.  Uh-uh.  Nothing like that.  No.  No?  No, no.  I smoked nonstop.  Just set a date, you phony.  You did quit for six months.  I set a date.  You did quit for six months.  I quit for six months.  Why?  What spurred that?  I was working in Boston and I went and saw the Mad Russian.  There was a guy up in Boston that everybody's...  I went to that guy that didn't work for me.  You went to see... 
[02:56:30]  Huh?  No.  He's just a douche.  He doesn't work for anybody.  Shut up.  I went six months.  What's the Mad Russian?  He was some...  Some fucking flake.  You call me a flake for conspiracy theories?  Some fucking commie pushes...  Why did you throw my Aussie doll on the milk?  Anything we think somebody might love has to be destroyed.  That's right.  He broke my trophy on his dumb show. 
[02:57:00]  That's really funny.  This fucking Aussie doll.  There was a little Aussie thing that Stalker Patty gave me.  And he just ripped it up in Boston.  Oh.  Oh.  Things are going bad.  She's the only person that emails me consistently.  Who's the Mad Russian?  So, Colin, when's your show on so I can be on again?  The Mad Russian is this fucking flaky douche in Boston.  And you sit there and he does an energy thing over you and supposedly makes you quit.  And I'm an asshole for thinking that it's fucking the coffee. 
[02:57:30]  Why did you go?  It's really 21 years.  How about this?  Fuck your aunt.  She was ready to quit.  Yeah, well, if you're ready to quit, maybe that's a help.  I'm really impressed.  Maybe that's a help.  Maybe that's a fucking aunt.  You should do everything you can do.  I mean, you should...  What?  Yeah, get a patch.  Get hypnotized.  Do all of it.  Do you like the smoking, Bonnie?  Everything.  I love it.  I don't want him to quit.  Subconsciously wants him to die.  What'd you do?  What'd you do with Bonnie?  You know he has no money.  The false fortune.  It's really not fun to be around somebody who's quitting smoking. 
[02:58:00]  And I'm not looking for him.  How fun is he now?  How much fun could he possibly be?  Did you ever smoke, Bonnie?  Ever?  Yes.  You're dead.  It took me many tries to quit.  And you quit?  Yeah, so four years ago.  How long ago?  Four years.  You miss it.  Actually, at one point, before I started dating Rich, I thought I might actually start again.  It's very rough when you hook up with a smoker and you've quit for a while because you just  pick it right back up again.  Well, she drinks and gets high every now and then, so that was hard, too. 
[02:58:30]  Stop trying to even it up.  Maybe you can handle booze now.  No, I can't handle booze.  I know a smoker's thing next week.  Next Sunday, I'll go with you.  To a smoker's thing?  Yeah, like a smoker's meeting.  Next Sunday?  Yeah, Sunday night.  You're not working.  Stop acting like you're on.  Wait, what's Sunday?  This Sunday?  Sunday coming up.  Yeah, I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  He doesn't even know where Sunday is anymore.  I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  What, Sunday?  Sunday what?  What, between Saturday and Monday?  No good.  No good.  And Colin, as much as after that Aussie doll thing, how I really don't want to admit 
[02:59:00]  this, helped me more than anybody.  The thing he said to me, which I don't think you made up, but he said to me, the urge  to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not.  And that was as perfectly simplistic as I needed.  Well, it's the same as drinking and getting up.  Shut up.  Stop trying to act like you, too, understand this.  You're still smoking, kiddie.  Rich loves to be the expert on addiction. 
[02:59:30]  He'll just jump in.  Oh, please.  Listen, just put your car.  Look at Bobby.  Guess what?  Every guy's like that.  No matter who you're married, you'd be miserable every time they open their mouth.  Boss, are you going to the Freedom Center?  What the fuck is the Freedom Center?  That's the laser therapy thing.  Somebody goes, what the fuck?  You're not doing it.  It's Staten Island.  Welcome to Freedom Laser Therapy.  What does lasers do to make you stop smoking?  Freedom from smoking addiction.  It's Staten Island.  I don't know.  They probably make a good cigarette lighter.  He's done no research.  Light it up with a laser.  He's done no research on it. 
[03:00:00]  None.  Someone said laser.  Someone said it to him.  Dummy thought technology.  It's the future.  No problem.  They'll take out that little cell that makes me smoke.  Oh, stupid.  You think they're going to do some kind of brain thing.  I think it's Dave Wardow that I told you about it.  What's the gimmick here?  They don't really explain.  Oh, good.  It's vague.  It's lasers and it's vague.  Low-level laser therapy.  Hold on.  I think I have it.  You don't have to wear contacts anymore.  They use some kind of Jedi mind shit on you.  You don't need that cigarette anymore. 
[03:00:30]  You have no need to smoke.  You'll feel great.  As soon as you hit Sunday, when you get back in town, we'll go to a place.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We've got Tyler in Columbus.  Tyler for Rich Voss.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, you guys were just talking about that guy that had the big lump in his mouth from  years ago.  Yeah.  My father-in-law got the big casino in his jaw and about a month ago, he just had it removed.  He's about, what are you, boss, about in your 40s?  Good call.  He's 85. 
[03:01:00]  What did he have?  The big what?  Just cancer.  The big casino.  Oh, I thought he had like Caesars or Bounties.  No, he's actually had cancer in his mouth quite well.  You know what I mean?  No headphones?  For Rich?  For Rich.  For Colin.  Why would there be headphones for somebody that's in studio with us?  Look.  Why?  Why would we have that?  Colin actually took a toilet paper tube to his ear and he put it to Rich's head.  It's a great photo of him.  He's hearing the C.  20 shots for you.  Wait.  That's wacky.  That's wacky. 
[03:01:30]  Wait.  So he had his whole jaw removed, not the tumor?  Yeah.  They had to take his, the cancer spread through actually the bone in his jaw.  There you go.  There you go, boss.  And actually the veins and everything in his jaw and they had to remove the whole damn  thing and rebuild it.  They took like hip from, or bone from his hip and skin from his chest and legs and made  him a new jaw, but he's all.  Hey, boss, stop it.  Dude, this guy's telling me.  I know.  This guy right now.  I just a million of these stories.  If I'm not fucking ready, I know.  Yeah, by the way, caller, you know what?  During your story, Rich was checking his bookings on his Palm Pilot thing. 
[03:02:00]  No, I was trying to find the quit smoking thing right here and I found the link, the  website or whatever.  No, I mean, people.  Yeah.  Right next to the link to buy cigarettes online.  You know, all that shit, but it's like, you know, when you see it, like I'm sitting  across the room from the guy and it's like, tongue, his dead tongue, his tongue died.  They had to remove that too.  So like 80%.  That wouldn't be so bad.  All right.  There's an upside to the whole thing. 
[03:02:30]  But wait a second.  Was that from smoking?  Yeah, it was from smoking.  Or chewing tobacco?  No, he didn't chew.  They said he got the cancer from, they told him he was going to cancer his mouth from  smoking.  Find another way to justify it.  Yeah.  Filterless?  That's all?  One hundreds.  Is he a Christian?  Plus, it's not going to help those tombstones you call teeth, you know, they're turning  gray from smoking.  All right, Tyler.  All right.  I'm sorry you didn't get the reaction you were looking for. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  No, he's got a point, which is Voss has to have the guts to go to a cancer war.  We've had to get a car crash, so it's all good.  No, you're fine.  Thanks.  All right.  You know what I'm going to do?  April 22nd.  Why April?  That's my ex-wife's birthday.  Why are you picking a date?  He's supposed to pick a date.  Is that it?  I've done all that stuff.  I just quit.  I once was just like Rich Voss.  Really?  I tried it all.  The mad Russian.  All of them.  Well, here's where Rich is going.  Oh, the laser thing?  Now, what do they do?  It's a therapy you can't even pronounce, oriculoral therapy. 
[03:03:30]  That's what I was picking.  It's the one word he can't pronounce.  Is it saying something like ocular?  A-U-R.  A-U-R.  No.  It's natural.  A-U-R.  A-U-R.  What do they go through?  Your ear?  I-C-U-L-O therapy.  Auricula.  Auricula.  All right.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  If this involves your fucking ear.  Here we go.  What is it?  It's a non-invasive form of acupuncture.  No needles.  It utilizes a minor electrical impulse to stimulate acupuncture points in the outer ear.  I did that one, too.  I did that one, too. 
[03:04:00]  It didn't work.  Really?  Don't be asked.  Why do you think a laser beam in your ear is going to stop you from smoking?  It might stop these zists that are in the back of my ear.  It's going to start boiling the system.  The doctor's going to drop dead.  I'm surprised you could even let the, you know, the wetness would put your cigarettes  out immediately.  I know.  He bit them out.  This technique's been used for pain, addictions, and a host of many other dysfunctions.  I did it.  It didn't work.  Dysfunctions. 
[03:04:30]  How can you tell it?  It's new.  I did it.  They didn't have it back then.  It's new.  I did it.  It was the acupuncture.  You know how stupid Voss is?  It says around the website that they've been doing this since 500 B.C. in China.  I haven't checked the website out yet.  It's new.  Like gunpowder.  What are you, a pterodactyl shit?  Your ads may be, but...  They invented the wheel and then this technique the next day, but it's new to Voss. 
[03:05:00]  The newest thing since the stone tool.  Fucking Voss.  I haven't actually gone to the website yet.  It's new.  Forget about it.  It's like there, 500 B.C. in China.  I hip to the acupuncture.  I'm talking about what to get, like, acupuncture.  Norm MacDonald goes, you know, that's great stuff because I was injured.  Because they've used that for millions of years in China.  I go, yeah.  He goes, yeah, then they invented medicine.  You guys always had a TV quote each other? 
[03:05:30]  What?  That was pretty funny.  I wish I had a car.  I don't want to use the car crash.  I want a clip of him lighting up.  What did Kevin Nealon have to say about it?  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You're listening to the worst of Obi and Anthony.  Obi and Anthony.  Hey, everyone.  This is Patrice O'Neal.  And this is the worst of Rich Voss, which I could really just go, hey, Patrice. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  It's Rich Voss.  Why would you even have to add?  What he's worst of is a walking adjective for Rich.  It's always the worst of Rich.  Even when it's not, like, this is really some play on words like the best of Rich, but it's  just a lot of Rich.  That's what the fuck this really is.  All right.  So the smoking thing.  Did you go and smoke?  No, just now I went to the bathroom.  Can I tell you what happened?  He told everyone at the, when we were at the Mitch Hedberg tribute, he told everyone 
[03:06:30]  the day before that he was going to quit smoking the next day, because it was really close  after we come into the studio and you guys were bugging him.  I knew it was wrong for you to tell everyone, but I was excited.  I wanted it to be true.  And the day that he was supposed to quit, he, within 20 minutes, was smoking after he  got up.  He goes, I'm going to do it tomorrow.  And then tomorrow.  You're never going to quit.  They're going to take it.  And I said, you couldn't even go 20 minutes.  And he was like, I didn't get up in the middle of the night to smoke, though.  And I wanted to.  So that was his life. 
[03:07:00]  So that's a good start, right?  Rich, you're wrapped up in terror.  You feel like you're losing a part of yourself and you're not.  You know.  Shut your mouth.  You're afraid you're going to lose a piece of yourself.  I think he thinks it's going to be too hard.  Like, he won't even try.  He's afraid.  He's afraid.  Terrified of losing that one last escape.  Why don't you put a patch on and do something healthier?  Get prostitutes.  Do anything that isn't going to have your, no offense.  Give your wife eggs. 
[03:07:30]  I don't care what it is.  I'm saying, you're going to take a piece of your jaw out.  What's the matter with you, dude?  I mean, if I could quit, I love to smoke.  I mean, you smoke more, but I loved it and I quit.  You could quit.  It doesn't bother him.  You know who bothers me?  Yeah.  It's like I see that commercial with the guy.  Oh, swabbing his throat.  Yeah.  Will you still be doing comedy when you have a voice box there?  I'll probably get on Last Comic 7 because they're using all handicaps anyhow.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Jesus Christ.  The one guy with the left crooked arm.  He's funny, though, man.  He is funny.  He is really funny, that dude. 
[03:08:00]  I want to tell you something.  Hey, we got to look into your future right here.  This is a look into Rich Boss' future.  Hi, I'm Rich Boss.  You want to buy a dryer?  Door.  I am my daughter, Money, and I'm dodging her.  Actually, she's dodging me.  She's disgusted at the vagina that is my throat now.  Oh, as he starts.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Laughing and then coughing.  Listen.  You've got to get off the cigarette.  We'll see when it happens, then you know.  Chris, what's going on?  Uh, not much.  How's it going, boy?  All right.  What do you got?  Listen to this.  Go ahead.  Well, Bob, I've never heard of anybody actually waking up in the middle of the night and craving  a cigarette.  That's pretty weird.  He's one of the most addicted people I've ever met, and he refuses to acknowledge the  fucking terror he feels at the discomfort of quitting smoking.  It's not as bad as you think. 
[03:09:00]  Just get the patch and drink a lot of water.  It's possible.  Stop.  It's just fear.  It's terror.  Our own Danny's not quitting.  Is he?  Derek, too.  Derek, too?  How's Danny doing with the smoking?  Oh, yeah.  Danny is quitting.  I've been smoking even through the military and stuff like that, and I've never, you know,  had to wake up in the middle of the night and have a cigarette.  A little lonely.  Two hours sleep.  A little lonely for Travis down there, downstairs, puffing away all by himself these days.  All by his lonesome.  He's standing there like fucking John Voight in Midnight Cowboy. 
[03:09:30]  Guy's just trying to get him to suck their dicks in a movie.  I don't do that.  That smoking fin shit is for Jackie's.  Robert in Birmingham.  Robert.  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  The problem is, Voss doesn't see any consequences of not stopping smoking.  I mean, cancer is just a theoretical thing.  Yes.  Bonnie just needs to tell him that she's going to leave his ass if he doesn't quit.  I tell him that every day.  Then he gives me $100.  And I wipe off her back. 
[03:10:00]  Tyler in Columbus.  Tyler.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey.  First of all, I want to welcome you guys back to the big wazoo.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Fuck the funny bones.  They wouldn't book me.  Where's the big wazoo?  Yeah, I've been there.  Columbus.  Oh, yeah.  Suckers.  Anyway, I just want to give Voss a little update on my father-in-law.  He got his jaw removed.  See, this doesn't bother him.  It bothers me.  I can't take him.  Why?  Did you know his father?  I know. 
[03:10:30]  I love that man.  Sorry.  I didn't hear that one, Bonnie.  That was a good one.  That was funny.  How is he feeling?  Well, you're not going to have all of me, are you?  What's that?  Okay.  Never mind.  And he's doing not too bad.  He slobbers all over himself.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  He's lost us already.  He's got about half his jaw.  Oh, God.  And they actually put it in, and the skin died and everything. 
[03:11:00]  And then they had to remove it and do it and start all over again.  Oh, God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah, I laughed too, man.  I used to smoke, and I said, you know, I don't give a shit because he, you know, he did what  he did, and he wouldn't quit smoking, and he's paying for it now.  So, that's...  Rich is just lying to the people he loves.  His wife and his daughters, who he loves.  He promises and promises, and he lies to their faces. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, how does this guy chew food now?  He actually has a tube inserted in his stomach, and he has a little cup attached to the end  of the tube, and he just pours his liquefied dinner into the tube.  Well, that sounds tasty.  Coconut shrimp in a blender.  Coconut shrimp in a blender.  Can you imagine?  Bonnie's going to be the one that has to take care of him like that.  Oh, yeah, dude.  You got to...  Isn't there such a thing as an intervention for swimming in?  Bonnie, could you blend me up?  Oh, gosh.  Bonnie... 
[03:12:00]  He's hard enough to look at.  Bonnie, could you blend me up some shrimp cocktail and pour it in my food?  Oh, God.  With a clear feed bag on the bottom so the drool and stuff leaks into it.  Oh.  I got to say this.  He can talk.  You can kind of understand him if he puts his finger over his trach tube.  Oh.  You see, you're going to lose your profession.  That means something to you.  Yeah, slobbery, dryer door, Jeff.  Without a jaw, old claw hammer face. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, too good, man.  Too good.  Can somebody call in?  Yeah.  I just...  I've been smoking and drinking my whole life.  I'll tell you how I got to 99 is smoking, drinking whiskey, and women.  So does your father-in-law try to look at the bright side like he's saving a lot on mock threes?  He's got to mock one and a half.  Oh, God.  That's right.  That's pretty pricey, though.  Grow a real long mustache to try to comb over. 
[03:13:00]  Like a walrus.  It looks like a beard.  Oh, you grow the old taft mustache.  Don't make a joke about it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look.  What the body's telling him?  Don't make a joke about it.  Yeah.  He's going to start joking about it.  You take it seriously.  We can joke about it.  Not you.  You can't scare someone into quitting, because Rich sees something that's never going to happen to him.  First of all, you don't think I'm going to quit at some point?  No.  No.  You've said it too many times. 
[03:13:30]  You just lied.  I didn't say it.  You lied.  I said it June 30th on my birthday.  Shut up.  You said that your last birthday.  Yeah.  And then you didn't even...  And you gave it 20 minutes.  You said five and a half weeks ago.  Yeah.  You've been saying it.  There's a guy that decided to do it.  Five and a half...  Well, let's talk to Rich.  Rich in New York.  Go ahead.  What's your story?  I quit the same day Rich was supposed to quit live on the air.  I've been wearing the patch for five and a half weeks.  Now, Voss, you've got kids.  Fucking quit.  How hard was it?  If you don't, you're going to quit someday, the day they plant dirt in your face. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, you don't think I'm going to be able to afford a box?  Is that what you're saying?  I didn't see that coming.  Save your curtain tops.  Danny, I haven't asked him lately, but Danny quit smoking?  Yeah.  Are you still...  How are you doing with that?  Doing all right with it.  Cool, man.  How long?  Just over two weeks.  Cold turkey or you got a patch?  No, I got the patch.  It works, right?  It helps.  It absolutely helps.  Do you drink or smoke pot or anything?  Do you have any addictions?  Well, I was drinking a lot more when I was smoking.  You put the patch on your balls, right? 
[03:14:30]  No.  Put it over your asshole.  Got it on right now.  Oh, there it is.  I was showing Rich before.  He's like, does it work?  Of course it works.  Don't wait.  First of all, you fucking clipboard jockey, don't you ever try to abuse me, okay?  You jackass.  You get me coffee when I tell you, okay?  That's what you do with me.  Let me see it.  Let me see it on that one.  Turn around.  Now, what do you put on?  One or two a day?  Just one.  Yeah?  How much did you smoke?  How long did you smoke for?  I was smoking for 10 years. 
[03:15:00]  He's trying to show you that you don't understand his dilemma because he smokes more and has  been smoking longer.  That's why he's asking.  Do you wear it in the shower?  Because I shower.  You can wear it in the shower as a matter of fact.  Of course you can.  Wouldn't that be odd if you got a little circular cancer of the arm?  Yeah.  And it spread and paralyzed you and we all just laughed?  Why do you put it there when you have so much room on your forehead to put it?  You fucking...  Misplaced anger!  Rich, you're going to want to replace the smoking with something.  I'm going to suggest a lot of fruit and veggies for you. 
[03:15:30]  That was your comeback?  Yes.  Listen to me, fucking Green Goblin from Spider-Man face.  What did that mean?  It means that he's fucking chubby.  I'm chubby?  He's chubby!  You can't take that, Rich!  What?  I'm chubby?  Let's see.  Show him your abs, Rich.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Rich is the fucking...  You look fat with clothes and skinny without it.  I've never seen that before.  I'm fucking 49 years old and I'm ripped, okay?  His gut looks better.  His gut looks much better.  Those are tumors. 
[03:16:00]  All the less that the surgeons are going to have to cut through to get to your lungs.  You're just lucky they form into something.  I had the sack taken out of the back of my ear if you want to see the sneakers.  Oh, God, no.  No, we don't.  All right.  Danny's doing well with it.  Good for you, Danny.  Let's play the throat cancer commercials again.  And they horrify Bonnie, right?  Do I look fat?  Do I look fat?  This guy is...  Oh, Jesus, you woman.  This guy is on every time you turn the TV on now.  It's the Spanish guy.  They show him getting ready in the morning. 
[03:16:30]  He swabs out his blowhole with a Q-tip.  And it's unwatchable.  Unwatchable.  And now they have a new one where he walks around a pool and talks about how he used to  enjoy swimming.  And now if he went into the pool, he would drown.  Yeah, but see, here's the thing.  This guy was a spot welder, but now he's doing TV.  So...  Yeah, he's a career move.  He's seeing it as an upward career move.  You think he's happy that he gets recognized, like, all happy? 
[03:17:00]  Hey, you're a cancer guy.  Sign my hole.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What are you coming over to look at?  To distract from the fact that you just bombed?  I've had some good ones today.  I might have one or two bad ones.  Oh, you had a couple of real zingers.  You could have the patch on right now, just drinking water, and when you jones, it goes away.  All right, here's...  It goes away.  Here's the second...  Oh, God.  ...cancer kazoo commercial.  Yes.  I was born on an island where a woman was a way to life. 
[03:17:30]  I never thought that anything could hit me from the water.  Then I go through cancer from a smoking cigarette and lost my voice.  Now I have to think to a hole in my throat.  If water gets inside it, it will drown me.  Oh, I used to love swimming.  I used to love swimming.  I used to love swimming.  He's not good on a rap.  Like...  How come we blew him up last night?  Some hip-hop. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, that was our cow.  We quit smoking.  No, I think the joke is he's still smoking.  Yeah, he's still smoking.  That's the one.  Yeah, Rich, you gotta stop.  I'm gonna.  I'm telling you.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You stopped giving you nothing.  We've given you a month and a year.  I've been hearing this to you for a year.  I remember when Rich quit for six months.  Shut up.  Years ago, he quit for six months.  Yeah.  Yes.  When I was still smoking.  You can do it.  I still don't believe that, by the way.  You weren't with him all the time.  No, but I believe you.  I don't think you would have lied.  I bet he was... 
[03:18:30]  I mean, he's a groveling nothing, but he's not really a liar.  He's been lying about quitting.  No, I've been in denial.  I haven't been lying.  No, you had to lie.  What's the difference?  You're lying to your wife and children that you're gonna do something that you know you're  not gonna do.  I didn't tell my kids I was quitting.  I might have told her.  You've got kids?  I don't know.  Bonnie's killing today.  That's right.  She's funny, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you, Rich.  Would you just pull out a cigarette?  No, my money's slipped.  Oh.  Why don't you just throw your cigarettes out?  Throw them out right now.  Why don't you just tough it out? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, let's do it.  Yeah, throw them right now.  What's the worst that's gonna happen?  What's the worst that's gonna happen?  Yeah.  Nothing's worse that's gonna happen.  You'll live through it.  I mean...  So what are you saying?  Stop being so afraid.  I'll quit.  Just throw them away.  Okay.  No, not one more.  That was what I did.  He did.  He had one more.  I had one more that day.  You're gonna have one more, and you're gonna quit today.  Yes, it is.  I did.  I quit on Friday night going to the cellar.  I had to perform.  I did three shows that night.  He needs a perfect time and place to quit.  Yeah, what?  Do you want to wake up one day and just want to be cigarette-free?  No. 
[03:19:30]  Shut up.  It's never gonna happen.  Esty took me over.  Remember, I did three sets that night, you could still smoke in the cellar, and she  took me over, and I just put the patch on.  You did three sets?  Yeah.  Not all in your face.  No.  I don't know.  I'll quit today.  See, I think you should even just, I mean, get a patch, get hypnotized, get some gum.  Is it good?  You know, do all of it.  Everything at once.  Yeah, just do it.  I mean, whatever it takes to help you quit.  Then when I quit, then you guys are gonna have nothing on me.  Oh, well.  No, we'll still have plenty.  You'll still have a little pee-pee. 
[03:20:00]  No.  He doesn't.  He has a...  Rich has a great cock.  Almost done.  Rich has a great cock.  His wife is right there, and Jim's gotta vouch for Rich's cock.  He carries photos of it.  Yeah, no shit.  It's great that you and Bonnie have something to bond with.  I mean, we've unfortunately all seen his picture.  Yeah, hey, this is Rich Voss.  You can go to my website, richvoss.com.  That's richvoss.com, my website.  And MySpace, you know, how do you... 
[03:20:30]  What is that MySpace stuff there?  Slash, slash, MySpace, Rich Voss.  You know, however you do it on MySpace, that's how you do it.  Because I'm there, too.  MySpace.  But my website, richvoss.com.  Thank you.  The History Channel and Jimmy Dean's Sausage Links,  with a grant from the Picket Fence Dental Corporation,  present 20th Century American History,  with renowned scholar and member of Mensa, Rich Voss.  I know a lot about it.  Dr. Voss will take you on a breathtaking journey 
[03:21:00]  through history's most poignant milestones.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  The Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  With every outburst, Rich Voss gets dumber and dumber.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when...  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  Your head will spin.  Who was the U.S. president when World War II ended? 
[03:21:30]  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  That didn't actually end World War II.  You've never met a Jew who knows less about World War II than Rich Voss.  What was the World War where Germany was going and taking, you know, just out of control?  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  It's pretty embarrassing when you think about it.  So tune in to 20th century American history and watch in amazement as an old Jewish man goes from mildly coherent to babbling pile of mush in the course of an hour. 
[03:22:00]  You know, it's all history from now.  Coming to the History Channel.  Obi and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian...  Ralphie Mae.  I don't even know what is on these discs.  We'll just throw it in and see what happens.  What is it?  It's your brother's tribute band.  Oh!  Like a potluck thing.  Yeah.  Which songs?  I don't know.  This is Journey.  Let's hear.  Any way you want it, that's the way you need it. 
[03:22:30]  Any way you want it.  I was alone.  I never knew what good luck would do.  I knew that we'd touch.  Then we sang.  Oh, I was a lonely.  Oh, I might say.  Yeah, Hugo.  Unbelievable.  He looks just like Steve Perry, too.  It's amazing.  It's a hard time.  A hard time. 
[03:23:00]  Baby, hold time.  So, anyway you want it, that's the way you need it.  Anyway you want it.  Hey, what do you do back in Boys Town?  Anyway you want it, that's the way you need it.  That's unbelievable.  Fantastic.  That's pretty good.  You'll be hearing that at the downtown tonight in Farmingdale with your pals Opie and Anthony.  Live.  I don't remember this one.  I'm trying to get a real big hit.  Get a hit. 
[03:23:30]  How about Open Arms?  I don't have a track listing.  We're just guessing.  How about Open Arms, Opie?  And that's your brother.  And he didn't even know how to play Journey.  He told me that he learned this in like a weekend.  Yeah, sounds just like him.  Let me get one hit here.  Ralphie Mae, you're yelling and screaming through the glass there. 
[03:24:00]  I'm yelling and screaming.  He's a busy guy?  You're a busy guy now?  That you're a big TV star?  Shut up.  I want like lights or a hit.  How about Open Arms?  Something soft.  Couple skate, ladies and gentlemen.  Come on.  Couple skate.  Yeah.  Shoot the duck if you're out there, baby.  Shoot the duck.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, a little Journey.  Taking you right back.  Oh, yeah.  This is a graduation weekend.  Taking your year.  What was this, 1980 or something?  It was a hot year, baby.  Come on.  It's unbelievable.  Sounds just like him.  You got to see the guy, what he looks like.  He looks just like Steve Perry did back then. 
[03:25:00]  Amazing.  Wait for the chorus.  Then we'll cut it off.  All right.  Because they got all those Journey harmonies down.  This is a tribute band.  Isn't that amazing?  Really?  It's Ant's brother's band.  Yeah, playing tonight.  These guys are a tribute band for Journey?  I know.  I know.  Isn't that sad? 
[03:25:30]  Yikes.  Yikes.  He also has a U2 tribute band.  Wow.  And he's traveling all over the country now.  Actually, he's going to go to Ireland to do the U2 thing.  You have to see the difference in crowds, though.  When you go to the Journey one, it's all these old broads.  Old broads and mullets.  And the old broads are wearing the mullets, which is really scary.  The mullet.  Very rare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the women wear these stretch pants.  Nice.  And the guys are wearing, like, the parachute pants with the zippers on them. 
[03:26:00]  And the white sleeveless shirt with a Chinese letter on it.  And the parking lot is just chock full of rusted-out Camaros.  Yeah, baby.  You're living the dream.  Burgundy Camaros with a black door.  Yeah, the fucking T-top leaks, but it's hot.  It's fucking cherry.  I'm telling you.  That fucking stuck.  I got the Kragers on there.  That exhaust ain't stuck.  Let me tell you that much.  Remember Capizio shoes?  Fuck.  It's fucking awful Dago footwear. 
[03:26:30]  It's so weird to come on a show that you don't have to put the brakes on.  Like, if you feel like dropping a cunt, you can do it easily.  It's so bizarre.  It's like being shackled and, uh, I'm free?  We're finally free.  I'm free?  We're free!  Truly the only medium.  You said we're free?  The only medium we could be on.  I can't imagine going on any other regular radio now after this.  No.  We're ruined.  This has ruined us.  The only way you want to do an FCC-friendly show is if you do, like, a free play league 
[03:27:00]  or something like that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  We'll take that suggestion and not do anything about it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So we're gonna be, uh, checking out the bands tonight at, uh, the downtown in Farmingdale.  Yeah.  Oh, love needs a fire.  Sounds just like Journey.  Where's open arms?  I'm trying to find it.  Oh, love needs a fire.  And the girls, like, hold up lighters. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, they think it's 1982.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  They're all wearing too much makeup for how old they are now.  This is sad.  Yeah.  It's quite a little blast of nostalgia.  Yeah.  I like a good tribute band.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they're good.  Yeah.  I did a radio call-in show, and they had a Creed, uh, tribute band.  Like, the tribute band for Creed.  Right?  And I was like, you know, I liked Creed's early shit when it was called Pearl Jam. 
[03:28:00]  They fucking suck up there.  They're singing for Jesus.  You're getting, using Jesus to get pussy?  That's kind of like, I don't know.  You know, it just creeps me out a little.  You can't do that.  You fucking, and can the guy make one video where he's not on the cliff?  And how about buttoning your fucking shirt, you fucking loser?  And they're there, and they're, I'm cracking them.  I'm fucking, I don't know them.  They're setting me up, right?  And they go, hey, we're here with the number one, uh, Creed tribute band.  I'm like, hey, Greg, go outside and fucking kill yourselves. 
[03:28:30]  You suck.  What are you doing?  You're, you're, you're covering a cover band.  They're fucking a Pearl Jam cover band.  That's all they are.  And, and they're the guys that actually sued Creed for damage to their career when the  lead singer was getting drunk and passing out on stage.  Hysterical.  That's great.  Well, I have a tribute band to a band that's.  Like, shitty.  Out there still.  Right.  And kind of relatively new, if you, if you think about, like.  And shitty.  And shitty.  Yeah.  And, well, it could be shitty if it's old shitty, because they're a. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, yeah, that's great.  You know, they're a cover bands from, you could go on these tribute websites.  It's hysterical.  It's every band that was ever out there.  Yeah, every band.  And they try to get those clever little names.  There's like Neil Diamond ones.  America.  Yeah.  Sabra Kadabra is very good.  Sabra Kadabra.  They're the best.  You know what we want to do?  I think the best is Trent.  Isn't that an Abba tribute band?  Trent Zeppelin.  No, they're a Black Sabbath.  Yeah, there you go.  Know what we want to do?  And maybe we can throw the word out now.  And all those tribute bands that are listening to us right now.  Or if you know of a tribute band, tell them to send the stuff into the radio show.  We want to do Battle of the Tribute Bands. 
[03:29:30]  We'll play it.  Yeah.  And then we'll do a Battle of the Tribute Bands.  These guys are all lunatics, too.  Like some of them, they really think they're the person.  They're kooks.  They live the life like the person.  There's these, you know, Doors Tribute Bands where the guy walks around thinking he's Jim Morrison.  Yeah.  I'm going to smack him in the head.  Doesn't bathe.  We'll get some kind of contest going.  Could you kill yourself then?  Do the part of it and really complete the whole thing?  Yeah, right.  Oh, you found some U2? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, this is the other band playing tonight.  Well, it's your brother's band, too.  Yeah.  Just a different lineup.  How he goes from a Journey Tribute Band to a U2 Tribute Band.  He puts on the Indian headdress and does YMCA.  Oh, man.  He was always my favorite.  Philippe Rose.  The U2 band is getting gigs all over the country, though.  These guys are busy every weekend.  Every weekend.  Bunch of drunk Irish want to see this band. 
[03:30:30]  The recording of this isn't as good as the Journey stuff.  But it's good.  The guy's got all the Bono moves.  Oh, no.  It's great.  It's great.  It should be a lot of fun.  Tonight at the downtown with your pals in Farmingdale.  I think it starts at what?  Eight?  I'll get down there at eight.  All right.  Cool.  He's got us.  Ralphie Mayen's studio playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Yeah.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Two shows on Friday.  Three on Saturday.  One on Thanksgiving. 
[03:31:00]  Eight o'clock.  Yeah.  You've got to work on Thanksgiving, man.  Oh, it's okay.  Please.  It's all right.  Anything to get away from relatives.  It's phenomenal.  What an excuse.  I mean, I use that excuse why I couldn't come to Thanksgiving lunch.  I got a show and the traffic and the parade.  I was making up anything.  You just don't like hanging with your family?  Not mine.  It's my girlfriend's family.  Yeah, right?  You got to do that thing, huh?  Yeah.  What's the problem with the girlfriend family? 
[03:31:30]  They hate me.  Why?  Because I'm not Jewish, I'm fat, and I'm a comic.  Well, you're not as fat as you used to be.  Right.  You lost a lot of weight.  Right, right.  You lost a ton of weight.  I know.  I've lost a Norton.  Like 220 pounds?  Close.  200 pounds.  I'm not that heavy.  I was giving you the 200.  200.  Jesus.  I just told you.  I paid him a compliment.  I go, I go.  If you lost a Norton, you would have lost 165 pounds of mediocrity, which is what I am.  Then I lost that, baby. 
[03:32:00]  I lost that.  But I came in, and I go, Jimmy, you don't look as creepy as normal.  What's going on?  He goes, I'm not feeling good.  It's like I'm off my creepiness.  Did you do the stomach staple, right?  Yeah, I did it almost a year ago.  Almost a year ago.  And last year, it was the day before Thanksgiving, and the doctor was like, are you sure you want  to do this the day before Thanksgiving?  I go, I'm caught up on fucking Thanksgiving.  Trust me.  Wow.  I've done my damage.  Thanksgiving is probably happy that I'm fucking taking this one off. 
[03:32:30]  You know, I did a lot of damage at Thanksgiving.  This year, not so much.  So what can you eat every day if you have that staple?  About a cup full.  That's it?  I went with Voss to Ruby Foods yesterday after watching him do Carolines.  One little Voss handful full of food?  Yeah, right?  A little midget handful of food.  A little non-bending turtle feet hands.  His awful fingers.  His stiff hands for a little man.  Oh, they're so small.  He cracks me up. 
[03:33:00]  Little baby feet hands.  He's so funny.  He cracked me up last night.  That's cool.  Hey, you're a sports fan, aren't you?  Yeah, big time.  What's your thoughts on the fight?  We've been talking about the fight for days.  I mean, I've fucking enough already.  What do you expect?  Artest is a fucking thug.  Detroit is a fucking thug town.  You take this thug to that thug town, and you're shocked when there's a fucking fight.  Are you retarded?  I'm surprised they lasted the whole series last year without a fucking fight.  That's what's shocking. 
[03:33:30]  And Artest goes to the crowd and beats the shit out of the wrong white dude.  Because, you know, they all look alike, those white guys.  And then there was some black guy just pummeling the shit out of the back of his head.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Fucking great.  I can't get it out.  And then that one guy, Artest, like, punches him.  And then, like, he, you know, the guy who just stands up.  And then out of nowhere, bam!  Jermaine, yeah.  Drops his ass.  I was like, nice.  It's a sliding punch.  Nice. 
[03:34:00]  Nice maneuver.  Did you see the kid in the jersey that looked like Robert Kelly get punched in the face?  Yeah, that's who I'm talking about.  That's who I'm talking about.  That fat idiot can belt him right in the mouth.  Robert Kelly.  Didn't he?  Robert Kelly.  Didn't look like him.  I lost respect for Robert Kelly when he told me he shaves his taint.  I'm like, really?  Really?  Yeah, it's just, uh.  Whoa.  Yeah, right?  See, I'm glad I'm not the only one who lost respect.  Why?  He shave his whole sack and everything?  I guess.  I don't know.  He told me he shaves his taint.  There's only two types of people that do that.  The porn star and the gay man. 
[03:34:30]  Well, no, no.  I'll tell you.  Maybe Bob can tell this story better than all, but I'll tell it real quick.  There was a time he was getting his ass eaten, and he told me about this, and he must have  had a little piece of toilet paper in there.  This is completely true.  And because he heard the girl, like, when she was eating his ass, go.  That's probably why he shaves his taint.  All right.  Filthy Dominican.  Oh, God.  There's nothing back there.  Like, you can't assume that if she's doing that and you hear that sound that she's choking  on a Jolly Rancher. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, right?  You know, you really got to assume it's something that was on you.  That's just a dirty, dirty woman.  Yes.  That's a dirty woman that did it, and...  She doesn't have some jaw that she's trying to get into the spittoon.  I got to be honest with you.  The New York comics are way more depraved than the L.A. comics, and I respect them for  that.  You know?  I just respect that.  You're right about that.  The New York comics are really disturbed.  They're really, really are.  You know?  Present company included.  Yeah.  Oh, we know about him.  He's the king.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  Ugh.  I sit back and write notes.  I was like, wow.  I think it's honestly that a lot of guys in L.A.  A lot of guys in L.A. I'm sure are funny guys come from New York, but I think a lot  of them are just because the industry is so prevalent out there, you can't do a set  without worrying that somebody's in the audience, so it kind of, I think, it cuts down on  creativity because people are so afraid of bombing in front of the head of Fox or whoever  might show up.  Or ruin your whole career.  I do the cellar every night for the last eight years.  No one's ever seen me in there.  It's fine.  It's what I want.  It's where I want to work out.  Yeah.  Best club in New York, and there's never industry in there.  I think it's the best club in the country, to be honest with you.  It's my favorite. 
[03:36:00]  The low ceilings and the tight crowds.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Let's say hi to Jason in Toledo, Ohio.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What girl wants to wow?  Hi.  What's that?  Wait, this girl wants to wow?  Wow.  Really?  She's terrific.  Will she come in and do that?  We'd love that.  Jason, hold on a minute.  Holy mackerel.  We've got three really hot girls that have just been sitting, staring at us for the last  hour and a half.  And they're coming into the studio now.  They're friends of Ziggy, right?  We work for Ziggy. 
[03:36:30]  You work for Ziggy?  You work for Ziggy?  What do you guys do for Ziggy?  We work at my radio store.  My radio store?  Yeah.  Holly mackerel.  You're Ziggy's girlfriend, right?  No, that would be her.  Oh, you're Ziggy's girlfriend.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  That's Aunt Angela.  So Norton, she's off limits.  I know.  That's why I had to ask, because I've been leering at all of them, but now I feel guilty.  I apologize.  Hey, where did the top of your pants go?  They seem to have lost the top of your pants, these kids.  I paid more so they'd cut it off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We like those type of jeans.  You sound like, remember on Justice for All, the old guy whose wife got mugged? 
[03:37:00]  This is a punishment?  Probation?  He just wanted her money.  She wouldn't let go of hers.  So what do you guys do for Ziggy?  We all work at my radio store in Brooklyn.  And we're actually having a sticker stop there in a couple weeks.  So please stop on by.  All right.  We'll have the info up on opianthony.com.  In Brooklyn, huh?  Yeah.  How do you like that trip in on the Gowanus?  Isn't that fun?  The fucking traffic.  I'm so glad I moved out to Long Island. 
[03:37:30]  In the nice community I live in now.  Oh, yeah.  Now all the cameras come in.  You see this, Ralphie?  Yeah, right?  Can you blame them?  Now they come in here.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Creepy little stand.  Don't they know I'm a C celebrity?  Maybe a D celebrity?  Come on.  Now you're at least a B minus now.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  If you turn up on network TV on a couple of different shows, you're pretty much in.  Is that you underwater on that one show?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I got to call you out on that.  Horrific.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What show?  When you jump in the pool, they have an underwater cam of Ralphie jumping in the pool. 
[03:38:00]  No one looks good underwater.  No.  Being filmed.  I didn't have no control over that.  What was that show?  It's called Celebrity Fit Club.  It starts in January.  It's fat celebrities lose weight.  Right.  But they show you underwater.  I'm not even talking about the fat.  It's just something with water.  Cage goes in the water.  Ralphie Mae's in the water.  Oh, Ralphie Mae.  Farewell and adieu to your first tennis lady.  Saw Ralphie Mae eat a rocking chair once.  I don't want to staple Ralphie's stomach and have that Kintner voice all over the operating  table. 
[03:38:30]  It's definitely an unflattering piece of video of you.  Well, you know, I'm there to lose weight, so they're paying me a lot of money to do it.  Ralphie Mae can't stay down with three barrels in him.  Not three.  We're going to need a bigger stage.  Wait till the taxidermy man sees what I've brung him.  It's the best, man. 
[03:39:00]  The girl wants to wow, Anthony.  I understand.  Yeah, but he's on a roll.  These are actually great fat jokes.  I'm really disappointed in most other fat jokes.  This is phenomenal.  Yeah, when Ralphie Mae's eyes roll back white, lifeless eyes like a dog's eyes.  Let's drink to your staples.  Looks at the buffet.  Tears it to pieces.  Man comes by, tries to clear the buffet, says time's over, but Ralphie Mae keeps coming back  and just pounding and pounding. 
[03:39:30]  Sometimes he goes away.  Sometimes Ralphie doesn't go away.  Oh boy, he's here for his noon feeding.  Saw roast beef on the buffet once.  Went to poke at it to get a piece.  It just bobbed upside down.  Ralphie Mae bit it in half.  I'll never go to the buffet again. 
[03:40:00]  In the buffet Indianapolis.  Sorry.  All right, wowing.  Yeah.  Wow, these girls are beautiful.  What's your name?  Anna.  Wow, you girls take care of yourself.  Yeah, they sure do, Anthony.  Do they work out or something?  Three beautiful brunettes.  We have a workout in the morning before we begin stocking the shelves.  Phenomenal.  How tall are you?  Look at the abs.  5'6".  Got the abs working.  The low riding jeans. 
[03:40:30]  And move your hands.  Wow.  Very nice.  Brave old.  Bravo.  Really, really.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Lovely.  We'll have that up on opns.  Yeah.  Look at Steve.  You betcha.  I gotta be honest.  What?  He's got an all over tan.  I know great tits.  I've got a pair.  Those are phenomenal tits.  They really are.  She knows it, too.  She's not shy about it.  I would have loved to have seen more, but, you know, Eric's arm is more important. 
[03:41:00]  Eric, Ant would like to see.  I've been staring at Eric's arm the whole time.  How old are you?  32.  Wow.  Wow.  You're out of your mind.  Really?  Wow.  Obviously, don't look 30.  Your boyfriend must love those.  Great way to.  Feel that one out, Jim.  Back door to her.  Her boyfriend slash husband must love those.  Oh, they're fantastic.  She said she's single.  What?  She's single.  She is single?  Ooh. 
[03:41:30]  That just changes the whole perspective on the show.  By the way, folks, I'm at Caroline's through this awkward silence this weekend.  I know.  We're all like, uh.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Never?  Well, everyone gets a mild flow.  Never married?  Never married.  What's the problem there?  She likes girls.  Is that it?  No.  There's got to be an issue that you're 30 what?  Two.  32.  32 and you're not married.  Usually, it either means the girl really is into her career or she's a cunt. 
[03:42:00]  No, I'm not saying you are.  I'm just a man.  Thank you for the big cock lock.  Because of the voice kill.  I'm in no danger.  I hate that word.  Why else are girls that age and not married?  Isn't there supposed to be an alert before that word?  Yeah, I know.  I went right in there without the C-word alert.  I'll vouch for a fella.  She's not a tedious bitch.  She's cool.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  You know, just in case it comes out again.  All right.  What?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert.  C-word alert. 
[03:42:30]  Warning.  Warning.  All right.  So now the ladies know that the C-word might fly during this second.  I won't say it again.  I'm just saying that a lot of times if a girl is-  Did you hear what he called you?  No, I didn't.  I said if a girl is that age, it means now you must be maybe career oriented.  I just keep meeting the wrong guys.  The wrong guys.  Where are you looking?  Brooklyn?  No.  Hey, yeah.  You Russian?  No, I'm Greek.  Greek.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  Do you speak Greek? 
[03:43:00]  Yes, I do.  Can we hear something?  Steve, we can use her for a promo.  That's a little joke.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Can you say something?  Can you say something sexy in Greek?  Dude.  What's sexy in Greek?  Can you not cover your nipples, please?  Yeah.  It's the hair that's covering it, which is making it very sexy.  Hey, Jim, what's that liquid you're dumping in the white hanky?  I don't know what to say, guys.  It's too much pressure.  No, you can say anything.  We don't-  Ask Jimmy if he wants to play Monster Rain in Greek. 
[03:43:30]  No, it wouldn't translate well.  It wouldn't translate well.  Us, say, we Greeks like doing it in the ass.  No?  That's the stereotype or the rumor.  Yeah.  Rumor has it.  Just say anything.  Go ahead.  Let me see it.  How about, no, I would not like to go out to dinner with you, because that's what I'm  going to want to hear anyway.  I'd like to hear it in Greek first, for my pathetic attempt at hitting on you later.  Ah, if you're hungry, I could eat.  You are the worst. 
[03:44:00]  I'm a just-  I saw you work at that blonde yesterday.  You're-  Oh, I'm terrible.  I mean, I live here.  If you want to come in for coffee.  You turn into a different person.  It's hilarious.  I got it.  Same mashed potatoes, too early.  Piece and carrots, too early.  Anything.  Oh, God, I'm just-  Anything.  I can't even-  How about, I'm really hungry.  Be now.  Hmm?  Be now.  Be now?  Mm-hmm.  That's it?  Yeah, that's it.  That's all we get?  The Greek's cut to the point, those hairy-chepted savages. 
[03:44:30]  Wait, now!  All right, here.  Can you say, um, what do you do, Medina?  Huh?  Wait, she speaks it, too?  Yeah, she speaks it.  So then you do it.  Sisters.  You guys are sisters?  Yeah.  Wow.  How hot is that?  Are your kids as great as hers?  I mean, no offense, but I mean, those are phenomenal.  That's like, not every day.  Can you take my shirt, too?  Yeah.  I mean, on disrespect, I'm just saying.  Can you take your shirt off, too, and then just start kissing your sister?  Whoa, whoa.  What did I say?  What happened?  You promised I could jerk off on his face! 
[03:45:00]  I've been waiting for that for a while.  It hasn't happened yet.  No?  No.  We're Greek, but that's the men, as I hear us.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  The men like that.  And how old are you?  Wait a minute.  Isn't Lesbos an island in the group?  Lesbos?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  We travel to Lesbos.  All right, say something for us.  Say something sexy.  Either one.  I had it, and then I lost it, so.  Say, get your cock out!  Can you do that?  I think you just did it for us. 
[03:45:30]  Just say hello, we'll interpret it as that.  Wow.  Give me a line, I'll say it.  All right.  Get your cock out.  This bed's going nowhere, ladies and gentlemen.  I know.  Why do people get nervous on me?  I can't know those words.  Wow.  The tits are phenomenal, but the hamster is very stinking.  Say, Ralphie's got the best tits I've ever seen.  Can you say that?  O Ralphie έχει τα καλύτερα βυζιά που έχουμε δει.  Right.  Right on.  Say that again.  Hey, all right.  Now I'm filming.  O Ralphie έχει τα καλύτερα βυζιά που έχουμε δει. 
[03:46:00]  Nice.  Wow.  They have sexy voices.  We need them in a promo.  You'll be following Steve in a few minutes.  Thank you, Flower.  Don't worry, he's harmless.  He looks scary, but he won't touch you.  We had a little talk with him behind the scenes, and he won't be touching any girls anymore.  No, I'm just kidding.  That's a joke.  No, I just need you to open your taint.  Right.  It's for a promo.  Right.  What does that have to do with anything?  Trust me.  I just need to brand your ass with the Foundry music logo.  Everything is property of Foundry. 
[03:46:30]  See, this is the problem with our radio show.  The hotter the boobs, the worse the radio gets, because we just get dumbfounded.  Right, exactly.  I would just like to tell the listeners that Eric, when she came in, moved the mic down  to her boobs as though they were going to talk.  That's all right.  That's what we're trying to think at times.  You know what?  We're stupid.  You're a good man here.  All right.  That's a smart move.  I hate to say it, but we've got to get the ladies out, because we need to do good radio  for our listeners.  It kills me to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I can't talk with them.  Thank you, gentlemen.  But if you guys want to hang out topless outside, give us a traditional Greek farewell. 
[03:47:00]  Yes, sis.  Yeah?  Yes, sis.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We could go eat or something.  There's two hotter chicks waiting outside, a lady named Di.  Oh, yeah.  The retard of Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, wait, wait.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal body.  Completely nailed it.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Oh, yeah.  She's fantastic.  Beautiful.  I have no shot at dinner with her.  I'm such a depression.  Perfect body.  Dark hair, dark eyes, small boobs. 
[03:47:30]  Beautiful.  Perfect shape boobs.  But great, yeah.  Phenomenal.  We've said it on the show a million times.  It's not all about the big boobs.  Not at all.  Nah.  Poe's working on it.  I can't compete with him.  Talking there with his towel.  All right.  We'll have that up on opianthony.com.  Master Poe is working his moves on her.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's got the towel around him.  What's his real name?  Master Poe.  Nobody knows?  No.  He's a trained killer.  That's what I've heard.  He really is.  Yeah, so I don't want to give him any static.  Ben, what's Master Poe doing out there? 
[03:48:00]  Look at him with the towel around his neck.  He looks like he just got done beating someone up.  What is he doing?  He's working him.  Can you blame him?  He is totally working the picture.  I can't compete with that.  He's newly divorced.  His great jawline.  He's ready to go.  Very handsome fella.  There's also a problem with...  Well, there's a problem with your mic because people aren't paying attention today again.  Who's mic?  Is your mic on now?  Now it's on.  All right.  Marion caused a disturbance outside.  They were just yelling and screaming, so I think...  What's going on, Master Poe?  Master Poe, are you working?  Are you losing control out there, Master Poe? 
[03:48:30]  No, actually, I'm not.  Just give me one second.  Well, you can have all the time you want.  I'm not going to tell you anything.  Play his music again while he gets his headphones.  I don't think the music is fine.  And what happened is I heard that they were yelling at the intern, at Dan, Danny.  And I went outside and I told him, I said, look, you'll have to wait out here.  When I have the time to bring you in, I will.  But in the meantime, just be patient.  Don't yell, don't scream.  Patience they have none of.  Don't yell, don't scream, and do not harass anyone here. 
[03:49:00]  You can take out their voice boxes, right?  In like a second.  Pretty much.  It's pretty easy.  He woke up a comatose guy yesterday with a couple drops to the ear.  I know, Mr. Miyagi taught him that.  A couple water drops to the ear.  Woke that guy up.  That was amazing.  I've seen him catch a fly with chopsticks sitting at the table.  Well, there's certain parts of your body there.  And what were you saying to the hot Greek women after they left?  Yeah, were you working it?  No, I asked her, Paul.  Were you working it?  You're newly divorced.  No, actually.  There are French benefits with this radio show.  Yeah, there are many French benefits. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Did I say French benefits?  Did I really say that?  French benefits.  Sucky.  I really need to sleep the next three days.  She was very nervous.  I love her.  She was extremely nervous.  And I told her, I said, I would stay by you if that would be more comfortable.  Yeah.  That's exactly what you say to the fat chicks that come by, too.  Yeah, I never saw you standing by anyone over 130.  I'm sure 190-pound girls get nervous.  I'm sure Lady Di's very nervous.  Why don't you go comfort her, too?  Lady Di looks like she shaved her face.  She has a 5 o'clock shadow on half her awful face. 
[03:50:00]  Like Fred Flintstone?  Just got that perma shadow?  Dude, it's just awful.  Yeah.  All right.  What's with the towel, Master Poe?  That's the last question for you today.  You really want to know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  What happened now?  No, nothing.  Can it be used as a weapon in the locker room?  This story doesn't end with another bloody gi in a dumpster, does it?  No.  All right, good.  Now, this kid, this is, uh, this could be used as a weapon.  The towel.  Could you demonstrate on Ralphie?  No.  Hey, what's that? 
[03:50:30]  I'm going to put on a comedy show.  Could you demonstrate on Ralphie?  You can use the towel as a weapon.  An ordinary towel.  If you ask, Marcelino would come in.  Because, honestly, anyone that demonstrates with me, they'll get hurt.  All right.  I'm going to see how he can use a towel.  Yeah, why not?  An ordinary towel as a weapon.  This is better than taking a stupid commercial break.  Get him in here.  Does he mind it?  I've got to be honest with you.  When I was, uh, like, 13, 14, 15, I had a ceramic towel that, uh, honestly could do  a lot of damage from, uh, all those batches. 
[03:51:00]  You know, I had a ceramic sock and ceramic closet.  It stands up by itself in the corner.  It could be used as a biological weapon.  The towel was pregnant.  I had the whack-off sock under my bed.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, the real stiff one?  Oh, yeah.  Like a croquet mallet?  All right, so what's going to happen here, Anthony?  We got, uh, Steve from opianthony.com.  He's going to film this demonstration.  What is that stick you have that thing on?  That's really...  That's a monopod.  It's a monopod.  I never heard of it.  It steadies the camera without the, uh...  Oh, okay.  Exactly. 
[03:51:30]  Cool.  So you can lower the thing down and rest it on one little foot.  All right.  Hence, mono.  Mono.  Ah, as in one.  Right.  Very good.  Good thing you only have...  Let it go.  It would have bombed.  It would have bombed.  I was trying to say, too, but you don't have one nucleosis.  Oh, really bad.  That's why I dropped it.  Good.  Anthony.  Good drop.  We got a guy warming up in the studio in the corner there.  What's his name again?  Here we go.  Masolino.  He's only been working for us for eight weeks.  Now, listen.  That's one of those names.  Does he mind doing these demonstrations?  No.  He gets hurt every time you do it, though.  Once again, if anyone else does a demonstration with me, they will get hurt. 
[03:52:00]  He kind of knows.  He will not get hurt because he's been training.  You're going to show us how an ordinary bath towel can be used as a weapon.  Before I do that, just forgive me.  I need to warm up, and it'll take a couple of seconds, and then I'll show you the towel.  All right.  You can take the headphones off.  Give Ralphie Mae the mic back.  Ralphie, this is the real deal.  Yeah, this guy's like a killer.  No, he really is.  He's a trained killer.  He's like a spooky dude.  He's like, you know, the guys you...  That is very spooky.  Just go, you know?  I'm sorry.  All right.  I will attack Masolino. 
[03:52:30]  Masolino will defend.  All right.  He will defend.  Okay.  I am way too fat and way too close to this crap.  When does the towel come in?  I'm going to go over here where the guy who's got his...  That's how you sop up the blood.  Here they go.  All right.  And of course we're filming this.  I'm going to you, Ope.  No problem.  All right, Anthony.  He's going to attack Masolino.  All right.  There.  All right.  He's attacking Master Poe.  Oh, my God.  That just looks so freaking horrific.  They're just kind of...  I don't know what they're doing, Anthony.  It looks like they're swatting flies.  I'm not really sure. 
[03:53:00]  It's like a...  You know, if you walked in between that, you would just be like on the floor in a second.  Yeah.  All right.  That was pretty impressive.  Hey, guys.  Break it up.  All right.  Now what are we doing?  Poe?  Oh, that's right.  He loses...  Loses all reality.  All right.  Here comes the towel.  All right.  Let's see how he uses the towel as a weapon.  Ralphie Mae, I'm not even kidding.  Master Poe is in another place now.  Yeah.  We won't even be able to talk to him after this is done.  He's in a whole other world.  Look at his eyes.  He's somewhere else now.  Why do you have this much security?  This guy's...  I don't know. 
[03:53:30]  XM isn't telling us something because they hired him to protect us full time.  That's all I know.  All right.  That's all I know.  Here we go.  Towel.  All right.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  He choked him out with the towel.  Yep.  He's down and out.  Okay.  That's good.  Tap out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't want to...  See, unless you tap out, Master Poe will continue until you are dead.  Yeah.  Just get a good choking.  Yeah.  All right.  So now he's holding the towel in front of him.  Oh, he tied his arm up and now...  Wow.  He's got his arm and his neck with the towel.  But like...  All right.  All right.  Just go... 
[03:54:00]  He's immobilized him and now he's crushing his head.  Wait.  He just picked up an improvised weapon and he's got it to his neck.  All right.  Unbelievable.  This would be great if it was TV.  Very impressive once again.  He tied up his arm and his head with the towel, immobilizing him, and then worked on  the back of his head with his elbow.  Master Poe, thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Get him out of the studio.  Get him out of the studio.  Wow.  Because he doesn't know where he is.  Thank you.  Man.  How do I follow...  The way that was going, I was thinking, rising up, back on the street.  How do I top that when I asked the chick out? 
[03:54:30]  She saw a man doing what men do.  I know.  What men do.  Did you hear my one-liner about Jaws?  Where are you going?  Bye.  God, I'm like, nothing.  All right.  Once again, losing it to the athletic guy.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  The retard of Laverne Shirley will be joining the party next.  Oh, I hope.  We're just kind of screwing it off.  We go from hot tits to...  That's the problem with this show.  Can I give out something for Ralphie, though?  The number for Caroline's?  Oh, please.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Yes, thank you.  Ralphie Mae, I saw you last time you were at Caroline's.  Maybe you've been there since.  No, I was last time.  Because I went underground for a long time. 
[03:55:00]  Absolutely hilarious.  Underground.  Absolutely hilarious.  And the shows will sell out, so call.  I'm not just being polite.  They will sell out.  Yeah, Ralphie Mae at Caroline's all weekend long, starting tomorrow?  Yeah, it's Thursday, 8 o'clock, 2 on Friday, 3 on Saturday.  There you go.  Call 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100 for your reservations.  Yes, Ben.  There's two more chicks here, too.  Oh.  Hot chicks.  Hot chicks?  Hot chicks?  Hot, and then the Greek chicks?  They're hot as well.  The Greek sisters are phenomenal.  Bring on it!  I want the Greek girl to go out with me.  I'm so depressed over whatever. 
[03:55:30]  Her chicks were absolutely fabulous.  I'll ask her for you.  Little quarters.  I can't have that.  Little quarters, perky nipples.  No, they were beautiful.  They were perfect.  They were beautiful.  I would do this with them.  You're going to ask the father to take a hand in marriage?  I don't know any girl like that.  I know.  Wrong nationality.  No.  Same machismo drivel.  No drivel, according to the guy that hates me.  Same drivel.  All right, listen.  We should take a break.  I got the Jimmy Robinson song, Anthony. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, I love the Jimmy Robinson song.  We need to set it up, though.  The problem with people joining the program every day, we've got to set these things up  a lot.  Jimmy, besides Monster Rain, which was a little game he played with little playmates, he would  yell, Monster Rain's coming.  They would run under a porch and give each other oral treats.  Perfect.  Besides that, Jimmy had a lot of imaginary play friends when he was a little pot, and  one was Jimmy Robinson, who was Jimmy with a cape.  He was like a superhero.  And Jimmy here and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Robinson and I hated Jimmy Norton. 
[03:56:30]  Don't ask.  It doesn't make any sense.  And who did Kiss hate in this scenario?  Kiss didn't hate anyone, but they would just come over, and all four of them in makeup,  but especially Gene and Paul, would beat me, and they would hurt me, and I remember kicking  me down the stairs, and then just hugging me, and loving me, and comforting me.  That was my fantasy.  All right.  Oh, fantasy.  Okay, I'm like...  They did this to you?  I love it.  Yes.  Or the other guy, or Jimmy Robinson.  And who is the other guy that's not Jimmy Norton, that is Jimmy Norton?  No, no, me.  I would almost observe Jimmy Robinson with the cape, and Jimmy Norton. 
[03:57:00]  But it was me.  I would kind of dissociate myself.  Oh, my God.  It was me and Jimmy Robinson hating Jimmy Norton, and this is very...  This is going to take another...  This is really true.  This will take another two weeks, and we'll have it all figured out.  I love it.  I love it.  And then there's Helen.  Wow.  Helen.  Holy ass.  Who are they?  Holy shit.  This show just got better.  Wow.  Now we got...  Hot Orientals?  We got sluts.  Nice.  Hero.  Oh.  They got to be pros, though.  They couldn't just be...  You think...  You think they're pros?  They don't dress like that unless they're pros. 
[03:57:30]  You know what?  I got to say it again.  I say it a lot on this show.  That DNA's a bitch, because you mix up the DNA, and you get that, and then you mix up  the DNA another way, and look over there.  It's part of Laverne and Shirley.  Proven God definitely has a sense of humor.  What's going on with these girls, Eric?  Yeah, who are they?  They'll be coming in a little bit later.  They're with this band Wolf Pack.  They're going to be doing the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Are you kidding?  Breaking in the couch, and...  Whiffle Ball.  What? 
[03:58:00]  What?  Ralphie, you got to go.  I'm sorry.  No, fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  I'm really sorry you got to go.  I can't believe you told you how to be out here by nine.  I never told you that.  This is awesome.  This show just got better and better.  And I got the mic close to the couch.  Yeah!  I think you got to go.  I'm going to smell that sweet horse.  This is not a big studio.  We need some room.  I think we have to tell you.  I think...  Eric, get him out of the studio.  Why don't all of these chicks come in here and get with a band?  I hate being a comedian.  Master Bo and his towels are going to have to come in and drag my fat ass out of here. 
[03:58:30]  I think he's got to go, Ann.  What do you think?  Choke me out.  I'm staying here.  He was.  He was pointing at his watch.  And he did side of the window.  I was like, Jesus, I'm out here with the...  By the way, I filled out way too much paperwork to do this.  I did XM.  I did like a two-hour interview with them in D.C.  They made me fill out nothing.  He won't leave.  Oh, no, no, oh, no.  No, no, no.  We're just kidding.  Look at him.  He got serious.  I know.  He's like, oh, this is going to be a challenge. 
[03:59:00]  You choke me out.  You got to carry me.  That's the rule.  You got to take my fat ass out.  Take pleasure in it.  All right.  I think that's my only weapon.  It's my fat ass.  Thank God.  Thank God.  No, no.  He's staying.  He's staying.  Because Master Po still doesn't know when we're kidding and when we're serious.  He would be really rough.  Calm down, Master Po.  It's okay.  I was kidding.  Can't you tell I'm kidding?  You got a problem with what I did?  He looks like the sensei in, just say Cobra Kai.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You can stay. 
[03:59:30]  Yes, sensei.  Didn't you get the music?  That's from Karate Kid.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, that's why his music is, because he's sensei.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead and get the joke, Ralphie.  Thanks.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I picked the music out myself.  I, man, I avoid all that.  This is the show that I avoid all that.  They smoke a lot of weed.  This is the show where guests don't want to leave.  Are you out of your mind?  You've got, okay, you just had hot Greek broads, okay?  All right.  How about this?  If you can sit through the Retard Laverne Shirley, we'll let you stay for those two hot  pieces of asses.  I can sit through.  That's a good deal.  And I think we're going to get the Greek girls involved somehow. 
[04:00:00]  Holy S.  Jesus, a red marking.  And they have fired up the Jägermeister machine.  All is good.  Oh, you can hear it humming.  With the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  So getting back to Jimmy Robinson.  Oh, yeah.  Then there's Helen.  Helen is another imaginary friend he had when he was a kid.  She was one of my imaginary friends when I was about seven or eight was a woman in  her late 30s, probably 37, with a beehive frosted hairdo named Helen.  And she was one of my playmates, my imaginary friend.  Picture any woman's picture from like 1967, 68.  Where they kind of look over the shoulder and there's like an oval light around them. 
[04:00:30]  Like that's hot.  That's hot.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Or like the baby room polyester short skirt.  Well, black and white, I'm picturing a black and white photo with a beehive frosted hairdo.  And that was Helen.  This is Ralphie May.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Rich Foss.  You're listening to the worst of Robert Kelly on the Opie and Anthony show.  Rob's a good man.  He really is.  He takes a lot of abuse.  And he's got a history, you know. 
[04:01:00]  So take a little easy on the guy, you know.  He's got bad knees.  Maybe one knee.  If I ever wonder why I can't really advance in this business, because I don't prepare.  That's my problem.  I had time.  They told me about this about four days ago.  So you would think I would come up with one funny thing.  Oh, boy.  Bob Kelly's a good friend of Jim Norton's and a good friend of ours.  Does some good radio for us.  And he was on tour with Dane Cook as part of that tourgasm.  There's going to be a DVD out eventually of the whole tour. 
[04:01:30]  And basically broke his knee playing football.  That's the whole story.  He's kind of out of shape.  Bob is a chubby fellow with a goatee.  And he jumped up to try to be an athlete and a man for once.  And he clumsily came down on his fucking, obviously easily shatterable little legs.  Supporting all that weight they haven't strengthened.  Then he hurt himself.  He broke his leg, man.  Yes.  Broke his leg, man.  Dude.  Dude, man.  I couldn't tell for the first 20 minutes of that audio what was wrong with him, though.  I could sense something was missed, though. 
[04:02:00]  I wasn't too sure what it was.  And the best part of the audio is when he asks for someone to hold his hand.  That's just disturbing.  And, well, the audio's up on opiananthony.com.  I don't think we need to play the audio at this point, right?  Mm-mm.  No?  Okay.  Sad.  Well, people have taken the audio and they have already started making remixes.  A fun little feature on the Opian Anthony show where you guys get to have fun with some  of the audio, classic audio that we have on the show, and make it into something else.  God, you're making me jealous.  I'm so hungry right now.  What do you mean, Ant?  I am done. 
[04:02:30]  Tuna.  Time.  And Dave Muir, we're going to get to you next.  We're going to get to you next.  All right?  He's falling asleep on us.  Uh-oh.  Stay happy.  Handsome.  All right.  We're going to get to him in a few seconds here.  But they're coming in.  So I haven't even heard any of these, Anthony.  None of us have, except for Steve.  Steve usually tries to give us the more interesting ones.  So we'll start with this one from Roman War Helmet from Whackbag.com.  It's Beavis and Butthead and Bob Kelly.  That was a hook. 
[04:03:00]  Jim.  He's down.  You're way down.  He's down.  He started moving before he hit the button.  I snapped my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man. 
[04:03:30]  Hey, how's it going?  I broke my knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Really?  Fuck.  I broke my knee, dude.  You dumbass.  Just leave this one flat.  Can we get him some water?  Pull my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  I got to sweep some.  Ah, don't touch me, half-wipe!  Let go, pervert! 
[04:04:00]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, fuck.  What a dork.  Fuck.  Woofie.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Oh, man.  It bent backwards.  God damn, man.  We hit somebody coming, Bob.  He said, calm.  You've got to be fucking kidding me, dude. 
[04:04:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  You can't see enough of this crap.  That was cool.  No, it wasn't.  Hey.  Uh, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's not bad.  Roman Moore helmet from whackbag.com.  Love the Beavis and Buckethead.  It was a damn funny show.  It certainly was.  Moral decay, though.  Good point, JJ.  Yeah.  All right, we'll do one more before we go to break here. 
[04:05:00]  This is from Scott from Cleveland, Anthony.  Hmm.  I haven't heard any of these.  Bill's dead.  Uh-oh.  The Bill's dead lady and Bob Kelly.  Uh-oh.  This could be good.  It has potential, right?  Well, I always like the old lady being thrown in, but it's got to work.  All right.  Well, if it sucks, just tell, you know, we'll stop it and make fun of it.  Yeah, make fun of it.  Mid play here.  Hi.  I broke my knee, dude.  It sucks.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break.  Oh, no. 
[04:05:30]  I heard my knee break, dude.  Who's this?  I'm in so much pain, man.  Who is this?  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Oh, man.  It bent backwards.  Your kid.  Oh, my God.  Oh, motherfucker.  Where did this happen?  Ah, what the fuck?  Where?  Both components are funny, but put together, it's just... 
[04:06:00]  Might as well just listen to the call.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Pull my hand, man.  Oh, no.  Pull my hand, man.  Do you want some more?  I've got to squeeze something.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Oh, yuck.  God, that fucking hurts.  Yeah.  Came down with the ball.  That's all that matters.  All right.  Well.  That stinks.  Thanks.  Dunk.  I wish I was there, so when he said, I need something to squeeze, I could have pulled 
[04:06:30]  out my mule, and he could have squeezed it with his mouth.  Hand-holding sissy.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Dude, just put away, get some lipstick on me.  I want to feel pretty in the hospital.  Ah.  Well, all right.  Damn, Bob.  We got more.  We'll play him throughout the day.  We got, like, another 10.  Mm-hmm.  That was a good try, though.  Yeah.  When you have the different audio sources like that, you got to mask it with some music  or something. 
[04:07:00]  Or just make it make sense, you know?  Well, that's the first thing.  Who is this this?  I broke my leg, man.  Oh.  Who is this this?  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, no.  Dundee.  And how are you supposed to hold someone's hand if you're on the phone with them?  Right.  Why would you call me a little dude?  Right.  Let's try this from JM.  I have no idea how good it is.  Tell me when to stop if you hate it, Ann, all right? 
[04:07:30]  Jim!  He's down.  You're way down.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  I'm gonna move if you point at the bar.  Jim.  Oh, fuck.  They took my saddle in here.  Oh, fuck.  I broke my leg in the sandbag.  Oh, fuck.  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, smile.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  This is fucking horrendous. 
[04:08:00]  On every level.  Send that shit to Bob and Tom.  On every level, that's horrible.  This is awful.  The music stinks.  You can't hear either the song or the audio that's being played with it.  And what?  Because the guy who said broken leg at the beginning of the song, that...  Guys, calm down.  Guys, banked on that.  That was fucking brutal.  Calm down.  The guy's trying.  Yeah, good for him.  Send in a camel toe song.  We'll all play that and elbow each other.  Good nature to be in Indianapolis.  That blew.  That was really bad. 
[04:08:30]  Wow.  Does it camel toe song?  Oh, it's fucking awful.  Really?  Yeah, I know.  I said it again.  Now I'm all self-conscious.  See?  Aren't we?  Douchebag listeners.  Jesus Christ.  You're burning my self-esteem there.  Now we're all just going to be quiet.  Yeah.  You know the torture I go through every day before I attempt to say the word put?  I see it.  Because of these asses.  We see it.  You'll go like, put.  Stop what you're saying and say, put.  And I was listening to some old tapes of us that have to be six, seven years ago. 
[04:09:00]  And I was saying, what, what, what, what?  And no one ever noticed.  But one asshat had it fucking pointed out to me.  Now it's a torture every day.  I have to think about it before I actually say the word.  Want to try another one here, Anthony?  Yeah, because that stunk.  That was just terrible.  Yeah, we got to leave with a good one.  Here's Dan in Pennsylvania.  I love that.  See?  Come on, see. 
[04:09:30]  Ah, fuck.  Fuck.  I broke my fucking head.  Oh, mommy.  Mommy.  It's been bad.  Mommy.  Hold my hand, man.  I got to screw something.  Baby, what the fuck?  Get ready to fuck.  You fucker, fucker.  You fucker.  You fucker.  Don't you fucking look at me. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, boy.  That was Bob Kelly meets Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.  Blue Velvet.  Mm-hmm.  That should be called That Was Awful Remix.  Horrible.  Follows Awful Remix.  That was really bad.  Come on, people.  This is a great bit.  Step it up.  All right, let's try this one.  Bob Kelly meets Keitel from Reservoir Dogs.  We got a couple of these.  This one's from Ray from Deer Park. 
[04:10:30]  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  Hold on, buddy boy.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine.  I broke my knee, man.  Uh, are you a doctor?  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Answer me, please.  Are you a doctor?  No, dude.  Okay.  So you admit you don't know what you're talking about.  So, if you're through giving me your amateur opinion.  I broke it, dude.  I felt it cracked.  And you're going to be okay.  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.

[04:12:00]  Oh, what happened?  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  I'm right here.  You want to say hi?  Yes, I do.  Say hi.  Hello.  All right.  There's one more.  That will never get old, by the way.

The kneecap is the most painful area a guy can get shot in.  Fuck you, man.  Shit.  But it takes a long time to die for me.  It bent back.  I'm talking days.  You're going to wish you were dead.  But it takes days to die for your wound.  God damn, man.  Ah. 
[04:13:30]  Ah.  What the fuck?  All right.  That was a good one.  That one was put together well.  Chemistry.  How do you get Keitel saying kneecap instead of belly?  Yeah, I started thinking about that, and I believe he said the kneecap and the belly are  the two most painful places to be shot.  I think.  Can't recall.  But that's Keitel saying kneecap.  Yeah.  What a great movie.  All right.  It's the worst.  The worst. 
[04:14:00]  Of Opie and Anthony.  This river don't go to entry.  You done taken the wrong turn.  Now let's you just drop them pants.  Drop.  Just take them right off.  Ah.  What the fuck?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Fuck.  Come on.  Squeal.  Squeal.  Eeeeee.  Ah.  Eeeeee.  Ah.  Eeeeee.

You're going to be right, dude.  I broke my leg.  You at best un-fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Ah.  Oh, no.  Ah.  Ah.  That's pretty good.  That wasn't bad, right?  That was from Rob from Columbia, South Carolina.  Hmm.  Very nice.  All right. 
[04:16:00]  A couple Bob Kelly remixes.  I heard one last night from, it was a Star Trek one that was pretty funny.  We had Spock and Kirk discussing Killing Bob.  Oh, really?  Where is that one?  Do we have it?  Is that the one?  I'm a big Star Trek fan, so I got a chuckle.  A chuckle.  A chuckle out of this one.  All right.  From the maker of the Robert Kelly Homer Simpson remix, the mix that Steve sees that was fucking  terrible, but everybody else loved, comes a new mix with high hopes of winning Steve's 
[04:16:30]  approval, and perhaps a four-star rating.  Todd from Framingham Studios presents the Robert Kelly Star Trek remix.  Captain's log, stardate 4523.3.  Deep Space Station K7 has issued a Priority One call.  We're going in armed for battle. 
[04:17:00]  It is not life as we know or understand it.  Oh, my hand, man.  Don't be afraid.  Use my hand.  There is nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal.  I'm sorry, Mr. Spock.  But I'm afraid the creature must die.  I see no alternative myself, Captain.  It very seems a pity.  Set your faces on Force 3 to kill.  What the fuck? 
[04:17:30]  Shut up, Spock!  Hey, I like that.  I kind of like that one.  The what the fuck at the end is the real payoff.  Yeah.  Force 3 to kill.  Bravo!  Oh, what the fuck?  That was Todd?  From Framingham?  Yeah.  Bravo, Todd.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, I thought that was funny.  A little Star Trek.  Yeah, sure.  Just when we thought the bit was dead.  Well.  We get that little, uh, well.  It is, but.  It never really, yeah, never really lived, but. 
[04:18:00]  No.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right, so here's the Bob Kelly Star Trek remix first.  From the maker of the Robert Kelly Homer Simpson remix, the mix that Steve C. said was  fucking terrible, but everybody else loved, comes a new mix with high hopes of winning  Steve's approval and perhaps a four-star rating.  Todd from Framingham Studios presents the Robert Kelly Star Trek remix.  Captain's log, stardate 4523.3. 
[04:18:30]  Deep Space Station K7 has issued a Priority One call.  We're going in armed for battle.  It is not life as we know or understand it.  Hold my hand there.  Don't be afraid.  Use my hand.  There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. 
[04:19:00]  I'm sorry, Mr. Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die.  I see no alternative myself, Captain.  It really seems a pity.  Set your faces on Force 3 to kill.  What the fuck?  Not bad, right?  I find it kind of funny.  This next one blows it away, though.  Yeah, well, you always play the one that's not as good first. 
[04:19:30]  You're right.  I think this one was the best one that came in, Ant.  What did you say?  From Harry T.  Which one is that, though?  I don't remember.  Henry Hill?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I think this one blew all the other ones away.  Yeah, I like it.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car. 
[04:20:00]  What do you want, fucko?  You want something?  What do you want, fucko?  What are you doing?  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.  Hold my hand, man.  I'm going to squeeze something.  Ah, fuck. 
[04:20:30]  Down.  You're way down.  He's back.  He's got to move him before he has a ball.  Stay out.  I broke my knee, dude.  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.

[04:23:00]  I got a stream suck  I broke my leg man  I got a stream suck  I'm in so much pain dude  I'm in so much pain  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Nick DiFallo, and this is the worst of Robert Kelly, 
[04:23:30]  that chubby fucking half Eskimo, half Puerto Rican jerk on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah. I was buzzing you in the nature of my face.  Oh, yeah.  Woo-hoo.  It's the Opie and Anthony program. 
[04:24:00]  We like to call it the ONA virus.  We like to call it spreading the virus across America.  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  Oh, no.  A musical.  We love being on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  What's up, Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly in studio for Jim Norton.  Yes, for Jim Norton.  Same body shape, just different face.  So I saw your knee is not quite as good as it was last time you were in. 
[04:24:30]  I was actually a month into physical therapy, walking around, perfect, almost done.  Yeah.  Stage in Vegas at the Hard Rock Saturday night.  Took my brace off because it doesn't fit with designer jeans.  You're freaking a faggot I am.  And then, is it, is it, the brace obviously has to go on the outside of the jeans, right?  No, I can wear the brace on the inside, but I have to wear baggy, I have baggy jeans that  I can wear, but these jeans are sevens. 
[04:25:00]  I don't know if you're familiar.  These freaking things are, like, tight.  Sevens?  They make me, they make me look a little thinner.  Hold on, man.  Oh, no, come on.  Yeah, seven jeans are all the rage, dude, but mostly for girls.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Guys are buying the sevens, too?  Well, guys, I actually went into Macy's.  It was actually-  Like, dude, these jeans are ridiculous.  They're, like, $200 a pair.  Yeah.  Girls are, like, doing whatever they can just to get a pair.  They'll blow you on the street just to get enough money so they can get their seven  jeans.  Yeah, that's actually true. 
[04:25:30]  It's the thing to have if you're a chick.  I didn't know there was a guy thing going on with the seven jeans.  I went to Macy's with Norton and my girl.  You know, when, you know, Norton gets on these kicks where it's like, I need jeans, I need  jeans.  And Norton, for some reason, can't go shopping for anything alone.  No, he can't.  He needs people with him to advise him.  I know, but the funny thing is, is that you'll help Norton out, you'll teach him, like, dude,  these are what you get, this is why, and blah, blah, blah.  And then two weeks later, he'll actually teach it back to you.  Like, dude, what you want to do is go, you want to get these.  And I'll be like, yeah, really, Jim? 
[04:26:00]  Why is that?  Who told you that?  I don't know, but, you know.  I dig, you freaking ape.  You know what?  Jim does that a lot.  He does.  You bring up a good point.  He is really.  He's done that to me, too.  I'm like, you don't know anything about rollerblading.  I told you that.  Well, yeah, you do.  You got to get the rollerblades with the five wheels instead of the six.  When is he going to tell me that gravity is caused by mass and not spinning a planet?  Oh, he will.  He will.  That whole discussion.  That nightmare that we had to live through.  Jesus.  I was, I was, no, whatever. 
[04:26:30]  Go ahead, Bob.  The seven jeans.  The seven gay jeans that you're wearing.  Oh, they're so gay.  I can't put-  You said they make your butt smaller or something?  No, nothing could do that.  Or makes you thinner?  They make, because you wear baggy jeans.  You're like a, you know, I'm a little chunky guy, but these jeans kind of fit, but they stretch.  Yeah.  They're like Chuck Norris jeans, you know what I mean?  Where you can, remember those jeans?  You can throw a high kick.  Right.  Still tight, but you can throw that high kick.  Sure.  But, so I put them on and I was, I wrapped my knee in an ace bandage because I was walking 
[04:27:00]  great.  And then I'm on stage, I'm doing my thing, everything.  And this, and this is, this, this gig is fucking hell.  I mean, you're really going to punch him over the face the whole time you're up here.  Hard Rock Vegas?  Dude, it's 1,500 people, but half of the people, all the people up front and back are  all, they have a stripper table from Spearmint Rhino.  These are all famous people.  Bon Jovi was there.  You know what I mean?  It's all these people that, you know, they're looking at me like, who the fuck is this guy?  VH1?  Okay, nice talking to you.  And I had, I literally had two seconds left. 
[04:27:30]  I mean, probably around five words to say in the bit.  And I came, I did this thing and I came back all my weight on this leg and it just went  snap backwards.  Backwards?  Dude, I hit the ground like a fucking, just a fat sack of potatoes.  Oh, dear Lord.  And I'm on the ground just finishing the bit.  Oh, dear Lord.  Sorry.  Should have been quick on that.  Sound like that at all?  It didn't sound like that?  Thank God I'm a...  Oh, dear Lord. 
[04:28:00]  Sack of potatoes.  What a way to end your set, though.  Jesus.  Thank God I'm like, I'm not like a joke writer.  I'm a physical comic because people didn't know.  If I was just standing there the whole time and then all of a sudden the last bit, I'm  just on the ground, just...  They got him a loud jackass anyways because they had no fucking clue.  I'm just on the ground.  Did you finish the joke?  I finished the joke.  I just go, I go, thank you.  Good night.  And then everybody comes out.  They have midgets, strippers, a seven foot gay Russian sword swallower. 
[04:28:30]  They all come out and they're grabbing me, trying to pull me back.  And I'm like, my leg, dude, my leg, my leg.  And I'm just like fighting, I'm fighting midgets and Russian sword gay swallowers.  Did you ask the midget if you could hold his little disgusting midget hand?  Hold my hand.  Five cocktail franks and a bun.  Dude, did you ever get surgery on this knee?  I was going a month of physical therapy. 
[04:29:00]  I'm fine.  It was a fucking Saturday afternoon.  This Thursday, going to the doctor, set the appointment because I had to get my knee better  to set the appointment.  Now it's all fucked.  Now it's fucked again.  I'm on Vicodin the way home.  I'm just staring at the dude's TV next to me the whole time.  He's creeped out.  I'm just...  I love the Vicodin.  Vicodin is just...  I love it.  I sometimes wish for pain so I could take it because I know if I start taking it without 
[04:29:30]  any pain, there's where the problem starts.  That is every guy, every guy that's ever had to go to rehab for Vicodin, it always starts  with an actual reason to take it, actual pain, then the pain goes away and you have some left.  That's how it works.  And then if you start taking it when you don't have any pain just because it's there, you  will then have to get more because it will be gone and there starts the big problem.  So you still have some of that Vicodin from your...  I have Vicodin.  Your dentist visit. 
[04:30:00]  It's right there at home.  I still have the Vicodin and I have the wonderful memory of what it was like to take.  It's hilarious because when I got my eyes done, I did the laser eye surgery.  They give you some Valium, you know?  Valium.  And you only need like two or three tops to get through the procedure.  It's really not that big of a deal.  They give you like 20.  They give you 20 so then I was just like you.  I'm like, wow, this Valium is pretty damn cool.  But you don't want to just take it so you kind of, hey, you know, I don't think I'm going 
[04:30:30]  to get a good night's sleep tonight.  I probably should take a Valium.  Probably take one.  Just to sleep.  Right.  And now I have a reason.  Right.  Now I have a reason.  I stubbed my toe.  But it's so funny because you have this little bottle of goodness just in the medicine  bottle.  It's legal.  You didn't have to meet some dude in an alley.  It was given to you.  You have to suck a cock.  Right.  And then you take it for the reason you initially had it.  And then you just kind of have it there just waiting for some dumb excuse why you feel 
[04:31:00]  good about yourself that you're going to be taking the Valium even though you really  officially don't need it.  Yep.  And it was definitely a sad day when I took my last one.  Oh.  Because you were taking it when you didn't need it.  Of course.  But it was over.  I probably had.  I can't remember anymore.  Maybe a dozen left.  Maybe.  And it took me probably a little over a year to get through it.  A year.  Wow.  Wow.  You know because it was like I need a good night's sleep.  But Anthony and I had this thing to do whatever the next day.  I can't be tired. 
[04:31:30]  So you know you make these dumb little excuses.  Yeah.  And you're doing the same thing with your Vicodin.  It just sits there.  It's a bottle of goodness.  A bottle of happiness.  And it's just sitting there with the big pills in it.  Those big Vicodin pills.  And I can't bring myself to take it for recreational purposes.  I love drinking.  You know I love doing drinking and catching a buzz.  I do not like hangovers.  They're terrible.  And to be able to get fucked up.  As fucked up as you would have to be drinking to get that like that that you can with the drugs. 
[04:32:00]  You would be so hungover the next day.  You would not be functioning.  You could not function.  You start.  But what happens is you take one.  I took five.  But then I needed 750.  But then one of your listeners.  I was like you know.  He was like dude take one 750.  And then take a half of a 750.  And grind it up and put it under your tongue.  Come on.  I swear to God.  So I'm in so much pain yesterday flying home. 
[04:32:30]  I didn't want to deal with it.  And it's on JetBlue.  It's not like I'm going to be in first class.  Yeah.  Like you know Jimmy Norton Entel.  But I took one.  I crumbled it up and put it under my tongue.  Why did you do that?  Did it do anything for you?  The listeners told me to do something and I did something.  Stupid listeners.  It actually.  Dude let me tell you something.  It goes right to your blood.  Dude.  Really?  Two seconds.  It's and I was just I'm just staring at the lady behind the counter like wow what a pretty  blue. 
[04:33:00]  JetBlue is such a good name.  It's like what the logo behind her and you're just staring at the color.  And on JetBlue they have these paintings.  They hired somebody to make paintings.  These really nice paintings with an airplane and like a little JetBlue thing in it.  Yeah.  So you're walking down the thing and it was almost like I was tripping because like a  little kid throwing a hat up in the air in a park with an airplane in the background.  And you're really getting into it.  I'm just like I'm just like wow man this is great art.  Great art.  Airport art. 
[04:33:30]  That's fantastic.  You know I would expect to have to be in a Holiday Inn to see Art of the Caliber.  Yeah.  But to see it here at the airport.  That's funny man.  Just talking about a little drugs.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr has entered the discussion here today.  I was taking some for a dental problem I had and I took them but I didn't take them all.  The dentist always gives you a little more than you really need.  And they sit there at home just talking to you.  The bottle.  But I don't want to be the guy that just starts taking it for no reason. 
[04:34:00]  You need a reason.  If you start taking it for no reason you're going to run out and need more for no reason.  You know.  I'm looking for anything.  Like I wake up and go I got the sniffles or something.  Is Vicodin good for a cold?  I know you're supposed to take like that and numb up my nose.  That eucalyptus stuff.  What are you supposed to take?  You go to AOL.  Echinacea.  You go to AOL and look up Vicodin and what it's good for.  It's not good for a cold.  Damn it.  All right.  I have to clip my nails and I'm very sensitive. 
[04:34:30]  It says it's good.  Anything?  It says it's good when you get poison ivy.  Really?  I got to a fight with my girlfriend.  That bitch.  I'm emotionally hurt today.  I'm hurt.  My self esteem is hurt.  He hurt me very much with his words.  We're.  So you can't be the guy that just starts popping them for pleasure because they're in your house.  You know.  Is he still talking about his knee?  Of course.  Of course.  That's becoming like a career move for him.  I know.  I'm actually going to have to bust.  I was at a funny bone and I tweaked it. 
[04:35:00]  I think I got my ankle too.  I'm going to have to.  At least I have something for my career.  Nothing.  I hung up on him last night.  He was telling me.  Oh my God.  But I was on Vicodin.  I was trying to tell him.  Yet another tourgasm story.  I can't take it.  Every time I call.  Dude.  Then the bus pulled up in Harrisburg, Virginia.  Dude.  And you wouldn't believe the wacky stuff that happened out there.  Dude.  There was a mascot and they totally set it up like punk dude.  Click.  You know you told that story for another fucking 20 minutes before you even realized it. 
[04:35:30]  But Billy sucks you in.  He sucks me in because he'll ask.  He doesn't.  He asked me a question.  So I'm like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I start answering it.  And then all of a sudden I take it upon myself to just keep talking about other things.  Like I think he's interested.  Like I think my.  I really forget that I don't have normal friends.  Because a normal friend would actually just sit there and do like his girlfriend would be there  and just like take the phone away from his ears and just, you know.  Just go.  He's talking.  He's still yapping.  Yeah.  But all my friends would go click and I'm still yapping.  So anyways, dude.  I swear to God I wanted to. 
[04:36:00]  I actually wanted to type the rest of the story out and email it to you.  I was.  I'm sitting there.  Dude.  He's told me so many of those fucking stories.  I feel like I was on the tour.  And then day three.  Yeah.  It was a big break for Bob Kelly.  It was a big break.  No pun intended.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Billy actually does the best Bob Kelly.  He used to go.  Yeah.  What was it?  Bob Kelly in a cave?  What are you setting me up to bomb for?  Inside jokes. 
[04:36:30]  Why don't you imitate me imitating you?  Dude.  Dude.  See that?  See how awful I would have said that?  Much better coming out of Bob.  It's better when Jim's on because he kind of works with you.  Billy just smashes you right in the face.  I didn't.  Why are you setting me up to bomb, dude?  I hung up on you last night.  I hung up on his face.  One of those awful stories.  Billy's the most negative fucking friend he could have.  I begin my day hearing more torgasm stories.  I'm sick of them.  The DVD's coming out.  Give us something to watch.  Television show, Billy.  Oh, really? 
[04:37:00]  Yes.  I got to tell you something, though, Bill.  Yeah.  Because of his, you know, the breaking of the knee, we have Bob Kelly remixes out the ass.  Have you heard?  I heard the Immigrant song, man.  It was hilarious.  People love making these.  Oh, you heard that one?  I got that on my iPod.  I think accidentally.  Wait, Bob, you haven't heard any of these, right?  I've heard a couple of them.  I've heard the Zeppelin one was funny.  Yeah, that's a good one.  The Goodfellas one was funny.  You know what?  I was surprised.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  Nobody did Pope of Greenwich Village, like a dueling.  Oh, that would have been good.  My thumb.  My thumb, Charlie. 
[04:37:30]  Charlie.  I broke my knee.  No, my thumb.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  I broke my knee.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand.  I just like how he says, I broke my knee, man, in the exact same way, like, 18 times in  a row to the point.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  And right when you're like, is this on a loop?  He goes, I broke my knee, dude.  What?  Did he hear the song?  He switches it up.  He switches it up a little bit.  That's one of my favorite songs.  Did he hear the song?  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude, song.  No. 
[04:38:00]  People just take your pain and your tragedy and turn it into songs.  Dude, I've got to admit, like, when I heard that play start on the audio, I was  like, fuck.  Yeah.  You sit there going, here it comes.  Yeah.  Funniest home videos, you're holding your nuts.  You're doing the same thing.  Like, uh.  Yeah.  There's the father standing in front of his son with the pitch of the baseball.  Ah!  In the background.  And the people are, like, discussing the play.  Like, dude, you should have broke right.  It's just something.  Right, right.  Fuck!  Ah!  And they're arguing.  He was down, man.  He was down.  And they have no idea that you're fucked up yet. 
[04:38:30]  I'm just off in the distance going, ah!  Right.  Ah!  But I knew they're discussing the play.  Yeah.  But that's why I started screaming, because nobody came over to me, and I was so nervous  that nobody would take me serious.  So in my brain, I just kept going, I broke my knee, dude.  And, ugh.  What about the one asshole?  God, that's the famous guy.  That's the famous sound.  I just got to feel it.  Like, oh my God, we have him in studio.  I really feel like it was just, like, abandoned.  He's been on the horizon.  He sounded so far away.  It's like a pterodactyl coming in. 
[04:39:00]  Well, here's the Bob Kelly Immigrant Song remix, because Bob hasn't heard this yet.  I like this one.  We want to play some of the better remixes for you, because you haven't heard any of  these yet.  I don't know if this one's going to be out.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I broke my knee, man!  Fuck!

That hold my hand, man, is one of the greatest lines.  You could have said that, like, even, like the manliest man could say that, and it would sound  faggy.  The way you said it, it's even worse.  Hold my, hold my hand, man.  But as soon as I said it, I knew. 
[04:40:00]  That's why.  Of course.  And then I went, I need something to squeeze.  But that was even gayer, if you think about it.  Yeah.  And then, ugh.  Oh, my hand, man.  It's getting dark.  I think this is it.  What?  There's midgets crying all over.  I don't know what to do.  Easy.  There's midgets everywhere.  What's going on?  We'll do it.  It's getting dark, man.  There's a light, and there's midgets crying.  We'll do it for Johnny, man.  Do it for Johnny.  We'll do it for Steve.  You're one of those guys on the battlefield that would just be just like the movies.  Ah!  Ah!  Hold it up. 
[04:40:30]  Suck it up, man.  Stay with us.  Stay with us.  Ah!  The blood and guts all over him.  That's what he needed.  He needed that Barnes guy.  Yeah.  Right in his face.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  I had...  You see this piece of shit?  I got a bad feeling about this one, man.  Come on.  Help me.  What do you say, Bob?  All right.
