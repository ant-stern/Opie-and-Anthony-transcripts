<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with celebratory, yet cynical, banter about the New York Giants' World Series victory, immediately shifting to complaints about the series' low ratings and the lack of congratulatory calls from Mad Dog Russo.  The hosts lamented the perceived apathy surrounding the World Series compared to the NFL's popularity, segueing into a discussion of President George W. Bush and Barack Obama's approval ratings and political strategies.  Further criticism was directed at the World Series, focusing on perceived issues like team matchups and cable television access, alongside a condemnation of Texas Rangers CEO Chuck Greenberg’s comments about Yankee fans.

The show then detailed the hosts' extravagant Halloween weekend party, filled with humorous anecdotes about their costumes and guests' antics, specifically mentioning “Uncle Paul’s” notable behavior.  This transitioned into a passionate defense of Ron Howard’s refusal to remove a “gay” joke from "The Dilemma," criticizing the perceived oversensitivity and hypocrisy of gay rights groups, Anderson Cooper, and GLAAD.  The hosts debated the state of modern comedy and whether entertainment should strive for unity.

The discussion continued with a broader examination of censorship in comedy and media, spurred by Ron Howard's comments. Opie and Anthony lamented comedians' overly apologetic responses to criticism, advocating for stronger free speech defense.  They cited examples they felt demonstrated excessive political correctness:  offensive language and perceived date rape scenes in "Back to the Future," an emasculated white man carrying a purse in a Progressive Insurance commercial, a multiracial Olive Garden commercial perceived as artificial, and an interracial couple in a DJ Hero commercial.  They expressed their aversion to forced diversity and inauthentic portrayals in advertising and film, using examples from various movies like "The Hangover," "Observe and Report," "Role Models," "Idiocracy," and "Blazing Saddles."

Ventriloquist Jeff Dunham then joined the show, discussing his new book, career, experiences with celebrities (Bill O'Reilly, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, George Burns, Mickey Rooney), and the creation of his puppets, including Ahmed. He recounted anecdotes, including near-fatal helicopter incidents and death threats related to his comedy.  Dunham elaborated on his role in "Dinner for Schmucks," the creation of his female puppet character, and the challenges of writing his autobiography.  He discussed his Comedy Central show’s cancellation due to high production costs, and his successful stand-up career and DVD sales.  He also shared awkward childhood experiences with his dummies, including bringing them to school picture day, and mentioned ongoing issues with his ex-wife, even a recent near-road-rage incident.

The conversation then shifted to Randy Quaid’s erratic behavior and "Hollywood hit squad" claims, his asylum claim in Canada, and a caller’s debate on Quaid’s sanity and acting abilities. This led into a lengthy discussion on 9/11 conspiracy theories, sparked by a caller and fueled by differing opinions on Jesse Ventura's Area 51 documentary.  The hosts and a guest (Sam) debated the plausibility of controlled demolitions regarding the World Trade Center 7 collapse, the lack of evidence supporting alternative theories, and the behavior of conspiracy theorists.

Further discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories ensued, focusing on the credibility of Ventura and Alex Jones, including Jones’ refusal to reveal who paid him to promote a 9/11 conspiracy. Area 51 was again discussed, with varying degrees of belief expressed by the hosts. The bizarre behavior of Randy and Evi Quaid, their "Hollywood hit squad" allegations, and their claims of being targeted for murder were further analyzed and contrasted with Dennis Quaid's behavior (including a mention of his poorly received Halloween costume).  The hosts criticized various reality TV shows (cake, truck, lobster, and hoarder shows), lamenting their lack of substance and forced drama.  They also mocked Regis Philbin's bank commercials, Kelly Ripa's acting, and a viral video of a woman humming during a divorce proceeding. The segment concluded with a promotion for Jim Florentine's roast, with frequent profanity and offensive language used throughout, and a caller playing Madden using the n-word.

The final segment opened with continued criticism of reality TV shows like "Full Throttle Saloon" and "Rehab," comparing them unfavorably to earlier, more authentic programming.  The hosts again mentioned having Jeff Dunham on the show. A study claiming alcohol is worse than crack or heroin was discussed, with the hosts arguing that alcohol's higher death count is due to its legality and widespread use, not inherent danger.  This led to a discussion of societal hypocrisy regarding alcohol's destructive consequences versus outrage over less harmful issues like language on television.  The legalization of marijuana and the perceived hypocrisy of outlawing it while accepting alcohol's damage were debated, with the hosts expressing their belief that marijuana is safer than alcohol. Governor Cuomo's stance against medical marijuana was criticized, and a comparison was made between the relative dangers of alcohol and marijuana use, particularly while driving.  The negative societal impacts of alcohol and cigarettes were compared to the concern over minor issues, highlighting societal hypocrisy.  The segment concluded with speculation about marijuana's eventual legalization due to economic potential and the likelihood of repeating alcohol prohibition's mistakes, and a brief discussion of Arnold Schwarzenegger's governorship and post-governorship acting career.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to Scandal  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio  Satellite Radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  It's a fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show  I'm gonna go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Is this the last straw for the rocking radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Woo!  Ah, morning  World Series over 
[00:01:00]  Congratulations to the New York Giants  Let's call them the New York Giants  Oh, back in the old days  Because they left New York, what, 1954 or something?  Yeah, something like that  So New York gets another World Series  Congratulations to New York and their Giants  Yes!  My team finally wins though  Their beloved Giants  That's right, Jimmy's team  That's right  What?  I believe Giant Orange  And they finally pulled through  I mean, all these years I've never seen a championship  It's nice to see  Mad Dog must have been very happy  Who knows?  Fuck him, fuck everybody 
[00:01:30]  Finally, a reason to have Mad Dog on our show  I'm pretty busy celebrating  I was up all night celebrating  We wanted to talk to him during the World Series  Because Mad Dog, he's got a channel, I think, on SiriusXM  I don't remember anymore  Because he didn't do the right thing  And all of a sudden he's like  Ah, it's too early to call the boys  We needed Mad Dog on our show  He's the biggest freaking San Francisco Giants fan out there  Yes, he is 
[00:02:00]  And his team finally won  And we didn't get a phone call from him  Nah  But then, you know, it'll be like the French Open or some horse shit  And he'll have no problem talking tennis until we're all asleep  Well  He gets a beating today  He gets a beating today  Not that anyone gave a flying fuck about this World Series  One of the lowest rated ever  Is it?  Yeah, the lowest  I think the second lowest rated game ever was Game 3  Maybe because they thought the Giants were up 2-0 or whatever  It was cool seeing Bush Sr. and Jr. thrown together, though 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, yeah  I know Anthony's a big Bush fan, and that's fine  No, no, no, I'm not  I'm not  You're not?  No  You sure?  Positive  Not even the pussy sense  I apologize  You don't like pussy?  No, I thought he made umpteen thousand fucking mistakes  But, Anthony, right before the show goes  Hey, you see, I don't want to put words in your mouth  You said something like, oh, wow  That guy said Bush got a hell of an ovation when he walked out  Oh, it's Texas  Yeah  All right  That's all  And then I said if he was at a Red Sox game 
[00:03:00]  That ovation would have been slightly different  So it depends on where you are  Although I don't think people hate Bush as much as they did two years ago  No, I don't think they do  I think he's smiling a little bit inside  I think he is  He's just sitting there laughing  Watch his team lose  But, I mean, he's laughing  I don't know  And then Obama's sitting there just going, uh-oh  Oh, boy  Obama's too busy doing every single TV show possible  He's trying  And then his whole hope and change thing has turned into just bashing the Republicans now 
[00:03:30]  That's all he does  Business as usual  For everybody  Politician, elitist, douchebag  What comedian had the joke?  I heard it recently  I want to credit whose it was  But he said, you know, Obama even knows he's not doing well  Because his slogan is now  Thought we could  Thought we could  I'm so mad, I can't remember who said it  Was it a comedian or a late night guy?  Somebody should  That's a funny line, though, man 
[00:04:00]  Somebody should grab that and put it on a t-shirt  That would sell very well  Thought we could  Thought we could  Ah, whatever  It's all bullshit  That is good  I just  I'll enjoy seeing the Republicans take at least the House  At least that'll break up the whole thing  Where he just doesn't have  Obama doesn't just have carte blanche to do whatever the fuck he wants  And get that Pelosi out of there  Pelosi  Wait, Pelosi could actually leave?  Well, she'll still hold her job in San Francisco  They ain't letting go of her, believe me 
[00:04:30]  Right  San Francisco, come on  But she'll be the  Speaker of the House  We could get a new Speaker of the House?  Yeah  Oh, wow, look at me keeping track  Boner  Actually, man, I should keep track of that one  We need a boner  We need a boner as Speaker of the House  Yeah  I know  I know when the Giants won in 54  They were in New York  That's why I said that  I know that the San Francisco Giants  Never won a World Series  But  Or Harry Reid  Yeah, Harry Reid's another one  Never won either  Why didn't people care about the World Series, you think?  Because you're not in San Francisco or Texas? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, I don't know  It just didn't seem like anyone gave a shit  It seems to be a big letdown after 160-some-odd games  Good pitching battle  But, I mean  Nobody would watch to root against either of those teams  Yankees, Red Sox  Enough people hate those teams  Yeah, that's true  To watch to root against  Thank you  To watch to root against  But you know how many people wanted to watch the Giants probably on Long Island  And couldn't  Because of scumbag cable vision?  Oh, yeah, I know  Well, they took care of their problems finally 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, finally  You know, whatever  Business as usual for both sides of that fucking war  And Chuck Greenberg, the CEO of the Texas Rangers  Can suck a big fat fucking cock  What did he do?  How does he get the reward?  Oh, God  Here's the Texas Rangers  Fucking Texas Rangers CEO  Here's his quote  I thought the Yankee fans  Frankly were awful  They were either violent or apathetic  Neither of which is good 
[00:06:00]  Greenberg said  So I thought Yankee fans were  By far the worst  Of any I've seen in postseason  I thought they were an embarrassment  Yeah, you know what?  How about you win a fucking game?  How about you win a fucking game?  You douchebag  You just get the gig  And he's bashing Yankee fans?  Get out of here  Shut up  Yeah, he apologized  Fuck his apology 
[00:06:30]  Not accepted  He said it  Not accepted  He spoke wrong  And he meant to say that they're passionate  What a lying sack of cunt  Major League Baseball actually called him  And made him an apology  Why didn't he apologize?  That was his opinion  The apology is stupid  That's even worse than what he said  Major League Baseball  Should shut the fuck up  And let these guys say whatever they want  What's wrong with people?  I don't care if he doesn't like Yankee fans  Fine, don't like them  An hour after it happened  They were spitting on the fucking pitcher  I don't blame him for saying that  They were spitting on a pitcher's wife 
[00:07:00]  If the whole fucking stadium was spitting on us  She'd look like a bukkake video  But you know what I'm saying  It's like who cares if he said that  Yeah, he should have every  It doesn't matter  He should be able to say that  Yes  Without Major League Baseball  Telling him to, you know, apologize  Get the fuck out of here  Don't bash the fans  Alienating those fans  Oh boy  Who cares  It makes that series  Way more interesting next year  Yeah, that way  It makes people want to come out  And see the Rangers play  Because they have a reason  To root against them  Of course  And then you want to see  Horrible behavior 
[00:07:30]  Next time the Rangers  Go up there to Yankee Stadium  Yeah, exactly  Which would be great for everybody  It would be great for the sport  How was it losing, motherfucker?  At least Yankee fans know  What it's like to sit there  And watch their team win  You dumb fuck  Not this year  Fuck him  Well, not this year  But, you know  A few times over the years  Just once in ten  Shut it  Who gets the big  Texas Rangers World Series t-shirts?  Yeah, Baltimore does so fucking well  No, they don't  Shut up  We're rebuilding  Rebuilding?  Since when? 
[00:08:00]  13 years  Jesus Christ  13 years  Exactly  Who gets the big  Texas Rangers World Series t-shirts?  I don't know  I haven't seen  What part of the world  Is hurting?  Somali pirates  Or Haiti  Well, Haiti got  Haiti got them last year  Oh, wow  Haiti's still hurting pretty bad  Haiti's the go-to place  What about them  Pakistani flood  Bud slide people?  Oh, that's true  That's pretty big  Where was the last earthquake?  The flooding  China  There was something like  Two weeks ago, right?  Yeah  China, but China's the one  That's printing them  So they could just take them  Right off the assembly line 
[00:08:30]  And then just take them  Onto the street  Yeah, yeah  No, what part of the world  Is hurting?  What part of the world  Gets the Texas Rangers  World Series t-shirts?  That'd be Africa  Africa's always a goddamn mess  Africa somewhere?  Yeah, somewhere  Maybe the world's not hurting that much  If we can't figure it out  Oh, it's hurting  It's hurting a little bit  Yeah, but like I said  Pakistan's got them floods  Haiti is still hurting  Nah, we moved on from Haiti  Nah  You know, we're on to the next big hit  That's what we do in this world  Well, anywhere 
[00:09:00]  You think Haiti's much better  Than it was when all these celebrities  Were doing their telethons  Of course not  No  I can answer my own question  But we have to move on  To other stuff  Jeff Spicoli's still down there though  I don't  He's not down there  Spicoli's always down there  He loves it  He's fake down there  Loves disaster  God, does he love a disaster  Can't get on a plane fast enough  He loves it for the first week  His dumb face down there  And then lets the real fucking professionals  Deal with the problem  Yeah, handle it  So 
[00:09:30]  Alright, World Series is over  That's the big headline today  Yeah  Fuck  Quite the pitching duel  But Lee  Losing another one  Let me say hi to Larry in Ohio  Larry  Larry  Hi guys  Or should I say  Hello  Bo-bo-bo-bo-boy  No  No, just say hi guys  You sound like an asshole  When you say the other thing  Well, sorry  One can't help what one is  I'm just as God made me, sir 
[00:10:00]  Well, it just doesn't care about baseball really  The NFL was brilliant with their marketing  When our Rooney  The original  Rooney  The old man  Said that football should be played on Sunday afternoons  Because there's nothing else for the gamblers  But there was literally nothing else in America  On Sunday afternoon  And NFL built a fan base on Sunday afternoon  That has eclipsed  Well  Just about every sport in this country now  Well, what's great about the NFL  Is they don't play a lot of games 
[00:10:30]  Yeah  162 baseball games  In the year 2010  Is just ridiculous  It really is  Don't make it sound like  Every Super Bowl  Is a wonderful fucking thing to watch  Because a lot of times  The party outweighs the game  Unless it's, again  A New York team  Fucking the Pats  You know, just some teams  That have the stars on it  But the battle getting to the Super Bowl  Is what makes football  Yeah, yeah  You're right, though  A lot of times the Super Bowl  Is a major letdown 
[00:11:00]  Because it's not about the game anymore  No  Which is the strangest thing ever  Mm-hmm  You know  Well, the Super Bowl  Growing up  He's absolutely right  Yeah, yeah  But  Everyone watched the World Series  You didn't care who was in it  But it completely depends on  Who the fuck is in it now  But it just shows how bored we were  That was before our smartphones  The Super Bowl wasn't boredom  It was all day baseball  You couldn't  You couldn't escape the World Series  No place you could go  You could escape it  But that's what I'm saying  Like  Except Cable 
[00:11:30]  If you have less entertainment choices  Of course you're going to watch the World Series  But now we have so many choices  It's kind of showing  That baseball isn't as great  As we think it is  Unless your team's in it  That's my dumb opinion  Sorry, I didn't mean to step on  You don't want Jimmy  I don't care  I don't care  Well, I mean  They didn't want to preempt  My mother the car  Or Car 54  Where are you?  We had three channels  Let's not forget  Maybe five  If you were lucky  Yeah, how old are you, bro?  Jesus Christ  Well, three plus 
[00:12:00]  Maybe an independent  If you were lucky  Are we still talking about this?  Thank you, sir  Thank you, sir  It's a good time to rally  Around the channels  Of Sirius  To see if anything  Interesting's on  Or check the traffic  If you're on your way in  During this caller  That Pearl Jam channel  Is just amazing  But you're not a big Pearl Jam fan  No  It's fucking amazing  How long do we get  The Pearl Jam channel  Of Sirius XM?  I think at least a month  That's it?  It's one of those channels?  I mean, I know that it's  At least a month  I don't know how much longer  After that  Playing a bunch of Pearl Jam  That's great  Yeah, but then they play  Some other stuff 
[00:12:30]  That I guess the Pearl Jam guys like  Which is, you know  Music that you don't really hear  On the radio  And then it's like  Two concerts a day  Two full concerts a day  And they're like  Great quality too  Yeah, it's ridiculous  It's very good  You gotta be a Pearl Jam fan  Yeah, I would say  What channel is it?  I don't care  I don't know  That's why I like  I've listened to that  I don't think I've ever  Even passed by  The Springsteen channel  Is that still here?  Oh yeah  Of course  Why wouldn't it be?  Yeah, the Springsteen channel  Bruce!  It's on in the office  All the time now  Hey-o 
[00:13:00]  You really have it?  Oh, I forgot that  Dumbbell  Bruce!

[00:32:30]  You trick or treated  When you were in high school  Maybe  I can't even remember  Maybe  My candy got stolen once  From  Big kids  They just yanked your  We were all sitting  In the field  They ran by  And just took my  Pillow case  Really  What'd you say  Hey  Yeah  Hey  Back here  Someone got it back  For me  I think  Some bigger kid  Got it back for me  Oh wow  Nice  Yeah  Like a bodyguard  Yeah  Like my bodyguard  Exactly  It was  His name is Ricky  Moody was taking my candy 
[00:33:00]  Linderman got it  And got it back for you  Yes  And Linderman got it  And then Mike beat him up  Mike beat him up  Out of shape Mike  Yeah  Is he candy  Yeah  Is he candy  You're really beginning to annoy me  Linderman  It's Moody's candy now  Moody  Hated them  Me too  I hate the little kid  Oh I know  My lunch is in the chan  He was the worst  Awful voice  Terrible movie  Christian make peace  What happened to him  I finally saw 
[00:33:30]  Human Centipede  Over the weekend  Wow  Wasn't it called Splice  Human Centipede  Human Centipede  There's a different movie  There is a movie called Splice  It's a different movie though  Which one was Human Centipede  That's where people  Get sewed together  Mouth to asshole  Yeah  Wasn't that Splice  No  What the fuck was Splice  Some different  Some genetic thing  Yeah  DNA or some shit  Literally  Just slapping people together  And sewing their  Their cut open mouth  And cheeks  To the mouth 
[00:34:00]  To the assholes  To the sphincter  And butt cheeks  Of um  Of the other person  That's in front of you  What did you think  Was it supposed to be  A legitimate horror movie  Or were they going for the goof  I  I was laughing  But I  It was horrible enough  Where it was a horror movie  Right  Who's the lucky guy  Did they have to fight it out  For who got to go first  That's the lucky guy  Uh  Well the girl  That tried to escape  Sealed her fate  As being middle girl  And  And  And then her friend  Was at the end  And  One of the funniest parts 
[00:34:30]  Is when  That  You know that  The Asian guy  That's in front  Is shitting  And  And the girl  Like  Behind him  Is like  Oh  Oh  And  And  The crazy  Creepiest  Guy  In any movie  I swear  German  Scientist  That guy  Surgeon guy  Is just going  Yes  Feed her  Feed her  Oh my god  Swallow it you bitch  I found the movie  To not be very good  But it was disturbing  On a  On a whole different level  Not because of what was going on 
[00:35:00]  In the movie  Just because  The movie really boils down  To about 90 minutes  Of muffled crying  Yes  And it never ends  They're all just  Constantly crying  And then like  When the movie's over  You go  Why do I feel like  Depressed  Like  You feel terrible  When the movie's over  Not because of the content  Just because of  All the subliminal  Crying  It's just awful  Crying  And eating shit  Except for the first guy  Who's got a massive heart on  Shitting into the girl's mouth  The first guy  Got off easy right  Did he  Oh he hasn't doing shit  That's all 
[00:35:30]  Yeah  The last girl is lucky though  At least she has  Fucking a nice girl  Shitting in her mouth  That middle girl  Really gets the fucking  Bad end of the stick  Some Asian shit in her mouth  Oh she's an Asian guy  Shitting in her mouth  A friend's head  Is up her ass  What a weird movie  How'd they breathe  Where was their nose  Yeah their nose was fine  It was just a bow  Just their mouth  They'd breathe out of their nose  Were they hoping to do good numbers  With this movie  I don't know  It's becoming a little cult hit though  I'll tell you  You liked it  Yeah I thought it was funny  It was funny as fuck  Was it supposed to be funny 
[00:36:00]  Was it supposed to be kind of campy or not  Well I don't know  I think it was a little bit  But he was so over the top creepy  That  And he was saying a few things  That were pretty  You know  Oddly funny  Right  That  And  And then of course  Walking Dead  On A&E  The new zombie show  I liked it  I give it a thumbs up  I liked it  I watched it  I liked the establishing shot  Was fantastic  When you get a guy  That just blasts a little girl  Square in the forehead 
[00:36:30]  With a fucking 38  Well  The only thing I took issue with  Was the fact that  Almost the entire show  Was like  Made up of  Homage shots  Of previous horror movies  That I've seen before  Yeah that's true  And I gave it a pass  28 days later  Yeah I gave it a pass  I was like look  They're establishing everything  You know  They just want to hook you in  So I'll give it a few more episodes  But  You know  I mean I've seen that shot before  That's what I'll do  I've seen that scene before  And like every  I felt myself picking it apart  A little bit too much  Yeah yeah  But you're a zombie aficionado  Also  Yes  And  I think they did have to do 
[00:37:00]  Some character development there  And the zombie makeup  Was great I think  Yes I thought it was fantastic  And the shooting is great  Like they don't hold back  There's heads being blown off  Which is great  I'm definitely in  I set my DVR  Which I never do for any show  Yeah I got my series manager going on  Yeah I got that one going  I'll give it a whirl  Yeah I gotta give it a chance  That was good  There was one more thing I watched 
[00:37:30]  That I thought was pretty good  But jeez I can't remember  Another Hoarders episodes  Are always on  So love those  But yeah  Just a fun filled little weekend  Of partying  And then watching a lot of television  Nice  Yeah  Alright we should take a break  Because we got a bunch of things  Before Jeff Dunham comes in here  Oh  He's bringing one of his puppets too  Book or something  Yeah he's got a book called  All by Myselves  Man he's gonna  This guy sells  A tremendous amount of tickets  Yeah  Yeah he's

[00:39:00]  But not good things  You know  Disappear  Hey what are you doing  Oh I'm scared  Well I'm scared  I'm scared of the dark too  But I go out there  Prepare  Prepare for the thrill ride  Of a lifetime  40,000 Americans a year  Die on the highways  Of America  The trucker  I'm the funniest guy  All of a sudden 
[00:39:30]  Check it out, O.P. and Anthony.  Thank you for that.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  On this November 2nd, Election Day.  Yes, get out there and vote, people.  Are you voting today?  If you're a registered Republican.  You're going to be voting?  Yes, of course I am.  I'm going out to vote.  I am voting out.  I'm in that category.  The incumbents.  I'm in that category where I don't go vote.  So I don't have a say in what happens.  That's what people tell me.  I don't have a say because I don't vote.  People can have a say, that's for sure. 
[00:40:30]  No, I'm not allowed to have a say because I don't vote.  People have been telling me that for years, so that's why I shut my mouth about politics.  No say?  No say.  I have no say.  Can't be bothered with that horse shit.  Oh yeah, it's America.  We're supposed to vote.  I just like getting out there and giving my little opinion.  Yeah, but you give your opinion every day on the radio.  That should be good enough.  You don't have to actually go out to a school and pull the levers, do you?  I want to see if we can fuck some people up, make them lose their jobs.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know if I can vote though.  I don't know if I'm, how do you know if you can?  Uh oh.  It's on your record.  You have to register.  I don't think I did.  Oh, you passed the deadline.  You didn't register.  How do you register?  It's easy.  You just fucking go online and you say, how do I register?  And then you read and you do it.  Oh, thanks.  All right.  Listen, uh, Ron Howard rules.  I didn't know he had it in him.  I really didn't know he had him, had it in him to kind of take on the establishment.  I guess we should have known.  Cause he kind of has a, kind of has a hippie thing going on with him.  If you know anything about Ron Howard with him and his wife. 
[00:41:30]  And you know, I don't, I don't know.  They either had, they either conceived their kids in cars or lived in cars for a while.  Cause they could, I don't know.  There's a story behind, uh, behind that, but he's got a new movie.  I'll call the dilemma and there's a gay joke in it.  A very, very, who gives a shit gay joke.  Uh, the gag has Vaughn's character, uh, Vince Vaughn, right?  Uh, the, the gag has Vince Vaughn's character, Ronnie Valentine calling an electric car gay. 
[00:42:00]  Uh huh.  Like, as in that's gay, which we've been saying our entire lives, not even knowing what gay  was when we started saying that.  So Ron Howard, uh, everyone wants him to take that line out of the movie.  What in the fucking, they want him to take it out of the movie.  No.  Uh, Ron Howard said he will not pull a joke from his movie, The Dilemma, a Vince Vaughn vehicle  set to be released in January, uh, that had gay rights groups up in arms when it was included  in a trailer for the motion picture.  So this, people have seen this scene already. 
[00:42:30]  I don't strip my films of everything that I might personally find inappropriate, Howard  wrote in an email to the LA Times.  It's a, it's a slight moment in The Dilemma meant to demonstrate an aspect of our lead  character's personality.  Because the character's supposed to be this type of guy that would say that.  Yeah, why can't you do that?  Uh, and we never expected it to represent our intentions or the point of view of the movie  or those of us who made it.  Okay?  Uh, Howard said he will not be scrapping the joke from the film as he does not believe 
[00:43:00]  in censorship!  Oh my god!  Guy rules.  Uh, and this is, this is one of the greatest things I've, I've read in many, many years.  If storytellers, comedians, actors, and artists are strong-armed into making creative changes,  it will endanger comedy as both entertainment and a provoker of thought, he wrote in the email.  Well, that's a beautiful statement.  He's absolutely right.  Something we've been saying for years.  Knows the deal.  You can't fuck with people trying to be creative and trying to be funny. 
[00:43:30]  That's pretty much how we've been saying it, too.  The way Ron Howard learned it was a little bit...  A little better than how we've been saying it over the years, but...  But yeah, it's good for him.  God bless this guy, because when we yell and scream about this, no one listens to us.  We're just, we're supposed to be just dopey-asshole shock jocks.  He's Hollywood royalty!  Right, but when Ron Howard comes out and says it, oh my god, this is great for the fight  that we've been fighting for years.  Eric Idle had a great quote, too, about comedians being likable and stuff.  He goes, I just want someone to be funny.  That's likable.  I don't need them to be likable. 
[00:44:00]  Just be funny.  Right.  And that, it's the same vein.  Stop trying to soften everything and make it palatable for every person.  That's not the way it should be.  I don't get so angry.  And I want to read more of this, because the Da Vinci co-director, Ron Howard, of course,  added that he had nothing against electric cars himself.  See, he even had to, like, had to, you know, go, look, relax, I don't have anything against  electric cars.  Why can't you portray a character that would be an asshole, that would say certain things 
[00:44:30]  or whatever?  Used to be able to.  It's a character.  They still have those characters, but they're not saying assholey things, which makes it  so fucking bizarre when you watch these movies.  I think he should have hit Glad harder, because they're really powerful.  I'm just glad he hit.  It's about time someone fucking hit.  I've had really enough of them, because it's like, for a group that, like, really defends  people who are treated badly, what's the point where they start to, they stop being needed  or being, like, intelligent and going, this is to defend people, like, Matthew Shepard 
[00:45:00]  who's beaten to death.  And where does it go to, hey, jokes aren't nice, jokes never lead to a guy being beaten  to death, ever.  Glad President Jared Barrio said that Howard, Ron Howard, was contributing to the problem  of gay bullying by leaving the joke in the film.  Oh, shut up, gay bullying.  Stop it.  At a time when so many in our country are speaking out against the bullying of gay youth, Universal  was right to acknowledge the offensive nature of this joke when it removed it from the 
[00:45:30]  trailers, he said in a statement.  So they had, so they removed it from the trailers, but they're not going to remove it, remove  it from the movies.  Well, Ron Howard.  Universal removed it from the trailers.  Ron Howard probably didn't have a saying.  He's probably very pissed.  Well, Ron Howard probably, I'm going to guess he's one of the guys in Hollywood that has,  very few of them have final cut of their own movies.  Right.  Kubrick had it.  Spielberg, I'm sure, has it.  I'm guessing Ron Howard has it, too.  So can he have them stop it from taking it out of the, stop them from taking it out of  the trailer?  I'm going to guess no, because how they advertise it is a studio thing. 
[00:46:00]  But it will be in the actual movie.  Yeah, I think that he probably has control.  Dude, I'm totally speculating.  We'll see.  Hopefully in the future, Universal and Ron Howard will recognize the power of their words  and use their films to bring people together rather than drive us up.  Films aren't to bring people together.  Fucking people are idiots.  And we'll never be together.  Stop it.  That's why this is all a waste of time.  As human beings, we're never all going to be together.  And films aren't made to make people come together.  Unless they're just coming together to sit in a stupid movie theater. 
[00:46:30]  That's where it ends.  They're not going to watch the movie and go, oh, you know, it's good that this brings  people together and sends a message.  Sometimes it's just for entertainment, you fucko.  That's why we have so many bad comedies out there.  So many bad comedies.  Just grab a dick and put it in someone's ass and shut up.  But I think GLAAD is full of shit when they say that.  And that's like every special interest group.  They say, well, it's supposed to bring people.  They can't be honest and go, look, it offends me.  So I don't want you to say it. 
[00:47:00]  That's all it is.  I don't like it.  You shouldn't say it.  But that's too selfish a statement.  Right.  So you have to make it look like it's for the greater good.  Well, I mean, technically it's supposed to bring us together.  But it's funny.  They don't have any problem with the GLAAD's not complaining about murders in movies.  They're not complaining about Italians being played as mobsters.  You know, shut the fuck up.  Right.  The issues around Dilemma started earlier this month when CNN's Anderson Cooper took issue  with the trailer stating it was unacceptable in the wake of gay teen suicide. 
[00:47:30]  Fuck Anderson Cooper, too.  How about the fucking shithouse news organization you work for?  They prostitute all this stuff and they make it attractive for people to do by putting it  out there in everybody's living room.  Stop it.  Why doesn't he pop out of the closet?  Thank you.  Mr. Brave Guy.  Well, we've heard.  But he's taking on this gay bullying thing.  Why doesn't he do just that if that's what he's all about?  Because that would really help the issue and push it forward.  Like, look, see? 
[00:48:00]  It's okay to be gay.  Push it forward.  He could make that message a lot stronger if he talks about what's going on in his life.  Of course.  If that's true.  But why is he sticking his fucking face in what a comedy is doing?  Oh, I thought you were going to say something else.  No, I understand why you'd stick his face there.  Who wouldn't?  But really, what do you get?  You're a news guy.  You're covering the war.  And you're worried about what they're doing.  If you really equate teen bullying to a guy saying an electric car is gay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up.  I think that's the line, pretty much. 
[00:48:30]  It's a common speak thing.  It's like, you know, one of those things in our language.  It's like saying something's a black comedy.  Oh, it was a black comedy.  We're not going to be able to say that because that's too much of a negative stereotype with black.  Stop it.  Oh, watch it.  Yeah, I mean, growing up, you would say to your friend, you know, don't be gay or stop being a fag.  But it didn't mean you were going to go out and then beat the shit out of a gay person.  No, you were just saying.  That's a big step between saying that and actually being a lunatic and a psychopath and doing just that. 
[00:49:00]  If he wouldn't go out or it wouldn't drive you to liquor stores or whatever, he was being gay.  Right.  Don't be gay.  No, that contributes to the cult.  See, it contributes to the overall cultural view of it being acceptable to be negative and to reinforce negative.  That's the garbage.  To tell you the truth, I think what they do as far as censorship and being general nudges and pain in the asses do a lot more to hurt your cause than somebody calling something gay. 
[00:49:30]  And this is why GLAAD's annoying, too, because they say that Ron Howard's thing is negative.  And yet when it comes to the Halloween parade or the gay pride parade, where it's not just people marching, but there's overtly sexual and outlandish stuff.  Sure.  They don't speak out against that.  They don't say that that's bad and hurting their cause.  Sure.  Ron Howard's gay joke.  That certainly hurts the cause way more than a dumb joke in a Ron Howard movie.  I don't know how many gay men I saw jumping around half nude with each other at my house before I watched the parade on TV. 
[00:50:00]  Exactly.  I was so embarrassed my stomach was jiggling.  Did they have the parade on TV?  Yeah, it was on TV.  Somebody had mentioned it because I guess Jill was hosting it or something.  So you checked it out?  I was like, yeah, your ex is on there.  Check it out.  I think, Jimmy, you make a great point.  Because, you know, they're looking for tolerance from, I guess, heterosexuals or whatever.  But when you see how it's represented in these parades, how are you going to get people to understand?  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it should be speaking out and go, can you please put some clothes on? 
[00:50:30]  You know, we're in the fight of our lives here.  Yeah.  Could you please not whip another guy as you're going down Broadway or wherever the hell the parade is?  And that's the stereotype that gets picked up.  Of course.  And when people go, oh, God, you want these people teaching my children?  You want them children in school?  You want them adopting children?  What are they?  And that's the stereotype that people know, especially in the Midwest, when they don't know about this city.  They look at that shit and just go like, ugh.  They got to clean up their own backyard, as they say, right? 
[00:51:00]  Well.  Or clean up their own back door.  Oh.  It's just the idea of them not, maybe they do criticize it, I haven't heard it, but if...  I don't hear it as loud as what we're hearing with this Ron Howard line.  Their whole argument of, well, we celebrate all aspects of our, whatever they call it, orientation,  or that does more, like Ant said, to reinforce a stereotype in people's mind than someone making  a gay joke.  Right.  Right.  If I'm...  Yeah.  If I'm going to be uncomfortable with the gay culture, it's going to be definitely over 
[00:51:30]  what I see in the parade over a dumb line in a movie.  To simplify it.  To simplify it.  Way more uncomfortable seeing, you know, some of the stuff that goes on at the parades.  It just, it gets people, that gets people worked up.  Yeah.  Yet they would never condemn the parade.  The GLAAD would never condemn the parade.  We're just expressing ourselves and having fun.  It's a... 
[00:52:00]  Well, people don't see it like that.  Right.  People are offended by it, I guess.  Stop trying to bring everyone together.  It's okay that we're not going to be together.  Especially in comedy.  It's just okay.  A lot of entertainment.  It's not meant for that.  Learn about other groups and all that, fine.  But to actually try to make everyone live as one happy unit, it's never going to happen.  It just isn't going to happen.  You're wasting your fucking time.  You really are.  Movies sure aren't going to do it.  Sounds intended to do.  What do you mean?  Movies are doing it.  Well, they're not bringing people together.  No, but in the movie themselves, everyone lives as one happy fucking unit. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's ridiculous.  And that's why you don't get a lot of great movies anymore.  Especially comedies.  What was the last great comedy?  Something about Mary was very funny.  I thought Observing Report was hilarious.  I thought Superbad was really funny.  Yeah, it was all right.  So, you know.  There was a few.  There was a little bit of a comeback with the Judd Apatow movies, right?  Yeah.  A little bit.  But this comedy is being released almost every week.  We're not talking about the latest comedy we saw.  We're just not talking about it anymore. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  They're awful.  What movie were we talking about the other day, and we couldn't believe the language?  We were playing a clip or something.  Back to the Future.  Oh, Back to the Future.  Sure.  Beat it, spook.  Right.  You're not going to get that nowadays.  He says shit quite a few times.  Son of a bitch.  Right.  Fucking date rape scenes.  Right.  There's a lot of shit going on.  Right.  Just to make people laugh.  That's it.  Yeah, people are laughing.  That's it.  We're not looking for dumb messages because the filmmaker had some rape stuff in a movie. 
[00:53:30]  And one of the problems is the way people have responded.  They've responded too softly.  Like, they're too apologizing.  Hey, look.  No, we don't.  No, I didn't.  Like, instead of just being.  Yeah.  If you're a comic and you know how full of shit that what they're saying is in any special interest group, you should attack it.  Say it.  Be brutal.  Don't be apologetic.  Don't sit there and try to beat around the bush.  Attack the self-righteousness of them coming after you.  Yeah.  And know what's great about this?  This story is already going away because Ron Howard said what he said. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  It's going away.  See, this is what you try to yell and scream at the corporations.  Just fucking hang in there and fight back a little bit.  And these people will go to something else.  Yeah, you don't think Glad is sitting in there reading his statement going, oh, fuck.  Well, of course they are.  Wow, he's got a great point here and we're fucked.  We're sunk.  They'll go to another cause where the people might be weaker and cave in.  That's how it works, but they don't understand it.  Once again, I've got to say it again.  Ron Howard, if storytellers, comedians, actors, and artists are strong-armed into making creative 
[00:54:30]  changes, it will endanger comedy as both entertainment and a provoker of thought.  So that's a great fucking statement.  Yeah.  Fucking great statement.  Well, no, Glad would be very comfortable censoring your speech according to what their ideology  is.  They would never want, if you said to Glad, do you want free speech to go away?  They would say, absolutely not.  Right.  But that joke should be changed.  And this should be changed.  They're all so fucking sickening.  It's bullying and hate speech.  Shut up. 
[00:55:00]  It's a lie.  It's not hate speech.  In all fairness, The Hangover was obviously a great comedy.  I didn't see it.  Did you see The Hangover?  I didn't think it was that good.  You didn't like The Hangover?  No.  What was the problem with The Hangover?  A little too over-the-top-y fucking...  Well, it's Vegas, though.  You know?  Like, yeah, it was just supposed to be outrageous.  Danny had a great take on it, too.  It was the same thing.  It was like, who cares?  It was just so crazy.  Like, you're supposed to watch it and go, oh, I can't believe that scene. 
[00:55:30]  And, oh, this scene's going to be even crazier.  Oh, there's a tiger and Mike Tyson.  It was just like...  That's crazy.  They had a wild night.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, and it was like...  I like that.  I like that.  How about you just write a good movie?  I like that.  Watch it and I'll laugh.  Observe and Rapport was a movie no one saw, which was a great comedy.  I loved it.  Jimmy loved it.  I thought that was funny as fuck, yeah.  It was the real mall cop.  How mall cops should have been made.  Didn't Ray Liotta just go, I'm like, I hate your fucking guts!  Yeah.  Didn't he scream at him?  Oh, yeah.  When he finally explodes, it was terrific. 
[00:56:00]  Highly recommend it if you haven't seen that movie.  You know, check it out.  And then call the show and, you know, if you don't agree, that's fine.  But I loved that fucking movie.  And Role Models.  Anyone see Role Models?  With Sean William Scott.  Did not see that one.  Check out Role Models and tell me what you think.  I thought that movie was hilarious.  It's one of those movies that grows on you, too.  So that's the Ron Howard thing.  Ron Howard thing.  My namesake.  Ah, yes.  Well, that's why Opie, because I looked like fucking Ron Howard when he was a little kid. 
[00:56:30]  When he was fishing.  And now he looks like my uncle or something.  It's creepy, actually.  Yeah.  He was able to work that comb over in Happy Days for quite a while.  Yeah.  He spun that around like a Carvel.  A lot of hairspray, I think.  Yeah.  And a lot of glue on the other side, I think.  Yeah.  To glue the top of his hair to the other side of his head.  Yeah.  But what the hell?  What the hell?  He's saying some good shit.  Thank God someone finally spoke out. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know if it'll make a difference, I think.  Well, he's powerful enough, too.  I'm hoping.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Ron Howard.  They can't fuck.  I bet he has final costs.  Can you imagine that we live in a world where he then has to explain that he has nothing  against electric cars because he made fun of them?  That's the world we live in.  Yeah, because the gay electric car people get mad.  Because they were mad, too.  So he had to explain, you know, I don't have anything against electric cars.  See, it's a character in a movie, not me.  Right.  See, that's how it works. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  I hope they remake Blazing Saddles to see what this fucking world has become.  A watered-down version of Blazing Saddles.  See how that works.  You think they can make that film?  Well, if they made the sheriff a white guy, then they could goof on him all they want.  Sure.  Yeah.  Speaking of...  So they'd have to do that.  You know, God bless Nick DePaul because he was the first to say it, and we certainly have  continued saying it about the white guy being just humiliated in commercial. 
[00:58:00]  Did you see the new commercial for progressive insurance with Flo?  Yeah.  Where the guy's wearing a purse?  He's now wearing a purse.  Have you seen this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you get that really fast, Danny?  I don't know if it's online.  Where, you know, they come in for insurance and the...  Emasculated white guy.  And the wife is there to take care of the car insurance.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just...  And the white dumpy guy, they got a white dumpy guy just is standing next to her.  And he's got a purse on.  Yeah.  But they call it an English, whatever the...  It's a European... 
[00:58:30]  European fucking thing.  Something.  And then he has to say, well, my wife bought this for me.  And then he looks over at her like...  It's a European carry-all.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  A European carry-all.  Well, if this doesn't push the point big time that Nick told us about first...  Emasculated white guys all over TV.  But this one, really, now we're going to just have guys wearing purses on TV?  White guys.  Is this it?  Yeah, here we go. 
[00:59:00]  May I help you?  Yes, we're looking to save on car insurance.  Even if that means we have to shop all day, right, honey?  Yep, all day.  Good thing you're starting here.  We compare your progressive direct rate to other top companies so you can save money.  Look!  He saved a lot.  And quick, too.  And no more holding her purse!  It's a European shoulder bag.  It was a gift.  Shopping less and saving more.  Yeah, his balls are in there.  See, those fucking balls are in there.  It annoys me, but part of it is... 
[00:59:30]  It's so over the top and so in that direction now.  Only the people who are doing well  would allow that beating on themselves.  Yeah.  Meaning, you could never do it to women  because they still feel like victims.  You can't do it to blacks or Mexicans or anybody  because they feel like victims.  White guys don't feel like victims.  Meaning, that's why we're like,  hey, go ahead, make fun of me.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, honestly, in the end,  I don't even really give a shit, but...  It's just another example. 
[01:00:00]  But there's so many of these commercials...  Enough already.  Like, go in another direction with the commercials.  Try to figure something new out  because we get it.  White guy sucks  and the white guy is all frumpy  and wears fucking purses.  It's all white self-flagellation.  That's all it is.  I love the fact that you cannot find  a black guy in a commercial now  that isn't wearing a suit and tie  and coming home from the office  to his wonderful family and kids  and getting into some intelligent conversation  with his wife.  Like, hey, I'm sure that exists. 
[01:00:30]  You know?  I'm sure that exists.  Hey, I'm sure it exists.  It does exist.  But, I mean, they are way over the top  with trying not to get black people upset  by the way they're portrayed on television.  It is simply...  It's almost like if you're doing a commercial  and you're desperately afraid  that the way you really feel about people  is going to come out.  So you just go the other way.  That's why they all make it all white people  because they're so afraid  that if they make a black criminal  in the burglar alarm commercial 
[01:01:00]  that the fact that they really think  that fucking blacks, they're criminals,  will become apparent.  Yeah, yeah.  If they make the black the bungling idiot,  they're afraid the fact  that they really think blacks  are bungling and competent idiots  will be apparent.  So they're like,  we can't do that.  Make him the smart guy.  That's what they like.  They like to be seen as smart.  It's nonsense.  And then, oh God,  there was an Olive Garden commercial.  I was just like...  Yay!  It was like my nightmare.  This girl is like, 
[01:01:30]  I'm finally introducing my boyfriend  to all my friends.  So we decided to go to Olive Garden.  And they're all sitting down  sharing that shit food.  And they pan around the table  and it's a fucking Benetton ad.  There's this chick  and then there's the Asian girl  and the black guy.  And it's just a smorgasbord  of culture all across.  And then she goes,  I think they liked him. 
[01:02:00]  And that would be like,  oh, you want to go to Olive Garden  with my friends?  First of all,  I'd be like,  ugh, Olive Garden.  But, you know,  if you want to get laid,  what the fuck?  Yeah, when you suck my dick in the car  after I meet your shit friends,  you whore.  And then I'd sit down  with her friends and go,  I can't say one joke.  Exactly.  I'm done.  Hey, you know,  if you and you were on a boat,  I think I'd throw her off first.  Oh, they're just idiots.  Yes.  But, you know,  in commercials and movies,  once again,  we all live in harmony, man. 
[01:02:30]  That's never going to happen  in real life.  When they show parties,  it is such a racially diverse  mix of guests at the party  that it's ridiculous.  I mean, like I said,  yes, it happens.  It's not commonplace.  Sorry.  It's just not the way it is.  You're speaking from  the white man's perspective.  Yeah, man.  But just to throw it out there,  you know,  blacks don't want to be  hanging out with,  you know,  a ton of white people.  If there's a black party,  it's going to be a lot  of black people there.  And honestly, 
[01:03:00]  if you talk to Asians openly  and if they're going to be honest,  they're like,  no, we don't want to  fucking hang out with you  and black people.  We want to hang out  with our own kind.  That's just how it is.  And then you've got  maybe a few people  that are invited to the party  and everyone gets along with fine.  But in general,  that's how it is.  In general.  There's a new commercial out  for,  I think it's like  for old people  so they don't get  their Medicaid cards stolen.  And it's a white,  old,  old,  white couple  and an old black couple 
[01:03:30]  sitting there  in a house  in some housing community  in a house  and they're playing bridge together  or rummy  or whatever the fuck  they're playing.  And they're just like  dealing the cards  and talking about  you got to watch  those insurance cards  to make sure  they don't get...  And all I'm thinking is  this guy would be  the most racist  old fuck ever.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Never have them  invite black people  over his house.  My goodness.  Of course.  Commercials, like,  look, they're whores  so I understand  why they do it  because they want to  advertise to blacks  and Chinese and whites 
[01:04:00]  and they want everybody  to buy their shit.  Movies are inexcusable though.  Yeah.  Like, movies are...  I mean, I guess  they want everybody  to like it  but it's just...  I'm not, you know,  believe me,  I'm not boycotting.  I could give a flying fuck  in reality  but the thing is  it's just so phony.  It's the phoniness  of it that gets me.  Right.  Not the fact...  And I understand  their motives  and they're so phony.  That's true.  I'm explaining that  to a smart guy.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, yee-me.  You can't force people  to get along.  It's got to just  kind of happen naturally  which will never happen. 
[01:04:30]  The masses will never  just get along  with each other.  They just won't.  Yeah, the DJ Hero  commercial people  are bringing up.  Right.  Everyone's getting along  and got the little  white girl with the braces  kissing the black guy  and the black guy  and then all of a sudden  has the braces on  because they're showing  how, you know,  you can kind of mix cultures  and everything together  and it's just...  Oh, boy.  There's a website  that does not like  this commercial.  Right.  Oh, boy.  I tell you.  A lot of comments.  Yeah.  Slides the tattoo 
[01:05:00]  onto her  and then look at this.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Where's that girl's father?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  I don't care about that.  Yeah, I do.  I'll tell you why.  Only because it really  does happen a lot.  Oh, I know.  Why does that bother you  so much, man?  If you don't even...  I just read a bunch of things.  But this will never affect you.  You don't have a daughter  that's going to come home  with a black boyfriend  or anything?  It affects me. 
[01:05:30]  It's a thug culture  being picked up  by certain impressionable  dumb white kids.  That's all.  I don't mind, you know.  Hey, I could give a shit  if a nice upstanding  young black guy  wants to fucking  hook up with some  white broad.  Whatever.  But it's that thug culture  of just getting the prize  that's like,  fuck you.  Fuck you.  Because you ain't got  no prize to give me back.  Jesus.  I just...  It's the truth.  Ain't no prize for me. 
[01:06:00]  Well, you're going to have  a good day today.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Obama's going to be  even weaker today.  That's true.  So that should make you  really happy today.  Some people had to get  my little joke last night.  What was your joke?  People are just stupid.  I tweeted something.  It was...  It was...  Like I said,  it's ironic  that with all the  foreclosures that have  happened over the past  two years  that tomorrow  Obama's going to  lose his house.  And then some guy 
[01:06:30]  was like,  it's not the presidential  election, dummy.  The White House  isn't up for grabs.  And he was serious.  It wasn't him  trying to be funny about it.  And it's like,  no, it's his house now  because he's got  the majority,  the Democrats,  so it's his house  of representatives.  You dumb fucking  shitheads.  Don't you even  understand the...  That's a good line.  It's like,  yeah,  it was just a goof  and stuff,  whatever.  Why does the one 
[01:07:00]  person bother you,  though?  I'm sure a lot of people...  There were a couple  that didn't get it.  A lot of people,  I'm sure,  got the joke  or the line.  Oh,  and then he ends it  with something like,  why aren't you on  testicular radio anymore,  meaning terrestrial?  And I said,  who wants to be?  Yeah,  when people shove  that in our faces,  I don't really get that anymore.  That too.  You have to thank them  for it.  If whatever you call it,  regular radio,  you know,  gets their shit together,  I would love to get back.  But right now, 
[01:07:30]  that really doesn't bother us.  Didn't you listen to  Jocktober,  What You Can Get Away With?  Nothing.  I clicked my heels  when we finally went off radio.  I know.  I missed it.  There's a lot of people  to talk to.  I couldn't be fucking happier  that we are off  that shit medium.  I listened to some of the  best-ups from CBS.  Now,  NEW is another story.  We were under the radar.  It was a whole different time.  We got away with murder on there.  We sure did.  The CBS side,  right before,  you know,  we came here permanently,  just exclusively. 
[01:08:00]  I listened to some of it  and I'm like,  it's frustrating.  I go,  I just want to,  I'm listening,  going,  why can't I just say dick?  Or fucking,  you know,  something.  That was awful.  Twat.  Not even that.  There was other stuff  that we should have been able to say  we weren't allowed to say.  Whatever.  That guy hung up.  Fuck.  Oops.  I like talking about comedies.  He said something like,  every time you guys talk about  good comedies,  why don't you bring up  idiocracy or whatever that was? 
[01:08:30]  Idiocracy.  A lot of people talk about that movie.  I've never fucking seen it.  I've seen it.  It's,  you know.  Is it good?  What is it about?  Yeah,  the idea is good.  The guys that go way,  way in the future  and realize that  people have just gotten  dumber and dumber and dumber  to the point where they're  just profoundly stupid  and they're not.  No.  Yeah.  That was it, huh?  That's pretty much it.  What am I going to do?  This guy has a theory about how.  Synopsis on it  like it's Cuckoo's Nest. 
[01:09:00]  Shiz in Jersey.  What's up, Shiz?  Hey, Jiz.  Hey, man.  Get it?  I was wondering if you guys  thought my same theory  applied to Home Depot.  They're always catering to,  like,  black people.  It's like,  if something breaks,  all you hear is two black women  talking about,  I can't afford this or that.  They're like,  the Home Depot.  What hour?  I just kind of thought,  you know,  the only people you hear  are black people.  And it's like,  what do they just think?  They're the only poor people  around here?  Yeah,  there's a lot of poor white people. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Going to the Adirondacks.  The Home Depot  is just about black people now.  Well,  McDonald's has given up  and just caters  to black people now.  Which is amazing.  I remember as a kid,  it was,  you know,  you take your family  to McDonald's.  Now it's just...  You would never go  to McDonald's now?  I would never go  just because I'm not  going to eat that shit.  It's terrible.  I'm not eating food  that's just going to  fucking clog up  every fucking little tube  in your body.  Well,  don't forget about it.  The McRib is back  for a limited time only. 
[01:10:00]  And believe me,  those commercials  are a joy.  Why limited time only?  If it's that good,  why don't they just  bring it back?  I don't know.  I think they put it out  there just long enough  so people aren't actually  falling down dead  as they walk out  of McDonald's doors  and then they take it away.  The second people's  cholesterol reaches  600.  They pull it.  Salt is evil, huh?  Wow.  It's the only thing  that makes any of that  shit taste good.  Fuck what it does  to you, though.  It makes me clench 
[01:10:30]  my fist so tight  that it hurts.  That's what salt  does to me.  And all that food  just has a shitload  of fucking salt.  And they've got to have  the soul jazzy music  behind it with...  Oh, that's an old school  McDonald's commercial?  Yeah, look at that.  It's about chasing  the Hamburglar around.  Yeah, it was nice.  There it is.  Happier times, right?  Yeah, happier times.  No, no...  There's nothing about  ethnicity in this.  It's not like...  Now it's just,  come on down to 
[01:11:00]  McDonald's  for McRib sandwich.  Come on down.  McDonald's.  You live in a compound.  Why does this bother you?  Because it's the world  outside and it's so fake.  But you already decide  not to live in that world.  Phony.  You've got everything  you need in your compound.  You maybe venture out  every once in a while  to a casino or a cruise ship.  That's it.  You don't have to worry about it.  More than... 
[01:11:30]  I present myself  as someone that doesn't  leave the house.  I go out a lot.  Believe me.  And you see some stuff.  I'm out a lot.  I drive every day,  which is a pain in the ass,  which you just look at people  and I could fucking call.  I could call it  a mile away  when I see a car.  I go,  I know who's driving that car.  And I look in and go,  yep,  I was right.  Rarely wrong.  Sometimes I am  and it's a surprise.  All right.  Is he here?  Yeah.  Want to bring him in? 
[01:12:00]  Where is he?  Yeah, let's bring him in.  Or you want to do a quick break?  How do you want to do this?  How much time does he have?  A half hour a day.  Oh, all right.  Bring him in then.  Yeah, get him.  Yeah, he's got to get it.  Yeah, yeah, bring him.  Some puppets got to be somewhere.  Hey, it's George.  George have the mirror.  George have the mirror.  I don't hate that.  I wonder if he does.  What?  Yeah.  I don't hate when people  talk about George  as a separate entity.  Reference. 
[01:12:30]  Drives him nuts.  But he talks about it  as a separate entity.  No, but I mean like  when they joke about it,  like, let George drive.  Oh, George drive.  He hates that.  I've been torturing him  with that for years.  Oh, I know.  I love doing it to him.  I used to bring him on.  I'd be like Otto  and his wooden buddy George.  It was like a knife in his chest.  His wooden buddy.  Oh, he made him sick  to his stomach.  Walking down the hall,  there he is.  Yes, that's Jeff Dunham,  all right.  Oh, with a big suitcase.  Hey, guys.  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, sir.  Thanks very much. 
[01:13:00]  I hope you weren't listening  to the show.  We were a little bitter there.  No, I was trying to figure out  what the McDonald's thing was.  Everybody was talking  and I was listening.  Yeah, you were listening  to the whole thing?  Nah.  I don't need it.  Hey, Jesse.  Oh, you're right?  Yeah.  It's probably a sponsor of yours  in some way, shape, or form.  Jeff Dunham's got a book out  all by my selves.  Thanks very much.  Yes, and it's a thick book.  It is a thick book.  How long did it take you  to write that one?  About 14 months.  It was a pain in the ass.  It really was.  It was like I woke up.  And you know,  most autobiographies  have ghostwriters 
[01:13:30]  and we started with one  and the guy was very nice  and did a good job  but after a couple chapters  I looked at, you know,  as a stand-up,  your words are everything  and I went,  this is not me.  I don't sound like this.  Sorry.  So we threw it all away.  14 months later,  it was every morning  I'd wake up  or every time  I'd walk off stage  he's like,  ah, crap,  I gotta go write the book.  Oh, yeah,  that's like work.  Oh, it is.  It's like a never-ending  English assignment  but, you know,  there's all kinds of stories  and it's 40 years  of performing  and lots of ups  and lots of downs  and it's all right there.  Wait, when did you 
[01:14:00]  start performing?  When I was eight.  Yeah, okay.  Because when you said  40 years,  I'm like,  we're not looking  at a 60-year-old man here.  There's pictures in here  that are cool, though, man.  It's like from  the late 70s interviews  from like 1976, 1975.  Can you see who that is?  Yeah, but wait, wait,  don't say anything yet.  Don't hit the punchline.  It shows me  sit on the couch  with me.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  Don't say the punchline yet.  It shows me on the couch.  I'm 14 years old,  sit on the couch  at my parents' house,  dummy on my knee.  It's a 1976. 
[01:14:30]  It's a film camera.  That's how old it was  because videotape  was only being used  in sports and news  at that time  and the reporter  is a long-haired  Bill O'Reilly.  Wow.  He looks nothing  like Bill O'Reilly.  He looks like  Michael Nesmith  from the movies.  Yes, he does.  I can't believe  that's Bill O'Reilly.  Right.  It's a side shot  so you don't really  get a good look  at his face.  That picture  and the accompanying film  that took me 14 years  to finally get.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, it took me  14 years to get it. 
[01:15:00]  Why was it so hard  to get?  It was just...  Because it was  the ABC affiliate  in Dallas.  They had hippie.  Right, exactly.  See, that's the joke.  I was 14 living  with my parents.  They made me  get that haircut.  Yeah.  Bill had the choice.  Bill chose that hair.  He looks like  Herb Tarlick.  But it took me  14 years to get it  because they'd archived...  It was the ABC affiliate  and they'd archived  all the films.  Nobody had organized it.  But you're Jeff Donum.  Huh?  But you're Jeff Donum.  That was how we got it.  Finally, somebody went,  okay, okay.  And we literally  had to pay a guy 
[01:15:30]  to sit there  and go through  hours and hours of film.  And the way I...  He said,  can you narrow it down  to when it was?  My parents couldn't remember.  And I'm looking  at the picture  and I went,  wait a minute.  There's azaleas  in the flower pot  on the table.  And I said,  mom, did you ever  have fake flowers?  And she goes, no.  And I knew it  because azaleas  only grow for like  a month in Dallas.  So I narrowed it down  to a month.  You CSI?  Columbo saw some murders.  Columbo.  Is Peter Fox still alive?  I don't think so.  If he is, 
[01:16:00]  he shouldn't be.  I got to rub it  into Jimmy a little bit.  So you've got  a lot of great pictures.  He has good photos, man.  I'm sure the book  is good too.  But I mean,  we all go to the pictures  first, right?  Jimmy, how jealous  are you of some  of these pictures he's got?  He's got George Burns.  Yeah, he's got some great...  My favorite,  the one I would want  the most if I had  any of them...  Johnny Carson?  That would be Carson,  yeah.  Because I never met Carson.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a cool night.  That was the first time  I was on.  I was on with him  four times.  They repeated one of them,  so I usually say five,  but it was four.  Yeah.  So, yeah, 
[01:16:30]  that was a Friday...  You know,  Friday night was the time  with Carson.  Now it's Thursday night  is the best night.  But Friday night,  that was his night.  It was the best audience.  And that night,  it was Bob Hope,  B.B. King,  and me.  Jesus.  And it was like,  that was awesome.  And I look back  at the tape now  and I just kind of cringe  because, you know,  that was a long time ago.  But then it was,  that was an awesome night.  And I did my little bit  with Peanut and Jalapeno  on a stick on stand-up.  And, you know,  you never go to the couch  on your first time.  And Friday de Cordova,  the producer,  had said,  just put Walter behind the couch  just in case.  And he goes,  there's no way  you'll get over here 
[01:17:00]  on the first time,  but just in case.  And I finished my stand-up,  got ready to walk backstage,  and the guy waves me  over to the couch.  And if I watch the tape,  I can see this instant  of horror in my eyes  of like,  what the hell?  I remember I heard  Letterman saying,  talking to Carson  your first time on  is like talking to the guy  on the $5 bill.  You've seen him  your whole life,  but what the hell  are you going to ask  or say to him?  How much time did you have  on panel the first time?  Well, I don't remember.  I just kind of fumbled  around a little bit,  but then I pulled Walter out  and then I had all these lines  in my head.  It was like, 
[01:17:30]  do you know who this is?  Yeah, it's my wife's  first husband.  And, you know,  and he starts looking at Ed,  stop sending me  all your damn mail.  Don't you have some  envelopes to lick?  Those kind of things.  Right on, bro.  But at the end, though,  Carson goes,  you know,  he thanked everybody.  Jeff, thanks for coming.  Hope you can come back soon.  And Walter goes,  yeah, it'll be a cold day  in hell before you  get me back here.  And luckily,  Carson laughed.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, that would have sucked  if it ended on a  complete zilch.  Yeah, and there are  a couple of comics  you hear about  that just completely died  and Carson would be angry  and you never came back.  On the couch died? 
[01:18:00]  Both.  Oh, yeah, both.  And you never got back.  Can you name one of those guys?  No, I don't want to.  All right, that's fine.  Hey, did Bob Hope talk to you  or did you just get the picture?  Oh, yeah, there's a couple  stories in there.  I actually,  I won a collegiate talent show  and that's how I really started  in big show business.  And the woman that set all this up  kept pairing me with Bob Hope  around the country  because he would always do  these parents' weekends  at universities.  And so I was the opening act  in a bunch of different...  For Bob Hope.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  But here's a couple of the stories.  And so my favorite one  was before a show one night  he goes,  he came up to me,  he goes,  so what are you doing  after the show?  And I said,  well, I'm going back  to the hotel.  And he goes,  well, and this was when  I lived in California.  He goes,  why don't you get on the plane  with me and Dolores  and fly back to Burbank?  And I'm like,  uh, Bob Hope's private plane.  Okay, I'm there.  And so I literally  in the middle of the night  I'm sitting there going,  how the hell did this happen?  And if I said it once,  I said it 10 times,  no, Mrs. Hope,  I don't know how 
[01:19:00]  to play Canasta.  Oh, she couldn't  go up and play cards?  Yeah, she wanted to play cards.  I was like,  I have no idea how to play that.  What do you say to Bob Hope  for all that time?  I mean, he's a legend,  but I would have nothing  to say to him.  Well, the sad part was  he couldn't hear  and he couldn't see.  And he refused to ever wear  glasses or hearing aids.  So, you know,  you had to yell at him  just in simple sentences.  And the funniest part was  I did a Young Comedians  NBC special with him  and literally the cue cards were,  I mean, the camera  was a foot from his face 
[01:19:30]  and the cue cards  were right there  and the lettering  was as big as Montana.  Right in front of his face.  Yeah, right in front of his face.  We got to back up.  You were warming up  for Bob Hope  when he was in that condition.  Was he still killing on stage?  It was the same thing  with George Burns.  There's a story in there  about George Burns  when I was working with him  and it was like  same kind of deal.  George was worse though.  You see this tottering  little old man  come out of this limo  and I'm like,  what debt does he have to pay?  How much money  does he owe  that he has to do this?  And he shuffles,  he can barely walk  and there's thousands of people 
[01:20:00]  waiting to see him  and I'm like,  I don't even want to see this.  This is going to be horrible.  Then the light goes on,  the microphone turns on,  he grabs his cigar,  he goes in the middle of the stage  and it was like  somebody hit him  with defibrillators.  The guy was just like  walking around  on the stage  telling jokes  and the timing was there  and then he'd walk off stage,  spotlight go off  and there's this little old man.  Old fashioned show business.  That's exactly right.  The show must go on, right?  Bob Hope was different  because he had his conductor 
[01:20:30]  or his piano player  and when he'd forget  what the next joke was  he'd walk over  to the piano player  and the piano player  would whisper it to him  and then he'd walk back  to the mic and tell the joke.  Wow.  The Rickles are still sharp  at his age,  it was mid-80s.  A lot of those guys,  comedians have a long  fucking life.  But it looks like  George Burns  just waited all day  to have that one hour  of energy.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  Just got it together  for the hour on stage.  And you can see  in this picture,  that's what the caption was,  you can see how excited  it was like 1984.  Yeah, he's like,  good God,  this guy's like,  one more photo. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, you can't tell  what Burns is thinking.  You can tell  he's not thrilled.  Exactly.  It's a very mediocre look  on George Burns' face.  Many of the pictures  you have, Jim.  I've never had  a happy celebrity  in a photo.  Mickey Rooney, though.  Mickey Rooney,  I was on the road  with him.  Do you remember  a musical called  Sugar Babies?  Yeah.  Was it good?  Yeah, what they did was...  I remember that one.  It was a woman  that was in it.  Ann Miller.  Ann Miller, right.  Sugar Baby's a term,  by the way,  that a girl refers to herself  when she has a sugar daddy. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  That's what a prostitute  would put out on Craigslist.  I'm a sugar baby.  Yeah.  Oh, you know that?  Is that right?  Yeah.  I didn't know it was a musical.  I didn't know that.  All right.  But yeah,  but on the road  with him for a year  and it was...  The guy's nuts.  Frickin' nuts.  And he's four feet tall.  Oh, he's tiny.  And after I was in the show  for about a week,  he called me  into his dressing room  and he goes,  and I was doing pretty well,  you know,  even with these old audiences  and he says,  remember,  just stuck his finger  in my face  and he goes, 
[01:22:00]  remember,  the only reason you're here,  the only reason you're here  is so I can change clothes.  Wow.  What a dick.  He put me in my place  and I just went,  yes, sir.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  What do you say to that,  right?  You need the gig  or want the gig.  And he was kind of right.  I mean,  you know what I mean?  So there was a variety  act there just so he could  change clothes for the next sketch.  So you were a time buffer.  Exactly.  You don't have to say that,  though.  Yeah, exactly.  He was a dick.  I met him here.  But he's known to be  like really abrasive.  He found out I was 
[01:22:30]  a dirty comic  and he gave me...  He wasn't mean to me.  We took a photo together  and then someone's like,  Mickey goes,  give me a joke.  This is recently,  before his 90th birthday.  I'm like,  look,  you would not enjoy  what I have to give you,  Mickey.  Trust me.  I'm dirty.  And he goes,  oh,  and instead of laughing it off,  he's like,  you shouldn't curse,  you'll lose the audience.  Shut up.  Shut your face.  But he was nuts.  I mean,  the guy,  you wish,  even when you're 50,  you have the energy  this guy had at 65.  I mean,  oh,  good God.  Yeah,  but to carry on 
[01:23:00]  a conversation with him  was just to listen.  You never got a word in.  Yeah.  Yeah,  he holds court,  right?  One of those guys.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And it's amazing.  I'm very tough here  with what I should have said  to Mickey Roney,  but I actually listened  to his lecture.  I was like,  no,  you're right,  I shouldn't curse.  Fucking a worm that I was,  then he walked away.  Thank you.  I just took my lesson.  Something advice.  Good point,  good point.  I'm looking at another picture here  that is just frightening.  Uh-oh.  You build your own choppers?  Oh,  yeah.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  When did you start that hobby?  Go look at rotorway.com. 
[01:23:30]  Uh-oh.  It's like,  oh,  boy.  Now this company's been  in business for decades.  They build kid helicopters.  It seats two people,  goes 100 miles an hour,  I've built,  I'm working on the fourth one  right now.  I'll build them,  fly them for a few hundred hours  and sell them  and go do another one.  They are pretty cool.  You build them from scratch?  From the kit,  yeah.  That's good.  I worked that well  for John Denver.  What's the matter what you love?  Well,  John Denver didn't build it.  You know how much money you got?  What are you,  nuts?  No,  it's fun.  I don't have much time anymore.  We know how much he has.  He builds his own helicopters.  Oh,  I get it.  It's a hobby.  He builds four helicopters. 
[01:24:00]  I know when we were,  like,  fired for two years,  I built radio control helicopters.  He's building the real thing.  I could not imagine  building the real thing.  Did you get good at flying them?  Not too bad.  By the end of our time off,  it got pretty good.  But the question I have is,  okay,  now you've been doing it  since,  what,  1985?  We're doing what?  Building helicopters,  choppers,  so 25 years,  right?  86,  right.  Wow,  damn.  The first one you built,  you were brave enough  to try it out?  Well,  what you do is,  you go to the factory  and they give you, 
[01:24:30]  you know,  you earn your,  you get your license  and they teach,  first they teach you to hover.  Then you go home  and you master the hovering  on your new helicopter.  How high did you?  How high?  18 inches to 3 feet.  Anything above 3 feet,  the engine goes out  and you're going to bend something.  But,  yeah,  the first time,  there's an air scoop  underneath the belly  of the helicopter  and I built the whole thing  and so the first time  I'm out there  and I get to hovering  and I'm hovering around  and I'd forgotten  that I'd left a couple of bolts  in that air scoop.  So here I am hovering,  I lift off,  I move over  and there's a pile of bolts 
[01:25:00]  on the ground.  It's like,  what the,  man,  so,  yeah.  Oh,  damn,  not good.  I did crash it once.  Really?  That story's in there.  I almost killed myself once.  You don't have to give away  all the stories  because you want people  to buy the book.  Yeah,  I did roll it up  in a little ball  and got a concussion  and was out in the middle  of nowhere.  But now you're really good  at flying these things,  obviously.  I guess.  You never know what.  Ah,  here's a helicopter.  What are you going to do?  It's not much.  Once that engine goes out,  there's nothing you can really do.  Yeah,  you got one shot.  Right.  Well,  same with an airplane.  You got one shot. 
[01:25:30]  A little collective,  right at the right time.  Right.  One shot.  And these go how high?  Oh,  you know,  the ceiling on them  is 10,000 feet.  Oh,  Jesus.  But anything above that  and you start,  you can't think straight  because there's no more oxygen.  How high have you taken yours?  I actually took it up  to about 8,000 feet once  and I called my instructor back  and I told him  and he goes,  why did you,  why?  Why?  And this was at sea level.  I went from sea level  to 8,000 feet.  He goes,  why did you do that?  And I went,  just because I wanted  to see if it could.  And I, 
[01:26:00]  you know,  what if it couldn't?  Yeah.  By that time though,  literally in the middle  of the summer,  I don't know what  the temperature was,  but the gauges started  freezing up and yeah.  At that height?  Oh yeah,  at that altitude  in the middle of the summer  in Texas.  It was like,  so anyway,  who knew about that?  Damn.  Building his own choppers.  That's pretty cool.  That is,  it is cool.  I don't have the balls  to do that.  No fucking way,  man.  Is this your first book?  By the way,  before I ask,  you also,  I saw a photo  in the tour bus  which has like the, 
[01:26:30]  a little work area.  Do you build your own?  Yeah,  build the dummies.  Yeah,  and Ahmed,  Ahmed is the one  that obviously  has gotten me  kind of where I am now,  but I just finished  painting him yesterday,  but Ahmed now has a son  and it's wrong,  wrong,  wrong.  He's the half dead terrorist.  He's like half skeleton,  half real face.  I like the fact  you named him Ahmed too.  That's great.  Instead of some  politically correct name  like Steve.  Yeah.  Steve the terrorist.  Yeah,  it wouldn't work.  Have you gotten any,  I don't know, 
[01:27:00]  I'll just say death threats  or anything.  Oh sure.  Yeah,  the worst was after  we had a song called  Jingle Bombs  came out  and obviously  to the tune  of Jingle Bells.  But that was,  has it been two years now?  I guess it's been  two or three years  that it came out  and yeah,  we got a couple of,  yeah,  we actually got  a handful of them  and a few of them  were of note.  And yeah,  but since then  it's like freaking Ahmed,  you know,  we don't say  he's any type of religion. 
[01:27:30]  We're not making fun  of anybody.  Sure,  he's got the thing  on his head  and he's from  somewhere east of here.  But you know,  we never,  we all know.  We all know.  Yeah.  But he says  he's not Muslim.  We're not making fun  of anybody  except,  you know,  he has a weird accent  and you know,  he's a failed terror.  Does he say  he's not Muslim?  Yeah.  That's probably  a smart move.  Yeah,  he says he's  I'll cut my head off.  Yeah,  exactly.  He says he's Scientologist.  And then later  he says he's Catholic  because he's,  you know,  so you never know  he's Catholic.  Well,  that brings us  to the next, 
[01:28:00]  I don't know  if it's a question,  but your YouTube videos,  Jimmy was,  how many views,  Jimmy?  I guess the total  is over 400 million  on,  I guess,  a few of them.  Yeah,  oh,  they've gone over.  You got one of the,  when you look at  the biggest YouTube,  the top viewed videos  of all time,  you're right there.  Yeah,  it was,  sometimes it's up  in the top five,  sometimes in the top 12.  Do you still check it?  You do.  Not as much  as I used to.  But you do.  No,  because it started  going down a little bit  because Justin Bieber  came along  and zooms to the top  and then, 
[01:28:30]  what's the other one?  The baby,  the laughing baby  and Lady Gaga.  Oh yeah,  Charlie Bit My Finger.  Charlie Bit My Finger.  Charlie knows.  Charlie Bit My Finger  deserves to be up there.  He knows all the top videos.  Of course.  Your top video,  how many views?  I don't know,  it's like a,  I don't know.  But what happens is  people upload these things  and what we were doing  is the same thing  that networks do.  We were policing it  and there was  all the DVD stuff  so we would pull them down.  We'd get them pulled down  but then when one of them  reached 11 or 12 million 
[01:29:00]  I was like,  wait a minute,  maybe we should be  approaching this  like the Grateful Dead  and embrace it.  So we left a few of them  up there  and this one,  we don't even know  who this guy is,  posted this thing  and it's gone up  to 120 million  something or other views.  Oh my God.  I don't know,  whatever.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah,  it's nuts.  And what's cool  is it's a 10 minute video.  It's not like 30 seconds  or two minutes.  It's people I used to sit there  and watch.  Yeah,  that's the one we've all seen.  What did that take,  did that take you  like from this size theater  to that size theater  or from clubs into theaters?  No,  that was the,  when the Comedy Central thing  came along,  we had the first DVD 
[01:29:30]  in 06  and that was arguing  with myself  and that did not have Ahmed  but then we did  Spark of Insanity  which had Ahmed  and that came out  in the fall of 07  and by the spring of 08  it had just gone  freaking bananas  and we started  tracking these things  and it was the  Ahmed YouTube video  that was going everywhere  and I never thought,  you know,  there have been a few surprises  along the way  the last few years  but I never thought  beyond the borders  of our own country  but we started tracking  these things  to see where the hits  were coming from 
[01:30:00]  and it was mainly  our U.S. military  all over the world  and then it would spill out  into the other countries  and then it was like,  and then we started  tracking the Google hits  and the Google hits,  it was not only,  I was being Googled,  the number one country  was not the United States,  it was South Africa.  Wow.  Yeah,  so,  and then we realized,  oh man,  we could start touring  these places  so that's why we started,  we've done a couple  of European tours,  we've gone to South Africa,  we've gone to Australia,  China's on the books,  China,  how the hell 
[01:30:30]  am I going to do my act  in China?  But,  you know,  we do these Scandinavian countries  where English is  the second language,  it shows how much,  you know,  they emphasize a foreign language  and we don't  because they got it,  they got the sense of humor,  they knew all the characters  you know,  they get all our TV.  But it's English,  that's not a foreign language.  Exactly.  That's how we feel here,  by the way.  Right.  So yeah,  I know that was.  In South Africa,  that was the one that was,  I was like,  man,  I'm a little bit worried  of this,  I'm carrying around  a dead terrorist  in my suitcase  in South Africa,  is this a good idea? 
[01:31:00]  But we had security  and everybody was really nice  and it was unbelievable.  Crowds,  and you know,  not to toot the horn  a little bit,  but these were big audiences,  these weren't like  400 seaters,  these were 5,000,  6,000 seat venues  and we did nine of them.  Wow.  Yeah.  In South Africa?  Yeah,  it was crazy.  And it confused,  it confused.  That's every white person  in South Africa.  That's exactly right.  I was like,  what is up with this?  I thought we're going to have  at least 50-50.  No,  it was all white people.  Wow.  But only 3% of the population  is white there.  Yeah, 
[01:31:30]  yeah.  And I guess you're right.  Willie Tyler  would make a killing over there.  Do you get along  with other ventriloquists  or is there no  competitiveness for you?  We have a ventriloquist  convention every year,  which is kind of frightening.  And I've been going  every year since 1975.  You get the biggest one  there,  obviously.  Who's number two  at those things?  I couldn't even give you  a number two.  There's a handful of guys  that have been doing it.  All right,  name number two right now.  Who's number two?  That comes to the convention?  Senior Wentz's. 
[01:32:00]  Who's another big  ventriloquist?  Well,  he's only come once,  but there's Terry Fader,  the guy that won  America's...  Oh, sure.  Yeah,  I got talent.  He's only come once,  though.  What ever happened  to Taylor Mason?  Yeah,  he didn't come  to the conventions,  but yeah,  he's out there.  You bring up Terry Fader,  that guy is a rock star,  too.  He's right there.  Yeah,  he's got his show  in Vegas.  When America's got talent  and now he's just,  I don't know,  probably pushing a billionaire  at this point.  Yeah,  I mean,  our acts are polar. 
[01:32:30]  They're opposites.  Yeah,  if you like his show,  you'll hate mine,  vice versa.  Right.  So,  yeah.  I mean,  he does a great job.  He sings and everybody  loves him,  but it's a whole different ball.  Do you like Otto?  I don't know.  It's different.  Do you like Otto?  Oh,  yeah,  Otto and George,  they're awesome,  man.  I used to carry a couple  of Otto's audio clips  on my laptop.  Just ones you don't want  to repeat in mixed company.  It's awesome.  I haven't seen him  in a while.  He's doing a while.  He was in the other day.  We should see him  all the time today  just to say hi.  Yeah,  he's hysterical. 
[01:33:00]  He's bitter.  He's bitter.  Didn't he sell  the original George  to like David Copperfield  or something?  Or a copy.  Copperfield loved him  and was kind of  obsessed with him.  I don't know.  And then he bought  a new George,  yeah.  Yeah,  he had a new George  made by the same guy.  He's got the head moving.  He's got a whole bunch  of stuff going on.  Otto should just be  bigger than he is.  We've been saying  it for years.  We did,  you know.  But he's,  you know,  filthy.  He's a stick man.  Yeah,  in a good way.  Hilarious.  But everybody,  everybody,  he's a guy that 
[01:33:30]  everybody's,  all comedians love him.  Yeah.  I've never heard  one comedian  not like Otto.  Say I hate that guy,  right?  No,  I mean,  or not think he's funny,  not one comic.  This is what he hates  as a ventriloquist.  He hates when people  not refer to the puppet  as a dummy,  but when they refer to it  as an outside like,  hey,  is George going to drive?  You know,  he really wants to  spit on people.  Does that annoy you?  Is there a way  people refer to your dummies  that really just  annoys the shit out of you?  Well,  it's funny because  people that,  you know,  if they're around me  or us,  you know,  management or whatever, 
[01:34:00]  family,  we start,  notice I said  management before family.  How sad is that?  Smart,  actually.  Family doesn't put you  in arenas.  Everybody refers to  the characters  as if they're  separate people from me.  And at first,  you think,  what is wrong?  But then it just  kind of makes sense.  It's just easier.  You talk about Walter  as if he's a real person  because,  you know,  it's not,  I made Walter say,  it's Walter said.  Right.  Yeah.  And at first,  it's kind of disconcerting.  Well, 
[01:34:30]  the puppets talk  in your book,  too.  Oh,  yeah.  That's creepy,  Jeff.  The publisher and I  went round and round  about that,  and I thought,  I don't know  if this is a good idea,  but then when we started,  when I started doing it,  it's like,  oh,  this is kind of cool  because it breaks the book up.  But,  yeah,  we had little illustrations  of the characters  and they all interject  their own little jokes  and stuff inside there.  Which means you're talking  to yourself in your book.  Well,  doing the audio version  was a pain in the ass  because,  you know,  I'd have to be reading  and then cut into the characters  and it was,  you know,  have you ever read 
[01:35:00]  Out Loud  a 350-page book?  Oh.  It came out  in eight hours on the CD  and then,  but we literally taped,  we had studio time  of like 31 hours of reading  because,  you know,  they go,  oh no,  do that one again.  Damn it.  It's the worst.  Yeah,  it's awful.  Did you do yours,  Jimmy?  I did the first one  on audio  and I,  after,  I never promoted it  because I didn't like,  I should not have allowed  someone as a stand-up  to dictate how I spoke.  Oh,  really?  Like,  you know what I mean?  Like,  slow it down.  That's not the way  it's delivered.  Right.  And then we came home.  Perfect.  How long did it take you 
[01:35:30]  to do yours, Jimmy?  I don't know.  My days.  I was going back in  after the radio.  I can't imagine.  Yeah.  I'm a horrible reader,  Jeff.  It would take me a year.  Right.  My voice always cracks  and finally we just gave up.  We said,  okay,  well the voice crack  and I'll have to stay in there  otherwise.  Yeah,  those little imperfections  makes you,  you know,  it's a good humor.  Why not?  Yeah.  And you broke into movies,  obviously?  Not really.  I mean,  I had a very small,  teeny,  tiny role in that thing.  That's a start.  Can I tell you?  We're talking about  Dinner with Schmucks.  Dinner with Schmucks,  yeah. 
[01:36:00]  You were the only thing  I enjoyed of that movie.  Oh, come on!  I have to say it.  I thought that,  man,  I love that movie.  But your scene  was unbelievable.  You want to explain  your scene in that movie?  Yeah,  the one where  the giant dinner scene  and it's literally,  I guess,  is it 10 or 12 people  sitting at this table  and it took us  two weeks  to tape a scene  that ended up  in the movie  that was probably,  what,  two minutes,  three minutes long?  God knows how long it was.  But,  yeah,  well,  I'm sitting there  with a dummy. 
[01:36:30]  And by the way,  the character,  Jay Roach,  came to me  before we started filming.  He goes,  I want you to be  in the movie  Dinner for Schmucks.  And I go,  what am I?  He goes,  you're a schmuck.  I'm like,  Jay,  he goes,  no,  no,  play yourself,  you'll be fine.  And then I go,  what am I?  He goes,  well,  you're a schmuck,  you're a ventriloquist.  Thank you.  But he's in love  with his own puppet.  Yeah,  exactly.  But he goes,  but don't get to  honest to God,  truth.  And he goes,  I said,  well,  what's the dummy?  He goes,  well,  it's going to be 
[01:37:00]  your wife.  And I said,  oh,  really?  And what's her character?  He goes,  well,  she's a whore.  She's always drunk  and hitting on other men.  And I'm like,  honest to God,  I thought I was being punked.  I'm like,  well,  what's his name?  Ashton Kutcher's going to  jump out any second  and I'm going to be screwed.  But yeah,  that's what he wanted.  Did that make you want to do it  or not want to do it?  Oh,  of course there was that side of me  that really made me want to do it.  Oh,  good.  Oh,  good.  Absolutely.  It worked.  But yeah,  so the character,  and now the character's in the live show  and it's kind of cool  because I've had the male side of things  for so many years  with Walter,  you know,  bagging on women. 
[01:37:30]  And now I've had to hire  a couple of female,  middle-aged female writers  to come in and do the voice,  you know,  write her  because I don't,  you know,  we don't get it.  I got three daughters.  I don't understand their point of view.  You don't get it.  I don't understand their point of view.  We really do have no interest  in what they have to say.  I don't understand what they're thinking,  saying.  They're all drivel.  That's right.  Spanx.  Do you know what Spanx are?  Yes,  I do.  How do you know that?  Because I should be wearing them  with my man tits.  Yeah,  well,  they wrote a Spanx joke  and I'm like,  I sat down at the meeting 
[01:38:00]  and I go,  I don't know what Spanx are.  You're going to have to explain this to me.  Does it kill though?  Oh,  yeah,  it kills.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  women know.  It's like a modern day  kind of a girdle thing.  A girdle-y thing.  Right.  Holds all the,  as she says,  you weren't in the movie a lot,  but it was a relief.  Trust me.  Well,  that's the next step.  We hope,  you know,  I don't know,  our TV show lasted for 10 minutes,  but we learned a lot from that thing.  Who was it on?  What network?  It was on Comedy Central.  But we were doing okay in the ratings 
[01:38:30]  and it was leveling out,  but the show was double the cost  of anything else they had on there,  so it started to make no sense.  Because if the ratings literally  would have had to maintain  double anything they had  for it to pay for itself.  Why did it cost so much  if you had the puppets made already?  Because...  Jeff's pay.  Jeff's pay, right?  Yeah.  No,  that was a chunk of it.  Probably.  No,  that was a chunk.  No,  honestly,  it was a huge cut in pay  because I wasn't doing the road  and the road pays better  than anything.  So,  it's Comedy Central.  Come on. 
[01:39:00]  Exactly.  But,  By the way,  I'm nodding my head like a phony,  like,  yes,  I understand the road pays  better than anything.  Me and Jeff,  you know,  two guys that make  the same amount of money.  I really stink.  I don't know.  But,  no,  we had a lot of people on staff  and it was like,  you know,  we were all,  it wasn't a green screen.  I was operating these characters  from all these different angles  and we had a lot of green screen  in there  and it was,  it just got to be really expensive.  A lot of folks work  and it would have been fun  to keep going.  But,  so now we hope to get into films  and, 
[01:39:30]  you know,  I mean,  there's so many,  we can do some kind of buddy comedy  or an Achmed Christmas,  you know,  thing where he's trying to find  the meaning of Christmas  or something.  There's got to be something  there somewhere.  Yeah,  it sounds like there would be.  Well,  you did a Comedy Central Christmas  I know,  right?  I just saw that.  Yeah,  we did the stand-up two years ago,  the special,  and that went really well  and the DVD,  it's crazy if you go on Amazon  and look,  I mean,  these DVDs have been out  since 06,  07,  and 09,  08,  I don't remember when,  Christmas was 08,  I guess.  Yeah,  but they're still, 
[01:40:00]  when you go to stand-up comedy,  they still have been  in the top 10  for that long.  Wow.  Yeah,  it's nuts.  What a ride.  I don't get it.  Yeah,  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Why?  Why don't you get it?  I don't know,  because,  I mean,  you're massively successful  and you don't get it.  Yeah,  I know,  but it's just,  I mean,  the fans are everything  and they keep coming out  and,  you know,  I do treat it like a business.  But what do you think it is?  I think it's the fact  that I'm,  as a stand-up,  am able to just,  they love the characters  and they love the comedy  and they love the situation  and it's something 
[01:40:30]  completely different  and I'm doing,  I've always felt  that I'm doing stand-up comedy  in dialogue form  and that's the only difference  is most guys are monologists  and I happen to be doing dialogue  and I think that  because of the characters  of what they are,  I'm able to push things  a little further.  I mean,  you know,  you're not going to find  a stand-up comic  dressing up like a terrorist  and jumping around on stage  and saying,  I'm going to kill you.  You know,  his career would last  not very long.  Did you ever do stand-up  without the puppets?  Yeah,  I do my first 10,  15 minutes of the show  but I've never done stand-up.  It's like,  there's too many great guys  out there doing stand-up. 
[01:41:00]  Why do I need to start?  But you do a little bit before.  Yeah,  just to set my character  and let people know  that I'm a person too.  I've never seen  a Jeff Dunham show.  I want to go now.  I haven't either.  But I'm happy for him.  As a fellow comic,  it's always good to see guys  doing 6,000 seats.  Yeah.  I'm looking for a rope  right now for myself.  6,000 seats  on a Tuesday night,  you know.  It's amazing.  Did you ever have to go  through that,  you know,  ventriloquist or crazy thing  growing up?  Yeah.  It's a little awkward  when you're in your teens 
[01:41:30]  with a dummy.  People kind of look...  Oh, yeah.  No, it's sad.  I don't think it's a chick,  Magnus.  No, no, it's a sad thing.  Here's the worst  slash best story.  When I was in junior high,  high school,  I didn't have the $50  to go to the studio  to have my headshots taken.  So I would show up  on school picture day,  I would always show up  with a dummy.  And the guy would go,  what?  And I'd go,  can't I just have 
[01:42:00]  this school picture  taken with a dummy?  The photographer would go,  okay, back up three feet  and take the shot.  And I did that every year  from seventh grade  through twelfth grade.  I was sitting down  with my daughters  a couple years ago  looking at the yearbooks  and they were horrified  to see that every single  school picture I had  with me with a dummy  is the saddest thing ever.  Wow, that is.  It's like realizing  that you're living  with a psychopath.  It's like when  Shelley Duvall  was reading Nicholson's book  and she realized  he was nuts all along.  But see,  the reason I think  I didn't get beat up 
[01:42:30]  on a regular basis  is because I get up  on stage  and I do what  no one else could.  I'd make fun  of the principal,  I'd make fun  of the teachers,  I'd make fun  of the school food.  So I'd make fun  of the stuff  that nobody else  could say.  All through the dummy.  All through the dummy.  So there was a level,  I guess a kind of level  of coolness there  so I didn't get beat up  all the time.  Did you see magic  growing up?  Absolutely.  I took a girl  to the movie Magic.  That was 1978.  That's with Anthony Hopkins,  Burgess Meredith,  and Margaret.  And he, of course,  is the crazy ventriloquist  that ends up killing his...  Fats is the dummy.  That's right.  And I took a girl  to that and she never  spoke to me again 
[01:43:00]  afterwards.  It's a creepy movie.  I don't know  if it holds up.  I haven't seen it  in many years.  I haven't seen it  in a long, long time.  It was great at the time.  Well, the best thing  in the movie, though,  to me, was the trailer.  It was just the dummy.  Abracadabra,  I sit on his knee.  Yeah, yeah.  You're dead.  Yeah, you are dead.  Did he say...  Pocus, you're dead.  We are dead.  Right?  Or we are dead.  Yeah.  Hey, can we see...  I gotta see the dummy.  You gotta see Walter  go to your accent.  See, after all this...  I have to.  You brought it in here.  Yeah.  Do you remember talking...  It's a story I tell all the time 
[01:43:30]  and you probably don't  and that's fine.  Right.  We were doing radio  in Boston  and you called our show  and you were doing  the whole thing.  I think it was Walter.  Right.  And we stopped you  and said,  are you sitting in a hotel room  by yourself  with the dummy  or are you just  doing his lines  and you're like,  uh, yeah, I'm here  with the actual puppet  doing this phone interview.  That was, of course, a lie.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, I never sit alone  in the hotel  but when I go to the studios  I do carry him with me.  You'll do it alone  on the phone?  On the phone, yeah.  You don't actually need 
[01:44:00]  the puppet to do his lines?  No, I don't do that.  I've been meaning  to ask you this for years  because we tell the story  every once in a while.  Well, still the funniest thing  to me, though,  is when I go in the studio  and the engineer  will come in  or whoever,  even the jock  and they'll push the microphone  and they'll get two mics  and push one in front of the dummy.  In front of the dummy.  It's like, you know,  we're all adults here.  There's no real sound  coming out of that puppet.  Sound doesn't come out  of the mouth.  No.  Yeah, but thanks for believing  in the magic.  But we, I don't know,  but when we had Otto  and George on at N.E.W.,  we took a break,  we had a commercial  and we're all just doing  our thing,  what we do, right? 
[01:44:30]  Right.  And we look over  and we see that George  is reading the newspaper  and Otto wasn't.  And the eyes are going  back and forth.  We didn't know Otto  that well at this point.  Yeah.  Like, what is that about it?  And we don't know  if he was fucking with us,  like, I'm going to really  fucking play this up  for these guys.  Yeah.  Well, yeah,  there's a story in that book.  One of the,  at the Ventriloquist convention  one year,  there's a woman  and I called her Fran  in the book.  That was not her name,  but she showed up  at the convention one year  and she had an exact  duplicate of Fats, 
[01:45:00]  full size and everything.  You know,  that head is huge  on that dummy.  So she shows up with it  and she would just  carry this dummy around  everywhere,  to the coffee shop,  everywhere.  And one day  I was walking down  a row of hotel rooms  and happened to glance  over at the open door  and there was Fats  in bed  with the covers pulled up  and the TV was on  and she was walking  out the door by herself.  And I stopped  and I went,  I stopped  and I went,  so Fats  is watching TV.  She goes,  oh,  he loves watching television  and this one  was freaking serious.  And she goes,  and she goes, 
[01:45:30]  and he has,  the best though  is he has a car seat  and he drives around  with me  and I'm like,  this is,  this lady's nutso.  She never came back.  What a cook.  You know what ever  happened to her?  I have no idea.  No idea.  Okay.  Fats killed her.  Yeah, obviously.  What do you think  happens with that  where it's somebody  like really wants  to humanize it  so they don't realize  that they're doing it.  There's got to be  some kind of psychology  that centriloquists  are an odd breed.  Well,  every art,  every whatever,  even stamp collectors,  there's always the weirdos  in the group, 
[01:46:00]  right?  The ones that are  way too serious about it.  And that's what it is.  We have 400 people  that show up every year  and eight of us  are full timers  and the other 392  are the weekend warriors  that do one show a month  and are way too serious about it.  They're not dummies,  they're figures.  You don't have to be,  you don't have to go  to those conventions  anymore, Jeff.  Someone's got to tell you.  Enough of those people,  okay?  You're touring the world now.  Yeah, but I was there,  I grew up at those things,  I learned a lot,  so I do actually go every year  and give a lecture or two.  And he's the king of them,  though, man.  He's the king. 
[01:46:30]  How could you not go somewhere?  There was a time  you were going to the conventions  as a single guy.  Did you get, you know,  some action?  Conventions are known  for this stuff.  You got a good story there.  Do you really want to be the guy  that slept with the nutty ventriloquist?  I don't know.  Not me.  Because I'm not going to find  the chick.  Oh, there's other things.  Yeah, I'm not going to find  the chick ventriloquist.  Oh, he's got to go?  Yeah.  No, there's,  there are couples that show up  that are married couples  that are ventriloquists  that do their act together  and you just want to go,  oh, man, come on. 
[01:47:00]  That's just not,  that's no bueno.  How horrible.  That would be Rich and Bonnie  if they were ventriloquists.  Exactly.  Her with that idiot on her lap.  Yeah.  That would be perfect.  But not to get back to it,  but all this stuff is in the book  and again, I'm very proud.  Oh, no, we're happy for you, Jeff.  This is your first book, right?  Yeah, yeah, and there's,  there's some funny stuff in there.  There's some poignant stuff.  I go through the divorce.  That was, that's always horrible,  especially with three kids involved.  Did she kill you?  Uh-huh.  Did she kill you?  What do you mean,  did she kill me?  Oh, in that part of it?  Oh, it's not.  Knowing that you have three daughters,  did she go a little easy on you? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, no.  It's ugly.  You know, somebody asked me,  somebody asked me the other day,  they said,  say, doing what you do,  what is the most difficult word to say?  And I said, well, alimony.  Thank you.  You knew her before you were famous?  Like, I mean,  did you know her before you were really famous?  Oh, yeah, I was on Carson  and all that stuff long before I met her.  So at least all these characters and stuff were established.  But she helped build, you know, the dummies, right?  Man, she helped write the act, right?  And went through the same thing, Jeff.  Yeah, I went through that. 
[01:48:00]  You can speak your language.  Isn't that right?  It was fascinating.  So you were no one before she came into your life.  I was putting in air conditioning  and heating ductwork.  But were you married?  Were you really?  Yeah.  Oh, see, now, that wasn't the way it was with me.  I was off and going  and everything was going off and sailing  long before I met her.  Well, thank God you had a prenup, though.  At least you had that to take care of you.  Oh, dude.  Why do you have to grab a knife?  We married for love, of course.  Did she do commercials for the lottery?  Her and my wife?  Exactly.  Ding, ding, ding. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, he got killed.  That's why he's torn the world.  Trying to get his mind back.  Well, that is a dad.  It does suck.  That check every morning is like,  son of a gun.  Damn, at least I was able to leave my dummy behind,  though you still have to pick one up.  That's right.  Yeah.  Are you still friends at all,  or is that tough?  Oh.  She is.  I have moved on,  and I'm very happy.  I have a girlfriend.  We've been dating a while.  Nice.  And we go everywhere  and do everything together,  and it's a blast.  And the other side of things is just,  you know,  I don't want to say too much. 
[01:49:00]  My three daughters are still there,  but there's a bit of anger there.  Some people have a tougher time moving on.  Okay.  In life.  In life.  Exactly right.  That's cool.  Thank you, Jim.  That's perfect.  Some people have a tougher time.  I don't know if you can answer this.  Who ended the marriage?  It was kind of mutual.  So why the anger, then?  One side's always a little more mutual than the other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  One side can still go out  and fuck a lot younger people  because one side makes millions.  Honest to God,  two years later,  yesterday morning, 
[01:49:30]  she actually tried to run me off the road.  Wow.  See, that's...  Two years later.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Two years after the fact.  I dropped one of my kids off at school.  She dropped off the other one,  and I look in my rearview mirror  three miles away from school,  and I go,  surely not.  Here comes this big old escalator  right up my butt  and zoom right in front of me.  She didn't try and run me off the road,  but she certainly cut me off very quickly,  and I'm like,  oh, come on!  Hey, what the hell are you doing?  Yeah, that's right.  Walter started yelling out the window.  They're saying that you have to go.  We have some big yellow letters. 
[01:50:00]  I guess you have other press.  The book is called...  We didn't get to see the dummy.  Oh, we get to see Walter.  We'll come back.  You come back with Walter.  You guys were awesome.  Thanks very much.  All by myself.  Is it out today?  Tuesday is usually book today.  Yeah, and you know,  there's nothing else going on today.  It's a perfect time to release a book.  It's a slow news day.  True.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Election day.  My last one came out November 4th, 2008.  Obama's election day.  That was a good day to do a signing.  Oops.  Made a bunch of suicidal white people.  Jeff is promoting the book. 
[01:50:30]  He'll be doing a signing if you want to meet him.  There's obviously going to be a hell of a line.  Tomorrow, it's a great place.  Borders in Columbus Circle, 7 p.m.  It's in the Time Warner building.  It's all indoor waiting,  so you're not going to be stuck outside.  It's a great, great place to go to a signing.  Tomorrow night, 7 p.m.  Awesome.  Here in New York.  Thanks, guys.  Are you doing one today at all or no?  No, the signing is just tomorrow.  Okay, just tomorrow.  Was it tomorrow or tomorrow?  Tomorrow night.  Jeff Dunham, everyone.  Jeff Dunham.  Thanks a lot, Jeff.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  See you soon.  Okay, Anthony.  Mornings.  Ron and Fez.  Middays.  On the virus. 
[01:51:00]  Sirius XM.  Right on about Jeff Dunham.  I liked him.  He was great.  Yeah, I liked that he didn't do any dummy act stuff.  Yeah, he's just talking about himself.  He's more edgy than we think.  I liked that.  Although he turned the corner with the terrorist puppet, so.  Before that, he was very safe, I thought, in his act, right? 
[01:51:30]  I never saw his act, honestly.  I don't know.  I never have either, I'll tell you the truth.  I got to hit this tonight, the Jim Florentine Roast, 8 o'clock at Comics on 9th Avenue and 14th Street.  A whole bunch of us are roasting Florentine, 212-524-2500.  Call after 12, or just go to comicsny, C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  That's tonight, 8 o'clock at Comics.  We are roasting Jim Florentine, Eddie, Don Jameson, Voss is hosting, Bonnie, Otto, and George, Sherrod. 
[01:52:00]  There's a shitload of people.  It's a great lineup.  That's going to be brutal.  And the proceeds are going to Geraldo's kids, which is a great cause.  So, you know.  Sure thing.  Because he kind of checked out early.  Wow, why would Florentine, like, put himself up for that?  They've been talking about it for a while.  That is a brutal crowd to have roast you.  Yeah, it's not a bunch of nice people.  Yikes.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, that'll be fun.  Right on.  Fun.  Absolutely.  All right. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, we got to talk about Randy Quaid.  He's lost his mind.  Who knew he was this crazy?  I mean, the stories have been coming out for the last year or two, but he was on Good Morning America.  Just speaking nonsense.  Yeah, he's been in some trouble.  I guess he was in a house with his wife that they didn't own.  Squatting?  Squatting.  He had gotten arrested for that.  They went to Canada to try to, and then we're asking for asylum in Canada. 
[01:53:00]  Like, political asylum.  They didn't want to be brought back to the U.S. because of these Hollywood hit squads.  These, what was he calling them?  Star Whackers.  Star Whackers.  The people are trying to kill him.  And for what reason?  I don't know.  I think he explains it in some of this inane babbling.  Yeah.  The Quades think there's a conspiracy against them.  Listen to this.  From Good Morning America.  I agree wholeheartedly. 
[01:53:30]  The Quade conspiracy on my next show.  People noticed that you supported Obama in a commercial.  Did I?  No, I said I agree with him.  I said get out there and vote.  Yeah, no.  You supported Obama.  One guy writes, one guy from Baltimore writes, wow, how did Anthony do that read without running  out of the studio spraying bullets everywhere?  Because I'm a professional.  It said it's the AOL.com thing.  It said a new feature that gives an open mic to President Obama, Hollywood, and everyone 
[01:54:00]  in between.  And then later on.  You don't want Obama to have an open mic, though.  It said an exclusive.  President Obama with an exclusive AOL open mic on the election and the importance of getting  the vote out.  And that's all I'm saying is, it is very important to get the vote out.  Get it out.  And get out his Democratic majority in the House.  His people.  His peeps.  Get him out.  They noticed, though.  Yeah, I know.  They noticed that. 
[01:54:30]  Anytime I have to say Obama without going, ugh, after it.  I know.  They noticed that you probably had a tough time with that read.  I'm a professional.  I rise above.  Here's Randy Quaid on GMA.  He's a Golden Globe winner, best known as Cousin Eddie, in Christmas Vacation.  But lately, actor Randy Quaid has watched his own life play out like a bad Hollywood movie.  He and his wife, Evie, have been involved in a series of bizarre events that have led them  here to Canada, where they sat down for an exclusive interview with GMA. 
[01:55:00]  We are refugees.  I mean, that's essentially what it is.  Hollywood refugees.  Seeking to be left alone by the criminals in America.  The couple fled north after police...  Nutty.  Nutty motherfuckers.  God.  I love how the reporter's got to sit there and straight face just nod like, yes, yes,  you're right.  Why does anybody care where they are?  Like, who gives a fuck if they're in Canada?  Because they have to come back to the U.S. to answer for charges.  Oh, what charges?  Weird charges.  That he does shitty movies? 
[01:55:30]  That he's awful and unwatchable and looks like Rob Reiner?  There's a few...  Oh, yeah, he's not that awful.  He stinks.  There are a few...  Oh, you're hurting a lot of the...  Randy Quaid?  What's he done?  You're hurting the vacation people out there.  Oh, please.  I hate this wacky characters and everything.  You don't like him.  Fucking hate him.  He's a way better actor than I am, but who isn't?  Independence Day.  Daddy's home.  Shut up.  I fucking hate him in everything.  You're not a Randy Quaid fan either?  No.  Not even in the vacation movies?  No, I liked him in, like, I think the one where they went to Vegas. 
[01:56:00]  That was kind of funny.  That's the...  Where are the white bucks?  Is Vegas vacation good?  No.  It's not, but he had a couple of funny lines in it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I liked his characters.  His character.  Characters.  North, after police say they broke into, trashed, and then lived in someone else's home  in Santa Barbara.  In this audio obtained by TMZ, Evie Quaid can be heard screaming during her arrest.  Will you show me this? 
[01:56:30]  My, my, my, my dog, my dog, my dog, my dog, my dog, my dog, my dog, my dog, my dog.  She says she became so upset because she claims they are the real owners of the house and the  incident is all part of a larger conspiracy.  I genuinely feel like these people are trying to kill us.  Who?  The Hollywood insiders, Opie.  And how could they say it's their house? 
[01:57:00]  Was it their house?  There's a plot to kill the Quaids.  I've seen it before.  I'm driving.  Let's talk to the Quaids.  Shut up.  Okay.  What have you got on the Quaids?  Well, Governor, I see that there's some people in Hollywood that want them dead.  Ah, proof positive right there.  The Negro woman said it.  Oh, he's such a tool.  I was watching his specialist show on Area 51 over the weekend. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, just horrible.  I went to Area 50 and made a left.  And there it was.  Did he say that?  They guided me to Area 52 thinking I couldn't count.  They were right.  I got up to Area 70 before I said oops.  It was terribly proof.  Nothing again.  And they kept going before commercials.  They're like, and when we return, Jesse, the governor, goes head to head with the security 
[01:58:00]  at Area 51.  And then they kept teasing it.  And Jesse faces down the gun barrel of security at the border of Area 51.  And then they got there.  They finally get it.  They finally get to the point.  And Jesse's like, if I step over this imaginary line, they could shoot a governor?  No.  And then he goes, well, we decided it was too much of a chance and turned around. 
[01:58:30]  They were teasing how he faced down the guns the whole time.  What an asshole.  Yuck.  So they're going to shoot a former governor?  That's unbelievable.  Oh, God.  What happens at Area 51?  I'm a former moron.  A governor.  Oh, wait.  I got it backwards.  I'm a moron.  A fighter.  A Navy SEAL.  Even though they weren't called that when I was in.  Yes.  What, the UDT? 
[01:59:00]  Underwater demolition?  UDT.  Underwater demolition.  Or in G.I.  Joe vernacular, it was a frog man.  What an ass.  Anyway, I was watching that.  What happens at Area 51 now?  You're just not allowed in that area?  Of course.  And it's been that way for years.  They built classified military weaponry.  A lot of it does go under Congress's feet.  They don't know about a lot of these things.  They're covert projects. 
[01:59:30]  You can't, if anything's been proven, Congress cannot keep fucking secrets.  When you're trying to build something, you have to give government certain latitude as far as secrecy goes.  And when it comes to national security and weaponry, especially what's come out of Groom Lake, Area 51, Skunk Works, it's some of the best, most amazing machines ever built on the face of this earth.  And the only reason they were able to do that is because it wasn't funded by Congress and it wasn't this pork barrel shit and arguing and bullshit. 
[02:00:00]  It's the CIA, the military saying, we need this, build it.  Do you think if Congress had to step in and fucking have all of them had to say in the Manhattan Project, we ever would have had an atomic bomb?  Of course not.  Fuck no.  And it's the same thing that's been going on at Area 51 for years.  There's no fucking flying saucers.  There's no bullshit.  It's heavy security because it's a private installation that builds classified weapons. 
[02:00:30]  Shut up, Jesse.  You didn't prove shit.  I proved.  What's there, little green men?  He actually said, little green men.  Shut up.  Go back to Mexico, you fucking unpatriotic cock.  He's just a boob.  He is a boob.  That's kind of cliche, huh?  Yeah.  Is that the worst cliche ever?  Dummy.  Hey, Troy likes that show?  Anth is on the Area 51 payroll.  Wait, Troy likes conspiracy with Ventura? 
[02:01:00]  Does he like it like I like it?  I received a communication that Troy disagreed with Anthony and that he thought it was a really good episode.  And Jesse and one of his cronies faced the people that were coming off the plane.  Now, the plane leaves Vegas.  It's about a 90-minute flight.  No, it's like 100 and some odd miles.  I'm not even sure.  It's close enough to Vegas.  They get on this plane.  It's workers.  And it's like, what's with the secret Area 51 airline that takes the employees into Area 51? 
[02:01:30]  It's like, yeah, they don't want to commute from Vegas to Area 51 through an open desert.  So the fucking government supplies them with transportation.  It's not some big, they're not on there fucking talking.  They're probably talking about what you got for lunch there, Pete.  Maybe they're bringing in the aliens that way.  Yes, the aliens.  Why are you dressed like that?  We do morning radio.  It's freezing back there.  I'm freezing my ass.  You don't like that he's dressed like Fonzie's nephew, Spike? 
[02:02:00]  Spike!  You got like a leather jacket on like you...  Did you come from a bar or something?  No, this is a jacket I wear.  This is how you dress in the morning?  Well, this is the jacket I wear in.  It seems exhausting.  It's like a leather blazer or something.  It does.  Like brown leather jacket.  There's nothing wrong with it.  No, thank you.  Thanks, man.  That's cool.  Sam?  Coming from someone wearing military garb.  Yeah, he's just like Schwarzenegger in the first Terminator.  You got like a black dress-up shirt you'd wear out. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  And then a leather jacket over it.  He looks like Tyler Durden.  Was it?  Yeah, you got a little Tyler Durden.  That's good.  What's wrong with wearing a button-up shirt?  Everything.  I don't know.  Look how we dress.  Just fit in, will you?  It's different.  Troy, you could just fucking lay in and say,  hey, at least one person wants to look good here in the morning.  Well, you know, I mean, it's nothing wrong with taking a little pride in your appearance.  You know what I mean?  He looks like Tyler Durden.  Look, he's wearing Tyler Durden's fucking shirt.  That's how you came to work.  Oh, that's perfect. 
[02:03:00]  Good call.  That's how you came to work.  Damn.  I'll take that as a compliment.  Yeah, but all right.  Whatever.  It's fine.  Whatever.  I'd go the opposite.  I'd like to...  I have smelly fucking sweatpants half the time.  I'd like to look like Tyler Durden, too, but at fucking 4.15 in the morning, I don't give a fuck.  Right, right, right.  Unless you've been up all night.  I'm not blow-drying my hair and trying to find out what leather looks best with this shirt.  But it's not a conscious decision.  It's not like, oh, I've got to look fucking awesome.  It's just, this is the jacket that I wear and I put it on and I leave.  Troy doesn't...  He sleepwalks and blow-drys his hair at the same time when he's leaving. 
[02:03:30]  He doesn't even realize it.  No, I just don't wash my hair.  That's the way it was from yesterday.  You don't have greasy hair?  No.  I can't go one day without washing my stupid hair.  It gets all greasy and shit.  I just get up and just go.  Fuck it.  Get up and go.  You like conspiracy with Jesse Ventura?  Well, I mean, it's bad acting.  It's terrible.  But I don't know.  I kind of get off on some of the conspiracy shit, you know?  You don't see every single episode as loaded with just bullshit, teases for things that  never materialize, uncredible witnesses that he digs up out of nowhere that if you Google 
[02:04:00]  their names, which I do, I Google their names, I see what their background is, they all are  not involved with anything having to do with the subject matter.  And they don't ever seem real.  They seem like they're acting.  They seem professional speakers.  You know what I mean?  They speak very clearly.  Why is Sam making a commotion?  He's bullshitting because he's in the studio with you guys.  No, I just said I liked it.  That's why I came in here.  We were able to turn you that quickly? 
[02:04:30]  No, no, no.  Is that Sam's going to get it?  This must be some kind of mind control.  You've mind controlled Troy.  We're finding more pictures of Tyler Durden for you, Troy.  That's you.  That's how you come to work.  You come to work like Tyler Durden.  It's great.  I'm not offended by that in the least.  You trying to pick up chicks here or what?  He's always got to be ready.  You know what I mean?  Troy didn't shower because he was up all night making soap.  Yes.  Sam what?  He's a big fan of the show.  He loves the show.  And he completely buys everything.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:05:00]  That's not true.  That's not true.  Did you see the Area 51 one?  I did.  I did.  Now, what was your take on that?  What was your take on everything?  What Jesse was doing?  What the witnesses were saying?  People that have been on the inside.  But see, I like the idea of that.  I like the idea of something crazy is going on there.  Everyone likes the idea.  You know, I love the idea.  I would love to think that flying saucers crashed at Roswell.  They were brought into Area 51 and they still are going through the technology and just using 
[02:05:30]  it for our own military now.  And no, I don't have any.  You might as well say the tooth fairy is there and Santa Claus is there because it's the same  shit.  Right.  But why won't they let you into there?  Because it's a secret military installation.  So it's kind of cool to think about what could possibly be going on there.  In the real world, absolutely.  If you look back at when the F-117 was being made and think about a stealth machine that 
[02:06:00]  cannot be seen by radar, that's fantastic.  Sure.  And now that we know it existed and they built it there, of course it's amazing.  And what are they building now?  I would love to know.  But you know what?  We don't know because it's secret.  It's military stuff.  It's not spaceships.  And they don't have time for a goofy TV show.  They're busy working.  Just because Jesse's knocking on their door doesn't mean they have to let them in.  Open up.  I was a former governor.  I should come in and see everything.  And no one's going to get shot for walking over an imaginary line. 
[02:06:30]  That's just dramatic bullshit.  So you mean to tell me the fire fight would start and he goes, I'm going to turn around  because we still have 20 miles of open field fire to go through.  Like they'd just shoot Jesse the body right there as he steps over a line.  The truck would come down.  They'd be going, what are you doing here?  There's signs that say you're not allowed to have cameras.  Now it does say use of deadly physical force is, what's the word I'm looking for? 
[02:07:00]  Authorized.  Yes.  They're authorized to use it.  It doesn't mean that you step over the line and fucking cyber guns that they set up like  in a video game start going off and kill you.  But they do have the right if they see some guy going, oh, no, Bob, running with a fucking  gun belt on, a bomb belt on, they could shoot him.  But Jesse with a camera crew, I don't think they're going to open fire on Jesse the body.  You know that Troy is a 9-11 truther, right?  No, no, no.  I never claimed to be a truther. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Get out.  You're putting words in my mouth.  We've had this.  Gatekeepers, man.  The gatekeepers.  He wants to know what happened to whatever, Tower 7 or whatever.  It's Building 7.  Yeah, he wants to know what happened.  Got hit by giant chunks of building.  He doesn't believe it.  Started on fire and fell down.  Well, I mean, that's what some people say.  Some people say it's a good thing.  See, I don't know what you did to say that.  There's only proof that that happened, by the way.  Well, it's one of those things where I'm not a demolition expert.  I haven't done the research myself.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm not either. 
[02:08:00]  But I am.  I haven't brought it up, Danny, so I'm just here defending it.  So tell Sam to shut the fuck up.  For years.  I'm just saying.  I mean, you can't say something like that and say, well, I'm not a demolition expert.  Well, then you should.  So I'm not allowed to find it fascinating?  You can find it fascinating.  So what's wrong with that?  You shouldn't find it truthful.  Who's finding it truthful?  He put words in my mouth.  He's the one calling me his truther.  Go ahead.  Ready?  You shouldn't be conspiring that Building 7 fell for any other reason if you're not a demo expert.  Well, I'm just saying I look at both sides and I go, well, they make some interesting points here.  Have you ever watched any shows on Discovery? 
[02:08:30]  And this is pre-2001, pre-9-11.  It isn't now something that's just being set up for propaganda.  Did you ever watch what demolition crews go through?  Watch specials on demolition crews?  Do you understand the work it takes to demolish in a controlled explosion that brings a building down like a pancake, what it takes a demolition crew to do that work, the destruction they have to do prior to planting explosives, drilling holes in walls, cutting through I-beams, putting shape-charge explosives by I-beams so that they shear them off? 
[02:09:00]  It's not something you could load in disguised as a janitor and set up with all the walls still up so when people go to work in the morning, they don't know that there's fucking a 10-foot wide cable going out to boxes that control an explosion.  It's not feasible.  The better answer is it was damaged when two huge skyscrapers fell down from Arabs hitting it with airplanes and then later, because of fire and structural weaknesses, fell down. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, that's fine.  And I understand what you're saying.  I just have a problem.  With the truth.  My problem is I trust nobody.  So what people tell me as this is what's happened, I just naturally question it.  Like structural engineers and popular mechanics.  But like I said, I haven't done the research, so I don't know.  I'm not here to do it.  But there are a bunch of different people.  It's not like you're listening to the government officials have told you this. 
[02:10:00]  It's like engineers.  The average Joe that works at a fucking welding shop knows the principles and makeup of steel and temperatures.  And there's just, it's been a cross-section of people that have said, this is why these buildings fell.  The only people that refute it are people that have nothing.  There is no solid proof.  It's these blurry pictures of something that they say. 
[02:10:30]  Or, wow, this isn't shaped like an airplane at the Pentagon because it hit at a fucking 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed.  They take pictures of holes that were punched in the wall by firemen and say, why is this hole so small?  It was a missile.  It's all just bullshit on one side and then facts that are backed up by multiple sources on the other side.  I'd rather go with the factual part than the made-up part. 
[02:11:00]  That's all.  Why is he saying he has questions, though?  Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's anything wrong with questioning it.  And like I said, I haven't done the research.  I've looked at both sides.  But would it be fair to say that you prefer to not do the research?  All I'm saying is I don't know.  I really don't know.  Are you saying this is part of Project Mayhem?  Is that what you're saying?  I think it's part of Project Mayhem.  You know, I think I did see a smiley face in WTC7.  I saw that for a split second.  Right before it went down.  I saw a yellow smiley face.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I don't go down to Ground Zero and pick it and say all this bullshit. 
[02:11:30]  It's just like I don't think there's anything wrong with questioning what happened.  I went to Ground One right next door.  I got a good look, though.  And I enjoy the documentaries.  I enjoy it.  I'm fascinated by all of it, really.  And I enjoy the conspiracy parts of it.  I'm not saying that they're true or they're not.  If you look at it at entertainment value and think, wow, it would be fun to think something like that's going on.  That's one thing.  But Jesse sending his team out, which, by the way, is a team of horrific actors. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, they're horrible.  They know nothing.  And the witnesses he gets, it was embarrassing when that black chick knocked on the van door.  Yeah.  And it opens up and goes, come in.  It sounded like fucking Hannibal Lecter, this mysterious guy in a white van in the middle of the desert, is giving her information on who to talk to.  And it's like, I'm here alone and I'm scared to knock on the door.  So, alone, you got a camera crew and a fucking boom mic operator and a gaffer and probably a big fucking bruiser guy that carries the shit. 
[02:12:30]  Troy doesn't watch for fun, though.  He watches because he thinks that's closer to getting to the bottom of things than the official story.  Yeah.  That's true.  And why is Jesse kind of a pussy?  Why didn't he walk over the line?  Yeah.  To show what happens if you walk over the line.  It wasn't worth it.  I would have had to walk another 20 miles.  But I'm not doing it.  I'm driving.  He's kind of like Fonzie, though.  He never gets into the actual action.  He is exactly like Fonzie.  We bring up the Fonzie thing all the time, but Jesse's kind of Fonzie. 
[02:13:00]  Fonzie never would step over the line, either.  Look at all the shit going on around WTC7.  Look at all the shit going on around it.  It's surrounded by collapse of buildings and fire.  Plus, I don't think that it fucked up the foundation a little bit.  Couldn't have been damaged?  No.  There's just an entire city falling around it.  Looks like they got to the bottom of that myth.  One picture proves a lot there. 
[02:13:30]  I love the people that go, and it wasn't even damaged by the buildings falling.  It's like in the epicenter of the buildings falling.  It was just a matter of time.  How did it not fall down right away?  Yeah.  It's a miracle it didn't fall immediately.  That's what I'm looking into.  I guess what they say is it fell at free fall speed.  That's what the...  Oh, the free fall speed argument is correct.  They didn't say that?  That's not what they said, didn't they?  I'd like to take a truther and throw him off a building and see how fast he falls and then measure it against WTC7. 
[02:14:00]  I love why people go all the time, they go, oh, did you see it come down?  It looked just like a controlled demolition.  Yeah.  It's like, well, have you ever seen a building come down that wasn't a controlled demolition?  How do you know what it looks like to compare it to?  Yeah.  But if it was structural damage, you would think that it wouldn't come down like a...  Like a building falling down?  Like a fall into its footprint.  That's what they're saying.  Like a building falling down to me.  Whoa.  Ooh.  Ooh.  It's a very challenging observation, Randall.  People like to...  It's just one of a lot of things.  It's one of those key phrases that conspiracy theorists about 9-11 say because they've heard 
[02:14:30]  it said or they've read it in text.  But in actuality and in practice, sure.  Did it look like that?  Perhaps.  Have you ever seen a building come down that wasn't part of a controlled demo to compare  it to?  Once something starts falling, it's just going to fall straight.  It's just a building falling down, so you have nothing to compare it to.  My question is really simple.  If you're going to take out the Twin Towers, why would you have to also take out Building  7?  Well, I mean...  That's what the CIA was.  Because there was a file folder in there.  I can tell you what they're saying.  What's the theory there?  Because it doesn't make sense to me. 
[02:15:00]  Well, a lot of people say that the operation had taken place there and that was the building  for...  And again, I'm just saying what people are saying, Danny, as Danny's like freaking out  over here.  I'm not freaking out.  I'm just countering you.  It's just saying that that's where the CIA was and that's where possibly the operation  had been orchestrated.  So they would now have to destroy that building to make sure there's no evidence.  That's good to operate right next to the place you're blowing up.  And why blow up your own office?  Who does that?  Who blows up the...  Who allows their office to fall down?  Get smart. 
[02:15:30]  And not knowing if all your paperwork...  Because if the building falls, your paperwork gets blown all over the place.  Who does that?  Your paperwork.  How do we cover up the crime?  Knock the building down, let the firemen pick it up.  That makes no sense.  You figure that building would be kept intact and they could guard this shit.  Yeah.  Get big safes.  Right.  You don't knock it down and let stuff fly all out.  Why is he saying these things?  Do it from somewhere far away.  But what's wrong with questioning anything?  Like, why do you have to be always being...  Oh, you're a good question. 
[02:16:00]  You're allowed to.  Why would...  Do you always have to believe what that tells you?  No, no, no.  We do.  I'm not.  You know, and...  And by that, he was pointing at...  We did...  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, it's okay.  I was going to do a dumb joke, but he was...  We do question things.  I do.  And from what I've looked into, after questioning things, you get answers.  And the answers I got were all reasonable that terrorists, Muslim extremists, flew planes into buildings, and they collapsed. 
[02:16:30]  I hope you're right.  It's so much...  I really do.  I hope you're right.  I would say I'm 99.99 and then keep the nines going.  Infinity.  Yeah.  Right.  On this one.  Nine repeating.  Yes, yes, yes.  Infinity.  Because if the operation was that important, the CIA would never allow something like a flight not taking off on time or a passenger bringing down a plane like they did the third one or the fourth one.  They would never leave that stuff to chance. 
[02:17:00]  Like everything went as planned.  Like the CIA's operation...  Could be covered up if the two buildings collapse and then they demolish World Trade Center 7.  Instead of, A, just doing it from a different location, why would they leave it to chance that one of the planes...  Say one of the planes didn't take off.  Right.  Mechanical difficulty where there's a problem at the airport or a fucking weather...  Happens.  ...or an engine light goes off and they've got to turn around.  Then they've got a fucking 1,100-foot building filled with explosives. 
[02:17:30]  Now, how do you explain that?  How stupid does that look?  Now they've got to send people in to take them all out.  Unions get paid.  It's like, oh, it's an invisible plane.  It doesn't make sense.  Nobody who could pull off this genius plot would do it in that horse shit way.  And they hit it with the planes and then waited a perfect amount of time where people would have thought like that...  And let people get out and...  Why not just go, wow, we fucked you.  We got a bunch of people and blew up these buildings.  That's why I don't like conspiracy theorists in general because they're so married to the idea of it. 
[02:18:00]  They're not being honest when they say they're looking for the truth.  They'd rather make the truth their idea than use the facts that they find to make the truth.  Well, I don't think they ignore the facts.  They do ignore the facts because I think if you start to pay attention to the facts and pay attention to common sense,  then you've distanced yourself from that kind of movement and now you can't be a part of it anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's this collective thing where you feel like you're a part of this thing.  Yeah, man, I'm part of it, man. 
[02:18:30]  He's right, though.  And then when you lose that, now you're out of the club.  So you'd rather not do the research and you'd rather not pay attention to the common sense facts because you want to stay a part of that crew.  You don't want to be like Edward Norton in American History X when he goes back to the party after he was in prison.  And I think after Alex Jones was on, one of you guys had said something about, you know, nobody ever says when somebody proves, when somebody says something,  none of the conspiracy theorist guys ever go, oh, that's a really good point. 
[02:19:00]  They just don't.  No, no, no.  That's an excellent point.  They always have an answer for it.  And the answer is so vague and not backed up by facts.  And that's why I have a hard time believing them as well.  But all I'm saying is I enjoy both sides.  I enjoy just an entertainment value of what Alex Jones does or what some of these documentaries do.  I enjoy the idea of, you know.  Sam just sits back there going, no.  I don't know what you're trying to say. 
[02:19:30]  Hold on.  Sam, what is he trying to say?  Yeah, exactly.  Troy is the guy because he gave you the answers to the questions factually and you responded by going, well, I hope that's the case.  That is the vague conspiracy theorist answer.  No, it's the truth.  I would like to believe that that didn't happen.  I would like to believe that our government wouldn't do that to us.  I would really like to believe that.  You ever hear of the Gulf of Tonkin incident?  But I don't know.  I don't know.  But let me ask you a question.  Even though the military does black ops and all that, we got that. 
[02:20:00]  What guys are they getting to wire two 1,100-foot buildings that are keeping it?  Abu Ghraib couldn't be kept a secret.  These dumb motherfuckers were texting photos of soldiers of the Iraqis in pyramids.  Nothing is a secret anymore.  They had it made and they blew it.  Nobody would have ever known.  They just had to shut their mouths and not text each other.  And they sent pictures and somebody ratted.  Someone would have been like with a stick of dynamite. 
[02:20:30]  Look, I'm at the World Trade Center putting it in a beam.  Who the fuck is sitting on this?  Who the fuck is on Facebook?  Who's sitting on this?  How many notifications I got?  Oh, Al-Qaeda likes this.  I think if that guy vomiting beer out of his nose has been around since 1994, I think something  probably would have surfaced by now.  Yes.  I love when these fucking dumb motherfuckers use language they heard from JFK, Oliver Stone.  They use the term stand down. 
[02:21:00]  That's from JFK, Oliver Stone.  Stand down.  Norad was told to stand down.  Were they?  Yeah, were they?  You dumb child.  Shut up.  They weren't.  They weren't.  It's false flag terrorism.  How dare you, sir?  Such idiocy.  And I always know when they're repeating facts, and not to get on JFK, but I always know when  they're repeating Oliver Stone facts, it's like, I know you saw the movie.  I know you think Mr. X was one person, you dumb motherfucker, but he wasn't. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  It just drives me nuts when you hear people just repeating things.  And I was interested to know, because the Pentagon, look, they raised some interesting  questions.  I'm not saying he's wrong.  But then after hearing the explanation, and hearing conspiracy theorists, I just completely  believed the real explanations, because to me they were factual.  And the conspiracy theorists, and I listened to them.  They came on this show, because I remember bringing it up, and saying, let's interview  one of these guys.  And I hated them so much, because I was trying to be open-minded and go, well, maybe they have 
[02:22:00]  a point.  But then when presented with a fact, I listened to how these little fucking baby boys acted,  and they didn't act like me when I had a fact.  You understand?  I really wanted to be open-minded about it.  Your facts weren't facts.  That was shit that was fed to you by the government.  What they know, that's fact, and there's no telling them any difference.  I simply, I really wasn't sure why the plane looked like that going into the Pentagon. 
[02:22:30]  So, I wanted to ask.  And their explanation, I just thought, was childish.  And I believed...  Because it's a missile.  It wasn't a plane.  I just believed people...  That plane landed in Cleveland.  And then we were talking to them on the street, and the one little girl, God bless her, needing  to fit in, probably was molested soul.  But saying things...  I said, what about the voice recordings?  Those are people using voice?  It's like, you little child.  Do you really think that their families are fooled? 
[02:23:00]  What about the first and the last names being left on the answering machines?  Yeah.  Because they were leaving their last will.  Yeah.  They knew they were going to die, you dummy.  You've never heard of a voice synthesizer?  Oh, wow.  You've never heard of a voice synthesizer?  How do you list...  You've never heard of a phaser?  And I guess it's just impossible to get cell service on the 90th floor of the World Trade Center?  Yeah, yeah.  I guess if I go up to the 90th floor, I can't get a cell signal?  I would only believe that if they all had iPhones.  Then I would believe the conspiracy would never happen.  Yes, because we all know.  But a plane zooming through the building tops of Manhattan, I believe you could get a signal. 
[02:23:30]  Tell you the truth.  Silly.  I think you can get a signal.  I just hated the conspiracy theories that we talked to.  Yeah, that's great.  That's cool.  Yeah.  You know?  Debunking 9-11 minutes.  But every time, whoever puts this out, there's somebody that can contradict it.  You've probably never seen the History Channel special about the popular mechanics thing.  But I'm sure you've seen Lose Change about three or four times, right?  I would love to watch it.  Have you seen Lose Change?  I saw the first version.  Have you seen the second version?  I never saw the second version.  Have you seen Zeitgeist and all that shit?  No, I don't even know what that is.  By the way, when Jesse was... 
[02:24:00]  Lose Change!  When he was at Ground Zero.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why did he not know this stuff when it happened?  Why did he...  By the way, Jesse says he never looks at computers.  I don't own a computer.  Yeah.  Well, then how have you watched all these documentaries?  Somebody handed you a videotape?  My crack team shows them to me in my conference room.  That's very dark.  But it's a set.  Didn't he come...  When did Jesse start talking about the 9-11 conspiracy?  When did this ex-governor, ex-Navy SEAL jump on the fucking college-age mentality?  When I was offered money to talk about it. 
[02:24:30]  I want to know when he jumped on that bandwagon.  Because he did not say it September 12, 2001.  And he didn't say it all through 2001, I don't believe.  He was on fucking...  He was there.  He went down to Ground Zero, and he didn't say it.  Hey, we got someone that wants to straighten your ass out, Anthony.  Dave in Virginia.  That a boy, Dave.  Straighten me out.  Kill him.  Let's go, Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, listen, I love you guys.  Man, you guys had the expert on your show,  and you didn't even ask him about it.  Who?  Listen, Jesse Ventura admitted that he's not the knowledge that you need to explain this to you. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Okay?  He says he is the person that gets on the media because he's accepted.  All right.  But Alex Jones, who you had on your show,  if you would have asked him about this, he would have straightened you out.  He is the fat man.  Do you remember...  Hold on, hold on.  Alex, I liked Alex.  Well, let's book Alex Jones.  Hold on.  Dude, I liked Alex Jones.  He would have gladly talked about it.  Well, dude, relax.  You're on the phone.  We're talking to you.  I know.  What was I talking to Alex Jones about where I was trying to... 
[02:25:30]  Alex Jones, look, he's a smart guy, but he's a performer as well.  Mm-hmm.  And when he was talking about certain things like...  He was a patriot, man.  Do you want to just keep babbling through what I'm trying to respond to you?  I'm sorry to over-talk to you.  Go ahead, go ahead.  I'm not saying he's not a patriot.  I didn't say he should be put in an internment camp.  I am saying he's an entertainer.  What I'm saying is, I was trying to pin him down.  He said that somebody offered him, I believe it was for the 9-11 stuff, they offered him  a lot of money to come along.  And again, I'm not trying to misquote the guy, but I was like, well, who did that? 
[02:26:00]  And he wouldn't name the person.  And I'm like, for somebody whose whole thing is to uncover conspiracies, one of those major  guys came to him and asked him to come along, and he refused, and he won't name them out  of some sense of honor, of not breaking trust?  It's like, what are you talking about?  That's backing up a fact.  What's that?  Why is that important?  Somebody who is...  Because it's backing up your sources.  Because that's somebody who...  If somebody who's in on the conspiracy, or who knows about the conspiracy on that level, 
[02:26:30]  and who wants you...  Even if it's not 9-11, if it's banking, and wants you to come along, and you don't expose  them?  If you don't, then it's just you talking...  So many of them, and they're so rich.  I could make shit up and say, yeah, it's a source I have that I can't reveal.  And that makes it true?  Listen, why don't you give them the benefit of the doubt and get Alex back on the show?  We'll get him back on.  We had Alex...  What was the issue, Dan, that we were talking...  Does anybody remember?  We have to go through the audio again.  Because JFK...  Twinkie filling.  JFK...  No, there was something else, though.  Yeah, there was something more. 
[02:27:00]  That was recent.  Over the years, I said no.  He said yes.  They said...  Alex said somebody approached him about something, thinking that he wouldn't blab about it.  And again, I don't want to misquote the guy.  But, dude, when he wouldn't say who it was, this is a guy whose whole thing is uncovering  conspiracies.  And he refused to name who it was.  And you're saying, why is that important?  Come on.  You know why that's important.  But, Jimmy...  But, Jimmy...  I mean, there's so many other issues.  I mean, what...  Can you...  Dude, can you just admit to yourself and to me...  That issue.  Let's address the one issue. 
[02:27:30]  Can you not admit that that is somewhat suspect?  That a guy whose job it is to uncover things says somebody big or important came to him  and he won't name them.  Alex has death threats on him continuously.  You're not answering me.  Why would he want a death threat exalted on him?  Again, so you're saying that he wouldn't be trying to expose all these things if death  threats frightened him.  Right, right.  But his family...  So he only exposes enough that the death... 
[02:28:00]  The people don't pull the trigger?  What is this?  His family's been threatened also.  Why are you allowing your love of Alex...  Exactly.  Dude, why are you allowing the fact that you really like Alex to not allow you to answer  this one question?  I don't know why he wouldn't tell you.  Doesn't that disturb you on some...  Sometimes security purpose.  No, but his answer was, well, I just can't.  Dude, why don't you just admit that that's kind of inconsistent on some level?  I admit it.  Okay, sure.  But why don't you get Alex on and explain that. 
[02:28:30]  I would love to get Alex Jones back on the show.  We liked Alex.  I really did.  I didn't agree with him, but I liked him.  We liked him.  But, man, you're just doing yourself a disservice.  Dude, we treated Alex great when he was on the fucking radio show.  We got uncomfortable because he started falling apart on the phone.  And we questioned him, and he didn't really have answers for some important questions.  I was trying to pin him down on something, and I don't remember what it was, dude.  I know.  We got to find the audio.  And me and Jimmy looked at each other like, whoa.  But we treated him very well.  We didn't treat him like an asshole. 
[02:29:00]  But, again, we didn't agree with him, but we gave him a good interview, I think.  Yeah, I thought so.  He was very vague at times.  He didn't get into the details like you're asking for.  But, dude, he should be on that level.  All right, Dave, thank you.  We'll have him back on.  That'd be great.  Thank you, guys.  All right, Dave.  All right, and, Troy, so you liked the Jesse Ventura is what you're getting at.  I mean, the conspiracy show.  As far as the Area 51 goes, I mean, they showed all the pictures of the drawings of ideas that they've had.  That's stuff I've seen in books and populous science. 
[02:29:30]  No, I like that shit.  For over 30 years.  I dig on that shit.  Troy likes the dream.  I like the idea.  He's a dreamer.  As ridiculous as it sounds, I like the idea of them finding alien spacecrafts.  As ridiculous as it is, finding alien spacecrafts, taking them apart, and then our military.  Reverse engineer, as they were saying, yes.  So, you know, whether it's true or not, it's still a.  I think it's some very creative scientists being left to their own devices without being interfered with by politicians. 
[02:30:00]  And they're in there doing what they do, which is being brilliant, making amazing aircraft and weaponry, and being left the fuck alone.  It's great.  I love it.  I love Area 51.  Love it!  And back to Alex Jones real quick, if I can say something.  You know, he had this whole huge conspiracy on the oil spill in the Gulf.  And it was supposedly all this stuff going on, and they had to use a nuclear bomb to cauterize the hole. 
[02:30:30]  And then all of a sudden, nothing, everything was fine, and nobody called him out on this conspiracy.  And that's sort of some of the things I have a problem with Alex Jones with, is, you know, stuff like that will just slide under the radar and he'll just glaze over it.  Dude, he has five days a week of radio to fill, or whoever his radio, he's a lot, there's a lot to.  Like us, he's got to spew a lot of horse shit out to get to the end of his show.  I don't know how many days he does, but yeah, that's exactly it.  And Patrice has been on his show a couple times, too, I believe.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I would love to hear Patrice in with you guys and Alex.  I think that would be a good show. 
[02:31:00]  We'll get him back on.  I mean, he was definitely good radio.  By the way, you mentioned the oil spill.  Where is it?  BP had a hell of a quarter.  Yes, they did.  How do you have that billion dollar profits when you destroy the Gulf?  Because they've made unbelievable billions of dollars.  I don't know what the number is, but.  BP is one of the most profitable companies on the planet.  Even after destroying the Gulf.  They had to pay out billions in cleanup and reparations or whatever the fuck they want to call it.  And they actually have made a profit. 
[02:31:30]  That's how big they are.  They're giant.  They're giant.  I don't have the number I'm looking for.  Please, I hope the stock goes up.  I'm so happy.  What happened to Troy?  He left.  He quit.  He tapped out.  He tapped out.  I've had it.  I'm leaving.  I want to know if he banged Stevie's mom.  He's moving.  He's moving.  It's all mind control.  He's moving.  He didn't.  He's coming back.  Did you bang Stevie's mom?  Oh.  By the way, video doing very well on my YouTube channel.  Thanks to Troy.  Hopey Radio. 
[02:32:00]  That turned out funny.  Yeah, well, we did a little.  It turned out funny.  Well, we did a little posting with the video we did in studio.  It worked out pretty well.  But are you banging Stevie's mom?  No, no.  I haven't banged her.  It actually got kind of...  We don't want that to just be a radio bit.  We want you to bang Stevie's mom.  Right.  It got really uncomfortable after the show, by the way.  Why?  She wouldn't leave.  Yeah, she was hanging around here.  She wanted...  You know what she said?  She wanted some cock.  She wanted cock.  Sam, did you want cock?  I think so.  She was very smitten by Troy.  And...  Who isn't?  I go, will you do it for the show, Troy? 
[02:32:30]  Troy?  For the show?  That's a rough one?  Yeah, that's a rough one.  You've done worse, Troy.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I've absolutely done worse than that.  If you're dressing like that, you've been in some cougar bars.  I mean, you wouldn't do Stevie's mom for the show?  For the show?  Yeah, I'd have to do it for the show.  I wouldn't be proud of it.  It wouldn't be one of my finer moments, but...  This is not like every other radio show out there.  This is not a radio bit.  Are you going to attempt to do this for the show? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, sure.  Don't just say yes so it sounds like it's great radio.  We want you to really bang Stevie's mom.  She really made me feel uncomfortable after the show, though.  Yeah?  And she just wouldn't leave.  She kept coming up to me.  Oh, she was trying to get a connection going.  She wanted some cock.  Or at least something where it's like,  I don't want this to be just the end of it.  She came up to me and was like,  I just want you to know that I'm not usually that shy.  And now that I know you...  Whoa!  And she said,  Now that I know you,  I definitely won't be that shy.  Oh, phew, fuck Stevie's mom. 
[02:33:30]  She was yelling at Stevie.  She was like,  Stevie, you don't have to get all carried away like that in there.  We were just having a good time.  Don't worry about it.  It was fun.  And then I go up to her and I go,  Hey, you know,  I just wanted to make sure you were okay with all that stuff.  We were just, you know,  that's just how the guys are.  And she goes,  Oh my gosh, are you kidding?  It's so much better here than I thought it would be.  Ah!  Which obviously...  Steve has got to be the son cuckold.  Yeah, she liked you.  She was definitely hanging around a little bit.  He's got to prep Troy.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  How great would that be?  Oh, God.  She tells the poor bat it's an ice cream cone.  Go ahead, you blind zilch.  Bat!  Yeah, it was definitely weird.  She wouldn't leave.  And for some reason,  Stevie went running out crying  and she went running after him  and then she comes back alone.  It was just a whole weird thing.  He was crying?  Yeah, I don't know what was going on.  Oh, no.  Do you know, Sam?  What?  I don't know anything about Stevie crying.  I'm nice to see those fucking useless things  in the front of his face do something.  Yeah.  They spit salty water out.  Can we get Stevie on the phone?  I want to know why he ran out of here crying Friday. 
[02:34:30]  We could try,  but he generally doesn't pick his stupid phone up.  Well, we'll try after the break.  And I want Stevie's mom on the phone, too,  because I want to get a little update  after Friday's show,  which was pretty amazing.  All right, Troy.  Cool.  That's that.  Damn.  Where were we?  Randy Quaid?  And that's that.  Randy Quaid sounding real crazy on GMA.  Yeah, we didn't even know.  That's where we were going.  Wow.  Troy agrees with Randy Quaid, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  We have more audio of Randy Quaid on GMA 
[02:35:00]  after a little Carlin bit,  because it's, you know, it's Election Day.  Now, there's one thing you might have noticed  I don't complain about.  Politicians.  Everybody complains about politicians.  Everybody says they suck.  Well, where do people think these politicians come from?  They don't fall out of the sky.  They don't pass through a membrane from another reality.  They come from American parents  and American families, American homes,  American schools, American churches,  American businesses, and American universities. 
[02:35:30]  And they're elected by American citizens.  This is the best we can do, folks.  This is what we have to offer.  It's what our system produces.  Garbage in, garbage out.  If you have selfish, ignorant citizens,  if you have selfish, ignorant citizens,  you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders.  And term limits ain't going to be any good.  You're just going to wind up with a brand new bunch  of selfish, ignorant Americans.  So maybe, maybe, maybe it's not the politicians who suck. 
[02:36:00]  Maybe something else sucks around here.  Like the public.  Yeah, the public sucks.  There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody.  The public sucks.  Fuck hope.  Fuck hope.  Because if it's really just the fault of these politicians,  then where are all the other bright people of conscience?  Where are all the bright, honest, intelligent Americans  ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way?  We don't have people like that in this country. 
[02:36:30]  Everybody's at the mall,  scratching his ass, picking his nose,  taking his credit card out of his fanny pack  and buying a pair of sneakers with lights in them.  So I have solved this little political dilemma for myself  in a very simple way.  On election day, I stay home.  I don't vote.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  I don't vote.  Two reasons.  Two reasons I don't vote.  First of all, it's meaningless.  This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago. 
[02:37:00]  The shit they shuffle around every four years,  doesn't mean a fucking thing.  And secondly, I don't vote,  because I believe if you vote,  you have no right to complain.  People like to twist that around.  I know.  They say, well, if you don't vote,  you have no right to complain.  But where's the logic in that?  If you vote,  and you elect dishonest, incompetent people,  and they get into office and screw everything up,  well, you are responsible for what they have done.  You caused the problem. 
[02:37:30]  You voted them in.  You have no right to complain.  I, on the other hand,  who did not vote,  who did not vote,  who, in fact,  did not even leave the House on election day,  am in no way responsible for what these people have done  and have every right to complain as loud as I want  about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with.  So, I know that a little later on this year,  you're going to have another one of those  really swell presidential elections  that you like so much. 
[02:38:00]  You'll enjoy yourselves.  It'll be a lot of fun.  I'm sure as soon as the election is over,  your country will improve immediately.  As for me,  I'll be home on that day  doing essentially the same thing as you.  The only difference is,  when I get finished masturbating,  I'm going to have a little something to show for it, folks.  Thank you very much.  Where were we?  Randy Quaid on Good Morning America.  Sounded like a crazy person with his girl there.  The Quaids are now in Canada 
[02:38:30]  because they're living in fear.  They're seeking asylum.  Right.  Should be mental asylum.  Yeah.  Good one.  Good one, Chip.  The law caught up with them in Canada last week  when they were arrested and thrown in jail.  The Quaids say they came here  not to avoid the charges in California,  but rather to save their lives.  Who would be trying to kill us?  An estate planner  who had created a living trust  and a county  that could cash Randy's royalty stream forever. 
[02:39:00]  But why would they want to kill you?  So that they could take the money.  It's easier to take the money in that way.  Has anyone threatened to kill you?  They follow us.  They tail us.  They tag our cell phone.  They hack our computer.  Now, with the Internet,  I mean, a celebrity is fair game.  And it's all designed to sell advertising space.  Wow, he's out of his mind.  Is that drugs or psychosis? 
[02:39:30]  Who is the they?  Like, is there a singular they?  I wasn't even able to pick up on the they.  I don't know.  Wow.  They smoke a lot of pot.  It almost sounds like he's talking about, like, gossip blogs.  Really?  Yeah, like following him around  and trying to get dirt on him.  And the advertising space would be like  banner and ads and advertising on the websites, right?  That's kind of what I'm picking up from that now.  So if you kill them,  but then who gets the money?  He's talking about, like,  they get money.  Why are you trying to figure it out? 
[02:40:00]  He's crazy.  Oh, my God, because he's Randy Quaid.  He's trying to figure out a crazy person.  It is very possible that Heath Ledger could have been murdered.  Shut up.  Well.  What?  Is this Troy or is this Randy Quaid?  Who is this?  Imagine that he's speaking the truth  and we're just like,  oh, God, shut up.  But it's really a thing.  They're doing a Hollywood fucking hit squad.  And then you could get the royalties  for the rest of your lives. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, they want his royalties.  But, I mean,  wouldn't it be easy to follow the paper trail?  It's a hell of a scam.  Imagine if this could have possibly happened.  Yeah, you somehow get your hands on his royalty checks.  Or David Carradine.  And Robert Blake was set up.  Who are the star-whackers?  It's possible for people to gain control  of every facet of your life.  They're businessmen.  They're absolute businessmen.  And they slowly get stoned.  It's the mafia.  It's organized crime.  Are there any Hollywood celebrities out there 
[02:41:00]  who you feel should be very afraid right now?  Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah, definitely.  And Britney Spears.  Mel Gibson, too.  Don't you think his voice recordings,  his alleged voice recordings,  were pretty bad?  I think he was drugged.  It was his voice recordings.  I think he was slipped the mix.  Oh, my God.  He was drugged.  The fucking media is so annoying.  I believe this.  I totally believe the Quades.  Quades suck a fucking...  They suck a fat baby dick.  But the reporters even worse.  She stinks.  Even Jesse's like,  these two are full of shit. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  Unbelievable.  Never want Jesse to say that.  Not even close to the truth.  His voice recordings,  his alleged voice recordings,  were pretty bad.  I think he was drugged.  I think he was slipped the mickey.  That's my personal opinion.  Slipped the mickey?  I think she was sinning the doing the mickey.  To kill him or...  No, no.  No, just figuratively.  To ruin him.  Yes, to steal his money and ruin him.  Him and his wife just suck.  I'm going to slip him a mickey, Jerry.  I'm going to slip him a mickey.  They're awful.  Are either of you mentally unstable, 
[02:42:00]  schizophrenic, on drugs?  Do you think we are?  You tell me.  No.  Not even vaguely.  No, I don't do drugs.  We haven't done drugs.  He doesn't drink.  And can I ask you a question?  He doesn't do drugs.  Can I ask you a question?  Does murder happen?  Yes.  Does embezzlement happen?  Yes.  That's all I want.  That's all I want is somebody to investigate.  Are you faking any of this?  Absolutely not.  No.  No.  Why would we fake?  No.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, no.  They're just trying to find some safety and security. 
[02:42:30]  We're trying to live in this.  And we're being pursued by these people.  But we're not faking it.  We're confronting it.  They really are crazy.  I know.  It's great.  Like, who thought?  Love us.  And how do you get two people that are this crazy that are together?  That's how they meet.  They found each other.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's how it happens.  Yeah?  Yes.  How long have they been together?  A crazy person knows another crazy person.  Well, how long have they been together? 
[02:43:00]  I think I saw it from like 89.  See, that's a long time to be together and crazy, though.  Maybe Randy Quaid was always crazy.  We just never knew.  Because I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I didn't think he was that crazy.  Maybe he was always kind of eccentric.  Like, usually you'd get one person like, you know, fucking Jennifer Connelly in A Beautiful Mind  that kind of goes like, wow, you're fucking crazy.  Right.  Now, in this case, you got two.  But both of them are like, yeah.  I would love to be around their house on a weekend.  Oh, reality show.  Come on.  Maybe that's what they're going for.  Reality show.  Maybe they are. 
[02:43:30]  You can't believe this shit.  Probably even before that.  So they've been around with each other well over 20 years.  All right.  One more clip here.  That's batshit stuff.  I love it.  Have you stolen from hotels?  No.  No.  No.  But they claim financial advisors have stolen tens of millions of dollars from them.  And we've gone, you know, a day here, a day there without anything to eat, okay, or a place to stay.  And that happens more frequently and more frequently.  At some point, you know, you're going to end up out on the street. 
[02:44:00]  Quaid says his troubles have also jeopardized one of the most important relationships in his life.  Do you have a relationship with your brother Dennis?  I do, yeah.  Still?  Are you close?  It's been a little tense the last few years.  Oh, really?  But, you know, I love my brother very much.  And, you know, we have some differences.  But we are concerned about him.  Because I feel he's being victimized the same way that I've been by the same people and accountants. 
[02:44:30]  Have you warned Dennis about your concerns?  I've tried.  I've tried.  What does he say?  He doesn't respond.  Dennis is now on a treadmill of making movies that are garbage.  And it's unfortunate because he's talented.  Well, now we know why the brothers don't get along.  Oh, a treadmill.  You think the cunt wife has got something to do with it?  Wow.  Now we know why they don't get along.  A treadmill of making movies that are garbage.  Look in your husband's little fucking resume there.  Look at his IMDb. 
[02:45:00]  Why don't we look at Randy Quaid's IMDb?  Pick up the gems that are in fucking Randy Quaid's.  And compare it to his brothers.  Yeah, I mean, believe me, Dennis Quaid has made some clunkers.  But, I don't know, I kind of like that one where Frequency, that was kind of cool.  I kind of liked Frequency, yeah.  Frequency was kind of cool.  It was all right.  Bill with Mickey Rooney.  Dennis Quaid was an embarrassment over the weekend, though.  Yeah.  Did you see the clip of him as the situation for Halloween?  And he didn't look like the situation? 
[02:45:30]  Of course he didn't.  And instead of saying GTL, he said GTF.  He didn't even know what...  Why was he doing this?  For Halloween.  That was his thing.  But he had...  What was he on that he was, like...  If you can find the clip, it's better than the IMDb.  It might be on TMZ.  I don't know.  Like, wait, what was he...  He was coming out of some party as the situation for Halloween.  But he did not look like the situation.  Randy Quaid was in Pluto Nash.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  That's enough said. 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  That doesn't fare well for you.  It's not good.  He had a headband on, thinking that's what the situation would wear.  No, he wouldn't wear a headband.  Yeah.  And he had an open shirt, but it wasn't like the type of shirts the kids are wearing today.  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  Yeah, I don't...  Maybe we can find it really quickly.  No.  Yeah, TMZ's got it, of course.  Oh, God.  Jimmy, you like TMZ?  Um, not really.  I hate...  They were cracking them. 
[02:46:30]  Harvey Levin, though.  They were cracking themselves up yesterday.  They thought they were hilarious.  I hate him.  I just hate him.  I hate him.  He's a vulture.  He contributes nothing.  He's not funny.  He's not talented.  Does nothing.  There you go.  Same as President.  Well, that's how he dressed as the situation.  Oh, yeah.  It does it.  That's great.  The video's better, but whatever.  It's fine.  No worries.  So, Randy Quaid's nuts.  That's what we learned today.  Yeah.  Randy Quaid, completely fucking hysterical. 
[02:47:00]  Let's see where that story goes.  Man.  Celebrity's just...  I don't know.  Is it just the access we have to them?  That we get to see how really insane they are?  Like, no one knew Joan Crawford was crazy until that fucking movie came out.  Sure.  Mommy Dearest.  If TMZ was around, they would have had a lot of crazy footage.  Back then, like Clark Gable.  How nuts was he?  Was he nuts?  I don't know.  Oh.  We don't know.  How are we going to know?  Right.  I know, you know, some of the old celebrities like banging each other and shit like that. 
[02:47:30]  Rock Hudson was a mo.  We didn't know that until he fucking came on camera with the AIDS.  And said, wow, that's the AIDS.  And then people came forward and you go, what the fuck is that?  That's the gay.  That's the gay.  But earlier, people would have been like, oh my God, he's so gay.  The best go-to one ever was Liberace.  Liberace.  And the talk show host asking when he's going to settle down with a good woman.  Oh, God.  When Mike Douglas or one of them.  I know they did things differently back then, but with Liberace, really? 
[02:48:00]  You're going to play that game?  And they call him Lee.  Right.  So, Lee, when are you going to settle down?  It's like, come on.  You know, Lee, you've been on the road for so long.  Well, I just love being in Vegas and playing the piano.  It's just fabulous.  But, Lee, there's got to be so many women just clamoring for you.  I know.  Yes, it's just a, oh, Mike, what a chore it is for me.  I know they weren't vultures back then, but you didn't have to play it totally.  I know.  I mean, come on. 
[02:48:30]  Like, come on.  What are you, blind?  And Regis does the same thing now.  Yeah, he did it to who recently?  I think it was American Idol fucking fruit.  What?  Wasn't it him?  I don't know.  Clay Aiken?  No, it might have been Clay Aiken, but, no, the one that was on the more recent fruit.  Oh, Lambert?  Yeah, Adam Lambert.  Adam Lambert.  Look at him with the makeup and the eyes.  You know, that's, what's that called?  Metrosexual now.  He's getting the girls is what I'm talking about. 
[02:49:00]  Isn't he?  Yeah, there he is.  Here's a picture of you kissing another man.  Do the girls enjoy that?  He just doesn't, so out of touch with the whole thing.  He has no idea.  I saw him at my gym yesterday.  He is a miserable guy when he's not on TV.  Oh, Regis?  Oh, yeah, he's just miserable.  He's got to deal with Kelly doing the bad acting in those bank commercials.  I'm giving it my all.  You sound tired.  And she responds with a line that she read. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not even in the same room with her.  Have we played those commercials for everybody?  Oh, they're so good.  Her acting is bad.  Oh, Reg.  She just reads her part.  Does this bank, is it open?  Is it open after five, three o'clock?  What a bank is ours.  Regis, call the bank and not me.  I do not know.  Why are you acting like this?  You're horrible.  Her acting is horrendous in these spots.  Can we see one? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  I don't want to make fun of this.  It's so bad.  It's unbelievable.  Sorry.  Commerce Bank.  Yeah, let's listen to this.  Here we go.  I keep my buddy up my nose.  Regis doesn't like change.  Regis is getting nervous.  Okay, let's just relax.  We can work through this.  Are the faces the same?  Yeah.  Are you being treated any differently?  No.  You're still here for me.  Is anything being taken from you?  No, in fact, I'm getting even more.  I don't think this is one with the...  Let's try some breathing exercises.  Oh, for crying out loud.  What's not to like?  Let's get going. 
[02:50:30]  Commerce Bank and TD Bank North.  They don't care for TD Bank.  With legendary service and hassle-free...  That one's not that bad.  I just want her camel toe to walk in the room.  You're TD Bank.  That's not a bad one.  I have no idea.  I come in with my passbook, and no one stamps it anymore.  Jesus.  What?  Hi, welcome to TD Bank.  Right this way, you're going to get a heck of a teller.  Five foot four, strong man skills.  And she's a Pisces.  Hi, Mrs. Wilson.  Hi, Emily.  You two know each other already?  Yes, Regis. 
[02:51:00]  Legendary service is part of what makes TD Bank America's most convenient bank.  Oh, well, I'll bet she didn't know that Emily can make lollipop sculptures.  There's lifelike.  He's legendary, sir.  Why are you such a cunt to these commercials?  I'm just asking questions any doddering old fool would ask.  Do you think Regis notices that the lady working at the bank has a short athletic haircut?  Yeah, I don't think so.  A nocturnal creature.  Nocturnal?  If he's only awake at night, then when does he bank?  Oh, God. 
[02:51:30]  When does the owl bank?  Owls don't bank, you fucking Alzheimer motherfucker.  I have no idea.  How great it would be if the owl just climbed up on his face and shit in his mouth while  he was talking.  Plucked his eyes out.  I blinded, Kelly.  Yeah, like a Hitchcock film.  Yeah, you got to see these commercials over and over again.  Oh, I know.  It's so best.  It's horrendous.  She's terrible.  Speaking of Liberace, you know his museum's closing down in Vegas?  Lee, really?  What?  No one cares anymore? 
[02:52:00]  I watched that Sunday morning, so you get all these dumb stories.  Yeah.  Supposedly, the Liberace Museum was a massive hit in Vegas for so many years where it was  like millions of people a year or whatever it was.  And now it's like a spattering of people go to the museum, so they're actually closing  down the Liberace Museum and putting all this stuff in storage.  Is it true it was hard to find because you had to go in the back door?  Yeah, that's exactly right.  Yeah, that's what I figured.  Ass sex joke!  That's exactly right.  It's not true, though.  No, of course not.  They had a front door, too. 
[02:52:30]  Now we got this.  This is why I say I'm one of the hardest niggas in Madden.  I have one of the most best offense in Madden history.  Look at this shit.  Look at that nigga.  Greg Genius caught that shit.  He's probably the last player of the game.  But, though, earlier, though, the nigga broke his fucking leg.  How is he running with a broken leg?  Look at this nigga holding this shit, though.  Dog, he put the team on his back.  Dog, let's go inside the mind of a Greg Jennings. 
[02:53:00]  Dog, I got to do this shit.  I put the team on my fucking back, though.  My leg broke.  I don't know how the fuck I'm running right now, though.  I'll do this shit for Madden.  Oh, shit.  Darren Sharper.  One of the most hardest-hitting safeties in the league.  But I put the team on my back, dude.  Fuck it.  You can't stop me.  Cross the plane. 
[02:53:30]  Touchdown.  Greg Jamies.  49-20, man.  Fuck with me.  Fuck you, Gumby.  You know, I don't care how much he's trying to sound like the common man, this isn't going  to help the midterm elections.  It's...  You know, that N-word's very powerful.  We shouldn't say it, ever.  Well, we didn't.  Who was that?  We shouldn't say it.  It was one of the brothers.  That's right.  One of the homeboys was playing, what?  It was a little Madden?  A little Madden, actually. 
[02:54:00]  Playing a little Madden.  Yes, yes, yes.  He's going bullshit for that.  Yeah, he...  Oh, okay, so he was playing.  That's right.  Let's play the game.  But, though, earlier, though, the nigga broke his fucking leg.  Oh, I see.  How is he running with a broken leg?  Look at this nigga holding his shit, though.  He's holding his leg in the game.  He put the team on his back.  So, let's go inside the mind of a Greg Jennings.  How is he?  Dog, I got to do this shit.  I put a team on my fucking back, though.  He's holding his leg. 
[02:54:30]  I don't know how the fuck I'm running right now, though.  I'll do this shit for Madden.  All right, that's pretty funny when you see the video.  Oh, shit.  Darren Sharper.  One of the most hardest-hitting safeties in the league.  But I put the team on my back, dude.  Fuck it.  You can't stop me.  Cross the plane.  Touchdown.  Greg Jennings.  All right, with the video, it's really fucking funny. 
[02:55:00]  You should check out the video today.  He's doing a play-by-play of Madden game.  That's good.  He likes that N-word.  That's crazy.  N-person.  N-person.  That's right.  This should be crazy.  Crazy.  Yo.  What else is going on, man?  I was trying to think of something else I was fucking watching.  But there was one other thing that I was like,  I should probably yap about that on the show.  But, yeah, well, it's gone.  In the chasmos. 
[02:55:30]  In the chasmos.  He'll come back.  Yeah, I know.  Lee sued a paper that said he was gay and won.  Wow.  Who did?  Lee.  Liberace?  They used to call him Lee, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, please.  Of course.  Back then?  Wow.  Of course.  The paper can't fucking print that.  Now?  Please.  His ex-lover came out and said he was a gi.  Did he die of the AIDS?  He might have died of the AIDS. 
[02:56:00]  No one actually dies of the AIDS.  No.  They die of the complications.  Complications from the AIDS.  Right.  But that's the AIDS.  That's what I say.  It's from the AIDS.  Because when you got the AIDS, it's always,  the AIDS winds up giving you something.  That you can't get over.  No.  Now this.  You have 25 seconds on the clock, please.  Your clock will start after I read the first question.  Who's the Family Feud guy these days?  Now, I don't know. 
[02:56:30]  I haven't watched Family Feud in a long time.  What happened to, wasn't it the Seinfeld guy for a while?  Yeah.  It was the neighbor from Home Improvement for a while.  Oh, that goes way back.  And it was Richard Jennings.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this is like.  Richard hosted Family Feud?  It wasn't Richard Jennings.  Ray Combs.  Ray Combs.  Another guy that decided he didn't want to be around.  I think they replaced the Family Feud guy again.  With a black guy?  I think so.  Yeah, whatever version of the feud this is, it's a. 
[02:57:00]  I can't think of the guy's name now.  Louie Anderson, of course.  Yeah, of course Louie.  They've had a lot of hosts.  Richard Dawson?  Why can't I think of his name?  Yeah, it's Steve Harvey.  There you go.  Steve Harvey's the Family Feud guy?  Steve Harvey?  Harvey.  Harvey.  Do they flip his teeth over and have the answers on him?  See, because they're giant choppers that he has.  That fucking guy's books sold a shitload of copies.  Steve Harvey is massive. 
[02:57:30]  He's the host of Hot 97, I think.  He's a morning host.  He's very big.  Exactly.  Black audience.  Books.  Dude, he has a big.  You think Steve Harvey is funny?  How do you sell so many?  As a stand-up?  Yeah.  I do.  He was a very funny stand-up.  I haven't seen him in many years.  But yeah, I think he was a very good comic.  I think he got really religious, though, after a while.  I think he's religious now.  He's talking about God and shit.  We asked 100 men, name a part of your body that's bigger than it was when you were 16.  Your penis.  I think he's talking about God and shit. 
[02:58:00]  Not so good? 
[02:58:30]  It's like the medical terminology.  Don't get what you said.  It's that thing, lean, winking, any damn thing.  What the hell?  It ain't gonna sound right.  The medical term is almost worse. 
[02:59:00]  A slang term would at least be a ding-a-ling something.  The penis.  Oh.  You want to be keeping that answer?  See, the point being, everyone lost their minds for a very long time because someone  said penis on TV.  Penis.  He, he, he.  They all giggle.  The thing that really bothered me about that clip when I listened to it was, I mean, the  question is posed in such a way to, to make you think in that direction. 
[02:59:30]  Of course.  So, and then you're surprised that someone goes in that direction, right?  Yeah.  And like, there was like a solid 40 seconds of shock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, someone said penis on TV.  Was there some guffaw?  Oh, fuck.  How much guffaw?  There was some guffaws.  Well, you know, Steve Harvey was really good.  I heard some guffaws in there.  He was really playing it up, too.  Like, he just couldn't believe.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Someone could have used the word penis.  Louie Anderson's so mad he didn't get that question.  I would have had a funny line.  Show me penis!  Show me penis.  You'd love that one.  Can you play that clip again? 
[03:00:00]  I got a funny line for you.  Just a question, though.  I got a very good line.  Oh, cool.  That's what you do with that one.  You have 25 seconds on the clock, please.  Your clock will start after I read the first question.  We asked 100 men.  Name a part of your body that's bigger than it was when you were 16.  Earlobes! 
[03:00:30]  Oh, sorry.  Earlobes.  And it's 100 men?  Like, that wouldn't have been the number one answer.  Right.  Unless they said, without, you know, without saying your private part.  That's the first thing that comes to your mind.  Of course.  What would you say?  Your nose?  Your ears?  Your belly, I guess?  Stomach.  Stomach.  Earlobes would actually probably be a good answer. 
[03:01:00]  Your ears?  Anus?  Your asshole skin stretched.  Your breasts?  Yeah.  That would be funny if a guy said, your ass.  And he goes, what do you mean, ass?  Whoa!  And he goes, well, the cancer stretched out the skin that usually holds the shit in.  So now it just tumbles down the back of my leg.  Every time I sneeze, I fucking, I put a brown stripe on the back of my thighs.  Uh.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, fuck.  I can't believe that show's still on TV.  Exactly. 
[03:01:30]  It seems like people are enjoying it still, too, so.  Really?  Well, they're enjoying it, or it would be gone.  Fuck.  I don't know.  There are just some institutions out there.  That should go away.  I can't take all the fucking, I hate all the judge shows.  Those things suck ass.  Did you see?  And the doctor shows, the shrink shows that are on.  Go back to the, um, the, the judge shows.  Yeah.  Danny probably saw those, too.  But I, I, I wasn't sure if it was good or not to bring to the show.  The woman that hums.  What? 
[03:02:00]  Did you see that one, Danny?  What?  It went viral.  Like, uh, I guess they're going through a divorce.  It's the, it's a TV show.  Oh, it's a divorce court?  And, and, and, and, and whenever, whenever things get a little intense, the woman hums  because that's what her therapist said.  And I, and I'm not sure if it's funny.  I'm going to be honest.  But in a court of law?  Well, it's not even a real court.  Right.  Dummies.  If you can find the short version.  Tell the judge to go fuck herself.  She's retired.  Watch this.  Tell me if this is funny.  Mr. Harper, you've come here asking for $1,760, which you say is enough money to pay for 16 therapy sessions. 
[03:02:30]  My lying and stealing and everything that I was doing was as a direct result.  Now, Mrs. Hicks, you have a lovely voice, but I don't want to hear it now.  I wouldn't live with her. She wouldn't let me sit here. So I was going to Buffalo.  So you're saying you have a problem with your anger.  Yes, and I'm going to angle management class. That's right. That's what the humming is coming from.  Oh, that's what the humming is for. It's an exercise to calm you when you are excited in a state of agitation. 
[03:03:00]  Your honor. Your honor. Your honor. Your honor.  Oh, my God. It's funny, though. I'm just a killer.  So we're going to bring in the woman and the rain. Now, you see, you hum or whatever you need to do.  She's pretty funny. She's like, sing it. Look at this hoe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why are you talking while I'm talking? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, my Lord. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, hang on.  She just turns into fucking Aretha.  Now, I wasn't sure it was funny because it seems like it's kind of set up like they, you know what I mean?  But she looks ready to cry at one point.  Yeah, she really looks pissed.  She looks really upset.  How bad did you want to hum in court, Aunt?  Yeah.  You would have turned into Robert Plant.  Reaching some of those high notes. 
[03:04:00]  Is that funny?  Yeah, it's great.  It would have been funny if the judge would have shut her up with some American tourister.  Why?  Just because.  Why?  Because it's funny.  I don't know.  I don't know why.  Is that the reason today?  Yeah.  Because it's election day.  It's just always funny.  I don't know.  It seemed like she was kind of like, you know, doing that for the TV show or something.  Yeah, yeah.  She put it on a little bit.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Chris in Massapequa. 
[03:04:30]  Chris.  Gentlemen, good morning.  Hey.  I want to ask you, what's the deal with all these cake shows?  There are like six of them.  Ah, yeah.  Are they going crazy with the cake shows?  Yep.  I know you got the cake boss.  What else you got?  Wedding cake.  Oh, you got the midgets making little fucking, I don't know what they make.  What do they make?  It's a sure sign of the decline.  Or you just say what you want to say.  What?  Cupcakes.  What?  Ace of Cakes. 
[03:05:00]  I'll punch it out.  Good night.  What?  Cake Eaters.  I just want to know what the midgets are making.  What do they call their show?  Cupcakes.  Cupcakes.  Little cakes.  And it's...  Should have been aborted cakes?  They make cupcakes and they sell them like sheet cakes.  See, because they're small.  There are so many shows on now that are just other shows, like Pawn Stars from the Pawn Shop.  Then that kind of went into Pickers. 
[03:05:30]  And now they got the auction show.  Auction Kings.  Auction Kings.  Auction Kings.  And then they got a midget that fucking saves fucking pit bulls.  And then they got a midget that fucking does something else.  He's an investigator.  It's gotten retarded.  The exterminator guy.  The fucking hillbillies in the swamp guys.  Those guys seem pretty wild.  I can't watch these shows.  And not only is there Deadliest Catch, but there's also Lobster Men. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, Lobster Men now.  And Swords.  Swords.  Where they catch Swordfish.  Then there's the Trucker Show.  Hold on.  Lobsters aren't that hard to catch.  No.  They're not like in the fucking...  Yeah, the...  By Alaska.  The forced drama.  I tried watching Lobster Men because there was nothing else on.  I hate forced drama on reality shows.  It's the worst.  It's like, this can't be that bad.  They get to come home later.  Right.  It's no big deal.  There's no way they're hanging out in the Long Island Sound for a few hours.  I was thinking that a water skier might be looking at their traps.  Everybody has terrible Boston accents. 
[03:06:30]  I just couldn't watch it.  I still want to do like a little short on like Deli Wars where it's forced drama of...  So the guy came in and asked for a ham in Swiss and I gave him ham in American and wow,  did things just go crazy.  And then they cut those quick cuts to the guy like...  Dude, he asked for yellow American, man.  What are you doing?  Could I have the other sandwich bag?  Yeah, okay.  I didn't know what to do, quite frankly.  I'm sitting there watching.  I mean, Jeff knows how to make the sandwich and then they're yelling at each other and  they stand there across their arms for the promo, Jelly Wars. 
[03:07:00]  Like just inane, bad shows.  Why don't we do it?  We should.  We can find a Deli on Long Island.  Yeah.  We got cameras.  Let's do this.  Just bad, boring shows.  Let us have your Deli for an hour.  That's what they are now.  It's like, oh, who cares?  You watch them and it's almost like watching an infomercial.  You ever sit stuck watching an infomercial and you realize you watched the whole thing?  Yes.  Like, why did I do that?  That's what these shows are like.  It's like, why do I give a fuck if this place does well?  The D. Morton roast. 
[03:07:30]  I could sit through that fucking commercial.  Well, those, yeah, that's like an infomercial.  You realize an hour later, like, wow, this commercial never ended.  Because you get some entertainment out of it.  I like the ones that try to disguise themselves as talk shows and it's like Alan Thicke is sitting  at a desk and he's like, well, welcome to the show today.  And it's like, what a coincidence.  Your show is sponsored by the same person the guest is and all you're talking about is their  product and it's seen of this.  It's horrible.  Who's buying that?  You know, the radio interviews, you ever hear them?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Really bad. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, Clam Catchers.  Thank you, dog shit sniffer.  Oh, Clam Catchers.  Clam Catchers is going to be on TV soon.  Isn't that just called Pal Talk?  You see, you got Jersey Shore.  You see the second Jersey show yet?  No.  Jersey-licious?  No.  Takes place at the Gatsby Salon in Hoboken?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Hoboken?  You haven't lived until you've seen Jersey-licious.  Jersey-licious? 
[03:08:30]  Capitalizing on that whole Jersey Shore thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then Hoarders has another show called Hoarding Buried Alive, which isn't as good  as Hoarders.  Why?  That sounds like it should be better.  Nah.  If you're being buried alive on top of being Hoarders, that's kind of cool.  They get the B-list Hoarders, though.  Like, Hoarders gets the A-list Hoarders.  You go into places a fucking shit heap.  Hoarders Buried Alive is like, all right, I can still see some floor here.  Right.  Woman's cooking, for fuck's sake.  Right.  It's like a mansion. 
[03:09:00]  I want to see slobs.  Oh, yeah, this is coming to TV.  I forgot about this one.  John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi, John.  What's up?  What do you say about a bakery run by clan members, or you just call it sheet cakes?  Boo!  I didn't get it.  You can't just go away like that.  The hang-up is great.  Is he sad right now, you think? 
[03:09:30]  God damn.  I want to play this again.  The Ice Road Trucker, because we're talking about reality shows, whatever, had a great  laugh when he was in studio.  Yeah.  And Derek and Danny put this together.  On the Ice Roads of Alaska.  Oh, hey, man.  Thank you so much for picking me up.  There's someone that's playing a deadly game.  I got to tell you, man.  Most people wouldn't have stopped for a stranger.  The good Lord puts different things in one's path every day. 
[03:10:00]  What?  There's always things happening around me ever since I was young.  Not good things, you know.  This how I mean.  Hey, what are you doing?  Oh, I'm scared.  Well, I'm scared.  I'm scared of the dark, too.  But I go out there.  Prepare for the thrill ride of a lifetime.  40,000 Americans a year die on the highways of America.  The Trucker.  I'm the funniest guy I know. 
[03:10:30]  That's pretty fucking twisted.  That's really good.  Hey, let's not forget about the big guy, Jim Florentine, Roast.  Yes.  Going down tonight, 8 p.m.  Comics Comedy Club here in New York City.  Great cause, obviously, for all those kids.  God, I wish we had a number for people just to donate to the fund without going to the show tonight.  There is a...  Because we're talking to America right now.  Right, right.  There is a way.  I can get information about it tomorrow.  Yeah, all right.  We'll have it for you tomorrow.  But if you're in the area, it's a great show. 
[03:11:00]  Jim, are you performing tonight?  I am roasting Jim, yeah.  Roasting Jim with the rest of the gang?  I think Levy is.  Don, obviously, and Eddie from the show.  Voss is hosting it.  Bonnie's on.  It's a great lineup.  Otto and George, of course.  And I think I'm going on early, though, because I have to...  Bob Levy?  Get up.  We think so.  We're not sure.  Hopefully.  Okay.  Unless he...  He might be out of town, but I think he might be up there.  Okay.  But it's going to be a great show.  Yeah, it starts at 8 o'clock at Comics Comedy Club.  Yes.  That's 14th Street by 9th Avenue.  Let me say hi to Wallace. 
[03:11:30]  Wallace.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hey, man.  I wanted to say, stop, man.  The crows are on.  Oh, damn.  Wait, what was that?  I didn't say anything.  It's a great line, bro.  I heard you.  All right, fine.  Call me!  I didn't think it was going to work, buddy.  All right, very good. 
[03:12:00]  Very good.  Fuck.  Let me say hi to David in Washington.  David.  You know, hey, two points, boys.  First, don't forget Ma's Bar, which is a show about some old broad that runs like a biker  bar, and she basically just, you know, talks a bunch of shit.  Sounds like she's been smoking three and a half packs of home malls.  We get it.  Better reference.  Also, the sad thing about all this garbage television is that it's on what used to be 
[03:12:30]  educational channels.  Yeah, because no one watched them is what it was.  Now, everybody's actually, well, you did, but not everybody was watching it, and now  they're getting a lot more viewers with this shit fucking programming, because it is.  It's on Discovery.  It's on A&E.  It's on these channels that were initially educational.  I haven't gotten past the fact that you watch a show called Mom's Bar.  I don't even know what channel that's on.  I've never heard of it before. 
[03:13:00]  I've never watched it.  I've seen the fucking previews for it.  Oh, it's coming out soon.  That's what it is, too.  You don't have to even see the show.  The previews are all over.  Where was that?  What was that other one with the bar?  The fucking biker bar.  No.  Well, I'm punching up.  Good job, David.  The biker bar?  Oh, yeah.  It's on True TV.  It's called Ma's Roadhouse.  That's, yeah.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  No, it wasn't Coyote Ugly. 
[03:13:30]  It was the one with the fucking, the biker bar, and it's like, will they make enough money  to keep the bar open?  And who gave a shit?  Like, who cared?  I cared.  I guess nobody, because they don't even know.  It's the bar in Sturgis, yeah.  Right?  I don't know.  But it was one of those shows where it's like, you couldn't care, you had no feeling  for anybody.  Oh, the Full Throttle Saloon.  That was it.  The Full Throttle.  Will the throttles stay open? 
[03:14:00]  Will they make enough money?  It's like, I just don't fucking give a shit.  I have no tie to these people whatsoever.  And then there's the other one, Rehab, which was the one with the bar at the Hard Rock,  I guess.  And that was all phony.  There was always a fight, and the waitresses are always duking it out, and someone's getting  thrown in the pool, and just fake drama, and who cares?  And when reality shows first hit, they were great, because they were more based on reality 
[03:14:30]  than they are nowadays.  Now it's, what are they called?  What's the term they use?  Scripted reality?  Scripted reality.  Assisted reality.  Assisted reality.  Thank you, Gene.  Assisted reality.  Great.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, it just sucks now.  There's Jeff Dunham.  We had him on the show, and we had that book in studio.  That's so weird, when the guest that we had was on TV.  Oh, he's on Channel 5.  Hey, yeah.  Does he have the puppet with it?  Yes, he does.  Look at him.  He's got to sit there with the puppet now.  He's got to sit there with the puppet on that show. 
[03:15:00]  Hey, yeah, we've been saying this for years, and a little study came out.  Drug experts say alcohol worse than crack or heroin.  I've looked over this statistic, and it is...  Bullshit?  There is a...  It's conditional.  What do you mean?  Well, if you look at the amount of people that drink, and the dangers of drinking, which  include drinking and driving, falling asleep, setting things on fire, domestic violence, 
[03:15:30]  things like that, of course you're going to get more instances of violence, and death,  and crime, and things like that from alcohol, but it's because it's legal, and there's so  much of it out there, and more people are doing it.  It is like saying, more people die in car accidents than do in combine accidents, yet I would assure  you, a combine is much more dangerous to be around than a car. 
[03:16:00]  It's true, but you don't serve combines at family functions, and there's not combine...  Well, I'm just saying it's because it is accepted.  Alcohol is accepted.  It's legal.  You can buy it.  You can drink it.  I'm not even talking about underage drinking.  I'm talking about legal drinking is more dangerous than heroin, because the heroin addict, he'll  go over and knock over a couple of people to get money to get heroin, but you're not  hopping in a car and mowing down a family.  That's why the whole world is bullseye.  I think it's just skewed a bit, because there's so many people drinking, it's legal, and it's 
[03:16:30]  dangerous en masse.  If you do it per capita, I think it's not as...  I love how you break down statistics.  It's always very logical.  I love the statistics.  It also just shows how the whole world is complete bullshit, because we, as a society,  have accepted the death and destruction that alcohol causes in this country, but then  we'll yell and scream about language on TV. 
[03:17:00]  It's just...  Language on TV?  The whole thing is horseshit.  Or even things like aspartame, which everybody's bringing up now.  Oh my God, you drink some diet.  I think John Beck might be on our show talking about that very subject.  Oh, good.  You drink 30 friggin' diet Cokes a day, and the shit's gonna get to you.  Right.  Meanwhile, it's like, people really don't have much of a problem.  They got a problem with it, but not so much where...  I guess because they tried it already once.  They tried outlawing booze.  It don't fucking work.  Well, let's not outlaw language, then. 
[03:17:30]  Let's not lose that.  No, I don't think we should.  I don't think we should outlaw booze.  I kind of like it.  But you know what I'm saying?  As a society, we have accepted it.  Like, hey, we're gonna allow drinking, we're gonna advertise it all over the fucking place,  and we're gonna allow the fact that it causes a lot of problems in this country.  Yeah.  But then we will argue for hours if the word gay should be in a Ron Howard film.  It's ridiculous.  It really is kind of crazy.  Yes.  And then not legalizing pot is just silly.  That's gonna happen in our lifetime. 
[03:18:00]  I don't know.  There's so many people against it.  Yeah, people who are pro-booze.  There are people against it.  Like, I think Cuomo.  Didn't Cuomo come out and said...  Who fucking cares what that daddy's boy thinks?  Well, he's gonna be the governor of New York.  He said he's not for medical marijuana because he just sees more bad than good happening with it.  It's like, tell that to someone who's fucking on chemo.  That just wants to smoke a joint so they're not puking up blood.  But do you think more bad happens with alcohol than good?  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  So why does it Cuomo fucking tackle that?  What's the good that comes from alcohol?  You just feel good.  There's probably something else you could take that would make you feel good like that.  Some type of drug.  I'm sure they could make some kind of drug that makes you feel drunk but doesn't fuck you up like that.  Come up the ass, maybe?  Yeah, it's a good feeling.  Are you from the school that pot is way safer than alcohol?  Because I am.  Yeah, I think it is.  I absolutely am from that school at all.  I think in excess, anything's fucked up.  Of course.  I think if you smoke a fuckload of pot and get stoned and drive, you're probably not gonna be as good a driver as if you weren't smoking weed. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, but you're gonna hit something going 10 miles an hour.  That's the gag, but I think you could step on the fucking gas when you're stoned.  Yeah, I think so, too.  But I always liked that gag, but I think you're right.  I think people have to.  But you concentrate so much more.  Yeah, you're like, you're not texting so much, you're not fucking around.  But you're not sure if you're concentrating well.  You're very focused, though, when you're on pot.  But you think you are.  I think you are, though.  I don't know.  I think you're focused on the wrong shit.  Like, you'd be looking at your horn.  You'd be driving just concentrating on the horn, the steering wheel. 
[03:19:30]  Or your cigarette lighter, or something.  Just thinking about toast.  Yeah, yeah, and just fucking plowing into a guardrail.  But at least you're focused on one thing.  Yes.  Whether it be toast or driving.  I love that people would say they've never been in a fight when they were high.  People have been in fights when they were high.  People smoke.  Yeah, please.  But I think it is safer than alcohol.  Yeah, of course it is.  There's no violence associated with, like, there was a booze. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, booze gets people fucking really revved up.  Like, a lot of people can't drink without getting just fucking nasty.  Yeah.  And then hangovers are just, like, the worst thing.  You have a good day, you waste a day.  It's just a pain in the ass.  I mean, if you really want to get, you know, toasted and have some fun or something.  Did you waste a day over the weekend?  No, actually, I wasn't that bad Sunday.  I was up by noon or so on Sunday, yeah.  But I didn't go to sleep until, like, 4 or whatever it was.  But it was fun. 
[03:20:30]  You know, I had a good time.  But, yeah, unless there's some kind of reasonable substitute, because it's a social, it's accepted as a social thing.  Like, you go to a party, you go to a business party, a Christmas party, drinking is there.  Booze is there.  People have a glass in their hand.  They're talking with each other.  It's not like you could just walk around a party smoking a joint.  Certain parties you can.  Not the corporate, you know, environment. 
[03:21:00]  Something like that.  It's just something that's so accepted.  And then, oh, look, fucking Harry's fucked up again.  And they don't care.  He gets in the elevator, goes downstairs.  Where's he going?  Who cares?  Who knows?  Like, it's just an accepted body count that we have in this country.  That and cigarettes.  Cigarettes is another thing.  Yeah, we've just accepted that.  Yeah, that's going to cause all sorts of problems.  Cigarettes is an insane poison that you're just fucking putting in your body.  Well, let's keep focusing on language.  No problem.  It is completely dangerous.  It's out there.  People are doing it in front of their children. 
[03:21:30]  Meanwhile, they're upset when their children hear the word shit on TV or see a titty on TV.  But the parents themselves are showing them something that is so fucking dangerous to them.  But they'll never outlaw it because it's part of the U.S. economy.  You know what tobacco is to this country?  You know what fucking American cigarettes sell around the world?  It's astounding.  And that's why eventually pot will be legalized.  They'll figure out how to make some good cash on it.  People aren't hurting for pot. 
[03:22:00]  People aren't hurting for pot right now.  And if the government tries to step in and take over pot production, I mean, you're going to look at another kind of prohibition.  It's going to open up organized crime.  They're not going to want to pay for the tax.  They're going to want their own weed.  It's the same thing as prohibition.  Why would it be any different than booze when they outlawed booze?  It made the mob.  But I'm saying they'll figure it out eventually.  I don't know.  They'll figure it out.  They haven't figured out booze.  They can't figure out booze.  Well, they taxed the shit out of it and everything.  But, I mean, they... 
[03:22:30]  Syntax.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at all syntax on it.  Hey, are we legalizing marijuana in California today?  Is that possible?  I don't know.  I heard that fight's kind of taking a back seat to everything now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's not a lot of voice for it.  So it doesn't go down today?  I don't know.  Most likely.  I think there's a proposition up.  Yeah.  California loves their props.  Prop 19.  I think.  Got it?  Yeah.  They love their propositions.  They love props.  But, uh, the other thing is, yeah, Arnold's fucking done, man.  He's fucking...  After January, he's just gonna be back to, uh, being Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Making movies. 
[03:23:00]  The governator.  The governator, yeah.  Does he go back to making movies?  He's so much older now than he was when he went into office.  It's so weird.  Like, what was the last movie he made before he took office as the governator?  It's probably Terminator 3.  Was it?  I'll have to check.  It might have been.  How many years did he do as governor?  Eight.  It was eight.  Yeah, it was eight.  Eight fucking years.  Can you believe that?  Remember all the jokes when he was running?  Sure.  That was eight fucking years ago.  I made a good joke.  I was like, imagine if he gets elected, boy, we'll see what happens then, you know?  That's a good one. 
[03:23:30]  Holy fuck.  Cracked everybody up.  Probably the funniest one I've heard yet.  Let's, uh, take a look at what movie he made before he was governor here.  Okay, Anthony.  Mornings.  Ron and Fez.  Middays.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  What's up?  I did.  All right.  What?  The hottest is important. </pre>
