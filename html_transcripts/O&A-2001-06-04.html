<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a trade magazine featuring radio bit ideas.  The hosts attempted several, including "Drive-By Joking" (which ended with their intern, Spaz, being ejected from the Letterman studio), "Half-Minute Run" (a caller Q&A game that proved largely unsuccessful), and "Shut the Hell Up" (a game where a caller's friend or relative was to say "Shut the hell up!" – also unsuccessful).  The hosts recounted an awkward lunch with their bosses, including an awkward hug and comments from Ken Stevens.  The conversation drifted to listener nicknames for show stalkers, a caller’s awkward boss encounter, off-color jokes, a caller offering to sell his sperm, and numerous impersonations.  Multiple callers participated in the bits, contributing to the show’s overall vulgar and sexually suggestive tone.

The show then transitioned to a chaotic segment revolving around Limo Anthony and his limousine service.  A dispute arose regarding the legitimacy of his promotion on the show, quickly escalating to suggestions of increasingly violent “promotional” activities including paintball fights and using Limo Anthony as a human dartboard.  This led to Psycho Mark (a caller), along with in-studio guests Mitch from "Survivor," Stephen Lynch, Mike DiNicola, and others, contributing to the escalating absurdity.  The hosts ultimately agreed to throw darts at Limo Anthony's back (with "spine protection"), resulting in some bleeding and several plugs for his business.

Following the dart-throwing incident, a "fake orgasm" contest with female callers, Stephanie (who was topless and recently pierced), Wendy, and Irene, commenced.  Wendy won the $150 prize.  Listener calls followed, including one describing significant physical reactions to the audio and another recounting witnessing the contest from traffic.  A significant portion then featured a highly offensive and misogynistic Mike Tyson impression, filled with insults and sexually aggressive comments towards the Queen and Princess Diana.

The show further devolved into a listener call-in segment focusing on the naming and description of various sexual acts performed with one's genitals, using crude slang and humorous descriptions. Callers coined numerous terms, including “the squirrel on the trampoline,” “the bird bath,” “the elephant,” “the light at the end of the tunnel,” and “the walnut.”

The broadcast then addressed the failed "Feels for Meals" promotion.  This led to an attempt to coax Wendy (from the orgasm contest) and her brother Jeff into a scenario where Jeff would grope Wendy inside the box, for prizes including Brewer tickets and a meet-and-greet.  A blindfold for Wendy was suggested to increase the "interest." A listener called in to express disgust.

The final segment involved a game where a blindfolded Wendy had to identify her brother by touch among several men.  The incentive was backstage passes to see Jim Brewer.  The segment involved significant vulgar discussion and commentary from the hosts and others about the act, including descriptions of the men's touch and Wendy's breasts.  Wendy correctly identified her brother.  Post-game discussion included further crude jokes and commentary, interspersed with phone calls, including one expressing strong disapproval. The show concluded with more sexually suggestive banter and a break announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony love to mix it up on the phones with their fans.  Here, Opie gets a chance to talk to a really big fan on the Ron and Fez Show.  I really look up to you a lot because I want to do radio too.  And like you just like you've dedicated like your whole life to just be a radio DJ.  Like I just love you.  Amy?  Yeah?  Do you think I care about your life?  Uh-oh.  This call isn't going well.  Let's see if Opie can save it when the fan calls back. 
[00:00:30]  Do you feel fondness for Opie?  I like him a lot, I guess.  Amy, is it a situation where you can't wait for the Opie and Anthony's going to come on in New York?  Yeah.  Do you listen all the time?  Yeah.  So after school you run home and you make sure you catch our show every day?  Yeah.  Monday through Friday?  That's nice.  You don't miss many breaks, right?  No.  You might want to get a life, but...  Oh, that Opie.  He's a character.  Congratulations, though.  You've got to be the meanest man alive. 
[00:01:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show, right here on 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, so let's get to the trade magazine thing.  Yes.  Do you want to explain what we did yesterday and what we're going to do today?  Sort of like taking everyone behind the scenes.  Sure.  Like Rick did at Universal Studios.  What you're seeing here is a facade.  It's at the front of the building, but as we drive around back, look, it's just popped up in some 2x4s and other woods. 
[00:01:30]  You might recognize this from the movie Spartacus.  You remember that, Rick, right?  See?  Yeah.  So what we like to do is drive the old radio tour bus behind some of the facades of radio, Opie.  Yeah, we like to break down that wall and explain to you what happens with other radio shows around the country.  And yesterday we were learning all about contesting. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  To make our contesting better on our show.  They forgot the most important rule, though, in contesting.  We read it yesterday, and I didn't see this anywhere in there.  Have a prize.  Have a prize.  That's a good one that they should learn here at any W.  Any contest should have a prize.  All right, Anthony.  So I got my hands on a radio publication.  This goes to many, many morning shows around the country to make their morning show better. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  There's a few guys in this here city of ours that do these bits.  It's a, it's a, they, they share.  Yeah.  So these shows in the middle of nowhere, they do a good bit on their show, and then they type a little e-mail letter to this publication.  Guy's got a great response from this bit.  Right.  Try it out in your city.  So they send the e-mail into the publication, and the publication collects all the bits from all over the country.  Yeah.  And they reprint them as a feature called Best Bits of the Month, Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And if you subscribe to this magazine that I'm holding, you could do some of these bits at your radio station.  Right.  As they share to help each other out.  Are you ready for the Best Bits of the Month of September, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  We start off with Drive-By Joking.  Drive-By Joking.  You send your intern out with a joke book and have him insist on reading jokes to people waiting to cross the street or at the light. 
[00:03:30]  That's a Drive-By Joking.  Yes.  And that's one of the popular things.  So we would send someone out on the street.  And made the Best Bits of the Month?  Yes.  With a cell phone or something, I guess?  Mm-hmm.  And they insist on telling people jokes while they're waiting to cross the street.  Would you like to try this bit today?  If it's one of the Best Bits of the Month?  Sure.  Well, it would be silly not to jump all over this.  Let's see how it does in New York City.  Where's Spaz?  Let's see if Spaz is willing to do this. 
[00:04:00]  Spaz, are you willing to try out one of the Best Bits of the Month?  Yes, I am.  From this fine radio publication.  It's called Drive-By Joking.  Okay.  What do I have to do?  We're going to send you out on the streets with a joke book.  You've got to walk up to people and read jokes to people as they wait to cross the street or a light.  Okay.  Do we have a joke book?  Yes.  We do.  What kind?  Anything good?  A dirty joke book.  A dirty joke book?  A dirty joke book.  Okay.  All right.  Go get the dirty joke book. 
[00:04:30]  Hurry up and bring that back in here.  And we'll send you out to try one of the Best Bits of the Month, Spaz.  Yeah.  All right?  Very, very excited.  Also on this list, the Best Bits of the Month that you can try at your radio station, at your show.  Yeah.  The Half Minute Run.  The Half Minute Run.  What is this about?  Well, Anthony, it's pretty simple.  Mm-hmm.  You get two listeners on the phone, and they go back and forth answering a question with a question for 30 seconds.  Oh-ho!  They must ask a question back and forth for the full 30 seconds. 
[00:05:00]  First one to answer the question without asking another question back loses.  Oh!  And that's one of the, like, Bits of the Month.  Best Bits of the Month, Anthony.  All right.  You can put them in a situation, like at the mall, a ball game, or wherever.  Oh-ho!  Oh, we can put them in a little situation.  And here's the joke.  Great.  Here's the joke.  You're at a whorehouse.  Go.  Hey, get two people on the line that want to play Half Minute Run. 
[00:05:30]  But, Anthony, there's the joke book we're going to send.  All right.  We're going to send Spaz out on the streets with.  Get a sampling.  How did Yoko Ono get her name?  Oh.  When she was born, her father cried, oh, no, because he couldn't tell her face from her ass.  I'm just opening them up.  All right.  Why is Nancy Reagan like a dead camel?  Why?  They're both very dry humps.  That's so funny, I forgot to laugh.  What's the most practical gift for Imelda Marcos? 
[00:06:00]  What?  A shoe forest.  A shoe.  All right, Spaz.  What year did this come out?  Let me see.  I don't know.  Let me see.  Because some of these jokes are very, very dated.  Oh, 1988.  We have jokes.  Hey, look.  Dyson's material didn't get it.  All right.  What do you call a female clone?  What?  A clunt.  I said that.  Hey, we might not have to use that. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, use that one.  One good one.  A clunt.  All right.  We got a couple people that want to play the half-minute run, Anthony, as we try some  of the best bits.  All right.  These are the best bits by other shows all over the country.  But why don't you send, why don't you give Spaz the joke book so we can try that bit  out on the streets of New York?  I'm praying that you don't get punched in the face, Spaz.  Are you ready to play the half-minute run, Anthony, with a couple of our listeners?  Let's give it a try, Opie.  These are the bits that are supposed to make your show much better. 
[00:07:00]  So, well, we have nothing to lose, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's go to Mike on line three.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  You want to play the half-minute run?  That wacky game?  Yeah.  We really want you to try to play it, though.  I'll try.  Just make believe you're calling a really, really lame morning show, and you've really  got to try it to win the prize, okay?  Got you, buddy.  And we will give you something if you do win.  All right.  What about if I don't win?  Then you lose.  Do you know how to play the half-minute run? 
[00:07:30]  Break it down for me one quick time?  All right.  You're going to be a conference with another fine listener of this radio show.  Okay.  You're going to ask them a question.  All right.  They have to, in turn, ask you a question back.  Gotcha.  The first person that answers the question from the listener loses.  Right.  And you've got to last 30 seconds.  Ant and I will give you a quick example.  All right.  How are you doing?  How am I doing?  Is it going to rain today?  Have you seen the weather? 
[00:08:00]  Are you going to the Mets game today?  The New York Mets?  Or are you going to the Yankee game today?  Okay, I don't have Down syndrome.  I have Down syndrome.  How are you doing?  Ciao, Wolf.  Did I come around?  We've got to talk about that later.  This is pathetic, though.  This is one of the best bits of the month.  So let me get you with Pete here.  Hey, what's up?  Pete, do you understand the rules of the half-minute run?  Yes, I do.  All right.  All right.  Who starts this?  I guess we'll pick whoever it is. 
[00:08:30]  Should we put them in an interesting situation, Oakley?  Please do.  Yeah.  Let's make believe they're on a street corner in the middle of Manhattan.  All right.  You're on a street corner in the middle of New York City, everybody.  Mike, you're going to start out by asking Pete a question.  Remember, Pete?  I'll answer with a question.  All right.  You guys ready?  I'm ready.  All right.  Start the clock.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's synchronize.  In three, two, one. 
[00:09:00]  Pete, go.  Oh, we'll go first.  Me and Pete.  Pete.  That was a question.  I know, but Pete, go.  Hey, Mike.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  I'm over here now.  That's not a question.  You loser, Eddie.  You suck.  But, you know, this is a great, great...  Woo-hoo.  Oh, wacky.  All right.  Who lost?  Pete won.  Mike won.  Mike won? 
[00:09:30]  Woo-hoo.  All right, Mike, hold on the line.  We're going to give you a prize for playing.  You guys are the best.  Thank God you don't do this crap.  Thanks for playing half-minute rod.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Anthony, make sure we write down that we played the half-minute run today at 4.50.  Because then tomorrow we can play it at 6.50.  6.50, it'll be brand new for a brand new audience.  Right.  Because not everyone gets to listen to the whole goddamn radio show.  Right.  People are doing that.  Best bits of the month.  The half-minute run.  Well, that one didn't work too well, Anthony.  No, that really. 
[00:10:00]  Soft.  Do you want to play the shut-the-hell-up game?  Shut-the-hell-up guy.  Do you want to give the rules to the shut-the-hell-up game?  Best bits of the month of September, Anthony.  Let me see the shut-the-hell-up game.  Hey, have a contestant conference with a spouse or friend.  They can only repeat what the spouse or friend says.  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or friend to say,  Shut the hell up!  Try to find a guy that'll call him the game like that. 
[00:10:30]  Shut the hell up.  Called, you're an effing a-hole.  Shut the hell up, King.  And then there's, you stop calling me that game, which is similar, Opie.  Yeah, what's that?  But the contestant continuously calls their spouse or friend a predetermined name.  Example, Hoochie Mama.  Imagine that.  He's on the floor with his wife, and he just keeps saying,  Okay, Hoochie Mama.  What do you want me to bring home, Hoochie Mama? 
[00:11:00]  How's the kid, Hoochie Mama?  Wait a minute, 30 seconds to get their spouse or wife to say,  Stop calling me that!  Hoochie Mama.  Hey, can you tell me?  I'm going to play a game.  Shoot the DJ in the head.  If I'm playing a contest that really seems stupid,  Please, come on up, just shoot me in the head.  Holy smoke.  Best bitch of the month of September, though.  Hold on, this guy's calling his wife to play Shut the hell up.  Ah.  Tony.  I forgot how to play that one. 
[00:11:30]  It's very easy.  Explain the Shut the hell up game again, Anthony, to Tony.  The Shut the hell up game.  Have a contestant, which would be you, too.  A conference with a spouse or a friend.  They can only repeat what the spouse or friend says.  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or friend to say,  Shut the hell up!  Yeah, Shut the hell up!  Ho, ho, ho!  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I feel it.  You want to play, Tony?  Yeah, I'm ready. 
[00:12:00]  We're going to get that license up, or I know we're going to play Shut the hell up!  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  Tony, it's going to ring in a second here.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah.  Sean?  Yeah.  Hi.  Mom?  Hi.  What's the matter, you all right?  What's the matter, you all right?  Why are you imitating me?  Why are you imitating me?  Where are you?  Where are you?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Your son's looking for you.  Your son's looking for you?  Are you trying to be funny? 
[00:12:30]  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  Somebody has to make money in this family.  Somebody has to make money in this family.  Not you, obviously, that you're on the phone right now playing games.  Not you, obviously, you're on the phone somewhere playing games.  Supercalifragilisticexialidocious.  Supercalifragilisticexialidocious.  What are you doing right now?  What are you doing?  Where are you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, Tony. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Tony's wife on the phone.  What's your name, darling?  Joanne.  Joanne, we were playing a great, groovy new game called Shut the Hell Up.  You see, your husband, Tony, has 30 seconds to repeat everything you say until you say,  Oh, shut the hell up.  We're on the radio right now.  I wasn't paying attention.  What's your name, darling?  And I didn't say shut the hell up, and I always do.  What's your name, darling?  Joanne.  Joanne, I'm sorry.  You don't. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, Joanne, what's your favorite radio station?  Is this talk radio, my favorite radio station?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7-0-1-0-2-7-0-1-0-2-7-0-1-0.  Well, thanks for playing the Shut Up game.  I guess we don't have a winner this afternoon.  We'll be playing this game again tomorrow.  At what time?  I think we'll play it at 345 tomorrow.  No, we have Battle of the Sexes penciled it for that time. 
[00:14:00]  All right there, Tony and Joanne.  Lovely couple.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And don't forget, shut the hell up.  That came blown.  Who's going to say shut the hell up?  Come on, man.  That was good.  Someone might say knock it off or what are you doing or shut up.  But shut the hell up.  And then what if they just say shut up?  Do they win?  They don't specify in this.  Well, it's one of the best bits of the month, according to this radio magazine that I got in my hand. 
[00:14:30]  This is legit bits.  So, Spaz.  All right, Spaz is ready to play the other game, Anthony.  All right, Spaz is on the phone.  Spaz, you've got to be our intern for this.  Spaz is going to be playing.  Listen, I'm laughing so hard I can barely say it.  This is what we call the drive-by joking.  We send our own Spaz out on the streets with a joke book.  And he is going to insist on reading jokes to people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Waiting across the street.  Hey, Spaz, are you there?  Are you ready to play?  All right, Spaz.  Yes, I am.  I'm trying to select someone right now.  Spaz, just walk up to somebody and just start telling them a joke.  All this bit is bad job walk.  What do you call a female clone?  A clunt.  What's she doing, Spaz?  What's she doing?  She's ignoring me.  What do most people believe is the most sensible position for a female to start in? 
[00:15:30]  Clone.  Oh, Spaz, what's she doing now?  She's ignoring me still.  Ignore me.  I don't know about you, Anthony, but I may crap my pants.  I already did, Ovi.  You smell that in here?  I just crap myself.  I'm on the edge of my seat.  All right, I'm going to ask you to go up to someone else.  Let's keep going. 
[00:16:00]  Let's keep going.  I'm just telling a couple of jokes.  I'm trying to keep in the crowd here before they go in.  I'm just trying to get the crowd warmed up for Letterman.  Exactly.  You have to do that.  Thank you, dear.  I have jokes.  I can warm up the crowd up for you.  You don't even have to pay me.  He did a drive-by joke to the Letterman audience.  I mean, I yelled at.  And kicked out by the David Letterman people.  What do you call a teenage black kid who turns on a violent crack?  Dead. 
[00:16:30]  Don't make me do this, okay?  Don't do it, okay?  This is called Letterman.  I'm trying to warm up the crowd for you.  Fast.  I'm trying to make people laugh.  You keep telling jokes.  You keep telling jokes on the sidewalk.  It's allowed.  What does a bride family do for a daughter on the 13th birthday?  Throw a baby shower.  That's good.  God, that is just...  Hey, Fab, let's play a new game, okay?  Okay.  It's called Punch the Bitch in the Face. 
[00:17:00]  That's going to make next month  the best bits of the month.  Hey, Spaz.  Excuse me.  Who circumcises whales?  Horseskin divers.  Horseskin divers.  Hey, Spaz, are you still by the Letterman studio?  No, they actually kicked me away.  They had two people literally pushing me away.  You're allowed to tell jokes on the street, you know.  I understand that, but they won't even let me on the block. 
[00:17:30]  They push me across the street.  Drive by joking, you'll apply.  Let's try this one more time.  We got our Spaz on the streets.  Do you know that the high divorce rate is largely a function of arithmetic?  Most divorcees happen when wives put two and two together.  I don't, I don't.  Do you think that was funny?  I don't know.  He doesn't even speak English.  He doesn't speak English.  Oh, hey, hey, Spaz, steal his wallet.  How dangerous are the cocaine wars in Miami?  Well, this Christmas, Bob Hope is flying in to entertain the police. 
[00:18:00]  A Bob Hope joke.  He's been dead for 12 years.  From 1988 when he can still breathe.  Coming up, horrible scopes.  Yeah, we're going to do the horrible scopes right after this.  Fantastic bit.  Spaz, you want to try one more drive-by joke?  Come on, Spaz.  Why was the whore with E.D. so worn out?  All she ever did was just eat and run.  Oh, the whore eat and run, you get it? 
[00:18:30]  She's sucking a c***.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that.  But, yeah, yeah, she's doing that oral thing.  You're absolutely outrageous.  I got out of habit.  I curse.  All right, Spaz, any more drive-by joking?  When has NASA decided to name the new space shuttle?  The Titanic.  Oh, the Challenger joke.  That's very topical.  I think DICE is using that at the garden.  All right, Spaz, I think this was a great bit.  Spaz, catch it.  Get your wacky butt back up into the studio. 
[00:19:00]  What are you not?  He's got a ghost on the screen, I'll be.  How in slow line is that?  Did you hear about the movie starring in The Rampage and Senior Citizen?  It's called Gumbo, Tired Blood Part 2.  Gumbo.  Come on, come on, back up here, you wacky bastard.  We need coffee.  There he goes, our Spaz, everyone.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  He's our Spaz.  You can't have him.  Our old Spaz.  Boy, he'll do anything.  I'll be drunk by joking.  How insane is that?  Unbelievable.  I was hoping for some charro jokes myself.  Casey, what's going on in there?  Please stop the radio voice.  It's giving me douche chills.  What's the problem, Stacey?  Horrible.  How are you going up, Stacey?  Horrible. 
[00:20:00]  Stacey and the Sunshine Band on the phone.  Oh, Stacey and the Sunshine Band.  That's a good one, Opie.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Stacey.  You a twat?  Oh, did I just say twat?  You can't say twat on the radio, Anthony.  Leave that to the guys at WNW.  They can say anything over there.  We're owned by Disney. 
[00:20:30]  We've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNW.  1027 WNW is...  The Sport Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special Ron and Fez.  Fez has a secret admirer.  Fez, who would send you roast?  I have no idea, Ron. 
[00:21:00]  Let me look at them again.  Here, make sure you don't get a little prick.  Hey, if he keeps sending roses, he can do whatever he wants to me.  I meant the thorns.  You filthy, filthy, filthy...  Ed.  All on the neck.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027.  WNEW.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that ass night's day. 
[00:21:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  1027.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  If you have something, give us a call.  Joe.  What's going on?  What's going on, son?  What's up?  You're on the air, man.  Okay. 
[00:22:00]  I just want to thank you guys for making my birthday.  I have much more enjoy.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Number two, I'd like to tell you guys in here.  Ah, wow.  Joe, if you're listening, call back.  Your cell phone sucks.  I'd like to...  And we want to thank you for listening to this show.  We got some ratings today, and we're hearing...  Ah.  We're hearing good things.  Hearing good things.  Good things.  Good things.  That's nice.  Seems like the boss is very, very happy in the back office.  Well, they took us out to a lunch today, which always means a good thing. 
[00:22:30]  Good job.  Old Chappick went out.  I'm so bad when I go to lunch with them, too.  Like, we sit down, and I look at the watch, and I go, all right, it's like 1 o'clock.  If I'm out of here in a few minutes, I play Agent M tires instead of sitting here with the two bosses.  All right.  And then, like, we get the food, and I'm eating, and then I'm just looking like,  oh, he's not pulling out the card yet, and the check ain't here yet.  So I always wind up getting up and going, 
[00:23:00]  oof, got some business to tend to back at the station, some important stuff to do.  And then I just, I leave, and I'm back on.  All right.  I'll be the Vikings.  I'm against the Persians.  Right.  Yeah, we got to work on the show.  We got to go work on the show.  Very important show prep, boss.  Thank you for lunch.  Thank you very much.  Okay, I've got to build my walls now.  I need more archers.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Did you actually get a hug from Ken Stevens today?  Yeah, it was a little awkward. 
[00:23:30]  It was a little awkward.  And the word love was used.  Uh-oh.  I, no, he goes, I love you guys.  All right.  You just weren't around for the hug.  I wasn't there.  I don't know.  Let's just put it this way.  I went into the office to ask about this fine ratings thing that just came out.  Yes, yes.  And it's very sketchy.  They don't have the whole picture, but they hear things and they pass along to you.  Sure.  And next thing I know, I'm like, you know, kind of at that big round table he has in his office. 
[00:24:00]  In his office.  And God knows what goes on there.  Yeah, that's the office where Psycho Mark had a couple have anal sex.  Yeah.  You can't look at that couch without thinking about Psycho Mark and a couple that had anal sex on there.  What a way to get fired from a job.  God damn it.  That's great.  Yeah, first pumpkin picking with Jeremy and now hugs with Ken.  Come on, man.  No, come on.  I'm kidding.  Help me out.  Help me out a little bit.  Dude, if anyone doesn't understand that joke.  I'm trying to tell you how awkward it was. 
[00:24:30]  I understand.  And you can go and write for the abuse.  Let me get the story out there and then you can abuse me, Ben.  No more signs, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  See, I hope I'm helping you.  Whatever, Ben.  Whatever.  All right, listen, so I'm sitting at that round table looking at the couch where the  couple had anal sex, giggling to myself.  And then he's telling me about these ratings things.  He has just an overall picture, but he knows you and I did very well.  Right.  And then he got filled with emotion and then all of a sudden, like, he's behind me and 
[00:25:00]  he kind of gives me...  Oh, wait a minute.  Stop.  Stop.  Come on, Ed.  No, I'm trying to picture the scene.  I'm really not getting into it.  I was sitting in a chair, though.  Oh, okay.  You're in the chair.  Yeah.  It wasn't like he was behind me and I'm standing there.  I didn't know what that was.  Oh.  All right.  So you're in the chair.  This never works when you try to explain yourself.  That trick never works.  That trick never works.  Watch me pull a rabbit out of my head.  Don't know what to think.  I'm sure the listeners don't want to hear the rest of the story. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  I'm fine.  I was sitting there and I was, like, looking at whatever he had on this round table and  he was explaining what had been right.  Now, this is Rick.  Did you feel hot, man?  Yeah, Rick.  And did Ken grab your ass?  Oh, my God.  And look, he's still writing.  Rick loves this.  See, is what called?  Booney.  Oh, God damn it.  You know what?  Come on. 
[00:26:00]  It's very funny.  The people obviously understand the reality, but they love digging in.  I'm trying to tell you how awkward it was, and this is what I get.  I understand.  See, they have audio from the office.  Do you like having your background?  I know.  No.  He was overcome by emotion because...  I know.  Because when you and I do well, that means he keeps his job for three more months.  Absolutely.  Let's be honest here.  I understand.  You're not going to see the stage in the top 20. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, no.  No.  When the ratings become public knowledge.  No.  But if we do well, he continues to get to play and do his little radio.  He feels very good about our show.  So he's explaining how well we did.  Yeah.  And, uh, he was overcome by emotion.  I'm sitting there.  Overcome.  And all of a sudden, there was just this, like, awkward arm around my, like, my shoulder.  And he was, like, trying to hug me, I think.  Are you my pal, Danny?  How about a French cat? 
[00:27:00]  How about some sushi?  And then he was, like, just, like, golly gee, I love you guys.  Like, what are you saying?  Your boss says I love you.  Opie, we're having a ratings party this Saturday.  Are you doing anything this Saturday?  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Now, come on.  I think the audience is smart enough.  As I look to the left, where the instant feedback's been in.  Fag, fag, fag, fag. 
[00:27:30]  That cake was going in that office?  What?  Fag, Kenzie?  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  This old gag.  Haven't heard this one before.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  All right.  So he was very happy.  How many times?  Get back up at my desk.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  What the hell's wrong with you guys?  Taylor, what's going on?  Hey, I had a similar experience this week myself. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah?  I'm a trader at a security firm.  Yeah.  And I had a really big day.  And at the end of the day, my boss came over and he's like, you know, sad you do today.  And I told him my numbers.  And he pinched me on the cheek.  Not once, but twice.  And I swear to God, I sat there and he gave me almost like a grandmother.  Yeah.  With this big smile on his face.  He gives me this kind of a pinch on my cheek.  Oh.  And I had a last step there.  I didn't know what to do.  The awkward moment. 
[00:28:30]  I had a nightmare the next night.  I woke up out of a sad sleep.  I'm like, holy sh**.  Oh, dude.  Wait, wait.  You can't say holy ass.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, but all of a sudden I woke up in the middle of the night and I'm like, I mean, he's married and everything.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  But it was kind of disturbing.  Yeah, Ken's married.  He's got, I think he's got a kid too.  But I know, Opie, I know exactly what you're talking about.  You're like sitting there going like, okay, well, what do I do now?  Yeah.  Do I pinch him back? 
[00:29:00]  Let me go on record and say that it wasn't officially a hug.  It was just this awkward arm thing.  Ken, you don't know what to do.  Like he was so happy that Ant and I, you know, saved the station again.  The Savior of the Station Awards.  As soon as this show starts sucking, this station will be standards.  Yeah, you're going to hear standards on WNEW if this show sucks.  It'll go, oh, yeah.  It'll go back to classical.  Oh, man, Ben is the comedy. 
[00:29:30]  What the hell's wrong with you?  Oh, Ben.  Come on, Opie, you know, if you were outside the situation looking in, that's a pretty funny line.  He writes, now two couples have had anal intense coffee.  You're such a dick.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call, 212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:30:00]  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't think to.  Oh, jeez, stop.  O-7-W-N-E-W.  212-757-1027.  Hang out with Jay Moore.  He's hosting Regents and Kelly tomorrow.  Guest hosting.  Regents is on vacation.  On vacation.  We'll all be checking that out tomorrow morning.  And I'm leaving my show in the trustworthy hands of Jay Moore.  I am easy. 
[00:30:30]  You can be good.  Where I am, you can be good at.  I love it.  Call Caroline's for ticket info.  I don't know what's going on with the tickets for the Jay Moore show.  Much like my old shows with Kathy Lee at Westbury Music Fair.  In the round.  I think songs that would sell out with the roots for the Midwest.  Did I do a show at Westbury Music Fair?  Yeah.  How'd it go?  It was there last weekend.  Did it go good or not?  It was great, Jay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not being serious.  I'm just saying it was great. 
[00:31:00]  It was packed.  And there was a fight.  Have you ever done comedy in the round?  It's a little strange.  No, it's so cool to see that.  I couldn't keep my fat ass away from other people.  It's in the round, you see?  You know, I'm talking to people over here now.  Yeah.  And my ass is over here.  Jay, what are you saying?  I got a big ass?  No, there was a funny moment because he was trying to do a callback from, you know, something  he did earlier in his act.  But he didn't know where the person was. 
[00:31:30]  He was trying to point to the guy.  He was supposed to point.  Like, if you're on stage, you know the guy's stage left.  If he's in the second row, you go, like this guy over here.  Right.  He wanted to go back to it.  You know, something he did like 20 minutes ago.  A guy with beige pants.  So he's looking for the guy and he didn't know where he was.  Like this guy.  Where the hell is he?  He's doing circles.  Hilarious.  Stage spins?  It wasn't spinning that night.  No, it wasn't spinning.  But, you know, because it's in the round, he's moving around like, you know.  He only spins when REO Speedwagon spins. 
[00:32:00]  I was going to say, what did he say?  Tiny Dancer?  Right.  I saw Yes in the round once.  Really?  Like a rock.  Did you do Acid?  I think it was shrooms that night.  And the stage just slowly rotates.  He comes out.  Maybe he wasn't rotating.  They told us he rotated.  He comes out like a diced superhero, the action figure.  He's got like these pants now that he wears.  Ridiculous.  You know, he's got these big, huge pants.  But they're not like ghetto huge.  They're not baggy. 
[00:32:30]  They just, the legs go straight down like two big tree trunks.  Like David Byrne in Stop Making Sense?  Yeah, but only their jeans.  They're like denim.  And they're huge.  It's the carpenter cut.  I like it.  Go to the gap.  It's the carpenter cut.  There's a boot cut.  And then he's got the good leather jacket with the studs all over it.  And he's like, look, I'm a transformer.  I turn into a rocket ship.  It's unbelievable, this guy. 
[00:33:00]  And then we get in a fight.  They get in a fight.  I had left beforehand.  I had previous engagement.  You got in a fight?  Rick and his wife and everything with this mullet-headed, Joe Dirt-looking chick that was sitting two rows in front.  I did not expect the word chick to follow that mullet-headed, Joe Dirt-looking.  Oh, she was a chick.  And she had this blonde.  She was so obnoxious and so drunk.  Yeah, all drunk.  She's trying to take pictures.  And then she's just like, hang, hang.  And somebody told her to sit down and shut up.  And then she wouldn't shut up.  And these guys told her to be quiet.  And then she spit on Rick and Rick's wife. 
[00:33:30]  I would have barked her in the mouth.  And Rick tried to.  Security came over.  And then they're like holding her back.  So Rick just goes right up to her face and goes, yeah, you F and C.  Like right there.  And then she goes, take a swing at her.  And security threw her like, hey, it was.  It sounds like a great brawl.  It was a very fun time.  I'm sorry I missed it.  It was hilarious.  Drudge Jr. is on the phone, Anthony.  I don't understand that type of people coming to a side show.  Drudge.  Hey. 
[00:34:00]  Drudge Jr.  I just got out some information on Christopher Walken.  Oh, you have info on Christopher Walken.  I'd love to hear it.  Well, a year ago he was in some sort of musical called Waking the Dead or something like that.  Where he was singing a really long song called Snow Fog Through the Universe or something.  It's been a lot of masters, the funniest thing you'll ever hear.  Jay, just to fill you in, this guy wants to be just like his hero, Drudge.  No, he's on the last time I was on, he called us. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, okay.  So this is like Drudge Jr.  He wears a hat and everything.  This isn't breaking news or anything, is it?  Well, I guess not.  I'm sure some people saw it.  I thought you had a scoop for us there.  This kid means Paxil or something.  Every time you're on the phone, you tell her you're about to jump out a window.  Paxil.  Paxil.  No, it's not really breaking news after all.  It just sounds like Eeyore.  Hey, Judge, what are you working on?  Oh, no.  Well, um...  Don't I get in the coffin, kid?  What are you working on? 
[00:35:00]  What are you working on, Judge?  Well, the Pat Cooper thing.  Oh.  Fascinating, sir.  Can't say it on the radio, but...  Pat Cooper, hot seller.  Pat Cooper, huh?  Okay.  I was also thinking about maybe running for mayor.  You've got to be certain that you're out of the loop in there.  I think there's a pubic hair limit, sir.  You know, I can't win, but I just think it'd be funny if I ran for mayor and I got a lot of votes.  Can't run with less than eight pubes.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin. 
[00:35:30]  There's no auto-enjoy.  He's so small, he pees on his nuts.  Oh, that's a good line.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, Judge Jr.  Are you doing the impressions here?  Is it Anthony or Jay Moore?  Ah.  Neither.  Otto and George are here.  And Christopher Walken.  I mean, the studio's still.  Hey, don't forget Joe Pesci comes in here like a freaking broad girl standing here waiting for everybody to talk to me.  I mean, in the lobby, some girl's like, wow, what the hell are you going to wow, you stupid sea sucker? 
[00:36:00]  You know, I'm standing here like a broad girl, like a colored guy in the street corner, and you're standing there with your judge's house over here, you know?  I really got him going, you stuntman prick, yeah.  Bring him.  Judge, when you crawl for the report, Drudge, what's his name?  Junior, Drudge Jr.  Drudge?  Drudge.  Yes.  In this day and age.  When are you going to go put your head in a rub in your balloon head, Jesus?  I really like Go, Jay.  Great piece of work.  That was good.  That was good.  It was horrible.  Are you being sarcastic? 
[00:36:30]  Hey, look, I'd be willing to point out some horrible Jay Moore movies, but that was, Go was,  it was a great movie.  Except for the lap dancing scene.  Why?  Because it's too sexy and with girls and vaginas in it?  No, not any scenes you were on.  No, why was the lap dancing scene not good?  They said that was good.  Well, you said except for the lap dancing.  The whole movie sucked except for the lap dancing scene.  Oh, geez.  That's what I'm talking around about.  He was trying to do there.  The stripper in that scene was four months or five months pregnant. 
[00:37:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Talk about needing some money for the pipe.  That's hot.  All right, Judge.  Sorry, I wasn't funny.  No?  Wow, that was a million of them.  Sorry, I wasn't funny.  Judge, that's on your job on our show.  Your job is to get, you know, the scoops.  Tell us what you're working on.  I thought that was a scoops.  You just download that song.  It's really funny to hear him sing.  All right.  Thank you.  Go ask Christopher Robin for some Lidl in.  All right, Judge. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  There he goes.  The kid's just calling from the oven.  He's actually inside the oven on a little pan.  You're like the drugs, Jr.  He's what, 13, 14?  Yeah.  I'm going to go kill myself.  I'm going to go start my mom's car in the garage with the door down.  He's going to get a little older and look back and go,  I'm excited.  Cool.  We all do.  Don't take a personally, Judge, Jr.  Looking at the computer with the people on hold.  Yeah.  And I can save us some time and energy.  Rob, yes, I'm going to play Rutgers.  I just read the screen. 
[00:38:00]  When are you playing Rutgers?  Look, he just went away now.  When are you playing Rutgers?  I'm not sure.  26.  Black guy knows every day the payday comes.  Need my money.  Yeah, 26.  You can't.  You can't.  You come to that karate.  All right.  I got that white woman I got to pay for.  Tell me.  That's good.  Say more about that.  He's still married to a white woman and his baby looks like Johnny Morton of the Detroit Lions. 
[00:38:30]  How is that, man?  He's still married to a white woman.  Yeah, she's blonde.  She's like children of the corn.  Blonde, blonde, blonde.  Yeah.  She's an albino, sir.  My son's got blue eyes with brown skin.  He's going to be a good looking kid.  Cool.  You pump out supermodels like that.  I swear to God.  Yeah, you are.  It's looking like this.  Supermodels are born, right?  Yeah.  Girls out there, if you want some of this good sperm, let me know.  Yo, wait a minute.  I'm the one who got the sperm on sale.  You got filthy Puerto Rican sperm.  Old Tide Daisy. 
[00:39:00]  No, Old Dirty is really selling his sperm.  Yeah, he's selling it.  I'm going to fill the earth with my feet, kid.  What?  Oh, my God.  I need to go to the adoption industry and pick up your Puerto Rican.  Here's your kid.  He had his crib lowered, and he's got dice hanging from his mouth.  They're just saving it up for when they could sell kids in vending machines.  That's why pump them out.  What's wrong, Old Dirty?  I don't see what Rick is writing.  What's your sperm per cc when you got it done?  Well, I was shooting. 
[00:39:30]  I faked out loads, kid.  I don't know what cc is.  No, but you got to know how many active little guys you got.  Oh, like the count?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  My cc is on jet skiing, son.  That's true.  Come on.  Yeah, he's Puerto Rican.  Come on.  He's dropping them off at the doorknob.  They're zigging and zagging.  Crazy.  They're Puerto Rican, man.  He's strong swimming, dog.  Maybe he can help out Jay.  Jay didn't have a good count.  Oh, why?  Yeah, he's a little rougher, Jay.  Maybe you got to eat some rice and beans, dog. 
[00:40:00]  Rice and beans.  That's a trick.  That's fried bananas.  There you go.  Jay went for the sperm count.  Word.  Yeah.  But, like, what's that, though?  Like, they count how many thousands are going to make it into the final running?  How many millions?  How many are swimming and how mobile they are?  Yeah, how well they swim.  If they got two heads or 16 tails, it's one of them going to swim.  Come on, man.  The nurse told me my whole posse was on jet skiing.  That's a good thing, man, right?  What did you go to the clinic? 
[00:40:30]  She really said that?  Yeah, you know, I'm good, honey.  Baby, no bones or no jet skiing right on.  Dino mine.  Don't your hands, Lord.  Damn, damn, damn, damn.  She told me that they were spiked.  It was a whole match.  I didn't get the number, though, man.  They were just mad crazy, right?  Yeah, sure.  Just kill magic.  Jay's are on a raft.  My kids look like a castaway. 
[00:41:00]  Jay came up with a little bouquet.  They sperm floating around on a raft trying to find the egg.  I'm holding martinis.  Pumping in each other.  Punching some sperm.  Come on, sperm.  Smarten up.  There's hot kids running around this place.  Like, get it together.  Got sniffers in their hands.  Oh, bo-bo-bo-bo.  Come on.  Kelly Ripley, get it together.  Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  I heard OD's selling his sperm.  I want to get some.  My female monkey wants to have a baby.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:41:30]  Sorry, OD.  Later, guys.  Dominicant.  Right.  I know who that was.  He's a Dominican.  I know who that was.  Yeah, who was that?  Petey.  Petey.  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm doing good.  Everyone's doing good.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, is this guy this old dirty?  Is he a Moulinyan or is he a Rican?  What is he, Zach?  I ain't no Moulinyan.  I'm the cat you come to buy your cocaine from.  Look, now, look.  I ain't buying no cocaine.  A lot of the things that you're not a Moulinyan, why are you using all this, you know, mad crazy  and mad rife and all this BS?  But he's from the neighborhood, he's in. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, that's right, man.  But if he's a Rican, he's not going to talk like that.  He's going to, like, you know, use the Rican terminology.  What is the Rican terminology?  The Borg terminology.  And what is it?  What?  You're so adept at knowing what language I'm speaking and you know what it is then, punk.  I'm not privy to that militaristic information.  Why'd you, like, you know, malign the English language a little more here?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Come and get your Coke at six, man.  Look, you're Dominican.  Is that the story you're trying to pass or you're Dominican?  You're Dominican, right?  You're Dominican, local.  Get the pasta, local.  Get the Pasta, local.  You're like Washington Heights or what here? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, that's right, Washington Heights, my brother.  What nationality are you, sir?  What nationality are you, sir?  What nationality?  I'm English.  I'm English.  You know, you came in Italian and then you faded into black and then...  What made you think I'm Italian?  Oh, you said, how you doing?  How you doing?  What?  You mean that?  Because I said, how you doing?  You assume I'm Italian?  Is that it?  Why are you talking like you're from Brooklyn, dude?  I'm not from Brooklyn.  I'm not from Brooklyn.  What are you talking about?  You forgot to change your voice before you got excited?  Hey, Petey.  Petey, what are you about, man?  What?  What are you about?  I'm not about anything.  I was just curious whether ODB was... 
[00:43:00]  Die, get in the coffin.  You touch children.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Who needs that?  I ain't never going to England.  Andrew.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, ODB is like the Puerto Rican Ralph Cranston.  He always has a get-rich-quick scheme.  I'm selling my sperm.  Alex.  No, get your foot out of the handcuffs.  Get your foot out of me.  Alex, we are going to be rich.  Easy street's coming.  I'm selling my sperm.  Get Mrs. Manacotti down here to give me a handy.  Alex, where are the pots? 
[00:43:30]  I'm selling my sperm.  Where are the pots?  Start whacking, Norton.  Alex, where's the sugar?  It's all nice and better with sugar on it.  Where's the sugar, Alex?  I'll throw a batch and take you all to Hong Kong Garden.  Bravo.  Oh, man.  You've got to like the honeymooners.  Come on.  I'm going to take them down to Mr. Marshall. 
[00:44:00]  George Louise, buddy.  I'm Marshall.  I'm Marshall.  Barbara Sam, how would you like to buy the finest sperm you could purchase?  Don't answer yet, Barbara Sam.  Because I'm also going to give you the pot.  Barbara Sam, you want my sperm?  It's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Rachel, I'm giving sperm in my beloved. 
[00:44:30]  No more Marble.  I've got to get Carrington.  Did you take any sperm from Carlos?  Or were you just Marble then?  Who's sperm is in this club?  Carlos.  Ah, cocktail time, huh?  Come on out, Hobbs.  Harvey.  When he walks in and they just left.  You remember Harvey?  Yeah, they just left. 
[00:45:00]  He's babysitting in the judge.  She's made just left and they're having a martini.  So he comes in.  There's two martini guys.  It's just a table.  The first thing he does.  Ah, ah, ah, oh, cocktail time, huh?  Ah, ooh, ah.  Where is he?  I'll tell you, little man.  You never give up?  You ever been with a bus driver, Hobbs?  Oh, jeez.  That's great.

Crandon.  It's got to work, Alex.  I'm dropping them off at the dogs.  I sound like Regis.  Of course you're joking. 
[00:46:30]  That's great.  Oh, God damn.  Ah, Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Yo, can you call a sperm-cora apple?  Can you call a apple?  Job for the future.  Job for the future.  You guys shut up, man.  Take it easy.  All right.  I love honeymooner references.  All right, we're going to take a break.  I've got a really good instant feedback here from Vinny from Rosedale, who helps us to show 
[00:47:00]  every day.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your saucers.  Why are you looking at me?  Because you look right at me all the time.  You don't want me to come in here anymore.  I won't come in here.  Oh, man, he's freaking out.  We didn't invite you.  Oh, leave him alone.  He's a celebrity.  He's hanging out with the Sopranos cast tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  You went to Rock and Roll Cafe, wherever you are, on Monday. 
[00:47:30]  Let's back up.  You said we didn't even invite you.  You just showed up.  You act like we invited you and then we're...  No, you didn't invite me.  Rick needed cars, so I came by.  Is that okay with you?  One more plug, right?  That's all I need.  1-800-GO-Vinyl?  Yeah, 1-800-GO-Vinyl.  Oh, now you owe it to another car, because that's four plugs.  He acts like we invited him, and then we're treating him like crap.  No, you just showed up.  And then you're surprised when I used to be. 
[00:48:00]  Anyway, Anthony, Vinny from Rosedale.  Yes.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your stalkers, and he lists all the stalkers.  Mm-hmm.  Stalker Patty, Lady Di, Marion, and Limo Anthony.  Vinny, you have made the stalker category.  Come to the road show tomorrow night.  Come say hello to me.  The new nickname for our stalkers, Anthony.  Ready for this one?  Yeah.  How about the retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley?  That could work. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God.  The disgusting, retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley.  I'm in.  Angels, I have a mission for you.  Discuss Opie and Anthony at all costs, all the time, forever, forever, ever.  Anthony.  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  That Anthony from Vital, he don't need you guys no more.  You know, he's a big shot.  He's going on other shows on WNEW, plugging his show.  What other show you go on?  The sports guys called me the other morning. 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  That's okay.  They called me, brother.  They called me.  Yeah.  I didn't call them.  But now, you know, now you don't need them anymore.  That's not true.  You know, you're just a tough guy.  You're going to get loud with them.  That's all right.  Opie's letting you, you know, you're giving me enough room to hang yourself.  What's your name?  Doesn't matter if you want my name.  You can come see me at the road show tomorrow night, too.  Oh, my God.  Come see me.  Do you want to beat people up?  Because we'll make it happen on the stage.  We'll have a punching booth.  All right.  You can just come in and punch you.  You don't have a bad ankle.  I'll try my best.  No.  Do you want people just to come on stage and beat you up? 
[00:49:30]  No.  You know what?  I won't come there by myself.  I'll come there with, like, 40 people I know.  We'll all pummel you together.  There you go.  We need, like, can we, like, I don't know.  We need to do something with him.  I tell you, hang out over here.  Can we shoot, like, paintballs at you on stage?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, you can shoot paintballs at me.  I need a paintball company.  Well, wait a minute.  Well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  But am I protected at all?  Like, you guys, wait.  You get goggles and a cup.  That's it.  You're so cocky.  We're going to shoot the paintballs at me. 
[00:50:00]  Shoot paintballs at me.  Shoot paintballs at me.  And he has no clue.  He doesn't.  You have no idea.  How far away?  No, I know.  Actually, I've never been shot.  It doesn't matter.  If we could shoot you at 200 yards, you'd still hurt.  Is it going to hurt?  Yeah.  Dude, you're the one that's up to you guys.  You don't like me in here anymore.  If I get a free pass from now on and come in here whenever I want.  We didn't invite you.  You'll be very injured.  My last gun did 125 feet per second.  It hurts.  It hurts, man. 
[00:50:30]  Did you see Jackass?  No.  Did you see what his legs looked like?  No.  It raised welts the size of half dollars, and they were black.  Forget about it.  I don't feel like getting named.  If you're going to go far enough, I'll...  You've got to be like...  Oh, you're a pussy.  I knew it.  Only in the butt.  In the ass?  Yeah.  You're acting all brave on the radio.  You're a pussy.  I'll take it.  We'll do it.  How many shots?  How many shots?  20.  Absolutely not.  You're an ass.  How about a game of asses up at the...  Roger?  He goes how many shots.  You know what?  One shot would do it.  So then you know what? 
[00:51:00]  You don't fly like a little girl.  You know what?  I bet you I won't.  John, what's up?  Yeah, this guy...  The other day, I was looking to the sports guy.  I thought to him every day.  And he's on there.  And they had some guy who was coming in who was going to be all drunk and hammered.  Maddie.  Because he hadn't drunk for God knows how long.  But he was there and he said,  Oh, you know what?  I'll do you guys a favor.  I'll drive this guy home.  I'll give him my livo.  And he was plugging his company out the air.  I'm allowed.  They called me.  You got a problem with that?  No, they didn't call you.  You were there.  How do you know they didn't call me?  6.30 in the morning, they woke me up out of sleep. 
[00:51:30]  All right, scum?  Whatever, man.  You're a sea dump truck.  All right, scum.  All of a sudden, he turned into T.J. Hooker.  I know.  Look how brave you are.  Okay, scum.  Oh, but he doesn't know the facts.  They woke me up at 6.30 in the morning.  I don't care about that show.  Don't have fun with them.  You're busted, scum.  They put on a good show.  I don't care.  You know what?  So what are you trying to say?  You don't want me here to go with them?  You don't add anything to our show.  Well, I hope maybe they'll have better luck.  Dan from Hoboken.  Of course, Rick wants to do asses up. 
[00:52:00]  Damn, Dan.  Let me get Psycho Mark on the air.  Psycho Mark.  Have you talked to your doctor about Stacker 2?  Hey, there it is.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Dude, I got my paintball gun.  I'm going to freeze some paintballs,  and I'll have that thing shoot around 300 feet per second.  Yeah, he's doing it.  That'll leave wealth on his back like grapefruit.  I got my paintball gun. 
[00:52:30]  He's backing out now.  Five shots.  I'll give you five shots.  You are such a whiff.  Why don't you stand like a man and take 20 shots right in the sack?  You know what?  Okay.  We only need to stop.  He said he'll take five shots.  Five shots will do the trick.  Yeah, but from how far away?  I know you'll be point blank.  You'll put it on my skin and shoot me.  Ben?  Not only that, Mark has like a top-of-the-line paintball gun.  Yeah.  This thing is like...  You have never been hit.  Five shots, I'll do it.  Have you ever been hit by a man?  No, I have not.  I'll do it.  You're so stupid.  See, this guy, Dan from Jersey, is a genius. 
[00:53:00]  He actually has a solution.  Why not kill two birds with one stone?  Put the hair paint and the paintball guns and shoot Limo Anthony in the head.  So don't stick.  All right, guys.  We'll see you later.  All right.  People coming up with ideas for you.  And we want to do one of these ideas tomorrow night.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, hey, Doug.  Perfect thing for Limo Anthony.  Yeah.  Human dartboard.  No.  Oh, come on.  But you can round off the edge of darts a little bit.  Can't throw some darts at you?  All right.  Those big long darts.  How's that? 
[00:53:30]  Hold on.  We'll make it here.  What is a kill?  Doug, you're on to something.  I'm going to hang up on you.  Okay.  Because we need to do some wheeling and dealing now.  Okay.  I wasn't even coming tomorrow night.  Listen.  I wasn't.  Listen.  Go ahead.  You need plugs for your stupid business, right?  That is floundering.  It's not floundering.  It's doing very well.  It's the only reason you're starting to call the sports guys.  Let's be honest.  Okay.  You're wrong.  If you become a human dartboard, we can negotiate here.  Okay.  Plugs for darts.  Plugs for darts. 
[00:54:00]  Right, Ed?  What are we going to do, though?  Actually throw darts into them?  Yeah.  We'll protect your spine.  Oh, thanks.  I've seen this done before.  Yeah.  But it's done by those guys that put the blockheads, that put the nails in their nose,  and put the vice grips on their nipples and whatnot.  You really want to hurt me.  No, I want to see you, you know.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  I just want to see you jump around in pain for a little bit.  I'll do the pain pulls. 
[00:54:30]  I'll do the pain pulls.  I don't think they're going to allow that, though, obviously.  Darts, though.  Very easy.  We can do it here.  Now.  How about you take one from a potato gun?  That could kill them.  You know.  A potato gun.  I think it's just going to be nice to me.  It just goes over the edge.  I'll take the darts.  You'll take the darts?  I'll take one dart.  How could you take a dart?  Do I get to protect myself in all my vital areas?  Man, you want to be loved.  Vital areas. 
[00:55:00]  You want to be loved so bad.  Actually, I didn't mean to love.  Shut up, man.  He wants to be loved so bad.  I'm surprised he'll come in here with a bandage and an eye patch.  You'll take darts?  I'm not allowed in here.  My girlfriend.  Never mind.  Your girlfriend won't allow you in here?  Why?  She takes you over the edge.  Hey, we got some darts right now.  Well, when she becomes of age, then she'll understand what the show's all about.  She's 24.  Here, I got darts right now.  You don't have to wait for the road show.  Let me see one of those. 
[00:55:30]  For each dart that hits your back, we'll plug your web...  Absolutely not.  Why?  One plug?  That's nothing.  No.  There's four darts.  Ant gets two, I get two.  Give me one of those.  Let me see if they have the tips on.  They're not even that sharp, man.  Look.  Let's see.  Feel.  Oh, that's nothing.  These things are worn down.  And we said you had a hairy back.  You got enough protection.  You barely get a quarter inch in you.  Here's the deal.  Go ahead.  Here's the deal.  For each dart we throw, we plug your company.  Okay?  If we get one to stick, which is possible, and a stick is like it sticks and then falls 
[00:56:00]  out, five plugs.  Five plugs for your company.  Look at what you're aiming at.  What do you think?  Why?  Let's do it.  We'll do it?  Yeah, let me go.  All right.  Someone's got to...  Honestly, someone's got to...  Whoa!  I aim for the wood.  I hit the wood.  Don't do it in the dark, Jack.  Did you see?  Look at the mark on the wood.  I know you do.  I aim for that, my friend.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Because this guy needs plugs bad.  I don't need plugs.  Fine.  Listen.  Listen.  No.  Rick, you've got to listen. 
[00:56:30]  We need to figure out how to protect the spine.  That is really crucial.  Spine.  Thanks.  Just the spine.  These aren't even going to go in.  They're too blunt.  You got any hammerheads?  Mine's going in.  Yours is going in.  And something to protect the spine.  We'll take a break, and you're going to take darts to the back, right?  Next.  I'll take darts to the back.  All right.  What?  If it hits a rib, he could get quite an infection in the bone.  Who cares?  It's him.  Well, I know.  It's not nice. 
[00:57:00]  Why?  Why?  What have I ever done to you?  Trust me.  I will take great pleasure in this.  Wow.  I can get a pinky.  God damn it, he's tall.  I can hit his pinky from here.  Mitch from Survivors here.  He's got to be 7'4".  Oh, my God.  He's...  He's...  Wow.  You guys throwing at me, too?  We've got to tell everyone.  Mitch from Survivors.  Yes.  Australian Outback is here.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  He just showed up.  Ah.  And we're throwing darts at you next.  Finally, we've got a show.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, you probably shouldn't go for his back.  It might hurt something.  But the place you could go for it is throw him right at his ass. 
[00:57:30]  Why not his back?  I'm a little worried about the back, too.  Yeah, you got it.  What if we kill him?  That's a good case.  Do you think we paralyze him and he's still rolling in in a wheelchair going,  Hey, no, I don't take it personally, guys.  You know, it's cool.  I still like it.  You need anything?  All right, Keith.  Let's see if he's up for that.  He's up.  All right.  Listen.  I'm going to respirate him.  We're going to have to throw him at your ass like Game of Ass is up.  I'm not happy about it, and I'm sure you're not.  But it's safer that way.  Shoot for cork. 
[00:58:00]  Who's going to shoot for cork?  You're going to have to pull your pants down.  No, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  You've got to put this.  No.  I'm talking like we're going to enjoy that.  Hold on.  I'm having a hard time just listening to O.P.S.  Limo Anthony just pull his pants down.  It's got...  No.  The dark will go right through the pants.  They'll go right through my skin.  They're going to be covered up.  Get a grip.  See, this is clothed or none at all.  No.  The back.  If we're doing the back, then you've got to take your shirt off. 
[00:58:30]  No, I'm not happy with this.  But we're not throwing it through a suit.  No, no, not a jacket.  What's wrong with the shirt?  No, I'll take the shirt off.  I've got a T-shirt.  It's got to be the back.  Just bareback?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  No plugs.  You'll get plugs anyway.  You'll never get another plug.  Never get a plug.  Ever.  Because now you're backing out.  Everyone was counting on, you know, here and you get darts to the back.  And now you're, like, you know, fooling around with the rules of the game.  Ed, help me out here. 
[00:59:00]  Come on, Ed.  What, bareback?  Ed has to be bareback.  What's the difference between going back and a shirt?  You have to go back and a shirt.  You think it'll hurt more?  I don't think it's going to effing matter.  Tell you the truth.  Once it goes through the shirt, which it will, it's the same thing.  It's not like it's armor.  You're going to hurt me.  You've just got to throw it harder.  The shirt goes through.  Because Steve's trying to get video for the website.  It'll just be a...  I don't want that on the website.  Whatever.  No plugs ever.  Ever.  Ever.  We'll even change the codes. 
[00:59:30]  We usually change the codes when we, like, fire someone.  We'll just change them.  This is it.  Either I walk out and never be with you guys again,  or I have to get darts thrown on my bareback.  Yeah.  Darts on the bareback.  T-shirt.  This guy's saying that he threw darts to his friend and punctured his kidney.  You've got two.  That rocks.  That rocks.  It does rock.  This is just reminiscent of Eddie Haskell and Lumpy.  I swear to God.  Come on, Dave.  What do you think is Eddie Haskell?  What kind of...  And poor Anthony is Lumpy. 
[01:00:00]  What kind of...  To use the term from yesterday, Anthony, what kind of underpants do you have?  Boxers?  No.  It's just serpents.  See, I don't want to see that either.  I don't want you to see it.  If you had the boxers, it was doable, right?  Garrett?  No.  Stinky?  Oh, God.  He's trying to call you by your real name.  It's a little weird right now.  All right, Anthony.  I'm just saying, whatever he wants to do, shirt or no shirt, I mean...  Shirt's got to be off.  Because we've got to make sure we're not hitting your spine or anything crazy. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, for that reason?  Well, that's good then.  Okay, yeah.  So that way we can...  No, because I want to see him popless.  No, I just thought...  Because you wanted it to hurt more, but I'm just...  Well, that too.  ...hurt the scene.  Once it goes through the shirt, it's over.  And it'll just be funny to see his stupid, hairy back.  And you don't want to ruin your shirt.  Exactly.  There's so many laughs involved with this.  No, I mean...  I had to really...  I've been enjoying you for two and a half years to get me back.  I'm going to enjoy this.  I know you are.  And we're going to do it next.  So get ready.  Do we have the spine protector?  So now we're going just back? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, he's taking the shirt off.  No, don't take the shirt off until we're ready.  What kind of spine protector is that?  Dude, you've given us a lot of credit.  That thing's just as thick as his spine.  Any deviation either way.  You don't forget about it.  You know what?  Five plugs is not enough.  I want unlimited plugs whenever I can.  Like Louis Black.  No.  Come on, I've done a lot.  It's not like you got arrested.  We're just going to throw a dart back in.  Louis Black was in a jail cell for 28 hours or whatever it was. 
[01:01:30]  You know that.  But you get it.  Almost.  All right.  You've got to understand, you don't do this, no plugs ever.  You do this, you get lots of plugs today.  And then you'll be known as the dart guy.  What about plugs in the future?  Possibly.  Always have my mic on at all times?  Annoying laugh.  Dart guy.  No, we cannot agree to having your mic on at all times.  Mic on at all times.  Always shut it off.  No, you're playing with the rules.  We're on.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on. 
[01:02:00]  A gigantic boom box is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG 7.  Okay.  1-0-2-7 WNEW.  This show is turning out to be better than yesterday.  Remember what that guy said earlier?  He said we should go home because we're not going to be at yesterday's show?  We took on the challenge and it's shaping up to be a good one today.  Is that your dark show in music? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Good.  I love the crows.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Wait.  I want to say something to you.  I want to say something to you.  We'll get to you in a second.  See what I'm saying, Mitch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand that.  Constant attention is needed.  How long would he have lasted on the island?  Oh, man.  Hard to say.  Maybe a day.  No.  If he was the one that fell in the fire, they'd have left him in there. 
[01:03:00]  That's it.  Ouch.  Without a doubt.  You could have turned into the Lord of the Flies.  You could have heated the whole camp with that blubber.  Sorry, sushi boy.  Whatever.  Imagine him running after the pig instead of Mike to feed everyone on the island.  He would have gone hungry.  Catch you.  Oh, man.  All right.  As you can hear, Anthony is sharpening the darts.  Wait a minute.  Sharpening the darts.  Anthony's been sharpening the darts for, I don't know, since we started commercial. 
[01:03:30]  Let me steal, Anthony.  Let me steal.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's a dart.  All right.  Here.  Give him the stank so he can sterilize him.  These things have been blunted for a while.  Wait.  I'll get to you in a second.  I'm going around the room.  You're last.  Stephen Lynch is in the studio, Anthony.  Need a limo?  Dave?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute. 
[01:04:00]  Dave.  I could capitalize on this.  You have to put a tarp in the back seat for the blood spurting from your orifices as it  fit all over me.  Oh, here's a...  We got some tape of the limo pulling up to pick up Stephen.  Wow.  That doesn't sound like a limo, but what the hell?  Maybe it is.  Also, Mike DiNicola in the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while.  Very nice to meet you.  Where have you been, man? 
[01:04:30]  I was on the road.  On the road?  I was doing all the horrible radio spots.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Green Bay?  Yeah.  Murphy.  Murphy in the morning.  Is that where they just go, you know, they say, hey, Mike DiNicola's in the studio, and  then they watch it.  Mike DiNicola.  Be funny for ten straight minutes, and then they have to cut you off because they have  a weather break.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  He's the really angry guy who's been there for 40 years.  Yeah.  And he's got the two sidekicks that hate him.  Let's go to the weather.  It's going to be cold.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[01:05:00]  So what do you think about the pack?  Oh, they look good.  They look good.  Yeah, they sure do.  They sure do.  I've been a cheesehead for years.  But you're being too genial.  They're really angry at each other.  You walk into the studio, and it feels like you're in trouble.  Like, why does everybody hate each other?  Oh, really?  Like, Mommy and Daddy have been fighting?  Yeah.  They've been stuck in Green Bay for 40 years.  Yeah.  Well, the two sidekicks were young, and they were cool.  But the Murphy guy was just this evil, hateful guy.  Always the way.  Yeah.  And then he was like, so, why don't you just be funny? 
[01:05:30]  Think you can handle that?  And I'm like, I don't need to make it at 630 in the morning.  So what did you say?  Yeah, how much do you make?  What does your wife look like?  Yeah.  I bet.  That's always a good one.  That's a good comment.  That shuts right up my pina coli.  We learned that today.  Also in studio, Mitch from Survivor.  Hey.  The seven-foot white guy.  Right.  Great way to describe.  Well, he is.  An ex-Harlem Globetrotter hopeful. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we learned that about him so far.  That's a good way to intro him.  Yeah.  Also, annoying laugh, Anthony, from Top Knox Limited.  Need a town car, Mitch?  I may.  I may.  I'll have to get your card.  Oh.  Once you got the card, you're done.  He actually put an electronic tracking device in his car when he gives them out.  I know where you are.  If you take him up on his offer, just, like, make sure he picks you up about a block or two 
[01:06:30]  from your house.  Oh, okay.  That's so wrong.  Anthony on the phone.  What's up?  Hey, Limo Anthony, you douche-dyke.  I got a question for you.  Thank you, sir.  You want to update your website?  It still says Opie and Anthony FM talk.  I know.  I know.  It's okay.  FM talk?  You've been there for two years.  I've been working with him for two and a half years.  I don't have time.  That means I'm busy.  Oh, yeah.  Where did you make your website on?  MyFirstAOLWebpage.com?  Microsoft.  Hey, that's good.  Look at everything he's got on his website for Top Notch Limo. 
[01:07:00]  A home, about us, special events, vehicles, reservations, rates, references, corporate accounts,  e-mail us, and links.  Serious e-mails only, people.  Here it is.  Top Notch Limo.  You know what?  Don't do that because they're going to just bang it out now.  Imagine yourself and your guests being whisked away for an elegant evening in a prestigious limousine.  Well, then call someone else other than Top Notch Limo on your way to your special occasion.  We cater to your special day at Top Notch Limousine. 
[01:07:30]  Imagine being pampered by the most professional, friendly, well-groomed industry show person in the industry.  Well, you like my show.  Well, you're losing your hair.  You've got back hair and big sweat stains on your arms.  What are you doing?  I'm giving out Yankee Crankies in the back of that table to driver?  You're a jerk.  Top Notch can and will fulfill any of your transportation needs.  Let us take you into the new millennium in the style you deserve.  Oh! 
[01:08:00]  Let's go again!  King, King, Carl.  Top Notch Rimmel.  Where you want me to go?  Top Notch a rickshaw.  You get a hot crotch limo.  Hot crotch limo?  Hot crotch limo.  Top Notch Limousine is the official transportation company of the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Oh, it is?  Oh, really?  How about that?  It's not.  It's not.  No, it's not. 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  Are these retroactive plugs right here?  Coming soon.  Top Notch Calendar Girl and Top Notch Sports Picks.  That was a year ago.  That was a year ago.  That's what we do in a calendar contest.  Yeah, all right.  You know what?  Are the darts ready?  Because I can't wait anymore.  How about limo?  We have tires.  Bill, what's up?  What's going on?  It's just like, oh, my God.  Bill.  Bill.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  What's going on?  Hey.  What are you guys doing?  Don't make your fantasies of a fairytale wedding come true.  Our chauffeurs will arrive on time.  That's your big selling pot.  Are you letting?  Geez, thanks.  You really ran out on the list.  You know, not a minute early.  So often, I asked in discreet and courteous service.  Why are you killing me?  Discreet and courteous service.  Make your entrance grand.  You're killing me.  Why are you killing me? 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Doors open and look out.  He'll show up on crime.  Congratulations.  And then stand behind the yellow line, please.  I'm talking to the driver.  And you've got porno links on there.  No.  The whole hot show link is on there.  It's supposed to be gone.  By the way, Stephen Lynch will be playing some new songs for us on the show today.  Yeah.  Done with you.  Done with me.  Are we ready?  Where are the darts?  Where's Stinky?  Stinky. 
[01:10:00]  Who's got the poison tip darts?  Well, that's a good question.  This is sick.  Thank you.  Isn't this wrong?  What wonder?  Thank you.  I know.  I said get off the site.  That's what I said.  You're my son.  No, it's not.  Get off the site.  Let me tell you.  You can't even get the top-notch limousine right now.  Topnotchlimo.com.  It's getting pounded.  It's getting pounded.  It's sick.  Grab your mic for a minute.  What do we do to sterilize?  You threw a pen at me, Anthony.  Good job.  I got two effing darts.  I'm going to hurl at your back. 
[01:10:30]  The pen really hurt.  Ooh.  Go.  We burned them with a Bic lighter and then rubbed them down with alcohol.  Daryl.  Daryl.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  I think we're ready.  Yes.  I imagine everyone understands what's going on here.  Annoying less Anthony will be removing that sweat-stained shirt of his.  He'll be facing a wall.  You are just a cruel human being.  I know and I love it.  You just gave me a great compliment. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  I know that.  I know it too.  And you love to see other people.  All right.  So Randy's telling me to double in, double out, but I think I'm just going to shoot this  court.  Well, hit me with your best shot.  All right.  Listen.  So here's the deal.  For every dart that hits you in the back.  How many darts are we allowed to throw at you?  Four.  Just four?  That's it?  Yes.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  For every dart that hits your back, you get a plug.  No.  And whatever.  No.  And anything that sticks, I get ten clubs.  No.  Five. 
[01:11:30]  You can't change the rules now.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  All right.  Turn the stinky cam around.  Where's Anthony going to stand?  I don't want our listeners to be able to see this.  Stand against the wall.  Where are you going to be standing, Anthony?  Are we micing him?  Okay.  I think it's time to get up.  All right.  Well, let him stand there.  And then, Rick, adjust the camera quickly so I can take a look and make sure it's okay.  I'm good.  I used to be on a lead, man. 
[01:12:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Of course, I was after, like, 12 beers before the first game started.  I don't know how I placed over.  All right.  Take your shirt off.  No.  Stand just like this.  No.  No.  We've got to make sure we don't hit the spine.  That's the only reason.  Okay.  Make sure you mic him because the noise, that's going to come out of him.  These are really sharp now.  All right.  Are we ready?  Who's going to?  Wait, wait, wait.  Me and you got to get odds are even, so who takes the first shot? 
[01:12:30]  One, two, three, two.  All right.  All right.  Hank goes first.  You're going to throw from there?  Yeah.  This is, like, a pretty legit distance.  All right.  Get out of here.  Hold it.  Come on.  Wait.  We should get the visual.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's give the visual here.  The tool is against the wall.  The tool?  You know, I would avoid turning around like that all the time.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:13:00]  He keeps wringing his head around.  Hey, make sure you know that I mentioned.  My eye.  Okay.  His spine is covered.  But is it really covered?  Well, I'm thinking, like, a little out of that one side.  I could probably take out his foot.  Yeah, there is.  I think I see the nerve that goes through his foot.  Anthony, vertebraes 7 and 12 are exposed.  Okay, Anthony, stop moving. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, and I'm going to get a double lumbar for out.  No, don't bend down.  Maybe we can arch it in.  Anthony, move closer.  No, this is how far a regulation dartboard is.  All right, go ahead.  Remember, if it doesn't hit you back, you want to take a plug.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  There's a hole in the t-shirt! 
[01:14:00]  Come on, man!  That was a great shot, man.  Oh, yeah, I put that right in the shoulder blade.  All right, wait.  Right in the effing shoulder blade.  All right, three to go.  Opie!  Wait, did you get the plug for that?  I forgot where I work the pain!  Vital transportation, 1-800-GO-VITAL.  God, you are a puss.  All right?  You're taking it.  All right, Opie.  Opie's pitching from the Little League, Mom.  This one's going to hurt a lot more.  Yeah, Opie's really close. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God.  No, because I know what he's just saying.  No, don't turn around like that, Anthony.  You've got to put an eye out.  Don't turn around.  I'm very injured.  Opie's pretty close, too.  Opie!  Wait, I want to go for it.  No!  Don't turn around.  All right.  That's a tough shot, Opie.  A little low.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, he nailed him in the love handle.  Man, he lived near me right in the love handle, man. 
[01:15:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I know.  This is the most fun you can ever have.  You see that chart bounce off that line?  I get a plug, right?  Yeah, you get a plug.  It didn't even stick in.  Top-notch listings.  516-756-1663.  Oh, look at you.  Damn.  Make it stick.  Make it stick.  Come on.  $10 if it sticks.  No!  No! 
[01:15:30]  Come on, Ed.  It's caught.  It's caught.  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ask the room officially for that one.  No.  No.  It's caught, but it didn't.  We have blood.  I have blood.  We've got blood.  You've got one more.  You've got one more.  That's not.  You've got blood.  Hey, wait, wait.  You get five plugs. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, good.  What do you want to do?  You want to do them all in a box?  Do you want to spit them out?  He's bleeding.  He's bleeding.  I got to eat the shirt tonight.  Come on.  Oh.  Yeah, there's a little.  Oh, my God.  He's bleeding.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  You can take a break.  You need to take a breather?  No.  We don't want to wear this tattoo.  Oh, my God.  What a little tissue on.  Did you see it hang there for a couple of seconds before it fell out?  Briefly.  Come on.  All right.  Oh, man.  He's worried about his T-shirt.  He has a little blood. 
[01:16:30]  So get him in the same spot.  He needs the shirt tonight.  Sorry to wreck that.  What should I do, Sensei?  All right.  Leave my fat rolls alone.  Where should I go?  How's the anticipation, man?  Not knowing when it's actually coming.  The worst in the world.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Isn't that terrible?  Opie.  Yo, come on, Opie.  That's some really skillful shots here.  Opie, you can get...  Come on.  Just wait.  Come on.  No.  Shut up.  Rick, shut up.  You'd make a great terrorist, Rick. 
[01:17:00]  Shut up.  You want to talk?  Shut up.  You don't know when it's coming.  Three, two, one.  And it was two of them.  You threw it at the same time.  I didn't throw up.  Anthony, I swear to you, I did not throw another dart.  I threw two darts.  Who threw the other dart?  I don't know.  Someone else in the room.  Mitch.  What?  Mitch.  Mitch.  He's blaming Mitch.  I wanted to throw one.  I wanted to throw one.  I didn't get to.  Let me see.  Pull the shirt down so we can see the...  No.  No, I'm serious. 
[01:17:30]  Let me see.  The hole.  Let's see the actual wound.  Yeah, we got to see the actual wound.  I don't want to pick my back.  Well, just pull the shirt up or something.  Let the prisoner go, Rick.  You're sweating.  There's beads of sweat.  You're free.  You're free.  You're free.  Try sitting there while I'm throwing dogs.  You're not going to have a hatred on me.  All right.  So how many plugs...  How many if I get ten plugs?  And I'll pick and choose when I want to use them.  Oh, wait.  There was not ten.  Ten?  You got...  There's no way.  Five for Anthony's second one.  How many plugs have you done already? 
[01:18:00]  Two.  Two.  So five plus the one I did, six.  And we'll give you an extra one for that other person that threw it at your butt.  So seven plugs.  Okay.  There you go.  Well done.  And after one, I'm very impressed.  We will play those plugs on the Sunday night show.  Go to the back.  Wait.  We got to see the back.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Let's see a good shot of that back.  No.  Turn around.  I want to...  Turn around.  I got to see it.  I got to see it.  How did he get the...  Oh!  Let me see.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:30]  That was a nice one.  Oh!  And then Rick rips more hair out of his back with a duct tape.  Insult to injury.  The one I threw up?  Yeah.  Did you see the way it hung?  Yeah.  For a little bit and kind of went, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then it fell out?  Did you see the marks?  Yeah.  It left a good one.  Look at how happy you are.  Did you see the marks?  It left a good one.  I will think about this for the next two months.  When I'm feeling down, I'm just going to start laughing like a little school.  Isn't that great?  Something to just perk you up. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Certainly.  Bravo, Anthony.  So, Mitch, Survivor, who's the...  No.  We got Mitch from Survivor.  We got Stephen Lynch.  Go for University.  Go Panthers.  Basketball.  There's one of my plugs.  Six left.  You're using that as one of you...  Yeah, it's my alma mater.  Oh, my God.  My alma mater.  Christa.  Hi.  I just have to say something.  Yeah.  When I first started listening to the ONA show, I said, oh, you know, maybe they're a little 
[01:19:30]  too sexist.  But now I have to say, all men and women on the Opie and Anthony show are created equal.  No, no.  I think I got to tell you that.  I think the guys are treated worse than the girls lately.  Without a doubt.  Anthony, now, it's a good thing you didn't ruin that shirt.  Well, it might.  Where'd you get that?  I guess I got it, um...  I don't know.  Where?  Just a booze.  Oh, five left.  TJ, what's up?  This should be the only way people get plugged out. 
[01:20:00]  You got to get well with thoughts.  I agree.  I agree.  All right, guys.  You got to see the blood on his T-shirt.  It sounded pretty painful out here.  You might want to, yeah, plug up the hole or something.  Yeah, put something over that.  Hey, Uncle John wants to know something.  Uncle John.  Yeah, I saw that.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, Uncle Anthony, I just got a question.  John, how are you?  Shut up.  I'm pretty good, thanks.  One quick question for you.  I have.  If I offer you a dozen flows, will you take a lethal injection? 
[01:20:30]  I'll do it.  All right.  See you, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brendan.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know in Full Metal Jacket, when they start whipping private piles with the bars of soap?  Yeah.  Little Anthony, you know that these guys are not your friends, right?  I'm realizing that more or more about a day.  That's funny.  They'll call me when they need something, but when I walk in here, they hate my guts.  You're going to be tonight laying in bed, and you're going to start to cry. 
[01:21:00]  Without a doubt.  I'm crying already.  You make me sad, bro.  You got to say, bro.  I think I'm so scared sometimes.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Take it.  All right.  Hands finger, though.  You want anything?  You okay?  Yeah, I'm all right.  All right.  Now you'll probably talk to me after two years.  No, I just want to know, because you're very entertaining.  I want to know if you need anything to cover up your cut with that you got on your back,  or anything to eat.  All right.  Something to drink.  Okay.  I'm just trying to be nice to him.  That's all.  You want a beer? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I do want a beer.  What beer have we got?  What do you want, man?  I want a bud.  No, no.  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  Buzz it, buzz.  No, man.  People all know what a bud means.  The more plugs left.  The right part was just listening to you roping it in.  Showing exactly what was going to happen.  It's a deal with the devil.  You never get the wishes that are entitled to it.  That you're entitled to it.  We're in Co-Satan.  Greg.  Hey, Greg?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  What's up?  Man, what's the matter with that guy?  I don't know.  That guy is dumber than a bag of hammers.  Well, Anthony, man, you got to get your head examined.  Anthony's dart did stick to the back of...  Yeah, I'm laughing, Anthony.  I laid that in.  You know what that shot was?  When I'm trying to double out, and I'm shooting the bottom of the board,  I need a six, and I was shooting for the three, so you try to lob it in.  That was it.  And it was a perfect, like, it had enough arc to it that it stuck in at a little bit of an angle  and then ripped some flesh out as it tipped back down. 
[01:22:30]  I was very happy with that shot.  I was smiling when you were doing it.  I certainly was, but not as hard as hope you was.  You really enjoyed it.  I love that stuff.  Especially with me.  God, I love that.  All right, good job.  Yeah, bravo.  All the plugs to other times, right?  Anytime you're on, you can plug.  Right.  You got four plugs left, and you can use them wisely.  You didn't read the contract.  It's got a time limit, you know. 
[01:23:00]  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  Yeah.  So lots to go.  Stay there.  All right, let's move on with the giant mosquito, I believe, is next.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around, chilling people.  Oh, there he is. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, a giant mosquito seen crossing the Triborough Bridge.  Oh, giant mosquito.  You're convinced it's one mosquito, and they're trying to find this one mosquito.  No, what I meant was there's a bunch of mosquitoes under one breed.  So, giant mosquito breed.  The big thing, you know, he's going to say there's a bunch of chinks running away.  Can you name all the different mosquito breeds?  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  I know, I can look at pictures of them.  Yeah, pictures of them.  I like a picture.  Whoa.  Going on in Queens.  All right, listen, this gets really good.  I'm going to have to, let's let the tape ride.  All right.  Here we go.  The giant mosquito in Queens, killing people.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around, killing  people.  Apparently, it affects your immune system in your brain. 
[01:24:30]  It's called, I can't even pronounce it.  Here we go.  It's Homer Simpson, everyone.  Did you figure out how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it. 
[01:25:00]  Try again.  I need the word in front of me to pronounce it.  All right.  Someone give him the word.  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  Dude, I was laughing so hard, I just started dry heaving.  Giant mosquito.  Are you?  Yeah.  Giant mosquito.  Look for the giant mosquito story.  I'll run you up.  Rick eagerly looking for the giant mosquito story.  I can't even pronounce it.  I can't even pronounce it.  Encephalitis.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  All right.  I got it. 
[01:25:30]  You got the word in front of me.  All right.  Go ahead.  Spaz has the word in front of him.  Third death fear from Encephalitis.  That's my sister's name.  Encephalitis, you get your ass over here.  Your sister's spatula and levonates the inside.  Encephalitis.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You know, I was driving home down to Southern State.  You know, I saw the big mosquito behind me.  I got really scared. 
[01:26:00]  I sped up, but he came up alongside me and he just wowed me.  I couldn't believe it.  He had a big KKK dog t-shirt on.  I was shocked.  I'll shock you.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  That's my leader.  All right.  Let's get back into the giant mosquito story.  And it inflames the outer layer of your brain.  That's what happens.  The mosquito's carrying.  In severe cases, these are some of the symptoms you may get. 
[01:26:30]  Severe headaches, muscle aches, high fever, stiff neck, disorientation.  Then you go into a coma, have a couple of tremors, a convulsion or two.  Then you're in paralysis and then could die.  Incidentally enough.  It's the same thing that happens when listening to K-Dog.  You sure you didn't get bit by this mosquito?  Scott Herman's in here, our boss.  Scott, have you been listening to the audition tape of K-Dog? 
[01:27:00]  No, I didn't.  Oh, you're missing all the fun today.  Can I hear it?  I'm a little scared to play it for you because we want our jobs.  We don't want you taking K-Dog and putting him in our time slot.  I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  All right, let's be back to the tape.  There are things that are symptoms that people infected have been showing.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug sprays.  The residents are being sprayed. 
[01:27:30]  They're spraying like sumps and stagnant pools of water and brush.  Not the people.  So damn you, it's a mad house.  Do you think they're just running around with this spray and spraying people as they're going about their business?  Put them in stupid soakers full of DDT.  No.  There were tables set up with officers in like that outbreak suit. 
[01:28:00]  And they had to cut her in and off.  They were just spraying people as they won't find a table.  That's the picture I saw.  Oh, my God.  If I just like cracked his head open right now, would I be charged with anything?  Or would it be a public service?  This is scary.  All right.  All right.  And so all throughout...  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's get back to it.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug sprays. 
[01:28:30]  Now, actually, there are ways to prevent yourself from getting hit with a mosquito in Queens.  Hit with this mosquito?  Yeah, he's trying to say...  What's the word?  Encephalitis.  I'm going to pee myself, I swear to God.  Encephalitis, where's back tea? 
[01:29:00]  Where's your sister back tea?  It's still a giant mosquito at this point, Ant.  Yes.  One large, giant mosquito.  Thank God they're spraying the residents of Queens.  Just walking around with bug sprays.  Spraying the residents.  In Queens, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks went outdoors.  Use insect repellent.  That includes DEETs.  D-E-E-T.  Avoid outdoor activity from dusk to dawn.  Don't remove water from cars and jars, because that's where miscues later eggs and, you know, 
[01:29:30]  settled water.  And check your home for tight-fitting screens indoors.  Much like the rules of going out there in the summer, you know, don't wear heavy clothing,  don't run 100% in heat.  It's just common sense, people.  Follow it.  Wait a minute.  You're telling people to follow common sense?  Yeah.  I am stupidified, man. 
[01:30:00]  It's common sense, people.  Follow it.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's move on here.  I think people should know these things anyway, but, of course, you've got morons on TV and  people like me on the radio right now.  That's true.  And all the preventing causes to do.  Anyway, we're going to get right back to music.  And we're going to kick you off.  Actually, it would have been a rinse.  I'm sorry. 
[01:30:30]  It's too hot.  Yeah.  Anyway, we've got some more of these along the way we can coach sports after the fixed  zone break.  It was V-R.  We're at W-I-C-R.  It would have been great.  New draft.  That was good.  I hit the note.  I hit the post.  I thought I said it was from Seth Miletus.  Seth Miletus.  People saying, stop. 
[01:31:00]  I can't see.  I'm laughing so hard.  Please, please, stop.  Oh, you're stupid.  I never knew there was somebody that couldn't speak worse than me.  I couldn't even say to our router.  Please, I could say encephalitis.  Encephalitis.  Don't throw a mosquito.  A bunch of mosquitoes.  Not a big giant mosquito, you freaking idiot.  I can't even speak. 
[01:31:30]  I can't even speak.  Encephalitis.  Encephalitis.  Ain't that right, Maggie?  I can't even speak.  I can say it.  The idiot's got the worst book. 
[01:32:00]  I'm right in front of him.  One of the few diseases that are supposed to be phonetically.  No wonder I got so far in radio.  Mushmouth over here.  Say, he's got a gig.  What a visit.  They're probably some poor chap.  Somewhere in the Midwest.  Got a booming voice.  Sounds like a testicle beside the happening app. 
[01:32:30]  Could be doing voiceover, making millions of dollars.  Never got a chance to go on the radio.  And we got a, uh, uh, Chris Cheekhead.  He's got a gig.  He's got a gig, maggot.  The Mets losing is a heartbreaker.  This is a heartbreaker. 
[01:33:00]  I'm ready to quit the business.  I'm going to become a speech, Jennifer.  Might as well.  What the hell?  If this fool gives me a DJ,  it's a red baggie.  That's right, Doc.  I'm hanging out with the dogs, Mad Dog and Kate Dog.  Mad Dog and Kate Dog.  Mad Dog and Kate Dog.  I'm a fan.  Can you remember that?  That's a fan.  Hey, it's a Kate Dog on, uh,  where the hell am I?  Oh, yeah, the fan. 
[01:33:30]  All right, we're in the middle of Kate Dog's, uh,  sports break here.  Mad Dog and...  What next, Martian soccer?  What are you going to comment on?  Something on his planet?  Or your home planet of Tatooine?  Where the hell are you from?  You're a friggin' alien.  He's got to be camping from Earth.  Listen to him.  He's from the same planet that brings you the, uh,  giant mosquito.  Giant mosquito? 
[01:34:00]  It's a big swarm of mosquitoes,  you friggin' idiot.  Even if there's one mosquito with a derby  and a cigar stick out of his mouth,  rafted people for change.  Mad Dog, would you like...  Him and his partner in several years,  the black guy.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.

[01:40:00]  Wendy, bravissimo.  All right, hold on before I get this third girl.  I can't even clap after that.  I have no blood left in my body.  I'm supposed to go somewhere else.  My arms are asleep.  How are you doing?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Anthony, what's up?  All right, guys, I'm sitting in traffic.  Yeah.  My windows are open.  I got the radio loud as always.  I got some 50-year-old lady next to me looking like I'm an effing pervert.  You are freaking out.  It's hysterical.  I hope we have some listeners out there that are willing to crank up their stereos during this. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, dude.  I hope they're cranking something.  Guys, keep up the good work.  I got to go.  Take care.  All right, Anthony.  Very good.  All right, where's Stephanie?  All right.  Okay.  You're barely standing.  You all right?  I wonder why, baby.  Yeah, really?  I don't think so.  All right, Stephanie, you ready?  So who's in the lead so far, guys?  First one?  Barely, though.  Yeah.  Good to get her.  Irene's in the lead. 
[01:41:00]  You'll give her props?  You want to make out with her?  Of course.  Yeah, of course you do.  Oh, a little more making out there.  That sounds like a challenge.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Very good.  Fabulous.  All right.  Let's go to Stephanie.  You know what to do, right, Steph?  All right.  She's got the piercing from earlier.  How's it feeling down there?  It's feeling good.  Yeah?  All right.  Here we go.  Hold on. 
[01:41:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We have to come down to that.  Hold on.  No!  All right.  Hold on.  Stay out of the bushes.  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:42:00]  Everyone in the studio certainly enjoyed that, but you can't say it.  Yeah.  The F me harder thing.  Very lovely and stuff, but nice touch.  I do believe the FCC would find it legal.  All right.  So.  Nice touch.  Exactly.  That was nice.  Going for the gold.  All right.  Yeah.  Sometimes you've got to go above and behind.  In Sydney.  All right.  You ready to try it again without the cursing?  All right.  Here goes Stephanie. 
[01:42:30]  One more time.  You've got to beat Irene.  Wait.  Hold on.  What?  That's in my topless.  Doesn't that get some kind of credit?  That certainly does.  It sure does.  Yeah.  You've got to give her that.  It's beautiful things.  I can't believe you guys.  You've got to give her that.  Very nice days.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Stephanie, you better do it topless just so you're...  Well, how about I do it?  She's in this topless.  All right.  I'm a...  Hey, you know, whatever.  No.  Can we check the rule book on this?  No. 
[01:43:00]  They're setting up scenarios now.  Wait.  Absolutely not.  And bring me that dildo.  Of course.  By the way, Limp Bizkit tickets.  Oh.  Look at this.  Ben, how the hell did you do that?  You just printed those on the printer, didn't you?  Yeah.  All right.  So, you're going to do a topless?  I'll do a topless with her.  With...  You know, I'm so confused.  Why don't you all just get topless?  There they go.  There's all our teenagers topless once again. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  Stephanie, go ahead.  You've got to get on the mic, though.  Remember, this is a fake orgasm.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All right.  What do you guys think of Steph?  No?  Why is there a hotel founded?  That was very good.  Wait. 
[01:44:30]  What do you guys think?  Are we going to vote?  All right.  Maybe we should have, like, maybe 10 seconds of each again.  So, we keep making an idea.  All right.  All right.  This is...  And Stephen Lynch is here.  Steve, sit down and shut up.  We got the girls.  Wait.  Am I in the lead, though?  Yeah.  But this is the finals now.  So, the first round doesn't count.  This is it.  Oh, man.  Okay.  All right.  We'll go one after another after another without any interruption.  So, Irene.  Ready?  Well, actually, you're in the lead after the first round.  So, why don't we go...  Who was in third place, guys?  Well, based on everybody's reactions, Stephanie... 
[01:45:00]  All right.  Stephanie, you're in third place, so you have to go again.  You'll start it off.  She's completely topless.  She got pierced earlier.  Here's Stephanie.  The finals of the fake, fake orgasm contest.  Fake.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  There we go.  There you go.  All right.  Let's go right to Wendy.  Top of us, of course.  No.  You guys ready?  Yeah, here we go.  Wendy. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[01:46:30]  Wendy, was that your idea, that little...  Who did that?  All right, and Irene.  Ready?  All right, Wendy's obviously in the lead.  This is for the 150 ticket.  Obviously.  All right.  Oh, it didn't hurt her. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, it didn't hurt her.  Oh, it didn't hurt her.  Oh, I'm getting too excited. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I love her. 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  Remember, she's only 18.  You don't mind if we give the tickets, Irene, do you, Wendy?  Because you did a good job, too, and so did Stephanie.  But there you go.  I think it's pretty obvious we won that little competition there.  You want to give her a make-out kiss?  A little make-out kiss?  You know, a victory kiss.  Sorry.  Congratulate the winner there.  A make-out kiss.  I can't go back. 
[01:48:30]  Stop that.  Get back.  Stop that.  I'm trying to cut to a make-out lap around the track.  I do it.  You blame me.  Oh, no.  You need blood in your brain to think.  Bill, what's up?  Listen, guys, during that last one, that's kind of putting me way over the top.  I've currently got 450 watts annoying as much of Northeast Queens as I can right now.  Yeah.  I think that just put me and my whole neighborhood way over the top,  and I'm currently just going to put an ice bag on my M bag. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, we recommend that.  The swelling will go down in the next few hours.  All right, Bill, thank you.  A lot of people saying this Teen 2, the sequel from the Teen 1 we did, better than the original.  Thank you.  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, guys, I keep looking for the damn coin slot on my radio.  I feel like I should sing it for this show.  The coin slot.  What a country.  You get this for free.  You turn it on the radio, you get it for free.  Yeah.  Great show, man.  All right, Charlie.  Good luck.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  You know, last time I heard anything like that, and I was on the phone, it cost me $4.99 a minute. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, I was just, I'm in Morristown, New Jersey.  I'm like, I was at a stop sign.  I was like four cars back from a stop sign.  I had, I guess, one of the girls, I don't know who it was.  Not that it really matters.  They were all good.  Moated her brain out, and I just had a look to my left, and there was a whole little lead  field just sitting there looking at me, all the mothers and fathers and everything,  and the kids.  Outstanding.  It's Teen 2, the pajama party.  Stay there.  The OTI has absolutely gone. 
[01:50:00]  I've been on track of the day.  1027.  Number 20, number two.  Okay, listen.  I don't know if you've seen the audio yet, but it's all over CNN.  Mike Tyson's over there.  Is he fighting again this weekend?  I've lost track of Tyson.  I guess he's in England, fighting, trying to get his boxing career on track again, and  the people just thrilled to have him.  They can't stand him.  They're outside his hotel, just protesting, saying that they should throw Mike Tyson out 
[01:50:30]  of England.  Mostly the women's groups, Anthony.  The women hate him.  The women hate him over there.  They don't appreciate what he's done to women over here in our country, so they feel he doesn't  belong in their country.  He was put in prison for rape.  And then there were allegations by his girlfriend and ex-wives about abuse, all kinds of stuff.  He should have to go back to prison for marrying the lady he's with now. 
[01:51:00]  That's not funny.  What are you talking about?  So, CNN, they got footage of Mike Tyson.  I guess the protesting has gotten so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police  station, because they're just protesting wherever he goes.  So he's out this window at the police station with a megaphone trying to talk to the lady  protesters.  That's what you want him to do.  Like, talk to the protesters.  That won't piss him off any more than they already are, right? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, I'm sure.  Hey, are you running me, bitches?  Any of you running, bitches, want to come in here and see who could take a punch like  Robin Givens?  Come in, you bitches.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Come in, I'll kill the first one.  Look at you, you toothless bitch.  Come in, get out of my face.  I'll punch you.  Come in, you pasty white English whore.  Why are they so angry at me? 
[01:52:00]  Why are they angry?  Because your queen is a twat.  Come here.  Oh, look, look, you see, you're Mr. Queen.  Come here, Queen.  Come on, I'm body-blood.  Oh, you, you can't even take a punch.  You're like Spinks.  You're like Spinks.  I came out of the corner and pounded at him.  Now I'm going to bang the queen over her chair and do her in the caboose.  It feels like I did to that Miss USA or whatever the hell it was I banged. 
[01:52:30]  I went to prison for that.  I want a man in prison vision.  I want a man in prison vision.  I'm going to make you look like Lady Di after I'm done with you.  You're going to be bleeding.  You can rest assured.  Where's Prince Charles?  I'm going to bang you in your big ears.  Come here, okay, here's a fine lady.  Now I want to talk sense to you. 
[01:53:00]  I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  They don't look at me like that.  What will I do?  I don't even understand.  I'm like an animal.  It's like the Beatles over there.  They're chasing them around.  Yeah, but they want to kill me.  They don't want, like, a water glass or nothing.  They want to kill me.  Thank God they're all too much pussies to have guns over here. 
[01:53:30]  Even the police don't have them.  Look, here's one of them Bobbies with that big stupid hat.  Look, I'm killing his ass.  I'm like King Kong.  I'm just running around.  Remember the King Kong movie?  It was in New York and they couldn't do nothing.  That's me in England.  Oh, God, my God.  The cops don't have guns, so I can run rampant.  Look, I'm beating up the police.  Are they throwing soccer balls at you, Mike?  Yeah, soccer balls.  That's all they got.  Look, I'm like a big guard booth in front of the palace. 
[01:54:00]  And they got them guards with the big fuzzy hat on.  Yeah.  You can't make them change the expression on their face.  Yeah.  Watch this.  See his expression now?  Now, look at this.  Look, now it's a bloody expression.  I made a change.  Now, I'm going to take that furry hair and stick it in your keister.  And that's only to make room for my giant member.  Look at Prince William. 
[01:54:30]  Look at that fine young little man.  I'm going to be himself and abuse him.  I love England.  We're the Spice Girls.  I'm going to skewer him like a shish kebab.  I'll get all of them on there at once.  Come here, you whores.  Come here, you liney whores.  You all got bad teeth.  Your teeth, they suck.  You got the scurvy.  I got a cure for that.  Yeah, that's a cure.  You look at it. 
[01:55:00]  You look at it, bitch.  Come here.  You ain't never seen my nothing.  Where's you, Grant?  I'm going to do him too.  Come here, whores.  All English whores.  Lady Di was a whore slut, man.  Well, I'm just trying to be popular.  I'm like Mighty Joe Young.  Rum got rampant through the city.  Lady Di was a slut, whore. 
[01:55:30]  Going out with a towel head.  Thinking her country all pissed off or not.  Look at me just knocking down inside me.  Shut up, bitch.  Am I making any headway?  Oh, I'm winning over the people of England.  Well, they're still a little pissed, Iron Mike.  Well, they're all stupid.  You got two TV stations that suck.  Yeah, look at my Mighty Metal, you bitch. 
[01:56:00]  They only got two teeth.  And that whore head.  I went to that, I went to the London Zoo the other day.  Uh-huh.  And they tried to stop me from leaving.  Something about an escapee.  Shut up.  That Aaron Ferguson is a fat bitch.  I don't care if she's on that weight watchers or nothing.  I make her lose weight.  I go, come here.  Come here.  You know why you eat so much?  Because your mouth works.  Now it don't. 
[01:56:30]  Now you lose some weight.  You fat bitch.  Look, your hair's red.  Now so's your nose.  And now so's your ass.  Oh, no, here's the queen.  Come here, queen.  Right in the face.  Don't drag up, slut.  You're making Mike Tyson laugh. 
[01:57:00]  Trying to stay in character.  Man number, Rick screwed up a sound of it.  Now I'm going to go climb Big Ben and swat a aircraft.  T'was beauty killed the beast.  Hey, it's Feyre.  Take me back to Skull Island. 
[01:57:30]  There's the Earth English people.  You've got the big, gappy old chief.  I love the Irish Republican Army.  I'm learning how to make car bombs.  You people suck.  Am I winning them over?  Am I winning them over?  I don't think so, Iron Mike.  I appreciated what the Lufo offered there.  They won with their aircraft back in World War II. 
[01:58:00]  Look at this.  I'm going to bite off Prince Charles' ears.  That's a hell of a meal.  That's a hell of a meal.  He's got some big ass ears.  He's a ugly mother.  He should go.  I bet he's got a little acorn in his pants.  Because his wife's a whore bag.  Lady Di was going out with a cowher head.  People of England. 
[01:58:30]  Your lady Di was a whore.  How am I doing?  You're not doing too well there.  He had a moth like Don King's hair.  You're going to have a heart attack.  I can't eat more flack from you linies and Prince Charles is going to take it in the leather cheerios.  I can't eat more.

[02:09:00]  dorm when i was in college so whoever that guy was i must know him and uh elephant i know it as the  down in the valley there's the butt nut the walnut right at the end of the tunnel uh uh fuzzy fruit ball  i always used to do all of them uh dude you gotta uh describe these in a way that you can do it on  the air all right well the one that is interesting is the the light at the end of the tunnel thing  all right the light at the end of the tunnel is you um you sort of remove any wrinklage by stretching 
[02:09:30]  out the bag right and you kind of tilt your hips back so you push your butt out so it's a cross  between the squirrel on the trampoline and the turtle head so you have caught sort of like this  sort of i can't i don't know it's a stretched out bag with a little light at the end of the tunnel  i he's not doing a good job all right you take your right hand yeah you and then you take the 
[02:10:00]  loose skin right we don't we know what you're doing where you straight out straight out forward  straight out forward so now there's no wrinkles there's nothing right now whatever's left above  that kind of shelf yeah you you pull your hips back so it's pulled back within you so it almost  looks like the front headlight of a train sticking out of the tunnel you completely cover up your junk  with what you just pulled so it disappears yeah by pulling your hips back it removes any slack 
[02:10:30]  a train line coming out of the tunnel  and the walnut actually the walnut is you take your junk you wrap it around the side of the bag  and you kind of do a little you know how like the the grain of the bag goes you know up and down 
[02:11:00]  right with the ridge you wrap the junk around the side give it a half twist  so the junk now goes horizontal it looks just like a walnut  the fuzzy the fuzzy fruit bowl is you take it all sort of the buffalo bill but from the reverse angle  you kind of bend over so you get a little bit of the gravity pull  you do a little shake it looks like fuzzy fruit jiggling in a bowl  dad thank you very much well thank you all right holy f this is the gayest stuff 
[02:11:30]  this is gay he and his roommate did this  fag  tony what's going on guys i was about to hang up because i was like god i'm just not going to come  off very funny after that that that seems really inventive anyway what we used to do in bars 
[02:12:00]  and we would just unzip our zipper pull out your the main captain guy wrap them around your wrist  and like take a pen and draw like a little watch face on it and uh we'd go up to girls and say uh  check out my new uh snakeskin watch and they would like look at it and actually at times they would  like touch it and be like what does it mean and then we would just kind of sit there with a big  smile that connects at the top of our head and uh it it was good old fun so you're standing there

[02:23:00]  yeah  little league was just not my sport  you know what's the worst too about that  it's cause  I mean you are traumatized  I'm sure as a kid  you're up at bat  infield's coming in  there's always a dad  on like the other side going  yeah easy out  he can't hit John  he's going right behind him  now he's taking him from the dead  he's like thanks man  that was the father of the pitcher  who was always a son  he was a son of a bitch  on every seat  his head's out in right field Johnny  he's watching 
[02:23:30]  yeah but I could not stand in the box  no  I hated that  yeah  and it always seemed like  ah it's coming right  coming right floor  it's coming right at me  coming right at me  the guy knows it  so he's just gonna hit me  it doesn't matter  take care of the bejesus out of him  well when you hit about 7th to 8th grade  yeah  you get them kids to start getting pubes  and their jeans take control  oh  oh dear stop it  wow  oh you're very naughty  yes Dr. Smith yes

Man, you swing  and beat come down over your nose.  Sorry, this is for the older kids.  Yeah, that's all we're for.  Jack's Hammer  only gave us $20 for shirts,  guys. Give me a break, all right? I'm the one  supporting this goddamn team.  Did you get your effing jacket? 
[02:30:30]  Does it say your names  on it? Then back off.  I collect garbage  from your house, you little crap.  We're getting some great instant feedback.  Like Vinny from the Bronx, every time I'd get thrown  out, the coach would slap me on the ass and say,  way to hustle. Way to hustle.  That was always a good one. Berga, the ground  ball takes a bad hop at your face  and the coach tells you,  stay down on the ball. It won't come up.  It comes up. Yeah, it works  when you're in the major leagues. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, you lay the glove down and  hit the tip of your glove and pops right into  your mug. Ow!  You ever fall on your cup?  It's a cup.  No, it's just while you're waiting.  You get freaking  done. I'm going to wear my cup.  It was always ridiculous looking.  Oh, man.  Not much in there to hold it in place.  I had these little, tiny, tiny  little cups. Yes, yes.  Tell me about your cup, my dear boy.  Oh, dear.  I was a fat kid. 
[02:31:30]  I tried to slide once, you know.  Face forward. Face forward. Yeah.  I belly flopped so hard  on my cup because you know how the rubber's around it  and it would dig into it.  On your pew.  It would take one party and not  And you know, five seconds later, that pukey feeling's coming.  Really? You all right?  I'm all right, man. I'm all right.  That's what I'm doing.  Oh.  Saget's crying, Amy.  Get up, chubby.  It's not a hurt you, dick. 
[02:32:00]  What a dick.  Yes, the chant that we want a pitcher,  not a belly itcher.  Jason from RiverEdge.  What about the father that would get into an argument  and get thrown out of a freaking little A game?  We had a brawl after a game.  Really?  The coaches got to fight one another.  My dad was like 75, was on top of the guy.  He had him down.  I swear to God, we would just hang out  and all of a sudden you heard like the ladies go,  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!  And you turn around  and you see these kids fight  and all of a sudden it's the coaches.  Fight his dick, you want to fight him? 
[02:32:30]  I'm not going to crap out of one another.  And then my dad had some guy down  and it would just knock the crap  and just, I don't know,  maybe they didn't like her.  I don't know.  What happened?  Yeah, you know you suck when,  you know you can't hit when the parents cheer  when you hit a foul ball.  You know, you're like, yeah.  Dang it.  All right, man.  There you go.  Good one.  Good one.  I wish I could even do that.  I had one hit.  I had one hit to right field.  I closed my eyes just once and I lucked out.  How are we going to play now?  Who are you to challenge in football? 
[02:33:00]  It's a wiffle ball.  I can do wiffle ball.  I can't do, you know, baseball coming at me.  I got over it.  This is when I was like 10, 11, 12 years old.  Here's a quote when you lose the game.  We'll get them next time.  Yeah, we'll get them next time.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Josh from Wontal.  What about the mesh hats that you couldn't crease  and the Joe Fish Market sponsors  on the back of the jersey?  Dan from Massive Peak,  where they're all coming from Long Island now.  Little League was the reason why  I wound up playing Dungeons and Dragons.  I always loved when the star player 
[02:33:30]  forgot his mitt or stirrups  and the coach would tell the benchwarmer  to give up his stuff to the star player.  That's so true, man.  That's a great one.  Let's see.  We always made fun of the kid  who couldn't get cleats  and always wore the basketball shoes.  And he was like green.  Yeah, yeah.  In crazy color.  Radio Pimp writes,  what about the courage clap  whenever a kid went down and got hurt?  The best is when there are extra players  and they send you to deep center field. 
[02:34:00]  You end up standing so far back  that you're in the parking lot.  I had a kid named Diarmuid  on my block.  Diarmuid?  Diarmuid.  D-I-A-R-M-U-I-D.  And no one for some reason  could pronounce his name.  I swear to God,  I'm not making this up.  So the coach would call him Dammit.  And my mom would call him Dammit.  I swear to God,  we're in Kent Avenue Memorial.  And Diarmuid's in left field  and the coach is going,  Dammit!  Move back! 
[02:34:30]  Dammit!  Dammit!  Pay attention!  I swear to my mother.  And this big fat lady goes,  don't you swear in front of these  Goddamn kids!  Look at you!  Goddamn.  Goddamn I made up.  I threw it in there.  I'm not going to lie to you.  He turns around and says,  it's the kid's name, lady.  Dammit!  Move in!  I think we played for the same  Little League organization, man.  It was out of Long Island.  They were all the same.  Babe Ruth, right?  After you hit a foul ball. 
[02:35:00]  Good cut.  Straighten it out next time.  Straighten it out.  Thanks, Tom Scott.  Yeah.  Oh, it's that easy?  Dan from Seifert.  How about the sadistic coach  that puts you at first base  to gain confidence?  Five errors in one inning.  I pitched once  for like three batters in a row.  Oh, yeah.  I walked two guys  and one got knocked  the daylights out of it.  I almost started crying.  I was such a fairy.  I was getting my arm hurt  and I never pitched again, ever.  We got a guy  that played Little League  with you on line four. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah?  Let's talk to Charlie.  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Good evening.  I don't know who this is.  What's up, Hammer?  Charlie Brocia, man.  What's up, Hammer?  Not much.  What are you up to?  Hey, who was the Babe Ruth  on our team, man?  Who was the Babe Ruth?  In the younger years,  I was the Babe Ruth.  That's it, man.  I was, man.  I was really fat.  Charlie was like,  come on, brew, brew it up.  Brew, man.  You're just going to fall  over that little fat ass  in right field.  Forget it.  Oh, no, we win the game, man. 
[02:36:00]  He's throwing rocks  around at first base.  I was so bored.  I was really sad.  I just pick up rocks  and I throw it  at all my infielders.  See?  Let's go, Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Did you see how far  he's got that ball?  Charlie, didn't we win one year?  Yeah, we did.  The best one.  Yeah, that was, uh...  Man, I don't even remember  the best one, man.  Yeah, we were way back.  Cool, Charlie.  Hey, man.  All right.  Keep in touch, man.  All right, you got it, man.  Have a good one.  Thank you, Charlie.  Hey, come to the village, man. 
[02:36:30]  All right, I'll come down.  All right, man.  Yeah.  Oh.  What village?  Oh.  He meant the village  of Valley Street.  Valley Street.  Yes, of course.  We'll back me up on that.  Oh, we'll back you up  in that village, too.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  More instant feedback  before we move on.  We got Stephen Lynch  coming into the studio 
[02:37:00]  in here.  Stephen Lynch has arrived.  My friend's father  was thrown out of the park  for being drunk.  Between innings,  he would go out to his car  and chug a beer.  By the fourth or fifth inning,  he was bombed.  He'd come back  in the third inning.  Game over?  What are we doing?  The car ride home.  We call it rain's coming.  He's critiquing.  You're playing.  You're just smelling  like dad's beer, Brad.  Oh, God.  Dad's beer, Brad.  He's on the wrong  little league team.  Come on, Timbo.  Keep dying on the block. 
[02:37:30]  He's on feel fine.  Yeah, I look like  my little bastard  for a second.  We all look like  a single.  A couple more here.  Remember when you lost  the team with Chad  two, four, six, eight.  Who do we appreciate?  And then the team name.  Yeah, I effing appreciate  getting my ass kicked.  Now take me to Dairy Queen.  You'd have to high five  or like shake hands  or the line goes by  and one kid would put in a  you suck.  Spit on the hand.  You suck.  Shut up.  Spit on the hand. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, right.  I'm going to shake hands.  She's a school dick.  I'm going to rub my own  chunks before I shake  the hand, man.  It's like he's giving me  a hand.  It's the same thing.  Smell it.  I'm going to give myself  the same thing.  Watch, man.  I got a long  any tube, bro.  Jay from Nutley.  How about the fat catcher  who sweated from the car  ride to the game?  Yeah, but he loves  when he came.  Oh, great job, Jerry. 
[02:38:30]  Or the kid who wore  jeans in practice.  All right.  People.  Another memory.  Thanks, bro.  Yeah.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, did I hear you  say you could play softball?  I mean, you couldn't  play softball, but  you could play softball.  No, no.  Well, first of all,  we're talking about,  no, regular baseball.  Oh, so you can play  baseball, but you could  play whistleball?  As in the whistleball  that challenge?  Oh, yeah.  That old jag. 
[02:39:00]  You're reaching.  You know when one of  the listeners has a good  little jab at one  another, we laugh.  We laugh partially at it.  It just, it didn't cut it.  There you go.  You got a little.  Excuse me, but I do  believe that sucks ass.  Yeah.  Cartman has spoken.  We're going to the rat.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, what's that up?  Easy. 
[02:39:30]  Can we see your stuff?  Can we see your stuff?  Guys, guys, I...  All right.  I get it, Ed.  I get it.  I would choke the chicken  in front of everybody.  Really?  This one's sick.  Dan from Manhattan.  What about the one gay coach  with no wife, no children  that always had the really  good kids over his house  for a pool party  at the end of the year?  Come on, I'm taking 
[02:40:00]  you all out for pizza.  Years later, you found out  he was the town drunk  and molester.  You were from Lawrence.  Huh?  Do you like  having your background?  Those men wanted  to have sex with me.  Yeah.  All right, we got  to take a break.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back  in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fun!  All right. 
[02:40:30]  Marilyn Manson.  Disposable team.  Look who's in the studio.  Wendy from the  55-Gallon Jump Challenge.  Yeah.  She's also been in the  Feels for Meals box  a few times, Anthony.  Yeah.  Today was supposed  to be the big day  of our huge promotion,  Feels for Meals,  but, uh...  Well, I think you know  the story by now.  That old gag.  Didn't pan out.  I've got to come  support you guys.  Bunch of pussies around here 
[02:41:00]  that don't know  how to make things happen.  Just want to find, uh,  ways, uh,  why we shouldn't do things.  Excuses and scapegoats.  That's what we have.  So, uh, Wendy's  going to get into  the, uh,  Feels for Meals box  because we got a couple  guys from Penthouse  taking photographs  for their website, Anthony.  Nice.  Because, uh, next Tuesday  our Penthouse interview  comes out.  Yes.  A lot of people, uh,  looking forward to that.  We're looking forward to that.  And, all right, Wendy,  get in the goddamn box.  Oh.  They never take their top 
[02:41:30]  off before they go  in the box.  Yeah, notice that.  I know.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  What?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  Who's the brother?  Hold on.  Let's step on the brake  pedal real quick.  You can't check out  your sister if you're in here.  I'm not looking.  I'm not gonna look.  Dude, you're her brother.  Yes.  And she is...  Blood brother?  Yes.  Topless.  Dude, you gotta, like,  do it in the box.  No, man.  You wouldn't feel  your sister's boobies?  Why not?  No.  Rick, break out 
[02:42:00]  the prize list.  What do we got?  Dude, what would you do?  What would it take...  What would it take  to get in here...  Fill up your own sister?  Fill up your sister.  50 bucks?  Rick, Ben, what do we have?  We've got a dark tomato  coffee mug.  Wow.  You want 50 bucks  to touch your sister's boob?  See you idiots  from yesterday  abusing us  because we're talking  about prizes.  You're like,  hey, you guys  don't need prizes.  You guys just continue  making us laugh.  Who cares about prizes?  This is why we need prizes.  If we had something cool,  this guy would be  filling up his own sister. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  But instead,  we've got a coffee mug  to offer him.  What would it take?  What would it take  to...  Brewer tickets.  We can absolutely  get you  Brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  For Irving Plaza  December 9th.  We're all going.  Brewer tickets.  I'm so telling Dad.  That's all right.  Wendy, what do you need?  She's cute and stuff.  Even though she's your sister.  Have you ever seen  your sister naked?  No.  No?  No.  Wendy?  Do you think she's cute?  No. 
[02:43:00]  What?  What do you need  for this to happen?  Uh, what?  No.  Brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  Dude, we'll give you  Brewer tickets  if you reach in the box  and just cop a feel  off your sister.  It's one of the hottest  tickets in town.  Oh, my.  Jeff, are you kidding me?  No.  You?  Why not?  Why not?  Uh, meet?  Meet and greet?  Yeah, we will get you...  We'll get...  Believe me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Before I answer...  Before I answer,  don't go to the next level on us.  I know what you guys do here. 
[02:43:30]  No, no.  This is where it ends.  You get the tickets  and the meet and greet  backstage, yes.  But that's it.  Don't say, you know...  Whatever.  Tickets, meet and greet.  You put your hand in.  But now somebody's got to confirm  because he could just  put his hand in.  Did I put my shirt on?  No.  What?  No.  That's my brother.  Yeah, but that's okay.  That's why it's, you know, cool.  Oh, like people haven't squeezed  their sister's boobs.  Wendy, your top was in there?  Yes.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  What's your name, uh...  Jeff.  Sir?  Jeff?  Jeff.  All right.  Jeff, step over to the box.  All right.  Cop a feel.  You know what maybe we should do  to ease her up a little bit?  What?  Maybe we line up all the guys  to the side  so she can't see  who's walking up.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to guess  which hands are your brother's.  How's that?  Wait, put a blindfold on her.  What does she get if she gets them right?  If she gets it right,  then you guys get to meet  Jim Brewer backstage.  How's that?  She'll get it right.  Oh, I got it in my brother's hands. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Get back out of the box.  We've got to put them  that tells me the feel  won't be as passionate  as everybody else's.  We've got to put a blindfold on you.  Yeah, put a blindfold on.  Get stinky in here.  We need a bunch of different hands.  But now someone is going to have  to look in.  Get her own hands, too.  Get her own.  Someone's going to have to look in  and make sure  that there's contact  and it's not just  an errant little brush of a nip.  No, Rich, you can do it.  You've got to grab on.  Rich, you can do it  from the back door, right?  Hey, hey.  Wait a minute.  We're just talking.  No.  The back door of the box. 
[02:45:00]  He just said a BJ  with my stuff.  Oh, I thought we were  talking about that stuff.  Sorry.  Don't marry me.  Carlos.  Hello.  Hey, Carlos.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  I don't know.  That is disgusting  what you guys are doing right now.  Hey, shut up.  You're going to read it.  You're going to read it.  Don't read it, Carlos.  Shut up.  You'll be listening.  Hey, wait, wait.  Check his ID.  That's not even his sister.  Shut up.  You're reading it.  But they want to go see Brewer, man.  No, they're brother and sister.  You can tell.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm hanging up.  Hang up on him.  You're going to read it. 
[02:45:30]  You're going to read it.  All right.  Wendy is blindfolded.  She's blindfolded in the box.  Oh, God.  Michelle, what's up?  You guys, I love you to death,  but you've reached an all-time low.  No.  Where are you going?  This is a sin.  I have a brother,  and there's no way on God's earth  I would let him do this to me.  Hey, shut up.  You would do it for a Jim Brewer ticket.  Right.  No, I'm telling you.  There's not a chance.  I'll be in therapy for the rest of my life.  Oh, you're all hung up.  Oh, okay.  I don't want my brother to touch me.  You've got hang-ups. 
[02:46:00]  You'll be listening.  Who's going away?  Come on.  There's nothing else to listen to in the afternoon.  Right.  Where are you going?  To listen to a rack, guys?  All right.  Here he goes.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Somewhere in the line.  No, hold on.  What's up, Bob?  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  We're lining up the guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got Wendy in the box.  Wendy, are you topless?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You guys are guaranteed the Jim Brewer ticket.  If you guess which one is your brother feeling you up, you get to meet Jim Brewer backstage. 
[02:46:30]  What's wrong, steak?  I'm not a stinky.  You're even disgusted by the show today.  No, I feel bad about this.  No, no, no.  Shut up, you're eating.  All right.  You cannot say a word.  No saying a word.  And no, like, little Morse code tweaks or anything.  You just got to do what everyone else does.  What we will do here, gentlemen, you will step up to the box, put your hands in, grab a hold,  give a little, you know, juggle, a little, little bouncy bones, a little feelage, a little brushing with the hands, 
[02:47:00]  and then you step away, and then the next guy goes.  And if we can contain ourselves when the brother comes up, it'll be an effing miracle.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because I don't even want to look.  I think one, two, three, five.  We have one, two, okay, yeah, we do have six.  Six guys.  Yeah.  This is what we should do.  Everyone gets a feel.  Right.  Give each one of these guys a number, and then Wendy's got to guess what number was the brother. 
[02:47:30]  Why is everyone so close?  Because Rick's giving out the numbers.  Wendy doesn't know if you go, you're one, you're two, you're three, you're four.  She's blindfolded.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  All right.  I'm not looking over at the box.  I'm just going to laugh at every person that's coming up to the box.  All right.  She can't see you dancing, and her shirt is totally open.  This game is called, this game is called, guess, which one is your brother filling you  up?  Filling you up. 
[02:48:00]  Now, very popular game in South Carolina.  Okay.  Rick, or somebody, the most important part of this is confirmation of contact.  Okay.  You can't really see one's arm's go in that hole.  Right.  So someone has to look.  And, Ben, keep that mic on, Wendy.  Okay.  Number one.  Number one, step right up to the box.  And, Wendy, don't say anything until everyone has felt you up.  There's no talking.  That's no talking.  Number one.  All right.  Wendy? 
[02:48:30]  I can hardly hear you guys.  All right.  Right.  That guy felt you up, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Number two.  Step up to the box.  Step up.  And he puts his arms in.  Rick, can you see well back there?  Confirmed.  Okay.  Very good.  There is number two.  All right.  Number three is stepping up to the box.  Both hands, sir.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  Did number three fill you up, Gwen?  Yeah.  Okay.  Number four.  Number four.  All right.  Number four.  Number five.  Number five.  Did number five fill you up?  Confirmed.  Oh, Rick, you've seen everyone fill her up?  I've seen everybody so far.  And finally, number six.  Yep. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Here comes number six.  All right.  And here's number seven.  People are coming in the studio.  Number seven.  All right.  Okay.  All right, Wendy.  Everyone in the studio has felt you up.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You already have Jim Brewer tickets for Irving Plaza December 9th.  We're all going.  And your brother has tickets as well.  For the backstage passes to meet Jim Brewer, which number was your brother? 
[02:50:00]  Between three and four.  Four?  Three?  Three?  Three?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  Four?  All right.  Is that your final answer?  You need one?  Would you like three and four to fuel you up again?  Yeah.  Maybe you've got to get three and four again.  Yeah.  Three and four again.  Three and four.  Line up to the box.  You seem a little confused.  So, number three.  If you could step up to the box.  Number three.  Up to the box.  Now, three and four. 
[02:50:30]  Two hands.  Both of you.  Yeah.  That was the...  I think three and four were the ones that used the one-hand combo.  All right.  That might have caused the confusion.  Both hands.  All right.  Once again, it's down to three or four.  Which one is Wendy's brother?  All right.  That's number three.  Did number three fill you up?  Yep.  All right.  And number four.  All right, Wendy.  For the meet and greet with Jim Brewer, which one was your brother?  Three?  Number three. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  Number three.  Number three.  You called up your sister.  Time to show rules.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How did you know it was three?  Wendy?  Oh, no.  Wendy, how did you know?  Wendy, how did you know?  It was really quick.  It was a real quick one.  It was a real quick one.  It was a real quick one.  Well, four was pretty quick, too.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  And how was it filling up your sis?  I don't know.  Yeah, how are they?  I don't know.  What do you think, though?  No, really?  Like, how did they feel?  No comment.  No comment?  No.  Did you like...  Like, as far as boobs go, if they weren't attached to your sister, would they be nice?  I haven't even thought of anything.  I haven't seen them that way right now.  Why?  No, you got to.  No.  All right.  Oh, my God, who was listening to this?  All right, hands down her pants now.  No.  If you guys make out, we'll give you tickets for Jay Moore. 
[02:52:00]  Rascals West Orange, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Love you, Jay, but no, thank you.  How did that feel now with your brother's hands on your boobs?  They're not even looking at each other now.  They're pretty nice, though, right?  Dude, you got to fess up.  Take yourself out of it emotionally like you're a Vulcan.  We've seen your sister's boobs.  They're nice.  Yeah, they're nice.  Yeah, whip them out, let's see.  Take a look.  They're just breasts.  Look.  Look.  Take a look. 
[02:52:30]  Do not turn around.  Feel them, though.  Won't turn around and look.  Wow.  That rock.  Can you imagine the dreams both of them were going to have?  You guys already gave me portrait nightmares before.  Now we're doing it, yeah.  Wow.  God.  Let me tell her come on the stage.  Unbelievable.  Thanks, guys.  You all right now?  Yeah?  You felt up your sister, and all it cost us was a couple tickets. 
[02:53:00]  And a meet and greet.  Wait until Brewer finds out why he's meeting and greeting you.  He might ask for a live demonstration.  Wow.  As far as boobs, how many boobs have you touched?  A lot?  A few?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're married?  You're married.  What a great way to feel other people's boobs.  You're just cheating with your sister.  You're cheating with your sister, dude. 
[02:53:30]  What a great way to get around that loophole that you can't touch other boobs when you're married.  Hey, it's my sister.  Can I break the news to your wife?  No.  Maybe she's giving a handy to her brother.  No, I'm kidding.  Now, stop.  Dude, he's a big guy.  I'm careful.  I know.  Bob, what's up?  You guys are effing sick bastards.  Hey, we didn't talk to our sister's boobs.  That's right.  You guys, though, it's unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  That's nice.  Let's bring in the incest couch. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  The incest couch.  I just hope Jeff doesn't call his wife by his sister's name.  James, what's up?  Guys, this guy is going right to hell.  Why?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, they're just boobs.  You know, in some countries, that's common.  He's married and he's filling up his sister?  I'm speaking.  And, Rick, you can confirm that he filled up Wendy's sister.  Yeah, not only once, but twice.  Yeah, twice.  Right to hell.  There's no coming back with this guy.  Rick, what type of technique did he use?  Was it the fingers up grab or the fingers underneath the bottom kind of bounce them a little? 
[02:54:30]  It was more like when you're sticking your hand into some place, you're not sure where  it's supposed to go.  So it was just kind of one hand.  Yeah.  And then he quickly grabbed so he wouldn't get bit by the snake and pulled out.  Pulled his hand out.  Right.  And they were nice, though, right?  Firm and...  All right.  Wonderful.  Let's go for...  Wonderful, see?  Let's go for the dirty Sanchez.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Well, you guys got the backstage. 
[02:55:00]  Very good.  For Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  There you go.  Wendy and her brother on the O&A show.  Nice.  Not a god damn it.  That rolled.  This show has just taken so many twists and turns into depravity.  Love it.  You fit right in.  Be proud.  You guys are nuts, huh?  Be proud.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's about as funny as a thinking schoolboy. 
[02:55:30]  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me go nuts.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  O&A, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie, I'm Anthony.  What a couple of asswipes.  1-1-2-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5 </pre>
