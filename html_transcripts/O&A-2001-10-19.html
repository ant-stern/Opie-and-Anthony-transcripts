<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with its characteristically raucous and sexually suggestive introduction.  The hosts immediately launched into a discussion of their varying ratings across different markets.  They expressed frustration with their poor performance in Chicago and Dallas, blaming inadequate promotion and inconvenient air times, contrasting this with the success and strong support they received from the program director in Philadelphia, Tim Sabian.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to playing and dissecting hilariously bad celebrity impersonations – specifically those of Ozzy Osbourne and Jimmy "Superfly" Snooker – which prompted listener calls debating the relative awfulness of each.  The hosts also mentioned a recent interview with Ozzy Osbourne.

A major segment was devoted to the announcement of a "Boobalander" (and later "Boo-O-Lantern") contest, a competition for women with breast implants to have their illuminated breasts photographed for an online vote, planned for both New York and Boston.  Further topics included their brief, blurry appearance on WWE's SmackDown,  low audio quality issues during a recent performance by the band Days of New, and the availability of video clips from a recent road show on a fan-run website.  The show also played a highly profane audio clip of former baseball manager Earl Weaver answering fan questions, promoted the upcoming WWF Pay-Per-View event "No Mercy," and gave away Yankee tickets.  The broadcast featured a song by Carminoch and Joey Baseball, "How You Doin'," which was heavily ridiculed for its repetitive lyrics and poor quality, despite its unexpected popularity on some New York radio stations.

A studio guest appearance by Joe Perry of Aerosmith followed, discussing the upcoming "United We Stand" concert in Washington D.C.  The conversation included debate about the eclectic lineup (Aerosmith, Michael Jackson, NSYNC, Backstreet Boys), the post-9/11 atmosphere in New York City (with many NYPD and FDNY callers detailing the high number of false anthrax alarms), and a spontaneous giveaway of Yankee tickets to the first NYPD officer and fireman to visit the studio.  The hosts also recounted past prank calls made to J.J. Walker during his political talk radio show, highlighting the contrast between his serious on-air persona and his "Good Times" fame.  Video clips from a recent road show, including footage of a female comedian, Patty, being pelted with beer by the audience, were also shown.

A significant chunk of the show featured a prank call segment targeting J.J. Walker, followed by a phone interview with Dennis Quaid.  The prank calls involved increasingly absurd questions, including speculation on Walker's potential gang affiliation and a fake sperm-shampoo advertisement.  The Dennis Quaid interview unexpectedly focused heavily on Quaid's early film *Bill*, with tangents encompassing his band, his appearances at Hogs and Heifers saloon, his reflections on Ground Zero, his flying experiences, and his opinions on Russell Crowe.  His guitarist, Jamie James, also briefly participated.  The post-interview discussion included listener calls about the prank call, *Bill*, and a listener sighting of the hosts in *Penthouse* magazine.  The "Boo-O-Lantern" contest was discussed again, along with the hosts' impact on Washington D.C. radio ratings.  The show concluded with segments on a cringeworthy past interview with Joe Pesci and a brief interview with Jesse, a contestant from *Survivor: Africa*.  The *Survivor* segment covered drinking cow blood on the show, Jesse's African experiences, and listener-submitted video clips including one depicting a host attacking someone with a paint gun.  Mention was made of previous interviews with Joe Pesci and Jeff Probst.  The *Survivor* segment also featured a discussion about Jesse's experiences filming *Survivor: Africa*, including a near-lion encounter, rumors of violence and threats against the production, and his chapped lips from dehydration.  A police officer caller jokingly suggested a collaboration with Jesse on police work, and a call from Kimmy, a *Survivor 2* contestant, led to the hosts teasing and dismissing her.  Numerous jokes were made about Playboy and Jesse's potential appearance in the magazine.  The conversation also touched upon Jesse's sister Raysa's elimination from *Survivor: Africa*, which the family learned about only upon watching the broadcast.  The show ended with promotion for a Samsung DVD/VCR combo and *Boogeyman* DVD giveaway, another announcement of the "boob-o-lantern" contest, and final off-color remarks from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's Friday! Friday! Friday!  Long head, curly hair, smiley face.  Shut up!  Red rocket, red rocket. Red rocket, red rocket.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  They're all pink on the inside. Marijuana is the bomb. 
[00:00:30]  Find a thing! Find a thing!  What are you people? On dope?  Hey, everybody! We're all gonna get laid!  Time to be bad.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  So, I tell ya, that call is one of my favorites.  That, hi, mom, I'm in porno. Love that one.  Just the mother completely freaking out at the thought of her little girl that she raised,  sent off to school, now earning her teeth, spreading them.  Beautiful.  And the mom wouldn't even say porno. 
[00:01:30]  No.  You don't do that thing that you said you're doing to me.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, no.  Mom, I'm doing porno.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I have to get things going.  No.  No.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, ho, ho.  Yes.  Oh, ho, ho.  All right, a couple phone notes for ya.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  And anywhere else, not including Chicago.  Oh. 
[00:02:00]  866-2774.  Wow.  Hey.  Chicago could care less we're alive, Anthony.  I understand that.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, what are we on?  I saw the late night ratings for our show in Chicago.  Three in the morning.  They might as well turn off the power to save money on electricity.  It's bad.  Here we are.  We're all cocky because we're doing great in New York, Boston, and Philly.  Yeah.  Chicago, they might as well just turn off our show and save the money on electricity. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, bad news.  Horrible.  Ah.  When the hell are they going to put us on at a reasonable hour in Chicago?  We're on in the middle of the night, and that doesn't help matters.  They don't really understand the show, obviously.  They could care less.  They don't really keep in touch with us.  What time are we on in Chicago?  The company probably forced them to put our show on, I'm starting to think.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you could tell the people that are dedicated to this program, they put us on when we're supposed  to be on.  Right.  Other people, it's like, all right, they twisted our arm. 
[00:03:00]  We've got to put this dopey and crap head on, and we'll just bury them in the nighttime hours.  I don't even know what time we're on.  I think we're on at 9 at night, 9 to 1.  9 to 1.  And then they rerun one hour of the show at 4.30 in the morning or something like that.  Oh, that's good.  That's healthy.  So.  Thanks.  So nothing is going on.  I mean, we had, we had like a sports guys type of ratings.  Wow, really?  Chicago.  Hmm.  Hey, I love the sports guys.  Just a little jab, guys.  Relax. 
[00:03:30]  And Dallas.  Whoa.  Same thing.  Yeah.  They can care less we're on in Dallas.  Well, when are we on there?  10 o'clock at night till 2 in the morning.  Even worse than Chicago.  Let me just tell the program director of Chicago and Dallas.  If this company forced you to put our show on, then give us a call.  We don't want to be on your station.  Then we'll just go somewhere.  If you want us part of your station and you want to try to make it work, then great.  Why don't you start calling us and let's see what we can figure out, okay?  There you go.  I mean, a lot of people should, you know, should call Tim Sabian in Philly. 
[00:04:00]  Here's a guy.  We make a lot of fun, you know, because he is a wacky, goofy type of guy.  He's a little crazy.  But he knows what he's doing.  He's motivated.  He wants the show.  He promotes the show.  He promotes it to the point I'm embarrassed.  When we're in Philly, every bus had our name on the side of it.  He had faith.  The DJs say our name every break.  You know, I mean, they love the show.  They understand the show.  And they want to make it work.  They were the first to get the, you know, the special Waus bumper stickers made for their city. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  And the other stations, Chicago.  The other stations, they don't even return our calls.  Because we're on the middle of the night.  It doesn't matter.  It's filler.  You guys are an afterthought, man.  We're filler.  We are filler.  Yeah.  And if the company, you know, forced you to put us on, please let me know.  And we'll go somewhere else.  We'll work something else out.  We'll find another station that wants to support the show and do it the right way, okay?  I'm sure there are stations in both of those cities that would love to have us on live and help their station out. 
[00:05:00]  Anthony, they're already calling.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  So, yes.  All right.  Speaking of Philly, once again, we're going to talk about Philly.  Know why?  Uh-oh.  Because Tim Sabian's a pain in the ass and he's constantly feeding us stuff for this radio show.  Because I hear from the other program directors in the other cities.  Boston, same thing.  They're a pain in the ass.  Right.  So, that's why we talk about Boston and Philly a lot.  Get on our ass.  Get on our ass and give us stuff, you know, and make us talk about your city and we'll do it. 
[00:05:30]  There you go.  Tim Sabian sent us a hilarious Ozzy Osbourne ID.  Ozzy did an ID for us?  For, yeah, the Philly station.  Great.  Can you understand a word he says?  No, that's what makes it funny.  And you know what?  He heard our interview with Ozzy yesterday.  Yeah.  And then Ozzy, I guess, came in and did this little ID and he sent it right up.  Great.  So, here's a quick chuckle because of Tim Sabian and Philly once again.  He's working it.  Once again, talking about Philly.  You're right. 
[00:06:00]  But they're motivated.  They want this show and they want it to work.  That's the difference, okay?  Here's Ozzy Osbourne doing an ID for our show.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'll see you at the 9th.  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'll see you at...  Ozzy Osbourne is going to be crazy.  Should I just say my name?  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  You might have to.  No, I was just going to insert something. 
[00:06:30]  W34.  Oh, f***ing nuts this morning.  Get me a f***ing book to read.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'm listening to...  It'll be Opie and Anthony on the Rock Station.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on the Rock Station 94 WYSP.  There you have it.  A quick laugh.  What's that then?  It's a good moment.  Hi, you're Ozzy Osbourne.  Oh, wait, I'm Ozzy Osbourne. 
[00:07:00]  Let me look at some of the papers.  Come on.  How long time this morning?  Oh, crazy.  It's been on the helicopter.  Hi, you're listening to...  Hi, this is Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Ozzy Osbourne.  No, that would be silly, no, wouldn't it?  Hey, there's a person in the basement.  Guys in the refrigerator.  Helicopter.  I can burst some type of aircraft.  You know the best part of him trying to do that ID? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  At one point he goes, there's a lot to read here.  No, there wasn't.  It was just supposed to be, hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony in the radio station.  There's a lot to read here.  Hi, I'm Ozzy Osbourne.  Oh, look at that.  I got it right.  Holy...  I got it right.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And you're...  ...listening to...  ...Opie and Anthony on Ozzy Osbourne. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, no.  It was the radio station.  Oh, mother...  I can't believe I screwed that one up.  Oh, good.  I got a helicopter in the case.  I can't be here all day.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  You're listening to Ozzy Osbourne.  No, no, no.  Ozzy Os...  No, no, Ozzy, try it again.  The show is Opie and Anthony.  Mother...  I can't believe it.  All right.  Hi. 
[00:08:30]  Hi, this is 94.  You're listening to Ozzy Osbourne on Opie and Anthony.  Son of a...  ...ing bitch.  This is difficult.  And it's so early.  It's 2.30 in the afternoon.  I don't know if you see any others.  I just got to take my thing.  I just got to catch the helicopter.  Hello.  Hi.  This is...  Who am I now?  You're Ozzy.  Oh, ****.  I can't believe it. 
[00:09:00]  I'm Ozzy Osbourne.  You're Ozzy Osbourne.  I love that guy.  It's been so long.  I've been listening to his records.  What?  Oz...  Is that Don on the phone?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  Can't go into an up-to-air number after a goddamn dog dying.  No, that was Casey Kasem, Ozzy.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  No, no, no, no, no.  You're listening to Ozzy Osbourne on Opie and Anthony.  They're 94.  Son of a...  Why, I did it right the first time.  No, you didn't. 
[00:09:30]  Green peas, crisp crumb coating, crisp...  See, it doesn't roll off the tongue.  Crisp crumb coating.  In the fjords, the salmon are frozen.  Oh, ****.  I can't believe it.  Hi, this is Austin Wells.  You're listening to Opie and Ozzy...  Who?  Oh, ****.  I can't believe it.  You're Ozzy Osbourne.  That's right.  Very good.  Okay.  I'm Ozzy Osbourne, and you are Austin Wells. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  I have to catch a helicopter.  Can I go?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  You're...  Hey, can we do a comparison?  We got the Jimmy Superfly snooker.  Which one is worse, you think?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne on your radio.  Which one?  All right, we'll play the Jimmy Fly...  Jimmy Fly!  I mean, Jimmy Superfly.  Look at me.  Hi, this is Jimmy Fly snooker.  I can't believe I screwed that one up. 
[00:10:30]  Hi, this is Jimmy Super Aussie.  No, Superfly snooker.  Hi, this is Super Lady Patty.  No, no, I'm Patty.  You're listening to the ****ing Aussie Osbourne show.  Hi, this is Opie Osbourne.  You're listening to Anthony on 94 W Aussie.  All right, can I play the Jimmy Superfly snooker?  Jimmy Superfly.  Because this takes the cake as the worst celebrity ID we have for our radio program. 
[00:11:00]  By far.  Ozzy might have beat him, though.  Pretty bad.  We might have to, you know, put a vote out there to the listeners.  Use the answer feedback and tell us which one's worse, okay?  Right.  But wait till you hear both of them simultaneously.  Well, one after another here, okay?  So here's Jimmy Superfly snooker trying to do a celebrity ID for the Opie and Anthony show.  And then we'll replay the Aussie one.  Okay, Opie and Anthony on 1-2.7.  Opie and Anthony on 1-0-2.7. 
[00:11:30]  Now, this is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony on 1-0-2.7 on WNEW.  Right again, 1-0-2.7?  1-0-2, 1-0-2.7, isn't it? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, we call it 1-0-2.7.  Okay, 1-0-2.7 on WNEW.  Do you want to say his name and stuff first?  Uh, you want to say, yeah, say anything I hate, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in.  No.  It's the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 1-0-2.7 WNEW. 
[00:12:30]  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio dog.  Thanks, man.  Okay, brother.  On your radio dog.  You know, I don't want to affect the voting, but that's still my, the worst one.  That is classic.  He's just got 1-0-2.7 on the radio dog.  Okay, brother.  Well, let's re-listen to the Aussie and see if the Aussie's up there, if it can compete with Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  Hey, this is Aussie Osborne, and I'll see you at the 9th, I thought, I forgot what year I was in there. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, this is Aussie Osborne, and I'll see you at, uh, was it, uh, I suppose she's going to be crazy with, uh, so is that my name?  Uh, this is Aussie Osborne.  I don't have to, no, I'm just going to switch up.  W, W, W, F, I'm nuts as well.  I'm getting a F, I'm about to read.  Hey, this is Aussie Osborne, and you're listening to, what's that?  Hi, this is Aussie Osborne, and I'm listening to, it'll be Opie and Anthony on the Rock Station. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, this is Aussie Osborne, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on the Rock Station 94 WYSB.  There you have it.  Yeah, I got it right there, son.  Hey, I sound energetic and stuff.  Hey, this is Aussie Osborne, you're listening to some of the cars, you don't think about it, you're at 94.  Oh, sweet Caroline, which I've never been so good.  F*** yourself. 
[00:14:00]  Hi, this is Aussie, Superfly Osborne, on the red of the heart.  One, zero, two, four.  Oh, f***, I can't believe I screwed that one up again.  What time is it?  I've been here three days, you gave me a f***ing book to read.  I've never heard something, but I can't believe I was just a little spaceman.  Okay, here it is again.  Hi, this is Aussie Osborne, and you're listening to Jimmy Superfly, a snooker on 1092, 418. 
[00:14:30]  Hike the ball.  How did that happen?  Let me get into my helicopter.  Shannon, what's up? You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I was just wondering if you can play the interview you had with him yesterday.  Well, this is what we're trying to do today.  Aussie is in Philly today, so we're trying to get him back on the show today.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So, we'll wait to see if, you know, we can get him on again.  If not, maybe we'll replay yesterday's little interview, okay? 
[00:15:00]  All right.  All right.  Yeah, I met him yesterday, too.  You did?  I went to Looney Tunes, yeah.  Oh, yeah? How was he?  Yeah, he was, like, not moving. He looked really tired.  Could you talk to him?  Well, not really. I told him I loved him, and then he left.  He laughed or left?  No, he left.  He smiled, and that was it.  Oh, you love me? This is great.  You get under the table and kiss you under a hammer.  I'm always laughing. I'm Aussie. 
[00:15:30]  All right, Shannon, thank you.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  So, which ID's worse?  I think it's close now that I hear both of them.  They're kind of in different categories.  You know, Aussie is the, I don't know, the drug-induced, the alcohol-bender kind of delivery,  where the Superfly is, I've been hit on the head with chairs so many times, I'm retarded.  A lot of people saying Superfly is a funnier one.  Yeah, Superfly, definitely more gone. 
[00:16:00]  Let me go to Craig real fast.  Hey, Craig, what's up?  Craig.  Not much.  You think the Superfly is funnier?  Oh, ten times funnier.  You know what?  Aussie did one a couple years ago for 94 YSP, which is ten times funnier than the one he did for you.  He kept saying, you're Aussie Osborne instead of not Aussie Osborne.  That's the one we've been trying to search out today.  Yeah, I did 94 plays every once in a while.  This is from a couple years ago.  And he kept saying, oh, no, you're not deep in Aussie Osborne. 
[00:16:30]  All right, we'll have Ed send that up to us immediately, all right?  All right.  Thanks, Craig.  No problem.  Hi, you're Aussie Osborne, and I'm listening to, I mean, I'm Aussie Osborne.  Who are you?  You're Aussie.  That's right.  Why do I keep getting that wrong?  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, Dave, you're on the radio, bro.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, Jimmy Flay, he got hit on the head too many times, so Aussie pretty much knows 
[00:17:00]  what he's doing, but, you know, I sort of like Aussie.  I got to go for the super fly.  Aussie's pretty cool, though.  He rocks.  He kicks ass.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Now we can take calls like this over and over again.  I like Jimmy.  I like Aussie.  I like it.  But I don't think so.  It's pretty damn close, okay?  We're going to take a quick break.  Up next, we got to talk about the Boobalander contest.  It's on.  It is on.  Game on?  Game on, and we'll do the details next for everyone, okay? 
[00:17:30]  Cool.  Real fast.  Oh, Doug wanted in?  He hung up.  Damn it.  All right.  He said we were on SmackDown last night.  Really?  I don't know.  I was going to try to get the details from Don about.  Maybe he'll call back.  We'll be back.  He's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  O&A, my singing favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes. 
[00:18:00]  Ah, Islanders hockey is back.  They won again.  Hey, how about that?  We still don't have a loss.  We still do not have an official loss.  Officially undefeated?  We have an overtime loss.  Right.  That's like a new category.  Who cares?  When's the next game you're attending?  Unfortunately, I will not be at the game tomorrow.  It's killing me, but I'm going out of town.  The Islanders will be retiring number 19 in a special pregame ceremony in honor of one  of the greatest players in NHL history, Brian Trottier.  They're bringing back all the Islanders that you know and love from the past. 
[00:18:30]  Game time is 1 p.m. versus San Jose.  All fans and attendants will get a Brian Trottier commemorative item.  Tickets still available, believe it or not.  Not many, though.  Give them a call.  1-800-882-ISLES.  That's 1-800-882-ISLES.  The Islanders have the lowest prices and best season ticket benefits in the NHL.  You'll get 40% off box office prices, free parking, and an invite to meet your Islanders  when you purchase season tickets.  Give them a call.  1-800-882-ISLES for your tickets today.  Don't forget, Saturday, tomorrow, it's Brian Trottier Day. 
[00:19:00]  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Chains Addiction, Mountain Song.  I wonder if the aliens have gotten back to him.  Doesn't get much better than that song right there, my friend.  I think Perry's just as screwy as Ozzy, only he can speak a little better.  That's about it.  We've had a lot of cycle babble on this radio show this week from some pretty big rock stars. 
[00:19:30]  We've had Ozzy, we've had Perry, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Off the instant feedback, yeah, you guys were on SmackDown last night for about two seconds.  They showed clips of Kurt Angle's media tour, so they showed a bunch of clips of him on different  radio stations and TV shows.  They showed Kurt in front of the WNEW mics, and you guys were kind of blurry in the background.  Oh, there you go.  So we made SmackDown.  Kind of blurry on SmackDown.  Nice.  Nice. 
[00:20:00]  Greg from San Francisco.  Let's hear your ratings from San Francisco.  Where's this SS radio station doesn't promote you at all?  What?  Where's this?  Oh, I guess the San Francisco station doesn't really promote us at all.  Oh, really?  I think the ratings in San Francisco blew as well.  Although Frank Caliendo did mention you guys on a San Francisco morning radio show this  morning.  You should have a road show here.  Me and the other guy that listened will definitely be there.  The other guy that listens.  Hey, you know, we don't BS. 
[00:20:30]  We don't BS ourselves or our listeners.  We're doing real well in some cities.  Yeah.  New York, Philly, Boston.  Cleveland's showing some nice numbers.  Yeah, Cleveland.  And then we stink in a lot of other cities.  Yeah.  Flat out stink for many different reasons.  I think we do our best in the cities that were heard in live.  Heard in live on a nice, clear FM.  Right.  Exactly.  I don't know if this show is made for AM when we're like, you know, talking about rock 
[00:21:00]  and roll and having artists play and stuff.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show on AM station.  Certainly doesn't help our syndicated show when we go to commercial here in New York,  you know, then the local station picks up from there.  Right.  And some local stations choose to play country music.  Country music.  That really doesn't help the image of the Opie and Anthony show.  Country music.  We're trying to show people that we're hip and young and having fun. 
[00:21:30]  Kind of cool.  We like to think we're cool.  And then they just blow that all out of the water when we go to break and you hear some  lame-ass country song.  Other stations choose to play rock and roll and then cut it off in the middle.  Well, there you go.  And all the stations run us in the middle of the night.  Well, I think as time goes on, they will look at the formula of what works for this  show and where it works and proceed accordingly. 
[00:22:00]  But, of course, the general managers and the program directors of these stations, they  know better.  They know something we don't, that we should be heard in the middle of the night.  Or they should play country songs when we go to break.  Can you imagine?  Unbelievable.  Country.  How could you ever tell your friends that you listen to Opie and Anthony?  Because then they tune in the station and they hear a country song.  Like, well, these guys, they're country fags.  Country.  You know, Tim gets it. 
[00:22:30]  Tim Savion, of course.  Boston's getting it.  And if this gets it, he understands when he's not in the secret room that perhaps this show  being live is the best thing.  Cleveland ratings.  Oh, we got Cleveland.  Is this us?  Yeah.  That's us right there.  Let's see how we're doing.  Whoa.  Hey, look at that.  Person's 18 to 34.  Yeah.  In Cleveland, we inherited a 4.0 for ninth place.  Uh-huh.  And we're now at an 8.5 in third place. 
[00:23:00]  Stop.  Look at that.  Wow, nice.  So Cleveland obviously doing something right as well.  We might have to go to Cleveland.  I think we're going to have to go to Cleveland.  And you shouldn't say have to.  I'm looking forward to going to Cleveland.  Can we wait until the spring, though, when it's warm?  Hold on.  Hey, Eric, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Listen, Anthony, I wanted to know if you're going to comment on Norman not even knowing  who the hell you were this morning.  Yeah.  He was on the sports guy.  I heard about that. 
[00:23:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  Really?  I know where I was when I was a kid.  Hold on.  You said he didn't even break your arm.  All right.  You didn't even remember that.  Eric, hold on.  Let me set it up because, you know, a lot of other people listening to us right now.  All right.  I'm going to go, guys.  You need to care.  Thank you, Eric.  Boomer Esiason was on the sports guy show here in New York.  They're on in mornings at the station we broadcast out of in New York City.  Yeah.  And they had Boomer Esiason on this morning.  Boomer.  And we've talked about this on the radio show many times.  They went to elementary school with Boomer Esiason. 
[00:24:00]  No, no, no.  East Islip, Long Island.  And Anthony, you broke your arm?  Yeah, yeah.  I got in a fight with the Boomer.  You punched him in the head.  Colin Norman.  He was a very obnoxious guy.  And you snapped your arm?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Broke my arm.  Spent the summer in a cast.  And, yeah, he's an obnoxious guy, or at least he was at the time.  I don't know what he's like now.  I would have to say he's still an obnoxious guy.  Yeah.  He was one of those guys that he was the gym teacher's pet kind of thing. 
[00:24:30]  Always was into the gym class and whatnot.  And he'd go through the cafeteria and just at the, if he felt like how he was.  And God forbid you called him Norman.  He was Boomer even back then in elementary school.  This, I'm talking, it has to be, I don't know, I think it's fifth grade.  Something like that.  Fourth or fifth grade.  And if you called him Norman, he'd beat you up.  That's what he did. 
[00:25:00]  He was Boomer.  And, you know, I think it's fun to call him Norman.  You pay the price.  So he called you out.  I call you out.  And now, yeah, he doesn't want to acknowledge it.  Well, screw him.  It happened right now.  Boomer.  All right.  The Boomer.  You know, why didn't anyone tell us that the first song, Days of New, did when we were in Philly,  completely blew on the radio?  Yeah, I heard it.  And through the headphones that we were listening, the vocals were so low, 
[00:25:30]  and other things were up too loud, and then the whole song just dropped out in the middle.  See, I got the reputation around here for being very obsessive about the radio show.  I really care about our radio show, and I'm a pain in the ass with the people we work with  and they're all because I want the details and I want everything to sound as good as I possibly can.  So I knew there was a problem with the first song, Days of New, did in Philly.  I asked everybody to the point where they started talking about me behind my back, like, 
[00:26:00]  oh, my God, will you shut the F up?  It sounded great.  What's his problem?  I go, I think there was something wrong with the vocals when Travis was singing Touch, Peel, and Stand.  Yeah.  And everyone right to my face, no, no, it sounded effing great.  I heard it in Studio C, through the air monitor, and blah, blah, blah.  Trust me, trust me, it sounded great.  It sounded great.  That should have been a sound check song.  And I'm saying, no, I know there was a problem.  You know, hopefully we'll fix it for the other two songs they do.  No, man, I'm telling you, it sounded great. 
[00:26:30]  The other two went well.  The third one, especially, was great.  The sound by that point, he had everything down.  But the first song, awful.  He was mixing as it was going on, and then, like I said, at one point it just drops out.  Well, we have a copy of it.  Yeah, let's listen to some of it.  Why didn't any of you guys call us and bust our balls and say this stunk?  I saw a couple of instant feedbacks that said, wow, what the hell's going on with the sound?  And I heard it through my headphones.  But you can't, like, in the middle of the song go, hey, could you stop?  The sound really sucks. 
[00:27:00]  Although we should have.  Oh, my God, I'm getting distracted.  All right, we'll talk about that in a second, that Ben's got up.  But, you know, just to show why I'm so obsessive about our radio show.  Yeah.  I got a copy of The Days of New.  I just want to play, like, the first minute.  Let's hear.  This is why I asked so many questions, because I knew I was right about this one.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, hey, hey, wow. 
[00:27:30]  That's vocals.  That's vocals.  Right there.  It's like, what?  This is awful. 
[00:28:00]  It's the acoustic karaoke version. 
[00:28:30]  Just sing yourself.  And they're just dry.  There's nothing on it, you know?  Should be a little, uh, little verb on there, maybe.  Perfect example of why I'm so obsessive.  There you go.  In case you think I'm insane.  That's horrible.  We're on in, like, 15 cities.  That should never happen.  Never.  Awful.  It was horrible.  Thank God it was able to, uh, get better for the other two songs. 
[00:29:00]  Thank God they'll be back next week, uh, to do it again.  Oh, that's right.  That won't happen.  There was no sound check.  Like, no one made sure everything was cool, uh, before they started.  So by the beginning of the song, I'm sitting there going, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hopefully you can just get it going.  And then, uh, we didn't even get to the middle of the song, but the whole thing just goes down to nothing,  where it sounded like it was, uh, being, uh, recorded from another room.  That's too bad, because acoustically, when Travis gets going in a radio station studio... 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Sounds good.  He could kick it.  Oh, well.  Hey, we're Steve from foundrymusic.com.  He's not eating.  I've just been informed that, uh, about 30 video clips.  Oh.  Yesterday, we were talking about the road show from, uh, Philly.  We had hundreds of pictures posted yesterday.  Yeah.  Now the video clips have made their way to the websites.  You can go to opianthony.com to get the link to our unofficial website.  Uh, just in case you don't know it, it's foundrymusic.com. 
[00:30:00]  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Foundrymusic.com.  But go to opianthony.com, and there's a nice link to make it easy for you.  One of the easiest sites to navigate on the web, I must say.  Isn't it?  Foundrymusic.com.  Look, thank you.  That's very kind of you.  I was trying to find a picture the other day, and I clicked on something,  and I actually started the ground war in Afghanistan, inadvertently.  I thought I was going to video clips or something.  Actually, that was done deliberately, but, uh, hey, I'm glad it worked for you.  It's amazing.  So, Steve, how many clips do we have up? 
[00:30:30]  Like, 30?  Uh, Jeff did 30 clips.  Jeff did 30 clips.  There's actually one, which I was just looking at, of, um, Ant and You with the Paint Guns.  Yeah.  Oh.  Going after Joe.  Yeah.  Oof.  Is it good?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some good stuff.  There's some very good stuff.  Did you guys get good video of, uh, uh, Super, uh, uh,  Yeah, Super Lady Patty getting high smash?  I think so.  I think so.  I haven't seen all of them yet, though.  Right.  I'm looking at the clip of Stephen Lynch trying to do his, uh, his set with all his songs,  and there's Hot Liz just, you know, strutting her stuff on the runway, and everyone is completely 
[00:31:00]  ignoring Stephen Lynch.  Then there's a video clip really fast of Lynch doing one of his songs, and someone's just  mopping the floor behind him.  We discussed that yesterday.  Look at this one titled, Someone Threw a Cigarette at Jim Norton.  Hear how he responds.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  I can only imagine.  Nice.  And this isn't radio, so I'm sure there's a lot of cursing going on.  Oh, no.  Click Steve to download the file.  I like that.  Don't you?  What are some of the other clips that you got up there? 
[00:31:30]  I, I honestly, I haven't even looked at them.  Yeah, they just made it to the website, so.  They just got up.  Jeff's been up all night putting these together, so.  Thank you, Jeff, from foundrymusic.com.  He's sobered up.  Brother Joe's sea song has made it.  Ah, sea filly, download that and get accustomed to it.  A lot of video clips of women wowing.  Stephen Lynch's performance.  Jim Norton yelling and screaming at somebody.  Hopefully, Patty, dressed as Supergirl, getting, you know, trounced by a beer will be up there  as well.  I'm trying to download that one.  All right. 
[00:32:00]  People now pounding the site to get the video clips.  Which was kind of stupid.  We should have kind of taken a look ourselves.  And then, you know, pass it along to everybody else.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I called Dorn Days in New during that song, and I didn't speak to Stinky.  I spoke to one of the Philly people, and they said, oh, we're working on it, and they  just hung up.  I told them the vocals weren't coming through.  That sucked.  I'm so bummed, you know?  Yeah.  We were so excited to have Travis singing some of those songs in the studio.  And then I knew there was a problem.  And everyone was like, yes, to me to death.  Go, no, man.  No, it sounds great.  It sounds great. 
[00:32:30]  It sounds great.  It actually got better as the song went along.  Oh, yeah.  It did.  But, you know, I should have checked it first.  All right.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you.  But see, you know, if it starts out like that, I know radio well enough to know that  people are going, all right, well, let's click around and see what else is going on.  Ooh, this is awful.  I'll come back at the end of the song, maybe.  Yeah, no one has patience to wait around to see if it's going to get better.  No.  Joe, what's going on?  You're next on the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The level of their sound seems like it should be yelling, shut up, cabbie, at them. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, really?  Kind of in the background?  Yeah.  That's too bad.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Awesome.  Yeah, awesome.  His level was higher than Travis.  Right.  All right.  Anthony, boobal lanterns is a go.  Yeah, now, game on for boobal lanterns.  Game on.  This is a great Halloween thing.  This is the first annual boobal lantern contest.  And you know what?  It's going to happen in two cities, my friends.  Oh.  Two cities.  Here's the deal.  And, ladies, you've got to listen closely, okay? 
[00:33:30]  Listen up.  We're looking for ladies with breast implants.  We have said on many occasions on this radio show we like the natural boobs.  Who doesn't?  But if we're going to do the boobal lanterns, trust me, we're experts.  It only works with breast implants.  And I don't want the ladies yelling and screaming, you know, you guys only like the implants.  No, it's not about that, okay?  It just works better.  We tested the natural boobs and the implants.  Trust me, it works so much better with the implants.  Bigger the better, the implants, too. 
[00:34:00]  Bigger the better, right.  Those work the best.  We love the natural boobs.  But for this, we need women with implants.  Correct.  The contest is on next Tuesday through Friday.  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  The ladies of the New York area have an open invite to come down to the station when we're broadcasting between 3 and 7 to show up what they got.  We'll take a before picture.  Yeah.  And then the second picture will be a picture of your boobs lit up by flashlights with all the lights out in the house. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  All right?  We will put all the pictures up on a website.  And then our fine listeners from all over the country will vote for their favorite boob-o-lantern.  Do you think if a girl took a black magic marker or a Sharpie and drew a little jack-o-lantern face on the front of her boob in black and then lit it up, you would see the actual jack-o-lantern face?  That might be something a girl would want to try.  You know what?  That's a great idea.  And I think that might put them over the top.  Or they just could carve a little face.  Carve a little face.  On their boob. 
[00:35:00]  Whatever works.  All right?  We're going to have another great prize.  We have upped the ante with our prizes lately.  So, trust me, it will be a very nice prize for the winner of the boob-o-lantern contest.  All right?  So, ladies, once again, for New York, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, open invite.  You don't even have to call and say you're coming.  Just, you know, come on down and show us what you got.  Right.  All right, guys, tell all the strippers in the strip clubs that this contest is for them if they're looking for a little exposure.  Okay?  Yeah, girls, if you're strippers in various clubs, you want to come down, we'll definitely let you plug where you're going to be. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, hell yeah.  The club you dance at, and you get a little exposure on the radio, and you might win some.  This is where it gets interesting.  So, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday for the New York area ladies, okay?  Nice.  Then Monday and Tuesday, which will be, what, Ben, the 29th and 30th, I think?  Yeah.  We're going to be broadcast.  My voice is still shot.  Let me tell you something quickly without interrupting with the flow of what we're going to be doing.  That club was so smoky, I woke up feeling like I had smoked three packs of cigarettes. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, my voice.  And that's why my throat is screwy, too.  I'm having a tough time with my voice.  It will not come back, and it usually comes back nice.  It's just full of smoke.  I'd rather have the anthrax.  Nice.  All right, so then we're going to be broadcasting for Boston on the 29th and 30th.  We're helping them with their Halloween party.  We'll be live from the WBCN studios.  We're inviting the Boston ladies to come in that Monday and Tuesday to show off their boobs.  We've seen, we used to frequent a lot of the strip clubs up there. 
[00:36:30]  I know there's some really great-looking girls with the big fake boobs.  Right.  It's not just for, you know, strippers, obviously.  Yeah, any other girl that has had implants, come on down.  But here's the deal.  Yes, like Angela said, it has to be breast implants.  Trust me, we've tried it, and it doesn't work unless it's implants.  All right, so once again, really fast.  It's the first annual Boobalander contest.  And next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the New York ladies open invite.  You know how these contests work.  Just show up between 3 and 7 and show us what you got. 
[00:37:00]  We'll take all the pictures, okay?  Okay.  And then the following Monday and Tuesday, the 29th and 30th, we're going to do the same damn thing in Boston.  Yeah.  And then we'll put all the pictures up on the website, and then we'll crown a winner for a great prize.  Okay?  Very cool.  Boob-O-Lantern.  And someone quickly say, what happened to Naughty Nighty?  Don't worry.  We're holding back on the Naughty Nighty contest, because we want to make sure that works like a charm.  That stuff has happened before, too.  We throw things out there, and then months later, they come back.  Right.  I don't know what happens. 
[00:37:30]  So, Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, Bobby, what's up?  Hey, Opie, Bobby Bigrigger here.  Hey, listen, before I call my bookie, where are you heading to this weekend?  I need the name of the town.  Or at least the state.  I'm heading north.  You're heading?  Oh, that's helping.  I'm heading to my second hometown house.  Oh, okay.  Beantown.  Yeah, there you go.  Beantown.  All right.  Now I know where to take the college run for the kids and roll over.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:38:00]  Have a good weekend.  All right, Bobby.  Later.  How about those?  I'm staying away from the Coliseum, because I want the Islanders to continue their winning  ways.  Stay far away.  So I'm going to mess up the Bruins a little bit this weekend.  How about those Yankees, huh?  God damn.  Well, they're on a roll, Anthony.  I like it.  I wouldn't say a word.  I like it.  No, don't.  You already spoke your piece about Seattle, about the Mariners.  How you got to respect a team that lose a couple of key players and still get as far  as they have.  I completely agree with that. 
[00:38:30]  That's beautiful.  But, man, taking two like that in Seattle, coming back to the stadium over the weekend.  I'm very excited.  How you doing?  You want me to play a little bit of this?  We're the little Yankees.  How you doing?  Why couldn't the mix on this song be horrendous?  It is.  Yeah.  Hey, Joey Baseballs.  How you doing?  Oh, I'm doing so much better. 
[00:39:00]  How you doing?  Listen, we just got a phone call from Nate Giuliani.  He wants us to do a little something special for the Yankees.  Oh, yeah.  Know what's sad?  That song.  I have to say, and no offense, we like these guys.  We've had them on the show, okay?  Right.  We like to mess with them, all right?  There are radio stations in New York, because obviously the Yankees are doing well, that  are playing this song as a serious song.  Yeah.  Listen to that.  That was nice.  That one hurt.  I feel like Peter Brady right now.  It's time to change. 
[00:39:30]  But they are.  They're playing this.  Yeah, they're playing this as a real song.  Right.  And then they have to come on after it and say how great the song is.  This thing stinks, as Norton would say.  And this is going to go out to all the heroes in New York.  Right.  When do you hear this?  New York!  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yankee!  How you doing?  Awful.  How you doing?  New York!  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:40:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  The pinstripe.  Shut up!  The pinstripe.  Championship.  Operation Yankee Dynasty.  Who's on?  How you doing?  Who knew there was an operation, man?  It's going down in the Bronx again.  In New York City.  Still the greatest city in the world.  In the greatest country in the world.  How you doing?  Ah!  The cockiness of the Yankee fans.  How you doing?  Come through on this stupid song, man.  Don't say it's the cockiness of the Yankees fans.  That's just Carminoch and Joey Baseball. 
[00:40:30]  The Yankee fans, it's called confidence.  In a team.  I hear this crap when I go to the stadium.  The cockiness.  How you doing?  The cockiness that you guys have.  It's unbelievable.  How you doing?  New York.  How you doing?  That's awesome.  Yankee fans.  Are they playing this at the stadium yet?  Yeah?  I don't either.  I know the first one they were.  And it's just ridiculous. 
[00:41:00]  What's with all these Miserabs and the Taliban?  Miserabs.  What you know trying to stop freedom is like trying to stop the Yankees you can't do it.  Are you doing?  That's right.  You can't stop me.  I'm still taking a foretrance.  And I'm still sneaking into the stadium.  How you doing?  Yeah!  Yeah!  This makes the Super Bowl Shuffle sound like a Grammy winner.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, man.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm on my way to pick up some of New York's bravest and New York's finest. 
[00:41:30]  We're going to the game and we're sitting with the bleacher creatures.  How you doing?  You know, New York and the Yankees go hands in hand.  They were down but never out.  Never underestimate the heart of a champion.  How you doing?  New York!  How you doing?  It's cringe, man.  Remember how we used to see one of these guys at the Yankee games and he was always trying  to hand us the CD during the first version? 
[00:42:00]  Give me a sandwich.  Hey, Joe, are you ready for the fourth piece?  Are you ready for the fourth piece?  I'll tell you what I'm ready for.  I'm ready for my man Janusz and V. Bruno.  He can't get somebody on the phone.  He had exactly what did that. 
[00:42:30]  Joe balls, Joe balls, Joe balls.  Yeah!  I mean, they don't even say it right.  How you doing?  Hey, New York, jokes aside, you keep your chin up.  That's right.  Don't forget, we all got a big fight to win.  God bless America.  How you doing?  Oh, they get the serious.  How you doing?  How you doing, Taliban?  How you doing?  No, how you doing?  We ain't messing around now.  How you doing? 
[00:43:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  I curse those guys because you get up in the middle of the night to take that leak.  And what's in your head?  That damn, how you doing?  Oh, you're in there one eye open trying to get to the tan.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Awful.  Jim, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, you're killing me.  Why?  I'm calling from Boston.  I'm a huge Red Sox fan.  And hey, I love the show, but I'm sympathetic towards New York for everything that's been 
[00:43:30]  going on, but I'm not going to let those terrorists change my way of life.  I hate the Yankees.  And ever since you picked Oakland last week, they've been on a roll and it's killing me.  Five and O.  Ever since I said the Yankees were going to lose, they're five and O and most of those  wins on the road.  I know.  More of them on the road.  I mean, we already had one, Chris, here in Boston.  How come you had to bring another one to us?  That's hilarious.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  You know, this would be a good place to play the Earl Weaver thing. 
[00:44:00]  We get a lot of requests for this thing.  Richie's saying he's renouncing his status as an Italian-American.  There we go with Richie.  Hey, Richie.  What's up, fellas?  I've got something to say about these guys.  Yeah.  Hair gelling, pasta eating, espresso sipping, Sergio Tacchini sweatsuit wearing, LSC driving,  Godfather horn beeping, gold chain wearing, Saturday Night Fever listening, hair on their  back, cannoli sucking, both cheeks kissing, ass Fs.  And I'm no longer Italian.  He made a good point there. 
[00:44:30]  Being an Italian, you listen to that and just go like, oh my God.  You might as well just have the black guys going, yeah, Rasmus, you want some watermelon?  I mean, it's that stereotypical, you know?  Have a couple of rabbis going, I dropped a penny.  Let me get my penny.  It's just every stereotype rolled into stereotypes.  Stereotypes, always funny.  Always funny. 
[00:45:00]  How many people are willing to admit stereotyping is funny?  It is funny.  Especially when the mainstream media gets a hold of you and they ask those questions in  the interviews.  Yeah.  I love stereotyping.  You know, people might take what you say and use that.  Well, people talk like that every day.  I want to bring up something I saw on the news.  You see the outcry and the Navy had to apologize because some guy wrote on one of the bombs,  hijack this, fags, on a bomb. 
[00:45:30]  And the Navy had to apologize for the slur, fags, written on a bomb.  Or hijack.  The whole thought that the Navy has to apologize for words written on a bomb.  The priorities are a little wacky there.  That's why, you know, one reason why this country is in trouble.  Yeah.  We're getting too politically correct.  We don't want to...  We're politically correct in our wars.  Yeah.  We don't want to offend people.  In the old days, man, someone effed with us. 
[00:46:00]  We took care of business.  I agree with what we're doing.  We didn't worry about who we were hurting in the process.  We took care of business and made sure freedom continued.  I agree.  Now we're changing the name of the war.  We can't write fags on the bomb.  I agree with what we're doing 100%.  I love the fact that we're dropping bombs.  But in the scheme of things, as a human being, don't you think a bomb being dropped is more offensive than the words written on it? 
[00:46:30]  You know what I mean?  And don't get me wrong.  I love the word, bomb the crap out of them.  But if you're looking at it from an what offends point of view, killing people is always an offensive thing when you're dropping bombs on people.  But the writing on the bomb is what upsets people.  That's what I just...  I was dumbfounded when I saw that.  And just because you call someone a fag doesn't mean they suck, uh...  Right.  Right.  It's just, hey, faggot.  You know, you want to hijack a plane and crash into a building?  Faggot. 
[00:47:00]  Here, now you're going to get some bombs.  All right.  Enjoy.  All right.  Right on.  So there you have it.  I hope the ladies show up for the Boobalander contest.  Yeah.  You know, we have a pair of tickets to the Yankees.  How you doing?  Pair of tickets to the Yankees.  How you doing?  How you doing?  We have a pair of tickets for tomorrow's game, Anthony.  Carl Minutes got his junk in my balloon.  Not how you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:47:30]  Courtesy of Budweiser, the king of beers in Major League Baseball.  The king of beers.  How you doing?  The winner also receives a Yankee prize pack from Budweiser, which includes a jacket, two sweatshirts, and two T-shirts.  How are we going to get these tickets away?  You obviously got to pick them up today.  I'm shooting my goo.  How you doing?  How are we going to give those away?  How you doing?  We're going to have to figure it out as we take a break.  How you doing?  When we come back, we'll figure out how to give away the Yankee tickets.  People got pissed when we sent Earl out on the street. 
[00:48:00]  Anytime Earl's involved.  Well, no, I guess because they're like, oh, man, it was obvious someone close to the station was going to wait.  Earl wasn't going to walk too far.  Right.  He wasn't going to walk.  What did he get them outside next to Opera Man out by the stairs?  So we got to figure out something.  Okay.  But he got to pick them up before seven because we're going home for the weekend and it's for tomorrow's game.  So it's got to kind of be close.  Right.  All right.  We'll do some brainstorming.  As we go to break, don't go to local programming yet.  We still have a little bit to play here. 
[00:48:30]  Don't go to your country tunes in San Francisco.  Give us another two minutes here.  Then he can play the latest from, does anyone even know a country artist?  Travis Trick.  I would go with Stinky.  If I had to.  That's old school.  That's like old school.  That's like saying run DMC if you're talking about hip hop.  No, saying the Sugar Hill Gang.  I'm serious.  Like a current country artist.  Do you know well?  Well, everyone knows Garth Brooks. 
[00:49:00]  Well, current.  Like a new artist in the last five years.  I don't know.  None of us could even mention it.  Faith Hill.  Nah.  That's a crossover artist.  Yeah.  That's a crossover.  She's crossing over it.  How you doing?  She's so effing hot.  Yeah.  Faith Hill, how you doing?  Isn't Tug McGraw's son fouling Faith Hill, right?  Really?  They're married and all that?  There you go.  A little kid's you. 
[00:49:30]  A tidbit of knowledge.  A little country knowledge.  How you doing?  So we can help out our San Francisco situation.  Right.  Country music, always awful.  Yeah.  Here's the Earl Weaver show.  We get a lot of requests for this damn thing.  Check it out.  The manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager,  the Orioles, Earl Weaver.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merriman, wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed. 
[00:50:00]  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You can get some goddamn little fleas on a f***ing basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big t***suckers that can hit the f***ing ball out of the ballpark and you can't make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  So, Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time. 
[00:50:30]  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing ass for eight innings and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan,  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in the f***ing night.  So, if this f***er's mind his own business and let me manage the f***ing team, we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, but let's get to something else. 
[00:51:00]  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lane's coming from,  rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out of the f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street,  she might get a f*** stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go f*** yourself in the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball f***ing Network.  Are you bastards ready to rock? 
[00:51:30]  Opie and Anthony.  When you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for shock factor?  Oh my God!  Ah, Anthony, this Sunday, the WWF presents No Mercy Live on Pay-Per-View.  Yeah, the WWF Championship on the line.  Stone Cold Steve Austin defends his title against both Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle  and Mr. Pay-Per-View Rob Van Dam in a triple threat match. 
[00:52:00]  Is Kurt going to regain the title?  Hmm?  Will RVD seize his first ever opportunity to become the WWF champion?  It's Stone Cold Steve Austin's, uh...  What?  It's Stone Cold Steve Austin's to lose.  That's right.  That's right.  It's his title to lose.  Plus, No Mercy marks the return of Vince McMahon in Pay-Per-View.  This Sunday, will he be a factor?  Of course he will.  Order No Mercy and find out.  Also, it's the Battle of the Babes when the beautiful Tori Wilson takes on the ever-so-sexy 
[00:52:30]  Stacey Keebler in the first ever lingerie match.  Two totally gorgeous divas going at it wearing almost nothing.  Order No Mercy live this Sunday, 8 p.m. 7 Central.  Presented by Subway.  Call your local Pay-Per-View provided to order.  Uh, yeah, it's No Mercy live this Sunday.  1027.  WNEW.  POD.  Alive.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oi!  It's Friday. 
[00:53:00]  Phones are lit.  Very good.  Oh, by the way, Joe Perry checking in today.  He is.  Our old friend.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  Nice.  He's nice.  Finally starting to get some, uh, rock stars on this radio show.  Well, I guess that's what happens when you, uh, when you go national.  They can't deny you anymore.  The little, uh, the little fidgets from the various little rock stations can't keep them 
[00:53:30]  all, uh, away from us, O.P.  I told you, Steve, in the end, O.P. and Anthony always win.  Accept it.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Steve, Steve Kingston.  Look at this little wanker.  There's many times he told me, you know, you need to go on that f***ing show.  Over, over your hand.  But I said, I'm going to go to this interview.  You should talk to the f***ing guys because you're a fidget.  You're a little fidget. 
[00:54:00]  You know, when I get off of a helicopter, I've got to bend down a little bit, like people  do.  If I have a crumb and a fish midget, he doesn't even have to bend down off of the helicopter.  It's so funny because the company tries to tell us how we're one big happy family.  Yeah.  And there are people, uh, within this company that, you know, don't want us to succeed.  Of course not.  It's not in their best interest.  It's that corporate radio, they call it.  Right. 
[00:54:30]  We've wanted ours on, uh, our show since the first day we started up here in New York.  You always win in the end.  Finally, we're on 15 stations and the record labels are taking notice.  Yeah.  And one guy can't hold that back anymore, thank God.  And when the people come on the show and they have a good time and have some fun, you know,  they remember it.  Hell yeah.  Can't hold it back.  All right.  Uh, by the way, Joe Perry's going to be talking about, uh, United We Stand, the concert that's  going on in Washington Sunday at RFK Stadium.  Yeah.  Also appearing on the bill with Aerosmith. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  Guess which band doesn't belong.  Okay.  You have Aerosmith.  Yeah.  You have Michael Jackson.  You have NSYNC.  P. Diddy.  Mariah Carey.  And the Backstreet Boys.  How about Aerosmith?  Doesn't belong on that bill.  Oh, man.  We'll have to ask him about that.  Well, you know something?  They've been pretty poppy, them guys.  You know?  I think they're falling into that very popular area of music. 
[00:55:30]  Not to that extent.  There's poppy and then there's poppy.  Right.  Not to that extent.  But, in my opinion, Aerosmith still rocks.  And the new album is not bad at all.  Just push play.  Yeah.  It's not like they're pure drug-driven rock guys anymore, though.  You know what I mean?  Ben is looking at the list.  The rest of the list.  Who else is on the bill?  Aaron Carter.  Al Green.  What?  Wait a minute.  Aaron Carter?  Yeah.  Isn't he the little kid?  Yeah.  Al Green.  America.  The Backstreet Boys. 
[00:56:00]  Bette Midler.  Carol King.  Wait.  The Backstreet Boys and NSYNC on one stage?  Stop it.  Well, it's for a good cause, Ian.  Maybe there'll be a little fight backstage.  Woo!  Bette Midler.  Bette Midler.  Carol King.  Destiny's Child.  Faith Evans.  The Goo Goo Dolls.  Oof.  I remember the Goo Goo Dolls when they were a punk band.  From my buff.  What happened to them?  Huey Lewis in the news.  Ah!  It's hip to be square.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  I feel good himself. 
[00:56:30]  James Brown.  James Brown.  Mariah Carey.  Michael Jackson.  NSYNC.  P. Diddy.  Pink.  Ricky Martin.  Oof.  Rod Stewart.  Howdy.  I wonder if that chick from Cheerleaders is heading down to RFK Stadium to try to get  laid.  There you go.  Train.  An usher.  Oh.  Good God.  Hey, it's for a good cause.  What the hell?  Well, of course.  Anthony, we've got to give away these Yankee tickets.  How are we going to do this?  How are you doing? 
[00:57:00]  Well, here's the deal.  Yeah.  Budweiser gave us these tickets last minute.  Mm-hmm.  We have to give them away before we get it off the air.  Yeah.  So we've got to do something with the people that are pretty close to the station.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, because somebody from, like, out on Long Island or something isn't going to be, you  know, making the trip out here.  Someone way in Jersey or, you know, the Yankee, Westchester, you know.  It's not like you could just get here by five or whatever.  Pennsylvania.  Mm-hmm.  So, you know, bear with us. 
[00:57:30]  I thank Budweiser for giving us these tickets, but maybe next time, you know, give us a couple  days so we can do something really, really good for the tickets.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We have tickets for tomorrow night's game.  No, it's actually games four and five, Sunday and Monday.  Sunday and Monday.  Okay.  Incorrect, earlier.  Sunday and Monday's games at the stadium, Anthony.  So you could watch the sweep.  So we got a pair of tickets for Sunday's game and a pair of tickets for Monday's game.  Okay.  All right.  What if there isn't a game five? 
[00:58:00]  Exactly.  Then someone's going to be really pissed off.  Well, hey, it's the thought.  Uh, uh, maybe there will be.  You never know.  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  I'm not putting it past Seattle to take one of these goddamn games.  You know what I mean?  They need a little rest.  So I'm definitely thinking this one's going to go in five.  This is what we're going to do.  Mm-hmm.  And I don't want to hear anyone bitching because I think it's the right thing to do. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  Okay.  We have a pair of tickets to the first cop that comes down and says hi to us today.  The first cop.  You've got to prove you're a cop.  You've got to prove you're a New York City cop.  There you go.  Okay?  I like that.  That'll take care of Sunday's game.  For Monday's game.  The first fire guy.  All right.  First fireman to come down and say hi to us and prove that he's a fireman.  We'll get, uh, you know, the tickets for game five.  Monday's game.  That works.  No bitching from anyone.  I think this is the right thing to do on, you know, on short notice. 
[00:59:00]  Okay?  What scumbag is going to bitch about that?  You guys suck.  I deserve the tickets.  First cop to come down.  First fireman to come down.  We got Yankee tickets for you guys.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  Contest is on.  It's on right now.  And I want to thank, uh, Budweiser for getting us the tickets.  Okay?  Jesus.  Security downstairs is going to allow the, uh, the cops up.  Wait.  Fireman.  JJ.  Jimmy Walker will let him up.  There is a security guy downstairs. 
[00:59:30]  The spitting image of Jimmy JJ Walker from good times.  You know what happened though?  It's so funny.  You know what happened?  Someone obviously told him.  No.  Because he got a haircut to make sure he doesn't look as much like Jimmy Walker now.  And he gives me a stare.  And I'm like, oh, great.  Give him the floppy Jimmy Walker hat.  I have to check your ID to make sure you're not bringing up dynamite.  Very good.  But he got a haircut.  Did he?  Because at some point, I think Jimmy Walker now goes around with a shaved head. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, he does.  Remember when we called Jimmy Walker?  He had a show in Nebraska, I think it was, a radio show.  I got those tapes somewhere.  Oh, if you could dig up one of those.  We called up Jimmy JJ Walker.  He was doing his show.  For some reason, someone gave him a radio show.  And he was doing political talk.  And we would call him up.  We would listen in on the Internet.  And he'd get into all these really serious political discussions with people.  But it's goddamn JJ.  JJ Walker. 
[01:00:30]  So we would call him up and start off asking him serious questions.  Well, you've got to tell the folks that JJ doesn't like talking about good times whatsoever.  No, especially with this.  He wanted to change his image.  He was going to be a political talk show host.  Right.  So our whole goal was to, you know, piss him off and talk about good times and throw him off.  Yeah, we would start out with the serious question about the subject that he was talking about.  We did this all day when we were supposed to do our own radio show.  We were just pounding him.  Yeah.  So we'll find that tape.  We'll play it before 7 o'clock today. 
[01:01:00]  Keith the cop, what's going on?  Gentlemen, I'm going to try and maintain my composure.  Okay.  But I have an FU today.  Uh-huh.  This is an FU to everybody that's calling the police to open their mail.  Holy Jesus.  What?  I don't put this past anyone.  I can't take it anymore.  I'm trying to maintain my composure 10 to 12 times a day.  Open my mail, please.  I have read this in the paper.  Not only this, but other things.  You people are morons. 
[01:01:30]  And I have the king or queen moron yesterday.  Yeah.  We get a call.  Comes over.  Problem with the mail.  You know, strange substance.  Uh-huh.  We get there.  This lady ate her pizza on top of the mail.  Got up, threw the pizza away, the bag and everything.  Yeah.  Came back, saw white stuff on the mail, and called the police.  It was Parmesan cheese. 
[01:02:00]  Parmesan.  My partner took his finger.  He put it.  He smelt it.  He licked it.  Parmesan cheese.  And it took you guys away from doing other stuff.  I don't get it.  God damn.  People are so friggin' stupid.  They're actually appealing to the public to say, look, we understand everyone's freaking out about this anthrax scare.  Especially here in New York.  Especially in New York.  But it doesn't mean that every instance where you see powder, you have to call the police. 
[01:02:30]  Because it ties up so many resources when you call in on this anthrax thing.  Use some common sense.  If you ate pizza on your mail, and now you're seeing a cheese-like substance on it, it's probably cheese.  No one has gotten anthrax sent to private addresses.  It's all been corporate, mostly news organizations, that have gotten these letters.  People now, I swear to God, are looking at sand on a bus floor. 
[01:03:00]  A bus was stopped, and police had to be brought on board because sand was in the aisle.  Oh, in someone's shoes.  Well, her reasoning was that her husband's friend's sister knew somebody that worked at, like, NBC or something like that.  Oh, brother.  So, you know, they were friends with somebody, and they thought maybe, you know, she evacuated her kids, the babysitter, everybody.  People are losing their minds with this anthrax thing.  Losing their minds.  So, we have to go check out another one right now, but I needed to just get that. 
[01:03:30]  How many have you had to check out personally, Keith?  Yesterday, we did about a dozen.  A dozen false alarms.  And this is one cop right here.  So, today, this is only our second one.  Have you had to be tested?  I was tested earlier in the week.  And what was that because of?  Because we had a couple piles of something on the ground, and we had to go get tested.  You didn't know what it was, though?  No, we had no idea.  Sometimes the testing takes a little long.  Yeah, this city's insane. 
[01:04:00]  Right after the Twin Tower thing, the bomb threats that were coming into the police stations were off the chart.  Right, Keith?  It was just crazy.  They were getting like 10 or, well, I don't know how many you get on a regular day, but the numbers were through the roof.  Everyone was calling in, you know, fake bomb threats.  Okay, so I'm sure it's not our listeners, but I'm just asking the people out there,  if you're going to eat your pizza, please, get rid of the mail.  Don't do it on the mail. 
[01:04:30]  Put the mail aside.  All right.  Okay, that's all.  Gentlemen, have a good day.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Lenny, another cop.  Lenny!  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, how are you, man?  Let's see if I can get through this or I'm messing this one up.  Go ahead.  The other day, this lady called us to a house for a package that she didn't recognize.  She didn't know where it came from.  She was like 80 years old.  Her husband had passed away fairly recently.  Lucky him.  They called the case in and the whole nine yards, speak to the detectives. 
[01:05:00]  The detective is livid that this type of stuff is going on.  And, you know, that this lady has some notion that somebody would send her anthrax.  So, um...  Yeah, 80-year-old woman.  Yeah.  That's a target.  Right.  So, uh...  So, they check.  So, they call the boss to the scene.  He speaks to the lady.  The detective says, why don't you ask her to open it?  This went on.  This case was called in.  And also, all of the work had gone forth thus far, which is kind of time-consuming. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, a lot of resources tied up.  Kind of like this phone call.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll wrap it up real quick.  I'm kidding, Lenny.  Go ahead.  So, the boss says, could you open the package?  She opens the package.  It's an easy pass.  It's an easy pass that her husband had ordered probably, you know, before he passed away.  Oh, so it kind of made the envelope fat and...  Right.  She had no clue.  You know, and just because she didn't recognize it, she thought, oh, somebody must be sending  me anthrax.  Yeah.  So, like, she's that important. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, that an 80-year-old woman now is going to get anthrax at her house.  Right, right.  Right.  But she's got that much time left.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Well, thanks, Lenny.  Ciao.  I know the mailroom at this station has turned completely insane.  I mean, this is hysterical and surreal.  Can we get a picture of that for the website?  Do they mind?  I don't know.  We haven't received mail, I think, all week at this point because...  There's a new policy in place.  There's a new policy.  They're in spacesuits, basically, upstairs.  Yeah.  We have people in the mailroom in spacesuits. 
[01:06:30]  That's the only way to describe it.  Wearing breathing apparatus.  We have no clue who they decided to let open the mail.  We see them.  We don't know who's under the spacesuits.  Right.  They have gas masks.  They're completely covered head and toe.  Yeah.  And they're opening the mail.  And they're opening the mail.  Well, all the wow inquiries for stickers and whatnot, they're sorting through it.  They're opening them up.  Opening up every piece of mail that comes to the radio station.  And they're pretty much in biohazard suits.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Good luck to you.  This is the world we now live in.  It's insane.  You know, I get out of Penn Station every day.  There are army guys all over the damn place.  It's crazy.  It is just weird.  When you go overseas, like when I flew to Athens this summer, you see that type of thing going on.  Yeah.  We were talking about that because that was before September 11th.  You go to Europe.  Anytime you're going overseas, you usually see at the airports and whatnot just armed security guys.  And you're like, wow, it's so cool we can live in a country where that isn't necessary. 
[01:07:30]  And now it's just everywhere.  It's commonplace to see military vehicles on the streets here in New York.  What the hell is that?  What is that about?  Armed guys.  At the train stations and airports.  It's crazy.  All right.  But that's where we live now.  Ben, you didn't have luck with that video clip?  I was kind of taking a peek.  Oh, no, no, no.  I just clicked off it.  It's a clip of Patty getting hit with beer the other night.  But the site's getting pounded.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the site's getting pounded. 
[01:08:00]  They just added 30 clips from the road show from Philly.  Video clips now.  Yesterday, we had the pictures.  Now we got video clips.  And you can see what you missed, man.  You'll feel like you're there.  And you got to go to foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Foundrymusic.com.  There's a link to that website off of opiananthony.com.  We made it easy for you.  But 30 video clips.  It's getting pounded now.  So you might want to try it later on tonight or sometime this weekend.  Oh, I got it up now.  So I'm taking a look at it. 
[01:08:30]  If you want to go to foundrymusic.com and check it out.  Patty coming out in her super lady suit.  We're talking to her.  This is her first journey out onto the catwalk.  She's halfway.  A little further.  Oh, there's the first beer gets her.  She turns right around and walks back.  Everyone's laughing.  More beers follow.  Then we talk her.  We're talking to her a little more.  Bopey pointing out to the podium now.  Directing her to walk back out. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, this was my payback, my friend.  Because people didn't get a good enough look at her.  So we talked her into walking again down the runway.  Here's Patty cautiously walking.  Just gets onto the ramp now.  She's about one quarter of the way down.  Oh, that's getting tilted.  Five beers hit her right in the head.  She comes back now, her eyes stinging from the beer.  Right.  Well, that's not beer we found out yesterday.  A lot of guys admitted it was byproduct from the beer.  So now I'm pointing out.  Now you're pointing.  Telling her we need her out on that walkway all the way to the end to say hi to the crowd. 
[01:09:30]  And we're yelling to the crowd, look, guys, come on.  You know, don't do this, Patty.  You know, be cool to Patty.  And we're winking.  And they all know to kind of hold their fire until she gets further down the ramp.  Right.  So she has to come all the way back a lot further.  So here she goes.  Here she goes for the third time.  Walking down.  All the way down the Miss America runway.  Halfway.  Oh, halfway.  She's just getting pulled up.  Holy ass.  If you download the Patty clip, you've got to wait to the end because that's the money shot, man. 
[01:10:00]  I am dying laughing watching that.  But that's worth the price of admission.  You've got to wait until the end of the clip.  It looks like a wave of beer coming from the audience.  Beautiful.  So that clip and many others on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  There is a link on opieandanthony.com for that.  That's beautiful.  And we found the Jimmy Walker thing.  Oh, we got some of that?  Yeah, we'll play that next and get into other things as well.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot. 
[01:10:30]  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah, it's Friday and it's time for Sam Adams.  Let me get one.  Hold on.  Ah, you know, even warm.  Sam Adams is great.  That's a warm one.  It's not quite as cold as I like them.  That's too bad.  But see, even warm.  It's fantastic.  Because it's the best beer in America.  What a great American beer Sam Adams is.  They have the Oktoberfest out now. 
[01:11:00]  And the original lager that Jim Cook cooked up for so, I'm gurgling over here, a few years back.  And it's just become a favorite across the country.  Sam Adams.  We love it.  We love it.  What a great American beer.  I'm going to kick back this weekend and watch the Yankees emerge victorious over Seattle.  And what am I going to have?  A Sam Adams.  Right.  An ice cold Sam Adams right by my side.  I suggest you do the same thing for playoff parties, whatever you want to do. 
[01:11:30]  You're hanging out with your pals.  Anything.  Sam Adams.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  If you're not in the New York area, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  On the phone, Joe Perry.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  Joe.  How are you?  What's going on, man?  What's up, man?  Everything. 
[01:12:00]  You know, I was just watching TV.  I was just noticing how they have all the news and then they have a Prozac ad.  Oh, really?  They're playing Prozac.  It's probably way up Prozac.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  This is the only way to deal with this crap.  Hey, Joe, you didn't get the anthrax yet, right?  No.  I hear Aerosmith, all the members, have enough older drugs in them to keep the anthrax virus away.  Is that true?  Probably.  It's worked for everything else.  You guys are pickled nice.  I like to think about the days when anthrax was a band. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, right?  And you thought a horrible disease that started with A, it sure wasn't anthrax the first thing that came on the list.  Yeah, that's for sure.  You know what I mean?  You know, Joe, we were in Philly the other day and there's a guy down there, he has a great idea for a radio promotion.  He wants to give out anthrax in the mail and basically just send out anthrax CDs.  I don't know about that.  Maybe not now.  Maybe it's not the time.  This guy is like, I'm telling you, man, it's a great idea.  This is what I want to do on my radio show. 
[01:13:00]  God.  It's insane.  You guys doing all right, man?  We're doing good.  We're out here.  Actually, we're in Des Moines right now, playing tonight, and getting ready to go in and do that big show at RFK Stadium.  Oh, yeah.  And it's going to be a slight burn for us because we're also playing in Indianapolis that night.  Wow.  But we feel it's important for us to show up there and do our bit.  Hell, yeah.  You're appearing with some unusual acts there, Joe, at RFK Stadium. 
[01:13:30]  The list keeps changing.  I still haven't been able to get a handle on who else is there.  All I know is that when people bought tickets, they expected to see Aerosmith, so we're going to be there.  That's cool because I'm looking at the list.  They gave us a one-sheet about the show.  You know, it's called United We Stand, and it's sold out, so I don't even think anyone can get tickets.  It says, also appearing with Aerosmith, Michael Jackson, NSYNC, P. Diddy, Mariah Carey, and the Backstreet Boys.  Yeah.  Well, that list has changed so often, I can't even keep track.  All I know is that we're going in with our hearts and souls, and I think it's really important to do it, so we're there. 
[01:14:00]  How has this affected the tour and everything?  Well, obviously, we canceled and postponed a bunch of dates during the first week.  We were just too torn up inside as everybody and just totally stunned and all those things to play.  And then we realized that it was important for us to get out there again and start giving people a few hours to celebrate and doing our bit and whatever it takes to get us through this. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, that's cool.  I mean, really, it's the only way I think you could pull off Aerosmith being on the same bill as Mariah Carey.  Well, yeah.  It's all for a good cause, man.  Well, that's it.  It's all about music, and it's all about it.  That's why people went and bought tickets without really even knowing who's on the bill.  Right.  Yeah.  God damn.  Have you ever hung with Michael Jackson? 
[01:15:00]  Actually, the closest I ever got to him was at the Hall of Fame this year.  He was sitting at the next table, and we saw him for a second.  He's pretty good.  That's about it.  Other than that, we just watched him from afar like everyone else.  He's pretty freaky.  Yeah, but as a band, I mean, what were you guys saying about Michael Jackson behind his back?  Come on.  He's got to be a freak in real life as well.  Well, you know, I hear stories from people just that have worked with him or come in contact, 
[01:15:30]  and he's pretty like, he's obviously been affected by his life.  I mean, and been a kid, a child star.  I mean, he's so talented.  He's just got so much to offer, and what he does in his private life, it's like, I don't know.  I can't even comment on it.  But I'll tell you, to go around, I mean, he's one of those people that you just cannot go out.  And I can't relate to that.  I mean, I have my own problems.  I mean, I sign a few autographs when I go out to dinner, but it's not a big deal. 
[01:16:00]  You know, I can at least go out and live life, and I just can't imagine what it would be like to live like that.  Yeah, but I think he did it to himself, you know, by trying to hide his face in public and all the surgery and stuff.  He became more of a target.  Yeah, he was kind of hip to have the whole mystique thing around you, and then it kind of bites you in the ass in the end, I think.  Yeah, because we've seen you guys walking around Boston, and you blend in, you know.  You know, you're yourselves, and you look like rock stars, but you're not over the top like he was with this stuff, you know.  Well, I don't know. 
[01:16:30]  I can't.  I mean, I wouldn't trade places with him for anything, you know.  He's, I can't imagine, like I said, to have been, like, idolized as he has been since he was seven years old, you know, and brought up in that family.  I mean, who knows?  I guess so.  Jeez.  But anyway, I guess he's provided a lot of entertainment for people, good or bad.  Good or bad, right.  Where's Steven?  What's he up to today?  I don't know.  I think he's on a plane to Ames.  That's where we're playing tonight.  So we hook up at the show around 5 o'clock and take it from there. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, you seem a little mellow right now.  You're just waking up, Joe.  Actually, I woke up about two hours ago.  Jeez, the life, the friggin' life of a rock star, man.  We stay up late, you know.  Yeah.  What's the first thing you do when you wake up?  I have to have coffee.  Yeah, like all of us.  That's it.  That's the first thing.  It used to be not coffee.  It's usually about three double espressos.  You used to be able to wake up and pick yourself up with some Coke or something. 
[01:17:30]  Well, you know, I don't even think that would work anymore.  I think that there's nothing like Starbucks.  Starbucks coffee better than Coke.  Yeah.  I heard it here from Joe Perry.  You know, I was reading, it was in Stuff Magazine, and actually Steven Tyler was in it.  They were talking about, you know, the most outrageous rock stars of all time.  Yeah.  And like Gigi Allen was on there with some of the things he has done in his career.  He was pretty sick.  Like he wanted to, you know, kill himself on stage, but unfortunately the heroin got him first.  Yeah.  He was the guy that took craps on stage and threw in the audience. 
[01:18:00]  I remember Gigi.  And one of the guys I wish I had in front of me, they were asking him about his Coke habit  and how bad it was.  And he said one time, oh, it was Gary Busey, actually, but it was part of this article.  It was so bad one time that he dropped Coke on his dog's butt and snorted it off his own dog's butt.  That's a pretty low point.  Yeah, that's got to wake you up, something like that happening.  You ever have any of those low moments there, Joe?  No, they're in the book. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They're there.  You know, we all go through that, you know, but...  I heard about the private plane that you used to have to go place to place to find drugs,  sometimes just leave the city you're playing in for a short hop to get drugs.  And then is it true that you actually had a pilot that did a barrel roll in your private plane?  Yes.  Oh, cool.  That's true.  And they, you know, I didn't know that it was illegal at the time. 
[01:19:00]  But they just said, you know, we're really not supposed to be doing this.  And I didn't, you know, register.  And, you know, as I've, you know, over the years I've learned, you know, a lot more about flying.  In fact, I took, you know, I soloed, I took some lessons.  I learned just how illegal it is and how dangerous it is to do that.  And it's, I just look back and go, there's another time God was smiling down on me, you know.  Yeah, it's just one of those moments like, how the hell did I live through that? 
[01:19:30]  Were you guys strapped in or did you just kind of take a ride on the ceiling?  Both.  We did both.  It was part of the experience.  That is so cool.  That's crazy.  You guys had the life going, man.  That's sick.  And you're still in it.  Hey, Joe, I got to tell you, we were at the River Rave this year in Boston.  Yeah.  You guys just, you rocked, man.  There was a lot of young bands around and you showed them what it was all about.  Well, it's great to be able to play on a bill like that and still be accepted and, you know,  people acknowledge that, you know, especially when we can turn around and do a show like with Britney Spears and NSYNC. 
[01:20:00]  And, you know, on the one hand, I'm in the studio with, you know, working on Mick Jagger's record.  And then the next week, I'm out in the desert with Nelly working on a video.  It's just I couldn't ask for more.  Yeah, you're on Mick Jagger's latest CD, man.  Yeah.  Solo effort.  So you guys got to sit back and think, how the hell did we do this?  You know, there's so many bands that have been around for a while, but don't still have the popularity you guys got. 
[01:20:30]  I know it had to have gone through your head and go, how come so many others have just dropped to the wayside and we're still around?  Well, I think a big part of it is just what you said, you know.  It's like you look at some of these acts, you know, and we're not afraid to go in and stand toe-to-toe with them.  You know, I think it's all part of it.  It's all music and the fans like what they like and they're the ones that tell us what to do.  And, I mean, that sounds like a cliche, but that's what it's all about. 
[01:21:00]  And, you know, when you, like, say we did something like the Super Bowl and the guys in NSYNC are there and they're all pro and they put on a good show and they do what they do and the fans like them.  And there we are standing next to them.  So it all works out.  We goofed on that pretty good, Joe.  We got you guys on stage with NSYNC and Britney Spears, but you made it work.  Well, that was all part of it.  We keep our ears and eyes open all the time and you just got to keep trying new things. 
[01:21:30]  You guys know, you're from Boston.  You've kind of, you probably get one more level of gossip than the rest of the world gets.  That's true.  That's true.  Hey, how hot is Britney Spears in person?  Well, you know, she's a pro and she's, you know, I've met her a few times and she's a great kid, you know.  She's a kid, kid.  But that's it, you know.  I mean, she's like, she's as old as some of my kids.  Right, right.  You guys still, too.  I saw you at Jones Beach when you were here in New York and you still got the balls. 
[01:22:00]  Steven hasn't lost a thing vocally.  And I think that's contributed to how long you guys have been around, too.  You haven't lost anything.  It's such a disappointment when you see a band that was a favorite years ago and you see them recently and it's just a big disappointment because it's just not there musically and vocally and on the stage.  But I got to say, you know, I'm kissing your ass a little here, Joe.  But the band still rocks. 
[01:22:30]  Well, thanks.  It sounds great.  It's, I mean, I still love music.  I still love loud electric cars.  So that's, to me, it's no surprise.  But Steven, I think his voice is stronger than it's ever been.  And that's just, that's just the freak of nature, I'll tell you.  It really is because you sit there and watch him and go, there's no way this guy who's been in this business this long can still hit that note.  What the hell is he doing?  Yeah, have you heard Robert Plant lately?  I know. 
[01:23:00]  That's, well, that's a prime example of somebody, you know, who didn't love Led Zeppelin.  And then, you know, years go on and you just, I don't know if it's luck or what.  It couldn't have been good health habits.  Well, no.  You know, I mean, like an easy night for him is, he'll leave the cigar bar at 2 in the morning instead of staying until 4.  So he's got some formula going on.  I don't know what it is, but it works.  Yes, it works, man.  Great.  Hey, Joe, I got to say, Ann and I have been doing radio a long time now.  We're up to about 7 or 8 years.  And one of our highlights is when you guys, the whole band hanging out with us in Boston, just playing records. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  I'll never forget that.  Yeah, they brought their private collections and just was playing and talking about the artists.  Jamming muddy waters and all sorts of fun stuff.  That was great.  If you guys are, you know, get to New York soon, you've got to stop by and hang with us because we love you guys.  Well, we'll hook up.  We are doing a show there at Madison Square Garden coming up in the next month, I think.  And we'll see you guys.  You know, it's great.  You guys are really happy to see the success you guys are having.  And I was just reading the list of all the places you go out to, and it's great. 
[01:24:00]  Can you believe we're now on in 15 cities?  That's awesome.  We first met when we were in Boston and did the mayor's prank.  And then you guys called us when we first started in New York going, what the F did you guys do?  You killed Menino.  You were like an older brother going, guys, what the F, man?  You're going to wreck your whole career.  I mean, Aerosmith's giving us the money.  Yeah, Aerosmith's going to tell us how not to F up.  Right.  Well, you guys set your own standards, you know, and, you know, you learn as you go. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's for sure.  So what's the vibe in New York?  Is everybody bearing up or what?  It's a little freaky.  We're trying to move on just like you said, but it's constantly, it's a constant reminder just being here.  You know, I think anywhere else in the country, aside from maybe Washington, you can walk around and for a little bit put it out of your head.  But when you're in New York, New York City here, just being here is a constant reminder.  There's a cop on every corner now.  The subways have a lot of Army guys, Penn Station, a lot of Army guys. 
[01:25:00]  No one's opening mail anymore.  We got two people in biohazard suits, basically, in the mail room opening up our mail with gas masks.  We don't even know who they are.  They're people we know.  We've seen them around.  We don't know who's under the suits because it's kind of weird.  It's just very strange.  Well, you know, the first thing I think that's important for people to realize is that for the rest of the world or the rest of the people in our country is that it isn't just a TV thing.  I mean, there are there are people that I know from New Hampshire that have never been to New York. 
[01:25:30]  So it's really easy to underplay what what happened because we're so used to seeing stuff on TV.  It's distant, yeah.  You know, when I had a chance to go down to the Pentagon about a week and a half after it happened, I took my family down there and my kids and my wife, you know, Billy and my kids.  Because I thought it was important for them to see it as Americans, to see that it's real and it's happening.  And that's why we're going through what we're going through.  It isn't just something that's happening on TV.  For so many years living in this country, all the sick stuff we've seen has been overseas and you get it on the TV and the distance takes away from the emotion of it and the reality of it. 
[01:26:00]  So that's why us here in New York, it's a reminder you're here.  You know, my commute home every night, I look where those towers used to be.  Right.  And see the lights of the workers there glowing through the rest of the buildings.  And that's something that unless you're here, you really can't get from television.  Right.  Well, you know, you can put it in perspective what is happening on TV, which a lot of America can't. 
[01:26:30]  And that's why I would encourage Americans to, if they can, make the pilgrimage to New York and see what's going on in Washington and make it real because it is real.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  You ever go on that Aerosmith roller coaster down there at Universal Studios?  Actually, I've been on it about 47 times.  That's some scary stuff, huh?  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  Why?  I push it out. 
[01:27:00]  Why?  Because I don't like roller coasters.  Isn't it just a roller coaster?  No, it's like inside.  It's dark and there's loops and stuff.  I don't like that.  Is it kind of like an updated Space Mountain?  Yeah.  You're like, I'll go on Space Mountain because I know I'm not going to be turned upside down and stuff.  Yeah.  But, you know, that one looked a little sick.  But you've been on it a lot of times.  The kids like it and stuff.  Well, they do.  My nine-year-old, he'll go on it about once a trip just to try it.  And my 15-year-old loves it.  He goes, you know, he's ridden on it about 29 times. 
[01:27:30]  I was curious to know, is there anyone in the band that wouldn't go on it?  No, everybody.  Everyone went on it?  Everybody's too into that.  All right.  I got to go on it.  You ever think there'd be a roller coaster named after your band, man?  No.  Certainly not.  But the toughest thing to swallow was that they put a Stratocaster up there instead of a Loz Paul.  I know.  Yeah.  But it was done before we were even asked.  So it was, I mean, not to take away anything from Fenders, but I love them.  But, you know, I think that I have to hold a Loz Paul a little closer to my heart. 
[01:28:00]  It's very cool.  Are you guys going to have, like, a pinball machine come out or cereal or a coffin like Kiss?  We had the video game a couple of years ago, but I don't know.  I think it's a different time.  There are so many other things.  Joe, be careful, all right?  Yeah.  The Kiss stuff is getting out of hand.  Well, they've always been like that.  I know, but they've taken to, now you can get the Kiss coffin.  You can be buried in the Kiss coffin.  Right.  I know.  Well, you know, it used to be a lunchbox, right? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  It all started with a lunchbox.  Very cool.  All right, Joe, we're going to let you go.  We know you have a show and all that.  Have fun in Washington on Sunday.  All right.  We'll be there.  Tell the guys we said hi, man.  It's great to see you guys represent Boston and Worcester and the whole area and be out there.  Your accents sound like home to me.  Cool, bro.  Well, next time you're in New York, stop by and say hi.  All right, we will.  All right, thank you, Joe.  We'll see you.  All right, there he goes.  Joe Perry from Aerosmith.  Very cool.  Playing in Boston on the 4th of November. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Playing in Philly on November 8th.  Playing in the city of New York on the 12th of November.  And New Jersey on the 15th of November.  Joe Perry sounds like Brian Regan.  He can't speak badly about anybody.  Well, you know.  We knew we weren't getting anything out on that.  Good guy.  But hey, why don't we play the latest single from Just Push Play?  We could do that.  Record companies, are you listening?  This is for 15 cities.  15 cities.  15 cities get exposure now. 
[01:29:30]  Don't worry about what you hear from a little midget that might be a little angry when people come on our show.  The latest song from Just Push Play.  This is Aerosmith.  Sunshine on the Opie and Anthony show.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:30:00]  Disturbed down with the sickness.  If you're in the New York area, give us a call, man.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277.  For wow.  Including Cleveland today, Anthony.  Yes, Cleveland.  Seems like we got a little O&A Army building in Cleveland.  It's good to see.  I like it.  Chicago, nothing happening. 
[01:30:30]  Nothing.  They might as well turn off our radio show.  You know what I call Chicago right now?  Chicago.  We're on, I don't know, 9 to 1.  The ratings absolutely blow to the point that the company could save money by just,  running dead air and turn off the radio station and save money on the electricity.  Bastards.  Come on.  I'm surprised because they're so motivated to have us in Chicago.  They call us every day with ideas and there's support there. 
[01:31:00]  You could just tell that they're promoting us like crazy when we're not on the air.  Yeah.  Just like Boston and Philly and New York does.  Oh, my God.  Sometimes I get the PD of the Chicago station mixed up with Tim Sabian  because they're just equally as passionate about this program.  Quite frankly, they call so many times, I get pissed off.  Like, oh, not again.  Like, oh, come on.  Another call from Chicago.  Come on.  Let's just put it this way.  I don't even know who the program director is of the station we're on in Chicago.  Thanks for your support, Dick. 
[01:31:30]  Who?  Hey, Philly.  Join the fun, Philly.  Downtown bus terminal in Philly evacuated after a station employee found an unclaimed suitcase  containing C4 explosives and 1,000 feet of blasting cord.  There you go.  No detonator in it or anything, but it's enough, about a third of a pound of C4 explosives,  enough to level the station.  So, Philly, join the fun.  Join the fun of being terrified as a city. 
[01:32:00]  Join the fun in hijinks.  That is terrorism.  But, ha-ha, we have anthrax.  Jeez, man.  But good news, you can iron your mail now.  I'm reading this.  People say you can iron your mail.  Well, let me go to Kat.  Kat, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, if I cut out, it's not my phone.  It's my voice, okay?  All right.  Listen, there's an article in today's Daily News.  Yes, there is.  Where the Soviet germ warfare scientist, who now is on our side, says all you need to 
[01:32:30]  do is iron your mail with a steam iron and moist fabric, and it'll kill any spores in  the envelope.  All right.  He said this in front of Congress.  Well, where's time to iron their mail?  Well, I mean, given the choice of anthrax or a little bit of ironing.  Well, Kat, let me explain something to you.  I truly believe more people will die in the ensuing fires from them ironing their mail than  ever would have died from anthrax by ironing your mail.  You know what?  The suspicious packages everyone talks about are those little, like, lumps of something 
[01:33:00]  in the envelope.  Right.  Usually, you would probably be ironing something that will explode or melt or catch on fire  and kill you.  All right.  Well, here's another bit that might help.  All these hypochondriacs are going to the doctor to get tested for anthrax because they're  like, oh, I'm going to go get swabbed.  It's not a little cotton swab.  It's a metal loop that goes up into the nasal cavity, and they have to take a little chunk  of flesh to test.  Hey, stop it.  Stop it. 
[01:33:30]  Stop it.  I'm sorry, Opie.  Stop it.  So that may cut down on some of the waiting time in the emergency rooms.  Keith, the cop, had this done.  He said it's a big, giant cotton swab.  No.  And they stuck it far up his nose.  Kat, I believe you might be spreading some type of rumor.  Me?  Yeah.  I don't think they have to biopsy your nose.  No, no, no.  I'll find it.  I'll send you the link.  They do take a swab from your nose.  I don't know about cutting flesh.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not.  It's not a big hunk.  It's a little, it's a metal loop, and they, like, take a deep scrape. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  And make sure you don't take a crap on the 28th, because the alligators are going to get  you.  Right.  Kat is spreading.  Opie, you sound really husky today.  I've been husky for, like, two days.  I sound hot.  Anyway, thanks, guys.  Thank you, Kat.  Bye.  Kat is spreading rumor thracks, we call it.  All right.  Iron your mail, people.  How many people are just going to blow up in their houses and catch on fire, melt important  stuff?  There, you just melted your Visa card, you idiot. 
[01:34:30]  Let's just bring our mail to the dry cleaners.  Yeah.  Just put it in the dryer.  I hear if you put your mail in the dryer with five dryer sheets, this is the panic that  has hit New York City.  We've got another cop on the line.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Owen?  All right, man.  I went to the operations unit.  I work at one police plaza, and I had to go to the operations unit the other night.  Yeah.  I think it was Saturday night.  They had 90 suspicious packages they were working at the same time at one time.  90 at one time.  That's great. 
[01:35:00]  And what was the outcome of all 90 packages?  Nonsense.  Nothing, right?  All of them, yeah.  Yeah, all right.  And, you know, on an average day, you know, maybe you get six or eight, you know, suspicious  packages, 90 at one time.  And they're like eight o'clock at night.  People got to do a little of the policing on their own and a little of the sorting out  on their own.  If they feel it's really a threat.  If you open a suspicious package, someone you don't know with something in there, then  fine.  You know, like they said, leave it alone. 
[01:35:30]  Don't touch it.  But if you get a free sample of laundry detergent and there's powder in the pots, it's laundry  detergent.  You know what I mean?  You might as well talk to a wall, though, man.  I know.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  We're probably, a couple of years ago, they would have been snorting it.  We're paranoid by nature.  We're hypochondriacs by nature.  So this is perfect.  Everyone is completely freaked.  Put your mail in toaster ovens and just plain toasters.  Like a Pop-Tot.  Right.  Hello.  All right.  Hey, thanks, Mike.  All right, boys.  Be good.  Hang in there, man.  It's tough times for you guys. 
[01:36:00]  Thanks, bro.  All right.  Unbelievable.  We got a lot of cops outside the studio.  We got to let them in.  Yeah, let's bring them in, man.  If you're just tuning in, we had tickets to give away to the Yankee game, game four and  game five.  We got these tickets last minute from Budweiser.  Yes.  So we told everyone to be cool and we were going to give them away this way.  Basically, we asked for the first cop to come down here, NYPD, and the first fireman  to come down here.  And we would give the tickets to those guys.  We have about out of...  Oh. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Not as many cops as there were out there.  Yeah.  Huh?  A few had to leave.  A few had to leave.  We got four.  Yeah, they're kind of busy.  Probably went on an anthrax call.  Jesus, guys.  You having a tough time with the old anthrax bull?  Yeah.  Lift that mic up for them, will you?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's bogus call after bogus call.  Yeah, kind of got you running around, right?  Oh.  Jeez.  You guys are in the subway a lot, right?  Yep.  And people report suspicious stuff in the subway.  It's the New York City subway system.  The entire subway system is suspicious. 
[01:37:00]  Everything is suspicious.  I detected a urine-like smell.  Please come down.  I mean, if it wasn't urine smelling, you'd be suspicious.  Right.  Hell yeah.  If I was on a clean train, I would be calling you guys.  What the hell is going on here?  Oh, my God.  There must have been something on here.  It's cleaned up.  Right.  There you go.  There's got to be some kind of odorless anthrax.  So, are you guys Yankee fans?  Sure.  Looking to see the Yankees go the whole way, right?  Absolutely.  It's the best time of year.  There you go.  Well, can you say your names? 
[01:37:30]  We have a lot of...  Mike?  Bobby.  All right.  Mike and Bobby.  Are you guys going to go to the game together?  We only have one pair, unfortunately.  I haven't even worked it out.  We'll work that out.  We'll figure it out.  All right.  Well, you've got tickets to game four at the stadium.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  Huh?  They got game five.  Oh, they got game five?  Hmm.  What if there isn't a game five?  Suppose they sweep.  Yeah, really?  I know.  Thanks.  Do you know how long we waited?  If they do sweep, we'll find something good for you.  Can we go on the Aerosmith roller coaster?  Yeah, we'll send down the Aerosmith roller coaster. 
[01:38:00]  Because I was too much of a pussy to go on.  I want to be in the first car, first seat.  All right.  So they got tickets to game five.  Yeah.  And then we asked for a fireman.  And we got a fireman.  What do we got?  You came down, and you had to get a couple of guys to bring your ID?  Yeah.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Because we were...  Yeah, we were being a little leery, you know.  You come down without ID, it's like, well, I got a shirt.  Yeah, you don't know how many people aren't walking around with a fire department.  I was going to say, NYPD shirts these days.  These days, yeah, you don't know.  So we had to make sure.  But where are you working at? 
[01:38:30]  23.  23?  You lose any guys?  That's cool.  Yeah, we lost the guys that were working that day.  Damn.  That blows.  It's been tough.  I bet.  Jeez.  It's a good thing, though, people coming together, helping you guys out and stuff.  People coming by the place.  That's good.  Stop them by.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we got tickets for you as well.  Game four.  Yeah.  That's on Sunday.  All right?  Appreciate it.  Watch the Yanks kick some ass.  I like it.  We appreciate it.  No problem.  He's behind Seattle.  Well, you know, he won't say anything one way or another, but he has kind of just given 
[01:39:00]  a little info out there how he feels that Seattle is a very strong team.  Yeah.  I respect Seattle.  He respects them.  There you go.  They've done a lot with what they have.  Run to your bookie.  Luke Piniella is, uh, run to your bookie.  Luke Piniella should win coach of the year, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's all I want to hear.  He loses Rodriguez and Griffey, and look what he does.  Look at what he does.  Huh?  What'd you say?  Scott Muni really doesn't work here anymore?  No.  Scott Muni is gone, man. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, wow.  Two for Tuesday.  Guys, enjoy the game, and, you know, what more can we say?  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  That was the best.  We really appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for all the support you've given all of us.  No, thank you, man.  Thank you.  First time I felt safe.  I walked down the hall, and there's, like, ten NYPD guys.  I'm like, cool.  Nothing's going to happen to me today.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There they go.  Going to the Yankee game.  There you go.  All right.  You want to blow out the Jimmy Walker stuff before we take a break? 
[01:40:00]  Have you heard this, Ben?  I just got to say something.  I think we've got to play this in New York, can't we?  I got to say something quick, too.  You know, when you see the cops and the firemen and stuff, it's weird, because, especially  on TV and the way it's been portrayed over there, they're called heroes, which they actually  are.  But then you realize that they're just regular guys.  They like going out for a drink.  They like going to the game and stuff.  So, when you look at it like there's some kind of robots or something or superhero things, 
[01:40:30]  no, they've gone above and beyond, and they are heroes.  But it's more important that they are just, when you hang out with them, they're regular  guys, man.  And those are the guys that were out there and lost their lives and everything, and it's  a shame.  I mean, you've got to remember the human side of it, that they are just guys.  I had to ask the firemen if he lost any guys, and the lucky game, he's like, oh.  I think, of course, man.  You know, we'll never forget, but you'd like to think of them as just these robotic superheroes  that walked into those buildings and were taking people out. 
[01:41:00]  But, you know, they have families and friends, and they're, you know, they enjoy just hanging  out.  It's cool.  You know, it was cool the other night in Philly, and contrary to what Psycho Mark will  try and tell you, when Keith got announced to the crowd, he got the loudest applause.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Even though Mark will tell you that he was the most popular person there.  Fox, I'm more important.  They loved me.  We should give Psycho Mark like 10 minutes next time at the road show.  Yeah.  So he can eat it on the stage and see how it's like. 
[01:41:30]  You don't know what you're talking about.  I'm the funniest guy there.  They love me.  I can go down there and pack a place.  All right, let's get into the J.J. Walker.  Jimmy J.J. Walker.  Had his own radio show in Nebraska, I think it was, a few years back.  Was it Nebraska?  I think it was Nebraska.  That was even the biggest kicker.  It's like, what the hell is this guy doing in Nebraska?  How low can you go?  Yeah.  J.J.  J.J.  By the way, real fast.  Thank you, Budweiser, for giving us those Yankee tickets for the guys. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  So J.J. was doing a show, and he doesn't like any reference to being J.J.  He's Jimmy Walker.  He was doing a very serious political talk show.  We found out he was doing this.  We'd call up and kind of ask him questions about the serious thing he was talking about,  and then slam him with some good times questions.  And he was trying to be all nice and light about it, but you could tell he was just getting steamed.  Jimmy Walker.  Here we go.  Kick our Jimmy Walker show.  Your first day.

Talking about gangs and the eradication of them.  And I don't know why we are so delicate and gentle with these people.  It's not necessary.  God, just like termites are roaches.  They should be eradicated. 
[01:43:30]  And we seem to really be concerned about rehabilitating roaches.  I mean, imagine that.  You know, getting roaches to be better roaches.  My goodness.  Wouldn't that be nice to have a good training roach around the house?  But use one, man.  Greg, you're on with Jimmy J.J. Walker.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi, J.J.?  How you doing, buddy?  Hi.

J.J. was in a gang.  You see how serious he sounds?  Oh, he gets so pissed.  We must eradicate the, like, cockroaches.  Jimmy Walker.  Don't call him J.J.  We called him all day long.  We got on about ten times.  Oh, yeah.  We'll play one more clip here. 
[01:44:30]  Getting pranked J.J. on his little talk show.  This is CNN Radio News.  Is hair loss affecting your self-confidence?  I'm Brian Reichler, General Manager at Kevis.  Hi, Brian.  I've been suffering from hair loss myself for over 20 years.  So what do you do, Brian?  Do you flip it over the top?  I've tried dozens of remedies and blown thousands of dollars.  Or do you use some of that spray stuff and spray it all over your scalp and make it look like a big spray-painted head?  I've had a healthy head of hair, and I've been follically impaired.  That's what you think.  Everyone around the office thinks they have a dead skull on your head. 
[01:45:00]  For over one year, Kevis has achieved a 90% success rate.  Hundreds of thousands of men and women of all nationalities have used Kevis successfully.  You know what Kevis is?

[01:46:00]  Talking about it all.  And we got people that want to talk to me and they want to talk to you.  They got the hour.  They want the power.  You know I give it to them.  You're on with Jimmy J.J. Walker.  How you doing, Tony?  Jimmy.  How are you, sir?  Hey, it's great to hear the show finally a voice of reason that we could listen to on the radio.  Well, I think I'm reasonable.  That's all.  I just consider myself a logical right person.  Yeah, that's great because I want to talk about the political correctness going on in Washington. 
[01:46:30]  That's what I think about all this gun control that's going on there.  They're going after the innocent people.  Well, the innocent people are the people that have applied for guns legally.  Absolutely.  Done the whole deal.  Like I said earlier, the horse is out of the barn.  You know, I'm of a belief that I think we should abolish that, Brady and all that other stuff,  because those who have guns are going to have them in terms of the illegal people.  Yeah.  Those of us, you know, who apply normally, I mean, we don't want to commit crimes. 
[01:47:00]  We want to follow the law, but it seems like they don't want us to do that.  That's exactly what I'm getting.  You ever see us to roll naked?  Thank you.  Hey, how's Rerun doing?  We did that all day long, man.  We just pounded him.  We'd bait him with the real question, and then he'd just hang up on us when we get to the JJ thing.  All right.  Well, there's a little taste.  We've got about eight more clips.  Why don't we take a break? 
[01:47:30]  I know what we can do.  Go on a break.  The famous Opie Loves Florida thing for the 08 archive.  Speaking of good times, yes.  Check this little ditty out.  We'll be back.  You know, I stole the Playboy with Florida in it.  No, wait.  Florida.  Thelma, Thelma, Thelma.  James.  James.  No, no, no, no, no.  James, Opie's looking at me, James.  Look, I got that big pack of hot dogs stabled in the back of my neck.  James.  Where's JJ? 
[01:48:00]  Thelma.  You said Florida.  Everyone heard it.  Opie had the hospital Florida when he was a kid.  Come on, everyone heard it.  Opie.  Come here, give me some love.  Little brown sugar, Opie.  James.  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right, all right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right.  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up.  Now you've gone too far, man. 
[01:48:30]  You said it, man.  Yeah.  How about that Anesta, Opie?  Shut up.  Come here, heathen.  I could never squeeze out syrup out of that Aunt Jemima bottle without thinking, wow, what a hot babe.  Yeah.  I'd lose my syrup.  Well, you heard it here, folks.  Opie, hots for Florida from good times.  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw, but I guess it's in Opie's personal collection. 
[01:49:00]  The one with Florida.  James, I'm naked and Playboy.  All right.  Son of a...  James!  Now, J.J., I have company this evening.  Opie's coming over.  After James got killed, remember that?  She would have liked a guy like you. 
[01:49:30]  Shut up.  You'd have fit good in the projects.  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of Michael, the younger brother.  Yes.  Yes.  Remember how angry he was.  That's right.  I don't think Opie would have cut the mustard.  Michael.  His hair and everything.  Mama?  Why are you dating that white boy?  He's very nice.  Now, come on.  Let Mama go out with Opie.  James! 
[01:50:00]  Mama, he's the devil.  Well, he's showing the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me.  Of course, he can't stack up the chains where it counts.  You know, this picking on someone is not that fun ever.  I always thought it was fun to pick on people. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, it's a blast.  Come on this side.  You guys have deteriorated to be on belief right now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  And we're back with the O and A show.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Very busy day today, Ann.  Hell yeah.  Look at who we got on the phone right now.  We have Dennis Quaid.  Dennis Quaid's on the phone.  Now, what is he? 
[01:51:00]  Doing a gig tonight with his band?  Hogs and Heifers.  He's going to be performing down there.  The first and 95th.  Right here in New York City.  I guess he's got a band.  So he's going to be performing with the band.  Every actor has a band.  It's like the hip thing to do.  Just don't say it's 30-odd foot of grunts.  You know what?  You've got to start this interview talking like Mickey Rooney from the movie Bill.  He was in.  Dennis Quaid was in one of my favorite movies of all time. 
[01:51:30]  Bill with Mickey Rooney as the retarded older gentleman.  And Dennis Quaid was Gary or Barry Marrow.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's talk to Dennis Quaid.  Let's talk to him.  Get him on.  There he is.  Pull him up.  Take him off hold.  Hang up.  There we go.  Yep.  Hello.  Is this Barry Moore? 
[01:52:00]  Hello.  Barry Morrow.  Hi, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Okay.  Get a hold of yourself now.  I got good hair and good teeth.  I'm not a crack-minded old man.  Okay, Mickey.  Get a hold of yourself.  I'm looking for Barry Morrow.  9-3-5-6-8-2-25-18-3-9.  Yeah.  Well, you're good.  You got to do the chicken.  You got to do the chicken.  Oh, boy. 
[01:52:30]  Chicken.  Oh, I love chicken.  Now, Bill, remember your ulcer.  No, I'm fine.  I love chicken.  I love chicken.  And then Dennis has to go chase him into the corner of the kitchen.  Dennis, one of my favorite movies of all times is Bill with you and Mickey Rooney.  Yeah.  It was a movie.  I mean, you were just early into your career.  Yeah.  And I...  I've had experience working with Mickey, too.  With Mickey Rooney.  How was that? 
[01:53:00]  He's a legend.  Oh, I got stories.  I bet.  You haven't got a long enough radio show.  Oh, yeah, we do.  I got to tell you, I had a girlfriend punch me in the face because of that movie.  It was a TV movie.  It had just come out.  And I'm over her house.  We're sitting watching it, and she's crying.  She's crying at Mickey's performance.  And I start laughing my ass off.  She hits me.  She called me an insensitive prick and punched me in the face.  Yeah, well, you got to admit, that was some funny stuff, though. 
[01:53:30]  When he's running around, I'm looking for my sister.  She lived on Florida Street.  And she chases the old lady.  No.  No.  It's not me.  I'm not your sister.  Please.  Hey, buddy.  Come on, classic.  Dennis, you got to admit, no one else has ever brought up Bill to you.  No, no.  I got to tell you, I'm really impressed.  Usually they talk about Jaws 3D, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space, Traffic, Any Given Sunday.  Come on.  Hey, by the way, thanks for helping wreck the Jaws series. 
[01:54:00]  We greatly appreciate that.  Thanks.  Thank you so much.  Jaws 1, unbelievable.  Jaws 2, okay.  Jaws 3.  It was 3D, though, which was kind of cool.  My 9-year-old favorite movie.  Is it?  Yeah.  And Frequency was great.  I love Frequency.  I got to tell you, that was a really good movie.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  Didn't do much in the film, right?  In fact, we used the Great Jones Firehouse down near the Bowery.  And those guys lost 10 guys the other day.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  A lot of the guys we were working with.  So now you got a band?  Yeah, we're called the Sharks.  The Sharks.  And what kind of music do you do?  We play rock and roll, blues, country, a little jazz.  You're at Hogs and Heifers tonight?  Yeah.  Do you sing, Dennis?  You'll make up your mind about that, I guess, won't you?  Well, now, you sang in Great Balls of Fire.  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  So you've got a voice.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  I've written some songs for some films and things like that.  I've been doing this since I was 12. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Dennis, if you're hanging out at Hogs and Heifers tonight, I'm looking forward to the  drunken pictures of you in the paper tomorrow.  My God.  Woo!  They nail you every time.  I don't know why you go down there.  They nail you in the post the next day every time.  No, not every time.  You don't know about the other time.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, maybe.  Well, you got that right.  It's only the pictures I've seen.  But it's so funny.  You open up, and there's Dennis.  His eyes are going, I don't know which way.  He's on top of the bar.  He's dancing.  There's a nude girl next to him. 
[01:55:30]  Fabulous.  The life of you.  What was I going to do?  Be a spoiled sport?  Hell no, man.  Party.  Hell no.  Coming out party.  Anyway, it's a raucous place.  Yeah.  It'll be a good time for anybody who comes down.  We'll guarantee you that.  Who else has gone down there, Ben, and gotten into trouble?  Harrison Ford.  Did you see him down there?  Harrison Ford?  No.  I think he likes that.  No, we were on different shifts.  Last time I saw Harrison Ford's picture as he left Hogs and Heifers, it was in the backseat  of a car, two girls just on top of him, and he was in the paper again a couple of days 
[01:56:00]  later announcing his divorce.  So, I don't know, Hogs and Heifers is like, that's a party place.  Oh, I announced my divorce before I went down there.  Yeah, well, that's good.  Well, not good, I'm sure.  Well, what it's worth.  Yeah, you guys were together for a while, and that was kind of a surprise.  Yeah.  Do you, uh...  Will you punch Russell Crowe in the face the next time you see him?  You want to punch Russell Crowe in the face?  No comment, no comment.  Yeah, that son of a bitch.  Can he leave some girls for other people, for God's sake?  The guy's riding high and everything, I understand, but Jesus Christ. 
[01:56:30]  How about backing off for a second?  You want me to go back to Bill, Dennis?  You were doing well there for a while.  Oh, boy, I hate Russell Crowe, too, Barry.  Oh, man.  What a blast.  Tickets available at the door tonight for 20 bucks.  You're also shooting a movie in the city?  Yeah, I'm doing a movie with Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore called Far From Heaven. 
[01:57:00]  And I think we're the only film actually shooting in New York right now.  Yeah, they're bringing it back.  Nice.  They just started that up again because they canceled all the shoots for a while.  Have you been down to Ground Zero?  Yeah, I went down there.  In fact, I was down there today.  Yeah, what do you think?  Really something else.  Isn't it?  Everyone says that TV just doesn't do it justice.  Well, yeah, it's a lot bigger.  And, of course, the smell of it is not on television.  Yeah.  And the people down there, I can't believe what huge hearts everyone has.  Yeah.  It hits you in a way. 
[01:57:30]  In fact, we're going to pass the jug around tonight for the Great Jones Firehouse for the orphans and widows down there for everybody.  And so beyond that, we're just going to have a really good time.  Yeah.  That's great, man.  Hell yeah.  We love that.  The hogs and heifers, it's uptown, not downtown.  The one that's on 95th and 1st.  Yeah, 1st Avenue, 95th.  Yeah.  I'll be down there, Barry.  Okay.  All right, Dennis.  Hey, wait. 
[01:58:00]  I've got to ask you real fast.  You flew with the Blue Angels?  Yeah, a couple of times.  How was that?  Well, one time, actually, I'm a pilot, so I got to fly it.  That was something else.  And the second time, I was sitting back seat during a practice show.  And I felt really great for about 40 minutes.  And then I really just wanted to puke or just have him just take the plane right into the ground because that was it.  Did you get an interest in that from doing the right stuff?  Yeah.  That's when I started flying. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, that is?  Yeah.  That was another just great movie, man.  Yeah.  That was a cool movie.  It was the time of my life.  And then you decided to start flying.  Yeah.  You have a jet license?  Yeah, I fly a citation jet.  Look at this guy.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What a life.  I know.  Yeah.  I'll be your co-pilot.  Okay, Bill.  All right, man.  We'll go to Florida Street.  We talk about that movie all the time on this radio show. 
[01:59:00]  We can't get enough of it.  All right.  Well, Dennis, we know you got to get ready.  Your guitar player's been listening in.  He wanted to hear.  Wait, let me see what he's all about.  Jamie James?  Jamie.  Jamie.  Yeah.  Jamie James.  Yeah, I'm here listening.  Yeah.  Jamie.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm just making sure you guys ask all the right questions.  Otherwise, I'll have to come down there and kick your ass.  Jamie, you've been in bands how many years?  I've been playing.  I got my first electric guitar in 1966.  And Dennis is the best guy I've ever played with. 
[01:59:30]  That's cool, man.  That's a good role.  Using the S-word on the air.  Very nice, Jamie.  Thank you, you rock star.  We can see both of you guys tonight.  Hogs and Hevers First Avenue 95th.  I want to ask Jamie if we asked all the right questions, did we?  Yeah, you guys aced it, man.  We kind of tiptoed around the Meg Ryan thing, you know.  You guys aced it all right.  Tiptoed, all right.  Hey, Jamie.  You've got dirt all over your pants like that.  Jamie, you ever see Bill with Mickey Rooney?  He's here with me now. 
[02:00:00]  He travels with us.  It's a great movie.  I would suggest everyone rents it.  You know what I would suggest?  Because seriously, like Ann said, Frequency was unbelievable.  Great movie, yeah.  That last scene, man, teary eyeballs.  Yeah.  When I'm playing softball, it's like, wow, blew me away.  Yeah.  Hey, I want you to remember one thing about Mickey Rooney, though.  Yeah.  He was married to Ava Gardner.  Yeah.  That's true.  The guy was like the hot shot of Hollywood for many years, man.  I used to bust a nut 24-7, baby. 
[02:00:30]  I got more ass than Russell Crowe.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry, Dennis Berry.  I think Mickey Rooney's so old now, he went down in his own toupee.  Oh, God.  Would you stop?  All right, guys.  I don't want to keep you any longer.  Say anything that would put off another interview at some other point.  So, Dennis, thanks a lot.  Good luck tonight.  And, Jamie, have fun, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for being easy.  Thanks for being a good sport, man.  There he is.  Dennis Quaid and his drummer, Jamie.  Jamie James.  Guitar player. 
[02:01:00]  Sorry, sorry.  Guitar player.  There you go.  We'll get hogs and heffers.  We're on 1st Avenue and 95th Street.  Tickets available at the door.  $20.  Oh, boy.  Dennis Quaid and the Sharks.  I'm going to go tonight.  I got to see Barry singing.  He lost his mind.  And I started doing, Bill.  You know, I love being able to pull something out that you just damn well know no one talks to him about.  Bill.  A lot of fun. 
[02:01:30]  You ever think you'd see the day you get to talk to Dennis Quaid about Bill?  Dude, I've been doing that since 1981.  So, yeah, finally.  It's been fun.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Yo, dude.  That J.J. Walker into that whole area, man, was the funniest half-hour video I think I've heard.  We love it, J.J.  It's actually the last time in the summertime when you did the Bill thing, dude.  Oh, boy.  Cool.  That was an excellent, excellent ex, man.  That was great.  Well, we had fun with Dad.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Very good.  Thank you. 
[02:02:00]  You see how he just clammed up with the background?  Hey, don't go back to Bill there and Dennis.  He handled it well.  It's our first movie star, I think.  You know something as far as a movie star of that caliber?  I think so.  You know?  I don't think we've had, really.  Who else have we had?  No, Rick.  I said movie star.  Jay Moore doesn't count.  Oh!  Now it's mine!  I'm looking at a clip of Brother Joe from the Roadshow from Philly.  Yeah.  And he's dressed up as Shecky Bin Laden? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  And ants about ready to hit the stage with the paint gun and completely destroy your brother.  I came out in camis with a very high-powered paint gun and just raked him.  Here I go.  I was stalking him.  Oh, my God.  In commando fashion.  Someone got some great video clips of the Roadshow.  This is Jeff Stuff?  Jeff from foundrymusic.com?  Good stuff.  I'm telling you, man.  Oh, there I go.  Wow!  Holy crap!  Look, I'm just chewing him up.  He falls down because it's hurting him so bad and I just keep shooting him. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, that hurt.  I got closer.  He's running away.  Dude, you're hitting a point blank with a paint gun.  That's for hitting me when I was eight.  And then Ant walks off stage and the crowd is going nuts and Psycho Mark is just losing his S at the end of the clip.  Going gack, gack, gack.  That clip and more on the web.  Where can people go for that?  Foundrymusic.com or opieandanthony.com?  Yeah, opieandanthony.com has a link right to Foundry Music. 
[02:03:30]  I'm telling you, there's like 30 clips up and you can see what you saw if you were there or you can see what you missed.  On Florida Street.  No!  But the website's getting pounded, I just got to say real fast, Dan.  So, you know, check it out later on this weekend.  You'll get to see some really good stuff.  The stalker Patty getting drenched by beer is, well, I don't know, that clip I just saw was really good too.  Make a left.  Remember that when he gets in Barry's car? 
[02:04:00]  He gets in Barry's car, Mickey Rooney there and Dennis Quaid.  And he goes, I want to go to my sister's.  So, he's telling Barry, he goes, go.  Okay, make a right.  Make a left.  He doesn't know where he's going.  He's just telling him, turn at the corner.  And then he sees a woman walking down the street.  He goes, there's Sarah.  My sister's Sarah.  And he starts chasing her down the street.  He goes, Sarah.  It's just this little nutjaw Mickey with the toupee on his head and rotten teeth chasing this woman.  The woman turns around and goes, I am not Sarah. 
[02:04:30]  My name is Ida.  I am Ida.  Get away.  I have no money.  Get Dennis back on the phone.  We're going to mess with him some more.  Ah, what a lot of fun, man.  Dennis Quaid, who knew?  Oh, we did interview Joe Pesci.  That's right.  That was, that's a big star.  That's right.  You know, um.  And he was, because he was singing.  Holy ass.  Get the, get the Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci.  You know, because in the latest Stuff magazine, they talk about how horrible that CD was that he put out. 
[02:05:00]  Awful.  It's on my desk.  Can someone run and get that really fast?  It was some kind of goodfellas, wise guy.  It's left of my keyboard.  He was singing like, uh, Italian mob songs.  What was it?  Uh, uh, Cousin Vinny.  Uh, Cousin Vinny rap song.  Rap song.  Awful.  That's what we got.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  You want to know how pathetic this radio station was at the time?  When we would go out to promotional events. 
[02:05:30]  Roger thought it was a great idea to hand those CDs out.  So we would hand out those CDs.  I remember one night we got them flaunt.  You know, people were just hucking back.  Of course they're going to throw them back.  But it was a good promotional idea.  Opie handled the interview with Joe Pesci.  And I must say, I was in fear for Opie's life for days after.  It's definitely a cringe moment.  You're jerking Pesci around bad, man.  As Earl would say, baby evil.  Evil.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  Mike Epp from Jersey.  Listen to this one. 
[02:06:00]  What about your Russell Crowe interview?  Wasn't that classic?  You guys don't miss a beat ever.  Oh, wow.  You sure Dan from Hoboken didn't change his name?  Because that's something Dan would have picked up on.  What movie was Bill in?  It was called Bill.  Yeah.  It was just Bill.  There was a sequel.  Don't get it confused.  It was called Bill on His Own.  And it wasn't as good.  It sucked.  The original Bill.  Oh, the movie is horrendous.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't supposed to be funny.  No, no.  With a twisted sense of humor, you definitely will laugh. 
[02:06:30]  It's Mickey Rooney's interpretation of an old, retarded gentleman that just kills me.  And Dennis Quaid is the young filmmaker who decides he's going to do a documentary on  this guy.  And it's hysterical.  When he takes him back to the loony bin that he used to be at to film him there, and  he starts freaking out in the hallways because he thinks he's going to leave him there.  Buddy!  Buddy!  I thought you were leaving me.  He's wearing that wig on his head. 
[02:07:00]  He had the rotten teeth, and he's playing the harmonica.  And all I can think of is how much that must stink.  Hey, now, what's up?  One and M.  Yo, what's up?  Oh, oh, Anthony.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Yo, let me tell you guys something.  This is probably...  I've been listening since you guys first came on in New York.  Nice.  This is probably the best show I've heard in years, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe because we had a good night's sleep last night, I don't know.  No, it's that Mickey Rooney, man.  You're killing me.  We love Mickey.  You're killing me.  The weed is making my heart race fast.  By the way, guys, thanks for giving us a break and not noticing that we bailed on our 
[02:07:30]  own radio show yesterday.  You asses.  We punched out.  We pulled the damn cord and punched out of our show yesterday.  We punched out at 6.30.  The email went nuts.  Where'd you go?  Yo-ho.  This was how the bit began.  Hold on.  Yeah, hey guys, I was, uh, uh, hey guys, uh, it was at Spinal Tap last night.  I know.  When we were in Philly, we picked the worst bit.  We could have probably picked something that most people would have thought we were still 
[02:08:00]  here.  It's because we were out of it, gone.  The abuse you guys gave us.  We were done.  We were burnt.  During spots, I couldn't even sit here without yawning every, I swear, it was every two seconds  I was yawning.  Hey, how you doing with the drugs, Dan?  Yo.  Yo.  How you doing with the dope?  Yo, yo, I'm straight.  Yo.  All right, now, we gotta let you go, all right?  Wait, can I ask you one question?  Yeah.  I got the cover of the, uh, The Men in World in front of me right now.  Yeah.  Yo, oh, what's up with the dreadlocks, man?  You like the dreadlocks?  I hope you're sporting the dreads, man. 
[02:08:30]  Anthony with the afro.  I got the big poodle.  The Haywood Nelson afro.  Yo, you guys take care, man.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Bye.  This guy's claiming to be Joe Pesci.  Joe.  Yeah, why do you want to keep me on hold here?  Uh, Joe, how you doing, man?  You still having fun with the CD, I see, huh?  Yeah, we're having a lot of fun with it.  What's the matter?  You know, we, we, we...  I thought we talked before and everything was swayed away.  We, we played, uh, uh, the CD, and, uh, we still play It's the Bitches That'll Get You's. 
[02:09:00]  What's the mockery about?  It's just...  Look, it was Opie, first of all.  Well, he'll be throwing stuff back and forth who's who.  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  Joe, you can't curse.  We're, um...  Come on, man.  Joe.  Yeah.  Don't curse.  Don't you have a mini-week, uh, commercial with that?  Damn it, that's what I got you.  You know, Drummond?  You know, Drummond, I suck.  You had me for a second, because... 
[02:09:30]  That's it?  You do, you do a very good pesci, but it sounds like a mini-week.  Damn it.  Damn it.  If I haven't heard that mini-week, uh, seen that mini-week commercial a million times,  then you know what he got me, man.  Damn it.  It's the voice of the...  Are you the sugary side?  I just lost a bet with my old man.  I was betting him a hundred bucks.  I could fool you.  Norris, are you the sugary side?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  He's the sugary side of the mini-week in the mini-week commercial.  Who's the non-sugary side?  Who's the non-sugary side?  Believe it or not, it's a guy from London.  Really?  Yeah, he's from Paris. 
[02:10:00]  That's his real voice.  How about...  He's, like, 52 years old.  Yeah.  Damn, I thought I could get you.  Very...  Well, you do a great pesci.  Is it better than Jay Moore's pesci?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I'll crack that little frickin' gold guy away in his frickin' mouth, okay?  No, your pesci's really good, bro.  How you guys been, all right?  Yeah, come in and see us.  Yeah, I'll come up next week.  We're slowly but surely getting back to normal.  Yeah, we're trying to on this end.  It's been tough with what's been going on.  Don't ever forget, my friend.  All right, buddy.  All right, come see us.  All right, thank you.  Cool.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break. 
[02:10:30]  We'll find the Joe Pesci thing.  It is classic.  It's the bitches out of bitches.  He wanted to promote the CD.  Here it is.  Vincent LaGuardia Gambini sings just for you.  Okay, buddy.  Buddy!  When he pulled up after he hadn't seen him for a while.  Buddy!  Hey, he looks in his face like he wants to give him a beat.  You know.  Yeah.  Hey.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't stomach them.  We can't let these people reproduce. 
[02:11:00]  How does he know class?  In the toilet.  They'll never work in the town again.  Disgusting.  How do they let this on the air?  We suck.  Everyone hates us.  Childish.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're getting the Joe Pesci thing together here.  Erica, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  You tell us.  I was just thinking, instead of Boo-O-Lantern, you should be calling that Rack-O-Lantern. 
[02:11:30]  Rack-O-Lantern?  Yeah.  Rack-O-Lantern.  Like Jack-O-Lantern.  Jack-Rack.  Jack-Rack.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  Does it?  I thought it was worth better.  What's up?  What's in a name?  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  All right.  A boob by any other name.  Are you coming down?  It feels so good.  When is it and where is it?  Well, here's the deal.  If you're just tuning in, Boo-O-Lantern is a go.  Next week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, we're asking the ladies to come down 
[02:12:00]  that have breast implants.  Very important that you have breast implants for this contest.  We personally love the natural boobs, but what we want to do doesn't work as well with  the natural boobs, okay?  I got that.  All right.  So we're looking for girls with breast implants.  They got to come down Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  We're going to take a before picture and an after picture.  The before picture is you and your loveliness.  The after picture is with all the lights out and two flashlights under your boobs.  What's going to happen is the breast implants light up like pumpkins that you see on the 
[02:12:30]  front porches.  And then you see all the redness of the various blood vessels in the breast.  That kind of gives it a nice little orange tinge to it.  Okay.  Matter of fact, we got an example of what the boob-o-lantern will look like on opiateanthony.com.  Also, we got all the rules and details for the boob-o-lantern contest, all right?  Yep.  But basically, the ladies come down Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  Open invite.  You don't have to call and say you're coming. 
[02:13:00]  Just show up with your implants, okay?  Yeah, I gotcha.  And you do it between three and seven while we're on the air.  We take some pictures of you and everyone will check you out on the website.  You'll become a star.  Okay.  So, all right?  Cool, guys.  Okay.  Thanks.  And a little twist to this contest.  We happen to be broadcasting live in Boston October 29th and 30th, which is a Monday and  Tuesday.  So, on those two days when we're in Boston, we're encouraging the Boston ladies with the  implants to come down to the BCF studios.  And we'll do the boob-o-lantern up there as well. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  And we'll put everybody on the website.  We've got a great prize.  Still to be determined, but we've been doing pretty well with that lately.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  Ben's laughing, but you know we've gotten better.  Remember when all we had was the Darth Vader coffee mug?  Come on.  We've stepped it up a bit.  Darth Vader coffee mug in the prize closet.  Thank you.  People are arguing over retard movies.  Oh, yeah?  I could settle it right now.  Bill is better than any other retard movie.  Then, a close second place is The Other Sister with the always fun and always retarded Giovanni 
[02:14:00]  Ribisi, who plays a retard in every movie, whether he wants to or not.  And then, as Andy says, Sean Cassidy and Linda Pearl in Normal People or whatever the  hell that was called.  Great retard movie.  We should have a retard movie film festival.  Not a bad idea.  Rent them all for a weekend.  Not a bad idea.  Troy, what's up?  Hey, man.  I drive a truck in the D.C. area.  Yeah.  And, man, I listen to JFK all day long, man, and you guys are a great addition. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, thanks.  And I've never brought radio into my house before, man, but I live all the way down in  Southern Maryland, and I got me a little antenna that's constructed, and I'll get you guys.  I'll listen to you in the house, man.  I'll bring you home with me.  Well, man.  Can you spread the word down there in D.C.?  Oh, yeah, I am, man.  The guys at work, I got me a big old wow spray painted on the back of my truck and  haven't been hit yet, but it's a matter of time.  We certainly could use the help in Washington.  Yeah, man.  I hope you get down here.  After they made the switch and moved Don and Mike to Middays. 
[02:15:00]  Hey, you know, Don Geronimo became the program director, I think, there, right?  I think it was a great move.  It's going to happen for you guys.  I don't understand it.  Hopefully.  Dude, you know, I don't want to piss off Don, but it's just a title, all right?  Opie's got the same title up here.  Yeah, yeah.  I get the same title up here, which means I get to go to lunch with Suzy.  That wasn't his idea, eh?  All right.  Thank you, Troy.  Hey, thank you, dude.  All right.  But I must say, that is a ridiculous little title to ask. 
[02:15:30]  I was offered a title, but I couldn't think one up.  That's how important it was.  Maybe we're going to give you some kind of a computer game.  Yeah, head of computer game.  Right.  Research.  Fascinating.  Anyway, yeah, we need the help in Washington, D.C.  Yeah.  After they made the brilliant move of taking the number one radio show out of afternoon drive  and moving it to middays, pretty much everyone has fled.  We are, this program is very good at patching the hole on the sinking ship and pumping the 
[02:16:00]  water out and letting it float once again.  All we do to ships that are beautiful and floating nicely is put big holes in the side.  It's just the opposite.  We really, we love coming into stations that are doing lousy.  Well, they, yeah, they fled.  So we have to rebuild.  I mean, they fled to the point where Ken was busy the last two days in front of his 
[02:16:30]  little laptop trying to make sense of the ratings in Washington because, yeah, because  the big boss, you know, the big boss, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, you mean Lou,  was calling him going, what the F did you do?  Look what you did.  Look what you did to my station.  So now he's working the numbers to, you know, to try to make it look like something is actually  happening for us in Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Too funny. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Oh, oh, Stacy's got something real quick.  If we could go to line 10, something about the Bill movie again.  Stacy?  Stacy?  Ed.  Hey, what's up?  You're missing the great way Bill used to introduce himself.  How?  My name is William Bill for short.  Bill for short.  Bill for short.  I thought she meant the way he met Barry.  He was working at that party in the kitchen scrubbing something and he goes, my boss is  going to kick me in the head if I don't clean up. 
[02:17:30]  All right, Stacy.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Love retard movies.  Let's move on to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  You know there's a, like, blurb and a picture of you guys in the new penthouse?  Really?  Really?  Yes.  Yeah, it's like, like, you guys did the pet of the year thing, right?  Oh, we were like the masters of ceremony.  Of what?  That's the picture.  It's like a little blurb.  You know what they do?  I thought you knew the people over there.  They call you shock jocks.  Oh, fuck.  There's a picture of you and Ann on stage and you have this bad jacket on open. 
[02:18:00]  It was a microphone and then Ann has a microphone and, of course, a beer.  Wait, I have a bad jacket on?  Yeah, it looks like a bad jacket, dude.  Trying to think of what I was wearing.  I don't remember.  Hey, listen.  Anyway, you guys, if you got a chance, could you play that thing when the BBC called you guys?  Wow.  Ben was just talking about that today in the back office.  A lot of other cities that didn't hear that.  That was awesome.  Like, Kevin and Stinky were supposed to be you guys?  Yeah, we had them take our place.  Ooh. 
[02:18:30]  Ooh, with Stinky doing the Dyson impression.  Real quick, Ann, I got a George tribute question for you.  All right.  What kind of beer was Quint drinking when, remember, he looks at Dreyfus and he chugs the beer,  he crushes the can and Dreyfus drinks the coffee, crushes the cup.  Was it Rangold?  No.  What was it?  No, I got it.  Oh, okay.  This beer from Boston, where it was all this?  Cool.  Thank God I have some part of a life.  Oh, come on, dude.  You probably know more about the movie than I do.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:19:00]  Later, man.  Bye.  Okay, so we got the Joe Pesci thing.  I don't know how we got here, but we did.  This is what this show does.  We get to weird places.  The bitches out of the kitchen.  In the latest issue of FHM Magazine, I thought it was Stuff.  Uh-oh.  They're all the same.  They really are.  Shock Magazine.  They all like to think they're doing something, you know, different than the other ones,  but FHM, Stuff, Maxim, Details to a certain extent, they're all the same magazine now. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  They took Mark Golan's idea.  Mark Golan.  And now everyone's doing it.  Anyway, Traces of Genius has a little blurb here.  It says, each month, FHM shines a spotlight on one of the worst ideas in the history of mankind.  Kudos to Joe Pesci.  Who else would have dreamed of recording a concept album tied to a mediocre movie a mere six years after it appeared in theaters?  Released in 98, Vincent LaGuardia Gambini sings Just For You with something of an enigmas. 
[02:20:00]  Anit Pesci revives his character from My Cousin Vinny, then sings a series of off-tune, off-color songs,  including a ditty about murdering his girlfriend and her family.  What song is that?  What is that one?  He even raps.  Some would describe the 14-track collection as edgy.  They would be in the minority and stupid.  Offensive seems a much better description.  Still, Pesci thought the album was so important that he recorded the track Yo Cousin Vinny in English, Italian, and Spanish, 
[02:20:30]  so it could be enjoyed by people around the world.  Great.  Well, when this thing did come out about three years ago, in 98, we had a little interview with Joe Pesci.  Yes.  And this is Cringe Radio at its best.  Is this Joe?  Yes, this is Joe.  Joe.  Who am I talking to?  Is it Opie or Anthony?  Both of us.  Both of us, yeah.  What, are you guys talking from the same neck?  Pretty much there.  Connected like Siamese twins.  So, Mr. Pesci, I got your CD in front of me. 
[02:21:00]  How do you like it?  It looks great, anyway.  It looks good.  I saw the commercials for it this morning.  I'm laying in bed.  I see commercials for this thing.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  What is Joe Pesci doing?  What's this all about?  Well, I just, you know, Tommy Mottola and I from Sony decided, we talked a long time ago about doing this.  We thought it might be fun to hear a guy from the neighborhood sing all different type of songs, you know?  So, I did it as Cousin Vinny and did it with a Brooklyn accent so we could have some fun with it.  And we did little parodies on some songs that people know, you know. 
[02:21:30]  What, did you guys shake down some drug dealers for this cash to put this together?  I don't know.  You and Mottola?  I don't know what to think of this, to be honest with you.  Well, you have to play it and listen to it.  What do you mean you don't know?  All right.  All right.  We could do that.  What song do you suggest we play?  Well, I think your Cousin Vinny would be good.  Excuse Opie, Joe.  No, he's not a, you know, Paisan.  No.  Uh-oh.  He might not understand.  You'd be shoving me in the back of a car, I think.  Well, you can play Wise Guy, too, the rap thing, if you like it. 
[02:22:00]  If we like to...  Are you Joe Pesci rapping?  That's it.  I wrote a thing called Wise Guy.  Can you do a little rap for us on the phone?  No, I couldn't.  You don't know how hard that is.  Those guys are really good.  I didn't know how hard that was.  Yeah, a little white Italian guy.  Can't rap like a black guy.  No, I did it as a white guy.  All right, wait.  I got to hear Joe Pesci rapping.  This is Wise Guy off Joe Pesci's new CD.  Check it out.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen. 
[02:22:30]  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  Hey, hey, fade out my ass.  Tree all my bras like trash.  You'll catch a blast if you move too fast.  I talk for class.  You don't have to ask.  Getting everything by flash and cash.  Fighting and stealing, don't kill without stealing.  So I went in casinos before they started dealing.  All about respect and intellect.  Only mess with the women that pick up the check. 
[02:23:00]  Supermodels, one on each arm.  One chick's brunette, the other was blonde.  I heard their fathers had stocks and bonds.  So I fucked them up and left them floating in a pond.  Customated clothes from head to toe.  So do you expect to sell any of these things?  What do you mean do I expect to sell any of them?  Do you think I'm going to still pay for my house with them?  I'm going to tie my bathroom because of the little plastic squares.  He's going to whack you, Opie.  Listen, you're going to like it.  You'll have some fun with it.  Well, yeah.  Can I use it for a beer coaster, maybe?  I don't know.  I think you should try to play it first. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  He's getting mad.  I'm trying to get you mad.  I want to hear the fashion that we all know and love.  He's going to curse.  Do you have your bleeper in your hand?  Yeah, I do.  Go for it.  No, I don't want to do that.  Come on.  I'm the fastest bleeper in the world, actually.  Get the f*** out of here.  I hit it.  I hit it in time.  I hope so.  Come on.  Challenge me.  Go ahead.  No, that's it.  Come on.  I'll give you another plug for the CD.  No, that's it. 
[02:24:00]  You play it.  That'll be enough of a plug.  Hey, thanks.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Take it easy, Joe.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  A little excerpt from our Joe Pesci interview.  I don't expect to sell any of these things.  It's horrible.  Joe Pesci.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  It was horrible.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  Hey, Jesse's here from Survivor 3.  Survivor Africa.  Let's bring her in.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, what's up?  I was calling about that guy who noted your picture in Penthouse.  Yeah, yeah.  All the other stuff to look at in Penthouse, and he looks at you guys. 
[02:24:30]  What's that all about?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that was a little strange myself.  Yeah, that is odd.  Anyway, me and the other five guys who listen to you in D.C. just want to say you rock.  Thank you.  Please spread the word.  We need the help down there.  Later.  All right, man.  Look who's in the studio.  Jesse from Survivor Africa.  Hi, Jesse.  Hi, guys.  Survivor Africa.  I only saw the last ten minutes of the show last night when you guys were drinking blood,  and then you got kicked off.  Yes.  So I don't even know what happened last night.  I saw the first episode.  Drinking blood? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  What kind?  What was it?  The cow kind.  Oh, it was cow blood?  Yes.  Yeah, but wasn't it watered down, or it had something else in it?  Watered down?  Oh, no way.  Well, the finals, when the two tribes tied, then they went with a thicker blood.  Right.  What they did is they put milk to kind of cool it down.  Right.  That's what they did.  But it still had pieces of blood in there.  Right.  Cool it down?  It was just not as fresh as the other one, yes.  Was it fresh right out of the cow?  Right out of the cow.  Oh, man.  Oh, they just cut the jugular of the cow or something? 
[02:25:30]  They actually hit it with the arrow to get the blood.  Oh, and it's got like a tube, and it kind of comes out or something?  No, they hit it in the jugular bay and actually put the gore right to the neck, and it was  pouring down.  It's a Masai tradition.  They do it all the time.  You must have had a lot of gay guys in your tribe.  Why are they voting you out?  Are they insane?  Yeah, what happened?  Now there's no reason to watch the show.  I'll be honest.  I know there's a CBS representative here, but they just kicked out the hottest chick.  You know what happened?  I think it was me being sick, which is that you didn't watch the show. 
[02:26:00]  I was sick for like the first four days out of the six days that I was there, and then  towards the last two days, I was actually getting better, and I was doing good.  I was doing good in all the challenges, even though I was sick, but, you know, Kelly and  Kim both had messed up some of the challenges, so I think they saw me as kind of like a threat  to them, and, you know, the rest was history.  Who did you out?  I know.  Oh, that sucks.  Well, you know, it's just a game.  You've got to see it that way.  It's just a game.  Yeah, that's good.  Did Jeff Probst hit on you?  No, actually, I only got to see him during Tribal Council. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, because we hear he eventually gets around to having sex with all of the girls  on the show.  Really?  Yeah, he confirmed it on the phone the other day.  Yeah, that's what I got out of our interview with him.  He liked to think he didn't say that.  He didn't?  No, he did.  Damn.  What's wrong with that guy?  So how was it, how much time did you actually spend in Africa?  For the show, actually six days, and then three months.  Then three months, you were at a hotel somewhere where they put you in?  No hotel, we're actually staying at lodges. 
[02:27:00]  We went on a safari, me and Diane, which I met up, and kind of like campsites, just  on a tent.  Yeah?  Yep.  And you went on safari, so some animals and stuff?  Yeah, I went to like six or seven different places all around Kenya.  It was beautiful.  It was?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Do you have any problem with drinking or eating stuff over there?  Yeah, they all have problems.  You know what happens.  Jeff was kind of hinting that you guys all had the explosive diarrhea.  Oh, no, not at all.  From the water and stuff.  No.  She's not going to admit that now.  The girl's that attractive do not get explosive diarrhea. 
[02:27:30]  They won't admit it on a stupid radio show.  It's a rumor.  No, no, no.  I heard everyone had a problem with the stomach.  Let's just put it that way.  No, not really.  I think, no, Diane didn't.  She just kind of was dehydrated.  I didn't either.  I was just puking.  Just only the first day.  But other than that, no, not really.  The first episode, they showed them gathering their water.  Yeah.  You just saw where they were getting the water from.  Oh, my God.  Like a swamp, basically.  It wasn't a swamp, but what you saw was elephant dung, and God knows what other animals. 
[02:28:00]  Wait, and that's where the water came from, and then what did you do with it?  Yeah, well, you had to get it through.  You had to clean the area off to where you were able to get the water, and then once you  got the water in there, you had to boil it for three to five minutes.  Three to five minutes, and then it's fine.  No, because then it's just boiled elephant dung water.  It was elephant dung, and the water was maybe an inch over the elephant dung, and they're  trying to scrape it up, and some of the elephant dung is getting in the pails.  Get out of here.  And then there's, like, all sorts of bugs and stuff.  That was... 
[02:28:30]  Well, it wasn't pretty.  You know, that's why it's called Survivor.  Yeah, they went crazy this year with Survivor.  And then what did you have to eat?  We actually had some cornmeal, which we made ugali with, which is their...  Mmm, cornmeal.  Yeah, but, you know, it was still made with the same water that we were drinking, so it  didn't taste as good either.  I can't believe they made you do that.  How was the water?  You know, it boiled and everything.  It's not going to kill you.  It really did.  Yeah, why not?  You got a little bit of a potty mouth on you for the radio, don't you?  Hey, I'm a cop. 
[02:29:00]  No, just kidding.  You are a cop, right?  Yes, I am.  In the city?  Orlando.  Orlando.  Oh, I saw the New York City shirt.  I wasn't sure if you were from the city.  Orlando Cop.  Not too many tourists to deal with down there, right?  Oh, yeah, right.  What is...  What's the hardest thing an Orlando Cop's got to do, eh?  It seems like any time I've been there, it's all about Disney and Universal and...  That's because you probably don't get out of the tourist area.  Well, that's right.  You've got to come out to the town.  Winter Park.  You bust some head out there? 
[02:29:30]  Well, actually, I work with the college kids.  I'm in the college area.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  All right, so...  Have you ever had to take down a perp?  Tons of time, yeah.  And you cuff them and everything.  Oh, yeah, I've been hurt before.  Do they just look and go, get out of here, sweetheart?  What the hell are you going to do?  I wish it was that easy.  Why couldn't we play the cuffing game with her?  No, we play...  Let me tell you what.  We had...  I'm a good speed cuffer.  We were really stupid.  We've got to tell you what we did.  We were stupid.  We challenged NYPD, a couple of women, that they couldn't cuff us or that one of us would 
[02:30:00]  last longer than the other.  Yeah, the deal was all three went, and whoever lasted the longest won.  Won.  A stupid guy thing.  They kicked our asses, man.  I mean, put us down.  Knee to the back.  The choke hold was on Rick.  And, yeah, it was bad.  You girls, man.  Well, they always say women are tougher than men.  So, in Orlando, if you get pulled over by women, you know, you can already start seeing  their faces like, man, you know, couldn't it be the men?  Because they know they're going to get it worse from us. 
[02:30:30]  Do you see the guys when you pull them over and then you come to the window, do they go  like, hey, look at who this is?  You know?  Because you're not the stereotypical woman cop.  Yeah, you're too hot to be a cop.  I know I'm pissing off a bunch of cops out here.  It's like TV show woman cop, you know?  Do you ugly yourself up so they take it more seriously?  Well, I don't wear anything on my work.  It's just my uniform, a bun, and maybe some chapstick, which, trust me, I've learned to  love right now.  And from then on, it's just back to business.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  You ever let off a guy because you thought he was cute? 
[02:31:00]  No way.  See?  They get a worst.  That's something the guys do to the girls, though.  They'll pull over a girl, and if she's hot and stuff, you let her go.  No, no.  No, you don't?  No, you don't?  No, you don't anymore.  Mm-mm.  Jesus.  Someone just said you gave away the ending of the whole Survivor show.  George?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Ow.  Yo, she slipped up.  She said her and Diane went on a safari.  Oh, Diane got kicked out first.  Oh, never mind.  You idiot.  I got all excited, like, oh, call the rag magazines. 
[02:31:30]  We know who won Survivor.  Great job, Columbo.  All right, never mind then, guys.  I'm a tool.  Later.  You are quite a tool.  George the Tool.  Someone wants to ask the obvious question.  Did you guys get almost attacked by animals?  Were you afraid of Ebola?  Hmm.  Were we afraid of...  No, actually, one of the nights that we were out there, which you don't see on the show,  me and Tom were actually on guard, and we...  Well, we didn't see it, but we heard the lion around our camp. 
[02:32:00]  So that was the closest I probably got to getting a lion.  Thank God for our fence.  He wasn't able to jump it.  Not that he couldn't.  If he really wanted to, he could have, but...  Yeah, check this out.  I mean, this would have freaked me out.  They're in the middle of nowhere, and they pretty much tell them to build a fence so the lions can't get in.  Ah, there you go.  Build a lion fence.  You're used to doing that in Orlando.  They don't have any fence material.  It's just like, you know, whatever they can find.  Acacia.  It's called an acacia tree, which is like a little tree with some thorns on it.  It's actually pretty prickly.  I mean, I have marks on my legs all over from carrying that thing.  Yeah.  But it kept them away, you know, as far as the six days I was there, but he was around there. 
[02:32:30]  We heard him.  That was scary enough.  When they picked Africa, I know I remember reading, there were a lot of, like, violent people in the area  that didn't want Survivor to be there, and there were threats made that...  Some of the people were going to be hurt or something.  Do you have any of the people treating you badly or trying to get in and sabotage the show?  No, not at all.  It was in a pretty seclusive area, and we didn't see any of it.  If there's anything, it was probably before we got there. 
[02:33:00]  But once we got there, it was pretty much tight, tight security.  Yeah, because I remember that, yeah, they had to, like, clear it out, and they got a lot of security there.  Because, man, that's some crazy stuff going on there.  You can try to go to sleep, and you wake up, and someone's hacking at you with a machete.  Yeah.  Kind of scary.  I don't know.  I wouldn't have gone.  Nick, what's going on?  We're talking to Jesse from Survivor Africa.  Hey, guys.  But then again, I wouldn't go on the Aerosmith roller coaster.  There you go.  Nick.  You said, I'm a pussy.  Hey, well, I was just wondering how she fixed her lips.  Because last night, I saw the show. 
[02:33:30]  It looked like she's about 24 hours on the corner.  What?  Her lips were all crusted up, man.  Oh, you had some chapped lips.  Is that with the chapstick thing?  Yeah, the lips.  Yeah, they were actually looking a lot better on the show than they actually did.  They were really bad.  Just chapstick.  And actually, once I got water into my system, because I hadn't had water for four days,  the lips kind of got better on their own, believe it or not.  The water just kind of healed them up.  Too much.  I don't know.  Hold on a sec. 
[02:34:00]  Better you than me.  I can't deal without television.  I need a couch.  And I need a...  Pump pilot.  And laptop.  Right.  Beer.  Computer games.  Tommy.  Yeah.  You're a cop?  Yes, I am.  All right, what's up?  I'm working right now, actually.  Okay.  I was just wondering if she wanted to trade any tactics, you know?  Maybe we could get together and, you know, do some cop work together.  You dick.  She's rolling her eyes at you, you tool.  She could show me some of the Orlando tactics.  I could show her some of the Brooklyn South ones. 
[02:34:30]  You're a cop?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  These are our cops.  Yeah, I know.  You're a cop, obviously.  Oh, this is NYPD.  I guarantee this is NYPD.  And I'm proud of Tommy.  There you go.  NYPD.  All right, Tommy.  Right on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, have you met with any of the NYPD?  No, I haven't.  I'm actually...  I got in last night real late, and then today I've just been doing the tour, so I haven't  gotten a chance to meet anybody.  You will be in for a surprise.  It's probably a little different than Orlando's police department down there. 
[02:35:00]  I'm starting to see that.  Some of the guys around NYPD, they're a great bunch of guys, though.  They really are.  Has Playboy called to do the whole police angle?  No, they have not.  No?  No.  They haven't called you yet?  No.  Oh, come on.  No, come on, guys.  Just don't cop their jobs when they do that.  Well, not only that, but that would not help me in any way.  Right.  I'm going to go to law school, be a judge someday.  Am I going to be the judge Playboy bunny?  I don't think so.  It's one thing to be in Playboy.  It's another thing to be in, like, swank. 
[02:35:30]  No way, dude.  Playboy's got the class.  Playboy's the same thing.  You're still naked.  A little classy, though.  You know, it's swank.  You can see what the people have for lunch, if you ask me.  Playboy's a little classier.  It's more artistic.  You know what I mean?  Plus, I just can't see anybody walking up to my dad and going,  Look, your daughter's on Playboy.  See, and that's why you're not on Playboy.  You have a great relationship with your dad, right?  No way.  There you go, see?  She doesn't want to get back at her dad.  You need those girls that have some kind of a bad relationship with Pops.  Sal, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to know where Seclusive is. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, stop.  Now you're getting picked.  I'm just screwing around.  I'm just picking a little bit.  All right.  Thank you.  Jack tool.  Keith the cop, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, if she wants to check out what goes on with the NYPD,  off the, give her my cell phone number, we can hook her up with a ride around.  Yeah, no surprise here.  Actually, Keith is a great guy.  And if you ever did want to take a look around Manhattan with a NYPD.  Actually, that sounds great.  I would love to do a ride along with NYPD if I could. 
[02:36:30]  That's not a problem at all.  You know, she could do that.  All right.  Hey, Keith.  All right, Keith, hold on the line.  Okay.  He's one of our friends.  He's a great friend of the show.  Is this really Kimmy?  Kimmy.  Hey, Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, that's Kimmy, all right.  I'm back.  Survivor 2.  Remember Kimmy?  Hi, Justin.  Hi, how are you?  I'm fine.  I just wanted to say you did a great job.  Enjoy everything that you do. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Yeah, babe.  I'm asking her, do you remember Kimmy from Survivor 2?  And she's like shaking her head, no, I don't know who the hell that is.  Crying that loud.  Remember her?  She didn't want to eat the big worm until she got back to Long Island.  Then she couldn't keep them out of her mouth.  I know.  They were attached to men.  I know she sounds like Fran Drescher.  Just, you know, we get through it.  Now, here's a girl, Kimmy, that was on Survivor and was not afraid to take her clothes off for anything.  She took them all for us.  For us.  For magazines. 
[02:37:30]  For Kevin James.  It didn't matter who it was.  Various married football players.  It didn't even matter.  Hey, let me tell you guys, if you guys even knew my list now, you'd be so proud of me.  Are you banging more celebrities now than even before?  You don't remember, Kimmy?  I'm so kidding with you guys.  But listen to me, I missed you guys on the road show on Wednesday night.  Hey, Kimmy, it's not about you.  It's not about you.  No one cares about the, you know, Survivor 2 cast.  We're on Survivor 2.  We're on to Survivor 3. 
[02:38:00]  I know.  I know.  But, Jesse, I want to tell you, you did really good out there.  Eh, enough of her.  Thank you.  Our 15 minutes of fame is over now that you guys are the big deal.  Poor Kimmy.  These reality shows, people got to realize that.  Here's a little reality click.  No one cares about the cast of Survivor 2 now.  Poor, poor Kimmy.  It's true.  You guys are horrible.  It's true.  No, no.  We're nice.  I remember never to call back after S4 comes out.  No. 
[02:38:30]  Who's that chick from S3?  Nobody cares about you.  Bye-bye.  I knew she'd think that.  Jesse, you know what's sad?  She's actually a friend of ours, and that's how we treat her.  She's right out on Long Island, so we know her.  Kimmy's the best, yeah.  We know her well.  We just want to blow her off so we can spend more time with you.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You have a website?  Do you?  No.  No?  Then what the hell is Rick giving me?  Somebody else will put her up.  Uh-oh.  Oh, really?  Is that what happened?  Jesus Christ.  Probably SaveEddie.com.  That's all.  What's on there, Rick? 
[02:39:00]  Is it?  Yeah, there's pictures of her in bikinis and all sorts of things.  In bikinis.  Really?  Yeah.  Let me pump that up.  Well, that's her Survivor Africa shots, but...  From the show.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  We're almost done with the show.  We'll finish with Jesse next.  Can you hang out, or are you disgusted?  All right.  And we'll also play...  What did we learn on the O&A show today?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at the 9th... 
[02:39:30]  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at...  I was surprised she's going to be crazy.  Should I just say my name?  This is Ozzy Osbourne...  I don't have to, no.  She's going to answer in something.  W...  W-4.  Oh, f***ing nuts this morning.  I'm getting a f***ing book to read.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  It'll be Opie and Anthony on The Rock Stadium.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:40:00]  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports Guys, Blaine and Craig.  Morning, Don and Mike.  Midday, Opie and Anthony.  Afternoon, Ron and fans at night.  We are 1027 WNEW.  And we're back with Jesse from Survivor, Africa.  We just have a few minutes left in the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  She was just telling us she was going to be on Regis.  Regis?  Monday morning. 
[02:40:30]  Does he watch Survivor?  Survivor 3?  No.  Regis?  I don't think so.  He doesn't watch TV.  He never seems to know much about the pants on his show.  You're from...  He's watching the TV on Monday.  You're from Survival?  Is that like he'll get it wrong or something like that?  So I hear you with the fire department.  He'll probably get the wrong tribe.  Yeah, he'll do that.  Oh, yeah, if he even knows about them.  Right.  He won't even know.  Gelman, help me with these things.  They'll get all mad at Gelman or something.  But it'll all be fun. 
[02:41:00]  All nice and fun.  Kelly will be cool.  And she'll be up on Survivor.  Kelly's cool, yeah.  She knows stuff.  She's like Regis' crutch, pretty much.  So make sure you pay more attention to her.  Just let Regis go,  My God, what an attractive woman you are.  You know, and you say thank you,  and then look right at Kelly.  Kelly will completely save you.  She'll help you out.  Yes.  So future plans,  you say you want to be a judge or something like that,  so you're just going to stay with the department  and not try to get into show business. 
[02:41:30]  A lot of people that get into the Survivor things  and then reality shows want to get into show biz.  Yeah, you know, right now I'm not back to work yet.  I'm going to wait until the end of this show.  It's kind of open right now,  but I can go back anytime after,  before actually June 30th of next year.  Yeah.  I'm just waiting.  I'm going to do a little bit of traveling  and enjoy my time off.  Yeah, I got to say it.  I think they're going to talk you into getting in Playboy.  I just feel it.  I don't feel it on this one.  I definitely don't see it.  Why not?  They might make the offer.  You see the pictures on the website? 
[02:42:00]  It's very attractive,  but I don't think she's going to go for it.  No way.  Got too much to lose over here.  Most of these people,  why did you get into it?  My sister sitting right next to me  was the one that got me involved into this.  Really?  She's a Survivor fan.  Yes, definitely.  So you wouldn't have pursued getting on this show  if it wasn't for your sister then?  Yeah, I don't think I would have.  Yeah.  Because like I said,  a lot of the people that do get on,  they want to be actors,  they want to be on TV,  something like that,  and think it'll be a good springboard 
[02:42:30]  to movies and television.  That's been working, huh?  And it just seemed odd  that you have a career, you know,  and you're very happy with it.  I thought Colleen did a great job  in that movie, Animal.  Better than Rob Schneider.  He sucks.  We can't stand it.  Well, does Jessie's sister want to be in Playboy?  No.  No?  No.  Man, you girls were raised right.  Yeah, what happened?  How the hell did they get on this program? 
[02:43:00]  Usually the girls are the horror stories  of their upbringing  that can't wait to rip their clothes off.  Oh, no, no way.  Yeah.  Well, they're getting completely disgusted  that we're even bringing it up, Anthony.  That's all right.  All right.  No, that's not true.  Hey, we've got to give away  a Samsung DVD, VCR combo unit  and Boogeyman DVD.  Okay.  Between now and October 31st,  when you buy a Samsung DVD player,  you get three free movies, Ant.  How about that?  Visit SamsungUSA.com 
[02:43:30]  or JNR Music World for details.  It's all brought to you by Samsung.  We're going to give that away  very, very soon.  All right.  Well, we want to thank you guys  for coming by.  Your sister didn't say anything, though.  Did you want to say something  about your sister?  Did she look good on the show?  I think she looked great.  Did she represent her?  Yeah, definitely.  I was very, very sad.  I was crying last night.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I really wanted her to go far.  When did you realize  that she got kicked off?  Last night.  Come on.  Last night.  How do you hold that from your family? 
[02:44:00]  Nobody knew.  You know, when she came home,  she said,  don't ask anything.  The only thing I want to know  is what she wore.  I went to the mall  and we bought all the stuff  for the show.  She bought all kinds of stuff  and she just got to wear  maybe two outfits.  So I was like,  what did you wear?  She's like,  we don't get to pick  what we want to wear.  But she didn't even tell me that.  All right, hold on here.  So you're from Florida.  Right.  Orlando.  Didn't you know something was up  when all of a sudden  she said,  well, I got to take a plane ride  to New York? 
[02:44:30]  No.  No, no.  You didn't know  until you saw it on TV.  Until I saw it on TV.  So what did you tell your family  that you were just taking off  for a day or two?  Interviews.  She's had interviews.  I have interviews for her.  I just kind of looked at her.  We were lying in bed  and I just kind of looked at her.  Oh, come on.  Oh, wow.  Like that?  Look, they're disgusted.  It was a little joke.  It's just funny.  We're tools.  And when girls talk like that,  we're just like,  oh.  It's a joke.  You made Anthony turn red.  That's not easy.  No, we're lying in bed. 
[02:45:00]  It was a small bed.  No, I'm kidding.  I just kind of looked at her.  Tell me more.  And I was crying.  I would just cry.  I said, oh, man.  I thought Kim was going to be  the one to get the boot.  So she comforted her then.  Definitely not her.  She comforted her crying.  Yeah, we kind of hugged.  You're trying stupid.  I would have kept you around.  Yeah.  I definitely think  she's a strong girl.  I mean, that's why  I was like,  you need to go and do it.  I can't believe  she didn't tell you, though.  That's like, jeez.  By the way,  I got kicked off.  I got kicked off.  Don't tell anybody.  But the fun part  is seeing, you know,  everybody's reaction 
[02:45:30]  and the whole thing.  I mean, I know  what was going to happen  and I was still watching  like, oh, my God,  what's going to happen?  You know?  And I thought,  wait a minute.  I know what happens  on this show.  Why am I worried about it?  Maybe the vote will be different  and they won't kick you off.  I know.  Oh, wait.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Maybe CBS will edit it wrong.  Wait, okay.  Not a chance.  That's me.  All right.  Well, good luck  in any of your future endeavors,  which I know  don't include  posing nude  and Playboy Opie.  No.  Sorry, Anthony.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  We have to end the show.  I mean,  I could talk to you guys forever. 
[02:46:00]  So why don't we give  the Samsung DVD,  VCR combo unit  and Boogeyman DVD  to a random caller right now?  We'll go with the 20th caller.  How's that?  Right.  Everyone,  have a great weekend.  Yeah.  Don't forget  the boob-o-lantern contest  starts Tuesday.  Did you have to bring this up  when they're in here  disgusted already?  You guys want to know  what the boob-o-lantern thing is?  Yes, I do.  What about...  Look at this.  Okay.  Ben's going to kill me.  We've got to get it off the air.  But basically,  we're looking for girls  with breast implants 
[02:46:30]  to come down  and what happens is  if they get naked  and then you put flashlights  under their boobs, right?  Oh, my God.  And you turn off  all the lights.  They glow.  It's the coolest looking thing.  And they glow like pumpkins  on the front porch.  Yeah.  And it doesn't work  with natural boobs.  It's just because the implants  with the clear fluid in them,  it just makes them light up.  It's amazing.  Oh, we've got to try that.  Yeah.  Ooh.  You know anyone with implants?  You don't have the breast implants.  No.  It's not going to work.  Let me...  Aw, you'll have to come back  when we do it.  All right.  There's a picture of a girl  doing it on opiananthony.com.  All right.  And all the details 
[02:47:00]  for the contest are up there.  Okay?  Cool.  We've got to look that up.  Have a great weekend,  Jessie and sister...  Raysa.  Raysa.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming by.  We'll see you guys  Monday at 3.  Cock.  Cock.  Opie.  Cock.  Cocking out of one's butt crack  Anthony.  Is a sign of personal confidence.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This show will really  give you brain damage.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh! </pre>
