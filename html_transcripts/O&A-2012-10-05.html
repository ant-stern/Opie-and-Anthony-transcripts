<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually explicit banter, immediately setting a highly irreverent tone.  This segued into a discussion of the Obama-Romney presidential debates, with Opie describing his enthusiastic, almost sports-fan-like reaction.  They speculated on the upcoming vice-presidential and subsequent presidential debates, mentioning debate formats and dates. Opie mentioned attending Hofstra University.  The conversation then turned to Ann Coulter, her controversial opinions, and the online reactions they provoked, leading to a discussion about the blurred lines between opinion and fact in political discourse, particularly regarding race and gay marriage, and perceptions of "phoniness" amongst white people discussing race.

Next, the show delved into Bill Clinton's presidency, his affair, and his testimony, using audio clips.  The hosts analyzed Clinton's debating and lying skills, contrasting them with Obama's perceived reliance on a teleprompter.  They also compared Biden's and Ryan's communication styles, and briefly fact-checked Reagan's age at the time of his election. Al Gore's explanation for Obama's perceived poor debate performance (citing Denver's altitude) was debated, with the hosts sharing their own altitude sickness experiences.

The show then shifted to the release of a Hulk Hogan sex tape on Gawker.  They discussed the tape's content, speculated on the identity of the woman involved (possibly Bubba the Love Sponge's wife), and mentioned another man in the video who seemingly gave consent.  The hosts speculated on the circumstances surrounding the tape and compared various celebrity reality shows, contrasting "The Osbournes" with "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," and mentioned wrestling reporter Sam Roberts' familiarity with the tape.

A significant portion focused on the potential for a reality TV show about the Opie and Anthony team.  They contrasted Ant's suburban lifestyle (helicopters, nighttime flights) with Opie's city life and family.  They highlighted the personalities of their colleagues, including Roland (described as a "weirdo") and E-Rock, as potential material for the show.  Ant detailed his helicopter experiences, including near-misses and nighttime flights that made it look like a UFO.  Jimmy's sleep apnea and overcoming a fear of flying were also discussed.  The segment included discussion of technological advancements like self-landing helicopters with cameras, transforming motorcycles, and exoskeletons. Bob Kelly was mentioned as a future guest.

The next segment covered exoskeleton leg braces with cameras, contrasting new technology with traditional methods.  A significant part focused on a Martin jetpack, its cost ($120,000), and potential uses (including a sexually suggestive one).  A video of a remote-controlled helicopter with a crudely fashioned penis was shown and discussed at length.  Kurt Schilling's financial troubles and the failure of his video game company, 38 Studios, were also discussed, along with the game *Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning*.  "Jocktober," a segment showcasing other radio shows, featured clips from "The Bob and Sherry Show."  Comedian Colin Quinn called in, briefly mentioning a disappointing experience without elaborating.

A later segment centered on Jim Norton's cryptic tweet about a "most disappointing night," relentlessly teased by the hosts and Colin Quinn (who was now in the studio).  Norton eventually revealed it was a botched photo opportunity.  The discussion included Quinn calling Norton "superficial," along with numerous vulgar and offensive jokes from all participants, touching on topics like body fluids, sexual acts, and racial slurs.  They further mocked a pre-recorded Bob and Sherry segment about waiting times, and discussed news stories about teenagers, incorporating racial slurs and offensive generalizations. The segment concluded with more crude jokes and a promotion for Mike Tyson's daytime TV show.

Another segment began with a vaguely suggestive conversation about a host's new girlfriend and photo restrictions, quickly devolving into explicit descriptions of masturbation and cleanup.  The conversation then shifted to pornographic actress Gage.  The presence of studio guest Kelly triggered a highly sexually charged interaction with Anthony, filled with sexually explicit remarks, discussions of infidelity, and offensive ethnic stereotypes. Anthony's personal life and relationship were discussed in detail.  Upcoming guests (Johnny Rotten) and appearances were mentioned, along with off-color commentary on James Bond films.  Various sound effects and interjections from crew members (Jimmy and Chip) contributed to the chaotic atmosphere.

The final segment highlighted a female guest, Kelly, from a previous show with Patrice O'Neal and Colin Quinn.  They recounted a humorous anecdote about Kelly's apprehension about meeting Patrice, followed by graphic descriptions of Patrice's perceived sexual behavior and fantasies involving Kelly. The hosts joked about Patrice's short attention span and memory, and gave detailed physical descriptions of Kelly.  They discussed getting tickets to Colin Quinn's Broadway show, Bobo's attempts to contact Kelly, and promoted Kelly's stand-up shows and the hosts' book releases.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flasherent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn to the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Tie these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise! 
[00:01:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I like that little...  What's the best part of this?  The little hi-hat.  Fuck all that siren-y sounding stuff.  Hi! 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, my voice is a little raspy still.  It was that fucking Yankee game out in the rain, I think, that did it.  Did it to me.  And the fact that I was treating the debate like a sporting event.  Yelling.  I was yelling, booyah, every time Romney got a good jab in there.  Booyah!  Real loud on the compound.  I was a maniac.  It is a sporting event, though. 
[00:02:30]  Nothing's getting accomplished.  It's a sporting event.  It's just a sporting event.  But it worked.  I mean, it was...  A lot of people watched, apparently.  Most watched debate since 92.  With George Bush Sr., Clinton, and Ross Perot.  A lot of people watched that one.  And then a lot of people watched the other one.  Which they're saying could make quite an impact in those swing states.  Because Romney looked pretty goddamn good.  When do they meet again?  When do they meet again? 
[00:03:00]  Maybe for coffee?  I don't know.  Oh, no, no.  I meant in the political arena.  Oh, the next debate.  When is that?  October 11th?  What?  Thursday.  Thursday?  Oh, I'm busy.  I'm sorry.  That's a vice president.  Is it a town hall meeting?  Oh, that's vice president?  Yes.  Well, that's going to be pretty exciting, too.  The 16th is a town hall format.  Ryan and fucking Biden going at it?  That's on the 11th?  The 11th...  No, the 11th is not town hall.  The 11th is vice presidential foreign and domestic policy in Kentucky. 
[00:03:30]  And then the 16th, which would be...  Which would be the 16th?  Tuesday.  Oh, I'm busy.  A week from Tuesday.  Oh, Jesus.  At Hofstra University.  Right on Long Island.  My alma mater.  Is that your alma mater?  Yes, it is.  You went to Hofstra?  I went to Hofstra.  Hey, how was that going across the highway there?  Did you make many trips over there into Uniondale?  I would go to the subway across the street, like the subway sandwich shop, and that's 
[00:04:00]  as far as I would go off-campus without a car.  If you ventured a little further south?  If I would go right out of the campus, no, no, no, no, no.  That got a little treacherous.  Would you carry the Jets' athletic supporters?  Yes, the Jets work out over there.  They used to, yeah.  Yeah.  Joe Biden's got to get his shit together.  Joe Biden and Ryan, I don't know.  I'm thinking this could be another one for the old Republican side.  Biden's sharp and stuff, but he comes off like a loose cannon. 
[00:04:30]  You know, he really does.  He could say anything, that guy.  And Ryan seems to be very, by the book, another one of these like Romney numbers guys, kind  of got his shit together.  Are these guys really religious conservatives?  They're not like Bush religious.  No, I don't think so.  I really don't think so.  It's not that important.  I don't know.  I don't know.  A lot of people were very angry at Ann Coulter yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  It's amazing to me.  Why?  I was reading Twitter and, my God.  And somebody goes, why don't you admit that Ann Coulter was wrong about the gay marriage issue?  I go, there's not a right and a wrong.  It's her opinion.  Yeah.  You dumb motherfucker.  I told her I didn't agree with her.  I think that you should be able to get married if you get married.  But it's like, you're right.  It is an opinion.  There's no right or wrong when someone goes, I don't agree with that gays should be allowed 
[00:05:30]  to get married.  That's not a right or wrong issue.  It could be to you.  You might think it's wrong.  But again, that's just your opinion.  But her opinion is that she's not for it.  There's no, you can't calculate why it's good or bad or right or wrong.  So people got mad at that.  They just, and then some dumb bitch was calling us like we aren't qualified to even talk about  politics.  Like we shouldn't even be allowed to discuss it because we don't agree with her. 
[00:06:00]  And of course, she's some fucking socialist black woman.  Of course.  Who cares what she thinks?  She's very upset.  She probably didn't like, she probably didn't like that there was white people talking  about race in a way that she didn't agree with.  That is exactly it.  And that's what happens.  By the way, that's what happens when you get so used to talking to people who are white  and afraid to be honest with you.  Yes.  That like, if I agree with you, I'll say I agree with you.  If I don't, I'll say I don't.  And it's like some, some black people have forgotten that a lot of white people are phony in 
[00:06:30]  front of you.  Right.  Yes.  They're phony.  We don't, we don't sit here and say horrible.  Like we joke about horrible things.  When we talk about race, we don't say terrible, outrageous things.  No, not here on the air.  No, of course not.  Only the privacy of our own homes and whispering in your, in your movie theater.  We locked the door.  Yes.  And our meetings.  Yes.  Imagine if this country was, and we play our favorite list game.  A lot of black people don't know why people are full of shit in front of you.  They're a bunch of phonies.  And yeah, she, she wasn't used to the fact that people disagree with her and talk about 
[00:07:00]  race.  It's very, everyone gets so nervous talking about race.  Oh boy.  Oh, no, just fucking spell it out.  Talk about it.  Cause they're afraid that something about themselves is going to be revealed if they say the wrong  thing or if they agree with the wrong point.  That's the way most white people are.  White people are phonier about race because they're more afraid that I'm going to say  the wrong thing.  Yeah.  And then they're going to know that I secretly locked the door whenever one of them walks 
[00:07:30]  by secretly.  I swing my hand around like fucking like Hulk before he cups his ear.  Fuck it.  I'll actually, I actually, I have a little sign I hold up.  It says locking doors now.  Yeah.  Twitter was all abuzz about that and us discussing the, discussing the debate.  And she gets that reaction from people. 
[00:08:00]  People just hate her.  Yeah.  They love her or they fucking hate her.  Yep.  But she didn't say anything outrageous.  Like for Ann Coulter, I thought she was fairly subdued.  Calm, pretty calm.  It's, you can't disagree.  Politics is so weird these days.  You can't disagree and have a discussion without it turning into some kind of, you're  either a racist or you're against the poor or you're, uh, you know, dividing against  the wealthy and that it's just, you can't just discuss it anymore in a civilized manner. 
[00:08:30]  It just turns into fuck you.  You're an asshole.  Go suck his dick.  Oh, all right.  And people are like, her laugh is so fake.  It's really not.  I know her alone.  That's exactly how she is.  She's, she likes dirty humor.  She's, she's really not fake.  Whether you like her or hate her, that's who she is.  And it also amazes me that, uh, a lot of women give her shit and it's like, there's,  that's the epitome of what you want a woman to be.  Not backing down, very strong minded, has her own opinion. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Self-made, you know, shit like that is, but they just bash her as being some fucking shill.  And meanwhile, she's, look, I don't agree with, I probably agree with maybe half of  what she says.  The other stuff is just too conservative.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not the way I go.  I'm socially very liberal about most stuff.  Yeah.  She's too conservative even from my liking with a lot of issues, but you know, that's her opinion.  That's what she likes.  That's how she wants things run.  That's, uh, that's her.  And I love watching her argue with people. 
[00:09:30]  Like, it's like, yeah, why, why?  I don't agree with her on a lot of women's issues even, but you know what?  If you're a woman, why, why wouldn't you at least admire the fact that she fucking never  backs off people and she's, and she's bright and she makes smart, she never argues like  Whoopi Goldberg did.  Like, oh, you, you don't understand because you're not black.  Pure emotion.  Yeah.  Oh, that Whoopi clip is infuriating.  She had no idea what she was mad at.  That's what's irritating. 
[00:10:00]  She couldn't just go, ah.  Yeah.  Like, you remember that fucking clip of, what was his name on Fox?  The cowardine.  Were they, were they accusing, he was accusing the Fox News of getting this black woman in  trouble because they mentioned her name and they said, well, we didn't technically mention  her name until after she was fired.  Right.  He was a hundred percent wrong.  And he goes, and he was just fumbling to be right.  And so just say you're wrong.  Fucking dummy.  Yeah.  Just sometimes that's the best thing to do.  Oops.  Whoops.  See, Romney came out last night. 
[00:10:30]  Oh no, did he?  He said he's gay.  Yes.  Fucking know it.  He likes peckers.  My mother said anybody with meat hair likes peckers.  Chipper.  Chipper.  He was, he was saying that that 47% line that caused so much controversy said in a campaign  where you're giving hundreds of speeches, you're going to say things that are wrong.  You know, you didn't mean to say it in the way it was said and that.  And he goes, yeah, that was, that was wrong.  And he said, you know, people make mistakes. 
[00:11:00]  That is so refreshing.  Holy shit.  And it's smart because Obama didn't bring it up at the last debate.  Right.  So now if he brings it up at the next one, Romney would be like, I already said it was wrong.  Diffused.  Yeah.  I said it was wrong.  Why would you even bring it up?  And it's great that on the heels of a big victory like that with the debate, he's able  to make up for a mistake without it being pounded like, oh, look at him.  He's a mistake making motherfucker.  Yeah.  Because he killed in the, in the debate.  So really good timing. 
[00:11:30]  I think he's on, I think he's on a pretty good track right now, Romney.  If you really think that Obama is unbeatable at this point, you're being very naive.  Yeah.  I think he looks very vulnerable.  Yeah.  Because in, in four years ago, he probably wasn't because, uh, people were sick and tired  of, people hated Bush at the end.  A lot of people hated Bush, that which is what hurt McCain.  And he picked someone that reminded people of Bush, an arch conservative, uh, who people  didn't feel was qualified to be there.  Right.  Mentally.  Yeah.  That's pretty much, uh, Obama had everything going for him four years ago. 
[00:12:00]  Everything.  And this time around, I mean, he, he, he literally couldn't look up when the economy was being  mentioned.  He, he, he seemed embarrassed by the fact that under his, uh, guard, um, the economy just  has been shit regardless of where it came from.  Like, oh, you know, be inherited Bush.  Yeah.  He inherited, but he said, you know, I'm going to fix this.  Hey, watch me fix this in four years.  And then four years later, it's like, eh, I need eight. 
[00:12:30]  I need eight years here.  I've only done one term.  Come on.  One term.  There was also, it's something like you have to have confidence in the president.  And he didn't really seem like he could talk without the teleprompter.  It was really, he was bumbling.  I feel like when he was looking down, he was writing and writing and writing and writing  so he could have, like, he needs his ideas in front of him.  The teleprompter.  Yeah.  On his proxy.  Yeah.  Because he wasn't that sort of, that guy, whoever he was like, listen to this guy talk. 
[00:13:00]  The fiery speech, the, you know, very, uh, energetic.  He should just wear a teleprompter hat where it's like a big hat and it's just got a big  teleprompter on the end of it on the bill.  Somebody's just in the back typing to it.  In the back typing and he's just like, and I think, and I just, whoa, he's good.  Yeah.  He's great.  He looks silly.  That's why Clinton was so good at the DNC because he wasn't even going with the teleprompter.  He had it and he was like, fuck it.  Off the cuff.  Well, we all know Clinton's got game.  Clinton was masterful.  That guy can fucking talk.  That guy can talk.  Dude, he fucking, he looked into the cameras. 
[00:13:30]  I did not have sex with, oh, you beautiful liar.  Was he adamant?  Oh, was he adamant to just, I did not have sex with that woman?  And then he reiterates, you know, not ever, not one, not, I did not.  Oh, oh, sex.  Now, hold on.  All right.  All right.  Let me, let me, it's so.  How long ago is this?  I'm going to say this again.  Oh, boy.  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.  I never told anybody to lie. 
[00:14:00]  Not a single time.  Never.  Never.  These allegations are false.  Oh.  He's crazy.  And I need to go back to work for the American people.  He's such a liar.  He was lying.  By the way, there's cum on the dress.  Let me address that.  Yeah.  That was before fucking the old load dress popped up.  You think he lies to Hillary a lot?  Oh, God.  That is just a guy caught cheating.  That's right there.  Every guy lies like that. 
[00:14:30]  He became every man right there.  You have to be the fucking chairman of the board when you're lying to a chick.  I absolutely did not.  I deny it.  Yes.  I categorically deny.  Which one is this?  When he asks what the definition of is is.  Oh, yes.  Mr. Blitman.  Backpedaling.  More backpedaling, by the way.  That was a long clip.  Yeah.  That's why I didn't put it on the air.  Just to see the president sitting like that and just being interrogated about fucking a chick. 
[00:15:00]  Amazing.  That was an amazing time.  But you kind of need a guy that can be that good on his feet.  Like they can just come up with some lies if he needs to or whatever.  Don't you want him going to another world leader and have the ability to look him right in the eye  and say, nope, we are not putting missiles there.  Yes!  I never said I was.  Not ever.  Yeah.  And then missiles end up there.  Just convincing him everything's cool.  Don't even worry about it.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  No problem.  Whereas Obama would be like, yeah.  We put some missiles down.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Clinton was a masterful liar.  A masterful bullshitter.  When he would bite that lip.  Kind of squint a little.  Get that thumb going.  I feel your pain.  I feel your pain.  God, was he great.  Is he able to run as a vice president or no?  I don't think so.  You know what?  There's, I read something that there, it's, it's so never happened that no one really is sure of the ruling there. 
[00:16:00]  If he were somebody's vice president, it wouldn't matter who the candidate was.  He would win.  Without a doubt.  And he would also, although he would also be, no, no one would want to be president over him because of who he is.  You just could, he would dominate.  Just alpha male the shit out of the White House.  You know?  He's a, oh boy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, that's swagger.  How old is he?  He's not that, what is he, 64, 65? 
[00:16:30]  I would think, yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, okay.  Because I mean, he was a, he was a, 66.  Oh, he is 66.  He might be, he's getting up a little older.  66.  Well, I mean, there have been old presidents.  But I'm saying.  Oh, four years.  How old was, how old was Reagan when he first got elected?  Because one of the huge selling points, well, against him was the fact that he was so old.  72?  I'm guessing totally.  During his first term?  Wow. 
[00:17:00]  I don't, I don't know.  Let me, let me see.  60.  Look up Reagan, age, elected, Google.  72.  I see 68, 72, and question marks from the same guy.  You're an asshole.  That was the year.  All right.  He was born in 1911.  Yes.  And he was elected in 1981.  69.  70.  70?  70.  When he first fucking took office.  Well, you know, I was voted boy most likely to guess the age of an older man in high school  two years in a row.  Very good.  A lot of experience. 
[00:17:30]  I think we have a clip of Al Gore.  Yeah.  Al Gore, it's amazing to watch Democrats scrambling to make excuses for Obama's horrible showing  of the debate.  There's been quite a few excuses they've made.  But Al Gore is a very creative one.  He never used to say stupid shit when he was vice president, right?  No, he said a lot.  He said a lot of stupid shit.  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was on current TV? 
[00:18:00]  Current TV is hilarious.  It really makes MSNBC look like fucking fascist TV.  They are really, really hard to the left.  Isn't Oberman suing them, too, for $50 million?  Yeah.  I think he is.  I heard that at least.  Oberman.  Yeah.  So this Al Gore on the Young Turks.  Oh.  What's the Young Turks?  It started as like a YouTube news show.  Yeah.  Super, super liberal.  And then Current TV picked it up. 
[00:18:30]  Oof.  I'm going to say something controversial here.  Obama arrived in Denver at 2 p.m. today.  just a few hours before the debate started.  Romney did his debate prep in Denver.  Pause real quick.  When you...  If...  I have not heard this.  If this...  Fatso fucking massage board dummy mentions the altitude, 
[00:19:00]  I'm going to fucking spit coffee on myself.  Uh-oh.  You see, because the ball jumps right out of the park,  so the home run stats can't be counted,  field goals go 75 yards!  Don't tell me he's going to mention the altitude.  Oh, boy.  In Denver.  Mm-hmm.  When you go to 5,000 feet...  Exactly.  Uh...  And you only have a few hours to adjust...  That's interesting. 
[00:19:30]  Uh...  I don't know.  That's interesting.  Maybe kind of...  Drating it out of the...  Can I say the first time...  To me, just one real good thing here.  I just came from L.A. the same day.  You know what I did?  I drank two cups of coffee before coming out here.  No, no, it's different, Jake.  I wish he had a drink of coffee or energy drink.  It's really different.  The first time I ever did stand-up in Denver,  I had the same exact effect.  I flew in that day, and when your lungs aren't acclimated  to that kind of air...  John Fugel saying?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It makes you drawn.  It makes you off.  That's interesting.  The president had an off night.  Holy moly.  Is it really the altitude? 
[00:20:00]  Probably not when you're the president,  but I will agree with Fugel saying that  the first time I did stand up there, too,  you really are fucking disoriented.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Honestly, you are.  And I know I'm contradicting myself  that the bashing Al Gore,  but then again, I'm sure Obama has spoken there before.  They had the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver,  so I do believe he was there,  and he was very fiery, 
[00:20:30]  and it seemed to be very nice.  That's one of those things  that the president should kind of be able to work through.  Yeah.  Like an altitude change shouldn't be a game changer.  I think he's been to Denver a few times,  probably not really acclimating himself to the altitude  and still performing.  Yeah, he's able to speak.  Yeah.  Form a coherent sentence.  And I don't know if I want a president  that can't fucking,  can't operate at a certain altitude.  Yeah.  You know?  What if he's in Denver  and needs to make a decision? 
[00:21:00]  You know, that was...  Whoa, I'm a little woozy.  That was a terrible excuse,  and then the more I'm thinking about it,  the more I'm like,  Voss fucking had to be taken to the hospital  to get oxygen in Aspen.  And you are a little loopy up there.  I will admit,  I did go to Denver,  and I was in Aspen.  It was very difficult to even walk  from the condo to the jacuzzi. 
[00:21:30]  You kind of do get a little loopy,  but that being said,  I mean, I'm certain  that has to be taken into consideration.  And if he didn't think of it,  that's a bigger problem than anything.  How about you think of it?  Yeah.  How about you think that,  wow, that altitude,  I might look a little loopy.  Maybe I should get there a little early  and acclimate myself to this altitude  like Mr. Romney did. 
[00:22:00]  It was all...  It's not the fact...  The weird thing watching Obama,  like in those clips,  I didn't see the whole thing,  the clips I saw,  was the way he was just kind of like  looking down and looking distant.  He looked out of sorts  in a weird way.  Like he's...  Very weird.  I mean, when Romney was addressing him  and just rattling off stats,  Obama would just kind of smirk,  shake his head a little.  He'd glance up for a second  and then look back down  and like not really addressing... 
[00:22:30]  He was being just lambasted by Romney  and he wasn't even really addressing it.  It was very much like  he didn't have the information.  Like he had the highlights  because he'd be like,  this is what Romney says.  And Romney's like,  no, that's not what I say at all.  And then Obama didn't have the information.  The follow-up stuff.  To prove, yes, you did say it.  He was just like,  oh, okay, you didn't say it,  you didn't say it.  By the way, Aspen's 8,000 feet.  Denver is 52, 80, something like that.  That's a big fucking difference.  Yeah.  Man, so if Voss fell down in Aspen, 
[00:23:00]  had to be taken to the hospital.  8,000 feet is a lot worse than 52 at 8.  Yeah, that is true.  Yeah, yeah.  Aspen is fucking rough, man.  You really got to spend some time  just fucking chilling for a while.  They should do it on top of Everest.  They should helicopter them in  on top of Everest  and make them stand there  with fucking pointy, spiky shoes and talk.  There's a fucking Sherpa next to you.  Yeah.  Do you know how fucking hard 
[00:23:30]  that idea would be to pull off?  Yeah.  Very hard.  Yeah.  Very, very difficult.  Especially since you can't get  a helicopter up there.  You can't, right?  No.  How high do they go?  No.  Helicopters, 10 feet.  That's as high as they can go.  Oh, you see,  I was always under the illusion  they went higher.  That's as high as they go.  I'm surprised more people aren't injured.  The air's a little thin up there.  Oh, is that why they can't?  Yeah, the air gets a little thin.  Very hard to hold things up  at that altitude  unless you're a jet airliner  going pretty quickly. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Because that would be great  if they could just get  a helicopter up there.  Imagine you climb Everest  and then it's like,  oh, you just get picked up  by the helicopter  and fucking come back down.  You don't have to climb back down.  I would get dropped off  and then I would just film myself  go, look what I just did!  And then I had the helicopter  to come get me.  That's another thing  people would do.  There'd be so many pictures  of people on the top  of Everest  because you could just  get dropped off up there.  Yeah.  And fucking, hey, look at me.  Look at me now.  JBL made it to the top  of that mountain.  He was climbing.  Did he?  What mountain was it again? 
[00:24:30]  Mount Kilimanjaro.  Yeah, Kilimanjaro.  Who's JBL?  He was in here  when David Tao was in here.  Yeah.  Were you here that day?  I don't think Jimmy  was here that day.  He's climbing all the big peaks  over there in Europe.  He's a wrestler?  Yeah.  You've met him.  I think Cowboy Hat?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's a fucking...  I was very nervous for him  because I heard the...  There was a plane crash  in Nepal  and it was full of people  that were going to climb Everest.  Oh, wow.  And I know we were talking  about Everest  and talking about mountain climbing. 
[00:25:00]  I was like, oh...  Imagine that.  You're going to fucking Everest  to climb.  You're worried about fucking,  you know, getting up there  and not dying on the mountain  and then the plane  that's taking you there  crashes?  It's like an Alanis Morissette song.  Ah.  American Airlines  having problems  with those fucking seats.  It's fucking amazing.  I had seat issues with them.  Did you?  Yeah.  What happened, Jimmy?  Well.  I was... 
[00:25:30]  I love self-absorbed Jimmy.  I was going to Los Angeles.  Jimmy gets on one elbow  and leans toward you  to tell you,  well, let me explain this one.  Like, because he needs  all your attention.  I was...  I was saying  before I was so rudely interrupted,  Carrie almost got so annoyed at me.  And he really did.  Before I was so rudely interrupted.  He said you should be  put on his sedative  with his weird  American English accent.  Yeah, he was all right.  I think he thought  I was fucking with him 
[00:26:00]  and being a dick.  I think he did.  That was why I kind of didn't...  I wasn't a prick to him  because I'm like,  I think he's just misreading me  because...  Thanks for your service.  Yeah.  It wasn't one of those situations.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  But I was on my way  and when I...  If I do the little show,  you may know  it's the Tonight Show,  ladies and gentlemen.  Oh.  Johnny Carson.  Yeah.  If I go out there  and I do the Jack Parr program,  they fly me first.  But it's not because I'm pot shits  because I think it's probably  just a union contract.  Sure.  Everyone doing that is flown first. 
[00:26:30]  Nice.  And they deal with the airline.  They pay like a quarter.  But I was in the seat.  There was a major...  Five cents.  That's great.  Yeah, which was amazing too  because I had 50 cents.  I'm like,  upgrade my friend!  But the seat,  they tell me right before the flight,  the seat was not operational.  Wow.  So, and when was this?  How long ago?  Probably two months ago.  See?  And this was just coming out now.  The seat was not operational.  That's in first class?  It wouldn't go back.  It wouldn't do anything.  They said you have to...  There's no tray table 
[00:27:00]  and you have to sit straight  for the whole flight.  And they said the seat number  was like 2D,  which is the middle seat.  Double D.  Yeah, fucking double D.  It's like big tits.  My mother's got big fucking tits.  What?  She'd always say,  Chipper, where's my big bra?  Or as I call them,  I'll stop them from flopping.  Sexual.  Hey, Chipper,  where's my over-the-shoulder  boulder holder?  So fucking...  So I'm...  And that was the same seat  I had had a problem with  coming back one night, 
[00:27:30]  2D,  where I was sitting there  and the massage thing,  they have...  These are really older planes.  Oh my God.  It's not nearly as fancy  as I'm making it sound.  They have a massage option,  but it doesn't feel good.  It feels like there's a fucking...  It feels like there's an infant  in your seat  kicking your back.  Like, that's the massage.  Yeah, they kick  like a little massage.  But that's what it feels like.  And it kept happening  the whole flight.  It would just go off.  That's creepy.  And I couldn't push the button  to stop it.  I told the guy,  there's a fucking ghost  in my seat.  So I was so mad at them  because they had the same problem 
[00:28:00]  with the same seat  which I had addressed.  So I talked to the woman  about it before I went on the plane.  They had to downgrade me  to business class,  which like, look,  business class is fine too.  But they told me  those seats weren't operational.  I had a problem  in two business class seats.  Like, yeah,  the leg things aren't working.  I don't like the idea  of anything on a plane  that's electric  that isn't working.  Because to me,  it just,  all I picture  are two wires  in some fucking conduit  somewhere  up in the overhead  that are rubbing together  going...  Oh, you mean  for the three or four months 
[00:28:30]  like probably a year ago  when I was flying American  where you couldn't  plug your laptop in  because the electrical system  wasn't working?  See, that shit  is the scary thing.  It was a long-running problem  so they downgraded me  to business  and the seat that I was in  was supposedly  like the leg rest  didn't work.  So the seats  have had problems there  and the American  handled it really,  really well.  Like, they gave me  a travel voucher.  They were very nice about it.  But I was like,  this is fucking  three seats in a row.  Jesus,  what's with the fucking  seat problems?  What the fuck?  Get new planes! 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, so apparently  when they go to take off,  these seats  are just coming  out of the floor  and flying backwards.  One of them  flipped over  the front of another seat  that was behind them.  It's just,  you're sitting in your seat  and you have to fly backwards.  Oh, crazy.  There were people  in the chairs?  Yes.  And it was flying back?  And the seat flew back.  Yeah.  Right into someone's lap.  I'll tell you,  that's a fucking,  that's a free flight somewhere.  Oh boy. 
[00:29:30]  That's a travel voucher.  That would have to be.  For a lot of people.  Very,  very scary.  Are they the 757s  or 767s?  757s, I think.  So they go through  the whole process  of making sure  everybody knows  how to connect  their seat belts.  Yeah.  And the seats  are not secured  to the floor.  The seat comes apart.  Older planes, man.  They pulled 48 757s  out of service  to make repairs.  I was on a 767  of the ones  I had problems on.  Really?  Check them too.  Well, I was on a 777.  I have never flown  one of those. 
[00:30:00]  I never have either.  I just wanted to one up you.  No, no.  I don't blame you  because I'm looking  at the 787.  Your turn.  797.  Wow.  Now, beat that.  Yeah.  It does get scary  when you walk into a plane  and you look around  and you're like,  oh, there's ashtrays  in the armrests.  Yeah, that's the worst.  Oh boy.  I don't like an old plane.  What was it  when we were coming back  from maybe either Chicago  or Cleveland?  Yeah.  And there was that old plane  that didn't even have  monitors in the seats. 
[00:30:30]  It still had monitors  in the ceiling  when it came down.  A lot of them.  Yeah.  A lot of them in United.  That's bad.  Yeah.  That Virgin American  was amazing.  It's like you're walking  into a club.  They had fucking  blue neon lights  over the windows.  Very subtle,  nice atmosphere.  Brandy new fucking plane.  Sometimes newer planes,  though,  there are times  where they'll use,  where the engines  are brand new,  but they'll use  older interiors.  They don't just  throw seats out. 
[00:31:00]  No, they mix and match  a lot of shit.  Look at that fucking,  that is a great looking plane.  When you walk into that,  it's like,  ah, it's the future.  Hawaiian Air  was like that, too.  Was it?  Yeah.  When you went  on your honeymoon?  That's right.  Not first class?  No, it was Coach,  but it was still like that.  It had the lights  and everything  in the ceilings.  It was nice.  Did they bring you  champagne  because you were  newlyweds?  No, I think Coach.  Coach, so no champagne.  Oh, right.  Coach.  Coach class.  What's that like?  I mean, it's fine. 
[00:31:30]  It's nice.  When you don't know  any better, it's good.  I vividly remember Coach.  You do?  Yeah.  You know what?  Coach isn't bad.  Is that goddamn,  I gotta say JetBlue.  JetBlue isn't bad.  I mean, it's just...  JetBlue's great.  I like the fact  that they will shove  entertainment right in your face  no matter where you're sitting  and it kind of gets you  through the flight.  And it's cheap.  Yeah.  And their entertainment's free.  Like, I always...  I don't care about  the cheapness of it, Travis.  And it's not as cheap  as you think  because a lot of times  JetBlue now,  other flights  are a little bit cheaper 
[00:32:00]  than JetBlue.  They've gone up, man.  It's not as cheap  as it used to be.  Where you're out.  Where I fly.  But I always fly JetBlue  and I'm used to  the TV being free  and everything.  And then we get on United  to go to Cleveland  and I start watching TV  and then the flight takes off  and it says,  if you want to keep watching TV,  it's going to be five bucks.  What, do you got to put  quarters in the seat in front of you?  It's just you get used  to these things  that other airlines  offer for free.  There really is  such a disparity  with what one airline offers  as opposed to 
[00:32:30]  what another one offers.  And even the same airline,  what they offer  from plane to plane,  from flight to flight,  it's willy-nilly.  There's no rhyme  or reason to it.  Like JetBlue,  you check a bag for free  and then we go to Cleveland  and it's like $15.  I don't know.  I'll bring it on.  Well, that's why everybody  now is doing carry-on  and fucking taking up  all the overhead  with their giant  doesn't fit carry-on shit.  Wait, JetBlue,  they used to not have  a free...  They needed the money!  Oh! 
[00:33:00]  No, not that kind of blow, Anthony.  Oh!  Oh, guys.  I think they used to not have  a frequent flyer program  and now they do.  They do.  Yeah, they have like  true blue points.  Yeah, I think they used to not  and they have no first class  but don't be surprised  if they come out  with a plane  with first class eventually.  They don't have first class  but they have what they call  like even more legroom seats  which are really...  That's a very long thing  to call something.  Yeah.  Even more legroom seats.  Economy plus, they call it.  Economy plus. 
[00:33:30]  That's how I fly sometimes.  Economy plus.  And it is enough space.  It might not be enough  for distinguished gentlemen  like you  but for me it's a big...  I flew JetBlue.  If you can get...  If you can somehow get  three seats  if you get to buy  the middle seat  sometimes that's cheaper  than flying...  They're doing very well  because apparently  they're expanding  over JFK.  They're expanding  their terminal.  Yep.  So yeah,  they're one of the airlines  that are actually doing well.  Americans still in what?  Bankruptcy protection?  That scares the fuck  out of me too 
[00:34:00]  when you fly an airline  that's in bankruptcy.  Yeah, all the other airlines  are either bankrupt  or merging with each other.  Yeah.  And JetBlue's just like...  Americans fighting off  a takeover from U.S. Air  right now.  I mean, it's...  U.S. Air?  I know, that's what I said.  Who the fuck wants  to be taken over by them?  That's what I said.  I couldn't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Yeah, you get on the planes  and you're thinking,  you know,  are they springing  for that really good nut  and bolt?  Yeah.  Or are they going  for that discount nut and bolt? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, the good maintenance  or the fucking...  Yeah.  Are they paying  the best fucking maintenance guy  that's really going to  make sure things happen  or the guy that doesn't  turn the fucking bolts  very tight on the seats?  The thing about  the pay TVs, though,  because Hawaiian Air  also had pay TV.  Oh, boy.  But then you remember  that if you just open your bag,  there's an iPad  with nine movies on it  that you could just watch.  You know, you kids,  you fly and think that way.  Back in,  I like to refer to it as  the day. 
[00:35:00]  Oh.  We didn't have such luxuries  as this portable televisions  that you cart around  with yourselves.  Right.  We had to sit there  and read a magazine.  Or look at the movie  they had on.  Right.  Which was carefully edited.  Oh, my God.  They were horrible.  I don't know how many times  I went across country  watching Little Man Tate.  Little Man Tate?  Or Kramer vs. Kramer.  Oh.  What makes a woman  a better parent?  Simply by virtue of her sex.  Oh, very good.  Good movie. 
[00:35:30]  At the end,  Meryl Streep realistically  gives Billy back.  Yeah, sure.  Because that's what happened.  That happens.  Was that Dustin Hoffman?  Do you know,  she said that we were  talking about this,  this is what a good actress  she is,  and she really is.  That's great.  She always has a secret.  Going out on a limb there,  aren't you, Jim?  Yeah, I say.  Meryl Streep, good actress.  But I say the edgy things.  That's why I'm on this show,  because I take the dangerous risks  while all of you run around  and say,  Meryl Streep,  who is she?  I say,  no, no, no, trust me.  She's good.  This kid's going to go far.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  But she always has a secret  about her character  that no one else knows,  and that's how she makes her  have more depth.  Yeah.  Secrets.  Yeah, minus that I have  size nine and a half shoes.  I got crib bar marks  on my legs.  I'm making a bunch  of great actresses  with secrets.  The top of the crib bar  hit my pubis.  Pubis.  My pubis.  Oh, great pubis.  Yeah, the fatty part  of my pubis.  Now I got to urinate. 
[00:36:30]  And in her,  her secret with Dustin Hoffman  was that she never really loved him,  that she never really wanted  to get married or whatever.  She had this really weird secret  when she went into the role  that she didn't tell anybody.  It's such an odd thing to do.  It's like, it's a role.  You're playing a character,  but the character has a secret  that you don't tell anybody.  Then is it really anything?  Yeah, but how do you...  It's the old tree falling  in the forest.  Oh, oh.  What the fuck is that?  Kenny?  What the fuck? 
[00:37:00]  Somebody, what do you got me  on the Pay No Mind list, kid?  That is the weirdest thing.  Kenny is meticulous  with everything he does.  That's right.  He's come in...  By meticulous,  we mean incompetent.  He has two breakfasts  in his hands.  That's right.  Only two for me  and the lovely Jim Norton.  That's right.  Come in a blue cup  and come in a red cup.  He put mine down  next to Jimmy  and they're not even similar.  Yeah.  Anthony gets a sandwich  and I get eggs. 
[00:37:30]  What's that, sweetie?  He's off his game, Kenny.  Yes.  Really?  That's not a normal mistake  for him.  No.  You know why?  Why?  He misses Greg.  Oh.  He misses Greg.  You think so?  He doesn't know what to do.  He's not getting the Pop-Tart.  He's not getting cereal.  He's not getting the milk.  You need anything SR?  It doesn't feel the same.  He's not getting blueberries.  Did he name his daughter?  No.  Opina.  Opetta.  Or Opetta.  I forgot.  How could I forget?  I like Opina.  Opetta Gregoria Hughes. 
[00:38:00]  Opetta Gregoria Hughes.  What a beautiful name.  Opetta Gregoria.  He called me.  Opetta Gregoria.  I'm sorry you have Opetta Gregoria.  I don't have to operate.  He did call me yesterday and confirm  he did go with Opetta Gregoria.  That's great.  That is fantastic.  So he said,  little Opetta Gregoria  is doing really well here.  Opetta.  That's great to hear.  What do you call that for short?  What do you call Opetta for short?  Ope.  Ope?  Ope.  Or Ope.  Yeah.  Ope. 
[00:38:30]  Because now Ope is too masculine.  Ope.  Ope.  Come on.  Ope.  Ope.  Oh, yeah.  I love this.  By the way,  I will talk about it later.  Stupid Nicki Minaj.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fucking.  I just looked at the headline  of the Daily News.  I fear for my kids.  What?  Can people shut the fuck up?  Are we saying that Mariah?  Yeah, enough with her.  It's fake.  Of course it is.  I think this whole thing's a work, man.  Of course it's a work.  You know a work.  It's all worked.  And E-Rock knows a work  because he writes them  in his fan fiction. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, his aren't as intricate.  WWE fan fiction.  E-Rock had that right, though,  where fucking the Hulk  pins the Iron Sheik  with his thermos-like cock.  Yes, we were watching  before the show started today  Hulk Hogan's sex tape.  This thing is unbelievable.  What a big dick.  He's got a giant,  what has been called on Gawker,  a thermos-like dick.  Yeah, that's right.  That's what made me happy.  People were tweeting me.  Why did that make you happy?  And what a rod he had.  He's an older man,  but I'm telling you,  steroids haven't fucked his dick up at all. 
[00:39:30]  Turgid.  Tumescent?  Really tumescent.  He probably ties a little bandana around.  That's the little Hulkster.  The little Hulkster.  Yeah, but imagine that,  a little bandana around the head of his dick.  Yeah.  And a little shirt that he rips off of it  when his penis gets all thick  and the shirt rips off.  Yeah.  That's why there was an empty seat at Wembley.  It was for his cock.  Wembley!  What'd you think of the tan lines  on his butt cheeks?  Oh, yeah, you'd expect that.  He tans.  He does tan. 
[00:40:00]  But not in the nude.  No, not in the nude.  And now he's,  this is weird,  a camera looks to be in the ceiling somewhere.  Yeah.  Perhaps one of those  smoke detector cams or something.  Right.  It's night vision-y,  black and white.  It's a good camera, though.  Good cam.  And he's,  the girl's on the bed.  Oh, yeah.  Now, apparently,  what is the rumor here  on this,  on this tape?  What's the story?  Sam Roberts, 
[00:40:30]  our wrestling  reporter,  you know about this.  Yes, yes.  Very much.  I watched it very many times.  Hulk.  Oh, my God.  That thing was down to his fucking  mid-thigh.  Yeah, he's got a big one,  which is great news  for wrestling fans everywhere.  He's six foot seven.  I mean, you'd hope so.  Anything else would be unfair.  But the rumor is,  based on what the girl looks like,  it looks like  Bubba the Love Sponge's wife.  Wow.  That's who it looks like. 
[00:41:00]  Those are serious allegations.  And there's somebody  at the beginning of the tape  that is permissing Hulk Hogan  to do what he's going to do,  to say,  go do your thing,  I'll be in the office.  So some guy is saying,  here, fuck my wife.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, he's not,  I don't think he says  that it's his wife in the video.  Oh, really?  He's just saying,  you guys do your thing,  I'll be in the office.  I'll be in the office.  That voice, to me,  to me, that voice sounded like Bubba. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  And are other people saying this,  or is it just you?  No, a lot of people are saying it.  No, it's actually,  I was actually,  I actually,  her name is Heather Clem.  Yes.  Which is a terrible last name.  Well, that's Bubba's last name.  Yeah, you know, I know.  Bubba Clem.  But it sounds like,  here it says,  Hulk Hogan sex tape,  and it said that,  it's a rumored,  it said a long,  a leggy brunette doesn't appear,  the grainy half hour video,  it was sent anonymously to gawker.com, 
[00:42:00]  which is that they're shopping,  and it's rumored to be  that of the Hulkster,  and a woman named Heather Clem,  the ex-wife of his best friend,  Bubba the Love Sponge.  That's, you know,  another unseen man exiting in the video,  tells the couple,  do your thing,  I'll be in the office if you need me,  before exiting.  And it's hard to say  if it sounds like Bubba,  because I've only heard Bubba on air,  I've never heard him just kind of talk,  so,  I don't know if that's what his voice is,  but at one point,  oh, the cell phone,  okay.  But if,  who would have sent that out? 
[00:42:30]  Like,  it's obviously taped without the Hulk's knowledge.  Right,  it looks like a security cam.  I don't know if the girl,  he's not addressing the camera at all.  Does the girl know it,  or does she not know it?  Well,  I would,  if the girl is indeed Bubba's wife,  she would know there was a camera in there.  Maybe.  Because it's her house,  you would think.  You don't know that though,  because if you are,  like,  that's the ex-wife,  and now it came out,  and is she saying it's her,  or no?  What is she saying?  she hasn't.  Someone could have put a very covert, 
[00:43:00]  you know,  smoke detector cam or something,  up in the ceiling,  and staff,  like a staff member of the house or something,  or the guy,  without even telling the girl,  or the wife,  or whatever,  whoever she is.  And maybe he would jerk off to it,  or maybe,  you're pissed off now,  you got something,  you want to release it.  But why would you do that to,  that doesn't make sense,  they're friends,  why would you do that to Hulk and Bubba?  Hulk and Bubba are good friends,  and,  I think,  to my knowledge,  Bubba has gone on Howard's show,  when he was still married to this chick,  and said that he lets his friends fuck her.  Really? 
[00:43:30]  I believe that he said that.  He said that?  I believe so.  Did he say,  kind of half kidding,  and like,  oh,  but then it's true,  it's true.  It wasn't even,  it was more like,  you know,  the thing was,  oh,  Bubba,  you're like a real man,  like you do this,  and Bubba's like,  yeah,  this is my lifestyle,  I'm crazy,  type of thing.  But,  yeah,  I mean,  you know,  it's all,  what do you think it looks like,  what do you think it sounds like?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  this is all speculation at this point.  I can never have a friendship with a guy fucking my chick.  Oh my God.  In the video, 
[00:44:00]  Hulk Hogan says,  I'm gonna put my Bubba shirt back on.  Yeah.  Now,  if you were just fucking some random chick,  why would you say that?  Why would you be like,  hey,  I have a Bubba the Love Sponge t-shirt,  I'm Hulk Hogan.  The only thing we know for sure from this video is Hulk has a massive cock.  And Gawker calls the full 30 minute video a goddamn masterpiece.  And the other thing you're talking about,  the cell phone,  is that he's about to get blown by this chick. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  And his cell phone goes off,  and it's his daughter's song.  That's his ringtone?  Playing on the phone,  yeah.  Ooh,  how fucking,  ugh,  that's creepy.  He's going to pick up the phone with his dick and ass cheeks hanging out.  And it's his daughter's song.  And it's his daughter's song playing.  It's just a weird,  Where's my daughter?  It's good to be Hulk Hogan.  Well,  as long as he got that giant dick.  Everybody was assuming,  I think that,  you know,  with the steroids and everything,  and your big guy,  little dick,  that whole thing. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But,  wow,  he proved that wrong.  And he always used to imply on his reality show,  you know,  and who knows if it was fake or not,  but on his reality show,  the thing was that his wife wasn't fucking him.  Like,  that was one of the stories on the Hogan Knows Best show.  Oh.  And by the way,  maybe Hogan needed to go out and use that massive piece of his.  The big,  the,  all the best stuff happened around,  without the reality show there.  Yeah.  The divorce,  the fucking,  the,  the,  the true fights,  her fucking,  him riding his dumb,  uh,  the boat was in there, 
[00:45:30]  right?  Yeah,  the boat was in there,  where he was crying.  The porn on tape,  all this shit that happens,  though,  like,  without the reality show.  Great,  good job.  But instead,  they were spending all their time setting up phony,  like,  ridiculous scenarios.  Yeah,  it got real shit in there.  It's more interesting.  Yeah.  What was the name of that?  Oh,  Hogan Knows Best.  Hogan Knows Best.  I like the show.  How many years was it on?  I hate those shows.  It was on for like,  three or four years,  and then Brooke got a couple seasons herself.  Was it?  Yeah,  I mean,  it was a,  it was a,  it was a hit.  I hate the, 
[00:46:00]  the celebrity reality shows.  They're,  they're terrible.  They're all the same.  The fucking,  and the Osbournes were groundbreaking,  funny,  real.  Uh,  but then you get like,  really?  Do I really want to see Tony Braxton's fucking family?  Who gives a shit?  And the other thing is like,  Ozzy is legitimately this character.  Like,  he's an interesting guy.  Yeah.  To have on television.  Whereas the other celebrities aren't.  No.  So you have to create,  Yeah,  create drama and,  yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Like,  I don't think Ozzy's thing was fake.  Like,  I don't think things were set up on Ozzy's reality show.  Sharon said it,  and she said it publicly,  and she's also said it privately.  There's never,  she said we never did a take two.  Yeah.  There was no take twos.  It was all what you saw.  And she said that in regular conversation.  Now,  now,  obviously when there's a camera in your house,  there might be certain things that you do differently.  Of course.  But,  but I,  I don't think there was staging stuff is what I mean.  Yeah,  no.  I remember when the Osbournes came out,  and it was like,  nobody even understood what it was by the commercials. 
[00:47:00]  They're like,  wait,  it's the real world,  but with famous people?  Right,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  This doesn't make any sense.  And then you got the fucking Kardashians who,  I don't even know what that is.  Like,  like,  the show comes on,  and,  and after the show's over,  you don't even know what happened.  No.  Like what,  they walked around,  went shopping,  and talked about their fucking dumb boyfriends.  It,  there's nothing,  no substance to that show whatsoever.  But they're just walking around going,  oh my god,  and making these dramatic,  like, 
[00:47:30]  for that show,  they don't even create situations.  There's no situations.  Nothing happens.  But they're being very dramatic all the time.  Yes.  Yes,  talking like,  uh,  I like the sister that doesn't even have any emotion.  That,  uh,  Which one is she?  The hot one,  right?  The little one?  Yeah,  yeah.  Um,  the little one,  whatever the fuck,  but she's just,  Courtney.  Courtney.  I don't,  I don't know,  where's,  where's my boyfriend,  husband,  whatever the fuck he is.  That drunk.  I don't know what they do.  Like,  I don't understand,  because to me, 
[00:48:00]  they're not very interesting.  No,  they're not.  And there was like the episode where like the whole,  the whole,  uh,  uh,  storyline,  the arc of the episode was that stupid Chris Humphreys threw Kim Kardashian in a pool and she lost her diamond earring.  She's crying.  I lost my earring.  Why would you do that to me?  Why would you dump me in a pool like that?  Right.  And it's like,  this is the episode.  That's like the teaser.  Like when we get back from break,  you'll see.  that's what you're going to see.  Holy shit.  Oh,  the Osbournes,  uh,  this is the first episode. 
[00:48:30]  Oh,  was it?  Yeah,  that's,  uh,  this just seemed like this was real.  Do you believe this was fucking 10 or 10 years ago?  What?  It was a decade ago.  Is that how long ago this was?  It really was a foreign concept when it came out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like it made no sense to have celebrities being filmed.  Having a,  who's that?  Pat,  uh,  Pat Boone singing that?  Uh,  opening it with like credits like they're fucking actors. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was so weird.  It's like,  oh,  we're going to like look into their,  we're going to look into their lives a little bit.  And everyone watched it.  Yeah.  I've driven by that house.  Did you?  Yes,  I did.  On purpose?  Of course.  This is before I was invited over.  This is when,  oh,  well,  this is when they were moving in.  Different house they live in though.  Oh,  they do.  That was up in the hills in Beverly Hills.  Yeah.  Doesn't Christina Aguilera or somebody own it now?  Yeah.  I think other reality shows have used it.  Really?  Yeah.  You know,  VH1, 
[00:49:30]  when VH1,  if you look at those shows,  when they were doing like flavor of love and they just had show after show after show after show when they were on that run.  Yeah.  You could look at the house.  It's all the same house every time.  Is it really?  Like they got a house for the surreal life,  which was the first like kind of flavor,  flavor reality show thing.  Yeah.  Every show is done in the surreal life house from different angles.  Oh,  they just kind of move the,  the establishing shot,  put different colored lights in things,  make it look a little different.  It's like on sitcoms where you can tell that the stairs are always in the same spot because they're all using the same sets. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They always use the same house.  Was it like for the,  the,  the bachelor and things like that?  It had to be because they obviously built it for reality shows because they have bedrooms for like infinity people.  A shitload of people.  Yeah.  It's probably cheaper to rent that house out than it is.  Yeah.  I should make my house a reality show house.  I think you should too.  That would rock.  How great would that be?  God.  You could do a reality show.  I really have thought about it,  but boy, 
[00:50:30]  that is really taking your privacy and just throwing it completely away.  Turn this off because it's going to make me want to watch Ozzy.  I know,  right?  All I want to do is look at Ozzy.  Watch it.  We're talking Ant and me are looking at each other because Jim is just staring at the computer.  Jim is just watching the Osbournes.  He's just watching the Osbournes.  It's cool.  You should do a reality show.  When I was thinking of that, it really would be fun, but wow.  This whole radio show should do a reality show because there's so many different characters.  So many different.  Your life and Opie's life are so different.  So amazingly different.  And the whole thing that pulls it all together is the show. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  So you show some stuff with the radio show, and then the rest of the show is just us and what we do with our lives.  You're just a drunk with guns on the table building helicopters.  Building helicopters.  Opie's running around filming homeless men on the sidewalk for no reason.  And then has his kids.  Jimmy's out doing stand-up and traveling and perhaps getting a little relaxation, as they call it. 
[00:51:30]  Fighting crime.  Fighting crime.  How funny would something like that be?  Out of nowhere, something like that happens.  A golden moment.  And all of your lives are very different.  Like Sam and I mean, you know, Sam is married, Travis is married, and Iraq is married.  But I mean, all these interesting characters we have around.  Yes.  And I was pushing for a while to get it done.  I mean, I would love to.  And now that we're, you know, we're signed, we have to get something like that going. 
[00:52:00]  Not just a fucking camera here in the studio and, you know, okay, what guest is coming in today?  Here's that.  Like that's been done.  Of course, Howard's been doing that for years.  But more of a what do we do after the show?  The show is the unifying thing.  But then what do we do after?  What do we do on the weekends?  You know, that kind of shit, I think, would be hilarious.  And you get the basis of the show.  It starts in the studio because we have enough celebrities in here and enough fucking weirdos and creeps that come through.  Right.  Where that's a part of the episode. 
[00:52:30]  And you show us just doing what it is we do.  And between all of us, there is absolutely enough to make an interesting 30-minute episode of fucking week.  And everybody thinks they're fascinating.  Like we all think that we're interesting enough just to follow me around with a camera.  But the reality is there's enough differences in the people here, especially you and Ope because your lives are just so, you know, him with the kids and the wife.  Darkly different, yes.  And he lives in the city and you're a fucking creep on your lawn. 
[00:53:00]  It's a funny couple of different lives that come together to make this show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we come together and do the show.  And then, yeah, he's with his kids.  Meanwhile, the island in my kitchen right now.  I have an amazing kitchen.  The island is there.  Granite Island and stuff.  It is right now covered with wire, wire cutters, helicopter parts, batteries, battery charges.  It looks like Al-Qaeda has taken over my kitchen.  It looks like something is going on there that is not good. 
[00:53:30]  That's clean, by the way.  That right now is clean.  I was stripping wires and soldering last night.  I was soldering camera equipment.  You have too much free time.  So I could down, I have a video downlink system so I could see what the camera sees from, you know, two miles away.  It's going to be winter.  This is summer activity.  No, it's good in the winter, too.  It is?  Yeah, that thing will fly like a fuck in the winter.  Last night, I may have, I may have had a couple of vodkas in OJ. 
[00:54:00]  Some beverages.  Couple of beverages.  The maybe is that there was OJ involved.  He's not sure he poured orange juice into it or not.  And I thought it was a great idea at 10 p.m. to loft the helicopter way into the sky in front of my house.  And there I was on my front lawn.  With lights fucking, the thing looks like a UFO. 
[00:54:30]  It absolutely does.  And then I, I, I like hid behind one of the bushes because the neighborhood security guy was driving around.  And then I just lowered the helicopter right in front of his car.  I have it on video.  See, this is the show.  This is the show.  This is the show.  And then I, he makes me his butler.  It, uh, yeah, it was, I, I was hiding.  It's 10 at night.  I'm hiding behind a bush.  Taunting the neighborhood watch security guy with the helicopter that has a camera on it. 
[00:55:00]  You get us a bit, a bit of a bigger studio to set up for.  Right.  You have the in-studio cameras that are really good.  And there's absolutely a way to do this.  The problem is, and this, and this is the entire problem.  There's too many, too many different, not different people involved, but there's too many different individuals.  The reason Stern is able to get stuff done is because it's him.  Like he'll say, I want to do this.  And it's just one guy making the decision. 
[00:55:30]  Yes.  Here there's two guys, which makes it harder because one guy has his life.  One guy has his life.  Both are very busy.  And then you have to go through management and then you have to go through the agent.  Right.  There's just a lot of people as opposed to one person's easier because they can say yes or no in an instant.  And it's either done or it's not done.  I absolutely want to get this going, though, because it's such a unique idea.  It's also something that not everyone can do.  You need something going on.  You know, you can't just, like you said, everyone thinks they're compelling. 
[00:56:00]  They're compelling.  But when you put all of this together, it does become a funny, compelling, very huge contrast between all the characters kind of a thing.  I would love to do this.  Okay.  We got to get that going.  Be awesome.  Pitch it.  Well, I happen to have a very good relationship with a couple of people and a certain, uh...  Yes.  A certain...  Yes.  You know what?  Let's set up a meeting.  Okay.  I think that the first step is always the meeting. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Something I never thought I'd ever say.  The first step is the meeting.  Yeah.  Believe me.  If you knew, my heart is just smiling.  Even though you mean something else, at least you don't mean Klan Rally.  Well.  But yeah, let's...  Let me check my calendar.  There's enough...  There's enough stuff...  Yeah.  ...that I think it would be interesting.  Oh, absolutely.  You don't have to force it.  Because again, we have enough people coming in here.  Between all the comics that we know...  Yep.  ...and all the fucking guests that we get. 
[00:57:00]  Because Roland gets amazing guests for us here.  Well, even like...  Do you know how hilarious the little one-minute, two-minute E-Rock and Roland segments would be?  Yeah.  See, that's another thing.  The shit that goes on here when we're gone.  Like, filming Roland acting like a maniac in the office, which he does every single day.  Now E-Rock has been posting some of the pictures on Twitter.  And it's hilarious.  You have no idea.  There's wrestling matches going on.  There's people fighting. 
[00:57:30]  Roland apparently had his foot up on the desk yesterday.  I just saw the tweet.  It's like, well, Roland apparently didn't know he has dog shit on his shoe.  He's just sitting there with dog shit on his shoe.  Roland...  He climbs up on furniture when you guys are gone.  I don't know.  Like, not even in his office, in the public hallway.  He's up on top of desks.  Roland's a weirdo.  Roland is a weirdo.  Last week, he had his Indiana Jones outfit.  He's walking around with the whip, snapping it at people in the hallway.  You know what he does when he gets stressed out?  What?  He blows up cans of club soda. 
[00:58:00]  What?  He takes cans of club soda.  Yeah.  And he throws them as hard as he can at the floor to watch them explode.  You should see the carpet in our office where the ink is coming off the carpet because of all the club soda.  It's just smeared everywhere.  It's a strange guy.  Oh, boy.  Maybe it's a club soda was smeared everywhere.  I got my hopes up.  And then E-Rock doing his day-to-day stuff that he doesn't realize is funny.  Oh, God.  Please.  You know? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  It's fucking king of the interns.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Why don't we eat?  And I definitely want to get into a little jocktober today.  We skipped it yesterday.  Do you have a good one?  Yeah, this is good.  Yeah?  The one from yesterday we'll do today.  It's good.  Yeah, we kind of skipped...  Our guest is here.  All right.  We have Snob Kelly coming in.  Snob Kelly.  Now, why are you calling him Snob Kelly?  Because it rhymes with Bob. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, I thought he did something mean and snobbish.  No, no.  He's as white trash as you can get.  He's involved with Cheat, right?  Yes.  The book's out, I think.  Is it out yet?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I saw Tweety pictures of a big box with the books in it.  Well, I mean, we have a big box of books in the office.  Of Cheat Braggers.  Really?  Yeah.  I want a copy.  It comes out Tuesday, I think. 
[00:59:30]  Books always come out on a Tuesday.  One of my stories are in it.  Oh, stories.  Yes.  All right.  So we'll take a breaky and we'll look at maybe a little jocktober when we get back.

That would be some weird Matrix shit on purpose. 
[01:00:30]  Repurposed.  Nice.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  What does that mean?  A new purpose?  But a repurpose means you're purposing it again.  The repurpose has a new purpose to what?  Originally had a different purpose.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose. 
[01:01:00]  Wait.  Alright, let's break it down.  Re-use.  So you use something and then you reuse it.  So it's not a new purpose.  You're using it for the same shit.  Purpose is sounding weird now.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  We're taking audio that at one point had a purpose and adding a new purpose to the same 
[01:01:30]  audio.  Now we're repurposing that same audio as to be a song.  Well there you go.  There's the repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Serious.  XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. & Anthony Show.  Yeah, rock.  I have no idea. 
[01:02:00]  Hi.  O.P. & Anthony Show.  We're being joined right now by the lovely and talented Mr. Robert Kelly.  Hi.  Hi, Bobby.  Hi.  Wow, he's stroking Jimmy's arm.  I'm giving the reverse.  That's nice.  There's a lot of it.  It's comforting.  It really is.  I've outgayed Jimmy a couple times.  Yeah.  A couple times.  Not too many times.  I'm too tired so I would be impossible to outgay now because I'm just too tired to move.  Yeah.  Did you sleep well, Jimmy?  Everyone is always very concerned about your sleep. 
[01:02:30]  It's terrible.  Is it terrible?  Yeah.  You wear that mask.  No, I know.  I give it 10 minutes and I just can't get used to it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I can't.  Maybe, like, why does it have to be a mask?  Why don't they get, like, a deep sea diver helmet?  Oh, yeah.  One of those big pressurized things.  Diving bell.  Yeah, diving bell.  You'd need to be the Jimmy in the plastic bubble.  No, but then my nose would itch and I'd have to put it all the way up in the fucking thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's, well.  I just panic.  Like, I feel my heart, like, doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh, when I'm fucking get the mask on.  And when I doze off because, you know, of course, it's not the right mask, I'm sure. 
[01:03:00]  It's not the right machine.  It's just...  Then I wake up gasping in the mask because my fucking central apnea is kicking in.  It's so...  It's...  That sounds horrifying.  Yeah, but can't it be so...  Like, isn't it some of it psychological now that you're fucking yourself up?  Yeah, yeah.  The inability to fall asleep is.  I think so.  That's what messes me up.  You must think about it and just have anxiety about it.  The anxiety...  A lot of times, anxiety of things is the thought of the thing that makes the anxiety...  It's like that vicious cycle kind of a thing. 
[01:03:30]  So you have trouble going to sleep because you're thinking, I'm not going to be able to get to sleep.  And that makes the trouble to go to sleep.  It absolutely does.  I've been going to the gym every day, making myself more tired at night.  Yeah?  And that doesn't work?  Yeah, I am tired.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Sleepy.  I had that with flying.  I started developing a fear of flying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere.  And I just started thinking about it.  And I started thinking of the odds, you know, the more I fly and, oh shit, I'm doing this a lot.  I'm going to have to get into one of these situations at one point. 
[01:04:00]  Oh boy.  And then I started getting fucked up.  And then I tricked myself out of it.  I started saying the serenity prayer.  And it was like a...  Serenity now!  Poochie mama!  I got a little serenity prayer necklace thing.  And it helped me.  But psychologically, it made me stop thinking about it.  A takeoff and landing.  Yeah.  So now I don't have to do it.  I definitely went through the same thing with a fear of flying back in like the late 80s, early 90s. 
[01:04:30]  And then what snapped me out of it was the goddamn job going to get the radio job at AAF.  The first thing they did, the first week, was fly us out to Los Angeles to the comedy store to do interviews during the Oscar week thing.  And I had to get on a fucking plane.  This is like, all right, I'm going to blow this job because I'm fucking pussy and won't get on a goddamn plane.  Right.  So I got snotted drunk and stumbled onto that fucking plane.  And so it began. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, well, so it continued.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  And got on that plane and fucking did it.  And then the radio job, of course, took us all over the place.  And the more I flew, the more comfy I got with it.  But there were many years where I was just petrified of fucking flying.  Yeah.  And now, too, I mean, you know, looking in a mirror, I'm like, I don't care if I die.  Oh.  No.  Not that, but it...  Yeah, boo.  Get off the egg.  Oh, Edgar's just helping you.  He was emotional that time.  I don't like his baby fingernails. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, he was.  That was the most emotional I ever saw, Edgar.  Edgar was caring.  Oh, Robert.  I hate Edgar.  I fucking hate Edgar.  I hate the ball.  Yeah, the...  I got into a Chip YouTube fucking thing yesterday.  I couldn't stop.  An hour and a half of Chip just snapping on fucking Sam.  Fuck you.  Your mother's a fucking ass.  Angry Chip is great.  My favorite character of all time.  He just snaps.  Oh, he's just a cunt.  He's very angry.  Because I had the same thing. 
[01:06:00]  It was going to hurt my career, and I had to go out for an Aspen contest in, like, 95.  Oh, God.  Aspen is the worst to fly into.  Yeah.  It was Vale.  Before Aspen had a festival, it was Vale.  I mean, same thing, where you land in Denver, and then you take a small...  Oh, that small plane, yeah.  Aspen, you have to fly into, like...  There's, like, a window of time.  You're between mountains.  Yeah, and you have to fly in, and they cancel them all the time, and flights, they just shut  down at a moment's notice.  But I got over it, and now I'm very comfortable doing it.  If I fly, I read about it.  That's what helped me. 
[01:06:30]  I read the stats, and you think airline pilots, if I think I fly a lot, they do it every day  of their lives.  That's something you gotta...  You gotta kind of rationalize it that way, and I used to do something that was very odd  when I would go on a trip that I had to fly.  I would take some object in my house, and, like, a cigarette pack or something, and put  it on edge on a table, and then go, I'm gonna come home, and I'm gonna flick that over right  when I get home.  And it would give me this thing, like, I'm gonna do this. 
[01:07:00]  There's no doubt I'm gonna fucking do this.  And then I'd get home, and be like, I'd flick it over and go, see?  You did it.  All that is now in the past.  You did it.  You flew.  You got where you wanted.  You got back.  And that kind of...  Just the thought that I was going to do that and get home and everything was gonna be cool  kind of made it easier.  I talked to a pilot, too, once, and he told me how far the wings could actually bend without  breaking.  It's, like, crazy.  They just...  Almost 90 degrees.  Yeah, they can almost touch each other.  Did he mention that when you walked on the plane?  Maybe he was comforting the passenger behind you. 
[01:07:30]  Hang on one second.  Hang on, hang on.  I was gonna see what time it is.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The passenger behind him was panicking.  Don't worry, the wings can bend.  The whole plane...  Like, Frankenstein got torches.  Get him off the plane.  Yeah.  Fucking flapping.  The wings are flapping like a pterodactyl.  But, no, you...  I know you were gonna say something about my little technique.  I thought you had something in mind.  No, why would I comment on that?  I was just saying how great it would be. 
[01:08:00]  That works until the one time...  Yes.  ...when you hear...  ...and the engines shut off.  And then you're like, oh, I guess I'm not flicking that thing.  Oh, I'm not flicking.  Yeah, people go to my house to clean up my shit, and there's a cigarette pack on edge.  What's this all about?  They just throw it out?  Yeah, they just throw it out.  I never got to flicking.  Do they smoke them?  My little flicky pack.  I was on a plane with bad turbulence, though.  There's nothing more frightening than really bad.  Even though they say nothing could happen in turbulence.  You know what the truth of the matter is?  Not many planes have been brought down by turbulence. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  It really doesn't...  But it doesn't matter.  It's very scary.  When you're in the turbulence...  Yes.  I was with Pete Correlli on a flight.  Oh, good for you.  I remember we were in turbulence.  I was just sitting there praying, like every Catholic prayer I knew.  Wow.  It was going...  It was just slamming.  Like, everything was slamming.  That bang, bam, bam sound is like frightening up in the air.  Yeah.  And you looked around, and everybody has their eyes shut.  Some people were holding hands, and people were, like, mumbling prayers.  Hold my hand.  And then the guy, and Correlli, I just remember him sticking his thin head through the seats. 
[01:09:00]  And he's going, dude, what the fuck are you doing?  We're going to die.  Holy shit.  Talk to me, man.  Oh, really?  Was he freaking out?  And I was like, Correlli, shut the fuck up.  Shut the...  Because I'm trying to pray.  I'm trying to make my peace with God for all the shit I've done.  What kind of plane was it?  A big plane or, like, a little prop?  It was a three-seat and a three-seat.  Oh, that's a big plane.  Pretty big.  Yeah.  Getting banged around up there.  Holy shit.  Dude, it was so fucking bad. 
[01:09:30]  I've been on a couple things.  I've been on one where the pilot was like, all right, we're going to try to land.  I like that.  And we all looked at him.  Did he just say try?  Like, did you use the word try, motherfucker?  Turbulence is really not as bad, though.  It really is fairly safe.  And it's like, you hear that all the time.  Yeah.  But I've been in some pretty bad ones, too.  And it's like, for them, it's like, when you look at the wings, even in terrible turbulence,  I've looked at the wings in bed.  Yeah.  It's just moving like that.  Like, it's not moving.  It's not moving in an alarming place. 
[01:10:00]  You're like, oh, that's what's caught.  Like, that's all it's moving.  If Burr was here, he'd be like, oh, what are you, an avionics expert now?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what it is.  You're an avionics expert.  Yeah, what are you doing?  That's what the government does.  They get you up there.  They let the wings fall off.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You trust them.  Trust them.  You know who makes those parts?  Yeah, they ship it out to China now.  And they fucking get...  Yeah, meanwhile, Mitt Romney's like, you think he's flying United?  No, he's on a private plane, Jimmy.  They all do Congress and everything.  They fly private.  Because, you know, once they take over and half the population of the world is eliminated, 
[01:10:30]  what they ought to do is take those planes into the shaking and put the fucking bankers  on them.  And let them shake it.  Fucking Billy's crazy.  Every time Bill talks on the air, these are easily things he could be saying while I cuffed  in the back of a car.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it's...  To get over those fear, little hump of fear like that, it usually takes something where,  oh, now I have to do this.  And that, I think, separates you from the people that really fuck their lives up with fear and 
[01:11:00]  have these phobias that they don't leave the house, they don't do anything, and the  people that get over it because you realize you have to.  I think that, like, even like the, um, Howie Mandel where you can't touch people, right?  Let's see.  Right?  I think, like, it's like, if you had to get over that, if you weren't as rich as you are  or didn't have as much money and you had to have a real job and shake, you wouldn't, I  don't know if that phobia would exist for you.  Right.  I think that's kind of a rich person phobia.  There are...  People don't touch me.  Now, if it was purely psychological, what... 
[01:11:30]  That's such a fucking...  We're looking at the Fight Club scene with the plane crashing.  I didn't see the plane coming out of it, though.  They show the plane coming out, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the little flashing light out the window, and it's all nice and peaceful in  the cabin, and then wham!  Oh, come on, Edgar.  Get off me.  Mid-air collision.  Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.  We don't see it.  It's at the beginning.  They showed it.  No, I just saw it on here.  There it is.  There it is.  All right, let's go to the very beginning, Dan.  Watch Bobby roll. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I see it.  That's it right there.  I don't know why everybody has to be done.  The plane banks.  That was it right there.  No, it wasn't.  The whole video is mixed up.  It's mixed up.  It's mixed up.  It's crazy.  It's like Memento.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  That was shitty.  Why did I do that for it?  I don't know.  That's pretty stupid.  I was wondering why that guy was so calm.  All planes falling apart.  What the frig?  Yeah, that's...  That's the worst.  Did you ever visualize it in your head all the way down to the ground?  Oh, boy.  Did you ever do it?  No.  Like, the thing crashes, the fucking roof opens up, and you're going down, and you're 
[01:12:30]  just seeing fucking clouds, and you can hear that, like, humming and shirts whipping  in the...  You'd be freezing cold, and you wouldn't be able to breathe very well, and hopefully you'd  pass out.  Oh, Matt.  Imagine...  The horror.  They let these...  You ever see where they let the...  They get these cameras attached to these balloons, and they let them all the way up out  of the atmosphere, and then it pops, and then they fall down, and they have the video of  it falling, and then when it hits the ground, it's like, oh, my...  That's it.  Thud. 
[01:13:00]  If you could stay awake until...  Stay awake.  That's it.  Funk.  Oh.  And you'd just be looking at grass.  Just little grass things.  Little grass flickering.  Imagine being alive and going, wow.  How the fuck am I still alive?  Does the balloon pop when they get high like this?  And you fly?  Is that what happens?  The balloon pops, or does it just come back down?  The balloon goes...  They put these cameras on these weather balloons, and it goes 80,000 feet or something like that.  It goes up so high that the pressure of the air in the balloon just keeps expanding,  expanding, and then...  And then you see the camera coming down, and then at some point it starts spinning so fast. 
[01:13:30]  Space balloon.  Look how high up it is.  It's crazy.  Yeah, I was in a balloon like that one time.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I was.  We was up in space.  Chip, you weren't in fucking space.  He's lying.  He lies all the time.  Chip in space?  Is that a new movie or something?  Chip in space.  See, the thing is, when it lands, though, how come it doesn't break coming down?  I don't know.  It must be a balloon on it.  It must be a parachute that comes out.  I saw a parachute on that one.  Still rising at 17 miles an hour.  There's a rhythm in the track.  The phone tries to transmit a GPS coordinate, creating some interference. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, okay.  Maybe it's transmitting the picture down.  When it comes down, too, though, some things aren't aerodynamic, so it doesn't just shoot down it.  Right.  And there's nothing in it, so it kind of floats a little bit.  It won't crash and smash.  It's falling from a few miles up.  Jesus.  Why is it shaking?  Why is it going?  Is it falling now?  It's going upside down?  Yeah.  40 minutes.  60,000 feet.  The craft experience wins.  Oh, 100 mile an hour wins.  I see.  Okay.  Oh, so the camera's flopping around.  Boy, that would be hard to breathe up there. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Could you imagine being up?  I was fucking cracking up when we were up there.  You were up at 60,000 feet?  Fuck, yeah, just laughing.  Did you have a pressure suit on?  Fuck that shit.  I take pressure good.  Fucking laughing.  You were worried up there?  Like, you weren't worried about the oxygen?  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  What?  You don't give a fuck?  You're an idiot.  You're stupid.  You're an idiot, Chip.  Ah, Chip.  Shut up, Chip.  Should be a bird or something?  Soft capsule lands only 30 miles north of the launch site.  Oh.  Wow.  How about that?  30 miles.  Only 30 miles north. 
[01:15:00]  They have to drive 30 miles to find this fucking...  The camera battery is finally succumbed to the cold after 100 minutes of recording.  A mere two minutes from landing.  Oh, they missed the landing by two minutes?  Ah, that sucked.  Fuck that noise.  That's a great fear of mine, is that I accidentally get caught on a hot air balloon.  Like, my arm gets caught on the fucking string, and I'm just pulled up in the air, and there's  no one in the balloon.  That would be very scary.  How would I get down?  Oh, they put them in, like, shock containers.  You fart into the balloon. 
[01:15:30]  All right, this guy put a natural light up in the fucking...  Yeah, so you put it in the air.  It's the first natural light in space.  These idiots are probably taking planes down, too.  Like, planes are flying, just going through an engine.  Two and a half hours this flight took.  They put a balloon up with a camera and a can of natural light in front of the camera.  I just, I didn't click it for the beer.  I just, it looked like a really clean, crisp camera.  It looks very nice.  Yeah, it's cool to watch it going up, though, because I always think, like, what if I was  in a balloon and I couldn't fucking do anything?  You always think that, Jimmy? 
[01:16:00]  More times than I can care to remember.  How would you be in a balloon?  I don't know.  That's a great question.  How would you get caught?  Look at that.  That's so cool.  That's crazy.  That's up there, man.  That is pretty.  There's a beer just floating above the clouds.  Oh, my God.  And it looks like...  It's in fucking...  Oh, that, the balloon just popped.  You can see the curvature of the earth.  Oh, the balloon just popped.  The beer popped?  Oh, no, I said it was ice breaking off the balloon.  Whoa, man.  Now the balloon is spinning all...  It's spinning out of control.  It's free-falling.  No, the balloon did. 
[01:16:30]  This is what happened to Iron Man when he didn't realize it was suit.  Oh, right.  That's exactly right.  Oh, boy.  150 miles an hour, the beer is still closed up.  I bet it's icy cold then for a fucking brew.  That's what you do if the electricity goes out.  You float your beers up to fucking space.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  It hit the water.  There you go.  And the beer is still on there.  It's fine.  That fell from so high up. 
[01:17:00]  Holy shit.  60 miles to the launch.  60 miles from the launch site.  In water.  And there they go, picking it up.  Two hours to find it.  Longest beer I've ever went out.  And the beer is, they should pop that brew.  I bet they do.  Yeah.  I bet they do.  Drink some space beer.  Yeah.  The beer's been up in space, motherfucker.  That's cool.  Close enough.  That is pretty goddamn cool.  There he is drinking it, right?  What's he doing? 
[01:17:30]  They're cutting a cooler open.  I guess that's where the camera equipment was and the batteries and whatnot.  And more beer.  They had a six-pack in that fucking.  Yeah.  But, I mean, if you shake a beer, it's bad.  Imagine if it falls 150,000 feet away.  Yeah.  150,000?  Or whatever.  80,000.  60.  How about that guy?  Did that guy break the speed of sound yet?  The barrier feel like something?  Oh, the guy that's supposed to jump out of it.  He's jumping out of the hoot hair balloon.  And he's done the hoot hair balloon.  Yeah, the hoot hair balloon.  102,000 is the record. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  He's going for 120,000 and he wants to break the speed barrier.  That's crazy.  But he's jumping out of a hoot hair balloon at 100 and...  Yeah.  He did it already at 90,000.  Red Bull.  What is that?  High-powered rocket takes a GoPro camera to space?  What kind of rocket?  I don't know.  Amateur rockets?  High-powered.  I must see, but it's like black.  It's like an amateur rocket?  What am I watching here?  I got some...  Obviously, obviously not that high.  But I did get some great nighttime footage of my whole town.  And you could see the city and everything last night when I was much too intoxicated to fly the helicopter. 
[01:18:30]  But I did anyway.  Around your neighborhood?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I was lofting a lot of money in the air.  Holy shit.  By the way, did you ever have any...  Did you get a new one?  What?  Yeah, the helicopter went down?  I crashed the helicopter twice so far.  But it easily fixed.  Oh!  Let me see if I have the...  Did you get a new one?  I have a new one. 
[01:19:00]  This one is crazy.  Is this like a legitimate...  Yes.  It's a hexacopter.  It's got six rotors on it.  Oh, the devils?  Yes.  It's got six rotors on it.  And it's got a camera gimbal system.  Jesus.  And it's got a very good camera on it.  What kind?  A Panasonic...  What is it called?  A new...  No.  A new...  Newmix?  I got a text from Danny that night. 
[01:19:30]  Liker?  Lumix.  Lugo?  Lumix?  Newman?  It's a Lumix.  I fucking panicked.  Because I see...  I just like look at my text.  And the first line is...  Ant just crashed his brand...  I was like, oh, my fucking God.  And we're not even re-signed yet.  Jimmy would run to the hospital and take your fucking limp hand.  Put a pen in it and scrap your name on a piece of paper.  Yeah.  I would put a pen in it right away.  A pen in it.  It was my fault.  I took the helicopter up and I did not have the voltage monitor activated. 
[01:20:00]  So it was up in the air.  And I did not know that the battery was dying.  And it came down.  And it was a hard landing.  And all six of the rotor arms snapped when it hit.  Bam!  Isn't how upset I was that there was no one else to laugh with?  I know.  Danny was there.  And I can't laugh with you.  Your shit is broken.  It was very funny.  Was it in your yard?  It was in my yard.  That would have been better if you had to go to your neighbor's house.  Excuse me.  Can I get my helicopter out of your tree, mister?  A 60-year-old man asking for his ball back. 
[01:20:30]  That's 60.  You're terrible.  And then I had another mishap where I was trying to work out.  See, I got to go to a bigger field.  I can't do this in my backyard.  There's a fucking umbrella for the table.  There's a pool.  There's a pool house.  There's fucking a huge house.  There's awnings.  First world problems.  It's terrible.  Exactly.  There's just so much.  I don't have room in my mansion.  To fly my helicopter at my mansion.  What am I going to do, Galvin?  I can't fly my helicopter at my mansion. 
[01:21:00]  I have a fire pit.  Yes, my fire pit.  My pool house.  So it was, I had it set for automatic landing.  So I switched it, and now you can just walk away and it'll land itself.  Really?  Yeah.  But the GPS wasn't locked onto five satellites, so it started drifting toward the house.  So I had to take it over on manual control.  But when I did, the helicopter was now facing me, so I was getting the controls a little 
[01:21:30]  backwards, and when it went toward the house, it hit the gutter with one rotor, spun, careened  off of my barbecue top, and then hit the fucking, the pool floats, and broke my landing gear.  So I had to replace that.  So now I know not to go to automatic landing in my yard.  So I won't be doing that anymore.  You should bring it to a high school football field or something.  You should bring it to a junior high.  One of those field high. 
[01:22:00]  Jesus.  Why don't you just go in your backyard and rip hundreds in half?  You'll just get this whole process done quicker.  No, it's a lot of fun to fly.  I like it.  It takes great video.  Do you have to know how to fly to fly this thing?  Like, is there that involved?  Not as much as you have to know how to fly an RC plane, some RC planes, and a single rotor  and tail rotor helicopter.  Although the electronics they have now are fucking amazing.  The autopilots, auto stabilization, GPS, all this shit makes it a lot easier to fly than 
[01:22:30]  it used to be.  I used to fly the regular ones around, and it was a lot more difficult.  You have them, right?  You have like a legitimate helicopter, right?  But they're so old now, they're not even, they don't even fly anymore.  They're stupid now.  Because now you've got all this navigation equipment.  What the fuck is that?  It looks like something you need.  I know, right?  The thing you're going to fill your hole with next.  I also have a ground station, it's called, the ground station software, where it's point 
[01:23:00]  and click on the Google Maps, and it will send it wherever you want to point and click.  You don't even need the remote controller.  So it automatically takes off, goes to the altitude, you fucking type in, and then you  hit waypoints on a map, and it will fly to that waypoint, and then fly to another one,  and then automatically come back to where it took off and land again.  But that kind of takes the fun out of flying around.  That's going to be, we're going to have fucking spaceships where you just program it in. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  No, ships.  You're right.  But you are right.  And we're just going to program it in, you know, and you're going to jump in your little  fucking helicopter.  Remember they live when he puts the glasses on, that little robot thing in the sky came  down to start taking fish.  That's exactly what this is.  Doesn't it look just like that?  That's what this shit is.  I was done.  We're done.  Those things will be smaller.  Oh, wait, future Jimmy.  Future Jimmy's talking.  What's going to happen?  What's going to happen with these, Jimmy?  Well, they'll be much smaller to where you really can't see them.  I mean, now they're big, but fast forward 10 years or even maybe sooner. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  And they'll be tiny.  And we'll all be able to get them.  They'll be the size of a matchbox car, and you'll be able to get HD and 1080p video.  Oh, I love that.  The idea of privacy.  The way you think.  And then I'm going to open a brand new no-peep shades company.  So you can have your fucking no-peep shades in case you're engaging in a homosexual activity.  You don't want people to know.  Homosexual.  There's, um.  Oh, wait a minute.  No-peep shades.  Let me turn that up.  Don't-peep shades incorporated.  There it is, actually. 
[01:24:30]  You take a little look.  See?  There it is over my house.  I have it over my house.  I put it upon two ramparts.  I fucking, I left it up there just loitering over my house.  That's cool.  So my neighbors can look and say, why does he have that over his house?  Does your camera spin on the bottom like that?  It spins, and it automatically, uh, uh, go to my YouTube, uh, site to show, uh, Bobby,  how the camera gimbal stabilizes the image.  Uh, the top video.  Right there. 
[01:25:00]  You say gimbal?  It's a gimbal.  It's one of my favorite words.  Watch.  Look at the camera.  That's, that's how big it is?  Yes.  Look at the camera.  It's moving.  It automatically locks on to whatever the fuck you want.  It will not veer off from being level and straight.  That's an expensive helicopter.  Yes.  Look, I'm turning it, and it's still staying exactly.  Who's filming you?  Uh, the computer.  You could shoot, you could shoot, like, movie scenes.  Yes.  Like, yes.  Go to the, go to the one. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  Below it.  Go to that one.  Here's the, um.  Joe DeRose is going to try to use you.  Anthony, I need you to, um.  Exactly.  I got to shoot this scene.  Yeah.  With Norton.  Yeah, dude.  Gimbal lock us.  Yeah, I need you to gimbal over.  Of course, we're buying tickets.  That's the video from my yard from the camera.  Look how smooth it is.  It's like a traffic cop.  It's, yeah, it's very, very, uh, smooth.  Look at that, huh?  You got to go up to the height of a plane and just watch it from the side.  What if right now you just saw Jimmy jerking off on your chimney?  Again?  Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I have too much video of that.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's, um, it's just one of those cool fucking little dumb toys.  Did, did, did, did your neighbor hate you?  My neighbors have no idea what to make of me.  I fucking leave when it's dark.  I come home at 10 in the morning.  I'm armed to the hilt.  I have a fucking drone that patrols my perimeter.  Yes, they think I'm nuts.  That's fucking crazy good quality.  And the, it's, it's, it's amazing the quality of this fucking video. 
[01:26:30]  Very smooth.  You could go and fucking spy.  Yes.  Does that camera, can you zoom the camera from the control?  Yes.  Dude, this is, you could do anything with it.  This is stupid.  By the way, look at how shitty your neighbor's backyard is, though.  I know.  He's got a fucking shit lawn.  Fuck him.  Some gravel and a stupid Kigs.  See, that's why I'm saying, Bobby, as time goes on when these are so, so much smaller.  Yes, future Jimmy, yes.  They'll be a lot smaller.  Yeah, Jimmy's Dense Shade Company will be such a popular one.  Aren't they smaller now from, like, the original helicopter? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Haven't they, aren't they small now?  They've gotten amazing with what they could do.  And also, also the, look at that house.  Go to that house next time.  The camera has a separate remote controller.  So I put the, the copter up.  I click a switch over to GPS lock, and it locks it in position in the sky.  It won't move.  And then I could pick up the other controller and work the camera.  So you don't even have to fly the thing.  And now it's like a slow, up we go, behind the trees, and now we see the expressway, the 
[01:27:30]  parkway.  Is that water?  No, that's a road.  No, there's a road.  No, there's a trees.  Oh.  I thought that was a river.  Why would the car be driving over the river?  There's no car, stupid.  No, I was kidding for the listeners.  Very suburb.  I live in suburbia.  I live in suburbia.  Get off me, Edgar.  It's very nice, though.  It's, it's, it's, uh, the technology is what I am.  Amazing.  I'm a technology junkie.  I love new shit and electronics.  Bobby's going to have his personal fishing boat up on eBay later this afternoon. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  And then I go, oh, oh.  See, now I'm moving the camera gimbal around.  That's your, that's your pool.  You get a straight down view.  Wow.  Yeah.  What's that bloodstain by the pool?  Oh, well, don't pay no attention to that.  Hey, what's that fucking man in a hat lying, sprawled down on the lawn?  Wow.  That's cool, man.  It is really cool.  Like, that's what it would look like to be, what's that, 500 feet in the air?  Not that high, no.  That's just a couple hundred feet up.  I would hate to fall into your pool from that height.  She gets something written on the bottom of the pool. 
[01:28:30]  I know, right?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Suck this.  Yeah.  Whites only.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jim wasn't such a bad old crow at that.  Old crow at that.  Now, you're going down now and zooming at the same time.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not how powerful the zoom is, right?  No.  Now I'm fucking around with the gimbal to spin it and turn it.  And no matter where you move it, it's always also compensating for the movement of the helicopter.  So you don't have to, so it's so smooth like that. 
[01:29:00]  You get a lot of great foreground and background.  So if you have this, what do the other people, like the fucking rich people have?  Well.  You know what I mean?  Most of them don't really care about these things.  I'm, like I said, a junkie with this stuff.  Yeah, but like what, what does the fucking government have?  What's the, oh, the government's got fucking drones.  You know what I mean?  If they have drones, they have predator drones, hellfire missiles.  If there's an alcoholic in Long Island with this, I want to know what the fuck the government has.  Flying around at 10 at night. 
[01:29:30]  There's no way you should have this type of fucking technology.  They found bin Laden with what the government has.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  They were watching bin Laden every day from fucking, what, 25,000 feet?  You've got to think of what, where, like Future Jimmy was saying, where this is going.  I have it now because, thank God, I've been blessed with the means to get it.  But as time goes on and the prices come down and the technology gets better, they're going to have to regulate what civilians can get.  Because at this point, right here, what I have, I've been talking about what's to stop somebody from remotely dropping a gun in a prison yard with one of those helicopters. 
[01:30:00]  Or dropping a bomb.  Or a bomb or fucking, like, like anything.  You can fly that into drugs.  How about fucking drugs right in a fucking prison yard?  You just drop it down into the fucking thing.  And from a remote location, flown by waypoints, so you could be a mile away from the thing.  You're not even near the prison and you could drop it in there.  Or, uh, I was thinking, I was at the Yankee game the other day, I'm like, how cool would it be to just to fly it into Yankee Stadium during a game and just fly around as people are chasing and trying to figure out what it is. 
[01:30:30]  And then just videoing.  And then you send the video to fucking, talk about viral video.  You're giving everyone ideas.  Yeah.  Just hang a cock from it and just slip it down.  Yeah, a big fucking dildo hanging from it.  A blow-up doll.  But, but these are things.  How funny would a big blow-up doll, oh, oh, just flying around Yankee Stadium.  Yankee Stadium.  With like a Red Sox jersey on. 
[01:31:00]  People would go bananas.  Oh.  It'd be hilarious.  But, but these are the things they're going to have to somehow try to regulate and make crimes out of it.  I mean, you could get, you'd probably get something like endangering because, you know, oh, it could fall out of the sky and crash into people.  But that to me is something people are going to, once enough people start getting the availability of these things, people are going to start doing stupid shit with it.  Yeah.  I'm not.  I mean, if, if, if this dumb thing ends up at Yankee Stadium, they're knocking on my door.  I just told a bunch of people what I would love to do with it. 
[01:31:30]  I tell you, I'm not doing stupid stuff.  I'm just, at night.  At night.  Last night I was flying it over my neighbor's house.  I was behind the bush last night flying it in front of the security guy's car for the neighborhood.  Like, there's some black security guy that just drives around with the yellow light flashing.  And I hid behind a bush and just flew it down in front of his car.  Baby, there's a UFO.  He was like, ah, shit.  It was funny.  I wonder if they're going to.  I am creepy, yes.  They're going to see all this fucking schoolyard footage.  Anthony's jungle gym cam. 
[01:32:00]  He gets one of those, one of those little arms that can pinch a skirt up and pull it up.  Field hockey time.  One of those Titanic submarine hands.  But dude, how cool would this be like they're doing now to watch animals with?  There's so many.  They use them for that Discovery Channel stuff.  They use a lot of those.  Yes.  They have a camera and like a ball, and it will follow like the polar bears, and they  can whack it and fuck it.  Yeah, lions.  I've seen a lion cam that they've used.  Yeah, they have all these crazy new cameras out. 
[01:32:30]  Wow, that's amazing.  The technology is amazing.  Oh, wait for when?  20 years.  20 years.  20 years.  You're going to be like a little bug.  Future Jimmy.  Think about the transportation we're going to have in 20 years.  I don't buy the transportation angle.  I just saw this.  It's a BPG motorcycle.  This thing's fucking stupid.  A BBC motorcycle?  What?  A TNB motorcycle?  A BPG motor.  Yeah, just put motor. 
[01:33:00]  And then do video.  Motors.  Yeah.  This fucking thing.  What the fucking thing?  Whoa, what is that?  This is available, man.  What is it?  It's a fucking...  It's like a pumpkin.  It's like a two-wheeled motorcycle that turns into a regular...  A two-wheeled motorcycle.  That's crazy.  What the fuck?  That's the future.  Two-wheeled motorcycle.  Yeah, what's next?  It's a four-wheeled car or an 18-wheeled truck.  It turns into a one-wheel, like a Segway.  What?  It's like a Segway.  You can drive it in an elevator, turn it around in the elevator, and then when you hit the  street, it turns into a regular motorcycle. 
[01:33:30]  We used to make them like that when I was a kid.  Never did you ever.  You didn't fucking never...  You don't have a motorcycle license.  That's pretty cool.  Wow.  But watch it...  It's like an ad-ad.  Watch it change.  It's fuck...  The guy comes in.  It's on one wheel.  It's actually three wheels, I guess, when you look at it, but it's crazy.  This is available...  Who's that?  Oh, man.  That looks silly.  It's one wheel.  The guy's on one wheel.  Is this thing even real?  Yeah, it's real.  I don't think it is.  Click on the...  You can go to the actual website.  There it is right there.  There you go.  Watch this shit. 
[01:34:00]  That's pretty cool.  One wheeled thing.  All right.  That's silly.  What's it?  Folded in half?  Oh, the two wheels are next to each other like balls.  The wheel watch.  Look at this guy.  All right.  That looks silly.  It's crazy, though.  It's like you're riding a little hot like a fucking Bronco horse.  What's those things?  A Bronco horse.  What are those things that throw you off the...  A mechanical horse.  Mechanical horse, yeah.  Mechanical bull.  That is silly.  Yeah, this is all the...  All right, come on.  Why would you need this?  Well, they show the one that's done at the end of this, I believe.  Watch this.  Ready?  Looks like you're doing a wheelie.  Look it.  And then it turns into a regular motorcycle when you're on the highway. 
[01:34:30]  Watch.  What the fuck, dude?  That's pretty amazing.  The wheel comes out.  What the fuck, dude?  It's like a transformer.  That's amazing.  It's exactly what it...  Dude, that is amazing.  It's a transformer.  And then you can do up to...  It says here eight miles an hour.  Yeah, which is good in the city.  Put all this stuff up on our Facebook page.  Could we please, so the listeners can enjoy, please?  You wouldn't fucking want one of those?  I have one.  No.  No, you don't.  I'm afraid of motorcycles.  I know.  Me too.  I know that too, stupid.  Go ahead.  Just touch it.  It's getting a little plumpy.  Is it? 
[01:35:00]  He's touching Jimmy's dick through his pants.  He's not touching it.  Danny just smashed his hand down onto his dick.  Danny, you don't have to do that.  He's not touching it, and I won't move.  You touched it.  Did you just touch his rod?  It's like a...  Is it tumescent?  It's like one of the sausages, you know, like the one that's bent.  A big blood sausage?  You know the sausage that got bent and then frozen?  Oh, the bent one.  Yeah, it has a little thumbprint in it.  God damn.  Why do you have a half-heart on?  He always does.  I get them sometimes, yeah. 
[01:35:30]  Why?  He always does.  I don't get it.  We're in a room full of guys.  It's not the atmosphere.  That motorcycle was really exciting.  Yeah, yeah.  That must have been it.  It's really cool.  Yeah.  This shit's cool, too.  That, yeah.  They're using that shit now, too, which is fucking nuts.  Fucking, you strap it to your body, and you can pick shit up.  Like, you know, an extra 200 pounds.  You're like super guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  That's fucking nuts.  It's always Asians that are demonstrating these things.  Yeah, you know that shit works once.  These are very good robot legs. 
[01:36:00]  We put robot legs, lift very heavy things.  What are they lifting?  We just walk.  Look at us walk.  If we had these, we beat your ass in war.  This new samurai, very strong legs.  What are they lifting?  It's heavy.  No, but they can't walk.  They're paralyzed, both of them.  No.  I swear to God.  They're both paralyzed.  Stop. 
[01:36:30]  I swear to God.  They're both paralyzed.  These are for paralyzed people.  That is the next step.  All right.  That's pretty cool.  Is it the next step, Jimmy?  Yeah, they're paralyzed, so to speak.  I love future Jimmy.  So you put those on.  Come on.  No way.  You put them on, and you can walk.  Sip.  All right.  If that's the case, that's pretty cool.  It's like the Dark Knight.  Yes.  That's what they gave Bruce Wayne.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking badass.  That will be the next step, though.  You're right.  Even though you won't know you're walking, just be lumping around.  It kind of looks like Stormtrooper legs, but skinny. 
[01:37:00]  And they're strapped to the side of these people's legs with like a back brace belty thing.  And they're...  But how does it work?  How do they know?  Well, the thing is, it's a little teeny camera on there, and you can actually hear it.  It just goes, step, step, step, step, step.  And they're trying to take that voice out because it gets annoying.  Step, step, step, step, step.  I was a paralyzed with a fortune cookie accident.  No, it's Japan, not China. 
[01:37:30]  Exactly.  Terrible.  And you don't have any fortune cookie accidents.  No.  China just remakes good shit that Japan does.  Yeah.  Makes it shittier.  Makes it cheaper.  Yeah, it has a cat waving on you.  What a fucking stupid money cat.  That's pretty cool.  I love technology.  Is that fucking nuts?  Hey, call me old school.  You just give me a buddy and a cup of Joe, and I'm happy.  I fucking hate guys like that that don't acknowledge.  Yeah, you know what?  You get your computers and what?  Your sig-sags? 
[01:38:00]  You give me a buddy and a cup of Joe, I'm fine.  Really?  Asshole?  A cup of Joe, morning constitutional, and I'm good.  You give me a container of coffee and a good buddy, and we'll hang out.  Good buddy.  Hey, you do all the fancy stuff.  What do I need?  What am I going to walk around on my phone?  Hey, I make the phone calls at home.  I walk around when I'm outside.  Yeah, you kids, keep your faxes to yourself.  I'm good.  I'm a face-to-face meeting kind of guy.  Yeah.  I'm a Joe shake-a-hand kind of guy.  Yeah, you go ahead. 
[01:38:30]  You and your robots, and you fall all over the place on your computers.  I meet a guy.  I sit down.  We have a container of coffee.  He doesn't understand the technology.  A container.  You're on the, what do you call that, your worldwide superhighway?  Yeah, what?  Yeah, what do I know?  Twitter.  What am I?  I don't tweet nothing.  What am I, a bird?  I just sit down, have a roll, and a cup of coffee.  A roll?  Nice butted roll, and a cup of Joe.  Yeah.  Sam's fucking breakfast of choice.  Yeah.  I like butted rolls.  He likes a butter roll, and a man's ass hair, and a cup. 
[01:39:00]  That thing is fucked up.  I guess you could carry heavier loads with that.  Heavier loads.  Yeah.  On a backpack kind of item.  It straps to your feet and your legs, and it turns into a little backpack, like Bobby's  boat.  You just tow it in.  That's pretty cool.  That's pretty badass.  Yeah, I like that.  Yeah, we're fucked.  I have robot friends.  I can't wait.  If they have the jetpacks now, not a jetpack.  They call it a jetpack, but it's not.  Would you get one?  It's $120,000. 
[01:39:30]  I think it's $120,000.  Would you buy one if you had the money?  No, that's dangerous stuff.  He does have the money.  I know.  I said it.  He does have the money.  I don't know.  What is a jetpack, though?  It's right here.  This one.  It's called the Martin jetpack.  I'd get this.  If I had your money.  Martin aircraft.  If I had Norton's money, I'd get this.  Indoor flight control.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  All right.  That's so badass.  I want this.  It's like a jetpack from the future.  It's too high, though.  But it uses ducted fan technology. 
[01:40:00]  8,000 feet in the air that can go.  Yeah, but who needs that quack all the time?  Not a duct fan.  You're trying to enjoy it peacefully after.  Oh, my God.  You're hilarious.  Holy shit.  It's a guy flying out of a warehouse at one foot off the air with two giant air conductors  around him.  Big fucking deal.  And it uses vector control fans to go forward and backwards.  Wow.  And then it's got a big fucking engine on it.  And these two big duck fans. 
[01:40:30]  What makes it zoomy up, though?  Zoomy up?  The two big cylindrical things behind him are like ducted fans.  And his feet are just hanging all stupidly.  That's for altitude.  And then the forward and backward motion are those little ones that are moving on the bottom.  And that makes him go forward and backwards.  Why don't you give yourself a seat?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  They do.  They have the water one, too.  That's fucking ridiculous.  I don't like the water one where it's the tube in the water and it pumps water.  That's kind of cool.  On a vacation, you wouldn't do that? 
[01:41:00]  Frightening.  No.  Why?  Where's the guy going 8,000 feet?  I want to see video of this.  You can go right here.  Which is this?  No, up here.  This is the Martin right here.  That's 8,000 feet.  I don't think he goes.  It can go 8,000 feet.  I don't think he goes 8,000 feet, Jimmy.  Damn it.  They say the cops are going to have these in the future.  Soon.  Citizen.  Could you imagine that?  I'm getting pulled over by one of these things?  Holy shit.  Look at this thing.  He just goes over and grabs your helicopter out of the air.  That's the fucking Terminator.  That's crazy shit.  That's a hunter killer. 
[01:41:30]  Dude, he's fucking flying.  Is that fucking nuts?  He's way up in the air.  Is that nuts?  I would keep one in my apartment and only go one foot off the ground.  Yes.  I'm going to zoom over there to my computer.  But if they...  Ah, the papers are flying everywhere.  Your carpet's peeling off.  Look how high he is.  That's fucked!  And if you could put that GPS to shit you have in yours...  I'm sure he has it.  ...where you could just put...  Well, you don't even have to fly it.  You just jump in it, hit where you're going, and it takes you where you want to go.  Dude, this is insanity. 
[01:42:00]  Imagine 50 years from now, and these fucking things are just...  They're like...  They can just...  It's like a little chair.  Yes.  You just sit in the chair and fly to work.  And you put your warm fans on.  They keep you warm at that height.  That is going to be what the flying car is.  But a little more...  A little more creature comforts.  An enclosed cabin, perhaps.  You have to have it enclosed.  Because nobody wants to put on a jumpsuit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, no one wants to put on a jumpsuit.  Yeah, I've got to do a spot at the cellar.  I've got to wear a jumpsuit.  A silver jumpsuit.  Unless you're DeRosa with a dumb helmet. 
[01:42:30]  With a stupid fucking helmet.  Dude, I got my helmet, man.  Why is he wearing a helmet?  He has a bicycle.  Well, that's cool.  That's a radio control hunter killer.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  That's pretty fucking badass.  I just found...  Who knew?  Who has that?  The animals?  I might...  See, he's a hunter killer.  I thought maybe the deer chipped in and got one.  What's that?  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking cool, too.  God, I love this shit.  I need more science in my life.  Do you know what I want to get?  I want to get a fucking... 
[01:43:00]  Science.  A thing that goes up in the air.  And I want to take my pants off and just fucking lower myself at a height level in front  of a girl's face and just go back and forth and fuck her mouth and then zip away.  You would use all that technology and money and everything just to mouth fuck a girl.  Just to pin a girl.  A foot up in the air.  To pin a girl up against the wall of Stop and Shop and fuck her mouth in the parking lot and  then zip home.  You'd have to move the craft forward and backwards.  That's what you would do?  I should have to tell the police, a man from space came down and came in my hair. 
[01:43:30]  I was raped from a man from space.  This guy's got a flying fuck.  It's the word fuck made out of some type of lightweight, maybe, styrofoam.  And he put it on the side of a little remote control helicopter and it just flies around.  That's excellent for live press conferences.  That's pretty funny.  This guy's laughing his ass off.  He's his own biggest fan right there.  Jimmy Norton, the flying rapist.  The flying spaceman rapist.  The flying spaceman rapist.  Yes, indeed. 
[01:44:00]  What did he look like?  An alien.  His feet was just dangling, all silly looking.  And the next thing I know his trousers are down and he's got me pinned up against the stop  and chop wall.  You know, between where they're in Bradley's meet and he was fucking my face for a good  hour.  She could just walk away.  He couldn't keep his erection because he asked me to play with his nipples while he was using  the machine.  He's raping Long Island Yenta.  Why is he talking?  It's the greatest chess player ever. 
[01:44:30]  It sure is.  Holy shit.  What's he talking about?  And I will power lift the rook and fly it over.  They have a helicopter in the room.  To a C-5.  It's a flying dick.  I love that they made it a Russian helicopter, though.  One of those shitty ones from Rambo 3.  Someone took a dick.  Someone just swatted at him.  Oh, someone had a flying dildo to Gary Kasparov.  Someone at a press conference took a dick, a rubber dick, and put it around like the  fuselage of the helicopter and flew it into the press conference. 
[01:45:00]  Can we see that again?  That is great.  We could watch this all day if you'd like.  I wish someone had a flying dick on a helicopter.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Now it's flying over the crowd.  I didn't even see that.  It's a laughing dick and balls.  They're all laughing.  How about the guy who has to swat it?  I know.  Dude, you broke my dick.  He had to swat it a flying dick. 
[01:45:30]  His friends are calling him gay because he touched it.  He touched it.  He jumped up in court with his ass cheeks.  That was great.  It just flies in and flies in.  That's hilarious.  What a fucking clown.  I got to pee.  All right.  I guess we'll take a break.  We wanted to do a little Jocktober.  I keep teasing it like a radio guy.  Remember they got mad yesterday because we didn't do Jocktober, so they attacked Rich  Voss' Facebook page?  Yeah.  Don't do it to Bobby, and I don't mean it.  Listen. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You probably should have said that an hour ago.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I love it because I'll block every fucking cock.  I love it that they reveal themselves.  I'll block every cocksucker that did it.  You're jerking off.  I'm so happy.  Sorry.  I thought you were asking.  I haven't seen it, but I got tweets that it was happening.  I'll block every fucking cocksucker.  Good.  Keep doing it so I know who you fucking cunts are.  Oh, boy.  By the way, Kurt Schilling.  Yeah?  What a dummy. 
[01:46:30]  What did he do?  What did he do?  Just quickly, because I've been obsessed about this story all morning.  Oh, what happened?  Schilling may have to sell bloody sock after company collapses.  Ooh.  He may have to sell that famed sock that he wore in 04 in the series, the World Series  Championship.  You don't have the pair.  We're going to have to frame it.  What are you looking to get for it?  It's going to cost a lot to get that stain out.  That stain out.  We're going to have to wash it. 
[01:47:00]  I'll give you $100 for it.  They found out it was fake vampire blood.  Oh, yeah.  38 Studios was his company.  They filed for bankruptcy.  And they listed the sock as collateral to the Bank of Rhode Island.  So that was one of the things.  She also has a hat from Lou Gehrig.  And I think they said Schilling personally guaranteed almost $10 million in loans from Bank  Rhode Island and like $2.4 million from another bank.  What was the company for?  It was a video game company.  And they had 300 employees. 
[01:47:30]  He was a big EverQuest guy.  Schilling.  I remember hearing that when I was playing EverQuest, it was, oh, Jesus.  It was, he was really into it.  38 Studios, it's called, which was Lord to Rhode Island.  They said from Massachusetts.  With a $75 million state loan guarantee.  Holy shit.  They had a spectacular collapse.  They said the financial problems kind of sprang in a public view when they missed a $1.1 million  payment.  And within weeks, they laid off 300 employees in Providence and another 100 at an affiliate 
[01:48:00]  in Maryland and they owe 150, almost $151 million and they have assets of about $22 million.  Whoa, man.  So according to court filings, they, uh, 38 Studios in Baltimore made separate bankruptcy  and they owe more than $121 million with assets of more than $335,000.  You know what I'd be doing?  I'd be, I'd go to fucking, uh, CVS.  I'd buy a bunch of packages of socks. 
[01:48:30]  I'd put them on and then I'd get a knife and stab myself in the ankle and then just  sell all those.  Yeah.  Socks for you, socks for you, socks for you.  Socks for everybody.  A million dollars a piece.  Gotta get out of debt.  But they said the bank is on loan for like a hundred million dollars.  They're on the hook because the bank guaranteed it.  He's broke.  He's fucking broke.  Well, Schilling conceded that he was absolutely part of the reason the company failed, but  he kept accusing the governor, I guess, uh, who was sharply critical of the loan guarantee  of having an agenda that fucked the studio.  So fucked 38 studios. 
[01:49:00]  Schilling has also put his 20 room home on 26 acres in Medford and Medfield, Mass on  the market for $3.45 million.  That's it?  The house had it up there.  Yeah.  Massachusetts, Western Mass.  It had a heated pool with a waterfall, like some other people we know.  Wait a minute.  A beach volleyball court, batting and pitching cages and a putting green was listed on sale  in 2008.  Schilling has said he invested as much as $50 million in 38 studios and has lost all of 
[01:49:30]  his baseball earnings.  Oh my God.  Why didn't he just get back into the game?  He did, uh...  What?  He did the Sam Roberts show to promote that game.  I guess he didn't do the numbers.  Oh no, he did.  How much money do you pump into a game?  What happened?  Was it a lame game?  Or I don't...  What was he pushing?  What game was it?  It was a game like EverQuest.  Oh no.  It was his own right.  You don't fucking...  You got World of Warcraft.  It was like one of those massive online multiplayer things.  You got World of Warcraft. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  You got fucking EverQuest.  Why would you try to get another one?  But I'll tell you this.  What was it?  All baseball players in a fantasy world?  Yeah, you throw the ball really fast and you follow the ball quickly through a hallway.  Your weapons were all like baseball bats and fucking...  You throw those donuts at people.  You have to cultivate a farm team.  The studio game company that he was working for.  It was 38 Studios.  Founded in 2006.  It is now defunct in 2012.  They have one game release and that was this game. 
[01:50:30]  That was the game.  What was the game?  It was called Kingdoms of Amalur.  Amalur?  Amalur.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was launching the company and promoting the game.  Oh, excuse me.  I'm sorry.  I got it wrong.  Excuse me.  Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.  Right.  Oh boy.  Can we see a bit?  Is there any video screencaps?  I want a screencap.  I want a screencap of some of the graphic.  Any in...  I like Kingdoms of EverQuest.  Get off me fucking Edgar.  Edgar's playing a gamer.  Just cut your fingernails.  Edgar subscribed and then he's just sitting there alone in a fucking universe because 
[01:51:00]  no one else is playing the game.  I play in television.  Actually, everybody's playing this and he's on PlayStation Home or whatever the fuck that  thing is.  I can't find anyone for a ring.  I don't understand why they can't just fucking stop.  You made $50 million.  Just relax.  Do an Anthony.  Get a pool.  Get a helicopter.  Hang out.  And bang some chicks.  Hang out.  Just stop.  This Sunday...  Why do you have to keep trying to be a businessman?  This Sunday I'm replaying that interview.  Oh, you're after now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  You got some screencaps?  You want some gameplay?  I want some gameplay. 
[01:51:30]  Or some cutscenes?  Let's get some gameplay.  All right.  I want to see in-game graphics of Kingdoms of Amular.  Amular.  Reckoning.  You're forgetting Reckoning.  Reckoning.  That could be the whole...  Maybe there's another game called Kingdoms of Amular and how would you differentiate it?  Nope, this is his only game.  Was it on Xbox?  Can you guys please get Edgar off me?  All right.  Exaggerating.  Oh, boy.  It's not fair.  All right.  I'm looking at people with pointy ears.  I'm looking at scantily clad chicks with pointed ears. 
[01:52:00]  What are you, a wood elf?  Are you a blood elf?  It's not even that good at graphics, is it?  He said they worked on it for years.  That's how these games are.  It looks very similar to any other...  But the running doesn't look that good.  No.  It looks like they're running on ice in fucking glass shoes.  Slip, slip, slip, slip, slip, slip.  Who would play this?  I guess you thought it was going to become a phenomenon.  Well, it looks like every other one of these games.  It's like, you know, it's like you like beer, so you're just like, now I'm going to brew my beer and it's going to be the best beer. 
[01:52:30]  Which would have been a better thing to do.  Yes.  A shilling beer would have made a beer.  Millions.  Drunks up in Boston would have fucking bought it up like crazy.  A little blood in it.  Are these as good as Rockstar's graphics?  No.  It's a different kind of game, too.  It's like, you've got to kind of cut some corners for the fact that you've got so many people playing and so many...  Yeah, these games aren't so much about the graphics.  No.  It's like the in-game.  It's more about the story and the storytelling.  Right, right.  And leveling up.  Yeah, the movement is... 
[01:53:00]  Getting your new weaponry.  But it's the same.  I mean, World of Warcraft, if you're going to play it, you play World of Warcraft.  You don't play super chilling games.  And they love, this was just a video game you put out?  There's always 150 million for a video game?  Yes.  Yeah, he put out...  Because he launched the company and put all the money into the game.  You know what it is to develop?  To develop.  Yeah, but you know how much money?  It's crazy.  If you get a hit video game, you're going to make a billion dollars.  Yeah.  Especially something that's subscription-based where you could not...  Not only did you sell the guy the game, but now you can charge him eight bucks a month  to keep playing the game. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I get a new map from fucking Call of Duty every month that I paid for.  But guess how much money you're going to make if nobody buys it?  You're going to lose hundreds of millions.  You lose your bloody socks.  How long did it take...  You lose your bloody socks.  How long did it take this company?  You see them on TV, please buy this game.  If you have to ground up, design a massive multiplayer game like that, it's going to take years  and millions upon millions of dollars.  Why wouldn't he have come on other radio shows to promote it?  Well, he didn't come on our show.  He came on the fucking Sam Roberts show. 
[01:54:00]  That, to me, is like, why go anywhere else?  That's right.  Right?  The guy draws fucking over five million hits whenever he puts a video up.  That's exactly right, Anthony.  Every video.  Five million.  Every single video.  Five million fucking hits on his goddamn stupid Apple thing.  I love that girl.  Did you make any money?  Well, that's none of your business, is it?  That means yes.  Woo!  You made money.  How much bank do you get for something like that?  Not much.  Did you just click the ads on?  How much?  Dribs and drabs?  Dribs and drabs?  Dribs and drabs.  Million dollars?  About a million dollars. 
[01:54:30]  You get a buck a hit, right?  One dollar per view.  One dollar per view.  So five million dollars.  That's why I'm still here, because I made five million dollars on the video.  Honestly, it can't be that much, but it's definitely more than a couple of hundred bucks.  It's no Charlie bit my finger.  It makes it worthwhile.  The video is amazing.  Charlie!  Charlie's a bad boy.  He always bites when you put your finger in his mouth.  He did.  That's nice.  He just spit.  Just came out of your mouth. 
[01:55:00]  Uncle Paul just drooled.  That Charlie's always biting everything.  Stop spitting fucking evidence out of your mouth, Uncle Paul.  Shut up!  You're going to get yourself caught.  Charlie bit my finger.  I got to take a...  All right, yeah, yeah, we went through that shilling thing, and we'll come back and perhaps  get us into, uh, uh, the old, um, Jacques, Jacques, somebody wrote on Twitter that, uh, we should  get, uh, radio shows from France and call it Jacques-tober.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, on that, take us out. 
[01:55:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on SiriusXM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  Fuck you!  To my ex-wife, while I was going back to school, you were fucking a big fat guy with a tiny dick.  Well, when I left, I told you I'd find one younger and hotter.  I'm now fucking a dream redhead.  And she, the way she fucks makes you seem like fucking a sweaty pillow. 
[01:56:00]  So guess what?  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I want to give a big F you to Jim Norton.  I picked up a hooker for the first time in my life, and she kept playing with my nipples,  and I couldn't fucking cum.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Fuck you!  I got two fuck yous.  One for the fucking cunt that gave me chlamydia, and the second one for the fucking douchebags  on the phone phone.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, this F you goes out with fucking Opie.  Opie, really? 
[01:56:30]  Whenever anything is so fucking funny, do you always howl?  Are you always howling?  Are you howling at the moon?  You're howling, you fucking boob.  You fuck.  Fuck you!  Hey, it's a fuck you that goes out to Larry.  Hello, primetime Sammy.  Sweet, we get it, Larry.  You like to kiss ass, don't you say?  You're an ass kiss, and that's your end for the show.  No, that's your end for Sam's asshole.  Fuck you, Larry.  Fuck you. 
[01:57:00]  Fuck you!  I'd like to send a big fuck you to everybody driving over the Tappan Sea Bridge during sunset.  Hey, assholes, the sunsets are the same fucking place.  But come on, do you really fucking have to throw it on and mess up traffic?  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Hey, Cialis, you wonderful little fucking boner pill.  I need to say fuck you to you, though.  Two days later, I'm walking around the gym, the towel brushes my cock, and I get a giant  raging erection in the fucking locker room. 
[01:57:30]  No, it's not because of the men.  It's because of the towel.  A towel loves my cock, and I get a fucking hard-on.  What the fuck?  Fuck you!  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What a fun time we're having, even during the breaks. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  We've been just yapping.  Me and Bobby just yapping about the biz we call show.  I was, yeah, I was telling you about the, I'm at the, where the fuck am I?  Where are you?  You're at the broker.  Bohemia.  Bohemia at McGuire's Governors.  McGuire's.  Tonight.  And then tomorrow I'm at the Belmore, New York, Brokerage Comedy Club.  Bob Kelly Long Island Tour.  I kind of like that they do that, though.  It's not.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, I don't want.  You've got to go to Jersey after, you know.  I like, no, I like that they sit, they're one club one night, and then you're at the 
[01:58:30]  other club the next night.  Yeah.  Kind of switch your shit up.  Same people?  Same people.  Love them.  They're great.  Yeah.  Fucking treat you great.  Pay you good.  Shows are great.  I like Long Island shows.  They're fucking savages.  Yeah, they really are.  They get fun.  Yeah, but they get the jokes, though.  Especially that Bohemia crowd, man.  Oh, because you're talking Suffolk fucking County.  Brokerage, you're doing tonight?  I'm doing Bohemia Maguire's tonight, Brokerage tomorrow.  And Maguire's is cool.  I mean, I had a good time last time.  There was a drunk guy.  Look, I almost lost control. 
[01:59:00]  Losing the control of a crowd hasn't happened in years.  Yeah.  Because even if it's a nightmare, like, I had a problem in Vinny's Club last weekend.  I attacked this table of women.  It was their birthday party.  And I looked down, and at one point, they were all on their phones.  Oh, boy.  And I just fucking attacked them.  Fucking bitches at comedy shows.  What's with that?  They can't.  They're addicted to their phones, man.  I'm addicted to my phone.  Why'd they go out?  Yeah, but there's certain situations, you know, like, what are you doing? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  You're there to fucking.  Why did you come to the comedy show?  Yeah.  Well, it was her birthday.  Of course.  Happy.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  It's my birthday Monday.  Happy birthday.  How old are these broads?  What'd you say?  They had to be 35 and up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They all looked the same, so it was kind of a family thing.  Oh, boy.  They looked like gypses.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And they're looking at me.  This is the funny part.  When it says no phones.  Yeah.  You can't use your phone.  Don't text.  Don't. 
[02:00:00]  And then you go, hey, what the fuck are you doing?  And I didn't say, you fucking cunts.  I was like, what are you doing?  Really?  You can't just not look at your phone for an hour?  And then they looked at me like they're pissed at me.  I go, look at her face.  Now she's mad at me because I'm the bad guy.  I go, you.  You're fucking wrong.  I'm the bad guy.  Yeah.  And then, you know, Vinny gave her free tickets, and there you go.  Well, that's good, though.  You want the club owner to side with the people talking.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  That was with Vinny.  Jesus.  This club, though, last time I was there, this drunk guy, and he was so fucking drunk 
[02:00:30]  with a bunch of Long Island dudes, I had to just back out.  Really?  Yeah.  There was no way I was going to go.  I was going to win this one.  He was so drunk, he didn't give a fuck about me.  So he didn't care.  Okay.  Yeah.  What was he doing?  You got to read that.  He was just fucking going.  And they were laughing at him, too.  He was actually being kind of funny.  Oh, no.  Was he mad at you?  No, he was just shit-faced.  And I said something.  I go, what the fuck is wrong with you?  I fucking don't.  I drink.  Yeah.  And they were just dying. 
[02:01:00]  And it was kind of funny because he was so fucking hammered.  You couldn't, I couldn't say anything to him.  I'd have to go get him the fuck out.  Right.  And then get my ass kicked.  Oh, boy.  Did the club quiet him down?  Yeah, they quieted him down.  Oh, okay.  They walked.  Yeah, they don't fuck around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Meguiar's and the guys that own Governors.  They'll get the old lean into the guy.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, James.  You wonder what he's saying when it's like, because the whole crowd sees the guy comes  up, leans over and. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, here's the thing.  When a guy in Long Island is wearing cufflinks at a comedy, you might want to show your face.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy's got fucking diamond cufflinks.  Cufflinks.  He's wearing a fucking, you know, thousands, $2,000 suit.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's at a, you know, 110 seat comedy club.  Pulls down on his lapels a little before he leans over and talks to you.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, you might want to.  Hey.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, yeah.  When you hear this in your ear, hey, shut your face, okay?  Hey.  Have a good time, but shut your face.  You having a good time? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So do the other people.  They want to have a good time, too.  See what you're doing here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just really try to perform my best when I'm there.  Yes.  You have Kenny, though.  You have the Kenny monster, Jimmy.  So when, not all the time, but when Kenny's there, he's the guy that goes up, isn't he?  Or the club will, or one of those.  But, you know, Kenny sometimes, he can't be in all places at all times.  No?  No.  Even though he seems like he would be.  Like fucking Zyklon B. 
[02:02:30]  But, no, he's always there when he can.  I mean, he'll shut them up.  But sometimes, after the show, I'll be like, what about that guy?  What the fuck was it?  And he goes, I didn't even notice him.  I didn't notice.  Yeah.  So sometimes I have to point it out.  But he's good.  Yeah.  He is good.  You're going to love that.  Why don't we delve, delve into a little jocktober?  Huh?  Wow.  Come on.  Let's burn some more bridges for the comics on this show that can never, ever go to this  show.  I'm glad I got my plug out. 
[02:03:00]  Exactly.  Well, I think we hit on a lot of shows that you probably don't go on.  No.  You'll let us know.  Yeah, I will.  And then you could say, oh.  You'll know.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Just walk out.  Em.  This is my voice.  Yeah.  What?  Norton, could you just say something so they know the difference?  Oh, right.  Well, no.  Norton doesn't really delve in either of something.  But, no, he does.  He calls all the holes fat pigs, too.  Come on.  Just have fun with it.  Okay, bye.  I always say stuff like, hey, look, what's with this chick? 
[02:03:30]  She doesn't belong on the radio.  She belongs to something else.  Who's that?  Who's this?  Who's that?  Well, I don't know.  Somebody's entered the studio.  A new person.  Who is that?  Who is that?  It's Unflappable Jimmy.  Unflappable Jimmy.  You really are an idiot.  You are correct.  You have a lot of characters.  I love your characters.  They're all dumb.  Unflappable Jimmy.  He also calls them friends. 
[02:04:00]  Yes, yes.  Sammy, play the, what do we got?  Yeah, let's, should we play the intro to the segment?  I think we should.  All right, yeah.  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys. 
[02:04:30]  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  Jocktober.  You bet it is.  Yes, Jocktober.  Yeah, a collection of, you know, around the country radio shows that perhaps aren't in the style of the Opie and Anthony show or the Sam Roberts show.  Or the Sam Roberts after show or the Sam Roberts podcast or the Sam Roberts everything else that he fucking does 24 hours a day. 
[02:05:00]  Five million hits on YouTube.  And a dollar a hit.  He's doing very, very well.  We have five million dollars.  That's right.  Five million.  What's that?  I'm sorry.  This kid was bragging about his video before.  He was telling me, he's like, yeah, let me go out.  I'm going to buy myself a 36-inch television.  I was just like, geez, keep it to yourself, buddy.  Flat screen.  I'm braggard.  With a flat screen.  Is there any other this day and age?  Flat screen?  I don't know.  Anything else?  No, I guess not.  No?  No?  That's about it?  Who are we featuring today, this Friday, on Jocktober? 
[02:05:30]  Well, today we go all the way to horseman country.  That's Charlotte.  Charlotte, North Carolina?  North Carolina.  So we're talking about the South.  Yeah, that's right.  Now, this is a syndicated morning show.  Syndicate?  That's right.  They're in a lot of different markets.  So they have to appeal to many different areas.  And the quality has to be up, up, up.  You can't just be a local yokel, one market program.  So they must be good.  That's right.  Yeah.  Very good show. 
[02:06:00]  In Charlotte, North Carolina, they're on 107.9 The Link.  The Link.  And their names are Bob and Sherry.  That's the Bob and Sherry show.  I'm going to Charlotte, actually.  107.9 The Link.  I just booked Charlotte for all this year.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I hope you weren't supposed to go on.  I told Kenny to keep a list of all Jocktober stages.  Yes.  So I do want to listen.  Well, I mean, this is like a very family-oriented station.  I would assume.  Now, do these guys, does this guy and girl pretend that they're married? 
[02:06:30]  I mean, they're not married, but they do have a certain chemistry about them.  A little relationship-y kind of a thing.  Absolutely.  And there's no wild sports guy?  It's not like a three-person show like we've been featuring with the whole and the wild sports guy.  This is strictly two-person.  They have a news guy, a traffic reporter, all that.  Is he a seasoned veteran, Bob?  Oh, yeah.  Seasoned veteran.  And Sherry keeps Bob...  Does Sherry keep Bob in control?  Well, Bob...  The only...  Bob is a seasoned veteran. 
[02:07:00]  Uh-huh.  But he does like to have a little fun.  Oh, boy.  You know what I mean?  Thank God, Sherry's there to just keep things from getting a little too out of control.  Right, because sometimes, you know, Bob is, you know, he wants to take it to the next  level, and Sherry's like, hey, let's remember, we're on the air, Bob.  We're on the air.  Keep that for the man cave.  Yeah.  That's what you got to tell Bob every so often, I'm sure.  Hey, Bob, keep it in your pants.  Fucking shows are the worst goddamn things.  I think so.  Oh, and there's a live stream of their show.  Holy shit. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, man, that's them right there?  Yeah, that's them.  Is that them now?  Yes.  And including ourselves, there's a whole ten viewers in there watching this shit go  down.  Well, something tells me that number might go up.  Oh, 11.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  They're just sitting there broadcasting their normal day.  Oh, no, they don't know what's going to happen.  No, they don't.  It's like watching a disaster in the making.  It is.  We're watching them.  What was the website?  What station is this?  What station?  It's 107.9 The Link in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
[02:08:00]  I'm going there.  It's a Bob and Sherry show.  12 viewers now.  12?  Let's see what the show's like.  It might be good.  All right.  What's the first break we're going to hear from Bob and Sherry?  Well, I thought the show I recorded was a Thursday show that they did.  A Thursday.  So I thought we would start with their Thursday song.  Oh.  They do a Thursday song every Thursday?  Yeah.  I mean, that's how they start the show.  Oh, God.  Because you wake up in the morning and you don't know what day it is.  20 viewers.  20 already?  It just rolled like a fucking slot machine. 
[02:08:30]  They probably think they're having a heck of a show.  Oh, it's still going.  Jerry Shepardini just came up.  Oh, no.  I hate Jerry Shepardini.  The little music notes.  Oh, no.  Hey.  Are they saying nice things in there?  Oh, God.  So far.  We haven't even played one clip.  Yeah, nothing's happened.  What's up?  Jack Tober just entered the room.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  They have no idea where this is going.  They probably think, like, hey, man, stay on this topic.  Oh, Jesus.  Guys. 
[02:09:00]  What did she just write?  This is to the listeners.  You may like the show.  Yeah, what if it's so before?  I mean, why judge this show?  You haven't heard it.  That's you.  Should we play the Thursday song?  Yes.  Play the Thursday song.  Okay, here it is.  All right.  I'll see you Thursday.  Thursday night.  Yeah, it's Thursday.  Thursday.  The day before Friday.  The day after Wednesday.  Two days after Tuesday.  Thursday.  Because it's Thursday.  Thursday.  Thursday.  Yeah, Thursday.  Thursday.  I don't care about you. 
[02:09:30]  Thursday doesn't even start.  So sometimes it's me.  Mimi Beardsley.  Thursday.  I've got to come up with a small portion.  It's the gateway to the weekend.  Thursday.  Now here's Bob and Sean.  You can't curse.  They have the.  This is terrible.  Thursday.  The gateway to the weekend.  So they do that on Thursday.  Have a stroke.  Jesus.  Someone said nice iPads.  iPads.  Stick it up your ass.  Oh, no.  I just love the names in here.  One guy's Ricksh.  Vosh. 
[02:10:00]  Uncle.  Ted.  There's 62.  60.  Wow.  The kid double guns.  The viewers keep going up.  You think they're like, wow, the room is really getting busy.  Yeah.  No, because they know something's up.  Because usually it's eight.  Yeah.  And now it's 67.  Something's amiss.  Yeah.  This is not right.  It's just.  Yeah.  Eat those chips.  Where's Bob going?  Please die.  Piss.  Carrie always is in the room.  Piss cunt just checked in.  That's not even funny.  They want me to die.  That's terrible.  I hope I do die.  Not you, dummy.  It's probably the Bob on the show. 
[02:10:30]  Not Bob.  What's the show called Bob and Sherry?  I'm sorry.  Self-centered Bob.  What do you think?  You're the only Bob that everyone hates?  Your friend over here going, have Bob die hot.  Jesus.  All right.  We got the Thursday song out of the way.  Yeah.  I want to hear a little bit of Bob and Sherry tossing it back and forth to each other.  Well, they did a topic.  All right.  And it was, how long does it take for you to tell somebody to be quiet?  In a different situation. 
[02:11:00]  It's like, how long does it take for you to get mad at somebody?  What's the polite thing to do?  Somebody wrote, I will pay you to punch that gun to the chops.  Jesus.  By the way, did you know, did you guys know that the bull in Canada, that station that  we did on Monday, that there's a blog on their website about being bullied?  But that's another Canadian that we had a problem with who goes right to bullying.  It's amazing.  Bullying is not a bully situation.  We're being bullied.  People, stop with that fucking word.  You're a grown woman.  I got accused of bullying just because I disagreed. 
[02:11:30]  Like, someone had one opinion, I disagreed, and then I was a bully.  You're a bully.  I don't know how that happened.  It's amazing.  You are a bully.  It's amazing.  Not in that instance.  I just disagree.  I'm a wooly bully, and by that I mean a fun song.  You want to hear?  That song.  I want to hear how they tell people to be quiet in certain situations.  Bob and Sherry.  Bob and Sherry on 107.9 The Link in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Audio clips, podcasting, and more at BobandSherry.com.  All right.  Sherry's with us.  Hello, baby.  How you doing this morning?  Oh, man. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's been a morning.  Big day yesterday.  Big day today.  All right.  So, you know, once in a while, people do things when they're out in public, and it's so annoying,  and you try to suck it up sometimes, and you ignore it.  But once in a while, if you're in a mood, and you know how you get, Sherry.  I mean, once in a while, you're just in a mood, right?  Once in a while, I'm not in a mood.  I think it might be more accurate.  What?  What? 
[02:12:30]  You know, I guess I'm in no mood today.  She's in a mood most of the time.  Right, that's what she's saying.  You know, once in a while, she's in a good mood.  That's given Bob quite a chuggle.  It really is.  But they do just laugh at them talking.  That is true, though.  I'm married, and, you know, it's more, you know, you might as well say, you're in a good mood.  What?  That's how they do it.  They laugh during the setup.  Anything to keep the good-natured energy going, so the listeners stay tuned in.  Oh, no, the first half of this sentence doesn't have a laugh. 
[02:13:00]  How many people are in the room now, Dan?  It was eight when we started, right?  Eight people is the average.  Well, right now, currently, I mean, obviously, there's been some churn here,  but there's 177, and that number just keeps, it's just, look, it's just like getting gas in your car.  Oh, my God.  It's 186 at the moment.  It's spinning like a slot machine.  Wow.  They're saying a lot of dirty things.  Yes, they are.  A lot of cunts going down in the room.  Oh, that's awful.  Oh, they figured something out.  You know how it censors cursing?  Yeah.  Not with a space in between the letters. 
[02:13:30]  There's a space between each letter.  Then it does not censor the words anymore.  The word goes through.  So you can put whatever you want in there.  Oh, now we're, oh, Jesus.  We're scraping 200 now.  Wow, that really is going up very quickly.  We didn't even let them start their break.  How come there's no one in this room?  Let's get some people in there.  Fuck shit up.  I mean, no, you shouldn't do that.  They're wishing AIDS on people.  Oh, that's nice.  A nice racial rant.  I can't believe they're, are these their fans?  I guess so.  I would imagine.  Can we get a full screen or no?  Nah, I don't think so.  Their fans are terrible. 
[02:14:00]  Fat Bob Kelly.  No.  That's wrong with him.  No, huh?  All right, let's, I want to finish their break here.  All right, we still got a lot left on.  With Bob and Sherry.  You only have 217.  Like every 28 days, things are kind of cool for, I don't know, maybe 72 hours, and then  the movie turns.  Period?  So somebody does, yeah, menstruation.  That's always good.  I like a female co-host that'll talk about her fucking rag.  Right.  That's pretty good.  Something annoying.  How long should you wait?  All right, so we have suggestions on how long you should wait from people who look at these 
[02:14:30]  sort of things.  What was the question?  Somebody is talking.  He's setting it up again, but it's like, how long will you wait before you ask somebody  to be quiet?  Okay.  Talking in a movie theater, right?  They're going on and on, maybe not real loud, but they're talking in a movie theater  before you go, hi.  So how many minutes?  Or seconds, or whatever.  How long before you should wait?  It depends on their race, Bob. 
[02:15:00]  I mean, that may be, what about you, Ant?  Like, how long until you go, shh?  Wow.  Instantly.  I'll say instantly, because I just don't put up with any guff.  Oh, Anthony.  Whatever.  How long before you should wait?  I'll give you five minutes to talk about.  Really?  Whatever it is.  And then I'll, I'll go, hey, shh.  It says here two minutes before you make in the shh sense. 
[02:15:30]  Two minutes?  Now, two minutes is a fairly long amount of time, if you're just thinking about it.  Bob, I'm a social worker.  You know, I give people that extra little bit of faith in their own ability to self-correct.  Uh-huh.  What do you guys think so far?  Uh, I like the chemistry.  Yeah, the chemistry's good.  I like the chemistry.  And at least she's a woman with opinions, you know?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, anybody who would sit in a movie theater for five minutes, as somebody loudly spoke 
[02:16:00]  next to them without saying a word, it's gonna make an entertaining radio jock.  Uh-huh.  She's got a lot of patience.  Yeah.  All right.  What else have we got from, uh, Bob and Sherry?  Well, they're not done talking about this.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not.  This is terrible.  They're gonna continue to, uh, talk about it.  And they, this, oh, this is good.  What they do here is they throw in a little bit of theater of the mind.  I like theater of the mind.  They have a scenario that we can play along with. 
[02:16:30]  Uh-huh.  And we can watch as they play.  You think he envisions scenarios?  Fucking you.  That doesn't interest me, doctor.  Doctor.  How long before you ask somebody on a cell phone to keep it down?  Keep it down.  What is the average weight?  Somebody's talking on a cell phone.  And please allow me for just a moment.  Where's my cell phone?  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's he doing?  This is what it sounds like.  You're over at the table.  Okay.  And this guy is next to me. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Right.  They're play acting.  Well, we're gonna try as hard as we can to get that, uh, shipment out.  We've been, uh, a little behind, a little bit backed up.  It's nothing to do with whether or not we can come through with it.  We can come through with it without any problem.  Have you lost interest?  I'm fucking so lost in this.  This is so uninteresting.  How long do you wait to interrupt?  Yes.  I say an hour and 44 minutes.  That seems like a long time.  You might be right. 
[02:17:30]  Do you think people in their cars just kind of, because, you know, you kind of zone out  and then zone back in.  He's like, wait, he's talking about shipping stuff now?  People in their cars are, they're, they're fucking, uh, uh, crashing.  Yeah.  They're, they're dozing off.  You know that feeling you get when you're really tired and you're driving and you just  can't stay awake and you're scared for your life?  Uh-huh.  That's what people are doing listening to this drivel.  Driving into telephone poles?  I mean, it's not even one of those, because we've done Jocktobers where the subject is  stupid, the hole is cackling, but there's something about the subject matter that would 
[02:18:00]  get people thinking.  It's like, this is nothing.  No.  I don't know what they're talking about anymore.  The answer to everything.  How long would you wait before you ask somebody to be quiet?  All of it is no time.  Immediately.  Immediately.  You just say, please be quiet.  But yeah.  All right.  Let's, let's try to get through this.  We're going to try as hard as we can to get that, uh, shipment out.  We've been, uh, a little behind, a little bit backed up.  It's nothing to do with whether or not we can come through with it.  We can come through with it without any problem.  It's that loud sometimes. 
[02:18:30]  I have a great idea.  Instead of being confrontational, which could mean that you're going to get cut, instead  of being a doormat, which doesn't feel good, especially for a recovering codependent person.  Right.  What's wrong?  I can't.  No, no, no.  I can't.  You haven't letting them, you can't interrupt somebody in the middle of a setup.  Wait, Iraq.  A setup?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Setup's going forever.  Oh, nice.  Iraq, what did you say?  You had what?  Uh, right before we figured out.  Oh.  Thanks.  Uh, right before we found out they had this video chat room. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Apparently, they were inviting girls to come into their chat room for Wootober.  And these are girls who get drunk at parties that used to go Woo all the time.  You can call in and do your Woo's.  In the studio?  Or on the phone?  They want them in the chat room to call into the show and do their Woo's.  Oh.  What the fuck is that?  I have no idea.  I pulled a clip if you want to hear it.  They're angering me.  They're angering me.  Wait. 
[02:19:30]  Let's see.  Wait, let's see.  We've got clips.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here, here's more of them talking about the cell phones.  Right.  Okay, you be that guy and I'll be you.  All right.  I'm the guy with the phone?  We're going to role play.  You be that guy.  All right.  Let's do your business call.  So anyway, um, the only thing I'm asking for is that the payment, that we receive the payment.  Honey.  As far as we can.  Honey, oh my God.  Wait a minute.  I can't hear.  No.  The doctor, they're going to need the payment.  They want to lance it.  We're going to need the payment.  He said it's full, like maybe as much as two cups. 
[02:20:00]  I don't know, puss.  I'm not going to be able to sit down for a week.  All right.  I got it.  He's the hole.  Wow.  Yes.  Oh.  There's the reveal.  All right.  I got it.  You see, because she is talking about something even less pleasant on her cell phone.  Right.  So the other guy is going to hang up his cell phone.  Horrid. 
[02:20:30]  You don't like the show?  No.  It's terrible.  I've heard a lot worse, though.  Like, it's not making me angry.  It's just like kind of blah.  Yeah.  It's very blah.  It's just, it makes me angry that they're syndicated.  Are they?  Yeah, and a lot of markets.  Probably huge markets, right?  A lot of markets.  Yeah.  Are they in a lot of markets?  Oh, yeah.  Would it make you feel better or worse if they continued on with this topic?  You've got to be kidding me.  No, no, no.  They have not exhausted this yet?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:21:00]  There's still a lot of gold to be mined here.  Gold.  That's right.  All right.  All right.  Number three.  How long do you wait to give a parent a dirty look for not dealing with a loud baby?  Two seconds.  You don't like loud babies?  No.  All they're doing is yelling.  Hey, that's their baby.  Mwah, mwah.  Mwah, mwah.  They're telling lies.  That's their baby talk for what? 
[02:21:30]  Ouch.  Somebody lies.  Trying to draw attention to when two people are talking private.  Somebody in their video chat room is just asking for turd.  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  Is there a few people in there now?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I saw Stone Cold E.T. in there.  Stone Cold E.T.  It's approaching 500 people.  Oh, nice.  It used to be eight.  They have no idea why.  Eight people, not 800.  Eight people.  I just saw the entire chat taken up with swastikas.  Oh, no.  That's what Anthony sees at like the Matrix everywhere he goes. 
[02:22:00]  I could read those.  To me, people are doing turds, swastikas, and then repeating Apple 5 over and over again.  Yeah, Apple 5 from your video.  All right, let's hear more about giving parents dirty looks.  How long?  How long?  How long would you wait?  You wait.  What's the average time that the average person will wait before they give the parent the dirty look?  I have never given a parent a dirty look. 
[02:22:30]  I seldom do.  I seldom do.  I seldom.  It's good that they brought it up then.  How long will you wait?  Both of them said, I won't.  Oh, good.  I'm glad we brought up this topic of conversation.  Now, he has not had children, so I seldom.  Get it?  No, seldom means infrequently.  Thank you, Chip.  You see that?  Oh, oh.  Ah, here we go.  A very special guest on the phone. 
[02:23:00]  Mr. Colin Quinn.  I hope Chuck Tobler isn't ironic.  Why?  What's the problem?  It's scorch-like by its very nature.  It really is scorch-like.  I miss scorch.  It better be ironically said.  I'm warning you guys.  But here's what I want to say.  I'm calling for one reason and one reason only.  Yes.  Because a 15-year-old girl left a message on Twitter last night going,  today, arguably the worst day of my life, with no explanation. 
[02:23:30]  So all of her fans are soon to be going, what's wrong?  No, that wasn't why I did it.  A 15-year-old girl.  It's Jimmy.  No, that really isn't why I did it.  I was going to elaborate.  I was going to elaborate, and then I was...  Okay, why don't you elaborate in your diary next time? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, fuck.  No, I just had a very disappointing experience,  and I was just like, ugh, it was just too much to get into.  Really?  In 140 characters?  I didn't do it at all.  What's that?  Yeah, Colin.  The thing is, all night has been hugging me for two reasons.  One is because I'm actually genuinely interested,  like all the rest of your fans are going, what happened, Jim?  And he ignores it.  Like, guys, I can't go into it.  Then don't bring it up, stupid.  Second of all, just leave it out there like the worst night of my life. 
[02:24:30]  I swear to God, I'm going to forward that tweet  to all the countries of the Sudan.  Good, please do.  You know what?  When I explain what it is, they'd probably understand in the Sudan,  how disappointing it was.  I knew what it was.  You know?  Yes.  Well, what was it?  How do you know?  I don't know what it was.  He accidentally left the room for a minute when he came back to masseuse,  had been in his drawer, and taken a couple of extra hundreds.  Very disappointing. 
[02:25:00]  No, I just, I didn't say I was depressed or I wanted to hang my,  I didn't say, like, I don't want to live anymore.  I just said the most disappointing night of my life.  That wasn't like, oh my God, rescue me.  I was just like, fuck, I was just bummed about something.  But I didn't feel like, it was like, just too much.  You can't put out a thing like that that's kind of like, oh, I have something great,  and then not tell us what it is.  Oh, I didn't, to be honest, I didn't think that much into it.  And not call one of your friends and talk to us about it.  No, I, I, no.  You told a hundred thousand, a thousand strangers how you feel.  Why don't you call me? 
[02:25:30]  Because I was talking to my, I was talking to a friend about it.  Yeah, why didn't you call Bob?  Yeah, you know what, dude?  You got your health, you got your head, dude.  You got your iPhone.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  But no, it wasn't, I didn't, I guess it was like that, but it wasn't intended to be some hate.  No, not at all.  Everything okay now?  Yeah, I was just bummed about something.  Was it something very, very personal or business?  It was, uh, not business, no.  Oh, it was personal?  No, no, but something I wanted to do, which I, you know, whatever. 
[02:26:00]  It was just, something was supposed to happen that didn't work out.  Was it a photo op?  Yes.  I knew it.  Oh!  A photo op?  It was a photo op.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no, Colin.  I will kill you!  That's what it was.  It was.  Oh, God.  Who was supposed to be around?  I don't think it was serious.  Because remember, earlier in the week, he said that he may have some photo opportunities coming up.  And they were in New York City.  And he was all excited.  Very excited.  Oh, so this is disappointing. 
[02:26:30]  I saw that tweet, and I knew when he said it was the most disappointing night of his life.  I was like, it's just a photo op gone wrong.  Yeah, but I didn't mean, I wasn't trying to be cryptic.  I was just, I wanted to, I didn't want to write anything nasty, or like, I just like, ugh.  I was just fucking, it was just disappointing.  I'll put it this way.  After you took the photo, would you have to adjust the balance of the contrast?  Yeah.  All right, so we know.  Who's the photo op supposed to be?  Who's the photo op?  I don't even want to talk.  A photo op.  I don't even know what to say right now. 
[02:27:00]  How about, I don't want to live anymore?  Oh, shit.  What a, I mean, honestly, I give Jim so much more credit.  What a superficial ass.  But we all know how Jimmy is and how he likes these things.  It's part of his, his life.  You want to have the perspective to at least, even if you're being a superficial person,  just to say, hey, I'm tweeting this out to a couple hundred thousand people, you know. 
[02:27:30]  I'm sure they all have a lot of more consequential problems than this.  But this ass actually tweets out the worst day of my life.  And I almost thought, wow, something really heavy happened.  No, but I didn't, I didn't, I said most disappointing.  I wasn't saying it cryptically like, hey, guys, I'm in pain.  No, you were saying like a 15-year-old girl.  No, but I was very, I was very disappointed.  And it, look, we all have different things we like.  I like taking photos.  You like removing all fluid from your fingers and hands. 
[02:28:00]  I happen to like, see, because he has dry hands.  I like to, oh, God.  He should have said, remove from crowds from comedy class.  I didn't even get it.  What's that?  That one bombed because I didn't even get it.  Well, I just, yes, I was just, I was just very frustrated.  We all like different things.  I like to open my mouth, but I'm mad.  Call me a pervert, that's fine.  I just didn't, I was very disappointed the way something worked out.  Aw.  Or didn't work out.  I feel bad now.  Yes.  You and me both.  Aw.  So it was, I know something.  It was a situation that didn't have to happen the way it did. 
[02:28:30]  Well, Twitter is not a toy.  I guess that's my message.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  Yeah, but that wasn't, it wasn't a, like, you know, I was just like, ugh.  But it would have taken too long to get into.  Yeah.  Like, I just couldn't have explained it fully.  Was it, was it, was someone being an asshole?  No.  Or was it just a missed opportunity?  It was something that was told to me one way that didn't go through, but had. 
[02:29:00]  One thing goes one way, one thing goes the other way.  And I'm in the middle with a camera going, how come no one's looking at me?  But I was, I could have, I could have probably made it happen through other means.  But did you trust somebody and that didn't, then didn't go through?  Yeah, because I didn't know that it wasn't 100%.  And I wish I would have been told that, like, hey man, this might not, and I would have gone through the other means.  But you're taking pictures with everybody in the world.  Who can it be that made this big impact on you?  Well, you know, it's just, it all is not lost yet. 
[02:29:30]  So I didn't want to, that's why I don't want to say.  I'll talk about it next week.  I'm not trying to tease it, I'll just.  It's the most, it's the most undramatic tease of the whole time.  All is not lost.  All is lost.  All is not lost.  You take pictures of people and nobody gives a fuck.  Yeah, you're right.  I am going to kill myself.  You're right.  No, Colin, don't tease.  But I did have pictures of most people.  What are your plans, Colin? 
[02:30:00]  Are you going to be anywhere where we can see you?  Yeah, this weekend I'm probably going to drive out to Bohemia, New York and to McGuire.  I see Bobby Kelly.  Is Bobby out there?  I didn't even know that.  Can I just say really quick, Colin at all times stalks me and knows where I am.  You can call him at any time of the day.  Where's Bobby in three weeks?  He'll know where I'm at.  He has this creepy thing with me.  I normally can't memorize Bob's whole schedule.  He memorizes my schedule every week and every day so he knows where I'm at. 
[02:30:30]  My third moment is when he forgets and we just throw out where he is or where he's going  to be and he just gets filming.  Yeah.  They'd be like, so you're in the kitchen.  You're in my...  It's all right.  What are you doing?  You got a funny one?  You got a little go.  Yeah, Bohemia tonight and...  Brokerage tomorrow.  Brokerage.  Am I working with your brother again?  My cousin.  Your cousin.  Cousin, yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Probably the brokerage anyway. 
[02:31:00]  He's the king out there.  He is.  Hey, he's the king out there, father.  He's the best.  But you're not going to be anywhere, Colin?  No one can see you anywhere?  What?  Come on.  You say the N-word?  No, I said no one can see you anywhere.  What is he, reading your mind?  I know, right?  He's a mind reader.  That would be any mind reader, any time of the day, ever, reading my mind.  Anybody can read Anthony's mind.  Money, young pussy, nigger.  Yeah.  It's either, he's a, it's like a, it's a dollar sign, diapers, or a lynching. 
[02:31:30]  It's one of three things.  Jesus Christ.  I know, exactly.  Should we replay Bobo's $20,000 question, things Anthony would say?  Oh my God, was that fucking funny?  Because he got that one right, too.  Yes, he did.  God, that was funny.  We should do that.  All right, Colin Quinn, we leave you.  See you tonight, man.  Thank you for pointing out just how shallow Jim Norton is. 
[02:32:00]  Maybe it wasn't the most earth-shattering thing, but it's such a fucking dick move.  Colin is so precise with his, he just sees through it.  He knew.  But he was incorrect in his assessment of it.  No.  He thought it was something much more important.  Yes, I thought it was something more serious.  Yeah, dude.  He didn't get a photo.  No, but I wouldn't have, but see, if it was something that was legitimate, like, oh no,  a girl wouldn't go out with me, or, that to me is fucking teenage girl-ish, because 
[02:32:30]  that's real melodrama.  It's just something I was disappointed in.  No.  I didn't get a picture with Justin Bieber.  A little trivial situation, and he goes, this is the worst day of my life.  I didn't say it was the worst day, but I can tell you, this is the most disappointing  thing.  I'm trying to think of things I've been wanting to happen that I thought were going  to happen that didn't.  I cannot think of anything that has ever been more disappointing than this.  What about your Jeter picture? 
[02:33:00]  This is, nothing can better.  Really?  Nothing.  It wasn't just a missed photo, it was something else?  Yeah.  Jim, don't tell me what teenage girl.  Anthony!  Yeah.  Fucking, yeah, because he, like, he puts his pecker in him, Carl.  Jesus.  Fucking Chip.  Chip.  All right, Colin Quinn.  You're a saint.  Somebody has to make the uncomfortable mood.  Okay, well.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  See you tonight.  All right.  Take it easy, Colin.  We're going back to bullying.  Yeah, we've been bullying.  That's all we've been doing this October.  Your fans attack friends of the, they attacked me this morning, and then you're attacking  somebody else.  They need something.  They're like piranha.  Yeah.  Any meat in the water is fine by them.  How many people in this room now?  Well, I've told they shut down the live room.  Did they?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's commercials and stuff.  They've actually shut down the live stream. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So.  Oh, boy.  Success, I guess.  I guess.  I just saw a big thing of Arabic.  Arabic.  I saw that, too.  Arabic?  Just fucking Arabic.  Yeah.  He changed his keyboard to Arabic.  Jesus.  That's you.  They're probably communicating through your fucking fans.  EastsideDaveCountry.com.  Yeah, it's people here on PalTalk I'm seeing are actually doing that. 
[02:34:30]  It's very interactive.  It's amazing.  Okay.  What other clips do we have from Bob and Sherry?  Well, they're still playing How Long Would You?  No, they're not.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah, they are.  I seldom do.  Now, he has not had children, so I really admire you as being a better person.  But if you've had children, I think that you do, if you're a good person, put yourself in their place and say, well, I've been there.  Now, there is, by the way, the average person will wait 40 seconds.  40 seconds. 
[02:35:00]  The last time this happened to me, the average person needs to chillax because...  No, she didn't.  She's right, though, man.  You got to just fucking chillax.  Chillax.  A lot of people are high and strong, right?  This chick is fucking cool.  Oh, chillax.  That's how young people talk, right, Chip?  I don't know.  Yeah, we just fucking hang back.  You do this with your fingers where you put your thumb and your pinky out and you shake it.  Like the Hawaiian...  Aloha.  Aloha.  And you just chillax.  Whatever it is.  Hang ten.  Fuck, yeah.  She's right. 
[02:35:30]  I did that a couple times.  Chillax.  Chippa.  She's just trying to get the young kids on board.  I guess.  That's what you're doing.  I use chillax all the time.  You do?  When I'm around my younger friends.  Me, too.  Yes, yes, of course.  Just chillax.  Chillax.  It hurts more if you're tensing up.  But they don't understand what chillax means.  Their arms and legs just kick out confused.  My gaga, daughter.  My what? 
[02:36:00]  Did you just do...  Yeah.  That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard.  You did baby talk?  Yeah.  He does the baby hands, too.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hands and arms are kicking out.  Oh, we're going to look at Hulk Hogan's giant, famous dick again?  Bobby didn't see it.  He wanted to see it.  Of course he wants to see it.  His fucking massive dick.  All right.  So she's chillaxing or telling people to chillax.  Right.  That's where we left last with Sherry.  And they're saying, how long would you wait to, I don't know, do something? 
[02:36:30]  To do something.  Right.  Whatever.  Sometimes, I mean, a baby cannot be reasoned with.  An infant, you cannot reason with an infant.  Sure you can.  You can't bargain with it.  You can't be bargained to or reasoned with.  It's a Terminator baby.  You think so, Uncle Paul?  Sure you do.  You take the rattle out of the baby's hand and you give me something more fun to grab.  And they tug it like a rattle.  A rattle.  Look, it's a rattle candy dispenser.  Oh, great. 
[02:37:00]  But let me ask you this.  I was in a situation where there was a little boy.  He was four years old.  Yeah.  And he was just flipping out and doing all kinds of stuff.  And his parents were not dealing with him.  Right.  And without even thinking, because I'm so used to my own kids and my friend's kids.  Right.  I picked up a frying pan and cracked his skull open.  And then I tried to drown him in the bathtub like I do with my own kids.  Kids and my friend's kids.  Right.  I looked up from, I was in a waiting room.  I looked up from my game on my phone and said, little dude, dude. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  Little dude.  Little dude.  Dude.  You know, dude.  You know what, dude?  You got your GI Joes.  You got your Matchbox.  You got your doody pants.  Boom, dude.  And said, little dude.  Dude.  Come here.  You want to see a picture of a monkey?  And he looked at me and I flipped.  I hit my picture and I flipped my phone around and showed him what was on my phone.  And you know what he did?  He stopped.  He shut up.  And do you know why that is?  Oh, boy.  Because an iPhone is a child hypnotic device. 
[02:38:00]  It is.  And plus a screen.  You know why he shut up?  Because it was a picture of my cunt with a banana next to it.  And he said, look, monkey mouth banana lady.  Jesus Christ.  It wasn't even a banana.  It was her big yellow dildo.  Why banana have two heads?  Jesus.  Vibrating banana.  Make humming noise.  Vibrating banana.  How come?  Why banana have bells on one end and head on other? 
[02:38:30]  Big yellow banana next to monkey face.  Why bananas smell like my fish tank?  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  Yeah.  An iPhone is a child hypnotic device.  It is.  And plus a stranger is something interesting for him to deal with and knew.  He stopped.  Now, I don't know if his I don't know or care if his parents appreciated that, but everybody  else in that waiting room did. 
[02:39:00]  Sometimes I let him look at the thing on my phone.  There are some parents that would not appreciate that.  And I would be nervous about doing that.  But I think that's wonderful.  You did it.  Wow.  You know what I like?  What?  I like about this show that it's like it's not something he would do, but he can appreciate  what a wonderful person his co-host still is.  You know what?  And it's an even Steven kind of show.  Right.  This isn't Bob with Sherry as a sidekick or just an aside.  No way.  She's contributing just as much nothing as Bob is. 
[02:39:30]  I've heard a lot worse than this.  It's not great, but I've heard a lot worse.  I've heard worse, but I haven't heard such nothingness.  Nothingness.  What is his milk toast?  Oh, oh no.  Wow.  You asked for it.  What was it?  What was it?  Belly button?  Belly button?  It's not as bad as it usually is.  Jimmy put his finger in his belly button and waved it under Bobby's nose.  I don't like his finger was shaking when he did it because it smelled so bad.  Is there a load in there?  Yeah.  Yeah?  He just goes, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  You leave loads in your belly button?  Who doesn't?  Me.  Jesus Christ.  It really is horrible.  Such a drop off from this show to this show.  I know, right?  Yeah.  They're trying to fucking just have good old fun with people and he's sticking his finger  in his jizz belly button.  Jizz belly button.  Do you have a deep belly button?  Does it come out like a piece of rigatoni?  Yeah.  I've actually sluggled diamonds into the country.  You can put baby jimmies in there. 
[02:40:30]  It looks like fucking ziti.  That jizz when it comes out of your belly button.  It's like a Play-Doh fun factory.  Yuck.  No, it's not.  No?  Okay, I'm sorry.  Nice.  Chipper, chipper.  Hey, chipper.  Chipper.  What else do we...  We might as well finish.  Yeah, we gotta keep going.  They're still actually talking about things.  How long would you wait?  No, they're not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They still got some ground to cover with it.  Why would they continue with this subject? 
[02:41:00]  No, they're gonna do a little more.  Because, I mean, they can see that it's going well.  Fucking A.  And all the jokes are there.  Yeah.  You've heard them.  Yeah.  You know.  So here's a little more of Bob and Sherry in Charlotte, North Carolina, talking about  how long would you wait to do things.  That's not right.  Bob and Sherry.  All right.  So we're talking about how long should you wait when somebody is annoyingly late for  you, doing something.  Talking in a movie theater.  Things like that. 
[02:41:30]  Just things that are inappropriate.  We're back to our last two here now.  Thank God.  How long should you wait before you give up on the person who's standing you up on a blind  date?  It's a blind date.  You're at the restaurant.  How long do you wait before you bail out?  Half hour.  What year is this?  Half hour.  You fucking don't go on blind dates anymore.  Here's the fucking thing.  You hook up on fucking Twitter or Facebook or whatever the fuck it is.  And then you trade horribly pornographic pictures. 
[02:42:00]  And then you do some sexting.  Okay.  And by the time you actually meet, you've already had some type of fucking relationship.  And you send a car to her house because she's not legal to drive.  And you get...  It's not quite true.  Send your helicopter to pick her up by her fucking backpack.  Fucking Bobby.  Fuck.  You're going to have your helicopter just dropping lollipops.  Lollipops.  Lollipops.  I love Bobby. 
[02:42:30]  Lollipops.  Lollipops.  Lollipops.  There's a fucking adorable way to say lollipops.  Just shut up and stop correcting everything.  I'm not.  You said instead of lolly, you said lull.  I say lollipops.  Lollipops.  That's the only way the English say it.  I was listening to Nick DiPaolo and he was saying hot dog like hot dog.  Yeah, and I was eating a hot dog.  Hot dog.  Hot dog.  Hot dog.  Hot dog.  And lollipops.  Lollipops.  And schedule.  All right.  That's English. 
[02:43:00]  That's...  That's...  Your schedule.  Sherlock Holmes.  Schedule.  Okay.  What the fuck are we up to with Bob and...  What they're doing is seeing...  Now, how long would you wait if you were on a blind date and the person wasn't there yet?  Uh-huh.  Yep.  Date.  It's a blind date.  You're at the restaurant.  How long do you wait before you bail out?  Half hour.  Half hour.  Bob?  20 minutes.  Okay.  You said 20 minutes.  20 minutes.  Until you have something better to do.  Oh, we're not playing? 
[02:43:30]  No, we're not.  Until you have something better to do.  All right.  I'm sorry.  The question is, how long do you wait in a restaurant?  Right.  Until the appetizers are gone.  So, maybe 25?  Five seconds.  For me.  Odd.  26 minutes.  Because what if you've got a flat tire?  What if this person is your soulmate trying to get across town to connect with you and they've  been caught because of an accident?  What's the likelihood of that?  What if they're being kidnapped and raped by four people?  Yeah.  She's really coming up with a scenario here. 
[02:44:00]  What if they're having a tumor removed?  What if it is your soulmate, though?  What if this person is coming and that's going to be the person you're going to spend the  rest of your life with and have kids and they're going to have kids and generations and  generations of kumias aren't made and don't get a chance because you didn't wait until  she got out of, you know, out of the principal's office.  You know what I mean? 
[02:44:30]  No school bus had been sent.  Because you couldn't wait until fucking 2.35.  2.35.  Yeah.  I get all worked up when I hear that final bell.  You love when you're behind a bus, a school bus, and that stop sign whips out and you  have to wait.  I will be honest with you.  There's nothing more intimidating and nothing that eats at your self-esteem more than being  behind a bus full of, like, junior high school girls. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Because they will just fuck with you and pick you apart and laugh at you if you're behind  them.  You just got to get the fuck out of there.  They have no mercy on guys.  Forget it.  It's terrible.  They will fuck with your self-esteem.  They see a car pull up.  It's like, ooh.  And then all of a sudden they look at you and they go, oh, god.  Yeah.  It's like, ah, ha, ha.  Look at this guy.  I'm like, fuck you.  Yeah.  Bob and Sherry are doing well, though.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Because they're kind of the theme. 
[02:45:30]  That's why you drive around with your cock out of your pants.  Yeah.  And they look down from the school bus and they see it.  Uh-huh.  Nice talking to you.  I'm bouncing somebody.  That's being very nasty.  Why?  I don't know.  What were they saying?  I don't know.  They called me lonely and depressed.  Aww.  You're not lonely and depressed.  Inner thoughts.  Inner thoughts.  Old, washed-up radio host.  You?  Yeah.  I just, I just, I actually just deleted somebody, too. 
[02:46:00]  I bounce somebody, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bounce.  All right.  What's, uh, what's left with these fucking...  Well, they're just still talking about the blind date thing.  Oh, still right.  And how you never know.  It's the thing that, it's the thing to take away is you just never know.  50-50.  It's slim.  I think, I'd wait a half an hour, though.  Half an hour.  I had a first date and she was a half hour late because she was speeding because she was  late and she got pulled over.  No kidding.  And she showed me the ticket when she got to the restaurant. 
[02:46:30]  Did she blame you?  Did she blame you for this?  And then she got another one speeding away from me.  No, that really did happen.  That means the bitch got two motherfucking tickets.  Did you guys get that, though?  That was, like, one of their background guys.  It's like, well, you know, she met him.  She got a speeding ticket just because she was speeding.  She met him.  She's like, I gotta get out of here.  Not with this guy.  Yeah, self-deprecating.  Yeah, a little bit of that.  I mean, look, it's self-deprecating.  Yeah.  Not that bad.  Well.  I'll give him a swing. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  For self-deprecating.  Self-deprecation.  He could have ended.  He could have ended.  She got a thing for fighting and he went, and then she fucking left because she saw me  because I'm a hunk of shit.  Well, he didn't actually say hunk of shit.  That would have been better.  That would have been a little funner.  We should actually spice up their jokes.  We should punch up their jokes.  Cool.  Yeah.  Now.  No.  You tell me.  Yeah.  You want more Bob and Sherry.  Oh, sorry.  No.  God.  Because I'll tell you what the next track is.  It best not be, how long do you wait?  That's what the next track is.  Holy shit. 
[02:47:30]  How long did they do this?  Long, long, long, long.  This is terrible.  Long time.  All right.  Let's play it.  Let's just see if it might be good.  All right.  This is the last one.  And many of you were listening to us in cars this morning.  How long do you wait till you hunk at a car in front of you when the person is zoned out  at a green light?  Hour.  It depends how much Starbucks I've had.  Honestly, I'll answer that.  Oh, good.  One second. 
[02:48:00]  And I'm not kidding.  One fucking second.  And I beep at someone at a green light.  You give them to the count of one.  Yeah.  I give them one beat.  It's like, ap, bap, move, go.  I hate guys like you.  No, I hate guys that don't fucking pay attention.  You're right.  If you're at the front of the line, you have a responsibility to everyone behind you.  A responsibility.  What if you drop a penny?  Pick it up, you know what.  But no, you're being selfish because you're going to make it through the light.  You're the first one.  You're going to make it. 
[02:48:30]  If a guy honks at me too quickly, though, I specifically go very slowly through the light.  All right, asshole.  You're going to get pit maneuvered.  What?  I'm going to pit maneuver your ass into a fucking pole.  What are you from?  Police Academy.  Exactly.  And worse is if it's an arrow.  If you're at the front line of an arrow, you have a grave responsibility to everyone behind you.  To warn those cowboys.  To instantly step on that gas the second it turns green. 
[02:49:00]  If I'm at an arrow and I see that arrow turn green and I don't see a car making a left, bam!  I don't care if I'm ten cars back.  I'll get that chain reaction of beeping going.  I hate that.  Move!  I do too.  Yes, thank you.  What if you needed a kidney and right at the moment the light turned, you got a phone call, a text, that said we got a kidney.  How is the kid going to get around?  Because he has a knee.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  My kidney, man. 
[02:49:30]  I love that Chip can weasel his way into any kind of thing.  He really can.  How's the kid going to get around?  I fucking hate Chip.  Kidney.  Oh, boy.  It depends how much Starbucks I've had.  If I haven't had much, I'll give you ten seconds.  If I've had a grande, I'll give you a millisecond before I'm on the horn.  And I'm not just on the horn.  I'm yelling, green means go!  Green means go! 
[02:50:00]  Look out.  She's crazy.  Green means go.  Yeah, she's yelling like one of the chicks from Apocalypse Now.  Green means go!  I've yelled horrid things, usually with the windows rolled up, because I'm afraid of repercussions,  especially from what I'm yelling.  You don't yell green means go.  You yell what black or yellow means.  These are colors of a light.  Wait a minute.  I do call everybody.  I will drop an N-bomb in a second. 
[02:50:30]  And I'll call anybody that.  Like, it's just a nasty thing for me to say.  Like, I'll drop it in a second.  Just like, get out of the way, you!  Is that your asshole?  The N-bomb?  Is it your asshole?  N-bomb.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  It is.  No, it's just good morning.  Jesus Christ.  I will, fucking, in a second, though.  I'm like, yeah, you fucking...  And I blurted it out.  Yeah, who could enjoy your text message into the after show the other day?  Yes! 
[02:51:00]  I had said it probably as many times as who could did.  But you do it with...  You like the ER at the end, though.  I really do.  You like that version a little better.  I really...  And that's it.  I say the word like REO Speedwagon would sing it.  With a very...  I heard it from a...  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, you're...  Like, they really enunciate.  Yeah.  How would REO say nigger?  Heard it from a nigger.  I heard it from a nigger.  They would absolutely...  Who heard it from a nigger? 
[02:51:30]  Who heard it from a...  That's my...  That's my...  Yeah.  You were...  You were niggering around.  What's wrong with you, man?  Well, they do.  They enunciate their R's.  Oh, God.  Very R...  I heard it from...  Yeah, what are you going to do?  That's wrong with you.  I know.  I can't help it.  Yes, you could. 
[02:52:00]  No, I can't.  I am terrible.  I just want to hear you fight for it.  I, uh...  But I'm not...  I'm not prejudiced.  No, you're a sweet guy.  I don't prejudge based on just skin color.  No?  Like, I've met many a black person that is fucking great.  Right.  Very fun.  Yeah.  Very cool to hang out with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there are people like that young group that just sucker punched that poor old bus  driver in the face.  That's a clip that was on making the news rounds yesterday. 
[02:52:30]  Some bus driver is doing his job, driving his bus.  And, uh, there's a black kid standing next to the door, and a couple more coming up the aisle  after the bus stopped, and they're getting off the bus, and the last one that was getting  off the bus just wails the guy in the face.  Yeah, but you don't know what he said.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he could have been...  He could have been going...  Yeah.  Yeah, but he could have been fucking saying...  I don't think so.  Let me see it again.  Let me see it again from the beginning.  Shit.  Yeah, well...  You don't know what he...  The key was saying? 
[02:53:00]  Is he an old guy?  Yeah.  He could have been screaming, come on, you freaking niggers, let's get off the bus.  I don't think he was.  No, he was just saying that.  There's no sound.  Maybe he was singing that song we were just singing.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't think so.  What was this?  You don't know what he was saying.  Kansas City?  Oh.  So, take good care of you for me in Kansas City.  Did you hear about the teens in Detroit that were loitering and took over the gas station?  Yes.  Yes.  Did you...  I got a news story where they, uh...  I was...  Since we...  Teens.  We haven't mentioned the ethnicity. 
[02:53:30]  Uh-huh.  No.  Just teens.  Just teens.  Do you think the news did?  Uh, no.  Probably, yeah.  Do you want to hear it?  Sure.  Could you please play that?  Kill Bob and Sherry for the moment?  Please.  Yes.  How long do you wait before you drop the N-bomb in front of a bunch of teens at a gas station?  Will you tell me if you have an idea on the ethnicity?  Yeah.  They're teens.  Some call them thugs.  They've invaded and taken over this gas station.  Taken over this gas station.  They're about to put him out of business. 
[02:54:00]  On the air tonight, a gas station owner says a gang of young punks walked into his business  and refused to leave, scaring away his customers, acting like they own the place.  In fact, that's exactly what they told Fox 2's Alexis Wiley when she confronted those guys.  Oh, boy.  How would you feel if your business was being held hostage by a group of teenagers?  That's exactly what's happening at one Detroit gas station.  And the owner says these teens aren't just a nuisance, they're getting dangerous.  There's a lot of good people around here, you know? 
[02:54:30]  They're my customers.  He doesn't want his face shown.  We've dealt with them for years.  He doesn't.  But a lot of those good people don't come here anymore because this man may own this gas  station, but they're the ones running it.  This is Bad Crew gas station.  Bad Crew gas station?  Bad Crew.  What's that?  If you don't know, I can't even tell you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  This Bad Crew.  Bad Crew gas station.  Now I can't even tell you.  Bunch of teens.  Yeah.  Just hanging out at the gas station.  Where are the cops?  The cops chase them away, but then they come right back. 
[02:55:00]  The cops can't stay there.  Just hire a cop.  That's what the guys was thinking of doing is hiring security.  Yeah, listen.  This is where they're talking about the cops.  Take a look at what these teens do when they think no one's watching.  Teens.  30, 40 guys in front of the station.  Oh, boy.  Inside the store.  Destroying my store.  Destroying my business.  The store's surveillance cameras capture large groups of young men just hanging out inside  the store, smoking cigarettes.  This guy gets so comfortable that he sits on the counter and actually spits into the sink. 
[02:55:30]  The owner says most of this happens while he's gone.  The clerks are usually too scared to say anything, so they just quit.  I have four kids.  I can't even go and see my kids.  What do police do when you call them and they get here and see all these guys?  Well, see, when they come here, everybody leave.  Two minutes later, they come back and lowering again.  Undercover narcotics officers are here fairly often and teens are being arrested.  But as you can see, that's not enough to stop them or get them to care. 
[02:56:00]  Keep saying teens.  How do you know no one there is 20?  Yes.  Right.  Quite an assumption she's making.  Yes.  Ugh.  It's astounding the behavior that is accepted.  And people are frightened, petrified, and nothing is done about it.  Unbelievable.  Punching bus drivers in the face.  Shit like this.  Roving gangs of teens. 
[02:56:30]  There's such a cultural problem.  Just a huge problem that isn't being addressed, isn't being dealt with honestly.  I don't know.  And I'm the fucking, you know, I'm the racist asshole.  Well, white kids do this shit too, right?  Nope.  Sure they do.  Jesus Christ, that was fast.  Nope.  No, come on.  How long do you wait before you say no?  At least not on this scale.  Not on this scale.  Not like this.  I understand what you're saying.  And sure, there are gangs of white kids that are complete morons, assholes, dangerous. 
[02:57:00]  Same thing.  Not at this level.  Not at this accepted fucking behavior.  Yeah, but where is that?  That's in Detroit.  Exactly.  I mean, go through gas station footage of guys running into these...  The mobs.  Yeah, the mobs.  The flash mobs.  Again, I'm not saying white people aren't awful, but find me 10% of those groups that  are fucking white kids doing that.  You won't find it.  You're not going to find it.  And most of these surveillance cameras where you see hijinks and shenanigans going on in 
[02:57:30]  convenience stores, gas stations, you are going to see that it's going to be the minorities.  But it's going to be black kids and they just won't say it.  They just keep saying teens or young people.  It's funny, you type in flash mob into YouTube and all the black flash mob videos, it's always  violent or they're stealing something or they're taking over or something.  And all the white people flash mob stuff, it's like they're dancing in Times Square or  something.  They break into dance. 
[02:58:00]  Someone else made that point, too.  I'd rather be robbed than to have a bunch of fucking corny white assholes dancing in  my 7-Eleven.  They are ruining my business.  I'd rather have you take grape soda and Cheetos than to fucking dance in my fucking shitty  store.  The Ottawa Hospital White Coat Challenge flash mob.  Yeah, please.  I don't think they're really hurting anybody.  I hope a black flash mob and a white flash mob fuck up and meet at the same place one  day.  But that's why people don't want to open those. 
[02:58:30]  It's like fame.  Dance off.  Dancing on a fucking taxi cab.  That's my son!  That's my son!  Oh, God, I hated that.  Hey, Bruna, that's me, man.  Irene Cara.  Irene Cara.  That's why people don't want to open good stores in those neighborhoods.  Right, when they talk about businesses.  You're called a racist, but why would you want to try to run a business when that's  what's going to go on?  In a horrible neighborhood and bring the community and neighborhood up when they're 
[02:59:00]  just going to destroy the store, rob it, hang out in front of it, and chase the customers  away.  Wasn't the owner black?  It was, no, that was a neighbor.  Was he an Indian guy?  Yeah, yeah.  The guy who showed his face was a neighbor.  Do you think they'd do that if it was a black owner of the store?  Probably would.  You'd think so?  Yeah, black on black, there's no mutual respect.  The black on black crime is the highest, that's the highest crime rate in the black  community.  It's not black on white.  It's not white on black.  It's not Hispanic.  It's black on black.  And that's why when there's a shooting at a movie theater or a school, it gets so much 
[02:59:30]  attention, yet in one week in Chicago, you're getting that amount of people that have been  shot in, yeah, Chicago, Detroit, but it's black on black, so people don't really pay attention  to it.  They don't really care as much as they do when it's a school shooting or a movie theater  shooting.  It's amazing.  Well, it's not a solo black guy that's taking out a movie theater.  No, no, you're right, but the gang shootings far outweigh any of those shootings in a movie 
[03:00:00]  theater or a school, and it's usually innocent bystanders that are getting hit.  Not usually.  No, more times than not, it's some kid or grandma getting shot because these fuckers  don't buy good ammo.  They don't know how to aim.  Dude, that's in Boys in the Hood.  That's not a baby getting shot in the head every fucking time.  I read all these things.  There's a lot of it, man.  It's a lot.  It might not be more than the intended target, but these shootouts are in very crowded areas,  and they just are willy-nilly. 
[03:00:30]  They don't seem to care where their bullets go.  What is up with your fucking...  Why do you have these fucking old talky words?  I love talky like that.  What's wrong with willy-nilly?  Willy-nilly and hijinks and shenanigans.  I saw you were snickering at that one.  We were talking about these fucking crazy crimes and willy-nilly and shenanigans.  Yes, shenanigans.  Yeah.  You want to take a break?  No!  And then we'll...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got to piss so bad.  All right.  I'll cut my hands off. 
[03:01:00]  I got to piss so bad.  My eyeballs are...  What's that expression?  My teeth are floating, or my eyes are turning yellow, right?  I got to piss so...  My eyes are turning yellow, or my...  My molars are floating or something.  In Jimmy's case, my chest is turning yellow.  My bathroom floor is yellow.  My chin's popping out.  No, no, wait, wait.  Like a pelican.  Oh, no.  No, wait, wait, wait.  I got to piss so bad that, um... 
[03:01:30]  Oh, it's unflappable Jimmy.  My ears are twitching.  It's like unflappable Chip, really.  It's kind of a mixture of the two.  I got to piss so bad my fucking eyebrows are spitting yellow juice.  Take us out, you piece of shit.  This is the Opie Anity Channel.  What's Sirius XM?  Coming this fall.  Daytime TV is back with a bite.  Hell yeah.  Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving, and learning with Mike. 
[03:02:00]  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina.  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind  and hosts his own daytime TV show, giving dating advice.  That's how it is.  Everybody knows.  You stick with your ex, even though you break up,  till you find somebody whose sex is better or just as good.  Sharing personal experiences.  Don Keenan, give me my padeem.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you a grown man.  I ain't eating, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  And getting a little rowdy with the studio audience.  Fuck you! 
[03:02:30]  Fucking do it!  Yeah!  Mike lets the audience in on his more reserved, well-read side.  Yes, sir.  My diction's too precarious.  For your comprehension, I will endeavor to exclaminate more profoundly.  Yes, ma'am.  But he isn't afraid to let loose now and then, too.  Booga, booga, booga!  Booga, booga!  Weekday afternoons this fall, it's Mike.  Woo!  Hosted by Mike Tyson.  What do you say, champ?  What?  Series XM. 
[03:03:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is this Corrosion of Conformity?  I'll be the hi-hat.  I'll be the hi-hat.  Help me clean my wounds.  It's just the loop, too, right? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, I know.  Don't we tell Iraq all the time to...  Every time, play the song.  Is it Iraq or is it...  When I do play the song, you talk over it and go to something else.  So what?  What?  That's the point.  We're not regular radio, dumbbell.  Iraq, didn't we say so many times...  Every time, yeah.  ...that we want the real song and not just the loop?  You suppose that you talk over the song?  Yes, so what?  You're supposed to talk over the song.  Do you guys not like Iraq?  I love Iraq, but the shit...  Oh, did he just do that?  He switched it. 
[03:04:00]  Did you switch it?  Nice.  I think that works.  Yeah.  I can't hear myself.  Thanks.  I can't hear what Jimmy's saying.  You guys just said to play.  Exactly.  We're like the terrorists that take the guy, the prisoner out and go,  you'll go home today.  You'll go home today.  And then we drive around the block and bring him back into the prison.  Just to wear him down.  Yeah, we're Dustin Hoffman in the back of the car.  Yes.  Eric's thin tip fingers. 
[03:04:30]  With Bill Devane.  William Devane.  Who now, all you see him is counting his gold, that greedy bastard on those commercials.  Ah, gold.  He's riding his horse, flying a plane, counting his gold.  Bill Devane.  I don't have a vein kit.  Fucking Chip's an idiot.  Double capillaries.  Oh, Jesus.  Chip, you're an idiot.  Jumped up with capillaries.  I see the world through bloodshot eyes.  Who is this? 
[03:05:00]  Corrosion of Conformity.  Dude, you didn't know that?  I'm sorry.  I said, who is this?  You don't know who Corrosion of Conformity is?  This is what I call AAF songs.  They remind me of when I first got into this business, this crazy business called radio.  Love AAF.  It was great.  It was...  Waf.  Those were amongst some of the greatest times of my life doing that.  It was like such a new, weird experience coming from just fucking construction. 
[03:05:30]  And then all of a sudden, I'm fucking doing radio.  Wow.  It was great.  That's crazy.  And fucking, you know, I didn't have to go to Duluth or anything to start out.  It was great.  Duluth.  And just fucking, yeah, here's Boston.  Oh, your second market?  Yeah, New York City.  Isn't that the way it is?  The guys that go to school never really make it?  For the most part.  And the guys who just have talent, I guess they'd say.  It's like people who take comedy classes or who don't take them.  Right.  You gotta have that divine spark like you guys have for comedy, like I have for drinking. 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  And yapping.  You're a professional yapper.  That, too.  You're a very good yapper.  I like tacking.  Tacking, tacking, tacking for four fucking hours every ding-dong day.  Wait a minute.  We have one last thing with Bob and Sherry?  Yeah, I don't know.  A song parody?  I don't even want, I just, I want some closure here.  Yeah.  I want closure after that disaster. 
[03:06:30]  So let's polish the Jocktober segment up with Bob and Sherry.  Now, did they do this or is it a service?  They did it.  I believe they did it.  All right, look, I gotta give credit where credit's due.  Most people don't do their own song parodies anymore.  And it's about the NFL referee strike.  I hope they do a little shoehorning.  That's a good one.  What the fuck is that?  Shoehorning.  Go shoehorning at work.  That's Eric's old boss, Scott Shannon.  Scott Shannon.  Well, fuck it.  But Todd does all the song parodies.  Todd does.  And boy, can he put 50 words where two words go and make it sound completely stupid. 
[03:07:00]  It's like fitting 70 years into a 40-year-old face.  Exactly.  Nothing takes you out of a song parody like shoehorning words in because it takes the creativity out of it.  If you can't rhyme something and keep it in the same rhythm of the original song, the more it sounds like the original song, the funnier a song parody is.  Yeah, that's right.  The second it starts deviating from the song, it's no longer a song parody.  It's now just an original song that's goofy and it's not as funny. 
[03:07:30]  I know how to do it.  I'm a professional rhymer.  Are you?  Yeah, they call me that.  You are a professional rhymer.  I don't know any word I can rhyme with, anything.  Orange.  Orange.  Orange.  Oh, you want me to do it now?  Orange.  Porringe.  Cacarange.  That's not a word.  It is a word.  No, that's not a word.  I do it with other languages.  Those two.  Cacarange is another language.  It's a fruit in South Africa.  I've won awards for rhyming, but that's just because I got timing.  Wow.  Dude, I've won seven awards for rhyming, and that's just all the timing. 
[03:08:00]  That's the same.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't copy me.  That makes you sliming.  I'm not sliming.  You know what?  You're dropping on my diamond, and I don't appreciate your bad timing.  Shut up if I bend you over and break your hymen.  I'm going to make you suck my fucking lyman.  What's a lyman?  It's my balls.  He is terrible at this.  You should have said I'll fuck you in the mouth like Frankie Lyman, because that's a real  person.  Was Frankie Lyman not?  Yeah, sure it was, and I'll give you another one. 
[03:08:30]  My name is Roth comma Hyman.  Go to break.  No.  No, no, no.  Roth comma Hyman.  Go to break.  I'm only kidding.  I'm just kind of chiming.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Really not.  What's that?  Oh, nothing.  Now, we have a song parody from Bob and Sherry.  Oh, Mr. Alvazahari?  His first name is Hyman.  He snapped.  I like the snap.  I like that.  I like the snap.  Sorry, I'm sorry. 
[03:09:00]  I'm being terrible.  Don't catch me, Fox.  Bob and Sherry, NFL replacement referees song.  Just to summarize, the regular referees are back, as Sherry said, beginning tonight.  They've worked out their deal.  The lockout is over.  So they'll ratify it over the next few days.  But they got some money.  They got some pension.  So the regular reps are back for Thursday night and all weekend and moving forward an eight-year deal.  But it's kind of a send-off to the replacement referees.  This is K-Fan in Minneapolis with yet another Call Me Maybe rip-off video song in honor of the replacement referees. 
[03:09:30]  Through my wish, you know, well, got a call from Roger Giddell, want to ref the NFL.  I said I'm on my way.  I've trained my soul for a wish.  Personally, thank the commission.  Am I prepared?  They're already shoehorning.  Oh, yes.  Why would you fucking shut that off?  You're right.  Oh, God.  Who cares?  I'm on my way.  Coaches, stairways, holes, and ripped jersey skin with showing.  This call the whistle blowing.  Which way is the ball going? 
[03:10:00]  Save me.  I just met you.  That day was crazy.  What's his number?  Yeah.  Fucking hilarious.  Oh, you like it, Chip?  Yeah.  What is the song?  You don't know this song?  I just better know it.  Come on.  You better know this song because our own Sam Roberts broke this song on his program.  It's a great song.  It was broken on After Open Anthony Live and became the song of the song. 
[03:10:30]  It's Call Me Maybe.  I don't know.  What the fuck would I hear that for?  I love his disgusted face.  Have you ever taken a piss here?  Ever?  Yeah.  You've definitely heard this song.  So call me maybe.  It's hard to look right.  It's a great song.  Oh, I thought it said call the baby.  They had the little boy on the X Factor, and this was his song.  And what he does is he carries his computer around, and he goes on and does videos for  his fans.  Oh, I saw that.  And this is one of the songs. 
[03:11:00]  It's the fucking most disturbing.  And then another guy, a little blonde kid comes, what are you doing?  And he goes, I'm just going to make a video for my fans.  And then they put this song on.  Are they gay?  He was 13.  I don't know.  How do you tell if I'm fucking...  Richard was 14, okay?  You can fuck a 13-year-old?  What?  Richard was very gay, and that was fucking 14.  It's disturbing.  It's fucking sucks.  Joey Buttlicker was gay, and he was 14 also, and he put a fucking bedpost wooden thing 
[03:11:30]  right up his hiney hole in front of Richard.  What's wrong with that?  It's kind of gay.  Joey Buttlicker did that.  It's almost like sitting on the fucking spout that turns on the tub.  Have you done that?  No.  Girls apparently have lost their first virginity thing.  They come to the...  No, not the hymen, but they get their first orgasm in the bathtub with the bathwater, and 
[03:12:00]  they put their feet against the wall, and they have their little pussy snatch underneath  the faucet, and then they turn the water on warm, and just the water falling down onto  that gets them off.  Yeah, I can see that.  A lot of girls I've spoken to have their first orgasm like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty sexy when you think about it.  Yeah.  Kind of.  It's also sexy that it happened two weeks ago.  What?  That first orgasm. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, another one of those.  That's like my fat joke.  Yeah, it is.  You're right.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done, Anthony.  You're a fucking man among men.  You're a big, gripped-handed man.  Oh, boy.  With a helicopter.  With a helicopter.  Helicopter, a pool.  You want to see helicopters?  I use a shower massage on a very low, and I go-  On your pussy?  What?  Move your chair.  Move your fucking chair.  You just backed into Danny with your chair. 
[03:13:00]  I'm sorry, Danny.  That thing ought to beep when you back up.  See, it's a beepy joke.  I do.  A truck joke.  Okay.  I get it.  You would jerk off with a fucking shower massage?  I immediately had a fucking little girl joke, but I held back.  Of course you did.  I held back, though.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You ever use the shower massage on your balls from behind?  Never.  Never?  No.  It feels like somebody's tickling your balls back.  In the younger days, I think I would do that.  Like grab the shower massage in the shower. 
[03:13:30]  Get a little more stimulation, as they call it.  If you put it on very light and not hot, like warm, very light.  Like the one with the three huge fucking things of water come out and punch your bag like a fucking speed bag.  It feels like a fucking European soccer star is just kicking your nuts over and over.  No, I don't like that one.  That'd hurt.  That's not good.  The little sprinkles on your ball sack.  Yeah.  You know what sucks, though, is that coming in the shower, you have to make sure you come over the drain. 
[03:14:00]  You come on the soap and leave it for the next person.  Don't forget to wash your face.  Yeah, nothing worse than fucking stepping it in the shower.  What do you use?  You don't use a bar of soap.  You use the squeezy soap.  I don't use squeezy soap.  You are such a girl.  You don't use a fucking cup.  No.  What, do you hold it over your face and say, no, no, and then squirt yourself?  That's how he puts his toothpaste in his mouth. 
[03:14:30]  You're just cranking the crest tube until it's...  Yeah, we get it, Anthony.  I'm taking a shit and brushing my teeth.  You just use the liquid?  What do you put it on?  A washcloth and fucking go to town?  What do you do?  Put it right on the palm of my hand.  I jam my fucking three fingers up my asshole.  I turn clockwise three times.  And then I pull it out.  And then I flip it off whatever's on my fingernails.  No, I use a bar of soap and a washcloth.  Old school.  I bring it right back to fucking 1950s style. 
[03:15:00]  I have soap once in a while, but soap, I mean...  What, soap dries?  Anthony takes a bath.  It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.  Just a tub in the middle of the fucking kitchen.  Yeah, fucking one of those claw tubs.  Those claw foot tubs.  Yeah, here's some fucking Mexican lady heating up water on the back.  He's using a back scrubber looking towards the camera.  He has a gun on his dick underneath the foamy, foggy water.  It's got to come back to my dick.  Who is that?  There it is.  I'm in a fucking barrel.  A cut in half barrel. 
[03:15:30]  My horse is outside.  Jesus.  You still have your hat on and your boots?  Yes.  How did we get there?  How did we get to my bathing habits?  Jacking in the shower, not so much anymore.  Yeah, because you fuck.  Well...  Yeah, because you bang chicks.  You're single.  So you're not really jacking in the shower. 
[03:16:00]  I'm married.  Yeah?  Yeah, my fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm on.  When did you get married?  Five years.  Five years next week?  You jack in the shower?  Next week's my birthday and my anniversary, Jimmy.  What are you...  You coming over?  Happy birthday...  Get some yogurt?  Get some yogurt?  And by the way, I have a girl.  You have a girl.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But you fuck her.  What?  Shh.  I mean, you make love to her.  Shh.  Yeah, but having a girlfriend, having a wife, are two different things.  Not for another few days.  Shh.  Keep it quiet.  Oh, shit. 
[03:16:30]  On the QT.  Well, you hold hands.  No, that's fine.  It's okay.  I just...  I'm not allowed to take pictures.  Jesus Christ.  For a few days.  Are you kidding?  I'm not kidding.  Really?  Yeah, you can't take pictures.  Isn't that weird?  The age of consent laws are very strange in some of the states.  Yeah, they're a little backwards.  Yeah.  They're a little backwards.  Just not allowed to take dirty pictures.  Right.  So she has to shower a lot?  All right.  Dirty pictures. 
[03:17:00]  I get it.  Yeah, dude.  I jerk off in the shower a lot.  Yeah?  Well, it's the only place, too.  You have a house, too.  You gotta pick the fucking...  The things that come out of your leg hair?  No.  No cum on my shin.  I thought he was gonna say butt hair.  What are you...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm not saying you cum on your shin, but...  Eyebrow hair.  But the stuff does tend to fly.  What are you, a marksman with it?  No, I don't...  Hit the drain, bullseye?  No, I squat over the shower hole.  Oh, my God.  What do you look like?  And I drain it into the... 
[03:17:30]  A little Asian in a rice paddy jerk?  Yeah, I milk myself into the drain.  Milk?  So I don't have to clean it.  It's horrible.  Oh, that's terrible.  You're horrible.  When you jerk off, where do you...  You just...  On you?  And then wipe it off you?  All depends on what the cleaning situation's gonna be.  Yeah.  Or how lazy I am.  And whether or not a teacher is standing at the door.  Right.  That's why Bobo jerks off into the toilet.  Or I used a coffee cup.  Oh, God.  I used a coffee cup?  Well, yeah, you know what it is.  You don't want to drizzle your coffee. 
[03:18:00]  What is he fucking chewing tobacco?  Coffee cup.  I don't mind in bed on a towel.  It's so formal.  Oh, I like so many loads up a towel.  I'm not in a tuxedo.  What, do you have a butler?  He brings a fucking...  On his arm.  He just comes right on his arm.  Yeah, that...  That towel over his arm.  He just puts his crook...  His crook to elbow by my balls.  Fucking wipes down your stomach like you went to a spot.  Are you through, sir?  Will you be needing the car today, sir? 
[03:18:30]  Yes, sir.  The helicopter is prepped and ready, Mr. Cumia.  The bowl as well.  Thank you, Jeeves.  This is a wonderful load today.  That cranberry juice seems to be working.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've come on my towel so many times and it's on the floor.  You pick it up.  It's like a bow tie.  It's just hard.  A giant bow tie.  I've wiped so many loads off with towels.  A clip on it's preformed.  It never loses the shape.  God damn.  Yeah, mine looks like a fucking Pringles.  See, because it's crunchy. 
[03:19:00]  It's curved.  Jimmy's towel looks like a ghost that was frozen.  Yay!  Yeah?  Your towel looks like it's got a piece of shit on it.  Shut up, fucking angry chip.  Fuck you, chip.  Fuck you, you fucking hat.  What's the red thing on your hat?  A bunch of pussy juice?  That's it.  Holy fuck.  Oh, he's coming up for air. 
[03:19:30]  Bobby just spit water out.  Chip said he's coming up for air.  No, that was Jimmy who said that.  I heard it in Chip voice.  I'm sorry.  That's Jimmy humor.  Oh, fuck.  I had a chip voice.  That made me laugh.  That was a good one.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, poor Ange.  Ange is over at my house.  She goes, this conversation is making me uncomfortable.  She's the one that does my laundry.  Oh, really?  Ange, don't touch the towels on the floor.  It's towel day.  There's not a gun underneath that towel. 
[03:20:00]  It's just my cum.  No, I...  I got nothing.  Oh, no.  I haven't done it in a long time, Ange.  Do you ever jerk...  I don't jerk off on the towels.  Do you ever jerk off with a gun in your own mouth?  Do you ever...  Give me your money.  You won't get my money.  Show me your cock.  Oh, God.  What's your name?  Anthony Hall.  No.  I've never done that.  Do you ever chip your own teeth?  What's that?  Shut up, Chip.  There was one girl that wanted me to fuck her from behind while I held a gun to the back 
[03:20:30]  of her head.  Is that what you told yourself?  Yeah.  She was a stranger I met on the street.  She was crying, you had to pay her three grand.  Yeah.  But pussy was what?  Did you do it?  No, I didn't do it.  Really?  No.  Why?  No, because it's fucking not good gun protocol, first of all.  Oh, go fuck yourself.  And I didn't find it very hot.  Really?  I don't find shit like that, like...  Anthony loves when you send him naked pictures of girls holding guns.  Oh, God.  I get so many of those. 
[03:21:00]  Ant, is this your chick?  And I click it, and it's like, oh, there's a girl with a gun.  Wow.  He also likes everyday items in fun gun shapes or themes.  Yes, yes.  A barbecue or a mailbox gun.  Do you know what?  It's a clock shaped like a girl.  All right.  Is this your clock?  Do you know that Gage, one of my favorite porn stars, is really into guns?  And she has, like, videos of her shooting guns topless.  That's got to look funny in slow motion.  She's still around?  She doesn't do things anymore, right?  No, she's not into porn anymore.  I'd love to see high-speed video of a chick with giant tits shooting like a .50 cal. 
[03:21:30]  Did you see in the quiver?  You'd see the tits go like...  With the waves going through him?  Like when...  Great.  When they show, like, a fighter getting punched in slow motion?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or that guy that got the cannonball shot into him?  How great is Gage?  His belly.  Dude, she used to be one of my favorites.  She's still my favorite.  She's still my favorite.  She is pretty good.  Oh, my God.  Gotta give a credit.  She's the best.  She was really big in the 90s.  And she loves fucking...  Look at her take that cock.  ...sucking dick and guns.  You know who I love, too?  You know Anastasia Blue? 
[03:22:00]  No.  She needed the money.  She needed the money.  Right?  So you wouldn't hold the gun to a chick's head?  Oh.  Unemployment drops to 7.8%.  Lowest unemployment rate since January 2009.  Well, the Obama administration is going to be crowing about this one.  I think.  I think that's a lot of people leaving the workforce.  But we'll see what happens.  Who is that now?  Which one?  That's Gage.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, God.  She's adorable.  Look at her.  Suck that cock. 
[03:22:30]  Let me see.  She's adorable.  I can't because they've got it.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  I got you.  Where is she sucking the pecker?  Oh, don't worry about the curtains.  She's the best.  Oh, sorry.  It'll be me getting fired.  Not you.  Will it?  Sorry.  God damn these fucking...  It's just a bunch of pictures of a girl sucking the cock.  I don't like that cock she's sucking.  It bugs me, though.  What?  The one bottom left?  Yeah, because the helmet is too small for the girth of it.  Yeah.  Looks like a fucking old missile.  It looks like those Russian fucking dolls that one doll goes into the other one and goes 
[03:23:00]  Russian cock dolls.  It is.  It's a big fat cock, but the head is really small.  That's what Popeye's cock would look like.  Cock, cock, cock, cock, cock, cock.  It sucks me cocks.  Like the middle of his cock ate spinach and it didn't get to the end of his dick?  Yeah.  I know.  It looks like an old Pershing missile.  Oh, look at her.  She's the best.  And they have video of her.  She does a lot of babysitting ones.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  She's perfect because she looks like a little, you know.  She's a weird one, though, because I remember she would always have a lot of scenes with 
[03:23:30]  the same dude because I think her boyfriend or husband or some shit was in the business,  too.  Yeah, but I like that.  I got to respect that.  Like Rachel Rotten, she was the fucking same dude.  I like getting used to the same cock.  Oh, Rachel Rotten.  I don't like nine different cocks in a chicken.  Yeah, then she's slutty.  I love her.  This is nice.  You build a relationship.  I used to talk to them all the time.  No shit.  Oh, dude, I could beat off their videos all along.  Rachel and Rob Rotten.  I haven't talked to them in a while, though.  They're really nice people.  She lives in Arkansas.  Now I forgot what I was looking for. 
[03:24:00]  Now I'm just going to look up Rachel Rotten.  Fuck this.  Yeah.  Oh, do you know we have...  What do we have, Jimmy?  We have Johnny Rotten next week.  Yes.  Wow, that's amazing.  Johnny fucking Rotten going to be coming in next week.  What other guests do we have?  Do we have fucking Roger Moore and shit?  Not for a couple of weeks.  We're in November, I think.  I saw the trailer for the new Bond movie.  Skyfall?  Daniel Craig?  Is that what it's called?  Skyfall.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Looks good, right?  Daniel Craig is a great Bond.  Just a great Bond.  He is a great Bond.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  He's got acne.  What?  He's got fucking acne.  He's a rough looking dude.  He's not these pretty assholes they had.  He's gruff.  Yeah, I like him.  I saw a Bond documentary two nights ago.  It was amazing.  I want to just go see all the James Bond movies now.  Yeah.  I never really watched James Bond except, you know, a couple of Roger Moore ones and Daniel Craig.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I saw them growing up, but...  The middle one that Craig did was all right.  The first one was fucking amazing.  That was the first book, too.  The first ten minutes of that movie was stupid good.  What a great bathroom fight. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fucking smashing guys' face into the sink.  Yeah, and this one, I hope, is just as good.  Yeah, I like that.  You like Sean Connery?  He was good.  Yeah, it's hard to watch now.  It's kind of dated and shit.  He was good because he treated...  I don't know if you're into this, but he really just shut your face to women.  Oh, the women, yeah.  Yeah, he just really treated them like shit.  It was kind of...  You know, he was a badass.  He was going to shut your face.  Yeah.  He's really like that, too, I think.  Oh, man.  What is it?  Who's this?  Look at her.  That's Gage.  Gage is the best.  Gage is just three dicks, no waiting. 
[03:25:30]  She really enjoys peckers.  She is the best.  She's a little petite-y.  She loves big peckers.  No waiting.  What a good girl.  Yay, Gage!  Oh, my God.  You know how hard it is to keep a fucking rod in that situation?  I thought you were going to say, you know how hard it is to suck three cocks?  No, but how do guys keep hard like that?  I could never.  Really?  No.  I could.  She's pretty fucking good at work.  All she'd have to do is stare at the other guy's cock.  That would freak me out so much.  I love Gage.  She would be pushing.  Go back a little bit. 
[03:26:00]  Nope.  She'd get a little fucking nice tight.  She can't keep from gagging with three cocks in her.  Not with three.  No.  No AIDS cocktail had been sent.  Now she's got her ass up in the air.  The finger in her asshole.  Oh, she's just going to get fucked.  Jesus.  Is this after she got pregnant?  Did she take it in the butt?  Yeah.  She takes it in the butt.  She did one move where she did like a slow flip.  Oh my God.  It's like a sea anemone.  Like a what?  A slow flip. 
[03:26:30]  Like a sea anemone.  Sorry.  I just talked over you twice.  That's okay.  Three times.  I'm shutting up.  Sea anemone.  You got to to fight him.  Oh, look at that.  Come on, son.  All right.  I don't know if I could do that, though.  There's a guy in her ass and a guy in her pussy.  And the guy in her pussy is holding her up.  How could you, Bob?  You don't have her pussy.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  I don't know.  You've got two guys at the same time.  I never could keep an erection like that.  No.  These porn guys are amazing.  The one guy is holding her up.  The other guy is helping.  One's in her ass.  One's in her fucking pussy.  They're face to face. 
[03:27:00]  And they're both rock hard.  And their knees are touching.  I mean, obviously.  And this guy's just jerking off behind them.  Did you see that?  My fucking dick.  How the fuck?  My dick would wilt like a fucking bunch of bees landed on it.  What happened in her life?  What if she was raised properly?  She's so cute.  She's got a great face.  She's all nasty.  You know what she's got?  That white, sexy, white trash face.  Do you know what I mean?  Oh, look at her.  God damn it.  My favorite.  Her and Belladonna. 
[03:27:30]  I love Belladonna.  That's a good one.  I gotta give you that.  Gage is my favorite.  Whew.  Well.  What do you say, gents?  Why don't we all go to the bathroom now and just touch each other's dicks?  Yeah, let's try to fuck each other.  Let's all fuck Sam and see if we can recreate that scene.  Okay.  I get the ass.  You get the pussy.  Jimmy, you just stand there and jerk off in the background.  And then we all come in his face.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  All come in the sink.  We all come in his hair.  Wonderful.  And then he has to get it. 
[03:28:00]  Then we videotape him getting it out in front of an Apple store.  He gets another five million hits.  That'd be great.  So Bob will be where?  Brokerage?  Yeah.  Tonight I'm at McGuire's in Bohemia.  And Saturday night I'm at Brokerage.  But most of all, go to cheatamansguide.com.  Oh, right.  The book next week, we're coming in, me and Joe, next Tuesday, the day the book comes out  on the 9th, the pub date.  But you can go to cheatamansguide.com right now and check out a bunch of videos we made.  Oh! 
[03:28:30]  You can watch the movie that we made, me, Billy, and Joe.  And then the book comes out next week.  So...  All right.  And I will be...  My special's on Netflix if you want to watch it.  October 19th, I'm at Sunset Club Madrid in Vegas.  Uh-huh.  What is that?  It's Sunset Station.  It's a theater.  Oh, that's great, yeah.  And 25, 26, 27, I'm at Helium in Philly.  There's two shows Thursday.  A Thursday show's been added.  And I also booked Addison. 
[03:29:00]  There's a bunch of dates up.  My app's been updated.  Addison Improv?  Yeah, I'm doing that in November.  All right.  I'm just tired and unmotivated.  Very, very good.  What a fun time today.  And let's all gather right back here on Monday morning for another fun time.  Shall we?  I think we shall.  Thank you, of course, Sam Roberts.  Stay tuned for his, what I call, shit show.  But other people call it the after show. 
[03:29:30]  I call it the Bob and Sam show.  Danny Ross.  We'll go Sam and Bob.  Always a pleasure to have Danny Ross on the computer because we actually get to see things  that we want to see.  Unlike Sam Roberts.  He's eating my arm for some reason.  Some of us look up videos.  And some of us create them.  Speaking of...  Oh!  Speaking of eating, also thank you, Rob.  Oh, God.  On the board.  Speaking of eating.  Very good.  And, of course, the inimitable Bob, Kelly, Travis Teft, Club Soda, Kenny, and the shittiest 
[03:30:00]  employee we have, Sal.  I saw him there for two seconds.  He is shit.  Probably fucking something up.  What about...  And the crap, shit, fuck, useless interns.  I want to thank them.  What's the old Puppete hair up to?  Puppete.  The Puppete head.  And, of course, the most important people, you, the listener.  Thank you so much.  We'll see you back here on Monday.  It's Jerry Shepardini.  I fucking hate that.  Serious XM. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  And Bob.  The Bob and Sam Show.  The Bob...  Well, we'll go Sam.  We'll go Sam first.  I've been doing it.  I say we go...  Well, I've been doing it longer than you, actually.  Not this show.  Not this show, but radio itself.  Not as a host.  Bob and Sam.  You've been a guest for longer.  That doesn't count.  The Swab Show.  Where does the W come from?  Swab. 
[03:31:00]  Swab.  Sob is what it would be.  Sob.  Sob.  That's what our listeners would do.  Sambo.  Russian wrestling.  It's After ONA Live.  Woo!  Let's fucking...  Where's Anthony?  I want to fucking wrestle this kid.  He's our intern.  Anthony...  I like Anthony.  ...doesn't like that we have an intern, Anthony.  Why?  Because I was blasting him on the air a few days...  A few, I don't know, weeks ago.  Oh, my God.  And Anthony didn't like that his name was being besmirched.  I like Anthony.  He's got those fat lips.  Well, we should also introduce our guest.  I mean, she's your co-host on, you know what, dude? 
[03:31:30]  Kelly Fats...  No, it's Fat Kelly.  I don't like the word co-host.  Minion is better.  Minion.  Which sometimes they call me.  Fatsuka?  Fastuka.  Fastuka.  Fastuka.  Fastuka.  Fastuka.  She's Italian, too.  Yeah, I'm Italian.  That's why...  Fastuka.  Get Anthony.  We're going to make a fucking love match.  Anthony.  Anthony.  You go and do the intern work.  Let's explain what Anthony looks like.  First of all, he looks like he's from the past.  Right.  Yeah, he's like... 
[03:32:00]  He's a smart Italian guy back in the 20s.  Except he's got a Millennium Falcon t-shirt on.  Yeah, well, his face.  He's got slit hair, parted to the side.  He's got glasses.  Yeah, he looks like right before the stock market crashed.  Corner pocket there, Anthony.  Corner pocket.  Corner pocket, you fucking ginzo.  He doesn't know sports.  How are you doing?  You have a girlfriend?  You have a girlfriend?  He's not familiar with the corner pocket term.  He's like, I know how to do my hair.  That's about it.  Do you have a girlfriend in? 
[03:32:30]  I do, yeah.  You do?  What's her name?  Jessica.  Jessica what?  I'm kidding.  How long have you been with Jessica?  Do you call her Jessica or Jess?  Jess.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even sound like a guinea.  He does, right?  He doesn't look like...  He sounds like that.  How long have you been with Jessica?  That's when you were surprised the first time.  Listen, I'm talking to you, too.  Yes, I'm sorry.  It's Sam and Bob's show.  You listen to him first.  No reason to...  Just because Bob's significantly more famous and has a book coming out and all this...  Let's not get carried away.  ...doesn't mean that you should ignore my questions to answer his. 
[03:33:00]  That's ridiculous.  Now, how long have you been with this girl?  A couple years.  A couple years?  How old are you?  I'm 22.  Do you love her?  It's wasting his time.  Do you love her?  I'm done.  They're finished.  They're finished.  They're finished before you even ended.  Would you fuck this girl to the left of me?  Absolutely.  Let me finish.  In the ass.  I haven't partaken in that.  You've never fucked a girl in the ass?  No.  What kind of Italian are you?  No, I haven't.  You never fucking...  You know she's Italian.  Don't let the accent fool you. 
[03:33:30]  Fastuca.  Don't let that shit-happy accent fool you.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, so you would...  Even though you're with a girl right now, you would cheat on her with Kelly Fastuca.  Well, she's very pretty.  Really?  Stop it, stop it, stop it.  Look at what you're saying.  You're not saying, will you cheat on your girlfriend?  No, that's what I'm asking.  Would you fuck her even though you're in a relationship?  Like, you know, you just go to somewhere private.  Anthony.  Like, no strings, Anthony.  No strings, buddy.  Come on.  Yeah, you go in the sound booth.  She's literally throwing herself at you. 
[03:34:00]  You go in the sound booth, Eric turns his fucking back.  Up against the wall.  Up against the glass.  It's a small room.  Yeah, it's okay.  How much space do you need?  I don't know.  Are you going to be an acrobat?  Well, you already got a big Italian cock.  Is that what it is?  See?  Do you have a big dick?  No, it's all right.  Did that turn your mind, her saying that?  Yeah, absolutely.  Really?  It did.  You got a little plump?  It did.  It did.  A little something going on down there?  Half a chup.  Half a chup.  Did you feel the blood rushing down?  Yeah, that was a good one.  You got a little bass down there.  Boom, boom, boom. 
[03:34:30]  So you would cheat on your girlfriend with her?  I mean, you've known her for 30 seconds.  That's a fair statement, right?  Yeah.  If she held one of those knives that the crocodile Dundee had, when he went, that's not a knife,  this is a knife.  If she held that knife to your throat and said, let me suck your dick.  Absolutely.  She wouldn't need a knife.  Really?  Wow.  Does your girlfriend, does she listen to the show?  I hope not today.  Yeah.  Does she in general?  Well, usually I tell her if I was on, and today I'm not going to tell her.  No, because you're trying to fuck Kelly. 
[03:35:00]  Well, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I understand.  Do you make us good sauce?  Oh, my grandmother makes, she makes the best sauce in the world.  I might fuck you.  You won't have anything better.  I'll bring, I will bring you her sauce.  Really?  You won't have anything better, I guarantee you.  Really?  I guarantee you.  I don't know about that.  You call it sauce?  Oh, yeah, sauce.  It's great, it's amazing.  Gravy or sauce?  What's it called?  Sauce, we don't call it gravy.  No, there's no gravy.  No gravy sauce.  Just checking what type of Italian he is.  Yes, that's bad.  Is Jessica, is she Italian?  She's not.  She's Puerto Rican.  Oh, no. 
[03:35:30]  Okay, I'm not going to fuck you.  You're not going to get the shit beaten out of me.  She's innocent, though.  I don't know.  Kelly shows up for fucking my show.  She's got a razor blade fucking scar across her face.  So this relationship of yours can't be that great.  She has Anthony carved in her forehead.  Yeah.  So you never forget.  Yeah, and then his chick has a teardrop tattoo.  No, she's not like that Puerto Rican.  Oh, sorry.  Well, she's Puerto Rican and Cuban, but she doesn't look much worse.  She's a communist fucking Puerto Rican.  That's great.  Fucking trouble. 
[03:36:00]  So this relationship cannot be good.  If Kelly's in the mix, you know.  You started dating her when you were like 18.  Right.  You haven't even fucked anyone else.  I have.  I have.  Kelly's looking to teach you.  Yeah.  Kelly's like an 80s fucking movie where the tutor comes in and tries to help you.  Here, let me show you this way.  Whoa.  I like it.  Why is Kelly funnier on your show than my show?  I bring it out in people, Bob.  You really do.  This is what I do.  I need you to come on my show and help her. 
[03:36:30]  She's really sending out some zingers.  So this relationship is on the downward spiral?  No, it's not.  I don't see her that much because I'm here a lot, but where does she live?  Well, we both live in the same room.  I don't have her number.  You want to call her?  No, no, no.  I don't live together.  You live together?  No, we don't live together.  I go to school afterwards or I'm tired afterwards.  It's a struggle.  Are you afraid to go to her apartment late at night?  She doesn't have it.  She lives with her parents.  Are you afraid to go see her up there?  No, no, no.  Where does she live?  We're in Staten Island.  Oh, okay.  So you both live in Staten Island. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, we both live in Staten Island.  Are you going to take a boat home?  What a shitty life.  I take the bus.  What a shit life.  How often do you see her?  Over the past couple, since the internship, like once or twice a week.  Once or twice a week?  Sambo, this asshole that I have to take.  Just to fucking see seagulls every morning when he comes to work.  Fucking asshole.  This stinks.  He rides a boat to work.  No, I take the bus.  You take a bus from Staten Island to here?  Yeah.  How long does it take five days? 
[03:37:30]  No, it's quick.  Do they show a movie?  No, nobody's on the bus.  Nobody's pass out headphones when you get on the bus.  Nobody's on the highways at 3.45 or 4 o'clock in the morning.  Shit, that's what time you get here?  Yeah.  Man.  Well, no, I start taking the bus at 3.50 or 4.10.  So you get paid a lot of money to do that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, just...  How much?  I get paid nothing.  Nothing.  Zero dollars.  So you do this for what?  For hair gel?  For college college.  No.  The experience, Bobby.  The experience.  The experience. 
[03:38:00]  The rich experience of these interns.  Do you go to Staten Island College or something?  I go to Wagner College.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, hey.  Wagner.  Bobby, don't ever step the line.  Jesus.  I did go there for a little bit.  Now, Kelly, you were instantly attracted to him when he walked in.  Now I'm kind of like, ugh.  Not as much.  It happens.  It's like he's got this beautiful, you know, half Cuban, Puerto Rican girl at home.  He's like, sometimes I get home and I'm tired.  I see you like once or twice a week.  You should be fucking the shit.  No, but we both work.  We both work.  She's Puerto Rican.  She needs it. 
[03:38:30]  She's going to go somewhere else, buddy.  I'm surprised she's stayed with you that long.  And you're only seeing her once or twice a week?  It's more.  I'd be surprised if she's not fucking somebody else.  Yeah, she's fucking someone else.  Kelly's right.  I drove in the other day and as I was coming home for lunch, I made sure that I saw her  and we had lunch.  Yeah, I checked up on her.  Kelly, you should fuck her.  I know.  Yeah, what about would you fucking teach him a lesson?  But she works.  I work.  It's a lot.  I bet she works.  Yeah.  What does she do?  She works for a retail store.  Really?  In a mall?  In a mall. 
[03:39:00]  Is it in the middle of the mall or is it a store in the mall?  It's in the middle of the mall, but it's a store in the mall.  It's not a kiosk?  No.  You're spraying shit in your face as you walk by?  No, no, no.  Hello, papi.  You like to smell good?  Yeah, but you know how many guys she meets.  I don't know how much that is.  Do I what?  How many guys does she meet in a mall?  She works in a mall?  What do you have in your mind?  In retail?  Customer service?  Yeah, they have to be friendly.  They have to be in a mall.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  Hi, papi.  You like sunglasses?  Yeah.  Can I help you?  These are new from Pazal. 
[03:39:30]  They're like, what are you looking for?  Like, what do you want?  Oh, my God.  She talks nothing like that.  Exactly like that.  Look at your face.  I love the way they look on your face, papi.  I know I have a boyfriend, but I really like those black guys who work in the footlocker.  Those black guys are good.  No, she does not.  The footlocker guys?  No, no, no.  You know the footlocker guys?  No, the footlocker's on the first floor.  She's on the second floor.  It's a whole different ballgame.  You better make sure that stays that way.  Yeah, I know.  Because she's going to fuck a black guy when you're at work.  There's no way they don't go to the food court, and it's like lunch, and they go, 
[03:40:00]  they hit up Wendy's or Chick-fil-A or whatever's in the mall.  There's that sexy girl from Forever 21.  Right, exactly.  Hey, guys, could I please have extra mayonnaise on my Chick-fil-A original?  What would you do?  What would you do, Anthony, if you walked into the food court and you saw a hearse sitting  at a table with like six of the footlocker guys?  Just a bunch of black guys in referee shirts surrounding your girlfriend.  What would anybody do in that situation?  They're just my friends.  That's Jamal, and that's Laquan, and that's Juan. 
[03:40:30]  They're just my friends.  That's all right.  There's nothing going on.  Don't be so jealous.  What's wrong with you?  Tyrone is so funny.  I'm telling you, she talks nothing like that.  Yeah, she talks a lot like that.  Listen, I got you two sneakers.  They gave me sneakers for you today.  Yeah, they're a size 12.  I'm a size 8.  It don't matter.  They're for you.  It's the talk that counts, Daddy.  Why you got to be mean?  They're so nice.  It's so nice.  You make trouble for everybody.  I got you.  You're always so tired. 
[03:41:00]  I got you underwear.  These are extra large.  They've so what?  He gave them to me for nothing.  They gave them to me for free.  They're so nice.  They're so nice.  What do you mean?  They have cum stains in them.  So what?  You know?  Sometimes you clean stuff, you know?  It's free.  What's wrong with you?  They're discounted.  Does she call you papi?  No, she doesn't.  Does she call the full-on your guys papi?  Why date her if she doesn't call you papi?  I don't want her to call me papi.  The main factor of dating a Puerto Rican is that she's going to go, papi, why are you  so stupid?  Exactly.  Don't be stupid. 
[03:41:30]  I didn't know she was Puerto Rican until like four months in the relationship.  Your dick be flopping, stupid.  What are you being stupid for?  Your dick being stupid.  Your dick is stupid inside me.  It's going to come inside me, make a baby.  I see you one time a week and you come here, you be stupid.  Your dick is so stupid one time a week.  Seriously, what's wrong with her?  More times a week we see each other.  Yeah, but I mean, your glasses are stupid.  You're not so small.  How would she feel if she knew you were over here and you were...  And you were hitting on me? 
[03:42:00]  You're asking my guests if you could fuck them.  Sam, Sam.  He tried to fuck my co-host.  Your co-host?  The room with Eric.  He said, I would like to fuck you in there, but I'm going to need a little more room in  there.  Because my huge Italian cock.  Exactly.  And Kelly's over here.  Like, wow.  I mean, this is my first time, you know, on After O&A and I didn't know that this is  what was happening.  But then he said to her, I'll bring my grandmother's special sauce and you'll love it.  And wait till you get a load of my sauce.  And you know I used to be fat and special sauce does things to me. 
[03:42:30]  She did.  Yeah, you try to trick her.  You know that.  You try to trick fat Kelly with Italian sauce.  She's vulnerable.  And jizz.  Listen, when we first started here, Sam said, you have to be honest.  All right?  So you ask me, would I fuck her?  I would say yes.  First of all, I didn't axe you anything.  You did.  You're not talking to your girlfriend.  You're talking to us.  Stop trying to.  You axe me something.  He's trying to get his girlfriend back. 
[03:43:00]  You fucking axe me something.  I'll fucking tell you.  You axe me something.  I gotta give you the answer.  You're hanging out with these moulinions from Foot Locker all afternoon.  I walk in, you eat a fucking Chick-fil-A, you got dirty underwear, and you're hanging  out with these fucking moulinions.  Let me ask you something there, fucking Rondo.  And you know I'm not a size 12.  The fuck?  Don't you ever disrespect me, don't you?  I'll get this glass and I'll show it in your fucking eye.  Why you talk like that, folks?  I'll show it in your fucking eye.  You're so stupid when you talk like that.  I'll fuck you up.  Don't.  I was going to unfreeze some of my grandmother's sauce for dinner today. 
[03:43:30]  But I ain't doing that.  You don't deserve it.  You don't get my fucking grandma's sauce.  Don't you tell me what I deserve.  I deserve whatever you give me.  I tell you what, Raul gives me extra mayonnaise on my Chick-fil-A.  Come here, papi.  Stop being stupid.  And my Mickey Nuggies, he give me the Polynesian sauce.  Five of them.  I take them home to my...  You always get so mad.  You always get so stupid.  You stupid.  Why you fucking stupid?  I fucking hate you now, papi. 
[03:44:00]  Seriously, Anthony.  Why would you disrespect me?  Why you so mad all the time?  I'm tired.  Why would you disrespect Puerto Rican, Jessica, like that?  I'm not...  You're the stereotypical Puerto Rican.  That's what she sounds like.  You said she sounds like.  You said she sounds like a typical Rican.  And I was like, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  You say Puerto Rican here.  That's what you said.  You can't just say Rican.  You can't just say Puerto Rican.  I didn't say...  Why are you being stupid, papi?  You don't call me...  You were at the pool before Rican.  You don't call me just Rican.  Yeah.  You coming to my parents' house, trying to fuck me in my parents' house, and you too loud. 
[03:44:30]  I told you to be quiet when you fuck me in the ass.  Oh, that's right.  You never fuck me in the ass.  Because you a fucking homo.  You a homo.  You don't fuck me in the...  Gay men don't fuck their girlfriend in the ass.  I know Raul fucks his girlfriend in the ass.  I'm just saying.  I've never been there, but I'm just saying.  He ain't homosexual.  What's the matter?  You don't have balls swapping on your balls?  That's why you can't fuck in the ass? 
[03:45:00]  You need balls to hit your balls, papi?  I don't have balls, stupid.  I'll hang some fucking lemons down there if you get your dick hard.  But you can, because you're stupid.  Your dick's being stupid.  I will say this.  Italians, I don't know about the dick size, but we are known to have big balls.  Yeah.  Apparently.  That is true.  That's what you should look like.  That is true.  I think so, yeah.  Let me tell you something.  In your experiences?  I have Italian balls then.  Yeah.  My balls, sometimes if I sit to pee, I've pissed on my own balls.  Is that right? 
[03:45:30]  That's how small my dick is and how big my balls are.  Is that a curse, having tiny little giant balls?  No, some girls love big balls.  What about you, Callie?  Do you like big balls?  Well, I have big balls.  Great.  You do?  Yeah.  She's in.  Big, right?  Because they're too small.  I'm just like, what the?  I feel like I'm going to break them.  What if it's like a small penis and giant testicles?  Ugh.  Okay.  You slut.  Relax.  Because E-Rock, you know E-Rock.  Yeah.  He's been stripped down to his boxer briefs in here before.  And you can tell, he won't admit it, but you can tell from the bulge that he's all balls. 
[03:46:00]  Sorry, buddy.  He's got big balls.  But he might have a grower, not a shower.  Do you have a grower, Eric?  I do.  You do?  Yeah.  If you play with it a little bit, I bet a little Dutch cock he has.  Probably a nice five and a half inch Dutch dick.  Oh, yeah.  Five and a half inch.  That's when it grows?  Yeah, it grows.  Five and a half inch Dutch dick is good for Dutch people.  From little things, big things grow.  That's right.  I bet you it's all one color.  It looks like it's been dipped in baby powder.  It's just all pale white. 
[03:46:30]  One color, E-Rock?  Just white?  No pink at the tip?  He has an albino dick.  He can't take his dick out at the beach.  That's terrible.  Why can't you take a dick out?  Come on, papi.  What's wrong?  You going tan naturally like I can?  Your dick is powder, man, like that movie with the keyboard and spoon.  Can your dick bend a spoon?  Can your dick bend a spoon?  Your dick is stupid.  It's like a ghost.  Your dick should go boo when it comes.  Boo.  Is that what she sounds like? 
[03:47:00]  She doesn't.  Why would you come on here and disrespect her?  Is it to impress Kelly?  I wasn't.  There was no disrespect.  You asked me a question.  It's like asking me if I would fuck Jennifer Lopez.  You came on with your Italian dick swinging in the wind.  Exactly.  And trying to be like, oh, let me try to fuck Kelly today.  No.  No, that was not the plan.  I just thought I would come on and talk to her and make her feel comfortable.  Because you know I can't resist Italian sauce, too.  That's it.  I'm out.  She likes food and Italian dicks.  And you fucking came in with your big, fat Italian sausage.  I'm going to bring it in frozen, the sauce. 
[03:47:30]  I'm going to bring it in frozen.  And we'll unheat it.  I'll show you.  It's delicious.  Unheat it?  What are you fucking retarded?  Unheat it.  Anthony, why are you getting...  I put it in the freezer to unheat it.  Bobby, it's not unheat.  You put it in the freezer.  You defrost.  Defrost.  Defrost.  Unheat.  Unheat it means to make not hot.  I bet deep froze.  You're so dumb you shouldn't be able to wear glasses.  You should be forced to wear fucking contacts.  Because you deceived me, Anthony.  Unheat it.  With the word ask and fucking unheat it.  He puts on a Millennium Falcon t-shirt and his thick framed glasses and he thinks people 
[03:48:00]  are going to think he's smart.  He's trying to trick.  He's trying to trick people.  Right.  I swear, I'm like those Big Bang Theory guys.  Let me tell you something.  I fucking love Star Wars, Star Trek, and Firefly.  You know what I love?  My favorite shows.  You know what I love?  Matt.  Love Matt.  Let me tell you something.  That fucking lightsabers.  Lightsabers.  The double one?  That shit.  Fucking blew my mind.  Blew my fucking mind.  And it takes a lot to blow this mind to mind.  Let me tell you.  Let me ask you a question there, though. 
[03:48:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you.  Say someone had a bunch of fucking Star Wars toys, right?  Right.  Right.  Right?  I mean, where could you do with those?  You make a little fucking million?  I'm Anthony, the Italian geek.  Yeah.  I'm fucking Anthony.  What we do here is we get fucking toys and such.  Yeah.  Right?  Fuck cars.  Fuck prostitutes.  Let me explain to you the difference between a comic and a graphic novel.  One is thick and one's thin.  Yeah.  This has binding, my friend. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  This binding.  This shit you can't just stick in your back pocket like a fucking weapon.  Let me see you try to roll this shit up.  Yeah.  That was a bit black in her head.  A little bit.  Let me see you roll this shit up.  Yeah.  One time I called my girl banging the whole fucking Foot Locker crew.  I went in there with my fucking Yoda shirt.  I said, hey.  Hey, you fucking.  Let me tell you something.  You fucked my girlfriend?  I'm going to go to Spencer's gift and get me a treat. 
[03:49:30]  Right now.  Yeah.  A joke.  A fart.  I'm going to get a whoopee cushion.  That's what I roll.  I put it on the fucking train.  Old lady said, we all laugh on the fucking train.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get a blacklight poster.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm Batman.  Fucking boom.  I put the light on it for 10 seconds.  Shut the lights out.  Forget about it.  Forget about fucking Anthony.  Forget about it.  I'm Anthony the fucking Italian nerd.  And then I comb my hair down again.  So I'm not out of place.  Yeah.  I pop my hair to the side, you cock suckers. 
[03:50:00]  Not down the middle.  I don't do fucking pompadours.  And I did a little flip at the front.  I wear baggy jeans.  Fuck true religion.  Diesel can suck my dick.  I'm a geek.  I don't know any better.  I wear fucking...  My mom gives me her jeans, and I wear those, because she has big hips.  And I want to appear like I have big hips.  That's right.  Anthony, the fucking Italian nerd.  Fucking Anthony, huh?  Come to my house. 
[03:50:30]  This is what we had to deal with.  I hope.  I have a stress factor the other day.  First of all, don't plug gigs that already happened.  I'm just saying.  If you're ever going to plug a gig, you plug the gig tonight at McGuire's.  This is what you're going to have to deal with in Long Island this weekend.  Yeah, this is exactly.  This is what you're going to have to deal with in Long Island this weekend.  Yeah, this is exactly.  And you're at the front table.  If you're going to Barnes and Nobles on Tuesday, this is what you're going to have to deal with  when you read Cheat.  Cheat, a mansguide.com is out there now if you want to watch the movie and buy the book.  If you want to deal with this.  Buy fucking five books. 
[03:51:00]  Not just one.  I fucking fell off a truck.  I got books.  I got fucked VCRs and TVs.  I got books.  I fucking reading is fundamental, you cocksuckers.  Riff.  Riff, motherfucker.  Seriously, though, Anthony.  I mean, Kelly's in here as a guest today.  Yes, yes.  And she hasn't done the after show before, and my goal was to make her feel comfortable  here, you know, so she could come back and be, you know, one of the gang and just at  ease.  And the minute you walk in, you're like, oh, you're looking for a fucking? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, I'm going to say, Sam, I mean, that's pretty unprofessional of like an intern.  An intern.  Is that what you do?  You come in with your Italian cock, your massive Italian cock swinging?  Yeah.  Wouldn't no make her uncomfortable?  Does she look like that type of a girl?  Is it because I'm an immigrant, because I have an accent, you think you can't, you can  treat me like you treat your girlfriend?  Yeah, because she's, your girl's a Puerto Rican, she's an Australian fucking dirt prisoner  monger from that shit country, and you can just take advantage of these women?  Yeah, I mean, that's...  You think people from other places are fucking dumber than us? 
[03:52:00]  I was just being...  Dumber than you?  Yes, they get really dumb.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I was answering a question.  That's bullshit.  That's fucked up.  You hear an accent, and you're like, I'll take advantage of this, brud.  Yeah.  I'll let her believe that I'm going to marry her for a green card, so she can stay.  I'm going to pause my...  Get it out, Bobby.  You got it.  You got it, buddy.  Come on.  You can do this.  You can do this.  My NPR app.  I'm going to pause this sophisticated conversation about the subtext of movie plots, and I'm going 
[03:52:30]  to rape this bitch.  Because that's what I do.  You know, Kelly has been on a show, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  If people are familiar with this voice, if you remember...  Eric, see if you can find a quick clip.  Eric, you remember Kelly's first appearance.  Yeah.  See if you can find a quick clip of it.  Oh, boy.  Please, I hope it's cherry darts.  No, did you not know...  And the cherries kept falling in her asshole.  Where'd the cherry go? 
[03:53:00]  Where'd the cherry go?  There's not even whipped cream.  My asshole just sucked it up like a suction...  Yeah.  Her asshole went, feed me, Seymour.  We've had some filthy whores in here, but this is unprecedented.  The cherry disappeared.  I didn't even think she shut it out again.  No, it's just gone.  Her asshole looks like a Venus flytrap.  It's like the abyss.  Nothing ever goes in, nothing ever comes out.  No, she was...  Bob Kelly, I don't know if you know this.  I don't.  She was on with Bobo.  She was in here one day. 
[03:53:30]  She was randomly up here.  I think it was that guy from Australia.  Yeah, it was Nick Cody.  Right, Nick.  He's like our Australian super fan who hasn't been up here in a while, but he used to...  He's coming in November for some shows.  Okay, cool.  So he'll have to be back up because he's been up a few times.  He's the Opie and Anthony representative down under.  He's our guy down there.  What do you fucking mean?  You have a guy?  Nick.  In Australia?  He tells all the Australian people...  To listen to ONA.  Yeah, you gotta listen to this show.  Oh, that's great, man.  So she came up with him and Bobo was in here and another... 
[03:54:00]  He's fucking...  Every time he signs on to Twitter, some dude is pretending to be a girl.  I'm like, I love you, Bobo.  I want to show you my tits.  And Bobo goes, oh...  I do...  And so he thought...  He was told that a girl was gonna, I guess, meet him at the studio or something.  And we found out about it and we told Kelly to pretend to be that girl.  No shit.  Was it Fat Kelly or this Kelly?  It was Fat Kelly.  Oh, she was the fatty back then.  Yeah.  I mean, she wasn't that fat back then.  Let's not get carried away. 
[03:54:30]  If you're gonna fuck a chick, she's fat.  Okay.  All right.  Let's call it what it is.  I would rather bang Fat Kelly, to be honest with you.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Than this Kelly?  Bobo had no problem with her.  Yeah.  This Kelly's fucking shoulders bugged me.  Fat Kelly was pre-Anon Fisher, too, so...  Yeah.  Kelly...  I like Fat Kelly.  She filled out.  Yeah.  Would you like Fat Girls?  No.  Oh, really?  Oh, sorry.  Keep the weight off, funny idiot.  I will never put on weight.  I know the pressure.  Put the fucking bread down, you fucking Australian whore. 
[03:55:00]  I forbid I get pregnant when one of your fucking speedy little sperms impregnates me,  little Italian whore of the whole sperm.  Kelly's...  All right, slow down, Kelly.  You start saying fuck you, Rick.  You're getting too fast.  Slow down.  Did you bring Bobo to orgasm that day?  I think there was something going on there.  I couldn't look at it.  I had my head turned.  You saw Bobo's penis?  No, no, no.  Anthony was trying to get me to turn around, but I was like, yeah, sorry.  I'm fine.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to say this.  You've seen her body.  I'm just laughing.  They wore pearls to the Sam Roberts show. 
[03:55:30]  Of course she did.  What the fuck?  And she has perfume on and everything.  She's dressed to and fro.  I like that she dressed...  Kelly's a pretty girl.  Yes.  She dressed pretty.  But why pearls?  What the fuck?  It's the after show.  Because it's like, you know, I'm trying...  It's the media.  It's show business.  It was her red carpet out front.  Yes.  Look at that date.  Hey, get those fucking pearls off.  If my chick sees those, I gave them to her.  Bobby, where's my pearls? 
[03:56:00]  Not because I'm wearing jeans.  I'm dumbing it down.  So it's okay.  Okay.  Do you have underwear on?  Yeah.  Is that all right with you, Anthony?  That's fine.  Okay.  What kind of underwear?  Is it G-string?  Say that again, Kelly?  She will.  I don't want to fuck with this kid.  Say it again.  Because he's only 22.  He's so young.  And I'm like, you don't even know.  How many girls have you been with?  A few.  How many?  What's the number?  Three.  One Puerto Rican counts as six regular white chicks.  Right.  Because of all the empty cock that's already in there from the guys before.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:56:30]  No.  God.  Jesus Christ.  I'm all the fuck like that.  That's a terrible thing to say.  It's probably true.  It is probably.  But it's just a terrible thing to vocalize.  You don't fucking hear after all the footlock and cock is being dead.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Kelly.  Settle down.  No, but I mean, that is awful.  It's probably also true.  I think it's true.  We need to all settle down.  Now.  We need to bring it back.  Because I don't want fucking anybody getting shanked.  I don't want a pit bull attack.  When were you first with a woman?  Intimately.  16, 17.  16 was the first time you got some. 
[03:57:00]  No.  You dick touched or you had sex?  Yeah.  Probably like 15.  Probably dick touched 15, 16.  Normally Italians get that done earlier, though.  They normally do it at 13.  Is that right?  When did you?  Anthony did.  Anthony Cumia, then.  I got it done at, I think I got the first dick touch in first grade.  Yeah, but that was when you first touched someone's dick.  No, no.  That was after.  It was a guy.  I'm not fucking gay.  I was molested.  We bring that up just a goof.  Yeah, people just bring it up as a goof.  Yeah.  Dude, I got a steak. 
[03:57:30]  Thanks.  I opened it.  Oh, man.  I got molested in a closet.  Yeah.  It's all fun, Bob.  It's all fun.  The shit fan base of this show is like, dude.  Hang on.  It's all in fun.  What do you got?  We got a clip of Kelly and Bobo together.  Please.  And you've never heard this, Bob.  This is your co-host on the You Know What Dude podcast.  Worst accent on the planet.  Here it is.  Bobo, why don't you say hello?  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi.  How are you? 
[03:58:00]  How are you doing?  I forget.  What's your name?  How do you pronounce your name?  I pronounce it Allie.  It's very good to finally hear your voice and stuff.  I listen to you all the time.  Yeah.  It's good to hear you, Allie.  Hey, this might sound really weird, but I'm actually outside the building.  I heard you guys talking, and I thought maybe I'll come down.  She just toyed with Bobo's heart and emotions.  That amazes me.  Can we just stop for a second?  Let me stop for a second.  I don't like that Kelly tried to get on the O&A show first and then failed and then got 
[03:58:30]  on my show.  And now she's trying to get on your show.  I guarantee.  If you said to her, Kelly, just come on every week, I'd be done.  She'd be gone.  You were like, I'm doing the podcast.  I got some comics coming in.  I go, oh, okay.  I'm checking out who it is.  I go, that's the Bobo girl.  She's the Bobo girl.  That's the Bobo girl from before.  I would never do that to you, Bobby.  Hideously loyal.  She's fat Kelly to me, the Bobo girl to you, and what is she to you, Anthony? 
[03:59:00]  Fucked all.  I don't want to say anything anymore.  I mean, that's what you treated her like.  The best five minutes of your life.  Exactly.  How long do you think you'd last with Kelly?  I can go pretty long.  Whoa.  I don't want you to go long.  No, like, you'd leave her store?  You'd, as they say in hip-hop, beat that pussy up?  Exactly.  Yeah.  I'd try my best to.  As they say in Foot Locker.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want a fucking jackhammer.  Dude, I'd beat that pussy up.  Yeah.  Oh, that's his son.  You know that chick?  Bobby.  That chick that works his sunglass hut? 
[03:59:30]  That bitch is fucked up today.  They beat my pussy up.  True, don't beat my pussy up.  Oh, my God.  I'm, like, so sore today.  Like, people, like, beat the shit out of me.  Like, in my pussy.  That bitch wasn't sitting right on the ferry today.  Hey, she had to stand by the window.  Eric's got another, uh...  You take a boat to work.  It's ridiculous.  Seagulls are just flapping and smells like garbage.  Do you make out with it on the way home from work? 
[04:00:00]  The way home from Manhattan?  I bet you this cocksucker has a briefcase.  Of course he does.  I bet he has a briefcase.  That clicks.  I have a cross-body bag.  He has a briefcase.  He does.  And a fucking rain jacket and an umbrella.  Even when it's not raining.  I don't know.  I take the boat to work.  You never know.  Eric has another Kelly and Bobo clip.  As we go into the past of Kelly.  This is two years ago.  Fastuka.  Fastuka.  Yeah, this is from November of 2010.  Jesus.  Man. 
[04:00:30]  Here she comes.  I just moved here.  There's Allie.  How you doing, Allie?  How you doing?  Great to see you.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he's kissing her cheek?  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Oh, yeah.  We had to tell Kelly.  Pause that for a second.  We had to tell Kelly.  I was outside with Kelly acting as the producer of the segment.  And I was telling Kelly, don't worry.  She goes, well, I don't want him to touch me.  What did she say?  Well, she said it in her accent.  I don't want him to touch me. 
[04:01:00]  That's not.  What are you, Sherlock Holmes?  It's all the same.  No, it's not.  I don't want him to touch me because I don't like it a lot.  That sounds like you're doing your accent to me.  Let me tell you something.  My fucking from Manchester is my team.  And I don't like him to touch me.  We had to tell her.  Don't worry.  He's not going to touch you.  It's all good.  Just go on in the studio.  And then this is what happens.  A minute.  I'm kidding.  This is a surprise.  I know.  This is fantastic.  This is a lovely gift.  This is a lovely gift. 
[04:01:30]  It feels like Christmas already.  Like a rapist.  He's laughing at me.  Momo, you are looking her up and down like a vulture.  She looks nice.  I look pretty good.  This is the first time I get to see her.  This is the first time I have an image in my head.  She smells good.  When I get reminded of her, this is the image that's going to be in my head.  By reminded, he means jerking off.  Momo, it's radio.  Describe what she looks like.  She's got brown hair. 
[04:02:00]  It's blondish red.  She's got glasses.  Right.  She's wearing...  You like the glasses, yes?  Yeah, I like the glasses.  You look great with the glasses.  What else, Bobo?  She's got...  She's got a purple...  She's got a purple button in there.  Patrice.  We got it.  Patrice is in.  Yeah.  Yeah, Patrice and Colin were there.  Oh, my God.  But, Bobo, did you hear the joy?  Yeah, that's fucking...  In that retard's voice.  That's fucked up.  What he did to him.  Do you think he still jerks off thinking about you? 
[04:02:30]  Oh, man.  I don't want to even...  Like, I think I maybe messaged you about it because I was feeling really guilty.  And you were like, he's a goldfish.  You forgot about it.  Yeah, yeah.  He was a goldfish.  That's what happens.  Oh, my God.  You just talk to him about the Mets after he leaves the studio, and he's good to go.  That's some fucking greatly described fucking stupid people like that.  Yeah, no short-term memory.  That's fucking fantastic.  We just clean the slate.  No problem.  Thank God, because I'm going to hell.  He's showing a hot pocket.  Yeah, exactly.  Hot pockets?  You know those men in black sticks they have that zaps your memory out? 
[04:03:00]  Did you just show them a picture of, like, a bear?  It's the same thing.  It went on for, like, 45 minutes, and he was like, I'm taking you out.  And then we're going...  Colin was doing his Broadway show.  We're like, Colin, give us some free tickets.  He's like, I don't want to be a part of this.  Oh, I remember that, because then Bobo kept calling the office, and we were like, Bobo,  yeah, I don't think she's calling you anymore.  And he was like, well, do I at least get the free tickets?  Oh, motherfucker.  And you said no to that, too?  We were like, Bobo, we don't have any tickets.  Oh, my God.  Did you get him a movie ticket? 
[04:03:30]  No, no.  Did you get him any?  No.  Did you get him a ferry ticket to fucking Staten Island?  Make a ferry ticket, go, you get it for free.  But then Patrice was trying to pick me up the whole time, because I was a big, and my tits  were huge back then.  Yeah.  Those were the days, huh?  Dude.  If you fucked Patrice, it would have made me so happy to know that he fucked you.  Yeah.  And I know he wouldn't have fucked you.  He would have fucking, I'll tell you what he would have done to a girl like you.  He would have fucking ate your pussy, made you cum a bunch of times, and maybe you would 
[04:04:00]  have licked his nipples, and he would have jerked off on your fucking face.  Jesus.  All right.  Imagine if you'd had that story.  Yeah.  That'd be a great story.  I would love it.  Fucking great Patrice O'Neal.  He came on my tits.  I fucking jacked on my face.  We have to end the week on that.  That's the end of the show.  Oh, no.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Kelly Fatsuka.  Fatsuka.  Fatsuka.  Where can they find you on Twitter?  My name, Twitter, it's Kelly Fatsuka, which is K-E-L-L-Y-F-A-S-T-U-C-A.
