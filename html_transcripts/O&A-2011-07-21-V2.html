<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts in the absence of Opie and Anthony, featured a highly unstructured and chaotic broadcast.  In-studio guests included DJ Who Kid and his cameraman, "Will I'm Not," along with several other unnamed individuals who came and went throughout the show. The conversation meandered across a range of topics, often shifting abruptly.  Early discussion included humorous, albeit insensitive, speculation on the impact of Osama bin Laden's death on Jordan's stock market and the perceived reactions of Black consumers.  This segued into NBA playoff predictions before veering into Who Kid's personal life, specifically detailing his dating experiences and encounters with women of various races, peppered with sexually explicit anecdotes and offensive racial slurs.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a detailed plan, and subsequent execution, of having YouTube lip-syncing star Kenan Cahill perform live on air.  This event was repeatedly lauded as "brilliant" and unprecedented.  The lead-up to Cahill's appearance included discussions of Who Kid's connections in the entertainment industry and the potential for future collaborations, as well as speculation about the reactions of various bosses, including Opie himself, to Who Kidâ€™s often offensive and provocative behavior and comments. Anthony's recent hair transplant surgery also briefly entered the conversation.

Throughout the broadcast,  racial slurs and sexually suggestive comments were frequent.  Kenan Cahill's appearance and stature were also the subject of ridicule from the hosts and guests.  Cahill's live lip-syncing performance constituted a major segment of the show,  after which he departed for a scheduled appearance in Times Square. The overall tone of the broadcast was highly informal, disorganized, and characterized by pervasive vulgarity and offensive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The worst of After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  You know what it is.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  You already knew that.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You already knew that.  Opie and Anthony have left the studio as they always do,  and quite frankly so have I.  I know it's weird because you're hearing me,  but what you don't understand is this isn't as live as it usually is.  I can't do the show today.  I mean, this part is new, but beyond this, there won't be much more  unless you haven't heard some stuff. 
[00:00:30]  Then it will be new to you, too, which is impressive, I guess.  But like I said, I can't do the show today,  so instead you're going to be treated to some of the best After Opie and Anthony material  as well as some of the best Opie and Anthony material.  Of course, we call it the worst because it adds a sense of irony and humor to it  that wouldn't be there otherwise, but it is indeed the best.  So without further ado, and we'll be back, of course, live on Monday, as always. 
[00:01:00]  However, in the meantime, we treat you with this, the very best,  well, the worst, but it means the best, of After Opie and Anthony Live.  The worst of After Opie and Anthony Live.  That's Who Kid.  Come on in, Who Kid.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Who Kid's been on this show before?  And that's his cameraman, who he calls Will I'm Not.  Fuck.  What about Kenny?  He's sitting there really impatient.  Tell him to call in.  He could join the show.  We left early today, Kenny.  Give me a minute.  Who Kid's? 
[00:01:30]  Look, I got real guests on this show.  I got, oh, you can grab that mic if you want.  Yeah, Mars isn't going to move.  I don't know why Mars is staying.  Don't let the black guy use Anthony's microphone.  I don't want to hear that tomorrow.  Take my mic, man.  I don't want to hear that tomorrow.  Take that mic.  You know how Anthony is around.  That's a racist mic.  I'm sorry, man.  And then they'll be like, see, he doesn't like him.  He allowed the black guy to use his microphone.  I'm sorry, man.  You know how Anthony is.  Sorry to point out you were black, by the way.  A lot of Who Kid's listeners think he's white because, you know, he's white on the inside. 
[00:02:00]  What's the black take on the Osama bin Laden thing?  These skeptical black people don't believe this shit.  Not only are we skeptical, but, you know, there's news that he had a pair of Jordans on.  What?  What?  So we know why they killed him for it.  Are you fucking around?  Yeah.  Like Jordan's stock went up like crazy right now.  Are you fucking around?  All the black people were buying Jordans.  I just bought three pairs.  I don't even care.  Yeah.  I just bought three pairs.  You've got to be in because you've got to be up on this. 
[00:02:30]  It's amazing.  You can't let this pass by you.  What else was he wearing?  The Osama.  That's what they're calling him.  Any LeBron shit?  Nah, no LeBron shit.  That's all about you.  Fuck Miami.  Yeah, that's what Osama was saying.  Fuck Miami.  Allah.  I'm getting nervous with this Miami thing.  I don't know, man.  Fucking Boston's not going to beat them.  I don't know, man.  I do not want them winning this fucking game.  Oh, bro.  I'm getting nervous.  So you got a big bet or embarrassing conclusion? 
[00:03:00]  Nah, I just have feelings for Cleveland still.  Oh.  I'm on the Cleveland side on this.  Who do you think wins?  I was assuming L.A. might take it again for the last time.  A little old, though.  A little old.  It'll be kind of old.  I think this will be the last L.A. takeover.  For how long?  Nah, that's it.  That's it.  I mean, they're not really the same.  That'll be it for a few years.  He's right.  They're about ready to be on the downside.  Look at all these new guys coming out.  These new teams are heartless, yo.  Oklahoma?  What?  Oh, my God. 
[00:03:30]  Chicago?  100 and over every game?  This guy's a heartless, yo.  Yeah.  I heard a rumor.  Can I go home?  No, no, no.  Kenny's going to kill me.  Well, let him kill you.  I mean, you know.  Kenny, I just need you to take my coat.  He's going to be really mad at me.  He's just waiting so I can.  I want to walk light today.  You're the guy.  I want to walk light today.  You know the kid on YouTube?  I'll be honest.  He's waiting there just so he can take my coat and my iPad.  But that's his job now.  He's not a cop anymore.  This is what he does.  This is his life.  He's going to be really pissed at you, Sam.  He's a big, tall, white guy.  Dumb guy. 
[00:04:00]  He stands outside our door.  Why do you got to be dumb, man?  I don't know.  He just is.  So, man, you have my favorite cook in here, man.  Oh, guy?  Guy?  Well, you know.  He turned out to be really cool.  I know who you got today.  You know that kid on YouTube?  The lipsticks.  Who's he got?  That kid who's short and he's got the big head and he's got thick glasses.  You got him?  Yeah, he's hilarious, yo.  He's mad cool, yeah.  Is he going to be up here?  Yeah, he's going to be up here Saturday, actually, on my show.  Hilarious.  That fucking Waterhead's going to be here?  He is funny, yo.  Apparently, he's doing Hits 1 right now.  He's right down the hall. 
[00:04:30]  I mean, he's not doing it live, so don't change the channel.  It's taped.  It's not live.  Where is it?  Straight down the hall to the right.  Wow.  I'm fucking...  Get him on after O&A.  Get him in here.  You're a four-eyed kid?  Yeah.  The Jennifer Aniston video?  Yeah, yeah.  I know this shit.  He just did a Britney Spears video.  He did one with 50.  But is he funny?  I don't...  Has he ever talked?  No, he just thinks things.  He called my show a couple times.  Wow.  He's hilarious.  You don't know about Who Kids Celebrity Connections.  Yeah, I had to call his father.  He had to get out of school.  It was a curfew.  I listen to Who Kid when he has you on. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, man.  See?  You should have me on more.  I should not, but I should listen when you're not on.  I should listen when you're not on.  He's got Mike Tyson in his phone book.  Because he offers you girls the entire time you're there, and you're like,  Morning, guys.  This guy don't like black girls, man.  I don't know what's wrong with this guy.  He's a mulatto.  I'm engaged, Who Kid.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  I'm trying to book you as a wedding DJ right now.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It doesn't matter.  I like black girls.  I can talk about, like, when I was doing radio in Buffalo, I liked black girls so much,  I started, like, hanging out in black houses. 
[00:05:30]  Get out of here.  And I got nothing.  I can't even imagine.  You serious?  I got nothing.  So we got to give him a pair of trotters.  Not hanging, man.  Yeah, we got to give him some Osamas.  Not hanging, but when I felt it, I went.  What?  They laughed at me.  That's hot, yo.  They laughed.  I once, you know, diddled one.  That's what I do now with my wife.  Diddle?  I diddled one once.  You got to have a strong finger in the relationship.  That was that sort of it, literally.  That was the first one with a black girl.  A little diddle.  What?  Yeah, but I don't think black girls are used to people saying diddle.  I don't know, man.  Like, is that what black guys say diddle? 
[00:06:00]  I finger popped her.  I poked her.  I don't know.  I poked her.  But she has, like, horrible, like, you know, feeders, yeah.  Breasts.  I like more Mesopotamian girls.  I don't know.  I'm not really into the, you know, the black chicks.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Mesopotamia.  That's the new shit right there.  Yeah.  This guy is so drunk, man.  He's down the hall.  This guy, man.  You serious?  He's in the glass studio down the hall.  What is he going to do for your show?  Late.  I'm going to have him lip sync.  And why don't we get him? 
[00:06:30]  I got this.  I know what you can do.  You're going to have him lip sync on the radio?  Yeah.  First time ever.  That's fucking brilliant.  This is why Who Kid is brilliant.  Because Who Kid knows, whatever.  If it's on the radio, whatever.  He's got his camera guy in here.  He's got his website, Radio Planet.  Of course.  Why don't we beat him to it and have the kid lip sync right now for our show?  Let's get him in here.  He's in here right now, idiot.  There he is.  Put on a song, Iraq.  Put on a song for him to lip sync.  Put on I Got a Feeling.  He loves a black eyed piece.  Yeah.  So, we're going to beat him. 
[00:07:00]  We're going to beat Move Kid.  Welcome to the show.  What's his name?  I don't want to...  Kenan Cahill.  Yeah, Kenan.  Welcome to the show, you short little fucked up lip sync friend.  Oh, wow.  You four eyed monster.  Iraq, you ready for the song?  Because Kenan Cahill is in here.  This guy's nuts, man.  I give up, man.  He's going to lip sync for us right now.  You should...  By the way...  Iraq's like, I really got to play along with this shit.  Since Nicole...  Remember when Nicole from the morning mashup barged in here?  To announce that she was engaged?  Like, in the middle of our show? 
[00:07:30]  Right.  You need to barge in on their interview and be like,  Kenan Cahill!  Where is he?  He's right down that hallway.  I don't know where you...  Go all the way to the end, the first door.  If you go out this door, you make a right and go down the hallway.  Just go right in.  Can I throw a flip in his face?  Of course.  Mars will go with you to protect you from Stanley T.  He's a mad cool guy.  Kenan, right?  Yep, Kenan Cahill.  Kenan Cahill.  All right.  You don't actually have to play the song anymore.  You know, one of the videos I did with Who Kid is one of my biggest videos.  On my YouTube channel still?  He knows that.  Well, I love that.  You can get called out on it. 
[00:08:00]  I love it, yeah.  That Mariah Carey pissed on you.  I mean, Nick Kenan wants me to be buried in boiling lava, but...  This is...  Mariah Carey is the mother of twins now, Opie.  You're bringing up her getting pissed on by Eminem.  And I'm friends.  No, she has a real baby show.  And I'm now friends with Nick Cannon because he gave me a shout-out on his Twitter.  That's all it takes.  Oh, for real?  Yeah, that turns me around.  You've just shouted me out on fucking Twitter.  I'm your friend.  Fuck it.  Can I shout you out on Twitter?  No, I don't follow you.  Oh, shit.  Give up, man. 
[00:08:30]  That's not cool.  Is Kenny still waiting, you think?  Yeah, he better be.  It's his job.  Kenny's going to kill me.  Are you going to go see Keenan Cahill?  You have a shiny object that I can distract Kenny when I get down there?  Just jingle your keys in front of him.  Yeah.  Oh, keys.  What are you going to talk to Keenan Cahill about?  We're just going to have him lip sync like 30 records.  And I'm going to put the album out, the first lip sync album.  This is brilliant.  He really is brilliant.  The Keenan Cahill mixtape.  You're really going to have him lip sync on your radio show today.  Lip sync.  The whole, like, 30 joints. 
[00:09:00]  New exclusives, too.  I thought we did shitty right now.  That's just fucking brilliant, man.  I'm stealing that one.  And let me tell you, this is what's going to make it even better.  While he's lip syncing, Who Kid is going to dance on the radio.  So it'll be like the whole thing.  That'll be kind of hot.  It'll be crazy.  I'll be on some Diddy stuff.  Exactly.  Moving the shoulders around.  When do I get to do your show?  You can come on my show any damn time.  I don't know when you're on.  You have to come in here on a Saturday all day.  He does a nine-hour radio show. 
[00:09:30]  10 a.m. to, like, 8 p.m.  On Shade, right?  Yeah.  He's the only black guy who gets up at 10 a.m. to do a radio show.  Don't disrespect me right now.  I'm sorry about that.  I can't do it this weekend.  Try to be on radio forever, man.  I can't do it this weekend, but I'm going to do it soon.  Do I have to stay for the whole fucking thing?  Nah, man.  I'll make sure that some black chicks, I'll bring some black strippers.  You're going to want to.  Somebody did that.  We'll stop by.  It might be a little smelly in there.  I didn't want to say that, but when I finger popped her, what's that about?  It might be a little smelly in there, I'll tell you.  Why?  Maybe I should have you finger pop a real artist. 
[00:10:00]  Nah.  Like who?  Olivia?  Why the smell?  Because usually the moisture is different in different women.  Booty, yeah.  This is who can...  This is from a real doctor.  This Indian doctor I know, he told me that they smell differently.  Yeah, but if a white guy says that, I would get fired.  For real?  But you're saying that you've got proof that women smell differently.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been with almost everything.  The Mesopotamian one.  Who smells the best, according to this doctor? 
[00:10:30]  I think...  Not Greek.  Your boss is in here, is out there laughing at you.  Who, kid?  Reef.  Of course you've got a white boss.  That's not fair.  Yeah, that's the guy in charge of Shave 45.  The guy in charge of Shave 45 is white?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Reef.  I never know him.  I mean, listen.  Is he good?  The guy who Shave 45 is named after is white.  Eminem.  Good point.  He has a receding hairline, but he's a cool guy.  I mean, you know who the big boss of Shave 45 is?  The same guy who's the big boss of our channel. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  The big...  Not, you know...  Who?  Steve Blatter.  I don't know.  That guy.  What do you mean?  He's a great guy.  Who is he?  Have you seen him?  Yeah.  I've hung out with him.  What does he look like?  He went to a strip club and everything.  You went to a strip club with Steve Blatter?  Crazy.  That's incredible.  He came out with an ill...  He had a suede front.  What?  I don't even know people still wear those, yo.  He just apart for the strip club?  What?  Yo, he was going in.  That is a surprise to me.  Steve Blatter was going in, yo.  I was like, wow.  Where's this freak? 
[00:11:30]  You just got yourself in trouble.  I give up with this guy, man.  Every time you come in this studio...  You guys are going to be traumatizing that little kid, man.  You're going to hear this for eight hours if I didn't get help.  Every time you come in here, you get in trouble.  First, Nick Cannon hates you.  Now, Steve Blatter's not going to be happy with you, Who Kid?  I don't know any of this is true.  Do you want to make another video?  Yeah, let's do so.  You got any dirt?  Well, Opie, you just made another video.  You think Who Kid gets releases for Radio Planet?  No, you just made Radio Planet.  No, but we can do this together.  In cooperation.  Of course, the black guy is the bigger fucking camera. 
[00:12:00]  I should tell you why artists gave me a sexual disease.  Yeah, that would be great.  Wait, what?  We got DJ Who Kid in here from G-Unit, from Radio Planet, Shade 45.  DJ Who Kid, you were just telling us that some celebrity artist gave you a sexually transmitted infection.  Yeah, on my earlobe.  On your earlobe?  On your earlobe.  Yeah, she was licking my earlobe.  She gave you ear herpes?  It was like a good 16 years ago.  Who was it?  Wait, you got herpes on your earlobe?  Not really herpes, but it was a rare form of, I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  Like a rash.  Kind of like a, I don't know.  Yeast infection?  Like crab, like little baby crabs.  Little insects.  Wait, you had like fucking critters on your earlobe?  Yeah, it was weird.  Around behind your ear too?  No, it was on the earlobe.  You got it from her tongue?  Yeah, because when she was licking the earring hole, the moisture from her mouth portal went  in there and then all of a sudden the humidity combined with the condensation. 
[00:13:00]  So tell me who was this celebrity?  It was, well, she wasn't Nas's wife at that time, but Khalees, Khalees, the one who brings  her milkshake to the yard.  Oh, she put some milkshake in my earlobe.  Really?  Khalees, before she met Nas.  Yeah, that was way before Nas.  You said it was like 16 years ago.  Yeah, that was like...  The worst of After ONA Live.  Rob Cross is circling like a shark out there.  He's going to try to talk to you, Opie.  And so is Gabby.  Hey! 
[00:13:30]  Nicole, bring Nicole in here.  Get Nicole in here.  Nicole, come in here.  Come in here.  Come in here.  Come in here.  It's soundproof, but they can see you.  Come in here.  Come in here.  You talk to Kenan?  This is a serious party.  Where's Kenan?  He's the cutest kid ever.  He's in the other studio.  Look at how cute he is.  Did you get him...  It's like a party in here.  I want to eat him up.  Serious fusion.  You got Shade 45.  Hips 1.  The virus.  Crush promotion.  Who doesn't like it?  Let me go meet him.  It's like an orgy in here.  This is the best.  It's like a satellite orgy going on. 
[00:14:00]  Except one girl in this orgy.  What's up with that?  Who's kidding?  I can handle it.  Yeah, it's sound like gangbang.  You see all these black guys in here?  Exactly.  I can handle it.  You're the only black guy.  What are you talking about?  Let me go live on radio right now.  What's wrong with this guy?  Let me just go before the black guys, please.  Okay.  Okay.  Nicole, I know you had some party days, but I didn't know you could handle all this.  Well, you know.  You don't know everything about me.  You didn't see the camera guy either.  He's in on this.  He's in on this.  What's up? 
[00:14:30]  It's awesome.  So did you get him to lip sync?  You know what he lip synced to?  To the Stanley T's sack song.  He sang about Stanley T's Big Black Sack.  Do you guys, first of all.  Big Black Sack.  That's not hits one friendly, is it?  It is.  You didn't hear this song?  Big Black Sack.  You didn't hear this song?  Pause, man.  What's going on right now?  I don't know.  We're going to talk to Kenan about this.  How old is this shit?  And how does his lip syncing sound on the air?  Well, we have a video of it that we're going to put up at our site.  Wise guy.  Everybody.  Everybody's stealing these ideas. 
[00:15:00]  What's up with all this lip syncing shit?  I don't know.  Everybody wants to lip sync on the radio.  God, I didn't know we could lip sync on the radio.  Our show's going to be a lot easier tomorrow.  Who Kid is doing a mix tape of lip syncing?  30 records exclusives live on air.  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.  Live on air.  Right.  Live on air.  Did you know who Kid got an STD on his ear from Khalees?  Is that a joke?  Opie.  Yeah, it's a very rare.  Opie's piece it out.  It's very rare.  Opie's trying to sneak out, by the way.  Oh, what the heck?  You're leaving me hanging?  You're leaving me with all these black dudes and sand? 
[00:15:30]  He goes, oh.  Yes, I'm out of here.  That's it.  While I still have my wallet intact.  Oh, no.  That's wrong.  I know.  It wasn't me.  I want to have an alibi.  Wait.  So did you really get...  Is this a joke?  Or did you really get a STD on your ear?  It was very traumatic.  But I'm still...  Opie is leaving alibi intact.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Play it.  How the fuck did you do that?  I used to wear, like, big earrings back then.  So she used to, like, lick my earrings.  Wait.  So you were doing it with Khalees? 
[00:16:00]  Uh, nah.  Well, she was licking your ear.  She just licked your ears and nowhere else?  It was, like, 15 years ago.  Uh-oh.  Just saying.  Gary and Rob Cross, two bosses trying to talk to Opie.  Opie does not like being talked to by bosses.  What do you think that he's saying to them right now?  Opie.  Opie.  You lip sync to Opie.  Let me see.  Let me lip read a little bit.  Okay, I think he's going to put his hand up and say, not on the air, not talking.  And then he walks as quick as he can.  Mars.  You know Opie.  Do you think I'm right about this?  Absolutely.  E-Rock?  Oh, yeah.  He's saying, who are you? 
[00:16:30]  Who are you?  I'm not acknowledging you if I'm not on the air.  And Roland's trying to pitch him guests down there.  Kenny is still waiting, by the way.  Opie ended the show at about 9.50.  Kenny's been waiting for 40 minutes downstairs for Opie.  He's, like, running from them.  Do you know what he said while we were on commercial break?  Sam, I can't do your show today.  My back hurts.  I said, we'll see.  And then I trap him in here until the commercial breaks over.  Come on back in here, Opie.  Let's wave him back in.  Let's see if we can get him back in.  No, look.  He's trapped between management.  He's trapped between management.  That's what I'm saying.  We're the lesser of the evils. 
[00:17:00]  He'll come back in if management won't let him out.  Can they hear you?  Can they hear you?  I don't know.  Come back in.  Oh, he's flipping me off.  Oh, come on.  He can get the finger in the middle.  Who is he pointing at?  He's pointing at you.  Oh, me.  Just me.  Just me.  That's real nice, Opie.  That's real nice.  Which white people got nice hair, yo?  How come he doesn't have a hairline problem?  Well, you know about what Anthony did?  He did have a hairline problem at one point.  Oh, okay.  But then he went and had the procedure done where they take the hair out from the back of your head. 
[00:17:30]  And put it, yeah.  And then they implanted the follicles individually back into your hairline.  I thought they took that off your ass.  No, no, no.  It's no ass hair on Anthony.  It's from his harvest area.  Wow.  In the back.  That's what I was going to say.  The harvest area.  The neck cheese.  And then they implant it into the top hair.  It's not pubic hair?  I don't think it's pubic hair.  Oh, okay.  I don't think so.  It would save you money on a perm.  It would be a little curly up there.  Is that what was happening?  I mean, it's painful.  I'm just saying.  It takes many hours. 
[00:18:00]  Extra curly up there.  Listen, when are you supposed to interview Keenan?  They're done with him.  Yeah, he already did, I thought.  Well, he's going to come Saturday.  Oh, he's coming back on Saturday.  To do everything live.  Who kids got the connection.  You see, who kids got it live, you guys are taping your interviews.  That's an effort.  I used to have him call like every two, three months at a time.  And he's like three weeks.  No, he was shocking that he was that short.  I thought he was going to be a little bigger, but he's cute and small.  Stan, you can feel free to kick Mars off that mic.  He's doing nothing over there.  There's one right here. 
[00:18:30]  Love you guys.  No, Ant doesn't like black guys on his mic.  Damn.  Ryan, you can grab it.  Is that a joke?  That's the racist mic.  Well, I mean, Obi brought it up.  Obi didn't want Who Kid to take the mic.  So I'm not trying to get you in trouble.  That's the racist mic.  To get me in trouble.  I don't like that.  Really?  Look, I mean, it is what it is.  It's not my rules.  I got the white mouth.  I don't know.  For real?  He's really like that?  I mean, we'd have to ask him.  But Obi said it.  Obi, his name is on the wall.  Yeah.  I'm not nervous.  I'm never nervous.  You never see me nervous.  But Obi's name is on the wall.  Obi didn't let Who Kid on the mic. 
[00:19:00]  Who am I?  So, you know, Who Kid, Sam and I have talked about this behind the scenes before.  But you know we're both getting married next year.  Oh, wow.  That's hot.  Not to each other.  No.  Yeah, no.  Not to each other.  I want to get married, too.  But we thought, you know, he was like, maybe it would be cool if I tried to get Who Kid to come.  I told him.  And I was like, maybe I want to ask him.  What the fuck?  Right.  And then we started getting this fight.  Who Kid, first of all, nobody's going to.  Look.  Nobody's going to Nicole's wedding.  Is that what you were going to say?  You like. 
[00:19:30]  Who Kid likes me a lot because of the Opie and Anthony connection.  Okay.  I got this platform.  But he likes me a lot because of this connection.  You're not going to fuck him at your wedding.  I definitely do.  But you're not going to put out for him to be your DJ.  But if Opie goes to my wedding and Who Kid is DJing, look at that little thing right there.  Who Kid's all about the connections.  Okay.  You know what?  I got to play all this.  He wants me to play Hall of Notes.  Exactly.  We're trying to get some white people to use it.  A lot of slime Bonita and stuff like that.  Reef is looking at you like, what the fuck is he doing in there? 
[00:20:00]  Oh, you think he's mad at you?  He's been in there for a half hour.  What is he doing?  Nah, he wants me to give him that hairline receding oil.  But I told him he's in a desk.  What?  What's wrong with this guy?  Well, listen.  He's not happy.  He's giving you the eye.  Now you're getting flipped off.  I'm getting a little figured out.  Listen, at some point, we should probably play an Opie and Anthony thing.  All right.  Let's do it.  Oh, we got to take a break here?  Yeah, we're behind on brace.  Okay.  We got to take a break.  This is a real show today. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, is it?  Who's coming in?  Opie's back!  Yay!  Opie's back!  Oh, don't touch that mic.  Oh, you're white.  He's white.  I'm white.  He's white.  Okay, go ahead.  Wait, did you touch Anthony's mic?  No, I didn't touch his own fucking mic, man.  We agreed that we don't want to touch that motherfucking mic either.  That's what we just said.  I can't believe this guy.  I can't believe this guy.  That's my only job.  I don't know.  It's my only job.  If there's proof that a black guy talked on Ant's mic, I'm in hell tomorrow.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think he could tell? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ant would.  I'm not saying there is.  I'm not saying that's legitimate.  I ain't eat no chicken yet, but I can't possibly tell.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Mars, I mean, you know, as a man of ethnicity.  What?  You know that if you were on Anthony's mic, he would have a problem with that.  Well, I lie so late.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I can't put no nigga spit on it.  Oh, my God.  I could say nigga, right?  You could say it.  You could.  You could.  Yeah.  I can't.  How is this connected to the Opie and Anthony show at this point, sir? 
[00:21:30]  Guess what?  It's not.  I told you.  I was taking this thing over.  I just booked that little freak on our show.  Oh.  Don't call him after his face, though, right?  No, I wouldn't.  You mean on this show or on your show?  I would never do that.  Keenan.  Keenan what?  Yeah.  Cahill.  Cahill.  Yeah, Cahill.  Cahill.  Keenan and Rich got him right now.  You mean on this show or on your show?  This show.  Yeah.  Sam Roberts interviews.  Sam's always pushing his agenda.  It's all about Sam Roberts.  It is all about Sam Roberts.  I just want y'all to know that.  I've never made a secret about that. 
[00:22:00]  I love you.  I mean, Opie, you brought this up on the air and said, you're hijacking the show.  And I said, you gave it to me.  I can't hijack it.  And you said...  We didn't give you this.  You said, well, then how'd I get it?  I don't know how you got this.  It's pretty brilliant on your part.  You said you're supposed to be playing Opie and Anthony bits.  And I acknowledge...  You probably should.  I started strong with the ONA bits.  What more are you going to play today?  Well, we got the Carol Miller tapes.  Because that was brought up.  See, you're saying...  He doesn't like that one.  He doesn't like that one.  Next.  Next, Sam.  It's old school stuff. 
[00:22:30]  Pick it, pick it, man.  We were going to play in honor of Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  It's Fieri.  Get it right, dude.  What is it?  Fieri.  It's not Fieri at all.  Yeah.  There's a T in there?  No, it's that T for now.  But there's ours.  I said Fieri.  Listen, that's how you pronounce it.  This is Sam Roberts' interviews.  We got E-Rock's Broken Fridge.  Aww.  Now, is that a good bit?  Yeah, but what if the kid comes in?  Well, I'm not going to play it.  I'm saying this is what I would have played.  Oh, oh, oh.  What are we going to do until this thing shows up? 
[00:23:00]  Well, we got it.  A human being, Opie.  Come on.  Well, Opie called him a waterhead earlier.  One minute?  One minute?  One minute.  No, Roland's making jack-off noises.  Do I have time to break?  Because E-Rock is insisting we take a break.  Yeah, all right.  I guess I go home then.  Roland is pointing at E-Rock and saying he's eating.  Oh, really?  I think you're fabulous, E-Rock.  You guys are really out of control, man.  I don't know what's going on anymore, man.  Hey, just out of curiosity, what channel are y'all on tomorrow?  We haven't figured that out yet. 
[00:23:30]  We don't know.  I think it's 204 and 69.  We're still on separate channels.  Okay.  106 and 208.  We're Hits 1 on Channel 2.  By the way, you want some Hits 1 news?  What's that?  Guess who's filling in for Kid Kelly today?  Oh, Sam Roberts.  That's impressive.  I defended you guys, by the way.  You did.  Hits 1 on Channel 2.  How does that make sense?  It does, man.  Well, it makes about as much sense as 20 on 20 on Channel 3.  You know, it's number 3.  We're doing Channel Change Humor now. 
[00:24:00]  This is wonderful, Sam.  I believe you have any control of this room right now.  I absolutely do.  Channel Change fucking Humor.  We're going to go to who, kid?  Who, kid?  I heard we're going to be 69.  Yeah, what channel is Shade 45 going to be?  I think it's 69.  Come on.  So it's going to be Shade.  Wait, Shade 45 is changing to...  I mean, they almost gave it to 66, but come on.  We don't ever limit the devil.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that a joke?  Who, kid, lies a lot.  I never know when he's...  Nah, I'm lying.  I'm lying. 
[00:24:30]  When he doesn't know the answer to something, he makes it up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then says he's not lying.  Are you supposed to take a break?  Yeah, I am.  But if I take a break, Obi's leaving.  So I'm trying to stretch this thing.  I'll keep going.  Unless the little thing...  He's a person.  He's a king.  How old is he, 16?  Oh, he's 16.  That's a tiny little 16.  I thought he was 32.  Shade 45 is still going to be on Channel 45.  That's fabulous.  I just checked.  I thought he had a Gary Coleman thing happening.  Oh, Shade 45 is 30 plus?  I think he does have something like that.  All right, well...  Stop talking about the channel changes.  An early death.  Oh, good. 
[00:25:00]  I'm like I don't have it.  E-Rock, it's just a single, right?  No.  No, I'm not doubling.  You have to.  Or what?  We have four breaks left.  All right, so maybe we'll quadruple before the best-around of fans.  Okay, then you have...  Yeah, Ronnie's not here to pitch about it.  You have five minutes, then.  All right, we'll do that instead.  Well, where's the guy?  Are they going to be mad if I play four breaks in a row?  Sure, sure.  Do what you want.  All right, I'm going to do that, then.  Should I lip-sync the breaks?  Yeah, you lip-sync during the commercials.  We'll do that, then.  Yeah, I mean, if they complain about the number of breaks, I just blame Opie and Anthony, 
[00:25:30]  because four breaks in any hour is a lot.  So I just say Opie and Anthony should have taken more breaks.  Is he coming in right now?  Opie's terrible.  I think the guy with the tiny kidneys are coming in.  He's coming in right now.  Is he coming in?  Yes!  What?  Exclusive!  What?  I have him do the Friday song.  Does he know the Friday song?  It doesn't matter.  He's lip-syncing.  He doesn't know the Friday song.  It doesn't matter, because he just goes...  He makes the same movements, no matter what song it is.  Why don't you give some of our breaks to...  What's the hottest song on it?  Oh, Ron and Fez.  Judas! 
[00:26:00]  Judas!  Judas!  I would say Blow.  Blow!  Kesha.  Where are you going, Nicole?  Katie Perry.  Where do you have to go?  I have worked at the 411 to attend to.  You're doing work.  You're on the air.  When are you getting married?  I'm getting married next June.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  You're away.  Oh, we got Jay Curtis feedbacking in from a truck that says,  Shut up, Nick Hole.  Which I don't...  Why don't you shut up, you piece of...  Good one.  You can say shit if you want.  You piece of shit.  I noticed Stanley T. dropped the MF.  Later. 
[00:26:30]  You're leaving too?  Well, you don't got to do a 411.  Much love.  I didn't want to talk to you.  They do.  They travel in a group.  They all go to breakfast together.  It's a mashup.  Where's the kid?  I'm the only nigger here now.  What about Will I'm Not?  That's Will I'm Not, man.  I like Will I'm Not.  This guy got a perm or something.  By the way, Will I'm Not tears the hell out of me.  This guy got a perm, man.  He got a military hat on.  You just dropped the word with the E-R.  You can even get away with that?  You didn't even use an A on that one.  Because in my radio show, I'm white, so I can say that. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, I got you.  Okay, that makes sense.  Notice on the tape, every time I had some racial shit to say,  I turned my back to Will I'm Not, man.  Because he scares the living shit out of me.  Somebody wrapped Covino and Rich up already.  Oh, my God.  What are they doing?  What are we going to have them do?  The Friday song?  Friday.  But we got to get them in now.  We don't have a lot of time left.  I know this Kenan kid.  What do you mean you know him?  You met him before?  No, I just know him from the internet.  He's got millions of hits.  Everybody knows him from the internet.  I feel like I know him because of the internet.  I hope he's got a thing. 
[00:27:30]  He thinks when he meets celebrities.  No, this is a real thing.  It's true.  When he meets celebrities that he's seen on TV, he thinks he knows them, and they know  him because he's watched them.  And I feel like they should know me.  And not because I have some kind of fame now.  This goes back to way before I was doing radio.  You think that's a little sad?  I don't know.  Is he coming in?  Oh, God.  Here's the little fucking twerp.  This guy, Opie, is heartless, man.  Damn, man.  Yeah, Opie, it's not right, the things you're saying. 
[00:28:00]  Do we get the booster seat?  Are we ready to go?  Y-Rock, what song do you have ready for him?  I got a bunch here.  I got Blow, I got a Feeling, Friday Judas.  We have five minutes.  Five minutes?  All right.  Can you do the Friday song?  Yeah.  Y-Rock, do we have five minutes?  Let me see.  Set up a chair for the little crowd.  Oh, we got five.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  He's coming in now.  Don't worry about it, Y-Rock.  The worst of After Opie and Anthony Live.  He's coming in now.  Right this way.  Kenan!  Right this way.  How's it going, man?  Hey, Kenan.  Yo, Kenan.  Welcome to After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:28:30]  Grab the mic.  Can you sit down, Kenan?  I'm a big fan, actually, believe it or not.  You have gone on this viral video thing and have met every celebrity wants to do a video with you.  What is it about you lip syncing that's so attractive to these people?  I have no idea.  Did you just start it randomly?  Yep.  Just randomly.  Got a computer for my 13th birthday.  You know, I had a webcam and everything.  Yeah.  You know, just the lip syncing, just put it on there, you know, on YouTube. 
[00:29:00]  Didn't think it would go anywhere.  So then all of a sudden, you know, got a little bit bigger and then Katy Perry did it.  Yeah.  You've got to be sponsored now.  You've got to be making money off these things now.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah, I do.  I think you've got this thing called swag, you know.  He's got the swag?  Yeah, he's got the swag.  He does.  He walked in here with his Beats headphones on.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, this is me.  The guy from YouTube.  The guy from YouTube.  Not a guy.  The guy from YouTube.  I feel like I'm meeting a huge star right now. 
[00:29:30]  You are.  I mean, like shaking.  I'm so used to...  Yeah, Opie is shaking.  I'm shaking a little bit.  You're a big star.  How was Jennifer Aniston?  She's really, really nice.  Yeah?  I have a thing for her, you know.  Did you, you know, make any moves?  No.  You've got to make a couple moves.  No.  Just a little move.  I'm so used to seeing you on like a screen that's like this big, like a YouTube screen.  Yeah.  Do people freak out when they meet you?  Like when they see you on the street, do people recognize you?  They look at me like, wait, is that him? 
[00:30:00]  I don't know if it is or that's not...  It couldn't be.  Of course it's you.  But it's you.  And then they were like, oh, it is.  Never mind.  I've got to go.  I've got to get out of here.  You're like one of a kind, sir.  Hey, can you do a song for us today?  Yeah, sure.  Which one?  You like Blow by Kesha?  That's a big...  Have you done it yet here?  No.  You haven't done Blow?  Yeah.  The mashup.  The mashup was sweet.  You just did the morning mashup, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they should have done it.  Why?  Is Blow a good one for him to do?  Is Blow a good one to do? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  You like it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do this because he only has a couple minutes with us.  Yeah.  We've got to hook him up with some headphones.  Opie, you've got to ditch the headphones.  Because you're not lip syncing, man.  This is not your show anymore.  Hold on.  Let me...  You're being selfish.  Opie's crazy, man.  I give up, man.  What?  You good?  All right.  So what are we doing here?  We're doing Kesha's Blow?  Yeah.  All right.  This is Keenan doing a little lip syncing, which is very strange on the radio.  I'm so glad it came up with this idea.  Exclusive right here.  Don't steal this one, hoot kid.  Taking this. 
[00:31:00]  Put this on the mixtape.  This is the ODA exclusive.  All right.  Here's Keenan doing Blow by Kesha.  Hit it, E-Rock.  He's doing a dancing.  This is great.  This is awesome.  It's just like on YouTube.  He knows the work. 
[00:31:30]  It's like he's singing.  I'm watching him, and it's like he's singing it.  I like Kesha, though.  But it's Kesha.  It's like Kesha, but more good-looking.  Yeah, yeah.  See, but the brilliance of my video, you don't hear the song in the background.  Yeah.  You just see him doing this.  Look at the expressions.  He's got the most expressive face in Hollywood.  Swag, little kid.  Swag.  Swag is the word.  He knows he's famous.  He's killing the lip-syncing game right now. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, he is.  No one is coming for him.  Look at him go.  Look at him go.  This is incredible, little kid.  I got my hands up right there.  Opie, you got a hit right here.  Yeah, lip-syncing on the radio.  Amazing.  Oh, he knew it.  He got the extra what in there.  He went, what?  This is a YouTube phenomenon.  Kenan, the kid who lip-syncs on YouTube.  You've seen him. 
[00:32:30]  He's here.  You're hearing him, kind of.  Number 27 on YouTube.  He's a man.  Listen close.  You can hear his mouth move.  Yeah, right.  You seeing this, Troy?  This shit is insane.  You got everybody coming soon.  Everybody wants to be a part of it.  Everybody wants to check out Kenan.  Look at that.  He rolled his eyes up in the back of his head.  This is phenomenal.  This is the greatest thing I've ever done on radio.  I got my hands up right now. 
[00:33:00]  Put your hands up.  This isn't Opie and Anthony.  This is after Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  This is my show.  There's ratings right here.  Look at this.  Go.  Opie's really got us right now.  He's got us.  He's got us.  Yeah.  Oh, he's breaking it down.  He's breaking it down.  I like that look, Kenan.  That was a good one.  This is huge.  And by the way, Radio Planet is bootlegging this ass. 
[00:33:30]  She has to Opie and Sleek.  Oh, this is great.  Kenan got me liking Kesha, though.  Kenan is the man.  But I hate Kesha.  Not anymore.  Not no more.  Oh, let's see if he gets the We Are Taken.  Oh, he's getting it.  Wow.  He ain't got it.  Look at him make love to the camera.  Look at those eyes.  The camera loves this kid. 
[00:34:00]  Swag.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  And his hair moved.  And his eyes in the back of his eyes.  I like how he kicked back into that.  This is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  You got to be on Opie's YouTube channel later.  Because this is the craziest thing you'll ever see.  Yo, Opie, this might be one of your big ones.  This is the big one.  This is the biggest.  The biggest one you got.  Look at him.  Look at the shoulder game.  It's better than Diddy.  Well, Opie's counting the money right now. 
[00:34:30]  He is.  Oh, wow.  Incredible.  Kenan.  Unbelievable.  Let's take it on the radio.  All right.  Now, Kenan, let me ask you this.  Very good, Kenan.  The situation shows off his abs, right?  That's his thing?  Yes.  He stopped showing them because he was afraid of overexposure and all this stuff.  Is there any fear in your heart of like, look, I got to save this lip syncing stuff for  my YouTube channel?  Like, do you think at one point you'll come in here and be like, I'm not lip syncing for 
[00:35:00]  you guys?  No.  You won't do it?  No.  Because that's your thing.  People love it.  You do it for the love of the game.  I thought you wanted to see his abs, Sam.  I mean, whatever.  I mean, this show is kind of loosey-goosey free format, so whatever.  All right.  We got to get Kenan out here.  Kenan, thank you so much.  Thank you for having me.  All right.  Liam, did you hook this up?  I did, yeah.  You're the man.  This was an amazing get, Liam.  Thank you.  Eminem's cousin right there.  Where's he going now?  I think we're going to swing by Cosmo and then he's got an event tonight.  You got an event?

It can't get any easier than that.  Times Square, two o'clock.  Be there.  Liam, I'm going to be in the lobby right after this.  I mean, now that he was on my show, I can't get away with getting a picture with him, right?  And also follow me on Twitter at KenanGale.com.  You're blowing up Twitter and YouTube?  At KenanGale, yep.  You're making Opie very jealous.  He's trying to do what you're doing, and you're just destroying him.  Kenan, I got annihilated him.  I got 85,000 followers.

Wait, for Teenage Dream?  He got 38 million on one.  On one video?  Opie just gave you his whole channel views.  That's a face to me.  My whole views all together, I think it's like 250 million.

Yeah, at least, you know, give her a little.  Katy Perry's got nice feet.  You know, enjoy yourself, Kenan.  Hey, bye, Kenan.  This kid can dress and everything.  This kid has swag.  Nah, I'm the nigger in here again.  What the hell do I do with that video?  Put that shit up today!  One without the music, one with the music.  I ain't fucking.  Watch.  I just deleted that shit.

Mars, that's a terrible.  He's got like man hands and shit.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Mars, he's got tiny kidneys and he's not going to make 30.  You want to make it obvious to everybody?  Oh, wow.  Way to be a downer.  We just tease him.  This is why you stick to the engineering.  This guy's a heartless, man.  I thought we were Christian up here, man.  Listen.  We're not Christians? </pre>
