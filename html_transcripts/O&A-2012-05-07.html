<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Anthony's email claiming he had whooping cough ("Petusis"), prompting Opie, worried about his child, to have the studio disinfected.  Debate ensued about whether Ant was joking.  The conversation then transitioned to Sam Roberts' upcoming wedding and his recent return to radio following his father's death. Opie recounted a raccoon encounter at a playground, sparking a discussion about paternal instincts and city rats.  Dr. Steve, a frequent caller, joined to discuss pertussis, clarifying its symptoms and treatment, before engaging in an unexpectedly lengthy conversation with the hosts about black holes and astrophysics. The show then shifted to the success of *The Avengers*, their interview choices (Clark Gregg, not Loki), past celebrity encounters (Scarlett Johansson, Jack Black), and the death of Adam Yauch (MCA), concluding with a playful rendition of "Fight for Your Right (to Party)."

The next segment began with recounting negative celebrity interactions (Jack Black, Luke Wilson), followed by a graphic description of Baron Davis's severe knee injury and the Knicks' playoff struggles.  A large portion focused on Jim Norton's Cleveland comedy special taping, detailing frustrating encounters with a union representative, lighting issues during the first show, and Norton's subsequent angry outburst. He also described taping an introduction with Ozzy Osbourne at Osbourne's house, including listening to unreleased Black Sabbath tracks. The segment included discussion about the special's release and promotional plans, disruptive audience members, and a brief mention of Anthony's potential illness and the studio disinfection by Bob Kelly, who joined the show.  The discussion included tangents about rats and Bob Kellyâ€™s bandolier.

The following segment started with the hosts discussing their positive experiences in Cleveland, shifting quickly to crude jokes about a Kentucky Derby murder and bestiality.  Kurt Love called in, discussing Anthony's illness and sharing anecdotes about getting sick after showing Anthony kittens, adding to the crude humor. Jim Norton detailed his frustrations with Comedy Central tapings, including audience manipulation and laugh track editing for "Monster Rain." The conversation shifted to Sam Roberts' wedding, with jokes about wedding etiquette and Sam's appearance, including a bizarre discussion of eyebrow threading and a Game of Thrones-themed dance. Further tangents covered the hosts' personal lives (family, sleep, diet), UFC fights, and Jim Norton's perceived niceness. Tyson Walter was mentioned as a friend of one of the hosts.

A near-altercation at a Bruce Springsteen concert became the focus of the next segment.  One host described a confrontation with a man who cut in line, blocking his view, and the subsequent apology.  The conversation expanded to other confrontations and hypothetical fight scenarios, interspersed with discussions of a comedy award, Springsteen's concert details, Weight Watchers, a viral video ("Angry Chip"), and reactions to videos of people performing stunts at extreme heights.  No guests were explicitly mentioned in studio during this part.

The final segment began with a continuation of the dangerous stunts discussion, including a BASE jumper and building climbers (Burj Khalifa, Taipei 101). One host announced a turbinate-shrinking procedure appointment, prompting a humorous repetition of the word "turbinates" and a game to guess the most important holiday (Mother's Day). This led to a comedic advertisement for gold-dipped roses.  The hosts discussed Instagram promotion, a Daily News cartoon about the show, and upcoming appearances (Kansas City, Riotcast.com, an NYC TV show).  A missed fly-fishing trip with Donald Trump Jr. was mentioned, followed by a discussion of one host's increased Instagram followers due to a YouTube video featuring a man with a golf ball in his head.  This led to a debate about desensitization for viral content.  The segment concluded with guest Chaz Palminteri, who discussed his new movie "A Mighty Fine," experiences at Opie's wedding, his acting career (comparing his one-man show to Rich Voss), anecdotes about Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor, and his suburban life. The show ended with a clip of Palminteri and Rich Voss acting together.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  What do we got today?  Every day it's a different group in here.  It really is a rotating staff.  I haven't seen Jimmy in a week.  Jimmy's back, ants out.  That's what we got today. 
[00:00:30]  Apparently me and Ant got a problem.  I'm feeling well.  I don't know. I don't know what's going on.  I mean, he wrote something about the whooping cough on an email yesterday.  So I had this whole place disinfected. I hope people appreciate it.  That whooping cough is some sick shit.  He doesn't really have that, right?  I don't know. That's what he wrote.  Maybe he's just joking.  Huh?  Maybe he's kidding with the whooping cough.  Well, if he's kidding, I hope he tells someone he's kidding.  What's producer? Is that what that is? 
[00:01:00]  Petusis is the whooping cough.  Oh, that's what he wrote.  Did you have to look that up?  Because I didn't know what that meant.  Fuck, I looked it up.  Of course I did.  I got a young child at home.  So I told Bladder, get this fucking place disinfected.  I don't know if he's kidding.  What is it, Petusis?  What's Petusis?  That's what Ant's saying he's got.  I think he said my cough has become Petusis, so I think he's just probably sarcastically  going, this cough stinks.  It's described as being a highly contagious bacterial disease. 
[00:01:30]  Well, maybe he picked the wrong word then.  What, Petusis means something else?  It's whooping cough.  No, I know that, but how are you using it?  And that he meant it the way it's meant to be used, but was just joking.  Like, it's almost like saying I had the sniffles, and then going, Jesus Christ, it turned into  AIDS, I'll see you Wednesday.  Like that type of thing.  Who jokes by throwing the word Petusis around?  I would in a second.  You would?  I'd probably use it wrong.  So is he joking or not?  Girl, I had a big Petusis, boo.  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  What do you mean it's highly contagious?  So does he have it or not?  Was he joking or not?  I don't know, but if it's not, it's highly contagious.  Yeah, of course it's highly contagious.  And he probably had it in here, had it when he was in here on Friday.  Right.  And whooping.  Right.  Does he have a cough?  He had a bad cough on Friday.  Yeah, the cough is bad.  And all I know is I got the place disinfected.  Good.  I hope I got it disinfected for nothing.  That would be very funny.  But all he wrote is, this cough turned into Petusis. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I think he was probably being sarcastic.  Just using a big word.  Just saying, like, you don't hate my call.  It sucks.  How about you let some people in that?  He was just joking.  Because it's hard to read jokes on text.  We all know that.  Because Petusis is actually fucking a nightmare.  And then again, I don't know if he is or not.  And you don't sound good either.  No.  No.  As of Friday.  I was editing all week.  It was very good that I was there.  I mean, I got a lot done.  We got the whole thing done in a fucking week, which is a miracle. 
[00:03:00]  Very good.  Just picking, you know.  And I had to shoot something Saturday for Leno for the Renaissance Fair.  Right.  In California.  So, Friday I started to feel, oh, fuck.  Is it in your chest?  No, it's, I don't know, actually.  But then I felt it Saturday.  Yesterday I flew and then today.  I can, I woke up this morning and I go, boy, what's going on?  I hope it's not Petusis.  Huh?  Or Petrithith.  No one else looked up Petrusis? 
[00:03:30]  No one else looked up Petrusis?  I did immediately.  Of course you look it up immediately.  I didn't think it was a joke.  I got scared.  Basically when I, you.  I never care.  Oh, you got scared.  You didn't think it was a joke either?  Yeah, because who.  It didn't come across as a joke.  I've never heard the word Petrusis before.  Right.  If I see a word, I don't know.  Believe it or not, I look it up.  Yeah, I looked it up immediately.  So I'm like, all right, Petrusis, what the fuck is this?  And, you know.  As soon as it said.  Other name, whooping cough.  I'm like, what?  Highly contagious.  Highly contagious.  Bacterial disease.  Which is like six weeks of hell. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And people die from it.  So I'm like, okay, disinfect the whole fucking place.  I hope he doesn't have that.  And I got this, like I said, that they had to scrub this place from top to bottom for no reason.  That would be great.  That would make me very happy.  I'm just worried about not being.  But no one else wrote him back and said, are you kidding?  Did anyone write him back?  Was anyone else concerned when they looked this word up?  I guess I was concerned, but didn't think to write him back.  I was just like, oh, no.  I guess I didn't even consider that it might be a joke. 
[00:04:30]  I figured he had Petrusis.  Yeah.  I just figured he had a cough and I didn't know what Petrusis was.  Well, if you were in here Friday, the cough was weird.  So that's why weird cough and then he throws Petrusis at us.  I don't know.  Oh, I didn't know Friday he had a cough.  You're the first one saying that he was joking.  But no, if you guys heard him Friday and it was bad then, then maybe you guys are right.  It says symptoms are initially mild and then develop into severe coughing fits.  And I feel like he was starting to have coughing fits on Friday.  Oh, my God. 
[00:05:00]  I'm trying not to have Petrusis when I get married, you know?  Yeah, you don't want to have Petrusis.  Oh, I'd love you to have Petrusis.  You don't want to have Petrusis in front of your father who's marrying you.  Right.  God, you're like Little House on the Prairie.  Wait, when did you?  Did you know that his father's marrying him?  Ew, no.  It's like saving money doing that?  You can't get it.  It was Jess's idea.  Honestly, I guess it's cool, but it's weird.  I don't know.  He's the priest.  Well, yeah, he married our... 
[00:05:30]  Sam has a very close traditional family.  They're very traditional.  He married our family friends, and Jess saw him do that once, and then she had the idea  to ask him to marry us, and I said, all right.  So that was nice on her part.  So that wasn't your idea?  It was kind of hers?  It was definitely hers.  I agreed to it.  I didn't even think of it, though.  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  When is the wedding?  It's right at the beginning of next month.  It's like a month away.  You know, my dad couldn't marry us.  Why is that?  He was dead.  Oh.  Sorry to hear that.  So he doesn't even know I'm married, which sucks. 
[00:06:00]  He might know somewhere.  Well, that's what a lot of relatives like to tell me.  Do you think he was looking down?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  No.  I don't know.  He's just in the ground.  Yeah, they never do.  They never know.  They're never happy for us.  Somewhere their little boxes or power switches have been turned off.  You know, somewhere your dad is smiling down upon you and what you've become.  Really?  All right.  Yeah, he's not.  No, he's just in the ground.  The last memory he has of me was me pretty much having a nervous breakdown. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, jeez.  All right.  Because I had no fucking, I had no life literally across the board.  No career, no personal life, no friends.  He has no idea things took such an upswing.  No, he has no idea I turned the whole fucking thing around.  Huh.  No clue whatsoever.  Well, he had a clue that I was coming back to radio.  Yeah, that's true.  I signed and he died a week later.  After being with me for the two years, three months of hell, not being in work. 
[00:07:00]  He had to deal with all that and then he couldn't enjoy the...  No, I showed him the pictures from the press conference and he was dead a week later.  Oh, jeez.  How hilarious is that?  It's a riot, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And then you had to come back and perform after two years.  Yeah, without Pops.  Right.  Who was my biggest fan.  It's all good.  It happens to all of us.  We all have struggles in our lives.  Now, E-Rock is your biggest fan.  E-Rock?  No, I don't think so.  No?  No, I don't think E-Rock's my biggest fan anymore. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, I don't know.  How could he not be?  I think I'm turning that around a little bit.  E-Rock, I'm turning that around a little bit, right?  I went from your biggest fan to you fucking hating my guts and now I think we're starting  to get good again, right?  I got everything signed that I needed.  I'm good.  I don't even know what that...  What did you need signed?  It's like a joke.  Huh?  You guys always say that I'm getting shirts and stickers on time from them.  I got everything I needed.  I'm good.  All right.  Were you worried about the pertussis?  I looked it up, too.  Everyone looked it up.  So what?  And my wife goes, you know that's not good, right? 
[00:08:00]  I said, oh, he's just got a nagging cough.  She goes, no, that's really bad.  It's a highly contagious bacterial disease.  So the question remains, is he fucking with everybody, which would be hilarious, I'll be  honest with you.  Or does he really have what's commonly referred to as the whooping cough, a disease that killed  people in the 1800s?  1800s.  I feel like he would have to research diseases before he could make the joke.  Who knows what pertussis is?  Anthony would know what pertussis is.  I guess you're right.  He always knows a little bit about everything. 
[00:08:30]  So I've never heard the word pertussis until yesterday when I read the email.  Me neither.  But no one questioned it and said maybe we should fucking make sure he's just joking.  I thought he was being serious.  See, I wasn't here Friday, though, so I didn't hear him coughing.  I may not have thought he was joking if I heard him coughing.  Oh, sorry.  People are saying it's pertussis, not pertussis.  Pertussis sounds better, though.  Yeah, I think pertussis sounds more like a bacterial disease.  Plus it helped Chip get his joke out of it.  I think that was the important thing.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  That's what we were gunning for.  Yeah.  Doesn't it look more like pertussis than pertussis?  How do you spell it?  P-E-R-T-U-S-I-S?  U-S-S-I-S.  Oh, yeah.  I misread it, too.  Yeah, the extra S makes it tussis, right?  Silent.  Pertussis.  Softer.  I like pertussis.  Pertussis.  Uh, I hope he's most likely vaccinated because of recently having a baby.  Did my baby get the whooping cough fucking needle?  He got enough fucking needles.  Yeah, I mean, it says that, uh, prevention is primarily through vaccination. 
[00:09:30]  Well, I didn't get vaccinated.  How, how, how do I, how am I all right if my kid got the shot?  Maybe you were vaccinated when you were a kid.  Um, then why wasn't it?  Maybe he was, and he was just joking.  Oh, so this whole thing's a joke?  I'm drinking emergency just in case vitamin C helps prevent pertussis.  Pertussis.  You know you're going to be sick for your wedding, right?  Yeah, I know.  That's what ends up happening to everybody.  Girls, like, girls, like, uh, wait their entire lives to get married. 
[00:10:00]  It's their big day, and then they have the flu, or it's a horrible rainstorm.  That's what they look forward to.  Are you nervous?  No, not about the wedding itself.  What are you nervous about?  He doesn't get nervous about anything.  He's, he's, he's missing something.  Are you, wait, are you, but are you nervous about, you know, the big night?  No, I'm not nervous about that either.  Aside from being sick, I'm not nervous about anything.  Now, are you going to be able to not wear condoms after you get married?  I would hope so.  I would think so.  You still wearing them?  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, people are freaked out.  That sickness gets in your clothes and transmits easily.  Oh, no.  Do you think I got it from the girls in his hot tub over the weekend?  Did you see that picture?  I did.  He was partying.  He didn't have pertussis over the weekend, I guess.  Now he has pertussis, though.  He didn't tell the ladies.  Oh, he did.  He probably just coughed and dumped loads.  Yeah, good for him.  You can always blow a load even if you're coughing.  Just don't tell the chicks in the hot tub and you're good to go. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, it's called whooping cough.  The W is silent.  I don't fucking need to know this shit.  Everyone says whooping cough.  Everyone, thank you.  You pronounce the W.  It's right there for you to pronounce.  You don't need the W unless it's going to be pronounced.  I don't believe in the silent ladies.  Wow, how young are those girls?  What the fuck?  I don't acknowledge them.  Let me see.  Are you serious?  Oh, in the 20s.  I know the one chick.  She's probably 24, 25.  Yeah.  Well, that's the one.  They're old.  Huh?  They're not old, but they're all in their 20s, I'm sure. 
[00:11:30]  No fucking way.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  I wonder how many of them have pertussis.  Pertussis.  I still like pertussis.  All right.  Well, can we find out if he was joking or not?  Please.  That would be nice.  I immediately thought that he was taking, like, it's like, oh, my headache is bad.  And you call back the next day.  How you doing?  Oh, good.  It's a tumor.  I'll see you guys in the morning.  But that's how I read that?  Well, you're the only one that read it properly, then. 
[00:12:00]  No, or the only one who read it wrong.  I might be the only one who read it wrong.  Well, you probably read it properly, but I was a little paranoid.  If I was here Friday, I might not have been.  Yeah, I'm a little more paranoid because I'm a fan.  I don't give a fuck what happens to me.  I just want to make sure my kid's cool.  You don't want to bring in and share pertussis with your lovely family.  Hell no.  If anything, he's going to get you sick.  Kids always get adults sick.  Adults don't get kids sick.  You know, since I had a kid, I haven't been sick.  How's that?  Because your immune system is probably...  That's crazy.  I used to get sick all the time.  What happened?  You're probably picking up all these germs from him. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Because they fucking touch everything.  Yeah.  And they put their fingers in their mouth.  Well, he likes eating sand.  He's good that way.  You see my raccoon picture?  No.  I was fucking battling off raccoons at the park the other day.  You didn't see this?  I did not, no.  It's on my Instagram, OP Radio, but that was a cheap plug.  I apologize.  I'm going to acknowledge cheap plugs now.  Look at this picture.  Oh, there it is.  That was in between me and the swings that I wanted to use with my son. 
[00:13:00]  What time of day was that?  I don't know.  Like five.  That's not good.  That's what they say.  That's really bad.  That's what they say.  Could you have...  It didn't help.  I got bit, too, but I seem to be all right.  But what did he do?  Did he...  I was on the swings, actually.  I go to all the...  I go to three or four playgrounds.  Do you want to hear this?  What would you do?  Let me ask you.  Let me ask you a question.  I think I know the answer.  Yes.  But the way the picture is, you got the raccoon looking right out for a garbage can, and you 
[00:13:30]  have a tree.  Now, if your kid was just standing right by that tree, not realizing he was in danger,  your instinct really would be to run over and get in between.  This is what you learn.  This is what...  And I hate that I learned this.  Because you learn, when you become a father, that you'll absolutely sacrifice your own  life for your kid.  It's not even a thought.  Like, if, God forbid, he walked into traffic, I wouldn't even think twice.  Right.  You just run out.  And I hate the feeling that I now know that. 
[00:14:00]  I hate knowing that, holy fuck, I will now sacrifice my life for my kid.  Right.  Abso-fucking-lily.  If that raccoon came anywhere near him, I'm tackling the fucking thing and wrestling  with the raccoon.  It's not even a thought.  It's not even like, should I?  You just know you would.  Right.  It's hard to explain.  And I didn't have that feeling, obviously, with my nephews or nieces or other people.  But as soon as you become a father, it's not even a question.  And it bums me out, because I'm like, please don't get into some stupid situation. 
[00:14:30]  Because you don't have to sacrifice your own life.  Yeah, I just know.  But what was creepy, it was going in and out of the garbage pails.  And, you know, I walk up to those garbage pails all the time to throw something away.  Imagine, you fucking see one of these things in the bottom of the garbage pail.  Oh, God.  Huh?  Especially, like, that raccoon's crazy.  He would have bitten you.  If you go up to that garbage can, I'll jump out of the garbage can and attack.  Yeah, I hit the city playgrounds late on Saturday, so there weren't a lot of people at that playground,  which was nice, because I don't like dealing with other fathers. 
[00:15:00]  Some of the moms are good to look at, so I don't mind that.  But the fathers, I hate.  And we had the place to ourselves, and all of a sudden that thing came out of the tree  and started wandering around.  I'm like, holy fuck.  He is messy.  He was big, too.  That was a big raccoon.  And it had the run of the place, man.  I was watching some show where they were talking about raccoons  and how they were attacking, like, the family pets under the porch.  Really?  Yeah, there's just nothing you can do.  Your pet is finished.  Of course.  How much do they weigh, raccoons? 
[00:15:30]  30 pounds?  15 pounds?  I'm sure a pit bull would be, except for the rabies angle,  but I'm sure pit bulls can handle them.  I don't know, man.  Raccoons are, like, vicious.  They have sharp claws.  Some pit bulls have big teeth.  I think a pit bull would have a problem with a raccoon.  Yeah, pit bulls just got to...  I think a lot of animals would have a problem with a raccoon.  But somebody said that rats could take out raccoons.  What, do they work together or something?  Rats are fucking nasty, though.  A ton of rats could probably take out a raccoon,  but there would be some rat casualties, I'm sure. 
[00:16:00]  There's no way every rat would survive.  We need an animal expert on our show.  Me and Bobby were walking last night.  I went out with Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  We were walking down...  We saw a brand-new building on...  I think it was the 8th and 40-something.  So we're walking down the side street,  and there was rats running back and forth,  and Bob would walk in the street.  I did, too, because...  Oh, fuck yeah.  I wasn't going to, though.  But then I was like, I talked shit.  I was like, what the fuck's the matter with you?  They're like, I got Bobby here.  He's like, go ahead, dude, you walk through them.  I'm like, no.  Wait, they were on the sidewalk?  Yeah, between...  You're going back between the garbage cans and the building. 
[00:16:30]  So you'd have to walk between them on the sidewalk.  And Bobby gave me another bandolier,  because he gave me a bandolier.  I left it in Cleveland, you know, by mistake.  You gave me another one?  So he gave me another one.  He goes, bring your old bandolier over, dude.  And I'm like, I think I left it in Cleveland.  You didn't get the hint?  How neat he...  He just keeps handing you bandoliers.  Well, he brought me a medium, and that one was really cool,  but I kept leaving it in his house, and I forgot.  So then Don, his wife, gave it to me.  He goes, now you get your...  You know, take it.  So when I left, I hung out on his doorknob. 
[00:17:00]  So he'll probably notice it this morning.  He's coming in today.  Yeah, it's 7.30.  And there's rumors that he's bringing me a bandolier.  Oh, fuck.  He's going to come in and yell at me.  Oh.  Fuck, dude.  I love seeing city rats, though.  I'm a big fan.  I'm not brave to get really close, but I love checking them out.  Do they bother you if...  I had one.  I...  If you get too close, because they're very territorial.  If you're walking down the sidewalk...  Well, I told the story once. 
[00:17:30]  We were out late, drinking and shit, a bunch of people from Philly, and we're walking down  one of the dark brownstone-type streets in my neighborhood.  Which is where they're all over those streets.  Right.  And we saw a rat, and we're like, cool.  And just like you, we saw it kind of go into the darkness, into like the garbage pail area  in front of the brownstone.  So we're like, fuck, let's take a peek.  So we kind of leaned in to try to see where it was, and he hissed.  This thing hissed at us.  And we jumped like little fucking girls.  Yeah.  And literally ran, you know, about 10, 15 feet away. 
[00:18:00]  Immediately.  It wasn't even like a question to stick around.  So I don't know.  I guess we got too close to whatever the fuck he was doing.  Well, maybe there's babies.  You seem like crazy.  Like at 4.30, 5 o'clock in the morning when I'm walking, especially because my parking  lot, I pass by a supermarket.  Right.  They love that supermarket.  Like every morning, they're right outside there.  Which one?  Because now I want to hang out there.  It's on the corner of 50th and 9th, and 8th. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  There's a park that made the newspaper, and they probably don't want me to bring it up.  Because they, you know, everyone forgot.  It was like, it was hot for a day.  Outside the Plaza Hotel here in New York City, there's a little park.  If you make it to New York, it's actually across the street from the plaza to the right  of Central Park.  Because that's the corner of Central Park right there.  The Apple Store is there.  Well, that's on the other side.  It's like toward the park.  It's a tiny little park right next to where Central Park starts. 
[00:19:00]  The southeast corner to the right of that is a tiny little park.  It is infested with rats.  And the paper did something on it.  And me and Roland went down there after this article was in the paper.  I'm like, I'm going to fucking film this, right?  Jimmy, as soon as the sun goes down, they start peeking their heads out.  And if you see the grass and the bushes, they're all worn away because the rats have made these  crazy trails all over this little park.  And what is going on? 
[00:19:30]  Because the horse and buggies are over there, and they're feeding the horses, so all the  feed is on the ground.  That's what the rats want.  Can they get rid of that fucking system, please?  Get rid of the horse and buggies?  They're almost there.  There's a lot less.  But all of a sudden, these stupid tourists, because they have no idea that this park is  infested.  And when it gets dark, they start coming out.  We were watching these rats getting within 10 feet of tourists without them having an  idea that there were rats all over the fucking place. 
[00:20:00]  Because if you're not looking for it, you're looking at other shit.  You're taking pictures of buildings.  You're asking the horse guy how much for a ride, all that shit.  People were sitting on little benches with rats right behind them, and they had no idea.  But they're fast as fuck, so I didn't get the best of it.  You got some good footage, though.  You know, this is around the comedy cell.  It's like that down by Washington Square.  They were always, and across the street, those old million-dollar brownstones.  You spent all that money in a brownstone.  They're beautiful properties, but you can't stop the rats. 
[00:20:30]  I think those people leave their garbage outside.  They have special garbage areas that the rats can get to, whereas in big buildings, it's  usually inside.  Well, they say, I read a whole book on rats, and it was fascinating.  It really was, because the rats that we have...  I have the book.  I just haven't read it yet.  It's called Rats, right?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a little wordy at times, to be honest with you.  You get the point.  But there's no rat in that.  I fucked with a lady.  A lady was walking her dog in front of a huge pile of garbage, a tiny little dog. 
[00:21:00]  And I said, hey, watch out for the rat.  And she jumped and pulled her dog pretty much in the air to get the dog away from the pile  of garbage.  But the book says, there are more rats in New York City than people.  Imagine that.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  Dr. Steve wants to answer the question about pertussis.  Oh, good.  Is it pertussis, Dr. Steve?  Yeah.  So we're in this weird area where we don't know if Ant was kidding or not when he said  he has pertussis. 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  But see, that's a bit highbrow that he's kidding and using a word that most of us didn't  even know.  So that's why I'm confused.  Yeah.  I wonder where he got that word from.  No, I don't know.  From you, Dr. Steve?  I think you have pertussis.  I'm not saying.  Pertussis is...  Wait, are you the one fucking handing doctor memos to him?  No.  I don't know.  Wait.  So he doesn't even know if he has pertussis?  No, I don't know.  I'm not saying that.  So I'm just, you know, I just asked a question. 
[00:22:00]  He's got pertussis.  So he called with some symptoms and he threw the word pertussis at him?  No, I'm not saying that I said anything.  I just asked a question.  You know, I wonder where he got that from.  That's all.  But you laughed.  You brought it up, not me.  Do you think he has it or no?  No, I don't know.  I can't say that, but I can tell you something about pertussis if you want to know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pertussis.  I mean, pertussis, look. 
[00:22:30]  What you're going to say is if he has it, you should run away.  Well, it's highly contagious.  Is it a bacterial disease?  It is a bacterial disease.  And see, the thing is that people get quote unquote colds, right?  And everybody understands that viruses are not treatable with antibiotics.  But this is one of those things that kind of acts like a cold in the beginning and actually is treatable with antibiotics. 
[00:23:00]  And the hallmark of it is in adults is that you get this crazy cough with it.  And you'll start coughing when you laugh or you'll cough so much you get these racking coughing fits until you puke.  And when you hear that symptom in an adult, you have to think about whooping cough or pertussis.  And, you know, in kids, we vaccinate them for this. 
[00:23:30]  Sure.  And you know, it can be life threatening illness in kids or it could be really severe to the point where it's worth vaccinating kids for it.  But, you know, that vaccine that you got when you're a kid starts to wear off after a while.  An adult can get it, too.  And you have to be vaccinated for pertussis again or you can get it.  So let me ask you, do you think it's hard to say?  I think Anthony was just kidding when he said pertussis. 
[00:24:00]  A lot of people say no one kids and uses the word pertussis at the same time.  Anthony is a smart guy, though, and he probably was joking.  I go on the record and say Anthony was joking.  And I haven't spoken to him.  It's just literally just a guess.  Dr. Steve?  Yeah, what kind of symptoms has he got?  Because, I mean, adults can...  He can't stop drinking.  Likes really young girls.  Hot tubs.  No, he was...  Apparently, I guess he was...  I was just following, you know, just the Twitter stuff like everybody else.  I just... 
[00:24:30]  I didn't know he was ill until I got the email.  And sent the email to all of us.  He goes, look, the cough is really bad.  Right.  And I guess he had it on Friday.  And he was sick last week.  Legitimately sick.  I mean, he may have something.  It's a cold.  Yeah.  Yeah, the thing about adult pertussis is it can last up to six weeks.  I don't know.  So I may have it, too, because I was with Ant and the guys in Cleveland.  So if he was sick then, I'm hoping that maybe I'm in the cold phase of it right now. 
[00:25:00]  So you got pertussis, too?  I don't know.  If I do, you guys should, because you're with him more than me.  I just made love to him.  That's a...  That's a...  No, I have a sore throat.  It's scratchy.  Oh, my God.  Sam, you're going to be so sick of your wedding.  What can I take for my pertussis?  Sam's four weeks out.  Four, I think.  Yeah.  A little less than four weeks from getting made.  And if I have a cold, I can feel it's going to be a scratchy fucking Lulu.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to be a bad one.  So what should I take to avoid pertussis? 
[00:25:30]  Well, if it is pertussis, you know, the initial symptoms start off like a common cold, and  then about 10 to 12 days later, you start this horrendous cough.  And if you wait till you get the cough phase, a lot of times it's not very treatable after  that.  So what can you take for the first 10 days of pertussis?  It's erythromycin or azithromycin, which is the...  Of the Z-Pak?  Z-Pak, yeah.  And, you know, so a lot of doctors throw these damn Z-Paks around, and most of the time they're 
[00:26:00]  treating a common cold that's completely worthless, and they've gotten afraid to treat anybody  with antibiotics.  And, you know, people say, well, I need an antibiotic, and, you know, the response is  all hell, you know, antibiotics don't treat colds.  But this is one of those weird instances where an antibiotic is useful.  It's really better, ultimately, which won't help you, Jim, if you've already contracted 
[00:26:30]  this, but for adults to get a damn pertussis vaccine, and then they don't have to worry  about this.  I don't know if I've contracted it or not.  I'm only...  Yeah, I don't know either.  I'm not trying to make a diagnosis over the telephone, but...  Yeah.  I don't feel...  I don't feel that bad.  I mean, he's a little scratchy.  I got breaking news.  Anthony was trying to say Robitussin, but he was drunk and slurring his words, so...  That could be.  So he's all right.  He'll be back.  All right, Dr. Steve, before you pour the hell out of everybody, I'm going to let you  go. 
[00:27:00]  Thank you for that article, by the way.  You sent me a good one on AIDS?  No, no, no, no, no.  I sent him one on that.  Oh, on the black hole...  Yes.  Oh, fuck that shit.  Dr. Steve and I talk more...  We very rarely talk medically.  We talk more about...  Astronomy?  Astronomy, yeah.  I talk and he lectures about it because he knows what he's talking about.  I don't want to know.  I did see a headline about something about something swallowing up planets.  A star was getting gobbled up by a black hole, and they have...  It's a two-billion-year-old image, though, so that's done already. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, but they can see it happening in real time, you know, which is amazing.  Because the light is here now.  We think about this stuff all being completely static, but when you get it high enough resolution,  you can actually see things change on it.  Wait, so you can see something that happened two billion years ago?  Yeah.  That's...  I can't even wrap my mind around that.  No, it's amazing.  Well, you see, we've talked about...  So why can't we see, like, what was going on on this planet?  You see in the past every day the sun. 
[00:28:00]  You're seeing the sun eight minutes ago.  The sun is eight minutes...  Every time you see sunlight, if the sun blew up, you wouldn't see it for eight minutes.  All right, so figure out that technology so we could watch what was going on on this  Earth.  That's what they're working on.  How do you do that?  Do you have to go to another planet to do that?  Yeah, you'd have to be...  You'd have to already be two billion light years away to be able to...  All right, so let's do that.  And then you could get all your questions answered about Jesus and such.  Yeah, we really do need...  There's a great science fiction book, by the way, by Orson Scott Card.  That's exactly what it's about. 
[00:28:30]  It's called Past Watch.  It's where they found a viewer that they could look into the past, and it did solve a lot  of questions like that.  So that's all we have to do?  Yeah, that's all you have to do is just invent a...  Could you watch your whole life from somewhere else?  ...look in the past.  And if you want to play the flute, just blow in one end and move your hands up and down  on the other.  I mean, it's that simple.  No, let me ask you, what was... 
[00:29:00]  Are you drunk?  Oh, shit.  After Steve's drunk.  They were talking about this star, right?  They said this star is getting sucked into something.  Right.  But it says it's being blown out the other side, about 20 million miles an hour.  What's it being blown out the other side of?  Well, what happens with a black hole is it's got a thing called an accretion disc around it,  and that's where a matter falls in and starts making this disc around the outside of the  black hole, and it starts spinning faster and faster and faster until it gets very close 
[00:29:30]  to the speed of light before it falls into the black hole itself.  All that compression of that matter as it spirals inward creates a lot of energy, and it creates  magnetic fields.  And the weird thing is that those magnetic fields will end up going perpendicular to  the accretion disc, and it'll shoot matter.  What does that mean, perpendicular, like to the accretion?  I don't know what that means.  Well, it's actually, okay, if the disc is in one plane, then the magnetic fields are shooting 
[00:30:00]  out at right angles to that plane.  Okay.  Okay?  And that will cause matter to fall into that magnetic field and get shot down, or, you  know, shot away from the black hole at right angles, and it causes a jet.  And the speeds are just unbelievable.  They're very close to the speed of light.  So now, wait a minute, is the accretion disc beyond the event horizon?  Yes.  It's just outside. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, it's beyond it in the sense that it's not in it?  That's right, yes.  Oh, okay, I'm thinking it's past it already.  No, no, no, if it's past it already, nothing could come out except for that so-called hawking  radiation.  That's the only thing that can escape it.  Well, that's what I was asking.  So this is stuff right before the event horizon that gets shot out?  Yes.  Now, what is the hawking radiation?  Well, hawking radiation, that's an interesting thing.  There was a postulate that black holes actually have a temperature, but if they have a temperature, 
[00:31:00]  that means that something must be escaping from them.  Why?  Well, because a temperature implies that you are radiating at some temperature, right?  I mean, temperature is infrared radiation or microwave radiation or some sort of radiation.  So how could a black hole have a temperature if nothing can escape from it?  I'd rather have pertussis than listen to this.  Holy fuck.  Well, that's what the black hole has.  That's pertussis when it coughs out matter beyond the event horizon. 
[00:31:30]  That's the black hole's pertussis.  I have joined 95% of our audience as we all check our Twitters right now.  Anything else?  Wait, finish.  Holy fuck.  Is it going to be contagious for six weeks?  I hope so.  No, it won't necessarily be contagious for the whole six weeks.  Well, I just want to know if he was joking.  If he's joking, it's hilarious because I'm not...  These guys had to come in in the middle of the night to disinfect the place.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, I don't know if he was joking. 
[00:32:00]  But I think you've got to use a word that most people would know if you're going to joke, I think.  Yeah, well...  But I have a feeling that you might have threw a word like pertussis in his head, Dr. Steve.  Well, you know me better than to...  Are you just throwing words around?  No, I don't...  Worst case scenario, words?  No, wait, what about...  You've got to finish the black hole story.  Why?  Oh, okay.  I'm dying to know.  What happened?  Where were we with the black hole?  We were at the point where it has a temperature, which, of course, means that it's radiating. 
[00:32:30]  But if it's radiating...  It has to be radiating something.  So how can it radiate?  Well, this is how it happens.  In empty space, particles and their antiparticles are being created all the time out of nothing.  Because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, don't worry about it, dictates that at small enough scales that you can make particles and antiparticles out of nothing, and then they immediately annihilate each other. 
[00:33:00]  Dr. Steve, you do realize there are naked women on the Internet, right?  Yes, right.  All right.  Well, there are naked particles and antiparticles in space.  So at the event horizon, if you make an antiparticle and a particle, one of them falls into the event horizon.  Now it becomes a real particle because it can't annihilate itself.  The other one goes shooting off into space, and that's how black holes radiate.  And it's at a very low temperature, and the temperature gets higher and higher as the black hole evaporates. 
[00:33:30]  And eventually, all black holes, you know, 20 trillion, quadrillion years from now will evaporate into nothing through that mechanism of Hawking radiation.  So, oh, so technically no black holes have been finished off yet?  No, no, no, no, no.  It would take way, way, way longer than the age of the universe.  But the more the curvature, in other words, the smaller the black hole, the faster they'll radiate. 
[00:34:00]  And that's why these black holes that are being generated in that CERN, Large Hadron Collider, in Europe are not a problem for it.  Because people were worried they were going to make black holes in this thing that was going to eat up the earth or something.  Right.  But they're so small that they just immediately evaporate by the mechanism of Hawking radiation.  How big is a black hole, roughly?  How big is it?  Yeah.  Like if you, like say you found one and you opened up a black hole ride where you could zip around and throw eggs at the event horizon, but you wouldn't get sucked in. 
[00:34:30]  And you could just watch your egg get sucked in.  Yeah.  The event horizon is at this distance called the Schwarzschild.  What?  Schwarzschild.  It's the event horizon distance.  The black hole itself is an infinitesimal point at the center of the event horizon. 
[00:35:00]  The event horizon can be, it depends on the mass of the black hole.  So, for example, the event.  I didn't know what he was talking about.  I did.  Oh, my God.  I was quite enjoying that.  You do realize how early it is, right?  I can't follow science conversations.  Oh, my God.  I normally can either, but that one I could.  I do wish he was sitting next to me in class, though.  Fuck.  I would have got A's.  An infinitesimal point in the center of the event horizon.  I get that.  Yeah.  It's the bottom of the drain.  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:35:30]  For the ten people still listening, they get it, too.  I think people are more interested in this than you think.  That's why I like the Dr. Kaku.  I like how he breaks it down to fairy tales.  That's not, ooh.  I like it.  That's going to rub Dr. Steve the wrong way that you just said that.  Well, tough shit.  Sometimes, you know, you need the cliff notes.  You like Dr. Kaku's delivery of this stuff better than Dr. Steve's?  Absolutely.  Ouch.  I like Dr. Steve.  We're friends, but absolutely.  I don't.  I would rather hear Dr. Kaku discuss it like Dr. Steve.  Like, I know Kaku knows that stuff, but he won't say it like that. 
[00:36:00]  Like, he wouldn't just say what Steve said.  He would go, oh, it's like if you're rolling a basketball.  No, I get it.  I'm not rolling a basketball.  I want to hear about the earth being swallowed.  Well, he does it in his own fashion.  But he doesn't teach you anything.  That's why he has a TV show, and that's why Dr. Steve is treating people in the last week  of their lives.  But that guy, Dr. Kaku gives you fairy tales.  I like that.  I can sleep at night.  You never go beyond what he's saying.  I could sleep without fucking having nightmares. 
[00:36:30]  So when I think about how vast the universe is, I go back to Dr. Kaku and go, oh, he was,  oh, that's right.  It's just a fairy tale.  You know how Dr. Kaku would describe it?  Oh, a long time.  Right.  But how long?  Dr. Steve gives you real science numbers.  He sounds like a guy who knows science.  All right.  Now there's more rumors.  Kurt Love.  Does Kurt Love hang out with Ant at all?  I don't think so.  He spent a lot of time with Bobo.  Well, then why is he writing, Ant definitely has pertussis.  This has been dragging on for three weeks now.  It is not a bit in any way, shape, or form.  I got it from him going to the doctor at noon. 
[00:37:00]  Jesus.  How come Kurt Love knows everything?  I don't know.  Who is this guy?  Kurt Love's got all the facts.  Where did he come from?  I don't know, man.  I don't feel like getting the pertussis.  I don't need pertussis at all.  And then Jess will get pertussis.  Well, it all depends.  Her vagina will get pertussis.  Yeah, she'll have vaginal pertussis.  How many pertussis?  I mean, I don't mind one tussis. 
[00:37:30]  Jimmy, we're going to take a break and eat.  We're going to talk about Cleveland because it's been a week.  Ten days, we haven't seen you.  I felt that was a big success for the radio show.  I don't know what I was allowed to say, so we waited for you.  But I want to talk about your taping in Cleveland.  I want to talk about the Open, if we can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think people know.  I want to talk about some of the behind-the-scenes shit in the Open that you were telling me,  which was fantastic.  So I'm just going to follow your lead on that, if that's okay.  Sure.  I was debating not mentioning it, but then I got, but now I'm going to it. 
[00:38:00]  I'll tell you why.  I was debating, because people, the fans have been really, I'll say this.  We asked beforehand, certain things, just don't Twitter or whatever, because you don't  ruin it for the next people.  And I'll tell you, I really mean this.  The fans are fucking amazing.  They step up when they have to.  They really have been un-fucking-believable with not blowing things.  And they've been, I can't tell you how nice it's been.  The fans haven't been wrecking everything.  They've been very cool with this.  They absolutely step up when they have to. 
[00:38:30]  Cool.  We lost to Beastie Boy.  Yeah, it sucks.  47.  Don't you start thinking, I Twittered this too, you start thinking in terms of how old  you are.  Like, I'm 43, he was 47.  I'm like, God, fuck, man, that's like my age.  Yeah.  Like, people are dying of cancer at my age.  They die of cancer before your age.  They die at 20, but I mean, now it becomes...  Well, the older you get, there's more shit that can affect you, is what you're talking  about.  Stroke, cancer.  When you're a teenager, your friends typically aren't dying of stroke and cancer, but now 
[00:39:00]  it's like, fuck, man, this is the age where it starts happening.  That's why you gotta try to take care of yourself as best you can, I guess.  Adam died, man.  An MCA of the Beastie Boys, 47.  Which one was he?  I never know who's who.  Well, he was MCA.  You don't know his picture?  I know his picture, but I don't know which voice he was.  I can never tell the voice apart.  You know what?  I'm gonna be honest with you, I can't either at times, so I'm not gonna try to answer  that guy.  He was on our show, too.  He was a cool guy.  Adam was a cool guy. 
[00:39:30]  You know what's weird?  Like, when people die, Twitter either beats the shit out of you, in most cases they beat  the shit out of you.  Every once in a while, there's, like, respect across the board, and that's what Adam got.  Yeah.  Because I follow this shit on Twitter closely, and I'm like, holy fuck, the love and respect  for this guy.  Like, when Patrice died, the same fucking thing.  You know, people didn't go for the...  You know, there were a couple, like, whatever, guys that went for the easy joke, but in general,  you see the masses going for respect and love, and they did with this Adam guy, MCA, on Twitter. 
[00:40:00]  It's weird, like, respected artists who die young of natural causes.  I mean, that's what him and Patrice had in common, is they're both young guys, relatively  speaking, both very respected, and they died of natural...  Right.  It's like, oof.  I respect Coldplay a little more today.  Did you see the tribute they did?  Uh-uh.  They were at the Hollywood Bowl, I think, and Chris Martin sat down at the piano and fucking  did a very emotional, heartfelt version of You Gotta Fight For Your Right To Party, which 
[00:40:30]  is so weird, because that's a party song, and he made it into this very, very emotional  song.  Don't you love when singers...  There's something to be said for a singer that does that to another song.  I really like when they do that.  Really strange, but it worked, so I want to go to break with this.  The Adol song?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, cool.  Coldplay doing Fight For Your Right. 
[00:41:00]  When you wake up late for school, and you don't want to go, and you ask your mom, please, but  she still says no.  She missed two classes, but no homework, and your teacher preaches class like it's some kind of 
[00:41:30]  time.  You gotta fight for your right to party.  It's a party night  When your pops got you smoking and he said no way  Oh, that hypocrite smokes two packs a day 
[00:42:00]  They're living at home in such a drag  Now your mom threw away your best porn, old man  But you gotta fight for your right to party 
[00:42:30]  You gotta fight for your right to party  You gotta fight for your right to party  You gotta fight for your right to party  Let's do it together. 
[00:43:00]  Let's do it together. 
[00:43:30]  Let's do it together. 
[00:44:00]  Let's do it together. 
[00:44:30]  Let's do it together. 
[00:45:00]  Cleared of child porn charges nine years ago by just telling people he was doing research.  They had him caught, man.  Did they?  Yeah.  But then again, you weren't, you know, if it's me or you, you're fucked.  But if you wrote Won't Get Fooled Again, then I think they give you a little leeway to get out of shit. 
[00:45:30]  I truly believe that shit happens out there.  They had him.  They did.  And then he turned around and goes, nah, I was doing a little research.  For a book or something?  Did that book ever come out?  I don't know.  So he was clear of all charges, all child porn charges.  Maybe the pictures weren't that bad.  Then maybe they weren't what people first thought they were.  Maybe they weren't hardcore.  Who knows?  I guess.  Give them the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah, maybe there's other stuff that he had downloaded where they could see his history.  Yeah.  And they knew he was being honest. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Fair enough.  I don't know.  We got the Avengers setting a box office record.  200 million for the weekend?  Holy fuck.  It's just here.  What?  And that's just in the States.  Yeah, because it already did gangbusters overseas, right?  It's been close to 700 million total so far.  And we didn't get a superhero, Jimmy.  I thought you guys got two of them.  No.  Well.  We didn't get a superhero.  Wait, what happened?  I protested and decided not to do one of the interviews because we didn't get a superhero. 
[00:46:30]  We got Clark Gregg, who's a big person in the agency in the film.  By the way, between the two interviews, we picked the right guy.  Clark Gregg, a lot of fun.  I like that guy.  So is Loki.  I, Loki's, you know.  Who's Loki?  I don't know.  He's the villain.  He's in it like almost every scene in the movie.  So why didn't you do him?  I didn't feel like it.  You didn't take both kinds of adventures?  No, they decided to franchise the Loki interview.  Sam was Anthony and E-Rock was Opie's.  Wow.  We didn't feel like it. 
[00:47:00]  You guys are crazy.  Yeah.  It was fun.  One of the biggest movies of all time.  So I don't need that on my resume.  It was fun to hear fucking Sam and E-Rock do us.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Okay.  But then I got mad because Loki was in Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen's film.  Right.  He played...  I don't know what's his name.  Oh, fuck.  And he was really good in it.  It's too early.  I can't remember.  So I would have talked to him about that movie.  That movie.  Did you ever see Midnight in Paris? 
[00:47:30]  Loved it.  Amazing.  Loved it.  Conception.  F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Yeah, F. Scott.  Okay, good.  F. Scott Fitzgerald.  There's some brilliant points Woody made about every era you're in, you think the golden  era was then.  Right.  And then when you go back to the golden era, you realize when they thought the golden  era were like, oh, wow.  Right.  He's a smart guy, man.  Well, every generation thinks they're the best.  Every generation thinks they're the best generation.  But you never consider yourself the golden era.  Like, you always look back to a time.  That was better?  Yeah.  And he looks back to his...  The whole thing was about him to his golden era.  And people back then probably thought the one before that. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  I feel like the 90s were way better than what we're going through now.  But I mean, you know.  I don't know.  In the end, that's probably bullshit, too.  You know?  It's all bullshit.  So the Avengers did well and Loki did well in the movie?  Yeah.  Scarlett Johansson was the lead guest when I was on Leno.  She was on a segment.  I saw you tweet.  She's amazing.  We saw her in person.  Fuck who she said?  We sort of said hi to her.  We were all standing there awkwardly.  At the Radiohead show.  Oh, okay.  Because she was with Ryan Reynolds.  And we just had Ryan Reynolds on the show a couple days prior. 
[00:48:30]  So we're kind of talking to Ryan Reynolds as she's standing there just looking all fucking  beautiful and shit.  She looked good.  We kind of nodded at each other.  So I feel like I officially met her.  Did you meet her?  Well, I already have a picture with her.  So she was talking.  I waited until after the show.  And I wanted to get my photo with her signed.  And she was talking to one of the guys from the band.  Right.  They had a house.  And they lived near each other.  So they were chatting.  And I was like, could you sign it?  And she goes, oh, yeah.  She goes, you were really funny.  She saw the segment. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  So she's like, we were very funny.  How were those lips?  She's a fucking knockout in person.  How was that juicy ass?  She was wearing a white, tight, like form-fitting dress.  Yeah.  I like when her hair is up better.  I prefer that.  There's something about that.  I just like that look.  Right.  And she was beautiful, man.  And she's very friendly, too.  There's nothing about her not to like.  No, she's very, very personable.  She was very nice.  She's hot.  And she's pleasant when you meet her.  Yeah, of course.  God damn it.  She's fantastic. 
[00:49:30]  So I guess the Avengers did well.  I'm not going to see that movie, though.  Why not?  Too much action.  Why don't we get Chris?  The guy with Captain America.  I don't remember his last name.  I think he's filming.  He hasn't really done any press that I've seen.  Well, he owes us one.  We took him for a shitty movie.  A shitty rom-com.  You like superhero movies.  You should see The Avengers.  Yeah, I do like superhero.  There's too many superheroes, though.  And we didn't interview any of them.  Why don't we get a superhero?  Nobody did.  There's like ten superheroes in this movie.  We couldn't get one.  Did Robert Downey do press,  or just, like, Leno, Letterman type stuff?  Yeah, no.  Oh, he did Leno the next night.  We should have got Chris Evans. 
[00:50:00]  Chris Evans.  He's a fan from the old days.  He used to listen to us when we were at AF.  He told me personally.  He might not have done press if he's working.  And then we took him with that rom-com with Anna Faris, I think.  That was the one, right?  It was an alright movie.  But we did him a favor.  He owes us.  You should come to terms with the fact that Loki was in almost every scene of the movie.  He was in more parts of the movie than any of the superheroes were.  See, that's the beauty of me, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, that it blew it off like it was nothing. 
[00:50:30]  Were his people pissed?  And Roland's saying, we got Chris for Captain America, not the rom-com.  Oh.  Did we?  That's what Roland's saying.  Alright.  Then he doesn't owe us.  We said no to Jack Black again.  Breaking news.  He wants to come in with that stupid fucking band.  No.  He will only do our show with that stupid fucking band.  And then his stupid fucking partner gives us all these dirty looks and this stupid attitude. 
[00:51:00]  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Enough with this Jack Black guy.  A million movies have gone by and finally he wants to come back on the show with that stupid band.  What is the band?  Tenacious D.  Tenacious D.  I don't acknowledge him either.  I liked the first year of that band.  It was kind of cool, but enough already.  If you can't come in for movies, we're not taking you for your stupid band with your partner that has some weird fucking attitude.  He doesn't like you.  No thank you. 
[00:51:30]  What?  His partner was giving you dirty looks?  He's a passive-aggressive type guy.  Gives you looks like he's bigger than everybody.  No, you're not.  Shut up.  Enough with those guys.  Is that good, Jimmy?  Well, I know when I said hi to Jack Black at the Jay Leno show, he didn't return the hello.  Really?  When was this?  No, he just cried it a while ago.  That's why.  So for every time for me, I don't care if I ever speak to him.  No, he's one of those.  He doesn't know who I am.  I mean, he doesn't know who I am, but I still thought he was just kind of rude.  Yeah, how about you be a human being?  Yeah.  He's one of those guys that absolutely changed drastically when he became big. 
[00:52:00]  We've seen a lot of these guys through many, many parts of their career, and I like the guys that stay fucking the same.  Plus, I mean, he just had the one big, he just had School of Rock.  What?  He's been in a shitload of movies.  I saw Luke Wilson at an eatery, and I actually didn't get a picture with him because I didn't know who he was.  I know his name, but I don't know.  I didn't know who he was.  You don't know who Luke Wilson is?  Wouldn't know him if he walked right by.  He's a big star.  Well, no, but no, Owen's a big star.  He's known.  No, Luke's up there.  Is he? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, Luke's up there.  Yeah.  Absolutely, Luke Wilson is up there.  All right.  Fuck him.  So that's what we said to Tenacious Day.  Yes.  Tough guys that we are.  Ouch.  You didn't watch any sports, did you?  No.  You didn't see the injury?  Did you see the picture of the injury?  No.  The Knicks guard.  Here.  Open up the paper.  He dislocated his kneecap.  My boy.  I know we're not a big sports show, but you've got to see the dislocated kneecap. 
[00:53:00]  Well, I know Rivera's out.  That's the only sports news I've heard is that Mariano's out for the season.  Out for the season?  Well, they were basically saying that's it for his career, but he, I think it was Saturday, he said,  fuck that.  I'm coming back.  Put it down.  Write it down in big letters.  I ain't going down like this, because a lot of people just assumed that was it for his career.  Yeah, Baron Davis suffers a career-ending right knee injury.  Look at his fucking knee in this video, Jimmy.  Look at it. 
[00:53:30]  Look at it.  It popped out.  His fucking kneecap dislocated.  It looks like a star.  Huh?  It looks like, can we see it?  People were so freaked out.  A few of the players on the court, including some of the Miami Heat, they said they almost started crying.  They call a travel on Davis, who's been playing all season with all sorts of injuries.  That's his kneecap popped out to the side.  You see that knee look, something didn't look right, that knee there.  Look at everyone.  They don't want to look. 
[00:54:00]  Tyson Chandler doesn't want to look at it.  See?  They're freaked out.  He's calling out more help.  Davis goes down.  You can see.  The pain that guy has got to be in right there.  I can't even imagine.  Roger Hines, the head athletic trainer out there.  He decoyed Stoudemire Anthony.  You're looking at a guy that just ended his career.  Is that a career ender?  Well, they're going to find out today if they can operate.  He's not that old.  He just came back from a pretty serious injury.  He's a really good point guard, too. 
[00:54:30]  Now the Knicks are fucked.  They don't have a point guard right now, really.  God, that sucks.  You've got the Jeremy Lin.  He's out.  But rumor has it he might try to suit up for game five.  What did he just jump?  Oh, that's right.  The player.  He jumped up and just came down on it, huh?  No, he was driving toward the hoop, and I guess he just planted wrong or something.  I don't know.  It's amazing how fast your career could end fucking in athletics.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I think the NBA, they did this shortened season where they had to play a lot, and I  think they're just wearing out guys.  It seems like a lot of guys are getting some pretty serious injuries. 
[00:55:00]  I wonder if that's wear and tear from just playing a shitload of games in a small amount  of time.  I don't know.  That's just a guess.  But the Knicks won, so we go to game five in Miami.  Heat, Knicks.  Good for the Knicks.  But they have a lot of injuries.  A lot of injuries.  We want to play, Jimmy, the cloud guy for you.  Okay.  Or you want to hear Ted Nugent.  I heard Ted Nugent already. 
[00:55:30]  You did?  The explosion when he got weird with the reporter.  Oh, we don't need to play this then, sir.  Yeah, I don't care about Ted Nugent.  Jimmy heard it.  What about the audience?  They probably heard it.  They Google.  That's a lot of assumptions.  Actually, I want to ask Jimmy about Cleveland.  We had a good time up there.  I think it was a big success for the show.  The fucking fans were amazing.  We had a really good turnout for that event.  I mean, really good for that Friday event.  Yeah, I was scared because we've done all the breaks on Cleveland, but the first time we're  seeing you, we were walking to the Blind Pig, and I'm like, oh my God, there's no one 
[00:56:00]  around.  There was no one outside the Blind Pig.  There was no one at any of the other bars.  And it's Friday happy hour.  And then opened those doors, and it was packed.  Yeah, I knew this would be good.  Fucking packed.  Because Gary was sending an email saying, like, there's 30 people outside, but this was  hours, 100 people outside.  And this was, like, way before the gig.  And I'm like, if they're lined up, it's going to be a good event.  Right.  And it was.  It was great.  Yeah, there were 400 or 500 people in there, I guess. 
[00:56:30]  Whatever they could fill, it was either at or over capacity.  Yeah, I don't know exactly.  At least 400, I believe.  So that was great.  The broadcast was great.  The people in Cleveland were great.  Unbelievable.  And then the taping for your special was awesome.  One of the two, we did two shows, early show, late show.  And one of my points that I had made to them was, it's amazing when we were getting ready  to shoot.  I'm on stage at, like, 5 o'clock, just going over sound cues, because there's a video 
[00:57:00]  for my open.  And so we're doing it.  And then the fucking union rep comes out.  This is why, by the way, we bring a show to Cleveland.  I want to film in Cleveland.  And the fucking union.  This is why people hate unions.  The union rep is standing there.  He's being a jerk off.  And then he starts going, we got to break these guys.  Got to break them.  Like, five minutes before.  Got to get that guy down.  Like, the lighting rig guy. 
[00:57:30]  And the guy who worked for New Wave, who's the production company, was being very nice.  He goes, okay.  He goes, could you just give us five minutes?  Because we've had some, because a lot of the local guys were not hitting the cues.  And he goes, ah, I got to charge you.  I've reached out the clock.  Seven guy.  Everything you hate about unions, this is what we dealt with in this house.  And they can be difficult all over.  But there's a difference between getting things for your guys, and taking care of yourself, and being unreasonable assholes. 
[00:58:00]  So the guy was being an unreasonable asshole.  You really needed those guys to get it right.  Right.  And the union guy was basically telling you, look.  Too bad, we got to go to break.  If we could.  Got to go to break.  Really?  I'm sure a lot of people are shooting specials in Cleveland.  I'm sure it happens every day.  Oh, that's right.  It doesn't.  Right.  So I don't expect to get things for free.  But when someone says, all right, can we just have five minutes?  Because we're just, I had to hold my wardrobe up and see how it read on camera.  And do a couple of lighting things.  Because we had to get lighting cues right. 
[00:58:30]  Because I wanted the room dark.  Louie and I had talked about that.  And he goes, our acts are kind of darker acts.  He goes, you want people in the dark because they feel better about laughing and stuff.  It's just the way it is.  It's human psychology.  There's something more intimate and freeing about being in the dark.  So I wanted the room dark.  So we had to go in with all these cues.  Where for Lenny, who is my opener, who did great, it would be a little bit more well-lit.  Because you've got to get a few crowd reaction shots for editing.  You have to.  Right.  You have to get a couple of shots here and there of something other than just Jim Norton. 
[00:59:00]  So if they want to cut or reverse the order of a bit.  Or if they want to pull a piece from the early show.  You can't just have a sloppy cut.  That's why they go to those crowd reaction shots.  Because they're pulling a piece from another show.  Or they're doing something.  So I said, I do not want a well-lit, Comedy Central-looking special.  And Epix has been great.  The network who I'm doing it for, the first run.  They're like, all right, whatever you want.  So we go over all these lighting cues.  My lighting is supposed to be 70% darker than Lenny's. 
[00:59:30]  Because he's just banging out 10 minutes.  He doesn't give a fuck.  So I go on.  And, of course, the lighting cue is wrong for the first show.  I am sitting.  I'm on stage.  And I'm looking at Opie, Anthony, Danny, Chris, the security guy.  And they're 30 rows back.  And I'm looking at you.  I can see Danny's dumb glasses.  There's something, a jib, the jib camera, which is the giant swoop across the entire room. 
[01:00:00]  I'm watching shadows creep across the pit.  I was out of my mind angry.  Anyone at that first show?  I want it to melt down in the middle of that show so badly because of that lighting cue.  And I said, I don't want camera guys running through the room.  Because when you're trying to sit there and enjoy a show, and you've got some fucking camera guy setting up right in front of you.  But they had it anyway.  There was a fucking camera guy running up and down.  They did stuff you didn't want.  Not only did I didn't want, but that I specifically said. 
[01:00:30]  Made clear.  Made clear.  So my question is, why did you just stop the show?  Thought of it.  Just because, I mean, you only had two shots at this.  You were taping an early show and a late show.  Then you were going to mix and match, obviously.  That's how these specials are made.  Always, yeah.  I went to a George Carlin show once, and I was in the front fucking row for one of his HBO tapings.  You don't see me because they used the whole second show.  You know what I mean?  Right, because Carlin had, even when Carlin would do them live, he had a safety show, I heard. 
[01:01:00]  Safety show.  Which was the night before.  And that's what I was at.  In case of a meltdown or a heart attack or whatever it was.  And he didn't need anything from the safety show, because I'm like, fuck, I was in the  front row for this.  But someone else is in my seat, if you watch the special.  But anyway, so I'm thinking to myself, because I only found out about this after the first  show, when you had a pretty severe meltdown after the show.  And that's when I learned that, man, you're a true professional, because you did not give  off the vibe during the show that you were beyond livid. 
[01:01:30]  See, that's my problem.  When I'm livid, everyone fucking knows it, unfortunately.  It's something I'm trying to work on.  Right.  But you were just as funny as I've ever seen you.  But inside, you wanted to fucking strangle somebody.  I was so unhappy during the first show, because I felt like it wasn't funny.  I was terrible.  And I felt like there was a couple of times I almost fainted.  I was overtired.  I was so fucking frustrated.  Because again, I'm looking at something.  That you didn't want.  That I didn't want.  So why didn't you stop the show?  I thought of it.  Because it wasn't like a basic, you know, basic show. 
[01:02:00]  You were taping your special.  Why didn't you just say, you know what?  I would have had a fucking meltdown and said, we're starting this thing over.  I'll tell you why.  And it did occur to me to go, hey, hey, could you dim the lights?  Or something.  Because I didn't know, if anything, what that would do to the dynamic of a show.  Yeah, okay.  A regular show, I would have just acknowledged and said, what the fuck?  Right.  But when you're shooting, people in the audience are uncomfortable to a certain degree.  Because they're fans.  They love me.  They know it's a big night.  They want to behave right. 
[01:02:30]  They don't know how to, you know what I mean?  They don't know exactly either, because for them, it's not a common thing either.  We're all, in a weird way, doing something that none of us are that used to doing.  I'm not used to it.  I taped a couple specials in 20 years.  Yeah, I know.  And the fans are very good.  They want you to succeed.  So I didn't know if stopping that would let people know, like, wow, this really is a weird,  different vibe than normal.  Right.  But I'm watching.  Dude, I'm on stage.  And I can see that camera guy setting up his tripod and another guy coming down.  And I'm, like, thinking this is a live fucking stand-up show. 
[01:03:00]  This is not a rock concert.  You're right.  So I went backstage after.  And, of course, they fucked up the most important lighting cue, which occurs at the end.  Yeah, don't give that away.  No, no, they fucked that up on the first show.  Yeah.  The second show, they got it 100% right.  But in the dressing room, I didn't realize you and Anthony were right next door and could  hear me going fucking bananas.  Oh, my God.  I've never, ever had a meltdown like I heard Jimmy have in Cleveland.  I was thinking that to myself.  I'm like, okay.  Because we went back after the first show thinking, wow, Jimmy fucking had a nice fucking 
[01:03:30]  show.  Now the second one's going to be a piece of cake because he at least has a really good  one in the can.  And we go back to this little green room they set up for us right next to Jimmy's.  And I could hear you yelling through cinder block.  Dude, I was out throwing shit, punching shit, it seemed like.  I've never.  I threw a sneaker to bounce off the wall and hit the director.  But I wasn't.  Ryan Pulido directed it.  I wasn't yelling at him because it wasn't Ryan's call.  I knew Ryan didn't fuck that up. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  And I wasn't mad at Kenny or Jonathan or any of the new wave guys or the epic people.  Like, I knew what happened was because, and it's harder for them to see in the truck because  when you're on stage, it looks different on camera than it does in the live venue.  But the live venue is what gets the reaction.  Right.  But when you're in the truck, it looked darker anyway.  So they wouldn't have caught that.  But I knew what happened was because they were a little bit rushed because the fucking  guy, hey, we got to go to break.  Got to go to break.  That fucking Robert Lozier looking jerk off union guy. 
[01:04:30]  But they don't give a fuck because they have no investment in it.  They don't give a fuck.  So I knew that what happened was because they were trying to hook up all these cues and there  weren't that many, but they had to be gotten right.  The guy just hit the wrong button.  And while I was on stage, he had Lenny's lighting cue.  So I knew that it was just some fucking careless, avoidable bullshit.  That's what it was in the end?  I believe so.  It had to be.  Wow.  Because they worked that stuff out because there's so many lights.  Right.  They have to work that out in advance. 
[01:05:00]  So you program all of it and then it's one button almost?  Yeah.  And then Ryan, the director, would go, okay, let me get the lighting cue for Jim's entrance.  And nothing would happen.  This is during rehearsal.  Right.  Because, you know, whenever you go to a show and they announce the person or the people,  the lights they call ballyhoo, whatever, the lights kind of flash.  I mean, that's all coordinated.  Right.  There's not just one guy flicking.  Right.  That's coordinated.  Pretty complicated.  The light cues hit on time and all that stuff.  Wow.  And for a stand-up show, there's very few light cues.  It's basically entrance and there was a little something I wanted to do at the end. 
[01:05:30]  And so walking on, I knew what had happened.  So I melted down.  I said, I want it fucking black in that room.  I want it dark.  And I was, and Ryan stayed, the director actually stayed with me until the show started and showed  me how dark it would be.  And the late show.  I got stuff out of the early show, though.  Right.  I hope he was very good.  You were very helpful because you came in and Kenny was talking to me.  But in those moments, you're very good. 
[01:06:00]  Like you're, you understand me for some reason and you were very helpful.  For some reason, that's my life.  I had, I had a, I had a perform under chaos when I was growing up.  So you try to, you know, you got to do some reasoning.  I was trying to, my whole job is to try to calm me down because I'm like, dude, you got  a second show.  You got to get your head together.  Look at this picture.  This is a screen cap.  We used, by the way, we used most of the set, I'd say a lot of the second show, but way  more of the early show than I thought we would.  There was a lot of bits that killed in the early show.  You were right.  I told you, I said, they'll still be able to use stuff from the first show. 
[01:06:30]  I'm amazed because I'll say it again.  You were hilarious.  And inside you wanted to fucking kill somebody.  If you knew the depression I had after, even after the late show.  I've never seen you like that.  And then backstage, I'm trying to, a bunch of us are trying to calm me down and get your  head in the right place.  I'm like, I, for the first time, I'm like, I don't know if he's going to be able to  fucking pull us off.  And you dramatically said to everyone, and you meant it, and it was worth saying.  You go, look, we're going to either live or die with the second show. 
[01:07:00]  And I'm like, wow.  Yeah, that was the show.  The special kind of hinge on that.  I'm like, wow.  I mean, you've been looking forward to this forever.  And now, you know, live or die on one out of the two shows is, I, I can't stress how  amazing that is and the pressure you got to feel.  And then you went up there and you just killed it.  I'm like, this guy is in no mood to fucking perform right now.  And you fucking killed it in the second show.  Well, the intro, I wanted your guys intro because, and the intro looks really good.  I've seen it.  Yeah.  Of course it's in.  And, uh, what happened was on the early show, I was like, you guys know, it was your 
[01:07:30]  Opie and Anthony.  They just stand up.  Of course you could.  It's because we're in the lobby basically with the lighting.  Right.  But on the late show, there's a fucking spot that hits you.  And that's what I wanted.  It's a special thing that way.  People knew you were there, but to have the light hit you, that's what you fucking want.  I got a picture from the late show.  Did I look good?  You looked really good, actually.  Very fuckable.  I'm trying not to, I mean, I'm straight away.  I still got it, right?  This is a screen grab from the late show.  Are you saying that again too much?  This is a screen grab.  How cool does this look from the late show?  Let me see.  Is this you?  Yes, from the back.  Oh, fuck yeah, man. 
[01:08:00]  There you go.  It's on the reverse.  That's how dark it was for the late show.  And that's what you want.  Yes.  I understand that because I've been to a lot of tapings and I hate those Comedy Central  tapings.  I've been to a million of them because you feel like when the audience is lit, you feel  like you've got to perform.  I even find myself kind of laughing a little harder or clapping because I'm like, fuck,  there's lights and cameras all over this place.  But you darken that shit.  And then people, I think, you know, absolutely react more genuinely, naturally. 
[01:08:30]  And they laugh more like you don't want applause breaks during a comedy show.  Occasionally, it's nice, but I don't try to make points that people go like this.  Like, I want them to laugh and agree if they want to agree.  Right.  But I would rather have them laughing.  But the early show was a very good crowd.  That was not their fault.  That the lighting was.  Yeah.  I mean, I kept thinking this is fucking not the way I want it to look.  Me and Ann came back to New York without you, went to L.A., and the whole week were  like, I hope we get to talk about the meltdown.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Holy fuck.  I went ballistic in between shows. 
[01:09:00]  But it wasn't me being a spoiled bitch.  It was something I had prepared for.  Oh, no, no.  It was justified.  Yeah, I had specifically said I wanted it.  It was absolutely justified.  I just couldn't believe the level you took it to.  I'm like, wow.  How the...  Because when I go off like that, I'm done for the day.  And it's something I really fucking hate about myself.  Like, when I get really pissed off about management, or maybe someone in studio, whatever, I'm  done for the day.  It's like a chemical's released in my body, and I just can't...  I can't go back to performing or doing a radio show, in my case. 
[01:09:30]  But you, for some...  You weren't done, man.  What happens?  You were able to just push that aside?  I knew I had one more show.  I mean, the reality was, like, I had worked very hard getting the intro together.  Yeah.  Um, and the video for the intro, and all that stuff.  And I just felt like I was letting everybody down.  Like, after the first show, I'm like...  It was weird.  Like, I wrote out an intro, and I got it videotaped.  Um, and I can't believe I pulled off the intro.  I can't believe I got that. 
[01:10:00]  It's fucking hilarious.  Thank you.  And I can't...  I think we can see what it is.  Are you questioning putting it in the special?  No part...  The first part I'm not going to talk about, because that will let people just see it.  Right.  But the other part, and here's the reason.  I wasn't going to talk about it, but I got, um...  I got Ozzy in the intro to my fucking special.  And, uh, I wasn't going to talk about it, because the fans have been amazing not twittering  about it and being respectful of the surprise element of it.  But we sent it out of respect.  I sent it to Sharon's people the day before we had Picture Lock to show them, what do you 
[01:10:30]  guys think, and, um, they fucking, they loved it, and they go, we would love to just give  us that first piece, and we will, uh, we'll Twitter it for you, and we'll, we'll Facebook  it, and announce that you're special, which I thought was so nice of them, so it's going  to be out anyway.  Um, but I'm not going to ask them to do that until, like, right before the special June 30th.  Wait, the whole open's going to be out there before the special?  No, part of it will be.  Just that one part of Ozzy.  But I fucking, I shot something with Ozzy, and, uh... 
[01:11:00]  It was great.  It was a Monday.  It was great.  I flew out on Sunday, I had emailed Sharon and said, would he do this?  It's a one-page script, and, uh, do you know how hard it was not to talk about this on the  fucking show?  Right.  Um, and she's like, well, he's overseas right now, he's taping the new record, um, so I told  her when I wanted to do it, and she's like, okay, just give us a time frame.  She's like, we'd be delighted.  I couldn't believe that they said yes to that.  So I get the date, um, they approve the script is fine, there's no change, it's so easy. 
[01:11:30]  They really are nice people, man.  And she's like, would you mind doing it at our house?  So I'm like, uh, yeah.  So she fucking says, okay, um, because they live about an hour outside of LA, 45 minutes  outside of LA.  So she gives me the address.  You just got the address to Ozzy's house?  They gave me the address to Ozzy's house.  Did they realize you were a stalker?  They had no idea.  I've been out there every day.  Just hanging out.  But she goes, uh, here's our address.  How weird is that?  You just, wow.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  I can't wrap my head around that.  Knowing how much of a fan you are.  Well, I was very, I was very specific.  You've got to slow down and walk me through this now.  Like, all right, you get the, you get Ozzy's address, right?  Yes.  Now, are you in a rental car or is someone driving out there?  No, I had, uh, I had the address before I went out there.  I was, because we had to give it to the production crew for the coordinating.  I mean, how did you get to his house?  From the first part of the shoot at the, at the London hotel, we, we took a ride out.  We finished in the morning.  What were you thinking?  No, I get, I get you did the first part.  Right.  So now you're in the car, you, you, you know where Ozzy lives and you're on your way. 
[01:12:30]  Are you just freaking the fuck out?  Well, we, he's a gated community.  So I'm like, okay.  My big thought was I called Tony that morning, his assistant, and he has bad reception.  So he called and left me the home number.  Give me Ozzy's home number.  So I called and asked for Tony.  And we coordinated me coming and he goes, you got to be on a list, um, you know, to  get into the gated community.  So my first thought was, okay, I hope everybody, cause there was like eight of us or six of  us, myself, the director, you know, camera, light guy, all necessary guys.  Uh, I said, I hope that we're all on this fucking list. 
[01:13:00]  And we were, and we get through, we're on our way to Ozzy's house.  And I felt overwhelmed, but also very confident.  Like I knew this was going to work.  Like I knew that they, because it was going through Sharon directly and Tony Dennis is  his, who's been his guy for 30 years, that there was no one that could fuck this up.  It was myself.  And I asked Sharon, there was the two people that I knew I had final say in what I was  doing.  And she had final say or Nazi, of course.  Right. 
[01:13:30]  But I mean, you know, she's his manager.  So all goes through Sharon.  So I knew it was going to be okay.  As long as we didn't fuck up anything on the production or shooting end.  So we pull up to his house and like, that's fucking where Ozzy lived.  Like that's where his real house.  Nice.  We massive, a massive, it's where Ozzy Osbourne should live.  Wow.  So I want to be respectful of the space.  So we pull up and again, there's a few cars.  So me and the director said, let's just walk up the two of us.  So we knock on the door and some guy, I guess he's a security guy, whatever, opens the door. 
[01:14:00]  Are you just losing your mind?  I'll tell you what I lost my mind.  When I walk in and I see this beautiful table and it's all of Ozzy's family photos, but they're  not things that you see on TMZ.  They're like real family pictures that you just have in your fucking house.  And there's a couple of different rooms we have to choose from to shoot what I want  to shoot.  It's all to get the shot I wanted to get.  I needed the room to be constructed a certain way.  None of the rooms were perfectly ideal, but we found the one that worked the best, which 
[01:14:30]  happens to be right next to Ozzy's personal workout area.  So I'm just sitting there in his workout area looking, again, pictures of his kids when  they're little, him and Jack and Amy and Kelly and Sharon outside of a tour, like just things  that you would take with your fucking family while you're on the road.  Wow.  And we had about 40 minutes until Ozzy would be ready because we were a little bit early,  which was fine.  We knew we would be.  And we're setting up the camera and I'm doing a couple of running tests. 
[01:15:00]  I wanted all to go smoothly.  I don't want Ozzy to be in there for fucking 45 minutes.  But when I walked in, I'm looking into this big basement.  I see all this gold records going down into this fucking, I'm like, that's just fucking  studio.  So a few minutes later, Tony goes, come in, man, come in the kitchen.  So I walk into the kitchen and I see fucking Ozzy sitting in a chair and it's a, you could  land a fucking 727 in this kitchen.  Sharon is doing his eye makeup because he's just getting a little bit of stuff.  And I see his people, Michael and Julie, who I've communicated with many times, they're 
[01:15:30]  like assistants of Ozzy and Sharon, they help us out.  And he's looking at my script, like Ozzy's holding my script.  And so I walk over and him and Sharon are going over it.  And, uh, I go, uh, I say, hello.  I go, thanks so much.  And Sharon's like, Oh, it's, it's, you know, you're welcome.  We're happy you're here.  And, um, so me and Ozzy just start rehearsing my script and it's like, he's holding what  I've written.  And I see the little Ozzy is highlighted like somebody like, like anybody else in the 
[01:16:00]  reading the script.  And we're just going over back and forth and we get it.  And, uh, we, we go into the next room and we're just making small talk about, uh, he's  like, Oh yeah, Jack's having his baby.  We're just chit chatting.  And then we do the fucking script and, uh, we probably shoot for 15 minutes.  It's all we needed.  20 minutes, maybe with the camera pullback.  And, uh, I mean, I'm the whole time I'm kind of overwhelmed on this close.  I'm fucking knee to knee with Ozzy shooting this.  So then afterwards he leaves and we, we says, God bless your man. 
[01:16:30]  We say goodbye and we're packing up the camera equipment.  And a minute later he goes, Jim, um, and he called me Jim.  I was so happy because Rob Zombie said that he'd never remember my name ever.  He said, I've been on tour with the guy.  He's don't remember.  So he comes in and he goes, uh, he goes, Jim, man, come here.  I want to play something for you.  So I fucking follow Ozzy down into his fucking, uh, personal recording studio.  And it's just me and him and his assistant is behind us on the sofa who hooks up the equipment. 
[01:17:00]  And he goes, I'm going to play a couple of the new tracks for you.  And I'm sitting, Ozzy plays me new black Sabbath.  I'm sitting there with Ozzy listening to unheard Sabbath in his fucking house.  And it was, it was really good.  And I couldn't have not liked it, but it genuinely was great.  And I'm sitting there and he listens to music the way we do.  He's fucking like, he's moving, like he's being Ozzy sitting in his seat and he's like,  keeps looking over at me. 
[01:17:30]  Is he looking for your approval?  Yes.  That's fucked up.  The way I would do it.  Like he's just looking to see if I'm enjoying the music.  And I really was.  Right.  And, um, I was actually getting the chorus and learning the chorus as we were going.  I think I was too, I almost ended it there.  I almost said, can I go home?  Like I got to, I can't do this.  It was too much.  But, uh, to be listening to Ozzy, all I'm thinking of is like, I wish my friends were here  to see this.  Like they, but it was a really, really cool, personal, intimate thing that he played for me.  And I knew he knew that it would mean a lot, but I think he also has, you know, 
[01:18:00]  as I'm a Sabbath freak and want to get my opinion on it.  Right.  And it was fucking, it was an amazing thing.  We listened to two tracks loud, fucking loud.  It's amazing that anybody in music has hearing left.  Right.  Um, but he's blasting it on this system.  And, uh, I told him it was great.  And I really, I asked him how tall he was.  Um, and, uh, you know, he said he's doing great and he's doing very well.  It's just the chemo is a little bit wearing on him.  So the, the, the second song ends and what is, what is his first words to you? 
[01:18:30]  Um, I just, I think my, I just, I don't remember.  I think I just started talking.  I'm like, dude, it's fucking great.  And then he stopped it and he's played me too.  And, um, well, if you talked first, you probably said, can I blow you?  Yeah.  Please.  Do you need a release?  It's not gay.  I just heard your new Sabbath.  It was so hard not to talk about that on the air because I literally got to sit.  The shoot was awesome.  And the fact that he did this was awesome.  Um, but again, they're going to Twitter it.  So the, the, the, it would be out before the special aired anyway. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  Um, all I really wanted was the live crowd surprise of seeing him in it.  And they gave it to me.  They were shocked.  Did you, um, did you see where he put the Beatles books while you were in the house?  I did not.  It's funny.  I thought of that too.  Like he has probably no recollection of that at all.  But, uh, I might have to retweet that video.  One of the greatest laughs I've had doing radio.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  It was the day that Ozzy left Jimmy's birthday presents behind.  Well, Jimmy's birthday presents to him behind. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  But it did this all make sense for it.  One of all these really nice Beatles books and he just left them on the counter.  He just literally walked me into his basement and played me two new Sabbath songs.  That's amazing.  It's fucking, the hardest thing to do is not call Florentine because Florentine, I know,  is such a Sabbath fanatic.  You should have just fucking dialed his number and just like, you know.  He knows now.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I died.  I didn't think to do any pictures or anything.  It's really weird.  Like, I don't do any more photos with him or any other stuff.  I mean, I have video.  But, uh, you don't think of that stuff in that moment. 
[01:20:00]  I just talked to him about sleep disorders a little bit after.  I mean, that was it.  I left.  I never want to overstay.  Like, you never want someone to invite you into their space and overstay.  So after he was done playing you the two tracks and you guys just walked up.  We walked up the house and he went back towards the kitchen.  We were just talking and I just went in and said thank you to, to, uh, to shower and  we said goodbye and I'll see you again.  And, um, and then I went in with the camera crew guys and Tony showed us on the way out  because they were already packed up.  God, you must've treated yourself.  No, I didn't need it all.  I was, uh, I was good because I knew I still had to film.  Right.  That was like a week or two, but I did probably 10 days radio with you guys after that. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  And I didn't say anything to anybody.  Nobody knew.  But Jonathan, were you surprised when you saw it?  Oh God, yeah.  You are right.  And the open is amazing.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I was, I was, uh, there are some huge laughs.  Yeah.  It was, uh, like it's perfect.  I can, I tell you, and I, and I honestly, I mean that when you deal with a network, you're  like, this is going to be a problem and blah, blah, blah.  Cause something in the opening is a little bit different than most standup comedy specials.  It's never been done in a standup special.  It's not the end of the world, but it's just, it hasn't been done. 
[01:21:00]  So the network was like, well, okay.  And then they went, I had a discussion with them and they were reasonable and they were like,  all right, you know what?  You're right.  Like epics.  And I'm not just blowing smoke.  It's the best network experience I've had because they, they, they are a network with  Viacom.  And so they run like a network, but they're all very, very approachable.  And they listen to you when you mentioned something to them, they take your genuinely  take your considerations, uh, your concerns into consideration.  And it's, I can't believe that they're still hungry.  They're still fucking hungry. 
[01:21:30]  They're still hungry.  Exactly.  That's the key to everything.  This place isn't hungry anymore.  So it's like, say no to everything.  Keep it all nice and safe.  Um, same with fucking CBS radio.  And when we were over there, they weren't hungry anymore.  These guys are fucking hungry.  They don't give a fuck if we fail or succeed at this point.  And I apologize to Bobby.  I know he's here and we were just going to talk about Ozzy for five minutes.  So I'm sorry, buddy.  No, we'll take a break.  We'll get Bob Kelly in here.  That's a, that's a great story.  Yeah.  Good behind the scenes stuff from the special too, because I wasn't sure you were going 
[01:22:00]  to talk about the meltdown.  Sure.  I'm glad you did.  I was not annoyed.  I, the guy, again, I really mean it.  The guys at New Wave were great and, and Epix people were great.  The people that I thought would be hard were the best.  The network and the production company.  It was just that little local.  Cause I think they didn't pay enough attention to detail because a lot of times the local  union guys don't give a shit.  And you fucking stepped up to the plate for that second show.  I was very happy with the second show and I'm very, very happy with the way the  specialists come out.  I can't believe I'm saying that.  If you knew the depression I was going through in my hotel room that night before, I knew  I didn't have the courage to hang myself, but I really, really thought about it. 
[01:22:30]  I just, but I know I'm a coward.  So it was just a dumb thought.  I was fiercely depressed.  All right.  Very good.  When does the special come out?  June 30th.  We're almost there.  If you don't have, that's why it was, I had to go to LA and edit.  We had pictures been locked already, as they say, and we had a week to do that.  But they don't, Epix is on every cable outlet except for like DirecTV, so you can get it  on epixhd.com.  They're really smart and it's very, very easy to see the special and I'll help you guys get 
[01:23:00]  to it when it's time.  All right.  Do you know about Square Sheep Clues?  I do not.  You do not.  Should we play this for them?  I'm meant to break.  Is it worth playing one more time?  Because we have a brand new cloud video too.  Brand new.  This is the third of the series that Danny's finding for us.  Danny came to the show last week with this guy who insists he could change the shape of  clowns by chanting to them.  I could do that.  I just keep looking at them. 
[01:23:30]  I go dissipate, dissipate, and they fucking do.  Here's the one that started it all.  It's called Square Sheep Clues and we got a brand new one, one called Cloud.  He makes a cloud completely disappear.  We'll play a little later in the show, but just so Jimmy can catch up one more time, here's  the Square Sheep Cloud Guy.  This is a weather control, psychic cloud control video by T-Chase.  See this cloud? 
[01:24:00]  I make videos where I'm able to control clouds by my psychokinesis, psychic power.  I'm making this in, uh, recording this September, 2010.  See this cloud?  I'm going to try to turn this cloud into a square-shaped cloud.  Make this cloud into a square-shaped cloud.  By psychic power, turn it into a square-shaped cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud. 
[01:24:30]  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Cloud.  Turn into a square shaped clowd 
[01:25:00]  Turn into a square shaped clowd  Clowd become a square shape clowd  Clowd become a square shaped clowd  Turn into a square-shaped cloud. 
[01:25:30]  See the clouds becoming more of a square-shaped cloud.  Clued, become a square-shaped cloud.  Sirius XM. 
[01:26:00]  It's the O.P. and Andrew Show.  All right, now I'm in here by myself.  Whatever.  Here comes Bob Kelly to save the day.  Where do you want me, over here?  Wherever you want to sit there, Bobby.  You're the big special guest.  Why don't you sit down?  Get yourself comfortable.  I see you got your Starbucks coffee in front of you.  You got a microphone in front of you? 
[01:26:30]  I know how these work.  I have my own little fucking podcast.  I know the effort that goes into setting this show up.  Sorry to make you wait.  Fuck off.  I'm sorry to make you wait.  I don't care anymore.  That shit used to bug me.  This show used to be fun.  I used to be excited to come in here.  You don't have to be here.  No, I'm very excited.  Go home.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm not excited anymore.  What?  I'm not excited.  I'm excited to see you.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Prove it.  I just did.  I dropped the gasser.  Oh.  No, I don't give a fuck. 
[01:27:00]  He pushes out excitement.  We're just a little behind because we want to talk about Jimmy's teeping.  Oh, yeah.  It was very weird to see you here.  I literally thought, where's Bobby?  I walked by.  I'm so used to seeing this seat.  No, I'm thinking Anthony.  The fart?  It's the fart and the Lysol from the microphone.  You're using the Pertussis microphone.  Yeah, by the way.  I was using the bad one.  I probably wouldn't have sat there today.  You know what?  Pertussis is a bad cough that Anthony has.  He's legitimately sick.  Come on, Sam. 
[01:27:30]  You're making everybody sick.  You might know it as the whooping cough.  Something you don't fuck around with.  And you were just using his microphone.  Didn't they eradicate that in the fucking 40s?  Supposedly, it's coming back because, I don't know, people aren't giving their kids as many shots or something.  I read that somewhere, so I don't know if that's true.  But he sent out an email late yesterday saying that he's not coming in, he can barely talk, and he might have Pertussis.  And we don't know if he's joking or not.  That's the problem.  Jimmy's the only one that thinks he's joking.  But my thought is, if you're joking, you wouldn't use a word that most people don't know. 
[01:28:00]  You didn't know what Pertussis was.  I didn't know he was coughing Friday, so I wasn't here, so I thought.  But then we got some guy who, I don't know, has gay sex with Bobo.  He says he has it, too, because he might have ran into Anthony.  So I don't know.  Oh, maybe he does.  Okay.  And he's going to the doctor.  Maybe he can call the show.  Because we're trying to figure out if Ant was fucking around with everybody, which would be hilarious,  because I got the whole place disinfected for everyone overnight.  I made people get out of bed and come in here to get this place disinfected. 
[01:28:30]  Well, I feel a cough starting.  So now if Ant comes in tomorrow and says, no, I was just making a joke.  It was just a bad cough.  I will laugh my balls off that I forced people to disinfect this place for nothing.  I love that you just breeze over some dude who's having gay sex with Bobo.  I don't know.  It's Bobo's boyfriend or something.  I don't know.  That's what Sam says.  By the way, somebody yelled out on the early show on my special.  It wasn't Bobo, right?  Somebody said it was Bobo.  Do you remember that moment?  But then I heard after it was not him.  Oh, I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  What do they yell out?  It's something about a birthday or whatever.  Kenny, don't use the Pertussis microphone, Kenny.  Don't do it.  You're going to kill the Pertussis.  Huh?  You're going to die sometimes.  Oh, God, that's sometimes, Red.  And that's Ronnie B's microphone.  Don't do it.  Does Ronnie B realize he might have used the Pertussis microphone?  I don't know.  We got problems.  No, he blew your first joke by yelling out happy birthday.  Who did?  It was two drunks in the first row of the balcony.  Right.  They were sitting right next to Bobo. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  So they had to be with Bobo.  No, they weren't.  They were.  They're this guy.  Did you kick them out?  It was the one guy that drove Bobo to Cleveland.  I heard they took a bus to Cleveland.  Well, however they got.  The guy that took Bobo to Cleveland, they were sitting next to those two drunks.  Okay.  And they were just two drunken idiots.  So why weren't they thrown out?  They were thrown out.  Okay.  The thing was, you know, you get one chance, you open your mouth the second time, you're  out.  Okay.  So when the guy opened his mouth, you know, the head of security, he went right up there. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay, good.  And he spoke to him.  And when he yelled out happy birthday again, I went up there to make sure they were throwing  him out.  Good.  And, you know, they were extremely fucking wasted.  Okay.  And they're trying to explain, like, look, you don't understand.  You're supposed to say that to Jimmy.  Yeah.  Not at a taping for a comedy special.  They don't know better.  So, like, the two security guys are walking him out.  Then a Cleveland cop came.  I hope they didn't get arrested. 
[01:30:30]  I mean, I just...  No, they didn't get arrested.  It was a nice, friendly cop that took care of him.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and walked him outside.  And they're just trying to explain, like...  They only kicked one of their testicles.  They didn't understand, like, you know, that's what you're supposed to do.  That's funny.  Nice cops work.  All right.  Fuck.  And believe me, I even had enough.  He tried to get a zinger.  He was like, well, that's a pretty good zinger.  I was just focusing on these dummies trying to explain.  No, that's what you're supposed to do. 
[01:31:00]  No, you're not.  You're supposed to shut your face and let Jimmy tell jokes.  We're big fans of the show.  You don't understand.  I go, do you know who I am?  And they go, no.  I go, then you're not big fans of the show.  Shut your mouth and get out.  Like, I had enough.  I'm just getting a big head in the studio.  Wow, Kenny.  You want everyone to know who you are?  Well, if they claim to be big fans...  What do you think?  You're a big shot of something?  Everyone's so tense today.  Everybody's very...  I hate shit.  I'm in very good spirits.  I just don't feel good.  Well, we're a little preoccupied.  We want to know what's going on with this pertussis. 
[01:31:30]  I'm not scared.  Where's my thing?  Did you bring my thing?  I forgot it.  That's fine.  No, I forgot.  I just woke up this morning and left.  I walked out the door.  Is it the whooping cough or is it the whopping cough?  Whooping.  Dr. Steve said whooping.  Well, you got the whooping cough.  I'm trying some zingers here, Bobby.  Help me out.  Hey, you're really fucking throwing some out there.  I thought there was something good there.  The whopping cough, which...  Give me a laugh before you said the joke.  I know, because I...  Yeah, you don't have a laugh before the joke.  Sorry.  That's 101.  Did you bring my bandolier?  I forgot everybody.  He left his... 
[01:32:00]  Oh, this son of a bitch.  He told me.  He told me he left it hanging so you would see it as soon as you got out.  No, he left it at the restaurant.  I forgot it.  He left it.  And Bob's like, dude, you put your bandolier on.  And he's yelling at me, so I'm putting it on the wrong way.  I'm putting it on, like, fucking left over right.  He goes...  And it's like, again, like Colin picked out what a bully he is to get...  You know, stupid...  No, dummy.  Put it on this way.  I might have to get a bandolier.  I got it.  It's my second one.  I had one, but I left it in Cleveland by mistake.  When I'm tooling around with my kid, kids need a lot of stuff. 
[01:32:30]  And I'm starting to think that I might need that bandolier.  Today, when you're going home, stop off at the...  I got it at the house.  Because I pack his pockets with everything I need.  But now I'm starting to think maybe that bandolier would be good for me.  Well, the guy who has the runner, R-U-N-N-U-R, go runner, he looked at Jimmy on the internet  and he immediately sent me a medium.  Yeah.  Because it's smaller.  I'm slight of frame.  You're slight of frame.  Yes, I am.  You have a small gait.  Yes, I am.  Did you see rats last night? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  I told him that that we fucking walk in the street.  I hate them.  Why?  I hate rats.  I love checking out rats.  I hate it.  I'm not brave enough to get too close, but I like checking them out.  Yeah, but they're like cats in New York City.  They're big.  It's not like a rat.  They're fucking big.  Yeah, it looks like a fucking cat running around.  And they have the...  You know what freaks me out?  It's not so much the rat as those satchels they have on their assholes.  Those little satchels of whatever the fuck that is.  I never noticed.  You ever see that in the back of a rat's asshole?  I don't know what it is either, but it just fucking grossed me out. 
[01:33:30]  That's because they shit out license plates and shit.  Their assholes are destroyed.  The stuff they ate.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  That was a good thing.  See, there you go.  You fucked up, because then you said that was a good one.  I laughed.  Because I'm not...  You know, I'm striking out a few...  No, but you had one.  That was good, right?  Yeah, but it's like you hit a home run, and then you stopped and didn't run the bases.  Well, I wanted to take a look around a little bit.  Yeah, but no, you fucking run the bases.  Because it doesn't matter how long it takes to run the bases at that point.  Run the bases before you go in the dugout.  Take your hat off. 
[01:34:00]  All right, fair enough.  Don't just fucking stand there.  I should have ran the fucking bases.  Ran the bases.  And then...  Yeah, I like getting...  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  You know, so I'm at the playground, and I see a rat.  I forgot about this.  And I forget that, like, this job is really fucked up, and you want to relate to people.  And I'm in the playground, my kid's playing, whatever, and you have to meet parents all  the fucking time.  And we see a rat.  And kind of off in the distance, no big fucking deal, right?  But that reminded me of the time we cooked rats on our show. 
[01:34:30]  So I chose to tell that story at the playground, thinking it would be a very normal story for  anyone to hear.  A hit?  That they were fucking horrified.  And then I'm like, oh yeah, I got a weird job.  Kathy, come over here.  He's telling the story about he cooked rats?  Oh, really?  You think they're going to like that?  And she goes, and people ate it?  It was the time we had the two chefs come in.  One was an amateur, one was Frenchie, the French chef.  And the French chef cooks up the city rat to the point where people went back for seconds.  Right.  And she goes, and people actually ate it?  I'm like, oh yeah, they even went back for seconds. 
[01:35:00]  She literally kind of took her kid and moved to the other side of the playground.  I'm like, oh yeah, I got a fucked up job.  You know what sucks is that they can Google you now.  They can meet you at the park with a nice guy, with your little cute kid.  Yeah, they Google me in my building.  Little Viking kid that you have.  Yeah.  Little kid, the kid who has three dragons.  They Google me in my building, so I go up the freight elevator to my apartment.  Because they fucking look down on me.  Well, they should. 
[01:35:30]  Why?  They should look down on all of us.  Why?  We entertain.  What we've done to make a buck.  Why?  They should look up to me.  They should look up to you?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, I'm entertaining people, and I'm good looking, with really nice eyes.  They only look up to you if you're on a ladder.  I fucking hate Chip.  You hate that, Bob?  Don't touch me, Chip.  I hate when Chip touches me.  I know.  I fucking hate him.  Your first problem is you acknowledge him.  Do what I do.  I didn't even hear him talk.  Yeah, but you're 20 feet away.  I didn't hear him talk.  He can nudge me, though.  I gotta talk louder.  Punch him in the face. 
[01:36:00]  I can't punch Chip.  You're not punching Jimmy, you're punching Chip.  I can't punch him in the face.  Oh, he punched me.  Punch Chip in the face.  Nobody punches me.  See?  I like angry Chip, though.  He's asking for it.  Punch him in the face.  But I like angry Chip, I like.  My mother wouldn't let nobody hit me.  Oh, my God.  I don't fucking hate him.  Shut up.  All right, no bandoliers.  That sucks.  I got yours at the house.  Yeah, what's in your bandolier?  A bunch of shit, I bet.  I love my bandolier.  You're gonna like your bandolier.  I got you a tan one to match your hair.  I might like it.  It's not a big...  To match your hair.  It's a nice... 
[01:36:30]  It's small, right?  Yours is...  Yours was giant.  No, yours is...  I got you...  Yeah, yours is smaller.  Medium?  Yeah, medium.  Does it go, like, shirt size?  Because I'm now a large.  Yeah, you're...  I got you, too.  I got all...  I got you...  I got Jimmy, too.  Well, he lost.  He forgot his in Cleveland.  He doesn't...  Fucking...  You didn't forget it.  You left it in the hotel.  No, I didn't.  Some fucking Mexican maid wearing it around the fucking hotel now.  Exactly.  He's putting bullets in...  This is good.  Look at that.  Put my cigarettes right here.  Why didn't you take the bandolier with you now?  It was just so hectic packing to Los Angeles from Cleveland. 
[01:37:00]  And then I realized I was gonna be there all week, which was not supposed to be.  Yeah, but the bandolier would have came in handy.  Walking around the city of Cleveland?  Yeah, you have your shit everywhere.  You have a phone.  I know, boom-dum.  Boom-dum.  You don't need to walk around with anything in Cleveland.  Exactly.  You don't like Cleveland?  I like the people.  I can't explain Cleveland.  I don't...  I'm confused by it, but I think we always go there and just stay in the city and hotels  that are mediocre at best. 
[01:37:30]  I hear the suburbs are nice.  I hear parts of the city itself are nice, but, you know...  They have that one street, that one little street.  Cleveland Road?  No.  Fourth...  What is it?  Fourth Street?  They redid.  Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.  Near the House of Blues, right?  Yeah, I like that area town.  I went to dinner on Saturday night with our old friend Tyson Walter, who used to be in  the NFL.  Right.  I like to brag for him because I think he likes that, too.  And I liked it.  I'm like, fuck, why didn't we discover this street when we first got to Cleveland?  They got good restaurants over there.  That's a couple blocks, I think. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, how long did he play with Dallas?  I'm sorry, Bobby.  How long did he play with...  He used to be in alignment for Dallas.  He played a few years, right?  Yeah.  He ended up in Green Bay, but he didn't play much for them.  Okay.  But Dallas, that's when we were off the air.  So you're talking eight, nine years ago.  Eight years ago, let's say.  How many years did he play?  He did...  He was with Dallas, 2002, 2004.  And then Houston, 2005.  Redskins, 2006.  Packers.  Oh, so he played, like, what, six years in the NFL? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  He was a center.  I love that Sam reads that like he knows it.  He's just reading Wikipedia.  I told him to learn sports.  Yeah, he's reading it off of his head.  You got any good sports facts?  I didn't read it.  Yeah, you did.  It's right there.  Well, I just gave you all the Tyson Walter stuff off the top of my head.  You got any good sports facts from the weekend?  Kentucky Derby?  Anything?  Why?  There was that murder at the Kentucky Derby?  There was?  You hear about that?  Fuck no.  A guy's body was found in the stables.  Wow.  Like, near where the winning horse...  What was that about?  I don't know.  Was he fucked to death? 
[01:39:00]  I don't think the horse did it.  What?  Guys get fucked by horses, Bobby.  It's something that happens.  Relax.  Not at the Kentucky Derby.  Why not?  They're just horses in the end.  Yeah.  Get the fuck they can run fast.  Fuck an asshole.  You can't...  You can't...  I love Angry Chip.  Why would you...  He hates you.  Why would you invest so much time and effort into a race that's a couple minutes long once  a year?  I thought you were going to say, why do you invest so much money on an expensive horse  if you can't fuck it?  Well, that's true, Bobby.  Or at least suck its dick, right?  What? 
[01:39:30]  That's true, Bobby.  He should be at least able to cup its balls.  Yeah, at least take a load out of it in your mouth or something.  What?  To suck its big cock.  The horses have balls?  Would you jerk off a horse?  Excuse me?  If someone said, look, this is completely not gay.  We're going to give you a pass.  It's not gay.  Would you jerk off a horse?  Is a horse cock gay, though?  No.  No, it's hot.  I mean, it's so big, isn't it?  I don't know.  If you just admire it.  I don't know.  Would you?  What would I be jerking it off for?  For shits and giggles?  For lunch.  Yeah, for a life experience. 
[01:40:00]  No, there has to be a reason.  What's the reason?  The life experience isn't a reason.  To just say, I'm just waiting for this.  There's going to be a bad one.  You're just farting in front of him?  Do you know how excited he is right now?  Yeah, he's very excited.  I'm trying to breathe in my mouth.  This is through my mouth and out my mouth.  It's actually not bad as I hoped.  This is chill Jim.  No, not bad.  He's very chill.  Last time I saw Jimmy, which was 10 days ago, it looked like he was going to murder everybody.  And now he's just looking at me.  What, the anxiety of filming your show? 
[01:40:30]  No, the fuck up that happened.  The lighting fuck up drove me.  It was the biggest meltdown I've ever had.  But I was right to be upset.  Was that the biggest one you ever had?  Yes, because the magnitude of...  I freaked out after Monster Rain's first show, too, because they did what I told them.  Holy fuck.  Just hit me over here.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, there it is.  Really?  I didn't get any of it.  Are you serious?  Bob's got a big rod right now.  I didn't get...  No, I don't.  A wall of Lysol.  But after the first show of Monster Rain, they had sat too many good-looking people up front.  These were all sold tickets.  Monster Rain wasn't.  And I said, I don't want to see fucking cute Asian girls in the front row. 
[01:41:00]  I mean, if they're fans, fine, but they're not.  They're just people that came for a taping.  This was different.  The seating here was not an issue.  But I went fucking ballistic.  I'm like, do not seat my fucking late show like that.  I want it to look like a fucking Jim Norton show.  It's important.  Why would they seat little cute little Asian girls?  The Monster Rain taping.  Because the audience coordinator was good, but they just do that to make it look like  a bunch of...  You know, that's what they do for TV.  Yeah.  Sure.  Which is exhausting to watch.  I've been so tired by the time the taping actually starts because they look at the audience 
[01:41:30]  ad nauseum and moving people around.  It's like no one gives a fuck to that level.  Just start the fucking show.  People are falling asleep.  They're tired now.  Right.  I have sat in the Comedy Central audience for some of these tapings.  I'm not joking.  Over an hour sitting there as they stare at the audience, go, no, we got to move that  person.  Do they really do that shit?  Dude, it's ridiculous.  I'm glad you're bringing it up.  Sickening.  I understand if you do a quick little shuffle here and there, but they study it. 
[01:42:00]  You see, they put their hand on their chin from the stage and they're looking at cameras  back, you know, the monitors backstage and then they're moving.  They're, they're splitting up couples.  So now it looks like you're cheating on your fucking wife because you're with somebody else  now.  And they, and they don't even use, uh, it's not even real too.  Cause a lot of them, they don't even use the laughs.  They use the audience coordinator going, laugh, laugh.  No, no.  They use like my show.  You do a double taping.  So there's a guy before me and then I go up and did my half hour.  He did his half hour.  He fucking bombed, but they just used my laughs. 
[01:42:30]  They just used the me, the crowd laughing at me and they threw it in his special.  What?  To the other guy's special?  No.  So everything evens out.  So if you kill, you do good.  If you suck, you do good.  I fucking, uh, gets a trophy.  Yeah.  They can't, well, they, yeah, because they can't, they can't show somebody sucking like,  um, you know, Mitch Hedberg, his first special on, uh, comedy central.  So he bombed.  That's why he's sitting down on the stairs.  He's literally fucking bombing.  Yeah.  Cause people didn't understand him yet.  They just added laughs to it.  Like he was killing. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  And the people were like, Oh my God, this is the funniest thing ever.  Yeah.  Huh?  Uh, I went to your taping, Bobby.  Yeah.  I supported you.  You do remember that, right?  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  Good.  We actually had the first.  What do you want to fucking metal?  What's wrong with you?  We had the first three rows added.  It's done for me.  I don't even get a bandolier.  Dude, you get one.  You get one.  You said that like I'm taking over the world tomorrow.  Like you remember that, Bobby, right?  Like the new mob boss.  Sometimes giving away.  We had, because there was a big space between the front row and the stage, just the way the 
[01:43:30]  theater was constructed.  Right.  So we put in three extra rows just so it was closer to the audience.  Wow, really?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, that was just a theater, physically a seating issue.  So we do it.  I heard Billy Joel would do it.  I just stole it from him.  Go to the back row, get people, or the last row.  Dane used to do that.  Dane used to do that.  I didn't hear about it from Dane.  I heard about it from Billy Joel.  I told you that, though.  No, you didn't.  And my agent, who's Billy Joel's agent, told me about Billy Joel doing that.  Now, you're saying that Dane told you.  But I told you that.  My agent wouldn't speak to you.  You guys want to learn more about Ant's illness through Kurt Love?  Oh, boy. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, boy.  This cough's going to be bad.  I can feel it.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  If there's pertussis going around, we got issues, man.  Big issues.  Yo, that's my sister.  We got big issues.  Yo, pertussis.  Call me up.  What you making all that noise for?  Oh, oh, oh.  Yo, we're pertussis.  Yo, she out with whooping and shit.  I could shut down production of this show for a long time.  Yeah.  If this is a real issue.  So he's getting married.  He can't have the... 
[01:44:30]  I can't have pertussis.  He can't have the whooping cough as he's trying to fucking get married.  Did you get a hotel for Sam's wedding?  I'm not invited.  I didn't get invited.  Oh, my brother wants to know where his invite is.  Why?  I didn't invite any comedians.  I just invited people on the show.  I didn't think anybody would want to come.  Oh, okay.  No, that's fair enough.  No, I think it's fair.  He didn't want you there.  I'm fine with that.  My brother wants to go, though, Sam.  Your brother?  You got some extra spots?  Yeah.  I only hang out with your brother at your family fun.  Exactly.  But if all of a sudden, like, you got a couple empty seats, why not, you know, add my brother?  Yeah, you want to fill in some fans? 
[01:45:00]  If someone says they want to go, you let them go.  He's really good at weddings.  You don't question it.  He's a real good wedding guest.  Is he going to bring, like, money?  He's pretty poor.  I pay for everything.  Will you give him money to give to us?  Sure.  On top of whatever you're giving us?  No, he's just going to make his gift less and divvy it up in two.  That's what I don't want.  From Opie and brother.  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.  I don't want that.  I don't have a date.  I have no one to bring to Sam's wedding.  Bring Bobby!  I'm not going to your wedding with Norton.  Why not?  Because.  It'll be fun.  You guys can dance.  Have some laughs. 
[01:45:30]  Kurt Love.  Sorry, Kurt.  That we didn't get to you in time.  Yeah, we got to.  Don't mean to keep you waiting.  We're talking about Sam's wedding.  It was either him exasperated or him fucking Bobo.  You hear that?  That's what you get to hear from these assholes.  I don't want to issue Pete.  What?  Kurt.  Nah, he's not paying attention.  Hello.  He's taking it for granted.  Yeah, okay, Kurt.  Fine.  What do you got?  See, why don't you call yourself Kurt Hater something?  Good morning, guys.  There's rumors that you have sex with Bobo.  Let's get that out of the way.  Is that true or false? 
[01:46:00]  He's dead, Obi.  He's been dead since before Christmas.  You know that.  How would I know that?  Remember that?  You saw the video.  The fake Bobo dead thing that we did for a week?  I don't remember that.  You don't?  No.  We do a million bits a day.  Yeah.  I like how.  All right, well, I'm sorry.  Guys, I went out to visit Anthony.  Oh, he fucking hung up.  Did I hang up, Kurt?  Oh, there he is.  Get a hold of yourself.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Um, I went to show Ant some kittens this week.  I had to bring some kittens out to somebody on the island. 
[01:46:30]  And, uh, he was coughing up a storm.  His voice was shot.  And, uh, I think I came down with it, too.  You think you have what?  Um, I'm going to the doctor after lunch today.  I've been sick, headaches, sinuses, and coughing like crazy since, I think, Wednesday.  Since you showed Ant the kittens.  So now you're claiming that Anthony gave you pertussis.  Yeah, he definitely.  We were playing with the kittens together and, you know, just hanging out with the kittens. 
[01:47:00]  Why, the kittens had it?  There can only be so much sickness.  Every single person gets it.  It's like each tussis gets one.  You have to get one pertussis.  Is that your fault or the cough?  Yeah, the cough is not good.  You sound sick.  Give us a good cough.  I want to hear what this pertussis sounds like.  That's fake.  That's fake.  It's fake.  That sounds fake. 
[01:47:30]  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  All right.  I've been pretty much bedridden for the last two or three days.  Oh.  It sounded like just, did you just side saddle?  Bedridden.  It sounds like Voss acting coughing.  No, it's not acting coughing at all.  It's really, it sucks, dude.  And Ed didn't look good last week.  He's probably getting worse.  And hopefully he does get it taken care of.  What happened to the fucking Bobo? 
[01:48:00]  Is this a good...  No, no.  This guy supposedly has sex with Bobo.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  I was right there.  Bobo's dead.  There's rumors they have gay sex and stuff.  I wasn't there either when I had sex with him, apparently.  Did you have sex with Bobo?  Absolutely not.  He's had.  There you go.  He's on record saying he has.  Why are you saying no, Sam?  Well, because, I mean, they've had a relationship with Bobo.  Yes, there's definitely a relationship.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:48:30]  I love the people that want in with the show by hanging out with Bobo and doing special things  for Bobo, thinking that's what's going to bring them into the inner circle.  It's obvious.  It's not to get into the show, OB.  It's just because she lives four blocks away from me.  Intern Matt used to do that, try to be friends with Bobo with him.  I like Intern Matt.  What?  Just because it pisses off everybody there.  I like him.  I like Matt, too, actually.  I like Matt as well.  I've always liked Matt.  I was on the record saying I like Matt.  I got my job and everything.  I know you did.  Him and Wheeze are probably good for each other, though. 
[01:49:00]  You know how many interns you pissed off by giving him?  Yeah.  I know it drives people nuts.  That's why I do things.  That's why I do some of my things.  Can we fix...  All right, Kerloff, thanks.  You got it.  I'll take care, boys.  Stop.  OB, can we fix Sam's eyebrows?  I would love to trim them all the eyebrows.  Can we get the Indian ladies who do that rope?  Oh, you should fucking do that fucking...  What do they call it?  Stringing?  Stringing.  Threading.  Threading.  What do they thread?  Let's thread your eyebrows.  Don't thread anybody because it's just not nice. 
[01:49:30]  Is that a bad one?  I don't know how they thread.  And they do it really fast at the malls.  Really fast.  Can we get somebody in here to just take care of those before your wedding?  What is threading?  What is it?  They just use thread and they trim your eyebrows.  Why can't you do it with tweezers?  It's got tweezers.  Threading is better.  Why is threading better?  I don't know.  It just looks...  Wow, your eyebrows look pretty shapely there, Bobby.  I've never done it.  You threading, motherfucker.  I never did it.  You threading, bitch.  Swear to God.  Under here a little bit.  No, you can see. 
[01:50:00]  You can see.  Yeah.  You bitch range, shit.  Stop threading.  Are you threading?  No.  You're threading.  Motherfucker.  Norton's eyebrows fucking are dying.  They're all crazy.  They really do look unwatered.  Threading is...  I don't know.  I hate...  I hate perfect eyebrows.  They're creepy.  Yeah.  How is your two million views on the eyebrow threading?  Are you humiliating this for all of us?  No kidding, man.  Look at that.  Watch.  Did I say same direction again?  She's kind of pretty.  She's very pretty.  I meant to say opposite direction. 
[01:50:30]  So you want to group the hair in the opposite direction that it goes in.  And then what do you do?  I don't get it.  There's a threading shop opening up in our neighborhood, Jimmy.  You guys get threaded.  That business is going to be a bust.  I don't know about that.  A lot of broads go to that.  No, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  No, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  No.  Why are they threading?  They do.  No, they don't.  Yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  Are they threading because they don't want to pluck?  Yeah, I love being a child. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Shut up.  It's cute when you're off.  Can we thread your eyebrows, Sam?  No.  Why?  I'm not going to do anything to my eyebrows before my wedding.  Are you going to do anything special for your wedding?  Yeah, I'm going to show up.  I got a facial.  I made sure I was clean shaven.  I had a really short haircut.  I got a hand job.  Showed a little respect.  You got a hand job for your wedding?  Yeah, from a man.  That's none of your business.  Sam, what are you going to do?  Are you going to groom a little bit?  I'll shave.  I'll take a shower.  And I'll clean up the back of my neck. 
[01:51:30]  How about you cut your hair?  With what?  Guillotine?  No, not really cute.  Are you going ponytail, or are you going to make it all wild and shit?  Yeah, I'll wear it just like this.  That's how I wear it every day.  I mean, I'm going to look how I look.  Are you going to put like a black-tied ponytail in it or something?  No.  I'm going to look like this.  Why wouldn't you do something special for your wedding?  I hope you cry at your wedding.  I'm not going to.  You might.  You will.  You will.  I didn't think I...  Dude, I cried.  My wife actually...  Yeah, but you're a very emotional guy.  She should have cried.  My wife...  She didn't cry at all. 
[01:52:00]  Which bugged me.  She was in shock.  Yeah, she probably just resigned herself to the fact that this is what I'm doing.  She probably said fuck a lot.  I want to do the throne of David Rose dance.  His wife does a great Game of Thrones dance, which I picked up on.  What is it?  Do you have the game?  You need the music.  You have the Game of Thrones music.  It's a great theme song.  I hate it.  It's the worst.  Really?  It's the worst dance ever.  Oh, the dance.  The dance is just fucking spine bending.  There's an actual dance for it?  Yeah.  From where?  His wife invented it, but I picked up on it, and I'm very good at it. 
[01:52:30]  No.  I can't hear it, Opie.  I don't know what to do.  Turn it up.  You didn't put your headphones on or something.  What is he doing?  Bobby, what is he doing?  He's doing the Game of Thrones.  I can't watch.  What is he doing?  He's doing the Game of Thrones dance.  Do you like my double step?  Is this an actual dance?  Who made this up?  It's like a music box.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  I couldn't figure it out.  You don't like it?  I fucking hate it.  It's like you were doing some ballroom dancing. 
[01:53:00]  You don't like that song, though?  It's a great tune.  Yeah, it's very cool.  Ba-da-da.  The show's un-fucking-believable.  It aggravates me, that show.  As soon as it ends, you're like, fuck.  I'm two fucking episodes off.  I gotta watch.  I don't want to stop watching it until you just watch it all in one night.  Because every week, you're like, fuck, just show those stupid dragons.  A little marathon.  Just show the fucking bitch with the dragons.  They're all flying around or something.  They got, like, breathing smoke.  I used to have a dragon.  My prick was dragon all over your fucking mouth, cocksucker. 
[01:53:30]  Angry chip.  What the fuck?  He just shot him with two guns.  Whoa.  I'm a big fan of Game of Thrones.  Are you?  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  What a fucking twat.  Are you?  That's the worst.  I like the sex scenes.  You don't like Game of Thrones?  I don't know what's going on.  I do know, and it's confusing.  I end up watching it when I go to Philly, because they watch it a lot.  So then I'm sitting down, and I'm like, wow, look at these sex scenes.  But I don't know what's going on.  Well, fuck the sex scenes.  But then when, you know, then everyone gets into it because of the sex scenes, and then 
[01:54:00]  I heard they had a gay sex scene, like, last week or something.  Yeah, those are good, too.  I mean...  That was really hot when the fucking sister was like, she's...  Wait, I saw the...  You saw that one?  I saw the brother and sister going at it, and then the kid was in, like, climbed up, and  he was outside the castle window or whatever the fuck.  That was season one, yeah.  That was hot.  What do you mean that was season one?  Season one.  Season two.  That was season one.  Where the fuck are we now?  Season two.  Oh.  How do I get season one?  You fucking... 
[01:54:30]  On demand.  Go on demand.  Let's do that.  Well, you just come out of a fucking time capsule?  Yeah, kinda.  Really?  I've been busy the last two years with a kid.  You don't know how to fucking...  You think I could actually watch shows?  Sure, at night.  Are you serious?  Let me ask you a question.  Honestly, God, is your fucking day really consumed that much with a kid, so you can't  watch a show or a series?  I'd rather be outside at that point.  What do you mean?  I gotta be outside.  I can't be inside if it's still light out.  What?  Why?  Because I like being outside.  Obi goes out and plays until the streetlights come on. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  That really is.  He's a seventh grader.  He wants to be out in three years.  If it's really nice out, I can't just sit there and watch a show when I know I can  be outside.  So you go outside with your kid if it's nice out?  For the day.  Until it's dark.  Yeah.  So that's till like 8 o'clock now, 7 o'clock.  It also comes from growing up in a place where you want to completely be away from the  craziness, so you learn to stay outside.  Well, that's coming from when you were a kid, when you stayed inside all day.  No.  He never stayed inside.  He didn't want to be outside.  That's where the scary shit was.  Yeah, that's where the desire...  I stayed out. 
[01:55:30]  That's where he picked up his wand and went...  No way.  I had a brother that stayed in his room and kept everything dark.  I used to do that.  You were that guy.  I had a little spot in the basement I used to curl up in.  Really?  What's that about?  A little butterball.  I was in a depression for like two, three weeks.  I didn't go to school.  I would just go out front, go into the basement and sleep all day.  Really?  Yeah.  No, I have to be outside.  And then I'm tuckered out by the time it's dark and I come home. 
[01:56:00]  Then I'm tuckered out.  I don't really...  Now.  Yeah, then I'm like...  And then there's playoff hockey and stuff on.  Your kid must secretly hate you.  Why?  He loves me.  Because he's like...  He loves me.  He's going to love me.  You have to keep him out all day.  He's like, oh, he's going to go home and watch TV.  The kid probably goes, you know, we're in a multi-million dollar apartment, Dad.  How about we fucking chill out?  I would love to fucking just be home.  I can't just sit around.  Asshole has me at a park feeding pigeons.  I can't sit around and watch TV shows during the day.  I don't have to be outside.  Give yourself an hour or two. 
[01:56:30]  Opie's kid.  Angry.  That's what he's doing.  Just...  All right.  I don't want another fucking popsicle.  Take me home.  I get it.  I saw a raccoon at the park the other day.  Yeah, he probably hates that, too.  He was pretty impressive.  That could be your kid's voice.  Do you sleep well?  Because I'm surprised you're not tired during the day.  Like, I'm tired during the day.  I take a little nap.  Oh, you do?  A little bit.  Not too much, though.  45 minutes to an hour.  It's perfect.  It is, right?  Yes, and then I'm good.  I force myself to get up.  What time do you go to bed?  Nine o'clock?  No, it's more like 10, 10.30 these days.  10.30. 
[01:57:00]  I finally said, once you relax, you can still do a radio show with six hours sleep.  I used to fucking panic starting at nine.  Go to bed.  Go to bed.  And then I'd lay there because I'm panicking that I have to fall asleep right away.  Do you need to know this?  I like it.  Yeah, I do like to know that.  Because I don't do the show a lot, but when I do it, I was up to...  I was up until three o'clock last night because I can't go to bed because I'm sitting there  going to go to bed, go to bed, go to bed.  Do you eat any more of those Weight Watchers things at all?  No, I just had one.  They're good, right?  Yeah.  They're not bad.  Jimmy had an intervention with me last night.  I'm starting to.  Bob's going to. 
[01:57:30]  You better.  I'm starting to.  We had a nice chat.  You got my text.  See, people think I'm an asshole, but you got my text, right?  Yeah.  I got a treadmill coming.  We had a nice little moment in the text thing.  Yeah.  I'm not supposed to bring it up, though, right?  You should just let it happen.  Let's see.  There, you ruined it again.  I ruined it again.  What are you saying?  You just...  I just desperately want people to know I'm also a nice guy.  We know that.  I've said that.  I just desperately need people to know that now.  No, no, no.  Let's try it.  What is that?  Belly button?  I don't want to.  Because I didn't eat yet, and I'll throw up bile, and I'll hurt my throat.  Belly button? 
[01:58:00]  No, but it's not...  Dude, your belly button is...  Are you fucking...  Your acting stinks when you get paid for it.  Never mind just fucking around.  No.  Come on.  I didn't eat yet.  I gave you a buck.  No, let me eat first.  I don't want to...  If I puke up bile, I'll hurt my throat.  Want to smell my food pocket?  You have a what?  Food pocket.  What's a food pocket?  It's a phenomenon.  It happens.  I don't want a boss to be in the room so much.  You have a filling?  If he said that line, he'd have ten of them.  Whatever is in your shirt. 
[01:58:30]  Do you know how fucking...  Boss would have had a gem right there.  What are you talking about, boss?  No, but I mean...  What's a food pocket?  That's his setup.  For 900 jokes?  Of course.  Yeah, that's a boss setup completely.  Food pockets are a nightmare.  I have one.  Because you're filling?  No, it's not a filling thing.  It's in between the teeth.  It's more of a pocket where the food kind of...  You can get that filled up.  Get it filled up.  Well, I closed the gap a little bit, but I still get some smells coming from that area. 
[01:59:00]  Pull a fucking piece of meat out of there.  Sometimes.  Hunk of meat.  I've got to floss my ass off.  Oh.  Yeah.  You want to smell it?  No.  It's not acting up, though.  You can fill it in, dude.  You can fill it in a food pocket.  How do you fry them?  Yeah, fill it in with roast beef.  No, that's not good, Bobby.  It's going to stink.  Roast beef.  Do you have some right now?  Huh?  What do you get right now?  Nothing.  And I ate shrimp yesterday, too.  Really?  Usually that fucking collects in there.  Oof.  Oof.  I was at a communion yesterday.  Oh, they suck. 
[01:59:30]  For who?  Family?  I'm creeped out by...  God, I would never do that.  You don't do family stuff?  No!  Occasionally.  I go to family stuff because I want to see my family.  Oof.  The event itself is a little strange.  I love my family, but I just...  I love how, like, you know, organized religion and...  It's a cult.  I was at this church.  Creeped out yesterday.  Everyone chanting.  And the church I was at, they all had to raise their one hand, almost like Hitler.  Was it the Church of Anthony? 
[02:00:00]  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  It was weird.  Why would you raise your hand?  I've never heard of that.  I don't know.  I've never heard of it either.  It was a Catholic church.  You raise your arm up, like, fucking saluting Hitler?  They were raising it toward the kids that were getting their first communion.  Yeah, it's just the place.  And it was a regular mass, but they incorporated the first communion of these ten kids.  Are you getting your kid a communion?  I'll do the basics with him.  Are you going to let him decide?  Yeah, man.  Just in case there might be something.  I don't want to fuck up.  They have to go to class, though.  You can't just...  I don't want to fuck up his eternity just in case there is something. 
[02:00:30]  So I'll give him the basics and he'll figure it out.  You've got to watch that shit, though, man.  There's not so many creeps in the church.  And then he'll figure it out.  But that's a scary place, though, where you can't watch out for him.  Well, here's the deal.  You can't get married in a church if you didn't get your communion and...  What's the other one, too?  Confirmation, bitch.  You also can't get married in a church if you had a couple have sex in a church.  True that.  True that.  Motherfucker.  You couldn't get married in a church.  I just...  That was a joke.  You have to have your...  Well, I got married in a church.  You did get married in a church.  I got married in the Sixth Sense Church.  It was a good church.  It was a very nice ceremony. 
[02:01:00]  I would have to say it's probably the best wedding I've ever been to.  Yeah.  It better be.  It costs you a lot, right?  Nolan had a great wedding, too, though.  You and Nolan had the two best weddings.  I don't know.  Was it more than 50 grand?  Oh, God.  Really?  I don't know how much wedding's going on.  Oh, my God.  I'll never know.  I'll never know unless they allow my type of...  I mean, you know.  Will yours be more than 50, Sam?  You might want to multiply that number.  Yeah.  I think mine might get...  I don't think mine will be 50, but it'll probably be... 
[02:01:30]  What?  Like, his was way more than 50.  What the fuck?  Are you having a reception?  What's wrong with you?  That's a big night, though, Fred.  It's the start of your life.  More than 100?  You know.  Yeah.  Shit.  You never know.  Wow.  I think I ate more than $100,000 worth of candy in that little fucking area.  Where the fuck did you get married?  In a palace?  It's a nice church.  Pretty much.  Did you get pissed if people didn't use the things that you had?  Like, if...  What do you mean used?  Like, when you put out pretzels, if people didn't eat all the pretzels because you paid  for them? 
[02:02:00]  No, I don't give a fuck.  What did you give us gifts at the table?  Oh, you're a chiseler.  That's why.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I gave a good amount of money.  I don't remember.  Flowers.  I hate when they give out those candy-covered almonds in a mesh bag at wedding.  Oh, no.  I fucking hate those.  Fuck yeah.  I had an entire candy table.  What do you mean, a candy table?  Entire candy table.  Dude, he had a candy area outside.  That was probably a 20-foot table.  It was bigger than this console. 
[02:02:30]  You could imagine.  With delicious treats and bags of candy.  Everything.  But candy, like M&M's or everything.  Every candy you could imagine from your childhood.  It looked like the candy store.  Why?  What?  I mean, that's...  Because I'm a nice guy in the end.  You're not a nice guy.  I'm a nice guy.  You're not a nice guy.  You're not a nice guy.  I'm a nice guy.  I need people to know that now.  You're not a nice guy.  I'm moving to the next phase of my career.  You're not a nice guy.  I'm a nice guy.  You're not a nice guy.  A table of candy doesn't fucking...  Exactly.  Jolly Gacy had candy. 
[02:03:00]  How about hiring babysitters for everybody?  What?  I had a babysitting room.  That's true.  With a wee and everything in it.  Yeah, it was really nice.  That doesn't do anything.  Couches, and they had their own shit in there.  I did it for free.  They had their own shit,  so they didn't have to bother the parents.  E-Rock had a candy table at his wedding.  What did you have for food?  Did he?  How about Chaz Palmitari was so impressed  he came into my wedding to say hey?  He did.  I saw it.  Oh, was he there or no?  I don't remember.  No, he didn't.  He did.  He was a swear to God.  He went into the reception. 
[02:03:30]  Didn't you get married in Philly?  Yeah, he was down there doing his thing,  and he was like,  what the fuck is this thing?  Did he know us by then?  And he came in,  and then he saw us me,  and we just happened to interview him,  so he did remember.  Right.  And he came up,  and he was beyond cool.  So he just walked in  because he saw a cool party?  Yeah.  He wanted to check it out.  It's kind of fucking lonely.  It was just a coincidence that...  The other fucking lonely douchebag Chaz is.  It was a coincidence  that it was my wedding,  and then he came up to me  and said,  hey, man.  You think Chaz would be like,  fuck that. 
[02:04:00]  He probably had like chicks.  I got my own parties to go to.  Yeah, you think he'd be  fucking Dean Martin  up in his room  with a couple broads  and a tumbler?  Bobby, you would have known,  but I think you said no to my wedding.  You said no?  No.  Why didn't you go?  The wedding of the century.  What the fuck, Bob?  What the fuck?  I had a fucking...  What, you missed out on?  Did I ever tell you  I got jerked off  in between the wedding  and the reception?  My wedding?  Yeah.  By whom?  It's a massage drill.  Nice.  In the hotel.  Were you in the same hotel as me?  Yeah.  That's a nice hotel.  Whatever it was, yeah.  Ritz, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Ritz down there in Philly.  I love that he can take it...  You got jerked off?  Yeah.  By the hotel?  No, I had a chick meet me there  during the...  After the ceremony,  while you were taking family photos,  I was having cum yanked at me.  I love that he can't connect  to the fucking actual moment  of his friend getting married.  That's how he connects.  He can just fucking disconnect  by having a chick jerk off.  No, no, no.  I was depressed about something.  I don't want to get into it.  Ah, shit.  No, Jimmy was beyond cool.  Yes.  I was very generous.  Yeah, you were, man.  You didn't have to do that. 
[02:05:00]  Just kidding.  What'd you give him, 200?  Fuck that shit, man.  I gave you $35.  That's 25 plus 10, biatch.  I got some of the money back.  I gave you some money.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  You gave me a gift certificate  for a fine Italian restaurant.  No, not Italian.  You didn't even fucking know what it is  and you never used it.  I never would.  Of course you did.  Did you really not use it?  Well, I forgot.  How do you forget?  Can I have another one?  Yeah.  Actually, that actually...  I'm serious.  It renews itself after fucking five years.  So where is it?  How long have you been married? 
[02:05:30]  Three and a half, I think.  Yeah, it means three and a half years  you haven't fucking used the gift certificate.  No, I forgot about it.  That's why I don't go to weddings.  It's a waste of fucking gifts.  It's a waste of gift certificates.  Spend this money here.  I don't want to do it for a wedding.  Todd Barry has a very funny bit of gift certificates,  so I won't do it,  but I will say that you should just give them cash  so they can buy what they want.  They got to...  What the fuck is he going to want?  What are you going to do with a hundred bucks?  Pay back everything.  A hundred bucks?  A hundred bucks?  A hundred bucks?  What's wrong with you?  A hundred bucks.  Cheapskate. 
[02:06:00]  What, are you going to a wedding in 1980?  I didn't go to the wedding.  Whose wedding is it?  Fucking William Macy and Nina Barley?  I don't even know how much it is.  I gave him a gift certificate and I didn't go.  That's very nice of you.  Okay, you know what I got from my friends?  You know what Norton gave me to my wedding?  Awkward.  Nothing.  Oh, you know why?  Because we didn't...  Nothing.  He's got a year, though.  Because we thought we were watching a TV show.  But I didn't know.  I didn't get a fucking congratulation.  You got my money.  No, I congratulated you.  I didn't get a congratulation card or nothing.  Not one thing.  I didn't think of that.  My wife's friends sent... 
[02:06:30]  You want $5?  Or my juice card.  Cards, everything.  Not one of my friends...  We don't think of that stuff.  We don't think of that stuff.  You don't have real friends.  What do you mean, Oak?  You don't...  What does that mean?  I mean, I'm not disagreeing with you.  I'm just asking...  I have fake friends that are associated with the radio show and have real friends.  Okay.  You don't have real friends.  At all.  At all.  No.  I think Norton's my real friend.  Are you?  I mean, he didn't give me anything.  He's thinking about it.  He didn't give me anything. 
[02:07:00]  But I would have.  It was literally...  I'll tell you what happened.  Because I always give my...  No, answer the question.  Am I...  Of course.  Do you have real friends?  You are my best friends.  I think I have...  I probably have three.  All right.  In the business and in life, there's probably three people.  The mixture of the two.  No, I have real comic friends.  There's probably three or four.  That's a joke, Jimmy.  I don't know what I'm saying.  But you're right.  It's more of a joke than anything.  No, I do have friends that don't associate with this show.  You...  I fucking...  You lose friends.  Stop stumbling.  Huh?  I've lost friends over the last couple of years.  It happens. 
[02:07:30]  You know?  You come and go.  Yeah.  But I didn't...  Because you don't think it because you weren't at the event.  It just...  You know, it doesn't occur to you.  But it's not a matter of...  Why did you blow off my wedding?  No, man.  I'll tell you.  I remember I told you.  I had a $12,000 gig.  So...  One show.  That's...  That's the only years worth of work.  Hey, what are you...  Not for me.  $12,000 gig?  Jesus Christ.  I would have blown the wedding off.  That's a lot of money.  I had one gig.  This is right after Torgasm, and a lot of those gigs were popping up, and it was...  Wow.  They came to me, like, $12,000 for one show.  And I had to do 20 minutes. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, you got to take 20 fucking minutes.  That's a lot of fucking money.  It was a corporate gig.  It was not worth $12,000.  You know, worth fucking five.  I would have took a five.  I would have...  Actually, what number would you blow off for my wedding?  I need to know now.  I would have done bonuses at the Stress Factory.  Am I worth $2,500?  Yeah.  I would have canceled the gig for $2,500.  I'm not going to say it, but I'll tell you how much I blew off for Sam's wedding.  Really?  Yep.  Really?  Wow.  Sam, you better fucking take care of Jimmy.  Wow.  Nice. 
[02:08:30]  I can't believe $100,000.  Yeah, I wish.  I wouldn't blow off $100,000 if it would save Sam's life.  That's serious?  Yeah.  See what he does for Sam, but you can't do the same for me?  But it's a reschedule.  It's always the same number.  What?  It's always the same number.  I rescheduled it.  I'm just funning you.  You can reschedule?  No.  Yeah, come on.  You think I like giving up for Sammy Whammy?  Stop it.  Who's that?  I like this. 
[02:09:00]  It's Josh.  I like Josh.  Josh is all right.  I like Josh.  We like Josh.  Yeah, of course you do.  See, Josh just makes everyone happy.  I'm a big fan of this.  I wish Josh was in Cleveland.  Whoa.  Yeah, that was not Josh.  What happened?  I melted down pictures.  I listened to the show in Cleveland, by the way.  It was fucking great.  It was all right, right? 
[02:09:30]  It reminded me of back in the day.  Remember, you guys used to do that all the fucking time  and show up in the fans.  Well, we want to do more of them.  We will be doing more.  I want to pick a city we've never been to  that we just know there's a lot of fans in the area.  I think we should broadcast from Vegas.  That's my take for UFC.  I'm going, so I think we should broadcast from there.  Let's fucking do that.  Vegas, we fucking...  You get so many fans in Vegas, in that whole area.  L.A., the West Coast, but...  You see Nick Diaz.  I saw the fight.  What if I...  The Diaz brothers.  And Nate.  Over Miller, huh? 
[02:10:00]  It's Nate.  Nick is the other brother.  Oh, Nate.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  I would have thought that.  Of course you do.  Yeah, that was a great fight.  He's fucking my...  I like him.  He's one of my favorite fighters now.  He's great.  He's unbelievable.  Fuck it.  I love...  He's just a badass.  He screams at the camera.  He's taunting the guy.  Look at his hands.  Now, come on, you fucking pussy.  He is that good though, man.  That was fun.  He's great.  Great fighter.  Over Miller, right?  That was the Miller fight.  Jim Miller from Whippany, who I love.  And then who else?  What was the other fight?  Hendricks?  I didn't see that fight. 
[02:10:30]  Hendricks or Hendrickson?  I forget now.  Fuck.  The guy with the beard.  The fucking Fox fight.  Oh, Johnny Hendricks.  Yeah, Josh Kostchek lost.  Kostchek, too.  Should he have lost?  I didn't see the fight.  I tuned it in on the decision.  Yeah, I mean, look.  It's, you know...  It just went to the judges,  so you don't fucking...  Is it Hendricks or Hendricks?  I can mix it up, too.  I think it's...  Now you've got to be fucked up.  Who was the first fight?  Oh, fuck, Jim.  Thanks.  Oh, wow.  And then...  Bill Shepard against Roger Frank.  Pat Barry got fucking rocked.  Who beat him? 
[02:11:00]  What the fuck is his name?  And this guy...  Roger Franklin?  No, let me see.  I think it was Roger Franklin.  Mark Usetis?  It was Roger Franklin.  No, it wasn't.  You sure?  Yeah.  Teddy Lemons?  Roger Franklin.  Was it Teddy Lemons?  It's Dr. Steve keeps talking.  Dr. Steve!  I can't even do Ted today.  I'm just sick.  Yeah, Kostchek's eye was all sorts of fucked up.  By the way, your credit card's in your fucking thing there, Bob.  You're going to demagnetize all of them.  They don't.  I'll kill you.  They do.  They don't.  I'm licking them over there. 
[02:11:30]  Someone's got Magnus on the brain.  Yeah, the...  LeVar Johnson.  LeVar Johnson.  That guy...  E-Rock told me.  He's a fucking...  E-Rock likes to whisper in my ear.  He's a problem.  And I keep telling him, don't whisper in my ear.  Just turn on your fucking mic.  He's a heavyweight.  He's going to be a problem in the heavyweight division.  Last fight, he knocked the fucking guy out.  And this fight...  I mean, Pat Barry, he beat the fuck out of him.  Just beat the fuck out of him.  Was it a decision?  No, he knocked him the fuck out.  Knocked him out.  It was unbelievable. 
[02:12:00]  And he's going to be a problem.  This guy got fucking shot in a drive-by.  Really?  He's got a big scar down his belly.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, this guy's a...  He's a problem.  He's got a chin, and he just...  He just goes in and head hunts.  He tries to take people's heads off.  Really?  Yeah.  Fucking unbelievable.  He's a big heavyweight, right?  He's a big...  He's like prison big.  Like, he looks like the guy in prison that just did sit-ups and pull-ups.  And, you know, lifted a fucking water bag big.  That type.  He's not, like, shredded, but he's a prison big.  But, yeah, he's a fucking problem.  It was a great...  This week at Jersey, fucking great fights. 
[02:12:30]  And it was a free fight on Fox, and it was sold out.  It was packed.  Those fights used to never be packed.  Like, you know, the free fights, they'd always be, like, you know, half full or three quarters.  This was packed up.  Kenny was there.  Yeah, Kenny and Doug went.  Kenny, you have a good time?  I want to go so bad.  Should have went this weekend.  Did you have a good time, Kenny?  Oh, don't use that mic.  The UFC is one of the best organizations I know.  They really are, right?  They take care of everybody. 
[02:13:00]  They take care of people, man.  They really take care of people.  They really make you feel good.  It's amazing.  Jim Byrne and Reed Harris and Dana.  How good is Jim Byrne?  Un-fucking-believable.  And Reed Harris is...  Yeah.  He made dreams come true.  Yeah.  And his wife is hot.  When me and you were at the last one?  Whose wife's hot?  Reed Harris.  Really?  She was very attractive.  Yes.  She was there.  Yeah.  How close were you?  To Reed and his wife?  Well, yeah.  Reed sat me and my son in Dana's seats for the first two hours until Dana came out. 
[02:13:30]  And then he kicked you out?  Yeah.  Did Dana kick you out?  Yeah.  And then where'd you sit?  We just sat a few rows in the first row.  Were you on the floor?  No, the first elevated row.  Yeah, which is better than being on the floor.  We've talked about it.  I take the floor.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I do.  Dana's seats, the ones that are...  You can't see anything.  Those are Dana's seats, too.  His first family.  Yes.  Yeah.  That first row up off the floor.  You're still really close, but you can see the entire cage.  Yeah.  We sat there for Frank and... 
[02:14:00]  Frank Mir and...  Frank Mir and...  Brock Lesnar.  Yeah.  That's going to be a fucking great fight.  If John Jones was sitting right behind Dana...  Yeah.  Oh, he was on there?  Why didn't Jones do our show?  He was in New York.  Maybe he didn't do any New York press.  Yeah, but why doesn't he stop by and say, hey?  The last thing you want to do is press after you just did the whole thing.  How was it?  Did you tell him?  Fair enough.  Yeah, we went backstage.  Reed took us back afterwards, and my son got a picture with him.  He's nice, right?  Yeah.  Did he remember you?  No, because a lot of people...  Damn it.  A lot of stuff going on. 
[02:14:30]  We were there.  Reed kept bringing people to us.  I mean, he brought everybody...  He brought us fucking...  One of the Gracies.  Not one of them.  Hoist Gracie, right?  The fucking Hoist Gracie.  I know.  I know this already.  He brought Brock over to me.  I know.  No, he didn't.  When I was fucking my nephew, Nicholas, he did.  Excuse me.  I wasn't there.  I was there.  I wasn't there.  Brock came right over to us.  Yeah, Reed's great.  I wasn't there.  I know.  Reed's a classic show.  We've never done a UFC event.  I want to fucking bite your face.  Go ahead.  We should fight. 
[02:15:00]  Go ahead.  Bite.  We've never done a UFC event together.  No.  We should go to Vegas.  I've been to four already.  Dude, we should broadcast from fucking Vegas.  We're supposed to go Saturday.  I know.  Why didn't you go to that one?  That was a fucking great one.  I was tired.  Fucking what?  From being outside all day.  See what I did.  It's like almost homeless.  I know.  It's like a homeless man.  I know.  You have a homeless man's schedule.  By the way, I blew it.  I just got a fucking text.  From who?  It says, no one who says I'm a nice guy is a nice guy. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Who said that?  Your wife?  I love that you're an asshole.  Don't lose it.  Fuck.  Why?  Who loves that you're an asshole?  Somebody.  Who?  Somebody.  I liked the live show in Cleveland.  It was great.  Oh, yeah.  That's where we're at.  You know what was great?  Sam's show before it, him stumbling through that.  He is a prick.  Him stumbling trying to.  Were you stumbling, Sam?  No.  Sam doesn't like that.  How is Sam?  Sam doesn't like to be criticized.  You're going to have to deal with Sam now. 
[02:16:00]  Once you got your shit going, but at the beginning of the show when you were just trying to get  people into it, that was the first one he ever did.  That was my job.  Yeah.  Well, I thought it was funny just seeing you stumble through your shit.  He was sloppy, right?  Very.  He will never acknowledge that he was sloppy.  Very sloppy.  It was a well done show.  Very wordy.  He was just going on and on and on.  Tell him.  So where are you from?  What are you going to do?  Are you going to do this?  Are you going to come up?  Are you going to do this?  Well, that was the purpose of that show was meeting the audience.  Oh, was it?  Yes, it was.  And then that's why many of the people we met during that hour were brought back for the 
[02:16:30]  main show.  You made the main show better.  That's right.  So without your pre-show, we would have been fine.  But I also did it by doing a great pre-show.  Yep.  I did two things.  I made the main show better and I was able to pull off an entertaining pre-show.  What do you think was better, the main show or your pre-show?  The main show is always going to be better.  How close were you to the main show?  Does it pain you to say that?  No.  It pains you to say that, right?  It does.  It pains him to say that.  It does.  How close were you to the main show?  Not like inches or miles or feet? 
[02:17:00]  I would give...  Inches, feet or miles?  Yards.  Yards.  That's like three foot's a yard.  I know what a yard is.  Yeah.  I watch football.  Yeah.  So you...  Like a yard.  Yeah, yards.  Yep.  Multiple yards.  Not a yard.  Multiple yards.  So you're not inches away from the main show?  No, not inches yet.  You're far away from the main show.  I need a little more experience under my belt.  Right.  How many yards and a foot?  17.  That's wrong.  Mm-hmm.  How many yards and a foot?  How many yards and a foot?  Are you fucking dumb?  How many yards and a foot? 
[02:17:30]  I know.  Go ahead, Sam.  One third.  Thank you.  That was a trick question.  One third is the answer.  Ooh, you're a little wizard.  That was a trick question.  You're like the Game of Thrones.  Ba-na-na-na.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Ah, you're doing the dance.  You want to do the dance?  I don't want to do the dance.  Maybe.  It was fun watching Jimmy do the dance.  Can we take a break?  Because I don't know what the fuck's going on today.  Really?  Yeah.  Should we do it after the break?  Sure.  All right.  We got something after the break.  I promise you.  And we got another cloud video. 
[02:18:00]  Well, it's audio for the people out there.  We'll put it on our Facebook page.  I want to thank your listeners for helping me win the comedy award last night, by the  way.  You're welcome.  Mm-hmm.  Well, what?  I won a comedy award.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did?  Impossible.  Couldn't have happened.  What are you talking about impossible?  Oh, sorry.  I want to fucking punch you right in your fucking noggin.  Right?  Not even the front of your face.  The back of your head.  Oh, that would hurt.  I know.  It would be like fucking like a thump.  I'll take a punch to... 
[02:18:30]  Where?  The side of your head?  No, I would let you punch me in the eye.  Whoa!  Right in the eye?  Yeah, the nose would be fucked.  The jaw, I'm sure you'd fucking knock me out.  I wouldn't want to punch you in the eye because then if I fucked up your orbitable bone, your  wife...  Kenny?  What about the chin?  Robert, you have to be careful punching people in the back of the head because the skull  is harder than your hand bones.  You're a little fucking...  Ugh.  You fucking face right now.  Why?  I just...  Did you really win a comedy award? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Yes, you did.  For what?  Best comedy app.  Best comedy app?  Yeah.  See, Jimmy's saying no.  Yeah, I did.  Jimmy doesn't believe you either.  I did?  I want to punch you right in your face.  You really don't.  I do.  Is it really...  I actually want to punch you in your stomach because I want to hear you go like this.  I want to hear you go...  Ugh!  Ugh!  Why don't you arm wrestle?  Yeah.  All right.  I almost got a huge fight at the Springsteen show.  Holy fuck.  Really?  Yeah, I was in a...  I was in a...  Me too with Bruce.  I was in a tough spot.  You were even there. 
[02:19:30]  Why?  Was it a kid?  No.  Six foot three.  Easily six foot three.  Fucking ripped.  Then you weren't in a tough spot.  Avoid the fight.  Smart move.  I did.  Yeah.  But you didn't want me looking him in the eyes.  And I said, fuck you, I'm looking you in the eyes.  What?  Don't say you...  Just because a fight didn't happen doesn't mean you avoided it.  I was...  What do you mean he didn't...  He pulled some alpha male shit?  Oh, yeah, he did.  He pulled some...  I didn't back down, though.  Some more shit?  But I was like, fuck, this could be a problem.  What happened?  What did he say to you?  Don't look at me in the eyes?  No, it was just an issue.  We're fine.  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Because the guy was standing in front of Opie after we had been...  No, we got amazing fucking seats.  Well, we stood in front of Bruce Springsteen.  We're like 20 feet away.  Easy.  Right.  But that area, you had to get there early because there was about 300 or 400 people that could  be close.  So everyone got their spot.  And we're all standing there in our spots.  And this guy, literally, as the show's being introduced, you know, the band's starting to  come out, walks, pushes his way through the crowd, and he's 6'3", stands literally right  the fuck in front of me. 
[02:20:30]  And I didn't start any shit.  The guy next to me, who was about my height, maybe a little taller, goes, he was the one  who goes, seriously, we've all been standing here for an hour, and you're just going to  walk?  And not only that, you're going to now block my view?  And then he goes to me, and then points to me and goes, and he's pissed, too.  And I don't even know this guy.  Dick.  So then I'm totally cool, and I'm looking around the guy.  I'm fucking pissed.  I'm steaming inside.  And then all of a sudden, he starts backing up into me.  So then I might have said something.  What'd you say?  Like what?  I said, I yelled it really loud. 
[02:21:00]  What?  I said, it's bad enough that you're standing right the fuck in front of me, and now you're  going to push me for the rest of the fucking show.  Right.  And then he sort of said sorry and moved to the side.  I'm like, oh, fuck, that worked.  Really?  And now I'm looking at Bruce like I'm looking at you.  This close.  But I could see by his body language, he was really mad, but he didn't know what to  do with it.  So then he turns around out of nowhere and just starts screaming an inch from my nose, 
[02:21:30]  go, pick your battles, bro.  Pick your battles, bro.  Don't fucking look at me.  I'm like, I'm looking at you.  Now what?  And I just stood there.  Yeah, but the guy owned the Prudential Center.  Oh yeah, he told me, he goes, do you know who the fuck you're messing with?  I wasn't messing with him, because I own this fucking place.  Really?  Pick your battles, bro.  That's impressive.  He wanted me to take a swing at him first for whatever reason.  I don't know who the fuck the guy was.  He was intimidating. 
[02:22:00]  I'm not going to lie to you.  He said he owned the building?  Yeah.  He owned shit.  Who's doing that?  Did you see it?  You can find that out.  I told Kenny on the way in, and Kenny finally goes through.  He goes, so who was he that he owned the building?  Missed the whole point of the story.  No, let's get a photo up.  What?  Well, it's owned by the Puck Holdings Group.  Yeah, but if it hit images, it'll probably bring them up.  Oh God, if I see.  That would be funny if he was Puck.  That would be hilarious.  That would be so fucking.  But the guy was literally in my face, and he was trying to make me not look at him. 
[02:22:30]  I'm like, yeah, all right, I'm not going to look at you.  Was it those guys?  No, no.  He was young.  So wait, you were a bit younger than me.  What did you say when he said that to you?  I'm looking at you.  Now what?  He said .com?  Yeah.  You weren't scared at all?  I was scared inside.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe I wasn't.  But what am I going to do?  And what did he say after you said that?  I just kept staring in his eyes.  He goes, stop, don't look at me in the eyes.  And then I go, now what?  And then I made believe I couldn't hear him half the time, which really fucking pissed him off. 
[02:23:00]  But the music was loud.  He kept going, what?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's great.  I kept going, what?  What?  Like that.  And he goes, stop looking at me in the eyes.  I'm like, now what?  I'm looking at you in the eyes.  I was scared inside.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah.  And then he walked away.  He left.  Yeah.  Wow.  You fucking backed him down.  I guess.  I don't know.  I don't like your humbleness.  Sam, what is your take on?  That was pretty intense.  Were you nervous?  No, because I didn't know until he told me the story after what was going on, because 
[02:23:30]  Opie didn't.  Was the guy right in my fucking face?  He was right in your face, but you.  Literally nose to nose.  Why would Sam ever be nervous in any fight situation?  He's, you, you get to back out and walk away.  Why would you, you wouldn't be nervous in any fight situation.  Let's go and start fights.  Yeah.  Because you walk away.  I didn't start a fight.  I was just pissed off.  Yeah.  But if that, like, if I was in a fight, would you help him?  No, no.  You wouldn't, you, you wouldn't even help.  Fucking, you wouldn't even try to bite an ankle and jump on his leg at least. 
[02:24:00]  If Roland jumped in before me and started, then I would jump in after that.  Cause then it's cool.  No one, just watch him take a beating.  No one.  And I would, I would, I would take a beating.  Right.  Well, I mean.  I was out of my league.  I know that.  What good does it do if the both of us take a beating?  You know?  Someone's got to be here to fucking run the show.  Right.  Exactly.  No one sucks.  He's telling the truth.  Absolutely.  You know, if he saw you catching a beating.  Roland.  Roland.  Would you jump in and listen to this answer?  Drane Bruce has a tough call. 
[02:24:30]  Can you imagine if I got everyone kicked out the first song in cause of this idiot?  Wait, would you, would you have said something I think I stood right in front of you?  If you were 6'3"?  I would just, because I know, it's like, yeah, the Bruce show, people get wasted.  I would just, like, walk around him.  Oh, you wouldn't pay it personally?  Everyone was annoyed in my area with this guy.  Yeah.  Because he just came out of nowhere.  He was a asshole.  Yeah.  But, uh, right next to Sam, there's a little hole.  Did you just throw up in your mouth?  So we would have ran to the little side.  Oh, I thought you'd be able to.  You would have ran to the side. 
[02:25:00]  I would have put Sam like this, and then we're like, hold on, the fight's over.  If the guy kept bumping into you, would you have fucking said something?  Yeah, I would have been a dick.  By the way, I'd become a bigger Springsteen fan.  And Roland.  He was great, right?  He was unbelievable.  Did you guys get backstage?  Ah, sort of.  We were all over the place.  We were in Little Stevens, what?  Lounge.  Did you get to meet him?  Oh, no, because it was the last day of the tour.  First time he ever played the arena.  So they say he was in the zone.  Because he never played arena before.  He's not in the zone.  Because what I found out, because you gave me a copy of the Apollo Theater show, he said 
[02:25:30]  the exact same shit.  So what kind of zone could he be in if he's just memorizing what he's saying?  He's not in between songs.  But he makes it sound like he's making it up.  But when you see two shows and you realize, holy shit, word for word, he's saying the  same stuff in between songs.  But different songs.  But with that said, Roland fucking burned me a copy of the Apollo show that he did for  Series X.  It was awesome, dude.  It was amazing.  It was awesome.  I'm a bigger Springsteen fan today.  The guy could send some soulful shit. 
[02:26:00]  No way.  I was on vacation.  Yeah, he was great.  I liked some of the new stuff, too.  I mean, I bought the album.  I really liked a lot of the new stuff.  Yeah.  I like the fact that he doesn't rest on what he's done.  He's always doing new shit.  I like the fact that he does mixed set lists.  I respect that a lot.  He's going to do his whole catalog for real fans.  Yeah, his wife wasn't there that night.  Why?  She was protecting the drugs.  That's what Bruce said from the stage.  From the kids. 
[02:26:30]  The drug stash from the kids.  She's the one was it for me.  That was an amazing song.  Did he do Youngstown ever?  He did the night before.  Did he do Youngstown?  No.  Yeah, the Youngstown.  But he did the Bishop Dance, which he didn't perform for 40 years.  Who cares?  There's a reason why he didn't perform for 40 years.  Then he did the Wake.  There's other songs to play.  How was that?  It was amazing.  Did he do the Hitter?  I'd want to see the Hitter a lot.  I'm weird.  The songs I like by Springsteen are obscure, weird ones.  I don't even like his hits.  The Hitter, he did once last tour.  He hasn't done it this tour. 
[02:27:00]  But you see him every time.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to the Med Life shows.  And I understand why people go and see him a lot.  Because you can see different songs.  I understand it.  He's that good.  He's got 17 people on the fucking stage.  Coming up in September.  He's playing Philadelphia.  Like a sassy black woman.  He's fucking good, man.  Seeing him live was very, very impressive.  I didn't realize how soulful he was.  Dude, he was doing a small show for the Apollo.  That's like me doing a 10-seat theater.  What he did, him doing the Apollo, is me doing 10 seats.  No.  And he was a fucking animal. 
[02:27:30]  He did two hours.  He was running up and down like a fucking, just, you know, like a gorilla fucking swinging  from the rafters.  And I was like, climbing down the thing.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  This guy's an animal.  My OCD kicked in on the way home from the communion, because that was my music I was  listening to back and forth.  What were the last two songs he did?  I pulled into my garage.  I'm like, fuck.  The last song he did, Apollo, I think it was...  I listened to the whole two-hour show, but the last two songs, he came out for the encore.  I think it's Land of Hope and Dreams into 10th Avenue Friesout. 
[02:28:00]  How long did he do at these days?  3.20?  How does his voice hold out that long?  That's what the amazing part is, is that he can sing.  He's learned how to...  Whatever his fucking voice can...  That was my impression.  He figured something out with his voice.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  For Levon, when he did The Wait, everybody freaked out, because since he passed away two  nights before the show.  Levon Helms?  Yeah, he did...  Yeah, that was a really good cover.  Oh, The Wait.  The Wait.  I don't know that...  Can you bring that up?  The Wait?  Can you bring that up, Sam? 
[02:28:30]  What were you saying?  It's on YouTube.  They have the Bruce cover.  It was amazing.  So why don't we play it at a break and kill some time?  Yeah, let's make love.  I gotta get out of here by 10, because I have my fucking acne and people coming.  Bobby, why do you want to punch me all the time?  Yeah, why, Bob?  What's wrong with you?  You're annoying sometimes.  No, I'm not really annoying.  Yeah, no, like...  But not in a...  I'm good.  I'm good.  Me and you, we're good.  Let's keep it that way.  Like a little...  We're good.  Like brothers.  You know when you're brothers, you want to fucking annoy you?  I don't have any brothers.  Shut up.  Okay.  What was I supposed to do? 
[02:29:00]  Not look at that guy at the Springsteen show?  Nah.  I was in a tough spot.  You did the right thing.  I'm not gonna...  I can't believe you fucking did that.  I don't fucking throw a karate chop at him.  I love that you were...  I do that too.  What?  Huh?  And you make people repeat it?  He was so fucking...  He wanted to hit me so bad.  I could see it in his eyes.  But for whatever reason, he didn't.  He probably is someone.  He probably is somebody.  That's why he didn't fucking hit you.  I mean, everyone in that area knows somebody.  He might have a family.  He might have a family.  Yeah, he might be related to a bodyguard.  And then I'm thinking, oh, fuck.  The UFC is less than a week out.  Is he a UFC guy? 
[02:29:30]  No.  Who knows?  UFC guy wouldn't have done that because they know...  Those guys don't fucking fight people.  Yeah, I was like...  His nephew looks like him.  Who?  Remember the nephew who was in front of us?  I don't know.  Bruce's nephew waiting for tickets.  Oh.  UFC guys don't go pick your battles, man.  Never.  Pick your battles.  Bro.  They don't do that shit.  I'll meet you in the octagon, man.  Pick your battles, bro.  What does that mean?  The octagon.  I thought you called it the octagon.  Let me see the cover.  It's amazing.  How long is the audio on this version? 
[02:30:00]  How long is this?  It's about six minutes.  Is the audio good?  That might be too long.  Let me hear just a second.  Let me hear a second.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it's really good.  Were we at this show?  You left early.  Why?  We split the whole.  What's up?  Hey, hey, hey.  I don't like it.  Bobby, what do you promote?  I want to hear the original song.  I don't know what this song is.  You know the song.  Bobby is promoting the Anti-Social Comedy Tour with myself, Artie, Nick DiPaolo, and Dave 
[02:30:30]  Attell.  When are you going to put one of your friends on there?  June 9th.  It's not my call.  It's Live Nation.  June 9th at the MGM in Foxwoods.  Eight o'clock.  One show only.  I don't know.  I think tickets are selling.  I have not even checked up on it a month.  I love Artie.  I do, too.  He's doing well.  I love Artie.  He's got almost 50,000 people on Twitter.  He just started.  I just did a show the other night.  He's fucking funny as shit.  I've never been invited on the show.  I wouldn't know.  You walk in from 10 to 1.  You can just walk in.  Yeah, that's what he said.  Just come on any time.  That's what people say. 
[02:31:00]  They don't want to invite you.  No, I'm fucking...  He did.  Jimmy's right.  I said Thursday.  But Jimmy's right.  That's what you do.  We do that all the time.  Yeah, he's strong.  They've never asked me to be on the show.  All right, we're going to break, and we're going to...  Oh, Sam really does have something for after the break.  Do you have the...  Yes, I do.  Put on the leave on help song.  I want to hear it.  We can play it at the break.  Yeah.  He's dead, this guy.  Why are we going with the live version?  I think this is the most famous one from The Last Wall.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, yeah, okay.  This is in The Big Chill, I believe.  A little trivia for people.  Why don't I shut up?  Yvonne Helms is singing.  We can play it.  A man might find a bed.  He just randomly shook my head.  Know was all he said.  Take a load off Fanny.  Take a load for free.

[02:33:30]  This offer expires Friday at midnight.  The Mafia always treated me right.  I'm just saying, though.  They get a bad rap.  The guys at Governors are the nicest club owners ever.  I'm not saying they're popular.  James and his...  No, they're not. 
[02:34:00]  I'm talking about the other thing we're talking about.  Yeah, the other thing.  Yeah, his wife and him and his kids.  All his kids run the club, too.  He's the nicest people ever.  I loved working for the Mafia.  I worked for them legit, though.  Really?  When?  I don't want to say.  Why?  Because now I got to keep it vague, I just realized.  What did you have to keep it vague?  I worked for the Mafia.  What?  People know that.  Legit, though.  I was legit.  What do you mean?  They were just the nicest guys, and they took care of you.  Yeah, they'd take care of you until they'd take care of you.  I'm in the Mafia. 
[02:34:30]  No, the gig I had, they weren't going to do anything.  Yeah.  What'd you do?  Would you sell fucking ice?  What?  Sell fucking Italian ice somewhere?  What'd you do?  No, it was a legit job for the Mafia.  Fuck yeah.  What?  I can't say.  I was a button fell.  You're not a rat.  A what?  A rat?  If it was legit, you're not a rat.  You're fine.  Yeah, but then maybe some of these guys don't want to know they're in the Mafia.  I don't like how you turn into a mob guy, right?  These guys don't fucking get good, but get good.  I do things. 
[02:35:00]  I fucking kill people.  You used to do things.  Legit, though, Bobby.  Fuck yeah.  I was chasing ice through the snow.  What?  I wish fucking someone said a mob hit on chip.  That ain't gonna happen.  You want that to happen?  Yeah.  All right.  What?  You gonna make it happen?  You getting your phone right now?  My mob game was Lil Chippy D.  No, no, no.  Oh, don't.  Don't.  I'm kidding, though.  Don't take the...  You said you want this.  Lil Chippy D.  You gonna text a hit out on chip right now?  I'll just go, y'all in the Mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, fuck it.  Go ahead.  Do it.  Send it out.  Send the hit out.  I'll be a hit, man.  Oh, my God.  A Jimmy Drop stand.  How uncomfortable would that be?  Oh, my God.  I am going on the record and saying I didn't do shit.  I'm going on the record and saying that he did.  I just looked and I saw Kill Chip, a.k.a. Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas.  I was the ice guy.  The ice guy.  Yeah, the Italian ice guy.  I'll go, you want some Italian ice? 
[02:36:00]  They'll go, oh, forget about it, Chippy.  They know.  I thought you were the ice guy.  Yeah.  And what does the D stand for?  Your last name is Chippy.  Death.  Why do you have to...  Destruction.  Why does his face do that?  Yeah, why does your face...  Why do you bite your bottom lip when you talk?  I'm just talking.  My teeth do what they got to do.  Why do you bite pizzas?  I'm not supposed to laugh.  Double guns.  Double guns.  Oops.  All right, listen.  Sam's got something for the show.  Hopefully AIDS. 
[02:36:30]  Whoa.  Why would you say that?  Because I want you to die.  I want you to die.  Fuck you, you cocksucker.  I hope there's a fire at your wedding and everybody burns up or something except me.  What type of thing is that to say to anybody?  You can't come to the wedding, you idiot.  I'm going to the wedding.  I got fucking invited.  You did not.  I'll throw fucking coffee on you, piece of shit.  You're a piece of dog shit.  Fuck, you have some thumbs.  Everybody hates you.  Everybody hates you.  I'm funny.  You're not funny and everybody hates you.  I don't give a fuck about nothing.  They like me, don't they?  No.  You idiot.  A bunch of bullshit.  That's moron.  I love Angry Chip. 
[02:37:00]  It's disturbing.  Angry Chip makes me happy.  Yeah, well, how about you don't make me happy or nothing?  Or nothing.  That's an egg white.  I do.  I have them right here.  Yeah, I hope they fucking got cancer on them.  What's wrong with you, Chip?  I got viral video.  Fuck you.  What?  Yeah, you got a viral video, Chip.  Chip does.  Not Angry Chip.  No, it was Angry Chip.  Was it Angry Chip?  Oh, no, it was Angry Chip.  It was Angry Chip.  That's got like 260,000 views, right?  Yeah.  That stupid Chip video.  That's amazing. 
[02:37:30]  We did it.  The Uncomfortable Moment, Chip?  Yeah.  It's got how many views?  260.  We were in the fucking car.  It was on the front page of Reddit.  People were talking about Angry Chip.  In a week.  Or Crazy Chip.  280,000.  280.  It's not even that great, but I mean, it's okay.  It's for a Chip video.  I mean, that's not great.  That's amazing.  280,000.  Any under a million is shit, but I mean, it's so good.  Are you fucking stupid?  No.  Not very smart.  200 is good.  Real good.  Hopefully.  Unfortunately, our Don't Stop Believing video didn't do as well. 
[02:38:00]  How many hits?  You don't want to know.  Yeah, I want to know how many.  I don't give a shit.  It doesn't affect my self-esteem.  It does.  No, it doesn't.  10 Gs.  That's a lot of people, though.  That's all right.  Isn't it?  Is that not good for you?  I was hoping for more.  No, because I thought you doing Don't Stop Believing the last time you were in it.  Did you see him doing Don't Stop Believing?  No.  He really gets into it.  I never listen when I'm not here.  It suppresses me that I'm not there.  That's a cool little production piece you did there.  Thank you.  Yes.  That's good.  No, I had to talk.  It's a small-town girl living in the lonely world. 
[02:38:30]  She took the midnight train going anywhere.  He really gets into it.  Just a city boy.  Born and raised in South Detroit.  He took the midnight train going anywhere.  Here's the best part.  Now I know why it only did 10 Gs.  Because it's kind of good. 
[02:39:00]  It was too good?  It wasn't cartoony enough?  It's not.  It's too good to be ironic.  Well.  Right, Bobo?  You put that up on that Facebook page.  Open Anthony, please.  Like us, motherfuckers.  Get rid of the ham.  And also the chip videos up there, Iraq.  For the people that have not seen it.  Get plain egg whites.  It's all up there somewhere.  What did he put in his egg whites to make it unhealthy?  Ham.  So I said get rid of the fucking ham.  You don't need that.  What's wrong with it, Bobby?  The egg whites.  Let's go.  It's old habits.  And dry toast.  You can do this.  Last night we were at the store.  And he's telling me what to get Weight Watchers shit, right? 
[02:39:30]  And I'm like, okay.  Just a couple of little snack meals.  He's like, this is good.  This is good.  I start grabbing all of them.  He's like, this is your problem.  Yeah.  You addict.  And Bob goes like, I'm like, it's not a rare item.  They sell it.  Right.  You can come back and get it.  You didn't need to just find copies of Superman 1.  You discover the Weight Watchers ice cream.  Yeah, they're great though, right?  The raspberry ice cream pops.  I got those.  Those are good.  Those things are ridiculous.  I haven't tried them yet.  My problem is I eat four in one set.  They're only two points.  Not if you have four.  It's eight points.  But again, if you set aside points, you go fuck it. 
[02:40:00]  But one Klondike bar will fucking destroy them.  The Klondike bar is fucking...  I got the raspberry bars.  Raspberry.  I got the cookies and cream, which is un-fucking-below.  Dude, it's four points.  The four-point ice cream bar.  And the fucking ice cream sandwiches are good.  You know what's good for three points?  Those fucking taffy...  The toffee ones.  Frozen toffee.  They got Snicker fucking bars at four points.  How finished are we?  We used to fucking bang chicks in Brazil with no condoms.  And eat fucking raviolas three times a day. 
[02:40:30]  And now we're talking about points.  Speaking of Bob Kelly's food obsession, did you hear his live read?  Yeah, microwave or something.  He said microwave twice when the cop said microphone.  That's just because he's dumb, though.  We have the clip?  Yeah, we have it.  I'm not dumb.  Can I hear this?  I'm very smart.  Don't play the whole live read.  No, it's ten seconds.  Ten seconds.  I know a lot of shit more than you.  Shut up.  Let me hear this.  Please.  You're just dumb.  Visit berries.com.  Click the microwave in the top right corner.  Type in Opie.  Go to berries.com.  Click on the microwave and type in Opie.  Hurry.  Why are you saying microwave? 
[02:41:00]  Because he's dumb.  It says microphone on the paper.  I fucking...  I didn't read it.  Microphone-y baloney.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't read it.  I just skimmed through it and I should have read it.  Fair enough.  Uh-oh.  What do you got?  You got Roland snoring?  Roland...  Didn't we do this already?  No.  Roland took a snooze in the office.  I was praying.  Why are you tired, Roland?  Um, I took an allergy pill.  Huh?  I took an allergy pill.  That'll do it.  Why?  Because I'm having bad allergies.  Yeah, but you can't take allergy pills.  What do you love?  You do hard work or something?  Cocksucker?  Leave Roland alone.  Angry chip. 
[02:41:30]  If not, I've been worse, so...  What allergy pill did you take?  Like Claritin D.  Claritin?  That'll do it.  You took a Claritin?  I took an allergy pill on the way home.  Not an allergy pill, a fucking cold.  No alcohol.  I made sure on the way home I was starting to feel sick on the red eye.  Fucking plain, man.  That helped me sleep.  I don't fuck with those things, usually.  I was praying for people, too.  Who were you praying for?  Jesus.  Why Jesus?  Because he helps us.  I did some Jesus yesterday.  Oh, yeah, and I took that wafer.  Yeah, I did.  Nice.  You got the body of Christ? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, I do the body of Christ a few times a year.  Yeah, but you can't just go get it.  You have to...  You can't just...  I fucking just went and got it, man.  That's like fucking against the law.  I want to know if they sell it in stores.  Probably.  Where they sell that stuff.  They do.  Like little wafers.  Yeah, the nilla wafers.  I didn't go for the wine thing, though.  That's too weird.  Well, everybody drinks half of it.  I'm like, ew.  Yeah, it's too much bed, breath, and fucking backwash.  Sometimes you see homeless people online.  It's hilarious.  Do you do the wine?  I don't.  You can't do the wine.  I've been sober 27 years.  Don't they clean it off, though? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, with a rag.  They usually do grape juice, too, now.  They don't do wine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Then you're not getting the real body of Christ.  I don't want no body of Christ or something.  Christ is going to be like, hey, you bite me.  How are you getting the real body of Christ with the grape juice?  They just bless it.  Same shit.  Ah, it's dumb.  It's got to be the real stuff.  What are we drinking?  You're not supposed to get the body of Christ.  I went and got the body of Christ.  What was the last time we did confession?  Huh?  What was the last time we did confession?  I don't know.  Today, I guess.  You did confession today?  Yeah, on the show. 
[02:43:00]  This isn't confession.  Yeah, it's killing mafia people, bad people.  We admit stuff.  What the fuck did you admit?  I admitted that I want to be liked.  I admitted I was scared inside when I stared that big monster down.  I had many karate chopping people.  What else did I admit?  Fuck it.  I admit that I never used your gift certificate from the wedding.  See, you want to confess?  I want to confess.  Can I have that back?  I don't know where it is.  But I guarantee there's a priest out there.  He heard all the stuff, and he blessed the radio.  I'm good now. 
[02:43:30]  Fucking kill him.  I don't think there's a priest.  You think there's a priest listening to the show?  I guarantee we have at least one priest listening.  I guarantee it.  How much do you want to bet?  $70,000.  That's what I make for a show.  Just ignore him.  You're doing good.  I can't.  It's hard.  It's really easy.  But it's hard.  I'm focusing on your face.  It's me and you look at each other in the eyes.  Yeah, and then you're going to have some shit.  We're good right now.  So you can't.  You can't.  You're not supposed to go and get the body.  I got the body.  I'll fucking eat the whole thing.  I got a little piece of the body.  Give me that wine, man. 
[02:44:00]  I brought my kid up there with his milk bottle, and we did it together.  He's not even fucking.  Why not?  He don't know no body.  Give me a second.  You have to eat your first communion first.  He was hungry.  You can't get.  I don't eat the Lord's head.  I gave the kid a little taste.  Why not?  I'm waiting for the drive, man.  Give me some brewskis.  You took one and then broke a piece off.  Why not?  I'll break a fucking leg.  What's he going to do?  Give me a fuck.  He was drinking the milk afterwards.  Fuck milk, man.  I drink fucking wine and stuff. 
[02:44:30]  Whiskey.  Yeah.  I had a flask.  Do you ever get jealous that the priest gets a real big one and we get that little one?  Fuck, I can't.  Of course you would say that, Bobby.  Why do you make it so easy?  Why would you get jealous over that?  That was the joke, stupid.  Mine is 15 inches.  Yeah, but I didn't know it was a joke.  Well, of course you did because you laughed.  That was a joke.  You laughed.  So you set up yourself?  I tell jokes.  I'm very laughing at my jokes.  You don't set up yourself usually.  Yeah, you do sometimes.  But you don't usually.  I do.  You do?  On this show.  I set a bunch of people up when I was fucking killing people.  Absolutely.  Come on down here. 
[02:45:00]  I talk to you fucking Joey Feats.  Wow.  Ignore him.  It's scary, right?  You're doing good.  My left eye hurts.  I'll fucking knock the right one right out of your fucking skull with a karate chop.  Fucking cocksucker.  If I had a pop quiz right now, I swear to you, I wouldn't be able to do that.  I wouldn't be able to tell you what he said.  Yeah, you would.  Really?  I'll fucking tell you at gunpoint.  Fucking Wolf Chippathy is in the house.  No clue.  Shooting the whole town up or something.  I would fail the pop quiz.  Why would you tell him at gunpoint?  That's right.  Fucking lardness.  Did you see Avengers? 
[02:45:30]  Fuck yeah.  I was in it.  I don't watch superhero movies.  Yeah.  What?  You say that.  Like a snob.  I was Radishman.  Because we didn't get a superhero on our show.  We got a supervillain.  You got Loki.  He's the star of Loki.  I didn't get Loki.  You got Loki.  Yeah, I want you to Loki right at this.  Loki.  You didn't get Loki?  You did.  He franchised the interview out.  Loki was coming in here and Opie decided that me and E-Rock were going to play Opie.  He's a great actor.  Oh, I thought you were going to say that's a great act.  Yeah, we had Sam and E-Rock play Opie and Anthony for Loki.  Who's Loki?  I want a fucking superhero, not a supervillain. 
[02:46:00]  He's fucking great.  And then I talked to Clark Gregg, who has a lesser part of the movie.  Who did you want to hear?  Robert Downey Jr.?  That would be all right.  Scarlett Johansson?  I mean, maybe we're reaching a little too high, but I would have taken Chris Evans.  He's a fan of our show, believe it or not.  He's filming Captain America, too, though.  Did we have him in for Captain America or that other piece of shit movie?  Captain America.  That was a bust.  Push.  Push.  He was here for Captain America.  Push.  He was in Push.  Joe McHale came in for that one.  Yeah.  I like Chris Evans.  The movie Push is actually a great movie. 
[02:46:30]  And it's kind of like, not a superhero movie, but they, well, kind of.  They have superhero powers or something.  What's a Push?  It's called Push.  The movie Push.  It's just a great fucking movie.  About what?  That he's in.  These people that have powers.  Almost like X-Men type people.  I never heard of it.  It was a fucking great movie.  You should watch it.  Was it a superhero movie?  X-Men type-y superhero.  I don't do superhero movies.  I do Iron Man, though.  I did Iron Man.  Iron Man's one of my favorite ones.  Is Batman a superhero movie?  Yeah.  I saw the actual Iron Man head thing this week.  Oh.  I was at Robert Downey Jr.'s production company. 
[02:47:00]  Ooh.  Was he there?  No, he was not there.  What do you got, Sam?  But they have the Iron Man head.  You want to hear Roland in the office from, like, literally half an hour ago?  Yeah.  G2 my LG pillow.  I'm hearing you die. 
[02:47:30]  Dude, you got to take care of that.  It's that last push of air that scares the fuck out of me.  It's normal snoring, and then you can hear all the air trying to get out of his body.  That's normal.  That you can handle.  Listen for the air push. 
[02:48:00]  That's all right.  It's not all right.  It's not like a Star Wars monster.  I couldn't know you were sleeping while we were trying to entertain everyone.  Thanks.  I heard this show does this to people.  This is what your audience is doing right now.  Of course.  Of course.  And his left leg was moving the whole time.  Like, when a dog sleeps in there. 
[02:48:30]  Is he all right?  He had REM.  Yeah.  Is he all right?  No, he's dying.  That's dying?  That's very bad.  It's dangerous.  I don't know if I have...  It's your heart.  Your heart gets overworked when you do that shit.  It's very dangerous.  Roland.  Roland.  Roland's sad now.  Bruce.  No, you should take care of that, Roland.  You're losing the weight.  Are you still doing good with that?  Mm-hmm.  And then lose some weight because it will be a little bit easier. 
[02:49:00]  And then check for apnea and stuff.  Or that mouth guard they make.  Rogan apparently uses that.  He emailed me about it.  Or he knows someone that uses it.  He mentioned it to me.  He said it would help.  He might have a friend that uses it.  All right.  That was some fucking deep snoring right there.  That was, right?  Yeah.  What's up?  You're awake now?  Yeah.  It's an allergy pill.  Knock me out.  No one sleeps that deeply from an hour.  It makes you a little woozy and a little weird. 
[02:49:30]  You're not conked out.  That's actually sleep.  What are you talking about?  That's like...  That's fucking...  I'm out.  I'm gone.  An allergy pill.  You're fighting to stay awake.  That's a decision.  Right.  That fucking sleep that we just heard was a decision.  I'm going to take a nap for the next 10 minutes.  That's...  I could never sleep like that in a work environment.  I could.  You could?  You could nod out like that?  I could fucking nod out anywhere.  No way, man.  Absolutely.  I could do what he did.  No way.  I could sleep in a fucking...  I could sleep in a chair. 
[02:50:00]  I could sleep on a fucking train.  I could sleep in a...  Anywhere.  I could take a little nap.  Everything has to be perfect for me to sleep.  Perfect temperature.  A little breeze coming in the window, maybe.  You have windows in your apartment?  What do you think?  That open?  That high up?  They open about this much?  Yeah, about...  Like an inch?  I'm worried about...  About three inches, maybe?  I got ten inches.  Four inches?  Tops?  How much does that suck?  Eh, fuck...  Well, I mean, I wouldn't be able to look out your window.  You're a kid.  You don't want your window open before you. 
[02:50:30]  No, of course not.  Do you have window guards on yet?  No.  You got some Derek Clapton.  Why do you need window guards?  You can't get through there.  It opens four inches.  What, is he going to mush out?  You can't get through there.  He's not made of water.  What do you think?  Now, what do you think?  My kid has a pinhead?  You can't get through there?  What if he's jumping up and playing and fucking bangs through the window?  You got to get a window guard, dude.  No, you don't.  Yes, you do.  Window guard is for fucking windows that open.  Thank you, Bobby.  I've run...  It's not...  I've run full speed into my windows to prove to people that...  You wouldn't do that?  Oh, the fucking...  I'm afraid of heights. 
[02:51:00]  That scares me thinking about that.  Come on over.  I'll do it for you.  No, I would never watch it.  It's amazing the reaction people get.  How great would it be if it didn't work?  You get a great reaction from people.  If it didn't work, he would just see you fly up.  I'd go run and jump on my couch and like, boom, right into the fucking thing.  Would you do that?  If we saw him do that and it smashed through and you'd say, fuck!  The last thing he'd hear is fucking just big laughs.  I sure hope you would.  Fuck, dude.  Come on over so I can do it for you.  You should get a window guard.  I'll record it.  It freaks people out. 
[02:51:30]  Those windows you can't break.  Full speed into a window.  You don't fucking want to know that, though.  They're fucking hurricane proof.  They're...  What hurricane?  Hey, did you see...  I keep saying window guard.  I want to get a window guard and fucking...  I need a guy for the gun and stuff.  Find this online.  There's an apartment that some dude redid and his bathroom's over an old elevator shaft  and he put a glass fucking floor in.  Really?  And it drops down, I think, 15 stories as you're taking a shit. 
[02:52:00]  Would you be able to go in that bathroom?  No.  Could you walk out glass?  Wait, wait, Opie, what are you saying?  It takes...  Say that again.  Did I fuck it up?  No, no, no, no.  I just didn't hear you.  You know the CN Tower in Toronto where you can walk on the floor?  Yes, okay.  And it creeps you the fuck out?  Yeah.  That I could barely do.  There's a guy who remodeled an apartment in New York City.  There it is.  It's an old elevator shaft.  Oh, wow.  Or like a garbage chute or something.  And he put his bathroom in that area of his apartment. 
[02:52:30]  And then put a glass fucking...  That's amazing.  ...floor in.  So I thought when I read the article, it drops like 15 stories or something like that.  Maybe 10.  I don't know.  I could do that.  What does it say?  It's a long way.  That's great.  Could you do that?  15 stories.  Yes.  15 stories.  You're looking down as you're on the...  It's in Mexico, though.  The whole bathroom.  I could do that.  I thought it was in the city.  They probably never let you.  Guadalajara.  God, I gotta start reading.  I thought they were...  I thought you told me the CN Tower has a new fucking...  You can go outside of it now.  That's...  Yeah.  I couldn't do that.  You can go outside on fucking ropes.  I couldn't do it.  What? 
[02:53:00]  Where...  It's in Toronto.  It's...  I could do that.  Fuck no, dude.  They go around the top and they're tethered.  Well, you...  Yeah, well...  I could do that.  You can jump off the stratosphere.  My ex did it.  I couldn't do that.  That I couldn't do.  No.  This I could do, though.  I'd do that if somebody paid me to do it.  How much?  I don't know.  It'd have to be...  Would you do it out of onus?  Huh?  Nothing.  What'd you say?  Nothing.  Would you do it out of onus?  No.  Nothing. 
[02:53:30]  We're good.  I'm gonna fucking mush that yogurt right in your face.  Why?  Yeah, you don't even know what I said.  That's true.  It could have been really nice.  You...  Nothing...  It could have been really nice, Bobby.  Nothing nice comes out of your mouth.  I said a nice thing there.  It's too bad you don't listen.  It's too bad you don't listen.  No, you didn't.  I sure did.  No, you didn't.  Here it is.  Would you do this?  No, I wouldn't even...  I can't even look at that.  Why?  You're tethered.  Doesn't matter.  That would fucking matter.  I wouldn't be happy about it.  Tenth and third.  Oh.  I could do that.  Oh.  Will you stop touching me?  I'm actually standing next to you looking.  Would you walk out in the Grand Canyon with that glass thing they have? 
[02:54:00]  Fudge that.  No.  It's a big semicircle or something?  I've been to the Grand Canyon.  I...  So have I, Bobby.  But you didn't do the thing.  Well, it wasn't a competition twat face.  I was just saying I went.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Well, how bad do you have to relate that?  You just say you were at the Grand Canyon, too.  I'm talking about the thing.  Did you do the thing I'm talking about?  I didn't finish.  I was in the middle of the sentence.  I went to the Grand Canyon.  I had a hard time walking down the fucking trail.  Why? 
[02:54:30]  Why are you laughing at all?  I thought you were nice.  Oh, shit.  Tum shake.  That's how we celebrate a joke in this room.  Why can't you walk down the trail?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bobby, look.  Look what he's doing.  He's hanging off the back.  Wow, that would be tough.  Yeah, you're fucked.  Dude, the back of his feet.  That'd be tough.  He's tethered to the top of the building.  That would be tough to do.  He's fucking leaning back over the abyss, man.  I didn't know they leaned like that.  Dude, that's what you do. 
[02:55:00]  Look at this guy.  That's exactly.  Oh, fuck off.  You see how he's going to the edge?  Oh, man.  That would be tough to do.  Oh, look at how fucking high that is.  Dude, that's the height of the Trade Center.  That's over.  That's like 1,100 feet or something.  It's terrible.  Look at her.  I would never do that.  It used to be.  I'm not sure if it still is the highest North American structure.  Dude, I wouldn't even walk out on the outside there.  I'd be afraid the wind would just blow the whole roof off.  Isn't the New World, what is it, the New World Trade Center?  Freedom Tower.  The third tallest building in America. 
[02:55:30]  I thought that was going to be the tallest in New York, third in America.  What's got it?  The Sears Tower?  Third in the world.  No way, third in the world.  No way.  Third in America.  Taipei Tower is much taller.  I think it's in Thailand.  Third in America, then.  The Burj Khalif is much taller, and that's in Dubai.  What is that, a bird?  It's an airplane.  Where?  It brushed.  The wing hit the CN Tower.  It just brushed it, though.  Everyone's all right.  What else is high buildings? 
[02:56:00]  Could you imagine that if a fucking plane?  Sears Tower is that big?  Yeah, it's the biggest in the country, I believe.  No, I know it is, but I mean, is it?  The John Hancock building is right behind it, too.  Is Sears Tower number one?  That's a plane?  Yeah.  It's an airplane.  I thought that was a bird.  Notice all those people are very young, too, by the way.  So?  Yeah, there's no old fucking people.  What are the tallest buildings in the world, Sam?  I don't think we have the top five.  Why can't you do it as an old guy?  I would never go out there.  Your adventure years are over?  That's stupid.  No, it's not that.  It's just, it's stupid.  It does nothing.  It does nothing. 
[02:56:30]  Why would you do that?  It gives you an adventurous spirit.  Yeah, then you all have lunch together and go, holy fuck, can you believe it?  You'd be the fear.  You know, you're talking about stuff.  We have lunch?  Mm-hmm.  What's tallest?  Birds Khalif, right?  Or someone from another part of the country, you know.  We'll give tallest buildings.  This must be old.  Which one is it?  Where is it?  What is it now?  I thought the, uh, the new...  Taipei, Shanghai.  Look at how much...  Is Taipei number two?  Yeah.  Look at how much bigger a bird is.  The bird's tower is fucking massive. 
[02:57:00]  The bird's tower just gets to 800 meters, and Taipei is...  I don't know meters.  I don't live in a world of meters.  I hate meters.  300 meters.  What is that?  What's a meter?  0.62 or something?  It's what you do after you talk to her.  Or what?  You meet her.  What is a meter?  Oh, after you...  You'd meet her before you talk to her.  Oh, I messed up.  What is a meter, Sam?  Um, I don't know what the...  Where's the Empire State Building?  Oh, okay.  So 800 meters is 2,600 feet.  That's how high that fucking thing is. 
[02:57:30]  That building is a half a mile high?  Dude, it's twice the height of...  It's like both towers of the World Trade Center stacked on top of each other.  2,600 feet is a half a mile.  I mean, second place is 1,600 feet.  Does that mean running around a track twice?  That's how tall the building is?  It's 1,000 feet taller than the second taller building.  Here's what it is.  And again, I keep saying Trade Center.  It's the only relatable building I can think of.  There's about 1,000 feet.  If you stack the Taipei Tower with the Trade Center on top of it, that's the Burj Khalif.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I have to go to Dubai.  We have to go there.  They have a chair at the top, too. 
[02:58:00]  At the very...  That's not a chair?  I know what you...  No!  You're not supposed to sit on those.  But people go out...  You can go up there and sit there.  It's crazy.  One person can sit up there.  Yeah, but they...  No, you could have a couple.  The things you're thinking of are right on the very top of the radio tower type thing.  And they're these weird things that they're like...  You can't sit in them, but there's like four or five of them around.  You want to show him...  Can you show...  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  That's the...  Then you're in outer space.  That's from the top.  You're in outer space.  That's the thing I'm talking about right there.  Yeah, you're standing. 
[02:58:30]  You can stand right on the tippity-tippity side.  No, there's more than that.  Go to the one where they're sitting, Sam.  There's ones that are braver than that.  Oh, yeah.  We're looking at the guy in the very top of the tower.  There you go.  That's it, yeah.  Look, they're sitting on the edge.  And they're not holding on.  They're not holding on to anything.  Oh, fuck you, man.  Oh, they're barely holding on to that antenna thing.  I don't...  I don't like it.  They're holding on.  They are sitting at 2,600 feet.  My favorite video when it comes to heights is the kid that is doing the pull-ups.  Can you find that?  Bobby, you want to see something freaked out? 
[02:59:00]  You think you can find it?  It's not as tall as this, obviously.  A guy decides to do pull-ups.  And he's not attached to anything.  Is this the one?  No, that might not be.  Oh, this might be.  Yeah.  Watch this.  Oh, my God.  This will horrify you.  This will horrify you.  Put it on the Facebook page.  We haven't had it up there in a while.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Watch.  He's not attached to anything, Bob.  He's now hanging and doing pull-ups. 
[02:59:30]  Watch.  He's got to be...  Does he fall?  Does he fall?  He's got to be...  I think he's about 500 feet off the ground, I would guess.  500 feet.  Just doing pull-ups.  You know you get tired when you do pull-ups.  What would happen if you can't do that last pull-up?  You'd manage.  Or you'd fall.  Look at these guys.  Look at your hand slipped.  And it's a big bar.  It's a big bar.  Look at the guy's almost stepping on his fucking hands.  Yeah, look at that.  He can't even get up.  I would so fucking lose it.  This guy is dangling above thin air. 
[03:00:00]  It's about 500 feet, I think.  Does he die?  Does he fucking die, guys?  I'm sure.  If he dies, I'm going to flip out, man.  Please don't show me this.  Out of all these villains?  I don't want to get desensitized to this shit.  No, he doesn't go.  I don't want to...  He goes.  He doesn't go, Bob.  He fucking goes.  Keep looking.  He doesn't go.  No, he doesn't go.  He doesn't go.  He fucking goes.  If this guy doesn't fall to his death, then this show is fucking just a shark.  That's on the end of a fucking crane.  That's a big crane.  No, he lives.  They all live.  How many feet do you think that is? 
[03:00:30]  It could be 800 feet.  Does it say?  It might say.  I would guess 300 to 500, somewhere in that range.  I'd higher than 300 feet, dude.  Is it?  Yeah.  500 feet, call it.  Doesn't say.  Out of all those videos that we watch from time to time, that's the most horrifying one for  me right there.  That is horrifying.  What about this one?  That one's pretty bad, too.  What is this?  Oh, these are people going out.  They're scooting out onto the...  They're probably all Russians.  They're crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  The edge of a giant...  I can't see how high.  This guy is fucking insane.  But this kid decides to just walk out. 
[03:01:00]  It's a giant beam.  This one's pretty bad, too.  Hanging over trees, but it's probably...  He almost fell right there.  You see that?  He had to grab himself.  That's got to be close to 1,000 feet.  And now he's like scooting out, just scooting out onto the edge of a beam.  Beams about, I don't know, 20 feet.  Bobby, look.  And now he just stands at the end of it.  Does he fall?  Does he fall?  No.  And they're not tethered or anything.  Bobby's holding my sweatshirt.  Doesn't that make...  My palms are sweating.  Yeah.  Yeah, mine are, too.  I'm not even kidding. 
[03:01:30]  I think the hardest things to watch are the ones we've watched before.  Oh, my God.  Alan Rob Rebert.  Oh, yeah.  The guy who climbs things with no rope.  You've seen him, Bobby, on the buildings?  Yeah, I've seen those guys.  Those are the scariest to me because he has no rope.  Actually, the scariest thing I've ever seen as far as heights go is Philippe.  Yeah, yeah, I agree.  Laying down on the wire between the Twin Towers and just taking it all in.  He's on his back.  This shit scares me more because those guys are professionals.  These are just dumb people going, hey, let's go do this. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, and there's a few guys that obviously thought they were going to make their video  and fucking die.  He's got a backpack on.  I'll bet you...  They don't have any people fall.  I've seen that.  They're somewhere.  Sure.  God, yeah, I've seen those.  What?  Oh, yeah.  People falling through heights.  You want us to show you?  I saw one video recently of a chick who Bundy jumped.  A guy who jumps off a bridge.  She Bundy jumped?  Yeah, no, I missed that.  She killed somebody on the way down?  Yeah, or Alan Pegg jumped.  Dude, don't act like you don't fucking jump on people as soon as they fuck up a word.  I certainly do.  All right.  That's my thing. 
[03:02:30]  Taking my thing.  Sorry, I don't want to take your thing.  No, it was a...  Look at this.  That's my thing.  Where is he?  I got to go, guys.  Where are you going?  I have an...  If you go, I go.  We have to leave because I have an appointment.  Yeah, I got to go.  He's the guy that just climbs the sides of buildings without anything.  All he has is chalk on his hands to keep him dry.  Yeah, but he also weighs like fucking 50 pounds, right?  He climbed the...  One time he used ropes was the fucking Burge Tower, but they made him or they wouldn't  let him do it.  How far did he go?  The whole thing. 
[03:03:00]  No way.  I don't know.  As high as you can go, but he had rope, but he didn't use it, but it was a safety rope.  Holy shit.  But you know that that was not his idea.  He did the Taipei...  Look at him.  L.A. and Robert Clyde's the Taipei building.  There's horrifying footage because there's a giant...  It looks like a big ball on the top of it, and he had to navigate and climb under,  hanging upside down to go around.  It's fucking terrible.  It's terrible.  People hate the tallest building argument because of the antennas they put on top to  make him the tallest. 
[03:03:30]  Well, yeah, but I mean, the Burge is still a high...  It's still...  You have to judge it some way.  I gotta go.  Listen, I'll see you guys tomorrow.  I'll see you later.  It was good seeing you, Bobby.  Of course, open young Sam.  Good seeing you.  Good seeing you, brother.  It's been a while.  Yes, sir.  I just...  I got an apnea of people coming to my house at 1040.  All right.  So, I have to be there for that.  So, my nose is still stuffy.  I had this procedure done recently where I had my turbinate shrunk.  Say turbinates again.  I said it twice last time.  I fucking hate it. 
[03:04:00]  Why?  He just loves saying the word.  It's a good word to have.  This person's going to be called that.  What is it?  What's it going to be called?  Turbinates.  Turbinates.  Turbinates.  Turbinates.  Turbinates.  Turbinates.  These glasses are so dark, it's like I'm going for the sun.  Here's a question, Bob Kelly.  What's the most important holiday?  Fucking Mother's Day.  Oh, you screwed me up.  Damn it!  You're not supposed to say Mother's Day.  That's the big reveal.  Christmas.  Nope.  Halloween.  Why don't you say Turkey Day or something? 
[03:04:30]  You cock sucker.  Martin Luther King Day.  Nope.  All right.  Keep guessing.  My birthday.  Nope.  Nobody gives a fuck about your birthday.  Hope you die on it or something.  Hanukkah.  Hanukkah.  It's got to be Hanukkah.  Nope.  Ramadan.  Nope.  What?  You have to guess.  You can say Mother's Day.  Mother's Day.  Mother's Day.  Damn it!  Do you like your mom?  I love my mom.  I do.  I love...  We've been through a lot...  We've been through a lot...  We've been through... 
[03:05:00]  We've been through a lot of stuff, but I love my mom.  Yeah, you've got to love your mom.  Well, you better make sure she knows you love her.  How do I do that?  Depends on who we're reading the live read for right now.  I told her that I love her.  Is that enough?  You don't want to do flowers.  That's dumb.  Really?  Don't do flowers?  No.  What do I do?  Chocolate stuff.  Come on.  What do I do?  Seriously.  Well, I was going to get her flowers, but maybe have her some chocolate strawberries.  Last hour, you get her flowers.  This hour, flowers, not a good idea.  What do you do with this now? 
[03:05:30]  This hour, you look at some fucking gold-dipped roses and some pendants from Steven Singer.  Oh, dude.  Oh, yeah.  That's what you do.  I like those.  There's some kind of, like, mother...  I'm going to try to do this, Sam.  Yeah?  Without reading it.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You could do, like, a mother-kid pendant.  Mother-kid pendant?  From Steven Singer.  That's great.  I think it's $239.  Sam?  Pendant? 
[03:06:00]  I mean, I thought you were talking about roses.  Oh.  Now, why don't you just read the thing?  Wait a minute.  Hold on, Bobby.  Be right back with you.  I thought you were going to wing it.  Yeah, but I got to...  I thought you were going to wing it.  You know what, Bobby?  What?  You're right.  I'm right what?  I'm going to wing it.  All right.  Wing it.  So it's about roses.  The dip roses.  12 carrots.  That's a lot of carrots.  No, it's not.  It's more than 12.  It is to me.  I don't really eat carrots.  24 carrots. 
[03:06:30]  Bobby, hold on a minute.  I thought you were going to wing it.  I'm going to wing it.  24-carat gold-dipped roses.  That's a lot of carrots.  And they got lots of different colors to choose from.  They got a...  Ooh, I like the purple one.  They got purple.  I like the baby blue one was nice.  They got a bluish one.  Oh, the yellow rose.  They got a black one, I think.  Ooh, they got a classic gold rose.  Hold on, Bobby.  I thought you were going to wing it. 
[03:07:00]  You know what, Bobby?  What?  I'm going to wing it.  They got a peach rose.  Peach is good.  I said that.  And the 24...  Carrots.  Yeah.  Gold-dipped rose.  I like that.  I like that too, Bobby.  The violet rose is sold out, though.  They are.  Sold out.  But you know what?  The baby blue one, which I kind of like better, is available.  Baby blue.  Yeah.  And they're only $25.  $25 per rose. 
[03:07:30]  No.  It's gold.  Gold is very expensive right now.  Hold on a minute.  Gold is really up there.  They are...  I thought you were going to wing it.  You know what, Bobby?  You're right.  What?  I'm going to wing it.  Good.  $69 a piece.  A little more.  Just a little bit.  $69.  $95. 
[03:08:00]  I thought you were going to...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Opie.  Yeah.  I thought you were going to wing it.  Like, just wing it, dude.  God damn it, Bobby.  You're right.  $69 even.  No, not even.  Because Steven Singer likes that 69 number.  I see what he's getting at.  What?  It's not even.  What?  Oh, God.  Just to end it.  What's wrong?  What's wrong with you?  Stop talking about these roses.  What?  No, I'm going to go with $69. 
[03:08:30]  Okay.  How do they get them?  Well, I'm glad you asked.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Great website.  And you can see the roses for yourself.  I have one.  You have a rose?  I gave it to my wife two years ago.  I got one.  She likes it?  She still has it.  Loves it, right?  Still has it.  Of course she still has it, because it's not a rose rose.  A rose that dies within a week.  That's stupid.  It's dipped in gold.  Dipped in gold.  It's in a vase.  In a vase.  Forever.  And I believe it comes with one of those personalized gift cards. 
[03:09:00]  I don't have that.  Where you write a little note.  She don't have that.  IHateStevenSinger.com or...  You call it.  Yeah, there's a number.  Um...  1-888.  I thought you were going to wing it.  You know what?  Right.  You're right about this, Bobby. 
[03:09:30]  1-888.  I don't need the paper.  IHateStevenSinger.  That's it.  1-888.  IHateStevenSinger.  That's it.  Roses for Mother's Day.  Great thing, because you know what?  It doesn't go away.  They don't get to eat them or they don't die.  True.  True that.  It's forever.  True that.  It's kind of the best of both worlds.  I'm promoting my Instagram today.  Ooh.  Big fan of Instagram.  I like the Instagram.  I posted a picture.  It's fucking doing really well. 
[03:10:00]  How many things?  I don't know.  He says it right there.  How many comments?  How many likes?  You know exactly.  What thing am I looking at?  Likes.  You know you're nervous.  Ah, fuck the likes.  I want to know how many views.  Yeah, that's likes.  164 people have seen the picture?  That's this?  That's not views.  That's likes.  Those are likes.  I don't like likes.  I want views.  How do you?  You can't look at views.  I want views.  You can't.  They don't have views on Instagram.  I don't like that.  Well, you don't always know what you like.  Somebody overnight, a fine fan, and I wish I could give you credit. 
[03:10:30]  I will maybe later.  It's a Daily News cartoon from 2007.  I saw that.  I didn't see this when it first came out.  And it's two guys walking on the street, on the sidewalk, and there's a guy in the street  with his ear to a sewer, like a manhole cover.  Mm-hmm.  And the guys walking by go, probably listening to Opie and Anthony.  I didn't know we made the big time with a fucking cartoon.  I think we talked about it on the show before.  Ah, see, I don't remember shit.  Yeah.  It's not that important to me.  I guess not.  What's your Instagram name? 
[03:11:00]  I can't say.  I thought you were promoting it.  Oh, yeah.  Opie Radio.  One word.  Thank you, Bobby.  You're welcome.  Because if I did, it would look fucking cheap.  Right.  I could plug and, you know.  Yeah, it'd be like me going, I'm going to be in Kansas City improv, and not this week,  next week.  Really?  Yeah.  How do they, like, find out more about that?  You go to robertkellylive.com, and to the right side of my website, there's all these  dates, so you can go to Laugh Stub.  I'm going to be all over the place.  Upstate New York, I'm finally going to Rochester. 
[03:11:30]  I set that up.  What?  Mm-hmm.  You set up a date for me?  I didn't know that, really?  Yeah.  How?  I take care of you guys.  Sometimes you don't even know.  Really?  But then I had to say it again, see?  Fuck!  Yeah, you ruined it.  I did set that up for you.  Did you really?  Want to give me a little kickback?  No.  I'm going to give you a kickback.  You're a nice guy.  What?  You're not getting a kickback from...  You should have set it up better.  Well, that wasn't up to me, but I set it up.  No.  That's Brother Wee's turrets.  Trust me, I set that up.  I'm going up...  I'm not even joking.  I'm going to do some fly fishing up there. 
[03:12:00]  Hey, you know what?  What?  That dude from...  Rich.  No, I know.  I like Rich, but that other dude went fly fishing and he didn't invite us.  I thought he was inviting us.  I forgot his name.  Trump or something.  Oh, you mean Trump Jr.?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy.  He went, what?  What the fuck?  Why would he invite us?  Because he said on the show.  He didn't.  He absolutely did.  No, we kept pushing it.  And then he had pictures of him fly fishing.  Yeah, no.  We kept saying, hey, take us up. 
[03:12:30]  And he kept going, huh?  What?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think he kind of invited us.  I remember...  I think he said he was going to get back to us.  He didn't invite us.  We invited ourselves and he kind of just nodded his head and then tried to take a picture  with Anthony and Jim.  Like, yeah, guys, let's take a photo.  Let me get the fuck out of here.  Well...  And me and you were trying to push him into that fucking committing.  So we're not going to get the invite?  No.  I think we're stuck at the other hotel.  Come on.  I hear he's got a nice little river house.  He's got a beautiful house.  Really?  I actually have...  How's this?  I have a house up there. 
[03:13:00]  A friend of mine just bought a place on a river.  Can we go?  Yeah.  Why don't we go now?  Well...  Holy fuck.  That plug really worked.  What?  I just got 15 more likes.  Really?  I mean, we have a lot of people listening to the show.  I didn't think this was news.  Dude, fucking 10 more people started following my Instagram, Opie Radio.  Really?  There's more than 10 people.  How many people do you have?  Oh, not a lot because I'm late to the game.  I fucked myself.  How many people do you get on there? 
[03:13:30]  Only like 6,000.  That's a lot.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm late to the game.  I should have done...  Well, I had to wait because I didn't have an iPhone.  I have...  I joined when I could.  Jeez, I just got 27 likes.  On what?  On a photo.  Fuck.  Oh.  My Instagram name is not Sam.  Sam.  Wait, nobody asked you.  You do that on the after show.  This isn't about you right now.  This is still my show.  This is about me and fucking Opie.  You guys are right.  I shouldn't have mentioned not Sam.  And if you want to see a video...  Yes, I re-edited it, but it was worth it. 
[03:14:00]  I got a video of a creepy guy with a golf ball sticking out of his head taking pictures of models.  This is some avant-garde shit that I filmed.  People don't even...  It's avant.  Avant.  It's not avant.  Avant.  Avant.  Avant-garde shit.  You got an old guy who looks like Einstein with a golf ball sticking out of his head.  He's got a fucking disposable camera, and he's taking pictures of models two feet from their fucking face. 
[03:14:30]  Who films that shit?  Is that on your YouTube?  On Opie?  Yeah, I don't need to promote that today, though.  I just wanted to know where it was.  It's Opie Radio, by the way.  Opie Radio.  Yeah, but don't promote it, please.  What?  Don't promote Opie Radio?  And then I'm making fun of it.  I would never promote it.  Why would I promote it?  That's like me promoting fucking you-know-what-dude on Riotcast.com.  Tomorrow we doing it?  You want to do it tomorrow?  I don't think we're doing it tomorrow.  Next Tuesday.  Next Tuesday, me and Bobby.  Next Tuesday.  Podcasting.  That's what we do.  But I like this video because I took some scenes from an old video that didn't do that well, 
[03:15:00]  and I put this guy front and center.  I think it's going to do well.  Well, creepy golf ball head guy and models.  And then I make fun of the models as they're walking by, asking them if they're models.  That's funny.  You don't have the balls to do that.  I don't.  You need a certain disconnect from humanity to be you and get good videos.  What happened?  You really need to be desensitized.  I'm playing the part.  He didn't even know.  Yeah.  I was disconnected there.  I was actually playing my part of being connected by going forward.  Ouch.  You're like a real actor. 
[03:15:30]  I am.  How's that show going?  NYC 2-2, Sunday nights at 10 o'clock.  Is it doing well?  It's actually fucking doing well, but not with...  I think they're...  Holy fuck!  I just got 27 more fucking Instagram followers.  That's great.  It's not impressive.  8 million views.  Dude, that's pretty impressive.  8 million viewers last night.  Not based on the amount of people.  That's pretty good.  8 million?  8 point something million.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  You're funny in it, Bobby.  Thanks.  I watch.  Oh, cool.  I'm in it very little, but...  I actually fast forward to your scenes. 
[03:16:00]  I do, too.  Because I can't watch shows right now.  Too busy.  Got things going on.  I got something else coming out soon.  I mean, I got some fucking big shit happening.  So do I.  No, I mean some...  So do I.  I mean legitimately some fucking great shit.  So do I.  Like huge.  So do I.  You write yours down, and I'll write mine down.  Okay.  I think we have a guest.  What?  I think we have a guest.  Who?  Chaz Palminteri. 
[03:16:30]  Is he coming in?  Yeah.  No, I don't want to talk to Chaz.  Well, you shouldn't have done the read for so long, then.  You ready?  No, you have to.  Oh, you want me to do mine?  I did mine.  Bring Chaz in.  Right?  What are you talking about this for?  Do you want it?  You want it?  Go.  Go.  Hold on.  I got my...  I got my...  Write it.  I got...  Just keep going.  Go, go.  Write it down.  Don't write...  Don't read mine.  I'm not going to read mine.  You don't read mine.  I promise.  All right, let's go.  No, I really promise.  Let's go.  Oh, but I already read Bob's, so if you want, I'll just tell you what his says.  Don't read either one. 
[03:17:00]  Let's see who gets a bigger reaction.  Okay?  Don't read either one.  Me and Bobby have big fucking things happening to us.  Okay.  Ready?  I read Bob's.  All right.  Ready?  Ow!  Don't read.  I just punched Sam's ankle.  Did you hear that?  All right, ready?  You promise?  Yep.  Let's go.  Ready?  Way too big.  Let's go.  Wow.  I told you I'd blow you away. 
[03:17:30]  Ah, you just spit.  That's fucking good.  Did you see it?  Did you see it?  It's phlegm.  I saw Bob's.  It's phlegm.  You didn't see Obie's?  I couldn't from here.  I told you I'd blow yours away.  Yours is pretty good, too, though.  Yeah, but yours is a...  I'd say Obie's is a bigger game changer.  Shut up.  I saw them both.  Where is it, Bobby?  You made me spit up phlegm.  I mean, ugh.  Don't say anything.  I do don't say nothing, because it's not happening yet.  It's very early stages.  I know secrets about both of you. 
[03:18:00]  I know secrets.  I actually have another one, too.  Bobby, watch this.  I take this home with me.  That's how big my news is.  I threw mine in the garbage can, because people...  It doesn't matter.  How are you guys going to keep my mouth shut?  By fucking doing this?  No, no, no.  Okay, I won't say anything.  Remember I talked about the mob earlier?  Have fun.  Yeah.  Good luck with that.  I'll see you later.  You're not going to stick around for Chaz?  No, you guys talk to Chaz.  Chaz is a cool guy.  Chaz is the best.  You can stick around if you want, Bobby.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Sam, did I promote all my shit good? 
[03:18:30]  Everything.  You just opened radio on everything.  Oh, and I tapped out on Twitter.  It finally happened.  What do you mean you tapped out?  You're done?  Yeah, no more followers.  I'm done.  You're not done.  Just short of 125,000, I'm done.  I would like all the people that follow me that don't like me to unfollow me today.  Yeah.  Don't you, too.  I would like the people that follow me because they just follow me for dumber...  That don't like me.  Just unfollow me today.  Please.  Big fucking things.  All right.  Hopefully, Ann will be back tomorrow.  I don't know what's going on.  I really want to know if he really has the whooping cough. 
[03:19:00]  I really would like to know that.  Oh, Chaz is here.  Now it's awkward.  Come on in.  I got to go, though.  Come on in.  No, he's coming in right now.  You talk to Chaz, Bob.  Yeah.  Welcome in.  Let me go around.  Go around.  Go around.  All right.  Right on.  How are you doing?  Chaz, how are you, buddy?  Nice to see you, Robert.  How are you, Sam?  How are you doing?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Are we still in the air, right?  Yeah, we're going to go on now. 
[03:19:30]  Why would you have...  Are we going on now?  Yeah, we're on.  Dead air.  Eric, we're on?  You're on.  We're on.  Okay, we're ready to go.  Chaz, Paul, and Terry.  Well, Opie.  Bobby.  Yeah.  I got to tell you something.  Okay, hang on.  Okay, Bobby, you're going.  Chaz, Paul, and Terry's hanging out.  I promise.  It's in the office.  How are you doing, man?  All right, good.  Welcome to this.  This is how we do things here.  It's a little pull the curtain back for how we do it in some people.  That's all right.  I can roll with it. 
[03:20:00]  Okay, okay.  We were talking about you earlier today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know if you remember, but Opie was married in Philadelphia three years ago, and  you stopped by the wedding.  I remember that, yes.  He was worried.  That's why he didn't want to say anything to you while you were here, because he was  worried that you wouldn't remember.  I do remember.  And it would be uncomfortable.  But, yeah, it was an enormous wedding.  Yeah.  I mean, I couldn't believe it when I walked in.  Yeah, and certainly highlighted by your brief cameo.  It was a great wedding.  Yeah.  Have you been to a lot of Hollywood weddings? 
[03:20:30]  Not a lot, but a bunch.  Do you remember anybody specifically having an over-the-top?  Because, like, I'm getting married in a month or so, and, like, you know, my fiancÃ© realizes  that our wedding will not come close to Opie's wedding.  Right, right, right, right.  What are some of the...  It's hard for me to say, because they're friends of mine.  Right.  You don't want to blow up their spots.  Exactly.  I get what you're saying.  They might say, Chaz, what are you doing?  Bob, you just... 
[03:21:00]  Chaz, why?  Because Bobby didn't remember, didn't believe that you were at Opie's wedding.  I was.  Were you just randomly walking by?  I was, yes, and I said, and just walked, and it was...  Yeah.  It was him.  I couldn't believe it.  That's crazy.  Yeah, and he just stopped in and he said, hey, can you imagine how cool that would be,  though, if it's, like, your wedding reception, and it's beautiful, first of all.  You have this...  It was a beautiful wedding.  Yeah, the wedding's beautiful.  And I don't know if you know this, but they actually got married in the Sixth Sense church  that they used in that movie.  I didn't know that.  No, that I didn't know. 
[03:21:30]  So all this is going on, and then Chaz Palmitari walks in, just wanted to say congratulations,  saw you partying.  That's surreal.  It's amazing.  Don't flip me out.  But you're here to talk about A Mighty Fine.  I've seen the movie.  It's a small movie.  It's launching just in New York and L.A.  Just in New York, yeah.  A few places.  On the 25th of May.  And it takes place in the 70s.  It's a family from Brooklyn, and they're moving down south.  You play the father of this family who, like, I found myself, I was sympathetic to him, but 
[03:22:00]  at the same time, I couldn't stand him because you could see every mistake he was making as  he went along.  Yeah, like in the 70s, you know, they really didn't talk about this rage issue, you know,  this bipolar or rage issue or whatever it could be, you know.  That's why it's important.  That's why I'm doing some press on it, because I think you could shed a light on that thing  that, you know, even if you don't hit your wife, you could still do physically abuse  by being, you know, making them walk on eggs, you know. 
[03:22:30]  Is that what made you want to do this, that you thought it kind of, like, that maybe just  being rageful without actually getting physical is a problem in your family, you think so?  Not in my family, no.  No, I mean, the proverbial you're, not you specifically.  I've seen it, I've seen it, and people kind of hushed them out by it, you know, oh, don't  say nothing, dad's okay, you know, and dad's not okay.  Yeah, I mean, there were a couple of scenes that I had to laugh at.  The, you, you, your character chasing your daughter's friends out of the pool in the 
[03:23:00]  way in which you did, taking it out of reality was hilarious.  I mean, I don't want to spoil it, but, you know.  Where did you find the movie?  Like, where did, or where did they find you?  How did you come across it?  They actually just called me and said they thought that I would be perfect for this.  I read it, and I really liked it a lot, and I just, I just felt that it was a character  that I never, I've never done before, so I said, yeah, Andy, Andy McDowell was going 
[03:23:30]  to play my wife, and I always, always wanted to work with her, and so it worked out perfect.  Yeah.  Now, obviously, when you first became known for A Bronx Tale.  Yeah.  And before it was a movie, it was the one-man show, and then you brought it back for the  one-man show.  Do you like...  Which I saw, by the way.  You saw, oh, you saw, I never got to see the one-man show.  I saw it the last time you brought it back.  Oh, okay.  It was, uh, it was amazing.  It was great.  It was great.  The energy that you had, because I didn't know what to expect, because I know the movie. 
[03:24:00]  Right.  It's usually the other way around.  You see the play first, or you read the book first, and then you see the movie.  Right.  To see the, to know the movie and have it be so that's what it is, you're kind of like,  ah, is this going to, is this going to fuck up?  Is the movie going to fuck this up, or is this going to fuck the movie up?  But actually, this was before the movie.  Yeah, it was before the movie.  Before the movie.  And I was, it was unbelievable, because I didn't know how he was going to pull it off.  I know how the movie goes.  Right.  How is he going to pull that, this, bring it all together?  It was incredible.  Because most people were like, Bob, nobody, like, people didn't realize that you had 
[03:24:30]  started the thing as a one-man show.  As a one-man show, that's correct, yes.  Was it weird when you started doing that, because it's loosely based on your life, you  say, right?  More than loosely.  Yeah.  Quite a bit, yeah.  So, is that a weird thing, bringing people, like, these people who, because everybody  has got a favorite scene in A Bronx Tale, and these iconic scenes are actually moments  of your life that people now kind of carry with them.  Absolutely.  Is that a strange thing for you to live through?  Not really.  No?  I, you know, I get a kick out of it when people, I get on a plane and the pilot shuts 
[03:25:00]  the door and I hear them say, now you just can't leave, you know?  Or I, you know, I walk down the street, somebody else, hey, Chaz, throw them in the bathroom  and things like that.  I don't know.  I get a kick out of it, sure.  I don't know if you read this, but Mike Tyson is now also doing a one-man show.  And, like, the reason that I thought was interesting was because all the news articles, because  he did, I guess, a few nights in Vegas.  He came to see my show.  Well, and he's saying now, or his people are saying, that they're modeling it after 
[03:25:30]  your model.  Like, they specifically said, well, we want to take the Mike Tyson show and do what Chaz  did.  Well, yeah, well, he was very nice, Mike.  He came to see the show and he loved it and he came to see it again with his people and  they were very complimentary and I wish them much success.  And he's a very interesting guy and I think he's got a great story to tell.  Yeah.  Well, speaking of stories, it seems a lot of your stories are based in New York. 
[03:26:00]  Why do you think New York is a place that so many stories can be told?  Like, why do you think the people all have these stories that everybody can relate to?  Because I think there's a melting pot of all these people here and then New York sensibility  is funny.  And Michigan's boring.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I don't know if you say that.  It's just that it's just New York.  Strange things happen in New York that you just go, how did that happen?  You know, I was walking down. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, this is years ago, many years ago.  I'll never forget it.  I was walking down the street and a guy was walking by me and he had a stack of pancakes  on his head with butter right on top.  And he just walked right by me.  And I was just like, and nobody's looking at it.  Everybody else is just living about their life.  I said, where else can I see something like that?  A guy's walking by with a stack of pancakes.  But you can see that somewhere else, but the fact that he can walk by and nobody gives  a shit, what makes it New York?  Right.  That nobody's, there's not a crowd around him trying to, people are like, I gotta go.  I'm trying to get somewhere. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, it was just like an amazing thing.  You still live in New York?  Yeah.  I live upstate.  Upstate?  Yeah, about 40, I live in Westchester.  I live about 40 minutes.  Westchester?  I too live, I live in Scarsdale.  Okay.  I'm a little father.  I'm in Bedford.  Okay, okay.  He's in a nice area.  And it's not with his parents.  I don't live with my parents, but I do.  It was in Scarsdale, it was beautiful.  I mean, I'm on the sort of East Chester-y border.  I'm not quite in that nice, beautiful area of Scarsdale.  Yeah, Scarsdale's beautiful.  But it is a nice area.  So what put you in the suburbs then? 
[03:27:30]  I went to children.  You know, when I started having kids, I just thought, you know, it's time to build a house,  get some land, and, you know, have kids.  How many kids do you have?  Two.  You have two kids?  Yeah, two, boy and a girl, yes.  How old are they?  One 16, one 10.  Oh, really?  Yes, yes.  How great would it be to have Chaz as your dad?  I was just thinking the same thing.  How great would it be to just have a cool dad?  Yeah.  Well, how awful would it be, though, when the girls bring home boyfriends?  That wouldn't be too great.  And the boyfriend has to deal with Chaz. 
[03:28:00]  Yes.  I mean, and then the scene, a mighty fine is the movie he's promoting, and in the scene,  like, his daughter in the movie brings home a boyfriend, and he immediately challenges  him to an arm wrestling contest.  Well, my niece, my niece, my niece, Dina, who I love very much, she brought home a guy  once, and I walk in, and he sees me, and he was like, and I walk over to him, and I  says, how are you doing?  I said, you know, you see my niece?  I said, she means a lot to me.  That's all I said.  I said, take care.  That was it.  But everybody sees the guy from A Bronx Tale, and go, okay, I understand. 
[03:28:30]  I get it.  I understand what you mean.  That was it, you know, so he never forgot that.  I guess in those instances, having your life on the screen in A Bronx Tale and stuff like  that makes it a little easier for people to just understand where you're coming from.  I'm actually really, you know, I'm not a tough guy.  I've never been involved in crime.  I'm not in the mafia.  I've never, you know.  Yeah.  So I'm an actor, you know.  That's all I always say.  Yeah, but you look like you could kill somebody.  Like, you have a sleek assassin.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  You know, you can slick your hair back.  And a confidence that is like, yeah, if one of us were to die right now, it'd be you,  not me.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I could handle myself, okay?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  See that right there.  The fact that you slowly, nonchalantly looked over and said those words, that calm me.  Calmly.  Yeah.  That he's not like, he's not describing the actions.  He doesn't have to.  Right.  I can take care of myself.  All right.  Do you like, when you're acting, do you like the idea of the one-man show because it's  more of a challenge?  It's just you on stage engaging the audience? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Or do you like the teamwork of being on the movie set?  I just think that I like both very much.  It's two different things.  It's totally, it's like tennis and baseball.  It's, I enjoy doing the one-man show.  I enjoy doing theater very much.  I just wrote a new play called Human that's going to come to Broadway.  And then I'm very excited by, it's five characters.  And so I'm really excited by that.  And great things are happening.  Just really good things are happening with my life and my career.  So I'm happy.  That's excellent.  Well, A Mighty Fine is opening in New York and L.A. on May 25th. 
[03:30:00]  And Bob, have you, you weren't here when Rich Voss.  I was here.  I was, I was.  You were here when Voss did his acting with jazz?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Do you remember doing that?  Yeah, I remember that, yeah.  They fucked me up because I thought they were kidding.  They were like, and then he walked in and I was like, oh, shit.  I was like so happy I wasn't Voss.  Yeah, I was about to say, but it fucked you up.  Imagine how Voss felt.  Well, Voss is a shitty actor, but even if you're a good actor, that would fuck you up.  You know what I mean? 
[03:30:30]  Like he's the guy.  Yeah, that would, yeah.  It's like, oh my God, the guy.  And it's his words and his, oh.  What?  There's no way to pull that one up.  That's hard to get, yeah, you're right.  Yeah, you walked in, not even, you were tired.  Yeah.  You walked in with glasses on, like, what's up?  Let's do this.  Yeah, they handed you, yeah.  Okay, I'll do it.  No problem.  Sure.  Grab the script.  Let's go.  What is it?  What is the, how do you get into character?  What was Voss, Rich Voss, when he acted with you?  What was he missing?  Because there was such a disconnect between the way you delivered. 
[03:31:00]  Obviously, the first, you know, acting is the first number one rule in acting is relaxation.  And he was not relaxed.  You know, he just wasn't relaxed.  You know, you have to be relaxed.  It's relaxation and listening.  Those are the two most important things in acting.  That's how you react to the other actor, listening.  And so he was so nervous, and he wasn't even listening because he was like, what am I doing here?  So that's why it was a little disconnect.  But, you know, he was terrific.  Look, if he relaxed and I worked with him a little bit, he'd be terrific. 
[03:31:30]  No, he wouldn't.  No.  No.  I don't care if you, De Niro, and Pesci stayed with him for weeks, he would still stink after a three-month course.  It's probably easier when you write it, but when you haven't written the script, how do you, what's your process?  Do you memorize the script?  You have to memorize your lines.  Yeah.  You know the whole, I read the script a lot.  I memorize my lines, and then I just free myself from the lines.  You have to free yourself from the lines.  But you have to know them well enough that once you free yourself. 
[03:32:00]  You have to know them in your head.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, it's like a muscle, you know?  I mean, look, look what you guys do.  You guys are on the air for hours.  You ad lib and do the things.  You know, some people look at that and go, oh, my God, you know, how do you do that?  Yeah, but the minute you pass any of us a script, we're sitting there going, wait for your turn to talk, wait for your turn to talk.  I'm actually good.  I'm on a TV show right now.  Speak for Yourself.  There you go.  I'm on a show right now, CBS.  What show is that?  NYC 2-2.  Yeah.  De Niro, he's producing it.  You know him, right?  Oh, yes.  Whatever. 
[03:32:30]  I know him pretty well.  Jay Rosenthal, those guys?  Yeah.  A little, very little part.  He knows De Niro.  He's producing the show that you're on.  But that doesn't mean you know De Niro.  You don't know him.  I was actually invited to one of the parties that he was going to be at.  Right.  Maybe.  Did you go?  No.  There you go.  I get too nervous around him.  Yeah.  I get too, I'm nervous now.  If you think people get nervous around me, you should see people when they're around him.  Who do you get nervous around?  The only person I've ever gotten nervous, well, there's actually two.  There's two people that, and I've met and worked with all the big stars and everyone, 
[03:33:00]  but the only two people, the one especially, was Frank Sinatra.  Wow.  I couldn't, I got to know him for about, you know, for years, and I went out to dinner  with him and his family, and I was at his house, and every once in a while, I would  always, I would just look at him and go, it's Frank Sinatra.  That's what I was going to say.  Like, with somebody like Sinatra, are you ever able to see him as a fellow human being?  I mean, I was, but there was always that, but every once in a while, I would just, you 
[03:33:30]  know, say, damn.  Yeah, like, remind yourself.  Like, I'm sitting here.  And that, and Elizabeth Taylor.  Elizabeth Taylor.  Yeah, I was over at Elizabeth's house, and, of course, she wanted to do a movie that I've  written, and I had to meet with her, and when she came out, I was like, wow.  Yeah.  All right.  So, you know.  Yeah, that's the only two.  When you are, when you're not completely hands-on with a project as the writer and  all this stuff, when you're just simply acting, is that sort of like a relief to you?  Oh, God, yeah.  That's easy.  Like, you just get to step back and just tell me what to do. 
[03:34:00]  Just, what do you want?  Tell the director, what do you want?  Great, let's do it.  Yeah.  But if I'm directing and producing and I've written it, oh, you know, that's all-consuming.  Do you think you're ever going to do, like, a lot of actors, really good actors are  going to TV now.  I mean, it's not, you know, back in the day, it was either a film actor or a TV actor.  I would do a television, I would do a series in a heartbeat.  Yeah, how great would he be on, like, a CSI or something?  Didn't you do a couple spots on Modern Family recently?  Yes, I was doing Modern Family, yeah, which I love.  And I was doing Rizzoli and Isles.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  That show, too.  I mean, if it was something that I really, really love, yeah, I would do it.  It's hard to find something, but.  Yeah, like a presumed innocent type of show, one of those badass fucking shows they have.  Anything that requires a badass dude, you could do it.  I like those things that are cable.  I kind of lean towards cable.  Yeah, like FX, like edgy.  You could do some things, you know.  You could say asshole.  I like Dexter, I think that's a good show.  Oh, yeah.  Things that are different.  Is that what it is, what Bob Kelly's assuming, that you're looking for a place where you  can say asshole? 
[03:35:00]  Well, I mean, you can get a little edgier than as far as CBS and, yeah.  Or totally opposite all the way to something like a great show like Modern Family, which  I like doing.  Yeah.  It's a wonderful show and really funny.  Yeah.  And it's something.  My daughter loves it and my mom likes it.  Do you find yourself doing things now that you just do because your kids will think it's  cool?  Oh, yeah.  I just did a movie called Oogie Loves Big Adventure.  And that's coming out in Labor Day. 
[03:35:30]  And I've done about four or five movies when my kids are really small.  You know, Stuart Little and...  And just so you can take your kids and be like, hey, hey!  Just so I can tell my kids what I do.  Yeah.  They don't know what daddy did in the beginning.  Right.  Well, you know, hopefully they'll see a mighty fine like everybody else in New York and L.A.  May 25th.  May 25th.  That's correct.  Chaz, thank you for stopping by.  You're very welcome.  We're actually...  We're going to play...  Well, before we go to break, Eric, we'll play a little clip.  Just do the production piece of Chaz and Voss acting together to bring everyone up to 
[03:36:00]  speed on that because we made production pieces.  We never let anybody forget about that.  Where is Voss?  He's around.  Is he...  You know...  He's in Jersey probably.  He was here.  Okay.  I'm playing.  He's in Rosalind's Spaghetti Factory.  But he still comes in all the time.  Go to Voss.com.  He still can't act.  RichVoss.com.  No.  Thank you very much for stopping by, Chaz.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say.  It's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that. 
[03:36:30]  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you.  I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie!  Beans!  I want my money!  A bronc.  Tail.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20.  And it's been two weeks now.  And every time he sees me, he keeps dying to me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian.  Stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor. 
[03:37:00]  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  Cost you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to cheat.  Yeah, you're right, John.  You're always right.  A Bronx tale.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time.  And I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read. 
[03:37:30]  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  The ONA show continues.  Sort of.  This is after ONA Live.  Stay tuned. </pre>
