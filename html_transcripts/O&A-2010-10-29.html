<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts mocking their controversial image and dismissing the World Series as a "bust."  They then speculated on Cablevision's attempts to undercut Fios, suggesting shady deals with building owners.  This segued into a gruesome description of a New York mob-style double murder at a cemetery, focusing on the graphic details of the victims' deaths.  The hosts contrasted this with the Yankees manager receiving a new contract, highlighting the absurdity of the juxtaposition.  The conversation then shifted to a deep dive into Sam Roberts' extensive collection of childhood Halloween costumes, meticulously documented in a photo album by his overbearing mother.  Numerous photos were shown and discussed, featuring Sam in various wrestling and pop culture-themed costumes.  The hosts and Sam poked fun at both the costumes and the mother's obsessive record-keeping, which extended to saving Sam's haircut in a Tupperware containerâ€”a detail that prompted disgust and laughter. A caller even shared a similar story about their own overbearing mother.  The segment concluded with a look at Sam's Cub Scout badges, further highlighting his mother's potentially inflated accounts of his achievements.

The show continued with a bizarre discussion about circumcision and one host's childhood experiences. This transitioned into a story about guest Stevie whose mother, Donna, unexpectedly arrived at the studio at 5 a.m. with donuts.  A significant portion was dedicated to an interview with Katie Featherston, star of *Paranormal Activity 2*.  The conversation covered the film's success, her experiences with fame, and encounters with unpleasant celebrities.  Dan, a former acquaintance and co-worker of Katie Featherston, briefly joined the conversation.  The focus then returned to Stevie, with Donna joining him in the studio. The hosts engaged them in a conversation about Stevie's life, his relationship with his father, his nystagmus, and his radio aspirations.  Donna's post-divorce dating life and anecdotes about Stevie's childhood, including a story about a blow-up doll, were also discussed.  Throughout this segment, the hosts employed vulgar language and made sexually suggestive remarks.

A subsequent segment featured a phone call with Stevie and Donna, focusing on Donna's active social life, much to Stevie's displeasure.  Stevie expressed his disapproval of her drinking and the smell of cigarettes on her.  The hosts teased both Stevie and Donna about their relationship and Donna's dating life.  Studio guest Troy was introduced, and the hosts suggested he date Donna. This ignited a heated discussion, with Stevie vehemently objecting. The banter became increasingly sexually suggestive, with the hosts encouraging Troy to flirt with Donna and even suggesting a lap dance, while Stevie repeatedly interrupted.  Photos of Stevie's younger sisters were shown briefly.  Stevie's habits, including his interest in anime pornography, were also discussed.  Laszlo, promoting a zombie-themed video game add-on, then joined the show. Stevie briefly played the drums in another studio, with mixed results.  The segment concluded with more banter about Donna, Stevie, and Troy, promotion of Laszlo's game, and gifts given to Donna and Stevie, including a sex toy and an anime blow-up doll.  The tone remained highly vulgar and sexually charged.

The final segment recounted a camping trip with Danny, a friend described as out of shape and excessively reliant on his phone.  The hosts detailed Danny's struggles during an eight-mile hike, his constant phone use, and his choice of Bud Light.  Anecdotes about their Korean War-era tent, Danny's exhaustion, and the contrast with the other campers were recounted.  A "Jocktober" segment followed, featuring a retrospective of old Opie and Anthony show clips from their time at WAAF in Boston (1995-1997).  These clips included broadcasts from the Peter Pan Bus Terminal, featuring giveaways and awkward moments, catchphrases like "Mother Hucka," impressions (including a Charlie Brown's parents impression), a prank call to an adult novelty store, and Opie wearing a necklace made from a human finger bone.  Laszlo, the game developer, reacted along with the hosts to these clips, showing varying degrees of amusement and embarrassment. The show concluded with a promotion of a *Red Dead Redemption* zombie DLC.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  It's a fun dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  He's an controversial team  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show  I'm gonna go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Can you just laugh off at the rocking radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Turd, turd, turd, turd, turd, turd, turd  Ha ha, turd  Oh my god 
[00:01:00]  Don't stop tweeting me  Turd  Friday, yes  Liking it  Morning  Or good afternoon if you're hearing this later on in the day  That'll make sense for somebody  What if they hear it at night?  Good evening to everybody listening to this at night  There you go, we got our bases covered 
[00:01:30]  We don't want anyone to feel left out  That's right  I just gotta send a number to Kenny  What happened?  I just gotta send a number to Kenny  Yeah  Yeah  Some World Series, huh?  Wow  Oh my god  162 game season for this shit  Giants are making Texas look like Texas made the Yankees  Oh good  They're blowing them out  9-0  Great  Blowing them out  Not even a game  That's great 
[00:02:00]  And the first game I believe was down something like 20-25%  Yeah  In the ratings from last year  This World Series is a bust already  Yeah  People aren't really like  Psyched for it  No, no, no  That's okay  Because it's time to really get into football and hockey  And maybe a little basketball  Think people are done with baseball?  Most people aren't  Unless your team's in there  Well, yeah 
[00:02:30]  I mean  And then you got, you know  The Giants just kicking the Rangers' ass  Yeah  And kicking Lee's ass  Yeah, kicked his ass  And then they were hitting last night like crazy  The Giants  It was just amazing  Did you watch?  Yeah, yeah  I've been watching  Just, just  You know why I watch?  Because I can  Because I got Fios  Cable vision  So you just want to rub it into everybody  Oh god  I had a  I had a disturbing moment 
[00:03:00]  Then it turned into a fine moment yesterday when I got home  What?  There was a black man coming out from the side of my house  Boo!  But he was in a Verizon uniform  And he was hooking up a neighbor who had had it  Yay!  Yes  So were you in a quandary?  Because it's a black guy  But he's helping somebody out with Fios  I didn't know whether to pat him on the back or shoot him in it  Exactly  I'm kidding, of course  Yes, it was  He said  Somebody wants to, you know, change over 
[00:03:30]  They're tired of this  I go, you must be getting that a lot  He goes, you don't know the half of it  So Cable vision is losing customers over this  All the cable companies are  But I think there's something going on in New York City  Yeah  I think  I don't know for sure  But I was talking to Roland yesterday  And his  Was he sweating?  Yes, of course he was  His landlord refuses to get Fios  What is this?  Is Cable vision and buildings having this thing going on?  I can't prove it 
[00:04:00]  But I've talked to other people in the same type of situation  Where my building will not get Fios  And you wonder, why won't that building get Fios?  Is the cable companies making deals with individual buildings?  That's why they can't pay Fox  It's like, hey, we've got to pay a lot of buildings  Right, but are they going door to door to the Supers  And the people that are running these buildings and making the deals?  You'd think somebody would have said something  You'd think there would have been some building owner that went on  Yeah, I was approached by Cable vision  Yeah, I think it's very, it's just a very gray area 
[00:04:30]  Maybe it's one of the building owners  The guy they found in Queens with a bullet in his head yesterday  Old school mafia shit going down last night, man  We were just talking about that  Old school shit  We were talking about that  Can I give you the details?  Yeah  The bodies were found in a car  At a cemetery  Yeah  Bullet wounds to the back of the head  One bullet each  That is some old school mafia shit  For the guy and his girl  Right  Oh wow, the chick too, huh?  Yeah  They bought a Cadillac apparently 
[00:05:00]  And they were flashing money around  And they probably shouldn't have  I love that car  I love that car  It was a gift  It was a gift  That's old school  Old school mafia though, man  Yeah, yeah, yeah  One bullet to the back of the head  Nice and clean and easy  I think he's Italian, right?  Both two Italians  Yeah, the names looked a bit Italian  Yeah, yeah  The guy was still belted in  Seat belted in  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So that's somebody that they probably knew  And trusted in the back seat  And just popped, popped them in the back of the head  Pop, pop  Hey Rocco, sit on that side of the car 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah  That's what a dick  Somebody who knows in the back seat  Yeah, yeah, sit on that side of the car  But  Yeah, they went  Never shut the fuck up  Went to a quiet place like the cemetery  To maybe talk some business  Yeah, yeah  Next thing you know  Oh no  Whacked out  He got whacked  It's great too  The description in here  The one bullet each  To the back of the head  And the second line is  Is a man  Actually  The balding man  Lenny Archipolo  What did you have to say it like that? 
[00:06:00]  Just leave him alone  He's dead  Could you give him a little dignity of death?  He might have had hair  And it was blown off his head  Yeah, maybe  Let the guy do the autopsy  Yeah, make believe he had a full head of hair  At least  I know  The balding man  That's wonderful  Any more insults?  Yeah  The comedian with erection difficulties was found  Yeah  Any more insults as you put him in a bag?  Yeah, right?  What the fuck?  He was a little fat  For his eternal sleep  Yeah, exactly  So, wow  Yeah, that went down  That's more interesting than the World Series 
[00:06:30]  Yeah  Yeah, a nice little old school New York mob hit  And your dumb Joe Girardi gets a three year deal  Nine million dollars for doing what?  What did he do?  What did he do?  He got him to the playoffs  Where he made some awful pitching decisions  Exactly  And that was it for the Yankees  But  Yeah  Yeah  I didn't think they were going to get rid of him  They got rid of the pitching coach  True  But  Yeah, he's got three more years, I guess  Why do we talk baseball like  I mean  All year long 
[00:07:00]  All year long  We're still talking about the Yankees  Because there's always deals being made  And then the World Series is over  And then they start spring training in two weeks  Yeah  Or so it seems  Well, because they're still playing the World Series  So everybody likes, you know  Kind of talking about it a little bit  I just like the fact that I could watch it  And people on Cablevision couldn't  Cablevision's been saying that  They're going to give people this refund  And then they're going to let them subscribe to MLB online  To watch the World Series  So they can watch it on their laptop at home 
[00:07:30]  Instead of, you know, a nice big screen television  What a bunch of fucks  In 5.1  Where it's like you're sitting at the game  I know  Sometimes you screw up  And you go to the regular  Standard definition channel  Yeah  And then it's like  Oh, fuck, I forgot  It's HD  And then you go to the HD channel  And you're like  Oh, it's Dorothy  Walking out of the fucking house  After the tornado  It's just an amazing thing  That's so true  Well, there's a class action suit  Yeah, class action suit 
[00:08:00]  Against Cablevision  So all the customers will get $1.75  When it's all over  Yeah  Those class action suits  Never work in your favor  It's just to fuck the company  More so than it is to get money  Right  You know  Because  Alright, yeah  You're only making $5  But it's 8 million people  So the company's like  Ow  It'd be hilarious  If they make the company  Just write out  Each individual check  A little check  8 million checks  For $5.27  Like Steve Martin  And the jerk  Right 
[00:08:30]  Or Jerry Seinfeld  For the happy  What was it?  The happy fun time show  Shit, man  I gotta watch more Seinfeld  I'm so out of the Seinfeld discussion  It's been off the air  10 years, right?  No, I can't get enough of it  Crazy  That and Hoarders  I love watching Hoarders  Good old Hoarders  I can't get enough of that  That's available now on Netflix, too  Yeah  I've been noticing this changeover  In the way I watch television  It's standing on my head 
[00:09:00]  It's upside down  It's amazing  It's a weird way to watch TV  No, it's not  It's  Apparently I suck dick  Alright, thank you, sir  That's a hell of a way to start the morning  Hell of a how do you do in the morning  The people we talk to  They're just wonderful people, aren't they?  I know  Jesus Christ  But I've been watching  Less cable television  And more alternate media  You know, like Netflix  And even cable 
[00:09:30]  I won't just go around the channels  Unless I'm watching something like Discovery  Or Science Channel  Or something like that  But as far as movies go  I rarely go to HBO  And watch a movie  That's scheduled on their time  And shit like that  I'll go to On Demand  I'll go to Netflix  To watch an HBO movie  Starting at 8 o'clock  What's that?  That's so old school  It's like, that's not my schedule  Why would you do that?  The only bad thing is  You never know what time it is  Based on the movie  The movie ends  And it's like, you know  8, 19 
[00:10:00]  Yeah  At least you got the pause feature  Finally  Yes  Kids, we grew up  Without a pause feature  No pause  It's terrible  It's an on-demand world  It's about time  Instead of watching  The World Series last night  I was catching up on Jersey Shore  Because we just booked  Oh boy  Well, we booked the situation  Oh, is he coming in?  He's coming in next week  So I'm like  Wow  Fuck, I better catch up  And watch the rest of these Jersey Shores  Can we get pictures with his abs?  I sure hope so  Ugh  Alright  It's fucking weak 
[00:10:30]  There's nothing going on  How many people on Halloween  Are going to have those awful  Put the string over your shoulder  So the plastic abs  Hang on your stomach  And it's like  I'm the situation  If you're dressing up as Snooki  This Halloween  Just don't do it  Uh-oh  Oh, who's doing it?  I don't know  Because everyone's doing Snooki  Are they?  That's going to be  The number one costume  That's what I heard  Alright  Did I just insult someone?  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I think Marissa is  I'm sorry 
[00:11:00]  She's a nice lady  Either that or she's been  You know  She's been painting herself orange  For no apparent reason  Oh, shit  I think she's tanning  I think she's tanning  I'm an asshole  I'm sorry  No, because it is  She's a nice girl  Oh, she's the first one  We'd call an asshole  She's a nice girl  But don't you think  The big costume's going to be Snooki  And all the Jersey Shore people  Yeah, I would think so  And a lot of dumb Lady Gaga bullshit  Lady Gaga  There's also going to be  I think a lot of

[00:22:30]  Yeah  And there's a lot of guilt  Heavy guilt thing  The middle child's never aborted  Like it was like  Hey were you supposed to  Timing wise though  Like maybe it was a drunken romp  One night after an argument  And the mother was kind of  Half asleep  And the father came in  And saw the gentleman of color  On top of her  What's the age difference  Between you and the one before you  My sister is three and a half years  Older than me  And my brother's two years younger  Nah that's not an abortion  You think I was a miracle baby  I don't know  I don't know what it is man 
[00:23:00]  Whatever  It starts with an M  Maybe you remind your mom  A lot  I was thinking something harsher  Oh really  I think you remind your mom  Of an old boyfriend  Or something  What that's weird  Exactly it's weird  And finally  From 1990  Oh that's the oldest one  Dick Tracy  I love Dick Tracy  She made the coat  Look at you  You wanted to be a child actor  So bad  Yeah I did  Because you're fucking  Let me see that  It's not good enough 
[00:23:30]  To just put on the Dick Tracy costume  You're like  You're playing the part  Oh my god  She made the coat  And painted the hat  What the fuck  Because it had to be yellow  I was detail oriented  Why didn't she buy a yellow hat  You have a little suit  You're wearing a little suit  Underneath your rain slicker thingy  That's what Dick Tracy wore  He certainly did  You put the dick in Dick Tracy  In this picture  Look at him  Look at him  Yeah I remember  You look so cute  Like this  He's adorable  Oh she couldn't get enough  Of her adorable  Sammy Ginn's  Oh right  I even had nice shoes on 
[00:24:00]  Like Dick Tracy  Think how fucked up she'd be  If you would have gotten killed  Like  Like Gage  Like little Gage  Yeah  Run over  I mean she already hoards  But imagine the hoarding  That would go on  After the loss  Oh the loss  For any parent  To lose a child  No you  It would have just been  One of those creepy  Like movie shit  Would have happened  Movie shit  You guys didn't have moms like that  Like Sam's mom  With Dawn and Joe  Would have taken over  The slack for me  Or you know 
[00:24:30]  My mom would blame us  For being born  That was what we got  In our family  That was terrific  You had a mom  That sewed you know  Costumes every year  For Halloween  And the Undertaker's urn  Is a cornmeal box  That's you know  Cylindrical  That we spray painted  With sparkly gold paint  There's like arts and crafts  Going on at your house  Your mom didn't do that for you  Oh my god no  Jimmy heard me  My mom did blame us  For being born at times  Really that was your decision  Not mine  My mom 
[00:25:00]  What your mom didn't do it Jimmy  No no no no no  I don't even  I think we had to just  Make up costumes  Last minute  Oh is that it  Yeah we'd throw some shit  On our face  And maybe  I'm a hobo  Yeah exactly  No a hobo  We didn't get this shit  My mom harbored  My creativity  Yeah great  Yeah your creativity  Were you always the one  That came up with the idea  You said I want to be this  Yes  Were you ever denied  Because it was too much work  I wanted a different lining  In the gold dust robe 
[00:25:30]  And she said no way  What lining to do on  Well he had gold lining  Not white lining  She should have had  Cum lining  She saved  She saved  She saved all these costumes  Right  They're in a closet somewhere  Oh yes  That's so fucking creepy  There's no reason to save those  She's a Samologist  That's what she does for a living  She works so hard on those  Sam museum to be opened  After he's president  Of the United States  She has this impression  That you're going to be president  There's going to be  A presidential library  And all this stuff 
[00:26:00]  Is going to be in it  I just remember  When I was on the wrestling team  She got really mad  At the coach  Because they had to order  A special singlet  Because I was so small  And  Your dick  Yes  No room in the crotch  No  But she wanted to  Buy the singlet  Like she insisted  She was like  Please let me buy the singlet  So I can keep it  And the coach said  No those small singlets  Are hard to find  We need to keep it  Ew  For the next  They key out  So what did she end up doing  She just got really pissed  They wouldn't sell it to her  And he was found  With a bullet  To the back of his head 
[00:26:30]  Yeah  In front of the cemetery  She waited enough years  She badly wanted my singlet  Dude my mom was the  Exact opposite  She was the opposite  Of a hoarder  Through everything way  Everything way  I have nothing  From my childhood  Nothing  I used to make  Stupid fucking radio tapes  In my room  When I was 12  That's fine  I would kill to have those now  So would we  We may poke fun at you  Oh I would have no problem  Bringing those in  And get a fucking beating  Brother man  Brother man  But she was the opposite 
[00:27:00]  Of Sam's mom  Yeah  She didn't keep nothing  If I  I mean  I mean nothing  All my wrestling  VHS tapes  Are still stacked up  In closets  Nothing is thrown away  What is that  Where are they  What is that Danny  That's Travis  Is that Travis  Yeah he's one of the  I think that's one of the  Seven dwarfs  Oh god  He's like a little kid  He's probably like seven  You guys had normal moms  That's kind of weird  Travis had a normal mom  Oh yeah  I forgot about Travis's mom 
[00:27:30]  You're right  That was the first time  She ever burped  Kugel into his face  He was like  What is that mom  Forget it  Well he did have  A normal mom though  Completely normal  Right up until she left  With the Jewish guy  She got a  She was completely normal  And that fucking  Hasidic cock  Changed the lives  Of everyone in the family  Yes  With the pay  Is hanging over his balls  Oh I hate that  I love Travis  I hate that woman  I know  Oh look poor Travis  Look at your  You were a Ghostbuster  Yeah of course  Now how'd you get the costume 
[00:28:00]  Bought at a store  What do you think  Oh your mom didn't make that  What a loser  No  Why didn't my mom make a costume  Fucking Sam  Sam  What an idiot  I'm a loser  Is that your brother  In the picture  Yes  So that's probably around  Undie flip age  Undie flip  Oh remember  Undie flips  Undie flips  Travis talked about  Undie flip age  But yeah I wouldn't be surprised  Travis you had  A happy childhood  Until what age  When did mommy leave  Undie flip  Yeah  My entire childhood  Was great  I had a great childhood  When did mommy leave though  When I was 21 
[00:28:30]  Oh wow  I don't need a mom  You're done with a mom  By then  Most animals  Leave their mother  Like a year  And you haven't seen  Your own mom  In how many years  Nine years  You tried reaching out  To her and she wouldn't  No  But you didn't  I stopped  Like nine years ago  But you did try once  Oh sure yeah  For like five months  After she left  But does she have  A problem with you  Personally  No  That is fucked  That's weird  Completely  She doesn't talk  To her brother  Disavows any knowledge  Why  I don't get it  Because of the religion thing  Yeah 
[00:29:00]  What  Yes  She's wearing a secret  Fucking yarmulke  Is she a hardcore Jew  Is she a hardcore Jew  Now maybe  I guess  You don't even know  Yeah from what I heard  It's a religious thing  Holy crap  Yeah it's like  You just pretend  That your life  Didn't exist  Wow  I hate her for that  No offense to you man  No disrespect  But I mean like  You know  For doing that to him  And it makes me sick  Yeah we're trying to make jokes  But that is just  It really annoys me  That's probably the worst  In the room right there  How could she have stayed  So long  Like there was so many  Opportunities to leave  When he was a teenager  It's been nine years though 
[00:29:30]  Holy shit  What was with the  Little dwarf costume  I was  I think sleepy  Were you sleepy  Or dopey  No I think I was dopey  No I'm dopey  I was going to say  E-rock costume  Could be either  Sleepy  Dopey  Fatty  You sleepy fool  Oh look  Zilchy  Maybe he could be  Tiety of something  You know  Oh chip  Who doesn't love  The seven dwarfs

There's no saved placenta  What's in the freezer again?  Baby teeth  They've kept your baby teeth  My mom said she doesn't know  Whose it is  Oh yeah  It could be mine or my brothers  Oh really?

Yeah  Cryogenically frozen  Well what if she can make  A new baby Sam out of that?  She's a problem  I was just thinking that  Between the hair and the baby teeth  They're gonna go into like  The pulp  And pull out some DNA  And make a little baby Sam  She's gonna get a mannequin  Or like a fucking  Like one of those heads  You put your hat on 
[00:48:30]  And stick the teeth in it  Like a crazy lady  And put that wig on it  And talk to it  After you're killed someday  And put the gold dust  Halloween costume back on  I miss you so much Sam  Sam look  I'm putting in the lining  I'm putting in the lining for you  Yeah  Oh god yeah  She's melting down  Oh that'd be great to watch  Right after his wake  Movie nuts  We're all laughing and applauding  And serious stock is going through the roof  No mother should ever have to  Bury their child  Oh please  Of course not  Let's go to David  There's a few exceptions

[00:49:30]  Plus look at all these  Look at all the pins on the hat  All those badges were for not telling your parents  You want a badge  Can you keep a secret  No tattletale badge  You don't get to be a bobcat for that  That yellow one is the  The walk  Even though his hiney was sore and bleeding  Walked normal in front of everyone badge  And the other badge was told the police officers  Nothing was wrong  Everybody was real impressed  By the amount of belt loops I had  On my Cub Scout belt  I think my mom  Because there's so many of them  What are those for  I don't know what that is anymore  They're for accomplishments 
[00:50:00]  Oh yeah  But I think my mom was fudging numbers  Because there's  Ten zipper opened at two in the morning  Like a good lad  There's five bowling belt loops on here  And four swimming belt  You're not supposed to have  The same belt loop over  She was cheating for you  You're not supposed to have  The same one over and over and over  What are you doing  She's like a stage mother  Oh really  You've earned another bowling belt loop  Yeah you were supposed to be  A child actor or something  Exactly  You were supposed to be in a sitcom  Anything  To take her out of that awful town  What are the other patches  Let me see  There's a recruiter 
[00:50:30]  Now what does that mean  You were  You recruited other little boys  Oh that's great  Yeah  For the scout leader  Tell all your little friends  To come by Sam  Tell them what happens  In this basement  Yeah  This I got at the  Aquila Camporee  For the Hutchinson River District  In 1994  Because I went to the camporee  The camporee  That's a jamboree right  Yeah but it's not  It's like for  For Cub Scouts  It's not a sleep away camp  Why  But you spend the day  Doing camp stuff  Oh just the day  How gay is that  It's supposed to be like camping  And then a flash flood 
[00:51:00]  Is supposed to come  And kill you all  Look at that  Westchester Putnam Council  That's a nice thing  What did that do  That just meant  That's where I'm from  Westchester Putnam  You get a patch  For where you're from  That stinks  And you're pack  I'm pack 40  What  Pack 40  Are you saying  A lot of people  You didn't go pack 40  What  I didn't at the time  But I am now  Because he's now  A little urban  Hey a lot of people  A lot of people  Are asking about the foreskin  Because we got some calls  Where the wife  Saved the foreskins  Of their children  No 
[00:51:30]  There was no saved foreskin  You were circumcised  At what  19  So did  Your mom  Had to clean your foreskin  For you  No she didn't clean  At what age  Did she stop cleaning  Your foreskin  Oh really  I have no recollection  At what age  Did she begin using water  As opposed to saliva  She'll be upset by that  She'll be upset  Bobby I'm sorry for that  I felt guilty  As it came out  You're implying  She took her tongue  I'm sorry  I'll just describe it  In grave detail  I really do mean that  In humor  I'm embarrassed  Of course you do  Oh don't worry 
[00:52:00]  I'm sorry I said that  When do we get to  Talk to Bobby again  I mean you could  Wake her up  If you wanted  No we have another mom  To talk about today  Oh yeah we do  This is the segue  It's a problem  Fucking Stevie's mom's here  Yes  Oh wow  Did she come  Who the fuck asked  For Stevie's mom  Because she's here  She showed up  She showed up  At 5 a.m.  With donuts  What happened  Really  Yes  Oh we all asked for her  Let's talk to her  Yeah we said  Stevie suggested it originally  And I said great idea  And then he came on the air  And you guys said  We'd love to talk to her  So I said yeah 
[00:52:30]  Around 7 o'clock or so  Just have her come in  Around 7  And then we'll get to her  When we get to her  So I got a phone call  At 5 o'clock this morning  On the office phone  With Stevie  Hey Sam I'm on my way  I said yeah okay fine  Whatever  And he said  Will my mom be able  To get in  And I said what  And he said  Is she in the system  And I said what do you mean  And he said  We're in the cab  She's with me  Of course  And at 5 o'clock  In the morning  Yeah  Okay Stevie 
[00:53:00]  It's cheaper that way  They could share  Is she normal though  She seems very nice  And normal  She seems like a great lady  But I don't know why  This poor lady  Came in at this hour  Of the morning  Alright we'll talk to her  After the break  Well we gave Stevie  A beating the other day  Because you had mentioned  Him coming in  And he didn't come in  So I think he wanted  To do the right thing  And prove he's dedicated  Well he gets another  He got another beating  This morning  I waited until his mom  Was out of the room  Does the mom look  A little funny  Like Stevie  No  So that means Stevie  Might be a little funny  I want to hear about 
[00:53:30]  The ex-husband  Who was the father  We'll cover all of it  And we gotta ask  If Stevie's a little funny  Yeah  We have to  Because we saw  Her daughters  Or at least one of them  Right  And there's nothing  Wrong with them  Nothing funny  Nothing funny with them  She's a little funny  She's gotta at least  Be disappointed in Stevie  Like  My mom was very proud  Of me  Yeah yeah  She's gotta be a real disappointment  What an asshole  Oh he's right though  God damn it  He's right  He has a sitcom family  Everything's perfect  Questions are coming in

[00:56:00]  It's spooky music  Yeah well you know  It's Halloween  This is our big Halloween show  It's amazing  Everyone's dressed in costumes  Yes Dan  And there's just as many people here  As the last party we had  Alright  How to fucking bring that up  Oh damn  Oh snap  That's two years ago already  Or is it three  Might have been three  I think it's three yeah  That means we haven't seen the public  In three years  We really need to do something else  No we don't  We just didn't promote that one right  No we don't  That was our fault  Had that been promoted right  That would have been better  You think  I know  I remember not promoting it 
[00:56:30]  I wonder if it would have been better  Without a doubt  A Halloween party  At the Hard Rock  Of course it would have been  Wasn't it like a weekend  And it was really nice weather  We didn't promote it right  It was a perfect storm of shit for us  Yeah and I think it was like  On Halloween  Oh yeah  So like  So you're competing with  All the other parties out there  Plus people with kids  They gotta bring their kids  Trick or treating  Oh we justified it amazingly  But we honestly  We didn't sell it right  Or we didn't make it look like  There was going to be  A bunch of stuff happening  We're like  The week over 
[00:57:00]  Will I come down  Yeah that was  Really well  If we had built that up  We would have gotten more people  We'll figure something out  Who's outside the studio  We got Katie  Katie Featherston  Katie Featherston  Is she in the new movie  Yeah she's in the new  Paranormal Activity 2  Yeah we talked to her  When Paranormal Activity 1 came out  Stupid E-Rock  Played the Paranormal Activity 1 interview  Yesterday after the show  But I remember that being a snooze fest  What?  It was pretty 
[00:57:30]  It was pretty  It was pretty dull  It was good  It was a good interview  Yeah it was very nice  But why would you play that yesterday?  That I don't know  That's stupid E-Rock  Yeah we're going to have to lay into  Katie Featherston has 15 minutes  Let's bring her right now  Good then let's talk for another 7  Before  Oh Jesus  What happened?  Oh my god  Katie Featherston  From Paranormal Activity 2  Let's bring her in  Entering the studio  A big star  Don't hug our guest Roland  Hi guys  Hello  I remember you  Hi how are you  Welcome back to the show 
[00:58:00]  Oh thanks  Ooh  Paranormal Activity 2  Yes  Taken off in movie theaters  Yeah it's pretty well  40 million left  Last week  Holy  Very well  I thought there was like  A bad economy  How come like jackass  Made a shitload of money  And now Paranormal Activity  Makes a whole bunch of money  Escapism  Is it  Escapism  They're so sad  They have no money themselves  That they're going out  To enjoy movies  How much money did it cost  To make number 2  Because number 1  Eight dollars  The rumor was  Number 1 was how many 
[00:58:30]  The first one was 15,000  15,000  They upped it a little  For the second one  With a solid cool 3 mil  Oh  Okay  So they didn't go crazy  No I think  In Hollywood terms  I guess that's still  Sort of like pennies  3 million  And then you gross  40 mil  I know  Of course somebody will say  We lost money  I don't know what happened  But if it worked  If it worked  Only using 15,000  They should have done  The same exact thing  Yeah well  Pump it up a little bit  You know the first one  Was just Oren and Mika  And myself 
[00:59:00]  It was just 3 people  We just you know  Filmed in a house  But it's different  When it's done by a studio  Because you have to pay  You have to have a crew  And you have to you know  This one's star studded  Betty White's in it I hear  Yeah she has a  She has a cameo  As a fellow vegan  Oh I'm kidding  She was great  I wouldn't be surprised  That's funny  Oh literal  She's in everything  But I would totally believe it  I know  Every time you look at the TV  There's Betty White  I die already  What's the difference  Between this one  And the first one  Well the second one  You know  Stays true to the first one 
[00:59:30]  In the sense that  It's still really  Very realistic  And improvisational  But it's  It's amped up a little bit  Not unrealistically  But you know  It's definitely  You know  Super scary  That fast moving stuff  Is very scary  That whole like  Getting dragged away  Like drag  The trailer shows it like  You know  And so it's just getting  Dragged out the doorway  And it's very scary  It's always  Because it's unexpected  There's a lot of dread  And suspense that builds up  And then you know  Gets you right when you  Yeah things that pop  On the camera like that  Where you're looking at  Like some kind of  Surveillance looking camera  And something pops on it  But I'll scare the shit out of me 
[01:00:00]  Do you pay attention  One of Danny's friends  Stealing stuff from my house  Oh I forget  Yes  Yes we  He had a party  And one of his friends  Stole from him  Stole some stuff  And from her  I had him on the  Surveillance camera  It was great  That's awesome  Yeah  But he got away  How does he get away  How does he get away  Thank you  But there was only one  NYPD officer  And one FBI agent  There wasn't enough coverage  I'm sure in the condition  They were in  They didn't want to be  Calling in backup  He had to come to this 
[01:00:30]  Fucking house  There might have been  A situation  So do you guys  Pay attention to opening  Money like the actors  Or do you really  Like you care right  Like do you notice it  Like  Well you know  It's sort of  You know how much money  It makes sort of  Relates to how many  People went to go see it  And so you want people  To be excited  Unless it's one  Real expensive ticket  One super expensive  You know  Push seat  It's like oh  We only have one person  See the movie  But yeah  I keep an eye on it  But I don't stress out  About it or anything  You know  For other people 
[01:01:00]  To worry about  Other people smarter  And more involved  With money than me  And how much of this  Movie are you in  This doesn't center  Around you guys  Right  It centers  It centers around  Another family  And without  I don't want to ruin it  For people who haven't  Seen it  But it does  Sort of tie into  The first one  In very interesting ways  So if you haven't  Seen the first one  Don't worry about it  You'll totally  Understand everything  But if you have  Seen the first one  Then you'll  I think  Enjoy how the two  Sort of mesh  And create  I would suggest  You watch the first one  And then you go  See the second one  I like that plan  Have like a little marathon 
[01:01:30]  Exactly  I love a good marathon  It's Halloween weekend  So it's a perfect time  To do it  Yes  Are you a big star now?  Am I a big star?  I don't feel like  I feel like it's me  I mean  Is she a big star?  Since the last time  You were in here  Well  I mean  I don't know  Sometimes I get recognized  And things like that  So that's  Kind of cool  Always really nice  And it's definitely  I mean  Life is a little bit  Life is a lot different  Than it was  You know  18 months ago  So  Yeah  Can pay some bills 
[01:02:00]  I can  Pay a few bills  I can pay bills  And not  That's nice isn't it  Stress  So that is  A huge huge blessing  But I just  I still feel like me  It's hard for me  To judge that kind of stuff  So you should be  Just being really mean  To fans for no reason  You know  I have  I have seen that happen  And it is shocking  By what  By  You've been out  With celebrities  And you've seen them  Be being in people  I've just seen  Other celebrities  Be very ungracious  Towards people  How are they ungracious  Like what was said  It was just sort of 
[01:02:30]  Sort of like  You know  I don't have time  For you kind of stuff  And maybe at some point  I don't know  Even if you don't have time  I feel like you should  Either make some time  Or be really nice  And you know  Yeah  Did they actually say  I don't have time  Or were they  Dismissive in attitude  It was  It was very dismissive  And it was  I gotta get out of here  Kind of stuff  You know  You've been in that situation  Jimmy  The big unit  Did that to you  He sure did  Yeah  I've been blown off  By very big  Because Jimmy  Is an obsessive man  That loves taking photographs  With celebrities  So if he sees one 
[01:03:00]  Walking down the street  He will approach them  And try to get a photo  Unless they're with  The kids or something  Then I just  I scream at the children  Until they leave  Can you just like  Run by with the camera  And like awkwardly take it  And you're all right  I say  Can I hold your kids  For a picture  I'm like  You got some cute kids  Can I pick them up  Or something  Yeah but no  Randy Johnson  Was kind of a dick  But he's a dick  To a lot of people  Yeah yeah  He's known  You can tell  He's just a dick  In general  So you're happy  To take photos  With people  Oh  I  You know what  I'm so thankful  And grateful  That people  Enjoy the movies  And are excited 
[01:03:30]  About them  And about me  That yeah  I mean  That means  That means you're not  Really famous  Then  There you go  See that's the  You'll get to the point  Where you blow it off people  No  I'm joking  I'm always joking  The celebrity that you saw  Blow off people  Were you working with them  No  Were you at a party  Or were you out in a  I was just out and about  I was out and about  In the same vicinity  Oh okay  And I saw it happen  And I was disappointed  How famous are they  Moderately  Was it Jay Moore  It was not Jay Moore 
[01:04:00]  Can we try to guess  Louis C.K.  Would you give up the name  No I would never  Why  You're not trashing them  You'll never have to work with them  No I would never do it  I would never do it  See she's good  She knows how to keep  All those bridges up  She's not a bridge burner  Like us  Like Patrice O'Neill  Like us  I feel like y'all are just  Like burning bridges  Y'all are just  Tossing the flames  Flame on  Yeah  Yes we love burning  Of a good bridge  Oh yeah  Do you think you'll ever  Work with that person  Um  Maybe  Probably not though  I can't really see it happening  You don't want to say 
[01:04:30]  What it is  That's fine  Are they male or female  Al Pacino  Transgendered  It was a girl  Oh okay  Oh Gwyneth Paltrow  No  Lindsay Lohan  I'm just  Lindsay Lohan  Right  I hate  His wife's niece  Went for a photo  With Lindsay Lohan  And she was just  Shit about it  And I've hated  Lindsay Lohan  Ever since then  I love that  You remember that story  I hate her for it  No one was around  It was a park band  And it was a kid  She was hanging out  In between takes  Doing some horse shit movie  That never did anything  About Lennon  And yeah 
[01:05:00]  They walked by  Asked for a picture  The little girl  And niece  She couldn't have been  More than 12 at the time  Yeah people are reasonable  And nice when they're coked up  Yeah  Yeah I know  So you should have  Expected courtesy  And then she got  Her big  Big huge bodyguard  Involved to  Kind of push him away  It's just like  Really cool  I think everybody  Just needs to be sweet  Really  Aw look at you  I'm always nice to people  When they ask for photos  Which they really don't  So I'm like  Would you like a photo with me  You're asking people  Do you want to take a photo with me  Yeah would you like to  If I see tourists  Asians  Or Europeans 
[01:05:30]  With like sandals  And high black socks  Like would you like me  In this picture  I'm clipped  You know  My mom and I  We're in a restaurant  And we have this kind of joke  That she will like  Awkwardly like  When they're like  You know  Blonde girls  All wearing the same outfit  All you know  Taking pictures and stuff  My mom will just awkwardly  Like sort of like  Lean in to the photo  So that they won't notice  Until later  That there's this weird  You know  It's a lady  Yeah just sort of  Awkwardly in the back  Which I find to be  We kind of have a thing here  Where everybody tries  To ruin each other's pictures  With celebrities  Yeah all the time  I think that's awesome  I think that's really fun 
[01:06:00]  Yeah I love that  Someone in the background  Just making a dumb face  It's satisfying  Or you're not just  Standing there  With a regular face  Do you know how annoyed I am  When I get pictures developed  Or no  When I look at them  Developed  I know exactly  In the photo match  Yeah I do that a lot  I have like a little  Point and shoot  And how annoyed I am  Which I have a picture  With Quentin Tarantino  From we had him on  In K-Rock  And Anthony's brother Joe  Isn't making a face  But that dummy  Is just standing there  Like a lump  It's like what are you 
[01:06:30]  Doing in there  Gotta photoshop him  Out of there  Yeah  Yeah I should have  But then I  Whatever it's always annoying  Who's the best photo  You had to meet somebody  Who you love  Since you've been famous  Yourself now  Joel McHale  Oh yeah  I had such a little  Celebrity crush on him  And then  Last year I did his  The soup  And he was so  Kind and generous  And just totally normal  And so nice  And I was just like  Oh wow  You are awesome  In real life too  Yeah he's been on our show  He's such a dick  Yeah he's really 
[01:07:00]  We hate his guts  No  I'm kidding  He's really funny  He is good  Yeah he was really nice  Did you still have a crush  On him when you saw him  In person  Well it was a  You know  Famous person crush  So they're not real  It's just sort of like  I see you on TV  So she's saying in person  She found him repulsive  Well  Repulsive  And also charming  But you know  She can hang  He's just a beautiful guy  Would you have  You know  You know  Would you  You know  If the situation was such  Are you single  No  I have a boyfriend  Okay  Is he new 
[01:07:30]  Or is he from  Before the first one  He's from before  Oh that sucks  He's in trouble  When you got the same guy  He's in trouble  Oh that's the worst  No you never want  To get famous  You never want  To get famous  You want to meet  Somebody who wants  You're famous  So then you know  Like okay  This is someone  I really want  As opposed to  Someone who you  Had before  Who you probably  Liked at the time  But now  Are you trying  To ruin her relationship  Yes  But here's the other  Way to look at it  If you  Hook up with somebody  After you're famous  Then maybe they only  Want to hang out  With you  Because you're sort of  Famous  As they should  Exactly 
[01:08:00]  But before  He liked me  For me  And my whole  Unfamousness  No no  I understand that  But I was doing  I was doing great  When I was knocking  Tin up in  Freaking ceilings  Putting in air  Conditioning units  Just doing stellar  I have to use  Whatever I can get  And I don't expect  A woman to look  At this complete package  And like it  For what it is  How long  You call creeps  Well it's different  For women I think  Too like  She's probably  Not happy  She's a nice guy  What's he do  What kind of work  In general  He's like a 
[01:08:30]  Web designer  Marketing guy  Is it hard  Are you snoring  About his awesome  I was really  Kind of like  That whole thing  I'm in IT  And he's a musician  So there you go  He keeps a little  Bit of a dream  In there  Did your success  Kind of make him  Jealous  It's hard I think  For a guy to watch  A woman become  More famous  And make more money  No  He doesn't care  No he's super  Confident  Like guys taking  Pictures with you  He's like  He's alright with that  He's awesome  Oh really  He's like  Take a picture with her  He's always the one  Holding the camera 
[01:09:00]  Oh how powerful is that  Yeah let me take  Another one  He's a  He's a trooper  He doesn't  He's super cool  Oh alright  My girlfriend doesn't like that  Like if we're out  And somebody like  Wants to take a photo  With me  I won't ask her  To hold the  She gets annoyed  I just know she would  She's just a crank  Yeah yeah yeah  Why would she get annoyed  You can't do that  By the way I found out  A great way to annoy  My girlfriend last night  This is what you do  That noise  Went through her  Like a knife  What do you do to her 
[01:09:30]  I just did that  In the car as a joke  Like it was Halloween  You know Halloween  Oh  That one  Yeah  I need to work on it  No no just the noise  I'm just trying  To make it scarier  It wasn't scary at all  Alright  She hated it  Maybe the fact  I was doing it in her face  And I was just eating tuna fish  That's probably more  Than the sound  So what other TV are you doing  I mean you gotta be  Doing some TV right  Yeah what do you got  They got you torn  All over the place  Yeah just ruined some  Press stuff on  Me on Today show  Today  Oh are you  Wow look at that  So that'll be fun 
[01:10:00]  And I think doing  Something with MTV  That's cool  Is that live  I think yeah  Live  Yeah  With Kathy Lee and Hoda  So I'll be hanging out  Talking about things  So like your life  Has changed a lot  In the last year and a half  Have you done any other movies  Or have you only done  This second  This sequel  I've only done the sequel  I've got a  A really awesome project  That I'm trying to  Kind of get off the ground  That's happening  You know  With a good pace  Why don't they throw you  On a CSI or something  I guess they  Everyone does that  Just yeah  Everyone does those  Crime shows  Yeah yeah yeah

I'm just kidding  Oh my god  He's a good boy  I mean yeah  He's a very original boy  I see him as a very original  He's not the run-of-the-mill guy  That we usually have come through here  I don't want to use the word special 
[01:24:00]  Sometimes that implies special  Like in need of a class that's special  Or something like that  How did Steve do in school?  Great  In like all the little grades  And then high school and everything  He did fine  He was good  Is he a thoughtful, sensitive boy  Or does he have anger issues?

[01:24:30]  She don't want to bring up the old man  Oh she doesn't either  I don't blame you guys  It's probably some kind of court order  He's told us enough  Where we're like  Alright we get it  Yeah we kind of leave it alone  So now Stevie was good in school  What we've talked  Because we watch him at the computer and stuff  Technically what is with his peepers?  He has nystagmus  It's a stag  What is that? 
[01:25:00]  Nystagmus  Nystagmus?  It's brain waves from the brain to the eyes  That make them shake  It's not a muscular  Oh really?  Yeah  God that sucks  That's shaky eyes  There is no god  Yeah have some water  You're a little nervous  So your eyes kind of go back and forth?

[01:25:30]  What does he want to do?  What does he want to be?  Has he ever talked about his aspirations?  Absolutely  Yeah  He wants to be on radio  On the radio  Yeah  Have you ever heard him on the radio on this show?  A little bit  What do you think personally?  What do you think personally how he does?  How he  Well I know he was a little nervous the first time he was on  Yeah  That's the only time I heard  I haven't heard  Is that it?  Yeah  He's done good stuff for us  He hasn't gotten better  I'm teasing of course  It's hard to be an intern here 
[01:26:00]  They get ridden a lot  But it's part of the gig  He kind of knew  It really is  It's like a hazing that goes on  It's like a rite of passage into radio  Or to a trade  You know  He's however it works  We're not allowed to make him do push-ups anymore  So that's good  She doesn't know about that  That's great  He doesn't tell me anything  Oh no?

[02:34:30]  What are we shooting now?  Oh my god  Zombie bear  I'm going to have this  I'm going to have this game  Playing on my screen  For my big Halloween party  Are you doing anything  Saturday, Lance?  I'm going to be out of town  Where?  I'm going to be up in Massachusetts  Where, I might say  I took Danny  Who I felt sorry for  Because he didn't get promoted  And a bunch of other stuff  And he was having a terrible week  He'd ruined your carpet  Because he's terrible 
[02:35:00]  At having a girlfriend  And Keith had to throw him out  And take his keys  So I said  You know what  Let me take you camping  I'm getting some friends together  We're going to go  We're going to go  Into the woods  Up in Massachusetts  Where I've got a cabin up there  And it'll be easy  We'll be like 100 feet  From the cabin  So if the weather's shitty  Or whatever  Right  And he asked Keith  This is how much  This group of people  Hate each other  He asked Keith for a tent  Keith literally got a tent  From his parents 
[02:35:30]  From the Korean War  The instructions were typed out  I mean you imagine  Somebody going  Hey girl  Type this up  So the boys in the field  Know how to put it together  It was this  Dude it was  Dude it was so fucking thick  It was  Dude there were poles  On the inside  That held it up  Like a mash tent  Dude it was a proper  4077 fucking tent  Meanwhile you got those  Modern lightweight  Fits in your pocket tents  Exactly  Yeah yeah  How long did you camp for?  Just a couple of days 
[02:36:00]  He was there 30 minutes  And my friend  Who was in his 50's  Pulled me aside  And goes  Your friend's really out of shape  Oh shit  Danny is getting fucking  These fucking cocks  Do this shit all the fucking time  I've never been camping before  Like real camping  Like where you do shit  We were walking  Through the forest  He's like  And then he's text messaging  This is really  I'm really tired  I'm like what are you doing  We're out in nature  He's like I can't get a signal  And then later  You know we sort of relax 
[02:36:30]  In front of the campfire  And have some drinks  And shoot the shit  He's like okay  I wanted to throw  His fucking iPhone  Fire  Yeah his fucking Berlin  Wasn't checking his phone  Every two seconds  No dude you are unbelievable  And here's what happens  Who was he trying to get  On the phone  He's like I gotta give  T-boy shit  And I'm like  You're here with me  See and this is the thing  When you go over to Anthony's  And his young apprentice Danny  Who's always over there  You're not spending time  With Danny or Anthony  You're spending time  With their iPhone  That's true  We will just sit there  And text and text and text 
[02:37:00]  And then the only conversation  We really have is  You wanna know the beer  Yeah  Yeah okay  Yeah  Glad I came over  So I could watch you text  Text bitches  And they're texting each other  That's hysterical  That was the tent  That I got to borrow  That is an old school tent  You could fit like five people in there  It's massive  That doesn't look fun at all  Wow  Meanwhile he's busting my balls  His friend had the same  Exact fucking one  But he brought it as a joke  He goes I got this tent  I've had  He goes I've had this tent  Since the 70's  I wanna see if it'll still work 
[02:37:30]  And uh  And by the way  It's not like we just went  Like on this nice little trail  Or anything  It was like  It was like  Climbing a mountain  We went eight miles  It was not like  Climbing a mountain  It was  On Friday  There was some steeps  It was like climbing a ladder  On Friday  On Friday we went for a hike  For literally one hour  And it was  It was very flat terrain  Uh huh  30 minutes  Into it  Dude he's huffing  And part of the sweat  Pouring down his face  We're in jeans  We're in jeans  It was unseasonably warm 
[02:38:00]  Last month  Oh shit  Oh Danny  And then the next day  We went on the  We went on the Appalachian Trail  And I literally thought  That we were gonna have to carry him  He was a fucking mess  Well look  When someone invites you  To go camping  I thought  To me camping  You just sit by the fire  You drink beer  Oh that's the other thing  The beer  I told him  I said everybody brings  You know  An assortment of cool beers  And stuff  We sort of  You know  Share beers  And all that  He shows up  With Bud Light  Nobody drank  Any of his shitty beer  Good  More from me  Oh but you were happy  To try it  Oh that's a nice exotic beer 
[02:38:30]  From Boston  I'll try that one  And then on Sunday  Bud Light cleanses the palate  On Sunday  Everybody leaves  Right  Because normally  You go camping  Like you wake up pretty early  Everybody leaves  And it's just his  Lone tent  In the woods  And I'm sitting there  Like at 11 o'clock  In the morning  Noon  Going  Anytime Danny  He likes to sleep in  Wake up and go  Camping  You just left a tent out there  Oh that's great  How far were you from here 
[02:39:00]  Three hours  Except in  Western Mass  And how far of a hike  Into the woods was it  What  For  Once you park your car  How long do you have to walk  See  That's the  The cars are on the other side  Of that house  And  They got their tents  In the backyard  Right  It's basically tents  In the backyard  We were 12  And we wanted to sleep outside  Why don't you sleep in the cabin  Because it's fun  Sleeping on the ground  Where it's really uncomfortable  Yeah I would have hated  To play Xbox  And have heat  That would suck 
[02:39:30]  I thought it was  Unseasonably warm  And I was like  Are you going to be  And we're on the  Appalachian Trail  And he's  We're about three hours in  And he's in bad shape  And I'm like  Dude what's going on  He's like  I just go home  And rip bong  Hits and eat Burger King  It's really hard  Doing morning radio  I'm like  Do nothing  Do nothing  With your body  For like two years  And then  And then do an  Eight mile hike  On the Appalachian Trail  Do it  It was not  Oh my god 
[02:40:00]  Yeah it was eight miles  It was eight miles  It was tough  It was  Funny shit  I'm looking at his  Dude his friend  Like he said  You know  Was  How old  He was  Late 50s  He's not exactly  Like the pinnacle  Of like the in-shaped guy  He doesn't look like  The Atlas statue  And that guy  He was just fucking  Trucking along  And I'm looking  I'm like  How the fuck  Is he doing this  That's because  On the weekends  We actually do things  We don't just lay around  With our rich friend  And drink all their beer  This weekend  D-Boy's coming over  Yes  D-Boy  Will he be there  Saturday  D-Boy's coming 
[02:40:30]  That's why he's  Staying at my place  So it's easier for me  What's he going to  Dress up on  I don't want to ruin it  Oh he's got a  Sober person  He's got something  In mind  Well very good  Jocktober  We have to hear this  Dude  It is  I don't even know  What it is yet  Don't tell it  Because they haven't  Told me who it's  Going to be  It is  It's the final day  Of Jocktober  Is it bad stuff  Dude  It is  Horrendous  Oh no  Alright play  The Jocktober  Sweeper  Oh no  This is awesome

[02:47:30]  But I don't know why  We cared about the bus terminal  I don't know  This is appointment radio though  I'll tell you that much  And it's Opie and Anthony  Broadcasting live  In downtown Boston  At the Peter Pan bus terminal  This building's not gonna be here for long  And I think all these people are here  Because they want to win  The Halloween tickets  Right?

[02:49:00]  Exactly, I agree  It was topical  Very topical  Yeah  Can we bring Stevie's mom  Back in here  For a deep dickin  From Troy  You said hot dogs  Entertainment  We all heard  And then you had to go back  To the hot dogs  Let's go back to highlighting  The hot dogs we have  And a bus station  Yeah  Only three tracks to go  Fuck  Oh no  We made it through the first one  The second one is very short  It's just  And the second one  Laszlo is the one  I played for you  Oof  Oh no  Oh no  It's a fun one  I can't look at anybody  How could it be bad  It's only six seconds  I know  It's actually not bad  I could survive six seconds 
[02:49:30]  That's easy  Opie  How is this bad  It's not bad  You heard this Laszlo  It's not  It was the Opie era  Where he was making  Cool words  He hoped  To catch on  What are you talking about  No  It really  Is this another catchphrase  That I was hoping  The world  Another hook in the water  I mean  You were thinking  They're going to make a t-shirt  Out of this one day  It's only six seconds  How bad could it be  You weren't always the guy  Who left early  Sometimes you hung out  On your buddy  Ozone or Rocco's show 
[02:50:00]  And Anthony comes in the room  And Opie  How are you going to greet  Your buddy Ant  Interesting  There's only one way  To find out  You got to hit that button  Hey Ope  Anthony  Where's Anthony  Anthony just walked in  That mudahuck  Yeah  Look at Jimmy's face  Look at Jimmy's face  Oh  This is the worst 
[02:50:30]  October ever  Remember when you guys  Were destroying my  It's one show  This is how I felt  Jimmy is in shock  Jimmy looks like  He's on a stroke  Yeah  I got the feeling  You get when you're  Touched with electricity  I don't think  I don't think  Everybody might  I think people  Missed that  I think you might  Be right  We may have been  Because there's only  Six seconds  Like you said  We should probably  Revisit  That's a rough six seconds  That felt like  It fucking felt like  The six seconds in Dallas  Weren't as painful as that  And I was counting them down 
[02:51:00]  Going I can handle this  Until the last half a second  That's my favorite one  People are like  Oh boy  Anthony walked in a room  Exactly  That would only be shocking  If it was an AA meeting room  I'm going to fucking make  Mother Hucka t-shirts now  Let's hear it again  Let's hear it again  Heyo  Anthony  Where's Anthony  Anthony just walked in  That Mother Hucka  I'm a Mother Hucka  Mother Hucka

[03:11:00]  Sitting around  Shut up  The crows are on  Crows are on the radio  The douches are on the air  In one minute and a half clip  There were six mods  And two dudes  Can we hear that last moment again though  Yeah you want to hear that  That last moment again was wonderful  I feel like Greg Brady  Something tells me that  That shut up the crows are on  By the fact that D-Boy was cracking up over there  Is going to end up in the next  Opie and Anthony intro  There it is  That was  It's a little creepy

[03:14:30]  What's really embarrassing  Is I was  From what we just heard  Yes  I was in the airport  A couple of years ago  And I picked up a book  And I was like  Oh it's about vampires  That sounds awesome  And I'm halfway through it  And I realize  This is a book for girls  Nobody had cursed or fucked  It was just a lot of  Sexual tension  It was horrendous  I was like  Fuck the vampire already  Let's get this over with  Yeah please  I'll bite you on a clit  And we'll move on  What?  Uh oh  Oh no 
[03:15:00]  Fucking  Did somebody with the  Walona from Good Times Wigs  Bring in the wrong clip  No  What the fuck is this  I think we might have  Played it last year  I feel like we played it  At K-Rock or something  What is it?  I'm sure it's good  It's from the AAF days  Of course  And it's uh  Oh no  Cause Jim  I brought it in for you  Thanks  Cause I know that like  No no no no  Let's go home early  When you spin the dial  No no no  When you're looking for a radio show  Yes  Oh no no no  Let's go home early  The one thing  Like you like comedy  You're a comedian  I love comedy 
[03:15:30]  No  You like prank calls  No no no  I do  I always want to have a laugh  With a phony phone call  No no no  Exactly  Like we were gonna play  The Scott and Todd phone scam  But instead  Why not listen to an  Opie and Anthony  WAAF specialty  I agree  I'm  Oh  We did do a lot of prank calls  I love a good prank call  No no no  Oh my god  No no  I think  You might remember it  Once we start playing it  But that's no reason  Not to play it  It's long though  Mail order  I'm looking to place an order 
[03:16:00]  Oh no no no  You don't think so  Phone scams are great  Why it's a good phone scam  I love a phone scam  I would like to place an order  For some talent please  You can shoot some over  Oh my god  Man  Okay what are you ordering  I was thinking of  Starting with the schoolgirl outfits  Okay what catalog do you have  The adult baby catalog  What page number  36 looks pretty good  The sweet girl dress  Well what can you tell me  About this dress  It looks like it's black and white  Looks like a little girl dress 
[03:16:30]  Has kind of like a bib on it  Well that's good  Because he's always drooling  No no no  Why each I write it with the voice  I took the radio voice on  No no no  Well that's good  Because this sucks  I'm like a bib on it  Well that's good  Because he's always drooling  And spitting up on himself  It's below the knee  With a full skirt  For lots of petticoats  Is there enough room in there  For the you know  You know what  Come on be straight with her already  The male organ  For a baby day  He's hung like a  Alright 
[03:17:00]  Alright  Because usually when you make calls like this  You should have two people on the phone  Sure  Yeah yeah that's natural  With completely different roles  That are not determined what they are  What kind of homoerotic friendship  Is on this  Nobody knows  Just two people on the phone  Talking to another person  Ah turd  Ah turd  Can I tear down  You want me to tear down the wall in or not  Oh I know the wall  I'm looking to tear out the floors  We're going to plummet our deaths  Tear out the splices  Yeah exactly  Tear out the splices  Oh you hear it too  It's so blatantly obvious 
[03:17:30]  I'm talking to a big time production guy  What an idiot  I can't hear him  Blatantly obvious  Anthony's part was done in post  I just made a dumb call  At a completely different volume  No  Different volume  And different compression  Why wouldn't someone just hang up  Can we wait  Can we  Is it possible to go back  Like less than 30 seconds  No no for Laszlo's  Oof  Oof  That was such  An oof  It was such a great  Sigh of disgust 
[03:18:00]  Alright well  That's terrible  I knew this was coming in  My girl  Start with an OMG  I've changed the locks  Might as well  I'm turning it off  To protect our son  Uh oh  And finally  We're leaving  Mad  Can I hear that  I didn't catch the splice  The last quarter of the splices  I didn't catch  I thought you were bad for that stuff  No we  We had to  We had to pump it up a bit  So we did it in post  Yeah  Thank god you did  Here's what  Exactly 
[03:18:30]  Here's what would happen  During the songs  We would take phone calls  And tape them  And we'd have to have something  For the next break  Sometimes the calls were very good  And we'd put them on  And whatever the fuck happened  Happened  Sometimes  They weren't quite as good  As they could have been  So  You  You kind of embellish  On your side of the call  Rocco was a  A champ at doing that  To every call  And he was so bad  With you know  Hey yeah 
[03:19:00]  Fuck you Wang  Yeah  Yeah  Well you  You got any Chinese food  Yeah I do  And you could just tell  The splices and cuts  As you can in this  Well there's a good guy here  He did copy paste  To answer his questions  Yes  And it's so obvious  Because she doesn't even address  Or anything  No I know  That's just it too  Wouldn't you just hang up  If somebody was being  That belligerent  And  After  After you made  One of those statements  You might want to put  A few seconds  Of comedic silence  Rather than  Well let's just splice 
[03:19:30]  That back together  Like it never happened  No you don't have to  It's radio  You gotta keep it snappy  So just to simplify it  I'm doing the call  Initially  And what you hear  From Ant  Was done way after the call  Yeah yeah  Makes it way more fun  To listen to  Because we knew right away  Like oh fuck  Oh no I didn't catch that  This call stinks  And we're banking on it  For our next break  Yeah  Our next big break  This will get us to New York  I'm telling you  Yeah this will do it  Mad  Yeah  For the  You know  You know what  Come on be straight  With her already  The male organ 
[03:20:00]  For a baby  He's hung like a horse  The male organ  It's a dress  Well I never put on  A dress before  I once put on  My grandmother's panties  Though  The big bloomers  And boy do they smell  Of course it's gonna be  I mean you're gonna have  More room for your penis  In a dress  Than you are in pants  You know  Yeah I never thought  Of it that way  What about the rubber panties  Rubber panties  What about them  Yeah he wants to  Put them on his head  While I get  Jesus  Oh god  Oh god  Shut up
