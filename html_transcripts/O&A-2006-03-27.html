<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  It began with planning for a "homeless shopping spree" planned for the Thursday before Christmas, where homeless individuals would each receive $202.  The hosts also discussed the absence of Graywolf and speculated on the whereabouts and employment of Paul Mercurio.  A homeless woman, Donna, was then brought into the studio.  The ensuing conversation detailed Donna's life on the streets, her drug use (heroin and cocaine), and her work as a sex worker, including graphic descriptions of her experiences and pricing.  A studio guest, Bill, then proceeded to sniff Donna's genitals and anus.  The hosts and Bill reacted to the smell with varying degrees of disgust and amusement. The segment concluded with a satirical bit featuring a stereotypical, inane female contributor.


The show then transitioned to a discussion about a study suggesting gay men disproportionately drive hybrid vehicles, prompting crude jokes and speculation. This led to an interview with Harry Reams, a former adult film actor known for *Deep Throat*. Reams recounted his career, legal battles (involving the Colombo crime family), struggles with homelessness and alcoholism, and his subsequent recovery and success as a real estate broker.  Audio clips from *Deep Throat* were played, and the conversation remained heavily laden with offensive language and sexually explicit content. While Reams was being interviewed, women distributing "Wow" stickers for a show promotion entered the studio.  The hosts also briefly mentioned other XM radio programming, including NHL games and ads for shows like Ron and Fez.


Further discussion with Reams ensued, focusing on his career, the number of women he’d slept with, and film titles (clarifying that older footage was reused under different titles). The conversation maintained its sexually suggestive and crude tone.  The discussion then abruptly shifted to a recent increase in home invasions in Nassau County, Long Island.  Anthony Cumia announced his plan to buy a shotgun for self-defense. The hosts and callers engaged in a discussion about the rise in home invasions, the gangs allegedly responsible (Latin Kings, M18, MS-13), and appropriate self-defense measures, using offensive language, racist and ethnic slurs, and graphic descriptions of violence. Callers offered their perspectives, some advocating for increased gun ownership.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of home invasions, promotion of upcoming XM programming, and jokes about Anthony’s shotgun purchase; they also discussed the slang term "shwoogie".


The show continued with a hypothetical scenario about increasingly brazen home robberies and a debate on the legality of using deadly force in self-defense during a home invasion. This transitioned into a lengthy segment about XM's extensive security procedures for guests.  A caller, Joey, described a 40-minute security process, prompting outrage from the hosts who confronted Master Poe, the security personnel involved.  Master Poe explained the new, stricter procedures due to paperwork and computer issues, but the hosts protested the invasive nature of the process, particularly the requirement for a social security number and multiple photos.  The segment concluded with a heated discussion about the security measures and the potential for identity theft. The discussion then shifted to a news story about the resurgence of knitting, which the hosts mocked extensively with listener calls. Finally, Jim Norton called in from Los Angeles, recounting a disastrous trip involving a roach-infested apartment, a disappointing encounter with a large prostitute, flight issues, and rental car problems.


A significant portion of the show recapped the previous day's broadcast, which featured significantly more sexual activity than usual due to the absence of Jimmy.  Three out of five female guests were completely nude and engaged in a "wiffle ball bat challenge" involving lubrication, followed by a lesbian encounter involving "box eating." Bob Kelly was also present and participated. The hosts then discussed Opie's encounter with an overweight woman he met online, contrasting her online photos with her actual appearance.  They joked about Jimmy's absence in Hollywood and the near-relapse of Harry Reams (who appeared the previous day) after interacting with the female guests; one guest was referred to as "Cock Hog."  Opie then recounted a rambling, sexually explicit story about a large woman he encountered in Houston, interspersed with the repeated singing of "Ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone," followed by a song parody about Christopher Reeve's paralysis. Audio of Hilary Swank discussing CPR training and a failed rescue attempt was played. The show concluded with Bob Kelly joining the studio, an apologetic explanation from Opie about Bob's arrival, promotional announcements for other XM programming, and an explicit phone call. Bob Kelly was in studio for part of this broadcast.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And he's going to be bringing in a homeless person once a week and then we try them out  and see if they're good enough for the homeless shopping spree.  That will happen in, when are we going to do this, mid-December?  Yeah, I think it's the last Thursday before Christmas.  The last Thursday before Christmas.  Yeah, I guess the malls would be pretty packed at the malls would be pretty packed at that point.  That's a good idea.  That's a good one.  What?  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[00:05:30]  What?  That's a good speculation right there.  What?  It's a name that's on there.  Arch enemy.  Yeah.  He's completely hated and despised by both of us.  Yeah.  Pretty much dropped off the face of the earth.  Yeah.  And probably is available for employment.  Yeah.  Paul Mercurio.  And if...  You want to write it down?  And it's absolutely not him.  All right.  Write it down.  Yeah, but, uh...  Fuck no. 
[00:06:00]  But what a great bit of speculation that is, because it fits the whole criteria.  I guess.  No.  He's too busy hobnobbing with all the big celebrities, though.  Is that what's going on?  I haven't even heard his name being dropped in any circles.  That's what his life's all about.  So the homeless shopping spree will happen the last Thursday before Christmas.  Okay.  And we're trying out the homeless people leading up to the big event.  We'll announce them all, hopefully, in the near future, so people could prepare and hang 
[00:06:30]  out with us that day.  And I think that day we're going to broadcast in the afternoon, do the whole thing.  Right?  Right.  I have no idea what you were talking about.  The homeless shopping spree.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  And the homeless people will get about $202 each, and it's going to be just a great day  for everybody.  By the way, getting lots of email.  People want to know where Graywolf is.  Haven't seen him.  Wow.  Really?  Been looking around for him.  We want to make him a big rock star, though.  That guy is right on the bubble.  He can be a big star with his music.  Yeah.  I look for him every day.  Don't.  Him. 
[00:07:00]  Haven't seen him.  Get him and Drew Boogie together in a studio.  Gold.  Huh?  I see Graywolf around the area of Madison Square Garden selling flutes all the time.  Selling flutes?  He sells flutes with a couple other Indian guys in the 30s on about 7th Avenue.  Well, let's get him in here.  Yeah.  Everyone's talking about that damn Shelter Me song that he sang about Tippi Tom.  I'm working on it.  I'll check it to him next time.  All right.  We've got to get Graywolf back in here.  All right.  Let's get this homeless woman in.  Keith, you're going to want to move over, too.  Nice.  A little buffer. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  So, if you weren't listening earlier, we've got a very good idea for Bill.  Good old crazy Bill.  Not Bill Burr.  Crazy Bill.  And this homeless woman.  Here she is.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong?  I'm nervous.  What's your name?  Donna.  Donna.  Donna.  Donna.  Hey, Donna.  Hi.  How are you?  All right.  I'm a horse right now.  You're what?  I'm a horse.  You're a horse?  Yeah, my foot.  Why is that?  Because my foot is all messed up. 
[00:08:00]  What happened to you?  Oh, great.  Thanks, Keith.  Jesus.  What happened to you?  I'll be taking next week off.  I could see the future.  Great.  Thanks, Keith.  Oh, God.  What happened to your throat?  What happened was, I was in Madison Square Garden.  I was there for the other day.  We had all these country singers for the awards.  The country music awards.  Right.  The crackers.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  The goddamn cracker-ass cracker awards is what that is. 
[00:08:30]  Bunch of cowboy hats.  There's a lot of racism in the country music association.  Oh, really?  Honey, I was about to faint all them damn people.  Mm-hmm.  I almost faint my hat.  Huh?  Why?  Were you excited to see the country stars?  Oh, hell yeah.  Really?  Hell yeah.  No doubt about it.  You don't seem like a country star fan.  Honey, I want rock, hip-hop, rap, whatever.  A little bit of everything. 
[00:09:00]  I listen to every bit of it.  What do you listen on?  I'm a 98.  Kiss FM.  Kiss FM, huh?  So, did you have a good seat at the awards?  I know.  I didn't go in, but we was out on the other side, because they had a red carpet.  Yeah.  All this limousine.  Yeah.  And all this kind of stuff.  Mm-hmm.  It was good.  Oh, so you were a spectator on the street there, right? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I was spectator.  Watching the limos pull off.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds like fun.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sounds like fun.  Yeah, and this nigga was standing right and moving around and moving around.  Let's get a motherfucking spot, motherfucker.  You're in my way, right?  Yeah.  God damn.  And everybody taking all these fucking pictures and all that kind of shit.  And this and I yelled, I said, ain't this a fucking goddamn.  Ain't it, though?  Ain't this a fucking goddamn.  I hear you.  I couldn't agree more, man.  Ain't this a shit.  I hear you.  Ain't this a shit. 
[00:10:00]  Now, Donna, I want to get into you a little bit here.  What happened in your life that left you out on the streets?  Well, what happened was, I'm a hard-headed bitch, okay?  Mm-hmm.  I raised up a nice family home.  All right.  Excuse me.  You're a little phlegmy.  Want to throw that can over here?  Once again, thanks, Keith.  We'll just disinfect the studio because of the coughing, you know. 
[00:10:30]  Excuse me.  Okay.  I like it to be germ-free.  Okay.  Anthony, you're very selfish with your germ barrier.  Oh, God damn.  You just sprayed it right around himself.  Oh, no, my God.  Why don't you help a brother out?  Help a brother out, man.  Raise the shield.  I don't believe you.  You've got to disinfect this area.  Oh, my God.  It was a half circle about six inches around his body.  I know.  You're coughing.  Because I was screaming out then.  What kind of stuff were you screaming at the country music people? 
[00:11:00]  Someone should just be holding this down.  Because I love all my hot-ass motherfucking men.  Please.  Yeah.  Who's the one you like the most?  Who do I like?  Garf Brooks?  Garf Brooks.  Garf.  Kenny Loggin.  Kenny Loggin?  And Jon Ben Jovi.  Jamei Ramsey?  What?  Jon Ben Jovi.  Oh, Bon Jovi.  Yeah.  He was down there.  Hell, yeah.  Jon Bon Jovi was down there? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  How about Kenny Rogers?  Kenny Rogers wasn't there.  If I would see him, I would not every fucking must have off his black ass.  Why does he, wow, I didn't know.  Why do you have a problem with Kenny Rogers?  Because he wasn't around.  I was listening to all these songs.  Yeah.  I said, and it stopped.  I don't know what happened.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Did you ever eat his chicken?  He makes a good chicken. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, Kenny Rogers roasted, right?  All right, let's get back into like Anthony was starting to.  Yeah, what happened now that left you out on the street?  You said you're hard-headed.  You were raised in a nice family, you said?  Nice family home.  Uh-huh.  Where, where?  In Elizabeth, New Jersey.  New Jersey, okay.  And my parents loved the hell out of me.  I mean, they'd give me an ass whooping.  Excuse my language.  They'd give me an ass whooping.  Every time I do something, they'd lay my ass out.  Uh-huh.  So I wasn't doing that shit no more. 
[00:12:30]  So when I was going, I was going to school and this and this thing,  and then I turned 18 and I got pregnant.  Uh-oh.  Pregnant.  By who?  Pregnant at 18.  One of my son's father.  One of my son's father.  One of her son's father.  Holy shit.  Yeah, one of my son's father.  Yeah.  How many kids do you have?  I got two.  You got two?  And how old are they now?  My oldest one is 14. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  And my other one is a year and a half.  A year and a half?  And now you're on the street.  Where do they stay?  They stay with my family members.  Oh, with your grandma or something?  My grandmother with my sister.  How come you don't stay with one of your family members?  Yeah, why not?  No.  They don't.  I don't like their fucking games.  Oh, that's you being the hard-headed.  Right, because I want to do the hell I do the hell I want to do.  Fuck them games.  Roof.  Damn, I'm going to the bus station.  And you got damn right. 
[00:13:30]  Those fucking games.  Fuck that.  Bed.  Climate control.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I hate them games too.  Showers.  Fuck.  Fuck them games.  Hell yeah.  Fireplace dimmers.  Shit.  Right.  Oh, shit.  So now you're 18.  You get pregnant.  Yeah.  And they throw you out?  No, they kept my ass home.  So how did you end up on the street is what I'm trying to...  Because I choose the life I want to live.  But who got you knocked up?  Was it a boyfriend at the time? 
[00:14:00]  No.  I did.  I decided to do the hell I wanted to do.  You decided you wanted to get knocked up at 18?  Mm-hmm.  And who was the guy?  Kevin Ford.  I had time to look for his ass.  I couldn't find his ass.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  And then I went back on it.  I went left home and this and that, I think.  It seems like you got into maybe, maybe, because I know a lot of people, especially  younger people that are not with their families on the streets, they get into things like  drugs.  You got something in your tooth? 
[00:14:30]  I got a toothache.  Excuse me.  You got a toothache?  He's really digging in there.  You got a dental plan?  And it hurt.  Some of them games like dental insurance?  Yeah, fuck that, man.  Put ice right here.  What happened?  Toothache?  Yeah, I got a toothache and it's killing me.  You got a dentist upstairs.  Maybe we'll take you up there.  My what?

See, now that's what I was getting at you.  Anything she would get her fucking hands on.  All right.  That's what I'm getting at you.  You get kicked out.  You don't get kicked out.  But when you're homeless, a lot of people fall into drugs. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  And that might have kept you out on the street now, right?  Oh, yeah.  You're addicted?  Mm-hmm.  What do you like?  Heroin?  I used to do heroin.  Yeah.  And I stopped for a while.  Then I started to switch up.  And what do you switch to?  Cocaine.  Cocaine.  Making a big comeback.  That's so 80s.  Coke.  And it's not pure anymore.  This shit is really good.  Good stuff?  No, it's not.  Rod Stewart admitted recently that the shit ain't as good as it used to be.  Shit.  Now it's good now.  Yeah, why? 
[00:16:00]  How do you buy your drugs?  How does she get the good shit?  Yeah, how do you buy your drugs?  How do you get your money?  I can't imagine the homeless lady gets the good connections.  I get all what the hell I want for.  How do you get the money, though?  You got to have money to buy the drugs.  Because I sell my ass for it.  That's how I sell it.  Ah, kid.  I got you.  I sell my ass for it.  You sell your ass.  The bill idea is starting to make more sense.  So a couple of, you know.  How old were you the first time you sold your ass?  Sell my ass?  I was 18. 
[00:16:30]  18.  Was this after Kevin Ford?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, head of the Ford Motor Company.  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  He had a two-on-one, him and Lee Iacocca.  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  So you sold your ass.  Did you have a pimp?  Or did you just walk on the street?  I had a pimp.  How'd you get a pimp?  Huh?  How'd you get a pimp?  I don't even fucking know.  Don't remember?  I don't even know.  He was the guy who had a little candy for you.  Where were you sitting?  Well, I was in Newark. 
[00:17:00]  Newark.  That's a good place to start.  That's a great city, man.  And I hooked up with them girls that'd be out there.  I'd be a long winter.  Now, wait.  You were a little hungry, probably.  You needed some dope.  You needed something.  Well, I said, well, I want to get on fucking crack.  So I was like, $10, this, nickel this, nickel down, whatever they want to do.  Uh-huh.  So I said, I might as well do my fucking goddamn thing.  Sell your ass.  So you went on the street. 
[00:17:30]  And I got a lot to fuck up.  First night?  First fucking night?  What an amateur.  This motherfucking rookie cop came up to me.  What was he, in uniform?  And he go, I suck your dick for $5.  I told him, look, give me fucking $10.  Guess what?  See this?  I'm an undercover cop.  I got in an undercover cop car.  I said, wait a minute.  You poached me.  And that heard me on the fucking radio. 
[00:18:00]  I got locked up.  Locked up.  Oh, man.  Damn.  I was hot.  I was heated.  Yeah.  I was fucking hot.  So you didn't get to, the first night out, you didn't even get to get laid and get some money.  I didn't get laid or nothing.  So I was in behind fucking bars.  So now you get out.  I want to know the first time where it worked out.  What'd you have to do?  Well.  You suck dick or you get fucked?  I suck and fucking.  Yeah, is that what you did?  Fucking my ass and fucking my coochie.  And your ass too?  Hell yeah.  Everything.  Hell yeah.

In the restroom, motherfucker.  But you haven't showered since when?  Seriously.  It's been a while for a shower.  It's been a while.  Could I be running around and rushing roulette and all this kind of shit? 
[00:26:00]  She's got shit to do.  How long, though?  How many weeks?  Months?  Is it months since you've seen the shower?  A couple months.  Donna, what?  Now, after sex.  Wow.  After you have sex.  After you have sex with a guy, what do you do to clean up the area down there a little bit?  Whatever.  You got to wash off a tissue, whatever you want.  A tissue or something?  Dirty sock?  Wash it off.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah, sock, whatever's down there.  She squats in a puddle.  Oh, my God. 
[00:26:30]  No, we're not going to make you have any sex.  Don't worry about that.  We just want one thing.  What?  Our buddy Bill over here wants to have you lay back, right?  Take your pants down.  Uh-huh.  And then he's going to get real close to your snatch and give a little sniff.  Oh, my God.  He's into that.  They're already puking in there.  He's into that.  Someone just ran out of the studio.  Dirk just ran out.  I just ran out of it.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, about that whole thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's just going to, because he's into that.  He's a freak.  He's a freak.  He don't want to touch you.  No touching.  He doesn't want to touch you.  He don't want you to touch him.  He just wants to see some action.  He wants to see.  Smell the action.  Real up close, though, he wants to see.  Yeah.  Oh, you want to see up close?  How much will that cost us today?  Don't try the sexy thing.  Let's just go right to the-  I'd give you $100 a piece.  No.  Well, what she'll give-  $20 a piece.  Nope.  Wow, she dropped real quick. 
[00:27:30]  No.  $20 a piece.  Nope, get out.  Oh.  $20 a piece.  Nope.  That's all.  Let's just not even negotiate.  Let's-  Yeah, because that might be illegal.  Let's just not even negotiate as far as money goes or anything.  Let's go.  It's Monopoly money.  Right.  That's what we're playing with.  Monopoly money.  I'll give you boardwalk.  I got it right here.  Now, I'm thinking we could get this done for a couple of the white bills or maybe the blue ones. 
[00:28:00]  Nothing over orange, though.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What?  What the?  I'm thinking to sit down.  No, don't.  Yeah, why don't you just-  To sit down.  That just really made it-  Because no one's going to touch you, right?  Okay.  And you're not going to touch anybody.  I ain't going to touch anybody.  He's just going to, like, really get close and kind of take a good look. 
[00:28:30]  Uh-huh.  And, you know, that's what we're figuring.  Holy cow.  Really?  That's what we're figuring.  What is that?  But there's no work involved.  What is that?  You know what that is.  That's Kennelly.  This is a famous president called Alexander Hamilton.  Now, what is that?  What kind of hookup did he have to get on the money?  Alexander Hamilton?  Yeah.  I believe he's on a denomination of a-  That's $50 on that $10.  No, that's not.  That's a tenner.  It ain't no $50.  I'll tell you that. 
[00:29:00]  You take it in the ass for $20.  Yeah.  You just lay in there.  All right.  I will match my friend's contribution.  Can you do the math?  I think.  It's $11.  $11.  That's right.  She does know me very well.  $11.  $11.  Now, he's not going to do anything.  There's no touching here, mind you.  No.  He's not going to touch.  Easiest trick you ever turn.  You just lay there.  Okay.  So, now, all you got to do is get up, take the pants off, and lay down over there. 
[00:29:30]  That's right.  Okay.  Hold on.  That's it.  Okay.  That's it.  Okay.  And we're all good.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  God damn.

Yeah, you might as well just take the whole God damn thing right.  Usually, we love when the women take off their shirts.  Those pits are very hairy.  Wow. 
[00:30:00]  You're a natural woman, aren't you?  I've never seen Afro puffs in an armpit.  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Wow.  Look at that.  Yeah, baby.  Look at.  Oh, yeah.

[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Uh-huh.  He got you.  Nice.  He got you.  That's some sweet chocolate.  Holy mother.  I don't even think he's got to get close.  All right.  Now, if you would, Donna, if you'd lay back.  Lay back on the Liberator.  All right.  All right.  Hey, anybody see Harry and the Hendersons?  Yeah, baby.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, my God.  You sure you're not giving birth right now?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Bill.  Bill, you look a little nervous. 
[00:31:00]  I just want to get this over with.  Now, all right.  Why does it look like she's giving birth to an ABA player?  You got a lot of hair down there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're hairy down there.  Look at you.  You're ready for your beauty shots, I see.  Now, yeah, she's being all glamorous down there.  She's feeling like a woman down there.  She looks like metal arc lemon.  That's wonderful.  Now, what we need is...  Holy crap. 
[00:31:30]  Bill.  We don't even have to do the bit anymore.  Bill.  All right, baby.  Now, Donna, we're going to need you to really, when he gets ready, to get a real close look  down there, we need you to what they call spirit him.  We need you.  You know what that's all about, right?  No.  We need her.  Yeah, like that.  Oh, my God.  Just like that.  I can't wait to see the video of this.  Yeah, baby.  All right, listen.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, get in the birthing position.  You can smell her at the fish market.  It's amazing, isn't it?  Holy crap.  This is fucking unbelievable.  This is amazing.  All right, wow.  Wow, look at those socks.  They used to be white, right?  Yeah, leave them on.  Leave them on.  All right.  Yeah, leave them white.  Leave them on.  That's sexy.  No, actually, I think you need to take the socks off.  Oh, my honey.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  My honey is good.  Yeah, they're good.  All right, man.  And my toes.  Holy shit. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  We haven't talked to Crazy Bill.  Bill?  Hey, how's it going?  Bill, man.  How's it going, man?  You up for this?  Yeah, yeah.  Just tell me why now.  All right.  Wait.  You might want to get a bucket over there.  Someone place the bucket.  Nah, he's fine.  Are you ready?  See, this is the type of stuff people should be downloading to their iPod, by the way, Anthony.  Right.  Now, this is the perfect thing that would be like iPod stuff.  This would be a perfect iPod bit that you could download to your iPod if you didn't get that deal done. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Now, Bill, turn around and take a look at the lovely lady here and see what to do.  Yeah, look at that.  All right.  All right.  She's in the prison.  I'm freezing through my mouth and I can still smell her.  She's spreading them.  Oh, my God.  All right, Bill, walk up now and kneel, kneel down right between legs.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bill, Bill, slow and romantic.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to get.  Please.  Can we get. 
[00:33:30]  What's the matter, O?  Someone should get over there to make sure he does it.  Oh.  Hey, Bill.  Someone's over here.  And keep the mic right by your face because we want to hear, you know, coming out of your nostrils and shit.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter?  What's the matter, Bill?  I just want to get this over with.  You are really pale.  Are you real pale?  Look how white he's getting.  Are you hot?  Are you sweating?  Are you need a water or nothing?  Bill, he's a little nervous, you know.  You know if you're going to do this, you've got to do this, right?  I'm doing it.  You can't puss out.  Get the puss out.  Get the puss out over here. 
[00:34:00]  Get the.  Get the.  Are the buckets closed?  It's supposed to fucking livestock in here.  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  Let me set the scene for everybody.  What's her name?  Donna.  Donna is completely nude on the Liberator.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She's got her legs spread like she's going to give birth.  Yep.  Totally.  Like I said, she looks like she's giving birth to an NBA player down there.  Yeah.  That is some muff, girl.  Yeah.  Reminds me of Ben Wallace. 
[00:34:30]  It's mini Ben Wallace.  I've never seen a pussy with a headband.  You're right.  Yeah.  All right.  Woo!  Okay, Bill.  Oh, my.  Are you ready?  Any last words?  Any last words?  Just tell me when.  All right.  Get the mic right down there.  Get the mic down there.  Get the camera.  We're all going to be quiet now.  We're all going to be quiet.  Let's all be quiet.  Shh.  Should I go from that end over?  Because we'll guard the museum.  Yeah.  Whatever's going to make it.  Just kneel down.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to get this on tape.  This is something that.  Looks like Lionel Richie.  Eventually will be downloadable to your video iPod. 
[00:35:00]  I think.  No.  He's going for the side.  I think he's got to.  No.  Straight on.  Straight on, baby.  Get on your knees.  You've got to go straight on.  Straight on.  Straight on.  Get on your knees.  Hey, we haven't talked.  Can we mic her a little better?  Donna, you ready?  Yeah, I'm ready.  All right.  Yeah.  Kind of get your.  You've got to lay down almost on the front of the Liberator there, Bill.  Lay down a little.  Lay down a little.  Yeah.  Donna, don't touch him.  Yeah, he's very shy. 
[00:35:30]  He's a shy boy there, Donna.  He's shy.  No touching.  Now, kind of lay down on the Liberator in front of her.  There you go.  And just.  All right.  This could be good.  Get your face right in there.  Yeah.  Get the mic right down there.  All right.  Shh.  Big whip.  Big whip.  He's tearing.  Wow.  He's tearing.  You all right, Bill? 
[00:36:00]  You all right?  There's no color in his face left.  You all right there, Bill?  I'm good.  Wow.  Ta-da.  The aristocrat.  Yeah, I'm done.  You are something, man.  You are the best intern ever.  Well, he's got to now explain for the audience, Bill.  What's that?  Can I put my clothes back on?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  It should have been on already.  If we could get that over there. 
[00:36:30]  There we go.  Yeah, you can put them clothes on.  Job well done.  Bill, what if you could please just try to relate to us what that was like?  I wish I knew the proper adjectives to describe this, but it's just rotten, festering.  Yeah.  Like the halls of ABC No Rio just smells like terrible body odor.  What is it, Dennis Miller now? 
[00:37:00]  Disgusting.  He looks like you might pass out.  I'm good.  Now, what does it smell like, though?  Give us something to...  Old cum.  There's a lot of jism in there just wiped with a tissue, I think.  Right?  Yeah.  A smell that...  McDonald's dumpster.  McDonald's dumpster.  McDonald's dumpster.  I never...  Never, right?  Yeah.  Absolutely not.  I'd be insulted if I was you, Donna.  That's an insult.  That's an insult. 
[00:37:30]  You might as well take that back before I'd not deliver hell out of you.  Yeah.  No, you dare.  Yeah.  Just in case you didn't hear, he says your pussy smells like a McDonald's dumpster.  No, in a good way.  My pussy ain't smell like McDonald's.  No wonder it's only $10.  Yeah, man.  I'd be pissed off.  Wow.  You'd ever suck my body for anything.  Yeah.  Okay?  That's right.  You wouldn't even dare suck my feelings like that.  No.  Because I love this.  My mother gave me this.  Yeah, Donna, what do you think it smells like? 
[00:38:00]  You broke it.  And you ruined it.  I ain't fucking ruin it.  What do you think it smells like?  She heard you.  Shit.  What do you know?  Every man I want, every man I want, they love it.  That's right.  They love it.  You ever think they're just saying that?  No.  They mean that.  Because I'm a West Wild woman.  We should have had her up with her ass up in the air and sniffed the ass.  Well, I was, I was, I was, that's, that's, that's the, that, that, that's what I wanted  to say. 
[00:38:30]  The sequel?  Yeah.  But I don't know if Bill has it in him for what?  Bill, what if she was to just pull her pants down, put her ass up in the air on the liberate,  and then you, you know, just sniff that ass.  Oh, no.  Just smell, smell the, any different or any.  Yes.  Let's see how close he can get to it.  And we'll bet.  Smell the $20 area.  To the, yeah, right, right to the brown eye.  Yeah, that was a $10 area.  All right.  Get naked again.  We got more.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  We got more of that.  You can leave your shirt on. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, we don't need to see those.  You can leave your shirt on.  And Bill Burr has to be a foot away from me watching.  No, that ain't gonna happen.  Bill, you gotta get over there.  I agree.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Bill's a trooper.  Bill rocks, man.  He's gonna have my back in case.  All right.  Wow, you can make soup with those panties.  Now, actually, spin the liberator around so that we can use the liberator's shape.  You see how the kind of thing bubbles there?  I want her bent over that thing.  Oh, come on, Anthony.  Now you've gone too far. 
[00:39:30]  Well, I'm directing because this has to be done properly.  There you go.  Spin it around.  By the way, can I make an announcement?  Yeah.  Next time you see Bill out and about at an O&A event, please buy all his liquor for him.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't make him pay for anything.  Don't make him ever pay for liquor again because he's taking it for the team big time today.  Donna, what we need you to do, see how that thing's round?  We need you to just lay over it like you were going to be taking it in the air.  I think she knows that position very well, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep your feet on the ground. 
[00:40:00]  You're explaining that position to her?  Now, slide down a little more.  Hawk, have her go back more.  Have her go back more.  Go back.  Go back.  Keep going.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  There you go.  Now, now, yeah, there you are.  Holy shit.  All right.  Bill, what's the problem?  Bill Burr.  Do you see your target?  How could you miss it?  Oh, my God.  Now, he's not going to touch you, Donna.  All right.  And you're not going to touch him.  He's just going to kind of put his face in there and give a few sniffs. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Could you spread your cheeks apart, though, Donna?  Like, spread them.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Now, hold like that.  Whoa.  Why do you always have to look for some reason?  You just have to look.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Donna.  Yeah.  Once again, when was the last time you had a shower?  The shower was, like, months, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, when was the last time you really took care of the back door?  I always care of the back door. 
[00:41:00]  I always do.  You always take care of it.  I always do.  Bill, does it look like she takes care of the back door?  I always take care of the back door.  Bill.  You asshole.  I never be letting go back.  You asshole.  Bill.  I don't fuck.  Rick.  Does it look like.  Hold on.  Bill needs a mic.  Does it look like she takes care of the back door?  No.  I'm saying no.  What seems to be.  Oh, God.  Damn.  But the back door looks fully operational.  Right.  Still in use.  Back to the mic. 
[00:41:30]  Your ass.  Because I refuse to take a glance at that.  What is the problem back there?  Nothing really that I can see through the tears in my eyes.  But she has a lot.  Well, you have a lot of ass sex, though, back there.  Yeah.  So it might be a little, like, stretched.  Does it look like an exploding cigar back there?  Or an exploding cigar?  No.  Okay.  No.  I'm going to make a smell.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's get this over.  It looks like Mount St. Helens.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now, lean over like that.  Yeah.  Spread them apart.  Uh-huh. 
[00:42:00]  But don't fall off.  Yeah.  Spread them cheeks.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now, hey, could you turn your hat backwards?  Could you turn your hat backwards a little bit, Bill?  Because so the bill of your hat doesn't.  Yeah.  There you go.  And let's get that nose right.  Real.  As close as you can get.  Oh, my God.  Closer.  Closer.  Oh, my God.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  You're almost there.  You're almost there.  We need you one inch away, Bill.  One more time.  One more time.  One inch away.  One inch. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Woo.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He likes that.  Wow.  All right.  Bill.  Bill.  Step up to the mic.  Wow.  Back here.  I swear to you.  Back here.  Oh, God.  We'll be back tomorrow with another Opie and Anthony show.

That's some ass.  Holy shit.  Dude.  Holy shit.  What, it just hit you?  Well, when you move into the blast zone, yeah, it's the blast zone.  That's yours, baby.  There you go.  And now, Bill.  That was a pussy dirty ball.

Is it still like kind of in your nasal passages?  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  It's still in the back of his throat.  Please keep it in here.  Don't let nobody out there know about you.  Uh-uh.  Okay?  What goes on?  That would destroy your reputation.  It's a fresh-smelling whore. 
[00:44:00]  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  Well, I got to say, that's something.  That's your question.  And everyone's happy, right?  Yep.  The listeners are happy.  They got to hear some fun radio.  You're happy because you get, you know.  I'm happy, honey.  And Bill is, uh.  Well, I'm sorry.  Someone's got to lose.  Well, I do live my life a quarter mile at a time, so.  Yeah.  There he goes.  That's his philosophy, Molly.  Thank you, Bill.  Bill, thank you so much.  Woo!  Peace be with you.  All right.

Yeah, there you go.  Just open the window and throw the Liberator out the window.  Please.  What we should have done was left her in here.  And, uh, is that off out there?  Just so we can, you know.

Yeah, and we get the fuck out of the studio.  The studio is amazing.  The things he does for this program.  He is a trooper.  He's still too smooth, though, man.  We need a guy that's really going to start hacking and puking.

Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  Tell us where, tell us when, and tell us what those delicious boobies look like.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we just might use it on the air.  Ooh!  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language. 
[00:50:30]  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let me unzip.  You know how we talk about the woman that just ruins every radio show?  Yeah.  We had Moya.  No!  You hear it in the Howard clips where she has absolutely nothing to add of substance except stuff that you could read in a paper. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Well, someone, I guess this is sassy, came up with this bit, isolating the typical female on a radio show.  Right.  Just isolating what a female would be saying as the guys are doing all the heavy lifting.  Guys doing heavy lifting, trying to get edgy, talking openly, and there's always that woman in studio to keep everyone under control.  The mother figure.  The balance.  Of course.  To get the ladies listening.  Right. 
[00:51:30]  This is everything that the PDs that know nothing about broadcasting think is the way to go.  You gotta have a room full of guys?  No, you gotta put a girl in there, a woman in there to keep you all in check.  Why?  When you're hanging with your friends and you're laughing, how many times does the chick come in and fucking contribute?  Just wreck it.  All they do is their energy is just not funny.  It stinks.  It's just completely nurturing and dull.  We've heard it before. 
[00:52:00]  And when you hear the woman in the mix, it sounds like she's part of the show.  But if you actually isolate what they're doing, you realize they have nothing to add.  Absolutely nothing to add.  So, this person, Sassy, came up with this bit.  It would be just a woman isolated as the guys are doing the heavy lifting on a radio show.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Well, I was just about to say...  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Uh-huh.  You know, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.  Uh-huh.  Now, now.  Hold on.  You're gonna get us all in trouble.  Oh, well, you get your mind out of the gutter.  Oh, that's perfect.  No, that's not right. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, that's...  Oh, you guys have to stop.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, please.  Women only do that in porno movies.  Uh.  You know, you're right.  Y-Yes.  Uh-huh.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  This is very accurate, by the way.  Oh.  Oh.  Great.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Oh.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  No.  Come on.  That's too mean.  Come on.  Stop.  Ha-ha.  Guys.  I can't take this.  I...  I gotta say, you gotta stop.  Hey, I have a good sense of humor and all, but I just don't think it's funny to make fun of the mentally challenged.  Ew, what's so funny about flatulence anyway?  Oh, come on. 
[00:54:00]  I swear, you guys have such a one-track mind.  Perfect.  Yeah, well, you may think it's funny, but I just have to draw the line.  I mean, some things should just not be talked about and aren't funny.  You're going to hurt somebody's feelings, and I don't think that's the right thing to do.  Stop it.  No, no, it's not funny.  Oh, I'll tell you what the problem with those magazines is.  Real women do not look like that.  Yeah, well, if I had a trainer and I had somebody doing my hair and makeup all day, I would look like a supermodel too, you know? 
[00:54:30]  Come on, stop drooling.  You know, if I was a man, I would choose Hillary Clinton over Pamela Anderson any day of the week.  I think a real man likes a strong, powerful, intelligent woman.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  How do you know God was a man?  Yeah, right. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, please.  Of course.  Well, they didn't know that.  I knew it.  That's a, yes, of course.  Naturally.  I know.  I swear, you're all just like little boys.  When are you just going to grow up already?  Yeah, well, if that were me, I would just have to pull a Lorena Bobbitt.  Bravo. 
[00:55:30]  Perfect.  How good is that?  Perfect.  Useless meat slot.  How good is that?  Just that, just that little, just keep everybody in line.  Yeah.  Just the voice of reason.  Oh.  Representing the ladies out there.  Stop now.  Is that how ladies want to be represented?  Tee hee, that's me.  The unfunny cock blocker.  Is that really representative of most of you? 
[00:56:00]  All right.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and the best is Lady Diane Marion, so you can  imagine the worst.  All right, let's go get Steve.  Steve, of course, owns a hybrid vehicle.  Steve bought one of these hybrid cars.  They run on gas, a little bit of gas, and electric power, and they're supposed to get  all kinds of miles per gallon.  Hi, Steve.  Oh, he has no place to land.  Oh, look, he's looking around. 
[00:56:30]  There he is.  Oh, there you go.  He found a little spot.  There he goes.  Nice.  He found a place.  Thank you.  Hey, Steve.  Finally landed.  Well, yeah, Steve has a hybrid car.  What's it called?  It's Toyota Prius.  Toyota Prius.  Very popular now.  A lot of people are buying this to conserve fuel.  Runs on gas and electric.  I guess the electric motor takes over when you're, what, going slow or going fast?  The electric motor takes over around 30, 25 miles an hour, and when you're putzing  around the city.  Putzing around the city, and then on the other times it runs on that little bit of gas. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Well, I'm reading.  I was hoping this article wouldn't make it in here.  I'm reading this article that you are not alone.  I know I'm not alone.  In your love for hybrid vehicles.  I've seen plenty of them on the road.  Let me just say, at least you have a 25% chance.  Hey, let me ask you, is there, like, when you pull in, is there a rest area, like,  is that where you get your, like, fuel and stuff from?  No, I go to, like, regular little gas stations, yes.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  At least it's not 100%, Steve.  So, you know, you can hope for the 25%. 
[00:57:30]  And they say they start off the arc with, it's a little-known fact.  No, not at all.  It's a little-known fact.  It's pretty obvious.  Well, I like the headline right here.  Gay Americans favor hybrid electric vehicles.  You know, I wondered why I was getting so many waves from other people in hybrids.  Were you waving?  People wave.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a common thing I'm seeing.  When I see, like, another Prius or another hybrid vehicle, they look over and they go like  this.  They wave.  You know, they sort of wave like that.  I wonder if that's because, like, gay men are, like, an odd hybrid between male and  female sensibilities.  And this is kind of a hybrid between... 
[00:58:00]  It represents them.  ...like power, which is the gasoline engine, and electric, which is a vagina.  I think that's a stretch.  Let it be known that Derek is playing this, not me.  I know.  This is on the radio, no matter what station you tune in.  Yeah.  I'll give him a good smack later.  He's constantly playing over the sound system.  Oh.  All right, Anthony.  It's a little-known fact, but U.S. gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender consumers buy cars.  What's more, they show a penchant for the luxury end of the market and are significantly 
[00:58:30]  more interested in hybrid electric vehicles than their non-gay counterparts.  How do they figure this out, though?  I didn't get a sexual orientation quiz when I bought the...  Listen, it was obvious when you walked in.  Maybe because the gay gay guys know how bad gas can be.  You know, if you pull your helmet out and, you know, sorry.  Wow.  Why doesn't he get crashed there?  After you bought the car, did you and your boyfriend go to Ikea and buy furniture?  No.  Thanks, Rich.  That's a gay guy.  You could have let me suffer alone on that one. 
[00:59:00]  Jimmy, come back into the game.  That's right.  Coach calls you out.  One of the selling points is the headroom between the seat and the steering wheel, though.  It doesn't say that.  There you go.  Thank you, man.  I thought that was funny.  Headroom between the seat and the steering wheel.  Sorry.  Oh, headroom.  I'm an idiot.  I'm getting nothing.  Wow.  Shit.  Try it again.  Push that joke down with my finger.  Help a joke.  Help a joke. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  That's a study, I guess, that Harris Interactive did.  And a survey actually proves nothing more than homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgender  homosexuals have jobs, taste, and money to which to indulge them.  Well, the money thing is, the money thing I knew, because a lot of gay guys have disposable  income, because they're not supporting families.  So, unlike you, who are married, I want to make that point very clear. 
[01:00:00]  And they don't have disposable income.  That money that should be wasted on tuition goes right into medication.  Goes into long hospital stays.  Let's see.  Apparently, Volkswagen, Subaru, Volvo, and BMW are seen as the firms that extend the greatest  outreach to the gay and lesbian, bisexual, transgender community.  Though they're marketing, through their marketing campaigns.  Are there that many obvious queens walking into car dealerships and buying hybrids? 
[01:00:30]  I just, I don't know.  I don't know.  Regarding hybrid electric vehicles, 51% of the gay community considers it worth paying  the extra for the technology, compared with just 34% of non-cocksuckers.  Well, there you have it.  Wow.  The latest hybrid story, yeah.  Who would have guessed that?  Anybody.  Anybody.  Oh, he can't get out of here fast enough. 
[01:01:00]  There you go, Steve.  Martini Poland.  Oh.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve the Bear.  Sweet face, so cozy. 
[01:01:30]  We go back to his place, and in his cave, he shows me his flame hat.  I wonder how he can wear that.  Wonder how many cubs got caught in his bear trap.  His flaming clothes are exotic, homoerotic, and like Steve, they should've never came out  the closet.  But if you wear it, the sideburn's gotta be in good shape.  Can't be a cozy bear if your hair don't look great.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve.  Steve the Bear.  That's the OPN Anthony Show.

[01:03:30]  And now, a minute with the New York Times.  Here's book review editor Sam Tannenhaus.  On the cover of this week's book review,  in 1992, Francis Fukuyama's book,  The End of History and the Last Man,  established him as a leading neoconservative thinker.  But in 2004, with the Iraq occupation going badly,  and many on the right slow to admit it,  Fukuyama broke ranks with them and charted his own course.  His new book, America at the Crossroads,  is really two books in one,  a concise primer on neoconservative ideology, 
[01:04:00]  and a meditation on foreign policy  that advocates a more nuanced and flexible approach  to combating terrorism and radical Islam.  Among neoconservative thinkers,  Fukuyama has surely been the most imaginative,  the most playful, and the most ambitious,  says our reviewer Paul Berman,  who believes Fukuyama's soul-searching  may express a larger mood among political intellectuals just now,  and not only on the right.  On the bestseller list,  Jeffrey Archer's false impression  enters the fiction list at number eight.  This is Sam Tannenhaus for the New York Times. 
[01:04:30]  Ron and Fez, weekdays 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on XM202.  What are you doing for a vacation, Ronnie?  The usual.  The usual?  Then did you remember to pack rags in ether?  I knew I forgot something.  What would I do without you, Fezzy?  Probably rape less.  Ron Bennington, Fez Watley.  It's the Ron and Fez Show,  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast,  8 a.m. to 11 a.m. on the West Coast,  right after Opie and Anthony on XM Channel 202.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:05:00]  Did I just fart?  All right, we've got to move on to other things.  Is he here?  Oh, yeah, okay.  I guess that's him.  Harry Reams.  Wow.  I thought he was one of the executives  here at XM Satellite Radio.  Want to get him in here?  He's in a suit.  Gray hair looking all distinguished.  Why is he wearing a suit?  Because he's a, well, suit jacket.  A suit?  You're wearing a suit.  It's a suit jacket. 
[01:05:30]  Are you going to play golf?  Now that's an idea.  Wow.  Wow.  You look like Judge Smales from Caddyshack.  All right.  What can I tell you?  I'm old.  No, that's wonderful.  You're not eight years old.  You're not old, bro.  You just got the suit jacket that scared us.  That's all.  It looks like a million bucks.  That's Bob Kelly.  How you doing?  I'm just, how you doing, buddy?  Nice to miss you.  You looks like a million bucks.  That's Opie.  You really do.  What's up, bro?  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  And that's Anthony over there.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  And that's Harry Reams.  So I got a bill, an Anthony.  Bob.  Bob Anthony.  Anthony Opie.  Hold on one second, though.  Hold on.  Pass the bong.  I mean, I don't.  Did a vile, stupid bill come with your Opie and Anthony t-shirt?  No, it came with the proprietary technology.  32, after the hour here on the...  Every time I pop up to TV, he's mentioning our name. 
[01:06:30]  That's hysterical.  It's like one big commercial for this program today.  Harry, what's going on there?  Good morning.  Good morning, New York City.  Good morning.  A legend in the studio.  Yes.  I am thrilled.  I just saw your movie recently.  Which way?  I hadn't seen Deep Throat since it came out.  Don't we have the clips from Deep Throat still?  Thank you, sir.  That's why you look so awful.  I look awful?  Oh, you know.  I look awful. 
[01:07:00]  People like me who see these movies, we look like a million bucks.  It's inflation, my friend.  It's taking away on your million.  Keep it clean.  How, uh, we were wondering, how long were you in the porno business?  Oh, I started in 67, maybe 68.  67, and when did you finish up with that business?  The last film I did was 85.  85.  How the hell did you survive?  With AIDS, pretty much, that was the real huge time where no one really knew about it, 
[01:07:30]  but people were, you know, fucking.  We could use that word because it's satellite, my friend.  And, uh, uh, a lot of the porno industry, uh, was, was dropping dead of the AIDS.  So the question is, how did I survive?  How the hell did you survive?  Was it just luck of the draw?  Large quantities of alcohol.  You think alcohol is, uh.  Alcohol kills the, uh.  The AIDS virus?  I didn't know that.  That's good to know.  I wasn't part of the lifestyle.  I mean, I made the movies.  Dr. Reams.  Most of the people, yeah, most of the people that were in the movies went off and partied 
[01:08:00]  with drugs and booze, and after they finished shooting on a set.  Yeah, but you were having sex with them.  But you're having sex with these people.  Yeah, but this is before AIDS.  I actually didn't do a movie from 76 to 82.  No?  Not a, not a porno movie.  Right.  It was mostly over in Europe.  And everyone knows AIDS started around 85.  Yeah.  I was actually.  About 85.  I don't know what you know about me, but I became a real low-bottom alcoholic, which  is why I have this voice.  What's a low-bottom alcoholic?  Half a gallon a day.  Of what? 
[01:08:30]  Vodka.  Half a gallon?  Yeah.  How are you alive?  No food?  That's the miracle.  I'm not even kidding.  Today, I'm 16 and a half years clean and sober.  I got a new life.  Well, you got it.  You got to applaud that.  Everyone does.  It's just what you do.  Yeah.  I turn my life around.  A half a gallon of vodka.  Yeah.  I found the rooms of a 12-step program, and that's all I'll call it.  But it taught me a new way of life.  Yeah.  I put God in my life.  I'm happily married.  I own and operate a very successful real estate brokerage. 
[01:09:00]  That's what you look like.  You look like a real estate guy.  Oh, wow.  You really do.  That's the look you're at.  You're absolutely right.  And I live in God's country, Park City, Utah.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you get recognized?  Well, everybody knows me.  Really?  It's a small town of 7,000 year-rounders.  Is it Mormons?  A bunch of Mormons?  Are you Mormons?  No, not up there.  No?  No.  The rest of Utah is.  That's why I call it an oasis in a desert.  Right.  Do you put your picture up on the real estate signs when it's sold by, and then you put your  old 70s porno mustache picture up? 
[01:09:30]  Nobody up there knows me.  That'd be cool.  I mean, they all know who I am and what I did, but today I'm a highly regarded real  estate broker.  Yeah.  And operate a good company.  So you started in 1967.  Yeah.  What kind of porno were they doing in 1967?  Back then, they were doing what we called loops, 10-minute black and white, soundless  epics that premiered at Kiwanis Clubs or something.  A lot of hair, right?  A lot of hair.  Everyone was very bushy and hairy.  Yeah, we were all very hairy.  They had this huge mustache.  Yeah.  And then I'm Curious Yellow challenged the existing obscenity laws, came in from Denmark. 
[01:10:00]  It was found not to be obscene, so all the guys making those little 10-minute films  started to make feature-length films.  They were what they called the stag reels before that, right?  The stag films before that.  Yeah.  And then there was the white coders.  What was that?  I am Curious Yellow won because it proved it had, quote, social redeeming value.  So, the American filmmakers always had a doctor.  And I played the doctor a hundred times before Deep Throat.  Yeah, you were always the doctor. 
[01:10:30]  And I'd sit there and say, if you're having problems with oral sex, here's how you do it.  And it would cut to a stag film that was made five years earlier.  And then Deep Throat came along, and what gave it its success was really that it spoofed  the white coders.  It had no pretense of having social redeeming value.  Yeah.  But again, you were the doctor.  The crazy doctor was me, and it was the first time we played him for comedy.  Yeah.  So, that was the groundbreaker right there. 
[01:11:00]  How'd you get into that business, especially back then?  I was working in the theater here in New York.  Yeah.  I had worked at La Mama and WPA, Bleecker Street Theater.  I was doing a little stint with the National Shakespeare Company, and I'm making $78 and  change a week under an actor's equity associate.  Was that good back then?  Actor's equity associate.  Was that good back then?  No, it was scale.  So, another actor said, I know where you can pick up a hundred bucks for one hour.  And I went and did it and never looked back. 
[01:11:30]  Jesus.  I was a little repressed Jewish kid out of Westchester.  Wow.  Were you any good?  So, I did not have a lot of sexual experience.  Were you any good, the first one, the first movie?  We won't go into that.  No?  Well, I went into that, but, you know.  You didn't last that long, did you?  Next.  Wow.  And then, you said you turned your life around.  What was the bottom?  Because everyone's got the story where you had to turn it around.  Here's the bottom.  I was drinking excessively, to say the least. 
[01:12:00]  And I was in bucks.  Were you always a drinker, and then it just escalated, really?  It really started when I was on trial in Memphis.  I used to leave the courtroom.  You guys didn't do your homework.  We like to hash this out live on the air with our guests.  We do it differently, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's the trial in Memphis about?  Let me back you up for a minute.  I went on trial for 12 weeks with eight members of the Colombo family in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee.  I'd never been there.  The film just flew over the state.  It was forum shopped into Memphis. 
[01:12:30]  And I was on trial for, quote, conspiracy to transport interstate obscene materials.  They were trying to hold an actor or an artist responsible for the distribution of their product.  And what year was this?  The trial started in 75.  I got arrested here in New York in my apartment in Chelsea.  Three FBI agents broke down the door at four in the morning.  Wow.  Next thing I know, I'm on an airplane going to Memphis, Tennessee, and I find out that I'm being held responsible for the distribution of a film. 
[01:13:00]  So I alerted the entire entertainment community.  Everybody backed the issue.  They didn't necessarily back me, but the effects were chilling.  With an organized crime family.  Yeah, I was on trial with eight of these guys.  Yeah, wow.  They all were with the Colombo family.  They were the distributors of Deep Throat.  I didn't know it when I made it.  Of course, this was the pioneer days of porno in the United States.  They were the original distributors of that movie?  Yeah, and the producers.  Was it on Colombo crime?  Yeah, in fact, Linda Lovelace and the director, Jerry Damiano, were witnesses against me. 
[01:13:30]  Wow, wow.  Can you imagine that?  I'm on trial for the distribution of the film, and the director, producer, and the star are pointing the finger at me and said, yeah, he had sex with me on film.  Give it a rest, man.  We didn't need to hear you.  You should have shoved your cock in the mouth.  So anyhow, they proved murder.  They proved tax evasion.  They proved, oh, they were beating people that took the money at the box office every night with baseball bats. 
[01:14:00]  Wow, shake them down.  Shake them down.  And I'm on trial for these crimes.  All you did was make a movie.  Well, here's the conspiracy laws, and this is the broadest use of the conspiracy laws in the history of the United States to this day.  Two or more people acting in conjunction to commit a crime, all right?  Hypothetically, you have knowledge the president's going to be shot tomorrow, and you don't legally disavow and destroy that. 
[01:14:30]  You're now a conspirator.  You don't call the authorities.  You go on trial for murder.  So I knew the film was in distribution, but it wasn't obscene where we shot it in Florida.  It wasn't obscene up where I lived in Westchester.  It was obscene in New York City, which I find curious.  Especially in 70s.  Yeah, so they were trying to hold me responsible for this whole thing, and it was really an organized crime trial.  It should have been.  They proved murder.  They proved brutalizing people.  They proved tax evasion. 
[01:15:00]  They just wanted to bring a face into it.  There's a scene in this DVD where one of the FBI informants walks into this room, and this was shown in video at the trial, and he has a little camera in his briefcase, and he walks in this room full of money.  I mean, loaded to the ceiling.  He turns to a couple of guys, and he says, how do you know how much is here?  He said, we don't.  We don't count it.  We weigh it.  $600 million.  Wow.  Escaped the United States.  Never paid taxes on it. 
[01:15:30]  And because I made such a furor, I made such a fuss over an artist, good or bad of any kind, being responsible for the distribution of his materials, the conviction was overturned when Carter took office.  If the Republicans stayed in office, I'm in jail.  But were you convicted at first?  Yeah, convicted and sentenced to five years.  Five years on your experience.  Then I got Alan Gershowitz out of Harvard, one of the great First Amendment attorneys, and he said, keep this thing public.  So I did fundraisers all over the country with celebrities that came and supported the issue, not necessarily me. 
[01:16:00]  And eventually the Democrats took the office, took the White House, and one of the first acts Jimmy Carter did was to overturn the conviction against me.  He was a big fan of your movies.  He's a big fan of freedom.  So I overturned the conviction, the conviction, and then dismissed.  That was his first order of business.  And then I had two other indictments coming.  Yeah.  One for Devil and Miss Jones, one for Memories within Miss Aggie. 
[01:16:30]  These were adult films back in the early 70s.  And all of it got dismissed.  I find it interesting, and the DVD, which is both R-rated for the timid, and if you want to see the real deal, get the NC-17.  What does the NC-17 include that the R-rated doesn't?  Clips of the movie?  Blowjobs.  Can you never do that sound again, please?  It was the creepiest blowjob sound I've ever heard.  But anyhow, here's the difference in culture in America right now. 
[01:17:00]  30 years ago in Memphis, Tennessee, the federal government prosecuted me for the distribution of Deep Throat.  Convicted me, too.  I was in Memphis three days ago doing some press to kick off this.  You know, I'm out promoting the release of this DVD, and it's great.  It's really good.  And I go into my hotel room, and it's one of the landmark hotels in Memphis.  It's called the Peabody Hotel with the ducks in the lobby and, you know, just a gorgeous old historic hotel. 
[01:17:30]  I get to my room.  I turn on the TV.  Right in front of my face, it says, when I went to the section for movies, they had three or four general releases.  They had about 50 porno titles, including Deep Throat, the original version.  Yep.  You go to the Peabody Hotel, folks, in Memphis, Tennessee, for $11.99, you can see that film.  Did you watch it?  I don't know if I really ever saw it from beginning to end.  You pay for it?  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, I did the movie.  I'll actually say that.  I used to tell the producers, because I was in the after-hutens, don't use my real name, which is Herb Stryker. 
[01:18:00]  And so they made up names for me.  Dick Hurt, Peter Long.  You know, all these.  So the first time I got-  Herb Stryker is a great porno name.  That is a good porno name, too.  Herb Stryker.  But anyhow, on the movie Deep Throat, the name Harry Reams pops up.  Suddenly the phone is ringing.  All over the world, people are asking me to do movies.  So I kept the name.  But I find it ironic that today you can go into Memphis, Tennessee, and rent this-  Where you were brought- 
[01:18:30]  From one of the most conservative hotels and historic landmarks of the South.  Come a long way, sir.  Time does roll on, doesn't it?  It does.  Go ahead.  Anyway, this DVD-  Getting great reviews, by the way.  Yo, fabulous reviews.  It premiered at Sundance Film Festival, which happens to be Park City, Utah, where I live.  I haven't done press for over 20 years.  Since 1985, until about two years ago when this movie came out, I refused to do any press.  Everybody wanted the sex, the drugs, the rock and roll.  Well, you hawk like the best of them now. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, well-  You're good, sir.  You're good.  These guys came along.  This is Universal Studios and HBO.  They funded this project.  Brian Grazer of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Academy Award-winning producer, produced this film.  And two great directors, documentary directors, Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, directed this film.  And I didn't want to do it.  And they just kept hounding me.  And I said, all right, well, what's your fix on me?  How do I fit into this story that you're going to tell about social change in America? 
[01:19:30]  And they said, well, yours is a story of redemption.  I'm 16 and a half years clean and sober.  I found a program of recovery.  I turned my life around.  My life today is better than anything I could have expected it to be when I was a kid.  So, you know, I'm-  Excuse me.  Going from station to station, I'm losing my voice.  So-  Want a shot?  Hey, keep that in your- 
[01:20:00]  What are you doing?  I hear you.  God, don't use your teeth.  Early in the morning.  For Christ's sake.  A half a gallon of vodka.  What about the allegations that Linda Lovelace made that she was forced to do the movie?  Linda Lovelace was a witness for the government against me.  She wrote a book.  After she couldn't make a transition into more conventional movies and entertainment,  she joined the women's movement and wrote two books.  One called Ordeal, which says that she was forced at gunpoint to make that movie. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  To make deep-  I was the lighting director.  I wasn't even supposed to act in the damn thing.  Hilarious.  It's true.  But I had worked for the-  Hey, you.  How's your cock?  Come here.  Come here.  Hold this light and do this.  I had worked for the director as an actor many times.  I had shot Loops or these old stag films two, three years earlier with Linda Lovelace.  One or two of them are in the movie.  Really?  Yeah, they ran out of time.  62-minute movie.  You take out all the sex.  You got 11 minutes of me.  Who the hell wants to see that? 
[01:21:00]  So, Linda Lovelace wrote this book, said she was forced at gunpoint.  I, being the lighting director, was on every single scene.  No such thing happened.  Look at the movie.  She's having a ball.  So, literally and figuratively, she's enjoying herself.  So, when the women's movement dumped her, she went right back to taking off her clothes  and doing nude appearances.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  So, I turned my life around.  So, she was full of crap. 
[01:21:30]  And you're now married?  I'm happily married.  How long have you been married?  I converted to Christianity.  I was a trustee at my Methodist church.  I opened the real estate brokerage.  How do you explain your past to your wife?  Because, you know, you get into a new relationship and everyone has baggage they've got to explain  for the new girl.  She knew who I was.  Oh, she did.  We had met in 82.  And then we met again in 89.  I understand she knew who you were, but, I mean, that's got to play on her.  Like, oh my goodness.  Doesn't bother her.  Not at all.  She's an in-the-moment person.  Does she think, ah, that was just...  She doesn't care about the past.  That was just his past life that has nothing to do with us and what we're doing. 
[01:22:00]  That's exactly right.  You're like a prize, though, for people that turn their life around and find God.  Hey, I'm 58 years old.  I am baggage.  No, you know what it is?  You're good, dude.  You look like you just won the Masters.  You know what?  You really do.  You know what?  Looking good is everything.  It's not how you feel.  It's how you look.  It's perception.  So, you know, I combed my hair today.  I shaved the mustache.  I'm old.  When did you shave the mustache?  How long ago?  My wife asked me to shave it off in the first year of our marriage.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  You could have saved that in a jar and sold it on eBay if you knew eBay was going  to be invented.  Next.  Imagine having his mustache.  Amazing.  Where would you put it?  Where would I put it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'd probably put it up probably displayed on a bookcase.  Sealed, of course, because it probably smelled like trout.  You read books?  You read books?  Occasionally.  Usually comic books.  One of the smartest people you'll ever meet, Mr. James.  Is that right?  Oh, yeah.  Is that right?  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Recite the alphabet backwards. 
[01:23:00]  I tend to just pick out little things.  Not Rain Man.  He can't drop matches on the floor and he'll count them.  But he knows a thing or two about a thing or two, sir.  Yeah, he certainly does.  Well, that's something.  Turn your life around.  But you said in there during the trial you really started the drinking.  And then when did you hit bottom?  What was the thing?  Well, after the trial was over and I was convicted from 76 to 82, I didn't go near a porno movie.  And I tried to make a transition into more legitimate stuff. 
[01:23:30]  I was hired to play the coach in Greece for Alan Carr in Paramount.  And about a week before production, they paid off the contract and said, we're sorry, but we're losing play dates because you're in this movie.  And so the writing was on the wall.  I wouldn't make the transition.  So in 82, I went back very reluctantly.  I got paid a fortune.  I got paid 120 bucks for nine days work, plus 10% of the gross.  And I did another porno movie.  And from 82 to 85, I did porno movies again, but not with the same joy I used to. 
[01:24:00]  No.  You know, I was already in my mid-30s and alcohol was taking its toll.  The last movies I did, certainly I couldn't have sex, but they would carry me to a chair, put me in the chair, and I'd deliver three lines.  And a month later, a video box would come out with my picture on the cover saying another Harry Reams miracle.  Wow.  So I ended up in the ditch there in 85. 
[01:24:30]  From 85 to 89, I lived in the streets.  I panhandled.  Are you kidding me?  Most of the time in jail or a hospital or a psych lockup.  I had a doctor's appointment here in New York City.  I had eternal bleeding.  I was bleeding from the throat, my stool, my urine, everywhere.  Had two ulcers.  Hot.  Like a water pill.  I was almost dead.  So I came to New York.  I was put in the St. Luke's Roosevelt AIDS ward, interestingly enough, because it was one of the, it was the only hospital that allowed AIDS patients in, was St. Luke's Roosevelt. 
[01:25:00]  I spent 32 days.  You probably assumed you had it.  I did not.  They probably had assumed.  No, no, they didn't.  They did all the tests.  But there was a gastroenterologist, a stomach guy, who was wanting to study an alcoholic.  So for years, I went back to him to dry out.  And he kept me in for 32 days.  Friends, because I'm originally from New York, came to visit me.  And I had stolen and borrowed and, you know, pissed them all off over the years. 
[01:25:30]  And most of them said, well, I'm not going to come back.  I don't want to see you die like this.  And before they left, I used to ask for quarters for the telephone.  You got a few quarters.  I need to make phone calls.  Well, over 32 days, I had a lot of quarters.  I walked out of the hospital on 11th Avenue, walked across the street, bought a bottle of vodka, woke up seven days later in Los Angeles County Jail. 
[01:26:00]  To this day, I don't know how I got there.  That was my last drink.  That was the first day I went to a 12-step meeting.  Why the jail?  Just because you were drunk and disorderly?  Public urination, drunk and disorderly.  Wow.  I used to buy cars, huge convertible cars like Cadillacs and Pontiac Bonnevilles so that when I did, and it wasn't a question of if, it was when I smashed into a telephone pole, I would live.  And I smashed up a lot of cars going through Topanga Canyon. 
[01:26:30]  Nice drive, by the way.  So you were on 11th Avenue in New York City.  Correct.  And you end up in Los Angeles County Jail and have no clue of anything in between.  I don't remember most of 85 to 89.  When I got sober, my sponsor told me, you have to make amends.  You have to clean up your past.  You've got to call people, apologize.  You've got to show up where you need to show up.  So I had a local policeman.  By the way, I was arrested the first time I walked into a meeting. 
[01:27:00]  It was in the same building as the police department.  Wow.  So they had warrants out for me in Park City.  And I had that policeman pull up, an FBI or whatever they pull up.  And I had warrants all over the country, Florida, in South Carolina, in New York City, down on the island of Jamaica for some reason.  You had them pull this up?  Yeah.  And for that first year of sobriety, I...  So you can make amends.  Exactly.  I went to every judge.  I apologized.  I told them what I'm doing now. 
[01:27:30]  And every one of them saying, keep doing what you're doing.  You're on probation for six months.  Get out of here.  Wow.  So that was my last drink.  You want to know where the bottom was?  That was it.  That's unbelievable.  Excuse me.  It's a miracle I'm alive.  Truly.  I mean, if the voice is the worst thing that happened to me from the alcohol abuse...  I think it's kind of sexy.  I can live with that.  Thank you, sweetheart.  I do.  I like it.  A little raster.  It's kind of like Demi Moore a little bit.  Like, hey.  Kind of like it.  Wow.  Hey, Bob. 
[01:28:00]  Watch it.  Easy.  That is something.  You ought to take an example there, Bob.  I've been sober for 20 years.  I just celebrated my 20 years September 3rd.  20 years?  20 years.  I swear to God.  He wants to shake your hand there, Bob.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  I did the same thing.  We had the same joke.  What's on my hand?  We both looked at him.  Good for you.  So you know what I went through.  Yeah.  Well, not...  You know, I was a lot younger.  I was in Juvie Hall.  I didn't just wake up places.  Did you get in a program?  Yeah.  Why did you stop drinking, Bob?  I went to Juvie Hall from like... 
[01:28:30]  You know, I just got arrested again.  Was in jail again.  And again, and again, and again.  Yeah, I just kept going.  Do you like envy people that can drink and just have a good time and not...  You know what?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I wish I could be a normal drinker.  Yeah.  Just so I can get a buzz on.  Doesn't it look like fun for most people?  But I'm the kind of guy you put a bottle in front of and I pour a drink.  I'm not thinking about the rest of that bottle.  I'm thinking about where am I going to get the next bottle.  The next bottle.  Exactly right.  I never drank on the rocks. 
[01:29:00]  That's the one thing I missed.  I was young, so I was drinking beer and...  You know, we used to take the cap off of whiskey and throw it away.  Oh, you stopped drinking when you were drinking like a kid.  Well, yeah.  You didn't even get to the adult with ice and a swizzle stick.  Yeah, I was drinking in a park like a pint and just chugging it down one sip.  Nice clink, clink sound.  I never did, you know, on like three ice cubes, pour it over, let it sit.  I've never did that.  In fact, I'm going to go do it right now.  Yeah, you should.  20 years is a long time.  I'm not a drunk anymore.  Hang on. 
[01:29:30]  I'll be right back.  So after so many years, you still would like to have a drink, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  You still have the urge?  Well, I don't have the urges and the obsessions anymore.  Smoke a little weed?  For the first year.  No, nothing.  Nothing.  For the first year, you know, I had to like tie myself up, sit in my hands so that I wouldn't  go out and drink.  And I got a sponsor in that program.  And I was taught to find God in my life.  I mean, I hate to get hokey about this.  That worked out for you?  It worked out great.  God works out for me.  It worked out great.  You know, I'm happily involved with the Methodist congregation. 
[01:30:00]  That's what I'm saying.  They must hold you up like, oh, look at this.  You are their golden boy.  They're like, wow, because they like when anyone comes to the church, comes to church  out of somewhere, but usually it's a story, you know, I had a bad marriage, something  like this, when you can pull up a Harry Reams and say, look at the redemption we've done  here.  His mustache is gone and the Lord is here.  They parade you around, right?  Well, anyhow, I met a wonderful woman.  I married.  I got a real estate license, not knowing I never sold a thing in my life. 
[01:30:30]  And you're successful with the real estate business?  Hugely.  Really?  Yeah.  There's about 600 realtors in my community.  I'm always in the top 10.  Yeah?  Top five.  Nice.  Wow.  That's a great story.  See, I didn't know.  I'm glad I didn't read a bio.  That's a great story.  You changed, but you changed.  It sounds like you changed the way you talk and the, like the set, you're kind of like.  I got one for you guys.  You ought to take this.  You ought to practice this.  You ready?  I used a lot of profanity when I was younger.  I certainly used a lot of it when I was drunk. 
[01:31:00]  So my first sponsor said to me, go buy a roll of quarters.  Put it in your right pocket.  Every time you use a profanity, put a quarter in your left pocket.  And then when you go to a meeting tonight, dump the whole thing into the kitty.  Well, in three days, I wasn't using profanity.  I was out about 60 bucks.  Yeah.  What the fuck are you talking about?  But I've never used profanity anymore.  But you've still got a roll of quarters in your pocket.  At least I think. 
[01:31:30]  It's looking like dimes today.  But you can't, you can't, you can't.  You don't like swearing.  You don't like swearing.  You can tell it.  The way he's talking.  He's a religious man now.  Yeah.  No, I'm not religious.  I'm not religious.  I enjoy a curse.  You know what I do on Sunday now?  Huh?  Play golf?  Yeah, I go to the Church of the 18 Lynx.  There you go.  I play golf and I say a prayer.  Do you still enjoy the, uh, the, uh, sex?  What?  Do you still enjoy sex?  I'm not going there.  No, he's not going there.  You know, when you think you hear Harry Reams saying something like, I put it in the hole, 
[01:32:00]  you would never think he's talking about his Sunday golf game.  Of this day and age, it's a lot different than the seven days and age.  He said it nice, though.  He didn't say, you know, you said it nice.  No, that's all.  That's all I'm saying.  Because that is an interesting fact that you did change your life around.  Well, you did, too.  Like, you know, like, I'm, uh, well, I did, but I'm still a sexual creep.  I need to work on that.  You know what I mean?  He said you work on it.  Yeah, but, I mean, you know what?  Well, you're talking to a guy that...  20 years, it'll be all over for you.  Oh, yeah?  20 years? 
[01:32:30]  Harry said...  I'm 58.  I haven't thought about sex.  No Viagra, Cialis.  Harry, out of respect for you, I'll say it this way.  Uh, the man you're looking at right now?  Yeah.  He used to get off by effing sinks.  Well, he would lay on the sink in the hotel room.  I can make you a star.  Really?  Yeah, you want to make a movie?  Sink fucker.  You put a mustache on me?  I can make a movie.  I can make a movie.  Yeah, so, uh, wow.  Have you ever heard of that?  No.  Exactly.  No.  You never banged a sink?  What's a sink?  A sink.  You mean, like, where you shave? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  You put your hand on the edge of...  You know, the long sinks in the hotel, and they have the sink in the middle?  He's serious.  And you put your hand on the edge of the sink.  You kind of lie on top of it like this, and you put your hand on the edge like that.  Hey, get that away from me.  I really did look like I was just going to blow him, didn't I?  You really did.  You were leaning over a little too much.  Disgusting, man.  And he flinched, too.  It's a way of getting himself off with his hand.  Well, you know, looking at him, I understand.  Jeez.  You're going to throw him on me now. 
[01:33:30]  We've been having a nice conversation.  Any addictions?  It's time to beat up somebody else.  Any addictions you still have?  Coffee, cigarettes, anything?  Yeah, coffee and cigarettes.  Coffee and cigarettes.  I should have quit cigarettes at the same time I quit booze.  Yeah.  And I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes incessantly.  You've got to have something, though.  You've got to have something, Harry.  Seems like you had a problem with being an addictive personality for years.  Well, you know what?  I've taken that compulsive, addictive behavior, because you can't change that.  And I've just channeled it into more constructive stuff.  You wake up at 3 in the morning, I've got to sell a house. 
[01:34:00]  I've got to sell a house.  Shut up, bitch.  I have to sell.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Happily married.  Wow, look at that.  That was a character I was doing.  Look out the door.  Oh, there are some very attractive girls out there.  Oh, my goodness.  You want to meet the girls real fast?  They're here to hand out wow stickers.  I don't want to meet any girl real fast.  I want it to last.  They're doing a little promotion for us.  As we get these girls in here, what do you think of the porn business today?  You pay attention to it at all?  Instead of being a million-dollar business, it's a billion-dollar business.  And the reason is hotels all around the nation buy these things and put them on the air for $12 a pop. 
[01:34:30]  Yep.  And that's what's turned it into a billion-dollar, more than a billion dollars.  Never saw that coming in the porn industry years ago.  No.  That it would be so accepted.  There were no VCRs.  There was no Betamax.  There was no nothing.  You had to go to the local.  You went to a seedy little theater.  Theater, yeah.  And you sat next to a stranger and got his raincoat wet.  Put your arm around him.  Hey.  Oh, my goodness.  But what do you think of the porns getting freakier and freakier, though? 
[01:35:00]  They're all trying.  I don't know.  I haven't seen it.  You haven't seen any?  I haven't seen a porn movie in 30 years.  There's a series out called Slap Happy.  And it's a lot of, actually, violence in it.  It's girls doing oral to the gentleman, but the guy is holding the camera as she's doing it.  And he's, like, smacks her.  The guy's holding the camera?  Yeah, he's the one doing the camera work.  And so you get that overhead shot, and then he smacks her in the face and pulls it out and smacks her with it.  And it's a little too violent. 
[01:35:30]  I don't like the violence thing.  I'll watch the sex.  I enjoy that.  Make him choke on it now.  I just don't like a lot of this.  Make her gag.  You know.  Let that thing away.  And then they got the Baker's Dozen.  You know, it's Bukkake in the face.  I don't know anything about this.  And my favorite porn I'm holding right now, Century Sex, sir.  Oh, have you seen this?  No, no.  Talking to porn legend Harry Reams, by the way.  Look at that woman.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What is Century Sex?  Looks like my mother.  Look at the cover.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  Look at the cover there.  It could have been someone you did back in the day still doing porno. 
[01:36:00]  Maybe.  You never know.  Maybe.  You know, my thoughts on what I did 40 years ago is I hope I had a good time.  I hate to feel that bad and not have had a good time.  If you're on the program, don't they tell you not to really hang out with people you used  to know back then?  Yeah.  You stay away from the people, the places, and the things that are going to get you in  trouble.  Do you know or have you spoken with anyone from back in those days?  No.  Well, yeah.  This is one actor, Jamie Gillis.  He and I are friends.  Excuse me. 
[01:36:30]  What about Ron Jeremy?  No.  Yeah, I know Ron, but I haven't talked to him in 30 years.  He's more a caricature of a porn star now.  But Jamie used to teach in the New York School District, and I worked for ... I studied  with Lee Strasberg, so we were educated guys, and we had somebody to talk to.  You studied with Lee Strasberg?  Yeah.  Get out of town.  Swear to God.  Yeah.  I studied right across the street here.  He's a real actor.  No shit.  He's the real deal.  I used to be.  That's right.  Steve, you got a question for Harry Reams?  No.  You almost covered it.  You mentioned ... You asked him what he thought about the current stuff. 
[01:37:00]  Guys like Brandon, who are making the pseudo-Bukkake movies, and they're making lots of money.  They are making a lot of money.  When I worked, it was 100 bucks a day.  100 bucks a day.  Yeah.  Of course, after Deep Throat, it was thousands a day.  Well, the performers really don't make that much money comparatively.  I hear differently.  The women do.  Women make great money.  The guys make nothing.  The guys who are distributing it, like you said, in the hotels, those guys are making millions  upon millions of dollars.  Well, the owners of the film.  Yeah.  The guys that are actually just getting paid. 
[01:37:30]  Chicks want to do DP.  You know?  Yeah.  They're making some cake.  Yeah.  Guys don't make nothing.  I like the ... I need a plot, man.  I like the old school.  I can't get into ... The girl walks in, hey, how's it going?  You know, call ...  They both have their place.  Sometimes you like a nice, goofy plot.  Other times, you just want to turn it on and get the business done with the get out.  I love a plot.  I love a plot.  You do?  I do.  In a porno movie?  That's not entertainment.  In a porno movie.  Yeah, it is.  I need porno movies.  Because I need to go there.  Porno movies ...  It has to feel real.  ... always were and will always be a sex aid. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  It's titillation.  It's voyeurism.  Nobody cares about the storyline.  You're a mess.  It's not ... Listen to me.  I'm a ball guy.  I just told you I fucked a sink.  I am a mess.  I mean, we've established that.  Harry dreams of calling you a mess.  This guy doesn't remember four years of his life and he's calling you a mess.  Three more years of sobriety than you, and I like to fucking sinks.  Yes, I'm a mess.  But I'm saying that you need that.  I need that story because ...  For what?  I'm going to tell you, Harry. 
[01:38:30]  He wants to care about the ...  No, I don't want to care about these girls.  Because he needs to cry while he's whacking off.  No, I need midgets.  No, because I like the storyline because it's like almost watching a regular TV show, and  then all of a sudden the chick's sucking his conch.  So, a film like Deep Throat, you like, because it had acting.  No, not acting.  Let's not get carried away, Harry.  I know you went to Lee, but ...  You take the sex out of Deep Throat, and you're left with 11 minutes of me.  Yeah, we got it. 
[01:39:00]  Who the hell wants to see 11 minutes of me?  I like it, Harry.  We have some audio, I believe, of you from Deep Throat.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Let me hear a little of that.  Well, let's take a listen here.  Well, it's really quite common.  Perhaps you've had a traumatic ...  Is that you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you make a choice for the accent?  Anyhow, yeah.  I'm trying to figure out why she can't have an orgasm.  Right.  So, I'm looking all over, and I look down her throat, and I go, there you are, you little  bugger.  Can we reenact the scene right now?  I'll be real.  Her clitoris is deep down in the bottom of her throat. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, her clit was in her throat.  And she starts crying.  She starts crying and says, well, suppose your balls were in your ears.  And I said, well, then I could hear myself coming.  We've got to listen to this.  It's audio from Deep Throat with Harry Reams.  Well, it's really quite common.  Perhaps you've had a traumatic experience as a child.  No, I don't think so.  Nothing unpleasant that could have possibly turned you off to sex when you were younger?  You're getting me all wet. 
[01:40:00]  Please, doctor.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Nurse!  Nurse, Miss Lovelace is done with her bubbles.  Ah, the music.  Nothing turns you off to sex.  Listen, doctor, please.  Please, I'm not turned off to sex.  I enjoy it.  In fact, I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.  Well, then what's the problem?  I don't know.  Something's missing.  Something's missing?  Yes.  Something's missing.  There should be more to it than a lot of little tingles. 
[01:40:30]  Tingles?  I want to hear bells.  Bells?  Bombs.  Bombs?  And dams bursting.  Rockets red glare.  Bombs bursting in air.  Gave truth to the night that our flag was still there.  Please be serious.  Nurse!  Nurse!  Take that away.  Nurse, what problem?  You say that you want more out of sex than just a lot of little tingles.  Yes, I want to hear bells.  Embark.  Yes, we just went through that, Miss Lovelace.  Let's not do that one again. 
[01:41:00]  You know, I think your problem might be physical instead of psychological.  Have you ever had an internal examination?  No, I don't think so.  Step into my examination room.  I want to take a look at you.  Please stop this.  Wow.  Harry Raves, everyone.  Wow.  It's not the same without the picture.  It's not the same without the image.  You blew her away, her acting.  No, she blew me away.  Oh, doctor. 
[01:41:30]  You were putting on sort of an accent.  Oh, rather.  Watson?  Listen, I want people to go out and buy this DVD.  It's getting great reviews.  It's been at every film festival since last February.  Wonderful acclaim.  It's done by professionals.  And it's really not about Deep Throat, but it is.  It tells the history of it, how the porno industry started and where it's at today.  But it really looks at America.  America, you know, it's the thread to tie together social change from the 60s to today. 
[01:42:00]  And it's very fascinating.  It's very informative.  Well, I will definitely pick it up and check it out.  You want to meet the ladies really fast behind you?  I know you only have a couple of minutes left here, but.  What have we got here?  Wait, that mic's not on.  It's not.  What do you got under there?  Son of a.  You want to bring them over here?  What do you got under there?  They're not on.  The mic's not on.  Come on, let me see.  Come on.  I want to see you up here.  What do you want to see here?  Here you go.  Wow.  Oh, boy. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, boy.  Somebody's from Blackheart.  Harry.  Do you guys know who Harry Reams is?  I don't know.  No.  Legendary porn star.  You ever see Deep Throat?  No.  The movie Deep Throat?  He's in it.  You ever hear of it?  There's nobody here over 12 years old.  What are you talking about?  Huh?  Too busy at home trying it.  Yeah.  God bless her.  God bless her and her tulip.  If Harry stays to the rest of the show, we'll mess him all up.  Oh, yeah.  He'll be drinking.  Drinking and having sex on the console. 
[01:43:00]  He's doing the scene.  You'll hear, oh, doctor.  He's doing great, but I can tell he's barely old enough.  Yeah.  And he's old enough.  By his fingernails.  By his fingernails.  I got to work off you guys.  Come on.  This ain't easy.  Harry, keep it together.  You got a four-bedroom that's going to sell on Tuesday.  Yeah.  Terrific.  That's right.  Terrific.  You'll be in one of them, won't you, Bob?  Yeah, I will if you get a couple of these girls.  I'll throw in a sink.  Ladies, any questions?  I'll throw in a sink for you by this house.  Ladies, any questions for Harry Reams, porn legend?  Yeah.  You must have a question about porn, maybe.  How big is your dick? 
[01:43:30]  Oh.  That's a good question.  You mean then or now?  Yeah.  He was packing pretty good in the day.  Was he packing?  In the day.  In the 70s, yeah.  In the day.  Uh-huh.  Did it shrink?  Yeah, like everything else on my body.  I have no muscles anymore.  I have no thing.  I have nothing.  Oh, that's sad.  He's got a real estate business.  He's an old guy going brain dead.  You got a great hairline.  I'll give you that.  There you go.  Your hair is unbelievable.  Good for you.  What are you doing?  If you were a woman, I'd marry you. 
[01:44:00]  Well, what are you going to do?  You know, I live in Utah.  Polygamy.  Really?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  No, don't throw anything on him.  I'm sorry.  I'm using the Lord's name.  Yeah, but he's talking about having sex with me, and I say Jesus Christ, and I'm the bad guy?  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  I'm sorry.  You're using the Lord's name in vain.  That's right.  I thought I was a guest.  Yes.  I feel like a prisoner.  How do I get out of this mess?  Any other questions for Harry Reams, porn legend?  Package.  How many chicks did you bang?  All right.  How many girls?  Harry.  That was a good question. 
[01:44:30]  I think I'm into four figures.  One, two, three.  Wow, really?  Probably.  I had to figure that out in my head.  And that was just 1974.  Yeah.  Wow.  No joke there?  I got nothing to say.  Over 1,000, you think?  I don't know.  Well, look at his IMDb.  It has to be.  Look at IMDb.  We're looking at 137 films on there.  Oh, for me?  Yeah, forced entry.  You know that's wrong, and I'll tell you why.  A lot of clips.  Some of them say 1989, 1988. 
[01:45:00]  I see that.  Why are you in Come Shot Review 5 in 89?  Yeah, I know.  That's what I mean.  I stopped doing these things in 85.  They just changed the titles, put them in a new box with a new cover, and resell the  same movie.  So you're saying you're not in Oral Majority 2?  No?  Not that I recall.  How about Backdoor Brides?  I don't think so.  No?  No.  When was the last time, besides being married and stuff, when was the last time you saw  Strange Girls Strange?  A Bush? 
[01:45:30]  A while ago?  A long time.  A long time ago.  A long, long time.  That's pretty good.  You've been married over 16 years.  Wow.  Married over 15 years.  Any other ladies want to flash Harry your snatch?  You know, regardless of how beautiful they are, and they all are, I still love my wife.  Of course.  There's no interest here.  But it's always nice to see.  Hey, you love your wife.  God bless America.  Show me pussy.  She did that already.  Again?  Somebody else's.  What else she got?  Any other. 
[01:46:00]  The way you did, it was kind of like you were...  How about the top end for Harry?  So what's go...  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  No, no, no, no.  The top.  The top.  The top.  The top.  The top.  The top.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we're talking.  We're working as a team now, Harry.  Come on.  Burrow star.  The hell with you, Bob?  We're really messing this guy up.  He's going to fall apart after this.  Get Harry some Jägermeister.  I thought...  I'll tell you what's good in coffee.  Where's the Jägermeister machine?  A little Bailey's in the coffee is good. 
[01:46:30]  And that's not even like drinking, Harry.  Of course not.  Ah, a little bit.  It's a coffee drink.  That doesn't count.  I got your back, Harry.  I won't let anything happen to you.  All right.  So how much longer am I going to have to hold you guys up here?  All right.  No.  We're going to let you go.  Harry, thank you, man, for coming in.  You're a pleasure.  It's Harry Reams.  Harry Reams, thank you, man.  You betcha.  Thank you, guys.  Now get out.  See you.  Have fun.  All right.  Enjoy.  You too, sir.  Take the headphones off.  Watch them headphones.  I thought I could take those home.  Take it easy, Harry.  Take them out. 
[01:47:00]  See you, ladies.  Dressed on nice.  He's got a great headache, great hair on his head like that.  He looks like he just won the Masters.  He does.  It looks like he just won the Masters.  Yeah.  He's one drink away from sounding like Tippi Tom.  So, as all people are saying.  Oh, they are saying that?  There's Tippi Tom in there.  He sounds like a cleaned up Tippi Tom.  He said he also sounds like Chris Penn.  Oh, yeah.  That was Chris Penn action.  Chris Penn in his voice.  Sure.  But, man, pulled himself together after.  That's probably why he's still alive.  A lot of the porn guys from back then.  Gone. 
[01:47:30]  Gone.  Where's the promos about us celebrating the female?  Nice, young, fresh vagina.  Fresh vagina.  Fresh vagina.  Fresh vagina.  You're the Ian Anthony Show.  Yes, you did a good job on that promo.  Promo.

I like my penis.  And then the home invasion thing, too.  Yeah, this has just got me now in a tizzy.  We've got to explain this for the rest of the country.  Uh-huh.  Patrice goes to Hawaii, people.  Escape from reality.  There you go.  We've got to explain this for the rest of the country.  He's making fun of me.  But I think the rest of the country can kind of understand this. 
[01:51:30]  A lot of people move away from the cities to the suburbs because they feel like they're safer.  Yeah, you move to a place that you think is a safe place.  I moved to the north shore of Nassau County.  Now, this is an area that is pretty wealthy, Jewish, a lot of Jews in the area, a lot of rich Indians that are doctors.  You know, they live up there.  The book, The Great Gatsby.  The Great Gatsby.  Yeah, it was set up there. 
[01:52:00]  A lot of these things.  Teddy Roosevelt's house, you know, north shore, Long Island.  Very nice area to live in.  So I figure, hey, I'm going to finally move on up like George Jefferson.  I'm moving on up.  I'm going to live there and not have to worry so much.  I lived in Brooklyn for a while and not, you know, I didn't live in Flatbush or nothing.  I lived in Bay Ridge.  Nothing ever happened to you, did it?  No, it did.  It was just because it's fucking Brooklyn. 
[01:52:30]  My car was getting keyed.  Come out one day and my girlfriend's Jeep had, you know, the window smashed out and the spare tires gone.  Property damage.  Yeah, and very minor theft.  But look what's happening in Long Island.  This is the thing.  And it's because there's only one or two cops because there's no need to have a police force.  Exactly.  And now the guy, the executive of Nassau County is in all kinds of deep shit because he wants to cut the cops even more during this time when now we need a shitload of cops.  I want cops everywhere. 
[01:53:00]  I want Nassau County cops.  And when you drive through Nassau County, you really don't see that many Nassau County cops.  You see some Nassau County highway patrol cops, like the guys out on the expressway and parkways and shit, waiting there to pull you over to give you a ticket for speeding.  But I want them cruising through those neighborhoods.  I want them peeking around, looking.  Because there's no crime there.  They don't have the patrol.  But there is crime now.  Now it is.  That's the smart thing to do.  And that's not a moneymaker to be cruising up and down the street.  No, no.  That's not making the revenue.  It's out on the highway. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, you got to hide in a bush.  That's how you make the money.  Well, apparently now it's easy pickings.  That's what Nassau County is now.  They found it.  It's easy pickings.  Well, this has been going on for about a week to 10 days, right?  No, this is the past year they've had unprecedented numbers of home invasion, robberies.  And home invasion, let me tell you, that's, again, with my law understanding, home invasion is high.  It's right under murder.  It really is a violent, nasty thing. 
[01:54:00]  And home invasion, coming into somebody's house when they're home turns it into something where they might as well kill you.  Yeah, yeah.  Why leave you alive if they're going to invade your home while you leave you home?  It's just a horrifying thing to think to have happen.  Now, a lot of these people, a majority of the break-ins, if not all of them, are through some type of open door.  These stupid motherfuckers in Nassau County have been living like they think that they could sleep with their door unlocked, that that's their safety. 
[01:54:30]  Look, I can do this.  I don't have to lock my door.  So it makes me feel like I live in a safe place.  Lock your doors, assholes.  Batten down the hatches, I say.  But why would you do that?  Like, you know, you move.  What's the point of moving from Brooklyn to go live the same way in Nassau?  You know what I'm saying?  I know.  Like, you went to leave to be safe and feel what it feels like to sleep with your doors open, hear crickets.  Yeah.  You know.  Because people like that. 
[01:55:00]  It's either doors or windows.  What people like doing in the suburbs is sleeping without the air conditioner on.  You open up that window and you hear, yeah, the birds or the crickets.  You feel like, ooh, that was a nice breeze.  You're smelling outside.  That's what you want.  That's why you moved there.  And now a member of the Latin Kings or the what?  M18 or whatever they're called?  Or my most horrifying one yet.  They are identifying the gangs.  There's three gangs that are doing the home invasions.  Is it M18, I think? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, there's gangs that are doing the home invasions.  Oh, yeah.  Three of them.  There's gangs.  The Latin Kings, which are huge out in, like, Brentwood in Suffolk County, Long Island, out in that area.  They're blowing up out there.  They're huge.  Are they tying up the people?  Yeah.  They tie them up with the phone cords.  They rip the phone cords out.  They tie them up.  Who has phone cords?  I know.  You're cordless.  You better have a phone cord.  Those motherfuckers.  I'd be like, oh, I don't have phone cords.  They're going to kill me.  They can't tie me up.  They rip it out.  Are you going to install an old-fashioned phone?  I'm going to have an old-fashioned ring with a phone cord. 
[01:56:00]  One of those old, big, heavy, black bell telephones.  And they tie you up, blindfold you.  There are kids in a lot of these cases.  And they take the kids, and they make them lay down on the floor and put pillows over their heads and tell them to stay there.  Oh, good God.  And then they ransack the place.  They get the jewelry, computer equipment, and load it into a waiting car.  And then they drive off and leave the people there horrified.  Well, at least they're not killing them.  Yet.  Yet.  Oops.  So the last case, they go in. 
[01:56:30]  This woman comes out of her bedroom, and they kind of rough her up a little, send her back.  Then the husband comes out.  He's wearing an NYPD shirt, but he's not a cop.  So they go bullshit on this guy.  Where's the motherfucking gun?  Where's the fucking gun, motherfucker?  Oh, so they thought he was a cop.  Yeah, they thought he was a cop because he's got the NYPD shirt on.  And he's just like, I'm a tourist or whatever.  They're for sale everywhere, pal.  Why did they ever agree to sell NYPD?  I know. 
[01:57:00]  Shirts and hats and stuff.  Unless you're a cop, don't wear that shit.  I've been in situations where I'm a little scared, but then you see a guy in one of those shirts or a hat, and you're like, oh, all right.  Great.  And then you realize that.  Works at the deli.  You realize half these guys are just out-of-towners that just bought the damn thing.  They bought it before they go back to Iowa.  It was right under the fucking I Love New York shirt in his drawer, and he pulled that one out.  I feel a little fear, but then I see a guy with an FBI shirt on, and I'm like, oh, all right.  Yeah.  He'll know what to do.  He's got it under control.  He's just some plumber from fucking Indiana. 
[01:57:30]  You look, Anthony kind of looks like he's, like, he lives in a rich, in a decent neighborhood, evidently.  Yeah.  You look like a mob union representative.  You know, like, you look like somebody, like, don't, let's not get into any problems.  Like there should be some trouble or something.  Yeah, you just look like trouble, man.  You do.  The Sicilian in me.  You do look like trouble.  But you like the city, though, right?  Yeah, I really do.  Opie likes the city.  Eventually, I'll move back out to the suburbs, get a house and stuff.  But white people moving back in to the city.  Yeah, I really do enjoy the city now, finally. 
[01:58:00]  You know, I don't like the homeless guy, you know, showering outside my window every night.  But besides that, yeah, it's good.  Oh, that was it.  The third gang.  The fat guys.  The fat guys.  The fat guys out of Manhattan are breaking in now.  And I blame TV.  Once again, I blame the news.  You made a great point in the office.  Because just before we went on the air, there's a new home invasion.  Not the one you're going to read about in the paper today.  A new one that they just discovered.  They had a live shot from Long Island, Newcastle.  And they showed a bicycle in a driveway from like a helicopter shot and said an attempted home invasion here. 
[01:58:30]  And the guy just, I guess, they thwarted it, the homeowners.  And he left his bike and ran.  Took off on foot.  But, you know, another attempt.  And I think it's these copycats is what's happening.  They make it look easy.  Yeah, the news is showing you, wow, look how easy this is.  It's easy picking, so now these gangs go, all right, let's get a couple of guys together.  We'll go out.  We'll break in.  And, you know, take money. 
[01:59:00]  There's money for the taking at these places.  That's the fat guys, right?  The fat guys out of Manhattan.  Nice.  I'm a little scared of them.  The Latin Kings, M-18.  And now, you know, I was reading the paper.  Locks at Home Depot.  They showed this woman buying a big lock.  Look at this woman.  Look at her.  Look at her.  That's going to protect you from the fat guys.  Here's what you got to do.  What a bunch of dummies.  People are lining up at the Home Depots to get the real expensive locks.  The locks.  Yeah, that's going to stop people. 
[01:59:30]  Here's what you got to do, people of Nassau County.  Guns!  Guns.  Today, when I leave this station, I am going right to the gun store and getting myself a shotgun.  All of a sudden, the rapier.  You're going to sleep with it?  I'm not feeling it.  It's going to be right there next to my bed.  Really?  Right there.  And you've had, like, some training in picking up guns and just...  Oh, I'm really good with guns.  Oh, my God.  I mean, and not in terms of shooting, but in terms of, like, you know, hearing noise and... 
[02:00:00]  No, I'm not, like, crazy.  Quick draw.  No, not quick draw.  Like, when the Puerto Rican comes in with the pistol to your head, it's like, that gun is now his property.  He robbed a cop, which he thought he was a cop.  So, don't do it.  No, no.  Don't get a gun and get killed.  Listen, Patrice.  I sleep.  He's just upgrading, because right now he's protecting himself with a rapier.  I have a rapier, which is a sword.  That is my...  Look at his face.  Look at his face.  That is my home defense right now. 
[02:00:30]  I can't believe what a white guy you are.  I have a sword.  He has a rapier.  Oh, God.  With a protection for his knuckles.  The M18 and the MS-13.  Yeah.  Relatively new to New York.  There has formed refugees from Salvadorian Civil War.  They began arriving 20 years ago.  Other games like Vatos Locos, Trevisos, and Vagos are even newer.  Born as recently arrived, Mexicans responded to harassment from older gangs, such as the 
[02:01:00]  Bloods, Latin Kings, and Nietas.  With time, the immigrant street corner crews have grown larger, more numerous, and more  violent.  Where are they at?  They're out on Long Island.  They're everywhere.  Dude, they're out on Long Island, these guys.  The Latin Kings are huge out on Long Island.  But they can't just hang.  Look at this.  Here it is.  Home invasion.  Oh, look at home.  What am I going to do?  They must have to stake you out or something.  They can't.  Because just a mild-mannered Mexican walking around without being escorted somewhere is 
[02:01:30]  a suspect.  It's like there's a Mexican in my area.  So they're going to call the cops anyway without that.  Here's their M.O.  They drive around.  They drive around these nice neighborhoods that are relatively close to the expressway or  the parkway.  And they cruise around slow at 3 in the morning.  And when they see a likely yard, something maybe that isn't seen from the street, not  well lit, something like that, they'll check the doors. 
[02:02:00]  They'll check the garage.  They'll try to get in through an opening like that.  If they can't, they'll move on.  Try to find another one.  If they can, you're fucked.  They're coming in your fucking house.  I sleep with my...  See, now you two said he's getting the shotgun and everything.  When I sleep, the bedroom door has a lock on it.  That motherfucker's locked.  You got a panic room?  I have the panic room bedroom.  So if someone breaks into the house, they're going to then have to break into my bedroom.  I'll hear something outside.  That's when I pick up and level the shotgun. 
[02:02:30]  Through your wooden doors?  Through my wooden doors.  Through your wooden panic room door.  Fucking Jodie Foster over there.  There is yet to be a home invasion where they have hacked through my doors.  Four locks and an iron door.  Is that what you got?  Absolutely.  That's why I always live in apartments, man.  I don't like creepy houses.  I don't like...  When I drive through Connecticut, it scares me more...  See, I don't like the apartments.  ...than the worst part of Brooklyn.  There's nothing worse than that creaky echo sound of the stairwell fucking iron door 
[02:03:00]  that just waiting to be robbed or raped in an apartment building.  Oh, the elevator don't work.  But look...  Wait a minute, though.  Hey, motherfucker.  Oh, no.  But now you're more scared than when you lived in Brooklyn.  You're right.  Because of the illusion of safety. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  At least like an iron door...  Put it this way.  You're safe in your house when you have an iron door and all the creaking stairs and the whatever else.  You're true.  I mean, you know what I mean?  I believe it.  And there's always somebody around in New York.  Always somebody around.  Somewhere.  A lot of people are calling in saying, buy a gun and fire away.  Shotgun.  This is just...  I am purchasing the Mossberg.  This is what white people do for free.  I'm getting...  Exactly.  This is just a setup to be able to murder young...  No.  Young scared. 
[02:04:00]  Do you read this thing?  They were afraid of other gangs.  Right.  And had to leave.  And this is just protection for them.  And they need a little revenue.  You know what, though?  This is what will happen.  If some guy breaks in or a gang breaks in, one guy gets killed in someone's living room,  you know, a homeowner with a shotgun, boom, he's dead, that'll cut back on this.  Because then it'll be like, all right, it was easy pickings.  They're starting to fight back.  That's right.  Let's move somewhere else.  We're going to have to take one out, Patrice.  I'm sorry.  This is... 
[02:04:30]  One's got to go.  We're going to have to take one out.  One has got to go.  This is more non-understanding of violence by the white man.  We're going to have to take one out.  It's got to escalate.  As violent as you people are, you just don't understand that all this is going to do...  We're violent.  That's what I'm saying.  Let me tell you.  These kids are not afraid of some white dude who goes buy a pistol.  The M-18 doesn't like freedom.  We got to fight him.  It's MS-13.  MS-13.  No, and M-18.  Oh, okay.  There's two.  A bunch of people are screaming on the phones. 
[02:05:00]  It's MS-13.  I'm looking here.  Gangs like M-18 and MS-13.  It is the MS-13.  They call it.  We're the MS-13s, fool.  Fool-ass, mark-ass nigga.  I'm sure there's some curled-up fingers right now trying to represent that.  Hey, ho.  Hey, ho.  Hey, vato.  Vato.  Wearing those flannels with only the top button buttoned.  The collar.  Who's this Anthony Vato?  Hey.  Two-one.  Two-one.  Two-one.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Connecticut.  Jeff? 
[02:05:30]  Guys, good morning.  How are you?  Good morning.  We're having a good time with Patrice O'Neal.  Excellent.  Hey, listen.  You know, the one thing that nobody ever realizes is that when you dial 911, the police are never  obligated to protect you as an individual.  They're obligated to protect society as a whole.  So buy a gun, stock up, and when you drop one, you're exactly right.  The crime is going to drop.  Look at places like Vermont, and what's the crime where they can carry guns anywhere?  Zero.  Nothing.  So go for it.  There you go.  I don't agree with that. 
[02:06:00]  There you go.  People say if you shoot one of these guys, then the whole gang comes back for you.  I just don't.  It's just.  Time and time again, it's proven that crime drops with an increase in gun ownership.  That's true.  People are afraid.  Documented.  That's true.  It's just more conspiracy to kill the black and poor people.  Is that it?  It just is.  Well, why aren't they self-respecting white guys, Robin?  It's so quick just to shoot somebody, man.  I live around murderers and stuff.  If you just mind your business, we can't have them coming in our homes, Patrice. 
[02:06:30]  Just one home.  This is what's killing me.  How many homes got invaded?  I think 25.  25, really?  Yeah.  That's a lot.  That is a lot.  I was going to say four or five.  No.  It's 25, man.  And they're just operating.  Never mind.  Shoot these Mexicans.  They're all in my area.  Yeah.  Just stay.  I don't like that.  Just stay out of our neighborhoods.  Stay out of my goddamn neighborhood.  We're staying out of your neighborhood.  No, you're not.  You go there to buy some drugs.  Hell no.  Or pretend you're an undercover cop. 
[02:07:00]  It's nothing.  You're safe in our neighborhood.  That's where you should move where black people are.  Nothing will happen to you.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Black people just don't bother white people.  You know what, though?  I wouldn't be able to drive anywhere.  The second I hop in my car and drive, I'd be pulled over.  What are you doing here?  What are you doing in this neighborhood?  I love watching cops.  I love when the white guys are driving in a little Toyota or something, and the cops pull  them over.  Where were you coming from?  Oh, a friend.  I have a friend.  You've got no friend over here.  What were you doing?  What were you doing? 
[02:07:30]  No, I was dropping off something.  They never have the story because they were buying drugs, and they always get it out of  them, too, the cops.  You were buying drugs.  I was like, well, yeah, you're going to get yourself killed.  Stay out of this neighborhood.  Always some dopey white guy trying to buy dope from the black guys.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I'm going to get killed.  That's an ongoing story.  I'm trading in my rapier.  I'm upgrading.  It's almost like one of my favorite games, Age of Empires, Opie, where now I've reached 
[02:08:00]  a level where I have to now upgrade my forces, and I'm upgrading to the firearm age.  Nice.  I'm trading in the swords and the cavalrymen for some musketeers.  I'm going to feel bad for you when you have to deal with the guilt of actually killing  a human being, man.  You know something?  There would be no guilt whatsoever.  You don't think so?  If some motherfucker broke into my house, if I killed someone accidentally driving, something  like that, it would be the most guilt. 
[02:08:30]  The rest of my life would be guilt ridden.  Some motherfucker breaks into my house, I would hope to get him in the kneecaps.  So I could just fuck with him a little bit.  So I could just...  I would hire people to play out the Pulp Fiction scene with the fucking rapist guy in the basement  on the guy just out of pleasure that this motherfucker was trying, probably laughing with his buddies  with the last one that he got away with.  Like, all that shit plays out in my head.  Hey, yeah, Anthony.  That he's laughing. 
[02:09:00]  You have dreams of being, like, a vigilante.  Oh, I would love it.  Oh, yeah.  He's just waiting for the day to kill somebody.  Zed's dead.  That's right.  Zed's dead.  And say a catchphrase like, you broke into the wrong L.I.  crib.  Right.  Yeah, we need to come up with Anthony's catchphrase today.  Anthony's catchphrase.  What's my catchphrase when I shoot this motherfucker?  That's your job today as a listener of this program.  Anthony's catchphrase.  I shot him, and he went, oh, eh? 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah, baby.  I got some stats here.  In Suffolk County, there have been 17 home invasions this year.  Nassau has had at least 29 cases since December.  29.  Since December.  Great.  We're working on 30.  That's a lot.  That is, that is, why is that not news?  It is news.  They're just starting now, and it's because no one's done anything.  The police presence hasn't been stepped up. 
[02:10:00]  The people are like, it's like sheep.  They're like sheep.  This one woman, remember they just found that dead body of that girl?  Oh, yeah.  That woman.  In Sands Point?  In Sands Point, which is like hoity-toity exclusive area.  That is the Great Gatsby.  That is the Great Gatsby house is right up there.  They find her dead, and they're talking to the homeowners, and she goes, I can't believe  this happened here.  This is such a nice neighborhood.  We all, during the day, our doors are unlocked.  Yeah, fucking advertise, asshole.  Get on the news and tell people your doors are unlocked every day. 
[02:10:30]  They're unlocked in Canada, evidently, you know?  Yeah, evidently.  I saw that with Michael Moore walked around and was able to open people's houses.  We're going to get into the Michael Moore thing after the break, because that's a whole  another half hour, man.  The infantry's on the same page with Pat.  Biscuit Eater.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, you need to not worry about those Mossbergs.  You need a Remington 1100.  Really?  Remington 1100?  Why?  That's an automatic.  You don't want to be sitting there trying to pump off shots.  You need an automatic, you know? 
[02:11:00]  I can't be jamming, though.  I can't have any fucking automatic shotgun jams.  I take out a kneecap.  I don't want a fucking shell lodged in there.  Nah, it's a Cadillac, man.  Go with the Remington 1100.  It's a Cadillac of shotguns.  You know, I'll tell you, one of your calls are going to call and tell you the perfect  gun for killing a Mexican.  You know what?  The Beaner 4000?  That'll knock his head.  I need the punisher.  He picked the perfect day to be here.  Oh, yeah.  Because if it was Bill Burr, it'd be just a bunch of white guys talking like this is normal 
[02:11:30]  shit.  But you're going to show us the other side of it.  Trees has the other side of it.  Why are you getting a shotgun?  Just let him come in and take some shit.  Tie you up with a phone cord.  Because they're kind of short, right?  Sometimes you miss.  If you get big holes in your gun, it'll miss those little sons of bitches.  So you got to get them little holes.  Mexicans is short.  What you need.  See, they got an extra juggler vein in their shoulder nobody know about.  We cut one open the other day like a frog. 
[02:12:00]  Found they got six juggler veins.  One in the knee.  Let's say hi to Kevin.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, ma'am.  Hey, I tell you what.  Don't go to an automatic.  Stick with a pump.  Because when you rack that shell up in there, it's going to make them shit.  Exactly.  I enjoy the pump shotgun.  They're more dependable than an automatic.  More dramatic.  And more dramatic.  I love that sound.  Movie drama.  I love the sound.  Sometimes you rack that motherfucker up, the people go running. 
[02:12:30]  Why don't you get a 30-30?  I was thinking maybe a .50 cal.  Oh, a lever action.  Lever?  Why don't you get a...  I'm going to get me a Winchester.  A Buffalo Bill one.  A six-shooter that I could fan with my hand.  Hey, should we do a...  Pew, pew, pew.  You guys want to do shootouts today?  Take that, partner.  Let's do shootouts today.  Oh, people with their guns?  Yeah.  You guys, if you want to shoot off guns today on the show, give us a call.  This is mostly for our Midwest listeners, not our city listeners.  Patrice is in shock. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  I'm dead serious, man.  That's not fair.  The last time we did this, you should have heard the artillery.  Oh, my God.  Artillery.  Oh, we had some heavy artillery.  All in Wisconsin.  Yeah, yeah.  They're getting ready for some war.  The militia.  The militia.  Why don't you call them?  Call them.  Pay for them.  Is there a Long Island militia?  Is there a Nassau County militia?  They're holding a luncheon this Friday, the Nassau militia.  Pay for some of these guys from Wisconsin who's practicing for the end of the world and fly  them up and let us catch out.  Let them bivouac in my backyard with some tents.  Look how excited we are today. 
[02:13:30]  I am so excited about getting a gun and the potential of one of these guys breaking in  and me offing them.  Someone is asking, why not a dog, Anthony?  Why not a dog?  Dogs.  First of all, the last home invasion, the people were initially alerted by the dog, but  the dog did nothing.  The dog barked.  The woman got up and was accosted.  But see, these people are planning this great because the area you live in, everybody has  the little sissy dogs. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  Yeah.  And no one's going to allow somebody to walk around with a Rottweiler.  It'll be neighborhood pressure to say, hey, no pit bulls, no Rottweiler.  Any dog that have a use for that situation, they're not going to have it.  My neighborhood is the watering hole with the zebras around it and the elk.  They're just sitting there and the tigers and lions and everything are just looking going,  this is some of the easiest shit we're ever going to get. 
[02:14:30]  And something's got to be done.  You're right.  The dogs that I see being walked around the neighborhood are Bichon Frisees and little  Yorkshire Terriers.  It'll be more police that if your Rottweiler attacks a poodle in your neighborhood, it'll  be more police than this home invasion.  And if, like you said, there's some rich Indians and stuff, let's be honest.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  How many white people get home invaded?  These guys are genius, man.  Yeah, they're very smart.  They're robbing Indians.  They know exactly where to go. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, but they don't know.  What are they, sniff a curry first?  I bet you they're staking out, man.  All right, here we go.  You think they're doing a little stakeout first?  We got a guy that his house was broken into.  Ed, I'm, oh, Illinois, actually.  I thought it was L.I.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Yeah.  I drive truck, and I got an assortment of guns, and the shotgun, especially the pump, is  the best.  I was out on the road.  My brother's home, lives with me.  He's about 27 at the time.  Two, no offense to your guest there, two of you guys would call shwoogies broke in there, 
[02:15:30]  and my brother was arguing with him, and he had a ball bat in his hand, and he was getting  nowhere.  You're a shwoogie, Patrice, yes.  My wife came out of the bedroom with shotgun.  I'm sorry to cut you off.  Is the new word for niggas shmoogies out there?  Shwoogie.  Hey, shwoogie.  It's a Boston Jewish term.  We have been using the word shwoogie for many years, Patrice.  Behind our back?  And yes, you are.  Keep us.  Could you keep us updated?  You didn't get that. 
[02:16:00]  The last one I heard was moon cricket, but could you please keep us updated with all the new  You didn't get the mailer?  Yeah, I didn't get shwoogies, you.  You know, I need a new white, white, you know, cracker's getting old.  Cracker's old, yeah.  Listen to this.  The old listeners, they get sick of us telling the stories over and over again, but we got  to tell Patrice where shwoogie came from.  It was Brucey Mittman.  Brucey Mittman, our responsible general manager when we were up in Boston.  Jewish guy.  Jewish guy.  Little short Jewish guy.  Tiny.  He had to be like 5'3".  Drove a suburban.  He almost needed a fucking stepladder to get into it.  This guy was so short. 
[02:16:30]  And so, like, he knew he was short, and he had to do something about it, so he got the  biggest vehicle that rolled off an assembly line.  Napoleon.  At the time, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Napoleon Complex.  Definitely.  And we had raised some money.  Well, we got in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  For something.  At this point, I don't even know what we got in trouble.  I know.  I don't know what it was, but we had done something where we had a charity thing attached  to our CD that we put out.  It was a charity for, what was it?  I got it right there.  I got it right there.  Yeah.  It was the only people that would take our money. 
[02:17:00]  We tried the Jimmy Fund first.  That's where we started.  The money for cancer kids, they wouldn't take our money.  They did not want opium and antimony.  They would rather a kid die of cancer than accept money from the sleaze bags that are opium and  anthony.  So we were trying to do a good thing, because we didn't really make money off this thing.  So we tried breast cancer.  We tried this.  Diseases.  Cancer.  More respected than opium and anthony.  A lot of, yeah.  A lot of diseases said no to opium and anthony.  We don't need your help.  Finally, who came on board?  Well, I'm trying to find the credit now. 
[02:17:30]  Hold on a minute.  Where the heck is it?  On the back, maybe?  Okay.  Can I see that picture?  No.  Because I know what that's going to be.  There's some good pictures on there.  Hold on.  Where the heck is the charity?  Schwuggies.  Schwuggies, yes.  Yeah.  Black people, we really need to come up with some new, all I know is cracker and honky.  Pat from Winaki saying my catchphrase should be, don't fuck with a fancy man.  Very fancy.  Or.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  You've been owned as I finish casting.  Feel the cold steel of my rapier.  No, sir.  I will be using a shotgun.  The charity that finally said yes to us was.  Come on.  The New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans.  New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans.  Took your money.  They were the ones that finally decided to take our money. 
[02:18:30]  Can't you just send money?  No.  Because it was a big presentation.  Oh, so they had to be involved with.  So they had to support it.  Right.  So we obviously were working.  So our boss wanted a little good press.  He went down to deliver the big giant check.  You know the big giant check?  Yeah, the lottery check.  The big giant check.  Really huge.  It's like, what, six feet across or whatever?  And so we had to deliver.  And it was a bunch of black guys that he was giving the check to.  I guess they were minority, homeless, veteran thing. 
[02:19:00]  And he actually was using this to get us out of trouble because we got into some racial shit with another radio station.  That I now remember.  So we got real ugly with a few people and caused a stir up in Boston.  We snapped some pictures of him handing over the check and everything.  But as he's leaving to hand in this huge check to the Shwoogies, he comes in as we're doing our afternoon broadcast, all pissed off going, because of you guys, instead of playing golf, I got to deliver this check to the Shwoogies. 
[02:19:30]  And that's where you heard?  That was the first time I've ever heard it.  But it existed before he said it.  I guess.  I guess in the Jewish community.  Shwoogie.  That's like a.  But this guy likes Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  You know the Shwoogie.  Yeah, how did it spread out to the Midwest?  Ain't that something how.  It's like racism really is like the Internet.  It's like.  It is.  But where are the new white.  How come there are no white terms?  I need a new one. 
[02:20:00]  You employed guy.  What are you going to call him?  Really?  You homeowner.  You responsible father.  We need to mix up.  What's Shwoogie mixed with Swatza and.  Yeah.  And Oodley's.  I don't even know where it comes from.  Yeah, I have no clue where that would come from.  But the root word is.  Origin.  But our general manager who was all pissed off at us because of our racial shit that we  got into.  Yeah.  Comes walking in after giving us a scolding saying he's not going to be able to play golf 
[02:20:30]  that day because he's got to deliver the check to the Shwoogies.  I cannot believe that.  And then he was in the local paper smiling all big with all the black guys around him with  the big check.  I don't believe.  White people never cease to amaze me, man.  I'm trying not to be racist and it's just like thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Shwoogie.  All right.  We should take it.  Good luck, bro.  There's a catchphrase they're saying I should have.  Good luck, bro.  In a thunderous voice.  Headshot.  They're really getting the video game because they know I'm into the first person shooter  video games. 
[02:21:00]  They're really kind of getting that into it.  My catchphrase should be, sir, you are banned.  Because now I ban people from the instant feedback when they're nasty.  Nothing really hit me, though.  I kind of like, I need a good catchphrase.  We'll get a good catchphrase for Anthony today.  Oh, you looked up the word Shwoogie?  It's in.  Shwoogie, a member of the African-American race.  It's a definition in where?  Urban dictionary.  All right, but then the second meaning, it says Shwoogie refers to the Open Anthony show. 
[02:21:30]  Really?  Was what their old boss, Brucie, at radio station WAF in Boston would call black people.  Are we responsible for spreading this word?  I guess we were the ones that-  It's your effing fault.  I guess we technically invented the term.  I think Bruce made it up.  Brucie made it up.  And then we just, through the power of radio, have spread it nationwide.  And then it's used in a sentence, bu-bu-boys, did you see that Shwoogie stealing that car?  Someone said it's a Yiddish word for shadow. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  All right, whatever.  So, let's say hi.  One more call before we go to break.  Tim on Long Island.  Tim?  Yeah, what's up, man?  I laid in bed last night.  I'm watching this fucking pathetic show, Dog the Bounty Hunter.  You ever see that shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Anyway, I'm fucking hearing noises all over my house.  I'm up all fucking night with one hand on my shotgun, the other one on my clicker.  I didn't get any fucking sleep last night waiting for one of these maniacs to break in my house.  Yeah, now every noise you hear outside, I got a fucking raccoon that fucks with the garbage behind the house. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  And it just scares the piss out of me.  You hear something, like, rattle around and go, oh, here it comes.  It's going down.  And there I go.  There I go to my sliding glass door around back with the rapier sword in my hand.  Like, it's hilarious how, like, I'm deathly.  I'm really afraid of white guys like that guy that just called it.  Like, it's just, those white guys seem to be the most dangerous people I've ever heard.  You know, these fucking guys. 
[02:23:00]  Well, I'm fucking there.  And I thought that was Long Island.  I didn't think Long Island was full of, like, citizens who really, like, you know, should be nervous.  I thought it was just a bunch of Italians.  Nah, they're fucking guy with the thingy majiggy.  You fucking get nervous because if I see you in my neighborhood, I'm fucking nervous.  Jesus, listen to that.  I'm on the radio trying to entertain this guy.  How fucking is it?  You come into my fucking neighborhood, huh?  You better fucking book Billy Burr.  You better leave my neighborhood and go to Howard Beach. 
[02:23:30]  They'll fucking treat you better, motherfucker.  Hey, yo, what's up, man?  This is Patrice O'Neal.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, my niggas.

[02:26:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  My friend Anthony just bought a shotgun.  You better watch it, pally.  Better watch where you go now.  I am an armed citizen.  I am part of the armed citizenry of this country now. 
[02:27:00]  My pal Anthony bought a shotgun!  I bowed under to the pressure of the media scare tactics, Opie.  I'm admitting it.  They were scaring us here in New York.  They're frightening the people with all these home invasions.  There's a picture of me I put up on the website for people to photoshop.  Is that your gun?  Yeah.  That's your actual gun?  That's my shotgun.  Go to the other one that shows me and my rapier.  I let people photoshop.  What the hell is wrong with you? 
[02:27:30]  There's me and my rapier and my shotgun.  Are these pictures up?  They've already put pictures.  Yeah, they've already cut that one out and put me fighting Errol Flynn in a movie, which  is really funny.  They put me in action movies.  It's hysterical what they do with the photoshop.  Back up just slightly for the new listeners.  We're gaining new listeners every day.  Yes.  That's how Anthony used to defend himself.  That was my rapier and that was my only means of home defense.  He lives on Long Island and there's an epidemic out there, Bill.  You were in Seattle when we were talking about this yesterday. 
[02:28:00]  I live in Nassau County.  And they're all about the home invasions out there right now.  The one with me just holding the shotgun.  I want someone to photoshop me just in an action figure box.  Doesn't that look like an action figure?  It looks like it's already photoshopped, like you were holding something else in your hand.  And they put a gun in there.  Wow, that's pretty impressive, man.  What kind of gun is that?  That is great.  That is my Remington.  I got my Remington Tactical.  So the same gun the Border Patrol agents use, so I know it can shoot Mexicans. 
[02:28:30]  He bought the gun when you don't know how to shoot.  You get the shotgun.  Just kind of spray it in that general area.  No, for home defense, you want the shotgun.  A lot of people have a lot of different ideas about that.  But it's got the little flashlight right on the pump.  I hit a button on the pump and the flashlight comes on.  And anything that's in the flashlight is getting hit.  It's wonderful.  It's a wonderful weapon.  Turn the flashlight on and shoot.  That's it.  That's how easy it is. 
[02:29:00]  If you can see it, you can kill it.  That's it.  That's their selling point.  And if you see my rippier there, I can take his ear when I'm done.  I just cut it right off and hang it up on the wall.  Well, the pictures are up on opianthony.com.  But just to explain it, Bill, there's home invasions happening in Nassau County.  Nassau County home invasion is going crazy.  Pretty much in Anthony's area, more or less.  Yeah, it's in the area that I live in.  Now, it's gangs, believe it or not, that are coming from Long Island.  There are Long Island gangs.  The M18.  Coming from New York.  No, some of them are out on Long Island in Brentwood. 
[02:29:30]  Well, the fat guys are coming from New York, though.  But the fat guys, there's a gang called the Fat Guys.  They're out of Manhattan.  Then there's the M18.  And then there's the M something 13.  MS-13, was it?  MS-13.  These are like gangs that have come up from South America.  It's a gang of guys that have MS?  Yeah, they're kind of easy to hit.  Police right now, there's a task force and a bounty, a $10,000 reward for information 
[02:30:00]  leading to the capture of these bandits in Nassau County.  Police yesterday revealed there was another home break-in Tuesday.  That must be white people.  They're white gangs?  No, these are bandits.  Bandits.  They put the kerchief around their mouth.  People of color are called hoodlums.  Hoodlums.  If they're white, they're bandits.  Maybe that's Mexican.  Yeah, Mexican.  They're South American.  They come from South America.  They've formed gangs.  They have that X of bullets in front of them.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Like banditos.  That's what they should call them.  Big sombreros.  Hey, gringo.  What do you have in here?  And they always, especially in the movies, they never seem like it's going to be trouble  when you first come up on them.  Hey, amigo, what are you doing here?  They're sitting around the campfire.  You just happen to ride up, and you think everything's going to go.  You want some agua?  Well, I'm just looking for a little water.  I think we have some water for you.  Tell us.  We have some water.  Hey, those are some big saddlebags you have on your horse.  What do you have in?  Oh, no. 
[02:31:00]  There's going to be trouble.  They're all dirty.  There's a freshly raped woman.  Yeah, yeah.  She's very nice, eh, senorita?  Very pretty woman.  Takes his hat off and bows to her like he's going to be a gentleman.  A couple phone calls coming in.  John, go ahead.  Hey, Anthony.  I was wondering if you're going to be doing the Lee Harvey Oswald thing.  Taking pictures of yourselves with their shotgun before you.  Oh, there you go.  That's kind of like what he did.  The pose would go great, photoshopped into the black and white Lee Harvey Oswald picture, too. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I think the photoshop's going to go crazy on whackbag.com today.  The one where he's in the backyard with his gun.  The shotgun in this pit that he killed Pippet with.  Yeah, exactly.  Very nice.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony in North Carolina.  Someone put me on the Channel 7 Eyewitness News page.  Long Island Police Form Home Invasion Task Force, and it's me with my shotgun.  Radio shock jock Anthony Cumia will be heading up the task force.  He is quoted as saying, I am on Swoogie Patrol.  Oh, God.  So, yeah, I bought into it and went down to find folks down at Coliseum Guns down there, 
[02:32:00]  right in Uniondale, right across from the Nassau Coliseum.  Anthony was a little paranoid yesterday there, Bill.  He was starting to feel like he really needed to protect himself.  They break into the houses.  Here's what they do.  They're roving little gangs at about 3 in the morning or so.  They break in to your house.  You're awakened to a gun in your face.  And they tie you. 
[02:32:30]  Here's their M.O. so far.  They tie up the family with the phone cords, anything they could get their hands on.  Then they ransack the place, rip you off, and leave after maybe working you over a little bit.  One guy, the other day, the male homeowner had an NYPD shirt on, but he wasn't a cop.  It's one of those guys that just buy the NYPD shirts.  And they went bullshit on him.  They beat him up a little bit, asking him, where's the gun, motherfucker?  Where's the gun?  Assuming he was a cop and had a gun. 
[02:33:00]  So they worked him over.  I'm just a tourist.  Yeah.  That's what we said.  I bought it after 9-11.  Yeah.  Showing some support.  I have an FDNY shirt, too.  It's not like I'm putting out fires, guys.  Could you not?  Is the whip me?  And, yeah, so I'm hearing all these home invasions right around my area, too, which is a little frightening.  So I figured I'd rearm myself.  I've had guns my whole life.  I've just been through a period of time when I was living in Brooklyn.  And the shotguns, the easiest, just to pull that out from running to the pillow?  Shotgun. 
[02:33:30]  Well, the easiest would probably be a handgun.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But you've got to wait seven months to get a handgun.  Oh, you want to kill people now.  Well, that's what happened in the gun store I went into, Coliseum Guns.  A guy was buying a pistol.  So the sales guy takes his ID and stuff and goes upstairs, comes back down, and he goes,  all right, well, come back three days.  The guy had his waiting period.  Come back, and we'll go through the rest of this.  And the guy did the Simpsons line, the Homer line from the Simpsons.  He goes, but I'm mad now. 
[02:34:00]  They're joking down at the gun store.  It's hysterical.  He goes, but I'm mad now.  And then one of the guys that worked there was saying, he goes, what can I help you with?  I go, I need shotgun home security.  And he goes, ah, boy, are we selling these like hotcakes.  He goes, he sold about eight of them in the past two days, eight shotguns.  And he goes, yesterday, some woman came in with an 80-year-old lady, and they both walked out with shotguns. 
[02:34:30]  An 80-year-old woman, toting some heat.  God bless America.  That's right.  God damn it.  I loved an armed citizenry because here's when the home invasions will stop going up.  They're going up right now.  They're going up.  Here's when they'll start tapering off.  The first one of these motherfuckers that are laying dead in someone's living room because, oops, wrong house. 
[02:35:00]  And they get shot.  Because now it's just easy pickings.  No one's fighting back at all.  They leave their doors open.  Doesn't that make them up the ante?  No, no.  It really makes them go.  What happens is there was a gang of guys that are ripping these houses off.  No research in this.  No, we got a mic in front of us.  We got a mic in front of us.  Hear this, Mike?  It doesn't work this way.  We're experts.  That's all it takes.  Here's what happens.  If you want to be an expert at home, just get a microphone.  You get a gang.  They start ripping off these places.  It makes the news. 
[02:35:30]  Now you get other people sitting back on, you know, something.  Look how easy this is.  These guys have been getting away with this every single time.  Why don't we just go around, check some open doors, look around garages, windows, and start breaking in.  These people don't even fight back.  And it's worked.  And now these things are getting more often.  Can I use the word brazen?  We're brazen.  I love that word.  Very nice.  And it's just going to take some time.  It has to be daylight hours for it to be brazen.  It would.  Brazen would have to be daylight.  You're right.  Three in the morning isn't very brazen. 
[02:36:00]  Through an open window.  Unarmed house.  That's not brazen at all, is it?  There's nothing brazen about that.  Daylight robbing a precinct.  Let me ask you this.  That's brazen.  At what point can you shoot them and it's like, it's okay?  If they're walking down the street in my neighborhood and they're of any color but white, then you are completely within your rights to shoot him.  Self-defense?  It is self-defense.  He intended to rob somebody.  That's pretty much it.  I believe the law goes, if you feel that your life is in danger, you can then use deadly force. 
[02:36:30]  Is that gray?  It's kind of gray.  There are some real specifics you have to stick to, but it really is.  If you feel, it doesn't even have to actually be that your life is threatened.  If you feel your life is being threatened, you can take that person's life.  You can use deadly physical force.  If someone's in your house, if they don't show a weapon, they're in your house, but they are menacing you, your family, and you feel that you are in danger of being killed, you can kill that person. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, it'll go through a grand jury and all that shit.  It's not going to be like they come back, pat you on the back, and go, all right, sir, here's your gun.  It's not like the end of Bonanza.  There's always shit.  No, and then whoever you shot, if they don't die, you probably got a lawsuit on your hands.  If they do die, you probably got a family lawsuit on your hands where some lawyer will come out of the woodwork and say this poor individual was just looking for blah, blah, blah. 
[02:37:30]  He was drunk.  He was on drugs.  He thought it was the wrong house.  He needed this, that, the other.  There's always problems.  But the bottom line is it's much better to have to deal with that than it is having to deal with the memory of your wife or girlfriend being raped in front of you.  Has that happened yet?  You being shot.  In these cases of home invasions, no.  That's a very irresponsible statement he just made.  No, because now I'm just with his microphone. 
[02:38:00]  Like it hasn't happened on Long Island?  Like there's never been a home invasion with a rape involved or a murder?  However, it's much better to have to deal with that.  I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6, my friend, if I may quote somebody from Alabama.  So congratulations, Anthony.  I am an armed citizen.  Don't fuck with me, buster.  Yeah, and the pictures are up on opandanthony.com.  A very, very impressive. 
[02:38:30]  You might want to shoot a few times.  Dude, it's not like this isn't me running into a gun store never shooting before.  I probably shot more guns than somebody that's been in the army.  Believe me.  My whole youth was spent shooting weapons.  That's all I did as a kid.  My 13th birthday, I got a pistol.  My father bought me a pistol and a girl for my 13th birthday.  That's what I got.  I got laid and got to shoot a gun off after it. 
[02:39:00]  I got a 10-speed bike.  You knew we had one of those raccoon, those Davy Crockett hats?  Oh, yeah.  Because that was the hit show when he was 18 in 1955.  I was not watching Davy Crockett.  I had a cowboy hat, though.  It was like in a very equestrian area I grew up in.  Calm down.  And I had the whole schmear.  And I got a holster, a nice low-slung holster.  I had my six-gun that I got for my birthday. 
[02:39:30]  And I'd saddle up my horse and went out there and did some shooting.  And that's what I did.  All right.  And it was nonstop shooting ever since.  Hey, guys.  This is Master Poe.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Now we got Joey.  40 minutes to get through security?  Yeah.  I didn't know it was like an airport.  You didn't tell me to come two hours before the show to get in.  Please show up.  Yeah.  Check with your local carriers.  Mr. Poison, I'm sorry to ask you this, but you're going to have to bend over.  Spread your cheeks.  Yeah.  Why?  Does Master Poe realize that Joey's a friend of ours? 
[02:40:00]  I'm not sure.  Did you have to show ID?  I had to show ID, take pictures.  Take pictures.  I don't understand the picture thing.  Sit down.  How many things to sign?  How much to sign?  You know, I actually didn't.  I don't think I signed anything, but.  40 minutes to just take pictures?  Come on.  What happens?  Because now we got a friend that went through the process.  So you show up like, hey, I'm here to see Opie and Anthony.  I'm here to see Opie and Anthony.  What happens?  It's like, why?  It's like, well, because they asked me to stop up. 
[02:40:30]  Who asked you to stop up?  I'm like, uh, Opie?  So there's a whole, like, interrogation.  You know, all those karate moves that he does is cute and all, but does he realize what a gun can do?  Oh, boy.  What an idiot.  Uh-oh.  So, and then what?  And then he takes your picture?  Then he takes my picture.  It takes your ID.  What is the picture for?  I want to know where I live, where I work, what I do.  All my phone numbers. 
[02:41:00]  Email addresses.  How old is my mom?  It was kind of a little weird.  He asked your email address?  He said, for what?  Why are these questions being asked?  I want to know why.  Are you on a mailing list for XM?  There's no reason to have email addresses.  Why?  It's a little weird because he usually spends that much time with the really hot chicks.  Not with the dudes and not with the fat chicks.  The fat chick could walk right in here and get on the air within 30 seconds.  Yeah, with a machete.  If you're a hot chick, then you have to spend a long time in Master Poe's little booth as he takes your picture 
[02:41:30]  and tries to see if he could, you know, bang you.  I don't think people need to be put through this.  Ben, what's going on with this?  Seriously.  What is this?  Does Poe know that Joey's a really good friend of ours?  For one of our meetings in Washington, everyone has to go through this process.  It takes a long time.  Why?  Whose idea?  Talk to the lawyers.  Why do they want it?  It doesn't matter if it's Opie's brother, if it's your brother.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  My brother will not be going through that.  Trust me.  He might pay $100 when he goes out, but he's not going to be photographed. 
[02:42:00]  My brother will not be going through that.  Anthony's brother will not be going through that.  Well, they've actually already been here.  Our friends will not be going through that.  Only the first time they have to do it?  Well, he's been here before, but since one of our last trips to Washington, all the paperwork had changed.  No, our friends and family are not going to be treated like criminals, okay?  Neither should guess.  How about this?  You sign something and you're in.  That's it.  Because once again, it's a false sense of security. 
[02:42:30]  A bunch of lawyers who have nothing else to do get together.  They put their greedy, stupid faces together, and this is what they come up with.  40 minutes of bullshit.  I don't understand why we need to take pictures of the guests that come up here.  Poe can explain it because he knows why.  Can we have him in to explain?  Yes.  Maybe they just told him that's what he has to do.  Mr. Poe, you've insulted my friend Joey here.  Do you know that?  I'm not even kidding.  Joey has been disrespected. 
[02:43:00]  Joey.  I know he's your friend.  Pull down your pants.  What are you doing?  That's the attitude.  Why are they pulled up so high?  I'm wearing them.  Unfortunately, the new process is to take care of all paperwork.  Everyone that comes in, I can't hear.  He said it took 40 minutes.  Well, what happens, something happened with my computer.  I had to reboot a couple of times.  What kind of paperwork is it?  What do they actually do?  It's just basic paperwork.  You have two forms, the kind that we had ever since we started. 
[02:43:30]  Unfortunately, Joe came here for the first time a long time ago, and we had a hard copy.  So this is a computerized copy.  The next time he comes in, it's only going to take him maybe five minutes.  It shouldn't even take that.  It should take one minute.  Hey, how are you?  It's Joey.  Why next time is there anything?  What is there next time?  Every time someone arrives, they have to do the paperwork.  They have to sign the paperwork.  This is the new protocol as per conversation that we had three weeks ago. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, I'm not saying you came up with it.  I'm saying it's ridiculous.  Whose idea was it?  What lawyer in Washington has to have somebody?  Did Flavor Flav have to fill anything out before he went on the air?  Well, Flavor Flav, unfortunately, was rushed in here, and I have to get all the information  from his publicist.  But the lawyers, the lawyers would have actually had him go into that office at quarter to ten  and fill out fucking paperwork.  And not be on the show.  This is a stupid radio show.  Yeah.  This is a NASA. 
[02:44:30]  What about the pictures?  Why are people's pictures being taken?  Pictures?  You need a picture ID.  Yeah, but why are people's pictures being taken?  Because the picture will go on their paperwork.  See?  So any time that you look at the paperwork, you actually have a picture that goes with  the paperwork.  Eventually, there's going to be so much red tape and paperwork that we're not even going  to be able to do a show anymore.  How about a retina scan, Washington lawyers?  How about a nice retina scan when you walk in?  That'll be a little bit here.  What's the reason for all this? 
[02:45:00]  Besides their picture, you also have their license.  I know.  You disrespected Joey a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Joe, no disrespect intended.  I knew you were a friend, but it had to be done.  That's all right, Paul.  You did okay.  It's all right.  It's not.  Now get your fucking shine box.  Wait.  There's a picture and his license?  That's good, Anthony.  It's like a double ID thing?  His picture has to be taken and the license photocopy?  Did you yell at me, Anthony? 
[02:45:30]  What's that?  Photocop...  Wait.  His license and his photo.  I don't understand why there has to be eight...  How many photos of Joey do we need?  How many pictures are on there?  This is XM's.  No, I think you're hot, but I mean...  This...  I only need one.  It's like the license.  That's all you need.  Paul's giving out wallet-sized portraits.  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  Could you smile by the flag and tilt your head?  This is not a wedding.  I know.  I know Joey's wanted for something, but let's all calm down here.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, he's not used to taking one from the front without another from the side. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Can you put a ruler behind him?  Yeah, you did good.  You filled out your paperwork like a man.  You didn't give anybody up.  Here is your photo ID, which is nice and clear, and I take the picture myself personally.  This is your ID from your New York driver's license, and sometimes the picture is not that clear.  Right.  So I need to have both of them.  So the license is clear enough for a cop who pulls you over, but not clear enough for the lawyers in Washington. 
[02:46:30]  A cop physically takes it out and looks at it, whereas this goes through a computer and then goes through a printer.  Well, a computer, that's what they use when they photograph from the air when we're in a war.  They will photograph from the air, and they filter it through a computer.  So it's good enough for that, but you can't get a license into a computer so the fucking XM lawyers are happy.  Right.  How about this? Get us a better photocopier.  There's less security at the airports.  Is the picture... 
[02:47:00]  Is Joey flying anywhere that we don't know about?  Did you confiscate scissors from him out of a duffel bag when he walked in?  The picture that you take besides the license picture, because the license picture doesn't come out clear enough, right?  Correct.  Clear enough for what?  That we might mistake someone else for Joey as we're looking at license pictures on Xerox?  Can I see it?  Nope, that's Joey.  Can I ever look at those photos?  I know.  Can I look at it?  Absolutely.  The photos, they go into one folder in my computer, in my hard drive.  And then the ID, the IDs go into another folder. 
[02:47:30]  What the hell is going on?  I don't understand.  Because they have nothing else to do in Washington, Anthony.  That's why.  I'm not going to give away the answers.  Let's just say birth name, title, maiden name, legal name, also known as...  They have an AKA on this list.  Mailing address, city-state zip, picture ID number one, picture ID number two, driver's 
[02:48:00]  license number.  Who gives a shit what his driver's license number is?  Date of birth and age, because you can't have one.  You have to have both.  Social security.  Why do we need a social security number?  It's none of our fucking business.  There is no reason whatsoever to put a social security number.  Alias, if any.  Alias, if any.  Joey Salmonella Paisano.  Time in, time out. 
[02:48:30]  Witness.  Witness.  And it actually says Master Poe as the witness.  I'm the one who witnessed him fucking...  You need a witness for the...  That is ridiculous.  Website.  Website.  Website.  Home phone number.  Work phone number.  Mobile number.  Expiration date.  And please sign.  This is fucking ludicrous.  Website.  Eatabullet.com.  What are you supposed to do? 
[02:49:00]  Gives a shit.  Stress factory tonight.  Why don't you just put down for phone number 888-541-HA-HA.  That is revolting.  Why is a social security number, which is your key to your life here in the United States  of America?  Why is that needed here?  Could someone from Washington call us and explain this?  Because this is really weird.  Get Elo on the phone immediately.  He actually called me back yesterday, and I forgot to call him back. 
[02:49:30]  Did he?  I just missed each other.  Oops.  If they call and they tell me to take out all this, I will.  However, when I first started, we had how many pages?  Nine?  I understand.  Nine pages.  I consolidated nine into two.  You're just brilliant.  Nine into two.  Well, it's just that it takes so long.  No, no, wait, wait, wait, no.  Because then if I had nine, that means you would have, Joey, we would have been out there  for two hours.  But no, we were out there for only 40 minutes because my computer kept on going.  Look at that stack of papers as big as your fucking head. 
[02:50:00]  I understand you're doing your job, but you got to call Washington and say the guys just  don't get this.  And maybe you could get an explanation and Monday or Tuesday you could come in and explain  it to us.  We need an explanation because it's ridiculous.  You're still here?  I told you to go fill out your paperwork, bang, boom.  The information that's on this paperwork was also on the other paperwork.  And I knew Joey was a friend.  I knew Joey was a friend.  Did you send him through the metal detector?  No, no, I took care of him.  I let him sit down. 
[02:50:30]  I let him relax and listen to the show.  No, he didn't go through the metal detector?  No.  Good move.  Wow.  The social security number thing is weird.  That's only needed if you're looking up people's finances.  I checked to see if there was any bulges on the side.  I didn't know.  There wasn't.  Can I ask why there's one line for alias and one line for also known as?  What is the difference between also known as and alias?  That's the same thing.  The redundancy of the legal system comes out in little moments like that.  You know what is really amazing? 
[02:51:00]  Our guests, people that come in here, have to fill that out.  I work for XM.  I didn't fill out anything nearly as in-depth as that is to come in here.  They pay me.  I come in here every day.  They don't know any aliases I have.  They don't know.  Cell phone numbers.  They don't know.  I didn't fill out a form like that to work here.  Yeah.  I never saw any paperwork that said, Benny the Bulge sparked. 
[02:51:30]  It's just another false sense of security is all it is.  Master Poe, do you understand how many guns are in this building right now?  Do you want to guess?  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  How many guns in the building?  We'll find out later on CJ.  Many people come to radio stations armed and dangerous.  But we'll talk with Master Poe, whoa. 
[02:52:00]  On CJ, oh boy.  Let's just put it this way.  There's more than one.  That's good.  That means we're safe.  There's more than one in this building right now, okay?  That's wonderful.  I would put the number at about three today.  Okay.  All right.  Does Keith, now Keith just walks in here.  I'm just saying.  Does he?  I'm just saying.  Well, he's a police officer.  Keith is a police officer.  Keith is a friend of yours.  I got to say, when Joey handed me his gun, it kind of turned me on. 
[02:52:30]  You ever make Karen fill out paperwork again, and I'll kill you.  Master Poe is making people fill out paperwork up there.  I want everyone to know.  Master Poe makes people fill out paperwork up there.  Carrion. 
[02:53:00]  Carrion.  I should be carrion AIDS and drinking it.  No improv skills, fat-pitted zilch.  Hey, Randy from New York City, listen to this one.  Randy, go ahead, buddy.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, when Barry Williams shows up, does he have to put his alias down as Johnny Bravo?  Yo, later, punch it out.  Might have to do that.  Let me tell you something, too.  Randy had a perfect phone call for the show today.  Yeah.  Got his thing done, and he's out. 
[02:53:30]  Bam.  Perfect example of what we want from you guys.  George, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Morning.  Hello, my Jelly Roll baby.  Hi, how are you?  He got on a plane yesterday in 20 minutes.  What?  Yeah, he got on a plane in 20 minutes.  Yeah.  From curb to plane, 20 minutes.  I got from curb to plane in 20 minutes.  I went through security, had two carry-on bags.  They took my shoes off.  I got on the plane and went home.  You guys are awful.  I'm punching out.  Bye, fella.  All right.  And one more from Kansas.  Nick, go ahead.  Hey, what the fuck is being done with all that information that Master Poe has taken? 
[02:54:00]  Who sees it?  Who has access to it?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That's it.  Your whole fucking life is right there on that fucking piece of paper.  You know something?  Talk about identity theft.  Everything that is on that paper is more than all you need to steal someone's identity,  credit card fraud, just completely screw up someone's financial life for years and years 
[02:54:30]  to come based on just what is there.  There's everything you need there.  Yeah.  There's pictures.  There's license, social security, aliases, names, phone numbers, addresses, everything  you need.  I cannot believe it.  Master Poe, just find out what they're doing with all this.  I'm not even kidding.  It's just ridiculous.  Maiden name.  Is there any...  I can see name, phone number, do you consent to be on the radio, and license.  That's what you use as a security code when you call your bank. 
[02:55:00]  Things like that.  Mother's maiden name.  Things like that.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Unbelievable that that is even asked for and that people give it.  Especially when you have a license.  If they don't like the way the licensing is, how about a better scanner?  How about that?  Instead of wasting time taking a picture.  There's two photos of him at the top.  I don't know if this is true, but I got to go to Jim in Oklahoma.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  No, that's fine.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, I go in and out of nuclear power plants with a truck, and I get in and out of there. 
[02:55:30]  I get in there in about five minutes.  Five minutes when he's delivering to nuclear power plants.  He is in the facility with a truck in five minutes.  But people have to spend up to 40 minutes to get on this dopey radio show.  Well, if you had to go through this security, you'd never make it, because when you accidentally  listed your website as Ihaveabombinthetrunk.com, they would stop you. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Larry on Long Island.  Larry, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Big Nuts Norton.  What's your story?  Larry, you're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  Listen, I got a question for Joey from Paisanos.  Yeah.  Do you really think that three onions is necessary for the sauce?  You don't need three onions.  Do you think three onions is necessary for the sauce?  You don't need three onions.  You don't get that information right now.  All right.  Well, that's great. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, my God.  Put in your sugar or a little wine.  Some sausage.  You know what?  One other thing we just got to mention here, this whole false sense of security, because  I don't know.  They got bulletproof glass and Kevlar.  Oh, it's crazy.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  We have an assigned assassin.  Yeah.  That's kind of like our protector.  But Anthony and I walk here at a certain time with the dregs of society on the sidewalk. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  I know.  I'm tripping over homeless people.  Black Escalade's just driving up and down 57th Street.  You never know what's going to pop out of that at any given time.  But thank God through 15 locked doors, I'm safe.  Right.  Once I get through the 15 locked doors alone, then I'm in here.  I'm safe.  You got delivery trucks parked right in front of the building with suspicious characters.  Yeah.  Who cares, right?  Guys in cabs that have never picked up a passenger.  Oh. 
[02:57:30]  But we're safe out there, Anthony, as we come to work.  I was walking today.  I see two dogs.  One's looking one way.  One's looking the other.  I'm in the middle.  I saw Anthony today.  It's pitch dark out there.  And Anthony goes, hey.  And I jump like 10 feet.  I go, hey, oh.  Ah.  But as soon as we get in the building, we're nice and secure, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's great.  Unbelievable.  The Opie and Anthony Show Award for most disturbing phone call goes to donkey sausage. 
[02:58:00]  What the?  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in the microwave.  And then have her roll around in that screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Dude, Jimmy Dean's donkey sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage! 
[02:58:30]  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something oddly attractive about that.  That's got to be a promo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, nice.  Filtering out a fortune.  I'm Chris Whitting with the Success Journal.  For Vince Morata, mornings began with a fresh, hot cup of coffee.  Vince was a busy Ohio real estate executive.  He found that brewing a pot of coffee with his old-fashioned percolator was quite a hassle. 
[02:59:00]  That's when he got the idea to build a better coffee maker.  Vince's new automatic drip device was not only faster and easier to use,  it also kept his Java fresh-tasting far longer than other machines.  In no time, that coffee maker ground up the competition.  The clever design was a real wake-up call for the appliance industry.  I'm sure you know the name of the creation.  Mr. Coffee.  It's still America's favorite coffee maker, 
[02:59:30]  thanks to a mister named Morata, who loved good coffee.  With the Success Journal, I'm Chris Whitting.  Wee! I just got wowed!  That's a big ol' hootie toner.  Let me see you and buddy!

I know you're listening.  Thank you.  It's not pronounced that way. 
[03:02:00]  Knitters.  What are you talking about?  Are you a knitter lover?  Teasing that.  It's really a slow news day.  We're going to tell you right off the bat.  Oh my God, and we can tell by the stories.  Yeah, so we're going to go into game mode today.  Don't worry, we're going to have a fine show.  All right, let me unzip.  But they did a story on the news proving that it's a slow news day.  Maybe we should get the audio.  We weren't really thinking of getting the audio, but maybe we should.  Oh, just so awful.  I guess knitting is becoming very, very popular. 
[03:02:30]  Is it though, or is it just...  It used to be something that grandmas did, but now they're trying to claim that all generations  are knitting.  Everything gets trendy, and now apparently knitting is something that people are doing together.  There's knitting clubs, and families getting together to knit together.  I've never heard of it.  Knit.  I never did either.  And I never did either.  I think the news makes this shit up.  And that's the key to the story they just told on the news. 
[03:03:00]  I think the news goes, let's make knitting a fad.  Right.  Or try to.  And then they do a story and try to make it sound like everyone's doing this.  But they had knitters, you know.  They had some women.  They had the typical knitters.  Yeah.  The kids.  The grandkids with the, you know, grandparents.  You could see them knitting with each other, right?  Yeah.  Grandmas all together.  They love the knitting.  A few middle-aged women.  You're like, all right, well, sure, why not?  I'm sure there's a few out there that are knitting. 
[03:03:30]  It's relaxing.  And then there's some college girls.  All right.  I could kind of see that.  Sure.  Maybe not a big market, but you could see maybe a few college girls knitting.  Spare time.  Then they showed the guys.  The guys that are involved, you know.  And they have to say, and it's not just the women that are knitting.  A lot of men have taken up knitting, and they talk to the guys.  And it was just, I mean, first you could just tell from looking. 
[03:04:00]  And then when the audio came on.  It's so relaxing.  I could sit and knit, and I don't have to think about work or anything else like that that's upsetting.  It's all so relaxing.  I could do it right here at home in my robe.  And it's one, every guy that they put on.  It wasn't just like, eh, you know, when the football season ends or something, nothing to do. 
[03:04:30]  I like to pick up a knitting needle.  Yeah.  Knit a little.  It relaxes me a little bit.  You know, and I'm done with the job.  I'm a mechanic.  I'm working on cars all day, and my hands, I like touching something soft like some yawn.  And so I knit.  I knit.  That's what I do.  But no.  No.  And this man's been knitting for just a couple of months, and he seems to be doing very well with himself.  So it's just such a wonderful thing to do with people.  It's such a great get-together. 
[03:05:00]  And we're.  Men are not knitting.  Gay men are knitting.  We were both making the butthead face at the TV light.  Oh, we couldn't say a word to each other.  We were like.  It's the.  Face where you're just staring at the TV going.  Men knitting.  No.  No.  Jay.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Jay.  Morning.  Good times, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, I've been knitting my whole life, man. 
[03:05:30]  I learned how to knit from my dad, believe it or not.  Hold on.  Sometimes it gets a bad rap, cocksucker.  What exactly is it you get at a knitting?  Well, I live in Wisconsin.  You got winter socks.  The winter socks get holes in them.  You have to darn the holes in them.  So my wife is from Milwaukee.  She's a city girl.  That's not knitting.  That's primitive sewing.  You don't darn holes in socks.  You throw the socks away and get another fancy pair.  Hold on.  You know what, Anthony?  Maybe you have the money and this faggot doesn't.  So hold on a second, sir.  I don't like the fact. 
[03:06:00]  So I apologize for Anthony's fancy attitude.  What exactly, ball licker, did you exactly get?  How often do you knit?  Well, usually about two or three times during the winter, you know, doing the end of your socks and everything.  You know, they got the.  The it's basically like your wool socks where they got the fancy tips on the front of them.  Yeah, right, right.  My fanciness.  And then, you know, the thread in between there comes apart.  You just sew them back up.  It's not a big deal.  That's sewing.  It's not like, well, but it's you're doing it. 
[03:06:30]  That's a chick's job.  Yeah.  Sir, how often do you do it?  Do you tend to do it when there's a hole and you're lactating, you fucking woman?  Stop doing that.  Leave the knitting to the broads.  It's not like I make little panties or anything.  I mean.  There's another hole this guy deals with in the side of a bathroom stall.  To knit yourself some knee pads and blow a stranger in a truck stop.  Jesus. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, knit yourself a shotgun and put it in your mouth, stupid.  Oh, what a creep.  Lonely idiot in the Midwest just knitting.  It doesn't get cold enough for me to start knitting.  No, not at all.  I understand it gets cold up there in Wisconsin.  But, jeez.  Knitting.  Stop it.  Let's go to Philly.  We understand Philly a little bit more than Wisconsin at this point in our careers.  John, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's Jimmy giving that guy shit for?  Jimmy sits around with his pita butt knitting all day.  Ha ha. 
[03:07:30]  Pita friends.  That's right.  We do knit because we don't need to wear fur.  So we knit ourselves sweaters.  What'd you knit in Philly?  A rock to throw at a pregnant woman?  You fucking hateful Philadelphia people.  They would never knit anything helpful.  No.  Of course not.  And, John, fuck your Flyers, man.  That was a goal last night at the end of the game.  What's that?  Did you watch the Flyers game last night?  No.  I'm from New York.  I just have to live here for work.  Fucking Frazier should be teabagged. 
[03:08:00]  Why did he do something good?  Huh?  The Islanders scored right at the end of the game.  There was still enough time on the clock and everything.  Go home.  No.  Just go home.  No, no, no.  Guys, not sick.  Just went down the wrong pipe.  We understand you need a day off.  Just go.  Just go.  I was at the Green Bay game Sunday.  Yeah.  And they were getting on my buddy's 10-year-old kid for wearing a Brett Farm jersey.  They were relentless.  But, anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  James from Toronto knows who that guy was. 
[03:08:30]  He said his father taught him to knit.  I believe you were speaking with Robert Reed Jr.  Hey, we got the knitting story.  God.  Guys are knitting.  This might be worth playing.  Gay gentlemen are knitting.  Knitting is all the rage, according to the news here in New York City.  No, it's not.  Anyone who knits will tell you it's very satisfying to make something you can wear or something you can give as a gift.  Sure.  Even.  It's a very popular hobby. 
[03:09:00]  By the way, this is our favorite morning newscast.  Yes.  It's the gay gentleman.  Who doesn't appear gay.  No, he acts as straight as he could possibly be.  Then he trips up.  No one, especially in New York, is going to accept that from their news anchor.  And then you got the weather guy.  And every once in a while, they go at it with each other because there's an underlying dislike for each other.  Yeah, between the weather man and the weather guy.  And the weather guy, in all fairness, has his own problems.  He's very narcissistic. 
[03:09:30]  Too cool for the room.  Too cool for the room.  Really enjoys how he looks on camera.  Most important weather man ever, ever.  Very swarmy.  Yeah, he's swarmy.  He's what?  He's very swarmy.  Oh, swarmy, what is the weather going to be?  No, he's swarmy.  Five million other weather men that look exactly like him invade a place.  Bunch of weather men on a Volkswagen in the Houston Astrodome being frozen.  Yeah, we don't need the anchor fight.  People know the fight these two did a while back. 
[03:10:00]  It was legendary.  Sorry.  So this is the same newscast.  And so the news guy is involved with the knitting story.  Yeah, at the end.  And he lets his gayness out a little bit at the end of the story.  He always does.  It slips out from time to time when these stories come out.  But a lot of stitching buffs are learning that this age-old craft for another reason as well.  Lucy Yang explains why many are calling the new yoga.  Knit one, purl two, a stitch in time can save the mind. 
[03:10:30]  The age-old craft of knitting is becoming the trendiest way to chill out.  No, it's not.  No.  Know what I know knits.  It's not.  You made this up.  One person said it's relaxing there in the workplace.  Like one person that works at the news place is knitting.  And someone commented on it.  And you go, you know, it's just so relaxing.  We should do a story on how relaxing knitting is.  This is not taking off.  Well, you can use the word trend. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  This is going to be as big as the pet rock?  Unless you see it everywhere.  What happened, Jimmy?  I just saw those penguins and I wanted to knit myself a bat.  But you were just saying yesterday you don't like when animals are beat up.  Penguins are different.  They're arrogant.  They're trying to be people.  Get off your hind legs, faggots.  Slither on your fat penguin bellies.  March of the Penguins was a wonderful movie.  Did you see it?  No, absolutely not.  Have not seen it.  Absolutely not.  All right, here we go.  More knitting.  It puts you in a certain frame of mind where you're just stepping back. 
[03:11:30]  And you have that time to get within yourself.  What?  Unless you drop a stitch.  And there is a growing number of stores where knitters can indulge their hobbies.  Like Point, a knitting cafe in Manhattan's East Village.  Here, knitter wannabes can learn the craft while seasoned hands can.  They're white guys with their hats sideways.  Fucking knitters.  White knitter.  A house next door was sold to a knitter. 
[03:12:00]  A knitter cook.  Oh, some knitter hit me on the head with a shovel.  Oh, my ribs. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, I'm so happy.  A knitter?  We would keep it with the knitters.  They're animals anyway.  Let them lose their yawn.  All right, here we go.  More audio from the knitting story.  In Manhattan's East Village. 
[03:13:00]  Here, knitter wannabes can learn the craft while seasoned hands can buy yarn, then put in some serious needle time while enjoying a cup of Joe.  There's a sense of community.  There's knitters all over.  All right, this is what we were talking about.  Here's the guy.  Great sense of community.  Here's, we get the first guy.  Join a cup of Joe.  There's a sense of community.  There's knitters all over.  And you meet them and, you know, always exchanging ideas.  Exchanging ideas.  Yeah.  They've been knitting.  It's called a big quilt. 
[03:13:30]  I need to help with this stitch.  Oh, shit.  Could I give you a hand?  Would you?  Would you?  He pushed the needles in the basket.  Oh, cup of Joe.  Knitting himself some tits.  No, it's just really sad the way he's going.  He's trying to knit himself next to 30 pounds. 
[03:14:00]  Holy shit.  Wow.  What are you doing?  Just knitting myself some healthy friends.  Oh, yeah, that's a good suggestion.  Huh.  Let's see.  Pete from Virginia.  They should call themselves a knit dicks. 
[03:14:30]  We hate all knit dicks.  All right, we got a little more audio.  They talked to a few more guys here.  Store owner Helene Blumfield says knitting is shedding its duffy image, becoming a multi-generational pastime.  No, it's not.  You'll see people from all walks of life that you would never see together, sitting together, working together, sharing experiences.  Stitch Therapy in Park Slope has knitting and crocheting circles. 
[03:15:00]  Owner Maxine de Gutz gave up her job in the corporate world and has not looked back.  I was fortunate that I've been knitting since I'm a child and I was able to fall back on it and use my business know-how to develop the business.  That's a girl, actually.  No way.  I think that was the owner.  Really?  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, Maxine.  She was a knitter, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, she certainly was a knitter.  She really, really looked like a knitter.  Is there a sign in my yard that says, dead knitter storage? 
[03:15:30]  What the business?  According to the Craft Yarn Council of America, the percentage of knitters and crocheters has doubled during the last 10 years to 18%.  Besides its therapeutic value, bright colors, funky textures, and fun patterns are making stitching more appealing.  And just seeing their garment take form, it's very rewarding as well because you have a finished product in the end.  And not just for women, more men are coming into the circle. 
[03:16:00]  It's kind of like meditation where you're doing something that's so, in some ways, monotonous that takes you out of your element.  Lucy Yang, Channel 7.  Anything to take your mind off the fact that you like a cock in your ass.  Please.  Knit one, purl two.  Knit one, purl two.  Dick in the ass.  Knit one, purl two.  Well, I imagine that lifestyle is kind of monotonous too.  Push it in my ass, pull it out of my ass.  Push it in my ass, pull it out of my ass. 
[03:16:30]  Push it in my ass, pull it out of my ass.  Jesus.  All right, so then the story's over and now we go back to the anchor.  Yeah.  We go back to the anchor desk.  Mm-hmm.  Where he trips up again.  Where he lets a little of his gayness out.  We could use taking out of our element once in a while.  Kind of like Zen, you know?  Yeah, I imagine it's nice for some.  Remember Rosie Greer was one of the first ones?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look how mellow he was, right?  Very mellow.  Rosie Greer.  He was in at 6.30. 
[03:17:00]  He's got beautiful clothes, too.  Still ahead of me to see this one.  A murder mystery making headlines as police search for a dancer's killer.  Now her ex-boyfriend's family is speaking out about the investigation.  Also, police released surveillance video.  Love the message.  We're a little long there, but there you go.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Bobby Bigrig.  Bobby?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Step away from the needles or the knitter gets it.  Later. 
[03:17:30]  Missouri's checking in.  Bulldog, what's up?  Hey, two knitters just stole my truck.  Do you fucking believe me?  Two knitters just stole my truck.  Steven?  You know who goes to jail?  Knitters stick up, men.  Steve in New York.  What's up?  I'm full asleep in the getaway car.  Go ahead, Steve.  I want to know how long it takes to knit an extra 100 T-cells.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:18:00]  What happened?  Someone fell.  Uh, Jay.  I'm an alabama knitter and I want to be free.  Punch him out.  All right.  You know.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  I guess, uh, it's the sheriff is a nit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And the gay guy says, uh, knit one, pearl necklace. 
[03:18:30]  Knit two, pearl necklace.  All right.  Very good.  Love the people on instant feedback.  Yeah.  Here's something you're never going to hear anyone ever say.  I think I'll never be going to go eat a pussy.  Never been said.  Never will.  I can't do it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:19:00]  Did you just shit your pants?  No, but if I pushed any harder.  Wow.  Yeah.  There would have been a mishap.  Whoever sent this in, Hawk just gave me a note.  Could knitters be called yarn apes?  That's not bad.  Holy shit.  I see what's happening here.  That was some, uh, junk 69.  I think there's a play on words going.  I just realized there's a play on words going on. 
[03:19:30]  I was talking about knitters.  Oh.  All right.  Wow.  Anyway, let's go back to the phones really fast, and we're going to move on to other  things, but Rick in Connecticut has something.  Rick.  Ramone, knit me a row.  Very good.  I think we're going to move on from this, but, uh.  There was one guy that sent one in.  Yeah.  Where is it, Hawk?  Brian in Chicago.  Brian in Chicago.  Hey, uh, is it okay to say either, uh, knitter or knitta?  Yeah, are we allowed to say knitter or knitta?  Eh, either way. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  They're not knitters.  They're Afghan Americans.  Afghan Americans.  Wow.  Oh.  Little fuckers.  Um, this is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, and I hope you're enjoying it, and  I hope you're laughing, because that's our goal.  If we can just put a smile on the face of one retarded child.  Hey, we've got to say hi to Jim Norton.  Jimmy!  Stop.  Can you guys hear me?  Of course we can hear you.  Jimmy.  I can't hear you, maybe because the air conditioner's too loud in here.  Hold on a second.  Isn't it like, isn't it like midnight in Los Angeles? 
[03:20:30]  What time is it?  It's, uh, 4-12 in L.A.  It's, um, hold on.  It's, uh, oh yeah, a little after four, I've got to go to bed, because I've got to get up.  I just had to, I had to leave the apartment that I was staying in, though.  Why?  Dude, this whole trip has been just a fucking disaster.  Of course it has.  Oh, Jimmy.  Sound flustered.  Before I leave, the last thing I said, all right, let me treat myself.  I'll go out, I'll get a girl.  Like, this is in New York.  Like, I go to her place, she was recommended to me by a federal police officer. 
[03:21:00]  He said she's great, because she has a big clit.  I get there, she's about 270 pounds.  Um, I'm like, all right, let me just see, well, maybe I'll do it, make the most of it,  because I'm leaving.  We're making out, she tells me I shouldn't touch her back, because she has Ben Gay on  her back.  Yeah.  Because she has really heavy tits, so she's got Ben Gay on her back, and then she stands  up and she shows me she has fat feet, and she says she has legodermia.  Legodermia?  Which is kind of like what Hillary has, I think, where they get fat feet.  And the ankle goes right, the foot goes right into the calf?  Yeah, it's where, like, water collects, she's like, yeah, water collects, I gotta get that 
[03:21:30]  fixed.  So, my fucking, before I leave, it's a disaster.  I get here, the apartment is roach infested, I got roaches in my apartment.  Now, this is the apartment that you've rented for how long?  It's five months.  Five months, you went, you looked at it, I remember you were very excited about it in  Hollywood.  But I didn't look, my managers looked at this one, because the one we wanted to look at  was too much money, they, they, they lied about the price, it was too much money.  So this one, um, we accepted, and I kind of signed for it without seeing, and it was 
[03:22:00]  fine, and I come back, I got pictures, I got video, there's fucking roaches, it was  infested with cockroaches.  They were in the bedroom with the lights on, I had to leave.  Holy shit, get out of here.  Are you kidding?  Dude, everything is booked in LA, because the stupid Microsoft convention, and the, uh,  uh, the Emmys coming up, so every hotel is booked.  I had to go into Beverly Hills, my manager got me a deal on a hotel for two nights, I  have nowhere to stay out here, so I have nowhere to stay in LA.  Homeless little Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm sure I won't be homeless, but just, so far the trip has been an abortion, and 
[03:22:30]  I haven't even gone to the studio yet.  And what are you going to do, uh, about living arrangements, though?  I don't know.  You got two days.  What's that?  You got two days.  Dude, I know you're going to go to Stupid's Wedding in fucking Edmonton.  Rich Foss's Wedding.  Yeah.  And I'm flying Northwest, which is declaring bankruptcy, and I've had a maintenance strike  for a month.  I'm never coming back.  Now, let me tell you, this is coming from Jimmy Norton, who only flies Continental because,  as he's told everybody, youngest fleet, they are not in bankruptcy. 
[03:23:00]  Yep.  They do very well, and, uh, he's very confident with flying that airline.  Only one of two airlines, not in bankruptcy, right?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Actually, Jim, they laid off 3,000, uh, mechanics, and they replaced them with 1,000.  Who did?  Uh, Northwest.  Northwest.  Oh, okay.  That's, that's, that's comforting.  At least they, you know, they only cut their mechanic, uh, force, by, by two-thirds.  That's fine.  That's acceptable.  They just got three times the work, man.  Three times the work, and they're going to go in with a smile and make sure everything's  taken care of.  Of course, because none of their friends got fired, you know. 
[03:23:30]  Oh.  I'm sure they'll still do their jobs.  Look, my options were either that or Alaska Air, which I won't fly.  Oh, boy.  Because they have that fucking, it looks like Steve C. on the side of the plane.  Yeah, it's a big, it's Steve on the tail.  Yeah, that big, you know, the cockpit recording goes, wind shear, wind shear.  Pull up, pull up, pull up.  So I'm not flying, uh, them, and the other one was an Air Canada flight connecting with  United, so I just decided to go with Northwest, because I hate United. 
[03:24:00]  So we'll see how that goes.  But, uh, Northwest.  It's been a nightmare.  I wasn't going to call until next week.  I'm like, I want to go to the wedding first, you know, I'll call next week.  Right.  It's just been a disaster so far.  Well, did you bang that chick back here in New York?  No, I could do it.  I lost my rod.  And she was kind of turning me on when she was rubbing her breasts on my mule.  It was kind of nice, because the guy told me, yeah, she's dirty, she'll do anything.  But then she wouldn't, she wouldn't do anything without a bag.  Um, I asked her if she'd just, like, lick my balls a little.  She wouldn't even lick my balls.  She's like, no, I don't do that. 
[03:24:30]  Well, I don't do that.  She's a whore.  Well, yeah, I should have pointed that out to her, but I'd already paid my money.  It was just, it was, it was just a waste.  And I just wanted to get out of there.  She was fat, and she had a fake blonde wig on.  It was just horrendous.  I think she did, like, the top ten things to make a man lose his fucking heart on me.  Yeah, yeah.  My back smells like Ben Gay.  Because my breasts are too heavy.  I have legadermia.  Legadermia, and I won't lick your balls.  You're becoming a huge star, and this is what's happening to you.  Dude, I'm a fucking, I'm a train wreck of a human being. 
[03:25:00]  It's just the reality.  It's like, the flight was great, too.  Coming out was great.  I haven't slept since yesterday.  I haven't slept enough since I flew.  I'm like, the flight was good.  Everything was great.  No turbulence.  I'm like, this is going way too well.  The rental car, it's a brand new rental car.  57 miles on it.  I'm like, this is just, something's going to go wrong.  You know what, also?  It's Jimmy's, like, he's going out there.  He's going to be in a series.  It's like a dream come true, and you probably have all these images in your head of what 
[03:25:30]  it's supposed to be like, and then you get out there, and it just starts falling apart  with a roach-infested apartment.  He sounds like Jewel when she first got there, sleeping in her car.  It's like, dude, you booked a show.  It's not supposed to work out that way.  Dude, this is how you know you're infested with roaches.  Like, when I turned the light on and I saw one on the door, that's bad, because there's  no food source on the door, but I, like, all right, no crumbs are on the door.  But when you have the lights on for 20 minutes and you turn the air conditioner on and you 
[03:26:00]  still see them walking across the floor, that's a problem.  When I opened the cabinet, there was one in the cabinet.  Is the place dirty?  Is it like?  It's an older building, and again, it's expensive by most standards, but because it's a furnished  apartment and you're in L.A., there's not much you can do.  You just got to turn the lights on, get in the middle of the room and go, I'm a fancy  man.  They understood that.  It's like they were mocking the fancy man before then.  Dude, it was awful. 
[03:26:30]  I know this woman's not going to want to give me my money back.  It's going to be a problem.  So I paid, like, one month and then a month's deposit, so I know I'm going to get fucked  for that money.  This is just turning it to be an awful trip.  I'm hoping.  The script is very funny.  I saw the script.  That's the only good thing.  Are you, uh, do you have video of these cockroaches?  Yeah, I did it with my camera because I know this bitch is not going to want to give  my money back, so I took photographs, horrible photographs of the little fellas, and I have  a video of, like, three of them on my camera.  Like, just shit video, but I have that, and I have one in the bedroom on the rug.  I mean, when you see cockroaches in a bedroom that's got the lights on on the rug, you're 
[03:27:00]  completely infested.  Uh-huh, absolutely.  Because I was going to stay for the night.  I'm like, maybe they're just in the kitchen.  Oh, dude, they'd be crawling on you.  Yeah, I know.  Or they'd be on the wall.  Crawling in and out of your mouth, seeing if there's food in there.  It was all a furnished apartment?  Yeah, which I don't like the idea up to begin with.  Oh, what about the bed?  Did you look at the mattress?  No, it was okay.  It looked like it was a decent bed.  I didn't even lay in it, though.  Did you, did you, were sheets on it, or?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, did you look underneath and look what the mattress looks like?  No, I didn't get that.  Dude, you got all these sands and roaches and, ugh.  Well, I should have known better when, like, I was told there was, like, a fast, like,  an internet connection, and I get there, and I go to her house to sign the paperwork,  and she hands me a box and says, here's your DSL.  So I had to fucking hook my own DSL up, and of course it didn't work.  I called the DSL people.  They say this phone number's registered to somebody at a different address.  It was just the whole thing.  Ah, clusterfuck, yeah.  I would love to hear the audio of him doing that. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because.  Tourette's.  Yeah, why are you so calm right now, Jimmy?  Because.  We know you.  He's exhausted.  And then to top it off, I have fucking Fat Bob calling me to tell me that it was nothing  but chicks who wanted to put their pussies on a face, anyone's face.  I didn't want to, I didn't even want to tell you about this yesterday.  I heard about it, Bobby told me, and I heard part of the replay in the car.  It's the first time since we've been on the air that we had the type of action in this  studio that we got yesterday.  We weren't able, whenever Jimmy's here and girls come in, we are barely able to get them 
[03:28:30]  to get down to a bra and panties, never mind wowing or taking their pants off, nothing.  We get nothing from girls that come in here.  Yesterday, Jimmy's gone one day.  We get three girls, more that were in here, there were like five girls, but three of the  girls, all the girls got naked.  Three of them decide they want to try the wiffle ball bat challenge and take the wiffle  ball bat comes down the first time in a year and they lube it up and one by one, there 
[03:29:00]  they go, shoving it right in them.  Five girls completely naked in the studio for, I don't know, close to an hour.  Then a lesbian show that was just box eating at its best.  Bob Kelly is just sitting on a chair with one of these chicks on his lap, massaging  her tits.  It's just, it's just, and that would have been Jimmy.  Yeah, that's great, but instead I'm doing a great impression of a Puerto Rican in Los  Angeles.  Oh, you poor son of a bitch.  Dude, it's just, it really is awful.  What was the name of that escort service that you got the Bengay waterlogged woman from? 
[03:29:30]  It wasn't a service, it was this guy I talked to online, who's actually a cool guy who I  like, but he recommended this one to me.  He's like, yeah, she's cool, she had a big clit.  And she did have a big clit.  Maybe it was like a bait and switch thing that was happening.  No, because I've seen a picture of her before, it was her, but the way she took the photo,  she kind of like was laying out with like a long flowing thing, so you can't see what  a fatso she is.  She kind of hid it really well.  You know, but I can't blame her for that. 
[03:30:00]  I kind of knew she was going to be a fucking blimp and I still went.  I just didn't realize how fat she'd be.  That's like on MySpace.  Whatever photo they use, everybody looks good looking.  So what you do is you click on more photos and then you see like...  Then you got to see the real deal because they're going to put the best photo possible.  Yeah, because if you're ugly, you got one good one.  One good one in you.  Yeah, of course.  Everyone has one in them.  Poor Jimmy.  He's like the young girl from the...  that goes out to L.A. to go in movies.  And she gets there and like is met by a pimp at the bus and she's just getting fucked in 
[03:30:30]  the ass a week later.  Yeah, that pretty much is what it's like.  I had stars in my eyes.  Yeah.  It's just...  Got off the Greyhound.  Yeah.  Gets off the Greyhound bus.  He's walking down Hollywood Boulevard looking at the stars on the sidewalk.  Hollywood.  It's an awful montage.  Yeah, I can see the montage.  I see the montage in my head.  And there he is in his cockroach infested apartment, Jim, looking up at the Hollywood sign.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I made it.  Looking at the billboards. 
[03:31:00]  Right at the end of the song, some homeless guy says something a little mean to foreshadow  the roaches and shit that he's going to see in the next hour.  He looks up at one of the many billboards in Los Angeles and you see his face get superimposed  on someone's face up there.  It's all excited.  Hey, Jimmy, you missed Harry Reams yesterday.  Yeah, I know.  Yoshi told me, so it was good.  I missed the chicks fucking each other with cucumbers and I missed a porn legend while I  was running around stepping on roaches with my fucking fat right boot.  That guy had a hell of a story to tell yesterday. 
[03:31:30]  Is he doing real estate in Utah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a real estate agent.  Imagine buying your house from Harry Reams.  Yeah.  You can see it in his eyes.  He's barely holding on.  He's been clean and sober 16 years.  He's married.  We could have knocked him off that wagon so quickly.  Yeah.  What do you think of the chicks?  He was the one that got him naked.  We thought the girls were just going to hand out wow stickers and they weren't up for anything.  The second they walked in, he's like, let me see something.  Let me see a little.  He turned in a second.  And one of the girls flashed, she was wearing a skirt with no panties and pulled her skirt 
[03:32:00]  up and flashed the vag right at him.  And he goes, oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  We could have had him drinking.  Easily.  Back in porno.  His mustache was growing back.  That big 70s porno stash.  Yeah.  He was definitely barely holding on.  Did she have a nice one?  A nice meaty one?  All of them had nice meaty vages.  Of course they did.  You loved it.  Of course they did.  They all had fine parts, Jimmy.  One girl, she was Korean and Jewish.  That's right.  And she got up on the console and put her ankles behind her head. 
[03:32:30]  And it just, it looked like an explosion at the Steakums factory.  God damn it.  God damn it.  Yeah.  The one day I'm not there.  The first day.  First day.  I fucking leave.  That's what we were saying.  I wouldn't do that shit karma.  Jimmy, one of the girls had a nickname.  What was it?  Cock Hog.  Yeah.  She self-proclaimed herself cock hog.  She goes, yeah, that's why I'm a cock hog. 
[03:33:00]  Dude, you aren't in here when cock hog is.  That's even disgusting for a porn star.  Yeah.  You were taking pictures of cockroaches and we were hanging out with cock hog.  Yeah.  I'm a cockroach hog and you got cock hog.  Cock hog.  Yeah, so.  So, um.  So we miss you, Jimmy.  Well, you can rest assured I miss you too.  You understand, I haven't even done a table read and I really do want to just leave.  I'm like, I can't.  Oh, no.  And I'm looking forward to doing this, but just the fact that that stupid asshole has to get married in northern Canada. 
[03:33:30]  What?  Because he's pussy whipped.  Why would you do that?  You don't.  Why would you drag your friend up there?  You don't.  It's inconveniencing your friend and loved ones.  I really wish I had something else to do so I could just say, no, I can't.  Well, you got to get married where the girl lives, though.  Yeah, I know, man.  That's the deal.  What's that's the deal?  That's the deal.  That's not the deal.  That's the deal most of the time.  It's the United States of America.  That's where you get married and divorced.  How many of them? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, someplace cool like Italy.  Yeah, if you're going to go somewhere else, you don't go to Canada.  Is that even legal down here?  Is he really married if you get married in Canada?  I don't know if it holds up.  Don't you have to be married in the United States?  That's a good question.  Of course it is.  Smelling horses.  All right, Jimmy, it sounds like you're off to a great start there in Hollywood.  Yeah, man, I got to sleep because I got to go to wardrobe tomorrow.  Ask for the ring and a hockey player slap shoots it up the aisle.  Stupid Canada.  Stupid Canada.  Well, we look forward to the stories from Rich Voss' wedding. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, I'm sure it'll be good.  I'm going to try to tape some of it if I can.  Oh, the toast if you can, please.  Are you going to send the pictures of the cockroaches in so we can all check it out?  Well, yeah, I didn't have a connection.  I should get that in for you sometime later today, but I got to shower now and go to bed and get up by like 12.  Is it true that when they want the couple to kiss at Voss' wedding, everybody walks up to Rich with their fork and taps on his teeth?  All right, with that, Jim, we'll let you be. 
[03:35:00]  All right, Jimmy, please take care of yourself out there.  Well, you know what it is?  I think that they were telling him that they had to get me out of here.  Yeah, well, you know, Ben ran in and he said, you know, we got to move on.  We got other things to do today.  All right, guys.  Yeah, we got to let you go.  We got to let you go, Jimmy.  You should let me be.  All right, Billy, have a good call.  Unless you want to talk to, wait, we got Steve from Yellowstone on the phone if you want to.  Ramone, bring me a Spix resident. 
[03:35:30]  All right, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy, take care, man.  All right, later.  All right.  Oh, I feel bad for him.  He's out there taping the HBO show there.  He had everything but the Scientology story.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's coming.  I'm sure that's coming.  You know what it is?  He's such a pervert, and he can be such a prick, but alone out there, he's such a vulnerable  little guy.  He sounded like Woody Allen.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do.  He is like Woody Allen. 
[03:36:00]  He doesn't know what to do.  Cockroach infested.  He should.  And you know something?  Jimmy knows better.  I don't know how the hell he rented a place without looking at it, knowing Jimmy.  He doesn't do that stuff.  Well, he does things last minute, though.  So he had no choice in the matter.  I was excited.  It was part of the montage.  Yeah, part of the montage.  Oh, the poor bastard.  Hand him the keys, shaking the hand, thumbs up.  Yeah, thumbs up.  Gleaming his eyes.

[03:39:30]  Banana four.  Bob Kelly in the studio.  Yes.  A few things to get to before we get out of here for today.  Lady Di back on the phone.  Oh, hold on.  Before we go to the phone, I have to do something here.  Hold on a minute.  Jump in front of a train?  Oh, here we go with the banana phone. 
[03:40:00]  Didn't you get your banana phone turned off for not paying the bill?  No, I did not get my banana phone turned off for not paying the bill.  I paid the bill.  Way to improv.  Just repeat the joke.  Stupid.  But Lady Di, here's the new bit with you, okay?  We're going to start the train sound effect.  We're going to give you, I don't know, less than a minute to say something that is worth 
[03:40:30]  listening to if you're paying for this stupid radio program, okay?  Okay.  So, here comes the train.  All right, here comes the train.  Say whatever you want.  I love you guys, and I will love you for a long time.  There.  Here comes the train.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Oh.  Here we go.  Bye, guys.  We'll talk to you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh.  There's another loved one. 
[03:41:00]  Oops.  She's got nothing.  Oh.  It would sound like that if a train hit her.  Oh, big wreck.  Ugh.  She had nothing.  I've actually done girls bigger than her.  Oh, yeah.  Bob Kelly's taking a look at her.  Really?  I swear to God.  I actually did a girl so big, I was on top of her in the bed, and both my knees didn't  touch the bed. 
[03:41:30]  It was like fucking an upside-down canoe.  It was, I was in Houston, it was a black chick, and it was, I had to stay an extra  night, and I went to the movies with all these black girls in Houston.  It was, it was crazy, and this one big black chick.  How did you hook up with them?  Well, they were just taking me out.  I was there with Tracy Morgan, and I had to stay an extra night because of the flight,  so the next day they took me to a barbecue church, and it was all this southern stuff  and taking me out of the black parts of town. 
[03:42:00]  How did you know they wanted to take you out?  Did they call you?  Yeah, they called me up.  Okay.  And then I went to the movies, and this chick had a sundress on.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Don't you dare.  And she, she called me up on the phone, she goes, what'd you?  Called you on the phone?  Yeah, my room.  She goes, what'd you do?  And then she started singing this song.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  She sang that song. 
[03:42:30]  That's how I got her back to the room.  I had a banana phone.  All right, so she calls you up once you go to the movies.  So I got this, she called me on the phone, she goes, would you?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  So she, what? 
[03:43:00]  I see your finger on the button, you fucking twat.  All right, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Break your little thin Cassidy fingers.  I'll kick your dog.  She just called me up, she goes.  Sorry, I'm coming.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Can you please get through the story when we're running out of show?  I'll be, I'd rather take poker chips to the face than this goddamn song. 
[03:43:30]  All right, go ahead.  So she just called me up.  Oh, no.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  And she said, what you doing?  She goes, she goes, this is what she said, what you doing?  I swear to God, she goes, what you doing? 
[03:44:00]  I said, nothing.  She goes, you want me to come over?  I went, sure.  Two seconds later, I was knocking on my door.  She called me from her cell phone.  Outside the door.  I had a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos in my room.  She walks in, sits down, grabs the Cool Ranch.  Yeah.  Starts eating them.  I'm just lying there petrified.  And I had those pull-away sweatpants.  Yeah.  So she basically started grabbing my conch with one hand,  eating Doritos with the other.  I got a hard-on. 
[03:44:30]  I'm just lying there still as a, just lying there, not moving.  Then she just grabs my sweatpants and rips them off like a silverback gorilla.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  She, Bob.  All right, whatever.  You got to put some emphasis into the story.  You're starting to phone it in.  So.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  I don't know, all these dink villages sound the same to me. 
[03:45:00]  That sounds like that.  My foot can't, it won't stop tapping.  So she's eating Doritos.  I really, I'm going to let you kick my dog.  So she just, I just got on top of her and I almost fell off.  How much do you think she weighed?  She probably weighed over three.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I was in Houston. 
[03:45:30]  It was Houston on a Saturday stay over.  It's not like you're on Mars with a lighter.  What are you going to do?  You're in Houston.  So it's 300 pounds?  Her tit was so big I had to hold it with two hands.  And I actually, this is the only time in my life she was blowing me and I actually stopped her.  I went, I can't do this.  I actually got morals.  Shoot up Doritos scraping you.  It was just the size of her areola was the size of my head.  Did you have to take your two hands to make it look like a boob? 
[03:46:00]  Just leave a little poke out the thumb in the other fingers.  They're so flat that you got to shape your own boob for yourself.  It was huge.  That's my arm.  Wow, that was just a great story.  Thanks.  Oh, Jesus.  That was really good.  What are you going to do?  I've been with a lot of fat girls in my life.  Yes.  We got the Paralyzed song that we promised.  Oh, goody.  I don't know what this is.  It's a parody of Three Doors Down, Kryptonite.  We were talking about song parodies and how this to me is a brilliantly written one.  I just don't know how clear the audio is, but I listen to this. 
[03:46:30]  I just love the way this is written.  It stays true to the song.  Is it really like offensive and bad?  No, it's just so well.  It's clean and it's so well.  It's everything a song parody should be.  But it's about Christopher Reeve?  Yeah.  Oh, then it's got to be really offensive.  It's not pleasant.  There's an audience.  I hope that's not the vocals. 
[03:47:00]  I hope that's not the job unless I wore a blue and red suit.  I think there's nothing I can do.  Yeah.  You know what I'm doing with this?  Yeah.  There you go.  I hope that's not the song. 
[03:47:30]  Now I can't feel my legs or my arms.  If I'm going to lock my horse for Houston County Superman,  I'm going to go to pray and I'm never going to walk again.  The only things I move are my lips and eyes because I'm paralyzed. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, that is horrid.  It's well written.  It's a great parody.  I just wish the audio was clearer.  That's pretty funny.  Someone will find that for us.  Yeah, please do.  I think the guy's name is Eric Snyder or something.  I really want that whole song.  I'd fall off my horse.  Would you still call me Superman?  Dude, I broke two vertebrae.  I'm never going to walk again.  That's just great.  That's just great.  What a sicko.  But that's what a song parody can be vicious as long as it's well written.  All right.  Poor Todd Lynn.  Then we got audio of Hilary Swank talking about how she took a CPR class. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  And then what?  Why is that good?  She's bragging about how she had this dream that she was meant to save somebody's life,  so she took a CPR class so that it would happen, and then she went to do CPR and it didn't work.  Eric, can you take your hand off my hand off your mule?  Thanks.  What were you buddy here?  I had my hand on the chair, and he just put his cock right against it and was talking to the microphone.  He was just...  Well, good move to patiently tell him instead of just moving your hand away.  I was taught in an emergency to relax and stay calm and rub a guy's mule if you have to. 
[03:49:00]  Would you please rock back and forth until...  Bob knows that Eric is known to talk a lot, so he figured he would just enjoy himself.  Yeah, just feel his banana phone for a little while.  I was dreaming a lot that I was going to have to save someone's life.  And I thought, I'm not going to ignore this dream anymore.  And I got certified in CPR, and I'd say three months after that, someone collapsed in an airport. 
[03:49:30]  He had had a heart attack and wasn't getting... he was dying.  So I just administered CPR until the paramedics could get there.  We didn't live.  I mean, I got his heart going, and I mean, I kept...  I didn't get his heart going, but I acted as his heart.  Pumping his chest.  Maybe you should stop dreaming, you bitch. 
[03:50:00]  Jesus.  Oh, maybe you should just get on your plane.  Right.  Just walk.  Get on your plane.  Get on your plane at Cheaterboro and hit a building, you melodramatic whore.  Shut up.  Jesus.  That's pretty epic funny.  That's what you want when you're going out, is to look up and think, oh, great, Hillary Swank's got to save my life.  Yeah, next time, take a sleeping pill and leave the saving dollars.  Great.  Jesus.  I didn't live.  Yeah, maybe there was somebody that was more capable that looked and went, well, she seems to have things in hand. 
[03:50:30]  It's Hillary Swank.  Look.  Boys don't cry.  Apparently, they don't know CPR either, do they, stupid ass?  Oh, I tried CPR, but I didn't notice he was choking.  Oh, we don't have time to play this.  The hooker's getting caught.  We'll have to save for tomorrow.  Ooh.  Can I just say that I really stunk today, but it's not my fault.  I like your story.  Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  I thought I was coming in here to talk about the midgets. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, right.  We have midget audio that we haven't gone to for a while.  Yeah, we haven't gotten to that.  Remember that midget thing?  Right.  Right?  Midget special.  Now you remind us?  Well, it's your show.  Dude, we're stupid.  You should have sat out there and told someone.  That's the reason you were here.  I thought you were here to tell that stupid five-minute story.  We get you in, you tell your story, and you get out of here.  No.  I didn't know I was telling a story.  Then I was all pressured, and I'm coming up with all my, I banged a fat chick.  Honestly, I was confused when Ben called me.  He's like, Bob Kelly's coming in tomorrow. 
[03:51:30]  I'm like, for what?  Then I'm thinking, well, there was that funny story at the Brooklyn Diner.  Oh, all right.  I forgot it was about the midgets, so now you have to come back.  The midgets.  You want to come back?  No.  No, no.  You know what I want to do?  This is what I want.  This is what I like.  There's things I want to do, too, but you're not going to let me kick your dog.  Hang on one second.  Go ahead.  Just call me when you want to call me.  I don't like this pressure shit where you brought me in.  You got a phone?  I got a phone.  I got a phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[03:52:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Opie and his goddamn finger.  He's a son of a bitch.  How do you get to it so quick?  I really did forget that you were coming in here to talk about the midget stuff.  I really did, so I apologize.  It's all right.  So when do you want to come back?  No, you know what?  No, L.P., because you have that little Satan.  L.P.?  L.P.?  What's it?  L.P.?  That was Anthony and Opie.  I both of them together.  It's L.P.  L.P.  L.P.  L.P. Summers.  When it comes to fruition, just let me come back. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  All right.  L.P.  I'll come back whenever I get a call.  You know, I'm right down the street.  You just call me in when there's nothing going on.

At the recent CBIT Expo in Germany, I got to check out new devices coming out in the  next year.  Digital camera phones have finally hit the 3.2 megapixel mark with Sony's Cybershot 
[03:53:30]  handset.  Ringtones make room for vibe tones.  The ringtones that vibrate can be assigned to specific people so your phone has a  different vibration for each person.  Every new MP3 player coming out has a screen for video entertainment, some so small you  wonder who's going to watch a TV show on a one-inch screen.  There's a new version of the MP3 that's surround sound.  The car demo that I set in was stunning.  One project on display here showed how a computer can write your blog for you if your day is too 
[03:54:00]  hectic.  Robotic bartenders showed off the future of outsourcing, and in the bird flu hysteria,  one booth had germ-free CDs.

[03:59:00]  Baseball has been our family's life.  We grew up in the game from the very start.  I had the unique opportunity to watch my father work in the game as a child.  Dad was very passionate about the game.  His mood and demeanor would change the moment he put his uniform on.  No matter how he felt, he was instantly energized when he put on his work clothes.  Dad always called his uniform his work clothes.  His love and passion for the game was passed on to me.  When Billy and I came to the Big Leagues, Dad was our manager.  We were the double play combination in Baltimore. 
[03:59:30]  Being reunited with Dad in the majors filled the gaps when he was gone so much. </pre>
