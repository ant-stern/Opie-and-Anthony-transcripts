<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous conversation featuring crude banter and offensive language.  The hosts engaged in discussions of pornography and drug and alcohol use, fueled by a call from Sean and Dennis in Washington who were participating in their drinking game, detailing their intoxicated state and the game's rules, including explicit descriptions of their drinking habits. Sean also described his job at a dating service connecting older women with younger men.  The conversation then shifted to O.J. Simpson, focusing on a recent altercation with his girlfriend. Studio guests Earl (possibly “Black Earl”) and Vinny joined the hosts, contributing jokes and commentary, often employing racist and offensive language, and discussing the possibility of Simpson appearing on an XFL pregame show.  Several Arnold Schwarzenegger prank calls were played, featuring the actor's voice used to prank various businesses with lines like "I'm a cop, you idiot" and "Stop whining."  The show received a call from Mark, claiming suicidal ideation after consuming alcohol and muscle relaxers.  The hosts, initially skeptical, offered him Tool concert tickets in exchange for verifying his location and condition, involving listeners in an attempt to locate him.

The next segment detailed the aftermath of Mark's call.  Listeners raced to the corner of Black Horse Pike and Narbeth Avenue in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, to find Mark.  A confusing scene ensued with multiple people arriving, including Dan, who initially located Mark. The police were called, and Mark was taken away in an ambulance, handcuffed.  The ambiguity surrounding Mark’s situation left uncertainty about the genuineness of his distress. The show then transitioned to a comedic reenactment of a New York Post article about Star Jones’s Hamptons barbecue, focusing on her alleged diva-like behavior and preferential treatment.

Comedian Carlos Mencia then joined the show.  He shared anecdotes about his career, navigating racial humor, and the challenges of performing jokes that touched upon ethnicity and sensitive topics.  He discussed censorship, audience reactions, and his observations on racial dynamics and political correctness. He recounted jokes about drug use in different communities, and shared humorous stories about his family, including his father's explanation for having 18 children ("Your mother just doesn't like to suck") and his mother's indifferent reaction to his near-death experience. He also talked about his confrontational approach to perceived injustices, using examples like demanding his fries and breaking a car window to help someone retrieve their keys.

Further guests were introduced: Angel, a Puerto Rican man recently released from jail; Jamaica Mike, a Jamaican man; and Old Dirty, a Dominican man.  A highly charged and profane discussion ensued about ethnicity, American politics, social programs (including a detailed explanation of the “Family First Card”), and the men's experiences with law enforcement. The conversation was punctuated by interruptions, jokes, and insults targeting various ethnic groups.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a recent Seattle earthquake and news footage of the event.

The final segment focused on a caller, Earl, who predicted a major earthquake that would destroy or cause the West Coast to "drift away."  The hosts and other callers engaged in absurd speculation, including jokes about building bridges, using Mexicans as human anchors, and other landmasses drifting. The conversation was peppered with vulgar language and racial slurs and included anecdotes from callers about their experiences with earthquakes.  The hosts played songs, referencing Dobie Gray's "Drift Away."  The discussion touched on geographical concepts, albeit in a largely comedic and inaccurate manner. The segment ended with a call about digging to China and more outlandish hypotheticals before a commercial break.

Maybe these guys need to hear the public service announcement?  Yes.  Hold on.  I got to play this for you.  Marijuana is a narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Still Friday, man.  Yeah, it hurt my school career.  Hold on, wait.  Ready?  I got one for you.  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Another Milwaukee's best kid in open, right?

I quit because I couldn't listen to two hours of your show.  Well, what did you do at this dating service?  I talked old divorced women into, like, getting it on with young men.  Hey, rock on.  Right?  That's not a bad business.  It was a bug out.  And what did your friend do?  I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  I don't think he does anything, man.  Doesn't even know.  Don't you guys, like, kind of room together?  Yeah, he lives upstairs, man.  Oh, yeah?  Hey, what do you do, dude?  Nothing.  Oh, yeah, he doesn't have a job either, man.  He got fired.  Nothing.  All right.  These guys are exactly like I was.  I swear to God.  This is how I spent my whole 20s.  It's good times, man.  Every day when I was in my 20s was spent just like this.  This is reminding me of those years in the fraternity house in Geneseo.  Hanging out doing nothing at the Phi Sig house. 
[00:08:30]  You guys rule.  Fred, boy.  You've been so many movies made about guys like this.  It's hysterical.  Hey, you guys got to send some pictures up to New York so we can put it on our website.  Yo, I got so many pictures of this kid passed out.  It was like all sorts of crap on him.  We had a friend named Dan.  Yeah.  He's in a band actually called Escoffleys.  Okay.  So if Dan's listening, hey. 
[00:09:00]  But no, he was passed out and Dan's like six, four, three hundred pounds.  Yeah.  And we just got a picture of Dan just squatting his ass over his passed out face.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Oh, hold on.  One more.  All right.  Oh, you got the part.  Our new friends.  We're going to have the hotline to be with the butthead, man. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, right on.  Where's your friend?  What's up?  Where's your friend?  Because he called me a pussy because I was in a frat.  Yeah, go pick up some marshmallows.  We heard about that.  Not every frat does the marshmallow trick, my friend.  We heard about that.  It does the marshmallows.  Not every fraternity does the marshmallow trick, my friend.  What is the marshmallow?  I'm not.  Explain.  Please explain.  I'm not talking.  I was going to tell your friend that I was in a cool frat.  Doesn't it wind up in an ass crack? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And you, yeah.  Yeah, I've heard some things, Anthony.  Yeah.  I just want to tell your friend that I was in a cool frat.  We had guys that, like, you know, they dropped acid and burned Bibles.  That's cool, right?  I guess.  Hey, stupid.  Come here.  Hey.  You call each other stupid?  Yeah.  What's his nickname?  He's got a bunch.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Dummy.  Drunkard.  Jackass.  Jackass.  Okay. 
[00:10:30]  Hold on.  All right.  Take the phone.  Hey, yo.  Hey, Sean.  Hey, stupid.  Yo, buddy.  What's up?  How's it hanging, man?  Hey, do you have anything you ever want to maybe do?  Um, not really.  I kind of would like to try, like, some new drugs or something.  There's no career or any job you might think would be cool to have?  I aspire to do, like, eight hits of medicine at once because that would just, you know?  But you really, there's no drive there or ambition to maybe do something? 
[00:11:00]  Nah, man.  I got a foosball table in my dining room.  All right.  Screw me.  Yeah, man.  I'm okay, dude.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Hey, we got a foosball table right outside the studio.  Yeah.  No.  How fun is that?  No, it's great.  You front or back on foosball?  No, I always take back, dude.  Yeah.  Oh, pardon.  I almost hurled on the phone.  You're back, man.  Hey, how did you find out about us? 
[00:11:30]  My friend who went up to school in, like, New York at Iona?  Yeah.  He said the show was pretty sweet, so I decided to tune in, man.  All right.  Cool.  And it beat, like, watching Sally Jesse or F.L. in training, you know?  Those teen boot camp things are pretty cool sometimes.  Those chicks are hot, man.  Aren't they?  Like, my 14-year-old daughter dresses too sexy.  Yeah, isn't that the best show?  I love that show, man.  And then, like, they come on, and they're dressed all hot, and they're flipping off the audience. 
[00:12:00]  And the audience is pissed.  I'd be up there clapping, going, yeah, you rule.  We're going to get along with you just fine.  And then they dress him up like a bunch of dorks at the end of the show.  They give him, like, a makeover or something, and they get him crying, and they put him  in these things like they're ready to go to work at IBM or something.  I like him in the slut outfit.  They give them one outfit to go back to their trailer with, man.  Yeah, they give him the one pantsuit, one smart little outfit.  It's like, oh, you'll be the talk of the double wide, I swear. 
[00:12:30]  For, like, a day, and then they're back to the little ass skirt.  Hey, I think we just found a new radio show for this nation.  Hell, yeah.  Yeah.  You guys want to do mornings?  Yeah, can we have a job, man?  I need a job where I can smoke dope and drink at, man.  Hey, you just found the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's pretty much what we do.  You should see our stairwell.  What a kisser these guys are, man.  Hey, I just wanted to ask you if this is cool, because I was in a fraternity, right?  And you made fun of me?  Yeah, I did. 
[00:13:00]  But we were in a cool fraternity.  Like, I had a guy that would drop acid and then burn Bibles in the middle of the street.  That's cool, right?  You ever use a Bible paper to roll a duver, man?  It's the perfect thing.  What's the best page?  No, you always use the back page, like, because it's blank or has a map on it or something.  A map or something.  So it's not like you're, you know, dissing God or anything.  Right, you're not desecrating a Bible.  It's just the page with the credits.  Yeah.  You guys are rocking it.  The credits. 
[00:13:30]  You don't want to, like, smoke it on a picture of Jesus from a picture Bible, either.  Jesus has a website, you know.  Swear to you.  There's some guy out there that says he's, he looks just like Jesus.  He dresses like Jesus.  He's got Jesus.com.  And what he does, he gets chicks to bathe with him.  It says, like, a bathe with the Messiah thing.  And he gets naked with these girls in a bathtub.  What a gimmick.  Imagine you could turn water into wine, dude.  You'd be the hit of the party, man. 
[00:14:00]  That'd be the greatest.  Jesus rules.  I do need a beer run.  Now, don't worry, man.  I'll just turn some water into wine.  It'll be crazy.  Hey, I have a feeling you guys are going to be stars on our radio show, man.  Yeah.  Yesterday morning, we woke up, like, all drunk and, like, no, we didn't go to sleep.  It was, like, 7 in the morning.  Yeah.  We had nothing to do, so we went to church.  Yeah.  Because it's, like, a big sing-along and we get some free food and stuff.  It was crazy. 
[00:14:30]  A big sing-along.  Yeah, it's fun, right?  Yeah.  It's family, sure.  Hey, where's that pot zone?  We've got to play it.  Oh, no, wait.  Should I smoke some more pot for this, man?  I'm getting, like, a contact high talking to these guys.  It's great, man.  All right, we've got a song to play for you guys.  Which one is it?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What are you doing?  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, we're going to play some.  You guys have heard of the Afro Man, right?  Who?  Afro Man.  Who's that?  Oh, it's a great pot song. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  It's being played everywhere, my friend.  Well, why don't you play it, then?  It's from Gay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to see that movie.  It looks pretty sweet, dude.  The gays hate it, so it's got to be good.  It's frigging gays, man.  Oh, my God.  You're not too sympathetic to the gay community?  If you like man ass, stop complaining.  I mean, what's worse than stinky man ass? 
[00:15:30]  Don't complain about anything at that point.  As a man, you know, yeah, I think that's, you know,  stinky man ass is kind of a bad thing, right?  But, you know, if they're into it, what the hell?  Yeah, you know, go ahead, man.  Who cares, you know?  A man ass is like their bong.  Dude, man.  Holy ass.  If it wasn't for the change in the couch,  you might be out there. 
[00:16:00]  Hey, what's your favorite movie?  Me?  Yeah.  Fast Times?  Oh.  How are you?  Yo, what are you bringing?  Two boards, many cases.  And the weed.  How old are you guys?  I'm 21.  We're both 21.  Woo-hoo!  We can go to the bars.  It's nice to know that Fast Times is still a hot movie.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  Fast Times rules.  I remember one morning, I was like 6 in the morning,  I'm all tripped out on the A-side, man. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And it came on, and it was like divine inspiration, man.  God sent it to me.  Jeff's like, here's Fast Times because you're tripping out.  All right, hold on now.  Hold on.  We're going to play this song for you.  You'll hear it on the radio, okay?  Excellent.  All right, here's the song for our new stoner friends in Virginia.  It's like, I don't care about nothing, man.  Roll another blunt.

[00:21:30]  That's what I said.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  So all of you skins.  Skins?  Please give me more.  I broke the phone.  M-A-E.  M-A-E.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh.  Uh.  A-E-I-O.  A-E.  Let's rock.  You guys are able. 
[00:22:00]  You sound like a fruity stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  Oh, my God.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Only on.  Ninety-four.  Ninety-four.  W-Y-S-P.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Come on, get down with the sickness. 
[00:22:30]  Don't be in your head.  You want to talk about O.J.?  The O.J.?  The O.J.?  The O.J., back to the news.  I wonder what this story's about. 
[00:23:00]  Did he do something good for society?  Hmm.  Did O.J. discover a cure for AIDS?  No.  Did he find the killers?  Maybe he found the killers.  No.  Nope, nope, nope.  Oh, I know what it was.  O.J. contributed a lot of money to a charity.  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  He had another fight with his girlfriend that looks just like Nicole Brown Simpson, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, all of his chicks look like that.  He likes the white chicks with the blonde hair.  Well, this is the same girl he's been going out with, Krisky Prade. 
[00:23:30]  On again, off again.  Relationship.  And just a little background.  Here are some related articles.  You might remember some of these O.J.'s greatest hits.  Of course, killing two people.  Then we have cocaine-fueled O.J. road rage attack.  I love that one.  O.J. in road rage incident.  O.J.'s ex says he broke into her home.  And a girlfriend gives O.J. the boot.  Some of the past things.  Always a problem with the girlfriend. 
[00:24:00]  The latest one, police were called to the South Florida home of O.J. Simpson's girlfriend.  Tuesday night after a neighbor reported hearing an altercation breakout between the two.  And O.J. gone by the time the cops showed up.  And Krisky Prade explained that her off-again, on-again boyfriend was angry with her for coming home late.  Well, there's a good reason, right?  According to police reports, she agreed to stay at a friend's house for the evening.  Don't go home.  We've seen what happens when you try to go home. 
[00:24:30]  The latest incident, of course, not the first altercation.  They don't even put in the history.  O.J. Simpson, as you might remember, was acquitted for killing.  Because we all know that.  That's a given now.  Yeah, finally we all know.  We got the police report, I think, in.  Yeah.  You want to hear that?  Yeah, this is the police reporting on what happened.  Nothing too thrilling.  Apparently what had occurred was a neighbor had heard some loud argument.  And because of that, the neighbor called the police.  There was no signs of any type of violence or any type of criminal act. 
[00:25:00]  Did you please?  Oh, Psycho Mark.  What the F?  What the hell is Psycho Mark doing?  My God.  I'm Big Dick Black.  No.  It's O.J.  The O.J.  I was in my rights.  She came home late.  I said 11.  It was 11.01.  And she walked in the door like it was 11.  I almost choked the bitch.  But I didn't. 
[00:25:30]  No, no, no.  I'm into stabbing the bitch.  The O.J.  This guy will not stay out of trouble.  And mark my words, it might take some time.  But he'll kill again.  It's like Frankenstein.  I mean, you know, you can put him in chains or whatever or bolt him to a wall, but he'll  get away and the villagers won't get him with the pitchforks.  Anthony, speaking of O.J.  Yeah.  When we were having those meetings with NBC about the XFL pregame show we're doing.  Yeah.  We suggested to NBC that they bring back O.J. 
[00:26:00]  O.J.  for the XFL on the sideline.  And the look we got from NBC Sports was quite frightening.  It was the butthead look where he just goes, ugh.  It was frightening.  Yeah.  And they talked about it because NBC used to have the NFL when O.J. was with them.  And they would talk about things that O.J. would do.  Like he always got everything wrong.  Beforehand, before the program, they would get everybody's picks, who they thought was  going to win the certain games around the country.  And O.J. would give his picks. 
[00:26:30]  Like he'd phone them in and say, yeah, I'm looking at the Rams over the Dolphins.  And they'd be like, oh, OK.  So they'd write it down, make a graphic of it.  So when the live broadcast happened on Sunday, they'd go to the various sportscasters and  get their picks.  And then they'd get to O.J.  And they'd have all his picks on the screen, and all he had to do was kind of read along,  I guess.  So it's like, O.J., why don't you give us your picks?  So they'd flash the graphics, Rams over the Dolphins, and he goes, I like the Redskins.  And he would screw the whole thing up. 
[00:27:00]  So they'd be like, oh, take the graphics down.  And we look like an idiot again.  He'd change it every time.  I forgot, standing on the sideline with my Bruno Mali shoes and my gloves.  Hey, Vinny wants in on this one, Ed.  Uh-oh.  Vinny!  Vinny the racist, of course.  Anthony, what, are you surprised that this happened?  I mean, here's a guy that was convicted of double murder, basically.  I mean, he cut his wife's head off.  Well, he was not convicted.  The second time?  Oh, in the civil suit.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  I mean, come on.  This guy lied and said that the pictures that they took weren't of him. 
[00:27:30]  And then all of a sudden, they find out that I think like six pair of Bruno Mali shoes were  sold in the whole damn country.  And one of them was him that bought a pair.  And actually, it was his wife that bought the pair.  Not only that, I mean, come on.  The guy, what a coincidence.  He cut his thumb the same day that his wife had her head cut off.  Vinny, Vinny.  Come on.  Vinny, I think at this point, even the black people think that O.J. did it.  Vinny.  You know something, Opie?  You're right.  Except we do have one person in the studio that is still convinced O.J. is innocent. 
[00:28:00]  I never said he was innocent.  He was never convicted.  Oh, come on, Joe.  No, that's Black Earl.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's Earl.  That's Earl.  Joe, I'm sorry.  That's Earl.  I should have known.  Black Earl says he wasn't convicted, so you've got to give him the benefit of the doubt.  You should have got his job back, though.  Earl, the community, though, does believe that O.J. did it.  Earl, wait.  Did you just hear what he said?  That he should get his job back.  He should get his job back.  Actually, he should have got his job back at NBC.  Well, Earl, you'll be happy to know I've got a surprise announcement right now.  It's O.J. Simpson doing the Black Rock Coalition show here on WNEW, the show that Earl pitched O.J. 
[00:28:30]  You know, this is the thing.  Like, you know, a lot of these black people out there, like, you know, they know that he did it.  I mean, if they had to swear, who did it?  They would know he did it.  But the thing is, they just won't say it.  Just say it, Earl.  People have said it.  I'm convinced he didn't act alone.  But you know he did it, though, right?  I know.  I told you that.  It was O.N.J., two killers I'm looking for, and Pedro Guerrero. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, Vinny the Racist, you're a comedian, right?  Well, you know, now that you mention that, I'm trying to become a comedian.  I got some jokes for you, some O.J. jokes.  What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?  What?  Nothing.  You told her twice already.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  But let me tell you something.  Listen, what's the first thing a woman does when she gets out of a battered woman's clinic?  What, O.J.? 
[00:29:30]  The dishes, if she knows what's good for her.  And don't hang out with that coke-snortin' Pedro Guerrero.  There he goes, in my car.  I got to go slit his throat.  911, it's the O.J.  I'm turning myself in.  O.N.J.  I'm not really a racist, and you could ask anybody, because at home, my TV is colored.  But the thing is...  Oh, man.  Jesus. 
[00:30:00]  But seriously, folks, I'm a regular cutter.  Seriously.  My brothers...  Hey, what would you call Pedro Guerrero if he was in the Flintstones?  What, O.J.?  A spic.  A spic.  A spic.  A spic.  But seriously, folks, did you hear the one about the football player that killed his wife and her boyfriend? 
[00:30:30]  Uh, no, O.J.  Where the hell have you been?  I thought everyone heard that.  That wasn't a joke.  Can I plug my gig?  I'll be it.  Bananas and rascals in Ocean.  The real rascals.  I like to complain about Dice.  He ripped off my buddy, Pedro Guerrero.  Matt, what's up? 
[00:31:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  You can incorporate O.J. into your video game.  Let him run around and slash people's throats.  O.J. will just, like, pop out of a room at some point.  That's right.  I don't know.  I don't think O.J. would win against some of the armament that's in this game.  Put me and the knife together with some innocent bystanders, and that's a game.  Got to make the robo O.J.  Robo O.J.  Robo O.J.  He golfs and kills people while looking for the real killers. 
[00:31:30]  Yes, of course.  People are laughing at me.  The new O.J. PlayStation 2 game.  Slash and burn.  You're going to love it.  I golf and kill people.  Oh, no.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  This is Opie and Anthony on Philadelphia's number one rock station, 94 WISB. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Why don't we play the Arnold Schwarzenegger prank call?  Yeah, let's hear these.  These are great.  One of our listeners turned us on to these damn things, and they're really, really funny. 
[00:32:30]  Someone out there, we don't even know who to give credit to, they're playing Arnold sound  bites.  Sound clips, yeah, from his movies or an interview or something.  And the person on the phone is just responding to Arnold.  Responding to a tape.  Yeah, a tape.  All right.  Here's the first one that we played last week.  Investigator Lodge.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How are you?  I'm all right.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Okay.  Who is your daddy, and what does he do? 
[00:33:00]  Who?  Who is your daddy?  Who are you talking about?  Who are you?  Well, who are you?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Hey, this is the motel.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, if you're a cop, you idiot, come over here and talk to me, okay?  You son of a bitch.  And I don't know what he does.  This is a switchboard at the Gator Lodge.  Stop it.  I don't stop nothing, you idiot.  Stop it. 
[00:33:30]  I love it.  You know we had a recording.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  You can't even talk.  So that's the one we've been playing off and on for the last week.  Yes, Rick.  Right.  That's the one we found last week.  Somebody sent it to us.  I forget who it was, but thanks whoever you are.  And then we went on to Napster and found more.  Mm-hmm.  That was on Napster?  Yeah.  Nice.  So this one's a phone call done to Hooters.  Yeah, this is pretty good, too.  This is a good one?  Yeah.  All right.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Prank calls. 
[00:34:00]  I'm on Hooters San Jose.  This is Kay.  How can I help you?  How are you?  Good.  First, I would like to just get to know you.  Get to know me?  Yeah.  Well, I'm too sorry.  You son of a bitch.  What?  Stop whining.  Stop whining?  Yeah.  I'm not whining.  What are you talking about?  Who are you?  I'm someone that works at this restaurant.  You lack discipline.  What?  You lack discipline.  Do I like discipline? 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  You need to call a different line.  This is Hooters.  That is great.  That is funny, man.  The one that makes that is what he just says.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting another one queued up here.  George, what's up?  George.  Yo.  Yo, it's Sean, not George.  All right.  Yo, what's up, guy?  Yo, that is the funniest you ever played.  That's hysterical.  I think he said the S.  No, I didn't.  The funniest S ever played. 
[00:35:00]  Cool.  All right.  Be good.  All right.  Yeah, that is funny stuff, man.  Someone should go to line three because they're turning us on to other prank calls done by other  people.  I like the first one, Tim.  If we say it, you know, other people are going to get it before we can.  Who is your daddy?  All right.  We got two more.  Stop whining.  What's this one, Rick?  Arnold calls some barbecue place?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's called Cotton's Barbecue.  Cotton's Barbecue.  All right.  This is a really good one. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Hi.  You son of a bitch.  How are you?  All right.  Who do you want to speak with?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Charles Kimball?  Yes.  This is Cotton's Barbecue.  Ask for Charles Kimball?  Yeah.  Ask for somebody named Charles Kimball.  Charles Kimball.  So could you describe Charles Kimball?  Yes.  Could you tell her how Mr. Kimball looks?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Detective?  Oh, he's a Detective John Kimball. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, I'm a police officer.  Oh.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Um, excuse me, sir, but this is Cotton's Barbecue.  This is not a police station.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  It sounds awesome.  That is so good.  Greg, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm checking to see if those clips are going to be on Foundry Music later.  Yeah, we should put them on FoundryMusic.com for you guys. 
[00:36:30]  All right, take it easy, guys.  All right, Greg.  That one is hilarious.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Danny, what's going on?  What's happening, man?  Yo, that is the scream, dude.  That is one of the funniest things you guys ever played, man.  Oh, that is great.  My God.  Right on, man.  Right on, dude.  Yo, all right.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, we're getting the last one queued up here.  Uh, Dan, what's going on?  Nothing, man.  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  That's great.  I just want to find out where I can get that on Napster.  Uh, just type in Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Yeah, try that or go to FoundryMusic.com, I think. 
[00:37:00]  Right, Steve?  They're on the site right now and they were done by a group called Holy Outlaws, I believe.  So they're all there.  They're already on your site?  Yeah, they've been there for about a week.  Where are they?  Under the files?  Soundclips.  They're all MP3s.  They're all there.  FoundryMusic.com, go to Soundclips.  Uh, let's see.  We got the fourth one.  Preferred Realty?  Yeah.  All right.  Preferred Realty.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions. 
[00:37:30]  And I want to have them answered immediately.  Who's this, Dave?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, how about come over here and I'll whoop your goddamn ass.  How about that shit?  Yeah.  All right?  You son of a bitch.  That's great, man.  Call me that.  If you got a problem, get over here.  Otherwise, get off of the bone and quit being an idiot.  But I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach.  I will go back. 
[00:38:00]  That is great.  Wow.  That is great.  Arnold loses his mind in that one.  That's hilarious.  Leo, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just found out that Arnold Schwarzenegger is actually funnier on this tape than he is in the movie.  He is.  No doubt.  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[00:38:30]  No doubt.  Thanks, Leo.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Which one do you want to hear again real fast?  The Hooters one is hilarious.  That's good.  They're all good.  I don't know.  The Preferred Realty is my favorite.  Well, screw it.  We'll play all three again.  I don't care.  Here's Hooters.  Oh, where'd you go?  Over here.  Thanks for going to Hooters San Jose.  This is Kay.  How can I help you?  How are you?  Good.  First, I would like to just get to know you.  You get to know me?  Yeah.  Well, I'm too sorry. 
[00:39:00]  You son of a bitch.  What?  Stop whining.  Stop whining?  Yeah.  I'm not whining.  What are you talking about?  Who are you?  I'm someone that works for this restaurant.  You lack discipline.  What?  You lack discipline.  Do I like discipline?  Yes.  You need to call a different line.  This is Hooters.  She doesn't even get it right.  Do I lack discipline?  Can't understand Arnold.  Hey, Randy.  Do I lack discipline? 
[00:39:30]  Hey, Randy.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, man?  That Arnold stuff's pretty good.  Yeah.  I was just wondering if either one of you guys or somebody else go into production and  mix up those Arnold clips with some of Rick on the phone from the Voyabush.  You could get a pretty good thing out of that, you know?  You know, you're probably right.  Can we take some of those and Rick's answers from the bus when he was getting arrested?  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Uh-oh.  The cops are here.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Come on, man.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  Take it easy.  Let me go to Bob. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  Hey, Hopi.  How are you?  Everyone's here.  What's up?  I remember you a long time ago.  I used to call you every night.  What is this?  But anyway, going back to what I said, you've got to stop this.  I just had a double hernia operation.  Yeah.  And you're making the stitches pop out.  All right.  All righty, guys.  Thank you, Bob.  All right, bye.  We got the preferred realty again.  A ton of people saying just play him over and over again.  Yeah, I know.  Here we go.  For preferred realty.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you. 
[00:40:30]  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  And I want to have them answered immediately.  Who's this, Dave?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, how about I come over here and I'll whoop your goddamn ass?  How about that shit?  Yeah.  All right?  You son of a bitch.  That's great, man.  Call me that.  You got a problem?  Get over here.  Otherwise, get off of the phone and quit being an idiot.  But I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach. 
[00:41:00]  I will, bye.  Ah, that is the best line.  That is the best friggin' line, man.  Lewis, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Sorry, I ran off the curb on the parkway.  I hit the thing.  I scratched up my Camaro.  They're funny, man.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  They're so friggin' funny.  Yeah, they're really funny.  Goddamn.  Tony, what's up?  Dude, man, how stupid are these friggin' people?  It's the South. 
[00:41:30]  Dude, you know what you got to do?  Huh?  Get some clips from Conan the Barbarian.  Yeah.  Him and a guy are walking through the village and the hookers are bothering him.  Yeah.  Arnold turns around and goes, ah, you old slut.  And they have the crumb one, and then he goes, who do you pray to?  And the other guy goes, the four winds.  Yeah, not a bad idea.  All right, Tony, thank you.  Guys rule, man.  All right.  That is so damn funny.  Here's the Cotton's Barbecue.  All right.  You son of a bitch. 
[00:42:00]  How are you?  All right.  Who are you listening with?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Charles Kimball?  Yes.  This Cotton's Barbecue.  Ain't for Charles Kimball?  Yeah.  I think somebody named Charles Kimball.  Charles Kimball.  So could you describe Charles Kimball?  Yes.  Could you tell her how Mr. Kimball looks?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Detective?  Oh, he's a detective, John Kimball.  Hey, I'm a police officer. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Um, excuse me, um, sir, but this is Cotton's Barbecue.  This is not a police station.  What an idiot.  He keeps saying he is the cop.  He doesn't even get it.  We've got to find more of these.  Those are great.  I hear there's a bunch of them out there.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, look at this.  I don't even have room for my fist.  Now you get, like, the calls from people that go, oh, I know the guy that does this. 
[00:43:00]  Remember when the Jerky Boys first came out?  Yeah.  Everyone knew who they were.  No, it's a friend of my brother's cousin, I swear.  We've got to get more, though.  Well, we've got the original one that we had last week.  We'll play this and we'll take a break, okay?  Cool.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Okay.  Who is your daddy and what does he do? 
[00:43:30]  Who?  Who is your daddy?  Who are you talking about?  Who are you?  Well, who are you?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Hey, this is a motel.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, if you're a cop, you idiot, come over here and talk to me, okay?  You son of a bitch.  And I don't know what he does.  This is a switchboard at the Gator Lodge.  Stop it.  I don't stop nothing, you idiot.  Stop it. 
[00:44:00]  I love Snatch.  Bring on the horse.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You filthy criminals.  Where's that anthrax?  That's going to make a sweeper.  Where's the kaboom?  This is Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  This is Opie and Anthony.  94 WISP.  That the sun never grinds your eyes.

[00:45:00]  Mark, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, Mark?  Yeah.  I just want to let you know that I'm drunk right now, okay?  And I took boxers.  You took what?  The muscle relaxers.  The muscle relaxers?  I took ten of them.  Ten of them. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  Please tell me you're driving.  So you're trying to kill yourself, sir?  Yeah, more or less.  That's a pretty good way to do it.  And I'd like to talk to you guys before I die.  What's the matter, dude?  Why do you want to do that?  Well, girlfriend must make.  Well, I've got dumped, too.  So what?  You just move on.  It sucks, but you move on.  Your girlfriend dumped you, so you decided to take some muscle relaxers?  Dude.  Dude.  I'm sorry.  I did not mean to curse.  Hey, you don't want to curse in your last couple of minutes on earth.  I know that.  I look at you guys every day.  Yeah, don't curse. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, you're going to ruin your life.  Don't ruin ours.  What did you take?  What did you take, really?  Hey, I drank a cup of vodka.  Yeah.  I had four shots of vodka.  Yeah.  And I took ten of these muscle relaxers that I got prescribed to me a couple months ago.  For what?  My back.  Read the label.  What's the actual name of the drug?  Want me to read them?  Go ahead.  Let me turn off my air conditioner, because it's, like, too noisy. 
[00:46:30]  No, you don't want to stink.  If no one finds you, leave that A.C., blast them.  All right.  Go ahead.  Read the label.  Read the label.  It says, may cause drowsiness.  Alcohol may intensify this effect.  What's the name of the actual thing?  Methacarbamol.  What?  Methacarbamol.  Methacarbamol.  Spell that.  M-E-T-H.  E-T-H.  O-C.  O-C. 
[00:47:00]  A-R.  A-R.  B-A-M-O-L.  All right.  All right.  Let me see that.  And where do you live, Mark?  Rick?  I live in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, right in Philly.  You live in where?  Haddon Heights, New Jersey.  All right.  Right out of Philly.  Right out of Philly?  Yes.  All right.  And what's your last name?  Mark?  Yeah.  What's your last name? 
[00:47:30]  I don't think I should give my last name.  Yes.  What?  I don't think I should give my last name.  Oh, then you're cool.  You don't want to die.  All right.  How long will you date this chick for?  What have I been dating this chick for?  Yeah.  How long will you deal with her for?  Yeah.  Mark?  Are you falling asleep?  No, but I'm saying.  Mark, you're on your cell phone.  You're on a cell phone.  Which means you're in a car or something.  Mark?  I'm in front of my house.  You're in front of your house? 
[00:48:00]  I'm in front of my house.  What?  I'm in front of my cell phone.  Hold on.  He's got no cell phone in his house?  Should we save his life or let him die?  Well, I got distracted because our Ms. Pac-Man machine arrived.  Oh, thank God.  All right.  Screw this.  Woo!  Think I'm kidding?  Did you see that guy wield a Ms. Pac-Man machine past the studio door?  We're going retro around here.  Thank God.  We got the foosball table.  Oh, is that dedicated to our little friend on the phone? 
[00:48:30]  Is he still here?  Hello?  Mark?  Yeah.  You're full of crap.  You're on a cell phone.  I know I'm on a cell phone.  All right.  Why are you on a cell phone?  Because I don't have a home phone.  You don't have a home phone?  No.  I owe Verizon too much money.  All right.  Is that why you're going to try to off yourself?  Well, dude, dude, this girl, just like, I was doing bad.  I was in a poor living situation, and this girl gets me into an apartment, got me a really 
[00:49:00]  good job, and now she wants to leave me.  What's the, um...  I thought you said she left you.  She's leaving me.  She's in the process of leaving me.  How long are you dating her?  Six months.  Ugh!  Six months and you're going to kill yourself or some broad are you nuts?  Six months?  I love her.  Dude, stop it.  I love my ex-girlfriend too.  Who cares if she's living or dead?  Stop it.  How old did you say he was?  How old are you?  Um, I turned 21 on Saturday.  Ah, geez, dude.  That's a little too young to off yourself.  Look at Mr. Tools. 
[00:49:30]  He's still hanging on to life with his artificial heart.  He sees value in it.  Dude, if you're a Met fan and you kill yourself, I almost understand.  But if some broad after six months, come on, stop.  Just move on.  I guess I should die.  I guess I should die because I am a Met fan.  All right, well.  All right, Mark.  We think you're full of crap, man.  What's the...  I know you...  Oh, hey, listen.  I know you guys...  I'm just...  I'm out here for an intention getter.  But the whole thing is, if I do die, I don't know if I will die.  Yeah.  I just wanted to talk to you guys because I think you guys are totally awesome. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  All right, Mark.  Well, maybe you should, like, tell us what street you're at so we can...  Save your life.  Yeah, save your life.  And, dude, you're not 21.  It's illegal for you to be drinking.  I am 21.  Oh, okay.  I turned 21.  Hey, Mark.  I'm August 18th.  Mark, if we save your life, we will give you tool tickets.  They're coming to Philly.  You want to do that?  We'll trade your life for a pair of tickets.  How's that?  Cool.  It seems pretty cool.  Yeah, right? 
[00:50:30]  All right.  What do I got to do?  All right.  Hold on.  And then we're going to need your address to send you the tickets, though.  All right.  You promised me you'll send me tool tickets.  We promise we will give you tool tickets.  Yeah, but we have to give your address out so someone can save your life, and then we'll  give you the tool tickets.  See?  See how that works?  All right.  I just don't want to give my address on the air, though.  All right.  Give it off the air.  All right.  Who do I got to talk to?  But we need to send someone over there.  Just get his town name and call them. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  What town are you in?  I'm in Haddon Heights.  And you took, what, 10 muscle relaxers?  Yeah.  And lots of alcohol in you?  Um, well, I drank about a cup.  Aw, you keep breaking up, dude.  We want to save your life, but we've got to make it sound good for the radio.  All right.  Do you hear?  Don't make him work for it.  Right.  This isn't Rich Voss, is it?  You almost hear him talking over the big teeth of his.  Yeah.  Who's in the studio right now, bro?  What?  No, it's Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's in the studio. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  I'm sorry.  Mark, all right.  Who can we call to, like, save your life, and then we'll give you the tool tickets?  Because we've got to be able to save your life to give you the tickets.  Someone is saying, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Rachel wants it on this.  Uh, Rachel.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  You tell me.  Nothing.  I want tool tickets.  The kid's not going to die.  Throw yourself in front of a bus.  Look at this.  Now there's people going, he's not going to die.  Give me the tool tickets.  See that?  People are trying to take your life for tool tickets. 
[00:52:00]  That's so great.  Mark, I might have to give the tool tickets to someone else.  They say you're not going to die.  You don't really sound close to death's door.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to curse.  They'll get it down the hall.  You don't sound as close to death's door as you would if you drank so much vodka and took ten muscle relaxers.  All I know is I just want this, like, emotional pain to go away.  All right.  Give out your address on the air.  If a guy stops in front of your house and sees you in the car on the cell phone and can verify that it's you, I'll give you tool tickets. 
[00:52:30]  That means I have to go outside then because I'm inside my living room.  You said you were outside the house before.  I said I'm inside.  All right.  You're breaking up.  Well, yeah.  I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  You go outside on your front lawn.  You give your address.  First guy that shows up that can verify that it's you, then we'll give you the tool tickets.  Then you get the tool tickets.  All right.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Are you there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you got to do?  And if you don't want people to know you're dressed, then, like, go to the, you know, go to the corner and give us the, you know.  Give us the corner you're on.  Right. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  What corner of?  What?  Hold on.  He's going to give the corner.  I don't have a better reception in a minute.  Wait a minute.  He's going outside.  He's going outside?  He's going outside?  I'd like a better reception.  Could you get a new cell phone plan before you die?  This stinks.  My cell phone sucks.  Never buy a microphone.  All right.  So where are you going now, Mark?  I'm going outside.  I don't have better reception.  What?  He's going to?  Better reception.  All right.  Never buy a Motorola, he said.  Ron, I know you're ready to drop dead and all, but we're doing a radio show here. 
[00:53:30]  Snap it up.  Right.  Don't sound so depressed.  If we're going to save you, we've got to save you before the commercial break.  Yeah.  Yeah, this isn't sponsored, you know.  Yeah.  This guy's suicide.  Sponsored by Sam Adams.  Horny goat weed.  Right.  That's a great ad for Sam Adams.  Hello?  Hey, Mark.  All right.  Where are you?  Hey, did you guys hear me?  Yeah.  Now we can hear you.  Nice.  All right.  Because, like, I'm, like, outside now.  I'm by my truck.  All right.  You're by your truck.  What street are you on?  Uh, well, I don't want to give my exact address, but I'll give you the cross street. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  Give the cross street.  Here's how it's going to work.  You're going to give a cross street.  Okay.  Someone that's in that area is going to drive by.  Then we will talk to that person and talk to you, and you get the tool ticket.  And guess what?  The person that shows up first to save Mark's life will also get tool tickets.  How about that?  Mark?  All right.  I am on the corner of the Black Horse Pike.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  It crapped out.  Say it again.  I'm on the corner of the Black Horse Pike. 
[00:54:30]  Black Horse Pike.  Uh-huh.  Black Horse Pike is the name of the street?  Yeah.  Yes.  Also known as Route 168.  Okay.  And Narbeth Avenue in Haddon Heights.  And Narbeth Avenue.  All right.  First person that gets there and saves his life and gives us a little lowdown on what's going on.  Gets tool tickets, and you get tool tickets.  And you'll get tool tickets as well, Mark.  Unless you're dead already, then we are not obligated to give you the tool tickets.  All right.  Let me ask you this. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say I do die.  Yeah.  You're not going to die.  If you just gave out those two streets, you're fine now.  Why?  Honestly, I want to die because I just want the pain to go away.  Oh, it'll go away.  Tool is great.  I just...  Dude, you know what's going to happen?  You know, don't...  In a year or two, it's not even going to look back and go, God, was I a dick.  If we give you the tool tickets, and then you off yourself before the tool show, there's 
[00:55:30]  going to be a lot of pissed off people there.  Pretty pissed.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, someone else could have gone to tool.  All right.  Did you really give those streets?  What's that?  Those were the real streets?  I swear to God.  Black Horse Pike.  You better watch out when you're swimming again now.  Black Horse Pike.  Yeah.  And Narbeth Avenue.  I'm standing right on the corner.  All right.  Know what sucks about this?  There's a long delay, so it's going to take a while before people get the address.  Yeah, it's going to take a while for Philly to get out there right now.  You guys have a...  It's about five minutes away. 
[00:56:00]  Five minutes outside Philly?  All right.  Oh, by the way...  Yeah, I'm about ten minutes outside Philly.  Now, hold on.  By the way, Tool's going to be at the First Union Center Thursday, September 27th.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday.  I love this show.  Through Ticketmaster.  Hold on.  I want to see if Sean's close.  Hold on.  First person that shows up will get Tool Tickets, and Mark will get them as well.  Sean.  Dude.  Are you close to where he's at?  Yeah, I'm on King's Highway.  I'm heading up towards Black Horse Pike.  I'm about two minutes from Black Horse Pike.  All right.  First person there will get the Tool Tickets. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Cool.  Hey, do me a favor.  Yeah.  Ask him if I make a right or a left on a Black Horse Pike.  Where are you coming from?  Mark?  Are you coming from Del Mar or Haddonfield?  Haddonfield.  He sounds pretty lucid now.  You're going to make a what?  Is that you right?  Yeah, yeah.  Someone just pulled up.  All right.  Hold on.  A little red escort.  Uh-oh.  Someone pulled up in a Volkswagen right now.  All right.  Well, then, Sean, we'll have to let you go.  Yeah.  Someone else showed up already. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Go back to Mark, who is sounding very lucid now.  What's going on with that?  Hey, Mark.  Mark, you sounded a lot more effed up before.  Okay.  Yeah.  Someone just showed up on the corner here.  Is it a Volkswagen?  Yeah.  All right.  Give them the phone.  All right.  They want to open up.  They want to talk to you.  All right.  Tell them to drive away with his phone.  No.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  What's your name, man?  Hey, this is Dan.  Dan.  How effed up does this guy look? 
[00:57:30]  All right.  Somebody else just pulled up.  What's up?  Does this guy look effed up?  Uh, he looks pretty whacked.  He looks pretty whacked?  Yeah.  His eyes are all messed up.  Are they?  Um, ask him to show you the bottle of pills.  You got the bottle of pills, man?  Hey, you got the bottle?  What's that?  They want to see the bottle.  I got to run up to my apartment.  All right.  You want to wait while he rounds up?  I'm going to pull up to his parking lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can do that.  This is who you want to save in your life, too.  Some retired O&A listener. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, Dan.  I don't know.  There's some other guy here, I guess.  I don't know.  There's going to be a lot of people there in a few minutes.  Dan.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Yo.  Are you a huge Tool fan?  Yeah, I sure am.  You were the first person on the scene to save Mark's life, so you got a pair of tickets  to see Tool at the First Union Center Thursday, September 27th.  Tickets go on sale Saturday.  How do I collect those?  You'll stay on the line.  Can I give you my cell phone number, too?  Because this guy is terrible.  Yeah, hold on.  We'll figure it all out. 
[00:58:30]  But we just want to make sure this guy is going to be all right.  Let's go through some of the overdose symptoms of methicarbamol.  All right.  If he's not whack, do I still get the tickets?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, severe weakness, fainting, breathing  difficulties, irritability.  He just kind of looked like he was sweating.  Seizures.  Feeling of paralysis.  Profuse sweating.  Is he sweating?  Yeah, he just...  I wouldn't say profuse.  He was wearing like a black t-shirt and stuff, though.  He was out here sweating. 
[00:59:00]  Some guy just ran up with him.  He looks pretty effed up, though.  Uh, not really.  I mean, I wouldn't call like 911 if, you know.  Right, right.  Wow, you wouldn't believe.  I guess you probably wouldn't believe how many people are out here.  He better be dying.  Wow.  Yeah, they hate to think we saved somebody who didn't need to be saved.  These toll tickets are very valuable for our radio show.  Yeah, and we're just giving them all right.  Oh, wait.  So there's about 10 guys in the apartment.  Oh, he won't let anybody out.  Oh, here he comes.  All right, he's coming back out?  He's got the bottle of vodka. 
[00:59:30]  Does he have the pills on him, though?  He got the pills on you?  Let me see that phone real quick.  Let me talk to them real quick.  The cops are here.  Hang on, hang on.  Oh, the cops are there.  There you go.  Yeah.  Good.  I want those toll tickets.  Now I got the police here.  Ah, there you go.  Well, good.  I guess they want the phone.  That's fine.  Make sure you get me back for those tickets.  Hang on.  All right.  We got to take care of Dan and Mark.  Hey, police guys.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hello. 
[01:00:00]  You cop?  Hello.  Can you see the phone?  Yeah.  All right.  We got the cops there.  Whatever here, guys.  What's up?  Hello.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, why don't we just do a road show in that neighborhood now?  Yeah.  That sounds like a lot of fans in that neck of the woods.  We got enough people there.  Hey, what's going on?  Somebody better tell us what's happening there.  Hello.  Hello.  Well, I don't think he's going to die.  Wouldn't it be great if we could get his ex-girlfriend in here to wow?  Ah, that's awful.  Wouldn't that be nice?  All we can find is the last number, isn't it? 
[01:00:30]  I'm trying to listen in at the kids' call.  All right, listen.  Who's got the phone?  Yeah, no one's talking on the phone.  They're just holding it up.  Who's got the cell phone?  Hello?  Someone with a cell phone in the area, please give the show a call.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello, officers. 
[01:01:00]  No?  Mike says, just tell him to J-O.  That might help.  Can't hurt.  Can't hurt any situation.  Ever.  Ever.  Why do they grab the cell phone and they're not talking to us?  I don't know.  Officer.  Officer.  I'm feeling really good about the fact that, you know, a new city, Opie, and the cops showed up so quickly.  That's good.  I'm feeling loved.  Where's your idea? 
[01:01:30]  Now they're rousting them.  Where's your idea?  Who's on the phone with YSC?  Tyler.  You were.  You're the one, right?  You're the one, right?  Your girlfriend?  Yeah.  Okay.  Come on over here, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Bob, what do you think, LP?  You think he's going to make it?  What do you think, Bob?  Always time for a platoon reference.  We're going to make sure, okay?  I understand, okay?  If you need some help, we'll get you some help. 
[01:02:00]  Okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, brother.  All right, Mark.  Have a seat in the car.  Sean.  Yo.  What's happening?  Yo, man.  You would not believe how many cops are here, guys.  Really?  You would not believe.  There's got to be about 10 cops here.  You're the one on the phone with YSC, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, Sean.  What's going on?  You have to be our eyes.  Well, they pulled the one guy aside, and they pulled the guy who showed up first aside,  and they're, like, questioning both of them.  I can't.  And I don't think that guy, Mark,'s messed up at all. 
[01:02:30]  Well, he is now.  Jesus.  Now he is.  What's that?  They hung up the other phone.  Sean, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here.  All right.  They hung up the other phone.  So you've got to describe what's happening.  Yeah.  How many?  Well, you've got about four or five undercover cops here.  You've got three marked units and detectives.  What they're doing right now is they're questioning the guy who showed up first, and he's sitting 
[01:03:00]  here in a silver Volkswagen.  They pulled him out of the car and are questioning.  Oh, that poor guy just showed up.  The guy who called in, and Mark, I guess, he's, like, nowhere around.  I don't even know where he went.  Well, when they got out of jail, they're going to toll.  I think the guy was joshing you, man.  They put him in the car, I think.  No, the guy that originally made the call and said he was killing himself, is he there?  I think he is, because what I heard on the phone.  I don't see him, though, dude.  But I think they took him in the car, because what I heard from the other cell phone was  the cop asking him, are you the guy with the girlfriend that originally called YSP? 
[01:03:30]  And he said yes, and he goes, okay, Bob.  All right there, Bob.  Get in the car, Bob.  Why are you telling yourself, Jewish?  What do you think, Al-Pay?  Sean, that's what I thought.  He got his cell phone here.  I don't know.  Sean, how many cars are there now?  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  I got a bad feeling about this one, Bob.  I was just showing up to see if this guy was, like, telling the truth.  I live right down the street.  Okay.  And I was just listening to the radio show.  What did you see?  Nothing.  I just saw the guy over there in a silver car.  He was talking to guys on the radio.  And the guy came out, and you guys showed up. 
[01:04:00]  Where did he come out from?  Right over here on the right-hand side.  He was over in there?  Yeah.  Like I said, I don't know.  I don't know.  Was he in a vehicle?  No, I have no idea whether he was in a vehicle or not.  Like I said, I just pulled up, like, two seconds before you guys pulled up.  It just happened to go up.  Yeah.  I live in Haddon Heights, so I figured I'd just come on over and see what was going on.  Did you guys hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can see what's going to happen here.  It seems to me like the cops are going to start to think maybe we, like it was a bit. 
[01:04:30]  No, there's no bit.  The guy called up out of nowhere.  Oh, boy.  Right.  I think they're actually going to arrest this guy.  How could they arrest him?  He called up?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, they're looking to see if he was driving, to see where he lived, or...  Why, is being a horse's ass illegal?  Anything else?  I mean, you've got firefighters, EMTs here.  Well, you know something?  The guy calls us up.  He says he drank vodka, Black House, which is really good, by the way, and took 10 muscle 
[01:05:00]  relaxers.  Well, you know, I think it's our civic duty to, well, let him die.  Make sure the guy isn't BSing.  You have to.  Yeah, right?  There you go.  If he's being a tool and calling up a report like that to us, I don't know what legal ramifications  there are.  Can you look it up?  Hooking you guys up?  Can I get the tool tickets anyway?  Yeah, what the hell?  I love you guys, man.  I listen to you, like, every day.  Yeah, I think we got some, don't we?  Yeah, hold on a line.  We could get Sean some tool tickets.  Because Mark might be busy the day in the tool shop. 
[01:05:30]  You guys are so cool.  Thanks, man.  How many people are there now?  Well, we got one, two, three undercover, a couple detectives, one, two, three marked cars.  Don from East Meadows saying he should have hid under the kiddie pool on the lawn, like  that guy did in Cops.  You never hide under the kiddie pool.  He was in an apartment above a business.  Really?  And now there's a couple of them going inside to see what's going on, I guess. 
[01:06:00]  Glad to see that the cops listened to us in the Philly area.  Steve, what's up?  I think, actually, somebody might have called him.  Steve.  Steve, you in the area?  Steve, what's up, man?  Yeah, man.  Crook Street.  All right, what's going on?  Steve was talking on the phone, calling you guys.  Dude, he looked fine, man.  I think he was just being a tool trying to get some tickets.  He sounded out of it.  I mean, I think he should take his tickets, and he's kind of inconvenient to me because I'm late  for work now.  Right.  Give me the tickets, too.  A lot of people in the area right now?  About 10, 15 people.  Yeah.  Okay.  I mean, it's not that bad.  I mean, it's a bad time to do it, though, you know what I mean? 
[01:06:30]  All right, Steve.  Well, the thing is, it wasn't a ticket giveaway.  Like, we didn't even mention that we were going to give anybody anything.  We just said, if you get the information, we'll give us some information.  It was a way to get him to get out of his name.  We'll give you a tool ticket.  Hey, Sean, could you see the guy?  Yeah, I saw him.  He was wearing, like, a black shirt.  They got him in the back of a squad car right now.  All right.  And they're questioning the guy that pulled up first in that Volkswagen who got there  first.  Working him over with a phone book?  Yeah, they're questioning the guy that was pulled up first.  Wait, the guy that pulled up first? 
[01:07:00]  They're sitting there, like, around, like everyone's standing there.  Wait, who's this?  Who's this, Kevin?  Yeah.  You're checking it out, too?  Yeah.  All right.  If the cops are listening to the broadcast, the first guy that pulled up was just pulling  up to make sure this guy was okay.  He'll get to the bottom of that.  All right, all right.  It's not like these are the same people that run around throwing bombs into buildings.  Dude, it looked like they're actually tearing him in a new ass.  Come on.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  They're tearing him in a new ass.  They're yelling and screaming at him in the back of the patrol car? 
[01:07:30]  Well, they got one of the head firefighters.  He's in there, and he's like, and he looks like he's tearing him in a new ass.  Like, what the F is wrong with you, dude?  The guy that called first is walking towards us right now.  All right.  Get him on the phone.  Tell him you're on the radio with us.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  They want to talk to you.  This is so funny.  Dude, what happened?  Is this Dan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You're the guy that pulled up first to see if this guy was BS or not.  Run us through everything.  If you want it.  All right.  Run us through everything that just happened.  All right. 
[01:08:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because there's so much going on.  Kevin and Sean, you're still on the line, but just don't say a word.  Let Dan talk.  Dan.  Yes.  All right.  Tell us what happened after you gave the phone to the cop.  After I gave the phone to the cops, they took Mark, and they're talking to him right  now.  I'm going to pull up.  And what do they say to you?  Well, at first, I don't know.  At first, I thought they were going to jack me up or something.  They didn't know what was going on, but they're cool now.  They just took my knee down and I'm here with these guys.  You want to come up?  What are they doing with the perp? 
[01:08:30]  Dan?  I don't know.  There's a bunch of people on the phone around here.  Yeah, I know.  They're all calling us.  They're helping us out here.  I hope you got a lot of cool figures.  No, no.  Hey, Dan.  Yeah?  Now, does it look like this guy's effed up or not?  Yeah.  Now that I've looked at him a little bit, he does.  He definitely looks effed up?  He's a little too relaxed.  Are they going to take him away, you think?  The ambulance?  I think so.  You think they're taking him away?  Well, I think they're trying to get him help.  I don't think they're, uh... 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Even if you're goofing around like that, you know, maybe you should talk to somebody.  Yeah, it was stupid.  I mean, they have to do something with him.  Well, yeah, yeah.  All right, hold on, everyone.  Hold on.  Sean!  You!  What's going on?  Well, they brought him out in handcuffs after they went up in the apartment.  Uh-oh.  And they brought down a yellow bag.  They put him in the back of an ambulance.  Oh, they did?  I think they might have taken him to the hospital, probably detoxing.  Well, that means something was going on, because if they were going to take him away and they  didn't think it was serious, they would have just thrown him in the back of a police car.  Yeah, pretty much everybody else was clearing out, though. 
[01:09:30]  All the cops were pretty much just going around.  So the ambulance arrived, and is he in the back of the ambulance right now?  Well, they just left.  The ambulance just left.  Can we get a statement from one of the cops?  I don't know.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, ask one of the cops.  Why'd they cuff him?  Oh, so he doesn't hurt himself.  Why'd they cuff you, Norton?  Criminal.  Hold on a second.  I'm, like, chasing, like, all of them here.  Give me object.  Can I talk to you for a second? 
[01:10:00]  One of the guys who wrote a radio show wanted to talk to you guys.  He said he'd maybe give a statement.  No.  No.  He's going to be all right, though?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  He said he can't give a statement.  All right.  NYPD would have given us one.  Yeah.  Come on.  Philly's finest.  He's going to have to work on the relationship with the Elfie and Anthony show.  NYPD would have completely taken care of us.  Maybe he didn't get a rubber dolly.  This show, this effing jack-off with such a pull, we threw him in the back.  By the way, the guys love you guys. 
[01:10:30]  That's NYPD.  Philly.  No.  No statement.  He's fine.  All right.  So, Sean.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Pretty much it.  Everybody else, everybody's leaving now.  All the cops are leaving.  All right.  So, they pulled him out of his apartment, put him in the back of an ambulance.  He was handcuffed, and they have left the scene.  Yeah.  Okay.  I couldn't, I can't hear you.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  No problem, man.  All right, bro.  Well, how about that?  They've taken him away, and I guess they're going to check him out.  Let's see what Dan's saying.  Dan? 
[01:11:00]  I wonder what was in that bag.  Hey, Dan.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  This is Kevin E., and Dan's talking on another phone.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So, is that pretty much what happened?  Anything else, Dan?  Yeah, we slowly drove by, and we looked into the back of the ambulance, and he was actually  strapped down.  Like, he was on his back.  He was strapped down pretty good?  Yeah.  They were, like, talking to him.  Like, I saw flashlights going.  I guess they were looking at his eyes or something.  Right.  Most of the cops are gone.  And he was taken out of his apartment in handcuffs.  Yeah, he wasn't handcuffed.  They put him in the back of the car. 
[01:11:30]  The one cop looked like he was, like, about to beat him the hell up.  And he was really cursing at him.  I'm like, what the hell is your problem and stuff?  Right.  And then, basically, he's just in the ambulance right now.  All right.  And they took off, right?  Yeah.  Andy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  You tell us.  What's going down?  Oh, this is nuts.  What an epic fool this kid is.  Should have just let him die.  I love you, seriously, Dan.  All right, guys.  Take it easy. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We should take a break.  Hey, Matty, let's do a fake guy taking pills cop thing.  This is how it happens.  It just comes out of nowhere.  What the hell is this?  It doesn't get much realer than this today, folks.  Am I the only one that now understands why his girlfriend dumped him?  This suicide attempt sponsored by Lifestyles Condoms.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, the Post has a great story on your favorite TV host. 
[01:12:30]  Who would that be?  Star Jones from The View.  Ah, yes.  I love Star.  She's a diva, you know, Opie.  Whether you think she is or not, she says it.  So I guess it's true.  Diva.  Anyway, the headline reads, cranky view of Star Jones bash.  All right.  This is unbelievable.  Star Jones was nice enough to invite 60 friends to a barbecue at her summer place in the Hamptons, but not all her guests were so nice. 
[01:13:00]  One ingrate called up MSNBC to complain that guests weren't allowed in the house to use the bathroom, Anthony.  Instead, they were relegated to rented portable toilets on the lawn.  She wouldn't let the guests in her house to use the toilet?  No.  She didn't want guests using her bathroom.  Well, I got a reason for that, honey.  See, my ass is so big, I got a custom built toilet bowl.  It's as big as a jacuzzi.  And I was fearful they would fall in with their skinny, narrow asses. 
[01:13:30]  I'm a diva.  Oh, you're a diva, right.  Also, there were complaints from people that were at this party about the menu that Star Jones selected.  The menu?  What could be wrong with the menu?  Well, Star Jones provided hamburgers and hot dogs for a guest.  Very nice for a barbecue, right?  Uh-huh.  But she reserved the lobster for herself.  Prepared by her personal chef, which she washed down with some champagne. 
[01:14:00]  Washed down?  You can just picture eating the shell and everything.  Someone goes for the lobster.  What a witch.  Oh, it gets better.  So she sits there.  She sits there.  She's eating lobster and champagne.  Right.  And she's giving her guests.  Well, everyone else has weenies. 
[01:14:30]  Hamburgers and hot dogs.  Burgers and weenies.  Yeah.  And she gets the champagne.  I don't think she had champagne for everyone, Anthony.  No, probably.  Just mix up some Kool-Aid for them ingrates.  Get the great Kool-Aid.  And then at one point, she told the chef to make sure that no one else got her lobster.  Oh, that that was for her and not the guests, said a spy.  Hey, that's for me, diva.  It's star stock.  Get in the portable toilet. 
[01:15:00]  You mud people.  I'm a diva.  I use the bathroom in the house.  Star stock?  Yeah.  Star stock.  Star stock.  I don't know no limp biscuit, but I got budded biscuits and they're all mine.  Keep your hands off them.  I'm hungry.  Why do I sound like River now?  I love the red hot chili peppers.  Yeah.  Not the band.  I'm just eating red hot chili peppers.  Yeah, it's star stock.  Pass the corn. 
[01:15:30]  Take a hand off if it even got close to her lobster and champagne.  I'm a diva.  And who would want to use that toilet?  Imagine going into Star's bathroom because you know the first image you would get is 
[01:16:00]  of her on that bowl.  With her big old hair.  Big hair.  It's hard for me to line up.  It's like him.  I got to use one of them, one of those northern bomb sites like they use on a bomber plane just  to line up so I don't hit the seat.  There's a lot of ass over here.  I'm a lawyer.  Here we go.  Let me line up. 
[01:16:30]  There we go.  Stay out the bathroom.  Star, I have to use the bathroom.  Use the tree out back.  This is Star's bathroom.  I'm a diva.  There's another one.  That was a whole claw from my lobster.  That hurt coming out.  That lobster tail. 
[01:17:00]  Look, it's hanging out.  Look, I look like a lobster.  Look at that.  Star, I really need the bathroom.  Use the pool.  Damn, that's a tasty crustacean. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This one's working out pretty good.  That's a tasty crustacean.  Stay out the bathroom.  I'm in here.  I'm a diva. 
[01:18:00]  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  This is Opie and Anthony.  On Philadelphia's number one rock station.  Not E4 W.Y.S.P.  I like it.  I like it.  We'll be right back. 
[01:18:30]  Today's show, 212-757-1027.  I am so psyched to have Carlos Mencia on our radio show, Anthony. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  I've been jamming to your CD.  Jamming.  Whatever.  But, you know, listening to the latest Carlos Mencia CD, and it's hilarious.  That's pretty cool, man.  All right.  It's like funny.  It's cool that, believe it or not, man, it's cool that it's like white guys saying that.  You know, because I swear to God, man, I'm in Texas so much.  It's always, you know, some Spanish, half English, you know what I mean?  You've got to go see him, man.  He's one of our people, you know what I mean?  It's like not even, it's not even he's funny at this point. 
[01:19:30]  It's just, you know, out of loyalty toward the cause.  Yeah, support the cause.  Yeah, exactly.  Support the beaner.  Yeah, exactly.  If you don't go out to see the beaner, then people aren't going to eat beans,  and then the people who plant beans aren't going to make any money,  and then what's going to happen to us, you know what I mean?  It's like the whole circle of life for the beaners, man.  Right on.  I must say, he came in here and he figured it out.  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  Yeah, most brain surgeons can't figure that out.  Most people can't figure it out for some reason.  Well, I had a pet with my friends, you know, like Opie and Anthony.  I go, you know, it's a white guy and Italian guy. 
[01:20:00]  My stupid friend from East LA, oh, come on, dude.  Anthony doesn't, like, it doesn't really have to be an Italian guy.  Like, Julio doesn't have to be a beaner.  Shut up, stupid.  If it was a white guy, it'd be like Tony, not Anthony.  Anthony is, like, Italian, man.  Yeah, true.  Right?  You're right.  If it's Tony, maybe, but Anthony.  When you hear a guy say, hey, my name's Anthony, it always comes.  See, I can't even say Anthony.  Like, it's got, hey, I'm Anthony.  You know, it's got to come out like that, right? 
[01:20:30]  Of course, of course.  So, you know.  I never liked the Tony name, though, because it always came off like Tony was always the.  Tony's like the retarded brother.  Gindo friggin', you know, hey.  Hey, come on, huh?  We're going to go out tonight.  Right.  He's the retarded one.  Have a good time, Mom, Tony, you mother.  And I'm like, I don't want to be, I'll be Anthony.  It's a little more refined.  Yeah.  Tony's the one that says words like doot-doot.  And everybody knows what it means.  You know what I mean?  Hey, that guy's a doot-doot.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:21:00]  What is that?  You know, it made me feel like I'm not an American.  You know what?  Is that some new word in the Webster's?  Doot-doot-doot.  I have no clue, man.  It's fun to go out, though, man.  I mean, it's like, it's been such a long journey for me just to be considered, like, funny.  You know what I mean?  We saw you years ago.  You're hilarious.  Yeah, but it's always, like, the beaner thing first.  Not with you guys.  I'm just saying, like, wherever I go, it's always, like... 
[01:21:30]  Well, you don't see many beaner comics.  Well, you know.  I agree.  You know what?  But you know what it is?  It's just that they cling to it.  There's black comics and white comics and this and that, but not many Mexican comics.  I think they cling, or Puerto Ricans or whatever, but they cling to it is what it is.  You know what I mean?  They cling to that whole, you know, Puerto Ricans is, Mexicans is, and white people that,  and they just do that over and over again.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's like that movie, what's that new movie where the white girls date and the  black guy, the black friends are hating on her, and, you know, and I'm just like, does 
[01:22:00]  that s**t really happen anymore?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, but I mean, does it really happen?  Like, do I, dude, my chick is, like, from Oregon.  She is the whitest thing.  You'll, like, my chick should be going out with you.  That's like how, do you know what I mean?  Like, when you see my chick, you know that dude is successful.  You know what I'm saying?  Or he's a pimp, because this chick is just, woo! 
[01:22:30]  Carlos, the funny thing is, we should swap, because my girlfriend is going out with you.  He's going out with a Puerto Rican girl.  He's going out with a Puerto Rican girl.  Do they ever look at you weird, though?  I never get it.  The family does.  Her family?  A little bit, yeah.  Well, you know, maybe.  But, you know what's funny is that I've encountered that, like, you know what I mean?  That white people are usually much more willing to be like it.  It's cool, you know what I mean?  I mean, it's like the ethnic side that's usually a little, you know, hey, man, I'll come here  dating him.  But, you know, my girl, so, like, my father was just like, you know, does she have a, how 
[01:23:00]  does her mother look, you know?  My dad was in with that, man.  It's just that I don't see it.  I go everywhere.  Dude, I've been in Birmingham, Alabama, in the middle of the night at this place called  the Waffle House with a bunch of rednecks.  Yeah, the old Waffle House.  And I walk in, and I've never, ever, like, had that look like, what the hell is Ed Boehner  doing with our people?  You know what I mean?  Never seen it.  All of a sudden, there's a movie about it, and they're trying to make it like it's America,  you know, the struggles, and the white and the black, you know, we're bringing the racial 
[01:23:30]  issue, you know?  Yeah.  I was like, didn't I see that, like, back in, like, 1970?  Yeah.  Although, although the sisters do get upset when they see a brother with a white chick.  Yeah, but that's only because, that's only because, like, political correctness has gone  to the point where, you know what, you turn on Oprah, right, and then you see a black guy  dating a white girl, and all the audience was like, oh, and LaQuisha was like, damn,  why you got to be leaving us?  Why you got to be going with a white girl?  It has nothing to do with the fact that you got toed, and each breast that you have weighs 
[01:24:00]  300 pounds.  It has nothing to do with the fact that your fat ass looks the way it does.  Nothing to do with that, of course, while the white girl is hot.  You know, it's not like she's some fat guy, I want my Tyrone every night.  It's not like that, you know?  She's a hot chick.  They're dissing her.  But then fat-ass LaQuisha comes out of the retarded white dude with, you know, with one  tooth and a polio hat, you know?  You go, LaQuisha, you go, girl. 
[01:24:30]  That's right, that's right, girl.  You bring on that black love magic.  Bring it home, girl.  You know, it's so, like, you can say, you can, as long as you're dissing white people  in America, you're cool.  You know what I mean?  Say everything you want about white people.  It's cool.  You say black, all of a sudden, you know what I mean?  We go through that on our show.  I know you do.  You make fun of everything, but as soon as you make fun of, you know, a Puerto Rican  or a black guy or something, the phones explode. 
[01:25:00]  We were just talking, we opened up the show today talking about Jesse Jackson, and we got  calls from people going, why do you have to make this a race issue?  We didn't even bring up, I think people know Jesse's black.  We brought up the fact that he couldn't keep his thing in his pants, and he got a chick  pregnant, but then all of a sudden, it's like, well, now you're talking about Jesse, so we're  going to get flack from that because he's a black guy.  Right.  No.  Can't talk about Jesse.  Because he's a hypocrite.  Stay out the bushes. 
[01:25:30]  That's what he should have done.  I think I have the bushes.  Dude, I think it's hilarious, man.  It really is great.  People love this.  But it's funny because here's a guy who's, like, walking around telling everybody how to  be righteous.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Well, the whole time, and the only reason why he got it, he put the story out, is because they  caught him, and they were going to put it on, like, the Inquirer.  So it's not like the guy actually came out and said, you know, whatever.  It's like, Jesse, we got you.  Yeah.  He was forced to say something.  He was forced to do it.  And this guy was counseling Clinton when Clinton was going through his thing. 
[01:26:00]  His chick was four months pregnant.  In the picture.  Yeah.  There's a picture of her next to him.  She's four months pregnant while he's counseling him, but I think what he's telling him is,  is the bitch pregnant?  I think that's what he was talking about.  I don't think he was counseling him.  I think he was telling him, listen, this is what you do.  Give him $10,000.  Keep him quiet, man.  He did say, Clinton said he felt better after Jesse left, after the talk, because Jesse probably  did go, hey, man, you could be me. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, exactly.  This bitch is pregnant.  Yeah, exactly.  And I brought her just so you could look at her.  Yeah, that's probably what he did, man.  I want you to know I got her pregnant.  You are not in a dire circumstance, is I.  I want to hear that guy having sex.  See, that to me is funny.  Now you can picture it.  No, see, no, but to hear it, to see it, oh, yeah, oh, uh-huh, yeah, give it to me.  See, that's funny to me.  Now, I'm sure some black guy is going to call, and you know it's not a black guy.  Black people are laughing their ass off.  It's some politically correct white ass who wants to make the world better for the beaners 
[01:27:00]  and the spits and the niggas of the world because we need to unite.  You know, I swear to God, like, to me, it's all about whatever happened to, like, people,  there's some people right now at work who have their radios really, really low.  Yeah.  Especially right now because, you know, we're talking about race.  Well, whatever happened to freedom of speech, man?  Whatever happened to, like, my dad came to this country so he could make a little more money  and he could say, you suck.  Do you know what I'm saying?  All of a sudden, you go to work and you can't say anything, man. 
[01:27:30]  You do a chick joke.  You're a woman basher.  You do a gay joke.  You know, and of all the people, of all the people to complain about jokes, fags are the  worst.  I mean, completely.  Because if you can take a d**k, you can take a joke.  That's, you know, that's not even a joke.  That's just my motto, man.  Seriously.  That's like, you know, like, how could you say, you hurt me?  I hurt, dude, last night you had a big one in your first place. 
[01:28:00]  I hurt you?  Dude, how am I the, I'm the, dude, man, you gotta look at life a little different, man.  And, you know, it's just like people, you can't, you can't go there, you know?  Hey, and anytime there's a conflict between people of different races, like a white guy  punches a black guy in the face, it's a hate crime.  Maybe the guy was just an a-hole, you know?  Maybe they just got into a fight and he punched the guy in the face.  But everyone's got to label everything hate crimes. 
[01:28:30]  And, uh, and, uh, whatnot.  But the truth of the matter is, maybe he was just an a-hole.  Well, why can't you just call somebody an a-hole?  You can't.  You know what I mean?  Why can't you, you're an a-hole?  You can.  If you're black and you call a black guy that, it's fine.  If you're white, you call a white guy that, it's fine.  But once you mix it up, oh, now you're, now you're a racist and it's horrible.  But you know what, white people?  It's your fault, all right?  I want you to know that.  No, because you made it all politically correct to the point where, like, you know what I mean? 
[01:29:00]  No, nobody can, nobody can say anything anymore.  I used to go on stage a long time ago and tell white people and tell Hispanics and blacks, too, listen, man, stop telling white people not to do these jokes.  All right?  Because I knew what was going to happen and I swear to God it happened.  And last month, I went on a radio show and they told me, you can't do jokes.  Oh, no, no, that's not what it was.  I'll say it.  The Tonight Show.  They called me and they said, I'm the only guy to get a standing ovation in The Tonight Show since Jay Leno took over.  But this is like a year and a half or two years ago and they never had me on it. 
[01:29:30]  So they called me the other day and they said, we'd love to have you on the show.  But you can't do any ethnic jokes.  Only jokes that are ethnic, like, against you.  You could do any kind of Spanish, you know, jokes that you want, but you can't say black.  You can't do anything at all.  That's sad.  And I knew that day was going to happen.  You know what I mean?  And now that day's come where, like, even I can't do jokes about other people now because people are sensitive.  You know what I mean?  And you hear my feelings.  So they told you not to do it and you stuck to your guns and said. 
[01:30:00]  I said, then I won't do it because then it doesn't represent what I do.  You know what I mean?  Because I pick on everybody.  I don't care if you're white or you're black.  You know, to me, it doesn't matter.  Because the way I look at it is this.  If you think you're black, watch the Olympics.  Your black ass is American when America needs you.  I ain't never seen an African-American gold medal count in my life.  You know what I mean?  All of a sudden, you ain't a nigga no more.  Oh, you're one of us, boy.  Bring your gold medal and put it up.  All we care about is that little medal count. 
[01:30:30]  It doesn't matter who brought it there.  They don't care.  You know what I mean?  You're not a lesbian.  You're a member of the softball team.  Bring your medal up here.  We don't care, you know.  We don't care.  Amy Chow, yeah, the closest you've ever come to China is rice-a-roni.  Get your ass up here.  You know what I'm saying?  That Italian girl, Mochiano.  You know what I mean?  You're not Italian.  Bring your ass up here.  Horses head my ass.  Bring your gold medal up here.  We don't care.  Nobody cares.  You know, when America needs you, nobody cares.  You know, all of a sudden, listen, everyday life, we got to worry about it. 
[01:31:00]  I got to, am I feeling sensitive?  I could care less.  If you're easily offended, and I don't mean this in a, stay your ass away from my show.  Do not even come close to my show.  Well, last time, the time previous before this one, Flight 800 crashed, and the day after  it crashed, I was listening.  And here's how my comedy works.  I stayed up all night watching it.  You know, I cried part of the night just thinking, I can't believe, thinking some bomber did it. 
[01:31:30]  It's like, man, you know, if you want to fight us, bring it on.  You know what I mean?  But don't kill my kid on the way to school and then pretend, I am good warrior.  You know what I mean?  You're a pussy, dude.  You know, if you want to fight, bring it on.  You know, tell me face to face.  We'll scrap, dude.  You know, and then you kick my ass.  I walk away from it.  You know, you beat me.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But don't, like, go for, like, the week.  Don't put a bomb in a plane and then pretend, you know what I mean?  Like, you're doing something great.  So, anyway, I was pissed.  And then I heard that the name, one of the pilot's names, this is true, of Flight 800, 
[01:32:00]  was Kevorkian, all right?  Oh, my.  Exactly, man.  I went on the next day, and I said, listen, if I'm on a plane, and this guy comes out and  says, this is your captain, Kevorkian speaking, my ass is running off the plane.  I'm off, dude.  I'm getting the next flight.  I don't care.  I don't care, coincidence, family member.  I really don't give a s***.  I am off the plane.  I heard that.  I heard that.  I'm just getting off, man.  There's no way, you know?  Old people are going to be like, why are you getting off?  You know, because I'm not even sick. 
[01:32:30]  I'm running.  I'm sorry, man.  You know what I'm saying?  And I just do not, you know, I don't care.  And then I did that joke, and this one dude was like, got up, and you're, you're, you don't  know, and people died, and died, and died, and he was all mad.  And I'm just like, look, man.  It's comedy.  That's what you're here for.  It's a comedy show.  I swear to God, go tonight.  You'll see.  There'll be jokes, and people will go, some people during jokes, and knowing that they're  jokes, go, ooh. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Now it's not funny anymore.  I can't believe you just said that.  But it's a comedy club.  I don't understand.  You wouldn't go, you wouldn't go to like, a strip joint and go, what kind of establishment  is this?  Boobs all over the place.  I swear to God, this is panorchy everywhere.  That's what it is.  It's a boob joint.  That's what it is.  You got to expect, you're going to hear some stuff.  You walked in there, right?  You'll see someone like Carlos Mencia.  But they're just jokes, though. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I know.  Like, I'm a professional.  I mean, this is what I do.  It's not like I'm some guy with a hood coming up going, where are all the niggers at?  I mean, that's different.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  I don't like that guy either.  It's not like I'm dragging people behind pickup trucks either.  I'm just telling jokes here.  But people get offended.  And with me, it's like everybody.  The Latin community is offended at me and some of the black community because I was doing  this joke about how there's a statistic, right? 
[01:34:00]  For every five white guys that do drugs, two blacks or two Hispanics, you know, ratio-wise.  So two Hispanics, five white guys, two blacks, five white guys.  But for every two black or Hispanics in jail, there's one white guy, right?  So my friend was arguing this point with me the other day.  So I went on stage and I'm like, listen, there's a reason for that.  And somebody yells out and goes, that's right, racism.  And some Mexican guy goes, yeah, that's right, racism.  And I said, well, I don't think so.  I think it's because when white people do drugs, they actually do it inside the house. 
[01:34:30]  They're smart enough to realize it's illegal to be doing this thing, man.  You know, they go, hey, Bubba, you want to smoke some?  Hell yeah.  Let's do it inside the house because somebody might see us.  Whereas to in our neighborhood, it's like, yo, dog, you want to shoot some off?  You know what? 
[01:35:00]  Let's do it outside, man, on the porch.  What are you doing, man?  You roll by these neighborhoods and it's like, you know, if there's more drugs being distributed in the white neighborhoods, that's fine.  But you can drive by any middle class white neighborhood in any borough that you want.  You know what I'm saying?  And you will not see a bunch of people run out of a corner and ask you what you want.  You know what I'm saying?  It's only in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods. 
[01:35:30]  If you drive slow there, all of a sudden, what you want?  Nothing, man.  I just got laws, bro.  Middle left, should have been right.  That's it, you know?  You can drive by a middle class neighborhood all you want, man.  Nobody's going to run out of the backyard, you know, holding a prog, whatever, the barbecue thing, talking about how much you want.  It ain't going to happen.  And there's a reason for that.  So you do a joke like that and all of a sudden, you know, you're anti, you're with the white people and, you know, you're anti us.  And why are you saying stuff like that?  And I'm like, because you should be smart.  If you're going to do something illegal, you dumbass, do it in the house, you know, like the corner. 
[01:36:00]  Did you guys see there's a thing called the corner on HBO?  Yeah, yeah.  They do movies about how we sell drugs and do them outside.  It's called the corner, not inside the house, in the bathroom, the corner, you know?  If that was a white guy doing drugs, it would be called, you know, in the closet.  It would be called in the closet.  In the bathroom.  In the basement, yeah.  Right, because their kids would have no idea.  See, when they do drugs about white people, the kids have no clue whatsoever that the white guys do drugs.  It was like, you know, like what was that movie where they brought, they brought, the doctors brought themselves back to life or something like that? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, wow.  Flatliners.  Flatliners.  Remember Flatliners where Julia Roberts, you know, she walks in and her dad's shooting up and he's like, oh, and she's, that would never be a, that would never be a Latino.  You know what I mean?  That, that, that wouldn't be us because we wouldn't be hiding, you know what I'm saying?  And then, and then you do jokes like that, that are real and honest and just, they're not even really jokes.  They're just realities that happen to be funny.  Observations.  Right?  And then all of a sudden people get a hair up their ass, you know, and you're the, you're the evil sellout. 
[01:37:00]  And, you know, to the white people, I'm the demon.  To the blacks and Hispanics, I'm a sellout.  To the Hindus, you know, I don't even know what the hell I am.  Let's go to your shows, Eskimos.  Well, I try, I try to help out, you know?  Like every once in a while, I say, Hindus, please come to my show.  I'm not, I haven't worn, you know, any deodorant for like a week.  So you guys are going to feel at home.  You know, you do something like that.  And then people go, why would you say that?  And I'm thinking, I don't know, maybe because when I'm walking down the street and one of them walks by, I go, God damn, what stinks, man? 
[01:37:30]  Who was that?  You know, when a Hasidic Jew looks around and goes, God damn, that was stinky.  That's when you know your ass needs to shower or something.  You know what I mean?  Like you got to adhere to some American rules.  You know what I mean?  Speed stick.  That's one of our little special rules.  That's just, you know, there's some things that you should just, you know, do a joke like that.  And everybody, everybody acts like you pulled it out of your ass, you know?  Yeah.  Where did it come from?  Like, where did it come from? 
[01:38:00]  Got to be based in some kind of reality.  And then I tell people, well, stereotypes are funny.  You know, stereotypes aren't true.  Oh, really?  We love stereotypes in this show.  But that's because they're true.  Right.  And if you don't believe me, you don't believe me that stereotypes are true.  If one stereotype is true, all stereotypes are true.  So go up to a black guy and ask him, do you like fried chicken?  He'll be like, hell no, man.  That's a stereotype.  All right.  I'm just checking.  You like watermelon.  That's another stereotype, man.  All right.  I'm just checking.  Is it true that all black men have large penises? 
[01:38:30]  Oh, you know, that's true.  That's true.  Well, if you got a big penis, you tap dance and love watermelon too, my brother.  Here's some fried chicken to go with that big ass penis of yours.  Do you know what I'm saying?  It's like, get one or the other, man.  You know, they're either real or not.  Don't pick and choose.  Like, this one's good for me, but these are not.  Come on, man.  I think we're going to get along just fine with Carlos Mencia.  Let's take a break, Carlos.  Talk, talk, talk, Opie. 
[01:39:00]  Talking out of one's butt crack.  Anthony.  Is a sign of personal confidence.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This show will really give your brain damage.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On 94.  W.  We're having you with Carlos Mencia.  Yeah.  We were talking about friends and tampons and heffing the fat chick for your friend. 
[01:39:30]  All that fun stuff during the break.  Sometimes you got to take the bullet.  Yeah.  So, you got to, man.  You know.  And the funny part is that you know when that moment happens.  As soon as your friend starts hitting on the cute chick, you just turn into wingman.  You know what I mean?  You just do, man.  You know.  He's Maverick.  You're a goose.  Get on it, bro.  You know what I'm saying?  It's all, you know.  And normally.  You know, see the cool thing about LA is that there's certain clubs where the ugly chick is still cool. 
[01:40:00]  You know what I'm saying?  But when I was younger, man.  And I used to go hang out like at just a regular schmo.  Oh, my God, dude.  There were some skankasauruses, man.  It was sad.  It was like the cute one and then her friend was like.  You know what I'm saying?  It was harsh, man.  I had to.  Man.  It's not even funny.  It was funny things I had to do for my friends.  It is not even cool, dude.  We've all been there, though, man.  You speak the truth, Carlos.  But, you know, it's like you were saying.  The cool part is, is like when they friends did it for me, you know, I still ragged on them after. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  You did the fat chick.  There's one moment.  There's like one real moment of like, dude, you're my bro.  You know that.  But right after that, it's like, can't believe you did a fat ass.  You know what I'm saying?  It's right.  You got to, man.  I mean, because, you know, that's ammunition you can't let go of.  And you're like, you're there, but I did the fat chick to do you a favor so you could  go home with the honey.  And now you're using it against me.  Yeah, but you have to because, you know, because it's there, man.  That's what chicks don't understand.  Like, chicks, you know, chicks don't, chicks are just mean to each other all around, dude. 
[01:41:00]  And chicks always, like, complain about guys.  That's the thing that gets me.  Like, I have 11 sisters.  I know.  Oh, that's true?  Oh, yeah.  I heard you talking about that on your CD.  I'm like, no way.  Oh, no, I really have 11 sisters and six brothers.  Really busting apart those stereotypes.  I told you, brother.  It's true.  Didn't I say it earlier?  18 kids, bro.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  You have 18 kids in your family?  Well, yeah.  11 sisters and six brothers.  And then it's me.  That's 18.  No, I did the math. 
[01:41:30]  Thank you.  Wow.  Well, you said no way.  I know, I know.  I was just shocked.  Why, dude?  18 kids.  Right.  I'm one of seven.  I thought that was a lot.  Well, it is a lot, dude.  Just because I have more doesn't mean yours is not a lot.  18 is a lot.  All right, whatever.  No, it is a lot, dude.  I agree.  Here's the cool part.  This is how cool my family is.  This is where I get my humor from.  I was in school one day, and we were doing this economics class, and we were studying about  social security. 
[01:42:00]  My mom was born in Mexico.  My dad was born in Honduras.  So they had a lot of kids because where they come from, there's no social security.  So they have a lot of kids open.  We make money, eventually taking care of them in the end.  That's pretty much everybody from an old country.  That's their state of mind.  So I go up to my dad.  I say, we're discussing this, dad, and blah, blah, blah, and I need to do a report on it.  So you're kind of the guy that we need to ask because you have so many kids.  And, you know, this was the theory behind what we thought, blah, blah, blah.  So I need to ask you, why so many, though? 
[01:42:30]  Why 18?  Was it because of, you know, what was the reason?  And my dad goes, oh, it's not that complicated.  Your mother just doesn't like to suck.  Wait a minute.  I swear to God, dude.  And my jaw dropped to the floor, dude.  I swear to God.  So then I go, so then I look at him seriously.  I go, dad, you know, thanks for, like, sharing a moment of, like, I'm trying to be, like, serious. 
[01:43:00]  I want to get an A in the report.  You know, thanks for helping out, you know.  I'm not going to put that in the report.  And then my dad goes, no, now you got to put it in.  If you ask me, you got to put it in.  I'm going to read it, and if it's not in there, I'm going to rip it up.  You got to put it in.  If you ask me, you got to put it in there.  I'm like, why do you want me to put it in there for?  You're sick, man.  He's sick.  And then he's like, because I want people to know, then they maybe tell her, and she changes.  Like, all of a sudden, people at school are going to be saying, you know, Mrs. Mencia doesn't prefer her. 
[01:43:30]  Like, that's going to happen, dad.  And then she's going to hear it someday, and eventually she's going to change.  Dude, dude, why don't you just ask her, bro?  You know?  God, man.  Dude, I have the funniest.  My family is so cool.  I mean, we're just so funny.  Everything was always funny.  There was never, you know, a moment where, like, when I was four years old, I got caught in gunfire outside my house. 
[01:44:00]  And it's really funny, right?  Stereotype bell going off.  Hey, bro, it's true, man.  I got caught.  I'm like four years old.  I got caught outside, and I couldn't move, but I could hear the bullets.  You can hear bullets, by the way, whiz in the air.  Yeah.  They make, like, a little, and really, they do.  So I'm there, and I'm facing the opposite direction of my house.  I'm about 30 feet from my house.  I slowly roll over and look at my mom, and she's, like, out in the door, but she doesn't come out because the bullets are flying. 
[01:44:30]  And then, anyway, the moment comes to pass, and blah, blah, blah.  And then one day, like, later on, you know, I was like, Mom, I remember that day that I was out there.  I, you know, I'm cool with it, but, you know, why don't you come out and, like, save me, man?  And my mom goes, hey, you're one of 18.  You're not special.  Oh, God.  And then she goes, and Manuel looks a lot like you, so I was like, I'm missing you. 
[01:45:00]  And I look over to my dad like a puppy with, like, a tear in his eye, and he goes, well, why'd you ask?  You know what she's going to say?  Oh, that's awful.  Dude, it's so, like, you know what I mean?  In my family, it's just everything was always, you know, make it funny, man.  Right, right.  Make it funny.  And the stereotypes, that's, to me, like, where a lot of this stuff comes from, you know what I mean?  Where the basis of it is stereotype.  Like, here's a stereotype.  White people hate to truly complain, except in New York when, you know, you're Jewish. 
[01:45:30]  But, like, just normal, everyday, average white Americans hate to complain.  Yeah.  Right?  Right.  And it's like, I don't know where it came from, but it did.  And that's why this whole election got screwed up, because those old white people, you know what I mean,  didn't want to complain, even though they knew when they left.  Because I was there in Miami, and I heard an interview on the radio where they asked an older Jewish guy,  who did you vote for?  And he actually said, I don't know, it was confusing. 
[01:46:00]  I hope I voted for Gore.  God damn.  I swear to God, right?  Yeah.  But they didn't complain that day.  And, see, I don't understand that, because in my culture, you complain.  Black people, man, if there was a ballot in the black part of Dade County that they didn't understand,  there would be a black guy still right now going, hell no, you can't close this, man.  Explain this to a nigga one more time.  In a bonnix, this is a east side and that's a west side. 
[01:46:30]  Let a brother know what's up, man.  You know, but the white people, it's like, we're going to send a fax and email our dissatisfaction to customer service.  You know, and like these old people, you know, we couldn't understand the ballot.  But, yeah, but when you go play bingo, your ass has 20 cards and you keep track of every single one.  Oh, and it's bingo time.  He can see you up through his ass.  You know what I mean?  All of a sudden, it's voting time.  Two sides.  Retard. 
[01:47:00]  So, anyway, that foundation, right, of that comes from this.  I'm with my friends at this place called Jack in the Box, which I don't think you guys have out here.  We used to have the Jack in the Box.  Oh, we got Jack in the Box.  Do we still have them on?  I think there's one or two left.  All right, so Jack in the Box.  We're right through Jack in the Box and the four of us, we order whatever, the burgers and the fries.  We're about two minutes away from the drive-thru.  I go, hey, where's my fries?  And my wife, oh, dude, they forgot them.  Don't worry about it.  Just have some of our fries.  I'm like, dude, no, I want my fries. 
[01:47:30]  I want your fries.  I paid for fries.  I want my fries.  Let's go back and get my fries.  Oh, dude, we're not going to go back, dude.  Whatever.  Just, you can have some of our fries.  And I'm like, listen, Ejo, I want my fries.  I want your fries.  See, I paid for my fries.  So then my wife, all right, you know what?  They forgot my fries.  No, we already established they were my fries.  They forgot.  So you can't go back and pretend they're yours.  See, I want my fries.  And so, anyway, like, anyway, I got pissed. 
[01:48:00]  They didn't go back.  And I realized that, for me, it was the opposite extreme.  When I was a kid, we used to go to Kentucky Fried Chicken once a month or two months, whatever.  It was like our big family outing.  And we would drive 20 minutes to go get food for 20 people, right?  Now, nobody liked macaroni and cheese except for my dad.  So he would order the little small thing of macaroni and cheese.  I remember one time, drove there, got our food, went back, put everything on the table.  Pati and my dad goes, hold up.  Where's the macaroni and cheese? 
[01:48:30]  And my mom goes, ay, mijo, I think they forgot it.  Put everything back in the bag.  But right now, we want to go back for the macaroni and cheese.  I swear to God, dude, he made us put the whole two buckets of 20, the whole thing for a little macaroni and cheese, dude.  And we're in the car looking at each other like, dude, our dad is a stone-cold wet-backed immigrant.  This is not even cool, man.  We speak English, bro. 
[01:49:00]  I got to go to school with some of the people that work at this place.  Unbelievable.  And my dad goes in, like, throws the thing and goes, where's the macaroni and cheese?  That's the first words out of his mouth.  And people looking at him funny, he's like, don't, you got a camera.  Go look at the camera.  I paid for the macaroni and cheese.  I drove 20 minutes, and now you got to give me more chicken.  You got to give me more chicken because you forgot the cheese.  Dude, and we're in the back going, oh, man, our dad is, oh, my God.  And, you know, he fulfilled that stereotype.  Man, I don't have a problem with that.  That's who he was, man. 
[01:49:30]  And part of that is me, too.  I just don't go that far with it.  You know what I mean?  That's funny.  There's so much on the line that works in on this.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, if you want to play stereotypes, the reason why us white folks don't complain is because we're too busy working.  That's funny.  But actually, you know what?  You guys don't stereotype, like, you guys don't work as hard as, like, immigrants.  Because immigrants, I mean, believe it or not, you can say white people work hard, but wherever you go in America, it doesn't matter now. 
[01:50:00]  It really, like, there used to be a day, and people who travel will tell you, there used to be a day when you traveled, you would probably, like, kind of know where you were going.  You know, if you were going to Miami, New York, or L.A., it would be ethnic, you know, Chicago.  But if you were going to, like, Birmingham, Alabama, it's pretty much white people.  Today, you can catch a flight to Birmingham, Alabama, and it looks like you're going to New York.  You know what I mean?  There's no, like, that thing is gone, man.  There's ethnicities are just everywhere.  And you don't realize it until, like, you know, Birmingham is probably the whitest city in the world, the most denoted racist city in the world. 
[01:50:30]  But at 9 o'clock in the morning, bro, at my hotel, bueno, he has keeping.  She was there, dude.  I don't know how she got there, bro.  I was talking to her, and she couldn't even say Birmingham.  I was like, you can't even say Birmingham.  She was just like, yeah, Birmingham.  I swear to God.  It was the funniest thing, man.  And you know what I mean?  So they work really hard.  But, see, I like the fact that the guy had the balls to call in and do that.  That's cool, man.  See, it's funny. 
[01:51:00]  We encourage that.  We encourage that on our show.  Dude, I love when people acknowledge that it's cool enough to tell jokes about each other.  Yeah, we like to think that.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, some people can't take a joke.  Well, yeah, but here's the thing.  Not that it affects us.  We don't care.  Well, but here's the thing.  Here's, like, this is the way I break it down, very simplistically.  If somebody were to drop a bomb, let's just name a country.  Let's just name Russia, or China.  Let's just name China.  If China tomorrow were to drop a bomb in Denver, all right, is there anybody in the city of New York, whatever ethnicity you are, that will not be willing to go to war against China? 
[01:51:30]  No.  So you're willing to die for each other, basically.  Everybody out there that's willing to fight for America is willing to preserve my right.  Carlos Vinci is right, as an American, to do and say whatever is constitutionally upheld.  So if you're willing to die for me, don't you think it would be nice if I let you tell a joke about my ass?  Do you know what I'm saying?  I mean, it's just, like, that simple.  I'm willing to die for you.  Tell a joke.  It's that simple for me. 
[01:52:00]  So if everybody gets a hair up their ass, I really don't care, because when push comes to shove, I'm there for you, dude.  We're family.  And so the reason why I do stereotypes is because they're not a big deal.  Now, if Mexico goes to war.  Oh, dude, I'll kill Mexicans.  In a heartbeat, bro.  Because I ain't a real Mexican, bro.  I mean, I'm only, like, you can call me a Mexican if you want, just because so you know that I grew up in L.A.  A Mexican-American.  Well, not even a Mexican-American.  I wish I was half, and then I only pay half my taxes, but that doesn't work out that way. 
[01:52:30]  I'm a Mexican-American, and then on April 15th, you're all American.  You know what I mean?  They don't give me that half rebate for the other half, you know, which I've totally been asking.  But they don't hook me up with that.  No, I mean, you know, I don't like that term, African-American.  You know, anybody who thinks they're African-American, I mean, unless you came from Africa, and even if you did, you left there because it sucked.  So right there, you're not African anymore.  But, like, people that grew up here, like, I'm African-American.  No, you're not, dude.  And I'm not Mexican, and I speak Spanish fluently, and I'm telling you I'm not a real Mexican. 
[01:53:00]  I will buy any black person that grew up here, all right, African-American, a ticket to Rwanda.  When you get off the plane and they look at your black ass and go, what, are you going to get a flashback?  What, are you going to remember?  That ain't going to happen, bro.  You're going to be like, that's what you're going to be like.  You know what I'm saying?  The Bronx is in the house.  That's what you're going to say.  I mean, let's just be honest.  You know what I mean?  Nobody wants to, like, admit.  Like, everybody wants to hate America now. 
[01:53:30]  Everybody.  You know what I mean?  Nobody wants to love it.  Black people want to hate it.  The Bronx want to hate it.  White people want to.  Like, they changed it too much.  They changed it too much.  You know?  Like, if you look at the voting patterns of America, it's like everybody who voted for  Gore, the little blue specks, were, like, all surrounding the coastline, right?  Yeah.  Because everybody, all the white people are, like, moving to the middle.  You know what I mean?  And they think that that's a smart thing to do, but then every year they come out and  get hit by tornadoes. 
[01:54:00]  And they will, we need help.  We got hit by a tornado again.  And these are the people that say, you know, black people don't even know how to spoke did  right.  You know, if I'm not mistaken, there is no R at the end of tornado, bubba.  You know what I'm saying?  Where did that happen?  You see, like, that stuff.  Everybody screws up English.  You know what I mean?  Like, people that pick on black people for Ebonics.  Everybody does it.  Hispanics do it.  You know what I mean? 
[01:54:30]  We make up words that aren't English or Spanish.  You know what I mean?  Like, we'll take the word push and take the word empujar, right?  And make puchar.  You know?  And only if you live here do you understand what that means.  But you think, you know, that's why we get bad grades in Spanish.  Because we think, I know Spanish.  And then we take it in high school.  A D?  How did I get a D?  You know what I mean?  And then your parents are like, how could you get a D?  You know what I mean?  Because you told me, pooch, I was a word.  It's your fault.  Not my fault.  You know what I mean?  You're pissed, you know?  And all of a sudden, they're the ones that taught you the heritage and they taught it to you screwed up. 
[01:55:00]  And you're the retard.  You know what I mean?  Everybody screws up.  Asians have the highest GPA in America.  But you go to one of their liquor stores and you still have to buy a lottery ticket.  Dude, what did you get in English?  Oh, in English.  A price.  A price.  Got you.  Did I get a lottery ticket?  Oh, are you fearing Rucky?  Whatever that is, dude.  Rucky. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, you know, this is funny, man.  Everybody screws up English.  Charlie, you want in on this or what?  I own a landscaping business.  You know what I'm doing?  That's great.  Here's the story about my dad.  Here's the story about my dad.  Speaking of landscaping, it was about, there's a place called Builders Emporium.  Went out of business.  Used to be the Home Depot where I grew up.  My father, at the time this happened, had a driver's license for a semi-truck.  Had a license to fly as a pilot. 
[01:56:00]  And was an engineer and a contractor.  All right?  By the time this happened, we're there.  And he's still, my dad's one of those guys that has an accent, but he speaks eloquently with an accent.  You know what I mean?  He's one of those guys that those are like this, but, you know, he brings out the big words, you know, because you have to be eloquent.  You know what I mean?  If you're not going to say, man, the people are not going to look at you.  You know, that's the kind of guy he is.  So, anyway.  Like Al Pacino from Cigar Face.  Yeah, something like that.  So, he goes in there.  We're walking in there.  And there used to be, like, immigrants that, you know, stayed outside to get work, basically. 
[01:56:30]  So, we're walking in, me and my dad.  And I'm like, I don't know, eight, nine years old.  And a white guy drives up in a pickup truck, and he goes, hey, senor, a pinto, a helso, mucho pinto, helso.  Right?  And my dad, I thought my dad was going to get pissed, right?  My father looks at him, and he goes, how many people you need?  And he goes, six people, $5 an hour.  My father goes, ¿guera mene? 
[01:57:00]  Don't go.  So, he walks over to where the illegal aliens are, and in Spanish says to him, I need six people, $5 an hour, get in the truck, I pay you right now.  And six dudes ran.  So, he gave them, you know, five bucks each, put them on the truck, walked up to the guy, there they go, you know.  And the guy was like, the guy had said, I'll give you 50 bucks to my dad.  So, then my dad goes, okay, they're right there, give me the $50.  The guy gave him the 50 bucks, and he left, right?  And I was like, dad, how come you didn't get mad?  And he goes, because I was the middle man.  He didn't know how to get to the people. 
[01:57:30]  I was the broker.  I took my percentage.  Now, we have 20 more dollars.  That's how you do it, baby.  You know what I mean?  And I was just like, wow, man.  He didn't get mad.  He took 20 bucks from this.  That was great, dude.  You know what I'm saying?  And so, like, it applied to me.  One time, I was at a mall.  This is a true story.  I'm walking out of a mall.  This guy comes up to me, and he goes, hey.  And in a matter-of-fact way, by the way.  He wasn't even, he was like the nicest guy.  He goes, hey, I lock my keys in my car.  You're Mexican.  You can get him out for me, can't you? 
[01:58:00]  And I wanted to get pissed, but I knew how to do it.  So, I was kind of stuck.  Do you know what I mean?  Do I pretend that I don't know how to do it, or do I just kind of go, well, you got the right beaner.  You know what I'm saying?  Reward him for his accuracy on picking the right one.  So, I walk up to his car, and I go, is this your car?  And he goes, yep.  And I broke his window.  And I go, well, there you go.  Go ahead.  Get your keys.  And the guy goes, how come you broke my window? 
[01:58:30]  And I go, because I don't have a Slim Jim.  Get in your car.  How we do it.  And I go, that's how we do it, bro.  I go, you better get in your car before I steal your stereo, because my instincts are starting to kick in, bro.  And I really did break his window, and the guy was pissed off, and I go, no, dude, I saved you money.  And he's like, I don't get it.  I go, listen, if you would have called the tow truck, he would have charged you 50 bucks, right, to open your door.  Around the corner, there's a guy named Manuel.  He works at this place called Instantry Glass.  Tell him Carlos sent you for 35 bucks. 
[01:59:00]  He'll clean it and vacuum it, and you'll save $15.  And the guy was like, really?  And he went over there and saved him the money.  But I really did break his window.  But it's like, you know, it was like my dad.  I could have taken his 50 bucks, you know what I mean, and then made the 15 and whatever.  You know, I want to do that.  But, I mean, for me, it's just like it's that simple, man.  You know, people want to get it out and be funny.  That's cool, man.  You know, I have a contracting business.  That's funny.  Because those are the people you want to hire.  Dude, if I had a contracting business, I would never hire an American.  Ever.  Ever. 
[01:59:30]  People that grew up here, you know what I'm saying?  You can't tell them to go up on the roof when it's windy.  You know what I'm saying?  Could you imagine telling them some Italian guy who grew up in Brooklyn?  You know, go up on a, hey, listen, I'll go up, but if I fall, I want you to know that  it's against the regulation section two of the court of the people that I work for.  So, if I fall, you're going to pay.  That's all I'm saying.  And then these are the type of people that will jump and break their ass because it's  your fault.  You know what I'm saying?  The wind died down here.  I don't know, but I fell because of the wind. 
[02:00:00]  You told me, now you owe me.  You know what I'm saying?  That's not what I want.  I want some dude who just got here from Nicaragua and go up on the roof.  But he's windy.  Well, I'm going to call Immigration and ask him how windy it is.  Oh, man, it's not that windy.  It's not that windy.  You didn't let me finish.  I was going to say, it's windy.  I need a rope.  That's what I was going to say.  To tie myself to the chimney so I don't fall.  But no, you got to have it on speed dial.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow.  It's funny, man.  You go with it.  It's cool.  Yeah, let's go to the phones here. 
[02:00:30]  Anthony, what's going on?  Oh, hey, what's up, man?  Carlos, you are killing me, my man.  You are the best.  Reality comedy.  Thanks, man.  There's not enough of that around, right, Anthony?  Oh, this guy is the best.  I was going to say Tony, but, you know, I don't want to feel like a Momo.  Seriously?  A Momo.  Dude, quick story.  Yeah.  I'm at the local, you know, Italian deli.  There's this little old lady in there buying stuff.  So I can't really do a Jewish lady's voice.  She goes, excuse me, do you know the difference between Pecorino and Locatelli? 
[02:01:00]  I was like, what, you assuming I'm Italian?  So, like, the Mexican guy knew the difference more than I did.  He goes, well, that one's a little sharper and that one's weak.  I was like, there you go.  That one's a little sharper?  Carlos, you're the man, dude.  Tony is show, my man.  All right.  Later.  A little sharper.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Hey, look, the CD, the name of my CD, by the way, is called Take a Joke America.  It's on Warner Brothers Records.  It should be out at your record stores everywhere.  And if not, you could go to carlosmencia.com.  Yeah, that's it.  I was about to give you my email address.  That would be smart.  I was like, isn't that at something?  No, that's not it.  Yeah, carlosmencia.com.  Check it out.  There's some cool stuff, man.  This has been a lot of fun.  You've got to come back.  Hell, yeah.  And see us again, man.  Oh, dude, of course.  Man.  This is the perfect show for you.  I'm telling you, carlos.  This is it right here.  Oh, bro.  You do a lot of radio around the country? 
[02:02:00]  I do so much radio, it hurts.  Here's what happens.  They say, do whatever you want.  And then, you know what?  I'll go up on stage.  That's exactly what we told them today.  And I'll go up on stage and say the word nigga.  You know what I mean?  And all of a sudden, you can just hear the room just go, just quiet.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, you know, black people are going to get mad.  You can't say that word.  You know?  Because people have told me, you can't, you can't. 
[02:02:30]  I had a black guy one time tell me that.  You can't say the word nigga.  I said, well, I'll stop saying nigga when my black friends stop calling me one.  What's up with that?  You know, I thought I was a spig.  I hang out with my black friends.  What's up, nigga?  Oh, that too.  Damn.  Can I be more minority?  Gene, call me a chink and I'll kill myself.  I'll never get a job.  But you know what I mean?  How retarded is that?  If somebody calls me, you know, what's up, nigga?  I'm going to respond.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's like, how stupid are people that now, like, when you listen to radios, especially 
[02:03:00]  like hip-hop stations, they bleep out the word nigga as if the guy's trying to say  nigger, which are two completely different words.  Everybody knows that.  Yeah.  Nigga, nigger.  Nigga, you're my boy.  You're my dog.  You're cool.  Nigga, you either want to get your ass beat or you got backup.  One or the other.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  That's just one or the other, bro.  That, you know, and there are people out in America that want to pretend like they don't  know the difference. 
[02:03:30]  You know, and that's the kind of stuff that kills me where you go to, like, the Midwest.  See, that's the problem.  How come you can say nigger and black people say nigger, but when I call a nigger a nigger,  I'm an aye-ho.  Because you're retarded.  You get hit by a tornado every year and you don't move.  Isn't that cool?  You live in Tornado Alley, for Christ's sake.  It's not even that difficult for you to move.  Your house has wheels, you dumbass.  Drive away, retard. 
[02:04:00]  Anyway, with that, we're going to let you go.  It's Carlos Mencia.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, this is Stalker Patty, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 94 WYSB.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:04:30]  Some free phone lines available at 877-692-1027.  It's like a telethon, this show.  Hey, we got some free phone lines.  Call them now.  I got to go to Jason real fast here.  All right.  He may have a good idea for the show. 
[02:05:00]  Jason, what's up?  Opie.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  What up?  Welcome to Philly.  We love you down here.  Oh, thank you.  Got a great idea for you.  Okay.  Tourette's karaoke.  Tourette's karaoke.  Nice.  Tourette's karaoke.  Nice.  Paul, but we need someone with, like, severe Tourette's.  Imagine someone with Tourette's singing, like, a love song and just losing it.  Like that Gwyneth Paltrow karaoke movie.  You could sing the same song Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis sang. 
[02:05:30]  Didn't you hear that one?  You didn't see that god-awful movie?  When I was on the cruise, they were playing it in the rooms.  I swear to God, I was on in the background.  Oh, God, I just hung myself.  I know.  Okay.  Let the abuse start.  Go ahead.  I'm not even going to.  I won't even defend myself.  You watched that little faggot movie.  What movie was it?  I don't even remember the name of it.  I swear to God.  It was raining that day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was pouring rain.  God, I'm screwed. 
[02:06:00]  What did I do?  We should say that Jim Brewer is here.  Brewer, faggot.  He had so much fun the other day.  He said, what the hell?  I'm coming back.  I never left so hard in my life.  Wasn't that fun?  The whooping monkeys killed me.  We had a pisser the other day, man.  A lot of fun.  That was jackass rocking on.  Yeah.  Hey, should we invite the Reekans and the Jamaicans into the studio?  Oh, Jesus.  Now, hold on a second.  You did not tell me we'd be dealing with that today.  I am not ready for a situation where we got... 
[02:06:30]  We have, like, uh...  Oh, for crazy now.  It's like...  It's the Rainbow Coalition in here.  Wow.  Not Earl.  Earl.  Earl's the white guy.  Bobby Bonilla.  Yes.  Bobby Bonilla.  Bobby Bonilla.  What's up, Bobby?  Well, let's get your mic and mic in here.  Yeah.  And Angel, the angry Puerto Rican.  Angel is one of the most angry Puerto Rican guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Serious. 
[02:07:00]  He just got out of jail.  He just got out of jail for protesting the bombing of Vieques in Puerto Rico.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  This guy is hardcore Puerto Rican, man.  I'm a white, bro.  Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, he doesn't even want to shake hands with the white guy.  I've never seen a whiter person than this dude.  Jim Brewer?  Do you think Jim Brewer's really white?  Talk about Casper.  He's Wonder Bread, y'all.  Big time.  Welcome back to the free world, man.  You were in jail.  What happened, Hammer? 
[02:07:30]  What'd you do?  Look at him with his Puerto Rican hat on.  He's got his Puerto Rican flag.  Drinking his Corona.  Look, he's got to put the Puerto Rican flag over the mic.  What do you got to say that for?  How long were you in jail for, Angel?  Why are you bending your overlay?  Shut up, dick.  How long were you in jail?  Uh, about six months, because I couldn't afford the bail.  Six months?  What was bail to get out of jail there?  Three dollars.  Oh, man, sure. 
[02:08:00]  I love when Whitey snaps on us.  How much was bail, though, to get out?  You were protesting.  You were on a restricted area.  What happened?  Well, I went over there with a group of people protesting with a situation that, you know,  Whitey's blowing up my country.  Well, so, you know, we've got to practice dropping bombs somewhere.  Why am I island?  Why don't you do it in Long Island?  That's an island, right?  What, Long Island?  All right, we'll do it over Winder.  Yeah, no argument here.  We'll do it over Brentwood. 
[02:08:30]  Right, if you can take out Brentwood and Winder, sure.  Why not?  Oh, God, man.  Why don't you speak up?  Why don't you represent?  He's Jamaican.  We're in the same boat.  We're not bombing Jamaica.  His people's oppressed, too.  Why are you saying the black guy's in the same boat as the Puerto Rican?  No, we're not in the same boat.  Why?  It's a different boat.  Oh, because you supplied the weed, right?  It's a different boat.  The only bombers in Jamaica are the ones you're smoking.  The big, fat bomber.  Hey, look, they wouldn't do that in Jamaica.  We're a little bit different over there.  You know that.  Well, anyway, I got arrested by a bunch of, again, white people.  White people arresting you. 
[02:09:00]  Were they military personnel arresting you?  Yes, and then you do get stripped shirt.  Did you pass any signs that said restricted area, you do not go in here?  It was in English, so.  Hey, it was in English.  Hey.  You're having Spanish signs in the same thing.  Isn't Vieques a part of Puerto Rico that really isn't being used for anything?  That's people that, yo, we grow avocados.  We supply half of you guys.  We're blowing up avocados on Vieques.  We don't need avocados that bad. 
[02:09:30]  I think if the Puerto Rican avocado supply dried up, we would still be a world power.  Okay.  Jesus, man.  So, they haul you away.  They tell you your bail is how much?  Don't berate it anyway.  Oh, that prickle.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  You use that kind of language?  So, you use that kind of language. 
[02:10:00]  So, how much was bad?  I want to know.  Six grand.  Six thousand dollars because you tread on restricted ground.  Yeah, and plus I started using profanity to the cops and everything.  See?  And, you know, I didn't want to be in jail, so I started making a ruckus inside.  Well, to not be in jail, you don't make a ruckus.  You weren't all involved?  No.  You weren't drinking the Coronas out there on the bombing range?  No.  But here's the cops, Puerto Ricans?  No, over there, no.  Oh.  No?  No, dominated.  You see, but we're under the control of you guys. 
[02:10:30]  You guys tell us to jump.  We got to jump.  We're under your payroll.  You could break away.  You could break away.  Who said all you want?  Hey, look.  He's a black guy.  You got a black guy.  Hey, you got a black guy.  Hey, check this out.  We are the blue.  We are the chili.  Yeah, man.  Check this out.  We used to be under the British.  Jamaica used to be under the British.  We'll break away, man.  Independent.  Move on.  Now there's hedonism and all kinds of fun stuff going on.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Rock, Jamaica. 
[02:11:00]  Jamaica rocks.  That's what I'm saying, man.  You don't got to take that.  You're damn right, but they're blowing our cell.  No, no, no.  They're throwing a missile at us.  What's that all about?  Leave us alone.  They're not bombing the capital.  They're not bombing towns.  It's a bombing range.  Yeah, they're just trying to improve the area.  Look at Nevada.  There's a whole state we bomb all the time because there's nothing going on in Nevada.  Speak up, Rick.  It's just a piece of land used as a bombing range.  So what happened to you in jail? 
[02:11:30]  It's a little depleted uranium.  Well, you know, I had to fight people off, you know.  Did you?  Now, I heard you got strip searched.  Yes, yes.  When you went in.  Yes.  A cavity search.  How's that?  Not too good.  Not too good.  I don't recommend it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Okay, nice.  Oh, wait.  No, first they had to.  They did use a little lube, so it wouldn't hurt so much.  He's spitting.  He couldn't take that one.  That hit a little too close to home.  All right.  I reminisced.  We just found out he's not a swallower.  Spitting the beer all over the studio.  He's not a swallower.  So how'd you get out?  You just, like, served your time?  Yeah, I served my time, and I'm on community service and everything, so I'm not allowed to 
[02:12:30]  ever do that again.  But I went to protest on your fellow brother, Al Sharpton.  Fellow brother?  Al Sharpton's Jamaican.  I didn't know Al Sharpton.  You're lumping every black guy into...  He's black.  He's black.  Well, he's black.  Same thing.  So?  I've got nothing to do with him.  Yeah, there's different black people.  Yeah, there's different.  Right.  Oh, you got black, but you're brainwashed.  By who?  By whitey.  Hey, Jamaica's a...  You brainwashed.  You got brainwashed.  Not only black girls are brainwashed, but you got Jamaican...  What's your name? 
[02:13:00]  Look here.  Jamaica Mike.  Jamaica Mike.  Hey, Jamaica's a hundred percent black.  A hundred percent black, kid.  Remember that.  Did you read?  We run that place.  The government doesn't want nobody visiting Jamaica right now?  Oh?  Jamaica's nice, man.  Jamaica's nice, kid.  Go there, you smoke some weed.  We always be nice.  Number one...  Huh?  Jamaica's being bombed right now.  By who?  By your own people.  We're not bombing, man.  We're just knocking out a few people.  I'm not talking about Jamaica, man.  Just a few people got to get knocked.  You're just knocking out a few people.  Free Puerto Rico.  Free Puerto Rico now.  Angel.  Free Puerto Rico.  Yeah, free...  Why don't you live in Puerto Rico? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to create some kind of movement here.  I want my own currency.  I want my own state.  I want my own...  Listen...  Al Sharpton could do that for you.  Riverdale.  Riverdale.  I want my own currency, too.  Thank you for checking in, Al.  I got to buy a new big hubcap medallion.  Hey, made out of gold.  I want my own currency, too.  It's called Keep Away From The You Know What.  That's worth at least $1,000 in my book, Hotshot.  Now, where's your donkey for a puppy in a snot box? 
[02:14:00]  This is America.  Now, wake up or get off the toilet.  You want, like, a completely different, independent Puerto Rico.  You damn skit.  So go to Puerto Rico and become, like, a...  But I have to start the movement here.  Why?  Because this is where the oppression starts.  No one cares in America.  The oppression?  They don't give up.  This, people, if we call them, man.  This is stupid, man.  No, no, no.  Don't do this thing, man.  No, no, no.  Let's stop it, man.  Come on, English.  Give us some English around here.  What the hell is that? 
[02:14:30]  Give us some English around here.  Come on.  God, man.  Yeah, even the Jamaican guy speaks English.  God, you could turn off the light, honestly, man.  You guys would glow in here.  How white you guys are here.  Wider than white.  You're like a bunny rabbit.  Well, it didn't work out for you in the protesting.  Hey, the struggle keeps on.  Are you back at work? 
[02:15:00]  Filling applications.  Wait a minute.  You're taking advantage of America?  America, how are you paying your bills if you don't have a job right now?  By that damn U.S. dollar.  Damn the U.S. dollar.  Unemployment?  Are you on unemployment?  It's called government assistance.  Well, the oppressive government is assisting you.  You're being a hypocrite.  He who asks is taking.  You have no problem taking the handouts.  No.  I like the paper money.  You could go down to Puerto Rico and work there and work to make Puerto Rico. 
[02:15:30]  You could maybe be a leader down there or something.  Get an uprising going.  I'm trying to start it here.  Well, you're not going to work here.  No one cares.  We go down there for vacation.  He's doing a great job by handing out the coronas to everyone.  There you go.  Where's mine?  He's going to be our first spokesman right here.  Right here.  Let me tell you something about it.  Listen, all 40 of you Puerto Ricans here in New York City and the three of you and the rest of the country, hell, I'm with you. 
[02:16:00]  Let's free you and maybe you go home for crying out loud and take my goddamn wife with you, hot shot, because this is America.  I'm going to go play with my donkey.  Now, shut up.  Oh, look who joins the party now.  It's a Hispanic love fest.  Now, Old Dirty just came in.  Now, Old Dirty's Dominican, y'all.  Old Dirty's Dominican.  We got Dominican.  We got a Puerto Rican.  We got a Jamaican. 
[02:16:30]  That's it.  We're just white bread munch.  What are you talking about Dan Adams for?  It's Corona right there.  Yeah, right here.  This is what I drink right here.  Old Dirty.  What up, what up, baby?  Jesus Christ, there's more than you see in the hotel housekeeping department here.  More Hispanics, man.  Look at that.  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  Old Dirty, man.  Don't stop.  Don't show him the love.  The brother's misdirected. 
[02:17:00]  Angel's a little misdirected.  He's a little bitter at America for some reason.  Bitter ain't the word.  What you collecting, son?  What program are you on?  What program are you on?  Yo, what program are you on?  What you on, man?  How many programs are there?  You on New England?  There's actually five programs out there.  Old Dirty, what are the programs?  Hold on, hold on.  Let me ask Anthony.  Did you know there were five programs?  I didn't even know.  All I've ever used was unemployment.  Five programs that you guys are paying.  All I've used ever was unemployment. 
[02:17:30]  That's pretty much it when I was out of work.  What are the five programs?  There's unemployment, SSI, welfare, disability.  What was the last one?  Oh, yeah, they give you a one-shot deal.  So I can lose your apartment.  That's it, yo.  I want to live in America.  Hold on, hold on.  What's the one-shot deal?  What's the one-shot deal?  Hold on.  All right, you show up to the office.  Sometimes you want to get Wilfredo. 
[02:18:00]  That's what we call welfare.  Wilfredo?  You call welfare Wilfredo?  Yeah, Willie.  He's got a name.  Yo, where's Willie?  Big Willie.  It's called Big Willie.  Big Willie?  God, I hate you, guys.  Oh, no, Big Willie.  Like, if somebody asks you, where you going?  Nah, I got to go see Willie.  Mm-hmm.  I got to go see Big Willie.  So sometimes, you know, you got to go down and be like, yo, I'm going to lose my place.  Right.  So sometimes they, if you don't get the welfare, then you get the one-shot deal.  Can't wait for August 5th.  How's the, what's this one-shot?  Who came up with the one-shot deal?  So then you fill out the paperwork, then you go home and get all your receipts ready. 
[02:18:30]  I mean, even if you got, like, behind two months, you come in with, like, six months behind.  Right.  And they make you off for, like, $1,500, $1,700.  And they pay off everything.  Right there, dude.  Bills, light bill, cable, everything.  What?  To you by Uncle Sam.  Who the hell is the guy that legislated that piece of crap?  Who's the politician that slid that one under the wire?  August 5th, I get brand new.  August 5th.  It's called Family First Card, by the way.  What is it?  Remember they used to do the components? 
[02:19:00]  Yes, son.  So dollar bills?  Now they put in a credit card.  They put in a credit card.  What is it?  They put in a credit card.  You go in the supermarket, all you got to do is take your Family First Card.  Yeah.  And then they just deduct it off your account.  And what's this account?  Where's the money coming from in the account?  From your people's dollars.  Oh, my God.  You notice all the white guys in the room?  We don't have a clue.  We're all staring like deers caught in headlights.  Like a retard looking at a Ferris wheel.  What the F is going on?  It's a Family First Card. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, look at your pay stub.  Oh, God.  Look at your pay stub.  This son of a bitch.  Look at your pay stub.  Look at your pay stub.  Family First, not my family.  Sorry.  You got to learn how to find out these little gems.  Now, do you buy this stuff with a Family First Card and then maybe sell some of it?  Oh, Big Willie gives it to you.  Yes, sir.  Big Willie, you go in and then you apply and boom, they give it to you.  Big Willie.  Yeah, Will.  That's it.  Willie Will.  Who is the dirtbag politician that came up with this crap? 
[02:20:00]  We don't pay rent.  We just got to say, hey, I got a leak in my bathroom.  I'm not paying rent.  That's the best.  You know that?  Nah, son.  Come on.  What?  What do you do?  You got to get the whole building down.  You got to get the whole building down.  So what does that entail, Old Dirty?  Oh, sometimes, you know, like if there's conditions in the building that are not livable.  Right.  But then, you know, you got to put the whole, like a little group together, all the tenants.  And then they bitch that the landlord is a slumlord or something. 
[02:20:30]  Then you go to court and everybody decides right there in the lobby.  And the best thing is when you get roaches.  Oh, nah, but roaches ain't nice, huh?  That's what he's eating.  That ain't nice.  So now, while this whole case is going on, you don't pay rent.  Nobody paying rent until the landlord repairs the building.  And who's paying for this court time?  Well, the city and the state, they got to absorb those costs, my brother.  What you think you paying taxes for?  Section 8.  Nah. 
[02:21:00]  Section 8.  Section 8.  You could go in Section 8 and they give you a fat, what, fat, I can say ass?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fat ass apartment, Section 8.  Yes or no?  So my man got a deep lake on the west side.  Got something on the west side.  So Opie, if you need a place to stay.  You got all this going on and you're pissed because we're bombing a stupid island in the middle of nowhere.  Don't say stupid island.  You bastard.  Don't say stupid island, bro.  I think we're more than even right now.  A little bit.  A little bit.  On the real, man.  Drinks around the house. 
[02:21:30]  I want to fly over Puerto Rico and drop you on your head.  Miss Vieques and just, oh my God.  Yo, look at your pay stuff.  Look at your pay stuff.  He goes, look at your pay stuff.  S-U-I?  I mean, seriously.  S-U-I?  There's certain segments of the population that don't push up.  What do you do now if you get hurt or something and you need to maybe go medical attention?  Who pays for that?  What are you talking about?  An emergency room trauma?  Yeah, what happens?  I give it to a guy. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, what?  Hold on.  Let's all do a car.  I always give a fake name when I go to emergency rooms, son.  You give a fake name?  Look at these two.  They're high-fiving each other.  What's your name?  Who's they remember?  And then tomorrow you're going to Lincoln.  Lincoln and I sit over there.  What's your name?  It's Carlos.  And they'll treat you.  They got to treat you, right?  Yes or no.  They have to.  Then you put them.  They just put down, like, Opie's address and everything.  And they send them the bill.  I live in Huntington, kid.  Oh, my God. 
[02:22:30]  Cool.  I'm telling you.  Unbelievable.  I've been out there like that, son.  Sometimes you don't even have to do that.  I am being educated.  When I came back from American Airlines, everybody in the plane, yes or no, when they come from  Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico, everybody, when they, we're approaching JFK.  It's a party, kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't see it.  I want to live in America.  Everybody, yes or no, everybody's such classy.  Yo, the first address, thank you.  Well, now that you're here, you won't be needing your own home. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Welcome to America, Pedro.  Yo, the first address, you won't be needing your own home.  Yo, the first address, you won't be needing your own home.  I haven't pulled an emergency room like in two years.  See, you guys, George Bush has listened to your show.  Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.  Right.  These goddamn wetbacks are out there partying up. 
[02:23:30]  Well, they got a home.  Well, tell you what, nowhere to go now, Pablo.  Oh, my God.  I need to pray.  I want to ride one of those bombs down, like, what's his name, from Slim Pickens.  I thought sneaking in three of my friends into the Met game with a box ticket was, like,  really bad.  These guys, you guys are living large off of the tax dollars.  Oh, not me.  Hey, I'm working. 
[02:24:00]  You guys got all the scams going.  What are you working?  You're not working again.  I'm an independent contractor.  Spell drug dealer.  I'm a speech motivator.  I'm into communications, man.  Oh, communications.  You're selling stolen cell phones.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Not like that.  We're providing a service to the community.  It's all for the cause.  It's all for the cause.  Jim Brewer, after hearing these guys go at it, he goes, hey, I'll be right back.  He comes back in the studio with his possessions and his knapsack. 
[02:24:30]  I was hoping they had a gun in there.  Jim, is this your keys?  No.  All right.  All right.  We got it.  The Enola Gay is leaving the tarmac, bound for Puerto Rico.  Her deadly cargo.  The atomic bomb in her belly as she rolls out on the tarmac.  The Enola Gay.  That's what I want to hear.  Man, I am getting pissed.  I need bomber aircraft.  You're getting pissed.  The Enola Gay flying over Puerto Rico.  Here we go.  Free water.  Ah! 
[02:25:00]  Man.  I hit this almost on.  All right.  Great.  All right, Dan.  I guess we'll take a break.  One guy in Philly's on the line.  He says, I'm never listening to you guys again.  He's that pissed off.  Mike, what's up?  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  I'm from Philly, man.  You guys rock.  Get these guys.  Kick these guys out of the studio right now.  You know, the sad part is, though, this is reality.  I didn't know this crap was going on.  I didn't know they knew all the scams.  Oh, man. 
[02:25:30]  They're laughing about it.  They're laughing in our face.  Yeah, hell yeah, they are.  Get them out of there.  Kick them.  Opie, physically kick them out of that studio.  Look, he already knows.  Then I could go on disability.  Yeah!  See?  Yeah!  You know, I wish I didn't live in Philly.  I'd be down there kicking their sorry ass.  I'd do it for the benefits.  I'd do it for the benefits.  Wow.  Uh, we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crack pipes and your beer bombs and pay attention. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I'm a virgin.  Hey!  The Opie and Anthony show.  A four-hour parade of meat.  YSP.  Hey, it's the Retired of Laverne and Shirley.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 94 WISP. 
[02:26:30]  Huge earthquake in Seattle.  News.  Oh, yes.  Breaking news.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Seattle rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake.  And that's about it.  They were showing some footage on TV.  Yeah.  The best was, uh, they have video of some news conference, right? 
[02:27:00]  They were getting ready for a news conference out there?  It was a press conference.  Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, was giving a speech.  Wasn't it two separate things?  Yeah, they had a couple of different news things.  I'm talking about the one where it was a bunch of people in one room.  Oh, yeah.  Waiting for someone to speak.  They have them on camera.  And all of a sudden, the guy just starts freaking out because the earthquake is happening.  It's pretty cool because what you saw was, and they'll probably show this a thousand times on the news.  Uh, you see people just going about their business, setting up their cameras, setting up the mics, and then you notice, like, it's shaking a little. 
[02:27:30]  But no one really took note because they just kind of started looking around like in the, what, what is that kind of thing?  What the F?  But then it just goes, wham, and starts shaking.  And one reporter goes, damn it!  And holds on to a piece of the wall, and the camera's right on him.  And he has the most scared, S-less look on his face.  And then, not that you can blame him.  And then it stops shaking.  And it was hilarious.  Everyone ran to the window. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And Opie made a little observation.  I'm like, you can't see an earthquake.  Why are you running to the window?  I ran to the window.  Hey, there it is.  There it goes.  Someone catch it.  It's an earthquake.  Hey, there it goes.  You see it?  It's just kind of fading away over the hills there.  Bill Gates blew it, though.  You see his press conference?  They had a camera on the stage.  Big stage.  You know, one of these big, not to interrupt, but this is a second piece of video they got where they're in a huge auditorium.  Big auditorium.  Bill Gates on stage, ready to give a speech like he always does, head of Microsoft. 
[02:28:30]  And he blew a good chance there.  A huge opportunity.  Because it starts really shaking.  Lights are falling on top of the audience, off of the stage.  You could see the lights kind of popping as they hit the stage.  And the audience is getting up panicked and trying to run to the exits.  Pretty awesome scene.  Yeah, it was cool.  Bill Gates missed his opportunity to just stand up, open his arms to the crowd and go,  Behold the power of Microsoft! 
[02:29:00]  How dare you try to divvy up my company!  Fear me!  No!  Fear me!  I am Bill Gates.  I make the earth shake with Microsoft.  He missed his opportunity.  True.  You know what?  You know what?  People would have turned around and gone, holy yes, we better listen to this guy.  Anyway, Anthony, the earthquake was a 7.0.  Yeah, that's a biggie. 
[02:29:30]  I got a friend who does a talk show, same time we're on.  We're trying to get a hold of him, but he can't call Seattle right now for some reason.  I guess a lot of the phone lines might be down or busy.  Yeah.  A lot of busy signals when you have an earthquake.  It was no, from the damage I was watching on the news, it was no San Francisco earthquake.  No, it was no, you know, the highway just collapsed and pancaked 250 cars.  Nothing like that.  Nothing like that.  Just a few bricks falling. 
[02:30:00]  I saw a lot of walls down on top of some cars.  There was fire on a roof.  Yeah.  Firemen went up with fire extinguishers.  Didn't even need the hoses or anything.  We should get Earl on the radio today.  Earl is like, oh, God, we're talking about earthquakes and stuff, and Earl goes, you know, they say  that a piece of California is going to just kind of break away and float away.  Drift off into the ocean.  Drift off.  Earl, do you know anything about the earth?  It's not like we're just on these floating pieces of dirt on the water. 
[02:30:30]  I'm sure it's going to drift away eventually, but when they mean drift away, they mean it's  going to take about, I don't know, 278,000 years.  Perhaps even millions of years.  Yeah, exactly.  Where the plates move.  But Earl's logic, it's like all of a sudden, you know, we're part of California.  Next thing you know, we're just kind of drifting away.  Drifting off.  If you get up for work that morning, you're driving, all of a sudden the road ends.  You go, hey, how am I going to get to work? 
[02:31:00]  There's an ocean here.  All of a sudden, my commute was twice as long, and there was a lot of water in between me  and work.  I didn't know what to do, so I just went home and went back to sleep.  Didn't that happen today?  Because that's exactly what I did.  This drifting away crap continues to happen all around us.  Things are drifting away all the time.  What do you want on this fault line?  Anthony brings up a good point.  Like, Long Island, it's a safe bet that it was attached to Manhattan.  Yeah, at some point, it was all dirt.  But it's kind of drifting away.  Now, you know, what do we do? 
[02:31:30]  Did we freak out?  No, you build a bridge.  You just build a bridge.  It's not like we're cavemen and it starts drifting away and there's nothing we can do about it.  You know, at one point, there was just glacier covering this and people moved on.  Right.  They took their loincloths, their families, and their little obsidian spears and went south.  Earl, so what did you hear?  California's going to drift away?  No.  It's the white man's fault, isn't it, Earl?  No.  Oh.  We blame it on us.  All I said was that...  Hey, let's play Dobie Gray, drift away for Earl. 
[02:32:00]  What do you say?  Like old times.  What are you trying to say?  No, I said, isn't it...  At one point, there's going to be an earthquake that will completely destroy the West Coast.  Or most of it.  I'm absolutely right.  I am absolutely right.  It's Earl from the future.  You laugh at me now, but you wait 30 years from now.  You're going to see what happened to California.  The entire West Coast will be destroyed by...  I didn't say like tomorrow.  I mean like...  When? 
[02:32:30]  You know, it could be a million years from now.  I don't know.  Blackbird for the future, a million years from now.  Oh my God, we're still oppressed.  There's no observation.  An observation.  An observation.  That it's just going to, if I could say, drift away.  Do you watch the Discovery Channel at all, Earl?  No.  Do you watch anything about the mechanics of our fine planet Earth?  I know how it works.  I know how that works. 
[02:33:00]  It was just the hand of the same.  It doesn't just crumble and fall off.  It's just a figure of speech.  The Earth is a constantly changing thing.  I understand this.  It's always moving and changing.  If you look at the geography of this planet from millions of years ago, you wouldn't even recognize the country's incompetence.  And just because we're here doesn't mean it stops. 
[02:33:30]  It's a slow-moving thing.  At one point, your home of Africa was butted right up against South America.  Yeah, I know that.  And Florida was part of it.  And then it moves, Earl.  It didn't happen overnight.  I didn't say it would happen overnight.  Earl, is the whole California West Coast thing going to drift away like one of those balls when the kid is playing in the shallow end and the ball just kind of drifts away into the deep end?  And there's nothing he can do about it. 
[02:34:00]  The kid's screwed.  You try to do an oar thing in the water.  Like, that's going to help.  Not touching the ball, but I'm making the water come toward me.  Maybe we could get all those Mexicans at the same time and do that thing with the water to bring it back.  That's all we need.  Bring it back around.  It happens over a long time.  It's basically Mother Nature just, like, scratching her balloon knot.  Right.  She had a little itch.  That's what it is. 
[02:34:30]  It's a little it's so insignificant if you look at it on a planetary scale.  But us people, we're so self-important.  The human race, so self-important.  It's like a big deal.  And they try to predict all these things.  Ain't going to happen.  We're just another organism temporarily on this planet until whatever powers may be decide they've had enough.  Hey, you're off.  You think we could, like, tie a big rope to the West Coast so it doesn't drift away?  How about that? 
[02:35:00]  What do you think?  Big rope?  We got the Mexicans for it.  You ever see when they get a bunch of Mexicans on the landscaping truck and they're holding each other and they're on top of the grass clippings to hold it down?  Why don't we just do that?  We'll have them over the fault line like this big, giant Mexican net.  They could hold a cactus on one side and a bush on the other.  I'm here.  This is helping.  And it's okay because they give me benefits. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Ron, what's going on?  Oh, hey, you guys are killing me, man.  I used to live out in Los Angeles.  And then we were talking about people running through the windows.  Yeah.  I experienced an earthquake.  It's called a wave earthquake where the ground does like a water wave.  Yeah.  I mean, the houses and everything are doing it.  And I woke up.  I'm like, oh, shit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I went running through the window and I looked down.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Where am I going?  The Earth is moving.  What am I going to go up the window for?  He just brought that back and it made me laugh. 
[02:36:00]  And then he talked about the Mother Nature scratched her balloon knot.  Her balloon knot.  That's it, you know.  Scratching her balloon knot.  You ever get an itch?  You know, you get an itch, you got to dig a little.  You got to dig a little.  You guys real, man.  Talk to you later.  All right, Ron.  That's the same thing.  If I may transfer the magnitude into something you can understand.  It's a 7.0.  That is exactly 12.1 nigger watts of energy. 
[02:36:30]  Manny, what's going on?  Oh, what a day.  What's happening, guys?  All right.  I want to ask her a couple questions.  First, does he know if California breaks off, we've got union workers that can weld that back together?  Yeah, we've done wonders with steel these days.  Second of all, is New York going to become like escaping New York in a movie, too?  Oh, man.  But Earl was just talking about how it's just going to drift away.  Just like Hawaii did.  I heard Hawaii was connected.  Well, there you go.  Then we're going to have to take a flight to see the shoreline. 
[02:37:00]  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  All right, buddy.  Be good.  Charles has something good here.  Charles, what's up?  Charles.  Charles.  Hey.  Charles.  Charles.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  He wanted to know, Earl, if the part that breaks away from California, if we could call it Wilson.  Rename that part of the country Wilson. 
[02:37:30]  A little castaway reference.  See, Charles, that was brilliant.  Where were you?  Very good.  How to take your line.  Yeah, we are very self-absorbed, self-important.  This planet will do whatever it pleases with us.  Like, people always bitching that we're destroying the planet, save the Earth and stuff.  I think, I think, who did a bit on that?  George Carlin was doing something on this.  And he's so right about it.  You know, there's no saving the Earth. 
[02:38:00]  It doesn't matter how much garbage you throw out of something.  Yeah, temporarily it does some damage.  But in the long haul, over a million or so years, that little plastic six-ring, six-pack thing that you get your cans of soda in, ain't even going to matter.  This planet's had life on it for quite a while, and it always goes away, and something else takes its place.  So I wouldn't worry about it.  James, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, does Earl know that the moon is moving closer to the Earth about an inch every year? 
[02:38:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What now, Earl?  Earl, what do we do to prepare?  Buck Rogers rocket packs on the moon.  That's what we do in 50 years from now.  And we're fired of what they call the retro rockets.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Actually, Long Island was a glacier deposit.  All right.  That's how it was formed.  It was the end of a glacier that came from up north.  It pushed all the way down.  That's where it ended.  And that's where Long Island is, all the garbage.  It was that last piece of poo.  That's it. 
[02:39:00]  Earl, just think.  You know, I was saying millions and millions of years ago, Africa was butted right up against America.  Imagine the boat trip it would have saved if it still would have been like that.  Right?  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I think Earl's right.  He's talking about the San Andreas fault.  Well, we know what he's saying, but he made it sound like it's just going to start drifting away one day.  No, that's going to take, like, millions of years.  Well, that's the point we're making.  I'm sorry. 
[02:39:30]  I put the tail end of the conversation, man.  Earl pretty much made it sound in the back office.  He's trying to correct himself now.  Like, it's going to be like the little volleyball in Castaway just drifting away.  And for a little while, you're going to think, I think I might be able to save this part of the country.  If I jump in now, I think I can pull it back.  All right, Matt, back.  All right, Joe.  What if we just get all the pleasure craft that are out there to push on the beach with their engines full revved, everything from jet skis to big ships, and just push it back into place? 
[02:40:00]  Earl, comment.  Erica, what's up?  It's to you, Earl.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, you're bringing up a tragic childhood memory of mine.  Yeah?  Yeah, I remember my best friend used to live next door to me, but then Europe floated away.  Europe floated away.  Bye, guys.  That happened?  That's terrible.  You're carrying on a nice conversation with some English chap, and all of a sudden, there's thousands of miles of ocean in between you.  What happened? 
[02:40:30]  I just saw him yesterday.  And why can't Mexico just float away?  Boy, that sucker's attached, huh?  Yeah, there's some steel workers that did a good job there, huh?  Like America's colon, hanging right off the bottom.  Right.  Little Rio Grande River there, and it doesn't even help.  All the parts you don't want to drift away, drift away, and the ones you want, stay attached.  We need California.  Kind of cool. 
[02:41:00]  But Mexico?  All right.  Well, we should take our first break.  All right.  Here's the breaking news, though.  Seattle, huge earthquake, 7.0.  Breaking news.  Now.  On the old Richter scale-E.  And yeah, that's true.  OPEC has a comment here.  Superman was able to save California, if you remember.  Right.  All he had to do was fly around the Earth real fast in the opposite direction, and time went backwards, and he stopped Lex Luthor's missiles from going into the San Andreas Fault. 
[02:41:30]  See?  So it can be done.  Earl, comment.  Come in.  He's giving you that dirty look.  I love the Earl.  You know that.  Come on.  Hold on.  Uncle Remus is on line, too.  Mr. Remus?  Yes.  Hello there.  Hey.  Hello there, boys.  Listen, I have a hold-out back, and I'm doing some work.  I wanted to know if Earl would like to help me dig to China. 
[02:42:00]  Dig to China?  Dig to China.  Straight through the Earth.  Come out on the other side in Chinatown.  What do you think, Earl?  Earl, get on the mic.  Now, if we dig to China.  If we dig to China, are we going to fall out of the hole?  What will happen?  All right, you pass the midway point through the middle of the Earth.  Now you're digging and climbing.  How is that possible?  Are you really climbing, or are you still digging and you fall out of the hole?  OPEC, I don't think we can answer that.  Earl, comment.  Can we dig all the way through the center of the Earth? 
[02:42:30]  If I can revert to Journey to the Center of the Earth, I believe they went there, and  there were troll people living there.  Well, Anthony, Glenn wants to revert to Bugs Bunny.  Yes, Glenn?  Yeah, when Bugs Bunny got pissed off and he used a hand saw and he sawed Florida off and  it floated away.  Yes, I remember that.  Okay, so there.  Now we've got some evidence that it's possible.  All right, so you just revert to Bugs Bunny and you're good.  Earl, your view.  Yes, yes.  Earl, to you. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  Julio.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I got a question for you.  Yeah.  If California starts drifting away, are the long-distance charges going to be cheaper if  you call Europe?  As they get more expensive for the United States, they will get cheaper, actually for Asia.  For Asia, right.  Right, okay.  That makes sense.  And you've got to know your geography.  Now it makes perfect sense.  You got it.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  Earl? 
[02:43:30]  Earl, to you.  Please, Earl, comment.  Earl?  If you will.  Start buying up that beachfront property.  We have this way about us that makes people just start mumbling to themselves.  I don't get it.  Oh, I don't have the energy to fight anymore.  I'm going to go back and do it.  Call record labels and get a trip I've had. 
[02:44:00]  I thought the guys could give away eventually.  Oh, God.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  How you doing today?  What are you giving away all the good ideas for?  You're going to have all the Cubans want to paddle their whole country this way.  Never mind coming by boat.  You know, now the cat's out of the bed.  Cuba is relatively small compared to a lot of other landmasses, right, Earl?  Now, couldn't they, in fact, just paddle their whole country right over to Florida? 
[02:44:30]  And dock right into Miami.  Since we're all just floating in the ocean.  You know?  You guys are the bad fans.  That would make sense.  One outboard engine.  It might take a while to build up some speed, but once you get a whole country moving, there's no stopping it.  You've got to know that.  Oh, God.  Neil, what's up?  I just want to ask Earl if the moon really is made out of cheese.  Earl, cheese to you.  And can the rocket actually crash into the eye? 
[02:45:00]  Hey, that's a good reference, man.  Interesting.  Very good.  All right.  I'll check back on that.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Earl.  Wow.  Thank you, Earl, for getting on.  Un-effing believable.  Getting our first break together today.  Fantastic.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  2-1-3-2-7-0-2-7-1.  2-1-3-4-4-4-3.  2-1-3-5-7-0-2-7-1-0-2-7-0-2-7.  It's very rare.  3-1-1-2-7-1-1-2-7-0-2-4-7. </pre>
