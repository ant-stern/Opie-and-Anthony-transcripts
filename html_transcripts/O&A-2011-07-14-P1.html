<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment dominated by Patrice's contentious and often offensive commentary on his experiences with Chinese people, focusing on perceived cultural differences in service, tipping, and social interactions.  He shared numerous anecdotes, many laced with racist stereotypes, about Chinese restaurants and individuals he'd encountered.  The hosts and callers engaged in a similar vein, with several Asian callers offering counterpoints to Patrice’s generalizations.  The discussion briefly touched upon a Seth Meyers' ESPY Awards hosting gig before returning to the racially charged commentary.  This portion of the show was heavily laden with vulgar language and offensive jokes.

The show then abruptly shifted to a far more serious tone, focusing on the brutal murder of a nine-year-old boy in New York City.  The hosts and caller, Cousin Dave, expressed their outrage and anger at the crime, using highly offensive language and discussing the crime's details as reported in the New York Post. The conversation revolved around the death penalty, the justice system, and the hosts' and Cousin Dave's anxieties as parents, sharing anecdotes about encountering “creepy” individuals near playgrounds.  They also discussed the perceived reactions of the Hasidic community to the murder.

Following this heavy segment, the show transitioned back to lighter fare, revisiting Seth Meyers’ ESPY Awards performance and mentioning studio guest Matt Kemp, a Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder.  The discussion then shifted to a detailed, humorous planning session for a large KFC feast for the show's staff,  involving a joking lottery system for assigning food items, specifically mentioning staff member Mars receiving only dark meat. This was followed by a discussion of New York City restaurants, focusing on various cuisines and a comparison of pizzerias, Ruby Rosa and John's.  A lengthy debate over the merits of various bands, including Guns N' Roses, Queen’sryche, Faith No More, and Alice in Chains, ensued.  A Fox News correspondent who previously rejected a date with one of the hosts was briefly mentioned.  Joe DeRosa joined the show as a studio guest towards the end of this segment. A video of a physical altercation at a pool was also shown and discussed.  The segment concluded with a commercial for a humorous instructional video on self-oral sex.

The next segment heavily featured music discussions, with the hosts passionately debating various artists and albums, including Meatloaf, Queen, Guns N' Roses, Van Halen (and a lengthy discussion about Sammy Hagar's tenure), and Extreme.  Their preferences in Snapple flavors were inexplicably linked to their musical opinions.  A significant portion involved watching and discussing the cult classic film "Heavy Metal Parking Lot," touching briefly on Rob Halford's coming out.  The discussion included 80s cars and Long Island slang. Joe DeRosa, already in the studio, performed an a capella version of "Easy" by the Commodores, intended as karaoke. The hosts then discussed Dave Grohl ejecting a concertgoer, leading to stories about other musicians doing the same.  The sales figures of Slim Whitman’s albums were compared to those of the Beatles and Elvis.  The movie "The Change-Up" and its perceived avoidance of certain plot points due to Hollywood morality were also discussed.  The segment ended with a running gag where the hosts tricked Joe DeRosa into thinking the show was off the air.  Throughout this segment, the language was highly informal, profane, and included homophobic slurs.

[00:07:30]  the greatest  Asians  they're  so  like  people  I don't  never  have I  met any  other ones  that's  like  they've  been there  a long  time  East  Coast  Asians  like  Chinatown  Asians  just  a whole  other  group  I have  a place  that I  order  sushi  from  I have  it  delivered  Japanese  not as  bad as  Chinese  by the  way  I'm  jumping  in  right  now  I'm  jumping  in  right  now  you have  he has  to  you have 
[00:08:00]  to jump  in  I'm  jumping  in  right  the  fuck  now  still  bad  we  have  to  explore  the  fact  okay  that  look  in  every  group  and this  is  I'm  explaining  it  to  people  out  there  that  wonder  why  white  people  and  black  people  are  the  only  it  seems  that  it's  redundantly  us  talking  about  race  for that  simple  point  is that  we  picked  the  color  that  we  picked  aside  black  and  white  we  don't  get  into  Irish  and  Italian  and  half  Barbados  and  half  Jamaican 
[00:08:30]  it's  black  versus  white  fucking  Chinese  people  every  group  has a  white  person  of that  group  that  they  hate  Puerto  Ricans  are the  white  people  of  Latinos  because  they  don't  have to  swim  here  and  they  treat  them  like  shit  they  treat  every  other  Latino  like  shit  because  they're  illegal  Puerto  Ricans  laugh  at  Arizona  because  they're  not  these  dirty  Mexicans  right  same  thing  as  Japanese  Japanese  are the  white  people  of  fucking  China  of  Asia 
[00:09:00]  and  they  act  a little  sushi  restaurants  they have  a little  bit more  personnel  when you  go to  sushi  restaurants  and you  having  trouble  those  people  are  Chinese  but  that's  what  I'm  talking  about  this  place  does  both  Chinese  and  Japanese  and  I  think  they  have  like  a  Japanese  sushi  guy  that  makes  the  sushi  but  everyone  in  charge  is  Chinese  so  when I  order  first  of all  I  get  stressed  out  to the  point  of  like  I'm  sweating 
[00:09:30]  when I  have to  call  the  ordering  because  I  know  no  matter  how  many  fucking  times  I  give  them  my  goddamn  address  they  cannot  get  that  address  right  on  the  phone  I'll  be  like  here's  my  address  and  they  give  it  back  to  me  and  it's  a  completely  different  word  than  my  street  completely  different  word  and  you  try to  get  the  order  right  with  them  and  it's  on  their  menu  they  wrote  the  fucking  thing  and  they're  frustrated  because  they  can't  understand  you  in this 
[00:10:00]  great world  where we  speak  this  language  exactly  I'm  doing  what  I'm  supposed  to  be  doing  and  now  I've  been  I've  been  like  for  years  you  use  the  same  place  because  you  just  get  used  to  it  and  everything  and  I  always  ask  for  extra  soy  sauce  and  they  bring  me  I got  like  stacks  of  sushi  and  I  got  two  thimbles  two  thimbles  of  fucking  soy  sauce  am  I  supposed  to  dip  all  these  California  rolls  in  this

[00:31:00]  sorry  for  your  mother  that's  for  mom  I  feel  sorry  for  your  mother  what  you say  motherfucker  what  motherfucker  but go ahead  dude  I'm sorry  I'm gonna come  down there  no but I mean  it's not right  white people come in  there and treat us  like crap  and you love it  you love it  I see how white  people treat you  and you fucking  love to get treated  like shit  by white people  we love the money  I'm married to a  white woman now  but listen  we love the money  we love the money  that we get from you  and we treat you  like crap too 
[00:31:30]  because  the way you guys  look at us  sometimes  is like  well this  this fucking guy  who came over here  and is just running  this restaurant  can I  can I  can I tell you  what black people  do with Asians  we come in  and we're super  we super  we want  we want you  to be nice  to us  so bad  you treat us  like  shit  we go into  your bulletproof  Chinese restaurants  and  and you treat us 
[00:32:00]  like garbage  and we  are above you  in the oppression  game  you don't  treat us  bad  we treat  you bad  like  meaning  meaning  this  don't treat  us like  white people  treat us  nigga  we're in  this together  it's like  I come in  your restaurant  you're in  a black  community  restaurant  treating  me  like  shit  black people  love  Chinese food  and we  love the  bad  Chinese food  white people  going to  it's like  I want  no MSG  I want  the specific  thing  steamed 
[00:32:30]  broccoli  brown rice  black people  go give us  the horse shit  that you  was going  to throw  away  and we  going to  eat it  come on  man  and again  you married  a white  woman  you didn't  even marry  your rigid  corny ass  women  you didn't  I bet your  parents didn't  like that  right  no they  loved it  why  ask them  why did  your parents  like that  they don't  know  so  oh you  kept it  from them  well no  they're  kind of  not in  the country 
[00:33:00]  anymore  oh boy  oh no  a whole story  second Asian  is American  though  why were you  saying the  parents don't  mind  because they  love white  people  it's an  upgrade  if an Asian  marries a  white person  an Asian  woman marries  a white  guy  it's a  fucking  tremendous  upgrade  in other  cultures  that's not  the case  they love  white guys  but let an  Asian girl  bring a  white guy  home  alright Mark  thank you 
[00:33:30]  I gotta give  some other  people a  chance  here  I appreciate  you  defending  your culture  there  let's go  to Justin  in Ohio  Justin  hey what's up  boys  hey man  hey  okay so  I'm  Filipino  American  and  I just  started  listening  to this  show  I've been  in the  dentist  so I  I'm just  catching  the tail  end  of the  conversation  and a  lot of  the  generalizations  that you  guys have  made  about  Asians  are fairly  accurate  I must  say  and  I don't  know  I  okay 
[00:34:00]  but  you know  you're  still on  I lost  you get  an MSG  headache  in the  middle  of your  phone call  basically  but the  small  penis  thing  I'll  admit it  I'm  not  you know  packing  really  anything  big  but  I  will  tell  you  can I  say  one  thing  about  the  small  penis  thing  it  doesn't  matter  I'm  not  packing  major  board  like  that  I'm 
[00:34:30]  saying  as  far  as  the  misery  of  the  women  is  that  they  they're  so  committed  to  their  own  people  but  they  won't  explore  something  else  that  maybe  a  bigger  dick  will  make  them  happier  but  they're  so  fucking  loyal  to  their  fucking  bullshit  that  they  won't  fuck  with  a  nigga  fuck  with  a  big  dick  Puerto  Rican  that's  what  I'm  saying  I  don't  know  if  you've  ever  been  to  Ohio  buddy  but  there  are  so  many  Asian  women  that 
[00:35:00]  are  with  black  dudes  here  yeah  but  that's  magical  niggas  like  you gotta  have  genie  pants  silver  shoes  and  half  afro  and  half  fucking  dreadlocks  you can't  be a  normal  nigga  you have  to be  fucking  you have  to be  a  fucking  what's  his name  Maxwell  or what's  the other  guy  fucking  Lenny Kravitz  to get a  Chinese  bitch  nigga  you can't  be a  regular  nigga  and get  a  Chinese  bitch  they ain't  having  it  man  they ain't  having  it  he's  a big 
[00:35:30]  fat  bastard  telling  you  I  take  pride  in  learning  a  little  bit  about  it  because  it's  interesting  shit  I  give  money  to  Asian  people  have  great  service  they do  not  bullshit  man  my  dry  cleaning  as much  as I  would  want  to  find  I  used  to  go to  a  Russian  lady  for  my  dry  cleaning  she  was  a  wonderful  talking  woman  but I  would  have  fucking  jelly  stains  on  my  pants  and I  don't  eat  jelly  this  Asian 
[00:36:00]  guy  the  service  is  phenomenal  but he  just  won't  be nice  to me  he  just  won't  be  nice  there's  an  Asian  buffet  that I  frequent  close to  where I  live  and there's  this  fucking  asshole  manager  no matter  how nice  you are  towards  him  you know  just talk  to him  friendly  and say  hello  and how  are you  doing  he's  a big  fucking  cocksucker  here's  your food  no thank  you  or anything  you gotta  deal with  the fucking  public  you gotta  have a  personality 
[00:36:30]  you gotta  show  something  shocking  right  right on  man  all right  Justin  thank you  all right  Bobby in  New York  Bobby  hey  I have  actually two  examples  one I have a  friend living in  Hong Kong  and he  just came home  for a couple  weeks and  he says you  don't understand  what it's like  to be spit on  and I thought  like they were  spitting on him  because he was  American  no no they  just spit  as a part of  their culture  and indoors  it doesn't matter  if they're  clearing their throat  they're spitting out  just like if  they won't  hold the door  open for you 
[00:37:00]  because it's  it's a waste  it's considered  a waste of time  what's the waste  of time  holding a door  like there's no  politeness  because you  I'm gonna try  that one out  I wonder if that's  real  and then if you  get yelled at  you go  I'm not wasting  my time  exactly  that's where  it goes  wow  I could relate  to it  where I worked  in a Chinese  restaurant for  about four years  delivering  now I was  considered a peasant  because I was  delivery guy  but from the  area I'm from  a good area  and you made  a lot of good  money delivering  the food  but once they  realize like  the size of your 
[00:37:30]  house or what  you drive  they treat you  like you're  you're just  you know  you're one of  them now  because you  have enough  money  because in  their country  it's if you  you have all  the money  or no money  and you're  treated like  a peasant  well look at  you trying to  talk low  and I'm at  work and I  don't want to  be too loud  and another  thing is they  don't understand  any type of  humor like  sarcasm  I don't think  they do either  it doesn't  relate  yeah yeah  it doesn't  translate  sarcasm  only thing  that's funny  to them  is 
[00:38:00]  fucking  a girl  with fucking  a blurred  out pussy  with a rat  crawling in  her asshole  let me  I saw a  fucking  Chinese thing  where they  had a  bitch's head  sticking out  of the floor  and gave her  a fucking  meatloaf hat  and let  and let  heal a  monster  Komodo  dragons  run around  to eat  the meatloaf  hat  and they  think that's  hilarious  that's one of  those game  shows right  they think  it's hilarious  they don't  care if 
[00:38:30]  people are  just about  being killed  that's what  they find  funny though  like they  let people  run on  icebergs  and let  them fall  off and  smash their  face into  one when  they're  trying to  jump  and we  step  on that  what do  they call  that show  on ABC  the great  buns  I watched  Ninja Warrior  and the  other thing  they do  the great  buns  I watch  but after  a while  you go  this is the  meatloaf hat  oh man  look at this  it's a pork  chop  it's a big  fucking  gila monster

[00:39:30]  Kobe  beef  fucking  strapped  to the  top  and  they're  all  laughing  the  thing's  freaking  out  now  how old  are the  girls  they look  like  fucking  well they

[00:48:30]  because if it's a  it's a marketing ploy  like they want him to  look good in the  movie yeah but they  got old clips of him  when he was like  literally uh an  embryo fucking  playing a guitar and  showing skills got  that from my  brother's doing that  he was never justin  bieber he didn't have  the look yeah when  joe was a kid he was  a pretty cute little  did he have the nice  emo hair though he did  have some crazy  fucking yeah where's joe's  fucking turn i don't know  i apologize he never got  it yeah yeah but this

[00:53:00]  ago uh-huh yeah that guy not this  crazy anthony that guy does this  bother you at all oh yeah because as  a parent it's fucking brutal yeah  this one you know that i we knew this  the first thing in the morning  yesterday oh yeah i didn't tell uh i  didn't tell my wife i was like i i did  no good could come out of telling my  wife about this fucking story yeah she  finally found out on her own and it  was and she fucking broke down and  cried no that's every parent's  fucking nightmare that what happened  to the and and the people oh god now  you got me going the people that 
[00:53:30]  don't believe in the death penalty  should shut the fuck up yeah why why  should we save this guy's life yeah if  this guy guess what i don't want your  answer because i'm not gonna listen  you know what it costs who gives a  fuck how much it costs yeah why should  this fucking animal this monster walk  the planet yeah why you know there  isn't you it's not a thing of  punishment you do this or that not  kill him i i hope the boys you know 
[00:54:00]  tuned him up on the way to the  station house because but then again  you're not even allowed to do that  anymore there used to be a little  justice that was paid to these  animals apparently suffolk county still  likes to throw the fists around a  little bit really that's kind of nice  yeah when they busted that guy that  all right right right the pharmacy  pharmacy pharmacy oh boy i i heard uh i  heard some inside information on that  yeah um from a couple of guys and uh if  you looked at his face that was an mp5 
[00:54:30]  right the butt of it right into his eye  they just cracked him in the face wow with  that uh with the uh uh the butt of a  small um like submachine gun yeah yeah it  right across you if you look at a  picture of the guy that was arrested for  the the shooting there and you mean lee  harvey oswald yeah lee pretty much lee  he looks like lee harvey oswald they  cracked him right across the eye and the 
[00:55:00]  head and the bridge of the nose with uh  the uh shoulder oh you could see the  imprint basically yeah wow yeah i think he  should i think he should die i think the  monster in brooklyn should die yeah i i'm  so bad i think pretty much if you kill  someone on purpose you should die simple  as that oh that's crazy i'm sorry but  that's how i feel but guess what when  when this monster thing uh develops and  they go to trial and all that they're  not gonna seek the death penalty some  asshole will step forward go oh this  isn't a death penalty case no no really a 
[00:55:30]  nine-year-old that's lost yeah you bring  him to your house and you chop him up  chop him up put him in a suitcase throw  him in a dumpster but it's like that's  not a death penalty case really and i and  i already know this they haven't said  shit but watch watch how this plays out  oh this isn't a death penalty case and  even if uh uh we luck out and it's a  death penalty case we'll never do  anything about it guaranteed had the  death penalty in new york for many many  years and we haven't fucking done  anything with it so once you just get  rid of it i love the big bruiser with 
[00:56:00]  the mets jersey now back to the pharmacy  guy yeah the pharmacy guy that's all  over the place took him took him out of  the vehicle and put him in you know he  got a few shots in yeah oh yeah this guy  got a few fucking fists into his face oh  yeah uh but this yeah this story and it's  horrible the new york post got a picture  of the surveillance camera just looking at  the little kid walking down the street yeah  he's like any kid with a little backpack  kid lost he's uh and i think he was on the  phone with his mom or something and uh and 
[00:56:30]  she was trying to explain to him where  to go he was like he was about seven  blocks away from uh his mom yeah and  this creepy guy and this creepy guy that  everyone knew was a fucking creep that  hung out in playgrounds and i just said  the other day like roland yeah exactly i  said the other day that it's illegal to  hang out in uh new york city playgrounds if  you're alone yeah so maybe he was on the  outskirts of the playground and then they  basically said this guy couldn't believe  his luck he's a creep and a nine-year-old  is lost and and right in front of him yep 
[00:57:00]  so then he drives into his parents house  where he's living in the attic and i  think somewhere in that 48 hour period i  think it was about 48 hours he fucking  he smothers the kid and then chops him  up and puts him in his freezer yeah put  like his feet in the freezer and then  fucking disgusting and a suitcase and  then he wheeled it to a dumpster it's a  really really and this guy deserves to  take one more breath why why it's deeply 
[00:57:30]  uh troubling and and one of the uh one of  the papers basically said uh monsters are  real yeah that's a real live monster that  was the first line of the article monsters  are real that's a real live monster looks  like ron valeri you notice that does he oh  god oh wow so a little too inside yeah  but yeah look at the guy that basically  discovered me and aunt uh who uh i don't  know where he is he might be at our old  station still in boston he does look this  guy looks just like him fucking ghoul kind 
[00:58:00]  of creepy right that's a guy that should  just be uh fucking bludgeoned what do the  hasidics think of that shit they uh they  had a big uh turnout for up for him well  thousands yeah because the kids already  buried yeah yeah they they whoa they're  lickety split those jews like to get that  funeral stuff but do hasidics believe in the  death penalty and eye for an eye shit and i i  don't know they tear this guy apart like a  like a like ants tearing apart a dead  cricket i don't i don't know if it was  that tone it was more about the kid and and 
[00:58:30]  you know his father said you know you just  thanks god he had him as long as he did so  they're very you know kind of forgiving like  in that way but uh you know behind the scenes  they gotta be thinking hmm get that hasidic  mafia out there you think they got one  they probably do right everyone does every  group's got their little mafia i would hope  so yeah yeah that's just a horror i don't  know what else to say about it and someone's  saying that uh having a child made me human i  would i swear to god think the exact same 
[00:59:00]  way if i didn't have a no no even i'm it's  like hope you said even me being the creep  that i am i i can't even joke about that i  mean there's no there's no joke there no  there's just a horrible fucking there's  some story there's some things i mean very  few in our world that are untouchable you  know what i mean yeah yeah we have a lot  of black comedy in this show but this one  is just so damn depressing yeah give it a  week you think nah have fun with that 
[00:59:30]  there's no way i'll be an observer i'll  watch no this is that's just terrible  and what do you do man i mean you know  there's creeps in your neighborhood i said  it to a mom the other day i i have to now  hang out with moms when i'm in these uh yeah  in these playgrounds all the men are still  working yeah an hour yeah that's what it is  and they look at me like what the fuck do  you do that you're hanging out at a  playground at 12 noon ghoul yeah and uh 
[01:00:00]  what and i think a lot of parents could  relate to this when you become a father in  my case or a parent let's say you know who  the creeps are you see creeps i think when  you become a parent like they give you a  special vision all of a sudden because i've  walked the streets of new york they live you  could just see them i've walked my  neighborhood a million times not thinking  twice about anybody or anything i see the  same people over and over again and and  thought nothing of it just walked by him  now that i walk with my kid it's like i  have this new vision and i could point him 
[01:00:30]  out that's a wonderful child you have  that he's gorgeous regis is a creep i  could tell he's in your neighborhood i  should i should go around with the nypd i'll  i'll pick out all the problems that's the  guy right there easily that's the guy  easily and i think parents uh know exactly  what i'm talking about all of a sudden you  look at people differently and you just  know you're like a pervert esp yes you  don't know to the extent you're not sure  if they would ever act on it but you know 
[01:01:00]  who the creepy fucking uh mostly guys are  the goals what do they do like walk  around the parks and and stuff no not the  parks they're not allowed in but like  like uh central park or something it's the  look uh it's the look or looks they give  my kid really oh yeah and you can tell the  difference where like someone go oh that's  a you know a cute kid or whatever and then  you see the look and maybe a little too  long uh and you can almost see into their  soul like fuck maybe that's evil and it's 
[01:01:30]  not just like oh there's a cute kid uh you  know i'll just be like wow that's a cute  kid yeah i get that that's fine i understand  that but but you see something else yesterday  i was in the park or evil yesterday i was in  the park and my kid wandered over to some  some like sorry mars some hispanic that had  like uh like uh sorry that wow sorry that  you're hispanic sorry for the story i'm  about to say and he had a mountain dew or 
[01:02:00]  something my kid was grabbing for that and  the guy's like no no you don't want that you  know because soda's not not the best thing  well he probably had rum in it but then all  sudden he's you know those people oh maybe  that's what it was something like that and  then you know he's he's admiring my my  kid and then i i was this close to punch  him in the face and then all of a sudden  he's like oh you got nice nike shorts and  then went down and grabbed them a little  bit what that's it that like i'm like  who the fuck you would do that and then  i'm in my mind i'm like do i fucking 
[01:02:30]  react you know what i mean it was just  enough he didn't they were they were  hanging shorts so he didn't actually  officially touch my kid kid yeah but  also he had like his two fingers on the  shorts like like hey shorts or something  i'm like fucking high alert man i'm like am  i gonna fucking knock this guy out that's  so fucked up and then i was then i just  kind of got out of the situation  immediately and this is what the fuck  and you know what it could have been  completely innocent to be fair it could  have been and we have we have uh found 
[01:03:00]  out they do touch their own family yeah  mars uh mars mars and light on that and  it's been backed up by many other  hispanics on the phone and here live in  the studio oh my god killing him is too  easy give him hard labor without parole  cousin dave stop we've talked about this  before cousin dave hey guys hi buddy  thanks that is too good for this guy you  got to give him a life of hard labor  without any chance of parole let him like  cool and let him cut weeds in alabama 
[01:03:30]  something doesn't matter you know like i  said that just becomes part of your life  you look at that and say wow that would  be horrible but one when you're in  something and actually there and doing  it it's not as bad as people think it is  because it's just now your life yeah  you're in the fresh air in alabama  cutting weeds looking at nature a little  bit not doing as much work as you're  supposed to do the boss is an asshole  maybe this guy you know it's the same 
[01:04:00]  shit maybe if you could put him on the  ground a hundred feet and he has to  just pound rocks all day yeah in a cave  and get fucked in the ass like every  night this guy needs to suffer killing  him because no no just eliminate him  from suicide fuck his suffering fuck is  this he he needs to be eliminated from  from the planet just just gone it's not  even about like suffering because then  we'd say all that bullshit with you know 
[01:04:30]  they ought to torture a man drawn and  quartered uh uh cut off his dick with a  fucking dull knife like all that shit that  everybody says what should happen and  you know what all good suggestions yeah  but it ain't gonna happen well we know  none of that shit will ever happen we  do sort of have this death penalty thing  you know most states don't use it  anymore just kill him and no 20 years  of fucking appeals oh my god because  that gets people in a mindset where they  accept the fact that they're going to  be put to death they actually are they  have so many years to contemplate it and 
[01:05:00]  think it that it doesn't bother them as  much as it would if next Tuesday you  went you know what you're getting killed  and how and how this plays out the cops  were on to him uh because there's  surveillance everywhere you can't walk  around with you know having your picture  taken yep and the kid ended up in front  of a dental office and this guy was paying  his dental bill yeah and he waited seven  fucking minutes the kid did outside while  he went inside to pay his bill and then  grabbed the kid nicely at first I guess and 
[01:05:30]  brought him to his attic apartment at his  parents house so the police were on his  trail obviously and uh they show up and  uh his door was slightly ajar they called  his name they went in this is serial  killer fucking shit and uh the cops or the  detectives go to this guy uh you know  why we're here where's the boy and then  he points to the fucking kitchen just like  in a movie so the the detectives go into  the kitchen and and the handle on the on the 
[01:06:00]  on the uh refrigerator was all bloodstained oh  shit and what they found was like bloody  knives and then in the freezer was the  kids feet in ziploc bags so my question is I  would never be able to be a cop or a  detective oh I know I would have taken the  guy out right and I know a lot of guys  like yeah I I would have to just take him  out he lunged for my weapon yeah hopefully  hopefully my partner would back me up I 
[01:06:30]  would have to take him out yeah I read  that it it's chilling yeah it's fucking  chilling you know it's him at that point  of course no like well he ought to go to  trial because we're not sure of it of  course just take care of it right there  could you and I'm not questioning uh the  detectives and their jobs or the police I I  understand I do understand you know yeah  but I don't know how you you don't yeah  because I put myself in that position I  would I would lose my mind well they 
[01:07:00]  probably do but they go and he points to  the kitchen that's right out of a fucking  movie isn't it know why we're here wow  where's the boy and they're hoping for  the best like maybe he's tied up in a  closet or something he just points to the  kitchen hey oh wow that's creepy he  doesn't give you that that's horror movie  shit it is right so judge op dread they're  calling you yeah what are you gonna I 
[01:07:30]  mean dude I hate there are people like  this out there I fucking hate it you're  a disease I'm the cure cobra cobretti  more people like him so this guy will live  large and in jail for the rest of his  life large and in charge well they'll  get his he'll be in charge they'll get  his TV programs do you think so yes  anyway oh we were talking about the  ESPYs last night Seth Meyers oh right  so you uh I didn't see this like you 
[01:08:00]  did yeah this is a first for me here's  uh Seth Meyers killing it at the ESPYs  there was more big big basketball news  this year Shaquille O'Neal announced his  retirement from basketball only three  years after his feet retired  it's just he's so big it took three years  for his feet to send the message to his  brain Shaq retired after he couldn't  recover from a calf injury man if only 
[01:08:30]  there were a magical rapping genie who  could somehow grant him one more wish  that's funny Yao Ming announced that he's  retiring from basketball or that he's  retiling his bathroom it's really hard  to say  all right that's very good  we can't know we can only guess we can't  know we could all why all right whatever  you think the Asian groups go after him  for that uh no because you can't understand 
[01:09:00]  the word he said yeah uh opie new york courts  overturned the death penalty in 2004  unconstitutional laval case is that true  what i thought we still had it 2004 when  pataki was uh was out nah we still have the  death penalty don't we we just haven't used  it really i'm not sure you know i because they  never used it when we had it so we would  have known if they overthrew the death  penalty in new york wouldn't we yeah anyone 
[01:09:30]  else can help us out with that  oh uh seth byers continues with this  ditty and in other news uh other nba news  kim kardashian is getting married to new  jersey net chris humphries asked why she  picked a new jersey net kim said that she  was tired of dating pro athletes  wow you don't have to no nets are here  we haven't had a net here for 15 years  jason kidd was the last net here he moved 
[01:10:00]  on a long time ago too wow that's a good  one huh he's he's killing he sure is i  wish i would have watched it oh it was a  lot of fun to watch it sounds like it was a  lot of fun by the way i should point out  the proceeds from tonight's uh show go to a  very worthy charity the los angeles dodgers  of america  dodger outfielder matt kemp is here tonight 
[01:10:30]  yeah  frank mccord told matt kemp have fun tonight  and then added if they have any ketchup  packets grab as many as you can  because we have run out of ketchup  dodger stadium no longer has ketchup  the dodgers are so broke when players  steal bases frank mccord asks that they  please return them  the dodgers are so broke their third base  coach is just a mirror reflecting the 
[01:11:00]  image of their first base coach  that's funny  some good lines that's funny  some good lines uh one more from seth  myers at the espies last night talking about football a lot of football news  yeah the ucon huskies won the nca title with a 53 41 victory over butler let's give it up for ucon  but it wasn't all good news in college basketball byu forward brandon davis was kicked off the basketball team after he admitted to violating the school's honor code by having premarital sex with his girlfriend 
[01:11:30]  luckily his girlfriend goes to arizona state so she actually got course credit  it's been reported that the nfl lockout may be ending next week and i think we can all agree that's great news yeah  ray lewis warned that if there is no season the crime rate would go up though he didn't say specifically what he had in mind 
[01:12:00]  it would be an incredible shame to lose the nfl football season after the amazing year we just had michael vick  returned to a starting row and had a starting role and had a truly amazing season for the philadelphia eagles in fact  he even received several mvp votes mostly from cats  play matthews laughing on the inside 
[01:12:30]  but the biggest story in football is the green bay packers  beating the steelers 31-25 in the super bowl  the green bay packers became the first team since 1962 to go an entire season  without trailing more than seven points proving once and for all  that not every statistic is interesting  and finally give it up for aaron rogers  aaron rogers who won the super bowl and finally got out of the shadow of brit farve 
[01:13:00]  which we learned thanks to cell phone technology is not as big a shadow as we originally thought  a little dick joke there you go the espies uh and norton was covering the espies for leno right  oh that's what he was doing uh should be on tonight i would imagine  and uh yeah so check out leno and and see how uh norton did with the espies 
[01:13:30]  interviewing all these clowns you gotta you gotta know a lot about like sports to do that  to do what to host that i think nah don't you think like no he's got writers yeah i would love  to know how many of those jokes were his but in order to to deliver it with confidence the  confidence was a little yeah there was confidence there yeah i thought it was pretty confident  there his delivery was a little weird i think it was i'm not saying i think that's his delivery  though okay i'm not saying it was a bad delivery it was just a little but let's say you get to host 
[01:14:00]  like an award show or something on a subject that you have no fucking clue right right the fucking  tonys or something it's a it's like they could write shit for you and you could read it but unless  you really know what's going on you're just like what is that fun like if you don't even know it's  funny i don't know if you can convey it yeah to the the people i don't know but that was basic sports  knowledge right there yeah yeah his jokes were based on basic sports knowledge yeah it was kind 
[01:14:30]  of the headline shit yeah i guess i don't know i hear what you're saying yeah because i i i'm not  like a sports guy where i know players names statistics things like that and there are some  people that just know everything yeah but if you got if you got writers and you were hosting the sbs  and and oh when well i think next year is all righty and uh and then you practice me on it  practice your jokes a little bit maybe do a little googling to go oh i see i think i think you could 
[01:15:00]  certainly yeah yes oh wait i'd have to do some work and research and stuff a little bit just a little  bit but they pay you well uh let me say hi to craig in oregon for some reason yeah go ahead craig  yeah buddy i just want to say i gotta agree with john brachano i got four kids but my youngest is  five-year-old girl and we just went camping and you know we've been down at the beach and so she had  you know a little towel over her bathing suit and everything else we went in the store and this one  guy like looks down and like you can just fucking tell he reaches down and says i'm like don't i break 
[01:15:30]  his fucking fingers i mean they're just you just know after a while they just fucking stare too long  they get like this little fucking twinkle in their eye that makes you just want to fucking punch  yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna front and i'm not playing the tough guy role i will punch a  father i i just know it already i i come home from punching somebody yeah because like first of all  i was telling travis we went for uh coffee this morning he's got a two-year-old anybody look at 
[01:16:00]  travis in a sexual way because he uh he does look uh very twinkish babyish i was telling travis i hope  the kid thing isn't too much we'll move on but basically i learned very recently that kids  are passive aggressive assholes every single one of them really my son not yet but i would assume he  has to be two but he's too young to be passive aggressive i think he got to be around i think  it starts around two i'll do more research oh those terrible twos they're passive aggressive 
[01:16:30]  assholes we're we're at a playground and there's these sprinklers that the little kids play play uh  in and i mean the the water shoots up maybe six feet so little kids can you know you know get wet  and play in the water a little bit right right this fucking asshole and this is why i'm gonna punch  your father because you can't punch the kid right this fucking asshole steps on the sprinkler no big  deal kids having fun right but then realizes if he moves his foot just enough he can spray my kid in 
[01:17:00]  the face like and listen oh my god listen i i understand you know i i can't protect my kid  from everything and a little water in the face is not gonna do him any harm all right so so yes i get  that part of it but knowing that kid did it on fucking purpose yeah fucking moved his foot just  enough to you know spray my kid in the face and my kid's like what the fuck and then runs away  like a passive aggressive fucking cunt and then i look no no in my neighborhood the high fives the 
[01:17:30]  black fucking nanny oh really it's all black nannies that i'm hanging out with but i look  immediately for the father because i'm like i'm gonna fucking punch the father i know it's gonna  happen like i didn't teach him this shit he figured it out oh my god and then the other day uh my kid  is playing in a puddle because now the water like you know piles up in a puddle and he's got a little  pail in front of him right yeah i'm embarrassed that i'm about to say this i i i thought i would 
[01:18:00]  not bring this one to the show oh fuck oh boy so this kid now this kid's about four or five  fucking runs from the other side of the sprinklers and kicks the pail that's six inches in front of  my son's face my son's only 14 months old yeah yeah kicks the pail like he's kicking a fucking  football the water and the dirty water everything goes flying in my kid's face the pail hits my kid  i jumped up and i went right after the kid i go and i swear this is an exact quote i go i don't 
[01:18:30]  give a fuck how small you are i will beat the shit out of you holy shit i can't believe i'm saying  this on the radio to a little kid i can't believe i'm saying this on the radio but i did say that  i was enraged because i mean if if the kid missed the pail he was kicking my my son you know hard  right in the fucking face yeah and that's when a black nanny jumps up and i'm like am i now going  to be in a fight what am you doing am i going to be in a fight with the nanny and then uh the nanny 
[01:19:00]  grabs the kid and gives him a time out on the bench i'm like oh oh fuck all right okay let's see what  these nannies are because now i'm wondering that it's a big burly father just heard that i said that  to his son and now there's going to be a problem right and then the nannies apologizing left and right  because it was it was pretty ugly yeah to be honest with you it wasn't a little little thing  it was a scene it was a scene in the park and then some of the moms i just met that day they let it  go about 10 minutes but there was the shock of was there a lot of oh yeah yeah one of the moms comes 
[01:19:30]  up to me i don't even know her and she goes i just want to thank you i'm like what huh she goes  that kid's an asshole holy shit i didn't know there was this the whole thing going on that kid's  oh yeah we know that that kid's an asshole he he has taken my kid's toys and and broke them and  and she's giving me all the horror shows i guess this this this kid is a turd in this fucking playground  and then another kid uh another mom is looking and she's nodding like yep she speaks the truth 
[01:20:00]  he's an asshole and instead of being the complete asshole of the playground they're thanking me  for putting this little kid in this place you're the guy this sounds like a rom-com  i think you could i think you could write a rom-com out of this shit  look and i i'm embarrassed that i said that to the kid but it was a situation where she learns early  maybe now if he does it again he's gonna start thinking like 
[01:20:30]  that fucking big crazy guy's gonna yell at me there's been other things that have happened where i  i know it's a complete accident so you just bite your lower lip and go just you know this is shit  that's gonna happen you just gotta understand but this kid knew it was gonna happen oh this was  premeditated yeah yeah full-on kick a little fucker right but then you know then i didn't feel  bad when these two moms uh specifically came up to me like yeah he's a fucking asshole have you had to  uh have you had to trot around with your kid when he's got like a black eye or or a fucking 
[01:21:00]  on his head yeah yeah and you're like the guy like hey look you know how kids are i didn't do  this i knew it you know how kids are yeah i don't know i i said it earlier a couple weeks ago i don't  know how i'm gonna handle this yeah i got problems we all know it and uh every uh i don't know how i  handle this shit you're gonna be that i know i'm gonna get into you're gonna be that little league  dad i that comes running out onto the field oh no yells at the coach for not fucking putting your 
[01:21:30]  kid in oh i don't know uh no i don't think so get him out there you fucking asshole he'll like throw  you out of the game fuck you too i can promise you this i will never hit a kid or kick him or or throw  him or touch him or anything i won't i probably will yell a little bit because that's in my stupid  dna you'll kick dirt on the ump's shoes for calling your kid out but i know i'll probably get in a  fistfight with a dad one day with a man and i'm either gonna do okay or i'm gonna get the shit  beat out of me i know that you know i know that you and i'm not gonna it's gonna happen and i'm not 
[01:22:00]  gonna make believe oh i'm a tough guy and i i won't get the shit kicked out there's a good possibility  i'll end up getting the shit kicked out yeah yeah because of my own stupidity but the kid was an  asshole uh apparently he was and uh that was uh thumbs up or down as a parent mars thumbs way up  thumbs up did i overreact no one says shit like that i'm kind of glad i wasn't gonna bring this  one to the show because i know it sounds horrible no no absolutely right the only thing you did that 
[01:22:30]  i would have done differently right was i would have like secretly told the kid like low whisper  yes yeah too many people heard it oh too many people heard it fucking kick your little ass you  little fucker and i'm shit and i'm sure there was someone in there that didn't approve of it that  did here you're right next time it's gonna be or say things that really scare kids like  i'll kill your mommy and daddy and i'll never see them again like real low and i'll be like  i know you know the internet google casey anthony yeah you little bitch you do anything like that again 
[01:23:00]  you're never seeing mommy and daddy again right i'm sending them to another planet where you will  never see them ever ever because you could lie to kids like that they don't know he's not gonna go  oh you don't have an interstellar traveler you know how i justified it on the way home yeah i i i just  justified it thinking that i just got in a confrontation with an adult midget  it's like yeah the kid knew right hey if he could kick a fucking bucket full of shit like that 
[01:23:30]  he knows a little more than he's letting on and you know what i am not pumping up the story  this kid just full full run right into the fucking bucket and kicked it well the consensus uh asshole  i guess well playground consensus kid's an asshole i guess some kids are just assholes just because  they're kids you know but the best was i want to thank you that kid's an asshole i want to thank you

[01:27:00]  so what do you why patrice isn't here i don't understand this he was here earlier yeah i thought  so the uh see i i i can't relate to that i mean it's entertaining and everything right but i can't  relate to that side of it you know what side like the whole side of having the kid and being there because  i i don't even like they're non-existent to me kids yeah anyone that's under a certain height i 
[01:27:30]  don't even see them it might be better that way think about it i just fucking trod through because  you learn a lot of new shit yeah kids are assholes they're passive aggressive assholes yeah and i would  assume unfortunately my kid's gonna have a little of that in them i don't know hopefully not  yeah i don't know i all i think about like like girlfriends it's the only thing i could  like when when uh yesterday as a matter of fact uh uh my my chick is walking in the city

[01:31:30]  oh god so was that the end of the story yeah yeah just she was like really what else is she and i  was saying i go i go drop the fucking n-bomb next time just do it fuck them you know why because because  if if they're so offended that's the most offensive thing you could say to a black person  and if you couldn't that get her in a situation though well i think what's it gonna do no i'm  just a street i mean you're not gonna say it in a back alley where you're alone right but it's a 
[01:32:00]  street full of people you're crossing 57th by fucking you know 7th avenue or something like that  yeah and it's like yeah there's plenty of people there plenty of other end people too yeah well that's  true but but it's like you know what what are you gonna do you probably laugh what do you mean by  some skinny fucking white chick dropping the n-bomb like that mars what do you mean by n people  n people what's the canadians right canadians i don't care what that means yes what what is the  n people it's a c canadians canadians are called n people n person c people c people what's c people 
[01:32:30]  what are you talking about why why why why am i getting this we speak openly here what are you  talking about when you say n people you know the other guy other than what do you know what he's  talking about and help me please um yes uh he's talking about uh african americans oh my god mars  i am one for this look look here we go i'm right with mars on this because look everybody says 
[01:33:00]  dropping the m-bomb is like is like fucking is crazy you should never use that word and stuff  if somebody does something bad to you or a loved one even verbally whatever and they offend you  why wouldn't you then you why would you use the second best fucking thing you could throw at somebody  because the first one is so bad fuck you i'm going for the a-bomb right there and by a-bomb i mean m-bomb 
[01:33:30]  uh but i'm i'm gonna drop it because that's that will piss that person off and that's my goal  in that situation if somebody pissed me off and they happen to be black why the fuck am i not gonna  do the the one thing that's gonna piss the motherfucking shit off out of him he just pissed  me off to the hilt right to my ultimate piss off level so what i'm supposed to go well i'd like to 
[01:34:00]  piss him off but i'm gonna do the second most pissed off thing to him fuck you dropping it  every day you just described the logic of our show and we've gotten in trouble for doing just  doing just that fuck it basically management's like oh yeah you just went too far too far why  tough shit why if we're gonna fight we're gonna fucking pull out the big guns that's why when people  say i've never used it i've never thought it i don't pull fucking shit if you get cut off  and i mean not cut off and go hey that fucker cut me off where your fucking heart 
[01:34:30]  is in your throat because you thought you were just gonna die as you're driving and you pull up  and you see a african-american gentleman or lady that if you're not saying it that is at least  fucking pumping through your head i with fucking right before it by the way i got a tough question  for you yes sir yes i really do yes sir sean hannity who you like a little more than i do  oh yeah and i do like sean by the way but i think you like him more i like sean yeah he once said on 
[01:35:00]  our show that he has never said the word or thought the word no i'm i'm i cannot i cannot fucking  believe that he he's has to he has to keep a certain decorum with his uh job right he's really  walking i mean he's got people gunning for him all the time right so uh yeah he probably has uh  but i would think that would be a safe thing to admit that we've all thought about that no no it's  not we could sit here on this show thank god and say yes and and speak openly and and and me saying i 
[01:35:30]  absolutely believe but what is it everybody has at least had it go through their head when his answer  wouldn't the better answer be yeah of course i've thought the word i'm only human but i don't think  that's right and i've never said it no not in his line of work wow really that's how fucked  our society is that's that's how fucked it is you can't be not on his part because i guess he's  doing what he has to but it's just dishonesty in general in the media and and and in society can't  be in society but uh yeah hey i'll tell you i think it a lot and i say it occasionally if i want 
[01:36:00]  to fucking if i want to fucking i think it but i don't really lay it in i don't really say it but  there's certain times that you you need to have timing on your side unlike this individual in  this video here oh what is this video does somebody say uh wait mars mars just got some  fucking material for our show finally show prepping holy shit let me sit straight up for this this  gentleman yeah explain this he has a little situation with a few uh brothers a few of the 
[01:36:30]  brothers uh it looks like a public pool uh it's more like a hotel pool or like uh maybe uh one of  those pools you got in your uh apartment complex right ah okay oh wow really and i guess the uh  brothers are a little too loud and the white gentleman decided to voice his opinion uh-huh and  he voiced his opinion very strongly uh-huh and uh i just leave you to and this is it okay let's uh  let's listen to this so wait uh where where is everybody in this who's filming this the brothers

[01:46:00]  mood no one has to work fridays except me and we're the dumbest people in broadcasting yes letterman  doesn't do it you're telling me the red eyes don't do it well they usually don't do it they  usually do it they're just sometimes they don't sometimes yeah sometimes you don't  i mean if we're going to take a day of course we'll take a friday instead of a dumb wednesday  yeah but this place on fridays no one is here yeah they have work in their deals well 
[01:46:30]  this place is a ghost town on fridays except for us yeah but that's what makes it special  i used to be that guy i used to be a lot of guys enough of the special  shit i want my fridays off you know it's that's the thing that sucks about being a comic it's like  the last you know how much i miss working towards happy hour on friday it's like i just  miss it man working yeah because it was really all right i'm almost there yeah almost there it 
[01:47:00]  gave you a goal and it was such a nice like these bars especially manhattan with how  fucking pricey all the bars are it's like you know you see these specials three dollar jamesons  four to six a cocksucker could you move that special to 2 a.m please when i get off for work  nothing worse than the last call for the special but could i have eight please yeah i need eight  piled up in front of me everyone's got a bunch of drinks in front of them do you ever drink through 
[01:47:30]  the special by accident and you go i'll take another one of these bud lights that'll be nine dollars  fuck the fuck just have it yeah he got you at that point yeah yeah i was also a thursday night guy  what's up bud when i was partying the i was a thursday night guy oh i used to have dealt with the  oh yeah and just dealt with the friday thing yeah i would do going off to the happy hour and then  you know get started friday night thursday night i was a thursday night guy for a while it's the it 
[01:48:00]  was the grade when i was in college my major didn't have classes on fridays so for three of the four  years i was at kutztown you could i never had class on friday so thursday was like that was get it  fucking great yeah and then i treated wednesday like thursday sometimes thursdays thursday nights  were better than friday nights because you know you could muddle through friday yeah and it kind  of extend your weekend a little bit right yeah and it's something exciting there's something that's 
[01:48:30]  kind of exciting about going out on a thursday you know you got to work on friday but it's like it's  like that last day of school feeling you're like that's friday yeah it's just about friday  i i was also uh complimenting joe on his breakfast choice because um i've i've sat here for for many  years and in the other studio next to jimmy norton who you know i adore but when he gets that  fucking little that little plastic dish of watery egg whites it's just this nasty egg white thing he 
[01:49:00]  opens it up and it smells like like like a prolapsed asshole yeah it it smells like like  fucking farts it's horrid looks like cancer skin yeah it's all just nasty and wet and shit so joe  cracks open his breakfast there a little plastic thing and there's real eggs in there with the 
[01:49:30]  yolk and everything nice omelet or scrambled whatever that is and then potatoes and some  bacon on there and it just smelled like fucking like that early morning nice house breakfast i  think they invented uh bacon so your breakfast doesn't smell like asshole it's not like yes but  the yolk does something that's what it's all about i agree yolk does something to eggs where when you're  cooking eggs with the yolk in it it doesn't stink up the fucking place it still smells though a little 
[01:50:00]  bit egg whites not as bad as egg whites egg whites are the worst rubbery shit thing i mean that's why  they invented the bacon because you don't come up with this bacon idea they just don't it doesn't make  sense no it's that that would taste good yeah off an animal nobody said let's eat that animal's  asshole wherever the fuck the bacon comes from yes anthony was eating like i don't know what that  he was either but it was like an italian hoagie on a bagel i had a bagel i i every morning pretty 
[01:50:30]  much is like a bagel with just a couple of slices of ham sometimes turkey in there and like one slice  of american cheese and the bagels gotta be fucking toasted bastards don't just heat it up and call it a  toasted bagel a little fucking savage well that's i hope i was telling anthony i joined a gym believe it or  not  sorry and uh and also wait what'd you say i got a personal trainer 
[01:51:00]  that's terrific that's terrific uh-huh and lastly i'm really enjoying working out  how did you see that jerk  no fucking way no fucking way no fucking way no fucking way yeah yeah sure yeah that's that's 
[01:51:30]  no one enjoys working out well that means you're doing something wrong i'm i'm enjoying it right now  because i have that it's i have like that feeling you get when you just quit smoking you're like i'm  gonna do this i'm gunning for this it's gonna be great all right so you're in the gym and you got  a trainer nice i was just saying that why are you eating the bacon well that's what i was saying anthony  and the shitty home fries i'm not eating the home fries but when i went in yesterday he goes would  you eat today i'm it was it was you lie to him no it was early in the day i go i had uh i had bacon 
[01:52:00]  and eggs and toast for breakfast i thought he's gonna reprimand me and he was like no that's good  man he goes eat like that in the morning and then the rest of the day whatever so i was just saying  i think the egg whites thing all that stuff diet soda it's all bullshit it's like i think it's a  myth i don't think what's up what's if you weren't about here it is because because if people are  drinking diet soda and using fake shit in there to try to lose weight and stuff they're the fattest  people it's always the fatties that are drinking the diet soda and eating the fucking 
[01:52:30]  shit that's supposed to keep them skinny well that's because they they uh order the diet soda  after the ridiculous and they eat a fucking it's gonna bounce uh each other out well it's yeah i  mean it's you know we were just saying it's about portion control it's all portion control  and exercise control their portions none none of us people that are like you know that sugar will kill  you man and then they fucking dump a cup of splendor into their something from a laboratory  these health idiots they're like get a skill and and and weigh your chicken cutlet you can tell more 
[01:53:00]  than seven ounces you can fucking tell fucking control that shit but you can tell when you're  eating enough and you've eaten plenty you know when you're sitting there if you're gorging yourself you  go ah yeah that was much too much yeah but but if you're just eating and you're like all right  you know what that's that's plenty as soon as you throw up you know that you had enough to eat  my dad always uh would tell us everything in moderation it's the secret of life everything 
[01:53:30]  in moderation moderation he decided to never eat a salad in moderation  you know what made me hate everything in moderation and then he'd go out for his chicken wings really  can i join you dad because that tastes a lot better than the crap mom is making right now  i i hated hulk hogan ever since that reality show he's just a it's me whatever don't get me started  but anyway yeah he's a douche oh but i saw him once talking to his son this is what put the ice 
[01:54:00]  over the cake and he goes he goes as soon as you get that full feeling brother man that's when you  stop eating man that's enough and then his son ran over somebody or whatever he did and you  know what hulk hogan's wrong the the key actually is what do they say your brain doesn't know your  stomach gets full before your brain knows it so if you want to do this properly you're you're supposed  to stop before you feel full and trust that you are full and then your brain will catch up and say 
[01:54:30]  you're full and ta-da right just no one gets could no one could do that you could see it in your  fucking plate if it's too much food you know yourself yeah but you know too much food is is  one of those i agree with what opi's saying 20 minutes is the interval they say you're supposed  to eat very slowly over the course of 20 minutes and then that's it because that's how long it takes  you to start digesting and your body to go that's enough but too much food that's like what that's like 
[01:55:00]  alcoholics with too much alcohol it's like everybody's got their opinion on what's too much you know what i  mean and you got these people that go oh that's a healthy you're you're a healthy young man you  should eat yeah and then you got these nazis like opi's talking about weigh it you know yeah yeah  way your plate weighs more than four ounces it's too much you know how about this one you know i do uh  salad dressing but i dip my fork in the dressing you fucking dickhead you know whoever does that  you know how delicious salad dressing is oh you're gonna pour that shit all over it like cereal 
[01:55:30]  no no i saved my calories i dip my pork in the dressing  like fucking milk on cereal yes my friend chip one day my friend chip one day was dumping he dumped  so much blue cheese on his salad and i go dude you're really you're really killing the purpose of  the salad and he goes fuck this lettuce it's merely a vehicle to get the blue cheese  to my mouth there's nothing better than blue cheese oh i could eat blue cheese and bacon every 
[01:56:00]  day and i would be happy doing an iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon bits on it jesus how  many calories is that shit it's gotta be throwing his arms up in there oh yeah iraq is going crazy in  there with this food come on come on in he's loving this i i like to see the person uh we're talking  he's loving it if you don't need to be in there come in for a second uh what's your favorite  what's your favorite like just shit bad thing to depression i got the day off i'm depressed i'm

[01:59:30]  do and again i want the gravy and potatoes to be like soup yeah i want i want so much  fucking gravy in that and just shoveling it with and then you take a one of those muffin things and  just scoop the gravy and potatoes onto a muffin and start eating that you mean the biscuits the  biscuits one of those three biscuits muffin things all they need to do is throw some blueberries in  it's a blueberry muffin i swear to you i haven't had kfc in probably 10 years on me if you want 
[02:00:00]  around a kfc let's get this done when are they open well now they're doing the what we're finding  out but now they're doing the uh the broiled chicken i guess the grilled grilled it's not it's  gotta be that fucking original recipe fried motherfucking chicken i will say this  you want to have a for grilled chicken it's the saltiest most delicious shittiest fast food 
[02:00:30]  days of grilled chicken i've ever had it's healthy man it's healthy the sodium content is ridiculous  you go to work the next day your face is twice the size yeah you're all you're drying out on the  inside oh it's fantastic yeah it's uh we could do a taste test today is there a popeye's nearby  oh my god well you go popeye's kfc maybe throw a third in there didn't didn't roland church about  kfc the other day what did he say that it was wonderful no he came in and said uh yeah he said 
[02:01:00]  that like we were supposed to get some or something he said that yeah oh i remember that  get some look but that might be because of the grilled shit you know we're getting fried chicken  today i'm buying for the entire staff oh my outside the staff though tell those guys to go  fuck themselves and no one from management i'm gonna have one leg so mars can't one leg one leg  that's it that's it uh i i i can't i i i fucking what are you a fucking training i've been i've been

[02:02:00]  know the kfc vernacular they got these they got these like donuts they give you yeah it's like a donut  thing but only it doesn't have a hole and it's not sweet the kfc vernacular should we did some  biscuits and should we should we wash it down with some crispy creams too what oh god what the  fuck is going on here look at iraq has got iraq has got the biggest smile i've seen in months 
[02:02:30]  yeah you came in here what if you like the chicken that's good but you really should try  the kfc bowls because it's the boneless chicken mashed potatoes gravy corn and cheese  all together jesus christ when did they invent that i i guess for years five years and you can  eat the whole bowl and everything it's a bowl it's like so the bonus has the skin on it right  the nice crispy skin we all love it it's white meat it looks like they swept the floor and threw  it into a well it doesn't it's not served to you like that somebody you know the cheese melts and they 
[02:03:00]  mix it together and all that but when you get it it looks great and it's delicious it's everything  all at once minus the coleslaw i don't want the cheese now i know kfc's good without the cheese  that's why i always straight from the bowl can you say no cheese um one word parfait  why are you in here iraq you were throwing your arms up you told me oh because you were talking about  the uh he was going crazy for iceberg wedges yeah those iceberg wedges when you told me to come in  yeah no i know but i know we went on to another subject i'm not even trying to beat you  anytime you go to a nice restaurant well i've seen you at steak restaurants we've been at a

[02:11:00]  happened danny and and uh travis and everybody did a great job so i know that chick that she's  singing on tv and i'm like why the fuck is she singing on tv where is she she's a fox news  correspondent that's the one we love chick and she knows how to sing i guess so she's on imus now  and that's what's on right they're doing a battle of the bands on imus well that's pretty cool battle  of bands i asked her out once and she said no are you shitting me no i drank with her one night till  like 4 a.m we've been fucking we have just what's her deal she just was like nah i'm not into it i don't 
[02:11:30]  really date we've been oogling over her oh my god no she just fucking totally turned you down  a lesbo she's a lesbo she's rather les out she totally just turned you down that's what you  gotta tell yourself it's uh or you're a loser she's got some because if she's drinking with  you until four in the morning what's your problem well that's what i said i called her on it i go  you just sat here and drank you know 4 a.m don't act like it's all in my head right now i'll tell  you let me tell you something and i think you can attest to this wow i love those fox people 
[02:12:00]  can fucking drink like no other network i've ever seen animals animals animals complete animals i so  i hit on her the next day i called bobby kill i told him the whole story he goes what's her name  dude and i can't even remember right now but i told him and he looked her up and he goes  i hear him clicking on the internet he just goes okay dude all right first of all this chick's way  fuck it out of your league you you got what you deserve we just took notice of her every once 
[02:12:30]  in a while we'll uh yeah we'll all focus on one of these uh broads she's hot and uh yeah what's her  deal because we've been looking at her i've been on red eye i've been on red eye with her a bunch  she's what's her name first of all we don't even know that it's diane something i can't remember  her last name is it really diane she's very cool actually she's a very cool person like she's a lot  i think so there's some type of a lat latin in her but not much she's she's got she's really 
[02:13:00]  pretty she um she's very nice she's very like girl next story like you know like girl next door  ish okay you know what i mean yeah um that's all i know she's cool she won't date the rosa so i like  her already uh you kick a guy when he's down are we ready to pick to see who gets only sides  the kfc feast we have to first of all troy and mars are not eligible for only sides because  their stipulations for instance troy is not allowed to have sides anyway so he's not in the well how 
[02:13:30]  about hmm let me think no no no we can't do that because then that would be two heads i was going  to say some way where they can well i would get nothing i would i would i would i would allow troy to  be in on this contest yeah yeah and what about mars because mars has been required to have one order  of green beans well you have to have green beans no matter what so then he can't be in the  well sides only okay all right so mars is in two yeah that's fine um and danny are you going to eat  chicken i have some chicken okay treat yourself treat yourself opie if you pull the if you pull the just 
[02:14:00]  sides it's going to be such a the most classic thing ever after it was told his whole idea because  we've talked it up and it's like you remember you can almost smell and taste it right now  and to draw a just size is going to be a horrible horrible thing this is but i think fun it would  be funnier if e-rock or ksc roulette who really enjoy you know their food yeah if they pick the 
[02:14:30]  size that would be the funniest thing wait roland and e-rock enjoy food wait what are you talking about  really roland is roland is a rain man when it comes to food i'll go because we hang out a lot  because we live very close to each other and i'm you know i'm bored i'll call up rome we'll walk the  neighborhood and i'll just mention a food type and he'll tell you the restaurant to go to in new york  city he's like you want to try it it's unbelievable you go hamburger you go pizza you go whatever he'll  know exactly yeah i'd love the best fucking place in in manhattan i'd love to try that if he's around

[02:35:30]  fucking creep zone it's a crypt you can just do anything down there yeah yeah oh it doesn't  matter disgusting you remember it really is awful down there and do you remember growing up penn  station was such a horror show that the that the uh the the dick lookers would line up against the  back wall when you uh would go in the bathrooms they would just line up it was yeah that was before  there was a police presence i'm saying like every so often a beat cop would walk around down there  but the swing in his billy club and just be like all right then i guess everything's okay down here 
[02:36:00]  but they would go back up they would have a line of urinals old school urinals no fucking uh no  dividers no dividers or nothing i remember this as a kid coming in for fucking concerts and stuff  and the pervs would line up against the back wall and just hang out there for like hours look at  your dick and they would try to take a look at your dick how many guys saw your dick after a nice  fucking queen's rike show yeah you're gonna bring up queen's rike again you cunt  fuck queen's rike silent lucidity and that's it one hit almost one i'm not even giving him that 
[02:36:30]  was that queen's rike silent lucidity wasn't it uh i can't even remember i'm thinking of  wait i'm thinking of winger do you remember my god you remember the guys though it just would line  up against the back wall well i never it would be a whole line of them too i was a very frightened  child so you wouldn't go into the bathroom into the bathrooms i never even went into like penn  station until i was old enough to come in for concerts and it was so obvious you'd go in there 
[02:37:00]  and go what the fuck these guys would just stand up against the back wall yeah they wouldn't approach  you nothing like that they were just standing there hoping to look at dick it's so we're not a line  or none of that shit there was an actual line and then you had the guys against the back that was  the great filthy city of of yesterday year yeah it's so fun station was a scary place when we  were growing up it still is not as bad though uh right but there are some nooks and crannies down  there like those stairwells that make too many turns yeah and and you're like how many rapes happen

[02:41:00]  this discussion why there's like a queensrike uh mafia out there they take this band very  seriously for some reason oh they do they really do there's a there's a little small group they're  a respected band man are they yeah amongst two people that like music they're very respected i  know that much they're real musicians they know how to play their instrument yeah so did poison but  they stink no they didn't really know how to play their instruments that's the beauty poison was 
[02:41:30]  awesome they are the definition of rock stars yeah but they didn't know how to really play their  instruments they played basic shit this is real musicianship cc deville could shred i guess doesn't  mean they were good with cc you know yeah but you know how many chicks they got they probably got laid  more than anyone else did in the 80s and that puts them in the rock and roll hall of fame in my book  you think cc liked uh girls though oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that was the whole thing that was the whole 
[02:42:00]  thing that androgynous whatever all right you can't you can't you can't rip brett michaels no  no it's on american brett used to do our show until he got hit in the head and then that was it some  sense knocked into him and i'm coming back on this fucking show did our show a lot and then he became  uber famous and said ah that was kind of when he was just starting to get that comeback  thing right uh you know reality shows all the time he did our show i was on one time with no more  with his uh security guy his bodyguard uh big john big john rules yeah i love big john i love all

[02:44:00]  you for the reminder uh de rosa thinks faith no more is one of the greatest bands ever they are  they're not i like faith i like the few of their songs he goes so fucking deep it's ridiculous they  aren't they're coming there better than queens right i'm not defending queens right oh gosh i would put  queens right and faith no more in the same category don't all right don't you say faith  no more it sounds like a 90s sitcom with a bad laugh track you know i'm not taking a divorce dad and 
[02:44:30]  five kids that's what it sounds like to me i'm not gonna debate here jerry i won't debate you i won't  debate you what's that from fargo that's right i'm not gonna debate you blood has been shed jerry  and then we challenge joe on faith no more and he tries to turn us on to a garbage song well can we  get a good faith no more track epic no epic stinks oh look at this oh you're that guy 
[02:45:00]  that's like when uh when charlie daniels years ago came out and the devil went down to georgia  was a huge hit every station was playing and all of my friends like in in junior high and  shit we're like you know i've been listening to daniels for years man that song sucks well  epic is not a good song look and i'll defend my taste you don't like that come on come on what's  wrong with this what is this epic i don't know this you know this is a big thing you know who does 
[02:45:30]  this little rap little metal you know this song together you get faith no more  no this does nothing for me i don't like this song either but i love faith no more  and i will i will defend myself there's your band in underpants by the way  you're getting them in the bad years you got to show them in the good years  i've ever seen that's like being like that's like being like queen sucks uh you know queen sucks i have 
[02:46:00]  innuendo terrible it's like you can't focus you got to focus on the right years yeah what is your  favorite faith no more song my favorite favorite we did this i think we did do this before but my  favorite faith no more song ever is probably midlife crisis from angel dust yeah all right i know that  one hear a little of that this sucks what what years is this it might it's 92 91 it sounds like no excuses the beginning of no excuses oh god 
[02:46:30]  it's all right there comes a time yeah what's the category of this music rock this is 90s  this is rindy's rock this is man music man no i like this song by the way yeah it's a  fucking great tune man i think i might like this better than epic yeah and i only have the basics  as far as faith no more goes i don't know much about it tell me you wouldn't prefer this over 
[02:47:00]  sweet drum woman what was that song called i don't like queen's right you idiot don't make me into a  queen's right fan i had a play sign of lucidity on the radio over and over again who's your favorite  band again favorite it always changes they're not my favorite band i love them alice and chains  might be my favorite band i always go back to alice and chains pearl jams up there i'm a nirvana not  so much these days i love mgmt if they would put out some you know another good album i didn't like 
[02:47:30]  their second album i didn't like it either but it grew on me i gotta say this with alice and chains  great band but i'm upset i missed the train on them i didn't get into them when they were out and  they're a hard band to go back and get into because it's so of that era it is really  fucking 90s really it's very 90s grunge metal it's hard to go back and get into it it's kind of like  me with uh justin bieber's early stuff you know that it was really cutting edge but it was just a  time period it's all it's all you missed the boat on that one yeah i was like i'll go back you 
[02:48:00]  that was spring it was spring you know what are you gonna do i love uh yeah it was the first two  weeks of april yeah yeah you missed them both you know yeah i didn't get into early rod stewart  soon enough so now i'm stuck in the forever young period i used to be a huge youtube fan but  i don't know they're still good man they're still maybe top five i guess i like shit like elevation and  stuff like that like this the last album just fucking yeah the last album kind of blow i 
[02:48:30]  couldn't even name a song off it and i'm a big fan i kind of liked what i heard off the last it was  better than the last couple albums they put out i thought it was better than like vertigo and  beautiful day i don't know i like vertigo you don't like beautiful day pretty good it's i know it's  poppy and all but it's fine it's not a bad song but i day is a great song elevation is a great song  i like that what i heard from you i'm better it had a little more of like atmosphere and mood  to it it felt a little more like what exactly are your rock credentials what's up what exactly are 
[02:49:00]  your rock credentials well uh i mean these terminology here that it's it sounds like you're an expert or  something it's not like you're like oh yeah i like that man i like that song you have like a lot of  reasons but i can't i don't know what they're adding up well they're a musician musician how  about this that's fair enough judah yeah you're you're top five my top five bands yes uh bad 
[02:49:30]  religion well i separate bands and solo artists my favorite solo musician ever of all time is frank  zappa my favorite band of all time is bad religion my second favorite band of all time is faith no more  wow um too cool for the room guy i love mike i love all mike penn's the singer faith no more i love  all the different bands he's been in i love i love sinatra i love that stuff um i love uh spoon is a  great band the pixies those are that's four right there those those are top top bands for me so that's 
[02:50:00]  four bands and two solo artists yeah but i mean that's a good top five of bands i also people can't  what's the one spoon song we know the camera one i turn my camera on that's a great tune man yeah i  know a little bit about spoon but you're saying one of your best favorite bands ever they've only  been around a few years right no they've been around for a long time they just got very they  got very uh i didn't know that very niche over the last few years but they uh they've been around 
[02:50:30]  since uh not since the 90s niche or niche i don't know i don't know i go uh niche i go niche i say  niche no i say niche i say niche because it sounds just skip classy i just skip it judah what do you  listen to i'm stuck in 80s metal dude any 80s metal i'll take name some bands well guns and roses you  got to go with guns and roses dude well you got to go with them to a certain point and then they  really what's a certain point if you think about it halfway through the use your illusion albums they 
[02:51:00]  really start to queef it up and get real meatloafy you better i kind of like dude dude i kind of like  that was a double offense there yes that was a double offense i like to use your illusion too  yeah you you used to queef and and and and fucking analyzing guns and roses that's one of the worst  things i've ever heard go to use your illusion right now use your use your illusion is awesome  it's ridiculously good i bought both those the day it came out and then when you get  tower records on fourth street when you got when you get bored with some of the songs on that then 
[02:51:30]  you're always finding another song that's just as cool and they're all like 10 minutes long i mean  that's awesome and i like meatloaf i don't give a shit i like meatloaf meatloaf i like bad out of hell  one and two no go to dude i love that i love that jim's diamond movie yeah music you know that uh  remember that movie uh it was with uh oh god she was so hot in it it was uh it was with michael  parade with streets of fire oh right right right and uh what's what's your name diane diane lane  yeah it was that the same guy did that music does all meatloaf's music i love that stuff we got the 
[02:52:00]  guns and roses you didn't like use your illusion too i like some of the songs i go to use your  illusion too but that's music illusion too has more dog shit on it than all right well let's look  at the uh list of songs here civil war civil war rules yesterday's is an amazing fucking song  their cover of knocking on heaven's door ridiculous get in the ring are you fucking  kitten that's a great song get in the ring locomotive was amazing let's go we're speaking  of music uh is there any uh strange strange is ridiculous don't cry absolutely you could be 
[02:52:30]  mine you could be mine what are you talking about you could be mine's one of my fight  what happened yeah oh we got that audio joe what's your favorite song i just saw the girl thing i  guess it was okay yeah we got we got but go to this again  they're well i want to know what joe's favorite song is to listen to while joe is queefing  well it's got to be something i've used your illusion too oh oh no you didn't listen to me  really quickly these albums stink you could go in 
[02:53:00]  shut your face but the safe the safe picks from use your illusion too civil war yesterday's uh  knocking on heaven's door what else would you uh is strange is an amazing train don't cry can i  interject and you could be mine let me interject with something that's a whole album of hits right  there that's on the second side knock it on heaven's door stunk when it was originally recorded  by who did it bob dylan or whoever that song stinks i'm with joe on this one that's no appetite 
[02:53:30]  it's no appetite that's not even out here no that's not even lie those songs you could absolutely  they could absolutely hang with some of the songs from that appetite was amazing come on they're  different yeah  and opie i agree with you 100 thank you this is as good as appetite or better oh man no way  come on no way that's like saying that that's like saying it's different that's like i don't 
[02:54:00]  know if you have the intellect for this album yeah i'll be quite honest with you yeah yeah  i'll be quite honest with saying this is better than appetite is like somebody saying lemon by you  too is as good as the ship from joshua tree it's just right now you just spoke my line no but  that's what he's saying appetite absolutely is by far right here one of the greatest albums ever  made look at the list usual illusion two the songs we just listed come on look at the list for fun 
[02:54:30]  no way look at the list for fucking appetite appetite welcome to the jungle it's so easy paradise  city night train you idiot night train yeah i can't see it i'm just rattle off from memory you  didn't know night train so you skipped it uh mr brownstone brownstone my michelle you're  fucking crazy come on that's a great album sweet shot rocket queen come on come on you're gonna  compare that to listen to this shit that's playing in our ears what's wrong with you could be mine 
[02:55:00]  nothing but that's not what we're playing that's why you can't relate this is why you can't relate  to the album joe okay why seriously okay see their first album that's one that was their big their  first hit their explosion the second one is sort of their rocky three they've already made it they've  experienced success and excess and you just can't relate so they're not working out in the  basement anymore i will say this speaking of rocky every time somebody defends use your illusion they  defend it the way somebody defends rocky four like it's got good parts i said rocky three you know 
[02:55:30]  what can i uh that was a great one let me say about that yes yeah let me say this if you take the  best songs from use your illusion one and two equal maybe better than fucking appetite for  destruction the problem is they put out a double album there's more good songs yes more good  songs that's the problem i've made the argument many times that if they took the best songs from  each album they could have put out one great album but they were stroking themselves out two great 
[02:56:00]  albums oh no man no no this is like yes joe but if they put it together as one album it would  have been one of the one of the greatest albums of all time when i hear one of you wearing low you're  wearing low top converse chucks and that is going to disqualify you from criticizing guns and roses  oh shit give me the list for use your illusion one we only did white sneakers yes that's the 80s  the 80s soda look at this okay live and let die 
[02:56:30]  stinks wow maybe use your illusion two is better  it's never rain oh frank what's better wow you know what i think i like use your illusion two  better you know what guys although i love two has more good stuff on i love dust and bones  it's a very underrated guns and roses song guys you're right because i always thought what guns  and roses was lacking was more since thank god for these two albums  that's what it needed i'm i'm with joe on this one these albums are like this is like appetite is 
[02:57:00]  like is like rush fly by night 21 12 and this is like rush hold your fire and power window  it's not that much of a drop-off yes it is it is not it's got its moments but it's not  you could be mine is a great fucking tune you know what they did wrong they didn't start the  album with it oh what's that what's that is this in the song oh this is great they have a little 
[02:57:30]  sound effect voicemails in the middle all right maybe that wasn't a good idea all right maybe that  part wasn't i think it has a whole other layer that most people don't even see ah guys i think chinese  democracy is the best guns and roses album followed by the spaghetti incident well that goes back to  what you're saying earlier about every band has their time you know what i mean it's like yeah they  had yeah guns rose had a few great albums and guns and roses time was track one of appetite to 
[02:58:00]  track 12 of appetite and that was it wrong you're fucking crazy  every band fucks it up in the end people get so mad shut the fuck up joe like i'm just reading  shit fuck him fuck you exactly exactly dick yep wow comments 100 they are not digging you joe now listen  listen for for those of you that like the gnr later years like this stuff i i'd also like to 
[02:58:30]  recommend great white i'm not even going on anymore fuck uh meatloaf backed back into hell  whatever the fuck it was great  queen's last three albums are fantastic  uh what else yeah what the show must go on or that that song where he was dying and he  knew it and the most depressing music i've ever heard horrible holy shit 
[02:59:00]  these albums are like when fucking snapple came out with all the other flavors you're like you  know what guys the iced tea was plenty good for me that was fun by me right more importantly we  learned that your freelander likes meatloaf yeah oh yeah that that by the way that statement you made  about snapple and guns roses is maybe the most defensive thing i've ever done yeah i'm not 
[02:59:30]  even acknowledging he's talking right now yeah you lost me i mean that's just you're you're  equating use your illusion to like the grape snapple yeah it is to that babe by the way grape  snapple my favorite fucking snapple flavor yeah that's where the whole thing right there that with  kfc it's perfect oh god i'm telling you right now what are we on what's happening  are you an extreme fan no yeah you are no i i knew it the guy that the guy that ruined van halen 
[03:00:00]  ruined it i didn't think it could get shittier than van hagar and then gary strong was like hold  on let me give it a shot and just what was wrong with van hagar oh i'd go david lee roth van halen  absolutely but he pulled it off van hagar right now on to me tomorrow oh god it's that  fucking muppet that fucking muppet hair douche that is love not a big sammy fan oh god go back to the 
[03:00:30]  island and drink your fucking combo get out of my face not a fan huh i thought i thought he pulled  it off david lee roth wins over hagar yes but you're still way out of line thank you said joe  wow way out of line you're very angry about what flavor is uh what flavor is sammy hagar sam  hagar sammy hagar is like if they put out prune flavored snapple 
[03:01:00]  wow you really don't like him you just turned into a cock today i'm not being a cock  it's bad hangar it stinks we like extreme it's okay oh god extreme what was their song  wholehearted oh they had two hits that were nothing like they wanted it to be like they  wanted to put out hard rock so they put out two of these like ballads hoping that that people bought  the album and they were like hey this isn't the fucking ballads yeah this is like the rest of it  they tried to be hard remember remember nuno used to be a friend of ours nuno bettencourt he used 
[03:01:30]  to do our show a lot there's a hole in my crotch where my dick used to be  uh i'll say yes yeah somebody get in there you like this joe  who is this what's wrong with you extreme yeah the extreme this uh oh god it's got that black  betty bass kick hello black betty ray my man i'm not into this this is uh some 12 string action 
[03:02:00]  you don't like this this ain't doing it for me yeah we got a new one de rosa yeah i feel like  ryan in baltimore priest or maiden oh uh you know what i like them both i'm gonna go with maiden  i'm gonna go with maiden all right i'm gonna go different bands they're different bands  i'm going with priest all right and one of the reasons you ever see the movie heavy metal parking  lot oh yeah no great movie yeah it's just stoners uh and getting like getting just getting wasted in 
[03:02:30]  the parking lot in 1986 before judas priest concert in maryland i grew up in maryland that's like the  place how do you how do you find that film that's it there's actually an official dvd release now if  you go on youtube they just have the trailer but it's a it's only like a 17 minute movie but it's  awesome these guys who had basically went undercover uh they basically just said hey we're from mtv  and they just filmed all these like people drug down their mind a lot of these fucking like throwing 
[03:03:00]  up they're like madonna's got a dick docking rules yeah crazy chicks showing their tits and  it's it's it's just it just captures the moment of like the 80s metalhead better than anything i've  ever seen it's only like a like a 15 minute movie what's your favorite priest song dude i like so much  and they're in so many different ways i like metal gods i like i mean i i like i like i can i put on 
[03:03:30]  their live album i just listen the whole thing driving to that man were you surprised when  halford came out of the closet or did you suspect it a little bit before it happened  i didn't really give a shit but i mean were you like really or were you like i knew that guy was  gay yeah yeah no i i had no idea yeah no idea yeah and who gives a shit he's not gonna suck your dick  but i don't care nobody but back then like but like when i was in like high school and stuff that  that that thought like never even like occurred to me but but that's just it like no one went like 
[03:04:00]  oh dude priest that no no no like i don't mean it like that i just mean did anybody go was anybody  like like suspecting he was gay no i don't think so really yeah no he was like the he was like the  metal guy not a chance i mean forget about it yeah he's just the coolest i think it's kind of  amazing that his fan base accepted that well i don't know if that's close-minded but i'm kind  of amazed by that i don't know enough about him to like like at the time like what happened if if 
[03:04:30]  they did if there were problems but now i don't give a fuck and i don't think they really gave a  fucking job the thing is we had halford in here he couldn't have been cooler dude here's the thing  though he's probably here's the thing though he his audience was older at the time he was already  past the fucking 80s but in the 80s right i think if he came out then he would have been like  faggot i'm not listening to that faggot right but but they you know people grew up and were like oh  he's gay who gives a shit right right right i grew up listening to that wasn't there a backlash at 
[03:05:00]  the time and then people got over there parking a lot yeah yeah oh this is hilarious  yeah look at the old heavy metal parking lot this takes me back this looks like my high  school parking lot look at this yeah they got their shirts off like danny  yeah it's just getting fucked up god i think you just turned a lot of people  on to something today dude it's a great movie yeah this one's great man 
[03:05:30]  oh look at look at the firebirds and camaros no dude yeah i mean those are the coolest cars man  yeah if you had a trans am i still think i might get a trans am i might just say  fuck it and buy a trans am dude yeah classic trying around that hat in the trans am man  yeah it's fucking great that yeah that was the car those are the cars that camaro trans am  shit like that i think you had you had to drive a dodge dart 
[03:06:00]  those are still cool dodge dart like now you like a good yeah now  now that's how to drive a dart is now now it's like in high school it sucked ass i think when  i was in high school like the the general the shittiest car was the chevette the chevette  was considered the shittiest  i'm dm i'll be i'm 20 years old i'm ready to rock  that guy's that girl's 14 yeah she says she's 30. i know what the fuck is wrong 
[03:06:30]  i'll be in the air force in about two and a half weeks oh boy he's dead  what's your name and she's now 40 by the way  where are you from where are you from where i'm from from i'm sure i know people in this  probably though because this i mean this is where i grew up and this is the years i was in high  school hey at the end of this don't they go to one of the guy's houses i can't remember and 
[03:07:00]  he's like got a band and he's all old and shit i think so maybe they would recently they went back  and filmed some stuff yeah i think they did that so i first saw this movie like 15 years ago or  something but but they did an official dvd release so maybe they caught up yeah i think they did i  never got the original i i had a bootleg vhs of this in like the 90s you know yeah it's cool  cool flick the hair is hilarious it just takes me back in my neighborhood these people were uh  were called burnouts they weren't they weren't called we called them burnouts yeah we called 
[03:07:30]  them burnouts yeah and where'd you grow up uh long island okay yeah because we used to turn burn out  yeah we we the word pothead wasn't used no not even headbanger it was it was like burnouts you  know not stoner yeah nothing like that burnout was the term burn out and that's not everywhere  because i've asked people from like different parts of the country it was only in certain certain  pockets that term yeah i'm here at judas priest row my accent's like half new york half maryland 
[03:08:00]  it's crazy how similar that accent is to philly like i know people in maryland there are a lot  of big similarities because yeah you don't say uh let's go to the park over there you go you say over  yeah you don't say we're gonna go get a fucking keg over there dude yeah yeah they're they're  they're similar yeah i just want to watch this damn thing yeah yeah no it's worth the watch it's 
[03:08:30]  what this guy's one of the best get me my denim priest jacket yeah let's hear this guy yeah this  guy's one of the best in the movie oh yeah  is that steve perry he's got the great steve perry hairdo guys a dc 101 yeah a dc 101 yeah that  was this station back there it's the best motherfucking single see he's so he's a guy 
[03:09:00]  though he's a guy though that alford came out he'd be the first guy to be like that fucking faggot he  would probably be beyond that it would probably freak him out so much yeah you know he might you  know just join the marines the next day yeah yeah you know what i mean that guy would be gone  and go to business school or something what the fuck is that shit i'm joining the marines 
[03:09:30]  motherfucker live in after midnight that guy's so dead he's not around anymore  that's great yeah heavy metal parking lot check it out that's fine the guys that did that  they did a uh uh they did a follow-up called neil diamond parking lot where they  that's great where they just interviewed the people waiting in line to go see a neil diamond  concert total opposite yeah that was funny too that was like a seven minute movie or something 
[03:10:00]  yeah that guy's freeze frame on his face is great that guy he's i think he's my favorite  he is a good one we're we got the dave grohl thing and also de rose is going to sing for us today  oh no i'm gonna have to go to the bathroom  do you want to sing now i don't care sure do we have uh we have any stuff oh yeah what are you  singing joe i'm singing common the easy by the commenters i don't have the lyrics though but i'll  just come up okay oh it comes up on the screen up and everything like a real karaoke well the reason

[03:22:30]  they have to  just from the length  of the length of time  yeah it's gotta be right  I don't know  I mean  Foo Fighters  every album  they have a huge  fucking hit  at least one  from every album  there's fighters  in the name of the band  and he's  yelling at the guy  for fighting  well this  it's not Foo Fighters  excellent boy  it's Foo Fighters  the guy was just  sticking to the  he was Foo Fighters  you deserve a shot  for that  I feel bad  oh please  I feel bad  for the guy  that got kicked out  that's like  but this guy 
[03:23:00]  hit me in the head  and called me a faggot  yeah  I wouldn't know  why he's fighting  I'm defending myself  you fucking asshole  if you can't fight  at a Foo Fighters concert  where can you fight at  yeah  where the fuck  can you fight  Nirvana has sold more  still  no  several million more  yes  several million more  but you know  Slim Whitman  beats them all  that's where the fuck  Slim Whitman  I don't know  that was a commercial  years ago  sold more albums  than the Beatles  and Elvis combined  it's Slim Whitman 
[03:23:30]  and he'd be like  he's like a yodeling guy  that's like those  old commercials  when they'd be like  the highest selling  comedian of all time  Victor Borga  and his piano routine  I'm like  that was funny dude  I'm not trashing  but I was just like  who the fuck is this guy  now they can argue  Victor Borga  I'm gonna tell you  there's a lot of people  that use instruments  in their comedy  that guy's been doing it years  I'm not trashing it  it was just like  how much did I have  got sucked  I would lug a piano  around with you though  alcoholic Joe 
[03:24:00]  rules  what do we got  Slim Whitman  well that's Andy Kaufman  is introing him  actually I sent in  for the album  and when I got it  I just fell in love  with it  I went out  and I bought  every single album  I could find of his  and he's now  one of my favorite singers  is this Andy Kaufman  doing one of his jokes  that nobody guessed  it's got  exactly  it's like come on  Slim Whitman  listen to Slim  Slim Whitman  was a real 
[03:24:30]  or is a real musician  oh yeah  I don't know  I don't know much about music  pictures of you  on TV  and now I'm meeting you  in person  it's a cool jack  see this is a gimmick  this is a fucking  it's a work  it's a song I did  years ago  I remember you  I remember you  that one  that would be cool  that would be cool  Sebastian Bach  Sebastian  I love that song  so more albums  than the Beatles  than Elvis combined  this guy 
[03:25:00]  Slim Whitman  that's what they said  you  Slim Whitman  is the Victor Borga  of shitty acoustic rock  and a little  trivia for you  actually  Slim Whitman's music  was what made  the alien heads  explode  in Mars Attacks  it was?  yeah  no it was  no it was Tom  it was Ben  Bennett  wasn't it that?  it was Slim Whitman  it was this  were they making fun of him 
[03:25:30]  or were they just saying  the frequency of it  maybe  the frequency  and they were making fun of it  do you have the same mustache  as Slim Whitman?  I think I do  I know  it looks like Slim Whitman  I need the pompadour  whatever  it's alright  and look at Andy Calvin's  like standing side stage  there's a spotlight on him  and he's just like  looking with wonder  at Slim  it's a work  he's goofing on Slim Whitman  gotta love a gimmick  you gotta love a gimmick  how do you know 
[03:26:00]  he's goofing on him  the genius thing  is going away  yeah it fades more  look I love Andy Kaufman  and I love Bill Hicks  but the older I get  the more that  that luster fades for me  because it just becomes  more and more like  stop jerking yourself off  man  you know  I feel bad  because they died  but you know  you know what I mean?  yeah  I know exactly what you mean  especially with Andy Kaufman  it's very like  27 year old angst  with both of them  to me  I'm gonna fuck the audience  in my own way  right  and it's like  the older I get 
[03:26:30]  I'm like  I don't have that  angst anymore  yeah like  stop fucking me  and that's why  you sang that song earlier  yes  he was being honest  to the audience  that was your core man  yeah it was from the heart  that wasn't a work  you wanna know the shot Joe?  no I don't  one was enough  thank you  at 9.45  that was a big one  that was a big one  that was a big one  but then you fucking  shut us up  with your voice  he was good  I tell you  when we were doing  that fucking  at the party  he got up there 
[03:27:00]  and I'm like  okay  talk about what  your singing training  background  he's very good  I mean I played music  for a long time  but I never took  singing classes  what music did you play?  I had rock bands  and stuff  I still have a band  Queensryche  Queensryche  Queensryche tribute band  Kingsry  Kingsry  you don't have a band  yeah I have a band now  no  no you don't  funeral in the mirror  I do  you sound like Jimmy  I'm serious  we're so used to  Jimmy sitting there  saying shit like that 
[03:27:30]  funeral in the mirror  what does that mean?  it's from a Leonard Cohen song  it's a quote from a Leonard Cohen song  fair enough  are you a Leonard Cohen  tribute band?  that's what tribute bands do  take a song  I'm not a big fan  I'm a hits guy  I'm a fucking hits guy  I'm a faggot  what do you want from me?  ah come on  I don't like things to be  a little too obscure  Leonard Cohen  Leonard Cohen's great man  what a voice  he's another guy though  like up until a certain year  and then it all went to shit  you know? 
[03:28:00]  no  I don't  maybe this is a good conversation  with your drunk friends  but we're sober  what do you mean?  oh shit  what do you mean?  oh shit  explain  I am stone sober  and I can say with confidence  Leonard Cohen is good  up until a certain year  in the 80's  it kind of went off the rails  a little bit eventually  but why?  I don't know enough  about his music  it got shitty  that song he did  called like  Democracy or Freedom  or whatever  when he started bringing in  like the  oh too political?  no it's just 
[03:28:30]  he started bringing in  like the gospel singers  and it was very synthy  and it just wasn't good anymore  everybody knows  I think is the cut off  of Leonard Cohen  I think that's the end  alright  I hate when bands  get political  do you?  yeah  but you're such a  no when I see you too  and I'm like okay  instead of Bono  talking about Africa  for the last four minutes  he's on a rock  he could have done  Red Hill Mining Town  by the way  Slim Whitman sold  120 million albums  is that true?  it's on Wikipedia  Opie  how many have 
[03:29:00]  the Beatles sold?  I don't know  that's that  that's that whole  middle American market  man  like it gets so  discounted  and like people  are huge out there  120 million albums  it's impossible  because none of us  know who he is  really  oh I knew  I was the one  that brought him up  name a song you did  Rosemary  Rosemary  that's a Slim Whitman song?  yeah  it's a big single  that's like  it's a big hit  can we hear it?  it was number one  in the UK for what 
[03:29:30]  how long?  UK charts  8 weeks  the longest  the longest  his 1955 hit  Rosemary  held the Guinness Book  of World Records  for the longest time  at number one  in the UK  until Bryan Adams  broke the record  in 91  from 55  wait wait  no fuck  oh he broke  the record  in 91  how long  is he  yeah but  know what you just said  crazy  he still got beat  by Bryan Adams  what Bryan Adams  beat it  what Bryan Adams 
[03:30:00]  song  cuts like a knife  summer 69  it said in the 90s  so it's a later song  yeah  91  91 was  might have been  that lovey dovey  one that everybody  was using at that wedding  yeah  yeah I'll do it  I'll guarantee it's that one  all for love  all for one  and all for love  oh god almighty  that song stuck  did that suck  who was it  it was Bryan Adams  Rod Stewart  and who was the other guy  yeah another one  that  I don't know  here's Rosemary  this is a big one 
[03:30:30]  do we know this one  oh yeah we know this  number one in the UK  for the forever  that's in fucking sanity  I love those statistics  though did you know  Back in Black by ACDC  has been on the billboard  charts since it was released  it has never left the charts  it hasn't left the charts  that's like  that's like  Dark Side of the Moon  was always that big  fucking  yeah yeah  like that was on 
[03:31:00]  the fucking  I think longer than any other  yeah  this was always there  yeah  it's cool  right Slim  what's Slim doing  with his money  is he alive still  yeah 87  Andy Kaufman  on Letterman  singing Rosemary  in a diaper  and a  fucking  turban  it's annoying 
[03:31:30]  I  see  people are laughing  why  and he'll go through  the whole thing  it's annoying now  that whole like  he was just  lightning in a bottle  it was just  he was ahead of his time  Joe  it was a moment  you know  it's like  oh Christ  alright enough  we get it  and he's gonna sing  the whole song  like legit  well that's why 
[03:32:00]  I love the quote  in the movie  when David DeVito  goes  yeah big fucking joke  that only the two  of you are in on  what's the point of this  like  yes  eventually it's like  yeah dude  like  what  no this is all  you're gonna  oh there you go  sing that song  Rosemary  Rosemary  Rosemary  you know what  what  I'm for getting 
[03:32:30]  the fuck out of here  alright fair enough  Boston Africa  what the fuck  are we doing  fair enough  Judah Friedlander  is gonna be at  Caroline's this weekend  yeah  starting tonight  tonight 10 o'clock  tomorrow 10 30  Saturday  8 and 10 30  and Sunday at 8  212-757-4100  30 rock  going well still  we're on break  Tina's  her book is  fantastic  yeah I read it  it's funny  she's a funny broad  she's just funny  I don't have to 
[03:33:00]  add broad to it  she's just funny  yeah I think her book  is in the top 10  on Amazon  and mine's in the  top 50,000  so I'm pretty happy  about that  well yours came out  a while ago  yeah yeah  it did well  yeah I know  I see it at  Urban Outfitters  oh okay  that's my target audience  Urban Outfitters  I see it in there  though  no no yeah  no they did  they did sell it  there but  yeah no so  when does 30 rock  go away  no we're on break  no I don't mean it  like that  but there's  a bunch of guys 
[03:33:30]  in the news  hinting that  maybe one more  year  really  oh yeah  yeah there was  some misstatements  or misquotes  or whatever  we're guaranteed  for one more  season  but I don't think  we're going back  on air  until like  November  December  or January  because Tina's  having another  kid  so that's  delaying our  production by  like a month  or two  chicks in their  fucking uterus  how's Tracy doing  I don't know  I haven't talked 
[03:34:00]  to Tracy  you haven't talked  to him since  the controversy  no no  we haven't been  taping for two  months so I  haven't seen him  I figured you guys  might talk  yeah yeah  no we do talk  but I haven't  seen him  usually like comics  just like with Joe  today I see Joe  all the time  I see Joe  probably once  or twice a week  but I don't  have Joe's  phone number  but I see him  all the time  like when you  live in LA  all the comics  get each other's  phone numbers  but in New York  hardly anyone does  because you see  each other like  all the time  so but I  haven't seen  Trey at all  this summer  so I haven't  talked to him  so okay

[03:39:00]  or are we off the air  I have no idea  I mean  figure it out  you're talking into the mic  why would you talk into a mic  if you think we're not on the air  this is like a joke  where  you know what I mean  like even if I'm wrong  it doesn't matter  like I'm not  there's really  there's no egg on my face  you look stupid either way  yeah it's true  fucking  you know  you're just such a dick  but that's a compliment Joe  no I know  I know  I love you  look maybe we are on the air 
[03:39:30]  if you say I'm a nice guy  then I feel all uncomfortable  and stuff  that's how you really get me  this joke is like  it's literally like  if a tree falls in the woods  it's like  who gives a shit either way  you know what I mean  is that the real answer to that  I don't know  yeah I guess so right  I care if it makes a sound  do you  yeah  why would you  why would you  Judah left  everybody's gone  Judah thought we were off the air too  Judah thought we were gone  everybody did  why am I the most cold  well because you've been here for a while  this is the same joke  Opie always does  over and over again  he doesn't like  he's never done it to me before 
[03:40:00]  I never  oh really  we don't think he has  you probably left  and then we did  I walk down with him  every time  and then we make a silly video  most of them  never make my channel  we make a little  we only made  we only made one video  thank you  did you hear what he said  yeah I heard it  most of them never make it  that's an insult to you  we only made one video ever  and it went up  and it did  it did very well  it did very well Joe  it did very well  no it did very well  it really did very well  what do you want to talk about  on video today  whatever man  I might post the 
[03:40:30]  the easy thing  let's talk about  the karaoke thing  no  we gotta think  something else  there's a billboard  in Times Square  let's talk about  Queensryche  and how much they stink  you wanna  there's a huge billboard  in Times Square  for that movie  with Jason Bateman  and uh  the uh  switcheroo  the switcheroo movie  yes  you wanna try to  film something right now  sure yeah  let's do it  why don't you get in a diaper  and have him sing  Slim Whitman  I got thoughts  on this dumb movie  where they switch roles  it's the married guy  switches role 
[03:41:00]  with the single guy  but I have a problem  with these movies  we said this the other day  because the married guy  will never  now that he's a single guy  in the film  will never fuck anything  because they have morality  in Hollywood  they can't totally commit  to a storyline like that  they said that that's why  they did this movie  because for the first time  they're gonna actually  do the thing  where the guy  fucks the other guy's wife  and the other guy whatever  no because in the trailer  it's getting to the point  where the married guy  then there's some  hocus pocus  becomes single guy  switches roles  with his friend right 
[03:41:30]  right  they show  that guy  now  with a chick  in his apartment  and they're ready  to have sex  and then she has  explosive diarrhea  and that was the excuse  to get out of having the sex  well that's just in the trailer  maybe there's  are you really  hearing that they're  actually gonna  in an interview  one of them  or both of them  said  we never  nobody ever  takes it to  the guy  fucking the guy's wife  they never do that  and he goes  that's why we did this  they even said  they even said  we know this premise  has been done a million times  but we did this 
[03:42:00]  because we felt  that it finally  went into the places  that nobody ever went to  they actually said that  so they blow off  the dumb morality thing  I think so  they say dumb morality thing  because when I'm watching a movie  I don't give a fuck  about morality  if it's a good storyline  with a married guy  who's miserable  because you know  he's not having sex  and he's raising kids  and all that  switches roles  with his  with his  you know  his single friend  that he's jealous  of  then have him  having sex  you know what  I don't have a problem  with that movie  my problem is  that movie  friends with benefits  it's the same thing 
[03:42:30]  they just made that movie  they just made it  and I'm just sick  of these fucking movies  with two perfect tens  well that's what it is  it's just two really  good looking people  that you can stare at  for two hours  yeah it's like  what's the worst case  scenario here  the two perfect people  get together  and fall in love  like I don't understand  what I'm supposed  to relate to  I'm not invested  in this whatsoever  why can't we just  have sex  oh shut up  it's so  oh it fucking bugs me  and in both of those  they make it like  where the chick  is the one being like  I just wanna  I just wanna bang  you guys are so clingy 
[03:43:00]  it's like  shut up  real guys girl  you're stupid  alright we could try  to film that on the street  but if you're saying  that they're actually  gonna go the distance  I don't think they're gonna  you know what you do  I really don't  by the way  if we're not on the air  right now  this is the  it's sadder for you  why  that you would take it  this far  I'm hoping this wasn't  on the air  guess what  it didn't go that well  I was hoping that  we'd have a little chemistry  and now  now I'm glad  we're not on the air  Joe  I would never rerun this  was this a try out  Jesus  Jesus  you really go right 
[03:43:30]  to mean  what  you take it right  to mean  that's my flow chart  what's your flow chart  it goes right to mean  it goes your time  where's the start  something happened  right  and then it goes  was it good  was it bad  and then it goes  say something mean  and then it goes  right to mean  okay  I was doing a  Kaufman bit  see  see what we did  right now  you got some  blueberries over there  you got blueberries  what's wrong with that  ah geez  let's go do a video  all right  we'll do a video  the virus  Sirius XS  Sirius XS 
[03:44:00]  Opie and Anthony  the Opie and Anthony show  damn it  damn it  damn it </pre>
