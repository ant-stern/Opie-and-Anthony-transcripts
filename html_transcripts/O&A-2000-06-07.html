<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Whip'em Out Wednesday," a listener-participation segment where women flashed their breasts to drivers displaying "WOW" stickers.  Numerous callers recounted their experiences, detailing successful "wow" encounters, including one man who was flashed by two women in a Corvette.  The segment also included calls describing other related events and a giveaway of a Razor Rollerboard scooter to a lucky listener.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a recently apprehended serial killer, punctuated by the playing of a humorous song about serial killers. This was followed by a caller sharing a disturbing story about finding human remains, and another detailing severe marital problems, culminating in a suicidal caller contemplating taking their own life. The hosts engaged with the caller's marital issues before returning to lighter topics, including more "WOW" stories from listeners, one at a mall and another involving women flashing while sailing.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on listener prom night experiences. Opie shared his unsuccessful prom night, followed by callers recounting their own experiences, many involving sexual encounters. Alex described receiving anal sex at prom, while other callers shared similarly explicit details of their prom night encounters, both successful and unsuccessful. Jay, a caller whose 15-year-old daughter was attending prom, prompted sexually suggestive anecdotes from the hosts regarding their own teenage experiences and interactions with parental figures, including a story about a father who regularly dropped his daughter off at Anthony's house for sexual encounters.  The hosts frequently expressed disbelief and commented on the accounts.  The segment also involved a discussion of Gorilla Boy Jeff Norris promoting "WOW" stickers with NASCAR driver Kenny Wiles.

The show then featured a segment centered around a female caller, Anna, who professed a crush on Psycho Mark.  After much discussion and joking, the hosts arranged a meeting between them, with Psycho Mark duct-taped and blindfolded.  The reveal that Anna was actually a man led to a series of sexually suggestive interactions, including a "What's in your pants?" game which resulted in Psycho Mark unknowingly grabbing Anna's genitals.  The hosts and Anna reacted with laughter and shock, and further discussion ensued regarding Annaâ€™s transgender identity and experiences.  The segment concluded with further listener calls and advertisements for Mujan hair removal wax.

A call with Jeff Probst, host of *Survivor* and *Rock and Roll Jeopardy*, provided a brief interlude before the show returned to the Psycho Mark/Anna prank.  Anna's nude photos, linked to a website, were mentioned, along with sexually suggestive banter and jokes. Hannah, a transsexual woman, discussed her upcoming sex reassignment surgery. The prank, which involved a blindfolded Psycho Mark interacting with Anna (believing her to be a woman), resulted in extended riffing and listener calls, often featuring homophobic remarks towards Psycho Mark.  The show also promoted *End of Days* on pay-per-view and Sobe beverages with sexually suggestive language.  Further promotion of the "WOW" sticker campaign was also included, concluding with a caller partially disrobing on air.

The broadcast continued with a "What's in My Pants" game involving an 18-year-old caller, Susan, describing sounds made by rubbing her phone against her genitals.  The hosts and "Jeff, the gay guy from Jersey" guessed the sounds, accompanied by seagull noises.  The show returned to the "WOW" segment, featuring more caller experiences, often containing vulgar language and sexually explicit comments.  There was also discussion of a relapsed rehab patient, Amy, and more offensive jokes about Psycho Mark. The show concluded with a Razor Rollerboard scooter giveaway and a "What Did We Learn" segment, with callers offering humorous and often offensive observations, mostly revolving around Psycho Mark.

[00:02:30]  Look back to you again.  All right, Anthony.  Yeah, okay, terrific is right.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show!  Yeah, we're in a great mood today.  Beautiful day.  For Whip'em Out Wednesday.  I saw a wow all over the goddamn area today, man.  Yeah, more and more vehicles every day with the WOW stick around.  And then Wednesday, you just see them all. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you for the support out there, ladies and gents.  So many.  I was going to say, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah, I always get a lot of e-mail from people.  Happens every year.  They're like, hey, I've been seeing this WOW thing on cars on the highways,  and I see your call letters.  So could you please tell me what WOW means?  Oh, please.  Somebody doesn't know?  You put a WOW on your vehicle.  Either one of our stickers, or you make your own.  I've seen a lot of those, just a WOW written on anything. 
[00:03:30]  Taped to your window, taped on your backpack, whatever the hell, wherever you want to put it.  And if a girl sees it and feels so inclined, she will show you her bare breasts.  Ow!  Oh, come on.  Is she happy with my large boobs?  Yes, she is, Dr. Smith.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes, she is, Dr. Smith.  It is the greatest radio promotion ever invented.  Yes.  I challenge you to find something greater.  It's one where everybody out there with a sticker can be a winner, as they say. 
[00:04:00]  You don't have to be searched out to win a prize or anything.  You put it on your car, and that's it.  Yeah, we don't do stupid radio contests here, where we try to pull you over and give you $100 for having the radio station bumper sticker on the back of your car.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  No one wins those.  Please.  Hundreds upon hundreds of our listeners, every single day, win at the Whippin' Out Wednesday concept.  You win boobs, seen bare breasts, in the comfort of your own vehicle. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Mark!  Yell him.  Ah, our phones aren't working yet.  Now the button's all effed up again.  Okay.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  No, this is Bill from Westchester.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  What's going on?  I just got flashed by two beautiful blondes in a Corvette going down the Taconic Parkway.  There you go.  It's the one in back.  We're out of college right now for graduate school. 
[00:05:00]  I recently got divorced, and that was the best damn divorce present I've ever seen.  Is this the first time you've gotten wowed?  It's the third time.  Actually, it's the first time I've gotten through.  Wow, you're doing well out there.  I pulled on.  I told him to pull over, and unfortunately, he just had to keep going.  And I would have been late for class for that, no doubt.  He's in a TD-rich environment.  I guess.  He's doing well.  There's a lot of people out there.  We hear from you every week.  Hey, man, I've had the wow in my car for five weeks.  Nothing's happened yet.  Yeah.  Just be patient.  Just put the wow in your car.  Go about your business, and when you least expect it, you're going to see booms, most 
[00:05:30]  likely.  Booms.  I mean, we hear from the ladies every single week.  They're doing it all the time.  Guys love it, too.  Some of the problems the ladies are having, they're just not seeing enough wows out there,  Anthony.  You know, they dress appropriately for Whip-A-Mail Wednesday, and they're on the highway, but  they're like, look, I would have flashed.  I just didn't see any wows today.  Yeah.  I don't see any wow stickers out here.  Oh, what are you, insane?  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Trolling for breast.  Simple as this.  If you're a fan of the show, you just, please, put wow in your car.  That's all.  Yeah.  And just go about your business.  Because it also shows who the other psychopaths are that listen to the Opie and Anthony show  out there.  It works both ways.  He just farted.  Oh, no.  You cut the crap.  There can't be any farting in this studio.  You just did.  He thinks he's funny, man.  Why are you farting?  I didn't fart.  You know.  A lot of people on the radio want you to put their stickers on your vehicle. 
[00:06:30]  That's just the way it is.  Yeah.  But they don't give you anything in return.  No.  We're giving you nip.  No one I see all the time when I'm driving around with my wow sticker.  Why?  And people don't know who I am, which is cool, you know.  You're on the highway, and all of a sudden, like, you know, another person will pull up  to you, they have a wow sticker, and they'll just give you the thumbs up, like, all  right, man, cool.  Yeah.  You listen to those guys as well.  Well, I'm one of those guys, but yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Stop farting, man.  Get out! 
[00:07:00]  Oh, you people.  Hey, I've gotten a couple of emails so far.  I had nothing to do with the five women found in the 55-gallon drums.  I swear to God.  Did you hear about that?  Get the serial killer song.  First of all, because yesterday, we were talking, I forgot, to a couple of ladies, and I brought  up the fact, would you fit nicely in a 55-gallon drum?  I remember you saying that.  And then I turned on the news this morning, and in Missouri, I guess, five women were found  in 55-gallon drums. 
[00:07:30]  And believe me, I had no prior knowledge of this.  I don't know.  Am I being blamed for this?  I couldn't be in Missouri.  No, they already arrested the guy.  Yeah.  He was one of those internet freaks that was meeting women through the internet and then  throwing them in 55-gallon barrels.  And people wonder why when they say, oh, we met on the internet, people always give  the look.  Like, oh, really?  Because what is your image of a guy that's looking for girls on the internet?  Serial killer.  Serial killer, pedophile. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Pedophile, mass murderer, something.  I don't know where you would even go to find legitimate people on the internet, because  you don't know who you're dealing with.  You might as well just, what, people think computers are different?  You might as well just pick up the phone, dial random numbers, and go, hey, you want  to go out?  Because that's what it is.  That's the chance you're taking.  And this internet guy there in Missouri, they're saying he's the next Jeffrey Dahmer.  They found five bodies so far, and they're thinking there's many more.  What happens in your life? 
[00:08:30]  There's three.  That you're hacking women up and putting them in a barrel.  Psycho, Mark.  You know what?  They found three in another one of those storage places.  Can you imagine the stuff that are in storage places that they just haven't discovered  you haven't even seen?  Yeah.  Because you could seal them things up nice and tight with a gasket, and the smell won't  get out, Hopi.  I guarantee you that.  Hey, maybe it was Spaz trying to make some oil.  Some crude oil.  Oh, God.  Unbelievable, though.  I mean, what goes wrong in your life? 
[00:09:00]  That you have to hack people up and put them in barrels.  Uh, Bobby.  Yeah, hello.  How are you, Bobby?  Fine, fine.  Was that Hopi?  Oh, Bobby, let's go.  We're in a really good mood today.  Okay, terrific.  It's not like yesterday, where it was a crappy raining day, and we just flat-out sucked  in and pulled the show out of our butt.  I'm in a great mood today.  We need your help today.  Let's go.  We're down by the East River.  Me and my cousin Danny, we were just hanging out.  Yeah.  We looked down in the water, and I see this helmet floating.  So I pulled the helmet out of the water and had that guy's name in it. 
[00:09:30]  Sadie Way, whatever his name was.  That guy that fell off the Williamsburg Bridge with that accident a month ago.  Yeah.  We turned it in to the police, and the police tell us that some kids were fishing there  a couple weeks earlier, and they pulled the luggage bag out of the water, and there  were three different parts of bodies in this luggage bag.  Oh.  That was down by Red Hook.  All right.  Well, thank you for that, Bobby.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Did you see the instant feedback from Jonathan Slotsburg?  No.  You think it's true?  What?  I live across the hall from Spaz. 
[00:10:00]  He and his girlfriend went arguing for hours last night about her car.  I heard yelling about him about smacking up the front right side of her car.  I looked out the window and saw the damage.  Hmm.  Ask him about Beba's car.  Is that true?  No.  Hey, Spaz.  Quickly, if it's not true, I just, like...  Yeah, quickly, because we got the serial killer sorry.  Spaz, is that true?  Get over there.  Get over there.  I don't even think he heard you.  I got an email over here saying that you and Beba were arguing last night about the car.  No.  No? 
[00:10:30]  No.  Okay.  I didn't get home until late last night.  Oh, okay.  Somebody said that they live across from you or something.  No, we're isolated.  Oh, okay.  Well, it is close.  Okay.  I just want to like checking these things, making sure it's accurate.  If the authorities are listening, check.  Check.  Spaz's basement.  55-gallon drums with Beba number one, Beba number two.  Oh, Beba number three is in two barrels.  All right, Anthony.  There's a serial killer that has been caught, so we have to play the serial killer song.  Ah, we love when this one is able to be pulled out.  We only break it out when there's a serial killer in the news. 
[00:11:00]  Sing along.  Sing along, if you will, and we'll go to the phones next.  212-757-1027.  I made quite a splash, I hacked and I slashed, my way to the top of page one.  The cops even checked, but they didn't suspect, I was carving up fellers for fun. 
[00:11:30]  Guess I never thought I'd finally get caught.  I hope that they all rest in peace.  Cause I'm locked away, what more can I say, except what I told the police.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I got arms and legs and a few faces stashed all around in different parts of town. 
[00:12:00]  Well, I met them in bars on a friendly basis.  Now I got them in jars and flower faces.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I know I was wrong, I guess you've heard that one before. 
[00:12:30]  But the guys, they all dig me.  I'm like Eleanor Rigby.  There's a face in a jar by my door.  I must be insane, got an abnormal brain.  What else could I do to get laid?  The guys that I date had a terrible fate.  They ended up lightly sauteed.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. 
[00:13:00]  Every shape and size and all races, all blood and guts.  Man, I must be nuts.  Well, I got one that'll really kill you.  I'm the poster child for necropia.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  Oh, I really took you now, huh? 
[00:13:30]  Well, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I'm the that made Milwaukee famous.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  Gentlemen, Scott, you're wacky.  Are you mashing me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, that makes me tingle.  K-Man from Jersey on the Instant Feedback, Anthony?  Yes.  Hey, guys, no explosive diarrhea bits during dinner today.  Is that too much to ask?  Yeah, I was hearing that that was some pretty gross.  stuff to listen to during the dinner time.  You know, Steve from foundrymusic.com, the unofficial O&A website?  Of course.  He already has it up there, and I was listening to it while eating lunch today.  I was laughing my ass off, man.  The echo makes it.  The ambient sound.  Susie from Jersey loving the serial killer song. 
[00:14:30]  Now, we only break out when there's a serial killer that has been found or on the list.  Special occasion to him, yeah.  All right, Anthony, I think we're still in the middle of break here.  We got to talk about Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  Yes.  Maybe if this guy had, you know, some things to do in his spare time, he wouldn't be putting women in barrels.  Well, in Missouri, what the hell are you going to do?  Missouri.  I don't think Missouri has a Time Out Missouri, do they?  No, I don't think so.  Best places for cow tipping. 
[00:15:00]  What's the best line to use to date your sister?  Best place to dump a body.  Well, Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.

Oh, man, great story.  Remember you talking about people who have the wow sign in the back?  Oh, I never get wowed? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm driving down back from the shore, Saturday night on the turnpike.  I'm not saying things.  I forgot I have a wow sign in the back.  I'm right by the airport.  I'm in the truck lane.  I have a test if I'm coming home.  Also, I turn to my left.  There's a little, not a little car.  There's five boys in the car.  I turn to my left.  I got octa-sized.  Or octa-sized.  You got four women flashing?  Four women.  The driving is all fun.  The four women stood up, hanging out the window.  They wowed me.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:17:00]  Thank you, ladies, for helping us out with you from our Wednesday.  It was phenomenal.  It was like, I never got wowed before.  It was great.  They started blowing me kisses, and I started blowing kisses.  That was like the greatest thing.  I was like, I'm in.  I had a call to tell you that.  It truly is one of the greatest things ever invented.  Yeah.  Right.  But it's sliced bread.  You know, we don't pat ourselves on the back often, but we will.  Oh, but it was up.  Yes.  Was that something?  You see, the breastages slapping in the wind was very loud.  Breastages.  And they were from Pennsylvania, too, so I don't know.  I must say, wow is brilliant.  Got that right.  That's a high five on the top of the head. 
[00:17:30]  All right, Moe.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, wow is really, really cool.  We just want you guys to be safe out there.  You know, we don't want anyone getting hurt.  And guys, definitely don't harass the ladies.  They're doing us a favor.  Yeah.  You know?  Please.  Check out the wow.  Check out the boobs, and then move about your business, okay?  Move about your business.  Frank, you're next on N.E.W.  You guys rock.  Uh-oh.  I swear to God.  I downloaded the wow sticker from the website yesterday.  Yeah.  I put it on my truck last night. 
[00:18:00]  I'm up in Poughkeepsie, so we barely get you guys.  So I'm thinking nobody knows about it up here.  And I go to the mall.  I get out of my truck, and I go into my shop, and I come back out, and there's these two  girls standing by my truck, and I swear to God, and they're looking at me, and I say,  what's up, ladies?  And they, that was it.  And they wowed you.  Right.  They're in the middle.  I'm naming my firstborn, regardless of sex, O.P.  There you go.  You guys rock.  I love you.  Don't change, man.  No, we're trying not to.  What's up with the syndication, man?  Or is that taboo? 
[00:18:30]  Who gives a flying F?  At this point, who cares?  At this point.  You guys rock.  You guys rule.  Thank you, Frank.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, wow is definitely happening today.  It's in effect.  I think everyone's in a good mood after that crappy, crappy weather yesterday.  Horrible.  My God.  Rainy, nasty.  Now it's beautiful out.  Absolutely beautiful.  And some feedback from Matthew.  Un-effing-believable, guys.  I have your wow sticker on the wall in my office.  Today, a chick that works here comes into my office, shuts the door, whips out the fun 
[00:19:00]  bags, and says, it's Whip-Em-Out-Wednesday.  Right?  I have always wanted to do this.  Needless to say, it was effing awesome.  The sticker also works well in parks frequented by chicks.  I took the other sticker and stuck it to my shirt while jogging.  About three miles out, a girl running towards me lifted her sports bra, showed the boobs,  and kept right on going without missing a beat.  You guys are God.  Keep up the great job.  It's an occasion when we invent Cokehead spelling bee.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that ain't going to happen.  No.  No, no. 
[00:19:30]  No.  No.  Not Cokehead.  We haven't heard from Amy, have we, or her mother the other day.  I would really like to know what happened.  Yeah.  I think Amy's sister listens to the show.  If you could give us an update on Amy, we'd appreciate it.  We love Amy.  Spelling Bee in the middle of Stoner Spelling Bee.  She was the champ, as you remember, last time.  So we played the other day.  She was coming back to defend her title, and she got pulled before the festivities started  to be dragged back to rehab. 
[00:20:00]  And she was released from rehab that day, but they found Coke in her possession.  Yeah.  So they dragged her back to rehab.  In the middle of the game.  It was kind of an awkward little moment for the O&A show.  I think we're putting some type of retrospect together.  Oh, good.  About Amy's.  In case people don't know the full story.  All right, Andy?  Great.  Hey, George.  Hello.  How are you, George?  Oh, guys.  How are you doing?  You were talking about the Whip and Out Wednesday before I get into what I wanted to say.  Down Astoria Park, they call it the strip down there.  The girls stand on the side of the strip, and when people pass by with the wow signs, 
[00:20:30]  they whip them out like three, five girls at a time.  Nice.  Awesome.  You guys are great.  Listen, I'm pretty depressed, and I don't want to bring down your show, but when you  talk about how the guys get it in their mind to chop up girls, girls can make you the maddest  on the earth.  My wife walks up to me, and I work 16 hours a day, and tells me, oh, I don't want a divorce,  but I want you to move out.  What?  What does that mean?  That's what I'm saying.  She wants my benefits or something, you know, so she can keep the medical benefits, but  she don't want me around, and keep paying the rent, too, while you're at it. 
[00:21:00]  So that's a little bizarre, huh?  Dude, and I'm like, you know, what, do you got another guy?  You can tell me.  I'm not going to freak, you know, which I'm ready to just bounce all over her.  Right.  You know, and she's like, no, it's not that.  I don't feel loved.  You know, you don't take me out.  I'm like, I work 16, 18 hours a day.  How long have you been married, then?  Five years.  Five years, and it's already like that?  Yeah, and two kids.  Oh, my God.  She's killing me.  I want to kill myself, but I want to kill her.  I want to chop her up and put her in.  I'm not going to do it.  No, no, no.  I'm crazy, man.  Oh, you know, that'll only be worse. 
[00:21:30]  Georgia!  Hey, Georgia!  I need help.  I don't know that you're a psychiatrist or anything, but if there's, like, any women  out there that want to console me, I need to bounce.  I swear to God.  Dude, punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  You got to bail.  What, I said leave?  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, it's over.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  If a marriage gets to the point where your wife is telling you to leave the house, there's  no counseling or anything that's going to make it better.  That marriage counseling is a bunch of bull crap.  Take your losses and move on.  I bring home flowers when I come once in a while. 
[00:22:00]  She lets them die.  Well, they do.  Oh, no.  Plants.  Plants.  They put in the yard.  Oh, plants.  Yeah.  Nice house.  I pay everything.  I come home.  I dump the money.  I don't even put any money in the pocket for myself.  I dump all my money on the table.  Should we call her?  No, dude.  You'll kill me.  I know you.  Well, see?  It sounds like you still want to work it out.  I want to love her forever.  Why is she asking you to move out, then?  She hates me.  Well, it's over, Johnny.  All right.  All right, George.  What did you do? 
[00:22:30]  What did you do, man?  There had to be an incident where she now hates you.  In the beginning, I mean, I was vulgar.  I called her the C word when I was mad.  I stopped doing that.  You called her the C word?  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't like that, man.  Come on.  It does not help in a relationship.  Anybody out there listening, don't ever use that word on your wife.  Or somebody you plan on loving for life.  We know that.  That's it.  I think that's what killed the relationship.  But, yeah, no, you best cut your losses.  But the thing is, oh, the kids.  Oh, he's got kids.  That's awful. 
[00:23:00]  Dude, I love my family.  I love the style.  I go to work.  I get up at 4.30 in the morning.  I'm on the road by 5.  I'm in work at 6.  I work till, like, 3 o'clock.  And then I go to a second job.  I get home at 10.  She doesn't even have an hour to spend with me because I'm sleeping for the other five.  Oh, wow.  Get a girlfriend.  Dude, I can't.  I don't know what to do, man.  Yeah, get a chick.  Get a chick on the side.  Dude, when I was in court, there was a case before mine.  And the guy had one kid. 
[00:23:30]  And he's there with his wife and the lawyers between both of them.  And they are arguing, I swear to God, about how many minutes this guy is going to spend with his kid during her birthdays and stuff.  It was the most brutal.  I'm sitting there going, thank God.  I don't have any kids.  And the kid was right there, too.  No, no.  Dude, I feel like shooting myself.  But then the kids are going to know, oh, Daddy killed him.  Don't shoot yourself.  Dude, I swear to God, man.  I'm, like, ready to take a gun, put it in my mouth, and blow my head off.  No, dude, I'll tell you, that is, like, there are so many other options before you get to that point. 
[00:24:00]  Dude, did you ever cry?  What?  Did you ever cry?  Uh, when?  Ever.  When I was a kid.  No, I mean, other than that, when you became mature.  Have you cried?  Yeah, I'll admit it.  I've cried.  Yeah, when you meet a freaking kid, I've beaten the piss out of people all my life.  Oh, see, the chick is getting to you, dude.  She's killing me, man.  I'm broken.  Dude, move on.  No, I can't.  Move on.  Dude, she's got my kids, and I love her. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, let Ann and I talk to her.  Dude, she'd be worse.  It would be worse.  You've got to let us talk to her and see what the problem is.  I don't think you two are in a position to hash out these problems.  Dude, if she knew that I was talking to you, it would be totally detrimental to my relationship, even further.  George, your wife's not a reporter on Channel 4, is she?  No.  Well, it sounds to me like it's pretty bad.  Like she really is ready to leave. 
[00:25:00]  But, dude, all I did was I was vulgar.  I was vulgar.  I was vulgar.  I used to see where this, F you bitch that.  Oh, you can't say that.  I'm sorry, dude.  No, I mean, you can't say that to her.  I know I can't.  I know it now, but I've repented.  I haven't done it in God knows how long.  Well, have you told her this?  Dude, I told her.  One time, and she wants to fight like a man sometimes.  She threw a pot and hit me in the head while I was running away from her down the stairs.  Did you ever lay a hand on her?  I only once or twice.  Oh, see?  Dude, I haven't touched her. 
[00:25:30]  Oh.  I haven't.  She stayed with me for four more years.  I haven't done a damn thing.  George, you're wrecking our buzz today, man.  I know.  No, I didn't want to do it, but you brought it up.  How can somebody want to put somebody into a barrel?  Dude, I tell you, every thought is going through my mind.  I would never do it.  I'm a real man.  Because then she'd be gone, you'd be in prison, and your kids would be growing up doing drugs.  That's exactly...  I just can't...  I can't see myself, you know, but I feel it.  I feel it, man.  Punch out.  Punch out, Maverick.  I want somebody to punch me out.  Escape.  One of your listeners come and punch my face in, break my nose up, put me in the hospital. 
[00:26:00]  I need a freaking vacation from reality.  Come on in.  We'll take care of it.  We'll take care of it.  No, we can't do that.  Dude, somebody break my spell with a baseball bat and put me out of my freaking misery.  George, George.  It sounds like you've got some issues.  Yeah, and people are saying that you're getting...  All right, man.  I love you guys anyway.  Thanks, George.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, boy.  People are in true hell.  This isn't Ann Landers.  Come on.  Absolutely not.  Help us out a little bit, will you?  Get laid.  Get laid.  Let's go to Wendy on line four. 
[00:26:30]  Wendy, what's going on?  Hello?  Hi, Wendy.  What's up?  No, it's Wendy.  Oh, what's Lisa?  Lisa.  It's Lisa and Wendy from Valley Stream.  Oh, okay.  Hi, guys.  I just want to tell you that we take a sailing class every Wednesday in Oyster Bay, and we  sail topless just for you guys.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Wow.  I've heard there's wowing going on on the water, too.  On the high seas.  Yeah, a lot of people putting wows on their boat and stuff.  There's a street that's right there, and everyone who passes by can see us. 
[00:27:00]  Nice.  I know where you're talking.  How many...  So a lot of people have seen your fun bags, huh?  Oh, yeah.  We're attacking the sky, the water, and the roadways.  Yes.  Yep.  Air, sea, and land.  We would love to see a picture of that if one of you ladies want to send a picture,  and that would be great.  Send a picture?  Well, I don't have any pictures on me and my boobs, but I'll definitely take a picture  and send it.  All right.  We love collecting the wow photos.  There's a lot of them on the unofficial website, and we need more.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thanks, Liz.  Hey, hold on. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, no.  The hold on.  Oh, not the hold on.  The hold on.  Keep a lookout.  We're going to be flashing.  This is Jen speaking now.  No, it's Wendy.  It's Wendy.  Oh, it's Wendy?  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, usually, like, she'll, like, flash, and then I'll flash, but then, like, she'll just  flash, and I'll just moon.  All right.  Well, when are you guys going to be flashing?  We're going to be flashing any time between 4 and 7.  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  That's when we sail.  4 to 7 in Oyster Bay, so look at it.  All right.  Sail close to land, and if anyone sees you guys, wow, and please give the show a call later. 
[00:28:00]  Awesome.  Thank you, Wendy.  Thank you so much.  All right.  There they go.  The girls that sail topless, Anthony.  Nice.  Prooch.  Prooch?  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  We're just over here barbecuing over in Cresco, New Jersey.  You got to see it.  It's crazy.  We got, like, 30, 330 packs of Budweiser.  Oh, it's nuts.  About 20 people here.  Girls going crazy, wowing.  It's nuts, man.  Cool.  You got to see. 
[00:28:30]  I got wowed twice on 17th South by the way over here before I hit Route 4.  Sounds like a wild party going on behind you.  Oh, man.  It's crazy.  You don't understand.  Yeah, it's real crazy.  First I got wowed by these three girls, but then I got wowed by this Jameet.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  It's over, Jan.  Yeah, you're gone.  We finally got that sound effect for the show.  I'm so psyched.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  I just got a disc in one of my computer gaming magazines full of classic games, and some 
[00:29:00]  of them are hysterical.  Like, you look at this, and it was only back, like, 92, 93, some of these games.  Two.  Where's Don?  And some of these games are hysterical.  Like, the Duke Nukem 2.  Mm-hmm.  Two.  Two.  Two.  It was like a scrolling game, like Super Mario Brothers.  And then they show the new one?  Oh, we've come a long way.  But you think it'll be fun to play them, too?  You're like, oh, I remembered this. 
[00:29:30]  I remembered Age of Darkness 1.  Let me boot that up.  Mario Brothers is still fun.  Going from left to right.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink.  Fun for five minutes.  And then you boot them up and play them?  Yeah.  Yeah, you really need a Pentium 3 600 to play Super Pong on.  But you start playing these games, and it's like, oh, hey, you know, this sucks. 
[00:30:00]  No wonder we had such progress in the past 10 years.  Because they get boring real quick.  Then I go right back to Half-Life, Opie, where I can kill in peace.  Anthony, we've got a guy on the line.  We'll talk to him next, Matt.  He's upon his prom night.  And he needs our advice.  Very good.  You've come to the right place, Matt.  Prom night advice up next for Matt.  Make sure Matt stays on the line, okay?  Also, it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:30:30]  We all know that by now.  Lots of action on the highways today.  I mean, people are calling in like crazy.  More than past weeks.  That's cool.  The WOW thing is exploding all over the tri-state area.  If you want to get a WOW sticker, Masbeth Queens was really, really good to us a couple weeks ago.  We're going back there.  Oh, yeah?  Taking it back to Masbeth.  Yeah, because they've been nice and kind to the OWN-A show.  So, Gorilla Boy is going to be at Mid-Island Electrical, 5415 48th Street, Masbeth, Queens.  I hope that makes sense to somebody out there, okay? 
[00:31:00]  He'll be there at 4 o'clock giving out the WOW stickers.  Mid-Island Electrical, 5415 48th Street, Masbeth, Queens.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Boobies, ta-tas.  We like breasts overinflated.  Go on and do it.  Here is your big chance to show them.  On the roads you're causing mayhem.  You've got some breasts we want to view. 
[00:31:30]  Go on and show them.  Take them out and let them play now.  Cause you know it is Wednesday now.  We want to see those cans on you.  Go on and show them.  Go ahead.  Give it a try.  We'll look for you when we're in our car.  Just lift up your shirt and prop.  Go on and do it.  If you're in a Porsche or Camry,  just go on and show us your memories. 
[00:32:00]  You're gonna wow us.  Where are you?  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  It's Wednesday.  Don't show just one show, too.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  It's Wednesday.  Make all our dreams come true.  On N.E.W.  Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One bad tour. 
[00:32:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  1027-WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Brand new sponsor to the O&A show.  Something we've been loving.  Something we've been using all over the studios lately.  Yes.  We're talking about the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  Yeah, these things are a pisser, man.  We are having fun with these.  It's our transportation inside the building.  Yeah.  You know how a lot of people, you know, you walk around your office. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, there's no need to walk.  We ride.  We ride.  We're riding on the Razor Rollerboard Scooters.  These things are great.  Gleaming stainless steel, aluminum inline scooter.  The wheels on them are like inline skate wheels.  Yeah.  They're like a roller blade wheel.  And it looks cool.  It's like very polished stainless steel and aluminum.  And the thing tools around, man.  We go down the hallway.  We're like hitting each other with a...  It has a little brake on the back wheel, so you can slow down if you feel like it. 
[00:33:30]  Does it?  Yeah, a little bit.  I have never used the brake.  You haven't discovered that feature yet.  You know what I use for a brake?  See the closet down at the end of the hall?  You slam right into it.  I slam into it head first.  It's hysterical.  It's the hottest new product this summer.  There's articles about these things in all the hot magazines, by the way, Anthony.  And they're made for the street, really.  I mean, we've been using them up and down the hallways.  But you're seeing a bunch of people using these damn things all over Manhattan.  John, on Instant Feedback, no, we're not selling Little Rascals. 
[00:34:00]  No, no.  This is not a Little Rascals.  No, it's like...  Dope.  It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  Yeah.  It's almost like a thin skateboard with, like, handles.  With a little steering handlebar thing.  But it's adjustable height and everything.  It packs up to really compact size.  And it's fun, man.  Yeah, it really is.  We're having a blast around the office with this thing.  A lot of fun.  The Sharper Image.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Available only from the Sharper Image.  Visit one of their stores.  Go online at SharperImage.com or give them a call.  1-800-344-4444.  Also, Anthony, you know, we're so into this product.  Why don't we give one away right now?  Cole, why don't we give one to the 10th caller?  212-757-1027 for the Razor Rollerboard Scooter, okay?  Yes.  You can also win by visiting any New York area Sharper Image store and filling out an entry blank.  Each store will give away five razors on Sunday, June 25th. 
[00:35:00]  No purchase necessary.  Winner need not be present.  We're talking about the Razor Rollerboard Scooter from the Sharper Image.  Boobs.  The world's universal language.  Opie and Anthony, your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  M-E-W.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It is WOW. 
[00:35:30]  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Wow.  We're going to be giving out WOW stickers at Mid-Island Electrical.  Pittsburgh, 1548th Street.  Madsbeth Queen starting at 4 o'clock with Jeff Norris, the Gorilla Boy.  Tom from Teaneck, New Jersey was in Manhattan today.  Had the sticker on the car.  Limo pulls up and a gorgeous blonde pops up out of the sunroof and wowed me.  Effing incredible.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, guys.  We were talking about old computer games, Anthony?  Yeah.  Mad Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey makes a very, very good point. 
[00:36:00]  He says, guys, you want to know what's computers in perspective?  Watch War Games.  Oh, yeah, it was on last night.  When did that movie come out?  81, 82-ish, around there, right?  Yeah, early 80s.  Okay, watch War Games and then The Matrix.  How far we've come.  Yeah, he was using the old acoustic modem where you had to plug the phone receiver  and slam it into some styrofoam cups.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  I, unfortunately, am old enough to remember that. 
[00:36:30]  You dialed up your phone, took the receiver, and shoved it into this big thing,  like a cradle for your phone, after you heard the modem on the other end.  Yeah.  Connecting at a whopping, what, 2400 baud.  Oh, tops.  You were flying if you had the 2400.  You're cranking text on the screen almost as fast as you can read it.  All right, Anthony, let's go to Matt.  Matt's going to his prom tonight.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Prom night, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, give us the details. 
[00:37:00]  What high school?  Cardoza High School, Queens.  Right on.  All right, you got yourself a date, obviously.  Yeah, I'm going with my girlfriend.  We'll call her Wendy.  Okay, and your girlfriend of how long?  Not too long, about a month.  About a month, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  Have you gotten any action yet?  Minimal.  Have you gotten patch?  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean?  I got to patch last week.  You got to patch?  Yes, yes.  You got your hand down her pants?  Yeah.  Now, did you get to patch, or did you go a little further and get to pet the poodle?  I pet the poodle. 
[00:37:30]  Pet the poodle.  Let's just say, were you able to count all five fingers of your hand while you did it?  I was not.  Oh.  Oh, look at you.  Okay.  Interesting.  Very good.  Very good.  But no sex?  No.  No.  Okay.  I don't think I'll be doing that tonight either way.  What?  Have you padded the canoe driver on the head?  No. 
[00:38:00]  You haven't touched his bald head?  No.  You didn't?  No.  But you just, but wait, wait, this isn't making sense.  Well, maybe he doesn't really know what's going on down there.  Do you know where the canoe driver drives the canoe?  Guys, I don't know what he'll be driving.  See, I thought so.  I see.  If you're a little older, you're not.  It's the most sensitive of the most intimate area of the woman.  See, we're putting a visual in your head.  I got you.  There's a canoe, if you know what I mean, and a canoe driver, and he's always at the back 
[00:38:30]  of the boat.  Yes.  Right.  Have you touched him on the head?  Um, I believe I did.  Okay.  Okay, good.  And has...  You rub that head for good luck, right?  Has she reciprocated by putting her hand in places?  That's the problem.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Okay.  She hasn't put her hand down your pants?  No.  All right.  I got...  Have you grabbed it and tried to shove it down your pants like Bill Cosby did to  that chick that went up to his apartment?  No.  That worked. 
[00:39:00]  Come here, baby.  Grab my pudding pop.  Maybe I should have said, what are we going to do about this?  Well, I don't know.  That was the advice I was going to give all the kids going to their prom tonight.  If she's shy enough not to touch it, I think you may frighten her if you just pull it out.  Now, how far has she gone with you?  Yellow?  Hasn't really done anything.  But you...  What was she doing?  You put your hand down her pants. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I did not get the reciprocation.  Any dry humping, as they call it?  Oh, naturally.  Where you get on a couch somewhere and you start rubbing against each other through the  pants?  Naturally.  Boy, that leaves you hurting.  Oh, you don't even laugh.  You get the, what they call blue balls open.  Yeah.  It hurts very much.  And then you get chafing.  Oh, really?  I had never heard of that one before.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm explaining to you.  Hey, wait.  Let me write that down so I can tell everyone what I learned on the show today.  I'm explaining to everybody using you as the person I'm talking to. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, I see.  Okay, Sophie.  I learned that in radio school, too.  Put a picture of the person you want to talk to and communicate with.  Put a picture.  In the studio.  If it's a family, put a picture of a family that you cut out of a magazine in front of you  doing the radio.  And that's your audience.  It gives you someone to talk to.  That's what they...  Shut up.  That's what they taught me in college.  I'm like, shut up.  That's great.  I like putting pictures of porn stars up so that way you can talk to them.  Yeah.  So, you've done that.  Was she into it when you added your hand down there? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, definitely.  She was into it.  Definitely.  Oh, God.  This is a tough nut to crack open.  I understand this because she's kind of really shy.  Obviously, a virgin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe more liquor.  Roofies.  Roofies.  No, no, no.  Um, does she drink?  Um, we'll find out later today.  I don't think so.  Oh, wow.  That's even tougher.  Yeah.  I've been predicting.  Has she, uh, has she promised anything for the prom? 
[00:41:00]  Actually, she has.  What?  What?  Uh, I should be getting a Hummer.  Come on.  Then you're set.  She's...  What?  She won't touch it, but she'll do that?  Apparently so.  It's prom, though.  How did she tell you that she was going to do that?  Well, um...  Give me the exact words.  She's a listener to the show.  Yeah.  And, uh, hopefully she's not listening now.  And, uh, I said something to the fact that, um, uh, how about you induct me to the Tuesday  Night Hammer Club?  And she says, but I won't see you on Tuesday.  I'll see you on Wednesday. 
[00:41:30]  Oh.  That sort of sounds cryptic, though.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean she's going to do it.  She just said, I'll see you on Wednesday.  That's right.  Well, let's, uh, let's keep our fingers crossed and see what happens tonight.  All right.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to bet you're going  to get some action tonight.  Have you, uh, have you been, uh, obviously excited in front of her?  Oh, yeah.  Naturally.  And what does she do?  Look at it and go, huh?  No, she just, you know.  Have you, have you, uh, have you, uh, rolled over and, like, shoved it against her leg or 
[00:42:00]  something?  Maybe I should.  You haven't, you haven't done the spaz move yet, have you?  No.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's a tough one.  Yeah.  I'm going to predict them in here, guys.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Where are you guys going after the prom?  Uh, to a club.  To a club?  Do you got hotel rooms or anything like that?  No, then we're going to the beach.  Oh, the old beach.  Yeah.  Pulling sand out of your ass.  Yep.  I did the beach thing.  It didn't work too well for me.  Um. 
[00:42:30]  That's the prom.  Uh, uh, what, like 20, 30, uh, going to the prom?  Going to the beach?  Yeah, pretty much.  Probably a Catholic school.  Right.  You might want to bring, uh, like, uh, like, uh, a blanket or something.  Doing that, definitely.  Okay.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  I, this is the hardest advice I've ever had to give.  I don't know.  I figured you guys would be able to help me if anyone would be able to.  Well, let's, uh, we have someone in the studio that might be able to help you.  Hold on a second, okay?  Hello, Matt.  Hi, it's, I am Mike Grayson.  Hey, I am Mike. 
[00:43:00]  I, I've been with a couple of women that, uh, sound similar to your, uh, lovely girlfriend.  And, uh, what you got to do is treat them with patience and tenderness and loving care and, uh, right hook.  Cause once they're in drastic pain, bleeding, and semi-conscious, they become more receptive to the Louisiana black snake.  A lion Mike. 
[00:43:30]  Should I punch you in the uterus, Iron Mike?  Well, no, but now you're getting carried away, Matt.  First, a couple of light body blows to the breakfasts.  Use them like a speed bag.  Watch.  I'll demonstrate on my new hose bag I'm here in the hotel with.  Here, like this.  Shut up!  And then some, uh, light body blows.  Working your way down, lovingly.  You know, you start with the face.  And then the body. 
[00:44:00]  And work your way down to the uterus.  And wind up, I mean, pull this punch from Mississippi.  And then, win right into the uterus.  And then she won't care about something as small as a white man's penis.  Good luck, man.  Thanks, Iron Mike.  Hey, uh, Matt, a lot of people checking in saying you gotta use the Jay Moore line.  If she's a friend of the show, maybe you could do it, but keep your, like, your pants on.  Oh, for the record, I'm, uh, two for two with what we can do about this.  You are?  Then go three for three.  What the hell?  Who are the lucky guys? 
[00:44:30]  That old gag.  Yeah, try the, what are we gonna do about this line?  I don't think that's gonna work with her.  Why?  Yeah, she's, uh, she hasn't been listening that long.  Oh, really?  She's not familiar with the Jay Moore episode.  Would you like us to give her a call to see if you're gonna get any action?  Hey, we'll help you out.  Uh, that's quite all right.  Damn, why don't people allow us to call their girls anymore?  If I'm not that stupid, guys.  Hey, when you go to pin her corsage on?  Hey, does she have a father? 
[00:45:00]  A what?  A father.  A father.  Yeah.  You gotta go pick her up with the mother and father there?  No, we're meeting somewhere.  Oh, you're lying on?  Yeah, I've met the parents.  They're cool people.  You're so lucky.  Why don't you go to the house like they do in the movies?  I hate that.  You gotta go to the house and there's the father ushering his little girl out the door  knowing she's probably gonna come back limping.  It's like, it's like the gazelle, uh, you know, giving their young to the lion.  Oh, man.  You know what the best thing to do is?  You go up to the father before you leave and ask him if he has any condoms. 
[00:45:30]  You got any condoms?  I don't know what this bitch has.  That's a good icebreaker with the pop.  Why?  It works well.  That works, right?  You're sitting there watching TV, you know?  Bonding, watching a little, uh, hockey, maybe the Stanley Cup or something.  And then you break out that line, right?  And then you break that line out.  Maybe I should ask, uh, what a daughter likes to drink.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Louie, Louie's a limo driver. 
[00:46:00]  He's seen a bunch of proms.  He's got some...  Oh, that's a good guy.  Yeah, he's got some advice for Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Uh, Louie, sorry.  Louie.  Yeah, listen, I'm a limo driver.  I've been doing this for a very long time.  Prom season is nothing, all right?  All this kid has to do is give the limo driver a hundred bucks, limo driver lock the doors,  put the music on, he's done.  Even if he wants condoms, limo driver usually has them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just got to get over the penisophobia that she's got.  Yeah, that's it, man.  Don't be afraid.  Just go for it, you know? 
[00:46:30]  Believe me, everything works out right, I think, by the end of the night.  All right.  Thanks a lot, Louie.  All right, Louie.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right, Matt.  Well, you're on your own.  Let us know what happens tomorrow.  All right, I'll give you guys a call.  I might be a little, um, not able to call you guys tomorrow, but I'll call Friday.  Yeah, that's cool.  All right.  I'm betting you get some action.  I'll let you guys know.  You've got to call up and tell us the truth.  We don't want, we don't like people lying on us.  I'm a faithful listener.  I've been listening for almost a year.  I would not lie.  All right, cool.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  All right, later, guys.  All right.  Hobson, Hobson, do you have any condoms?  I think I'm going to get lucky. 
[00:47:00]  Nothing worse than having to meet the dad.  I like girls without fathers.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  I've been lucky with that lately, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the girls without the dads that you've got to deal with?  One, two, three.  My last three girlfriends didn't have fathers.  You take care of my little girl.  Oh, yeah.  Don't worry, Pop.  I'll take care of a whack bag.  Whack bag.  Hey, Pop, does she like the yam bag on the chin or on her ass? 
[00:47:30]  Huh?  You brought her up.  Anthony, I think we got audio of Matt after doing it with his prom date.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Let me go to that right now.  Look what I did to you again.  How did Jamaican Mike get into that limo?  I don't know.  Butt sex.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Some butt sex.  Do you think there are people out there that have butt sex on the prom? 
[00:48:00]  Butt?  Wow.  I mean, that's really making the jump.  You know?  I mean, butt sex at the prom.  When you're at that age for proms and stuff, you're just hoping to get, like, pats or something.  Can you imagine that?  Is there anyone out there that gets, like, butt sex for the prom?  It starts with a gentle kiss on the cheek and a pinning of the corsage at the parents'  house and ends with butt sex?  How do you make that jump?  Butt sex.  I don't know, man. 
[00:48:30]  That's quite the jump.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I want to know if Anthony's going to be using these lines when he goes to the prom.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  Shut up.  Where did that come from?  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I usually control the calls a little better than that.  Oh, prom.  Pete, what's up?  Imagine how ridiculous I look at a prom.  Where's my scotch or something?  Give me a drink.  You know, that's another bit that, like, you know, just those ridiculous DJs do, though. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  They go to, like, the prom with one of their listeners or something.  We'll take you to the prom.  One of our lucky listeners is going to be going to the prom with me.  Yeah, that's just, and it's like, you know, just another example of really bad zoo, morning  zoo type radio.  Hey, we'll take you to the prom.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Pete.  Yeah, what's up?  Let's go.  Yeah, I want to tell Matt not to get his hopes up, man, because my prom, I had everything  set up. 
[00:49:30]  The girl told me I was going to get lucky, and that's where we coined the term.  F-O-C.  We got the LIMO driver and everything, and I struck out.  $800 later, I ended up with blue balls.  I think most people strike out on the prom, on the prom night.  It's amateur night, man.  It's like New Year's Eve.  Ah, yeah, you know?  Because all the girls are out.  The girls that do it and the girls that don't do it.  That's right.  You start off going to a bar and spending all that money on liquor, and you're getting  lucky with some other girl.  And I got to say, I have the girls that go to the proms. 
[00:50:00]  They have those F-me dresses on and stuff.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  The dressers have come a long way.  To them, in the pants, it's like this.  Might as well be.  It might as well be.  All right, Pete.  All right, man.  We have a guy that's claiming he got anal at the prom.  There's no way you're getting butt sex at the prom.  Alex.  Hey.  Remember, we don't like liars on this show. 
[00:50:30]  I swear, but you have to do the trick.  You can't be trying to score with your date.  What?  There's no way.  Everyone strikes out in the prom.  I totally agree with you when you go with your date.  But if you start to fool around with your friend's date, that's when you get laid.  Wait a minute.  You got anal from your friend's date?  We all were friends.  It was like a big group.  My whole crew of friends.  My friend, we're just going with her as friends.  We were drunk.  We got a little friendly. 
[00:51:00]  And then we started to take our clothes off in the bathroom.  And she gave me anal in the shower.  Butt sex.  At least it was in the shower.  She was a, can I say a W-H-O-R-E on the air here?  Yeah, you can say more.  There we go.  She was a whore.  No, she was a good girl.  Oh, yeah.  There's nothing wrong with her.  There's nothing like a good whore.  And you're getting anal on your prom night.  All right.  Well, thank you, Alex.  There it is, Alex.  Hopefully someone that got, uh...  But that's a technicality. 
[00:51:30]  That's a technicality.  Hussah!  It wasn't his...  Butt sex.  Hussah!  It wasn't his, uh...  It wasn't his date.  I'm sticking in my mouth.  Whoa.  What are you talking about there?  That's...  I don't know what you're talking about there.  Oh.  I can't see making the move in the traditional prom date where you go, pick up the date from the house.  You know, the mother and father are waving with smiles on their faces. 
[00:52:00]  A little tear in their eyes as the little girl goes off into the car and drives away on her prom night looking all nice.  And a few short hours later, we fast forward, backseat.  Butt sex.  I don't see it.  Oh, this poor guy.  This is what I'm dreading someday.  Thank God my wife's not born yet.  But many years to go.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Guys, you're killing me.  What's the matter?  I got a 15-year-old daughter. 
[00:52:30]  She's going to the prom for the first time Friday night.  Hussah!  Oh, no.  Are you just freaking?  I'll tell you what.  Friday night.  Yeah.  This kid comes to the door.  Yeah.  I'm inviting him in.  Yeah.  I'm sitting him down in the living room.  Yeah.  I'm going to be cleaning my gun.  That won't matter.  He'll be cleaning his with your daughter later.  Oh.  Oh, Anthony, you speak from experience.  It doesn't matter.  I remember going out with this girl, and her father took me aside.  He was driving me home one day. 
[00:53:00]  And he goes, yeah, let me drive you home.  And the girl that I was going out with said.  He drove the little short bus, right?  Yeah.  That's it.  She goes, my father wants to have a talk with you.  You know, I'm like, oh, boy, the talk.  You know, God, I hate chicks with fathers.  Now, wait, wait.  Is this the father that used to drop the girl off to your place so he could bang her?  Yeah.  Same girl?  But he didn't know that she was getting dropped.  It's a hilarious story, though.  You were what, 14, 15?  No, this was like when I was about 16, 17.  All right.  But the father would drop... 
[00:53:30]  I've got to hang up with him.  Yeah, I know.  He won't.  This is going to distract our story.  Stop talking.  Good luck with your daughter at the prom there, Jay, or whatever your name was.  Okay, listen.  Yeah, so he would drop his daughter off at your house.  Yes.  Almost every afternoon, right?  No, no.  It was the weekends.  Oh, okay.  You know, back at that age, you weren't doing it every day because there just wasn't a place  to do it.  But my mom was working nights on the weekends, so we used to have parties over the house.  So everyone would come over, play poker, and have their respective girlfriends and have 
[00:54:00]  sex with them.  So he would drop her off.  We'd go inside, and it was just like there was no time, so we would just run right to  the bedroom and do what we did.  And then he would come, pick her up, beep, beep.  All right.  Pick her up.  He's the pimp.  Exactly.  He was the pimp man.  He was doing the same thing that the guys do that drive the chicks around for bachelor  parties.  But before any of this happened, like, she goes, oh, he wants to have a talk with you.  I'm like, okay.  So I hop in his work van, and he's driving me home, and he's like this real mean-looking 
[00:54:30]  guy, and I'm just like a dopey kid and stuff.  And he's telling me, you know, you're a little older than my daughter.  Because I think I was 17, and she was 15, something like that.  And I'm like, yeah, no, I know.  And he's telling me about, you know, respecting her.  And blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, don't do anything to her, because you'll have to answer to me.  And all I'm thinking is, way big, way big.  That's all that was in my head as I'm looking at him.  And he's talking about this, because I know what he's talking about. 
[00:55:00]  He's talking about sex.  He's talking about teen sex, Opie.  Teen sex.  Teen sex.  And all I was thinking, and then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I hope he can't read my mind.  And I'm trying to block out of my head what I'm thinking, because I'm thinking of  his new daughter getting banged.  And I'm like, oh, if he can read my mind, I'm dead.  I'm sunk.  I'm trying to, like, think of a brick wall.  Yeah.  So he can't break through it.  Oh, man.  But, yeah, he used to drop her off.  No, Sean C. from Jersey. 
[00:55:30]  I think you were 33, and she was 12.  No.  No.  That isn't the case.  Thank you very much.  All right, Anthony.  Well, I see it on your face.  You're thinking of butt sex, aren't you?  It's my daughter.  I could read your mind.  Lots of great calls on hold.  If you're on hold, please stay there.  We need all of you guys today, okay?  Also, some girl that wants to meet Psycho Marks on line 10.  A bunch of other people that had anal during their prom.  If you're lying, we don't want to hear from you. 
[00:56:00]  No way.  No way.  If you're lying, please hang up.  You can't make that jump.  Take one for the team and hang up if you're lying, because we hate liars on this show.  That's going from sixth grade to college.  There's no way it happened.  You're making a huge jump.  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe now that they've loosened the rules and gay people can take their dates to the prom,  that's the only way you're getting butt sexed.  Yeah, we forgot to talk to the other guy.  Yeah, we never confirmed that it was a female.  I had anal.  Yeah, me and Bill. 
[00:56:30]  All right, Anthony Gorilla Boy is on the line.  He's at the WOW sticker stop.  Is he beating people up?  Gorilla Boy, where are you?  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, I'm over here now.  Sorry.  I'm over here now.  Hey, Jeff Norris.  What's going on?  We're at Mid-Island Electrical.  Yeah.  On 54th Fleet Street, Massapuca, Queens.  Massapuca, Queens, right behind the Kenny Wiles' number five NASCAR.  Go inside, find a plug, and stick your junk inside. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We're doing bench presses with the car.  I'm not lying with Tony Bloomfield anymore.  He's a nut.  All right.  But a quick crowd here.  We're handing out some stickers.  Come on down.  We'll be here for quite a while.  We got here early.  Okay.  Somebody else didn't drive, and we're having a blast, so come on down.  All right.  Wow stickers at Mid-Island Electrical, 5448th Street, Masbeth, Queens, with Gorilla Boy, Jeff Norris.  Oh, jeez.  Come on down.  And we have a NASCAR driver down there.  Yeah, Kenny Wiles, number 55. 
[00:57:30]  His NASCAR is parked right out front.  Nice.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Kenny Wiles.  I swear to God, man.  I'm both fear and fear out here.  You're watching Bunkett's hometown.  God, if we ever get syndicated, we're going to actually have to make believe NASCAR is  cool.  Yeah.  Hey, there's a couple cowboy hats out here.  I just don't get NASCAR.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I tell you, it's a good comparison.  This car goes like, what, 190 miles an hour?  There's not a scratch on it.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  It goes five miles an hour.  This thing looks like Fonzarelli drove it at Demolition Derby on Happy Days.  Opie only watches NASCAR when he jerks it.  Well, I did, well, yeah, there was that story.  Don't worry.  That we've told a few times, yeah.  New meaning for the word pit stop.  All right.  Thank you, Gorilla Boy.  We'll see you later.  Peace.  Get your WOW stickers in Masbeth, Queens today, Mid-Island Electrical, 5448th Street.  Jeff Norsbert's on a fine show at these WOW sticker stops, okay?  All right, Anthony, well, I guess we've got to take a break here. 
[00:58:30]  A lot of great calls on hold.  We'll get to them next.  Stay there.  Get ready.  Get ready.  Get ready.  And that's what's about the WOW state with Opie and Anthony.  N-E-W.  Powered by two shot shot jerks.  Armed by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027.  W-N-E-W.  Good finish, New York.  What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day.  It's Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  Today, you put WOW in your car, you got a good chance of seeing boobs.  Simple as that.  Hearing from tons of people today, Anthony.  The weather's very, very nice out there for WOWing.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing today?  We're doing great.  Okay, listen, just to let you know, I just got run out on the Long Island Expressway out  here in Suffolk County, so the word's reaching out here now.  It's about time.  Another great thing that's happening, too, out on Veterans Highway, around Kakuma, two 
[00:59:30]  young guys hanging out.  They got this huge WOW sign that they made out of, like, a refrigerator box.  Okay, these guys are, like, in the middle of Vets Highway holding this thing up, and they're  getting WOWed.  I stopped and I pulled over.  I gave them a couple of bumper stickers, a couple of the WOW stickers.  Yeah.  Because I had a whole bunch of them in the car.  Yeah.  I gave them a couple of real WOW stickers.  These guys are happy.  Oh, cool.  I think their name was Jack and Dave, or Jack and Dan.  All right.  But they're really cool out there, and they're getting WOWed. 
[01:00:00]  Well, thank you, Steve.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Have a great show and certification.  Ouch.  All right.  Bye.  See you later.  EJ.  EJ.  Yeah.  Hello.  So, you're claiming you had butt sex on your prom.  And the only reason why I got it was because she was a virgin and didn't want to give that  up to me.  Butt sex.  Stop it.  I kid you not.  I kid you not.  Oh, please.  What's the logic behind that?  It's like, oh, I don't want you driving my Rambler. 
[01:00:30]  Take the Ferrari.  Come on.  That's what everybody else tells me.  I swear to God, man.  I was with her about three months before.  It wasn't the first time I got it from her, but that's the only reason why I got it on  my prom.  Lovely.  Was she wearing a prom dress with a hatch in the back, like the feedie pajamas?  I don't know how to jump her.  Easy access.  You know, I'm going to believe EJ.  It sounds reasonable.  It sounds too crazy not to believe. 
[01:01:00]  How long ago was this, sir?  10, 12 years, I think.  Have you seen her since?  Actually, no.  Last time I saw her was about maybe eight years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, EJ.  You guys rock.  All right.  EJ got butt sex on prom night.  On prom night.  Brian.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up?  Talking to you.  What are you doing, precious?  Oh.  Listen, I swear to God.  I swear to God this happened.  It was about eight years ago.  I went down to prom. 
[01:01:30]  I took this girl as a favor because her boyfriend had just broken up with her.  She was 15.  I was 17.  This is a true story.  We're in Lavalette down the shore by Seaside.  I went to go mess around, and she pretty much showed me the way in the other direction,  and that's what happened.  And that's a true story.  Man.  I thought it was impossible to get butt sex on prom night.  It just sounds like quite the jump.  I thought so. 
[01:02:00]  I've been bragging about it for eight years.  How do you make that move?  You just kind of...  It took a while.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  See you later.  We're speechless today.  Honey, sit down and tell us how your prom was.  Prom with that.  He'll pop.  I can't quite sit.  Bill is claiming that he confused the areas, and that's why he got...  Confused the areas.  Bill, you confused the areas on prom night? 
[01:02:30]  Bill, turn down your radio.  God damn it, man.  Turn it down.  Listen to this idiot.  Turn it down.  Honey, sit down and tell us.  Listen to him.  He's listening to it at the radio.  Bill!  Bill!  Bill!  I know.  He's going to say hello any second because he's listening to himself on the radio.  Hello?  Hey, Bill, you jerk-off.  God, you guys, come on.  Everyone should know we're on like a 40 to 48-second delay now. 
[01:03:00]  Turn down your radio if you're on hold waiting to talk to us.  Isn't that something everyone knows, no matter what station you listen to or anything?  Like, at this point in time, everyone should know to turn their radio down.  All right, let's go to Anna.  Anna, what's going on today?  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up?  All right.  I've been listening to this for, like, years, and I have a big crush on Psycho Mark.  And I want to come up and meet him.  Get out of here.  No one has a crush on Psycho Mark ever.  You got a death wish?  You want to end up in a 55-gallon drum? 
[01:03:30]  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah.  Well, 5'11", blonde hair, and blue eyes.  5'11", blonde hair, blue eyes.  I don't know.  Do you have a nice body?  Yeah, I think I have a nice butt and nice legs.  Right.  Nice little boobies.  Hmm.  And you want to meet, of all people, Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark has a fan?  This is the first, man.  This is a first. 
[01:04:00]  Psycho Mark has a fan?  What do you say?  Can I come up and meet him or what?  Are you in the area?  Actually, I am.  I had to do some photo shoots this week.  Do you know?  Are you a model or something?  Yes, I am.  Do you know what Psycho Mark can do to a girl?  Huh?  Do that in your best Ted Knight voice, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you know what Psycho Mark can do to a girl?  Might end up in a 55-gallon drum.  Is that clear?  You know what Psycho Mark can do to me?  Whoa!  Get out of here.  You know Psycho Mark only likes guys, right? 
[01:04:30]  Wow.  Shut up.  All right, so now you're 5'11", blonde.  How much do you weigh?  How much do I weigh?  About 140, 150.  Well, she's tall.  She's tall, though.  Big boobs?  No, not quite, but three.  Shapely?  Enough?  Everybody says they're nice.  Enough to satisfy?  Yeah.  Most definitely.  They're really sensitive.  And you're into Psycho Mark?  Yeah, I have been for quite a while now.  Psycho Mark, right?  And we're talking about the same guy. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, he sounds so sexy on the radio.  Sexy?  He sounds like a psychopath.  Not for nothing, but come on down here.  I'll take you off on a chair.  And, like, can I come up and meet him?  Are you, like, she already said, how close are you?  I'm, like, right outside, actually.  Oh, Jesus.  Get out of here.  About two blocks away.  Your name's not Patty, is it?  All right, listen.  I can't.  I don't know.  Psycho Mark is a little thing. 
[01:05:30]  Please.  Please.  For your own safety.  We could maybe do, like, a prison visit or something.  I just don't trust Psycho Mark.  Do a little F&M stuff, huh?  Oh, man.  She's a goer.  Mark, you want to meet this chick?  Yeah, I don't care.  Whatever.  She can come up.  I can do it.  Would you go into the Jay Moore suite with Psycho Mark?  Would I?  Yeah.  I'd go anywhere with him.  Holy crap.  What the hell's going on?  Jesus Christ, man.  We're getting all the hanger-ons laid around here. 
[01:06:00]  Dude.  What do you say?  I'm curious just to see what she looks like.  I mean, why not?  Yeah, let me bring it up.  Bring it up.  Can we, like, tie you down or something, Psycho Mark?  Because I don't trust you, man.  You've got to put him in the Silence of the Lambs thing on the hand trap. 
[01:06:30]  Remember that?  Remember that?  Remember that?  It puts the lotion on the skin or it gets the O's again.  Remember that listener that wanted to meet us and we just didn't trust the situation,  so he, like, duct taped them to a chair?  Yeah.  If Psycho Mark will agree to that, we'll allow you to come up to meet him.  And then if you're deemed cool, then you guys can go, like, into the J. Moore suite or something.  Okay, and if not, then you've just got to tie me up and...  Oh, my God.  Look at Mark.  Wow.  Look at this.  All right. 
[01:07:00]  Good thing I didn't get sick today.  Hold down the line.  Rick's going to talk to you.  All right.  We've got to just make sure Psycho Mark is, like, duct taped to a chair before you come  up.  I think that's...  This is now good for me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, F.U. tools.  All right.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Rick's going to talk to you.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  All right.  Time to tape.  God, it's like the friggin' dating game in here. 
[01:07:30]  Two days ago, it was our own Lorenzo.  And today, it's Psycho Mark.  We'll get a chair and get him duct taped.  Let's do this.  Duct taped.  Wank, wank.  Wank, wank.  Wow.  All right.  Should be good.  Show gets wackier every day.  Zain-er-ific.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Butt sex.  Too much.  All right.  All right, we got the chair.  I smell a stalker patty, someone is saying, Psycho Mark.  Great.  Pat her down.  We can't lose the original Psycho.  Put her in the Lorenzo suite with Psycho Mark.  The Lorenzo suite.  Vinny from Rosedale.  What mental hospital did she come from? 
[01:08:30]  Kevin from Brooklyn.  Clear the building of all 55-gallon drums.  A crush on Psycho Mark.  It must be Stalker Patty's cousin.  Be afraid of this chick.  Very afraid.  Bring her in.  All right.  Well, they're duct taping him.  All right, Anthony.  That'll make a lap dance a lot easier.  Won't it?  Yeah, we've seen him at Privilege, though.  Yeah, the guy likes to grab ass is what it is. 
[01:09:00]  I've seen him at Privilege, too.  He had his hands, like, elbow deep in some of those dances.  Psycho Mark, this is only fair, because you grab every single girl.  You're not as bad as Old Dirty, but you're bad.  He was chixing around the intern yesterday that just started here.  I heard you got a talking to about that, huh?  That's the only way to treat him.  At least if she wants to, you know, put her ass by your hand so you can wiggle a finger, 
[01:09:30]  it's up to her, not you.  Wow, they're duct taping him good.  Get a picture of this for the unofficial website.  Yeah.  I'll take one more prom story, and we'll move on.  We'll get this girl in to meet Psycho Mark.  So, John, what's going on?  Hey, O&A, this is John from New Jersey.  I just got a quick little story for you.  Yeah.  I took this girl to the prom.  I had another girlfriend at the time.  I just kind of took this girl to do the right thing, and we went to the prom together.  After the prom, we went to my friend's house, and she disappeared for a little while. 
[01:10:00]  And at the end of the night, I went back to my limo to get a ride home,  and she was banging my limo driver.  Wow.  I wonder how many limo drivers get action on prom night.  Limo drivers?  Really?  I mean, she thought it was a big joke, because she wasn't, you know,  I just took her as a, you know, a friend type of thing.  But it was pretty funny to come out in a limo and see her tagging the limo guy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, true story.  Why didn't you get any?  Well, I had a girlfriend at the time, and actually the girl I was dating, 
[01:10:30]  her brother was in my class.  And my graduation class, it was her younger brother,  so it would have been awkward if, like, you know, she was there and her brother was there at the prom.  So she decided not to go, so I took a girl that was also graduating, and we went as friends.  Right.  And then, you know, one thing led to another.  I guess she liked the limo guy, and that was it.  Very good.  So I just wanted to share that with you.  Thank you, John.  I'm a little distracted, because I'm watching them duct tape Psycho Mark.  Well, Froy from Jersey, isn't duct tape going to hinder Psycho Mark's ability to air hump? 
[01:11:00]  From, I remember yesterday?  Yeah.  Air humping?  He was air humping.  That was the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.  Psycho Mark does the Beavis dance.  You ever see the way Beavis dances?  Yeah.  He, like, does that slap, that slap-ass thing, and then the air humping?  That's what Psycho Mark does around the building.  Let me see if you can air hump.  Can you air hump?  Oh, God.  Air hump.  All right, Ant, let's take a break, and we got a Psycho listener that wants to meet Psycho Mark. 
[01:11:30]  His shirt says, ride this.  Thank God, on her terms.  And yet, on the molester.  Boy, I'm glad Psycho Mark's got one of his tame t-shirts on today, Anthony.  What does that one say?  Ride this.  Ride this.  Jesus.  What?  I can't breathe.  Not for nothing.  Yeah, don't.  Not for nothing, but get this.  Freaking monkey off of me.  Hey, hey, Rick. 
[01:12:00]  Don't make it so he can't breathe.  No, he can breathe.  If he's saying he can't breathe, he can't breathe.  Make sure it's not tight, man.  All right.  He's in there good, right?  I'm fine.  What is it?  Be kind to retards week on the O&A show?  All right, so Psycho Mark, we'll meet a listener next.  He's just about ready.  Why are you going to blindfold him?  Whatever.  All right. 
[01:12:30]  Some people are saying...  There's some dildo in my mouth.  Saying it's that chick from Channel 4 News.  That would be hilarious.  Psycho Mark, don't jump around.  You'll fall on your head.  You should tape a pillow to the back of his head.  King Gimp.  Can we just tape his back?  Psycho Gimp.  Look at him.  He's bouncing around.  You're going to fall over, man.  You're not going to be able to put your arm out to help yourself.  All right, Ann.  Let's take a break, and Psycho Mark will meet one of our listeners next. 
[01:13:00]  Stay there.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  What is that?  Like some kind of guy's name?  Like some kind of sexist guy's name?  Yeah!  You will not get away with this!  I wish you could just shut your bitch up!  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday.  O-B-A-L-A.  Obi and Anthony.  N-E-W.  Anthony, brand new sponsor to the O&A show?  Yes.  We're talking about Mujan.  Mujan.  You might ask yourself, what the hell is Mujan? 
[01:13:30]  Well, if you're a lady?  Yes.  What the hell is Mujan?  Well, if you're a lady, and you want to get rid of some of the unwanted hair on your body.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Mujan.  Waxing is the difference between having itchy, scratchy stubble and silkier, sexier skin.  The world's most desirable woman, women wax with a convenient one-step botanical formula  of Mujan. 
[01:14:00]  Mujan.  Mujan.  So, if, like, you have a pool rack filled with Afro in your lap, right, you might want  to, you know, trim that down to a more reasonable size or something, right?  And the best way to do it, with Mujan wax.  Can be used a hot or cold.  It's the most comfortable way to remove hair, whether it's on legs, face, underarms.  Ladies will love Mujan.  No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate your skin.  Mujan, gentle, hypoallergenic Mujan removes hair completely open. 
[01:14:30]  Slow to grow back, too.  It doesn't grow right back.  Hair is lighter and thinner than with shaving.  You don't want to go down there.  Remember, remember when you were a kid?  Remember when you were a kid and, like, you were getting to that age where you were getting  a little old to be kissing your dad goodnight?  Ugh.  I'm, dude, I'm talking like when you're, like, like, like six.  I'm there.  Seven.  It's like, goodnight.  You kiss your mommy, you kiss your daddy, you go to bed.  I still give my dad a peck.  All right.  I said a peck.  All right.  It's in the middle of a live radio.  On the cheek, dude. 
[01:15:00]  Insert your own joke here for precious.  But, like, you don't want to be with your girl and feel that same razor stubble.  Yes.  That you felt.  Yes.  When you were a kid.  Right.  Mujan, it grows back a lot thinner and a lot lighter.  Better than shaving.  So, basically, if you're a hairy beast and you want to get rid of the hair, some of the  hair on your body, pick up Mujan.  It's very easy.  Right, Anthony?  Or if you're a sexy woman who wants to keep that area just so without the razor bumps and 
[01:15:30]  rashes, Mujan.  So you can wear those tiny, tiny little bikinis, right?  Yes.  All right.  Mujan is available at Duane Reade, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve's Drugs and Cosmetics Plus.  And if you don't see Mujan, just ask your store manager to bring it in for you.  Mujan.  Mujan, everyone.  Mujan, everyone.  Booze.  Booze.  World's universal language.  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  Whipple out.  What is it doing?  No beat a man. 
[01:16:00]  The brain is in their hands.  1-8-2-7-W-N-E.  We are having a lot of fun on this Whipple out Wednesday.  We have Gorilla Boy Jeff Norris giving out WoW Snickers today in Madsbeth, Queens.  I think we got him on the line.  Jeff Norris, what's up?  How we doing?  We got a packed house over here, man.  Right on.  You guys got to come down here.  The cow wants to say something.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The cow wants to say something. 
[01:16:30]  I love you guys.  I know.  Wow.  We heard one lady.  You hear that?  Yeah.  And I have a response for all the people that just said that.  What's that?  Here's our response.  Hey, what do you want me to tell you?  Get me a real phone.  No, it sounds great, man.  It sounds like a lot of people out there.  And I got to tell you, man.  Hope, this is the biggest crowd in all the sticker stuff I've done. 
[01:17:00]  Oh.  They got the hillbillies here with the cowboy hat, the racing cars.  They got WoW.  It's like a silicone party over here.  Right on.  Yeah, Madsbeth's been very kind to us with this WoW thing.  These guys at Mid-Island, I like to call it great.  They're giving out some drinks and stuff.  And it's a party over here.  The fine folks of Madsbeth.  Sounds like we got a party going on.  Yeah, come on down, man.  We're having a blast.  Trish is here showing the goods.  And we're having a bath.  Very good. 
[01:17:30]  Well, we're over here.  You're over there.  Boogaloo galoo.  Boogaloo galoo.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff Norris.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, fellas.  All right.  It's Mid-Island Electrical, Madsbeth, Queens, 5448th Street.  Giving out the WoW stickers today.  Yes.  As Whip-Em-Out Wednesday continues, Anthony.  Getting bigger and bigger as the weeks move on here.  Yes.  All right.  Let's get this lit.  Well, where's Rick?  Psycho Mark.  There's a chick called up.  He's a big fan of Psycho Mark. 
[01:18:00]  Does that mic work?  Yeah.  Why are you all the way in the corner?  You don't want to bring him over?  Because of Psycho Mark's behavior with the interns, dancers of privilege, and whatnot, we've had to tape him to a...  Easy.  Don't say that.  They're going to dump out a thing.  So he doesn't get his hands all over these poor girls that come in here.  So...  Oh, thank you for that.  Well, we had this lady call up about 20 minutes ago, Anthony.  She said she wants to meet Psycho Mark, which is a laugh riot, because this is the first time that has ever happened on this radio show. 
[01:18:30]  She's, what, 5'11", 1140 pounds, blonde hair, and says...  Small breasts, nice body shoes.  She's in town for a photo shoot.  Yeah.  And I asked if she was a model.  She said yes.  Rick says that she's got gorgeous long legs.  Model type.  Young?  Yeah.  I think late 20s.  Late 20s?  All right.  So the only way we would agree that one of our listeners would meet Psycho Mark is if he was tied to a chair, and you guys did a great job. 
[01:19:00]  He's duct taped to the chair at this moment.  Duct taped.  Great job, Arise.  What?  Yeah, let's blindfold him, and then we'll bring the girl in.  Dick.  We just had her on the phone about 15, 20 minutes ago.  All right.  They're putting the blindfold on, Anthony.  Psycho Mark getting to meet one of the things.  Oh, my God.  It looks like an execution.  It looks like you're going to execute him.  Yeah, get a picture of that.  Boss, I would like some of them taters and some calm bread. 
[01:19:30]  We're taking pictures for the unofficial ONA website.  Boundtreenew.com.  He hit his face on the mic.  You all right?  You idiot.  Make sure you put the sponge and wet it and put it on top of his head.  And don't put a dry sponge there.  Okay.  Don't go too close.  All right.  The mic is right in front of you.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho comes out.  Be careful, Bob.  No.  They said they've seen the girl. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Let's bring the girl in.  Let's see.  We will speak with the...  What's her name?  What's her name?  Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  Hello.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Wow.  You're tall.  Very nice.  And you want to meet that clown who's like duct tape to the chair to your right, huh?  I look great, don't I?  Hi.  How are you?  I think that's the sexiest laugh I've ever heard.  Really?  Really?  Lift up the mic a little bit.  It's a psychopathic laugh is what it is.  Really psycho.  Let me see the ass. 
[01:20:30]  I have a crush on him.  Go ahead.  All right.  Well, wait, wait, wait a minute.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  He wanted to see the ass.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  You can save that for Psycho Mark, right?  Yeah.  Look at Psycho Mark.  This isn't right.  Why?  Look at you.  You look better than...  It's not right.  It's better than you molesting these girls.  I would never do that.  Well, why don't you go over to Psycho Mark there. 
[01:21:00]  Flirt with him a little bit.  Go over there.  Yeah.  There she is.  I'll wait him.  Look at him.  He's like...  He's all blindfolded.  Oh, great.  Watch some junk land on my shoulder.  Why don't you take the blindfold off, Mark, and meet one of your fans?  She's taking the blindfold off.  Hi.  How are you doing?  How are you?  What's wrong?  I'm shaking your head.  I'm sitting in a chair.  I'm a big fan of yours right there.  Hi.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  I've got the hots for you. 
[01:21:30]  Can I have my hat back, please?  I've been listening for years, and I, too, have a crush on you.  Really?  Yes.  I think you have a really sexy laugh.  Ah.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  Psycho Mark, what do you think of Anna?  Very, very nice.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Very, very nice.  Show me that.  You want to see my butt?  Yeah, I'll see some butt.  Oh, my God.  Showing Psycho Mark the ass.  All right.  Very, very good.  You like that?  Yeah, yeah.  Sit down, Danny.  Sit down, Danny. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I've been doing shoots all this week.  Shoots?  I did a shoot for trying to get a nugget magazine.  Oh, really?  Yeah, trying to get the front cover of Nugget.  Nugget.  Nugget.  Yeah.  All right.  What is Nugget magazine?  It's one of those books that you find in the naughty store.  Oh.  Wow.  What do you think, Mark?  I've got a little forcible lap dance there.  So you've been naked before.  I hustle, not drink.  Huh?  Okay. 
[01:22:30]  You've been naked before, right?  Yes, sir.  So why don't you show Psycho Mark some stuff here?  You want to see some stuff, Psycho Mark?  Some stuff?  Sure.  Show me the stuff.  A little dance.  Sure.  Well.  Let her rip.  Yeah, let her rip.  I'm the submissive type, so you tell me what to do and I'll do it.  Oh, my God.  Park like a dog.  You're a rip.  This is great.  This is great.  Hey.  Hey.  Tell her to do something, man.  All right.  We'll remove that jacket. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Oh, it's chilly in here.  I think I'm getting the end.  What do you think so far, Psycho Mark?  She's got a tattoo on her shoulder.  Hot bod.  Hot.  Very nice.  Do you think she has a hot bod?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  What else?  Let's see.  I want to see Psycho Mark work his pimp hand.  Even though he can't move.  If you're just tuning in, Psycho Mark duct taped to a chair to meet one of his admirers.  And so far, he thinks she's very hot. 
[01:23:30]  Like the butt, like the rest of the body.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead, Psycho Mark.  All right.  Jump up on my chair and grind on my face.  Wow.  That's a little blunt.  Well, let's get going.  That's a little blunt.  Okay.  But one more thing.  What would you like me to grind on your face?  Uh-oh.  Let's start with the chest.  With the chest.  All right.  The chest.  My chest is all sweaty because it was really hot out in the car.  So that's just your little warning.  Since you're tied up there, you can't get away.  Wow.  And she has mounted Psycho Mark. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  She does like mine.  And she is like rubbing her boobies in Psycho Mark's face.  She's grinding the boobs.  Wait, give him a little more of that.  He kind of enjoyed that one.  All right.  And thank God he's duct taped because he can't grab the ass.  She just stuck her naked boobs in Mark's face and Mark's losing it.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Try the other cheek.  The other cheek?  Yeah.  He did.  He did.  He did. 
[01:24:30]  Oh.  Can't describe what's going on.  Well, she is pulling her shirt down and rubbing bare boob on Psycho Mark's cheek.  She has taken her gum out, Psycho Mark, and...  What's up to her face?  Meeting one of his admirers.  He's duct taped to a chair.  What else?  She's been in...  Okay.  What's next?  Oh, yeah.  Let's work that nice fine piece of it.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Work the fine piece of it.  What can you do with it?  Don't rub it on my face.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:25:00]  Very, very good.  Yeah.  She is now sitting on Psycho Mark's package.  There's no other way to say it, I guess.  Jumping up and down.  Psycho Mark can't use his hand because they're duct taped to a chair.  Psycho Mark is getting, like, ass-grinded on his junk.  I just got to be blunt about it.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's taped down.  Thank God, because his hands would be all over.  It looks like another night of privilege.  Your hands are so purple.  This is like privilege, I swear to God. 
[01:25:30]  He's groping.  He's, like, his arms are turning blue because he's trying to grab...  Look at him.  He's pushing himself in the chair.  He's torture.  He's torture.  He's torture.  He's torture.  Torture.  It's torture.  It's torture because he can't use his hands.  Are you pitching a tent?  No, you're pitching.  No, I'm tent.  Maybe he needs, uh...  I am not pitching a tent in front of all you.  I'm not looking...  We can't...  Well, why don't you feel the seat if he is?  He wants to...  No, I'm not pitching a tent. 
[01:26:00]  Feel the seat if he is.  It's at least a pop tent right now.  Oh, my God.  She was just checking him for a...  Don't take your pictures of my job.  She's just not...  Just grab this package.  Anna, is there anything going on down there?  Can we play what's in your pants?  Anna.  Oh.  Anna, is there anything going on down there?  I'll tell you right now, there's nothing going on there.  You must be a fag, then.  I am a fag, yes.  She's rubbing her body all over you.  What about...  Hmm. 
[01:26:30]  Play what's in, uh...  What's in her pants?  I think that would be great.  All right.  You want to play?  Yeah.  You want to play, right?  Um...  Well, just, uh...  Give me my personal rules here.  All right, here.  See my hands?  I'm going to stick it off.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You've got to walk into it.  All right, wait, how about...  All right, wait, wait, wait.  All right.  What are you doing?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  She looks like she's willing to do your rules.  Are you kidding? 
[01:27:00]  Put the blindfold back on.  How did he get this?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  We'll play a new version of what's in my pants.  Damn it.  She will put the blindfold on.  You reach your hand out.  You reach under.  Oh, my God.  And then what?  But he's got to be able to...  Oh, it's just going to be psycho Mark?  Playing?  Yeah, with his hand.  And then he has to tell us what it is.  You know, if he can guess what it is.  Are you cool for that?  I'm fine with that.  I'm totally fine with that.  All right.  Are you ready?  All right.  Psycho Mark is blindfolded. 
[01:27:30]  We're playing a live version of what's in my pants.  Psycho Mark's going to put his hand out.  And Anna's going to put her patch, I guess.  I guess we could say that.  All right.  Put your fingers out or something.  Put your hand out, Psycho Mark.  There's junk there.  I'm going to scream.  All right.  All right.  You ready?  Put your hand out.  I got your hand.  Well, that's it.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  I got to see this.  Come on.  All right.  All right.  His hand is out, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Anna has...  Casually walking.  Oh, my God.  She's giving Psycho Mark's fingers a little...  Let's just put it that way.  What do you think that was, Psycho Mark?  Sure.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  She's working Psycho Mark's fingers.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Why don't we play what's in my...  Yeah.  Play what's in my pants.  Yeah.  My fingers are all lubed up.  He's got lipstick all over his hand.  All right. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  She has just stepped over Psycho Mark's hand.  He's got his hand on her thigh, sort of.  Wait.  Take the skirt down.  I think he's a little shy now.  Yeah.  No.  The skirt's coming down.  Wearing a little body suit.  Hmm.  Oh.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What's wrong, baby?  What?  What?  What is it? 
[01:29:00]  What is it?  What is it?  Psycho Mark?  Triangle?  Wood floor?  Mohawk?  What?  What?  What?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Don't you want to play now, Mark?  What's the matter, Mark?  Mark, what's wrong?  What is it?  I'm playing, Mark.  What is it, Mark?  Wood floor?  What?  I'm not sure.  What do you guess?  No, I'm not going to guess.

[01:31:30]  Now, did I not take the joke good?  I didn't want any bathroom doors off.  It's torture!  It was so funny.  We had him blindfolded, and his hand was reaching around, trying to find Anna's, whatever name.  What's your real name?  My name is Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  He's trying to find my kiki.  He didn't find no kiki.  So now, are you going to get an operation?  Yeah, you are?  You're all gearing up for the operation?  Well, first, I'm getting my boobs.  You're getting boobs first?

Sorry for the distraction, but just...  Sounded pretty damn good.  Well, Psycho Mark, one of the regulars on our show that's a complete psychopath, we just tricked him.  We had this girl come in.  He thought he was meeting one of the fine listeners of the radio show.  We duct taped him to a chair.  And it turned out that the woman was actually a man.  And our own Psycho Mark just grabbed man junk. 
[01:37:00]  I heard the whole thing on the phone.  It sounded awesome.  Put his hand right under her skirt and grabbed a yam bag.  That's just good radio.  Yes, it is.  Jeff, I've got to say, I'm loving Survivor on CBS.  Right on.  Glad to hear it.  Second episode tonight on CBS, 8 o'clock, right?  Right.  8 o'clock, Channel 4 there.  Channel 2.  Channel 2 there.  Channel 2 in New York, yes.  So, so far, what, they kicked the old bag off?  Well, you know what?  That was a sympathetic vote. 
[01:37:30]  She, she was there for her own reasons, survived cancer, wanted to prove to herself and other  people, you know, that, that you could still do something.  I, that's probably who I would have voted for.  Yeah.  Well, she fell, she fell down during that little torch relay thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she just, you know, she wasn't as strong.  No.  Now, now, Jeff, you're the guy that hosts the show, right?  Right.  Okay, you do the, the tribal council on the island at the end?  That, that, and you, you dramatically, uh, uh, uh, unlit her torch at the end there when  they kicked her off the island?  That's part of the ritual. 
[01:38:00]  We're going to do it every single week.  Now.  We're going to snuff that flame.  Now, when do we get to see, uh, the survivors eating rats?  I've been reading about this, like, uh, for weeks now that the, some of the people in  the survivor series there were eating rats to survive.  It's coming up pretty quick.  They, in fact, they eat something, uh, tonight that is, uh, well, in Malaysia, it's a true  delicacy.  Is it worse than what Psycho Mark just had in his mouth?  Oh, no.  No.  If given the choice, I'd still rather eat what they ate. 
[01:38:30]  But, uh, it's a close second, I've got to tell you.  Okay.  Yeah, and they, they got to chow that down because that, too, is for the immunity challenge,  meaning if you lose, you go to tribal council.  So it's, it's like, it's the equivalent of sushi in, in America in terms of what the  Borneo people think of it.  But for Americans, it's pretty, it's pretty gnarly.  It's got to be nasty.  And they're going to be eating that tonight.  They'll be eating that tonight.  And that generation gap is still going on.  I mean, that still has a little bit more to play out.  Yeah, it seems to be the old against the young, huh?  Yeah, just for a while. 
[01:39:00]  Then it settles down.  I, I'm hearing there's a few, uh, gay people on the island we're going to find out about soon,  huh?  Oh, you hear about that?  I've been reading about Survivor.  I'm completely hooked after the first week.  Yeah, there's definitely not everybody on the island is straight.  Wow, second mark, when'd they kick you off?  Wouldn't that have been fun?  Now, now, Jeff, now, did you live on the island with the, with the Canadians for like two months  or whatever?  Yeah, I was out there with them.  Yeah, but, but you, you, you got makeup and your hair's blown dry and you got nice clothes 
[01:39:30]  and stuff.  No, same face shirts, same three pairs of shorts, no hair, no blow dryer, none of that  crap.  Well, uh, a short haircut, which made it easier, but.  Where were you living while everyone else was, you know, roughing it?  We were on the island just on a different part.  We built these little wooden, um, huts.  Yeah.  And we lived four to a, four people to a hut with a common shower.  And, um, we ate fish heads every night.  Mm, mm.  Yeah, I'm telling you, it, you know, everyone wants to think we had an easy ride of it, 
[01:40:00]  but, um, like in, I think it's Entertainment Weekly this week, it's a cover story.  The guy went to the island, he came and visited us, and he, he pretty much paints the true  picture.  It's, it's a jungle.  Yeah, yeah, a lot of people thought the production staff and everything had, uh, the life of Riley  there, but, uh, fact of the matter is there was really no way to get, uh, some of the comforts  of home even, even get it there.  That's exactly right.  And there were a hundred of us.  We had one phone, so getting on the line when it did work was virtually impossible anyway.  So it, really, you just kind of gave in and said, all right, I'm here for two months. 
[01:40:30]  Let's do it.  Any, uh, brushes with near death or anything from these people?  Well, the pirates, you know, we had, uh, they're, I'm, by the way, I'm taping Rock  and Roll Jeopardy today for VH1, and they're, they're waiting on me, so I gotta run.  No, you can make them fast, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be telling them to hold on.  But there were pirates circling, I mean, it's a major thoroughfare for pirates.  I ate, uh, arms and, and alcohol and tobacco from one country to another.  No, Psycho Mark, not butt pirates. 
[01:41:00]  No, no, no.  I'm down.  But the real deal, and we had armed guards surrounding our island to kind of keep us protected from,  from poachers and people who might want to come on.  And, uh, we definitely had a few run-ins.  Finally, our guy said, listen, that rock out there, that's the border.  You come past that, we kill you.  Wow.  Nice.  What else can we look forward to on tonight's episode?  Uh, they're gonna be eating some, uh, weird things.  Eating some weird things, the generation gap.  I think sexuality gets, uh, discussed a little bit tonight.  All right.  Sorry, I have to run, guys.  I'll call you back again.  That's cool, man.  Oh, Jeff, when this, uh, series starts really heating up, we would love to get you on the show again. 
[01:41:30]  Sounds great.  All right, man.  Right on.  There he goes, Jeff.  Bye.  The host of Survivor, CBS Tonight, 8 o'clock.  Survivor.  Also, he's the host of Rock and Roll Jeopardy on VH1.  Rock and Roll Jeopardy.  That guy, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I can't wait to watch that tonight, Anthony.  Cool.  Um, where's the, where's the, uh, where's the picture of Anna?  Someone, uh.  Actually, I put it in Mark's office for him.  Where's, uh.  Everyone's checking out Anna's Junk, because it's on that website.  What's the website again, Anna?  www.hotshannon.com. 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  And then you link on the Opie and Anthony, um, banner.  And you get to see what, uh, Second Mark had in his hand.  Really?  And he's texting me in my email address.  All right.  Can we, can we hear your real voice one more time before we go to break?  Well, what would you like me to say?  Uh, Sadie, Second Mark, I love you.  Second Mark, I love you.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Where's, where's the warning sign right in the head today?  He looks like the Gimp.  He looks like the Gimp trying to get out of the studio. 
[01:42:30]  Psycho Mark.  Look it up.  So that's, uh, those are your pictures right there?  Yes.  They're the ones that we're trying to get on Nuggets.  Actually, the ones that we have for, that we're sending in are better.  They're just, um, webcam shots.  Yeah.  We have the crumbs.  I see you're covering up, uh, your junk over there.  Yeah.  Cleverly have your hand there, poised, during that shot.  Yeah, that's it.  Covering the junk.  Hannah.  Hannah.  And there's your email.  Sure.  Hannah the Transsexual. 
[01:43:00]  Rob from JFK.  Make sure Ball Boy, sorry, uh, Psycho Mark washes off the man meat junk from his hands before  touching anything in the studio.  Two words for Psycho Mark.  Butt sex.  And you don't even need to take me to the prom.  I'm a cheap dick.  Butt sex.  Penises.  Oh, great.  Pussah!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:43:30]  So when are you having your operation?  Hannah, when are you having your operation?  Um, well, uh, depends on how many sugar daddies I find before then.  You need someone to sponsor it?  No, I'm just kidding.  No, uh, I'm saving my money now.  I mean, I'm not as pressed about it because...  How much does that run?  Well, if you go to Thailand, I guess it'll be about like 7,000.  Thailand?  If I do it in the U.S., it'll be 14,000.  Well, you get what you pay for.  What do you want to go?  They do it with chopsticks over there, don't they?  They kind of pull it away like a piece of rice. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, you know what?  Slice and dice?  I don't know.  I'd be a little leery.  Well, I'd be a little leery about having it, uh, even thinking about having that done.  My God.  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  You must hate your penis, don't you?  Yeah, guys.  You do?  Wow.  Hey, Matt.  Hates your penis.  What's up?  No, what's up?  Hey, guys.  All I got to say is, man, I haven't been listening to you that long.  A couple of my friends turned me on to you guys.  I'll tell you right now.  That was the best joke I have heard you guys pull the entire time I have been listening 
[01:44:30]  and Psycho Mark, a very good sport about it.  Almost, almost too good a sport.  Almost too good.  Hey, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, syndication  when Psycho Mark gets the taste out of his mouth.  I should have heard what he whispered in my ear.  In your ear?  Yeah.  What did he say?  I'm not telling.  Oh.  Were you whispering in her ear?  He did.  He did.  That's another show.  Psycho Mark has this habit of dry-humping girls.  Yeah.  That walk around the street. 
[01:45:00]  Could you just dry-hump them one last time before we take a break?  No!  Yeah.  It looks like the gimp.  Hold them in play.  Go ahead.  Hold them in play.  Hold them in play.  It looks like the gimp.  This is how the poor ladies feel around the office when you're dry-humping them.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Joy chair.  It's joy chair.  I'm jealous.  You can give me some competition on those nipples there. 
[01:45:30]  It's joy chair.  It's joy chair.  It's joy chair.  Oh, my God. 
[01:46:00]  Well, that's pretty funny.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  I think he has a case of cabin fever.  You think?  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, my God.  That was him.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Penis.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Do you use your tongue prettier than a $20 hole? 
[01:47:00]  Ouch.  All right.  Excuse me while...  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Okay, brother.  Oh!  Very good.  Oh, he's sticking in my mouth.  Yeah, that's what I think.  All right.  Very good, Mark.  Good job.  So get him out, Mark.  Psycho Mark, what a sport. 
[01:47:30]  Yippee.  That was good fun.  You know, I can actually take a joke unlike other people on the show.  Nice try, joke boy.  Yeah, at least I didn't rip the bathroom door off the wall and smash things.  You didn't recognize, Anna, without the makeup and the nice hair and everything, it's our own Mark Parenteau.  The old jock from Q104, remember?  It's the rear admiral. 
[01:48:00]  All right, we've got to take a break.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey, put your hand up my skirt, Mark.  Hey.  Is that your junkie?  You just happened to see me.  Here's another classic hit.  Jesus.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Well, we've got to thank Anna for coming in.  Anna, thank you very much.  There's a lot of people checking in on the website saying they went and saw your picture on the website and said they wouldn't have been able to figure it out either.  Right on.  Well.  Wait, we need her to tape a couple things.  If we hit record, will it work?  All right.  Just hit record.  Or just get on that. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Anna, repeat after me.  In both voices.  All right.  Look what I did to you again.  Look what I did to you again.  And now as a guy.  Look what I did to you again.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  Hey, let me do that one again.  All right.  Go ahead.  Look what I did to you again. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Just a deeper voice than me.  I can sing like a girl and a guy, actually.  Oh, yeah?  I'll trade my voice to that.  I bet show tunes, right?  I can do whatever.  I'm guessing Liza Minnelli.  Judy Garland.  No?  Judy Garland.  Yeah, Mara.  Why do you sing it like this name?  I can't remember.  Bats.  Bats.  Negative.  Yeah, I can do it.  Type on negative, really?  I can do a Peter Steele impression.  Really?  Let's hear that.  Can you do that?  I've been looking for trouble.  And boy, I found her. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Hey, that junk was just in your face, Michael Mark.  Wow.  Junk from Paul?  No, I can't tease the Aqualons.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  And we'll be back.  Gentlemen, start your wanky.  What about wanky?  Are you masking me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, it just makes me tangle. 
[01:50:00]  All right, and lots of instant feedback coming in.  Big Cav, our Big Cav, to Psycho Mark.  At least I don't smell like man junk.  Steve C. from FoundryMusic.com, though, and an unofficial website.  Please, please, please tell me you've got pictures of this.  Yes.  Oh, and we have pictures.  Plenty of pictures.  They're coming your way soon, Steve.  Two words for Psycho Mark.  But sex.  All right, we've read most of these.  Okay, Anthony, Metro Cable pay-per-view.  Yes.  End of Days is on pay-per-view this month.  End of Days is wonderful.  Terrific movie.  It's fantastic.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  End of Days.  What, you want to see it?  Arnold's movie?  End of Days.  Presented to filmmakers and the unique opportunity to instill genuine fear of the unknown into masses.  What?  What?  I understood him.  Yeah.  Well, see, End of Days.  Yeah, it's on pay-per-view.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Pollack, and this whole thing, good and evil, you know?  What?  What, what, what? 
[01:51:00]  No, it's not the Invisible Man distracting me.  No, no, not today.  What, Andy?  I'll be back.  She can do Arnold Schwarzenegger, too.  Wonderful.  Arnold.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I...  It's not a tumor.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Yeah, it's not a tumor, right?  That's the real deal.  Hey, I'm the best thing to happen to this world since the 7-Eleven Slurpee, and I brought  my own straw.  Is that your little tagline?  Yeah.  That's, that's...  You could do it like the movie guy. 
[01:51:30]  End of Days.  The story takes the audience on a whirlwind ride from the Vatican City to New York's  sordid Times Square, where Psycho Mark can be seen touching men.  No, of course, that's not an End of Days.  It's a good versus evil thing, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Come on, you know, it's got a lot of explosions in it.  Death, destruction.  End of Days on Pay-Per-View. 
[01:52:00]  Order, End of Days today on Time Warner Home Theater, Comcast In Demand, and CableVision  Pay-Per-View.  Movies made to order.  It's End of Days.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Everyone just in shock around here.  After the last 45 minutes of radio.  Yeah, it was fun.  That was, that was a lot of fun.  Very fun.  It was great.  We gotta go to the phones real fast.  Go to Mark. 
[01:52:30]  Mark, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mark.  I guess that gay hand really works.  Doesn't Psycho Mark have the gay hand, too?  Gay pimp hand.  Yeah, the gay pimp hand.  Now he's touching other guys' manship.  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  You're giving all the guys with the name Mark a bad name there, Psycho Mark.  Don't worry, Mark.  All our listeners have short-term memory.  They're not going to remember this at the next Roadshow or anything.  This will be gone.  This will be gone.  Just like, just like no one calls me Precious anymore. 
[01:53:00]  You know, it goes away in time.  Georgia!  Thanks, Georgia!  It goes away in time.  Don't worry about it.  I don't think there'll be one sign at the next Roadshow.  Hey, I want to come to the next Roadshow.  Yeah.  Yes.  Hey, come to the next Roadshow.  I'll be there.  We'll do a recreation.  That would be C-O-M-E, by the way.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This amazes me.  How did he fall for that?  I mean...  No, in all fairness, we set it up pretty good because we had him tied to the chair and we 
[01:53:30]  had a blindfold on.  Yeah, but you gave him so many clues.  It's like, first you heard the voice and I was like, oh my God.  And then 150 pounds?  My girlfriend is, she's 5'11".  She's nowhere near 150 pounds.  That's 150 pounds of mail.  She's got like 10 pounds of junk.  Yeah, I was thinking 50 pounds of sack and everything, you know?  And I hope he knows that you guys are going to use this against him for like a while.  You can't even know on our show.  We'll play the bit 10 times in the next week. 
[01:54:00]  And he deserves it.  I think he deserves it.  So, I don't know.  Remember, Mark, no means yes now.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you.  Actually, I think he wanted, like, I think he knew it from the beginning and kind of just  wanted to experience the sack.  No, I don't think he did.  I think he did.  I mean, I just, I knew that from the, from the point you started doing that, I was like,  they're so going to bust him on this.  And he falls for this.  I knew there was something.  There had to be something.  There was a twist. 
[01:54:30]  It was too good to be true.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he fell for it.  Yeah, he definitely fell for it.  A new promotional thing, Mark, is a fact.  Say what you want, but you had no clue.  I had a clue.  No, I'm going to Mark.  You're checking me out.  Everyone knows Fox.  See?  So, it's, it's, I'm used to this.  I don't think he knew.  No.  It's, it's what I do for a living.  I knew, all right.  Well, yeah, you did.  I found out the hard way.  You did find out the hard way.  Anthony, thanks for spitting all over my legs while you talk.  Jim, what's going on? 
[01:55:00]  Anthony, don't confuse me.  That was the best radio I've ever heard in a long time.  That was hilarious.  And, Mark, I guess, I don't know if you're a full-fledged fig or half-fig, but what I  got to ask is, what are you guys going to do to spaz now?  I mean, after he racked up the van, I remember a while back you had him in the bathroom with  some woman and her vag, I mean, him screamed, hi, Evan.  Yeah, we've had, we have some classic screams on the show.  Yeah, I feel sorry for spaz, I feel sorry for Rick, and ONA, believe it or not, you guys 
[01:55:30]  should watch your own back, because you guys are going to try to out-prank each other.  No, we got burned already.  I don't know.  I got a feeling one of these days you guys are going to try it.  I can't wait to hear it.  One will turn on the other?  Nah.  Just for a prank.  Nothing that's so serious.  Ain't going to be me.  All right, Jim.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  By the way, you guys promised me that Mark would wax me.  Oh, really?  Oh.  What needs waxing?  What would you think? 
[01:56:00]  I don't even want to know, man.  A lip?  A lip.  Which one?  I see where you guys are now.  Rob from Queens.  Mark enjoyed touching man junk more than old dirty enjoyed his Hummer.  Andrew.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Listen, first off, I think that Evan Psycho got what he deserved, and I could see him in  the shower just like in the crying game, in the shower for hours each day.  We're going to be like Glenn Close from Big Chill.  Big Chill in the shower crying. 
[01:56:30]  Psycho Gay Marco.  George here!  Hey!  George here!  Hey!  George here!  Hey!  Mark's going to go see End of Gays.  It's coming in.  All right.  That was fun.  Very good.  Yeah.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to ask how Psycho Mark likes playing for the other team.  Big freaking homo.  What kind of faggot are you?  You know, payback.  Oh, my God. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, hey, Mark.  Payback comes around like a bitch, and you just got nailed by a bitch.  Hey, he should have thrown.  Don't worry, Mark.  They only abuse you for a day or two, and then they forget about it.  It's okay.  What did I do to deserve this?  Not for nothing.  Paul from Lawrence.  Opie, you can't figure out why Mark didn't figure it out.  If you are gay, Opie, you know.  Pimp head.  Come here, Mark.  Uh-oh, we have some redemption.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:57:30]  What's up, Mark?  Now Mark has his face between real, live, naked boobs.  Huh?  Shannon's big boobs.  Shannon's big boobs.  What's her website again?  Hotshannon.com.  Hotshannon.com.  Is there a puppy between my legs?  There's no bump between her legs, like Mark.  But you know what?  It's too late.  Too late.  If we can bring in ten girls that look like Shannon, they're going to just remember the  one male that was on top of you today.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, it will.  Yeah, I guess.  Let's see.  Mark, after that, I'd have to jump in a 55-gallon drum and roll myself off a cliff.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Mark's gay.  Terrific.  Matt from the city.  I guess Mark likes to receive junk mail.  Oh, jeez.  That's good.  Vinny from Rosdale.  Rosdale, hey, Psycho Mark, what was in her pants?  A cocktail, frank, footlong, or a kielbasa? 
[01:58:30]  Excuse me.  Poor baby.  Man, I thought he was straight after seeing him in the foam pit at the road show with all  that T&A in his face, but now, man, he's an effing flamer.  Jeez, man.  The Gay Pride Parade Committee checking in.  Is Mark available for grand marshalling next year?  Can you put your junk in a jar after it gets removed and bring it back in here? 
[01:59:00]  I'm hoping to do that for you guys, actually.  Kid.  Well, they turn it inside out.  I'm selling my shoes and stockings.  Why not those?  Really?  You probably have some testes if you really want them.  Chico.  Hey, Chico, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Yo, I learned that Psycho Mark can finally open a mitt that he doesn't just like his apartment  for the view. 
[01:59:30]  Syndication when it's out of litigation.  All right, thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Let's go to Jeff.  Hey, Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I got to tell you, man.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  As soon as I heard that thing's voice, I was like, oh, my God, it's got to be a guy.  There's junk all over that place.  And I think that's like...  People are so accepting.  Well, a lot of people, that's why we had to hide the instant feedback in the phone screen  because a lot of people were definitely in on the joke. 
[02:00:00]  They knew right away.  Yeah, I called and Spaz got me on and I said, you got to tell them to do what's in my pants.  I think it's a guy and he just hung up on me.  All right.  Well, we were trying to hang up on all you guys because we didn't want Mark to see the  screen.  Yeah.  But you know what?  If I was Mark and I was taped in that chair and I heard that person's voice, I would have  just threw the chair over and gave myself a concussion.  Get me out of there.  A concussion.  He looked like King Gimp for a little while there.  He was trying to get out.  All right, Jeff.  It's a indication when Mark comes out of the closet.  I'm out today. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, John.  Yeah, how's it going?  We're doing all right.  Hey, Mark, you there?  Mark there?  Yeah, he's here.  Yes, I'm here.  I'm disappointed with you.  Did he think that was really a woman?  Yes.  What's the matter with you?  You freaking faggot.  As soon as the blindfold came off, then it was like effing toy.  Oh, you couldn't tell from the voice?  Come on, maybe you're making it with your roommate over there and you're getting a little  used to it there.  Mark, you're burying yourself. 
[02:01:00]  Now you're saying when you took off the blindfold, you knew?  No, because at that point you still had like man chest in your face, man groin rubbing  your groin.  Yeah, I liked it.  I liked it.  I'll just bury myself right now.  I loved it.  It was a great time.  Let's do it again.  Iggy, gigg, gigg.  He sure knows how to diffuse the situation.  Don't worry, Mark.  This will go away in a couple of days.  People will forget.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  They will.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Homo Mark. 
[02:01:30]  Jay from Jersey.  Syndication when Mark turns straight.  All right.  Well, we got to move on, I guess.  Can I get caught out of this godforsaken chair so I can burn my body?  Uh, Brad, what's going on?  Uh, yeah, listen.  She, uh, posed for which magazine?  Nuggets?  Nuggets, she said.  That should have clued him off right there.  Nuggets is the same thing as Yann bags.  Is it really?  No, actually, it's just a fetish, um, magazine.  Fetish magazine. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's kind of like...  Fetish for hemaphrodites?  No, it's not.  Not a fetish.  No?  Well, it sure sounds like it.  I don't know.  Nuggets?  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  It's kind of like leg scene and stuff like that.  All right.  Thank you, Brad.  Uh, let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, what's up?  Uh, nothing, Opie.  How you doing?  That old gag.  Anthony.  Talk about the first thing that pops up, huh?  Anthony!  What's up, Bowen A?  Hit it.  I wanted to see if when he's on the radio, Chick, or he's on the morning show, or he's  that...  It's in the case you're never, guys.  See you later.  You curse. 
[02:02:30]  Thank you.  Yeah, he's got to watch the language.  Yeah.  That was a funny line, but, uh, when you take eight seconds out of it, it doesn't make  sense, so...  Uh, Ron and Fez, check in, and Psycho Mark, you'll always be welcome on our show.  Fabulous!  All right, we gotta, we gotta move on to other things.  Yes.  Anna, the website again.  It is at www.hotshammon.com, and you click on the Opie and Anthony banner.  And you'll see what, uh, Psycho Mark was grabbing.  Yeah, and you'll see my pictures and my email address if you want to send me any, like, email. 
[02:03:00]  Right.  Do you want to remind them again real quick?  What?  What?  All right, we gotta, we gotta move on.  Yeah.  Thank you, uh, ladies, I guess.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  So you're...  Wonderful job.  Could you say you're very welcome in your man voice?  What, do you like that?  No, it's just...  That's got me in enough trouble today.  It's just...  I got it.  Oh, wait, we just dumped out all of it.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:03:30]  And a double-dump.  We double-dumped.  Psycho Mark's now cursing.  All right, get him out of there.  That was really funny.  Another thing that didn't make the air.  Jeez, get me in trouble.  I better stop.  What do you want me to do?  You should be a ditty.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  It's going to be fun.  Boop is gigantic.  That's against the law.  It should be.  Opie and Anthony.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  I just love being naked.  Oh, yeah.  And E-W...  Wow!  Um, Anthony, so be beverages, the leader in healthy refreshment. 
[02:04:00]  Yes, good drinking one.  Yeah, I don't know what flavor we're plugging today, but I'm enjoying Liz Blizz right now.  With echinacea, zinc, and vitamin C, giving me a fine boost of energy right now, late in the show.  Psycho Mark likes the one with banana juice in it.  No, you know, real fruit juice.  Instead of Liz Blizz, it's a word that rhymes with Liz.  Yeah, so be beverages, great.  Provides supplemental herbs designed to energize the body, uplift the spirit, and enlighten the mind. 
[02:04:30]  Wednesday's flavor, 3G Teas.  3G Teas, a line of exotic teas whose natural health benefits have been enhanced by the addition of Sobe's exclusive 3G package, Opie.  Ginseng.  Huh!  Ginseng!  For long-lasting endurance.  Mmm.  Ginkgo, to sharpen the mind.  And Ginkgo, to sharpen the mind.  Oh, did I just say that?  Wow, you're sharp, Anthony. 
[02:05:00]  Guarana.  Love the comic wit.  Yeah.  The comic stylings of Anthony today.  And Ginkgo.  Guarana.  Guarana.  Which provides an immediate energy boost.  Flavors include Sobe black tea, Sobe green tea with echinacea, and oolong tea.  Very good.  With bee pollen.  Bee pollen, Opie.  It's great stuff.  Tastes great.  And, yes, it does enlighten the spirit and the mind.  You've got to love it.  Well, Anthony, be on the lookout for the Sobe Lizard Love Bus, spreading the Sobe experience all over the tri-state area. 
[02:05:30]  And grab a Sobe and drain the lizards.  Sobe beverages.  Matter of fact, Sobe beverages gave us something cool to give away here, Ant.  Not for nothing.  When it receives a skateboard provided by Sobe beverages, these skateboards are very, very cool.  If you want one, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One bad door.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:06:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  1027-WNEW.  Yes, Anthony, it's Whip them out Wednesday.  Of course.  We haven't spent much time on Whip them out Wednesday today.  It's been a very busy show thus far.  No, no.  Very easy concept.  People wow on your car.  And ladies, if they feel like it, we'll wow you on the way home.  Yeah, it's easy.  We want everyone to be very safe with their wowing experience.  And don't harass the ladies.  We would greatly appreciate that.  Be cool.  All right? 
[02:06:30]  Also, Larry from Plainview reminding us that Britney Spears is going to be on Fox tonight.  Get your Vaseline now because it'll probably run out like batteries before a hurricane at the store.  All the Vaseline is going to be gone from all the pharmacies.  Pick it up.  Britney.  I also have a challenge to the O&A fans.  Oh, yeah?  We love attacking websites.  Yeah, that's always fun.  Mark from Jersey, thank you for the suggestion.  I don't know if you guys care or not, but Britney Spears has an online chat tonight on Fox.com. 
[02:07:00]  Tonight at 10 o'clock.  Tonight, 10 o'clock, Britney online chat.  How cool would it be if we got some O&A questions to the lovely Britney Spears?  How funny would it be to tune in or log on to that and see screen names such as Yam Bag asking Britney if she likes it in the balloon knot?  Well, a lot of those, come on.  A lot of those web chats are a waste of time.  You never get your question on.  You know, there's millions of people checking in. 
[02:07:30]  They take 10 questions and they get out of there.  It's just fun.  I don't know.  If we got thousands of our listeners pounding it, the odds are much better.  So we'll see what happens with that, Anthony.  Yam Bag.  Did they finally bury Tito Puente?  I hope so.  Holy Jesus, they've been parading this guy around.  Was there anything left of the body?  Poor guy.  He put him in the ground?  How long has he been dead?  He's been dead a while now.  They were parading his body all over Manhattan yesterday. 
[02:08:00]  He saw something like he coughed in.  Let's see.  Yeah, he's here.  What, yesterday?  Yeah.  They put him in the ground finally?  They finally buried him, yeah.  Finally.  They paraded him around the streets of New York.  What the hell is that all about?  It was weird.  I don't know.  The casket was on tour yesterday.  I guess it's very big.  It's very big in the Hispanic community.  And they finally got him uptown and buried him. 
[02:08:30]  It's just a little strange.  I've never seen that before.  No.  But a lot of people saying it should be a day of celebration.  So I was celebrating.  Were you?  I like it.  Mark, I'm just glad he's in the ground finally.  City smells enough.  Sorry, that was an easy one.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, okay, terrific, guys.  I just got wowed on 287 Northbound in Jersey.  Nice.  You can just tell, Tito.  Congratulations.  Congratulations. 
[02:09:00]  I mean, I can't even keep the sticker on all the time because the old lady gives me a hard time.  So I put it on a magnet.  Yeah, a lot of you married men out there are suggesting that we come out with the Velcro wow stickers.  I just throw it on a magnet, man.  Yeah, you just got to step up and say, look, it doesn't mean I'm getting wowed, honey.  I'm just supporting the O&A show.  Yeah, well, I told them, but don't cut it, you know?  Yeah, they're too smart for us.  Well, that's a pretty good idea he's got.  You get some of that magnetic backing stuff and just put the sticker on that and you can slap it on your vehicle. 
[02:09:30]  I made a mess of them for the guys I work with.  They love it.  Oh, cool, man.  Well, congratulations.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  We haven't heard from many ladies today, Anthony.  Teresa.  Yeah?  Turn down your radio.  All right.  Oh, my goodness.  Teresa?  Yeah?  Turn off your radio.  It's off.  Who is that talking in the background?  I'm right outside, the O&A sticker site.  Oh, you're at the wow sticker stop. 
[02:10:00]  Mid-Island Electrical, 5448th Street.  Exactly.  Everybody's leaving.  That's Beth, Queens.  I just decided to wow and they took two pictures.  How many people are around right now?  Around 30 people here right now, but everybody's leaving.  Why don't you quickly flash your fun bags?  What?  Flash your boobs on the show.  Let's go.  All right.  Fine.  All right.  I want to hear the reaction.  But nobody's looking.  Well, scream and tell them to look.  All right.  Everybody look!  Have an ugly set or something. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  She's lost.  Teresa?  Yeah?  Hello?  Yeah, I'm right here.  All right.  We don't want to use up the rest of your oxygen, so we're going to leave, right?  Yes, she's going to go here.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I cannot talk to her.  Oh, my God.  What?  Please, if you're going to call the program, pay attention.  Yes.  Johnny! 
[02:11:00]  Yo!  How are you, Johnny?  Great, man.  L-I-E, exit 52, got wowed.  There you go.  It's happening all over the place today.  Absolutely.  Brave-o.  Congratulations.  You guys are the best.  It's a syndication when Circle Mark comes out of the closet.  All right.  A lot of people saying that today.  Thank you.  Later.  Just people getting wowed all over the place.  We could do this for four straight hours.  Eric.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I love you guys.  I just got wowed on the Bronx River Parkway.  Yeah.  And I swear, I don't know if you guys have ever been on there, but it's pretty narrow. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I almost ran off the road.  Well.  Like the guardrail.  Well, we don't want you to, you know, hurt yourself.  Yeah, but hey, it was well worth it, man.  All right.  If I die, then, you know, I die happy.  All right.  Congratulations.  Okay, man.  It's a syndication when Mark stops smoking pot.  Ernie from the Bronx.  It's a syndication when Brittany answers my butt sex question tonight at 10.  Yeah.  Fox.com.  A live chat with Brittany Spears and see if we can get an O&A presence on that thing  today.  Jay, what's going on?  Nothing.  I'm on the parkway and just got wowed. 
[02:12:00]  Sounds like you're in your house.  What?  Sounds like you're in your house.  It's a rock, okay?  A little faggot.  Was that supposed to get me today?  What?  Was that supposed to get me?  Yeah, man.  You're sticking up for the rock?  I don't think I was sticking up for the rock.  Do you want the rock to violate your balloon?  Do you, Mark?  Well, I don't want anyone to violate my balloon.  I'm going to say you're a little faggot.  Do you like, you like, I love the rock.  Don't insult the rock.  Do you like a muscle man, Jay? 
[02:12:30]  You got posters of the rock in your bedroom that you spank it to at night?  Yeah, that's what I do.  Is that what you do?  Yeah, that's what I do.  Look what you're talking.  You're critiquing men's bodies and sticking up for the rock.  Hey, Jay.  That's great.  You want to talk.  That's great.  Hey, Jay.  Jay, why don't you come down to the station?  I'll show you what my man boobs can do.  The rock has a nice body, Opie.  Noah?  You're arguing because we...  The rock. 
[02:13:00]  See, Opie?  The rock has a nice, slender body that I would love pressed against me.  No, it's not that.  I don't think...  And, Jay, if you know anything about this show, we've made up with the rock.  You're the biggest hypocrite, though.  All right, why don't you come down here?  I'll show you what a hypocrite can do.  No, you're such a hypocrite.  Come on down.  Come on down, you pussy.  Come on down.  I will come down.  Pussy, pussy, no, you won't.  I won't.  You're 15 and you swank at the rock in your room.  Tell big kids to talk your salads, right, you faggot.  What the fuck? 
[02:13:30]  I will come down.  I'll see you.  I'll see you.  I never understand guys that can teach other guys.  Jay, when I was your age, I was collecting Playboy magazines, not wrestling magazines.  The rock.  You were collecting Playboy magazines because you couldn't get some.  Because you liked girls.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's all you liked.  Yeah, you got me, Jay.  Yeah, yeah.  You can actually get a girl.  Yeah, I'm the only one that was collecting Playboy magazines at your age.  Yeah, Jay.  Yeah, yeah.  You eat your potato, Jay.  Jay, you're a faggot. 
[02:14:00]  You're a faggot.  What a faggot.  Jay, you're such a faggot.  How's your wife, bro?  Gone, dude.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Was that supposed to hurt too, Jay?  Ouch.  What?  Was that supposed to hurt or something?  What?  No, man, no.  And stop looking at my man boobs in a raw magazine, you faggot.  No, I would just fucking...  When I look through a magazine, I don't look at guy's chest and go, ooh, that guy has man boobs.  I'm going to call up and critique his body. 
[02:14:30]  No, man.  What a...  You like...  Dude, you sound like such a little faggot.  Yo, listen, listen.  Go back to the house that your wife took, all right?  Yeah, go sleep there.  I didn't have a house.  I rented, dude.  Get your facts straight if you're going to try to trash us.  What?  Well, Jay, this was great.  You did a great job.  You really got to us.  So, congratulations.  I can't believe I got...  Now, go open up your centerfold of the rock and start spanking away, Jay.  Oh, rock.  Rock.  What are you doing? 
[02:15:00]  I wish the rock would say, the rock has finally come back to my penis.  Yeah, that's right.  That's what I want to hear the rock say.  That's exactly what you say.  I wish the rock was behind me.  No, no, no.  Dude, you sound so stupid, Jay, talking about the rock.  Precious.  Whatever, man.  People say precious all the time.  Jay.  Jay.  Yo, precious.  Jay.  Jay.  One second.  Hold on.  Let me say one thing.  Let me say one thing.  Let me say one thing, bro.  Yeah, go ahead, bro. 
[02:15:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Can I say it?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  See, you guys have a really good show.  I really like you.  Dude, I don't really care if you like our show.  Go back to spanking it to the rock.  Dude, you're not going to let me go.  How much more time are you allowed on the phone before mommy comes and tells you you've  been on too long?  Yeah.  Finish your homework.  Finish your homework.  Bye, Jay.  I've got to go.  My mommy's here.  Jay, Jay, Jay, I'm here every day, two to seven.  Come on down and I'll show you what my bandwidth can do.  Bye, bye.  Oh, the wrong.  Oh.  Oh, I could just imagine me and the rock. 
[02:16:00]  Let me think about it.  Oh.  It's the rock.  He's coming over to my house.  What a loser.  We obviously had our problems with the rock, but we, like, that's so old.  Opie.  And we, like, you know, settled our differences.  I have problems with your body, Opie.  But the rock.  I don't get it. 
[02:16:30]  I don't get other guys that start, like, look at guys' bodies and then want to call them  up and critique their bodies and defend a big mook like the rock.  And the funny thing about the whole damn thing is we were in the latest issue of Raw magazine.  I was the one who pointed out that I had man boobs in this picture for some reason.  No one brought it to our attention.  I was the one who said, wow, look at this picture. 
[02:17:00]  I got man boobs.  So now he's calling to try to get to me by saying I had man boobs.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Unbelievable.  I was just thumbing through my issue of Raw magazine with one hand looking for the rock pictures.  It's just messed up, man, because, like, at the road show, people were critiquing, like,  my hair, critiquing.  My legs.  I was wearing shorts.  Anthony, you got chicken legs. 
[02:17:30]  Dude, there were five naked women at any given time on that stage, and he felt compelled  to comment on my shorts and Opie's sandals.  It's like, what?  What?  Anthony, I think Jay wants the rock bottom.  Yeah.  Oh, if he could only joke slam me.  No, he wants the rock's bottom.  I would love for him to give me the people's penis, a new move by the rock.  Oh, the people's penis. 
[02:18:00]  I would love the people's penis.  Lube it up.  Prison lube, Rock.  Yeah.  I would love to smell what the rock is cooking in his crotch.  Rock, please.  I can't wait.  I got tickets.  I got tickets for the garden next time they come, and I'm going to be ringside.  I hope to be there at the corner that the rock hops up on and gives the crowd his pompous 
[02:18:30]  look so I could look at the rock's man meat.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Ed.  Let's take a break.  That's great.  The people's fist.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Huh?  What?  We're not finishing the argument with a 15-year-old kid. 
[02:19:00]  Dude, we already...  I got it.  Dude.  He's cursing.  Yeah, he's gone.  I'm in arguments with a 15-year-old.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right, Ed.  We'll be back.  Boobs, the world's universal language.  Kofi and Anthony, your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  N-E-W.

[02:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  www.foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  Music.com  Foundry Music.com  Bringing out the pictures of Psycho Mark and the training.  Let's go to the phones.  Melissa, what's going on?  Oh, this guy's cutting off.  He's getting onto Parkway South.  I followed him, but forget it.  What happened?  You were following him?  He's getting onto the Parkway.  Because I was following him, he must think I'm some kind of a psycho.  I didn't have to take the Parkway, though, so forget it. 
[02:21:30]  Guy almost got wowed.  Wow.  You were following him?  Can you say his license plate number over there?  Uh, no.  I think he's in a white Saturn, right?  Yeah, of course, yeah.  Oh.  That's all you have to say.  He's got on Parkway South.  Oh, and you want to wow him?  He almost got wowed.  Tell him that we need eye contact.  He looked at me.  He's getting off.  I just got a wow on him.  I might have.  I don't know.  Now, did he have a wow sticker or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, he had on.  Well, it was like with the black tape.  Oh, we like those.  We know you're in the house.  They're really big across the back of his car. 
[02:22:00]  Love the homemade wows.  And you were following him for a while on 46 East?  Uh, yeah.  No, I'm on 3 East now.  I followed him on a 3 East, but he got off onto the Parkway.  Oh, he lost his big chance.  I hit him down the shore, so who knows?  Oh, well.  Oh, well, maybe next time.  And you were going to do it live on the air for us, huh?  Oh, my God.  I would have pissed in my pants, but yeah, probably.  That's cool.  Well, thanks for helping us out, though.  Okay, no problem.  So close.  I guess I can't get on the air anyway. 
[02:22:30]  I just want to tell Opie that he's got, like, the hottest voice in the world.  Oh, well.  Well, no, no.  You're talking to Opie.  Can't get on the air.  Okay.  Oh, no.  No, no.  You're talking to Opie.  You're on the air, you nut.  No, you're right.  She hung up because she said she wasn't on the air, Ed.  You ass.  She wanted you.  I was ready to do my Barry White.  You could have scored.  All right, stop laughing, you ass.  Let's go to Leslie. 
[02:23:00]  It's so funny when a girl says you have a hot voice on the radio, then all of a sudden you  just start working it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know I did.  Thank you.  Hey, Leslie, what's up?  Hey.  How are you?  I see you guys every afternoon.  You guys crack me up.  Oh, good.  Did you hear that Psycho Mark crap about an hour ago?  Yeah, oh, my God.  I was laughing before my supervisor sits in front of me at work, and I listen to you guys  on the radio, but I try to keep the radio down real low, and I'm cracking up, and I'm  like, oh, my God, I'm going to get fired.  Yeah, we're definitely going to replay that tomorrow because a lot of people missed out 
[02:23:30]  on that because they were early in the show.  That was pretty twisted.  Oh, you guys were great.  I love you.  Cool.  Listen, I'm on the Parkway South just now, but I got off my exit.  I just got wowed.  You got wowed?  Yes, and the cool thing is that I have a gay pride sticker on the back of my car, and  these girls, I don't know whether they were gay or not, but they came by and they wowed  me.  So you got a wow sticker on your car, too?  Yeah, I got the wow sticker and my gay pride sticker on the back, my rainbow sticker, and  they came by and they wowed me.  So you're...  I just got my sticker last week, so I'm like real excited. 
[02:24:00]  All right, so you're obviously gay?  I'm bisexual.  Bisexual?  Ah.  Yeah.  And you got really excited when you finally got the...  What is it?  The wow sticker.  No, the rainbow sticker or whatever?  Well, no, I've always had the rainbow sticker on my car.  What's the other sticker, then?  I've seen the rainbow.  Yeah, the wow sticker.  Oh, all right.  I got both of them on my car.  All right, I got you now.  Okay.  I thought you were excited because you got the rainbow sticker.  No, I'm excited because I got the wow sticker.  Okay, gotcha.  Recently, and all of a sudden I just got wowed.  See, there's ladies out there that want to get wowed as well. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God, it was beautiful.  Are you a fine ebony princess?  Um, yeah.  See?  Yeah.  I called that one open.  I didn't think there were any black lesbians out there.  Oh, there's plenty.  I know.  There's plenty.  Yeah.  I'm just being an idiot.  Come on.  Okay.  Well, thanks for listening.  We appreciate that.  No problem.  All right.  You guys are great.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Ah, see, I detected the blackness in her voice.  I'm good at that.  Well, our average is pretty good when it comes to that. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Dwayne, what's going on?  Yo, man, I got wowed today, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, on the parkway, man.  And this girl come in front of me.  Yeah.  So I drove by her.  She said something.  So I had her pull over to the shoulder.  I pulled over, got in her car.  I started telling her about the show.  She said how she was this, like, kind of enthusiastic kind of girl.  So I told her I had a wowed sticker on.  She didn't believe me.  She backed the car up, saw it, immediately turned her chest towards me, and she said,  Why don't you whip them out yourself? 
[02:25:30]  Dude, I was juggling 36 D's in my hands, man.  Come on.  I don't believe it.  I'm serious.  You said she was going to keep, yo, I had her turn the station on.  Yeah.  You said she was going to keep the radio on to listen for me to call you guys.  Well, okay.  And I told her I was going to call you.  I'm freaking believable, man.  I don't believe it.  I was like, whoa.  I told her.  This whiffing out Wednesday works.  He was juggling.  It does, man.  It does.  All right, Dwayne.  Thanks, man.  You guys rock.  Bye.  Bye.  Get the wow on your vehicle. 
[02:26:00]  You might not be juggling them, but you'll see them.  These calls come in every single Wednesday.  We usually blow them off, but today we're focusing on it a little bit more today.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, I just got a wad on Hepstead Turnpike in Levittown.  Congratulations.  How was it?  Hey, it was a beautiful thing, man.  Yeah, was she high?  Yeah.  She looked like she was in her 30s, somewhere like that.  But, hey, I'll take them all, all right?  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  Take care, guys.  But, uh, syndication when Gay J stops playing the skin flute. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Bye.  Yeah, he loves The Rock, but he doesn't look at Trish Stratus or any of those hot babes  that the WWF has going on.  I guess not.  I guess not.  I don't know.  Let's go to Susan.  Hi, Susan.  How are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Hey.  What's up?  I...  Spaz is an ass.  Well, we know.  He hung up on me before.  You sound like a guy.  You sound like a little kid.  I'm on a cell phone and I'm walking.  You're...  Where are you walking?  I'm walking from work to my house. 
[02:27:00]  In what, uh, what town?  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Yep.  And what do you want to do for us today?  I wanted to play.  I guess it's my pants so I can go to the Up and Smoke tour.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Can you find a bush somewhere?  I don't need a bush.  That's the whole, uh, object of the game.  Okay.  Well, we've got to find out if we have any more Up and Smoke tickets.  We'll give them to you.  Okay.  You want to do it as you're walking to your house?  Well, you know, it's where I'm walking, like...  It's a park, but there's a lot of trees. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Why don't you find a tree you could, uh, duck behind?  I don't need to duck.  I'm just going to keep walking.  You're going to, you're going to do it as you walk.  Sure.  That's, uh, that's different.  Uh, it might, uh, might...  Okay, I'll stop walking.  See, for the Up and Smoke tickets, I'll stop walking.  All right, yeah, stop walking.  Get behind a tree.  Okay.  There's something very dirty about this.  Yes.  Behind a tree.  What are you wearing there?  I wouldn't...  What are you wearing?  My work uniform.  What is that?  I can't say.  Like a skirt?  Uh, no. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, the pants?  Those industrial pants?  No.  I just don't want people to find out that I'll get in a lot of trouble.  Well, what line, what line of work, what industry are you in?  Fast forward.  I'm a lifeguard.  Well, a lifeguard?  So you're wearing a bathing suit?  Yes.  Yes, sir.  And you're coming back from the pool in the park that you work at in Staten Island.  See, good girl, I'm giving it away.  Boy, that was...  I'm going to get fired.  That was tough to figure out.  You could have just.  I was calling live from the lifeguard, too, when Mark hung up on me. 
[02:28:30]  Thank you, Einstein.  There's not too many pools out here, okay?  All right.  Well, have you found a tree?  Yeah.  Okay.  Describe the scene.  There's no one on an empty beach.  And me with my red cell phone.  All right.  And, all right.  So you're going to, like, what, pull the bathing suit aside so you can get to the area?  Yeah, it's big.  It's big?  The bathing suit is an extra large.  They only come in one size. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  What kind of body do you have, Susan?  I'm beautiful.  You're beautiful.  They all say that.  What do you look like?  I'm 18.  Blue eyes, brown hair.  Mm-hmm.  I'm 5'7", 125.  What else?  Like, size 2 pants.  Size 2 pants.  I'm beautiful.  What about the top?  They're good.  They're good?  Good to go?  Yeah.  Medium size?  Medium.  Meanie-me's?  No.  All right. 
[02:29:30]  No, about a C.  All right.  Now, are you sitting down on the ground behind a tree?  Do I really need to sit?  Not really.  No, not really.  Okay.  Just describe what you're doing.  I'm standing on a bunch of, like, I don't know what these are, like, weeds all around me.  And there's a path that goes through them.  And I was walking, and then I stopped.  Someone's saying there's no park on Staten Island.  If you make me say the name of my park, I will get fired.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Or I'll get made fun of that. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, and he's saying Susan's line, no park on Staten Island with pool.  All right.  He's right.  There's no pool.  I'm a beach lifeguard, and I'm walking on the beach.  Ah.  Oh, cool.  I didn't want to say that.  I work at Wolfsburg Park.  All right.  Do we have tickets for this girl, Ben?  Go get Ben real fast.  I want to make sure we can hook her up.  All right.  So you're on a beach.  Yes.  And you're walking, and there's no one around.  No one.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't you pull the bathing suit aside?  Well, I want to know if you have the tickets first. 
[02:30:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, Ben's saying we don't have tickets.  We'll find them.  How about a scooter?  How about a scooter?  How about a scooter?  This girl's naked on a beach somewhere.  We can't get any more of the up-and-smoke tics?  Maybe.  But I'm not now.  Oh.  All right.  To get the tickets, I'll play.  You sure?  You've got to give me a prize list.  No, we'll give you something very cool, and we'll take your name, and we'll try to get  the tickets.  If not that, we'll give you something.  Can I punch spasm face?  Yeah.  You can do that.  I can come down and punch spasm face?  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Because that should be my prize, because I'm really pissed at him.  All right.  I called, and I said I wanted tickets, and he was like, yeah, we'll contact you by phone,  and hung up.  All right, Susan, let's get to What's in My Pants.  Let me play the theme song as you get ready to play, okay?  Okay.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[02:31:30]  How'd you like the mobile roll?  Huh?  Line eight, Anthony?  We'll go to line eight in a second.  Okay, Susan, so what's going on?  You're bathing suits to the side now?  Yep.  All right.  You're on a beach somewhere in Staten Island?  Yep.  Okay, you want to rub the phone up and down for us, please?  Sure.  Okay.  Eighteen-year-old girl.  Can you hear it? 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  It was a little low, but if you could do it again, up and down.  It was low, but very low.  We want to know why, because I don't know where the microphone is, but I'm going to find it.  All right.  Yeah, fire on the microphone.  Fire on the microphone.  That's it.  Okay.  All right.  That's up and down?  Yeah.  Now side to side.  I love this game.  And now a slow circular motion over the entire region. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  There's definitely something there.  Yeah.  Okay.  You can play along at home, by the way, if you're in the car.  Now, remember, don't tell us the answer until we ask you.  Okay.  Okay.  Opie?  Well, I think I need to hear side to side one more time.  Yeah, that's important.  If you will.  Okay.  Hold on.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And up and down one more time.  Up and down again, if you could. 
[02:33:00]  Whoa.  Boy, this is a tricky one.  Yeah.  I really wish I knew what it heard, but I hear you play all the time.  Like, you know, I want to know what my hair sounds like.  Okay.  Well, we're going to tell you in a second here.  Anthony?  I think I just need a round, a round one.  If you could, just...  Okay.  You anything.  Okay.  Hold on.  We're going to need some of that wax stuff that we were talking about earlier. 
[02:33:30]  You good?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, yeah.  We're thinking here.  It's very difficult.  I'm ready.  What are you saying?  A firmly...  A firmly.  A trim triangle.  All right.  He's saying a trim triangle.  You know something?  I'm going to go with... 
[02:34:00]  Everyone's screaming in their cars.  They know it.  You know something?  It was a little too uniform.  I'm going to say wood floor.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I'm getting looks here.  An 18-year-old girl with a wood floor?  But I'm going to say wood floor, and I know I'm getting abused for it, but there's just  something about the sound.  All right.  Hold on.  Jeff, the gay guy from Jersey.  He plays every time when we do this. 
[02:34:30]  Okay.  I'm going to try this again.  I'm batting 750 in the last eight tries.  Sound unheard.  She's from Staten Island, and those people have no belief in hygiene that she has a pool  rack full of Afro hair.  You hear the birds in the background?  There's a seagull.  Oh, that was his guess before.  Yes.  Okay.  My real answer after listening, wood floor with five o'clock shadow.  That's Jeff, the gay guy.  Okay.  Put your bathing suit back on.  Put your bathing suit back on.  I'm already walking.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:35:00]  The seagulls are following us.  The seagulls are chasing us.  Oh, my God.  So fired.  So fired I am.  I'm a disgrace to the lifestyle community.  It's turning into a scene from, uh, from birds.  Alfred Hitchcock's birds. 
[02:35:30]  At least, you know, I wouldn't lie to you.  I'm not lying.  I'm working on the beach.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wow.  How funny was that to hear the seagulls following us?  The seagulls.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Jeff, the gay guy says wood floor with five o'clock shadow.  I said a, um, a trimmed, uh, triangle.  And Anthony is going with a wood floor.  I'm saying wood floor.  Wood floor. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Susan.  Uh-huh.  Do I have to stump you to win?  Huh?  No, no.  Okay, because...  We don't want...  No.  You got it right.  Who got it right?  You did.  Triangle?  It's very short, but it's, uh...  All right.  It's trim, and I have very nice hygiene, and I don't want to hear about that.  All right.  Got to give it to you.  I'm hearing those seagulls still, though.  That is hilarious.  All right.  No, that's not...  Stop it. 
[02:36:30]  God damn.  Some things you just can't plan on this show.  Girl walking down the beach naked, and you hear seagulls falling.  That's...  That's funnier than the whole cycle work thing.  Okay.  Susan, congratulations.  Thanks for playing, uh, What's in My Pants.  And, uh, we're going to give you something very, very cool.  Are you...  All right.  Hold on.  Vinny wants to ask you a question.  Uh, Vinny, you're on the line with Susan.  Susan, what? 
[02:37:00]  Vinny, turn down your radio.  Turn down my radio?  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on today, man?  What's up, bro?  What's up?  You're on with Susan.  What's up?  Good.  All right.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  You don't know how to play.  All right, Susan, hold on the line.  We're going to give you something very cool, okay?  All right.  Thank you.  There she goes, Susan.  Somewhere on a beach in Staten Island, Anthony.  It's time to play. 
[02:37:30]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  All right, a little beach version.  Yeah.  Guess what's in my pants?  Yeah, that was the beach version.  Lynn, what's going on?  You're next at NAW.  Hey, guys.  That music was a little messed up, but listen, no radio.  Isn't that nice?  All right, thank you for that.  A lot of people have not turned down their radios today for some reason. 
[02:38:00]  I can finally listen and take directions.  All right, Lynn.  Anyway, I wanted to tell you guys that I'm leaving in a little while,  and I'm going to be on Route 17, and I'm willing to wow.  You're willing to wow if you see the wow signs on Route 17?  You bet.  Only if I see the wow signs.  No guys driving by.  I had guys driving by.  That's why the guys got to get the wow on the cars.  We're telling the ladies, only wow cars that have wow on them.  Even if they're, you know, 16 and driving illegally.  All right, what part of 17 will you be on?  Oh, geez. 
[02:38:30]  Part right by 287.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, that's where I'll be, and I guess that's it.  All right.  I have a syndication when I get to wow you two.  Ooh.  Ah, oh, mm-woop.  Ah, ah.  We're here every day.  Come on down.  Are you serious?  See, you know, I know.  You show us your fun bags.  I'll show you my man boots.  Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  See you guys later.  All right, Lynn.  Bye.  Happy wowing.  Let's go to Teresa.  Teresa, what's going on?  Teresa.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  I called you before.  I couldn't hear what was going on. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, that was you, the nightmare from the wow sticker stop.  Sorry, I couldn't hear.  You were revving the call.  They were revving the car up.  They were rubbing the car up?  Reven.  Reven.  Reven the car up.  Yes, all right?  Do you have problems with these?  Yes.  Oh, right now.  I just wanted to tell you that I love Gorilla.  You love Gorilla?  Yes, I do.  Ah.  Jeff Norris, you think he's hot?  He's good looking.  Yeah?  I didn't have a man, you know? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  All right, this is good.  I got a man.  I got a man.  I got a man.  I'm not stylish, all right?  Okay.  All right.  That's cool.  That doesn't imply anything.  Well, thank you.  I want to tell you guys I love you and syndication now.  All right.  Shut up!  Well, thank you, Teresa.  Thanks for wowing at the sticker stop today, okay?  Well, I wow you too.  All right.  Well, come on by anytime.  All right.  Shut up!  Wow.  All right.  Bye.  I'll talk to you later.  You stupid bitch. 
[02:40:00]  Ouch.  Wow.  Come on.  Stop playing my little clips.  That's nice, Anthony.  That's not nice.  Teresa wants to wow us.  Lisa.  Lisa, what's going on?  Well, it's Kyle, Lisa's son.  Lisa.  Ella.  Hi.  Hi.  Can you hear me?  My son wants me to wow everybody sitting here.  He's 11.  What?  Wait.  You're in the car with your kids, and one of them's 11, and they want you to wow. 
[02:40:30]  And my daughter's nine, and they love you, and they're like, Mom, come on.  There's a wow sticker.  You've got to wow somebody.  I don't know if that's, like, legal.  We're social services when you need them.  So you're going to whip out your fun bags in front of your little kids?  No, I'll have to turn toward the window.  But you should.  Oh, my God.  Oh, somebody protect the children.  Oh, my God.  Well, Lisa, good luck with that, okay?  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[02:41:00]  Someone take the children away.  Hey, Danny, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  How are you?  Listen up.  I was taking a blunt today.  What's going on today?  People are cursing.  They're not turning down their radios.  You can't curse on this program.  People didn't.  15-year-old kids want to fight.  There are just a couple of rules we must adhere to.  We'll say just about anything, but you can't curse on the radio, and all we do is ask you  to turn down your radio before you talk to us. 
[02:41:30]  You can't say the F word on the air.  Do you sit there and listen to the radio and watch TV and listen to HBO and hear the F word?  Right.  No.  No.  Big Jim from Somerset, do you think Stone or Amy is wowing people in rehab today?  You can only hope so.  Well, we really want to get Stone or Amy's sister on the phone.  See how she's doing.  We really want to get an update because we're a little concerned for her. 
[02:42:00]  Stone or Jack in rehab.  Yeah.  That was just a bad scene the other day.  All excited to play Stone or Spelling Bee.  We go to the champion, Amy, and all of a sudden we're talking to her mom as her mom's screaming  at us.  Turns out Amy just got out of rehab that morning, and they already found Coke on her.  It must be easy to get laid in rehab.  You get like a little bit of drugs with you.  A little blow.  Imagine that.  Hey, going to like the janitor's closet there.  You got a toot. 
[02:42:30]  I'm not saying it's ethical.  I'm just saying it must be easy.  Hey, Suzanne.  Hello.  What's up?  Well, my girlfriend and I are just getting on 70, and we're waiting to wow people, but  no one's got a wow sticker.  Oh, you've got people.  What's going on?  No one has a wow sticker.  If you saw one, you'd be wowing.  You guys are all prepared.  You've got two girls.  We are broad, undone, and everybody already waiting.  Ready to go.  Ready to go.  One girl's driving.  Ready to go.  I mean, I think the wow should go for the guys, too. 
[02:43:00]  Like, we should get a wow sticker, and then, you know.  Now, if guys whip out their junk, see, girls whip out their boobs.  It's fun.  Everyone loves it and enjoys it.  Guys whip out their junk.  You see cops pinning them to the roadway, beating them with their clubs, because that  isn't a thing that a lot of girls really want to see.  Right.  Right.  Right.  If you get some collateral damage with your boobing, with your wowing, like if somebody  that's not planning on seeing it, sneaks a peek, they're not going to mind. 
[02:43:30]  If a guy rips his junk out and a nun is driving by, there's going to be a problem.  I want to have a guy, like, right next to me in the car, picking up his nose right now  as we speak.  Well, don't wow him.  He doesn't have a sticker.  He doesn't have a wow sticker, but we saw some guy, but he was like, you know, like 80  years old with a wow sticker.  Well, wow him.  He wants to see it, too.  You can wow him, too.  We want to wow the young ones.  No, 80-year-old guys need the wows, too.  I need a wow.  No, I need a wow to get my heart going.  Yeah, you got to wow the old codgers.  You know something, Anthony? 
[02:44:00]  These girls are more than willing to whip him out.  I know.  We got to make an exception.  You want to give somebody a free wowing?  A free wowing right now.  All right.  Who's driving the car, Suzanne?  I am.  Okay.  What's the name of your friend?  Bea.  Bea?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Have Bea stick her fun bags up against the window.  Okay.  Stick them up against the window.  Bear breasts and start honking like crazy and tell me what happens to your right.  All right.  Stick them up against the window.  Let me honk the horn.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Well, there's no cars. 
[02:44:30]  Wait.  I have to wait until this car comes next to me right now.  Yeah.  Wait until there's a car next to me.  Oh, yeah.  That would be smart.  Oh, that was a girl.  She looked up at the door.  Nothing at all.  All right.  We need a guy.  We need a guy.  All right.  Yeah, it wouldn't be a good idea to do it to the girls.  Right.  Tell me what's going on.  Tell me what's going on.  Another check.  Okay.  Another check.  Well, some might be into it.  Start honking the horn.  I want to hear the horn.  When you see a guy.  Can you hear it?  What?  Yeah, they're beeping.  I hear the beeping. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, okay.  That guy just looked.  That guy looked?  He almost got into it.  Actually, he kind of swerved in between lanes.  Did he enjoy it?  He's trying to catch up to us now.  All right.  What road are you on?  Because we have a lot of listeners out there.  We're getting on the Parkway.  Right now, Parkway North by, like, at the 1.7.  Uh-oh.  Parkway North where?  Uh-oh.  We've lost them.  Oh, my God.  Suzanne. 
[02:45:30]  We lost Suzanne.  We'll never know.  We'll get so many guys wowing on the way home.  We'll never know where they are.  We lost them.  Okay.  We've got to take a break.  All righty.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Get ready.  Get ready.  Oh, my God.  And who is about the last day?  With a friend, Anthony.  N-E-W.  Anthony.  Yes.  A brand new sponsor to the O&A show, Mujan. 
[02:46:00]  Ah.  This is like wax stuff, right, Ant?  Yeah.  It's for waxing.  Waxing.  Oh, how about that most intimate area on the girl?  You don't want to have, especially with summer, going to the beach,  nothing worse than looking like you're cooking up some Jiffy Pop down there,  big padded wad down in the bottom of the bathing suit,  or worse yet, when it's poking out the sides.  Yeah, like weeds.  It looks like Larry from the Three Stooges.  Hey, look at me. 
[02:46:30]  I'm in a bikini.  Hang mo.  Get me out of the bikini.  Yeah.  Look at the hair just sticking out the sides like that.  You can't have that.  So, uh, Mujan.  Mujan.  Yeah, for ladies, waxing is the difference between having itchy, scratchy stubble  and silkier, sexier skin.  Yes.  You can tell a girl that waxes as opposed to a girl that shaves.  It's all stubbly, razor bombs and stuff like that.  Waxing, oh, nice and smooth.  Smooth as silk.  You'd never know there was hair there. 
[02:47:00]  That's right.  And it grows back finer, lighter, thinner hair.  And who needs a rash on their cheeks?  No, absolutely.  Rash on the cheeks.  You don't want that.  It's kind of a drag, ladies.  Take care of it down there.  So, uh, ladies and guys, get your ladies Mujan wax today.  Check them out.  Okay, Mujan is available at Dwayne Reed, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve's Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus.  And if you don't see Mujan, just ask your store manager to bring it in for you, okay? 
[02:47:30]  It's Mujan.  Livermore Wednesday.  What is that?  Like some kind of guy thing?  Like some kind of sexist guy thing?  Yeah!  You will not get away with this!  I wish you could just shut your big hammer and whip him out Wednesday!  Ooh, la, la.  We'll be an Anthony M-E-W.  I miss Farley.  Goddamn, do I miss Farley.  I saw Tommy Boy last night.  It was on.  I love that movie, man.  Housekeeping.  Oh, need sleeping. 
[02:48:00]  For the love of God!  Lauren!  Hello.  How are you, Lauren?  I'm great.  How are you?  There's no one on 17 with WOW stickers.  I'm actually just getting off 80 at this point as I'm old.  Okay.  No one on 80.  When is Spots or whoever going to get out here?  Earl.  Well, it's still very early in the WOW season.  But you're...  We hope guys would get the WOWs on their car.  Yeah, the guy's got to get the hint at this point.  Lauren, if you saw a WOW sign right now, what would you do? 
[02:48:30]  I don't know.  I mean, I'm already...  I brought off my glasses on, but I'm waiting.  But there's nobody...  Now I'm going into a section that's definitely not going to have them.  See, I don't know.  If I was a fan of this show, I would just go, you know what?  This thing just might work.  I'm going to put the WOW in my car and see what happens.  The girls are out there.  I'm not doing it!  Well...  And, like, I asked Spots again last week, and when is somebody going to come out here for the bumper stickers?  Where do you want us to go, Lauren?  Well, in Bergen County.  We'll go to Bergen County very soon.  Great.  Thank you. 
[02:49:00]  All right, Lauren.  We love your syndication now.  Thank you.  There goes Lauren.  Another lady on the line.  Sherry.  Sherry, what's going on?  Sherry?  Hello?  Yellow.  Hello?  Hi, Sherry.  Hi, Sherry.  It's Carrie.  Oh, Carrie.  Sherry, Sherry, Sherry.  Whatever.  I'll speak to her in her native tongue.  I'll be...  Oh, you're going to come back like...  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[02:49:30]  Carrie.  Yes?  Do you have a better cell?  Yes, you do.  Okay, what's going on?  Hurry up before we lose it again.  I hate this.  I hate this.  I have to say that.  I'm waiting for a woman to allow me.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Are you another lady trying to say that you would wow but you're not seeing wow stickers on the highway?  You got it.  Okay, thank you.  That's simple.  See, the ladies are out there.  They are willing to do this.  All you have to do is get your wow in your car and just forget about it and see what happens.  I love when the phone does that boing, boing thing. 
[02:50:00]  Boing, boing, boing, boing.  Denise, how are you?  Good.  How are you guys?  Pretty good.  I'm on 80 West going home from work every Wednesday wearing a button-down shirt, leaving work, everything.  No wow stickers.  No wow.  Guys.  Nothing out here.  And don't wait for a wow sticker.  You can put the homemade wow on your car.  That's what I'm hoping for.  Nothing.  I see nothing.  Even dirt written on the back of a truck I'm waiting for.  Nothing.  That works, too, because a lot of the truck drivers do that for us.  Nothing's out here.  All right, Denise.  I'm so disappointed. 
[02:50:30]  But if you saw a wow, you would do it?  Most definitely.  Okay.  I'm ready.  All right.  Thank you, Denise.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  See you?  See?  See you guys?  There's a million of them on the line today.  Liz, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I'm sitting in traffic approaching the Lincoln Tunnel.  There's guys all around me, all around me.  And they're checking me out, but they don't have wow stickers on their car.  And I'm all set and ready to go.  Oh, man.  And I'm, like, dressed up because I'm going to dinner in the city.  I look good, and I'm ready to wow, and there's nothing.  Nothing. 
[02:51:00]  And all you would have to do is see a wow sticker or a wow sign or wow in the dirt, and  you will do it for us, right?  I've seen wow in the dirt, and it's just not here.  I'm feeling very lost.  All right, Liz.  Thank you.  Yeah, bye.  Now we've got a girl in a convertible, Anthony.  I've seen a ton of wows out there, but obviously we need more wows on the highway.  Kristen, what's going on?  Hi, yes.  So I'm stuck in traffic on 287 going north.  Yeah.  I'm in a convertible, and I'm looking to wow somebody, but I don't see any stickers.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:51:30]  Guys, I can't stress.  You put a wow on your vehicle.  You see naked boobs on your drive home.  It makes the traffic seem less annoying.  It makes the commute just a little bit better.  Wow.  All right.  Well, thank you, Kristen.  You're welcome.  All right.  You want a sticker, the self-addressed stamped envelope still?  We're taking those, aren't we?  Yes, we are.  888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106. 
[02:52:00]  Just put the wow sticker on there and WNW.  In the meantime, you just put it in there any way you can.  All right.  Tape, written on the dirt, whatever.  Hey, Vinny, what's going on?  Yo, ONA, what's going on?  How are you?  All right.  It works, man.  I got my homemade sticker on there, and I got wowed.  Oh, congratulations.  It works, man.  I'm starting to stay on the way home.  I've got to make sure I take it up before I get home.  My wife will kill me.  All right.  Thank you, Vinny.  Cool, guys.  Syndication now.  We still had hundreds upon hundreds of winners today in the little wow promotion.  Look at this guy, Mike, from Connecticut.  I put a wow sticker on my truck, and I got nothing. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  Well, it's like fishing, Mike.  You're not going to get a fish every time out, but if you're patient, it'll happen.  There are plenty of girls out there that are wowing people with wow stickers.  Okay.  Let's go to Heather.  We're going to seg into what did we learn on the ONA show in a minute here.  212-757-1027.  Heather, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Great.  Well, this is a problem. 
[02:53:00]  See, I didn't really know what the wow stickers were all about because I've seen three today,  and I was, like, chuckling because I knew that you guys had, like, the Wasted on Wednesday show.  What?  And so I was cracking up, like, just thinking about, like, being Wasted on...  Heather?  Yes?  Hello?  We do a show called Wasted on Wednesday?  Isn't it?  When...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Who does that?  No, it's called Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Where did you hear...  Wait, didn't...  It's...  Where did you hear Wasted on Wednesday? 
[02:53:30]  I heard it from...  Well, I heard it from my cousin first, too.  That's what I thought it was about, and I thought you guys, like, had, like, a bartender, like,  originally come there or something.  Oh, my God.  Is that...  That's a couple different stories.  All right.  Well, that's what I thought it was about, so...  No, Heather, it's simple.  It's called Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Guys and girls are finding out as well.  They put wow in their car.  It could be a homemade wow sign.  It could be a wow sticker.  It could be wow in the dirt.  If you see that and you feel like whipping out your boobs, then you do that, and there's 
[02:54:00]  a lot of ladies doing that for us.  That's what wow is all about.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So bad.  So bad.  So bad.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, I was just on 287 North, just past 8-11.  Yeah.  I was listening to the show, left my ass, my rear ass, and I drew a homemade wow black  marker.  Yeah.  I stuck it in the window, and sure enough, a red Mustang pulled up next to me.  She whipped him out, juggled him, and drove off.  Right on.  There you go. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you.  Come on, guys.  Thank you, Dave.  Syndication.  All right.  Syndication.  Just syndication.  Yeah.  It's gotten to that point.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hello.  I own China store on Woodward and Green, and I deliver China store on my scooter.  I got a little wall sticker on the back.  You got one of those little scooters?  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Wait.  Wait.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'm begging.  Are you for real?  Yes.  I'm for real.  I own China store on Woodward and Green. 
[02:55:00]  Where?  CNN and Green.  Really?  Yes.  How about that?  Syndication when my foreskin falls off.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I love you, guys.  I really don't believe that was an Asian gentleman at all.  Are you sure, Anthony?  I would bet against him.  Jimmy?  Yeah, he hung out.  Let's play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show today.  Don't forget, Britney Spears on Fox tonight, Hawaiian special. 
[02:55:30]  Get your 55-gallon drums of Vaseline.  And they're doing a chat on Fox.com.  I forgot the time.  Ten.  Ten o'clock tonight, Fox.com.  F me, baby, one more time.  We're hoping to get Britney through you guys, so ask some wacky questions for us.  Let us know what happens with that.  Survivors on tonight, CBS, 8 o'clock.  Can't wait.  Survivor.

[02:56:00]  All right, Anthony.  It's time to play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show, 212-757-1027.  One-eyed trouser snake checking in from Anna's panties.  Today I learned that if O&A don't give their opinion about a chick in the studio, something is up, if you know what I mean.  Troy from Jersey.  Every day he gets a good one in.  What did I learn?  I learned Psycho Mark is going to need a hell of a lot of horticulture to forget today's events. 
[02:56:30]  Horticulture, yes.  Dan from Pinebrook.  What I learned on the O&A Show today, seagull sounds like an eagle.  Sometimes.  Yes.  Chris from Jersey.  I learned I'll be able to tell who Mark is at the next road show.  He'll be the one with the stretch marks around his mouth.  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  Medic from Brooklyn.  I think it should be What Did Mark Learn Today?  Gary from Jersey.  I learned that Mark switched from smoking joints to smoking cigars. 
[02:57:00]  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Goals from Brooklyn.  I learned that Psycho Mark shops in the other aisle in the porch shop.  The other aisle.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, dudes, I learned what goes around comes around and Psycho Mark took it in the back.  I also learned that Spaz is still the dumbest F in the world. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Because.  Thank you.  That guy goes on and on every night.  Andrew, what did you learn on the show?  Guys, I'm going to go with the obvious one and say that I learned that Mark is gay.  Thank you.  Someone had to say it.  It's an indication when Anthony gets his honorary diploma.  Scott, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I learned that you guys are going to end up mysteriously in 55-gallon drums tomorrow.  And Psycho Mark is going to be the proprietor of Six Fags Gay Adventure. 
[02:58:00]  Thank you.  Didn't we learn anything else besides the Psycho Mark thing today?  The picture is from today's event with Psycho Mark.  We'll be on foundrymusic.com.  We sent them off to Steve.  It'll take them a little while to go through them, but yeah.  Brian, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that Hawaii is located on Psycho Mark's hand.  On Psycho Mark's hand?  Yeah.  Jim, what did you learn? 
[02:58:30]  Actually, it's Tim.  Tim, sorry.  Spadden's an idiot, of course.  Yeah.  I learned that the next time before I mess around with a girl, I'm going to check for man junk.  Yeah.  So it was a good suggestion, a good thing to do.  Yeah.  Check for man junk.  Man junk.  And never, never let my friends tie me up.  Yes.  Never.  All right, man.  All right, syndication when Spadden gets a brain.  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  This guy learned something yesterday.  I learned really faithful listeners get a special surprise at the end of the show.  We'll have that again tonight? 
[02:59:00]  Oh, we do have that again tonight?  Another special surprise?  Very good.  When a joke is pulled on Psycho Mark, he may not rip off bathroom doors, but the closet  doors come flying open.  Very good.  Very good.  I'm Mikey from Jersey, man.  Hey, Tony, what did you learn?  Hey, today I learned that Psycho Mark is going to move into a three-room apartment in Grinch  Village.  Syndication.  Oh, okay.  When Spadden...  Today I learned that Jay Moore's real name is Anna. 
[02:59:30]  Tom, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that I'm not the only one getting wasted on Wednesday.  All right.  Very good.  Obviously.  Thank you.  All right.  11.  All right.  Let's go to 11.  Mike, what did you learn?  Hey, O&A. 
[03:00:00]  I learned that Psycho Mark retains the title as Pickle Boy Jones.  And I also learned that the Invisible Man got his own series.  Yes, he did.  I've been hearing those commercials.  Thank you, Mike.  Okay.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Anthony, Timmy's on the line.  Oh, yeah?  Anthony, Timmy's on the line.  Thank you, Anthony.  Timmy, what did you learn on the show today?  Timmy!  Hello?  Yeah, what's...  Timmy! 
[03:00:30]  Vinny, Vinny.  Oh, Vinny.  Oh, wow.  That's not funny at all.  Spaz wrote Timmy.  What's up, Vinny?  I learned if you wanted to find any naked girls on the beach, to follow the seagulls.  Very good.  Yes.  That was my favorite thing today.  That was hilarious.  Take care, guys.  Thank you, Vinny.  All right.  Mike from Staten Island.  I learned that I work with a girl who plays What's in My Pants.  That's a good obscure one.  I just looked at Fox.com. 
[03:01:00]  The chat is at 9.30, not 10.  I'm warming up for the chat tonight.  9.30, Britney Spears, a chat, Fox.com.  Yeah.  9.30.  When is the show on?  9.  9?  Is it only a half hour long?  Well, it's got to be an hour show, no?  Go to Fox.com.  I'm sure it's all over it.  Yeah, you're going to have to get on there anyway, because it's going to be just a mess tonight.  Bullwinkle from the Bronx.  Today, I learned that Ever Seen a Grown Man Naked is the funniest goddamn clip you guys play. 
[03:01:30]  Ever seen a grown man naked?  I like playing with myself.  I play with myself all day long.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we're done.  Yeah, another day.  Hey, Ann, I learned something today.  What did we learn?  I learned that some people out there do get butt sex on prom night. 
[03:02:00]  On prom night.  Butt sex.  It's a hell of a move.  Taking the little girl out of the house with the parents looking, smiling out the front door.  With the brand new corsage on her chest.  They hop into the limo.  Now, fast forward.  End of the prom night.  She's getting butt sex.  What do you do in between to get to that point?  Lots of roofies.  Steve.  Roofies.  Steve. 
[03:02:30]  How are you doing, guys?  How are you?  I learned again that duct tape was a very important part of the show.  Yes.  You've got to love the duct tape.  Yeah, between Mark and Spass.  You're going to use me a lot of it.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Kelly from Jersey.  I learned that King Gimp gets funnier every time I hear it.  King Gimp.  All right, Ann.  We've got a surprise.  We do.  In the middle of commercials.  We'll come back real fast for a quick surprise.  Stay there.  Booze.  The world's universal language. 
[03:03:00]  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  We'll pull that one sheet.  Opie and Anthony.  The brain is in their pants.  1027.  I believe you.  I need to go.  Hey, Anthony.  Brand new sponsor on the O&A show.  Got to roll.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter, Opie.  Yeah, we've got to welcome them to the program.  You can get this damn thing at Sharper Image.  We've had them around here for the last couple of months,  and we fly all over the office with these things.  They're cool.  It's a lot of fun, man.  We use them, like I've said, all the time. 
[03:03:30]  It's very hard to walk around a corner now  without somebody barreling down the hallway on these things.  Why don't you explain the Razor Rollerboard Scooter, Anthony?  Okay.  You've got an image in their brains right now.  It's a very cool, gleaming, stainless steel and aluminum inline scooter.  It's got inline skate wheels on it, and it's got like a handlebar contraption, fully adjustable.  It packs down to a real small size, too, but you open it up, and you just tool around on this thing.  Yeah, it's a hot product.  A lot of the magazine's talking about these things. 
[03:04:00]  We love them.  We haven't tried them outside yet, but I can imagine it would be pretty cool on the outside as well.  And everyone loves them, kids, teens, college students.  I've seen people commute on these things.  What, are you going to, like, sketch?  Grab the back of a cab or something.  Although we don't endorse that.  No, you can get around pretty fast with this.  Yeah.  They have a little brake, tiny little brake, so if it's going too fast, you can push down on it.  You know, I just discovered the brake today.  As a matter of fact, I tried to turn really sharp, and I laid the thing down, 
[03:04:30]  knocked the garbage over by the phones, all over Stinky.  It's pretty funny.  I'm a hazard on these things.  They're a lot of fun, though.  Yeah.  And you could get these things at Sharper Image, Anthony.  Yes.  Visit one of their stores.  Go online at sharperimage.com.  I'm sure they have a picture of it.  Or you could give them a call, 1-800-344-4444.  That's 1-800-344-4444.  And if you're the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027, 10th and 11th? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  All right, we'll give away two of these things.  10th and 11th callers at 212-757-1027 will win a razor roller board courtesy of Sharper Image, all right?  Right.  All right.  You can also win by visiting any New York area Sharper Image store and fill out an entry blank.  Each store will give away five razors on Sunday, June 25th.  No purchase necessary.  Winner need not be present.  All right.  Let's go to frostoe.  Let's go to bet.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go. 
[03:05:30]  Let's go. </pre>
