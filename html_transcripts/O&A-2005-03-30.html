<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a “Cherry Darts” game.  Two naked porn stars, Candy (a 20-year-old from Ohio) and Star, lay on a couch while contestants threw whipped-cream-dipped cherries at them. Candy, present in the studio, engaged in sexually explicit conversation with the hosts, detailing her sexual preferences, including her experiences with midgets and dwarfs, and her early career in the adult film industry, including her first time filming with a 50-year-old man. The hosts and Candy provided commentary on the contestants' throws, focusing on accuracy and proximity to the targets’ buttocks.  The segment highlighted the show's production staff's inadequate preparation, citing paperwork issues and overcooked Pop-Tarts.  Numerous contestants (Justin, Velez, John, Alex, Lewis, Danny, and others) participated, with many jokes made about their ethnicities. The winners of several heats competed in a final round for a MiFi device; Justin ultimately won.  The hosts frequently used offensive language throughout the game.  Following the game, a substantial portion of the show focused on the relationship between intern Noah and Candy. Candy revealed details of their weekend together, including their sexual activities and locations, in explicit detail.  Jim Norton discussed his own missed opportunity with Candy, lamenting that Noah had sex with her for free. Candy called in to further elaborate. The conversation continued with explicit detail regarding Noah and Candy's encounters.  

Jim Norton then recounted his frustrating attempt to hire Candy for sex, initially quoted at $1000 and later $500. He was upset not by the price but by the lack of a discount given their prior acquaintance, especially considering Noah's free weekend with her. This led to a discussion about the perceived value of Norton's career in attracting women, his struggles with sex addiction, and his parents' reactions to his on-air revelations.  A humorous phone message from Norton's mother, using euphemisms to express concern and offering advice based on Dr. Phil, was played. Norton further detailed his weekend escapades, including a visit to a Bunny Ranch.  Pictures of Candy were shown. This segment concluded with the start of an eggnog drinking contest, and further discussion and reading of explicit text messages between Noah and Candy. Opie, Anthony, Ben, and intern Noah were all present in the studio.

The eggnog drinking contest involved ten contestants in the studio and five remotely. The studio was modified with garbage pails replacing the "lesbian couch" for those who might vomit. Contestants introduced themselves, some referencing websites (including porn sites) and message boards. One mentioned prior legal trouble. The rules were simple: one glass of eggnog per minute; vomiting or urinating resulted in disqualification. The winner received a MiFi device.  The contest involved descriptions of the eggnog's texture ("creamy, thick, warm, clumpy, viscous"), contestants' reactions, and commentary on its taste ("old jizz yellow," "pancake batter").  Several contestants vomited; one mentioned having had stomach surgery. The hosts and guests made various comments, referencing sports teams and celebrities.  Multiple contestants dropped out due to vomiting.  Pat and John made it to the final rounds, with Pat ultimately winning after consuming a significant amount of eggnog. One host hit his head on a window during the competition.  The contest's final segment focused on Pat, described as a "fat guy," who consumed 70 double shots of eggnog, resulting in copious amounts of vomit. Martini Steve calculated the caloric intake. The hosts and guests frequently made crude remarks about Pat’s condition, his diabetes, and previous loss of a toe.  Phone calls from listeners were interspersed with humorous, often vulgar, exchanges among the hosts and guests.  The segment concluded with Pat being declared the winner, despite his state, followed by additional commentary and humorous reflections.

[00:03:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen. 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really fucking stupid.  Disney is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  What is all the walkie-talkies now?  I don't know.  What the hell's going on?  Walkie-talkies.  Dude, it's just a stupid radio thing.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes tops.  All right, the cherries are en route.  The cherries are en route.  Clear a passageway.  Jeez.  It's like Secret Service out there.  Yeah.  Remember the old days we would just do something like this? 
[00:04:30]  We needed four people.  There's probably, I don't know, a staff of 20 trying to figure out how to get this Cherry  Darts thing done.  Can't work it out.  I've still not seen one girl in the studio, one contestant in the studio.  All I've seen so far are the cherries.  Well, I haven't even seen the whipped cream.  We have to meet.  Yeah.  Well, we're just...  You want to go bring the girl in?  Yeah.  Can we come in?  Sure.  Do we have any producers around that know what they're doing?  Steve's running around with his head chopped off.  Hello.  Hey, Candy.  We were looking at your pictures yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  Which ones?  Which ones?  Candy, you have to come on the mic so you can chit-chat a bit.  She wants to go back to bed.  She saw the couch and started laying down.  It's a good sport.  You really are.  What's going on, Candy?  Absolutely nothing, as a matter of fact.  No, you were having a problem filling out the paperwork, I noticed.  Yes.  What stumped you?  That was Noah's fault.  Yeah?  What stumped you, though?  He was trying to cut, copy, and paste, and it was all his fault.  I had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, okay.  You're in town to shoot? 
[00:05:30]  I'm in town in the process of trying to get things together for a movie I am trying  to get together.  Candy and the Land of the Midgets.  Yes.  You're the one that likes the midgets, then.  I am the one.  Can you, like, do something with a midget on our show?  I, if you can find me one, bring him on down.  We'll find one.  Give me ten minutes.  Any midgets out there that want to be with a porn star, watch this.  And she's hot.  Bring him on down.  And if you happen to be near 111th, uh, West 57th Street, you can come down now. 
[00:06:00]  I own so much midget porn, it is the opposite.  Would you, would you, would you say perform oral treats on a midget, would you do that?  Oh yeah, bring him on down.  What is it about midgets that turns you on?  Uh, just the novelty of.  The novelty.  Just a snow white fetish.  Is it like you're picturing him just on top of you?  No, I want to be on my knees and him standing behind me and we're still at equal level.  Oh, at the equal height.  That is hot.  And he's taking you from behind.  Yes.  That's great.  And that gets you all excited.  Oh yeah.  Little midget hands wrapping around your boobies. 
[00:06:30]  Where's Rich Voss when we need him?  I've never personally been introduced to a midget.  Really?  No.  But you watch midget porn all the time.  Yes.  You never met.  Would you mind if he had like a little elf hat on and midget clothing?  No, that'd be super hot.  Wow.  You are weird.  I love it.  We've got to have that in the studio.  Yes, we do.  Any midgets, you've got to show up, but you have to wear an elf hat.  A little elf shoes.  Please, come on down.  Now, where are you from?  Originally, or where do I live right now?  Do you live in the area?  I live in Ohio. 
[00:07:00]  So you could come down in a day or two notice if we find midgets, right?  Okay, good.  I come down in a three hour notice.  It's an hour and a half.  All right, we will find a midget and we'll do it next week during the free play week.  I could hear the call.  Is he hot?  You know, I don't go out with just anybody.  I like them real hot.  I'd like an attractive midget, please.  I like a nice ass.  I could kneel.  Well, she's got a kneel.  How about a dwarf?  What's the difference?  Exactly, good point. 
[00:07:30]  That's what I wanted to hear.  Well, I think, see, now...  Literally, you'll work for me.  All right, good.  People get it confused.  I think you like the dwarfs.  Midgets are like regular people, only smaller.  Okay.  The dwarf is the one that you always see in, like, the Oompa Loompas, and is that the kind  you like?  The little dwarfs?  Either way.  Either way.  Either way.  As long as you're little.  How about a legless guy?  Which type of Y chromosome deformity do you seek? 
[00:08:00]  We're going to cast your movie for you.  Oh, I am hoping so.  We have all the confidence in the world at our abilities.  We will find midgets for your midget porno.  Just walk up to them in the street.  Go, do you want to fool around with a hot chick?  I've never seen one in person.  You've never seen a midget in person?  It's a laugh riot.  You probably didn't.  You just thought it was a baby.  Ah, go chase yourself.  So what do you want to get done with this movie?  What kind of scenes with the midgets?  Actually, what we're going to do is like a Snow White kind of medieval. 
[00:08:30]  I told you.  Yeah, exactly.  You need seven?  Candy.  Well, I want as many as possible.  Does that turn you on so much thinking of seven dwarfs just like all over you, touching  you everywhere?  Midget gang bang.  Midget gang bang.  There's a guy that says he'll cut his legs off to be in the porno.  And then he'll wear wacky shoes on his stumps for you.  Hey, if we could get two midgets, would you let one stand behind you, and then would  you perform a Hummer on one at the same time?  Of course.  How hot would that be?  Well, it would be fun to watch. 
[00:09:00]  It would be hot to watch there, Jimmy?  Or you could get like three, four, five.  Let's see.  Okay, yeah.  Five would work.  I could do five at once.  Five at once.  My nephew's ten.  How about if I gave him a cigar?  I've got two hands.  I've got two hands.  I've got two hands.  All right.  I got the five figured out.  Yeah, of course.  I was trying to figure it out until you said I've got two hands.  Okay.  I got it.  I got it now.  That'd be great.  There's a poor guy that got a boat to his head that can't get laid, and here we are trying  to hook up a midget.  Five midgets.  Five midgets.  That's actually one real person.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[00:09:30]  Wow.  So how many features have you made?  Actually, I've only been in the industry for about two.  Yeah, she's young.  Three or four months now, actually.  Three or four months?  You're 20, right?  Yes, 20.  You're 20 years old.  When did you turn 20?  August.  She is almost a teen.  You were 19 just a few months ago.  Yes, I was.  And were you in high school a couple of years ago?  Yes, as a matter of fact.  Just a couple of short years ago.  Graduated in 02.  You did? 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Class of 02.  But we were on the air before we got fired.  She was roaming the hallways of a high school.  Putting heart genetic malformations.  Candy's really hot, too.  That's great.  Yeah, we know the other girls here.  Trust us.  We know.  We want to talk to Candy.  And how did you get into the adult film industry?  Through a friend of mine, Destiny St. Clair. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah?  She's also based out of Cleveland.  She's been trying to get me to do it for years now.  Finally, like three days before she was leaving, she's like, you're going with me?  I'm like, yeah, sure.  Is Cleveland becoming the porno capital of the world?  No, there is no porn in Cleveland.  I go to L.A. once a month.  Did you have a lot of sex in school and stuff growing up?  I have always been quite of an info.  A lot of sex.  Yes.  And then, so porn was just kind of a natural progression.  Pretty much.  What was the first one like?  Were you nervous?  Not really. 
[00:11:00]  No?  No, I'm a huge exhibitionist, so it didn't really...  Well, we...  Do you have on underpants?  No.  Yeah, now that we...  Now that we know you, I guess she could get naked, right?  Uh-huh.  Wait, do we have to cover the...  Oh, God.  Oh, Christ on us, Pony.  Crap again.  What are we covering?  We've got to cover the goddamn windows.  Why?  Because there's some people in here that don't like nude women.  What?  We can't think of a chance of...  Kick them out.  The weird part is, it's all guys here.  You're the only female, except for the female listener, and she doesn't mind, but... 
[00:11:30]  Well, who should we worry about?  Why are we covering the windows?  Time to get the New York Times out.  Oh, Steve wants to go cover the windows, and the newspapers burst into flames when he does  stuff.  I feel bad for the listeners that can't see what we're doing, though.  Don't worry, it doesn't look like they're seeing much anyway.  Yeah, they're passing out.  They're crashing.  They've been here since one in the morning.  Yeah, the guys that brought the ribs, they're now crashing hard.  Real hard.  God.  Why didn't they...  Oh, God.  What?  Why didn't they do this earlier?  When everyone was running around saying, what should we do?  Just when I thought Ben was useless. 
[00:12:00]  I know.  I'm just kidding.  Ben rocks.  No, I mean, nothing's getting done here.  You're not wearing any underpants at all.  No.  That's very sexy.  Would you like to see?  A quick flash would be nice.  You just can't take it off yet, because there's...  Well, she's...  Pierce twice.  It's just like every girl in Cleveland.  She's so hot.  I love Cleveland chicks.  They're the hottest chicks.  Yeah, I love chicks from Cleveland.  What actress do people tell you you look like?  Kate Hudson and Heather Graham.  Really?  Yeah.  Those would be the two I get.  No one ever says Cameron Diaz?  No.  I see the Kate Hudson.  I see that a little bit.  I see a little Kate Hudson. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Lovely.  And she's pierced down below, huh?  Twice.  Twice?  I only saw one.  They're both...  Nine piercings.  Here, come here, babe.  Nine piercings?  There's a hoop and a barbell.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy Toledo.  You like that, Jimmy?  Fantastic, yeah.  He had his hands in his pocket when he was looking, grabbing, grabbing his plumpness.  Remember?  Keith, what's going on?  Someone has to tell us what's going on because my guys have just failed us today.  We are going downstairs with all the paperwork and everyone's going to fill out their paperwork 
[00:13:00]  and we're going to start hustling people up.  They're going to start filling out the nine-page form now?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  We're expediting the process as we speak.  Like, why haven't these people been filling out forms since we got here this morning?  Don't we have five people up here already, though?  Yes, five people are up here.  They are ready to go.  And the rest of the people, they took their identification, checked their ID, and processed  all the paperwork to be filled out. 
[00:13:30]  You know, this is just a stupid radio show, right?  You know, this isn't the precinct.  We don't take all day to do things.  Like I said, the good old days where we took the X on the piece of paper and filed them  in worked for me.  I know.  I remember that.  It was one sheet of paper with, like, a paragraph on it.  They just had to sign it.  How did they not have been handed stuff to sign already?  It is quarter after eight.  How did they not have shit to sign?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because Ben is, you know, crapping and puking still somewhere.  Ben would have got this done. 
[00:14:00]  Where's Eric?  When we first came in.  Where's Sex Bagel?  He thought it was important to get me more Pop-Tarts.  But now I haven't seen them.  That was probably the least important thing to do today.  No offense, Obe.  I agree.  But I'm sure you will agree, yes.  That getting your Pop-Tarts.  Well, all I asked to get them cooked up for me.  What happened to your Pop-Tarts, by the way?  They overcooked.  They overcooked.  I come in here and they're black.  I've never seen Burp Pop-Tarts.  They were cooked up perfectly and then Steve put his hat down on them for a second. 
[00:14:30]  It's just, yeah, our producers are kind of stupid.  Everyone knows you just cook them for a minute.  Those are burnt.  You just eat up Pop-Tarts.  You don't cook them.  They're all pre-cooked.  Yeah.  You just eat them up real fast in a toaster.  That's it.  A minute.  Even you could cook a Pop-Tart, right?  Yes.  A girl that's a blonde.  I'm a very good cook.  A blonde.  The paper is almost up so we can get her naked.  Steve, where's Sex Bagel?  How is this paperwork not been filled out?  Eric is downstairs corralling the next five guys that are going to be coming up. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  So we're bringing them up in groups.  Five at a time.  The building is utterly paranoid that we're going to break something, blow something up, and...  Well, bad for the fucking building.  Enough with the fucking building already worrying.  We didn't do anything wrong.  They have every right considering what happened last time.  It happens.  You know, the show that we can't talk about anymore.  Right.  I remember that one.  Okay.  Yes.  I was asking about her first movie.  What was that like, and what was the scene, and...  You know, I'd like to know.  You walk in, and what is it, the set? 
[00:15:30]  Actually, I worked with an older man.  He was probably around 50, as a matter of fact.  So your first porno movie was with a 50-year-old guy.  And his wife taped it.  His wife taped it?  Yes.  I don't know if you ever heard Brooke Hunter.  No.  No.  No.  Maybe that was for their private collection.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  It was a little shady.  Yeah, this will be in Hollywood.  My wife's going to film it, and I'm going to bang you.  He had a video camera.  I blew him in the car, and he's going to send me a check.  So you walk in, and what is it, just his house? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, actually, it was.  No set?  Just his house?  He films a lot of his house, actually.  Yeah?  Yes.  Very professional, or was it kind of, just, all right, get on the bed, and. . .  No.  Actually, it was on the pool table.  On the pool table?  Yeah.  Oh, she said it.  And did it start out with a little oral?  Oh, of course.  So you, you know, what was the plot?  You're shooting pool?  No, actually, because he's actually a lawyer, as a matter of fact.  That's great.  And so he was doing a movie set about, like, people needing law advice or whatnot. 
[00:16:30]  Sure, sure.  So that's how it started off.  So you walk in, you need a lawyer.  Exactly.  And you're like, hi, I need a ho-ho-ho-ho.  Ho-ho-ho.  The door's closed, by the way, so you can get naked any time now.  Oh, yeah.  One moment, please.  Sure.  She is fantastic.  She's so perky.  I'll say she is.  Wow.  Yeah, those are 20-year-old boobs.  Wow.  Very nice.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, wow.  Nice tattoo on the back.  Big, huge tattoo right above the target area, Anthony. 
[00:17:00]  Terrific.  Must give some applause.  Very nice.  Candy's very, very nice.  You sure are lovely.  That's great.  She hasn't been ravaged by time or anything.  No, you still got everything happening there.  Very nice.  Very lovely.  Naked.  By the way, everyone's calling in going, after seeing candy all hot and nice here, you'll  definitely get a hooker tonight.  No, I won't.  Oh, right.  No.  Jimmy's going to get all worked up.  Jimmy's swearing off hookers.  I've spent a lot of money doing awful things. 
[00:17:30]  I see.  Yeah, but I won't tonight.  No.  Maybe.  You don't?  No, maybe.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It was a positive no, and it's like, no, maybe.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It's kind of like taking somebody to dinner, but you're just cutting out the dinner time.  What time do you need me?  Right after the show.  Wow.  He ain't kidding either, Candy.  And you think I am?  All right, Jimmy.  We got a love connection.  Yeah, I love her.  She'll probably be out of my range anyway.  She's hot.  He's got a big hog, though. 
[00:18:00]  No, I don't.  Most of his friends have seen it.  I'll put it in my hand.  Candy.  Turn off the camera.  No, it's very average right now anyway.  You've got to give me some time to get worked up.  I'm packing like two right now.  Well, come here and put it in my mouth and they'll take care of things.  Jesus.  Jesus.  My hog is very average.  She's a porn girl.  If the midget chick comes in, I'll be happy to whip it out and show it to her and measure  it against her face.  Her little puffy hand.  Yeah.  Look at this.  It hits your torso from your mouth.  Well, let her feel it through the jeans.  It's soft.  We don't need a look. 
[00:18:30]  I can change that.  Get over there.  It's soft.  Tim?  Candy, what do you think?  It's fine?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Her face just turned a little pink there.  What do you think, Candy?  Oh, I'm absolutely thrilled.  She's lovely.  Goddamn Jimmy's going to get laid again.  She's moaning a little.  That's good, right?  Oh, yeah.  Slightly wet at the moment. 
[00:19:00]  She has lovely...  She's just staring at me.  Yeah, this is great.  You are a nymph.  She doesn't even know where she is anymore.  She grabbed his pants and now it's like...  Oh, that's perfect.  Now Jim's just gazing down at her womanhood.  Nakedness.  Nice.  And he's grabbing himself again.  And then he's got that whacked out look again.  I just want to look.  It's just nice.  You get a whacked out look, though.  I'm just looking at her area.  That's the pervity that pops out.  It's really sexy.  It's really beautiful. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Moving on.  I must say, yeah, there's something going on between these two.  Yeah.  I'm just looking.  She doesn't mind me looking.  No, not at all.  I won't touch them.  What do you think, Candy?  About?  Jimmy?  I'm in love.  Stop rubbing yourself.  She's really sexy.  She's really sexy.  All right.  Why don't you see what's going on there now?  It's a little bit better.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're getting there. 
[00:20:00]  He was making that whole face.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah, he's definitely doing something today.  You've turned on a porn star.  Look at her.  She's definitely.  No, she says it.  No, right?  Oh, I'm.  Very, very pretty.  I can tell.  She's not faking this.  I just want to kiss it.  It's just nice, man.  All right.  Turn off the camera, Steve.  Real fast.  Go ahead.  No, I don't know.  She's in here for something else.  I don't know.  She's not here for that.  You're not little enough. 
[00:20:30]  Oh.  I like that.  Never heard that.  No, I don't believe that.  That really is a first.  I usually have to have eight-year-olds come over to tell me that.  All right.  Are we finally ready to give away the MiFi?  These guys have been waiting outside for, I don't know, six, seven hours now.  You dopey midgets don't know what you're missing.  No.  You stupid midgets out there.  She is really sexy.  Jim, let's take your hands off the porn star.  I'm just not your bras.  I'm very nice about it.  I wasn't for you.  That wasn't rude. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  We got the cherry.  Steve, are we ready?  You've got to step up now here.  You've got to take complete control.  We have five gentlemen outside ready to go now.  Okay, good.  Another five on deck.  We got the microphone.  We have a microphone over there.  It's already plugged in.  All right.  I thought the mic was in Jim's pants.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to point.  We just have to get the Cool Whip out of the fridge, and then we're ready to go.  Okay.  Nice, fresh.  And all the food that you told the listeners to come down with is...  Now it's all over the console.  It's making its way into the studio.  A lot of donuts.  People opted for the donuts.  I'm seeing some pastry cookie boxes.  There's some Pop-Tarts. 
[00:21:30]  Pop-Tart s'mores variety.  Entenmann's.  We've got beef jerky.  Beef jerky.  Nice.  Good stuff.  Steakhouse seasoning.  Good.  A lot of donuts.  Is there a producer in there anywhere?  A producer?  I don't know, because Steve said to bring food yesterday for some reason that sane people  cannot possibly understand.  See, I want super genius added to my business card, because if I didn't say that, there'd  be 150 people out there instead of, like, the 100 that showed up. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, well...  I'll make sure you're super genius, I guess.  Thank you.  Steve C., super genius.  All right, why don't we get Candy in position here?  Keith, why don't you...  Where would you like me?  Why don't you assist?  Well, that's our lesbian couch that we covered up with the card.  Oh, how hot is she?  And, Keith, why don't you move the microphone over there so...  Oh, Candy's fantastic.  ...so she can still be on mic.  You have a smoke...  Wow.  What a hiney you have.  I'll say, what a smoking body.  Wow.  I haven't gotten that view yet.  I have the worst seat in the house these days. 
[00:22:30]  I have a great seat.  I used to have the best seat at the old studio.  This one, I can only see shit from, like, the waist up.  I want to bring my friend, she wants to see.  What?  Wait, are we going balloon knot or...  Jimmy wants to...  What?  We doing balloon knot or Wells Eye?  Balloon knot.  All right.  Next five?  Next five.  The next five are making their way into the studio.  King Kong Bundy is just after the studio.  Jesus Christ, is he going to eat somebody?  Here we are.  Gentlemen.  Very good. 
[00:23:00]  Wow, these guys...  You guys have been up all night, huh?  I can tell.  Yeah.  We've been waiting out front, patiently.  Yes, patiently.  Have you boys been drinking at all?  No.  Look up.  Nah, a little bit.  Not really.  Just a little bit.  Damone.  No.  He's been hung up for three hours.  He's been hung up for three hours, you said?  All right.  Eric, why don't we mic the guys?  All right.  Who's our first thrower?  I'm Andy.  Hey, Andy.  Where are you from, bro?  I'm from Pennsylvania.  You know where I'm from, actually?  You remember that girl, Ashley, that called up and she said she was from Hazleton? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  That's my town.  Hazleton.  So I was like, what?  But, uh, yeah.  All right.  Cool.  I love it.  That's how that is.  I really lost steam.  Do you know her?  Yeah.  I don't like it.  She didn't go up.  No, she was a fake.  She's from Tennessee.  Yeah.  She's cool.  Yeah.  She's a silly goose.  Okay.  So, Andy, you ready to throw a dart or what?  Yeah, I'm ready.  Let's go.  You like our porn stars?  We've got candy and star on the light being couch.  Sure.  Sure.  Why not, right?  Do you know where you are?  Bro, or?  You've got to take a cherry and dip it in whipped cream, fella. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  He's picking out a cherry, Anthony.  He's got the whipped cream.  Are the girls ready?  We haven't talked to star in a while.  You all right, star?  He's a young, eager boy.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, star's ready.  We've got candy ready.  And should we clean?  Clean up?  Should they clean up for round two?  Oh, yeah.  They might want to dab it out with something just in case.  Oh, good idea.  Do you guys want to?  Who wants to be the official cleaner?  Not me.  They want to clean on the belt?  A big shout-out to my wife, who I love very much.  Yeah, candy won't go near it.  He's two feet away.  Yeah, they're all cleaned up, ready for this. 
[00:24:30]  The second heat.  Okay, they're getting all started up.  I would be happy to do that.  With your tongue.  Oh, yeah.  They're helping each other out, Anthony.  That's so nice.  Good friends.  That's sportsmanship, if I've ever seen them.  Dabbing.  Sopping it up.  All right, they're getting back into position.  Their balloon knots are nice and high and ready for Andy's toss.  He's got the dart and...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Horrible!  Nice throw, Bob Dole.  Jesus.  Andy waited three hours to do that.  That is a lousy throw. 
[00:25:00]  Where did it hit?  It hit the couch.  All right, I can't see from here.  Isn't it great when they screw up, they're taunted by nude women?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, what a lousy throw.  You stink.  All right.  Open anuses, just laughing at them.  Let's get to the next guy.  How you doing, man?  Hey, what's up?  I'm Dan from Long Island.  Hi, Dan.  Anything you want to promote?  Say...  I'm going to promote WeAreExtreme.com.  It's the t-shirt I gave you.  Oh, that t-shirt was cool.  Anthony, I've got to throw you one, though.  Oh, what's that?  You ran away from us this morning, so...  Yeah, I did.  I ran upstairs. 
[00:25:30]  I didn't want to deal with anybody.  You were scared of the drunken idiots, you know.  It was pretty funny, though, coming in at 5 in the morning and having all these lunatics  screaming and yelling.  WeAreExtreme.com.  Anything crazy happen out there this morning while you're waiting?  Nothing that crazy.  Well, someone wrote Little Prick on my car.  You know, that's when you weren't looking, you know.  Yeah.  I gotcha.  Should have stopped.  Are you ready?  I guess so.  Yeah?  I mean, I finally woke up, so why not?  All right, grab a cherry, dip it in the old whipped cream.  There you go. 
[00:26:00]  And the girls are ready.  They're getting back in position.  Are you guys bored yet?  Not at all.  Not at all?  Of course not.  How terrific are these guys?  I'm going to get bored with cherries being thrown into your ass.  I think we need a little more whipped cream on that cherry, sir.  I know your strategy is probably to keep it from being thrown off a little by the whipped cream,  but we need something that will show up.  Just have fun.  That's all that matters.  Although you can, if you want, you can remove the stem.  If you like the stem.  If you like the stem, using it like a dart.  All right, here he goes.  He's stepping up to the line, Anthony.  You shoot darts?  Yeah, you can tell about it. 
[00:26:30]  He's concentrating.  Oh!  Top of the cherry?  Off the back.  Some of it hit the back of our head.  How hot was that?  Yeah, it was down my back.  It really was a really nice sound.  Just right at the very top of the crack, where the crack starts.  Just to the right of that.  It went back into the left.  No, it's where it marks.  It's not where the cherry actually ended up.  The cherry's kind of sitting on her lower back now.  It's where it hits, and the initial point of contact.  That, right there, is the winning, it's in the lead so far.  As of right now, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  As of right now.  The first guy hit the fucking sofa.  In the lead.  All right, and King Kong Bundy is about to throw a cherry dart.  First one, Chip James Pegg.  I've never heard that before.  All right.  Or Gross Burger, or Butterbean.  Oh, yeah, Butterbean.  You're a cutie.  Thank you.  You do look like Butterbean.  You really do.  I love your cleaning products.  Yes.  All right.  If I get it near the hole, and the explosion's knocking in, does it count?  Caddyshack.  Oh, good.  All right.  Yeah, that was good.  Hey, is there anything you want to say or promote before you throw your cherry dart? 
[00:27:30]  Uh, I guess me.  Philbin Transport.  I'm a courier.  What do you transport?  Whatever.  Envelopes.  His body.  Look at him.  Nothing.  His van got towed off of 57th Street.  Did it?  They towed it?  No.  All right.  Also to Caddy's in position as the official judge of cherry darts.  Here we go.  Eric's got the mic.  Here we go.  And...  Oh!  Not bad.  Nice tie.  Not bad.  Just missed to the right, I see.  Very close.  Exactly.  Let me get a measurement.  Let's get a measurement. 
[00:28:00]  Kenny's going in there with the tape measure.  Kenny?  Inch and three quarters away.  An inch and three quarters.  Very good.  You are in the lead so far.  So far, you're first, sir.  Very good.  Nice.  All right.  Let's move this along a little bit.  Who's up next?  All right.  I'm Kevin.  I'm from Carmel, New York.  How old are you, Kevin?  18.  Okay, cool.  You are a lovely young thing.  You got pubic hair?  I saw you at Bananas a couple weeks ago, or a couple months ago. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, thank you for coming, Kevin.  That was fun.  All right.  All right.  Did you buy a t-shirt?  You want to promote anything?  No, I'm good.  You just want to throw your dart?  Yeah.  I just came down there because I drove my uncle down, so I figured I'd have a good one.  Who's your uncle?  Uncle Matthew.  I love it.  There he is.  Okay.  I thought you guys kind of looked familiar.  I thought that is school for the kids.  Familiar.  Look alike.  Sorry.  Okay.  All right.  The girls are ready.  Kenny, I can't see with your large form in the way.  Star, how did that last cherry dart feel, hitting your butt?  It was very nice.  I'm noticing the line is really getting pushed forward.  It's so much shorter than that.  All right.  Here he goes.  He's throwing left.  Oh.  Wow. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  He hit the armpit with a lot of anger, I must admit.  That's the hardest throw so far.  Somebody got turned down for the prom this year, didn't they?  He almost hit my boob.  Fucking bitch.  Yeah.  I don't have any points for that at all.  Relax, Randy Johnson.  My God.  I thought it hit her in the face.  No, it hit her armpit.  Yeah, armpit.  All right.  Now the uncle's going to...  What's your name, uncle?  Frank.  Hi, Frank.  Hey, Frank.  Uncle Frank.  Love your Uncle Frank. 
[00:29:30]  All right, Uncle Frank.  Uncle Frank is stepping up.  Uncle Frank's going to have to move back a little there.  The line is where the doorstop is on the wall.  Come on, Frank.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Oh.  That was close, but it ain't no inch and three quarters.  It's the larger gentleman.  So far, the large gentleman has won this round.  He went for candy, and he just missed, huh, Kenny?  Yeah.  Yes.  It's more than just.  Really?  Yeah.  He hit solid on the right cheek. 
[00:30:00]  His leg, ass cheek.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he's not in contention.  It looked like he was going right in there from my angle, but I guess not.  All right.  Well, um...  All right.  So far, we have Artie in round one, and what's your name, larger fellow?  Butterbean.  Pat.  Pat.  We got to thank the other guys for stopping by.  Pat and Artie so far.  Any final thoughts from anyone?  Everyone's cool?  Are these guys getting stuff or waiting all morning?  Yeah, we got other stuff to get.  How about some t-shirts and stickers there?  All right.  Listen.  All right.  We're going to go to round three.  I got a leak, though.  Let's go in the bathroom.  Do Pat and Artie do the thing now? 
[00:30:30]  No, no, no.  Oh, no, Kenny.  Oh, no, Kenny.  Kenny, later.  We wait until we have five semifinalists.  Right.  And then that's when we hold our final between those five.  We're going to do the third round of Cherry Darts for the My Five, the portable XM radio,  in a really quick break.  I just got to take a leak.  Okay.  Is that cool?  Go leak.  All right.  We're going to leak.  XM202.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Go. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  We're just about ready for the third round of Cherry Darts for the My Five.  Everybody wants their hands on a My Five, Anthony.  It is the gift this Christmas, isn't it?  We got lots of My Fis to give away.  Yeah.  We'll be doing something different next week.  What will that be?  Well, it's not going to be as hot as today.  I think it's the whole Rich Voss thing.  Oh, right.  Do you think that won't be as hot as today?  It gets disgusting when Rich Voss comes in with his ear and his snot. 
[00:31:30]  Look at how lovely.  Oh, cool.  All right.  We got the judge.  Oh, she's wearing one of my shirts.  We got an I Slept with Jim Norton, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.  Lousy virus.  Oh, virus?  Yeah.  Very nice.  That's funny.  Thank you.  My version was not funny at all.  No.  A T-shirt.  Another lady in the studio.  We like when the ladies show up.  Yeah.  We don't want ladies to be scared of the Opie and Anthony show.  No, we're nice.  Nervous.  You're nervous?  Yes, I am.  We don't bite.  Why?  Because. 
[00:32:00]  What's your name?  Carolyn.  Hi, Carolyn.  Hi.  And what does this shirt say officially?  I slept with Jim Norton, and all I got was this lousy virus.  Very good.  You can get those at eatabullet.com.  Thank you, Opie.  You're welcome.  A little plug.  Club Soda Kenny is back in position.  Where's Sex Bagel?  Right here.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  There's so many people in here.  I don't know.  That's right.  Oh, Wack Bag.  Stingray.  How you doing?  Shows up to everything.  I like that, though.  I'm actually showing up before work.  Really?  I'm going to rush there after this.  All right, cool.  Stingray is going to be the first contestant in the third round, Anthony. 
[00:32:30]  Hi, Stingray.  From wackbag.com.  Cool.  The girls are back in position.  We got Candy and Star are porn stars.  Let's grab a cherry.  Grab one.  Candy is the 20-year-old porn star that wants to have a...  A porn made with midgets.  With midgets.  And so far, no midgets calling.  We told her we'd find her midgets.  Isn't that disgraceful?  I'm very, very upset.  They're probably all on a tree right now making cookies.  Stingray is about to throw his cherry dart. 
[00:33:00]  Here we go.  Oh!  Small to back.  Small to back.  Right there, the lower back.  And then it rolled up her back and down her back.  Yeah, that was kind of cool.  Right into the puddle.  Right into the puddle.  All right.  All right.  I don't think that's going to hold up.  It's not bad, though.  Everyone's got a pretty much miss.  It's not bad.  He missed her whole ass open.  Everyone's got a pretty much miss.  Yeah.  All right.  Who are you?  Clark.  All right.  Anything you want to promote to say?  Nah.  Jeffrey Dahmer, haircuts.com. 
[00:33:30]  You just want to throw the dart and get the hell out of here, right?  Did you...  All right.  I think he's married to this chick.  Yeah.  That's my wife.  Oh, that's your wife?  Yeah, cool.  You want to cut off the head of a Loatian boy and paint it like a cherry and throw it  in?  That'd be nice.  All right, cool.  Okay.  Here goes Clark.  He really looks like him.  What a creep.  Oh, he went for star, Anthony, and...  He got closer.  He got the right cheek.  A little of the right cheek.  Good job.  A little high.  High into the right.  Kenny, do you think you need to measure that, or...?  Well, he's got a good whipped cream mark, so... 
[00:34:00]  All right.  You're just going to keep it there?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  And what's your wife's name?  Carolyn.  Carolyn?  Carolyn.  Hi.  Carolyn, Brian.  Carolyn.  Brian Regan will be on the show next week when we go back to normal programming.  Very psyched.  This is normal.  Yeah.  Where?  Anything you want to say?  Promote?  No.  What's a good technique?  Are they swingers?  What's a good technique?  Yeah.  People...  Some people take the stem off.  I think you're...  Yeah.  Throw it like a dart, basically.  It's kind of scary when people say, what's a good technique, because they usually get that 
[00:34:30]  luck that gets in there.  We'll see if it works for you.  Well, let's just see.  I would put my right foot forward on that line.  Put your left foot back a little.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  And now bend at the knees a little bit.  Yeah.  Wind up.  I think the leather jacket's going to get in the way, but...  That's just me.  Just aim a little bit there, and just give it a toss.  Oh!  Wow.  She aimed for her head.  Hit her shoulder.  Just missed her head.  Yeah.  All right.  She hit the shoulder.  That's the way we know.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  So far, um...  What's your name, fella?  Ricky.  Ricky?  Yes.  All right.  Young man with braces?  Yeah.  Where you from, young Rick?  From Yonkers.  Y.O.  Welcome.  Y.O., dude.  Represent.  Wearing a shirt with a picture of Ben's living room carpet.  It's got a dump on it.  It's got a load of crap on his shirt.  Holy shit.  Okay, cool.  Obviously.  All right.  It's shit with a halo.  What time did you get here this morning?  I got here at 6...  Like, not even at 5.30 this morning.  5.30?  Yes.  Just waiting online.  So much for the first 25 to show up.  The guys...  You know, there were guys out there... 
[00:35:30]  No, no.  He's a whack bagger, so he got in.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm an okay terrific guy for everybody on the board.  Oh, hi there, fella.  Okay, terrific.  Representing whackbag.com.  Very good.  All right.  Back up a little bit, sir.  Yeah.  Behind the bag there.  A little cheater.  And now give it your best shot.  Here it comes.  Here he goes.  Oh, wow.  Skimmed off the top of the bar.  Grazed my ass.  Grazed.  So Clark's still in the lead, I do believe, right?  Okay.  Now, last up.  The last up for the third heat is Doughboy from Whackbag. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, Doughboy.  Doughboy, what's up, man?  Oh, the whole crew is here.  Doughboy, you can pull this out.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to pull out.  I want to go on her back.  Good boy.  Wouldn't that be pulling out?  Yeah.  I think I totally screwed that line up.  Screwed up your...  Yeah.  Say, leave it in.  What are you doing?  Fucking her shoulder blade?  I'm fucking her armpit, yo.  Axelism, if you need to know.  Okay.  Doughboy, here we go.  The girls are in position.  Eric, could you move, please?  Yeah, Eric.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:36:30]  What happened, Ann?  What happened?  I think I saw a glancing blow off all over the bash.  Wait.  Yes.  I might have to call him on the line.  Now we have to measure.  Hold on.  You've got to give a measurement.  Wait, Keith.  I might have to call him on a foul.  He was over the line.  Oh, boy.  I might have to call him on a foul.  Oh, boy.  Wait.  You can't call him on a foul.  Get a measurement.  Get a measurement.  Candy, where did that hit you?  It's marked on the veg. 
[00:37:00]  My right vaginal lip.  Wow.  Hey.  Good sense of...  She's like a Houdini-sensitive feel.  Yeah.  All right.  Candy's the official judge.  He's a little confused.  He's measuring the mark on Star's butt on the right cheek.  Three and a half.  Three and a half inches.  Three and a half.  Candy's getting in position, so you get a good mark.  Candy's getting in there, taking his job very seriously.  And Doughboy wins with three and a quarter.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Three and a quarter. 
[00:37:30]  I'll have three and a quarter.  Very good.  Wow, that was some close competition.  So it's Artie, Doughboy, and what was the...  And the...  Pat.  And Pat.  There's a fucking larger guy named Pat.  That's an awful name.  All right.  So in the final so far is Artie, Pat, and Doughboy.  And Patso.  Artie.  Hey, Pat-ass.  Patso.  You Pat-fuck.  And Doughboy from Whackbag.com.  All right.  Those are awful.  All right.  And we're getting ready for the fourth heat. 
[00:38:00]  The girls are cleaning off their areas so that the target is nice and clean.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, sweetheart.  We finally have a...  We got some soul into the studio.  Finally a non-white contestant.  That's the second non-white contestant.  A Nubian brother.  Good.  Obviously, he's going to win this heat, so we might as well move on to the fifth heat.  You think?  He looks like Al Roker.  He ain't winning nothing.  He ain't winning nothing?  No dunking.  No dunking.  Oh, you were at the event in Long Island.  That's how few black listeners we have.  I recognize a guy from four months ago. 
[00:38:30]  I met for a second.  All right.  Wow.  These guys are really big.  Holy shit.  Girls are wiping down.  Girls are wiping down for this heat.  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  Getting the other marks off of them.  All right.  Are we just about ready for the fourth heat?  The girls have wiped each other off.  They're all wiped down very nicely.  All right.  They're getting ready to get back in position, and the fourth heat will begin in a second here,  Anthony.  Girls are back on the couch.  There they go.  And who's first? 
[00:39:00]  That's you.  Sir.  What's your name, bro?  Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Anything you want to promote?  Say.  Nothing.  Well, God, we give you guys an opportunity to do whatever you want on mic, and you do nothing.  All right.  Well, he's honest, though.  He's not plugging anything.  Anything crazy happen outside while you were waiting?  No.  Not much.  It's really cold.  Really cold.  Really cold outside, yeah.  That's about it.  Well said, Bill.  Let's cut our losses and throw the goddamn cherry.  Want to stand next to Steve and warm up?  You all right?  Okay. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Get your cherry dart.  Club soda.  I can't see.  I'm going to move.  All right.  You got it.  Bill.  Why?  Oh, yeah?  No, because look at him.  He's Bill.  Yeah.  You do look like a Bill.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I know.  Fantastic.  Hopefully no one comes in with a real bill.  Right.  Huh?  What is he saying?  Sure.  I went to school happening.  You went to school there?  John Glenn?  Yep.  John H. Glenn High School?  Yep.  Out there in Elwood?  Elwood, yep.  Very good.  What year was that?  83.  83.  You almost said 60-something?  I don't know.  All right.  Calm down, Bill. 
[00:40:00]  You're off by two decades.  How's that happen?  That's fine when he was born.  What are you, like 6'5", 6'6"?  6'5", yeah.  Wow.  What do you do for a living?  I work in computers, network tech.  Cool.  All right, Bill.  Where do I know you from?  I went to Cleveland to see you.  That's where you're in Cleveland.  That's right.  Wow.  I knew I knew you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Cool.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, yeah.  Wonderful.  All right.  I knew you said.  I went to Cleveland.  Kenny, you all right with Bill?  You ready?  Yeah, I'm just, he works in computers.  I'm trying to imagine him in a suit and tie. 
[00:40:30]  Big guy in a suit and tie.  All right.  Kenny crouched down.  The girls are in position.  All right.  Get some cream on the thing.  Oh, yeah.  You need some cream.  Star, how are you doing down there?  I know where to mark things.  You good?  Candy?  Wonderful.  Okay.  Wow, he loaded that cherry up.  Are you feeling good, ladies?  You're all right?  When's it your turn?  We'll probably later.  We're going to play for a listener.  Yeah, we're going to play for listeners as the grand finale to give away another MiFi.  Either one.  You got a choice of two.  Oh, he's trying.  Lobbing.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  The middle of the lower back, once again, Anthony.  He tried kind of a slow lob and a little too much height in it, I think.  All right.  He plopped right down on the lower back.  Oh, it rolled off.  And now it rolled off.  All right, Bill.  I don't know if that's going to be good enough.  But I don't think that'll hold up.  So let's see.  Our next contestant.  Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Hi.  Honey.  Anything you want to say?  You know, that's cool on the phone.  Yeah, it's kind of creepy.  A little small Adrian from Rocky Glasses. 
[00:41:30]  I'm going to dedicate my throat to my mother.  Oh, that's nice.  That's going to make mom proud.  That's an instant win right there.  What's wrong with your mom?  Huh?  Is there anything wrong with her?  Actually, yeah.  But I'd rather not say on the air.  And this is how you...  She's not sick, is she?  I'm going to throw her now.  Oh, boy.  Well, wait.  You got to open the can of worms.  What's...  Yeah, we're going to...  Why would you dedicate throwing a cherry dart at a porn star's a-hole to your mom? 
[00:42:00]  You've got to explain yourself.  Right.  She raised me to be a winner, so...  Got to get the cherry right in the a-hole.  All right.  As mom would say.  Yeah.  Those were her first words to me when I was born.  All right, cool.  You know, you do look like a winner.  Thanks, Ken.  All right, so he's dedicating this throw to his mom.  His mom, who has some horrible disease that he doesn't want to discuss on the show today. 
[00:42:30]  All right, here he goes.  Oh, he throws it with force.  Hits her in the left eye cheek.  That was like 90 miles an hour.  Obviously, you're a little pissed off at your mom.  Yeah, why are you so mad at mom?  Don't take it out on me.  Young man with abandonment issues.  All right.  All right.  It's the left cheek.  It's pretty close to the brown eye.  Not a bad shot on star.  Kenny, you want to get in there for the official measurement?  Okay.  All right.  Star's bending over so Kenny can get an accurate measurement. 
[00:43:00]  Get that tape measure in there.  And Kenny?  Four inches.  Four inches.  Four inches.  All right.  So far, that's the bet because Bill is about four feet.  Who's this tall guy?  John.  How tall are you?  Six nine.  Six nine.  Six nine.  Kenny, can you take him?  He's an opposite of the midget.  He's a fat shit.  Oh, come on, Kenny.  I can take you.  What do you do for a living?  You install chandeliers?  No, I'm a student.  All right.  Anything you want to promote, say? 
[00:43:30]  No, not really.  All right.  Big fan of the show.  Okay.  Grab the cherry dart and let's...  Good luck.  Just hoist it up there.  Go ahead, Goofy.  All right.  There we go.  You've got to crouch down, Kenny.  Put a lot of whipped cream on that cherry.  That's for sure.  Is he going underhand?  I think he's going underhand.  He's going for Kenny.  Oh, just short.  Taking quite a risk with that underhand throw.  A little bit on the leg, but...  A little on the leg.  Just missed the area.  Just missed the area.  All right.  All right.  So far, it's the young man who's doing it for mom.  Yep. 
[00:44:00]  Let's move it along.  Mike, right?  Right.  Okay, Mike.  Mike?  Mike's in the lead.  Hey, buddy.  What's going on?  Hello, Mike.  What's your name?  I'm Joe from Miami.  Hi, Joe.  Oh, how's it going?  How are you?  You didn't come here from Miami for this, did you?  No, no, not for this, but...  All right.  Some listeners do crazy crap like that, so I don't know.  I'm actually...  I'm from Hollywood.  Oh, hey.  All right.  It's nice over there.  Anything you want to promote, say?  No, I just want to say hi to my boys, Ed and Robert.  Okay.  Grab me.  I can't even talk.  It's okay.  Grab a cherry dart.  Let's go.  What are your friends, Ed and Robert, doing? 
[00:44:30]  Sucking cock.  Yeah.  Sucking each other's probably right now.  Your friend Robert fucking a sink?  Good call back.  Of course.  Bob Kelly, yeah.  All right.  All right.  The girls are in position.  You ladies aren't bored, are you?  Oh, no.  Not at all.  Not at all.  You're enjoying yourself?  Very interesting.  The anticipation of waiting...  We got Star and Camille at hit, so they could clench.  That tattoo is great.  And here he goes.  He's got the dart in hand.  Oh.  Jesus.  Upper back.  Upper back.  Another one in the small back.  Right shoulder blade.  Yeah.  That one carried a little higher than I think you thought was going to... 
[00:45:00]  You can see where the cherry edged it and hit Governor Connolly.  I'm supposed to believe that cherry then made a U-turn.  Remember your dying king.  And now...  Let's talk to the brother now.  Yeah.  Now our black friend...  Yeah.  One of your two black listeners of the show.  Why can't he just be our friend with the Rutgers hat on?  Rangers or Rutgers...  Rangers.  With the Rangers hat.  Exactly.  Why can't he just be our friend with the glasses?  Exactly.  Our friend who's reading challenged. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, man.  Very inappropriate.  All right.  What's your name again?  My name is Justin.  I come from Long Island.  Yeah, we've seen him around a lot.  Yeah, he was in the ULS event.  All right, Justin.  Anything you want to say?  Just go to somethingawful.com.  Something what?  Somethingawful.com.  Spell it.  It's something...  S-O-M-E-T-H-U-N.  Something awful.  Something awful. 
[00:46:00]  Yes.  Okay, he got to spell it because websites are spelled weird.  Did he spell it though?  Well, he said something awful.  It could have been S-O-M-E-T-H-U-N.  He spelled it in the box.  It could have been something.  All right.  Something, something.  Something awful.  Let's go to Babiesfather.com.  Is something spelled like white people spell it or how black people spell it?  Yeah, like white people spell it.  All right.  Somethingawful.com.  Yeah, how white people spell it.  I'd get you a cherry in a little while.  All right, let's go.  Justin, you said?  Yep.  All right, Justin.  Mike's still in the lead, right?  This is the last guy in the fourth round.  Yes. 
[00:46:30]  Fourth heat.  He's dipping his cherry in the Cool Whip.  Good luck, Justin.  He's very dainty.  He really is a delicate man.  Yeah, he doesn't seem too black to me.  I got it from a negro.  All right, here he goes.  Here's Justin.  What's his style, Anthony?  I don't know.  He's using this...  He's got a limp, whiristic style.  Yeah, he's kind of banging it.  Like the black dude from Revenge of the Nerds.  What's going on over there?  I think he's using an underhand.  He's holding it by the stem.  By the stem, out in front of him, dangling.  Yeah, this is going to just be awful.  And then I think he's going to...  All right, now he's switching his throwing style. 
[00:47:00]  It's the Clay Bertrand style.  Now he's a southpaw.  Oh!  Right in.  He just got the job.  That was a better value.  Just above the brown eye, right?  Right in.  You've got to give it to him.  He's the winner.  He is the winner.  Right above the brown eye and cutting it.  Wow.  Kobe would be so proud.  It felt right on.  He slammed it right in.  It felt right on?  Good.  Yeah, right on.  Right on star.  Right on star.  A little above, but you know.  A little above, but close enough.  That's it.  Stealing the victory from this heat. 
[00:47:30]  So far, Justin, will be in the finals.  You're in the finals, son.  Which is going to start in minutes, right after this fifth heat.  Fifth heat?  We picked too many people.  When you get a rookie like that, he just completely turned around and was looking for your comments.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, bro?  Cool, how are you?  What's happening?  All right.  Are you guys all part of one gang?  Jesus.  It's like a boxcar just emptied out.  The Latin Kings just walked in.  A boxcar just emptied out. 
[00:48:00]  What the hell?  They're terrible.  Don't you guys got lawns to mow?  Oh, wow.  Those are the Mexicans.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Those are the Mexicans.  We can't tell you.  They all came in on the same pickup truck with grass clippings in their hair.  No, they're busboys.  The restaurant's not open until lunchtime.  They were just standing out at 7-Eleven waiting for work, and one of our listeners drove  by in a pickup truck.  Oh, all right.  So who was our first contestant?  Yeah.  Belez.  Hi, Belez. 
[00:48:30]  What's up, Belez?  Anything you want to say?  I represent the sexiest state, Redding, Pennsylvania.  Nice.  Pennsylvania.  How hot was that yesterday?  Hot.  That was hot, right?  Stuck it right in a turd cutter.  You have to love that.  2-1.  2-1.  Anything...  All right.  Cherry in, cherry out.  Anything crazy happen outside while you're waiting?  I heard it was...  There's a bunch of Mexicans acting nuts out there.  I don't know.  You guys are throwing up gang signs all morning.  Gang signs.  Way to pick them, Steve, wherever you are. 
[00:49:00]  Jesus.  All right.  You're right.  I bet there's a Toyota Corolla in a parking garage somewhere.  Close by, right?  Just got towed.  They just got towed.  No, they just got towed.  Did you guys get towed?  No.  Whoever's parked out front just got towed.  No, a guy did get towed.  He had to leave.  Go away from Connecticut.  Oh, and he got towed.  All right.  We'll get your cherry.  Let's go, Velez.  All right.  The girls are getting back in position.  Just have fun.  You might want to dip it in some whipped cream there.  Oh, you have to.  You have to.  Them's the rules.  You guys all left your knives outside the studio, right? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  And their hubcaps.  The machetes?  Nothing.  I like these guys.  They're all right.  Yeah, these guys don't care.  Here comes Velez.  Hey, back up a little there, sir.  Velez.  You've got to get behind that line.  You're over the border.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Dude, are you seeing double?  Complete miss.  I think he's seeing double.  It was right between the two girls.  I'm going to have to pinch my helmet for me.  Right in the Rio Grande. 
[00:50:00]  All right, Velez.  I think you're going to get the job done.  Next.  Who's next?  John.  Hey, John.  Hi, John.  Anything you want to say?  Promote?  No, no.  I'm good.  Just hanging?  Welcome to the program.  Thanks for this.  Are you as scared of these guys as we are?  Not really.  They're kind of weird.  They're nice fellas.  Of course.  Mara puto.  What does that mean?  I don't know, but it's not good.  Just nod and laugh.  All right.  They look like the band in From Dusk Till Dawn. 
[00:50:30]  He's like, you're funny.  That's right.  What?  All right, John, you ready?  All right, hurry up before Los Lobos gets upset.  All right.  You could throw that into big pussy, little pussy, stinky pussy.  Tied pussy.  I didn't know Carlos Messia could throw cherry darts.  Oh!  He hit the cheek, though.  That might be good enough.  You don't know. 
[00:51:00]  He got the hip.  At least he hit my ass.  Oh, wait, wait.  The side of the left cheek.  Velez did really well, right?  Where did Velez hit?  He missed.  Velez was...  Oh, in between them.  Okay, I'm being the last one.  So Velez is definitely out.  Okay.  All right, so far you're in the lead, son.  All right, we got the first Chicano stepping up to the play.  Very good.  No, Velez, what national are you?  Puerto Rican.  Oh, yeah, he's Puerto Rican.  Velez is not an Irish name.  There we go.  You're right.  No, they all say they're from Puerto Rico because it's part of the United States.  For immigration purposes.  Am I supposed to introduce myself now?  Yeah, what's your name? 
[00:51:30]  Alex.  I'm Alex.  Where are you from, Alex?  Bronx.  Bronx, what's your nationality?  Parents, Puerto Rican, me, American.  All right, I like that.  We like hearing that.  All right.  We're all just Americans.  You got to watch if they're Dominican.  They probably throw really well.  No, no, no.  Not do that.  Okay, anything you want to say?  You want to...  Uh, not really.  You just want to throw the cherry at the ass.  Sure.  A Dominican wouldn't throw anything at an ass unless it was a balloon filled with heroin. 
[00:52:00]  Candy liked that one.  Candy liked that one.  All right, grab your cherry.  I love candy.  Get that cherry and some whipped cream.  Candy, you're not taking your job seriously anymore.  Yeah, I don't like that.  I am, but I don't want to block Norton's view.  Candy's a good sport.  All right, you'll run right in there with the tape measure after the toss?  Okay.  Can you guys see?  Girls, you ready for this one?  On launch.  That's fantastic.  All right.  Keep taking the line very seriously.  Oh, a nice throw, but...  Yeah, I might have to measure between the cheek and that one. 
[00:52:30]  You might have to measure there, Kenny.  Well, Kenny, what do you think?  Kenny, we need you.  Where's the mark?  Where did it hit?  I can't see from here.  It's the outside of the right thigh.  Lower right thigh?  Yeah.  Okay.  The right thigh.  All right, Kenny's doing official measurement.  D-I-E.  Thigh.  Hey, Kenny, you've got to wrap the tape measure right around the box.  I don't know.  Are we doing it in the wrap?  You have to.  You've got to push it right in there.  It's longer if you do that.  Yeah.  Well?  It's longer.  It's as the crow flies.  Is it as the crow flies, or are you doing around the... 
[00:53:00]  All right, we'll do it.  I've been doing it as the crow flies.  All right.  You've got to stay with what you've been doing.  Do it as the crow flies.  Right or wrong, that's fair.  That's true.  If you pictured it as a flat target.  Six and a half.  Six and a half.  What's the next one, Club Soda?  Eight.  Wow.  All right.  So, Velez is still...  No.  Who...  The last guy's in the lead.  John?  John.  Yeah, John's in the lead.  Okay.  John is in the lead.  What's your name, sir?  Lewis.  Hi, Lewis.  What's up?  Where you from, yo?  Long Island.  All right.  So, what nationality are you? 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  It's Hispanic or something like that.  It's not Lewis.  It's Luis.  No, not Luis.  Luis.  It's Lewis, man.  All right.  Do you want to say anything?  I hate the post office.  They really suck.  I hope all those old guys die.  How is Brentwood these days?  Brentwood's really hardcore over there.  Cool.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good luck, Lewis.  He's got his drunkies t-shirt on.  Hates the post office.  Hates the post office.  He's getting his cherry. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  Nice.  Strategically dipping it in the whipped cream.  Attaboy.  Get a good one.  All right.  Oh.  Stepping up to the line.  Let's make sure we're on the line, sir.  And then give it a little toss.  Girls are in position.  Taking his time.  Ass is up.  What is he doing?  He's like shaking off signals.  No, he was praying.  Oh.  Damn.  Not going to get the job done.  Hard to ask God for help hitting an asshole with a cherry.  That's true.  Oh, God.  That's right. 
[00:54:30]  Star, what do you think?  This one.  Huh?  We need to measure this one.  Yeah.  Oh, it hit right there.  Wait, that's where it hit?  Yeah.  It rolled up to my back.  Oh, like a little pebble.  Wade, you might be in the lead after all.  Yeah, it's close.  Luis?  Six and a half.  So what's that mean?  Oh, it's still six.  Still John.  That was close.  Oh, still John.  Okay.  That was close.  That was close.  Norton's really paying attention today.  Yeah, of course I am.  Very nice throw.  Two open anuses.  How do you not care?  He doesn't like the Mexican.  I hate Mexicans.  Do you?  Yeah, bro. 
[00:55:00]  All right, this is going to be like a gang war in the studio.  I know.  We don't hurry up with this.  What's your name, sir?  Uh, Danny.  Hi, Danny.  Danny wearing an I Stink hat.  Very nice.  Is that part of the Jim Norton collection?  No.  No?  No.  Love him.  We ought to sue, like Gene Simmons now.  Yeah.  Just sues anybody that does anything having to do with him.  Anything with Stink.  My credit's bad.  I can't get off his website.  What are you saying?  I'll just sue him.  My credit's bad.  I can't get anything off his website.  Really?  Yeah, I got a bad credit.  A bad credit.  You want stuff with his credit's bad.  Anything you want to say? 
[00:55:30]  Just want to say what's up to my job and, um, Doug, you're an asshole.  I hate you, you fuck.  Doug is an asshole, though.  Who's Doug?  We don't like Doug.  I'm a fucking assistant supervisor.  It's a fucking fag.  That's true.  All right, what do you do for a living?  Doug throws a punch like he takes the ass.  What?  I work for Honeywell.  Oh, Honeywell?  Yeah.  This pretty much sucks.  Love your thermostats.  Anthony, the girls are courtesy of Joe at BlackMirror.com.  Yeah.  Oh, a cherry came flying by my head.  Why are you throwing cherries?  He told me to.  Yeah, she can.  She asked if she could, and I said, of course. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, okay.  A hot chick wants to throw a cherry?  I was wondering if she was pissed off.  I was just wondering if you were pissed off.  That's all.  I don't care.  You can throw the TV monitors.  Yeah.  Back at me?  Yeah, whatever.  All right, here we go.  The last guy of the last heat.  The final heat before the championship.  Oh.  Yeah, you threw that a little too hard.  It's Joe, right?  John, I'm sorry.  John's in the finals.  All right.  John's in the finals.  We have our five finalists who will now compete in one last.  John, Justin, Pat, Artie.  What?  Are you kidding me? 
[00:56:30]  No, we did one, two, three, four.  We said 25.  We did 25 already.  Those guys are out.  Okay.  Oh.  We can't change the rules.  We'll get in trouble for changing the rules.  We'll run out of show.  And we're running out of show.  Yeah.  You got to give them something for coming, though.  Oh, we will.  Yeah, we'll take care, everybody.  Well, guys, thank you so much for playing Cherry Darts.  Guys, thank you.  John, stick around.  You're in the finals.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Very cool.  Thanks, guys.  We really appreciate it. 
[00:57:00]  Can I have a date with one of the porn stars?  Huh?  You got to see some hot ass.  I don't get to see that.  I don't get to see that at the porn star.  No, huh?  I see these old guys every day.  Yeah, of course.  I tell you, I'm spraying the virus on my job.  Spread the virus, my friends.  Spread the virus.  She has a nice, though.  She does have a nice, though.  All right.  No reason to take a break, right?  It's a mess already.  We'll just continue.  Sure.  Bring them in.  All right.  Here come the finalists in Cherry Darts. 
[00:57:30]  Who's this guy?  Who's that?  Oh, this is Joe.  He's Joe Galan.  Hey, Joe.  What's up, buddy?  Thank you.  This is...  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  From Black Mirror.  Yeah, Joe at BlackMirror.com.  He brought the girls in.  Here are our champions all coming in.  Our athletes coming into the studio.  Yeah, we need the Olympic music at this point.  See, that would have been good if we were actually producing the show today.  The Olympic fanfare music.  Huh?  Laying the odds.  I'm going.  I'm going with Artie.  With the Italian Villa.  Yeah, Artie. 
[00:58:00]  Pizzeria guy.  Artie's got to be the favorite coming into the finals.  Yeah, Artie, the favorite.  Coming into the finals.  If you remember, Opie, first heat, first guy steps up and just sinks a bullseye, then later  confesses that he is a dart player, plays on a dart league, and bought some cherries and  was practicing all night.  So, this guy, pretty much the favorite.  But let me ask you this.  He looks like he's anxious to go first.  Do you think that's a good strategic move?  Doesn't matter.  He don't care.  Well, I think if he gets a good throw, it kind of sets a tone. 
[00:58:30]  It kind of intimidates the other players that they then have to top what he did.  If it's a bad throw, it could work against him.  You're absolutely right, Anthony.  Opie, comment?  I was too busy staring at the naked girls.  I have no idea what you guys were saying.  All right, so we're ready.  We are.  I really was.  I have no idea.  What were you saying?  No, it doesn't matter anymore.  I was babbling.  All right, girls ready?  It's a real sporting event.  Candy and star?  Beautiful.  Yeah, this is for the Mi-Fi.  The girls are getting back in position.  The grounds crews have taken care of cleaning.  Yeah, because we have to throw after for a listener, right? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, we'll do that for another Mi-Fi.  For someone who can't make it in for another state.  Correct.  They're getting...  Well, if you want to win a Mi-Fi, you've got to call the show right now.  And I think five of us are going to represent listeners from all over the country for another Mi-Fi.  Okay, one from every state?  Yeah, definitely.  Wow, very strategic.  With the whipped cream on the cherry, he wants just the right amount there.  Let's clear his...  Wait, what's wrong?  What's the matter, Keith?  Keith.  Linda, although she didn't make the finals, was hoping she could show her ass and weasel 
[00:59:30]  her way into the finals.  Yes.  Oh, well, it'll be up to the guys.  If she shows her ass, we'll...  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  No, guys, it's...  Wow, no, no.  Oh, my God.  What?  This is competition for a Mi-Fi.  Doughboy most certainly wants to be...  Wait, wait, she has no fishnets.  Are they thigh-highs or are they stockings?  They're stockings.  Very lovely.  Linda's very hot.  5'10", 5'11", blonde.  Beautiful.  And she wants to show her ass to get in the finals.  You know, the guys don't want it. 
[01:00:00]  No, no.  The guys...  I wasn't close.  I got a bullseye.  Yeah, she did get a bullseye, too, you know?  It's up to the guys.  They're afraid that a woman's going to beat them.  That's the problem.  They're afraid that a woman's going to win the competition.  I'll give her my Mi-Fi if I win.  What if she does it naked?  The finals naked.  She won't do it naked.  What if she, uh...  What are you, her fucking agent?  No, she just said no.  Stop it?  She said no.  Yeah, we could hear her.  She won't do it naked.  No, no, no.  I won't permit it.  I don't care if she does it naked, but she said she wouldn't.  Look at him.  I'm representing her. 
[01:00:30]  No more questions.  Can we just see her ass anyway?  Yeah, I hope so.  I want to see her ass.  Anyway?  I know, I know.  Look, I was with you.  Yeah, rules are rules.  Now, no one...  Everyone wants to see her ass.  But, rules are rules.  We have our five finalists, and I think it would be, uh...  All right.  You know.  Well, it was a great idea, though.  Oh, well.  You're not asking Pat to see his ass and let him, uh...  Maybe take two shots?  I'd rather probably see that than his awful skull.  Hey!  I was just thinking because I got a bullseye made down. 
[01:01:00]  Look, I'm with you.  Let it be known I'm not a fag.  If these guys want to be fags, that's their business.  I lost.  It's not good if you don't push back.  All right.  Well, let's get the finals over with for the first MiFi, Anthony.  Sorry, Linda.  I thought the idea was great.  Girls, we must adhere to the rules.  Any final thoughts from the girls as we go into the finals?  We got Candy who wants to do midget porn.  Have we had any midget callers yet?  No.  Don't worry.  We'll take care of that on another show.  We'll get it.  We're very upset.  We'll get that done for you.  Well, the second we find a horny midget, we're calling you. 
[01:01:30]  That's right.  Don't worry about it.  Porn star?  Definitely.  Good luck, guys.  All right.  Good luck, guys.  Good luck.  That's what you want to hear from a porn star there.  Artie is getting his cherry ready.  Artie, any final thoughts?  This is it right here, buddy.  The finals for the MiFi.  He's good.  He's in the zone.  He's in the zone.  Wow.  Look at his eyes.  He's focusing.  Swing, batter, swing.  Here we go.  And...  Wow.  All right.  All right.  That's not bad.  Not bad.  It went a little high.  It went a little high.  It's the top of the crack. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Maybe about an inch down from where the crack starts.  Official measurement.  Three and three quarters.  Three and three quarters.  Inches.  Not bad.  Not a bad throw.  I think that's where he comes to beat, Anthony.  He's a little disappointed.  I understand.  What happened with that throw?  I got a little too overanxious.  You got a little too overanxious.  Yeah.  You kind of threw it a little high.  A little hard.  Okay.  Somebody keeping the stats?  What is it?  Three and three quarters.  All right.  Three and...  That's already...  3.75.  Three, three...  Three, three quarter inches.  All right.  There we go. 
[01:02:30]  Who's up?  Doughboy from...  Yeah, Doughboy, of course, from whackbag.com.  So let's go for less than three and three quarters.  Yep.  That's all you have to say.  After you're done in four.  This is it.  Okay.  He's preparing his cherry.  Girls arching very nicely, Anthony, giving the guys a really good target at this point.  Now that these guys are seasoned veterans of the game, they're taking a little  more time preparing their cherry.  Doughboy, yes, standing behind that line.  Doughboy is sizing up the target.  Lean over and...  He's going for star, Anthony.  He's going for star.  Oh!  Right cheek. 
[01:03:00]  Right cheek.  Right cheek.  Far right cheek.  Let's get a measurement.  Well, maybe not, though, Anthony.  Let's get a measurement.  He might get in the side door here.  Nope.  Club Soda Candy, official judge of cherry darts.  Uh-oh.  It's close.  Uh-oh.  What does this line mean?  Oh, Christ.  He can't even read a tape measure.  What is it?  Sixteenths.  Three and...  Nine sixteenths.  Nine sixteenths.  That's a little over three and a half. 
[01:03:30]  Three and three quarters.  Right.  No, no.  Remeasure them both.  That would be...  Was it past?  Oh, no, no, no.  Three quarters.  Thirteen sixteenths.  It's out.  So does the...  Yeah, then the other guy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I want to remeasure.  Is that an official measurement?  Yeah, I just couldn't read it.  Hey, you know what, Kenny?  What?  Doughboy wants to...  You tell Doughboy what you think of his...  He wants you to remeasure.  Remeasure?  No.  Absolutely not.  All decisions of the judges are final. 
[01:04:00]  So...  Get your dough, boy.  That is...  I understand your disappointment, but it is a game of inches and fractions of inches.  Yes.  Very sorry.  Already still in the lead with three throwers left.  Good throw.  Who's up, though?  Who's up?  Who's up?  Looks like it's...  What?  John, that's right.  I'm sorry.  John is stepping up now.  Okay.  Any final thoughts, John?  No.  Okay, this is for the MiFi.  He's got his cherry dart hand. 
[01:04:30]  Yes, he does.  He's...  Oh, wait, wait.  You're way ahead of the line there.  You've got to get behind the line.  You've got to get behind the line.  Behind the line, sir.  Behind the line.  Behind the line, Angel.  That's that thing.  Mike, the girls.  That's that.  On it, behind it.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  He's going for...  He doesn't know who he's going for.  No.  So he goes for nobody.  Wow.  He panicked.  Yeah, a little panic when it happened there.  All right.  I saw...  Oh, and then he just leaves...  Just walking out.  Dude, don't be...  It was worth it just to meet you guys.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  He's beating a choking zilch.  He's used to handling rejection. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Don't get his hopes up.  Just out.  I'm just ready.  All right, Justin.  All right, Justin, the black fella.  Yep.  Very common name for a black guy, Justin.  Well, he's as white as Earl.  He's better at golf.  All our black guys are real white.  We got white black guys.  Ready, Justin?  Justin, who are you going to go for?  He's in the zone.  He's not even listening.  He doesn't even want to.  All right.  So he's lining up.  He's aiming now.  Holding that cherry close to his eye and taking a stance. 
[01:05:30]  Oh!  Oh, my gosh.  Wow.  Wow.  Did you see what Star did when she got hit?  It's real close to the blue knot.  One and three quarters.  One and three quarters.  She clinched up and went, whoa!  Hit her right in the snatch.  So far, Justin is in the lead.  We have to say goodbye to Artie.  Bye, Artie.  Artie's out.  Artie's out.  It comes down to Patso.  Patfuck.  Patso?  Wait, I want to talk to Star. 
[01:06:00]  How did that feel, Star?  It was very nice.  It was nice, huh?  It was a nice snack.  Where did it hit?  You know, right in the vagina.  The vag, right?  Yeah.  Kind of in the whale's eye.  In the tank.  That was a good one.  It was kind of a taint shot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at Kenny.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  All right, we got Pat.  He's getting his cherry ready.  Jesus, Pat.  No, I've got to do more than that.  Yeah, you've got to put a little more.  I don't know if he has to, if he doesn't want to.  If he doesn't want to.  No, you wave the way you want to.  That's right.  If it doesn't leave a mark, you're going to be screwed.  So that's the chance you take. 
[01:06:30]  We're going to make a visual judgment if there's no mark.  Too big of a mark.  Right, and you might lose on the measurement.  Good call.  All right.  This kid's got his strategy.  All right, here he goes.  This is Pat.  This is for the MiFi.  Here it is.  So far it's Justin.  Here it is.  He misses.  It's Justin's MiFi.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy crap.  This is close.  Pat might have just pulled it out.  That might be a measure off.  Kenny?  Two inches.  So Justin wins?  Oh, wow.  The black guy wins the MiFi. 
[01:07:00]  The black guy wins by a half inch.  Great throw, Pat.  What a shock.  In the end, I'm pulling it off.  Justin?  I don't fucking believe it.  Yeah.  I didn't even expect to fucking win shit.  What do you got to say until your baby's mom is out there?  Oh, fuck them all.  Congratulations, Justin.  I'm saying the winner is a...  The winner is a...  The golfer.  You sound a little taller with a cherry in your hand. 
[01:07:30]  You know, the funniest thing, I actually pre-ordered MiFi at Circus City, but now I guess I'm going to cancel it.  Wow.  You want to thank God?  Nothing?  You're all set?  Yeah, thank the Lord.  Pat, any final thoughts for losing?  You came real close.  It really sucks.  You were like...  Wow.  That's what she said.  Half inch.  You came close.  Why are you rubbing Pat's back, Justin?  American Idol.  Yeah.  I can't believe that...  All right.  So...  Wow. 
[01:08:00]  This is incredible.  It's just amazing that the...  All right.  So we...  The only way you can say it, I don't give a shit.  It's just amazing that the...  Was anyone else surprised that the...  Oh, Jesus.  The nice gentleman won.  Won the MiFi?  Justin, congratulations.  Justin, congratulations.  Thank you for playing cherry darts.  What are you going to do now? 
[01:08:30]  I'm shoplifting at Disney World.  Okay, I'm straight.  All right, Justin.  We'll see you around, obviously.  We see all these guys around.  Of course.  Pat, we'll see you around.  Thanks for playing cherry darts.  All right.  There he goes there.  You want to take a really quick break and then we'll give out another MiFi to a listener  somewhere in the country?  Oh, we're going to...  Oh, keep the...  Keep the...  Keep the...  Keep the...  Yeah, keep the...  Because we are going to be taking shots for lucky listeners.  Are you kidding me?  Can I see that? 
[01:09:00]  What happened?  When does Schoen her ass now?  Those are the sexiest panties I've ever seen in my life.  Where'd you get those?  Wow.  Oh, show the girl.  Wee.  What the hell?  We need to get a...  Come on.  You got to show the girls.  We're all going to see.  Woo!  Nice.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Those are very sexy panties.  They're very nice.  Where'd you get those?  Um, I got them someplace up in Boston.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sexually, uh, free Boston.  Okay, Anthony.  The girl's going to clean up.  We're going to take a quick break and then five of us will throw darts at, um, Star and 
[01:09:30]  Candy for another night.  He's representing a listener from out of town.  Yeah.  We're all going to pick someone on the phone line, okay?  How exciting.  And, uh, who's going to throw?  I'm throwing.  Ann's throwing.  Norton's throwing.  We need two more.  You.  No, I'm in.  Believe me, I've been known to choke and everything, and, uh, but I was on a dart league.  Well, we've got to get, uh, like, oh, Kenny's a judge.  Ron the judge.  Sex bagel?  He's holding the mic, but he means, I mean, he's, I mean. 
[01:10:00]  He has to do it.  He wants to do it.  Yeah.  I'll throw it.  The guy in the corner.  Yeah.  Well, we need guys from the show, though.  Yeah, he can do it any time.  I mean, yeah, we'll promote.  Too bad Ben wasn't here.  He could eat one and shoot it out his ass.  So they had to give us the talk on Friday, you know, it's the free play week, very important  for you guys and the company, so maybe if you, if you could kind of keep it a little  more highbrow than usual.  And, uh, and, uh, and what we told them was, uh, yeah, we'll think about it. 
[01:10:30]  Perfect answer.  We didn't say yes or no.  Ah, we'll think about it.  Think about it.  Which means we will do the show that we know how to do.  Yeah, if something comes up, you know, we're going to do it.  So then, uh, the discussion, um, goes to the show that we don't talk about anymore.  How long have we been here?  Two months?  Two months and we have one of those already?  We already have a show that we do not talk about anymore.  Eek.  And, uh, and the big discussion was, um, you guys, uh, we don't want you getting the interns 
[01:11:00]  late anymore.  Yeah.  I can't believe someone has to have this discussion with us.  Two months in.  Two months in.  Guys, we are outraged down here in Washington.  We could not believe what we were hearing.  And as we move forward, we want to make a new rule.  You cannot get the interns late anymore on your program.  Ouch.  Why?  I guess they have a problem with that in the work environment.  Because I guess, I guess technically they're employees.  I don't know. 
[01:11:30]  Are they employees?  Why can't we get our interns late?  That's like a great fringe benefit.  Sure.  If you're, uh, you know, shooting for an internship at the Opie and Anthony show, just the possibility  that they may get you late is kind of cool, I'm thinking.  You don't get that at, uh, other places.  You don't get that at IBM?  No.  You won't.  Fill in stupid company here.  I went with IBM.  That's a good one.  Yeah?  I should have said Apple or something.  No, IBM was fine.  All the boys down at IBM are counting on us.  The Captain Hook uniform.  So, uh, you know.  I'm never going to say what happened on the show that we can't talk about anymore. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know if the intern actually got action.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  I have no idea.  I certainly don't know.  I don't know if I got any action in the other room after.  Don't know that at all.  I was looking at, uh, that couch, and, uh, an intern was in here, a girl was in here,  but I don't know what was happening.  And quite honestly, after the show, I have no idea what happened.  I don't either.  I didn't see it for myself.  So, I, it's just, uh, it's just all talk.  I had no idea what happened.  I was too busy spilling everyone's phone calls. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  Dude, we're screwed, right?  Dude, we're screwed, right?  I just flashed back to 2002.  Dude, what do you think?  Uh, oh, what do I think?  I think we're fired again.  Yeah, that, that was a phone call.  I was at the diner, and I, I called Anthony, and he did say these words, we are so fired.  Yeah.  I had to walk out of the diner, because we were sitting down, and I had to take a dump,  and I swear to God, I was so upset, I'm like, I'm gonna shit my pants at the diner, at the table. 
[01:13:00]  Just from being upset.  Just from being so annoyed in the filthy bathroom, I had to go home.  Yeah, so, Ben, could I have the Lysol, please?  Did you fart already?  No.  No, no.  I did not.  This, it's, the, the megaphone.  Oh my God, it has bad breath on it?  It smells like I was talking with my ass.  Oh!  I think it's from the onion bagel.  Like, I can't talk into it right after I eat an onion bagel.  Stop licking the megaphone.  It's awful.  Do you ever scrape your tongue with your fingernail and sniff it?  Oh! 
[01:13:30]  I try not to.  No.  All right.  So, uh, so that discussion was had.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Smells like the Don Geronimo microphone.  Doesn't smell that bad.  Who's he?  Who's he?  Someone from our past or something?  I don't know who he is.  Uh, so we had that discussion, Anthony, and they were like, please, do not get the interns  late anymore.  And little did I know, as I'm having that discussion and saying, yeah, no problem, we got it all  under control up here.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:14:00]  Our own intern was banging one of the porn stars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I guess we could discuss this on the air, because it did happen, uh, off hours.  Right.  It did happen when, after, uh, uh, all the microphones were turned off.  Yes.  And the lights were turned off in the studio, and everyone went home.  It's on, uh, his own time.  It was on his own time, and I don't think it, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't happen on the premises, right?  Didn't happen on the premises.  Didn't interfere with his job?  Um, no, not at all.  So what happened was, after the show, or near the, I guess during the last hour of the 
[01:14:30]  show, as Candy's in the studio, all hot and naked and stuff, um, she's like, oh my  God, your intern, Noah, is so cute.  So cute.  I, I want to do him.  Well, you've got to give her that.  He is a dish.  She's knowledgeable.  That kid's got a smile on him, I'm just saying.  And so I, I didn't think anything of it, and I just kinda, we went across the street,  had some breakfast, and I guess at that point you were like, uh, hooking up with her or 
[01:15:00]  whatever?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I want to, uh, I think I should take this time to thank you guys for giving me the opportunity  to work at the Opie and Anthony show.  How does the intern get to bang the porn star?  Well, she, uh, took a liking to him.  Where did the banging, uh, take place?  My place.  Uh, I live, uh, across the river.  Jersey.  Jersey.  So she went home with you and you got to bang a porn star?  Yeah, we were hanging out for most of the weekend.  Most of the weekend?  Yeah.  The whole weekend?  Yeah.  She's a good kid. 
[01:15:30]  Good kid.  We had a good time.  Dude, you banged a 20-year-old hot, I've only been in the business three months porn star  from Cleveland.  Yeah.  And, and you're taking my coffee order today?  I think I should be getting him coffee.  I look at him differently today.  He's not just the guy that gets coffee.  No.  He's the guy that bangs hot porn stars.  Banging a porn star.  Now, now.  I've never banged a hot porn star.  Have you, Anthony?  No, I can't say I ever had a porn star.  Was the pressure on knowing that she's a professional?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It took me a little bit to get, you know, into the scenario. 
[01:16:00]  Really?  Once or twice, I'd say, before, you know, you're, you're really there.  Yeah, I was happy with the, uh, the merchandise and the performance.  Seems like she's all right.  You know, she seems like she had a good time.  We talk.  I wonder if we should get her on the phone.  We got her phone number?  She sent some emails, actually, to you guys.  Thank you for, uh, the opportunity to be here and have a good time.  Opportunity to have sex with you.  Yeah.  Thanking us, uh, for being able to bang our intern.  That's so funny because she, she is.  I don't know if I could bang.  A porn star.  I don't think I could bang a porn star.  She is in porno movies. 
[01:16:30]  But the fact is, she's also a 20-year-old girl that wanted to hook up with someone she  found attractive here, uh.  Dude, she's a nympho.  You can just tell by looking at her.  Oh, yeah.  When she grabbed, uh, Norton's crotch, she just went flush in the face.  She was just, she wanted.  That was probably revulsion and hatred.  Oh, you know.  She wanted action right at that moment.  Well.  Apparently not.  Not, not that kind of action.  Not Jim Norton action.  So, did she teach you any new tricks?  Oh, it was, I mean, it was a lot of fun. 
[01:17:00]  It was definitely, like, probably the best sex I've ever had.  Wow.  Did you wear a bag?  Oh, yeah.  No, we're safe.  We're very safe.  Why?  We're a bag.  You here?  Well, no, I did actually.  I saw her paperwork.  We're now going out.  We're very safe.  She had her paperwork in her purse, actually.  So, I mean, like, I saw it.  The AIDS test paperwork?  When was it done?  Last month.  She just carries around her AIDS paperwork?  All girls in the business do.  They do.  And you got her number in your cell phone.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  I don't have paperwork.  I just carry around a picture of a girl I fucked six months ago.  Look, she's not thin. 
[01:17:30]  She looks healthy.  Oh, man.  So, it took a while to...  Yeah, get into the game.  Because, yeah, you know, there's a lot of pressure there.  There's a lot of pressure there.  Well, of course.  You got to look at some of the films that she's been in and the guys that she's with.  You're talking, you know, the baby's arm clutching an apple kind of manhood.  And then, you know, was she open, let's just say, read between the lines,  was she open to all forms of sex? 
[01:18:00]  Yes, she's experienced.  Experienced?  Did you, let's just say, was there any point in the evening where maybe you were looking at the part on the back of her head?  Well, there was a lot of fun things that went down.  I don't want to be, you know, too graphic about it.  Oh, why?  I'm just like a, I'm a nothing.  Dude.  I'm a little nothing.  She's a porn star.  Who cares?  Give us the details.  Yeah, what happened?  No, no, just pretty much, you know, just the basic straight stuff.  Did you do the old dirt road?  Dude, she's an exhibitionist, though, and I'm not, absolutely not. 
[01:18:30]  We were going shopping at one point, and she wanted to do something in the basement of, like, a furniture store.  Oh, we think the vestibule of a church is a good place to start for public sex.  Wait, you guys hung out all weekend, went shopping and all that?  A little bit.  And she wanted to have sex in public?  Like a date, I guess.  Yeah, she wanted to do some stuff in public.  It's like a movie.  It's like a movie plot.  What's going on?  Did you go shopping?  Well, look at me.  Did you go to FAO Schwartz and the two years kind of do the tap dance on the piano keyboard? 
[01:19:00]  No?  It's sort of the Christmas season, so a little Christmas shopping.  No, actually.  No?  We did not, but yeah.  Did you sing a duet?  Baby, it's cold outside.  What the hell?  Did you fall for her?  No, she's a good kid.  I like her.  She's a good girl, but I mean, like, you know.  You fell for her a little bit.  No Richard Gere jokes.  How old are you, sir?  23 next week.  23.  She's 20.  She's a kid.  Oh, okay.  Same birthday as the guy who got hit in the head with a boat, actually. 
[01:19:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  You traded birthdays?  Yeah.  What's your birthday?  We talked.  We left her a voicemail.  Maybe she'll call later today.  We'll get her side of the story, but man.  Did she have the big O?  A couple times.  Supposedly five.  But, you know, she's pierced in all sorts of places, so there's nothing to do with her.  Yeah, how did those work out for you?  I mean, like, I lost my virginity.  We do a girl with multiple piercings, so I'm okay with that.  Yeah, but, like, it's easy.  Do you think the orgasms were real?  Because, you know, she is an actress, technically.  She's a screamer.  Oh, wait.  I'm not sure if they're still there, but I'm kind of... 
[01:20:00]  Why are you taking your pants...  Oh, he's not taking his pants off.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  You got, like, scratches and black and blues on your back.  She's brutal.  Oh, she was scratching your back like that.  A little violent.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's some, uh, that's some, uh...  Yeah, so thanks a lot, you guys.  Appreciate it.  Well, that sounds like a fun time.  You're very...  Oh, Jesus.  If you want an internship with the O.P. and Anthony show...  I think I might apply for one.  Email bensparks1027 at yahoo.com.  We get our interns laid. 
[01:20:30]  What are you panicking about, Ben?  Oh, we got her?  Ah.  We're just waiting to get her on the phone here.  Oh, my God.  This is just...  There she is.  All right, hold on.  I got to do this.  Ben was panicking.  Yes.  Candy.  Yes.  What?  What the hell happened after the show?  Oh, why don't you have to know that bad?  What?  We've been talking about it.  Yeah, he just showed us the scratch marks on his back. 
[01:21:00]  They haven't healed yet.  Sorry about that.  And he said you had five orgasms.  Were they real orgasms?  Plenty more than that.  Were they real?  I said plenty more than that.  And they were all real orgasms, huh?  Of course.  Oh.  And he said that you guys wanted to have sex in public at a furniture store?  Or you did, and he said no to that.  He wouldn't let me.  What were you guys doing at a furniture store?  It was like a weird shopping around. 
[01:21:30]  They're already shopping for their apartment.  Dining room table?  We could bang on that.  So, Candy, you like Noah, huh?  Very, very much so.  Oh.  I think we got a love connection.  How's that going to work out if you're a porn star?  How isn't that going to work out?  I can come visit.  So this isn't something that's, you know, one and done?  You guys might see each other again.  Oh, we will definitely be seeing each other again.  Yeah, I hope so.  This is like a plot for a movie.  Porn star bangs intern. 
[01:22:00]  What are your feelings there, Noah?  Are you a little nervous maybe about getting attracted to her a little more?  Actually.  Did you see each other a little more?  Maybe her lifestyle?  Yeah, I thought about it.  I thought about that.  And, you know, Richard Gere jokes aside, like, no, I'm fine with that whole scenario.  You got a gerbil in your ass, huh?  Oh, I thought the other Richard Gere jokes.  Okay, I got you.  Candy, so how does he rate as far as his sexual performance?  Excellent.  And you've banged a few professionals in your time, in your short time, right?  Plenty of professionals. 
[01:22:30]  And Noah knows what he's doing, huh?  Noah is absolutely amazing.  Did you teach him anything new?  Any new tricks?  We'll get there.  We'll get there?  I have only had a few days with him.  How many different positions did you guys try?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Very straight and narrow.  Oh, for now.  I'm waiting for after the AVM.  We'll end up breaking it.  Don't worry.  What?  I said, we'll end up breaking Noah.  Don't worry.  Okay, and I guess, I don't know.  As far as, like, how he rates with other porn stars, is our boy packing or what? 
[01:23:00]  He is very, very well endowed.  Oh!  The mule update.  Wow.  I'm, like, blushing.  I can't take this.  All right, well.  You have some blood that can go to your face?  Some left in that body of yours?  Wow.  All right, well.  So it looks like you enjoyed your time in New York there, Candy. 
[01:23:30]  Very, very much so.  And you pretty much spent the whole weekend with Noah.  Yeah, so until the time I left, I was there as much as possible unless I had to work.  Unless I had to work.  Yeah, that makes you do that, too.  What kind of work did you have to do in New York?  Well, what kind of work do you think?  Wow, so wait a minute.  She was at your place, Noah, right?  And you guys are hanging out, shopping for furniture, having sex, and then all of a sudden a beeper or phone goes off, and she goes, I gotta go to work. 
[01:24:00]  I gotta go.  So you go, bye, honey.  And she leaves, and then she comes back how much later?  An hour or two.  An hour or two later.  About an hour and 20 minutes, I'm thinking.  Ten minute cab ride to and fro.  Have you made a romantic path of rose petals to the shower for her to follow?  Sometimes they just talk about football, Anthony.  The rose petals were from the front door of his apartment right to the shower.  Right to the shower.  And then, oh, but sometimes they just talk about football. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's what I heard.  It's just, you know, hanging out, having a burger.  What kind of furniture were you shopping for?  Mouthwashing a bidet?  Wow, that is something.  You know what it is?  I know what it is now.  It's absolutely risky business.  It's the movie risky business.  That's what was going on, actually.  He's in the house, hanging out with the chick.  She's still got work to do. 
[01:25:00]  Were you jamming your Tangerine Dreams greatest hits CDs?  Did you slide in on your socks, wearing only your underwear, and do a little dance?  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  A little Bob Seger in the background?  There it is.  Here comes Noah sliding in.  Yeah!  Look, Noah's dancing.  He's getting the apartment all set while she's out with some other guy.  Went to the furniture store to find something to put that big glass egg on.  Sure! 
[01:25:30]  Parents are away.  Guido the killer pimp.  Did you drive the Porsche around?  Lease.  Lease, right, okay.  Oh, very good!  So she went to work.  How many times did she go to work?  No, she left on Friday night for most of the night, and then once on Saturday.  So she came back Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon?  No, Saturday.  Well, Saturday we spent most of the day together, and she had to leave for most of the evening,  and then she came back later at night.  Actually, twice she came back, didn't you? 
[01:26:00]  Was there any, um, was there any jealousy going on in your head, knowing that, uh, you know,  none?  No.  No jealousy.  No, we're, no, no illusions here.  Yeah.  Work is work, my dear.  Absolutely.  That boy has no illusions.  God, this is a great story.  All right.  Whew.  Well, thank you, Candy.  Anything else you want to add?  What'd you do when she was gone?  Yeah, really cleaned up, I think.  Put things back in place, move the bed back to the wall.  Hanging around the house, looking at his watch.  Yeah.  Called the 1-800-AIDS hotline just to make sure everything's okay. 
[01:26:30]  Hi.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Hi, Candy.  Noah again.  I'm just leaving a message.  I don't know.  Hope everything's going good at work.  I miss you.  I miss you.  I miss you.  Can you call me on the break?  Call me back.  I'm just, I'm at the house, you know.  Just call me.  Okay, bye.  Hi, Candy.  Noah again.  I'm leaving a message. 
[01:27:00]  Boy, you've been at work for a while.  I'm just wondering if you're coming back.  Chinese tonight?  Okay, give me a call back.  I'm just a little worried about you, you know.  All right, baby.  I'll talk to you later.  Wasn't anything like that?  You weren't thinking you should call her or something?  Make sure she's okay?  Because, you know, there's some riffraff out there that, you know, 
[01:27:30]  it's almost like going out with a cop or something.  A cop has to go out on the job?  You don't know.  Maybe that's the night.  All right.  You know?  Well, thank you, Candy.  We might call you back, all right,  because this story's still developing, obviously.  That's perfectly fine, dear.  And we're still looking for midgets for your porno, okay?  Please do so.  And I will talk to all of you soon,  and have Noah call me when he gets a second.  All right.  Oh, I will.  I'll talk to you soon, Candy.  Bye, boys.  Bye, all right.  Why don't you go talk to Candy? 
[01:28:00]  Because now I'm going to do the second half of the story,  which makes it even better.  Which makes it even more brutal.  She pretty much just admitted that she was,  look, she wasn't filming a movie in New York City.  She was making some extra cash.  Making some cash.  Spending a little time with some gentlemen.  Right.  So now it's like open game.  Yeah.  No, Ben, you don't even know the half of it.  No, you have no idea.  Ben's laughing already.  He's laughing at Jimmy,  but he doesn't even know the half of it. 
[01:28:30]  This is where...  This is the portion of the show  where we prove that Jim Norton's life is truly pathetic,  just like he's been telling us for years.  Everyone thinks I exaggerate,  and people don't understand  that from head to toe, I am garbage.  This, I will be Bob Kelly  with a tear dripping down my eye for this story  because it is sad.  Anyone else notice that Norton had nothing to say to Candy?  Nothing.  Well, I didn't want to, again,  I don't C-block other guys.  Of course.  And if he's got a thing going,  it's like I'm not going to jump in 
[01:29:00]  and say something stupid through in the mood.  If you were listening to Cherry Darts on Friday,  it was obvious that...  Plus, you didn't mention it.  That's why I didn't mention it.  Yeah, I know.  Well, now it's time to mention it.  We were going to mention it anyway.  I wasn't going to let this one slide.  You shouldn't.  No effing way.  So, it was pretty obvious  that a lot of people took a liking to Candy  because she's young, she's hot,  she's, you know,  only been in porn a few months,  and she's obviously...  Willing to do anything.  She's obviously a nympho.  She took a liking to Noah.  But there's no secret 
[01:29:30]  when a girl comes in here,  Norton will kind of feel these girls out  and also feel them up.  Oh, cut it out, Hope!  And we got Candy to, you know,  mess with Norton's mule and stuff  a few times during the show.  Through the pants.  And Norton was thinking  there may be something there  because she did get all, you know,  flushed after she touched your mule.  You were thinking maybe  that I might be able  to get something going on here.  But not the way you think.  What do you mean?  I was, we were joking around  about, like, oh yeah, 
[01:30:00]  he likes to,  Norton likes to go out  and pay for girls.  And she's like, well, come on!  Like, kind of like a joke.  Right.  But I knew it wasn't a joke.  So I was under no illusions  that, like, ooh,  I think she likes me.  I never make that error.  Oh, okay, okay.  Ever.  Well, I forget we're dealing  with a professional.  Oh, yeah.  But I also know Jimmy might,  Jimmy might ask a girl,  hey, you want to go out  for a cup of coffee or something  just to maybe get to know her  a little better?  Yeah, at times, yeah, sure.  But you weren't thinking  that with her or anything?  No, I didn't get those vibes  off her.  I immediately knew, like, 
[01:30:30]  you know, like, she's like,  I'm an impover.  I never really believed it.  I know it's all about business.  At least the relation with me  was about business  and that was perfectly acceptable  as far as I was concerned.  All right.  So, she spent the weekend  with Noah, though,  and no money was exchanged there.  Of course not, no.  She spent it because  she found him attractive  and they spent the whole weekend  having sex, shopping.  Having free sex, Anthony.  Free sex.  Candy the porn star  had free sex  with our lowly intern  who's pretty much a nothing  trying to, you know, 
[01:31:00]  learn about radio  and things like that.  No offense to Noah.  Knock a man down.  No offense to Noah.  He's still a young guy  and he's, you know,  he's growing and learning  every day.  Mm-hmm.  Norton wanted to have sex  with Candy as well.  Well, why not?  And how much was it  going to cost you?  Well, I'll tell you  what happened.  Oh, boy.  I'll let you know.  I never...  Before Norton said,  I just want to make it  perfectly clear,  lowly intern Noah,  free sex...  Free sex all weekend long.  ...with hot 20-year-old 
[01:31:30]  porn star Candy.  Free sex all weekend long.  So much sex  that he's saying no  to sex in bathrooms  in public.  Right.  Scratches down his back.  He's getting so much sex.  There was a point  where he had to say  no mosh.  No.  Not in the basement  at the furniture store.  Right.  Well...  As the day was progressing,  she was indicating  that she liked Noah.  You could tell  that she liked him.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  And so I was going  to ask for her number  just to conduct  some business.  Uh-huh.  But him and her  were kind of talking  and to me that would  have been like  a C-block move.  Not that she would  have went for me  over him,  but that kind of  adds a bad vibe  if you're in the studio  and everybody's  like a vulture.  So I was like,  ah, let it go.  I'll talk to Joe later  and see if she maybe  wants to talk to me later,  but I didn't want  to make her uncomfortable  because she seemed  to have a vibe  going with Noah.  I'm not a blocker.  I hate cock-blocking guys.  Absolutely.  So I talked to Joe after.  I'm like,  hey, man,  just call Candy.  I would like to talk to her 
[01:32:30]  if she wants to.  If she doesn't tell her,  it's cool.  No one's uncomfortable,  whatever.  Just give her my number.  And so he talked to me  like hours later.  So much for not whoring,  by the way.  I know.  I'm a weak man.  Remember you were  sweating off that?  I wanted to feel it out.  So Joe calls me.  He goes, look, man,  I don't know the deal.  She said you could call her.  He's like, I really don't know  if she likes her or not.  I'm not sure.  I'm like, yeah, no problem.  He stayed out of it.  So I gave her a jingle.  You called her up.  Right after she got back  from good old New Jersey.  And I'm like...  Yeah, when did you call her 
[01:33:00]  like exactly?  What day and time was it?  It was Friday.  It was sometime.  She had just come back  into Jersey.  Obviously from having  a lot of free,  young sex.  Yeah, I'm trying to think  what was happening  while you called her.  Was she actually with...  No, no, no, no, no.  She had just had  free sex with him  and left with our intern.  She probably got the call  from Joe  knowing that I wanted  to talk to her  but probably couldn't  jot the number down  because her mouth  was all full  of young intern mule. 
[01:33:30]  Young intern mule.  Without a thought  of a buck in her head.  Not a thought  of 15 years  slaving in this  motherfucking business.  not one thought  about a social life  thrown out  to be good in comedy.  Not one thought.  Why would you think  about that  when there's abs  and a smile?  Why would you?  You might as well add 
[01:34:00]  that you were on VH1  this past weekend.  Oh, who cares?  MTV Pilots,  the Opie and Anthony show,  the Tonight Show,  does it?  None of it means nothing.  Quick scene  and Spider-Man.  You know,  it is as meaningless  as I've been telling you  for all these years.  It's drivel.  So we chat briefly  on the phone.  The only thing  Noah has going for him  is good DNA.  Good looking guy.  Very handsome guy.  And a nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  I like Noah.  You've got a great resume.  He's got good DNA.  Yes.  I have a mediocre resume  and he has great DNA. 
[01:34:30]  But it's one of many times  I've lost a good looking guy.  It's just the way it goes.  So she gave you a jingle back?  Well, no.  She actually answered  when I called.  So I'm talking to her  for a second.  I'm like,  so how you doing?  She's like,  cool.  I'm like,  yeah,  I would like to hang.  She's like,  well,  that could be arranged,  which I immediately like.  Talk business.  Business.  Yeah,  I'm not some dummy  who's like,  hey,  please,  you know,  please.  I'm 36  and she's 20.  This is what made me  want to just spit peas at her.  I'm like,  all right,  well,  let's talk about it.  And she's like,  well,  I'm working for so-and-so  and she quoted the price  and I almost threw the phone  out the window. 
[01:35:00]  She wanted a grand.  Oh,  Jesus.  That she was given the intern.  A grand.  A grand.  A grand.  That she was given the intern  for free.  Well,  no,  to be fair,  the intern.  I said,  look,  that can't happen.  Right.  And then to be fair,  she did say that she would do it  for 500,  which is quite a break.  When you think of the 23-year-old,  good-looking guy,  getting it for free.  All weekend,  by the way.  All weekend long.  Not just an hour of her time.  Not just one load from you.  Like a free play. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  It was a free play weekend.  Could you find out  how many times  Noah had sex for free  with the boy star?  I really want to rub this in today  because I'm such an ass.  Maybe add it up  in dollars and cents.  Right.  How much free sex  he did get.  Oh,  as opposed to how much  it was.  Oh,  yeah,  absolutely.  It would have run.  Lost me a pretty penny.  Oh,  and Ben.  Ben talking for the first time  in a week.  Yes,  six times.  All right.  Wow.  So even with a discounted rate,  that would have been  $3,000 
[01:36:00]  for her to put herself  through the torture  of sleeping  with awful Jim Norris.  For an hour.  That's the only...  I don't know.  Well,  it's...  Oh,  it's for an hour.  Let's not kiddies.  For an hour.  For an hour.  Well,  you know,  it's one load,  though,  usually,  right?  Well,  they call it cups  in the business.  You could have one or two cups.  I don't know how they work it.  Cups.  An hour for me,  I've never gotten off  more than one.  For me,  as soon as it's done,  beat it.  So that's why...  That's where he's doing the math.  So it would have cost him $2,000.  The only thing that annoyed me,  it wasn't the money issue.  That's fine.  It was the amount that she wanted. 
[01:36:30]  It's like,  are you fucking crazy?  You were just in here.  It's like...  You know something?  It's like...  We shared something professionally.  It's like,  how about a little discounted rate?  It's like the guy you know  with the car dealer.  If you tell me  $1,500 is discounted,  I'll vomit on my own shoes.  That's not a discount.  You think I don't know  how the business works?  You're quote high.  You don't know how much money  the guy has.  I'll do it for $500.  But you know,  you could have...  She would have said $200  for just a little bit,  not full.  I would have said,  yeah, alright. 
[01:37:00]  So it wasn't the amount  that she wanted to charge you.  That I really didn't care about.  I don't take that for a second.  It's like a businessman  that you've done business  with him before,  which is what she did here  on our show.  And then taking care of you,  like I said,  at the car dealership,  the guy goes,  hey, I could give you  a little off on this.  Absolutely.  And she was so repulsed  that she could not even  bring it down  to a normal rate.  And she couldn't even  think in business terms  of the amount of plugs  I would have given her.  I would have been Pete Plug.  All I would have talked about is...  Unfortunately,  she was horrified  by the one plug  you would have given her. 
[01:37:30]  That the other ones  didn't really matter anymore.  And as revolting as this is,  it's almost good  because I tell you,  people think I'm exaggerating  or I'm crazy.  It is exactly  the way things are.  I completely understand  and I feel for you, Jimmy.  Don't.  It's just my life.  No, I do.  I've got one of my 36.  This type of stuff  has been going on  since probably the age of 12.  Right now,  I am Bob Kelly  and you are that little midget  with the hands  flailing in front of you.  Oh, she likes me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:00]  Free for the intern.  $1,000.  Discounted to $500.  That's what...  It's just a kick  to the old fat appendix  scar stomach.  Now, I understand  how you operate sometimes  and something like this  could really throw  Jimmy for a loop.  Jimmy's an emotional guy  sometimes.  These things get to him.  How did you then deal  with this sort of rejection  for the rest of your weekend?  Well, I handled it pretty well  considering that night 
[01:38:30]  I finally called  one of my regulars.  I did break down.  You did break down.  Broke down.  I told you I'd be honest  when I did,  if I did.  So how many days  did you last?  Maybe a week.  A week.  Oh, yeah.  I think it was last Monday, right?  About a week.  You know what the good thing is, though?  You did save yourself some cash.  I saved myself a lot of cash.  It's not like if you fall off the wagon  and go to a whore  that you then have to pay  the whores that you would have  slept with.  You know, that money  is money in the bank.  And the girl I wound up  hooking up with  is a girl I've hooked up  with many times.  She might be,  she's definitely in the top three. 
[01:39:00]  She might be the best I've ever.  So this one,  it was fine.  Yeah.  If I could see her  just like once in a while  I'd be totally cool with it.  It's my obsession.  But then the next night  I'm at the Comedy Cellar  and who comes down  but my friend Dennis Hoff  who owns the Bunny Ranch.  He's a good buddy of mine.  That's a good buddy to have.  He's been inviting me out  for a year.  I haven't been able to go.  We're going to do a contest with him.  And he goes,  hey man,  we hang out for a while.  I'm going to drop him off  at his hotel.  And he goes,  hey man,  I know this real cheap place.  Let me treat you.  Now who can say no to a treat?  A treat?  What am I,  insulting? 
[01:39:30]  No.  So we go.  I didn't like the vibe  of this place though.  It was upstairs.  It was like three guys  that could have been  Latin kings or Mexican mafia guys  just sitting up there.  But I wind up going  into the room  with some southern girl,  Dennis Pays,  and she performs  rather toothy  oral treats on me.  But I tipped her 50  to take the bag off.  And she drooled  into my ass crack  like that little  shorthanded nothing  playing harmonica.  That's what it was like.  That little midget,  whoo,  those little arms.  She should have been  playing harmonica  over my balls.  That's how it would have been. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah,  that's what it looked like.  Oh man.  And the only part  with this girl  I didn't like  was I went to kiss her shoulder  and it smelled  like somebody's bad breath.  Like obviously  some dirtbag  had been in there  licking her shoulders.  Apparently I'm not  Ralph Romantic.  I thought that was  my original idea.  That's unbelievable.  Some mess had been  there before you.  Oh yeah.  I had rejection  all weekend.  I'll tell you more.  I don't know  when we're going to break.  I have to urinate  very badly.  But I had more rejection.  Did you have  professional rejection  also or something?  You said that. 
[01:40:30]  Well, yeah.  Yeah, we'll go.  I want to get  to this thing first.  I thought he was upset  at the Billy Crystal  thing you went to.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, stuff like that.  There's all kinds  of devastation  in his life this weekend.  I feel bad for Jimmy.  We do want to talk  about that,  but I want to play  the phone call  from Jim's mom,  everybody.  Oh yeah.  Do I have to do this now?  Can I pee?  I wish Kiss would come in  to hold you  after this weekend.  I really could use it  right now.  It's not even been  a bad on the outside weekend.  You look at it  and you go,  so what?  Your life is good? 
[01:41:00]  My life is good.  But it's just  these things are  confirmations  of what I already know.  Do you understand  what I mean?  It's almost like  if you think  you're the werewolf.  No, you're not a werewolf.  You're a good person.  And then you wake up  with like blood  under your fingernails  and a little fur  on your pillow.  It's just,  it's not devastating  in itself,  but you know  you're a werewolf.  You just know  you're a werewolf.  For me,  it's the same thing  except I'm shit.  You start feeling  good about yourself,  where you are in life,  your career,  everything that's going  on for yourself. 
[01:41:30]  and then  something happens  where you just  once again  you go,  ah, there.  See?  I knew it.  Jimmy Robinson  had a point.  Oh.  With his little cape.  Him and Helen  were absolutely right.  I hate that kid.  I hate him.  I hate him.  Alright,  we can do part two  after the break.  Yeah, I gotta whiz bad.  Let him whiz.  We have a phone call  from Jim's mom.  Mm-hmm.  And, um,  honestly,  I haven't laughed this hard  and I couldn't tell you.  Oh, no.  I, uh,  I listened to the first 
[01:42:00]  ten seconds  of Jim Norton's mom's  phone call to Jim.  A concerned parent.  I,  I had to stop  the tape  and I had to laugh  for about ten straight minutes.  Nice,  wonderful lady.  A lot like my mother,  the way she talks  to her son  about things.  Very loving.  Very concerned,  loving.  And then, you know,  your son is Jimmy  or your son is the guy  that made a couple  have sex in a church.  Yeah.  It's just those,  those instances  where your mom  can just remain 
[01:42:30]  so sweet  trying to guide you  and you're just  a piece of crap.  Well, as a parent,  how do you acknowledge  to yourself  that you did your best  and the thing  that you,  you sweated  for your whole life  still likes to lie  on the floor  with bags  and have his chest  shit on?  How do you accept  that as a rational,  loving parent?  You don't.  You put it in your head  and you,  you try to twist it  into something else.  That's got to be  a real downer.  Your mom left a message  on your machine 
[01:43:00]  and she's just casually  talking about your whoring.  It's just amazing.  That a mother  has to do that.  That a mother  has to do that.  And it's the same tone,  like,  I'm worried about you,  you know,  have you been studying  for the SATs?  Are you eating enough?  Are you eating enough sleep?  Are you taking your vitamins?  It's that same tone,  but she's talking  about whoring  with her son.  It's unbelievable.  The only reason  we're not playing it here  is because,  like Jim said,  I have to take a leak  like you won't believe it.  Let's go together. 
[01:43:30]  Here's Opie and Anthony  when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you,  what what?  The worst  of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Getting back  to the subject at hand,  this is the funny part.  Ben comes running  in the studio.  After that last break,  the first email  he gets  is from a guy  named Ricky.  It just says,  hello, Ben,  I attached my resume  with the email.  Thank you very much.  And, of course,  the subject line  says internship.  Yeah.  He wants to be an intern.  Well, 
[01:44:00]  everyone wants to be  an intern  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Now that they know  we get you laid.  Yeah, but,  you know,  with hot young  porn stars  from Cleveland,  there's plenty of interns  around here  that didn't  go home with candy.  Right.  You know,  just because you're  an intern  doesn't make a difference.  I mean,  you know,  you have to,  she was the one  that was attracted to him.  She sure was.  Yeah.  Let's just say  Noah's not the first intern  that got some action  because of this radio show.  No, of course not.  That's all I'm saying.  but, you know,  there's a whole room 
[01:44:30]  full of guys in there.  A whole room full  of eager guys  just waiting for their  chance at the porn star.  Yeah.  Half a thousand.  Half a thousand.  And Norton,  you know,  to bang the same  porn star  that the intern  did for free  would have cost  the gym  at a reduced rate  $500 an hour.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  So the whoring  is back on.  Nah,  I'm going to try  to stop that.  All kidding aside,  Norton is trying  to give up whoring.  Mm-hmm.  Spends a lot of money  on it.  Right. 
[01:45:00]  So I want to buy  an apartment  just because I'm sick  of paying rent.  Sometimes you've got to buy.  You know,  it's like a mortgage.  I've got to get a mortgage.  And I'm okay,  but I don't want  to keep wasting money.  Mm-hmm.  So you lasted  about a week  this time around.  That's not bad.  That's a start.  Yeah, I suppose so.  Because I know  you're pretty much  doing it every night, right?  Yeah.  I was on Craigslist  last night.  So I didn't sleep.  I slept till 3 o'clock  yesterday afternoon,  so I did what I normally  do on Sunday nights,  which is just stay up.  And I'm online,  and I'm actually writing  on my stupid blog finally,  and I just, you know,  I'm like,  I can't go to bed, so. 
[01:45:30]  All right,  so it didn't work out  with candy, obviously.  So then you had to  get one anyway,  and she was pretty awful.  I got two, yeah.  No, no, she was great.  The one I got was great.  Oh, you got two of them?  My regular was fantastic.  The one Dennis bought me,  she was nice,  but again,  she got like a nice drool hummer.  A little toothy  for my taste,  but she couldn't even fake  that she was enjoying it.  She's so depressed  to be there from the South.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I really was bummed out  with her bad breath  on her shoulder  from some awful drunk  who was licking her shoulder,  probably whispering, 
[01:46:00]  Mommy, in her ear.  Oh, God.  Although, let me be honest,  if I knew this girl  was going to run  right back to Noah's place,  I would have spent the $500.  I absolutely would have  put a batch in her hair.  Oh.  Just as a fine  how do you do?  Oh, I would have sent her back  with like Statue of Liberty hair.  Is there an awkwardness  between you and the intern now?  Not at all.  Not at all?  No.  Between guys like that,  never.  Okay.  Absolutely not.  So, yeah, the whoring thing.  I thought he was gay, actually.  Yeah, we all thought that.  We all thought he was gay.  I'm glad to know he's not. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, wow, there was that  whole thing going on.  We forgot to bring that up  when Candy goes,  you know,  wow, that Noah's a cute intern.  We're all kind of,  no offense, Noah,  but we're all kind of laughing  like, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  But that's the whole guy response  to a good-looking guy  being around.  Yeah.  They go,  oh, you must be gay.  Then we kind of,  not that it matters,  we kind of thought  maybe you were...  Really?  No problems here, guys.  There are some rumors.  Breakout rent, boys.  Let's hold chapters.  Throw them at me. 
[01:47:00]  Feeling very confident today.  Cocky, if you will.  All right, well,  we learned a little something  about you.  Thanks.  Not that it matters,  but we were thinking  maybe out of all the interns  that you might have been the one.  I'm sure one of them was.  You're sure one of them, man.  Look at the girl  looking at each other.  Oh, man, shaking their heads.  I always hope  the best-looking one is gay.  That's the one you root for.  I don't care how much  pussy Nathaniel tries to get.  Take it out of the mix.  That's six-foot-eight,  young Frankenstein-looking psychopath.  No one cares about him. 
[01:47:30]  Jeez.  Just lumbering in there  with like a checkered shirt.  Actually, it's down  in Nathaniel and Derek  because we know  Danny's not either.  I'm just saying.  We just know.  All right.  Well, I want to see  Nathaniel and Derek  take out their mules  and do a little  man-to-man docking.  And see who enjoys it  that much more?  Yeah, just see who  gets a rod first.  That one would be  guilty as charged.  If we didn't have  the new rule on the show  where we can't get 
[01:48:00]  the interns laid,  you know,  we would figure  something out.  Who are we kidding?  We're not listening  to the gang in Washington.  New rule.  All right, so,  yeah, the whoring  has become a subject  on this show  with Norton  because he really  wants to stop.  And I guess  your mom and dad  listen to the program  every day?  I knew that would  be a mistake, too.  I knew it.  Why?  They listened to the show  when it was for free,  didn't they?  Yeah, I know, I know.  I just knew it, though.  Like, I knew it.  Yeah.  You can't let your  parents listen.  You know what I mean,  it's just sex I've lost  from regular girls  because of what I talk  about on the air 
[01:48:30]  and what I write  on the computer.  I mean, it's just  there's no girl  wants to date me  after hearing this.  How can they?  Well, your mom's  very concerned  and she left a little  message on your machine.  Yeah.  I don't know  if I'll be able  to play it  all the way through.  Yeah.  It's just a sweet mother  concerned about her son.  All right, here's the tape.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's Mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know  this is a little awkward,  but everyone's fine here,  but we heard the radio show. 
[01:49:00]  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking  about giving up,  you know,  the ladies of the evening.  The ladies of the evening.  This is where I  stopped the tape earlier.  I'm going to lose it again.  Because it's your mom.  You know,  she doesn't want to say  whores or hookers  or ladies of the evening.  Ladies of the evening.  Like she read that  in one of her novels,  you know.  One of those romantic novels  where they make  everything all nice.  I know you're trying 
[01:49:30]  to give up partaking  in the world's  oldest profession.  Is there any guilt  on your part  about what your parents  have to think?  Well, I feel bad  that I'm so honest.  But no,  I have no guilt.  I love my parents.  I get a little great  with my parents.  No, no.  I've hung out  with Jimmy's parents.  They are the nicest,  the nicest people  you'll ever meet.  I know,  but the fact that  they even have to make  phone calls like this.  Yeah, I do feel a little bad.  Not only that,  but my mom has to look at  her librarian friends. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  She's a librarian.  She just retired.  She's a librarian.  A librarian.  Make eye contact.  Oh, your son.  Toilet chest.  I've got to start  this over again.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is  a little awkward,  but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about  giving up, you know,  ladies of the evening,  which is a wonderful thing. 
[01:50:30]  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says  replace something  with something.  Dr. Phil?  How does Dr. Phil  get into this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because she's a mom.  She watches Dr. Phil.  She picks up some tidbits  of psychiatry  and decides  she's going to help her boy.  I have to know  what Dr. Phil says  about weak-chinned men  with fat tits  and prostitute habits.  What does Dr. Phil  say about that?  What would Dr. Phil  say there?  Mom.  She gets her advice 
[01:51:00]  from Dr. Phil  and she's going to  pass it along  to her little son.  Little Jimmy.  Get off those  ladies of the night.  It's a good thing.  Keeping it positive.  Jimmy Robinson  and Helen say  that if you want  to replace something...  God, am I an ass?  If you want to replace  Monster Rain...  Which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always  says replace something  with something.  So I was thinking,  you know,  you have that nice gym  downstairs.  And, you know,  just for like 20 minutes 
[01:51:30]  to half an hour  and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also,  there's gyms in New York  you could go.  Aww.  Aww,  she's trying to kill  two birds  with one stone here,  isn't she?  Yep.  Aww.  There's gyms in New York,  a nice gym you have  downstairs.  Nice gym downstairs.  Instead of banging  a hooker for 20 minutes,  why don't you jump  on the treadmill?  Anything could have  been downstairs.  Zarkawi's beheading  equipment.  You could go down  there, 
[01:52:00]  just lop off the head  of an imperialist.  Just, you know,  replace it with something.  Yes.  Oh, man.  I'm going to be laughing  in my sleep tonight.  Dr. Phil.  You could go,  you could exercise,  and you would feel  a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight,  you'd tone up,  and you relieve,  you know,  tension and stuff,  and you'd be meeting  other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought  it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering. 
[01:52:30]  I know.  I just,  I'm thinking of you.  Nobody.  You could work out,  tone up.  I wouldn't have to be  embarrassed to be seen  with you.  Maybe you could not  look like Philip Seymour  Hoffman in Boogie Nights  when you wear a half shirt.  She's telling me  to tone up.  Let's translate that.  Maybe if you got  on the gym,  Noel wouldn't have  gotten a fucker for free,  fat tits.  That's what she's saying.  Maybe if you had  a little stick-to-itiveness,  you wouldn't have  to cough up  a thousand 
[01:53:00]  or five hundred.  Get off the hooker,  get on a Bowflex,  Mom.  And she said  you can get rid  of some energy,  which I know  she's saying,  that energy I have  that goes into bad things  can be used  for working out.  Lifting a barbell.  Tone up a little bit.  Lift dumbbells,  don't fuck them.  That's what Mom 
[01:53:30]  trying to say.  Pick up weights.  Don't lose it  because you have AIDS.  I'm drooling.  Oh my God.  Holy S.  Oh my God.  Try the clean and snatch.  Not the dirty snatch.  Do some rowing,  not hoeing. 
[01:54:00]  God,  if I knew more  gym equipment,  I could make this  a bit longer.  See?  What a lady fat nothing.  You've got to get me a gym.  Yeah,  fit a barbell.  This bit doesn't need  to be longer.  It is what it is.  Be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought  it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just,  I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling. 
[01:54:30]  So,  don't get offended  or think I'm strange,  but I am a mother  and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the,  you know,  the health thing.  It would help,  it would help you,  sweetheart.  Well,  anyway,  that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway,  I love you  and I feel I can  interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway,  we're looking forward  to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway,  don't be mad at me,  okay, sweetie? 
[01:55:00]  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  Everything's falling into place  except for,  you know,  your penis  and that candy girl.  But everything else  is falling into place.  Your tits are falling  onto your stomach.  Your ass is falling  onto your thighs.  Don't worry about candies.  After all,  she is a whore.  So what,  that Noah's got a better smile  and better abs?  You can always go to the gym  and tone up.  I wonder what Dr. Phil says  about me eating a bullet. 
[01:55:30]  No!  Oh, Jimmy.  I have such nice,  normal parents.  They're unbelievable.  They're just nice,  normal people.  They just want to spend time  with Jimmy  and Jimmy blows them off.  I don't blow them off.  I just, you know,  I lived at home  until I was 30.  I feel bad.  I'm a bad son.  Hi, Jimmy.  Yeah, I love you.  Hi, it's Arbond Dwyer.  Let me just take that with you.  That's what I did. 
[01:56:00]  I felt a little bad  because I couldn't get the whore.  What in the mouth?  Works fine.  Hi, Jimmy.  Kurt Cobain.  That'll take care of everything.  That is really awful  and very uncomfortable.  I'm just devoid of worth.  It's nice, though,  your mommy calls you like that 
[01:56:30]  to talk about whoring.  My parents always give me  nice messages, you know?  How are you?  It was just when she said  ladies of the evening  and then Dr. Phil  and tone up.  Tone up.  You could tone up.  Yeah, read between the lines.  She's almost saying, like,  look, I understand  why you have to go to whores.  Do a sit-up.  She's basically  taking the side  of women in general.  Yeah.  Saying you might want  to go to the gym  and tone up.  That, you read between the lines.  She's being nice  because it's your mom  and she loves you.  Yes.  But really what is being said there 
[01:57:00]  is, look,  you disgusting pervert.  Why don't you go to the gym?  Get your mind off the whores  for a second  and pick up something  besides a sandwich.  That's what mom is saying,  but she says it in that nice mom way.  In a mom way.  Dr. Phil,  you know,  get rid of something,  replace something,  which is, you know,  what I want to do.  Jimmy,  I've been listening  to Dr. Phil  and he says  when you get rid of something  to get something.  So,  could you not be my son anymore 
[01:57:30]  and Noah will be?  Is that at all possible?  I would like to get rid of you  and have a nice,  attractive son  that can get the whore  for free.  Noah coughs  and he works out  his ab muscles.  It really is depressing.  It's just coughing  into a six pack.  He probably stretches.  He has that little V  going down.  You know the little V  that goes under the abs  over the pubis? 
[01:58:00]  So that way  all the whores for free  can say,  hey,  where is it?  Just follow the V.  Oh, Noah,  I should be paying you.  Tee-hee-hee.  Blah-blah-blah.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's that Jimmy Norton  on the phone.  Two grand, fatso.  Yeah, no, he's gone.  He shan't be calling back.  Why shouldn't I charge him?  He has a string of paloponies.  God, am I worthless.  Oh, candy. 
[01:58:30]  XM-202.  Hey, do we have  an update from Noah?  Are you still banging candy?  The porn star?  Oh, she's probably back in Cleveland.  I'm hearing that there may be an update,  and this is kind of a soap opera,  the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess if you're just tuning in  the program,  well, God,  we're seeing the numbers.  A lot of people tuning in  every day, Anthony.  So maybe a lot of people  don't know that...  Wow.  Are these the latest pictures  from candy?  Yeah, she's got some new sites up 
[01:59:00]  at LADirectModels.com.  Wow.  I'm giving her a plug.  You are giving her a plug,  aren't you?  I'm allowed.  Not the first time.  You banged this.  Yeah.  For free.  Very nice.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Very impressive.  This is the same girl  that was in the studio?  Let's take a look.  Let's take a little look.  Let's see.  I don't think she photographs  as well as she looks in person.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Wow.  Yeah, that's...  How old is that?  Oh, hello.  There's a fine how do you do.  Well, we saw that how do you do  during carry darts.  How old is she again?  20? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, 20.  Candy is a porn star.  She's new to the business  and only been doing it  a short period of time.  And she's from Cleveland  and she came and did some stuff  for the radio show.  That's lovely.  Look what you would have  had to pay for, Jimmy.  Nope.  I ain't looking.  Oh, he's not looking.  And Jimmy took a liking to her.  She's a very lovely girl.  We don't really dig  the porn stars usually.  Yeah.  But this one is fresh off the boat.  We like them when they're  brand new porn stars.  And she looks pretty good.  She looks really good, actually.  And Jim was... 
[02:00:00]  I think it's safe to say  you were hoping you could  spend some time with her.  You went for the freebie?  No, I never went for the freebie.  No.  We had her grabbing  your junk on the air.  But I even told you  that that was like...  I'm like, no.  I'm not deluded as to what that is.  But she grabbed your mule  and she turned kind of red.  She was really into it.  I think you were hoping  that perhaps after the show  you could say,  hey, you want to grab  a cup of coffee or something?  No, I kind of knew...  No, I'll tell you why  because when she first came in  the story got brought up  about how I like to spend  a lot of money,  she's like, what about me?  And I knew immediately  that was the place. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, that was just about the past.  No, I was never deluded about that.  That's fine.  All right.  I just didn't like the price  she quoted me.  Yeah, that was a little steep.  A little steep.  A little steep.  A little steep.  A little steep.  A little steep.  A little steep.  Yeah, Jim would have to spend,  what, $1,000 to sleep  with Candy the porn star.  Oh, gee.  Near the end of the show,  Candy decided that Noah,  our intern here,  was really cute.  She had a thing for Noah,  the intern.  Yes.  No offense, Noah,  but that's your title,  the intern.  He's a huge comic  that was on Jay Leno. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Tonight Show.  He was on the Tonight Show.  And you're an intern,  technically, okay?  And Jim thought, you know,  he could spend some time  with Candy and...  Spend some money on Candy.  Spend some money on Candy  and it was going to cost you $1,000  and then she said  she cut you a price of $500, right?  Which I thought  was very reasonable.  And as you're trying  to negotiate this,  Noah, the intern's  banging her for free.  Yeah, that just shows you.  But it does go to prove  being funny is worthless  on every level.  It really is. 
[02:01:30]  I'm telling you,  it is of no value.  You get girls  that want to be your friend.  Exactly.  That's what you get  by being funny.  A bunch of fatzos  that like me.  Yeah.  Make me laugh.  Bag hags  that kind of  also like funny guys.  That's pretty much it.  So Noah brought Candy  back to Hoboken  and bagged her  all weekend long.  However, had I known  that, I actually would have  spent the $500  if I knew she was  going right back after  just for a hummer  and I would have  left some honor  just as...  Leave a little...  Yeah.  Leave a little Jimmy honor  for the trip back. 
[02:02:00]  We can dream.  Maybe someday.  You know, perhaps,  and this isn't  out of the question,  perhaps she was  doing this  to get free  kind of room  while she worked  in New York  because she was  going to jobs  when she was  staying with you.  Yeah, that was  the best part about it.  In between banging Noah,  she was going on  real jobs.  Yeah, you know,  the cell phone rings.  She goes,  oh, I gotta go.  She's gone for an hour,  you know, a couple hours.  She comes back.  She was taking care  of another guy  and then she comes  back to Noah's house.  How many times 
[02:02:30]  did you bang her  in the weekend?  Yeah, like six.  But she had to  cross the river  every time  and she came back  like two or three times  so the theory  doesn't really  hold up there.  No?  No, she had a hotel  room and everything  so it's kind of  a hassle to cross the river.  She did have a hotel room?  Yeah, she told us  she had a hotel room.  She just liked Noah.  I wanted to clear it out.  Why wouldn't she?  I absolutely...  What's so hard to believe?  I'll tell you what's so hard...  I look like you walked  off the set of Smallville.  But she's a porn star.  Yeah?  I have this...  But she's a young porn star, 
[02:03:00]  not quite jaded.  I just don't think  porn stars in general  like people in that way.  I don't think she's been  abused enough.  Like she knows how  to separate the sex.  Like she was really  into the sex with Noah  and then she was doing  the sex on the side  to make some extra cash.  And that was a little  bizarre to me.  Not jaded enough yet.  Right.  So are you guys  keeping in touch today?  Yeah, we keep in touch.  She sends me  little text messages  that are just nasty.  Pretty much amounts  of phone sex.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  My jacket.  Top...  Yeah, this pocket. 
[02:03:30]  What does she say  on the phone?  You know, you'll...  I'm not nervous about it.  I'll show it to you.  They're nasty.  They're just brutal.  Do you like it, though?  Yeah.  I got a little cold, though,  over the week.  That's why I was out  on Wednesday.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's the...  Oh, boy.  Oh, oh.  You sure it's cold?  No, if that's the only thing  I walk away from last weekend,  I think I win.  That little thing  where you're standing  over the toilet  and your dick sneezes  green stuff?  That's next.  It always starts  with a little cold.  Oh, a little...  Oh, just a little sniffle.  My throat's a little scratchy. 
[02:04:00]  Tell me you weren't thinking,  like, uh-oh.  I must be coming down  with something.  Yeah.  You know...  What's the incubation period?  No, you stand in front  of the mirror  for a couple hours  examining every little bump,  and you're like...  See?  Is that...  That's not what I think  it is, is it?  It starts with a little cold,  and then you're wondering,  well, what was this girl  about after all?  She's getting tested  this week.  And she's gonna...  Do some work.  ...give you the news?  Oh, jeez.  All right.  Are you a little nervous?  No, no, no.  Are you a little nervous  about this, Noah? 
[02:04:30]  I mean, her test is coming in,  and...  Wait.  That's not age.  There's no age.  It wouldn't be that fast.  It doesn't work that fast.  Wait.  No.  Can you tell?  Does it take, like,  a while to show up?  It takes about 10 years.  Well, no.  I mean, like,  to show up in a test  if you do a blood...  The HIV thing,  not the HIV thing.  Look at it.  He's asking questions.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  What stupid thing  did you do,  assuming it was okay?  Oral sex?  Yeah, well,  some of that.  You had some oral, right?  Yeah.  And without a condom.  Without a dental dam.  Dental dam.  Those are romantic.  Oh, that's horrible.  Who the hell has...  Dental dam. 
[02:05:00]  Who the hell  has ever used one of those?  No one.  Get in there  and mix it up.  Right.  It's just a little  spin and fluid.  All right,  we're looking at  Noah's phone  for the text messages  from Candy the porn star  from Cleveland.  That was the last one.  Uh-oh.  Good one.  Yeah.  Starting from this one,  15 to all these  that are locked.  All the 15 and...  I'm saving them.  I'm awful.  Yeah.  No, you should save them.  Are you kidding me?  Pretty romantic.  Go to the thanks now. 
[02:05:30]  What do you do?  Hit okay?  Yeah, that's one and up.  Thanks now.  The rest of my day  will be filled  with thoughts of you  wet and soapy.  No, that's...  Never mind.  Water running down  your body,  dripping onto  so many places  I'd like to be touching.  Damn you.  Wait, did you shower  in front of her  or something?  I think it came up  in conversation.  All right, how do I go to the...  Do I get that back out  and go to the next spot?  Go to 14?  Bill O'Reilly  like to attack you  with a loofah.  A loofah in the shower.  I want to read all these 
[02:06:00]  because it'll drive  Norton nuts.  No, it won't.  Yes, it will.  Who are you kidding?  Your dick filling my mouth.  I start slowly  then wrap my lips a bit.  Tighter sucking water  allowing you to slide  into my mouth deep  and quickly  over and over again.  Are you reading something  or just talking to Noah?  He's still searching the text.  Oh, you want me to read?  Okay.  You tend slightly  and arch your back  grabbing my wet hair  forcing me.  Bill O'Reilly 
[02:06:30]  forcing yourself  deeper down my throat.  You moan loudly  that you want  to come in my mouth.  That's nice.  All right.  That's nice.  And it continues.  You're a bit weak,  shaky even,  but I don't stop.  I suck vigorously.  You scream lightly  letting yourself explode  in my mouth.  I swallow sucking  greedily  wanting more. 
[02:07:00]  Opie?  Please isolate some of this.  Please.  It is the...  I just want to remind you  we are in the  free play week.  Yeah, but they said  just no live sex acts.  I want you inside of me  thrusting deep  making me so moist  you slid in  with such ease.  My warm wet...  This wasn't such a good idea.  Graphic depictions.  Oh, really?  I would think.  constricting you  to stay inside,  taunting you 
[02:07:30]  to F me harder.  I think we found  our cliffhanger.  If you want to hear  the rest of  Noah the Intern's  text messages,  make sure you sign up  for the channel  and continue listening  on Monday.  When it culminates  in some sticky mess.  There's another ten.  I love the way  you make me scream.  We can say that, right?  That can mean anything.  All caps.  Anything?  Are there any messages  about balloon,  not action?  All right, wait.  Something's going on here  because now she just writes,  not too shabby,  you're getting better at this.  So you're writing back to her.  I gave it a shot.  I'm awful at that sort of thing. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, you tried talking dirty  over the text message to her.  And she's being polite here.  I think I erased it.  I'm not even giving you that thought.  She says, not too shabby,  you're getting better at this.  What did you say?  It was a worthless shot.  I think it was something  about oral sex.  I gave it a try.  You spill my coffee  and I pour coffee  on your tits.  No?  I've never been good  at that whole thing.  Come on, what did you say?  Cyber thing.  It was something about  like a leaky member  in places that they just belong.  That's good.  We're cleaning it up  for you people. 
[02:08:30]  No, what did you say?  It's cool.  I'll search for it.  It's probably in my outbox.  I'm actually quite worked up now.  A bit wet, to say the least.  And no panties  is making public masturbation possible.  Hmm.  All right.  My fingers are inside my...  All right.  Well, hey.  Let him find the outbox.  He's still got it on the outbox right now.  Yeah, I want to see  what he was writing.  I'm really going to nail myself  to the cross.  His volley back.  This is awful.  How'd you like it in your shitter?  Your turn. 
[02:09:00]  All right, all right, all right,  all right, all right, all right.  Are you ready for this,  you sons of bitches?  I would kneel over you  as you lay on your back,  running my dick over your lips  and down your breasts,  dripping all over your swollen pussy.  Dripping?  Dripping.  Dripping?  That means you're like a little boy.  A little bit of...  A little bit of the...  Gonorrhea.  Yeah, it's black.  She liked it.  Okay.  I make a doctor's appointment  for my drippy member.  It was good.  I'm not a novelist. 
[02:09:30]  I'll squeeze my cock over your face  like a glue gun.  And if you need me  talking in the tub,  just squeeze it against the...  Well, the relationship continues.  I know I'm not.  Noah the intern and the porn star.  It would make a great sitcom, I think.  The rubbing it over the lips part was good,  like kneeling over the face  is a dominant sort of thing.  But then trailing it down the breast,  it's awkward because you're on your knees  and you've got to kind of scooch down on your knees.  Yeah, what is that?  Right.  You're on a dolly?  Like, how do you do that?  Yeah, your phone sex isn't that accurate.  You're on your knees backwards going,  I'll put it in your mouth. 
[02:10:00]  It's like a Kubrick shot,  just coming down the long wall.  Dollying back as the background gets blurry.  Yeah, we're going to do a push-in.  That's right.  I'll put it in your mouth  and then have your toes in my asshole  at the same time.  We'll roll down a hill, dirty girl.  Chris, what's going on?  I've got a cliffhanger for you.  Yeah, we need a cliffhanger  so the people that are on the fence  are not sure if they're going to continue with the show.  They need something to, you know,  send them over the edge  and they'll continue listening on Monday.  Yes. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, send Noah to an AIDS test today  and give the results on Monday.  Oh, Noah's AIDS test.  Well, now, the chick is getting an AIDS test.  Yeah, that's my test, too.  Yeah, that would pretty much be his test.  All right.  Can we get those results?  I'll tell you.  I don't care.  I'm sure she's going to let you know.  Well, you'll know on the next text message  if she starts to say, like,  I can't wait to suck your cock in the hospital.  I'm sure she's fine, dude.  She's not a cliffhanger.  She doesn't have AIDS.  I want to come visit you again  before you lose too much weight. 
[02:11:00]  The cliffhanger here  is if I'm ever going to get laid by a real girl again.  This is every guy's fantasy,  but it surprisingly doesn't play well with the ladies.  Who cares?  Because they're intimidated.  They know they can't do what a porn girl does.  Regular girls can't.  No, I live with two girls.  They're my roommates.  Of course.  What do you expect?  You brought the porn star back to the...  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  I want to hear what Jack Tripper has to say here.  Yeah, exactly.  You live with two girls.  And how old are they?  They're my age.  Nothing sexual.  Are they attractive?  I grew up with them.  What were they saying  when they saw the porn star walking around?  Oh, they did.  Well, they heard it. 
[02:11:30]  They heard the event and the action.  I introduced her to some of my friends.  My one friend was sick  and we just ruined her whole day.  She was trying to nap.  Never had.  All of your friends are girls, by the way.  No, no, no.  I'm saying that's all I'm hearing.  So you guys are just banging  and not being quiet at all?  Yeah, I got calls from my downstairs neighbors  that were like,  you know, who are those guys?  You know what?  But I guess if you're going to bring a porn star home,  I think you want the whole neighborhood to know.  Do the whole show, right?  She's a screamer.  They're going to look at you a lot differently  when you're doing your laundry in the neighborhood  or picking up your Chinese food, yeah. 
[02:12:00]  With respect.  From you guys, not from the ladies.  They don't like it.  Because, again, that's everything that they're not.  A little threatened.  Women try to be sexy,  but, you know, a porn star is sexy.  Women in general try to do that  and to be measured against that,  they can't hold up.  Text message.  As you take out the garbage bag  and put it in the trash,  that's like their sexy line,  as you wash the car and go shopping.  I'll wear a little house coat  and flip-flops for you.  Yuck. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Groovy, this is your setup.  Yeah.  I would go for Joyce DeWitt.  Really?  I got nothing.  Nothing.  I'm waiting for you.  Great.  This is what you just said.  This is a virgin, virgin,  it's three's company, too.  Oh.  Coming, that's enough, baby.  Coming, fall on our floor.  Grab your chest and shock the crowd.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:00]  Two's company, too.  Sorry.  I was going for the aorta joke.  Oh.  Cancel our series, too.  Oh.  Cancel our series, too.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, another episode where they get all confused  about what the other one's saying.  Yeah.  Christy, Christy says she's positive.  That'd be like the 2000 version. 
[02:13:30]  Three's company.  I heard her say she's positive.  All right.  Noah.  Thank you.  There's the update.  He's still...  Cliffhanger.  ...in touch with the porn star.  Like a time-lapse camera on my dick.  See what goes on that one.  Yeah, see what rots on it.  Yeah, it's cute.  Good luck to you.  Thanks, guys.  I'm sure he's fine.  Of course he is.  Of course.  I wouldn't even have worn a bag.  That's the difference between me and him.  Yep, you wouldn't have.  No!  I would have laughed at it.  Yeah, but he won't use a bowl from, you know, the kitchen here.  I know.  He's not fucking the bowl.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He's eating out of it. 
[02:14:00]  Coopie and Anthony.  XM 202.  It's the worst.  Coopie and Anthony.  Bah!  Coopie and Anthony.  Oh, no.  Threat no more.  There's a cute piece in  To prepare for  So be it  Settle the score  Talk to me again for the words  That you will hear evermore  Gotta love Metallica. 
[02:14:30]  God damn.  Never gets old, right, Anthony?  No!  This is drive-like 90-mile-an-hour music.  Oh, yeah.  Love it.  I think it's time.  For the eggnog drinking contest on the Opie and Anthony program.  Steve is in place with his video camera.  Filming it for opieandanthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Ant hates these type of things.  I kind of get giddy.  I like these things.  Look at all the eggnog is out. 
[02:15:00]  Many cups lined up.  Yes, our ten contestants.  My brother Darren is going to be one of the official pourers.  Now, mathematically,  This is a little rough  Because if these guys are doing shots  Every minute  And there's ten guys  Do a little quick math  That would be six seconds per cup.  Six seconds to pour out  Each cup  So that everyone's ready for the next shot.  I'm up for the challenge.  You're up for the challenge.  Yes, absolutely.  It's a challenge within a challenge, Opie.  Do we have enough eggnog opened up? 
[02:15:30]  I think this is going to be just a clusterfuck.  I mean, I have confidence in our guys, but I don't know.  I think something's going to go horribly wrong here, Anthony.  A dirty animal.  I think it's probably closer to five seconds per pour  Because you're going to need a little bit of time  For them to then pick it up and do the shot.  Yes.  You know, the in-between time.  This sounds like the Warren Commission, you know,  With the shots.  I need to reload the cartridge before I pour again.  You can't possibly reload those cups quick enough.  You have me consorting with a real cast of beverages. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  It looks like they've got a system in place.  All right.  We'll see if it works out.  Noah's helping out.  It's his birthday today.  Oh.  Happy birthday, Noah.  Happy birthday.  Will you be banging a porn star for your birthday today?  Next month, hopefully.  Next month, hopefully.  We're getting them in the books.  She'll be back.  Did she call you or text you with a happy birthday message?  No, not yet.  She knows, though.  We talked last night, so she's good to go.  Oh, you talked last night.  Yeah, we did.  You guys really have something going.  No, not really.  I think we kindled a little something.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, you do. 
[02:16:30]  You anxiously wait for a phone call.  It's kind of a relationship.  You know when you're next seeing each other.  You call and talk to each other or text each other.  Technically, it's a relationship.  It's really low maintenance.  That's for sure.  I've got to give you that one.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  You don't have a steady?  No.  That wouldn't last very long at this point.  No?  No.  No, because he's banging a porn star on the side.  What girlfriend's going to put up with that?  It is kind of tough to tell your girlfriend.  A really good one.  A really good one.  There's a few of them out there that would.  Would, but. 
[02:17:00]  I guess.  I don't know.  Congrats.  All right.  Thank you.  And then we've got Nathaniel.  In between doing stand-up, he's now an official pour in the eggnog drinking contest.  Well, we all have dreams, Opie.  All right.  I guess we're ready for the contestants.  Oh, boy.  I just had a cup.  I could probably do five shots.  Really?  Really?  It's thick and creamy and noggy?  Yeah, but it has a watery undertone to it.  It's thick with a watery undertone.  You know, it's like drinking a blood clot.  Listen.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:17:30]  Listen, you're good.  But Anthony is brilliant when it comes to describing what contestants have to direct.  You did such a great job with the chowder eating contest.  The chowder was easy to describe.  The eggnog is a little harder, but it is, I don't know, a creamy mix.  There you go.  Just thick and creamy with a heavy flavor of vanilla.  Lukewarm.  Lukewarm.  And unfortunately, the cups are a little too tall to fill it up to the tippity top.  But it's up to the tippity top of the line. 
[02:18:00]  Of the line.  Pushing a little over the line.  And you just have to swig it down.  Perhaps it backs up a little in your esophagus where you can't get it down quite fast enough.  You've got to give it an extra swallow.  You've got to wish you had maybe a little piece of bread to kind of tamp it down.  And then before you know it, oh, the next shot.  Ready to go.  Thick and creamy like the first.  Filled right up to the tippy top of that line.  And down she goes for another one. 
[02:18:30]  Gulp.  And oh, before it even reaches your stomach.  Before you feel that gentle caress of thick nog lining your stomach walls.  Bam!  It's time for another.  And the cup is full in front of you.  And just like the first two, you belt it down.  And thick and hearty.  And creamy as it is.  And getting warmer and warmer.  It walks its way down.  Just a little warmer than the last shot.  And you just know shot after shot after shot is going to get a little warmer and warmer and warmer. 
[02:19:00]  And the ones at the edge next to Steve's shirt are going to be bubbling, piping hot, dare I say.  So good luck to all our contestants washing this mix down.  That's how you describe it, Morton.  Wonderful.  He's the pro.  It's hilarious.  All right.  Let's get the contestants in here.  We've stalled enough.  Bringing them in.  Ten of them, huh?  You're going to have room for all these guys?  Ten contestants. 
[02:19:30]  We've had to remove, I want to let everyone know that knows the description of the studio.  We've had to remove the lesbian couch.  That space is now replaced with lined garbage pails.  And that looks like my bathroom floor.  Yeah, there's plastic on the floor.  And there's garbage pails.  There's garbage pails where the lesbian couch usually is.  And, guys, I cannot emphasize enough that those pails are there. 
[02:20:00]  They are to be used just in case that creamy, thick mix of egg and nog starts working its way back up.  You can turn around, grab a pail, and go to town.  All right.  Well, why don't we meet our contestants, Anthony?  Let's meet our contestants.  And don't forget, we've got five other contestants from all over the country that are playing as well.  Right.  They guessed how many shots the last guy's going to do without puking.  We'll see who's right, and they will see my five as well. 
[02:20:30]  Who do we got?  How you doing, guys?  I'm Dice.  Hey, Dice.  What's up?  I brought you those shirts.  I brought some DVDs this time around.  I just got to say, that shit dick song fucked me up.  Yeah, you like the shit dick?  I was banging a chick in the ass on Wednesday night.  I finish, and I'm humming shit dick the whole time.  It's not the best thing you want to do.  The chick I'm banging likes a shit dick.  We'll play that again for you.  Thank you.  All right.  As soon as you puke, we'll play that for you.  Works for me.  Where are you from, Dice?  Long Island.  Long Island.  Right on.  Of course.  We met Pat.  Pat.  Hi.  From earlier. 
[02:21:00]  I really should be working to pay off those tickets.  Yeah.  He did our last contest.  It cost him like $900.  Yeah.  Because he decided you could just, yeah, park your van in the middle of 57th Street in New  York City.  He had a suspended license.  He got arrested for it.  He even stands like a psychopath.  Your favorite?  With the hands straight down, not moving.  How much away, Pat?  350.  350.  He's got to be one of the favorites.  I'm thinking the fatter guys are the favorites.  You think?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, this would be my forte.  Forte.  All right.  Thanks.  And Pat, where are you from again? 
[02:21:30]  Munaki, New Jersey.  That's right.  Munaki.  New Jersey.  And then we got Matt.  What's up, Matt?  What's going on?  Where are you from, bro?  Jersey.  More Jersey guys.  Jersey just supporting the show.  Jersey Represent.  Wow.  Big time.  Any shout outs?  Anything you want to say before the contest begins?  Just if you've got a Dodge truck, I'd like to work on it.  Check out RamChargerCentral.com.  It's a good message board.  Yeah, I'm plugging my...  What the hell, man?  It's fine.  You should get at least five hits from that today. 
[02:22:00]  You belong to a truck message board?  Yeah.  Do you put in parentheses, sound of air horn?  That's quite exciting.  Driveshaft, LOL.  Do they have names like that?  No, it's...  Like Hemi?  Sure.  I'm Hemi 102.  Hey, hi.  How you doing?  Hey, whatever.  You know?  Yeah.  It's just a place to go if you need help with your truck. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, you sound a little taller in email.  All right.  All right, let's move on to Joe.  Joe, where are you from?  From Queens.  Queens.  Nice.  Representing Queens.  Anything?  No, I can't compete with truck driving message boards.  So, right now, I'm thinking this is probably the worst idea I've done this morning.  How many shots do you think you could do?  The guys are starting to look at the eggnog.  Yeah.  I don't even...  It's the color.  It's this...  Oh. 
[02:23:00]  I'm going to try to do 20, and then I might have to punch out.  To be honest with the color, it's like old jizz yellow.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a hepatitis load.  Hey, how do you feel?  How do you feel about Pedro joining your Mets there in Queens?  See, I'm a Yankee fan, so...  You know what?  I'm glad we got Randy last night.  Did they really?  Well, they still got to work on some deal through...  Eric Duncan, something like three minor leaguers.  Vasquez goes to L.A. 
[02:23:30]  The fucking Yankees.  Can they stop giving up young talent for 50-year-old pitchers?  Cocksucker Steinbrenner.  That really annoys me.  Thanks.  Young talent.  There you go, Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  Who else?  Joe from Queens.  Did it again.  BJ.  We know BJ.  He's been around the block a few times.  Where are you from, BJ, again?  Oakdale.  Oakdale.  Long Island representing Anthony.  Anything you want to say today, BJ?  I want to say hi to Big Dave and Thundar out in Oakdale and everybody in whackbag.com.  And I'll plug Hugbox.net, you know, free girl porn site, you know. 
[02:24:00]  Hugbox.  You ever do any drinking down at the wharf down there?  Uh, yeah.  Put in water?  Yeah, you used to go down there a lot when we had a boat.  This is a shithole.  I know.  It's a real shithole.  But it's a great place to go if you have a boat real close.  Yeah.  You do some drinking.  You go out on the boat.  You drink.  You come back.  Maybe slam some guy from Pennsylvania in the back of the head.  Come back.  Drink more.  It's a lot of fun.  Then you go on N.E.W. and do a radio show.  You're a baby. 
[02:24:30]  Fabulous.  BJ.  All right, BJ.  Thank you.  Bang the girls from the college over there, do you?  What college is there?  Dowling?  Dowling.  No, I don't talk to anybody in Dowling.  Nothing good there at Dowling?  Nah, there's a bunch of black people and Chinese people.  Black people and Chinese people?  Yeah, we don't talk to them much.  Good boy.  If they're not stealing, they're staring blank with no expression on their face.  Gotta love Oakdale.  Thank you, BJ.  All right.  You're welcome.  Hey, John.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Where are you from, bud?  I'm from Connecticut. 
[02:25:00]  Connecticut representing.  Yeah.  And what do you want to say today?  I don't know much.  I want to say hello to the guys at obanthony.net.  I'm on there as grizzly.  I also thank my sister for coming down.  Moral support today.  She's out.  Oh, I thought she was going to be in the contest.  We were hoping one of these girls were going to be in the contest today.  Well, she really doesn't like eggnog.  Who does, though?  I know.  I do.  Yeah.  Oh, we were going to have little bite-sized fruitcakes here.  Oh, right.  We forgot about that.  A little awful fruitcakes.  I see it's Land O'Lakes eggnog.  Yeah.  The same company that makes the butter, so it's all creamy, buttery, I'm sure, also. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I'm ready.  And you guys, make sure you don't puke on us, please.  You guys all look around and see where the garbage pails are.  We should have made the meat.  Do our best.  Eggnog and some sort of meat.  Some sort of meat?  A little cube of meat.  Like pork?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's move on to Steve over there, who's wearing one of my brother's fine T-shirts,  I noticed.  Oh.  Turn around, man.  Got a sign on the back by the artist today.  Oh, right on. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  My brother's What's In Your Pants T-shirts.  Fine T-shirts.  Very cool.  Not much to say.  From Brooklyn.  All right.  You can email Dr. Duckhasm.  Dr. Duckhasm?  Dr. D-U-K at AOL.com if you want one of these fine, open, Anthony What's In Your Pants T-shirts.  Shameless plug.  Shameless plug.  Speaking of shameless plugs, eatabull.com.  Thank you, mister.  Oh, look at you, Steve.  Anything else you want to say?  Downtown, December 23rd, next Thursday.  Oh, by the way, Nathaniel will also be performing there with our intern. 
[02:26:30]  We'll be doing some.  Yeah, Norton at the downtown.  Throw in the kid a bone.  Nah, he's funny.  Who's breathing like Darth Vader?  Is that you?  Yeah, what's wrong, Steve?  Wow.  Well, it's just a little hot in here.  I thought we were on the Death Star.  It's really hot in here.  It's hot so you have emphysema?  It really is hot in here, which is going to make this contest even worse.  Oh, even better.  Oh, man, the eggnog is starting to boil a little bit.  Oh, by the second, it's just getting hotter and hotter.  It's starting to get a little clumpy, I notice, Anthony.  Oh.  All right, Ellis, we talked, he had his stomach done, so he's just not going to last. 
[02:27:00]  Who is he kidding?  I'd like to dedicate winning this my fight to my surgeon, who helped me lose 140 pounds.  All right.  There you go.  All right, very good.  If I don't pass out first.  Okay.  And then, finally, Doug, we talked to Doug earlier, too.  He's from Arizona.  He flew in just for the contest, Anthony.  Dedication.  Anything you want to say, Doug?  Go Sun Devils in the Sun Bowl.  Fuck Purdue.  Fuck Purdue, right?  All right.  There you go.  All right, Doug.  Fuck a chicken.  All right, I think we're ready.  Do you want to get the rules, Anthony? 
[02:27:30]  They're pretty simple, I guess.  The rules are simple.  Our contestants will do one of these glasses full of creamy eggnog every minute.  Every minute.  If you puke, out and see.  If you have to take a leak, whether it's in your pants or you actually leave and go to the bathroom,  oot!  You're oot!  The last guy left that has not puked or pissed himself.  is the winner of the MiFi.  That is how we play the game. 
[02:28:00]  You all understand?  Very good.  You guys all know what cup you're going for?  I guess the cups are numbered, Dan?  Yeah, we will not be doing a Le Mans start where they run to their cups.  And you guys all know where the garbage pails are, right?  Sadly, right behind me.  Yes, please.  More important than an exit in a building on fire, please take note.  Just pick up whichever cup you want.  You're going to have to hold it the whole time. 
[02:28:30]  Wait, one question.  Do we have to kind of like slam them or can we take the whole minute to drink?  What do you want?  You will have a whole minute.  You can strategically use that minute however you want if you want to do it slow.  But then just remember, the next one's right around the corner.  Some guys that want to chug it can then use the rest of the minute to relax and maybe get that down.  Guys, here's the deal, too.  We've got two sets of cups here because they're pouring as you're drinking.  All right?  So just try to go for the, well, whatever.  Just grab one.  Can I make a holiday toast for the first shot?  Sure, Kenny. 
[02:29:00]  All right, Kenny.  Good one, Kenny.  Let's everyone raise their glass to our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Because, and of course, little Jim, who I love dear.  Now, don't drink until you hear the bell because we want it on one of the second hand on the 12.  We're going to go right at the 12, Kenny.  So go.  Go with your toast.  You've got five seconds.  But without Opie and Anthony, this would not be made possible.  So here we go.  And then the first one.  The contest has begun, Anthony.  It has begun every time that second hand sweeps to the 12. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  No, you don't have to drink it right away.  Yeah, hold your, you should hold the glasses.  Oh, they're just going to be doing it.  Hold on.  No, no.  Yeah, but then we won't be able to keep track.  It's got to be every minute.  Hold on, hold on.  Every minute, guys.  Every minute.  Every minute.  They're already wrecking the contest.  You do one a minute.  You can't start chugging them all down.  I like that enthusiasm, though.  I like that, too.  All right.  But everyone did their first shot of eggnog, right?  What did it taste like?  And that guy, it tasted like the squid bucket from Bob Murphy.  And that guy, Philip Steve's cup, he screwed up. 
[02:30:00]  He's officially on the clock for drinking only one eggnog.  Right.  He decided to get cocky, Anthony, and do two right away.  Opie, if this comes down to one eggnog, and he's in it, and it worked out that that extra  shot he did puts him over the top, I'm sure we'll have a disappointed lad.  All right.  The cups are all filled.  Wow.  And look how quickly this comes about.  Wow.  That is quick.  All right.  Two.  One.  And here goes the second round.  Second round.  Goes down as easy as the first. 
[02:30:30]  I see BJ's taking that slower drinking of the eggnog.  Doug from Arizona is having a little problem there.  I see it in his face.  What's going on, Doug?  Strategy.  Do we have a mic over there?  I'm sick.  Strategy.  Strategy.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Slow and steady wins the race.  All right.  So, Anthony, everyone finish their second?  Everyone finish their second.  John automatically grabbed his third, and he's holding it there.  Eager beaver.  Ellis, what's going on with that little stomach of yours?  Not a problem at all. 
[02:31:00]  He's got a nog mustache going.  All right.  Looks like he just got a ride from an older gentleman.  Jesus.  All right, Anthony, we're getting close to the third round.  Everyone's got their eggnog in their hands, waiting for the start of the third round here.  Amazing how quickly that minute goes by, isn't it?  Wow.  There they go.  Too quick, right?  It's here already.  I'm thinking after five or so, you're going to start seeing a bit of a change.  There goes the third round.  And the people's attitudes.  I'm looking around the room. 
[02:31:30]  Dice is doing okay in the corner there.  Joe is the first to finish there.  Taste animal.  BJ is.  Everyone's down.  How's everyone feeling?  Still confident?  Still confident.  Wow.  Yeah, Joe, what's going on?  It's starting to weigh Joe down a little bit.  What?  What's going on, Joe?  You don't look too good already.  Yeah, I said it's starting to weigh me down like Conor and Lacey.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Ben, anything else?  Any other observations?  All right, Anthony, the third round is done by everybody.  We're filling up the cups for the fourth round. 
[02:32:00]  Is anyone starting to think, wow, I might not be able to do this after just three?  No.  Anyone?  No?  How about you, Steve?  You're on your ninth.  I'm fine.  Good to go.  Good to go?  Good to go, Jim.  All right.  Any trash talking?  Nothing?  You guys are?  I think Dice over there is starting to puss out, man.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I got moved over by the bird man.  I was fine on the other side of Pat.  All right, here we go.  If I got a puke, I can climb over him.  Hit the bell for the fourth round.  Here we go.  This is the fourth double shot of eggnog.  It really does come around quickly. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, it sure does.  All right.  Joe slammed his cup down.  There they go.  John, Doug from Arizona.  Pat, how are you holding up over there?  The big guy, Pat?  Tastes like pancake batter.  Tastes like pancake batter?  Warm pancake batter, Anthony.  And why would you know what pancake batter tastes like?  Ooh.  Ooh, a little trash.  I like it.  All right.  Nice punch in the stomach after a bunch of eggnog.  Let's find out what's in my hands.  A good horse foot to the stomach.  Anthony, another carton done. 
[02:33:00]  Ellis, you were a little slow there.  You all right?  I'm pacing myself.  He's the guy with the small stomach.  Yeah.  He's not going to last too much longer.  I got a minute to drink this thing, you said.  Yeah, you're right.  Hold on.  We're getting ready for the fifth shot.  Wait for the bell.  Wow.  Go ahead, raisin's stomach.  I got four double shots in him, Anthony.  How could that little stomach hold that?  It won't.  It really won't.  Yeah.  We are coming around again.  Another minute is complete.  And there you go.  This is the fifth double shot of eggnog.  Let's look and see.  It's not going down as fast with a couple of people. 
[02:33:30]  Joe's got...  I don't know.  Your eyes are tearing a little bit or something's going on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got a little redder in the face, a little hotter in here.  Anyone else have something to say?  Just raise your hand and Eric will give you the mic.  Ellis is sipping it like it's a Manhattan.  Ellis has a minute.  Ellis is the one with the small stomach.  I got another 30 seconds before I got to finish this one.  Yes, you do.  Then the next one will start immediately.  Anybody else?  Anyone else?  When did a small stomach become equal to you to a pussy, exactly?  You were talking shit outside.  Like, ooh, I can do this. 
[02:34:00]  I wasn't the one out there blowing a midget to stay warm.  Ooh.  Wow.  Hey, wow.  I don't know what that means, but...  Whatever it is.  Ellis just finished.  I'll leave it on that one.  I got nothing.  All right.  Ellis...  15 seconds left.  All right.  Ellis finishes up.  Five shots done already, right?  Five shots were on?  Yeah.  Somebody's got to keep tabs on this.  This is the sixth round coming up in about five seconds.  You got tabs on this?  I think they're going to get to the 10 easily, and then it's going to get interesting.  Anthony, yeah.  Get ready.  Six rounds.  That's begun.  Sixth round of eggnog. 
[02:34:30]  And Joe is the one who's finishing consistently first.  Got to get him down quick and then rest for 40 seconds, I guess.  That would seem to be the good strategy.  I think the guys that are nursing it for the whole minute, a little more pressures on  these guys.  Has everyone finished?  Even Ellis slammed that one.  Okay.  Anyone feeling anything?  Just stepping up.  I'm feeling good, man.  I'm good.  Everyone's good so far.  It's coming out of Ellis' nose and ears now, though.  That could be a problem.  Ellis is leaking eggnog a little bit.  Uh-oh.  All right.  They're filling up the cups, Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  The seventh round is on its way.  Damn.  Pat, how are you?  One pussy coming.  All of a sudden, you're slamming them with the rest of us now.  Hey, what do you want me to say, man?  Wow, there's a rivalry.  How about I drink yours, too?  I don't think I'll be able to handle it.  I don't know.  Side wager?  Dice and Ellis are going at it, Anthony.  What was the problem there between these two?  All right.  On the bell, guys.  The seventh round of eggnog will begin.  Here's another minute.  Gone.  Jesus, a minute goes quick.  I'm looking around the room.  Another round.  Pat is done. 
[02:35:30]  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done.  BJ's done.  John's done.  Steve's done.  No, Steve is still sipping.  Okay, now Steve's done.  Ellis is done and Doug.  Doug, how are you feeling from Arizona?  Fantastic.  You?  I don't have to drink this crap.  I'm doing all right.  It's not affecting him yet.  No.  You think it's going to be a little higher than we anticipated, Opie?  I don't know.  Nah.  No.  Or you think it'll kick in?  No, BJ's already shaking his head.  No way.  Or you think it's going to kick in, like, quickly, where it's going to turn around?  Yeah.  It's going to hit you.  Absolutely.  BJ is the smallest contestant. 
[02:36:00]  I think he's in risk of getting out very early in the competition.  Smallest contestant in this batch doesn't mean you're small, either.  Believe me.  If I'm the first one out before Ellis, that really sucks.  You don't want to lose to Ellis.  I'm kind of scared.  I'm beginning to smell like a puke smell coming from this dude right here.  Remember the little chick that always wins the Nathan Hot Dog Contest?  Yeah.  That's true.  All right.  Thank you, Club Soda Kenny.  Brilliant.  As always.  There it is.  Here comes the eighth round, Anthony.  Eighth round.  This is eight double shots of eggnog. 
[02:36:30]  Most of the guys having no problem still.  Joe making a lot of faces, though.  Yeah.  That was like a chunk of I don't know what in that one.  Well, the eggnog's getting clumpier.  It's been warming up all morning.  Yeah.  Now, eight of these two-ounce shots would make it 16 ounces.  That's right.  Anyone feeling anything they want to talk about?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  You guys all good still?  There's another carton gone.  You all right?  Did anybody get the stalker patty pubes? 
[02:37:00]  Oh.  No, that was a toenail.  No one's having any problems.  Joe, you look like you're having problems.  No, no.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Maybe it's strategy.  Maybe he's playing possum, Anthony.  Playing possum.  It's like poker.  That's true.  All right.  He could lay back, make people think he's injured.  Ellis, you all right?  With the small stomach?  Okay.  I cannot possibly see how he's doing that.  All right.  Here we go.  We're just kind of about around, and there it is.  And we're up to the ninth round of eggnog.  I'm trying to get a line on how they're feeling by the way they drink these down. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Steve's taking his slow approach or slower approach.  Ellis kind of having a little more trouble washing this one down?  No?  No.  Just the taste.  He's making a milk.  Just the taste is kind of snotty.  Well, maybe not the taste.  The consistency is kind of like a viscous, you know?  Yeah.  It's very smooth.  Very thick and viscous.  Yeah.  Like grease and oil.  Yeah.  All right.  Ellis is the only one.  Oh, Ellis and Steve.  They're starting to slow down a little bit.  Yep.  Steve, you all right?  I'm all right. 
[02:38:00]  I'm fine.  All right.  Steve finished up his ninth.  He's fine.  And the cups get refilled.  Double shot of eggnog.  Ellis, you're done?  Okay, Ellis is done, too.  These guys are all East Coast drunks.  You're not going to get anybody puking on 10.  It's going to be a little while.  Yeah, but it's a lot different than being out drinking some real fun booze.  This is thick, creamy, nauseating.  Heavy.  Heavy.  Did I say thick?  Yes, you did.  And creamy.  There it is.  Number 10.  Here goes number 10.  We thought we'd be seeing a reaction by 10.  Looking around the room, Anthony. 
[02:38:30]  Pat's done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done.  Wow.  BJ's slowing down a little bit, but he just completed.  John.  And, of course, Steve and Ellis taking their time once again.  Steve taking their time.  And Doug from Arizona having no problem so far.  Ellis is starting to swish it around in his mouth, like hold it in his mouth a little  bit.  That's not a good sign.  I think I found my talent.  Yeah.  What's that?  And this stuff.  Well, there's a resume stuffer.  That's a good one.  Pat's definitely the one to beat right here.  He has the eye of the tiger.  Yeah, definitely.  He's enjoying it.  It's like the eye of the tiger and the stomach of a rhinos. 
[02:39:00]  Do I mention my diabetes?  I mention my diabetes.  What an ass.  And, John, I saw you shaking your head like you were shaking off a punch after that last  cup.  I was just letting it all just drip down the gullet a little bit.  You ever see a boxer get hit and he kind of goes, you know, shakes it off?  I saw him doing that.  Yeah, it's getting a little more interesting.  A little bit.  I think we're going to get to 20, no problem, and then it's going to just get out.  It won't be no problem.  We're on 10 now.  There it is.  This is the 11th round, Anthony.  That's all the eggnog we got?  John looks like Brother Joe with Down Syndrome. 
[02:39:30]  Huh?  Are we going to run out of eggnog?  If we're going to run out of eggnog, someone better go get some now.  Like pronto.  That would ruin the contest.  We only have two.  We only have six.  How many have we been through?  Three gallons.  I'm not sure how many we've been through yet.  Where can we get eggnog?  Somebody better go right now.  Oh, my God.  Just in case.  Underestimation of the eggnog supply?  Just in case.  Just in case.  All right, Anthony.  What?  This is the 11th round.  How's everyone doing? 
[02:40:00]  I was studying the eggnog in the cooler.  Very good.  I like how you jumped on that, though, Opie, and you saw maybe a dilemma developing.  I saw Nathaniel to my left panicking going, we're going through this very fast.  Yeah.  If we switch brands of eggnog, is that going to affect people?  No.  Hey.  All right.  Everyone get their 11th round down?  Steve is slowing way down, dude.  Wow, Steve.  I haven't even finished it.  Steve, you might be out.  Steve, did you finish?  Drink.  Drink.  No?  Is he out?  I don't know if we made that one of our rules, did we? 
[02:40:30]  Well, you have a minute to drink every round.  He's got to finish this up.  All right.  From now on, if you don't finish by the time the next round starts, you're out.  Steve barely made it.  I don't think we made that clear.  All right.  So now we're up to the 12th round, Anthony.  I know.  Steve is sounding like Frankie Blue.  No problem, baby.  And there's no alcohol in this eggnog, but it affects you the same way.  Steve, you had a problem with that last cup.  Please let us know what's going on.  You're not drinking this one.  Eric, get over there.  Steve, get over there.  Pay attention.  I'm all right.  You're all right? 
[02:41:00]  Well, you have 25 seconds to finish that one up.  Get it down.  Get that thick beverage down, that thick, heavy beverage.  Uh-oh.  Nice one.  Has everyone else finished?  Swallow that thick beverage.  15 seconds, Steve.  Everyone else finished, right?  Filled with sugar.  You can do it.  10 seconds, Steve.  Steve.  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds, Steve.  Wash it down.  Oh!  And he's still in, but barely.  He's all right.  And pick up another one, Steve.  Is Ellis out?  I can't take any more down.  A small stomach Ellis is out, Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  Ellis is out.  Let's say goodbye to Ellis.  Thank you, Ellis.  Valiant effort.  It was great coming up here.  He was the wrong shot in this contest with his little pea stomach.  So, uh, good luck.  Contestant is out.  He couldn't handle any more eggnog.  Now beat it, Raisin Belly.  We're in the middle of the 13th round, Anthony.  I'm on my way, too, guys.  Huh?  What?  I'm on my way, too.  Go ahead, Steve.  Oh, come on, Steve.  Chug it, come on.  We've got 30 seconds left.  Come on, Steve.  Come on.  Take it like it's the load of an uncle.  Yeah, we don't want you bowing out without finishing.  You've got to at least give it a shot.  We want to see some puking, man. 
[02:42:00]  He didn't get a puke.  He'll be fine.  All right, you've got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished their round, right?  Come on.  All right, here goes Steve.  Come on.  Take that cup of liquid snot.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, Steve.  Give it a shot.  Thick and creamy.  Come on, Steve.  10 seconds to get the 13th shot of eggnog down.  Uh-oh.  He's having some trouble.  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds.  Two.  Four.  Three.  Two.  He can't do it.  He's out.  He is out.  Oh, wow.  And the 14th round started.  Now it's very interesting, Anthony. 
[02:42:30]  Now, Steve, you've got to spin it in a circle.  All right, thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys, for letting me come on.  Thank you, Steve.  There he goes.  We'll see you after the contest, but we just want to clear the studio out.  Oh, burned.  Anthony, this is for the MuFi.  We're down to eight contestants.  We're in the 14th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  What's going on?  Two in a row.  I've been concentrating on those two that have just been knocked out of the competition.  Haven't really given any attention to the other guys.  How are we feeling?  Fine. 
[02:43:00]  Good.  Everyone else is fine.  Wait, everyone drank their 14th like nothing?  Yep.  Wow, we're just sitting here waiting for the 15th round to start.  It doesn't affect you guys?  The two guys are out now?  They don't care.  It's good.  It motivates us.  It motivates you.  It doesn't make you think, wow, a few more shots and it's going to get ugly here.  That too.  All right.  Wow, there's a cheering section outside of the window holding up signs now.  Great.  I got fans.  Big boys.  And the 15th round starts.  Go, Pat.  And then another sign, hope you puke. 
[02:43:30]  We only have seven contestants?  I don't know.  Didn't we start with ten?  We started with nine.  Oh, we started with nine.  Okay.  I don't know, Opie.  I just start thinking of boss's ear.  What?  Oh, we had a spot for the guy from Maine.  All right, this is the 15th round, Anthony.  Seems the eggnog is draining any humor that might have been in these guys.  Jesus.  Dice, how are you feeling over there?  Feeling fine.  Feeling fine, okay.  Pat, you all right?  Piece of cake?  I don't even notice it yet. 
[02:44:00]  Uh-oh.  We'll go a couple more hours.  A couple more hours.  All right.  Yeah, you can.  Everyone got their fifth.  BJ's still in the contest, Ant.  BJ, yeah.  He was thought to have been one of the long times.  But he's standing too stiff.  BJ's not happy right now.  He's standing too relaxed.  He really wants to vomit.  I was surprised to see Steve out so early.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's a big guy.  I thought he was going to do good.  I knew that an old change purse stomach was going to have trouble, but we're up to the  16th round of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:44:30]  John slammed his.  Doug from Arizona slammed his.  Going around the room.  Everyone's still having no problem.  John, how are you feeling?  You're rubbing your belly.  You're rubbing your belly.  Just massaging it in there.  All right.  It's good.  I'm getting close, I think.  I hope not.  BJ's getting close.  Now, what makes you think you're getting close?  I want to know what the feeling is.  I don't know.  Bloat?  Kind of, yeah.  Yeah, but the thing is, like, the other two, they just quit. 
[02:45:00]  I'm going to keep drinking until I puke my brain.  That's what we want to hear today.  Somebody just shit their pants.  I don't know if that's strategy or something, but it is horrific.  Who the F farted?  Kenny, is it you?  That was my big announcement.  All right.  Well, Anthony, it stinks in the studio.  There it is, guys.  Another one.  17th round in the eggnog drinking contest.  17. 
[02:45:30]  And John just slamming it.  Pat slammed his.  Yeah.  Doug from Arizona.  A little slow, but he got down.  A little slower than before.  And BJ still in the competition.  Everyone done?  John?  Who's Joe or eggnog?  They better hurry up.  No.  How are we doing on eggnog supply?  How many left?  Three over there.  How many over there?  How many over there?  We should be all right for now until we get more.  Two left over here.  They're going to buy too many now to bring back 30.  Oh, we're going to have, like, 800 things of eggnog over here.  Guys, any, uh, Matt, how you doing? 
[02:46:00]  It's filling up, but it's, uh, yeah, just make a little more room.  Making a little more room.  Oh, my God.  I like his flaming shirt.  I like Steve.  BJ's closing his eyes, Anthony, and concentrating.  Is it a concentrating move, or is it like I'm going to puke move?  It's a concentrating move, trying to ignore that little sharp pain in my stomach right now.  And 18.  There we go.  It's going to be a little hard to ignore when you're drinking a little more.  Here we go.  The 18th round of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:46:30]  Pat's just slamming.  Wow.  Pat's unbeatable.  What does Dice have to say about that, though?  Dice?  I think it's me and Pat at the end.  Really?  You're having no problem?  Dice and Pat having no problem.  I'm a long island Elkie.  What do you expect?  Matt having a little bit of a problem.  Joe just making a lot of faces.  I don't know what that means, Anthony.  But he seems to be putting it down okay.  BJ, I got a few more rounds left in me, and if he doesn't show any cracks, it's his.  No, no, no.  You got it.  I mean, we need to see some puking, man.  You got to take one for the team. 
[02:47:00]  BJ?  His stomach's pretty full.  Oh, you're fine, BJ.  Yeah, he's...  Sure.  Wait, did you finish your last one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So everyone finished it?  Yep.  Nineteenth round is done.  Doug, how are you feeling over there from Arizona?  I'm going until I vomit.  All right.  The Arizona spirit.  Who's cheating?  I was...  Figured out quick.  You were what?  Grab number nine.  Fuck it.  Go with nine.  Oh, they're mixing up each other.  All right.  Here we go.  There it is.  19th round has begun in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:47:30]  Someone is...  The notes are going up on the window.  Do it for Connor, BJ.  Oh, do it for little Connor.  There's a hope you puke on the window, and big boys rule, go Pat.  I think, uh...  BJ's ready to puke.  Eric was a little alarmed that Joe was having a problem.  Did he gag a little?  It was a little...  A little...  A little reflex.  A little...  A little trouble getting that one down, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, you have 30 seconds.  BJ's going to puke soon.  This may be it, this one.  Nah, you'll be fine, BJ.  Come on, BJ.  Well, he got that down, right? 
[02:48:00]  BJ's face is looking a little different than earlier.  That festive, I'm here having fun look.  Gone from his face.  It's been replaced by a, holy shit, I'm going to vomit look.  That determined, I will not puke.  You know that look you get when you're fucked up and you know you're going to vomit?  I'm not going to puke, man.  Not this time.  You're fine, dude.  You're fine.  I just got to get through my radio shift.  Kenny.  Baby.  And...  20th round has begun in the eggnog drinking contest.  Kenny, you can let the girls and stuff in.  We have more room in the studio. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  More eggnog, please.  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh, BJ.  BJ, you're fine.  Take it down.  All eyes are on BJ.  Oh, his glasses are coming off.  He took his glasses off.  Uh-oh.  I don't want them falling in.  He doesn't want them falling in the...  He got 45 seconds.  In the fell as he pukes.  Come on, BJ.  That's plenty of time, BJ.  BJ.  Oh!  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  There it is.  There it is. 
[02:49:00]  The first...  Can I finish this so I can puke more?  Yeah, you can.  Go ahead, BJ.  Sure, you got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished the 20th round.  BJ, we're going to have to say goodbye to BJ.  Like a champ, he's finishing up the 20th cup of eggnog.  What a good sport he is.  What a good egg.  What a trooper, man.  Let's hear it for BJ.  Whackbag.com.  Whackbag.com, yes.  Our first vomit release.  That was a pretty puke.  That was a good one.  Here it is.  Uh-oh, Joe.  You drank it down, right, Joe?  You're all right.  Joe just drank it down. 
[02:49:30]  He's holding the edges of the bucket and leaning over a little and bouncing.  Was that his 20th or the 21st?  That was 20th.  Whatever we're up to.  It was fine.  Oh, so Joe still has to do the 21st.  No, no, Joe just did it.  No, that was fine.  He sucked that one right down.  He really can't make him spin in a circle after every shot.  How nice of this is.  Whoa.  All right, we're down.  BJ's still puking out there.  Is he?  He's going, oh, that was cool.  Thank you, Club Cervant County.  All right.  What did Jimmy Dorton just do?  Joe, did you get that on tape? 
[02:50:00]  I went to look out the window, and I fucking forgot that the glass comes in.  I just smashed my head on it.  It's double-paned with about a foot and a half in between, and he thought it was the far  window, so he went to look out it and smashed his head.  There we go.  Oh!  Did he puke?  Yes, he did.  Did you puke?  Yeah.  I sucked him out.  Oh, Joe is out.  Joe is out.  And we're ready to drink more.  Punch out, Margaret.  Wow, Joe puked.  All right, Joe puked.  The 22nd round of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, no.  Why don't we move the contestants into the center so we know who's who now?  We've got Doug from Arizona.  We've got John still in the contest.  We've got Matt, Dice, and Pat.  Wow.  We're down to the last five, Anthony.  We have had two puking losses.  That's a good sign for me.  This is for the MiFi, the portable XM satellite radio.  The wall cheering us on.  Which one?  The shit dicks are behind you, Dice.  Yeah.  All right.  It's classic.  They're putting up signs as the contest continues.  Look at that smudge your head left on the window, Jim. 
[02:51:00]  I know, I know.  It looks really smart.  That big spot on the window where you clocked your head.  Eric, everyone get their 20-second shot down?  Yep.  Okay.  Yep, we're coming up on, what, 10 seconds left before the next one?  Nope, they're all right.  Two people out by puking.  Two more out by just saying they've had it.  And we have five seconds left before the next shot, guys.  Here it comes.  And we're up to the 23rd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat putting that one down like he put down his first, Opie. 
[02:51:30]  My brothers are very impressed with Pat.  My brothers are very impressed with Pat.  I'm getting a good whip to puke in a garbage can.  How is it?  It's great.  It's beautiful.  Uh-oh.  Dice and Creamy.  Doug from Arizona having a little problem.  He came a long way, Anthony.  Come on, Doug.  Think of all the egg yolks.  We're going to have to eat oatmeal for a week to get our cholesterol back down.  Probably a month.  You're talking like shit and you bring up cholesterol.  Wait, what?  Dice, who brings up cholesterol when they're trying to talk shit?  That's a good point.  Go, go have a piece of bacon.  Your cholesterol will get higher today. 
[02:52:00]  That was just fucking stupid.  Doug is just sipping, Anthony.  I don't think he's going to make it.  No, he's not going to make it.  Come on, Doug.  We've got 15 seconds left, Doug.  Doug said he'll drink until he pukes.  Doug from Arizona is still in there.  What a trooper.  He's still in.  Drinking like one of those Arizona Indians.  Nothing.  They prefer Native Americans.  Wait, is everyone in?  Matt and I make this one.  Matt's got...  No.  Matt's fine.  That's right.  Drink it down.  Wait, is he one behind? 
[02:52:30]  No.  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was behind.  All right, so this is the 24th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  How are you feeling?  And Matt looks like he's filling up.  It's in between Doug and Matt.  That one out next, I think.  Doug has a full cup left.  With 40 seconds to go.  It's been 20 seconds.  Come on, Doug.  You can do it.  To this round, he hasn't taken a sip.  There's his first sip.  Doug, you flew all the way from Arizona on JetBlue, man.  Think about the motion of that plane.  No.  Turbulence.  30 seconds, Doug.  25 seconds, Doug. 
[02:53:00]  The smell of a bad pussy.  He is trying, man.  Wash his ears.  Yeah.  A little rough.  Someone's scraping their tongue and holding it under your nose.  He's...  15 seconds.  15 seconds, Anthony.  He's fine, Dick.  Is the end of the...  Just suck it.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, wow!  Wow, that was as close as you could come to puking.  You got five seconds, my friend.  Come on, Doug.  Five seconds.  Slam it.  Come on.  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it down.  Slam it.  You got it.  Yeah, he just made it, Anthony.  There he is.  Just made it.  And just in time to do another. 
[02:53:30]  The 25th round...  Oh!  A lot of puking on it.  Matt has puked.  And he's shaking.  Matt is out.  He's shaking like a dog and it's flying everywhere.  Matt is out.  Matt is out of the contest.  Just couldn't do it.  Wow.  Couldn't do it.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Matt.  My suggestion for the next round is get a wider...  Man, his puke went kind of flying all over the place, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  It was like a scene out of Turner and Hooch. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that's exactly it.  He's shaking his head and vomits flying.  Uh-oh.  Doug's got a problem again, Anthony.  Doug's got 20 seconds left and he's got almost a full cup there.  Come on, Doug.  You flew in for a drink.  Wait, and I'm also noticing Dice doesn't have a...  All right, he's getting it down.  No, Dice went...  10 seconds left.  Yeah, Dice went with some strategy.  He waits the last minute.  Oh, Doug is bowing out.  Doug, you're bowing out with that zona.  Oh, and that's it.  That's it.  We got a gag out of Doug.  Dice is having problems.  He's having problems.  Dice is having problems now. 
[02:54:30]  Please.  I think Matt puking right next to Dice was a little bit of a problem for Dice.  All right, we got Dice, Pat, and John left in the contest.  Three guys left.  Dice, you got 45 seconds and a full glass.  You haven't touched it yet.  What are you thinking?  Absolutely nothing.  All right, Dice.  He's having some trouble.  No, he's fine.  He's fine.  Uh-oh.  Wait, is he putting it down?  Yep.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Why don't you at least hold your cup so you can finish it if you feel the urge?  Dice, you have 25 seconds left. 
[02:55:00]  I don't know.  It's for the my five.  Everyone is moving away from Dice.  Come on, Dice.  You just got to wolf it.  Here he goes.  Just shoot that down.  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice.  Dice is still in, Anthony.  He finished it.  Nice.  It's Pat, Dice, and John.  I haven't heard that chant for 10 years.  And Bing.  There's another.  Pat washing it right down.  Oh! 
[02:55:30]  Was that a puke?  Oh, yes, it was.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was a power boot.  Damn.  Dice is out in the 27th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Dice, good job, though.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Dice.  I'm going to bow out gracefully.  We are extreme.com.  Very good.  There he goes.  Dice made a great effort, Anthony.  It is down to John and Pat.  John and Pat have done their shots already?  They both get a garbage pail.  The first guy to puke loses, obviously, and the other guy gets the MiFi. 
[02:56:00]  We're just down to these two.  The Port of Elections satellite radio.  This is it.  Wow.  Here we go.  Guys, how are you both feeling?  Good enough?  Were you confident that you could win this?  I'm winning.  And Pat?  I'm fine.  Pat?  That's totally fine.  That's a big fuck, man.  Pat came in second place on our last, the Cherry Darts competition, just missed winning  a MiFi.  This time, I mean, he's hell-bent.  But come back.  He is confident he's winning this.  And ding.  28th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Straight cycle arms.  Pat just knocks it right back. 
[02:56:30]  John, Pat.  Very quick second.  Pat.  More eggnog.  Yay.  We don't need that much.  That's all right.  We had to make sure.  We don't need that much, Danny.  That's funny.  Danny, we didn't need more eggnog.  John, you got it down, right?  All right.  They both got it down.  If it's all down, they have their next shot in their hands already.  Hold on.  Interesting.  How many more shots do you guys think you could do?  How many you got?  Pat's feeling no ill effects from this whatsoever.  It might be striking.  Just another day for me.  John, are you feeling any ill effects?  I'm definitely feeling it, but I can keep going. 
[02:57:00]  I think he's playing possum.  He's hurting.  You think he's hurting a little bit?  He's hurting.  All right.  And, John, where are you from again?  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  And Pat's from?  Munaki.  Munaki.  Jersey and Connecticut.  Jersey.  I got diabetes, but I got nine more toes.  Oh, wow.  That wasn't bad, though.  I like him.  He takes a lot of practice swings.  And, guys, look what time it is.  29.  This is how many shots Jim from PA, who's on the phone, thought the winner would do without 
[02:57:30]  puking, by the way.  Wow.  Pat knocks it right back.  John, a little slower drinking than Pat.  Yeah.  Not as big.  It's like a two-gulp thing, three maybe, and then Pat just knocks this back like it's  nothing.  I have not yet begun to drink.  Wow.  All right.  What was that?  29.  That was 29.  That was 29.  We're coming up on our 30th shot.  That is 60 ounces of creamy, thick, viscous, land-o-lakes eggnog. 
[02:58:00]  When Pat's walking down the street, people just point at him and say, there's Pat, the  best there's ever been.  Great.  All right.  We're just coming waiting.  Pat letting off a little steam.  Rumbling from Mount Vesuvius.  And John has a posture to him that looks a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, he's not moving.  As we start the 30th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  30 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Two gulps for Pat. 
[02:58:30]  I'm in the mood for some eggnog.  Thank you.  He just takes that other cup.  Good day to you, sir.  You know, it really makes you appreciate the athleticism of these two when you see how easily  the others were knocked out.  That's the difference between the people that came and might have thought they had a chance  and the true champions in eggnog drinking, Opie.  I'm really amazed that these guys are so above and beyond the guys that have been counted 
[02:59:00]  out.  Pat?  And I didn't think I'd accomplish anything in life but this.  John?  All right.  Oh, man.  John, I'm rooting for you.  I'm getting there.  Don't let this big fuck beat you.  I'm not done yet.  I'm not done yet.  Not done.  Here we go, Anthony.  We're just about ready for the 31st round of the eggnog drinking contest.  You know, I like Pat, but I would like him to be the Susan Lucci of my fives, you know? 
[02:59:30]  Where he's always in it but just can't seem to pull it off kind of thing.  They both got it down pretty easily.  The Buffalo Bills of my fi.  A lot of burping going on.  Size 14.  Size 14.  Size 14.  We haven't played that in a while.  Need some help, would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Pat?  I got nothing.  It puts the eggnog in its belly.  Does this every minute.  She spilled my eggnog.  It's like the lull before the storm, Anthony. 
[03:00:00]  They're just piling up, aren't they?  Oh, it's the Autobahn in the fog.  All right.  Oh, God.  John, head tilted, slightly askew.  He's bent over a little.  Is it hard for you to stand up completely straight now?  I think Pat has him psyched out.  He might.  All right.  There it is.  The 32nd round in the eggnog drinking contest.  Aaron from Texas.  This is what he thought the winner would do without puking, by the way. 
[03:00:30]  Wow.  And right in the hand.  No problem, John?  It's getting there.  Oh, man.  It's getting percolating.  Come on, John.  Hang in there.  Hang in there, John.  Are either of you getting a nauseous feeling?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I'm just starting.  No, just starting to drink.  Right, right.  It's going to be a tough one.  Holy shit.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Texas real fast.  Aaron.  Yeah.  They did 32 shots, no problem. 
[03:01:00]  Yes.  Yes.  That's too much damn eggnog.  I know.  Well, the next guy, Jim from Illinois, can we get him on the line, any of these guys  on the line, or no?  He said that the winner would do 33 shots without puking.  It's like Steve's closet on TV.  Yeah, the big fire on the parkway.  All right, Anthony.  A little low in the action, but we're just about ready for the 33rd round of the eggnog drinking  contest.  There it is.  Yummy.  Pat is just not even waiting. 
[03:01:30]  Pat just chugs it right.  I hate Pat.  Pat, how are you feeling?  Fine.  John?  He is built for this, John.  Yeah.  I might have to give it to him.  I don't know.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  John.  No, John.  John.  John.  John.  John.  John.  Come on, John.  I finished my last one.  I could try another.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Pat has to be feeling confident.  You've got to be feeling confident, Pat.  Yes, I am.  This could be a scenario where Pat is like the Yankees and John is like the Red Sox. 
[03:02:00]  You count them out.  You think it's all over.  Looks pretty much a done deal.  Jim?  Yeah.  From Illinois.  You might be out.  They both did 33 shots.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  One more.  Come on, guys.  One more.  And here we go.  We're just about ready to start the 34th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Jared, by the way, from Maine, who hates Ben, he said that the winner would do 35 shots.  He might be right on.  Maybe.  Pat, no problem once again. 
[03:02:30]  Pat, just putting it right down.  John, having a...  Come on, John.  You have 40, 50 seconds.  You're fine.  Come on, John.  There you go.  You're fine.  There it is.  No problem, John.  John just put another one down.  It's really a little tough.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Say, Jim.  Nice meal.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  We're about to...  We're getting close to the 35th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Jared from Maine.  What's up, Jared?  John not picking up the cup after his...  I think it's coming. 
[03:03:00]  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  You can do it.  Jared.  Oh, boy.  Mm-hmm.  Oh!  Hold on.  Hello.  Another volley.  Another volley of vomit.  Oh!  Another spirit volley of vomit.  Oh, my God.  Humanity.  Oh, my God.  Power booting.  Oh, this is power booting.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, wow. 
[03:03:30]  I am speechless.  Time for another shot.  And Pat wins and puts another one down.  More.  More.  More.  More.  Pat.  Unbelievable.  Pat.  John.  Let's hear it for John.  Wow.  And Pat's drinking another one.  Wait, how many are you up to?  Let's see how many you can do.  More.  More.  How many was that?  37.  That was two after.  37.  37.  This is my victory lap. 
[03:04:00]  All right, let's just keep...  Jared, guess what?  You won the other MiFi.  We'll talk to you in a minute here.  But first, let's say hi to...  Say hi.  Let's say bye to John, I guess.  John and John.  What a great effort.  Three powerful fire hose boots into that garbage pail.  It was stunning, wasn't it?  It was the first one.  Just this powerful fire hose-like nozzle spray of puke.  And then, bam, another.  And then, bam, another.  The worst part was I farted during each one, too. 
[03:04:30]  Did you?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  John.  HopeAnthony.net.  Thanks.  HopeAnthony.net.  What an effort.  What an effort.  There he goes.  John, you represented well today, buddy.  And Pat.  Hey, John, John.  Drinking another one.  Oh, nailed him.  Now just for the hell of it, we're going to see how many shots Pat can do here.  38.  He might finish every single one.  39.  39.  Keep filling him up.  Yeah, let's just keep filling him up.  I'm a little thirsty. 
[03:05:00]  Let's watch the fat guy puke.  I'm a little thirsty.  You've got to give him the minute, though.  You've got to give him the time, right?  Why?  Okay.  Now he's just putting him down like a madman.  Somebody have a blood glucose meter on him?  All right.  You can do it at your pace.  I am at my pace.  You're up to what, 40?  This is 41.  40.  Come on, Al.  You've got to stop.  50 is a nice, even number.  All right.  Let's go for 50.  We'll go for 50.  We're at 41.  You're not really diabetic, are you?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:05:30]  God, if he loses a leg, he gets a mi-fi and a prosthetic.  We could call this the Mabel King commemorative contest.  There goes 42.  That was a little warm.  Uh-oh.  That's the first even hint of a complaint I've heard from Pat.  Yeah.  Could be the turning point.  I do feel my stomach going up into my ribs a little bit.  We just want to set the bar for future contests.  Yeah.  43.  Pat's the heavyweight champion.  What do you got? 
[03:06:00]  This is 40 what?  43.  43 going down.  Well, you're drinking it so fast.  43 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Wow.  No, I know.  What are you thinking, Pat?  It won't be accurate, but...  I'm thinking I can't wait for breakfast.  All right.  Here goes 44.  Yeah?  Anything?  You're looking a little different, though.  A bit peaked.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a winner now.  You won a mi-fi. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Great if he throws up on us.  Yeah.  His shorts out.  Sparks flying out of it.  Puke.  He's taking eggnog out of it.  How many is that, Eric?  This is 45.  45 double shots of eggnog.  Scraping puke.  Off the display.  Yeah.  You know that nice and new smell of electronics is ruined?  You look worried.  His vile stomach.  This is 46.  46.  46.  Double shots of eggnog.  All right.  You've got to get to 50.  Hey, I can pick up your tree. 
[03:07:00]  I've got a nice big van.  Everything out of this guy.  47.  47, Anthony.  47.  Oh, my God.  He's done 12 since the contest ended.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Where am I at?  This is 48.  48.  Two more left, and we'll just call it.  No, I think he should keep calling.  Are you kidding?  Until what?  He won't be able to go.  Until what?  It's up to... 
[03:07:30]  This is 49.  Past 50.  No way.  He's got to go past 50, because if he pukes, then he's actually doing himself a favor.  He'll get all of it out of him.  This is number 50.  I don't think he's going to pukes.  No, he won't.  I don't think he...  It has to.  It doesn't bother him.  He's superhuman.  That's 50?  How does 50 feel?  50 feels like victory.  Just keep going, man.  I'm out of curiosity. 
[03:08:00]  I want to see.  51.  51.  Curiosity?  Hope he would be great in the Third Reich.  No, keep putting these spikes in his head.  Let's see how long it takes for him to pass out.  Sew her legs together while she gives birth.  52.  52?  Pat, what do you think?  I'm slowing down.  All right, good.  All right.  Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat.  He's slowing down.  No, he isn't.  He just sucked that one right down.  And I started my diet today. 
[03:08:30]  Oh.  Jesus, Harry Chapin.  53.  53.  Uh-oh.  Someone's got to figure out how many calories he's done.  Wow, yeah.  How many calories?  Well, it goes up to eight digits.  Uh-oh.  Did you just kind of...  Yeah, he's starting to gurgle right now.  Eric, what are we up to?  This is 54.  54. 
[03:09:00]  Jesus.  He's making everyone else look like a bunch of pussies.  I know.  He laughs at them.  Pat laughs at them.  Isn't he double what some of the guys were out at?  Oh, yeah.  Way.  Pat?  Pat?  He's hands in his pockets.  He's getting uncomfortable.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  All right.  You want to keep going, Pat?  I'll have a couple more.  Yeah, why not?  55.  I'm one for the road.  You'll probably crash soon.  I'm going to put windshield wipers on the inside of my windshield.  Ray on that button, you son of a bitch.  What is this now? 
[03:09:30]  This is 55.  55.  All right.  Every one.  Kenny, what do you think?  That's good for me.  I'm not standing nowhere near him, because when he lets loose, it's going to go across  the studio.  I think it could hit the back window behind Anthony.  Just think of the pressure that stomach's under.  It is.  It's like a big rubber bag all stretched, waiting to squeeze it out.  He's going to have hypervelocity.  He's going to puke.  It's going to keep blacks out of a college in 1964.  I'm just going to roll him out to the sidewalk. 
[03:10:00]  Let's turn the lights back on.  All right.  50 for Kenny.  This is 56.  I think he needs to get to 60.  56 is such a weird number.  Yeah, it is.  56.  What is that?  Pants?  Wow.  What's wrong, Pat?  You're fine.  I'm feeling a little full.  Of course you are.  A little full.  All right.  57.  Three more.  Is he burping?  Space out that garbage can.  No, you won't puke.  You have four more. 
[03:10:30]  You're fine.  We're all starting to like...  I'm starting to look around where I can talk.  It'll be after 60.  What?  It'll be after 60.  Oh, cocky.  Oh, you think?  Oh, look at you being cocky.  58.  Have you ever drank as much eggnog before?  Martini Steve's in the studio.  He's figuring out how many calories with his little calculator.  What's he up to now?  57.  This is 58 right here.  57.  57.  And they're double shots, sweetie.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So how much is one, Steve?  170.  Multiply that by 57.  Thank you, Jim.  58 now.  58 now.  Just add...  Take 57 and add whatever... 
[03:11:00]  Jim, can you stop, please?  20 calories.  All right, Pat.  9,860 so far.  9,000.  Just about 10,000 calories.  This is number 59.  59, Pat.  He's really slowing down.  Yeah.  The face is looking a little different.  How are you feeling?  Getting ready to go.  I want more.  Oh, boy.  All right, here's 60. 
[03:11:30]  That's the first one he hasn't shot.  Now it's really slow.  But he's also not doing it in a minute.  He would probably do more if he had a minute in between each one.  Yeah, maybe.  Pat, what do you think?  Ready to go.  Pretty soon.  If you do 60, I think you could do 62.  Nah, 62.  Don't make him go up at 62.  62 is fine.  Yeah, 62.  Have you ever drank it?  This is 61.  Yeah, you can do two more.  Yeah, two more and then.  What are you, a gay?  What are you, a girl?  Come on.  Come on, eggnog dick.  Oh, he's really slowing down. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  That's not done.  He didn't finish it.  That's not done.  Yeah, you didn't finish that.  That's not done, kid.  What's wrong with you?  60 what?  61.  61?  62.  Oh, 62.  Yes.  Oh, oh.  He's not really.  Uh-oh.  He's like William Holden looking at the coffee table.  Oh, my God.  He just slammed 62.  Well, if you do 62, I think you could do what?  63, Jim?  I can't bend over to puke.  Uh-oh.  Someone better light a fire over here.  Someone's moving.  Someone better raise that fucking garbage can, man. 
[03:12:30]  Look, dude.  If you did 62, you could do 63.  I mean, come on.  It's only one more.  What do you think, Pat?  Ugh.  There has to be a grand finale.  Pat, almost 63.  Doubled.  Yeah, there has to be a grand finale.  You can't just walk out after 62.  Such an odd number.  It really is.  All right.  Here goes Pat.  63.  Maybe he needs some encouragement, everyone, in the studio.  Let's go, Pat.  Yeah.  63.  Don't move. 
[03:13:00]  He won't puke.  He's fine.  Pat, what do you think?  He's fine.  There's no more room at the inn.  Wow.  Sold out?  All right.  What are we up to here?  This is 64.  64.  Done.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean, Pat?  You can't just walk out after 63.  65.  Double shot.  It's such a good number.  I'm going to explode.  You want a donut?  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be like from the Monty Python movie. 
[03:13:30]  Waffleton.  Waffleton.  Waffleton.  Waffleton.  Mr. Creoset.  I have to write ta-ta with the wrong ho-ho, Pat.  Well, Pat, what do you think?  I'm getting gas.  Gas pains now.  Uh-oh.  Gas pains.  Oh, please shit your pants.  All right.  64.  I mean, he's so close to 65.  65 is that number.  65 is his max.  He can't go over 65.  That's his max.  Yeah, I don't think.  I think he's a pussy.  He can't go over 65.  He certainly can.  No, he can't.  No, 65.  That's a fine number to stop him.  Oh, wow.  Hey, they're cheering outside. 
[03:14:00]  They want 70.  70 is such an even number, I think.  65.  Be happy with 65.  I don't know.  They want 70 outside.  The other contestants want 70.  Well, actually, BJ puked.  He's fine.  Yeah, BJ's fine.  Look at him.  He's smiling.  What is he up to, Eric?  This is 65.  65?  65 double shots of eggnog.  How many calories is he up to?  Well over 10,000 now.  Yeah.  I think there's a point where I have to make myself puke.  Uh-oh.  No.  Yeah, you might have to.  Yeah, you might have to.  You've got to get rid of that stuff. 
[03:14:30]  11,050.  Oh, no.  He has raised his two fingers, Anthony.  Are you 66?  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  What do I win?  66.  You're going to puke it out.  The respect of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're the champ.  Here he goes.  66.  Dude, you're raising the bar for a future contest here.  66 down.  66.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I have to make myself.  Yeah, you might have to make yourself.  You better go before 67. 
[03:15:00]  I say you.  It's like a valve.  It's going in, but it ain't coming out.  Pat, I say you do 70 and then you make yourself puke.  I think everyone would like to see that, right?  This is 67 right here.  67 double shots of eggnog.  Holy shit.  Only three more in there.  Only three more.  That's okay?  That was 67.  Easy.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he's getting 20 pounds in front of our eyes, man.  All right.  Here comes 68.  68.  What are you thinking, man? 
[03:15:30]  You're studying him.  I don't know what to think.  68 double shots.  You're sweating sweat.  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus, Eric.  Just have him puke.  Well, no.  He's got to get to 70.  69.  No.  He's got to get to 70.  No.  I say stop.  He's got to get to 70.  You should stop him.  What do you want, Pat?  You want to walk away?  I'm going to walk away.  After 68 or...  It doesn't matter.  If he pukes, 69 or 70, it's all coming out.  69.  69 done. 
[03:16:00]  70.  An even 70 shot.  That's it.  No more, dude.  No more.  Wow.  All right.  Let it up.  70 double shots.  Eggnog from Pat.  You's doubled with the other guy.  From Monaki, New Jersey.  Representing.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  We're in the trailer park.  What do you want to do?  I want two.  All right.  Then you'd better do that.  Why don't you lift those two fingers up?  He's lifting his two fingers up.  Oh, boy.  That's all right.  We've got to do it.  Here we go.  He's got three fingers in his mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  This is Pat from Monaki, Anthony. 
[03:16:30]  This...  That was just a warm-up.  That's two shots.  That was a warm-up.  That was a half-gallon on the inside.  All right.  Everyone, listen.  Listen.  Listen.  I'm a star.  Eric's running out. 
[03:17:00]  He's going to puke also.  Eric's going to...  Eric.  Come on.  Eric's puking.  How much eggnog is coming out of this guy?  Wow.  I've never seen so much eggnog come...  Get me a bucket.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, thank you.  I can't lift any harder.  Oh, my God.  There's no way more is going to come out of this guy.  Is that it, Pat?  No.  It's 12,000 calories.  Bad days to start a diet.  Oh, my God. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Maybe he can get his name as puke shots.  All done.  Oh, you're done?  Yeah.  Pat from Monarcha, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Wow.  Was that a marathon puke?  How do you feel, man?  You all right?  I feel better now.  Of course.  Holy S.  He did 70 double shots of eggnog.  He got it out, too.  He got most of that out.  Oh, yeah.  That was a lot.  Well, Pat's can't.  It's pretty heavy. 
[03:18:30]  That bucket's, like, swimming.  Make Eric take that out.  I think Eric should have to carry that.  Eric vomited.  Eric vomited.  How are you, Eric?  Can't speak.  Eric, take those buckets out.  Uh-oh.  Take that bucket out.  Eric.  Smell it.  Darren, get Eric on mic.  Eric, what's up?  No, no, no.  What's the matter?  I'm going to throw up.  No, you're not.  You're fine.  Smell that wonderful puke smell.  Just, Eric, be careful.  Listen to that slosh around in there, Eric. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I was laughing so hard.  I couldn't breathe.  Hey, I'll give somebody 10 bucks to smell Pat's two fingers.  All right.  High five.  Oh, Kathy.  All right, Pat, congratulations.  You won the my five.  Thank you.  Oh, it does smell it.  Now I smell it.  Notice Ben hasn't been around.  Of course not.  Because Ben hates this stuff.  Where is he?  He's combing his hair with a hammer.  No, it's kooking fucking.  My premise behind him.  Wow.  It doesn't reek in here now. 
[03:19:30]  That was 4.3 gallons at 12,000 calories.  Nice.  You drank 4.3.  Not gallons.  4.3 gallons.  You sure?  Yeah.  4 ounces per cup.  70 cups.  4 ounces per cup.  Do some more math, Steve.  Okay.  I thought it was 2 ounces per cup.  It should be about 2 ounces.  Two shots.  There's no way the guy did 4.3 gallons.  You know, Steve.  Even 2 gallons would be crazy. 
[03:20:00]  It's 2 shots.  2 shots.  2 gallons.  It was 2 gallons, but it's still 12,000 calories.  A little over 2 gallons of eggnog from Pat.  All right, Pat.  We've got to give him something extra for doing all this.  He did an extra 35 shots.  He's double.  He did.  I don't know what we can give him.  We'll give him a t-shirt or something.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we get everyone out of the studio?  Pat is the winner of the eggnog drinking contest.  Congratulations.  Pat, any parting words?  Pat?  Parting words?  Yeah, Pat.  What do you want to say?  You want to say one?  I feel like the biggest loser. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, geez.  Thank you, Pat.  Thank you.  Great job, Mike.  Go away.  Pete from Connecticut online.  Yes, Pete.  Yeah, do I want to mind if I get 27 awful jokes by the end of the eggnog?  27 awful Pat jokes.  Very good.  Thank you, Pete.  Pete from Connecticut.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York City.  Eric, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Good morning there, sweet tit.  Hi there, Angel.  I have a good puke story for you.  All right.  I'm three months into dating my girlfriend. 
[03:21:00]  And I'm trying to get laid and get invited to a wedding.  Get really drunk.  Where are you calling from?  A nuclear reactor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to cut our losses there.  Brian from Long Island.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Syndication how?  Hey, I just wanted to say 70 shots.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Yeah, it was definitely insane.  I cannot believe the guy just did 70 double shots of eggnog. 
[03:21:30]  Hey, where's Jared?  Remember Jared?  Oh, yeah.  Who hates Ben?  He ends up winning the other MyFy.  He guessed.  He was closest to how many shots?  40, right?  I think he was right on the button.  He said 35, I think.  35.  He did win.  He did win.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Jared, give us a call back.  You won the other MyFy today.  That'd be funny.  Watching him stick his whole fist down his throat like that and just gurgling.  It's probably better for him that he puked out.  Without a doubt.  That's why I wanted him to keep going because if that's settled in, I think he would have  major problems later today. 
[03:22:00]  I was actually getting worried about him.  I'm like, dude, he's diabetic, man.  I don't want to see if he gets...  How funny it would have been if he went into diabetic shock.  Hilarious.  We could all teabag them, all the ambulance was on its way.  Eric, are you feeling better?  Starting to, yeah.  It really stunk, though, man.  That's sloshing vomit.  Oh, my God.  Did you get a whiff of that, dude?  Dude, how hard were you laughing?  Oh, that's too goddamn funny. 
[03:22:30]  How many times did he power booze?  Like 10 times?  It's got to be 10, and it was liquid.  Did that pill get used?  Yes.  No.  Shut up, Jimmy.  All right, Jared.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, Jared?  I won a MiFi.  Yes, you did.  After all that, you won the other MiFi today.  Awesome.  So I guess we'll get some info from you, so stay on the line, okay?  I already got the info.  Oh, you do?  All right, congratulations.  Anything you want to say to Ben?  Ben, you're not a dick. 
[03:23:00]  Ben is kind of a dick because he blew off the whole contest.  He's a computer in there.  Is that the computer?  He's probably answering your stupid emails.  Yeah, bring...  Let's get Ben in here.  There's no puke in here.  He can come back into the studio.  Ben.  I made a mistake, too.  I only sent, like, 11 emails to Steve.  All right.  What is he saying?  He's saying no.  He's not coming in.  He said he's doing stuff.  Yeah, Ben has a serious problem with...  Oh, that's right.  He wasn't in here the whole time.  No, he ran out as soon as the contest started. 
[03:23:30]  He went to screen the call.  I think he's got to be in here for these contests.  You're the boss open.  I think that, you know, you and Ed can put your feet down.  He should.  All right, Jared.  Congratulations.  You won the other MiFi from Maine.  I appreciate it, guys.  I look forward to coming to the show, and you rock, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  There he goes.  Jared from Maine.  Are we getting rid of all these people out here?  I would say if they want to hang for the extra time, we're almost done.  Yeah.  They're probably going to want to take pictures and stuff like that, probably.  Okay.  The gurgling, splashing sounds of vomit. 
[03:24:00]  Well, you need a rowboat going...  A motorboat.  A rowboat.  Fucking asshole, I am.  A rowboat.  Row, row.  You stink.  Rowboat.  Ah, I can't find the clip.  Shut up.  A rowboat.  It was stink.  All right.  XM202.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Lo mas mal de O.P. and Anthony en XM2. 
[03:24:30]  Zero dos.  Well, Pat from Munaki's here, guys.  Yes, we've been looking at him out the window the whole time.  And he brought Steve a present.  Yeah.  A present.  You want to show everybody what Pat from Munaki brought you?  We'll describe it for the radio.  Pat from Munaki.  Now he's a big star on the message board on Wackbag.  He's a big star.  He's got his own thread going and everything. 
[03:25:00]  Pat from Munaki.  We couldn't even get him in the other day.  We had to, like, get him a couple days in advance, book him.  Oh, I know.  He had to be booked.  Availability.  We had to check his availability.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There it is, Steve.  Well, should we bring Pat from Munaki in here?  Bring Pat in.  All right, Steve.  Go to that mic, then.  Yeah.  Lift that mic up.  All right.  Over there.  Over there.  Oh, well.  Here's Pat from Munaki.  How you doing, Pat?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Oh, good, good. 
[03:25:30]  Get closer to the mic.  There it is.  All righty.  All right.  Closer to the mic.  Feel a little gay right now.  These guys love you for some reason.  I don't get it.  I got to be honest.  I don't get the whole Pat from Munaki.  How can you not get it?  But a lot of people, they say it's their new favorite thing on the O.P. and Anthony program.  So, Pat?  Yes?  You were the winner of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[03:26:00]  Of course, here's the winning audio when you finally had a puke.  Oh, my God.  I don't think you can hear it.  Well, I'm not playing for him.  Right?  And since that famous appearance, these guys have been obsessed with you.  That's his little...  I love his little comments.  His little jokes.  They're just the best.  Comes up and just right off the cuff will come out with a funny little line. 
[03:26:30]  Is this one of your comments, talking about the morning show?  Yes.  You said this outside?  Yes, I did.  And what is it?  I chinked there in trouble.  I chinked there in trouble.  That's outrageous.  Ovaltine.  Shouldn't it be called round-teen?  The glass is round.  Well, what are you going to do?  The big smile comes on, the little smirk like that. 
[03:27:00]  I tried.  I gave it a go.  My dogs are barking.  I've got to be in it to win it.  Now I know what that means.  The car crash.  Yes, it's the car crash.  Pat, you've been on Wackbag and posting things.  One thing you posted was a picture of his foot right before and after they lopped his toe off because of diabetes. 
[03:27:30]  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  One of his toes.  Now, sort of like that.  He's doing the old pull your finger off your hand gag, which is a sight gag, but...  Grass, anyway.  That looks awful.  So, yeah, you lost a toe.  Yeah, I'm hoping to find it somewhere.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, my God. 
[03:28:00]  He's awful.  That's not bad.  Let's see.  Yeah.  One of the...  Are you reading one of his posts?  Not really.  It's about what he eats.  Like, they've whittled you down on the message board now where you have to explain to people what you eat because they were yelling at you for drinking so much eggnog.  You deserve to have your arms and legs cut off.  Yeah, some people are saying you deserve to just be a head.  Can he read his post?  Maybe Pat can read his own post if you have a post because this way people can hear him read what he wrote.  All right.  Yeah.  What did the guy write to you, Pat, first? 
[03:28:30]  He wrote, holy shit, I'm a diabetic.  You just scared the fuck out of me.  You're a fucking idiot.  I don't even drink because I'm...  I don't want to lose a toe and you do 70 shots of eggnog.  A lot of diabetics, well, I'll just say, were very angry with you for coming in here and doing so much eggnog,  which has a lot of sugar in it, and thinking that you were stupid for doing that.  Yeah, well, my point was I threw most of it up.  Right.  What was your e-mail response?  Oh, my e-roll.  Wait, wait, continue, though. 
[03:29:00]  Easy there, Sparky.  First of all, I peed...  No, no, no, continue with the...  Oh, okay.  You could have gone into a diabetic coma during the show.  Did you even take insulin before the contest?  What a moron.  You deserve to lose a toe.  Hmm, huh, hmm, see my toe?  Hmm, huh, now you don't.  He wrote that?  Well, I guess he did.  What did you respond?  He actually wrote that.  I responded, easy there, Sparky.  First of all, I puked almost all of it up.  See video.  Secondly, since my toe was chopped off, my daily diet consists of 12 ounces of tea, 
[03:29:30]  everything sweetened with Splenda, of course,  four eggs for breakfast, two chicken breast halves,  and five cups of spinach for dinner.  Thirdly, about once a week, I go to a movie and have a large popcorn with butter and a Diet Coke.  And, uh...  Fourthly.  Fourthly, I go out maybe ten times a year, mostly O&A-related stuff,  Belmar, Hammerstein, the downtown, Cherry Darts, Brian Regan, eggnock contest, etc. 
[03:30:00]  Fifthly, those few times I go out, I'll do whatever the fuck I want.  You're right.  I did deserve to lose my toe.  My sugar was 465 when I went in the hospital, and it was high for a long time.  Currently, my sugar is between 100 and 200.  Not bad, since I have no health insurance.  Complications occur when it's out of control for a long time.  That's the type 2 version, that is.  And if I lose anything else, I'll deserve that.  Sixthly, hey, I want a MiFi. 
[03:30:30]  Whee!  Whee.  Isn't that what one of the little piggies said?  Whee, whee, all the way.  Which one got cut off?  Whee, whee, whee, all the way to the dumpster.  My fourth...  Yeah, that's what I call the ring toe.  The ring toe?  The fourth one on the...  Oh, man, can I see that?  That was a little piggies that stayed home.  All right, let's see the toe.  How long ago did you have this hacked off?  It was...  First, I noticed a little redness in the toe.  Okay, yeah, give me the buildup.  I learned not to trim your toenails with a butter knife after that. 
[03:31:00]  Which is true.  What do you mean?  Why a butter knife?  I didn't have a nail clipper.  Butter?  I don't even know her.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Man, man.  What are you going to do?  I'm trying to balance myself.  Oh, he's going to fall.  That's rough.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  Looks like Fred Flintstone over here.  Holy...  Wow.  Let's see.  I don't know...  I don't even know what to say. 
[03:31:30]  Where's that picture up on whackbag.com?  Oh, dude.  It is so heinous.  It's right after the...  It's in the hospital room.  It's right after the operation, and it looks like someone took a hatchet.  They didn't even suture it up.  They didn't suture it up, and it closes naturally.  It looked like a hatchet wound.  You know...  Like they took an axe and put it between his toes.  It's more a wow, and I'll tell you why.  I'm not grossed out, because they did a...  I don't know.  It healed great.  It just looks like...  It looks...  Yeah.  I mean, he has four toes, but it looks very natural in a weird way.  One, two, three, four.  No, I understand, but I thought there'd be a huge... 
[03:32:00]  I thought there'd be a huge space in between the toes or something, and it's...  Yeah, there was that right after, but it sort of...  Yeah, it's like a cartoon character.  That's pretty wild.  Is your balance off?  No, I was worried that it might be, because I'm holding up a lot of weight here, and...  No, no, it's fine.  Fine?  Yeah.  All right, well, you brought Martini Steve a little present.  Yes, he did.  I wanted to describe your present, Steve, for everybody.  I saw those in a big and tall casual mail.  Uh-huh.  Big and tall casual mail?  Is that where you shop? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, these are big dogs' boxer shorts with flames and hot rod in flame writing on the back.  Oh, hot rod.  Yeah.  Right on your ass.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, like, insert here.  And, uh...  Hot rod on a warm bear.  Oh, oh, oh, I...  I'm going to wear the button now.  And, you know, I...  Thank you, Pat.  I had no idea they made things like this.  You know, I have this aficionado for... 
[03:33:00]  Aficionado.  I suck today.  Are you all right?  Affinity, wrong company.  Oh, wait, Lionel Richie is going to talk about these on...  Affinity.  Working for XM now.  I have this affinity for flame clothing, and I'm not even aware that half this stuff exists,  so I appreciate it.  Thank you very much, Pat.  So, are you going to wear those?  Not right now, but yes, I will.  You'd wear them around the house, maybe?  Yeah, around the house.  This is like sleeping in boxers, because they're very...  The material's very thick.  I can imagine you sweat a lot in these.  Why do you sleep in boxers?  As opposed to... 
[03:33:30]  Naked.  Mude.  You know?  I sleep naked.  What is he going...  No, it's not...  No, thanks.  Is it true you brought other things?  Oh, pastries.  Oh, pastries.  Pastries.  You've been eating any of those?  Steve requested.  It was actually said half in jest, and he actually showed up with them, so that was  very cool.  You aren't eating those?  No.  I usually...  Last time I had them put the string over the box to keep me from getting to them.  All right.  Tied it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you'd dig right in. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because they're even shaped like little toes.  You don't eat one of those.  Little cannoli.  All right.  All right.  I'm sort of starting to get it.  You're warming up to him.  I'm getting it.  All right.  I'm lovable.  He's lovable.  Any other things you want to get off your chest there?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Anything in the news?  Anything in the news?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  No.  I guess I'll have to watch the news now. 
[03:34:30]  He's got nothing.  He's got nothing.  What is this now?  This is Philbin Transport.  Oh, that's me.  I figured I could go to Washington, D.C. for...  Your sound machine won't end up on the other side of the country.  Take it door-to-door, direct.  What do you transport now?  Only you don't transport...  Anything.  Anything that will fit in a van.  Oh, okay.  Products.  Yeah.  That's your job?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So if something has to go from point A to point B, you're the man to call.  Yes.  Instead of like FedEx or UPS. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, FedEx, they could track it so you'll know it's in New Orleans.  Yeah.  In the wrong place.  Right.  And they're annoying, though, with their planes and stuff like that.  I'd rather have just you in a van.  Oh, yeah.  Like, 95.  Just drive it there.  What the hell?  Yeah, as long as I don't tell a joke, I won't crash.  And you, uh, there's no tracking the package when it's with...  No.  So the guy can't look and say, oh, he's in front of ONA's studio again.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you got my phone number.  You can call me.  I'm on the road.  That's pretty much good.  Yeah.  We're tracking.  Hello, Pat.  Where are you? 
[03:35:30]  It's here.  All right.  Right here.  Well, Kevin in Brooklyn has something.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hey, did Pat go to the hospital and ambulance?  Or a tow truck?  A tow truck.  What's my...  Pat didn't hear him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Drew, give him the headphones for a little bit.  We'll get to Drew next.  Cigars and Scotch.  What's going on?  Hey.  That last joke Pat told, it's only totals.  Totals. 
[03:36:00]  Totals.  Cigars and Scotch.  This guy posts on Whackbag, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's actually funny.  They post some really funny stuff.  All right.  Cool.  Whackbag.com.  All right, Pat.  I don't know.  You can hang out there for a little bit.  We'll have you back in for the rest of the show.  I told my dogs that I'd bring them home a treat from the hospital, but they wouldn't let  me keep the toe.  Ow.  Neck brace.  Well, what are you going to do?  Ow.  Neck brace.  Hey, I threw it out there.  Like the eggnog.  It was all done. 
[03:36:30]  In a good nature kind of way.  You know, happy.  I hope this fog lifts.  Can I ask if you own your own business, why don't you insure yourself so you have health  insurance?  Because it costs a lot of money.  Okay.  Makes perfect sense.  Fair enough.  Yeah, there you go.  I had to buy my fire.  No, you won a my fire.  You won a tow, anyway. 
[03:37:00]  Wow, they're just piling up.  Yeah, they really are.  All right.  There he goes.  Pat from Monaki.  Always a pleasure.  Thank you, Pat.  You could limp your way out and take a seat.  We'll have you back in.  Yeah.  Oh, Pat, Pat.  Yes?  Oh.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Steve brought me a note.  I have to interject.  Pat said this.  I hope I didn't sound fat.  I hear the radio adds 10 pounds.  But you've got to go.  Wow.  No, when he has these little ditties, he's got to walk in with them.  All right.  That's true. 
[03:37:30]  That's the beauty of him being here.  Because eventually we will just put them all together.  And Pat didn't hear us.  So, Pat, come on in here.  Really fast.  I know you're fat, but move fast for us, please.  Get over there and say what you just wrote down for Steve.  Oh, I was hoping I didn't sound fat, because I hear the radio puts 100 pounds on you.  His fingers are going.  Well.  I don't like the way you amended it.  It went from 10 to 100.  Yes.  It's not funny now.  Look at the radio at 100 pounds. 
[03:38:00]  Because that's not possible.  That's way too exaggerated.  10 pounds would be like the norm.  I'm not a big fan of exaggerated humor.  No.  If it's slightly exaggerated, like 10 pounds, nice.  100 pounds, what?  150,000 isn't a lot of money.  It should have been $10 isn't a lot of money.  Yeah.  When you don't have health insurance, like me.  It's tragedy, but I turn tragedy into something.  Of course, an arm and a toe.  All right, Pat.  You turn tragedy into blank stares.  You sure do. 
[03:38:30]  Get him out of here.  Thank you, Pat.  There he goes.  Oh, he's rushing off.  Get a lot of exercise.  All right.  Finally, Anthony.  He's awful.  Did you see his little fingers moving?  His fingers move.  I swear to God, he almost said, my chickadee.  Ah, yes.  I go from enjoying him to hating him really fast.  I seem to have lost a toe somewhere.  WC, whale cow.  People can't decide what I look like.  Get out of here, toe.  You bother me. 
[03:39:00]  Never work with animals, children, or all your toes.  I believe I'll have another eggnog.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Apparently, Pat from Unaki, who is here today, told a joke in California.  In Los Feliz, California.  Because all I'm seeing is a big train wreck.  Pat, any final words? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, Pat.  What do you got to say?  See Gene Simmons on American Idol?  Oh, yes, we did.  Didn't he look like he was trying to pick up on those broads with that creepy stare of his?  Good stare.  You ever see the movie, Wanted Dead or Alive?  Yeah.  When they put the grenade in his mouth, and you just want to pull that pin?  Or not?  No, the dead stare worked well on radio.  Yeah.  I don't understand.  I was talking to Johnny Carson Sunday morning, and I was telling him a joke, and all of a 
[03:40:00]  sudden, I didn't hear anything anymore.  Wow.  I hear Carter Peterson, he's going to do a news show up in heaven.  Oh, what's it called?  No, he's going to be the anchor.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Here's O.P. and Anthony.  When they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you. 
[03:40:30]  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I'm the only one that didn't get to take a leak.  This break was so short, no one's back from the break yet.  I guess O.P. and Jimmy's still in the bathroom.  And I was walking out, ready to take a leak.  I forgot, and a good thing, I forgot the key to the men's room.  I figured it would be open, like Jimmy or O.P. would have left it open or something.  No.  So I walk up, and I go back to get the key, and Eric tells me, hey, we're back on the air. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, wow.  So I don't get to take a leak.  No one's here in the studio.  It's like, you guys are back on the air.  Yeah.  So I have to run in, still bladder full of urine.  Well, O.P. just, we were just chatting in the bathroom, talking about my dumb Chicago flight.  He's like, do you think I got time to take a dump?  Oh, no.  Right now.  He's taking a dump in there?  Stupid is on the ball, so I waited for a couple of seconds, and I felt like he settled in,  and I just shut the lights off and walked out of the bathroom.  That's what you do.  So I'm hoping he's right now duck walking with a log hanging out, trying to get the lights  back on. 
[03:41:30]  Yesterday, we all went to the bathroom together, as we sometimes do.  And Jimmy, notorious for turning the lights out when we're in there.  Credit where it's due.  It's a great gag.  The bathrooms are pitch black in buildings.  You know, rarely have a window in there.  The thing can open in five-degree weather.  So I'm just about done, and the light goes out, and I'm used to it.  But I didn't know there was anybody else in there, and there was some guy just from the  building, and he's sitting in the stall, and you just hear, hey, turn the light back 
[03:42:00]  on.  And there he is, just dumping in the dark.  When I was doing Last Comic Standing in New York, we were doing the semifinals.  I went into the bathroom, and I got somebody so good.  That was shot in a hotel on, like, 50-something Street, the Hudson Hotel.  And I got this.  I shut the lights off in the men's room, and I walked out, and this guy was screaming in  the hotel.  It was like a big lobby.  Who the fuck turned off the lights?  Somebody turned off the fucking lights!  He was as angry as I've ever seen anybody about anything. 
[03:42:30]  And there's, like, a bunch of people in the hallway.  He was screaming.  Dude, I got the aftermath, though.  So I'm in this stall, dumping, and there's another guy dumping, and you turn off the  light.  Just now?  Yeah.  I know the gag, and I'm just like, ugh.  Who cares?  Because he's done it a million times, right?  This guy obviously was reading, like, it had to be the New York Times, because all you  hear is, give me the papers.  Give me the papers.  I need the papers.  I don't want to mess with you.  Papers, Eva. 
[03:43:00]  I have nowhere to slam this, but basically all you hear is, son!  Slams the paper down.  You hear a belt.  And then he waddles out.  A clanking of the dump belt.  He waddles out of the stall, and he, yeah, he doesn't have the, the belt is, yeah, whatever.  Clanging.  Clanging, thank you.  And he clangs past me, turns the light on, and goes back, and then you hear, with the  paper, and he goes back into position.  Well, you know, when he sat back down, and his cheeks opened up, it was probably like 
[03:43:30]  chewed bubble gum, because you know he didn't wipe, he just jumped up.  He couldn't do the duck walk all the way over to the light switch.  It was really funny, because I'm like, ugh, whatever.  Just sit there and take it, duty boy.  Annoying.  Good thing it wasn't Ben.  And then, oh, and then stupid Stalker Patty's outside the studio.  You know, you're back on the radio, and they're talking about you.  You're back on the, I think you'd need to be back in the studio.  You know, I think Anthony could handle it by himself. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, I could handle it if I didn't have to piss so badly.  I went up to go to the bathroom, and I forgot the key, which is a good thing, or all three  of us would have been in there, and nobody would have been here to return to the program.  It'd be funny if we came back, and it was the Eric and Derek show, and they wouldn't  let us in.  All of a sudden, it was a big hit.  Ah!  Great story for E.T.  We're out of a job.  Opie and Anthony, they are like chocoholics, but for booze.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ow.  Ow. 
[03:44:30]  Hey.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Hey.  Ah.  Ah.  Yes.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, fuck.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Whoa, wah, wah, wah.  Ugh.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Hey.  What the hell's going on here?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people. 
[03:45:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the end.  What are you talking about?  Of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, okay.  Catch Opie and Anthony live from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern with replays throughout the day  on XM 202. </pre>
