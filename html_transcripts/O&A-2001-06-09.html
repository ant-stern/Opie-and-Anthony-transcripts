<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a furious dressing-down from station executive Ken Stevens.  He vehemently condemned their repeated rule violations, specifically citing their disregard for the policy prohibiting on-air discussion of other personalities and their mocking of the company's sexual harassment training video, in which Stevens himself appeared.  He repeatedly threatened their jobs.  The reprimand transitioned into a discussion of a prior incident in Boston that necessitated a trip to Washington D.C. to meet with a superior.  The hosts then moved on to Anthony's incredibly long commute from his newly-moved-to home in Sloatsburg, New York.  Anthony, along with his girlfriend Erica (who called in), detailed the impracticality and comedic absurdity of the move, highlighting Erica's displeasure with the decision and the significant financial strain it imposed.

The show next shifted focus to a critique of Super Bowl commercials, specifically lampooning those featuring Christopher Reeve and Muhammad Ali.  Listener feedback and humorous anecdotes enriched this segment.  Comedian Brian Regan joined the show in studio towards the end of this section, performing stand-up routines about donut shops and fold-out couches.  Numerous callers contributed to the discussion throughout this portion.  The conversation with Brian Regan continued after the commercial break, focusing on value pricing at a donut shop and the confusing pricing schemes employed.  The hosts and Regan discussed his career, including listener anecdotes about his shows and the sometimes bizarre signs they brought (like "Eat Rats").  A caller inquired about Regan's appearance in a Coca-Cola commercial, while another asked about microwaving Pop-Tarts, prompting a humorous tangent from Regan.

The show then took a drastically inappropriate turn with the arrival of Sandy, a woman who engaged in extremely vulgar and sexually explicit conversation with the hosts and a caller named Bill.  Bill proceeded to apply Preparation H to Sandy's hemorrhoid live on air, while Sandy remained mostly undressed and continued to participate in the crude banter.  Additional calls followed, one detailing a bizarre coffee shop injury involving a broken toilet seat and a subsequent lawsuit.  Several prank calls featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonations, specifically Detective John Kimball, were played throughout this segment, targeting various businesses like Cotton's Barbecue, Preferred Realty, and Hooters, with the calls characterized by aggressive and vulgar exchanges.  These audio clips were promoted as available on FoundryMusic.com.

Later, Andrew Dice Clay called in, engaging in a protracted, nonsensical exchange centered around the repeated, bizarre question, "Which way? Medium or well done?"  The conversation included sexually explicit and vulgar jokes and references, a dispute over the origin of slang terms like "yambag" and "butt butter," and various discussions on relationships and sex.  The hosts then spoke with Carlos Mencia.  Their conversation centered on his comedy, his use of racial humor, and the challenges of stand-up comedy in the context of increasing political correctness. Mencia discussed instances where he'd been asked not to perform certain jokes, particularly those involving race, expressing frustration with limitations placed on his comedic freedom.  He shared numerous anecdotes about his life, family, and experiences with different ethnic groups, frequently employing racial slurs and offensive language. This included stories about his large family, a childhood shooting incident, and his father's blunt humor.  He recounted experiences with a white contractor and Hispanic laborers, a car window-breaking incident to help someone locked out of a car, and differing cultural approaches to complaints.  Mencia concluded by promoting his CD, "Take a Joke America."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of O.B. and N.B.  1027 WNEW  All right.  Oh, man.  All right, yeah.  What?  What?  I thought we were all just having fun, right?  What happened?  All right, we will let you in on what we just had to listen to for the last 10 minutes, 
[00:00:30]  okay?  This is a reenactment.  I thought we were clear on what we weren't going to be doing on this program.  How much more clear do we have to be?  You boys can't be doing that.  I've said it a thousand times.  Look, we think you're very talented.  You're going to go far in this company.  You're doing very well for the station and for the company.  But God damn, we would throw you out faster than Crackley or Goose 
[00:01:00]  if you don't knock this off.  Why are you too stupid?  You are stupid.  Stupid.  We make policy for reasons around here.  Not to be broken by the likes of you  so we can play Van Halen more than Q104.  Well, I've got to explain it to everyone.  When they run out of dump time, 
[00:01:30]  when we're being bad,  they turn off the station and they go to the  Ain't Talking About Love song.  How the hell do you run out of dump time  when you're on a dump as long as you?  Unless you're blatantly breaking face of policy.  Allow me to reiterate.  I'm Ken Stevens.  Effective immediately.  I'm making station policy.  No one discusses any other infinitive station  or air personality in any way.  Not even as a comedy little bit that you do on your program. 
[00:02:00]  If you have a problem, see me.  Ken Stevens.  It's not me because I'm the other guy down in Washington.  I just punch up on the telephone every time  and get nauseated  with your blatant disrespect of face of policy.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  I go down the hall.  I'm like, well, what's the problem? 
[00:02:30]  I just get a memo in my face.  Not a word.  Just a memo.  Comes flying at me.  I don't get it.  Don't forget the sexual harassment video.  Yeah, Mark, look.  I heard you watch the sexual harassment video  that our company put together  at great cost and effort  to teach everyone who works for this company 
[00:03:00]  about sexual harassment  and how to avoid it in the workplace.  And I hear you boys just laughing at it.  Ha, ha, laugh, laugh, laugh your ass off.  You'll be laughing out the door  all the way to the unemployment line.  We had station employees acting the roles  and you were making fun of bad acting.  Did you happen to see who was playing  the guy behind the computer  whacking it to the point? 
[00:03:30]  That was me.  I thought I did an Emmy award-winning appearance.  You boys break every rule  and make fun of the goddamn  sexual harassment video.  Didn't you see when I pulled that girl's head  into my lap?  That was sexual harassment.  I was doing that purely  for the videotape  to teach you  and you mocked it.  Now look,  you boys are very talented. 
[00:04:00]  We like you.  We wouldn't have taken you  aboard this company  if we didn't think  you could go very far.  But you gotta tell the line!  You boys don't understand the rules!  We will throw you out!  Wait, my other phone's ringing.  Hold on.  Hello?  No, I don't know  what the hell I do here. 
[00:04:30]  Okay.  Hello, boys!  Hi.  Fly straight!  I don't understand you, boys.  Straight and narrow  and you'll go far.  You'll be with this company  a long time  like Dan Rather.  If I here ain't talking  about love one more time,  I swear to God  you're out the door.  Okay.  All right, boys.  Wait, wait. 
[00:05:00]  I don't get it.  What?  I didn't say anything.  What are you, nuts?  I didn't say anything.  It's just my deep voice guy.  It's the Ivan in the Afternoon program.  No, no, no.  What?  What?  You ever heard Ivan in the Afternoon?  No, I haven't.  It's a funny show.  I haven't heard Ivan in it. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  He's got a brother, Phil, in Montana.  He makes dip.  He wears a derby  and a bolo tie.  That's it.  That's great.  I've heard of Spike and the Angry Wolf.  They do a good afternoon drive show.  What we have here is a failure to communicate.  Oh, boy. 
[00:06:00]  I'm waiting to hear that from the guy.  What we've got here is failure to communicate.  Now, you boys are on a long career with our organization.  Look how long Dan and Radha's been with us.  Look how long he's been on that.  He's been dead 10 years.  He's still welcome in the company.  But we like him.  He doesn't make fun of anybody else.  And we want you boys to die here, too. 
[00:06:30]  Sooner than later, for the love of God.  I should have known when we hired him  after friggin' killing the mayor of Boston  if it was going to be trouble.  They flew down to Washington, met me.  I thought everything was cool.  They pulled the wool over my eyes  and bamboozled me like Satan.  You can't make a deal with the devil.  You never win.  It sounds good.  You think you have all your faces covered.  But before you know it,  you've got a pitchfork in your hair. 
[00:07:00]  That was two years ago.  Yeah, it was.  A little plane trip to Washington.  Oh, you boys look okay.  Go back to New York.  Good luck.  God damn, I just got my goddamn tongue off  for saying that.  Two years ago, we had to fly down to Washington  to meet the guy behind the voice.  Yeah.  And he wanted to just make sure  we didn't have horns in our head  and then he sent us on our way. 
[00:07:30]  Remember that day?  Yes, sir.  We do regret what we did in Boston.  It was a simple little joke gone awry.  We will never do anything like that again.  It totally got out of hand.  We blame it mostly on management  who didn't intervene at an earlier date  and could have maybe saved the whole thing.  We are but entertainers  who would love to entertain for your company, sir.  All right, you look okay.  Go to NW and have fun.  Fast forward one month. 
[00:08:00]  God damn, boys!  Don't give me a heart attack!  That was the best, though.  Before NW was allowed to hire us,  we had to fly down  to meet the guy behind the voice.  Yeah.  We flew from Boston to Washington.  We took a 45-minute cab ride to his office.  We met with him for a total of five minutes. 
[00:08:30]  Five minutes.  He made sure we didn't have horns in our head.  We were like dressed in suits.  Dressed in suits.  I assumed I'm going to be in Washington for the night  and have dinner and drinks and stuff.  We were in his office for five to seven minutes.  He goes,  All right, wait on time for your cab.  Right.  He goes,  Okay, I'm satisfied.  I'll let them hire you.  And he goes,  Can I call you a cab?  Yeah.  And then we had to take the 45-minute cab ride back  to the airport.  And we were in Boston for dinner.  It was the most bizarre day of my life.  I should have killed you when I had the chance. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, man.  You were right in front of me.  Right before me.  Beezlebub.  Right there.  Right in front of my eyes.  And I didn't see it.  Clean and able.  I should have killed his ball.  This is coming in.  Anthony, you have bigger balls than Jennery.  Oh, please.  Well, all right.  You've got to be good, Opie. 
[00:09:30]  I was good.  For the first time, I was good.  Hey, isn't you just doing this break in the middle?  Just doing this break in the middle?  Is it really?  Technically.  I didn't discuss any other...  Eh?  Well, no.  No.  Station or air personality.  Hi, hi.  Yes, we did.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, I read a rumor that they're going to hold back syndication in now 17 years.  I read it on the New York Radio message board. 
[00:10:00]  Are we going to divide that now?  We had syndication right in our arms, and it was ripped away by an armed guy in a helmet.  Who is it, Earl?  All right.  Hey, don't forget Paizano's more specials.  Thank you, Joe.  I'm sure Joey appreciates it.  Yeah.  Let's go to Don on line 10.  Don.  Oh, yeah.  How you doing, boys?  I just want you boys to know that it's okay for you to...  Knock it off! 
[00:10:30]  Knock it off!  I don't know who that guy was trying to imitate.  James, what's up?  Ooh, no, this is...  Okay.  Okay, listen.  All right.  And them Duke boys are in a heap load of trouble.  We're going to put your ass in the general league and send you over to Cliff.  Uh, Doug, what's up? 
[00:11:00]  Hey, what's going on?  I'm just seeing what you guys did.  I came out of the store.  I heard the radio, and I heard him talk about love.  What are you guys up to now?  Uh, we ran out of delay.  Let's just put it that way.  They turn the key when they run out of delay, and then they put music on, and it happened  once again today.  Jesus, you're the only way I can compare you to, like, you're the two keys in the back of  the classroom that just make fucking everyone.  It's the only way I can compare you.  I just wish we knew when to stop.  We're like the crack man.  We're trying to stop, but... 
[00:11:30]  I have to slow down.  And we're always jonesing.  You can't get off the crack pipe.  We're trying to cut back.  We're trying to stop, but man, it's right in front of us.  I don't like your stay now, pay later policy.  The first step is admitting it.  All right, Doug, thank you.  All right, no problem.  Look at that.  All right, let's go to Steve real fast.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, Anthony, you better stop booking some more Band-Aids.  You might need it.  You're the best when you go over the line.  Yeah, I don't know.  You're only making money. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, well, for some reason, that doesn't matter.  Hey, Opie, you better take up an instrument.  Take care.  All right, man.  Oh, well, I guess that bit's done.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve?  Yo.  How are you?  I just called before because I wanted to make sure you weren't playing some more archive stuff  and you were still there and your asses weren't out on the street.  No, I think that was okay, right?  Oh, listen, I think that stuff is, like, the funniest stuff there is that you guys do. 
[00:12:30]  Ron Ivan, Ivan in the evening program.  In the old days, you used to be able to make fun of everyone,  but now that, like, only two people own every station in New York, it makes it very tough.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  Corporate America has taken over, and it's just so PC now.  You can't make fun of anybody.  Trust me, we would love to make fun of, like, Scott and Todd or something, but there's nothing there.  There's nothing funny there to make fun of.  There's nothing there.  Rocky Allen, he got fired today.  Well, we can make fun of that a little bit. 
[00:13:00]  Rocky Allen program.  Who are we going to make fun of?  There's nothing out there.  We own the...  This company owns the guys you want to make fun of because they got the personalities that are, you know...  Yeah, see?  I always thought it was a good thing.  Sort of like cross-promotion in a twisted kind of way, but...  Sure.  How the hell do you call that cross-promotion?  You make them sound like a-holes.  I mean, we're going to own MTV soon.  I guess we're not going to be able to make fun of MTV soon.  Yeah, what are we going to make fun of? 
[00:13:30]  The Q or the D.  I'm the kid.  There's no one to make fun of on Q104.  Two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday.  You guys should rename that song, Ain't Talking About Syndication.  Yeah, we need a new song.  Yeah, we need something that's more appropriate.  Highway to Hell.  Poor John the dumb guy, man.  Just didn't come in, he was all sweating, and he was, I swear to you, I'm not kidding, he was waving a white flag.  He had a white piece of cloth, and he's like, enough, please. 
[00:14:00]  He ran out of delay.  Get that arm guy from Little Havana to rescue John from the dump room.  John Gonzalez.  Debbie, what's going on?  I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys.  I heard the FBI was coming in in full assault here to take you out of the station.  Yeah, you're going to see me, and I'll be crying as we're being pulled away.  I'll miss you on my drive home.  It just won't be the same anymore.  Who's going to replace you?  If they're going to rip me out of the studio, though, if they're going to rip me out of the studio, I hope they, you know, send, like, a Playboy model. 
[00:14:30]  Instead of that pussy lady they sent for E.D. on.  Will you be in your pajamas?  Yes, I will.  My little PJs.  My little PJs.  I got feety pajamas.  All right, guys, take care.  Thank you, Debbie.  Bye.  All right, let's go to line seven.  Sir?  Hello?  Yeah.  Shut up, Opie.  Ah, shut up. 
[00:15:00]  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  102.7 WNEW.  All right, guys, when does it end the first day of your brand-new commute?  Yeah.  It's dead.  Two hours and a half.  Two and a half hours?  Door to door?  Door to door.  You're doing that every day. 
[00:15:30]  Two and a half hours.  Yes, I am.  Hey, look at that.  Are you serious?  I'm very serious.  All right.  It's so bad!  And per month it's going to cost me $225.  Total.  You could almost get a place for that.  Two and a quarter a month.  Yeah, and two and a half.  And two and a half hours.  Each way.  Each way.  Five hours of commuting every day for spaz.  Yes.  If you haven't been following the spaz story, he decided to be really far away from the radio station because his lovely girlfriend wanted to live closer to her family and friends, right? 
[00:16:00]  It was a mutual decision.  No, it wasn't.  We went over that.  Yeah, mutual.  You'll say that on the radio, but you were talked into this, let's face it.  Her side.  So you finally got this apartment.  You're not living out of the seedy motels anymore.  The 14-inch U-Haul.  As he called it last week.  What size U-Haul did you get, spaz?  It's a 14-inch.  And you signed a lease?  Yes, I signed a lease.  What time did you leave your new place, the spaz pad? 
[00:16:30]  Nine o'clock.  And what time did you arrive here at NEW?  11.35.  You can commute from Montauk, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  You can commute from Montauk every day.  Two and a half hours.  How many trains?  Three, actually.  You have to get on three trains every day each way.  Three trains, a plane, and a steamship.  Is that it, or do you have to get on a bus or anything? 
[00:17:00]  No, no buses.  Just three trains.  Just three trains.  I left nine o'clock last night, and I got here at 11.30 this morning.  But I'm going to get in early tomorrow because I'm staying at the St. Regis tonight.  Yeah, right?  Now, spaz, how are you going to pass the time on the train?  I have a 50-minute ride every day, and it drives me nuts.  The sunrise is so beautiful, okay, when you're driving, when you're taking the train.  What are you going to do for five hours a day on the train? 
[00:17:30]  I just doodle in my book.  I doodle.  You're going to get sick of doodling really fast.  You're a doodle brain, man.  Because in Sloatsburg, they don't have any...  Where the hell is Sloatsburg?  Wait a minute.  It's way up there.  You're up there?  You're in Sloatsburg?  Dude, Sloatsburg is like, that's the stop you go to.  When you drive upstate for anything, the show, or you drive into Albany, or you drive into  Woodstock, or wherever you're driving, Sloatsburg is the first place you really got to take  a leak, and you get off at the rest stop up there in Sloatsburg? 
[00:18:00]  It's so far away.  Sloatsburg?  There's no place to buy a newspaper or anything.  I was born and raised in the New York area.  I've never heard of Sloatsburg.  Oh, Sloatsburg is a popular rest stop.  The Sloatsburg stop after the Tappan Z.  You're taking...  After the Tappan Z.  Yeah, you take the thrillway up there, and you go through Sloatsburg, don't you?  Yeah.  But it's like ridiculous far away for a commute every day.  Dude, you're going to go insane. 
[00:18:30]  And how far are you from Sloatsburg?  No, I'm in the actual town.  Oh, you're in...  That's where you...  Well, around there, right?  Around you.  Okay.  In the outskirts.  Outskirts of it.  Sloatsburg, you got a celebrity in your town now.  Yeah, if we ever get syndicated to Albany, you can just drive up there.  Yeah.  I think it's closer.  Right.  Sloatsburg.  And you doodle on the train for five straight hours.  I doodle.  Well, I've been trying to figure out my finances on the train all...  Oh, that is doodling. 
[00:19:00]  I play Tic-Tac-Toe with myself.  I won most of the game.  He plays Hangman with himself.  With myself.  I figured when I'm X, I win a lot more than when I'm O.  I figured out the first hour and a half of my commute.  Two and a half hours.  I'm so glad.  You know, I'm not telling you anything anymore.  Because there was...  You had a decision to make.  Because Ant and I, we confronted you.  And we said, look, man, you don't have this place yet. 
[00:19:30]  It's still...  It's not too late to get out of this.  You aren't committed.  This commute is going to kill you.  We talked to you for like a half hour, about three days ago, about this.  I'm not giving you any advice anymore.  Stop calling me at home.  You're just...  You're just stupid.  Now, Spaz.  Spaz.  Think of this, too.  You're out of here the earliest after we pack everything up, 7.30.  Yeah.  Well, see, that's another problem.  10 o'clock at night.  Now, yeah, what time is your train?  See, there's one at 7.40. 
[00:20:00]  And if I don't make that one, I can't catch one until 9.40.  Oh, my God.  So then you're after midnight.  You're getting home.  Yeah.  And then you have to get up to get here.  You're in it.  You're the biggest idiot, man.  We gave you the chance.  We confronted you.  We...  Whoa!  Whoa!  Spaz, why didn't you listen to us?  It's only for a year.  See, I mean...  Only a year.  Spaz, listen to me.  You made an agreement? 
[00:20:30]  I made an agreement that after a year, we can move back down.  Spaz, let me tell you something.  It probably seemed exciting today.  It was a new commute.  You're on three different trains.  You're looking out the window going, wow, this is kind of neat.  Yes.  You are going to hate that commute.  I have a 50-minute commute every day.  Let me tell you real fast.  Do you know every rock on the side of the track?  Every phone pole?  Every rock, every stop.  Every graffiti spray-painted on any building you pass?  Let me tell you something.  If we're delayed two minutes because of, you know, doors or whatever...  Yeah.  You know, the Long Island Railroad has the stupidest delays in the history of transportation. 
[00:21:00]  But if we're delayed two minutes, I'm ready to punch someone.  I'm so freaking frustrated.  Your commute is two and a half hours.  Just wait till you get to the point where they start, you know, there's delays and you're missing...  What's going to be stopped on the train?  And you're missing trains and all sorts of crap.  See, if I miss one train, then I get only two hours from the next one.  Here's the commute.  Okay.  It's fast. 
[00:21:30]  There you go.  It's fast Ferguson.  It's taking a little too long to stop it.  What's unique about the Slokesburg train station is there's no ticket office and it's only a 15-foot landing.  Oh, that's really unique.  What's unique...  Let me give you a little Slokesburg history.  What's unique about the train station, which was built in 1859 by the Slokes... 
[00:22:00]  It's a hick town, man.  It's a totally hick town, dude.  Do you get the station up there?  Barely.  Keith, yeah, let's talk to Keith about this.  Slokesburg is only 50 minutes away, Keith.  Not even.  45 minutes.  He takes 17 south to move forward to the George Washington Bridge and he's there.  Yeah, but the thing is, he doesn't get the car.  The Erica gets the car.  And how long is Erica's commute?  10-15 minutes.  10-15 minutes she drives to where she's got to work. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  That takes the train two and a half hours.  And why does it take two and a half hours?  Do you have to wait at certain stops for trains to come by?  It's because I am lucky enough to catch the local train.  He gets the local train.  Oh, he gets the local train so it stops every like two seconds.  Let me explain this to you as well.  Long Island Railroad.  When I get on a later train and there's two extra stops they have to make, I'm going nuts. 
[00:23:00]  You see, if I want to catch the express, I have to catch like 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning train.  I hope Ed's got a good idea.  We ought to call up the officials up there in Sloatsburg and see if they won't name it Spazburg.  Spazburg, yes.  Rename it Spazburg.  Wouldn't that be a proud moment to get off the train at Spazburg?  And what is this lovely town known for?  I have no clue.  It's Sloats.  It's Sloats.  It's known as being the I've got to take a leak when you've been on the thruway for a while town. 
[00:23:30]  The only people that know of Sloatsburg that don't live there are the people that have taken a leak there on the thruway.  You're going upstate.  You're doing some hunting.  You're going to a concert.  You've got to go to Albany.  Whatever you've got to do, if you're taking the thruway, you take a leak in Sloatsburg.  That's what it's known for.  Well, that's what it was known for.  Now it's known as the home of Spaz.  Tom wants to let everyone know that it's only three hours to France.  On the concrete. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  Yeah, two and a half hours.  Let's see what transportation these days can get us.  In two and a half hours, you could be down in Orlando.  Or you could be in Sloatsburg.  You could be halfway across the country.  You could be halfway across the country.  At Spazburg.  At Spazburg.  Spazburg.  They've already renamed the town, Spazburg.  Spazburg.  Someone has got to do this.  I know there's a faithful listener that is close to that area.  You don't want to have welcome to...  Is it Slokesburg? 
[00:24:30]  Sloat.  Sloat.  When it says, welcome to Sloatburg, someone has got to change the sign, welcome to Spazburg.  And get a sign of it for the unofficial O.P. & Anthony website.  I will give you whatever you want if you make that happen.  See that?  Spazburg.  The Spazburg rest stop up there.  Just something with Sloatburg on it.  Welcome to Sloatburg.  Turn it to a welcome to Spazburg.  If you've ever been upstate, I know you've stopped there.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Spaz and it's a five-hour commute. 
[00:25:00]  It started...  Five hours.  Were you a little tired when you got in today?  Just a little bit, yeah.  I went to bed at 4.30 in the morning.  I had to wake up at 6.30.  Why do you have to get up at 6.30?  Well, because I like to take an hour and a half to two hours to get ready.  What are you a girl?  What?  What?  What are you a girl?  What do you do?  Dude, how long does it take to put on a Wasp freaking heavy metal T-shirt?  Yeah, really?  It's like you've got GQ.  You haven't shaved in a month. 
[00:25:30]  You've got an Alice in Chains hat to wear every single day.  And you've got a concert shirt on.  What are you doing for two and a half hours every morning?  I take a long shower.  I sit down.  I think.  You whack it in the shower?  I do not whack it in the shower.  The water doesn't help much.  Oh, my God.  I just like to take my time in the morning.  So sick.  Make sure my hair is okay and everything.  So an hour and a half.  Make sure your hair is not poofy. 
[00:26:00]  You put a hat on.  It doesn't matter what you do to your hair.  Uh-oh, are you getting page?  Are you getting page?  Voicemail.  Who is it?  I don't know.  It's voicemail.  Yeah, you know who it is.  Erica.  No.  Can we get her on the line?  Why?  Because I want to...  I would really like to hear her side of this as to why you live two and a half hours away  from the station.  Is it necessary?  Dave from Sloatsburg.  She's at work now.  Dave from Sloatsburg checking in.  Get the F out of my town.  Here goes the neighbor. 
[00:26:30]  Spaz, your lovely girlfriend's on the line and she says, can I talk to those a-holes?  Oh, really?  The lovely and talented Erica, everyone.  How are you, Erica?  Fine.  Erica.  Yes.  How are you?  We're a little concerned about our buddy Spaz here.  No, please.  No.  You have to know by now that anything he says that comes out of his mouth is not anywhere  remotely to the truth.  What?  He is the one that called, talked to the realtor about Sloatsburg.  I didn't even freaking think about Sloatsburg. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, Erica, why aren't you at work?  I'm on my way to work.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Ten minutes away, right?  Yeah, ten minutes away.  Goddamn, that's great.  You are a pisser, man.  What time do you have to work?  Four o'clock?  Yeah.  And that's what?  Two minutes ago from your apartment?  No, like 20 minutes ago.  Now, you two sat down and figured where you would live.  Right.  And why the beautiful Sloatsburg, New York? 
[00:27:30]  I didn't even know where Sloatsburg was.  And then he talks to the realtor when I'm at work, and they take all these appointments  to live in Sloatsburg.  I don't...  Is it a nice town, Erica?  Do you like it?  No.  Do you like it?  Oh, my God.  These are so many of them.  So, Erica, we're assuming that you guys are living in Sloatsburg because you wanted to  live there.  No, I didn't.  I wanted to live in, like, Kerrytown, closer to the station for him to buy us to go into 
[00:28:00]  the city in September anyway to go to school.  I think he just wants to keep you away from everybody.  That's how it is.  He figures the further away you are from the city, the safer he thinks you're going to  be.  No.  Chaz, does this look familiar?  That's the train station I got on this one.  Okay.  I just punched it up on the website.  The beautiful Sloatsburg train station, whether by bus, train, or car, Sloatsburg, is just  a few steps away.  And this just in at Sloatsburg, they will have electricity by the end of the summer. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, very good.  Do you have a groovy pad there, Erica?  It's all right.  Yeah?  We have no money for furniture, though, now that we've spent all of it on the security.  Yeah, but you can put that on the credit card, right?  No, I think the credit card's maxed, actually.  How long did it take for you to max your credit card?  I'd say about a week and a half.  $5,000 limit, right?  No, $5,500.  A week and a half! 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my good God.  And now we're finding out your girlfriend doesn't even want to live in Sloatsburg.  I like Sloatsburg.  This is what happened.  Okay, the realtor called me back.  She made a call to the realtor about all these different places in Nyack and New City  and all these other places.  Nyack, beautiful.  But Sloatsburg sounded good because it was cheap.  So I figured, let's go for Sloatsburg.  So I made all the appointments to see Sloatsburg.  I had no idea it was going to be that far north.  I never saw it before on the map.  If you never saw it before on the map, why would you want to live there? 
[00:29:30]  Wow, Eric, it seems like she didn't want to move there.  It sounded good.  It sounded good.  Well, no, because he makes it sound like it's all my fault.  I never did.  Now you guys are stuck in a town you don't even want to be in.  All your money's gone because this realtor has it.  And your credit card's maxed out.  Spaz, have you been to Chung-Wai yet?  Have you seen the dining?  How about meals, deli, and restaurant?  I have no.  Food Mart of Sloatsburg?  I think we've seen Food Mart.  Olympic Pizzeria and Restaurant? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I think that's on the same block.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  The closest grocery store is like 20 minutes away.  Oh, my God, no.  Sloatsburg, we're on the road.  Oh, Erica, he took you to Sloatsburg, man.  I thought it'd be cheap.  I never said it was all you.  It was a mutual decision.  Uh-huh.  Hey, Erica, I've got to ask you something else, too.  Spaz says he has to get up.  At what time, Spaz?  About 6.30.  6.30, because he needs two and a half hours to get ready.  Erica, what does Spaz do to get ready for his day? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Well, he gropes me while I'm sleeping for like 15 minutes.  Oh, Lord.  In what way does he grope you?  He just gropes me, like, when I have to sleep and then I get pissed off because I don't get  home until 3 o'clock in the morning.  He's getting up at 6.  He gropes me for the 15 minutes.  I want some loving.  He just, like, will lay around and then he has to take a really long shower and... 
[00:31:00]  Well, obviously, he's whacking it because he's whacking it.  He's, like, he's touching your body and stuff and then he's all excited and then he's got  to spank it in his shower.  Do you ever check the drain when you go in to take a shower after him?  No.  Do you ever check the ceiling?  All right, so then he takes a really long shower.  Obviously, he's whacking it.  He won't admit that to anyone.  What else are you doing in the shower unless you're going to whack it?  You grope your chick.  What are you going to do? 
[00:31:30]  Just forget about it.  Yeah, I make sure I'm thoroughly clean.  All right?  And then, Erica, then what does he do?  Then he just gets ready.  I don't know what he does the rest of the time, honestly.  I don't know.  What do you do?  Yes, lifestyles of the poor and destitute.  It's Spaz and the lovely Erica in their palatial estate in beautiful Sloatsburg.  Where are they dining? 
[00:32:00]  Where all the stars dine.  Chen was.  The only drink restaurant in Sloatsburg.  Let's take a look at the sprawling Spaz estate.  Here's the front door, a foyer, and the back door.  That lawn won't be much of an upkeep with the old gremlins and pintos on blocks in front of it. 
[00:32:30]  And then let's go to the Greek-Italian restaurant for some lousy Sloatsburg pizza.  Look at the spectacular view of the thruway.  Here's Spaz in a tender moment, groping a sleeping Erica.  And then for one of his luxurious whacking sessions in the shower. 
[00:33:00]  That works well.  Oh, man.  Sloatsburg.  It's Spazburg from now on.  The new Beverly Hills, Sloatsburg.  Celebrities from all over the world moving to Sloatsburg.  Here's a limo pulling up with none other than Sylvester Stallone. 
[00:33:30]  There's a guy in the line that has an apartment up for grabs in Buffalo, if you guys want to look at that.  Buffalo.  That's not much of a commute.  Oh, brother.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  Here's one of the jumbo jets, the 747s, coming in at the Sloatsburg Airport.  On the 50-foot runway.  The Sloatsburg International Airport. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, poor Erica.  Here's Gary Coleman and Eartha Kitt stopping by the Spaz Pad.  Sloatsburg Spa and Resort.  Lifestyles of the poor and destitute.  Here we go into the Spaz Pad to see the furniture made up of milk crates and beanbag chairs.  Lovely.  Sleeping on an old mattress.  Yeah, a little twin-size mattress. 
[00:34:30]  A twin-size mattress.  A twin-size mattress.  The Spaz will grope you on.  Now it's off to the Sloatsburg 7-Eleven for a big bite.  No wonder he's groping you.  He's sleeping right on top of you.  Ah, nachos and a big gulf.  No bed, Prince.  Dinner of the stars.  Forget the limos and town cars.  Here's Spaz's mode of transportation. 
[00:35:00]  Two and a half hours on a train.  The Sloatsburg Express.  Luxury liner.  Here's Spaz on the platform.  Oopsie missed the train.  He'll see you tomorrow, Erica.  Or may I say grope you tomorrow.  Robin Leach here on location in Sloatsburg.  Lovely.  Malt liquor wishes and catered pot dreams. 
[00:35:30]  Here's the ironing board where Erica with the ironing spaz is heavy metal.  She's dead.  Until next year when they get a butler.  Smell the lovely air here in Sloatsburg.  The wonderful aroma of Kalmanor.  All right.  Here's Spaz at the Sloatsburg Elementary School touching children. 
[00:36:00]  Maybe you guys can come see our little place in Sloatsburg.  Well, I got a week vacation coming up.  I'm going to need that to travel up there.  Vacation in Sloatsburg.  Who needs Monaco when we have Sloatsburg?  Located right on the border of Connecticut and Jersey.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad. 
[00:36:30]  Booyah.  Sucks man from wall to wall.  Booyah.  1027 WNEW.  Nice.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Call us.  We got to start talking about the day's events now, Anthony.  Yes.  Yeah.  But also we got to talk about the Super Bowl a little bit.  The stupid commercials.  Well, every year that's the big thing.  That is a new commercial.  That's just gotten blown out of proportion.  I thought all the commercials pretty much blew. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, they pay like two mil for each one, I guess.  Actually, the one with, see, I don't even know the company, so they didn't make an impression  on me, where at the end of the commercial they said, we just wasted two million dollars  on this.  That was pretty funny, but to tell you the truth, the next day, Monday here, I don't  remember what it was for.  So I guess they did waste two million.  They were in the, I don't know, they were playing instruments or something in the garage.  I wasn't even watching.  Well, because we had the party last night, this morning, I woke up not feeling that great, 
[00:37:30]  but I taped the whole Super Bowl, so I'm like just fast forwarding, trying to, you know,  check out the commercials to see what the big deal was.  Yeah.  I mean, the Christopher Reeve walking commercial.  Oh.  What was that?  I don't even know what it was for.  I didn't see that.  Some investment firm, I believe.  They're only going to invest in.  Talking about, like, in the future, some of these diseases will be cured, and all of a  sudden, he comes walking out.  God, let Steven Spielberg or somebody make your commercial, because it was so obvious. 
[00:38:00]  It was bad.  What do you mean?  It was, wait, Christopher Reeve came walking out?  Yeah, it was special effects, obviously.  What did they do?  But his head didn't move at all, because in real life, it just doesn't move.  Oh, so it was still his, like, paralyzed head.  On a body that could move.  Oh, that's sick.  Paralyzed head.  That is sick.  Did he have the big collar on, too?  Like, yeah.  Like, naturally, he would move, like, his head to, like, you know, say hi to someone,  but all it was was his eyes on a body that moves.  It was just, oh, that's bizarre.  I'll be honest, it was creepy. 
[00:38:30]  I was just like, whoa, what's this about?  I am Christopher Reeve.  Oh, they just transplanted his head.  They just transplanted his head on a moving body, yeah.  They were really hoping that was going to be the commercial this year, and it just...  They should have done, like, they did in that old Bugs Bunny episode.  Put his head on, like, Marvin Martian's body or something.  Then when Bugs was drawing and daffy, and he didn't know it, and he kept erasing his body  and drawing, like, a big creature's body on there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cut that out!  Should have done that. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, definitely.  Put him on a Wookiee body or something.  Yeah, that's true.  Chris has a good point.  Guys, couldn't you just rent Superman 1, 2, or 3 to see Christopher Reeve 1?  He didn't have to go through all that and have his paralyzed head on a regular body.  Anthony, we got the audio of Christopher Reeve walking.  Really?  In the commercial yesterday.  What good is audio going to do?  Oh, it'll do well.  All right.  All right, let's listen to the audio of Christopher Reeve miraculously walking in that Super Bowl  commercial last night, okay? 
[00:39:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What's been on a staircase?  That's disgusting.  That's terrible.  Come on.  Well, I thought it was the audio.  I apologize for that if anyone was offended.  Holy Jesus.  It's like Peter Boyle and Dream Team, get up and walk my son.  I truly believe that we really had the audio there, Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  I'm sorry.  I apologize for that.  Okay?  That's wrong.  Patrick, you're next.  Yeah, man.  And that Christopher Reeve commercial, I also did the one with Muhammad Ali.  That was WebMD.  Oh, the Muhammad?  The Muhammad Ali one.  He was staring at a camera, like, throwing punches.  That was creepy.  Yeah.  What were they getting at?  All of a sudden, they had Muhammad Ali just...  Oh, no, man.  And the whole screen is the big Muhammad Ali head, and he's, like, sparring into the TV.  Yeah.  Oh, that was... 
[00:40:30]  I don't know, man.  The party I was at, we saw that.  We were just like, that's not right, man.  Where's the little girl singing Pepsi commercials?  These commercials are weird this year.  They were trying too hard, you know?  Russ from New York here.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, my grandmother watched the Christopher Reeve commercial.  She thought there was a cure and got up from her wheelchair.  She fell and was knocked out for, like, three hours.  Oh, best to your grandma, then.  Look at if they showed the commercial, like, nursing homes and stuff.  Superman was walking like RoboCop. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, what actor does Christopher Reeve wish he was?  Christopher Walken?  Christopher Walken.  I don't know.  I didn't even see that.  Steve, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Wait.  Did you just pick up on that accidental place that Christopher Reeve's commercial was ran?  That guy got almost paralyzed, and they were bringing up the stretcher,  and then all of a sudden Christopher Reeve's walking around and talking to Diane Sawyer?  Oh, I didn't even know that.  The guy's laying out on the turf.  They got doctors all around them.  They got the stretcher. 
[00:41:30]  They're putting the collar on them.  Yeah.  They took his face mask off the helmet.  And they're like, we'll be right back after these days.  Christopher Reeve can walk.  How come this guy can't get up and walk?  Wow.  What's up with that?  Christopher Reeve's wife's one of us on the field that's sex with the guy.  Oh, my God.  All right.  You guys masturbate.  Later on.  Thank you, Steve.  Again, a couple of instant feedbacks here from people that want the Christopher Reeve walking sound effect  to replace the train and the gunship for people talking.  Oh, really?  Look how Christopher Reeve's going to fall on you.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  We can put it in your little sound thing over there. 
[00:42:00]  Let me hear that one more time.  All right.  You got that?  We really can't confirm, but we think this is the audio of Christopher Reeve walking during  that commercial last night during the Super Bowl.  What the hell did he fall into?  Like a big pit full of glass. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, exactly.  It's like a tightrope over a junkyard.  Where does he walk?  It's a cartoon sound effect for falling.  Come on.  I love it.  Sounds like it's more of the planet.  Come on.  Use your imagination.  Come on.  Wow.  Hey, Ray, what's up?  How you doing?  All right, Ray.  That's too funny, Ray. 
[00:43:00]  That's too funny, Ray.  That's a new kind of example.  That is too funny.  The commercials this year, they suck.  Yeah.  I bet you everybody had these killer commercials planned, and then they found out that it was  just going to be the Rams and the Titans, and they pulled it all.  Yeah.  Anyway, keep up the good job, guys.  Thank you, Ray.  Taylor, what's going on?  Hey, did you guys catch the, there was like this lame commercial with like a 78-year-old  guy for a heart pill?  I'm like, what is this?  And it's like this guy's sitting there going, if you take this pill, you will not have a 
[00:43:30]  heart attack.  I was like, Yoda is now on my television.  I'll tell you, these commercials just frighten me, between the Christopher Reeve robot walk,  the old guy, the Muhammad Ali staring into the camera, you know, sparring.  That Muhammad Ali commercial was psycho.  Yeah.  That was just disturbing.  It didn't even have a point at the end.  No.  It had no point.  Right.  And it was just like, okay, Muhammad Ali can't speak, Christopher Reeve can't walk, 
[00:44:00]  and yet they're still getting sponsorship ads.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't get work these days.  I was going to say, Ed and I need to fire our agent at this point.  Exactly.  If you can't speak and you can't walk, call your agent.  You can get on a dot-com commercial.  There you go.  Thank you, Taylor.  You can't get my heart for one, Opie, right?  This old guy, I thought it was a gag.  And they show his hands.  He's got disfigured hands with big, long fingernails holding a heart pill.  It was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.  I'm like, I'm waiting for a joke. 
[00:44:30]  Well, take a look at the pictures of you dumping on the unofficial website.  I know.  You'll see the new disgusting thing you've ever seen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The papers just trashed that commercial saying it was horrific.  Oh, my God.  Todd, what's up?  I don't know if you noticed, but did you see the body that Christopher Reeve, they used.  It looked like Lurch.  Yeah.  It was like, the body was like way too big for it.  His head looked like a little pee on the body.  It was like, it was ridiculous.  You know what it looked like, the character from Men in Black?  When the one guy's head gets really small, it would be in the Beetlejuice. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  It was totally, totally out of proportion.  Yeah.  I mean, who did that commercial?  I mean, they could have got Spielberg or someone to make it look really good.  All right.  As we go to break here, Anthony, let's listen to the audio of Christopher Reeve walking during  the commercial during the Super Bowl there.  Okay.  All right.  One more time here.  Slow down your car, people.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:45:30]  That doesn't sound so bad.  Sucks man from wall to wall.  1027 WNEW.  All right.  We're hanging with Brian Regan today, Anthony.  Yes.  He's horrified once again, so we did our job.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know how this happens every time. 
[00:46:00]  We're like that friend where they drink the sour milk and they're like, oh, this is awful.  Try it.  Taste this.  Next time I come in, I'm just going to have black tape over my eyes, you know, duct tape.  You better.  I'm not going to see anything.  I really want to listen.  A lot of people want to say hi.  Brooks, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  How's it going?  All right.  I'm a big Brian Regan fan.  I just want to let you guys know that I had pizza for lunch today.  Listen, I just want to congratulate Brian on being funny as anything and still keeping his act clean. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Thanks.  I mean, I've seen him.  I'm originally from North Carolina, and I saw him down there in Charlotte, and we're going Friday night.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Yeah, it's a great show.  It's a great show, man.  It's a great show.  I'm not going to be in Charlotte Friday night.  Hey.  No, I'm going to Carolina.  We're looking forward to it.  Thank you so much, man.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  I think we're corrupting this guy.  Brian Regan.  He works clean, okay?  Absolutely clean.  You could take a child to his act, and it's hysterical. 
[00:47:00]  I do believe this guy has a sick side, though.  A couple more of these shows, he's going to get on stage.  Hickory dickory dogs.  It's Dick A.E.  I'm Brian Regan.  I'm the legend.  Oh!  What happened to all the childhood stuff?  It's like, you know, the rat thing last time.  It's like, you guys were, like, really cool.  Like, well, we know you got to go, and there's something about me that just couldn't leave.  I got to watch this, man.  These guys are going to be eating these damn rats.  I got to see it.  And now there's a hemorrhoid.  A hemorrhoid waiting to pop out. 
[00:47:30]  You ever read the panel on Fig Newton?  Let me tell you something.  I had this Fig Newton and this chick.  Oh!  The big yellow one's the sun, you deaf and see.  Oh!  A cup of dirt.  A cup of dirt.  I call it cup of dirt, you stupid whore.  Hey!  I think I just had pizza. 
[00:48:00]  That was funny.  Hey, can I request a bit?  Because I'm like...  Look at you.  I'm a big fan, though.  You know.  You still got the slow cone!  I like donut lady.  Donut lady?  Yeah.  I like donut lady.  You know...  I'll just get right into it.  Yeah.  It's interesting you mention that. 
[00:48:30]  Because I bought some donuts today.  Which is a weird coincidence.  You know, those ladies that work in the donut places, I just...  I feel so bad for them because people can't make up their mind, you know?  People go in there and they freak out.  They just...  They walk in.  Oh!  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  I want a dozen donuts and...  You got a lot of donuts. 
[00:49:00]  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to start with four chocolate.  I want two Twisty Goose.  I want a Lemon Twirler.  I want Honey Twip.  I want a Raspberry Puffy Twirl.  No!  Two chocolate.  No!  One!  Put them back!  Put them back!  I want a Bavarian Apple Crunch!  Get the latter!  Hey.  Hey.  Why don't you go out inside and think it over, huh?  It's a big decision.  You can't blow donut day. 
[00:49:30]  But the donut ladies, they know how to get back.  They know how to get back at you.  They do the subtraction for you in front of all the other customers and make you look stupid.  You go in there.  Um.  Yeah, I'd like a dozen donuts.  I'll start with...  I'll start with seven chocolate.  You have five left.  Oh!  Okay.  All right.  If I order one more, then how many would I have left?  How many would I have then, donut lady?  That's what I need to know and now! 
[00:50:00]  I don't know how she does it, man.  I think she's palming a clicker.  She's cupping some kind of advantage.  Goddamn.  That's great stuff.  I ain't gonna do that.  What are you talking about?  He's talking about donuts and he doesn't mention he's like whores.  I didn't think of that, man.  Andrew Dice Regan, okay? 
[00:50:30]  Another direction I could take that.  Sure.  What are you waiting for?  Come to the dark side.  Okay?  Now let's say donut lady starts playing ring toss on your meat.  Now that's funny.  If you go to the show tonight, I'll be throwing that in.  I don't believe he's doing it.  Hey!  Cheryl checking in.  Coincidence, he's eating donuts right now. 
[00:51:00]  More people telling us what he's eating.  I'm having dinner right now.  Okay, my question.  Hey, so what's going to have to do with anything?  Yeah, let's go to George.  George, what's up?  Hey, George.  I'm listening on the radio to a 27-second delay.  I haven't heard them ask for me yet.  The radio, but they're talking to me on the phone.  George is gathering his thoughts.  Which should I acknowledge, phone or radio?  Right now he's writing them down in a placard.  Well, I write it, then I read it. 
[00:51:30]  I hold it over my head on O-Tag.  Wait, I'm driving.  My current thought.  Jim, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I had a phone call at the airport the other day.  I was checking in my bag for the flight,  and the woman said, have a good flight.  And I said, you too.  I like the freaking tools.  That's one of my favorite, Brian Riggins.  You feel so bad for saying that.  When I listened to your bit you were doing on it,  I was like, God damn it.  You just, you can never get over that embarrassment. 
[00:52:00]  You just have to run away.  Run away.  That happened to me about four months ago at the airport, I swear.  You did it.  And the reservations gave me the tickets,  and she said, enjoy your flight.  I said, you too.  And I said, I don't believe I did that.  And she goes, oh, it happens all the time.  I'm like, listen, you have no idea.  No, you don't know how bad this is.  You have no idea how dumb of an error this is coming from me.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  I just slinked away.  You too, in case you fly later. 
[00:52:30]  If you get on a plane sometime, then you enjoy your flight then.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm trying to say.  If you think about it.  You have a chance to have a flight.  You get a chance.  It's not easy to get a chance to have a flight.  If you get a chance to have a flight, then I would take it.  Get on in and enjoy it.  You too.  Oh, you too. 
[00:53:00]  In case you fly.  You too.  Brian, can I request one other thing?  You don't have to do the whole thing.  Sure.  Do the donut lady again.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I love that one.  You're obviously in New York for the weekend.  Yes.  With your lovely wife.  Yes.  Playing Caroline's, huh?  Good, right?  That's right.  All weekend long, call Caroline's, 212-757-4100.  Are you staying at a hotel or at a friend's house?  Wow, nice, Sophie. 
[00:53:30]  This must be on your mind.  That's too subtle.  I just love that one part of the event.  You don't have to do the whole thing.  I'm staying at a friend's house.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They're letting me sleep on their fold-out couch.  Which is nice, you know?  It's nice when people put you up.  But people don't sleep on their own fold-out couch.  They have no idea what a torture rack the thing is, you know?  They mean well.  It's like, oh, here, you can sleep on it.  They're opening up this big thing. 
[00:54:00]  It's all cockeyed.  There's one leg that won't even hit the ground.  They're brushing off old Pop-Tart crumbs.  They're flapping sheets all over hell.  We're going to get it all set up.  You're going to get it all set up.  You can feel goofy just standing there with your hands on your hips.  Yeah, set it up.  Set it up for me.  Let me know when it's all set.  All set up.  And then they have a mattress, you know?  It's about like a quarter-inch thick. 
[00:54:30]  And they have that death bar going right down the middle.  It's like you're sleeping on the top of a doghouse.  Oh, this is nice.  The next morning, did you sleep well?  Yeah, once I got under the couch with the dog.  So, no, I'm not in a hotel.  I'm not staying in a hotel.  They insisted that you stay with them, yes.  Oh, man.  Hey, Jay, Jay's back. 
[00:55:00]  Hey, Jay.  In business.  Brian, isn't there a donut shop right by the...  Yes, there is, Jay.  I went in there.  No, there is.  Seriously.  I don't think Jay heard the last...  Where were you, Jay?  People listening, does he just have the two jokes?  Tony, what's going on?  Tony.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, we're hanging with Brian Riggins.  Yeah, I was just thinking about Brian the other day because I went to a McDonald's drive-thru 
[00:55:30]  and I ordered those super-sized meals that they give you.  Yeah.  They gave me those huge sodas and I couldn't fit into my cup holder.  And I'm going out to everybody in my car like,  I should have gotten the medium.  I should have gotten the medium.  Nobody got what I was saying.  I think medium is the most ludicrous size anyway.  What does that mean, you know?  And what I do, you know what you do when you go into these places?  You order an extra medium.  And that just throws them for a loop.  You know, the guy just turns around.  He's like, oh.  I see him talking with the manager. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know.  He said he wanted an extra medium.  And I'm looking at the mediums.  I don't know how to extra it.  You're going to these fast food places.  They got the cup-sized display hanging from a string.  You know, some kid had to tie it up in the air conditioning duct, you know.  There they are.  There are the cup-sized.  Check them over carefully because it's time to pick a cup. 
[00:56:30]  And next to the big one, there's a big arrow and it says, best value.  What kind of thing is that to do?  Why do you have the other two?  What is that to do?  Why are you doing that to your customers?  You want the best?  That's the best.  This is the nitwit side.  This is our fool's cup.  What are people like looking up?  I don't know which one.  They got so many.  Wait a second.  That one has an arrow.  That one has a big arrow. 
[00:57:00]  And it says, best.  Yeah, they wouldn't lie, man.  They wouldn't lie to you.  It's unlimited refills on all sizes.  It's all you want for $0.89, all you want for $1.09, or all you want for $1.49.  Yeah, you go for that best value.  You keep digging for more coins.  Oh, boy. 
[00:57:30]  Caroline's.  Tonight, tomorrow.  Saturday, Sunday.  Yeah.  He kills every time he's in town.  Are you guys going to go?  Yeah, we'll be there tomorrow night.  Know what Brian did for us?  I got to thank you.  We went and saw him at another comedy club last time he was in town.  I bought him a free drink, Jay.  He found out that we were staying for the second show.  He changed his entire act just to suit us.  Even though it was a whole new audience, everyone wasn't there for the first act. 
[00:58:00]  I did Jay's act.  I was tasked on my own stuff.  Yours has been working for me at college for years.  That old get out of a hole, that Regan shovel.  They're not buying my stuff.  Oh, ever go to the donut shop?  Let's go to Beth.  Beth, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to let Brian know that he doesn't know how many times he's referred to in our family.  All during the Subway Series, my brothers and I are like, great, two way, two way, two way. 
[00:58:30]  And then you do it out of the club, and you wait for like a sports bar, and you wait for one guy in the back to go,  what the hell does that mean?  And you're like, dude, Brian Regan's fan.  You know, when I used to play on right field, you know, I never knew what was going on out there.  And the second baseman would, like, do the Texas Longhorn thing with his hands and just,  Brian, two way.  Two way, Brian.  You know, like I'm some kind of moron.  Oh, okay.  Two way, Brian.  Thank you for the information. 
[00:59:00]  The special attention.  Apparently, I didn't know where to stand in right field either.  I don't know what it is with the infielders.  You know, they think they know what's going on, that the second baseman would turn around  and always tell me to stand somewhere other than where I already was.  Brian, back up.  Brian, a little bit to the right.  You know, like I'm a little, I actually just have strings, you know, Mr. Puppet.  You direct me, Mr. Second Baseman. 
[00:59:30]  I don't know anything.  I'm an outfielder.  Direct me to an appropriate position that you would know about being an infielder and  all.  He's killing me.  Goddamn.  Yes.  Brian's one of the only comics that I ever drove to go see.  He was at Irvine, and that's like an hour out of L.A., and I made my wife get in the  car and we drove all the way down to Irvine to see him. 
[01:00:00]  And rush hour traffic.  I'm very flattered.  Really?  Not being a call line?  No way.  No, Brian, I would drive to see, like, Chris Rock.  Trying to think, like, Otto and George, I go out of my way to see him.  I would see a Jay Moore movie, but not if I had to drive.  No, I like him, but if it was, like, right across the street, yeah, I'd walk over.  Well, fortunately, you can see him when you fly.  Yeah, yeah, no, that's pretty much the theme. 
[01:00:30]  Jay Moore, it's a good rental, right?  Jay Moore, and it's Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Yeah, the idea.  Jay Moore's in that?  I like Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Hey, let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up, Jay and Brian?  Hey, what's up, man?  Yo, I had a question for Brian.  Yeah.  I was down south in Georgia last summer, and I saw a movie, and in the trailer, when  they, like, when they show, oh, you knew?  No, no, no, I'm thinking of something else.  I don't know where anything is going.  You know, in the beginning of the movie, they have the stupid candies dancing, like, 
[01:01:00]  let's go to the lobby?  Right, right.  Well, I saw one with Brian, who was like, hey, let's go get some popcorn.  That's right.  And then you see him at the sink.  I only saw it, like, three times, though.  It was the funniest stuff.  Brian and Wayne, you were in the, like, movie then?  Brian didn't seem too happy about this.  Remember that porn film in the 70s, Brian?  You had the big 70s mustache, pork chop sideburns, and you lived to other guys?  I know, it isn't.  Did the rabbit live, Brian? 
[01:01:30]  How'd the rabbit?  I remember it looked like it got stepped on.  No, it was Coca-Cola did these, like, little trailers, you know,  that was, like, a minute long before the movie started.  And it was me just ordering a Coke and a popcorn and then doing one of my bits, you know.  But what was interesting is, you know, I would, like, the very first take, you know,  I said, yeah, I'd like to have a Coke and a popcorn.  And they go, cut, cut, large popcorn and large Coke, large Coke. 
[01:02:00]  I'm like, okay, I see what this is all about.  Yeah, this is all about Coke.  I buy large Coke.  Not about my little comedy.  It's a large, delicious, wonderful Coca-Cola, then that little comedy thing.  It was fun, man.  It was fun to do.  I'm glad that guy saw it.  Let's go to Vito.  The phone call's going wild now.  Vito, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Brian? 
[01:02:30]  You're a one funny mother effer.  Thank you, Vito.  Hey, listen, I've got to ask you a question.  I'm having a little problem cooking Pop-Tarts in a microwave.  You got any suggestions?  Your listeners are good set up there.  They're sharp.  Yeah, man.  You know, I don't understand.  You know, when you do look at the Pop-Tarts box, you know, they've got the directions.  I mean, can there be a simpler food item than Pop-Tarts?  Like, if the directions weren't on there, would somebody just set the box in front of them  and just look at it like, oh, how do I get that goodness in me? 
[01:03:00]  Where do you go?  How do you start?  But you don't have to fret because they've got directions.  They have two sets.  They have toaster directions, which is more than one step.  It just kills me that toaster directions are longer than one step.  Do you think it would be step one, toast the Pop-Tarts?  Go ahead.  Toast them.  Hey, are you still reading this?  But they've managed to break it up in a smaller increments. 
[01:03:30]  This is like the actual stuff.  Number one, I swear, it says remove pastry from pouch.  Oh, okay.  Let me get them out of the pouch.  All right.  I see where they're going with this.  I think we're banging on all sewingers now.  Okay, number two, insert pastry.  Okay, we got the pastry all organized.  Insert pastry vertically. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, oh, no.  That's when your brain explodes in the whole vertical concept.  And then at one point, they just start assuming you would understand certain things, you know.  And then the microwave directions.  I had no idea you could microwave a Pop-Tart.  How long does it take to toast a Pop-Tart, you know?  A minute and a half if you want it dark.  People don't have that kind of time.  You know, if you need to zap-fry your Pop-Tarts before you head out the door, 
[01:04:30]  you might want to loosen up your schedule.  And I swear, it says microwave on high for three seconds.  I don't think I want to wake up and be eating in three seconds, you know?  The alarm goes off.  Put it in.  Ding, ding.  Oh, it's loud.  I've got to get out of here.  If you're waking, eating, and hauling in three seconds, it's time for a change of lifestyle.  Pick up some Montana brochures or something.  I don't know if that answers your question.  What a coincidence.  It's like I was asking a Pop-Tart question. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, because I happen to know about Pop-Tarts.  Yeah, I had the advice right there.  Kenneth, what's going on?  Kenneth.  Yeah, man.  I just want to let him know, man.  He's funny.  He's hysterical, man.  Yeah.  We tell you guys every time he comes to town, man.  Thank you, Kenneth.  Hey, no problem, brother.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[01:05:30]  We're very happy today.  We've got one of our favorite guests in the studio, Brian Regan.  Last time Brian was in town, he was talking about some of our listeners and how they show up to his shows with signs, Anthony.  Well, yeah, son.  They do, yeah?  Well, actually, when I was last time in town, after the rat show, people came out and they, you know, had written down things on, like, these poster boards, you know, eat rats.  One person just had a, they just wrote rat.  And what would, you know, make somebody want to, you know, hey, you know, you were talking, I've got to go buy a poster board and write that word down because that was the topic. 
[01:06:00]  Or it's like if they do have a little thought, you know, are you going to eat rats?  It's like, this is what I'm thinking.  So I have to write it and hold it over my head.  This is my current thought.  I want everyone to know what my current thought is.  I might have another one next week and I'll write it down. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, that's them.  You know, it's like those people that, you know, down in Florida, you know, you know, gore is a moron.  Oh, yeah, the protesters.  You know, it's like you got anything else to do with your life that, you know, you come up with, it doesn't even rhyme.  You know, I don't think if you got to write something on a poster board, it should at least rhyme.  Right.  Or, you know, you have to go to jail or something.  Something catchy.  You can't just write something that doesn't even rhyme, it isn't catchy in any way. 
[01:07:00]  Cormor Gooder.  Cormor Gooder.  No to you, Bush.  No.  Why are you writing that down?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that is a true cluster F down there anyway.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Brian, you're great.  Thank you, man.  Listen, my kind of humor doesn't go over good in my house with three daughters.  Uh-oh.  My wife's like, keep your mouth shut around these kids. 
[01:07:30]  But you'd slide in right between Bing Crosby Christmas and all my Christmas CDs.  I got to get that Bobson CD.  Yeah, man.  What's the name of that CD?  I came up with a really fancy title.  Brian Regan Live.  Okay.  That's good.  I like that.  That whole volcano scene.  It's totally my wife.  And I told Mike, I told my wife, Mike, hey, keep the kids home from school.  Why don't you go bring the project to school?  You built it. 
[01:08:00]  Take care, man.  Hey, man.  Thanks, man.  Bye-bye.  And you can get it on Amazon.com.  Inspiring people.  I wasn't sure if that guy was complimenting me at the beginning when he said you were like  Bing Crosby and you're getting his CD rack.  Is he really slamming the ears?  Yeah.  What is that?  Yeah, rock and roll to you, buddy.  I feel you.  Let's go to Derek.  You're like Charo.  Back at you.  And you do it when people come up and they like, you know, they say they like you and 
[01:08:30]  somebody else and then the other person is like so off the charts, you don't know how  to take it.  You and Bozo the Clown.  You've got to be the funniest two guys on the planet.  When he honks his nose and when you do your routines, hey, thank you, man.  When I watch you, you know what I see?  Frank Stallone and the parrot from Beretta.  You lighten me up, man.  Doesn't that just negate the compliment?  It doesn't that just negate the compliment completely. 
[01:09:00]  It's like you rule me and then they tell you about stuff you've done and it's like some  of the stuff that you're proud of.  And then they just turn around and say something like, yeah, Bozo or I really like that.  There's some real hat.  Like, oh, Christ.  Just throw everything out the window.  Couldn't you have dropped dead of a stroke before you got to that part of a compliment?  I like you.  I like the kind of stuff you do.  And I like when somebody sticks a pie in somebody's face.  I just laugh, you know, because there's a pie.  You don't know, hey, it's in the space, you know. 
[01:09:30]  And your stuff, too.  The stuff you do in the pie.  Dude, I think you're talented, man.  You make me laugh.  Hey, do you know Sinbad?  You run into him?  Oh, God.  You run into him?  Because you, like, you two guys are the best.  Wow.  And Laverne and Shirley just cracks me up.  You know when they go, who could be that stupid?  Hello.  And then they walk through the door?  That gag?  I got to throw in.  I like Sinbad.  I got to throw in.  I thought so.  I saw a little punch in there.  I like Sinbad as well.  I like that shit. 
[01:10:00]  Look at Jay now.  I like Sinbad as well.  No, I will go on the record saying I do think Sinbad is funny.  All right.  Derek, I've never seen him.  I do think he's very funny.  Derek, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, how's it going?  Jay?  What's up?  Yes, sir.  Hey, Brian, I saw you up in Boston a while ago, and I'm not really sure about the bit,  but I know it involved the station wagon and your little brother.  Do you remember what I'm talking about?  Yeah, the closer when he has or something else? 
[01:10:30]  The big five-minute second-genite thing?  Oh, yeah, great.  You think I'm going to do that here?  Go to Caroline.  The thing that makes him stand up thing.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Could you do that high on Brian Regan thing?  Do that thing where there's no reason for anybody to come out and do it.  We're two bits away from having people not show up if they just heard everything. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I think we taped it all.  It's on Napster right now.  It's downloaded for nothing.  That's what's good about Brian Regan.  Brian Regan's got these guys forgotten more material than I've ever written.  There you go.  He's got hundreds of stuff.  Brian Regan at Caroline.  Are you drunk?  We do have some champagne here.  I've been laughing for the last hour.  He's got hundreds of stuff.  Hundreds of stuff.  And each one more gooder than the last.  Hey, you guys behave.  I'm bringing Tony King back in here.  I'm glad you got that, Brian.  I'm glad you got that, Brian Regan. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know if I literally want to see a hemorrhoid. 
[01:12:00]  I've never seen that.  How's your hemorrhoid donut, lady?  Plus it would be unfair for me.  That would be her time.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God.  Is that one of the hundreds of stuff that you have that is extremely funny? 
[01:12:30]  Trying to be diplomatic.  Diplomatic?  What are you dealing with?  He's nice enough to let me do my thing.  I'll let her do her thing.  He's the nicest guy in comedy.  Yeah.  I want to step on her toes.  You know, she's got things to promote.  Jugs magazine.  Hey, you never know who's going to pop one day.  It's like popcorn.  Some pop, some don't.  You never know.  That television show on Venus that she was promoting.  You may need a favor for her one day.  Oh, God.  If it ever gets to that point, shoot me. 
[01:13:00]  If you want to talk to Johnny, you've got to go through Sandy.  I was hoping we'd all see the hemorrhoid and Bond, but I guess not.  You know, I'd like to hear, like, the preliminary conversations about it.  And then, like, there you go.  All right, bring Sandy back in here.  Hundreds of stuff.  Hundreds of stuff.  All right, all right.  We're down to 98.  Eh, eh, eh, eh.  So, here comes Sandy.  Who's that right?  Bill, this is the guy I called up earlier and wants to rub the lotion.  Oh, I love it.  Oh, my God, really. 
[01:13:30]  This guy wants to put preparation H on.  You look like a normal guy.  Yeah, well, I love it.  So did Ted Bundy.  All right, I'm leaving.  I like it.  I'm coming.  So did Ted Bundy.  I loved that show, Married with Children.  I love it.  I'm waiting here.  I brought my own dick.  All right, she's talking to her dildo again, Anthony.  All right, no, it's my husband.  Um, Sandy?  Oh, my God.  I'm not lucky enough to have a girlfriend like you.  Didn't we quickly forget how annoying it is when we're in here until she gets back in? 
[01:14:00]  You're like, well, it really was really annoying.  It's like, let's give it another toy.  Don't put it in my...  All right.  Can I say rear?  Can you say...  Whatever.  Say vagina?  They'll deal with it down the hallway.  Anybody can say rear.  Right.  You can say rear.  Can you say the A word?  Just don't say anything.  A-A?  How about we start there?  Yeah, the word rear is pretty much accepted everywhere.  You're in.  It just matters the context.  There's not too many places you can't get away with rear.  Come on, table.  I'm public access.  You can say anything.  Maybe a few board meetings. 
[01:14:30]  I'm doing with a dunkiness.  I can't even think of a board meeting where they wouldn't appreciate the word rear.  I'm doing with a dunkiness.  I'm doing with a dunkiness.  I'm doing with a dunkiness.  I'm doing with a dunkiness.  Just going and going.  She doesn't stand up.  Of course.  There's four people talking at the same time.  All right.  I know I'm a pig.  I know.  Well, somebody put this retard out of his misery.  I haven't been this annoyed since that bitch from Big Brother was here.  Oh, God damn.  Brittany.  Hey, you didn't let me show my breasts here?  Well, there's a reason for that.  The vine is delightful. 
[01:15:00]  Don't hide.  Why don't you show up?  Tim Moore is here.  They love him.  I'm only here because Brian Regan is here.  Last night I was watching Action with Jay and I was taking my breasts.  It's Brian Regan time, honey.  Oh, Brian Regan.  No, no, no.  He's reading me, baby.  I'm Brian Ronald Reagan.  Let me say this.  Mr. Gorbachev, cover up those boobs.  I want to meet up Brian to impress Jody Foster.  I thought her boobs were Gorby's head until I saw it had no stain. 
[01:15:30]  If you're Reagan, I'm going to do something to Brian.  All right, Sandy, Sandy, what do you want to do?  You got a few minutes here.  What is this?  Yeah, we do.  What is she doing?  She's holding up pictures of other women in the magazine.  I'm not opposed to that photo.  That isn't you.  Jay's not opposed to that photo.  I don't mind that photo.  That is accepted.  What's the problem with that?  What's wrong with that?  Sandy.  Well, I'm in jugs this month, so...  Yeah, Sandy, what do you want to show us?  What do you want to do?  The real jugs.  All right, let's see your...  How can you tell?  Okay.  When they hang down to your waist, they're real.  All right, let's... 
[01:16:00]  Would you like to see them?  Brian, there's still time to get out of here.  I'm going to read you my notes.  Brian, if you leave me, don't worry.  Go over your act.  Me and my middle finger were going crazy for you last night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Sorry.  All right, well, what...  Oh, my God.  I think I just swallowed my chew.  Which one do I like?  It'll make you less nauseous, Jay.  Like Ron Guidry in a blind drive comes back at him.  This girl is showing the food.  Like in the Bronx Zoo.  Have you read the Bronx Zoo?  Me and my middle finger.  No, Jay. 
[01:16:30]  It's incredible.  No, Jay.  What happened?  You liar.  Jay's just talking about...  I've got to keep everybody's mind to lose my hemorrhoid.  This is like a three-ring circus.  I know.  Three different hemorrhoids.  Only all in the same ring.  I'm just talking over Sandy.  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  I'm undressing, because I feel so comfortable with him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes, he goes.  No, seriously.  She's undressing.  Now you'll see the ravage of a law called gravity.  I asked Sandy how old you are.  She wouldn't tell me.  I said, can you keep a secret?  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's mine. 
[01:17:00]  I want you to tell me exactly where you were when you found out that Lincoln was shot.  You'd cover it in half and count the rings.  Sandy, you can tell the age.  I can't believe you talked over that line.  It's not like you're 30 and you look 25, you know?  No, it's a good joke.  Where were you going to mow in your head?  No, I mean, you don't have to keep a secret.  Over 30, though.  I mean, I'm over 30.  Wow, I never would have guessed that.  I'm over 30, baby.  So, over 30, you're old.  How long do we have to wait?  Because you really don't have the body where you can, like, do the tantalizing angle. 
[01:17:30]  You know, make it wait.  That's a lot.  You know, we're, like, going on.  I hope you take some time.  What?  You don't have a great body?  Actually, for a woman your age, that I, as old as you're the age, I think you are.  I'd like to see you naked, Jay.  I'm sure there's something you could download.  Are you going to show the hemorrhoid?  Oh, okay.  Because this guy here wants to rub Preparation H on your hemorrhoid.  You're old school.  She's wanting to paste these. 
[01:18:00]  Okay, let me just take my...  She's old school.  She's really old school.  Well, you go right to the hemorrhoid, you guys.  Oh, man.  Yeah, aren't we?  It can't really work that tantalizing angle when you've got a body like that.  It's nothing's sacred anymore.  Oh, I'm going to get sick.  You should have a really fast striptease song.  Yeah, I should take it now.  Hey, guys, I don't believe it, but...  Look at the time.  I'm not going to have no clock.  I got it out of here, man.  If the cab driver tipped me, you guys are going to tip me for this a lot.  Your stripping song should be, like, the countdown to New Year's.  Oh, really? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, because it's only, like, ten seconds long.  What the hell?  You're taking off more stuff.  It's like a knight taking armor off.  Oh, yeah, listen, I grew up in that and I want to light my d*** on fire.  All right, there's one of the words we can't use.  Oh, sorry.  I'll have to get that done.  Yeah, you can't refer to...  She talks about the ear.  Yeah, you can't refer to breasts as the T word.  Oh, my God, what has she got?  Holy Jesus.  I thought I would never say this to a woman.  Put your clothes back on.  A nude woman turn around and say, can you put your clothes back on?  What are you doing? 
[01:19:00]  Okay, I just want to light my d*** on fire because I have a lot of fans listening.  They all said sand.  All right, this guy over here, get the girl from Big Brother back.  Swing the mic over to this gentleman over here.  She's still talking.  Now, sir, what's your name or the name you want to give?  Bill.  And you brought some Preparation H.  I did.  You have a glove on?  I do.  Yeah.  He's putting on a biohazard suit.  It looks like outrage.  It looks like the Michelin man.  I'm guessing that hemorrhoid is older than I am.  Now, it probably is. 
[01:19:30]  You have Preparation H, the glove, and you're going to apply this to her hemorrhoid.  Sure.  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies right here.  This is definitely something like a better idea about three hours ago.  What did you think it was going to be?  You said, oh, this is worse than I expected.  What did you expect?  Here's Brian.  Hi.  Brian.  I look like Britney Spears, and I really want you to apply this.  I really don't have hemorrhoids, and I'm going to turn around.  You're going to apply it that way with your own special applicator. 
[01:20:00]  Here we go.  Are you ready, guys?  Yeah, let's go.  But he gets this.  I'm just going to.  Brian, like the first.  Yeah, Brian, you just sit tight.  Brian, the first five times I was here, Brian, it was like young strippers.  And now look at what we got.  Puckers were making out.  That's all right.  You go do your thing.  Girls were getting your hoods pierced.  I'm going to come see you tonight.  All right.  All right.  Quit your talking.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you do this, a J or someone is going to have to mic her.  Don't look at me.  You've got to swing the mic around and then use it again. 
[01:20:30]  Now, don't do anything yet.  Put the mic in front of her face.  This is life, J.  This is life, baby.  All right.  Now, give us a little three, two, one countdown, and then just let it rip.  And don't be shy.  Really get in there.  She's in here.  You're not going to fart at your night.  Oh, I'd love it if she fart at her.  Oh, good.  I would like to.  I would like to.  Let me see.  This is horrific.  So, Brian, do you like watching fishing on TV?  Speaking of fishing, look at it. 
[01:21:00]  The throat.  Do you have any fart sounds?  Huh?  No.  See, next time.  Now, don't you worry.  Just get on the mic.  On the show, you will hear fart.  Get on the mic.  Bend over.  By the way, I'm on Manhattan Neighborhood Network.  All right.  All right.  Shut up.  Saturday night at...  No, give her the mic.  But tell her to show up.  1057.  There you go.  1230.  Last time she bent over to show her hemorrhoids, she farted in poor Steve's face.  And he loves you.  All right.  Phil?  Phil?  Yes.  He's a very kinky guy. 
[01:21:30]  Apply the appointment.  Look at Phil.  Now, go ahead.  Now, really get in there.  Get a good one.  Oh, my Lord.  All right.  Ready?  I don't believe this.  Give her the mic.  You need to spread those cheeks.  This never happened before.  I feel like my act alone.  I feel like my act alone.  It's a show world.  I don't believe you.  Three.  But alone.  All right.  Here we go.  I don't believe it.  Oh, no.  I don't believe it.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no.  It's your career, Ma. 
[01:22:00]  Don't.  You know.  You take it seriously.  That could be the best child ever.  I don't believe it.  You know, the good thing about this is it's going to completely erase the memory of guys  eating rats.  It'll be completely whitewashed from my mind.  I don't believe it.  That's very true, though, so.  I got to hear that before we leave.  Are you ready?  Just go.  Do it already.  Go ahead.  I really would like Jay to do it.  I mean, then I could say someday, Jay Moore, touch my hemorrhoid. 
[01:22:30]  Go ahead.  What action?  Bill, touch her hemorrhoid.  Oh!  Wow.  That just happened.  That just happened.  Wow.  He's not very gentle.  I don't know.  He's not very gentle.  He went for a good one.  That last one, he gave her a good poke.  He gave her the poke-erizer.  He's not very gentle. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  He's not very gentle.  Is that you okay?  No, that's okay.  Oh, my God.  You look more gentle.  I don't care about any fire hazards.  Start a fire in here right now and burn that glove.  I don't care if the hell on goes off.  I'm going to give my turn to Brian.  I'll pass.  I'll pass.  I'll pass.  I'll pass.  The password is hemorrhoid.  It goes to Brian.  I'm going to pass.  I'll pass.  All right.  Well, well.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  I'm so glad that happened.  Do you want to go again?  Can I ask you a question?  One more time.  One more time.  That hemorrhoid must be pretty inspected or something the way you reacted by somebody touching it.  I think maybe you should seek medical attention.  That guy put his finger on it and he went, oh, like that night from Caddyshack.  Go to the hospital kind of noise.  Oh, you're no gentleman.  You must be able to apply ointment to a hemorrhoid without going, oh. 
[01:24:00]  How about a fresco?  Absolutely.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  You want to do one more application?  One more.  Oh, my God.  You're a really good one, Phil.  You want to make it perfectly clear that Brian is not checking this out.  That poor glove, you know, expected to be unwrapped by some nice housewife and washed a few dishes.  Now the glove's like, why me?  I'm sitting on the rack.  I get this.  I throw maybe a couple of teacups and I'd be put away in the cabinet. 
[01:24:30]  I don't like preparation agents, personally.  All right.  Let's go.  Ben, let's go.  Show the hemorrhoid.  Oh, jeez.  Phil, make sure.  What are you doing?  Phil, that's going to look good on your resume.  It's a real resume stuff.  What do you do for a living?  Phil, what do you do for a living?  In marketing.  There you go.  Is your mother listening?  I do.  It's my mother.  All right.  Everyone be quiet.  All right.  Get on mic.  There's a joke there.  You didn't catch it.  Give us a little countdown.  Bring it to your mother. 
[01:25:00]  Give us a three, two, one.  Hello.  Hello.  Here we go.  You hate women, my son.  This isn't right.  This is awful.  I can't even take it.  I'm turning myself in.  You hate women?  I'm turning myself in.  You're gentle, man.  I can't take it. 
[01:25:30]  You're gentle.  You're so a woman.  Oh, I'm so a woman, baby.  Brian, again, I apologize for this program.  But we learned a lesson.  If you want to show you like women, don't do what Phil did.  Don't use two fingers.  Fingers.  Man, you cut your nails.  She said Phil, she cut his nails.  The amazos Phil, the magician. 
[01:26:00]  She tried to...  Is in the room with us.  All right.  Listen, Sandy, we want to thank you for coming by.  That was Sandy.  Very good.  That's a hell of an act you got.  It's all right.  Can I give one more plug?  I think you've been plugged enough.  Poor Brian thought the rat sign was bad.  Now there's going to be a big hemorrhoid.  Touch the hemorrhoid.  All right.  He's one of our faves.  Brian, thank you so much.  Brian Regan in the house.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027. 
[01:26:30]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of OPNM.  1027 WNEW.  All right.  We're going to talk to the guy that was injured at a fast food restaurant.  Heard a similar story like the one that appears in the papers today.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  I was very injured.  Where were you injured? 
[01:27:00]  At a fancy coffee shop.  Okay.  I was drinking coffee.  You know how it makes you have to pinch a loaf?  Sure.  You drink too much.  Yeah.  I went to the bathroom.  Okay.  And I was very nervous.  Uh-huh.  And I had a loose stool.  Ah.  Very messy.  Yeah.  And I couldn't find the toilet paper.  Okay.  Like the gentleman you read about.  Yeah, in the paper today.  All right.  And I went to reach back, and like him, the toilet seat shifted.  Okay.  And snapped down on my penis like a bear trap. 
[01:27:30]  Now it's all flattened like a fruit roll-up.  I was screaming in pain.  Uh-huh.  And one of the workers came in and started laughing at me.  Why was he?  And my ass was still soiled.  And I'm suing.  It was...  I was degraded.  You were very degraded, huh?  Ugh.  Yeah.  And now I can't have coital relationships with my wife no more.  Well, were you having sex before the mishave?  Well, no. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, I see.  But now it's very embarrassing.  I see.  Because we tried.  Yeah.  And she was laughing at me, because when I got excited, it looked like one of those party favors.  It unrolled.  You ever see the kids' parties?  Oh, no.  My slug was passed apart.  And I lost my glasses.  What is it?  And my shoes.  You lost your glasses and shoes when you were injured.  And I spilled a hot coffee latte on my testicles. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  I got off the boat screaming, help me.  Yeah.  And I slipped in my own feces and fell on a toilet plunger.  And it impaled me in my back door.  Oh, we didn't need to hear that.  All the while, they were laughing at me.  Uh-huh.  They just said they'd get me a new coffee latte.  Right.  But I couldn't drink in the establishment with a plunger lodged in my rear end.  No, I don't think that would work.  My penis was damaged, damaged. 
[01:29:00]  I know.  That's what you said.  I hear you're suing for like $2 million.  $2 million.  Yeah.  I can only make love to a coin slot now.  It's damaged.  It's horrible.  I went to the hospital.  They laughed at me.  Yeah.  They wanted to hook it up to some kind of air pump at the gas station.  Pump some new life into that thing.  Try to be an easy inflate.  Sure.  Like a basketball pump.  Right.  And I said, oops, you're hurting me.  And they all laughed at my broiled testicles. 
[01:29:30]  I must say, you're a mess.  I'm suing.  Okay.  For $2 million over an injured pee-pee.  Oh.  Hey, can I speak to Anthony?  Pull that one off, smart ass.  Well, Anthony's smoking a cigarette, sir.  Stop it.  His mother doesn't want to hear that.  You'll be very angry.  If he learns he's even smoking.  Are you related to Anthony?  No, but I know his mother.  She'll be pissed. 
[01:30:00]  She'll be pissed if she knows that you're smoking a pack of gas.  And he's not smoking anymore.  He was smoking for a couple of weeks during a trying period in his life.  I see.  Shut the ass up.  I also have heard that Anthony may be freebasing at this point.  Don't even start those rumors.  All right.  I'll give in to the cigarette smoke.  Okay.  This is getting too real. 
[01:30:30]  Shut up.  So there's no truth to the freebasing rumors?  None.  Okay.  I don't know where that came from.  All right.  Tell me your stupid brother.  All right.  Your mom wanted to know.  That's all.  I figured we'd bring it up on the air today.  Whose mom?  Mine?  Anthony's mom.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's still busy smoking that cigarette, remember?  He's not smoking.  Shut up.  Oh, he's going to sue you.  Anthony will, my pal?  He doesn't smoke.  Okay. 
[01:31:00]  It was for a couple of weeks.  Okay.  But he quit again.  Well, whose cigarettes are these in the studio then?  Shut up.  They're not smoking.  There are no cigarettes in there.  If his mother hears, she's very angry.  Okay.  Oh, he's screwed.  You know, if Anthony's going to be smoking again, he really should buy the ones with filters.  They are.  They were.  They were filtered cigarettes.  I'm going to kick your ass. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  Well, thank you for calling in with this exclusive story.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Thank you.  I'm suing.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  107 WNEW.  Well, we got the Cod's in the studio.  The Cod's.  And also, live from L.A., it's Jay Moore.  Jay.  First weekly visit. 
[01:32:00]  What's up, Jay?  I don't know how Cod should be in the studio when he's here at my house.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's in the other room.  Cod.  Here, Cod.  Oh, no.  Is it on the phone?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pick up the other one.  Now, I would like to talk to you about my penis.  Now, you take your hand and you place it below my belt.  And you begin to force some of the goo. 
[01:32:30]  And it feels good.  And it's great to get.  And flizzum flopped the zibazoo.  Flizzum flew.  Stomp the penis back and forth.  And before you know it, flies his ship jack.  Fills some corn and fills some farn.  Farn, flizzum.  Oh, what's up, dude? 
[01:33:00]  It seems to Cod's in a little bit of trouble there.  No.  What's up, man?  Lachelle Covington, a 20.  That's been a rumor about Cosby for a long time.  What, that he likes grabbing girls' hands and shoving them down his pants?  Yeah.  That's great.  Did you read the story in L.A., Jay?  No.  Oh, this is a...  I'm sleeping till, uh, I'm still on Comic Time.  I'm sleeping till once.  Oh, this is a great story.  Lachelle Covington, she's been on the Cosby Show a few times.  Lachelle.  Lachelle.  Lachelle.  I don't know how to pronounce these names. 
[01:33:30]  Lachelle.  She's got Ricky Lake with that name.  Lachelle.  Lachelle.  That's a Ricky Lake name.  Yeah, she's been on...  Lachelle, when did you and Rat Tatooine know Latrine was Debris' baby?  Well, when I talk to Listerine...  Hold on, Kalua, it's Portia's turn.  La Manjula.  La Manjula.  Amphreni, please.  Amphreni.  Amphreni.  What was the thing?  Well, uh, she's an actress.  She's been on the Cosby Show, but she hasn't had speaking parts on the Cosby Show.  I wonder why.  Um, well, she went to Cosby's, uh, little house there. 
[01:34:00]  His little posh townhouse.  To his townhouse.  To get some, uh, acting advice.  Acting advice.  From the Cos.  That seems a little strange right there.  That's the best.  She goes to his house for a little acting advice.  She's a hoo-er.  A hoo-er.  Well, she filed a police report saying the beloved comedian put her hand under his T-shirt  and guided it south toward his sweater.  That's a crime?  That's a crime?  Built in fire.  What, uh, what law did he break?  You see, the penis is below the belt line, so I do want her to touch the penis. 
[01:34:30]  I put your hand on my belly bar.  I was hoping it would not stay where I put it.  What law did he break?  I was guiding her hand towards what I like to call Fat Albert.  Well, sometimes when I drink too much, he's Tom Donald.  Fat Albert and the Cosby kids hanging right below. 
[01:35:00]  I like to call my left nut Rudy and my right nut Bill.  Rudy's hanging a little lower because he's sad about being below Fat Albert.  If you stroke Rudy just right, the next thing you know,  Fat Albert starts dripping and sizzling all.  What am I?  Hey, Jay, I think Cosby wanted to play What's in My Pants, huh? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I say Porat was an afro, slightly shaved, and she dates a fireman because it has a brass knob.  And what law did he break?  Well, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office,  they decided no crime had been committed.  She pulled her hand away, and at that point, before that point,  it was a consensual little circumstance.  So the cops never questioned Cosby. 
[01:36:00]  However, the story gets better there, Jay Moore.  Oh, now she's going to sue him.  In the upcoming issue of the National Enquirer,  Covington's relatives are quoted saying Cosby went further grabbing her breasts,  trying to put his hand down her pants, and exposing himself to the young actor.  If that's the case, there's crimes going on on a daily basis right here in the studio.  I'm just going to say that.  That's the best thing.  Anthony and I, it's alarming.  Anthony and I think of the same show for like a 60% clip.  And it's like just 50-50. 
[01:36:30]  Who gets it out first?  It's alarming.  You want to hear more of the police report?  Because it is pretty funny.  But I don't understand what...  Putting a woman's hand on your belly...  Putting a woman's hand on your pants.  You know how many times...  You know what my trick was when you didn't think you were getting anywhere?  Yeah.  This works, guys.  Any guy listening, this would be great.  There we go.  There we go.  More advice.  Batten down the hatches.  More advice.  M-O-H-R advice.  Okay.  Hey, come on.  This is the guy that came up with...  I made two cousins cares.  Don't forget.  Absolutely. 
[01:37:00]  We'll never forget it.  All right.  When you're in the car making out, and you're like touching breasts,  and you're not sure what's going to happen, and you just...  You know, you could sit there until 5 in the morning making out.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  Yeah.  I mean, time, expedition is the key.  You want to be expeditious in the process of getting laid.  Right.  Because you're making out, and when you feel...  Don't just do it, like, right off the bat.  You've got to get it, like, hot and heavy.  You touch the breast, tweaking the nipples a little.  Then you take out...  It's got to be erect, gentlemen.  Don't take out the acorn.  Take out the rod. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  And you just let them see it.  You say, what are we going to do about this?  When they see it, sometimes when they see it, it's like...  They can't help it.  Yeah.  They're at least going to touch it out of curiosity, because they can't believe you...  The worst thing that's going to happen is they're going to make, you know, kick out of the car.  And then who wants to be able to screw it anyway?  It's a problem, though.  What are we going to do about this?  That's a...  Yeah, oh, look.  You know what that's what you do?  You're like, oh, my God.  Look how excited you get me.  You show them. 
[01:38:00]  Wow.  It's like it's a compliment.  That's a brave move, Jay.  That is a bold move, man.  I'm telling you it works, because when they see it...  Well, I don't know about...  Well, not Rick, because he's an egg roll.  But when they see most, you know, nice, handsome, circumcised penises, you know, they're women.  They like penises.  But if Rick takes out, like, an egg roll, they're going to be like...  I don't know about that one there.  Why don't you peel it yourself and get back to me?  I love the girls in the car, you're making out with them and stuff, and you want to go for patch,  and they have all those karate moves preventing you from getting down there. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  I didn't realize their arms can move like that.  Yeah, it's like they do their special...  I've been on the road.  What are we going to do about this?  Now, answer the question, I suppose, at about 1.15 a.m.  What are we going to do about my erect penis?  It looks like a Jell-O put-in-pop on it.  There you go.  Why don't you treat it like one, sir?  Phil's barn and Phil's... 
[01:39:00]  You're not fine.  Rudy never minded putting a hand down in the car's pants during the car's...  Little Rudy.  What a great story in the paper, isn't it?  Why does a 60-year-old girl have a mustache?  Rudy had a little dirty Sanchez going there.  I can't believe a 65-year-old man trying to get pussy is news.  It's a 20-year-old chick, and he's like putting his hand down... 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, but what else do you do when you're worth a billion dollars and you're 65 years old?  You'd think he could be a little smoother than that, though.  He's in his swank townhouse in his big, stinky, Cosby sweatpants.  Repeat that.  With his big belly.  Repeat the first part of your sentence.  He's in his posh townhouse.  Yeah, she came to him.  Yeah, that's true.  But I mean...  You know what, though?  If he probably would have had just a tad more class, it would have worked. 
[01:40:00]  What, if he kissed her on the mouth?  I don't know.  I don't know what the move is, but I don't think it's grab her hand and put it in your pants.  Yeah, Jay, what's the move?  I told you what the move is you make out when it's fully erect.  Take it out.  What are we going to do about this?  You're joking at yourself and say, look how excited you make me.  What are we going to do about this?  Crazy.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  I'm in pain.  I'm in pain.  What are we going to do about this?  It just sounds like a problem. 
[01:40:30]  It's so funny.  What are we going to...  Oh, look at this.  Geez, I've got to take this back to the shop.  What are we going to do about this?  No, then you start doing it yourself and they're like...  Then they feel stupid that they're just sitting there watching you masturbate.  Well, you know what?  It's powerful hockey.  Take it from the man.  Brilliant.  Brilliant move.  Somebody's going to try that move.  Bravo.  You know what's funny?  Oh, he's going to try it on his girlfriend where he doesn't even have to try it.  What are we going to do about this?  Oh, he'll be making out tonight and just take it out and be like, oh, what are we going to do about this?  Put that away. 
[01:41:00]  What?  Put it in me.  What are you talking about?  I'm going to try the what are we going to do about this lie.  I encourage all our listeners to try the what are we going to do about this lie.  Yeah, try it.  Let us know how it works.  You single dad.  It's got to be like, oh, my God, you're in so much pain because it's so bad in your pants.  Hold on.  And this girl, Kelly, says this trick works.  It's true.  I'm going to put you on with Kelly, Jay.  And it's strong.  Kelly.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Lovely.  Great.  It does work.  Really?  Because when you see a good looking penis, you want to take care of it.  It is so true.  And I can tell you from experience, it's very true. 
[01:41:30]  It has happened many times.  Well, the way you're talking, it sounds like you're doing one right now.  No, actually, right now, I'm on my way to work.  I'm going to, like, deep s*** in my blood.  Oops.  Oh, watch that curse word.  Sorry, but I'm really deep.  No cursing.  You can't curse.  Hey, Kelly, Kelly, what are we going to do about this?  I don't know.  I have to come visit.  I guess you have to be in the same room, right, Jay?  It works better when you're there with the person.  Yeah.  All right.  Kelly.  Yeah?  Why does it work? 
[01:42:00]  Is it because you see it and you're already excited and there's the sight of it?  Make sure you do something about it?  If you're making out for, like, five hours and you haven't done that,  yet, you're in serious problems, okay?  But I'm thinking after an hour of making out, you should be doing it by then, okay?  Or less than an hour.  For me.  When you see it fully erect, you almost feel guilty for the gun.  If the guy starts stroking it himself, you're going to be like,  all right, get out of the way, let me do it.  All right.  You don't knock right away.  You've talked to them for a while.  Chalk it up. 
[01:42:30]  I'm going in.  It works, though.  All right, Kelly, thank you.  You're welcome.  Well, look at that.  How drunk was that girl?  This girl, Joanne, says that your trick works.  One more lady that says the game works.  You know, you guys didn't believe me when I invented the trick.  No, I didn't.  That's a ballsy move.  Joanne.  Hello.  Hi.  All right, Jay, that trick has worked so many times on me, it's not even funny.  Wow.  That's something you want to, you know, tell everybody.  So many times.  Your uncles are going to start pulling it out.  So, what, you're making out with a guy, you're getting hot and heavy, 
[01:43:00]  he pulls out his junk and says, what are we going to do about it?  And it works for you, huh?  And let me tell you, it's like, okay, I'll be a good girl tomorrow.  Wow.  You know, you go along, you're going to say, you're saying, I'm going to behave myself.  No, this is not going any further.  Yeah.  I'm going to remain calm.  We're just going to end the night nicely tonight.  It's going to be good.  I'm going to be, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He takes it out, and the next thing you know, it's just irresistible.  That's right.  It's a beautiful sight. 
[01:43:30]  It truly is.  Some filth and floss.  When they see it, you guys don't realize that it's actually an attractive thing to women.  It is a weapon.  Well, that was a storyline, episode 54, where my tall seal that trick.  He went out and pulled out his stuff and felt the barn.  Put your hand down with the big sweaty sweatpants of the cause and felt the barn.  I applaud the cause.  I think if you're a billionaire and you work as hard as he has, as long as he has, 
[01:44:00]  and a girl comes to your house, and you put her hand on your belly, your big old belly,  and take care of some business, I think he's done nothing wrong,  and I think this country's gone bananas with this.  Where do you draw the line between sexual harassment and trying to get laid?  Where do you think she's trying to get laid?  Yeah, but you know something?  She came over to your house for acting advice.  She honestly knew what the deal was.  I'm just saying a little more couth.  Maybe she didn't right away want to plunge down at his 60-year-old. 
[01:44:30]  Couth?  You know who needs couth?  60-year-old.  All these poor guys need couth.  Melted Turkish packing nuts.  With a billion dollars, you don't need couth.  You pull down your pants and go, hey, play with this.  I'm worth a billion.  I own the little rascals.  I own the little rascals.  I want you to grab my buckwheat.  You need her.  I mean, look, my little stymie's out here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:45:00]  That doesn't sound so bad.  Booyah!  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  1027 WNEW.  All right, why don't we play the Arnold Schwarzenegger prank call?  Yeah, let's hear these.  These are great.  One of our listeners turned us on to these damn things,  and they're really, really funny.  Someone out there, we don't even know who to give credit to,  they're playing Arnold's sound bites. 
[01:45:30]  Sound clips, yeah, from his movies or an interview or something.  And the person on the phone is just responding to Arnold.  Responding to a tape.  Yeah, a tape.  All right, here's the first one that we played last week.  Instigator Lodge.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How are you?  I'm all right.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Okay.  Who is your daddy, and what does he do?  Who?  Who is your daddy?  Who are you talking about?  Who are you? 
[01:46:00]  Well, who are you?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Hey, this is a motel.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, if you're a cop, you idiot, come over here and talk to me, okay?  You son of a bitch.  And I don't know what he does.  This is a switchboarder to the Gator Lodge.  Stop it.  I don't stop nothing, you idiot.  Stop it.  I love it.  You know, we got to record it.  I'm Detective John Kimball. 
[01:46:30]  You can't even talk.  So that's the one we've been playing off and on for the last week.  Yes, Rick?  Right.  That's the one we found last week.  Somebody sent it to us.  I forget who it was, but thanks to whoever you are.  And then we went on to Napster and found more.  Mm-hmm.  That was on Napster?  Yeah.  Nice.  So this one's a phone call done to Hooters.  Yeah, this is pretty good, too.  This is a good one?  Yeah.  All right.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Prank calls.  Ron Henderson, this is Kay.  How can I help you?  How are you?  Good.  First, I would like to just get to know you. 
[01:47:00]  Get to know me?  Yeah.  Well, I'm sorry.  You son of a bitch.  What?  Stop whining.  Stop whining?  Yeah.  I'm not whining.  What are you talking about?  Who are you?  I'm someone that works at this restaurant.  You lack discipline.  What?  You lack discipline.  Do I like discipline?  Yes.  You need to call a different line.  This is editor.  That is great. 
[01:47:30]  That is funny, man.  If the one that makes that is what he just says.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting another one queued up here.  George, what's up?  Yo.  Yo.  Yo, it's Sean, not George.  All right.  Yo, what's up, guy?  Yo, that is the funniest you ever played.  That's hysterical.  I think he said the S.  No, I didn't.  The funniest S ever played.  Cool.  All right.  We're good.  All right.  Yeah, that is funny stuff, man.  Someone should go to line three because they're turning us on to other prank calls done by other people. 
[01:48:00]  I like the first one, too.  If we say it, you know, other people are going to get it before we can.  Who is your daddy?  All right.  We got two more.  Stop whining.  What's this one, Rick?  Arnold calls some barbecue place?  Yeah, it's called Cotton's Barbecue.  Cotton's Barbecue.  All right.  This is a really good one.  All right.  Carl.  You son of a bitch.  How are you?  All right. 
[01:48:30]  Who do you want to do?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Charles Kimball?  Yes.  This Cotton's Barbecue.  I used to Charles Kimball?  Yeah.  I used to somebody named Charles Kimball.  Charles Kimball.  So could you describe Charles Kimball?  Yes.  Could you tell me how Mr. Kimball looks?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Detective.  Oh, he's a Detective John Kimball.  Hey, I'm a police officer.  Oh.  I'm a cop, you idiot. 
[01:49:00]  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Oh, excuse me, sir, but this is Cotton.  Glad to be this is not a police station.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  It sounds awesome.  That is so good.  Greg, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm checking to see if those clips are going to be on Foundry Music later.  Yeah, we should put them on FoundryMusic.com for you guys.  Definitely.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Oh, man.  Okay.  That one is hilarious.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Danny, what's going on? 
[01:49:30]  What's happening, man?  Yo, that is the scream, dude.  That is one of the funniest things you guys ever played, man.  My God.  Right on, man.  Right on, dude.  Yo, all right.  That's a lot, man.  All right, we're getting the last one queued up here.  Dan, what's going on?  Nothing, man.  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  That's great.  I don't want to find out where I can get that on Naps, sir.  Type in Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Yeah, try that, or go to FoundryMusic.com, I think.  Right, Steve?  They're on the site right now, and they were done by a group called Holy Outlaws, I believe. 
[01:50:00]  So they're all there.  They're already on your site?  Yeah, they've been there for about a week.  Where are they?  Under the files?  Soundclips.  Soundclips.  They're all MP3s.  They're all there.  FoundryMusic.com.  Go to Soundclips.  Let's see.  Okay, we got the fourth one.  Preferred Realty?  Yeah.  All right.  Most Preferred Realty.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions, and I want to have them answered immediately.  Is this Dave?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Yeah, sure you are. 
[01:50:30]  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, how about I come over here and I'll whoop your goddamn ass.  How about that?  Yeah.  All right?  You son of a bitch.  That's great, man.  Call me that.  You got a problem?  Get over here.  Otherwise, get off of the phone and quit being an idiot.  But I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach.  I will go back. 
[01:51:00]  That is great.  Wow.  That is great.  Arnold loses his mind in that one.  That's hilarious.  Leo, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just found out that Arnold Schwarzenegger is actually funnier on this tape than he is in the movie.  He is, no doubt.  He's unbelievable.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Thanks, Leo.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Which one do you want to hear again real fast? 
[01:51:30]  The Hooters one.  It's hilarious.  They're all good.  I don't know.  The Preferred Realty is my favorite.  Well, screw it.  We'll play all three again.  I don't care.  Here's Hooters.  Well, where'd you go?  Over here.  Thanks for going to Hooters to you today.  This is Kay.  How can I help you?  How are you?  Good.  First, I would like to just get to know you.  Get to know me?  Yeah.  Well, I'm just sorry.  You son of a bitch.  What?  Stop whining. 
[01:52:00]  Stop whining?  Yeah.  I'm not whining.  What are you talking about?  Who are you?  I'm someone that works at this restaurant.  You like discipline.  What?  You like discipline.  Do I like discipline?  Yes.  You need to call a different line.  This is Hooters.  She doesn't even get it right.  Do I like discipline?  I can't understand Arnold.  Hey, Randy.  You like discipline.  Hey, Randy.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, man?  That Arnold stuff's pretty good.  Yeah.  I was just wondering if either one of you guys or somebody else go into production and mix 
[01:52:30]  up those Arnold clips for some of Rick on the phone from the Voya bus.  You could get a pretty good thing out of that, you know?  You know, you're probably right.  We'd take some of those and get Rick's answers from the bus when he was getting arrested.  I'm too idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Uh-oh, the cops are here.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Go on, man.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  Take it easy.  Let me go to Bob.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  Hey, help me.  How are you?  Everyone's here.  What's up? 
[01:53:00]  I remember you a long time ago.  I used to call you every night.  What is this?  But anyway, going back to what I said, you've got to stop this.  I just had a double hernia operation.  Yeah.  And you're making the stitches pop out.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Bob.  All right, bye.  We've got the preferred realty again.  A ton of people are saying just play them over and over again.  Yeah, I know.  Here we go.  The preferred realty.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Who's this, Dave?  I'm Detective John Kimball. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, how about come over here and I'll whoop your goddamn ass.  How about that?  Yeah.  All right?  You son of a bitch.  That's great, man.  Call me that.  You got a problem?  Get over here.  Otherwise, get off of the phone and quit being an idiot.  But I hope you'll leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to have it in your stomach.  I will be all back.  That is the best line.  That is the best friggin' line, man. 
[01:54:00]  Lewis, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  All right, I ran off the curb on the parkway.  I hit the thing.  I scratched up my Camaro.  They're funny, man.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  It's funny.  Yeah, they're really funny.  Goddamn.  Tony, what's up?  Dude, man, how stupid are these friggin' people?  It's a sale.  Dude, you know what you got to do?  Huh?  Get some clips from Conan the Barbarian.  Yeah.  Him and the guy are walking through the village and the hookers are bothering him. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Arnold turns around and goes, ah, you old slut.  And they have the crumb one, and then he goes, who do you pray to?  And the other guy goes, the four winds.  Yeah, not a bad idea.  All right, Tony, thank you.  Guys rule, man.  All right.  That is so damn funny.  Here's the Cotton's Barbecue.  Cotton.  You son of a bitch.  How are you?  All right.  Who are you speaking with?  I'm Detective John Kimball. 
[01:55:00]  Charles Kimball?  Yes.  This is Cotton's Barbecue.  I ain't for Charles Kimball?  Yeah.  I ain't for somebody named Charles Kimball.  Charles Kimball.  Um, so could you describe Charles Kimball?  Yes.  Could you tell me how Mr. Kimball looks?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Detective.  Oh, he's a detective, John Kimball.  Hey, I'm a police officer.  Oh.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Oh, excuse me, sir, but this is Cotton's Barbecue. 
[01:55:30]  This is not a police station.  What an idiot.  He keeps saying he is the cop.  He doesn't even get it.  We got to find more of these.  Those are great.  I hear there's a bunch of them out there.  Yeah.  Oh, look at it.  I'm leaving the room for my face.  Now you get, like, the calls from people that go, oh, I know the guy that does this.  Remember when the Jerky Boys first came out?  Yeah.  Everyone knew who they were. 
[01:56:00]  No, it's a friend of my brother's cousin, I swear.  We got to get more, though.  Well, we got the original one that we had last week.  We'll play this and we'll take a break, okay?  Cool.  I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions and I want to have them answered immediately.  Okay.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  Who?  Who is your daddy?  Who are you talking about?  Who are you? 
[01:56:30]  Well, who are you?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Hey, this is a motel.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, if you're a cop, you idiot, come over here and talk to me, okay?  You son of a bitch.  And I don't know what he does.  This is a switchboard at the Gator Lodge.  Stop it.  I don't stop nothing, you idiot.  Stop it.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[01:57:00]  212-757-1027.  It's the O&A Show on WNEW.  On the phone, Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, which way now?  What?  What's that?  What?  What'd you say?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Anthony, explain.  Which way?  Anthony, explain that whole thing the other day.  Which way?  Anthony, explain what?  Which way what?  No, not which way what?  Which way?  Medium or well done? 
[01:57:30]  Medium.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well done.  Uh-uh.  Well.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  I gotta know.  The way I like it.  Medium rare.  Right.  What the hell are you talking about?  You see what that mean, Opie?  What does that mean?  That's what you do now.  Medium or well done?  Simple question.  That's what you do now. 
[01:58:00]  But why rare?  Uh-uh.  There's only one answer?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Opie, you're a smart guy.  Medium.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  Right.  How come Anthony knows the answer?  That was me who knew the answer.  Opie, I gotta know now.  Yeah.  I only ask one more time.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Uh, medium rare.  Right.  That's me twice in a row. 
[01:58:30]  What does that even mean?  What does that mean?  How do you like it?  It's simple.  It's self-explanatory.  Why do you even ask that?  And why is medium...  What's so good about medium rare?  Right.  Medium rare is where it's at.  I understand.  What are you talking about?  I understand perfectly.  What if you like medium well because of the mad cow disease?  Or the foot and mouth thing?  No, huh?  How do you even know what I'm talking about?  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[01:59:00]  You're saying...  Now you're guessing something that you don't even know what you're getting involved in.  I just know...  This is where I stand now.  I know I like...  See, that's where it falls apart for me.  I know I like medium rare.  You're right.  Well, what are you talking about?  What I did was ask a question.  Yeah, it's an interesting question.  I haven't talked in a while.  I was thinking about it.  I call in.  I say which way medium or well done.  And you're going, that's the only way you like it?  Dice, what about you?  Which way you like?  How do you like it?  How do I like what? 
[01:59:30]  How do you like it?  Is that medium or well done?  No, you didn't ask the question.  How do you like it?  No, that's not it.  How do you take it?  No.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Which way?  Which way?  You don't even answer it.  No, I ask the question now.  Which way?  Medium or well done, Dice?  No, no.  I said it.  All right.  Medium rare.  All right.  Let's knock it off.  I haven't talked to you in a bad way.  We want to know.  I want to know how you like it.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well, you.  Which way?  Medium or well done? 
[02:00:00]  You're not saying it right.  How did you...  You're going to ask a question.  You're going to say it the right way.  Dice, which way?  Medium or well done?  That's what's the part for me.  I don't mind answering the question.  Which way?  Because you're going to say it the right way.  I got it the right way.  I got it the right way.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Dice, I got it.  I got it.  Here it is.  All right, go ahead.  Which way do you like it?  No, no, no.  Right.  Dice, which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare?  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  No.  No.  Uh-uh.  No, I said it to you.  You said what?  You said what to who?  No, I didn't say this is where I stand.  That's what I said.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Well done.  No, you got to say it quick.  Well done.  Eh.  That's a nah on that.  Medium rare?  Medium rare?  That's a nah.  Medium rare?  That's a nah.  Which way?  Medium or well done? 
[02:01:00]  Medium rare.  Right.  You see what I mean?  No.  No.  How did you understand that?  You're insane.  How am I insane when you didn't know the answer?  Why do you just start a conversation?  Which way?  Why is it that every time I call you, I ask you a simple thing and you don't have a simple answer?  That it's got to turn into a whole thing.  I don't know what's wrong with medium.  I have a feeling you have problems.  I don't have a problem.  You have a little problem there.  I had a nice weekend.  You had a good weekend?  Hey, I was in Vegas.  My butt butter was flying all over the joint. 
[02:01:30]  Everybody was laughing.  You know what I mean?  What's butt butter?  Eh?  Butt butter.  That's radio terminology for Benoit ball blaster.  You know what I'm talking about.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I think.  Yeah.  All right.  So what did you do?  Because remember you called me for that love advice.  Did I call?  I called you to say hi and you weren't home.  No, not you.  What?  No, you called me.  I was in Vegas.  Right.  Which way? 
[02:02:00]  Medium or well done?  Medium or well done?  Obviously.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  You see what I'm saying?  I see it now.  You know, but I told Anthony I was in Vegas.  All right.  So isn't it funny you called me when I was there?  Well, that means that and I aren't communicating.  I didn't.  How come?  What's going on?  I didn't know you were in Vegas.  You called me.  By the way, guys, who gave me my number?  What do you mean?  How did you get my new phone number?  I moved.  I had to reach out.  How'd you get it?  I had to reach out.  To who?  Not to who. 
[02:02:30]  To what?  Who gave you my number?  Because I left strict instructions not to give guys my new number.  No, he didn't give me anything.  Who gave it?  Rick?  Who?  Gave you my new phone number.  He's the doctor.  You know what I'm talking about.  Come on now.  Why can't we ever get anything to say?  Why is he the doctor?  Who's the doctor?  Rick?  Not Rick.  Who's the doctor?  Nice.  Who gave you my phone number?  It's a simple question.  I had to reach out. 
[02:03:00]  Reach out to who?  Who?  No.  Who wouldn't even know?  Do you understand?  And I'm not doing a routine.  That's his name.  I thought you were doing a little Aberdeen Costello there.  No, Doctor Who.  Doctor Who?  Yeah, but he don't know you.  So I don't know where you'd bring him up.  I think Rick gave you my number.  No, Rick didn't give anything.  I haven't even talked to Rick.  It wasn't me.  I reached out.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm allowed to say over the air.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I don't know who could have gotten the number. 
[02:03:30]  If we learned anything through history.  Keep quiet.  I'm on the phone.  Can't you see I'm talking to somebody?  Get out of here.  Who's that?  My wife.  She's a nice lady.  Huh?  Yeah, but she's starting to end.  She came in.  She wanted the keys for something.  Who was it?  Norton?  No.  A boyfriend.  Who was it?  Jay Moore gave you my number?  No.  Oh, your number?  You're still on your number?  Yeah, who gave the number?  Was it Jay?  Let me ask you this now.  It's Jay Moore did.  Let me ask you this. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Okay?  Why?  Why are you asking me now?  Because now I want to know who gave you the number.  For now, you call me up.  How do I keep things going?  I know you're with the same girl for years.  Call me up.  Do you remember?  Guys, I wouldn't even know where to call you.  What do you mean you wouldn't know where to call me?  You call me all the time.  I wrapped up in a thrilling game of EverQuest, and you call up, and I have to cradle the phone  in my shoulder, I feel I can play.  How do you get naked during that game?  It's not a naked game.  It's not a naked game.  You were playing this with your girlfriend? 
[02:04:30]  It's online gaming.  Are you playing this with your girlfriend?  It's on the computer, Dice.  Yeah.  Was she playing, too?  No.  And she was fully clothed.  She didn't take nothing off.  Yeah, what, am I supposed to have sex when Dice is on the phone?  No, no, no.  But you got it going.  I'm like fourth way for you, you know.  What an erection kryptonite that is.  Yeah.  All you got to do is think about me, and everybody gets excited about everything.  I can't even have one of your movies on the TV on the couch when we're trying to go at it.  Why not?  Because you're like a erectile kryptonite. 
[02:05:00]  You look up all of a sudden, hey, that's a good one.  You throw a one for me, okay?  And that's all you're thinking.  But that's all it's about.  That's all marriage and relationships are about.  That's what's bad, though, about having people in show business that you know.  Because, you know, you're ever trying to do something on the couch with your girl,  and all of a sudden I turn on Comedy Central, and there's Adam Ferrara.  Hey, pal, I see your ass.  You're naked, pal.  You don't want to see that.  Yeah, but it's like you remember all my personalities when you watch me. 
[02:05:30]  You know, which is kind of hot.  But, you know, you don't want to sit in there while you're trying to get your F on.  Are you trying to say your own address is hot?  I don't know if you did a donation.  I want to ask.  You know what I'm saying?  Say that again.  Adam Ferrara isn't Diamond Dice Gray.  Well, you can say it out of here.  You've got to know how to keep it going.  That's all I was trying to explain to you last night.  Who said what?  You know what I mean?  No, I didn't say who said what, and who had nothing to do with it.  You know what I mean? 
[02:06:00]  That's a whole different situation.  When you say you know what I mean, I can always answer no.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So, you know, you've got to constantly keep balls coming at them.  That's all I'm saying.  You've got to be on them from the minute they move in with you.  You can't let them, so I bring them in the boom closet, and I'm going, oh, look, it's not rising the way I would like it to.  Do me a favor.  You know what I mean?  Caress it a little.  And then when it's starting, go feed the turkey to the family. 
[02:06:30]  You know what I mean?  Not at all.  You know what I mean?  They wake up in the morning.  What's the first thing somebody does?  They wake up.  They yawn, right?  Yeah.  So the banana goes right in our mouth.  You've got to be prepared.  You've got to sleep with your head at that seat, so when they hug you in the middle of the night, the banana goes right in our mouth.  Oh, damn.  You see what I mean?  That's romance.  That's showing a girl, I'm always stinking about you.  Of course.  Nice.  You know what I mean?  You send them a nice card.  Remember when you drank my goo from a cup? 
[02:07:00]  I'm sorry.  Please let's make up.  That kind of thing.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Romantic.  It's always just coming at them.  They don't breathe.  You break the light like in the shower or something, so when they get in in the morning, you're already ready.  You're like in the corner.  You know what I mean?  Hey, good morning.  Bend the cat over here now, you filthy animal.  Hey, Dice.  And then you say to her when it's all over, right?  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  Now you understand.  Dice, I've got to be careful with this.  Dave on line eight, he wants to know if you've had a stroke recently.  What?  What happened?  What?  I'm actually coming in there to see you guys soon again.  Yeah, I hear that.  Yeah, huh?  You got a call waiting because something clicked in there.  I have to tell him how handsome he is.  I haven't told Dice how handsome he is.  Oh, I am getting beeped.  So I have to call him and tell him he's handsome.  And why is the guy using my yambag line? 
[02:08:00]  We love the yambag.  The guy that called Ben.  No, we came up with that.  We've totally stolen yambag.  Yeah, we came up with that.  Have you really?  We'll fess up to it.  Yeah, we stole it.  Do you understand how difficult it is to keep coming up with terminologies for you?  Dice, we came up with that one.  No, I came up with that.  When the yambag is banging against the hairy taco.  Yeah, remember when you were in here?  You remember?  And that was online?  Remember when we were saying yambag and you took it and then you used it the next time you were here?  The yambag is mine. 
[02:08:30]  Yambag is ours.  No, yambag is mine, my friend.  No, you got butt butter.  Butt butter is yours.  Butt butter is yours.  Yambag is ours.  No, no, no.  We got both mine.  We can trade if you like.  We'll take butt butter and you can have yambag back.  Yeah, but you ever made a chick with ascitis?  What's ascitis, thanks?  You get it from mad cow disease.  I never heard of ascitis.  What are the symptoms?  Well, you know, it's like faggotitis.  It's only if you go with a cow.  I don't get it. 
[02:09:00]  Get what?  What is it?  It's a disease.  It's spreading from the homemade cow disease thing.  Hey, you know, yambag was mine, you son of a bitch.  Yeah, all right.  Wait, don't start with the buttons.  You're stealing from a puppet.  Don't start with the buttons.  I'm a puppet.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Stop it.  Die.  Die.  All right, stop with the buttons.  I hate when you do the buttons.  Die.  Get in the coffin.  You know how I hate the buttons.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare. 
[02:09:30]  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Saget.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  You're right.  Don't forget, my friend.  I'm pussah.  Yambag is ours.  No, yambag, you know what?  I'll give you yambag.  How's that?  And we're going to take butt butter, too, if you don't watch it.  No, you can't take butt butter.  I can't keep coming up with these things.  Hey, why don't you take leather Cheerio, too, if you don't watch it?  Stop with the noise.  Stop with the noise now.  Get in the coffin.  I haven't talked to you for a while. 
[02:10:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I better put some butt butter on my, on my, on my, I can't even say the word that I was looking for.  Leather Cheerio?  That was an aceline.  Aceline.  You like that one?  You like that one?  I'll take that one.  All right, but I want your yambag back.  No, we're going to trade for that one.  I'll trade you aceline.  We'll give you a yambag.  Aceline.  Trading my material, sir.  Trading mine, sir.  Get in the coffin. 
[02:10:30]  We'll take aceline.  Aceline's nice, right?  Yeah.  Aceline.  We'll give you butt, we'll give you butt butter back.  Like, like if you're having that kind of, um, uh, how do you say it?  Anthony, say it, like what I mean.  Why?  You know, like if you're having that kind of backdoor action.  Yeah, like backdoor action, now what are you giving her?  Aceline.  Aceline.  Yeah.  Well, no, you need the aceline before you do that.  No, no, no, that's a different thing. 
[02:11:00]  That, you know, that's spit.  You know, aceline is what comes from your three-piece set.  Aceline, that's a good one.  No talent, faggot.  George.  Who's this?  What do I got to deal with that?  That's George from Otto and George.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are they up there?  Yeah, that's not nice.  He's a little shy, though.  You ever see him, the puppet guy?  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Yeah, wait, you'd lose my number.  Lose it.  No, he's not a bitch at sampling stuff.  Because Otto does talk once in a while. 
[02:11:30]  He doesn't want to talk today.  How come?  I don't know.  You want butt butter back?  We'll take aceline.  You like it?  You're thinking about aceline.  You can have the butt butter back.  You're thinking about aceline.  You know what, I'm going to give you some time to think about this.  We keep yam bag, we keep banana juice.  No, banana juice is mine.  Well, no one knows that anymore.  Banana juice, what are you talking about?  It's on the album.  We've used it so much, now they think it's ours.  So we're going to keep that one.  So you're going through a whole thing today about respect, so I understand where you're 
[02:12:00]  coming from.  Just take balloon knot and take the trifecta.  All three.  Then the coffin.  We'll give you, we can trade you F-tard.  No, that's no good.  I've got to keep butt butter.  I've got to keep aceline.  I'm going to give you yam bag because that's getting kind of old.  Keep them all, sir.  Who cares?  No, you get butt butter back.  That's not the puppet.  I know Otto and George, and I know what his stupid puppet sounds like.  What are you doing that?  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet.  The puppet came in here, and the puppet is, the puppet, and it's not the puppet. 
[02:12:30]  That's what the puppet sounds like.  The puppet has the flu.  Could the puppet say something?  The puppet came here without Otto.  Now he doesn't want to say anything.  You insulted him.  That's not the puppet.  That's Madame.  Who's Madame?  Hailing flowers and Madame?  That's the puppet they used to put on television.  That guy's dead as a doorknob, isn't he?  Yeah, but the puppet's not. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, that's funny.  Calling me a faggot?  Oh.  I'm no faggot, sir.  All right.  What?  Is it Otto?  Is that you?  Otto's not here.  George is here.  Just the puppet.  It's just the puppet.  Otto's the puppet.  Just the puppet.  See, that's what happens with every great team.  Sooner or later, they start arguing.  They break up.  One wants to go their own way, do their own stuff.  You know what I mean?  It's amazing that the puppet is here by himself.  Now, I know what you're saying.  Yeah.  He's over there.  I'm over here.  And this is where I stand, because that's where it falls apart for me. 
[02:13:30]  He's a junkie.  Die.  That's not Otto's puppet.  That puppet is way too mean.  That puppet's got a death sentence.  It's the puppet.  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet without Otto.  I know my puppets, my friend.  It's not the puppet.  It's the puppet without Otto.  I know my puppets.  And we're keeping banana juice, and we're keeping, um, what was the other one?  Hey, you've got to remember now. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I've got to confuse you.  Which way, medium or well done?  Medium.  Rare.  Uh-huh.  No, you can't split it.  You have to have the single answer.  We tricked you.  Ah, see?  We tricked you.  Look at the way to trick you.  We just tricked you.  He said medium.  I said rare.  That was the right answer.  You didn't get the answer, my friend.  That wasn't the right answer.  No, that wasn't the right answer.  I didn't get the answer.  It's the response you're going for.  Here.  Let's do it normal now.  All right.  All right, because then I'm going to go.  I'll let you do what you've got to do with what you've got. 
[02:14:30]  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Medium or well done?  Your ass smells like hot garbage.  No, wrong.  Wrong.  Hot garbage.  I'll give you a crack over your frigging head.  You'll be part of my fireplace.  You don't shut your mouth.  Eat me, sir.  Eat me.  Eat me, sir.  That's what I've got to say.  Eat me, puppet.  All right.  Let him finish.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  All right.  You ready?  Medium or well done? 
[02:15:00]  Get in the coffin.  No, wrong.  Medium or well done?  Muzzle George for a minute.  We've got to finish with...  Kill yourself.  No, George.  Kill yourself, sir.  George.  Apulsar.  George, relax.  Apulsar.  You've got to work in that puppet.  Yes.  He is there.  Yes.  It's not just the puppet doing his own thing.  Well, it's just the puppet.  Yeah, you're a real whiz.  Stupid son of a bitch.  All right.  Go ahead.  Die.  Die.  Die, sir.  All right.  Let's...  Dice... 
[02:15:30]  Dice has got a lot of bent to banger.  Don't you feel that?  Dice...  Everything's very negative.  See, I call in all happy.  Dice, explain...  Give me a retard.  Give us the question.  Happy as a retard, sir.  Well, that's one puppet's opinion.  Dice, give us the question.  No, no, I'm not doing it.  I did it ten times.  You didn't do it right.  But the puppet got you pissed now.  No, but you know, just the fact that I'm having an argument with a puppet.  Don't let the puppet get you pissed.  No, no, but the puppet's like hurt my feelings. 
[02:16:00]  He keeps saying things to like...  That's what we're doing.  All right, we'll keep the puppet out of this.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right, you ready?  Yeah, we want to finish signing up now.  All right, which way?  Medium or well done?  Eat my ass.  No, see, he did it again.  That's not right.  You know what I mean?  And I feel kind of stupid talking to something that really doesn't even exist.  You know what I mean?  I want to hear Otto's voice.  I don't care if he talks a lot.  I got to know it's him.  Because that's the only puppet person I talk to.  He's not here. 
[02:16:30]  Just George came in.  I don't understand this.  What happened with them?  I don't know.  It's his new thing.  It's just he sends George out and he stays home.  It's his new thing.  Kind of like that whole medium rare thing.  This is what Otto's doing now.  He went out to buy crack and the pigs ate him.  Effing junkie.  Let me ask you guys.  Does he ever talk like as him?  No.  He never talks?  Not lately because this is the new thing.  This is what he does now.  Just the puppet.  Yeah.  Just the puppet.  He normally asks puppet questions. 
[02:17:00]  No.  He's just looking at us now and the puppet is kind of like looking.  No.  He asks the puppet a question.  The puppet answers.  That's what he used to do.  That's usually what happens.  But he's not here.  So now the puppet's just on his own.  Right.  And the puppet.  You know what?  The puppet needs Otto back because he's getting very angry.  The puppet's eyes are just moving around the room.  What's the problem with the puppet?  The puppet's not getting enough work.  See, the puppet needs Otto.  Well, George is doing fine on his own. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  No, I don't think George is doing too good.  I'll tell you the truth.  The puppet's doing fine.  And why are we referring to an inadequate object as a person?  Wait.  I don't know, Dice.  Why would we do that?  I don't know.  Okay.  Look.  Why would three mature adults let us do that?  All right.  Finish up.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  I got to gear up.  Okay.  Which way?  Medium or well done? 
[02:18:00]  Why is nothing happening when I say that?  I was thinking of your answer.  What do you mean you were thinking of the answer?  I taught you the answer.  Oh, all right.  We've gone over this a thousand times today already.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Ah, pussah.  No, wrong.  All right.  The brain-damaged leather-clad freak.  You see what I mean?  Here he goes again.  The puppet just keeps getting angrier.  It's not my fault the puppet don't get work.  I know what Otto's thinking. 
[02:18:30]  Otto's doing like the teller thing, you know?  What's Otto doing?  He's working, day job, the whole thing?  Otto is like doing teller now.  Doesn't need to talk.  Giving B.J. for crack money.  I can't believe he won't talk.  Otto, is that you or is it the black puppeteer guy?  It's just the puppet.  No, there's another guy.  There's Willie and his puppet, whatever it is.  Oh, my God.  Willie and his puppet.  The black puppet.  Willie and Lester. 
[02:19:00]  Willie and Lester, right?  Willie and Lester.  The black puppet guy.  You ever hear those guys?  That's a puppet act.  That's a puppet act.  That's a puppet act.  He makes that puppet talk out of every hole in its body.  I kind of like the peanut guy.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Does Otto know Willie and Lester?  Did they ever get together, double date, that kind of thing?  I don't know.  Maybe when Otto comes in, he can tell us.  You want to ask George, though?  The black puppet rob me.  I'm not talking to the puppet anymore.  I will talk to Otto, but I won't talk to the puppet.  The black puppet robbed me once, sir. 
[02:19:30]  What happened?  The black puppet robbed me, sir.  Did the black puppet rob you?  You know, he took your best back because he's doing real good.  All right.  All right.  Look, I don't want to fight with a puppet.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Well, we have to take a break.  All right.  All right.  Take a break.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium rare.  That's what you do now.  All right.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Holy smoke.  He's out of his mind. 
[02:20:00]  The guy's lost his frigging mind.  What is that?  Which way?  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of OBNM.  1027 WNEW.  Make people go to your own show.  It's the O&A show.  212-757-1027.  I am so psyched to have Carlos Mencia on our radio show, Anthony. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  I've been jamming to your CD.  Jamming.  Whatever.  But, you know, listening to the latest Carlos Mencia CD is hilarious.  That's pretty cool, man.  All right.  It's a bit funny.  It's cool that, believe it or not, man, it's cool that it's like white guys saying that.  You know, because I swear to God, man, I'm in Texas so much.  It's always, you know, some Spanish, half English, you know what I mean, Steve?  You've got to go see him, man.  He's one of our people, you know what I mean?  It's like not even, it's not even funny at this point. 
[02:21:00]  It's just, you know, out of loyalty towards the cause.  You know what I'm saying?  Support the cause.  Support the beaner.  Yeah.  If you don't go out to see the beaner, then people aren't going to eat beans.  And then the people who plant beans aren't going to make any money.  And then what's going to happen to us?  You know what I mean?  It's like the whole circle of life for the beaners, man.  Right on.  I must say, he came in here and he figured it out.  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  Yeah, most brain players can't figure that out.  Most people can't figure it out for his life.  That was my friends, you know.  I go, Opie and Anthony.  I go, you know, so why can't an Italian guy? 
[02:21:30]  My super friend for me, Sally.  Oh, come on, dude.  Anthony doesn't, like, it doesn't really have to be an Italian guy.  Yeah, like Julio doesn't have to be a beaner.  Shut up, stupid.  If it was a white guy, it'd be like Tony, not Anthony.  Anthony is, like, Italian, man.  Yeah, true.  Right?  Yeah, you're right.  If it's Tony, maybe, but Anthony, when you say, when you're a guy, say, hey, my name's  Anthony, it always comes, see, I can't even say Anthony, like, hey, I'm Anthony.  You know, it's got to come out like that, right? 
[02:22:00]  Of course, of course.  Yeah, so, you know.  I never liked the Tony name, though, because it always came off like, Tony was always the...  Tony's like the retarded brother.  You don't know, friggin', you know, hey, hey, come on, huh?  We're going to go out tonight.  Right, he's the retarded one.  Have a good time, Mom, Tony, you mother...  And I'm like, I don't want to be, I'll be Anthony.  He's a little more refined.  Yeah, Tony's the one that says words like, doot-do-do, and everybody knows what he means,  you know what I mean?  Yeah, that guy's a doot-do-do.  Oh, yeah, doot-do-do. 
[02:22:30]  And people like me are like, what the fuck did you say?  What is that?  You know, it made me feel like I'm not an American, you know what I mean?  Is that some new word in the Webster's?  Doot-do-do.  I have no clue, man.  It's fun to go out, though, man.  I mean, it's like, it's been such a long journey for me just to be considered, like, funny.  You know what I mean?  We saw you years ago.  You're hilarious.  Yeah, but it's always like the Beener thing first.  Not with you guys. 
[02:23:00]  I'm just saying, like, wherever I go, it's always like...  Well, you don't see many Beener comics.  Well, you know.  I agree.  But you know what it is?  It's just that they cling to it.  There's black comics and white comics and this and that, but not many Mexican comics.  I think they cling to it, or Puerto Ricans or whatever.  But they cling to it is what it is.  You know what I mean?  They cling to that whole, you know, Puerto Ricans this and Mexicans this and white people that.  And they just do that over and over again.  You know what I mean?  It's like that movie.  What's that new movie where the white girl's dating the black guy? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  The black friends are hating on her.  And, you know, and I'm just like, does that s*** really happen anymore?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, but I mean, does it really happen?  Like, do I...  Dude, my chick is, like, from Oregon.  She's the whitest thing.  Yo, like, my chick, she'd be going out with you.  That's just like, you know what I mean?  When you see my chick, you know that dude is successful in something.  You know what I'm saying?  Or he's a pimp, because this chick is just...  Carlos, the funny thing is, we should swap, because my girlfriend's Puerto Rican, girl. 
[02:24:00]  She's going out with Puerto Rican, girl.  Do they ever look at you weird, though?  I never get it.  The family does.  Her family?  A little bit, yeah.  Maybe.  But you know what's funny is that I've encountered that, like, you know what I mean?  That white people are usually much more willing to be, like, it's cool, you know what I mean?  It's like the ethnic side that's usually a little, you know, hey, man, I'll come here dating him.  But, you know, my girl, so, like, my father was just like, you know, does she have a... 
[02:24:30]  How does her mother look, you know?  My dad was in with that, man.  Yeah, right.  It's just that I don't see it.  I go everywhere, dude.  I've been in Birmingham, Alabama, in the middle of the night at this place called the Waffle House with a bunch of rednecks.  Yeah, the old Waffle House.  And I walk in, and I've never, ever, like, had that look like, what the hell is Ed Boehner doing with our people?  You know, I've never seen it.  All of a sudden, there's a movie about it, and they're trying to make it like it's America, you know, the struggles, and then the white and the black, you know, we're bringing the racial issue. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I was like, didn't I see that, like, back in, like, 1970?  Yeah, although the sisters do get upset when they see a brother with a white chick.  Yeah, but that's only because, like, political correctness has gone to the point where, you know what, you turn on Oprah, right, and then you see a black guy dating a white girl, and all the audience was like, oh, and Loquisha was like, damn, why you got to be leaving us?  Why you got to be going with a white girl?  It has nothing to do with the fact that you got two, and each breast that you have weighs 300 pounds. 
[02:25:30]  It has nothing to do with the fact that your fat ass looks the way it does.  Nothing to do with that, of course.  Well, the white girl is hot.  You know, it's not like she's some fat girl.  I want my Tyrone every night.  It's not like that.  You know, she's a hot chick.  They're kissing her.  But then fat ass Loquisha, some other retarded white dude with, you know, with one tooth and a polio hat, you go, Loquisha, you go, girl. 
[02:26:00]  That's right.  That's right, girl.  You bring on that black love magic.  Bring it home, girl.  You know, it's like, it's so, like, you can say, you can, as long as you're dissing white people in America, you're cool.  You know what I mean?  It's the same thing you want about white people.  It's cool.  It's like, you say black, all of a sudden, you know what I mean?  We go through that on our show.  I know you do.  We make fun of everything, but as soon as you make fun of, you know, a Puerto Rican or a black guy or something, the phones explode. 
[02:26:30]  We opened up the show today talking about Jesse Jackson, and we got calls from people going, why do you have to make this a race issue?  We didn't even bring up, I think people know Jesse's black.  We brought up the fact that he couldn't keep his ding in his pants, and he got a chick pregnant.  But then all of a sudden, it's like, well, now you're talking about Jesse.  So we're going to get flat from that because he's a black guy.  Right.  No.  You can't talk about Jesse.  Because he's a hypocrite.  Stay out the bushes. 
[02:27:00]  That's what he should have done.  Stay out the bushes.  I think it's hilarious, man.  It really is great.  People love this.  But it's funny because here's a guy who's like walking around telling everybody how to be righteous.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Well, the whole time, and the only reason why he got it, he put the story out is because they caught him and they were going to put it on like an inquirer.  Yeah.  So it's not like the guy actually came on and said, you know, whatever.  Jesse, we got you.  Yeah.  He was forced to say something.  He was forced to do it.  And this guy was counseling Clinton when Clinton was going through his thing. 
[02:27:30]  His chick was four months pregnant.  In the picture.  There's a picture of her next to him.  He's four months pregnant while he's counseling him.  But I think what he's telling him is, is the bitch pregnant?  I think that's what he was talking about.  I don't think he was counseling him.  I think he was telling him, listen, this is what you do.  Give him $10,000.  Keep him quiet, man.  He did say Clinton said he felt better after Jesse left after the talk because Jesse probably did go, hey, man, you could be me.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:28:00]  This bitch is pregnant.  Yeah, exactly.  And I brought it just so you could look at it.  Yeah, that's probably what he did, man.  I want you to know I got her pregnant.  I want to hear that guy having sex.  See, that to me is funny.  Now you can picture it, though.  No, see, no, but to hear it, to see it, oh, yeah, oh, uh-huh, yeah.  Give it a comment.  See, that's funny to me.  Now, I'm sure some black guy is going to call.  And you know it's not a black guy.  Black people are laughing their ass off.  It's some politically correct white ass who wants to make the world better for the beaners and the sticks and the niggas of the world because they need to unite. 
[02:28:30]  You know, I swear to God, like, to me, it's all about whatever happened to, like, people, there's some people right now at work who have their radios really, really low.  Yep.  Especially right now because, you know, we're talking about race.  Sure.  Well, whatever happened to freedom of speech, man?  Whatever happened to, like, my dad came to this country so he could make a little more money and he could say, you suck.  Do you know what I'm saying?  All of a sudden you go to work and you can't say anything, man. 
[02:29:00]  You do a chick joke.  You're a woman basher.  You do a gay joke.  You know, and of all the people, of all the people to complain about jokes, fags are the worst.  I mean, completely.  Because if you can take a dick, you can take a joke.  You know, that's not even a joke.  That's just my motto, man.  Seriously.  That's like, you know, like, how could you say, you hurt me?  You, I hurt, dude, last night you had a, a big one. 
[02:29:30]  And you're, I hurt you.  Dude, how am I the, I'm the, dude, man.  You got to look at life a little different, man.  And, you know, it's just like people, you can't, you can't go there, you know.  Hey.  And any time there's a conflict between people of different races, like a white guy punches a black guy in the face is a hate crime.  Maybe the guy was just an a-hole, you know.  Maybe they just got into a fight and he punched the guy in the face.  But everyone's got a label, everything, hate crimes and whatnot. 
[02:30:00]  But the truth of the matter is, maybe he was just an a-hole.  Well, why can't you just call somebody an a-hole?  You can't.  You know what I mean?  Why can't you, you're an a-hole?  You can.  If you're black and you call a black guy that, it's fine.  If you're white, you call a white guy that, it's fine.  But once you mix it up, oh, now you're a racist and it's horrible.  But you know what, white people, it's your fault, all right?  I want you to know that.  No, because you made it all politically correct to the point where, like, you know what I mean? 
[02:30:30]  No, nobody can say anything anymore.  I used to go on stage a long time ago and tell white people and tell Hispanics and blacks, too, listen, man, stop telling white people not to do these jokes.  All right, because I knew what was going to happen, and I swear to God it happened.  Last month, I went on a radio show, and they told me, you can't do jokes.  Oh, no, no, that's not what it was.  I'll say it.  The Tonight Show.  They called me, and they said, I'm the only guy to get a standing ovation on The Tonight Show since Jay Leno took over,  but this was, like, a year and a half or two years ago, and they never had me on it. 
[02:31:00]  So they called me the other day, and they said, we'd love to have you on the show, but you can't do any ethnic jokes,  only jokes that are ethnic, like, against you.  You can do any kind of Spanish, you know, jokes that you want, but you can't say black.  You can't do anything at all.  That's sad.  And I swear to you, I knew that day was going to happen, you know what I mean?  And now that day's come where, like, even I can't do jokes about other people now because people are sensitive, you know what I mean?  And here are my feelings.  So they told you not to do it, and you stuck to your dick? 
[02:31:30]  You stuck to your guns and said, uh...  I said, then I won't do it because then it doesn't represent what I do, you know what I mean?  Because I pick on everybody.  I don't care if you're white or you're black.  You know, to me, it doesn't matter because the way I look at it is this.  If you think you're black, watch the Olympics.  Your black ass is American when America needs you.  I ain't never seen an African-American gold medal count in my life, you know what I mean?  All of a sudden, you ain't a nigga no more.  Oh, you're one of us, boy.  Bring your gold medal and put it up.  All we care about is that little medal count. 
[02:32:00]  It doesn't matter who brought it there.  They don't care, you know what I mean?  You're not a lesbian.  You're a member of the softball team.  Bring your medal up here.  We don't care, you know?  We don't care.  Amy Chow, yeah, the closest you've ever come to China is Rites-A-Roni.  Get your ass up here.  You know what I'm saying?  That Italian girl, Mochiano, you know what I mean?  You're not Italian.  Bring your ass up here.  Horses head my ass.  Bring your gold medal up here.  We don't care.  Nobody cares.  You know, when America needs you, nobody cares.  You know, all of a sudden, listen, everyday life, we've got to worry about it. 
[02:32:30]  I've got my feelings sensitive.  I could care less.  If you're easily offended, and I don't mean this, stay your ass away from my show.  Do not even come close to my show.  You know, last time, the time previous before this one, Flight 800 crashed, and the day  after it crashed, I was listening.  And here's how my comedy works.  I stayed up all night watching it.  You know, I cried part of the night just thinking, I can't believe, thinking some bomber did it. 
[02:33:00]  It was like, man, you know, if you want to fight us, bring it on.  You know what I mean?  Don't kill my kid on the way to school and then pretend, I am good water.  You know what I mean?  You're a pussy, dude.  You know, if you want to fight, bring it on.  You know, tell me face to face.  We'll scrap, dude.  You know, and then you kick my ass.  I walk away from it and go, you beat me.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But don't, like, go for, like, the week.  Don't put a bomb in a plane and then pretend, you know what I mean?  Like, you're doing something great.  So, anyway, I was pissed.  And then I heard that the name, one of the pilot's names, this is true, of Flight 800, was Kevorkian. 
[02:33:30]  All right?  Oh, my God.  Exactly, man.  I went on the next day and I said, listen, if I'm on a plane and this guy comes out and  says, I don't know, this is your path and Kevorkian speaking, my ass is running off the plane.  I'm off, dude.  I'm getting the next flight.  I don't care.  Coincidence, family member.  I really don't give a s***.  I am off the plane.  I heard that.  I heard that.  I'm just getting off, man.  There's no way, you know?  Old people are going to be like, why are you getting off?  You know, because I'm not even sick. 
[02:34:00]  I'm running.  I'm sorry, man.  You know what I'm saying?  And I just do not, you know, I don't care.  And then I did that joke and this one dude was like, got up and you're here and you don't  know when people died and died and died.  And he was all, man.  And I'm just like, look, man, it's comedy.  That's what you're here for.  It's a comedy show.  I swear to God, go tonight.  You'll see.  There will be jokes and people will go.  Some people, they're in jokes.  And knowing that they're jokes, go, ooh.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:30]  Now it's not funny anymore.  I can't believe you just said that.  But it's a comedy club.  I don't understand.  You wouldn't go to like a strip joint and go, b***h.  What kind of a stand-ish man is this?  Boobs all over the place.  I swear to God, this is panarchy everywhere.  This is just what it is.  I have a little joy.  This is what it is.  You got to expect you're going to hear some stuff.  You're going to walk in there, right?  You're going to see someone like Carlos Mencia.  But they're just jokes, though. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I know.  Like, I'm a professional.  I mean, this is what I do.  It's not like I'm some guy with a hood coming up going, where are all the niggers at?  I mean, that's different, you know what I'm saying?  All right.  I don't like that guy either.  It's not like I'm dragging people behind pickup trucks either, you know?  I'm just telling jokes here.  But people get offended.  And with me, it's like everybody.  The Latin community is offended at me and some of the black community  because I was doing this joke about how there's a statistic, right? 
[02:35:30]  For every five white guys that do drugs, two blacks or two Hispanics, you know, racialized.  So two Hispanics, five white guys, two blacks, five white guys.  But for every two black or Hispanics in jail, there's one white guy, right?  So my friend was arguing this point with me the other day.  So I went on stage and I'm like, listen, there's a reason for that.  And somebody yells out and goes, that's right, racism.  And some Mexican guy goes, yeah, that's right, racism.  And I said, well, I don't think so.  I think it's because when white people do drugs, they actually do it inside the house. 
[02:36:00]  They're smart enough to realize it's illegal to be doing this thing, man.  You know, they go, hey, Bubba, you want to smoke some?  Hell yeah.  Let's do it inside the house.  Because somebody might see us.  Whereas in our neighborhood, it's like, yo, dog, you want to shoot something off?  You know what?  Let's do it outside, man, on the porch. 
[02:36:30]  What are you doing, man?  You roll by these neighbor, and it's like, you know, if there's more drugs being distributed in the white neighborhoods, that's fine.  But you can drive by any middle-class white neighborhood in any borough that you want, you know what I'm saying?  And you will not see a bunch of people run out of a corner and ask you what you want.  You know what I'm saying?  It's only in the black and white Hispanic neighborhoods.  If you drive somewhere there, all of a sudden, what you want? 
[02:37:00]  Nothing, man.  It's got laws, bro.  Man, it left, shoot them in right.  That's it, you know?  You can drive by a middle-class neighborhood all you want, man.  Nobody's going to run out of the backyard, you know, holding the trunk, whatever, the barbecue thing, talking about how much you want.  It ain't going to happen, and there's a reason for that.  So you do a joke like that, and all of a sudden, you know, you're anti, you're with the white people, and, you know, you're anti-us, and why are you saying stuff like that?  And I'm like, because you should be smart.  If you're going to do something illegal, you dumbass, do it in the house, you know, like The Corner. 
[02:37:30]  Did you guys see the thing called The Corner on HBO?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do movies about how we sell drugs and do them outside.  It's called The Corner, not inside the house, in the bathroom, The Corner, you know?  If that was a white guy doing drugs, it would be called, you know, In the Closet.  It would be called In the Closet.  In the bathroom, yeah.  Right, because their kids would have no idea.  See, when they do drugs about white people, the kids have no clue whatsoever that the white guys do drugs.  It was like, you know, like what was that movie where they brought, they brought, the doctors brought themselves back to life or something like that? 
[02:38:00]  Flatliners.  Flatliners, yeah.  Remember in Flatliners where Julia Roberts, you know, she walks in and her dad's shooting up and he's like, oh, and she's, that would never be it.  That would never be a Latino, you know what I mean?  That wouldn't be it because we wouldn't be hiding, you know what I'm saying?  And then you do some jokes like that that are real and honest and just, they're not even really jokes.  They're just realities that happen to be funny.  Observations.  Right?  And then all of a sudden people get a hair up their ass, you know? 
[02:38:30]  You're the evil sellout.  And, you know, to the white people, I'm the demon.  To the blacks and Hispanics, I'm a sellout.  To the Hindus, you know, I don't even know what the hell I am.  Just going to your shows, Eskimos.  I try to help out, you know?  Like every once in a while I say, Hindus, please come to my show.  I haven't worn, you know, any deodorant for like a week.  So you guys are going to feel at home?  You know, you do something like that.  And then people go, why would you say that?  I'm thinking, I don't know, maybe because when I'm walking down the street and one of them walks by, I go, God damn, what stinks, man? 
[02:39:00]  Who was that?  You know, when a Hasidic Jew looks around and goes, God damn, that was stinky.  That's when you know your ass needs to shower or something, you know what I mean?  Like you've got to adhere to some American rules, you know what I mean?  Speed stick, that's one of our little sticky rules.  You know, there's some things that you should just, you know, do a joke like that and everybody, everybody acts like you pulled it out of your ass, you know?  Yeah, where did it come from?  Like where did it come from?  Got to be based in some kind of reality. 
[02:39:30]  And then I tell people, well, stereotypes are funny.  Oh, stereotypes aren't true.  Oh, really?  We love stereotypes on this show.  But that's because they're true.  Right.  And if you don't believe me, you don't believe me, the stereotypes are true.  If one stereotype is true, all stereotypes are true.  So go up to a black guy and ask him, do you like fried chicken?  He'll be like, man, hell no, man.  That's a stereotype.  All right, I'm just checking.  You like watermelon.  That's another stereotype, man.  All right, I'm just checking.  Is it true that all black men have large penises?  Oh, you know that's true. 
[02:40:00]  Well, if you've got a big penis, you tap dance and love watermelon, too, my brother.  Get some fried chicken to go with that big-ass penis of yours.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, get one or the other, man.  You know, they're either real or not.  Don't pick and choose.  Like, this one's good for me, but these are not.  Come on, man.  I think we're going to get along just fine with Carlos Menzia.  Let's take a break, Carlos.  Let you breathe, okay?  212-757-1027. 
[02:40:30]  We'll be back in just a bit.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, we're hanging with Carlos Menzia.  Yeah.  We were talking about friends and campers and heffing the fat chick for your friend,  all that fun stuff during the break.  Sometimes you've got to take the bullet.  Yeah, you've got to, man.  And the funny part is that you know when that moment happens.  As soon as your friend starts hitting on the cute chick, 
[02:41:00]  you just turn into wingman, you know what I mean?  You just do, man.  He's Maverick, you're Goose.  Get on it, bro.  You know what I'm saying?  And normally, you know, see, the cool thing about L.A.  is that there are certain clubs where the ugly chick is still cool,  you know what I'm saying?  But when I was younger, man, and I used to go hang out like at just a regular schmo,  oh my God, dude.  There were some skinkasauruses, man.  It was sad. 
[02:41:30]  It was like the cute one and then her friend was like,  you know what I'm saying?  It was harsh, man.  I had to, man, it's not even funny things I had to do for my friends.  It is not even cool, dude.  You don't have been there, though, man.  You speak the truth, Carlos.  But you know what you were saying?  The cool part is, is like when friends did it for me, you know,  I still ragged on them after.  You did the fat chick.  There's one moment.  There's like one real moment of like, dude, you're my bro.  You know that.  But right after that, it's like, 
[02:42:00]  I can't believe you did it for that.  It's where you got to, man.  Because, you know, that's ammunition.  You can't let go of it, you know.  You're there, but I did the fat chick to do you a favor  so you could go home with the honey.  And now you're using it against me.  Yeah, but you have to.  Because, you know, your friends, it's there, man.  That's what chicks don't understand.  Like chicks, you know, chicks don't,  chicks are just mean to each other all around, dude.  And chicks always like complain about guys.  That's the thing that gets me.  Like I have 11 sisters.  I know.  Oh, that's true? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  I heard you talking about that on your CD.  Oh, no, I really have 11 sisters and 6 brothers.  It was busting apart those stereotypes.  I told you, brother.  Screw it.  Didn't I say it earlier?  18 kids, bro.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  You have 18 kids in your family?  Well, yeah, 11 sisters and 6 brothers.  And then it's me.  That's 18.  No, I did the math.  Thank you.  Wow.  Well, you said no way.  I know, I know.  I was just shocked.  Why, dude?  18 kids.  Right.  I'm one of seven.  I thought that was a lot.  Well, it is a lot, dude.  Just because I have more doesn't mean yours is not a lot. 
[02:43:00]  18 is a lot.  All right.  Whatever.  No, it is a lot, dude.  I agree.  Here's the cool part.  This is how cool my family is.  Yeah.  This is where I get my humor from.  I was doing a, I was in school one day and we were doing this economics class and we were  studying about social security.  My mom was born in Mexico.  My dad was born in Honduras.  So they had a lot of kids because, you know, where they come from, there's no social security.  So they have a lot of kids open.  We make money eventually taking care of them in the end. 
[02:43:30]  That's pretty much everybody from an old country.  That's, that's their state of mind.  So I go up to my dad and say, we're discussing this dad and blah, blah, blah.  And I need to do a report on it.  So you're kind of the guy that we need to ask because you have so many kids.  And, you know, this was the theory behind what we thought, blah, blah, blah.  So I need to ask you why so many though?  Why 18?  Was it because of what, you know, what was the reason?  And my dad goes, oh, it's not that complicated.  Your mother just doesn't like to suck.  Wait a minute. 
[02:44:00]  I swear to God, dude.  And my jaw drops to the floor, dude.  I swear to God.  So then I go, so then I look at him seriously.  I go, dad, you know, thanks for, thanks for like sharing a moment of like, you know,  I'm trying to be like serious.  I want to get an A in the report.  Yeah, thanks for helping out, you know.  I'm not going to put that in the report.  And then my dad goes, no, now you got to put it in.  If you ask me, you got to put it in.  I'm going to read it.  And if it's not in there, I'm going to rip it up. 
[02:44:30]  You got to put it in.  If you ask me, you got to put it in there.  I'm like, why do you want me to put it in there for?  You're sick, man.  He's sick.  And then he's like, because I want people to know them.  They may be telling her and she changes.  Boy, well, it was like all of a sudden people at school are going to be saying, you know,  Mrs. Mencia doesn't prefer on it.  He's like, that's going to happen, dad.  And then she's going to hear it someday and eventually she's going to change.  Dude, why don't you just ask her, bro? 
[02:45:00]  You know?  God, man.  Dude, I have the funniest.  My family is so cool.  I mean, we're just so funny.  Everything was always funny.  There was never, you know, a moment where, like, when I was four years old, I got caught  in gunfire outside my house.  And it's really funny, right?  The stereotype bell going off like, hey, bro.  It's true, man.  I got caught.  I'm like four years old.  I got caught outside and I couldn't move. 
[02:45:30]  I could hear the bullets.  You can hear bullets, by the way, whiz in the air.  Yeah.  They make like a little, and really, they do.  So I'm there and I'm facing the opposite direction of my house.  I'm about 30 feet from my house.  I slowly roll over and look at my mom and she's like out in the door, but she doesn't  come out because the bullets are flying.  And then anyway, the moment comes to pass and blah, blah, blah.  And then one day, like later on, you know, I was like, mom, I remember that day that I  was out there.  I, you know, I'm not cool with it, but you know, why don't you come out and like save 
[02:46:00]  me, man, and my mom goes, hey, you're one of 18.  You're not special.  Oh, God.  And then she goes, and Manuel looks a lot like you.  So I was like, I'm missing you.  And I look over to my dad like a puppy with like a tear in his eye and he goes, well, why'd  you ask?  Do you know what she's going to say?  Oh, that's awful. 
[02:46:30]  Dude, it's so like, you know what I mean?  My family is, is everything was always, you know, make it funny, man, make it funny.  And the stereotypes, that's, that's to me, like where a lot of this stuff comes from,  you know what I mean?  Where, where the basis of it is stereotype, like here's a stereotype, white people hate  to truly complain, except in New York when, you know, you're, you're Jewish, but like  this normal, everyday average white Americans hate to complain.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  And it's like, I don't know where it came from, but it did. 
[02:47:00]  And, and that's why this whole, this whole election got screwed up because those old  white people, you know what I mean?  Didn't want to complain, even though they knew when they left.  Cause I was there in Miami and I heard an interview on the radio where they asked an  older Jewish guy, who did you vote for?  And he actually said, I don't know.  It was confusing.  I hope I vote for Gore.  God damn.  I swear to God.  Right.  But they didn't complain that day.  And I'm in, and see, I don't understand that because in my culture, you complain. 
[02:47:30]  Black people, man, if there was a ballot in the black part of Dade County that they didn't  understand, there would be a black guy still right now going, hell no, you can't close this,  man.  Leave this to a nigga one more time.  In a bonnet, this is a East side and that's a West side.  Let the brother know what's up, man.  You know, but the white people, it's like, we're going to send a fax and email our dissatisfaction  to the service. 
[02:48:00]  You know, and like these old people, you know, we couldn't understand the ballot.  Yeah.  But when you go play bingo, your ass has 20 cards and you keep track of every single one.  Oh, and it's bingo time.  He can see us through his ass.  You know what I mean?  All of a sudden it's voting time two times.  Retard.  So anyway, that foundation, right, of that comes from this.  I'm with my friends at this place called Jack in the Box, which I don't think you guys have  on here.  You used to have the Jack in the Box. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, you got Jack in the Box.  Do we still have them on here?  I think there's one or two left.  All right, so Jack in the Box, we're right through Jack in the Box and four of us, we order  whatever, burgers and the fries.  We're about two minutes away from the drive-thru.  I go, hey, where's my fries?  My wife's going to, oh, dude, they forgot them.  Don't worry about it.  Just have some of our fries.  I'm like, dude, no, I want my fries.  I want your fries.  I paid for fries.  I want my fries.  Let's go back and get my fries.  Oh, dude, we're not going to go back, dude.  Whatever.  Dude, just, you can have some of our fries. 
[02:49:00]  And I'm like, listen, a-hole, I want my fries.  I want your fries.  See, I paid for my fries.  So then my wife's like, all right, you know what?  They forgot my fries.  No, we already established they were my fries.  They forgot.  You can't go back and pretend they're yours.  I want my fries.  And so anyway, like, anyway, I got pissed.  They didn't go back.  And I realized that for me, it was the opposite extreme.  When I was a kid, we used to go to Kentucky Fried Chicken once a month or two months, whatever.  It was like our big family outing. 
[02:49:30]  And we would drive 20 minutes to go get food for 20 people, right?  Now, nobody liked macaroni and cheese except for my dad.  So he would order the little small thing, the macaroni and cheese.  I remember one time, drove there, got our food, went back, put everything on the table.  Pati and my dad goes, hold up.  Where's the macaroni and cheese?  And my mom goes, ay, mijo, I think they forgot it.  Put everything back in the bathroom.  But right now, we want to go back for the macaroni and cheese.  I swear to God, dude, he made us put the whole bucket, the whole thing, the whole thing for a little macaroni and cheese, dude. 
[02:50:00]  And we're in the car looking at each other like, dude, our dad is a stone-cold wet-back immigrant.  This is not even cool, man.  We speak English, bro.  I got to go to school with some of the people that work at this place.  Unbelievable.  And my dad goes in, like, throws the thing and goes, where's the macaroni and cheese?  That's the first words out of his mouth.  And people looking at him funny, like, don't, you got a camera. 
[02:50:30]  Go look at his camera.  I paid for the macaroni and cheese.  I throw 20 minutes, and now you got to give me more chicken.  You got to give me more chicken because you forgot to give me more chicken.  Dude, and we're in the back going, oh, man, our dad is, oh, my God.  And, you know, he fulfilled that stereotype.  Like, no problem with that, that's who he was, man.  And part of that is me, too.  I just don't go that far with it.  You know what I mean?  That's funny.  There's so much.  God damn.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, if you want to play stereotypes, the reason why us white folks don't complain is because we're too busy working. 
[02:51:00]  That's funny.  But actually, you know what?  You guys don't, the stereotype, like, you guys don't work as hard as, like, immigrants.  Because immigrants, I mean, believe it or not, you can say white people work hard, but wherever you go in America, it doesn't matter now.  It really, like, there used to be a day, and people who travel will tell you, there used to be a day when you traveled, you would probably, like, kind of know where you were going.  You know, if you were going to Miami, New York, or L.A., it would be ethnic, you know, Chicago. 
[02:51:30]  But if you were going, like, Birmingham, Alabama, it's pretty much white people.  Today, you can catch a flight to Birmingham, Alabama, and it looks like you're going to New York.  You know what I mean?  There's no, like, that thing is gone, man.  There's ethnicities are just everywhere.  And you don't realize it until, like, you know, Birmingham is probably the whitest city in the world, the most denoted racist city in the world.  But at 9 o'clock in the morning, bro, at my hotel, she was there, dude. 
[02:52:00]  I don't know how she got there, bro.  I was talking to her, and she couldn't even say Birmingham.  I was like, you can't even say Birmingham.  She was just like, yeah, Birmingham.  I said, it was the funniest thing, man, and you know what I mean?  So, they were clearly hard.  But, see, I like the fact that the guy had the balls to call in and do that.  So, that's cool, man.  See, it's funny.  We encourage that.  We encourage that on our show.  Dude, I love when people acknowledge that it's cool enough to tell jokes about each other.  Yeah, we like to think that.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Unfortunately, some people can't take a joke.  Well, yeah, but here's the thing.  Not that it affects us.  We don't care.  Well, but here's the thing.  Here's, like, this is the way I break it down, very simplistically.  If somebody were to drop a bomb, let's just name a country.  Let's just name Russia.  Or China.  Let's name China.  If China tomorrow were to drop a bomb in Denver, all right, is there anybody in the city of New York,  whatever ethnicity you are, that will not be willing to go to war against China?  No.  So, you're willing to die for each other, basically.  Everybody out there that's willing to fight for America is willing to preserve my right. 
[02:53:00]  Carlos Quincy is right, as an American, to do and say whatever is constitutionally upheld.  So, if you're willing to die for me, don't you think it would be nice if I let you tell a joke about my ass?  Do you know what I'm saying?  I mean, it's just, like, that simple.  I'm willing to die for you?  Tell a joke.  It's that simple for me.  So, if everybody gets their hair up their ass, I really don't care.  Because when push comes to shove, I'm there for you, dude.  We're family.  And so, the reason why I do stereotypes is because they're not a big deal. 
[02:53:30]  Now, if Mexico goes to war.  Oh, dude, I'll kill Mexicans.  In a heartbeat, bro.  Because I ain't a real Mexican, bro.  I mean, I'm only, like, you can call me a Mexican if you want, just so you know that I live in L.A.  A Mexican-American.  Well, I'm not even a Mexican-American.  I wish I was half and then I only pay half my taxes, but that doesn't work out that way.  I'm a Mexican-American and then on April 15th, you're all American.  You know what I mean?  I don't give you that half rebate for the other half, you know, which I've totally been asking for, but they don't hook me up with that. 
[02:54:00]  No, I mean, you know, I don't like that term, African-American.  You know, anybody who thinks they're African-American, I mean, unless you came from Africa, and even if you did, you left there because it sucked.  So, right there, you're not African anymore.  But, like, people that grew up here, like, I'm African-American.  No, you're not, dude.  And I'm not Mexican, and I speak Spanish fluently, and I'm telling you I'm not a real Mexican.  I will buy any black person that grew up here, all right, African-American, a ticket to Rwanda.  When you get off the plane and they look at your black ass and go, what, are you going to get a flashback? 
[02:54:30]  What, are you going to remember?  That ain't going to happen, bro.  You're going to be like, he's sorry.  That's what you're going to be like.  You know what I'm saying?  The Bronx is in the house.  I mean, just to be honest, you know what I mean?  Nobody wants to, like, admit, like, everybody wants to hate America now.  Everybody, you know what I mean?  Nobody wants to love it.  Black people want to hate it and the Bronx want to hate it.  White people want to, like, they changed it too much.  They changed it too much, you know?  Like, if you look at the voting patterns of America, it's like everybody who voted for Gore, the little blue specks, 
[02:55:00]  were, like, all surrounding the coastline, right?  Yeah.  Because everybody, all the white people are, like, moving to the middle.  You know what I mean?  And they think that that's a smart thing to do, but then every year they come out and get hit by tornadoes.  And they say, well, we need help.  We got hit by tornadoes again.  And these are the people that say, you know, black people don't even know how to spoke it right. 
[02:55:30]  You know, if I'm not mistaken, there is no R at the end of tornado, bubba.  You know what I'm saying?  What did that happen?  You see, like, that stuff.  Everybody screws up English.  You know what I mean?  Like, people that pick on black people for ebonics.  Everybody does it.  Hispanics do it.  You know what I mean?  We make up words that aren't English or Spanish.  You know what I mean?  Like, we'll take the word push and take the word empujar, right?  And make puchar. 
[02:56:00]  You know, and only if you live here do you understand what that means.  But you think, you know, that's where we get bad grades in Spanish.  Because we think, oh, I know Spanish.  And then we take it in high school.  A D?  How did I get a D?  You know what I mean?  And then your parents are like, how can you get a D?  And you're like, because you told me puchar was a word.  It's your fault.  Not my fault.  You know what I mean?  You're pissed, you know.  And all of a sudden, they're the ones that taught you the heritage.  And they taught it to you screwed up.  And you're the retard.  You know what I mean?  Everybody screws up.  Asians have the highest GPA in America. 
[02:56:30]  But you go to one of their liquor stores, and you still have to buy a lottery ticket.  Dude, what did you get in English?  Oh, in English, it's rush.  It's right.  Can I get a lottery ticket?  Oh, are you fearing Rucky?  Whatever that is.  Rucky?  I mean, you know, you're such funny, man.  Everybody screws up English.  Charlie, you want in on this or what?  I own a landscaping business.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:57:00]  That's great.  Hey, here's the story about my dad.  Here's the story about my dad, speaking of landscaping.  It was about, there's a place called Builders in Portland.  Went out of business.  Used to be the Home Depot where I grew up.  My father, at the time this happened, had a driver's license for a semi-truck.  Had a license to fly as a pilot.  And was an engineer and a contractor.  All right?  By the time this happened.  We're there.  And he's still, my dad's one of those guys that has an accent.  But he speaks eloquently with an accent. 
[02:57:30]  You know what I mean?  He's one of those guys that goes like this boy.  You know, he brings out the big words, you know, because you have to be eloquent.  You know what I mean?  If you're not going to say, man, the people don't know what to look at you.  You know, that's the kind of guy you.  So anyway.  Like Al Pacino from Cigar Face.  Yeah, something like that.  So he goes in there.  We're walking in there.  And there used to be like immigrants that, you know, stayed outside to get work, basically.  So we're walking in, me and my dad.  And I'm like, I don't know, eight, nine years old.  And a white guy drives up in a pickup truck. 
[02:58:00]  And he goes, hey, senor.  A pinto de helso.  Mucho pinto helso.  Right?  And my dad, I thought my dad was going to get pissed, right?  My father looks at him and he goes, how many people do you need?  And he goes, six people, five dollars an hour.  My father goes, where am I going?  Don't go.  He walks over to where the illegal aliens are.  And in Spanish says to him, I need six people, five dollars an hour.  Get in the truck.  I pay you right now.  And six dudes ran. 
[02:58:30]  So he gave him, you know, five bucks.  He put them on the truck.  Walked up to the guy.  There they go.  You know, and the guy was like, the guy had said, I'll give you 50 bucks to my dad.  So then my dad goes, okay, they're right there.  Give me the 50 dollars.  The guy gave him the 50 bucks and he left, right?  And I was like, dad, how come you didn't get mad?  And he goes, because I was the middle man.  He didn't know how to get to the people.  I was the broker.  I took my percentage.  Now we have 20 more dollars.  That's how you look, baby.  You know what I mean?  And I was just like, wow, man.  He didn't get mad.  He took 20 bucks from this. 
[02:59:00]  That was great, dude.  You know what I'm saying?  And so it applied to me.  One time I was at a mall.  This is a true story.  I'm walking out of a mall.  This guy comes up to me and he goes, hey.  And in a matter of fact way, by the way, he wasn't even, he was like the nicest guy.  He goes, hey, I lock my keys in my car.  You're Mexican.  You can get them out.  We can't shoot.  And I wanted to get picked, but I knew how to do it.  So I was kind of stuck.  Do I pretend that I don't know how to do it or do I just kind of go, well, you got the 
[02:59:30]  right beaner.  Reward him for his accuracy on picking the right one.  So I walk up to his car and I go, is this your car?  And he goes, yep.  And I broke his window.  And I go, well, there you go.  Get your keys.  And the guy goes, how come you broke my window?  And I go, because I don't have a Slim Jim.  Get in your car.  How we do it.  And I go, that's how we do it, bro.  I go, you better get in your car before I steal your stereo because my instincts are 
[03:00:00]  starting to shake in, bro.  And I really did break his window.  And the guy was pissed off.  And I go, no, dude, I saved you money.  And he's like, I don't get it.  I go, listen, if you would have called the tow truck, he would have charged you 50 bucks,  right, to open your door.  Around the corner, there's a guy named Manuel.  He works at this place called Instinctry Glass.  Tell him Carlos sent you for 35 bucks.  He'll clean it and vacuum it.  And you save $15.  And the guy was like, really?  And he went over there and he saved him the money.  But I really did break his window.  But it was like my dad. 
[03:00:30]  I could have taken his 50 bucks, you know what I mean?  And then made the 15 and whatever.  I don't want to do that.  But I mean, for me, it's just like, it's that simple, man.  You know, people want to get it out and be funny.  That's cool, man.  You know, I have a contracting business.  That's funny.  Because those are people you want to hire.  Dude, if I had a contracting business, I would never hire an American.  Ever.  Ever.  People that grew up here, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  You can't tell them to go up on a roof when it's windy.  You know what I'm saying?  Could you imagine telling some Italian guy who grew up in Brooklyn, you know, go up on a  Hey, listen, I'll go up. 
[03:01:00]  But if I fall, I want you to know that it's against the regulation section 2 of the court  of the people that I work for.  So if I fall, you're going to pay.  That's all I'm saying.  And then these are the type of people that will jump and break their ass because it's  your fault.  You know what I'm saying?  The wind died down here.  I don't know.  But I fell because of the wind.  You stole me.  Now you owe me.  You know what I'm saying?  That's not what I want.  I want some dude who just got here from Nicaragua and go up on the roof.  But he's windy.  Well, I'm going to call immigration and ask him how windy it is.  Oh, man.  He's not that windy. 
[03:01:30]  He's not that windy.  You didn't let me finish.  I was going to say, it's windy.  I need a rope.  That's what I was going to say.  To tie myself to the chimney so I don't fall.  But no, you got to have it on speed dial.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow.  It's funny, man.  You go with it.  It's cool.  Yeah, let's go to the phones here.  Anthony, what's going on?  Oh, ONA, what's up, man?  Carlos, you are killing me, my man.  You are the best.  Reality comedy.  Thanks, man.  There's not enough of that around, right, Anthony? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, this guy is the best.  I was going to say Tony, but, you know, I don't want to feel like a Momo.  There he is.  A Momo.  There he is.  Quick, quick, quick story.  Quick story.  Yeah.  I'm at the local, you know, Italian deli.  There's this little old lady in there buying stuff, so I can't really do a Jewish lady's  voice.  She goes, excuse me, do you know the difference between Pecorino and Locatelli?  I was like, what, you assuming I'm Italian?  So, like, the Mexican guy knew the difference more than I did. 
[03:02:30]  He goes, well, that one's a little sharper, and that one's weak.  I was like, that one's a little sharper?  Carlos, you're the man, dude.  Don't need a show, my man.  All right, man.  Later.  I'm going to leave a sharper.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, look, the CD, the name of my CD, by the way, is called Take a Joke America.  It's on Warner Brothers Records.  It should be out at your record stores everywhere.  And if not, you could go to carlosmencia.com. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that's it.  I was about to give you my email address.  That would be smart.  I was like, isn't that at something?  No, that's not it.  Yeah, carlosmencia.com.  Check it out.  There's some cool stuff, man.  This has been a lot of fun.  You've got to come back.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, dude, this is the perfect show for you.  I'm telling you, Carlos.  This is it right here.  Oh, bro, man.  You do a lot of radio around the country?  I do so much radio, it hurts.  Here's what happens.  They say, do whatever you want.  And then, you know what, I'll go up on stage.  That's exactly what we told them today, though.  And I'll go up on stage and, like, say the word nigga. 
[03:03:30]  You know what I mean?  And all of a sudden, you can just hear, like, the room just go, just quiet.  You know what I mean?  I'm just like, you know, black people are going to get mad.  You can't say that word.  You know?  Because people have told me, you can't, you can't.  I had a black guy one time tell me that.  You can't say the word nigga.  I said, well, I'll stop saying nigga when my black friends stop calling me one.  What's that?  You know, I thought I was a spick.  I hang out with my black friends.  What's up, nigga?  Oh, that too. 
[03:04:00]  Damn!  Can I be more minority?  Gee, call me a chink and I'm leaving.  I'm killing myself.  I'll never get a job.  But you know what I mean?  How, like, retarded is that?  If somebody calls me, you know, what's up, nigga?  I'm going to respond.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's like, how stupid are people that now, like, when you listen to radios, especially  like hip-hop stations, they bleep out the word nigga as if the guy's trying to say nigger,  which are two completely different words.  Everybody knows that.  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Nigga, nigger.  Nigga, you're my boy.  You're my dog.  You're cool.  Nigga, you either want to get your ass beat or you got backup.  One or the other.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  Man, that's just one or the other, bro.  That, you know, and there are people out in America that want to pretend like they don't  know the difference.  You know, and that's the kind of stuff that kills me where you go to, like, the Midwest.  See, that's the problem.  How come you can say nigger and black people say nigger, but when I'm calling nigger a nigger, 
[03:05:00]  I'm an Idaho.  Because you're retarded.  You get hit by a tornado every year and you don't move.  Isn't that cool?  You live in Tornado Alley, for Christ's sake.  It's not even that difficult for you to move.  Your house has wheels, you dumbass.  Drive away, retard.  Anyway.  With that, we're going to let you go.  It's Carlos Mencia.  Yeah, thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  Our, our, our, our, by O.P. and Anthony, all, all, owned by Infinity Broadcasting.
