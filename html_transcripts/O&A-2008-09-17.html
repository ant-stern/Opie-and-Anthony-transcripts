<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, referencing "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" and promoting their website, ONARadio.com. Anthony received praise for his accurate stock market prediction.  The conversation then turned to the upcoming election,  Congressman Charles Rangel's alleged tax evasion, and Opie's childhood anecdotes involving tax avoidance and various jobs, hinting at a privileged upbringing despite financial struggles.  The Mets' poor performance and tendency to "choke" were discussed, followed by the introduction of a new intern, David, responsible for a "kosher sports" segment.  The partisan nature of modern politics and the difficulty of bipartisan cooperation were also debated.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a news story about three elderly Boston women protesting the removal of a crabapple tree by tying themselves to it.  The hosts reacted with mockery and crude humor, offering $500 for the tree's removal and using the women's profanity-laced comments ("can't") from a news report as a running joke.  Offensive jokes targeting the women's appearances and personal lives were made.  Other news items covered included Derek Jeter's baseball record, Tony Kornheiser's apology for a joke about Spanish-language sports commentary, and Governor David Paterson's appearance and shaving habits.  The hosts frequently injected offensive jokes related to race, ethnicity, and sexuality, and made light of their own forced apologies.

The failed attempt to interview the three elderly women ("Ethel" and two others) regarding the crabapple tree resulted in hilariously awkward audio, deemed "radio gold" by the hosts, who replayed snippets repeatedly.  Other topics included singer Kat DeLuna messing up the national anthem, a video of skateboarders going 60 mph, declining physical music sales, and Coldplay's overplayed songs.  An extended discussion about intern David followed, covering his dating attempts, his father driving him, and teasing about his interview notes.  The "Kosher Sports" segment with David explored his Jewish background, leading to numerous "Ask the Jew" questions from callers and the hosts about yarmulkes, mezuzahs, Jewish customs, and even Jewish serial killers.  An email exchange between David and a show employee about his internship interview was read, revealing David's initial uncertainty about the interviewers' identities.

A listener, David, answered three listener questions about Jewish religious items (tzitzis, a kippah, and a sheet).  The hosts discussed the significance of these items, often humorously misinterpreting them.  The monetary value of bar mitzvah gifts was also debated. The Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, crabapple tree protesters were discussed again, playing audio of Ethel, whose accent and statement ("there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree") became comedic material.  A video of "Earth First" members crying over dead trees led to a humorous philosophical discussion about tree and animal spirits.  A photo of the world's shortest man and the woman with the world's longest legs prompted crude jokes.  The segment then featured a bit about athletes in bad commercials (Carson Palmer, Kobe Bryant, John Elway).  A prank involving revealing pornographic actress Lisa Sparks to David resulted in a stilted, humorous interview.  Further off-color banter followed, including jokes about Sarah Palin and flatulence.

A female guest, Lisa, whose breasts were repeatedly commented on and touched by David under the hosts' encouragement, sparked a near-physical altercation when Lisa's husband (later revealed to be a listener acting in a staged prank) burst into the studio enraged.  Apologies followed, along with discussions of the staged event, and praise for the husband's acting (Carlton).  Final comments focused on Lisa and her website.

The final segment featured Lisa Sparks, a pornographic actress, discussing her sexual preferences and experiences in graphic detail, including a bukkake scene.  The hosts and Lisa discussed safety measures and her career, including her claimed record for gangbang participants.  David, new to the porn industry, joined and his reactions to Lisa's stories provided humor.  Chaotic events outside the studio, involving Derek and "Hoagie Boy" complaining about a sandwich, disrupted the show, leading to Derek being brought into the studio.  The discussion returned to Lisa and David, analyzing a picture from Lisa's website depicting a group sex scene, focusing on graphic details and Lisa's facial expression. The segment concluded with continued sexually explicit discussion, speculation about what David would tell his parents, playful banter, and a discussion of various sexual acts. The show ended with sponsor promotion, the "Line of the Day" segment, and jokes about David and his future appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everybody.  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes.  Here in New York City.  Nothing but boobies to be seen today, right?  Right?  Breast-a-sus.  Breast-a-sus.  Breast-a-sus-sus-sus.  Breast-a-sus.  Phone number 877-212-0ADAY.  We get that out there. 
[00:00:30]  We got the ONARadio.com.  A lot of attention to ONARadio.com.  Because, yeah, we post all the visual stuff up there.  Yup.  And it makes your listening experience that much better.  Your listening pleasure.  I want to give props to Anthony right off the bat.  Propellers.  I love propellers.  The more the better.  One of my favorite things to do is to beat you up.  Yeah.  But I also have to acknowledge when you do good. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you do good every day.  Aww.  But you called this Dow Jones thing, my friend.  Yes.  You called the, what was it?  The dead cat bounce.  The dead cat bounce.  See, I said everything got dragged down the other day with the 504 point loss with the  financials taking a crap.  So everything else gets dragged down and then people go, hey, wait a minute.  You know, this has nothing to do with the crisis and the financials, but it's a nice  low price, so I should buy it. 
[00:01:30]  And then a lot of people seem to do that, so the market went up.  The panic brought the whole market down and then there's people that are smart enough out  there going, whoa, there's some opportunities here, my friend.  But shouldn't we be worried today?  Today is a little iffy.  Today it should go back down, right?  I think you're going to see a finish probably either way, but not too high or low either  way.  Mm-hmm.  That's what I think.  Now watch, it's going to be a 600 point flow out. 
[00:02:00]  One way or the other.  What do I know?  I was thinking about the show yesterday, a lot of intelligent talk on this Opie and  Anthony show lately.  Oh, my God.  A lot of like stock talk.  It's like Hannity.  A lot of political talk, intelligent political talk.  But we need to spice it up.  We need to be doing this with naked broads around.  With some nudes.  We need some nudes.  I think we're confusing people out there.  They're like, whoa, this show, they're kind of intelligent.  It's just, well, I doubt people would mistake that too long.  No, I said kind of. 
[00:02:30]  That's why I added the word kind of, because then we bring it right back into the gutter.  I think it's just because, yeah, the election thing, you know, once that's over, back to  pure and total jokes about genitalia, retarded people, AIDS, ethnic diversity.  Oh, yeah.  I was just thinking, does Joe Truck Driver care about the election?  Is he on the phone?  That was my thought yesterday when I was walking around Manhattan. 
[00:03:00]  See, a lot of truck drivers coming in and out of Manhattan.  Yeah.  Do they care about the election in general?  I think so.  I think everybody's pretty concerned because of things like that.  This election year, a lot of things seem to concern a lot of people.  A lot of times the election comes about and people are like, eh, you know, things are going  good or there's nothing really affecting me.  Right now, things are affecting a lot of people. 
[00:03:30]  The price of gas is paramount with people.  Taxes.  This housing crisis.  People that can't pay their mortgages.  Things like that, you know?  So I think people are pretty interested.  Not in a long-winded four-hour diatribe on the election, but I think a little here and  there is fine.  Yeah, very good.  By the way, I'm just asking for Charles Rangel to step down.  Well, you got to explain who Charles Rangel is. 
[00:04:00]  Charles Rangel is a bud-inski in New York.  He's a bud-inski.  He's a slob of a man, too.  Ugh.  Because there's one picture they're showing of him on vacation just passed out or sleeping  in a beach chair.  In a beach chair with his giant guts.  With his giant guts that's kind of falling to the side.  He looks like Sharpton.  Yeah, he's got a little Sharpton in him.  He's got a lot of Sharpton in him, apparently.  Yeah.  What is he, though?  He's a Democratic.  What is he?  The friggin'- 
[00:04:30]  He's a congressman and he represents the district up in Harlem, but he is also chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee, which means he controls the money.  The money!  So-  Linger, wow.  Yeah, so apparently, he doesn't feel compelled to pay his taxes.  Hasn't paid in a few years, right?  A few things have come up where he buys these properties.  He lists the value at a fraction of what they really are valued at. 
[00:05:00]  He sells these properties for a profit and doesn't report the income.  No capital gains?  No!  Why should he?  If he had an-  And then this Pelosi, that piece of crap speaker of the House, Pelosi, is saying there's no reason  he should step down, if there was an R in front of his name, uh, well, there is Wrangel.  Ah, ha, ha!  I meant Republican.  They'd be, uh, looking to chop his head off. 
[00:05:30]  Uh, this guy is, he's, he's, uh, apparently at this point, allegedly, uh, it's a crime  not to pay your taxes.  Believe me, if it was an option, ho-ho, I'd have saved a lot of money a couple of days ago.  But, um, this guy's not paying his taxes!  Step up, step down!  You gotta open up a church.  Yeah?  Yeah, then you don't have to pay your taxes.  Then you don't have to pay your taxes.  Yeah, people do that, too.  Yeah, I was-  And then-  I was part of a church growing up.  And my dad was, you know, the main guy. 
[00:06:00]  He didn't want to, uh-  He never, like, uh, did any sermons or anything, but-  Pesky taxes.  But, you know, I didn't have to pay any sales tax on anything growing up.  Oh, God.  Kind of embarrassing to carry around that tax-exempt form.  You carried it around.  That's right, you carried it around.  Sorry, I'm going off on a-  And when you go into his store, you would show them this form, and then you wouldn't  pay sales tax?  Yeah.  How many times is the store going to go, pay?  Look, if they want to look into my dealings as-  What do you mean you don't pay sales tax? 
[00:06:30]  If they want to look into my-  You're gonna pay sales tax.  If they want to look into-  All right, I'll pay the goddamn sales tax.  If they want to look into my dealings as a 12-year-old, you'll see that I have a clean  record, because I, uh, I may believe that I was using this tax-exempt form.  Because as a 12-, 13-year-old, when you're hanging out with your friends, nothing is more embarrassing  than pulling out a tax-exempt form to buy a pair of sneakers or baseball cards.  Oh, that is embarrassing.  I guess.  I guess we were poor.  I look at the house I was brought up in.  It doesn't look like a poor house. 
[00:07:00]  No, it doesn't.  It's like six, seven rooms.  And it's in a very nice neighborhood.  It's in a nice neighborhood.  But for some reason, we had to live, live like, uh, like poor people.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Huh?  Yeah.  And they were bringing kids in.  There was no money coming in.  So the kids were, the kids were like, we, we, we had to work and bring the money into  the household for groceries and, and to pay the bills.  And now I got two herniated discs from carrying effing golf bags as a 12-year-old. 
[00:07:30]  Do you know Centerport is really considered kind of a hoity-toity neighborhood on Long  Island?  Yeah, no kidding.  It's right on the water.  It's, you know, it's a beautiful little, little township.  It's a little clamming community.  Yeah.  Clamming.  And we had a huge house and no money coming in.  And you were taking your lunch to, to a school in a cement bag.  Yes, that is true.  In a dusty old cement bag.  My, my mom would get the bruised apples because they were cheaper. 
[00:08:00]  Did she go to Machinasian's egg farm and get the cracked eggs?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My friend's mother would do that.  She'd go right to this Machinasian's egg farm where, like, I think everybody growing up around  that area worked there at one point or another.  Yeah.  And Machinasian was just this old, filthy guy.  And, and the first thing you'd have to do is go, you got to take care of the sick chickens.  So you'd go in and have to grab them by the neck and do that whip thing where you'd snap 
[00:08:30]  the sick chicken's neck and throw them in a pile of dead chickens.  So my friend's mom was, was like, I always go to Machinasian's and get the cracked eggs.  Oh, they were cheaper.  They were cheaper.  And the shell was cracked.  They're just as good.  Are they really?  Salmonella.  I couldn't even imagine the salmonella that must have been running around that jernt.  Yeah.  Just waiting to escape and go seep into one of those cracked eggshells.  The shells are there for a reason.  Yeah.  To protect the innards.  But all those stories I told, but I, I, so going back to Rangel and not paying your 
[00:09:00]  taxes.  Yeah.  I'm just saying this is a way that you, you, you, you, a way of not paying your taxes.  Yeah.  You open up a church back in the day.  Well, apparently he doesn't have a church.  Uh, he just decided there was certain income he didn't want to, uh, allegedly, uh, from  what they're seeing in these initial, uh, reports and investigations, it just seems like  he, there are certain income that is highly taxable capital gains income that, uh, he decided  he wasn't going to report. 
[00:09:30]  And why the hell should this guy, uh, not step down because of this?  Wait, wait, wait.  We also forgot he had four rent controlled apartments in a building in his district for  that people were on a waiting list to get people who needed the assistance were on a  waiting list to get an apartment.  And he had four of them.  Wasn't he calling in his office?  Well, one of them was his office.  And he wasn't reporting income for, uh, collecting rent.  Yeah.  This is.  So what's going to happen to this guy? 
[00:10:00]  Let's call being a crook.  Well, what's going to happen to him?  Oh, he'll probably skate.  Nothing.  Cause he's a war hero too.  He'll play the war hero crowd.  How does that matter?  How does that matter?  It doesn't, but he'll play it.  I'm a war hero.  I forgot.  People could just say, people could just forget to pay their taxes and they go, oh, it's  okay.  He did say the one reason he didn't pay taxes on the Dominican Republic rental property  is because he didn't speak Spanish.  Yeah.  And he didn't understand what the paper said.  You know, it doesn't matter what language you speak. 
[00:10:30]  If you're making money doing something in this country, especially if you're a congressman,  I think you should know, you have to pay taxes on it.  Yeah.  Whether you want to or not is a different story, but you know, there's laws in place.  Well, there's character.  He writes the law.  Yeah.  And he writes them.  He's in the tax law business.  What a dummy.  Get out.  That's wonderful.  So we got that going on here in New York City.  And we also have the Mets just. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, this team.  Just the big choke is on.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, I, I, I, as a goof, I'm like, remember last year, it's not going to happen this year.  They lost to the awful minor league team.  The Washington Nationals.  Minor leagues.  They brought the whole team up from the minors.  Well, they wanted Washington to have a, like a baseball team.  So they, they just, I, I guess they brought up like what? 
[00:11:30]  A double A team.  I said, all right, you guys can play majors.  What the hell?  Well, we'll, we'll, we'll give some of these major league teams an easy, an easy game here  and there.  Let the kids play.  That's right.  Let the kids play.  That's the Nationals.  That's right.  So I'm not going to acknowledge because I know the dummies out there are going, you  know, actually they're, they're in the mix.  Shut up.  It's my bit.  I don't want to acknowledge that the Washington Nationals are actually part of the majors.  They're, they're double A ball at best.  And the, and the Mets lost to them one, nothing. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And now the Phillies are in first place.  It was only yesterday that the Mets had like a three.  Three game cushion.  How did they lose three games in one game?  It's amazing.  Because when a double A team wins, you know, you, you officially lose three games.  Three games.  Yeah.  Those are the rules.  It's a little known rule in the major league handbook.  Do you think someone's going to go, but they really are a major league team?  Yeah, of course they will, Jimmy.  They psyched.  They listen to every stupid word of this radio show.  The Mets psyched themselves out. 
[00:12:30]  I think, I think it gets to this time of year and they go like, oh my God, we can't blow  it.  And the second you say that you blow it.  That's the key to life right there.  It's so hard to go like, cause everything I noticed, everything I do where you're doing  well and a game or whatever it is, or some type of competition.  And you say, all right, I'm almost there.  Just don't blow it.  Now you completely blow it.  Think of video games.  Think of anything you do in life.  You're so right. 
[00:13:00]  As soon as you put, put that thought in your head, don't blow it.  It's over.  I'm playing Tiger Woods.  I got a, I got like a seven stroke league.  I'm like, all right, all I have to do is, all I have to do is keep hitting the, uh, the  drive, uh, you know, straight.  That's all I have to do.  Next thing you know, I'm duck hooking into the swabs that I'm going down the leaderboard  and all of a sudden I'm like in 20.  Oh no, I'm blowing it.  I said not to, but I'm blowing it.  And it's just the acknowledgement of, of saying to yourself, don't blow it makes you blow 
[00:13:30]  it.  What is, what is that about?  It's so weird.  You just psych yourself out and, and you screw up.  It's like knob block when you're throwing the ball into the stands.  Oh God.  Remember that stiffen up your body?  Just doesn't do it.  It's supposed to.  Yeah.  You just get a tick or something like he had a cuff, a couple of, you know, bad throws  and then it just got in his head where it's like, don't blow this throw.  Just got to throw to first.  The best way to look at it is, uh, through video gaming.  I'm sure you've, you've done it with some of your video gaming over the years.  Oh yeah.  Where you're like, all right, I got it. 
[00:14:00]  At this level, this is easy.  I've been through it 10 times.  No problem.  Here comes the boss.  Now don't, don't blow it.  I know exactly what I need to do.  Don't blow it.  Oh, I'm dead.  Oh, what happened?  So that's, uh, the Mets choking once again.  Uh, Phillies are half game up and then you gotta, you gotta give it to, uh, well, uh, uh,  yeah, the Red Sox are still in first place.  That's right.  But the Rays beat them last night.  Uh, what was the score of the, the Sox game? 
[00:14:30]  2-1.  2-1.  2-1.  So we'll have to, uh, wait and see.  And I don't even know why I'm doing sports because we got kosher sports today, Anthony.  Oh my God.  What am I doing?  Oy vey.  What are you doing?  When do you want to do kosher sports today?  With David?  Uh, David.  That's all Anthony was doing in the office today.  You'd all be dead now if it wasn't my David.  David.  David.  David.  David.  I love that.  Well, our new intern is, uh, David.  He's a star?  He really is. 
[00:15:00]  A star is born, my David.  And he does kosher sports.  Kosher sports.  He, uh, it's sports with a little Hebrew twist to it.  Just a little.  Just a tad.  Just a, a little, uh, uh, a schmutz of, uh, of Jewish to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a, oh boy.  But I got to tell you, I don't, I don't think he is a weirdo.  Nice enough kid.  He's not as weird as I first thought. 
[00:15:30]  He's not?  Nope.  What?  He's definitely weird.  I think he is a little odd.  I knew kids like him in school.  We all did.  Like, there's somebody like him.  In every school.  In every school.  They do very well.  But they're very, like, opinionated.  And, um, a little weird to hang out with.  Dylan and Eric.  Two kids like him.  Hey, uh, Anthony.  The guy hung up.  And, uh, you know, uh, he wanted to tell you if Charlie Rangel was a Republican, you wouldn't be bringing this up. 
[00:16:00]  Of course I'd be bringing this up.  I'm pointing out crooks.  Can we at least agree that this political thing is a dirty game these people play?  That they play on both sides?  It's so partisan now.  It's worse than it's ever been.  And I thought it was bad during the Clinton administration.  It's, it's only gotten worse.  They cannot work together.  It's, it's impossible for the two parties to work together.  When you have a Republican president and a Democratic, uh, uh, Congress, it's, nothing gets done. 
[00:16:30]  You're either getting vetoes or this one's shooting it down.  It's just, nothing gets done.  And until that, uh, changes, wow, we're screwed.  All right.  Oof.  Let's do our first break.  We're just getting warmed up.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes, that's the important thing.  Bre-s-s-s-s-s.  That's right, women.  We'll explain, uh, the whole Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing for the boobage.  The newbies.  It's 877-212-ON-A if you want to get a hold of us.  And, uh, and that's it. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, Boston is killing us.  Problem?  I made a mistake.  Oh, no.  Well, it's true.  The Rays beat the Red Sox last night.  Yeah.  2-1.  Now the Rays are in first place.  I'm sorry.  I read that wrong.  Yeah.  The Rays have a one-game lead on the Red Sox.  We gotta sound informed with this radio show if we're gonna be broadcasting to Boston. 
[00:17:30]  True.  The problem is these two are Yankee fans and they're, uh, well, not Jimmy anymore, but Jimmy  is going to Yankee Stadium.  And we're out.  I don't understand why you'd go to Yankee Stadium if you're not a fan of the team, but,  uh, there you go.  Congratulations to Derek Jeter, though.  Uh, most, most hits ever in Yankee Stadium.  Yeah.  And that's a record they say won't be broken.  Yeah, good for him.  They ripped the stadium down and he, uh, just beat, uh, Lou Gehrig, uh, for the most hits  ever in Yankee Stadium. 
[00:18:00]  But Lou Gehrig had that disease.  That's not fair.  To beat a guy with a disease?  Hmm, he had Derek Jeter disease?  Lou Gehrig had the disease.  Oh.  Oh.  That was named after him.  When he, he would have had more hits, right?  Didn't he retire early?  Because of that.  Yeah, but he was the luckiest man on earth.  He wasn't too lucky.  That's not a lucky man.  He said it right before he shook a lot and dropped dead.  How old was he when he died?  Ten.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  He wasn't that old, man.  He was a pretty young guy.  So, Derek Jeter got another hit?  Good for him.  Yeah.  And, of course.  Well, they, uh, lost.  Did they again?  Yeah.  What bums.  You know, screw the, the hit record.  We all want to know how many broads he's up to.  Yeah.  How many broads is Derek Jeter up to?  That's a record I want to, uh, keep track of.  I bet he passed the Bambino's, uh, record on that one.  Yeah.  Oh, the Bambino was, uh, quite the womanizer.  Wow.  Imagine that big, fat load of crap in bed with you. 
[00:19:00]  He must have had a hell of a personality because, uh, he was, he was, he was, he was no Brad  Pitt, that's for sure.  Man, these guys sat with presidents, man.  These baseball players, Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth.  Yeah.  They were gods.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing going on back then except for, like, Jim Crow laws and fat Babe Ruth.  So, why are you going to Yankee Stadium?  Because it's one of the last games there, Jimmy?  Yeah, I mean, look.  Sentimental.  I'm very irritated with the Yankees, but I'm still very in love with the older Yankees,  uh, you know, Reggie and Goose and Sparky Lyle and Billy Martin and Guidry. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, man.  Let's go with Billy Martin.  Bottom line is this.  I'm very irritated with the Yankees, but deep down, I'm still, you know, I'll probably root  for them.  I could never root against them, like with another team.  I get happy when they lose, like today, because I think they're playing, they're just  not allowed to do.  Oh, they're crap.  But I have to.  Three games left and Billy Mack had tickets, and my date is a stupid stump brain, because he's a  White Sox fan, so I'm like, yeah, all right, why not?  I mean, uh...  Stupid stump brain's right there.  I know, I know who he is, but it'll be fun to, I'm sure, have a good time. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, the stadium.  Yeah.  That's the last time you're going to be in there.  Shea Stadium is going away, too, but no one cares.  No one really cares.  No one cares, like the Yankee fans with this Yankee stadium.  I think Mets fans, true Mets fans, are just not going to go to the last game at Shea Stadium.  Why bother?  In honor of that crap hole, we're all staying home.  Well, so the Mets have how many games left.  They have plenty of games, too.  It's only one game, but it's annoying.  Yeah, they got a few games left.  I don't know the exact number, Jimmy. 
[00:20:30]  But should I wait?  That's what I'm saying.  Everyone's keeping track how many games left at Yankee Stadium, and the average Mets fan  doesn't really know how many games left at Shea Stadium.  They just know it's going away very soon.  You know who I bet could tell us?  Oh, Stubbrain?  Our sports reporter.  Oh, David.  When's David doing the coaching sports?  Whoa.  You'd all be dead now if it wasn't my David.  Yeah.  Hey, speaking of Boston, they're all talking about this crab apple tree up there.  What?  This is their big story today. 
[00:21:00]  They get some weird-ass stories up there.  All hell is breaking loose in the world, but they're concerned about a crab apple tree.  Or three old broads are.  Why?  This is a nice find.  Well, we're going to find out.  Three old broads in Boston don't want a crab apple tree cut down.  Crab apple's the worst.  Have you ever had a crab apple?  When you're a kid, you always bite into one, and all of a sudden your face gets that sour  thing going on.  It could be the most sour thing you could eat.  Yeah.  What is the most sour thing you could eat? 
[00:21:30]  A crab apple.  I'm thinking it might be a crab apple.  Alum.  A what?  Alum.  It's a chemical.  Why would you know that?  Because on cartoons, they would always give it to, like, a little rambunctious mouse would  give it to a cat that's trying to kill him or something, and he would give him some alum,  and his head would shrink.  First, he'd pucker up, and then his head would shrink because it was so sour.  Oh, I don't, uh...  No, I don't know alum.  Yeah, you didn't watch cartoons, Crab.  No, we did watch cartoons, but we didn't have to, like, study them like you. 
[00:22:00]  I went to college for cartoons.  Forget Aristotle and F*** Socrates.  What?  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Hi.  There you go.  Yeah, there.  That's wonderful.  So, uh...  Yeah, crab apples.  What do they do with crab apples?  Do they make anything?  No, they're meant to throw at your neighbors over the fence.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  That's pretty much why they exist.  We had the trees in our backyard, and it made great...  It was great for...  Yeah.  For backyard wars. 
[00:22:30]  We used to have, like, Lord of the Flies wars with another tribe of kids over our backyard  fence, and you'd just start lobbing crab apples and dirt bombs and stuff until somebody  threw that rock, and you'd just hear...  You wouldn't see your enemy.  That was the best thing, because the fence was a little too high for us kids, so you'd  just lob things.  You're, like, lobbing random artillery over the fence, and they're doing the same thing,  and it only ended when you heard...  After someone threw a rock, and then everyone ran away, and you'd see the kid in school the 
[00:23:00]  next day with a big cut on his head, a big band-aid.  Well, because you would make the rules, like, look, dirt bombs, no rocks in the dirt bomb.  Yeah, over the other side of the fence.  No rocks!  But then you're in the middle of this war, and you're like, you know what, I'm going  to just start throwing rocks, and no one's going to know I'm throwing the rock.  I didn't know it was a rock in a dirt bomb!  Yeah.  But crab apples were also very, very good for backyard warfare as a kid.  You'd do acorn fights?  Yeah, acorns were also used.  Very dangerous, too, though.  Were you, like, have an agreement, like, all right, for the next hour, collect as many 
[00:23:30]  acorns as possible?  No, no.  And then war on.  These things were very spontaneous, and usually with some kind of dislike.  It wasn't like, hey, let's have a war for fun.  And this was, I can't stand my backyard neighbor, so let's throw rocks at them.  You didn't have enough brothers growing up.  No, I had one.  I'm one of five boys, so we loved each other, but we also wanted to, you know, clock each  other in the head with rocks and acorns and apples and stuff.  Oh, so, yeah, you're doing like a, just like an exhibition game. 
[00:24:00]  Sure.  Just amongst one team.  You guys actually had little wars?  Dude, it was war.  Like, with the kids all around us in the other yards, over the fences.  Yeah.  That's what we did out on Long Island.  What nationality did you guys go after?  Everyone was white back then.  In your neighborhood?  No, on the world.  Yes, in my neighborhood.  I was in East Northport.  Yeah.  Let's try to find a black person in East Northport circa 1970-something. 
[00:24:30]  Well, now try to find a white person.  Exactly.  On Long Island.  Wow.  What's happening?  What's going on?  It's ethnic diversity and it's welcome.  It sure is.  Who said that?  Well, that's...  Well, look.  Go to Brentwood.  Go to Wine Danch.  Get out.  Shake some hands.  No?  Maybe if it's daylight.  Maybe.  Let's say hi to Amy in Michigan.  Amy.  Hi.  Hey.  How are you guys? 
[00:25:00]  Good.  What do you got, Amy?  Good.  I just wanted to tell Anthony that alum is not sour.  It's salty.  It's a pickling spice.  Oh, no.  A pickling spice.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  I just know from cartoons.  They puckered up and then their head shrunk.  I think it happened to Sylvester.  I think Tweety Bird put some alum in his mouth when he thought he was eating the bird.  Yeah.  All right, Amy.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Let's get into the story.  Three old ladies in Boston don't want the crabapple tree to be cut down. 
[00:25:30]  Do they blame it on black people?  That seems to be what happens up in Boston.  They haven't done that in 15 years.  Let it go.  I can't.  What year was that?  I don't know.  That Charles Stewart.  Wait, that was a...  That's a long time ago.  Every year up until 2010.  Meet Ethel, Pat, and Lee.  60, 70, and 80-something.  Wait, what are the names?  Ethel, Pat, and Lee.  Really?  Ethel. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, God.  Meet Ethel, Pat, and Lee.  60, 70, and 80-something-year-olds who are mad as heck, and they're not going to take it anymore.  Mad as heck?  My womb is dried up, and I'm mad as heck.  That's where she stores the crabapples.  The womb is being rented out as crabapple storage.  Is that them?  Oh, my God.  All right.  They're sitting out under the crab tree.  I see what we're getting at.  It looks like these broads, just like those hippies out west, they're not leaving the crabapple tree until they agree to not cut it down. 
[00:26:30]  But they can't climb the tree, so they got a little lawn furniture around the base of it.  It looks like a very suburban little neighborhood.  They're sitting on the grass right next to the road underneath the crabapple tree in some plastic backyard furniture.  Yeah.  Don't take it anymore.  I know what the main thing is.  It's a tree.  Right.  I don't care about the dumpster. 
[00:27:00]  They are angry that the Shrewsbury housing complex they live in is threatening to cut down this crabapple tree that sits right in front of their apartments and replace it with a dumpster.  To protest, they broke themselves to the tree.  I'll keep myself tied to that tree as long as I can until they take me to jail.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I just saw what they did.  They tied themselves there with, like, packing twine.  It's the littlest piece of string.  And they didn't even make a – they made half a knot. 
[00:27:30]  A single half a knot.  Yeah, half a square knot.  As in, if you just pull this dump thing, the broads will be free.  Pull this dump thing, meaning the women.  Yeah.  How great would it be if they sent in a SWAT team and they literally just bludgeoned them with nightsticks and dragged them away and then cut down the tree and each one of them was given 25 years?  Like some kind of a complete overreaction.  Just way over the top.  Oh, tased.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  And then beaten with batons.  Set the dogs on them.  Throw them in the car.  Tear gas them.  Tear gas them.  Oh, my goodness.  I can't breathe.  I got $500 to the first listener to go there with a chainsaw and just – don't touch the ladies.  Oh, would that be great.  Take the tree down.  $500 cold, hard cash.  You'll still get arrested for trespassing and destruction of property, I'm sure.  It'll be an easy ticket.  It'll be fun.  It'll be an easy ticket.  Go ahead. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, but they're tying themselves around the tree with this tiny little twine.  We have a – it's my knitting yawn.  Look at the knot.  We'll put the video up on onaradio.com.  Get away from the tree, you old bag.  All right.  It continues.  It's one knot.  I don't believe in killing live trees.  And then if it were dead and he had to take it down, I still don't want the dumpster here.  You see, it's not just the tree they're worried about. 
[00:29:00]  It's the stench.  Can you feel this breeze?  Can you feel – that's the only way it comes is this way.  And that smell is going to come right into our windows.  Yeah, of your diapers.  I cannot live in a shut, closed room because I have to smell garbage.  Smell garbage.  What happens to old broads, man?  They start sounding and looking like men.  It's men.  Yeah, look at that.  That's a man.  I think if you're married for too long – 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to figure out how to say this.  You've got to get out of it.  I think officially you become gay because –  I mean, there's no other way to say it.  Look at these broads.  There's nothing feminine about them.  And there's somebody probably married to them for 30, 40, 50 years.  Yeah.  And then they have the hot young reporter doing the story.  And you know these broads probably looked close to that back in the day.  I don't think Ethel did.  Maybe not Ethel, but maybe Pat.  Pat looks like she –  Look at this.  Oh, Ethel. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, Ethel.  How do you do that?  You get married to that.  And if you're married long enough, you're officially married to a dude.  To a guy.  What do you say?  Let's go to the movies.  No, you're a man.  Yeah, there's something that happens with those hormones.  Once those ovaries dry up, it's over, Johnny.  It sure is.  Facial hair.  They all get that sensible haircut.  She looks – she does look like Ernest Borgnine. 
[00:30:30]  You think the husbands are happy that these three are just kind of spending their time around a crab apple tree?  If they're lucky, they're dead.  She has hair like Starsky.  She's terrible, this old lady.  Oh, with their old lady clothes and –  This tree is –  Take it.  It's not even in nature.  It's part of like an apartment complex.  Yeah.  It's in the middle of the parking lot.  Yeah, you're at an apartment.  You're not in the rainforest, dummies. 
[00:31:00]  No, it's just a dumb tree they need to cut down so they can put a dumpster there so people can throw out their garbage.  And it's a little tree.  They just cut it down with them sitting there and it collapsed on them.  Timber, huh?  Right on them.  One of them had a broken back.  You think the guy cutting it down will yell timber?  Yes, they should.  The tree is like 10 feet tall.  It's nothing.  They should cut down the tree, put the dumpster in its place, and then throw Ethel, Pat, and Lee in the dumpster and drive away.  Wait a minute.  Did they nail a sign to the tree?  Yeah.  Well, that's not good for the tree. 
[00:31:30]  They put nails in the tree.  A leave our tree alone sign is nailed to the tree.  These old ladies are stupid.  How about they nail the sign to themselves and see how much that hurts?  What it feels like.  Poor tree.  Wouldn't it be funny, though, if one of them set themselves on fire in protest where they started doing, like, terrorist activities?  Like, cutting people's throats in the neighborhood?  And they knew it was them because it was a crab apple in the throat.  They crystallized my pupa.  We've got to get one of our listeners down there to see what's going on. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sure there's a lot of media checking out the old broads trying to save the crab apples.  We should try to get in touch with at least one of them.  Yeah, let's get them on the phone.  Get their plight out on the air.  Maybe it'll help if we spread the word for them.  All right.  That's right.  One more quick clip.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree.  And I can't see why they cut. 
[00:32:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold the phone.  Why wasn't this edited?  Oh, my God.  These old ladies have potty mouths.  I don't believe it.  I can't believe the potty mouths on these old broads.  I think we just lost 350 G's, my friend.  What happened?  I say play it again.  All right.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree. 
[00:33:00]  And I can't see.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, lady.  Come on now.  This is national television and radio we're talking here.  Oh.  The second one's even better.  I know.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree.  And I can't see why they can't fix.  All right. 
[00:33:30]  Hold the phone.  This now is the best story ever.  Why is she saying that?  That's how you say it in Boston and Shrewsbury.  You've been there.  Oh, okay.  I forgot.  It's the accent.  Oh, I wish they'd talk about caulk.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wowie, wow, wow.  Wow, wowie, wow, wow. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  This is a great clip now.  All right.  Who gives a crap about this dumb crap out of the tree?  Can we please just play that until nine?  Sure.  Let's get the whole clip on the air here.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a  better option than cutting down a tree.  And I can't see why they can't fix the dumpster, why they can't fix the pad.  I mean, I'd like to know them to tell me why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad. 
[00:34:30]  I'm sure if I was young, I could fix it.  Yeah.  You three old can'ts.  That's the line right there.  Can't one, can't two, can't three.  Go indoors and knit a blanket.  Get in there.  Wow. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  That must be awkward when she's out, out of state.  Are you, what?  Wouldn't you call me?  Oh, wow.  I wish we could just go with this one.  Wowie, wow.  That's, uh, all right.  I wish we could go with this one.  I want to see more of these broads on, uh, I would say someone go there and interview  them and just make her say that as many times as possible.  That's the bit.  That's the bit.  Yeah.  That's the bit.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Oh, Anthony, someone is, uh, on the line. 
[00:35:30]  They said that they're, they're just tuning in.  They don't even know what's going on with this story.  Oh.  So we're going to have to play this clip again.  Yeah.  What's the, what's the story for the people just tuning in?  Three old broads, uh, live in an apartment complex and, uh, there's a crab apple tree that  they like to sit under.  Yeah.  Apparently.  And they're going to chop it down and put a dumpster there.  Yeah.  So these three old bags are a little upset about it.  They're from Boston.  Um, Shrewsbury, Shrewsbury, excuse me.  Go local for the boys.  I know.  They're, uh, very upset about this. 
[00:36:00]  And so, so they're tying themselves with the knitting yarn, my knitting yarn, my knitting  yarn, they're tying themselves to the tree, uh, in protest.  Uh, and, uh, the news went and interviewed them.  Yeah.  And got some statements from them.  And they're very, very upset.  Very upset.  Apparently very upset.  And we don't have time to play all the clips.  So I think the last clip is the one.  It sums it up.  Yes.  I think it sums it up.  Yeah.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to  be a better option than cutting down a tree. 
[00:36:30]  And I can't see why they can't fix the dumpster, why they can't fix the pad.  I mean, I'd like to know them to tell me why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad.  Yeah.  I'm sure if I was young, I could fix it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you.  Does anyone laugh at her? 
[00:37:00]  Huh?  Does anyone, like, family members or stuff, when they visit and she talks and then the  little kids are around, did you hear what Grandma said?  No.  Make her say it again.  Can I fly to the moon?  See, if we even imitated what they're saying there, they would dump out.  Exactly.  We have played this perfectly.  Grandma's using the same word.  Daddy uses it for mommy. 
[00:37:30]  Well, best of luck to the old bags.  And a little advice.  Maybe they should say cannot.  Yes, get a new, get some other woman to speak.  Because no one's taking you seriously if you're saying it that way.  It just, that's all I'm fixated on now.  Oh, I just want to play it over and over again.  You're saying that.  I bet you they do it on purpose.  I bet you when the news left, she's like, I got foreign.  Oh, that's great.  They played it on the news.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:38:00]  Don't we have a listener nearby that we can interview him for the show?  I'm sure there's somebody in Shrewsbury listening.  You think they're out there 24 hours a day?  I'll tell you this much.  It's kind of a, not a big story, but it's a story in Boston, so I'm sure some news crews will be on hand today.  Hey, I know who lived in Shrewsbury.  Maybe he can go there.  Rock out.  Hey, you old bitch.  Want to smoke a joint?  You got something for me to eat?  You have any grandchildren? 
[00:38:30]  How hard would it be to cut the tree down?  Wait till they all go to the bathroom.  It probably happens like once every five minutes.  They all go to come back.  I have to go get changed.  Change her ditey.  Just cut it down while Ethel's got her feet in the air like a baby.  Being powdered.  Exactly.  While someone's dealing with, quote, the burden.  Everyone's got their can't joke, and we just can't do that.  No, well, of course. 
[00:39:00]  We've, you know.  I think we got away with murder today.  Let's just keep it where it's at.  That's good.  Yeah.  All right.  Good story.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  What did he get you?  He got me some clear anti-itch lotion.  I've got mosquito bites.  Yeah.  Yes.  Does Kalman Lotion work?  It stops the itch.  It's a toothpaste.  It's a what?  Toothpaste is the best for mosquito itch.  Stop it.  My grandmother, God rest his soul, told me that toothpaste was the mosquito itch way. 
[00:39:30]  I heard that, yes.  She was correct.  Yes.  Really?  I'd put a little bit of Crest or whatever type of toothpaste I had on my itch, and by  golly, it was gone.  Yeah, well, it's 2008.  That's right.  They make things for this.  Oh, that's, oh, how soothing.  Thanks.  All right.  Clear.  Hey, is there any more audio of the three broads?  Please.  Please find all audio clips of the three broads.  We're not done with this story.  This is a big concern for us on the Opie and Anthony show.  Love these old bats.  We've got to help them save this crab off. 
[00:40:00]  Yes, please.  All right.  We've got a break.  Crab off.  Oh, guys.  I wish we could go to the phones right now.  Yeah.  Trust me.  It's killing me.  We know just where to go.  It's killing me today.  How great would it be to go out there at night and put a landmine so when they put their  chair on it, one of them is blown to smithering.  What happened to Ethel?  Ethel's leg is in the tree.  Her leg is where the dumpster is going to go. 
[00:40:30]  Ethel's meat.  Is Steve looking up their phone numbers?  Let's try to get one of these.  Hello.  Which one was talking, though?  We don't know.  That's the thing.  We have to watch the video.  The video may help, but I'm sure he'll guess.  Would you like to be a foundry cam girl?  I'll promote your cran apple tree organization.  Cran apple.  What is this?  Crab apple.  Whatever it is.  It's a tree that grows wonderful juice.  Yes. 
[00:41:00]  Cran apple.  I want to thank Boston for giving us the story of the day.  Yeah, thank you.  A big hi to everyone listening on BCN.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I want to thank Bored Up Mike up there at BCN for sending that crab apple story.  Fantastic.  He just gave me a communique.  He wrote, that story was apparently a Fox News exclusive for the local affiliate. 
[00:41:30]  I will keep looking for more audio of the three old broads.  Oh, please.  We need them.  Oh, yeah.  It was a throwaway story until we heard how they said, can't.  Opie and Anthony.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Well, we got someone else apologizing.  What a doodle.  Everyone has to apologize now.  Yeah.  We're a sorry, sorry nation, aren't we?  Constantly.  I'm sorry.  Some of the groups offended at something someone said in humor.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Just faggy, annoying America.  It doesn't even get to the point where a group actually gets offended.  Everyone is in such a high alert.  Preemptive apologizing.  I think I might have said something wrong.  Oh, my God.  Apologize.  Just in case.  I want to apologize for something I might do.  There you go.  It's a preemptive apology there.  So now if I do something, it's covered.  Yeah.  We're just winging this.  We might say something stupid.  Yeah.  So we're going to apologize.  Apologize now.  And that's just as sincere, by the way, as any apology anyone gives for these things because  they don't really mean it. 
[00:42:30]  Of course.  We never did.  No.  XM forced us to apologize now that, you know, now that we're not really officially part  of XM anymore.  Now that all those flunkies are out.  Now that, yeah, the higher ups, they're all gone.  We can now officially say, yeah, they forced us to apologize for something that we didn't  want to apologize about.  Remember that time you took a dump on Yupanera's desk?  God, was that hysterical.  Oh, was that funny.  They typed out an apology.  They basically had a gun to, I think, Anthony's head. 
[00:43:00]  I think they...  Literally, not basically.  Yes, I was at gunpoint.  Because your sound bite that they used on the news was pretty bad because they chopped it  out of a 20-minute bit.  So they felt like, this is how calculated they are.  They're like, Anthony needs to read this.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Because the people out there have a problem with Anthony.  And my apology was, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was no emotion.  I read it like a Vulcan.  Can we find that?  Your apology.  Iraq, can we find that?  Today, we should play that because it's apology day because Tony Kornheiser had to apologize. 
[00:43:30]  There was no reason to apologize, first of all.  They forced us to and we were so pissed and we were yelling and screaming behind the scenes.  Like, we don't want to apologize.  We had nothing to do with this.  I mean, it's our show, but a homeless guy was ranting and raving for 20 minutes.  And people should understand.  That's all it was.  I was just kidding.  I was just going to say that being homosexuals is not a crime.  Oh.  Oh.  Of course not.  You got me going there, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Literal lope.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's all right.  I'm sorry.  No, that's all right.  I wasn't setting it up like a joke. 
[00:44:00]  I was just kind of saying it like it's conversational.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But I'm glad we could finally say it.  And you can hear in Anthony's voice because he's like, and then he like rips up the apology  right afterwards and throws it away.  Oh, yeah.  And then we got the call.  You guys did good today.  Shut up.  I thought we were finished, to be honest with you.  I was very nervous.  Well, there was a person with the company that wanted us to be done, and it should be said  that Eric Logan kind of stepped in and saved our asses.  Threw his retard hairdo on the bomb for us and took it.  Can our governor shave? 
[00:44:30]  No.  Like Friday mist.  It wasn't a question.  Yeah.  I was stating, you know, can he please shave?  He was shaving his face, and all of a sudden they realized, hey, there's a pumpkin with  no shavings on it.  What did you do?  And he goes, oh, I thought that was my head and face.  They're like, you bat.  You know what?  He's trying for this look.  I don't know if he's going for the old stubble look, but it's not working.  Because he's got to find someone to shave him every day. 
[00:45:00]  He's going for the tippy-tom look.  Why don't we have blind shaving day?  We all grow a beard for three or four days, and then we'll try to shave.  And then we blindfold it.  Wow.  All right.  Because that's what he's dealing with.  I'm sure he's...  It's the first annual Governor Google-ize blind shaving.  You know, this Governor Patterson's, you know, he's getting a lot of respect out there.  He definitely is.  You know, I thought it was a joke at first, but now you read up on the guy, and he's doing 
[00:45:30]  all right.  He's making some tough decisions and choices for the...  But on financial matters, because the state's in some pretty bad shape.  And he's made cuts.  He's not one for overtaxing, which I kind of like.  But yeah, he seems to be doing it.  And he does.  He's got respect from his peers.  He really does.  Yeah.  But he doesn't shave.  The blind thing's not getting in the way for Mr. Patterson. 
[00:46:00]  The shaving thing might be something related to ingrown hairs.  And a lot of our African-American friends have beard issues, and they get ingrown hairs.  Razor bumps.  Yes, sir.  I remember talking to some guy at work many years ago about his problem with razor bumps.  I think that's racist, and you should apologize.  Absolutely.  Yeah, why don't you...  Please.  You better apologize.  I say you're sorry.  Not all African-Americans have problems.  Not all.  That's right.  I said some.  Only the dark ones.  I said 99.9%.  You implied. 
[00:46:30]  It's very hard.  Jesus, Opie.  Apologize to the light-skinned ones.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, you're offensive.  All right, listen, why don't we get this Tony Kornheiser thing on the air fast?  Tony makes a joke about the Spanish play-by-play.  So it's Monday night football.  Felix Jones kickoff return for a touchdown.  A lot of excitement.  And this is what happened on Monday night football.  Here's what it sounded like on ESPN Deportes.  He's a key.  And nobody will touch it. 
[00:47:00]  Nobody will touch it.  Felix, down!  There she is.  Sorry, now for Martín, who does the play-by-play for all the Monday night football games, along  with former kicker Raul Allegra.  I took high school Spanish, and that either means nobody is going to touch him, or could  you pick up my dry cleaning in the morning?  It's one of those two.  Okay.  I don't really get the joke.  It's a bad joke.  I think he means, does he mean like a hired help pick up my laundry in the morning? 
[00:47:30]  Is that what he was trying to go for?  I don't even know.  You can't really tell, because it could be the Spanish guy is saying to somebody, could  you pick up my dry cleaning in the morning?  Like, that's what, you know what I mean?  How is that a problem?  Spanish people don't have dry cleaning that he picked up?  It could also be self-deprecating that his Spanish is so bad from his high school Spanish,  it either means that or that, I don't know, I'm stupid.  So he could play it off as that, but I think he meant, like, when you have help at the 
[00:48:00]  house, and they're normally of a Hispanic background.  Yeah, but if you say that, then that's racist, too.  But you're right.  But you're right.  Sorry, it's just the way it is.  Yeah.  That, you know, pick up my laundry in the morning.  Mm-hmm.  That might have been what he meant.  Why is that bad to say?  Uh, because then you're implying that, uh, Spanish people are, um, in the service industry.  Yeah, servant at houses.  And they're not?  Yes, they are.  Are you kidding me?  A lot of... 
[00:48:30]  The one thing we see when we're driving in, Kenny and I, when he, you know, drives, uh,  to the station at five in the morning, is nothing, I swear to you, nothing but Hispanics coming  out of the, uh, of the subways.  Well, yeah.  And going to work before they have to, they have to open up all these joints.  And the cleaning industries.  The cleaning, the restaurants.  It's, it's, it's all Spanish people coming out of the subways at around five in the morning.  That's their rush hour.  Celebrate.  Because they got to get their way ahead of, uh, Whitey.  Diversity. 
[00:49:00]  They do a lot of jobs that other people don't want to do.  I'll tell you that.  When I was in L.A. shooting Lucky Louie, uh, every day I would drive and you would see  at Home Depot a bunch of, uh, a bunch of immigrants just trying to get work.  I mean, they would actually stand outside of Home Depot hoping that people would need  help and, uh, just wanting to, just want to work.  The commute is very different depending on the hour of day.  I mean, five, five 30 is a, is a big hour for, uh, for the people in the service industry.  Service industry.  Let's just put it that way.  So Tony Kornheiser, he knew he might be in trouble. 
[00:49:30]  So he, uh, he did his apology.  How long after?  I don't know.  Like it was the same game though, right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  A little before the guy spiked the football.  Probably.  Before the extra point.  Yeah.  Well, with the NFL, we celebrate the football Americano.  Noche de Independencia.  Independence Day, Mexico.  We're going to have to play tomorrow.  On that subject, I said something before I shouldn't have said.  I apologize for it.  Not my first mistake. 
[00:50:00]  Undoubtedly won't be my last.  But a 100% apology.  100%.  I would have said that was about an 86% apology.  Whatever.  God.  I would have said, look, the higher up, they're a little nervous.  So I'm going to just say this.  Wow.  He had a 100% apology.  Please don't fire me.  I need this job.  That's what he was saying.  Translate that.  Don't fire me.  Don't fire me.  Don't fire me.  Don't fire me.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Please, I need this job. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  God.  It's all of us, too.  We're all responsible for it somehow by letting it happen.  Mm-hmm.  Put a bunch of...  Not all.  We did our job.  We were yelling and screaming.  We did our job.  We apologized.  Well.  God, you're right, Anthony.  When you're right, you're right.  Ah, they make you do it.  But, you know, when other people apologize, yeah, you're right.  What am I saying?  You're right.  I could have my pride and live in my car.  I'd rather not live in my car.  You could be a groveling worm and bang 20-year-olds or be pride, prideful and live in your car. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  Yeah, but I...  And deal with some yent of my own age.  Exactly.  What option did Anthony take?  Well, he recently hooked a fish.  I see.  I think we did our apology in our way, though.  It was obvious to the hardcore listeners, oh, my God, they're being forced to do this.  There was nothing sincere about our apology at the time.  I think everybody's being forced.  It's, uh, yeah.  It's how you spit it out. 
[00:51:30]  I'll tell you, it sounded damn sincere.  Bad news, boys.  Steve got a hold of Ethel.  She refused to be interviewed.  What?  Why?  The crabapple...  What happened?  Oh, did Steve say something silly?  I'm sure he did it wrong.  Can we get Steve in here to see how he blew it?  I'm sure...  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Well, he'll have...  Excuse me.  We really liked the way you said,  uh, could you please get on the air?  Yes.  Steve, what did you say to Ethel?  What happened?  What did you say to Ethel?  I could not have been more flattering to this little old lady who was very polite, 
[00:52:00]  who I just woke up.  Oh, that's why you just woke her up.  Oh, the tree's unguarded?  Uh, apparently.  Oh, that's good news.  I couldn't have been more polite.  I was very complimentary.  I said, the story's getting some national attention, and we saw your story on the local  Fox station, and we'd really, really like to get your comments on the air.  And she said, oh, I... 
[00:52:30]  Our husband probably gave her a fat...  What'd she say?  I'm not going to say it.  She can't.  She said that?  So you found the one that says it?  Oh, I know.  I found the one.  I found the one.  Oh, my God.  Call her back.  Call her back.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We found...  She said, I...  Yeah, I can't.  Oh, trust me.  But I...  She said...  Almost started laughing.  And then what...  Well, like, what was her reason?  She was too embarrassed.  She wanted to pawn me off on the other two that weren't saying the... 
[00:53:00]  Is that why...  Wait, she...  Wait a minute.  I got to make sure Steve was talking to the right person.  Trust me.  Yeah, that's a good idea, Ope.  Three ladies.  Good idea.  How long have you been doing radio, you dope?  Come on.  Oh, Jimmy caught it.  My dear sweet God.  Jimmy caught it.  I thought you were fishing the CD out.  Of course I caught it.  Are you insane?  I can get that.  No, I assure you it was her.  So I guess there's no reason to call the audio, right, Steve?  Yeah, put that away, Ope.  You know what? 
[00:53:30]  You might want to.  I could have been mistaken.  Oh, there you go.  I could have been mistaken.  Holy crap.  When improv-ing, give away the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Do you know that the two Jewish...  I couldn't make it more obvious.  The two Jewish owners of a bar walked into it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my...  The chicken was on the other side of the road.  That's why you crossed it.  My wife had never been to the kitchen, and then she asked me to take her somewhere.  She'd never been, so I said, how about the kitchen, considering you haven't been there? 
[00:54:00]  Boo.  I ruined things.  Oh, my God.  I ruined things.  Can we back up the tape to really...  I ruined things.  ...really show the audience what just happened?  Oh, my God.  We have in our possession audio that is considered radio gold.  Yes.  So, as a radio show, we are going to find a million excuses to play this audio.  And Steve doesn't get that.  No.  Jimmy the truck is saying, go swing your pendulum, you shim. 
[00:54:30]  So, we're...  Wow.  So, Opie was saying, gee, are you sure you had the right...  Like, it was such an obvious wink.  Yeah.  It was a wink, like...  And the part I was going to play is, well, Steve, you sure?  Here's the audio.  Is this the one you talk to?  Hence, we get the can't word out there a few more times.  And then you go, yes.  Yes, that's the one.  And then you wink back at me and go, yes.  Not, no, no, no, no, no.  I assure you it's okay.  This is how the executive producer of the show handled this. 
[00:55:00]  Is that why...  Wait, she...  Wait a minute.  I got to make sure Steve was talking to the right person.  Trust me.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Three ladies.  Good idea.  How long have you been doing that?  Trust me.  Trust me.  I was an excited boy.  Trust me.  I was talking to the right person.  There were three ladies.  I ruined things.  Oh, my God. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, my God.  That is a classic what?  Oh, my God.  Well, this is...  I think this is...  Oh, brother.  Let's just play it.  All right.  What are we doing?  We think it's funny the way she says things.  Yeah, we just like her accent.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree. 
[00:56:00]  And I can't see why they can't fix the dumpster, why they can't fix the pad.  I mean, I'd like to know them to tell me why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad.  I'm sure if I was young, I could fix it.  Yeah.  And if you think local TV is different than shock jock radio shows, you're completely mistaken.  Yes. 
[00:56:30]  They knew exactly what they had and made sure they got it on the news for the same reason we're doing it.  No one gives a crap about three old ladies and a crab apple tree in Shrewsbury.  Well, we do.  We want to get one on the phone.  Yeah, now go work.  That one.  Go work her.  Maybe you woke her up, and now that she's had her cup of tea, she'll come on our show.  Here it is.  Here's the angle you used, though.  Look, we can help the cause.  The guys, very interested in this.  One of them actually was in Oregon in a tree to save trees, and they understand your plight. 
[00:57:00]  You know, just talk it up, the old broad.  You say they have influence there.  Yes.  Say it's Opie and Anthony and their sidekick, Jim Shrewsbury.  Yeah.  Of the Shrewsbury family.  He's of the Shrewsbury's.  Crab apple lover.  Yes, crab apple lover, but say they dealt with a similar situation over a dumpster being  proposed.  But, you know, whatever.  Miss Crabtree, we enjoyed her on Little Rascals, whatever it takes.  I assume you didn't say Opie and Anthony, you know, the shock jocks that said the mayor 
[00:57:30]  was inside the car accident.  They really like how you say the word can't, and they want to put you on the air to humiliate  you.  Talk a lot about things that you not can do.  I was much more delicate than that.  Let's say hi to Sam in Pennsylvania.  Sam.  Hey, I just think this deserves a good old end.  That's how you executive produce.  Yes.  There you go.  All right, Sam.  And that's how you executive produce.  Of course it is.  Not only am I gay and incompetent, but I'm stupid. 
[00:58:00]  Just trying to find reasons to play this audio all morning long.  Steve.  That's the bit today.  The youngest of the palin' children.  I ruin things.  Yes.  Who's Kat DeLuna?  She's a singer.  I know she's a singer.  It's like dance music.  She played on KTU and stations like that. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, so she's a popular pop artist?  She's got one hit that bounced around and is starting to break through.  This is a pretty hot video right now.  Well, we've got to get the skateboarding dudes on onaradio.com.  You think that's a real video, Ant?  The one they were showing on the news here in New York?  I'm sure.  Oh, the one where they're speeding down the...  Supposedly two guys out there in California?  Yeah, 60 miles an hour.  Yeah, I'd believe it.  Sure.  They got up to 60 miles an hour on a skateboard, and they're wearing just the lame skateboard helmets. 
[00:59:00]  That's it.  No real pads or nothing.  No, it's 60.  If you dump on your skateboard, wow.  Going downhill.  They got up to 60 miles an hour.  They're following a car, and they're...  They passed a car.  They passed a car.  Yeah.  They're passing a video camera back and forth between them.  Yeah.  And they got some great video, and it's like, wow.  Pretty sick.  How the hell did they stop?  I don't know.  Hit something? 
[00:59:30]  A car hitting them, hopefully.  I understand you pushed down hard, but can you get that skateboard to stop pretty good?  Mm-hmm.  If you're up at...  I want to know how the video ended.  That's what I need to know.  Uh, probably boring, like a nice long straightaway, or it goes uphill after that.  They probably had it figured out, right?  Yeah.  That's a good point.  No, I don't think they had it figured out.  They seem pretty reckless.  That's insane.  Who's going to do that?  I think the man was tethered to a helicopter, and then when it was time to go, he just leaped  in the air, and the helicopter went higher and took him somewhere.  That's what I heard. 
[01:00:00]  Let's link that video, though, to onaradio.com.  Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I figured out why Ethel wouldn't do the interview, because when Steve woke her up, she didn't  have her clothes on yet.  Are you wearing your clothes?  I just imagine that Steve just blew it on the phone.  We've got to tape Steve on the phone trying to get these people on.  Hi, you don't mind if they make fun of you on the radio, do you?  Yeah, exactly.  You old bat. 
[01:00:30]  All right, so Kat DeLuna screws up one of the last notes singing the National Anthem  at the Cowboys game, and she, well, she gets a lot of cheers.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's way too high.  That's way too high.  Oh, no. 
[01:01:00]  No, they're just yelling, Lou.  Well, they say that national anthem is a hard song to sing.  They were booing her, though, for adding something, probably.  Just sing the dumb song.  It's that vocal friggin' acrobatics that she's doing. 
[01:01:30]  They're all trying to reenact the Whitney Houston national anthem thing.  With their trills.  Just sing the song.  Whatever, that's not that great to play today.  Does anybody remember Robert Klein?  It's Stephen Card to do it.  Robert Klein did a bit years ago on Jose Feliciano singing the national anthem.  He was one of the first guys to change it publicly.  Wow, I remember that bit.  Yeah.  I don't know if anybody ever heard it.  I don't think I ever heard it from Dodgers World Series. 
[01:02:00]  I remember that, but I do.  I remember him doing that bit.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Not much to it, Jim.  Just remember it.  Yeah, that's all we're doing.  Now we're reminiscing like the old broads under the apple tree.  Yeah, I can't remember.  Why don't my grandparents, my grandchildren come see me anymore?  You're among friends, Ethel.  Are we doing kosher sports next, Sam?  Sure hope so.  Are we?  Yes.  Are we?  Yes.  You'll be dead now if I wasn't my David.  David. 
[01:02:30]  David.  Just to wrap this up, we've got to take a break, Mike, but real fast, what do you got  on skateboarding?  Listening on BCA.  Mike?  What's up, Mike?  Hey, just want to let you guys know that the record for fastest speed on a skateboard is  over 90 miles an hour.  That record was actually not true.  They said there was a record.  They realized that that film had been sped up.  The 90 mile an hour film.  All right, way to go with that, Mike. 
[01:03:00]  Opie and Anthony.  What's up, everyone?  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  I guess people are still buying albums, huh?  Metallica.  490,000 copies of their new album.  First week out.  Right.  Wow.  I'm sure that's a lot of iTunes, right?  Hmm. 
[01:03:30]  I don't even know where you buy CDs anymore.  Is that included in the count now?  Yeah, iTunes, when you buy the album.  It has to be.  There's no record stores.  I know.  There's no record stores in Manhattan.  You go to Circuit City or Best Buy, they have a little section.  And I mean a little section.  Those sections are being squashed down to nothing.  Yep.  I hate uploading a CD.  When you get a CD, all you do is upload it to iTunes anyway, so you can play it on your iPod.  You can play it on your computer.  You can perhaps do something else with it.  You could enjoy it.  You could... 
[01:04:00]  MP3 player.  iPod.  iPod.  iTunes.  Another quickie about music.  No.  I used to...  I used to...  I don't want to say love, but I used to like Coldplay a lot.  But that new song is the most overplayed song in the history of music.  What song is it?  Every effing store you go in, If I Rule the World, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:04:30]  It's on all the time.  Maybe you could help us out there, E-Rock.  Even like radio stations that have no business playing Coldplay are playing this song.  Oh, yeah?  It has to be the most overplayed song in the history of music.  It has to be.  This one?  This thing.  And also, they're changing their sound to sound a little more like you, too.  Yeah?  This thing is everywhere. 
[01:05:00]  I am...  Everywhere.  I must not be listening to the stations that are playing it.  Well, you're a shut-in.  No, no.  I listen to a lot of music.  I'm talking about out and about, not in your personal, I'm-gonna-pick-my-music type of way.  I drive a lot, and I listen to music all the time, but...  You don't hear this song?  Not on lithium.  No, well, lithium's a good station.  Not the drug, the channel.  You can hear this on WFAG.  Oh, do they?  Yeah, 24 hours of Coldplay.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Just a dumb observation. 
[01:05:30]  I gotta download that Godsmack song.  That remake of the Zeppelin song.  Oh, Good Times, Bad Times?  Yeah, that was a great version.  That was part of their greatest hit CD that came out.  Holy God.  Yeah, Sully did a great...  That's a brave move to redo a Zeppelin song.  That's brave.  And they pulled it off big time.  Did it really well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the days of my youth, I was taught what it means to be a man.  You pointed out yesterday, the drums on this, it's just so punchy.  Now I've reached that age, I try to do all those things the best I can. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  It's great.  No matter how I try, I'll find my way to the same old jam.  Good times, bad times, you know I've had my shame.  Godsmack, you idiots.  I'm a woman and told for a man, and I still don't seem to care. 
[01:06:30]  Do-do-do.  Did someone actually write on PalTalk, do an original song?  Like, Godsmack hasn't done original songs.  There's so many stupid people.  I know.  They want to cover a Zeppelin song.  They do a great job, and someone's got to, like, do something original.  No, Godsmack, they don't even listen with half an ear.  Like, just listen with half an ear to this show, and we explain everything for you.  Oh, God.  Godsmack is a very original band. 
[01:07:00]  They barely do covers.  I think that's the first cover they actually released officially.  In concert, they do, you know, some homage to some of the great drummers of the past.  If you've seen a Godsmack show, you know what I'm talking about.  They're great live, too.  They're amazing live.  Sully, he just rocks.  We've got to get them on the show.  Yeah.  Good egg.  I think it's time for Kosher Sports, right?  Yeah.  We're ready.  We're ready?  Yeah.  There's something else I want to mention, but. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, that Crabapple Tree story.  Yeah.  What Crabapple?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, there's a story.  No, you don't need to play that.  There's a story in Boston.  Don't make me happy about that.  You were so in tune with what I was trying to do.  Oh, God.  It's my stupid brilliance with this dumb show, and he stomps all over it.  Thank you.  Thanks, Steve.  Thank you. 
[01:08:00]  I'll definitely be happy to interview them when I'm up in Boston, although the shows are sold out.  Wow.  Thank you to the Open Anthony Radio program.  One show, not enough for Jimmy.  See, you have that one guy that just doesn't like it.  One show, not enough for Jimmy.  Needed to.  That is huge, man.  Bing, bing, you knock him out.  All right.  We'll do the Crabapple story for the people just tuning in, because it's a biggie for Boston.  Well, it certainly is.  We'll revisit that after Kosher Sports.  So, do you want to?  I guess we'll do the intro and all that first.  Sure. 
[01:08:30]  Hold on, David.  You got an intro and everything.  David.  David.  He's been an intern for two days, I believe, and he's already a star on the show.  How did that happen?  You'll be dead now if it wasn't my David.  That's why.  It's time for Kosher Sports with our host, intern David.  Hello, David.  How are you?  Very good.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Great.  Now, last week you did Kosher Sports, right?  That is correct. 
[01:09:00]  And we told you not to tell Mommy and Daddy what you're doing for the Open Anthony Show,  because we know Mommy and Daddy would probably tell you not to do Kosher Sports.  That is correct.  You did say that.  Yeah.  And?  How did that work out?  It worked out fine.  They don't know about Kosher Sports yet.  Oh, they don't.  They have no idea.  They don't know it exists.  I've heard stories.  Stories.  How did you get here in the morning? 
[01:09:30]  What stories have you heard?  Uh-oh.  How do I get here in the morning?  I get a ride here.  Yeah, you get a ride here.  Yeah.  Do you know who the ride is?  Who?  Is that what you heard?  No, no.  I was just wondering.  I know you get a ride here, but I didn't know from who.  It's actually a ride from my father.  Ah, I knew that.  You did?  Yeah.  How did you know?  I didn't tell you.  I didn't tell you.  Because when you were trying to, I guess, pick up on some girls last time at the satellite. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I mentioned to them that I get a ride from my father.  Yeah, yeah.  You mentioned a lot of things.  How the hell are you going to pick up girls if you mention that?  Smooth move.  I think because, I think I mentioned it because one of the girls said, how do you get here?  You should have said something more dignified, like, I molest children up the street until  I arrive.  And then you asked one of the girls out, and she said no, and you said, I think we're making,  I thought we were making a connection.  This girl reported every detail of our conversation to you? 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  Of course.  They live at my house.  Oh, my God.  Was he really?  Oh, yeah.  He was trying.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  He didn't know.  I asked her out.  She said no.  Yeah.  And then what did I say?  You said, I thought we were making a connection.  I did say that.  That's right.  And then you hung around after everyone left, and you could have left because you thought  you were going with her somewhere to, like, lunch. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  This is the exact, exact story, word for word, of what happened last time.  Wow.  Well, he's getting the inside info, David.  I was kidding.  It was, they're not living at my house.  It was baby girl, but.  But this is word for word.  She told you word for word exactly what happened.  Coin, city yourself.  Reject.  Celibate.  Yes.  Okay.  Hey, David, before you do kosher sports.  Yes.  That's, that's a, that's amazing.  Oh, it's hysterical. 
[01:11:30]  And they were trying to get him to show his, his BD.  That is correct.  I'm kind of bummed you don't like his nickname.  I kind of like it.  Because apparently it's not true.  Big D, David.  That's the beauty of it.  If he had some B, Big D.  You're not following the nickname protocol.  Oh, like calling the fat guy Tiny?  There you go.  Oh.  That's why Big D, David works with this kid.  All right.  That's good.  Hey, Sam, I'm going to call you Whitey.  See?  Oh, yeah.  Hold on one second.  Hey, talented Eric. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, Eric's throwing stuff now.  That's not good.  Fair enough.  Why aren't you calling him Hoagie Boy today?  I would have got you Hoagie Boy.  All right.  Hoagie Boy.  Uh, Coke Logic.  Coke Logic.  Yes.  He's got an animation.  This has nothing to do with anything, but I need to get a plug-in that I wanted to do  about 20 minutes ago.  So, he's uploading a new animation based on, uh...  No way.  Uh...  Hoagie?  No, uh...  Jesus.  Uh... 
[01:12:30]  Rooster and, uh...  Oh, Rooster and, uh...  Turquoise Rooster.  Turquoise Rooster.  There's going to be an animation.  Oh, Coke Logic's animations are really good.  Where are those?  O&A Radio?  O&A Radio.  Yeah, but he...  Wow, I got to see that.  He's right on the front page, and the Brewer story was great.  I don't know if you saw that one.  I did not.  Oh, it's when he was in the hotel room with...  We haven't promoted Coke Logic's animations lately, but O&A Radio.com has a whole bunch  of them, and a new one featuring Turquoise Rooster is going to be up there later today.  When's it going up?  He's a bum, this Coke Logic. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know.  Maybe you could call her...  Put it up, lazy.  ...or send another instant feedback.  Put it up, lazy.  No, don't show us the animation now.  David!  David!  Yes.  David!  You'll all be dead now if it wasn't my David.  My David!  Uh, David.  Yes.  I, uh...  I'm obsessed with David's writing.  Wow, yeah.  I took a picture of this.  It's up on O&A Radio.com.  You write like a serial killer.  I, I, I was, I was into the Son of Sam case back in the day.  Uh-huh.  And there's similarities in the writing style and the, and the font.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  The chicken scratch font.  Is that, or Zodiac Killer.  All that, yeah.  It's got really a, a very, a serial killer-ish, a handwriting.  Yeah.  And he made some notes for himself for your interview, right?  Hey, could we get a handwriting analyst?  Yes.  To look at that?  Brilliant.  Because they could probably really come across and tell us a little more about my David.  I actually suggested that last week and nobody listened to me.  You did not!  Stop it!  You're right.  My idea!  No, you're right.  I was just trying to steal it. 
[01:14:00]  I wanted credit.  We all just want credit for the stuff we do for this show.  We're so pathetic.  All right, I'm good for another year.  Go ahead, David.  You want to say?  I was going to say, did you know that the Son of Sam was actually Jewish?  Yes.  Yes.  Berkowitz.  Oh, we didn't know Berkowitz was Jewish?  What?  Oh, we didn't know?  We know now.  So what do you, uh, uh, are you proud of that?  I certainly am.  I've got to stick with us Jews.  Jesus.  Well, he is one of the few.  We're going to turn this thing. 
[01:14:30]  Not many serial killers.  Not many Jewish serial killers.  Not that I can recall.  What about Speck?  We're going to...  Richard Speck, I don't know.  Richard Speck?  I don't know about Joel Rifkin.  Rifkin?  Rifkin might have been the Jewish.  Rifkin?  That's a Jewish name for sure.  Well, you have a long tradition of serial killing, I guess.  I guess we were wrong.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Oh!  I just want one thing to happen to David.  I want to turn him into an alcoholic sex addict.  Wouldn't that be cool? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Hanukkah, oh Hanukkah, come light the menorah.  Definitely.  Definitely.  He just says definitely.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  I made you out of clay.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  I haven't been late.  He hasn't.  Poor bastard.  Look at him looking at sports.  We'll get you, David.  Relax.  He has a very furrowed brow, David.  He's not a bad looking dude.  It is.  It looks like he's concentrating all the time or trying to take a dump.  Yes.  One or the other. 
[01:15:30]  I'm counterfeiting because I'm preparing myself to do this report.  All right.  Listen.  Can I get back to his handwriting, Anthony?  Please.  He prepared for his interview with the boys.  And what are these?  Thought starters or something?  Why are you raising your hand?  What interview are we talking about?  I guess it was your interview to be an intern, right?  No.  I didn't write down anything for it.  What's this?  Is this your handwriting, sir?  That's the first sports report from last week, isn't it?  No, it's not, my friend.  Your raging is against the government.  I believe... 
[01:16:00]  Those are his tips to himself on how to prepare himself.  If I may be honest, I don't know what you're looking at.  What are you looking at?  Well, come over here.  Kenny, show...  Don't let him have it back.  He's grabbing for it.  No.  Is that your handwriting, David?  Uh-oh, now he's smiling.  All right, now bring it back.  He's smiling like he's opening up his...  I was going to say communion.  His bon mitzvah.  I know what that is.  I know what that is.  Yeah, you know what that is.  You do?  What is it? 
[01:16:30]  What is it?  It's not preparing for this interview.  What is it?  It's something from a year ago when I took a class about how to prepare for an interview.  Oh.  And I wrote down notes.  Now, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It wasn't to prepare for this interview.  But it's...  You wrote it as a thing to prepare for an interview.  No.  Not...  All right.  It was a class that I took...  You should be a lawyer.  It was a class that I took that prepared people and taught people how to go on interviews  and how to prepare for a job interview and get a job.  And what was suggestion one? 
[01:17:00]  Burn notes when finished.  That wasn't a suggestion.  Not leave them hanging around.  Look at this guy.  Please.  No.  No.  You're right, Master Poe.  So, I guess the main thing is that you went through the notebook that I brought here is  the main thing.  Master Porum.  And took out some pages that were in my notebook.  That's a true joke.  That would be illegal activity, I do believe.  You let us know who did this and they will be fired, David.  They'll be punished.  They will be fired, David.  Well, you want me to read a few of these in?  Please.  The first one is interview is opportunity to make a connection. 
[01:17:30]  You like that connection thing.  You use that with the girls a lot.  Yeah.  Well, I was just writing down notes about what the person was telling to me in the class.  Yeah.  All right.  What about bragging nicely?  You just wrote bragging nicely.  What's that?  I don't know.  This was a long time ago.  I just kept it in my notebook all this time.  Would it be maybe talking yourself up, but in a way that doesn't seem like you're being  a braggard?  I guess you could say that, yes.  I can say that.  I just did.  Could you give us an example of nice bragging about yourself? 
[01:18:00]  About yourself.  Give us one thing about yourself or a couple of things.  Nicely, though.  Nicely.  Let's see if you learn from this class.  This was such a long time ago.  Well, you still got to have it in your head.  What are some of your good points that you could brag about nicely?  My good points is that I'm looking to get into the broadcasting business.  I'm studying broadcasting.  I hope to make a career in this field.  These are things you want to do.  So these are things you want to do.  We're looking for things, attributes that you have right now that you can tell an employer 
[01:18:30]  like, hey, this is what I have.  Right.  And this is how I could help your company.  Right.  Use the radio show, as a matter of fact.  Not that you're an intern.  Let's say you're interviewing for a job.  What would you tell the company about yourself that would make them go, yeah, this is a guy  we need on board?  Definitely.  I would tell them that I'm very, I pay attention to detail very well, and I'm thorough, I'm  articulate, get the job done. 
[01:19:00]  A go-getter.  Correct.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's what a lot of people have told me in the past, that I pay a lot of close attention  to detail and really do what I'm told.  All right.  That's great.  Attention to detail and do what I'm told.  I just told him that he licked the floor when instructed.  Yeah, right.  We've got to get a dominatrix for this kid.  Listen, keep it relevant, quality, not quantity, say you like what you're doing, okay, this  is what you can depend on me to do. 
[01:19:30]  The best way to emotionally prepare for an interview is practice.  Do you practice for an interview?  Of course you do.  Like what, in front of a mirror or something?  Yeah, sure.  But then you're in a mirror, so you look and go, well, I'm the boss already.  Yeah, because I'm looking at myself, right.  All right, well, it goes on.  Wait, I want to know if you prepared for this.  Did he practice for the interview for the show?  Yeah, did you?  What did you practice saying?  Did I practice for the Opie and Anthony interview you're talking about or just in general?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:20:00]  Of course.  The Opie and Anthony interview.  I didn't really practice, per se.  I mean, if I'm going to be honest, I read up on my, I read up for the interview.  Oh, you did?  Read up meaning reading about the Opie and Anthony, I got familiar with it in case I was  asking some questions about it.  All right, all right.  Yeah, because this is what I also heard from the girls.  That he's trying to pick up behind your back.  He, yeah, that he never listened to the show.  That you didn't, you don't, you didn't know what the show was about or anything until your 
[01:20:30]  first day.  Who said this?  The same girl you were trying to pick up.  The girl you made a connection with.  Yes.  That is not intolerant.  I think she misinterpreted, misinterpreted herself a little bit.  Are you objecting?  I'm objecting to this, this girl, yes.  She asked me, like, she asked me if I had ever listened to the Ron and Fez show.  And I said, no, I've never, I don't, I'm not familiar with it.  What did she ask you?  She asked me if I've ever listened to the Ron and Fez show before.  And I said, no, I'm not familiar with the Ron and Fez show. 
[01:21:00]  I don't know anything about it.  Well, what do you put the Z and the S separate?  Yeah.  The Ron and Fez show.  Most people just drag that in.  In terms of the Opie and Anthony show, I told her that, uh, I listened to the first half  of the show.  Yeah.  Now, the first half of the show that day.  No, the first, in general, the first half of the show.  So, like, in general, like, the first half of the show on K-Rock, I listen often.  Because you don't have Sirius XM.  I don't have Sirius XM, so I can't listen to the second half.  So, what did you learn about the Opie and Anthony show as you prepared for the interview  with Steve?  Well, it was not so much about the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:21:30]  It's about the whole history of Opie and of you guys and your history on radio and stuff.  All right.  What did you learn?  Well, just about your history and how you started out in Boston and about all the different  stunts that you've pulled over the years.  Like what?  Well, not that you started out in Boston, that you were in, that you did have a radio  show in Boston before you came on to New York City and to XM.  And what, and what, uh, what, uh, what stunts did we do?  Um, I learned that you, I learned that you pulled a stunt on, uh, an April Fool's stunt 
[01:22:00]  one day when you were in Boston.  It got a lot of people upset.  What was the stunt?  Uh, the stunt was that you told the citizens of, of Boston on April, uh, Boston, you told  the citizens of Boston on, uh, on April Fool's day that the mayor of Boston was dead, which  was not, which was not correct.  It was an April Fool's joke.  And many people were offended.  What do you think of that?  I thought it's pretty hilarious.  That's a funny joke.  I'm all for that.  It's funny.  One of the girls is saying you're lying.  Ooh.  That you said that, uh, you hadn't, you weren't familiar with the Opie and Anthony show as 
[01:22:30]  far as what we're doing and listening to the program.  It's all right if he isn't.  Just, just be honest.  If you, you didn't really know about us, that's fine.  We're not going to kick you out.  Yeah, no, we're not going to kick me out.  You're gold.  Well, this is, I'm just telling you what happened.  I, she asked me about the Ron and Fez show and I said, no, I'm not.  Ron and Fez show.  Because she's, I asked her who she, what, what's her role with Opie and Anthony?  And she said, I don't work for Opie and Anthony.  I work for the Ron and Fez show.  You familiar with it?  I said, no, I'm not familiar with the Ron and Fez show.  They would tool him with him so bad. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said, what do you, yeah.  I asked her what she does and she said, you don't know who I am?  I said, no.  You don't know who I am.  I said, no, I don't know who you are.  What do you do for Opie and Anthony?  I think that would be part of bragging nicely.  You don't know who I am.  She said, no, I don't do anything for Opie and Anthony.  I work for Ron and Fez show.  First of all, you're, you're talking about Lily.  Yes, that's correct.  But she didn't ask you.  Baby girl asked you.  Well, obviously he was talking to Lily too.  I don't know who baby girl is, but I remember Lily. 
[01:23:30]  That was the, the other girl there.  The other girl that you asked to go out and made a connection with.  That's baby girl?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think her, do you like her?  There was also baby girl.  There was also her baby girl sister was also present.  Right.  The one with the, the one with the notebook shoes.  Okay.  She was wearing sneakers that looked like a notebook.  Wow.  And she was bragging.  She was bragging about her shoes.  Not in a good way.  What was she bragging about?  That, that her shoes looked like a notebook and she thought that was cool.  Cool.  Hard contents at the end of every word. 
[01:24:00]  I liked it a lot.  Yeah.  We're, we're, we're picking up on a lot of things with David.  But anyways, you're saying.  So you want, you want baby girl?  I want her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause you said you made a connection.  You felt like, what kind of connection did you feel you made when you said that?  Come on.  That's hard to say.  I mean, this was the first time that I've met anything, all three of these girls.  Yeah.  I don't know the first thing about them.  But then, but what compelled you to say, I thought we made a connection, like during  such a short period of talking? 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  It wasn't a, it wasn't a serious conversation.  It was kind of like, ha ha, funny, joking around, you know, Kenny was saying, Kenny was  saying one-liners.  Oh, now he's blaming you, Kenny.  I'm not blaming him.  No, I'm just saying that he was telling me one-liners.  He's passing the shekel.  I'm definitely not blaming him at all.  I'm just saying he was passing along one-liners for me to say to them.  We're kind of like joking around, having a good time.  What do you, what do you like about baby girl?  You're attracted to her.  I'm trying to, I'm trying to remember which one is baby girl, which one is Lily, which  one is this?  Which one is baby girl?  The shorter one.  Let's see if the camera's up. 
[01:25:00]  Oh.  You have a picture of her on, on your website?  I just used the one in my head.  All right.  She's not online.  Well, we'll, we'll get to that later.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  Yeah.  And then we got to get to, I haven't even read the kosher sports report yet.  Well, you haven't.  No, I haven't even read it yet.  Thank God you told us.  Yeah, we forgot.  Thank God.  So we're going to take a break.  You stay there with your left hand firmly planted deeply in your pocket. 
[01:25:30]  Okay.  Doing God knows what, because even the Paltok people have realized you're kind of toying  with yourself down there.  Yeah.  You playing pocket pool?  Certainly not.  No.  There's nothing wrong with a little pocket pool?  No, there wouldn't be.  If I was doing it, there wouldn't be.  Okay.  All right.  We got David after the break.  Who the hell did baby girl that she worked for?  David!  No, Lily said that she worked for Ron and Fez.  Oh.  And he's confusing all of them.  Yeah, he's...  Does she, does she not even work for Ron and Fez?  Is that not true?  Who? 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  Lily told me that she worked for Ron and Fez.  She does not work for Ron and Fez.  That's what she told me.  Well, I don't know why she told you that.  She doesn't work for Ron and Fez.  I asked her, what does she do for Opie and Anthony?  She said, I don't work for Opie and Anthony.  I work for the Ron and Fez show.  Ron and Fez show.  Oh, well, I grew up in the city.  I really don't care for it.  I come from a Jewish family, which, of course, you already know.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the back of my hands.  I don't know what they are.  Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.  All right, more with David. 
[01:26:30]  He does kosher sports next.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So we go right back to intern David.  We got to know him a little bit more today, right?  David.  David.  Yes.  Finally, it's time for kosher sports with intern David.  I have to swing out of the way here so the pal talkers can watch David.  David's kind of fun to watch, too.  They're forcing you to wear that shirt again today? 
[01:27:00]  No, they didn't force me at all.  I chose to wear it.  Oh.  Why?  Because it's your thing now?  Yeah, it's a funny shirt.  Whenever I do this kosher sports report, I'm going to wear the shirt.  It's a funny shirt.  Young, dumb, and full of...  Would you prefer I not wear it?  Oh, why don't you just talk over Anthony?  Yeah.  I know.  Apparently Anthony's not important.  You are.  Maybe he doesn't have headphones.  Oh, he does.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  God damn, it's all yours.  It's okay.  I was going to say, would you prefer I not wear the shirt?  We would prefer you nude, but, you know.  What?  Oh, I...  What?  My goodness. 
[01:27:30]  No, it's all right.  What's the protocol for wearing a yarmulke?  Like, why don't you wear it here?  If I'm going to be honest, I very rarely wear a yarmulke.  Get out of here.  I wear it when I go to temple.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Why don't you wear the yarmulke?  Like, some people wear them all the time.  Those are all, like, the orthodox Jews wear them all the time.  I'm not orthodox.  I'm, like, conservative.  Oh, okay.  So you just wear it to temple and stuff and maybe, like, holidays or something?  Yeah, maybe on holidays when we're saying a prayer or something, yeah.  And why can't they figure out how to keep one on without having to put the bobby pins 
[01:28:00]  in?  Because that's kind of...  Or the yarmulke clips.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they're...  I don't know.  They're small and they fall off a lot.  Yeah, they certainly do.  So they wear a clip?  I'm just...  You know something?  I'm going to learn a lot from you about the Jewish culture.  I don't know much about it.  And all my neighbors are Jewish.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I live in a very Jewish neighborhood because I like, you know, they keep the crime away.  They keep their houses nice.  I like that. 
[01:28:30]  Definitely.  Everywhere you move, though, you know, if you move...  When I was renting in the area, oh, my God, did I have to take a hammer at all the mezuzahs  around the doorways and stuff.  Do you have those on your door?  I certainly do have mezuzahs.  Do you rub them every time you go in?  You don't actually necessarily rub it.  You just...  You touch it and you kiss your hand near the finger that you touch.  What is that supposed to do?  It's just like to symbolize that your presence, that you walked in the room.  Yeah, but you know when you see someone walk in the room.  No, because the mezuzah has like the scroll on it.  I know.  I took it out and took a look.  It has a scroll in with the Hebrew writing from the verse from the Bible and it has God's 
[01:29:00]  name on it.  So you're supposed to signify that you touch and you kiss, like you welcome God's presence  as you walk into the next room.  I hit God with a hammer.  Uh-oh.  And then I took the scroll out and I couldn't figure it out.  So you took the scroll out, yeah.  You're not supposed to do that?  Well, I guess it's okay for you.  I mean, you didn't know what was inside.  You wanted to learn.  I believe in Jesus.  So we're worlds apart, my friend.  Definitely.  Wait, mezuzahs, where are they?  All in the house or just on the front door?  All in the house.  No, no, no.  Every room. 
[01:29:30]  Not on the front door.  They're on the side of the door when you enter, like the doorway.  It's a little angled thing.  You ever see this little angled?  Yeah.  It's like a little thing.  And it's a little thing.  And inside it's a little scroll from a specific passage from the Old Testament that has God's  name in it.  And what is the testament?  What does it say, like briefly?  It's just like a one main paragraph that's praising God and acknowledging his presence.  Why pick that to like walk in a doorway to?  Because it's one of the holiest verses in the Bible for Jews. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, it is?  That's one of the holiest verses in the Bible for Jews, yes.  Why every room, though?  Why not just have one?  Well, not every single room.  That's not like the bathroom.  You wouldn't put one on the bathroom.  No, but I've seen one on like bedroom doors.  Yeah, well, if you're super orthodox, you'd have one like every single room in your house.  And isn't it a little unsanitary to touch it and then kiss your fingers?  No, you go like this, like really quickly.  Yeah, but you're touching it.  Because you're touching it because you're kissing.  A lot of other people touching it.  It seems very germy to me.  It's because you're touching, like, you're supposed to be touching the scroll that's in it with God's name. 
[01:30:30]  So you're like kissing God's name to signify that you acknowledge God's presence as you walk into the room,  that he's in that particular, that God is in that particular room.  See, we got the sign of the cross.  It's so much easier.  You just touch your head, your little belly, shoulder to shoulder.  That actually seems more confusing.  You go touching all these things.  You just touch one thing for the Jews.  You just touch one thing real quick.  But how often are you supposed to touch it?  If you're super orthodox and you're ultra-Jewish and you follow the religion really closely,  you're supposed to touch it every single time you walk from one room into another room  that has that mezuzah on the door every single time. 
[01:31:00]  They're everywhere.  Orthodox have it even on the women's thighs.  They have it there where you've got to touch, kiss, and then you've got to know.  See, that's what Catholics thought.  David Anthony was making a joke there.  It was a little joke.  Let's go to Pete in Queens.  Pete.  Yo, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Good.  Pete.  I got a question for the Jew.  If you're bald, right, how do you keep a yarmulke on?  If you're bald, how do you keep a yarmulke on?  Let me explain.  I understand what you mean.  The hair clip doesn't work, the yarmulke clips, and the bobby pin. 
[01:31:30]  So how would a bald man keep that on?  Is there yarmulke glue?  There's no such thing as yarmulke glue.  Not yet.  It hasn't been invented yet.  So what do they do?  What do they do?  How does it not fly off their head?  They walk straight.  That's a good question.  They just try to position the yarmulke in a good place on their head so that it doesn't  fall off.  Do you have one of those big ones or a little one?  They come in different sizes.  And I've seen the kids now to try to get the kids into the religion.  The kids with the yarmulke.  The kids are walking around with the different designs on the yarmulke. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, there's designs on there.  You can have a sports logo.  Yeah, a sports logo on a yarmulke.  You can have your favorite cartoon character on your yarmulke.  That's what I would do.  Back when I was much younger, a lot of the kids used to wear.  The yarmulke that had a Bart Simpson on it.  Bart Simpson.  There's a Bart Simpson.  Like, holy cow, I'm Jewish.  Yeah, exactly.  Say that.  I'm like, holy cow, I'm here.  Yeah.  Or like you would have a Superman logo on a kipas.  I've seen that before.  Juper-man.  Yeah.  What about a bald guy who wears a yarmulke and his whole job is to do somersaults? 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  You mean like a circus performer.  I don't know what I mean.  I understand.  I know exactly what you mean because if he's a somersaulter and he's bald, the yarmulke's  going to keep on falling off every time he's almost.  You don't have to run with this one.  Yeah.  Not a funny bone in this kid's body.  I love him.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Adam.  He saved me, though.  Yeah.  This kid's good.  Adam and Jersey.  He'll pick up a bob and just walk away with this.  Yeah.  Adam.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to elaborate on the whole mezuzah situation. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, good.  Thank you.  All right.  The parking inside the mezuzah says a passage that it means that you should keep your friends  close?  Your enemies closer?  No, not your enemies.  Oh.  You should keep your soul.  It means that God watches over yourself.  Watches over the house.  Watches over you.  So that's the significance of walking into the house and touching the mezuzah. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, basically.  I mean, it's just saying, you know, what's up, God?  You know.  Oh, it's like sup, God.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for that explanation.  It's a what's up, God.  You guys ready for-  It's a little shout out.  Are you ready for kosher sports?  Of course we are.  It's so nice, though, to get to know David a little more each time.  I have a feeling Anthony's taking a liking to this, David.  I'm lighting it up to David.  You like this, David.  You'll all be dead now if it wasn't my David.  Exactly. 
[01:34:00]  And we might have a couple more Ask the Jew.  Ask the Jew.  Well, we got to think-  That's funny.  I like that.  I think his name is David.  And it could just be Ask David.  No, no.  Ask the Jew.  The Jew.  I like the Jew because we learn a lot from the Jew.  I think that's funny, Ask the Jew.  I like that.  Yeah.  Ask the new segment.  Well, Daddy's not going to like it.  Well, it's another thing not to tell Daddy, all right?  Don't tell Daddy what you're doing here.  Tell him you're working at some bank.  Well, he knows what the name of the show is that I'm working for. 
[01:34:30]  He knows that.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  That can't be good.  Oh, and he's an IT guy, so he knows the web.  Oh, boy.  He's probably looked us up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Your father knows how to hide the porn.  You know that, right?  I know.  Wow.  All right.  Let's play Kosher Sports with David.  It's time for Kosher Sports with our host, intern David.  I like this. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, you kids are a killer tune.  Shalom, my brothers.  This is BD Dave with your Kosher Sports Report.  In baseball last night, boy chick Derek Jeter broke Lou Gehrig's record without even getting Lou Gehrig's disease.  Turning to the Mets, they really choked on their matzo balls last night.  Those dumb cops will probably plot their next game also. 
[01:35:30]  In other sports and other baseball news, the Boston Red Sox are in Florida taking on the Tampa Bay Rays.  Mazel tov.  Us Jews love Florida.  Now, in football news, yesterday the Jets dumped their punter.  I like the Jets.  Do you know why?  Because their uniforms are green.  And green is the color of money.  And you know how us Jews love money.  And, speaking of money, in other football news, speaking of money, former New York Giants wide receiver Mark Ingram yesterday was sentenced over seven years in the clink for money laundering and fraud. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, wow.  Yep.  That schmo better be careful not drop his gefilte fish, or he'll get a bone while he atones.  It's got Kenny written all over it. 
[01:36:30]  And finally, for all you golf fans this weekend, the Ryder Cup is starting in Louisville.  You know Louisville, where no Jews live.  But ironically, Jews love to play golf.  And that's today's kosher sports report.  I'm B.D. Dave.  Amen, biatches.  Amen, indeed.  All right, back to Ask the Jets. 
[01:37:00]  Chuck in Maryland.  What's up, Chuck?  Chuck.  We got you.  He wants to know about the sex thing with the sheets.  Where you have to have sex with a sheet in between you.  Oh, the Orthodox Jews follow that.  But do they really follow that?  Yeah, do you know what that's about?  Um, you'll have to ask a really expert Jewish person on that one.  Okay.  I don't know. 
[01:37:30]  I really.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  There he is.  I want to have him read something.  Yeah.  Uh, Chuck.  Yes.  Um, wanted to ask, uh, the Jew if, uh, when he bangs a chick, he's got to do it through a hole in a white sheet.  Yeah, he sort of said he doesn't know.  No.  No.  That's ultra-Orthodox.  That's crazy.  It has something to do with, like, not showing off your body to any, to, like, to anybody.  You're not supposed to show off your body or something.  You seem like a very smart person.  You can do some research.  Two things for the next time you hear. 
[01:38:00]  Research that answer, right?  Research that answer and also research how bald guys, uh, put the, the, the yarmulke.  Yeah.  Well, I think it's just, like, bald guys.  And I think, I don't, I don't think you're, you're, you're correct.  I really do believe they're using some kind of glue product.  You think so?  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  Yeah, it might be yarmulke glue.  Yeah.  Okay, definitely.  All right, but Anthony, uh, is onto something.  Uh, how do you want to handle this?  Uh, well, I think that David should read it because I, I, I think it's, uh, obviously,  I like the fact that you are an Opie and Anthony fan when you applied here.  I think that's what I mean.  A lot of guys aren't.  It is cool.  It's cool that you are.  What is it that you want me to read? 
[01:38:30]  All right, well, uh, first.  Something, uh, someone read, wrote something about me?  No, no, this is you.  This is an exchange, uh, an email exchange between, uh, our own Travis and you.  Um, Travis said, here's what Travis wrote to you.  Uh, Tuesday is good.  We're located at, and then he puts the address in, uh, bring extra copies of your resume.  You will be meeting with Steve and Danny.  If you need to reschedule or have any other questions, let me know, Travis. 
[01:39:00]  Now, uh, you wrote back to Travis.  I know already.  I know the whole story already.  If you could please read, in your own words, what you wrote back to Travis, please, David.  It's right there.  Do I really have to read?  Just read it.  I know what this is already.  You have to read it.  Of course you do, but the audience doesn't.  Yeah.  So please read, uh, your response to Travis's, uh, email.  There you go.  I know, I know what it is already.  Yes, I know we know you know.  Read it.  So the audience now knows. 
[01:39:30]  Just give it a, give it a read.  I know this kid is difficult to work with.  Give it a read.  Don't plow through it.  Yeah.  Read it, uh.  Right.  Uh, I don't want to read.  Do I have to read this?  Yes, yes, you do.  It's part of your internship.  Yes.  Reading on the air.  I'll read it slowly so no one knows.  Okay.  They know what I, what Travis is telling me.  Just read it.  Okay.  Travis.  Tuesday at 1130 works for me.  I will be there at that time for the interview.  I was just wondering, are Steve and Danny the same people as Opie and Anthony? 
[01:40:00]  If they are different, what are their last names and job positions?  Thanks, David Freed.  Now, can I ask you, did Steve and Danny, you thought they could be Opie and Anthony?  I didn't know who Steve and Danny were.  But this also assumes you didn't know who Opie and Anthony were.  If you knew the Opie and Anthony, you would know that our names, my name is Anthony, it 
[01:40:30]  was given to me when I was born.  And his name is Greg.  And his name is Greg, but it's, you know, Opie has been his name since he was a kid,  his nickname.  But his real name is Greg, right.  Yeah, but it's been his nickname.  They called him Opie longer than they've called him Greg.  Right, but even if I, your point is.  But thinking Steve and Danny, if you're familiar, the least bit with the show, you would know  Steve and Danny are not Opie and Anthony.  I know what you're getting at, I know.  You're digging up every possible piece of dirt you could find.  Digging up dirt.  We haven't even begun, Mike.  No, no.  No, you haven't. 
[01:41:00]  You're getting every email that I've written.  Well, this is, this is, this is, which, who did you think he was, Opie or Anthony?  Yeah.  The one walking in.  Yeah.  Who would that be?  That's Steve.  Yeah.  I didn't know who Steve was before I went on the interview.  Well, why would you if you listened to the show?  Yeah.  We only goof on him every day.  All right.  Well, okay.  One more question.  Ask the J.  Adam and Baldwin.  Adam.  Adam. 
[01:41:30]  Adam Baldwin.  Adam.  Adam.  Come on.  You're a non-trange, Ricky.  What's going on?  What do you got, Adam?  Hey.  I wonder what the significance of the strings hanging out of that pocket are.  Oh, the strings.  Yeah.  Hanging out.  Again, another Orthodox Jew question.  All right.  Turn your radio down or shut up.  Please, God.  All right.  Do you know anything about the string?  The string.  It has to do with, like, it has to do with, like, the mitzvahs.  It's like the mitzvahs of the, in the, like, the, in the Bible, something with, like, 
[01:42:00]  the seven mitzvahs.  For, like, the, it's called tzitzis.  There's seven mitzvahs?  Yeah.  Isn't there, like, seven or eight of them?  Like, fringes hanging down?  Yes, can be.  Fringes hanging us?  Oy vey.  That's our answer.  I don't know.  See, that's why you're here to enlighten.  It has to do with, like, you wear, like, ultra-Orthodox wear it, like, underneath their clothes  all the time.  Until they get married, they have to continue wearing it.  And there's supposed to be, like, seven, like, fringes or something.  It has to do with, like, the mitzvahs or the good deeds.  Oh, good deeds.  A mitzvah is a good deed.  Oh, I didn't know that. 
[01:42:30]  See, you've got to explain a little more because, you know, you've got to be a little more specific.  We're really, we don't know much about the Jewish culture.  Wait, so what is bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah?  Bar mitzvah is, like, the coming of age.  What's that got to do with deed?  It's like a good deed.  You're doing the deed, like, you're doing the deed, like, to become a man or a woman  in the Jewish religion.  Right.  Bar mitzvah for a man, bat mitzvah for a girl.  Mm-hmm.  That I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know something.  I had a bar mitzvah.  You did. 
[01:43:00]  Of course I did.  Did you get a lot of cash?  I got a lot of cash.  I did.  What does a good bar mitzvah haul in?  What does that get a kid?  How much cash about?  Uh, could get a couple, could get, like, a couple thousand.  A couple thousand?  Yeah, around 2,000 it could get a kid, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's not bad.  Yeah, for a 13-year-old, yeah.  No, for a 13-year-old, that's pretty good.  What, do you buy a hooker?  Yeah.  Do you?  Not when you're 13.  Well, that's time. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  When you become a man.  This David's a treat.  Now, David, thank you.  So, my goal is to look up the thing about the...  You got three things.  What's the third thing?  The string thing, because I don't know if you got it quite right.  Well, the string thing is the first one.  Bold guy is wearing a kippah.  Yeah.  And the third one is...  A kippah?  What's a kippah?  A kippah is the...  If I may say, a kippah is the Jewish Hebrew word for yarmulke.  Yarmulke is, like, English.  English.  It is?  A kippah is Hebrew.  Oh.  You speak Hebrew at all? 
[01:44:00]  A little.  Give us a little Hebrew.  Shalom.  Manishma.  Oh, okay.  I said, hello, how are you?  Yeah, and that I think we all...  Something more basic.  I mean...  I like David.  Yeah.  He's a keeper.  I can tell.  You're taking a liking to this.  I am, you know?  All right.  You got those three questions answered for the next time you hear.  What's the third one?  It's the sheet.  Oh, the sheet?  That's the big one.  All right.  A lot of people have answers on the line, but I want to hear from you, David.  The sheet, the baldness, and the... 
[01:44:30]  And the string.  The string, okay.  Are the sheets only worn by Jewish Klansmen?  What?  Klansmen?  Klansmen.  Klansmen.  Yes, sure.  Those are clean racists.  All right.  We got to take a break.  David.  Thank you.  David, thank you so much.  It was a treat today.  I'll be back with these answers later on.  Oh, maybe before we get out of here.  Wow.  Look at the tease.  The radio tease.  He knows how to tease.  You want to try to do it before you get out of here today?  Oh, is it today? 
[01:45:00]  Or is it the next time I come in?  Well, it's up to you, David.  Today, because we'll forget.  Yeah, we will forget.  It'll be like a path.  Yeah, definitely.  We have so many bits we start and never end, so maybe we should end this one.  David.  All right.  David.  Before we get out of here, we'll have the answer to those three questions.  Thank you, David.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  This show is flying by today.  Opie and Anthony.  Starring Jim Norton.  Selling out two shows up there in Boston.  What's wrong with you?  Very happy.  Wilbur Theater, huh?  Yeah, November 15th. 
[01:45:30]  November 15th.  On October 3rd, I just want to promote Down and Dirty with Jim Norton.  Starts four episodes, midnight after Bill Maher, October 3rd.  I'll be promoting it a lot as we get closer.  That's awesome.  Yeah, it's a great spot.  He's finally here.  Holy crap.  Jimmy on HBO, October 3rd.  Damn.  Very good.  Famous Jimmy.  877-212-0-a-day.  Why don't we do the old broads one more time because people are just tuning in, Ant.  Yes, it's an important story. 
[01:46:00]  It really is.  We got a lot of clips here.  I don't think we have time to play all the clips, Ant.  So we might as well just kind of throw the story out there.  Three old bags in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.  There used to be a Newbury Comics up there in Shrewsbury.  I want to go a little local today for everybody.  Shrewsbury.  We signed many copies of Demented World at that Newbury Comics in Shrewsbury.  Well, these three old bats, they're up there and apparently they live in this apartment complex. 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  And there's a crabapple tree.  A crabapple tree that these women like.  I guess they put their chairs out there and sit under it.  Boy, they sure do, Ant.  And they're going to cut down this crabapple tree and put a dumpster there.  Yeah.  And it has these three old battle axes all in a tizzy.  So they've decided to sit under the tree in some plastic backyard furniture and tie themselves to the tree with what amounts to knitting yarn. 
[01:47:00]  Wasn't even real.  Like when people do this for a cause, they usually chain themselves to something.  Yeah.  And they climb up in the tree.  Yeah, they climb up.  You could come by with a pair of dull scissors and get these old hags off the tree.  And they're not dedicated to their cause because we got a hold of them this morning and we woke the one old broad up.  She's not even outside.  No.  She's not outside next to the tree.  She's not protecting the crabapple tree.  These dust pooping old fossils are sitting out in front of this tree and they're interviewed by the press. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  And one of them just made a great statement that I think says it all.  It sure sums up everything, Anthony.  It says it all.  That's right.  This is Ethel.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree.  Oh, yeah.  This is the one where she's.  Hey!  Goddamn, Jim. 
[01:48:00]  Linger Lunger.  Stupid Steve.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy ruins everything.  I ruin things.  And the one thing Steve wants more than anything is to be not called stupid.  But then he does what he did earlier and then you can't help yourself.  He's very stressed.  We're not going to explain.  Steve had quite the faux pas earlier.  All right.  Now I got to start the clip again.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree. 
[01:48:30]  And I can't see why they can't fix the dumpster and why they can't fix the pad.  I mean, I'd like to know them to tell me why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad.  I'm sure if I was young, I could fix it.  It's not about the cement pad, lady.  That's a Boston accent mixed in with something else.  Is she from across the pond originally or something? 
[01:49:00]  Well, they do use certain words over there a lot.  Yeah.  So perhaps she is.  I don't know.  But wow.  Yeah.  And we're trying to get it.  We're very close to getting Ethel on our show.  Very close.  Yeah.  So hopefully we'll have her on in a few minutes here.  Hopefully Steve won't screw that one up.  No.  And it reminds us of the.  And when you're on, don't say can't.  Yes.  That's what I'll tell her. 
[01:49:30]  Whatever you do.  It reminds us of the crying tree people.  We got to play this one more time.  Crying tree people.  Oh, good.  Earth First members cry over dead trees.  Yeah.  They went in the middle of the woods.  They found some tree that was laying on the ground and start talking about it, talking to it, getting all choked up about it.  Oh, kind of like when you were a kid and you found your dog dead in the yard, you would talk to it and cry over and all that, right? 
[01:50:00]  No.  But they're doing the same thing with a tree.  When I found little Smokey on the side of the road, Opie, I just ran away because Smokey looked, Smokey was dead.  My father told me Smokey ran away and he had just seen Smokey.  He was lying because I was walking home and right there on the side of the road was a cat that looked like Smokey.  And I was like, uh-oh.  So, and then I ran up to see if Smokey was okay and I looked and I took a stick and I turned Smokey over because the side that was facing me looked like Smokey. 
[01:50:30]  So, I went to turn Smokey over and Smokey turned over and Smokey was completely flat on the other side.  Could have been a wall mounting and full of maggots eating away at little Smokey.  And I saw Smokey's skeleton and it was, it just, it disturbed me so much that I just, of course, burst into tears and started crying because that's what I did. 
[01:51:00]  You were 17?  Yes.  A little Smokey.  Well, Smokey sucked.  Dad lied to me.  I hate Smokey.  Well, here's adults crying over dead trees.  And Smokey was a douche.  Deep in the woods of North Carolina, an extremist eco-group called Earth First, the whales in violation of American nature.  I want to mourn the loss of all the old growth trees I've seen. 
[01:51:30]  And tell them that we love them and that we don't want them to die, that there are some people here who do care.  So, I want you to know that, trees, that we care.  You might want to take notice that trees don't have ears. 
[01:52:00]  Yes, they...  You dummy.  They really, they can't hear you.  Right.  They don't care about you.  They're just there.  And when they fall down and die, they, what do you think?  The little tree spirit goes somewhere?  Same as people.  You're just, you're done.  I don't think God gave the spirit to the trees.  No.  And no... 
[01:52:30]  Only the Simeon has the divine Spock.  Right.  And no, no, no spirit for animals either.  Just the humans, right, Ant?  Yep.  That's it.  Just doled it out to us people.  That's right.  We know best.  I think we are deeply hurting in America.  I think we are deeply craving answers.  I think that we've lost our identity as we have evolved into technology and into industrialized society.  Are we for it? 
[01:53:00]  Bring me to this cathedral.  Bring me to those guys.  Bring me to this rock that has the most incredible life.  That makes me feel alive.  I've looked at clear cuts in Burnt Forest and I've felt outraged, but I didn't scream and  I didn't cry.  And I need to.  Ah!  I wish that scream was because a giant tree, they just saw it falling on them. 
[01:53:30]  And that was their final scream before a giant tree crushes them.  No, it was a tree attacking like in the evil dead.  Legs being opened in a branch.  That was a good scene.  That was great.  Oh my God.  Yeah, let's thank Lord of the Rings.  Very good, E-Rock.  We got Lord of the Rings fans out there.  Yeah.  There are some really effed up people out there because that is just beyond any reason. 
[01:54:00]  Bunch of kooks.  Nuts.  In the middle of the woods crying over dead trees.  And they get to vote for the president.  That's the weird thing.  Well, you know who they're voting for.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  A tree.  Yeah.  Third party candidate.  The Oak.  The Oak.  Larry Elm.  Right.  Larry Elm and his running mate, Mr. Oak.  Dummies.  Yeah, Steve Moss.  Or Pete Moss.  God, I suck. 
[01:54:30]  Let's put down a little Steve Moss.  Hello, I'm Moss.  Exactly.  Yes, I am because I just kind of stay there and don't move.  Why?  Hey, we almost didn't do our jobs today.  I just realized.  What?  This thing has been sitting in front of us and we almost didn't play this.  What an empty CD case? 
[01:55:00]  Why, Opie?  What is it?  The smallest man meeting the...  Oh, yeah.  This is the story.  That's the story.  It might even be better than the old broads with the crab apple tree.  I doubt it unless they say something really funny.  Oh, and I am keeping track.  Two days in a row, using the word battle axe.  Oh, yeah.  I kind of like battle axe.  We got to work that in every day for a while.  Yeah, for a little while.  Did you see the photo of them together?  Yes, that's what I'm getting at.  Oh, my God.  Let's play the story and then we'll explain the photo.  Yeah.  I took a picture of it.  It's up on onaradio.com.  This is every news.  Every news station is covering this story because it's like the feel good kind of, oh, look 
[01:55:30]  at this story.  Yeah.  Well, the shortest man in the world comes face to knee with a woman who has the longest  legs on earth.  Ping Ping from China.  Those awesome long legs.  Yeah, it's Al Pacino under this lady.  Go on for days, Turk.  He's standing between her legs, right?  Well, they say face to knee. 
[01:56:00]  I say face to can't.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Why don't you drop a little wig glue on my head?  I got to nail my yarmulke to my head.  I haven't done Pacino in a few days and it's showing.  It feels good.  It feels good.  Knee with a woman who has the longest legs on earth.  Ping Ping from China is just two foot five.  And Svetlana Pacino from Russia is six foot seven with four foot four legs. 
[01:56:30]  You see the photo of them together?  He looks like she had a miscarriage.  Yes.  Look.  Look at the picture.  It's like she just dropped them right out there on the sidewalk.  They did that on purpose.  Of course.  Yeah.  The little fella's right under her.  You know what.  Wearing traditional.  What is that?  Chinese.  Chinese baby wearer, I guess.  Little costume baby clothes.  I don't know what it is.  She's sexy, man.  You like that?  Oh, come on, Jimmy. 
[01:57:00]  Look at the boobs.  There's no boobs there.  She's a monster.  Would you like that?  She's sexy about the legs.  There's that episode of Seinfeld where George wants to have sex with a giant woman.  Yeah.  She'd be perfect.  She needs implants or something because her boobs can't possibly be big enough to compensate  for the body.  She's got very long legs is what it is.  And that's what her record is, I guess.  She's got four foot.  52.  4'4".  4'4".  I believe, yeah.  Wow.  Four legs.  It would be a freaky thing. 
[01:57:30]  The pair posed four photographers in London yesterday to promote their entries into the  Guinness Book of World Records.  Take a look at that picture.  Wow.  That is wild.  Yeah.  These guys.  Yeah.  These guys.  You talking about Steve having no improv skills?  That's wild.  You can't make a joke out of this?  Yeah.  Look at that guy.  No, they probably can't.  Look at the dumb little shoes they got that little thing wearing.  I know.  They dressed it up like a stupid little thing. 
[01:58:00]  Little curl shoes.  Little curly shoes.  It's wearing a little blue robe thing.  Yellow pants.  Yellow pants.  Green shoes.  It's a little mess.  Look at her big dumb ankles.  Oh, God.  Giraffe ankles.  Stupid big whore in a little walking key chain.  Wow.  That is wild.  Yeah.  Okay.  And like Linda said, where does she get her stockings? 
[01:58:30]  You've got to be special made.  That's the first thing I thought when I saw that picture.  I did.  Really.  See, the dude wants to make the can't joke.  Walking key chain.  Oof.  Oof.  Pew.  On crack.  Yeah.  Looks like a key chain, Turk.  Put your keys on them.  Open the door. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Well, the key to happiness is revitalizing Soho.  Tribeca.  Yes.  It's my home.  Triangle below canal.  And as you see in Raging Bull, I'll ring your bell.  You stink.  Idiot.  Blithering dolts.  I love it.  It's completely unexpected.  Expected. 
[01:59:30]  Yes.  Totally expected.  Nice interview, Dick.  Yeah.  Turk and Rooster.  Turk and Rooster.  I can't wait to see the.  CokeLogic animation.  CokeLogic animation.  No.  Have you?  The movie, I mean.  No.  No.  I'm waiting for a cable to pick it up tomorrow.  You didn't see the movie like every other American.  Going to go out and instead I'm going to buy a Chinese key chain. 
[02:00:00]  She should just drop a loaf on them.  What a weird looking little thing that is, though.  Like it doesn't even look like just a little person.  There's something wrong with that thing.  It looks like you might have that.  Like primordial dwarf.  Primordial dwarf thing going on.  I bet you that's what's happening.  It's not cute.  No.  It's freakish.  They should play like ga-gunk ga-gunk music whenever he walks anywhere.  Ga-gunk ga-gunk.  Yeah, ga-gunk ga-gunk ga-gunk.  Oh, the.  Pop was the weasel. 
[02:00:30]  Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.  Those scared me.  Yeah.  Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink,  scared.  Another thing that made you cry.  Oh, Jack in the Box has made me cry so bad.  Stupid Jack stealing my girlfriend.  Huh?  Nothing.  That was a little joke.  Very little.  I did actually hear you're actually making a great point.  What?  He's sitting under her legs and the top of his hair is red. 
[02:01:00]  It really is.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  Looks like that.  Yeah.  Looks like Svetlana made the little fella a hat.  Oh, that's my cranky hat.  I'm sorry.  She should make it.  A little seagull comes and flies off with him.  He thinks he's a trout.  Yeah.  Wait, bird.  That's not a discarded piece of trash.  That's a man.  He just smells that way.  Help me.  Help me. 
[02:01:30]  She should try to make it snow on the little fella's head.  Ooh.  A little.  All I want to do is bully him.  I know.  Wouldn't it be fun to push him down and watch him fall on his little hiney?  I want to poke his chest really hard and just watch him tumble backwards.  It's not cute.  No.  It's not cute.  It looks...  I can beat the crap out of him.  Oh.  That'd be fun.  What if you know some of that kung fu?  Oh, stop. 
[02:02:00]  Look.  Please.  Why do we want to hurt it?  I want to hurt it.  I want to see him fall on his little hiney.  I want to see him fall down those stairs.  Fall on his little hiney.  His little legs would go straight out and his feet would be sticking straight up and he'd  just go, boonk, like a baby falls on its little hiney.  Iroch, you're whispering.  Use the microphone.  Iroch.  Microphone.  Iroch.  What's up?  Ogie boy.  I was just saying, he was talking about the bird.  I heard I found something.  Well, go ahead and play it. 
[02:02:30]  There you go.  Wow.  All right.  Well.  Thanks, Iroch.  It was that bit.  Yes, it is.  An hour a hour.  Well, well.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York City.  Mikey.  Hey, morning, boys.  Just going to say the little shrunken head guy from Beetlejuice aged pretty well.  All right.  It was going so well, too.  The count.  Iroch, thanks.  Now two strikes.  I want to see his little shoes again.  Yeah.  Let me see his little, oh, God, look at those stupid things.  Little booties.  I want to stand on the tips of him and then push him over so he pops right back up. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, and you can push him and punch him again.  Yeah.  I want to pick him up by the ankles and beat Svetlana with him.  Yeah, like at the end of The Wanderers when Perry's father was swinging one ducky boy into  another.  Why don't you get your mother a little something?  A drunk mom.  Oh, that wasn't Perry's father.  Yeah, it was the other guy.  Joey, I think. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What is that thing?  What's wrong with it?  The parents were probably killed.  I bet.  After they saw that, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure the government came up, killed the parents, took it and dressed it like that  and put it in some kind of freak show.  Put her a woman in the museum of science.  Museum of ick.  Hey, we're going to start a bit.  We're going to get to it tomorrow, big time.  But remember when we were talking about Michael Phelps doing the SNL thing?  And we were talking about how athletes shouldn't be acting and all that crap. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  They're really good at doing their sport.  But when it comes to acting, you know.  And then we did the Cal Ripken water heater thing.  Yeah.  All excited about hotter showers or something.  E-Rock has been putting together a bunch of athletes attempting the acting thing.  Oh.  And we start with a guy named Carlson Palmer.  Cincinnati Bengals, huh?  Carlson Palmer.  What?  Carlson Palmer.  Oh, Carlson.  Okay.  I don't know this guy.  I'm sorry.  Carlson Palmer.  He's a quarterback.  Doing a sausage commercial. 
[02:04:30]  Uh-huh.  Sausages.  Who's ready for a smoked sausage?  Look, it's Carson Palmer.  Don't come up short this grilling season.  Go long.  Can we get a measurement over here?  John Morrell's new Bickett and the Bun Smoked Sausages are a full inch longer than the competition.  It's gone.  It's a love band.  Ugh.  They gotta have the tie-in.  Every one of these has that stupid tie-in.  Who is he?  He's a quarterback.  He's a quarterback for the... 
[02:05:00]  He's a big deal for the Bengals, but...  For the...  He's talking about sausage.  Sausages.  Yeah.  He needs bigger sausages.  Why would you agree to that as a man?  He loves them big.  That's the worst commercial I've ever heard.  I like a sausage.  It makes me gag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like someone to grab a sausage and slap my face with it.  We meet Kobe Armstrong doing a motor sales commercial.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Here are your keys, Mr. Armstrong.  Right on.  Kobe, what are you doing here? 
[02:05:30]  I'm here to pick up my new BMW.  A&L really took good care of me because of, you know, who I am.  Oh, Jesus.  You?  Who are you?  I thought they only took care of superstars.  I hope you saw that.  Like me.  Hey, guys.  They treat everybody like a superstar.  That's why I have one of you.  Yeah.  Take a jack.  A&L Motor Sales, serving Pittsburgh for 60 years.  And you pay these guys a lot of money.  You shouldn't be able to say, look, it sucks.  Do it again and again and again. 
[02:06:00]  He's terrible.  I was just distracted because they were showing a clip from Lost when this chick gets shot in the chest.  And I was wondering if Jimmy had seen that yet because I know he was catching up on Lost.  Yeah.  Because you look like, oh, my God, she gets shot.  No, it's cool.  Another spoiler.  I love when they put spoilers just out of nowhere like that.  Yeah.  You want to try a John Elway acting job here?  Oh, I'm sure this is good.  Big dumb teeth.  Hi, I'm John Elway, and I want to talk to you about my WYSIWYG.  Oh, whoa, John, you can't talk about your WYSIWYG on TV. 
[02:06:30]  Why not?  Sensors will go crazy.  WYSIWYG.  WYSIWYG is?  My WYSIWYG.  I wear it when I WYSI.  People think it's my hat, but it's really my WYSIWYG.  A WYSIWYG?  What is this?  I don't know.  Let's try to find it.  Already, by the way, this commercial is, it already makes the sausage commercial look  good.  Look like Citizen Kane.  This is horrendous.  What don't you like about this one? 
[02:07:00]  A, the WYSIWYG, the adorableness that they're both reveling in the cuteness of it, and I  hate the way it's...  The excitement.  Hey, hey.  The censors.  Stop it.  We know you're talking about your...  Hi, I'm John Elway, and I want to talk to you about my WYSIWYG.  Oh, John, you can't talk about your WYSIWYG on TV.  Why not?  Censors will go crazy.  You even know what a WYSIWYG is?  A WYSIWYG, yeah.  WYSIWYG.  Uh, what is a WYSIWYG?  With John Elway's one, low no haggle price, what you see is what you get. 
[02:07:30]  WYSIWYG.  It's your price.  It's your price.  It's everyone's price.  Yeah, that WYSIWYG.  Please have a call.  John Elway.  Oh, look.  I just got goosebumps.  Yeah.  Dude, I just got goosebumps from that, from the chills of the douche variety.  Yuck.  Wow.  Yuck.  Wow.  John Elway.  For the people that linger longer, too, you missed the Steve Why Not. 
[02:08:00]  Why Not.  There was a Why Not in the middle of that.  Why Not.  That's, can we hear the end of that again, please?  Uh, apparently, Denver Pest is saying he sold the dealerships and lost millions.  Oh, really?  Did he?  Why'd he lose millions?  Uh, I guess he, uh, sold it for less than he bought them for.  I, I shouldn't have asked that question.  It can't.  WYSIWYG.  Uh, what is a WYSIWYG?  With John Elway's one, low no haggle price, what you see is what you get.  WYSIWYG.  It's your price.  It's their price. 
[02:08:30]  It's everyone's price.  Yeah, that WYSIWYG.  Please have a call.  I don't get the WYSIWYG part.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on before anyone says anything.  And now I know the answer, but...  What you see is what you get.  What is a WYSIWY...  Oh.  What is it, though?  It's, it's an acronym.  For, for what you see is what you get.  WYSIWYG.  I get it now.  I had to see it in print.  Why is there a G, I at the end, though? 
[02:09:00]  No, that's an exclamation point.  WYSIWYG!  WYSIWYG!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'm four foot three, and I'm five nine once I put on my WYSIWYG.  Makes me taller.  Those are WYSI shoes.  Yeah.  Hey, Turk.  Yes, Rusta.  Rusta.  I'll break your head.  Way to do it.  One, one mentality and one emotion through the whole movie, Bob.  That's good. 
[02:09:30]  That's good.  They're going at it again.  Same, you know, pitch again.  Yeah.  Let it go, guys.  No.  Rusta.  Rusta.  And it has to get racist every time.  Someone saw the commercial, and they're calling John Elway's partner in the commercial a very,  very nasty thing.  Are they calling him a WYSIWYG?  Yes.  Always.  What's wrong with you people?  Okay.  Come on.  You've got to give them credit. 
[02:10:00]  What's wrong with you people?  You've got to give them credit.  And there's too many people coming up with that to give anyone credit.  Oh, that's fantastic.  And WYSIWYG.  You're a racist.  Do you want to do one more?  Oh, please.  This is out of Boston.  Boston Red Sox.  Jonathan.  Oh, boy.  Papelbon.  Papelbon.  No, Papelbon.  Jonathan Papelbon.  All right.  Papelbon.  This isn't Bishop County High School Baseball. 
[02:10:30]  You're in the game.  Give me a minute, coach.  I'm buying a vehicle at 125auto.com.  Oh, I found it.  Oh, my God.  Worst ever.  Wow.  This guy is so incredibly bad.  I'm glad we're finally doing this bit.  Wow, this is bad.  Why wouldn't the owner of the company say, look, I'm not happy.  I don't give a crap he's a boss to Red Sox.  This stinks.  I'm buying a vehicle at 125auto.com.  Boss is Olivier compared to this guy. 
[02:11:00]  Click, send, done.  No, just the opposite.  Now coming into action in 2004 125 Auto Hover is Jonathan Papelbon.  Keep the engine running.  This won't take long.  Just call us.  The Megastore.  Oh, he is bad.  He is horrid.  He's mumbling through the website, the web address.  There's a once in a while going to come.  Wow.  And then he did another one about his last name.  He did another one about Hummers. 
[02:11:30]  Did he?  Right now, I'm going to have Bell's palsy.  Jonathan Papelbon.  Mr. Papelbon, what's the best thing about pitching in Beantown?  Come to the park in my Hummer for 125 Auto.  Can you believe I've hit under 39 grand?  Doesn't it give you chills when you're walking the ballpark?  Yes.  It gives me chills driving to the park in my Hummer from the Megastore.  My teammates can't believe the incredible deal I got.  John, you pitch for the greatest team in baseball.  Yeah, but I also pitch for the best dealership in New England.  The 125 Megastore.  You can't beat their selection and the prices will blow you away. 
[02:12:00]  Just call us.  The Megastore.  You got to open your mouth wider, son.  What are you doing?  You got to talk loud.  Articulate.  Say it so they can understand it.  The 125 Megastore.  I remember that.  And I pitched for the best team in the everest pitching.  And that was the good stuff.  Yeah, that was the stuff that they went with. 
[02:12:30]  How many takes was that?  Oh, I could only imagine.  Maybe they agreed to do this, but they say one take because I'm too busy.  Well, a baseball player would sound like an idiot.  Yeah.  Perfect, right?  Perfect.  Cut, print, perfect.  Let's move on.  Yeah.  We got more of him for tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  Tomorrow we'll have a bunch more.  Of Papal Bond.  And others.  He's great.  That sucks.  The show's over.  Well.  Well, half of it.  No.  We go over. 
[02:13:00]  Three-fifths.  Three-fifths of it are done.  Yeah.  Two more hours of uncensored potty mouth talk.  Hijinks that are blue.  And Lisa Sparks is going to be over there, the foreign girl who we like a lot.  Oh!  I'm hoping her giant bosoms will meander their way into the face of an unnamed young Jewish  instrument.  Oh.  Get David real fast.  David!  Aw.  When are we getting the answers to our questions? 
[02:13:30]  Oh.  What happened?  Where's my David?  David!  Get on, Mike.  What happened?  You've got to make it fast.  David, hurry.  David, what happened?  What happened about what?  You're supposed to get the answer to those Jew questions.  Oh, the answer is you want them right now?  Yes.  Well, no.  No?  But he's supposed to have them.  You didn't say right now.  I know the answer.  I mean, they're very simple.  No.  We said by the end of the show.  But now the show's over.  And I'm wondering why you didn't come in here with the answers.  Well, what about the next show? 
[02:14:00]  What about when we switch over to XM?  No.  We've got other plans for you over there.  Have you ever seen boobies?  Yes.  Big boobies?  Live, not pictures.  In person?  In person?  Yes.  Yes?  Where?  Where?  Oh, I'm in a different club.  Oh, like at a topless joint?  Yeah, correct.  Script club?  Correct.  Oh, this guy, he's all right.  You have a giant mac mush in your face?  We can't say the answers over at XM to the Jewish questions? 
[02:14:30]  Enough about the Jewish questions.  No, because they want the answers over here.  Because a lot of this audience doesn't go over there.  No, they're selfish.  Selfish.  Yeah.  What about on Friday when I come back?  We can answer them.  All right, producer.  All right, Friday.  Wow.  What about Friday?  She.  This kid hangs out in strip clubs.  Good boy.  Good boy.  We're going to have fun with some boobies in you today, all right?  Live or just picture or video?  Yeah, we're bringing a dead girl in.  I don't know.  The rest of the day is severed by an angry mortician.  I don't know.  It could be on a video.  Could be.  If you enjoy David, you've got to pick up his reaction to two girls, one cup. 
[02:15:00]  It's on YouTube.  I don't know how you find it.  I don't know what the search is right now.  We couldn't link it on onaradio.com?  I don't know.  Why not?  Down in Washington.  Just let us do the show.  We're not showing the actual video.  I think we can do that.  Well, link that to onaradio.com.  His reaction to two girls, one cup was really, really good.  Loved it.  Really, really good.  You'll get some hits today there, Stump Brain.  Get it up there.  See you guys tomorrow. 
[02:15:30]  Bye.  Man, that Sarah Palin is getting hotter and hotter, man.  I think she's got Hollywood makeup artists following her around now.  They're gussying her up a little.  They've got that shiny makeup on her face.  She definitely was a hottie.  A hottie.  But now, I don't know, man.  She's looking better and better every day, right?  They probably have her on Weight Watchers or something.  Lose a few pounds.  We've got a makeup artist that's going to follow you around.  I hear she's got quite the wardrobe, too.  She's wearing $2,500 dresses and stuff. 
[02:16:00]  That's why these broads that they're trying to get the vote from,  they notice when other broads wear the same clothes twice.  Yeah.  So they've got to watch themselves.  They'll be like, oh, boy, look at her.  She doesn't even have fashion sense.  How could she run a country?  Looking hotter, but her DNA still stinks.  Well, I don't know that.  Hey, see, the reason why that was funny this morning  is because the lady was saying what sounded like cunt. 
[02:16:30]  Oh.  Oh, shit, I was just thinking it was funny  because she was saying that the tree shouldn't be cut down.  Yeah, what do you mean?  Oh.  Yeah, see, the real reason is because she's trying to say can't,  but it came out cunt.  I can't.  Did it?  Yeah.  I didn't even notice.  I needed to explain that to you because you were confused all morning.  Wow.  I was so confused all morning about that.  You didn't understand the obsession with the old battle axe  and their dumb crab apple tree. 
[02:17:00]  Stupid crab apple tree cunt saying lady.  There you go.  And the other thing, I got to apologize to Anthony because, uh,  what is this?  Charles?  What is that statue?  Why are they doing it?  What's the statue on the beach?  I don't know.  Oh, never mind.  Sorry.  It's Charlton Heston saying, you blew it up.  It looked kind of like the Statue of Liberty in the sand,  but it was a different type of statue.  Yeah, there's some somewhere outside Galveston.  Yeah, they're showing some, uh, hurricane damage from Ike.  Yeah, whatever.  You choose to live there. 
[02:17:30]  Deal with it.  That's what I say.  Who gives a fuck?  So build your house every few years.  Um, Anthony, I apologize for the crop dusting.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  And the Philly crew not happy with me that I stole their crop dusting,  uh, term and, uh, didn't give them any credit.  So there you go.  I got crop dusting from them.  But I, I have a, uh, a low lying chair and, uh,  I didn't want to soil my jeans because we have a big little,  uh, get together after the show today, a little meeting.  So I kind of raised my, uh, my jeans off the seat a little 
[02:18:00]  and just crop dusted in your direction.  Yeah.  You sprayed like a skunk, like a scared skunk.  You know what?  I'm pretty happy though, because all morning long, that wasn't farts, my friend.  That was, uh, that was mud.  It was a muddy morning for the opester.  A muddy morning for the opester.  That's fucking funny.  You just, you love shitting.  I, you know what? 
[02:18:30]  It's these stupid hours that somehow, some way we got to get out of eventually.  Because, uh, I, I never even noticed my shit until we started doing morning radio.  Never noticed.  I would just do it like anyone else and not even talk about it, think about nothing.  Sure.  But the, these hours, man, they, it binds you up and, and then it decides to release.  Finally on a Saturday you get eight dumps in when you should be dumping every day.  And then sometimes it comes out like spray and mud and just a pain in the ass. 
[02:19:00]  Literally.  It's the hours, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, um, are we ready?  Is it soundproof?  We're going to attempt something here.  In the other room, cutting IDs and helping Derek with some light.  All right.  We got Lisa Sparks.  I told him he's in a soundproof room because.  Yeah.  You didn't tell him she does porn.  Did we, did we say it over there?  No, we did.  We said something about her big tits, but we didn't say.  Jim, you said Lisa Sparks is coming in and she, I don't know if you alluded to it or not.  It doesn't matter.  We're going to say she's just a listener.  Um, and what Lisa's going to do, I told her like, she's not going to tell David she's 
[02:19:30]  in porn.  She's going to sit, which is a very short little skirt on.  And, uh, she took her panties off.  So she's going to kind of flash him.  Like while they're talking.  Yeah.  Just show her pussy a little bit.  And we're going to try to get David to talk to her.  And whatever, I think that Anthony should indicate to the audience, whenever we catch him,  A, looking up her skirt.  Yes.  Um.  Or staring at her big pants.  Yeah, I mean, she does have big, beautiful tits.  Give her a little.  Yeah, whenever we catch him doing that, um, is there anything else we could get him to 
[02:20:00]  do?  Like.  Yeah, we got other things.  But we can tell.  After the big reveal, we got some other things we can do.  No, no, no.  I mean, like before we reveal.  Is there anything else that we can indicate to the audience?  Like.  Hmm.  No, it'll be obvious.  Okay.  When Ant rings the bell that he's just staring at her big tits and her can't.  Let's bring her in.  Let's just cross body block him so his face falls right in our pussy.  Let's bring her in and just talk to her before.  Her can't.  We're going to bring her in before. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  Here's Lisa.  She looks really good.  Jesus.  Lisa, before I get to you, I just got to apologize because it's all about apologies these days  on radio.  You know that dumb statue I was just making fun of in Galveston, Texas?  Uh-oh.  What was it?  Well, the locals there had such a horrific hurricane back at the turn of the century,  I believe, somewhere around 1908, 1910, somewhere around there.  Lost a lot of people.  Lost pretty much the entire community a hurricane back in the day.  And I guess that's.  That they decided to make a statue to kind of honor those people that died in that hurricane 
[02:21:00]  almost a century ago.  So, I'm an idiot.  A century ago?  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I'm an idiot.  It was about them.  Oh, Lisa, I don't know why your mic would be on.  I know, man.  Might be mine.  Why would it be?  Let me see if it's my fault today.  Wow.  Okay.  I'll talk.  Okay.  I don't know why you're apologizing to me about the statue, though.  But thanks.  No, not you.  Not you, you dummy.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Let me see how it looks.  I was just checking.  I feel like I should be like the basic instinct chick.  Come on.  Oh, wait.  Why would that mic work, Jimmy? 
[02:21:30]  You're not going to touch it?  You're not going to indicate at all that he can see your pussy?  I got it.  Can you lean back a little bit?  I want to see how it looks.  Like, say he's talking to you.  How would you continually do it?  Like, if he's talking to you.  He's kind of like, mm-hmm.  Yeah, just see if you can.  Just make sure you open it so you can see the lips, though.  I'm being really a pervert.  I know.  He's like, hold on.  Just be like, what?  No.  No, she has a nice pussy.  I shaved this morning just for you.  Fucking sexy, man.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, you know panties?  No.  I took them off.  He told me to take them off, so I said, okay.  Well, if he tells you to take them off, then that's what I do. 
[02:22:00]  Isn't she terrific?  I'm a trooper.  What are you promoting while you're here?  Just before you bring me.  Just me.  I don't know.  Oh, she's just hanging.  Can we make panty tea today?  What?  What?  Panty tea.  Panty tea.  What is that?  We get a little hot water.  We dip the panties a few times.  The crotch.  You just dip the crotch in the ass of the panties.  But my crotch is clean, so I don't know if you'd get anything.  Even a clean one's got to leave a little something.  You like that, Jim?  Her vagina is so nice.  You like that?  Yeah, it's plump and sexy, shaved. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Freshly today.  Freshly today.  Some people are saying you did tell Dave she's a porn star.  If I did, it's my fault.  All right, we'll figure something out.  Let's bring in David.  Intern David.  We want him to interview her.  Yes.  We want him to talk.  Yes.  David?  He's a very naive Jewish.  Oh, a Jew.  David!  Is he really?  Do we know that?  David!  Where is he?  David!  Oh, that's right.  We learned that last time.  David!  Where is he?  I'm calling him.  David!  You'll be dead now if it wasn't my David.  David? 
[02:23:00]  That's the best clip.  My, my, my, my, my, David.  David!  David!  Oh, here he is.  Where do I go?  Over there.  Where do I go?  If that's all right with you.  In the big boy chair.  Look at that.  David, this is one of our fine listeners, Lisa.  Hello.  Hello.  And we want you to interview her.  Okay.  He's like, all right, I got it, I got it.  We want to see what your interviewing skills are.  You know, what kind of chops you have.  Make sure your headphones are working, you little sweet man. 
[02:23:30]  Hello.  Okay.  All right, why won't you look at her?  What are you, is your headphones not working?  What are you, turn the volume up.  Yeah.  He's like, I can't hear you.  That magic.  There I go.  There I go.  Now.  What are you doing?  You're panicking.  You're falling apart.  Panicky Pete.  How is that?  Hello, hello, hello.  He can't hear himself.  Are you doing your headphones?  No.  No.  Not really.  Mars is on the, uh.  Okay.  I'll have a plug.  Hello, hello, hello, hello. 
[02:24:00]  A little bit, a little.  That's a good thing to do on the radio.  Just hello, hello, test, test, check, one, two.  There I go.  Now I got it.  Ah.  So when you see a volume button, why would you turn the volume a little and go, no, and  then not turn a little more?  I don't know.  Dave, you're having a tough time looking at Lisa.  Why?  I don't know.  Are you angry at her?  I don't know her.  I know, I'm mad.  I don't know who she is.  I never met her.  All right, well, why don't you ask her a few questions and get to know her a little  bit.  What are we interviewing?  Because she's a listener and she's up here and it's like, we always talk to the listeners 
[02:24:30]  and we never give, we get complaints that we never give the on, like a lot of the staff  time to talk to them, so.  Yeah.  That's right.  So.  Okay.  Yeah.  Go for it.  Shoot.  I'm all yours.  Okay.  Just get there.  What's your name?  My name's Lisa.  Hi, Lisa.  Where are you from?  I live in Kentucky.  Kentucky.  What are you doing in New York?  I have friends here and I'm visiting. 
[02:25:00]  I listen to the show.  I'm a visitor.  Oh, that's great.  Where in New York are you staying?  Over near Times Square, you know, where all the fun stuff happens.  Oh, do you like Times Square?  I do.  It's fantastic.  What do you like about it?  It's all the pretty lights.  Definitely.  They're very pretty, aren't they?  Absolutely.  You're a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  Absolutely.  Do you listen every day?  Not every day.  But every morning.  Yeah.  I try.  I gotcha.  I do my best.  It's an interrogation. 
[02:25:30]  So, what do you do for a living?  I run websites.  I'm a webmaster.  Oh.  I'm a geeky.  I'm a computer geek.  What kind of websites are these?  All different kinds.  I've made a ton.  And you mean you get contracted by the companies to make websites for them?  Absolutely.  I'm a nerd.  I know.  What makes you so experienced in website making?  I've done it for a year.  Did you study, like, computer science in school?  Uh, no.  Actually, communications.  But same difference.  So, how did you get experience? 
[02:26:00]  Like, when did you make your first website?  Ah, wow.  1999.  Oh, and what was that a website of?  Do you remember your first website?  I do.  It was a picture one.  It had pictures on it.  Was it for a certain company or just on your own?  Just on my own.  Okay.  That's good to know.  How long are you going to be in New York City for?  I leave on Friday.  Friday?  Just a couple days.  Nice little short trip.  Oh, are you upset to go back home?  No.  I'm ready to go.  No?  No, because I like my house.  What about New York? 
[02:26:30]  You don't like New York?  No, I love New York.  So, then why would you leave?  Because I live somewhere else.  Maybe you should move to New York.  Uh, okay.  Maybe.  Why not?  I would move.  You should.  I like living in Kentucky.  It's nice and mellow.  Where do you live?  He's like, that's really annoying.  Does that bell signify the end of this interview?  No, no, no.  He's just being silly.  Don't worry about that.  Would you like me to continue with the interview?  Yes, we would.  Would you like to?  You know, I hear tell she might be single there, David. 
[02:27:00]  So, maybe ask her a few questions about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes people go to breakups.  Listeners.  That's good.  Where do you, uh, do you live with anybody?  Do you have a roommate?  I don't.  Actually, well, I do, yeah.  He's, he's, he's sort of a roommate.  He?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's all right.  Don't let that get you down.  He's sort of a roommate.  He's gay, David.  What?  He's gay.  He's a roommate.  He's gay.  Is he really?  Absolutely.  Okay, that's, that's good to know.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want you to have another, like, a straight roommate be, be taken away. 
[02:27:30]  Exactly, I'd be all, I'd be kicking down my door every day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't have that.  What's your current, uh, status?  Are you single?  Are you, um, involved with a guy?  Married?  I am all over the place.  I'm all of the above.  All of the above?  All of the above.  See, she's a girl that, uh, you know.  All of the above means you're single, you have a boyfriend, you're married all at the  same time?  Exactly, I have one of everything.  I'm not sure, what does that mean?  Because a lot of times people are married, she's already told us this, and they separate, 
[02:28:00]  and there's the, and the paperwork hasn't gone through, so there's a technical marriage.  Technicalities.  So you're separated, but you're not, you're not officially divorced yet.  Exactly.  Is that too much of a touchy subject for you?  No, absolutely not.  Are you seeing someone right now?  No.  I'm seeing lots of people, but no, not one person in particular.  There you go.  Lots of people.  So how many?  I don't, I have no idea, I can't even count.  There's, I got one in every city.  What?  Whoa!  So, every, you have a, you have a guy, you know, you have a guy in every, like, if 
[02:28:30]  you were on vacation in one city, you're like, well, you'll look up the guy in that  city, and you'll, okay.  That's right.  In Miami?  You always gotta have sugar daddies everywhere you go.  Oh, did I say that out loud?  Do you have one?  Do you have a guy, do you have a guy that you go, that you see when you visit New Jersey?  Uh, yes, actually.  He's looking to represent.  But I can take another one.  I'm from Jersey.  Can I, yeah, maybe I can replace this guy.  Who is, who is this guy?  Uh, he's just a friend.  You like Lisa?  You wanna replace the guy? 
[02:29:00]  Nice.  Do you find her attractive, David?  Definitely do, sure.  Yeah?  What do you like about her?  She's good looking.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's a sweet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, she's good looking.  What else?  I mean, that's...  Is she your type?  Oh!  What do you like about her?  She has cool tattoos.  Look at that tattoo right there.  Yeah, they're...  Yeah.  I guess they're nice, yeah.  No, he doesn't like my tattoos.  No, he's not, he's probably, he's a very easy, he's never did a girl with tattoos.  Oh, I have lots of him. 
[02:29:30]  Hmm.  I don't know.  I don't wanna be too honest.  Should I be honest?  Yes!  Go ahead.  Take a good look and let us know.  Yeah.  Well, well...  Well, you're not looking.  I'm looking, I don't, I'm looking.  I don't know about this tattoo.  If I'm gonna be honest, tattoos really aren't my thing, to be honest.  Well, you're Jewish.  Well, there's only a couple, she has them on her, it's nothing big, on each ankle.  Yeah, tattoos really aren't my thing.  Do you have tattoos anywhere else, Lisa?  I have one on the back of my neck and one on my lower back.  Oh, can you show them the lower back tattoo? 
[02:30:00]  Is that asking too much?  No, of course not.  If it is, I apologize.  All right.  Okay.  What do you think of that one?  As I said before, I'm not really into tattoos.  Well, but it was right above her hiney hole.  I noticed that.  That's right, it's perfect placement for people to see.  I noticed that.  Yeah?  Yeah, I noticed.  She's a very pretty girl.  The tattoos are a turn off, so you can't bring her home to your parents, obviously.  She's just wearing a long skirt, right? 
[02:30:30]  Some socks.  What else?  Yeah.  What do you like about her?  You don't like the tattoos.  What do you like about her?  Look around.  I'm looking, I'm looking.  I don't know.  There seems to be a problem.  What's going on over there?  Yeah, what's the matter?  I don't want to be.  Oh.  I don't want to be.  I don't want to be too honest about my true feelings and embarrass her or make fun of her.  So I don't want to say.  Why would you make fun of her?  I was going to say.  Make fun of me.  She's very sexy.  I don't want to be honest because if I'm honest, it would be rude. 
[02:31:00]  What's rude about it?  Holy Jesus.  I'll turn off your mic.  I just don't want to be rude.  It's kind of rude if I want to save my true feelings.  Lean over to Anthony.  What's rude?  Lean over to Anthony and tell him because I got your mic off.  Oh, okay.  That's on.  I hear it in the headphones.  I didn't turn it off yet.  Take your headphones off.  All right.  Your mic is off.  Whisper to Anthony.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:31:30]  What?  He's a flaming homosexual.  Well, what did you say?  You say it.  I mean, come on.  Just get it out in the open.  That's actually.  Let me tell you something.  Nothing offends me.  That isn't offensive to her.  No.  That would be like a girl whispering to one of her girlfriends, I don't like him.  His cock's too big.  You know?  So you might think it's an insult, but she won't.  So you could just be honest and tell her.  And look her in the eye and tell her that. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  For once.  Look her in the eye.  Whale's eye.  Again.  Again.  All right.  What are we saying now?  You tell the truth.  You just tell her what you told me.  Yeah.  Because it's not an insult.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If I'm going to be honest.  I won't be offended.  It's okay.  Because guys have different tastes.  I have different tastes.  And to be honest, your breasts are a little too big for me, to be honest.  Hey, that's all right.  Your breasts are too big.  Too big.  That's too big for me.  It's okay.  I'm not saying I don't like breasts.  I'm just saying that I like a little smaller.  Hold on, David. 
[02:32:30]  You're only seeing the top cleavage part.  Yeah.  Maybe if you saw the whole breast.  Well, that's why.  Would there be something?  No, but maybe if you saw the what?  A titty monster's going to jump out?  No.  It's not that I don't like.  What do you think about that?  Wow.  I told him.  It's not that I don't like it.  It's just.  Can you take them both out?  Yes, I can.  It's not that I don't like it.  Pump those out.  All right, David, what's wrong with that?  How about this?  They look.  May I?  Yeah, go ahead.  Now, would you feel one just to see how soft it is? 
[02:33:00]  Just see if it.  You can.  She won't forget.  Yeah, but it's not that I don't want to feel.  Wait, wait.  What was he going to say?  What were you going to say?  No, no.  Of course you want to feel, but what?  I just.  Everyone has their own preferences.  Yeah.  Here's their men.  But it's just a tit.  No, no, they're not.  They're hanging out.  No, no, no.  Have you ever grabbed a boob before?  Ever grabbed a tit?  I have, yes.  Where?  I don't know.  Just to have.  Where?  He's like, just to have.  Where?  Walking down the street.  Probably angrily outside a class.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:33:30]  Now, where have you had contact with a breast?  I don't know.  Just to have.  In a club a couple of times.  A club?  They don't let you touch them in strip clubs, sir.  Well.  Some girls do.  Just give a little grab.  You give her a little grab.  They're real, too.  I'm not saying they're not real.  I'm not saying that.  Stop insulting her.  I asked you before if it was insulting.  I said no.  No, it's not.  I asked before if it was insulting.  You said no.  I can say it.  Not touching is insulting.  Yeah, it's insulting.  All right.  In this country.  All right.  Here's David. 
[02:34:00]  He's moving in for a touch.  And don't worry.  Give it a good one.  Use both hands.  Feel the weight.  Feel the weight of it.  Yeah, use both hands.  Feel the weight.  Yeah, you know.  Use both hands, all right?  All right.  Bring your mic over so you can talk.  What do you have to say?  Yeah, let's.  Okay.  I can't really much.  That's all right.  We're fine.  Go ahead.  So what am I doing right now?  Feel it.  There's two big bear tits.  What do you think you're doing?  Yeah, I see.  I see.  How big are those, Lisa?  38 double Ds.  38 double Ds.  Very firm.  No implants, right?  Natural.  All right, David.  Two hands.  Get in there.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  Here we go.  Okay.  Okay.  It's definitely nice to feel, I mean, but.  If it's like you were, like, milking a cow.  Anyone else knows that?  You've got to touch them a little, like, better than that.  You've got to get sexier than that.  You've got to be a little sexy, a little more caressing.  You're, like, giving her a fucking breast exam.  Yeah, I know.  Well, I don't know what you want me to do.  Well, there's two 38 double Ds.  They're bare.  You have two hands.  Do you see how God thinks? 
[02:35:00]  I see.  I see.  David, what would you do?  Just rub it like a big mezuzah.  Yeah, just.  Just do what you would do.  What would you do with those?  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go in there.  You would do that.  He's.  Wow.  He's massaging them.  Yeah.  The way one checks a ham before one punches it.  He was.  It's like.  It's definitely nice.  It's nice.  He was waxing a car.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were doing a little Daniel-san.  You were kind of assaulting them.  Like, you were searching those tits.  Yeah.  Seeing if they'd stolen anything. 
[02:35:30]  Why don't you get gently.  Gently rub your fingers.  Gently rub your fingers over the nipples.  Yeah, grab the.  Grab the nipples.  Let's do that.  Nicely.  Just gently.  Give it a pinch.  So your four fingers go like.  Yeah.  Over her nipples.  There you go, David.  Let's do that.  Wow.  Would you be okay with that?  I'm absolutely fine with it.  Yeah, she's fine.  Apparently.  That's nice that you asked, though.  That's good.  Thank you.  That's very nice of you.  You're very polite.  All right.  Get in there, David.  Give him a little frut.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see how he works the nipple. 
[02:36:00]  Go ahead, David.  Make believe we're not here.  I don't know how you want me to do it.  Much better.  Just kind of let your fingers like go like.  Let your fingers do the walking.  Like, let him skip over the nipple.  Like, pointer, middle, ring, pinky.  Like, vrp, vrp, back and forth like that.  Just to get like a little.  I don't know what you mean.  Just try it out.  Jimmy will help you through it.  He looks like David Patterson reading.  Just like that. 
[02:36:30]  Like, you just caress, pinch a little bit, but lightly.  Yeah, let's go, David.  You feel nicely with your thumb.  Just touch nicely.  Put a knife and cut him off.  All right.  Hey, hey, hey.  Well.  That's good.  Very good, David.  Now, you're scraping gum off him.  Is that the appropriate way?  Yeah, but you're just touching them.  Yeah.  It's like, you should actually put your face against one.  You don't have to do anything.  You just put your face against it.  Yeah, the side of your head.  Nice.  It's like a sleeping.  Yeah, see if she has warm bosoms.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Take your headphones off.  Yeah, it's fine.  We're here.  Yeah, we're here for you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Don't be embarrassed.  You can't see it?  Fine.  Yeah, they can't see.  Go ahead.  Who can't see?  Go ahead.  Don't do it, man.  So what exactly am I doing?  Well, again, there's...  Yeah.  Picture face there.  We got to get this.  No.  What are you doing what every guy in the room wants to do?  We got to get someone to play the part of the jealous husband.  That's nice.  Take your glasses off.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Please, for a second.  Because that was a very... 
[02:37:30]  That was very matronly and motherly, the way you did that.  Yeah, it was.  Do you know how you want me to...  I'll show you.  This is not about me.  This is about...  He's always ready to go.  I'll do it.  I'm not going to do it.  You just go like this.  Brush your lips.  Just gently against the nipple.  Like that.  You don't have to do anything.  Just be gentle.  What was I doing before?  What were you doing before?  You look like a ram fighting another ram for the right to mate.  Come on, dear.  Don't be shy. 
[02:38:00]  Aw, look at that.  With his glasses.  How about your nose, your mouth?  What are you not...  I'm doing what you're doing.  No, you're rubbing your head like fucking...  He looks like Rain Man.  When Rain Man would rub his head against something.  Oh, right.  Rub your...  This is what you're doing.  That's what you're doing.  No, I was doing this.  This is the top of your head.  This is the side of my face.  Watch.  I love this part.  I love this part.  See?  Okay.  You rub your face against the nipple.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Feel free.  He just rubbed his head. 
[02:38:30]  It looks like he's washing his face with a tit.  Looks like they just brought that hot towel in first class.  And he's wiping his face with it.  It happens.  A little bit.  There's nothing...  That's exactly what you were doing.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with what you were doing.  I was doing a little different.  David's doing a fine job.  Yeah, I'm not saying it's bad.  You look shy.  Would you...  Well, I'm shy.  I'm only shy because I didn't know that I was going to be...  Why are you doing this?  I had no idea.  He didn't have enough prep time.  What's your religious background?  Who?  Oh, you.  Me? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Christian, I guess.  Yeah?  Okay.  I grew up Baptist.  I don't know.  What about how filthy is this?  A little mixed religious thing there?  You should suck one.  What if...  Jeez.  You should suck one.  You need a rabbi to bless it first.  Are those kosher tits?  You should just suck one.  Probably not.  You probably should.  You should suck one, I think.  Just a little bit.  Just a little...  I don't think that's a little more inappropriate.  Well, you know, you just start kissing the nipple a little bit and then if, you know, sucking  is involved, that's fine. 
[02:39:30]  If not, you know, you do what you want.  Kiss the nipple.  It's like, uh...  That's like your personal playground right now.  Yeah, kiss the nipple.  I'll show you on the other one.  All right.  Jimmy will show you on the other one.  Thank God there's two.  Yeah, all right.  You hold it up like this.  Okay.  You look at your friends and you go, eh.  You hear?  Oh, you can do that.  That's sweet.  I can give a kiss.  Yeah.  It's like kissing Nana.  I mean, I can do it however I want, but I'm trying to do it the way you were telling  me to do it.  No, whatever you want.  No, no.  You do it your own style. 
[02:40:00]  Why don't you be like De Niro in Cape Fear?  Yeah, yeah.  Cape Fear?  Get in there.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Your own style.  Get in there.  All right.  He's taking the headphones off.  He's going in.  He's going in for the kiss.  Wait, can we get a mic on it?  Ooh.  Hold on.  He's licking.  Hold on.  I was impressed.  That's not fair.  The guy was licking the nipple. 
[02:40:30]  You don't have to back off so quickly, sir.  Wow.  Hold on.  Anthony, can you?  Look at, find out exactly what Anthony wants you to do.  Because I think that was, Anthony, can you tell David?  Oh, I would actually, if you could, grab the breast and do what you were doing.  Grab one of the breasts with one hand.  Yes, yes.  And then just kiss the nipple a little more and then lick around the nipple a little  if you could feel.  That's what I started to do before on my own.  All right, yeah, but you don't have to cut it so short. 
[02:41:00]  You could do whatever, you know, you want.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if you want me to do a specific one.  Yes, whatever, you know, wing it.  Look.  All right.  Wing it.  Yeah.  Yeah, she likes to have fun.  Sure, sure.  Okay.  Don't you worry.  Can you say?  Okay.  What are we doing?  Roll over there.  He's going to kiss her left breast.  Oh, yeah, very good.  Do what I was doing before, just hold it.  Yeah, whatever you're comfortable with.  It's up to you.  You're doing great.  Okay.  Whatever, she likes it.  Come here.  You like it?  Absolutely.  All right.  Good for me.  Come here in a few minutes. 
[02:41:30]  You want me to say anything?  Just get in there.  I'm going to have to say anything.  All right.  Someone is going to play the part of it.  Great.  It's bad.  It's getting better.  Wow.  All right.  That's not bad.  Hey.  You're kind of getting into it there.  I like that.  Yeah.  That's, yeah, you're kind of getting into it.  Do you want to touch her legs?  She has really beautiful legs.  I like she has nice feminine, soft legs. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know if you're going to get a chance at this again, man.  Look at those big boobies.  I didn't know I was going to have this chance at all.  It's fantastic, isn't it?  I didn't know I was going to be doing this.  David, I noticed you were looking at her, oh, that's why.  Oh, wow.  No panties down there.  Wow.  Did you know you were looking at the...  I certainly did notice.  I don't know if I'm supposed to mention that or not, so I didn't say anything.  Well, you noticed, though, right?  I noticed.  Why don't you face him a little bit and a little...  Yeah, can you open your...  Oh, there we go. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  What do you think of that?  What do you think, David?  I forgot that I had a skirt on.  You been that close to one?  It's very nice.  It's nice.  Well, yeah.  Well, most people would yell out Jesus, but in your case...  Look at that, huh?  What do you think?  That's where a cock goes.  Sometimes.  There's a little chuckle.  David, what do you think?  I think it's very nice.  You want to touch it? 
[02:43:00]  I don't know what I'm allowed to do or not allowed to do, so...  Well, ask Lisa.  I'm not going to...  You can touch it if you'd like.  I would touch it if I'm allowed.  All right.  Well, sure.  There it is.  Wow, look at that.  I'll even bring it to you.  Look at that.  So what do I...  Okay.  Sam, get out of the way of that camera.  Just touch it?  Thank you.  Go down there.  Get really close.  Can Sam see?  Hey, could you, like, use your thighs to close up his ears while he's in there?  Why not?  Just...  You don't have to lick it.  Don't lick it.  Just get close.  No?  No, don't lick it.  Just get close.  Just kiss the thighs. 
[02:43:30]  No licking.  No, no licking the pussy.  Just kiss the thighs.  We don't know where she's been.  What?  I don't.  I don't even know who she...  I don't know anything.  It might be all along, though.  You can look at it.  Get close and look at it.  Don't touch it.  Okay.  You can touch it.  You can touch it.  No, you can touch it.  You can give it a touch.  Touch with your fingers.  Give it a touch.  What do you think?  Can you get in there, Sam?  Kiss the thigh.  Can you see?  Yeah.  And then touch a little and kiss the thigh.  That'll work, right?  It should. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, touch the vagina again the way you did.  That was good the way you were touching it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Touch again.  I swear he's going to become a director one day.  I know.  He's good.  Touch.  Do you want to look at the hiney hole next?  It's up to you guys.  What do you want me to do?  I don't know what you want me to do.  We know.  What do I got to do?  Touch it again.  All right.  So touch again.  Touch the vagina.  There you go.  Touch the pussy.  Touch it.  What is he doing, Jimmy? 
[02:44:30]  I can't see.  I don't know.  Do you know where that special spot is?  Find the special spot.  Here's one.  Just run your finger right down that little credit card.  Yeah, it kind of looks like a swipe.  A credit card swipe thing.  You kind of look like you're checking bad fruit.  Yeah, yeah.  You want to touch it.  Just touch it.  Just touch softly.  We want you to find it.  Yeah, that's it.  We want you to find the sensitive area there.  Yeah.  All righty.  Just touch softly.  All righty. 
[02:45:00]  Okay, he's poking around in there.  Is he finding it, Jimmy?  No.  He's running his hands over it.  Along the, but on the outside edges.  Yeah.  So you need to go dead center.  And kind of rub your finger down the middle a little bit.  She's okay with it.  I'm perfectly fine.  Go ahead.  Down the middle a couple of, a couple of few times.  All righty.  All righty.  There you go.  All the way down.  Oh, well. 
[02:45:30]  Lisa, why are you laughing?  I don't know if that's the reaction going for.  No, it's good.  It's the way he's opening.  He looks like he's opening curtains.  Yes, yes.  He's making sure it was opening up.  Well, that's good.  A neat variety.  Do you like the vagina?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Definitely.  Cool.  Could she rub your legs?  I mean, could I feel bad?  Could she rub your leg a little bit?  If she wants to, it's up to her.  I wouldn't mind.  I want to see you rub your leg.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Hey, Lisa, what's okay?  Lisa, what is he packing?  You can feel through his jeans.  Is he packing anything?  Yeah.  I can feel it through the jeans. 
[02:46:00]  So that's always a good sign, right?  That's a good sign.  That's always a good sign.  Why don't you guys get a little closer?  Get a little more comfortable.  Why not?  How close do you want me to get?  As close as you want.  As close as you want me to get.  Obviously, you know.  How close do you want to get?  It's really up to you, whatever she's talking about.  Do you want me to sit on your lap?  She seems to be a wild girl.  Would you like that?  I would like that, sure.  Okay, how about you sit where she is?  This way the Paltois cameras can see.  Okay.  Let them sit first.  Let Lisa, who is a...  Wow, wait. 
[02:46:30]  Wow.  And you sit there, young David, the chair of honor.  The chair of honor.  And you can always talk.  I'm just...  Oh, boy, what a hiney.  You can sit right there.  David, this Lisa is a wild one, huh?  She's great.  I am.  Oh, look at that now.  The hiney.  Yeah.  What exactly?  She'll rub your cock a little.  No, what do you want me to do?  You can grab her boobs from behind.  It would be a good start.  Yeah.  Is there anything specific on me, or I can just do whatever I want?  Now, whatever you want, David.  Now, he's like, I don't want to...  What can I do?  Do you want me to do something specific?  David...  Can someone get in here with a microphone, an extra microphone that we'll reach? 
[02:47:00]  David, at this point, you should...  Grab that one, Jimmy, and just...  Oh, good idea.  Good idea.  All right.  Good idea.  Or hip-hop, you got that on?  There's anything specific you want me to do, or I can just do whatever I want.  How about we do a little freestyle, and you're on your own now.  We set you up nice here.  Hey, Lisa, could you face David?  Maybe you can put your breasts in his face and touch his penis?  Why not?  All right.  It's harmless.  It's harmless, David.  It's fun stuff, right?  It's fun stuff, right?  Scoot back a little, Dave.  Don't be so selfish, please.  No, it's a big chair.  It's not a big chair. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Roll with it.  What?  Let's see what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's...  Well, we can do that any time.  Oh.  Hi, dear.  She's sitting on his lap.  I know.  Do you want to touch her juicy little big...  Yeah, run your hands down her ass.  Yeah, have fun, David.  That's it.  David is...  This little ass.  Aggressively rubbing her boobs.  She's bouncing up and down.  He's rubbing her arms.  That's good.  How about that ass?  He's like a grandmother.  You might want to grab it.  Grab that big ace.  Put your hands around back.  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:48:00]  What do you think, David?  Now, push your hips forward and stick your dick in her.  Yeah.  I mean, no.  I mean, just...  Are you kidding?  Can she rub your penis through your jeans?  I would.  If she wants to.  I would.  All right, yeah.  Keep rubbing.  I would.  He's grabbing her ass now aggressively.  Cool.  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  This is nice.  You like it?  I like it.  It feels better than you probably thought it would.  Yeah.  Right.  David, you want to at least sit in your underwear?  That'd be kind of cool.  Not naked, though.  You can't be naked. 
[02:48:30]  They're going to have you completely naked.  Not naked, but...  Put it in underwear.  Underwear's okay.  No, no, no, no.  No, why not?  I don't think so.  Underwear?  I don't think so.  All right.  Keep...  All right.  I don't think so.  All right.  Play with her boobs and...  Are you embarrassed?  Are you clipped?  Of course I am.  Stop it.  No question is that.  Are you embarrassed?  I guess.  To be in your underwear?  Oh.  All right.  That's okay.  All right.  Do you feel her pussy against your cock over there?  Not really.  The chair is not conducive for that? 
[02:49:00]  Can we get a better chair?  I really don't, to be honest.  No?  How about you lean back a little more and push it?  No, no.  She means...  No, I mean, if you slouch in the chair a bit, you'll get there.  You move down.  Yeah.  Now...  Holy shit.  Dude, your pocket's sticking up.  Whoops.  No, I'm talking about him.  She just backed into a black microphone and the microphone almost disappeared.  I think you have to adjust yourself, don't you? 
[02:49:30]  Oh, me?  Yeah.  Where's your dick?  Down by your pocket?  There's a better chair.  Better chair over there?  All right.  Here, David.  Give him that other chair.  I think David is kind of liking this whole thing.  Yeah, David, get in there.  He can't stand up.  Like a little pup tent.  All right, David.  Now have fun.  This is all you, buddy.  Yes.  This is a little bit...  Oh, see?  There you go.  You guys go at it.  Go at it.  There we go.  She's riding his lap in the jeans.  He has his arms straight out.  All right, Sam. 
[02:50:00]  Sam can move a little bit.  Thank you.  David, you can touch it.  Your arms are in fists straight out.  Spank her a little bit.  What?  If you're going to spank her, take it a little harder than that, dear.  Spank her.  No.  You could spank her.  Just a little tap.  A little love tap.  You want me to show you how to do it?  Yeah.  Let's.  She'll show you.  See?  See?  She doesn't mind it at all.  She likes it.  Exactly.  Yeah, keep spanking her.  I'll have her red eyes.  Yeah.  Might be a bust.  You don't want to do it.  Can we always get back to this?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  What the fuck are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing to my wife?  Huh?  Huh?  Don't be mean.  No, don't be mean.  Don't be mean.  Uh-oh.  I just listen on the radio.  I just listen to this while coming to see.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You're not supposed to be here.  Shut up.  I'll deal with you when we get home.  Okay.  As for you, why are you touching my wife?  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't even know you were here.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know you were her wife. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, fuck.  Look, it's.  Who hides this prick?  Dude, we just.  We told him to be respectful.  I'm like a fucking twit.  Dude, we just thought that we didn't know.  We thought you guys were broken up and shit.  No, we're not broken up.  She said that the horse was.  No, we're not fucking broken up.  All right.  Hold the guy back.  She knows it as well.  Hold the guy back.  This is not good.  We told him to be respectful.  Yeah, hold it.  Yeah, he.  He was okay.  Ooh, this ain't good.  He was nice.  Nice.  He didn't stick anything in anywhere.  David.  I'm going to stick something to him in about three seconds. 
[02:51:30]  How about that?  David, you at least held the guy an apology.  Yeah.  You're not going to tell me an apology.  He's going to get an ass kick in about three seconds.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Look, there's no need for violence.  Dude, there's no need for violence.  He was just...  David, what's the matter?  He was just...  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Now there's going to be a problem.  David.  David.  Stop, stop, stop.  David, run.  What do I do?  David, just fucking run. 
[02:52:00]  Run.  Run while he's being held back.  Fucking run.  Run.  Get out of here.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  How do we like this?  Stop, stop, stop.  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh.  Okay, that guy was really good.  He's very good.  They got audio.  They got audio.  They got audio.  They got audio.  Is this really the husband or is it a joke?  Got me the fuck outside, all right? 
[02:52:30]  Wait.  Chili?  What?  Got him outside.  Holy shit.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Is this really her husband or is it a joke?  Is this a joke like playing on joke on me to try to like...  He's really the husband?  He's really upset?  Come out.  What?  What?  Get the fuck out.  Right the fuck down.  Get the fuck out the room.  Get the fuck...  No, no.  Stop, stop.  Wait a minute.  This is too much. 
[02:53:00]  Get the fuck out of the room.  I can't do this.  Get the fuck out the room.  Get the...  It's my second...  It's my second day of the interim.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm not going to hit it.  Get off me.  Get the fuck out of me.  It's my second day of the interim.  Get the...  It's my second day of the interim.  This is my second day.  Oh, God.  Wait, what am I supposed to...  Oh, wait a minute.  I think it's just...  Yo, Dave, run.  Run.  Run out the room. 
[02:53:30]  Run out the room.  Run.  Run.  Run.  Run.  Hurry up.  David, just run.  Get out.  Get out.  Run, David.  Run.  David, run.  Get out.  Get out of the hole.  Just run.  Get the fuck out of here.  Go downstairs.  Go downstairs.  Go downstairs.  He fell down.  He fell down.  He fell down.  He fell down.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Is he young?  Where did he go?  Yeah, he's gone. 
[02:54:00]  Wow, you did a fucking bang-up job, dude.  That guy was so good.  That guy was fucking good.  He was great.  He's a good actor.  That's a regular listener.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Honey, don't beat up the little white boys.  He comes by and watches the show all the time.  We finally got involved.  Let's bring David in to apologize.  Just don't give it away.  Wait, can we hold him down?  We calmed you down.  Hold him down.  Hold him down.  Like, have him held down in a chair.  He just wants now.  We calmed him down and talk.  All he wants is an apology. 
[02:54:30]  Tell him we calmed him down and talk to him, and he just wants an apology.  Get him in that big chair and make believe you're holding him down.  Who's holding him down?  Me?  You guys.  Yeah, but don't laugh.  Don't give it away.  Okay.  David, he just wants an apology.  Come on.  Come on.  I'll try to get him here to apologize.  Mars.  Hey, Steve.  Should we sit on him?  Okay.  Hold him, Mars.  Hold his arm.  Wait, yeah.  David, yes. 
[02:55:00]  Bring David in.  Did Anthony know he was here and he was going to attack me like that?  They didn't know.  What did you want?  Jim, did you guys know that he was going to come in and attack my end?  Listen, it was planned for me to go in there and do stuff with her.  That was planned.  Yeah, we don't know what's going to happen.  The guy comes once in a while, but we didn't know what the relationship was.  We don't know.  But did you know he was going to come and attack me like that?  How are we supposed to know that?  No, no, no.  He didn't attack you.  He was just yelling.  You could have.  We held him back.  That's fine.  Why did you?  You guys told me to go up to like... 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to do all that.  You know, we would like just touch her respectfully.  We didn't realize you were going to put your fingers in her.  Hey, shithead, get in here.  He just wants you to apologize.  He feels like...  But it wasn't my toy.  You...  He came in, you were sucking her tits.  Face me like a man to get your ass in here.  It's a guy's wife.  It's a guy's wife.  But did you know he was going to be there and attack me?  Come on!  No, I wouldn't have touched her if I knew that.  But just don't say I did anything.  Just apologize.  Just apologize.  Always be here, Martin.  You disrespected the guy.  Holy shit.  Wow.  David, first of all, we owe you an apology. 
[02:56:00]  We didn't know the guy.  I had no fucking idea.  We told him, though.  We did tell David to kind of just be respectful and stuff like that.  I don't mean to.  She comes by the show a lot.  She's a slut.  And I didn't...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You got a little carried away.  First of all, I don't want to offend anybody.  I understand.  We're holding him down, as you can see.  I don't want to offend the husband.  I don't even want to offend you two.  Yeah, but the thing is, we were just telling you to touch her.  But you got a little carried away.  You were stuck in her tits.  You put her on your lap.  We didn't tell you to do any of that stuff.  You were...  What? 
[02:56:30]  I didn't know this was going to even happen.  No, but you're looking between her legs.  You're kind of making her uncomfortable.  Yeah.  He needs to know what you actually did to her.  And then you got to apologize for it.  That's what he told us he wants.  Tell the truth.  For whatever reason.  Sorry for what?  What did you do to her?  He's held down nice.  Look.  He's all right.  Just talk to him.  He's exhausted.  So what do I...  Just tell the truth about what you did.  What did you do?  You make us all look like fucking creeps.  That's all he wants is an apology for...  But he needs to know what you did to his wife. 
[02:57:00]  Because it didn't go all that far.  No, it didn't go all that far.  Not at all.  No.  Because he's thinking it was a lot worse.  So explain what you did.  No, no.  It wasn't a lot worse.  What did you do to Lisa and apologize for it?  Okay.  Well, I came into the...  Look me in the eye and tell him what the fuck you did.  I came into the studio and I met her and I was asking her some questions.  And then what happened?  And then I looked at her.  And then I looked at her and I touched her breasts a little.  And then I kissed them a little.  And then I touched her legs and thigh area a little bit. 
[02:57:30]  And then she...  Tell him everything, Dave.  And then she got on top of me and...  Wait, wait.  Jimmy, there's something out there.  He knows it.  Just tell him everything.  Because everything is videotape.  So he's going to see the videotape anyway.  Look, there's more.  Did you not tell me?  And then after that she got on top of me and started moving up and down.  And I started touching her and caressing her.  Touching her where?  On her breast, on her ass, up and down her back.  I touched her on her vagina a little bit. 
[02:58:00]  You did what?  A little.  What?  Are you fl...  You should have left that part out, probably.  You should say everything.  Yeah, but, you know, by that we would...  Oh, boy.  You know, stuff you get away with.  A strip club.  No, no.  Please get up.  Please.  I want to throw you...  Tell her what she did to me.  Yeah, you better tell her.  What possessed you to do that?  What possessed me?  What the...  Why would you do that?  I don't really know what to say.  I don't know what to...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why would you do that?  I don't know what to say. 
[02:58:30]  What am I supposed to say why I did that?  I don't know.  How about just say that I apologize and I'll take my ass kicked like a man?  How about that?  Say that.  Look, it's not cool you guys are holding the guy down.  Let him go.  I don't think you can do anything.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  Stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  I don't know what to say.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Sit him down.  It's Crown Heights.  Just tell her that she was touching you too, right?  Just say it, David.  You gotta confess.  She was touching me too.  Where?  She was touching me on my dick a little. 
[02:59:00]  She grabbed.  Whoops.  She grabbed it a little.  Whoops.  I slipped and fell.  Oh, boy.  We'll talk later.  Okay.  David.  So, I'm gonna get you.  Um, I just wanna say that, uh, I'm very sorry for doing this.  Oh, you're sorry?  I'm sorry, I apologize, and it'll never happen again.  Oh, yeah, you're damn right that happened again.  I will leave this room, and I won't talk to her ever again if that's what you want.  It won't happen again, so I'm gonna make sure that you'll touch anybody again.  Anybody?  Ever.  I think we, you know, the threats should stay... 
[02:59:30]  Ever.  Maybe just not your wife.  Maybe just not your wife.  You know what?  David.  Go.  Go.  You did your job.  Go.  Okay.  Hurry up.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Run.  Run.  Holy shit.  Asshole.  Go.  Go.  Run.  Holy shit.  Yes.  And scene.  And scene.  Bravo. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  That was great.  It's just a stunt like this guy coming over.  It's like a stunt to play joke for me like this guy.  He really, really didn't know he was gonna be here.  Is it a stunt?  Is that guy in action?  Let me go out to before he knows.  Let me go out there.  Let me talk to him for a more second.  Yeah.  He doesn't know yet, does he?  No.  You want to tell him?  Or should we let it be?  No, I'm not gonna tell him.  I just want to see if it bothers him that a black guy is taking a white girl.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Is he playing a part to joke on me like as a new intern? 
[03:00:30]  Or is he really the husband and he's really upset at me?  Is he really the husband of her?  Have I told you guys how much I love this show?  What's your name, bro?  Carlton.  Carlton, you rule.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I had no confidence that you could actually bring a break.  Come on.  You know how to act mad.  Let's see what you're going to say.  Or is he really the husband and he's really upset about me?  He'd be okay.  He's not a big guy.  He's not going to freak out.  He's relaxing now.  So he's really the husband.  He's really upset.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he thinks that you don't like the whole black-white marriage thing.  That's not true.  When did I say that? 
[03:01:00]  I didn't say that.  You're screaming in the hallway.  Let's go into a speech conference.  I didn't say anything about that.  Yeah, but we saw him yell in the hallway.  I never said that.  Why does he think that?  I don't even...  How do...  How do I know that he's really the...  How do I know that he's really the husband?  I don't know who he is.  I guess so.  I mean, I don't know the guy.  I just know that he came in and he was a little freaked out.  I mean, we got to make it interesting for the radio. 
[03:01:30]  We have to because it's happening.  We can't not make it interesting.  But he thinks...  It's not a joke.  He's really...  Yes, he's the husband.  I mean, he's...  They're okay.  He'll be okay.  He's relaxing now.  Are you playing like a practical joke on me as being a new intern?  Or is he really just came out and you didn't know he was going to come?  No idea he was going to come.  We don't know what that relationship is.  He's been here before, but we didn't know.  You know, we don't ask.  You promise?  He's really the husband?  He's really upset?  Yes.  Okay.  He thinks that the whole interracial thing is bothering you.  But I didn't.  And that you're basically...  Is that okay? 
[03:02:00]  Because basically he thinks that the whole black and white issue is what...  Like, you feel like it's a black man with a white woman and you don't like that.  So you can pretty much do what you want to do.  What gives him the right to think?  And I didn't say anything about...  Gives him the right.  He thinks that because he thinks, like, yeah, you know she was dating a natural black guy.  And they were just going to grab her big white titties and not care what he thought.  Well, I didn't...  When I was grabbing her titties, I didn't know that her husband was black.  How did I know?  I didn't know that. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, but he thinks that you did know it.  And that's why you did.  You didn't tell me that her husband was black.  Yeah, but I told him I did because he was mad at me.  But I didn't know.  Well, tell him that.  Don't tell me that.  Tell him that.  Just tell him that because he thinks...  I'm not going to go near him.  He's going to, like, punch me in the face.  He's going to knock me unconscious.  He's going to knock me unconscious, this guy.  I don't know.  We'll look out for you.  But just make sure that...  Just apologize to him.  I...  Well...  He thinks that you saw...  I didn't know that he...  Your husband didn't fucking tell me. 
[03:03:00]  You don't care that their interaction is out of you.  He's sitting right there.  How do you not pick him up?  What happened, Jimmy?  You guys couldn't...  I was saying, basically...  We didn't hear.  We took a break.  What happened?  Basically, I was telling David the issue of race and how...  Yeah.  That the husband feels that... 
[03:03:30]  You know what he was saying about how...  And, like, about David grabbing her big white tits  because he didn't like the fact that she was with a black guy  and he hates that kind of shit.  And, um...  You know, now he's claiming he didn't know her husband was black.  Whatever.  I mean...  David?  Hmm.  What?  Is that true?  That is true.  The honest truth is that I didn't know that her husband...  Her husband was black.  And even if...  And even that you are black, that doesn't mean anything to me.  I'm not...  I'm not racist.  I don't...  I'm not...  I don't care about that. 
[03:04:00]  That's fine with me.  I don't have a problem with racism...  With race like that.  You don't have a problem with racism?  Yeah, you basically say that if she wants to ruin her life, you don't care?  No.  I don't have a problem with her marrying a black man.  I didn't even know that her husband was black.  No one told me that.  But you probably knew she had a husband and you didn't care.  And even that you are black, it doesn't matter anything to me.  And I'm not trying to be offensive to you at all.  And if I was by any means, I sincerely apologize to you.  I am sorry.  And you don't say the N-word, right?  Never.  Never.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Have you ever said it? 
[03:04:30]  We all have said it.  I've never said it.  That's the problem.  There's dishonesty here.  Yeah.  We all say it.  We're not proud that we do.  And we make sure there's...  Make sure the windows are rolled up usually.  So like everybody admits to it, you probably said it at one point in your life.  Maybe as a kid, it's a stupid thing to do.  I understand that.  Anyone would understand that.  But I wouldn't say it to anyone's face.  No, no.  But you've said it before.  I know that.  At least everyone has.  Not to...  Wait, Jimmy, have you said the word? 
[03:05:00]  No.  Not proud of it, but you have.  Anthony, you don't even have to ask Kim.  I have.  Sam, have you said it?  I've said it.  Hip-hop?  Yeah, I've said it.  Steve?  Lisa?  Yeah.  Probably in bed.  Yeah, sure.  Mars?  Yes.  Yeah.  Have you said the word?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Under what circumstances?  Wait, what word?  What's that?  What word have you said?  I've said nigger a couple of times.  What? 
[03:05:30]  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  Not in front of anybody.  Not in front of anyone.  You just did.  Yeah, but I'm not saying to be offensive to him.  I'm saying because we're talking about it.  You're saying, did you ever say...  David, when I said what, everyone says the N-word.  Wow, you say the N-word now.  He is getting fucking pissed.  So when did you say it, not in front of people, what does that mean?  That means that's your true feelings.  No.  When do you say it then?  Never, very rarely.  When?  What occasions?  Never, very rarely. 
[03:06:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  You should apologize for calling him, uh...  I didn't call him.  I didn't call him the N-word.  I just said, like, yes, I said it before.  I didn't call it to him, and I never would.  But when have you said it?  You said you say it, like, frequently.  No, I didn't say I say it frequently.  No, I didn't.  When do you say it, though?  You said on occasion it'll come out, but not around people.  No, not on occasion, no.  When?  It won't come out.  It usually never comes out.  I just...  You were...  The question was, have you ever said it?  So, yes.  When did you say it?  When was the last time you said it?  I honestly can't remember.  I was just joking around with friends. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  What kind of joke was that?  I really don't remember.  Like for me to help you to remember?  What?  You like for me to help you to remember?  Oh, boy.  No.  Uh-oh.  Is everyone okay here?  Lisa, you all right?  Having your...  I'm okay.  I'm very uncomfortable.  You're okay with the fact that David, the Jewish guy, was squeezing your big tits and fingering you?  You all right with that?  It was fine with me.  Did we take it too far?  No, it was okay with me.  All right.  David, you were all right with that, obviously, right? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  I was all right with that.  I didn't know her husband was going to come and barge in like that.  Yeah.  Hopefully he can't block you, basically.  Yeah.  Basically, yes.  Were you thinking, um...  I cock-blocked you.  Wow.  I think he's just goofing around, sir.  I think he's just like...  First he said, and what, now I'm cock-blocking you from hitting on my wife.  Well, obviously, you came in here...  You just make a bad situation worse for yourself, son.  What's that?  Just keep making a bad situation worse for yourself.  Just keep on talking.  David, what do you think of someone that would...  Keep on talking. 
[03:07:30]  What do you think of someone that would, like, you know, fool around with you that easily that's married?  Hmm.  Go on, say it.  I mean, I dare you.  I think, in a way, you gotta defend yourself here because...  No, he doesn't.  You know.  Well, if I'm gonna be honest, I mean...  Yeah, yeah, be honest.  She told me that she was separated from her husband.  Really?  So, I mean, which means...  I took it to mean that...  She wasn't divorced.  We knew that, right?  Well, I knew that she wasn't divorced.  But she said that she was separated and that she wasn't seeing, like, her husband anymore. 
[03:08:00]  They were separated.  They were going to get a divorce.  So, I thought, like, okay.  I didn't...  So, you feel that that's a green light for you to just go and just start feeling her up?  Yeah.  What do you think of Lisa for letting you do that now that you know that she actually is far from being divorced, obviously?  What do you think of Lisa?  Well, I think that's kind of...  Well, that could be a little bit rude.  I mean, you should have at least warned me.  Well, I didn't know he was coming.  You didn't know that he was in...  Did you know he was in New York?  No.  Where did you think he was?  Back in Kentucky?  I don't know.  You didn't know that he was in New York?  I don't pay any attention to where he's at. 
[03:08:30]  How do you not pay attention to your own husband?  Because we're not together.  But...  So, you're not together.  No.  But we're still technically married.  Well, but if you're not together and you're not seeing each other, why is it all set, then?  I don't know.  So, you're basically saying that, look, you guys are separated.  So, basically, you're open game for any guy to come in and hit on.  Well, if you were separated and you weren't seeing each other, it would kind of mean that.  Tell him to beat it, then.  So, basically, you're saying the husband has no right to be here and be angry.  No.  But, no, I'm also saying that she could not be telling the truth to get me to do that stuff. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, she's a liar.  It could be that she's lying.  I don't know who's telling the truth.  I don't know any of these people.  Your wife's a liar.  I don't know who's telling the truth.  Well, you've already said she's easy, and now you're calling her a liar.  I don't know who's telling the truth.  All right.  You said way too much already.  I'm about to just get the hell out of it before someone hurts you.  That's the one being made.  Leave.  Leave.  I'm telling you, get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, Jesus.  Just go.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you're out again. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  All right.  Keep running.  Don't stop.  You hit the outside.  He sure does know how to run out of the place.  There's one for the books.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, we got to.  Should we tell him?  We should tell him because we're going to find out during the break.  Let's bring him in.  Yeah, of course.  Now?  Yeah, because I don't know what to find out during the break.  Can't keep having him right in the hallway.  Yeah.  Bring him in.  We know he stretched it out, but it was just kind of fun.  All right.  Bring David. 
[03:10:00]  He's like, no.  He was such a nervous wreck.  Oh, my God.  Was he scared?  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, we did.  Just one make-believe.  That was good.  Oh, he was so scared.  Is this a joke?  Is this more real?  He kept asking over and over again.  It's a joke.  Wait, will you hold him?  Yeah.  All right.  Right.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Just tell him.  Stop, stop.  David.  It's okay.  It was a real bad day.  Do you have something to say there, sir?  When it's least expected, you're elected. 
[03:10:30]  You're the one to...  Am I supposed to talk?  Well...  No.  We're good.  He doesn't even know her.  No.  He doesn't?  He never met her before in his life.  That's what I was asking you before, and you were saying it was a husband.  Yes, we were lying.  Yeah.  I said that.  I said that, and you said...  I said that, and you said...  I said that as a joke, and you said, no, it's a husband. 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  As far as we know.  Yes.  That's all the lies.  I asked you if it was a joke, and you said no.  Yes.  That's of course.  Why would we give it away?  So if I may ask a real question, who are you, by the way?  Are you just a random listener off the street?  Not random.  I'm a long-time listener.  Yeah.  Big fan of the show.  We didn't even know he could act as well.  Yeah.  I saw him run in.  He looked like...  I saw him run in.  I'm like, oh, this guy.  Fuck, I didn't even know him.  He did a pretty good job.  Yeah, he was very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How about this?  To prove that everything is okay, how about each one of these gentlemen, in a sign of solidarity, 
[03:11:30]  could each one of them perhaps suck one breast in tandem?  I think that would be very fair.  I suck in that.  I suck in that.  Go for it.  We've got to figure out how to get that online, man.  Is she topless?  We can block our tits.  All right, we'll figure something out.  We'll just put your houseboats in front of them.  I won't be thinking ahead of time.  Hold on, can we have one person I expressed to close this bit out?  Yeah.  Get over there, David.  I was really scared.  Yes, we know you were.  That was the beauty of it.  Don't get it, David.  He doesn't care.  He's a pervert.  He wants to suck her.  He's actually shaking the guy's hand. 
[03:12:00]  I don't know who you are.  All right, go ahead.  Do that.  All right.  Come on.  Each one suck a tits.  Great.  It's great.  I love my life.  So cool.  There it is.  Look at that.  We can get along.  On one side, his dad would be disappointed, and on the other, hers would be disappointed.  Should we get married?  Sure.  Okay, cool.  That guy was great.  What's your name, man?  You're here all the time.  Carlton.  Carlton.  That was fucking great.  Thank you.  He didn't break.  He didn't crack.  No. 
[03:12:30]  No.  I was laughing all the time.  Yeah, he was very good.  Do you act or no?  No acting.  That was good.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll take a break, and we'll all jerk off on Lisa's tits.  All right.  I was leaving you for a while.  Yes, of course.  Oh, really?  For a while, you were.  For a while.  For a while.  The whole time, you ran out, you dummy.  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  We're back.  Yes.  We've got to head out.  Let's see.  We're down to the fourth string on the keyboard next to you, huh? 
[03:13:00]  We're down to the fourth string.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone's leaving the show.  Everyone's just leaving.  Yeah.  But, um...  Lisa did a great job.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to leave to go do something very important.  Very important indeed.  But Lisa Sparks was a trooper today.  All right.  What's your website, Lisa?  LisaSparks.com.  S-P-A-R-X-X-X.  Triple X's.  Oh, triple X's. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It's just a weird way to spell it.  I think it means triple X.  I think you have sex.  I do.  I bet you make a few bucks off that website.  I would guess...  Once or twice.  Yeah.  $10, $20.  Do you do webcam shows or something?  I don't.  I used to.  But when I moved to a new house, this whole summer I was moving into a new house and I  moved into a smaller one and I have no place to do it now.  Oh, no.  Because, like, I'm all...  We're like, okay.  Are you sexually active?  Am I sexually active? 
[03:14:00]  Just a little bit, yeah.  Just a little bit.  I was having sex this morning before I got here.  Were you really?  No, I'm kidding.  I wish.  Anthony wants to know how many loads you've taken over the years.  Wow.  I don't even...  I don't know if I can count.  Yeah.  Do you prefer, like, if a guy comes on you or do you like...  No, I'd rather eat it.  Would you?  Oh, yeah.  Guys, it's...  Yeah.  We've got a come eater among us.  You'd rather eat the come?  Yeah.  It's cleaner and I like the way it tastes.  You do?  Wow. 
[03:14:30]  Can I ask you a question?  What is the most guys you've had...  An angel from heaven.  Right?  I know.  Everybody says it.  I was like, I love you.  What is the most guys you've had come in your mouth in one day?  I think 40.  40?  Not all at the same time, but, like...  Did you swallow all that come?  Did you get sick?  No.  Was it a bukkake?  Yeah.  Well, it was...  I did a gangbang that we had them all do.  Did they come in glasses and stuff?  No.  Okay.  No.  The bukkake, the American bukkake that I did for JM Productions like 100 years ago, I 
[03:15:00]  did it with the goggles, like scuba goggles, and they took the lenses out.  Oh, so...  And they'd been wanting to do it for years and couldn't find anybody that would let them  do it.  So you have to keep your eyes open?  Yeah.  And you have to keep your eyes open.  And I was like, that's fine.  I know how to clean.  Keep my eyes.  I'm getting red.  You have to keep your eyes open, and didn't the semen burn?  It did, and my eyes were red for about two hours, but there's stuff that cleans them  out.  What?  Guess?  No, no, no.  Bows and Lows.  Guess?  No.  Like, the contact people make an eye wash that cleans out.  Cum wash?  Yeah.  Clean your eye out.  You clean it out a couple times and put some eye drops in, and a couple hours later, they're 
[03:15:30]  fine.  But are they tested?  Because aren't you scared of getting, like, herpes in your eye?  Or fucking...  They're tested.  Everybody's tested.  For everything or just AIDS?  No, everything.  They're tested on rabbits, man.  Yeah.  They're dropping a rabbit's eye.  Um, every once in a while, people get tested for herpes, but...  It's mostly...  So far, I haven't had a herpe grow out of my eyeball yet, so I'm pretty good.  But you know what I'm saying?  That would be scary.  Yeah, it would be.  In the fucking eye.  That would blow.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just touching my penis.  It was, I was like...  Yeah, he was squeezing the helmet.  It was five years ago now, so...  Let's, uh, let's bring David in, too, and thank him for being...  He did a good job.  We love David. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, David.  And Carlton playing...  You'll be dead now if it wasn't my David!  That's right.  That's Carlton playing the, uh, part of the angry black husband, which was just, uh, you  can't write stuff like this.  David, she's a, she's a major porn star.  Yeah.  I did not know that.  Wow.  Now you do.  Now I do.  That would be why my husband doesn't care.  Yeah, right.  And she really does have a husband, but he doesn't care like she said.  But he doesn't care because she's a porn star.  She does pornography.  We watched her suck a penis last time she was here.  That's right.  She did it well, by the way.  You should actually, is there a clip, uh, on the, on the web that you could pop up 
[03:16:30]  anywhere?  Oh.  Several.  Hold on.  I should have all laid the page one of frowns.  Maybe you could.  No.  I did clean it up.  Fucking idiots.  Yes.  I want to, maybe if we, we, you could watch her in action.  Let's see.  You know, she's right in the room.  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  Kind of exciting.  I'm watching your schmecker.  We have the stock market thing down.  Told you.  We told you we'd go back down today.  How much did it?  Oh, are you? 
[03:17:00]  Well, it has a few hours of ground.  It'll bounce back.  You think it'll bounce back again?  Sure.  Ah, so David, yeah, she likes, uh, why don't you ask her what her move is in porn?  Every porn star has a favorite move.  Right.  And they're known for that move sometimes.  Right.  I do?  Oh, you don't have a move?  I don't know.  Well, tell them what your claim to fame is.  You have a record.  Oh, I do.  I own the gangbang record, yeah.  I guess.  You know what a gangbang is?  I know what it is.  How many, at least?  9.19.  In how long a period of time?  Seven and a half hours. 
[03:17:30]  What?  Whoa.  Yeah.  What?  What?  Oh, look at that.  Hey, there I am.  With your husband.  Yeah, right.  Put my husband in there.  Do you remember that moment?  It's a black gentleman.  You don't remember that moment?  No.  Dude, I've shot so much.  I don't...  People do that all the time.  They'll send me messages on MySpace.  So, you know, like that movie that you're in with that one black guy?  And I'm like, really?  Okay, you're going to have to be a little more specific.  Like, what was I wearing?  Maybe I can remember by what I was wearing, but...  Cum?  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:18:00]  I've been like, I am not quite sure.  But people have favorites, so it's usually the same movie.  Yeah.  Over and over.  Do you work with Lex Steele?  I haven't.  Him and I had like a feud.  Why?  I don't really know.  Like, he blew me off once, and I got really...  Professionally or personally?  No, professionally, I got really irritated.  He blew me off.  And I was like, well, you know what?  You didn't reciprocate?  Do you think you are, right?  How did he blow you off?  How should I...  I asked him to do a shoot with me, and he had already asked me before, and I couldn't  do it at that moment.  So, because I couldn't do it when he wanted to do it, it didn't work whenever I wanted 
[03:18:30]  to do it.  Put that last picture back on, Steve.  I like how she's kind of checking out what's going on back there.  You know, she's got a cock in her hand in front.  She's on all fours.  Guy's tagging her from behind.  He wasn't quite getting it in.  I think that's what it was.  Oh, is that it?  And you're like, yeah, let me...  Yeah, I'll be right back with you, dick in front of me.  Let me check out the dick behind me.  He couldn't hear a rod?  No, I couldn't get it in, I think.  And I was trying to move around to get it to...  Yeah, it looks like you're trying to parallel park. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You got like a head over your shoulder.  You're like, yeah, let me see.  I don't want to hit the curb again.  I can sit in the slot.  Let me see if I can back up into this cock.  Yeah, and I got cock room in front of me.  Yeah, you're a parallel parking between two cocks.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Well, David, you were a star today, my friend.  Yep.  Thank you.  Only your second day, is this?  Correct.  Fucking A.  You are already a star on your second day.  How about that?  You're a sparkling personality.  You'll be a husband by Friday.  Yeah.  That's how it works on this show.  Because we run everything into the ground. 
[03:19:30]  Relegated to making copies in the back, never to be on the air again.  Remember Pat Duffy?  Who?  Exactly.  Bill.  Say, Bill.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Pat Duffy.  Why are you laughing at Pat Duffy?  He just, Pat Duffy.  Why are you laughing at Pat Duffy?  No, I'm not laughing.  I just.  Why did you laugh?  No, because you were talking about him.  I was just wondering.  Wondering what?  Oh, Jesus.  What are you wondering?  There's somebody that ain't faking it, by the way.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy is a vile, violent man.  Is he? 
[03:20:00]  Who will fuck you up.  He will snap you in two, didn't he?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, stay away from him.  Why did you say Pat Duffy and then go?  No, it's just a coincidence.  We never.  The laugh said.  The laugh spoke volumes.  Your laugh said.  We never are buddies.  We're neighbors.  Oh, well, fuck it then.  I'm sorry.  No, that's okay.  No, no.  I said fuck it then, they're friends, so you can't bullshit them about Pat Duffy.  They're neighbors.  We're not really friends.  We're neighbors.  Oh.  Not neighbors, like literally.  He lives two towns and over from me.  You're not neighbors.  That's a neighbor.  Two towns.  Oh.  We live in the same planet. 
[03:20:30]  Yes.  We're neighbors.  We both orbit the sun at the same time.  Wow.  How are you neighbors and you're two towns away?  Seven bucks.  I don't know.  Oh, look at that.  They're yelling out there.  Oh, shit.  Is that Dirk?  He's insane.  Dirk?  It's dementia or something.  What happened?  He just starts yelling stuff.  Who was yelling about seven bucks out there?  Derek?  Derek.  What?  Derek.  Where's fucking shizzler Derek's?  Someone said, how much did you pay for that Timothy Hutton hairdo? 
[03:21:00]  Bring that lunatic in here.  What's in that?  Derek, what are you screaming about seven bucks?  This is fucking sandwich.  Why would the mic be on?  Why?  Why?  Derek.  Over here.  What happened?  That fucking seven dollars for this fucking thing.  Get the fuck out of here.  And I asked for a hoagie, too, and it's this fucking thing.  You should have sent hoagie boy.  Why wasn't hoagie boy sent?  Uh-oh, hoagie boy.  Bring hoagie boy here.  Hoagie boy should have been sent.  Is that E-Roc?  Stupid haircut of E-Rocs. 
[03:21:30]  Hoagie boy, everyone.  Did you like that bit?  No.  You don't like the bit?  The hoagie boy bit?  I thought it was great.  You get a haircut like the fucking gay marine in American Beauty.  Oh, that's different.  Every time I get my hair cut, it's usually a boy's life.  Oh!  I guess you fucking suck, Jimmy, according to E-Roc.  Maybe E-Roc's right.  I doubt it.  What can I say?  Stop.  Maybe hoagie boy has a point. 
[03:22:00]  Hoagie boy.  Here's a little hoagie watch.  He pushes the end of the hoagie, and the bun's open, and the time is there.  And it's just, what number is the little hoagie on, and what number is the big hoagie on?  A magic hoagie watch.  It's half past five hoagies.  You're hoagie boy.  No, they're not.  It's the five.  It's a number five, a number six, a number seven.  Different types of hoagies.  Like his favorite hoagies in the shop. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  All right, I can't wait to see an animation on hoagie boy.  Wow, what's going on there?  Well, David, what's going on there?  Oh, some smudged makeup.  Let's ask David.  David, what's going on there in that picture?  Is that Lisa?  Yeah.  I'm on top.  I see, yeah.  Her makeup is running.  I wonder what happened.  It really is.  David, explain what's going on in that picture.  What's going on there?  Lisa is there with some other girl.  I don't know.  Give another fish hook. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  The other girl is getting it from the guy.  I was in Vegas.  See, I do remember something.  Oh, yeah?  That was in a Venetian hotel bathroom.  You look like you're really enjoying yourself.  The girl's retired now, but she was so much fun.  She was one of my closest friends.  Her name was Holly.  Extreme Holly.  She was out of Arizona.  She was now running for vice president.  No.  Yeah, right?  No, that's not her.  David, you're not describing anything.  What's in the picture?  Yeah, David.  I described.  It's radio.  With radio, you got it. 
[03:23:30]  The listener cannot see it all.  That's true.  I know that.  Okay.  So you must describe things and paint a picture, if you will, for the audience.  So look at that picture.  Okay, we're looking at it.  And now let the audience know.  I'm not done yet.  Let the audience know exactly what you're seeing just through words.  All right.  We're looking at a picture that's on Lisa's website.  We have Lisa, and we have another girl below her.  And we have a guy whose dick is on top of the face of the girl below Lisa. 
[03:24:00]  And mention all the cum, David.  There's a lot of cum in this picture.  Yeah, and there seems to be a lot of cum on the picture on this girl's face.  Yeah.  And Lisa's just standing there staring, looking up at the guy.  With a big smile.  She's got a smile, but she's not doing really anything.  Wait, what do you think Lisa...  Not doing anything.  She's holding the other girl's head.  What do you think Lisa's thinking in that picture?  I don't know.  Well, come use your brain.  What do you think she's thinking?  I think she's pretty excited in that picture.  No, but what is she thinking? 
[03:24:30]  She's got this look on her face.  What is she thinking?  What's she thinking?  Put a little bubble above her head.  She could be thinking, wow, that's it.  Yeah, exactly.  What?  Exactly.  She could be thinking, wow, that's a big load.  She could be.  I don't know.  I think I was thinking, give it to me, daddy.  Nice.  Nice, right?  That's a big load.  She could be thinking, oh, look at that load.  Yeah.  She could be.  Big load of cum.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:25:00]  We do have to go.  Line of the day stuff.  Big load of cum.  Yeah.  Do you want her to masturbate while we do line of the day?  She does that thing.  Big load of cum.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Lisa, could you give us like an orgasm while we do line of the day?  I can fake one for you.  I need not love her.  I'm not a masturbator.  I don't masturbate very much.  You don't need to.  I'm exactly right.  I don't need to.  You don't have bucks like David.  Get enough dick, right?  Absolutely.  Nice.  I get enough of everything.  Dream come true.  That's right.  Would you ever let Lisa on some occasion touch your penis? 
[03:25:30]  I did touch it today.  But I mean like bear.  Just touch it, squeeze it.  Was he sporting?  I could feel it through the pants.  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes it's hard through denim, so.  Were you sporting a little there, David?  A little.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You were shy, right?  A half.  Would you like her to grab it angrily?  Yeah, I'd say give me a cum bath.  Wow.  Wow.  You'd love to give her a cum bath.  Wow.  Probably, yeah.  I would.  David, what are you going to tell your parents about today's event? 
[03:26:00]  Whoa.  The event.  Wow.  Well, last time we had some problems, we had to make sure you didn't go home and like  tell them stuff.  What are you going to tell them?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's play act.  You come home and I go, David, how was you?  Wait, wait.  No, no.  Well, I can't do the thing.  So, all right.  Anthony, we'll play your father.  David, how was your day?  Don't rush the boy.  He's relaxing.  Why can't you let me ask?  He has an internship with the radio staff. 
[03:26:30]  Why do you always argue with me?  Let the boy eat.  He worked hard.  I try.  He worked.  I want to just know what he did.  Let him have matzo.  But anyway, we have some eagle for you.  Google, whatever it's called.  But I want to know, how was your day?  You're acting like a crutch.  Why do you have to keep nagging?  Give the boy pennies. 
[03:27:00]  I just want to know.  David's got gay parents.  I like this.  All right, David.  They're going to ask.  What are you going to tell them today?  We need to know.  I'm going to tell them that I was on the air quite a bit.  I'm going to tell them I did a sports report.  And that's it?  I'm going to tell them I did a sports report.  What else, David?  I did a Jewish sports report, I might say.  What was the girl? 
[03:27:30]  We heard the girl about the girl.  I don't think they were going to have heard that.  Maybe somebody emails them from this show with video of their little boy grabbing a tits.  That would entail someone from the show knowing their email address.  They can find anything that they want.  We know everything.  You can find out their email?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Maybe they'd like a photo of young David licking a tit.  No.  No, because we've got to get more gold out of this. 
[03:28:00]  You were attacked by a schwarzer?  What happened, David?  How are they going to find that out?  If I don't tell them, they're...  A schwarzer and a schwarzer?  Oh!  Hi!  I love this David.  He's shady.  This kid is shady.  Shady.  The parents will not find out about this.  David, when I said give her a cum bath, he said I would like that.  He wants to fucking...  Oh, yeah.  He's filthy.  He wants to spray.  He wants to angry on Antimus.  He wants to spray, man.  You're a filthy guy.  I think you really got a dark side where you want to, you know, really do some nasty shit. 
[03:28:30]  Lick some ass, right?  Would you lick the ass?  Lick some ass.  Come on, Jim.  Spread them.  Yeah.  Yeah?  You like maybe a nice chick?  You spread them apart?  I would like that.  Would you lick that ass?  Sure.  Yeah, you're a true man, then.  Sure I would.  Only real men lick ass.  I would on a girl, sure.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I mean.  Would you, uh, would you throat suck a girl?  Or you'd put your penis in her mouth and then, like, you kind of just like... 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, I would.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  For a girl, sure.  Anything.  For a girl.  Yeah, for a girl.  We know you're not gay.  Would you just stick your dick in a girl's ass?  Yeah.  Without a condom?  Oh, no.  Probably not like that.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, what are you, a communist?  Rookie.  Rookie.  All right, listen.  We got to do line of the day.  We're late now.  Yeah.  How stupid are we?  We're dumb as dirt.  A very important day, and we're late already.  We're stupid.  Line of the day is sponsored by CarboNight.com.

How long have you been doing radio, you dope?  Come on.  Oh, my dear sweet God.  Jimmy caught it.  Are you a fish in the sea?  Yeah, of course I caught it. 
[03:30:00]  Are you insane?  No, I assure you it was her.  Steve.  Oh, my God.  Steve.  What did you do?  You made line of the day a runner-up.  Yeah, thanks.  Nice.  Wonderful.  Another runner-up line of the day.  He's standing between her legs, right?  Well, they say face to knee.  I say face to can't.  Oh, of course.  There she is.  Speaking of the tall broad.  That monster. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, God.  What is that thing?  Another runner-up line of the day.  Because no one's taking you seriously if you're saying it that way.  It just, that's all I'm fixated on now.  Oh, I just want to play it over and over again.  Why are you saying that?  I bet you they do it on purpose.  I bet you when the news left, she's like, I got four in.  Fucking great.  That was a great story today.  Yeah.  Lots of laughs over that one.  Maybe we can get her on tomorrow once they have resolution to their problem.  Maybe she'll come on and celebrate and go, it was great. 
[03:31:00]  And congratulate her.  That's a good idea.  Once the stump is pulled out of the ground.  Yeah, exactly.  Dumpster's in place.  Her friend's body.  Her friend was killed by the fucking chainsaw incident.  I'm not leaving.  Yeah.  They should just get a snow plow and just plow them over in the tree at the same time.  Just pull it over.  While the plow tows the dumpster and just, like, fucking unhoots it.  It doesn't even stop.  Right.  The final runner-up line of the day.  He doesn't even know her. 
[03:31:30]  No.  He doesn't?  Never met her before in his life.  That's what I was asking you before, and you were saying he was a husband.  Yes, we were lying.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Lisa Sparks with 3Xs.com, right?  That's it.  That's it.  Carlton, anything you're plugging?  You're hoping to plug Lisa Sparks.  I don't know what's going to happen there.  Working on it.  Lisa, any vibe there at all?  It's my husband, so yes, of course. 
[03:32:00]  Would you throw him one for the show or what?  We'll see.  We'll see.  That means no.  We'll see.  Ah, here he is.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad.  I'm sure if I was young, I could fix it.  No. 
[03:32:30]  You three old cants.  I ruin things.  I ruin things.  All right.  Wonderful.  Love those old bags.  Yeah.  Battle Axe.  Battle Axe.  Do you know at one point in my life, I thought it was Babble Axe.  Babble?  No.  I know.  To fight with a Babble Axe.  I don't know.  You just hold somebody that just goes, ah, well, I'm here.  What am I going to do?  I don't know. 
[03:33:00]  Boo.  No, that was funny.  I think Stalker Patty has to meet this David.  He'd hate it.  David.  You think?  David.  When are you in next, David?  Friday.  You'll be dead now if it wasn't my David.  Yeah.  You're going to meet Patty Friday.  Are you going to tell her, Brods?  How old are we talking?  I don't know, but she looks a lot younger.  How old are you?  She's shy.  How old are you, David?  Good question. 
[03:33:30]  Have we established that?  No, that's what we're asking.  We forgot.  How old are you?  26.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What?  Left back a few times.  What?  This is an internship.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  What happened, David?  I can't do that.  What?  Oh, boy.  He looked at Steve like Steve knows some dreaded secret.  There's your cliffhanger.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.
