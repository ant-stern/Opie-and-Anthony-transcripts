<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Weird Medicine" segment featuring Dr. Steve, followed by a flurry of commercials for various products and services, including hotels, makeup, business incorporation, Carfax reports, weight loss supplements, and language learning software.  The hosts then prematurely announced a Metallica concert at the Apollo Theater in September, a revelation that sent SiriusXM employee Roland into a panic.  Numerous text exchanges between the hosts and a visibly stressed Roland, pleading for them to retract the announcement and remove it from replays, dominated the conversation.  Despite Roland’s escalating anxiety,  the hosts persisted, leading to the story being picked up by ABC News and TMZ.  The segment culminated with Roland storming into the studio, visibly upset, to confront them directly about the fallout.  A future guest appearance by Robert Zimmerman (brother of George Zimmerman) was also mentioned.

The show then segued into a chaotic, humor-filled attempt by Jim Norton to get a photograph with Metallica, who were present in the SiriusXM studios but not scheduled to appear on the show.  This endeavor involved multiple interruptions and updates from various individuals involved in the effort, highlighting Norton's obsessive pursuit of celebrity photos and the considerable logistical hurdles involved.  This segment also included a brief, amusing encounter with Tony Danza, who was also at the SiriusXM studios.  Half the room left during Danza's interview, a fact the hosts later lamented, compounding the overall chaos by revealing they’d forgotten to have Danza sign a book for Norton.  Throughout this segment, E-Rock, Sam Roberts, Florentine, and Club Soda Kenny were mentioned as being present in the background.

Mike Francesa, a sports talk show host, called in to discuss Alex Rodriguez and the New York Yankees, his comments interspersed with reflections on the Pope and his own emotional response to Mariano Rivera's retirement.  The hosts heavily criticized Francesa's broadcasting style, describing it as rambling, boring, and lacking passion, despite his popularity and high salary.  They further mocked his perceived lack of professionalism and engagement while watching and reacting to his coverage of the new Pope’s announcement.

Following Francesa's call, Robert Zimmerman joined the studio.  The conversation focused on the George Zimmerman trial verdict, the media's portrayal of the case, its aftermath, and his personal experiences during the trial, including the limitations imposed on him by the court.  He discussed his perspective on the events leading to the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the public perception of his brother, and the dangers George faced. This discussion of the George Zimmerman trial continued with analysis of his lawyer's opening joke and its potential impact on the jury, involving a legal expert, Chris (presumably an attorney), offering alternative approaches.  Robert Zimmerman Jr. further detailed the emotional toll of the trial, his music career, and his advocacy for his brother, contrasting his approach to public relations with that of Frank Taaffe.  The conversation also touched upon the specifics of the Twin Lakes community and its crime rate.

A “Worst of 2013” segment featured Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris (*Breaking Bad*), who discussed the show's ending, their on-screen relationship, and their experiences working together, employing frequent strong language, including the word "fuck" and other expletives.  Brandt's use of bubble wrap was also a recurring element.  The show concluded with a farewell for interns Sidney and Jackie, featuring cake, balloons, and expressions of appreciation.  A phone call with Black Earl Douglas was also included, where Douglas provided commentary on the late Lou Reed's musical influence.  The farewell for Sydney was extended in a subsequent segment,  featuring a live performance by Ryan Starr, serenading Jackie.  This segment also revisited the hosts' treatment of interns, contrasting the current celebratory atmosphere with previous, less-appreciative experiences.  Further discussion centered on the impending departure of Gary, a member of the show's management team, who was rumored to be moving to the finance department, leading to playful teasing.  The show ended with more farewells, reflections on both interns,  and several audio advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I then developed some smaller issues further down my left side to the left of my breast area.  And then those have started to go away, but it's still left with small nodules in my armpit.  And I'm just wondering what it is.  Okay.  We're about out of time.  We've got about 30 seconds.  So these, most likely a furuncle, which is a group of carbuncles, which are basically infected hair glands. 
[00:00:30]  That's a very likely thing that this could be.  If they're spreading, though, then he may be moving the infection from one place to the other.

[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he took a 5% pay cut because that's what other government workers were losing due to the recent sequester.  Well, you know that's peanuts for him, right?  I mean, he gets paid a pretty hefty salary as president, but did you know that he also makes an additional $72,000 on average per month on the side?  Wait, President Obama collects money from something other than his job?  Crazy, right?  Where's all this extra cash coming from?  Well, last week I came across a website called SecretIncome8.com, which explained exactly where the money comes from. 
[00:05:00]  But the cool thing is, it also shows how guys like you and me can rake in thousands of dollars every month by taking advantage of essentially the same income secret Obama uses.

Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Worst.  No.  Welcome to day seven of the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:10:30]  My name is Iraq.  The Opie and Anthony Show will return live on January 6th, 2014.  6 a.m.  I know a lot of you have been complaining, this vacation's going on too long.  Well, it's tough shit.  We need a break, too.  We're back.  January 6th, 2014.  Be there.  And then you won't miss anything.  Okay?  On today's show, we've got a lot of cool stuff involving Metallica, the brother of George  Zimmerman, Robert Zimmerman in studio, talking about the Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case.  We look at Mike Francesa and what he's done this year. 
[00:11:00]  And we're saying goodbye to a lot of things, which is appropriate because it is the last  day of 2013.  We say goodbye to Breaking Bad.  We say goodbye to Gus and Elmer, Lou Reed, some of our interns, and some of our management,  all of which have left us in the year of 2013.  But for right now, we're going to start off with Metallica.  And this segment involves Roland and Metallica.  SiriusXM was coming up on releasing some info for a big subscriber event, and they usually  do this time to time.  The event wound up being Metallica at the Apollo, which we all know.  So, but at the time of this discussion, Opie and Anthony talked about it on the air, but 
[00:11:30]  Roland didn't think that we were supposed to give this information out.  We found out it was on every website.  Metallica's website even had it.  But Roland didn't know this.  How does Roland react to this?  We find out.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  By the way, oh, see, seeing him live, are we going to get to go to the big fucking gig  that's coming up at the Apollo?  I would hope so.  I'm sure we will.  I'm sure we will.  I want to see that fucking thing.  Can we talk about what gig?  We're allowed to announce it, aren't we? 
[00:12:00]  I saw it somewhere.  Metallica.  Metallica at the Apollo.  What is that about?  Metallica at the Apollo Theater.  Are you serious?  I know.  I want to go.  When is that going down?  In September.  In September.  Oh, we're so there.  We better be.  Of course we're there.  But that'd be.  I think so.  I don't think they would.  Now that we're company guys, we're going to be there.  Very exciting.  I'm calling it. 
[00:12:30]  It's Metallica Day.  No.  Yeah, we really should.  With the big announcement.  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  No, no.  No.  There was a big.  No, no, no, no, no.  There was no announcement.  There was no announcement.  I heard that last thing.  There was no announcement.  Big announcement.  No.  I heard from a very reliable source.  I don't know what source you could have heard that from.  Roland.  No.  No.  Why would you say his name?  What? 
[00:13:00]  You did.  Roland does not want you talking about Metallica playing the Apollo.  Stop saying that.  Why?  I don't know.  He doesn't want it.  I don't know.  What?  Has he been in communicate?  He's been texting me.  He's been texting?  Why is he panicking?  Why is he panicking?  Metallica's playing the Apollo.  Yeah.  When is it?  September?  September.  September, yeah.  21st.  Fuck it.  Someone's got to announce this shit.  Yeah, but is there a big announcement that was supposed to happen today?  I believe at 10 a.m.  Where?  At probably one of the rock channels. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  Why would they give us that?  Why wouldn't they give us that scoop?  So.  I don't know.  Because most of it.  There's probably more Metallica fans listening to where they play Metallica.  What's going to be announced at 10 a.m.?  We have more fans listening here than they do on fucking other stations.  We have a shitload of fans.  And there's a lot of Metallica fans.  Yeah.  A bevy, I might say.  Holy fuck.  Heavy metal talk.  Winston Schumann wasn't running around telling everybody.  Yeah.  Maybe we don't know.  Is he panicking?  Roland.  Why is he panicking? 
[00:14:00]  Roland is in full panic mode.  Why?  He's beyond panicking.  Full panic mode.  Because.  We announced Metallica's playing the Apollo during our first break.  Yeah.  And now we've turned this into Metallica Day.  What's wrong with that?  Roland says it's still a rumor.  What?  Who cares that at 10 o'clock they're making the official announcement when we can make it now?  It's not the rumor.  And I know a little bit about radio.  7.30, a lot of people are listening to their radio.  Absolutely.  So this is the perfect time to do an announcement.  To snatch it.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  10 o'clock, everyone's at work.  No one's hearing the big announcement.  No one gives a turkey.  7.30 is when you make the big announcements.  Metallica, Apollo Theater, what day?  Sam?  Well, it's September 21st.  September 21st.  Cool.  I can't wait.  Me neither.  I better get tickets.  Yeah.  I hope we get tickets to see it front row.  Yes, we better.  We saw that Bruce thing there.  Saw Paul McCartney there.  That's right.  That was pretty amazing.  And to see Metallica at the Apollo would be fucking cool as shit.  Metallica to rock the Apollo Theater. 
[00:15:00]  I think this was private information.  What?  I think it was private information.  Until Roland told everybody.  Roland's got his ear to the ground, brother.  He knows shit.  And I appreciate that he fucking passes that shit on to us.  How long is the delay before Roland hears this and starts texting and losing his mind?  I don't know.  Let me tell you.  Why is he losing his mind?  He has to be.  This is what we do.  He is in full panic.  We blow up people's spots.  He was texting everybody, requesting certain statements be removed from replays. 
[00:15:30]  Now, why would you remove it from the broadcast if this announcement is supposed to be at 10 a.m.?  Right.  Why take it out of the replay then?  Because it will already be announced.  Right.  So why?  I don't understand that part of it.  He doesn't want any responsibility.  And I'm sorry.  I also don't understand why he's freaking out.  Yeah.  What has he written yet?  Who is he writing?  I asked him if it was bad if they say it again, since they already did.  Right.  And he said, yes, super bad. 
[00:16:00]  Why?  Super bad?  And then what did you write?  I'll take the bad movie.  He said, the rumor is the Apollo.  The venue can change.  I said, so it's only a rumor so far?  Not reported?  Right.  And he said, yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And then what?  Well, the rumor is the Apollo theater.  My mistake, then.  And then what happened?  Who'd you hear the rumor from?  Huh?  Roland?  Yeah, we shouldn't do it anymore to cover us.  Huh?  What happened?  Oh, we got to cover our asses?  Are we covering asses here?  We don't have to cover our asses. 
[00:16:30]  I think he's in route because my last message is not showing up.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's yelling.  He's in the front car of the train going, can you go faster, please?  Faster.  Push, push, push.  I got down there.  That's Metallica.  I got to get there.  I got to go faster.  Could you go faster, please?  I have a text from Roland earlier.  They were saying, they haven't signed, tell Jimmy in his ear to stop.  Tell him in his ear, like in the middle of the break.  Oh, my God.  Eric, did you imagine that?  No, I did not.  Come on, Jimmy, please.  Don't shut up. 
[00:17:00]  Jimmy, don't say it.  Don't say it.  And then, can you cut that out of the replay, please?  Hello?  Cut that out of the replay.  Oh, my God.  He's panicking.  He is freaking out.  He told me, he said, I told Eric to cut that out of the replay.  I said, do you think we should?  He said, yes, God, yes.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's going to come in here.  We got to lock the door.  Like a fucking monster.  No, I think it'll be the exact opposite.  I think he'll come in defeated and sad.  Do you think he'll cry?  No.  You don't worry about it.  He's going to go straight to the boss's office. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, you think?  What he wrote was pretty good.  Metallica's show hasn't been announced.  Please, please don't say it again.  Please, please.  I might get murder now.  Telling, telling.  That's why yesterday I said it's secret.  He wrote you?  Yeah.  Oh, that's got this part, too.  Oh.  It was after where he said, tell it to me and he's here to stop.  And he goes, he wrote in big letters, secret.  And then it says, Jesus, why? 
[00:18:00]  He only told you yesterday?  Oh, the poor guy is going to fucking lose his mind.  We've got to lock the door.  We have to.  He's freaking out right now.  He's very scary.  We should not be talking about this.  Apollo Theater, Metallica, September 21st.  Oh, no.  I think that's correct, but I wish you wouldn't bring it up anymore.  You could murder Roland by saying that.  And knowing how the company works, I'm sure there will be about ten seats for actual fans.  Depending on celebrity involvement. 
[00:18:30]  I think there will be ten spots for the fans, and the rest of the Apollo Theater will be filled with celebrities.  With who's who.  Like Tom Hanks.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Do you think they'll hold back a pair of tickets to Lotto to the employees?  Oh, maybe bring a stripper or a tranny?  Well, I don't know.  Huh.  This is exciting news.  It really is.  I can't wait.  It's not news.  No.  Ten o'clock, it'll be official?  It's a secret. 
[00:19:00]  Until ten.  Is it a secret or a rumor until ten?  Some people can't keep secrets, can they?  Who are you talking about?  I don't think it's a secret anymore.  So, I guess.  Lose lipsync ships?  It's a rumor, I guess, officially, right?  Well, you have announced it as fact that you guys are a trusted source of information.  Oh, no.  This is happening.  Lose lipsync ships.  This is happening, and it'll be official at ten o'clock.  According to Roland, it's still a rumor.  How could it be a rumor, like, this close to ten?  No one's signed.  They're not up at this hour still signing contracts. 
[00:19:30]  The acre's dry.  Oh, please.  This is going down.  No, no.  Don't say anything.  All right.  No, don't say anything.  Fuck, man.  It's all good, right?  Poor Roland.  Oh, man.  He's got to be en route.  He's got to be.  Could you go a little faster, please?  Please.  You got to go faster.  Could we not stop at 50 Light Street?  According to some text messages, this could indeed be the last Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no. 
[00:20:00]  Because you guys chose to make that announcement.  Wow.  Is that from, who's that from?  I mean, based on the information we've gotten, there could be murders.  Murder.  Because of.  I love that one.  Why?  Because of this announcement that you guys chose to make.  And I love the other one.  Was it Jesus Why?  Yeah.  Jesus Why.  Jesus Why.  Can you imagine living that tortured life?  That's what you say when you're given a terminal diagnosis.  That's what the girl said after her fucking foot got cut off by that road cam. 
[00:20:30]  That's what you say when you realize you've lost a foot.  Not when you announce a Metallica show at the Apollo Theater.  How cool is that?  I can't wait to fucking see that, man.  That is cool.  That's going to be great.  I hope we get tickets.  We're definitely going.  I hope you guys don't get suspended for like a week and two days. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, oh, oh, I wonder if, uh, look out.  I hope some of us don't get suspended for one day longer.  Uh-oh, well, you know what?  We're hearing from the bosses and we might just get suspended.  Nah, we'll be here tomorrow.  Don't worry.  Yeah, don't worry.  Everything's good.  Yeah.  Of course.  I got a great fucking idea.  Oh, yeah?  Could you mute the mics?  All right, they're muted.  Yeah?  Let's actually install some fucking tickets. 
[00:21:30]  I'll pretend I broke into the boss's office.  All right.  I'll just come back in.  It made sense at the time.  No, but I'll come in and I'll go like, what the fuck?  I broke into the boss's office and you guys go, chip off.  Although I like that Roland is now playing up that in the reality thing.  The bosses don't want us announcing this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just heard back from him.  Okay.  What did he say?  What did he say?  I said they're talking about it again.  He said, why?  I'm in the subway. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, no.  I wish he was in here.  Well, the why is because they're very excited.  They're very excited.  They're big Metallica fans.  And they couldn't help themselves.  Let him know.  Very excited.  They were asked, how did they get this information?  And they announced on the air that Roland did indeed.  They said you told them.  Oh, Jesus.  Roland Campos presents.  Oh, poor Roland.  Let's go.  No, don't say that.  Don't tell him that while he's in the subway.  Wait till he's away from the train.  Oh, he's going to jump on the tracks. 
[00:22:30]  He's writing back.  I already sent it.  He's writing back?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I said they're very excited.  They said you told them.  Oh, no.  I texted, oh, he needs 12 tickets.  He's texting.  He said, I told Jimmy it's a secret.  Great.  Secret.  He's having a terrible movie.  And Anthony is the one who said it.  Exactly.  I didn't even.  It's not for air.  It's not for air.  Whoops.  I'm telling him I think it's okay. 
[00:23:00]  He's having a lousy morning.  No, no, no.  Just write back.  Oops.  Oops.  Right back.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Whatever.  The guys say it's one of those things.  Yeah.  Shit happens.  Shit happens.  Yeah.  You know the guys.  Boys will be boys.  Yeah.  I think he's.  Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, there's been an emergency on the subway line.  We're going to need you to get off, and we will supply bus transportation. 
[00:23:30]  A gentleman has thrown himself in front of the subway car.  He's fine, but the train is broken.  Is he riding back?  No, he's back underground.  Oh, no.  He'll pass it for the east.  Please skip this.  He probably stopped at a station that has, you know, cell service.  Oh, so he can listen.  Oh, he's typing right now, and he sees, like, no cell service.  The delay is crazy long.  Right.  So he might actually hear the entire break. 
[00:24:00]  There's going to be, like, at AAF when the news guy popped out and caught you guys in the elevator.  Yes.  The news guy's going to pop out and say, how do you feel?  Your talent booker threw himself in front of a train because you announced a concert.  We go about, look, we apologize to Roland and his family.  And then Opie will go, I didn't even know the conductor was a fan.  And then that stupid laugh afterwards.  Oh, God.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What, what, what?  I don't know.  What, what?  Yeah.  I mean, Roland, he's got to relax. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, man.  I don't know.  It's all good.  You sold him out.  The Apollo.  That's a, man.  That's a secret.  A secret is the word that.  Because to see fucking Paul McCartney there was amazing.  Springsteen.  Even Bruce, like, and I'm not a Bruce fan, but to see him there, the energy that, somehow  it just energizes the performers.  Now, to see Metallica at the Apollo Theater.  Oh, I can't wait. 
[00:25:00]  On September 21st will be amazing.  Why do you keep bringing it out?  What?  It's a secret.  What are they going to do?  I wonder.  That big a secret.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  I don't close with that.  Ride lightning.  But at this point, it can't be a secret, so we might as well keep talking about it.  Yeah, why not?  We said it, we said it.  Yeah, we said it.  Fuck it.  Right?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do, man?  I'll just be, uh...  Jim's nonchalant shrug.  After we said it, we said it.  I mean, what are you going to...  Yeah, it is what it is, right?  I'm going to tell Roland, sorry.  I guess it's, uh, sad but true. 
[00:25:30]  Nice.  That they'll be, uh, playing there, Roland.  Sorry we announced it.  Yeah, looks like the Sandman entered.  Hmm?  Yeah.  Jim, they might need an opener.  Fuck yeah.  Maybe I will.  Sick fucking puppies, man.  That'd be cool.  Everything sounds like...  Horrible guitar sound. 
[00:26:00]  You don't think they would get cheered in front of Metallica?  Oh my god.  You think people would want Metallica on as soon as possible?  Yeah.  And by the way, I know you guys may not have enjoyed, uh, We're Cutting the Cheese.  Oh god.  But somebody's manager can't stop singing it.  Oh no.  Oh really?  Somebody's manager has been standing in front of the TV and singing it while his wife is  trying to watch it.  Jonathan is nuts.  He is nuts.  And, um, apparently, uh, even created his own opera version. 
[00:26:30]  That's what I've heard.  Yeah.  Do we have it?  No.  That's crazy.  Yeah, but it's, uh, it's not good.  Text message.  Oh no.  Roland.  Oh.  What's he saying?  How's Roland doing?  Where is he?  What is he saying?  Almost here?  I said, I said, I think it's okay, but hey, what are you going to do?  You know them.  And he said, yeah, I thought Jimmy would.  He loves them.  I don't know what that means.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really thinks I blew it.  So he's accepting it. 
[00:27:00]  They're all very excited.  Roland thinks that I blew it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Because he trusted me and I would, I never would have blabbed it.  You didn't blab it.  But no.  Should we pump it up and say that Scott Greenstein's waiting outside the studio to talk to us?  Well, you said, no, Scott's been in communication.  Like, Scott's pissed.  Pump it up.  Just let him know management doesn't seem happy.  Should we pump it up?  Yeah.  Management's not happening.  No, you ask him, did you clear this with Scott?  Because he's, he's been.  He said, kill me.  He's so bummed.  Say, uh, Scott wants to talk to us, uh, during the next parade. 
[00:27:30]  He does not handle work-related pressure.  No.  Well, at all.  At all.  He handles it.  Fucking, fucking Major Hassan handled it better than Fort Hood.  Fucking Roland handles it.  Oh, my God.  Poor guy.  See what he says to that.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  My child, I go.  It was delivered, so we'll see.  All right, we'll see what he says.  Aw.  Hate.  I'm your hate.  God, I can't wait to see it.  I'm your hate when you won't lose.  Pay. 
[00:28:00]  Pay the price.  Pay for nothing.  You think they're going to play the hits?  They better play the fucking hits.  Well, they're promoting their movies, so they don't even have a lot of new songs.  I mean, because they're promoting a film.  No, they don't have, yeah.  It's just insensitive of you guys to get further on.  Yeah.  Even for the people just tuning in now, you're still making the announcement based on exclusive  information given solely to you guys.  Yeah.  By Roland.  Roland, as we discussed.  Roland.  Well, what are you going to do? 
[00:28:30]  Roland gave you the facts, huh?  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  Because then you could come in and make the announcement.  You could come in and say it and be all excited about it.  People are excited.  What's this fucking 7.30, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, noon?  Who cares?  And now you have a one-up on everyone requesting tickets.  Exactly.  You knew before everyone.  We say right away, we need tickets to this amazing event.  Metallica, the Apollo.  Yeah, I can't wait for the Apollo Theater show.  It'd be great. 
[00:29:00]  Those shows are so cool.  I got a lot of da-da-da-da-da.  We're the four horsemen.  Oh, jeez.  I hope we get the guys in.  I mean, they're...  Now we want to get this.  No, now we can't.  Is he running back?  No.  Oh.  I don't know where he is.  Uh, his phone is going right to voicemail now.  It's...  It's just laying on the third rail.  Yeah.  Fizzling.  Yeah.  Fuck it. 
[00:29:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I know, I'm not saying anything, but...  What?  That's great.  Come on.  Ah, well.  We'll give away the punchline in that year.  Ha, ha, ha, Roland.  Oh, boy.  This is not going to be good for Roland.  No.  It's not confirmed, though.  Nope.  No.  That's why I'm saying it's going to be good.  Yeah.  Hi-oh.  That'd be crazy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Did he just text again?  Well, I told him that Scott wants to talk to you guys, and he said, great, I am fired. 
[00:30:00]  Do you want him to come in when he gets here?  Why is this funny to us?  Hold on, let me write.  I mean, anyway.  What are you going to write?  There's a good chance that that could happen.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm going to write him back to make him feel better.  Oh, I'm sure.  To make him feel better.  What did you say?  Dude, chill.  He'll probably appreciate it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, don't worry.  You told me to chill.  Right.  Everything's fine.  I'll just chillax in the meantime. 
[00:30:30]  Have you checked your Twitter?  No.  Everyone is...  Can we give away the punchline now, or...?  No.  No.  No.  No, no.  Wait for Roly.  Wait for Ro-Ro?  Do you want him to come in when he gets there?  He's on 42nd right now.  Of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right here.  Yeah.  Jimmy told me to chill out.  Everybody except for Roly is probably aware of the punchline, but...  Yeah.  Can you come in right when you...  And also, right, right, things are getting pretty heated. 
[00:31:00]  Things are getting heated.  Yeah.  Yeah, tell him to come straight to the studio.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I did.  Oh.  Oh, this poor boy.  Poor little Roland.  Oh, my God.  Poor Roland.  You told me to chill out.  Tell Roland we made ABC News.  You want it?  Yes.  Tell him...  Tell him that...  I swear to God, they just posted this 14 minutes ago.  ABC News is picking up on us, talking about it, and they just put it on their website. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, Roland.  All right.  I mean, that's not a lie.  ABC News has picked it up.  Oh.  It says the headline...  Tell him the headline says, Metallica set the headline, legendary venue.  Oh.  And then write, oh, no, after it.  Posted 14 minutes ago.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Posted 14 minutes ago.  I wrote, ugh.  Yeah.  Did you write that?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Can you come in right when you get here?  Things are getting heated. 
[00:32:00]  ABC News has picked it up.  Ugh.  Right.  Oh, he thinks he's so fired.  Poor boy.  You writing to him?  Yeah.  What?  What are you telling him now, Jimmy?  Seriously.  Chill.  No, I wrote something.  Dude, it's exciting.  Exclamation point.  This is so fucking mean.  He's our friend.  Oh, he's like a little puppy.  It's a terrible work environment.  He's a panda.  Sal, are we getting the panda angry? 
[00:32:30]  Don't get the panda angry!  And then there's the panda.  Listen to the panda.  Listen to the...  Wait, wait.  There we go.  I love right to the end.  Yeah.  It's a lion.  It's a lion, right?  It's not telling the truth.  Oh, oof.  Sorry, guys.  It's a little levity.  Good one, Sal.  I miss the girls.  You do?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  What were their names?  What?  Jackie and fucking...  What's her name?  No.  Yeah.  It's, of course, Sydney.  The, um...  I just miss, you know, coming in the door and getting a...  Good morning!  Yeah.  I know.  From the...  I waved to you today.  The playroom.  Yeah, exactly.  From the playroom.  Exactly.  The playroom.  From summer camp office.  Oh, Roland's here.  Yes, Roland.  Oh, boy.  How's Roland?  Oh, no.  How's he walking out?  That's cool, though.  Roland. 
[00:33:30]  Roland.  Yes.  How was your commute?  Oh, fantastic.  TMZ just picked it up.  What?  Yeah.  We're on TMZ.  That's fucking awesome.  Well, awesome.  Congratulations.  What happened?  It's exciting.  I'm going to text Troy, see if he wants to beach me today.  Why?  What do you mean?  You think you're in trouble?  Come on.  Well, you think there's some level of professionalism when we say don't see anything.  Oh, no.  Roland. 
[00:34:00]  And I love you at all.  It's just...  But we're getting our names out there.  Just hit Google.  Google News.  Google News.  Yeah.  Should I look it up?  Oh, fantastic.  Show them the ABC headline.  That's the best one.  Oh, wow.  Who told you that this has to be kept quiet?  Metallica sets a headline legendary.  Oh, shit.  ABC News.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Oh.  Who told?  Who told?  And this is just like a fun thing that they're adding.  And while Apollo is known for its Sandman character, enter Sandman as one of Metallica's famous 
[00:34:30]  songs.  I did not know that.  That's a little fun.  Yeah.  Roland.  Yes, sir.  Who said that this really has to be kept quiet?  Well, you just always get the sense of secrets.  Like when you guys talk here and you guys look at us, we're like, okay, that information  should be kept quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This one, it was tough to keep quiet, though.  I didn't know that.  And then that's why I said that when Jim was concerned about like, what about this?  I go, don't worry.  We're taking care of this, this, and this for you. 
[00:35:00]  Everything will be taken care of.  So we're going to get tickets?  You think we'll get tickets?  Yay.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And I emailed the guy.  He's calling them today to talk to them.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So it's confirmed?  This one was a little too exciting.  Metallica?  I don't know.  Apollo Theater confirmed?  Is it confirmed?  I guess you guys take care of the PR department work.  We go home.  Mission accomplished.  That's what we do if we do Mars' job. 
[00:35:30]  Everyone's thanking us on Twitter.  That big stump is probably Hillary.  She passed out.  Why do you think you're in trouble here?  I don't know.  You know how this place works.  It's like, you're on the air, you talk, and they go, oh, it's fine.  And then you hear other things like, oh, well, you're not on the air.  And if we could speak, before you got here, I mean, you did, you said on the air that  you got the information from Roland.  I got my information from Sam.  So I just heard about it just now. 
[00:36:00]  Well, everybody pretty much heard from Roland.  See, that's why he thinks.  I thought it's exciting.  It's very exciting.  I don't know.  It's another one of these legendary performers at a legendary venue.  I guess if you're a fan, it'll be, woo-hoo.  Roland.  Now the show's making some headlines.  Roland.  Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  Yeah, we're cool.  We'll be all right.  All right.  We'll get you through this one. 
[00:36:30]  Yay.  At least they're all on vacation today.  Who, Metallica?  No, they're all on vacation today.  The Apollo.  Oh, management.  Management's on vacation?  Manegiomente.  All of them?  I think the ones who yell are.  The ones who yell.  Oh, man.  There's already a fucking...  You guys were right.  It is exciting. 
[00:37:00]  Thanks, Rolandas99.  Oh, that's so mean.  You're being credited.  That's kind of cool, Roland.  Somebody made a photo of Metallica, and on top it says Metallica at the Apollo 921, and  on the bottom it says thanks at Rolando's 99.  Yeah.  Which is Roland's Twitter handle.  Yeah.  Last time this happened, the guy's running for president now.  Christy.  Oh, and I see this.  Oh, right, right, right. 
[00:37:30]  I remember that.  It had been flashbacks.  And that had to do with the Apollo Theater.  Right.  Yeah.  No, that was the garden.  Okay, the garden.  Right, right.  Oh, I forgot about that.  But still, though, I didn't think he was going to come run for president.  My bad.  Are you going to go?  Where?  Metallica.  No, thank you.  Apollo Theater.  No, I'd rather have a fan go.  September 21st.  I'd rather have a fan go than...  What?  You don't want to see Metallica?  No.  Why?  I have no interest.  Then why would you announce this?  I'm not announcing it.  It just was...  Why would you announce this to everybody if you don't even care about that man?  Because you were worried about the thumb bookings. 
[00:38:00]  I said, don't worry, we're working there.  Oh, cool.  Because Roland told Jimmy...  I didn't say nothing.  And then Jimmy told Jimmy...  In confidence, though, I think.  ...me.  No, he didn't say anything about the...  Yeah, we didn't know.  ...secret.  Oh.  Oh, me.  I just heard...  You gotta blame Jimmy.  I was like, get the fuck out of here.  And he goes, no, Roland, you know, it's probably good information.  And it was, apparently.  I guess.  Are they...  And we're desperate for attention over here, so we've said, fuck it, let's do this. 
[00:38:30]  Is it all signed?  I don't know.  Venue secured?  Let's ask the...  Because I hear tell, maybe the venue not secured yet.  Oh, boy.  Let's ask our new reporter, Mr. Greg Hughes.  Hey.  Why are you panicking?  You are freaking out, Roland.  This is the hell that is my life.  Oh, my God.  What?  Everybody's good.  Everybody's psyched about it. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yay.  It's only good news, right?  It's all good, right?  It is.  Until the wizard comes.  I can't imagine this would actually be a problem.  No worries.  Right?  Hopefully the wizard gets stuck in that subway.  Please, Jesus.  Do your magic.  We saw your tsunamis.  What did we do?  We saw your tsunamis?  Oh.  I didn't say stuck in the subway.  Yeah.  It does seem like sensitive information.  Was it, though? 
[00:39:30]  How sensitive was this?  Scale of one to ten.  Ten being, like, fucking...  I heard other people yapping a lot in the hallways, so...  Yeah.  Fuck them and bring them all down.  Wow.  Hallways are a little different than on air, though.  Especially on this giant show.  Yeah.  According to HR, too.  That's what they said.  Yeah.  Y'all...  Y'all...  That's great.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We should go to break, I guess.  Yay.  Oof. 
[00:40:00]  It's going to be awkward.  Yeah.  When we're off the air.  Are you going to yell at us when we're off the air?  Or are we just crawling to the table and take a shit and just walk right out?  I don't want to go to break.  I know.  It's all fun when we're talking into the mic, and then you go to break, and we've got  to look at Roland and...  Yeah.  Like a real person?  Yeah.  Do we put you down?  What?  Did we?  We didn't let you down, did we?  Let's rewind the history of the show.  It's fun.  It's one of the bumps, as we say. 
[00:40:30]  Jesus.  I feel bad now.  Yeah.  That happens.  What are you going to do, right?  Yeah, you know.  We should be good.  Let's see more dicks in the ass.  You think this is a dick in the ass situation?  No.  This is probably like a Puerto Rican dick in the ass.  It's a little bit bigger than others.  Oh, wow.  Gee.  Thanks for the fan who made that.  Like, yeah, yeah.  You leaving some nasty comments on his Instagram later?  I'm going to find his children picture and post them. 
[00:41:00]  Ah, that is a good one.  I'm going to find out where he works and then shit on him and his company.  That's one of my favorite things to do, by the way, is find the pictures of their kids.  Yeah.  When somebody really fucks with you on Twitter, you just fucking dig, dig, dig into their Instagram,  into their fucking...  You look way early on in their Twitter account.  You have to keep going back, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You got to keep going.  But you go, like, years back, because when they originally got Twitter, that's when people  post the most pictures, you know, because they're all excited and shit. 
[00:41:30]  And that's where you find their pictures.  And then you go, wow, what a fucking cross-eyed looking dork kid you have.  And then they cancel their account.  Well, I'm going to call me a fag on Instagram.  His wife says, fag, can your wife join me for the biggest loser?  That fat whore.  What?  Wow, we were keeping it fun.  Whoa, whoa.  Take it a little too far.  Look at his eyes.  They're a little crazy.  But the wife is good, too.  You go after the wife, girlfriend, fucking anything.  Yes.  Go for the throat.  They hear your feelings.  Right? 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  We were just doing good, exciting news today.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  The news is Metallica, the Apollo Theater, thanks to Roland, September 21st.  Confirmed as per Rolando's 99.  So you can thank him on Twitter.  Hey, fans.  Enjoy.  Oh, God.  He's freaking out.  Why are you freaking out?  I don't know.  Enough with the secrecy around here.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  If we got info, we're going to fucking say it to the people. 
[00:42:30]  Transparency.  Yeah, why wait until 10 o'clock?  That's right.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, what's so special about 10 o'clock?  Who cares you got this info illegally?  We're fucking going to talk about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're part of the story.  We're going to get some hits, boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, sweet Jesus.  Riding.  Riding.  Oh, no.  Now Edgar's fucking molesting him.  Do your duty and stop talking about Malika. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, Malika.  What the fuck?  All right.  Good.  Oh, Rolly.  So now they don't have to make the announcement at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  You save them time, paperwork, and all that stuff.  What else are they going to talk about?  Like the fucking, what, there's a channel?  No, the special opener.  Oh.  I'm just kidding.  I don't know.  There's a Metallica channel?  I don't know.  That's going to be kicking up?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know in serious.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  No, that's pretty cool, though.  Yeah, it is very cool.  I would think.  I'll listen to that.  I'll fucking listen to that in a second. 
[00:43:30]  Or listen to the Bruce channel.  Wow.  She's the one I played today for you.  The Metallica channel thing was probably part of the big announcement that was supposed  to be made later.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think that's been recorded.  That probably came from Sam.  Oh, boy.  You're an ass, Sam.  I don't know.  I think, as I said, this is all news to me.  Yes, Sam.  Oh, gosh.  You winked at me.  You all right, Roland?  No, I should be all right.  This is serious, Sam.  At least we got to get health insurance.  Oh.  So I can go tell the doctor, remove the dick. 
[00:44:00]  You think this is a dick-in-the-ass situation?  I think so.  I think he thinks that.  I don't think it is.  How big, though?  Chill.  Is that a Puerto Rican?  Just chill, dude.  Puerto Rican dick-in-the-ass.  Yeah.  Like a Poe.  Did you get Jim's text to just chill?  Yeah, but you always say it's just chill all the time when I go freak out.  Yeah, why aren't you chilling?  If Jim says, just chill, that should be good enough.  It's all good.  Vacation's coming.  I get that from all these guys.  And when things hit the fan, they're like, ah, don't worry. 
[00:44:30]  And should we cut this from the replay?  Well, I would.  It's too late.  Yeah, but now it's not just an announcement.  Yeah, now it's a giant segment.  The replay's going to be short.  It's already on fucking YouTube, probably.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking about taking a sick day today and just fucking just get wasted.  Fucking zoot it.  Yeah.  A little zootage.  Yeah, zootage.  That's like a nice morning shit and everything.  Yeah, zootage.  It was good.  The entire thing, he texted me and it was ruined. 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  It's ruined.  This ruined your morning shit?  Yes.  That I'm sorry about.  That is bad.  Well, how many people knew about this?  Probably now.  Check your Twitter.  No, I know.  I mean, the Twitter's exploded.  People are very excited about Metallica at the Apollo Theater, September 21st, thanks  to Roland.  And the new Metallica channel.  Right.  That's going to be launching here on SiriusXM.  What?  Mandatory Metallica.  Mandatory Metallica.  Are we doing Mandatory Metallica?  That's the name of the channel.  Nice.  Yay. 
[00:45:30]  That's the name of the channel.  Mandatory Metallica.  Wow.  Where'd you hear that?  That's sweet.  Roland.  Wow.  Roland.  Why would you?  You guys got my email?  Awesome.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is scary, Roland.  I hate this version of Roland.  I know.  It's not fun.  It's scary, Roland.  No one wants to go to break.  Nothing.  Gosh.  It'll be all right.  It'll be fine.  Don't sweat it.  We'll try to talk to the bosses today.  I checked it.  I got to leave right away. 
[00:46:00]  Well, I mean, you got to leave right here.  Talk to the bosses.  If they want to meet us in the elevator, that's cool.  Or maybe if you, I want to, I don't want to overset my boundaries, maybe if you guys  could Skype in for me.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  I can't take this.  Oh.  I feel bad, Roland.  Yeah.  It's got to suck to be in the know like you are.  You know, and then we have to do what we do.  But he's never going to tell us anything again. 
[00:46:30]  But we have to.  Why do you have to?  I was so psyched to hear this yesterday.  I know.  Absolutely.  Run onto the radio and talk about it, right?  Had good dreams of me running around, chocolate fountains.  And then you woke up to this.  There's shit everywhere.  That's ironic.  I'm just not looking at anyone.  The chocolate fountains, now there's shit everywhere.  Never free, never me.  Yeah.  Say it about true.  I'm unforgiven.  I hope we don't remain unforgiven.  Yes. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if I get yelled at.  Why would you get yelled at?  Yeah.  They like meetings here.  You told us something.  And you go, can I see for three seconds?  And you go, oh.  Look, you told us something.  We couldn't help ourselves.  That's so.  The beans.  Wouldn't we be in trouble?  You know.  You don't have a radio show.  They're free.  They're free to view.  No.  That's true.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah.  I love that.  Once they hear the dean and the elevator close, they're like, oh, we need to see you for a minute.  I'm like, oh.  Oh, and then they'll take it out on you?  Of course. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, man.  Well, we won't allow that.  Management 101, Chapter 4.  Yeah.  Dicks in the ass.  We will not allow that, and we'll stay behind you 100%.  Do you have my Escalade number for when I'm driving home?  I do.  If you need it.  No.  I'll slice your tires.  Oh, shit.  Here it comes.  The scary rolling.  Here it comes.  Run away, man.  Oh.  It's in my blood.  Oh.  Yeah, you can't go to break.  Why?  No, this is scary. 
[00:48:00]  No, because there will be venom at the break.  Come on, Roland.  Now we're all having a good time.  He just starts choking people out.  No, I'll just bite Sam.  Oh.  Why do you bite me?  You always take your anger out on me.  Yeah.  Should, uh, maybe Roland should leave the studio before we go to break, because I'm a little  scared of you.  Yeah.  Don't forget, people.  Apollo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  You should have more excitement.

I'm like, oh, by the way,  anyone hear about this Metallica thing  at the Apollo?  I heard about it on Twitter last night.  Well, all these three assholes  were texting me.  Dude, Scott wants to talk to you.

Opie and Anthony's  Worsley 2013  continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  Worsley 2013  Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock  and we continue  talking about Metallica  in this segment here  involving Jim Norton  trying to get a photo.  Metallica's at SiriusXM  but they're not here  for our show. 
[00:58:00]  Once again,  we're in that familiar scenario,  that old territory  of everyone being  on high alert  and as the show  comes to a screeching halt  until Jim Norton  can get his celebrity photo.  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  on the Opie and Anthony channel.  I would love to know  what's happening  down that fucking hallway.  Jimmy.  E-Rock,  you know?  No,  I don't.  I haven't been  going in here.  Go run  because we've got to leave.  There's a...  All right,  hang on.  I don't care.  We can handle this.  Just run real fast  and give us a really quick update 
[00:58:30]  because the people  want to know.  You're giving him  an impossible task.  Run real fast.  He just flipped the bird to me.  I thought he was  out of that studio.  If he goes fast,  he'll be back by 10.30.  I know.  Yeah,  Florentine...  Jim Norton got up,  then Florentine got up,  and then Sam took off,  I guess,  to record the tragedy.  I hope...  No,  I hope he gets it,  but there's part of me  that hopes he didn't get it.  We all are hoping  he didn't get it.  Yeah,  okay,  I'll be honest.  That's a solid hour 
[00:59:00]  of radio tomorrow.  He didn't get it,  and I'm hoping  it's for a reason  that...  Uh-oh.  Oh,  Sam,  what?  Sam walked in wincing.  Wincing.  Nothing's happened yet.  They're still in there.  Right.  It's looking not  100% right now.  Why?  Why?  Tell us what's going on.  Various people...  You guys all blew off  Tony Danza.  Poor Tony Danza.  We were talking about that  in the hall.  Half the room left.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  He's talking to various  people in management,  but a lot of people  have come up to him  and saying, 
[00:59:30]  we're going to try,  I just don't want  to be the bad guy  if...  Oh, no.  And we got a lot  of people coming out  all at once.  I don't know  if they're going  to be together.  When are they coming out?  Any minute?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm going to go  Do you understand  how impossible  it's going to be?  Hold on.  Before Sam runs away,  is Jimmy really pissed?  Yeah, he's really tense.  We're a little bit  spaced away from him  because I'm trying  to get an angle  in case there's  anything to preserve.  No, it's because you  don't want to be  around the energy  that's happening  right now.  Oh, my God.  Is he spiraling  out of control? 
[01:00:00]  I'm going to go  find out.  Is it a spiral?  Oh, yeah.  It's a spiral.  It's just getting  worse and worse.  It's ramping up,  spiraling down.  I will assume that...  Well, Sam will have  an update on the  after show.  I think this is  going to be a good  after show.  Was that Eric Banner  that was here?  I don't think so.  It looked like him.  Iraq?  I could have  seen when I saw him.  We did the meatball  thing already.  Yeah.  Bruce Banner.  Did he get an update?  Banner, Banner,  Banner, whatever his  name is.  Like Sam was saying,  he was running back.  There's a whole crowd  waiting around Howard's  door there because 
[01:00:30]  they got all their  equipment and everything.  Uh-huh.  Ain't going to happen.  Dude, do you know  what it would be like  to get those four guys?  They don't travel  around in a gaggle,  the whole band together,  unless they're doing  something.  So want to leave,  want to go to the  bathroom, do you think  they're going to be  able to get all four  of them together in front  of that thing to take  a picture with Jimmy?  It ain't going to happen.  All right, Lars,  you stay here, we'll  wait for James.  Do you think they'll  wait?  I've seen him try to  do it.  Try to line up like a  class trip.  Yeah, yeah, this ain't  going to happen.  Oh, my God.  Poor Jimmy.  It's going to be great 
[01:01:00]  for either the after  show or our show  tomorrow or both.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  He will lose his mind.  Poor Jimmy.  He has it in his  little heart that he's  getting this done.  Oh, Tony Danza,  I got to leave.  You didn't ask him  about the Bulls and  the Spider-Man.  No, I brought it up.  We were going there.  I brought it up.  He just didn't want to.  He's like, we were  going there.  I know exactly what  Dan was doing.  He was feeling the  water.  He put his toe in the  water.  With a little joke.  I thought that that  was a joke and he was  like, eh. 
[01:01:30]  And then he went on.  He moved on fast.  Yeah, yeah.  He did.  I was ready to say  that, you know, you're  sporing some good heat.  You think he's aware.  Some good heat?  Yeah.  I was ready, but then  he moved on really fast.  He did.  He put his toe in and  I'm like, all right, I'll  dive in.  Fuck it.  Do you think he's aware?  Of course he is.  That picture made it  everywhere.  Oh, about us?  About us.  And how brutal we were?  Oh, I don't think so.  Well, I told him about,  you know, how we would  goof on a show a little 
[01:02:00]  bit, but I didn't talk  about it.  I thought that was  brave.  I figured what the fuck.  That was kind of  brave.  You know, he seems like  he's got a sense of  humor, you know, a little  bit, but I liked him.  I hope he comes back.  I know.  I like Tony.  Then he looks great,  too.  You know, yeah, a little  gussied up, got a full  head of hair on him.  Don't look too old.  Yeah.  What were you saying  about Jimmy before you  interrupted and then I  interrupted him? 
[01:02:30]  I said, I think Jimmy's  going to be very  disappointed.  No, he's just not going  to get all of them  together.  It can't happen.  It can't.  If they were all in one  place, maybe.  If they were all  milling about in the  lobby area, he might be  able to.  But if they're coming  out one at a time to  leave, do you think  Jimmy's going to go,  could you wait here  while the rest of the  guys in the, he'd be  like, no, I'm going,  who are you?  You left Metallica a  little early.  As soon as the show  was over, Jimmy  absolutely enjoyed  himself.  We all enjoyed  ourselves, obviously. 
[01:03:00]  Uh-huh.  As soon as we left  the venue, he started  talking about Monday  and the group picture.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he didn't even  let the, I don't  know, the feelings that  he got from the  concert, like he...  Yeah, they instantly  turned negative.  He instantly just, yeah,  he instantly turned that  amazing experience off and  he was already on to,  okay, so Monday, all  right, I got...  And was going through  his whole fucking plan  with us. 
[01:03:30]  All weekend long, he  must have been thinking  about Monday.  Monday.  I was out with the  kids yesterday and I  happened to bump into  them.  That's when we were  doing the dumb air  guitar and shit.  Uh-huh.  His opening line was,  oh, on Monday, I'm  thinking, blah, blah,  blah, blah, and I'm  like, okay, all right.  He is going to be so  disappointed.  It's going to be  interesting tomorrow.  Tragic.  A little tease for  tomorrow's show.  Tragic.  All right.  We'll have a whole  list of people to  blame.  Yes, a whole list of  new assholes in this  place.  See, I...  I sort of explained 
[01:04:00]  on the show.  I guess we're doing  our own after show now.  But, Jimmy, I know  how serious this  picture-taking thing  is.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's no joke  whatsoever.  It's his thing.  Big time.  And he gets real...  We all know, because  we've all lived it.  But I know it's great  to needle him for the  show, but I'm also  scared, because if you  poke a little too  hard, he's going to  fucking...  He's going to turn  on you.  He is.  He'll bite.  So it's this fine  little balancing act,  because when you  needle him a little  bit just to get him 
[01:04:30]  going, it's too much  fun for the show.  But on a personal  level, because we're  friends off the air,  it's fucking brutal.  Because he takes it  so seriously.  E-Rock?  You guys brought up  earlier how Jim can't  just be happy getting  what he wants, because  then he thinks of the  next thing, and then  gets all upset again.  Exactly.  So if he does get  this photo, he'll be  happy for a moment, and  then he'll be upset  that they weren't on  the show.  So then he'll be  upset again.  So he'll just go  right back into that  place.  He'll only be happy,  though, if the photo is  good, because that's a 
[01:05:00]  whole thing, too.  It's not even good  enough that he got a  photo with this person  or group.  Now the photo has to  be good.  Then he's got to mail it  out to get signed.  Thank you.  And then it's not over  yet, because then his  new mission is to get the  whole band to sign the  photo he took with the  band.  He blew a head gasket  before, because the  photography place that he  gets his pictures from  forgot his Danza  picture, I guess.  Tony Danza picture.  And now we're in  trouble, because we  didn't get any of his  shit sign, because we  forgot.  Oh, shit. 
[01:05:30]  We're on the shit list.  Oh, we're on the shit  list.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, no, his book.  That's why the Tony  Danza book's there.  That's why Tony's like,  oh, my book.  That's Jimmy's Tony  Danza book, and he's  assuming we did the  right thing and had him  sign it.  So we're on the shit  list now.  Do you want to just  sign it for him?  I was going to say we  should just sign it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me the Sharpie.  All right.  Hold on.  Because we're on the  shit list, for sure.  No, he likes it on  the cover.  On the cover? 
[01:06:00]  No, no, no.  Don't put it on the  cover, because he does  like it on the cover.  All right.  Here.  Here.  It'll be two Jim  thoughts and prayers.  Yes.  And we'll even say we  got him to write thoughts  and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  There you go.  And now, oh, my God.  Now you got to just  fuck around.  Tony.  Yeah, fuck up the 
[01:06:30]  don't write out.  Yeah, there you go.  Perfect.  You never write out  the whole last name.  No, no, no.  Ever.  He'll open that.  He'll smell it.  Then he'll read it.  But now he's going to  be pissed that it wasn't  on the front page.  Oh, God.  Oh, well, we couldn't  put it on the.  It's like.  People were fucking with  him.  We can't do the right  thing.  Oh, my God.  Shit.  We got it. 
[01:07:00]  Oh.  Someone's got to back us  up.  Tony Dan's a left in the  middle.  You know, we were still  on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We didn't even get  pictures with him.  No.  I'll just get one at the  gym.  All right, y'all.  That was fun.  That was fun.  How great was Tony Dan?  I felt really bad not  talking to him.  He seemed amazing, right?  He was fun.  He's a nice man.  He's just a nice guy.  How would you know?  You left us.  I know.  I had it for a year.  You left us.  All day I thought of  what interview he liked  me in.  I wasn't even made with  my Patton Oswalt. 
[01:07:30]  You left us to try to  get the Metallica picture.  Yeah, I had to play  that one out.  A lot of people don't  know what happened.  They know what happened.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they might not  follow us on Twitter.  Maybe they didn't listen  to the after show  yesterday.  We kind of left them  hanging on the regular  show.  I didn't even address it  on Twitter.  When I walked out of  here, was there a hustle  and a bustle out in the  lobby area.  It was very crowded.  Something had just  happened.  It looked like people  were talking.  Right.  And I saw Florentine  there.  Yep.  He was talking with 
[01:08:00]  Young Sam Roberts  was out there.  Yeah, yeah.  And Club Soda Kenny  and Roland.  And everyone was on  high alert and very,  very nervous.  And from everybody  that I had spoken to  as I was leaving,  the scuttlebutt in the  lobby was all about  Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  They weren't nervous  because Metallica was  in the building.  They were very nervous  because they were all  trying to get Jimmy's  picture with Metallica.  And it had already  happened or not  happened.  Right.  But that's what  everyone was talking  about.  When I walked up,  I saw Florentine.  He was standing there  and he looked at me 
[01:08:30]  and he just shook  his head and he went  and he shook his head  no and just went  oh, like it didn't  happen.  It did not happen.  Yes.  So walk us through it  after you left  during the Tony Danza.  Well, I didn't know  how long they'd be  in Howard's studio.  So we were hanging  outside.  I just wanted to,  you know, preparedness  like a good Boy Scout.  Yes.  I wanted to be prepared.  And there was just a lot  of standing around  and speculating.  There was, you know,  there wasn't much  that could be done  until they walked  out of the I was 
[01:09:00]  actually I didn't want  to just stand there  and look at Howard's  studio.  So I was standing  back a little bit,  but I was like looking  into the fishbowl,  but the reflection.  Oh, my God.  I could see the door.  So this is what I  looked like I was  casually chatting.  That's not crazy at all.  No.  Jim, actually, we had  left during a break  to take a piss or  whatever.  And Jim was the  only one in here.  And Sam handed  Jimmy some copy.  And Jim is reading  the commercial.  As he's reading  the spot, he's  scrolling through  his phone, looking  for that, waiting  for that text to 
[01:09:30]  come through.  Have to be there.  Yes.  Yes.  So it was paramount.  I knew this one  wouldn't, I mean,  it was, I wasn't  pissed about it,  though, because people  tried to make it  happen.  It wasn't like  anybody was a dick  about it.  It was one of those  things where they all  just came in separately.  Yeah.  And they all just  left separately.  Well, sure.  But that's, I guarantee  they don't hang out  anymore.  Who was the first guy  to leave?  Kirk Hammett.  So as soon as I  was standing out  there.  When you saw Kirk,  though, leaving,  were you thinking  like, ha, I gotta  keep him? 
[01:10:00]  No, I knew, though.  Because when Kirk,  it wasn't like, when  Kirk Hammett walked  out, he's walked  out with this, he's a  big bald guy, I forget  his name, he works for  them, who I've seen a  million times with  them, he's always with  Kirk or James, he's  got a big go, he's a  big boy.  Um, and when I saw him  walking Kirk out, I knew  they were going right  down the elevator.  He was like, hey,  asshole.  Yeah, but it was like,  the guy's just leaving.  And then, um, so I  just said, fuck it.  And I just went and  got my stuff in here.  And when I came out,  James had just left,  like, you just missed  James.  I'm like, I didn't care  about seeing them 
[01:10:30]  individually.  Wow.  And, uh, but I went  to hop in the elevator  and Rob Trujillo was  got on the bassist, so  I wound up talking to  him, you know, and he  was just, he's just a  great guy, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was, I  appreciated people  trying, and what are  you going to do?  I didn't feel that bad  because there's no way  I could have, it was  like, no one was a  dick about it.  Right.  It was like, it was  like they took a bunch  of pictures and just  didn't include little  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Are you relieved today  though?  Although now that it's  over officially.  I'll tell you what  made me.  Because you've been  working on this for  about three days.  But I got the picture,  Roland sent me the  picture last night that 
[01:11:00]  we all took, and it  bummed me out that  James wasn't married  to him.  Oh, it's so obvious  it's a wasted picture.  I saw mine, I'm like,  yeah, without a head  field, this doesn't  really work.  It's a beautiful picture.  It doesn't work, though.  It's a fucking  beautiful picture.  Like, they took, the  serious, whoever did  photography, took  beautiful fucking  photos.  Oh, I saw the Sam  Roberts one.  What is it?  Lars' head.  Like, that's a  perfect photo.  I mean, without, of  course, James isn't  there, but that's how  you want a band  photo.  Lars' head is turning  into the bad guy from  Tango and Cash. 
[01:11:30]  Big jaw guy.  He really is.  And only love for  Sam Roberts in that  picture.  I heard AIDS, you're  a mutant.  Yeah, plenty of love  from the fans.  Well, that's nice.  AIDS!  And it's always, yeah,  it always hurts when  men don't find you  attractive.  Whenever men have a  problem with your  looks, your hair,  your shoes, your  clothes, anything.  Oh, it really just 
[01:12:00]  busts me up.  It's just a little  creepy.  Yeah.  We had our own  running with, not  running, but our  James Hetfield  sighting.  Oh, boy, did we.  When we went  downstairs, me and  Oak went downstairs,  and there was a fan  standing there, and he  had some pictures and  whatnot, and he goes,  oh, guys, big fan,  can I take a picture?  And he had a buddy  with him, so he  hands his buddy the  camera.  We were feeling  good.  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, look at us  getting old.  So we recognize, and  someone wants our  picture.  Yeah.  We stand there, I  mean, ready to snap, 
[01:12:30]  and he goes, there's  James!  And he goes, whoa, and  runs off.  He goes, I gotta get  James!  I gotta get James!  And he walks up to  James, he's like, James,  could you just sign this  for me?  And James is just, like,  not even acknowledging  him.  Just walking.  I don't like that at  all, man, and I'll tell  you why.  There was no one  else around.  I've seen it a bunch,  and we're lucky enough  to be in this spot where  we see celebrities leave,  and they're leaving in an  area where there's no  real fans around at all. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, outside the  building's a whole  different story.  This guy happened to be  in the lobby, and it  would have taken James  fucking five seconds  tops to take a quick  picture of this guy, and  not only did he not take  the picture, he just  kept walking, and he was  kind of just nodding at  the guy, but more like  looking for the door and  get the fuck out.  I saw Lady Gaga do that  shit, and a few others.  It's like, I saw Miley  Cyrus do that.  Did you think that guy  was, uh...  Because everyone's  ending at the same  time.  That guy seemed like an 
[01:13:30]  eBay guy.  That's what I was  going to ask you, and  they didn't seem like,  because he had pictures  in his hands, a folder.  Whatever.  A folder?  Yeah, they got a lot  of those guys.  Whatever.  If we were lucky  enough to be that  famous, I don't give a  fuck a...  Someone makes a few  bucks on eBay off our  photograph.  Who cares?  I think a lot of those  guys hate them.  I think they don't, uh...  I don't know.  Yeah, I think they just  hate them, motherfuckers.  Yeah, they hate them.  He was looking for a  picture, though.  Was he?  Yeah.  I heard it signed.  Someone told me he  tried to get James to  sign.  I heard that story 
[01:14:00]  about James.  I didn't hear about  you guys.  Yeah, no, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Me and Anna are  standing there.  We watch him run  after James a little,  and then we're just  like...  And we're like,  fuck this.  Fuck this guy.  We ain't waiting  around.  So he didn't get a  James picture or  signature, and he  didn't get our picture.  Fuck him.  We just left at  that point.  Fuck, we're not  waiting around now as  he tries to get  something off Headfield.  Waiting with our arms  still out for him to  come in there so  they're around him.  Look, a lot of  celebrities do that.  I don't like it.  I've seen it with my  own eyes, and, you 
[01:14:30]  know, I'm sure they  have their reasoning.  Their reasons,  whatever, but it's  just...  I don't know, man.  I understand, like,  if they're walking  through, like, a busy  area and they stop,  that could be a  problem, because  then everyone's  like, oh, fuck,  who's that?  Oh, fuck, I need a  picture, too.  Then it becomes a...  Everyone starts  swarming.  But when you know  it's only one or  two guys and no  one else is around,  I don't see what  the harm is, really.  I heard on the 
[01:15:00]  Sam Roberts  after show yesterday  that Jim Florentine  was on it, and Jim  said every time the  Howard area door  opened, he saw  flashes going off  from people taking  pictures with  Metallica.  But it might not  have been Metallica,  like, as a...  I mean, I'm sure  they took band  pictures, but back  after that show  ended, because I  think Scott knows  Lars pretty well,  because Lars was  the last one out,  and then after James  left, it was  Trujillo left, and  then Lars was still  in there when I  left. 
[01:15:30]  So I imagine they  were back there  all talking.  I don't imagine  they were just  standing there for  a long, taking a  bunch of as  Metallica pictures,  and if they were,  they were, but I  have no access to  that area.  I don't feel...  Which is crazy.  Nah, you know  what?  But I don't  know, Howard.  I mean, we've  chatted briefly in  the hallway.  That doesn't...  I don't expect to  be brought back to  his studio by one  of his people.  But you know  what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I wouldn't expect  that.  We're supposed to be  one big happy  family where we  try to take care of  each other from  time to time, you  know.  Oh, that's right.  It's all about him.  And we're supposed  to...  It always will be. 
[01:16:00]  Sorry.  We're supposed to  show that loyalty  for the company, and  we're told a lot of  times, you know,  it's not good for the  company if you, you  know, lambast them or  go off on this or  do that.  And it's like, okay,  but there's nothing  that is put on the  other side.  Like when they have  guests over there and  they keep them long so  we don't get them, if  we ever did that,  there'd be hell to  pay.  There's a double  standard, obviously,  with both the shows,  and I think one of  them is the fact that  we would get shit on  and not have an 
[01:16:30]  opportunity to maybe  just walk through  that sacred fucking  door into the  Wizard of Oz and  fucking take a picture  with Metallica.  It's crazy.  That fucking door  is like, you  know, pure  legacy, man.  Right?  It's pure fucking  legacy.  It's not like I  asked Gary  Delabatti and he  said no either.  I didn't, you  know, I asked  Ross Zepin as he  walked in and he  actually walked in  and asked Metallica's  people, but we just  know.  Yeah, I think he  did.  As soon as he closes  that door behind you,  then, you know, he  can make believe he  asked.  I'm just saying  that's a possibility. 
[01:17:00]  I have no idea.  Going to Gophers?  Right, right.  Got any extra tickets?  Are you crazy?  Yeah, I talked to my  manager and he's  going to take $100  off that true coat.  He did not.  He might not.  He knew who to  ask for and I  think he would  just, if you don't  want it to come  back to you, didn't  do something, why  wouldn't he?  If he didn't, he  did.  But whatever, I  think people did  make the effort and  I appreciate the  effort.  But he's in the  Wizard of Oz.  Yes, the Wizard.  Yeah.  Pay no attention to  the man behind that  door with a fist on 
[01:17:30]  it.  The Wizard himself  is starting to look  like an old aunt.  Auntie M.  Auntie M.  Auntie H.  Auntie H.  Auntie H.  I think he's  wearing girls'  clothes now.  Yes.  That scarf was a  little weird.  I think officially  he's wearing girls'  clothes.  Grandma's scarf was  a little weird.  Yeah, a little  strange.  There might be a  picture floating  around where he  looks like an  ant.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little frilly.  A bit frilly for my  taste.  E-Rock, you handed  me a note over here.  Is this your  handwriting? 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  What is this?  Well, we found  out after the  after show from  several people in  the hallway that I  guess while Jim was  waiting in the lobby  to find out what was  going on with  Metallica.  Right.  At one point,  Metallica wasn't  even in Howard's  area.  They were in the  hallway over here in  Jose's office just  hanging out.  All of them?  All of them.  And then Kurt went  back in through  Howard's compound  through the back  end, got his bag,  and that's when  he left. 
[01:18:30]  The other guys were  still over in  Jose's office.  The whole band was  in Jose's office?  That's what was  said to me after,  yeah.  Wow.  And Jose knew we  were looking, but  I don't know if he  knew I was.  I don't know, but  that's what we found  out when everything  was done and we  walked back to the  office.  You're usually  pretty good with  details, Jimmy.  You're usually  pretty good with  details.  Wow.  That's possible.  He walked by Jose's  office, the whole  band's in there.  Hey, Jose, what's  up?  Oh, hey, guys, you  mind if I get a  pick?  And then you  sit there.  Oh, fuck, I wish  I would have known  that. 
[01:19:00]  No, I didn't  know.  Hey, we knew we  would have said  something, but maybe  we shouldn't have  told Jimmy that.  Yeah, you missed  Tony Danza.  Yeah, he was  really cool.  Yeah, his whole  musical thing.  How did he react  when half the room  left?  It was so funny.  Right in the middle  of the conversation,  Jimmy gets up to  leave and he just  goes, oh, Metallica.  Metallica.  You even got Tony  Danza involved.  He knew Tony Danza  was nervous. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, he was  cool.  I'm looking at my  almost Metallica  picture right now.  Yeah.  It just doesn't  work.  Yeah, I saw it.  I mean, they're all  superstars in their  own right, but when  you're in a group  thing, why did you  download this instead  of the actual  picture?  Oh, boy, fuck.  What happened  there?  I don't know.  Where's the picture?  It's fun, though.  You get to pretend  you're the fourth  guy.  That is true.  It's almost like  taking a picture with  the cardboard cutouts  and you're the 
[01:20:00]  singer.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what the  just Photoshop  James in there  somewhere.  He doesn't manage  throwing it back.  Google.  Fucking just  crop it out.  Beautiful.  Yeah, be  beautiful.  He's tall.  You could just  put him behind  everybody.  Yes.  That would be so  cheesy if somebody  actually did that.  Fuck it.  And then  downstairs, I guess  they were me.  That's irritating.  If the band was  in Jose's office,  no one says  anything. 
[01:20:30]  They should say  something.  Of course, we all  knew that you  needed the picture.  Everyone was on  high alert.  Is that true?  Yeah, I heard  that.  What were they  doing in there?  Saying hi, I  guess.  I don't know.  They told me  after I got off  the air, like  at 1130 in the  morning, they  said, yeah,  they came to  say hi to Jose  and they were  all hanging out  in his office.  Who knows if  it was the  whole band or  if it was  fucking...  They said  it was a  band.  I mean, I  don't know.  Like, obviously,  I didn't see  if it was a  beautiful hobby,  but...  Was it the  whole band?  Because they  said, you 
[01:21:00]  know, Howard's  got that  back door.  Yeah, yeah,  yeah.  So they  went through  his back  door, hung  out in  Jose's office  for a second.  And then  went back  through the  back door  and around.  Don't you  have another  opportunity?  No.  Oh, I  thought you  did.  Nope, that's  it.  That's it.  That is it.  You sure?  Yeah.

That it is, and my name is  Iraq, and it is the worst of  2013 for the Opie and Anthony  Show.  In 2013, renewed our interest in  the radio phenomenon known as  Mike Francesa.  If you're not familiar with who  Mike is, he's a local sports  talk show host heard here on  WFAN in New York City.  He's also simulcast, well, at  the time. 
[01:30:30]  He was also simulcast on the  Yes Network, and his listeners  loved pranking him.  He would fall asleep.  He would spill things.  All sorts of shit was going on  at that show, but Mike has had  enough, and he called into the  Opie and Anthony show to  explain his position on certain  issues, and also followed up by  discussing, of all things, the  Pope.  Here it is.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Let's say hi to Mike Francesa,  who knows a little bit about the  A-Rod situation.  Mike?  Boys, you're looking for a little  insight.  You called me at home. 
[01:31:00]  Not a problem.  I'm always glad to come on.  It's been a while.  It's been a while, Mikey.  How are you?  I think what bothers me is both  about A-Rod.  I'm sitting there like the rest of  the nation, and we're watching  this press conference, and we  don't know exactly what goes on.  I wasn't there.  You weren't there.  We only have the only evidence  was given to us.  But when Alex is up there in  front of the world, God and  contrary, and he says, I feel  fortunate to put this uniform on  again.  I feel like I'm 18 years old  when I first faced the website. 
[01:31:30]  Alex, you're out there because  you're coming off an injury,  and this is your grandstand.  I mean, you have to...  It's okay.  You had a big major champion,  okay?  And you took the words out of  my mouth.  And Alex could say yesterday,  I think Twork 1 should be here  today, okay?  That's my opinion, okay?  But I'm not actually on Twork 1,  okay?  Twork 1, but I don't have any  problem with these gay remarks,  okay?  And the fact that he works  for your station, he's  defended it.  And the fact that he works  for your station, okay?  Now, I'm actually going to  have problems at home, okay?  Because outrage might come out,  and then I change my tone of  voice, okay? 
[01:32:00]  And my wife just told me,  I don't know what this big deal  of a lot is.  And I say, I'm not just  going to do it with my  small children.  I said, the guy did steroids!  What's the matter with you?  You don't know what he did wrong!  Oh, he's the angry Mike now.  That's right, he is.  The guy did steroids!  That's some wonderful  insight, Mike.  All right, guys, that's all I  have.  I don't want to burn out here,  okay?  So I'll talk to you guys soon.  All right, there you go.  Mike Francesa, everyone.  Let's say hi to Mike Francesa. 
[01:32:30]  He knows a bit about baseball  and sports in general.  Mike?  Hey, Mike.  With the New York Yankees  officially out of the race,  okay, for the second time  in a long time, okay?  And the average Yankee fan  who's in their 20s, okay,  is spoiled, okay?  And they don't know how  to deal with adversity, okay?  But on the night,  a magical night,  the number 42 takes his final  at you in front of the  box crowd, okay?  Yes.  It is an emotional thing 
[01:33:00]  and it's something that  we're never going to see  again, okay?  But, Mike, you're not  an emotional guy,  so what were you thinking  when that all went down  last night?  Well, I've been told  that I have ice in my veins,  okay?  Italian ice in my veins,  okay?  Italian ice.  Italian ice.  Italian ice.  Italian ice.  Italian ice.  Delicious, okay?  Easy.  You ever have a hot day  in the backyard  and you have Italian ice?  That's great, okay?  But sitting on my couch  finishing off my fourth  bag of Fritos yesterday,  I had a tear in my eye. 
[01:33:30]  Okay?  And it trickled down  my rosy red cheek.  And you didn't know  what that was at first,  I bet.  A tear.  You must have been...  I thought I was having  a stroke of that.  Right.  But, uh...  I ate four bags of Fritos.  I caught that, too.  We're going to see...  We're going to see  a very different Yankee team,  okay?  Coming up in these  next few years.  And it's something  that Yankee fans know,  okay?  The question is,  if you listened to my show  yesterday,  Ad Nauseam,  I repeated the number...  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:34:00]  Wait, wait.  Back up.  We didn't hear you.  Ad Nauseam got me.  The Ad Nauseam got Jimmy.  What did you say?  If you listened to my show  Ad Nauseam yesterday,  what?  You repeated.  You would have heard me  repeat the number,  189, okay?  189.  Okay?  And that is going to be  the Yankee budget, okay?  Are they going to be  under 189 million?  Over 189 million, okay?  If it's under 189,  then you're going to  finish in third place, okay? 
[01:34:30]  Because you're not going to  get great.  You're still in pitching.  Now, if you're going to go  over 189, okay?  Because they say 189  and 189 over and over again.  You keep saying noin.  Well, that's how you say noin.  Is that it?  Yes.  Oh.  We may see the end.  We have seen the end  of Andy Pettit.  We have seen the end  of Jorge Posada, okay?  Three quarters of the Fab Four,  okay?  Go on.  Yeah.  Number two is next, okay?  And that's what we have  to prepare for, folks, okay?  Never mind the problems  overseas and the world  crisis and the budget.  It's that when number two 
[01:35:00]  leaves, it is going to be  catastrophic to the Yankee fan,  okay?  And that's what we've got  to prepare for, okay?  Nothing lasts forever.  189, right?  189.  Are you going to stay over?  Yeah.  Or are you going to go on to 189?  If you pull the tape from yesterday,  189.  Every caller they called,  Mike, who do you think  they're going to get next year?  Are you going to be on to  over 189?  Now, before I go, okay, I just  want to say to Mr. Mariano Rivera,  okay? 
[01:35:30]  He's happening again, you know.  I just want you to know that it  was a pleasure to watch you and I  think that you were the greatest  world, quite much.  I think that you were the greatest  world, okay?  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  We've got to know whether they're  going to stay over on the 189.  All right, Mikey.  I'm okay.  You guys live.  All right, Mike Francesa. 
[01:36:00]  You're getting a little emotional  this morning.  Yes, yes.  This is a big deal.  Okay, okay, okay.  I can't believe how many Fritos he  ate while he was watching the game.  He made himself sound like a real pig.  So, Mike Francesa was on the air.  We can't get enough of this guy.  Everyone else is starting to enjoy  Mike Francesa.  Did he doze off during the smoke?  We've known about him for years,  obviously, and I don't know, man.  His clips go viral very easily.  Oh, people love him.  He just kind of, he kind of just 
[01:36:30]  wings it every day, and he kind of  got caught with this one.  He did?  I think so.  People are enjoying this clip.  I love it.  Mike interrupts a caller to wrongly  name the new Pope.  Not an easy name to say, in all  fairness.  Well, that's why you say now  Pope Francis.  It's easy.  Hey, just go Pope Francis.  He's always eaten.  He's always eaten it.  Whenever they do what they do,  after the game, they bring him  in the postcard.  The Pope is, is that the Pope? 
[01:37:00]  Scala is the Pope, huh?  So, the Italian is the Pope.  So, the favorite is the Pope.  It was the lead Italian who is  the next Pope.  Is that it?  Was that the, was that the,  they just flashed Scala up there.  Is that him?  No, it's not Scala.  Oh.  Scala.  Oh, Mike.  Learned a little bit about that,  too.  He was the odds-on favorite  going into the whole thing.  Was he?  Yeah, the Scala guy.  But it wasn't Scala.  No.  No. 
[01:37:30]  Pope.  Is that it?  Was that the, was that the,  they just flashed Scala up there.  Is that him?  Well, they just put,  they just put Scala up there.  Did they, was he,  they announced he's the Pope?  Right.  They just put his picture up.  Scala, he's the,  he is the,  he was considered the favorite.  He was the lead Italian.  Was that just a picture of him  that went up by accident?  Or was that,  I don't have the sound on.  Was that a picture?  Was that him?  But they just put a picture of him up  on MSNBC. 
[01:38:00]  They just put a picture of Scala up.  He's infuriating.  Were they announcing that he's the Pope?  Or not?  Is he so pompous?  Or they just announced that he's the favorite.  Okay.  So you guys are watching CBS.  We'll see what happens there.  All right.  All right.  Because they,  they put up,  who'd they put up?  They showed Scala,  a slide of Scala now.  He's been the favorite all along.  Has he?  But I don't know if they,  they showed a slide.  Maybe that was by accident.  Or maybe they're discussing that he's the favorite. 
[01:38:30]  Holy shit.  He fucking stinks.  Scala's raining up yet,  so maybe he's not.  They pay him so much fucking money.  You hear him just rambling on?  What a boy.  Scala,  was that Scala?  They put his picture up.  He's the favorite Italian.  He's the one.  Is he the Pope?  Scala?  Did Scala?  They picked Scala.  They put his picture up.  Was that a mistake?  Because he's the Italian.  He was the Italian,  and Carter,  the favorite.  Scala?  Did they put Scala?  Oh my God. 
[01:39:00]  Enough about Scala.  Right.  That's what happens when you have a team,  and all of a sudden it's one guy.  He's been used to talking to somebody else  for so many years,  so he's just doing both parts now.  Oh, he's fucking...  So then,  Mike delivers a riveting  edge of your seat people announcement here.  Ooh.  All right?  I can't wait.  Here's the official announcement  from our pal Mike Francesa.  This is...  Who is this man?  This is the Senior Cardinal?  Okay.  So he'll announce the name of the new Pope. 
[01:39:30]  Tell me what it is.  News of great joy.  We have a Pope.  The Pope's name is Cardinal.  Do we get it first as Cardinal,  or do we get his name as a Pope now?  Oh, what?  Whoa.  Boy, look how many people are there.  My God. 
[01:40:00]  The play-by-play is fantastic.  Did you say who it was, guys?  I don't see anything printed on the screen.  I don't have the sound on, folks.  I can't tell you what it says.  Oh, these guys couldn't understand  what he was saying inside.  Sam, as an up-and-coming broadcaster,  how mad are you?  Because I remember these days where I go,  I just know in my fucking soul  I'm better than some of these guys  that are, you know, way bigger.  It's one thing to have moments of silence  and be natural. 
[01:40:30]  He does this every day.  But it's like chunks of time  where there is no sound.  And it's just...  How could anybody be listening to it?  Because he don't give a fuck.  He knows he's untouchable.  He knows CBS loves them  because they're all about sports talk right now.  So he's like, fuck, I got this gig.  You have ten seconds of dead air  broken up with a deep breath  five seconds in.  And that's it.  And then erroneous information.  Oh, it gets better.  I assume...  Wait a minute.  Skola is now the shortstop for the Cardinals?  Wait, what?  He's just lousy. 
[01:41:00]  He's lousy and he's on because...  He's lazy.  You can leave it on.  He's lazy.  You can just leave it on.  Because that's the hot format right now.  So, you know...  He knows sports, but he's just a bore.  And he's been around for so long  people just tune in as a habit.  But who enjoys that guy?  Who enjoys his opinions or his voice?  I don't know.  Okay.  Okay.  I love when they prank him.  I know you're out there, man.  Keep it going.  I haven't heard one in a while.  What's wrong with you guys?  He knows that just his voice,  people would just listen  because they're used to hearing his voice. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  So he literally does no work.  Right.  At all.  Right.  I was at a post office one time  listening to him  while I was doing something.  I'm like, that's why he makes the money.  Because you can leave him on everywhere.  Guys can listen to him  because he's talking about something  that they want to hear  and he's never going to get you in any trouble.  Yeah, but you could get another guy to do that.  That's a little more engaging.  I totally agree.  With a little more energy.  You can get anybody to do that.  A little more passion.  The guy has absolutely no passion  for what he does.  Like, that could easily...  What?  Mm, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Scala?  You can get a guy  that doesn't get anybody in trouble,  but a guy who, like,  will make you stop and go,  oh, what did he just say?  Oh, wow.  He's really into it.  That's interesting.  Let me listen to this.  Yeah, exactly.  That's interesting.  A little energy, something.  Oh, you've got to hear this.  Does anybody go,  oh, you've got to hear what Mike said today?  Nope.  Nope.  So here's the rest of his announcement.  I don't have the sound on, folks.  I can't tell you what it says.  Oh, these guys couldn't understand  what he was saying inside,  so they didn't put up a graphic yet,  so we don't have a graphic. 
[01:42:30]  The cardinal from...  This is it?  The archbishop...  Well, he's an archbishop, though.  Wow, my God.  Oh, this is it.  Cardinal...  This is the Pope?  Wow.  Who's the Pope?  But his heirs from Argentina,  he's it?  He's it.  Is that it?  You're it.  So Cardinal Jorge Mario...  Rivera.  Bergoglio?  Bergoglio?  That's...  He's the new Pope?  The cardinal from Argentina. 
[01:43:00]  Okay, so the cardinal...  Cardinal.  76-year-old Pope.  So they went...  They went for an older Pope.  Okay, so Cardinal...  Cardinal...  Cardinal...  You guys will tell me  when they say it,  how do you say his name?  And then we'll find out  what his papal name is.  But basically,  the cardinal from Argentina...  There might be two.  I don't even know  if there are two from Argentina.  Holy shit.  But the cardinal from Argentina, 
[01:43:30]  the 76-year-old cardinal  from Argentina...  The guy that announced  the Hindenburg crash  had it more together  than fucking Mikey.  He's like a smoke of boring.  It's like a smoldering odor.  Just hanging out in the room.  It just envelops you.  Crushes you.  Oh, God.  He's so full of himself.  He's ridiculously full of himself.  He won't let his producers  talk on the air  because you can tell  they're talking in his headphones.  Right.  And it's just...  He would rather have silence  than anybody else's voice 
[01:44:00]  on his show.  And I think that...  Well, who am I to say  because he's still doing it,  but that seems to be a mistake.  If you've got guys  that might give you  a little more energy  and you could actually  have a conversation with,  I think that would sound better.  Like, imagine if that was  a two-way conversation  we just heard  instead of Mike seemingly  talking to himself  going,  Oh, no.  I can't hear the TV.  Oh, God.  There's no graphic.  Yeah.  Yep.  Uh...  Who was that?  I thought he was an archbishop.  He's a cardinal?  Cardinal?  Is he a cardinal?  Cardinal?  Or an archbishop? 
[01:44:30]  I think there's two.  I think there's two.  Are there two popes now?  We're running with a two pope.  We got the pope  and the reliever.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is O&A's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Okay, everyone's opened  their presents.  Quick, Carly,  take down the tree.

[01:49:00]  O&A Show on Twitter,  on Instagram,  and Facebook.  That'll keep you connected  with the Opie and Anthony Show  until we return  on January 6, 2014.  2013 had many big,  high-profile cases in the news.  One in particular  was the George Zimmerman,  Trayvon Martin case.  The Opie and Anthony Show  was lucky enough  to have some ties to this case  as we had George's brother,  Robert Zimmerman,  on the show a few times  throughout the case  and leading up to the verdict.  This is audio  with Robert back on the show  post the verdict,  and we hear about  everything that's going on. 
[01:49:30]  It's a big deal.  Robert Zimmerman,  right now.  O&A's worst of 2013.  All right, Chris.  Are you coming over  with Robert?  He just walked in.  Hey, there he is.  Robert Zimmerman  just walked into the studio.  We were going to take a break  and do the show.  Do we have nobody  working for the show?  How did you walk in?  I know.  He snuck up on us.  Do you have a gun?  At home?  All right.  Just want to make sure  if we have a confrontation here  you don't shoot anybody. 
[01:50:00]  Jesus.  You're profiling him.  Yes.  I know.  I'm trying to bring  some humor  into this crazy world.  Robert.  What's up, Robert?  How you doing?  You must be exhausted.  Very exhausted,  but thanks for having me back.  You're all over the place  over the weekend.  And it was kind of weird  because no one  had heard from you  for a while.  Right.  During the trial,  you went to Twitter dark  and TV shows  and everything,  and then all of a sudden  it was good to see you  back on TV again. 
[01:50:30]  Thank you.  I know you must have  had some concern  and worries  about what the verdict  would have been,  might have been.  Right up until  the moment they announced it,  what were your feelings?  I came to New York  preemptively expecting  the right verdict.  I think we got  the right verdict.  Yeah.  Obviously,  it's cautious optimism,  but they made the right call  and that's what we were expecting.  Were you confident throughout? 
[01:51:00]  Did you keep an eye on the trial?  I mean,  he must have the entire time.  We could not watch  the trial itself  nor be in the courtroom.  Wow.  The only person  who could be in the courtroom  was our little sister,  and that's because  of something called  the rule of sequestration,  where if you're a witness  for either party,  you're excluded  from the courtroom.  Right, right.  So,  that must have been  very frustrating  because you didn't know  how well or bad  of a job  the defense was doing  for your brother  or how well  or poorly 
[01:51:30]  the prosecution was doing.  Yeah,  I mean,  you see,  you know,  things come up on Twitter.  You get emails  about stuff  or, you know,  Google alerts,  but you don't actually  sit there and watch,  you know,  the testimony.  Wait,  you weren't watching  on CNN  like everyone else  the last few days?  He's not allowed to.  You're not even allowed to?  I mean,  not during testimony,  which is everything,  but, you know,  jury selection's fine,  opening statements,  closing statements,  those are non-evidentiary things,  but once testimony begins,  no.  But are they making sure  you're not watching  or are you taking  a little peek  here and there?  They're not, 
[01:52:00]  well,  I mean,  things,  you know,  come up,  yeah,  but you're not technically  supposed to sit there  and just watch it.  Right,  right,  yeah.  Wow.  I did not know that.  That's correct,  because watching the trial,  I was,  you know,  fully involved,  watching pretty much  every minute of it.  I noticed as time went by  that this was really,  obviously,  a self-defense case.  The prosecution was really  running around in circles.  The defense constantly had 
[01:52:30]  something to present.  Like O'Mara said,  it was the Bizarro case.  I mean,  the prosecution was acting  like the defense  and vice versa.  So me watching it,  I was very confident  that as long as  you didn't have  some kind of weird thing  and that X factor  with the jury,  you could always  have that problem.  Sure.  But unless that happened,  I absolutely saw  an acquittal coming.  Yeah.  So it must have been  rough for you  not having seen it.  It is kind of bizarre 
[01:53:00]  not following it that way,  but I don't think  we needed a trial  to tell us  what really happened  in the situation.  We knew it happened.  It happened.  Since February of last year.  Yeah.  So now after the verdict  comes through,  did you watch it on TV?  I tried to watch it on TV.  We got an announcement  there would be a verdict.  I was in my hotel lobby  and my phone got so many tweets  and emails and texts  that it just kind of like  started floating up in the air  because it was just blowing up  and I got to a TV 
[01:53:30]  as fast as I could  and I missed the live reading,  but I did see it at CNN later.  How nervous were you  when they said  the verdict is coming?  Regardless of what you feel,  it's still got to be  a terrible,  nerve-wracking moment.  Yes, it is.  We had heard  that there were  there was a question,  a jury question.  They wanted clarification  on the manslaughter  and instruction.  So that was encouraging  because it kind of told me  that if the jurors  were going through  the instructions 
[01:54:00]  chronologically  that they had  gone past murder too  or they would have  just convicted  of murder too  right then and there.  And a lot of people  were also saying,  yeah,  Anthony,  what do you think of this?  They have a question  about manslaughter.  Does that mean  they're looking  to give them manslaughter?  I was like,  they have to understand  the charge  before they could  then understand  what the justification  to negate that charge is.  Yes.  His self-defense  justification.  So I didn't feel  that was a hurdle  or anything  and like you said, 
[01:54:30]  I thought it was  a good thing  because it pretty much  threw away the murder too  which I think they looked at  and didn't even have to  then look at the self-defense.  I think they knew  murder too just didn't apply  regardless of self-defense  in that situation.  I tend to agree  or they probably,  or you never know  but they might have asked  for some kind of clarification  as to murder too  but the way,  I mean manslaughter,  the way when you just say it  it means a man was slaughtered.  You know,  someone killed someone  and it's defined so differently  in every jurisdiction  that, you know, 
[01:55:00]  non-attorneys coming  and seeing something like that,  the way that it is excused  under the manslaughter instruction  is either justifiable  or excusable.  Right.  And justifiable is  in your dwelling  or to prevent  a forcible felony  like you're getting robbed  and you shoot someone  for example  and then excusable  has its other stipulations  but then when you get  to the self-defense instruction  which is the justifiable  use of force  that kind of is  a defense for both of them.  Right, yeah. 
[01:55:30]  So I think that's what happened.  What do you think it is  that your brother represents  because, you know,  I had my issues  with the verdict  although I did not want  to see him go to jail  for murder too  but what do you think  it is that he represents  that's got people so upset  because I don't think  it's just George Zimmerman  or Trayvon Martin.  He's become like,  like these things happen  that make the whole country  kind of focus  and it means something more.  I think the reprehensible media  probably has a lot to do  with perception.  I do.  I think that when this  happened in the beginning  there was just George 
[01:56:00]  and Trayvon Martin,  you know,  for about a day  and I think that after,  you know,  in my view,  Ms. Fulton  and Mr. Martin  had grief  like any parent would.  I think their grief  was exploited.  That's really what I feel  in my heart  by Mr. Benjamin Crump  and Ms. Natalie Jackson  and they started  a race narrative,  a smear campaign  that the media  was all too happy to.  Oh, they love that.  They love it.  Yeah.  And so that's what  that, you know,  repeating white man, 
[01:56:30]  black child,  gated community,  you know,  over and over and over again  has its effect  and that's what it,  that's where the snowball effect  I guess started  and combined with the vacuum  of not knowing anything  about George  and then we start to find  things out about George  and then like he's not white,  you know,  and then the term  white Hispanic gets coined  and then we start,  you know,  finding out more about George  and then NBC edits  their tapes to say  there's someone suspicious here,  he's black,  he's wearing a hoodie  in essence, you know. 
[01:57:00]  And it also didn't help  that President Obama  got involved as well.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I don't,  I don't think it,  I don't think it did.  I don't think anyone  really would have known  how to make sense of that  at the time.  I think,  you know,  my opinion is  it was kind of a missed opportunity  to be presidential  and to just take race  off the table.  You know,  I don't,  I think a white president  saying,  you know,  if I had a son  he would have looked like  whomever  would have been laughed  out of office.  Yeah,  yeah,  exactly.  Yeah,  putting the race angle  in there was a little silly. 
[01:57:30]  I thought,  I don't know,  that didn't,  and again,  I know Obama probably meant,  that's one of those  with kind of like,  you have a certain  deniability there.  I think he could have  also meant it  in a very parental way,  but,  you know,  it could have been racial  or it could have been.  He would have looked like,  not acted,  not been,  not,  you know,  he's basing it on  color of skin.  No,  he would look like  Trayvon Martin,  like I could see myself  in a parent's shoes,  like that could be my son.  I didn't take it  like he meant literally,  like,  you know,  he would have the same  skin tone,  you know.  But,  and Jimmy, 
[01:58:00]  you gotta consider  what were the  Zimmerman parents  coming through.  I think that's,  yeah,  that's something  that only we felt  that,  I guess,  attack at the time.  My dad referred to it  as hate.  You know,  I don't have a son,  but if I did have a son,  I would hope that we  would investigate  whatever caused his death.  And I don't think  I have to put my ethnicity  or my race  into that statement.  Yeah,  exactly.  Well,  the press was reprehensible.  Like,  they were disgusting  with how they,  you know,  there was nothing fair 
[01:58:30]  about the way  they had,  even on the cover  of the Daily News today.  Oh,  it's terrible.  It's a picture  of an empty hoodie  and it lists,  you know,  Emma Till,  when will it end?  Like,  they're just completely  biased  and they don't admit  that they are.  They act like  they're just delivering  news in an unbiased fashion.  Yeah,  and I think that  there's this,  you know,  I don't know,  effort to kind of label  what happened here  in this particular case  with,  or paint it  with a broad brush  of gun violence. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah,  yeah.  And that was right  out of the,  current playbook  of senseless gun violence.  You know,  an act of self-defense  has now rolled  into this broad category  that has,  it has nothing to do  with gun violence.  Well,  because if you call it  gun violence,  you don't have to address  the real issue,  which was,  first of all,  there's a huge issue  with black-on-black crime  in major cities  that doesn't get  any attention.  Right.  And also,  responsibility,  personal responsibility.  a lot of emotion 
[01:59:30]  came into this case,  obviously,  but if you look at  what happened,  you'll watch the news now,  you'll never know  Trayvon even touched George.  You will not hear  word one,  you will hear  unarmed team  walking home  with his kittles  gets gunned down  by a neighborhood  watch guy.  Now,  he was shot  because he was  walking black.  Right.  He was a black man,  boy walking home.  Nothing anymore 
[02:00:00]  since the trial's over  about him  beating your brother's head.  Yeah,  there's all these  different directions  that kind of  the bar keeps getting lowered.  It's that,  or it's,  you know,  you know,  but if you're,  if you're,  if you're having a fist fight,  you shouldn't just pull out  your gun and shoot someone.  You know,  and people say yes  and thanks for coming  on my program,  you know,  and they leave it at that.  You know,  it's,  it's nauseating.  That's not what happened  if someone tries  to take your gun.  I've never had my nose broken,  but I imagine  from what I hear, 
[02:00:30]  it's quite a,  a blindsiding  and disorienting injury  as it is  in pitch black,  having your head pounded  in the concrete  after that  and then someone telling you  I'm going to kill you  and then trying to take your gun.  Yeah.  I don't think you have  much of a choice.  Now,  people who don't like guns,  would rather that gun  not have been there  no matter what would have happened.  No matter what.  Right.  Right.  So they,  they,  they are the ones  who resort to lowering the bar  by saying,  you know,  well,  it was just a fist fight  and you know,  this guy had Skittles  but this guy brought a gun.  Well,  people in our society  are armed 
[02:01:00]  and if you go  and break people's noses  and sit on them  and pummel them  and rain down blows  and you don't know  that they're armed,  you might unfortunately  find yourself  at,  at,  at,  at,  on the business end of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  And that's,  and again,  I believe his self-defense.  Like I do believe  he was being beaten up  and I believe  Trayvon Wart  was kicking the shit  out of him.  I don't fault him  for pulling that.  It's really weird feelings  I have about it  because I don't think  that he's this terrible.  I,  I,  I have a hard time  believing that he didn't  know the name of that street  when he got out of the car.  That,  that's a really tough one 
[02:01:30]  for me to swallow  that he did not know  the name of the street.  Yeah,  I,  I think he's.  What would be the motive?  What would be the motive  of him not,  not telling the police  what the name of the street is though?  Honestly,  I think he did say  the name of that street  but I don't think  he said the name of where  he had last,  lost sight of Trayvon was,  it wasn't a street.  It was like a cross  between homes  and I,  I think if you hear  the recording,  there is,  he does say  retreat view circle  or whatever  but he doesn't know  what the,  when you cross behind homes  and you just come out 
[02:02:00]  on this other road  that there's no way  you would have driven it.  You don't drive that,  you have to like  walk it to get there  and yeah,  there are only three streets  but I guess in that,  at that time,  at that moment,  he didn't know it exactly  and he's,  he was trying to get  the best information.  Yeah,  that one,  that one has been  very difficult for me  and again,  I don't think that means  that he set out  because I'm going to  hunt this guy down.  You know,  the Judge Alex,  again,  I have to credit him  and raise good points  about,  well,  sometimes you,  you say things  to make yourself  look a little bit better  even though what you're 
[02:02:30]  saying is basically,  remember he said that?  Like what you're saying  is basically true.  I mean,  I just,  I simply don't,  I think that he wanted,  again,  this is my opinion,  I think that he wanted  to further the contact  but not to a point of violence  and not to a point of,  I think that he wanted  to be there  when the cops got there  and had the cops go,  great job,  you got him.  I think that he wanted  this to go a little further.  I,  I would think  that he was just  watching him.  There was no indication  before  or during  what happened  that would lead me 
[02:03:00]  to believe  he wanted  to confront him.  He was on the phone  with the police.  He had called them.  He knew the police  were literally minutes away.  He wanted to watch him  so he could go,  there,  officer,  there he is.  He walked around that way,  he went this way,  I kept my eye on him  and now,  finally,  you guys are here  and we know  where this guy is.  And he went in that house  or he got in a car  and left  or whatever.  Something,  but it seems to me  that the narrative here  that people want you  to believe  is the second 
[02:03:30]  he got out of that car  he became this hunter.  There's no gray area,  there's no,  he got out of the car  to look around the corner  and see where he went.  He got out of the car  to keep an eye on him.  He got out of the car  to follow him  from 20 yards behind  never getting any closer.  It's,  once he got out of the car  he was pouncing on him.  That's not what I'm saying though.  But that's what a lot of people  are saying.  That's the power of words  and I think right out of  Crump's script,  the word pursuit  has a very specific implication.  As opposed to following, 
[02:04:00]  you can follow something  perpetually,  but pursuing means  you intend to.  There's a good one,  stalking was another one  that was used  and following even  sounded ominous  when they put it  in the context  of what happened.  Well, yeah,  it became synonymous  with pursuing  or hunting down  or whatever.  After you repeat  that enough.  Chased was another one.  He chased down  this boy  and it's like,  God, stop  with trying to make  this something  it's not.  What's George been doing  since the verdict? 
[02:04:30]  My understanding  is he's resting  a lot.  Just resting?  A lot, yeah.  A lot.  Just kind of decompressing  and, you know.  Is he in hiding kind of?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, we all are  in Florida.  Right, yeah.  We're all at different places.  Have you debated  leaving Florida?  Like, maybe not at this moment  but at some point  like, this is probably  not the place to be?  Yeah.  The debate was very short.  It's not the place to be.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Jeez.  It is amazing.  That's got to be scary  as hell  walking through life now. 
[02:05:00]  It is.  I feel like it  I feel a little bit  more concerned  for George  because he hasn't  been doing that.  You know, he's been  he's George  and now when the trial  came up again  and people are seeing him  day in and day out  he had a very strict  curfew  before  in his house  by 6 p.m.  for most of his trial  it later got extended  to 10 p.m.  because of kind of  the later, you know  court sessions  we're having  and having an ankle monitor 
[02:05:30]  and this awkward device  you carry around with you  the size of a Starbucks cup  you know, that  communicates with that  ankle monitor  that kind of says  if you thought I was  George Zimmerman  now I really am  George Zimmerman  so it's kind of  you have to wear  the right shoes  you're always paranoid  of getting it wet  or straying too far  from that  I think they call it  a PTU  a personal tracking unit  or whatever  you go more than  100 feet from it  and you're back in jail  and you have that paranoia  for a long time  and it's an adjustment  what was going on  outside the house  every night  there had to be people  around all the time  right? 
[02:06:00]  no  we  that's got to be  really creepy  we just vanished  off the face of the earth  and just nobody knows  where we are  at all  no one figured it out  no one figured it out  they tried  yeah  sure  that's why I'm asking  I would  in this day and age  I would  assume they would  find out where you guys  were  Spike Lee's probably looking  so he could tweet it out  well that's amazingly  ignorant to tweet out  especially of the  Sam  or even the guy  before he's been through court  you can't  fucking twitter  somebody's address  yeah and he got  the wrong people  I know 
[02:06:30]  poor old couple  it's like  what  what happened  you guys picked  terrible  you guys picked  a house  or an apartment complex  where you got  neighbors that are  just clueless  huh  that not one person  saw like  we do things  George getting fresh air  or opening a window  or something  well we do things  very discreetly  very very discreetly  I understand all that  but in this day and age  that is really hard to do  no matter who you are  well they found us last time  you know  several times  so we  wisened up  and learned from it  what kind of life 
[02:07:00]  do you think George  is going to have now  I mean  a lot of people say  his life is ruined  yeah  I would agree  you know  it won't be the same  and it will have  this other dimension  of looking over your shoulder  all the time  I don't know  that if you asked George  that he would even be able  to answer that question  right  I mean this is like  the second day of freedom  yeah  it's almost like a new  you know reality  and there's a theory  he gained all that weight  so now he could lose the weight  and he could kind of  sneak back into society  that was going around  Twitter for a while 
[02:07:30]  yeah  I've heard all kinds of theories  about the weight  to make him look like  you know  out of shape  unable to defend himself  or whatever  he just gained weight  because  he  because of the stress  the stress of that  I believe that  I believe that  you've got to be  you know  the depression  that you'd feel also  being in that situation  you're going to help him out  put him on the workout  regimen you're on  or something  I'm going to try  I'm going to try  to motivate him  as best I can  what does he do  from here though  like okay  he's acquitted  but like for the  like I'm thinking  like if he gets married  in 15 years 
[02:08:00]  he'll be like  you know Trayvon Martin  killer  he's always going to  have that side  it's not like  he can go fill out  a job application  and have you ever been  charged with any felonies  yes  married to a second degree  you know  but um  he's suing NBC  we'll see  I agree with that  I think he should  sue his appointment  it was terrible  absolutely  that was a terrible edit  and what about CNN  I guess broadcast  his social security number  and uh  they did  I don't  I don't  you know  I don't know who's  I think  obviously that's CNN's fault 
[02:08:30]  for their standards of care  but somebody put it up  on that screen  so there might be  more than one party  responsible  they put it on the screen  oh yeah  they put it on the screen  in court  which was bad enough  for the public  in a non-broadcast trial  you don't have to see  people's social  and everything  but yeah  and they made a big deal  of people were gloating  about stealing his identity  and everything else  it's like first of all  why would you now want  I don't think his credit rating  is going to be very good  for a while  as far as  give it a whirl  can you get a new number 
[02:09:00]  can you get a new social security number  I think you can  people are outraged  that he gets his gun back  that's a big story  today in the paper  yeah  I mean I understand that  I think people put  a lot of symbolism  in that gun  he in fact  committed no crime  we have  the presumption  of innocence  that we carry  when we're accused  and that presumption  of innocence  doesn't leave us  you know  we are presumed innocent  when we're found not guilty  that same presumption applies 
[02:09:30]  so if he in fact  committed no crime  there's no reason  he leaves that court  the same way  he was before  the crime was ever committed  so why  do you think though  and again I know  this is kind of a  fucking you know  a pukey left wing  college professor question  but do you think that  while we do have  the presumption of innocence  do you think that  that was kind of  and again  a courtesy  he didn't afford  Trayvon Martin  walking through that  complex  was the presumption  of innocence  I think  it's clear 
[02:10:00]  to me  when I hear  what happened  and when I talked  to George  when this happened  that  something aroused  his suspicion  and again  this notion  that  Trayvon was walking  I just don't  I don't agree  with that  I think my brother  would have to be  you know  crazy  to pick up the phone  and call the police  because someone  was walking  it sounds to me  more like someone  was loitering  you know  loitering aimlessly  not in it's  pouring rain  it's not  something that  happens in that  subdivision 
[02:10:30]  people know  where they live  and they walk  in their house  you know  or did he say  what he was doing  yeah he said  it in the call  he said  there's this guy  out here  just standing  out here  between the  houses  looking at  the homes  and it's  it's rain  it's raining  he looks  suspicious  and he said  in subsequent  reports  you know  that that's  what aroused  his suspicion  was just  his kind  of like  nonchalant  attitude  about being  where he was  he wasn't  in front  of a house  he wasn't  like in a  driveway  he wasn't  like locked  out of  a home  or trying  to get  in it  he was 
[02:11:00]  actually  between  homes  and one  of those  homes  had actually  been broken  into  I don't know  if you've  heard of  Frank Taffey  but that  was the  house  that got  broken  yeah  crazy  Frank  but that  was one  of the  homes  and you  know  unfortunately  in that  community  when people  do that  as we  heard from  the witness  on the  stand  when someone  came to  her door  and started  beating  on the  door  and you  might get  people running  around the  back  and coming  in  or someone  just kind  of standing  around as a  lookout or  whatever  so I don't 
[02:11:30]  think I think  people think  of what  happened  and don't  put it into  context of  what was  happening around  George  around that  community  I think that  that particular  witness on the  stand that  talked about  being you know  having the  scissors in  one hand  her baby  in the other  and backed  into a corner  in a room  on the phone  with the dispatcher  and there's these  three guys in her  house just  stealing whatever  they want  that's the  reality of that  community  you know  your home  gets invaded  and if you  don't have  the means to  defend yourself  too bad 
[02:12:00]  and if you  backtrack from  the shooting  to what George  was doing that  evening  with that  hindsight  you could say  anything  what he should  have done  what he shouldn't  have done  this  but in  context  as he's  driving out  he sees this  why wouldn't  you do  something  why wouldn't  you call  the cops  and if the  shooting never  happened  like I said  you never  would have  heard of  this  it would  have been  George  calling the  cops  the cops  showing up  maybe talking 
[02:12:30]  to Trayvon  maybe not  you know  all that  would have  been fine  everything  leading up  to the  shooting  still  would have  been  completely  fine  why  because of  the  shooting  now I  understand  this sounds  weird  because of  the shooting  everything  before it  is bad  no  it  it  was  perfectly  reasonable  for a man  that's familiar  with what's  going on in  his neighborhood  to see an  anomaly  and go  I want to  look into  this  I want the  police to  look into  I wish there  were like an 
[02:13:00]  animation now  that trial  is over  so people  can understand  where he  was  where this  guy was  why that  was weird  that he  was there  how many  times the  homes around  where he  was standing  had been  broken into  and when  this notion  put this  notion  to rest  of following  hunting down  pursuing  stalking  whatever  because as  soon as  he gets  out of  his truck  and starts  walking in  the direction  where he  already saw  him ran  he says  I can't  see this  guy  he's gone  he ran  he took  off  that's it  so you can't  follow or  pursue or hunt  down  which you can't 
[02:13:30]  see  but in  hindsight  one thing  about hindsight  is that  when they  looked at  what Trey  Martin had  on him  he didn't  have  burglary  tools  and then  people  kind of  know  while he  left  the  all-star  game  was coming  back to  watch  he was  talking  to that  fucking  amazing  that he  could hold  a conversation  with that  racial  jantel  whatever  he was  talking  so when  you look  hindsight  shows us  that he  really wasn't  doing anything  while you  understand why  somebody might  go hey  what's he  doing  but he  really  wasn't  right  but I  think  that's  taking  like an 
[02:14:00]  extra step  and trying  to make  purple drink  we know  that now  yeah  but I mean  that's  kind of  like even  assuming  that George  would have  thought that  I don't  think he  thought that  I don't  think George  sees a  person  and has  an issue  with that  person  I think  George  sees his  neighbors  and takes  issue with  keeping them  safe  or their  homes not  invaded  more so  than this  guy's going  to burglarize  but he  might be  here to  rape  or he  might be  here to  be an  arsonist  or he  might be  here  like he's  not getting  into people's  heads  you know  but I  think he  just saw  this guy  around  these  homes  that had  been  victimized 
[02:14:30]  and  call the  cops  but in  fairness  that is  it's just  a different  way of  saying it  like that's  he  I understand  I don't  think he  was out  to fuck  I think  that he  cared about  his neighbors  however when  you care about  your neighbors  and you see  a guy there  who you  interpret as  obviously some  sort of  possible threat  to your neighbors  you are making  a judgment  on that person  because you're  interpreting  as a possible  if that was  a 75 year old  woman just  standing there  with a cane  it wouldn't  have struck him  so he did  make a snap  judgment  which again 
[02:15:00]  I get why  he made it  and I probably  would have made  the same one  why wouldn't  you look at  somebody  as suspicious  if he fits  the description  of people  that have  done  robberies  and burglaries  in the neighborhood  as opposed to  you know  if 12 times  an old woman  had broken  into that  then he absolutely  would have called  the cops  and I'm not  playing that 
[02:15:30]  I feel as  comfortable  with a young  Islamic guy  on a plane  I get why  profiling  means something  of course  and again  that word  profiling  I have to  just repeat  George called  the police  on white  people  Hispanic  people  black people  because a  garage door  was open  because kids  were playing  in the street  at a bad  corner  and somebody  might have  hit him  or whatever  he said  on many  of those  calls  I don't  want to  approach  these  people  I don't  want to  get near  them  there's  evidence  of that  if you  listen  to a lot  of those  calls 
[02:16:00]  I think  what was  clear  in that  community  was  the area  the geography  around where  Trayvon was  was kind of  and now there's  a fence there  but there wasn't  at the time  this was this  cut through  where a lot  of crime  came and went  and I don't  think he made  a judgment  so much  about Trayvon  just simply  being there  as much  as the NAACP  wants you to  think it's  because he was  black  or Al Sharpton  wants you to  think because  it's a hoodie  or whatever  it's because  those actual  homes that are  right there  really were  getting robbed  so people  in that  community 
[02:16:30]  I think  had a way  to go about  their life  and we know  now that  George probably  really did know  his neighbors  really well  because he  hadn't ever  seen that guy  before  and it turns  out he was  right  so that's  all he knew  about Trayvon  was that he  was a stranger  some guy  he'd never  seen before  and he is  around  if someone  pulls a fire  alarm  at the guy  that's in  the bathroom  and go  you look  like a trickster  to me  so it was  probably you  you go  and look  at who's  standing near  the fire  alarm  and I think  that that guy 
[02:17:00]  was just  standing near  the things  that had been  victimized  and that's  what was  profiled  was the  geography  however  it was a  couple days  after the  fire alarm  got pulled  it would be  a bit of  a different  story  if that was  in the moment  of a robbery  of course  I wouldn't  even be  saying that  but it  was  I think  again  what happened  we all  at least  common sense  dictates to  me why  he saw  Trayvon  and I know  George can't  come out  and say  this  and I don't  think he's  a terrible  person for  looking at  the reality  was in  that moment  Trayvon Martin  was doing  nothing wrong 
[02:17:30]  this is one  case where  I think if you  profile people  and by profile  you just mean  make a judgment  by looking at  somebody  according to  what other  people who  look like  that person  have done  and it's  accurate  because  positive  profiles  happen all  the time  nobody  minds  fucking  Dominican  pride  you know  but if you  say something  bad about  people hit it  personally I  think that  he made a  snap judgment  about a  guy who  in that  case just  was not  doing  anything  wrong  and that's  the danger  of it  is that  this type  of stuff  happens  where you  get a  guy who  just  wasn't 
[02:18:00]  doing  anything  wrong  right up  until he  punched him  in the face  the initial  contact  at the same  time  George wasn't  doing anything  wrong either  that's true  very true  yeah  yeah  well  so what  uh  wait I  gotta  I gotta  yeah  sure  not a  I guess  a strange  question  so the  verdict is  red and  they go to  George  okay you're  free to  go  how the  fuck does  he leave  I need  to know  how he  got out  of there  he went  um  the um  the  he had  been leaving 
[02:18:30]  through the  regular door  of the um  the courtroom  right  you know  when he  was uh  incarcerated  they bring  you through  a door  that you  know  kind of  leads you  through the  back  but it  turned out  this time  that's the  door he  went through  right  to go and  get secured  he couldn't  leave with  our parents  through the  regular door  of the  courtroom  I don't  mean the  courthouse  I mean  just the  courtroom  yeah so  he went  out a  separate  um  entrance  and then  what  what kind  of vehicle  did he  get it  because  I need  to know  I know  there were  all those  protesters  out there  and I  mean if  I was  in that  situation  they're  like  you're 
[02:19:00]  free  to go  I'd  be  like  well  wait  a minute  they took  care of  his  security  and that  was you  know  step one  is that  it didn't  matter  what  the  media  couldn't  figure out  what car  he was  in  that's  so  amazing  to me  in this  day and  age  can I  tell you  one thing  he should  do  for the  record  get rid  of that  gun  for real  have it  destroyed  and have  it  public  knowledge  because  that  becomes  a  trophy  for  anybody  who  wants  to  get  that  gun  and  make  a  statement  get 
[02:19:30]  rid  of  that  gun  you  got  to  get  a  new  gun  I  wouldn't  disagree  being  entitled  to  get  your  gun  or  other  property  back  is  different  from  him  having  some  kind  of  fixation  with  that  right  but  let  the  public  know  it's  gone  get  rid  because  then  somebody  all of a  sudden  is  like  hey  I  want  to  get  that  gun  in  honor  of  get  rid  of  this  this  is  the  only  time  I've  ever  disagreed  with  Robert  but  I  think  that  gun  is  the  last  thing  that's  going  to  keep  him  safe 
[02:20:00]  personally  no  it's  the  symbol  of  that  gun  I  understand  what  Jimmy's  saying  get rid  of that  gun  and if  you want  to  continue  to  carry  go get  another  one  get  a  gun  he  has  to  have  one  I  know  what  Jimmy's  saying  but  that  particular  gun  is  kind  of  a  target  in  a  weird  way  it  becomes  a  symbol  of  the  gun  that  they  can  write  some  asshole  and again  if you  go out  and you  harm  George Zimmerman  you're  an  asshole  and  somebody  wanted  to  harm  him  just  to  get  that  gun  that  shot  Trayvon  get rid  the  one  or  sell  fake  ones  on  ebay 
[02:20:30]  represent  them  to  be  people  that  but  you  got  to  realize  if  he  went  out  to  get  a  new  gun  it's  going  to  be  all  over  the  news  too  not  in  Florida  there's  no  registration  so  anybody  can buy  it  no  just  go buy  a gun  and as  long  as  you  give  it  seems  crazy  wow  Robert  so you  were in  New York  last night  yes  what do  you think  of all  the  protesters  marching  all  over  the  place  time  square  had  a lot  of  people  I  would  assume  you  were  close  to  time  square  last  time  I  was  and we  didn't  know  what was  happening  and  the 
[02:21:00]  driver  could  not  get  to  the  Fox  building  and  I  decided  with my  friend  who I  was  with  why  don't  we  get  out  and  walk  and  Fox  had  told  all  they  had  told  me  was  do  not  get  out  and  walk  before  this  because  I  didn't  know  if  it  was  for  time  or  what  they  didn't  tell  me  so  I  get  out  and  start  walking  and  I  look  down  6  and  I  see  people  backed  up  and  I  was  like  oh  shoot  that's  that  demonstration  so  Fox  took  really  good  care  of  me  they  came 
[02:21:30]  out  they  met  me  on  the  street  and  there  were  like  50  officers  that  ran  out  of  the  Fox  between  the  they  got  me  in  there  with  a  lot  of  security  and  out  of  there  through  side  doors  imagine  getting  caught  up  in  that  where  the  people  think  it's  like  hey  look  it's  it's  Robert  Hitler  coming  down  the  street  you  better  just  start  chanting  with  them  boo  George  you 
[02:22:00]  better  jump  right in  right  to the  Fox  door  yeah  so  he  should  get rid  of  that  I'm  going  to  get rid  of  the  gun  and  get  a  new  one  that's  a  bad  fucking  thing  to hold  on  to  how  was  the  family  parents  and  they  were  very  emotional  that  day  they  just  kind  of  rested  it  was  like  a  pajama  Sunday  you know  and  they're  also  getting  used  to  this  new  reality  where  they're  not  the  family 
[02:22:30]  of  the  accused  you know  they're  the  family  of the  exonerated  so  that's  different  and  I  think  they're  going  to  take  some  time  off  I  think  everybody's  going to  kind of  get away  for a  while  before  we  kind of  regroup  and go  from there  but just  kind of  get out  of town  until things  boil over  a little  bit  I think  that's  the smartest  thing to do  absolutely  lay low  relax  yeah  yeah  what  did you  think  of  the  lawyer's  job  obviously  they did  a great  job  amazing  job 
[02:23:00]  I  never  doubted  Mark's  presentation  ever  for a  second  I  never  doubted  Don  West  examination  of  very  technical  or more  sophisticated  things  in court  never  for a  second  enough  that I  got  here  because  I  knew  what  the  verdict  would  be  right  when I  saw  Mark's  closing  argument  and I  was  like  wow  this  is  like  brilliant  it  was  amazing  it  was  impressive  man  the  way  he  kept  on  that  jury  about  burden  of  proof  right  and  justification 
[02:23:30]  just  and  telling  them  look  you  can't  just  make  things  up  right  based  on  what  the  prosecution  and  then  he  would  give  them  the  evidence  now  here's  evidence  and  then  again  he'd  go  back  to  but  let's  remember  the  burden  of  proof  but  it  was  an  amazing  mix  of  everything  he  needed  to  tell  that  jury  and  then  even  the  rebuttal  by  the  prosecution  was  so  out  there  and  vague  and  you  know  there  was 
[02:24:00]  it  was  emotion  versus  facts  completely  yes  these  are  the  facts  this  is  what  was  not  proven  and  this  is  our  burden  in  this  country  and  then  here's  what  these  people  want  to  yell  and  scream  and  you  know  yeah  I  this  happened  what  if  no  they're  supposed  to be  the  ones  that  said  this  happened  could  it  have  been  the  sprinkler  could  it  have  been  it's  like  no  that's  where  you  decide  he kept  saying  you  decide  that  really  was  a  bad  you  know  I  thought  emotionally  he did  a good 
[02:24:30]  job  that's  you  right  there  that's  me  and  Chris  Cuomo  is  trying  to  get  me  he  did  try  to  get  you  I  watched  that  last  night  yeah  he  told  he  had  that  interview  with  Sean  Hannity  and that  was  presented  in court  as well  and I  don't  think  that  people  who  are  forthcoming  and forthright  with what  they do  and believe  they're doing  the right  thing  should  then go  back  that's  the way  we were  taught  always  as  children  if  you  do  the  right  thing  all  the  time  or  what  you  believe  to  be  right  you  don't  have  to  go  back  and  make  amends  for  that  and  say  it  should  have  been  this  way  if  it  should  have  been  that  way  now  and  you  can 
[02:25:00]  think  of  that  in hindsight  then it  should  have  been  that  way  then  will  George  carry a gun  now  I don't  know  you know  I heard  from  Piers Morgan  actually  last night  that his  gun was  returned  to him  or that  at least  he's  eligible  to have  it  returned  to him  I don't  know  that  he'll  carry  a gun  I  would  think  he was  trying 
[02:25:30]  to get  of course  he feels  regret  you know  one ever  wants to  end up  in this  situation  I found  interesting  because they  were a little  different  on that  issue  I think  his brother  was  seizing  upon  that  word  I think  there's  such  sensitivity  surrounding  all the  legalities  that are  going on  here  they wanted  to make  sure  he had  his  brother's  best  interest  regret  implies  regret  is  different  than  anymore  I  had  to do  this  or I  would  be  dead  I  had  to  do  this  action  to save  my  life  and I  really  regret  doing  it  because  that means  you shouldn't  have done  it  but you  can give  it  regret  as an  overall  I regret 
[02:26:00]  this whole  thing  I regret  the entire  day  happening  you can regret  something in the abstract  more importantly  we asked way better  questions than seeing  that  and there's  remorse  and feeling  sorrowful about  something  I think what  George said  there is that  he wished  there had been  some other  outcome  wishing is  fine  anything else  he could have  done  but this is  what had to  be done  what did  you think  when you  heard the  opening  joke  by the  defiant  like  as just  as people  in George's 
[02:26:30]  family  and the  attorney  did you guys  go oh my  there goes  the case  well we  understood  what he  was doing  then  Alan Dershowitz  said it was  grounds for a  I think he did  a mistrial  grounds for a  mistrial  in the first  sentence  so that was  kind of weird  for lack of  competent  counsel  but I  understood  what he was  trying to do  I think  those jurors  were  it wasn't  funny  and they  changed their  tone right  away  and I think  they got the  message loud  and clear  but yeah  it was a little  bizarre  yeah  and then he  had to say  come on  that's funny 
[02:27:00]  oh boy  never want to  have to say  that  what did you  think Chris  as an attorney  oh that is  definitely not  the way you  want to start  out a murder  two case  I mean  there's nothing  funny about it  and you don't  have a rapport  with the jury  yet on it  I mean it was  Don's only  mistake  I mean I  have immense  respect for him  but I was  watching that  live  and I saw  that  and I  I was like  holy shit  who was  you know  and it  scared the hell  out of me  and then 
[02:27:30]  you know  he calmed  down  I mean  a knock  knock joke  and then  I mean  he set it up  for about a half  hour  oh my god  the set up  went forever  it was just  poorly told  here's what he  should have done  as a comedian  who has bombed  many times  he should have  played that off  like he meant  it serious  like when it  but when it  bombed he should  have made it  look like he was  making an overall  statement  not like  knock knock  who's there  you know  you're on the  trial  whatever it  was he said  he should have  said  and that's  where we are  ladies and gentlemen  he should have  put his back  to some serious 
[02:28:00]  like yeah  like of course  I didn't mean  that humorously  oh boy  oof  yeah  it really  should have  been  if he was  going to  tell a joke  like that  it should have  been done  during jury  selection  right  right  during selection  maybe  it was just  and boy  thank god  the news  didn't show  it too much  it was all  they showed  over and  over again  can I be honest  there's something  beautiful about  what he said  this is where he  reacted like a  comedian  what nothing  nothing  what nothing  that's something  rich voss would  say in  connecticut 
[02:28:30]  what nothing  I don't blame  the media  for playing  that one  was way too  easy  over and over  again  Robert you  handled yourself  well in front  of the media  I mean all  these guys  gave you tough  questions and  stuff and I  thought you did  a great job  for your brother  what's going to  happen to you  now  do you want to  go into something  like that  I think after  tomorrow I'm  just going to  spend time at  home and  decompress and  relax and  reconnect and  reassess and  what do you do  for work now  before you finish  this  for free 
[02:29:00]  what did you  do before this  I was a  for hire musician  I worked under  contract for  an agency that  hired out  musicians and  sent them to  different venues  to do classical  music  what's your  instrument  voice tenor  wow really  so I have to  leave my  American spirits  out of the  picture now  I kind of  picked up that  habit a little  from all of  this  stress and  pressure  smoking  does rule 
[02:29:30]  when you're  stressed out  oh boy  yeah  oh man  well you  know I  gotta get you  over the  house to  sing some  karaoke with  me then  oh okay  awesome  awesome  it is a  yeah that is  a kind of a  cool place to  go and hang  out and just  lose yourself in a  sea of alcoholism  and vomit  listen  oh my god  I could see you  doing this for a  living man because  you handled yourself  well on tv  yeah very  given your opinions  on other things  I think that  there I think  George was  railroaded and  I feel um I 
[02:30:00]  think that what I  did in a word what  I tried to do was  advocacy and  hopefully you know  this doesn't happen  again but if it  does I will make  sure that that  person has an  advocate and  sometimes the best  advocate is an  attorney in the  legal sense and  there's also  advocacy in the  public realm  the rhetorical sense  and trying to make  sense out of  things for people  who are just  hearing one side  of something and  what I definitely  learned is never  ever allow there  to be a vacuum  just because the  black panthers are  trying to kill you  or whatever you 
[02:30:30]  know don't just let  other people fill in  the blanks for your  life or your loved  one's life you have  to be right there in  front when people are  calling you racist  and and the police  department racist and  everything else you  have to fight fire  with fire early early  and often  absolutely  uh what a contrast  you are from uh  frank taffy  yes  i know  i've heard  what's what's frank's  deal what's like his  history he's a good  he he has a good  heart yeah  he has um he's  lost two sons  yeah he's talked 
[02:31:00]  about that yeah  and i think that he  has also kind of  opened up about that  maybe he feels that  this is you know  kind of like he  sees george as his  son perhaps the one  he actually can  protect from  right uh his  his demise at the  hands of of uh  miss cory you know  or or whatever but  um he frank started  in a good place  and i think frank  is unique in that  he gets that  community he  actually lived there  his home was  actually burglarized  he'd actually see  the police take 
[02:31:30]  frank and george out  of it a community  of 200 homes in  13 months there's  400 calls to the  police  wow you do the  math and now  you'll start to  begin to understand  you know that like  how on edge people  were that live there  anyway you know  that that yeah  400 times in 13  months a community  of roughly 200  homes calls the  cops so that's  those cops are  going out there  all the time  yeah you come  home there's  cops you know  you leave for  work and one of  these cops at  somebody else's  house you might  uh get a call 
[02:32:00]  that your home  was burglarized  that day or  whatever you  know so i think  when frank was  particularly incensed  that the racial  narrative was uh  making traction  and and he for  the way he saw  it was nobody  really understands  retreat at  twin lakes and  what an awful  place this is to  live you know  this isn't a  real gated  community it's  just a very  normal right  right is the  community kind  of surrounded by  a crime ridden  area is that how  it works is it  because a lot of  times you find like  a nice neighborhood  kind of surrounded 
[02:32:30]  by a rougher  neighborhood my  my understanding  roughly is that  it kind of does  butt up on one  side against a  rougher neighborhood  and a lot of  uh people but not  all people but you  know would come  from that community  or kind of just  commit crime and  vanish into that  community right  um but you  know they they  they caught um  people in in in  the community  robbing from their  neighbors too so  it wasn't you know  necessarily that it  came from that but  yeah that was an  issue  more awkward  moments  can you turn  your head and  cough  epic fails 
[02:33:00]  that was a  shitty joke  that barbed  and fouled  mouth rants  why don't you  shut the fuck  up  coming up  opian anthony's  worst of 2013  continues  weird medicine  with dr steve  hairy anal  abscess  shitting liquid  sphincter muscles  reach down and  spread their ass  cheeks so then he  can stick his  finger in or use  a really cool  little device called  an anoscope  cram a bunch of  gauze in there  and then tape  their ass cheek  shut and tell  them not to  shit for a couple

[02:43:00]  from breaking bad  uh i was just saying i i saw the advanced copy  i've been fully involved in uh the show over the entire course of it  and then i i finally saw the uh the first episode of the new season without any spoilers or anything  i gotta tell you  wow  wow  i was sitting there just not wanting that screen to go dark and have the credits come up  oh  because now i gotta wait  and and the the the closing scene of that is just  it's brutal  it's it's subtle brutality 
[02:43:30]  yeah  because uh i mean walter gives that a threat it's a threat  yeah  i'll say that much but it's done in that inimitable quiet style  yeah  yeah  and as the hank's wife what role are you going to play in this i mean that things are going down  we know from last season of course hank took that dump and uh and and picked up that book  that pretty much revealed what was going on 
[02:44:00]  and now  um what do you mean what role am i going to you talk about his dump and then you ask me what role i'm going to play  i mean she changed my bedpan in season four but  he comes out of the the bathroom and then marie comes out she's washing her hands  you go through this uh series with uh you're very naive  what do you mean  i don't know you kind of you're not really willing to accept that something bad's going on  oh well is it is it  you just popped my bubble 
[02:44:30]  you just popped my bubble  i've been popping your bubble for six years  i know it's working and it's working  um i guess it's not that she's naive she just doesn't know  yeah but like like you got it  because who look at walt  yeah  like what sister-in-law would be like  i you know what i think  i think walt's a drug kingpin  all right  in his ugly ass shoes  in that  sick green car  he's clearly okay good point but you'd think being married to a dea guy maybe something would rub off or you'd get a little info or you'd you stay out of his work except when you're getting his rock 
[02:45:00]  i don't think marie stays out of anything  getting my rocks what  getting his rocks off  i don't think marie  no you can say that here  can you say motherfucker  motherfucker  that's you  it's fucking rocks  it's fucking minerals  they were minerals right  your rocks are here  they're fucking minerals  god damn  it's so good to not be on tv  and you can say fuck 
[02:45:30]  i know  i know  all i do like for the last like two weeks is not say fuck and not say the ending of breaking bad  right right  those are the two things you're not allowed to do  are we not supposed to say the ending  oh man  oh you can't  you're my wife  you can say whatever the fuck you  please say the ending  oh shit  i want to  i want to know it  no one wants to know it  but then don't want to know it  no  i want to see it  i know  i want to see it happen  you don't want to know it  no  do you know it  sometimes you guys don't know it  oh yeah we know it  oh yeah no we know it 
[02:46:00]  all right  sometimes you guys come in here from a series and you don't know for sure  what are they on with a meth  they know  it's uh  yeah this this is this is it  this is the the end  and and this  it it has to be a little  it has to be a little emotional right  oh man seriously  yeah  especially this week  sorry  yeah  i know  could you get me a coffee dean  could you order me a coffee  straight up  that's like that's how i do my liquor baby 
[02:46:30]  i'm good  yeah  you sure you're good  yeah i had a cup of coffee this morning  i had some chocolate with my real husband  oh damn  i didn't say that to be mean  but it sounded mean  and i didn't mean it  that's what you mean  you know i'm married in real life  oh man  off the show  you know that right  fuck  this is ruining everything  i'm so sorry  i need to tell you  i'm so sorry  it's a little late  hey but i'm always thinking  but i'm always thinking  about you baby  you're who i really love  when you play a couple  do you get 
[02:47:00]  is there any like  real attraction there  it's gotta be difficult  to not feel something  if you're playing a married couple  i don't feel  i feel absolutely nothing  not me  i feel it all  it's a job  they go cut  i run  i feel it all  no i miss you so much  in all seriousness  in all seriousness  i miss you so much  it was such an amazing thing  to have betsy brant play  play my wife  more than i can tell you  she just added so much  her inner like humanity  comes out in the role 
[02:47:30]  and it just  it's such a  it's such a  it's such a great thing  because i think it was such a  big part of hank's  like um  his own morality  you know  it stemmed  if he wasn't married  he would have  broke bad  a long time ago  yeah yeah  that feel  and i feel like  having betsy play  um  uh marie  just  it'll always be like  just a  an amazing part of  for me  a memory of the show  because she brought  all that to it  and it was like  oh man  it's just awesome  you make me cry  oh shush 
[02:48:00]  really you are  you make me cry  it does seem like  the only real  real true loyalty  you have  is to the family  to your family  yeah  and and that  pretty much holds you  from probably  yeah  going the way  of walter  going really bad  and he kind of  would just think back  at least i did  as a character  would always  in the kind of  crucial moments  and there are some  more crucial moments  coming up  oh damn it  um  would always just  think back to  to my wife  you know  and go all right  that's why i gotta be  strong and that's why  i gotta be the good guy  and yeah  and go from there 
[02:48:30]  i love that's true  i love being a part  of this couple  yeah  to and to do that  with you  you know  but even from  the beginning  i just  i love that  they would do  anything for each  other  and in this show  where people  are just horrible  to each other  and they decapitate  this guy  and stick his head  on a turtle  and we have  this beautiful  relationship  yin yang  i think  that's what  he is  in the middle  of all that  turmoil  i always loved  that  i always refer  back to a scene  where hank 
[02:49:00]  is basically  leaving the  dea  and he gets  his elevator  and you never  see him make  a phone call  or anything  but somehow  his wife just  knows it's a  bad day  and um  and she shows  up  and she shows  up  and i remember  on that day  like this  like a second  and i remember  i said just don't  look at me  until we do  the take  um  it was the only  time i said  some crazy  method acting  like that  but i did  because it was  such an emotional  moment 
[02:49:30]  and i just  couldn't  but as soon  as i looked  at her  it was just  you know  tears  you know  just because  you know  it's like  the worst  day  and he's  like fuck  and then he  and the elevator  opens and it's  his wife  you know  yeah yeah  wow that is  you know how hard  it was for me  in that moment  not to cry  and i remember  asking frida  who did our  makeup at the  time  i said  did we get  it did we  get it  did they tell  you we got  it  and he said  yes  and then i  just sobbed  which i did  a lot on the  show  because marie  doesn't let go  and cry  and also i think  in that moment  she just wouldn't  she's like no  it's all about 
[02:50:00]  you baby  you know  it's not  it's not about  me you know  it's not about  me crying  and it's you  know it's about  me being there  for you  yeah  awesome  wow that's  getting really  deep into your  your character  when you're  you're on set  like that  yeah  it was so fun  it was fun  i'm gonna miss it  when did you  when did you rap  how long ago  end of march  beginning of april  really  i honestly don't  even know  i feel like i'm  in this weird  wow man  time zone  that i really  don't even know  but i believe  that sounds right  what he says  sounds right  so you've been 
[02:50:30]  you've been doing  uh press and stuff  and and then i guess  that's kind of  wow and then you're  just you're done  it's crazy  it's kind of  hitting me now  this week  like when we  rapped i had to  go to another job  and so did you  so it was less  um i don't know  just i mean it was  yeah you were  kind of emotional  about it but it  wasn't this week  though it's like  this kind of final  victory tour you  know and it's like  yeah wait a minute  i'm not gonna see  i thought i was  doing better with it  than i am now  now that i'm like  wow last premiere  wait what do you  mean last 
[02:51:00]  yeah it's not  coming back  yeah we can fake  it though we can  like just make a  i asked him  i asked him  let's show it  again  i told amc last  night i said if  you bankroll it  i'll shoot three  more  we'll show up and  do the work  three more  who wouldn't  that's what i said  as long as they  bankroll it  i think a kind of  a goofy spinoff  where you're almost  like the new ropers  that way you go  from that  i get to wear a  caftan  i'm in  i love that  i love that 
[02:51:30]  oh i'm sorry  you're already on  another sitcom  my bad  oh that's right  i'm sorry you're  stuck in a bubble  that's a dumb  motherfucker  what is that  how do you do  that  how do you do  that  it's a bad  when you touch it  and it gets all  weird  steven spielberg  is that what  you're doing  you want to make  fun of steven  spielberg  and his tv show  how about  steven king  you want to make  fun of him too  no  no i'm not  making fun of  anybody dean  i'm just asking  about the special  effects  i can't watch 
[02:52:00]  that show at  night  really  really for real  i can't  i told my husband  i'm like we  cannot watch it  before we go to bed  too creepy  i can't  it just freaks me  out  if it's not  to be trapped  in there  well they're all  under there  so it's kind of  nice  i just got a pit  feeling in my stomach  a little microcosm  of humanity  under the dome  but you're stuck  you're all stuck  what you gonna do  with all that fuel  what you gonna do  stay tuned  what you gonna do  and betsy  you're working  with michael j fox  yes  that's got to be 
[02:52:30]  pretty damn cool  it's great  and now  easy  easy  easy  okay  thank you  temper that  easy  but he's pretty great  watch it  yeah  i know  do you just feel compelled  domestic violence  is like this  close  do you feel compelled  to just ask michael j fox  back to the future  questions  i would just ask him  that all the time  but how did this  how many delorians  were in that one scene  if you think about it 
[02:53:00]  you'd just be like  shut up  no i don't  but i do feel compelled  to go  sha la la la  all right  well the  that  from family ties  the theme song  yes  sha la la la  i hope you can get  the rights to that  otherwise this whole time  that is pretty good  that you two go from  breaking bad  to you know  other  hit shows  very hit show  yeah yeah  i mean come on  not too shabby  yeah  not too shabby  you're gonna have to  watch your language  i didn't know  yeah  yeah that's another thing  you're good at that 
[02:53:30]  yeah  yeah i'm pretty  you can't turn  to michael jay fox  and go  what the fuck  are you doing  like oh man  that is usually  how i talk to people  i think you confuse me  with my friend  dean norris  are you uh  normally uh  more reserved  or a little potty mouth  oh no i'm a potty mouth  are you  i try and keep it in check  with my children  yeah huh  how old are your kids  uh eight  and four and a half  oh yeah  those are those uh  very formative years  where they'll just  pick up everything right 
[02:54:00]  you know there's that time  where you're like  oh my my little boy  when he was a toddler  was like oh he's not  he's not listening  he's not talking  and then like he spilled  his sippy cup  and he goes god damn it  and i told my husband  i said it's not like  he's trying to say fork  and he says fuck  which we think is hilarious  you know  instead of sitting  he says shit  also really funny  there's plenty of videos  out there  yeah  cursing  and then i posted  on my facebook page  i go  my little boy said  uh god damn it  today  he totally gets 
[02:54:30]  that fucking shit  from my husband  it's a fucking shit  language  from my husband  so a little bit  of a potty mouth  yeah  a little bit  but i really try  and keep it in check  it's just sometimes  there's no better word  fuck's a great word  yeah  there's just no better word  it is  people should get off  their ass about it  too  right  fuck you man  it's a fucking great word  we were talking about  uh breaking bad  and how how it's  it's so good to have  these networks now  that allow real  gritty language 
[02:55:00]  like that  because years ago  you had tv shows  detective shows  or whatnot  and it just took  that edge off of it  dang it  yeah yeah  you'd be like  no one would  talk like that  it takes away  from the characters  absolutely  because they would  they would talk  like that  right  yeah  yeah  and uh  the hank character  is um  is great  and for the entire series  you're just like  come on  although you  you love  walter  you don't want him  getting caught  but you don't want  hank looking like 
[02:55:30]  a total idiot  but he doesn't  i mean  no that's just it  how amazing is that  great writer  you haven't caught him  and it's  and it's so  and you  clearly you're smart  your character is smart  thank you  your character is so smart  but he doesn't  fucking need that  like i need that from you  thanks  oh i thought i was  really stupid  thanks for like  well they do sound  married  i'm not gonna tell you  you're handsome anymore  yes you  no i know  i'm not sexy  no i'm not  oh come on  i can't help it  yes you're sexy  dean norris  oh god damn it 
[02:56:00]  you're so sexy  but seriously  how great is that writing  it is  that you can have  this whole cat and mouse thing  it works for both of you  right i always thought  that was really a  because he got me so close  and it made sense  he didn't quite get  and he figures out  gus fring  and he figures out  some other things  you know  but i thought it was  and sometimes it's funny  there's one scene  it's not a very popular scene  but where i'm almost  kind of catching him  and walt head  kind of squeals up next to me  and he kind of distracts me  and he does his little  kind of malcolm in the middle  thing  yeah  the malcolm in the middle guy 
[02:56:30]  he's like hey  and i was like  wow what the hell is this guy  you know  yeah  but uh  so there are times  where it's funny  that he  that hank doesn't catch him  and other times it's serious  but i always thought  it was good writing  that they got  absolutely  i do like when he pops in  with that malcolm in the middle  character  every so often  it's so goofy  it is  and then when you think  how ruthless he is  yeah  it makes it that much better  yeah  one of my favorite scenes  is when you're loading up  the bags in the car  and you say  what you got in here  a million bucks in cash  yeah  right  so funny 
[02:57:00]  yeah or when  you notice the  um  ww  the first time  and he just goes  you got me  and it's like  no it is him  yeah  come on  did you really want  to be killed off  in the first season  to do a comedy pilot  it wasn't the first season  it was  it was  i'll explain that  they picked up  um  the last season  and it was 16  instead of 13  so we go  okay great  they're gonna shoot  all 16  and then we'll be free  to do other stuff  and then the  you know  the corporate  can i say douchebags  yeah sure 
[02:57:30]  what are they gonna do  fire you  yeah  fuck them  so these douchebags  decide that  they're gonna split it  into two eight  things  for their own  financial purposes  sure  give me the fuck  about my financial reasons  so i gotta sit there  and wait  a whole year  because i can't do  anything else  because i'm contracted  to do a measly  eight more episodes  right  so i'm like  you know i got  i got a few kids  to feed myself  and i said  how about  it wouldn't be great  if the cliffhanger  of the first eight  since you're gonna  do it this way  uh  hank dies  that way it frees me up 
[02:58:00]  to do another show  and of course  they said no  because we need you  for the last eight  i'm glad they did  and they ultimately  did free me up  in time  and you too  to do another show  but originally  that wouldn't have  been the case  then you'd be  sitting on your ass  for another year  waiting for another  pilot  you know  that's gotta be  frustrating  so i was like  you know  i mean i love the show  and i'm down with art  and all that stuff  but you know  i act to live  i don't live to act  you know what i'm saying  i love that  you're such  an opposite  of some of the people  you've had through  that come through here 
[02:58:30]  paid the whole time  i'll do anything  i'll stay for four years  in the desert  just to do the last  eight episodes  i don't care  i'll starve  i'll starve  i'm like fuck it man  i need another job  pay me  called under the dome  cbs baby  yeah  under the dome  motherfucker  that's huge  that is huge  you were in  fucking total recall  i know i wasn't  you were  no  not you  before my time  you got a lot of nerve  sharing your face  around here  that's before my time  look who's talking 
[02:59:00]  that's the lot  you got a lot of nerve  sharing your face  who are you  in turn  believe it or not  i think i was probably  the highest paid  per line  because i had like  one line  and i was on that  movie for like  two months  this is back in the day  when they would take  like you know  they didn't give a shit  carolco was throwing  money out you know  and we're like  oh wow you're paying  me to sit here  for a month in a hotel  great  and then i go  and do one line  you know  i forgot what the line  was  i show up  i'm a SWAT team leader  and i show up  and i want to point the  gun at somebody  and say something  don't do it 
[02:59:30]  or something  how much did you get  paid per word  i'm saying  if you had two months  to pay for  you know  one word  that ain't bad  that ain't bad  yeah  no shit  bye  what else have you  like what did you  early on  work on  anything we'd know  i didn't  dig in  thank you  not you jimmy  you can find it  in video stores  if you know  what i'm saying  a lot of  some people call it  adult films  i call them  artists  that's how i met  dean  and he said 
[03:00:00]  let me get you  on the show  the show i'm doing  on cable  i did mostly  you know i did  some movies  but it's smaller  indie movies  i did one movie  with blythe danner  and peter fonda  which was really fun  and then i did  just a lot of  drama on tv  yeah  and it's like  once you start  doing drama  people choose that  and then you just  do more of it  but it was really  fun to do  you want some  lifetime movies  no  where the husband  all of a sudden  he's the greatest  guy in the world  and then oh boy 
[03:00:30]  no  and the best friend  always knows  he was a scumbag  right  no i never did  anything like that  but what i am  i am disappointed  i never did  that show with  david caruso  uh nypd  no no no  csi miami  csi miami  oh  i did nypd blue  the first season  with david caruso  yes  and i had  and i was ready  to go  that was one of my  that was my first  serious tv gig  and i had a contract  to go for the second  season  i'm like all excited  and i'm saying  over the summer  i hear fucking  caruso decides 
[03:01:00]  that he's gonna quit  and do movies  and do movies  jade  that worked out  for him  that was a good one  that was the worst  decision  that was worse  than fucking  mclean stevenson  leaving mash  that was a good one  that's probably  the worst decision  in the world  yeah  it's one of the ones  it's one of them  because i was his best friend  so my like six episodes  i was gonna do the next year  yeah your character  all of a sudden  becomes irrelevant  yeah  fuck  yeah  wow  that was early on  when that mattered  you know  yeah you're probably like  well that's it  i'll never act again  yeah  i'm never gonna get 
[03:01:30]  another gig  in my car  half the time  i've been in la  i've been on breaking bad  wow  not yeah  isn't that crazy  yeah  that's crazy  that's most of it  so i've really been  in new mexico  yeah  i know  betsy has to go  yeah that's  oh  betsy has to go  it sounds like i'd have to pee  you have to go  why does she have to go  is it my bubbles  she's still got bubbles  you're very uh  you're a busy girl  you're promoting  promoting  what's the name of the  michael j fox  show that michael j fox  show

[03:09:00]  happened in the  year of 2013  it was a year  that was a first  for the interns  of the Opie and Anthony  show  this summer we had  two stellar  and lovely interns  by the names  of Sidney and Jackie  they were probably  the most beloved interns  ever in the history  of the Opie and Anthony  show  well when their  internships ended  the hosts  the hosts  thanked these young  ladies  by having a lavish  and extravagant  farewell party  for each one of them  much to the dismay  of Sam  and the rest of the staff  Sidney is currently  working at 93X 
[03:09:30]  in Fort Myers  Florida  and Jackie's heard  on the Brother Wee show  up in Rochester  on 95.1 The Brew  they're doing pretty well  so join me  as we say goodbye  again  to Sidney and Jackie  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  on the Opie and Anthony  channel  we're losing Sidney  today  yeah  where is  you guys never go late  the beautiful Sidney  no we go late a lot  yeah  you wouldn't stay  for Ricky Gervais  well yeah  it's Ricky  what  seriously  Ricky Gervais 
[03:10:00]  Ricky Gervais  no we stay late  for the interns  what  every single time  it's simply the best  that's right  wow  there she is  oh man  wow  simply the best  absolutely  of course the song  we play for all the interns  to send them off  yes  to send them off  it's been a staple  for me  we always  have been getting  shat upon  for eight years  eight  well  years  my entire adult life 
[03:10:30]  I don't know  must be nice Sidney  Sidney  she's done an amazing job  that's right  as an intern for the Opie and Anthony show  what's your favorite thing that she's done  look  like I said before  when there's a well-oiled machine  because everybody knows what they're doing  you don't notice  you just know it works  it's not about specifics  so when I would look around and go  oh my god  I don't even have to notice that  this isn't happening  or that isn't happening  right  that's how you know that it's working  and it wouldn't be fair to the staff  if we point out 
[03:11:00]  you know  how amazing she's been  right  it's what you do though  what  everyone just knows  she was amazing  they don't want to make you feel bad  Sam  how come  no matter what the old interns  used to do  I'd be angry  and now  I'm not  I have one guess  with Sidney  and Jackie  like  like  I  you know  because they're doing a good  they're doing a good job  that's why  that's right  yeah  this is Sidney's last day  she's going back to Florida  to do radio 
[03:11:30]  yeah I got a job  you got a job  she's the first one  actually doing radio  after her internship  that is pretty cool  thank you  the first one  what are you going to be doing  I'm going to be doing  mostly like board hopping  and production stuff  well that's a foot in the door  right there  and then on  either Saturdays or Sundays  adorable foot  right in that door  a teeny teeny weeny  a tiny little  tiny little  foot of the door  kissable foot  right in the door  we were there for a second  what  just because it's her last day  doesn't mean you can start getting creepy  we're not being creepy 
[03:12:00]  we were talking about  foot in the door  right  just like anybody  that's right  so what's going on on the weekends  on the weekends  I get like a four hour show  whoa  you get your own show  whoa  that's pretty incredible  whoa  so your internship here  at the Opie and Anthony program  a plus in your life  or a minus  a definite plus  a solid plus  did you enjoy yourself  I did  how were your superiors  how did they treat you  with respect 
[03:12:30]  very respectful  very good  and your boss was Iraq  yes  was he a good boss  I would say so  wow  he was a lot of fun  can I ask you a question  Iraq fun  can I ask you a question  certainly  did you ever have to put shit on your head  that's a negative  I did not  did you ever have to grab into a toilet  I did not  and squish up duty  I hope none of this changes today  should I grab the shaving cream  and the razors  you like your eyebrows  I don't even know what you're talking about  you never had to have your eyebrows shaved 
[03:13:00]  no  nothing like that  we thought that kid was Hispanic  we were just doing him a favor  shaving the eyebrows  before they tattoo him back on  wow  this is so sad  oh look  here it is  balloons of course  Sydney  look  we got you  red white and blue balloons  balloons  Jackie this is exactly what's going to happen to you  when you leave us  yes  and you not so much  wherever you are  what channel does that kid work for  the boy intern just brought in 
[03:13:30]  he has to bring in the cake  and the balloons  and the balloons  and then Jackie walked in behind him  holding nothing  and just sat down  she's already worked hard today  exactly  insane  yes  I'll help you  aww  they're opening up the box  what does that say  good luck  Sydney  yes  oh my god  this is how you do things Sam  since when?  it's been a while  since  I don't know  at the beginning  we're finally seeing some results here  you know what happened  when I was an intern 
[03:14:00]  I didn't get a goodbye  and then I went back to Syracuse  and I called the show one time  Scorch  and you guys didn't take my phone call  that's what I  you remember that don't you  I just felt like  who is that guy  what was his name  and I just sat on hold  like we'll have to intern Sam  I'm back on the phone  they were like  yeah we're not taking that call  45 minutes  just pacing in my dorm room  Sam it's not about you  did you ever wear  an adorable little summer dress  like that?  no I could have fit in it  but I did not ever  you could have  back in the day  what kind of cake did we get?  I know 
[03:14:30]  but why don't you tell the people  what kind is it?  I don't know  why don't you cut into it  and see  why should I spoil the surprise  I know exactly  what kind of cake it is  I could use a little piece of cake  but I'd rather you  be surprised by what we got  she's got a handful  of red white and blue balloons  oh now they're on the mic  let me  oh  what's that  what's that  what's that  yes it is  I'm going to have to  take a picture  hold on  let's  who's that  get him out of there 
[03:15:00]  who  who  cut the cake  for everybody  who's cutting the cake  with his shaky hands  oh god  don't touch it  you're doing great  you're doing great  now and Sydney's  just condescendingly  telling him  he's doing a great job  I'm really excited  about this cake  I just want it  Sydney some thoughts  on your internship  some thoughts  oh I know  maybe some highlights  highlights  or any kind of thoughts  the fact that there even  were highlights to her  internship  which shows you how  unfair this whole thing  don't touch it  I think I got a great 
[03:15:30]  picture right there  yeah you're actually  just literally shoot  intern douchebag  out of the studio  wait are you guys sad  that you guys are  separating  Sydney and Jackie  are you sad  what a team you've made  you guys became friends  right  I'm coming to Florida  soon  I'm going to drive  to Florida  so I'll go see her  you guys are now  friends right  the people that work  here don't even  like each other  how can these two  like each other  because we're awesome  because we have a  very good work  environment  yes  yes  thank you  you know what 
[03:16:00]  sanity  the sweetness of the  cake represents  Sydney's tenure here  at the Opie and  Anthony show  but it's covering up  the bitter part of  you having to leave  us  very sad  very sad  it's very sweet  it's a sweet moment  she's supposed to  leave  none of you guys  notice her today  and then forget she  ever existed  by Monday  that's how this works  why don't you join  the haters on Twitter 
[03:16:30]  yeah  why don't you go  fucking join those  can we bounce you  no no  fucking blocking you  on Twitter today  you really are  you're a fucking  hater  negative Nelly  that hater hate  Iraq comments  get that shit out of you  she also wants to know  that when you're done  if you could take a  moment to take a photo  with her before you  of course  I'm surprised they  didn't ask her to  take a photo  I'm camera  I want a summer camp  photo I do want that  you do  I made sure  yeah we should  we do need one  their office was summer  camp and you guys  just let it be summer  camp  why 
[03:17:00]  I made sure I was  camera ready today  you did  I didn't take a picture  with Kennedy  I didn't take a picture  with any of the  Breaking Bad guys  no  I haven't taken a picture  in a week or so  because I didn't feel  like I was camera ready  but for you  I'm camera ready  thank you  which means that you knew  yesterday or this morning  I actually got the haircut  knowing this day was coming  oh wow  why would you know  when the last day was  it's so cute  because I checked the calendar  around here Sam  it's been circled  for months  since her last day was 
[03:17:30]  she didn't even know  what her last day was  we knew the whole time  yeah  we just knew in our hearts  yes  in our hearts  we felt the longing  knowing it was coming  we knew  oh Sydney  I only wish  the best for you  I hope this is a good one  I don't even think this show has this kind of budget  to bring cakes for the interns  of course it does  it's time we step up  we step up  and let the interns know  job well done  that's what I say  the cake is delicious 
[03:18:00]  the cake is freaking delicious  it is unbelievably good cake  it's wonderful  you're welcome  can't stop eating it  it's so wonderful  I mean this whole display  has been appalling  what?  as you eat her cake  it's good cake  as you eat her cake  hey jealous  you can't be upset  with a cake in your belly  that's how it works  words of wisdom  she's just too adorable  I know  Sydney final thoughts  final thoughts  yeah  that it was a very good way 
[03:18:30]  to spend the summer  and I'm glad everything  worked out the way it did  yeah  yes  so are we  and that  it was very fun  interning with you guys  oh  we're a delight  you know what  you are  this is so telling  it's been known for a long time  that we're just a delight  she looked at Opie and Anthony  yeah  and she said  it's been very nice  interning with you guys  yeah  of course  every other intern  what?  would shake  and say for you guys  uh huh 
[03:19:00]  because they've been conditioned  that you can't even make eye contact  with the talent  but we never said that  she's over there going  with my peers  Opie and Anthony  well sure  do you know what it's like  to walk through that door  every morning  yes  walk past  the campgrounds  and just look in  and say  and say  good morning  and get a little  good morning  hi  hello  it sets the tone  for my entire day  I have a really big  compliment  you don't even say  good morning to us  what? 
[03:19:30]  you know what happened  when you walked by  my office this morning  what?  you did this  uh  I did do that  I got a nice smile  and wave  oh yeah  good morning  maybe I had a burp  he was just getting rid of a burp  I get good mornings from Kenny  you do  and thank yous  of course  and you should  and you should  I think you had something else  you were going to say  that I  because he doesn't even talk to Tyler  he doesn't acknowledge Tyler  who does  I don't know who this Tyler guy is  but I get good mornings and thank yous  and I love it  aww 
[03:20:00]  you mean intern douchebag?  no I mean Tyler  Denny  grab a mic  Denny's here  don't grab one of the girls mics  no no  grab Sam  that's fine  that's just fine  no one's going to complain  whatever you learn here  forget  oh wow  Denny  these guys are the best  of course  Denny  she's going in the radio  for real  she's got her own show  not technically  she's got her own show  that's how it begins  with a part time position  I heard  we lose interns every semester  what? 
[03:20:30]  this is not an event  it's time though  it's long overdue  aww  it's long overdue  that we should have  acknowledged the interns earlier  right  and now we're just starting  a trend here  that's right  is it going to happen  from now on  yes  it might  Denny  you shouldn't talk  with cake in your mouth  and your microphone  Sam  you're right Denny  just make sure you  give it your all  give 110% every day  I usually give about 50  that's good enough  there's two of you 
[03:21:00]  50-50  that's 100%  give 110%  unless you're wearing  a sundress  and then 30 is fine  30 is a good day's work  that's the new math  you know that right  that's the new math  Denny  give her advice  she's working for  a modern music station  that's very good  playing contemporary  hit music I guess  right  CHR  CHR  is it CHR  it's modern music  do you know what  CHR means  contemporary hit music  contemporary hit music  did you know that  before he said that  no  that's okay  unless it's  you learn on the job  you learn  those are those 
[03:21:30]  things they teach you  at radio school  that don't even matter  right  CHR  yeah it's not  contemporary hit music  and everybody goes  yep  you're right  I didn't even notice  I didn't either  I was like  that's adorable  before she even  said anything  it was  correct  correctamundo  what's the slug line  for the station  it's like brand new 
[03:22:00]  it used to be  you'll learn that  the first day  it used to be  the rock station  I worked at  because I had the same  thing before I left  it'll be written down  somewhere for you  it's fine  you keep it on  a 3x5 index card  in front of you  make sure you  open and close  the microphone  with the call letters  the positioning statement  and just always  move forward  move forward  and stay abreast  of everything going on  in pop culture  like Sam does  I mean this guy  he just knows  everything about  pop culture  a lot of good  it's dummy too  too bad he's such 
[03:22:30]  an asshole  too bad his voice  is fucking horrid  right  Sam you know  what you need  a suit  tell me  a suit  and processing  right Denny  a little inside  lingo right there  a little reverb  make believe you're  in a gym or something  takes care of  a world of hurt  a little optimod  Sydney  yes  any chance  in the future  that you might  come back  and visit  if I'm invited  of course  let me tell you 
[03:23:00]  right now  open invite  anytime you're in town  for anything  come by  what do you think  the intern last semester  you shaved his eyebrows  and today you didn't  remember his name  did we literally  kick him out the door  at that point  with no eyebrows  what are you gonna do  it's on video  her eyebrows are too  pretty though  it's on video  that Anthony  didn't give a fuck  because I was  filming something  in the elevator  and it's like  well I'd love to  stick around  but the weekend  is here  that is true  it's me leaving  him in the elevator  with the intern 
[03:23:30]  well my truck  was out front  I had to go  I had to go  so you would  you'd visit  and stuff  of course  yay  of course  yeah  Jackie what about you  if you're back  always  yeah  yay  well you know what  you two always  have a home here  I don't even feel  like I have a home here  I think what we're  gonna do is  we're gonna take  a picture today  and we're gonna  fucking put that  picture right up  in the studio  somewhere  we should  to remember  the good times  we should  good times  great oldies  right Denny  I like that  I think it'll set 
[03:24:00]  I think it'll set  like the bar  for future interns  it's like  you gotta live up  to these two  and what they  accomplished here  yeah  alright  anything else for  Sydney  just uh  you know  keep uh  keep the enthusiasm  don't ever  don't ever lose that  stay golden  stay golden  I'm going to work  at a radio station  stay golden  you're very lucky  yeah I think  we wanna wrap this up  I just  I don't wanna overplay  this at all  no no  keep it subtle  yeah we wanna  just keep it subtle  keep the appreciation  it's pretty obvious 
[03:24:30]  how much we're gonna  miss her and stuff  there's a half dozen  balloons hanging off  one of the microphones  what  well sure  that looks really  uh  adorable  there was one more  but it popped  well it's right on the light  that's okay  do we have uh  music for Sydney  or anything  do we have  what do we got  any um  any music  yes of course  oh  of course  oh this is kind of sad  it's like touching  she's a rainbow though  we all know that  yes  she brought sunshine  into the studio  every day 
[03:25:00]  smiles  good luck to you  Sydney  you know how important  morale is to anything  let's hit the post here  yeah it's what's held  this show back for years  shut up  here's the post  hi girls  hi Jackie  hi Jackie's mom  we were looking  how you uh  you both like  walk down the hall  the same way  you laugh the same way  you certainly are  identical  this is creepy  yeah  we can make a lot  of money from you two  she what 
[03:25:30]  I'm sorry  Mike  what happened  what  you said she had  more experience  she didn't  oh well  you know  there's other  alternative words  to that  that I really  didn't want to say  but uh  you know  yeah we're nice  people here  yeah we  we have to be  uh  nice  uh you know  I would  you know  I  I would  oh my god  this is exactly  I just want to say  I would  Jackie was petrified  yesterday  well I'm just saying 
[03:26:00]  I would  that's a compliment  that is a compliment  I would  yeah  you know  if things were different  I would  if what was different  if they're just things  Jackie was saying  yesterday  that um  she  if her mom was single  she'd be pretty worried  about bringing her here  but you've been married  28 years  yeah  29 in August  29 in August  you got married young  obviously  20  right out of college  wow  are you gonna do that 
[03:26:30]  Jackie  you think  get married right out  of  look at her mom  it depends how this goes  no  look at her mom  shaking her head  no  don't like the boyfriend  basically she's saying  I made a huge mistake  don't do it  oh my god  I love you at all  but don't follow my path  you see her shaking her head  exactly  do you guys know  the horrible questions  you subjected my mother to  no 
[03:27:00]  no  I didn't  any thought of that  I didn't remember  remembering that  no  yeah no  no  they're just  I admitted I would  that's a little  that's a little edgy  no  no  no  not even close  not even close  oh it was pretty  yeah  Jackie's gotten some  very  she's been treated  very well here  on her internship  and Sam  like every intern  that's come before her  yes  no  just  just turn Sydney  Sam  Sam was an intern  when he started  with us  years and years ago  many many years ago  and uh 
[03:27:30]  he's resentful  that we finally decided  perhaps it's time  we treat the interns  a little better  than we have been  I don't understand  why he's so angry  with that  there's a third member  of the intern class  that is still treated  like the old regime  speaking of which  he happens to be a boy  but speaking of which  have him come in  have him come in  have him come in  so he could share  in this joy  actually he's coming in  with Jackie's cage  oh  there it is  yay  the cake  that's Jackie's 
[03:28:00]  thank you  I think he's interning too  we're not really sure  isn't this terrible  that twice  he's had to bring  balloons and cake in  for other interns  that are leaving  and knowing  he will not get the same  when he leaves  it's gonna be  bon voyage  sunny boy  whatever your name is  yeah whatever your name is  right  oh wait  is this a good cake  what does it say  yeah we  wow what does the cake say  I told him  I told him to write  something very nice  no Sam 
[03:28:30]  Sam told me yesterday  he asked if he could do  a little funny  mean joke  what does it say  that goes against  what I wanted  how dare you  now you  I mean  Roland said  okay what should we  make the cake say  so I said  I'll tell you exactly  what the cake should say  and what does it say  Jackie this is completely  ridiculous  oh no  it is ridiculous  that you're leaving  that's right  very good Sam  Sam  it's the perfect cake Sam  no  why would we want to  get rid of someone 
[03:29:00]  that is so good  that's ridiculous  that's not what I meant  that's  it's absolutely  what he meant  I think so  good choice of words  Sam  and we loved both  our interns this summer  three  but we might have liked  Jackie a little bit more  and with that  we got Ryan Starr  outside the studio  oh yes  oh you get a little  more than Sydney  what's up  that's Jackie  and Jackie's mom  and Jackie's mom  how are you doing Jackie  Jackie's our intern  and she's leaving  we're devastated 
[03:29:30]  could you like  serenade Jackie  in our last day  because  you know  Sydney  got to send off  with just a song  we decided  Jackie really  went over the top  why not get  Ryan Starr  to serenade you  on your last day here  if you will  Ryan do you have  a sweet song  maybe  a sweet song  for Jackie  and Jackie's mom  who's very  very doable  Jackie  I mean  who's a very nice lady  the best intern ever  I gotta say  it's always interesting 
[03:30:00]  on the road  because  it's fitting your mom  this year  because  I've been at shows  where moms  are holding signs  of like  I don't know  I don't know  why moms are there  but they say  my daughter  just turned 18  or whatever  oh man  it's really  it's wacky  it is like an offering  yes  you never know  and then  it's funny  because I'm  I'm getting  you know  I'm in my 30s now  so it's not like  I'm 18  so it's weird  so like  I can't tell  who I'm supposed  to be attracted to  the 40 year old mom 
[03:30:30]  or like  oh man  see  my friends say  both  yeah  both  Jackie  you shouldn't  talk like that  very good  no no  it's good thing  your mom's here  this is for Jackie  this is for Jackie  should I hit a chorus  should we just  should we just  get right to the point  here this is  clock's marching  at the double time  every dollar 
[03:31:00]  has become a dime  hearts breaking  at the speed of sound  you're falling down  all around  oh oh  bombs lighting up  the eastern sky  the back room deals  in the bottom line  the earth's shaking  but we don't know why  a million fires  oceans rise  oh oh  I leave it all  when I feel you near  what I'm saying  is I need you here  even though love  never seems to last  if you think  we got a chance 
[03:31:30]  stay a while  oh you got to  stay a while  oh oh  these days are wild  Jackie  won't you stay a while  I drop the needle  on the bell brigade  we slow dance  till the moonlight fades  I tell me now  that you never leave 
[03:32:00]  you always stay  here with me  oh oh  I'll keep you safe  from the circus show  the bullshit  and the blowing smoke  the knife hidden  under every sleeve  they stab your back  they watch you bleed  oh oh  they're gonna tell you  what you wanna hear  like  I could make you  a star next year  well  if New York City's  lights are so bright  how come so many  people crying tonight  stay a while  oh  you got to 
[03:32:30]  stay a while  oh oh  these days are wild  Jackie  won't you stay a while  yeah  oh oh  oh oh  oh oh  oh oh  oh oh  oh oh  oh oh  oh oh  let your hair fall  around your face  I would kill 
[03:33:00]  just to keep you safe  put your body  next to mine  sorry mom  just let go  and close your eyes  I shiver  when I feel  your skin  like a sinner  who's been forgiven  go on baby  shine your light  cause no one's  gonna find us  here tonight  stay a while  oh  you got to  stay a while  hey yo  these days are wild 
[03:33:30]  Jackie  won't you stay a while  oh  oh  wow  Jackie  where are you going  she's just going  my cheeks are shaking  that's amazing  she's just going back  to Rochester  that reminds me  of another intern  send off from  I don't  I don't remember 
[03:34:00]  remember when we  no  there was that  intern  yeah we've been  serenading the interns  for many many years now  there's a rock star  singing a ballad  to an intern  begging her to  say  oh my god  I will  it's happening  she said it  she said it  actually I'm looking  for an intern  oh  really  must have  passport  I have a passport  what is going on  wow  it sounds like  an abduction  and no record  no criminal record 
[03:34:30]  no criminal record  oh  that might be a  problem  no  no  there's not  stupid ride  star looks like  a serial killer  right now  or that's what's up  next  sounds like a  great proposition  nothing  I go back to  school  and that's  that's about it  school  yeah I can put  that off  I don't really  need school  I'm teeing her up  I'm teeing her up  for a job  alright  oh man  how did this  go for you  did you learn  a lot  did they teach  you all their  wisdom  I did  they taught me  all their wisdom  I learned a lot  Sam learned a lot 
[03:35:00]  you're really holding  a grudge from your  internship  it's a different  experience  Sam has the feeling  that perhaps we  didn't treat him  as nicely  when he was an  intern  or any other  intern  as we treat  Jackie  it's not just me  I speak for every  intern that ever  interned you  what are you talking  about  except for Jackie  you're the Martin  Luther King of  interns  come on  speak for  everybody  we judge the  interns on the  content of the  character  not the beauty  of I mean  the color of  their skin  he had a dream 
[03:35:30]  paid lunches  well Jackie  you know  sounds like you  should stick around  what more can we  say  good thing I have  to pack up the  car today  oh man  do you need  help  my last day  of my internship  I went to  Hooters  with Travis  one of the  worst meals  of my life  I've seen all  the different  clothes she wears  and the boxes  are going to be 
[03:36:00]  heavy  and of course  Jackie's mom's  not going to be  able to handle  the big heavy  boxes  so I figure  maybe I should  lend a hand  I guess you're  feeling helpful  of course  that's what a  gentleman does  yeah I know  but we're not  talking about a  gentleman  who's replacing  Jackie  oh god  no one  replaces  no one  there is no  one  I mean  there'll be  someone in her  place  but no one  will replace  Jackie  can we  possibly grab  a ray of  sunshine  and bring it  in the building  I think not  so replace 
[03:36:30]  no  no  would be  hilarious  though  if we got  two more  cute girls  next semester  and they  would be  like who  what  was it  remember  Sidney  who was  he  oh we've  cut the  cake  we've  serenaded  Jackie  and her  mom  it's much  later than  we would  have stayed  in any  other  circumstance  on a  Friday  before  vacation  and the  voice 
[03:37:00]  the glasses  I'm just  I'm happy  to be here  nobody else  I'd probably  pull myself  out of bed  that's not  see  look at  Jackie  he's not  talking about  us  he's talking  about you  oh no  Jackie  I'm glad  it was  beautiful  he was  talking about  her  amazing  Jackie's mom  does that  get you  going a little  bit  a little bit  senior daughter  being serenaded  by a rock star  alright  do we have  another song  for Jackie  oh we do 
[03:37:30]  what  she just got  serenaded  alright  what's the song  for Jackie  we'll just  play it  as we end  the show  oh okay  this is  e-rock  picked this  it's not  the one  from yesterday  right  no it's  you and I  talked about  it earlier  in the week  see  what  earlier  in the week  like this  I like  I like  prepping  for my radio  show  you've never  prepped  for your radio  show  you had to  call your  old boss  from 15  years ago  today  that's it  Jackie's mom 
[03:38:00]  thank you  line star  thank you  thank you  of course  yes  I'll bet  you  it's just  our job  to do that  with every  intern  and you  know  we don't  just go  oh  what about  mom  little mom  we got  some delicious  cake  we're going to  play this for  Jackie  and  very cool  the worst

[03:43:30]  knew why  Lou Reed was so famous  and what influence  he had on the music industry  and other musicians  so we needed to talk  to some experts  to explain this to us  so we got our old pal  Black Earl Douglas  and when that didn't work  we got our other old pal  Penn Jillette  here it is  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  what's Earl's tweet  you gotta do the first one  where he  he's gonna have  alright yeah  you know which one  yeah it's just so pretentious  because he is really acting  like he's  the Twitter account  for New Yorkers 
[03:44:00]  to follow  yeah here it is  R.I.P. Lou Reed  we'll have more later  lost for words  right now  he's always lost for words  and by the way  he's not lost for words  that's another one  of those dumb things  right  you have nothing to say  lost for words  that's poignant  that you're so grief stricken  you're lost for words  you can't even speak  yeah  you didn't know  the guy personally  how would you be  lost for words  and we'll have more later  as if you're the news source  yeah yeah  I better check in with Earl 
[03:44:30]  how many hours did he need  for the next tweet  about Lou Reed  he really thought it over  how long were his words  fucking gone for  yeah  well the first one  was 16 hours ago  okay  then he followed that up  16 hours ago  wait I thought he was  a little lost for words  he found him real quick  he found some words  so within the same hour  he found words  yes  oh okay  alright  thank god  and what was that  one of the best songs  ever  written  ever  ever  about New York 
[03:45:00]  love you Lou  you've earned your rest  no one wants to earn  their rest  you want to earn your rest  if you're able to wake up  at some point  yeah of course  fuck  love you Lou  love you Lou  you've earned your rest  earned your rest  do you think Lou's  fucking reading Twitter  reading Earl's Twitter  oh good  that's like saying  it's Jim Nortoning  stop romanticizing death  yeah  earn your rest  well you just tuckered out  from not singing 
[03:45:30]  yes he's reading Twitter  and then saying  oh good  Earl Douglas loved me  Earl says I could  fucking relax now  sweet Jane  uh  what song did he mean  was one of the best songs  written ever  about New York  NYC man  oh god  I never heard that  do you have that  let's hear  oh this was another  song about New York  what Earl says  is a  how long is this  piece of shit  what year is this  uh  it's from his  1996 album  oh wow  okay 
[03:46:00]  Mary's different  it's a new  newer song  decide to walk  the streets of New York  again  yeah  to see things  we can't possibly  have seen ourselves  get ready to be  enlightened about New York  alright this is some  jazz shit  right here  you like jazz  I love it  it's my favorite type  music  it can only lead to trouble 
[03:46:30]  if you break my heart  accidentally crush it  on the lights of March  no  I prefer you  watch straight forward  you don't have to go  through all of that  I'm a New York City man  say go and that is that  New York City man  you just say go and that is that  I'm a New York City man 
[03:47:00]  you just say go and that is that  you just say go and that is that  Earl's an idiot  how does Earl say this is the 
[03:47:30]  best song about New York  that  that  was ever  ever written  ever  it's not  yeah yeah  New York State of Mind  Billy Joel  New York New York  New York  come on  there's plenty of New York songs  that  this isn't even the top million 
[03:48:00]  you know Anthony Mood  if he's preferring a Jay-Z song  it's not Jay-Z's version  I like  this is not the best song  about New York ever  she's singing  this isn't even close  oh look he's all over the TV  we got Black Earl on the line  our old pal  what's up Earl  hey guys how are you doing  well we're all mourning the  the passing of Lou Reed  the untimely passing  the untimely passing of Lou Reed 
[03:48:30]  and I know you were a big  Lou Reed fan  could tell by the Twitter  yep  yeah  I love the guy  love love  what do you like  what do you like about him  um  just really  he  he was the street  he was the street  to the core man  yeah man  mmm  true that  how  how is he street  I don't know what that means  he was like part of  the New York City fabric  right Earl  oh  well yeah 
[03:49:00]  he was New York  when you think New York  you think Lou Reed  well he's also  you know  he brought a real sense  of realism  to  to the music  absolutely  explain that further  music was real  I mean  I mean  think about it  before Lou Reed  you didn't have  really  like really  deep songs  about drugs  about  yeah 
[03:49:30]  Rolling Stones  weren't into that at all  yeah  dead neither  but you liked his  you liked lyrically  what he did  he really  he really delved  into that drug culture  like no  like no one else  yeah  is that what you're saying  yeah  Earl  oh guys  you'll bring it up  for a second  see that's one of the things  he does  I have a million  phone calls  where Earl goes  you'll bring it up  nothing changing  Earl 
[03:50:00]  he really  he really tackled  the drug culture  in his songs  I said  explain that further  please  thanks  think about a song  like heroin  think about a song  like waiting for the man  thinking about  uh  just trying to think  something else  um  off the top of my head  well we're thinking about it  oh even you know  walk on the wild side  obviously  oh yeah  yeah  there was  I never heard that  there was some drug action  in that song as well 
[03:50:30]  and what about  New York  uh  New York Man  oh New York City Man  I think it's  New York City Man  written about New York  why is it the best song  written about New York  in your words  a lot of New York  songs out there  yep  well just  you know  first of all  it's a fantastic song  it's just a  what makes it a fantastic song  Earl  what makes it a fantastic song  you can't just say 
[03:51:00]  it's a fantastic song  what makes it a fantastic song  Earl  Earl  Earl  comment  Earl  Earl  hello  Earl  what are you doing  Earl  we know you're still there  what's going on  Earl 
[03:51:30]  Earl  Earl  Earl  hello  he didn't hang up  maybe someone  sprayed some Febreze  and he passed out  like those sheep  Earl  the sleeping sheep  can we call Earl  Earl  remember he used to just  pass out  yes  Earl  can we call Earl 
[03:52:00]  back  and now  and now he hangs up  he's at a lost force  he is at a lost force  it's always the second question  that always has gotten him  throws him  that's why I was laughing so much  because  you go  okay  you like Lou Reed  yes  well what song  well I mean  you know  even take a walk  on the wild side  well why  oh you're breaking up  he reiterates the same thing  he said in his Twitter  yeah it's the best  it's the best song  here comes Earl 
[03:52:30]  alright  make him believe  that he couldn't hear us  yeah  Earl  Earl Lee  yo  why is that a great  song about New York  great song about New York  um  uh  it's very literate  it has you know  historical references  both in literature  what  what historical  uh references  uh  quotes  you know  Shakespeare  quotes  uh  quotes  Shakespeare is of course  a grand New Yorker  no he's not  yeah wouldn't that be a great 
[03:53:00]  Shakespeare song then  what  what makes it such a great  New York song  because there's a lot of  songs that have been  written about New York  over the years  well I understand that  but um  I don't know  I like the feel of it  I like the energy of it  it's kind of  it's kind of  different for Lou  because it was kind of  a laid back song  almost sentimental  because he was  he was hardly sentimental  really  hmm  what do you mean  about sentimental  the fact that  he was born in Brooklyn  and he's  singing about 
[03:53:30]  New York City  well  no  that's sentimental  in the sense  that  let's say  uh  Earl  your Twitter said  you're a huge  Lou Reed fan  yes  I'm a huge  Lou Reed fan  I went to it  two and a half hours ago  so I'm not  sharp as the name  right now  up just reflecting  a little  still  self-reflection  still a little too  emotional right now  lost for words  lost for words 
[03:54:00]  the old  lost for words  yeah  well  you know  it must be great  to live your life  with that  moniker  I'm not a loss  for words  lost for words  what uh  you're gonna be on  with Ronnie today  talk a little  about Lou  yeah I hope so  I'd like to hear that  yeah  yeah I mean  I know he's  you know  I know he's very  upset about it  oh have you spoken  to him  uh not yet  no  so how do you know  he's very upset  about it 
[03:54:30]  um  he's a big  as big a fan  as I was  well and you're  I find that hard  to believe  and you're  and you're  a huge fan  he doesn't know  at all  big uh  Lou Reed  fan  on the phone  Earl Douglas  oh I  I got one  um  cause this is one  thing we discussed  earlier we don't  understand  like a lot of  people  say that  that Lou Reed  was very influential  in their careers 
[03:55:00]  why is that  go  well influential  in the sense  that  you know  he brought  an avant-garde  sense to the music  he brought  I think it  brought realism  to lyrics  um  on top of  everything else  fantastic guitar  player too  okay  how about the singing  singing  um  well  you  you didn't  you know  like Dylan  you didn't  necessarily have to  be a virtuoso 
[03:55:30]  to be  fantastic singer  that's true  Dylan though  I at least sang  Dylan did do a lot  of singing  Lou Reed kind of  talk sings  yeah he kind of  more talks  yeah it was like  more talking  but it was also  like what we're doing  right now could be  a Lou Reed song  right  wow  very good Jimmy  you know  he just brought  this kind of  it was almost  it wasn't quite  spoken word  but it was also  very rock and roll  in the sense  that you know 
[03:56:00]  it kept it simple  it was always  two guitars  bass drums  not a lot of  chord changes  but the thing is  now Earl  I've heard  Lou Reed  everyone's talking  about him today  god bless  but I've heard  Lou Reed  described as like  the godfather  of punk  right  of punk  I don't really  if I listen to  any of his songs  even the live versions  I'm not hearing  much punk  sounding music  there  how is that  how is that 
[03:56:30]  title given to him  well he sang  about trannies  so that's kind  of punkish  well  no one else  was singing  about trannies  I'm not feeling  like you know  when you listen  to something  like the  dead  kennedys  things like  that  even the  clash  you know  maybe it  wasn't the  punk sound  maybe it  was the  well Earl  why don't you  explain  well we can do  it now  like rock and roll  animals  sure  sex pistols  but we were  listening to  some of that  we were actually  listening to  Sweet Jane  off of that  album  and though 
[03:57:00]  I found the  music very  interesting  and very  good and  melodic  again  not much  punk sound  there  well I don't  know if it was  punk in sound  as much as  punk in attitude  volume  it is  keeping it  simple  loud  punk wasn't  known to  keep it really  simple  I kind of  like you know  when you're  getting a  brick  punk  thrown at  you  I don't  know if  that's  simple  safety pins  through the  cheeks  I don't  know if 
[03:57:30]  that's  keeping it  simple  sex pistols  you're talking  attitude  as far as  musical  approach  most punk  bands  probably  some of the  first songs  they learned  were Velvet  Underground songs  so they're very  basic to learn  they would  one or two  chords  what's a big  Velvet Underground  song Earl  obviously  Sweet Jane  White Light  White Heat  Waiting for the  Man  Femme Fatale  Venus at First  right  blue  pale blue eyes  Earl you're doing 
[03:58:00]  Lou Reed proud  today  there's one other  thing  people are talking  today about how  he you know  didn't give a crap  about commercial  success  you want to  discuss that a  little bit  with comment  Earl  a little bit  today  well he didn't  necessarily  adhere to  trends  he didn't  have to  you know  there was no  dance remixes  there weren't  any  movie  disco  songs  there weren't  any  Lou Reed  you know  bubblegum pop  he kind of  followed this  his own path 
[03:58:30]  that sort of  trailblazer does  play his own path  unless he's selling  Honda scooters  uh oh  oh no  yeah but  you know what though  at the time  even that was  kind of  it was  looped  because  looped  uh oh  there he is  blending his  uh  this is the  epitome  of selling out  by the way  this is punk  right here  using your  like a dance  remix a little bit 
[03:59:00]  using your hit song  to sell some  corporate project  man  look fine  hey  don't settle  for walk  oh  oh  he's sitting  on a scooter  hey don't  settle for walking  there's a guy  that didn't want  commercials  or didn't care  about commercial  success  but used my  hit song  to sell  Honda scooters  a couple of  bucks  they probably  offered him  a lot of  money right  there  right  you know  as soon as he 
[03:59:30]  saw how much  he was going  to make  oh he gave  a shit  all those  fucking  punk  principles  go out  the fucking  window  blaze that  trail  on a  Honda scooter  right  why did he  tell the man  to go fuck  himself  Earl  but look at  it this way  Johnny Rotten  sold butter  you know  how many  commercials  are the  class songs  in  I don't  particularly  mind when  music is used  in a commercial  I don't mind  either  I think it's  a silly  thing that  people put  on artists  don't use  your music  for commercials  there was a  time it was  very taboo 
[04:00:00]  and they  didn't do  it  yeah not  so much  anymore  that's  true  especially  since music  is being  stolen now  so much  online  all that  shit  it's like  hey man  these guys  are going  to make  fucking  a couple  million  let them  get  you get  a nice  payday  well Earl  your reflections  on Lou Reed  have been  terrific today  I'm hearing  from people  here  let's see  can Earl  and Sal  get a show  together  just call it  hipster  bullshit  hmm  what the hell  is that about  it's not my  opinion Earl  not mine either  it's obviously  a horrible 
[04:00:30]  person  I love Earl  I think you filled  in the blanks  perfectly today  because we're not  big Lou Reed  fans here  so now we  needed an  education  now we have a little  more knowledge  on the whole  thing  a little  education  Earl  I love  Earl  Earl rules  I like throwing  the ball around  with Earl  just tossing it  around  with Earl  on the phones  alright Earl  good stuff  today buddy  love you  miss you  call up  Ronnie later  I want to hear  that exchange  yes  alright  Ronnie will be  all about Lou Reed 
[04:01:00]  today  yeah  in a very  brilliant way  I'm sure  in a serious way  I did a real  tough one last  week  I didn't hear it  yet  yeah it's real  tough  because it was  the day I found  out Lou Reed  died  I was going to  ask you about  that really fast  I know you got  to go  I swear to you  we don't  understand Lou Reed  yeah  so give me a  minute or two  on Lou Reed  I will  I will  what Lou Reed  did  was he  he  he synthesized 
[04:01:30]  the New York  hardcore  art scene  pop art scene  the Andy Warhol  scene  added to that  kind of Delmore  Schwartz  straightforward  short story  writing  that put a  different point  of view  from rock and  roll  rock and roll  had to that  point  always been  I love you  my boyfriend  did this  this happened  but he brought  in that kind  of Delmore  Schwartz  straight recording  put really  nice pop 
[04:02:00]  hooks to it  and then brought  in experimental  noise music  and put that  all together  what you want  in art  and I say this  all over and over  about director's cut  you know the  crowdfunding thing  you want to have  in any art  the visceral  and the intellectual  collide  as hard as they can  you want your mind  and your guts  to be fighting  when you're on  a roller coaster  your guts say  we're gonna die  right now  and your intellect  says  you know  if they killed  someone every time 
[04:02:30]  their insurance  rates  makes me too high  you know  and those two  things fight  and that's where  the joy comes  Lou put together  a band  they were bands  that did noise  you know  and there were  smart bands  and there were  pop bands  but he brought  together  the idea  that smart people  could be down  and dirty  and the combination  of intelligence  and simplicity  really does create  the whole punk  movement  that's gonna go  beyond that  you know  when you listen  to the clash  or any of those  bands  you have this 
[04:03:00]  driving stupid  you know  it's college kids  meeting bikers  is what it really is  and Lou brought  that together  used that  monotone singing  to give you the idea  it was a short story  and then took  Phil Spector's  wall of sound  and turned it  completely inside out  and turned it into  something menacing  as opposed to  something comforting  see that's how I felt  about the Bay City Rollers  the same type of  what song would you 
[04:03:30]  suggest by Lou Reed  for people that  don't know him  well you know  not Walk in the Wild  Side which we all  know  you all know  Walk in the Wild  Side which is  you know  give me one song  because I'm not  I like a few of his  songs yes  but I don't go deep  with Lou Reed  I'm gonna give you  a hard one  I'll give you  a really hard one  it's 11 minutes long  okay  it's a trilogy  and it's called  Street Hassle  Street Hassle  yeah  and the first line  of it is  that cunt's not  breathing  I think she's  had too much  or something  or other  hey man  you know  what I mean  it's about  having a dead  girl from drugs  in the apartment 
[04:04:00]  and having to  bring her out  into the street  that is a hassle  Street Hassle  and it breaks  it into three parts  and just to bring  a little jersey in  Springsteen does  the little monologue  in the center  no kidding  Street Hassle  is so smart  so visceral  so powerful  and just so great  and then I would  also  you must listen  to New York  you know  the New York  album  Romeo  had a Juliet  and a Dirty Boulevard  those songs 
[04:04:30]  the narrator  you know  it's this  nutty thing  that Lou got to do  everybody else  when there's huge  loud music  behind them  would of course  scream  yeah  everybody was a screamer  and his idea  of having this huge  attack of sound  and then going  and you know  was a really  this is the first  time it's been put  in this context  but you have to  remember also  this is a big mistake  do you feel guilty  now  this is a big  this is a big  big  this is a big 
[04:05:00]  big mistake  moment right now  is that if you  listen to Lenny Bruce  right now  the Carnegie Hall  concert  if you listen to  that record  you will say  if you're honest  what's the big  fucking deal  you're not that  not that funny  not that surprising  I'm one of those  guys  not that anything  right  because I love  comedy  so I listen to  old Lenny Bruce  stuff  I don't get it  and the lingo  takes me out of it  but you know  why you don't get it  yes  is because  it's become  everything around you  the idea  of talking 
[04:05:30]  first person  about your real life  with the sadness  and getting comedy  out of that  is invented  by Lenny Bruce  yeah  you do it  every fucking day  I would postulate  you might not  be doing it  if not for Lenny  but it becomes  so absorbed  into our culture  that you can't  see the novels  it's not a big deal  anymore  at the time  it sent him to jail  right  you know  but when everybody  else was coming  on the stage  and going  does your wife  shop too much  he came on the stage 
[04:06:00]  and said  my wife filed  for divorce today  and ah  that's like  what are you talking  about  that's a huge difference  his first person  was real first person  and he invented  this American art form  so Lenny Bruce  I love playing  Lenny Bruce  to people  who are in their 20s  and going  what do you think  of this  just a hack comic  nothing special  nothing special  at all  well let me tell you  you don't have  George Carlin  you don't have  Pryor  you don't have  Louis C.K  none of those people 
[04:06:30]  exist if not for this  so I agree with you  if you're looking  to just put on  a Lenny Bruce record  and just be taken  away with it  you're not going  to get that  you know  there's a famous  quote from  Brian Eno  and I won't get it  word for word  that only 30,000 people  or 3,000 people  bought the first  Velvet Underground  record  but every one of those  people started a band  I mean you don't have  David Bowie  without Lou Reed  at all  you don't have  Iggy Pop  without Lou Reed  you certainly don't have 
[04:07:00]  Nirvana  you certainly don't have  any of the 90s stuff  you certainly don't have  U2  all of those people  and they all acknowledge this  I'm not saying that  and the reason is  the balls it took  to say  instead of talking about  how I miss my girlfriend  I'm going to talk about  what I saw happening  on the streets of New York  instead of talking about  candidly  you know  sneakily  about  we went to  Ichiku Park  we got high  instead of doing that 
[04:07:30]  I'm going to say  heroin  when the blood  shoots up the dropper's neck  I feel just like  Jesus' son  you know  that kind of reporting  is a whole different thing  all of a sudden  it got really wicked real  and  would someone else  have come along  and done that  almost certainly  but Lou did  when you're the first  yeah  Lou was the first  and you know  he's also  I must add  a very good friend of mine  and  you guys were close  huh  yeah  really  really smart 
[04:08:00]  and just  rocked like a motherfucker  and  such a sense of all that  but it's exactly true  if you'd have heard  the Velvet Underground  in  68  69  your reaction would have been  what the fuck is this  you might have hated it  most likely would have hated it  but you certainly would have got a  what the fuck  now you hear it now  and go  this sounds like every single thing  on the radio  and I would say  that's precisely my point  precisely my point  you know  oh yeah

[04:13:00]  for the interns  of the Opie and Anthony  show  this summer we had  two stellar and  lovely interns  by the names of  Sydney and Jackie  they were probably  the most beloved  interns  ever in the history  of the Opie and  Anthony show  well when their  internships ended  the hosts  the hosts  thanked these  young ladies  by having a lavish  and extravagant  farewell party  for each one of them  much to the dismay  of Sam  and the rest of the staff  Sydney is currently  working at 93X  in Fort Myers  Florida  and Jackie's  heard on the  Brother Wee show  up in Rochester 
[04:13:30]  on 95.1 The Brew  they're doing pretty well  so join me  as we say goodbye  again  to Sydney and Jackie  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  on the Opie and  Anthony channel  we're losing Sydney  today  yeah where is  Sydney's last day  you guys never go  late  the beautiful Sydney  no we go late a lot  yeah  you wouldn't stay  for Ricky Gervais  well yeah  it's Ricky  what  seriously  Ricky Gervais  Ricky Gervais  no we stay late  for the interns  what 
[04:14:00]  every single time  you're simply the best  that's right  wow  there she is  oh man  wow  simply the best  absolutely  of course the song  we play for all the interns  to send them off  yes  to send them off  it's been a staple for  we always  have been getting  shadowpun for eight years  eight  well  years  my entire adult life  I don't know  must be nice Sydney  Sydney  she's done an amazing job 
[04:14:30]  that's right  as an intern for the  Opie and Anthony show  what's your favorite thing  that she's done  look  like I said before  when there's a well-oiled machine  because everybody knows  what they're doing  you don't notice  you just know it works  it's not about the specifics  so when I would look around  and go  oh my god  I don't even have to notice  that this isn't happening  or that isn't happening  right  that's how  you know that  it's working  and it wouldn't be fair  to the staff  if we point out  you know  how amazing she's been  right  it's what you do though  what  everyone just knows 
[04:15:00]  she was amazing  they don't want to make you  feel bad Sam  how come  no matter what  the old interns  used to do  I'd be angry  and now  I'm not  I have one  with Sydney  and Jackie  like  like  I  you know  because they're doing  a good job  that's why  that's right  this is Sydney's last day  she's going back to Florida  to do radio  yeah I got a job  you got a job  she's the first one  actually doing radio  after her internship 
[04:15:30]  that is pretty cool  thank you  the first one  what are you going to be doing  I'm going to be doing  mostly like board opping  and production stuff  well that's a foot in the door  right there  and then on  either Saturdays or Sundays  cute adorable foot  right in that door  a teeny teeny weeny  a tiny little  tiny little  foot in the door  kissable foot  right in the door  you were there for a second  what  just because it's your last day  doesn't mean you can start  getting creepy  we're not being creepy  we were talking about  foot in the door  right  just like anybody 
[04:16:00]  that's right  so what's going on  on the weekends  on the weekends  I get like a four hour show  whoa  you get your own show  whoa  that's pretty incredible  whoa  I'm pretty excited  so uh  your internship here  at the Opie and Anthony program  um  a plus in your life  or a minus  a definite plus  yes  a solid plus  did you enjoy yourself  I did  how were your superiors  how did they treat you  with respect  very respectful  very good  and your boss was Iraq  yes  was he a good boss 
[04:16:30]  I would say so  wow  he was a lot of fun  can I ask you a question  what  Iraq fun  can I ask you a question  certainly  did you ever have to put shit  on your head  that's a negative  I did not  did you ever have to grab  into a toilet  I did not  and squish up duty  I hope none of this changes  today  should I grab the shaving cream  and the razors  you like your eyebrows  I don't even know  what you're talking about  you never had to have  your eyebrows shaved  no  nothing like that  we thought that kid 
[04:17:00]  was hispanic  we were just doing him a favor  shaving the eyebrows  before they tattoo them  back on  wow  this is um  so sad  oh look  oh wow  here it is  of course  Sydney  look  we got you  red white and blue balloons  balloons  Jackie  this is exactly  what's going to happen to you  when you leave us  yes  you not so much  wherever you are  what challenge  does that kid work for  the boy intern  just brought in  the cake  he has to bring in  the cake  and the balloons  and the balloons 
[04:17:30]  and then Jackie  walked in behind him  holding nothing  and just sat down  she's already worked  hard today  exactly  insane  yes  I'll help you  aww  they're opening up  the box  what does that say  good luck  Sydney  yes  oh my god  this is how you do  things Sam  since when  it's been a while  since  I don't know  the beginning  we're finally seeing  some results here  for a long time  when I was an intern  I didn't get a goodbye  and then I went back  to Syracuse 
[04:18:00]  and I called the show  one time  Scorch  and you guys didn't  take my phone call  you remember that  don't you  I felt like  who was that guy  what was his name  and I just sat on hold  like what  the intern Sam  I'm back on the phone  they were like  yeah we're not  taking that call  45 minutes  just pacing in my dorm room  did you ever wear  an adorable little  summer dress like that  no I could have  fit in it  but I did not  you could have  back in the day  what kind of cake  did we get  I know  but why don't you  tell the people  what kind is it  I don't know  why don't you  cut into it 
[04:18:30]  and see  why should I  spoil the surprise  I know exactly  what kind of cake  I could use  a little piece of cake  but I'd rather you  be surprised  by what we got  she's got a handful  of red white  and blue balloons  oh now they're  on the mic  what's that  it's a kind of cake  what's that  yes it is  I'm going to have  to take a picture  hold on  let's  get him out of there  who  that's the boy  intern who's 
[04:19:00]  cutting the cake  with his shaky hands  oh god  don't touch it  you're doing great  you're doing great  Sydney's just  condescendingly  telling him  he's doing a great job  I'm really excited  about this cake  I just want it  Sydney some thoughts  on your internship  some thoughts  maybe some highlights  highlights  or any kind of thoughts  the fact that there  even were highlights  to her internship  which shows you  how unfair  this whole thing is  don't touch it  I think I got a great  picture right there  yeah you rock just  literally shoot  intern douchebag  out of the studio 
[04:19:30]  intern douchebag  wait are you guys  sad that you guys  are separating  Sydney and Jackie  are you sad  what a team you've made  you guys became  friends right  I'm coming to Florida  soon  I'm going to drive  to Florida  so I'll go see her  you guys are now  friends right  the people that work  here don't even  like each other  how can these two  like each other  because we're awesome  because we have a  very good work  environment  yes  yes  thank you  you know what  the sweetness of the  cake represents  Sydney's tenure here 
[04:20:00]  at the Opie and  Anthony show  but it's covering up  the bitter part of  you having to leave  us  very sad  very sad  it's very sweet  it's a sweet moment  she's supposed to  leave  none of you guys  notice her today  and then forget she  ever existed  by Monday  that's how this works  why don't you join  the haters on Twitter  not anymore  why don't you go  fucking join those  can we bounce you  no no

[04:21:00]  with any of the  Breaking Bad guys  no  I haven't taken a picture  in a week or so  because I didn't feel  like I was camera ready  but for you  I'm camera ready  thank you  it means that you knew  yesterday  or this morning  I actually got the haircut  knowing this day was coming  oh wow  why would you know  what her last day was  that's so cute  that's so cute  because I checked the calendar  around here Sam  it's been circled for months  since her last day was  she didn't even know  what her last day was  no 
[04:21:30]  me and Anthony do  we knew the whole time  yeah  we just knew in our hearts  yes  in our hearts  we felt the longing  knowing it was coming  we knew  oh Sydney  I only wish  the best for you  I hope this was a good one  I don't even think this show has this kind of budget  to bring cakes for the interns  of course it does  it's time we step up  we step up  and let the interns know  job well done  that's what I say  the cake is delicious  the cake is freaking delicious  it is unbelievably good cake  it's wonderful  you're welcome

[04:22:30]  it was very fun  interning with you guys  oh  we're a delight  you know what  you are  this is so telling  what she just said  it's been known for a long time  that we're just a delight  she looked at Opie and Anthony  yeah  and she said  it's been very nice  interning with you guys  yeah  of course  every other intern  what  would shake  and say for  you guys  uh huh  because they've been conditioned  that you can't even make eye contact  with the talent 
[04:23:00]  but we never said that  she's over there going  with my peers  Opie and Anthony  well  sure  do you know what it's like  to walk through that door  every morning  yes  walk past  the campgrounds  and just look in  and say  and say  good morning  and get a little  good morning  hi  hello  it sets the tone  yes  for my entire day  I have a really big accomplishment  you don't even say  good morning to us  what  yeah  you know what happened  when you walked by  my office this morning  what  you did this  uh 
[04:23:30]  I did do that  I got a nice smile and wave  good morning  maybe Ann had a burp  he was just getting rid of a burp  I think good mornings from Kenny  you do  and thank yous  of course  and you should  and you should  I love it  I think you had something else  you were going to say  that I  because he doesn't even talk to Tyler  he doesn't acknowledge Tyler  who does  I don't know who this Tyler guy is  but I get good mornings and thank yous  and I love it  aww  you mean intern douchebag  no I mean Tyler  Denny  grab a mic  Denny's here  don't grab one of the girls mics 
[04:24:00]  no no  grab Sam's  that's fine  that's just fine  whatever you learned here  forget  oh wow  Denny  no these guys  these guys are the best  and I uh  of course  Denny uh  she's going in the radio  for real  she's got her  her own show  not technically  she's got her own show  that's how it begins  with a part time position  I heard  we lose interns  every semester  what  this is not an event  it's time though  it's long overdue  aww 
[04:24:30]  it's long overdue  that we  we should have  acknowledged the interns earlier  right  and now we're just starting  um  a trend here  that's right  isn't it going to happen  from now on  yes  it might  Denny  you shouldn't talk  with cake in your mouth  and you're a microphone  Sam  you're right  Denny  just make sure you  uh you know  give it your all  give 110% every day  I usually give about 50  no  that's good enough  there's two of you  it's 50-50  that's 100%  give 110%  unless you're wearing  a sundress 
[04:25:00]  and then 30 is fine  30 is a good day's work  yeah that's the new math  you know that right  yeah that's the new math  Denny  give her advice  she's working for  a modern music station  that's very good  playing contemporary  hit music I guess  right  CHR  is it CHR  it's modern music  do you know what  CHR means  contemporary hit music  contemporary hit music  did you know that  before he said that  no  that's okay  unless it's  you'll learn on the job  you'll learn  those are those things  they teach you at radio school  that don't even matter 
[04:25:30]  right  CHR  yeah it's not  contemporary hit music  and everybody goes  yep  you're right  I didn't even notice  I didn't either  I'm just like  that's adorable  before she even said  anything it was  correct  correct  correctamundo  what's the slug line  for the station  it's like brand new  yeah it's fine  it used to be  you'll learn that  the first day 
[04:26:00]  it used to be the rock station  I worked at  because I had the same thing  before I left  it'll be written down  somewhere for you  it's fine  you keep it on a 3x5  index card in front of you  make sure you open and close  the microphone  with the call letters  the positioning statement  and just always move forward  move forward  and stay abreast  of everything going on  in pop culture  like Sam does  I mean this guy  he just knows everything  about pop culture  a lot of good  it's dummy too  too bad he's such an  too bad he's such an asshole  too bad his voice

[04:29:00]  let's hit the post  yeah it's what's  held this show  back for years  shut up  here's the post  hi girls  hi Jackie  hi Jackie's mom  we were looking  how you uh  you both like  walk down the hall  the same way  you laugh the same way  you certainly are  identical  this is creepy  yeah  we can make a lot  of money from you two  she what  I'm sorry  Mike  what happened 
[04:29:30]  what  you said  and she had  more experience  she didn't  oh well  you know  there's other  alternative words  to that  that I really  didn't want to say  but uh  you know  yeah we're nice  people here  yeah we  we have to be  uh  nice  oh you know  I would  you know  I  I would  oh my god  this is exactly  I just want to say  I would  Jackie was petrified  yesterday  I'm just saying  I would  that's a compliment  that is a compliment  I would  yeah  you know  if things were 
[04:30:00]  different  I would  if what was  different  they're just  things  Jackie was saying  yesterday  that um  she  if her mom  was single  she'd be  pretty worried  about bringing  her here  but you've been  married 28 years  yeah 29 in August  29 in August  you got married  young obviously  20 right out  of college  wow  are you gonna  do that  Jackie  you think  get married  right out  of  look at her mom 
[04:30:30]  begging  it depends how  this goes  no look at  look at her mom  shaking her head  no  don't like  the boyfriend  basically she's  saying  I made a huge  mistake  don't do what  I did  oh my god  I love you  at all  but don't  follow my path  you see her  shaking her head  exactly  you guys know  horrible questions  you subjected  my mother to  no  any thought  of that  I'm remembering  that no  no  I admit it 
[04:31:00]  I would  that's a little  that's a little  edgy  no  no  not even close  not even close  oh it was  pretty yeah  Jackie's gotten  some very  she's been treated  very well here  on her internship  like every intern  that's come before  her  no just  just turn  Sydney  Sam  Sam was an intern  when he started  with us  years and years  ago  many many years  and he's resentful  that we finally  decided  perhaps it's time  we treat the interns 
[04:31:30]  a little better  than we have been  I don't understand  why he's so angry  with that  there's a third  member of the  intern class  that is still  treated like the  old regime  speaking of which  he happens to be a boy  but speaking of which  have him come in  have him come in  have him come in  so he could share  in this joy  actually he's coming  in with Jackie's  cake  that's Jackie's  I think he's  interning too  we're not really  sure  isn't this terrible  that twice 
[04:32:00]  he's had to bring  balloons and cake  in for other interns  that are leaving  and knowing  he will not get  the same  when he leaves  it's going to be  bon voyage  sunny boy  whatever your name  is  whatever your name  is  is this a good  cake  what does it say  yeah  what does the  cake say  I told them  I told them  to write something  very nice  Sam told me  yesterday  he asked if he  could do a little  funny  mean joke  that goes against 
[04:32:30]  what I wanted  how dare you  now you  I mean  Roland said  okay what should  we make the cake  say  so I said  I'll tell you  exactly what  the cake  should say  and what does  it say  Jackie  this is  completely  ridiculous  oh no  it is ridiculous  that you're leaving  that's right  very good  Sam  Sam  it's the perfect  cake  Sam  why would we  want to get rid  of someone  that is so good  that's ridiculous  that's not what I meant  that's 
[04:33:00]  it's absolutely  what he meant  I think so  good choice of words  Sam  and we loved  both our interns  this summer  three  but we might  like Jackie  a little bit more  and with that  we got Ryan Starr  outside the studio  oh yes  oh you get a little  more than Sydney  what's up  that's Jackie  and Jackie's mom  and Jackie's mom  Jackie's our intern  and she's leaving  we're devastated  could you like  serenade Jackie  in our last day  because you know 
[04:33:30]  Sydney got to send off  with just a song  we decided  Jackie really  went over the top  why not get  Ryan Starr  to serenade you  on your last day here  if you will  Ryan do you have  a sweet song  maybe  a sweet song  for Jackie  and Jackie's mom  who's very  very doable  Jackie  I mean  who's a very nice lady  the best intern ever  I gotta say  it's always interesting  on the road  because  it's fitting your mom  is here  because I've been 
[04:34:00]  at shows  where moms  are holding  signs of  like I don't know  I don't know  why moms are there  but they say  my daughter  just turned 18  it's really  it's wacky  it is like an offering  yes  you never know  and then  and then it's funny  because I'm  I'm getting  you know  I'm in my 30s now  so it's not like  I'm 18  so it's weird  so like  I can't tell  who I'm supposed  to be attracted to  the 40 year old mom  or like  oh man  see  my friends say 
[04:34:30]  both  yeah  both  Jackie  you shouldn't  talk like that  very good  no no  it's a good thing  your mom's here  this is for Jackie  this is for Jackie  should I hit a chorus  should we just  should we just  get right to the point  or something  yeah yeah  this is a  um  clocks marching  at the double time  every dollar  has become a dime  hearts breaking  at the speed of sound 
[04:35:00]  you're falling down  all around  oh oh  bombs lighting  up the eastern sky  the back room  deals in the bottom line  the earth's shaking  but we don't know why  a million fires  oceans rise  oh oh  I leave it all  when I feel you near  what I'm saying  is I need you here  even though love  never seems to last  if you think  we got a chance  stay a while  oh you got to 
[04:35:30]  stay a while  oh oh  these days are wild  Jackie  won't you stay  a while  oh oh  I drop the needle  on the bell brigade  we'll slow dance  till the moonlight  fades  we'll tell me now  that you never leave  you'll always stay  here with me  oh oh  I'll keep you safe 
[04:36:00]  from the circus show  the bullshitted  and the blowing smoke  the knife hidden  under every sleeve  they'll stab you back  they'll watch you bleed  oh oh  they're gonna tell you  what you wanna hear  like  I could make you  a star next year  well  if New York City's  lights are so bright  how come so many  people crying  tonight  stay a while  oh  you got to  stay a while  oh oh 
[04:36:30]  these days are wild  Jackie  won't you stay  a while  let your hair fall  around your face  I would kill  just to keep you safe  put your body  next to mine 
[04:37:00]  sorry mom  just let go  and close your eyes  I shiver  when I feel  your skin  like a sinner  who's been forgiven  go on baby  shine your light  cause no one's  gonna find us  here tonight  stay a while  oh  you got to  stay a while  oh  these days are wild  Jackie  won't you stay 
[04:37:30]  a while  I love  I love  I love  oh  wow  wow  for Jackie  for Jackie  where are you going  she's just going  my cheeks are shaking  that's amazing  she's just going back to  Rancho  that reminds me of another  intern send off  from  I don't  I don't remember  um  remember when we  no  there was that  intern  yeah we've been 
[04:38:00]  serenading the interns  for many many years now  there's a rock star  singing a ballad  to an intern  begging her to  stay  oh my god  I know  she said it  she said it  actually I'm looking  for an intern  oh  really  must have  passport  I have a passport  wow  it sounds like  an abduction  and no record  no criminal record  no criminal record  oh  that might be a problem  no  there's none 
[04:38:30]  too bad  Ryan Starr looks like  a serial killer right now  or that's what's up next  sounds like a great  proposition  nothing  I go back to school  and that's  that's about it  school  yeah I can put that off  see  school  I don't really need school  I'm teeing her up  I'm teeing her up  for a job  alright  oh man  how did this go for you  did you learn a lot  did they teach you  all their wisdom  I did  they taught me  all their wisdom  I learned a lot  what  Sam learned a lot  you're really  holding a grudge 
[04:39:00]  from your internship  it was a different  experience  Sam has the feeling  that perhaps  we didn't treat him  as nicely  when he was an intern  or any other intern  as we treat Jackie  it's not just me  I speak for every intern  that ever interned you  what are you talking about  except for Jackie  what are you the  Martin Luther King of interns  come on  speak for everybody  we've always been  judged the interns  on the content  of the character  not the beauty  I mean  the color of their skin  he had a dream  paid lunches  well Jackie 
[04:39:30]  you know  sounds like you should  stick around  what more can we  what more can we say  good thing I have to  pack up the car today  oh man  do you need help  what  my last day  of my internship  I went to Hooters  with Travis  one of the worst meals  of my life  sounds like a party  I've seen all the  different clothes she wears  and the boxes  are going to be heavy  and of course  Jackie's mom's not  going to be able to  handle the big heavy boxes  so I figure maybe 
[04:40:00]  I should lend a hand  I guess you're feeling  helpful  of course  that's what a gentleman  does  yeah I know  but we're not talking  about a gentleman  who's replacing Jackie  oh god  no one replaces Jackie  there is no one  I mean  there'll be someone  in her place  but no one  will replace Jackie  can we possibly  grab a ray of sunshine  and bring it in the  building  I think not  so replace  no  no  would be hilarious  though  if we got two more 
[04:40:30]  cute girls next semester  and they would be  like who  what  what is this  remember Sydney  who is he  oh we've cut the cake  we've serenaded Jackie  and her mom  it's much later  than we would have  stayed in any other  circumstance  on a Friday  before vacation  and the voice  the glasses  I'm just  I'm happy to be here  nobody else  I'd probably pull myself 
[04:41:00]  out of bed  that's not  see  look at that Jackie  he's not talking about us  he's talking about you  that's Jackie  oh no Jackie  I'm glad  it was beautiful  he was talking about her  amazing  I am  Jackie's mom  does that get you  going a little bit  and you guys  a little bit right  a little bit  seeing your daughter  being serenaded  by a rock star  alright  do we have another song  for Jackie  yes we do  oh we do  what  which one  we're going with  she just got serenaded  alright  what's the song 
[04:41:30]  for Jackie  we'll just play it  as we end the show  oh okay  this is  E-Rock picked this  it's not the one  from yesterday right  no it's  you and I talked  about it early  in the week  see  what  are you  what  earlier in the week  like this  I like  I like prepping  for my radio show  you've never prepped  for your radio show  you had to call  your old boss  from 15 years ago  today  that's it  Jackie's mom  thank you  thank you  thank you  oh of course 
[04:42:00]  yes  I'll bet you  you know  it's  it's just our job  to do that  with every intern  and uh  you know  oh  we don't just  oh  Jackie's getting  a little background  what about mom  little mom  what about mom  you gotta make up mom  we got some delicious cake  alright  we're going to play this  for Jackie  and uh  very cool  baby you're a pie  the worst is yet to come  this is ONA's worst of 2013

[04:48:30]  here's the thing  management doesn't  want us talking  about on the air yet  well maybe they  should have let us  onto it  you guys talked  about it all  last week  while we were gone  I'll say there was  a buzz about  the office  but rumors run  rampant here  in Sirius X  who knows what  fact is  he's moving  into finance  he is  that's how I'm  here  we heard  wow  it's gonna  it's gonna hurt  but I just  want to thank  Gary for  for what  you can't do it  now 
[04:49:00]  it doesn't make  you a good  person to do  it now  I want to  thank Gary  for doing  you know  his best  the best he could  for the Opie  Anthony channel  what does that  mean  I just want to  thank you  what is that  well we live  in a world  where everyone  gets a trophy  so Gary  we're gonna  get you a trophy  for your effort  we're gonna get  you a trophy  and we're gonna  put a wig on it  just want to  thank Gary  aka the radio  wizard for  the effort  he put into 
[04:49:30]  this channel  not for the  action  for the effort  the effort  for meaning  well  what about  the results  for meaning  well  for meaning  so well  so he gets  a prize  for good  intentions  yeah  yes  a trophy  for good  intentions  okay  what about  what about  the  what he  accomplished  I want to  thank Gary  for giving  it his all  you're keeping  it positive  oh  keeping it  positive  he really  gave it  his all  I have 
[04:50:00]  no doubt  about that  well at  the end  of the  day  and this  is true  whether he'll  be here  or not  he gets  credit for  that bus  trip that's  going down  next week  he did  oh yeah  he did  the most  with the  skill set  he had  what do you  mean  we could  you added  in skill set  which is  like  see we 
[04:50:30]  should have  done that  bit  I was  thinking  this would  be a great  production piece  with some  Gary highlights  in it  well if  it's official  I said  if it's  official  then we'll  do it  proper  tomorrow  okay  can we  get a  trophy  made  I don't  see why  not  by tomorrow  oh boy  bowling pin  I can  I can  get a  glasses on  it  well finance  is going  to get 
[04:51:00]  a hell of a  person  fine  an asset  an asset  well  all  all these  all these  half  truths  yes  you know  the announcement  hasn't been  made  nobody's told  you anything  yet  well if you  guys are  talking about  then it has  to be true  I trust you  guys  Kenny  Kenny you want  to share some  of your feelings  what's this  about  I don't know  maybe the  meeting is 
[04:51:30]  they're going  to tell you  who your new  boss is  do we have  a new  boss  I don't  know  there's some  talk in the  hallways  what's the  talk in the  hallways  that you  have a new  boss  I mean all  I've heard  is Gary  what's the  new  boss  meet the  new boss  same as  the old  boss  it's 10  o'clock  why are you  scared to  say it  he'll come  in and  contribute the  beginning of  it but he's 
[04:52:00]  afraid to give  the results  I want to  thank the  radio wizard  for being  there for  us  oh okay  this is  moving in  the right  direction  it's there  yeah  I thought  that was  going to be  the beginning  of  doing the  best he  could  you want  to add  to the  sand  just  you know  godspeed  have fun  over there  in finance  it's not  official  where  I think  the real 
[04:52:30]  excitement  happens  if this  is true  days are  going to  get a lot  easier  yeah  that's  true  well that's  true  you could  wake up  every morning  knowing  that I'm  going to  work in  finance  over at  Sirius XM  satellite radio  if this is  true  you know  what will  happen  we'll see  Gary in six  months with a  full head of  hair  well it has  been known  to happen  I grow  back  I just  grow back 
[04:53:00]  I didn't  have any  people do  gain some  years on  their lives  after they  are done  working with  us  watch those  crows feet  drift away  oh yeah  hair starts  sprouting  where there  was none  before  here's Gary  now  he's coming  down the hall  oh he is  well  open the door  I gotta ask  Roland please  just open the  door  Penny would you  open the door  is he coming  in  Gary  hey  are you 
[04:53:30]  leaving us  not that I'm  aware of  is this considered  a lateral move  are you allowed  to  are you moving  to finance  we heard  you're going  to finance  where does  this come  from  not going  to finance  oh  you're not  fired are  you  no  okay  oh  not fired  not financed  where you  going  he's going  to tell us  in two minutes  who gives a  fuck  I'm looking 
[04:54:00]  forward to  hearing what  it is  you don't  know  I don't  know at  all  that's for  sure  I've got  to tell  us  will you  be working  with the  show  no one  has told  me one  way or  another  look  come on  down  look how  happy he  looks  you look  you look  very happy  he's not  leaving here  with one  last headache  that's  for sure  you're trying 
[04:54:30]  to make  sure he  gets a  boot on  the way  out  no way  Gary is  too smart  for that  he's gonna  get to get  you get to  throw away  your  your  your  excedrin  yes  well  the answer  is  right down  the hall  he seems  very eager  to get an  answer  even to  the end  he's a  pussy  I knew  he couldn't  keep it  nice  but like  what  what does  it matter  if he  tells us 
[04:55:00]  here or  if we  find out  in two  minutes  there  he knows  you think  he knows  for sure  of course  he does  will you  come back  and tell  the after  show  what happens  I'm gonna  give you  an exclusive  today  Sam Roberts  yeah  yes  ok good  OP radio  on twitter  is gonna  give you  an exclusive  I guess  I'll just  be reading  along  then  oh yeah  I gotta  piss  this is  you in  on this  Jimmy  come on  I think 
[04:55:30]  so yeah  Gary  didn't  leave me  the message  I had  a doctor's  appointment  but it's  not till  11  how great  would it  be  if you  guys  are finally  walking  to a  meeting  with  confidence  and it's  like  no no no  Gary's  not leaving  you are  you are  it's like  wait a minute  we didn't  see that  coming  I fucking  got a  sailboat  ready to  go  you're good  can we  collect  the radio  wizard's  tears  and maybe  they could  come up  with a new  flavor  up there  why would  he cry  you mean  because he  doesn't want  to leave  the show 
[04:56:00]  he doesn't  have much  of a choice  in the matter  I don't  think  he's out  he's done  right  you're out  Tom  he is  done  today  well  we're still  in the  transitional  period  how long  does the  transitional  period  last  till the  transition  but how  long is  that  I don't  know  next week  I'm gonna  guess  yeah  yes within  the week  next week  I would  say it'll  be done  once again  we're saying  goodbye to  management  seems to 
[04:56:30]  happen a lot  once again  no more  dealing with  Gary  or  Steve I guess  right  Steve Blatter  I guess  or Rob Cross  or Rob Cross  that's right  I barely see  Rob Cross  he interacts  more  he's usually  in a pretty  good mood  so we got 
[04:57:00]  a couple  things we  want to  play for  Gary  even though  everyone's  leaving  where's the  Steve Blatter  goodbye song  or the Rob  Cross medley  Troy and I  worked on  what was  requested  we're basically  short order  cooks here  exclusively  Radio Wizard  you guys said  you wanted to  say goodbye  to Gary  and wanted a  celebration for him  so we have a  gift for him  we do have a 
[04:57:30]  gift  and a couple  of  yeah it's right  there in the  middle of the  table  we did get a  participation trophy  yes  for Gary  I hope he's  appreciative  you think he  will be  I hope he  will come down  and join us  for a celebration  I don't see  anyone  I don't see  it happening  I don't see a  silhouette of a  light bulb  walking down the  hall  and he's going  to finance  that was the  rumor but I was  told he's not  going to finance  he's going to  finance 
[04:58:00]  it's pretty obvious  did you ask him  if he's going to  finance  I did not  personally  but I'm asking  him right now  I'm sure he's  listening Gary  please  I don't know  if he listens  anymore  I guess he  doesn't have  to  why would he  why would he  be listening to  us and beat him  up if he has  nothing to do  with us  nobody in finance  listens to us  no  for old time's  sake can we  just beat him  up every once  in a while  I don't think  we could stop  you if we  wanted to  it's not  going to feel  the same  though  it won't  no  and the breaking  news was that  Tim Sabian is  going to be  running the  channel
