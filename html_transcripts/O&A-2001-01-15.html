<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed account of the departure of Stinky, Black Earl, Dan from Hoboken, and their driver Scott on a road trip to Winona, Mississippi, ostensibly a Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration. Earl's pre-trip anxieties, fueled by needing a house sitter and his all-black outfit, provided early comedic fodder.  A pre-departure interview with Susie from WONA radio in Winona showcased her excitement, contrasted by a caller’s geographically challenged contribution.  The hosts discussed the crew’s filming equipment and anticipated fan following.  A live segment outside the Brooklyn Diner featured the send-off, with excited listener calls predicting fights and mishaps, even a potential police chase.  The crew departed in a large black Suburban, leaving listeners in eager anticipation.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the New York Giants’ Super Bowl prospects, interspersed with listener calls.

The show continued with updates on the Mississippi road trip, encouraging listener sightings of the "wow"-sign-adorned Suburban.  This transitioned into a poorly-executed parody song, "Who Let the Vikes Out," followed by calls including one detailing a Knicks game fight between Marcus Camby and Jeff Van Gundy.  The conversation then veered into the Giants’ Super Bowl chances and a comparison of Reagan and Clinton’s responses to tragedy.  A significant portion focused on a sexually suggestive phone conversation with "Stalker Patty," featuring simulated orgasms, joined by "Donna" with her own simulated moans.  Discussions about the cost of divorce, featuring a call with lawyer Joel, and more parody songs from guest "Q" (including one about Stinky and Earl's trip) filled the airwaves.  The segment concluded with in-studio guests Lady Di and Marion, who presented gifts and participated in brief conversation.

The next segment prominently featured Lady Di and Marion, beginning with discussions about a disliked cologne gift and crude comments about Diane’s appearance.  A poorly-executed Laverne and Shirley theme song attempt, punctuated by laughter and crude remarks, followed.  A significant portion revolved around a game guessing Marion’s recent surgery (revealed to be the removal of two ovarian cysts), involving graphic descriptions and guesses.  The conversation continued with sexually suggestive banter about Diane's leather pants and lingerie, including requests to see her underwear, along with jokes about an abandoned double date.  The recurring "retarded Laverne and Shirley" nickname was liberally applied. A listener falsely claiming Marion’s pregnancy led to further joking.  The hosts discussed Stinky and Earl’s road trip, playing a song with crude lyrics about their journey, and checked in with them multiple times.  Listener calls frequently contained insults toward the female guests.  The segment ended with plans for a "retarded Laverne and Shirley show" for Lady Di and Marion, mention of a planned call with Ronald Reagan, and numerous weight loss product advertisements.

A 15-minute tryout of "The Retarded Laverne and Shirley Show" followed, introduced with crude humor and the descriptor "retarded" by Opie and Anthony.  The show itself covered sports, celebrity news (Derek Jeter), Ronald Reagan’s hip surgery, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  The segment was punctuated by offensive and sexually suggestive calls, with callers using derogatory language and making crude sexual remarks.  The hosts responded in kind. One caller described a graphic detail about their wife's death following ovarian cyst removal; another asked about a host's thong. A caller pretended to be Monsignor O'Reilly, praying for their deaths.  Brief discussion of past drug use and sexual experiences occurred.  A Connecticut School of Broadcasting caller offered scholarships.  Opie and Anthony returned, discussing the tryout and transitioning to updates on Stinky and Earl’s increasingly problematic road trip, including a song about their journey.

The final segment began with unsuccessful attempts to contact Ronald Reagan, transitioning to a comedic bit with a caller impersonating him, delivering a rambling, age-related, and vulgar monologue about his hip injury, Nancy Reagan, and his alleged faked Alzheimer’s.  Lady Di and Marion returned, with conversation shifting to their appearances, weight loss, bras, and the hosts' sexually suggestive commentary.  Weight-loss product promotion, interspersed with flirtatious interactions, followed.  Updates from Stinky and Earl’s road trip, frequently interrupted by poor service, detailed near-accidents, Earl’s potentially hidden items, and tense interactions with locals.  The broadcast concluded with a song by Opie’s brother recounting a humorous and potentially dangerous encounter with locals during the road trip.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  Stay out of the bushes!  You're a kid, Georgia!  1027 WNEW, it's the ONA Show.  Hey.  Howdy.  And it looks like the boys are just about ready to start their road trip. 
[00:00:30]  That's why we're on the air early today, Anthony.  Yes.  So early.  My God, I'm yawning.  Oh, it's like 3 in the morning.  Ron and Fez were on right now.  Well, I think everyone that's a faithful listener of our show understands what's going on today, right?  Yes.  We are sending Stinky and Black Earl.  Yeah.  And Dan from Hoboken.  And Scott, right?  Scott the driver.  Who walked into our office with a Bud Light. 
[00:01:00]  He's got two cases of beer.  He walked in, actually, with two cases of Bud Light.  That's right, for the road trip.  Yeah.  They have packed the truck, and it looks like they're ready to rock and roll, Anthony.  Yeah, they're all ready to go, man.  This is happening.  They're going down to Winona, Mississippi.  It's a little commemoration, also, for Dr. Martin Luther King.  Now, Earl going down there, a pilgrimage down to the south, where Dr. King did a lot of good work. 
[00:01:30]  Down there, Earl.  That's also where he died.  Well, where did he die?  Alabama?  Georgia?  Memphis, Tennessee.  You'll be going through Tennessee, right?  Yep.  You should stop off at Memphis.  Maybe Earl could wave from that hotel balcony.  What?  I'll leave it on my bell.  We should start with Earl.  I heard you were a little nervous over the weekend.  We got a phone call from Earl, didn't we?  Did anyone take the phone call?  Now, that would have been classic.  I heard you were starting to get second thoughts about this, Earl. 
[00:02:00]  I just wanted to know how long we were going to be gone.  Stay out the bushes!  You'll be back by Friday at the latest.  Possibly Thursday afternoon, right?  God willing.  I think we're shooting for Thursday afternoon.  Don't say shooting, Earl, while you're going down there.  Say you're going for it.  Are you nervous, Earl?  No, not at all.  You sure?  Yeah.  Ben, get Ben on the...  You talked to Ben over the weekend, didn't you?  Yeah, Earl.  Let's be a little truthful, Earl. 
[00:02:30]  Let's be a little truthful.  You are snoted out of your mind.  Yeah, I've been skiing all day.  But he goes, I want to get a house sitter.  I need a house sitter.  I'm leaving my house.  You live in an apartment the size of the studio.  You don't need a house sitter.  You're supposed to have work done in the apartment.  Sure.  When you're done, you live in a box like we all do.  Get your CDs organized.  What kind of work?  What are they going to do to you?  Clean his black clothes.  The ceiling's crumbling.  The ceiling is crumbling.  Yeah.  A second of the...  Section's coming down.  A little water damage.  Yes.  Yeah, there you go.  So you figured I better, you know, not go because I have to make sure this is done? 
[00:03:00]  No, I put in for the work already and it just completely flipped my mind.  Ah, that's okay.  It's not going to crumble anymore.  You'll get it fixed.  I'm a little worried about Earl's attire.  Now, Earl.  Earl always wears black.  So he's in black.  But then he's got the big black peacoat on and his hat and his sunglasses.  I'm thinking, I know you like wearing black, but I'm thinking maybe some denim coveralls  and something flannel underneath so you look like maybe you're working down there or something. 
[00:03:30]  Right now you look like someone from New York that'll be a little uppity.  He needs to warm up his wardrobe, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's a little too scary and dark.  That's scary for down there, I think.  You're going to be scaring people.  Oh, I won't.  I'm going to be a good boy down there.  No pun intended.  Ah.  Ah.  If I didn't know you and I saw you dress like that, I'd be scared.  I'd be scared.  S-less.  Maybe it's my own racial profiling going on in my head, but I would be a little frightened.  That's if I'm driving.  That's the way you look.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Don't let Earl drive.  Oh, believe us.  He's in the back.  Yeah.  You'll end up in God knows where.  We'll get there Thursday afternoon.  Do you have a contingency plan if you get pulled over?  What are you going to say Earl is doing with you?  They're transporting a...  Transporting a prisoner.  Oh, my God.  Stinky, you ready?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I guess he is ready.  He said, oh, yeah, I'm effing ready.  You're excited to go, huh? 
[00:04:30]  Hell, yeah.  Yeah.  Because I know you're not excited because the Giants won yesterday because I see that nice  Jets cap on your head there.  So, you must be excited about the road trip.  Yeah.  Get away from New York.  That's the best thing.  There you go.  A lot of people want to know, Stinky, do you have your fish cassettes packed?  Oh, I got multiple CDs, many songs.  A lot of fish?  A lot of long jamming songs.  Oh, brother.  Talk about veering off the road to sleep.  Fish.  How many times are you going to be hearing, when you hit those things on the side of the 
[00:05:00]  road?  Oh, you need some of those long jams to get you through.  Yeah, you know?  There you go.  You can't have, like, five-minute pop songs constantly.  Earl, did you bring any music for the road trip?  For Metallica.  The Black Rock Coalition.  From Metallica.  I brought some...  There's only so much Living Color you can play.  I brought some Bad Brains.  I brought some...  One for Dan.  Bad Brains, huh?  I brought some Bad Brains.  I brought a nice mix of music.  Right on, man.  To keep us awake.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:05:30]  And, Stinky, the truck is loaded and ready to go?  Oh, yeah.  It's a huge truck.  It's like one of those big black trucks that the federal agents drive.  Like the Secret Service drives it and stuff.  Yeah, and then you can add the shield in the front and everything.  Wow.  Nice.  And it's all the windows blacked out?  Yep.  Nice.  It has a magnet wow stuck on each side, a big wow letter.  Oh, good.  Let's just tell everybody where we're going to be.  Yeah, but Scott, who's driving the fine Suburban, right?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I was reading an email before the show.  There's a bunch of people that are planning on following you for a while. 
[00:06:00]  If they can.  You know how when one of those big boats leave the harbor and a lot of little sailboats try to keep up for a while?  And they finally have to back off?  Yeah.  We'll see how long some of these people drive with you guys until they say, you know what?  I've had it.  I've got a life.  I've got a life.  I've got to turn around.  I think I need a ride back.  Right.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting to see if someone goes all the way with you again.  You never know.  I think.  Dan from Hoboken, you ready?  I'm ready.  Yeah.  I'm a little scared.  Are you?  I'm ready. 
[00:06:30]  He's our rider for this trip.  A lot of people are a little leery about this.  I was just hanging out with their own stinky, and I think it would be better to have Ron Goldman Sr. and O.J. in a room together.  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  These two did not get along very well.  We were saying they're bringing a recorder with them.  Yeah, we told Dan it's his job, and we're like, Dan, you've got to understand this perfectly clear.  These guys love to fight and yell at each other, and when they start fighting in the middle of nowhere, you've got to turn on that debt recorder.  And wait a minute.  They have a camcorder.  And a camcorder.  So we want the video of you two brawling, because they just don't get along. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And we've got a digital camera.  Supposedly Earl's going to uplink some pics.  Upload some pictures.  Upload some pics.  What do you want on this webpage?  I don't know.  And, Scott, are you psyched, the driver?  We haven't talked to you much yet.  Yeah, it's all right.  I just want to say that this is a perfect opportunity for me to star on that police record I so richly deserve.  There you go.  What a great first thing to have on your record.  Very good.  Thank you very much.  All right, we've got Susie from W-O-N-A in Mississippi. 
[00:07:30]  Wynonna, Mississippi, on the line.  Susie!  Hello, guys.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm great.  We've got our boys.  Their truck is packed, and they're ready to start their road trip to Mississippi.  Yeah, I gather that.  So we're for real now.  Yes, you are.  You should take down one of their cell phone numbers so you can call them to see how far they have made.  Okay, well, I guess you can give it to me in mere moments, right?  Yeah, we'll do that when we put you back on hold.  Okay, Opie, we're getting a lot of instant feedback. 
[00:08:00]  A lot of people very excited about this trip.  Tom from Teaneck, the first true moron on the instant feedback today who should take a geography lesson.  Hey, guys, they ain't going to make it through Ohio.  Ohio, tinted windows are banned in Ohio, so they're F'd.  Ohio?  Wait a minute.  They're not going anywhere near Ohio.  Ohio?  Ohio?  New York to Mississippi.  I don't think we're going through Ohio, Tom. 
[00:08:30]  I don't see it.  You better refer to a map.  Man.  If Earl was driving, that's definitely a possibility.  I know a shortcut.  Ohio.  So, Susie, are you guys psyched down there in Winona?  Yes.  All right.  I'm ready.  You're going to show them a good time tomorrow night?  Yes, I am.  Been thinking a little more about this?  Yeah, I have.  And, okay, anything new that you could add as to what they'll be doing?  Well, I'll just save it for a surprise.  Oh, right.  Oh, that means you have nothing planned.  No.  No, I'm way ahead of you guys.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, how far is Biloxi, Mississippi?  It made the paper today, somebody was shot in the casino.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Wow.  It was a bad situation.  What happened there?  A guy playing the $5 slot machines decided that he had had a bad evening and took out two  women and then shot himself.  Shot people because he lost?  Yep.  God, I hate that.  And that's relatively close to where you're at, right?  Biloxi, no, that's down in the coast.  Oh, okay.  I'm in central Mississippi, right smack dab in the middle. 
[00:09:30]  Where they don't need a reason to shoot people.  Exactly.  At least this guy had somewhat of a reason.  Hey, Susie, any requests?  We're putting together a little care package for you.  Actually, there is, but I don't know if it would travel well because it's a food item.  Yeah.  I would love, just absolutely love a real Italian calzone.  Oh, man.  We could wrap some of that up.  Now it is like Smokey and the Band-Aid.  Now there's time constraints because of the temperature. 
[00:10:00]  We could wrap up some calzone, can't we?  Oh, God, I love them.  Yeah, we could send.  Yeah.  Pick up a calzone.  Yeah, pick up a calzone on your way out of Manhattan, all right?  Oh, thank you.  And we'll wrap it up nice for you.  Okay.  Now, that's not boating well for your image.  Why?  Because, you know, if you want a calzone, we're thinking maybe a little big in the caboose.  Uh, well, you'll just have to wait and see when you get here now, won't you?  Yes.  Stinky will be our eyes and ears.  Well, as a matter of fact, I finally got onto your site and I went to the stinky cam. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  There was nothing going on, though, right?  Well, actually, there was.  It was for a long time.  It was, you know, the cam is offline.  Yeah.  But it finally was online and it's one picture over and over.  Oh, yeah.  It must have been froze because when we have things going on in the studio, we turn it on  and people get to watch what's going on in the studio.  And then at the end of the show, we turn it off and the still picture is just kind of stuck up there.  Well, so far, I have managed to see Stinky's feet. 
[00:11:00]  I have not been able to find a photo of Earl.  No?  No.  Unless I'm looking in the wrong spot.  I think he's up on Foundry.  He's on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, there's a picture of Earl.  There's going to be more of them.  We're updating.  We just put up a new site, so there's going to be tons of pictures of Earl up there very soon.  Earl.  Actually, just close your eyes.  Oh, that's bad.  Oh, wow.  I don't have like that.  Now, listen.  Susie, that's the guy you have to worry about.  That's the driver, Scott, that just said that. 
[00:11:30]  Hi, hon.  Hi, Scott.  Do I have to really worry?  He's not gay.  Yes, you do.  He's saying yes.  Now, slow down just a minute now.  Slow down.  He brought two cases of Bud Light just for the ride.  No, no, no.  That's for you guys.  Oh, for us.  We've got about 12 cases in the truck.  That'll get you out of Jersey.  All right.  Cool.  You aren't worried about anything, are you?  To me?  Yeah.  Nah.  Oh, good.  No, of course not. 
[00:12:00]  I just don't want everything you've heard here to maybe give you a bad impression.  Well, actually.  These are fine folk coming down.  Well, I did.  I had a friend mail me a particular magazine.  Penthouse.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Penthouse, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, you saw our little feature that they did in Penthouse.  Yes, yes.  Anthony and I are international celebrities.  Yes.  So does this make me really famous now?  Yes, it does.  Yeah.  Actually, it does.  If you ever came to New York, you'd be a star. 
[00:12:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  If we did one of those road shows, people would come out just to see Susie from Mississippi.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  No.  Well, who is who now?  Who am I speaking with?  I don't know the voices, so I don't know who I'm speaking with.  Yeah, it's kind of rough when you first get us on the phone.  I'm Anthony, and I'm the one with the real sexy voice.  That old gag.  I'm glad to be able to put a picture with the voice now.  Yes, the Penthouse pictures.  You saw how friendly we were getting with the girl in the article.  Yeah, yeah, I saw that. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Susie, let me give you this incentive, okay?  If it goes very well with Stinky and Black Earl and Dan from Hoboken and Scott the Driver,  we will fly you up to New York for a lovely weekend.  You're kidding.  Yeah, we could do that.  And you can hang out with us and stuff.  Great.  All right, but you've got to treat these guys real nice down there.  Oh, I intend to.  All right.  Well, we're going to let you go for now because we want to get them on the road.  Okay, well, keep me long enough to give me a cell phone number, and I needed to tell  you guys a couple of things.  Okay.  Off the air.  All right, and are you going to be around this afternoon because we're going to be checking 
[00:13:30]  in with you from time to time?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on the line.  Rick will talk to you.  Okay.  There goes Susie.  I'll be people checking in all the time on the instant feedback.  Rob from Jersey City.  Hey, camcorders, backpacks, sounds like the Blair Witch Project.  Yeah.  All we're going to find is the camcorder and Stinky and Earl arguing, and then it'll just  go dead.  That could be funny.  And we'll take some bets on how many times they get pulled over.  All right.  I'm wondering.  So why don't we... 
[00:14:00]  I think at least two.  Thank you very much.  Why don't you guys hit the road, all right?  All right.  All right.  There they go.  Hey, Rick, why don't you go downstairs with the cell phone, and we'll see them off.  Bon voyage.  Anybody out...  Where are you guys going to be?  Out in front of the building?  No, actually, we're between 7th and 6th.  We can pull it from.  7th and 6th?  On 56th.  On 56th.  Between 7th.  Oh, okay.  On your Hooters.  Okay.  You're right by Hooters.  No, that's Broadway.  No, that's Broadway.  It's the other way.  Block East.  Oh, okay.  Park Meridian.  Yeah.  By the Park Meridian.  Well, how about this?  Someone go... 
[00:14:30]  I just want to know if anybody wants to stop by and wish them a bon voyage.  Why doesn't someone get the truck, and you guys wait outside the Brooklyn Diner, where  the faithful listeners know where they are.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Outside the Brooklyn Diner on 57th and 7th, that's where these guys are taking off from  if you're in the area.  Okay?  See you.  Guys, bon voyage.  Have a great trip.  Well, Anthony, we're going to talk to them.  We're going to take a quick break, and Rick will be down there with the cell phone to see  them off, okay?  Right.  So stay right there as the boys get ready for their road trip to Winona, Mississippi.  Wow. 
[00:15:00]  Opie and Anthony.  God damn genius.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Monday, January 15th.  We are live.  It's, what, 2.32, Anthony?  2.33.  Yeah.  The only radio show in New York, I think, that's live today.  Everyone else took off.  A lot of people took the MLK birth, uh, tribute day.  Is it his birthday?  What is this?  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  It's MLK Day.  It's MLK Day. 
[00:15:30]  And a lot of people, yeah, did take it off.  But we're too busy for that.  We have a road trip to get underway today.  Yes.  Down south.  We have Stinky and Black Earl and Dan from Hoboken and Scott, the driver, who reminds  me of Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  I like this guy.  He's got potential being out there.  He's got potential.  Uh, they're going to be outside, uh, the station in moments, uh, right in front of the Brooklyn  Diner to start their road trip.  We had a bunch of people that were outside the Brooklyn Diner.  They wanted to talk to us and our, our schmuck new intern hung up on them. 
[00:16:00]  Ouch.  So if you're outside the Brooklyn Diner, call back and we'll get you, get you on the radio.  And another guy that had something cool.  He said, uh, tell Stinky to bring back some, uh, hooch.  Oh, some hooch.  Well.  Had all these great calls and, uh, the new intern decided just to hang up on anyone.  Some, on, on everyone.  Thank you.  Southern moonshine.  Uh, let's.  Oh, that'll be nice.  Let's check in with Rick.  He's outside the building, outside the Brooklyn Diner on 57th and 7th. 
[00:16:30]  Rick, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I'm downstairs with, uh, our departing crew.  We're just waiting for, uh, Scott, the driver, the SUV driver, to, uh, pull around.  He's going to be pulling his truck out of the parking lot and pulling around here.  And, yeah, we do have, we have one listener down here.  All right.  Nice.  He's the only person that came to Manhattan today.  The streets are empty.  To wish him, uh, goodbye.  Wish them all goodbye.  Yeah.  So we got one listener here.  We got, uh, and the guys are actually warming up for the ride.  They're, they're playing with the football in the street.  Oh, good, good.  A little urban football.  Nice.  No, it's weird. 
[00:17:00]  I've never seen Stinky, uh, so excited in my life.  Yeah, he's very happy.  We've been doing this.  I guess he doesn't get to go away often or something.  I guess not.  So we're known in Mississippi.  Must be a huge treat for him.  Just wait a few hours in the vehicle with Earl.  He won't be happy anymore.  No.  When do you think it goes bad?  Because right now everyone's excited.  Like, wow, this is cool.  Going on a road trip.  I think, I think they won't even get out of Jersey before there's a problem.  Before it just starts getting ugly?  Yeah, before there's some kind of argument about, um, how fast someone's going or how 
[00:17:30]  slow someone's going.  Yeah.  Or how someone's sitting.  He's touching me.  I'm not touching you.  It's going to be all that kind.  Don't make me come back there.  Are we almost there yet?  Yeah.  Hey, Rick, is Stinky there?  I think he ran across the street for a second, but Earl's singing some, some, some, uh,  I don't know, some work songs or something.  Negro minstrels.  Yeah.  He's like, he's really happy.  I think he's the happiest I've ever seen Earl.  Ah, don't, don't let it fool you.  He's scared.  He's very frightened to be going down south. 
[00:18:00]  This is the first day in two and a half years here at WNW that I've seen Earl wear sunglasses  inside.  Yeah.  Because he's kind of like just keeping it within himself and stuff.  He's trying to look badass, I think.  He's trying to look all bad and that ain't going to wash down there.  He's, uh, trying to psych himself up.  Uh, Rick, hold on one sec, Kay.  Let's, uh, go to Jim who's downstairs outside the diner.  Jim, what's going on?  Oh, hey guys, it's Tim actually.  Hey Tim, what's up?  How you doing guys?  Yeah, I'm, I'm down here.  Um, I think two other people actually showed up to, uh, wish him off.  All right, good, good. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, if it's going good, it's, uh, it's kind of raining.  I think that's why most people didn't show up.  Well, we didn't really tell anyone to show up.  No, we just, just said it while they walked downstairs.  Well, I'm a faithful listener, so I'm showing up to wish him well.  It might be the last time we see Earl without, uh, you know.  So what do you think?  What's your feelings about this road trip for the guys?  I think it's, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, you gotta watch that F-wear.  You think it's going to be great?  Cool.  I think it's going to be great, man.  All right.  I got, I got my new wow sign with, uh, some good signs in case anybody shows up.  Mm-hmm.  It's going to be great, man.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Take it easy, guys. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Uh, let's go to Steve.  Hey, Steve, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Steve.  Hey.  There you go.  There was your chance.  Jack A.  All right, Rick.  Hey, guys.  We're back to you.  There's definitely a few cars that have, uh, pulled up since we got down here.  Okay.  And they're specifically waiting.  They're just sitting there waiting.  They're just waiting for, uh, you know, the guys to load up in the SUV and start heading  out to, uh, Winona. 
[00:19:30]  You think they're going to follow, or?  Um, I'm not sure.  Let me ask this one guy here.  He's in a, he's in a light car.  He's rolling down his window.  What's your name, dude?  Kenny.  Kenny, are you planning to follow the guys?  No, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm not going down there.  I don't have to go.  It's like maybe to the end of 57th Street, but that's about it.  That's about all.  There'll be some people out on the road going, oh my God, there's, there's the, the  Suburban.  There it goes.  It's got, uh, two huge Wow, uh, Metallica.  Wow Magnet, uh, stickers on the side of the truck. 
[00:20:00]  It's a big black Suburban that they use, uh, in town here when, when, uh, the President's  in town.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Rudy drives around in one of these things.  These guys will have a caravan all the way through Jersey.  I think so.  Yeah.  And then we'll see who, uh, has the balls to continue at that point.  All the way through Winona.  Uh, Rick?  Yo.  Uh, are we ready to rock or what?  Uh, I'm just waiting for the SUV to get here.  I'm going to ask this guy.  Hey, are you all going to be planning to, uh, follow the guys? 
[00:20:30]  Ah, no, we're just wishing them well.  All right.  So you got some cars pulling up.  Just pull up the guys well.  That's good.  They need a good bon voyage.  Yeah, but they're not committed to going.  No.  Is this guy going?  No.  Some wacko and a freaking truck just pulled up.  No.  I don't think anyone's going to go the distance.  No, I don't think so either.  But, uh, they'll help them get through Jersey, I'm sure.  All right.  Is, is the truck out front yet?  No.  Uh, not yet.  No.  We're just waiting.  It should be any moment. 
[00:21:00]  Like you said, there's not a lot of traffic, so it's not going to take them too long.  That's a good thing, too.  There's not a lot of traffic today.  MLK day.  Yeah, they'll get out of Manhattan nice and easy today.  Isn't it sort of a tribute that we're sending Earl to Mississippi?  Down there, down south, uh, uh, probably where, uh, most of the, the struggle was back  in the, uh, day.  And, uh, Earl will be down there.  Hey, Rick, can we, can we talk to the stinkmeister?  Yeah, I was just going to say, we wanted to talk to Stinky or Earl, but here's Stinky.  Okay.  What's up? 
[00:21:30]  Stinky!  Hey, guys.  Look at how happy you are.  I can tell you to go away for a week.  It's amazing.  You don't have to do anything except have fun.  Listen to your fish cassettes and then blow a joint once in a while.  Oh.  What are you talking about?  Exactly.  They've been told no pot on this trip.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Davey, Davey. 
[00:22:00]  Uh, Stink, you're going to have, like, I think, a caravan when you hit Jersey.  Yeah, there's really about, when Rick got out here, there was two guys, there's already  about 20 people and three cars.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Well, people are starting to realize, oh, my God, these guys are serious.  They're really doing this, and they're starting to show up.  There's a bunch of people on the phone lines going, guys, I'm already waiting for them on  the New Jersey Turnpike, awaiting the guys.  Hold on.  I've got to talk to this guy for a second, matter of fact.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Rob.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:22:30]  How's it going, man?  You're on the Turnpike.  Yeah, well, I'm right off of exit 8A.  Uh-huh.  There's a rest stop over there.  I'm waiting there.  They're about 30 miles south of Manhattan, so.  All right.  When those guys come by, man, I'm hopping with them, at least through Delaware, wherever  they're going.  Ah, see.  I'm going to be 95 with them for a couple states.  And you got a cell phone?  Yeah, I got a cell phone.  I got my buddy in the car with me.  Because I want you guys to report, too, you know, hey, I just drove by the Suburban.  It looks like girls fighting with Stinky in the backseat.  We want to know everything, all right?  All right.  I got a sign, too, that, uh, a nice poster board sign that I'm going to hold up a couple 
[00:23:00]  times for him.  What is it?  Some good laughs or something.  What does the sign say?  It says, hey, wow, you guys suck.  Nice.  Cool.  All right, guys.  You guys suck, man.  And what rest stop you at?  I'm at, um, the Molly Pitcher rest stop.  All right.  Right down past A's at 8A.  8A.  All right, cool.  Maybe they'll, uh, stop in there real fast.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Take care.  Thank you.  Scott from, uh, Richmond, uh, checking in.  It's like, uh, all the people lining up to wish the Titanic good luck on its maiden voyage.  Ooh.  Everyone was all happy at the beginning of that trip. 
[00:23:30]  We all know how that went wrong.  Uh, Manny.  Oh, yeah.  Manny.  What's happening, gentlemen?  What's up?  I got a little, uh, advice for, uh, Earl there.  Yeah.  Coming down a turpike in the Suburban, you gotta sit in the backseat.  There's a lot of racial profiling, first of all.  Racial profiling on the turnpike.  What was that?  So sit in the backseat.  Yeah.  Second thing, I got a care pack for him.  I got a Jersey PBA card for him.  Mm-hmm.  I got a Tootsie Roll, but he can't bite his finger off. 
[00:24:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Sir, sir.  It's MLK Day.  Come on.  2001 commemorative KKK.  Get out of a lynching card for him if he wants it.  Thank you, Manny.  All right.  Hey, uh, Rick.  Rick?  Yeah, Rick.  Yeah, the fat hoopy is here.  The fat hoopy?  Yeah.  Do you hear the stereo system on the same thing?  Take a look for this. 
[00:24:30]  That's the stereo?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Is that Darth Vader's song playing?  Yep.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was from Apocalypse Now.  That's the stereo system in the Suburban?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I mean, it's correct.  He's got a video screen up on the top near the dash where the CD player is. 
[00:25:00]  Right, right.  He's got some wild stuff in here.  Jesus.  It's Sheriff Buford T. Justice, a picture on the message board.  Sheriff Buford T. Justice with his finger at Stinky's face.  Very good.  Obviously, Stinky's face put on Burt Reynolds' body.  All right, Rick, we ready to send him off?  Yeah.  Did you want to talk to Earl real quick?  Sure.  Why not?  Hey, Earl.  Earl.  What's up?  I need no speaking of answers.  Come on, Earl. 
[00:25:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  This phone sucks.  Earl, pull the phone a little further away from your mouth when you talk.  Is this what we're going to have to deal with for four days?  I'm sorry, guys.  We have to study a blast.  Oh, there it is.  Much better, Earl.  We're ready to rock, and traffic's starting to flow down a little bit.  People are looking around, beeping their horns.  We're ready to rock.  And how does the Suburban look?  This thing is amazing.  Yeah?  We've got a DVD player in here, a navigation system.  Ah, nice.  God, I'm jealous. 
[00:26:00]  I want to go, man.  I know.  Does it sound like fun?  Although we said the same thing about the Voyer bus.  Yeah, that's true.  Like, damn, I wish I was on it.  Until havoc struck.  Yeah, just make sure we have a good lawyer.  All right, Earl.  Ernie O'Checken and saying how proud Reverend King would be on this day.  Blacks and whites together in one vehicle driving down south.  Unbelievable.  Who thought we'd ever see the day?  This wouldn't have happened back in 1962. 
[00:26:30]  No.  Hey, Earl.  Yo.  Have you guys started taking pictures, or?  No, no, yeah.  We're just still packing up a little bit.  We're going to get a little bit more settled once we get on the road.  All right, you guys have got to start documenting everything.  Yes, sir.  All right, Earl.  Hey, put you back on with Rick, and then we'll be going in a few minutes.  Good luck and Godspeed, Earl.  Thank you, Eddie.  See you Thursday.  A lot of people worried about you, Earl.  Hang in there.  All right, guys.  They're just about packed up.  They're just strapped in.  Stinky's all strapped in.  You guys really rock?  Ready to go.  There it is. 
[00:27:00]  The vehicle.  They're ready to go.  And they're ready to go.  Like a shuttle launch.  They're all strapped in.  Marty's saying the first fight will begin when the first person passes gas.  Somebody starts farting.  It's all over.  Hey, Rick, make sure they get that calzone for Susie.  You got it, guys.  All right.  Sorry to have a way there.  All right.  Well, yeah, send them off if they're ready.  All right.  You guys ready?  Let's go.  There they go.  There they go.  There they go.  People are saying good luck to Earl. 
[00:27:30]  Look at that.  Because they don't think he's coming back in one piece.  Oh.  This is like the launch of a space shuttle or something.  Isn't it amazing?  It's a shuttle launch.  Everyone very excited.  Let's get out with another challenger.  Stay out the bushes.  All right, Rick.  All right, guys.  Let it.  There it goes.  There it goes.  There they go.  The suburban.  On their little adventure down to Winona, Mississippi, to visit the radio station WONA.  I can only imagine what adventures their trip will hold. 
[00:28:00]  Only the future will tell.  It's going to unfold in front of all of our eyes.  Yes.  Hey, John.  What's up?  Hey.  Not much, guys.  I'm bored.  Yeah.  I'm with the New Jersey State Police.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to give them an escort.  We're out of the state of Jersey.  Well, you know how escorts work.  Yeah, the last time we had an escort, we got a lot of people in trouble, so.  Oh, don't worry.  I'm part of the top team.  All right, John.  Make sure they get through Jersey.  I'll make sure.  What are they driving, anyway, besides the... 
[00:28:30]  I ain't telling you.  Why not?  If I go to escort them, how am I going to know what they look like?  Escort them.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  I'm hanging up on John.  What are the bets on us seeing a strangely reminiscent scene of the OJ chase down the highway in a couple of days?  The funny thing is, that's what you're going to have.  People following a little bit.  We need the helicopter view, though.  Yeah.  Let's go down. 
[00:29:00]  I'm just trying to get to my mother's house.  You know, if I...  I wasn't trying to escape with my disguise.  You know, I think if we asked nicely, we could get a helicopter in the air.  Yeah.  To report where the truck is.  Hey, any copters, go ahead.  Let it rip.  I would assume the Suburban is safe until it gets out of the listening range.  Yeah.  And then they're on their own.  Yep.  Then they are on...  That's it.  They're sent out on their own.  They are on their own.  No communication.  Just cell phone.  But they won't be able to hear the show.  It'd be very scary for them, I think. 
[00:29:30]  Kind of like what the astronauts have to go around the moon.  Oh, yes.  L-O-S.  Loss of signal.  Loss of the communique.  That's it.  Let's see.  This is how scared Earl should be.  This is coming in from Greg.  I talked to a friend who went to school in Virginia.  They refused to look at Martin Luther King Day as a national holiday, so they recognized  it as Robert E. Lee Day.  Oh, boy.  Larry.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up, Larry? 
[00:30:00]  I give it two hours into the trip until Earl starts screaming, help me, help me, help  me.  You think?  I bet you.  I don't know.  I think it'll hold out a little longer.  Once they really get...  Two hours and ten minutes.  Yeah, once they really start getting into it after a few hours, then it's going to get  a little dicey with them.  I think it starts getting ugly when the radio station fades away, and then they realize,  holy S, we are out here...  What are we doing?  ...by ourselves.  You guys better send another Jeep to pick one of them up, because one of them is going  to be thrown out of the Jeep before they get through Jersey. 
[00:30:30]  We'll have to wait and see.  Hey, if anyone could see the Suburban with the big wild magnets on the side, please give  us a call.  Yeah, let us know where they are, things like that.  Yeah, without a doubt.  I take care, guys.  All right.  Andrew, a little pissed off that we put Earl in charge of taking and uploading the pictures,  says, I hope he can upload them faster than he hangs them.  Yeah, that's true.  What do you want on this wall?  Bob, what's going on?  Hey, congratulations, guys.  On what?  Hey, you guys got a nice write-up in the paper.  Oh, on Newsday?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, Peter Goodman gave us some props on the rings and stuff.  Well, you know, it was nice to see, I kind of got filled in on everything that was really  going on, because I hadn't been, you know, I'd been on vacation, didn't know what was  going on with the hiring and firing, and, you know, it just goes to show, what do you  guys, three and a half years on the radio now?  Yeah, two and a half.  Two and a half?  You've been a while.  Hey, and you're doing the right thing.  I love you guys.  Hey, thanks, Bob.  You're the best.  Thank you.  Jason, number.  I'm hearing rumors they're going to roll out a new lineup sometime this week.  Really?  Yeah.  Rumors?  Rumors.  We'll see.  I can only imagine.  God.  I hope they're worthy. 
[00:31:30]  This will be our 10th new lineup.  Uh-huh.  I was thinking about it over the weekend.  10th new lineup?  At least.  Since we've been here.  At least.  Unbelievable.  We have stayed here like an anchor, and everyone around us has changed.  Yeah.  More than a few times.  Opie, Jason from Jersey brings up a great point.  I got 10 bucks that says the calzone doesn't last any more than 10 minutes after Stinky  who smokes his first joint.  Imagine that.  After puffing, and there's a nice calzone right next to you.  That is not making it. 
[00:32:00]  There's no effing way you would just chomp into that thing.  That's funny.  Rick, how does it look down there?  A lot of those streamers and poppers going off and champagne being popped.  Oh, no.  Not at all.  Bon voyage.  Bon voyage.  If anything, people were looking at Earl going, good luck, man.  They didn't say anything to any of the white guys.  They just looked at Earl and said, hey, Earl, really?  Good luck.  Earl is definitely nervous.  I can tell.  Oh, yeah.  He's freaking a little bit.  Nick, checking in, guys.  The carload of misfits just passed my building, 57th and 10th. 
[00:32:30]  They are doomed.  They've gone three blocks so far.  All right.  And they did have about, as soon as they pulled away from the curb, about four or five  cars, like, zipped up behind them.  Really?  I don't know if it was pursuit or it was just they were following.  All right.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know what's going to happen?  As soon as they get out of the listening area, it's going to be like when the Vietnam  fighter pilots went feet dry over the north.  Yeah.  All the ass is going to hit the sands.  You cross that line.  It's all over. 
[00:33:00]  Triple A, sands.  It's going to be ugly.  Shake it easy, guys.  Drop your load and get back.  Bye-bye.  That's pretty funny.  All right, Anthony.  Why don't we take a break?  All right, man.  They're off.  They're off and running to Winona, Mississippi.  If you see them on the road, please give us a call if you've got a cell phone.  Yeah.  Very curious to see how the boys are doing.  All right?  Right.  And rumor has a lot of people are going to follow them through Jersey, at least.  Follow them down.  Yeah.  One guy said he's going to make it into Delaware, so.  Yeah.  I have a dream today that Earl makes it back in one piece. 
[00:33:30]  I have a dream.  All right.  We'll get an update after these, okay?  Right.  And, of course, we've got to talk about Giants and stuff.  Ah.  My machine owes me a hundred bucks.  On the map.  My petting's getting very good with this show.  I was watching that game yesterday going, holy S, the Giants are going to the Super Bowl.  Did anyone else have that in their mind?  Like, what? 
[00:34:00]  Blow them out.  Blow them out.  We've got to get into that.  Yeah, but congratulations to the Giants fans out there.  Yeah.  Way to go, guys.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  O.B.  Anthony.  They talk so fast, I can't make out all the dirty words.  What is this?  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  All I have to say is, holy S, the Giants are in the Super Bowl.  That's right.  Congratulations to the Giants fans out there.  Yeah, boy, that was quite the little blowout. 
[00:34:30]  They made the Vikings look a little bit silly on that field yesterday.  That was too bad.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, I heard you're really a pretty...  Hello?  Hello.  You're Opie?  Yeah.  You said you're pretty, Opie.  I heard you're a pretty big Baltimore fan.  Is there any truth to that?  Everyone knows I can't pick a winner, so...  For all the Giants fans out there, go Ravens!  Go Ravens!  I haven't picked a winner in over a year. 
[00:35:00]  It's been a while.  It's been a very long time.  Having trouble with that.  Actually, someone was on line 10.  Did they hang up or did Jesse hang up on them?  They were begging me to pick the Ravens in the Super Bowl.  Begging me, saying, please, oh, pick the Ravens.  Yeah.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  Bye.  They just hung up?  All right, Jess.  That's quite the blowout, and much to the chagrin of the Vikings.  It sucked, because I'm a sports fan.  I was really looking forward to watching that game yesterday. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  It was over in the first 10 minutes, which is great if you're a Giants fan, because then  you're just like, how ugly is this going to get, and you're really into it, but if you're  kind of like a Jet fan looking in like that, I was hoping to enjoy the game a little bit.  Well, yeah, like you said, if you're a Giants fan, though, it's the last...  It's the last game before the Super Bowl.  You don't want the close game to keep it exciting.  You just want your team in the Super Bowl.  No, because, I mean, when my team's getting that predicament, which is very rare these  days, you really... 
[00:36:00]  It's a lot of fun to watch your team run up the score.  Yeah.  You just make them, like, silly.  They did.  Man, they got trounced.  And what happened with all the smack that the Vikings were talking?  What happened to the smack?  I think we got a little Viking song.  This is hysterical.  I love the hindsight songs after the team totally loses.  You remember the fun we have with all the Mets songs.  Who let the Vikes out?  That's it.  Every song, every team had their who let the whatever out. 
[00:36:30]  And the Vikings, not to be outdone, had their own who let the Vikes out song.  Now, you know what?  The only thing that sucks about a New York team being in any championship is that the  songs now come out of the woodwork.  The bad Giants songs now.  You watch.  Until the next two weeks, until the Super Bowl, it's just going to be some of the worst songs.  And we'll play them, God damn it.  We'll be playing a few of them.  We'll play every God damn one of them. 
[00:37:00]  If it means we don't have to talk two more minutes, that's fine.  We'll play them.  Yeah.  I'm sure Air 6 pens are running out of ink as we speak.  I'll leave those guys alone, man.  No, I'm just saying.  You know how it is.  Every time there's a New York team in the championship, there's 20 songs.  Tom, what's going on?  What's doing, boys?  Hey.  I sent you guys up those Chris Samsonite t-shirts last week.  You got them?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  Cool.  No problem.  Opie, you talking about your team's ever blown anybody out?  Yeah.  Knicks are up 25, buddy.  I know.  You notice I'm not really talking Knick basketball. 
[00:37:30]  I don't want to jinx them.  Don't jinx them.  Because you know what?  When they're out of the limelight, they're doing all right.  They're doing real well without you.  They're doing real good.  Just like I told you guys last year.  Knock on wood.  All right.  Go Jets.  Thanks.  Later, buddy.  And my Islanders won over the weekend, Anthony?  Yes.  Yes, your Islanders.  Went to the game.  Want to thank Ted and the gang over there at the Coliseum for hooking me up.  Real nice.  Oh, really?  Where'd you sit?  Like in the corner.  Yeah.  You know.  It's so close.  Well, Joey Paisano.  I should get him on the phone because, you know, I call Ted when I want tickets for 
[00:38:00]  the Islander games.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow, Mario Lemieux coming to the Coliseum.  This is a pretty big game to check out, you know?  Oh, yeah.  So I just casually ask, you know, call up Ted and leave a message that, hey, Ted, if  you could find your heart, I would love a couple tickets, you know?  Yeah.  And then I told, I called Joey because he's a huge Islander fan.  I said, Joey, I'm going to the game.  And he goes, well, how do you get tickets?  And I said, well, I think I'm going to the game.  I called Ted.  He goes, dude, this is like the hardest ticket to get.  Are you insane?  I go, what?  I know Lemieux's coming to town.  He goes, not only is Lemieux coming to town, they're retiring Bill Torrey's, you know, bow 
[00:38:30]  tie.  All the old Islanders are coming back.  This thing has been sold out like for months.  Turns out this guy, Ted, who's a pretty big wig in the organization over there, gives me  his own personal tickets.  Now I feel like an idiot.  Why?  Because now, well, his girlfriend was supposed to use the tickets.  So now, like, he's got to figure out where to, but the girlfriend, because he's giving  me his tickets.  I'm like, Ted, you could have just told me, you know, no, I'll, you know, I'll go watch  him when they play, you know, a crappy team. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So was it packed?  It was packed.  It was a great time.  And we beat the Penguins.  It was a lot of fun.  Who did they parade out on the guys?  The Islanders?  Yeah.  Gillies, Bossy, you don't know any of these names.  Yes, I do.  This was when they ruled.  Dennis Potvan.  Was Bobby Nystrom out there?  Bobby Nystrom, Jerry Hart, Trottier did a little video presentation.  I did Jerry Hart's pool back when I was a pool dude, and I would install pools.  I had a cleaning contract, and I used to go on, vacuum is pool. 
[00:39:30]  Very nice.  Eddie Westfall.  Yeah.  Eddie Westfall.  I counted for all those guys, too.  Did you?  All of them at the Huntington Crescent Club.  It was good to see all those guys.  Wow.  It was fun.  Good ticket.  Huh?  Good ticket, and no empty seats.  None.  That's odd.  No, none.  Even for a big event.  Come on, I'm kidding.  Give the organization a break.  We're trying, Anthony.  We're trying.  I understand.  We need support from our fellow Islanders.  People that live on Long Island, Anthony, or used to. 
[00:40:00]  They've got a good young team.  Sorry.  Standings ain't showing it, but we'll be back eventually.  I'm in no man's land now, because I'm not from Long Island anymore.  But if you talk to anybody that's from Brooklyn, I'm not from Brooklyn either.  I live in Brooklyn, but I can't say I'm from Brooklyn, because only people from Brooklyn  can say they're from Brooklyn.  No, you live in Brooklyn, okay?  They take it that far?  You're not from Brooklyn.  I'm from Brooklyn. 
[00:40:30]  You live in Brooklyn.  So it's like, hey, where are you from?  I'm like, New York.  I live in the state of New York.  Yeah.  They get very serious about that.  Brooklyn pride.  Unsurpassed.  It's really cool to live there, by the way.  Right.  But I'm from nowhere now.  I am a nomad.  You're just living in Brooklyn.  That's it.  Can't be from Brooklyn.  Very nice.  Let's go to the phones.  Stinky's going to be checking in in a minute here.  Josh, what's up? 
[00:41:00]  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Pretty good, R.N.  What's it called?  I want to talk about that.  I work for Bloomberg Radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, and what's it called?  I heard that you guys are going to be syndicated out in Washington.  Is that true?  Oh, yeah?  Well, I can tell you what I know.  Like two, three weeks ago, they decided to start running like a best-of show on WJFK down there.  Right.  Opie and Anthony best-of show, four or five hours on like a Saturday, I think it was.  Yeah.  And then Ant and I royally screwed up, and they pulled it. 
[00:41:30]  So we had some type of syndication for a day.  For a day.  For one day.  That's the God's honest truth.  We had it all set up.  We were going to start at least a weekend show and then see what happens.  And your pals screwed up again, and they pulled the show.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  You guys are going to get it.  I guarantee it within a month.  All right, Josh.  Thank you.  No, thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Bye.  Josh knows, Anthony.  Did they start chanting, beat your wife, Potman?  Did they?  No.  No?  No.  That was always a fun chant. 
[00:42:00]  No, don't stink like that.  Yeah, if you're a Ranger fan.  All right, Stinky.  What's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  We just got to the Lincoln Tunnel, and we're stopped at a gas station filling up in gas.  Right in Hoboken, Dan's hometown.  There they are there.  Dan from Hoboken returning to his hometown.  Wow.  So, Stinky, anything happening?  I know you've only been on the road 20 minutes, but what has been going on so far?  Just, like, getting to know each other, you know, shooting the S and stuff, and just 
[00:42:30]  we just got some new world.  There hasn't been a brawl yet?  No, no fights yet.  He might even come back wearing some color.  Who knows?  Okay, check your scorecards, people.  New York, no fights.  They've made it through these five miles.  Let me tell you something about Earl, though.  You've taken them out of his habitat.  Right.  Even when you take those scary Bengal tigers out of the goddamn forest and you put them  in a cage, they're not as frightening, are they?  They're taking you out of your habitat. 
[00:43:00]  Earl?  Hey!  Ring the bell!  Ring the bell.  Earl, when was the last time you left New York City?  What's up?  Give me Earl for a sec.  Hold on.  Hello?  Earl.  Hey, hello.  You're saying ring the bell, but seriously, when was the last time you left New York City?  To do anything?  September of 99.  I went to London.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, London.  Well, look at that.  All right.  Earl, you having fun so far on the road? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, we're having a blast.  Is anyone following you still, or have they given up?  I'm not really sure, because we stopped for gas.  We had a lot of cars honking their horns while we were in the tunnel.  Yeah.  All right.  Are you guys still at the gas station?  We're still at the gas station.  We're about to pull out any second now.  Just a matter of...  A gas station in Hoboken on the other side of the tunnel there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going to go to a calzone.  We're right near Rite Aid.  Okay.  The calzone.  Now, make sure Stinky doesn't eat the calzone when he starts getting the munchies. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, he's got this big, goopy grin on his face already.  Get like five calzones.  That way, one might make it down.  You know he's going to eat them.  All right.  Yeah, well, a couple of the gas guys, they're scoping out the car.  They're like, what does wow mean?  Oh, really?  We'll be explaining it to them.  If you want to see the Suburban before it leaves our listening area,  it's a big black Suburban with wow magnets on the side and on the back and stuff. 
[00:44:30]  You can't miss it.  No, no.  You'll see it.  All right, Earl.  I'm the Negro in the back.  Have you guys taken any pictures yet?  No, we haven't.  We're still kind of getting a little bit settled.  Oh, my gosh.  We just kind of threw everything in the back seat.  You've got to document this beginning to end.  Stink's got the video camera.  Take some still pics and stuff.  Look, I'll start taking a few stills once we...  They're going to come back with nothing.  I know they're ready.  Absolutely.  You know what they're going to do?  We'll be fine, guys. 
[00:45:00]  They're going to stop off in Atlantic City.  They're just going to gamble, come back, and say, oh, yeah, we had a great time.  Right.  Oh, you forgot the eight balls and hookers.  Oh, damn it.  Turn around.  What's wrong?  We're going to duck one of them roadside waitresses from those trucks.  Yeah, we're going to slam a roadside waitress on one of those stops.  Wait, get Scott...  Unsolved mystery.  Get Scott the driver on, because this guy is out of his mind.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  I heard him yelling something in the background.  Who abducted this young waitress? 
[00:45:30]  Hey, Scott.  How's the plan?  Hello.  Hey.  Scott.  Hey, what's up?  We heard you pitching in the background.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  You know, the usual.  Nobody's getting along in here.  I don't know what the hell they're trying to tell you.  It's, you know...  Hold on.  What?  Left here?  No, straight.  Straight.  Oh, they're on the road again.  Sorry, guys.  They're trying to figure out how to get back on the road.  No, you said you wanted to grab a waitress or something, Scott?  No, no, no.  We're going to do that when we get out of state. 
[00:46:00]  We don't need any problems up here.  All right.  Cross the state line.  That's a man.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Against the will.  That's kidnapping.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  All right.  We'll let you guys go for a while, all right?  All right.  We'll call you back soon.  All right.  Cool.  See you.  All right.  There they go.  On their way to Winona, Mississippi, Anthony.  If you see the Suburban with the big wow signs all over it, please...  Show your support.  And please give us a call and, you know, tell us if you're seeing anything unusual over there.  Okay.  And ladies, a wow isn't out of the question either. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Help these guys out.  They got a long trip ahead of them.  Whip them out.  Winona.  That's what wow stands for on their vehicle.  The first two or three hours are going to be a piece of cake.  After that, it's going to be a real drag.  It's going to be rough.  When the show goes off the air, they're out of the listening audience.  They're going to be like, oh, what did we get ourselves into here?  But call us if you see them on the road.  Okay.  Did you want to play the Viking song yet?  Yeah.  This is great.  This is so bad.  This Viking song. 
[00:47:00]  How original to Who Let the Dogs Out.  Oh.  And it's so bad.  It's one of those stock sports team songs where they have to get the names of the players,  fit some clips in from some of the play-by-play.  And then in hindsight, it's so embarrassing when they just get blown out.  I thought Vinny and the Jets was a real good song last year.  What about Lenny and the Mets from 86?  Well, Vinny and the Jets, a rip-off of Lenny and the Mets. 
[00:47:30]  Lenny and the Mets, of course.  Who didn't see that?  All right.  You want to play this damn thing?  Here we go.  Let's hear this.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Oh, this song is very embarrassing today.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Colt-Members passing into the end zone, and it is caught.  It's a touchdown by Chris Carter.  Who's wrong?  Try again, dumbass.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Play action by Burlite.  Hit, fumbles.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Ball's loose, and the Vikings have it.  Who's wrong? 
[00:48:00]  Try again, dumbass.  This is stacked by Don Randall.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  The Vikings are blowing this bad boy up early.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  The Metrodome is rocking and rolling.  This is a list of runs out.  It will pass.  Lawson Carter catching the end zone.  Minnesota Vikings kicking some nature.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Who Let the Vikes Out. 
[00:48:30]  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Who Let the Vikes Out.  Who let the Vikes Out.  Hit that quarterback in the mud.  Hit the ball, now that's the word.  Global Pride, let your voice be heard.  Left side, ten, five.  Dive in, Robert.  Yes.  A touchdown for the Minnesota Vikings.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  So caught by Moss.  Touchdown.  Tremendous catch by Randy Moss.  Wrong. 
[00:49:00]  Try again, dumbass.  Two CDs today.  It's going to be a touchdown.  Randy Moss.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  It's good.  Dante's Inferno continues to burn.  He has three CDs today.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Ouch.  Yeah, ouch.  41-0 yesterday.  Who blew the Vikes Out.  Yeah.  Go ask yourself. 
[00:49:30]  Is that horrid?  I mean, who gets together and goes, yeah, we're going to get a Viking song.  Let's do it to Who Let the Dogs Out.  Because that hasn't been done before.  Does every sports team in every state for every single sport have a Who Let the Whatever  Out song?  I'm sure there's like a thousand versions of that song out there.  Hey, Mike, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  That song was great, by the way.  Yeah.  I just want to say, the Giants victory, there's only one way to explain it. 
[00:50:00]  LT handing out crack to the players before the game.  Poor LT.  I mean, come on, really.  You've never seen them like that since 86.  That was an insane game for you guys.  There's no other way to explain it, man.  Yeah, all right.  Crack.  Thank you, man.  Poor LT.  Anytime the Giants get in the limelight, you've got to bring back LT with his cracking horse.  Jay, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Huge Giants fan, man.  I just got to say, that game was awesome.  You realize about five minutes into the game that the Giants are going to kill him, and  the rest of the day, I just got hammered. 
[00:50:30]  It was ridiculous.  All day, just boozing it up.  And did you guys hear that comment by Randy Moss after the game?  What did he say?  Oh, he's such a pussy.  Oh, he's crying.  He goes, if Chris Carter wants to win the Super Bowl, I suggest he doesn't come back  to the Vikings, because he has no chance winning one here.  Oh, God.  It's a big baby, man.  The Vikings go back to Minnesota.  And I got to say, the black girl has about as much chance as the Ravens do.  Oh, God.  Thank you, Jay.  Take it easy, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was one of those games, though, after the first five minutes, you're like, holy 
[00:51:00]  ass, this is going to be a blowout.  You kind of knew it was going to have to.  Just like that guy said, you can just sit back and enjoy it with your friends if you're  a Giants fan.  Yeah.  One of those games, though, that if it was the Jets, they'd still have managed to blow  it.  Yeah, one of the jokes I heard was, the only way the Giants were going to blow that game  is to put Vinny in.  Vinny!  I'm like, grrrr.  But there's nothing I can say today.  Yeah.  Absolutely nothing.  Didn't we have that other Vikings song?  Do we have that rap one? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, we got to get that one, too.  Yeah.  We'll get that one.  Yeah, we have another Vikings song we'll play for you guys.  There's so many.  Are there any Giants ones yet?  They'll come out soon.  I got to hear some.  Huh?  I haven't heard any yet.  Uh, Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I, um, I know Anthony, two weeks ago, was talking about how Clinton's not going to be, um, sorry  to change the subject, but Clinton's not going to be president anymore, and if his wife's  going to be upstate...  Wait, hold on, hold on.  What the S just happened in the Knick game?  What is there, bro? 
[00:52:00]  I saw an instant feedback about it.  Marcus Camby would swing.  Camby hit Van Gundy.  But I don't think it's actually, yeah.  Camby hit...  What?  He hit Van Gundy.  Wait, what happened?  If someone could tell me, because, uh...  We have the...  What happened?  Some woman called up.  Uh, he, like, got into a fight with another player, and then, like, punched out Van Gundy,  apparently.  In the heat of it or something.  I didn't see the thing.  Did he punch him out on purpose, or, like, it was like, uh...  It was like, oops, I meant to hit this guy, and I nailed you in the jaw. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know, man.  If someone knows the story, help us out.  It's, uh, the Knicks are, uh, killing the Spurs, 99 to 78.  Marcus Camby just knocked out Van Gundy.  We were in the middle of a call with the guy, and I was...  The Knick game is, uh, to my left here, and all of a sudden, I saw the replay with Van Gundy.  It looked like he was out cold, didn't it?  Gonna be talking about that, uh, for about 24 hours.  What kind of punch did he use?  Yeah.  I think he should have went to the body a couple of times first, and then maybe smacked him in the head. 
[00:53:00]  Uh, Anthony, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  Hey.  Oh, Van Gundy got his lights cleaned.  Oof.  He did, you saw it?  Yeah, he got clipped.  And, uh, Cammy did it by accident?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Taking a shot at somebody else.  It was like what happened with Oakley when he was holding on to his leg.  Yeah, that was funny.  Let me tell you, though, if you're taking a shot at someone else, it doesn't matter.  If you hit somebody, he's gone.  Van Gundy looked...  I don't want to go to school today, Mommy.  Yesterday at the Giant game, from the tailgate to the end of the game, 
[00:53:30]  you know those schmuck Viking fans that showed up with those little foam Viking hats?  Yeah.  Oh, abused.  Oh, abused.  Beer, nachos.  This chick looked like she got baptized.  Hey, Mikey, Van Gundy takes a left, and he's out.  Down for the count.  Isn't that in the stand in eight?  You guys rock, man.  Thank you.  You know what's pathetic about the Giants going to the Super Bowl, by the way?  What's pathetic?  It just shows our luck here at WNEW. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, right.  What radio station had the Giant games last year?  Oh, WNEW, your giant station.  Remember?  That was the only thing we had.  And they sucked.  And they took that away from us.  And as soon as they leave this place...  Yeah.  They're going to the Super Bowl.  They're winners.  They're going to the Super Bowl.  And then if you turned on the radio, NEW, I guess last night, you heard the Ravens game.  Like anybody gave a flying F.  Anyone that cared was watching it on TV. 
[00:54:30]  They weren't like tooling around town going, oh, my God, I need to...  I got to hear the Ravens game.  I need to listen to the Ravens game.  Yeah, any winners, you got to leave here.  Hey, Will, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Yo.  By the way, he didn't actually hit them with his fist.  No?  He kind of...  Van Gundy kind of went to jump in his way to stop him from going after Danny Ferry.  And he kind of head-butted him a little bit.  And he knocked him down.  Knocked him out cold.  And he had blood on his forehead and everything.  We'll be seeing that clip on the news about a hundred times. 
[00:55:00]  He's going to be out for a couple of games.  Yeah.  The guy caught him before.  The Ferry caught him before with some kind of cheap shot.  Yeah.  They kicked Ferry out.  And as Ferry was walking off the court, I don't know what the hell got into Kambi.  He just went after him.  Right.  And Van Gundy went after him to kind of get in between them.  And it wasn't a good move for him.  All right.  Thank you, Will.  Peace.  Andrew from Jersey.  Opie is sports poison.  Nothing was happening in the game until Opie speaks and the coach gets creamed. 
[00:55:30]  It's mental.  I swear to you.  You are a pisser, man.  First time I've talked about the Knicks in, what, a month?  And minutes later, Van Gundy gets pretty much knocked out by Kambi by accident, it's sounding  like now.  All right.  Let's take a break.  All right.  We could either take a break, Anthony, or we could play something very disturbing.  I always go for disturbing.  All right.  I like disturbing.  This was the hit of Friday's show, and it's worth a replay today. 
[00:56:00]  It's like a vacation day today, isn't it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  We're the only live show.  We can play some stuff.  It's Stalker Patty's fake-o from Friday.  Oh.  This is deeply, deeply disturbing.  Oh.  So we'll play this again.  Eh.  We'll take a break.  Oh.  And we'll check in with Stinky and the crew to see where they are in their little road  trip to Mississippi, okay?  All right.  All right.  Stalker Patty from Friday.  Doing a fake orgasm. 
[00:56:30]  Yum, yum, give me some.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, sir.  I got a treat for you today.  What?  Ah, Stalker Patty.  Hey, how are ya?  Hey, what's up?  Stalker Patty.  I wanted to call him a soapy stock with this, uh, stalker thing.  And just to say hello, and, Jim, I'm not mad at you.  You're not?  No, not at all.  Oh, because you seemed upset that I told you to hang yourself and meant it.  Oh, I'm sure you didn't mean it.  I'm sure it was only in fun.  No, I was just trying to be funny, just picturing you swinging dead. 
[00:57:00]  That is funny, isn't it?  Like your nipple hair.  All right.  But anyway, I won't keep you on long, okay?  Did you get rid of that nipple hair?  What?  You got rid of that?  I'm sorry?  You took care of that?  You took care of your nipple hair?  It's going to make you pew.  Isn't Patty having her hair removed soon?  Tuesday.  What hair?  Tuesday.  Hey, Jamaican Mike, write that on your goddamn calendar.  We'll be in here Tuesday.  You know what I'm going to do?  I got it.  After I'm free of it?  What?  I'm going to come in and wow you, Opie. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  She seems a little frisky after you.  Frisky in the new year.  In the pocket.  Yo, yo, check this out.  Does she sound a little more frisky?  A little bit more sexual after Noah felt her up?  Opie.  And now she's having the nip hair removed?  I know.  I'll tell you why, too.  What's up?  Doc changed the medication.  Yeah, exactly.  What?  I don't take medication.  This is me.  Or natural.  So, who's removing...  Oh, natural.  You want to give up?  Be felicio.  Relax. 
[00:58:00]  Well, let me go, guys.  Have a great day.  Hold on, Patty.  I have a question.  I know you're having the nipple hair removed.  Who's operating the weed whacker?  I don't know what the weed whacker is.  I didn't think you would.  No.  But that's okay.  No, it won't hurt me.  Were you mad that I felt your breast that time on the air?  No.  Did you like it a little bit?  No.  No?  I was just having fun.  Wow, she wasn't turned on by you.  You weren't turned on at all?  Oh, no, I like you.  You're a nice person.  You're very sweet.  Oh, that voice isn't irritating. 
[00:58:30]  I give you a chance.  Imagine that.  Hey, Patty, how about a fake-off?  Oh, wait a minute.  She gave you a chance.  What'd she say?  You gave me a chance with what?  A chance with a date.  Sure.  Oh, a date?  No.  You're ready to go from virginity to Norton.  My God.  I actually...  I would actually...  She's a nice person.  He's very nice.  Yeah, would you shut up and let him talk?  No, baby girl.  I would be glad to go on a date with you.  It depends, though, because I know I'm supposed to perform analingus on Big Kev. 
[00:59:00]  That takes priority.  You know, I'm not testing you after that because I don't hear well on this phone.  Really?  No, I was just saying that I'd love to go out sooner or later.  Do you like Kool-Aid?  I know that's probably what you didn't say, but that's okay.  She needs to glow in the dark.  All right.  Look, I'm going to go.  Don't go.  Patty.  Yes.  Patty.  Yes.  Since we're getting this new sensuous sexual Patty with your new sexy Patty voice and everything,  can you give us your impression of a fake O?  You know what I mean? 
[00:59:30]  I'm like, say you were all excited and worked up.  You're with a man.  What would it sound like, Patty?  What did the listeners do to deserve this crap today?  What would it sound like, Patty?  Give us a little, yeah, like a mmm, ah thing.  Mmm, like when you flip those fries at work, baby.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Let her rip.  A little moan, Patty.  Give a little moan of pleasure.  Oh.  Pretend you and Oprah are sitting there watching cartoons while you eat ice cream.  And you're going to go fellatio with five minutes. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Let the girl get in the mood now.  Patty?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Touch her pecs.  Let her go.  Will you shut up?  Patty.  What?  All right.  Now, relax.  Yeah.  And give some sensual moans of pleasure.  Go ahead.  A moan of pleasure?  Yeah, like moans of pleasure.  Can I do a little two seconds thing?  No, not two seconds.  Let it last ten seconds or so.  Ten seconds?  Yeah, go ahead.  Ow. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, dirty.  Shut up.  I know.  That sounds kind of sexy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, that was good.  I can't stop laughing now.  I keep breaking out laughing.  Well, everyone just shut up.  I want to hear this.  Patty.  Let her rip.  For ten seconds, your best moans of pleasure.  Oh.  Well, I can't get it at him.  Sorry.  No, no.  Just keep going. 
[01:01:00]  You're doing good.  Go.  Go.  Go.  You sound like Jean Stapleton with her nipple caught in the door.  Did you get that?  Is this going to be on a promo or whatever it is?  You do a soundbite or something?  Yeah, they're promoting Viagra.  They're excited to kill erections.  Will you do a long...  I guess I have to eat a little bit more thin if you read.  Do a longer than two second...  Hey, parrot lungs. 
[01:01:30]  Do a five second moan.  Stop with the two second moans.  It's bugging everyone.  Opie wants to hear you moan.  You want to get an Opie's trouser up?  You must really be bored.  He's not bored.  He's nauseous.  The sound you're hearing is all the radio is turning to another station in the tricester area.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that's really sexy.  Was that good?  Yeah, very sexy.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry. 
[01:02:00]  My helmet just jumped off and ran.  I didn't ask her.  That's actually...  No, I don't even go there.  No, anything I say could be used against me.  That wasn't that bad.  No, I support a war.  That had potential.  That had potential.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Mike Z from Harrison, New Jersey says it all on the Instant Feedback.  My C just effing died.  Hey, Patty, can I ask you something?  Because you know we're just having a good old time with you.  Patty, it's Jim.  Yeah, I know.  Just to get the moan realistic, because I do actually think it's very sexy. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know how Opie feels, but I can speak for me.  Would you mind touching yourself?  Touch myself?  Yeah.  No, no.  Not anywhere private.  Just the place where you hide the car keys in your gum.  Could you touch that?  The place where I hide the what?  It looks like a furry tango hat with Limburger cheese on it.  Could you rub that?  I don't have any Limburger cheese.  Please just rub that for a second.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Remember you wanted money and Uncle Phil made a deal? 
[01:03:00]  That place.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  It's doing a bad job to me.  That noise will haunt me.  It's awful.  That's going to haunt me.  I'll be in your nightmares, Opie.  Donna, no, you're already in my nightmares.  Trust me.  I know.  Donna, what's going on?  I'm here in my too.  I want to put this girl out of her misery.  Why, what's up?  You ready?  Yeah.  This is how a true woman moans, okay?  All right.  All right.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[01:03:30]  All right, Patty, now your turn.  Patty, go ahead.  Do the same thing, Patty.  Patty, go ahead.  Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  How is that?  You sound chilly.  Well, I hear some applause in the background.  He's clapping because you stopped.

[01:07:00]  Stalker Patty.  Patty, your grand finale.  And throw some words in there, Patty, because she was throwing some words in.  Yeah.  You're getting the hang of it.  Okay.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Keep on going.  Oh, my God.  It sounded like she had the dentist.  I guess I'm more at the silent side.  Patty, you have the sex appeal of Norman Fell. 
[01:07:30]  Take a knock on my door.  Don't have to talk to somebody like Laura Korn, who knows all the answers.  All right.  Listen, Donna, thank you.  Thank you.  Stalker Patty, thank you.  You're welcome.  It was fun.  Patty, you hang up.  Donna, you stay on hold, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Okay, bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's take a break.  Let's take a break so we can all puke together.  A Norman Fell reference.  I'm dying.  That's brilliant.  Norton is killing today. 
[01:08:00]  Hold on.  I think Patty wants to go one more time.  Okay.  Wow, that's hot.  She sounded like the exorcist.  You got a lot of that in the hood there?  I wanted to know what we could get a little hepatitis, please, like a sip of somebody's drink.  Anthony, if you will, I think we could really turn on our listeners.  Yeah.  If you will, Stalker Patty, moaning again, please. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, good God. 
[01:09:00]  That's what you get for faking orgasms, bitch.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll be back.  Well, there's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's ONA.  1027 WMEW.  212-757.  1027 is our phone number.  The ONA Show.  Lots going on today, Anthony.  One of the only live radio shows in New York today.  Yeah.  A lot of people took MLK Day off.  We've had enough days off. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, we figured we owed it to you guys to come in.  We get days off when we don't want days off.  Yeah, believe me.  Then we figure we got to make up for it.  I believe we're going to be speaking with former President Reagan on the phone opening.  Yeah.  Got his personal phone number to his hospital room.  He had a little trouble.  Fell down and broke his hip.  Broke his hip.  What is he doing up at all? 
[01:10:00]  Like, why walk around?  It's nothing.  He's not going to remember anything.  Well, he's trying to live, Anthony.  I mean...  Oh, please.  The living part's over, Johnny.  You know?  It's over.  What's interesting, though, a lot of people are on TV and saying, you know, this is it.  This is it.  It's it for the Gipper.  You know, when the old people break their hip, this is it.  Yeah.  Goes downhill fast.  But you made a good point.  We're talking about Reagan.  He's like a superhero at this point.  The guy's amazing.  Shot.  He's had cancer.  And this is years ago. 
[01:10:30]  Alzheimer's.  You're talking 20 years ago.  The guy got shot.  And then he's had, yeah, the Alzheimer's since he got out of office.  And he's still going.  And now the hip breaks, which is pretty much the death knell for the elderly, I'm sorry to say.  There are a few of them that could pull out of that.  Yeah.  But, I mean, if you're up there in age and you're not the healthiest guy, that's not a bad thing when the old hip breaks.  Because then you've got to stay in bed and just deteriorate. 
[01:11:00]  Poor Ronnie.  I was watching.  You ever see the thing, those old shows on, what is it, 2020?  They show the old ones.  I think MSNBC shows it.  And they go back like 20 years and show news clips.  And I saw one over the weekend with Reagan.  You forget.  And I'm not, because every time you say someone's a great president, then you've got the other side going, oh, blah, blah, blah.  Reagan was a great president.  He was very memorable.  And let me tell you something.  I lean Democrat.  Yeah.  I'm not necessarily a Democrat, but I lean that way. 
[01:11:30]  But I know what you're going to say.  They have been showing a lot of the Reagan footage lately.  And it's like, God damn, he was a freaking leader.  Whether you liked or hate what he had to do and say.  He did it.  He was a leader.  You can look at him and go, my God.  Yeah, when he took office, he kicked some ass.  He went against a lot of popular things and just did what he wanted to do and what he thought was best for the country.  And it seemed to work out for a time.  And they were showing old clips.  And it's just, you know, he was a badass taking on the Soviet Union. 
[01:12:00]  You know, that was a pretty big thing to do.  I saw a contrast over the weekend because between, you know, Reagan's hip break-in and the space shuttle disaster anniversary, we're up for 15 years already.  Hard to believe.  They're showing a lot of Reagan clips.  Yeah.  And they're also showing a lot of Clinton clips because he's leaving office.  And one of the things that was really interesting, when they had that memorial for the space shuttle astronauts, Reagan consoled every single member of the family. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  They showed that during the space shuttle show last night.  Yeah.  And you could just see it in his eyes.  The guy was sincere when he's, like, looking in their eyes and hugging them.  Or he was the best actor ever.  True.  But it looked good.  But the point I want to make, then they show Clinton doing that same type of stuff while he was in office the last eight years.  And you could see right through him, like, you don't give a crap.  How good is this going to make me look?  You just know he's, like, I'm supposed to look sad.  I'll do that bite the lip thing.  Right.  Give him the old thumb.  But Reagan, I mean, I think it was MSNBC did a great, great special on the space shuttle disaster. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  The Challenger thing.  No matter how many times I watch it, it always blows up.  Hate that.  But Reagan, very sincere.  With the, uh, slip the surly bounds of earth and touch the face of God.  Like, wow.  That's pretty good.  Who wrote that?  Yeah, we'll talk to him.  All right, but you got Reagan's phone number at the hospital?  Oh, of course I do.  All right, we'll do that in a while.  Who doesn't?  Can everybody have that?  And we got to get into the Mike Tyson story over the weekend. 
[01:13:30]  Brilliant.  Hilarious Mike Tyson story that you're not going to want to miss if you weren't reading the papers this weekend.  Something's wrong with this guy.  It was just a tiny, tiny little article in the Post about a paragraph.  Yeah.  But probably will give us about an hour of material today.  A story about Tyson and pets.  Right.  Well, why don't we check in with Stinky.  The road trip has begun to Winona, Mississippi.  Stinky and Black Earl and Dan from Hoboken and Scott the driver, okay?  Yeah.  Last we left them, they were through the tunnel getting gas in Hoboken. 
[01:14:00]  Uh, Stinky, what's going on?  What's up, Guy?  Yeah, we've officially started.  We're on 78, you know, a big highway.  And we're already stuck behind a woman setting her cruise control in the left lane at 60, trying to get around her.  Wow.  Earl's trying to get to sleep.  What happened?  He's playing it onto his phone like it's his only attachment to home.  Earl's trying to get some sleep?  Earl's trying to sleep already, you guys?  Yeah, he's got his hat over his eyes.  His sunglasses are on, even though it's super overcast.  All right, now, he would have been working had he been here. 
[01:14:30]  So why is he sleeping?  He should be awake.  This is because when he's working and he's in his cubicle, he sleeps during this time.  So he's used to it.  Why break the string?  This is nap time.  What else is going on, Stinky?  Anything to report?  Nah, nothing much.  We just got into Summit.  Okay.  New Jersey, and yeah, we just started the trip, so.  Yeah, I don't see anything really exciting happening until they start brawling.  No fight yet or anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many miles have you guys done? 
[01:15:00]  How many miles?  About 20, 30?  I don't even know.  His pedometer is in kilometers, so I looked over his shoulder, and it looked like he was  going 120, and I was so scared to realize it was 60.  Whatever it was.  All right, now, Stinky, any cars noticing you on the highway or?  Stinky?  Is this what it's going to be like?  Stinky?  Stink.  I'm here.  We lost you.  I asked if anyone noticed you on the highway. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  Some big 18 wheelers have been hocking and stuff like that, but nothing serious.  Yeah.  No coward man behind us.  Stinky, do you have the calzone?  Yeah, we have the calzone in the cooler.  They have the calzone in the cooler, I think.  Yeah.  I could read bad cell phones.  Bad cell phone?  Yeah.  All right, Stinky, we'll check in with you in a little bit.  All right, there he goes, Stinky.  His phone is breaking up.  The stinkmeister.  Hey, Anthony, you know who's outside the studio?  Who?  Q.  Yes, Q.  You might remember Q from past shows. 
[01:16:00]  He's a song parody writer.  As in, I'm horny for little girls.  Little girls.  Because little girls have hairless little.  I'm horny for little girls.  There he is.  His hit.  We're singing his hit.  We might have to break out the old tune today.  I'm horny.  The little girls.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Q.  Hey, Q.  He brought in a CD of a few songs, Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Cool.  And he's got a song about Stinky and Earl.  Ah.  That's pretty damn funny.  I've got to give it to you.  Going down to Mississippi.  Thank you.  Very funny.  Q, always pretty good with the songs.  It was a great song yesterday afternoon at some point.  Yeah.  Cool.  It works.  We were listening to it.  Cool.  Pretty funny.  I'm just trying to get him some headphones.  What do you got?  A studio in your house or something?  A poor studio.  Small cassette.  Little cassette thing?  Like what?  Like one of those old Fostex?  Fostex, four track, eight.  That's what you use?  Yeah.  Dude, it's the year 2001, for God's sake. 
[01:17:00]  That thing was hot in like 86.  Yeah, but you might understand this.  The words divorce mean anything to you.  God damn it.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  That's right.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  The last two years of my studio money went to my lawyer, so...  Oh, God.  See that?  That's got to hurt.  There is...  Well, that'll leave a bruise.  Why let a talent like Q, who could use the money to put together a nice digital studio...  No.  Give it to lawyers who need more money.  Oh, man. 
[01:17:30]  That's good.  And my wife, who really needs the money.  Yeah.  That's good.  Are you done, though?  No, I'm actually in the middle after two years.  Well, it's actually...  Oh, God.  It's actually been like a year, but I'm in the middle of it.  It's two years...  Damn you lawyers all the hell!  And, uh...  And I'm behind with the lawyer.  You are?  I'm thousands behind with the lawyer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, who isn't?  I don't know one person going through a divorce that goes, yeah, I'm right up to date on my  payments to my lawyer.  Yes.  But the good thing is my wife makes like 150 grand a year, so...  Oh, so you're going to try to snag some of that?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Nice.  You're going to put the shoe on the other foot.  Nice.  Someone's got to explain to me why a divorce takes two years.  It's all the lawyers do.  That's absolutely insane.  It's the...  Any kids or anything?  I have two kids, but they're grown, so...  Okay.  ...they're not part of the picture.  But the lawyers, I think lawyers are in cahoots.  I think they talk to each other, they figure...  Sure.  ...because whoever loses generally pays the lawyer's fees, so the lawyers get their money  either way.  Right.  They're getting paid.  They're getting paid either way.  And it just goes on and on.  And no one looks into it.  People are getting just screwed over left and right.  Like, this could have been wrapped up, but no. 
[01:18:30]  Most of these divorces, most of these divorce cases should take a week.  Nothing.  A week.  Tops.  Nothing.  Two years?  They keep postponing crap, is what happens.  Well, it depends on what people like to do.  Like, my wife just became very unreasonable and wanted me to...  I was going to sign a paper and walk away from it, but she actually...  Unreasonable.  No, she...  What she wanted me to sign was totally the anti-truth, so I just...  Yeah.  Yeah, I refused to sign.  I knew what was ahead.  I knew it was going to be years of hassle and stress and stuff, but...  Oh.  I just couldn't let it get away with this. 
[01:19:00]  See, they wear you down, too, to the point where it's like,  all right, I'll just sign something.  Get me out.  It's like the terrorists that grab you and want you to read their statements,  and at first you're like, screw you!  Go USA!  America!  I'm not doing this!  The army's going to come in and save us and everything.  And after, like, two years of being a captive,  the American system does not work.  Right.  You must rise up, people, for our brothers and Allah.  Yeah, and you're just like, it wears you down.  Yes, definitely.  It's very stressful, very stressful. 
[01:19:30]  Jeez, I bet you got some great divorce appearances.  No.  No, I'm worried.  I'm waiting until it's over, so...  Yeah.  Yeah, but I...  We look forward to that song.  I have a few ideas.  We look forward to the F.U. song from two.  I have a couple of songs that I've written for my wife,  but I don't think I would play them on the air.  No, huh?  No, it would just be one long bleep.  Yeah.  Hey, I gotta go back to the phones.  Mike picked up on something when we last talked to Stinky.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I was listening to the thing before,  and if you listen in the background, 
[01:20:00]  I think they're listening to that movie, you know,  your friend that you have,  he's saying,  kill, kill, kill, the white man in the background.  Kill, kill.  Oh, I see what you're trying to say.  Yeah, it's quite as far as it goes.  If you can look...  That's as far as it goes.  Apparently, the movie that they're watching...  Has killed the white man.  No.  You're getting it?  Opie doesn't even understand.  Like the people in that.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I guess.  Yeah.  Whatever. 
[01:20:30]  All right, let's play Q's song, Anthony.  All right.  He made a little ditty for Stinky and Earl  as they head to Mississippi.  Yeehaw.  And here it is.  Our buddy Q.  Well, his name is Black Earl  And he whines like a girl  Every time someone asks him to get busy  Yeah, he really likes the doors  And he wears black clothes 
[01:21:00]  But inside, he's whiter than a lily  Well, they'll load him in the van  With that wreath of smoking man  And try to make it down to Mississippi  If they break down all the way  What will those rednecks say?  You know they love them niggas and hippies  Black Earl and Stinky  Which one's gay?  Black Earl and Stinky  Rotting all the way  Black Earl and Stinky  Hide that J  Black Earl and Stinky  On W-O-N-A 
[01:21:30]  Well, Stinky's kind of crazy  And Earl's kind of lazy  They mix like oil and water  And when they get down south  They'll have to work it out  And get closer than a mother and daughter  And when she meets Black Earl  You may want to hurl 
[01:22:00]  Who knows what the girls will think  And Stinky  Even though he's from New York  There's a chance to get poor  And end up with some swapping on his wing  Yeah  Black Earl and Stinky  Which one's gay?  Black Earl and Stinky  Fighting all the way  Black Earl and Stinky  Hot that J  Black Earl and Stinky  On W-O-N-A  Black Earl and Stinky  On W-O-N-A  Black Earl and Stinky  On W-O-N-A 
[01:22:30]  Black Earl and Stinky  On W-O-N-A  Black Earl and Stinky  On W-O-N-A  Hey, look at that, Anthony  Nice  Very nice cue  Another hit  Yes, without a doubt  The Earl and Stinky song  I like that  That's a good one  I have one question  I have all these hits  And no money  How does that work?  That happens  You want a radio show?  Yeah  We have a few openings here  I've been listening  Yeah, I know you have a few openings  At M-E-W  Very nice  That's a good little ditty 
[01:23:00]  That's funny  That's exactly how I broke into the business, Q  Same thing  Doing dopey song parties  You come on the radio  And do it  I've been trying to write serious songs  For like ten years now  Give that up  Yeah  No, it doesn't work  The goof songs are where it's at  You've got to tell them  The goof songs  Thanks  How many years  I spent in rehearsal studios  And recording  Like songs that the band writes  And you know  You're hoping something happens  Nothing  Yeah  I write some dopey song  About O.J. Simpson  And I have a career  Is that how you started  With O.J. Simpson? 
[01:23:30]  Ah, yes  Did you play it on the show?  Have I heard it?  I think we played it once  We played it like once  I mean we can play it  As we go to break  It is the anniversary of the trial  Was just what  Yeah, this is the song  That got Ant and I together  I was doing a radio show  And it also has a new title  O.P.  Exhibit C  In evidence  Get out  Yeah, this actually is one of the songs  That I think the lawyers want to give a listen to  For what reason?  I have no clue  O.J.'s lawyers?  No  My lawyers  And the wife's lawyers 
[01:24:00]  Somehow figuring  You know  What could that possibly have to do with it?  I don't know  I wrote the whole thing  My brother did all the music  I don't know  I have no clue  I don't know of any third party  That had anything to do with this song  But  Let's talk to Joel  Who's a divorce lawyer  Joel  Hey scumbag ass F  First off  I'm not a divorce lawyer  I've done divorce work  And second  The reason it takes so long  Is New York doesn't want to be like Reno  Where you can get divorced in six weeks 
[01:24:30]  Why not?  Because they don't want to be like Reno  They just don't want to be like that  Oh sorry  So they want to make it hard and difficult  And drag it out  To discourage divorce  Sorry we allow people to get on with their lives  Discourage it  Yeah  If you want out  You just get out  Yeah  If you want to discourage your divorce  You don't get divorced  Right  It's not like it's a  Who in their right mind  Would get married in New York State  Knowing what could happen to you  If it goes bad  Without an 
[01:25:00]  And they did  Without an ironclad contract  That's it  Yeah  Prenup  Prenups are the way to go  And it helps us lawyers out even more  I got something better than a prenup  What?  No marriage  Works even better  It's got a no-nup  A no-nup  No-nup  So that's a good thing about New York  If you don't have recognized common-logged marriage  So you can live with her as long as you ever want  And nothing's going to happen  Is that it?  Yeah, I've heard that  No  Opie likes that one  No common-law marriages in New York  So they don't recognize it if you go to another state 
[01:25:30]  Where they do recognize common-law marriage  Although, let me tell you something  Even if you are just living with someone  Right  They can take you to court  They can go through the entire process  You will pay the legal fees  That is true  Even if nothing happens  It's still going to cost you money  Yeah  Our Florida's got to hook ourselves up somehow  So  Alright  Alright, have a nice one  Go kill yourself  Get in the coffin  No auto in Georgia  We're here today  Get in the coffin  Joe  Yeah  You're going to kill me  I left your parody song in the mailbox 
[01:26:00]  We'll play it tomorrow, man  I hear it's really good  Cowbell Bill and Anthony's brother Joe  Came up with a little ditty for Earl and Stinky  And I left it at home  I knew you guys would call  Wondering if we were going to play the song or not today  I effed up  If Steve is in, I can email it  Oh, really?  Sure  Yeah, Steve's definitely in  Alright, cool  Oh, cool, yeah  I'll pop it over to him  Send it over, man  Alright, Steve and family  Hold on, we'll get you  Yeah, we'll get you  Hold on  Alright, cool  Alright, there goes Anthony's brother Joe  Gonzo style checking in 
[01:26:30]  Divorce lawyers worse than AIDS  Yeah  Worse than  Well, worse than UPS  Which is worse than AIDS  They do more damage anyway  They do  Alright, Anthony  We have to take a break  I want to thank Q  Q  Bang up job again  Thanks  Always look forward to another Q parody  Another Q original  Yeah  On the ONA show  I gave you another one  I don't know if you could  Yeah, we're going to play the other ones as well  Definitely  What I want to do is play the song  That got Ant and I together  Here it is  Yes, I want to hear that  Here it is  As we go to break 
[01:27:00]  This was right after  This was very timely  When it came out  Yeah, well, you know  You got to take it for what it's worth  It's not like we're playing it as now  This is a little retrospect  This happened  I wrote this one right after  The whole OJ thing started  It's like seven years ago  Before  Yeah, this is like  Good God  Really ancient  And then I started getting my foot in the door  You know, hey, oh  Can I come on the show today?  Alright, yeah, come in Thursday  And then when I was working  I would carry around my pager  For Apollo air conditioning  So they could page me 
[01:27:30]  And find out I was on my jet ski  And not at the job site  And sometimes Opie would page me  So I'd get beeped  And I'd pick it up and go  Oh, man, look at that  Opie's paging me  Opie, B-A-B, people  And I'd make a big scene about it  To the co-workers  I'm going to be on the radio tonight, my friend  No one believed you  But look  I know  Look where we are now  How funny  The funny thing about this song  You guys came up with this song  When everyone was just convinced  That O.J. was so effed 
[01:28:00]  And was probably going to die  Yeah, this was the electric chair  Everyone knew he was guilty  That's what makes this song  Pretty funny nowadays  Knowing what ended up  Happening to O.J.  This is pre-Johnny Cochran  This song came out, though  When people were like  Not only is he effed  This guy's probably going to die  For the crimes he committed  Yeah  This was right after it happened  Wrong again  Yeah  Wrong  Try again, dumbass  Huh?  Before the trial  This is like  Yeah, this is before the trial  This is right after he killed them  Nicole was 
[01:28:30]  Nicole was still warm  When I got this song  Oh, yeah  Have you ever seen  The people that listen to this show?

That was not rehearsed.  It was not rehearsed at all.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. 
[01:41:30]  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Finally they won.  Finally.  Holy S.  Holy S.  Holy S.  You gotta admit one thing.

Yeah, thank you.  Well, I'm laughing.  All right, are we gonna play the game Guess What Surgery Marion Had?  No.  Come on.  No.  No. 
[01:42:00]  I don't want to talk about that.  I have a guess.  You know?  Erectal polyp.  No.  I don't want to talk about that.  That was my guess, Q.  I don't want to talk about it.  What if someone nails it on the phone?  I had it right before Christmas.  I don't want to talk about it.  All right.  Is it...  My Christmas wasn't that good this year.  Is it above the neck?  No.  Is it above the waist?  No?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Now, is it below the knees?  No.  Okay.  It's between the knees and the waist. 
[01:42:30]  You don't want to talk about it.  I will tell you it's off the air.  A little...  Actually, it's all on the air.  I don't want to say.  A little fungus growing on the bush?  No, it's not.  Did you have the gout?  No, it's not.  It was a hemorrhoid.  No.  Not a hemorrhoid?  No.  Okay.  You have hemorrhoids?  No.  I was asking.  No.  Okay.  I'm only kidding.  Come on.  What's the matter with you?  Is it...  It wasn't a hemorrhoid.  Can you ask me a question?  All right.  That gets really mad.  Would it be a question?  I'm just trying to get a quadrant here on your body. 
[01:43:00]  Is it the front of the body or the back of the body?  It's the front.  Front between the hips and the knees.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's try to guess here.  I'm saying it was some type of vaginal wart.  No, no, no, no.  Is it something vaginal?  Nope.  Is it something on your thigh?  Nope.  Wait, it's below the waist and above the knees, but it's not your vag?  Is she lying, lady? 
[01:43:30]  Is it an appendix?  No, no, no.  I had that done already.  She didn't want to talk about it.  That's all.  All right.  It's not your cornhole?  No.  Was it your taint?  No.  No.  Wow.  I'm trying to figure this out.  And it was a praying territory.  You don't have a kid growing out of your thigh, do you?  No, I don't have any.  Conjoined twin.  No, I don't have a kid.  No, I don't have any kid.  No conjoined twin.  No.  Nothing growing out of your thigh, huh?  No.  Hmm.  All right.  Nothing growing.  Come on.  You've got to help us out now.  No. 
[01:44:00]  No, no, no.  No.  Anything with the colon?  No.  Nothing vag, nothing colon.  Nothing.  Give us a hint.  Nothing.  Now everyone is curious.  Was it a growth of some sort?  She's all right.  That's the main thing.  I'm okay.  Well, of course.  I will be, okay.  That's the important thing.  But you have to go under anesthesia.  Oh, good question.  Yes.  All right.  Is it something abdominal?  All right.  Yes.  Abdominal.  It has to do.  No.  It has to do with your intestines.  Yes.  Appendix? 
[01:44:30]  No.  No, no.  No.  A softball size impaction.  Nope.  No.  Kidney stones.  Nope.  No.  Gallbladder.  Nope.  Urethra.  Nope.  You had a penis removed.  No.  No.  No.  No.  We don't sport any wood.  No.  Mom.  Say that again.  And a pap smear.  No.  That's not surgery.  I know.  Come on, Anthony.  You got a girlfriend?  You're married.  I know.  I'm looking at just any option. 
[01:45:00]  Something abdominal, Opie.  It's not vaginal.  So everything down there is either intestine.  It's something with...  I'm actually off the air.  Please.  No, we can't.  No.  Childbirth, Rick.  Tell me my ear.  I won't tell you.  Tell me.  All right.  Off the air.  I'm going to turn off.  Off the air.  I'm going to turn the ear ear.  All right.  Turn the mics off.  Off the air.  Turn the mics off.  We got to go to the music.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  I will tell you when I leave.  All right.  Hold on.  We will be back with the Opie and Anthony show after these words. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Cue the music.  Go to commercial.  All right.  What is that?  I had two cysts on my ovaries.  That's all.  And I had them removed.  All right.  Hold it.  We'll go back.  All right.  Can you play the music?  Please.  All right.  We are back with the Opie and Anthony show already in progress.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, that's all.  I'm glad.  We won't say anything.  We won't.  We won't.  The main thing is that she is fine.  We won't say anything about that on the air.  I don't want the whole world to know.  Obviously.  It was very personal.  You won't hear it from us.  I'm glad you're doing okay, though.  Okay?  All right.  Very nice. 
[01:46:00]  That is the main thing.  All right.  Well, this has been a great visit, girls.  I'm okay.  All right.  What else?  What else are we going to talk about?  Come on, Diane.  You can stay.  I want to talk to them.  I want to go see them.  Yes.  Come on.  We've got to go see them.  You obviously dressed up for Anthony today.  I dress.  I just dress up.  I just dress up every once in a while.  You've got that hot pink shirt on.  You've got the leather pants.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  What are you working on there?  She just went out and brought these the other day.  Lady Di.  These are brand new.  Lady Di.  These are brand new.  Are those real leather? 
[01:46:30]  Those are real leather.  Yes, they are.  Those are brand new.  She got it at the leather warehouse.  You just went to Copperfield.  Did you see that?  He leaned over.  I've been divorced two years now.  They are brand new.  Lady Di, let's see your butt in those leather pants.  She almost got bad to me.  Let's take a look at your butt in those leather pants.  She did.  Since the last time, you guys.  Lady Di.  Is anybody going to go home?  Lady Di.  Look at that, Anthony.  Lady Di.  What possessed you to buy leather pants?  I've got to ask you that.  I felt like buying leather pants.  You felt like buying leather pants.  I feel like buying leather pants.  She goes through these stages every couple months. 
[01:47:00]  Every so often.  She goes through these stages.  I like getting dressed up.  You go through stages every so often.  Do you have some hot lingerie on underneath there?  Yeah, I do.  As a matter of fact, we all go through stages.  Come on.  Let's take a peek at your lingerie.  No, that's all right.  That's okay.  Just a peek.  No, no.  Come on, Di.  No, that's okay.  Where did you go for your lingerie?  A little Victoria's Secret?  I had the lingerie.  You had the lingerie?  And it came from Vicky's or...  Victoria's Secret. 
[01:47:30]  Victoria's Secret, yeah.  Oh, let's take a little look.  She lost, guys.  Did you buy it yourself?  Hey, guys.  She lost since...  Lost weight.  She did.  I did.  I lost a little bit of weight.  Me, I gained a little.  Not that much.  But now I'm going back.  Now I'm going back to losing.  In my pinky.  Lady Di.  In my pinky right here.  What you're supposed to do...  And I gained.  I gained six pounds.  ...is stick your fist in her mouth for a second.  What?  What you're supposed to do...  No, what you're supposed to do...  Because she doesn't know what to say to you guys.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  I go, I go, I go, I go.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, this is your visit.  You brought your friend, and you haven't even talked.  I know, thanks. 
[01:48:00]  Talking?  All right, now go ahead.  Talk.  I'll be quiet.  Okay.  That's funny, Rick.  Rico's Lingerie by John Deere.  The Giants being in the Super Bowl, huh?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  What do you guys think about that?  I think so.  Of what?  The Giants being in the Super Bowl.  I haven't gotten off of the leather pants thing yet.  I am a Jets fan.  I had a comment to make, but it's just impossible to weave a word in edgewise.  I'm happy that the Giants are in the Super Bowl.  You are happy about that?  Good.  I'm happy for that.  Sure.  Happy for the Giants fans?  At least it's the New York team.  Sure.  I want to ask you guys a question.  We're at the Limo A and Stalker P show, and you really want it. 
[01:48:30]  Are you guys going to Tampa?  I don't know.  I'm thinking we give them 15 minutes, Anthony.  Are you guys going to Tampa down for the Super Bowl?  We're not really sure at this point.  Yeah, Marion.  We might.  Could be her.  He's mine.  We might be going.  If we don't, I think we're going to throw a huge Super Bowl party up here, like we did  last year.  Can we invite her?  No, you're not invited at this point.  Whatever happened to a double date?  Yeah, that's right, Opie.  I'm supposed to go on a date with you.  I don't know about that.  Got a little too real.  I heard the show.  I heard the show that day. 
[01:49:00]  Come on.  I just got home from work, and she called you.  We bailed out of the double date because we learned that you guys weren't going to give  us any action.  What?  We had you on the phone, Marion.  You said you wouldn't, you know, hob the knob.  Well, the only action you're going to be seeing is me running as quickly as I can.  No.  No action.  My husband was in the other room listening to this show.  So there's no action, so why should we go on a date?  He's in the other room cracking up.  So I couldn't talk and look at him at the same time.  So if you weren't married, we'd get some action going on our double date?  Yeah, where do you want to go? 
[01:49:30]  Huh?  Where do you want to go?  Like to a drive-in, so we could get some of that making out in.  There's no driving humor.  Oh.  Even she knows there's no drive-ins anymore.  There you go.  Well, there hasn't been any drive-ins in like 10 years.  Come on.  Can we play What's in Marion's Mouth?  Yeah.  Hey, at least I'm talking.  Well, you're talking too.  At least.  I'm talking too.  Yeah, well.  But I'm listening to what they're saying.  I'm talking too.  So am I.  I could do both.  Lady Di.  Yes.  All right.  What we're going to do, we're going to let you guys leave the studio, and you can come 
[01:50:00]  back in after break.  But you've got to say something to Anthony.  This was your little day.  Okay.  You took off from work and everything.  You're like, oh, Anthony.  You're like, all right.  I'll do that.  Marion?  I want to...  Marion?  What?  Your doctor just checked in and told us what the surgery was.  What doctor?  It seems you were pregnant, and at the fetus's request, it wanted to be removed from your  womb.  No, I was not pregnant.  Is that true?  Okay.  All right.  Well, that's fake then.  Are you pregnant?  That was coming up on the instant feedback.  Look at her. 
[01:50:30]  She gets old.  I didn't think that to Anthony.  Oh, come on.  Oh, Diane, be quiet.  Why should we go outside?  Don't be friendly.  You're cracking up.  Security.  Security.  The studio.  Hey, Dix, it's hilarious that I'm saying that.  I love that with the wow stickers all over.  You know that bit?  That was awesome.  It's funny that I'm saying that.  You think it's funny.  It's hilarious.  Marion, every word out of your mouth is hysterically funny.  Believe me.  Very funny.  All right, listen.  I mean, it's because you love the guy, Diane.  Come on.  Do you?  Oh, well. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Defend yourself now.  Go ahead.  Why?  You love, you don't love Anthony.  No, no.  Well, yeah.  I like Opie, but not in that way.  Okay.  In that way.  Not in that way.  What is this way?  That'd be a dream come true.  Who are you kidding?  All right.  Well, thanks for the gift.  No, no.  They're coming back in.  We're giving Lady Di a chance to get herself together.  Okay.  Okay.  She came all this way.  And look, she's got a little makeup on.  She's got a lingerie underneath. 
[01:51:30]  She's got leather pants on.  Lady Di, before you go out and buy the leather pants, I got to be honest with you.  Usually leather pants, if a girl wears them.  Right.  Like she's got that supermodel figure.  Right?  Okay.  Right.  Or if somebody else that doesn't have the supermodel figure buys leather pants, they  buy them real small as an incentive to get into the shape that is best to fit  in leather pants.  Now, I'm really trying to weave my way around here.  I thought I looked good in them. 
[01:52:00]  I'm weaving, weaving.  Weaving the way you're around, right?  It's, it's, I got to say.  Get to the point.  Come on, Ann.  Say what you're going to say.  I'm saying that the leather pants are not very flattering.  Oh, my God.  Now, you got to, I'm being honest.  Holy, I got to be honest with you.  I'm doing my best, you know?  I understand.  I appreciate the fact that you do try your best.  Okay.  But the thing is, when you get the leather pants, it's...  I thought they looked pretty good. 
[01:52:30]  Let me, let me take a look, Lady Di.  Yeah, go over, show Opie.  Go show Opie.  Let me take a look here.  Poor cow.  Poor cow gave his life.  Gave his life for that.  Not bad.  Look at you.  So, are you guys going to be a carol, I mean, at, um...  Could have made some catcher's mitts out of that, but no.  Are you guys going to be a rascal next month?  Get her looking hot in her leather pants.  Are you guys going to be a rascal when Emily's played in Jim Norton?  Yeah, you look good.  What?  Are you guys going to be at rascal's? 
[01:53:00]  Sure, sure, we'll be at rascal's.  I'll be there.  She's gone.  I'll be there with my friend Emily and my dad.  Emily, can we bring her up here next time?  Emily.  Emily.  What are we going to call you if there's three?  She's a real nice...  The retarded golden girls.  No, no.  No, the retarded...  Golden girls?  I'm trying to think of three girls.  She's a little younger than what we are.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Can we...  I need a peek of the lingerie now that I saw the hot leather pants.  No, no, no.  Just a peek.  You know how the girls pull up the little, you know, the panties a little... 
[01:53:30]  Let me see.  What?  Her lingerie?  Sure.  A little peek.  You're not wearing anything fishnet from Bob's Bait and Tackle, are you?  Hey, she's the one that lost the weight.  I'm the one that gained the weight.  What do you got there?  Some black panties.  Some black panties.  That she just pulled out out of the top of the leather pants.  I'm going to guess a thong, Lady Di?  A little thong action?  It might be.  Opie?  What?  Some things are just best left to the imagination.  I mean, we hear...  We hear Parker Patty.  She seems really nice.  Is she a nice person?  You guys would get along perfectly. 
[01:54:00]  Will we get along great with her?  She seems like she's like one of us.  And we hear her on the air.  We got a whole list of names that you guys...  She does.  She seems like she's one of us.  I heard the show the other day.  Lady Di, are we going to...  Starts it a show.  What are you looking to see, Opie?  I'm looking to see a little flash from Lady Di.  Oh, no.  She just pulled those panties out of there.  They don't want you to flash.  They don't want me to flash.  What else are you expecting?  A Louisiana license plate and a Kittner boy?  Come on.  Come on.  With that prison visit or what?  Is that what you want?  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Push them up against the...  Now, what's going on in Mississippi?  How come...  We're going to check in with Stinky as soon as we get you guys off the air.  They've made it into Pennsylvania.  All right.  As soon as that camera's turned around.  Oh, my God.  I'm just a saying you guys.  All right.  Turn the camera around because Lady Di doesn't want her hot boobs all over the Internet.  Over here.  Okay.  All right.  I swear.  All right.  You're off.  She don't want the camera...  I don't want the camera on.  All right.  You don't want the camera on.  You're going to push them up against the glass so they look nice and firm and stuff?  Yeah.  Okay.  Here we go.  Prison visit from Lady Di.  She's outside the studio pushing her...  I'm getting scared.  Oh, my God. 
[01:55:00]  The prison visit.  Her boobs up against the glass.  Oh, my God.  I have never seen anything like that in my life.  Ever.  All right.  All right.  You've never seen anything like that in your life?  Not like that.  That's...  That's something.  The prison visit.  That's the prison visit.  All right.  A la cable guy.  All right.  Listen.  Why don't you guys take a break?  Get a cup of coffee or something.  Okay.  Very good.  I want Lady Di to get her thoughts together and talk to Anthony on the air a few more minutes  before you guys will be escrowing from the building.  Oh, my God.  She's got to start talking more. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, of course she does.  Right.  All right, guys.  I got to talk as much as her.  Yeah, all right.  She talks a lot more than me, but she's still on a nervous wreck.  I don't know why I've been meeting you guys, what, four times already?  Yeah.  You're so nervous.  We're no treat, right?  A lot of times I met him.  You're the one that's nervous.  I don't know why I am.  I'm fine.  You're fine?  It's like a vaudeville show on acid, these two.  You're like a vaudeville show on acid.  I think we can do our own radio show eventually.  Yeah, I think we're going to give you a 15-minute radio show in the near future. 
[01:56:00]  We are going to give them a 15-minute radio show in the near future.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  We would like that.  Like Limo A, Stalker P show.  We could have the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  You know why?  We could have the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  All right.  When they come and visit, and they look at us, and they laugh because they don't believe us.  We'll be trying to get a word in.  When's the next time you guys are going to be in town where you can come and see us?  We can come any time.  I'm going to be off for work.  My birthday is February 11th, so maybe we'll be there around that time.  Nothing else to do on your birthday?  My birthday is in April.  My birthday is on a Sunday.  My birthday is on a Sunday.  Yeah, great. 
[01:56:30]  So February 9th, I might be off for work, and we'll come up on the 12th, which is a holiday.  Can we have you guys back later this week to have a 15-minute retarded Laverne and Shirley radio show?  No, I've got to work the rest of the week.  We might have to do it today.  We might have to do it today, Anthony.  I've got to go back to work tomorrow.  All right, why don't you guys get out of our studio and...  Oh, no.  Thank you.  Get out of your studio.  Thanks.  And we'll figure out what we want to do with you next, okay?  I'm thinking maybe a 15-minute radio show.  I'm thinking.  Okay, just let us know.  Yeah, because we can't come back this week.  We've got to go back to work tomorrow. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, go out and do some show prep just in case.  Yeah, why don't you talk about...  Get your thoughts together about something, stories maybe going on in the news that you want to talk about on your own radio show.  Right, okay.  And we'll see how that works, and we'll bring you in, and you take over the airwaves for 15 minutes.  Yes, the Rangers.  Okay.  All right.  You can talk sports.  You can talk lifestyle issues.  The Mets tickets go on sale in two more weeks.  What?  It's a full season.  What happened?  The Mets tickets go on sale in two more weeks.  The Mets tickets go on sale in about two weeks.  Okay.  The Mets tickets go on sale in about two weeks.  Okay.  So pretty soon, it's a full season.  All right, listen, listen.  Yes. 
[01:57:30]  Ben or Rick, give them a piece of paper and a pen so you guys can jot down some things you want to talk about, all right?  A lot of people commenting on if they bring in the third person, it would have to be the retarded Charlie's Angels.  All right, call Emily.  Call Emily up.  We're going to call her up.  We're going to call her up.  We're going to call the show.  All right.  Emily, if you're listening, hi.  Yeah, Emily, if you're listening, call the show.  Call the show.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Why don't you guys leave for a little while?  Okay.  Angels.  Hello, Angels.  Your mission today, please jump out an effing window. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh.  I enjoy the hell out of it when they come out because there's something that's so bizarre about those two.  I think they're amazing.  I really think they're aliens.  There's something very bizarre that they're serious about it, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You see that?  Like, Marion will say something because I just bashed Marion and then Marion comes back at me with something.  Yeah.  And Lady Di gets all pissed off.  You know what you're going to do because it is priceless?  Wow.  You got to attack Marion.  Yeah.  So Lady Di gets pissed when Marion attacks me back.  Because it's hilarious. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, don't say that about me, Anthony.  You can hear it all in the background.  I know.  Holy Jesus.  Stinky, if you're...  They're probably out of listening range at this point.  I believe they are in Pennsylvania already.  All right.  Stinky and Earl on their way to Mississippi.  We'll give them a call and check in with them next, okay?  They've been on the road for like two hours already, Anthony.  All right.  We'll be back.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  1-0-8-7-W-N-E-W.  Our buddy, our pal, Q, who's in studio today, Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  Still one of my faves.  I'm horny for little girls.  He brought in a brand new song about the road trip that Earl and Stinky are taking.  We played it earlier.  We'll play it again before we get out of here today.  Also on the way...  You can do it!  You know that WNW is looking for new radio shows.  Yes.  Last week we tried out the Stalker Patty Limo A show.  Right.  That worked out very well.  I think they're going to be picking up overnight. 
[01:59:30]  You never know.  Yeah.  Later today...  Oh.  It's the retarded Laverne and Shirley show for 15 minutes.  They're out there now show prepping.  Yes, they are.  Is that what I'm hearing?  Do you hear any rumblings out there of what the show might be about?  Um...  I think they're shooting for a sports theme.  Shooting for a sports theme.  Very smart.  I see a lot of stuff written down about the Giants.  Sports retards!  Exactly.  Sports retards!  Morning.  Well, you know, the local team's doing very well, so that's very smart. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, sure.  Hop on the Giants bandwagon thing.  Sure.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley talking about sports and other things.  Very good.  If you turn off your radio now, you're insane.  No, no.  If you don't, you will be.  Yeah, that's true, too.  All right, let's check in with Stinky as they make their way to Winona, Mississippi.  Winona.  In that suburban.  Stinky!  Hey, guys.  Where are you, man?  We just made it to Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  About 20 miles in.  The third state of your road trip. 
[02:00:30]  Yes.  It's so foggy, you can't even see the car in front of you.  Uh-oh.  But it's good, you know.  No cops can see us, though.  How fast are you going, Stink?  122 kilometers.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  No, no, no.  Yeah, we don't understand.  We don't know how far we've gone, you know, because it's all kilometers.  We have no conversion.  Well, you're in your third state, though.  Yeah, it's nice.  Anything going on that you need to report at this point in time?  Uh, nothing, really. 
[02:01:00]  No tempers have flared up or anything.  We're still, you know, assimilating to each other.  He's got cranky ass.  Uh, Scott just said he has cranky ass.  Scott, the driver, has cranky ass.  That's good.  Sure.  Yeah.  Uh, has Earl waken from his, uh, neck?  Yeah.  His slumber is over.  All right.  Is he, uh, is he becoming a little more lively, or?  Is he what?  Is he becoming a lot lively?  Yeah, he started talking about the old N.E.W. days and about the Super Bowl and stuff.  Yeah, it's all, Dan got it all on the tape. 
[02:01:30]  He saw the mic come out and he started talking great about CBS, but before the mic came on,  he was bashing it.  No, that is not true.  Have you guys, say there are you, no, that's not true.  I'm ready.  You guys think, you guys think.  He was bad-mouthing Mel and everything.  Oh, good.  Nothing's bad about Mel.  I forgot about those road trips, Ant.  Yeah.  Where you really start talking about a lot of stuff you would normally not talk about.  They just all get going.  So.  All right.  I can't, I can't wait until we really get some brawls. 
[02:02:00]  That's what I want to hear.  Yeah, it'll happen.  So once the night comes, usually.  Earl?  I mean, I was thinking, uh, you guys are taking enough pictures and stuff, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Earl's not really working the camera.  I got the video camera going.  All right.  Hey, Stinky, a lot of people want to know if you've eaten the calzone yet, if you know  what I mean.  Uh, no, we haven't.  You have not eaten the calzone.  Amazingly, no.  Okay.  A lot of people want, very curious about that.  I'm looking to eat the calzone pretty soon.  Hey, are you guys out of the listening area? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah, way out of the area.  But somehow, five miles back, some guy drove up with an O&A rule sign.  He was giving us a thumbs up.  Nice.  That's pretty cool.  Uh, you're so lucky you're out of range, because in a little while, we're having the  retarded Laverne and Shirley radio show.  Oh, God, it sounds worse than the Stalker P and Limo A show.  Yeah, that was bad.  This is going to be even worse, Stinky.  All right, let's keep talking.  Let's, uh, let's talk to Earl real fast.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Earl. 
[02:03:00]  Well.  How you doing?  Good.  How are things going now?  Any conflicts already?  How many of you are?  Oh, none at all.  It's been pretty harmonious so far, but we've still got a little bit to go.  Of course you do.  I think once the nighttime hits, things will kind of change a little bit.  We can't see anything.  It's so foggy out here.  We heard you were dozing.  You were sleeping a little bit.  I took a little cat nap, yes.  I have always said that I am the worst passenger driver.  Why?  I sleep.  I don't say anything.  He's knocking down those stereotypes. 
[02:03:30]  That's what we like about Earl.  Oh.  God, Earl.  Stay awake.  Enjoy the ride.  You can't even see anything around you.  It's all fog.  Are you guys going to be driving throughout the night?  Oh, you're going to go well into the night, yes.  I would think, yeah.  Just keep going.  Just keep it nonstop.  I'm kind of bummed Ron and Fezz are off today.  Yeah, we could check on them, like, when they're starting to get a little woozy.  Loopy.  Yeah.  Loopy.  All right.  All right, Earl.  Well, I think, I mean, we got some corn blare in here. 
[02:04:00]  We're having a good time.  Cool.  Corn, part of the Black Rock Coalition.  No.  By the way, 122 kilometers, that means they're going 72 miles per hour.  There you go.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  All right, Earl.  All right, guys.  We'll check it in a bit.  Sounds good.  Cool.  There they go.  Earl and Stinky.  Oh, no.  Earl.  Yeah.  I want to talk to Dan from Hoboken real fast.  Yeah, hold on.  All right.  What's up, guys?  Dan.  Hey, what's going on? 
[02:04:30]  You got to give us the real scoop.  What the hell's going on?  I'm a little scared, frankly.  Really?  Yeah.  It's getting ugly?  It's actually pretty much how I said.  You got a lame joke guy driving.  And then Stinky laughs at everything, which is cool.  That's because he's ready to eat that calzana, if you know what I mean.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean, we did the 420 thing.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to smoke a little.  Hey, Dan, what's your impression of Earl so far? 
[02:05:00]  In between his bad-mouthing CBS and you guys, he's okay.  Yeah.  See, Dan will tell us this story.  Of course.  Have you written anything down, Dan?  Yeah, I got a lot.  I'm going to do a minute-by-minute journal.  All right.  Are you writing down what did we learn and stuff?  Yeah, I can do some of those.  All right, cool.  All right, Dan.  We'll check in with you guys soon.  Okay, cool.  There he goes.  Dan from Hoboken.  On the trip down to Mississippi.  He's documenting everything for us.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  The wonderful, wonderful Winona, Mississippi.  There is such nothing down there.  A lot of people checking in about the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  No, I don't have them.  All right, I'll get them in a little while.  They're all mixed up with the bad instant feedbacks.  You want to take a break and we'll try to call Reagan?  Yeah, let's do that.  And then in a little while, we'll have the retarded Laverne and Shirley radio show.  Come in and do their own little radio show.  Hey, girls, come in here for a sec. 
[02:06:00]  See if they're ready.  Just want to see where they're at with their show prep.  Oh, they're just talking and talking.  Who carries pocketbooks these days?  I'm trying to call her, our father's girlfriend.  I need my pocketbook.  What's in that pocketbook of yours, Marion?  Nothing.  Why?  Why?  It's like a suitcase.  Why?  Okay.  All right.  I carry it with me everywhere I go. 
[02:06:30]  You guys, we have decided to give you your own radio show for 15 minutes today.  Where you guys will have to run the whole show.  Aunt and I are just standing by, just watching.  Okay.  All right.  Sure.  Are you show prepping?  Are you getting a radio show together?  Trying to.  Trying to.  Rumor has it's going to have like a sports theme because you both are into sports.  Sort of, yeah.  Sort of.  Well, there are plenty of other topics, too.  There's other stuff.  We're going to talk about Ronald Reagan, hip surgery.  Very good.  You know.  Hopefully, he's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to talk about Martin Luther King?  Very, very big day?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, well, they had a parade, I guess, here.  I don't know where.  They had one in Newark, too, over the weekend.  Yeah.  I guess.  Okay.  Anything else to look forward to?  Can we play any games?  Let's see.  Let's see.  The Rangers won last night.  Right.  Right.  Four to two.  Well, you can touch on this during your show.  We just want to know other subjects that you might hit on.  You got sports.  You got Reagan.  We hope Stinky and Narelle are having a good time in Mississippi.  Nice.  Hope they don't get into trouble.  Whatever.  Huh?  Okay.  Hopefully, they have a good time.  All right.  A lot of people counting on this radio show.  David Wells.  David Wells got traded. 
[02:07:30]  Here we go.  White Sox?  White Sox.  White Sox or White Sox?  White Sox.  Okay.  We were at the game last night, so we don't know.  We don't know much.  Right.  We didn't know much about that.  Okay.  All right.  Concentrating on the Ranger game.  We're looking forward to it.  You guys are going to be on the air in about a half hour, so keep getting ready, okay?  For about a half hour?  No, you're going to be on in a half hour.  In a half hour, yeah.  We don't want to be that long, because we're running out of things to say.  I doubt that.  Very long.  Yeah.  Keep on looking at the paper.  We'll find things to say.  We'll think of things to say.  Okay.  At least for me, I will. 
[02:08:00]  At least for I to.  Right.  All right.  She's writing them down, so.  Okay.  Very good.  I'm trying to get you.  Okay.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  Well, yeah, but I can't.  Come on.  Let's isolate that.  Okay.  All right.  Come on.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  Wait, Marion, can you say that again?  Yeah.  I got kind of a sort of brain.  I mean, I'm trying to do good things to say.  Kind of a sort of and sort of a kind of.  All right.  We got tomorrow's promo.  Yeah.  Use that line in our freaking promo, please.  All right, ladies, can you leave and continue your radio show prep? 
[02:08:30]  Get your show prepping going for your show, because we have to call Reagan in the hospital.  Really?  You guys do?  Yeah.  We wish him well.  Yes.  Yes.  You didn't know.  Marion, come back here.  What?  Lady Di, we'll see you in a minute.  You didn't know that we know.  Get on mic.  Don't come near me.  What?  Hey.  You didn't know that.  I don't bite.  You didn't know that we're friends with the former president?  No.  Yeah.  No.  Well, we wish you.  I wish him well, at least.  Hopefully, he'll be all right.  So, please, no jokes about the president. 
[02:09:00]  No, I know.  Okay.  Because Anthony and I go way back with his family.  Oh, okay.  Good.  I call him Ronnie.  Good.  You really didn't know that, though?  No.  Oh.  Okay.  I didn't.  Wow.  We're just going to call him to make sure he's doing okay.  All right.  I wish him well.  All right.  Any messages from you two?  Yeah, maybe.  We wish him to get better.  It's not every day you get to talk to a former president.  No.  Yeah.  Maybe you could talk to him.  Ask him a couple of questions, maybe.  Like what?  I don't know.  All right.  We'll see you guys in a little bit. 
[02:09:30]  We wish him well.  That's all.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Stay tuned for the Retard of Laverne Shirley radio show.  Right around 530, Anthony.  Okay?  But next, we catch up with the former president in the hospital.  See how his hip's doing.  Okay?  Yes.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Ronald Reagan on the phone, Anthony.  We'll talk to him in a minute or two.  I see that.  See how he's doing after his hip surgery?  Yeah.  His hip was repaired. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  The ball that's connected to your femur, your thigh bone, that fits in the socket in your hip,  just snapped off.  Oh, God.  Oh, hello.  Hello.  All of a sudden, you must just get, like, really short on that side as the femur bone  just has nothing to hang on to and goes up your leg as you tip over and fall to the floor. 
[02:10:30]  Thank God he's not going to remember the pain.  Yeah.  I guess.  Maybe Alzheimer's works that way, too.  So he's on hold.  Yeah.  He could hang for a few minutes.  Well, he's got nothing to do.  The retired Laverne and Shirley getting ready for their 15-minute radio show as we try  to get new radio shows on WNEW.  We're helping.  We're team players.  Look at us.  It's the second show we're auditioning for a slot here at NEW.  How lazy are we?  Nicole, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi, Nicole.  Hi.  I love you guys. 
[02:11:00]  You guys, I've been listening to you for a couple years now.  Thank you, Nicole.  But you cannot put retired Laverne and Shirley on the phone.  Why?  Why not?  Oh, my God.  I can't listen.  I can't stand to listen to them.  They're hideous.  They're getting organized, though.  Maybe they won't talk at the same time for 15 straight minutes.  Maybe they won't.  Hopefully they won't talk at all.  What other radio show has the balls to put, like, two retarded people on during primetime again?  During primetime.  Nobody but you guys.  Nobody but you guys.  On the hugely rated Opie and Anthony show.  All right, Nicole. 
[02:11:30]  Thanks, guys.  Stay tuned for the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  Love you, guys.  I think it's going to be a hit, Anthony.  I think so.  A lot of instant feedback coming in about Lady Di and Mary and Pete from Queens.  Those two broads are so ugly, it looks like they did a 100-yard dash in a 90-yard gym.  Don from East Meadow.  Guys, what have we, the listeners, done to deserve the mess of women you have brought on this show the last two weeks?  You can't even put teen in front of these animals.  Wow. 
[02:12:00]  Lady Di is pointing her finger at me as we read these on the air, Anthony.  Paul from New York.  Listeners.  These two broads sound like two old ladies getting ready to go to a bingo game.  Adam from Manhattan.  Di and Mary are like a woman's period.  They come once a month and put us in a bad mood for all the days surrounding their visit.  Very good.  See, we don't need Dan from Hoboken.  Kate from Jersey.  Can you ask Marion to say she sells seashells by the seashells?  You stop it, Buddy Hinton. 
[02:12:30]  We'll do that.  So what do you want to do?  I mean, we got Reagan on hold.  We got, well, the Retard of the Burn and Shirley radio shows at 530.  We all know that.  But your brother.  Yeah.  We got a hold of his song.  And I think we have to play this right now.  Yeah, Joe and Jabil, I guess, Cowbell Bill helping out also.  Yeah, this is maybe in his studio.  The songs are starting to come in about Stinky and Black Earl's trip to Mississippi.  To Mississippi. 
[02:13:00]  And this one, yeah, Brother Joe.  We played one earlier from Q, who's still in the studio.  We're going to play his song again before we get out of here.  Yeah.  But let's roll right into your brother's song here.  All right.  It says it all about their little trip down Winona, Mississippi.  Why don't?  The boys are in Pennsylvania, by the way, if you're just checking in, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Well, I hope you and Anthony was sitting and thinking about sending old Stinky on a radio mission.  Go down south and check out W-O-N-A.  The boys decided to have some fun, so they got handphones and ride shotguns. 
[02:13:30]  Y'all might know them better as Black Earl.  When they left New York, everything was fine.  Until they crossed that Mason-Dixon line.  That's when Black Earl's face turned snowy white.  Three hits in a truck with guns and beer.  Says, check out the nigger and the skinny little queer.  I bet we've been railing like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  The good old boys, they put on their sheets. 
[02:14:00]  And Earl's eyes popped out like bug weeks from some old Little Rascal's episode.  Earl said, Stinky, those boys want to F us.  Sure do wish we had Opie's Lexus.  Not this piece of crap that got us from Rent-A-Rick.  Old Stinky figured better hit the gas.  He noticed the smell from Black Earl's pants.  Lord and Lord, the dude done crap himself.  The hicks was gaining on him and looking meaner. 
[02:14:30]  Earl was making faces like Farina from that haunted house Little Rascal's episode.  Just about then, three tires popped.  They blew a rod and the car done stopped.  They took out the KY and started moving up.  Well, the truck was on him like flies on crap.  Earl tried pulling out some gangster rap.  Bubba said, my granny sounds blacker than you. 
[02:15:00]  Well, they held Earl down and took off his pants.  And that's when they noticed that cranky ass.  As Bubba jumped up and puked on Stinky's shoes.  Well, Stinky said, boys, now I've had enough.  He rolled up a joint and he took a puff.  Passed it off to Bubba and said, how about you?  Well, Bubba took a tope off of Stinky's blood.  Where'd you learn to roll like that, you skinny run?  You twist him up just like my cousin Clam. 
[02:15:30]  Well, Stinky said, Clam's my cousin too.  And if you know what's good for you, you'll leave my leather cheerio alone.  Well, I'm your wife's sister's husband's brother's cousin-in-law.  And you're her husband's brother's sister's mother's cousin-in-law.  So I guess I can call you Dad.  Well, Bubba said, boys, better give it a rest.  If I bang that boy, it'd be incest.  And old Stimey's still got a stinking ass.  So next time O and A tell us to drive, we'll say F you. 
[02:16:00]  I think we'll fly to Mississippi via aeroplane.  Yee-haw!  Woo-hoo!  Wow, that's a good one, Joe.  God damn.  That's a nice little ditty from Anthony's brother Joe and Cowbell Bill.  A lot of instant feedback's coming, and they're loving it.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Props to Joe, funny as hell. 
[02:16:30]  This song rocks.  Ants Bro's songs are great.  Wow, look at that.  Yee-haw, Wrangler and Diamond Dust.  I'm going to go rent me some horses and plow me a Dreamweaver.  That's a good song.  We're going to have to get that on a few times this week.  That's a good old good'un.  Joey!  Hey, Joey!  Hello.  Hello.  We have you on the air, Joey.  Joey.  Who are you?  This is Jerry.  All right, Jerry.  Jerry, Scott's brother, who's driving your truck?  Down in Mississippi. 
[02:17:00]  What's up?  Down in Winona.  What's up, Jerry?  How's it going, guys?  We're having fun.  You guys are the best, man.  Your show is great.  I love you guys.  Heard nothing but good things.  Thank you.  What are you guys doing out in Winona?  We're just going to fool around a little bit.  You going to go rouse the rednecks?  I don't know what they got planned for the gang when they get there.  Yeah, how long are they going for?  Just a couple days.  Yeah, a couple days, good.  They should be back in New York Thursday afternoon.  All right.  I just want to give a shout-out to my brother and all your crews going down there from Jay  over at the Grand Saloon in Clifton.  All right.  You guys are the best.  We listen to your show all day in the restaurant and in the kitchen. 
[02:17:30]  It keeps my staff going.  Hey, thank you, Jerry.  You guys are the best.  We appreciate it.  God bless.  And tell him my brother, have a safe trip.  We will.  Next time we talk to him.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Scott, of course, is driving the Suburban.  That's his brother Jerry checking in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  A lot of people say that's the funniest song Joe has done.  That's a great one, man.  Hey, Ray, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  All right.  And your brother's got some talent, man.  Yes, he does.  That was a killer tune.  That's a good one, didn't it?  A choice tune.  Didn't it, like, give you a whole story, like you were picturing it in your head and stuff? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, it was great.  That was a great job.  I've heard since I've been listening to you guys.  Very good, man.  All right, fellas, have a good one.  Thank you, Ray.  Later.  Rodney brings up a good point here.  Rodney?  Rodney?  Hey, yo, dude.  Dude, hello.  Whatever your name is.  He wants to know when it's going to be on Napster.  Rodney, the guy's like, no, my name's like Jim.  Someone will put that up on Napster.  Oh, that'll end up on Napster.  Are you kidding?  Put it under Opie and Anthony, but make sure, you know, Joe gets the credit when you, you know,  put the title of the song and stuff.  You pop it home. 
[02:18:30]  But that's the easiest way to find some of this stuff from our show.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Pop Opie and Anthony in and then hopefully that'll be up there soon, okay?  Well, Anthony, we want to talk to Reagan, but I think we have to step aside for the retarded  Laverne and Shirley show.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  We told them we'd give them airtime at 530.  Look what time it is.  I know.  We got to take a break and come back with their radio show.  Then we'll get to the Reagan thing.  Yes.  We'll get to a great Mike Tyson story from over the weekend.  Mike in the news again.  And we got to get Q's song about Earl and Stinky on the radio again as well. 
[02:19:00]  So we got lots to do today.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back with the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  If you touch that dial, you're insane.  So you went pumpkin picking with Sandy.  You drove all the way back with your booty of pumpkin.  Well, that sounds fun.  No?  That's a fun day.  No!  Who is the man who goes medieval on your ass?  Damn right.  Who is the guy who's pumpkin picking on the slide? 
[02:19:30]  Can you dig it?  Who is the dude who's stiff you on the check for phone?  Diamond does.  You can call him mister.  He's banging the producer's sister.  Oh, me!  We're doing Reach Around.  Bugle-a-goo, bugle-a-goo, bugle-a-goo, bugle-a-goo, bugle-a-goo, bugle-a-goo. 踏踢.  And Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, the 48-hour Hollywood Diet.  By the way, a lot of reviews coming in for Joe's song.  Yeah, people saying his best hit since Oh Mein Fuhrer,  which he did for the Most Offensive Song Contest.  But some people are saying that still his best song is Dry, Dry, Dry, Vag.  Yeah.  We can't play that on the radio anymore.  I wonder if we got to get all those songs up on Napster or something so people could really enjoy them. 
[02:20:30]  Because Joe has some hilarious songs that never made the radio.  What about the Dry, Dry, Dry, my, my, my.  That's a great one.  Short and sweet.  What about Homo No. 3 or whatever?  Homo No. 1.  Homo No. 1 is a hilarious song.  We put it on the radio once and they dumped it out of the entire show.  A little bit of man meat.  We got to get all those up on Napster.  Some hilarious stuff that just never made the radio. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Anyway, the 48-hour Hollywood diet.  Yeah, you know how the Hollywood stars lose their weight?  Just like this.  You're tired of being fat.  You want to lose your thick thighs, your big ass, your overgrown gut.  That's right.  Use the Hollywood Miracle Diet.  The 48-hour Hollywood Miracle Diet.  It's the product of the decade, they're saying.  Now, if the decade's only one year old, is that really saying much?  I would say the product of the century.  Nice.  Why it works.  Yeah, many people report clearer skin, more energy, even a better sex life. 
[02:21:30]  Not only losing weight.  Drop a pant size, lose your love handles.  In two days, you'll look and feel better and lose up to ten pounds.  Here's what you do.  You call 1-800-NEW-DIET.  1-800-NEW-DIET.  The 48-hour Miracle Hollywood Diet.  Or Hollywood Miracle Diet.  However you want to say it.  It allows you to cleanse, detox, and rejuvenate your body while you shed up to ten pounds.  Join the diet revolution that's thinning America two days at a time.  And a lot of people have used this.  Millions of people use the all-natural doctor-tested miracle to lose weight and keep it off. 
[02:22:00]  Ten pounds, two days, the healthy way.  Call 1-800-NEW-DIET.  Ask about their free product offer, 1-800-NEW-DIET.  Just a couple minutes away from the retardant, the Vernon Shirley radio show.  Yeah, kill yourself.  Stay there.  It's come with you, N-E-W.  Well, if I were to turn gay, I'd want to date to anyone.  Waddle doodle.  Go ahead, put that shit on the air, man.  I don't care.  O.B. and Anthony.  It's the O&A Show, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[02:22:30]  We've got to get the phones lit up for the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley coming in, doing 15 minutes on primetime radio here.  That's right.  In our never-ending quest for new shows for WNEW.  I have no idea what they're doing tonight, by the way, because you and I have decided to go back to normal programming as far as the O&A Show goes.  Yeah, we were team players for a week, and now WNEW is going to have to come up with their own shows. 
[02:23:00]  That's why we like to have these tryouts, because you never know.  Something might hit.  Something might pop, right?  We're a little different off the air than we are on the air, Opie, right?  Yeah, I think so.  So maybe the retarded Laverne and Shirley are different on the air.  We've had them on the air.  I mean, if this is their own show now.  They could come on and be great.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they've been show-prepping.  And I could turn this lead to gold.  I know.  They've been show-prepping alchemists. 
[02:23:30]  On instant feedback, Anthony from West Orange.  Yeah.  I learned that the retarded Laverne and Shirley do more show-prepping one day than you guys have done in two and a half years.  Hey, you're going to ruin it for us.  You got that right.  Cue in the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  He has a little intro for the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  Oh, really?  Very small.  Do you need the music to go along with it, do you think?  I think it's just that thing, the tag at the top.  The beginning?  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  All right, here we go.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  They're fat. 
[02:24:00]  They're ugly.  They're nauseating.  And they won't shut up.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's get them into the studio.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Here they come.  Hey.  The new show on WNEW.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  And it's going to be great. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, I'm trying again, dumbass.  Marion, you want to sing along to the song again?  It's the beginning of the show.  The world's impossible this time.  There's no stopping us.  We're going to do it.  It's like it's a end-o now.  Got to train the way it was known now.  I'm going to play it.  Make our dreams come true.  Yeah, sing your theme song.  Do it always. 
[02:25:00]  Yes, always.  What about a huge big hood, huh?  We're going to do it always.  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery.  Make our dreams come true for me and you.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass.  You know who that sounds like?  Arnold Worshack from Welcome Back, Carter.  That ooh, ooh, ooh.  Yeah, when you do that ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  It does.  Hey, they got a point.  It does.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
[02:25:30]  I used to watch that show.  All right, listen, listen, getting dizzy already over here.  Okay, listen, we're going to, Anthony and I in just a couple minutes here are going to  shut up for the next 15 minutes.  We're not going to say a word.  It's your radio show.  You can do whatever the hell you want, okay?  All right.  Hope you can join me in a tall glass of hepatitis.  Lady Di, because you're closer to the phone screen, can you see?  All right, here.  Yes, I can.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to engineer your radio show, okay?  So, Lady Di, if you need to talk to, let's say, TJ on line eight, you go, can I, you know, 
[02:26:00]  TJ on line eight, and I'll plunk them down for you, okay?  All right.  Very good.  All right, so I will just sit back.  You got the view, right, of the screen?  Yes, I do.  Now, let me forewarn you about something.  Okay.  Sometimes the calls are not flattering or fun.  Right.  That's right.  But you must be a professional and rise above it and keep the show rolling.  Keep the show rolling, okay.  We have to deal with that on a daily basis.  That's right.  Okay.  So, don't get upset.  Just keep going.  You're going to get upset.  Maybe if you take, like, five or six phone calls in a row where they're just killing you, 
[02:26:30]  you might want to lay off the phones for a little bit and maybe hit a topic.  Hit a topic.  Talk about the Giants or something.  Right, all right.  And then the phones start rolling on your topic, and you're in.  Right.  Okay.  And then when you're feeling good about yourself again, like Ann said, sure, go right back  to the phone.  Very good.  Okay?  All right.  We'll do that.  The Retard the Burnish Early show can be seen on the Stinky Cam.  Yeah.  Go to www.com.  Click on the Stinky Cam.  You might want to move the Stinky Cam just a little bit, because we only get to see  half of the lovely lady die at this point. 
[02:27:00]  There we go.  There we go.  It's set.  All right.  What are we on?  Perfect.  It's set?  Okay, good.  What are we on?  You guys want some music?  You know how Ann and I come out of the commercials with some rockin' music?  Rockin' music.  Sure.  Get your little intro.  Brian Jovey.  Remember the call letters?  You've got to do that every so often that they're not listening.  Remember the call letters?  Okay.  You've got to do that.  And give out the phone number.  Right, right.  You've got the phone number written down?  I have the phone number.  Don't worry about it.  It's right there on the call.  Let them know who you are.  Okay.  And the call letters, and do your show.  Okay. 
[02:27:30]  And what was I going to say?  Let us know when we're ready.  I just lost my thought here.  I just lost my mind here.  Do you have a name for the show, or are we just going with the retarded Laverne and  Shirley?  Go with the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  That's good enough.  There you go.  All right.  I'm going to set the clock.  You guys have 15 minutes.  15.  Here's your music, ladies and gentlemen.  It's the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  Okay, this is the retarded Laverne and Shirley show.  The number is 212-757-1027, and 877-692-1027. 
[02:28:00]  Those are the lines.  The lines are open.  Call us and give us your thoughts.  All right, Lady Di.  Yes.  What do you want to talk about?  Let's talk about the Rangers that won last night.  Last night's Ranger game.  We were there.  They played a good game.  Right.  They won 4-2.  It was Adam Gray's 300 career goal.  Yeah.  Brian Lee scored two goals.  Right.  So it's pretty good.  They're finally winning again.  That's good.  So let's say, let's go Rangers, hopefully.  They could make the playoffs, do whatever, you know. 
[02:28:30]  Right, right.  The next game is Thursday night.  We'll see what happens Thursday night.  Are you going Thursday night, Marion?  No, I don't have Thursday night's game.  Oh, okay.  I don't go again until next week.  When is the next time you go?  In about two weeks.  Okay.  And what else is in the news?  Let's see.  The Giants won yesterday.  They're going to the Super Bowl.  Right.  First time in 10 years?  In 10 years.  Yep.  Right.  And what do you think about that?  I think that's great.  That the New York team is in there.  Yeah, I'm a Jet fan and a Dallas fan, but what are you going to do?  I think it's pretty good. 
[02:29:00]  I don't think it's that bad.  Okay.  But the Ravens are the ones.  Are the favorites.  Are the favorites.  I think the Giants are going to pull out.  They're going to go all the way.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens.  Okay.  What else is in the news?  Okay.  Okay.  Derek Jeter was at the China Club over the weekend.  Chuck Knobloch and Peter Nedved.  They were all there hanging out at somebody's birthday party.  Right.  Okay.  Let's see.  Other news is over the weekend, Ronald Reagan had hip surgery.  Hope he wishes well.  Get better. 
[02:29:30]  Pretty soon.  I guess in another month, month and a half of spring training.  Right.  What do you say?  For the baseball team.  Let's say.  Let's go Mets.  Let's go Yankees.  Let's go Yankees.  Let's go Mets.  See what happens.  No, the Yankees are going to do it again.  They're going to be all right.  I can't keep doing it year after year after year after year.  Sure they can.  Why?  Come on.  I keep doing it year after year after year after year.  Right.  The tickets go up.  This goes up.  Everybody wants raises.  Yes, we know.  You know, I mean, hey, there's got to be a point.  You know, like, enough is enough.  That is true. 
[02:30:00]  There's no salary cap in baseball.  No, I'll salary cap in half of the sports these days.  Okay, let's see.  What else?  My brain is seizing up.  Okay, today's Martin Luther King's birthday.  It's a national holiday.  Federal state holiday.  Yep, every place is closed, just about.  New Jersey Transit, New Jersey Transit running on a weekend schedule.  So everybody's having parades and whatnot.  Right, right.  If he was alive, I guess he'd be 72 years old. 
[02:30:30]  But what are you going to do?  That's true.  He had a legacy and a dream.  Phone calls.  Phone calls.  I can't see very well.  Can you see them?  No.  I can't see them very well.  I can't see them either.  All right, go to line three.  Go line three.  Line three.  Line three, hello.  Hello.  Yeah, you're on Laverne and Shirley's show.  Yeah, I want to know that.  What can we do for you?  I want to know if that thong you're wearing is from the Gloria Peterbilt line. 
[02:31:00]  That's for you, Diane.  What was that?  That's for you.  What did he say again?  The thong you're wearing.  Was from what line?  Excuse me, sir, what line?  Victoria's Secret.  Oh, my God.  You guys are fabulous.  Thank you.  We like you.  Thank you.  You think we're...  There's a psychomark here, by the way.  I just thought I'd call in.  I want to ask you some questions.  I didn't do a psychomark.  Go ahead.  I want to have them answered.  We don't know you.  I don't know you, but go ahead.  All right, well, you had that operation, right?  Yeah.  Now, did they use a chop saw to remove that cyst from your uterus, or was it a... 
[02:31:30]  No, it was two cysts on my ovaries, and they did not, and I am doing pretty good, okay?  So, hey, you know...  Too bad they didn't operate on your brain and remove that.  Why?  If they did operate on my brain and remove that, so what?  I mean, hey, what are you going to do?  At least, hey, I still got my brains.  Hey, are you falling in the window?  Is there any chance you could throw yourself out the window right now for us live on the air?  No.  Can you throw yourself out the window?  I'm going to. 
[02:32:00]  If you don't get off the air, I'm going to lose my mind.  I'm going to snap.  Well, hey.  Hey, we're all going to snap eventually.  One of these days.  Just die.  Die a little...  I think you're pretty cool.  Hey, I was having fun with that guy.  He died.  Yes.  How you doing?  Okay, how you doing?  Who's this?  This is Anthony.  I got a question for you.  Can you tell your mom to stop changing her lipstick because she's giving me a rainbow?  My mom?  Yeah, she's giving me a rainbow on my junk.  Tell her to stop changing her lipstick.  Oh, come on.  No jokes about my mom.  That's not nice.  Hey, why do you talk with a lisp? 
[02:32:30]  Who, me?  I don't know.  Miriam or whatever the hell the...  I'm the one that talks with a lisp because my teeth are crooked, okay?  The only reason you're here...  Do you talk with a lisp?  Hey, listen.  The only reason you're here is because the coat hanger missed you, you skank.  Hey, you're a skank, too.  Go to hell.  Yeah, you, too.  I was there.  Your mother wasn't home.  I don't care.  You're good, man.  They don't know who I am.  Hey, I don't care.  No.  I don't care.  Okay.  They don't know who I am, so what? 
[02:33:00]  All right, go to line four.  Okay, line four.  Hello?  Hello?  You're on Laverne and Shirley's show.  Hello?  What can we tell you?  What can we do for you?  Wait, am I on our miss?  Yeah, you are.  Are you on?  Oh, my God.  What?  I think they both should give you a time, give you like an hour's show and everything.  We sound pretty good, don't we?  Yeah, you're about as interesting as diarrhea, like, you know, on a night. 
[02:33:30]  You have diarrhea fits so, I guess.  No, no, see, you're about as interesting as diarrhea, because you sound like crap.  No, no, hey.  The teeth are crooked, because who, I mean, your husband must punch you in the mouth every  night, because you just don't, you're so annoying.  Does your wife punch you in the mouth?  You should have kept them on.  I was having a good time with these people.  Okay, go to line six.  I don't care.  I know what to say.  What not to say?  Go to line six.  Hello?  Hello? 
[02:34:00]  Hello?  This is TJ, OJ's brother.  I would like to come down there and slit both of your throats.  Why?  Cut it off.  Because you suck.  Cut it off.  No, we don't.  We sound pretty good.  You suck worse than Nicole did.  If you, if you think, look, if you think you could do something better, come down to  the show, give it a try.  I'll do that.  Why not?  You do that.  I want to hear, I want to hear, I want to hear, I want to hear how you sound.  Uh, line five.  Line five.  Hello?  Hello? 
[02:34:30]  You're on a air with Laverne and Shirley.  Anybody there?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Yes.  What can we do?  This is the retarded Laverne and Shirley show?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, my wife had the same thing.  She had a couple of cysts removed from her ovaries.  Yeah?  And then, like, about a month later, you know, when it was that time of the month, she just  bled to death.  Well, fine.  Well, I'm fine.  Are you okay?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm perfect.  Why?  Okay, I'd like to give a shout-out to all of them.  It must be prejudice.  I don't know.  That's not right.  Where else do we go? 
[02:35:00]  I don't care.  I'll give it right back.  I'm tough.  Yeah, David Wells was traded.  He was traded to the White Sox.  Was he traded to the White Sox?  Yeah.  Well, the Mets wanted him, but I guess, well, I don't know what's going on with that.  Right, right.  The Mets want these players, and all of a sudden, they take their time coming to try and get  players, trying to trade players.  I don't know what they're doing.  I know.  And David Wells wants to the White Sox.  Don't they realize in three weeks, tickets go on sale? 
[02:35:30]  I guess they do.  But what are you going to do?  All right, go to line seven.  All right, we're here to take your call.  Anybody else want to call the show?  Line seven, hello?  Line seven, hello?  Anybody there?  Hello?  Nobody there.  Nobody there?  Okay.  Oh, well.  I guess I decided not to get through.  Forget it, right?  Hello?  Yeah, do you hear me?  Bob, how you doing?  Oh, you hear me?  Hey, Marianne.  Yeah, how you doing, Bob?  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, I'm doing fine. 
[02:36:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing, Bob?  I'm doing pretty good.  You know, I work at a psychiatric center.  We're looking for some radio chicks over there.  You want to come down and be a radio chick down there?  A psychiatric center?  Yeah.  A psychiatric center.  Sure, why not?  Why not?  We could do radio shows in a psychiatric center.  Sure.  I don't think he's even good for that.  I think he got shot.  Oh, come on.  Why?  Let me tell you, Marianne, I won't think.  All right?  What?  Maybe a lady dies.  She would do a really good job.  You talk.  You can't stop talking for a second.  All right?  Just shut your mouth.  That's not nice.  Hey, look, if I can't stop talking for a second, that's to keep the show going and to keep 
[02:36:30]  something to talk about.  No, no, no.  I talk too.  And Diane talks too.  You're talking nonsense.  Everything is nonsense when you talk.  Nothing.  Everything is nonsense.  Okay.  Believe me, I don't talk nonsense.  I can hire you for the psychiatric center, but tell me, Marianne, I can't hire you.  Did you guys split up?  Fine.  We never split up.  No, we're best friends.  You know what?  We're very shortly.  That's it.  You're going to take Sucka Patty with you.  Hey, look, if you work in a psychiatric ward, the name is, you must be nuts. 
[02:37:00]  So, you know, I hate to tell you this.  I hate to tell you this.  You're a little nuts.  All right.  Line 9, Sylvester the Cat.  Hello.  This is Sylvester.  Marion, I would like my list back, please.  What?  Say that again.  Can I have my list back, please?  Oh, get out of here.  Hang on.  You can take your list back.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Shove it up your butt.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What's the matter with you?  Hello.  Okay.  Fred.  Yeah.  How you doing, Fred? 
[02:37:30]  I work hard all day.  Okay.  I try to support a wife and kids.  Right.  Yeah, well.  I come home.  I try to get some entertainment on the way home.  Okay.  What are you two doing on the radio?  We're having fun.  What are you even doing there?  We're having fun.  We're having a good time.  How long have you been friends?  Since we were like 15 years old.  Why?  You can't even hold a conversation between each other.  You sound like absolute idiots.  No, we don't.  We sound like a lot of fun.  If you've been friends for 15 years and you move along from segment to segment, it's the  hardest thing to listen to.  You've got to get off the radio. 
[02:38:00]  We're here to have fun.  That's all.  You've got to go.  Please.  Well, yeah.  Well, we all got to go sometime.  Okay.  Or the horoscopes.  Read the horoscopes, Diane.  Okay.  All right.  For Capricorn, if someone...  Here's today's horoscopes.  Diane's going to read the horoscopes.  Do you want to read them?  Go ahead.  You read them, Diane.  No, no.  You read them.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  If someone you work with seems to know all the answers, it might pay to be a bit suspicious. 
[02:38:30]  Maybe he is really on the ball or maybe he is building himself up to hide his deficiencies.  You can't be too careful.  Okay.  You read Aquarius.  That's mine.  Yeah.  My birthday's coming on.  All right.  Yeah.  So you get to read that one.  Aquarius, the sun enters your birth sign toward the end of this week.  So for the next few days, wind down and look back over the last 12 months.  And when making plans for the next 12 months, listen to your instincts first and other people's second.  Okay?  You can read Pisces. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  I'll read the Pisces.  All right.  Yes.  Oh, Mario.  Mario, you're on the line.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Yeah.  How much would it cost to F you two scrags in a dumper?  How much would it cost to F you in a dumper, buddy?  I don't know.  How much you got?  None of your business.  I don't think you'd be worth a penny.  Oh, come on.  I'm worth more than that.  I'm serious.  I don't think you'd be worth a penny because I don't like your attitude.  I don't like that.  Bad attitude.  What are you going to do?  Hang up on him.  Really?  You got a bad attitude. 
[02:39:30]  I don't like people with bad attitudes.  Serious calls, please.  Serious callers.  Okay.  Glenn, you're on the line.  Oh, yeah.  Good evening, ladies.  Love your show so far.  I got one serious question for you, though.  Sure.  Go ahead.  Spit or swallow?  Neither.  Do you spit or swallow?  Well, you know, it depends on what my wife's giving me, though, you know?  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, the thing is, they'll be a little bit nicer because I feel sorry for your wife because  you must be a real nag.  Oh, my God.  She loves it.  Yeah, well.  Joby, you're on the line.  Steve, you're on the line.  Steve. 
[02:40:00]  Guys.  Hi.  I'd rather hear Stoker Patty talk about her nipple hair.  Hang up the phone, you skank, and bring back the radio chick.  Hang up the phone.  We're here in the studio.  We're here in the studio.  We're having a good time.  We're having a lot of fun.  You hang up the phone.  F you.  F you.  Yeah, F you, too.  F you.  Yeah, you, too.  Come to the studio.  I'll give you F you.  Put my foot up your butt.  Wait.  You are so bad.  Hey.  Okay, Joby, you're on the line.  That's me.  Joby? 
[02:40:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Jason?  No, Jason.  All right, Jason, you're on the line.  Yeah, hi, ladies.  Hi.  I would like a snarling.  I wonder if you could suck my bone dry.  Suck my bone dry.  Grow one.  You probably don't have one.  Okay, hang on.  Okay.  Yo.  Yo.  All right, Joby, long seven.  Yo, do you know the worst part about having sex with a six-year-old girl?  I'm not six years old.  I'm 37 years old.  Getting blood on your clown suit. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, well, you look like a clown.  I wouldn't talk.  Go ahead.  All right, get back to the horoscopes.  Okay, we were at Pisces.  There are many things you want to change, but you never seem to get around to doing much about them.  Perhaps you should take that as a sign you are being too ambitious, and a few days from now, you won't want to change a thing,  so don't force yourself to make any changes today.  You want to read Aries?  Okay, we'll read Aries. 
[02:41:30]  Diane, it's another phone call.  O'Reilly, you're on the phone.  Hello, Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah, hi.  Hello, this is Monsignor O'Reilly from the Dalton Church.  How you doing?  Hi.  How are you?  I just come from Mass, and I've been praying that both of you get killed in a car accident tonight.  That's not nice.  You know, here it is.  I've been praying that you both get killed.  Hang up the phone.  Hang up the phone, you jerk.  You're too fat pig, so you never think about becoming nuns.  Hang up the phone, you jerk.  There's only one job for you to become nuns and kill yourself. 
[02:42:00]  Goodbye.  Bye.  Who the heck are these people?  I don't know if it's bothering me, because I'm giving it right back.  There you go.  If somebody's going to call and get a bad attitude, I'm giving it right back.  So remember one thing right now.  Don't let me answer, because I'll believe me.  You don't want to know me.  Okay, Buddy, you're on the line.  Hi, yes.  This is Buddy Hinton.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  I just want to let you guys know that I took out that little bitch, Cindy Brady, and I'm going to take you out now, you stuttering bitch. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, look, you don't know me.  Take you out?  Take me out where?  On a date?  I'm married.  I wouldn't take you on a date.  I wouldn't go at you anyway, because you don't sound like you'd be too interesting.  So bye.  You don't look at you anyway, you whore.  Yeah, you're your sister.  Actually, I'm with your mother.  Yeah, well, that's...  Oh, cut that.  Cut that.  That's not good.  Sorry.  Okay, Linda.  Linda, you're on the line. 
[02:43:00]  Linda, hello?  Hello.  I guess she's not on the line.  Linda.  Linda, you're on the line.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Okay, how you doing?  Good.  You girls need to elaborate on your story.  Don't take this crap from all these guys.  Oh, well, that's all right.  I'm giving it back to them anyway.  She is.  She is.  Talk about when you guys grew up.  Talk about if you did drugs and what kind of drugs you did.  Your sex life.  I don't mean Anthony don't want to hear about your sex life, but hey, go for it.  I don't know.  Would you want to hear about it? 
[02:43:30]  And what with you guys?  All right.  You know what?  It doesn't bother me because I'm giving it right back.  And believe me, it doesn't.  Because they don't know me.  And believe me, if they were in front of me, I think I'd beat the hell out of them.  Mm-hmm.  I'm tough.  Very tough.  Thank you, Linda.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  I am.  I'm sorry, but I am.  It's me.  Line 5?  Hello.  Yes.  Hello.  What was that?  What was that again?  Hello.  Yes.  Hello.  Yes.  How are you doing? 
[02:44:00]  The who?  Goodbye.  Bye.  What the hell is going on?  I'm going to give you a milk mustache.  Is that who?  Who is this?  Was that Dice?  Who is that?  It's not Dice.  Who is that?  It sounded like him a little.  It sounded like Anna Dice Clay.  Was it?  No, it was.  I don't think it was him.  Okay.  Talk about drugs.  What do you want to talk about?  All right.  What do you want to talk about?  All right.  Diane, they want us to talk about drugs.  Let's see.  What would they like for us to talk about?  All right.  Stuff that we used to do in the past? 
[02:44:30]  Should we or shouldn't we?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Yeah, I know.  What do you think?  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  I mean, we're older now and it's when we were younger and everybody makes mistakes when  we were younger.  Yeah, we used to do those things when we were younger.  We did, but hey.  We did.  Yes, we did.  But if anybody who's 18 and over or 9 or whatever listened, it's no good to do them.  Right.  It's not.  But take it from somebody that knows, somebody that's experienced.  When we were 18 and younger, we did a lot of things and we're 37, 38 right now.  And we don't do those things anymore.  We don't do those things no more. 
[02:45:00]  Well, marijuana.  Yeah.  Okay, we did that for a little while.  We tried a little Coke for a while.  Right, we sure did.  And we drank.  And hey, but when you're younger, you're a teenager, you don't know what you're doing.  Right, exactly.  You figure it out.  Everybody else does the one.  I used to smoke cigarettes and I don't smoke cigarettes no more either.  That stuff is not good for you.  Maybe I should start it up again, but don't.  I'm not.  You feel like it right now, right?  Yeah, I know, right?  Yeah.  Okay, what else?  I would have smoked a cigarette.  Yeah.  What about sex? 
[02:45:30]  What about...  Oh, geez.  Yeah, what about sex?  What about it?  I wouldn't know anything about that right now.  I know.  You don't want...  I could tell you a lot, but it better not.  Okay.  It better not.  Well, don't do it unless you're married.  That's all I got to say.  Okay?  If you're not married, don't do it.  Well, don't do it unless you're in love with your partner.  Yeah, yeah, that too.  You know?  That's got a lot to do with it.  With everything going on these days, you know...  Well, why?  Because it's special.  If you do it with the one you love, it's special.  You got AIDS.  You got all these sexually transmitted diseases out there.  That's right.  So it's better off if you just wait. 
[02:46:00]  You have to be careful.  You have to be careful and, you know, use protection.  That's all.  That's what it is.  And wait.  Until you know you're with the right one.  Wait for what?  Wait until you know you're with the right one.  That's why, you know?  I don't want to wait.  As long as you have to.  Okay, line four.  Line four.  Somebody else's phone?  Diane and Emily never called.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Hi.  How are you doing, lady?  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  I have a quick mathematical question for you. 
[02:46:30]  Sure.  Which is greater, the sum of your two brains or a molecule?  The sum of our two brains is greater.  The sum of our two brains is greater.  I don't know about your brain, though.  But let me tell you, we're very cool and we're having a lot of fun up here.  That's right.  They should park this show through on Death Row.  They'd save a lot of money on it.  You know, I think it's a matter of having fun.  Josephine, you're on the line.  That's all.  If people don't know how to have fun, then they want to...  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, Josephine.  How are you doing?  Okay.  How are you doing? 
[02:47:00]  Okay.  You guys are like, you know, I'm glad you guys are making an effort and everything,  but I drive like an hour, an hour and a half to get home from work every day and I look  forward to O&A and you guys really need to give the show back to them.  Well, they asked us if we want to try it for 15 minutes.  We figured we're having fun.  Really, I mean, it's nice that you guys are trying and everything, but really, I...  You've got to give us credit for that.  We're having fun here.  We're having fun with the guys.  They're nice guys.  They're cool guys.  And it was their idea.  And I said, why not? 
[02:47:30]  It's a lot of fun.  Well, anyway...  No harm.  No harm and done.  It's a lot of luck.  Well, good luck anyway.  Thank you very much.  I mean, it's nice of them to offer.  Jim, hi.  Jim?  Jim.  Hello.  How are you doing, ladies?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Yeah, that was a great anti-drug commercial.  I just whipped my whole stash out the window.  Good.  I'm going to turn out like you.  Fine.  You can pick it up on the Meadowbrook.  Like an ounce of Coke and a pound of weed.  All right. 
[02:48:00]  Well...  Where did you drop it?  Where?  You know.  We can go look for it.  Yeah, we're going to go look for it.  We'll go throw it in the sewer.  Oh, God.  I don't want to turn out like that.  Well...  Love you, girls.  Yeah, we like you, too.  We like you, too.  I really do love you, though.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  I know.  You don't know us.  That's good.  Marion.  Yeah, hi.  Me and you slept together.  What?  No, we didn't.  No, we...  You were telling me I was a stallion.  No, we didn't.  You said you're a stallion.  All right.  Yeah.  Bye. 
[02:48:30]  Bye.  We're not on methadone.  We're having a lot of fun.  You guys suck.  Bye.  Well, so do you.  Thanks.  I don't want to say what you suck, but...  Okay, Mickey, you're on the line.  Oh, no.  Hello?  Hello?  Mickey?  Hello?  This, Mikey.  Oh, Mikey.  Yeah, hello, hello.  Hi.  Yes, I'm 15 years old.  Okay.  And I really, really think you guys are great.  You're doing a very good show.  Well, thank you very much.  And then when you start talking about the dope, the cocaine, and the marijuana, well, it makes 
[02:49:00]  me want to do it because you two are like my role models.  Oh, God.  And...  No, no, don't do that stuff.  Don't ever start that stuff.  Are you sure?  Don't start that stuff.  Well, no, because, see, oh, my daddy's abusive, too.  Well, that's terrible.  That's terrible.  Last night, he donkey-punched me.  Is your daddy Andrew Dice Clay?  Who?  Is your daddy Andrew Dice Clay?  Andrew Dice Clay?  No.  No, no.  Who is your father?  Oh, no. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  Well, I hope everything works out.  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  We have to wrap up the show.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, um...  Yes?  XFL?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, that's the new, uh...  Thing is coming out.  Mm-hmm.  What's about it?  All right, well, we have to wrap up the show, but before we do, we have to talk about the  XFL?  Yeah, XFL.  Get ready for hard-hitting, smash-mouth football like you've never seen before.  Okay, and the XFL and the New York City, New Jersey Hitmen are here, and the tickets 
[02:50:00]  are on sale now for all five home games.  On your birthday, Marion...  Oh, yeah, February 11th.  Isn't that nice?  Read that.  That's their first home game.

Okay, and tickets for this and all five Hitman home games are now on sales, on sales at all  Ticketmaster outlets by calling Ticketmaster at 212-307-7171 or at Ticketmaster.com. 
[02:50:30]  This is the football that WWF is promoting, so I hear it's supposed to be pretty good.  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Yes, hello?  Hello, lady.  Oh, yes.  Is this Lady Di?  Yes, it is.  Oh, Lady Di, let me tell you, I'm having a wonderful time listening to your show.  Well, thank you very much.  And ever since you talked about it, I just wanted to ask you a question.  What is that?  Go ahead. 
[02:51:00]  Have you ever gotten into a shovel fight without a shovel?  You're mongoloid-looking...  No, goodbye.  Bye.  You look like a mongoloid.  Goodbye.  Okay.  Okay.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  I don't care.  That doesn't...  They don't know where.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  He says, you got to see the Hitman as they ice the Thunderbolts to Orlando Rage to L.A.  Extreme, the Memphis Maniacs, and the Chicago Enforcers all at Giant Stadium.  Okay, Uncle John, you're on the phone? 
[02:51:30]  Hi, ladies.  How are you doing?  All right.  How are you doing?  I'd just like to tell you, I'm really enjoying your show.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  But then again, I also like to drive an ice pick into my ear, so...  Well, good.  It helps.  You can drive an ice pick somewhere else, too.  You got it on cocaine.  That must have been hysterical.  Why?  The what?  I don't know.  What's hysterical?  What's hysterical?  You must have sounded like Heckle and Jekyll.  Well, yeah, sort of.  Let me tell you, we're doing this for fun.  I mean, it's just fun.  Right.  Well, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.  We are.  Thank you very much.  The suicide rate in New Jersey just went up 12%.  Yeah, well, goodbye.

All right, how are you doing?  My name is Rob.  I'm from the Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting.  Yes.  And I'd like to offer a full scholarship.  Okay.  A merit scholarship to both you and, well, Luper and Shirley.  And I just think you guys are worth the effort. 
[02:53:00]  Okay, well, thanks a lot.  Thank you very much.  We're trying.  We're having a lot of fun here.  We've got to wrap up the show, though.  Okay, I'm sorry.  All right, thank you.  No problem.  We have to wrap up the show right now.  Bye, we have to wrap up.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Okay, now we've got to wrap up the show now.  We'll give it back to O.B. and Anthony.  Thank you for listening to 102.7 WNEW and the Retired Laverne and Shirley.  Keep listening to the show, the good guys, and it was nice of them for us to ask if they  want to do this for a little while.  Right.  Really.  Very nice of them.  They're very good guys. 
[02:53:30]  And also the producer, everybody that works in the studio is very good.  Okay.  So keep listening to the show, guys, please.  Keep on calling the show.  We'll give it back to O.N.A.  We'll be back after the break.  Bye.  Are we still on?  Yeah.  But what do we do?  What do we do now?  What do we do?  All right.  We gave it back to you.  We gave it back to you guys.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  We gave it back to you guys.  Go ahead. 
[02:54:00]  What is this, a silent game now?  Come on.  We didn't start.  We're not bad.  Hey, Emily never called in, Diane.  Emily never.  Okay.  Emily never called in.  All right.  Emily.  Yes.  What?  Wait, what?  We are wrapping it up.  We do wrap up.  Okay.  We're going to give the show back to O.N.A. right now.  Here they are, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you for letting us try out, guys. 
[02:54:30]  You guys were wonderful.  Where did they go?  They don't leave the studio?  I don't know.  Where did they go?  Opie.  We're going to go to commercial break.  Okay?  We're going to commercial break right now.  Then I'll be back on after the commercial.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you for listening very much.  It was fun.  What do we do?  What are we doing? 
[02:55:00]  I guess we've got to keep on talking.  Anybody else in the lines?  Anybody else?  Line four?  Anybody else wants to call in, call us and give us your comments.  How about if I read more?  Hey, Emily, if you're still listening to the show, give Diane a call.  She'd like to hear from you.  All right.  Let me go to the next one over here.  Hello?  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence to this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:55:30]  NEW.  We've got to get through the commercials, and we're going to get an update from Stinky.  They're making their road trip to Mississippi, and it looks like Earl is hearing this.  There's a problem.  There's the first problem of the road trip.  First problem.  And we'll check in with those guys in a couple minutes here.  But first, the New York Sports Clubs, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's stopping you from getting in the best shape of your life this year?  New York Sports Clubs makes joining its gyms as easy as ordering cheesecake.  Ho-ho! 
[02:56:00]  Ho-ho!  And much less fattening.  The scary tactics of some gyms, the high-pressure sales sharks,  deceptive pricing and long-term contracts, you can't get out of.  Man, I hate these things.  They tell stories.  Just give us the facts.  They tell stories.  The scary tactics of some gyms, the high-pressure sales sharks,  deceptive pricing and long-term contracts,  you can't get out of, make you sweat, but don't help you get in shape.  Right.  Oh.  New York Sports Clubs has a better way, a stress-free way.

[02:57:30]  Well, I think the Retard Laverne and Shirley show went very well today, Anthony.  Well, Kurt said it seems the only requirements for guest hosting the ONA show  is not having anything to say and being able to take lots of hate calls.  It seems to be it.  They went over their time they were doing so well.  Oh, yeah.  We got bonus Retard Laverne and Shirley show today.  Bonus show.  Is it really considered bonus?  Tom, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Today on the Laverne and Shirley show, I learned that when you have cysts removed from your ovaries, 
[02:58:00]  part of the procedure is cutting out half your tongue.  Oh.  Oh, that'll leave a bruise.  She sounds like that, like, lesbian puppet from the land of make-believe on Mr. Rogers.  You know, the one with the rosy cheeks?  That's an obscure reference, but yes, I know what you're talking about.  Is it Princess Winter Spring Summer Fall?  Meow, meow, Henrietta wants to kill herself, meow, meow.  All right, boys.  Nice, Tom.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:58:30]  Mike, what's going on?  No, you guys got to do that again.  That's one of the funniest bits I've heard in deep.  Yeah.  You have to.  Now, we're running out of tards around here, F-tards.  Yeah, F-tards to do F-tard shows.  All I know is your fans make it the best, though.  The hangar line, oh, my God, they almost cracked up my car.  What got me was the, um, did you guys go to a shovel fight without a shovel?  You ain't gonna win that one.  Shovel fight.  Randall, what's going on? 
[02:59:00]  Randall?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony, I thought you were an intelligent guy.  What are you doing letting them on the air, one?  And two, they're not even qualified to teach you the ABCs.  They did very good.  Oh, yeah.  If you put them on the air, you lost the listener.  We were definitely entertained, I got to say.  Hell, yeah.  That's why they went over there 15 minutes.  I was laughing too hard to keep track of the time.  Nicole.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I'm a little upset.  Why?  Because as a faithful listener, I share my beautiful breath on a regular basis 
[02:59:30]  to the rest of the Opie and Anthony world.  Oh, you rock.  But you put me through 15 minutes of torture on Friday.  Uh-huh.  And you did it again today.  It was 29 minutes today.  Yeah.  It felt like three days.  But, you know.  All right.  Well, we're back to regular programming.  Yeah, but I can't reciprocate as a listener if you keep doing this.  We're trying to help management out and find a couple new shows that we can put on  on WNW.  Could it not be that again?  I don't know. 
[03:00:00]  I think the retarded Laverne and Shirley were a hit,  and they're going to have to come back in the future.  Oh, yeah.  Because I can't.  I got to give back the wow stickers.  No, no, no.  Don't do that, Nicole.  I might have to.  Thank you.  All right.  I got to cut you short because Stinky's checking in from his road trip to Mississippi  with Black Earl.  Yeah.  Dan from Hoboken and Scott, the driver, Anthony.  And we have a problem.  They've been driving for three and a half hours.  Last we checked, they were somewhere in Pennsylvania.  Let's say hi to Stinky.  Stinky, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, we just got to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. 
[03:00:30]  And about 20 miles back, Earl was like, you know, we should take a breather or something.  And everyone was like, eh, not time yet.  Ten minutes later, oh, my shoulder.  Like the tendinitis is building up.  Like you were trying to get some trick to get us to pull over.  And then magically it's gone away and nothing.  No, no.  Get away, Earl.  I'll open the door for him.  Earl says I'm lying, but I'm not.  Hey, Stinky, give it to Dan from Hoboken. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  Here you go.  He'll be able to tell.  He'll be able to tell us what happened.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Dan, what's going on on this road trip?  What?  What's going on with Earl whining and crying?  I don't know.  It was kind of bizarre.  I mean, the guy, he just doesn't seem to be comfortable.  I'm hearing something about claustrophobic.  Excuse me?  Like we were getting reports that Earl was getting claustrophobic.  He was.  I mean, all of a sudden we're hearing noises like whenever it gets quiet,  kind of like a banging, scratching sound on the side of the car. 
[03:01:30]  Not quite sure what's going on.  And then this fake injury.  And he was trying to get you guys to pull over to get out and get some air or something  because he's claustrophobic.  Well, Stinky just didn't want to pull over because we wouldn't pull over when we passed  High Street like he wanted to.  I dig.  I dig the tunnels to get out.  So are people hanging in there, Dan?  Yeah, we're doing okay.  Yeah, all right.  Let me talk.  Scott's getting a little annoying.  Scott's getting a little annoying, the bus driver.  Yeah, he's turned from lame joke guy to lame O&A reference guy.  Ah. 
[03:02:00]  Very good at it.  And then everything, every other word out of Earl's mouth is an Arnold clip, which is  sort of getting on my nerves.  God, see?  It's not taking long, people.  I think I have an Arnold that's touching me, which is kind of, his shoulder hurt five  seconds ago, but he's difficult to kind of run to kill.  Who do you think you are, Rich Voss?  Oh, wow.  All right, let's talk.  You feel it brewing?  Yep.  Hey, Earl, let's talk to Earl.  Hello?  Earl.  Earl.  Yo.  What seems to be the problem? 
[03:02:30]  There is no problem.  I had a little problem with my shoulder.  I never suggested that we stop.  You were clenching over a pain.  Yes, I wasn't.  I was not in the, you keep quiet, but I had a little inflammation in my shoulder, but I'm  fine.  Inflammation.  Inflammation.  From what?  You're not working.  I'm sorry?  Don't you have to work to get inflammation?  From what?  How did your shoulder get hurt sleeping in a...  My shoulder's always been screwed up. 
[03:03:00]  So, you couldn't do anything in the vehicle to make it feel better?  Oh, it came and it went.  Earl, are you going to make it to Mississippi?  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.  Are you going to make it to Mississippi?  Yes, I'll be fine to Mississippi.  Yeah?  I think he's getting a little itchy.  He wants to, how do I explain it?  Eat a Calzone.  Eat a Calzone, yes.  Eat a Calzone, exactly.  He's thinking about Calzone.  I got really excited when we passed High Street. 
[03:03:30]  All right, well, let's talk to Stinky.  Earl?  Earl?  Wait, wait.  Yeah.  Quickly, is that an old picture-hanging injury you have on that arm?  No, stop it.  No?  Oh, just asking.  All right, let's talk to Stinky again.  Yeah, hold on.  All right.  This is typical Earl.  What's up?  It's typical Earl.  Earl always says, you know, complains and bitches and moans.  And then when you call him out, I never said that.  That's exactly what he's doing right now.  Right, Stink?  Exactly.  He was really, like, folded over and, like, screaming about his shoulder, and he was rubbing 
[03:04:00]  it.  It really looked like a serious injury.  Oh, boy.  And all of a sudden, it's gone.  Oh, are you guys going to make it to Mississippi, Stink?  Oh, yeah, we're making it.  Yeah, are you guys watching any DVDs or anything yet?  No, not yet.  Actually, we're just sitting here talking about nothing, really.  Yeah, we listened to the Perfect Circle album.  That was it.  Oh, that album rocks.  Hey, Stink, has Earl become the Opie and Anthony soundboard yet? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And the driver, too.  They both have, like, all the O&A references.  Must drive you nuts.  You've heard them all.  I know.  All right, Stink.  Hang in there.  We'll do, guys.  All right, we'll talk to you guys.  You got to check in before 7 before we get out of here tonight.  We'll do.  All right.  See you.  And you're in the middle of Pennsylvania?  Yeah, we lost him.  In the middle of Pennsylvania still, Anthony.  Unbelievable.  Already, you could feel it.  Right under the surface.  We have two songs about the road trip. 
[03:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  The Stinky Earl road trip to Mississippi.  Yeah.  Your brother's song we're going to play again before we get out of here at 7.  Sure.  But right now, we want to play the other one that came in today from our buddy, our pal,  Q, who's in the studio.  Q, been hanging with us today.  Here it is once again.  Are we going to get Reagan on the phone today?  I hope so.  Yeah, why don't we play this song, and we won't do a break, and we'll get Reagan on and see  how he's feeling in the hospital, okay?  All right.  All right. 
[03:05:30]  Well, his name is Black Earl, and he whines like a girl.  Every time someone asks him to get busy.  Yeah, he really likes the doors, and he wears black clothes.  But inside, he's whiter than a lily.  Well, they'll load him in the van with that wreath, the smoking man, and try to make it  down to Mississippi.  If they break down on the way, what will those rednecks say?  You know they love some niggas and hippies. 
[03:06:00]  Black Earl and Stinky.  Which one's gay?  Black Earl and Stinky.  Rotten all the way.  Black Earl and Stinky.  Hide that chain.  Black Earl and Stinky.  Or W-O-N-A.  Well, Stinky's kind of crazy, and Earl's kind of lazy. 
[03:06:30]  They mix like oil and water.  When they get down south, they'll have to work it out and be closer than a mother and  daughter.  And when she meets Black Earl, she may want to hurl.  Who knows what the girls will think of Stinky.  And even though he's from New York, there's a chance to get poor and end up with some swapping on his wing, yeah.  Black Earl and Stinky.  Which one's gay? 
[03:07:00]  Black Earl and Stinky.  Rotten all the way.  Black Earl and Stinky.  Hide that chain.  Black Earl and Stinky.  I'm W-O-N-A.  Black Earl and Stinky.  I'm W-O-N-A.  Black Earl and Stinky.  I'm W-O-N-A.  Black Earl and Stinky.  I'm W-O-N-A.  Black Earl and Stinky.  I'm W-O-N-A.  There you have it.  Cue song about the road trip to Mississippi.  Yeah.  Very, very nice.  You think they're going to make it by tomorrow, Anthony? 
[03:07:30]  I think so.  We're hoping, you know, when we get on the air tomorrow, that they're very close to Winona, Mississippi.  Well, I think now it's imperative that they do this as quickly as possible, seeing the breakdown in the passengers that has happened only a few hours into the drive.  You know, we figured that it's a 22-hour ride.  Yeah.  They're only three and a half hours in, and they're already something starting.  Nothing major.  Hearing Earl saying, yeah, my arm hurt, but everything's fine.  And then Stinky saying, oh, no, he was bitching like a baby that his arm hurt. 
[03:08:00]  I wish we could just stay in the air until they get to Mississippi, because I'm telling you right now, you get around 11, 12 o'clock tonight, and they're still driving, it's going to be some brilliant radio.  I just hope they get it on Dad or film it or whatever.  I think we pounded it in their heads enough that the second anything starts happening, tape it.  Because I guarantee you, you will get a clip of Earl going, knock it off, turn that off.  This isn't funny.  Shut up.  Like, really getting crazy.  Everyone taunting him, and the camera's still rolling. 
[03:08:30]  And then there's going to be a brawl.  There you go.  I can see it.  All right, we've got to move on to other things here, Anthony.  Yeah.  The Tyson story might have to wait until tomorrow.  Yeah, that's okay.  Because we've got to squeeze your brother's song in.  We've got to get another update from Stinky and Earl.  Mm-hmm.  And we've got to talk about former President Reagan.  Now we can quickly talk to Reagan, I hope.  Well, Reagan's...  We've been leaving him on hold for so long.  Reagan's been on hold for about an hour now.  Yeah.  Hour and a half.  I think longer, about an hour and a half.  Hour and a half.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone knows the story. 
[03:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  Former President Reagan, who's going to be 90.  Yeah.  Wow.  Poor old codger.  He fell.  He broke his hip.  Everyone knows the story.  But Ann was telling me something I didn't know.  Mm-hmm.  Like, the little ballie that goes into your hip joint there.  Yeah, when you look at a skeleton, you've got your thigh bone, and it's got that ball  on it, and it fits in the socket in your hip.  It wasn't his actual hip, the pelvis that broke.  It was that ball on top of your thigh that just snapped off.  Little age.  You know, it happens.  It's like the ball joint on your car, you know? 
[03:09:30]  Your car gets a little old.  Before you know it, it's on the side of the road with the tire all kablooey on the side.  Yeah.  Little cock guy.  It's kind of sad.  I mean, a lot of people say when you start breaking your hip, the end is near.  Yeah.  When we're talking about the president, like you said earlier, I mean, the guy has been shot.  He's a superhero.  He's had cancer, he has Alzheimer's, now he's breaking a hip.  Doesn't bother him.  Indestructible.  They don't care.  Remember in 1980, when he was running for president, they said, ah, Reagan's too old.  Too old to even be president. 
[03:10:00]  And that was 20 years ago?  Yeah.  Oof.  But he lives on.  Well, Anthony, let's go to the phones and see how the former president is doing here.  All right.  Mr. Reagan, Mr. President.  Yeah, let me plug down the line here.  Hello, Mr. President.  Hello, sir.  Hello?  Hello?  Hmm.  Maybe something's screwed out front with the phones, because Stinky isn't here and he usually  runs them.  Yeah.  I bet.  I'll take a look.  I'll see if it's the right line picked.  No, Ann.  They have something like that. 
[03:10:30]  Ann, where are you going?  And I'm going to see if they have the right line picked.  No.  Ann, it's the former president.  He's probably just napping.  They're going to wake him up in a sec.  They know we're live in New York.  I think the phone line is okay.  Come back in here.  Ann.  He does this every time the former president calls our radio show.  I don't understand it.  Hello, Mr. Reagan.  Hello, sir.  Hello, sir.  I hear someone picking up the line.  Tell Anthony we got him on the line.  Hey!  That old gag.  Ah, Mr. Reagan! 
[03:11:00]  Hello.  Mr. Reagan, it's Opie and Anthony.  We got you live in New York on the radio.  You're looking for Mr. Reagan?  Yes.  Please hold.  I'll get him.  No, no, sir.  You're...  No, you're...  He was here a minute ago.  Wait, I...  I swear I saw him.  No, no, no, sir.  There he is now.  Wait a minute.  Hey, he's...  He's also on the phone and waving back at me.  Yeah, you're looking in a mirror.  Oh, is that what that is?  Yes, Mr. Reagan.  Hello, and God bless the Ukraine.  Why the Ukraine? 
[03:11:30]  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Hello, my fellow Americans.  Mr. Gorbachev, take down those pants.  No, you don't want to see that.  Well...  Mr. Reagan.  Yes.  Everyone wants to know how you're doing.  You broke your hip over the weekend.  Well, yes, I seem to have had an accident.  My bones are...  Well, the consistency of graham crackers.  Oh, my God.  And I thought...  Jesus.  God damn it.  I thought, you know, you turned to dust after you died, but for some reason, God's playing 
[03:12:00]  this tremendous joke on me.  I'm decomposing while still alive.  Are you doing okay, sir?  Well, yes.  The bone old Ron needs still works, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, I guess we know what you mean.  Yeah.  You know, the old Ron going out with the bone that works with plenty of bling, bling, and  ice.  You got bling, bling, and ice?  I'm your Mac Daddy, Ron.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Maybe we'll get some bling, bling, and ice for your 90th birthday coming up February 6th. 
[03:12:30]  90?  Holy Jesus Christ.  Yeah, yeah.  Could someone kill me already?  No.  I swear to God.  No.  I want to die.  No, you don't, sir.  If you have ever seen Nancy, believe me, she's been very helpful.  She makes me want to die.  Now, and Mr.  Thank God for Alzheimer's.  Sometimes I forget who I'm married to.  Mr. Reagan, you have told us on this radio show that you're faking the Alzheimer's so  you don't have to deal with your wife.  It's me on the Alzheimer's, yay. 
[03:13:00]  Okay.  Yes.  I'm fully aware of who I am and who the hell I'm married to.  Yeah.  Is she right by your side there, Mr. Reagan?  Yeah.  She can't talk.  She's right here.  Yeah.  Look at her.  She looks like a silhouette of one of those all-day suckers.  A little stick and a big giant head.  My God.  Oh, no, Nancy.  Who?  What?  I don't know.  I forget about the pain because of the Alzheimer's.  Well, thank God.  Occasionally it comes back. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  I realize my hip bone was snapped like Weisman's leg.  Ah.  Oh, it's coming back.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Sir.  That hurt.  Sir.  Yes.  Are you all right?  Hello.  Are you okay?  Yes.  All right.  I broke my hip.  I realized I was married to Nancy and threw myself down the stairs.  No.  Hoping it would kill me, but what the hell am I?  No, that's not a good thing.  Did I come from Krypton and someone didn't tell me, please kill me? 
[03:14:00]  Well, you're going to be released from the hospital soon, sir.  I will survive.  Hey, hey.  I'm celebrating.  Yeah.  Martin Luther King Day.  Yes, today.  He's a big...  The great inventor of the cotton gin and the flow bean.  That wasn't the Martin Luther King, sir.  I'm a sailboat.  My socks are falling down.  What?  The bombing starts in five minutes.  Hello?  Um, Mr. Reagan?  Yes.  It was 15 years ago, uh, the shuttle, uh, exploded.  The Challenger. 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  Those poor people.  Yeah.  On the, uh...  What was that?  The Challenger?  The space shuttle?  Oh, yes.  That was...  Who cares?  My hip is broke.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to run for office again.  Are you?  In four years.  Yeah?  From the coffin.  Please, I hope to Christ, I'm dead.  No, no.  A lot of people want to, uh, see you make a full recovery.  Have you seen me?  Uh, no.  We haven't seen you in many years, sir.  The last picture of me was sitting on a park bench licking an ice cream cone with a small child next to me. 
[03:15:00]  I once had my finger on the button to the bomb.  Now I'm licking ice cream cones, drooling, and bones are breaking.  Ah, God, that sounded like it hurt.  Sir?  Hello?  Mr. Reagan?  Yes, my arm bone just snapped right off.  The weight of the phone was too much.  Ah, well...  I sneezed, and my leg went backwards at the knee.  Oh, God, it's grossing out. 
[03:15:30]  Look, when you see Ron, put a chair over my head.  Yeah.  Please kill me.  I can't take...  Have you seen Nancy?  She's right next to you.  She's this skinny little rail in Wim.  Yeah.  Her ass looks like two pieces of cauliflower stuck together.  The cellulite is mind-boggling.  All right.  I can't handle it.  Old Ron's got to get laid.  Well, good luck with that.  My one bone-like...  Yes?  Maybe one of those hot nurses that are taking care of you. 
[03:16:00]  Yes, they really want a man that craps himself.  It's quite a treat for these young nurses.  Yeah.  To clean my own crap off of my shriveled, wrinkled old ass.  God, then we...  I was knocking them down three at a time in old Hollywood when I was doing those Bonzo movies.  Yeah.  Now I'm throwing feces like the monkey.  Sir, we don't need that visual.  Yes, well, it's my life.  All right, listen...  Ronald Reagan's waving at the window again.  No, no, no, that's you. 
[03:16:30]  No, sir, that's you.  Yes.  You're looking into a mirror.  What's that?  Hello?  Sir, we're going to...  I will survive.  No, sir, we're just going to let you go and get some rest, okay?  Yes.  All right?  Mr. Reagan?  Thank God I'm not there with you and the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  God damn, I got a break in this room.  Yes, you did.  That's horrific.  All right.  All right, Mr. Reagan.  We'll let you go, okay?  Yes.  All right, sir. 
[03:17:00]  Godspeed.  Godspeed to you, too.  There he goes.  The former president of the United States of America is going to be 90, February 6th.  And once again, Anthony missed the president.  Anthony.  Ant.  Ah!  Ant.  Oh, my God.  What do you mean you got it?  Ant, he's gone.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan, one of my favorites.  Ant, he's gone.  Hello?  He's gone.  Hello?  He's gone.  I talked to him.  I don't know where you are, so.  God damn it. 
[03:17:30]  That old man.  Hello?  No, sir.  He's gone.  I always go away when Reagan's on.  What happens?  Was Superman here?  All right, let's take a break, Anthony, huh?  Yes, please.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the ONA show.  Very educational.  We're going to check in with Stinky one more time.  And we're going to leave the show today with your brother Joe's song about the road trip to Mississippi.  Yes.  We're going to squeeze all that in next.  No, don't lift your arms up.  Someone else.  Look at, look at, look at, Marianne just tweaked her love handles. 
[03:18:00]  You better.  I do not.  Lady Di.  You're lifting me.  Carry on, but I'll go.  Lady Di, she just grabbed your love handle there.  Yeah.  What is that for?  See?  Because you're going like this.  Oh, okay.  No, look.  Lady Di, let me tell you something.  Those pants look a little tight around the midsection.  Yeah, all right.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to try to lose the weight.  48-hour Hollywood miracle dying.  Anthony?  I'll try.  Yeah, okay.  After seeing Lady Di's back, you know, it's all about honesty on this show. 
[03:18:30]  Lady Di does not have back boobs.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  All right.  Neither do I.  I told you I didn't.  Well, you've also said other things.  We just have to check.  I'll try that Hollywood diet.  Do you have any other samples or, you know?  Maybe we can help you out.  Yes.  Where do you get that?  You better, you know.  Yes, I will.  Strap your bra back on.  The best diet to go on.  The best diet to go on.  No, no, no.  They're starting to fall a little bit.  Opie, Anthony, the best diet to go on these days.  It's the 48-hour Hollywood miracle diet.  It is.  It is.  It is for this, for the rest of this break. 
[03:19:00]  Okay.  Thank you.  But it's also Weight Watchers, too.  No, it is, of course, the 48-hour.  It's also a Hollywood miracle diet.  Hollywood miracle diet.  And you know what the best part of it is?  I've seen it.  It's not sacred, too.  It comes in a nice, big, like a Snapple bottle-looking thing that you could just lay over Marion's  head if you see her on the street.  So that's even better.  Lady Di, you want me to help you with your bra?  I'm all right.  Okay.  You want to go to the bathroom?  You look a little awkward there.  No, no, no.  I'm all right.  Can you get everything back in place?  Yes, everything back in place.  You sure?  Back in place.  Yes, it is.  What about over there? 
[03:19:30]  There's something sticking out.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's supposed to be there.  All right.  I don't have that.  I don't have to worry about that.  She's squirming around like an escape artist in a straight jacket.  I don't have to do that.  I don't have to worry about that.  Yeah, all right.  Okay?  All right.  Well, I don't.  I don't.  Must say, Lady Di...  I wear stuff I'm comfortable with.  Can I say something?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I just have to say that Lady Di is the sexy one in the duo.  Oh, you're seeing that?  Yeah, I'm seeing that.  And Marion's more like the brain of the organization, of the duo.  Oh, there you go. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, you don't have a brain.  You know, brain and brawn, you know?  Right, right.  Very nice.  Right here?  Would you agree with me?  Lady Di more than the sex pot?  Yeah, 15 minutes.  Oh, but do you need an amyl nitrate under your nose or something?  A popper?  Are you dozing off?  Can I say something?  Yes.  Opie's a nice one.  There you go.  See, I'm kind of what?  You like Anthony.  Anthony, you're like in love with him.  Forget it.  I like Opie a lot.  Opie's more of a nice one.  Yeah, because I noticed your brain power, right?  Yeah.  I saw past the lisp. 
[03:20:30]  When are we going on a double date?  I saw past the lisp and the cross eyes.  The cross eyes.  When are we going on a double date?  Yeah, when are we going to see a movie?  You said something about a double date.  You said we're going to see a movie together.  When I can find a good position for the snipers.  We will go.  We'll all go.  Certain rooftops, anywhere else.  Marion, let it be said.  I would go on a date with you if I knew I was getting some action.  How about that?  I'll give you action.  You give me a little?  I'd probably bang Marion because she seems like the dirty girl.  No, no, no.  Don't start that.  She seems like the dirty one. 
[03:21:00]  I could tell during the show, during your own show that you two were doing, Marion's  the one like, ah, you know, she said ass.  And she's like, ah, stick it.  Stick it where the sun don't shine.  Like you were giving it back.  So I could tell she's probably in bed like, yeah, you better F me good.  And let me go one step further.  F me good or walk.  Let me go one step further.  I think Marion and I have a little connection because she has a little bit of a...  Attitude, a little anger problem.  I know.  I like that.  Yeah, I like that.  I always think.  That's the way I was brought up.  See, I'm reading you.  Those teeth don't get in the way, do they?  No.  You're like...  No. 
[03:21:30]  No.  Hey, my husband was trying to call.  You could have asked him.  You like a nice hand across your ass every so often?  My husband was trying to call.  You could have asked him, but...  You'd like that?  A hand across your ass every so often?  Whack.  I'm not talking to you.  You like...  You like my...  Well, not about that.  Okay.  What?  That was mine.  What?  You like that?  You like that?  What do you say with Opie?  You leave Anthony.  Don't...  You're the one I want.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, what's the problem?  I called you the sex bot.  I know you did.  I usually go for the sexy women, but I'm thinking the brains this time around. 
[03:22:00]  Okay.  There you go.  Look at that.  I don't have brains.  I don't have brains.  Of course you have brains.  Call 1-800-NEW-DIET, Opie.

[03:22:30]  Just like you, Opie.  I don't get you in trouble.  I have trouble telling you two apart these days.  You're promoting a diet.  I'm promoting my own diet.  And how much are they paying you to promote this?  Neither.  Well, these people are paying good money on this show, not to be confused with a lousy,  crappy diet system that you went on.  Weight Watchers is a thing.  Hey, how about a visual testimonial?  She's endorsing Weight Watchers.  I'm endorsing the Hollywood Miracle Diet.  And he's...  Well, Ann.  There you go.  Well, Ann, you look so hot.  I'll have to go with... 
[03:23:00]  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  I'll have to go with the 48-hour Hollywood Diet.  You've got to eat a little more, Anthony.  Oh, I've got to eat a little more?  Yeah.  How about...  I mean, when you were growing up, you...  Hey.  You probably eat more.  I eat like a human being.  Hey, Lady Di.  What?  Why?  He's a little self-conscious of his weight.  Oh, okay.  No, I'm serious.  No way.  He looks like...  He looks good.  He eats a lot.  He looks good.  It's the...  He does.  It's the...  What, the Coke?  I don't know about...  We don't want to know.  We don't want to know.  Well... 
[03:23:30]  He freebases.  Yeah.  I'm doing a freebase now.  Now, you were calling the Z when you were doing a fake orgasm, don't you?  Doing the freebase, you know.  Keeps the weight down.  You even called me up.  Friday.  Hey, did you hear the show?  Me, LT, Daryl.  When I did that.  We all go together, find some Coke whores and some Coke.  All right, ladies.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  We have to take a break so we can check in with Stink.  Yes, ma'am.  1-800 is a new diet.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  We say hello.  It was very nice talking to you again.  Thanks, guys.  Very lovely.  You guys are good. 
[03:24:00]  We'll call us again.  Oh, we'll be calling you.  Well, we'll call you.  We'll definitely call you soon.  We'll call you.  You'll never call us.  Maybe for one of your birthdays, okay?  My birthday's February 11th.  Oof.  That might be too soon.  Jesus Christ.  What are the odds of that?  Maybe St. Patty's Day or something.  We'll stop back up again.  There you go.  St. Patty's Day is a Saturday this year.  Yeah.  Like I said, maybe St. Patty's Day.  Because you know why?  No, it's because she's going.  Okay.  Why don't we let the Retroiler burn shortly leave the studio?  I already know these.  Of course I know these things.  I have to know these things.  A lot of people now, after you're saying things about Marion, about her, you know, and you 
[03:24:30]  might want to hook up, now they're crucifying Dr. Filatov, saying that he did not do anything  to your vision.  By the way, very special day.  One year ago today.  Now people are saying it's not working because you're finding her attractive.  We'll have a good time.  Anthony?  Anthony?  Yeah.  We'll have a couple of beers together.  Let me teach you something about women.  A couple of beers.  Please?  Yeah.  It's not all about, you know, boobs and ass and stuff.  Sometimes you have to look past that and see. 
[03:25:00]  What, to the CD wall behind them?  Where?  How far past are you looking?  You have to look past that sometimes.  And when you realize that someone has something to offer upstairs, it's not all about the big  boobs and the tight ass and the bald, you know what.  Right?  There's more to life, Anthony.  Yes, there it is, Opie.  Take that away from this show right now.  I wish there was something else I could take away from this show.  Look at the Mary in there.  She's got the personality, the intelligence, the brains.  There you go.  And so do I. 
[03:25:30]  I think for the first time in my life, I could see past, you know, see past, you know, an ugly  body.  Dude, shut the F up, man.  Hey, I'm going to tell you, we're good.  We're Bill.  I'm Bill.  I'm Bill.  You look good.  Believe me.  You look good.  All right.  All right, ladies.  Thank you.  I work out.  I walk.  All right, ladies.  We got to go because we got to check in with Stinky.  Okay.  Yeah.  Thank you, girl.  We said hi.  It was great seeing you.  And thank you for doing that once again.  Thank you.  Thank you for letting us do that show for 15 minutes.  Oh, no problem.  It was a half hour, but who's keeping track?  Thank you, Means. 
[03:26:00]  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  There they go.  Okay, guys.  We'll see you next time.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you.  The Retard Laverne Show.  There they go.  All right.  There they go.  Bye.  Out and zing.  There they are.  Wow.  That Marion's a piece of ass.  Oh, Jesus.  Hubba hubba.  All right, Anthony.  We got to finish with the commercials here.  We'll check in with Stinky.  We'll play your brother Joe's song, and we'll get the hell out of here.  All right.  It's WNW.  This segment of Opie and Anthony is brought to you by Iceland Air Holidays.  Visit Icelandair.com and visit Iceland for as little as $299. 
[03:26:30]  There they go.  As far as we go.  I'm just getting this memory, watching them walk down the hallway.  You remember when you were a kid, and you really, like, had a crush on somebody, and you  might have been starting this relationship, and then you're hanging out with that person  all day, and then she's got to go.  Remember that feeling you got?  Like, you really were bummed, and you missed the person from the second they laughed and 
[03:27:00]  stuff?  I am so far from that feeling right now.  Holy Christ on a pony.  There are two lovely ladies, Anthony.  Where?  Where?  All right.  We got to check in with Stinky.  All right, man.  Stinky!  Oh, no.  Stinky!  Stinky! 
[03:27:30]  Stinky?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  They just...  They...  All right.  I'm getting...  I'm getting...  They're in Virginia?  I heard I'm a cop, you idiot.  Damn.  Yes.  We'll play a quick round of what do we learn, and hopefully Stinky will get a better sell.  Uh, Yanbag, what's going on?  Uh, yeah.  I learned that Amadou Diallo was shot 41-0, just like the Giants. 
[03:28:00]  Also, the Challenger always blows up in the matter how many times you watch it.  Uh, and at 420, the Cal zones always seem to disappear.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you, Yanbag.  Let's go to Box on line 2.  Don't we eat every day.  Yeah, what's up, Box?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I learned that the name of the newest show on WNEW is Sports Reefards.  They did well.  Sports Reefards!  Sports Reefards!  All right, let's go to Neil.  Neil, what's going on?  How you doing, guys? 
[03:28:30]  All right.  I learned that Lady Di must be pretty damn stupid if Marion is the brains of the operation.  It's like comparing an amoeba with a paramecium, my friend.  Oh, boy.  All right, thank you, Neil.  We've got to go back to Stinky, who's on the road to Mississippi.  Stinky!  Hey, guys, is this better?  Uh, a little better.  A little better?  All right.  Yeah, well, we just crossed the Mason-Dixon line.  Earl's been put in the back.  For Stacey and I'm in West Virginia.  You're in West Virginia.  They are moving. 
[03:29:00]  Stink?  Yeah.  You're in West Virginia?  I can't even hear you.  Just forget it.  I can't even hear you.  Just forget it.  Oh, man.  Well, they're obviously going to have to find places where they can stop and talk to us.  But we're not on until tomorrow at 2, at which time they should be very close, if not at their destination.  So we don't have to worry about that.  Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of stories to tell when we hit the radio tomorrow, live at 3.  Anyway, the overnight stories.  The overnight stories should be pretty good. 
[03:29:30]  Which will be on DAT and videotape, and we will watch.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I learned that LASIK surgery only lasts for one year.  And I also learned that Victoria's Secret has a big and tall shop.  Ah, very good.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Victoria's Secret should have been that they allow people like her in.  That's a secret they shouldn't get out.  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that Lady Di does not have back boobs.  Mm-hmm.  The retarded Vernon Shirley forgot their shovel when they went to the fight. 
[03:30:00]  And the Calzone is history when Stinky's Munchie set in.  All right.  You got stuck.  Talk later.  Thank you, Rich.  I learned drugs just don't kill the right people.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  I learned that today that after listening to those two effing retards, I had to inject  eight cc's of heroin into my retina.  Heroin doesn't even help, man.  I know.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Hey, can we try to get Stinky on one last time? 
[03:30:30]  Matt, what's up?  I learned that those two ladies should have fell into the bee event at the Budweiser plant,  and we'd all be fine.  Take care, guys.  All right.  I thought he was going to say that Lady Di didn't know her birthday.  She didn't know if she was 38 or 39.  Ernie-O.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I believe she knows.  What's up, Ernie?  Like that's going to make a difference.  Like that's going to make a difference.  Oh, wow.  She's 38.  Yeah.  Come here, then.  Come on.  Ernie-O.  Yeah.  Today I learned the vaudeville show on acid isn't as fun as it sounds. 
[03:31:00]  And my Sylvester impression is very, very good.  Good job, my friend.  Take care, guys.  All right, man.  There's Stinky.  I don't know.  Let's try.  All right, let's try Stinky one last time here.  Stinky.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  That's better.  All right.  Hey, nice.  All right.  We're probably at the top of a mountain now, so it might help.  Nice.  All right.  What's going on, Stinky?  Our last update for today.  We just passed a Cracker Barrel, which shows we're moving south. 
[03:31:30]  Okay.  And I don't know, not too much.  The fog has cleared up.  Uh-huh.  We're flying.  What's the mood in the vehicle, Stinky?  I'm just passing all the exits.  Yeah, I've been in that seat.  When you're driving and you don't have to take a leak, anyone in the car can effing wait.  Because I'm making good time.  I'm making good time.  Oh, he heard me complain, and he's pulling off.  He's pulling off.  Hey, Stinky, how's Earl doing? 
[03:32:00]  Earl's actually holding up.  Yeah?  You know, he's not bad.  No problems at all, except for that.  Khaleed Mohammed.  Yeah, yeah, he's threatening.  He's saying he's Khaleed Mohammed.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Took that turn, Pat.  Woo.  What?  What?  I don't know.  He just went off the exit, and we almost rolled over.  Oh, he made a hard turn.  Yeah.  So, I think we're going to stop.  We just got off in some town. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Taco Bell, Arby's, McDonald's.  We're going to go.  Yeah, McDonald's.  All right.  All right, so they're stopping for gas and food and a pee break.  Nothing much happening between last break, where we had a little bit of a crisis, and now?  Seems everyone's settling in.  But I predict problems.  Hey, Stink?  Yeah.  How's the calzone?  I actually haven't eaten the calzone yet.  All right.  Very good.  No matter what Dan from Hoboken told you, I did not eat the calzone. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Let's talk to Earl real fast.  All right.  Hold on.  Hello.  Hey, Earl.  What's happening?  Uh-oh.  You don't sound too excited.  Well, he's sounding a little bit uncomfortable.  They threw me in the back once we passed West Virginia.  Why?  Yeah.  They just said it was some type of safety precaution.  Well, you're in the South now.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong, Earl? 
[03:33:30]  Well, we just...  Idiots.  All right.  Other than me sitting in the back seat with my head down.  Are you going to try to make a statement and use the whites-only bathroom?  Hey, Earl.  Yes, I will try the whites-only bathroom.  Earl, are you really in the back with your head down?  Well, I'm flat on my back where we got all the stuff.  Yeah.  They're actually hiding them.  I guess it looks like I'm, you know, transporting a... 
[03:34:00]  They're transporting a passenger.  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  Let's check in with Dan from Hoboken, and then we're going to let you guys go.  All right.  We'll check in later.  All right.  Here's Dan.  All right.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Dan.  How you guys doing?  You tell us.  How's everyone holding up?  All right.  We're doing okay.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to live through the night, but...  No.  Are you okay?  Are you a little scared at Scott's driving?  I think between the onboard DVD, all the fog, and all the stack of two he's taken, I don't 
[03:34:30]  really think I'm going to live through.  And what sucks about that is the last woman I saw was Stalker Patty.  Oh, the last lady.  That's good.  You ever been in a car...  Yeah, the last woman I talked to.  ...when someone goes, hey, man, I'll give you a ride, something, one of your buddies or something,  and you get in the car with him, and after five seconds, you realize, oh, my God, this  guy drives like an effing maniac, and I'm going to die, but you can't say anything, because  then you look like the puss.  You can't be like, hey, dude, slow down.  You're like, no, it's cool to do 90 on the side streets.  Yeah, I'm with you, man. 
[03:35:00]  And you're just petrified that you're going to die, and then every time you see him, and  you get to the point where maybe people are driving somewhere, and he's driving, you're  just like, nah, it's okay, I'll take my own vehicle, man.  I'll take my own car.  Yeah, exactly.  That's how he drives, huh?  Yeah, the driving's not so bad.  It's the talking that's really getting to me.  Dan, you're documenting everything for us?  Yeah, I got a journal.  You got some good stuff so far?  I'm doing okay.  All right, good.  All right, Dan.  Well, have fun tonight, and put Stinky back in the line for us. 
[03:35:30]  Okay, cool.  Thank you, bud.  Later.  There goes Dan from Hoboken.  Hello.  What's up?  All right, Stinky.  All right, Stinky.  Yeah.  We want a full report tomorrow.  We got to go off the air, so.  Will do.  You guys should be close to Winona, Mississippi by the time we hit the airwaves tomorrow, so.  Yeah, I'll try to leave Ben a message in the middle of the night on his voicemail or whatever.  Oh, that'll be good.  You know what?  Yeah.  You should leave a few messages with Ben's voicemail.  Yeah.  No, I'm dead serious, because that'll be funny to play tomorrow on the show. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, no problem.  All right, cool.  You can say, hey, Ben.  Just every once in a while, just call up Ben's voicemail and go, Ben, it's two.  We're in the middle of nowhere.  You know, just checking in, all right?  Check in.  And definitely, if anything happens, you call up right away.  No problem.  All right, man.  All right, Stinky.  See you guys.  All right, there they go.  On their way to Winona, Mississippi.  Wynona to W-O-N-A.  And let's get the hell out of here.  We'll leave everybody with Joe Song.  Yeah.  I want to thank Q for stopping by, by the way.  Q, always a pleasure.  Thank you. 
[03:36:30]  Great job again.  Very much fun.  I want to thank the retarded Laverne and Shirley as well.  I was hoping for some new teens, but we got Laverne and Shirley.  Well, next time it happens, you can come up, man.  That's the luck of the draw.  I know.  We like when people that contribute to the show come in.  Q.  A good sign, though.  Seriously, Ant brought this up a long time ago.  If you see Jamaican Mike.  Yes.  Nice.  Now we can only say 99.9% of the time it's going to be nice.  That's true.  Because remember, he was here for the stalker Patty Anthony Limo show.  Oh, that's true.  But usually when Jamaican Mike is walking the hallways, that's when it's good, huh? 
[03:37:00]  Because we tell him when we're having the good shows.  He's got that radar, huh?  Well, we tell him downstairs when he's parking the cars.  He's like, dude, today's the day, and he's up here.  You don't see him today, right?  No.  See?  Mm-hmm.  All right, Ant.  Let's leave everyone with Joe's song.  Yep.  See you tomorrow.  Well, L.P. and Anthony were sitting and thinking about sending old stinky on a radio mission.  Go down south and check out WONP.  The boys decided to have some fun, so they got hand phones and ride shotgun. 
[03:37:30]  Y'all might know him better as Black Pearl.  When they left New York, everything was fine until they crossed that Mason-Dixon line.  That's when black Earl's face turned snowy white.  Three hicks in a truck with guns and beer says, check out the nigger and the skinny little queer.  I bet we could rail them like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  The good old boys, they put on their sheets, and Earl's eyes popped out like buckwheats from some old Little Rascal's episode. 
[03:38:00]  Earl said, stinky, those boys want to F us.  Sure do wish we had an Opie's Lexus.  Not this piece of crap that got us from Rent-A-Rick.  Old stinky figured better hit the gas.  He noticed the smell from Black Earl's pants.  Lord and Lord, the dude done crapped himself.  The hicks was gaining on him and looking meaner. 
[03:38:30]  Earl was making faces like Farina from that haunted house Little Rascal's episode.  Just about then, three tires popped.  They blew a rod and the car done stopped.  They took out the KY and started moving up.  Well, the truck was on him like flies on crap.  Earl tried pulling out some gangster rap.  Bubba said, my granny sounds blacker than you.  Well, they held Earl down and took off his pants.  And that's when they noticed that cranky ass. 
[03:39:00]  Bubba jumped up and puked on stinky shoes.  Well, stinky said, boys, now I've had enough.  He rolled up a joint and he took a puff.  Passed it off to Bubba, said, how about you?  Well, Bubba took a toad off of stinky's blood.  Where'd you learn to roll like that, you skinny run?  You twist him up just like my cousin Clam.  Well, stinky said, Clam's my cousin too.  And if you know what's good for you, 
[03:39:30]  you'll leave my leather cheerio alone.  Well, I'm your wife's sister's husband, brother's cousin-in-law.  And you're her husband, brother's sister's mother's cousin-in-law.  So I guess I can call you dad.  Well, Bubba said, boys, better give it a rest.  If I bang that boy and be incest.  And old Stimey's still got a stinking ass.  So next time O and A tell us to drive, we'll say F-U. 
[03:40:00]  I think we'll fly to Mississippi via aeroplane. </pre>
