<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts recounting humorous anecdotes: Opie's near-miss with bicyclists while driving through a large puddle, and his investments in the struggling American auto industry amidst potential government bailouts and union negotiations.  They also discussed antiquated "blue laws."  The conversation then shifted to the New York Islanders' hockey team and Opie's anger over Rick DiPietro's contract and performance.  The hosts announced that Robert Kelly, Jeffrey Ross, and D.L. Hughley would be guests, previewing upcoming segments featuring a "Robot Girl" story and a viral video of KFC employees bathing in a restaurant sinkâ€”described with extensive commentary focusing on the women's bodies.  Macaulay Culkin's sister's death was briefly mentioned.  Further discussion involved a humorous experience at a Chinese restaurant, a mis-translated sign in China, texting difficulties in Asian languages, and a detailed revisit of the KFC sink incident, again with focus on the women's appearances.  This was followed by discussion of a McDonald's billboard campaign targeting Starbucks and the Illinois governor's resemblance to a child star. Opie discussed his significant weight loss and the reactions it prompted, and the contrasting success of Bon Jovi's and The Police's reunion tours.  Opie then shared emotionally charged details from his therapy sessions, revealing childhood experiences and his nickname, "Spiff," leading to further personal anecdotes and discussion of the TV show "Secret Millionaire" and their views on wealth.

Comedian Robert Kelly joined the show, recounting a traumatic childhood involving his abusive stepfather.  He detailed multiple instances of violence, including self-defense with a knife at age 12.  This narrative was interwoven with humorous anecdotes about his nickname, his childhood use of a drive-in as a personal cinema, and his tendency to cry during emotionally charged TV shows. The conversation then shifted to top-grossing concert acts of 2008, including commentary on Celine Dion and Madonna.  A segment of listener-submitted "F.U." messages was played.  The segment concluded with Kelly vomiting on air after viewing a disturbing video.  Jeffrey Ross's presence in the studio was also noted, along with mentions of Kelly's comedy album's iTunes chart position and an unfinished radio contest.

Jeffrey Ross then recounted his experience on *Dancing with the Stars*, detailing a cornea injury sustained during rehearsals, his performance with an eye patch, his surprisingly high score, and his elimination.  He described a prank by Cousin Sal and his highly viewed roast after his elimination.  Ross detailed further injuries, including a broken hip and a finger injury from a .50 caliber Desert Eagle (footage of which was shown), and his recent hair transplant surgery.  The show then featured a discussion of a Pal Talk user, "Pathetic Male Slave," and concluded with Bob Kelly filling in for Jim Norton, a humorous exchange with intern David about his perceived entitlement, a discussion about Hanukkah versus Christmas, a debate on different faiths' versions of heaven, and a brief musical performance by intern David.

A 38-year-old intern, Scott Como, who left his job as an electrician for radio, was then interviewed. The hosts joked about his life choices, his radio name possibilities, his NFL team allegiance, and his physique.  They then shared graphic accounts of Bobby and Patrice O'Neal's experiences in Amsterdam's Red Light District, followed by sexually explicit discussions of sex tourism in Amsterdam and Brazil.  D.L. Hughley joined the show, and the conversation turned to his experiences on CNN, the O.J. Simpson trial, and current events, often incorporating highly offensive and racially charged humor. The discussion covered graphic sexual acts, personal hygiene, physical abuse, and the election of Barack Obama, all laced with profanity, offensive stereotypes, and crude humor. The segment ended with further ribbing of the intern and increasingly aggressive interactions with another studio employee ("Sam").

A prolonged, highly vulgar prank on intern David followed.  The hosts and another on-air personality relentlessly teased and verbally abused him, using copious profanity, particularly "motherfucker," attempting to goad him into aggression, and making crude jokes about his lack of fighting experience and perceived virginity. A female listener called in, leading to a bizarre group hug.  The focus shifted to sending David to a massage parlor, with graphic descriptions of the services offered and instructions on how to interact with the workers, continuing jokes at David's expense.

The show's final segment began with a discussion of a friend's messy bathroom habits, followed by comments about an MSNBC news reporter's appearance and speculation on a missing person case (Kaylee's body was later found).  Crude comments about the reporter and other women were made.  Discussion of David leaving the office, described as a potential disaster, led to a comedic, vulgar anecdote about his impending strip club visit.  The conversation became increasingly sexually explicit, detailing masturbation and sexual encounters.  Caller Robert recounted losing a diamond from his wedding ring, prompting more sexually charged discussions.  Attractive female caller Lily, an intern for the Ron & Fez show, joined, leading to a conversation heavily focused on sexually explicit topics and offensive language towards various racial and ethnic groups. The segment concluded with more vulgar jokes and announcements about upcoming appearances and the end of the show,  including further discussions of sending David to a strip club with Lily.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Let's get the show on the road. Good morning, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi!  How are you, Anthony?  Very good. You sure?  Yeah, it was a pleasant drive-in with the rain.  People apparently think it's a meteor shower when they drive in and don't want to get hit by anything, so they drive it two miles an hour.  I understand. Even I can't drive like I usually do in the rain, because the rain does make the road a little more slick, but it's not ice. 
[00:00:30]  I think that's what people are thinking, because it's December, well, this has to be black ice.  It's got to be that black ice.  No, it's still kind of warm.  It's water falling from the sky. That's what windshield wipers are for.  Yeah.  And get out of the way.  Yeah.  It's all I can say is, get the hell out of the way.  Oh, last night driving home, I nailed two people on bicycles going down the sidewalk. 
[00:01:00]  You might want to explain.  I didn't mean it, but no, no, not that bad.  I didn't actually hit them.  There was a giant puddle.  Yeah.  One of those where your vehicle goes...  Going through it, and you feel like you're in a boat.  Yeah.  And I sent a tsunami onto them.  Just a tsunami.  Why were they on bikes to begin with? 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  They're on bicycles going down the sidewalk.  So I assume they're probably wet anyway.  Who cares?  Yeah.  But it's just an insult.  Even if you're wet, to just get that wave of tire water on you is just insulting.  Dirt and water.  Yeah, yeah.  The dirt stays.  Just horrid.  When it happens to you, you feel so helpless.  Yeah.  Because you really want to beat someone up.  And you just see those taillights going further away knowing there's nothing you can do about it. 
[00:02:00]  There's absolutely nothing you can do.  It is fun to do.  Not fun to be on the receiving end, though.  Is it as fun as playing the stock market, Anthony, huh?  You know, yesterday I was saying...  You were being a braggart.  No, no.  I wasn't being a braggart.  I had optimism that perhaps the government bailout of the big three automakers would happen.  You know?  It passed in, what, the Senate? 
[00:02:30]  The House.  The House, yeah.  It got close.  And then the Senate.  Real close.  The Senate said no.  Said no.  And yesterday I'm looking going, I should probably bail out.  I should probably punch out today.  And then I'm thinking, you know, I bought this thinking I'm just going to hold it, regardless of what happens.  Because a year from now, you know, something will be, whether they're bankrupt or they're in good shape again.  So I'll just hold it. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, but your logic used to work in the year 2000 when everybody was day trading.  Yeah.  Now there's no logic to this Wall Street thing.  No.  None whatsoever.  None whatsoever.  Today I have kind of a bad feeling about that.  Did you go in large?  No, no, which is good.  I didn't really go in that large.  Because I hadn't really screwed around with my E-Trade account in quite a while. 
[00:03:30]  So I was just like, let me fire this thing back up and get back into it a little bit and have some fun.  And oof, oof, I don't know what's going to happen.  You picked the wrong sector to begin fooling around with your account again.  No, no.  It's actually, it was a good idea.  At the time.  Based on.  A mere three days ago.  Based on a bailout.  And I was, you know, up until we see what happens today, I was ahead.  Oh, you're going to be so down today.  Because I completely, I got lucky buying at the complete bottom of the two companies. 
[00:04:00]  But, you know, you can never tell what's going to happen in the stupid stock market.  So who the hell knows?  I happen to believe.  Do I hear a little optimism in your voice?  Yeah, because I really do believe that the government's not going to let the American automakers go down the crapper.  I really don't think they're going to let that happen.  But they had a problem because the unions, again, they don't want to give concessions. 
[00:04:30]  They wanted these concessions built into this loan that they're giving them, saying, you know, you're going to have to take some pay cuts.  And then the unions are like, well, and then the Republicans that support the unions, they're like, no, no, no.  Because you don't want a pay cut?  How about a job cut, dummies?  Would they rather have a pay cut or they're all going to be sitting on their ass with no jobs?  Or maybe the unions know what they're doing.  Maybe the unions know that the government has to bail out the car makers.  At some point, right.  So they're sitting there like, hell, they have to do this eventually. 
[00:05:00]  We're not going to, you know, take a pay cut.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  Because it sounds kind of dumb for them to say no with the risk of losing their jobs.  So I think they're looking at the bigger picture that the government has to do this.  Well, you know something?  That's a pretty big gamble on their part because they could all be sitting home with no jobs and we'll just be buying Japanese cars and that'll be that.  And that's that.  It's a weird situation.  But I don't know.  I happen to think that something will happen and they will get bailed out in some way, shape or form. 
[00:05:30]  Or they'll have to make their own cuts in a way that's, you know, painful for them.  But it keeps the company going.  We'll see.  It's just getting ugly out there.  Ugly.  What is it?  Bank of America laying off 35,000 people today?  Or in the next couple?  Three years.  Oh, in the next three years they're laying off their...  Ah, okay.  And they own...  So they spread that crap out a little bit, huh? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, they do own everything.  And then we're all over the place, but we're just getting started.  The news did a story on blue laws.  I don't understand this.  They were basically saying in these tough economic times, which you hear probably a hundred times a day now.  Yeah.  People can't shop at certain malls on Sundays.  Is that true?  Certain townships and communities.  What is that about?  They still have things called blue laws. 
[00:06:30]  And it means on Sundays all the stores are closed.  There are blue laws up in Massachusetts when the liquor stores were closed on Sunday.  And, you know, you'd have to drive up because Saturday night after midnight, they consider it Sunday because it technically is.  And you couldn't get any booze.  Yeah.  So you'd have to drive out of state, which is a great idea because you've been drinking till 12.  Now you've got to get in your car drunk and drive out of state to bring more booze back. 
[00:07:00]  To get some hair of the dog that bit you.  For this archaic, religious-based law.  So it is based on religion?  Totally.  Who's religion?  Totally based on some Christian bull.  That's one of ours?  It was a puritanical thing.  It meant to prevent you from doing anything like gambling, drinking, bad stuff on a Sunday.  So they outlawed all those businesses.  Guess what?  You should be in church.  You shouldn't be shopping.  Absolutely.  You should be praising the Lord. 
[00:07:30]  You shouldn't be drinking.  Amen.  Well, guess what?  The Lord's not going to turn around this economic mess we're in.  Let the people shop.  We need to pump the money into the economy.  Yeah.  Enough with the dumb blue laws.  When are you supposed to go to a mall?  Tuesday?  Yeah.  On a Tuesday?  Sunday is when you get to shop because you're not working.  It's a huge mall in Bergen County.  Shuts down.  It's absolutely vacant on Sunday.  That's great.  The store on...  Do they get a break?  Do they only have to pay six days' worth of rent every month? 
[00:08:00]  Well, that sucks.  That's a day.  They figure it out where it's only six days' worth of rent.  You know, they are just burning their money on that day that they're not allowed to open.  Unbelievable.  You just...  Who's still...  It's archaic.  Archaic.  But since you gave me a little jab about the stock there, Opie, I would like to say...  Are you jabbing me back?  How about those Islanders?  They won last night, though.  Oh, they certainly did. 
[00:08:30]  Did they?  What?  Nine-to-two trouncing.  I was peering in on the game because I was out last night, and all I could think is,  oh, my God.  They allowed two people to get hat tricks.  Did my brother have the game on at FH?  No, I was over at the bar next door.  Oh, the competition.  Thank you.  FH had a little private party going on.  I think I'm going to go do a show with Scott Shannon.  What the hell?  Thanks for the support.  Jesus.  My first choice was FH. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  As long as it was your first choice.  I parked in the back like I usually do.  I walked in.  I saw a big buffet thing set up.  Nice.  I'm like, wow, this is going to be good.  And then they said, you know, the lovely Holly told me, no, apparently there's a party going on.  Yeah.  So you could hang out for a little bit.  So I had a few beers over there, and then we went next door.  And, you know, they have the TVs up there, so the Islander game was on.  It was just...  How about we not talk about how great the other bar is?  Oh, God.  Big screen TVs. 
[00:09:30]  There was this cool area with couches.  It was amazing.  You suck.  Yeah, the Islanders got a beating last night, 9-2.  A couple of the penguins were able to squeak some hat tricks out of...  They had to sweep the ice off a couple of times for the hats that were flying off.  Just abominable.  My hockey team's a disaster.  We signed DiPietro for 15 years. 
[00:10:00]  You don't sign any player for 15 years.  15 years?  What are you thinking?  Well, by that time, they figured there'll be cybernetic devices to improve his health, his legs.  And I've lost track.  Since they signed him to 15 years, he's had operations on both hips, both knees, I believe.  And he's got some kind of mystery thing that they don't really want to talk about.  Like, he can't get healthy.  He wants to go find alternative treatment in other countries. 
[00:10:30]  This is our goalie that we signed for 15 years of one of these, quote, franchise players.  You shouldn't sign anyone in a major sport to 15 years.  It's stupid.  Four goals in the first period.  Dude, we have, like, minor league goalies, basically.  Because then our...  You want to talk hockey?  We'll talk hockey.  We had a really good backup, this Dubowitz.  And Dubowitz is like, I'm not playing anytime soon.  You got DiPietro for 15 years, and I want to play him pretty good.  But I'm simplifying it, obviously. 
[00:11:00]  So they got rid of him.  And he would have been a star this year.  Yeah.  Anybody would have put something in there.  We have no goalie.  That's the problem.  We're out shooting a lot of these teams and losing the games.  Not last night.  The last game I went to was the Atlanta Thrashers and the Islanders.  Atlanta had about...  People are better with the stats than me, because I hate sports radio for two minutes and then enough.  But the Thrashers had something like 17 shots on goal, scored five times. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  That's just ridiculous.  And the Islanders, we were like 30, 40 shots on goal, something like that, and lost the game.  Just ridiculous.  Yeah, last night was just a...  9-2, though, huh?  Well, you still got him for 13 more years.  He could get healthy.  Yeah.  He's only two years into his 15-year contract.  They could come up with something.  And, you know, they only spent 67.5 million dollars.  There you go. 
[00:12:00]  Damn.  So another team I get to watch for years, and they don't do nothing.  With no results.  Just like my Knicks, just like the Mets who choke every year, and the Jets, you know.  They've been kind of wobbling a little bit the last couple of weeks.  Wobbling.  They've been wobbling a bit.  Yeah.  So thanks for rubbing it in.  Was it really two hat tricks?  Because I'll tell you what happened.  I was playing Tiger Woods Golf Online, and then I took a peek at the game, and it was ugly already. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, all right, there's no reason to watch this.  It went ugly real fast.  No, I know the final was 9-2, but it was two hat tricks?  Was it really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two hat tricks.  A couple of the penguins.  Yeah.  Well, they've got a pretty strong young team.  All right, we're just getting started.  We've got Robert Kelly coming in today.  Bobby.  Do we have Jeffrey Ross coming in today?  Yes, we do.  Jeff's coming in.  From Dancing with the Stars.  He was a big hit with Dancing with the Stars.  Lasted a week.  Oof.  But they brought him back to do a roast at the end of the year. 
[00:13:00]  I saw that while I was away.  And kind of a new friend of ours.  I mean, he's been doing the show pretty regularly.  D.L. Hughley will be stopping in today.  Cool, yeah.  He's got that really cool show on CNN Headlines, or is it CNN Headlines?  Oh, on the regular CNN.  Okay, cool.  We'll talk about that and other things.  But it's Opie and Anthony.  877-212-ON-A.  When we get back, we're going to talk about Robot Girl.  We kind of started talking about this yesterday.  Yeah, yesterday.  And the guy that's programming this thing is just a creep. 
[00:13:30]  More details on this creep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  And also, you know, we weren't even going to touch on the story, but it's got legs.  The Kentucky Fried Chicken thing with the girls in the sink.  In the sink.  Well, like, they're just ripping off the dude that did it at Burger King.  Yeah.  And the paper doesn't understand what they were...  We'll explain after the break.  They look a little chubby.  Yeah, but they got Young Chubb on them.  Yeah, yeah.  Young Chubb is easy.  Young Chubb is easy to deal with.  Young Chubb is better than Old Thin. 
[00:14:00]  No, yeah.  Yeah, Old Thin has the ligaments.  Yeah.  The younger broads don't have the ligaments.  Unless they're flat-sews, but the one chick didn't look like a flat-sew.  I don't mind the Young Chubb.  Young Chubb...  Seems odorless.  Seems just kind of fun.  Yeah.  Just kind of fun.  Smooth.  Right.  Young Chubb.  877-212-08.  Just getting started.  That's not good.  There we go. 
[00:14:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Man, you hear about Macaulay Culkin's sister?  Yeah, what the hell happened there?  Dead.  At 29 years old, Dakota McCulkin.  Yikes.  I'm trying to figure out what street in L.A., but she decided to kind of cross the street.  And there were, like, crosswalks.  Yeah.  But she blew those off and went in between two crosswalks, I guess.  Uh, we all do that, though, so.  You gotta, like, really look, though. 
[00:15:00]  I, uh, I usually cross the street in between, uh, intersections.  Yeah.  Of course.  You're gonna cross the street, get to your car, whatever the hell.  But, uh, man, you gotta, like, slowly peek out between parked cars, and some people just  walk, uh, I'm amazed when I'm driving that people will just walk out in front of your  moving vehicle like nothing.  That's not a white thing, I hate to say it.  Huh?  It's not a white thing.  No, I don't.  To walk right in front of, uh, cars. 
[00:15:30]  I'll tell you where.  That are speeding down the street.  Let me tell you where the worst place in Manhattan to drive is, uh, if, if you don't  want to hit somebody, don't go to, um, uh, Chinatown.  People in Chinatown will walk right out in front of your cars.  It's, it amazes me.  Like, it's the worst place in Manhattan to drive and, uh, uh, almost hit people.  Constantly.  And it's usually some elderly person that will just step right off that curb in front 
[00:16:00]  of your car.  Wow, I have five jokes.  Oh, I have 20.  I have at least five.  Yes.  And you're the funny man, so of course you got 20, but I got five easy ones.  Easy.  Uh, that we cannot, uh, use.  What are you doing in Chinatown?  Uh, I used to drive down there.  Um, you know, I had friends that lived, uh, lived down there.  Right.  Uh, but yeah, you drive through there and it just insanity.  I, uh, last time I was in Chinatown, I went to a Chinese restaurant and this is, you want 
[00:16:30]  to talk about like, uh, like racism.  My God.  Oh no.  I think I told the story a few times.  Went there with a bunch of people, sat in a Chinese restaurant and noticed no one was  taking care of us and they slowly but surely waited on us.  And as this was happening, um, Asians were coming in this door.  Like it was not families and couples and then people that are on dates and whatever.  And slowly but surely they took care of us. 
[00:17:00]  And the meal took probably two to three times longer than it should have.  Oh.  And we're sitting there.  It was a good conversation.  So at first we're like, whatever.  But then it did get to the point like, what the F is this about?  Turns out I asked a bunch of people after the fact, uh, because it's such a tourist trap,  you know, the Asians down there, they had decided some restaurants for the tourists.  The other restaurants are for us and our community.  Yeah.  But they can't officially say that on the door outside.  So if you do walk into one of these places, you know, they don't want to get in trouble, 
[00:17:30]  I guess, with the city.  They will serve you at their pace.  Yeah.  And then you as the customer will go, wow, I'm never going back there again.  And you're doing exactly what they want you to do.  Not go back.  And spreading the word.  And spreading the word.  Go to that place.  And if I could pronounce the restaurant, I would spread the word and tell you not to  go there.  How could you pronounce it?  Are we allowed to say that one at least?  Yeah.  You know, because I don't speak Chinese.  It was in Chinese.  Of course not.  877-212-01A.  What, uh, Danny told me a really funny story about, um, uh, was it Danny or Travis? 
[00:18:00]  I get you guys mixed up sometimes.  About the translation during the Olympics in, uh, China.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Uh, basically during the Olympics, all these, uh, restaurants and shops down in China were trying  to translate their, their signs into English to try and generate more business.  Yeah.  You know, you can't walk around in China and look at the signs and go, you know, I don't  know what this store is.  Right.  So if it's, uh, a store that, uh, sells, I don't know, cell phones, you know, it would  be the, uh, Asian writing up there, but then they'd put, you know, cell phones, they'd translate 
[00:18:30]  it so that people would know that you could walk in there.  Huh.  And, uh, apparently, uh, well, this, uh, I guess this one store, they, they really didn't  dig too deep to try and translate their sign.  And I guess they went to one of these free, like web-based, uh, translation engines and  typed in their, their name.  So they have the sign printed up and there's a picture.  I guess we'll link it to onaradio.com for later.  Yeah.  Uh, and it's some, some, some Chinese characters. 
[00:19:00]  And then in English, it says translate server error.  That's what the, that's what it would mean in English.  Well, they actually put the sign up.  Right.  Right.  Translate server error.  And that's the name of the restaurant.  Because that's what popped up when they went to translate it, there was an error.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And instead of checking into it, they just had a big sign printed up that said translate  server error and popped it up in front of their store.  Yeah.  Somebody had a great comment.  I don't know if it was this blog or a different one, but one of the comments said, can't wait  to go eat it. 
[00:19:30]  Uh, uh, error 404 is later.  Something I've always thought about as far as Asians go.  How do they text?  Uh, oh, I, it's gotta be in English.  I guess.  No, I'm talking when they're texting and.  Oh, in, in, in their home, uh, in their home language.  How do they do that?  We have what?  26 letters.  Don't they have like a, a million or something?  How the hell?  Perhaps more than that.  How the hell do you get all that on a phone?  And how do you text?  I don't know.  I, it's probably, um, uh, texting, uh, like whole chunks of, of what you're trying to 
[00:20:00]  say.  Right.  You know, some languages do that.  Like one symbol means a whole bunch of stuff.  Yeah.  And then maybe it's like that.  That's crazy.  I am so ill informed as far as the Asian language goes, uh, as far as certain, certain Asian  languages go.  Yeah.  Who is?  And characters and stuff.  I know.  That's probably a hundred people listening to us right now that might know a few words  in, in Chinese or Japanese.  You could, no, you could listen to Spanish or French, German, Italian. 
[00:20:30]  And just because there's some kind of similarity, you can kind of pick out a word or two.  Sure.  Uh, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, anything like that.  You just lost.  Yeah.  Right from the start.  There's nothing you're going to go, oh, I know that means car because it doesn't sound  anything like it.  See, I should have went with my original line.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  We're thinking the same today, Steven.  And Opie, Asian phones are 17 square feet wide. 
[00:21:00]  That's, I was going to make a very large phone joke because they have so many characters  to choose from.  Hey, John Lou, is this break okay for you?  We didn't get too nasty.  Yikes with this.  Was this okay?  Or are you going to like rally the troops against us?  Maybe the Asians could call up and say it was okay that, you know, that we discussed  a few Asian things that we don't understand.  Hope it was all right with you.  John.  He's trying to learn. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, the KFC story has legs.  It's on Drudge Report.  By the way, we've tried to...  Big fat legs.  We've tried to get John Lou on our show just to discuss why we're not really allowed to  make fun of Asians with him raising holy hell.  Yeah.  Because all the other groups we make fun of, they seem to have no problem with it.  Yeah.  They know we're just kind of like spreading it around.  Jokes.  You know?  Jokes.  The KFC story.  We have the original story.  Some dude at Burger King.  Was it a Burger King?  These fast food restaurants get mad when you think it's one and it's the other. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I don't think they would mind if it wasn't their restaurant.  But, yeah, he decided to fill up that big sink.  Right.  And I guess they washed some of the dishes in and take a little bath in it.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  The original story.  Employee takes a bath in Burger King's sink.  Yeah.  Sure.  So, what happened here was these girls, I mean, they're probably a bit savvy, saw that  video or saw that news story somewhere and said, you know what?  Why don't we do this? 
[00:22:30]  Put it on our MySpace and our friends will see.  It'll be kind of fun and whatever.  People love it.  Yeah.  And the news is taking the stand that these girls are dumb and don't they realize they  would get fired for this?  I don't think the girls cared if they got fired for this.  They were having some fun.  No.  And wanted some crazier pictures up on their MySpace page.  Simple as that.  Well, they got them.  So, what's the story?  They decided to just take a bath in the sink at the KFC Inn?  Yeah, it looks like they stripped down. 
[00:23:00]  They look like they're in their brassieres.  Yeah.  And they're bathing.  What are the three of them in there at one point?  How big are these sinks?  They got chubziers on.  They are some chubby, chubby girls.  I mean, a regular girl would call it a broad.  These girls have like chubziers.  Like, it's holding in chub.  Chubz.  I don't know if they're officially boobies or not.  They look cushy, though.  Don't they look cushy squeezing out of the top?  Oh, yeah.  Because they're little fatties. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're definitely dipping into the product.  You think?  And this one girl's, this photo, I'm looking at a photo of one girl hugging another girl.  Yeah.  And she's taking a picture.  And look at her arm.  A bit on the big side.  No, that is an arm that you put in the deep fryer and then take a big tender bite out of.  Yeah, I think these chubziers were pretty brave to be naked in a restaurant kitchen.  Yeah.  You know, there's a risk of being dropped into the deep fryer. 
[00:24:00]  But this is, how old are they, 17 years old?  Girls listed herself as 17 years old.  Yeah, they're young chub, Ant.  Young chub is okay, like we were saying before the break.  I am a KFC worker.  They are my best friends and my family, she says.  Ah!  The photos appeared, which appeared to have been posted late last month, showed the girls  bathing in the deep commercial sink and posing in their underwear and swimwear. 
[00:24:30]  Hmm.  And, yeah, they, some of them are making those MySpace faces where it makes you kind of look  better.  Yeah, it's called MySpace voodoo.  MySpace voodoo.  They're kind of just...  You take the picture from above.  If you're going to, like, take your own picture, you don't go straight on if you have a little  chub.  You go up here, raise the camera nice and high, look up.  She's turning, one is turning her head and kind of looking up through the corner of her  eyes at the camera, which makes her look kind of hot.  Mm-hmm.  And then you turn the page and realize, no, she kind of looks like a mongoloid. 
[00:25:00]  Would you, though?  Oh, yeah.  Out of the three, would you?  Out of the three, the one with the darkest hair.  That's it?  Well, the other one, the one with the big fat arm, no way.  That would be a little rough, but...  And then the other one, yeah, okay, so there's two out of three.  I would go all three.  No, not that one.  I really would go all three just because of the young chub factor.  Not that, young chub, you get a lot of mileage with young chub, but not that one. 
[00:25:30]  Well, the problem with the girl with the really big arm, she has, like, no boobs whatsoever.  Here's the story.  Tonight, three Kentucky Fried Chicken employees in Northern California have been suspended for  bathing in a restaurant kitchen sink.  What?  Pictures from one of the women's MySpace pages in an album called KFC Moments.  New problem.  The photo show the women in provocative poses in one of the deep sinks.  New problem.  New problem. 
[00:26:00]  Actually, you used to clean the dishes there.  Well, the CD player has decided not to stop anymore.  Pictures were taken one night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  It's just going and going.  I try to stop that about 20 times.  New problem.  You know, you blow those pictures up and put them in color, and those girls are just un-effable.  Something to be said about black and white, huh?  Yeah, I'm looking at that picture now, and the one that I said I would have, that head  of hers is beyond bizarre. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know what's happening with her head.  The other one looks like a dock worker.  The one on the far left, perhaps.  She's all right.  As I look.  The one in the middle has the Christina Ricci forehead.  Wow.  She's got the big forehead.  Yeah, but not the rest of Christina Ricci, though.  No.  Without the Ricci part.  Yes.  She's, ugh.  Tonight, three Kentucky Fried Chicken employees in Northern California have been suspended for 
[00:27:00]  bathing in a restaurant kitchen sink.  That's crazy.  Pictures from one of the women's MySpace pages in an album called KFC Moments.  The photos show the women in provocative poses in one of the deep sinks, actually used to  clean the dishes there.  Ah.  The manager says the pictures were taken one night at closing time.  They have been reprimanded and suspended.  I love how they go with the fake, oh my God moment, where they wash the dishes there. 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  So?  Oh my goodness.  If you're going into a KFC and, you know, whatever.  I don't think you're concerned much about your health.  So if some young bitches want to bathe in the sink, I really don't think that's the biggest  problem you have.  Because they're probably all nice and, you know, well clothed.  Yeah.  And stuff, so you don't have to worry about having to go with, you know, the chicken. 
[00:28:00]  Sure.  And what's the harm?  What's the harm?  What's the harm?  Nice.  Well, it's no big deal.  No, it's one of those goofy things that these wacky kids do.  Yeah.  All right.  It gets them a little press.  Look at that.  The talk of their schools, I'm sure.  Speaking of, I guess, fast food joints, you got to applaud McDonald's today. 
[00:28:30]  I don't even know if they advertise.  I don't know who advertised with the show.  I don't know if KFC does and we just lost that account.  I don't know.  It's a good story.  We're going with it.  Yeah.  But McDonald's is going after Starbucks and Starbucks won't slug it out in Ad Wars.  But basically, here's the story.  There's a billboard that McDonald's erected at the Starbucks headquarters.  Yeah.  Declaring four bucks is dumb. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  How great is that?  Four bucks is dumb.  Obviously, talking about, you know, paying four dollars for a cup of coffee is ridiculous.  When you can go in and get what?  Well, they've upped their coffee.  Did they?  At McDonald's and these other places.  Yeah.  They're all trying to compete with what Starbucks has started.  Absolutely, they have.  I haven't had a cup of coffee from anywhere, really.  But McDonald's in years.  The biggest thing McDonald's was famous for for their coffee was burning people's crotches for a while. 
[00:29:30]  That was all they were known for as far as their coffee goes.  Yeah.  They figured out the temperature and they figured out how to, you know, brew a nice cup of coffee.  And they keep the cost down.  And you know what?  I'm with McDonald's on this.  They've been sneaking up that Starbucks price on us here and there.  And next thing you know, you go in there with a couple bucks going, I can get a cup of coffee.  No.  No.  But do they have the variety?  I'm not really sure.  I would assume they do.  Do they have the little machine? 
[00:30:00]  According to the billboard, four bucks is dumb.  Now serving espresso, McDonald's.  I'm loving it.  Are dummies protesting?  Are dummies protesting for the word dumb being used?  Oh, probably.  I bet somebody will complain that they don't want like the word dumb up there because it's just a bad word.  Right.  That means, you know, you should use some other word like mentally challenged.  Like someone's going to be mad at that. 
[00:30:30]  It's like a clever sign, but you can't do that in this day and age.  They should just change the billboard to four bucks is Pete Rose.  It's Moe haircut.  It's Moe haircut.  Photo runer.  Yeah.  Another billboard slogan jabs.  Large is the new grande.  Oh, right.  So you're just going to give me a large cup.  I'm that guy.  I don't play with their stupid rules with them.  And I just go, look, give me a small coffee.  You mean a?  No, I don't mean a.  I mean a small coffee.  Small, medium, and large.  What is a small and tall? 
[00:31:00]  Tall.  Yeah.  Small.  They go, you mean a tall?  I go, no, I don't.  I mean a small.  No, I said small.  Small.  The smallest cup of coffee that you can deliver me, do that.  You mean a tall?  No, I don't mean a tall.  And when you just go back and forth.  I'm not speaking your language.  You know, that.  Who wants to say venti?  Give me a cup of coffee.  I'm late for work.  People behind you are getting all angry and they will kill you.  I used to be the biggest fan of Starbucks because I'm a, everyone knows around here,  I'm a coffeeaholic.  I drink coffee the entire show. 
[00:31:30]  And they were doing a good thing for a really long time.  But I'm not as impressed with their product anymore.  And everybody else is catching up and their coffee costs less.  It was popular for like 10 minutes to go in there and blurt out a big, long order  with all these stupid coffee-related, snobby coffee-related words.  Now it's just like, give me a large with some goddamn cool whip on top or whatever you're  putting on there.  They should take a page from McDonald's and have the numbering system.  Give me a number two. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Give me the number two coffee thing there you got on the big board.  With pictures on the cash register.  Yeah, exactly.  Dummies can use it.  That's pretty cool that they put that billboard up.  Yeah, it's a little ballsier than I would think a McDonald's would be.  It's like a radio billboard.  Yeah.  A radio stunt.  They're having a war.  A coffee war.  Coffee wars.  Let's say hi to Pete in Chicago.  Hey, Pete. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, what's up, man?  How do you say that guy's name up there?  No one can say it right.  Bogoyevich.  Bogoyevich?  Bogoyevich.  That seems pretty easy to say.  Yeah.  Well, it's spelled weird, but they just call him Blago or use the first five letters or whatever.  You know, before you say what you're going to say, I was telling Ant before the show,  it was bothering me, this Bogoyevich.  I'm like, he looks like someone.  He looks like someone that was driving me nuts, and I finally figured it out. 
[00:33:00]  He looks like a kid star that grew up.  Yeah.  He's got like a child star look.  He looks like he still has a little kid face.  Yeah, in 1980, he was all over NBC.  He was like the cute little kid for one of those horrendous sitcoms.  Precocious little kid on the show.  Right, right.  Had a catchphrase.  Might have been a little smarter than the adults, you know.  Of course.  You know how that is.  Perhaps the guy from WKRP wanted to touch him in an episode.  What do you got, Pete? 
[00:33:30]  Well, just to back you up a little bit, the thing about the Kentucky Fried Chicken,  you know, you're talking about the girls washing or getting in the sink that they wash the dishes in.  Yeah.  When's the last time you got a dish at Kentucky Fried Chicken?  Yeah, you know what?  We should have mentioned that.  Yeah, exactly.  You throw it all away when you leave.  What are they washing?  What do they wash?  The trays and the frying things? 
[00:34:00]  What are they washing?  All that grease?  I haven't had a clean tray of Kentucky Fried Chicken in a while either.  Hey, they don't like you calling it Kentucky Fried Chicken.  That just shows your age, my friend.  It's KFC.  It's KFC because they don't want Fried in their name anymore.  But they don't want to lose the branding, so they go with KFC.  That's the whole reason.  Yep.  They popped it down to that.  Well, it's our new national flag anyway, correct?  Yes, KFC.  All right.  Thanks, Pete.  Isn't that so odd they do that? 
[00:34:30]  Take Fried out.  No, we can't.  All right, then just turn it into KFC.  People won't know the F is for Fried.  Right, and eventually people will just forget it.  It'll be known as KFC.  It's KFC, and people still eat it and clog up their arteries.  All right.  Robert Kelly joining the program next.  Bobby.  Looking really thin.  People are going to start thinking you're anorexic.  You know that, right?  That's what's going to happen with you.  They need to say, what's wrong with you, Bobby?  You went from really large to you're almost thinner than me now, which is crazy. 
[00:35:00]  And now people are going to say you're either anorexic or you're sick.  Something's wrong with Bobby.  You know you're going to get that, right?  I've been getting it already.  Already.  I'm sure.  All right, we'll talk to Bobby next.  877-212-01A.  Opie and Anthony.  What's up, peeps?  Opie and Anthony.  Want to say hi to Robert Kelly.  RobertKellyLive.com.  We'll start with that plug for Bobby.  I had a quickie. 
[00:35:30]  Bon Jovi.  Top grossing tour of 2008.  Beating out the police with their comeback tour?  No way.  Travis, do a little research on that.  Why aren't the police?  Why aren't the police the number one tour of 2008 with that big comeback tour they did?  I would absolutely see Bon Jovi beating the police.  Really?  The police is a little more niche than Bon Jovi.  Yeah, but the police were playing for the first time in, I don't know, what was it, 20 years  or something?  On Jovi?  More than 20 years. 
[00:36:00]  Doesn't seem to be ending.  Oh, and your favorite musician came in second.  Oh.  Bruce Springsteen.  It books a week.  It's like Giant Stadium and it sells out every night.  I just personally don't get it.  I understand there are so many Bruce fans, but I just, I don't get it.  I was listening to a little Thunder Road the other day going, you know what?  I kind of like the Thunder Road.  As you go down to Asbury Park and the Jersey Shore. 
[00:36:30]  It's like, all right, working class guy, we get it.  Is that a Jersey accent?  I don't know.  No, it's Anne Springsteen.  Bruce is just, and everyone starts, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It does suck.  Oh, yeah, it's Bruce.  I imagine these tough economic times.  You got to ring the bell every time we say it or it's mentioned on the news.  Tough economic times. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, because that's what you hear every day now.  During these tough economic times, I would assume that the people need someone like Bruce  Springsteen to sing about the struggles out there.  Yeah, no kidding.  How about you sell a few of your houses and spread the wealth with your fans?  You see that show that's doing that?  Yeah.  Is it good?  Let me tell you something.  Millionaire or something like that?  I wish I never went to therapy because now I can't even walk.  I just cry.  Oh, Bobby.  Baby.  It's awful. 
[00:37:30]  You're me when I was like seven and eight.  And you're me when I was seven and eight.  Now we just switch roles.  I was just a dirt ball.  I was just a cry baby.  Trying to bag all the women.  Drinking booze.  Playing with guns.  No wonder.  What's the concept of the show?  They take a millionaire, like a legitimate millionaire guy, and they stick him in these, you know,  last night they put him in a shelter and then a battered women's shelter and then some aging  lady with her kid who didn't have money, and he worked with him as like a counselor and 
[00:38:00]  worked in the kitchen.  And he's like a millionaire.  He's a millionaire.  But this one, I mean, it was sad.  I, you know, I get a little verklempt, whatever the word is.  And if Jimmy was here, he'd be like, well, verklempt?  Did you say verklempt?  Really?  Stupid?  Dude.  I'm doing Jimmy's role today.  Yeah.  Nice ascot ass.  What a loser.  Who makes fun of you because you look good?  Dude.  No, we'll get into the ascot thing in a minute.  But continue. 
[00:38:30]  You think we forgot about the ascot?  You didn't have to bring that one up.  That was on the list of things to ask you about.  Anyway.  So it's called Secret Millionaire.  Go ahead.  And then the guy goes in and he's working as, you know, like a homeless guy.  Like, nobody really thinks he's just a hump just like them.  Yeah.  And he's just, he has no money.  He's just a piece of garbage.  He's treated like a dirt bag.  No, no, no.  They become friends.  Like, he became friends with all the homeless guys that work in the kitchen.  And he became friends with this lady, this Asian lady with the kid.  But he's really, you know, just a millionaire.  At the end of the show, he goes back and he decides how much money to dole out. 
[00:39:00]  Based on what?  Well, he sits down.  You know, all these people that are affected and don't have cash, he sits down and figures out.  But like the other shows, like the guys cutting checks for this one family, $100,000 each.  You're a millionaire.  And it's a tax write-off, by the way.  Yeah.  The whole thing's a tax write-off.  Sure.  And this guy last night, he was an Indian dude.  So I think he's a little stingy with his cash or something because he's cutting like $10,000 checks. 
[00:39:30]  It's like you're getting all like sad and then all of a sudden you look at the check, it's like $10,000.  I can do that.  That's easy.  I can give that check $10,000.  Yeah, really.  You're a millionaire.  Yeah, he gave one.  The Asian lady who lives in a room in this crappy hotel in San Fran with her kid just struggling to survive.  He gave her $10,000.  That's not going to do much.  Well, you know, they were kind of like, oh my God.  Oh, $10,000.  Really?  That's it?  You just said you're a millionaire.  A thousandaire or a millionaire?  Yeah.  Millionaire.  Oh, okay.  You want to put another one?  First of all, you know they have to pay taxes on it because they have to spend like a gift 
[00:40:00]  tax, which is probably 50%.  Take a half.  So they give five.  But no, the worst part is they don't know they have to pay taxes, so they're going to  spend it all, then get the bill because they don't know what taxes are.  Wait a minute.  Then they'll have to go to jail, just ruin their lives.  That's why game shows are BS because actually that's why most of them are going to cash now  because these dummies would go on Wheel of Fortune or whatever show and collect or price  is right and get the brand new boat and the jet skis and the car and the trip to Europe 
[00:40:30]  and they just go back home and they use their jet skis and their boat and they take their  trip to Europe.  Next thing you know, the tax man goes, you owe us about $100,000 on all these prizes you  got.  I know somebody on it and most people just sell everything now.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just sell it all.  You have to.  Yeah.  Especially if it's a dresser.  Uh-huh.  Don't they give you the option to take a really huge cut in the value of it for cash? 
[00:41:00]  Of course.  Yeah.  It's all just for show.  It's all for show.  Like Oprah's car giveaway, she set up those people with a nice tax bill.  Giant tax bill.  Oprah, I don't want your stupid car.  I pay enough taxes.  It costs me a lot of money.  With Secret Millionaire, the millionaire gets to decide at the end of it, I think you sort  of said it, how much they want to give.  Yeah, he has to figure out, like, I'm going to give this old bag $10,000 and I'm going  to give the place she works for $30,000, $35,000. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  But he was doing out, he didn't do all that much.  $35,000 to one place, the homeless shelter.  Well, a minimum of $100,000 they have to give away.  Yeah, but I mean, you're a millionaire.  Just give $100,000 to each person.  I want to do that show and just hand out $10 bills.  You know something, a millionaire...  I think he did that at the Halloween party.  Oh!  Oh!  A millionaire could mean a million bucks.  So, are you giving away $100,000?  Me and Patrice had this debate.  If you're a millionaire, you have to have at least $10 million.  If it's anything under $10,000, you're a thousandaire. 
[00:42:00]  I agree.  Because after taxes and...  Look, if you have a million dollars, if you spend $1, you're not a millionaire.  You're a thousandaire.  Well, I figured out that I'm actually probably a dollar heir and Patrice might be like a thousandaire.  Like maybe...  No, he might be a dollar heir too.  A hundred heir.  Yeah, you might be definitely...  I don't know.  You guys are thousandaires?  Yeah.  Because you don't have $10 million in the man.  No.  Yeah, you guys are thousandaires.  I wish I did.  You're not millionaires.  You're thousandaires.  Thousandaires.  Hey, I'm on the way to being a 10 cent heir. 
[00:42:30]  But you make a good point because if you have a million, which of course is a lot of money,  but when they start bragging about it to make a TV show, like who wants to marry a millionaire?  Yeah.  That schmuck had a million dollars and won.  Yeah, one million dollars and one dollar.  He just made the criteria.  And that dumb bimbo, what was her name?  Darvakanga?  Darvakanga.  Darvakanga.  Congers or whatever?  Congers.  She thought she was into some money and realizing this guy didn't have that much considering 
[00:43:00]  he says he's a millionaire.  Think about after you buy a house for maybe $700,000, you have $300,000 left.  You're going to have to keep working.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  Why are you going to work?  You're a millionaire.  That's the gauge right there.  If you could stop working for the rest of your life and not worry about anything and keep  or maybe even do more, have more of the lifestyle you're accustomed to, then you're set.  You're a legitimate millionaire. 
[00:43:30]  If not, you're not a millionaire.  If you could take $2 million, put it in the bank, or put it into some low-risk stock thing,  something really low-risk.  Which is nothing now.  Right.  Well, yeah.  Maybe a couple months ago.  Yeah.  You could remain a millionaire and live off the interest.  There is a certain point.  There's no living off interest anymore.  Not on you guys.  You guys bet on yourselves.  What's wrong with you?  No, there's no living off interest. 
[00:44:00]  You used to be able to take money, put it in the bank, and live off the interest.  What was the interest rate in the 70s, 80s?  Oh, my God.  10% or something ridiculous?  You got like ridiculous.  Yeah, 10, 15%.  Or you could actually do what Bobby's saying is just live off the interest.  You can't do that nowadays.  You know, I'm not saying put it in the-  1%?  I mean, you do well if you put the money in a-  Slow risk.  Yeah, sure.  Like a $2 million or something like that.  You do okay, but you're not living off that.  No.  Excuse me, sir.  What's this?  Oh, boy.  What did you want here, Bobby?  Did I ever say that?  Did the word sandwich ever come out of my mouth?  Oh, Christ. 
[00:44:30]  Did the word sandwich ever come out?  Do I eat food?  Do I look like I eat carbohydrates?  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Exactly, Bobby.  Do I look like I eat carbohydrates?  Not anymore.  Right, Bobby?  Do I look-  Maybe you want-  Come here.  You eat this bread.  Get over here and eat this bread.  Dude, he's a 38-year-old intern.  Give him a break.  Look at this guy.  Cut him some slack.  How desperate he is.  Get David in here.  I want him to eat this bread.  You're right.  Where's David?  David.  I don't eat bread.  My David.  My David.  We haven't talked to David in a while.  We should have David do something today.  David is- 
[00:45:00]  You want to do kosher sports?  What do you want to do with David today?  Yeah, I'd throw him out a window.  Really?  Perhaps.  Really?  David's a little too comfortable.  Yeah.  He's a little too comfy around here these days.  And it shows.  Of course.  Knowing this company, he's probably our new boss.  Just hasn't told us yet.  Because as an intern, it's like, you know, of course you don't want him bowing and averting  his eyes when you walk in.  But-  What was that movie with Robert Redford where he went into the- as a prisoner, but he was 
[00:45:30]  really the warden?  Brubaker?  Yeah, Brubaker.  Is that-  I don't know.  Brubaker.  Yeah.  David comes in.  I'll be.  Anthony, I would like to talk to you today.  Yes.  I run everything.  I run the media.  I figured.  Hey, I want to get back to Bobby with this crying thing.  So, secret millionaire makes you cry?  Yeah.  Dude, look, let me tell you something.  I have something happen to me where, you know, I opened something up like in therapy 
[00:46:00]  like a year and a half ago.  Like, we went into back to when little Bobby, they used to call me- let me just tell you,  first of all, they used to call me Spiff.  I wasn't Bobby.  Spiff?  Spiff.  Aw.  Aw, we're hanging with Spiff today, Ant.  Spiff.  What a cute little nickname.  Because my mother used to let my hair grow long, and I used to wear suspender shorts and  a bow tie every day.  Get out of here.  I swear to God, I'll get you a picture.  How old were you?  I don't know why-  18?  18?  How you guys give us all to open up and just throw our garbage on the table, and then you 
[00:46:30]  give it to the savages on Pal Talk.  Yeah, then we just smash in the face.  How old were you that it was acceptable to wear a bow tie and suspender shorts, Anthony?  Not suspender, like, because suspenders, some of the older folk in the audience will remember  it was in style for about a day or two.  Yeah.  It really was.  You were wearing lederhosen.  Yes.  Yes.  You were wearing lederhosen. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, it was very similar to that.  How old were you, really?  I'm not good with that age.  I don't know.  I can't go back with, hey, I must have been.  I don't know.  Just remember who was beating you at the time, and then do the math.  Well, this is the point.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I know I'm right.  I wasn't getting beat at the time.  I was actually-  All right.  That's good.  This was just before the BM stepped into my life.  Oh, yeah.  The stepfather.  I say BM because I don't want to give his name over the radio, but-  All right.  He, so it had to be before first grade. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  First grade, I was spiff.  So you got this out in therapy?  Well, we went back to spiff.  Right.  We started talking to spiff.  Gotcha.  Did you-  Were you talking to spiff in therapy?  No.  You're not one of those weirdos, are you?  I was just-  Can we talk to little spiff?  Let's talk to spiff.  Can we talk to little spiff?  Hi.  Is spiff with us today?  Spiff?  Please tell me you talked to spiff.  Hi, LP.  How are you?  Everything's great today.  Spiff.  Who else do we have in the room today? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, I get those people.  We have Billy.  Hi, Billy.  Billy, no need to be angry.  I'm not angry.  No, no, it scares spiff.  Don't take me into the closet.  Don't take me into the closet.  Psycho babble crap.  I don't want to put it in my mouth.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that good?  Young spiff.  I love those dummies out there that think they could cure the multi-personality person.  Who are we talking to now? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, the guy that's got to pay for this crap, I guess.  Right.  The guy that signs the check and gives it to you like an idiot.  No, he doesn't do that.  My therapist, I actually, the one thing he does is he looks at the clock.  I catch him looking at the clock.  See, that's why I can't do that.  And I actually called him on.  I go, you look at the clock again.  I'm going to smash you.  Thank you.  The clock.  Wow.  He goes, you're not paying me enough to not look at that clock.  That's probably the only reason I.  He's good.  Probably the only reason why I don't go into third. 
[00:49:00]  Because I know they're just there like, uh-huh, I'll care about you for the next hour.  And then I got the next dummy waiting to get in here.  No, this guy's good.  Yeah.  I actually like Alan.  Alan Lefkowitz.  Um, but he, uh, yeah, he, you know what it was?  Is we, we started talking about that stuff.  And that's the stuff that you forget, you push down.  And you just, you know, you'll talk about it casually.  Yeah.  But when you start talking about it for real, little spiff.  Little spiff that was happy, you know, lived in a, lived in the Irish Catholic home with 
[00:49:30]  13 people, but everybody was still happy.  My uncles slept all over and my aunts had a room.  Me and my mother slept on a mattress on the floor.  My grandmother, my grandfather.  But we all, you know, had food.  The little rascals?  Yeah, it was like that.  The hell is going on?  It was a really good time.  Sounds like some old scene from the 30s.  My uncle would take me in the back and teach me how to make, we talked about it last week,  making bow and arrows.  Sure.  One uncle would teach me how to fight.  The other one taught me math.  The other one taught me how to like, you know, like do work and like get a job done. 
[00:50:00]  And, you know, my grandfather taught me about life.  It was really, and then my mother.  It sounds very like nice and educational and everything.  How did you get so screwed up?  Well, then my mother, I apparently got lonely, insecure, twizzer that she is, and she met  some guy that was just bugging her, just bugging her to get married.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he really, that's what she told me later in her life.  He just kept bugging me to get married.  And finally, I was like, you know what?  Screw it.  What happened?  A little spiff.  And then we moved in.  And I remember, I'll tell you the day that it happened.  We moved into the brand new apartment. 
[00:50:30]  This guy had money, too.  He was an insurance adjuster.  He had one of those wheels on a stick in the back of his trunk that he would walk.  You'd have to walk and chalk off how many feet were skid marks before the disaster.  Yeah, yeah.  Things like that.  Right, exactly.  He had the Monte Carlo with the T-roofs and the spokes.  Oh, wow.  Back when that was the T-roof.  Remember the T-roof?  You had to take it off, put it in the trunk.  Sure.  Pan the ass.  I'll hold the fat chick.  Just hold my T-roofs as we drive. 
[00:51:00]  Best thing about those, they never leaked.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  They didn't figure that one out.  Not a drop came through.  They couldn't figure that one out.  No, they couldn't.  But we moved into the new apartment out of my grandmother's house where we were packed  in.  We were sleeping on a mattress on the floor.  We moved into the new apartment.  I remember walking into my bedroom and I had this beautiful ceiling fixture, like a light,  but it was like a modern chandelier. 
[00:51:30]  And I had a toy box full of toys, brand new, a desk full of desk stuff.  This is the best life ever.  Yeah, right.  Like young Spiff.  Right.  With a little English hat on and knickers.  I could just picture you in suspenders.  Thank you, mom.  You sure they were calling you Spiff and not?  What?  Because of your Hispanic background.  Oh, my mother did that to me, too.  Well, I looked more Asian when I was young. 
[00:52:00]  She used to hold me up and I used to cry every time she did it, too.  Hysterically crying.  She used to hold me up and go, someday a woman's going to come to the door, Bobby, and go,  oh, Mrs. Kelly, you got a wrong baby.  And then I would cry.  Oh, and you'd cry.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I was still Spiff.  Poor young Spiff.  Yeah.  But then I remember, this is what happened, Rennie.  I had my brand new room.  Brand new.  My sister had her own room.  They had a room.  I'm not hearing anything bad yet.  Okay.  So I'm in.  All good.  It's like a fabulous childhood.  We end the story now.  You had a great childhood. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Let's just end it here.  I had a little side room on my room, like a little side room with a couple beanbags  and a TV and a set of binoculars.  Because if you got the binoculars and looked out that window, there was a drive-in that you  could actually watch movies from.  Oh.  Right.  I remember watching Benji.  Remember Benji?  Of course.  What a perfect childhood.  This is awesome.  So one day, I fell asleep in the beanbag.  I was watching my TV, my little TV, my little 13-inch black and white TV that was mine.  The young Spiff is in his own room.  And I remember waking up, and it went from day to night. 
[00:53:00]  You know, when you nap from day to night, it's kind of a-  Yeah.  I do it all the time, believe me.  And I woke up, and I remember waking up with a smile on my face, like happy.  I remember being happy.  And I went out to the kitchen, and I opened the door, and it was like opening a door to  traffic.  Because I remember my sister had a phone cord wrapped around her neck, crying.  My mother was screaming and crying, and this guy was walking around with his fish clenched. 
[00:53:30]  And my sister went to make a phone call.  He grabbed the phone cord, wrapped it around her, and threw it at her head.  And then my mother went to grab him, and he punched her in the stomach.  And then my mother grabbed my sister and me, ran into the bedroom.  And I tried to shut the door, and I was trying to hold the door.  Oh, young Spiff was trying to protect his family.  Right?  They're crying.  Now, he's six- I think he was six-four. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, wonderful.  Okay?  I remember there's a foot coming through the door.  Let's go.  Like a horror movie.  Oh, no.  The door goes flying.  Here's Johnny.  And this is what I remember.  This is what I-  Did your mom send you through the bathroom window to slide down the big snowbank and get  to the snowcat?  Foot comes through the door.  I was retracing my footsteps in blood.  Yeah.  So, the foot comes through the door.  I go flying against the wall.  Now, this is what I- I mean, I was a coward at this age. 
[00:54:30]  Oh.  This is what, like, probably affects my rage now, like, when I get so angry.  You're making up for it now.  Well, he- I remember I pretended to be hurt because I was so scared.  Yeah.  Like, I kind of- I pretended to get knocked out.  Like, I hit the wall, but I wasn't.  Oh, really?  And I kind of just slid down the wall.  Like, he would feel bad for me, but he didn't.  Now, you're an easier target.  An unconscious Spiff.  Yeah.  And, uh, he just came in. 
[00:55:00]  He just started screaming.  He goes, shut up.  You- you know, he just started snapping.  What was he mad at- what was he mad about?  I- you know what, dude?  Can I just tell you something?  I- I swear to God, you should be my therapist.  I- I never asked my mom what that was about.  What happened there?  But my mother's Irish Catholic, so she's going, can't we just forget about it?  Why do you- can't we just move on?  Bury it.  Swallow it.  Yes.  Put it in a deep, dark spot in your body where it'll never come out.  Oh, really?  Oh, God. 
[00:55:30]  You heard that as a kid.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God.  Swallow it.  So you have no idea why this guy turned into a complete lunatic.  It was, honest to God, the first time I ever saw that type of rage.  Of rage and anger and violence.  I never saw it.  Never saw it.  I saw my uncle's fight, but it was always stupid stuff.  I never, ever saw it.  Young Spiff's perfect little life right then was just turned topsy-turvy.  Because my mother was a lonely bitch. 
[00:56:00]  And had to marry this friggin' violent idiot.  How did it end?  And he slammed the door, and then I remember us just holding each other.  Like, we were connected.  That's a horrible scene if you gotta do that.  We were just all holding each other and just shaking and crying.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh.  What the hell, Bobby?  Oh, man.  You were living in that dumb movie with the red wagon.  What was the name of that?  Oh, yes.  The radio flyer.  The radio flyer.  Yeah, the king.  Yeah, the king. 
[00:56:30]  The king came in.  Your mom married the king.  That was the last time I talked to Spiff.  Or you're like the, what's his name?  Dwight Yoakam in Sling Blade.  Yeah.  Get out of my house!  What do you mean the last time you talked to Spiff?  You were Spiff.  Yeah, I know.  That's the last time it was Spiff.  Yeah, that was it.  That was the last time I was Spiff.  Spiff was his innocence.  That was his young innocence.  Right after that, he became Bobby.  Bob.  Bob Kelly.  That was it.  Well, Young's happy Spiff was dead. 
[00:57:00]  Did she kick him to the curb or was it kind of like...  Cut to five years later.  Five years later.  Five years.  They were together for five years?  I got kicked out of Catholic school because of him.  Because I went in with a black eye one day.  He punched me in the face.  Yeah.  And I went into school with a black eye.  And I had already learned how to stuff the, you know, because the teacher was like, what  happened?  I was like, nothing.  And I got a black eye and I'm trying to hold back tears.  And they had to take me out in the hall.  And then I had to tell them what happened.  And then they were like, you know, we can't have this here. 
[00:57:30]  So I got kicked out of Catholic school.  We can't have this here.  They didn't call, like, the police.  It was like, hey, get out of our school.  You're making us look bad.  Yeah.  What a lovely religion.  Your mom married Dwight Yoakam.  Yeah.  He was bad.  Listen to the replay.  Oh, you said it?  Oh, fuck.  I had a good one, too.  I even said Dwight Yoakam from Sling Blade.  From Sling Blade.  Oh, my God.  And I even added a line in.  Get out of my house.  I didn't hear.  I'm sorry.  I did a whole Dwight Yoakam thing.  That's fine. 
[00:58:00]  I did like 10 minutes on Dwight Yoakam.  It's good to know I'm in good company.  I like this guy.  So, you've got to be mad at your mom.  Yeah.  We're staying in this for five years.  Well, this is even the thing now, is that, you know, I mean, you know, we cut to five  years later.  She's finally leaving him.  And what would happen was, you know, he would call my sister fat.  All right.  I'm with you now.  We're back on the same page.  He would call my sister fat, and they hit me, and, you know, all this stuff. 
[00:58:30]  And then, this is what changed.  This is where I snapped.  This is where I realized violence, rage, and anger has more of an effect, and almost  feels better than trying, because nobody talks to you.  Nobody helps you through this stuff.  He came after me one day, yelling at me, screaming at me, and I grabbed a knife, and  he actually went, go ahead, do it.  Wow.  Without even hesitating, I came down with the knife.  He moved his hand.  Then, I chased him around the house with the knife. 
[00:59:00]  I was in sixth grade.  Okay?  Sixth grade, and you're ready to murder somebody.  Murder him, dude.  My mother came down and grabbed me, and, like, had to hold me back.  I was like, I'm going to kill him.  I'm going to kill him.  Because he tried to make me do yard work on, like, a Sunday or a Saturday, some crappy-  But that's what parents do.  No, no, no, no.  Anything this guy told me to do.  It wasn't that.  It was his-  We all had chores to do on weekends.  I cried.  Chores would, one thing, he used to make me do, like, the stuff that he should do. 
[00:59:30]  Like, you know, dig out a stump.  You know?  What was his problem?  Dig out a stump at 12 years old.  Hard work.  I'm in sixth grade.  I'm out there.  He'd make me do it with, like, a spoon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two days later, Bobby's still following where the roots are going.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Yeah.  What is the matter with you?  Digging up sidewalks to get to more root.  Right.  Yeah.  Was he a drinker?  What was his deal?  We got to take a break, but wrap the-  He wasn't a drinker.  He wasn't a drinker. 
[01:00:00]  I don't know what he was.  He was just-  Where did his rage come from?  How bad do you want to punch him in the face right now?  I actually saw him.  When?  No way.  I saw him one time.  I worked at Grossman's Bargain Outlet in the indoor-outdoor carpet section.  Oh.  And I used to roll myself up in the carpet and take naps.  And one day, I unrolled myself after my little lovely nap, and I looked over-  And there he was, beating your family again.  You know, I hate face cloths because of this guy, because every morning he would take a shower,  and he would dry his hair with a face cloth.  Like, just rub it over and over and over and over, and then part his hair to the side 
[01:00:30]  perfectly with one of those combs, and then get that guy hairspray, I forget the name  of it, and spray-  Ugh.  Ugh.  Just for men.  Yeah, something like that.  One of those man products.  I actually had to leave.  I ran out, and I had to take off.  Because he wasn't as big to me anymore, because I was like, you know, I was 18 at the time,  high school.  You should have punched him in the face.  I know.  Although, it's so easy to say everything, you just, like me, start crying. 
[01:01:00]  I just remember this.  All he wanted was a Corvette.  That's all he kept complaining.  And we, he couldn't get a Corvette because of us, because of the money he had to spend  on his family.  Right.  And he finally got a Corvette, but apparently he got so fat, he couldn't fit into it anymore,  so we had to sell it.  Nice.  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  All right, Bobby.  Thanks for sharing.  That's, that's insane.  We're going to take a quick break and continue.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  But this is good.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore. 
[01:01:30]  I can't watch that movie.  I bet.  I bet, man.  It's close to home, huh?  Uh, so it leads to today where you cry at shows like Secret Millionaire.  Ugh, I was, my wife walked in last night.  She thought somebody died.  Oh.  I'm just sniffling.  Fuck.  Extreme Home Makeover?  I can't watch it.  Yeah, a little rough, right?  Ah, I can't, I can't watch it.  I can't, I can't.  What's some of those other shows you cry at?  Uh, Little People, Big People.  Biggest Loser.  Johnny Cade. 
[01:02:00]  Plus A.  The Struggles.  The Thing of War.  Or Little Spiff is dead.  He died that day.  No, no, Spiff, Spiff, Spiff is, he died that day.  No, see, what Bobby's saying is Spiff is back.  Spiff, it was reborn.  Yeah, he's got, he's got a, like a new innocence, right?  Am I leading?  I don't know, you know what?  I think you've come full circle.  Like, you finally got rid of the tough Bobby, like, I gotta protect everybody and my mom and  my sister.  Nice.  And now I allow Spiff back into my life, and I enjoy the simple things that life offers. 
[01:02:30]  No, I still punch the fridge.  All right, well.  If you back my wife's head into the fridge, my punch marks go around her head perfectly.  Great.  I was going for the happy ending.  You chose to living in hell.  877-212-018.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  This is too far down the road, but I'll mention it anyway.  Bobby's going to be at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey on January 15th  through the 17th.  So you might want to write that down.  Bobby's awesome.  Absolutely.  Awesome on those comedy stages and on the radio with us. 
[01:03:00]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony on a Friday.  Oh, that's right.  Damn.  Friday.  Nice.  Where's my Friday guy?  We're looking for new Friday guys.  So far, what has been sent in, eh, not so good.  So Bon Jovi, top touring act of 2008.  That's where we were.  Can I tell you something, too?  Yep.  Who is iTunes' top 10 comedy CDs? 
[01:03:30]  Number one.  Dane Cook.  No, Robert Kelly.  Just the tip.  Robert Kelly.  I would like to thank the Opie and Anthony fans for helping make that happen.  Bravo.  All 13 of them that bought my CDs.  Who's number two?  Steve Byrne.  Who?  Oh.  I'm not even kidding.  I know a little something something about comedy.  Who's Steve Byrne?  He's a, well, this is one of his jokes, too. 
[01:04:00]  He's a friend of mine, so I can say this, because he's Irish and Asian.  He's, so that makes him Caucasian.  He's a white guy.  He's half white and half Asian, so he's Caucasian.  All right.  Thanks for that, Bobby.  He's funny.  He's a funny guy.  And that was number two, huh?  Actually, Norton says his hairline, it looks like he has Lego hair.  I used to call that Mr. Potato Head hair. 
[01:04:30]  Wait, no.  Why am I trying to make your joke better?  I'm an idiot.  Actually, it was Norton's joke.  It wasn't mine.  Do I have to tear down walls here sometimes?  Sure, go ahead.  No, he usually tears down the wall.  But people, I'm reading on Peloton, somebody I just read, what happened to the Pendulum Contest?  Now, if you've listened to this show over the years, you realize we hold contests and we never finish them.  But it's just part of the show.  Yeah, it's just an excuse to get people to send in stuff, have some fun with it, and then we move on. 
[01:05:00]  We never mention a prize.  Nope.  We never mention when the contest ends.  There's no contest rules.  Nope.  It's just we call it a contest, but it's more like, please give us material so we can do less.  Yeah.  We should start just calling it audience participation.  Right.  Let's just leave the whole contest word out of it.  Yeah, yeah, it's audience participation.  Yeah.  No, I do that, though.  That's great that some kid who really thought he was going to win something, he just shattered his whole... 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah, they did something, they put something together, sent it in, hoped, prayed.  You know he bought Christmas presents based on the prize he was going to win from you guys?  Right.  Don't worry, honey, we can afford it, trust me.  Yeah, this one's a shoe-in.  I got December's mortgage payment paid.  So they sent me that check for the winning entry.  She keeps telling her parents, no, it is a good song.  He is going to win.  Listen, I heard it, and they did say it on the radio that that was their favorite.  Wrong.  You're not winning anything.  So here we go, the top ten grossing concerts. 
[01:06:00]  Now, this is what I want to do with Anthony and Bobby.  How many of these shows would you really go see?  And these were the biggies that people were checking out this past year.  All right.  In 10th place, Rascal Flats.  Oh, that's contrary.  Oh, no, they are.  I might have been dragged to a Rascal Flats concert if I had stayed with somebody, but I never got the opportunity.  Shame on you, man.  A lot of people checking out the Rascal Flats.  Whatever.  I don't know who they are.  And then you got the Eagles in 9th place. 
[01:06:30]  The Eagles?  I would probably see the Eagles.  Yeah, I'd probably check them out.  Donovan McNabb is a singer?  No.  We're not talking about the football team.  Be more funny.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  That's kind of funny.  That was kind of funny.  That's all right.  Actually.  Then you had the Spice Girls.  No.  Then you got Neil Diamond.  As a goof, I would probably go see Neil Diamond.  Yeah.  These were the top grossing acts of 2008.  Love on the Rocks. 
[01:07:00]  No surprise.  I love Neil Diamond.  Neil Rock.  E-Rock went to Neil Diamond?  Neil Rock saw E-Diamond.  Neil Rock.  I got acid reef rocks today.  Do you?  And it's driving me nuts.  Aw.  Drink some Maalox.  I'm in pain.  Have some Maalox.  I'm sweating even.  You should drink a cup of coffee and eat a lot of chocolate.  Yeah.  All right.  Neil Diamond.  Then you got Kenny Chesney.  Another one I might have been dragged to go see a few months back, but in this day and age, no. 
[01:07:30]  Hell no.  Okay.  Then you got Celine Dion.  Yeah.  Never in a million years on a bet would I go and see her.  You know what?  I'm lying.  I'm reading this list.  Celine Dion.  Did you see her wink at you?  Oh, God.  I love that.  And come to those dramatic endings to her songs where she throws that fist in the air.  Here it is.  She leans on one ass cheek and points to the crowd and winks at you.  That's the end of the song, baby.  Phony.  Looks like someone's been to a Celine Dion show.  Yeah.  Her awful, like, dead person hips. 
[01:08:00]  She really does.  It's like mummy hips.  Yeah.  She has the mummy hips.  Her bones sticking out of the tight pants she wears thinking they're sexy.  She has awful hips.  Her just spaded shovel ass.  Wears those leather pairs.  Oh, she's disgusting.  Nothing more painful than a chick with, like, hip bones that are poking out.  And it's like just, ow.  Yeah, just go do something.  Let me control this because you're hurting me. 
[01:08:30]  Was she ever hot?  No.  You said yeah, though.  No, she was just worse than what she was.  Right.  Her teeth.  Remember her teeth when she first?  Oh.  Well, she was a kid, and that creepy, ghoul husband of hers who was managing her at the  time.  Rene.  Rene.  He can't even say it the right way.  Rene.  Rene.  Realized that he wanted a piece of that when she was, like, 12 or something, and they wound  up getting married.  Yeah, then he fixed her up like Pinocchio.  Yeah.  Got her new teeth. 
[01:09:00]  Got a nose job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's not as bad as she was if you look at her.  Yeah.  Yeah, she had really bad teeth.  She's horrible.  All right, then you got Celine Dion, of course.  And then, finally, the only concert I saw this past year on this list, The Police.  Ah, The Police.  I think they came in, like, fifth place, that looks like, or fourth place.  Okay, then you got Madonna.  Never, ever would I sit amongst a huge audience of homosexuals to see Madonna.  Call it a gaggle. 
[01:09:30]  A gaggle of bitches to go see Madonna.  Madonna looks bad now, too.  Her legs.  Dude, she went in the wrong direction with that weight loss and working out.  Once you reach a certain age, you just don't have that muscle mass and the fat content under  your skin.  And it just, she looks awful.  She's like mummy.  Yeah, her butt, it doesn't have that butt anymore. 
[01:10:00]  It's just like the coccyx bone is sticking out.  Yeah, yeah.  The bone is sticking out and the pants stretched over it.  She doesn't have to, like, even spread her butt cheeks when she goes poop.  It just comes out because it's just open, exposed butt.  It's just awful.  Yeah, she's lost the meat.  Yeah, she lost the meat on her.  There's no meat left.  There's no crease in her butt.  It's just open.  She used to be pretty hot looking.  Well, back...  But now, like, she went too far with her procedures and she's starting to look, like, cat-like. 
[01:10:30]  You know, when the women get too much face work done?  I don't know if it was a facelift or what, but now there's something going on where everything's  stretched and she's got puffy cheekbones and her lips.  Her hands look like she works on, like, an oil rig.  You know what I mean?  Like a $20 whore hand.  Chafed.  Dirty knuckles and her fingernails are fatter than her knuckles.  Like, her fingernail is just a fat fingernail.  I like when she first came out and looked like she smelled.  That's the Madonna I like. 
[01:11:00]  God, you just nailed it.  It's the swarthy Madonna.  He just knew she might have...  The eyebrows.  She didn't shave her arms...  No, her arms...  ...as often as she probably should have.  Let it go under her arms a little bit.  Yeah.  So you got Madonna and what would that make her?  Third place?  Okay.  Then Springsteen and then, of course, Bon Jovi was the top-grossing act of 2008.  Man, if you thought back in the 80s that Bon Jovi would be a top-grossing act in 2008, 
[01:11:30]  that's bizarre to even imagine.  Bon Jovi is...  I've seen him twice.  Yeah.  And you're going to understand, like...  He's a performer.  He's a performer, Anthony.  And he comes out...  Not just the musician.  He's a performer.  He owns the stage and the crowd.  Yes.  He can come out and he doesn't even say...  He says, shot through the heart, and then the rest of the crowd just sings the rest of  the song, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  That's not too annoying.  I mean, you don't even have to sing the song.  You know, if I could just go out...  You know you're famous.  If I could just go out and say one joke, and then they just do the rest of the act.  Wouldn't that be great as a comic, if you could just say one joke, and then, like, you put 
[01:12:00]  the mic out, and the audience does it?  Actually, they can do that with Voss's act.  They used to do that with Dice, with the...  Nursery rhymes.  The nursery rhymes, yeah.  Yeah.  But, well, there's a generation gap, because I actually said that, the police, and then  there's Bon Jovi, but Bon Jovi's still clinging on to generations of kids that are coming up,  because the commercial's like, I actually asked this girl at a club, I don't know what she  was, 20, Harley was her name, smoking hot, and she knows she's been molested, too, because 
[01:12:30]  she was hot, but she had no self-esteem.  She shouldn't have even been talking to me, but she was.  This is perfect.  Perfect.  She said, I said, yeah, did you ever see Smokey and the Bandit?  She went, what?  I go, Burt Reynolds, Smokey and the Bandit?  No, I don't even know what that is.  Why would you even say that to a 20-year-old?  I just didn't know that I reached that age.  Of course you have.  You've got to have a 20-year-old filter in your head for stuff you say, so you don't 
[01:13:00]  sound like the old bastard you are.  Do you have any more pedophile tricks?  No, this is just how I live my life.  I know exactly what you're not supposed to say.  You don't say things like that.  Your knowledge starts at like 1988 if you're 20.  I didn't know.  At the year of your birth, you probably know what's going on because you'll learn about  it later when you're a little older.  I had to do, the Census Bureau sent me a couple of letters and of course I just shred them 
[01:13:30]  and then someone came to the door and asked, you know, he said, well, we've sent a couple  of letters and now I'm here to do the census.  Did he say it like that or did he say it like this?  Oh, with a shotgun in his mouth.  Well, close.  Oh, really?  Well, you know how it is.  When strange people knock on my door, I'm prepared, let's just say.  That's all.  I'm just prepared.  No one's going to kick my door in and go, hey, surprise.  So, you know, I opened it.  He had his credentials.  I had gotten the letters.  I said I didn't. 
[01:14:00]  I just threw them away.  He goes, by law, you have to, you know, the census is very important in figuring out who  lives where and whatever.  So he starts going through things and I had to, he goes, okay, date of birth.  And I'm looking around the house and I go, maybe we should step into the other room.  Somebody here I might not want to hear.  You know, I'm not hiding my age, but the thing is to say what year you're born, it puts it 
[01:14:30]  in perspective to a 20 year old.  Honey, I put the Skittles on the table.  I'm going to go in the other room.  That's like me talking to somebody who remembers the Kaiser and, you know, beating the Kaiser  in Germany, remembers German soldiers with pointy helmets.  Did he ask you how old your daughter was when he was in the house?  Hey, yeah.  It's just you and your daughter living here?  Because they ask how many people live here.  Is it just you and your daughter?  Yeah.  He said that?  Then I deep kissed her right in front of him. 
[01:15:00]  Daddy says I'm the best.  Yes.  Yeah, I said that too.  I said if anybody ever, when you go to the door, if anybody ever says it's your father  home, don't say anything.  Just call me to the door.  I'll start talking and slowly just start touching you very inappropriately.  I just think that would be hysterical to do.  Yeah.  She's my little girl.  And then you just grab a breast and put your hand on her ass. 
[01:15:30]  And have her look like she's trying to blink out some kind of like.  S.O.S.  Help me code with her.  Call the police.  Right.  Child services.  She just paint red marks around her wrist like she just got out of handcuffs.  So the census guy just unzips and starts right there.  Yeah.  Finally.  Something hot.  But yeah, so I, you know, when you blurt out that age or with the year you're born, 
[01:16:00]  not even so much your age, just the year you're born, you're like, oh God, that's ancient  history.  Yeah.  And then, you know what, you know what is a fun little game to play?  Actually, it's not, but I think about it sometimes.  You take like the year you're born and see how many years it is till now, which is your  age, but then go backwards.  Go backwards.  I do that.  And see what it was like for somebody that was born, you know, that many years before.  And it's like, wow, that was a long, long time ago. 
[01:16:30]  Oof.  That's only a couple of like lifetimes.  You almost hung out with people that were born in the, uh, 1800s.  The Titanic.  I could have had.  Almost.  No.  Ah.  Wait a minute.  You've got a great grandma, right?  Well, let me think.  19-12.  How old's your grandma?  I don't know.  Let me think.  1912.  And I went 22, 22, 22.  You want me to do the math?  What do you need?  All right. 
[01:17:00]  You know something?  You're absolutely right.  Someone could have been like 50-something or 60 and been on the Titanic and could have held  me as a little child.  Yeah.  All right.  That's kind of sick.  Someone could have been born in the 1800s.  Mm-hmm.  And, and held me as a baby?  All right.  That, that, I, I don't even want to deal with that thought.  My grandma died at 92.  Um, she held like, you know, her great grandkids.  And if they're lucky enough to like live for, until they're 90, they got 180 year difference. 
[01:17:30]  My grandfather's 98.  Can you imagine?  He's still alive.  There you go.  Yeah.  And he's held some kids that hopefully will get into their 90s.  And there you, there, you got a connection that goes 180 years.  Well, someone might have held him that was born in what?  Like 1801?  Right.  Yeah.  Like that?  Probably, yeah.  Like New Lincoln?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  New Lincoln.  He knew Lincoln.  He was making out with Abe. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Honest Abe.  I don't know.  His crazy wife.  I think he was honest back then.  Oh, there's, there are rumors.  Yes, I did meet Groucho Marx.  You did?  Yeah, I did.  Back in, uh, like 1973, uh, he, it was something called a day at the races out in California.  And, um, it was a quarter horse racing and, uh, Groucho was there and some other celebrities  were Artie Johnson from Rona Martin's laughing and, uh, Joanne Worley was there and, uh, but 
[01:18:30]  Groucho was there and, uh, this was Joel boy.  He, he, they wheeled him up in a wheelchair and, uh, he was, he was at death's door and,  uh, I had him sign an autograph for me, which of course I lost because I was an irresponsible  little kid.  You could have a Groucho Marx autograph.  That's insane.  Yeah.  Groucho.  Groucho.  And if he was alive today, how old would Groucho be?  130 or something?  Something ridiculous.  Shortly after that, he became dead-o. 
[01:19:00]  The lost Marx brother, dead-o.  All right.  When we get back, we got a tasing, uh, video clip.  We'll play the audio, obviously.  Love tasing.  And did I say blank out instead of blink out?  Wow.  Wow.  I'm having a rough one today.  And then the German nursing, uh, home from yesterday, Anthony, we'll finally play this.  What is it?  Uh, German nursing service caters to gay elderly.  I kid you not.  We'll explain next.  And also, uh, I'm being reminded we have a video to show you today, Bobby. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, I heard that.  A nice video.  I know.  A nice video.  Really?  Will you at least sit through it?  All right.  I'll do that if you can go through an acting class.  Listen, listen, will you at least watch the video?  Listen, for the, for the listeners, I will, I will try to watch it.  And I've been working on my, uh, my, uh, my reflex, whatever it is.  Reef.  What is it called?  Gag reflex. 
[01:20:00]  Gag reflex.  Yeah.  But I, yeah, I've been working on my gag reflex with Jim Norton on weekends, but I'll see if  I can get through it.  You'll humor us and try to sit through this video?  I will humor you and try to sit through this video.  Can I eat?  Should I eat first?  Oh, yeah.  No, wait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should, probably.  You just want to see egg?  It's better on a full snack.  Oh, yeah.  As soon as you got your breakfast done, we'll show you the video.  Because you won't be able to eat after.  No.  And, and the, the regulars know what video we're talking about.  I just like, the only thing.  And to the newbies, don't worry.  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll explain after the break. 
[01:20:30]  But first, the F.U. line on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have seven new voice messages.

Opie and Anthony hanging with Robert Kelly from robertkellylive.com for all the tour dates. 
[01:22:30]  Number two on iTunes, as far as comedy CDs go?  Number one, sorry.  Well, in the top ten.  I made up the number one part.  I'm just in number one spot.  That doesn't mean anything.  But iTunes top ten comedy CDs of 08.  That's very cool.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  What else is going on in the world?  Unemployment, Anthony?  Yes.  Hits 26-year high.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, is in our very near future. 
[01:23:00]  Well, who knows?  Of course.  You never know.  I know we'll at least finish out the year and then we'll figure it out from there.  Yeah, unemployment hasn't been this high in 26 years.  So do the math.  It's 80, what, 2?  Yeah, something like that.  But then it, you know, got better.  So what are you going to do?  It'll get better.  I like when they say that.  Gas prices are higher than they've been in 15 years. 
[01:23:30]  It's like, okay, well, then they went down.  Yeah.  It was 15 years ago.  We kind of made it, I guess.  Gas is at a nice little level right now.  Yeah.  What do you think?  What are you paying?  $1.70?  Something like that?  I don't even know.  I pulled up.  You know what I've been doing lately?  Pulling up, getting out of my vehicle,  and sliding the old credit card in there,  and then having the guy come up to me and go,  full serve.  Like, ooh, sorry. 
[01:24:00]  Like, I keep pulling up to the full serves  and getting out to pump my own gas.  I put it in and some code came up.  I was like, what?  What is this?  It says amount to put in.  I'm like, I don't know.  Full.  If you don't have letters here to spell out full.  The full serve guys know what they're doing.  I'd rather do it myself at this point.  They're looking for a buck or two.  You ain't getting nothing out of me, pal.  Now that the prices have dropped,  I'm giving money again at the pump.  You know what I'll tip?  If you remember when Marty McFly first got to Hill Valley, 
[01:24:30]  there was a Texaco station there,  and the Texaco guys came out and serviced the car like a pit crew.  If I see that, then I'll tip.  Bob, you want to take your tires?  Want to go to Starbucks?  Check your water?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, all that.  He's going to be talking about this for the next 15 minutes.  No, no, no.  Want to go grab a couple coffees?  I rarely throw in a Back to the Future reference,  so I figured I would throw one in.  I like chess.  I always play a game of chess.  No, I haven't played chess since the 12-year-old beat my ass online. 
[01:25:00]  What?  No one remembers that scene?  Yeah, we remember.  Of course.  It was a great scene, yeah.  Of course it was.  The whole movie's a great scene.  This is the average right now?  Average is $1.65 a gallon.  Anthony, we've been quizzing you all week.  $1.65 a gallon today is what you'll pay the average.  What was the average a year ago?  A year ago, the average was $2.16.  No.  Higher, higher, higher. 
[01:25:30]  Higher, I'm going to go $2.17.  No.  I'm doing prices right.  No.  One more.  No.  A year ago today.  A year ago today, the price was $3.10.  No.  Okay.  All right.  Also, Bank of America to cut 35,000 jobs in the next three years.  And KB Toys files for bankruptcy. 
[01:26:00]  KB Toys stinks.  Even as a kid.  We don't even have kids and we know that KB Toys stinks.  Because I love going into Toys R Us.  Yeah.  I used to like going into Toys R Us.  They've kind of kitted it down a little too much.  Like I liked going in there and, you know, video games and stuff and checking out some  of the cool, like Hot Wheels cars and action figures, radio control stuff, things like  that. 
[01:26:30]  KB was nothing but stupid dolls for girls and the crappiest radio control garbage ever.  No wonder they're filing for bankruptcy.  Good.  It was never a good, you were like, oh, KB, it's a toy store.  I'll go in.  I'll look around.  Ugh.  Just the worst stuff?  Now my toy stores all have the word guns.  In their, in their name.  Those are my toys.  You got a lot of them too.  Coliseum Gun Traders. 
[01:27:00]  That's my toy store.  Hey, Bobby, you ready to see the video?  I don't know.  We got a video for you.  I'm sure.  Danny, you got that video?  I'm sure it's lovely.  No, it's not where I met my girl.  KB Toys?  Yes.  It's funny.  I, uh, the only thing that makes me laugh about, I hate when you guys show me these  videos and I puke and here comes Sam with a camera so you know it's bad.  No, it's not bad.  Anthony, your cackle during Two Girls Month Cup, it makes me, for some reason that cackle 
[01:27:30]  that you had going was funny to me.  It starts a chain reaction.  You can just hear you.  Your dry heaving starts me cackling.  I can't.  There's nothing funnier than watching someone puke or dry heave.  Yeah, I don't know why, it's just funny.  And your reaction to Two Girls, One Cup got a lot of views.  Yeah.  People really enjoyed that one.  Well, Bobby, we got a nice little video for you.  Yeah, I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's lovely.  Do your deep breathing exercises and when you're ready, turn to the right. 
[01:28:00]  Is there any, can I just ask, is there any way, like, is there any...  He was jumping up and down on his tippy toes.  He can't...  Does anybody have a technique?  Like, is there a technique out there that somebody could give me?  Yeah.  To like, you know...  Be a man.  No, it's not a man.  Be a man.  Man up.  This stuff doesn't make me want to puke or dry heave.  I think it's hilarious.  No, that has nothing to do with being a man.  A real man.  All right, I'm sorry that I was, like, taking a shot at you.  Yeah, Billy.  I'm not Billy.  I want to go beat up Billy for you.  What did I say during the break? 
[01:28:30]  I'm like, I'll do it for you.  BM.  I hate stories like that.  All right, Billy Mitchell.  Nice.  Billy Mitchell.  King of car.  Billy Mitchell is a tool.  He's the biggest tool ever.  What a head of hair on him.  Boy, I'll say.  All right, are you ready, Bobby?  Let me just...  Jeez, Bobby.  I almost threw up when I saw his hair.  Jeez, what's wrong?  His hair is crazy.  I like when he puts the headphones on.  It's that swept-back Mercury look. 
[01:29:00]  You look like Mercury.  Yeah, but he has his own pillow with him everywhere.  Talking about Danny's hair.  Yes, it's wonderful.  Danny and Sam were part of something called...  I think it was called Afro Wars.  It ended so long ago.  What?  Our part, not war part.  Yeah, our part.  No, for some reason, it started the same time the Vietnam War started.  These guys will not give up on this.  We gave up on the contest.  I think Sam officially won because you were up against the Eastside Dave guy.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  And Danny, we didn't even know he was in on the contest.  And he finally had to tell us, dude, I'm in this thing too.  And now you guys have refused to cut your hair ever since.  When did we start that contest, Sam?  I think the contest started last December, at which point I hadn't gotten a haircut in  two months.  So you haven't had a haircut in about 14 months at this point?  Yeah, it was October 07.  Wow.  I won't let him cut his hair.  No?  You like him like that, huh?  I like him like that.  And I taught him a new thing so I don't get arrested too.  Oh, no.  What's that?  Sam, I want to kiss yourself. 
[01:30:00]  Kiss your knuckle.  Kiss it.  No, kiss it soft.  God, Bobby.  Now kiss it slowly like it's me.  Now lick it.  Lick it.  Suck on it.  I'm surprised.  This is disturbing.  Yeah, lick it.  What are you doing?  That's it.  Kiss it like I kiss you.  I would kiss you.  No, don't do that.  That's it.  Sam, why are you doing this?  Because he told me to.  Wow, is that really disturbing that he's doing it?  He's like...  And how would you know that, Bobby?  You and Jimmy with your like... 
[01:30:30]  Oh, we're just acting out stuff.  Yes.  That might happen out there.  What?  We're just playing around.  Yeah.  You know that, Bobby.  Just goofing.  It's a little too real.  Little.  Don't make your lips thin.  Sam is sucking on his knuckle right now because Bobby told him to.  Make your lips full and wet.  Full.  All right, go ahead.  You suck.  All right, now the video, Bobby.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right, is there any...  Like, how do you get through it, Opie? 
[01:31:00]  You don't just know you're just disconnected and desensitized again.  No, no, no.  We've talked about this.  This is not...  Now, this is worse.  This doesn't bother me.  I can't do beheading videos.  Jimmy was talking about some horrendous videos going on and where...  Ultraviolence is like really bad.  Where he's been watching people get killed and stuff.  I can't watch those.  I can't watch that either.  Not because I'll puke more so that it just messes me up.  Although watching people die from somewhere else isn't as bad.  Yeah.  We had this whole break yesterday.  Okay, go ahead.  Let's go.  But this type of thing doesn't really bother me. 
[01:31:30]  I got to go with the flow.  Stunt brain told me to.  All right.  Here we go.  For Bobby.  We're showing a video.  Whoa!  I don't like it already.  Wait, wait.  He turned around.  Will you stop the video?  Hold on.  What are you doing, Bobby?  Is that a...  It's a jar on the floor.  What's on the...  Don't even try to describe it.  Go back.  Is what it is.  Now we got to start over, Bobby.  Is he European?  Why is it like that?  Who cares?  Oh, that isn't even...  Don't even worry about that.  Yeah, here we go, Bobby.  I didn't even pay attention to that.  All right.  The video's playing.  We're just going to let it unfold in front of us. 
[01:32:00]  Let it play.  Keep looking, Bobby.  Watch this.  Oh.  Bobby, keep looking.  Come on.  Just watch.  No.  Just keep looking.  Oh, no.  It doesn't...  No.  Just watch.  Just watch.  No.  Keep it clean for the radio, by the way.  Oh, my God.  No.  See?  There's no jar now.  What happened to the jar?  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Bobby, watch.  Bobby, watch.  Bobby, watch.  Bobby, you gotta look. 
[01:32:30]  Bobby, you gotta look.  No, look.  Look, Bobby.  Hold on.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  He's picking up the breakfast he just needs. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my God, dude.  Was that a pickle jar?  He can still be funny.  Wow.  How great is this guy?  Oh, God.  He can still be funny.  All right, Danny, back up the video, because, unfortunately, you missed a bunch of the goodness.  Yeah.  Back it up a little bit.  Bobby.  Is that blood?  Bobby.  Keep it very vague, please.  We're not answering any of your questions. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  Did you back up the video?  Now, Bobby.  Bobby, will you turn and look, please?  Something's so wrong.  All right.  Just turn and look.  Here we go.  We're going to try this thing.  Is this guy all right?  Sure.  We have no idea what happens after this, but just...  All right, breathe.  Okay, breathe.  Heavy breathing.  We're going to push play again.  You're okay.  We're to the part where the jar has disappeared.  All right, go ahead.  All right, here we go.  Don't even try to describe it.  He's got tears in his eyes, Bobby.  All right, watch.  Watch, watch.  No big deal.  Stay with it. 
[01:34:00]  Stay with it.  Stay with it.  Stay with it.  God, that is really bad.  Bobby.  Let's take a look and see what he does.  Yeah, Bobby, there's going to be a happy ending.  What do you mean?  There's more? 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  What more?  There's going to be a happy ending.  You've got to see how the true resolution...  Yes.  There's a resolution to what?  A pickle jar broke.  Yes, it did.  Keep it vague, Bobby.  Keep it vague.  Keep it vague.  Don't cry over a broken pickle jar.  All right, Bobby's watching a fine video.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  There might be a happy ending.  There might be a nice ta-da idea.  You never know.  All right, ready?  He's taking off his hat.  Yeah, he's getting all hot.  Because my electrolytes are leaving my body.  All right, who has his cell phone too close to the mic? 
[01:35:00]  Daddy.  Is it mine?  Whose is it?  It's not mine.  It's mine.  Someone's just ringing.  It's yours, of course.  Oh, no.  What's happened?  How about we get someone else to work the mic?  We've got 20 people that work for this show.  Steve, you go answer your phone and someone else will work the mic.  All right, Bobby, you ready?  Here we go.  We're going to get through this, Bobby.  Oh, God.  Isn't that bad?  Bobby, we're going to get through this.  Even Keith is like, oh, God, this is really bad. 
[01:35:30]  You look too, cop.  I haven't even watched it yet.  I've been here a couple of times.  No, I don't want to watch it.  You don't want to watch it.  Be a man.  Be a man, Keith the cop.  You don't want to watch it.  All right.  Okay, let her rip.  Let her rip.  Here we go.  Just watch.  Just watch.  Just watch.  Watch.  Watch.  No.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  Don't look away.  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[01:36:00]  See?  See?  Oh, he's panicking, isn't he?  Wouldn't you?  Wouldn't you be?  Oh, he's panicking.  What's going through his head right now is, oh, my God, I really screwed up.  I really screwed up.  Dude, look at that.  Yeah.  They don't show.  That's, like, really.  Oh, my God.  He's trying.  Oh, God.  Look.  Bobby, watch. 
[01:36:30]  You got to watch.  Look how much glass.  And then now there's stuff other than glass coming out.  You all right?  Look at this.  Look at this.  Watch this big chunk.  Wait for it.  He's trying so hard to save his life here.  Wait for it.  Look, watch.  Look, look, look.  Wait for it.  You got to watch this big, viscous, chunky mess.  This could get him going again. 
[01:37:00]  Here we go.  Oh.  This could get it.  He's trying.  Probably going again.  Oh.  Now there's, like, not just glass.  No.  This stuff wasn't supposed to be removed.  Tell me chunks don't come out.  Is this it?  There it is.  Look.  There you go.  You see?  Pieces that aren't glass.  Look at the things hanging.  No.  No, dude. 
[01:37:30]  There you go.  There you go, Bobby.  You made it.  It just, oh, God, dude.  You made it.  What do you think?  Dude, I don't, what do I think?  What do I think?  Oh.  People are saying that's how you lost all your weight.  We made you believe it.  He just throws up at everything now.  Yeah.  He has memories to puke by.  It's just that I can never undo that. 
[01:38:00]  I can never.  Yeah, yeah.  It's never going to, I'm never going to be able to undo that.  That's now part of your permanent memory.  I'm always going to look at, when I'm putting a pickle jar up there, I'm never going to be  able to do it comfortably again.  Yeah.  God, that's just awful.  Why, though?  Is that?  He's got a virtual vice, though, to have a crack like that.  Oh, goodness.  Yeah, a pickle jar is pretty thick, right?  I don't know what kind of jar.  God.  I don't know.  They decided not to do any of that branding. 
[01:38:30]  No, no.  Someone could have got a nice sponsorship.  I'll cut the label off of that one.  Yeah.  Can I just tell you, I'll tell you, the blood doesn't bother me as much as the other stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  That first stuff, for some reason, I get.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Interesting.  The whole beginning part, and then the part where it, boom.  Yeah, where it's actually.  The blood and stuff like that makes me gag a little bit, but it almost looks fake to me.  Like a scary movie or something. 
[01:39:00]  But that first start, when it's that realistic, it's awful to me.  I'll never be able to.  There you go.  One guy, one cup.  Good job, Bobby.  Yeah, you did good.  You actually made it through parts I didn't think you'd make it through.  It's the other stuff that gets me.  All right.  We'll let you.  Do you need a new breakfast now?  Rinse your mouth out.  No, I don't.  I'll buy you breakfast.  I'm not going to eat anything right now.  Really?  No.  Want a pickle?  What do you mean?  You'll buy it.  Didn't you buy me the last?  I'm not paying for that one I ate earlier.  No. 
[01:39:30]  We buy your stupid breakfast.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Everybody, by the way, everyone saw you on cam there on PalTalk, and they're commenting on  how good you look.  Really?  Yeah.  They're bent over puking, but they say you look very good.  You look great when you're puking, is basically what they're saying.  Opie and Anthony, robertkellylive.com.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Got another busy show, Opie and Anthony.  Of course, we got Bob Kelly in studio.  He just checked out One Guy, One Cup. 
[01:40:00]  I'm sure we can at least say that, and you can find it on your own, because I don't think  they're going to let us link it to onaradio.com.  No.  And then you got Jeffrey Ross in studio.  Hi.  He just handed me his DVD.  No offense, live from New Jersey.  Yes, sir.  I remember when you came in to promote this thing, and you were doing it.  A lot of your fans were in the audience during that.  Very cool.  That's a good, that's a very good cover.  Yeah.  Who took that photo?  It's very good.  Like, this looks very nice.  Sometimes you see guys' DVDs. 
[01:40:30]  Floss.  Floss.  And it looks very cheap.  Yeah.  And stuff.  This looks really good.  This is Dancing with the Stars money, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's actually a...  That's what I'm thinking.  Not even a real...  That's a red carpet photo from the Flava Flav roast that they just grabbed and doctored.  Wow.  Really?  You got my ring, my grandpa's ring there, yeah.  Yeah.  You look really good.  Well, thank you.  Available stores everywhere.  Dude, you got so screwed with that Dancing with the Stars.  We had you in here, because you've done our show a million times.  You had your dance partner, who was just ridiculously hot. 
[01:41:00]  Editor.  Likes for days, as they like to say.  Sometimes when I get sad, I listen to a tape of that when I came in with her.  Just her voice.  Really?  Just her voice.  And then we got excited.  We're going to be part of this hit show a little bit.  We knew you would check in, and what happens?  You get kicked off the first week.  I barely made it past the first commercial break.  I came in 13th on a show that normally has 12 contestants.  Ow.  And you got poked in the eye when you needed to dance.  Yeah, you had an injury.  On the last move of the last rehearsal, I'm on my knee, arm spread, like, ta-da. 
[01:41:30]  The last move is for her to swing around me, kick me in the back, and throw me to the ground, like a fake fight.  And she has these long fingernails.  All season, I'm watching her file these fingernails.  Talons.  You know, it's like, and I know at any minute.  And with all the flopping around I did for five weeks, you'd think I'd get hurt every day.  Not once.  The last move, the last rehearsal, I didn't even need it.  The camera tech guys did it. 
[01:42:00]  Slash my cornea.  I go down on the ground.  I'm fumbling around.  People think it's a joke.  Did you look over in the corner and the producers are paying her money?  Cash.  And nice.  There is some conspiracy theories.  Now, slashing the cornea, is that like getting a paper cut right on your eye?  Ah, stop.  It was very similar to that.  You know, at first you just think you're going to get right up, you know?  Yeah.  I go to the emergency room and doctor's like, you know, here's a couple of them.  You can go home, relax for a couple. 
[01:42:30]  I'm like, no, doc.  I've been waiting for this five weeks all summer, Labor Day, the whole thing.  Yeah, I'm going to be a big TV star.  It's my moment.  He's like, no, you can't dance.  I go, no, no.  I go, doc, say it ain't so.  There's got to be something you can do.  I got to dance.  He's like, this is crazy.  I'm like, you know, it's some old-time boy.  Yeah, there is something.  I'm going.  The show must go on.  Cha-cha.  Yeah.  I'm wearing spats in the emergency room.  Spats. 
[01:43:00]  Argue with the doctor that you have to dance.  He put a medicated contact lens over it.  Wow.  I put, like, a cork in my tear socket, like, opened it up.  I put an eye patch on.  Holy God.  And I went back to the show, and they said, we don't think you should dance.  You know, you should just get a, we'll play the videotape.  They weren't talking about the injury.  They were just saying, we don't think you should dance.  Yeah, you know.  Poor Jeff walking down the hallway, click, click, click, click. 
[01:43:30]  It was heartbreaking.  I danced anyway, against doctor's orders.  Oh, no.  You did something out there.  Yeah, it was like a telethon for spasmatic something.  And you couldn't see.  Didn't you have an eye patch on or something?  Or you took it off?  No, I had it on right until we danced, which was an even bigger mistake, because I had no  depth perception at all.  I was just wailing around.  Like, it was like, you would have thought, like, the Dead Kennedys or Husker Du was playing  or something the way I was dancing.  Like, one pupil is completely dilated, the other one is just laughing. 
[01:44:00]  I was so cockeyed.  I was seeing in some kind of weird TV.  The judges gave me three fours, a 12.  A 12.  And what can they give?  Out of 30.  Wow.  I got a lower score to when McCartney's ex-wife's leg flew off and, like, gave a concussion  to a cameraman.  I got a 12.  You'd think they would pump up your scores just a little bit.  Well, that old bad, Cloris Leachman got a 15, so I knew I was doomed.  Well, they wanted her.  Right from the get-go, they wanted Cloris Leachman to go a long way. 
[01:44:30]  That wasn't even dancing.  That was sassy.  I told her on the finale, they just dragged her lifeless body around the dance floor.  Like, Weekend at Bernie's, the musical.  That was a heartbreaker, I got to tell you.  I'm just starting to come out of it a little bit.  I felt bad for you.  And there you're, you know, you're on TV, so you probably want to look good.  And you got an eye patch on it.  Like, look at him.  And not only that, but my friends told me that I was safe.  You heard about that prank?  It was awful.  No, what happened?  Oh, no, really.  You know, Cousin Sal, who writes for the Jimmy Kimmel Show? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he's a good buddy of mine.  I used to go out with his sister.  We were writers together on the man show.  We're tight.  So, five minutes before, I'm in my ridiculous ascot and tuxedo.  You know, I got the doctor's orders approved.  You can go dance to the second show.  You know, it's like, here's my big comeback.  I got a better routine.  You know, I'm feeling that my eyes are starting to open up a little bit.  And this is like, this is awesome.  All right, here we go.  And five minutes before the live elimination show, I get a text message. 
[01:45:30]  You're safe.  Don't tell anybody.  Oh, no.  I literally jumped for joy and hit my head on the trailer.  I text back, are you sure?  Yes.  I, like, waltz over to my partner's trailer editor.  Editor, guess what?  Guess what?  We're safe.  How do you know?  I have a good source.  I know a guy.  My friend works at the network.  We're good, you know, because whoever gets cast off goes right to the Jimmy Kimmel show  that night for, you know, an interview.  So, I figured they got the inside.  This is incredible. 
[01:46:00]  And 12 couples are safe and get to dance.  It gets down to me and Kim Kardashian.  This is tough.  This is like, this is the greatest upset ever.  She's so popular.  She's so beautiful.  I know I'm safe.  She's going home.  Oh, no.  This is two hours of standing there with this eye patch and tuxedo, right?  So, I'm, like, stretching, limbering up, ready to go.  My family's in the audience with eye patches and waving. 
[01:46:30]  Warren Sapp has an eye patch on and a solidarity.  They all know I'm going.  But I think I'm safe.  Right.  You know, Sal's got me.  Sal wouldn't lie to you.  Not over something this important.  Right.  This is a guy who's, like, tortured me before.  He once spray-painted the punchlines to my jokes on my Porsche.  You know, like, he threw me in the pool at Adam Carolla's wedding.  I'm over it, and I'm thinking he would never mess with me in this moment.  Tom Bergeron.  We'll find out who's safe and who goes home after this message.  And you're kind of like, yeah, we'll find out. 
[01:47:00]  Producer comes over.  He's like, sure we will.  Producer comes over.  He looks at me.  I'm looking at Anthony, and he goes, okay, one of you is going to get eliminated.  Oh, it's just looking right at you.  I'm like, what are you looking at me for?  He's like, oh, you British guy.  He's all, like, unnerved by that.  Tom Bergeron comes back.  He's like, and the team with the lowest combined score is going home after just one dance.  Jeff and Edita.  You see my, like, I think I heard it wrong. 
[01:47:30]  It's so possible.  Wait, did they announce who's staying?  Is that what happened?  They just announced who's leaving.  Right.  What is it?  Like, everything's going through your head.  Did you say, no, because I heard.  I got a text that said we were safe.  All I could think about is, you know, Sal, F you.  Like, I can't, I don't know what to do.  You know, Samantha Harris runs over with a microphone.  Jeff, what are you feeling in this moment?  And I'm like, this is a nightmare.  No jokes.  Just, this is a nightmare.  I think I'm in an altered universe. 
[01:48:00]  Five weeks, eight hours a day learning this dance.  Now I'm not even going to do it?  Yeah.  It's like everything against stand-up.  Stand-up.  You think of something.  You go that night.  You know, here is five, five weeks.  I'm doing Labor Day.  I came in here over Labor Day.  It's just.  Yeah.  You'd worked on that a long time.  I still haven't fully wrapped my mind around it.  Now they tell me they changed the rules.  I'm like Al Gore, you know, everyone, everywhere I go in New York, I voted for you.  I voted for you.  Well.  It's like, well, thanks.  Your phone must have been broken.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  I got a, I got a, I had a better chance of winning the Westminster dog show than a dance  competition.  What happened to your dance partner?  Have you talked to her since?  Yeah, we stayed good friends and we danced in the finale together.  Oh, that's right.  They brought you back to do a little roast thing.  I saw that when I was away.  It was good.  That was big.  That was a nice, that was a nice, what do you call it, consolation.  Yeah, that was really huge.  You were up there doing your thing, beating the crap out of them.  What were some of your, you had some great lines.  I'm not going to attempt to do your lines.  I said I came at my.  You had some good Chloris Leachman abuse.  I got Chloris pretty good. 
[01:49:00]  I said, Chloris, sit down.  You had your 15 decades of fame.  God damn, that's funny.  Her scores from the judges should have been 9-1-1.  And then I went after the finalists, Warren Sapp, Brooke Burke, and Lance Bass.  And I said basically that Brooke Burke, I said, Brooke, you're the best at what you do.  What that is, we have no idea.  She looks great considering she just gave birth to Lance Bass' child or something like that.  Maybe the kid will come out of the womb in the closet on the same day. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, for prime time, 23 million people.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the most watched roast in history, I would imagine.  So I got to do what I do.  In the end, I broadened my fan base and lowered my dignity.  Sliced your eyeball.  Yeah, leave it to him.  He always gets the weird injuries, too.  I never forgot the story of you breaking your hip going ice skating.  I thought that that would have to be the worst one ever. 
[01:50:00]  He had a horrific break of his hip just ice skating.  I came back from Iraq first time, like completely without a scratch.  A week later, go ice skating with my six-year-old nephew on Bainbridge Island in Washington.  We're driving through this parking lot.  My sister goes, this is the worst hospital in Washington State.  No one ever wants to go there.  Oh, no.  We cut through that parking lot to go to this ice skating rink.  Two hours later, I'm getting surgery in that hospital. 
[01:50:30]  In the worst hospital.  On Christmas Eve, the nurses and doctors are wearing reindeer hats.  You know that's the B crew.  Yeah, the guy from Scrubs comes in.  That's the one, yeah.  Those are the ones, because the real doctors and everything would get the night off.  It was such a bad break.  They're operating on you two hours later.  Oh, Jeff Lipschultz.  That's my name on the thing.  You know, just some broken Jew.  They don't want to do this now.  And I never had this happen.  The doctor walks out, and he has an x-ray, and I still don't really know what's wrong 
[01:51:00]  with me.  And I won't curse on the radio, but he just, I never heard a doctor say this.  He goes, looks at my x-ray, he goes, young man, you are effed.  Effed.  Wow.  Really?  And I go, why?  He goes, I've never seen a broken hip on someone your age.  That's a great bedside manner there, Doc.  Thanks.  Well, he just got ripped out of his turkey dinner.  True.  He wasn't happy.  This is the middle of nowhere.  They're not used to blowing Thanksgiving, and they're here, you've got to operate on  this guy.  How bad does a broken hip feel?  It still hurts. 
[01:51:30]  It affected my dancing, you know.  At your age.  Enough with the dancing.  Well, I mean, you know.  That was a big shot for you, but come on.  But, you know.  Dancing.  Couldn't move my legs.  You know, I'll never be.  I walk a little funny.  I walk like Buddy Hackett.  I think you were just hoping to last a couple weeks.  I was hoping.  The truth is, the honest truth is, I had myself convinced I was going to go to the finals.  Oh, my God.  That's why this was so painful.  You do, though.  Like, any time you get yourself involved in something, you hope that it's going to, you  know, go the distance.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Dude, dude, we walked into that goddamn XFL game day thing thinking, all right, I think  we got some.  We could build something from this.  So confidence.  Canceled after three shows, was it, or two?  I don't remember.  Jesus.  Nah, we made a few.  I was in it.  I was in it.  We really thought it was the start of our network career, though.  Yeah.  And then you look back and go, what the hell was I thinking?  Of course it was a bomb.  Yeah.  I thought I was going to be like a showman, you know, a guy.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Prove that, you know, like the old comics who could sing and dance and tell jokes.  Yeah, of course.  It was a takeover.  You come out with a cane and a hat.  I had all kinds of routines in my head.  Tap, tap, tap.  Do a little line.  Tap, tap, tap the cane.  I had kung fu fighting all revved up for my next song.  I was going to be throwing karate kicks and, you know.  Jesus Christ.  You know.  What happened?  There are some really disturbed individuals.  Why?  What's going on next?  I'm watching a guy.  His name is Pathetic Male Slave.  Oh, we have.  He is on Pal Talk. 
[01:53:00]  Sure.  And he just put some, let's just say, a very sensitive part of the male body up on the table  where his keyboard is and hit it with a mallet.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  I just saw it.  He hit it with a mallet and he has a vice on the table that he's also been using on areas  that are much too sensitive for a vice to be used.  This guy, he's wearing a brassiere, I believe some type of nylon pantyhose, and he just smacked 
[01:53:30]  it with a mallet, he thinks it's like Tom and Jerry.  That was Voss.  That was Voss.  He was upset you made fun of his DVD.  Yeah, he's trying to.  Yeah, I'll show them.  I take the pain.  Is he going to do it again or what?  Oh, here he goes.  Here he goes.  He's going to do it again.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  Get it right.  Oh, he's adjusting the camera.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  This is for you, Bobby.  Look at those little turkey legs.  Well, he's wearing something.  I don't know.  What is he wearing?  Like, are those Burberry pedal pushers?  What are you wearing?  How do you even know the name of that?  I don't know.  He's going to Brock.  Oh, no.  He's not going to do it again?  Tease.  He's picking up the pieces.  Yeah.  Try to get him to open for me at Caroline's this weekend.  Caroline's.  Jeffrey Ross this weekend.  212-757-4100 for tickets.  I also want to say to Caroline's, thank you very much. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Because they came through after their crappy basket that they gave us.  Oh, here we go.  Bobby.  Hurry up.  Bobby.  Here he goes.  Mallet.  Mallet.  On the table.  And he's.  Here he goes.  He's lining up the shot, getting the courage up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, damn.  Why?  Mine was that small.  I'd hit it with a hammer, too.  I know.  The guy.  Gotta make it swell up.  He hates it.  I've seen this guy on Pal Talk. 
[01:55:00]  He comes into the rooms and he does odd things.  He hates that part of it because I guess he didn't get what he thought he should deserve.  Hopefully he's one of those hedge fund guys.  Yeah.  Hopefully he's the CEO of a company that is screwing us over right now.  Part of, what was it, AIG or whatever?  No, I'm not giving him an admin hat in my room, Steve from Bayshore.  He's literally beating his feet.  Yes.  Oh, hey.  Yes.  All right.  We're going to take a break. 
[01:55:30]  So, Jeffrey Ross, Caroline's Tonight, 212-757-4100 all weekend long.  And the new DVD, I'm sure you'll have it at Caroline's, right?  I'm selling it at Caroline's.  Jeffrey Ross, no offense, live from New Jersey.  A lot of our fans were at this taping, so they're going to want to pick up the DVD.  They're in the crowd at the cutaways.  It's kind of fun to see familiar faces.  All right.  We're going to finish up the show, at least this side of the show, next.  Opie and Anthony.  Got a full house today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Bob Kelly filling in for Jim Norton.  Norton's going to be at the Viper Room this weekend in Los Angeles. 
[01:56:00]  Very cool.  That is very cool for him.  It still makes me laugh.  What is making you laugh?  I just showed a video of the first shot I ever took off of the .50 cal, the Desert Eagle, at the range.  And Keith was actually doing the video.  And I just, boom, and fly backwards.  And we both start laughing our asses off.  You couldn't hold it back, huh?  You've got to learn how to shoot that damn thing.  I finally got it, you know, pretty down.  But I did, like, rip my finger open. 
[01:56:30]  I've got to wear a glove when I shoot that thing.  There's no way to keep from ripping your finger open.  There's so much power in that gun.  It's retarded to shoot.  Amazing.  It was a lot of fun, though.  We were making a lot of noise that day.  One guy was like, what, you got cannons?  Really?  Yeah.  It's just loud, guys.  I want to go shooting.  There's no need for this gun, either.  There's no practical use for that pistol, aside from the fact of just going to the range and  making a lot of noise with it. 
[01:57:00]  Or, you know, if you want to rip a giant hole in somebody.  I was going to ask you.  For no apparent reason.  How big is the hole?  Very big, going in, even bigger, coming out, depending on the ammo.  It's just, it'll take your arm right off.  Wait, here it is.  Shot somebody in the shoulder?  Yeah, here's the...  I've never seen this before.  No?  It's better with the sound, of course.  One more impressive.  One more impressive.  No, you don't have it.  All right.  Here it is, here.  Yeah.  And lining up the shot with his Desert Eagle, the first time he ever fired this thing. 
[01:57:30]  You must have been a little nervous right there.  Oh, wow.  Oh, it pushes you back pretty good.  It really is.  I was hoping to see one of those silly chick videos where it hits her in the head, the forehead.  And then I load up the rest of the mag and blast that one off.  But those are up on YouTube.  Yeah.  First shot from a 50 Cal Desert Eagle on YouTube.  My YouTube thing is, is it O-P-A-N-T-X-M?  Yeah.  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Okay.  That's my YouTube site. 
[01:58:00]  So go there and check these out.  Oh, here's the...  Whoa.  Wow.  That looks fun.  And then me and Keith start laughing.  Yeah.  I think I cursed.  Yeah.  Why do you wear that crazy looking do on your hair?  Oh, boy.  That was...  Okay.  That was when I had to wear it.  Jeffrey, you think you have problems.  Because I had stitches on the back of my head.  See, because I had a little swath taken out of the back of my hair. 
[01:58:30]  And then individually, the follicles had been cut out.  And they had placed them in my balding area on the back of my head.  Okay.  Individual follicles.  Don't say hair plugs.  So what happened?  You fell asleep and your friends did that to you?  Or you signed up for hair plugs?  Yeah, I actually...  Not plugs!  No, it was...  The glaring bald spot that was forming on the back of my head was bugging the crap out of me in pictures and video.  I'm sure.  It was like, so I checked out this medical hair restoration place and went there and in... 
[01:59:00]  They got fancy names.  Ten hours it took.  Ten hours.  They placed like 2,700 of these separate follicles.  You know why it took ten hours, right?  Why?  They probably dropped it on the floor and they were in a complete time.  No, they didn't!  It takes long because they don't take huge chunks like plugs.  They dissect this piece that they take out of you.  Each one is a separate follicle that is placed with the grain of your hair in the right direction, the right place. 
[01:59:30]  I hope they made a mistake and actually got some black dude's afro.  Just in the back of your head you have a big fro.  It wouldn't be much different than my natural hair was anyway.  Are you happy with it?  Are you happier with it?  Yeah, it's growing in like, you know, quite...  Actually, if you look here, you can see it's very short.  It's just like this and it's not growing in there and it's still a little, you know, raw.  But, like, that's part of the receding thing.  Because I didn't care about the front that much, but they threw some in there. 
[02:00:00]  It was like the back.  You just get this shining crown on video.  And video, it looks even worse.  Of course.  It's a little shiny.  Does it hurt?  Did it hurt?  Like a mother eff...  No, they novocaine the hell out of your head.  And, um...  I love you guys that...  But they gotta poke...  They gotta poke, like, thousands of holes in your head.  Good for you, man.  Good for you for being honest.  And then they placed him in there.  I needed follicles.  I was...  My follicles were falling out.  Every guy needs them.  You had the guts to do it.  That's it.  I figured, you know something? 
[02:00:30]  I got the means.  I wasn't happy with the way pictures looked.  I'm in the public eye.  And I have pictures that are taken.  They're put up on websites and stuff like that.  And it's like...  And there I am from the back, just looking like, oh, boy.  And I can't concentrate on the rest of the picture.  I was watching our Letterman appearance, and I couldn't even concentrate on it.  They did an over-the-shoulder shot, and all I'm thinking is, look at the big bald spot.  So fast.  But no one else was saying that.  I didn't want a wig.  He doesn't want to wait for people to say that. 
[02:01:00]  He's in front of the game.  Proactive on this one.  Yeah.  You didn't want to get a wig?  No.  I wasn't going to get...  It's called a hair system.  What it is, they tie it to your existing hair, and then it grows out like a parachute after a while.  You come home, and one of your girls would be combing it like a toy.  Yeah.  I missed you.  So I just figured I'd run my fingers through your hair while you were at work.  She braided it and dyed it different colors.  Women do all kinds of extensions and stuff. 
[02:01:30]  Why shouldn't you feel confident?  That's it.  You're a big star.  Thank you, Jeffrey.  Why is Jeffrey such a big fan of this procedure?  I've never done it, but I always...  No, Jeffrey's got a good head of hair on.  Yeah, he does.  I get a bald spot in the back, and sometimes when you're going to be on a TV show,  you ask them to put a little powder back there or something?  Oh, they put the powder or spray it or something.  You don't have to worry about it.  And that was it at the wedding.  Because at Ope's wedding, I was supposed to have this done the Thursday before we went on vacation.  Like, the second we went on vacation, I was supposed to have this done.  And then I went like, uh-oh. 
[02:02:00]  I think actually Keith said, hey, dude, you got something to do Saturday, huh?  Remember Ope's wedding?  I'm like, oh, crap.  So I put it off until the Tuesday.  So I went in Tuesday to have it done.  And at the wedding, because it's a black tie event, you can't wear a hat.  So there I am, and I got Voss and Patrice behind me.  And all I'm thinking is, they're making fun of my hair.  Of course.  And then I talked to them later, and they're like, I didn't even think about it.  Don't make yourself so important. 
[02:02:30]  I'm not thinking about your stupid bald spot.  But, you know, that's all you think about sometimes.  It's like, who's behind me?  You look outside and see, is it windy out?  Is my hair going to blow the wrong way?  Like, it's just, it's awful.  So I just didn't want to deal with that anymore.  I'm glad you have the hat on now, because that bandana was...  Well, the do-rag was because...  You look like a short order cook.  The hat, like, hurt.  It hurt the back.  It looked worse than a short order cook.  Frankie and Johnny, we got two Sunnyside coming up.  I like gangsta stuff.  There was one night I was on Pal Talk in one of the rooms and, you know, chatting and stuff like that. 
[02:03:00]  And I was cleaning the Eagle.  I was cleaning the Desert Eagle.  And they were just like, hey, Holmes, what are you going for, a drive-by?  It just, like, it looks really bad.  But, yeah, after they took the stitches out of the back where they take the...  Because they take a swath out of there, and then they just pull it together and sew it shut.  Interesting.  So it's like, you know, here's an extra thing of hair.  Are you going to have a bad scar back there? 
[02:03:30]  No.  You see those guys every once in a while, now they shave down their hair because they gave up on the hair plug thing.  And then they got the big scar on the back, too.  They've gotten so much better with, like, every type of surgery with scarring.  Yeah.  They just know how to make incisions and stitches now for some reason.  I remember looking at people's old, like, appendix scars, and it looked like a mortar wound or something.  A sucking chest wound from the NOM.  Now it's just amazing.  I guess they know how to, like, cut and stitch now.  So it's nothing back there.  And then the hair covers it up anyway. 
[02:04:00]  Do you know, the hair is genetically engineered not to fall out in the back here.  That's why you get that horseshoe baldness.  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's just, it's genetically engineered.  It won't fall out because of male pattern baldness.  Maybe for, you know, disease or something like that.  But that's why they take it from that area and they plop it up there.  They put it all wherever, you know.  How many times did you, did you watch those commercials and those late night shows?  Like, it was like a series, like Dexter.  You know something?  I never watched those.  Like, Dexter?  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Did you actually, TiVo, like, Bosley Medical?  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  No, I've seen it, but I never really sat and watched the whole thing.  You know, Patrice, when I first started losing my hair, he actually, he gave them my address and name.  Son of a bitch.  In the mail, I got the Bosley, the whole information.  And they were calling me every week, trying to get me in for an appointment.  No, I went in for a consultation in, like, Melville.  But they do the surgery here in Manhattan.  And it's not Bosley, by the way. 
[02:05:00]  No, no.  It was medical hair restoration.  Which is better.  Of course it's better.  I didn't mean to bring it up with the do-rag.  No, no, that's fine.  I'm glad you told everybody.  No, we've been talking about it for, you know, since I had it done.  But, yeah, they do it right over there.  But when I went for the consultation, you could tell the guy I was talking to, like, you couldn't tell by looking at it.  But you just knew he was going to, at one point, go, by the way, I had the procedure done.  Can you tell?  Let me put it on him.  No.  It was, you know, it was great.  So they showed you, like, he had it, but they- 
[02:05:30]  He had it.  And it's like, he goes, he told me, he goes, look as close as you want.  He goes, go as close as you want to my head.  Pull on it.  He goes, do anything.  He goes, stick your hand down my pants.  The problem there.  I don't know why he said that, but he's-  And the problem there, he had his secretary do it, though, because he can't do it to himself.  All right, just follow my instructions.  We'll get through this together.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  We're going to stop.  No, no, no, you're doing good.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  No, so, you know, that was a good selling point. 
[02:06:00]  And then they show you the video.  They show you, like, the infomercial, I guess, that runs.  It's like, I was going bald and didn't know what to do.  And then they have sports stars and-  Well, the front part scares me.  Things like that.  Does that, they, I haven't, well, maybe-  The hairline?  Yeah, maybe I'm looking at guys that, they did have it done and I can't tell anymore.  They also say-  But you always could tell the guys that had it done because the front of it looks horrible.  But they always say this with any type of cosmetic surgery or anything like this.  If someone has it done very well, you just won't even notice.  You won't think about it.  Right.  It's people that are kind of like, you're like, something's up over there. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  I was at the Major League Baseball winter meetings in Vegas.  I was doing a gig unrelated and all the retired baseball players have these awful hair pieces.  Just bad wigs.  Can't let it go.  It's like, why wear a wig?  I just couldn't understand.  Because they don't have 10 grand money bags?  What?  They do, though.  They do.  They do.  That's just it.  The way they wouldn't man up for the pain is what it is.  Yeah.  It is.  It's 10 hours of thousands of times they poke your head. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  But you know what, though?  Those guys, some guys, I mean, the guys who have nothing up.  You had a bald spot and a receding hairline.  Right, right, right.  And, I mean, some guys, I mean, totally bald?  You can't do that.  Yeah, that would be-  I've seen-  It's like laying down sod.  I know.  I've seen pictures of guys that were really bald.  Yeah.  And they put it, they do a good job of putting enough in there where it fills it out, but  then you're still kind of camouflaging with what you have and- 
[02:07:30]  Can you do it case by case, basically?  Yeah, yeah.  Can you dye it, though?  Like, when it grows back, you'll be able to dye it.  You can do it.  It's your, like they say, it's your own hair.  You can do whatever you want.  You're going to be able to swim?  You're going to be able to swim?  Maury's wigs don't come off.  All right, we got to get out of here.  So, we got Jeffrey Ross, Caroline's through the weekend, 212-757-4100.  Bobby, thank you so much.  RobertKelleyLive.com for all your dates.  Yeah, go to there.  Go to my MySpace, actually, on my Facebook for my dates.  I don't update my Robert Kelly Live. 
[02:08:00]  All right, and if you don't see Jeffrey Ross at Caroline's this weekend, you should, but  if you don't, because you've got other things going on or you live far away, it's got a  DVD out called No Offense.  How do the people get this, Jeffrey?  They can pick it up on Amazon or almost any store around them.  All right, right on.  Thank you, fellas.  And if you're listening here in New York on this fine rock station, don't go anywhere.  No commercials.  We're going right into rock and roll for you.  And we're walking to the other joint.  Some of that rock and roll.  Have a good weekend.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Shoe. 
[02:08:30]  Moving right along for a Friday.  What happened to Jeffrey Ross? 
[02:09:00]  What did he do?  Is he a big star now?  He doesn't want to be doing the potty mouth version?  It's like, yeah, he doesn't want to burn any bridges.  He wants a clean network show to do or something.  Yeah, I'm sure.  He doesn't change that much.  He's like when Sinatra used to go on Carson.  You know, they just come in and then go, I got to go.  I got to go.  Where are you going?  I just got to go.  I got to go.  Got to fly to Vegas.  Do something, something.  Yeah.  Well, showbiz things. 
[02:09:30]  We do have D.L.  Hughley coming in from D.L.  Hughley breaks the news.  One of our newer friends.  He's on CNN Saturday and Sunday nights at 10 p.m.  What's CNN doing?  They're doing like.  Well, I think I think because of the Daily Show, I think people are realizing, OK, we don't  have to take ourselves so seriously around the clock.  With our network, we can.  Yeah, but that's a little bit.  That's on the comedy channel.  And CNN is not comedy.  Well, sometimes.  Right. 
[02:10:00]  Not at 930 when the market opens.  I know that.  I'm waiting to see my my GM and Ford shares just go right down the old crapper.  I knew I should have just punched out yesterday.  I knew it.  I got greedy.  Greedy.  Well, they're not going for the bailout or this version of it.  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think eventually they will.  Yeah.  That's why.  I think we should do something with intern David today.  David.  Intern David.  Like slap him around.  Yeah, we could do something.  What's up, David?  Here he comes. 
[02:10:30]  I haven't spoken with David in quite some time.  Hi, David.  Hello.  You know this song?  Yes, I certainly do.  Yeah.  Was it played at your bar mitzvah?  Yes, it was.  Yeah.  And what's the traditional thing to do when this song is being played?  To have a dance.  Yeah.  Dance around in a circle.  Oh, you do that circle thing.  Yeah.  And then you're kicking and stuff?  Yes. 
[02:11:00]  Ah, that must have looked ridiculous.  Yes.  Yeah.  Just saying.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  He's just ridiculous.  I know.  I love David.  Sam, use my mic, baby.  Intern David!  David is, um...  David's made himself very comfortable.  Sam, use my mic.  Here.  You feel very comfortable here now, don't you?  Yes, I certainly do.  Yeah.  I can tell.  Some interns, they feel comfortable and they act one way.  Others, like you, feel comfortable and they act another way.  Okay. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  In what way do I act?  You got some kind of entitlement thing that is going on.  I don't really catch a lot of the stuff, but I catch enough peripheral intern stuff  to kind of see what's going on.  You got like an entitlement thing going on a little bit.  It's running rampant off, you know, away from the show is, you know, so you are picking  up on it quite good.  I'm picking up on it?  Yeah, I thought so.  Yeah.  Nothing, you know, doesn't affect me, so I don't give a shit.  He's just peacocking.  He's peacocking, that's all.  He's peacocking.  He's peacocking. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, me and Sam figured out he's watching The Pickup Artist on VH1 and he's picking  up some stuff.  What?  Isn't that it?  You watch The Pickup Artist?  No.  There you go.  You know what I noticed?  Not the whole first season.  I don't consider myself, I don't consider this a military type atmosphere.  I don't consider myself an officer amongst enlisted people, things like that.  But I noticed something this morning and that's what kind of got me on this.  Every morning, I look at the clock and go, all right, it's time to go from the office 
[02:12:30]  into the studio.  So I grab my newspapers, tuck them under my arm, grab my little Gatorade, and make my  way into the studio.  As I'm walking into the studio, it's a very short walk, in the doorway, here comes David  at the same time I'm coming in.  Now, like I said, I don't consider myself an officer, I'm not looking for a salute, I'm  not looking for anything.  But he plowed right through, pretty much like a get the fuck out of my way kind of a thing. 
[02:13:00]  Instead of like, all right, aunt, gotta get into the studio, perhaps I should step aside  a little bit, make room, you know, for me to come in and take my seat.  Why do you have to go in at that time there, David?  It didn't matter about going in or out, it was just how he's cutting you off and stuff.  Yeah, it was like, what's that about?  Like, you really didn't seem like you, you just kind of barreled right through me there. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, man.  Right?  Good answer.  Shouldn't have done that.  Yeah, that's going to be some demerits, right?  No, yeah.  That just got me thinking, you know, that's a guy that's comfy.  That's it.  Because some of the interns, they step aside like, you know, whoa!  They get out of your way, they run away from you.  Well, it's our fault, though.  We just hired a 38-year-old intern.  David must feel really safe in this position.  The pickings are slim.  We're like Nazi Germany at the end of the war. 
[02:14:00]  We have children and old men.  This is, like, in war times, this is what you get.  All the real men go and fight the battles, and then you still have manly jobs back home,  and you've got to, like, pick guys like David and 38-year-old dudes that should be working.  I'd rather have Rosie the Riveter.  As interns, right.  So, David, how much longer do you have this internship?  I'm really not sure.  I'm going to stay for a whole other semester. 
[02:14:30]  Oh!  Oh, look at that.  I'm not going anywhere.  Ah, all right.  I'm sticking around at least until May.  Yeah?  Sam?  The best part about this whole thing is that now David's at the point where he's training people.  Oh, is he?  So, we have so few interns that it will be one new intern and David are all the interns.  So, you've really worked yourself up the totem pole here.  Definitely, yes.  With two interns, you have seniority.  Over two interns, yes.  Well, what's funny is that we still have some interns that are senior to David here, 
[02:15:00]  and he thinks that, I guess because of his celebrity status on the show, he doesn't have to do anything like, you know.  Who was telling me?  Ron was telling me a story.  Hip-Hop Ron was telling me how somebody, he was doing something, he needed David to do something,  so he said, David, can you do this?  And David was just like, no, no, I'm doing something right now.  And he's like, no, I need you to do this.  He's like, well, I'm busy.  And it's like, I had to explain to him after the show that day, I was like, look, you know,  Hip-Hop Ron is technically your, you know, you have to, there's a pecking order here, 
[02:15:30]  and if he asks you to do something, you have to do it.  Let's get Hip-Hop Ron on the air.  Ron, what do you got to add to that?  Yeah, David also, like around 8.45, 8.50, he likes to let everybody know the show should be over.  And this morning, he's like, it's 8.50, the show should be over.  So I'm like, okay, go tell Opie.  He goes, no, Stump Rain will tell him, Stump Rain always lets him know what's going on.  Go tell Opie.  Could you imagine David coming in and going, Opie, the show should be over.  You're giving him like the wrap-it-up sign. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, wrap it up.  I'd be arrested for a hate crime.  Is that a beard?  It's a chin strap.  What is that?  A chin strap?  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  What's wrong?  I don't know.  It just looks like you...  Didn't you have one of those at one point?  I think you might have.  No, I didn't have, I had like five of them.  It's one of the looks the kids are going with today.  Is that what it is today?  The kids.  It's called the chin strap?  The kids.  Uh-oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Ron also shampoos and conditions it, gets his eyebrows done, and shaves his pubes. 
[02:16:30]  Just in case anybody was wondering.  All right.  So he sucks cock, is basically what you're saying.  All but that, yeah.  That's a fucking cum catcher, is what it is.  Is that what he's got on Match.com?  You really get your eyebrows done?  Yeah, get them threaded.  You can tell.  You do...  Yeah, I gotta go today and get them done for tonight.  Why?  What?  What's tonight?  What's tonight?  My friend's DJing at a bar downtown, so I'm going down there.  But they do look done already.  Why do you have to go again now?  They're growing in a little bit.  Wait, can you explain threading?  I've never... 
[02:17:00]  You've never seen this horror show in the malls?  I've seen it in the mall, but...  Holy fuckaroni.  I still don't know what they're doing.  Dude, it's like a couple of threads, like...  Dental floss.  Like floss, yeah.  You've got fake hair in there.  And it's wound together.  No, no.  It's wound together, and they do it in a certain way where they're pulling the hairs out.  The hairs get caught in the two spiraled pieces of twine, and then it rips the hair out.  Oh, they're pulling the hair out.  Yeah, a little less better than waxing.  I thought they were adding a little bit.  So it's not like waxing, where they put wax on there, but you're just yanking it.  No, I just get them fitted, like, on the side. 
[02:17:30]  You can tell, because your eyebrows do not extend past the corners of your eyes, where  on most guys, it's at least that far.  Like, we have old Muppet face, Sam, who has...  Sam's like a fucking, like, Otto and George, like...  You've got, like, George eyebrows.  I like Sam's eyes, bro.  I like your eyebrows.  Of course you do, you flaming motherfucker.  The natural.  That's not gay.  You were less gay.  You were watching him suck his own knuckle today. 
[02:18:00]  I was making him suck his own knuckle.  Now, the thing is, you can tell that you have very feminine eyebrows.  All right, thank you.  I'm not, you know, not as a bash or anything, but I guess having them done, because they  come to a point at the corners...  Yeah, when you get them done and then the chin strap looks, you look nice and fresh when  you go out and stuff.  Yeah, huh?  What about the body and the personality, though?  Oh, I have the personality.  Oh, shit.  I think he's got... 
[02:18:30]  I think he's got...  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Hair maintenance gets a little crazy as, you know, you get a little older.  Yeah, you two fighting about facial hair is just ridiculous.  Danny's is a picture of...  Danny's going for the mutton chops, though, which is kind of cool.  Yeah, I was going for, for the last, like, three weeks, I was going for a Wolverine beard.  Wolverine.  Where that's, like, the full beard with no mustache.  Right, right.  But it just wasn't happening, so I went back old school to chops.  Now you're, like, Tony Stark a little bit, too.  Yeah, but I was...  Walt Frazier, 1970. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, but I was rocking these chops forever.  Yeah, yeah, I was.  It's not like it's new.  Yeah, but with the other facial hair, it looks like the battery on your razor died.  Isn't that a panic moment when you start hearing, meh, on the razor, and you're like,  I know I got no batteries.  You're pulling shit out of your remote.  Trying to fix your fucking beard.  Well, the worst is when you run out of shaving cream, and then you have to try to improvise  shaving cream.  Soap.  Yeah, like you're going through...  I'll go through my medicine cabinet, seeing, like, what lotions are in there, to see what  I can improvise. 
[02:19:30]  The lotion does a good job.  I could probably shave with cocoa butter.  What's some of that other shaving cream substitutes we got?  Uh, Capitone.  Mayonnaise.  Peanut butter.  Barbecue sauce.  And then sometimes you think that if you could just, like, get your face wet enough,  it'll lubricate just as well, you end up just cutting your whole throat open when you go to  do it.  Eyebrows are an odd thing, though, because you see some people, and I'm not talking about 
[02:20:00]  you, Sam, because you're a young gentleman, and you just have big eyebrows.  But I don't understand how older guys can walk around.  When do you give up on your eyebrows?  Like, where it's sticking out like fucking hedges growing out of your eyes.  I trim that shit, Dan.  Like, that's pretty much the only thing I do.  Yeah, you got to.  You got to.  But at some point, someone just gives up and says, fuck it.  You ever see people that have just hairs growing out their nose? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  And ears?  And everywhere else?  It's like fucking nose, ear hair, eyebrows.  Everywhere you're not supposed to have hair.  I have hair in my ears.  And it's, you know, I had like a couple hairs, and then my wife plucked.  Let me get that.  And she kept plucking them, and now it's like a hobbit.  You don't take a fucking one of those little razor things and go.  No, no.  And then up the nose.  No.  You got to get rid of like that fucking nasty hair.  But I don't do the razor in my ear.  Isn't that dangerous? 
[02:21:00]  No, it's made for the fucking thing.  What do you think I'm doing?  It's not going to go all the way in.  I'm putting a goddamn meat slicer in my ear.  It's a fucking, it's made to go in there.  And it dows it.  It dows down 200 points.  Opening bell.  What?  And we're off.  GM down $1.54 down 76 cents.  Holy shit.  Oh, Anthony.  What happened?  Oh, it's a good buying opportunity.  What happened?  Shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, damn.  So, are we done with intern David?  Oh, we are so, well. 
[02:21:30]  When's Hanukkah, David?  You're just having Hanukkah?  Yeah, what's going on for Hanukkah?  Hanukkah is not for a couple weeks.  It's like at the end of December this year.  Because sometimes it falls right there on Christmas.  This year it is falling over Christmas.  No, is it?  Yes.  Oh.  So we got Hanukkah happening on the 25th.  That's one of the days of Hanukkah.  When does it start?  So you guys get the jump on us?  Yeah.  You Jews get the jump on the Catholics?  It's usually early December.  What the hell?  It's different.  We're getting the attention.  Hey, why is it different every year? 
[02:22:00]  So they have to invite for a guitar holiday?  Why is it different?  It's different every year because it's a different calendar.  The calendars aren't in sync.  It's a lunar calendar for the Jews.  What?  So the calendars are different.  But why can't you just say Hanukkah starts on December 23rd?  Every year.  Every year.  Just use like, you know, the civilized fucking calendar of the Catholic.  Well, we're Jewish.  We're different.  You guys have a floating calendar?  We certainly do.  It's the same on the Jewish calendar.  It's the same, but the calendars don't match up.  The Jewish and the Christian calendar, those calendars don't match up, so they're different. 
[02:22:30]  Do you get stuff every day, like good presents or just shit presents?  I've always heard from every year when I was growing up, all I heard about were the Jews  bitching about their shitty gifts that they got for Hanukkah.  Because they'd get like little trinkets and things that like meant something.  Yeah, like dreidels and stuff.  And meanwhile, you know, us Catholic kids, holy shit, the fucking trees loaded with, you  know, GI Joes, and I got a GI Joe space capsule and fucking bicycles and shit like that. 
[02:23:00]  And then the Jews friends are like, what'd you get?  Oh, I got a dreidel.  I got Hanukkah gelt.  Yeah, something like that.  What?  Gelt?  What is a gelt?  It's like money, but it's like a chocolate covered money type thing.  It's like a little coin.  It's like a little coin.  It's a chocolate coin covered in gold, not the other way around.  I've seen those where you peel the gold off.  Yeah.  And wow, that is really a shitty fucking Hanukkah thing.  He did make it sound like you eat the chocolate and then there's a fucking gold doubloom underneath. 
[02:23:30]  And there's a fucking Krugerrand inside.  Do you try to deposit it in your bank account?  So, yeah, Hanukkah, Hanukkah is always, what's like the best thing you ever got for Hanukkah?  Yeah.  Because Hanukkah sucks.  Yeah, it does.  It's not that, Hanukkah is not like, like really that like special of a holiday for Jews.  Like they get presents and stuff, but it's not that like holy of a holiday.  So then why don't you leave us alone and let us celebrate Christmas?  It's like you guys Christmas is like one of your most holiest holidays.  But you butted in, you butted in on our Christmas and now we have to like fucking have holiday 
[02:24:00]  this and holiday.  We can't say Merry Christmas.  It's Happy Holidays.  And you go to the store and they don't want a fucking Christmas tree without a fucking  menorah in there.  If it's not that important, then lay back a little bit.  Let us enjoy ourselves.  Like your Christmas is one of your most important holidays.  Hanukkah is one of the least important holidays of all the Jewish holidays.  Wow.  You guys, listen, you guys, we, ours is Jesus.  Something happened to Jesus.  They don't believe in Jesus.  We don't give a shit.  We want presents.  You guys actually believe in whatever the fuck Hanukkah was. 
[02:24:30]  Like whatever religious stuff was.  Give us a little background so that people could call up and say,  you're a dumb fuck that doesn't know what you're talking about.  That's right.  They will.  They'll call up this.  Yeah.  What is Hanukkah?  The festival of lights.  The festival of lights.  Yep.  It was in the, uh, when the Romans were, uh, or is it the Greeks?  When the Greeks were, uh, in the Greek times, uh, the Greeks destroyed the Holy Temple  and the Jews thought that there was going to be no, no lights left because they destroyed  the Holy Temple.  Are you Jewish, miss?  Oh, and you, and you still know because she's shaking her head.  Yeah.  We got a live audience today.  We got a, we got a Jew in here. 
[02:25:00]  We got two Jews right there.  Is there a Jew in the house?  Yeah.  Look at the curly hair.  Bring in the Jews.  Uh, she, so something happened with the temples?  The Holy Temple.  When the Greeks destroyed the Holy Temple, the Jews thought there wasn't going to be enough  light to last for, to last them through the morning, but there was one pitcher of oil  and the oil burned for eight days.  Wait, wait, I thought that was Passover.  Yeah, we already told the story.  No, that's Hanukkah.  No, that's Hanukkah.  Wait a minute.  I thought the oil was supposed to last for a certain amount of days.  No, they thought it was only going to last for, for one day. 
[02:25:30]  That's why you light the candle.  Yeah, and it lasted for eight days.  So you light a candle and remember each eight days that the oil burns for.  Yeah, but did they fuck up?  Was there more oil than they thought?  Yeah, that's what everybody thought.  No, it was the same amount of oil, but it lasted.  Longer than they thought.  No, someone was replacing the oil while the rest of you guys slept.  Yeah, something happened.  And now we got this whole thing going on.  There's probably a Catholic guy, too.  The fucking gauge was broke on the little lamp.  Why do you guys go to...  Fucking fuel gauge, you didn't tap it.  Why do you guys go to temple if you believe that when you're dead, you're dead and there's  nothing else? 
[02:26:00]  Do Jews believe that?  Don't they?  No, Jews don't believe that.  No.  What do you guys believe in as far as afterlife?  I thought they have...  Our goal is to be with Jesus at the right hand of Jesus.  What do you Jews believe in as far as, you know, where you go after death?  You know, Jews believe that the Jews go up to God when they die.  Up to God?  Yes.  Your God?  Yes.  Your God.  Correct.  And what is your heaven like? 
[02:26:30]  Because ours is a bunch of, like, clouds and there's pearly gates and we have wings.  There's angels.  Angels.  Free movie theaters.  We get wings.  A lot of free movies.  Jesus is walking around so we can talk to Jesus.  Yeah.  We have halos and we walk around and everything's cool.  What is this?  What's Jewish heaven like?  It's a good question.  Hmm.  Yeah, I'm really not sure about that.  Wow.  Hey, does your God have abs like our God?  Yeah.  Is he, like, in shape?  Our God really is in shape. 
[02:27:00]  I don't think...  Jesus is in some fine shape in every picture.  Our God rules.  Yeah.  Is your God, like, Buddha, that fat fuck?  Or is it, like...  I'm really not sure.  There's really no pictures of our God.  Like, you guys have pictures.  We really don't have any pictures.  So what do you think he looks like?  I really don't know what God looks like, to be honest.  I really don't know.  We haven't...  I picture a lot of white hair, curly white hair, beards, things like that.  That could be.  Yeah, something, like, very godly.  Yep.  Is that what the Jewish God... 
[02:27:30]  Looks like Moses?  Yeah, something like Moses.  Yeah, something like Moses or, yeah.  I picture, like, Ben Stein.  Really?  Yeah.  Hello, David.  David, welcome to heaven.  You're in heaven now.  Do you have red eyes?  Everything is half price.  We got Big Dick Dave singing.  You want to hear this real fast?  Who's Big Dick Dave?  That's Big Dick Dave.  Oh, right.  That was my name for, like, one week.  Well, the Big Dick part didn't really pan out too well for you.  Does he have a big pan?  Do you have a big piece? 
[02:28:00]  We assumed.  Well, we just assumed.  I never really panned out that name, so I'm going to just intern David.  Yeah, you're just David.  You're whatever we want to call it.  David.  I fucking hope he's getting evil.  He's getting tired.  You'd all be dead if it wasn't for my son, David.  Right?  Someone is saying.  Independence Day.  Carl L. from Jersey saying that their heaven is the inside of a bank vault.  Oh.  The inside of a bank?  Uh-oh.  You know, because of that whole money thing.  Oh, I know.  I got it.  That's bad.  It's very stereotypical. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Here's intern David singing.  Hello.  This is David Freed recording Katy Perry's Hot and Cold.  Take number one.  You change your mind like a girl changes clothes.  Yeah, you PMS like a chick I would know.  Wow.  And you always think, always speak, cryptically. 
[02:29:00]  I should know that you're no good for me.  Oh.  Cause you're hot and you're cold.  You're yes and you're no.  You're in and you're out.  You're up and you're down.  You're wrong when it's right.  It's black and it's white.  We fight, we break up.  We kiss, we make up.  You, you don't really want to stay, no. 
[02:29:30]  You, you don't really want to go.  Oh.  Hot and you're cold.  You're yes and you're no.  You're in and you're out.  You're up and you're down.  How is that?  Perfect.  I think I didn't do too bad on the song.  Yeah, wow.  That's wonderful, David.  You were right there.  Yeah.  He's just so uncomfortable.  I know.  Yeah.  I'm looking at him and I'm just like, I just feel uncomfortable.  Yeah, I'm very comfortable.  For the last, for the last like hour of the CBS show, David decided he was kind of done with 
[02:30:00]  his intern responsibilities because there's a certain young lady who's outside that David  has an affinity for that he was talking to for about an hour.  Oh, is there?  David likes to fancy himself as a ladies man, I think.  A lot of times the ladies come in.  David's the first one over there to spark up a conversation.  Yeah.  Yes.  There he is.  All right.  What's up, buddy?  Did I make up for your breakfast today?  Yeah, you did.  All right.  How old are you again?  38.  38.  38-year-old intern. 
[02:30:30]  What happened?  Who died?  Did everybody, like your family die in a car crash that you caused and now you're just  trying to fucking start a new life?  Trying to start over again.  I said, you hit it right in the head.  Is it really?  You're the cause of it?  Well, where were you before this?  I was an electrician.  You were an electrician.  Did you get laid off?  Yep.  Many times.  And it was just a fact of getting laid off many times.  Tried to start anew.  Yeah.  And I said to my wife, I'm going to start something new.  I want to try to do something I want to do.  Really?  Yeah.  And then you want to be on radio?  I would like to be.  And while you're having fun with us, who's paying the bills? 
[02:31:00]  My wife.  Wow.  What does she do?  She works for Prudential.  So knock on whatever this is.  She's knocking it.  Her company is in good standings.  Well, let me tell you something.  You were in the trades.  Yes.  And then you decided to go into radio.  Yes.  If you get successful, you're going to have to kill your wife because she will take you  for everything.  Yeah, but now she's worried I could kill her.  And I, you know.  I tell you. 
[02:31:30]  That's true.  You know.  I forgot about that.  You picked the perfect time to get into radio.  Yes.  That's what I understand.  Ah, yeah.  They're firing everybody.  Yes.  They're firing guys with 30 years of experience.  Yeah.  Actually, he's not.  It probably is.  They're hiring him for a lot less.  Fucking mooks with no experience to just push a button.  They're going to fuck you.  You'll probably get a job tomorrow.  I hope so.  Probably the fucking king of tamper in a fucking month.  I'm not going to be anybody's job boyfriend.  What's going to be your radio name?  I haven't even thought of that yet.  I'm only here for three days.  You haven't thought of your radio name?  Not yet, no. 
[02:32:00]  What would be your name for me?  Give me one.  Bucket tits.  I could live with that.  I could live with that.  I'd be called worse.  I would have to listen to Bucket tits every day.  See that?  I already have one listener.  You got Bucket tits and crazy days.  That's a good show.  That's pretty good, man.  All right.  What do you think?  Jets, Bills.  I see the Jets.  I'm a season ticket holder.  I'm going Sunday.  The way they've been playing the last few weeks, it's hard to say.  And the Bills, they've sucked.  They killed the Jets.  They sucked out the joint the last couple of weeks. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, they have, but they always kill the Jets.  Is it going to bum you out when the Patriots come back to take the...  Yeah, no one's going to bum me is in the last week when Chad Penney comes back and takes  us away.  That's what's going to kill me.  Oh, that's a way to be positive.  I'm a Jet fan my whole life.  Yeah, I'm with you.  It's in bread.  All right.  38-year-old intern.  What's your real name?  What's your real name?  Oh, Scott.  Scott.  Oh, it's Scott.  Scott what?  Scott Como.  Como?  Yes.  I know.  I've been hearing it my whole life.  What nationality is, Scott? 
[02:33:00]  Italian-Irish.  Italian-Irish.  Me too.  You look like me around seven months ago.  Yeah, exactly.  This is a reminder not to go back to where you were, Bobby.  I know.  You gave up the bread?  Is that what it was?  Yeah, a little more than that.  Jesus Christ.  He looks exactly like me.  I kind of got that feeling in the morning that you gave up the bread.  Look at that fucking stomach.  Let me see that.  That is a good gut you got going there.  What the fuck?  God, he's got a little beard.  You can't pull your pants up over your belly button.  The belly button is the actual line to say... 
[02:33:30]  That's it.  That's the stop.  That's the equator.  You have pulled your underwear up mid-belly, and your pants...  Your t-shirt hides it, but your pants...  That's why I wear the t-shirt out.  Your pants are like William Frawley's.  It's not the 18th century, you asshole.  Let me see that again.  Pull your pants down out of your belly.  Why?  That's where it goes.  Because it's uncomfortable like this.  It's uncomfortable like that.  Then get pants that fit you, buddy.  That situation's uncomfortable.  I have to get...  All right. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  You got the boxer shorts, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Boxers, not briefs.  The briefs, the elastic, your fat stomach sweats it...  That's what it is.  It goes over.  ...and folds it over?  Yeah.  That's it.  Just keep ruining elastics?  All right, I get you.  I'm with you, kid.  We got to take a quick break, because I see a real star waiting to get on our show today.  D.L.  Hughley is waiting among the listeners.  Quick break, and we'll continue with D.L.  Hughley.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got D.L.  Hughley in studio.  Of course, D.L.  Hughley breaks the news on CNN Saturday and Sunday at 10 p.m. 
[02:34:30]  That's right.  Oh, man.  Thank you.  That's nice.  Before we get into this, Bobby was just telling an Amsterdam story, because I told Bobby,  he was talking about Amsterdam, and they're trying to close down a lot of that crap.  Which is a sad day.  The Red Light District, or whatever it's called over there.  That's the best thing ever.  Trying to get rid of some of the pot places, and some of the window girls, and all that.  And you said you went there with Patrice O'Neill?  Yeah, I was there two days before with Keith Robinson.  Patrice showed up.  We already had two days of banging chicks in windows. 
[02:35:00]  Of course.  Patrice shows up.  Are they as hot as they say?  At nighttime.  Oh, it's just like strip clubs on Long Island?  Yeah.  You have to go to the...  Day strippers.  Day strippers versus night strippers?  You have to go to the tourist one.  You can't go to the local one.  Like, I got there at two in the afternoon, and I was like, I just put my bags in.  I go, can you watch my bags right in the lobby of the hotel?  And they're like, yeah.  I go, where's the thing?  They sent me to the local one, and it's just like, you know, Dutch chicks with zits.  And so I went in.  It must be like, you know, your local strip club as opposed to like your top-of-the-line 
[02:35:30]  gentlemen's club chicks.  Oh, it's the best, though.  You could, there's this key, you could go to these, the drivers will take you to these  really nice houses where you go in, you pay, you get drinks, and it's all these beautiful  women in evening gowns.  Really?  And you get to pick.  And you just go, you?  You get to pick, you?  Yeah.  It was, at that time, it was a couple hundred gilded.  See, oh, really?  See, the window girls are 50 bucks.  Yeah.  And they look like it, yeah.  Yeah.  Worth every penny.  This is like going to the mall.  What is this?  We went, we went, Patrice got there, though. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, shit.  He literally went in, the first girl he went into, he came out eight minutes later, and  he was just like, I'm like, that's it?  And he's like, I didn't come.  And he just held it because he wanted to fuck, like, he saw five different women that he  wanted to bang on the way there.  So he just went to each one and held his nut, just stuck it in, pumped, and then left.  And they're like, you do not come.  And he's like, I got to go.  The last pitch, it was like a 45-year-old white chick.  He comes out just sweating.  Yes!  And then you see the chick, the lady's head just come up behind the curtain, sweating, 
[02:36:30]  her hair's all frizzed out.  She turns her side backwards, just closed.  She just shut the bitch down for the night.  That is hilarious.  Patrice is a cosmon.  Oh, yeah.  Man, that's, because I went, and I went with a cat.  Red didn't go with me.  He was my role manager, because, you know.  We love Red.  We're mad he's not with you today.  Yeah.  So I go, and I said, fuck it.  I'm going to get two bitches.  Yeah, why not?  If one's good. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  So at the same time, like, I'm. . .  And so it was this French bride, and she goes, you like this French pussy, don't you, nigga?  I'm like, hey, bitch, what is this all about?  She said that.  What is this all about?  I didn't come for that.  Then five minutes later, I go, hey, call me that again.  She followed me around for two days.  Like, we were hanging out for two days, and me and a French hooker, it was the best ever.  I don't understand the fucking black guys over there.  The hookers will fucking go with you for nothing.  White guys, you get. . .  They make you pay every fucking time. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, because it's full. . .  It's Amsterdam full of white dudes.  Yeah.  And you know what was attributed?  That they hate German people, man.  They really. . .  Yeah, they finally hate that.  They still hate them.  Like, they'll walk in.  There's these dudes walked in with German accents.  It was like, you thought a black dude walking to a redneck bar.  I feel bad for you.  They're still holding that garage.  Oh, man.  I actually went to one of the bitches, and she. . .  I walked in, and she's like. . .  I took my pants off.  And she went. . .  Wash your dick.  What?  And I'm like. . . 
[02:38:00]  So, I was just nervous.  So, I went over to this pedestal sink that was higher than me.  I'm just on my tippy toes trying to throw warm water at my balls.  How'd she know your dick was dirty?  And then I go. . .  I haven't fucked anybody.  Yeah.  I go. . .  You've been banging all day.  Why don't you. . .  You should be washing your cunt.  I have to do the washing.  I stink from sweat.  Yeah.  Washing my balls in a pedestal sink on my tippy toes.  Because a hooker don't want. . .  You are not clean.  Damn, Bobby.  That's not really a compliment.  Oh, my God.  This is hilarious. 
[02:38:30]  You smelled like a foot.  That's all.  They're trying to clean all that shit up, though.  Make it, like. . . .  That's what I'm hearing.  Make it tourist family friendly.  Who wants to go to Amsterdam with their family?  Yeah.  That didn't work out for Vegas.  No, that's not one of those things where it's like, you know, families.  Hey, let's go to Amsterdam.  You think Amsterdam.  You think hookers and pot.  But I think they got some, like, really nice museums and nice architecture.  Fuck that.  That's where Vince Vega goes.  I know.  But this is what I was reading up on.  And they're sick of people peeing on, like, you know, really nice churches. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, but in Amsterdam.  You know what happens?  Public toilets in Amsterdam.  And I didn't even know this.  I was at an outside cafe the first day there.  I saw this guy go behind this wall.  It's like a circle wooden thing.  And all of a sudden, I just saw pee coming down.  I'm like, this guy's pissing right in front of the. . .  Out in public.  But that's where you piss.  Really?  You go in.  They don't collect the pee?  No, it goes on the street.  That's it.  It's a circle thing.  You walk in.  That's fucked up.  Take a piss.  You shoot it onto the wall.  And that's it.  And then it just oozes out.  Yeah.  It's the most. . . 
[02:39:30]  And then you go to these sex shows.  And it's like going to a movie theater.  It's the sex shows.  But by the third show, the dude ain't even hard.  It's just, like, kind of just going through the motions.  With a Batman outfit and a limp dick.  It's like, this is not. . . .  Sounds great, yeah.  What is this all about?  In Brazil, the sex show, that's not what happened.  This guy, he had a fucking 12-inch uncircumcised fucking Brazilian anaconda the whole time.  Just kept coming out.  It was just half full.  But just enough to be a billy club. 
[02:40:00]  Just enough to do the damage, yeah.  God.  God damn.  You guys fucking. . .  You know, that's the. . .  Now, I haven't been to Brazil.  Is that culture?  Oh, fuck me.  These guys tell their Brazil stories.  Yeah, those Brazil stories are just insanity.  I've heard nothing but rave reviews about Brazilian shit.  I like Brazilian porn a lot.  Imagine us right now, all in robes and flip-flops with nothing else, on Viagra, with just fucking  tents sticking on it.  Some tents bigger than other tents.  And just right now, this is what. . . 
[02:40:30]  My eye!  You don't even attempt to hide your boner?  No.  No, dude.  It's the funniest thing.  You guys are just sitting around looking at each other's boners.  So, look over at fucking Norton with some hot girl in like a G-string and high heels  dancing in front of it.  Yeah.  And just see his fucking blouse pop up and down.  And then it just sticks up straight.  His big round eyes not blinking.  Every time somebody I know goes to Brazil, they marry a Brazilian woman a little while  later.  Wow, really?  They import them back in.  And then they get home.  They treat you like God. 
[02:41:00]  They treat you.  To you while you're there.  And then they. . .  Yeah, until they figure out about her.  And then you're screwed.  That's really true.  This is the weird thing.  Like, in Amsterdam, you go in.  They like you when you go in.  And then when you get in, they're like, hurry up.  Fuck me quick.  You have 15 minutes to come.  Right, right.  That's it.  When you go to Brazil, dude, if they don't like you, they're not going to talk to you.  I mean, these girls. . .  I had one girl like, look, I'd like to stay with you all week.  But if you don't, I got to go fuck other guys.  I'm sorry.  That's what she said.  That's why it's so amazing.  Bobby, don't try to get yourself in this delusional state that these chicks fucking dug you. 
[02:41:30]  Just stop it right now.  Listen, I'm not saying that they really like you, but they, like, they want to be.  They're pragmatic about it.  Yeah, it's not like. . .  No, I think they're better at faking it.  Because from what I hear, they will give you a girlfriend experience.  Yes.  You're family.  They'll hang with you.  They'll actually make it seem like they fucking love you.  But don't start thinking they really do, motherfucker.  This is the problem.  This is the motherfucker that we're. . .  They don't love you?  You're a fucking. . .  I got to go home.  You're a matrix ruiner.  You are. 
[02:42:00]  It's not real.  I'll unplug everybody from the matrix.  I just gave you the pill.  They don't like you.  Fuck you.  They loved me.  All right.  Yeah, they did.  Stay in your. . .  Thailand's the same way, though.  Fake reality, your fucking battery.  I heard Thailand's the same way.  Thailand's fucking hot.  You've been to Thailand?  Yeah.  Yeah, Thailand?  Yeah.  I hear things about Thailand.  They get out of them in magazines.  Like, give me three of these bitches and throw them.  Really?  They got to be cheap bitches over there in Thailand.  Oh, man.  And it's amazing.  Like, you're like, wow, beautiful woman like you.  You should be in America fucking over some guy.  Damn. 
[02:42:30]  You're like, I'm here fucking you over.  You're having chlamydia now.  Right, right, right, right.  In America, giving happy endings.  Right, right, right, right.  You have to wait for some freighter to pick them up and drop them off.  Pay off their fucking shipping with eight years of slavery.  Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  Ah, fucking Gibson.  I. . .  Fuck, man.  That's right.  Gibson.  It's a guitar.  It's a man.  I miss coming here.  Just hookers.  Yeah.  Stories of chlamydia.  How great is that?  I was going to say, you didn't talk about this on Larry King. 
[02:43:00]  No, no, man.  And it's funny.  It was on Larry King with, I think, Jeffrey Ross talking about the election.  Yeah.  Doing a really good job.  But Larry King's not asking.  So.  No.  It is so surreal being on CNN, man.  Like, it's stuff.  Yeah, that's an odd place.  It really is.  Like, what. . .  How is that approached?  Like, what did they say?  Hey, we need, like, some comedy on this.  We were. . .  We were actually going to. . .  We had two other networks we were going to. . .  And then I get this call from my manager.  And he goes. . .  And so when. . .  What do you think about CNN? 
[02:43:30]  When Spike and Comedy Central. . .  Right.  Was like. . .  Because obviously. . .  That's why I was saying that, though.  That's why I was not Comedy Central again.  We even got to go to Spike and Comedy Central with our crap.  It's like one of those things, though, where it's like CNN seems like. . .  Yeah.  Like they wouldn't. . .  Wouldn't do something like this.  No, and it's very. . .  And it's. . .  You know, it's very. . .  It's very. . .  It doesn't seem like it would work, but I have a good time doing it, man.  It's like. . .  Because stuff happens, like. . .  When O.J. got convicted, everybody's looking at me.  Because it's kind of a pretty good Christmas for everybody. 
[02:44:00]  Like, black people got a black president.  White people got O.J.  So. . . .  Everybody got a little something under the tree.  And he was the only one shocked he went to jail.  Like. . .  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Your honor.  I'm not a thief.  I'm a murderer.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Didn't you see the last trial?  Oh, my goodness.  This isn't how part two goes.  But it is.  The sequel sucks.  Right.  And it's like. . .  And how come everybody had a tape recorder?  Everybody had a tape recorder.  You're not going to rob me.  Are you, Juice? 
[02:44:30]  O.J., put down that gun.  Right.  I'm like. . . .  Man.  Yeah, they know.  When your head is that big, you can't be inconspicuous.  That's all.  Look how you wear. . .  Look how you wear your old helmet from USC.  And like. . .  Like, everybody knows who you are.  All he had to do. . .  All he had to do was stay home and stay out.  Just lay low.  Right.  All O.J.  had to do was lay low.  Right.  He was fucking blonde bitches like he wanted to.  Playing his golf.  He was making pension money that he didn't have to give a dime to.  Was he still fucking blonde bitches?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  They looked just like the one he killed.  Fucking ballsy white chicken. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, really, right?  They're like, he ain't gonna do it again.  She's sleeping like fucking. . .  Like, basic instinct every night.  Waiting for her to fucking pull an ice cream.  You never know, though.  With the way. . .  With the way. . .  Nicole was killed, I think you can't guarantee he wouldn't do it again.  Because that was such a rage, personal fucking. . .  I'm gonna cut your fucking head off, bitch.  Thing that if. . .  If another one would have pissed him off. . .  Probably would have just done it again.  Man, but it's all kind of like. . .  I was reading. . .  This guy. . .  This girl set her boyfriend. . .  Her husband's balls on fire. 
[02:45:30]  Set his genitals on fire.  Allegedly.  Like, either your balls are on fire or they're not.  Right, right.  And it's the same reaction.  Like, men go. . .  That's horrible.  Women go.  What did he do?  Like, there's a crime bad enough.  I will set your balls on fire.  Yeah.  Wow, that's nasty.  Oh, man.  Set them. . .  In the stuff. . .  I get news that some they'll put on and some they won't.  Like, I have a Blackberry with all the news that comes across. 
[02:46:00]  And it's just amazing the stuff that people. . .  It's just amazing.  I take my balls on fire.  Like, having to cut my cock off or my balls on fire.  My balls kind of look like they've been on fire, like, already anyways.  A little golden brown or something.  They're, like, red but brown in spots.  It looks like they were on fire.  It was just that Brazilian massage parlor.  It was like prunes in a punching bag.  That's one thing that, like, if I was in a war and they were torturing me, all they'd  have to do is start approaching my balls. 
[02:46:30]  And I would give away everything.  James Bond?  Everything I knew.  Oh, watch him, James Bond.  Where that guy's swinging the fucking knotted rope.  They got James Bond sitting in a chair with no seat.  So his whole fucking ass and balls are hanging down.  And that motherfucker with a bleeding tear would wind this fucking big rope like he used  to climb in gym class with a big knot.  And then he'd swing it and wham!  Smack him in the balls.  No, but the worst one was the first one where he just tapped it.  Yeah, he just tapped it. 
[02:47:00]  He just swung it.  And he was like, ah!  He just swung it just a little bit.  And he was like, ah!  Dude, everyone.  That made the last one worse.  There is not one guy that doesn't know the feeling of winding that extension cord around  your arm and having that end flip up and just tap you a fucking nut.  Not even a good whack.  Just tapped it and you go, let me put this down because I know in another four seconds  that pain is coming.  It's not instant.  I don't know.  Like, I'm from the West Coast, so we rode a lot of bikes. 
[02:47:30]  Like, y'all probably do here.  But bikes, you ever been riding a bike and slipped off in that hip?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  And women have a dip in their bike.  And you're like, shouldn't we have that?  Yeah, that should be the one.  Yeah, so when you saw a guy riding that bike, you'd be like, hey, faggot.  You're riding a girl's bike, you faggot.  It's like, no.  I'll have my balls if I fucking jam on the brake to hit a curb.  And you didn't know what it was.  You just knew, like, eight years old.  You don't know.  Yeah, you didn't know.  I have a stomachache.  I got to lay down.  I don't want to play anymore of today.  A nut injury is the oddest fucking thing. 
[02:48:00]  It's fucking terrible.  It could be a little tap.  And then you got to sit there and assess it and go, is that going to hurt?  Was that enough to, oh, fuck, yeah.  Yeah, that was enough to hurt.  Then you bend over.  Girls used to think it was funny to kick you in the balls.  Yeah, I knew a girl, this girl, her name was Jerry.  And she would kick guys in the balls and laugh just to see, like, us fucking on the floor in the fetal position.  And she would laugh.  And then she came back from summer vacation once and had giant tits. 
[02:48:30]  And all we would do was smack her fucking tits around.  And then she started going to the principal and shit.  That doesn't have the same size.  No, it doesn't.  But it was, it fucking was great for us.  You know, feeling titty.  You got to kick her in the cunt with a steel tooth bullet to get the same effect.  Just wearing a cup to school.  That bone right there.  Oh, the pubis.  Right with a vagina style.  A chin rest or whatever the fuck you want to call it. 
[02:49:00]  A chin rest.  In certain circumstances, it's the chin rest.  In others, it's the nose rest.  Depends on which, you know, which way you're flopping around there.  Boy, you're an acrobat.  Oh, you got to be.  Got to get your whole face involved.  Your ears, whatever the fuck.  Nose, chin.  And you know, like, a lot of people think brothers don't like.  Like eating pussy.  That's one of the.  But I remember, I felt weird because the first time I did it, I was like, I could get into this shit.  Yeah, yeah, this is good.  You are what you eat. 
[02:49:30]  Well, call me Sarah.  I won't do this till your head cave in.  I was going to stop by Popeye's, but this is much better.  That's a good thing.  Black guys don't do this.  Shit.  Shit.  This ain't no beard.  This is all that's left with my old woman.  Are you crazy?  What are you going to do next?  Look in the wonk ass?  Black people surprise us all the time.  Oh, man.  And so ever since, like, Obama's been president, people, like, ask me. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like, how do I feel?  How would you feel if you finally won?  That's how you feel.  You finally won the big one.  That's how you feel.  You made it to the Super Bowl and you won.  But I was here.  Like, I'm so, like, I was so proud.  Like, I really, the next day I thought, man, America's a different place.  I was so proud.  And not because they voted for the dude I voted, but just because it just seemed like finally they picked the guy who seemed to be the brighter guy.  And so I'm driving, I'm so full, and I'm, like, really, like, emotional, loving my country. 
[02:50:30]  And I go to get a taxi, and it drove right past my house.  And I go, didn't you see the news, motherfucker?  Business as usual.  And then, when I was watching the speech, I was just, like, remember when he was giving his transcendent speech, and then you noticed it was bulletproof glass everywhere?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you're the president of the United States.  They're like, you're standing in the middle of a check-cashing place.  Give me a pack of Newports and a Lotto ticket.  He's, like, in a Chinese restaurant.  Oh, my God.  And everybody was watching that speech, like, with your eyes, like, ah, it's coming. 
[02:51:00]  It's coming.  Oh, my God.  It was hit.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  We all just hated.  Horrible.  And then it's just, like, now everything's so, like, you're in.  I was in, now I'm playing these gigs, and so, you know, I'm doing a lot of small clubs.  And you go to these clubs, and, like, I was in St. Louis, and you go to these places where they, like, they haven't gotten a memo.  Like, Missouri still voted for McCain.  Yeah, yeah.  They're waiting for him to be inaugurated.  We're the home of meth, damn it.  It's crack for crackers here. 
[02:51:30]  We don't give a damn what you say.  Oh, it was, it's been just a hilarious thing.  The Obama Secret Service guys have got to be practicing the slow motion, that diving move.  Oh, my goodness.  It's like, they just must have a crash test dummy that they push in the limo.  Just 50 times.  Get it right, motherfucker.  Get it right.  Your time.  Click.  Nope, not fast enough.  And I'm sure it's a lot of, nobody could, he has to have a lot of stand-ins.  I mean, it's got to be a lot of imposters. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, you would think.  Like, you can't, like, it's just, you can't imagine a vitriol.  Just decoys.  You know what it is?  Us living in major cities, it's a little harder for us to kind of grasp the mentality of middle America.  There is a vibe there of pure hatred of the fact that this guy is president.  And they have been known to pull some shenanigans in the past, though.  You know, I actually felt bad for McCain, because you don't want to be the white dude that loses the presidency to a black dude. 
[02:52:30]  That's got to be fucked up at the country club.  Everything was great till you, John.  Great stuff for everybody.  I knew we should have picked somebody else.  We're going to take your nameplate off your locker.  You're not welcome here at Bushwood, sir.  Oh, my goodness.  It's just, it's just, it's just a surreal.  And now it's just like, they're throwing around words like responsibility.  Yeah.  Education, which is kind of fucked up.  Yeah.  You know what?  There was this huge emotional outpouring on Election Day. 
[02:53:00]  They showed a lot of black people just crying their eyes out.  Right.  And it's definitely seemed to calm down a little bit.  Should white people crying their eyes out, too.  White people were crying, too.  Believe me.  Anthony was, I was in tears.  I was in Harlem, and it was the best.  It was like, I have never seen anything.  And I was crying, too.  But not, you know, because it was just like, I had never, I never believed it would happen. 
[02:53:30]  Never.  I never, ever.  Well, that's the same reason I was crying.  And also my taxes.  Did you never believe, did you never believe, but let me tell you, you got to be a fucked  up president when the whole country goes, we're going to try the black dude next.  I mean, that's.  I thought, I thought there'd have to be a frigging wop in there first.  No.  Like a transition with a wop or a Jew or something.  I really don't.  They warm up to it.  Yeah, yeah.  Warm up to it.  Slowly.  A fag.  Something.  Just something.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  Hello.  You know.  Put my hand on the Bible.  I do.  Of course.  I accept this responsibility.  But they go right back.  Engage from Massachusetts.  Because I was thinking, if you took, like, right after 9-11 and said, in 2008, we are  going to elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama, we'd be like, get the fuck out of  here.  Oh, man.  You're right.  And it took eight years, eight short years of George Bush to fuck shit up so bad.  And now he looks like that kid at recess who's ready, looking at the bell for, like, you 
[02:54:30]  can go to fucking recess.  Oh, he wants out.  Yeah, he's chomping at the bit.  That's like what I used to do with the time clock.  I'd sit there.  I used to have a job where I had to punch out, you know.  At 3 o'clock, I had to punch out.  And if you punched out at 1 minute to 3, they'd dock you 15 fucking minutes.  It was on the quarter.  I had that, yeah, yeah.  Dude, at, like, two minutes, I'd be like, fuck this, Clint, I gotta get out of here.  Like, that's what George Bush was like.  He just wants the fuck out. 
[02:55:00]  He really, and it's so, like, we, you can't really, when you look at what's going on in  the world, I don't, I don't know, of course, the president isn't responsible for the economy.  Of course, he isn't.  But it's just, like, kind of a, kind of kismet that everything he touches has been fucked up.  Oh, yeah.  Got to shit.  But it's so ironic to me.  Like, people are getting mad at Blagojevich.  Like, they're getting mad at him.  Like, Illinois has had four governors.  Yep.  And two in a row.  Like, four governors in the last 40 years.  And three have been, that have been indicted. 
[02:55:30]  And three have been convicted.  You know, they're so corrupt, they think it would change their name to Louisiana.  That's how fucked up they are.  And you can't really blame the governor.  If you, you gotta blame the people of Illinois.  How fucked up are you that you don't understand?  Right.  You don't know how to pick, you ain't picked a good governor since Lincoln.  I mean, I'm serious.  How, you can't keep going and corrupt.  How do you keep it electing in criminals?  Two in a row.  Right.  Yeah.  You're right.  Two in a row.  And who doesn't sell influence?  Man, if I gotta fucking Senate seat, I'm not gonna just give it to you. 
[02:56:00]  What do I get?  That's what politics is based on, so I don't understand why people get angry.  I was trying to see if this was common practice, or if this was like, this guy was being a little  too ballsy about it, like the fucking guy that used to sell the sports memorabilia.  We got a Senate seat up here.  It's a genuine Senate seat in pristine mint tin condition, people.  Buy it on FlexPay.  And we're gonna give you a Sosa and McGuire rookie card. 
[02:56:30]  Like, this guy was being a little too out there with it.  Tapes of him saying, yeah, buy the fucking seat.  This wife is fucking cursing and shit.  But ain't that, like, you gotta go, I mean, they done had Raskin.  Kowski done had Ford.  I mean, it's just that that's the way it's done.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the way shit happens.  I guess that's business as usual, but cover the shit up a little bit.  You can't be mad.  Jesus Christ.  I can't get into believing that this, how do you pick that many motherfuckers wrong?  It's wrong.  Yeah.  All the time. 
[02:57:00]  And they keep doing it.  All the time.  Like, two in a row.  You can't ever underestimate the stupidity of the American people.  I mean, the whole thing with, in D.C. when they elected fucking, what's his name?  Marion Barry.  Marion Barry.  Sure.  I mean, the motherfucker, there he is.  Yeah, but four white governors Trump's Marion Barry, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Four governors.  I'll give it a four governors.  And a crackhead mayor.  I have to check that on this.  It's like poker hands.  Which one wins?  Is that a flush against the full house? 
[02:57:30]  What have we got there?  Oh, and Kwame Kilpatrick.  We get corrupt.  Yeah, yeah.  We get corrupt mayors.  Inept mayors.  You guys.  You motherfuckers.  You see how they're trying to drag Jesse Jr. in that whole thing, though?  And they're like, cool, candidate number five.  And you know what's so fucked up?  That's just the, he was paying the price.  Like, if you want to be a senator, this is the, right, right.  It's like being, like, if you open a business in some places, you're going to pay whatever  element is around.  So he was doing.  It certainly doesn't seem the way it should be. 
[02:58:00]  No, but that's how shit goes.  Like, just like anybody who works with a president or doing somebody's campaign, they do it because  they expect something in return.  Yeah.  When donors give to somebody, they expect something in return.  So why is this, it's always been quid, quid, quid, quid.  So why is all of a sudden, it's a big deal.  You know if somebody's a spokesperson for somebody doing a campaign, they're going to  be their chief of staff.  Right, right.  Or the other one that's going to be their.  Or they're going to have some high level candidate.  White House spokesman or something.  So.  This jackass got caught on tape, though.  Yeah, but. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, he didn't think he was doing anything wrong.  I, well, fuck him.  I don't care.  Let me, let me.  Let me preface this by saying, fuck him.  Right.  I don't give a shit what happens to him.  I'm just saying, it's obviously, why is this, all these gradations?  He was doing what they call, let's shit the Chicago way.  That's how it happened.  So I don't understand why all of a sudden.  Who taped him?  Who taped him?  Everybody.  Everybody.  Yeah, apparently everybody.  Because they let OJ and want to take this.  People just walk in, like speaking to my lapel.  Oh, man.  And he said, we're probably being taped. 
[02:59:00]  He said it.  Yeah.  He goes, fuck this.  And he goes, if I ain't selling it, I'm taking it.  Period.  He's, I'll take the seat.  Really?  But who doesn't do that?  Well, Dick Cheney, we looking for a vice president?  Fuck, I couldn't find nobody.  Hire me.  Yeah.  I mean, it's what happens.  Yeah, yeah.  It's what happens.  It's just, you know something?  What happens and the way things happen, that seems to be what the dividing line is.  You know, if it's business as usual.  Like, politics, it's all fucking corruption and nepotism and all that bullshit.  But then, if you do it with a little too much gusto and you're out, a little too much outside the lines of your good old boy friends, then you're going to get fucked. 
[02:59:30]  It's like anything else.  And I think this guy was a little too verbose in his head.  I must be so fucked up.  For sale, for sale, a seat in the Senate here.  I must be so fucked up because I literally, literally listened to that tape and can't figure out what the fuck he did wrong.  Like, that's how fucked up I am.  I went, oh, okay.  Oh, shit, yeah, yeah. 
[03:00:00]  You don't think I'm going to hook my boy up if I got, you know, you don't think, if I have something that's that valuable, you think that I'm not going to at least peddle it for something?  Wouldn't you, I mean, who does that?  I think if you, I think you go about it by appointing somebody that you will then get something from later.  Not, give me some fucking money.  Like, hey, now you owe me, motherfucker.  It's on eBay now.  So, when this happens, you know, remember me.  And his wife is going to get, like, $150,000 for nothing every year. 
[03:00:30]  Like, everybody who signed, like, every politician who gets.  Yeah, but you can't say it or get caught saying it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened.  But see, that's my thing.  It happens, but you got caught.  It's like cheating on your wife.  You can cheat on it.  Just don't let her find out.  Don't get caught.  So, that Amsterdam story I told was just a joke.  Of course it was.  You all know that.  To me, I just want the veneer of the bullshit gone.  Like, stop pretending like we're not.  We are a huge, like, you know who I respect?  I respect China.  They don't give a fuck what you think. 
[03:01:00]  Fuck you.  Man, huh?  Like, remember that little nine-year-old girl who sang the National Anthem?  And she was too ugly for the world to see.  And the Chinese government went, fuck you.  You will go back to the sweatshops.  You will never sing for the world to see.  They don't give a fuck what you think.  You're too fucking ugly.  They made the little girl sing behind the curtain.  The ugly one was singing the other one.  That's how I go.  The pretty girl went out front and lip-synced.  Yes.  Did you see how nervous the Chinese Olympians look?  Because if they lose, they die.  That's pretty much it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We will, we will, you'll be hiding to an anchor with this bronze medal around your goddamn 
[03:01:30]  neck.  And they've been fucking getting away with sending us lead fucking pacifiers.  You know why?  And we just go, ah, all right.  The workers are fucking five years old.  You think a five-year-old gives a fuck what?  Lead.  Extra lead for you, goddamn hell.  I don't give a fuck.  Lead, their human rights violations are abominable.  Oh.  We talk about certain countries and be like, we won't do business with them because of  the way they treat their people.  China is insane with the way they treat their people.  They put extra lead, but I can't get an extra pack of soy sauce to save my fucking life. 
[03:02:00]  Obviously, there ain't no lead in this shit right here.  Wouldn't you just love once to have enough duck sauce for a whole egg roll?  Like, just fucking, you know I'm going to want my last bite of egg roll to have as much  fucking duck sauce as my first bite.  And your returned customer.  Yeah.  Go there over and over and over again.  One packet.  How about you throw me a bone finally?  And then stir it, motherfucker.  Isn't it a key to life?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  Yeah, what is that shit? 
[03:02:30]  Oh, it's horrible.  Can people get colored gold, but it isn't gold, you motherfucker.  Give it to me.  It's like, and people get worked up, like, I'll never forget.  Remember Tropic Thunder?  And the people got so upset that they used the word retard.  Right.  And they would organize a rally and want to, if you can understand the word retard and  organize a rally, motherfucker, he ain't talking to you.  It's not you.  But if you show up at the rally with a juice box and Spider-Man pajama pants on, you're  fucking retarded.  You, with a cup, fuck you.  Now sit down and put your helmet on. 
[03:03:00]  We're going to let D.L. Hughley breathe.  He's killing.  D.L. Hughley breaks the news on CNN Saturday and Sunday nights at 10 o'clock.  Bob Kelly's in studio today as well.  We'll continue and, yeah, we'll do another segment for everybody next.  Stay there.  We're back hanging with D.L. Hughley.  D.L. Hughley breaks the news on CNN Saturday and Sunday nights at 10 p.m.  And, Bobby, you were, like, cracking up the live audience during the break.  What was that about?  It had nothing to do with me.  We're all laughing together.  Where, David, when you tap him or hit him on the shoulder, like, you know, hey, get 
[03:03:30]  me whatever.  Yeah.  He has a twitch.  He has a twitch.  Where if something happened with his mouth, it just twitches every time you hit him.  And it's, like, his lip goes down or it goes up.  Really?  Something happens with his face.  Like, it's not, the skin on his head isn't connected to his skull.  Oh, here's David.  Hi, young David.  And it's the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Say hi to D.L. Hughley.  Very funny man.  You all right?  Nice to meet you, sir.  Nice to meet you, too, sir.  Do you know who he is? 
[03:04:00]  I certainly do know who he is, yes.  Yeah, what do you know about him?  It's almost an Elvis snarl.  Yeah, watch this, David.  Stay there.  Look at Opie.  Look at Opie.  Look over there.  Watch.  Wait.  Oh.  He's trying right now.  So you're going to beat the shit out of him until he twitches?  Oh, yeah, he did do a little.  He does this little thing with his mouth.  Look at Danny.  Oh, no.  Okay, I just saw that one.  Like a dog.  He goes, uh-huh.  God damn it.  Hey, man, you tell me.  When you get too close to a dog, they show the team. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You leave him with me.  I'm taking you out of this bullshit.  I take you out of this.  Sweet.  All right.  Sweet?  Sweet.  Wow.  You got a question for D.L.?  Sure.  How do you like being on CNN?  I like it a lot.  He hates it.  I like it a lot.  What do you think?  Now, what do you want to do?  I'm trying to get into radio broadcasting.  The good way is not to let people beat the shit out of you.  It's like going to prison.  You can't let somebody fuck you in one respect, so you got to do it. 
[03:05:00]  Now you got to beat up Bobby.  Now you got to beat up Bobby.  So why don't you go beat up Bobby?  He's fucking around, because you look like you'll do it.  He said to kill him.  He's like, all right.  Bobby will fucking rip his head off.  He's like a nice guy.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Jerusalem.  He's Jewish.  He could not be more Jewish.  I'm from Jerusalem, man.  He's Jewish, but he doesn't know much about being a Jew.  He gets it wrong every time.  No.  Well, some people say he gets it wrong, but a lot of people say he gets it wrong.  Somebody was bitching that the thing you said about the Festival of Lights wasn't true. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Like that.  It's true.  The Greeks.  The Greeks, the Romans.  Well, is it the Greeks or the Romans?  The Romans.  There's a difference there.  It was the Romans?  What is it?  It's the Romans.  Yeah?  And what did they do?  They kind of...  They destroyed the holy temple of the Jews.  Yeah.  And there was one bottle of oil on there, and the Jews thought that it wasn't going to  last enough to light up the whole...  The oil story.  Only for one night, and it lasted for eight days.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah.  That's it.  The same thing, yeah.  So where's the suffering part coming?  Because there's got to be some suffering. 
[03:06:00]  There's no suffering.  There's no suffering.  The suffering was that the temple was destroyed.  And all their homes and stuff was all destroyed.  The Romans destroyed all the homes and everyone, the property and their land and everything.  Better gifts first day or last day of Hanukkah?  Last day.  It has to be.  They saved the best for last.  No.  My house is only gifts on one day.  What?  I don't get gifts every day.  He does do that.  I don't get gifts every day, no.  But aren't you supposed to get eight days of gifts?  No, that's a myth.  What?  I don't get gifts.  I think that's Kwanzaa.  Is that Kwanzaa?  I don't get gifts every day.  I'm all confused. 
[03:06:30]  I think that's Kwanzaa.  I don't get gifts every day.  I thought that the Jews gave a gift every day of Hanukkah.  That's something I know from when I...  No, you have to light the candle every day.  Yeah, but then there's a little gift that's given.  No, you're supposed to get a gift every day.  Oh, really?  No, there's only one day when there's like a real gift, and then other days are like  little like Dreadles or Hanukkah Gelt, a little, like you said before, a little like...  Crap.  How many Dreadles do you have?  Too many to count.  Really?  Do you ever play Dreadle?  When I was a lot younger in school, I used to play Dreadle, and then like the winners...  How do you play Dreadle? 
[03:07:00]  Is it like Yahtzee?  No, it's like a little thing, and you spend...  Dreadle, Dreadle, Dreadle.  I made it out of play.  Even I know that song.  Yeah, I know.  And until I was 25, what the fuck is a Dreadle?  Yeah, Dreadle.  It's like shooting dice.  Exactly.  There's like a Dreadle, and there's three letters on, and one of them is me, and there's  a pot of like the Hanukkah Gelt that we talked about before, and if it lands on one letter,  you get everything in the pot.  If it lands on a number of that letter, you get nothing in the pot.  Sounds Jewish to me.  If it lands on a different letter, you get like some of the Gelt in the pot. 
[03:07:30]  You get everything.  Yeah.  And if it lands on a certain letter, you run the media.  What did you say, man?  I said something horribly stereotypical.  Oh, my God.  What the...  So...  This is horrible, man.  Hey, man.  See how it's going on record.  He's got to go on record.  I'm standing up for you, man.  Listen to me.  Some people have to suck cock and jam.  Oh, shit.  That really happens.  You're the chicken...  You're the rooster or the heen. 
[03:08:00]  That's kind of how it goes.  Yeah.  What do you...  Are you going to be the hen or the rooster?  What do you think?  Hey, man, you could at least have to do with the red fruit.  Yeah, you could smack the shit out of Sam.  You could take Sam, but he's my bitch, so you got to go through.  I mean, you could take...  Yeah, it's going to cost you some cigarettes.  DL, you want to see something creepy?  Go ahead, Sam.  Go over to Bobby.  Let Bobby work you over a little bit.  Get over...  Wait.  Stop.  Sit.  Stay.  Over here.  Come here.  Come here.

You can own a black guy again.  Oh, my God.  The black and white guy.  Look at that afro.  You think he's white?  Yeah, I was like, man.  There's something in there.  Something.  Somebody was with somebody.  My hair is like that.  I went into CNN. 
[03:09:00]  I said, you got something for my hair?  We got electricity and tape.  And that's all we got in my way.  Sam's related to Thomas Jefferson.  All right.  Get up.  For real.  Are you really?  For real.  Look at you.  Thomas Jefferson.  And I think he's related because of one of the Tom's trips out back one night.  Which he was known to do.  Hey, man.  So this is what you got to do to get in the radio, huh?  This is the story.  That's what you got to do.  Why don't you tell Sam to stop?  Yeah.  Stand up for yourself.  Yeah.  You don't have to take that shit from Sam. 
[03:09:30]  That's for sure.  You don't have to take it from Sam.  Bobby, you do.  Yeah.  What are you going to do, Dave?  If some shit you got to stop.  Yeah.  You got to stop.  Grab him by the hair.  You can't suck everybody's cock in jail.  Bobby's the guy.  Some people have to suck your cock.  Bobby's the guy like benching the entire fucking stack of weights.  And Sam is just some fucking bitch.  No.  Sam's the guy that gets you whatever you need in jail.  Right.  And let's see if you can get this done, though.  Intern David, tell Sam to stop and let's see what happens here.  Tell him.  Tell him you don't like that shit. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Tell him.  Let's go.  You don't want him hitting you.  Okay.  Sam, could you please stop tapping me on the shoulder?  Yeah, but say it like you mean it, dude.

Now, intern David, freestyle a little bit.  Take what DL gave you, and let's see what you got to do.  Embellish it.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Add your own spices.  Sam, why don't you hit him first?  Yeah, give him a little.  Hey, Sam, what are you doing to me?  I don't want to see this from you anymore, Sam.  What?  That's a far cry from you.  Motherfucker unass me.  How did you devolve so quickly? 
[03:12:00]  How did you devolve so quickly?  Hey, you turned into a fucking medical manager.  Dave is Adam Sandler and Airheads trying to be mean.  Whoever saw Airheads is going to like that.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Well, you know what?  You don't get one of those very often.  It's not in you, man.  It's not in you.  I think it is, D.O.  You brought it out of him.  We just got to get it to where it's on the surface.  He's not serious that he's like this for now, right?  No, he is.  That's the beauty of him.  Are you serious?  Sam, give him a good one.  What do you think?  We hired an actor to be a Jew?  All right. 
[03:12:30]  Hi, how are you?  Central casting.  No, we need more.  My name is David.  I look miserable.  All right.  Give him a good one.  Give him a good one.  How old are you, man?  26.

Or what?  Or what?  This is getting worse.  Yeah, or what?  Or what?  Or what?  Get mad, David.  Come on, David.  There'll be a lot of shit coming your way, Sam. 
[03:13:00]  You better watch yourself.  Oh, damn.  A lot of shit coming your way.  David, you forgot rule number one.  He used the word motherfucker.  Get back to motherfucker.  Always use motherfucker.  That's where you lost this.  Hey, you motherfucker.  You better watch it.  See?  Yeah, but you can't throw you better watch it and motherfucker.  No, you got to like.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to just.  Because he's just going to say it or watch.  Don't ever finish a word.  Right.  Just don't finish any more of your word.  Not even motherfucker.  Just don't finish a word.  And look at him in the eye.  If you.  This is. 
[03:13:30]  This is not going to work.  Okay.  Try it again.  Go.  Motherfucker.  What are you doing?  Pushing you.  See, I told you not to be.  Pushing you.  Don't ask a question.  Yeah, you're asking him questions that he has answers for.  This is what is going to happen.  When I.  I'm going to read about David snapping and killing all you motherfuckers.  You're going to have a good laugh, though.  And I am going to go, wow.  I knew it.  Because dude's like, he's snapping.  And he's laughing now.  It's funny.  I'm just going to see a YouTube video of Danny with fucking two AKs. 
[03:14:00]  I'm going to let it fall, my motherfucker.  And then I got to testify.  I kind of thought it would happen.  I knew it.  I was in there that day.  They were pushing him around.  David, try it.  One more time, David.  The motherfucker, maybe he's got to be angry like a white guy.  Yeah, something.  Maybe something you could do.  Dude, I will fucking rip your head off and shit down your fucking throat.  Yeah, let's see how it says.  Try that.  Let's go.  Do I got to say that?  Watch.  Well, just something like that.  Yeah, just make sure you make it up yourself. 
[03:14:30]  Rage.  White guys use rage.  Motherfucker.  That's it.  Go.  You don't smile after you say motherfucker.  Well, I think the problem is, you can't have a windbreaker and glasses on.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you've never seen nobody win a fight with a windbreaker on.  No, take off the crossing guard jacket.  All right.  There you go.  Take off.  You need the glasses.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  You actually don't need the glasses.  I do.  To see?  Can I ask intern David's how I'm like, everyone has a fake karate move they go into to maybe. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, intimidate.  Yeah, physical intimidation.  It would be you're like, look, you know, I'm going to do this to show that I might have  some skills.  Fighting skills.  What's your move?  There you go.  There you go.  Backwards hat.  A little better.  Backwards hat going on.  A little better.  All right.  Sam, push him.  No, no, no.  Don't put, you don't want to put your hat backwards and bangs in the front.  You're never scared of a dude with bangs.  Like that.  You can't have that.  There you go. 
[03:15:30]  There you go.  There you go.  We're going to toughen you up.  Yeah.  All right.  What's your karate kind of like, you know, your stance where you-  Get into like a fighting stance and threaten him verbally.  All right.  Sam, go ahead.  Motherfucker, what's you doing, man?

I'm going to hire a bodyguard for you.  Oh, my God.  Because you know what? 
[03:16:00]  You are an innocent soul, and fuck these people, man.  I'm going to put a shit on you.  Put your windbreaker on.  Do you have a $6 million man lunchbox?  I'm going to tell you, man.  I don't condone any of this bullshit.  You understand what I'm saying?  Put your fucking windbreaker on.  You're coming with me.  We're going to get some black-eyed peas and shit.  Come on.  You're coming with me, because you can't be out in the yard by yourself.  No.  No.  You're going to be kind of like my bitch, but I won't actually fuck you.  You just come on.  Just put your jacket on.  You're coming with me. 
[03:16:30]  Sam, are you scared?  Give him his windbreaker.  I was a little scared that he was going to shit on me.  Listen, David.  Who wants to be shit on?  David.  That would be gross.  You're going to be D.L.'s bitch, but you're going to have to do his taxes for him.  Yeah.  But that's how you're going to get out of prison, too.  Damn, man.  Oh, my God.  Motherfucker.  I'm going to shit on you.  Honestly, let me ask you something.  You never had a fight ever in your life?  Ever?  No.  Never?  Have you ever got laid ever?  No.  They're almost the same thing.  Yeah.  Almost the same thing. 
[03:17:00]  Jesus.  They're almost the same thing.  That's great.  You're going to see him in the news.  He beat up a pussy.  He started flailing, spitting on him.  I forgot what I was.  We don't know who he was, but he had a yellow windbreaker on.  He kept going, I'll shit on you, you motherfucker.  Where do you get a yellow windbreaker?  I bought it.  American Eagle.  Oh.  But I've been to American Eagle.  They must have it.  They have this, yeah.  In the back?  They're hiding in the back.  Yeah.  It's there a couple years ago.  I was saving this for David, but you can have it. 
[03:17:30]  From the David collection.  My dad doesn't want me to get hit by a car at night.  I know.  It's just like a school bus.  Come on, because now I'm fucking, I'm in it now.  Yes.  I don't even want to be in it.  Oh, he's pushing him again.  Give me your jacket.  David, go to Rage.  It's a nice jacket.  One more.  Go to Rage.  It's a nice jacket.  Go to Rage.  I think you're going to have this jacket, motherfucker.  There you go.  Yeah, I do.  Try to take the jacket, Sam.  Sam, take his jacket.  Take his jacket.  Coming after me, man.  You ain't never going to have this jacket.  That's it, David.  You ain't never going to have this jacket. 
[03:18:00]  That's it.  There you go.  That's my jacket.  Go to Rage.  I can't fucking beat the shit out of you, man, if you keep touching me.  Really?  That's it.  That's it.  Really?  Rage.  I reiterate, you can't say anything.  You can't emphasize, really?  You can't do that.  Why do y'all do this to this man?  I don't know.  We've got to toughen him up, Dio.  We do have to toughen him up a little bit.  So how long have you been working here?  It's 11 o'clock.  How long have you been working here?  Since September.  How's it been going for you?  It's going pretty well.  Really?  Yeah, I'm enjoying it. 
[03:18:30]  I'm learning a lot of stuff about radio.  Really?  What is the biggest lesson you've learned about radio?  Watch this.  Biggest lessons I've learned?  Right.  This motherfucker.  I'm taking your glasses.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's taking your glasses.  Isn't this like...  How are you taking my glasses, motherfucker?  I want these glasses.  What are you going to do with these glasses, motherfucker?  These are my glasses.  You don't ever touch them on a man's glasses.  That's good.  Yeah.  But I like the little rock'em, sock'em, Roebuck punch he's throwing.  This shit should have ended in the third grade. 
[03:19:00]  Really?  Like, for everybody.  This is the same shit I used to sit and see in, like, the third grade.  Dave, it wouldn't be bad to push him back.  He's pushed it a thousand times.  Maybe a little pushback.  At a certain point.  At a certain point, you've got to mean business.  Not a girly push.  I got your back, David.  Yeah, let's go.  Don't worry.  We got you.  We got you.  Let me hold these glasses.  We got you.  You know, fucker, you don't touch my glasses.  I got you.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  A little push.  Another push.  Well, you can't ask for, don't lean in like you're going to push and don't. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't fake push a motherfucker.  Once you commit.  You got to go in.  David, bite him.  Use those big chompers.  You want to bite me?  And bite him to salmon.  You want to bite me?  Bite him.  Bite me.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bite me then.  They're happy for you that you're fighting back a little bit.  See, you know, there's no guarantee you're going to win.  People say shit like Noble that you got to stand up a little bit.  You're probably going to get your ass whooped a couple of times. 
[03:20:00]  Right.  That's all I got.  Not even a light.  It's not even a tunnel.  It's just you're always going to get your ass kicked.  Right, right, right.  But you'll have your yellow jacket.  What if David just snapped and knocked Sam out?  Oh, he's going to.  I would love to see it.  UFC style out of nowhere.  I would love to see a spinning back fist.  I'm over there crying over Sam's body.  Fucking straighten that afro right out.  Dave, what's your karate pose? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what, Dave?  Watch this.  Sam, put your hand up like a glove.  And Dave, throw a punch.  And let's see what kind of punch.  How hard your punch is.  Throw a one-two.  A one-two.  You ever see boxers do that?  A one-two, Dave.  When they're sparring?  Yes, I've seen.  When they're training?  Let's see what you got.  So train on his hands.  Just watch my pumps.  Don't worry about it.  Put your hands up first.  You don't bring them from your side.  Let's see how you fight.  Sick shooters.  Since we can't see how you fuck.  What the fuck?  He's Little Joe from Bonanza.  Go! 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  All right, guys, ready?  One-two.  One-two.  Go.  Eye of the tiger.  Come on.  Oh, that's pretty good.  That was good.  That's pretty good.  All right.  He's got a good right.  That's pretty good.  That's good.  Jab, jab with your left.  Jab with your left.  Jab with your left.  Jab with your left.  Jab and again.  Jab, jab, jab.  Now, David, miss accidentally and knock the fuck out of him.  I know what you're talking about.  He didn't go, oops.  David's got a good right hand there.  He does, man.  All right.  There was absolutely no defense, so you would have been on the floor in a second. 
[03:21:30]  Once you slide one of your punches, your face is wide open.  If your opponent's face is made of paper, I can get a shot.  You just oppose the violence.  I'm blind, too, by the way.  You just don't like violence at all.  I can see that right coming from him.  Oh, I know.  Okay.  I understand that.  Jesus.  Especially with the yellow jacket.  Right.  Yeah.  You know what?  People don't...  You're a gentle soul, and that's what it is.  Yeah, yeah, that's good.  People don't appreciate that.  He's a gentile soul.  That's all it is, man.  So just stay inside a lot. 
[03:22:00]  Like, we're going to get you an office somewhere where you're safe.  He's been able to go, you know, how many years, 20, whatever you are, that many years without  getting into a fight, so, you know.  Yeah, but that's because he won't fight, not because nobody tried to fight.  People have tried to fuck with you, and you just kind of walk away, turn the other cheek,  as they say.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  That's the story.  What do you say?  Please don't beat me up?  That's the story.  You say, please don't beat me up?  I don't say that.  What do you say?  I don't really say anything, man.  I just kind of walk away.  This is what he does.  He rolls up into that yellow jacket, like one of those fucking armadillos. 
[03:22:30]  Like one of those bugs?  Yeah.  That's just kind of, yeah.  You know that, that's like, I used to see shit like that all the time.  Oh, hell yeah.  In school, always.  And then at a certain point, you know that, like even at a certain point, humanity takes  up and you go, man, stop with the bullshit.  Like, they get, you know that you are like against violence when people get exhausted from  fucking with you.  Yeah.  I used to get fucked with all the time until I broke my arm, I got a cast on it, and the 
[03:23:00]  kid who used to fuck with me all the time, he got me in a hallway, but I had  the cast, so I just used the cast and bashed his fucking head in.  That's what you fucking do.  Nice.  And then he kicked your ass.  No, he cried like a little baby.  I'd love to hear one of these stories where the little guy takes the bully, finally knocks  him the fuck out, and the next day the bully comes in and beats the living shit out of  the fucking little guy.  I got a story for you.  I got a story for you.  His dude named Kevin Ferguson, he used to fuck with me all the time, right? 
[03:23:30]  And so, one time he was taking his jacket off.  Well, you know, we were going to fight, and I had had enough.  I used to be you.  I didn't have a jacket, and I had an afro.  And I didn't know what the fucking dreidel was.  But other than that, we're almost the same.  And a personality.  Right, right, right.  So, he took his jacket off, and I realized that I could, ah, man, I fucked him up with  that jacket on, and man, he had his jacket around, and he was like, wait till I take  my jacket off, fuck you, and I'm hitting him.  And the next day, boy, that motherfucker didn't have that jacket, and he beat the shit 
[03:24:00]  out of me.  Beat the shit out of him.  Beat the fuck out of me.  That's what happened.  That's what happened.  But we never fought anymore after that.  It isn't like the movies all the time, where you beat up the big guy, and they're like,  yeah, it's like, that motherfucker got lucky.  He sucker punched me.  I got one more in me.  Yeah.  I tried to bully a guy once.  I tried my hand.  I tried my hand at bullying one day.  Yeah.  This kid.  I'm friends with him now to this day, but I, ah, ah.  Jim Norton?  No.  You wouldn't have to.  He'd just fucking coax you under a porch.  Don't beat me up. 
[03:24:30]  Just come here for a second.  Let me show you something.  Suck my dick.  I went up to the kid.  I was like, fuck you.  What the fuck are you looking at?  And he was all scared.  But then his big friend, Bobby Cicchetti, came up behind him.  I was bitching this kid out, and everybody was surrounding us.  And then he came over and bitched me out in front of, like, just me first.  Oh, you look like a dick.  He's like, look.  It was like watching the little fish get eaten by the big one, and then the big one.  Because he was like Matt Dillon.  This kid looked just like Matt Dillon.  And I've always been afraid of Matt Dillon since that movie.  So it's like my bodyguard. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, it was just bad.  It's like my bodyguard.  I was just scared of him.  He walked up.  He goes, what are you going to do, huh?  And I was like, nothing.  And he was like, beat it, you fag.  It's Moody's bike now.  Oh, I was fucking.  I have Moody's bike now.  Exactly.  Oh.  Yeah, humorous.  That's bad.  So you grew up in New Jersey where?  Jersey.  I know, but it's Jersey.  I mean.  Right here, North Jersey.  Okay.  Is this North Jersey?  Well, you taught him to be fucking talkity like this.  Man, I'm the one on your side.  The mean streets in North Jersey. 
[03:25:30]  Definitely, man.  North Jersey.  Out of all these people in this fucking room, I got your back.  And this is how you do?  North Jersey.  North Jersey.  Yes.  What is that?  Man.  Just keeps hitting him.  What is that thing with his mouth that makes me fucking laugh?  It is an odd little twitch.  Have you always had that?  Pretty much.  You have sisters?  Younger.  Yeah.  Do you protect them?  Definitely.  Hot?  Like.  Got pictures?  I don't have any pictures with me.  No.  Why not?  Do you live at home?  Damn it.  I do.  I live at home.  I don't got no money.  I'm living at home.  What's your bedroom?  Do you have any posters on the wall? 
[03:26:00]  Like the last Sue and A?  Sue and A?  Have you ever had sex at all?  Ever?  Never.  Never?  Never.  Do you want to?  Do you think it'd be true?  At some point, definitely.  At some point?  Definitely.  Wow.  When ASAP?  Right?  If I hired you a hooker, would you do something with her?  Is that a, yeah.  You got to, I don't know if you're falling over or having a.  David, look.  I'm not trying to be fucked up.  Hey, David, you don't have to pay for anything.  He's going to pay for everything.  I promise you.  I'll pay for a hooker.  It'll be a nice looking hooker. 
[03:26:30]  I mean, you, okay.  You won't know she's a hooker.  There you go.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's high.  What do you think, man?  That's high grade.  What do you think?  I might have to think about it.  Yeah, definitely.  Might have to think about it.  Yeah, make sure you tell him, like, it's a hook, like, this is a hooker, because he might  think he's doing good for the first time in this life.  Oh, falling low.  No, but I don't, like, I just want you to, you need a, you know what it is?  You don't even need a home run.  You need a fucking base hit.  You need, you just need to do something to make you feel better.  Feel it during the game.  Yeah, you just need a chick to blow on your cock.  Right.

Is that your boyfriend, the fucking UFC bald guy?  Yeah.  Maybe we should, let's pick him.  You know he's not even jealous because he ain't even getting out.  Wait a second.  Listen, maybe we should get there.  He's real concerned.  He's not even concerned at all.  Look at, he got a windbreaker, old man.  This will get you.  Look at him.

At least that voice is sexy.  Right.  Holy shit.  Now, David, you're halfway there, right?  All right, now, I want you to sandwich him in a great big hug.  Give David a great big hug.

[03:28:30]  Give him a little steak.  What happened?  David.  Leah.  Are you scared?  He's not moving up.  What can I tell you?  Leah, give him up.  Relax.  Leah.  David, turn to Leah.  He's turned the wrong way.  David, turn to Leah.  I'm trying to be in the middle.  I'm trying to be in the middle.  Hey, man.  Just turn.  At some point, somebody's going to dig it a little more.  So you got to go with that.  Turn.  Turn.  There you go.  Squeeze him from the back.  Oh my goodness.  Squeeze him from the back.  Get him from the back.  No, hold the hug.  Hold the hug.  You like that?  Now you get into it.  Slide it.  Now mush your tits into his face.  There you go.  Now I was talking to David.  David.  So David.  Big guy. 
[03:29:00]  I was talking to David.  We're good.  Oh, what happened?  Did you start feeling something?  David, how you feel, David?  It was okay.  It was okay?  What was wrong with it?  Yeah, it was okay.  What was wrong with it?  Nothing.  Nothing was wrong with it.  Did you like it?  Yeah, it was nice.  Yeah.  Did you have a ball?  Okay.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  You're not going to pass out?  No, I'm not going to pass out, no.  Okay.  But it was very pleasant.  She's a beautiful blonde woman.  You have another beautiful brunette.  Yes, definitely.  I'm old enough to be his mother.  Right.  Okay.  And you can even call her that, mommy.  That's always great. 
[03:29:30]  Why have I bought into this shit?  I'm not supposed to be doing this.  I know.  It's like a therapy session now for young David.  Now this is your first.  This is like the appetizer.  I'm going to get you a hooker.  Yeah.  And you're going to take her.  Right?  I don't care if you play dreidel with her or whatever the fuck you want.  Whatever you want.  Whatever lands the tin lands on, do that.  Sexual dreidel.  David, should we call your dad about this?  The hooker thing?  No.  No.  He wouldn't appreciate that shit.  Would your father get mad? 
[03:30:00]  He would.  Because they want him with a Jewish girl.  Right?  Okay.  And that's it.  I've never seen a Jewish girl.  A Jewish hooker.  It's hard to come by that deal.  Are they?  I would think so.  Yeah.  You'd have to Craigless that.  Yeah.  That's a tough one.  Fucking crazy.  Who's your favorite actress?  Who do you like?  Who do you think is really hot as an actress?  I like a lot of...  I know, so it won't be hard to name one.  Yeah.  Pick one.  Pick one.  Let's go.  Yeah.  I like Jennifer Aniston.  I like...  Oh.  All right.  Okay.  Jennifer Aniston. 
[03:30:30]  Can you get him Jennifer Aniston?  Shit, I'd fuck Jennifer Aniston.  Fuck her in a music rally.  Are you crazy?  I fuck her in front of my family.  What are you doing?  You know what I'm doing.  Get out.  With DL saying, you gotta aim a little lower than that.  I know.  You're not in the same way.  That's some type sales.  You said a favorite actress.  What about Blair from...  Yeah.  Facts of Life.  Would you fuck her?  Well, Blair was actually the blonde one, wasn't she?  Yeah, but she was kind of fat.  Yeah.  Which one was Blair?  No.  Oh, forget it. 
[03:31:00]  What about the fat one?  Oh.  She was Jewish.  Was she Jewish?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  She was.  What about Laverne from Laverne and Shirley?  You dumb fucker.  Rip the L off her tit.  The L.  Oh, my God.  He's going to kill somebody, man.  Oh, yeah.  There's no doubt he's coming in.  He's going to kill somebody.  Coming back.  You know what?  Take him.  You seem like a cool young dude.  Mm-hmm.  In between the times you're beating the shit out of him for no reason.  I'm going to give you the money. 
[03:31:30]  Okay.  You take him out and hire a hooker.  What do you think?  A decent...  We can't give him a...  $7,000.  Fuck.  What?  What does the bitch do after that?  $7,000.  She fucking cries.  $7,000.  She has to quit the business.  What does a hooker cost here?  Shit.  Eh, you get yourself one for...  I can tell you.  It's two...  It's two...  Well, it depends on...  Well...  It's two...  It's around $150 for a half hour, $200 for the full hour, but that's...  But then you're going to have to tip them to actually have intercourse. 
[03:32:00]  Some of them will just jerk you off.  Maybe...  Okay.  Okay.  What about...  Then we can send them to a massage parlor on 30th between 8th and 7th.  Best one in New York City.  You can take a steam and a shower and they wash your balls.  You know the whole thing.  And they give you a good massage and then they jerk you off at the end.  But whatever.  Well, how's that sound?  He knows the whole story.  I know, but I know, but how's this sound?  Why don't you send them to a massage parlor?  That'd be good.  Okay.  Yeah, can I...  Would you like a handy?  You want a little happy ending?  That's nice.  Yeah, and rub the tension off and then beating the shit out of you. 
[03:32:30]  Listen, you can stick your hand under their bra and rub those little flat Asian boobies.  Or you can grab the bum while she's jerking you off.  And if you get lucky, they'll fucking rub your cornhole.  Shit, where is this place?  Between 8th, you're going to get fast and it's up until 12.  I have a coffee mug hanging in the locker room.  Hey, look.  I'm going to give you a couple hundred dollars, right?  Okay.  Wait a minute. 
[03:33:00]  Wait a minute.  Someone should go with him.  I know, he's going.  No, fuck him.  I'm married.  I need to go.  And can I go to jail for this?  Yes.  No, I don't think so.  Yes.  You're actually right now...  Okay.  Look, take $200.  Oh my God.  And then you...  Damn, look at this guy.  No, no, take it, man.  Take this fucking money.  I don't know if I should take it.  I'm not a dope dealer with the money.  I'm not actually making you do anything.  Once I touch that, go ahead.  Take the money.  Go ahead, David.  Take the money.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
[03:33:30]  This is what you do.  Now, listen, let me explain to you first.  I was good acting by David, by the way.  You need to take the money.  I'm going to tell you, it's $100 at the door.  Right.  And then you tip him $40.  Right.  Don't tip him fucking the other $100.  She's just jerking you.  No.  Get changed, dummy.  Listen.  Holy shit.  Listen, don't give her the other...  You give her $40 or maybe $50 if she gave you a nice nut.  Right.  And she rubbed the little fucking radio hole.  Right.  Okay.  But don't give him the other $50.  Sam, walk him through this. 
[03:34:00]  I will.  And then you keep the other $50, all right?  So then you can go to like a...  I hope he can get a...  A shot of penicillin.  I hope he gets busted in a stink.  D.O. just did the math in his head.  He's like, fuck, I just wasted $50.  No, you're going to do it, right?  Yes.  You promise.  I promise.  I don't know where the place is.  It's on the 30th?  We'll find it for you.  Between 7th and 8th.  Okay.  All right.  I'm not going to say where because I don't want him to get busted.  It's my favorite place.  Very clean.  The ladies are very nice. 
[03:34:30]  They give you...  It's a legitimate massage.  You can go in the steam room for a while.  I think they'll let you wear your windbreaker.  Yeah.  But you can't put the hood over your head.  All right.  So you're going, right?  Sure.  Yes.  Okay.  So happy...  It's a Hanukkah present from me.  That's nice.  That's very nice to you.  Yeah, right.  What a great Hanukkah.  And you make sure you...  And then you know what?  And then after you get laid, you come in and you knock the fuck out of him.  I'm like, you know, that's right.  Deeper voice.  He'll sound better.  And then fuck him in the ass. 
[03:35:00]  I was just bullshitting about the last two parts of those.  Right.  I know.  But you get...  And have a good time, man.  Relax.  You deserve it.  You're an intern.  And then go home and just go to your room.  And when your father asks what's wrong, just say you don't want to talk about it.  All right?  Just do that.  Say, hey, motherfucker.  No, no, no.  Don't ever try that thing against your day.  But you...  So you're doing it today, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, today.  All right.  After the show, yep.  So Monday, I'm going to call in and see what happens.  Are you going to call in?  I'm going to call in to see what happens. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, you better spend his money.  This could be a turning point.  You better do it right.  You know what?  You might go home tonight and throw that head you have in a box in your closet out.  Just fucking start a whole new life.  Yeah, man.  And you don't have to wear the part on the side like that.  Just give that a...  Yeah.  The windbreaker and the part on the side.  Can we change that right now?  Yeah, move it around.  Just, like, mess up your hair.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, go back.  Look, Sam, get a little water.  Put a little water.  Yeah.  You look like the nerd in Greece. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, God damn.  That guy, yeah.  What was that guy's name?  I don't know, but I know who you're talking about.  Okay, throw the pie.  No, no, I'm fine.  Hey, uh, that part's been there since, like, there's eight.  Help him with his hair.  Actually, no.  There you go.  There, see?  Yeah, help him with his hair.  Oh, look at that.  There you go.  There you go.  Nice.  Look at what changing, David.  There was only a little gel.  There is gel and then she's got a little water.  No, she's got gel.  A little water.  Oh, girl, girl.  Now, see?  Oh, see?  Oh, see? 
[03:36:30]  Oh, see?  Oh, see?  Hey, David.  David, David, you give me that 200, I'll beat the fuck out of Sam right now.  Motherfucker, what are you doing to me?  Motherfucker.  What are you doing to you?  We're just styling hair.  You poured like a whole ball of water on my hand.  All right, David, I'll take 50.  I'll smack Sam right in the face for you right now.  Give me 50.  And I'll fuck him in the ass.  Okay.  I mean, no.  For your pleasure.  So, you know what?  You can suffer all these insults, but just know in the 30 minutes you're going to get 
[03:37:00]  the rub down of your life.  Right.  You're going to have a good time.  So, you've got something to look forward to.  So, it's 30th between 8th and 7th, 7th and 8th?  Stop repeating it.  The fuck?  Just call the cops on yourself.  Jesus Christ.  David, I'll tell you off the air exactly where it ends.  All right, gotcha.  Ask for Camille.  It's an Asian pill.  This could be the biggest massage parlor plus in New York City.  Right.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You go in.  This is a recipe for disaster.  Oh, my goodness.  Very nice.  Okay. 
[03:37:30]  You don't have to worry about getting AIDS.  So, it's just, it's very clean.  It better be.  They give you a real massage.  Yeah.  Don't you worry.  Who's bringing them down there?  Just make sure you don't, you know.  David, at the end.  Well, David.  I get 200 bucks away to go.  You should have enough for a taxi, right?  I'll wait for a year.  Oh, yeah.  He has enough for a taxi and a sandwich.  You get a taxi, a sandwich, and a nice pizza.  This is the whole thing.  Batteries included.  Right.  You included everything.  David, at the end, when she turns you over and you have a hard-on, hopefully, right?  And she's like, oh, you're stressful here. 
[03:38:00]  Don't go, no, I'm not.  It's my back.  Right.  Yeah.  Why would I do that?  I'm just making sure.  Yeah, because they might not ask you.  Like, they're not going to be specific.  Yeah, they don't really.  They give you a back rub, and they make it, like, legit.  And then they roll you over, but they might tickle your asshole a little bit, like, graze  your nut with a fingernail, and tickle it a little bit, and then they roll you over,  and they giggle, like, oh, look at this.  You look like that.  You look like that disgusting.  Do they really giggle at you?  They always giggle.  When they see the hard cock, they're like, oh.  I'd be fucking so mad.  Mad.  Stop giggling. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, I love it.  Giggling ass.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, they stop giggling when they have to clean up your hot load.  My dead babies are stuck between their knuckles and their wedding ring.  This is fucking horrible, man.  You got a point there, Bob.  Right.  You might as well chuckle at your dick.  And you know why he knows?  Because he's lived alive.  Oh, yeah.  He's not so much about this.  He's lived life.  Listen, dude.  That's the, that's the, that's what, do you, what do you look forward to every day? 
[03:39:00]  I look forward to just parting your hair to the side.  Definitely, man.  Just look forward to just being alive and having, being grateful for a living.  Yeah, but you gotta live, though, man.  Yeah.  You gotta eat, drink.  Women are the best thing ever, man.  You're existing.  You're not, like, living.  Women are the best thing ever.  Does that feel good when she touches your hair?  Yeah, it feels good.  Eddie Deason.  Really?  Yeah.  Eddie Deason.  See, that's very cool.  Keep your hair like that, dude.  Yeah, now you're looking a little more, uh, look at that, it's spiked down a little  bit. 
[03:39:30]  Right.  You less, you look less B&H photo.  Would you like a Calzeo lens with that, sir?  That's a great place.  This place is great, isn't it?  Luminix.  Hey, man, this, I hope this is the runway that you've just taken off, man.  You've learned efficiency from somewhere.  Just have a fucking good time.  Eat, drink, get a nice chin.  And if you don't do this, you're gonna have to answer to him.  Right, man.  Screw answering to Sam, you're gonna have to answer to the main show.  I bet you right now, he goes and invests this money, and in a fucking ten years, he's  a multimillionaire. 
[03:40:00]  He fucking owns CBS and it sounds.  Let me tell you about the day D.L. Ubly made me a millionaire.  I want to tell you.  Oh, yeah, I shot my load, all right.  I took it to action.  I could have jerked off into my own stomach, but I didn't.  I shot my load into pharmaceuticals.  I think.  Yes, yes, yes.  He's probably the secret millionaire for that show you were talking about earlier.  This yellow jacket was the same jacket I wore that day. 
[03:40:30]  This was the jacket I was wearing.  David.  You might have to wear that yellow jacket with all the sperm you got in.  Yeah.  It's like a brain slicker.  Fucking A, right?  So you're gonna do this like now?  When the show ends, yeah.  Well, the show's ended.  It's over for you.  Go right now.  Take a hike.  You're in a tough spot.  Take him, man.  Take him.

[03:41:00]  Yeah, don't wince.  Don't wince when she touches.  Don't do that creepy lip shit when she's jerking you off.  Oh, my God.  All right.  She's gonna run out of that place like that little Asian girl that had napalm on her.  Happy, happy.  Come in.  Thank you so much, D.L.  You go have a good time, man.  He can't look like a stranger's attached to his lip in his cock.  Come on.  Hug my neck, man.  All right.  There's a bro hug.  There's a bro hug.  Yeah.  David.  David.  David.  David.  David.

[03:41:30]  Now you start to walk out.  See, you start to walk out.  You get the slow clap.  Man.  Come on.  Give him a pull.  There we go.  There he goes.  You know what, man?  Answering David.  Just when you think life is fucked up for you.  Yeah.  You got something like that.  You get something like that, and you don't realize, wow.  It could have been me.  There, but for the grace of God.  There for the grace of God.  I'm a Catholic.  Parenting, and good friends, and everything else go I.  Personality.  I mean, it was one experience.  Because, you know, everybody wishes they could take back five minutes of their life.  Five minutes.  Yeah. 
[03:42:00]  One experience, man.  You could have been that.  I could have been that.  You never know.  I wish he was the last five.  That's horrible.  I know.  What molds you into who you are?  Or who you aren't?  I don't know.  We got to get Sam to do a what's the haps.  Like, you know, tape this whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Not in.  Sam, you got to do kind of like a what's the haps.  We're outside this place.  David's going inside.  You know, that type of thing.  Right.  We got to get some audio for Monday.  David's Happy Ending is brought to you by WebEx.com.

We have no club rules, you know.  It's an open door for you, man.  When Patrice is gone, I'll slide in.  You're on the West Coast.  That's the problem.  No, I'm here.  You're now here full time.  I live in Tribeca. 
[03:43:00]  We can start doing our show more often.  I live in Tribeca, man.  Whatever you want, man.  Every time we tell you it's an open door policy.  Well, you know people say that.  We mean it.  Stop by and then you do it like, who the fuck is this all about?  Yeah, who the fuck is this?  Send him away.  You're looking weird.  Right.  So then, you know.  But I do.  I moved to New York now.  It's a different kind of experience for me.  I'm lonely here.  Anytime.  We'll have Steve then.  Fucking call and say.  Yeah, man.  I'd love to.  Come on down and just fucking hang.  Why did you just hand your $200 to Intern Davis?  Why don't you go with him? 
[03:43:30]  Man, you know.  That was a nice gesture.  Man, that made me feel literally I felt horrible for him.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I felt bad for him.  It's just like the youth of the third grade type shit.  Yeah, it was.  It's that third grade.  Brutal.  Bobby brought up a point earlier where he said, yeah, I tried to be a bully once in school and stuff.  Like, I tried to get.  There was a crowd of like bullies and I wanted to kind of be in with them.  And they were really fucking with this kid so bad.  And I just was like, I can't do this.  Right.  I felt like awful doing it. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  They were punching this kid in the stomach just to see the funny face he made when they did it.  No.  And then it's like, yeah, go ahead.  Do it.  Do it the same thing.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I did.  Do the face he made.  I did it later in life when I became a punk punk when I was hanging out with those older  kids.  Yeah.  I was associated with these douchebags.  And I did some.  I stole a kid's moped once and took a CD player once.  I actually.  This is what I got my shit together.  Stopped drinking.  Stopped drugging.  You know, the whole deal.  Right.  I went to college, worked my way out of fucking really bad classrooms.  The shit rubber rooms in the basement. 
[03:44:30]  Still a piece of shit.  Went to college, get to English class.  I feel like I finally did something with my life.  That motherfucker I used to pick on, the guy took his moped and he's in my class.  And I was like, hey, I'm Robert.  He goes, I know who the fuck you are.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I was like, dude, please.  He never forgot.  I still could have kicked his ass so he didn't fuck with me.  Oh, okay.  I should have shook him.  Yeah, man.  That stuff sticks with you.  Yeah, it made me feel like shit.  And the thing I feel the worst about, like when you're growing up, you do shit because  you want people to think you're cool. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  But the coolest shit is to do the shit you want to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the coolest shit to go.  Ah, fuck.  That ain't cool to me.  I told this story like a while ago.  I was in the hallway of school and there was this girl.  She wasn't cute, but she wasn't ugly or anything like that.  So you beat her and raped her?  Yeah.  So I just fucked her in the asshole.  She was at her locker and God damn, Bobby.  Some shit late.  So is Bobby.  I thought Norton was bad, but you literally.  Bobby is just the worst.  You know what? 
[03:45:30]  I take it too far.  I apologize.  Oh, my God.  Norton knows how to finesse it in and make it, you know, acceptable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's over the top, Bob.  Right.  Sorry.  Over the top, Bob.  Okay, so what happened?  You were fucking her in the ass?  Yeah, no, no.  I'm fucking her in the ass.  She was screaming.  No, she had her head in the locker and she was doing something.  And these guys came by and kicked her locker.  And it smacked her in the fucking head.  Oh, my God.  And she starts crying.  She's there crying.  I'm like three lockers over.  She's crying on the floor.  And then you went over and pissed on her face?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  Fucking Bobby.  Wow.  And you know something? 
[03:46:00]  I wanted to go over there and console her a little bit and call those guys assholes  and shit like that.  I didn't do anything.  I just stood there and kind of looked at her.  Yeah.  I looked at the guys who were laughing and shit.  And I'm just like, and it's one of those moments that sticks with me because it's like,  you could have just kind of gone over and go, hey, are you okay?  Don't mind those fucking assholes or something like that.  And not even as a ploy to get laid or anything.  Right.  Just to be like kind of a decent human being.  Just be human.  Yeah.  When you see someone really get fucked over like that for no reason.  And I just fucking stood there and did nothing because I knew those guys would have gotten 
[03:46:30]  on my shit if I would have gone over there.  So you just don't do it.  When I was a kid, though, no, but some things you, like I would see just people do the most  brutal shit like growing up.  Like I grew up on 135th and a half months ago, one time I was a kid, I was 13 years old.  I could have been 12.  And these dudes like, we got this girl and she wants us to do a training.  And I'm like, no, she doesn't.  Get out of here.  So I go, right.  And this girl is screaming and crying.  And I'm like, this is, this girl is scared to fucking death.  Thanks for bringing me to a fucking race.  Right. 
[03:47:00]  These are the old dudes in the neighborhood.  So I'm like, hey, man, this is not like, and 12 years old, like these dudes, I'm like,  this is not whatever the words I were, cool or whatever.  Yeah.  So I said, no.  And I take her home and this girl is crying so bad that her brother runs out the house  thinking that I did something to her and she's so fucking emotional.  She can't talk.  And he's chasing me around a car with a butcher knife.  And then she finally gets out.  Like he is close to catching me.  I could like literally feel him.  Like, you know, I already feel the knife fucking going in. 
[03:47:30]  And she goes, no, no, it wasn't him.  It wasn't him.  It wasn't him.  And then he says, well, you're going to take me to the motherfuckers that did it.  And I'm like, man, I got to live with these dudes.  So you might as well cut me.  Now, I can't like, like 12 years old.  I'm going to go tell these, I already stopped them from doing something.  I brought her here.  That's my decency quota for the fucking day.  Oh, man, he literally tried to make me.  I said, well, and I was trying to, at 12 years old, you really don't know what to say.  So I'm like, just cut me, man, because I can't go back to these dudes. 
[03:48:00]  Makes my pussy-ass white bread locker story look like shit.  And tell them, man, what am I, like, I'm going to tell on these dudes and I got a liver?  This kid's going to take a fucking knife from some code that doesn't exist.  No, no, not even a code.  It wasn't even a code.  It was just that I couldn't, I couldn't live with these dudes and tell a dude from my,  tell another dude from another day who, on the dudes in my neighborhood, tell on them.  They'd have fucked you up.  Yeah, but see, dude, that's a fuck.  I'm talking about not even tell him so that he can go to jail, but tell him, they would 
[03:48:30]  have, he would have done something to them.  Then they would have said, you, man, I got to live there?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I was like, man, you might as well cut me.  I don't, I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Did he ever find out?  But he went like this, okay, funk.  No.  And then just stabbed him.  It's not that he was.  It was, it was a choice.  I said, either I'm going to, somebody's going to do it, so I might as well do it here.  And he didn't.  He was so mad.  I was like, man, that's the last time I get involved in this shit again.  Yeah, right.  Last time I stop a rape, I'm just going to let it happen next time.  I get involved in rape. 
[03:49:00]  Right.  It's ears depressing me.  Like Charlie Sheen after they went in that village.  Fuck it off.  They're human fucking being.  What is wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  Police up your dicks.  That's when I see a guy like David, man, he's just, that's just horrible that he just,  like, how do you live like that?  How are you so passive like that?  He's a fucking gazelle waiting to just get ripped apart at the lion's watering hole.  In New York.  No kidding. 
[03:49:30]  We got Sam back in here.  How's David handling everything that went down?  Well, he's kind of processing everything.  He keeps asking me, am I really going?  Yes.  Are you going with me?  Am I going by myself?  Are you sure you have time?  Dude, you got to just take him.  Yeah, I know.  You got to just jump in a cab right now before it wears off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go right now.  Tape the ride in a cab.  You need cab money?  No, he's got $50.  We got a bit more for the cab and stuff.  Quick before he buys a treasury bond. 
[03:50:00]  I bought gold.  I bought gold.  My name is Goldberg.  It's a good investment.  It's a good investment.  Danny Goldberg.  Do a little interviewing in the cab.  Okay.  Let's see.  A little interview as you point out the location and then send him on his way and then it shouldn't  take more than one.  This is great.  What if Sam and Dave were really lovers and they just took this money, went to a restaurant  and fucked each other in the park?  You certainly have bizarre fantasies there, Robert.  I'm just fucking just thinking.  It's a radio show.  I'm trying to add.  Robert, is there a code?  Is Dave going to like blow up his spot when he goes in there? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, the code is finger fuck my asshole while you jerk me off.  Put two knuckles in.  Subtle.  That is heavy.  Go past your ring finger.  Bobby, should he say that he heard about this place from a national talk show?  No, no, no.  The thing that I always have to convince him that I'm not an undercover cop.  Because I look like every fucking shithead on NYPD Blue.  Gnar kind of.  But if these two walk in, they'd be like, come in, faggots. 
[03:51:00]  I'd probably be waiting for David outside of the establishment.  No, they have a wait.  Yeah, don't go.  If you're not going to do it, yeah.  There's a waiting room.  Some guy would walk in and point at you.  I want him to do it.  You see Sam in a white smock.  Right.  Sam, are you devil joining?  Can you keep a secret?  I need those things.  I just want you to know that I feel horrible right now.  You should feel good.  You did a good thing.  You want your money back?  No, no, no.  I just want him to have a good time.  He'll have a good time. 
[03:51:30]  Bring him back.  We'll get him to the left side.  It's a great time.  And after you're done, take him in the sauna and let him do the spa.  Let him relax a little bit.  Get his schvitz.  Wait a minute.  He has to.  Wait.  He has to get the table shower.  Okay.  They wash you.  So should he ask for a table shower?  No.  Yes.  Go look.  You go in.  He gets a locker.  Takes his clothes off.  Gets in a robe or a towel.  Gets in a towel.  Then he puts all his stuff in.  Takes his key.  Go in.  Say, I want a table shower.  This really hot. 
[03:52:00]  He's never going to remember all this.  He'll remember table shower.  It's crazy.  Spanish girl is going to wash him down on a fucking wet bed.  Scrub his asshole, his balls.  He's going to get a hard on.  He might even blow his nut right there.  It almost happens.  Then they dry you off, put a robe on you, flip-flops, and then they whisk you out the  door where an Asian lady will take you and do that little Asian-Japanese tiptoe walk  all the way to a room.  Okay.  And then they give you a massage.  So table shower.  Take your clothes off.  Locker.  Table shower.  And then they'll send you on the way. 
[03:52:30]  That's fantastic.  It's like dominoes after that.  Is he going to have enough money for all this?  Dude, that's only $140.  It's for everything.  Everything?  Yeah, everything.  And the table shower?  You can get a cheaper one on Fifth Ave, but that's my place.  I don't want to blow that spot up.  Because that girl immediately just puts you on all fours and starts tickling your asshole  and jerking you off backwards.  There's no way I'm blowing that spot up.  Really?  Yeah.  And she's kind of hot.  You guys are laughing.  I'm going.  Where is this place?  Yeah, I know. 
[03:53:00]  Bobby, doesn't Bobby make a fucking whorehouse sound charming?  Oh, God.  It sounds charming.  Oh, God.  I love that place.  This will let you sell Chrysler.  You're whisked away, he says.  It's a fucking handjob joint.  I was confused by how you were describing the first place.  I'm like, why is he telling everyone where this spot is?  I knew you had something in your head.  I got my secret spots that I don't fucking tell you about.  So you're not giving out the secret spots.  No, not at all.  That's the one.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  The table shower is the one he's going to.  Yeah.  I mean, they have a table shower with my one, but the one I go to is way better because  they spend like 20 minutes on the table shower.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They wash everything.  And I mean everything.  Goodness gracious.  This one's very professional.  What else is there to wash?  Really?  What else are they washing that they're not supposed to be?  Everything.  Yeah.  Oh, it's gorgeous.  It's just fucking gorgeous.  This one's really comfortable.  They play that music while you're getting.  I'm sure he'll enjoy it.  Yeah.  It's good.  What music did they play? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, I was kind of, when he did that, I was like, what?  Banjo?  It's that three fucking string guitar.  Bong, bong, bong.  That killed Bill shit.  Chinese banjo.  Sounds fantastic, man.  I like half the theme from Deliverance.  What the fuck it sounds like?  All right, Sam, you're busy.  Go get David.  Yeah, bring him a cab.  Go to him.  We got to get the fuck out of here, too.  You should actually just jerk him off in the cab and take the 200.  Just kick him out of the cab.  He's a little stupid. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  What is wrong with you, man?  We learned what's wrong with him today.  This motherfucker here, anytime you can make Jim Norton seem like a nice guy.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, God damn.  Kelly's got some problems, too.  Yeah.  Well, really, I mean, come on.  I don't have to.  It's a little similar.  I don't have to put trash bags on my fucking bathroom floor.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  When you're at that point.  Yeah.  And the one who's doing it is a buddy of yours. 
[03:55:00]  When you're both calling each other fella.  Good job.  Oh, my fucking goodness gracious.  So, this is good.  You guys are watching this.  I like this girl on MSNBC.  Which one?  Oh, which one's that?  Pretty black girl.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want the short hair?  Oh, man.  She's in New York, huh?  Which girl?  The girl who's covering the store.  Yeah, she's really.  How's that going to work out?  You're on scene, man.  Oh, they found her body.  It's fucking great.  Kaylee's body found.  They're not.  It's looking like it, but they're not.  What a fucking psycho. 
[03:55:30]  What do you think?  She ran off to fucking become a longshoreman?  Of course she was dead.  Lookit, she's a psycho.  You can tell.  No shit.  Look at that fake smile.  I'm going to kill this fucking kid.  She's kind of hot, dude.  She's this girl.  Yeah, that girl.  Oh, they switched back.  Oh, look at that.  Amy Robach.  Is that?  No, I'm talking about the other way.  What the fuck is going on with her?  She's taking a picture.  She's sitting on a plunger.  Does anyone know they're on camera?  What the hell is going on?  She's sitting on a plunger. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, look at that.  They're all showing a little leg.  Boots.  Look at that one.  Man, that's pretty nice.  That's pretty nice.  I got to see.  What's going on?  Amy's all right.  They're really trying to get ratings.  What happened?  David's leaving officially.  Oh, David's walking out the door.  Everybody's giving him a fond farewell.  He's going to come back a new man.  I don't know.  It's like fucking Porky's Five.  It's terrible.  You know this is going to be a disaster.  Of course it's going to be a disaster.  You need to call 911 right now as like a father and go, my son is it. 
[03:56:30]  And we need to get this place fucking ratted out.  This is absolutely not going to work out.  Something will fuck up.  I'll tell you what's going to happen.  What?  E-Rock.  E-Rock's coming in smiling.  So either he just had a big hero sandwich or something happened.  Maybe both.  Oh.  No, Sam's trying to get him out of the office.  He's like, come on, let's go, let's go.  David says, you're going to leave me there.  Sam's, no, I'll wait.  This isn't a ditching of somebody.  Hold on.  Even if he does, he's got 200 in his pocket.  He's got a place to be ditched, right? 
[03:57:00]  What could go wrong?  I had a fucking Yankee Cranky joint with a couple hundred bucks in your pocket.  Oh, damn it.  I'm ditched.  It's only like 20 or so blocks from here.  What is he talking about?  So Sam says, no, I'll wait till you're done, but I'm not going in.  And David just goes, but what if it takes like an hour or more?  Slow down there, champ.  First time out.  What?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you, Sting?  Yeah.  All tantric shit.  He's going to put a towel over his pocket and blow his load. 
[03:57:30]  He's going to put a towel over the pocket.  It's going to be fucking cum on the hundred.  And he pulls it out of his pocket.  That motherfucker is done in three seconds.  Oh, my goodness.  You remember the first time a girl touched your fucking dick?  Forget about it.  Ridiculous.  That was like, the first thing that goes through your mind is why does this feel so much different  and better than when I touch it myself?  Does it have to be a girl, my memory?  Oh, shit. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, I should have known.  I'm sorry.  I should include people like you.  Could it be that guy who promised me a steak?  Or the uncle that helped you make bow and arrows?  All the stories that you fucking told over the years.  Now remember, kids, you don't want Uncle Sam to kill you.  You could keep a secret, Robert.  What do we always say?  Don't tell her.  We'll kill your parents.  That's spectacular.  Creepy uncle that gives you a puppy for Christmas. 
[03:58:30]  He can make like he's going to strangle it.  Bobby, tell your dog story before we get out of here.  That tragic dog story.  You started with, what was your kid's name again?  Oh, shit.  What happened?  His wedding ring?  Yeah, I just lost my diamond.  Oh, shit.  Your diamond fell out of your wedding ring?  Uh-oh.  Or your wedding band?  That's your wife doing some voodoo shit.  She's been listening to the show.  See?  You talk like that and fucking karma. 
[03:59:00]  That is, I'm not even kidding you.  Every time I fucking talk dirty or something.  A diamond falls out of your ring?  Why did you, you don't believe me?  What, were you assessing it?  An angel gets his wings.  Get David back in here.  David's looking at it through one of those loops in his eye.  What the fuck?  Is this thing clarity?  Carrot?  Does it have the three, the four C?  Yes.  Bobby, you don't even know where you lost it.  It could be anywhere.  I think I just lost it right now, dude.  How big a diamond is it?  Very small.  Very small.  It's a chip.  Oh, okay. 
[03:59:30]  So, oh, all right.  It's a diamond, though.  Oh, my God.  Well, we'll get on the phone.  That's a nice watch.  Now we're all looking for a diamond.  Yeah, we'll take the watch.  That's a beautiful watch.  Are we all getting on the floor now?  Yeah, where's the diamond?  I don't quite see us.  We need David's fucking bifocals right now.  David could just sniff those out like a fucking bloodhound.  You know?  That's what I hear.  I don't know.  Yeah, I was going to say, what do you guys do?  Have a fight?  Yeah.  No one's looking. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, is that insured, that ring there, Robert?  Of course not.  Is this it?  I don't know.  What are you holding up?  God, I remember so many nights when I used to fucking freebase coke of doing the same thing,  looking in the carpet for a little speck.  There's got to be something in there.  I think I put a piece of pretzel salt in a pipe once and smoked it.  I was sure it was something else.  This shit has turned into the Rick James story.  Yeah, just fucking hands and knees.  Damn. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, the good old days.  It's terrible.  All right.  You found it?  Did you?  No.  Is your wife going to give you shit?  No, I fucking paid for it.  What's she going to fucking pitch up off?  It's not like you came back without the ring.  No, is she going to give you shit about the stories you've been telling?  No, I don't let her listen to this fucking show.  Are you out of your mind?  That's the big one.  All right.  I shut the computers off, and I think I broke the XM receiver in my house.  Good man.  Because one day I came up, and she goes, I heard you today.  Oh, you don't need that right now. 
[04:01:00]  That's the last you'll ever hear.  My, I lost that fucking diamond.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  I've got to go down to that stupid street with the big diamonds on it now.  Yeah.  Get a brand new one.  Yeah, you'll be all right.  How do they put a diamond in there?  I don't know.  That's God telling me.  You've got one more.  I've got one more diamond left.  One more, and that's it.  It's over.  One more, and then you've got to stop.  All right.  It's scary.  I might as well waste it.  So we've got David on his way to a Yankee Cranky shop.  Yeah, well, we've got D.L. Hughley just killing for us today, and we're all going  to be watching Breaks the News on CNN.  Thank you.  And I'm playing. 
[04:01:30]  Where am I playing at?  I'm playing at.  Oh, you're doing a gig, too?  I'm playing Hasbrook Heights tonight.  Oh, sweet.  And then I'm going to Governor's next week.  And Governor's, nice.  Yeah, I don't even know what Governor's is.  Are you really in New York now?  I live in Tribeca.  Then fucking come by.  I do.  How are we going to do this?  Should we just call you every once in a while?  Anytime, man.  All right.  Anytime.  That's what we'll do.  We'll do shifts.  Yeah.  That way Patrice will come.  Yeah.  When he's not knocking the bottom out of Dutch whores.  That's a great story.  When he's not splitting their wigs. 
[04:02:00]  Who's not retiring whores.  That's a great story, man.  Nine, nine, nine.  No, he's a great.  I'll never get that visual out of my head.  I'll tell you, the first jerk-off place I ever went to was in Philadelphia.  And Patrice was there.  And we went in.  And the lady was behind the door going, no, no, we're closed.  We're closed.  So me and the other guy were standing like, what the fuck?  They're not closed.  We know they're open.  No, go away.  No, closed.  Then we turn around.  We see Patrice behind us.  We're like, gosh, dude, can you step outside? 
[04:02:30]  Oh, shit.  As soon as he fucking left, she went, come in, quick.  He was just a big guy, though.  It wasn't a race thing.  Now, how do you know it wasn't a race thing?  I'm sorry.  It was.  You're right.  It was.  I mean, but how do you know, though?  It was both.  It was race.  Right, right.  Big and black is always good for jail.  It's little two white guys like this waiting for their little cocks.  And then this big guy behind them.  Yeah, that's what happens to me all the time.  Every time Red is around, because he looks like a big swole up tail wings.  Yeah.  And it's always funny how much nicer people are when he's not around. 
[04:03:00]  Patrice is an imposing figure.  Yeah, he's a lot of dude.  He's a big guy.  Even though he's a sweetheart, though.  I know.  He's great.  He's great.  And you know what?  He used to look a lot more dangerous and a lot scarier when he used to just dress in  the jerseys and shit and stuff.  And he dressed in jerseys and fucking, you know, baseball cap and shit.  Now the motherfucker's wearing, like, velvet fedoras.  Yeah.  And fuck, he's wearing, he's dressed like Huggy Bear, the motherfucker.  And he looks great.  He looks, like, fucking so sharp when he walks around. 
[04:03:30]  Nice jacket, alligator shoes and shit.  He just looks like a big fucking...  Yeah, he's making a little one.  He does look like the whole cast of Harlem Nights now.  Even the big lady.  What was her name?  Della Reese.  Della Reese.  Fucking Della Reese.  God, was she funny.  You gonna shoot me in my pinky toe?  Oh, it's all motherfuckers.  You hit like a bitch.  Yeah, you're fucking funny, dude.  Think I saw that movie a time with you?  Hey, Bobby, you're doing radio this weekend?  No. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, Saturday night.  Yeah, yeah.  You taped it already?  No, I'm doing it Saturday night.  I'm doing it live.  Is this somebody from Maiden's looking with a flashlight?  Yeah, he's looking for a glimmer.  Russman Eve's here.  I see him in the back there.  Yeah, we're gonna be doing a show.  Look at this area here, because I think I saw him flailing his arms around.  Yeah, Russman Eve is, we're gonna be doing the show this Saturday night.  Me and...  Cool, man.  ...man Eve.  Hey, B, maybe it happened when you were pushing the shit out of Bobby over here.  Looks like New Lily's digging Russman Eve.  What's that about?  Who's New Lily?  Is that the redhead girl?  Nah.  Nah, this thing. 
[04:04:30]  New Lily is...  What?  This thing.  There, over there.  This thing.  Russ, come on in for a moment.  We're trying to get off the radio.  She should be down at the place.  She should be at the place where David's going.  Is that New Lily right there?  Yeah, bring her in.  Come here.  Come on in, New Lily.  We'll try not to get you suspended.  No, we will try to get you suspended.  It's so funny.  Hey, what's happening?  Hi, Bob.  Hi, sweetie.  How are you?  Good.  How about on mic?  There you go.  You could have my mic.  Hi, Lily.  Hi, Opie.  How are you?  Hi. 
[04:05:00]  Hearing you on the Ron and Fez show.  Yes.  This just turned into Grey's Anatomy.  I won't get you guys fired.  I'm a big supporter of your Asian jokes.  Oh, you like the Asian jokes?  Really?  Yeah, I'm a big fan of any...  It's never jokes.  It's always truth.  Yeah.  Like this morning, I was commenting on driving in Chinatown.  That's the place where you're most likely to run someone over because they fucking walk  right out in front of your vehicles.  I can't.  They fucking walk right out in front of you. 
[04:05:30]  I'm 20 years old.  I don't have a driver's license.  What are you?  Chinese or Korean?  Chinese.  Chinese.  Nice.  Russ has a fancy.  That's not true.  You don't like the Asian?  I do.  You do?  I do.  I don't specifically target that demographic, though.  All right.  I just thought that you liked the Asians.  There we go.  Russ is very handsome.  Whoa.  I changed that.  I actually do target that.  Have you ever given a Yankee Cranky?  Yeah.  No.  You have?  But not for money. 
[04:06:00]  Oh, okay.  Just for dinner or something?  Oh, you gave a massage and then a handjob, like in that order?  Yeah, but usually with people I'm already involved with, not with strangers.  Okay.  So you knew, but you gave him a massage and then when he rolled over, like, ooh, volcano,  this is where all your stress is.  No.  She's talking about relationships.  Oh, wow, wow.  Not fucking hand for hire.  How great would that be, though?  Just a fucking role play.  Like, you put, you know, like, hello.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That'd be sexy.  That would kind of be funny. 
[04:06:30]  Yeah, just be like, oh, this is where your stress is.  Yeah, Bobby likes when Asians tickles his asshole, so.  Well, well, wait, wait.  Oh, wow.  Well, she's right here.  I mean.  You're trying to what?  Yeah, you're right, Russ.  You're absolutely right.  You're walking in the air.  There's no trying.  I do like my asshole played with, or the male G-spot, as I like to call it.  Right, right.  Bobby, you sound like a fucking tea kettle.  Is somebody set a fire alarm off?  I think Bobby kind of has, like, Asian features to him.  Don't you?  Yeah.  His eyes are kind of, like, slanty. 
[04:07:00]  God, if you were still fat, fucking slip a Buddha joke in so fast.  Goddamn.  I hate the slender, fucking fit Bob.  Uh-huh.  Pisses me off.  I'll be back.  When you were a big, fat, disgusting fuck.  Yes.  It was so much fun.  Yeah.  We could goof on you.  Fuck yeah.  Remember when you were just a blubbery, fucking fat, useless, piece of shit, stupid motherfucker?  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  I didn't know you felt that way. 
[04:07:30]  You fucking bald asshole.  Goddamn.  Goddamn.  That is right.  I got follicles.  Six months.  You just put in.  Six months, I'm going to have a great head of hair, motherfucker.  Are you from New York?  Yeah.  All right.  She's unbelievably gorgeous.  You're very pretty.  You're very pretty.  Thank you, DL.  You really are.  You really are.  I think I said it first, and then he picked up on me.  That's cool.  Go ahead.  I didn't hear you.  Well, I like her at home.  Are you single?  I am single.  Whoa.  All right.  Are you done with Johnny?  Can you keep a secret?  What kind of secret? 
[04:08:00]  Well, if I told you that, it wouldn't be a secret, would it?  Right.  You just found.  All right.  I can keep a secret.  Really?  Yeah.  What about the devil joining part?  Is that okay?  Sure.  Really?  I mean, I do like black guys, so.  You do?  Yeah.  I'm out.  Damn it.  I'm out.  Wow.  That's something you don't see very often.  I like all guys except for Asians.  Can I just say something?  Can I stop?  I talked to four Asian guys at the cellar one night, because I was like, dude, nobody  will fuck you.  Black girls won't fuck you. 
[04:08:30]  White girls won't fuck you.  Puerto Rican's won't fuck you.  Was that your opening statement?  I swear to God.  Then why are there 20 billion of them?  Somebody fuck you.  And they were like, that's why they have to force their women.  Even if women don't want, you'll fuck a black guy, white guy, anything.  They won't fuck Spanish guys.  White girls.  Spanish guys.  I mean, Chinese, Asians.  They won't.  No one fucks Asian guys.  Really?  Nobody.  Who?  Black guys, you fuck everybody.  Because that was before they discovered other guys.  Then how come there's so many?  It's true.  Do you like black guys, really?  Yeah.  What'd you say?  I like all guys except for Asians. 
[04:09:00]  Right.  You don't like the Asians.  I just don't know why.  I just, they're like.  Because they're Asian.  You got both parents?  A little tiny dude.  You do?  Yeah.  Your dad would be, would he be happy?  Yeah.  He's like.  Would he look at DL and go like, I feel sorry for your mother.  Right.  DL's got a pop up.  You would actually like me though.  I'm a very nice guy.  He trusts very nicely.  Thank you, baby.  He knows karate too.  That makes one of us.  Yeah.  You don't know karate? 
[04:09:30]  I don't know karate.  Really?  No.  Not at all.  How old are you?  20.  You're 20?  Yeah.  How many guys?  How many?  20.  In your sexual.  I've been involved with maybe three.  You've only been with three guys?  Yeah.  I started pretty late in high school.  Sex with three guys.  And has one been a black guy?  No.  Never?  You've always fantasized about it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So you haven't yet.  How do you fantasize about it?  I really like NBA basketball players.  Wow. 
[04:10:00]  Jesus Christ.  Just a fucking huge guy.  Sorry, Bobby.  I'm 5'8".  It's like.  I'm like an NBA player that watched it.  In hot water a couple of times.  He's the NBA player that wins the slam dunk contest every once in a while.  Right, right.  So in other words, you like getting punched in the eye and fucked in the ass.  You're not from Boulder, Colorado.  No, I'm just fucking around here.  So you like black guys, but you never dated one?  Yeah, because I've never really been close enough friends with one to like get to know that. 
[04:10:30]  Oh, listen.  Here, here's 200 bucks.  I want you to fuck the up.  Okay?  I'm ready.  She said, I've never been close enough friends with one.  To like date one.  Oh, you got to be friends.  Like I didn't know that.  Yeah, I'm not really a one night stand kind of person.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to go back to looking for my diamond because she wants to bang a black guy.  You know what you got to do?  You know what you got to do then?  Hang out, you know, where black guys hang out.  You go to Rikers. 
[04:11:00]  What type of shit?  She go to community college.  I'll tell you what.  I know a lot of black guys.  This is what I do.  I know a lot.  And I'm going to break it.  Like, I'm like.  Are you married, Dio?  Hey, I'm not going to say nothing fucked up.  This is a do-gooder.  See, I helped.  I helped.  I know.  Now you're going to help.  Are you going to give her money to fuck a black guy?  Then what I'm going to do.  I'm going to bring you around.  And kind of break it.  We'll find one you like.  And I'll say, okay. 
[04:11:30]  He's a decent guy.  I don't care if he's decent.  I just want to.  That would be a good hookup.  Yeah, I'm going to hook you in.  I'd be appreciative.  That's what I do.  What happened to me being handsome?  Why don't we just roll over that?  You know, I don't discriminate.  Like, except for Asians.  Back in.  Back to me.  Back in.  Back to me.  Back to me.  Back to me.  I'm a great basketball player.  Yes.  Really?  Yeah, but you don't.  Minus the oppression.  And he has an uncircumcised penis.  I know.  Minus the oppression.  Which most black guys do. 
[04:12:00]  Which is what?  I said he has an uncircumcised penis.  Forget it.  Actually, most of the guys I've been with.  Most of the three guys are Jewish.  So they have a uncircumcised penis?  Yeah.  So you've never even seen a little snuffle off of his trunk?  I've never seen an uncircumcised penis in person.  With that buggy, you think?  In person?  I don't know.  Live.  Do you want to see one?  Uncircumcised cock.  This Sunday.  One time only.  On the O'Bee and Anthony show.  Why is that snake wearing a sweater?  What is that? 
[04:12:30]  A little turtleneck.  Let's show her one.  Yeah.  Who's got an uncircumcised penis?  Anybody?  Eastside Dave.  You know, Jewish guys aren't really known for their sexual prowess.  That's not true.  But that's why I'm asking.  When you're 20, you don't know yet.  You might not know.  You might not know.  I've only been with boys, I guess.  Did they go down on you and stuff?  One did.  One did.  Did you like it?  Three out of three, only one did?  Yeah.  See, that's fucking fuck.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  I found that Jewish men or boys are very passionate. 
[04:13:00]  Really?  Yeah?  About money?  Yeah, but I didn't know.  No, because, you know, it ties into the whole neuroticism, Jewish neurotic.  Yeah.  Like, they're very eager to please their woman.  Yeah, but one out of three goes down on you, though?  I mean, that's fucking mandatory.  I'm funny.  I'm kind of young.  That's mandatory, though.  Wow.  How about an ass lick?  Anyone lick your ass?  No, I've never had a rim job.  See, what the fucking guy wearing?  Do you like that?  I don't know.  I don't know if I would like a rim job.  But you've got a sense that you would like it or not. 
[04:13:30]  You've got Robert working that wedding ring off his finger.  I already fucking ditched one of the diamonds.  Yeah, one piece at a time, he's disassembling his ring.  Anyway, what were you saying?  So you get a sense of stuff that you like.  Yeah, definitely.  So, like, what do you think you like that you haven't tried?  I would probably maybe like anal.  I haven't tried that.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Bobby, where are you going?  Bobby tapped out.  Bobby is tapped out.  We have a new champion. 
[04:14:00]  Bobby fucking tapped out.  Oh, wow.  Can I just say, and I mean this, I love you.  Not in the bullshit way, but in the way that I think you're everything I've ever been looking for.  Let's do this.  That's perfect.  Bobby came back with some tissues.  All right, what are we doing?  If I wasn't married, let me tell you, if you didn't know I was married, there would be things happening.  So you think you like anal.  What gives you that impression?  She sticks stuff in her ass.  You ever have somebody at least, like, if some guy's having sex with you, kind of missionary style, you ever have them kind of grab an ass cheek and maybe your finger kind of goes in there and that feels good? 
[04:14:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if it was inadvertent or not, though.  No, everything, believe me, is adverting.  Right, right.  Let me tell you something, her honesty is fucking eternal.  When a guy is feeling your ass and he slips and feels your asshole, it is more calculated than the moon landing.  Right.  That is some fucking shit that he knows.  Especially when he buries his head in your ear and goes, take it, you bitch. 
[04:15:00]  What did you say?  I said I'm sorry.  If you think you like that, wait till you get a load of this.  Yeah, that's testing the waters right there.  That's what it is.  That's Chuck Yeager, your finger.  Chuck Yeager.  You got to see if this shit's going to fly.  Chuck Yeager.  Right, right.  And we had a mission.  Yeah.  And so when he did it, you, what?  You just went, hour.  No, it didn't hurt.  It didn't go that far in it.  What did you say?  Just a little tickle?  Yeah, it was more like a ticklish sensation.  Gave you a little, ooh, kind of a tickle?  Exactly.  It tickled. 
[04:15:30]  The thing is, if a guy's going down on you and stuff, he'll maybe flip you over, get you up on your knees a little bit,  and be able to give you a little tongue.  So that'll give you a little inclination of what it feels like having something in there.  Yeah.  And, you know.  Like this.  The whole undercarriage has to be taken care of.  Just a little bit.  Like when you go to the car wash.  Jesus, Bobby.  He's got his rapist kiss mastered over there.  Every rapist goes in with a kiss like that.  What's the hair situation like? 
[04:16:00]  Like, you got a little, do you trim it or do you just let it grow?  Well, it depends.  As of right now, I've been with someone for a while.  So it's just that?  It's, but even when it's out, it's not very.  Yeah, because you're Asian.  Asians don't have a lot of hair down there.  Yeah, definitely no asshole hair.  Right.  How's your ass?  No asshole hair?  Very clean.  Turn around.  No, turn around and like bend over and let DL see.  You don't have ass.  Thanks, man.  Well, DL see.  Thanks, man.  Oh, I mean, thanks.  Let me see.  DL has given us some great radios.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[04:16:30]  No, you got to bend over, though.  Hey, Rob.  Oh, my goodness.  Rob, you're making me homesick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'll never look at little Kitty the same way again.  You can't see it with the pink thing over it.  Yeah, lift up the pink thing a little bit.  Bobby, hold her microphone for a little bit.  Be a gentleman.  Just turn that way.  All right, good.  Just turn that way.  I'm just going to see what that's going to look like.  Turn that way.  No, turn that way.  Turn towards them.  That's for DL.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Can you pull that down a little bit?  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Wait, a little higher with it.  Just bend down a little bit more.  You want to see some bare back, I guess. 
[04:17:00]  A little lower back.  You got any tats?  No, I don't.  You don't?  Do you want some?  Piercings?  I probably want, like, a star cascade.  Mushroom tats?  I can take care of the cascade part.  Cascade of Hawaii.  I can try to make a star to a cascade down to the back of your knee.  Wow.  You're open and beautiful and refreshing.  Yeah.  She's pretty honest there.  That's what makes her sexy, too, is how honest she is.  And her face, and her ass, and her tits, and everything else. 
[04:17:30]  Right.  And her hair.  And I like you for your mind, but the shit that's wrapped in it ain't all that bad either.  I'm just saying.  Aw, thank you.  Hey, Lily, you're not going to be working for Ron and Fez today.  We have a special assignment for you.  Oh, no.  Ron and Fez will understand.  We need you to sneak into a massage parlor and jerk David off.  Speaking of which, those guys are in a cab.  Let's check in with them for a second.  Okay, Lily, stay right there.  Sam.  Yeah.  All right, we got Sam in a cab, DL, so this might be happening.  So what's going on, Sam? 
[04:18:00]  We're in a cab right now.  This is definitely happening.  Really?  All right.  Is he motivated now?  Yeah, he's ready to do this.  Okay.  Are you guys getting close?  No, it took us a minute to get a cab.  We're a little while away.  You know, they just don't pick Jews up, those cabs.  I hate them.  That proves that you might be black there, Sam.  How far is the cab?  Yeah, it was the hair.  How the hair did it.  Try to wear a hat next time.  Try to thread.  Well, it's all Pakistanis.  Do you think we're going to pick David up?  Good point. 
[04:18:30]  What has David been saying in the cab, Sam?  Anything?  He said, are we really going to go?  Are we really going to go?  And I said, yes, we're going now.  Yes, we are going.  How far are you guys away?  We just got in the cab right before I called you.  Okay.  He's acting like a child going to Six Flags.  This is it.  He's so excited.  This is Six Flags.  Are we really going?  Are we really doing this?  That'd be funny if they actually did switch over to legit, and he's down there.  He's just like, no, no, no.  Jerk me off.  You got to jerk my cock. 
[04:19:00]  Then he starts going, motherfucker, jerk my cock off.  He likes the DL laying down some DL on his fucking ass.  You just take him out and rest him.  Then I'm justifying.  Your Honor, when I said that, I didn't really mean it.  Did you supply the funding for this?  Some kind of way, I get into it.  Yeah, you're fucked somehow.  Right, right, right, right.  Somehow, DL, then fuck you.  Just to let everybody know, I really gave him the number.  Would you write me?  I would not write.  You wouldn't write me?  What does that mean?  I mean, it's like if it turns bad and I'm indicted behind some sexual scandal. 
[04:19:30]  Write him if he's in jail.  I like you much better than I like intern David.  Oh, shit.  Would you write him in jail?  Would you come see me?  Like, right?  Oh, I didn't know.  No, right.  No, right.  They have a problem with their R's.  All have a problem with their R's.  Fuck is wrong.  We got to give...  More stereotyping.  We got to give Ron and Fez one of our guys because Lily's not working today.  This is hysterical.  Who can work for Ron and Fez today?  Because Lily's... 
[04:20:00]  What do you do for them?  I...  Oh, thank you, Ron.  Did you say nothing?  I intern for them, so that means everything.  She does a lot on air, too.  She's on air a lot.  How come they're fucking...  Ron and Fez just really, when it comes to picking interns, are fucking unbelievable.  Lily, now her, and you've got a 38-year-old me.  Let me tell you something.  You're right.  38-year-old guy and a Jewish intern that's never left his house.  Ron and Fez have a way of, like, they endear themselves to their audience, to the interns, 
[04:20:30]  to this, and even though the fact that, I'll be honest, Ronnie doesn't seem like the easiest  guy to deal with on a certain basis, on certain times.  It's actually Ron Bennington that attracted me to the Ron and Fez show.  Of course, Ronnie's a genius.  I love Ronnie.  He's very sexy.  But Ronnie, but if you're a guy walking around, Ronnie will give you shit if you're fucking  up.  That's right.  That's true.  So, but, but he uses that control with compassion, unlike some other people.  Wow, what do you got?  What are you going to do?  Opie is like Stalin.  Yeah, what are you going to do? 
[04:21:00]  It's worked for us for a while.  Could you imagine her here every fucking day?  That's why we don't have female interns.  Why?  We don't want to be distracted.  We'd be fucking them.  Whether they like it or not.  Today is Rape the Intern Day.  Yay!  Jimmy wins again.  Lily, by the way, Ron and Fez noon to three.  Oh, shit.  Ron and Fez noon to three.  That's tough.  God damn, you forgot to give the plug, Ben.  I'm going to like that.  Sam.  You know, aren't they on the air in like six minutes? 
[04:21:30]  Six minutes?  Ah, whatever.  Sam.  Whatever.  Whatever.  What are you, so, all right, any final thoughts there?  We're going down Ninth Avenue.  This is going to be the experience of a lifetime for all of us.  And you're taping some audio?  Yeah, we're going to have audio.  All right, we'll have that on Monday.  Yeah.  What a nice tease.  I got to call and see how this works.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Call.  You live in New York.  You come back in on Monday.  Hey, I got to be in L.A.  What a humanitarian, though, that was.  That was a great move.  That's probably the coolest thing ever. 
[04:22:00]  You saw it.  Like Johnny Applecy.  The guy was in need.  Yeah.  And hey, it's Opie from Opie and Anthony, and that does it for us.  We're done.  Go find someone else to entertain you.  Yeah, we're done.  Ron and Fez.  Yeah, they're up next.  All right.  Hooray!  On the Virus XM202, Sirius 197. </pre>
