<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts recounting their debaucherous Halloween weekend party. Opie detailed the heavy drinking, karaoke, and numerous attendees, including Sam Roberts (who missed due to a snowstorm), Janine (in a Twilight Zone nurse costume), Big A and Mike (as the Honeymooners), and Chip Scott (as a UFC fighter).  Pictures of the partygoers in their costumes were shown, leading to humorous commentary on their appearances and physical attributes. Opie then criticized the documentary *Winnebago Man*, segued into discussing the premiere of *The Innkeepers* (where he met Amy Schumer and director Ty West, a show fan), and finally turned to his observations of Occupy Wall Street. He described a shift in the protest demographics towards more aggressive and potentially violent individuals, witnessing a violent confrontation firsthand. Opie anticipated the occupation's violent end due to harsh weather or escalating violence after the city removed heaters and generators from the protest site.

The discussion shifted to a continued critique of Occupy Wall Street, Michael Moore (referred to as a "phony" and a "fat fuck"), and the US healthcare system. The hosts highlighted the perceived inequality between the healthcare of politicians and veterans, a point amplified by a veteran caller detailing his struggles with post-service healthcare access.  The segment featured an old (circa 1997) audio clip of the hosts engaging in "hacky" on-air banter about urinating in the shower, initially presented as off-air conversation before being revealed as a deliberate broadcast.  Nicole, a guest dressed as a whoopee cushion due to a lost bet, briefly appeared. Comedian Bill Burr joined later, commenting on the old clip and the challenges of connecting with younger audiences. The segment included a comedic "Monster Mash" rendition and a Stephen Lynch song, alongside promotions for upcoming live events.

Next, a "You might be a child of the 80s if…" bit ensued, with Opie, Anthony, and producer Sam engaging in a profane and often contradictory debate about their 80s childhoods.  This involved playing audio and video clips, revealing inconsistencies and exaggerated claims about drug use.  Jokes about a “Mr. Herman” phone call, the "Where's the Beef?" commercial, and analysis of their past appearances were interspersed with listener calls adding to the absurdity.  80s pop culture references, including Weird Al Yankovic, *The Brady Bunch* movie, *Tron*, *Miami Vice*, and Def Leppard, peppered the conversation.

This "child of the 80s" theme continued, with further embellishment and revelation of fabricated childhood stories, including prank calls and ladder stunts.  The hosts’ attempts to cover up their lies, blaming technical difficulties, added to the comedic effect. Bill Burr returned to the studio, followed by Tony Iommi. The conversation transitioned to Iommi's autobiography, his early career with Black Sabbath, and the factory accident that injured his fingers. He detailed his creative adaptations to continue playing guitar, his multiple marriages, the band's volatile dynamic, the creation of "Paranoid," and the future of Black Sabbath.  The interview included anecdotes about John Bonham (including a verbal altercation with Ronnie James Dio, where Dio called Bonham a "fucking cunt"), a violent altercation with skinheads defended by Ozzy Osbourne using a hammer,  Iommi's car accident where he claimed to see angelic figures, and near-fatal incidents involving Bill Ward and a bar fight resulting in a gunshot wound.  The segment concluded with plugs for Iommi's book and upcoming signings, alongside mentions of other musicians like Jethro Tull, The Rolling Stones, John Lennon, Chuck Berry, and a humorous anecdote about Yoko Ono interrupting a performance.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used humorous and often crude language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh, really? Hold on, let me put my mic back together.  Morning, everybody!  Good morning, good morning.  Last day of October, huh?  Alright, Halloween, as a matter of fact.  Is today Halloween?  It is, yes it is.  Man!  All Hallows-eans, man!  What does that even mean? Yes, it's Halloween.  Well, most people did their Halloween over the weekend, right? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, at parties and stuff like that.  It's kind of rough on a Monday to have a Halloween party.  So people did it, I guess, Saturday and Sunday?  You did, sir.  I did my Saturday night party. That was fun.  I thought you would have a snow out.  More drunken in an archery.  No, there was a few people couldn't make it because of the snow.  Sam Roberts.  Aww.  Sam was a...  What's that in Westchester?  I wasn't...  That bad, was it?  Westchester had a lot of snow. 
[00:01:00]  We got hit.  Yeah.  It was just...  It was one of those things where I guess the snow was pretty light in some areas, pretty  heavy in others, and I was in a light zone, so I wasn't able to really look around and  take your excuse realistically to heart.  I didn't realize you cared so much about young Sam.  I don't.  I bring the party.  The party was great.  He brings the party.  He does bring the party.  I bring the party.  No, it was fun.  I had a good time.  A bunch of people came over.  They were able to make it. 
[00:01:30]  Wow.  You really wanted Sam there.  No issues at all.  Actually, I just wanted Jess there.  Wow.  What the hell?  We were both in Westchester.  Yeah?  Best Chester.  Well, not over the weekend.  It was bad snow Chester.  Oh, really?  That really rolls off the tongue.  You like that Chester?  That's good.  Yeah, so it was fun.  You're the basic debauchery.  My throat is still, I'm still a little gravelly.  You do the...  A lot of karaokeing and shots. 
[00:02:00]  Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.  How's that go again?  Shot.  No?  Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.  Yeah.  Did Kenny get you with his Halloween joke yet?  I don't think he did.  No.  It's a terrific one, and I finally learned over the years that you think you're special when Kenny says something to you,  and then you realize he says the exact same thing to every person he sees.  Look at Mars, nodding.  I get into his truck this morning, and he goes,  I see you're wearing your Halloween costume. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, no.  But he can't.  My left cheek wasn't even on the seat.  He couldn't wait to use his line.  He had to.  He didn't wait for me to close the door.  As soon as he's heard the click of the door,  I see that you're wearing your Halloween costume today.  See, what I'm implying is you look silly or something, or scary.  Thinking Kenny is giving you a thought that's, like, just unique.  Yeah, it's like dialing the wrong number and expecting the operator to say something different than the number you have reached. 
[00:03:00]  How many people have gotten the Halloween line so far?  I got it.  Mars got it, see?  See?  You would think it would be an off-the-cuff thing, but you know he thought about that coming into the city,  and he just can't wait to use it a lot.  How can I bring everyone's spirits up today?  With a joke.  That's it from the party?  I thought you would have some cool stories, man.  Nah, it's like... 
[00:03:30]  No one jumped in the pool?  No, no, the pool was very cold.  I looked out the window, I was debating it.  It was steaming a little bit, but it was because it was just a little warmer than outside, but no, that was like 55 degree water.  It was mostly, not mostly, it was a total indoor kind of a party.  Some people are milling about, showing up, and I'm like, who is this?  Oh boy.  Who is this?  Oh boy.  Not bad.  Not like the last party where there were a lot of people, I was like, who the fuck is this? 
[00:04:00]  But a couple of people, I was just like, I don't really know who that is.  But everyone was cool.  Everyone had fun.  And, yeah, nothing really, nothing really big.  It's kind of a, you had to be there kind of a thing.  God, I was hoping we would kill an hour on the Halloween party.  No, no, no.  That's, as, I guess as memories of it start funneling back into my mind, perhaps I'll be able to give you a little more information.  Was it a big party there, Jimmy? 
[00:04:30]  I literally...  Was the booze a-flowing?  But that's any time.  Yeah.  I did, I went, I did two sets and then I went out.  I only stayed for a little while.  I stayed for probably two hours max.  Yeah.  Because I wanted to get home and finish reading Tony Iommi's book.  Ah, yes, he's into it.  I went home to read.  I saw your tweet about the Long Island Expressway.  Oh, yeah, it was bad for a few minutes.  But the problem was it wasn't as bad as I thought because it was a spill on the highway.  So it was a debris spill so I couldn't get mad.  That's why I gave up on Long Island. 
[00:05:00]  I can't live out there anymore because you can't get there.  It is very infuriating.  That Long Island Expressway is a fucking nightmare.  Driving around.  My costume was great.  I didn't wear a costume, but Chip did.  But it was good.  What was your costume?  It was...  Did he have a costume?  Yeah, Chip did.  Chip said he had a costume.  Yeah, he did.  What was the costume?  I'll show it to you.  It's good.  Oh, my God.  Did you have a costume?  I just went as kind of an Islamic revolutionary or me on any Tuesday. 
[00:05:30]  So you kind of just threw it together a little bit?  Yeah, just kind of fucking put some shit on me.  You usually go all out for Halloween.  Yeah, I couldn't really figure out what I wanted to do.  So I was just like, screw it.  Everybody else came dressed up.  So, you know, that was a success.  Very good.  Janine did a great job.  She showed up as one of the nurses from the Twilight Zone in that episode where the girl was getting face surgery and her face was in bandages. 
[00:06:00]  And they didn't show the face to anyone else in the whole episode.  Right.  And there were doctors and nurses.  She was in the hospital.  And then they take the bandages off the girl to see if the surgery worked and made her pretty.  And as they take it off, the doctors go, oh, my God, it didn't work.  Oh, no.  And they show the girl, and she's hot.  Yeah.  And then they finally, you know, move the camera up so you see the nurses and doctors.  And they all are ugly.  They all got, like, those weird, twisty, Twilight Zone-y faces.  Yeah.  I know that episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Janine went as one of those weird face people. 
[00:06:30]  So besides you, who else knew that?  I know.  That's the problem.  There were, like, three people that were like, wow, that is the best costume.  And everyone else was like, what are you supposed to be?  That's amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to see the picture now.  That's, um, who the hell is that?  What is that?  That's Newsday Laura.  Oh, Newsday Laura.  I'm sorry.  Can you flip through the picture?  Yeah.  Painted her eyelids.  Yeah, no, that's what.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That's what got me all fucked up.  Yeah, when she shut her eyes, it looks like she's got giant eyeballs. 
[00:07:00]  Nice.  Big A snapped the picture.  Big A.  Big A and Mike were dressed as the honeymooners, a man from space.  And when Norton came running in, in his sewer gear as the man from space.  Steve from Bayshore was there.  Yeah, there was, uh, there were a lot of people, actually, that came dressed up.  Very cool.  It was pretty cool.  God damn.  I thought Big A twittered my costume.  It's horrible.  That's me dressed, uh, that's somebody dressed as me from the 80s with a couple of lovely 
[00:07:30]  young ladies that, uh, came by.  Somebody dressed as me.  With them.  Somebody.  What do I know?  I don't, I don't, I don't give out names.  I don't want to blow up anyone's spot, you know?  Ah, all right.  But he's got the Apollo air conditioning.  He couldn't get a big enough wig.  Big A is horrible at labeling pictures.  Yeah.  You could just stop at Big A's horrible.  Exactly.  He's horrible at a lot of things.  Big A was there.  Where's the picture he had?  He took a picture of Chip's Hauling costume.  It was a good one.  Yeah, Sam, you could just go.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, there it is.  What are you?  Can you go all the way to the show of the hands? 
[00:08:00]  What are you doing?  See?  That's.  What is he?  See, that's me.  That's a UFC fighter after he wakes up.  Because he got the eye thing on his head.  He's got the eye things on his head that you sleep with so the sun doesn't bother you.  And he's got a boxing glove on.  A UFC glove.  A UFC glove on.  And a hoodie.  And it says UFC fighter when he wakes up.  Yeah.  That was Chip Scott.  That's Chuck Loodle after he gets a nice nap on a plane or something.  How long was he, Chip, for the party?  Like, all of it. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much all of it.  I can't help it anymore.  It just happens.  Oh, see, that's the Twilight Zone-y.  That's cool.  Like, nurse-y look.  Wow, that is very cool.  Heather Hyde had a good costume, too.  She was Lacey Peterson.  Yeah, Lacey Peterson.  It was really, really a good costume.  She came with Connor.  Yeah.  It was a couple, Connor and Lacey.  She was pregnant with chains on her and seaweed.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, my God.  It was Connor and Lacey Peterson.  That's way too much effort.  That was great. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Very good.  It was fun to see Lacey Peterson karaoke-ing away with not a care that young Connor was,  you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, you had some good costumes.  Yeah, it was cool.  Costumes.  Costumes.  Costumes.  You're very welcome, Chip.  And, oh, there you go.  Girls were a big hit.  They were singing and karaoke and dancing.  It was great.  Do you know those girls?  Nope. 
[00:09:30]  You didn't know them?  Nope.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Wow.  Yeah.  You've got to be checking IDs at the door, sir.  You think?  Yeah.  Should I really?  You might.  You might want to.  I don't know.  I like that element of surprise where you're kind of not sure who's going to pop in, what's  going to happen.  It's kind of cool.  But they can rob you blind.  No, no, no.  No.  I got it. 
[00:10:00]  You got it.  I'm on it.  Yeah, there's not much of a problem there.  All right.  Very good.  Let me see.  What?  It's kind of funny.  Just some pictures from.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You know, party pictures.  Oh, wow.  It's fun.  Wait, can I see yours? 
[00:10:30]  That's hilarious.  Let me see.  Jesus.  That's a nice ass, right?  Nice ass.  That's hilarious.  That's a deep crack.  That's hilarious.  I love a deep crack.  Jimmy loves the deep crack.  I really do.  Oh, God.  I love a good fucking deep ass cheeks.  Yeah, it was fun.  Definitely.  Sounds like I had a great time.  Who's that?  That's Patrick.  Just a Satan.  Fuck.  Yeah, that was good.  Gotta have a Satan at your Halloween party. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And all I know is there was a lot of glasses on the bar on a Sunday morning.  Just a lot of glasses.  What time did you finally crash?  Debris.  I think I finally went to bed at maybe 9 a.m.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  9 a.m. Sunday.  Yeah, yeah.  Last one awake?  Well, I have no idea.  I guess.  There were people like, I went downstairs at one point. 
[00:11:30]  My brother was on the floor asleep.  And then there's bedrooms.  There's a lot of bedrooms.  I was going to say, is there a bed for your brother?  He just was like, I don't give a shit.  Plop.  Fell asleep there.  And then there's other bedrooms, so I'm not quite sure when I went to bed who was still there.  Yeah.  I just know when I wake up at some point on Sunday, which I think was like 5.30 or 6 p.m.  P.m.  On Sunday, I woke up.  And then I look out from my bedroom.  I'm able to see the driveway and the street and see if any cars are there. 
[00:12:00]  And I realize, all right, it's cool.  No one's here.  So I guess party's over.  That's how my party ends.  Party was declared over at 5.30 or 6 p.m.  P.m.  On Sunday.  That's when I officially called it.  You called it.  Yeah, I called it.  Wow.  You do any live from the compound?  No, not this weekend.  You should have compounded this shit.  I was thinking about it, but it gets too crazy.  And there's this shit that maybe you don't want out there.  You know?  Right.  Like, it's people's privacy at a party. 
[00:12:30]  They don't have the feeling that they're...  You have it in the one room, and if people want to come in, they come in.  That's true.  I could do that.  You put a big fucking sign, like, look, man.  If you want to be shown, then stay away from this area.  I could do that.  We got Secret Show from the Future 2.  What's that?  This Saturday.  This coming Saturday.  Very good.  From the compound.  But other than that, you know, like I said, you want to keep it kind of nice.  On the DL.  On the DL, as they say.  Some people might say something horrible.  And I've been known to put down a few and maybe blurt out a racial epithet or two. 
[00:13:00]  So, you know, I don't want that out there.  No, no, no, no.  I've never done that here.  Well, I do try to do it during commercial break.  Yeah.  I guess a success.  Sounds like it.  Yeah.  I did.  I was contemplating firing up the jacuzzi, too.  I think at one point I did.  Wow.  But it was taking a lot – it was taking much too long to really heat up.  I finally got the bounce right.  You should fire that up early in the morning. 
[00:13:30]  But, well, I – it wasn't that early.  It was kind of late-ish early.  No, I'm saying you should have.  I know.  I know.  I should have done that a little earlier.  I should have done that a little earlier.  I should have done that for you.  I should have done that a little earlier, but –  Mm-hmm.  Eh.  There you go, though.  Oh, yeah.  God, I – instead of going to your party, I watched Winnebago Man.  What?  Who's in that?  Is that Rob Williams?  What?  No, it's the Winnebago guy.  Oh.  Oh, you saw it, Iraq?  Yeah, I saw that a long time ago. 
[00:14:00]  It was all right.  Winnebago Man is the famous fucking viral video of the guy, the outtakes of him trying  to sell the Winnebago, and then some young filmmaker decided he needs to do a documentary  on the guy.  Did we watch that with Ace Frehley?  I'm not sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Did we?  We watched that with somebody.  We watched clips of that.  Oh, yeah, we did.  We did.  Somebody actually brought it to our attention, didn't they?  Yeah.  This guy.  The Winnebago Concepts and Engineering Department.  This guy.  He developed a multifunctional bathroom.  Privacy.  I don't even know what the fuck I'm reading. 
[00:14:30]  I wonder what the fuck the real dialogue is.  What the fuck is this thing?  All of the windshields, for fuck's sake.  Oh, fuck.  What?  What the fuck did I say?  That didn't sound for shit, did it?  Trying to give these guys everything they can get to me.  That's it.  Fuck it.  I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.  We suppose we open...  Gotta do it again, right now.  Oh, I live, but... 
[00:15:00]  Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Shit.  Tony, do me a favor.  Will you please?  Will you?  Will you do me kindness?  Please.  Yeah.  I think I want to be walking in and out if you're going to fuck up when I've got to come  back.  I don't make any difference to me at this juncture.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that, Tony.  Don't slam the fucking door.  No more.  Yeah, so...  That's great. 
[00:15:30]  It's like a four-minute clip.  The movie sucked.  Oh, did it?  Did they interview the guy?  My point is my night was very different than yours.  That's all I was trying to get at.  Yeah.  E-Rock, the movie sucked.  You were the one who told me I should see this damn thing.  Yeah, well, when they finally find the guy, he's like living out in the middle of nowhere.  He has his name removed from every form of ID that the government has.  He's just totally...  He cut off the rest of the world.  And they find this guy, and he's still just as fucking miserable as he was in this commercial. 
[00:16:00]  And it's been like 20, 30 years later.  He has no family, no friends, no nothing.  And he's still just fucking miserable.  It's about 20 years later, and he's like an old man now.  He's 78 or something like that.  And he's a loner in the mountains of California.  Really?  And it's a documentary, and you don't learn anything about the guy.  I want to learn something about you if you're in a documentary.  Yeah.  And so, you know, Jim was right. 
[00:16:30]  We watched this.  Ace Frehley brought this to our attention.  This is one of his favorite things on YouTube to watch.  Oh, really?  And in exchange, we introduced him to Two Girls, One Cup.  Oh, okay.  So I remember we showed him Two Girls, One Cup.  I think we gave him something better.  Of course we did.  How often can you be hungry and jerk off?  Whatever.  But I don't know.  People were talking about this documentary on Winnebago, man.  It was poorly done.  Really?  To be honest with you. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, and if they didn't have the outtakes from the original viral video,  it would have been nonsense.  Friday I saw a movie.  I actually went to a little New York movie premiere at the Lincoln Center.  Wow, look at you.  The Lincoln Center.  It's The Innkeepers, a horror movie.  I hear good things about this.  Yeah, Ty West, who is the director and a fucking huge fan of the show.  Really?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Huge fan of the show.  And just a really funny fucking guy, too.  He did a Q&A afterwards.  It was hilarious.  Why don't we get him in?  We're going to.  Oh, good.  I guess the movie's coming out in December.  Okay.  This is like the New York premiere.  But he's really good.  The whole thing, like, it doesn't start with, like, an axe in the head.  And you're like, okay, this thing.  There's, like, really good characters.  The acting's great. 
[00:18:00]  And it was just a fun but fucking scary as shit, too.  And it's got, like, that great build-up and then climax thing.  Really good.  He did a great job.  And I was very excited.  He goes, because he's been a fan for years.  In the advertisement.  Right.  He's been a fan for years of the show.  And he goes, you see, I kind of ripped off one of your lines.  And I was like, when that fucking got said by one of the characters of the movie, I was 
[00:18:30]  kind of like, wait a minute.  I fucking say that.  The guy behind the desk.  One of these nerdy guys behind the desk.  Did you scream the N-Berm?  Yes.  I said N-Berm.  I was going to say word or bah-Berm.  The N-Berm.  You're tired.  I didn't go close to the word or bah-Berm.  That's hilarious.  The N-Berm.  The guy behind the desk at one point, the girl comments that he knows, you know, he was  very smart about what he did and how does he know something like that.  And he just goes, he goes, I know a little bit about a lot of things. 
[00:19:00]  It's like, I've been saying that for years with the whole Professor Anthony thing.  But, yeah, he goes, yeah, I threw that one.  Very cool.  That was cool.  But he's really, he's really good.  And when he did the Q&A, like, you know, when you usually see these director types, you  know, sitting there and spouting off of this pompous bullshit, he was hilarious, really  funny and sarcastic.  And Amy Schumer was there.  It was weird.  It was sort of like a two worlds meeting thing because I didn't expect to see her there.  She shows up talking for a little while. 
[00:19:30]  She goes, yeah, I'm here with my priest.  And I'm laughing.  And then she sits down with a priest.  And then I just start thinking, it's got to be for Halloween.  Sure.  But she's not dressed up as anything.  But she's with a guy that's dressed like a priest.  Maybe he was going to a party after the premiere.  Maybe.  It was just an odd thing.  Because I was like, ha ha.  Because, you know, who would take a priest to a horror movie?  I thought it was a joke.  And then she sits down with a priest.  Well, why don't you ask her if it's a real priest or not?  What's wrong with you?  I figured I'd just let it go. 
[00:20:00]  By the way.  She loved it, though, too.  Leave Amy Schumer alone.  Jesus Christ.  She asked us if it's okay to go on Howard.  What?  That bitch!  And first of all, none of these guys have to ask to do another show ever.  We don't play that game.  Others I've heard do play that game.  We don't play that game.  It was nice that she asked us whatever.  But of course she should go on Howard Stern.  It's not an issue.  She's ready to blow up.  Of course.  So just leave her alone.  We don't do that here.  Like, don't do that show.  Do any show you've got to promote on. 
[00:20:30]  Good for her, man.  You know?  That's fucking great.  We know who our friends are in the end.  So whatever.  We like when these guys get...  And Amy, now not one.  Yeah.  Boom.  Boom.  Boomer.  Amy.  Boomer.  I saw it at the cellar.  And she's like, yeah, I'm doing Howard.  But I talked to Greg.  She called you Greg.  I'm like, yeah.  Of course.  But it was just nice of her to say that.  They don't have to ask.  It was nice of her to say that.  I love the listeners that, you know, they're so rabid that they get a hold of me.  That's what I heard. 
[00:21:00]  Amy Coopin's of your Howard.  Fuck that bitch.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  I'm like, just leave her alone.  It's cool.  Leave her alone.  She's finally going to blow up.  Yeah.  Let her have her time, man.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  If she's funnier, though, there than she is here, then there's a problem.  Or if she shows her tits on Howard or reveals something.  Oh, then we're going to have a problem.  Or reveals something.  Like, you know, I jerked off President Obama.  What?  What?  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  Then we're going to have a problem.  Yeah.  Shit.  So the movie was good? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Really, really good.  I see on Rotten Tomatoes it's doing very, very well.  Yeah.  And we'll have the guy in soon, right?  Yep.  I have him in.  And he's bringing in the lead actress, who's like, she was really cute in the movie and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And apparently she's kind of funny, too.  Is it a horror movie?  Yeah.  It's a horror movie.  Is there a little comedy in there?  When he was doing his last movie, he stayed in this hotel in Connecticut.  And he said a lot of creepy shit was just happening around the hotel. 
[00:22:00]  It's, you know, whether it's just that it was an old hotel and, you know, it's drafty and doors kind of move around.  He goes, everyone from the crew had kind of a story about how creepy the fucking hotel was.  Right.  So when he got this story that he wrote this story about a haunted hotel, he was like, just film it at the hotel that they stayed at while they were filming a previous movie.  And that's what he did.  Wow.  And, yeah, really good.  Really creepy, eerie, but also funny.  Like, you know, not slapstick funny. 
[00:22:30]  Fucking clever writing.  And just good characters.  It was called The Innkeeper?  Yeah, The Innkeepers.  Keepers.  Innkeepers.  The Innkeepers.  Very good.  It's, yeah, really good.  And Ty's a fucking pisser.  I can't wait to have him in.  Nice.  How old is he?  He's a young guy.  Fucking, yeah, just a fucking young guy.  That means he was listening to us when he was 14 or something.  Oh, I know.  It must have been, like, just a fucking kid.  I hate the ones that come up to me and they go, hey, I used to listen to you when I was, you know, in high school.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  How old are you now?  32.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  And Roller Girl was there from Boogie Nights, of course.  Yeah?  Yes, Heather.  Heather Graham was there.  And as was Natasha Lyonne.  Mm-hmm.  So her there from...  She's looking good these days.  Natasha Lyonne?  Yeah.  Eh, a little...  Well, she was...  She's always a little...  She's always been a little hefty.  Like, a little thicker than the other apple pie girls. 
[00:23:30]  But, yeah, she looks clean.  She looked good.  Because she had...  I always thought she was cute, you know.  She's kind of got a cute, weird, cute thing going.  Does she look like any of those pictures?  Let me think.  No, she looks better than that.  All right.  Yeah, that must have been...  She used to be real fucking cute.  She actually, yeah, popping up her mug shot or something.  Yeah, that's a mug shot.  Yeah, that's kind of cute.  No, you got...  That's pixie-ish. 
[00:24:00]  But she looked like that?  No, not at all.  There's a drop-off from that picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A drop-off from that one.  I don't like that hair like that, though.  That's too...  No, that was very 80s looking.  Yeah.  You know, shit like that.  Oh, boy, that's a...  Did she look like that?  No.  She looks more like she used to than that picture would imply.  Some girls are just better on drugs, I'm thinking.  Oh, Jesus.  Is she like that?  No.  No, no.  But don't you think? 
[00:24:30]  Some girls should just stay on the drugs.  Yeah.  Does she look like that?  No, no.  So where is she?  I don't know.  There's a weird...  In between that?  I think there's a weird time now where there aren't a lot of photos of what she looks like  right now.  Is she...  No.  Better or worse than that?  Better.  She looks better...  She looks better than her bad pictures, but not as good as her good pictures.  Can you still tell she has nice eyes?  Yeah.  She's got those big peepers.  What about like that? 
[00:25:00]  All right.  You missed it.  All right.  Did you say hi to her?  No, but it's weird.  I keep bumping into her at things.  Like, I keep seeing her and she looks at me and we kind of look at each other just long  enough for it to be a little weird.  Right.  And then look away and don't say anything.  She might have a crush on you.  But I...  No, I think we...  I think she knows, like...  She might probably think I'm stalking her or something.  Because we just keep popping up.  Like, I saw her at the...  I saw her at the Radiohead show, too. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, she was there?  Yeah.  And again, it was the same thing.  It's kind of...  We looked at each other and she...  Right.  And she looks and then it's just a little too long.  I only saw Scarlett Johansson and Reynolds there, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Ryan Reynolds.  Wait.  And who are you talking about?  Natasha Lyonne.  I don't know who she is.  She was in the American Pie movies.  And then she had some problems with drugs.  She had some drug problems.  She was a real mess for a while.  But I think she got over those.  Well, is she fat?  No, her ass is a little bigger than you would like it to be. 
[00:26:00]  That means she's probably back on the weed.  But I think she's sitting around with the munchies.  She might be heading backwards.  With the munchies.  Backwards.  See, I don't like...  See, when she's trying to...  Yeah, no.  When she's trying to glam up, it doesn't look good at all.  She was very just dressed down and...  Just looks sloppy.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, she used to be fucking hot, man.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Who is that? 
[00:26:30]  Exactly.  Furlong.  Yeah, Furlong.  Eddie Furlong, right?  Edward Furlong.  Who's he in?  That's right.  He wanted to be called Edward.  Yeah.  Terminator.  Terminator.  American History X.  Was he...  Oh, the brother.  In the Terminator, was he the kid?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  In Terminator 2.  Right.  Let's say T2.  He was incredibly famous for a while, and now he just dropped off the map with that  guy, Edward Furlong.  He's on the convention circuit.  He is.  Oh, wow.  He does a lot of conventions.  Oh, that's not fucking good at all.  Not good at all.  Jimmy, your Cowboys did terrific last week.  Ooh. 
[00:27:00]  I saw a little football in the gymnasium, but not the Cowboys.  I was watching the Redskins lose.  Dude, the Bills are for real this year.  Yeah.  Shutting out the fucking Redskins.  And who else was losing?  I was watching New England losing to Pittsburgh.  Steelers said, fuck you.  This is what we do now.  They beat up Brady nicely and the Pats.  Apparently, kept the ball out of his hands.  That's right.  That's what it was.  Kept possession a little, I guess twice the possession time of the pleasure. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Brady didn't have one of his better games.  Sacked three times.  A key fumble.  My Jets sat it out, so I watched the Bills.  Yeah.  Dumb Bills.  Yeah.  And the Jets had a, oh, what do they call a Baha'u?  Had the Bills there.  I said.  They shut out the Skins.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, they did.  They're looking real fucking good.  What are they?  Five and two, I think.  Oh.  And the Colts.  Chance to blow it in the big game again, maybe? 
[00:28:00]  Huh?  Chance to blow it in the big game again?  How do you go to four consecutive Super Bowls and don't come away with one?  Because they're shitheads.  That's why that happened, because they were shitheads.  And they were trying to say, no, but they are one of the greatest teams.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  They had to win one out of the four.  One.  That's all it would have taken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know how you live with yourself.  You don't.  Well, it's almost like being, I guess.  Well, Ken Hull decided not to.  It's like being one out away, one strikeout away from winning the World Series twice and 
[00:28:30]  then losing that.  Maybe it's like that.  God.  The fucking Rangers are probably really unhappy.  Oh, my God.  That had to just fucking be devastating.  Wait, the Cardinals won the World Series since the last time we were on the air?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Friday night.  Yeah, they had that big comeback, which forced the game seven.  And then, wow.  How they fucking pulled that one out.  Poor Texas.  Poor Texas.  The Colts are still undefeated. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah?  The other way.  Oh, the other way.  Yeah, undefeated.  0-8.  They're still a perfect record.  0-8.  The Colts and the Dolphins.  Giants beat the Dolphins 20-17.  That's not that impressive to all you Giants fans out there.  Yeah.  So you've got two teams that still haven't won a game.  Who was throwing for the Colts?  Anyone know?  Not a clue.  No one knows.  No one cares.  Good point. 
[00:29:30]  Curtis Painter.  Was a painter again?  Yeah, that's what I'm getting.  That's what my intel is telling me.  Fuck, how do you even play the rest of the games if you're 0-8?  I know.  Why bother?  I just wouldn't want to get injured, you know?  At that point.  Right.  You don't want to fuck up your career for absolutely no reason.  0-8.  0-8.  0-8.  Even if they won the rest of their games, they don't make the playoffs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you continue, Travis, being 0-8?  Well... 
[00:30:00]  What does a team do?  Hope for a good draft pick?  Yeah, but wouldn't you, like, kind of rest your superstars if they even have a couple?  No, never give up.  Season's not over yet.  Right, guys?  0-8.  0-8.  Season's not over.  Right, guys?  He tries to make us all agree with him.  Right, guys?  Come on.  0-8.  Up top, up top.  8.  Yeah, Colts are 0-8.  Dolphins are 0-7.  Yeah.  Are they 0-7, the Dolphins?  Oh, yeah.  Florentine wanted him to lose.  I want him to lose every game.  Every game.  Every game.  Well, because then you get the number one draft pick. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Who cares if they win three?  So what?  They're 3-13.  What is that?  What is that?  I forgot he was a Dolphins fit.  Yeah.  He's impossible to win a football argument with.  Really?  Impossible.  He's good, huh?  I told you.  He talked about it last time he was on, but how he would fucking go through the Miami  Dolphins newsletter and track guys down.  Right.  And fucking just call and scream at them.  Because they were wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How could you say they got a good defense?  That's great. 
[00:31:00]  I would fucking howl when he would tell me these stories.  Fucking 1991.  Me and my brother Danny were fucking calling people.  His brothers are wild, right?  He's got a lot of them.  No, his brothers are pretty mellow.  Yeah, they're funny, though.  His brother Danny's doing a really weird job overseas, but they're all smart guys.  Anyone else try stand-up in that family?  No.  Because isn't he one of five, I think?  Five boys or something?  Yeah, I know he has Joe as his brother.  He has brother Joe.  He has Danny.  I might forget his sister. 
[00:31:30]  I might forget anybody.  It might just be four of them.  I could be four of them.  Give us candy or you don't give us candy.  We're here to protect you.  It's protection money that you're paying.  Protection candy.  It's a whole mafia thing going on.  It really is a mob mentality.  Stump candy.  The mob mentality on Halloween.  It's like, yeah, look, we're just coming to the door for a little candy.  If you don't want to give us any, that's fine.  But, you know, we then aren't responsible for what might happen to your house.  How about, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pay a couple of your uncles to go old. 
[00:32:00]  Walk the perimeter.  Walk the perimeter.  And tell these fuckers to beat it.  In the dark.  There's no candy at this particular house.  They get taken out by an egg.  What is that?  TP'd house.  Wow, that is a lot of TP.  TP'd.  And the lights off.  Yeah, see?  Nah, nah.  The lights are off because it's daytime.  I'll go with the giant bowl of fucking candy.  And I get the good candy.  I get the fucking...  I get, you know, your minis.  Your big, but your real shit.  You know, your sneakers.  You had good stuff.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I had good stuff.  Riley took a lot of it.  Riley took a lot of it.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  She misbehaves.  Once she figured out that was available in reaching distance.  Yeah, Travis and Lisa's daughter, fucking hilarious.  How she stayed up for the party, too.  Yeah.  She's like the only kid at the party.  She beat a lot of people.  She did.  Other people passed out already, and she's just running around the joint.  Up to like 130.  Eating candy on a sugar rush.  Well, you give a kid some sugars, they'll stay up way past the fucking drunk. 
[00:33:00]  Insane.  M-E-M's.  Kid over drunk every single time.  M-E-M's.  Every single time.  Yeah.  So I got the big bowl that I got to, you know, do that and go to the...  Yeah.  You should do what I'm going to do this year.  What are you doing?  Empty bowl outside my apartment.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  So the people that come there think that you did the honor system thing and it just ran out. 
[00:33:30]  Yep.  You are despicable and that is hilarious.  Every black kid in the building is going to get stared at by the white kids, you know, who took the candy.  Yeah, well.  That's funny.  We got here late.  Just to be a dick.  That's funny.  Just to be a dick.  I hope the second you open the door to put the empty bowl, there's a crowd of kids there.  What?  Empty bowl sign that says, you know, take some for yourself.  Take one.  Take one or whatever.  And that's it.  You're good.  Wow.  That's a good one. 
[00:34:00]  I've never heard of that one before, but leave it to you.  I don't feel like dealing with the supermarket and getting candy and all that.  So big, huge bowl with a nice sign.  Maybe one of the pumpkins I'll just put outside and make it really festive.  I live in a fucking building.  I don't want people knocking on my door.  That's true.  What is it?  For the most part, you're not getting anyone from outside the building, right?  You have to sign up to be a part of it, first of all.  What?  So I guess they check your credentials within the building.  And it's also so they don't bother other people.  Right.  So you've got to sign up so then the kids get the list of apartments they can go to. 
[00:34:30]  This is how kids have to do this in New York City.  It's so lame.  Filled out in triplicate.  My apartment building is about 50 stories.  And they take up the elevator.  So you're stuck in your apartment all day.  Oh, man.  Oh, right.  The fucking elevator.  Those creeps.  And they'll hold the elevator so those shitty kids can run.  So they're walking up the steps.  Little shitty kids.  Well, they take up the stairwells, too.  So they take up the stairwells and the elevators for the entire day.  So we started bailing a couple of years ago.  I'm just going down to Philly.  Yeah.  The whole empty bowl thing is just a joke. 
[00:35:00]  That's hilarious.  We're bailing.  We're going to Philly.  You should do that.  No, you should.  Fuck the empty bowl.  Dude, the empty bowl thing is brilliant.  Yeah, of course.  That was a good one.  Get rid of it.  You should get it.  But you should do that and then film it.  You know, film the kids coming up.  Oh, man.  But you should have a bunch of empty bowls with notes like, you know, whatever.  Make it very festive.  Just put all your empty bowls on your stoop. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  I get paranoid.  I get that feeling when you hear the doorbell ring and you don't have candy, you just kind  of hunker down like, ah.  I think you secretly enjoy it.  No.  I think you enjoy it a little bit.  Or you're hoping maybe some of the high school girls with their slut Halloween costumes come  by.  Hi.  Well, isn't that a great little costume?  What do we got here?  Do you like my costume, Mr. Furnier?  That's wonderful.  Let me get a picture of that. 
[00:36:00]  They like to dress slutty in high school.  Well, that seems to be a problem.  I know a few people, of a few people.  Wait, kids actually knock on your door and say, sir, you're out of candy?  And, sir, do you have more candy?  There's no way kids do that.  Of course they would.  No, who's going to turn around?  I would pound on that door.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Oh, shit.  Who's abroad?  That comes to the door.  Jesus Christ.  She's got, like, taps on her nipples.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And then beer cans as, like, a thong. 
[00:36:30]  She's pretty.  Wow, she's really pretty.  Do you want to say to her, if she knocked on my door, I'd grab my crotch, I'd grab my  cock, I'd go, why don't you come out of here and get a fucking treat?  Wow, that's, uh, wow, wow, wow.  Let's look at that.  Yeah, that's, um, that's something.  Yeah, a lot of the costumes are just, uh, like, slut, slut wear.  Slut wear.  Sam, you have one job today.  Yeah?  Slutty Halloween costumes.  Just keep popping them up on it.  Pop them up.  All right.  Pop for us. 
[00:37:00]  It's inspiration for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  There you go.  Little Catwoman thing.  She's got a whip.  Yeah, we got a bell because you can't, you can't leave your building.  So you're stuck in your fucking apartment way in the sky.  That's how it sucks.  I don't mind the suburban Halloween thing.  That's, you know.  I kind of miss it.  It's, and they, they pretty much keep it to daytime hours.  They do.  In my neighborhood.  Yeah, you don't get that late night fucking knock on the door.  Where are you going to get a gate around your own house?  Stone kids.  Get a fucking gate around that damn house of yours.  I don't know about that.  Why not? 
[00:37:30]  That's probably some variance I need.  I don't think you're allowed to have fences in the front.  You're not allowed to have fences in your neighborhood?  In the front yard.  Don't you own your property?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  You don't.  You really don't.  You really don't.  Hey, really fast.  Just a quick thought.  I went down to Occupy Wall Street yesterday.  Ah, how's that going?  Now, the weather, boy, took a turn for the worse for those poor, poor people.  And the fire department and the police took away their heaters.  Generators, gasoline, cans, heaters.  And I was telling you, this is how Occupy Wall Street's going to end. 
[00:38:00]  Mark my word.  It's not going to be the cold.  Mark time, Mark time, Iraq.  It's not going to be the cold weather.  So he can pull this when it happens, because I think he's right.  It's not going to be the cold weather like Ant thinks.  Someone is going to get killed at Occupy Wall Street, New York City.  Like Kreskin.  Zuccotti Park, someone is going to die.  And that's what's going to end this whole fucking thing.  I was telling Anthony, remember the, what was it, Grizzly Man?  Yeah.  Remember Grizzly Man, that weirdo who was hanging and living with the bears? 
[00:38:30]  He could pretty much, I told Ant before the show.  Timothy Treadwell.  Timothy Treadwell.  That guy could pretty much jerk off a bear and the bear is not going to maul him.  Remember?  Well, what bear would?  Yes.  I was on.  And the reason being, as much as that guy was a kook, he understood his environment.  Okay.  But the mistake he made, he decided to live, stay there longer than he usually did.  And when he stayed there longer, the cold weather came in and more vicious bears, I think the 
[00:39:00]  brown bears moved in.  Oh, well.  Who don't fucking play like the Grizzlies.  They're animals.  I mean, they're literally animals.  And they'll eat you alive like they ended up doing with this Timothy Treadwell.  And he thought that when they were diving deep for food in the water, he goes, that looks  cute, but that's because they have to go farther down to get the fish.  Which makes them hungrier.  They're hungrier.  Right.  That is what is happening at Occupy Wall Street in New York City.  The fun-loving hippies who want to smoke a little pot and maybe they believe in their  cause. 
[00:39:30]  Hold up a sign.  Some of those people are leaving and are being replaced with the scariest fucking people  I've ever seen in my life.  White guys that love throwing around the N-word because they believe their ends.  Oh, okay.  And they're yelling and screaming it to other fellow protesters.  And they have neck tattoos and they got the fucking eye tattoos.  These guys are fucking scary.  They're getting scary.  I've been down there five or six times and now that the weather's changing, the people  are changing and you're getting some hardcore, scary individuals. 
[00:40:00]  So the whole dynamic of the group is kind of mutating from this peaceful demonstration  thing to just people that see some, probably some marks in the crowd, opportunity for crime,  a little violence.  Yes.  And I, I heard a guy and I did not film it once again because I don't want to get the  shit kicked out of me.  You got to do some covert, uh, videoing. 
[00:40:30]  This one guy with the neck tattoo was in the face of another protester.  They're on the same side and basically told the guy that he would take his fucking eyeballs  and shove it into the back of his skull.  I've never been more frightened in my life.  That guy was serious?  Dude, like shaking.  He was so pissed off saying, I'll go to fucking jail for this.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But they had to calm him down and then everyone lifted up their cameras and that's when I  did lift up my camera.  And then also they're like, peace, peace. 
[00:41:00]  They start a peace chant.  Like, no, it's all peaceful here.  Yeah, yeah.  And they dragged the one guy away and they shoved them back into one of the tents.  I'm telling you, it's getting scary.  Which guy did they drag away?  The one that said, I'll shove your fucking eyeballs into the back of your skull.  Oh, boy.  I do believe that must happen in prison.  Because how do you come up with something like that?  Yeah.  Well, your eyeballs were already in your skull.  Well, to the back.  To push them to the back of your skull.  Yeah, that's got to hurt.  That's some anger.  I'd hate to have my eyes pushed in like that.  Oh, my God. 
[00:41:30]  I was just thinking about it.  I'm like, fuck.  That hurts so your head would be all sore.  Absolutely.  I filmed another video.  I've got to make some disk space on my Mac and then I'll get it up.  You don't have disk space?  No, man.  It's a nightmare.  It's not.  All you've got to do is get one of those.  The hard drive you get on the side is the ones that you can turn on and off.  Those are pretty good ones because you can watch them quickly.  Right.  750 gig one at the Mac store.  I've got to back up my shit.  Terabyte.  I've got to back up my shit.  You don't have stuff that backed up?  Some of it, yeah.  You don't lose all your videos.  I know. 
[00:42:00]  I'm a mess.  I'm all over the fucking place.  I'm a mess.  Dude, you go.  I've got to organize.  You get an airport.  I'm not good at organizing.  The Mac airport.  Yeah, but somebody else can do it.  You get a Mac airport and it will automatically back up for you.  It's so easy.  You don't have to do anything.  Just have somebody put it in.  All right.  I've got to figure this shit out because I don't want to lose my stuff.  But that's how Occupy Wall Street is going to mark my word because they already  have a sign to bring in a fellow protester for the winter.  There's signs all over the place.  Yeah.  So that's what they're thinking.  It's like, okay, if someone has an extra room in their house or their apartment, could 
[00:42:30]  you bring in a protester for the winter?  So what will happen is they'll sleep nice and warm and then spend the day in the park  all day.  Oh, take one in.  You mean?  Take one in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll take one in if she's hot.  Yeah, right?  There's a bunch of filthy guys in the park.  All the hot girls are gone.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's what would happen.  The girls aren't as hot as they were the last few times over there.  I'm telling you.  I think they're scared of getting raped at this point. 
[00:43:00]  The type of person is changing down there.  You're getting more hardcore, scary fucking people with that faraway look in their eyes,  man, that really want just a flat-out revolution.  The logic is starting to go away a little bit down there.  And I don't know how the city breaks this up.  Because as soon as they go in for the big breakup and say, you know, this is over, it's  going to get extremely ugly down there.  I think they're just waiting it out.  Hoping that the winter knocks them out?  Yeah, yeah.  Hoping the winter just eliminates the problem. 
[00:43:30]  Dude, there's tents on top of tents.  And now they've labeled the inner park with road signs.  So individual paths now have, you know, they've named.  And I wish I could tell you some of the names.  I don't understand what they're saying.  Do you think that some people are down there just to see it fall apart?  Like some people are probably just waiting for the cops to break it up so they have a  chance to riot.  There's probably some people that want to riot.  There will be some kind of situation that gets out of hand.  And not because the NYPD.  Because when they finally move in and say enough is enough, these people are not going 
[00:44:00]  to say, oh, okay.  Right.  Let me pack up my tent and get the fuck out of here.  I talked with a few cops over the weekend.  And they are loving the overtime.  Because now it's not this weird situation where it was at the beginning where no one  really knew where they stood.  Like the cops.  Should we go in there and just bash heads?  Should we be really strict as far as keeping these people in one area?  And then the protest is like, all right, do we protest? 
[00:44:30]  Do we throw things at the police?  So now it's settled down into this kind of peaceful coexistence a little.  Right.  So now the cops are loving it because they're just getting tons of overtime, costing the  city huge amounts of money.  Yeah.  There's got to be at least two dozen cops at all times down there.  At least.  And then there's more on the fringe area.  Oh, yeah.  And there's others that are waiting.  So I'm not ready to be brought in if need be.  But easily a couple dozen just there all the time.  And in general, the protesters are extremely polite to them. 
[00:45:00]  Every once in a while you get some asshole that starts yelling and screaming at the cops,  hoping that the cops are going to do something.  They just turn their backs to the guy.  And then the crowd laughs at the idiot that was trying to get something going.  So they've got to figure it out.  They're babysitting, though.  I talked to one cop.  He's like, yeah, just sit down there and fuck around on my iPhone.  Right.  The whole time.  Right.  Nothing happens.  I hope his supervisor doesn't see that.  Whoa.  Look at this, though.  Just pause it. 
[00:45:30]  Now I've officially seen it all.  Our field position was created.  What is that?  What the hell is that?  Sam probably is fucked up again.  Oh, Sam.  Sam, open ten windows.  Why don't you?  Oh, Sam.  Are you listening to the mashup?  Oh, Sam.  Some friend.  Huh?  NFL.com.  Oh, okay.  What the hell is that?  I have finally seen it all.  So I'm down there yesterday for most of the morning.  And there's now a group called Crips.  K-R-I-P-S.  Occupy Wall Street. 
[00:46:00]  It's a bunch of cripples in wheelchairs.  Oh, okay.  I still hope the fucking gang Crips beats them up for stealing their name.  Yeah, yeah, stealing their name.  Well, they explain why a K instead of a C.  That's why.  We all know why.  About three Ks.  They ship it out.  Right.  That's why.  But I still hope that the fucking Crips not only beat them up, but sue them for copyright infringement.  Be sued by a gang.  I know.  As they hit you with chains and fucking sticks.  I got a quick, like, 12-second clip of the Crips.  That'll be in the next video.  But look at this.  Now the crippled people. 
[00:46:30]  Now I've officially seen it all.  New video coming soon.  Look at the Crips.  They're in wheelchairs.  Why?  Holy shit.  Because everyone's down there with their cause.  That's what makes it confusing.  Everyone has a completely different reason for being down there.  Flusterfuck.  You should have got a chant going.  You should have started going, all right, everybody.  Nice legs, dick.  Nice legs, dick. 
[00:47:00]  Shit.  That's the problem.  They all got a different cause.  So I don't really...  I still don't understand this.  I think you're right, though.  Whether someone gets stabbed or fucking...  Well...  Freezes in their tent, like you're saying.  Yeah, freezing...  Yeah.  Because it's getting really fucking...  Well, it was cold.  Yeah, yeah.  I was going to say it's getting really fucking cold, but it's going to go back to sort of  fall.  So we got at least another month before that really bad starts rolling in, you know?  Yeah, it's going to be in the 50s.  And if, you know, someone fucking dies in the middle of the night because they're too fucking 
[00:47:30]  cold, that'll stop it, too.  Then they're going to have to, yeah, use that as the sacrificial lamb to go in there and  say, well, now it's a safety issue.  Of course.  You guys got to get out of here.  And then they'll say, well, the city took away our ability to survive in the cold, so there'll  be a huge lawsuit on the part of the family and it'll just cost us more money.  Great.  It was kind of a hilarious move that the city said, look, you got to get rid of your heaters  knowing this big storm.  No, the storm's coming in.  Like the day before the storm came in, they're wheeling generators away. 
[00:48:00]  And the dummies are out there.  The fire marshals are walking through the park just taking anything away that could keep them  warm.  They're saying it's a fire hazard?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's part of the thing.  But they waited for like the coldest day of the year so far.  But the dumb fucking protesters also, they're like, we got fire extinguishers.  What are they talking about?  It's like, really?  If a gas can explodes, I don't think your dumb fire brigade, your protester fire brigade, they  think they have everything.  We got our kitchen, our library, we got our fire extinguishers.  That's like our fire department.  Do they have any police? 
[00:48:30]  Do they have any fucking stormtroopers down there that rack some head and keep the peace?  I'm starting to notice that they got their own muscle.  Yeah, they got some muscle down there?  Yeah.  I'm starting to see the same type of guys, but now they're kind of walking around and  kind of like trying to control certain situations.  This is absolutely like SimCity.  When you start SimCity, it's like, all right, we're building.  I played SimCity a lot.  I love it.  And when you first start, it's like, this is cool. 
[00:49:00]  I'm going to put this here.  I'm going to put my power plant.  I got my water.  I got this.  Oh, look, people are starting to occupy my city.  Great.  And then, oh, wait a minute.  What the fuck is this?  There's a fire somewhere.  I got to put it out.  And then the shit starts hitting the fan.  Right.  And you don't know what to do.  Yeah.  It's like, ah, that's what's happening.  I think so.  It's going to start.  They got all the things in place, but then it's going to start breaking down.  As a social experiment, it's extremely interesting.  Interesting to watch.  I like going out and trying to film goofy shit, but I like also just studying it. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Because it's exactly what you're saying.  They got their own medical.  It looks like they sort of have their own, quote, police or security or bouncer type individuals.  Just to keep from having shit busted up.  They got a media area.  They got that dumb library that's looking lamer and lamer every time they're around there.  They got food, way to eat.  And they have their homeless.  And then I wasn't sure if it was garbage or laundry, but they were piling up tons and tons of garbage bags filled with, they looked like clothes. 
[00:50:00]  And I think it's, I mean, I saw clothes, but I wasn't sure if there was other stuff in the bags.  And I think they were collecting everyone's laundry and someone was going to haul it off.  Yeah.  And get it cleaned.  How do you claim yours?  Because I would just pick the nice stuff.  I don't know how you do that.  Get some bum going, oh, the diesels are mine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe it's, I don't know, maybe it's a community fucking type of situation.  They're going to wash these clothes, put it in the area, and then you take what you want. 
[00:50:30]  Sweatpants or something.  Okay.  Yeah, I don't know.  I didn't wait around for them to pick up all the bags.  I wasn't sure if it was garbage or laundry they were taking care of, so.  Good luck to you.  Yep.  It's great.  Yeah.  He just happens to be supporting all these groups of people when he's selling a book, so.  What a load of shit that fat fuck is.  I like Michael Moore.  Even though he's.  He's an asshole phony. 
[00:51:00]  He's a phony.  In a lot of ways, I think you're right.  This is his business.  He makes a lot of money.  Yeah, he does.  Of course he does.  A lot of fucking money.  Now he's making a film on this or something?  He's going to try?  Why wouldn't he?  If I thought for a second he actually had any feelings behind this, where he actually supported it, I would be like, all right, you know, whatever.  I'd still hate him, but.  He dresses like shit, because he's scared shitless that people are going to realize he's a multi-millionaire.  Yeah.  Multi-millionaire.  And a multi-millionaire over, you know, for this type of thing. 
[00:51:30]  Dresses like Roland.  Yeah.  Oh, shorts.  Yeah, he's got his shorts on.  That's Roger and me.  Why do you like him?  Because I liked what he, there's certain points he makes that I do agree with, even though he's way too far left for me.  But I liked some points he made, like in Sicko, there was some really valid overall points I thought about, I just thought there were some valid points about what have we become as a country. 
[00:52:00]  And even though he might be full of shit, and a lot, as a nation, we're just, and I'm guilty too.  But the fact that there are people that don't have, that don't get medicine here, it's just bizarre to me that we have, even though technically you can't take it from people and force them to, but like we don't have that compassion for each other.  Right.  And that's what kind of bugs me.  It's like, and I'm, again, I like to buy shit for myself, and I don't think about like, wow, man, some people are not eating.  Like people who aren't lazy, but legitimately people who are just having a really hard time. 
[00:52:30]  And I shouldn't be penalized for that.  I think.  But I should go, oh, fuck, man, this guy's hungry, let me help him out.  The majority of that, yeah, and there are charities, and there are people that are charitable, and I think for the most part, things get done.  I think when you see homeless people, that they're crazy.  I think 99% of homeless people are just crazy people.  They fell out of society, they can't fit, and that's what they do.  I don't think it's these families that are together in a shelter because the husband lost his job and can't get another one, and they're all sane and trying to get back into society. 
[00:53:00]  No, they're fucking lunatics.  And this idiot, fucking Michael Moore, is such a fucking phony, he's selling a book, he's fucking on a tour, pretty much a tour of these things, where he gets all these people saying, yeah, Michael Moore's supporting us, because they're too stupid to realize that they're Marx. 
[00:53:30]  They're just Marx for him.  He's a carny.  He is their target demo.  They're his target demo.  Oh, absolutely.  And those films he makes, it's selective editing, and he really can make this country look horrible.  But if you want socialized medicine and want everyone to have health care, it's going to be at the sacrifice of quality health care.  And this fat fuck, the second that heart of his is full of Elmer's glue, do you think he's going to go to some fucking clinic that any dirtbag can go to? 
[00:54:00]  Because now we have socialized medicine?  Or do you think he's going to get the best surgeon that money can fucking buy for his fat ass?  Yes.  And that's been something that all these politicians, too, that support Obamacare and all that other horse shit.  You think Kennedy, when his brains were leaking out his fucking ears, and he's supporting fucking Obama, you think he didn't go to the best fucking doctor he could go to to try to live as long as he possibly could? 
[00:54:30]  That would be gone.  Well, that's the point, too.  It's almost like, I agree.  And why does someone, there was an email going around, I don't know how factual it was, but like soldiers who fought veterans, I mean, their health care is not nearly as good as a one-time congressperson or representative who gets great health care for life.  And it's like, why do these fucking people get the best health care, and a guy who's gone over and fucking, who's fought for a country not, maybe they get some health care, but how long does it last in the military? 
[00:55:00]  They don't get the same health care as a U.S. representative does.  I guarantee you that.  Well, that's just stupid.  Yeah, but it's just silly.  That point is just stupid.  Anthony's funny, but he's a moron.  Yeah, a complete moron.  I didn't say that.  Thank you.  I know, I just did.  I'm not going to ban you for your opinion.  Call me a moron.  I don't care.  You just look like a shithead, uninformed cunt, is what you look like.  Sorry.  Sorry, lady balls.  Is that who wrote that?  Do you agree we got him?  Goddamn rich cunt!  Do you agree, though, that we have to pump up the health care in this country yet? 
[00:55:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  Even pump it up a little bit.  No.  No?  No.  Somewhere in between?  No.  See, like, people should be able to go out and get the doctors they want.  I just think that for people who are poor and really can't afford a basic health care, you're right, it won't be the same.  It won't be.  And it shouldn't be.  No one gets the same thing.  I'm not saying that it should be, but I think that somebody who has no money legitimately or really makes shit money.  Go to a fucking hospital emergency room.  They will absolutely take you. 
[00:56:00]  They are legally bound to take you and fucking treat you, no matter how dirt poor you are.  Right.  They are.  But how about stuff like preventative medicine and stuff like that?  Yeah, it would be nice if we could revamp the system and take, again, a lot of the corruption out of it, a lot of the waste that is in the industry, and especially in the insurance industry.  I understand that.  And for anyone asking me what my answer is, I don't have it, so blow me.  But I'm saying that there are people that are smart, smarter than me when it comes to this stuff that should try to do that without revamping the entire system and trying to tell me that there are wealthy people like Michael Moore that are looking to sacrifice the best care he can get so that the masses can get health care. 
[00:56:30]  Because he'd be full of shit if he told me that.  Well, would that be – that's the thing.  Like, how come those things can't go hand in hand?  Like, why can't, like – if you can afford good insurance and great health care, you get it.  But if you can't, there's just something in place so people who make nothing can have preventative care so it doesn't have to just be in the emergency room. 
[00:57:00]  Well, then you'd get the argument that that isn't good enough.  Why isn't my preventative care as good as the fucking guy that made a million dollars?  There's – oh, shit.  See, we should all – it always goes to – people will always want more.  But is that –  Give them whatever they got, they're going to want fucking more.  Maybe.  But just because people will be greedy about it doesn't mean that the – there shouldn't be that in place.  It's almost like saying just because there's innocent people thrown in jails, we shouldn't have jails. 
[00:57:30]  Like, people are going to be – it's going to be abused or there's going to be people who complain for no reason.  But I'm only wondering why, like, can't we have a basic thing just for people who can't afford it where they don't have to go to the fucking emergency room.  That's all.  Maybe we could.  So everyone has something.  But not at the expense of the people that have toiled and reached a point in this country where they're able to enjoy a standard of living.  Why should that person be penalized for this new socialist fucking attitude that everybody has that makes everyone think they're entitled to things that are a privilege? 
[00:58:00]  People are seeing privilege as entitlements these days.  And if you want to fucking start some kind of a French Revolution thing, you better start getting some guns and shooting because your dumb signs ain't going to do it.  But until then, shut the fuck up.  Take what you got.  Use the country like it's supposed to be used as a place of opportunity and not a place of entitlement and fucking socialism. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I thought you meant use the country like a drunk whore.  Well, some people do.  Some people do.  I forgot to tell you about Occupy Wall Street.  There was a guy doing an interview saying –  Oh, no.  This is our Valley Forge.  Oh, God.  Ew.  Because it was cold out.  Because it was – really?  Because it was cold out.  You're equating sitting in the city where you could piss in a McDonald's and fucking –  Ew.  With what they went through in the Revolutionary War.  It's so – 
[00:59:00]  Fighting for freedom in the freezing cold.  It's so enjoyable to be down there.  Oh, God.  These fucking –  And then you do come across some people that are down there for the right reason because they just feel like, you know, they should be able to have more, you know, in this country.  But in general, man, God, you come across Valley Forge guy.  It's terrific.  Valley Forge.  This is our Valley Forge.  Self-important douche.  And I don't know who the professionals are and who are the schmucks like myself, but some guy has a camera on him. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And the guy's just staring at him like, were you expecting me to jump up and down?  You know?  Yeah.  Like he thought this was, like, going to really get everyone juiced.  I got this.  No, without a doubt, every guy and girl whizzes in the shower.  Yeah.  Oh.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  You guys didn't know the mics were off.  Oh, really?  Is that what happened there?  Yeah, because you went, oh. 
[01:00:00]  You guys were just talking about whizzing in the shower.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's literal Jim Jersey.  He's the asshole.  Ah, fuck you.  Ah!  Anth is crazy.  You can have capitalism with government programs.  I know.  Look, I don't need the government up my ass, and I don't need everybody thinking that everyone  is entitled to everything just because other people have it.  There's going to be haves and have-nots.  That's what this country is, and it's based on things like hard work, luck. 
[01:00:30]  There's plenty of fucking variables that make people wealthy and make people poor, make  people happy, make people sad, make people sick, make people well.  But it doesn't mean you're entitled to all of them.  But there are too many have-nots these days.  No, there aren't.  There really aren't.  That's what they're saying.  No, there are too many people living beyond their fucking means because they think they  should have something because they see other people having it. 
[01:01:00]  So they overextend themselves and end up fucking themselves and then blame everyone else but  themselves.  I might be getting corrected on Twitter, so let me read this.  Yes, sir.  One guy said to me, veterans get health care for life through the Veterans Affairs for Life.  I think I said for life twice, not him.  I just don't think it's the same quality as, say, a representative gets, which kind of bugs me.  And then someone says preventative care for the poor does exist, Medicaid.  Okay.  Do they get preventative medicine?  If they do, then there you go. 
[01:01:30]  Or I was incorrect.  A little bit, a little bit.  Well, Justin could fill us in in the vet health care situation.  I don't care about animals.  Justin, really fast.  Oof.  Thanks, O.  I got it.  Oof.  I got to do it real quick.  The basic idea, when you're in, you get seen by your corpsman, which is the same guy  who, you know, you deploy with, who puts you back together if you get shot.  Your family gets to see those same people on base.  And once you're out, you're out.  Nobody gives a shit about you.  I had to go and borrow money from my parents to buy my own health care now that I'm out. 
[01:02:00]  Wow.  Jesus.  That just doesn't seem right, man.  We can't even figure that one out, Ant?  Come on.  Yeah, I know.  Well, we got guys.  We lost more fucking Americans over the weekend.  Yeah, that does suck.  And these guys come back, and obviously they got issues because they were in a war zone  for all those years, and we're not taking care of them if they leave.  But Gabrielle Giffords gets popped in the head, and she should have the best care for that.  But I guarantee you, she's getting much better fucking care than the guy who went over to 
[01:02:30]  Iraq and got fucking shot in the spine or something.  I guarantee you, her care is at a different level.  See, that's bullshit, right?  That shit's got to change at the very least, Ant.  I agree.  I totally agree.  Our soldiers should have health care for the rest of their lives.  Absolutely.  I'm totally for that.  I wouldn't want to fucking go over there and deal with that shit.  Huh?  To get my medication for my depression, I actually had to borrow money from my parents  because, you know, nobody would help me out at all.  So I had to borrow money to get the medication that I need to function on a daily basis for 
[01:03:00]  my depression and my PTSD.  Were you depressed before you went into the service, sir?  No.  No, I came back from Iraq all fucked up.  It cost me my marriage and everything.  It's been a mess.  I'll handle this one.  Sir, cheer up.  You're welcome, my friend.  Thank you, sir.  Take care of Justin and the rest of the soldiers at the very fucking least.  Oh, absolutely.  Jesus.  I've always been for that.  I can't stand when there are people that have made sacrifices and are treated like shit. 
[01:03:30]  That's fucked up.  You look at some of the first responders down there at Ground Zero and the shitload of red  tape they've got to go through just to, you know, get health care based on something that,  you know, they didn't ask for it.  They didn't ask for mesothelioma and fucking lung cancer and whatever other problems they're  having.  They went down there and did what they felt they had to do.  And now to have to sit there with some bureaucratic bullshit. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  And that to me is embarrassing.  That to me is where Michael Moore makes a point.  What have we become?  I agree with that.  That's what I'm talking about.  It's like that, how does that happen where we don't just say like, well, this is terrible.  These guys have to be taken care of immediately and for the rest of their life.  Like how, how is that not just something we do instinctively as a country?  I don't like the piggybacking of people that think that they're entitled to it for no reason.  You got young, healthy people that are holding up signs that say they want, they want, they 
[01:04:30]  want.  You could fucking, you should count your fucking blessings, you cunts, because you, you, you're  healthy and you should be working, uh, and, and making your own way in life instead of  holding up signs saying, I want, I want, I want blow me.  But those guys to me, you're right, but they're not as despicable as whoever it is that is making  these first responders run.  To me, the people that run through red tape are the greater, that make you run, are the  greater evil than a bunch of dummies down there who will eventually grow out of that  shit anyway.  And, and it's weird because you can't put a face to it or a name. 
[01:05:00]  It's a system that's in place.  It's a system.  So you can't single out who's fucking these people over.  That's why it's bureaucracy.  It's red tape.  There's no one guy that's fucking the veterans over.  The whole thing's got to be changed in some way.  Uh, and again, I don't know what the fuck that is.  Well, the protests don't even know.  Shock, shock.  Everyone is like the other one.  They've all become cookie cutter.  Oh, shit.  Cookie cutter.  It took you an hour and 15 for that.  I just thought of it. 
[01:05:30]  No, without a doubt, every guy and girl whizzes in the show.  Yeah.  Oh.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks.  I guess I was being edgy there.  In case you don't know, I was being edgy there.  Why?  I did forget.  Discussing stuff that shouldn't be discussed on the radio.  The grand finale of October is upon us.  And it does involve us.  The Opie and Anthony radio show.  Well, you know what?  Usually I dig up the old tapes.  Yeah, yeah.  You dug this one up. 
[01:06:00]  Found these in some box of radio stuff.  The only defense I got.  You already backpedaled.  Fuck yeah, man.  The only defense I got.  This is 1997.  97, man.  It's the only defense I got.  And you said you met Groucho Marx when you were a kid, right?  Yeah.  What was that, like 80, 81?  What are you talking about, Sam?  You are such a fucking asshole, Sam.  What are you talking about, Sam? 
[01:06:30]  Well, today we'll listen to Opie and Anthony as they relate to their listeners, all of whom,  including O and A, grew up in the 80s.  I don't know if you knew that about Opie and Anthony.  They grew up, like, when they were growing.  Well, I was a late bloomer, Sam.  It was the 80s.  I was a late bloomer.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh.  You mean Ant doesn't mention how the first fucking movie he saw in the drive-in was Midnight  Cowboy and drove a date to it? 
[01:07:00]  We grew up in the 80s, Sam.  I know.  I know.  And you make that clear that a lot of us, meaning you and the listeners, since you're all, you  know, the same, grew up in the 80s.  That's right.  We're going to do this after the break, huh?  I think so.  And the conclusion of Jocktober, the Opie and Anthony show from 1997, we're at WAF.  I hope Bill Burr's late, because he won't give us a fucking beating.  No, no, that's good. 
[01:07:30]  That's great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, you sounded good.  Real sincere.  Dude, what?  People whiz in the shower.  You talked about it.  It's fine.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's good.  Perfect day to have Bill Burr in.  What do you think I was getting at there, Jimmy?  I don't know.  You were saying the guys and gals whiz in the shower.  And just probably like a topic, like to get things talking, like everybody going, yeah,  he's right.  We do.  I think it was also your way of letting the audience know, not only are you irreverent  on the air, but when the mics are off too, because like you said, you went, oh, you didn't 
[01:08:00]  realize the mics were on.  This is just you being you.  Oh, you were pretending that was off the air?  Yeah, that's the point.  Oh, no, that wasn't me.  No, no, no.  Why did I even have friends?  And why would you be so close to the mic and go, guys and girls, who talks about that off  the air and says, guys and girls whiz in the shower into the mic?  Yeah.  Especially whiz.  But, but, Opie, you were also the one turning the mics on.  Yeah.  So it's like, how could you not know, like, for a second?  Oh, like, oh.  Well, I obviously knew because I said whiz instead of piss. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Piss would have got us in trouble.  Yeah.  I didn't, can I, dude, can I hear that again?  I didn't catch that.  Seriously?  Yeah, I really didn't catch that.  No, without a doubt, every guy and girl whizzes in the shower.  Yeah.  Oh.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks.  That's Academy Award.  He didn't realize.  Oh.  Would you have a, Opie, if you went back?  If you went back in time, would you have any problems with, with that guy who went, 
[01:09:00]  Oh.  Yeah, I would, sir.  You'd have to tell him, be careful with these edgy conversations.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Be a little more careful next time.  Maybe, like, you go back in time and show the old you how to work the board a little  more properly.  Yeah.  My thought today is really simple.  I, I know I had friends in 1997.  Why would you hang out with that guy?  There's nothing interesting about him.  I want to hear the next break.  Uh, what, Rocky Road or Chocolate?  Oh.  Oh, we're back on.  That's a fake edge.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  It was before smartphones, people.  I guess we got a bunch of these clips.  That was just a little preview clip.  That's before you get into the, uh.  That guy was getting laid.  What?  That guy was getting laid.  Why?  How is that even possible?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  We'll, uh, break and I guess we'll do the conclusion of Jocktober.  You're stretching this out like you're walking home about to show your mom a report card that  you know is terrible.  Yeah.  Just putting it off.  Yeah.  Taking the long way home. 
[01:10:00]  Make it a stop at the store.  I got a tinkle anyway.  What?  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Why would you show up here with a Halloween costume on?  Who is that?  It's Halloween.  Wait.  Is it a?  It's Nicole.  It's Nicole.  Your buddy Nicole.  Nicole is dressed as a whoopee cushion.  Yeah, mate.  She's running away.  Why are you dressed like that?  Did you lose a bet?  Yeah.  Hi.  Oh, okay.  Did you lose a bet?  I lost a bet.  All right.  Because there's no way you would have done this. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, you were dressed as a whoopee cushion.  You think I would ever choose this outfit?  To walk around to work all day in?  What was the bet?  Warm.  You bring your dog to work.  Are you disappointed I didn't bring my dog?  She would have looked good with this costume, I think.  What was the bet?  Um, that Rich couldn't get abs in a month, like an actual six pack.  Does he?  He did it, and then he, like, started gorging himself.  But, I mean, he did it.  They're gone now.  But he had it.  He had it for, like, a couple.  That's genetics.  Yeah, he really.  He wasn't able to do that.  So what?  You have to wear this for the day? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  I can't.  It's all right.  It's not that bad.  I've seen worse.  It's not that good, though.  You didn't make it.  They were going to make me be sexy Osama Bin Laden, so I think I'm happy with the whoopee  cushion.  Oh, it's just.  I know.  You should have sexed it up.  It's like a sham wow.  How did you sex up a whoopee cushion?  She did.  This is hot.  But why?  Did you?  You couldn't pick your costume?  No, that was the bet.  They got to make me dress up as whatever they wanted.  People got to sit on you?  You're going to be all sexed up.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that wasn't.  They wanted to embarrass me.  Can you do that?  I think you work with swishy guys. 
[01:11:30]  Why wouldn't they want you in a hot Halloween costume?  Because they've seen me in hot Halloween costumes.  They're over it.  They just look at you.  They look at you like a sister, right, at this point?  Yeah.  Your old hat to them.  Yeah, I think they're over me.  I would have had her in a strap-on with a fucking hammer.  Right?  I mean, it was a bizarre outfit.  You would have gotten creative.  Strap on with a hammer.  Yeah.  Well, you guys haven't worked with me for five years.  Yeah, that's true.  We would have made you sexy.  Okay.  Well, I love that.  Maybe next year we'll make a bet that I'll lose and you can dress me up sexy. 
[01:12:00]  That's going to get warm, isn't it?  Oh, I'm hot already.  I'm sweating balls.  Yeah, it is some kind of big cottony thing you're dressed in.  Well, have fun.  Happy Halloween.  Oh, thank you.  Is it really genetics yet?  Yeah, a lot of things are genetics.  Some people can try and try and try to lose weight and get abs and shit like that, but  if you can't get rid of that fat in front because of simple genetics, you're going to  have a problem.  I think so.  You can do it.  It's just going to take so much more effort.  It's like girls that have a great fucking body and other girls that are chunky. 
[01:12:30]  They can lose the weight, but they're never going to have that amazing body.  Genetics are absolutely involved.  Yeah.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  There goes my fucking elliptical stairmaster routine.  Oh, no, don't give up.  Don't give up because you might not attain the level of abdom that other guys do, but  it'll keep you in shape.  I never wanted abs.  Keep you healthy and happy.  I never wanted a six-pack.  How'd you get that V?  You got one, though.  Don't have a V. 
[01:13:00]  God just gave you that.  That body didn't come with a lot of hard work.  Lucky you.  Sometimes that bottom button pops open.  It's like, enjoy the show.  That's a treat, not a trick.  We're going to have a live remote soon.  Don't do this to me.  Fuck.  What happened to you?  Nothing.  This is how I've always been.  It looks good, man.  It looks good.  Don't be bashful.  Even when I was anorexic, I didn't have a hint of a fucking ab.  Fuck yeah, you look good.  You do now.  Jesus Christ.  It's more than a hint.  It's an announcement of an ab.  They see us at appearances, and it's just like, oh boy. 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to tape it down this year.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Tape it down.  I'm going to just fucking duct tape it.  Wear a girdle.  Maybe get a girdle.  Maybe I'll do that.  All right.  Let's eat.  Let's eat?  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  So what's up, brother, man?  I think it comes in now.  I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight, for my monster 
[01:14:00]  from his slab began to rise, and suddenly, to my surprise, he did the mash.  He did the monster mash, the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  He did the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  He did the mash.  He did the monster mash.  From my laboratory in the castle east, to the master bedroom where the vampires feast, 
[01:14:30]  the ghouls all came from humble abodes to get a jolt from my electrodes.  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They did the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The zombies were having fun.  The party had just begun.  The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son. 
[01:15:00]  The scene was rocking, and all were digging the sounds.  Igor on chains, backed by the banging hounds.  The coffin bangers were about to arrive with the vocal group, the Crypt Kicker 5.  They did the monster mash.  They played the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They played the monster mash. 
[01:15:30]  They caught on in a flash.  They played the mash.  Then they played the monster mash.  This got a lot of lyrics.  Out from his coffin, Drax's voice did ring.  Seems he was troubled by just one thing.  He opened the lid and shook his fist and said,  Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  The monster mash. 
[01:16:00]  And it's a graveyard smash.  It's now the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  Now everything's cool.  Drax's a part of the band.  And my monster mash is a hit of the land.  For you the living this mash was meant to.  When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you. 
[01:16:30]  What did they do?  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And do my graveyard smash.  They can do the mash.  It'll caught on in a flash.  They can do the mash.  Then you do the monster mash.  Oh!  Bob Soda Kenny, everyone.  Wow.  Fantastic.  It will caught on in a flash. 
[01:17:00]  It will caught on in a flash.  Thinking of all the cool creatures that I will meet tonight.  Ghosts and goblins and witches roaming the streets in moonlight.  Bowls of candy and goodies delicious and waiting in store. 
[01:17:30]  The sound of cute little footsteps as they approach my front door.  Letting the children inside.  Letting the children inside to drink beers.  Razor blades hidden in three musketeers.  Screams from the basement of kids begging to be set free.  That's what Halloween means to me. 
[01:18:00]  That's what Halloween means to me.  Scary.  Tightening the clamps that are holding their little heads so tight.  Putting my lips to their ears as I whisper,  Please, don't fight.  I promise I'll let you go home if you swear not to tell a soul. 
[01:18:30]  Well, I'll just untie these.  I'm kidding.  Now where is my chainsaw?  Let's rock and roll.  A pinch of your brother, a teaspoon of you.  With the head of your sister would make a good stew.  I'd give you a taste, but your tongue's in the stew.  Irony.  That's what Halloween means to me. 
[01:19:00]  No, nothing on the irony part?  Nothing?  All right.  Trick or treat, smell my feet.  See, irony is an incongruity between what's expected and what actually happens.  So you can't taste it because your tongue is in said stew.  See, I mean, maybe it sends a signal to your brain, but you can't really.  Trick or treat, smell my feet.  Damn it.  Give me something good to eat. 
[01:19:30]  I've got to change that line.  Trick or treat, smell my feet.  Smell my feet.  Give me someone good to eat.  Ooh, ah, Halloween.  Yeah.  Stephen Lynch, Halloween from his new CD, The Craig Machine.  I'm changing that line.  No, that's funny.  Nobody ever laughs at that line.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:20:00]  Call 866-WOW-1.  Wow.  That's 866-969-1969.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy.  I hope I've got to plug this thing here.  Go, Jimmy, go.  That we have coming up.  This weekend, I'm at the Stress Factory.  Whoa, wait.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, ha, ha.  You're full of tricks today.  And I'm promoting brokerage 11th and 12th, also on Long Island. 
[01:20:30]  But this is an Opie and Anthony event.  It's called Thanks for Nothing, an Opie and Anthony holiday event, Thursday, November  the 17th.  Is it, we're doing really 8 to 10, followed by ONA Live, oh, from 10 to 11.  So it's really an 8 to 11 event.  We're going to be at the Hard Rock here in New York.  Visit SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony for details and RSVP for seats on the floor.  You don't have to RSVP to get in the door. 
[01:21:00]  There's going to be plenty of space, but if you want to just show up, that's fine.  But if you want a seat with a table, don't be a dick.  Just RSVP.  That's not confusing, right?  No.  Because we changed it up a little bit, because we got really pissed off.  It doesn't even say where.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely doesn't say where.  It doesn't say where.  You know why?  Because I know where it is, so I don't have to put it on there.  But Jimmy said the whole thing.  I thought he had a perfect plug.  I wasn't even thinking. 
[01:21:30]  I mean, I did say where, too.  I shouldn't have.  You did.  You did say where.  You did?  He definitely said where.  Okay, okay.  That's why.  I was starting to look like, where does it say where?  Maybe I can't say it.  Hard Rock Cafe.  Hard Rock.  Two weeks from Thursday, we're going live again.  Because someone enjoys us being out and about.  Yes.  We've got to do something fun.  We should get girls with tits and little outfits together.  Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  Really?  No jiggly jiggly jiggle.  Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  Jiggles are great.  They really are. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, of course it is.  Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  I love jiggling tits.  Whatever.  We'll have a good time.  I love jiggling tits.  I also love non-jiggling A cups.  Those are hot.  Whatever.  As long as there's a nipple on it, I'll suck it.  Something perky?  Believe me, if you have a fucking tumor with a nipple on it, I'll rub my dick on it.  Come.  That's a bumper sticker.  I'm selling it for my show.  Small is definitely okay, but A is rough.  I don't mind that.  A is rough.  Yeah.  Let's start with the B.  Yeah.  I mean, let's say, I don't care, because I know men and women, we all pee in the shower. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Why do we do this?  Fuck.  Oh.  Okay.  That's right.  I forgot what we were going to delve into here.  Well, today's the last day of Jocktober.  By the way, Scott and Todd, I just got to communicate.  Their phone scam, Tricks for Treats, was so good this morning, they're going to replay it at 9.30 for everybody.  Wow.  They're teasing it.  They're so proud of this one.  Tricks for Treats. 
[01:23:00]  They're so proud of this fake phone scam.  They're going to replay it at 9.30.  You think it's fake?  They're already tweeting.  I think it's fake.  Of course it is.  Or Tricks for Treats.  And it was done years ago.  Probably.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  It might not be fake.  It's either fake or 15 years old.  But they'll make believe it was done today.  We found out they do have that huge catalog of phone calls that they just rotate through, right?  Oh, they do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm playing a Tricks for Treats one from 85.  That was funny when you called that guy and he said you got candy and Tricks for Treats. 
[01:23:30]  Fucking asshole.  Fucking rock face.  Oh, he sickens me.  And then he had to do some firing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a classic.  Cody fires a plastic surgeon and dentist.  He gets to continue being on the air, but he fired people around him.  Yeah.  Jocks that certainly still have it.  Oh, yeah.  Have the voice and the energy and the passion to do it.  But rock face gets to continue. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Let's get into this.  Fuck.  All right.  Anthony found a tape.  He brought it in for the conclusion of Jocktober where we turn it upon ourselves, I guess.  Well, you know, I think it shows that even we weren't immune to doing some hacky things in the past.  1997.  97.  There's actually a Facebook page.  Yeah.  What is it?  The dash Opie dash Anthony dash show dash from dash 1997. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  How are they going to find that?  And if you search it, it's the Opie ampersand Anthony show from 1997.  Ampersand.  Ampersand.  How many people have liked that page?  There's already 558 likes.  All right.  They're having a good time with it.  And there's a banner for WAAF.  Even though we play the same exact playlist as the other 792 stations that really rock, the station that really rocks WAAF.  The only station that really rocks. 
[01:25:00]  I don't know what they call themselves now, but we were the only station, even though we were playing the exact playlist of BCN.  And that made sense.  Here we go.  From 1997, Opie got a cool email.  The topic being, you might be a child of the 80s if.  If.  Do you want the official Jocktober intro so you can push this off another minute?  Okay.  No.  No, because I'm trying to push this through before Bill Burr shows up.  Oh, this is bad.  Why?  Because it's going to be bad enough with Jimmy beating the shit out of us. 
[01:25:30]  But if Bill joins, fuck.  He'll enjoy it.  If Bill Burr gets here, let him come right in.  Because he would really enjoy this.  He was supposed to be here by now.  Aw.  That's a shame.  To beat us up.  Very cool topic since Opie and Anthony grew up in the 80s.  That's right, Sam.  That's right, Sam.  Child of the 80s.  That's right, Sam.  We were a child of the 80s.  Yes.  You know, along with the listeners at the time.  Sure.  Sure.  We related.  I could officially say I was still a teenager in the 80s.  I could officially say that, Sam. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  I mean, I'll take your word for it.  I didn't know your growing years, though, were in that.  I could officially say I was a teenager.  That's all I'm going to say.  In the 80s.  Yeah.  Look.  Yes.  Technically, I was in high school in the 80s.  Yeah, but you were also in high school in the 70s and late 60s.  You just didn't do particularly well.  I didn't do well.  All right, let's do this.  I got a cool email from, I don't even know from who, actually.  Why? 
[01:26:30]  Wouldn't it say it on the fucking email?  Of course.  You're crinkling the paper.  Oh, no.  It's a cool email.  Yeah.  Er, ner.  Well, in 1997, emails were cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I tell you, a cooler email would have been one with a link to fucking meat spin.  That means I read this somewhere and decided to make it more organic.  Organic.  Organic.  Are you using your radio knowledge to make it a little more organic?  Right.  Not just reading it.  I got an email here.  Instead, this was my show prep for the day.  And you want to sound like, you know, hey, look, we're emailing. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  There's a welcome to Jocktober message on the Opie and Anthony show from 1997 Facebook page.  Oh.  Wonderful.  I don't have that part, unfortunately.  Okay.  But it's a whole list of you might be a child of the 80s.  A child of the 80s?  A lot of us grew up in the 80s.  That's true.  That was.  That's true.  Why are you laughing at that, Sam?  A lot of us grew up in the 80s.  You said us.  A lot of us grew up in the 80s.  You should have said a lot of you grew up in the 80s.  Not a lot of us. 
[01:27:30]  I was officially a teenager in the 80s.  You were grown up.  I was officially a teenager in the 80s.  That is not a lie.  The bit is not where you, it said, were you a child of the 80s?  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Did the U.S. government classify you as an adult?  Which you most certainly were not.  A child of the 80s.  Yeah.  I barely was.  80s.  That's true.  That was our growing years, okay?  Our growing years.  You remember when Jordan S. Jeans were cool.  I hate to admit it, but if you...  Oh, I hate to... 
[01:28:00]  Why?  I can't do this today.  Why not?  This is so difficult.  That was funny.  I can't do this today.  Look, sure you did some embarrassing things in the 80s, but those were your growing years.  Yeah.  You were just a boy.  Your growth was stunted for a long time.  I didn't even realize that angle on this whole thing until Sam just started beating us with it.  Well, I didn't either until I started listening, and I was like, wait a minute.  And you know why it was?  It was because Opie, on Friday when you were talking about AAF, said that you guys used 
[01:28:30]  to pretend to be younger to relate to your audience, and then when I put this in, and  then you guys started...  I was like, oh, this is it.  Prime example.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grew my hair along, started saying, dude, a lot more.  Added some A's to words.  Yeah!  Oh, fuck.  You were a teenager in Sweden?  This is not going to be pleasant.  Fuck me with a stick.  Look to your right.  It's going to get worse.  Oh, yes! 
[01:29:00]  Ah, yeah.  Look who's walking down the hallway.  Bill Burr.  Well, you couldn't have been older than 27, 28 here?  What, in 97?  Yeah.  Right?  Mr. Burr.  Bill Burr.  Welcome to the show.  Bill Burr.  Good timing.  Going to be on Jimmy Fallon tonight, I hear?  Yes, I am.  Oh, that's good.  Congratulations.  Yes, I am.  That's a good one.  You, uh...  This is the worst day to have in the year.  Not for Bill. 
[01:29:30]  Why?  Well...  You're going to enjoy today, sir.  What did I walk in on here?  Well, we've done this thing called Jocktober over the years.  Oh, I remember that.  And we take every October.  Yeah.  We feature every day a show that sucks and is hacky and, you know, a typical broadcast radio  drivel with the hole and the, you know, the chick that's got to keep them all in line.  Wacky morning shows.  Wacky morning shows.  What am I explaining to you?  You've been on a thousand of them across the country.  Yeah.  We've done ten or twelve.  You've been on one right now.  Exactly.  You're just kidding.  Exactly.  Well, we always finish off by dredging up a bit of our own past. 
[01:30:00]  And I found a CD of one of our, like our first year on WAF.  This is from 1997.  Dude, last time I saw you guys do this, Anthony was hiding under his coat.  He was zipping up his winter coat over his face.  I kind of embraced it now.  Oh, so you were here for the last time we did.  No, this was years ago. 
[01:30:30]  This is the other studio there.  Yeah, we try to kill ourselves at least once during October.  Today's the day.  So congratulations to Bill Burr for picking today to come in.  Now, what you mean?  Any time.  What time ever you're doing?  Any time.  What we are doing here is something, a little bit, that kind of thread its way through the  show that day.  It was called, You're a Child of the 80s If.  You might be a child of the 80s If.  You might be a child of the 80s If. 
[01:31:00]  How'd you come up with that one?  I just have to be already in the middle of college.  The first one's been thrown out by Bill.  Should we do the set up so he finds it?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very organic.  Should we do the first track, too?  Yeah, of course.  There's a good laugh at the end of the first track.  I think we should.  Well, it starts with this.  This is the first track on the disc.  It's eight seconds.  It might be from the 80s If.  Well, no, no, no.  The child of the 80s.  The child of the 80s.  No, before we got to the topic, I take full responsibility.  I decided this was cool radio for 97. 
[01:31:30]  No, without a doubt, every guy and girl whizzes in the shower.  Yeah.  Oh.  107.3 WAF.  The only station that really rocks.  See, he turns the mic on, so why was he surprised that it was going out over the air?  I was so edgy.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Did that just go over the air?  Oh, I fell for that.  And I was like, no, you guys, you could see the beginnings of your next show, the next  part of your career.  You totally fooled me.  I like this guy.  I wish I was in the studio and could hear what they were talking about.  You totally had me. 
[01:32:00]  You didn't even bring it up.  I still would have been waiting for that.  What Sam brought up, though, that throughout this whole thing, we're talking about how  the listeners and us, of course, being children of the 80s ourselves.  They said that Opie and Anthony could relate to this because we, speaking to the listeners,  we all grew up in the 80s.  We were all children of the 80s.  We are referencing that Opie and Anthony did not do any growing whatsoever in the 80s.  I think I was already fucking married, drunk, driving past your house, lights are still 
[01:32:30]  on.  Fuck.  Oh, that's a great fucking callback.  I was officially a teenager in the 80s.  That's all I'm going to say.  And I did spend one half a year in high school in the 80s.  So technically, we were still growing up.  You drove past the Dakota right before Lennon got shot.  You're not a child of the 80s.  He stayed back a couple of years. 
[01:33:00]  He's one of those guys.  You got to hear the next.  It's a good lead in.  Sure.  Here we go.  I got a cool email from I don't even know from who, actually.  I don't have that part, unfortunately.  OK, but it's a whole list of you might be a child of the 80s.  Child of the 80s.  A lot of us grew up in the 80s.  That's true.  That was our growing years.  OK, you might be a child of the 80s if you remember when Jorda's jeans were cool.  I hate to admit it, but if you're a child of the 80s...  Go back to that laugh. 
[01:33:30]  The laugh is terrible.  Why is that funny?  It's awful.  I'm itching my face.  You didn't even think it was funny.  It's not even itchy.  What?  You didn't even think it was funny.  You didn't think it was funny today or back then?  No, of course not.  And I'm like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I just, I'm laughing.  We were just always nervous that our listeners were going to find out we were older than we were.  You guys probably remember wearing Jorda's jeans when you were kids, right?  When you were just little kids growing up in the 80s. 
[01:34:00]  Ann was a reiterating idiot, too.  Like, yeah, email.  OK, email.  Yeah, yeah.  Very smothers brothers.  I wish we'd been smothered.  It was a format for young men.  And we were a bit older than that.  So we were trying to, like, downplay to make believe we were younger than we were.  Growing up in the 80s.  That's always a great way to start your career.  Just start it off with a lie.  And then try and build everything up on that.  Yeah, on the lie.  That never crashes back down. 
[01:34:30]  Same part.  I was already in radio 10 years.  I was already in the classic rock stage of my career.  Dude, you're on AAF.  That's a huge station.  I was at the home of Rock and Roll before that where we would play Jethro Tull.  Like, it was classic rock.  And then all of a sudden we'd get the call to go to Boston.  Now we've got to, like, play rock music for young kids.  So we had to make believe we were a lot younger.  In the middle of the 90s when all that shit was out there.  Yeah.  And you could hear it in these old tapes that we were just trying to hold on and make believe we were young.  All these memories of the 80s. 
[01:35:00]  You actually had the memories working in radio full-time as an adult.  Those are your child of the 80s memories.  That's when you were growing.  The only thing I'll admit, I was officially a teenager in the 80s.  That's all I'm saying today.  Dude, but I remember that period because I was just old enough to feel lost when grunge music came out.  Right.  I was talking on my podcast.  You know, they do this whole 20-year retrospective of Nevermind.  And everybody's going, like, I knew, man, the second I saw that video, there was a change in the air. 
[01:35:30]  I had no clue.  No idea.  I was waiting for the next Skid Row record, and I thought it was awesome.  Slave to the grind.  I'm like, dude, this is even better than the fucking last one.  And all this shit.  And all of a sudden, everybody's wearing flannels.  Everything's just passing you by.  And you're like, I don't know.  Yeah, that's when I officially became old.  So everybody now is pissing me off.  Even people who got into that album, to say that you knew it was a moment.  Shut up.  I hated it.  And I didn't like how Kurt was making fun of tap-on solos in it. 
[01:36:00]  I'm like, this guy's a douche.  That's not a solo.  I love him now, but I'm not going to sit there, like, 20 years later, act like I knew.  I had no clue.  You thought it was just another band coming out, right?  Yeah.  ACDC had their best album in years, Razor's Edge.  Right.  I was all aboard.  Headbangers Ball.  Let's keep it going.  I had no clue.  You're right, though.  Thunderstruck was off that fucking album.  Yeah, it was great.  Money and whatever.  It was Thunderstruck.  That's hilarious. 
[01:36:30]  That was it?  That was it.  It was all that was on them.  That's all you needed.  That's all you needed.  There was a few others.  But what are the things that tell someone that they were a child of the 80s?  Here's the laugh.  I backed it up.  What if you remember when Jordan S. Jeans were cool?  I hate to admit it, but if you're a child of the 80s, everyone has a picture.  I think I wanted to give the impression I was like a pothead, too, because I figured the kids were smoking the weed.  You guys, I didn't include it because it wasn't part of the bit.  We've only got so much time on this show.  Lots of pot jokes. 
[01:37:00]  Well, you know, the kids were smoking the weed.  We wanted to fit in.  Yeah, smoking weed.  The mics are off.  Did you guys have, like, a meeting with, like, the Mr. Carlson, and they told you that, listen, you guys have to, or was this your own call?  Your own radio instincts?  We used to have air check meetings.  We used to have air check meetings, but we were doing our own thing.  But we had to sit.  So this is your guy's call.  It makes it even worse.  That was a good chance you could have passed it off on somebody else and probably should have taken that opportunity.  If we're going to get beat up, we might as well just be honest. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, this was our bit.  I hate to admit it, but if you're a child of the 80s, everyone has a picture of them with Jord-ass jeans on.  And Sassoon.  Sassoon.  Ooh, la la.  Sassoon.  You might be a child of the 80s.  Oh, okay, that one hurt.  That one hurt.  That one hurt a little?  Yeah, that one stung.  I didn't think I was going to get stung on that, but that stung.  I thought it was a nice improv.  Yeah, you obviously remember the commercial.  I mean, one of the things about being a good DJ is you have to know what's going on around you. 
[01:38:00]  I love it.  And be informed.  Wow.  I love this.  No ant.  That was great.  I feel such a dick at this.  I don't want you here.  Can you leave?  I don't like you.  Wow, that was bad.  I like that when someone mentions a commercial and someone can just do the commercial right  then and there.  I felt like I got hit on that one.  That was good.  I felt like, ah, fuck.  You got a little jab?  My legs wobbled a little.  I feel, yeah, yeah.  Now, I'm hoping I could sit through the rest.  Like, I could easily listen to that again and not even feel uncomfortable.  Shut up! 
[01:38:30]  Shut up, you son!  I was hoping he was being honest.  You might be a child of the 80s if, in your fifth grade class picture, you're wearing an  IZOD shirt with the collar up.  Something tells me you had some IZODs, Opie.  Easy.  Well, did you?  Honestly, no.  I never...  Hey, look out!  Wait, wait, wait.  Why?  I don't think that's that bad.  But here's why it's that bad.  It's like I called him a fucking asshole or something.  Yeah.  Easy there, IZOD shirt.  Watch out, that's crazy.  You also just implied that when you were in fifth grade, the decade was the 1980s. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  And like, he's saying that children had IZOD shirts, and you're like, well, you must have  had some.  Why would he?  No, he didn't.  No.  In the fifth grade?  No, he couldn't have been.  He was like 41.  He had a fucking tie by that time.  So I was applying what?  Skinny tie.  You were implying...  I was applying that one of the years of the 80s, I was 11 years old.  Is that what you're getting at?  When you were in fifth grade... 
[01:39:30]  That's 11.  ...the decade was the 1980s.  Yeah.  That's not enough.  Not even close.  No, no, not even close.  That would mean that you were born in 69.  How would you know?  I was a teenager in the 80s.  Because 69 plus 11 is 80.  I was a teenager in the 80s.  Fucking Sam.  Fuck you.  That goddamn Sam is pulling these fucking little tidbits out.  So you're trying to have the audience believe that we could be 11 years older in  the 80s.  I never would have figured that.  You didn't have an IZOD shirt when you were a kid.  No. 
[01:40:00]  No, you had a fucking, like a village people iron on, or something from...  Maybe an iron on.  ...74, 75.  That's right.  Yeah.  He was too old to be in Over the Edge when they made that money.  Nobody remembers that one.  I didn't see it.  ...wearing a Woodstock shirt that he got there.  Yeah.  How many more tracks, Sam?  That's bad.  When you graduated high school, was John Bonham still alive?  Oh, man.  That's a good one. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  September 25th, 1980.  He was not.  Oh, all right.  He wasn't.  80, right?  Yeah.  September 25th.  Mm-hmm.  He was not alive when I got there.  Okay.  Okay.  Had Reagan been shot yet?  Had Gerald Ford.  Yeah.  We're going to inch our way through the decade.  I know he doesn't have a lot left.  Reagan was shot when I was in high school. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, stop.  I swear to God.  Was he?  Yeah.  Well, that happened right around the same time.  In 81, I think.  That was a weird period, yeah.  Let's go back to the clip.  Easy.  Well, did you?  Honestly, no.  I never got into collar shirts.  You didn't?  You will not see me in a collar shirt very often.  Yeah.  This guy's a rock and roller.  Because my neck is too thick.  I got a scrawny little chicken neck.  You might be a child of the 80s if you know by heart the words any Weird Al Yankovic song.  Yes.  That's scary.  Hard to even admit to that.  How about this one?  The Brady Bunch movie brought back.  Oh, Anthony.  I'm a hole. 
[01:41:30]  Look at Anthony.  I'm a hole.  Anthony's selling that one.  Hard to even admit to that.  I'm a hole.  Paging Mr. Herman.  Mr. Herman, you have a phone call at the front desk.  That was great.  What a fucking team player he was.  No wonder you guys got here.  Let's hear that again.  That is support right there.  Wow.  This is brutal.  Having Bill here is really bad.  I can't get over the pot laugh.  Why?  1997.  I was already seven years clean from fucking pot and coke. 
[01:42:00]  And I'm making believe I'm a fucking druggie.  Dude, how much of a psycho were you when you were wired?  I never really liked it.  Yeah.  I never liked it.  I could look at you.  You're the same way?  No way.  No, I never fucked with that.  Oh, you never even fucked with it?  No, I never tried it.  No way.  I never really.  No, I'm a Len Bias kid.  I saw him.  That was the big rumor was, he did it once and he died.  That's all you needed to hear.  Yeah.  So I was like, all right.  I'm not messing with that.  I didn't like it as much as I thought I did, I think. 
[01:42:30]  I was done by 89 on that.  Well, considering your radio career started with a lie, I don't know if I'm believing this either.  Yeah, I wasn't into that.  I just don't.  Pot, yeah, 90.  New Year's 90.  That's fucking hilarious.  Well, you were probably too young in the 80s to smoke pot.  Sure.  Well, if you were 11, just growing up.  I was smoking candy cigarettes probably at that age.  I haven't smoked pot in 20 years.  What year is this?  I gotta start smoking pot again.  It's 21.  It's time. 
[01:43:00]  Art, the worst any weird Al Yankovic song.  Yes.  That's scary.  Hard to even admit to that.  How about this one?  The Brady Bunch movie brought back.  Cool memories.  Cool memories.  Yes.  One more.  You might be a child of the 80s.  If three words, Atari, Intellivision, and Coleco.  Oh, Coleco.  Coleco, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I remember those.  That was all we had.  We didn't have computers and, you know, stuff like that growing up in the 80s.  Wait.  Growing up in the 80s.  Wait.  What?  Your parents bought it for you and you didn't buy it for yourself.  This is so fucking big. 
[01:43:30]  You were writing code in the fucking 80s.  Also, Ron.  Also, current day Anthony.  I remember having the ENIAC computer.  Yeah.  Also, current day Anthony corrected me from 1997.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was kind of creepy.  I know.  That was weird.  I like that that just repeats key phrases and key words.  That's all I did.  It's really funny.  I had no clue what I was doing there.  Like you were fresh out of broadcasting school.  Fresh out of broadcasting school.  Fresh out.  I was like...  I had no...  I had no idea why I was there, what I should be doing. 
[01:44:00]  It was very scary.  And the very end of the clip, Ant's trying to put up this facade for everybody where he  says, yeah, we didn't have any of that stuff growing up.  Growing up.  Yeah.  He can't admit that he...  Yeah, I couldn't really dive into the lies.  In your house is where you have it, not in your parents' house.  Growing up.  Not in the 80s.  Just growing up.  Growing up.  When was the big...  Shut up, Sam.  What?  When was the big watershed moment where you guys just had a conversation? 
[01:44:30]  Oh, we remember that, actually.  We can't do this anymore.  It was a drive home.  Yeah.  Yeah, we always had the drive home conversation.  It was one of the drive homes.  We said, you know, fuck this shit.  Let's just talk about whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  Well, because you don't get the luxury of doing whatever the fuck you want.  You do kind of have to listen to people until you make a name for yourself.  So we were kind of, we were just playing the game, I guess.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And then one day we're like, fuck this.  What gives a fuck about this shit?  Let's talk about whatever, you know, pops in our heads.  Yeah.  And just getting comfortable there, for me at least, getting comfortable is so important. 
[01:45:00]  So important.  So important.  So important.  So it's important to be comfortable.  It's important to be comfortable.  Paging Mr. Herman.  You fucking asshole.  Paging Mr. Herman.  Mr. Herman, you have a telephone call at the front desk.  That was hilarious.  He's looking around.  All right.  So that's it, I guess.  There you go.  The end of October.  I didn't think it was that bad.  The end.  That was quick.  Sam.  I would think Sam would have come up with a few more clips. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  That's not.  That's not the end.  There's several more clips, actually.  Some more lengthy than others.  There's a picture of Obie from the 80s, right?  Yeah.  I'm surprised you're not wearing an IZON shirt.  They put a baby picture of Obie up on the Facebook site.  Good Lord.  Yeah.  That's me.  What year?  That's got to be.  That's.  Oh, so that's.  79.  Pre-pre-pre-moon landing.  Turn that sad and say pre-pre? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Dude, that's 64.  Kennedy's still alive with that one.  Look, he still has hope in his eyes.  Last time I had hope.  Oh, and I haven't finished listing things that were true in the 80s.  After some hilarity, they take some phone calls that probably aren't taped.  I wouldn't think they're taped, would you?  No, we did live phone calls, Sam.  You did?  Yeah, we took a live phone call, Sam.  Uh-huh.  Huh.  All right.  Maybe the phone's ringing because we got an interesting little phone topic today, Andy. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, we do.  I got a cool email that we're adding to, actually.  You might be a child of the 80s if is how it goes.  And, for example, the phrase, where's the beef, still doubles you over with laughter.  Jeez.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do.  That was never funny.  But that was a...  That was never funny.  That was a long laugh for that.  I just smoked pot.  Wow.  Because you guys smoked pot out there.  See, I relate to you.  You're agreeing that that phrase doubles you over with laughter. 
[01:47:00]  Because you guys are children of the 80s.  I want to say something here.  Because a pothead would probably laugh at that.  I want to say something here.  The original Where's the Beef commercials, when they first came on, were funny.  They were.  People found them funny.  Sure.  It was a great...  I never got it.  I never thought it was funny.  Where the old lady walked up and just yelled, like, where's the beef?  And the driving with the fucking...  She's driving and sliding in the car.  It was a funny...  People did kind of like those.  You were a little kid.  Of course you found it funny.  Yeah.  See, as a child of the 80s, I found things like that funny. 
[01:47:30]  And between watching Smurfs and other cartoons from the 80s.  Are you saying we weren't children of the 80s, Sam?  No, no.  I'm agreeing.  I'm listening to the show.  Are you willing to admit that I was a teenager in the 80s?  You might have turned 20 in 1980, making you 19.  Get the fuck out of here.  Dude, that baby picture is looking very Eisenhower administration.  That is right there in the industrial military complex speech.  Right there.  Yeah, yeah.  When was Sam born? 
[01:48:00]  1983.  Jesus.  So you were a child of the 80s.  I was a child of the 80s.  As were all of us, I guess.  I guess so.  We're not that far off.  He was a baby in the 80s.  Yeah, we're in the same spectrum.  You know why you like Where's the Beef?  We could both be children of the 80s.  Because your father was drinking and you were eating doilies at that age.  You had nothing to eat.  I had nothing to eat.  Pasta against the wall.  No, that was the 70s.  Or maybe the 60s.  I have no idea.  Can we negotiate?  That picture is great.  I think when that picture was clicked of Opie.  It's a big bun.  It's a very big bun. 
[01:48:30]  Big fluffy bun.  It's a very big fluffy bun.  Where's the beef?  Some hamburger places give you a lot less beef on a lot of bread.  They're all dead.  Where's the beef?  The old broad.  We serve a hamburger we modestly call the single.  It was just a bad line read.  Where's the beef?  Where's the beef?  At the time.  Awful acting, looking around.  I never found it funny.  I'm not trying to be a snob here.  We never found it funny.  Opie, when that picture was taken, right when the shutter clicked, I think at the same  time, a gentleman was saying, I shall not seek, nor shall I accept your nomination. 
[01:49:00]  No, that's not even true, because that's like 68.  There's no way.  That's 64.  You think Ickbenheim Berliner?  I think Mustang was just rolling off for the first time at the Ford company.  Ah, could be.  Their new car.  Ford Mustang.  That was probably, uh, 1970.  Oh, no.  You got out of an Edsel.  Go over with laughter.  Yeesh.  Remember that? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I do.  How about this one?  You might be a child of the 80s if, honestly, you remember when film critics raved that no  movie could ever possibly get better special effects than those in the movie Tron.  Tron.  Tron.  Oh, that was horrible.  I got one I just thought of.  What are you laughing at?  How about, uh, you know, your child of the 80s?  What were you laughing at?  Tron.  Tron.  Tron.  Tron.  Tron.  And you think it's going to go somewhere with a bit, and then all you get is, that  was horrible. 
[01:50:00]  Shut up.  Dude, all this just sounds like all my early stand-up tapes were so bad.  You basically, you sideswipe funny.  You get a little close to it, and then you just keep going.  Yeah, and then just kind of knock it off and hope for the best down the road.  Yeah, a little paint on the side of your car, that's all you get.  Hope down the road, you straighten it out.  I want to hear some of your old tapes, though.  No effing, no way.  No?  It's not easy.  I have...  Why not?  Do you at least have one example you could give us right now?  I get enough, like, oh my god, dude, just what I was wearing. 
[01:50:30]  Really?  I have one, I am wearing, like, navy blue Dockers.  Okay.  With black shoes, no belt, and then a striped shirt that's like pea soup green and navy blue.  Wow.  And I have a big afro.  A big red afro.  A big afro, and I'm too afraid to take the mic out of the mic stand, so, but I'm holding  on to it for dear life, and I have the most clever, douchey jokes you ever heard in your 
[01:51:00]  life, dude.  They're horrible.  I play it.  Anybody who comes over to my house, if they ever do my podcast, I'll show it to them, and  then I did it for Nick Swartzen one time, and they're just, yeah, it's just over.  They're like, oh my god.  That bad?  I got one of me bombing on local cable, like, you know, some cable access show.  It was like my first TV gig.  It was, I can't even remember the jokes.  They were just horrible. 
[01:51:30]  We got to see and hear that, man.  That's a great, that's a great, look at the velour shirt I was wearing as a young child.  That's you, Anthony?  That's me in kindergarten.  That's my kindergarten picture.  You can see the tang on the side of your lips.  That's 69.  Side of your mouth, I should say.  Keep going.  But, uh, you know, you're a child of the 80s, if you remember Ronald Reagan speaking coherently.  Very good.  Oh, no, don't do it.  Go AF, who's this?  It's Tom. 
[01:52:00]  Tom, what do you got?  All right, you know you were born in the 80s.  You can think Philip Michael Thomas is a celebrity.  I got another one.  I got two words for you.  A quiet riot.  Well, Philip Michael Thomas was the black dude from Miami Vice.  That got two big laughs out of you guys.  Yeah, it was terrific.  Black dude.  Then I had to tell everyone he was the black dude.  Then I had to tell everyone he was the black dude from Miami Vice.  You also have to, I enjoy, for instance, the transition between, for some reason, you guys talking and then you answering the phone. 
[01:52:30]  Seamless.  It was seamless.  It sounds like it happened at two different times.  It was seamless.  Even though it was a live call.  Michael Thomas was the black dude from Miami Vice.  That's nice, Rico.  Very good.  AF, who's this?  Hey, Derek.  How's it going?  Good, Eric.  What do you got?  When wearing leather pants were cool.  Very good.  Wait, wait.  The leather pants had to have about 100 different zippers on it, too.  You had to have the zipper near the ankle.  You were really cool if you had the leather parachute pants.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, take it easy.  You guys are doing a great job.  Thanks.  I just, I don't know why you're laughing at what these guys are saying.  Very good.  Very good.  I just zoned out there.  What happened?  I don't know why you're laughing at what these people are saying.  Like, leather pants.  You're like, yeah.  I don't know why.  I don't know either.  I would never laugh at that.  I don't know.  It's 1997.  But it wasn't even a joke.  The guy wasn't even joking.  He was just making a point.  Bill, is that your afro?  There you go.  Oh, shit. 
[01:53:30]  You look like Montgomery from Fame.  That's where he tells Ralph Garci he's in love with him.  That's way back college.  That's me on WERS.  That's the Simply Red guy.  Yeah.  I gave that one to the Boston Globe.  That's haunted me ever since.  Fuck.  Wow.  Damn.  It's not even funny.  It's just, wow.  Jesus.  Yeah, we're just looking at it like, oh.  No, I didn't realize your hair could do that.  Was that the highest you got it?  Yeah.  That was me in my rebel, no pussy college days. 
[01:54:00]  See, Sam, cut your hair.  I like my hair.  You're going to look back.  You're doing like a Bill Burr thing.  You're going to look back like this, though.  It's horrible.  Yeah, just cut it.  It's time.  You're going to go, what was I thinking?  When I'm doing Child of the 2000s bits.  What a cock.  That's what a cock he is.  Yeah, look at me.  Oh, I got some hope there.  There's a lot of hope.  The douche-o-meter is officially pegged. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I know.  The fans are really enjoying this.  You didn't like the very good, Sam?  You don't like the way you said that?  Yeah, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Not going to do it.  It's almost Dana Carvey there.  Will in Houston.  I like how Opie laughs at the hilarious joke, then explains it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, this is important.  No business being here.  You're questioning your phone.  I like your excitement.  You can hear your excitement that people are actually calling in.  Like, it's going good.  I don't care what somebody said.  Yeah, you remember salami. 
[01:55:00]  Salami.  Salami.  Yeah, salami.  Remember salami?  Nobody eats that anymore.  No.  As long as shitty calls are still going through, they'll do this all afternoon.  And that's what we did.  Oh, yes.  Today, we're on a little subject called, you might be a child of the 80s if.  All right, let me give you an example.  You might be a child of the 80s if you ever dressed to emulate a person you saw in either  a Duran Duran, Madonna, or Cyndi Lauper video. 
[01:55:30]  Yikes.  Never admit to that.  Never.  You might be a child of the 80s.  No, no, I don't admit to anything.  The Al Yankovic lyrics, this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God, that's when my hair started turning.  I didn't know what to do.  A shotgun to the fucking mouth would have been appropriate.  Dude, Jesus.  Did you have red hair?  My hair was very blondish when I was a kid.  And then it turned out reddish brown.  Holy shit.  And, yeah.  That's 71.  That's not the 80s.  That's 1971, right? 
[01:56:00]  Come on, that's in the middle of the 80s.  That's the 80s.  That's the official, the Beatles just broke up.  Let it be.  You got the let it be one.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that's when Joshua Tree came out.  Yeah.  That's the mid-80s.  Can you tell?  The caption is, I would have thrown spaghetti at your faggoty ass, too.  But, yeah, no, that's not even, I mean, the 80s are like, this kid is looking like, imagine what's going to happen in the 80s.  Fuck you, Sam. 
[01:56:30]  That's how not a child of the 80s he is.  That could be in the 80s.  No, no.  It's an impossibility.  No, that could be in the 80s.  It's an impossibility.  I'm holding on to this.  I was listening to The Clash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you were.  It was great.  Yeah.  Now, admit to that.  Never.  You might be a child of the 80s if your hair, oh, this is a good one, your hair at some point in time in the 80s became something which can only be described by the phrase,  I was experimenting.  Remember, it was huge. 
[01:57:00]  Girl.  Dude, you sound like you're having the time of your life on this show.  Cool.  Inside, I was crying.  Happy to be there.  Hey, can I tell you, too?  Inside, I was crying.  I didn't even think you were.  I think you were just completely nervous that you were going to blow this gig.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't in an attic.  That's fair.  I was happy.  I was not in an attic, so I was just like, this is the best place ever.  And I was fully expecting to be back in the attic.  I've got to be honest with you.  And you should have been after hearing this.  Exactly.  I thought you said I was not even an attic. 
[01:57:30]  No, no, I wasn't in the attic.  Of course you was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I couldn't deal with the thought that I was going to go back to knocking 10.  Yeah, we were extremely nervous.  It was a big afternoon drive gig.  If I was laughing, everybody else must have been.  We were a lot older than our audience.  But they weren't saying funny things.  Like, I wouldn't mind if you were laughing at a couple of jokes that weren't good, but  you just laughed at anything that was from the 80s.  Like, you know what I mean?  If you remember, 1983. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, it was before 84.  That's stupid.  Yes, there's no reason to laugh.  No, because they're not jokes.  Hey, you remember that?  Yeah, I do.  The other thing that you guys were told was not only to not act your age, but to keep  it local.  Yes, yes.  So I hope that everybody's prepared for Opie, the radio, the consummate broadcast professional,  to bring in that local angle.  The local angle.  Local flavor.  During the air checks, they used to tell us all the time, look, you know, yeah, I like 
[01:58:30]  what you're doing.  But you know what?  You've got to make it a little more local, guys.  Just to remind the audience that you grew up in Boston in the 80s.  I did not do that.  You didn't, you acted like you were from Boston.  No.  No, you didn't.  No.  You brought in the local angle.  I got to hear this.  Oh, no.  I was experimenting.  Remember, it was huge.  Girls' hair was huge.  Oh, it was so high.  They had the peacock look. 
[01:59:00]  Actually, the 80s look hasn't left Revere yet.  No.  I think Revere is the only town in America that still has the 80s hair work.  I've never been to Revere in my life.  Yeah, someone told you that.  There you go.  I've never been there.  Wow.  No, I don't even think I've ever driven through Revere.  Wow.  But you're from Boston and grew up in the 80s.  I couldn't point out Revere in a map.  And that was the hackiest reference.  Oh, was it?  In stand-up.  That was the one that you said in the Boston area.  Like, who's this guy from Revere?  Yep.  All right, so someone obviously told me that. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, that's the hacky fucking...  But you can hear it in him that he has no idea what Revere is, where it is.  He's just throwing it out there.  Is that good?  It's local, right?  Almost like someone's talking in an earpiece, and he's trying to get past through levels  of security.  What's the password?  Revere.  Revere.  Revere.  Yes.  Who had it?  Would be the hack town.  Only town in America that still has the 80s hair working, where it's that peacock look.  It's really high on top, but real flat. 
[02:00:00]  If they turn sideways, they only have like an inch of hair that goes all over.  Yeah, they were just getting height, pure height.  And then they'd take a little wisp of like waterfall bangs that would come down and like  an awning.  It was like a front awning.  What the hell were they thinking?  That still happens in Revere.  That's the sad part.  AF.  Hey.  That was great.  You went back to Revere again.  Yeah.  But that was a table pounding.  Like, he said like, yeah, it's just an inch and you, I hear.  You heard that, didn't you?  I sure did.  Yeah.  Bill was right.  They did go.  They reminded everybody. 
[02:00:30]  Revere.  Revere.  Local.  Massachusetts.  That's going to be great for the air check.  They're going to say, yeah, you went local.  I like that.  Yeah.  It's just two guys from Massachusetts who grew up in the 80s.  Yep.  Just relating to the other kids.  Yeah.  They couldn't be less like their listeners.  Abuse.  And I like this part.  AF.  Hey.  Hi.  I'm a child of the 80s that remembers when Def Leppet's drummer had two arms.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Now we're talking. 
[02:01:00]  That's some excitement.  And the one thing, and here's the annoying part.  That was the funny joke that you guys don't laugh at.  You go, yeah.  I know.  Like, that was, you should have laughed at that.  That's his inner radio child screaming out, this is the direction I really want to go  in.  As he said, they got Revere.  Like, Revere.  Revere.  This is what this makes, reminds me of that cripple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right, though.  Why can't I do that?  Fuck, Bill in a way is right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think.  I want to make fun of amputees, not talk about this crap.  Yeah, I don't think this. 
[02:01:30]  I don't actually don't.  I don't think you're right, Bill.  I don't think it's this bad.  I don't think it's that bad.  You're breaking it down.  Oh, it's so bad.  Let me go to Kyle in Boston.  Kyle.  Hey, as hacky as that Revere line was, it's still fucking true.  There you go.  It's true.  It is.  True doesn't make it.  There you go.  I'm hacky, though.  There you go.  I mean, the point is that you're liars.  It's not what you're telling the truth.  You're lying.  Why are we liars, Sam?  Liars.  Why are we liars?  We really are.  I got a question.  Who came up with the idea for Opie and Anthony's demented world and Anthony pointing to the world 
[02:02:00]  punch it?  And if I notice, the two of you are in that world and you still want to destroy it.  Holy shit.  Look at Anthony's ponytail.  I didn't even see that.  It's two.  I have like one on one side, one on the other, and one on top.  Ponytails.  So it's like this big, fluffy poodle head.  You look like you're in Spirogyra.  It's crazy, right?  Like when I was a kid.  And then I got rubber bands in my hair for some reason.  Yeah, yeah.  Opie's got like...  It was the first time we ever had a makeup artist, and that's what they discovered. 
[02:02:30]  Wow.  I don't think they were artists.  And you guys were just like happy to be there.  Hey, why not?  Cool.  You're going to do our hair?  It's a demented world, isn't it?  We're doing a photo shoot today.  It's demented.  It's crazy.  I think it was our first photo shoot, right?  Opie, get mad at the world in this one.  Get mad at the world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why would we punch our world?  Because that's basically what we're saying.  You're demented.  It's demented.  It's like bizarro, but different.  I hope nobody can tell that we're liars in this picture.  Shut up.  Is that what we're thinking?  Yeah.  I hope our fucking... 
[02:03:00]  Why does that picture say we're liars?  I just hope nobody can tell that we're massive phonies.  That's why they had Anthony put his arm up so he couldn't tell he was already in his 40s.  Come on.  I was not.  I will not take that.  Because there was nothing about you guys that was like, you didn't really look like that.  Like, you guys didn't do your hair like that normally.  No.  You aren't crazy wild guys.  You're probably nice dudes.  I'm out of my mind wild.  I'm wearing a Lollapalooza shirt.  You're right.  And that.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's... 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're just trying.  Because the kids would be wearing their Lollapalooza shirts.  Of course they would.  By the way, I had that exact same t-shirt, and I used to wear it thinking I was out of control.  But I was also in 8th grade or 7th grade at the time.  Who wasn't?  Right.  So were you now that I think of that.  In Boston.  We all fucking were children of the 80s.  Right.  That could be the best of the day.  That could be the direction my career could go in.  That's what I want to do. 
[02:04:00]  Marblehead.  Speaking of flash dance, remember when all the girls of the 80s thought they were cool  because they'd wear the leg warmers to school?  Oh, my God.  Who did ya there?  That was Anthony's.  I did a ya, but he did his better.  Who was doing the horrific pothead voice right there?  Hey, that's what I'm trying to tell you.  Let's play that again.  Remember when they were the leg warmers, man?  And how long had it been since you had smoked pot?  90.  So that's seven years since you had smoked pot. 
[02:04:30]  But you sound like Gabe's not here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seven years.  Yeah, but you had your clarity at 35 at seven years later.  I'm too old for this.  I really am.  This is so bad.  You're not from Boston.  You don't smoke pot.  And you weren't a child of the 80s.  Sam's over there just collecting lies.  The evidence.  That's why you reacted to that.  Just collecting lies.  Yeah.  At this point, I haven't had a drug in my body for 21 years. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, let's hear that clip again.  That's a good point.  I don't know how to do it, though.  It's a flash dance.  Speaking of flash dance, remember when all the girls in the 80s thought they were cool  because they'd wear the leg warmers to school?  Yeah.  I like how you fucked it up, too.  He goes, wear the leg warmers.  Lego warmers.  Lego warmers.  Yeah!  Revere, Marblehead, Worcester. 
[02:05:30]  I think we wrote downtowns before we went on the air.  For the first year, we were writing shit down.  I think you're right.  I think towns were written down.  Somebody on the Opie and Anthony in 1997 Facebook page just posted a picture of two  confused old men with the caption, metaphorical picture of ONA trying to relate to their listeners.  This isn't funny.  Yes, it is.  Oh, Jesus.  You might be a child of the 80s if you're excited to watch Family Ties. 
[02:06:00]  This is nothing funny.  Family Ties.  Yes, I would have to reiterate.  Chiming in douche.  No reason.  Almost done.  Painful.  That was towards the end of your any time.  Any time.  More things that happen in the 80s than the phone system gets screwed up or Opie can't get  the pre-recorded call to play.  It's one or the other.  I can't tell.  See, you say that the phone system is screwed up, but then I'm factoring in that you guys 
[02:06:30]  were liars, so I'm assuming that you're playing pre-taped calls and that that isn't what's  not working.  You can't figure out how to push play.  How could you just factor that in?  I'm not going to admit to any lies today, Sam, but you're keeping track over there.  Yeah.  What are we lying about?  Well, so far, I feel that you've lied completely about your age growing up in the 80s.  You're lying about being from Boston.  About what they think is funny.  You're lying about what you think is funny because those jokes weren't funny. 
[02:07:00]  You're lying about smoking pot.  You're trying to do the voice.  So, so far, I've got five huge lies.  Lying about the kind of show that they want to be doing.  Lying that they're enjoying themselves.  I like how Bill pointed out the fucking amputee thing because you're so right.  Yeah, you're like, please, more people say stuff like that so I can do stuff like that.  And I don't know why we couldn't do it ourselves.  Like, just say, ah, fuck it.  Well, we did, finally.  But at that point, go, you know what?  Fuck it.  We want to hear more about this demented fucking weird shit. 
[02:07:30]  I'm going to punch Sam in the head.  I like Sam listing the lies.  Sam's now writing a list of all of our lies from...  All right, what have we got on the lie list so far again?  We're from Boston.  We grew up in the 80s.  Yes.  We think our listeners are funny.  Yes.  We like doing this type of radio.  Yes.  Everything's funny.  Our calls aren't recorded.  We smoke pot.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  That phony dialogue, we don't know the mics are on. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yes.  There's another one.  Oh, we didn't stop smoking pot.  We might get a double digits here.  Seven years ago.  Well, at this point, Jesus.  Seven years ago.  The mics are off.  Yeah, that's eight lies.  Yeah, that's a lot of lies.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  I got to actually make it a smaller font so we can fit it all on one thing.  Also, today on the show, we're doing the phone, or you might be a child of the 80s,  if... 
[02:08:30]  And we got a couple of good ones coming in here.  Might be a child of the 80s, if you know who shot J.R.  Mm, that's a good one.  That is a very good one.  You might be a child of the 80s.  What was good about it?  Nothing.  I had no idea why I said that, Jim.  I throw myself on the mercy of you fucking pricks.  Another lie.  Opie got this from an email, as opposed to just reading it from a website.  Fuck, yes.  From Prep Burger.  Prep Burger or something.  Bitboard.  I like how Anthony's feigned excitement.  He went, mmm.  Mmm.  Ah, not only is it a good one, it's interesting. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Yes, I do remember that as a child of the 80s.  Actually, that might be one of the more honest moments you have, because you couldn't even  sell it with a fake laugh.  You're just like, mmm.  That was English language.  I don't know if people give a fuck about this, but when I was at BAB and then Ann was at  BAB with me for a little while there, we were doing way edgier stuff than this.  Yeah, because it was like 7 at midnight.  We had naked girls being spanked.  All sorts of crazy shit. 
[02:09:30]  So we went backwards.  What, you had naked girls being spanked?  Jesus, you guys were out there.  It was way before, you know, now every fucking show has done it, but what I'm saying is naked  girls doing some pretty crazy shit, and then we took a step backwards to take this job.  Oh, wow.  So that's even worse, huh?  Because they had a lot more hands-on shit with us at AF than we had at BAB.  That's what he's trying to say.  Yeah, yeah.  They had a lot more hands-on money.  Hands-on money.  To pay us.  And the creative level of the money was the money.  But then, this is what's confusing.  This is confusing even to me. 
[02:10:00]  We do have video of, like, Ant in a shower with fucking girls, you know, showering off  from debauchery that was happening in the studio.  This was before we fucking realized we got to turn this ship around.  We got to do something.  How far out to sea did you get?  Very far.  Very far before we decided to turn around.  And see if other men's cum.  Jesus Christ.  That's a good one.  That is a very good one.  You might be a child of the 80s.  If all skate, change directions, mean something to you. 
[02:10:30]  All skate, remember that?  All skate.  In the skating rink.  Yes.  All skate, couple zone.  You can hear our Boston accents.  That is a 70s reference.  I didn't get that.  It really is.  It really is a 70s reference.  What?  That's roller boogie.  That's 76.  What are you talking about?  Roller skating rinks.  Well, that's why Ant got excited and went, ooh.  Yeah.  Did I?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Hey.  You think they're giving themselves away with the wrong one?  If you remember, separate water fountains.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, that's what someone, no, somebody calls in with something racist and then Anthony goes, 
[02:11:00]  yeah.  That's the direction.  Well, we can all agree.  You can hear the Boston accents, Sam.  You guys aren't from Boston.  You're faking it.  You can hear the Boston accents, right?  I'll give you credit for being phonies and liars.  As a matter of fact, I'll add that to the list.  Remember that?  All skate.  In the skating rink.  Yes.  All skate, couples only.  And then the changed directions used to freak everyone out.  Yeah.  They'd start falling and start trying to hit each other.  Yeah.  Hitting each other, trying to turn around.  You know what I know? 
[02:11:30]  You're a child of the 80s.  If the at key on any keyboard just didn't mean anything to you.  It didn't mean anything in the 80s.  Very good.  Now it's very important.  Yes.  You might be a child of the 80s if you own a pair of brain books.  Please go back to Anthony.  Why?  I can't.  Why?  Yeah.  Let us off the hook, Bill.  Why, Bill?  Why?  Why are you doing this to me?  Let us off the hook, please.  Ha ha.  Let's talk about you and Jimmy Fallon.  You know how every time I sit there and you guys are like, okay, this could be funny.  You guys go right up to funny and then you fucking, you turn it back around again. 
[02:12:00]  We were scared.  We were scared.  We were.  Okay, I can't make fun of you.  You just totally admit to it.  You know, Bill.  We were scared.  You know, being frightened isn't a funny fucking thing, man.  The Opie and Anthony show from 1997 just posted, whoever's running this Facebook page just posted,  Brother Mans, Brother Mans, why is everyone crashing our site?  If this keeps up, we're going to have to block all posts.  Chwa!  Chwa!  Chwa! 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  I'll have the last laugh when I start fucking printing up Brother Man, Brother Man t-shirts.  And there's the Royal Flush cover.  Look, we're playing poker in a tournament.  Brother Man, Brother Man is his catchphrase.  So what's up, Brother Man?  Shut up, Bill.  He used to try to create catchphrases.  You know what, Opie?  I like you too much to even look at you.  After here, I'm embarrassed for you.  Just let me be today.  Brother Man.  You want to look at the station CD we were part of? 
[02:13:00]  You love the Dementor World cover.  This was called Royal Flush.  That's not bad.  We're all just hanging around, playing poker, having a good time.  That's not bad at all.  People still do that.  Where's the urinal one?  Was that part of Royal Flush?  Yeah, it had to be.  There's an alternate cover or something.  We're all at the urinal.  Yeah.  There's nothing to say about that.  There honestly is nothing really wrong with that.  How else do you get ten guys in a photo? 
[02:13:30]  What are you supposed to be doing?  That looks like a bad rock album in the 70s.  Is it as bad as that joke?  Nothing?  No, you're right.  It does.  Opie and Anthony just don't remember the 70s.  No, no.  It was well before.  Tiny little babies.  They grew up in the 70s.  There's some great acoustic performances and then real shitty comedy in between the songs.  I mean, really bad.  Really fucking bad.  What are some of the artists on this one?  Everclear, Tracy Bonham, Local Age, Our Lady Peace, Cake, Mighty Joe Plum, and the WAAF Air Staff. 
[02:14:00]  The Knicks did not do anything in the 80s.  Very good.  Now it's very important.  Yes.  You might be a child of the 80s if you owned a pair of rainbow suspenders just like Mork used to wear.  It's embarrassing.  What am I fucking passing up?  And one more real fast.  You might be a child of the 80s.  Oh, man.  I actually did this one.  You sat with your friends on a Friday night and dialed 867-5309 to see if Jenny would answer.  You did that? 
[02:14:30]  Did you do that?  You were an adult.  I'm officially going to admit a lie.  I never did that.  Then why did you say you did?  Add it to the list.  But I'm officially not going to admit that.  I never did that.  Why did you tell people that you did?  You want to be cool?  The cool kids did?  Even though you weren't a kid in the 80s?  People now are just writing, Opie's a liar.  A huge liar.  But Ant is just as bad for enabling and just going along.  Opie knows what he's doing. 
[02:15:00]  I'm going to lie right along with him.  Could you guys look at each other while you were doing this show?  Oh, yeah.  We thought it was great.  For some reason, yeah.  They high-fived while every song was playing.  The bald-faced liar show?  Yes.  But who would ever think that would be cool to say on the radio?  That, yeah, man, I used to call the nomad.  I did that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What you got to do is I think when you listen to this kind of a show,  you got to get into that demented world.  You mean that, Bill? 
[02:15:30]  Look at the long leather fucking jacket I got, though.  That's cool, right?  And your tucked-in shirt.  Yeah.  I like the fact your shirt is tucked in.  Your braided belt.  I know.  By then, grunge had come in and nobody tucked their shirt.  Nobody did.  It's right there.  That's a nice hint.  Yeah.  None of the kids are tucking their shirt.  Shut up.  But you're trying to relate.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  There's a dead giveaway in that picture.  Of what?  Dead giveaway.  The crow's feet around your eyes? 
[02:16:00]  You asshole.  Do you have a wedding ring on?  Yes.  You do?  Oh, there it is.  What the fuck?  Wow.  Someone fucked up.  Yeah, you probably told people it was a mood ring.  That would be the 70s.  They told us to not admit we had girls.  That we were available.  Wow.  What a prize for the girls that was.  Jesus Christ.  And we were available.  Ah, this is so bad.  Oh, that was the Unusual Suspects cover, yeah. 
[02:16:30]  See, because we're unusual.  There it is.  What?  What now?  I'm trying to figure out what's hanging off your pants.  Is that like a shirt?  Oh, you got your hat buttoned to your belt buckle.  Because the kids were doing it.  Oh, no.  Sam can't get enough of this.  Sam is enjoying this a little too much.  Look at his head hanging from his belt buckle.  The adjustable man.  Now I get why.  Why did it take this to make you laugh, you cunt?  Oh, it's terrible. 
[02:17:00]  Dude, you were fucking lost.  You really were with that big stupid hat.  He's like some fucking aging ingenue.  Still trying to be the flavor of the month.  It's over.  You're old.  It's a second album cover.  His shirt is tucked in.  He's like a dork.  He's like Cheryl Teague in 1991.  His dorky shirt is tucked into his belted jeans.  What a set of balls.  Fucking hands in the pockets and true rock star fit. 
[02:17:30]  What a set of balls.  Holy shit, Sam.  These opportunities don't come up often.  Oh, that's fucking true.  I'm going for the gold.  The second album cover with his shirt tucked in.  Someone look it up.  Are the kids tucking their shirts in?  No.  Dude, even all the other old guys in that photo have their shirts untucked.  Everyone has their hands in their pockets.  Just a bunch of nerds.  Geeks.  That's fucking brutal.  I know that guy in the end didn't have a real name.  He had a nickname, whatever his name was. 
[02:18:00]  Rocco.  It was, yeah.  That was Rocco.  Rocco.  You just know, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the guy that used to come on after us, nighttime.  Every morning show has it.  And see, Hillman had to be the Santa Claus.  Yeah, yeah.  He's standing there.  Because Dave loved Hillman at all.  He's the guy.  You're going to be our leader in the photos.  Oh, my God.  Hillman's been there that long?  He's still there.  No, no.  Yeah, whenever I go to Boston, I go out to the show.  Then we'll shut up right there.  Yeah, actually.  I like that guy.  Why?  Did you guys have bad blood? 
[02:18:30]  I think he's hilarious.  I think he's a dick.  No, you don't like him?  Nope.  Too much personal shit.  What the fuck is that?  Tonk for Hooters on a billboard?  Dude.  Who's that guy?  Wait, who is that?  I was never on a billboard.  I was never on a billboard.  I can't confirm.  Who's that guy on the left?  I don't know.  That's you in drag.  Would you dress up in drag, Opie?  Oh, no.  No, I swear to God.  You promise?  Because that looks like Anthony and Opie in drag.  No, somebody fucking did something.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, and you're doing... 
[02:19:00]  There's Anthony.  Honk for Hooters.  It's probably...  No, I swear to you.  I've done...  I'll admit, I've done a lot of douchey things in this business, but I've never dressed like a fucking  woman for a promotion.  It's probably photoshopped.  It's probably something you've done on the side of the road and somebody photoshopped it.  Were we on a billboard at?  I don't remember that at all.  I don't remember that.  That's not saying much, though.  Honk for Hooters is pretty nuts, though.  It's crazy.  I like how you made the two O's in Hooters were like boobs.  That was really close.  Can you get that picture and blow it up a little bit?  Is that really me photoshopped? 
[02:19:30]  I don't know.  I can't tell.  I can't either.  Look.  Yeah, I would not fucking dress in drag for a dumb radio promotion.  Is this another lie?  Is this another lie?  I haven't confirmed another story.  It could be a huge lie.  Get in there.  No, it's not.  I swear.  I'm wearing a Patriots shirt.  Is that me?  I don't think that's him.  I don't think that's me.  Because he's got like a mullet.  No, it's not me.  It's not pulled back.  That's not him.  It's not you guys.  Okay, you told the truth for once.  That's totally Anthony.  That was scary.  I remember we duct taped our intern to a pole and left him there. 
[02:20:00]  Jesus Christ.  See right there.  You got right up to fireworks.  Fireworks.  You got right up to the funny.  It was funny.  I was just saying because we tied a kid to a tree and threw fireworks at him.  See?  You had the idea.  We actually duct taped him and took the ladder away so he was just fucking hanging from  a pole and we left him there and went home.  Okay.  That I remember.  I hope this wild guy doesn't spray that fire extinguisher at anyone.  I know.  All right.  Dude, you look like you're in Quiet Riot.  Yeah, I know.  Just like a nurse. 
[02:20:30]  It was really fast.  I guess we're done, Sam.  That's it.  Black Cadillac.  Look how pretty Opie was.  Now he's calling you pretty.  That's a pretty intense stare, though.  Well, he wanted to be, because Opie wanted to be a model, so when he was taking radio pictures,  he put on a model face, I think.  Shut up.  You told us you wanted to be a model.  Yeah.  So you're telling me...  I didn't want to be a model.  You were a model.  What was it about you that thought you would be a good model?  I was put in something when I was in Rochester.  A couple things that we don't want to talk about, because that goes back even further. 
[02:21:00]  No, the answer...  Look at that picture.  The answer is because he was delusional.  No, no, no.  Let's go back to that.  So what will you put in?  Some stuff.  Did you model bell-bottoms at 26?  I modeled a Coca-Cola t-shirt.  Oh, shit.  There it is.  Can we get some sound?  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no.  Please.  Bill hasn't seen it.  Why are you telling us it to me?  Because Bill's got to see it. 
[02:21:30]  Just want to see the Coca-Cola thing.  Phil is smiling now.  Wait till you hear this.  All right, go back.  Fuck.  No, I like this, because you're seeing all this shit you guys went through to get where  you're at.  This is actually cool.  Go ahead and spend it.  Get ready.  Hi, I'm Opie, a starving radio personality.  I need TV work.  Call me.  This number right here, okay?  Let's check out some video tape.  He just goes, ah. 
[02:22:00]  I know he's allowed.  There's a lot of rock rollers out there, like Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses.  Why don't you give us a call right now?  325-0500.  If you don't, I just might have to sing, and that's going to be ugly.  So give us a call.  325-0500.  Gabe, back to you.  Opie, thank you very much.  Don't threaten us like that.  We'd like to thank you.  Don't threaten us like that.  Hi, I'm Opie from WCMF.  You know, it's your life.  But if you mess around with drugs or alcohol, it's more than just your life you're hurting. 
[02:22:30]  Think about your family.  Pause that.  Think about your friends.  I was doing drugs at that point.  Exactly.  So you were lying again.  Exactly.  And you should be saying that every morning to your radio partner.  Because that was in the mid-80s.  All you were trying to, you were trying to just fill whatever role was open.  Whatever they would let you do on camera or on the air, you'd be that guy.  So I'm telling people not to drink or do drugs.  Dude, your baby face really saved you, though.  Yeah.  As far as this lie about your age. 
[02:23:00]  I know.  I always looked younger than I was.  So wait, Sam, you don't think that he cared about the message?  No.  You think that it was just camera time?  Opie had no integrity.  At least up until he came to New York.  I probably did coke that night after filming this PSA.  All you wanted to do was have somebody put a camera in front of your face.  There is no integrity whatsoever.  Just lies.  Are you done with that so we can move on?  No, there's another minute of it.  You wanted to watch the rest of it?  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, it's your life. 
[02:23:30]  But if you mess around with drugs or alcohol, it's more than just your life you're hurting.  Think about your family.  Think about your friends.  Coke boogers coming out of his nose.  So it'll be CMF and 31 care about you.  Let's hear some noise in here.  Come on, guys.  Yeah.  There's just little kids around you.  You're like, yeah, let's make some noise here.  I swear they are three-year-olds.  Yeah, but dude, I can't make fun of you for this because this is the bullshit that you have to crawl through. 
[02:24:00]  Nobody wants to do this gig ever.  That was local TV, Rochester, MDA, Telethon.  That was the sound of a man hating himself.  That was it right there.  I was hoping it would lead to something.  Not many years later, still doing radio.  By the way, how quickly did you think you were going to make it in this business?  Wow, that's a really good question.  I started at 23, and I go, you know, by the time I'm like 29, 30, I'll have my own show. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, that's about right.  That's about right.  Oops.  Yeah, yeah.  That wasn't oops.  That's about right.  33, I was sleeping on a futon.  Dead serious.  Not because I couldn't afford a bed, just my place was so fucking small I couldn't get one in there.  It sucks.  Oh, yes.  It really does just suck.  Chasing a dream.  Yeah.  Folks, want to put some money in the fishbowl?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, you little fucks.  Thank you very much.  What could you have been saying to her?  She's probably like, so how far do you live from here? 
[02:25:00]  And you're probably like, yeah, about an hour.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, where'd you get that mullet?  Sam, you're slacking.  I have to help you out?  Another shirt that's tucked in.  Why are you always tucking in your shirts for?  Those are the Coca-Cola shirts that you were doing for some kind of a commercial thing.  Yeah, when I talk about I could have been a model, this is what I'm referencing, by the way.  See, even that's not, I'm just joking about that, but some people.  What are you talking about?  Look at that hottie you're standing next to.  Huh?  Look at that hottie you're standing next to.  That was a, for Rochester, that was like a 10. 
[02:25:30]  God damn, a 10.  That's a 10 in Rochester.  I'm not even fucking lying.  She looks like a mom.  She was younger than me.  Tits are down by her waist.  She's just looking at her.  Look how low her tits are.  They're terrible.  I swear to you, she's in her 20s.  And she's looking up at Opie like, you're the coolest.  With his shirt tucked in.  You are enjoying.  Stone washed jeans.  Do you think this is a good modeling exhibition? 
[02:26:00]  The worst.  What I like about Opie here is he clearly knows what to do with his hands.  Because there's nothing more uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Hey.  Coke.  Glinging him around.  Are we done with this?  Did you want to see the rest?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Cool.  Cool.  I don't know.  Where did you get that spiky do?  Why did you realize that men would never be a part of your life?  Gosh, you're terrible, this one.  They couldn't find a, like a, like a, a better looking girl.  A non-pig. 
[02:26:30]  If you were a bottom in hardcore pornography, it wouldn't be as embarrassing.  Well, is that from the latter?  Yeah.  It's a.  Wow.  That was old.  That was us.  Yeah, that was us talking about the video.  Right.  Which is odd.  It should have just been the video.  Because I don't think the video itself was ever posted.  Really?  Oh, really?  Or it must have been posted somewhere and gotten taken down.  Yeah.  Because these are all fan videos.  There's no official.  Mm.  Whatever.  If you want to know, I was up on the ladder and I had to stay there until they raised a 
[02:27:00]  certain amount of money.  You had to stay up on a ladder, yeah.  I remember that.  Did you get down during the commercial breaks?  You liar.  You don't think you stayed up there the whole time?  No.  As soon as the camera was off, you just climbed right down and sat down on a chair.  I wasn't an asshole yet, so I probably stayed up on the ladder.  Here we go.  I actually did this one.  You sat with your friends on a Friday night and dialed 867-5309 to see if Jenny would  answer.  Ah.  You did not.  Is Jenny there? 
[02:27:30]  But why on a Friday night?  Wouldn't that be like a Tuesday night?  Yeah.  What would you make a night of that for?  Even if she answered?  Who cares?  Yeah, a whole fucking night, right?  She'd answer and you'd go ahead.  Wouldn't you just call it once and that was it?  The bit's over?  Jimmy, he was adding layers to the comedy.  Yeah, I guess so.  On a Friday night.  Plus, I mean, you never did it to start with.  So, he wouldn't have any experience to draw from.  Is that when the kids did it?  Yeah.  You're trying to...  Because kids hang out on Friday nights, Jim.  All the kids that are listening, I hear they hang out on Fridays now. 
[02:28:00]  Basically, being a child of the 80s, you weren't old enough to drink yet, so you had to find  some fun things to do at home.  You weren't old enough to drink yet.  Come on.  Yes, you were.  One of these days, I'll show you my old stand.  There's no...  You have to.  There's no way I would put it out there.  It's really uncomfortable.  You really don't have to.  You don't have to put yourself through this excruciating shit.  You just choose to.  Yeah, why do we?  I don't know why we do, but...  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Because there's something satisfying about we shit on everybody, so it's fun to kind of...  Get shit on?  Yeah, man.  Come full through.  Come full through it.  It's humiliating.  That was a good prank call in the 80s.  Yeah.  It's humiliating.  Oh, you hear the dead space there?  That was supposed to be comedy.  Oh, that was supposed to be a...  That was supposed to be a...  A phone call, right?  Going with Bill's thing.  Yeah, there's plenty of room for comedy jokes.  Some laughter and jocularity.  I know what happened there.  No comedy, so now I'm going to blame it on the phone. 
[02:29:00]  It's like, oh, fuck, something's going on here.  But there was supposed to be comedy.  I actually thought that was the best piece of the segment so far.  Listen, it's your concept, Bill, where we got close and then said, oh, no, we can't do this.  Listen, that was a good prank call in the 80s.  The phone system screwed up.  All right.  Oh, the phone system is screwed up.  Another lie, right?  It's a lie.  He's sitting there trying to push play and make sure the pot is up on the phone call that has been recorded. 
[02:29:30]  But I think it goes deeper than that.  I think we had no comedy there.  And then we both realized how awkward it was.  So you panicked.  Panicked and blamed it on a technical problem.  Dude, that just made me nervous.  Like, you guys, up until then, you were spitballing, you're throwing stuff out.  So even if it sucks, there's not the dreaded silence of comedy.  That was nerve-wracking right there.  But see, the other thing, this is something we saved from 1997.  I think you were hitting, though.  I think you were hitting the button. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, that sounds like something wasn't going on.  Trying to get the phone thing played, yeah.  Fair enough.  So maybe that's not a lie, Sam.  No, yes, it is.  The phone system screwed up.  Because the phone system isn't.  AF!  Hey, I got one for you.  Let's hear it.  You might be a child of the 80s if you remember carrying a piece of cardboard to school to breakdance on.  Oh, man.  Spinning on your head.  Yeah.  Good addition.  With the boombox that two people had to carry at one time.  40 D batteries. 
[02:30:30]  Good job, dude.  I'm so happy.  I hate the forced jocularity.  Like, everybody's just having a fucking laugh party.  If you guys both wanted to call that guy a douche, because of the way he said it.  If you remember bringing a piece of cardboard to breakdance on, you would have been like, too long, asshole.  I was just thinking, good thing you got those phones working.  You got that thing on the air.  Immediately.  Yeah.  Immediately.  Phones not working.  Call her, hi.  Yeah.  And it's amazing that these callers have such bad jokes, but they're so good with timing on the air. 
[02:31:00]  Making sure everything's quick and to the point.  Nice and tight.  Anthony, let's see if that sounds distracted during this.  Like, you're fucking online trading, and you're just, like, repeating keyphrases, like when a chick is yelling at you.  Fucking spin on your head.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  And then we go into, I'm so happy.  No, we weren't.  No.  No.  We were so confused.  All right.  I've had enough.  There we go.  We got one more clip. 
[02:31:30]  Because Anthony has some new sound effects.  Oh, no.  Come on, man.  Don't end with me.  Luckily, there's a fact about the...  I love how he pulls his hat down on the radio, as if anybody can see him.  No, because I can't look at you guys.  That's all right.  It's so embarrassing.  I'm just going to stare right into your eyes, Anthony.  No, please, Joe.  Luckily, there's a fax about the 80s that segs into them nicely.  Oh, good.  See, this clip, it just left me befuddled, because you teased that Anthony had new sound effects to do.  Then you read the fax, and then you acted as if the sound effects organically... 
[02:32:00]  You already announced that you...  Oh, shit.  I didn't even understand what you were going for.  We're looking at 1997.  That's right.  ...to conclude Jacktober, for the people just tuning in.  Here's the final track, thank God.  That's funny.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks. 
[02:32:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Anthony's got a couple new sound effects for you.  In a second, though, okay?  We're doing a really cool photo today.  We're doing...  I'm teasing a sound effect?  No, but Anthony's going, yeah.  And Opie's relating to the listener as if he's talking right to them by saying, in a few minutes, okay?  Because he's not saying, Ant, is that okay with you?  He's asking the listener, okay?  I can't take this.  By the way, the Opie and Anthony show from 1997 Facebook page is in phase two. 
[02:33:00]  The 1997 Opie and Anthony show has closed people posting on their wall, so now it's just their postings that you can post on.  Their latest one is, today we're asking our listeners, what makes you a child of the 80s?  Just like your favorite shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Your favorite shock jocks, great.  You weren't children in the 80s.  That's fantastic.  That's great.  I was a teenager in the 80s, Sam.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, it's joyless.  Thanks for you.  In a second, though, okay?  Yeah.  We're doing a really cool phoner today.  We're doing...  You might be a child of the 80s if...  And you fill in the blank.  You might be a child of the 80s if you had a ringside seat for Luke and Laura's wedding on General Hospital.  Oh.  Remember that fiasco?  You might be a child of the 80s if you spent endless nights dreaming about being the bionic woman or Wonder Woman or the $6 million man.  Got a fax here from some guys. 
[02:34:00]  That's all 70s shows.  Those are all shows from the 70s.  You just don't remember...  What the fuck is that about?  That's why your lie is unraveling.  You know all the words to the Partridge family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sound effects coming up in two minutes, guys.  Sound effects.  This is painful.  Our lies are falling apart, Sam.  Yes, because you're thinking of things that...  You're like, okay, well, that occurred a while ago.  I mean, I wasn't a kid, but I wasn't a kid in the 80s either, so... 
[02:34:30]  You remember Evil Knievel's big jump over the Snake River Canyon.  He thought a Ford Pento was a safe car.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Yeah, the listening...  Anthony, you got some sound effects for that one?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Yeah!  At that point, the listeners are like, what is a bionic...  What shows are they talking about?  I never watched any of those.  You grew up on Hogan's Heroes, you fucking liar.  F Troop.  F Troop, yes.  I'm the worst. 
[02:35:00]  The listeners are just...  It's lying.  ...are just starting to ask, how old are these guys?  Like, what?  What?  What is that?  The bionic woman.  Who thinks of her?  So maybe we should have cut the bit?  Yes!  Anthony was watching TV before they ended it with going, in color.  Yeah.  The following broadcast is Living Color on NBC.  Ding, doo, doo.  You might be a child of the 80s if you remember when cigarette companies sponsored comedy hours.  Oh, just posted on their Facebook page, Ant's Got New Sound Effects. 
[02:35:30]  Tune in soon to check out the wacky noises.  This sucks.  This hurts.  This is bad.  Or the $6 million man.  Got a fax here from some guys.  Got a couple.  90% of your album collection was from K-Tel.  You had the Kevin Bacon's haircut.  And Dad bought Beta instead of VHS.  Yikes.  Very good.  Ouch.  Ouch and yikes.  You might be a child of the 80s if you remember trying to guess the episode of the Brady Bunch from the first scene. 
[02:36:00]  I used to play that game.  Did you really?  I never played that game.  Ew.  Can I make an announcement?  Yes.  I don't think there was any fax.  Because this is the topic that segs into Ant's sound effects.  And I believe if you listen to the way you said it.  Oh, and we also got one more fax in.  I believe you're lying and that there is no fax that brings up the Brady Bunch because why would anybody associate the 80s with the Brady Bunch? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, for the record, the 80s were, I mean, the Brady Bunch was late 60s.  I believe it came on right after the monkeys went off the air.  Dude, you guys, it's almost like a serial killer that wants to get caught.  You're just leaving all these fucking clues.  The pressure of this fucking lie is just crashing down on you.  I never even thought this deeply into it, but you're making complete sense.  Yes. 
[02:37:00]  There was no fax about the Brady Bunch.  I officially don't know.  I know I didn't play that dumb Brady Bunch game.  Listen to the clip and you tell me honestly.  If you thought a Chevy Vega was a sports car.  We were serial killers hoping to get caught.  That's perfect.  There was no fax, yes.  Jesus, that's a long list of lies.  So many.  Brady Bunch from the first scene. 
[02:37:30]  I used to play that game.  I used to think I was the only one that did that.  Me and my sister would hang out and Brady Bunch would come on.  I mean, right from the shot of the house.  I go, oh, this one where Gray, Peter, Bobby.  I knew exactly which one it was.  How far did he go with that lie?  I like how he's stammering.  Me and my sister.  I'll go with my sister.  Yeah, we used to do that.  And then the house would come up.  I am woozy.  I'm woozy. 
[02:38:00]  Listening to this.  Literally, I'm woozy.  Here's what happened.  Anthony had Brady Bunch sound effects to do because they're coming.  He had Brady Bunch sound effects to do.  So he told Opie about it.  And Opie thought this was so good.  We have to fit it in now.  So let's just tie it into this 80s bit.  Even though there is no facts about it because it has nothing to do with being a child of the 80s.  Nothing.  Was do-do-do-do one of the sound effects?  No, but it's close. 
[02:38:30]  I said it's the song.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Guaranteed it'll be, you know, the fucking...  It's going to be the keyboard.  And it's going to be the whistle.  Oh, Anthony, it just keeps getting better.  Do you think the sound effects are going to be using the slide whistle?  Yes.  I bet.  And there's going to be two whistles.  You know, there's two whistles.  You remember it.  It's starting to come back to you.  Two whistles.  I can't. 
[02:39:00]  Nothing to do with the 80s.  Yes.  Nothing.  I still got it.  They were rerunning the Brady Bunch in the 80s.  They did it in the 90s and the 70s.  It doesn't matter.  I know, but the child of the 80s is like, it should have been something from the Rubik's  Cube.  How did that never come up?  You know why?  You were too old to play with them.  There's never been anybody who associated the 1980s with the Brady Bunch, ever.  I knew exactly which one it was.  Remember that one with the UFO? 
[02:39:30]  The UFO?  Of course.  Yeah, they were faking that there was a UFO to fool Bobby and the Air Force got involved.  And I think Greg had the flashlight and the little whistle.  Why?  Wait a minute.  It's a UFO.  Wait, I thought that was the sound effect when they were making believe it was a ghost.  Oh, no, no.  That was this.  Totally different.  What's the matter with you? 
[02:40:00]  That was the ghost when they wanted the house to be haunted so they didn't sell it.  Okay, that's the ghost.  All right, now what's the sound effect for the UFO?  Totally different.  What's the matter with you?  You crazy or something?  Yeah.  You crazy or something?  Yeah, I am, I think.  If you want me to be crazy, I'm sweating.  This is a domestic world we're in.  I'm sweating.  Anthony's fake laugh is raspy. 
[02:40:30]  That's how you can tell.  He does a raspy fake laugh.  Oh, yeah.  Opie, after hearing that, do you think there was a fax that came in about the Brady Bunch?  No, I was a radio segue into something I thought might work.  So you're admitting it was a lie.  Maybe it did work for the time.  I don't even know.  It didn't work.  I would say that.  No, it didn't.  No, it didn't.  For any time, it didn't work.  And all the people listening to WAAF were like young rock kids and never watched the Brady Bunch.  No, of course not.  Then how the fuck did we have ratings? 
[02:41:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  At least you guys had a bit there.  Like, at least you drove up to the bit, you went in.  And we went with it.  And you did it.  A lot of supportive laugh.  But I didn't like in that bit, by the way, when you said, isn't that the ghost?  And you immediately had that other whistle.  There wasn't a fucking time for a breath.  And you had that whistle.  Yes, Jimmy.  The ghost whistle.  I think I may have known in advance that I was going to do that.  Had you guys discussed, okay, here's how we'll come out of the 80s bit and be able to get to your Brady Bunch sound effects? 
[02:41:30]  That's a lie, by the way.  I think the conversation was a little more panicked than that.  How are you going to fit the Brady Bunch sound?  Yeah, do that.  Do that.  That'll take up 90 seconds.  90 seconds.  I don't think that wasn't that bad.  We weren't allowed to talk more than five minutes an hour.  So that was our best stuff.  And this CD was pressed to be sent out as, like, this is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, here's a little example.  Yeah.  Of what we did bring to your market.  Just a little piece.  That was a demo?  Yeah.  No, it was a show.  New York, I don't know if you've heard what's going on in Boston, but I got something to play for you.  It wasn't officially a demo.  It was something you sent out, though.  Something we thought was good, though.  What didn't make that tape?  No, I never sent that out.  What didn't?  It was prepared to be sent out.  No.  It was never going to be sent out.  Maybe parts of it, maybe.  I don't know.  Why am I even trying to defend this?  Yeah, it's just...  What are the lies?  Because that was it.  So far, I've got... 
[02:42:30]  No, there is no so far.  We're done.  If the other guys can think of other lies that I missed.  It's done.  That was the last track, Sam.  Thank God.  Lies.  We're from Boston and have accents.  We grew up in the 80s.  We think our listeners are funny.  We like doing this type of radio.  Our calls aren't recorded during the songs.  Opie didn't stop smoking pot seven years ago.  We don't know when the mics are on.  Opie got the list from a listener email.  Opie called 867-5309. 
[02:43:00]  We're single.  There are any problems whatsoever with the phones.  There was a fax about the Brady Bunch, and Opie played the Brady game.  It's not the Brady game.  The Brady game.  Yes, it was.  I just knew that he did some, you know, fun Brady Bunch sounds.  Oh, yeah.  Hilarious.  That's it.  Jacktober is officially over.  How did you come up with those sound effect bits?  Well, Bill, if you've got some time, huh?  Yeah, just interest me.  Take us through your process. 
[02:43:30]  Well, I take things that people just normally look at as everyday items, and I'm able to  turn them around into comedic genius.  I want the real shit when you were sitting at home in your apartment.  Yeah.  Did you run it by him over the phone?  Do you think this is funny?  No, I think I was just fiddling with the fucking toodley horn, the toodley whistle.  Nervous energy during the break.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, this sounded like, you know, that ghost thing.  And Opie's eyes lit up and was like, we're doing that.  We're coming out of break. 
[02:44:00]  We're doing that.  It's gold.  It's gold.  That's right.  We're doing it.  It's fucking painful.  We got one more thing to play for, to end October.  Yeah.  A look back at this year's October.  Thank God.  That's what cleansed the palate.  Bill, Jimmy Fallon tonight?  Yes, sir.  That's fucking cool.  And the podcast, which is doing very well.  Yep.  Back up on iTunes.  Every once in a while, every like three months something happens, I upload something and  it's the wrong format and then they have feel the need to take the entire four years of 
[02:44:30]  podcast off.  Why?  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I have no idea why, but then I have to have a bunch of, and then what I do is I try to  let other people handle it and it doesn't work because evidently the email has to come  from me is what I've learned.  So basically if I would have gotten off my ass and just handled it from the first day,  it just would have been a three year, three week blip instead of three weeks.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah.  Back up there.  Good. 
[02:45:00]  That was pretty boring.  People love fucking Burr's podcast.  Tony Iommi is going to be here.  Yes.  Oh, he's here.  Yes.  Just got here.  Okay.  So why don't we do this?  Bill Burr on Jimmy Fallon tonight.  Bill Burr on Twitter.  Podcast, of course.  We look back at this year's Jacktober with this.  $5,000.  We were going to give it away, but it disappeared.  Kind of a funny story.  You know, if you, uh, you should never say.  Kind of a funny story. 
[02:45:30]  It must have been cold there in my shadow.  Oh, that gave me goosebumps.  Isn't that awesome?  That is fantastic.  Never have sunlight on your face.  Get out of here.  Be honest.  You were content to let me shine.  This is now on their Facebook page.  Oh, my God.  Some guy is jerking off with a handful of shit.  You always won't step behind. 
[02:46:00]  And he's just come.  Are they giving up blocking and removing?  How did this get through the filter?  And then it says, gotta have my bowl.  Gotta get my cereal.  Well, if it isn't a dimly duo.  A beautiful face without a name.  That's not very nice.  For so long.  A beautiful smile to hide the touch. 
[02:46:30]  What I'd like at this immediate moment is to be able to get a word in edgewise.  Did you ever know that you're my hero?  O-M-T.  Hold on.  O-M-T.  This isn't funny.  You're right.  I can fly higher than an eagle.  No.  You are the wind beneath my wings. 
[02:47:00]  I am befuddled.  I am bewildered.  And all the other B words.  It might have appeared to go unknown.  Are you ready for this?  I started my radio career with that guy, Jim.  I've got it all here in my heart.  Yeah, you're all anybody's talking about around here.  Sure, that's a lot of money, right?  I want you to know I know the truth.  Of course, I know you. 
[02:47:30]  I have a fourth reason why people don't go to jail.  Oh, what fourth reason?  They have a good lawyer.  Did you ever know that you're my hero?  It's unreal.  I've seen pictures of him knocking down the road.  It's a good one.  I wish I could be.  It's a good one.  I don't know what this has to do with anything.  I could fly higher than an eagle. 
[02:48:00]  Okay, has this ever happened to you?  You're all scratched up.  You've got pine needles coming out of your skin.  You're sweating.  You get home and go like it.  It's a little crooked, isn't it?  Did I ever tell you you're my hero?  Well, that's a beauty with this one.  You know, with the fake one, you know, it's straight.  Yeah, always straight.  I wish I could be.  Their face is getting pounded.  Well, that's not how it is.  I know.  I didn't want them to.  You know, not just, not are we only broadcasters here, but sometimes we're counselors, therapists. 
[02:48:30]  As I tell Jimmy all the time, I'm not a counselor, but I stayed at a Super 8 motel last night.  Oh, Super 8.  Big spender.  Coming up, 10 occupations that drink the most.  Let me just write down five occupations that I think are heavy drinkers.  You let me fly so hard. 
[02:49:00]  According to a recent survey, what occupation drinks the most?  I've got the top 10 occupations that drink the most, according to a recent survey.  Okay, I got the top 10 occupations that drink the most.  Excuse me.  What is the number one occupation?  Thank you.  Thank God for you.  The wind beneath my feet.  Some noise in here. 
[02:49:30]  Come on, guys.  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got Bill Burr in the studio, and also Tony Iommi is making his way into the studio.  Legend.  Fuck yeah, legend.  Here he comes right now.  Tony.  This is Tony. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, how are you?  What's up, Tony?  How are you doing, man?  Hello.  Oh, I didn't know you were here today.  How are you?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Sure, Jimmy.  Welcome to the show, man.  Bill Burr to your right, Tony.  How are you?  Very funny, man.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to see you.  I can't believe I'm sitting next to you.  That's rock royalty.  Huh?  No.  No, no.  I won't make it weird.  I won't make it weird.  Don't worry about it.  Is this your first interview of the day?  Yes, it is.  I hope so.  It's early.  First one.  First one.  You're known for hating getting up in the morning.  Me?  No, I get up in the morning.  I love it in the morning. 
[02:50:30]  I get up.  Do you really?  Yeah.  We tried to get you in one time.  They're like, no, he doesn't like getting up in the morning.  Good excuse.  When I'm at home, I'm about 20 past six in the morning.  That's not early for you lot, but it's early.  No, it is.  It's early.  Is it?  We have to be here.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I obviously read the book.  I loved it.  You start the book talking about, like, on the first page, you're working in a factory.  You're going to quit.  And your mother says, no, go back.  Finish out the day. 
[02:51:00]  It's the right thing to do.  And can you describe the rest of the day?  Because you were about to walk out.  The rest of the day was awful.  Yes.  I went back after lunchtime, and they put me on this machine that was a press, really,  that bent metal, because I used to do welding, electric welding.  And so I had to bend the metal myself and then weld it, basically.  And just this one, I was on it a couple of hours. 
[02:51:30]  It was fine.  And then suddenly, bang, the thing came down on my hand as I was pushing the metal in.  Whoa.  And it just squashed the ends of the fingers, basically.  And as I pulled my hand back, I pulled them off.  Woof.  How much finger did you lose on the, because you're a lefty, so on the right hand.  Yeah.  Well, I lost, you know, a fair bit off that, off the two middle joints.  And they planted the nail again, put that back in.  So now you, this happens, you're already playing guitar.  I was playing guitar, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  I was playing.  I was about to leave that day to turn professional and go to Germany with a band.  Oh, my God.  What went through your head?  You just went, it's all over.  Oh, that was it.  I mean, that's why I was finishing the work.  And I thought, well, yeah, next week I'm off to Germany.  And it all went very wrong, you know.  How long did it take for you to that, to heal and even to begin?  Did you immediately lose hope or were you looking down going, maybe?  No, I sort of got, that's it, you know, it finished.  And, of course, I saw different doctors and they said, oh, forget it. 
[02:52:30]  You know, you'll never play again.  That was their attitude, not we'll do something for you.  Did you consider playing right-handed?  Maybe you could strum or anything?  It did, funny enough, because it seemed like then I'd been playing a long time left-handed,  which wasn't that long now.  Right, right, right.  But at the time, it seemed like, you know, three years seemed a long time.  Wow.  How long was it before you picked up a guitar again?  But I tried, even though I was bandaged. 
[02:53:00]  So it's not that long.  Oh, wow, right away.  So I was trying to play.  And I did learn to play more with my two outside fingers.  Wow.  That's a hell of a story.  A hell of a way to start a book.  Yeah.  No, just the fact he was going to quit that day.  I know, right?  No, stick it out.  Yeah, stick it out.  It's good, great.  Yeah, I just couldn't believe it.  I just couldn't believe it, after all the things that my mom...  Of course, my mom obviously felt really bad then, because she sort of made me go back  to work.  Well, I love your mom, because without that terrible mood, there'd be no Sabbath.  That's the greatest thing, because you would have been off with that other band. 
[02:53:30]  So it's kind of great for me that that happened.  Well, it sort of made me...  It made me create a different sort of style of playing.  What was that other band?  Did they ever become anyone?  No, I don't think so.  Any of the players, even, move on to other bands?  I don't know.  Wow.  I don't know.  I never actually stayed into...  I just got the job with them, and I didn't really know them that well.  How did it change what you did on the guitar, which kind of gave you the sound that made Sabbath  what they were?  I just had to work on it, and work on getting the height of the strings right for me, the 
[02:54:00]  gauge of the strings, of course, because they were all heavy gauge strings in them days.  And I come up with an idea of light gauge strings.  And I made my own set out of banjo strings, and I went to companies to see if they'd make  them.  They said, well, they won't work.  You'll never be able to work.  Use them.  And I said, well, they do.  I'll use them.  No, they'll never sell.  So that was all these downers as you're going on, you know, you're never going to do any 
[02:54:30]  good.  That will never work recently.  And I just kept going.  A lot of supportive people.  Yeah, exactly.  No, but I love, like, his generation where it's like, well, then to hell with that.  I'll just make my own.  Like, nobody from my generation would just be like, forget it.  I'll get a job in a cubicle.  And that would just be the end of it.  You made everything.  I mean, I made my own gauge strings.  I made my own thimbles to play.  Because it was all said that it couldn't be done.  Can you describe the thimbles?  How do you make guitar strings?  Well, I didn't make the guitar strings. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, that's what you're saying.  I made the setup.  Oh, the setup.  I used banjo strings as the first strings.  And then I used different gauges to drop down so they were lighter for me.  But there was no actual, you couldn't actually go and buy a set of strings like that in those days.  And you had to, can you describe what you had to do with the thimbles so you could actually play?  I got a fairy liquid bottle and melted it down into a ball.  And I got a sold-in iron and just sort of heated it up and melted the inside of the ball. 
[02:55:30]  And then I, so it fit over the finger.  And we took a long time, you know, before it would fit.  And it was a saw.  And I just sat there for days just rubbing, rubbing it down to make a shape of a finger.  And then, of course, it wouldn't, I couldn't play with it because it'd slip off the strings.  So I had to find a material that would grip the strings so I could bend them and stuff.  And at the end of the day, it became, it was leather.  And it was from my old 70s leather jacket that I had. 
[02:56:00]  And I cut it to bits to use the leather.  And I couldn't find anything else that would work.  So you made, basically, you cut, you had your fingers cut off.  You made your own fingers.  Holy shit.  Yeah, and I still use, it's still the same thing today.  I know they make them for me now, but it's still the same.  It's still a very Heath Robinson job, you know.  You're still using the same jacket you said, too, in the book?  Or you had it for many years?  The same jackets to use for the thimbles, yeah.  I've got a small piece left now. 
[02:56:30]  Cut it to bits over there.  I mean, well, over the years, yeah.  It's 40 years.  It's lasted a long time, hasn't it?  Damn.  So did that change the way you actually, because the sound you came, what was the sound you  made?  Because, like, metal didn't exist.  And it's just like that gong or whatever.  That's a terrible impression of a Sabbath sound.  I liked it.  I liked it.  That was good.  It sort of made me approach the guitar a lot differently, because I had to come up with 
[02:57:00]  chords and come up with a way that would suit me to create a bigger sound, because I couldn't  play the regular chords, because it just wasn't possible.  Now, you guys, I was surprised to read, too.  I mean, I've met all of you, and you're all the nicest guys.  I was amazed at how violent you guys were kind of coming up.  There was quite a bit of fighting, and some really violent shit happened.  Yeah, it did, yeah.  But where we were from in them days, that area was fairly rough, and the school we went 
[02:57:30]  to, Ozzy and myself went to the same school.  I don't know what that means, but we did.  And it was very rough, you know.  So you took martial arts.  I was surprised to learn that.  Do you still practice them?  No.  Not anymore.  I'm too old for that now.  But no, I did it for a while, and I enjoyed it at school, you know, when I left school.  But when I took up guitar, it sort of dwindled off then. 
[02:58:00]  Of the guys in the band, who was probably the biggest problem in a bar fight?  Problem?  Yeah, who was the one in Sabbath that would fucking knock your teeth out first?  Well, it was usually me.  Oh, right.  Because I'd, you know, they'd either call for me, oh, we've got a problem here, and I'd  be in, you know.  But in them days, you didn't have security people and all that sort of stuff, you know.  You sort of fended for yourself.  Well, you couldn't afford it.  You fend for yourself, weren't you?  Well, you guys were broke, too. 
[02:58:30]  Like, I mean, it's like you hear about people paying their dues and, you know, and fighting  their way through poverty.  And it's like, did Bill Ward, like, can you describe the drumsticks he used to fucking  play with?  Yeah, he used to.  It's funny, because we'd be playing on the show with another band, and then Bill would  be floating around afterwards, picking up the broken sticks, you know, of the other  drummer, because he used to use, and he got used to playing these half sticks.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:59:00]  Come on.  We didn't have the money to buy, you know, drumsticks or anything, really.  So Bill sort of, again, got a style of playing with these little half sticks.  This level of drive is unbelievable.  And he would just stab them into his hands and duct tape them, and he would just play,  and that's just what you did back then.  Like, the level of toughness from that generation is amazing.  How many times would you have quit at this point?  Oh, just so many.  I would have felt sorry for myself at the factory.  The finger thing?  I would have been out.  I would have been a secretary, made them give me a job as a secretary for life. 
[02:59:30]  That's cool to hear, though.  Well, certainly with his kit and stuff, I mean, it was, we worked hard to get everything.  So he wouldn't let anybody play it.  And there was always a case that John Bonham used to come with us, because he was a friend  of mine, and he used to come with us to some of the gigs, and he'd say, can I have a go,  Bill?  And Bill would go, no.  Because Bill let him get up and play one day, and Bonham, of course, broke his snare.  So it didn't go down very well at all. 
[03:00:00]  How fucking funny is that?  Bonham can't touch my shit because he breaks it every time he plays.  I heard that was like a thing with him, when he would sit in and he would try to demolish  the kit, like when it was over.  Yeah, well, he wouldn't do it.  It was just that he was a heavy drummer and like a real mean drummer, Bonham.  And so it didn't last in bands very long up until Zeppelin.  Did you know he was going to make it the first time you saw him play?  Not really, no. 
[03:00:30]  But it was just such a, the bands he would be in, he'd be in a band for probably two  weeks, and then he'd get fired because he was too loud.  That's great.  Yeah.  Up until Zeppelin, that's the time he really kept the job a long time.  Right, and that was another thing where you'd think he'd be like, well, I keep getting  fired, maybe I should lighten it up a little bit.  And he's just like, nah, to hell with this.  This is what I do until I find people who get it.  The great thing was he used to have the drum case and he'd have the name of the latest  band on his drum case.  And it was getting smaller and smaller because he was, he couldn't fit them all. 
[03:01:00]  And they crossed out the next, the last one he wanted.  And you remained friends with him up until he passed away.  He was the best man at your wedding?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a good man.  We used to go out in clubs and, you know, most of the time I'd end up driving because  he would get paralytic.  Like, I know, I'd be on the way, but, you know.  On the way.  Yeah.  Did he encourage you to drink the night before your wedding or did he think that sobriety  was probably the best? 
[03:01:30]  Oh, dear.  Did he encourage me?  Well, as I said in the book, we went out, just the two of us and a driver, thank goodness.  And we went to different clubs and we went to this last club about, I don't know, 10 to  2 in the morning.  And it was closed at 2.  And Bonham goes in and he goes to the barman, 12 bottles of champagne, all open.  He went, yes, sir.  So he had 12 glasses there and 12 bottles all filled up. 
[03:02:00]  And he went, go on.  I went, what?  He said, go on.  Drink them.  I went, I'm not going to drink them.  He says, you've got to drink them.  I'm open now.  I said, I can't.  I said, if I drink all them, I'm going to get married tomorrow.  What's going to happen?  And he went, ugh.  And he went down and just drank the lot.  And within half an hour, he was just paralytic.  And of course, we had to take him home then.  And his wife wouldn't let him in when we got home. 
[03:02:30]  She said, he's not coming in like that.  Please.  She's shouting out the window.  He's not coming in.  Please let him in.  You know, I'm getting married in the morning.  He's got to be there.  Well, he's not coming in.  And eventually, please let him in.  So she came down.  He can come in, but he's not coming to bed.  He's going to sleep down there.  So we put him up against the radiator in the hallway like this.  Drop him up.  Yeah.  And I said, you're not going to make it tomorrow, are you?  He went, ugh. 
[03:03:00]  Put his thumb up, you know.  I went, oh, OK.  And sure enough, the next morning, he was bright and breezy.  And he lives probably 30 miles from me.  And I saw him coming up the drive.  And I'd just got up.  Me.  And he's all dressed up and coming up the drive.  So he just sort of got that recovery rate.  He could be fine.  He's one of those guys that could fucking function the next day.  I envy that.  I didn't feel too good, but he was fine.  How many times have you been married?  Oh, God. 
[03:03:30]  Three times.  Four times.  This is the fourth.  This is your fourth?  Wow.  I've given up now.  Yeah, this is the last one.  I've decided this is it.  Damn.  Four times.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Like, after one time or two times, you figure that would be the end of it.  But you said, fuck it.  And you went for a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was it like that the moment in that third one where you're like, oh, no, not this again.  This is just going down.  I thought I had this figured out.  Yeah.  I got a complex thing.  It must be me. 
[03:04:00]  I don't really.  After three times, you got to be like, all right, maybe I need to.  Maybe I got to adjust some things.  Yeah.  What was their biggest complaint about you?  From who?  From like the wife.  What was the women's biggest complaint?  Well, certainly the problem from my first marriage, and that was great, really, that  marriage, but I was never there.  I was always on tour or in the studio.  And what sort of got up her back was when she saw it when I was in the studio mixing  the album and everybody had gone away on holiday.  And she'd come, well, everybody else has gone on a holiday with the wives and you're 
[03:04:30]  in the studio.  I know.  I mean, that was, I couldn't look at her.  Someone had to do it.  Isn't it amazing how fucking women, they just, it's like, even the fucking Sabbath, and they  complain.  There's no making them fucking happy, honestly.  They want to live in the great big houses, but what you got to do to get the great big  houses, they fucking complain about it.  You'd have made a great wife.  I never would have complained if I was married to you, ever.  I just would have listened to your music.  Oh, I don't know, I'll marry you.  Please. 
[03:05:00]  I wouldn't want anything in the divorce, just a few signed records.  I'm fucking perfect.  Yeah, you must be thinking that at some point, was there a complaint and just be like,  does she realize that it takes a little bit of work to keep 80,000 people happy a night,  you know?  Yeah, I suppose.  But the thing is, when she sees everybody else going away on holiday, it looks like,  oh, well, he didn't want to take me away.  I suppose that's what it was, you know.  It's that competitive thing.  They all do it.  They all make it about themselves.  It's just what women do.  They do.  They have to be a victim.  They can't go over there. 
[03:05:30]  I'm happy to be here.  They got to somehow turn around.  I love how Jimmy's making me feel like I'm liberal when it comes to this.  This is great.  Go, Jimmy.  Go.  But Tony understands.  It's the way it is.  It's like, you know, this great life you provide for somebody and they get pissed off  at the way you have to provide it.  Yeah.  Do you have to remix every night?  Yeah.  By the way, speaking of remixing, the biggest hit I think Sabbath commercially had would  be Paranoid, I guess.  At least the one that got the most airplay.  Yeah.  And how was that? 
[03:06:00]  That must have been a couple of months to put that song together.  Paranoid?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A couple of days.  What, the whole album?  No, just the song.  No, a couple of minutes.  That actual track took, you know, probably three and a half minutes, four minutes, as  long as it is, really.  We didn't really, I just put the idea down.  Everybody came back from lunch.  I was in the studio and they, I said, I've got this riff because we needed a filler for  the album.  They said, we need one more song.  That was the filler? 
[03:06:30]  Filler.  Yeah.  That's great.  We need one more song and it needs to be probably three minutes.  I went, we'd never done a three minute song.  You know, we were always like seven minutes and eight minutes.  I said, oh God.  So I just put this idea, played this riff and when everybody got back from the pub or  wherever they'd been, I said, well, I've got this idea and let's try and put it down  and that's what we did.  Did they react to it?  Like that's awesome?  Oh, they liked it.  Yeah.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  I thought, ah, it's kind of catchy.  Well, also, they probably liked it because we didn't have anything else and then we had 
[03:07:00]  to have one more song.  It's ironic, really.  That was the quickest thing to do and that's the one that sort of probably got more airplays  than anything.  I heard that song on the subway platform yesterday on the flute.  Paranoid on the flute?  Swear to God.  It's just weird that Tony's here today.  An old lady.  You didn't notice, man.  An old lady just playing Paranoid on the flute.  Do you know what the great part would be if he went down and got her and sued her?  You know?  She was making money off your song yesterday, Tony.  Oh, that's it.  If you want to report her. 
[03:07:30]  She did a very good job and then she went into Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star after that.  And I have to ask, too, because it's – everyone, there's all this – I was just going  to ask if we could hang out later.  The answer's the same.  No.  Everybody wants to know.  There's all this news leaked about Sabbath has been talking.  They haven't been talking.  Can you just tell us or tell me, even if it's whispering, where is Sabbath status right 
[03:08:00]  now?  Whisper it.  All right.  Well, you know, we're all on talking terms and we all – I see myself have been talking  for a long time anyway.  And, of course, geese.  But it's coming on.  We'll see what happens.  You know, you can never say never.  It's going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  Because all the times that people think, oh, it's going to happen.  It's going to happen.  And it doesn't. 
[03:08:30]  Then it's a letdown.  So I really don't know.  It's – let's hope.  But you're open for the idea of possibly doing some new material with the guys.  I'm open for – it would be nice to do something with the old lineup.  What happened to the six songs?  You guys did six songs like – what was it?  I want to say 98 or 97 or 99.  Maybe I could just name every fucking year.  I'll hit the nail on the head if I name 20.  I sold them.  Just piece of stuff.  I love how Joey does that.  But I just caught myself. 
[03:09:00]  I'm like, wasn't it 94, 95, 97?  Stop me when I hit it.  What a terrible interviewer.  Yeah, well, we just did.  I'm a true asshole.  Oh, my God, man.  We did do those songs.  And they sort of just – like a lot of things get put in the box.  And you go back to them another 20 years' time.  But you still have them.  So if you wanted to do new material, you wouldn't have to –  Still have them.  But I don't think we'd use them.  Oh, you wouldn't use them?  I wouldn't think.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Do Ozzy really have no shoes? 
[03:09:30]  Because he said that in interviews, I had no shoes on my feet.  And you described – you said that he would just walk around barefoot.  He did walk around barefoot.  He didn't have a – none of us had a lot of anything.  And the one particular time we were going on tour – when we were going on a tour of Europe.  And we went around to pick Ozzy up in the van because I used to drive.  And he came out with one of those wire coat hangers with a T-shirt on and a pair of jeans.  And I said, is that it? 
[03:10:00]  He says, yeah.  I said, well, we're going away for six or seven weeks.  He went, I know.  I went, oh.  I know.  And that was him.  And yeah, he wouldn't –  I thought, after a night, yeah, he wouldn't have shoes or –  That's just the greatest.  And I'm going to plug the book, too.  Tony's been promoting the book.  Of course.  I mean, obviously, I'm a Sabbath fanatic.  But even if you're not a Sabbath fan, I know, I try to keep that under my hat.  You really do.  You do well.  Yeah.  I try to be fair.  It's called, obviously, Tony Iommi, Iron Man, My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath. 
[03:10:30]  And it's a real biography.  It's like a 370-page biography.  I thought I knew everything about Sabbath, but there's a tremendous amount of things that I learned.  And to me, the most shocking stuff was all the fucking fighting.  I'm going to give a couple of plugs for the signings.  Through the bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey, tomorrow night, which I think is when the book comes out, from 6 to 8 p.m.  That's the independent store in Ridgewood.  Book review in Huntington, Long Island, which is 7 o'clock on Wednesday. 
[03:11:00]  And you can stop off at FH Riley's and have a snack.  St. Vitus Bar.  It's my restaurant out there.  Yeah, it's his restaurant.  We'll take care of it, if you want to know.  St. Vitus Bar in Greenpoint, from 3 to 4 p.m. on Thursday.  And the Barnes & Noble in Tribeca here in the city, 6 o'clock on Thursday.  So Tony is doing 2 on the Thursday.  You know, I love going through the pictures.  I need to know just a little bit about the rocking Chevrolettes from 1964.  I do want to know. 
[03:11:30]  Well, obviously, extremely different than what you did with Sabbath.  Well, it was rock and roll and sort of thing.  Was it like rockabilly?  What kind of?  No, no.  More sort of Chuck Berry type stuff.  Chuck Berry, okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's so weird.  Blues-based kind of.  Hey, the question I wanted to ask was, after you had your accident at the factory, okay,  so now you're saying you can't make, you know, the chords the way you could.  Did that change who your influences were as a guitar player, or did you just? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, it's, that's where I first got to hear of Django Reinhardt, because he had, you know,  he had problems, of course, with his two fingers.  And so that sort of really inspired me to hear his stuff and hear him play and how good  he was.  That still blows me away.  Yeah.  It's incredible, the amount of people that would have stopped.  You know, there's another thing you could have brought up to one of your ex-wives.  You know, you think if this didn't stop me, your bitching is going to stop me?  Shut up, enjoy the ride. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  How many tickets could you sell at a ground round?  Are you serious right now?  It is, it is amazing.  Go tell that to all your shoes.  To have, to have to make your own, especially, like.  Make your own finger?  Make your, especially.  That just amazes me.  What's this called?  The hand that you do this with.  And I'm making the fret hand.  The fret hand?  The other hand, it would have been a little bit easier, right?  Or at least less inconvenient.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  If it had been the other hand, it would have been, well, I wouldn't say no problem, but 
[03:13:00]  it would have, wouldn't have stopped me from, I'd have been able to play the usual way.  Yeah, the other hand's a little more of the business end.  Just the fact that you can't, you can't feel the string now.  That's crazy.  There's something else in between there and you're still able to come up with that.  It's just, that's unbelievable.  It is, it's weird because you really can't feel any string.  You just have to do it by ear, bending the string and, and hopefully it doesn't go boing  and slip off, you know, because it's, you're relying on the leather to grip it.  You don't even realize that, yeah, so much of it is feel, you know, the feel of the 
[03:13:30]  string under your finger.  That's so odd to be able to do that and not have any sensation.  No.  What's going on under there.  Absolutely not.  You having trouble, like, grabbing someone else's guitar and playing it because of the  string thickness and how it's set up?  No, I've never been.  That's the thing as well, being left-handed, it's always.  Oh, well, yeah, that too.  Yeah.  Okay.  Not everybody has a lefty guitar.  And if I've been into a music shop, there might be one left-handed guitar there or something.  Isn't that the worst?  They, they never have, they'll have like one and it's not even a good level one. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  It'd be like one of those Mexican fenders for like 40 bucks.  We got one here in the back.  Have you ever been to Southpaw Guitars in Houston, Texas?  It's basically the guitar center for left-handed guitar players.  I don't think so.  It's insane.  They got everything.  Les Paul's SGs.  I don't want them in there.  Yeah.  What's that?  I don't want them in there.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  It was then I wanted them.  Now you got them thrown at you, you know.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  You think you have to, why did I just say that like he has to go out? 
[03:14:30]  Left-handed, I'm an idiot.  See, I beat you, Jimmy.  I asked a dumber question.  Tell them where a kid doesn't have guitars flying at him, right?  Well, at least you didn't name 40 guitar stores like I did with the fucking years.  At least you quit at one.  I just wanted to know that I knew something.  Hey, and Sabbath, you quit Sabbath before they really became Sabbath and joined Jethro Tull  very briefly.  Yeah.  And can you talk about the Rocky, the Rolling Stone Circus, which you were in? 
[03:15:00]  Which a lot of, which was this classic thing that the Stone shot.  I love that thing.  Oh, and Tony plays in that.  It was weird.  It was very weird.  It's really strange.  Certainly for me.  Because when I went with Jethro Tull and it was a period then I said to Ian, I wasn't  going to stay.  I was going to go back with the other, with Sabbath really.  And he said, would you just do the, we're doing this film.  Would you just do that with us?  And I said, well, okay.  He said, because we won't be able to find anybody in between them.  So I said, yeah, okay. 
[03:15:30]  And what an experience that was, you know.  Just so people know, it was the Stones, Lennon was part of it, The Who, Jethro Tull, Tony,  obviously, Clapton.  And was it, it wasn't Hendrix.  It was, it was Mitch Mitchell.  Mitch, right.  Okay.  I mean, there was virtually everybody then in the zoo.  And it looked like the whole audience was tripping.  They may have been one day.  And they were in like, I haven't seen in a while, but like Rain Slickers or something.  It was, it was, it's a bizarre thing.  And then Yoko Ono, she blew the whole thing. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, that was really strange.  Yeah.  I mean, she sort of, she just started Lennon's feet.  It was, it was almost like the first super group.  You guys are all jamming.  And then she gets up to the mic and starts doing her dumb cat noises.  You couldn't have liked that, Tony.  Pardon?  He's going to be a gentleman.  He's going to be a gentleman.  Tony references it in the book.  He does?  Yeah.  It's like, what is she doing?  It's not a glowing review.  Okay, good, good, good.  I mean, as a, as a music fan, you're like, this is a, this is never going to happen again. 
[03:16:30]  And then she steps up to the mic.  Did I ever show you guys that YouTube video where it's Lennon and Chuck Berry playing on  TV and, and Yoko's there and they're doing one, I think one of Chuck's old songs.  So Chuck's killing it.  Lennon's psyched that he's there.  And then in the middle of the song, Yoko just goes, walks up to the mic.  No, she had a mic on her bongo.  She turned the mic up to her face and just goes, yeah, I don't know.  You see Chuck Berry makes his eyes just go wide. 
[03:17:00]  Like, because one of those deals, like, it's not my place to tell her to shut the fuck up.  But, but shut the fuck up.  Yes.  Lennon must've been scared of her because you're with all your peers and you allow that to happen.  It was awful.  Well, I mean, besides that, the rock and roll circus is an amazing thing.  It didn't seem that bother, to be honest.  I mean, they seem so much in another world, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, he might've been.  And sometimes you get caught up in something and you think that your chick is better than  she really is or, or higher than she is or whatever, whatever the situation is.  He might've just thought like, it was great what she was doing. 
[03:17:30]  It was rough.  Yeah.  I mean, I've, I've seen, it's not good.  You didn't look at the people's faces.  Well, I've seen all the rest of the musicians and it was, oh my God.  Oh, they were all, but you know, who's going to say anything?  Yeah.  That's the understatement of the, oh my God.  And Jimmy talks about it in the book, right?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  And it's, he's not as kind in the book.  Good, good.  He's very nice.  He's being very nice now, but you can tell by the way it's written. 
[03:18:00]  Were you responsible for any of the Jethro Tull songs or it was so brief?  There was one song that I just done a riff on, which was Nothing Is Easy.  Okay.  When they were writing that, but that was it.  We'd have gone after that.  Did you guys write Fairies Wear Boots?  Was that, there was a fight you had with a bunch of skinheads, a really violent altercation.  Did you write Fairies Wear Boots based on that?  No, I don't think it was that. 
[03:18:30]  Giza wrote all the lyrics, of course, on that.  So, I mean, he had a wild, weird imagination of things depending on what he'd smoked the day before.  Other days.  He could have possibly have done it from that, but I think it was more from a vision he saw when we were in Germany once, somebody leaping across the snow.  And he just, he used to come up with these funny sort of titles and funny, you know, weird sense of humor when he goes. 
[03:19:00]  Is that where the, why did the skinheads attack you?  Because that was a, because you said at one point I handed Ozzy a hammer and they went outside and Ozzy was smashing people.  He, I didn't have it in me, he grabbed a hammer, yeah.  What happened was Giza, we did, there was mobile phones in them days or there wasn't even a phone in the building where we played.  So Giza went out to phone our management at that time to find out if we were collecting cash or what it was after the gig.  And as he was in the phone box outside, a load of skinheads just surrounded the phone box. 
[03:19:30]  And of course, you know, they were going to get him.  And when he came out, they sort of whacked him and he ran and he came in to us.  And he said, oh, you know, told us about all these lot outside.  So rather than stay inside and be safe, Ozzy grabs a hammer, that's awesome.  Well, we had to go out, we had to get out because we would leave the buildings and they're all outside waiting, you know.  So there was no option really. 
[03:20:00]  So we went out and he just grabbed the hammer and thank God he did really because, I mean, there was a lot of them.  There weren't just like half a dozen, there was like probably 40 of them.  Wow, man, yeah.  One man with a hammer, that'll make a lot of people leave.  Well, it made a few people uncomfortable, I know that.  But sort of one, somebody grabbed me, grabbed him around the neck and he went boing with a claw back on their head.  But just Ozzy hitting somebody with the claw end of a hammer, I can't picture it. 
[03:20:30]  I just can't.  I pictured it.  You think that guy brags about it now?  See the scar?  Yeah.  Let me tell you a little story.  I've wondered that.  Like, do those skinheads ever like in three years go,  Oh my God, that was fucking Black Sabbath we had to fight with.  Just got hit by a hammer by Ozzy.  You'd get hit by a hammer by Ozzy, right?  Any of the guys could hit me with anything they wanted to.  Tony's wearing a cross, I hope he fucking sticks at my eye.  I'll take it.  He's not joking, Tony.  He's not joking.  I'm always interested, too, by rock feuds or people that have these weird things that we don't get to see. 
[03:21:00]  And you said that Bonham came, John Bonham came to one of your shows in 1980 with, and this is with the Ronnie James Dio line-up.  And him and Dio had some kind of words?  Um, well, yeah, it wasn't, it was, yeah, that's some kind of word.  Um, we'd, we'd, John came to the gig, uh, when we played at Hammersmith in London, and we were going to go out after the show to a bar. 
[03:21:30]  Um, anyway, John's drinking away on the side of the stage, drinking Guinness, and, um, we came off stage, and as we walked, walked past John, John said to me,  oh, man, he's got a, he's got a great voice for a midget.  And, of course, Ronnie heard it, and he didn't mean it sort of like that.  He meant, he actually meant that he, what a little buddy, and he'd got a big voice, but the way he said it, and, of course, Ronnie popped up my knee. 
[03:22:00]  He, I won't repeat what he said.  And they were going to fight.  I mean, he, I mean, he, I'll, I'll repeat what he said.  Ronnie walked up to him and said, you fucking cunt.  And, uh.  Dio said that to John.  So, basically, I had to get him out there.  I said, look, just, just go, and I'll, I'll see you later.  Just get out.  And you've, uh, you've rented quite a bit.  This was, uh, I, I, there's, like, a weird thing with you and the supernatural, and my, one of my favorite stories in the book. 
[03:22:30]  There's going to be no point.  I'm in this book.  It's old, everything.  Yeah.  But I'm still going to read it, though.  I want to get out of all the details.  Believe me, there's a lot more than I'm giving.  I can't wait to get into this now, especially because of Jimmy.  There's so many interesting things in it.  Like, and, uh, there's a great, uh, chapter where you, uh, or a piece.  And the chapters, by the way, what I love, they're very short.  Like, literally two and three page chapters.  So, like, any subject, you're just hitting boom, boom, boom.  And it moves.  The book moves very, very quickly.  I love when you can knock out a chapter quickly.  Dude, and you read six chapters. 
[03:23:00]  Just knock it out.  Oh, I got one more chapter.  It's two pages.  Fuck, 32 pages left in this chapter.  Damn it.  Then you get to the pictures, and you're like, oh, there's five pages down.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's just the way you do it when you're trying to finish a book.  It's like a job.  Hey, how come if you have all these great stories about, uh, John Bonham?  They're all hilarious.  And, like, in, I'm a John Bonham freak.  Why, whenever they do one of those retrospectives, why don't they have, you would think if the guy  was the best man at your wedding, that they would assume that you kind of knew him,  and that you would be able to add, uh, to the story.  Like, I know the BBC just did one with, uh, Dave Grohl was, uh, was, was narrating it. 
[03:23:30]  How come, did they ever ask you to do those types of things?  No, I don't think so.  No, I've done a couple of things on, on John, you know, of course, when he, uh, just, uh,  little stories.  But no, no, nothing, uh, big TV thing, no.  Yeah, because those are, like, two of the best stories.  Oh, my God.  I've heard.  And then it's hilarious.  Yeah.  And with, like, all the different names.  I got to ask one drummer geek question that dramas are going to want.  How the hell did he, was his bass drum foot that fast? 
[03:24:00]  Did you ever see him?  Did he play with his toe?  Was it heel up?  Did I ever see him?  I mean, did you ever, like, stand, like, rather than, like, you know, when you're out in front  of a drummer, you can't see what their bass drum foot is doing.  Was he heel up, heel down?  I, I don't know, because I used to, I used to sort of see him from, uh.  Mystery.  I used to go to gigs with him when he was with another band before Zeppelin called The Way  of Life.  And, oh, they used to play at some right dumps.  And there's always, again, and again, there was always fights.  Every time, you know, in them days, there was always a fight there for some reason. 
[03:24:30]  And this one place they played at, there was, it broke out into a horrendous fight.  But I always remember Bonham, he had his, he had all these pints of beer all around his  kit.  And he'd be, you know, drinking them and playing.  But he was just really a, just a special drummer.  Really was.  No, just an incredible drummer.  And his sound was unreal.  That's back in the spring.  He came right through the 70s.  He started muting their drums.  And he was still, once again, just focused.  Just doing it my way.  Go fuck yourself up.  Well, he used to try different things.  I remember he tried, uh, he tried getting a drum sound in, in a big truck. 
[03:25:00]  He set up the, his kit in a, in a, inside a big truck for the, the ambience.  Of a truck.  Yeah.  The ambience of a truck.  Yeah.  And, um.  Oh, for like, when, like recording, he tried, he wanted to try to see what it sounded like.  Because it sounded like shit.  I don't think he used it.  I don't think.  And so, you know, I'm not going to give all the stories away.  There's a couple, I will, because we're, we're almost finished on the Open Anthony show.  There's a million stories.  Here's the stories I will not tell.  The time you almost killed Bill Ward. 
[03:25:30]  Uh, the time you set Bill Ward on fire.  And, uh, the night fight that Geezer Butler almost had with Malcolm Young of ACDC in a bar.  The bar fight, uh, where somebody got shot in the mouth.  There's a lot of things I am not going to tell the story.  You just don't, isn't there?  Oh, no, but there's lead-ups and there's happenings and there's so much stuff.  That supernatural thing got my interest.  What were you going to ask?  Well, there was a car accident.  Uh, I was going to talk about the rented house, but I won't talk about that.  That's a.  There's many stories.  There's a very fucking creepy story about renting a house, um, where you were hearing things. 
[03:26:00]  What happened when there was a car accident you had, um, which I thought was pretty interesting.  Were you, uh, did you not go off, uh, an embankment or something?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I was, uh, driving.  It was a convertible and I was driving along.  On the outside lane, just overtaking somebody.  And it was a girl accident.  I'm looking.  And, um, suddenly there, bang, bang.  And the tyres just blew.  I must have gone over something.  And it just pulled the car off.  And I went flying off. 
[03:26:30]  There was a huge drop at the side of the, um, of the road.  Of this, like, a freeway type thing.  And I came off that and went through the trees and saw the panels of the, of the, uh, wings  come off the, the car.  Um, I thought, that's it, you know.  Bang, it's a tree.  And, but, but, what do you want to hear about seeing angels?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really peculiar.  I saw three and, I saw these three figures.  Um, and I wasn't drugged or anything like that.  It was, uh, it was a real, um, strange feeling. 
[03:27:00]  And then, then the car, then the car tipped up upside down and I was knocked out.  But, but yeah, I did see that.  And there's a lot of stories of, of supernatural things.  And the way they're told, I, and I, I'm really skeptical about that stuff.  But the way you describe, whether it's you or Bill or you and Gieser seeing this stuff  in these different places you were recording, I, I find it very believable because the  way people talk to each other, it's, it's the way people see something together.  Um, so it actually, I find that to be a really interesting aspect of the book. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I normally wouldn't.  I mean, some people go, oh, you know, they've had too many drugs or too many drinks or  whatever.  But it wasn't the case.  You know, all the things and the other guys would see the same thing.  So it's, uh, yeah, it's quite interesting.  Well, I guess, I mean, I could, I'm talking to Tony, uh, for another half hour on my Boneyard  show, which will air tomorrow.  But, uh, what can you say about the book?  It's amazing.  And I genuinely loved it.  There's a million great stories in it.  Um, it's called Iron Man, my journey through heaven and hell with Black Sabbath. 
[03:28:00]  And tomorrow comes out and the signings are at bookends in Ridgewood, uh, six to  eight p.m.  Book review in Huntington is on Wednesday at seven, right next to Opie's restaurant.  St.  Vitus, uh, St.  Vitus bar in Greenpoint, uh, three to four p.m.  On Thursday, Barnes and Noble in Tribeca at six o'clock on Thursday.  So, you know, what can I say?  You just, you know, you changed my life.  This was good.  This was good, Obed. 
[03:28:30]  No, it was good.  Believe me, I would have liked trannies anyway.  That had nothing to do with that.  It's all.  Really, really good.  Good interview.  Yeah, we love you, man.  And, uh, and Bill Burr just quickly is going to be on Fallon tonight.  So yeah, kind of pales in comparison with John Bonham, legendary rock star.  No, but it doesn't.  You have something cool to tell Tony right now.  You just, Tony can go, oh, I'll watch you later.  It's like two, two guys who both have great careers going and I took the night off so  I can fucking, I'm doing nothing tonight.  Why?  I don't know.  I was hoping you might have nothing to do and go, Jim, do you want to eat? 
[03:29:00]  I'm like, ah, whatever.  Oh, well, okay, if you ask.  Tony, I owe me a pleasure, obviously.  And I think we're done?  We are done for the day.  We'll be back tomorrow.  All right.  Chop, chop.  Thanks.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Furious XF. </pre>
