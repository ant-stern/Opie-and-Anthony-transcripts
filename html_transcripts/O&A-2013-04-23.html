<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the now-viral video of A.J. Clemente, a news anchor who uttered the phrase "gay fucking shit" on live television. The hosts replayed the clip multiple times, focusing on Clemente's profanity and the ensuing chaos, and discussed his subsequent firing and tweets.  They attempted to contact Clemente for an interview.  The show then shifted to the firing of comedian Paul Mooney from a Boston comedy club for allegedly making offensive remarks about white people. Opie and Anthony debated the context and the justification for his dismissal, referencing similar controversies involving other comedians, and also attempted to book Mooney as a guest.  They also touched on the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, speculating about the death penalty and the rapid dismissal of terrorist links by authorities,  followed by a discussion of a foiled terrorist attack in Canada. Opie proudly announced his successful Netflix stock investment and his plan to buy another dinosaur statue.  A segment featuring Will Sasso's Arnold Schwarzenegger Vine videos and music from The Rolling Stones concluded this section.

The next segment heavily featured a recounting of various pranks played on a man named "E-Rock," including a cinnamon challenge gone wrong, eye injuries from grapefruit juice, waxing mishaps, and forced exposure to unpleasant odors. E-Rock himself participated in the discussion, describing his experiences.  The hosts then discussed various internet challenges like the "cinnamon challenge" and "condom challenge," showcasing video clips. This transitioned into a news story about an overweight woman denied tanning services and a refund, sparking a debate about the salon's actions, the woman's entitlement, and societal views on obesity.  The segment concluded with a discussion of "Con Air," the "Lone Ranger" movie trailer,  Clayton Moore's legal battles over his Lone Ranger mask, anecdotes about Jimmy Norton's past employment at Pergament Home Centers, and the death of Badfinger's Peter Ham, interspersed with Badfinger music.  Various celebrities were mentioned in passing, including Ryan Lochte, the Kardashians, Chris Humphrey, Sean Penn, and Hugh Jackman.

A significant portion of the following segment focused on music identification, with Opie, Anthony, Jimmy Norton, and E-Rock playing songs and guessing artists and release years.  The suicide of Badfinger's Pete Ham, attributed to his manager stealing his money, prompted a discussion about financial management.  A caller, Megan, shared a story about Firefall's Larry Burnett working at a UPS store, leading to further discussion about the fates of various musicians, including The Raspberries' lead singer and members of Cinderella and Boston.  Another caller described an encounter with a financially struggling member of Cinderella.  A lengthy phone call with Paul Mooney followed, where he detailed his firing from a comedy club, claiming it was a setup orchestrated by the police due to his jokes on sensitive topics.  He discussed freedom of speech and the challenges faced by comedians.  The conversation included tangents on Mooney's claims, an upcoming fight featuring Yale Sunning and John Jones, Ryan Lochte's perceived intelligence, and a controversy involving Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Nike removing Boston Marathon bombing-themed shirts. The segment concluded with several listener calls and a lengthy, angry, and threatening call from an unidentified individual.

The next segment featured another phone call with Paul Mooney, where he criticized the media's focus on the Boston Marathon bombing perpetrator rather than the victims and their sensationalization of such events.  Opie and Anthony discussed their own experiences with media attention and controversy.  Anthony mentioned a profitable Netflix stock sale, contrasting it with a discussion about the struggles of Black men. The conversation then shifted to Apple's upcoming earnings report and the firing of Paul Mooney.  The after-show segment, hosted by Sam Roberts with guests Jesse May Peluso and intern Alan Thicc Jr.,  focused heavily on Alan Thicc Jr. finding and eating a jar of expired (1996) peanuts from the office garbage.  The hosts and guests discussed the age, smell (described as ammonia), and potential health risks of the peanuts,  Alan Thicc Jr.'s personality, and other office happenings, interspersed with listener calls.  There was also significant discussion about the handling of a previous phone call on the main show, involving a misdirected call intended for Eric, which impacted Eric's work, the show's flow, and other individuals including Roland, Jesse May, and Jason/John in New Jersey.  Apologies were offered to everyone involved, with particular concern about the impact on Anthony's sobriety.  A planned segment with Jesse May about "girl code" was preempted by this phone call mishap.  A live read for "I Hate Steven Singer.com," promoting gold-dipped roses, and a mention of Jesse May's upcoming MTV show, "Girl Code," concluded the segment.

The final segment detailed the fallout from a phone call mishap involving Sal, who mishandled a call intended for Eric, leading to apologies to Eric, Opie, Anthony, "Nuts," Roland, Jesse May, and Jason/John in New Jersey.  The incident interrupted a music cue and involved extensive discussion of Sal's responsibility and potential effects on Anthony's sobriety.  A planned "girl code" segment with Jesse May was also affected.  The segment concluded with a live read for "I Hate Steven Singer.com" and a mention of Jesse May's MTV show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, and now a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, sir.  Entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beam from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What?  Why didn't we listen?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts.  We already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  He's dang open-handed.  Only he's dang open-handed.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, everyone.  There it is.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  It's fucking cold in New York.  I hate this shit when it's cold in the spring because it just makes the summer seem that much shorter.  We don't really have spring anymore.  It kind of jumps to summer, doesn't it?  I remember last year, winter kind of lingered.  Lingered.  I think by April that we started.  We've seen something.  A little bit.  A little bit.  This is fucked. 
[00:01:30]  It's ridiculous.  What's wrong with the mics today?  Why?  What happened?  Something's...  Whatever.  Something amiss?  We'll deal.  Sounds all right.  Doesn't sound right.  Sounds different today.  On you?  Than it was yesterday.  Yes, it does.  Oh, man.  Maybe this is a little too high.  Now, that means you've got to do your thing over there.  And then let me go over here and adjust over here.  How's that for you?  Well, I'm turning my volume up a lot.  I know.  Well, that's the other issue.  I said the TV was real low today. 
[00:02:00]  We watch TV.  We watch TV before we work.  Watch the TV.  MSNBC, I guess, gave us a quick little plug.  I think Alex in the booth might be a fan of the show.  It was a mention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a plug, I guess.  Just a quick shout out.  Because everyone's talking about good old A.J. Clemente.  Oh, poor A.J. Clemente.  And we're, I think we're going to have him on the show today.  I think we're going to get the big scoop.  That'd be nice.  This is in our wheelhouse, though. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  This really is one for us.  Yeah, it is.  So, MSNBC, The Morning Joe, they were starting their show.  And then this just happened.  So, when's he coming, Alex?  Come on, man.  Hey, Alex, when are we getting him on?  Did you call him?  Yeah, we're working on him.  I think he and Opie and Anthony are working on a thing.  No, no, no, no.  I'm serious.  No, no, no, no.  We are working on him.  He needs to be on a new show.  I want him here.  We're in Florence, so we can get him a job.  So, Mr. F-Bomb can tell him everything he needs to know. 
[00:03:00]  It was a nice mention, but another person that just can't figure out Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know.  Opie, it's probably the rushing to end.  Opie and.  Yeah, yeah.  Opie and.  End.  I don't know, but.  Opie and Anthony.  So, do they really want him on, you think?  Or, I doubt it.  Well, they probably don't.  I mean, he's going to end up on Letterman.  Yeah.  He's going to end up on Letterman.  This, I was telling that just before the show, this could be the funniest clip I've 
[00:03:30]  ever seen on YouTube.  It gets funnier and funnier the more you watch it.  And I'm so loving the part where he talks about himself.  Yeah.  Because he falls apart.  Like, he realized what happened.  He realized he fucked up.  And he can't put a coherent thought together about where he's from, what he did.  Bar, bar.  It's great.  And then the woman that he does the news with, for the one lousy day, he got to do 
[00:04:00]  it.  Not even a half a day, because I think they do two broadcasts.  He got through the first, I would assume.  She's completely flustered.  She's panicked.  She's here and gave fucking shit.  So, she's thinking, oh my God, we're all getting fired.  Yeah.  So, she's off her game completely.  Yeah.  And then the mumbling over the, you know, the voiceover to start the news he doesn't  even do right.  Uh-huh.  Can we play it again?  Yeah.  I'm sure most have heard this clip, but it just gets funnier. 
[00:04:30]  Dreams in Motion organization has a fun time for the disabled.  A deadly avalanche kills five in Colorado.  You're watching the evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high  definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening, I'm Dan Tew.  You may have seen our news from AJ on NBC North Dakota News, and he'll be joining the  Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Boink. 
[00:05:00]  She wants to go with you.  Shut up.  We're live.  Gay fucking shit.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  His appearance was disastrous.  It was a disaster.  Oh.  It's the worst debut in history.  It's an unmitigated disaster.  It's the worst debut in history of mankind.  Do you think every news guy in the country loves this?  This has to be every news guy in the country's favorite clip in history.  Absolutely. 
[00:05:30]  It's right out of Anchorman.  But now I'm really into her, because she's like, oh my god, this poor little thing is  thinking she's going to get fired.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to start it over, or at least somewhere in there.  The dreams in motion organization has a fun time for the disabled.  A deadly avalanche kills five in Colorado.  You're watching the evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high 
[00:06:00]  definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening, I'm Dan Tew.  You may have seen our newest host, AJ, on NBC North Dakota News, and he'll be joining  the Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Can you pause again?  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  Because she really messes up.  What did she say there?  Seeing him anchor.  Like, she's starting to...  Did they try to dump out of him real quick?  Did they?  Oh, is that what that is?  It was an audio dump.  Is that...  Is that...  I think so. 
[00:06:30]  Might have been.  Oh, and he's trying to dump out of him.  In the beginning?  Yeah.  Or maybe they turned his volume down.  Right.  His mic off.  And then popped it back up.  It's great.  But what did she try to say there?  Because she's trying to introduce him, but she's completely off her game.  I think she's trying to say my new co-host, AJ Clemente.  Right.  But she's distracted because he's saying fucking shit into a live motherfucker.  Saying gay fucking shit.  And then mumbling.  Yeah, go back to her.  You don't have to go all the way back.  I see you.  I see you.  And he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor. 
[00:07:00]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  Because he's mumbling.  Thanks, man.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University, and I'm used to, you know, from being from the East Coast.  Okay, well...  What does that mean?  I'm used to it as you're being from the East Coast. 
[00:07:30]  It's very funny the way he goes, I graduated from West Virginia University.  But we don't start coming off when he's just saying that.  He lost it.  It looks like a contestant for, like, Teen Jeopardy or, like, College Jeopardy or something.  Yeah.  Go back and look at his head when he's mumbling.  The look on his face when he looks up is utter and complete panic.  Right.  Because obviously someone tells him that, dude, you're on.  You're on. 
[00:08:00]  You're cursing live on the air.  He looks up so quickly, and he's horrified.  Right.  Tell us.  That almost looks like a jump cut.  Huh?  And then when he goes into who he is, he can't even fucking fathom what just happened.  He's hearing, like, shh.  Yeah.  He's hearing some kind of a white voice.  Hmm.  You see that again, the pop-up.  Oh.  And then just let it roll into what he...  You said that just to focus him, like, tell us about yourself. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe.  Because you couldn't believe he wasn't paying attention.  No, I think it was, you know, yeah, it's his first day, so they want a quick little,  you know, tell us about yourself type of thing.  I think that was planned.  My co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ.  Thanks, man.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University, and I'm used to, you know, from being from the  East Coast.  And then he just looks at her.  He looks at her like, yeah, I fucking nailed that one. 
[00:09:00]  As far as I'm going.  Holy shit.  Oh, this poor guy.  I'm used to being from in East Coast.  East Coast.  And he nods.  Yeah.  And he nods like, right?  Did you get it?  Yeah, you got that.  Right?  Sure, yeah.  Well, the update, he obviously was fired.  I think most people know by now, but in case you don't, he barely survived one newscast,  and they fired him.  It's a bit of a no-brainer.  Right.  But they had meetings and stuff, and thought, you know, we got to move AJ up to the anchor 
[00:09:30]  desk.  There was a whole thing that went on.  Yeah, yeah.  And the guy was fired in pretty much less than a day on the job.  They knew right when he said that he was going to be fired.  Uh-huh.  And people say, I think that video is doctored.  It's, I don't think so at all.  No.  The guy really got fired, Tim, in that, oh, you hung up on us, all right?  Yeah, it's not doctored.  We thought so at first, or I did.  I was thinking, you know, someone's trolling or doing something here.  Has he been tweeting since the firing, Sam? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, he tweeted a couple things.  I know he's written Roland back in his tweets, and I know we're, I don't know if we're officially  having him on, but...  Unfortunately, KFYRTV has decided to let me go.  Thank you to them and everyone in North Dakota for the opportunity and everyone for the support.  Rookie mistake.  I'm a free agent.  I can't help but laugh at myself and stay positive. 
[00:10:30]  Wish I didn't trip over my, quote, freaking shoes out of the gate.  I kind of like this guy.  I mean, he's talking about it.  Oh, my God.  He's talking about it.  He'll wind up being on a web redemption on Tosh.  He writes to Rolando's, just pop me a message in response to DM me.  Would love for you to call into the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  Yeah, so he might make it.  He might make it on today.  We'll see.  What is web redemption?  I've never seen Tosh's show. 
[00:11:00]  It's people that wind up fucking up.  They get a viral video like this.  Exact, perfect example is this one.  Yeah.  And he has them on and kind of, in a funny way, recreates what they did and tries to let  them do it the right way.  Oh, that's good.  That's what a cool idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking smart.  Yeah.  Just like redemption.  All the leeches that jumped on after he responded to Roland.  Yeah.  And people going, hey, would you call into my show?  Would you call into my show?  Bastards.  Like who?  Well, one of them is Mark Zito saying, can you follow me so I can message you about a 
[00:11:30]  different SiriusXM show?  Fucking Zito.  What is he doing?  Asshole.  Get out of our fucking way.  Yeah.  What the fuck is he doing?  Fucking Zito.  Complicating things.  And then another guy.  If Zito was in The Sopranos, he'd have been whacked out like so fucking early on.  Easy.  Just like, season one.  Get rid of that kid.  Get rid of him.  Yeah.  It's a very difficult situation.  What situation? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, this is an eager young man.  Oh, he's an asshole.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Trying to make things happen.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  Right after we're trying to make things happen.  Yeah.  We're not on the tar pit yet.  Get out of the way.  Don't fucking...  Get out of our fucking way, man.  Another guy.  I want to come on our afternoon show in Kansas City.  Somebody saying, you want to do an interview with an Australian radio show?  I know.  I know.  So you said gay fucking shit.  I know.  When you said it, were you thinking, I know? 
[00:12:30]  I know.  Let me say hi to Psycho Bob.  Psycho Bob, what's up, buddy?  Good morning, boys.  Morning, man.  The most horrifying thing is you know how much he was looking forward to this.  He's worked his whole career for this, and in five seconds, it's gone.  It's out of the toilet.  It's tragic.  Dude, this is like going on Letterman of the Tonight Show and blanking.  So this is like, I mean, standing there and just blanking going, I can't do this. 
[00:13:00]  I can't.  That's the equivalent of that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's unsalvatory.  Yeah.  This is going to be in NYC today.  Yeah, he's going to be on Letterman.  I don't know.  This is perfect for Letterman.  I would assume so.  There's no doubt in my mind he's on Letterman tonight.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing the top ten, just dropping F-bombs.  Yeah.  That's pretty funny.  That would be good.  Doing the top ten and cursing everyone.  There's no doubt in my mind. 
[00:13:30]  There's no doubt in my mind.  So I wonder if we're going to get him or if he's going to get a plane.  I know.  I hope we get a little interview with him today.  Well, maybe tomorrow we'll get him in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  I would rather get him on the phone today.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do both.  Get a hold of Roland and see where we're at with him.  That would be good.  Roland's really got to work this one, right?  Unless Mark Zito grabs him for the other show.  Yeah, Zito might throw in more static into the mix.  Throw in more distractions and bullshit in while we're trying to fucking book a guest.  Right. 
[00:14:00]  He could just be like, hey, Roland, once he commits to you guys, can you talk to him?  He has to throw static in.  Static.  That's what it is.  It's static.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Bullshit.  That's fucking bullshit.  What's going on with Paul Mooney, man?  Jesus.  Paul Mooney.  He just had that...  What exactly did he say?  I don't...  I mean, again, I don't know if it's being paraphrased.  Because we're trying to get him on the show today as well. 
[00:14:30]  Let me find it here.  I'm a little...  He's just for a cause.  Look how cute.  Is that cats?  Oh, no.  It's a little puppy.  Yes, it is.  Where's our Paul Mooney story?  I don't know.  It's here.  I think it was in yesterday's packet.  Let me go grab the phone.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Why wouldn't it be in today's packet?  You know, we never heard about...  Why would it be in yesterday's packet if he's going to be on the phone?  Never heard about...  No?  Yeah?  I want to hear that.  Eventually, we will.  He sent us something to the effect... 
[00:15:00]  I don't know what's going on.  I cut you off with a pass on that one.  Yeah.  Eventually, we will, though.  I'm sorry.  Let me be live, like, last weekend or something.  Yeah.  And they're saying he said something about...  He had one more show to go, and they fired him because he said something like, the white  people in Boston got what they deserved.  Oof.  But I don't know if it was that literally or if that was in the middle of...  I would have to hear it.  That's, uh, yeah.  Rough thing to say, obviously. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, but did he say...  Because he got, like, 20 walkouts.  And did he say it in the context of, uh, they got what they deserved and that was the statement?  Or was it part of his setup to something else?  Like, there's a way to say that where it's not...  Yeah, I understand.  You know.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They got what they deserve, being nice to, uh, certain groups of people.  Like, but in a comedic way, like, that's what you get for being nice to, uh, you know.  In this thing and age, it doesn't work in my mind.  Oh, yeah, but again, he's pretty much flown...  He's almost immune to that shit. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, he's untouchable.  He's, you know, been around long enough.  Yeah.  Everyone knows what his act is and his viewpoints.  But they fired him.  And he's black.  So, it's a lot easier for a black guy to get away with fucking murder on a stage than it  is a white guy, Michael Richards.  Although, yeah.  Yeah, but he, in Mooney's defense, he says whatever he wants.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I've seen...  Oh, he says, right?  Yeah.  I've seen audiences object to him before.  He doesn't give a shit.  Yeah.  Well, we gotta get the context of the soundbite that they're just throwing out there. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Is there a soundbite from him?  Oh, not a soundbite, but the quote, I should say, yes.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a soundbite officially out there.  I don't like doing these prep sheets are done.  Oh, shit.  The one piece is too big, the font.  There's two pages to every one.  Oh, shit.  I like a nice short...  Like a nice short...  Look at this.  There's 30 pages of work here.  Yeah.  I guess that's if you want to delve into the story.  Really dive in.  Jump in with both feet. 
[00:17:00]  E-Rack's been in charge of the prep sheets.  Oh, shit.  Fucking who?  Giant font McGillicuddy?  I guess Rich...  I don't know how his fucking movie's coming.  That's what I want to know.  Rich in Yonkers has more of Paul Mooney.  Rich!  What's up, fellas?  Thanks.  Paul Mooney said something closer to the effect of white people are stupid.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  What exactly?  What was he referencing because of how they...  The moon landing, I guess. 
[00:17:30]  You know.  Oh, how white people would...  The automobile.  Things like that.  Oh, fair enough.  Traffic lights, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what was he referencing?  I can't talk if I'm laughing at Anthony.  He was saying how they were running around like a bunch of roaches and white people are stupid.  But in what...  Like, white people are stupid in what context?  What was the joke?  What was the point he was making?  It's hard to recreate it.  I'm sorry if I'm not doing a good job of it.  Oh, you were actually there.  Okay. 
[00:18:00]  Wow, you really are a terrible witness.  Yeah, you weren't doing a good job as a newscaster?  Yeah.  Holy fuck, you were there.  Thanks, Rick.  I am terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  We'll handle it from here.  So he didn't say that white people deserve what they got.  No, he's gone.  They canceled the last of six appearances, including last night or two nights ago, sold out 930 show.  Really?  Yeah.  The only quote is somebody on Twitter accused him of saying, Paul Mooney last night at Levity Live said white people in Boston deserved what they got. 
[00:18:30]  That's a tweet.  Yeah, but what else did he say around that?  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, obviously that's a rough statement, but I wonder what was said around that.  And does it make it a little easier to digest?  I don't know.  I'm surprised they fired him because he's got, it's like, yeah, he got some walkouts, but that's, if he had a sold out show.  The time you, like, Patrice got fired once from, I think, a club in Cleveland. 
[00:19:00]  Sometimes clubs fire guys for doing something egregious or not drawing, like, you know, but if you have a sold out show the next night.  It's a lot of money you're throwing away, so.  Yeah, it's one of those things where.  You got to make damn sure.  You know, if people are going to see Mooney, even though he can offend people, obviously, but, you know, you know you're going to see Paul Mooney.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, it's Paul Mooney.  He's not surprising anybody by saying something that's going to make a piece of the audience uncomfortable. 
[00:19:30]  That's what he does.  It's not like it was Brian Regan.  Right, exactly, where it was a total shock.  You sort of know what you're getting as you walk in the door, you're right.  I don't think it, it doesn't matter, though, in this day and age.  It's terrible.  I know.  Yeah, but it's sad that it's entering the comedy clubs now.  Yeah.  I don't see Mooney necessarily apologizing for this either.  No.  Nah.  I don't think Paul really does like white people.  I think he's got mixed feelings.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think he hates white people.  He's been dealing with white people his whole career, but, you know, he's also, you know, he has a lot of unpleasant memories. 
[00:20:00]  From that era.  Yeah.  German shepherds and fire hoses.  Okay, there's another tweet.  Oh.  All right.  A Twitter user alleged that the comedian said, quote, white people in Boston deserved what they got, and it was okay to lose a few limbs, and as long as no blacks got hurt, it was okay.  But that's, I mean, that's another tweet.  But that's probably paraphrasing a joke or something, because you wouldn't, I don't think you would stand there and for. 
[00:20:30]  I think he's just trying to be outrageous.  But you, it's, it's, I guarantee you there's more to it.  You don't just say, as long as no black people got hurt, unless you're saying it completely sarcastically and just being an ass.  Yeah, that's what he's telling me.  I could see him, like, laughing after that.  Like, as long as no black people got hurt.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  You can lose a few limbs, you're fine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, hopefully we'll get him on today.  Is he talking? 
[00:21:00]  I'm sure he is.  He's, he doesn't care, so.  I think we're working on getting him on as well.  Yeah, I don't think Moody's gonna, you know.  Roland will give us updates on two of our potential guests.  Roland.  Roland is fine.  Especially AJ Clemente.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fucking great.  I wish I had married Chelsea Clinton.  She's getting a big apartment.  Is she?  Yeah.  Ten million dollar apartment.  Yeah, where did she get the money from?  Her fucking parents are rich, bitch.  Oh, they're rich.  I know. 
[00:21:30]  I'm rich, bitch.  Yeah.  And her place has the longest hallway and what?  Oh, everyone's showing it.  Yeah, Imus is showing it on his show now.  But I think they're all.  They're beeping it.  It's like so weird.  Yeah, but they're all behind.  Yeah.  This was yesterday's video.  Right.  They weren't showing it yesterday, right?  Not really.  You know, Jimmy Kimmel was all about it last night.  Because that's the clip we saw.  Oh, of course.  Imus's face.  I don't like it.  Imus just looks weird.  He's in shock. 
[00:22:00]  We don't have the audio up.  But his face is great.  He's playing the AJ Clemente clip.  He's laughing.  Can you, someone grab this?  We need this.  I want to see how I mishandled the clip.  They're all cracking up.  Warner Wolf, they're all laughing.  Right.  Oh, this poor guy.  See if that clip is worth playing.  I want to see how Imus handled that.  Jesus.  Poor fucker.  Yeah.  That's a tough spot. 
[00:22:30]  What do we know on the Boston bombing situation?  I hope this kid can never talk again.  I love the fact that he's already talking.  Is he talking and writing stuff down?  He said no.  So they said that he has, you know.  I think he mouthed it.  Yeah, I don't know if his voice box works.  I heard he said it.  I heard that he said no.  Oh, really?  Maybe not as clearly as we say it, but supposedly, yeah, that's what I heard.  Huh.  So they think he'll be able to, you know, talk a little bit.  At some point.  At some point. 
[00:23:00]  At some point.  And they really think that it's self-inflicted gunshot.  To the throat.  Gunshot wound, right?  Yeah.  To the throat.  Fuck that up.  Don't you?  Shouldn't you go by the side of the temple?  I think.  I think the best way is to go in the mouth and point it up.  But that's hard, man.  You better be committed.  Yeah.  Because that bullet is going to tear through your soft palate of your mouth.  Jesus.  And up through your sinuses.  Wow.  You better make sure it works, too.  You better get a desert eagle.  Because then you get that fucking, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  You get that, those people, the unsuccessful suicide attempt.  And their face is gone.  And they're still alive.  Yeah.  It's like, wow, how did that improve your life?  Oh, you got to just go for that.  How are you feeling now?  Yee.  That's fucked.  Yeah.  But, uh.  Jesus.  They officially charged him.  Yeah, yeah.  They charged him with, uh, actually having a weapon of mass destruction.  The old crockpot. 
[00:24:00]  Full of dynamite.  With his explosives.  I was watching CNN, and they were basically saying how easy it is to build  one of these things.  Yeah.  They kind of, they didn't officially show you.  Yeah.  But they sure got in a lot of people's heads how easy this is once again.  Yeah.  And then they actually did, uh, uh, fire went off in, like, the desert.  Yeah, see what kind of a blast that makes.  It was pretty fucking impressive.  Yeah, it's pretty fucking, uh. 
[00:24:30]  But why are they, it's actually pretty easy.  Why are they saying how easy it is?  I don't know.  Why, why are they doing that?  What should you get online?  If you're a bomber, you could fucking, you know.  Well, but then you got.  You pretty much can get whatever you need.  Then you got those fringe people.  Yeah.  That, you know.  Oh, I could maybe do this.  That's what I'd worry about.  You bring more people to the party.  We used to screw together pipe bombs as kids.  Did you really?  Yeah, we'd fucking shove them in people's big fences.  We'd just go with the M-80s. 
[00:25:00]  No, we would take M-80s.  We would just get dumb M-80s and we thought we were cool blowing up a mailbox here and there.  Well, if we'd poke screwdrivers in the sides of the M-80s and dump the gunpowder out.  And then you get a pipe with two end caps.  You wrap Teflon tape around the threads so they don't, like, the friction doesn't fucking blow you up.  And then you drill a little hole in one for the fuse.  And then you just fucking fill it up with all the gunpowder.  You put, like, fucking 30 M-80s in there.  And then you screw the top on. 
[00:25:30]  You put a fuse in.  You take a cigarette.  You break off the filter.  And then you put it on the fuse.  Right.  So the cigarette has to burn all the way down.  And then the fuse lights so you get really far away.  You shove it in between a big, like, 4x4 post on a fence.  And then just go away and watch the whole fucking fence.  Like, an entire section.  The post fucking flies in the air.  It's like a movie.  Here's my question.  You did this before the internet.  How the fuck did you figure out how to build a pipe bomb? 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  All my friends, we just knew how to do it.  I'm sure.  As a kid, you just fucking figure it out.  I'm sure it would take us less than a minute to, you know, find that on the internet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's, like, old school.  It is old school.  Like, how did you know?  Who came to you with this and said, look, let's build this thing?  I have a friend, Dave, who worked at a fucking place where you could get pipe and stuff.  Did you guys just experiment a little bit?  We had the M-80s.  You just kind of know if you, you know, pipe bombs have been around for a while. 
[00:26:30]  You just kind of know that you make a pipe bomb that way.  I don't know how.  The internet is like being friends with Anthony.  That's all the internet is.  It's just, like, knowing him.  We fucking fired off M-80s and blew up mailboxes.  We thought we were cool.  I can't even imagine you could even do that nowadays without, like, the authorities freaking out.  They'd freak out and then, fuck, you'd get the bomb squad out there.  And that was just dumb high school shit.  Yeah.  Yep.  But you built pipe bombs.  Yeah, we used to play around with all kinds of shit like that. 
[00:27:00]  That's amazing.  That was fucking having fun as a kid.  Right.  You realize, you know, you're lucky getting out of there without losing any hands or legs or lives.  But that was just, like, part of growing up in the suburbs as a kid.  You just blew shit up.  No, I understand all that.  It's weird, you know?  I understand all that, but just getting the knowledge.  Yeah.  How old were you?  Probably anywhere between, you know, 16, 17, 18.  And you knew how to build a pipe bomb.  Around there.  That amazes me. 
[00:27:30]  Me, Dave.  Joe Curry was along for the fucking festivities, my brother.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  In the suburbs, you get bored, and when you're out at night and there's nothing really going  on, you just kind of got to figure out what to do.  And around the 4th of July back then, it sounded like fucking Vietnam.  Of course.  You know?  Weeks before the 4th.  No, I know.  You were hearing, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  But that's why, you know, there were available M-80s around.  Now I don't even know where the fuck you get M-80s.  Mm-hmm.  It's crazy. 
[00:28:00]  But you were able to ramp it up and go to the next level with all of it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We had to fucking piss her with that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So you think this kid gets the death penalty?  No.  No.  There's no way he is put to death.  There's no way.  No.  Because watch, they're going to start leaning on the fact that his older brother was the  mastermind behind the whole thing, and he was more of a follower.  And in the end, I think that's good enough to save this kid's life.  Yeah.  Any kind of state charges, obviously, Massachusetts doesn't have the death penalty. 
[00:28:30]  And then you get your federal charge, which does carry the death penalty.  And McVeigh went to, had the death penalty.  He was killed.  But he wanted it.  You know, he didn't even fight the death penalty.  Yeah.  So that's a different story.  You get a lawyer that fights it.  They are not going to want to fucking kill this guy.  I think it's going to be really, really tough.  I think in the end, it's going to be really tough.  But his whole defense is going to be, my brother made me do it. 
[00:29:00]  He fucking influenced me.  He pressured me.  The Lee Boyd Malvo defense.  Yeah.  Up to, I mean, up to the entire, they're going to go as hard as saying, he fucking, you know,  threatened me.  He coerced me.  It's not just going to be an influence thing.  It's going to be a, you do this or, or, his life was being threatened.  Right.  So you're going to definitely see some wrangling as far as his defense goes.  You're absolutely going to get that doubt as far as, you know, putting him to death.  Plus, he'll cooperate.  Yeah.  If he cooperates and starts talking about the sleeper cell or whatever, they won't. 
[00:29:30]  Well, they're already saying.  They're already saying that there's no sleeper cell, that they acted alone.  How the fuck, first of all, so quickly, based on nothing but his word, he said, no, that  they are announcing that there is no ties to any outside organization because it's self-serving  for the administration.  It totally is.  It is creepy how fast we get this info.  How about, how about we sit on what he's saying for a couple of days and then fucking decipher 
[00:30:00]  it and investigate it.  Yeah.  Investigate it.  See if there's anything else there.  Go, you know, at least go through every single item in the, uh, in the apartment.  This fucking administration is so dead set on not having any terrorism happening on their  watch that they change the definition of terrorism.  They fucking juggle the facts around.  They're so afraid to acknowledge that it still exists under this guy's fucking watch.  It does. 
[00:30:30]  It happens.  Look what happened in fucking Canada.  Look what was brewing there yesterday.  They, uh, had an announcement that, uh, Canada and the U S, uh, uh, uh, mostly Canada.  Thank you, Canada.  A foiled terrorist attack.  But we were going to have a taste of that.  They keep saying Canada, but they were going to blow the train up over Niagara Falls.  Yeah.  That's our territory.  Be trained.  So Canada, who avoids all this stuff, who stays out of it, who tries to be as neutral  as they can.  And it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It just doesn't matter.  It was thwarted though. 
[00:31:00]  Thwarted.  They were going to attack.  I love that word.  Oh yeah.  It was thwarted.  And it was Al Qaeda.  Of course it was.  Fucking animals.  That was Al Qaeda.  What's the story?  They were just going to blow up the train?  Blow up a bridge.  Oh, a bridge.  I thought it was when the train was going over.  No, I understand that.  I thought it was, I thought it was going to be on the train itself, but they were going for  the bridge.  Yeah, they wanted to blow up an entire bridge and the train to affect commerce on that line.  Which bridge?  I don't know.  It's one though that goes into New York.  Was it in Amtrak?  I think so. 
[00:31:30]  But it would definitely affect trade between us and, you know, the terrorism aspect.  It's just, but no one wants to fucking acknowledge that there's still terrorism and it's affecting  us.  No, Benghazi, no, it's fucking people didn't like the movie.  Yeah.  You ever walk out on a movie and you get angry because it sucked?  Yeah, that's what it was.  That's what it was.  Oh, that, the, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, these two guys in Boston.  Yeah, they're just religious fanatics, but acting on their own. 
[00:32:00]  Don't worry.  Oh, the guy went to fucking back to Russia a year ago and fucking, you know, we don't  know who he saw, what he talked to, who he fucking was influenced by, but we'll just  decide right now based on this kid's fucking.  Nodding in the hospital bed that no one was really, no one else was involved.  Jesus Christ.  Are we all this stupid?  Hey, can, can you calm down?  Yeah.  You got, you, you got a nice day coming.  Yeah?  Yeah, with the Netflix stock. 
[00:32:30]  Oh my God.  I saw you tweeting.  Waiting.  Every time you get angry today, I'm just going to say Netflix.  Netflix.  That's going to calm you down.  Netflix.  Yesterday, I was like, I was looking at Apple and I was, fucking Apple has been crazy.  Up and down.  It stinks.  It stinks.  It stinks.  It was up to over 700 bucks a share and it's, uh, it's just plummeted since then.  Um, now they are going to be announcing earnings, Apple.  So I was thinking maybe I should get back in, but it's like crap shoot. 
[00:33:00]  You don't know what the fuck they're going to announce.  So it could go up.  It could go down.  I don't know.  So then I was like, Netflix, you know what?  Everyone I fucking know is talking about Netflix and what they saw on Netflix and the original  programming on Netflix and whatnot.  So I'm like, and they're announcing earnings today.  So let me get in and buy some fucking may call options on Netflix.  So I did it.  And then the market closed.  They announced earnings were fucking huge. 
[00:33:30]  And the stock went from 170 a share to about $217 a share overnight in the aftermarket.  So I'm waiting for the market to open and I will dump my fucking Netflix options and pocket  a tiny little show.  Why would you, like, how come if you save them, it might go down again?  Yeah, I don't want to fucking deal with it.  And they're short term options.  I'm not going to let them run out.  So they're, they're May, May 3rd options.  So they expire on May 3rd.  I can't fucking juggle it around. 
[00:34:00]  I bought them and I'm dumping them.  Well, will the stock go down a little bit before you get out?  It probably will.  It will, right?  Yeah, it probably will.  But, you know.  Maybe it'll go up.  What are you doing?  It might.  It might.  It might, but it might not.  I'm not getting greedy.  Like I said, there's short term calls.  I ain't going to fuck with them.  The worst thing you can do is sit on options.  Because every day they lose value just based on time.  Like even if the stock is up, every day that goes by, since they have an expiration date, it's one more day closer to their expiration. 
[00:34:30]  So it loses its value.  Sure.  Some of its value in that way.  So, no, fuck it.  I'm on my own.  All right.  So you've got Netflix going for you today, which is nice.  Which is nice.  So back to terrorism in America.  I forgot what you were saying.  Yeah, yeah.  I did too.  No, it just seems like they're jumping the gun on this one as far as calling it that there wasn't any other outside shenanigans.  I don't like getting all that info so quickly when they're investigating. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  It's weird to me.  Why are they so willing to throw info to the press so quickly?  Because they want to get it out there to the people.  It's like.  Yeah.  And another thing.  This guy was looked at by the FBI a couple of years ago.  Interviewed by the FBI.  The FBI, the older brother.  And because they got a line from Russia that this guy might be a problem.  Right.  So they talked to him.  They interviewed him. 
[00:35:30]  The FBI.  Yeah.  Now, if Russia is saying he's an issue and he's over here, wouldn't you think it's more than just one guy that's saying,  I like fucking, you know, I like a jihad.  He's got to be connected to something.  Maybe they're bullshitting by saying that publicly.  Maybe they do that sometimes.  Like, they know that these guys are scattered.  They're like, nah, there's no ties.  I mean, they might throw out nonsense like that, too.  I doubt that this is some kind of a ploy to get more people.  It's, it's, I think it's obviously misleading the public, throwing out false information out there to make the administration look like they're much better at thwarting terrorism than they really are. 
[00:36:00]  That's been the goal of Obama's administration is to make it look like terrorism and Al Qaeda and Taliban.  It's all just fucking back burner shit.  Don't worry, people.  I'm the best.  You don't think he's done a good job with that, though?  I like what he's done with terrorism.  Fucking no. 
[00:36:30]  Predator drone strikes all over the place.  That's, you know, that's great and all, but it's not addressing the other, taking out the leadership and stuff.  It's great, but there's still a fuckload of people, the worker ants, that are still out there doing shit.  And when you're, when the most important statement you can make is that we shouldn't offend Muslim people, him and Bloomberg is another one,  saying yesterday that we have to be willing to change the Constitution and give away some of our rights for safety. 
[00:37:00]  Did he really say that?  Yes, he did.  What a fucking cock sucker.  He blatantly said it yesterday.  And then on the tail end of it, he's saying we have to be willing to give up some of our rights because of this new world we live in where we need to be safe and stuff.  In the same statement, he then said not to draw any conclusions about Muslim people and all religions should have the right to do this.  So the religions have their rights that should never be infringed upon. 
[00:37:30]  But he's asking us to give up some of our rights?  He's a fucking asshole, this guy.  We're fucking worms.  Where's that clip?  I want to hear it.  It wasn't a sound clip.  It was a statement.  A statement.  A statement, I believe.  But he's got to fucking just three terms.  Please leave.  Could you just fucking leave office?  Can he have a fourth term?  This fucking queen.  How do you know for sure?  He wasn't supposed to have a third term. 
[00:38:00]  He's getting too much shit for the third one.  Oh, the one that he just had.  The one that he got in without a people's vote.  And then the second he got in, he let the people vote on term limits on a mayor.  And they said, no, we don't want third terms.  So they're back to two terms.  So he fucked with the system to get a third term and then made it so no one else could.  Because the people's will was that they didn't want three terms for a mayor.  But he didn't go by the people's will when he got the third term. 
[00:38:30]  He went behind to all the fucking board members and fucking everyone else that's in charge.  So when are you going to make all that money with Netflix?  Oh, I'm thinking 930-ish.  Yeah.  When I punch out of this.  Yeah, nice, right?  It should be a nice haul.  I might even buy another dinosaur for my yard.  Are you thinking?  Do you have your eye on another dinosaur?  There's a dandy triceratops I've been looking at.  You're a lunatic. 
[00:39:00]  You've got a dinosaur in your backyard.  It looks so cool.  It doesn't look cool.  It looks cool.  I think it looks cool.  I've loved dinosaurs ever since I was a kid, Jimmy.  I kind of think it looks cool.  And I have.  I'm a big fan of dinosaurs.  You've got to get one of those flying dinosaurs.  Look at him.  He's hanging out in my yard.  See how cool that is?  It is kind of cool.  It's kind of cool.  You've got to get a flying dinosaur. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, like a pterodactyl?  Pterodactyl would be nice.  Get some wires and just have it hanging.  Oh, look.  He's in my yard.  Could you get one hanging above your pool?  How crap would that be?  Why not?  Because he'd just be in the wind swinging backwards.  Get some wires going and get that thing up in the air above your pool.  That would rule.  Hey, we have Imus talking about A.J. Clemente.  Still don't know if we're going to have him on our show today.  Nah, it's all right. 
[00:40:00]  But they just played the clip of the North Dakota anchor saying gay fucking shit.  Yeah.  Everybody else is on this story today.  Uh-huh.  Thanks to our fine listeners.  We had it yesterday.  It's fucking great.  Bright and early.  It's all right.  But it's very typical Imus, you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Morning, boss.  Bismarck, North Dakota.  This NBC affiliate, KFYR.  They hire a new anchor.  His name is A.J. Clemente.  They already have this chick there.  Her name is Van Tu. 
[00:40:30]  Here is how his career there started.  They have this big introduction.  Here at NBC affiliate, KFYR.  And then the first word you hear out of his mouth, the woman speaks,  and then you hear profanities from this guy.  Take a listen.  You're watching the Evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News,  your news leader in high definition.  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening.  I'm Van Tu.  You may have seen our newest radio.  A.J. on NBC North Dakota News,  and he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor. 
[00:41:00]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, A.J.  Thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University.  I'm used to...  Oh, God.  What do you mean that's enough?  Profimus?  That was the best part.  I think it's the best part, him trying to say a little something about himself.  What the fuck?  I didn't realize he was on air.  He didn't realize.  And then the more he speaks, the more you see that he appears to have had some sort of a head injury 
[00:41:30]  because he sounds really, really stupid.  Jesus.  Which sort of, I guess, maybe explains it or maybe not.  But check it out.  It's all over the Internet.  It's online.  And by the way, he got fired.  Right.  Got fired.  Bottom line.  First words out of his mouth.  First show.  Well, Connell told me about this yesterday.  Right.  And so you wanted to let the tape run longer so that we could hear how stupid he sounds. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, well, we have a 32-second clip.  And you can even see it, boss, if you want.  We have a video of it if you want to see it.  Yeah, I do.  Hey, run it for the Iron Man, Tom, please.  Your news leader in high definition.  Gay.  Good evening.  I'm Van Q.  You may have seen our new host, AJ, on NBC North Dakota News.  And he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, AJ. 
[00:42:30]  Thanks, Van.  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University.  And I'm used to, you know, from being from the East Coast.  Okay, well, welcome aboard, AJ.  Thanks.  Go for it.  A fatal ATV crash happened yesterday in Williams County.  That's the best part.  Tell us a little bit about yourself.  I'm used to being from the East Coast.  I'm used to being.  Tell us a little about yourself.  The guy just cursed.  Poor bastard.  The first thing you do, you bastard.  Oh, poor bastard. 
[00:43:00]  I'm used to being from the East Coast.  And then, Ryan, tell us a little bit about yourself right after you.  He cursed.  I'm out of the gay fucking shit.  Yeah.  Poor bastard.  He's the first.  He's the first.  He really is.  He's the first.  He's the first.  He's the first.  It's his first words ever spoken.  On his first show.  You know, when I go around the country and I see these local news teams, they really are,  some of them are, it's really like a petting zoo.  I mean, you really got some, you got people who are on television, and we've talked about 
[00:43:30]  it before, but there are people who, you don't know why they even got in television.  Like they came straight from Mickey D's to the newsroom.  Just like that, but it's people who should be doing something else, because there'd be  somebody, they always have some kind of physical tic, you know?  Oh, sad.  A wandering eye or a lisp or a, or like this guy who's clearly, you know, he's had head  trauma, so he's terrified to be behind in Bismarck. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, well, 23 until the hour.  Well, we're so far behind now.  Don't we have KT McFarland coming out?  We've got to stop.  Come on.  We've got to do spots here.  Oh, fuck, man.  That's great.  Legs.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Poor bastard.  He's a poor bastard.  Tell us a little bit about yourself.  You can't recover from gay fucking shit. 
[00:44:30]  I think in the mic, they said, you're going out live.  Your mic is live.  Yeah, and he's like, yeah, that pop-up was the best.  And he thinks about what he said.  Oh, my God.  Did I say, oh, no.  It's a gay fucking shit.  I'm used to being from the East Coast.  And he did a terrible job with the stories.  Oh, yeah.  You see the video that's going viral?  Well, it started going viral a lot yesterday.  They'll probably start playing it tomorrow on Mainstream Media.  Will Sasso. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  The fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger driving thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Will Sasso puts out some funny videos.  He figured out how to do Vine videos correctly.  Yeah, yeah.  And then someone put, I guess he did, he put all the Vine videos together as a little montage  and made a solid YouTube video that's on Gawker.  And this thing is going to do extremely well.  Yeah, I'm driving.  Yeah.  Come on, go.  This is bullshit.  Come on, look what you're doing.  Yeah, hi. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, hi.  Where am I?  Fuck you.  Sweet Caroline.  Yeah, look at this.  It's like a movie set.  The alien space station maze killing aliens.  Pew, pew.  He's just driving.  Pause.  We really need to set this up.  This is so fucking good.  Yeah.  It's just him behind the wheel.  You just occasionally see his hand pop out in the windshield.  Right.  But he's just talking about what's going on outside his vehicle as he's driving. 
[00:46:00]  Right, and I think it works this way with the iPhone, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  An iPhone or maybe a GoPro?  Landscape.  Uh-huh.  What do you mean, landscape?  Yeah, I think it works in landscape.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Which is, you know, it's rare to say that, but I think for this particular bit, it absolutely works.  Gives it more of a phone look.  Right, right.  You don't want that wide, you don't want it kind of narrow.  No, but it definitely works.  So, yeah, all you see is his hand pointing at things, and at one point he has just a cigar as he's driving. 
[00:46:30]  Let me see the rest of this.  It's parts 1 through 14.  Wow.  Of Arnold Schwarzenegger driving.  Right.  Yeah, they were all individual Vine videos, but I think it really works as a montage.  Somebody else put them together and uploaded it to YouTube, and then they got the 1.6 million.  Oh, wow.  Oh, it's still him, sir.  Eh?  Yeah, look at this tree.  Yeah, look at this here. 
[00:47:00]  It's like we're back in the movie.  Set the aliens.  Space station maze.  Shoot the aliens.  Pew, pew.  That's not the parking spot.  Look at this weird piece of shit.  Come on.  Are you talking to the van?  What are you?  Yeah, it's funny.  We do okay.  Reverend BlueJeans.  Hey, what the heck?  Talk man, make up your mind.  Yeah, watch this.  Hey, I'm pulling you over.  Yeah, it's funny, because it's the other way around, you know?  That's all I have to do to get to my destination is to turn right here.  I know. 
[00:47:30]  That's what I just said.  Yeah, look at the name of this street here.  It's called Dick Street.  That's hilarious, because it's the name of the dicks.  Yeah, this parking garage is like the end of the alien space station movie.  Grab the bomb.  Get out in time.  Boom.  Oh, look.  It's a Honda Accord.  More like Honda, according to Arnold.  You should get out of the way.  Come on.  Yo entiendo ingles un poquito.  Yo, Nintendo's a gay taquito.  I'm so good at Spanish. 
[00:48:00]  That's fucking funny, man.  Will Sasso.  Bravo.  Fucking bravo.  Yeah, he's really jumped all over Vine, huh?  Yeah.  Didn't he play Curly, the Stooges?  He did.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  He's in the Three Stooges, Mad TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does those videos with the lemons.  He's like choking on lemons, and they fly out of his mouth.  It's so weird and out of context.  I don't know if I've ever seen that. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, he does a whole shitload of lemon videos.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess this is a compilation, because that's what he started with.  Yeah, the lemons.  Yeah, I've heard...  Oh, God.  It doesn't matter what I have to say.  This is a montage?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll try that again.  I'll try that again.  I'll try that again.  I'll try that again.  I'll try that again.  Homemade almond milk. 
[00:49:00]  Water.  Almond.  Lemons.  Lemons!  It's just fucking...  It's ridiculous.  But he found an angle.  That's right.  It just puts the lemon on.  Yeah, an entire lemon. 
[00:49:30]  Can I get a Will Sasso?  Right, because...  I don't even know where a maniac lives.  Make a left on citrus, haven't you, brother?  Tidges!  Okay, I'll take it.  Now I'm in on the cold hotline. 
[00:50:00]  Which one?  The TV show with Klugman and Randall?  No, the movie with Matt Bell and Lemmon.  We didn't even describe it because it's so fucking funny.  Just put it on our Facebook page for the people who haven't seen it.  I never saw that.  I heard of those videos.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  We'll have that up there in a second for you.  It's ridiculous.  And we'll have the Arnold Schwarzenegger up there as well.  It's very hard to be funny and creative in six seconds.  Right.  So you've got to find your niche.  He figured it out.  He figured something out at least.  I'm going to start doing that with grapes. 
[00:50:30]  What?  I'm going to start doing that with a little bit more.  I'm going to start doing that with a good story.  I'm going to start doing that with a little bit better.  Well, when you're sitting there  In yourself a poster chair  Talking to some rich folk that you know 
[00:51:00]  Well, I hope you won't see me  In my ragged company  Well, you know I could never be alone  Take me down, little Susan  Take me down  What's this for? 
[00:51:30]  Underground  You like the stones?  Yeah, this is one of my favorites  Dead flowers or like dead flowers?  Nah, all sticky fingers?  Nah  Just a little anniversary for sticky fingers  Oh yeah?  1971 on this date  71  71  Oh  42 years ago  It's a fucking medley we're getting here  It sure is  Why do you go with dead flowers before the big time hit? 
[00:52:00]  Just a little something different  Oh  Fair enough  Iraq's mixing it up as they say  You get the hit and the deep track  Yeah  All in one  It's two for Tuesday  Nice  Nice  On your home of rag and roll  The Rolling Stones  God damn, is that good? 
[00:52:30]  Hey Iraq  Doctors saying that the cinnamon challenge is no good  Finally  Finally  And we try to, you know, we try to warn the kids 
[00:53:00]  Recently we were trying to warn the kids  The kids  Because it became a thing  And we were here to say  Man  You could fucking die from this shit  Yeah  We didn't know at the time when Iraq did it  Can we go to that video real fast?  Oh  It's so terrible  Saying it can collapse your lungs  Yeah man  Oh yeah?  And you did  This is five years ago already  Five and a half you have to say at this point  Look at Bobby  Good old Bobby  So a big huge teaspoon of cinnamon 
[00:53:30]  And Iraq said, fuck it, I'll do it  And it was a scary, scary moment  It was really fucking scary  He was coughing, turning red  He couldn't breathe  Iraq, did you feel like you were in trouble?  Yes  Respiratory distress  I think by my eyes turning red  And my face turning purple  Yeah  Everyone else could figure that out as well  Yeah  You just couldn't breathe, right?  You couldn't get air  No, it formed a pace  And just blocked your airways 
[00:54:00]  Oh my god  Was that the worst thing we ever did to you?  Yeah, I think that's pretty much the worst  The worst thing we ever did to you  I don't know  The mayo thing was bad  No, no, no  When we blew out your eyes  Yeah, we did blow out your eyes  We blew out your eyes pretty good  Yes, but the difference is  Is that I didn't control the cinnamon going into my mouth  Bob Kelly shoved it down to the back of my throat  Oh, Bobby  That's true  If Bobby just placed it in there nicely  We would have been alright  I don't think it would have been as bad  But then again, we would have this great video  What about the lemon juice in the eyes? 
[00:54:30]  Grapefruit juice  Oh, grapefruit juice  It hurts, but that wasn't worse than that  What about waxing  And then you falling off  And smashing your head on the toilet  That was accidental  That was ripping out your armpit hair  And he fell and hit his head  Into the metal toilet paper holder  With the sharp edge  Was that great?  That's why I'll always defend E-Rock in the end  They're the fucking guys but a soldier  Oh, E-Rock  What else did we do to you? 
[00:55:00]  You had a hot chick punch me square in the stomach  I forgot about that one  When they were auditioning  The K-Rock girls that never did anything  Oh, right  What else did we do?  The hot wax shots  What else did we do?  I'm starting to forget now  You had to smell a lot of bad things too  Yeah, most from Jim  Oh, I kind of like  And boss  I kind of liked the peanut butter hat myself  That's because we were bored  I know  There was no real reason for that  Or the Wonder Woman costume 
[00:55:30]  With the fluff and utter hat  Right  That was just something to kill time  Until we were done with K-Rock  No, but you had to smell  Remember Big A spit that stuff onto a spoon?  Oh, yeah  And you bring  Tongue scrapings  Tongue scrapings  And you've smelled a lot of assholes  And you've smelled some horrible things, dude  What was the worst thing you smelled?  As far as assholes go  Probably Tippy Tom  Tippy Tom?  He smelled all right, dude  He had the foot, too  That had worms in it 
[00:56:00]  Got worms  Did he have worms in his foot?  He had some kind of like  Little maggot  Kiara M from Brooklyn  Sorry?  Yeah  Yeah, sure  Put that on  Remember how hot she was?  Yeah, wowee  Do you like spanking, guys?  Yeah  Have you done it really?  You ever spit in somebody's mouth?  Maybe  Nice  Put this on our Facebook page  Oh, wow  Those are the K-Rock girls  How's it been in a place  Normally piglets would be suckling?  Never  Not as hard as you can 
[00:56:30]  Not as hard as you can  Holy crap  Oh, God  Wow  She fucking did a good job there  Oh, man  Holy fuck  Oh, my God  You all right?  You're wrong  Yeah, that hurt  That was a good punch  That was a good punch  She wound up  I'm sure they weren't allowed  To come over to our XM studio  You know, because K-Rock  Needed to have control  Of everything  That was fucking irritating  And never did anything with them 
[00:57:00]  No, why would they?  Really?  They're supposed to be  Like our promo girls  Going out to every event  And handing out O&A stuff  And K-Rock stuff  They never did anything  Yeah  All right  So the cinnamon challenge  Doctors saying  Basically, do not do this thing  Yeah  We did it a very long time ago  And we did try to warn the kids  Over the years  Yeah, you can collapse your lungs  And burn out your throat  Here it is  Fuck it off 
[00:57:30]  You rock is a  Slow motion  It's just dust  You look really frightened  I don't know what the fuck  What the fuck is coming out of him?  What?  You rock, you rock  You're like that old wrestler 
[00:58:00]  Oh my god  Holy shit  See, you're coughing it out there  Drink a little water  Water  Water, water, water, water  Water was the worst thing to do  Through your nose, fuckface  You're right  Oh, God  Can you pause for a second?  He's heaving  Bobby's fucking demented  We're all pretty much in like  Oh, fuck  We went way too far  And he's saying what?  Breathe  Breathe through your nose  Fuckface 
[00:58:30]  Fuckface  Wow  Because Bob didn't have to worry  About getting fired  Right  Bob could just enjoy  You rock suffering  There was a point  I was worrying  We were going to get thrown in jail  Because he dies  Because of this thing  Bobby would have went to jail  On that one  Because he administered the  Yeah  We all would have been  Oh, yeah  We would have gone to the bus  No problem  You can also see Travis  You can also see Travis  Jumping and laughing  Dancing and laughing  Behind him  Yes  Because at first we didn't know  We thought it was hilarious  And then  It changed, though 
[00:59:00]  I remember everyone  We all were looking around  Just going  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Please breathe  Please breathe  Please breathe  Yeah, yeah  All right  Continue  This is the most horrible thing  I've ever seen  Drink water  Drink water  Drink water  Drink a little water  Something just came out  Of his forehead  It's Travis laughing  Wow  Damn  You have to breathe 
[00:59:30]  Like you give a breath  See, you just thought  I'd breathe okay there  A little bit  Dude, that was fucking  He can't talk  He can't breathe  He's throwing up  Oh, E-Rock  His fucking Vic Morrow hat  Is bending on the garbage can  Is that blood?  Oh  No, it's cinnamon air  She keeps showing this part 
[01:00:00]  Over and over  But he was starting to breathe  Normally there  Yeah  Oh, my God  Look at a great studio  That?  Yeah  That's cinnamon  That's cinnamon  All right  You're okay  Well, once again  It doesn't work  You can't  You can't do that  Did he have water?  You can't eat it  Wait  You know  The board is  Really dry  Shut the fuck up  Yes, he did  Oh, there he is  Poor E-Rock 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  Collapse a lung  Damn  What, from coughing so hard?  And ingesting it, too  I guess it burns  The cinnamon burns out  Whatever lining is in  In your lungs  Oh, God  Oh, yeah  Fucking  Try me a river  Wow  You'd think  You wouldn't need a doctor  To tell you that  There's a lot of videos  On  Online that  You could watch 
[01:01:00]  That really kind of show  It's probably not that good for you  When your body rejects something  Yeah  Because it doesn't want it  Yeah, exactly  Yeah  What are they saying about the  Yeah, cinnamon is made from tree bark  It contains cellulose fibers  That don't easily break down  Oh  It could cause scarring in the lungs  How about mesothelioma?  No kidding  And the number of poison control center calls  About teens doing the prank  Has increased dramatically  From 51 in 2011 
[01:01:30]  We did this way back in  Yeah  What year was that?  Seven  Seven  2007  So they got 51 people calling  In 2011  And 222 last year  It's amazing  Because the videos all say it's bad  Yeah  Like not one video is fun  Like a guy's doing that  Right, right  And it looks good  Yeah  Unbelievable  Un-fucking-believable  There you go  We won't be doing that again  Oh god  E-Rock 
[01:02:00]  That was a scary day  How's the movie coming, E-Rock?  You working on it?  Uh, slowly but surely  But surely  Yeah  Little bits here and there  Are getting written  What are you up to?  I think the second  I guess it's  I'm still learning how to  I don't want to say map it out  But like  Format it?  Yeah, format it  He hasn't written anything  Since we last asked him  I have  That's the answer  We have  But I just  Who's we have?

[01:03:00]  Than I do  What has he come up with  So far  That you're like  Oh that's a good one  Fact checking  Some of the things  I was doing  Fact checking  It's a time travel movie  I know  But some of the stuff  I was writing  Apparently weren't  In certain periods  That's what you want to do  Your first movie  A period piece  What did you do  That was inaccurate  What was something  You wrote that was inaccurate  Something  It was  Something music based  That was actually  A lot earlier  Than where  The character was  I was listening to  A Beatles tune  In the 30s  I look forward to 
[01:03:30]  Seeing this on the big screen  I know  I'm getting psyched  You should have talked  To Chris Columbus yesterday  I should have  Yeah  He's  Made your dream come true  That's right  He was really good  I totally had a different idea  Of what he would be like  He was chilling  Very funny  Very funny guy  Someone was saying  We gotta check out  The condom challenge  What is the condom challenge  If I can keep my dick hard  If I can keep my dick hard in one  I've failed every time  I hate those things  They're terrible  They're criminal  They really are 
[01:04:00]  Never minded the condom  Oh good  Oh god  I wish I didn't mind it  Never minded it  You could fuck this  Comfortably with a condom  No problem  Wow  Never minded it  It doesn't feel as good  No  It just doesn't feel as good  You gotta snort a condom  Up your nose  And out your mouth  Oh  And a lot of the kids  Are doing this today  This is the big one  Yeah  With a dick in it  But this is  This is Glozell though  Yeah Glozell did it

[01:07:00]  Chris Angel did that  For us with what  What did he use  Back then  String  Was it just a string  Yeah  The string eyeball thing  Is always my favorite  Yeah  Anytime I  Think of him  I think of his fail  Yeah  With the string  He had a string  And like he pulls a string  Out of his eye  Right  And it's supposed to be amazing  But where does the string start  Did he  Did he snort this  I think he snorted  The  Yeah he did something  He put it in his mouth 
[01:07:30]  Or snorted it  Something  And then he  And then he pulls it  Out of his eye  It's amazing  Right  But the thing is  He has it fucking  Like coiled up already  And shoved in his lower eyelid  Right  And uh  It's there  The whole time  Right  That he's talking  Until he does the trick  Right  So he starts  Pulling it out of his eye  And the whole clump  Yeah  Of coiled up string  Just fell out  And he like  Quickly like  Like tried to extend it  And be like  Ah  Ah  See 
[01:08:00]  That's stupid  Right  Gets millions for that  Millions  It's getting millions for uh  Tricks that kids are now  Doing on the internet  Yeah  I admire the fact that  Anybody would put that  In their eye  I know  That's easy  Oh no way  It's gotta hurt  No way  It looks like string  Fuck that man  Make it all red  And fucking hurt  Like you got  You put it right in the corner  Oh  Oh no  No way dude  It was hard enough  To put contacts in  And I had years of practice  Yeah  Oh I hate anything in my eye  I was watching that show 
[01:08:30]  Brain Games last night  On Smithsonian  Uh  It's like you know  They're like  Alright  Let's see if you can notice this  Or  Here's a test  Uh  Just try to see  How many times  Uh  We change  The food  On these people's plates  Pay attention  And count  I got everything wrong  I was sitting there  Like I'm a fucking retard  Did you?  Yeah because then  After it's done  It's like  Well  Did you count how many?  And I'm like  Yeah I fucking got that one  Well we didn't want to know that 
[01:09:00]  Did you notice the bunny  Walking in the background?  No  I was counting  I hate those things  They're so annoying  I know  They're meant to just  Fuck with your head  I was like  Can you show me one?  There was one where it's like  Uh  Alright we're gonna show you  From the sideline  But that's not fair  If they're telling you  What to do  I know  Okay  That's why that shit's not fair  It was annoying  They should say  What's going on here  And then  Toward the like  Like the next show  And the next  Because they did like  Three in a row 
[01:09:30]  Right  I started not paying attention  To anything they wanted me to  Right  And I'm just looking at shit  In the background  Right  And then I'm missing  What I was supposed to be  It's like a crap shoot  There was one where they had  A football  A kicker  And a field goal  And you were on the sideline  Like probably at the  Maybe the 30 yard line  On the side  And he's like  Let's see if you could tell  If this goes through  The uprights or not  So I'm like  Oh okay  Right  You know  It's kind of a side angle view  Sure  So they show the guy 
[01:10:00]  Kick it  And I'm looking  I'm looking  And I'm like  Yeah that went through  I could tell  You don't have me  Right  And there's cheerleaders  On the front  You know  Doing little cheers  And he's like  Did you notice  That three of the cheerleaders  Took their tops off  During the time  But they didn't  No  Because I was looking  At the football  You cock  Right  You told me to look  At the fucking football  Exactly  That's funny  There's some great  Optical illusions though  I love the optical illusion  Yeah  That's bizarre  Where you're looking  At something  And shit just disappears  Right  And then apparently 
[01:10:30]  Your peripheral vision  Is so low resolution  It stinks  Like you really  Have to focus  On something  With your eyes  And you think  Your peripheral  Is just as good  You're kind of  You know  Right  But it's only there  For like  Color  Like color  And motion  No details  So they did this thing  Where they had  A girl  Hold an X  In front of her  On a big card  And you're supposed  To shut your eyes  Then open it  Look at the X  And then shut your eyes  Again  After like  A couple of seconds  And meanwhile  They brought in 
[01:11:00]  Two girls  On either side  And you were supposed  To pick out  Which one  Was the hotter girl  One was a guy  And I fucked up  So many times  Looking  And I'm like  Welcome to the club  Jimmy's all excited  But your peripheral  Is so low res  That you couldn't  Distinguish  Looking at it  And the show's called  What?  Brain Games  Brain Games  On Smithsonian  Can you turn the volume up  Because it said  You have to view this video  Full size  Stare at it 
[01:11:30]  And look away  When they instructed to  That's where it's going to make  The whole room  All fucked up  Either that  Or a big devil face  That'll go  Bah  I hate those  No, everything's going to look like that  Yeah, it's all going to fuck up  Yeah  The sides are going to collapse  It's a very  Kind of  Spirography  Looking thing  After you stop looking at this  And look around the room  Everything you see  The sides are going to  Look like it's collapsing  Really  Yes 
[01:12:00]  I've done this one  I'm staring  You got it, Jimmy?  You going?  Yeah  It's so hard to stare at something  For a long time  I know  It goes all look away  How long?  How much longer?  It's got two balls under it  An hour and 22 minutes  An hour and 22 minutes  How long is this, Sam?  Oh, my God  To go?  No  It's good music at least  Oh, my God  Dan, dan, dan 
[01:12:30]  I'm looking  Wow  This would be good  Like on acid  Yeah  Fucking suited  Yeah  My eyes just  Switched over to  Fucked up mode  Fucked up mode  Yeah, I can feel it  Yeah  Whoa  What happened?  I don't know  What's going on?  Sam  Oh  Look away now  Whoa  Absolutely nothing 
[01:13:00]  Absolutely nothing  That was too far away, I think  Yeah  Maybe because I could see too much in my  Yeah, yeah  Oh, we suck  That shit usually works really well  I saw nice  I don't know why that one didn't work  Pick the worst one  We have to be closer, I guess  Maybe  Yeah  Works for me  It works for you  What did you see when you looked around?  Because you were closer  Yeah, like  You saw everything collapsing?  No, it's like  Toward the center  Light jets coming out of everything  Oh  I don't think that's supposed to be what happened  I want to see light jets  You don't know  Hey, can we talk about the fat pig that wasn't allowed to tan? 
[01:13:30]  We just did  I'm sorry, you're on  I didn't mean that  I'm sorry  Look at this dolt on TV  Oh, again with him  Oh  Who's that?  Oh, Bernard Kleinman  Fuck  Who's he?  He was the attorney for Ramsey Youssef in 93  Oh  Oh, I see  Yeah, of course  They're already saying that the older brother was the driving force  Of course  It seems kind of that way  That'll be the  Or  Were they making us feel that? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah  I heard about this when I was driving in  This fucking fatty  Yeah  I do think the fucking  Company should give her a fucking refund  But what's the problem?  She's too fat for the tanning beds  So basically they don't want their tanning bed busted  She bought like a membership  Right  To this tanning salon  Right  And then she got fat after?  No, I think she was always fat  They changed the rules  Yeah, I guess they changed the rules, huh?  So she goes in to tan  And they're like, no, you're too fat 
[01:14:30]  And she goes, fuck you, give me my money back  And they go, no, no refunds  That's  Why wouldn't you refund her our money?  I know  That's just bad business  Yeah  Yep  That's just  That's just bad  And what is she tanning for?  Stop it  But what kind of dummy says no to a refund  When you can't provide this  Right, yeah  They're just scumbags  Give the poor pig a refund  You don't think fat people should tan?  Don't use the sun  It's useless  That break in the tanning beds  It's useless 
[01:15:00]  Why bother?  She's not going to, you know  It's not going to gussy her up any  Maybe go for a walk when it's sunny out  Exactly  Instead of doing everything the easier way  How about that?  That's crazy  Yeah, because she's, you know  Fan people don't realize  It doesn't matter how you accessorize  It doesn't matter the fucking nice sweater  Fucking pantsuit combo that you put on  Right  It doesn't matter your hairstyle  How well you put your makeup on  It doesn't fucking matter  Because the first thing people do 
[01:15:30]  Is look at you and go  You're fucking fat  They don't go  Ooh, what pretty earrings  Your friends say that  But, you know  Their friends say that  They're also thinking you're fat  Just fucking  You're fat  I love when I see them in the stores  And they're fucking like  They're shopping  And they're holding up like a sweater  And they're looking in the mirror  It's like, don't bother  Why are you even fucking bothering?  What do you expect them to wear?  You know what?  It doesn't matter  It just doesn't matter 
[01:16:00]  Grab something  Throw it on  They're in front of the mirror  They're primping  They're fucking  You know  I see them  You know  They get their hair done  At the beauty parlor  Why?  Just run a brush through it  And go out  You're fucking fatty  It's about looking good inside  What a load of shit that is  It's about how you feel inside  What a load of shit  Just put something on  Just throw something on  That disgusting mess  You call a body  Walk out your fucking extended door  Should we play it over there? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, let's hear it  Because she's claiming  You want to play it?  Over there  Discrimination  Over here?  Okay  So we got  Fat woman  How fat is she?  Like 500?  600 pounds?  No, she's not  She's fat  No, she's too  Too fitty?  Yeah, like she's  Unfuckable fat  But she's not like  She should be smothered  With a pillow fat  Yeah, I was  Yeah, it's obvious  Yeah, it's obvious she's not  600 pounds  800 pounds?  I've never had anyone ever tell me  Ever  That I'm going to tan because of my size  Kelly McGreevy says 
[01:17:00]  Aloha tanning turned her away  He said, I'm sorry  But I'm not going to be able to let you tan today  Because we've just implemented this new policy  Where anyone over 230 pounds can't go in one of our beds  It really upset me  That's discrimination  McGreevy then asked for a refund of the nearly $70 month-long tanning package  So she could take her business elsewhere  And he said, no, we don't give refunds  Would you smell the tanning bed after she was in it?  Eek  The amount of sweat that must  No 
[01:17:30]  Gather  That's got to be horrid  No, they should give her a refund  Of course they should  I mean, really  Yeah, this place is worried about their tanning beds  But yeah, that's just bad business  There's no reason not to give her a refund  But how embarrassing  You've got to tell someone they're too fat  Yeah, hi, you're too fat  Basically, you're too fat  Yeah  Sorry  Or maybe you love telling her  Maybe he couldn't wait  Like he probably was  He came in early hoping she'd show up  Yeah, yeah  I can't wait to tell this pig 
[01:18:00]  And she wasn't even going there to tan  She was just going there for something else  And then he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Come here for a second  Yeah, let me tell you something  Bad news  Too fat for our beds  Part two  McGreevy called police  Filing a report against the owner of Aloha Tanning  Justin Heilman  I asked to see a policy  And he said, no, absolutely not  We asked to see it too  We were just curious about your weight limit policy  Well, there's a weight limit on the acrylics  It's like 230  230 pounds  Do you have that written down anywhere? 
[01:18:30]  No, we've discussed that with the people  But it's not written on the sign-up form or anything?  Uh, no  Get out of here  We have a lot of bigger people that come in here  And they know that they can't go into the lay-down beds  Because they're so, you know, they're bigger  She said only the manager could approve a refund  And while McGreevy works on that  She wanted other people to know her story  I mean, maybe there are people that have come here before  Or that are going to come here  That are overweight  And  And I just want them to know that 
[01:19:00]  You could be mistreated  I just want my money back  How about going to the gym instead of there?  Yeah, really  How about that?  Exactly  You're going to spend some time  Tanning  Take that time that you would spend tanning  And go to the fucking gym  Some people are okay with just being fat, though  Yeah  I know  They don't give a fuck  You know what, though?  They do  It doesn't bother them  It bothers us  They do  Every one of these fatties  Yeah  That say it doesn't matter  If eventually they lose the weight  And you talk to them  They say, like, oh, I was in denial 
[01:19:30]  Oh, fuck  Oh, I never liked it  I never felt good  I never  Just lose the fucking weight  But the thing is, they should give her the money back  Yeah  Absolutely  What fucking dummies  But I can't even understand that point  The acrylic has a weight limit  Yeah  When you're laying down on it  If she busts through that thing  And cuts her fat ass up on the lighting device  She'd sue  She'd sue  So, you know  Yeah, just give her her money back  You never would have heard of this  It's not discrimination  If there's a physical problem 
[01:20:00]  With you doing something  Right  But they should have it written down  It should be a written policy  Yeah  Where is this?  It's like Long Island  Akron  I don't think it is  Akron  Akron  I'm from Akron  Akron, Ohio  Yeah  So  That's where we're at  Wow  We gotta listen to Ryan Lochte  After the break  What does he say?  Well, he's the dude from that clip  Oh, of course  Where the silly anchors were laughing their asses off 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  I didn't know the reality show officially started  Yeah, I guess they had their premiere  It's so obvious that they're like  Well, he's a good looking guy  He's retarded  And he's  We found a dude  Kardashian  Uh-huh  And that's the whole thing  Is he really that dumb?  He's really fucking stupid  Yeah  Yeah, I mean  He is that dumb  He's Chris Humphrey's dumb  Ooh  Which is really dumb  I don't think Chris Humphrey's as dumb as everybody thought though  I mean  The fact that he won't let this lawsuit go 
[01:21:00]  No, it's done  Oh, is it over now?  It's officially done  What finally happened?  They just settled or whatever  Oh, okay  Literally, it just finished over the weekend  Oh, okay  Like a couple days ago  You think he got a lot of money out of her?  Oh, fuck yeah  So how dumb is he?  They do make fun of him  They make fun of him at every fucking basketball game though  Because he's an idiot  Yeah  He didn't see it coming?  No  Did she really just get married for the publicity?  I would say absolutely  It seems like it 
[01:21:30]  That's all fucked up  Yeah  She was done quick and moving on  And all knocked up  If she's still with Kanye West  Or they split  No, they're together  And she's having his baby  I know she's having his baby  Yeah, that's going to be a disaster though  In the end  That whole thing  That's obvious  You think so?  Oh, fuck yeah  Kanye will easily move on  No problem  You think there's any chance  That the baby's going to be spoiled?  Oh, Christ  And what's going on  With Kris Jenner and Bruce Jenner?  I don't know  I haven't heard  They were saying for a while  They were getting divorced  But then 
[01:22:00]  Oh, no  I didn't hear anything  Now, watch  You read the diaries?  The Kardashian diaries  From the old man  Before he fought  He wrote a lot of shit down  Did he say OJ was guilty  And I knew it?  Yeah  Yeah, no kidding  Where's that fucking page  In your diaries?  The most important page  He fucking  Did not like Kris Jenner  Whatsoever  She was supposedly  Having an affair  And he's left home  With all the kids  While she's out there  Doing her fucking thing  It's really coming to light 
[01:22:30]  That Kris Jenner  Is just a fucking  Yeah  Just a  Not a nice person  It really is odd  This family  I don't hate them  But they contribute  Really nothing  Meaning  Like  None of them are famous  For anything  Do they do anything interesting  Besides just spend money  It's called being a socialite  It's really bizarre  How people care about them  It's really strange  People don't care about anybody  You fucking throw on TV  Long enough  It's amazing  Rob Kardashian got fat  Yeah, I did  Satan's sad knows this shit  He's really fucking fat now 
[01:23:00]  I didn't realize  I stumbled upon a fat picture  Of Rob Kardashian yesterday  I've never heard of him  I've never heard of Rob Kardashian  He's the brother  But he's like  He's a fat guy now  It's amazing how  He doesn't have  It's not like he has to have a job  He doesn't have to do anything  He can't be too busy to work out  Right  Yeah, all he has to do is work out  But now he's just a fat guy  Oh yeah  He's  With his  Jimmy Kimmel sweatshirt  That's nice and snug  It's obviously an XL  Right  He's outgrowing the big sweatshirt 
[01:23:30]  That Jimmy Kimmel gave him  That's how he used to look  Just about a year ago  He's like a good looking kid  He's got tons of money  Right  He knows famous people  But no  Fuck it  He can't just do the one  All he has to do is not be fat  Yeah, he doesn't have to go to work or anything  Nope  Your whole job is to go to the gym an hour a day  How hard could that be?  No  He gave up  His life is to just not be a big fat mess  And he can't do it  Right  Alright, just don't even  Don't even go to the gym  Just don't eat pizzas and Twinkies all day long  Yeah 
[01:24:00]  I was watching a horrible fucking movie last night  That goddamn  Jungle Fever  Yeah  Oh, God  That goddamn gangster squad  That looked awful  Oh, it didn't look bad  It's terrible  And Sean Penn is great  But in that he didn't look good  Sean Penn's good  No, it's too  I think they were trying to go for a very over the top thing  You know  I think they were  Noir  So I'm not gonna  Yeah, I'm not gonna say like  It was over the top  But it was just too over the top 
[01:24:30]  It looked terrible  Yeah, really bad  Even his sound clips from it  Like his little  You know  I run this town  I just didn't buy it  It was  Yeah, it was bad  It just looked  Instead of over the top  It looked like it was just poorly acted  Right  Yeah  It was supposed to be huge  Yeah  It wasn't  Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, and Emma What's-Her-Name  That's where I noted that  Watson?  No  Emma Stone  That's where I noted that Ryan Gosling guy  He's got wacky go funny eye  Dude, he's got wacky go funny eye 
[01:25:00]  That the girls just fucking don't even acknowledge  Because they love him  But his fucking eye  Is like  He's looking one way  And the other eye  Is  Way off to one side  Oh, yeah  Dude, it's not right  You think it's a glass eye?  No  He's just got  Dead eye  He's just got go funny eye  He's got fucking lazy eye  Man  But, you know  Yeah  So the movie sucked  It was awful 
[01:25:30]  It was just, you know  And he got like fucking  What's his name there?  Brolin  Josh Brolin  Josh Brolin's in it  He's a good actor  Yeah  And fucking  Retarded Giovanni Ribisi  Mm-hmm  And it just was terrible  That's too bad  Even the action sequences  Like the shootouts  The gangland shootouts  And stuff  Were like  Who cares?  Because it just looked like  An unbelievable  And hungry shit movie  It was  And Penn is one of the best actors ever  And it just didn't look like 
[01:26:00]  A good piece of work  His accent I didn't buy  Yeah  It was awful  You know what's  The Lone Ranger  When it comes out?  Who's in that now?  That's Johnny Depp  And our buddy  Armie Hammer  Armie  Johnny Depp is playing  The engine, right?  Tonto  Tonto  Actually looks kind of badass  Any Indian groups  All up in arms  About a non-engine  He might have some  Native Americans  Got to check  Does he?  I bet he doesn't  He says he does  Is this it? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah  Holy fuck  Yeah, it looks awesome  That's wrong  Man, right?  Oh, shit  What do you do?  There  Climb down  They put him on top  Of a thing  Scaffolding  On a  He's on a  Big wooden  Old scaffolding  On a  Mountaintop  On the edge of a cliff  Tiger  O-T-I-A  Why are you talking  To that horse? 
[01:27:00]  Why am I covered in dirt?  I buried you  Oh, wow  Why am I alive?  Johnny Depp was trying to  Kind of badass  His conduct  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah  He'd talk him like this  Of seven graves  Horse says  You are a spirit walker  A man who has been  To the other side  And returned  A man 
[01:27:30]  Who cannot be killed  In battle  Something very wrong  With that horse  Holy fuck  Jerry Bruckheimer  That looks good  Yeah  Got little one-liners  In there  Yeah  We like justice  Justice  Is what I seek  Kimo Sabe  Kimo Sabe  People think you are dead  Better to stay that way  You only wear masks  There'll come a time 
[01:28:00]  When good men  Must wear masks  Let's do this  A silver bullet  All right  This looks action-packed  Yeah  You look kind of fucking awesome  Might, uh, like this  Whoa  Train coming off the rails 
[01:28:30]  That's a pretty cool shot, huh?  Yeah  No visual element  Sorry  Uh-oh  Wow  That's pretty cool  This looks pretty fucking good  Wow  They said next summer  But has the trailer been out there a while?  Is it this summer?  Oh, it has to be  It wouldn't be out there 14 months early  Yeah  It's, uh  There's no way that's that  I don't think with that  There might be a teaser  Yeah, it's out this summer  Yeah  I said next summer 
[01:29:00]  But, all right  Good  Yeah, it came out in December  All right, nice  That looks fucking good  That does look good  You think we had Armie Hammer to promote that?  I hope so  He's been, uh, cool  Yeah, he's coming back  He's becoming a big star, though  He is becoming a big star  Big action movie  Remember the, uh, original, um  Lone Ranger?  Uh, the old guy  Clayton Moore  What's that?  Yeah  Clayton Moore  Clayton Moore  And he went around, uh, dressed as Lone Ranger, right?  This is a great story  He went around dressed as Lone Ranger  But he didn't own any of the rights to Lone Ranger  Right  Uh, but he was, indeed, the Lone Ranger 
[01:29:30]  Because, uh, he's the guy that played him  And that's all he had  That's all he had in the world  In his entire life  That's all he had  Was the fact that he played the Lone Ranger  So he would go to these, uh, cons  And these appearances and whatever  As the Lone Ranger  And the most iconic thing about the Lone Ranger  Is indeed his mask  The little black mask that goes over his eyes  Uh, so  They put a lot  They sued him  And gave him a cease and desist  Saying he could not wear the iconic  Eye mask 
[01:30:00]  So he had to go out  Dressed as the Lone Ranger  With the hat  Right  And the buckskin fucking, uh, shirt  And the pants and the boots  Wearing giant, dark, cataract sunglasses  Those glasses they give old people  When they have cataracts  And need to wear the dark glasses  So he wore those  With this fucking western attire  What shithead, why would you sue the guy  Like, what a fucking scumbag  He didn't make that much money 
[01:30:30]  Playing the Lone Ranger  No  And he pushed the whole franchise  Forward for them  Exactly  Give him a break  Do you got a picture where he was  Wearing the glasses?  You look at Clayton Moore  Like he's got his fucking glasses  Now find the dark ones  There's dark ones  Dark, dark glasses  He did go with the dark glasses  For a while  Yeah, like a blackout  Look for Clayton Moore  Oh, there's a lot of pictures of him  With just, uh, different  Different types of big sunglasses on  Oh, there you go  Is that the one?  There you go  He's got sunglasses on  Instead of the mask  Oh, that's terrible 
[01:31:00]  We're fucking assholes  We just stink  Do this guy  Oh, really?  Unless he was a real dick  Yeah, you never know  But, I mean, I think they were just  Trying to protect their stupid interest  And they fucked him over  In the intro  Well, there's one where he's  Definitely a lot older  With the mask on  Maybe after a while  He won  Talking to Miss Doubtfire  And her friend  Yeah, two pigs  Look at that fucking lady  Jesus  Lone Ranger fans  Of the female variety  Are not attractive  You don't think so?  Claymore's dead, right?  Yeah, I think so 
[01:31:30]  Did he die?  Yep  I see his tombstone up there  That's a good indication  Yeah, that is  Yeah, he died in 99  99  Wow  Like it's 1999  Johnny Depp just plays weirdos now  He's like a weird guy  Disney loves him  Oh, man  He brings in the money  Pumping out some fucking chicks  To Johnny Depp  He looks great as Tonto, though  Yeah  Holy fuck  He's like ageless, that guy  He's fucking ageless  Yeah  Maybe that's why he wants to play 
[01:32:00]  All these weird roles  Because they all have makeup  And face paint  A lot of makeup  Where he can  Every character seems to have that  So maybe he's just like  One of those guys  Who doesn't want to  Johnny Depp  In Pirates of the Caribbean  I just read recently  That someone turned down that role  Fuck  I'm gonna find it  It was me  I'm gonna find it after the break  I think it was on  I think it was on BuzzFeed  Oh, what?  No, he's goofing on me  No, I just think you said  It was you  It was me  Wasn't you? 
[01:32:30]  No  There was a really  What would they offer you that?  That's a really famous actor  That turned that down  And the reason was weird, too  Oh, Denzel  The reason was weird, yeah  Johnny Depp  Shit, I didn't think  We were gonna talk about this today  I'll find it for after the break  It's just a quick one  Hmm  Yeah  Let's see  Oh  Let's see  Oh  Who?

There was a reason  Why he turned it down  Some dumb reason  Let's see  He 
[01:34:00]  Turned down the role  Long before he was  Ever made a name  For himself  Wow  Yeah, I don't know  But the movie  Probably wouldn't  Have been successful  I mean, it wasn't  Supposed to be  A big movie  Yeah, that's why  That stuff is always  Fucked up  Because they picked  The right actor  In the end  For these big time  Movies that were hits  And he just did  That Keith Richards  Impression the whole time  Which is what  He said he was doing  And that's  Right  You know  Hugh Jackman  He probably would have  Done this musical  Right  You know

[01:39:30]  And when the plane takes off at the end  You see the kid run out  And wave to the plane  Like they had to show  That he didn't do anything  Of course  Meanwhile, he would have fucking eaten the kid  Yeah  Based on what his character  Was supposed to be  Which one is Cyrus the Virus?  Oh, look out  It's fucking  Malkovich Malkovich  Oh, is that him?  Yeah, right there  Oh  Why is he all dressed different than them?

[01:40:30]  You ever hear of him?  Yes, I have  Do you know he's considered  The godfather of goth?  Wow  More people would probably be aware of that  If anybody had seen that film  The film's all right  Remember that?  The film's all right  Watch it  I did  I did watch that one  It was all right  It wasn't great  But it wasn't horrible  It was just kind of there  I had bet that he was gonna say it  Yeah  And then he said it  John Cusack is one of those actors  That does play himself in a lot of movies  Yeah  Same type of guy 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah  No matter what he's playing  He was cool, though  What the fuck?  He was fine  Yeah, yeah  I thought it was gonna be a problem  What year was this?  98, 97 or earlier?  I don't know  This is like when Chappelle was on fire  With movies and stuff  That's about right  I would say late 90s  Can you check that?  Is it earlier?  Am I crazy?  Meh  Meh  97  Fucking 16 years ago  97?  Wow  We got Ryan Lochte  A couple clips from his new reality show  And then I'm finding out  That he was on Letterman 
[01:41:30]  And Letterman beat him up  For being dumb as well  Yeah  That must be nice  Is there any way we can find that clip?  Possibly  I don't even know if it's good  I mean, it looks great in writing  It says  Letterman did have a little fun  With the 11-time Olympic medalist  Asking him  Which is your strongest stroke?  Lochte answered  Honestly, I don't know  Letterman writes  Is there someone we could call?  You might have to call my mom  What?  And then Letterman went on to ask  My God  You've been in three Olympics 
[01:42:00]  Were you aware of that?  Were you aware of that?  It's really getting around that  He's a dummy, huh?  Sam  He's retarded  The clips are good from his show?  Yeah  You wouldn't believe how stupid he is  Is he a good athlete?  He's unbelievable  He's a great swimmer  He had a pretty damn good Olympics  Absolutely  When we come back  I have a film suggestion too  That Colin turned me on to  And I know I was giving Steve Martin a beating  And then I stopped doing that  And I'm glad I stopped doing that 
[01:42:30]  Because this was a good movie with him  Oh  Well, do tell, do tell  You'll be in Anthony's show  You'll be in Anthony's show  I remember finding out about you  Every day my mind is all around you 
[01:43:00]  Looking out from my lonely room  Day after day  I like this one  Badfinger  Bring it home  Baby, make it soon  I give my love to you 
[01:43:30]  What's this?  Badfinger?  Yeah, Badfinger  Peter Hamm was the lead singer  Uh-oh  He was doing pretty well for himself  Was  Uh-oh  Oh, yeah  This reminds me of Pergamon  When I worked in Pergamon  Home Centers  Yeah  The stuff  Stuff that would play  I think  What year is this song from?  Well, I was the early 70s  Stuff that would play on the radio  Reminds me of that  Because we would have like  Light FM playing  Yeah  And what was that Gregory

[01:44:30]  By the Gregory Isaac song  No, no, not this  By the short  While he finds that  I just want to finish my thought on Badfinger  So, Peter Hamm was the lead singer  And the reason we played that song  He hung himself  Oh, wow  Oh, man  He hung himself a real long time ago  Oh  You guys  You guys  Oh, he did  When did he?  1975  Oh, man  He killed himself in 74 years after that?  Yeah, they were doing well, too, man  He was 27 years old  And we're just getting this news?  Yes 
[01:45:00]  They finally found his body  Oh  I thought he was on a big world tour  Another rock guy at 27, though  Oh  1975  They were doing well  Boy, did he fall through the cracks  Oh, man  They had a few good hits  Baby Blue was one of their hits  I believe Paul McCarty was involved with this band somehow, too, right?  Yeah, man  They had a lot of attention  Yeah, yeah  Goes and hangs themselves  While they were still a band  I believe so  I believe so 
[01:45:30]  Right, Sam?  They were still a band  And what was Paul McCartney?  He's a Beatle  Stumpfucker  They were signed to the Beatles label  Right  Apple  And Come and Get It was written by Paul McCartney  Was it?  For Badfinger  George Harrison used Ham's talents for a number of album sessions  Yeah, what the fuck?  If you want it  Here it is  Come and get it  You better hurry 
[01:46:00]  Pick your mind up fast  If you want it  Anytime  I can get it  Why are we acknowledging this then  It's just the anniversary  I guess  Oh, okay  It just sounded like a Beatles song, right?  Yeah, yeah  Kind of creepy  It was bad for us  I don't know if it's the anniversary  No  Uh-oh  After all that  It says he died on the 24th  Oh, boy  Why are we always off by a day? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, boy  Didn't we have that problem a while ago?  Yeah  That we were off by a day  What other songs are they doing?  So, tomorrow, remember this break  Dun, dun, dun  Come and get it  What other songs are they doing?  I guess a lot of people thought this was a Beatles song  Yeah  Well, day after day  Play another one  Baby Blue was a big hit for them  They needed the money  Ha, ha  Oh, yeah 
[01:47:00]  I remember this  Yeah  No matter what you are  Dun, dun, dun, dun  I will always be with you  Yeah, this is very Beatles-ish sound  What you do, girl  Go, girl  With you  Wow, it has that Beatles sound, right?  Yeah  I think the chorus, too  Sounds very Beatles-ish  With the harmonies and whatnot 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  You like this one, Jimmy?  I do  Look at Jimmy  I do  I'm doing my light FM dance  Look  Happy Jimmy  Look at him  Yeah, it's nice  Look at him  Smiley  Yeah  Nothing to say  Nothing to say  Because 38 years ago tomorrow  Who made that machine?  You don't know?  Eric?  Eat to the rock  E-Rock  The site that we get the info from said it was today  So  Maybe E-Rock just loved his last name 
[01:48:00]  Damn  Just in case people forgot his name  Yes  I remember the song, by the way  Yeah  Girl  I've been missing you  And  No, this is by Gregory Isaacs, I think  E-Rock, you got it?

Yeah  That's not a good thing  Because I was toasted  Yeah, that's not good to be called that  They would page me as that on the thing  Toast  Toast to the front  Oh my god  I like it  You were stoned?  Oh, I was fucked up, yeah  I would always go out there  I would work what they called the 12-hour shifts  And I would go back and  At Pergament  Yeah  And I would come back fucking high  Did you like your job?  There was  No, there was a guy named Terrence I worked with 
[01:49:00]  What was his nickname?  Just the black guy I worked with  Oh, I know what it was  Jesus, Anne  Oh, fuck, Anne  What the fuck?  What the fuck?

She was fuckable  I would jerk off to her all the time  Oh, yeah  But she was kind of a bitch  And, uh  My bitch  She was used to never say hello first 
[01:49:30]  Oh  And I just remember  The first time I ever heard of the song  Boom, boom, boom  Let's go  Was because she was kind of singing it  And dancing in the aisle by herself  Oh  Yeah  But it wasn't that sexy  She wanted to know a part of you  Nothing to do with it  Yeah  I can't let you go  You said you jerked off to her  Constantly  But you jerked off to  You jerked off to lawn furniture  Back then  Yeah, I was a bad  I mean, you jerked off to everything, didn't you?

[01:50:00]  The way the paint mixer's moving  Yeah  Put your balls on it  I worked in receiving  Receiving  Yeah  I did the same thing when I got sober  I went to Pergament  And, uh  When they moved to the Brunswick Shopping Center  I was a  I was a temp to hire  For Xerox in Rochester  And I also worked in receiving  And a little shipping, too  A little shipping and receiving  That was the best place in the store  Because you could smoke  You could fucking hang out and eat  Dude, we  We had a  A ping pong table  We waited around for the pallets to come in  Half our day was just sitting around  Just waiting  Shooting the shit  And then we finally would get a pallet of crap 
[01:50:30]  And have to do the whole  The paperwork on it  What was better than when a truck wouldn't show up?  Oh, it was awesome  And then you had hours  You didn't have to do anything  No  It's great  No dealing with customers, right?  No, you were in the back room  Yeah, you were in the back  Shipping and receiving was the easiest job ever  Yeah  E-Rock, you hear that song?  Yeah  Oh, wow  This is it?  Yeah  Fuck yeah  Sounds like sexual healing  I don't know this  It does, yes  Girl  It's not a bad song  But fuck, man 
[01:51:00]  I think we did this break  We did this break, didn't we?  No, well  We rocked?  I don't remember this  Oh, no  This is Pergament  Girl  I've been watching you  So I remember these fucking  Because these are the songs that we play  What year is this?

[01:51:30]  I see that look in your eyes  You don't remember this?  I heard this song  This reminds me of another song  And you know  This reminds me of another song, though  Girl  That I'm not shy  That's what I mean  It sounds like sexual healing  In the background  It does, yes  What year is this?  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, well  Oh, well  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Okay, now I remember this  I played this on CQ102 
[01:52:00]  Hit Music and More  Ah  This was a Hit Music and More song  Hey, we gotta go  Oh, well  Oh, well  We gotta go back to Peter Hamm  From Badfinger  Because the story gets better  Chris, hold on a line  I'm gonna go to Mike in New York  Real fast  Mikey  He's gonna add to what we know  About Pete Hamm  Yeah  Who died tomorrow  Tomorrow  30 years ago  Back in 1975  Not today  But we're doing our  Badfinger break today  What do you got on this, Mike?  Pete Hamm killed himself  Because his manager 
[01:52:30]  Stole all his money  Oh  Really?  Yeah  What the fuck was Paul McCartney doing?  And actually  Two of the guys  Not looking after these guys  Yeah, another member  Hung himself as well  Yep  Around the same time?  Wow  Only a year or two later  I think  So the manager  Fucking stole their money?  Yep  In what way?  How bad?  In what way?  Pretty bad  Well, they had some  And then they had none  No, what I mean is  More to the story, please 
[01:53:00]  They made a lot of money  In tours  Right  And with their  Record deal  But their manager  Twisted their deal  In such a way  That all the money  Went to him  Oh, boy  So those guys  Were basically broke  Jesus  And then he stopped  Talking to them  All together  The manager did?  Yeah  Fucking  God  Didn't get in contact  With him  Whoa  What a fuck  We haven't talked  To Bob Eatman  In a while  Why fucking  Kill yourself  Before  You kill that guy  Yeah, I know  Like, like  Kill the fucking guy 
[01:53:30]  And then, you know  If you feel so inclined  You know why?  Because of Jesus  Jesus  Jesus would not like that  Says to do not kill  Right  Yeah  You keep your eye  On your money, right?  I fucking  But if you go with  That whole thing  You're not going to heaven  Anyway because of the suicide  Plus he had a  Pregnant wife  Damn  And he leaves her  By hanging herself  What a fucking  He left a pregnant wife behind  Damn  I keep my mind  On my money  And my money  On my mind  There you go  That's right, Jimmy  That's how I answer your question  I'm thinking of letting my guy  Do my bills 
[01:54:00]  Because I literally have  No health insurance right now  Because I let it almost lapse  So I have to fucking do it today  Dude, you're going to do it today  I'm going to  Today  Today, Maury  Today  But you don't give him  Power of attorney  I would never let him  Sign my checks  Oh, he signs everything for me  What the fuck  I don't care  No way  No, of course not  I check  I learned from Billy Joel  Send it out automatically  On the computer  That's too scary  You just fucking  No, it's too scary  Does the rates change  For after health  Oh, does it?  Yeah  I don't like doing automatic billing 
[01:54:30]  I like to see what's going out  I love it  When the rates go up  I go, hey, hey, hey, hey  I'll pay it anyway  You know, I always pay it  So what am I doing?  Yeah  It's my illusion of control  I love to see it coming in  And I love to see it coming out  I do auto payments  With things that vary, though  You know  I fucking  Like my Lilco  Lipa  Lilco  What year is this?  My Lipa bill?  Yeah  That fucking automatically gets paid  Anything that varies  You go online  You fucking go to their site 
[01:55:00]  Instead of your bank site  And then you just fucking  You know  Give them the info for your account  And they just fucking  Take the money out  Yeah, I check it  Every month  I go over my statements  You do?  I hear it's convenient  I hear it's very convenient  It's so handy  I don't want to lose  Not dealing with bills  I don't want to lose  Megan from D.C.  Oh, no  Because she's got a story  About another lead singer  Oh, right  Which  This is going to make  Peter Hamm  Hanging himself  Make sense  Make sense  Go ahead, Megan 
[01:55:30]  You guys remember  Firefall from the 70s?  Hold on  Firefall  What was their big song?  What was their big hit?  Because I know  What you're about to say  So I really want to  Help set this thing up  What was their big song?  It was  You are the woman  I've always dreamed of  Oh, E-Rock  Let us get a little of that  Before you got it  Oh, damn it  Before the info on Firefall  Hold on a minute  We got  I know this one  Is this a Pergman song too, Jimmy? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, I'm sure it was  Last I've seen of my heart  Sat on my face and that's the last time  I've seen of my heart  Now, did Firefall have another hit? 
[01:56:30]  Anyone?  Were they one-hit wonder?  Megan?  E-Rock?  They had some others that were like number 11.  Number 11!  Coming in at number 11, it's Firefall. 
[01:57:00]  That's not bad.  What, E-Rock, what's another song?  Just Remember?  I Love You?  Aw.  Oh, yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Days get rainy and the nights get long in the...  I would have said this was America.  America, yeah.  Has that same sound.  It does.  Or bread.  Mmm.  Anyway.  Just remember I love you and it'll be all right, all right. 
[01:57:30]  That's the song.  It's getting very exciting.  All right, let's go for a third hit.  Do we have a third hit, E-Rock?  We're going deep.  Living Ain't Livin', Strange Way.  Strange Way?  Any of those sound familiar?  I don't know.  All right, Megan.  What do you got on the lead singer of Firefall?  Obviously a couple monster songs.  Well, there have been a lot of members of Firefall, but this was actually the guy, Larry Burnett,  who sang and wrote that big one, You Are the Woman. 
[01:58:00]  Becky Barnett.  Right.  Yeah.  And he's my UPS man.  Oh.  If you write a monster song like that, you can't be working for UPS.  He's the UPS guy?  You can't.  Yeah.  Nothing against UPS guys.  I don't know.  I could take a picture of something and send it to you, but he works in the UPS store right  around the corner from my house.  And he was the singer?  Play Strange Way, E-Rock.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  That is, that, has he told you this?  How do you know this, or just?  I knew it because another woman he worked with told me.  He doesn't really, like, brag about it, but she said to me, do you know who that is?  And she said once Bono came in to see him and that he got her tickets to some big concert  and all of this stuff.  Bono, instead of helping him out, visited him at UPS?  We know this song, too.  Is this one, turn this on?  No, I don't know.  Hold on, Megan.  Someone said I would have known this.  No, we know this one, or I know this one. 
[01:59:00]  Wait for the hook.  You know this one.  I hear the hook, yeah.  Wee.  Sign here, please.  Leave one of these stickers on the door because no one's answering, and it's a signature-only  packet.  Holy shit.  I remember this.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Now he's a UPS guy?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  What year do you think he ran out of money where he went, oh, fuck, I've got to go to  the UPS store and see if they're hiring.  What year, you think?  Somewhere in the 90s, maybe?  Previous experience.  Firefall.  Firefall.  Firefall.  All right, Megan.  Thank you for that.  No problem.  Bye.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  Colin's tweet just fucking made me physically ill.  Of course.  All right.  Welp, I have to go out.  Secret recipe for today.  One part smile, one part twinkle an eye, two teaspoons of can-do attitude.  Stir ingredients.  What an asshole.  That's great.  He sure steps out with a positive attitude.  Two teaspoons of can-do attitude. 
[02:00:30]  Of can-do attitude.  Very nice.  Very nice.  He's brilliant.  And people are saying Badfinger was the only band signed to Apple Records.  Oh, was it?  Well, that deal sucked for them in the end, huh?  Well, the Beatles were on there, too, right?  Yeah.  Why didn't they sign anyone else?  Oh, there's a video I was telling you about.  I saw earlier where they, now they're checking out the pressure cooker bomb.  Oh, the pressure cooker bomb.  That they set off in the desert.  It was like a pressure cooker. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And all the, they put plywood around it and shit.  Fuck.  Oh, some fucking, put some nuts and bolts in there.  It rips right through everything.  Yeah, someone was lazy, though.  They didn't go and get the ball bearings.  Yeah.  So they had a, it looks like they had to improvise.  Wow, you're some nuts.  I mean, if they're reenacting, you know, what happened in Boston, why would, you know,  why wouldn't you get the ball bearings?  Yeah.  Go all in.  Maybe they did have them, too.  That'll hurt.  No, they didn't.  And masonry nails are always very good, too. 
[02:01:30]  Wow.  Those things without...  Here, here, here, here.  Watch.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  It's a big fucking fireball.  And then they talk about the shockwaves on the ground.  You see the shockwaves coming toward the camera?  Oh, wow.  That is?  Yep.  So would that knock you over?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Damn.  Gregory Abbott, by the way, the guy's name was not Gregory Isaacs.  Shaking down.  Very good, Jimmy.  Thank you.  That was on Twitter.  Frank A.  I love when we pick out a Pergament song.  I do, too.  Who did that song? 
[02:02:00]  I pick you up.  Oh, that's one.  I remember that from...  That's what the other song reminded me of.  Benny, Benny, Benny Mardonis.  What?  Benny Mardonis.  Are you kidding?  I'm good.  Really?  This is where you're in my wheelhouse, motherfucker.  Wow.  Go with Benny Mardonis.  That's about a little old girl.  Is it?  Come on.  He looks like a creep.  Into the night.  Hit it.  Into the night.  Benny Mardonis.  Let's see. 
[02:02:30]  What year?  This is a long, long time ago.  Oh, God, yeah.  I don't remember this.  What year is this, Tim?  I don't know.  You're up.  Because the other song you were playing kind of reminded me of this in some reason.  She has a hat.  Puts it on her hand.  It's in this break, though.  It keeps the name.  This is a pedophile song.  Oh, is this one of the pedophiles?  Oh, yeah.  We did this break.  Listen to the words.  She's just 60 years old.  What's pedophile about that? 
[02:03:00]  Nothing.  I don't know.  They still...  They changed the words.  There's almost something, Steve Perry-ish, about his voice in the chorus.  Not so much here, but...  Yeah.  Don't know what love is yet.  It's from 1980.  But I want you to know, if I could fly, I'd pick you up and take you into the night and show you my love. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  The whole town is saying, leave her alone.  Oh, boy.  But he's like, fuck that.  Well...  I'm going to get some.  Well, when's her birthday, really?  Let's look into that.  And what state?  Yeah, what state is it?  What state is it?  When's her 17th coming up?  I mean, really.  Why villainize the guy here?  Why so?  Judgmental.  Yes.  He wrote a nice song.  It's crazy.  It is catchy. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  You can sing along with this one.  Exactly.  It's like having it on and watching it go apart.  Oh.  And I would wait to hear you...  Did this guy have another hit?  No.  That's it, huh?  This is...  No, this is the definition of one-hit wonder, I do believe.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, no.  I don't even think he came close.  I could be wrong, but...  That's it.  There's two other songs, but I don't think they were hits at all. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah?  I Want It All and Someone to Love.  Oh.  People are shocked about the Firefall guy.  Really?  Yeah, I think we're just downplaying what just happened.  People are like, are you fucking kidding me?  One guy wrote...  Oh, Joe Hoff, 23.  I know you on Twitter.  He writes, I would have guessed anything except he's my UPS guy.  UPS guy.  I would just have that ready to blast that song every time I open the door for him when  he's like, yeah, UPS, you open the door and just blast one of his songs. 
[02:05:00]  If he can't make it with two to three solid hits, the fuck are we doing?  Oh, my God.  And I mean we, meaning all of us.  Do you think he still has dreams about...  He probably does local karaoke or something, or he's just hanging around with a band.  Like, literally, he's asleep and he's in front of an arena of people.  Was he ever in front of an arena?  A lot of those guys that only had one hit never really performed live.  But back then, oh, really?  They didn't really perform live, the guys that just kind of had that one song.  They had like three, though, kind of. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, a band like them, they probably tore a little bit.  I think maybe opening for someone, they probably played at some pretty big venues.  State fairs.  That was on the radio.  Big state fair.  And then he wakes up and it's like, oh, I got my brown uniform is right there.  I got to just put on my brown uniform and fucking...  See, that's a guy...  Push it away.  Oh, he's a friend of mine.  Hi, Jerry.  How you doing?  He's a dear friend.  Hi, Jerry.  He's a dear friend.  Someone just walks in.  A friend of ours. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, I told Kenny.  I texted him.  He's like, what's up, Jerry?  Hey.  What's up, man?  All right.  You guys know Jerry, right?  You look familiar, Jerry.  I gave you the Doors album.  Oh, right.  That's right.  I really liked that.  It was the Doors album.  Everyone signed it except for...  Morrison.  Neil Diamond's writing song inspired by Marathon bombing.  What?  Neil Diamond is going to write a song inspired by the Marathon bombing.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I cannot wait to get my hands on that one.  Oh, no. 
[02:06:30]  Sell up my blue jeans.  He's going to work off.  Sorry.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  If he can address it, so can I.  Exactly.  Fuck him.  You know he's going to work off Sweet Caroline.  Sweet Boston Town.  Yeah, it's going to be something stupid.  Sweet Marathon.  What can he say that's going to sound like that?  Strong Boston Town.  Oh, we're sweet town of mine.  Right, right, right.  Right, right.  Right, right.  Right, right.  You can't let them get you down. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  Ugh.  You don't bring me crockpots.  Anymore.  What a smother fucking...  Justin Stangl is suggesting we get Firefall Guy.  He wants me to put him on my elevator show in a UPS uniform singing that.  That would be great.  But he's in D.C.  He ain't anywhere close.  People are losing it over the Firefall Guy.  You know how we talk about, like, you know, falling asleep at night and stuff, and you're 
[02:07:30]  so relieved when you wake up?  Yeah.  He's the opposite.  He's the opposite.  Because in his dreams, you've got to think, like you're saying, he's in front of massive  crowds singing the hits, and then wakes up and realizes, oh, fuck.  Come late for work again.  Oh, wait.  Wait.  Can we play the music, please?  E-Rock doesn't know.  Hold on a minute.  Sorry.  We were dealing with something.  Come on.  Come on.  Why is it the one time we need you? 
[02:08:00]  It's always...  E-Rock, what were you dealing with?  What were you dealing with?  Hotline rang.  We thought it was Paul Mooney, and it's not.  So who is it?  Well, who answers the hotline?  Sal, but we were trying to...  But Sal could be like, hello, who's this?  It's Paul Mooney.  Why are you dealing with this?  Why do you need two people behind the phone upside down?  He was talking into the ear part.  This is always happening.  We needed the...  There's only one time we really, really needed you.  So what happened?  Wait, wait.  Who was on the hotline?  It was somebody for Roland.  It had nothing to do with Paul Mooney.  So why did you have to be involved with that?  Why did Sal just field that call? 
[02:08:30]  Without you even being involved, and you're still staying by the board?  Because he asked me if I knew who it was, and I didn't know who it was.  I said, hold on, maybe that's Paul Mooney's guy, and we were trying to get Roland.  Can't Sal take a phone call?  Why can't Sal...  Sal didn't do anything wrong.  Who was on the phone?  Shut up.  Sal did do something wrong.  If he can't take a phone call, figure out who it is.  I know.  Iraq, there's a man on this magic device making sounds.  Fucking blithering idiots.  Just ask who it is.  Holy shit.  He didn't do anything.  That was the sentence.  Does Sal not know the protocol on the phone? 
[02:09:00]  Like, when you say hello, does he not think to say, who is this?  Iraq, how could you not think it's ridiculous that two people are needed to answer a phone?  It's ridiculous.  Do you know what we wanted?  No.  I'm going through it.  He was busy being the second man answering the phone.  Right.  The two-man operation of answering a phone.  Iraq just loves being involved.  Yeah, he does.  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  Involved a little bit here, a little bit there.  Because if it's Paul Mooney's guy, Iraq wants to make sure that Iraq is the guy that Paul's Mooney guy talks to. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  A phone could be answered.  The hotline rings.  Hello?  Who's this?  Oh, yeah, it's blah, blah, blah for Roland.  Oh, what is this pertaining to?  Yeah, it's this, that.  Okay, hold on.  I'll see if Roland's around.  I'm going to give V-Rock a chance, though.  You don't feel like Sal is competent enough to take care of that task, do you?  I thought he was.  He asked me who this guy was because we were expecting Paul Mooney.  And I said, I don't know. 
[02:10:00]  So couldn't you have said, is this pertaining to Paul Mooney, sir?  No, no, it's not.  It's, okay, all right.  How could Sal not field a fucking phone call?  Sal, comment?  And can you save your thing for a second?  Because now everyone is calling.  They know about other guys from bands.  Do you want to try this?  Sure.  All right.  Let's go to Tony in Cleveland.  Tony, go ahead.  It's a very difficult situation.  Get ready with the music, too.  You rock.  Go ahead, Tony. 
[02:10:30]  Okay, guys.  Have you ever heard of a little band called the Raspberries?  Yeah, go your own way, all right.  Go all, how does that?  That's Fleetwood Mac.  No, no.  Go.  Oh, fuck.  Raspberries.  Yeah, we know.  What's the name of the song with Go Away?  Go All The Way.  Go All The Way.  Thanks, Jerry.  Jerry's the king of music trivia.  Is he?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, Go All The Way by The Raspberries.  Give him a little tip.  Lead singer was. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  This is like K-Tel Records all the way.  What about him?  You hear that nasty riff?  Yeah, that nasty guitar riff.  He fucking made the song.  Right.  That was Wally.  He played at Double Neck.  He was like one of the second guys ever to have the Double Neck guitar.  Him and Paige.  Paige, well, he now is a supervisor at a little factory over adult retards that put together 
[02:11:30]  little parts.  Oh, my God.  There is.  All The Way.  Wait, so he works with handicapped adults?  That's nice.  So do we.  Yeah, apparently.  How do you know this?  Look, I answered the phone all by myself.  Yeah, of course you did.  Wait, I'm going to help you plan a bus trip.  I used to work there.  What?  That's how I know it.  I used to work there.  No, I was a supervisor. 
[02:12:00]  I wasn't under him.  Wally, were you fired for having sex with the people you were in charge of?  I was doodling one of the employees.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to move on to John in Philly.  John?  Hey, hey.  Hey, John.  Hey.  So my boss does a drain cleaning, and he tells me, he goes, hey, I did a drain for a guy  in Cinderella.  You know this band?  I'm like, of course I know this band.  So a few weeks later, he calls me.  He goes, hey, the guy's drains clouds, a different one. 
[02:12:30]  He goes, you want to go?  I'm like, yeah, I want to go.  So I'm all excited.  The dude opens the door.  He has like this big witch's hair.  Like he's still trying to play a rock and roller, but he's got like a water on his nose  and stuff.  So I try to talk to him about music.  Dude, he don't want to talk about music at all.  I go in his basement.  His basement is just full of old boxes of records that are all dusty.  And then the worst part about it, we get done to the job, he's like, man, I ain't got  no money.  He's a guy from Cinderella's broke. 
[02:13:00]  Which guy, though?  Which guy?  He's a keyboardist.  Oh, the keyboardist?  Yeah, he's a singer.  That's why he's broke.  Right on, brother.  Thank you.  And one more.  Frank in Brooklyn.  Frank.  Opie and Anthony and Lil Jimmy Norton.  What do you got?  Hey, remember the band The Lodge and Kicking?  Hold on a little tighter.  I don't know that one.  Do you have that, Iraq?  Hold on a second.  I'm looking for it.  Hang on.  What's it called?  Tighter, tighter.  Tighter, tighter.  Tighter, tighter.  Jerry.  Why wouldn't Jerry know?  Music expert. 
[02:13:30]  That's why he's here.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm a wedding band now.  He always blows a tooth.  I never know how to tell a story.  What's he doing now, sir?  We heard you.  Oh, I remember this one.  Nobody else before you.  At least he's still singing if he's in a wedding band.  Yeah, I remember this one.  Yeah.  Well, Brad Delp, you know, we've told the story many times, you know, from Boston, ended up 
[02:14:00]  in a Beatles cover band.  It was an elite singer.  Was this a Bee Gees ripoff?  Sounds a Bee Gees.  I'm going to say, what about this?  The drummer from Boston.  Oh, yeah, I know.  He wound up on a hit show.  Oh, God, yes.  It's Zibby.  The drummer's up.  The lead singer's doing better than the drummer.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  It's like the Bee Gees.  Absolutely.  Wow. 
[02:14:30]  Anyway, maybe E-Rock's got what we need now.  So, you know, a lot of us wake up from our good night's sleep thanking God that what we  were dreaming about, it wasn't true.  But not for the guy from Firefall who now works at UPS.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Hello, New York City.  Oh, my God.  I got to call the guys. 
[02:15:00]  When's rehearsal for tonight?  I think I got to rehearse a couple of times before the gig this weekend.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  I work for UPS.  No.  Oh, my God.  I got to put on a brown uniform and drive for 16 hours dropping off boxes to people.  Oh, my God.  I got a hit band.  Oh, my God.  I dropped your back and I was playing music.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  Maybe he owns it.  You think he owns it?  Oh, those stores are franchised, right?  Maybe he owns a little UPS store.  Yeah.  You know what?  Maybe he took his Firefall money and said, you know what?  This is what I'm going to do now.  Open up a little UPS store.  That would be okay.  Yeah.  A little business.  A little small business.  Wait.  Alive and Kicking was Jen and Buddy's wedding band?  Yeah.  Melinda's saying that?  They actually...  Wait.  The whole band is a wedding band?  Yeah.  That's what that guy was saying. 
[02:16:00]  Oh.  That's interesting.  And it's...  Yeah.  Melinda's sister and brother-in-law's.  Their wedding band was them.  Wow.  That's cool.  Damn.  Where do they get the money to hire Alive and Kicking?  Right?  That's a lot of money to get them for your wedding.  Fucking yeah.  Cough up them ducats, yo.  Some guap.  What's up, Jerry?  Cough up a lot of guap.  I want to know about Jerry.  Jerry?  What are you doing, Jerry?  Visiting New York. 
[02:16:30]  Visiting New York.  Now, Jerry.  What do you do, Jerry?  I think I've seen you in L.A. too, right?  Should I come up here?  Yeah.  I think I've seen you in L.A., no?  Uh, yeah.  I think you've showed up at some of our games out there.  Long time ago.  It was the X Games, I think.  Yeah, see?  I have a good fucking brain.  Oh, shit.  I do remember seeing Jerry.  Jerry gave me a Midnight Cowboy poster signed by Voight and Hoffman.  Holy fuck.  John Voight!  Really? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  He's the best photo collection.  It makes me sick to my stomach, the people he's met.  It hurts me.  What do you do?  Do you hang out and get pictures and stuff?  Autographs?  Yeah.  I pretty much got a picture with everybody, but...  Wow.  Jerry's a maniac.  Yeah.  Have you met John Voight?  I met him a lot of times.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Did you drive in his car?  No?  Driving his car?  Yeah.  John Voight's car.  John Voight!  John Voight!  Is this side note?  Of course it is.  Is your mic on? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, unfortunately.  I'm kidding.  I'm just kidding.  That's just fine with you.  I like Jerry.  Roy...  Jerry, what do you do in L.A.?  Roy...  Roy...  Roy Erikson's struggle with mental illness.  Who?  Rock revival.  What is that?  What?  I don't know.  It says...  Roy Erikson's struggle with mental illness.  It says Rokie.  R-O-K-Y.  Who's he, though?  Who is he?  I don't know.  Was he working on UPS?  I was thinking we were doing a music break.  We might as well.  Roy Dennis.  He started a band.  Roy Erikson's struggle with mental illness.  Roy Erikson's struggle with mental illness.  He pleaded insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, all right.  He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  Nice.  He was treated with Thorazine, electroshock therapy, and experimental medications.  Nice.  He described it a little bit to me.  What was his song?  Can you know this guy?  I didn't expect it.  I don't know.  He said, sometimes, you know, I hear something.  That's his son?  And it's ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran.  I don't know how to shut up.  What's kept him alive, he says, is his music.  That's him?  What music? 
[02:18:30]  Always bad shit crazy.  At least his hair looks fucking realistic.  Every day is still a battle.  Who is this?  I don't know.  His big song is Bite the Nurse's Face.  And they spell Rocky R-O-K-Y, by the way.  Oh, that's funny.  What was his song?  Oh, the fucking, um, yes, I remember his fucking song. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What was it?  Pet the Puppy to Death.  That was a really big one.  I'm going to pet my puppy to death.  It was like a country song.  You're so pretty, I could throw my shit at you.  That was another big one.  You know?  Jump Up and Down a Lot was a big one.  What was his big song?  Anyone?  I think it was Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock in My Feces. 
[02:19:30]  No, you know what?  That was the follow-up.  That was the B-side.  The big song was Run Outside of My Underpants.  Rocky Erickson.  Who is he?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean...  The fuck is this guy?  They blew off Boston Bomb coverage for this on CNN.  All right, let's see.  Who is he?  He's from a group called 13th Floor Elevators.  All right.  It's a psychedelic rock thing.  Do they have a song that we know?  Why do they even fucking deal with him?  Maybe there's a documentary. 
[02:20:00]  A lot of crazy people.  Why did they pick Rocky Erickson today?  Because of his documentary?  His documentary?  Yes.  They have a song called You're Gonna Miss Me from the...  It was in the 60s.  And this is him?  I like this sound.  Fuck it.  Let's go to break with this.  Just play it.  Fuck it.

[02:23:30]  you're doing so they told me who you are so i know who am i so i know who you are so just wait  until i catch up with you when i when i catch up with you then you'll find out how those see  you know the guys are back from the toilet and now back to our show 
[02:24:00]  all right all right we got yale sunning coming in uh tomorrow let's not forget  all right big fight with john jones right right around the corner at this point yeah i thought  john jones was coming in too maybe they just don't want to see each other now they came in uh together  yeah they did and they were getting along but now uh looks like john jones will not be coming in with 
[02:24:30]  chel sun and we were excited to have them both in again ah we could talk about ryan lochte with  learning that he could be the dumbest man alive yeah apparently from um the interviews he's been  doing for this new tv show some kind of reality show uh yeah he's a blithering idiot i hear uh  letterman had a good time with him i'm also hearing that aj clemente will be on letterman really yeah  that's why he's not doing our show oh is that right mr stangle stangle or stangle stangle 
[02:25:00]  isn't that right mr stangle do you see his brother made the news eric stangle eric always makes the  news with his tweets with nike you have the story in front of you there no what is it oh the boston  mayor lost a massacre shirts what does he have to do with that i know nike's uh pulling the shirts yeah  he found them in the stores and took a photo and then ap took it and ran to nike with it  what do you think about that i don't think you should be pulling shirts i know it's sensitive 
[02:25:30]  yeah you could understand why everyone gets sensitive and shit you can't goof on um or not  even though it's not a goof you can't even address things unless it's in this solemn  way when when stuff like this happens you can't joke about it you can't uh talk about it uh with  any kind of insensitivity you can't have a shirt that has any implication of it on it but i think 
[02:26:00]  it just takes care of itself i don't think people are running out to the nike store to get a boston  massacre shirt right now they're probably they don't want to buy it and i don't think they're  gonna like buy it and then run up to boston and like rub it in everyone's faces i think it just sort  of is it's its own little thing after a while somebody tweeted last night it was pretty good it was  like hey are we allowed to hate boston again like can we can we hate boston again now  it's taking so long well you got the nicks playing the celtics yeah in the playoffs is that  like uh game two tonight going on yeah there's a nice little rivalry there 
[02:26:30]  i'm taking a peek at the nicks well you know what mellow mellow is lighting it up there sam roberts  i know your pal uh mellow i know and i'm not a big fan of mellow but he's uh he's certainly getting the  job done lately yeah anybody as much as a ball hog and anybody that thinks well the celtics you know it's  got to be the way you know like storybook uh thing where boston goes through this tragedy and  the celtics got to go and take it all for the city and stuff it doesn't work that way you know 
[02:27:00]  remember the yankees after to fucking 9-11 right up three to two and they fucking got beat by those  cunting arizona diaries right remember that kurt schilling i'm glad i'm glad he's broke  fuck him fuck him well he did it to himself he's he's close to getting a ups job  fuck the firefall guy save kurt schilling a job  yeah i thought the next thing uh destroy the celtics oh yeah yeah this series yeah yeah i think so 
[02:27:30]  how can you tell basketball scores are usually so close it seems to me it could go either way at  any given moment at the end of the game when it like matters a lot of games go exactly that way  like it's amazing it's like all right there's the end of the game and uh you're within one or two  fucking points of each other right so it just matters like who gets the ball last how much time  is left for this guy to fucking heave it it doesn't seem like it's like you can even have a blowout 
[02:28:00]  for the most part and i think a lot of hockey games are based on complete luck so you think yes  they they they work their asses off to control the puck for maybe two seconds to try to get a shot  yeah it's a it's an exhausting game to watch yeah because they've gotten so quick and so strong that  they just they can't really set up any plays anymore they got to be instant instant playmaking like when  we were growing up you saw your team coming up the ice it was way slower and they could like set up 
[02:28:30]  some shit i like when they set up modern day hockey not not even close and you only really  you only really see that shit during a power play now right where there's a lot of fucking setting up  and and they'll they'll pass the puck around right trying to pick a spot but it used to be that way  with even sides right you know the team would be over there and they're fucking knocking the puck  back to the side over now it's like get this shot it's just exhausting just trying to control the puck 
[02:29:00]  uh we got paul mooney on the hotline oh mr mooney hey good morning welcome to the open anthony show  you haven't been around in a while sir well you know what goes around comes around i'm around now  so it's all good yeah it's all good there you go trying to figure out what happened at the comedy  club because uh what's coming out is kind of sketchy oh what's the sketchy this stuff what are they  saying well we want to we we want to know uh how it all went down because i guess you had 20 people 
[02:29:30]  leave the club they were saying you were being insensitive paul and all we know is you said white  people in boston deserved what they got and it was okay to lose a few limbs and as long as no blacks  got hurt it was okay oh that's not true see i knew they took that out of context yeah that's why we're  getting you on the phone because we we we're all assuming there had to be more to this oh it was  more to it it was a it was a inside job it was a setup it was the police with the oh oh you're thinking 
[02:30:00]  conspiracy no no no the police did it they did it they did it they did it before a long time ago  they had a uh like a hit out for me i mean not you know a mental hit not a not a physical one uh-huh  uh-huh yeah and because they're all a bunch of like they're into a cult uh it's got it's got a  a whole bunch of things they're into religion cults about it white power klu kuts clan i mean  they're into a whole bunch of stuff and it's a it a lot of them you know a couple of them work at 
[02:30:30]  the club you know they have those tattoos from jail on their neck you know that that white power and  that insanity i had this is what i said i thought about uh because for the opening act  actually made jokes about it before i did oh yeah and that was okay because it was like a setup  because a lot of the people that were there with a lot of blacks too uh were friends of his and all  of a sudden everybody was sensitive you know about it so it was they they were heckling me it's too soon 
[02:31:00]  to talk about it give it two give it three weeks you know because what i said was i said that uh  uh let me think of her name uh that old she's gone now the jewish lady that that uh a long time  ago when they used to blow up things in israel remember like uh at this late i think it all started  right in 1939 but she had said that israel was a school for the world golda meyer yeah she said it 
[02:31:30]  was for the world that there was a school that america and the un and everybody was phony and  everyone was it was all about money and uh that uh it was a school for to teach people how to blow up  things you know with this terrorist crap way before we knew 9 11 anything about it she said i want you  guys help she said you guys are not helping me i mean they also shot her and put her in jail everybody  forgets this because she was going around the world like alex james earl jones yeah yeah yeah 
[02:32:00]  kind of like yeah you're right so anyway she she said that that this was our future it was the world's  future because she's traveling around telling everybody she wanted uh them to help her she said  you think it's going to stay here she said uh germs spread they don't stay in one place you know it's  like if your body tells you you have cancer and you ignore it that eventually you're going to die  she said so this is our future this 9 11 everything else about terrorists he said if we don't stop it 
[02:32:30]  now it's going to spread like a disease yeah he said all this and i said all that way before i made  the joke about they they knew i gave them the buffer before i said what i said and i said that we were  getting what we i said myself too what we deserve because we didn't listen to her didn't help her  and i said her predictions came true but did you did you preface it by saying white people got what  they deserve no okay because that's what that's what people are saying that you said yeah all right  no i said we all of us you're saying almost like when when uh when when candy got shot and malcolm 
[02:33:00]  x said it was the chickens coming home to ruth talking about the violence you're saying that we  collectively kind of deserve what we get because we didn't cut it off we could have right because we  we didn't stop it listen you go for bad before it happens you don't go for bad after it happens  you know because america come come on before 9 11 did we go for bad no i really know after 9 11 we  went for bad okay now how did you go to the airport you know you go to the airport and they they pat 
[02:33:30]  you down they do all this stuff to you they should have been doing all that stuff before that happened  yeah oh yeah how did you paul how did they tell you that they were like did they let you know that  night hey we don't want you to come back tomorrow or how did that happen no no they all knew they all  knew no they did they did it the next day but i knew that night oh you did my crew and everybody  i was with and i called my manager and i said it and i also said it on the radio show because they  asked me about uh uh about negro domus they are i was on some radio show and they said uh let negro domus 
[02:34:00]  make some predictions and i said here are the predictions i said because with this this uh uh  incident happened with these bombers and all this stuff i said they're going to cancel one of my shows  i've known already i said if i even mention it i said it's going to get them all crazy so it's set up  they already know look first of all uh i'm not i mean who do you think they're coming to see i'm not  mickey rooney okay no i feel and i'm paul rooney and they know you know you you you get what you get 
[02:34:30]  i mean this listen i talk about it my whole thing is i talk about what's happening and i talk about it  and it wasn't like you know one little thing i said i said a bunch of stuff you know and i talked  about a bunch of stuff i talked about slavery i talked about the indians i talked about a lot of  people you know so were you surprised were people walking out were they friends of the opener the ones  that were walking out and objecting yeah yeah he yeah they came to see him oh yeah i already know it  uh-huh but he was out talking to them and there were people in the club who were also talking to 
[02:35:00]  them okay so you think that they just panicked you think the club was angry at you or that they  panicked and worried it was going to be bad repercussions a lot of a lot of email came in the police  the police came a lot of email came in too soon it was too sensitive you know but it was so it was a  setup and listen listen you always you can look i can't i've been around long enough to know you can  always tell when it's an inside job you can always tell i mean like uh uh you know when kennedy was 
[02:35:30]  was uh was assassinated inside job you can always tell when uh uh lady die was hit inside job inside  jobs it always is in your backyard it's always doo-doo and it really stinks because you because you do it  in your own backyard hmm so you feel that they wanted to get you out of there i feel no i think i  feel they wanted the controversy the police these police are they are stereotyped the ones that work  there these big overweight huge uh uh police officers you know yeah much of them are either married to 
[02:36:00]  those black women or they're taking care of them they're they're their mistresses you know it's just  it's just it's very weird it's very weird and see it's not one thing it's a combination of things  no let me when when they fire because there's always a weird thing with comedy because you had  to think a sold-out show so do they say like we're not paying you or we're going to pay you on the  sellout we just don't want the hassle oh no they can't they can't do that it's against the law because 
[02:36:30]  you can't worship two gods huh someone like where you work if someone has two things if you can get  in trouble for doing that you can't do that you can't control that with a bunch of things you can't  have two things at one like in the courtroom you can't do both i can't listen i can't fire you  because i think that uh i hired you to paint my house and you didn't paint it right and uh i said  well i'm going to take your money from the club i can't do that no so i'm saying the club did pay 
[02:37:00]  you for the show that they that you didn't do yeah oh yeah they paid yeah they paid okay it was it  was done already they had already made the contract right i did my job i showed up i performed right  you know i you don't have to show up but if i don't perform then they don't have to pay me  but i performed so the audience what the audit when they left the audience applauded the audience  the audience started helping the people that left hmm yeah i mean it's it is really weird like if you  go to see paul's show i mean you're not surprised that he's going to say things that you you may or may 
[02:37:30]  not find objectionable but that's kind of part of what you do and do you think people by this point would  know that you know who's your first year of doing comedy but you know after a long time people know  what your reputation is and if they that's what they want to hear that's what they go for a lot of  people thought they heard uh white people and you said that white people got what they deserved that  seems to be the biggest part of the controversy as a matter of fact is the fact that uh you know  race was brought into it well well here's the thing people hear what they want to hear it's selective 
[02:38:00]  hearing it's like when someone sees a head on collision everyone sees what they want to see  right i just have said that they see what they want to see you know and they hear what they want  to hear it's selective hearing so but that wasn't said at all no white people no i was talking about  white people but not about you think i want white people to be blown up and all that kind of stuff  i even said that the dog got blown up okay and i and i said that the dog lovers i said if they ever 
[02:38:30]  find those people i said they'll cook them and feed them to the dogs you know and so so i mean look look  jokes when you give a joke why does an audience like what why does someone laugh someone laughs if  there's a bit of truth to it okay they'll laugh even if they don't like it right that's what makes them  laugh you know something like i mean we could discuss laughter what we're really discussing here 
[02:39:00]  and you and i they're having us talking about race and we're talking about this just what they want  us to do talk about it to spread the word the whole thing with what we the bottom line is we're really  discussing freedom of speech that's what we're talking about well absolutely yeah yeah yeah and it's  it's an underlying to that and it's very scary and that's what they want to stop they don't care  about race or anything else that's what they want to stop because the comedians are the last gladiators  okay the arena we're the last one you know and what do they want us to do like that movie hide in 
[02:39:30]  a basement somewhere and have people come and sneak and listen to comedy right yeah i agree it's a a  freedom of speech issue but um you know people do people do get in trouble uh up on the stage we've  seen it before people like michael richards you know he got uh pretty much exiled from uh the  stage uh from what he said tracy got in trouble tosh there's a guy named joe coy a lot of guys are  getting flack but they even with michael they don't i don't know if you were there that night but they 
[02:40:00]  don't tell the whole truth about it they won't tell the whole truth they they tell what they want to  tell what did they leave out with michael because we just saw part of the tape i mean obviously i was not  there the audience was heckling him yeah and i i said it before and people they thought laughing  there was some there was some gangster gypsies there and i'm i mean they were real gangsters  the gypsies and they were a gang and and they were heckling him yeah yeah and it was one of the 
[02:40:30]  gypsies mother who was like she's a she's a stand-up and she's good and she really  was she gave him no mercy wait she's a comic and she was heckling him yeah she was an audience  she's the mother wow she's good and she's good she said look you ain't funny you ain't never been  funny and on that show uh they put everybody around you to make you look funny and your hair 
[02:41:00]  is weird and you're weird and get off the stage and every time i see you i throw up you know i mean  she was really cool and he just lost his fucking mind the show's off and on the show you were the  darling of the discontent and here you're not the darling so get off i want to hear some funny stuff  wow see that kind of makes me why would she heckle him from the audience though as a comic why would  a comic yell another comic with that yeah it's pretty stupid oh no listen first of all an audience  it's in total control my audience applauded and started heckling the people that left 
[02:41:30]  but the people that were there to see somebody else they just they kind of probably didn't know  what they were in for yeah yeah but they just thought they start cursing them out and telling  them to get out and go home and they would they would just and they started using my jokes they  started using my jokes to heckle them wow that's how that's how my audience knew me they started using  my jokes yeah i believe that it could get you know one or two people twitter something you know  because you talk about white people so you might have been saying something earlier and they just tie 
[02:42:00]  it in and say well that's what you're saying and i don't have a dumb audience can get it wrong this one  this one tweets get around like it is exactly what happened yeah that's not fair is there a tape  of your performance that you can prove that you didn't say that listen to you that i can prove it  isn't that funny no just a just a i'm not on no but not not not not just for your life paul i'm on  your side i'm just saying for your livelihood because obviously this is going around as fact 
[02:42:30]  so then you you push back by going well here you go motherfucker instead of just taking my word for it  i got a tape of what i actually said i'm on your side i believe you but unfortunately you know a lot  of people don't because they're just going with the one tweet that's out there but they don't care  same thing happened to me at the apollo when they threw me off the stage there same thing happened  they wanted me to prove that well prove it prove it and i had proof i had witnesses i had witnesses  they had a mock trial i had witnesses come up comics and people that were in the audience and they 
[02:43:00]  didn't believe them i had one time i believe what they want to believe well i had an incident i had a  heckler incident in the cellar that was bad and i brutalized a couple and i felt great brutalizing them  and the new york post was there and they were going to go to the story and uh it was so clear  the audience was completely on my side they cheered when the couple left but um i could have refuted  the story and posted the video but what happened was i said something far worse than the reporter 
[02:43:30]  picked up that probably would have given me a problem as the guy was walking out i said something  barbaric and i couldn't post it because i actually had a bigger mouth no kidding but i see how you can  have a moment like that and i couldn't believe that this reporter saw it the way she did when  everybody else saw it differently but so i could definitely see how that happens when somebody in  the crowd gets it wrong right all right i mean also also you could have people there that have 
[02:44:00]  have a hard-on for you and have a long time ago you may have said something to them you know yeah and  they can be they could be fair they they have it in for you listen first of all people love for you to  be up so they can cut you down that's a that's a part of it you know and the audience is really and  you know that they're like a pack of wolves they can't turn so so in the end you don't care if people  don't believe you that's fair enough yeah well it's not about that it's about what i do i mean  i'm a comedian the bottom line is i'm a comic no matter what i say i'm a comic okay that's the 
[02:44:30]  bottom line i've been there for a very long time so and and of course controversy all this stuff yeah  it's it's controversy but listen i'm not a terrorist okay i'm not a terrorist i'm not i'm not any of those  things that i don't i don't how do i how do i hate myself okay i i come from flavor i have white blood  other me i'm i come from louisiana i'm a geese black all white it's all the same what what i hate  myself right it's all stupid is there anything that happens like at times you know comics we do 
[02:45:00]  with the climate we're in right now is there ever times where you'll say things or have those moments  where you're like oh this is going to be bad um even though you don't you you still are comfortable  saying what you say do you ever have those moments where you're like fuck is this one going to give  me a bigger problem than i that i kind of was expecting well not really because i'm not caught  up in my own world i just get up and do what i do right okay all right i'm gonna do what i do i mean  i remember one time i went i did a show and it was all women it was all females okay those those women 
[02:45:30]  that uh you know that that uh men of sexes and this and that and women should rule you know that  wonder woman crap you know i went and and i said oh my god this is going to be to myself scary and i  said some things about uh women's rights and the women went crazy they stood and they applauded me  and said i was right i called i said a bunch of you are uncle women you talk all this stuff about  uh women being in charge and a bunch of you are like blacks being uncle toms you just kiss that that 
[02:46:00]  that uh that that man's butt do anything he wants to do you just to stay in for the money or whatever  i said it you know he's a sexist you know it you live with it you know what he's about but you just  go along with it because either for your kids or for money so and they stood up and they applauded you  know and so it's listen it doesn't happen sometimes an audience is all black there's no whites okay  and and they can be offended because they're americans and you you know you you're living in a place where 
[02:46:30]  people are and the color of their skin doesn't say what they're going to be about people think  oh they're black so they're for this they can't they can be black their skin could be black their  brain could be white or vice versa well it's like krs1 said something after 9 11 i think he had said  something about how uh he said that well you know the terrorists weren't targeting us meaning black  people he said they were targeting like white people in suits and he got a lot of shit from that i 
[02:47:00]  mean you know and it was not just from white people a lot of a lot of blacks were very angry  that he said that too well you know i'm saying people people get offended you know  look people come out of homes and what happens to them and and things that go wrong and and their  relatives and uh school or their teachers and people got a lot of things in their brains that  they don't even know you know and then they they subliminate with you know i mean we get i mean we get  we get brainwashed you know that yeah i mean they they they brainwash us to think and to react the 
[02:47:30]  way uh the people who are in charge of politically who are in charge of the country want us the way  they want us to think you know so it's crazy well thank you very much paul we're very happy we got  a chance to talk to you because you know i figured there was something else to it and then you know  people just get shit wrong all the time and they kind of they paraphrase how they want to paraphrase  but they they do that but it's it's wrong to do that to commerce you don't listen jay leno 
[02:48:00]  david letterman the things that they say on that tv and the writers put in their mouth they say things  that are so wild and they they say it to millions of people okay right millions of people they say it  to i mean i got what three other people in the room or four okay i mean the messages that just like  the message that they send out about this whole thing with this boy that that was here since he  was 12 and and his uncle and the this and the that and he's good looking he's this he's that i mean 
[02:48:30]  sending the wrong message out of those other nuts out there saying if i do something crazy be famous too  for two seconds yeah you know and nobody should get money off this crazy stuff that they're doing  a book deal a movie deal i want to talk all that it's all it's all crap you know yeah yeah people  that do you have people that blow up stuff and do this crazy stuff they shouldn't get all this 
[02:49:00]  attention it's crazy yeah somebody pointed that out it's like we know the bomber's name we're  talking about another incident but when you think about it like the guy in the wheelchair whose legs  got blown off we don't really know his name or anything about him or what he's as a citizen what he's  lost but we know everything about this hunk of garbage and what his motivation was like who gives  a fuck what his motivation was he's shit and saying he's good looking and he's this and he's that i mean  i'm going what what is this this is the news i said this is disgusting you know these new people should 
[02:49:30]  be ashamed of themselves they should critique these people what comes out of their mouth you know  they're on tv every every damn day they're on television well they've you know it's funny the comics  are the ones expecting to apologize or expected to apologize and the press never has to say they're  sorry for and they do things that keep the violence going by by printing the manifestos and showing the  pictures and and talking about the motivation and they never have to explain themselves and they never  have to apologize no and they and you you see their energy and they get up they get up the way the way 
[02:50:00]  they get up watch watch their best approve rerun them they just love they love this they love it yeah  right learning and i mean it's and we it's flooding we're underwater and i can't really talk now because  i'm underwater and i'm in new york and they just love it so uh are you in new york now no no i'm back  in california now and by the time i got here oh my god i mean i've gotten emails i mean you know the the 
[02:50:30]  world is out there that people when i got home when i got to the airport and then when i when i came home  on the plane you know i could tell from those people and the pilot the hate looks that they gave me  really oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it is a very controversial thing but you know at least you  get the word out there now that you know someone got it wrong as they normally do yeah and and you  know what and people like yourself and like your show and and your crew and the people uh and probably 
[02:51:00]  they have a double agent and they're with you working with you too double agent i'm sure there's  at least one we would have been fired years ago i don't know what other people i gave him enough  all right brother we'll see you soon okay paul all right paul all right thanks man thanks man  take care paul mooney everyone uh oh paul mooney it's it's just not surprising to me that somebody in  the audience you know what i mean like you say something like that and they just they object to 
[02:51:30]  the content they don't like you're talking about it and they get uh you know the twitter something  stupid yeah right uh by the way i thought it was very obvious but of course people on twitter once  again uh the whole nike uh boston matter uh uh massacre shirts yeah yeah i know i know they were made  for the yankee the yankees and red sox rivalry yeah yeah i thought everyone knew that yeah of  course they were they were done beforehand and they're uh yanking the shirts off the shelves for 
[02:52:00]  now yeah well i sold my netflix oh right during that phone call and there's a there's a go down a  little bit there's a black man discussing you know the problems of the black man and whatnot and i'm  just offing my fucking stocks like a white person and how did you do on them did it go up a little  bit before you sold or a little bit where were you at pretty much stayed where it was during the um 
[02:52:30]  during the aftermarket right but um i cleared  45  you said the number was going to be low i thought it was going to be about  45 grand 10 or 15 45 grand 45 large on netflix in one day crazy not even 24 hours you know it's  funny this is how psychotic yeah when you just asked ant because i didn't buy netflix so when you 
[02:53:00]  said up or down i just realized a part of me was rooting for down because i didn't buy it  you're thinking uh but i don't want to see ant lose money but it's just that but you never want  first human nature terrible i was actually working for him today i was rooting for you today i didn't  think it was 45 large i didn't think it was going up that much apparently they blew the estimates away  wow they uh netflix is doing very well they got that original programming that they're starting to do 
[02:53:30]  a lot of people are subscribing a lot of people just sick of their cable providers they stink  i fucking go through the channels on on my cable system and the movies are just like  you just keep going through them because there's nothing you want to watch or it's  shit you've seen already a thousand times the tv shows that are on suck and you don't have to  watch them when they're on you just dvr them or on demand them anyway so as far as watching 
[02:54:00]  television anymore i don't know anyone that does it it's up so you and you want to see a movie  that isn't available on your system you try netflix out you go there apparently they're  they're doing very well so uh they've figured that whole fucking so i heard that their earnings  were coming out this morning yesterday or yesterday after after the bell yesterday the earnings were  coming out so i was like you know what let me fucking dump some shit into this and see what  happens don't you wish it was that easy every day oh it would be great is that e-trade yeah 
[02:54:30]  earnings are great time like earning you gotta if you could really pay attention to how a company's  doing like it was it would have been very fucked up if netflix announced that they had missed the  the estimates and we're doing poorly like so right before earnings it's kind of a good thing to pop into  a company that you probably know is going to do very well you might not do that well that i didn't  think it was going to go up that much it went up from 170 dollars a share yesterday and and it's at 
[02:55:00]  215 dollars a share today that's one day and you can share this info with your pals i punched in probably  at two i guess two p.m how about a little heads up i know i i should do that next time i did the same  i did tweet it though i tweeted that i was getting into netflix before that before the market closed  i think i bought a bunch of it yeah mooney was uh mooney was kind of hard to uh he was follow 
[02:55:30]  someone has to say mind i don't know what he was saying at that time i do it was a conspiracy against  him or against the fucking bombing at first it sounded like he was saying that the boston bombing  was a conspiracy in the police but he was talking about a conspiracy within the club they were setting  him up to uh well it's a very difficult situation there's cops that work there and again i've never  been to levity live so i don't know that who's working i've been a lovely live a few times and  i've had nothing but uh a great experience there so it's a it's a it's a great comedy club it's too 
[02:56:00]  bad they decided to to uh fire mr mooney we all know i think you should be firing comics but we all  know how mooney is though it's like it's ridiculous to think that anything he says is this insensitive  thing it's who he is it's his comedy that's what he says if he even said you know white people got  what they did of course he's gonna say that he's paul mooney he's got a history of this isn't  something new yeah he says what he wants it's not fucking obama heading to the rose garden with a  podium and fucking saying it right it's fucking it's paul mooney it really that's how you know the 
[02:56:30]  comedy world is in trouble when paul mooney yeah is getting shit for what he says for what he said  fuck that it's paul mooney he's been doing it first of all for fucking i mean you know almost  50 years he's been gonna stand up he's 71 is he 71 he doesn't look 71 no wow he's had him in studio  black don't crack opie black don't crack and he gave you some insight on the michael richards  situation man he would we all heard that he was getting heckled and he just couldn't take it anymore 
[02:57:00]  so he decided to go for the the most brutal thing he could say but i didn't realize it was a comic just  completely just destroying destroying him from the audience that's annoying though the the gypsy  one of the gypsy guys mom is a comic and he was a big gang so i guess you know gang gang gang  what are you heckling another comedian for let me malone i don't know if we have time for the ryan  lochte uh thing ryan lochte now fucking apple announces earnings after the bell today yeah so now or is 
[02:57:30]  it today or is it tomorrow morning it's today so now what do you do do i take some of the  fucking take some of the fucking goodness from netflix and dump it into some fucking options on  nope apple but which way if apple misses the mark and dies i should buy some put options i'll tell  you why scoop it up you got a dinosaur to buy don't fuck with your money no i already bought my  dinosaur no you need i'm gonna get another one you need another one you need one that's staring

[02:58:30]  ride don't let it if i take all of it now yeah what are you fucking then i put it up into apple  because all i'm doing dude all i'm doing is betting one way or the other is it going to go up  is it going to go down red black odd even oh let it ride what the hell what are you doing buy some  apple oh those are cool that one's really cool it's a tyrannosaurus it doesn't look like it's  around i wonder if they really look like that without like we always think they're one color  yeah but i wonder if they were multicolored like that that thing is sick looking yeah it looks fake 
[02:59:00]  though yeah it's kind of cool looking it's definitely cool it's not one of the more realistic looking  ones you're right but do you think that they were like striped like that maybe they were  is yours mechanical no i wish why don't you get a mechanical one that would be cool with your 45 large  oh man fucking moving around in the yard wall is that more than a thousand dollars yeah i'm rich  i buy toys people don't know if you made the core people want to know if you made 12 days 
[02:59:30]  what did you make 12 oh oh yeah yeah i don't i'm people are asking i wasn't even thinking uh  about that 12 days i i don't i haven't been counting no you gave us the number yesterday  that's why i know so we're just adding one onto that i remember it was the thursday before  the poker game like a couple weeks ago yeah or almost two weeks ago so it's yeah no it's not it's

[03:12:00]  it's like appropriate it's not just you being like yeah i guess i'm not doing anything well  alan thicc jr and we call him alan thicc jr because his name is allen and that's the first thing i  thought of wait alan thicc jr that's alan thicc jr you're alan thicc jr that's your real name no his  name is just alan it's just alan i added the other two parts to it you got excited though didn't you  it's like oh my god i love his music it adds a little bit of show business i was thinking of  robin thicc yeah that's alan you know that's alan thicc's son yes which would make his a brother 
[03:12:30]  and alan thicc had music that's true team songs alan thicc did all the tvs he did you didn't know  that facts of life different strokes yeah well in pain alan thicc jr is uh he doesn't have any musical  talent he's just as stupid and so and that's not an insult you know that right no it's fact  i didn't know that okay well again not you know not a lot that you're clarifying that he's almost  tard you think so yeah okay a tart almost tard tard no he's like a tart yeah he's kind of he's a bit 
[03:13:00]  of a tart um you see the peanuts in front of him what is with the costco jar of nuts in front of you  he found it he found it in our garbage box in the office uh this morning and he was like nobody can  eat these peanuts because his thing is he comes in every show he walks in after the show and he  looks at whatever whatever fruit jim is left behind whether it be grapes or banana or whatever it is he 
[03:13:30]  goes nobody's gonna eat these grapes nobody's gonna eat this banana and he just he just rummages through  do your parents feed you yeah they feed me they do yeah i mean i haven't seen them in a couple months  but no you must be hungry i'm very hungry yeah so he finds he finds the peanuts in the garbage  and he says nobody's gonna eat these peanuts and we go no and he goes why not and then sal  actually did something right for a change what are you talking about and uh he points out why don't you  show let me see is the label on there it's right in the front right underneath yeah why don't you 
[03:14:00]  show that to jesse may and jesse may peluso you tell me why you wouldn't eat oh because the last  time these refreshes when new kids in the block was on the radio waves what does that say 96 are you  kidding me those peanuts are marked 1996 right i hadn't even bled yet right come on that was  have you eaten some elm thick jr yeah that was full earlier this was fully full earlier today 
[03:14:30]  no he's in here just munching on him he's a quarter of the way through the container these don't even  look right they're not even like colors like well you know what the thing is they made them  differently in 96 we don't remember it because it was nearly 20 years ago they smell like 1996 yeah  i don't think what year were you born 1992 you were in 92 92 so you were how old when these peanuts  were made four yeah uh no uh two yeah four years old four years okay yeah you carry the three and then 
[03:15:00]  you don't get there there were 94 for some reason right yeah no even though we just said 96 i remember  i have all bad short-term memory yeah yeah no and long-term i'm shocked yeah i mean like do you  remember when you were four a little bit like do you remember did you remember making a sandwich or  anything uh eggs okay all right that's an egg sandwich imagine sure next good imagine if your mom  made you a plate of eggs right right and then you put it in the fridge yeah would you go home and eat 
[03:15:30]  that plate of eggs today would you even consider that as a possibility it's not dry food at that  point it's a this is dry food this is this is this is all right i mean i've been eating it i mean they  taste a little stale a little stale like a little stale well okay i think the biggest problem in having  is that i've been having to like eat them with water or like some of the drink because that's the thing with  food it's like it's sometimes you get these foods that need to be put with a beverage and it's like  oh oh god the stresses of life i don't know it might be like the old salt or something but it's 
[03:16:00]  actually like forming like a glue inside my mouth when i eat it right so it's actually like caking the  bottom of my tongue and it's making it hard for me to speak almost like when you put peanut butter  inside a dog's mouth you want to make out it's so hot so uh yeah so i've been having to wash it down  uh since i started eating them because it's actually forming peanut butter on the roof of your mouth  uh at the bottom of my tongue actually prove it to me i don't believe you're eating those  oh did you mention where he got them from in the garbage box correct it's a garbage box 
[03:16:30]  they expired in 96. doesn't that mean they had it like they were probably made in 94. they were made  when he was born because nuts last a long time not this long though come on you pansy but this is  you're like defying how long things should last yeah i mean i didn't even think the container would last  that long alan's gonna be late tomorrow we're all gonna get cancer from this box of nuts yeah it  just shouldn't even be out in the open yeah the garbage box i was corrected because i said yeah  you found those in the garbage can and alan goes i didn't find the garbage can i go well where did 
[03:17:00]  you find them and he goes i found them in the box where you know there's like uh a couple bottles of  something and it goes the box where we put the garbage yeah okay garbage box then not the garbage  can so it's like is this like a where they leave food like i don't understand no college dorm here  it's a box and then they're garbage inside that box and then somebody comes and takes the box and  puts it in a dump yeah they're doing it to clean out offices for the spring time it was in the giant 
[03:17:30]  garbage the giant one so it didn't even come from our office yeah no it's it's a big box that's in  the center of the hallway so offices can throw their garbage out it probably leads was that sealed  no oh my god what i need to call your parents what else was in the box that you were like i'm gonna  grab his jar nuts and i saw some uh raisins but the they were open so oh oh okay you got standards  that's ridiculous yeah that's insane this guy's got standards um all right so you go because what 
[03:18:00]  they're doing for spring cleaning here is like every three or four offices down the hallway they put out  a giant like probably seven foot by three foot and then four foot tall box to just throw the  shit that's in your office that you want to get rid of that's where you got those yeah you like  dove into this thing i didn't dive in i just kind of climbed in i casually saw oh i have long arms  but you really had to lean over yeah a little bit why were you looking in the garbage box you know 
[03:18:30]  early in the morning i was by myself um yeah that doesn't explain that doesn't bragging to me like  hey dude why would someone throw out this well yeah i mean why would someone throw out this perfectly good  i know can i guess i know i jesse may know you guys i was going to say because paula abdul made  them she actually made those nuts yeah it was between it was between her her hit records and american  idol and she was a nut maker a nut maker yeah two steps forward and one nasty jar nuts back yeah you 
[03:19:00]  should call dr steve see what's gonna happen to them yeah dr steve if you're listening call up and tell  me if you can eat nuts from 1996 that are not sealed it wasn't even sealed it wasn't even sealed  so you don't even know whose office it came from no someone's nuts could have been rubbed all over  those nuts true it could have literally then like i wouldn't even take nuts that were made this year  because i don't know whose hands have been all over them you know what i mean because somebody  obviously if it's not sealed somebody was grabbing out you know little handfuls and stuff so you don't 
[03:19:30]  need bar notes no no well it depends on how many tequilas i've had that's be pretty serious  then because seriously he's this in 96 you understand you're eating that's pre a bucket of  nuts right that didn't exist that existed before the company did can i tell you something so those  be bbs nuts yes before serious nuts yes before the technology known as satellite radio was created  right those nuts were so wait wait here the better question is who brought in the fucking nuts 
[03:20:00]  i don't know we're blaming this you know oliver twist over here he's starving who brought in the  the the fucking nut whoever brought him in they brought him in right in the middle of the grunge era  and just left them here who was the tenant in this building before serious xm i think we need to  find the the origin of these nuts we can't blame yeti over here because he was starving he's obviously  hungry he's wearing a lot of tans people who wear a lot of tan colored clothing tend to be hungrier 
[03:20:30]  than others people who wear earth tones earth tones tend to be a little bit more hungry is that  right alan i'm it's a fact yeah that's absolutely a fact yeah yeah yeah well uh do you have any money  is that the problem you don't have cash you can't just go out and buy yourself a little uh an orange  on vitamin time vitamin c nothing's open at 5 30. yeah but if you wait till six it's open nah and by  the way you know what the thing is it's actually new york and there actually are places open at 5 30.  well the other thing is i don't like seeing food go to waste right um that's not already been 
[03:21:00]  wasted away yeah that's actually not food anymore that's toxic avenger juice yeah if it's been in  existence for that long let me go to 412 uh what's up you're on after open anthony live hey sam yeah  i just wanted to give the seinfeld uh analogy if it's below the rim it's garbage if it's above the rim  it's not garbage so basically he just ate garbage a hundred don't quit calling them nuts because not 
[03:21:30]  oh yeah it's not nuts it's trash it's waste because not only was it below the rim but it was like you  had to lean over like four feet deep to get those nuts yeah but i mean like look they're not dirty  i look i smelled them you know i i inspected them a little bit i mean yeah they taste a little like  you had to bend down to get those nuts so far that you could have actually licked someone's nuts you  were bent all the way over those nuts were probably donnie walberg who was the dude in  it's called intestinal fortitude is that what it's called yeah that's what's going to waste right 
[03:22:00]  now that's what those nuts are just acidically eating up right now your intestinal fortitude  is anyone doing a nut count how many times you say nuts like goodfellas how they say  fuck you need to be on the count um eric you got some info from dr steve yeah he was in a meeting  but he uh he gave me a meeting about what nuts oh good timing or dead people and he told me that  you don't have to worry about about bacteria from uh dried foods like this because it doesn't collect  but you do have to worry about fungus oh that's worse than bacteria and he said even though it wasn't 
[03:22:30]  if the jar wasn't sealed it's a uh greater chance that you know fungus is uh is um coming together  inside of them oh gross the salt works like a preservative on it but inside of it it's not  preserved so inside there might be oh fungus and break a nut in half let's see if there's any fungus  in there any fungus oh you're nervous your hands are shaking would it be green or black or like it 
[03:23:00]  could be anything i mean i don't know i mean it looks it looks fairly uh fairly clean give me the  thing of nuts i'm actually going to touch one i think touch it sam i dare you to eat a nut no come  on do you have health insurance oh my god they don't smell right you did you smell them smells  like a costco toilet it's it smells like ammonia dude it smells like rolling have you smelled these  you're a foodie come here and smell them it smells like a pure one imports this it smells like the  the bin at like a daycare center where all the toys are yeah this smells like ammonia get it out 
[03:23:30]  get all the juices out there you go uh that's not what does it smell like it does like ammonia give  it to sal have you smell have you smell it smells like shit should i should i go to a doctor yeah  yep no shit for your fucking mental health okay geez let me see he's a mimbo i don't see any yeah i  don't see any fungus on these nuts but they do some the nuts them smell themselves smell like ammonia  i love how this wasn't a bit there wasn't a payoff he just did this to make himself sick yeah eric smell  the nuts you know what you guys should do bring the nuts i'll bring the nuts into air she makes 
[03:24:00]  you smell she's had tons of them before i know usually a little bit smaller than this yeah do  those smell like what hispanic nuts or these smell like pinocchio nuts because that's when they were  made before the wooden child was made let's go to john in wyoming what's up john yeah at this point  that's not even food it's fertilizer yeah i mean that stuff belongs in a compost heap  like that was a this was a terrible idea that you did eric you smelled it yeah it smells like wood 
[03:24:30]  cleaner yeah it doesn't smell like like you polish a deck or the living room floor with this stuff it  doesn't smell like food hi have you missed me are you flirting with eric i mean did you see how like  lackluster his response was oh is that the thing like he kind of he kind of gives you he puts you on  the pay no mind list and all of a sudden you're like oh my god who is this guy that walked in the  room who's this nut smeller not paying attention to me um fart knocker fart knocker i love that 
[03:25:00]  come on fart knocker i figured it was just because the nuts were from 96 that's where we're using our  slang from yeah let's all talk from 96 uh michael in new jersey we have cum sucker here i don't know  that i think that's timeless cum sucker no it's definitely a classic what's up michael what's the  company are they still in business stewards soon after making them no the company that sold it is stew  leonard's which is a like a wine distributor all right well i mean stew leonard's is in business  but i don't know if they make peanuts anymore they're gonna die you are you're probably gonna 
[03:25:30]  die on should we should we bury him in a sack of nuts yeah yeah we're actually we're just gonna  throw your body into one of those uh garbage boxes there's enough room somebody's gonna be like  i don't want to see this yeti sweatshirt go to waste you don't mind if they peel it off your carcass  do you it's a really nice sweatshirt yeah does it keep you warm comfortable yeah dude it's it's  super warm i yeah yeah i wear it uh all through the winter is his face on the back because it's  backwards it's just it's just this oh yeah he doesn't have a face it's just it's just weird 
[03:26:00]  amorphous you're a good guy i can tell he's a good guy no well i found it he's a himbo  i found it you know like he's like a little oblivious like of course he's a good guy he doesn't  know the evils like he's not he can't be a conniving evil dude because he's not there are you from  vermont no i'm from uh west texas okay yeah all right i knew that's where that accent was from  he's cute though yeah well you know what happened last time somebody said that jesse may they they  you met nicole from the morning mashup right yeah she came in and she was like i would bang him 
[03:26:30]  and we were like oh that's so funny ha ha ha a couple months later we find out that alan did not do  well in high school with girls like no girls and and the girl that he just broke up with that he's  still kind of banging on the side was the girl that was that was his first and so you know he's  just kind of getting into himself he's almost amish but he got so excited when nicole said she would do 
[03:27:00]  him that he went home and jerked off to it and so i would i could only imagine that he's now gonna go  home and jerk off to you are you gonna do you think you don't have to look look at me do do you  orgasm nuts from the 90s it smells like a moment from the 90s um do you think you might jerk off to  jesse may later if she doesn't want me to do it i won't do it but i want him to do it come on i'm  like gonna be 80 soon you got to do it while i'm young yeah it's complimentary we do that hey for  you for your for your for your sake and for my sake yes oh please yeah do it for my sake do it do a 
[03:27:30]  sympathy jerk take a picture  mental image man do you want to put up mouthful notes i'll put in my spank bank uh is your name  true in san diego yeah true in san diego what's up buddy hey um i just wanted to uh tell your intern  that um he's probably going to be fine eating those nuts the human stomach could probably digest  a lot of uh if it doesn't didn't have any kind of uh green or kind of oh no there's green there's 
[03:28:00]  green and black and red there isn't there i saw a black one it looked like a little like rat turd in  there you probably sucked it down already it looks a little like mix turn it turn it show so sam turn  on like the hue of this it looks a little like mixed nuts even though it's just peanuts like it should  all be the same color there's definitely a cashew or two in there there's some darkness there there's  like black because a lot of peanuts turn uh black and moldy when they're when they're too  there's a black one in there for sure no no no that's that's dark brown uh don't be racist 
[03:28:30]  that one it's not the color it's supposed to be down the hatch down the hatch buddy let me see  hold on that's a that's a moldy this one's this one's a bit too toasty all right that's a moldy nut  yeah that's kind of gross i mean this one and the fact of the matter is that they all smell like  ammonia no peanut is supposed to smell like peanuts are supposed to smell like peanuts  yeah it's supposed to smell like kind of like uh nutty yeah not like chemically not like mr clean  products no that's like that smells like it should be under a counter right locked in a box with a 
[03:29:00]  with a child lock on it and like a red triangle on the side like heisenberg would use it for his like  meth that's exactly right heisenberg would use that shit they'd be like what we need is the secret  ingredient that makes it blue we use peanuts from 1996 we use leonard stewart's peanuts yeah who's the guy  all right let's call this guy up and ask him leonard hey leonard how good are your nuts bet how you  doing how long your nuts last that's what happens that the chemical that comes off of these peanuts 
[03:29:30]  why would you eat something that's that old he was wearing earth tones sam he must have been hungry  he must have been starving um mogo the trucker he wants to get this one out uh you realize that that  alan sick jr and justin bieber both have 19 year old nuts there it is  there it is that's a good one all right buddy 21 but uh girls still go crazy over him no he just said 
[03:30:00]  did you hear what alan said he said no i'm 21 he was talking about the peanuts he's talking about  justin bieber's testicles oh my god i want to take him home oh shit i didn't recognize that you little  darling i want to take him home you do you want to just look after him don't you give him some  color he obviously he's wearing earth tones he's eating food from 96 out of bins from the hallway he  doesn't understand jokes he just needs to be taken care of he's a mimbo a little bit of a mimbo  i ain't trying to hear that um tom on long island 
[03:30:30]  all right there's one from tom  did you hear that eric hey what happened earlier today how come uh we never got to the bottom of  jesse may you missed it earlier today opie and anthony called on e-rock for a music cue  and he was nowhere to be found because sal needed help answering the phone  and the question arose why on earth would you need two people to answer a phone and we never got 
[03:31:00]  the bottom of it that doesn't make any sense no it's such an easy thing to do eric sal uh answered  the hotline gave me the name of the guy that was on the on the line there and he said i don't know who  this is but why didn't you ask him i don't know but i thought it might have been paul mooney's manager  so i said all right let's get rolling and then that's when they asked why don't you play that song  why don't you just ask the guy on the phone who are you i did but eric she said you didn't know who he  was i didn't because no one told me that he was calling usually when someone calls the hotline 
[03:31:30]  we we have a message like hey this guy's calling in at this time i had no message whatsoever  sometimes they call surprises i guess true i mean it's a phone you never know who's gonna call  right and they call looking for roland like yeah the guy said can i speak to roland i said okay hold  on a second but i didn't want to put him on hold and then you know something accidentally get put  through on the air or something like that so i just turned out i said hey what is this and then in  in that moment that was when all that happened no because because there was like minutes of  build-up that eric missed i that's not my i have no idea there's no way you didn't because the 
[03:32:00]  situation that you just described is two seconds right that's exactly what happened no it was longer  than two seconds but it wasn't that complex either like it wasn't long and drawn out you missed a  45 seconds yeah no i heard him started to go into who is it who's there who's there they went back  and forth right right and they started setting up and everything and then you went back and you  yelled at roland yeah i want to know what was what's the deal because when someone calls the  phone i said what's going on the fuck up you did that just like how i wasn't briefed on the paul 
[03:32:30]  mooney call what do you mean brief what's brief i want to know what time are you i said i said paul paul's  in call when he's in call did you get any confirmation that he was calling in if manager said i'm  gonna give him a message and nobody will know what if he'll call it or not so but why you need to be  brief why can't you just be like oh paul mooney's on i'll just put it up because sometimes you you  can't just assume that someone on the phone is actually who they are even if they call a hotline  yes because sometimes people do call the hotline accidentally anyone can attest to this yeah but 
[03:33:00]  what's the thing is you don't want to give out say hey this is the on a show hotline number you go  hello and who's this i do but then you don't know what is somebody just gonna like be a prank and  be like this is paul mooney and he happens to have the hotline thank you but then how do you get the  hotline have you ever been pranked on the hotline i have been i have had not pranked but people say  not prank what is the wrong number but the wrong okay okay but nobody's ever called up and been  like this is paul mooney on the hotline i'm gonna do it hey and then you say who is this and then they  say whatever paul mooney well you know that's the other thing too sometimes people don't sound like 
[03:33:30]  once they're on air they sound very different than when you but nobody like people call the number  incorrectly but you find that out as soon as you say who's this right that's why i don't say oh  and a when i answer the hotline you just say hello of course of course but with that said  you still don't need to be brief because you get all the information within 10 seconds of the phone  call it that that's that's something i didn't have that's information i didn't have and at the time if  i had the information none of that would have happened it's so complicated i want to get back to 
[03:34:00]  the nuts because i started getting yelled at oh sal can't answer the phone i answered the phone just  fine i did it normally like i always do it sounds like it's very complicated when you answer the phone  it's not he looks like this guy used to make out with like 10 years ago i'm sorry to hear that  close to the birth of those nuts yeah yeah still the nuts are still old that like the nuts at 10 years  ago still like still too old to eat inedible nuts 10 years ago what do you do alan thick uh i go to  college so i'm uh i work at other radio stations and uh you know communications major uh minor i'm a 
[03:34:30]  marketing major oh boy he's smart he's not smart at all he hasn't finished college sam there's no  way what happened to sal get the fuck out of here how come sal left eric there's no way that sal  answered the phone like he's i answered the phone just fine all you do is you pick up the phone you  go oh there's a hotline okay all right good anthony holy shit i am i'm driving a thousand miles an hour  ready to crash into a wall with the fucking south what the fuck is he talking about dude he's 
[03:35:00]  making answering a phone call sound like the most complex unbelievable job that there is that a  man could possibly do he's like here's his description the phone ring accepting a phone call  the phone rang i picked it up someone said hello and after hello you decided you needed help yeah you  needed help after hello well you have to understand anthony i wasn't briefed on this phone conversation 
[03:35:30]  breathe breathe breathe you ask who is this what are you calling about you feel the call yourself  you're on the phone you don't need to take eric off the board to help you with the simple  fucking thing that shadow does at home answers the phone you go hey who's this and they go oh this is uh  so and so oh so and so what can i help you with i don't know what to do after this point because 
[03:36:00]  guess what if it's paul mooney's manager somehow then at that point when you go oh what can i help  you with he'd say this is paul mooney's manager i have paul here and then the one person who answered  the phone can go look i have paul on the phone i did it myself the briefing word is what got me it was  like very like you know presidential he wasn't briefed he wasn't briefed he gave up on the just  consider this he gave up on trying to field the call solo after hello 
[03:36:30]  at that point he was out of office  to continue the call without assistance from another person oh my god hello through him off  this and then holy he's sitting there going i need to be briefed because i never know when it's  going to be a prank call there's never been a prank call ever in the war room but how hard would it be  to handle i mean what what do you need to do with it are there like look exactly what does he need other 
[03:37:00]  buttons that need to be pushed i mean no nothing nothing different than what a child is told by his  parents if the phone rings and an adult isn't in the room a child i want to see him answer the door  how does he how does how does sal answer the door oh my god he probably just hides under the house  yeah yeah because what happened because sal hears the door somebody knocking on the door and at that 
[03:37:30]  point he's like what i mean that's my job he's looking through his notes hold on hold on no one  briefed me about a visit i've been briefed briefed i'm just so listening to this it was driving me  batty not to be able to jump in and say what the is he talking about he's taking a phone call and you  know what was amazing it was amazing is there's an intern sitting at the phones right now and anthony you  called the hotline and i saw the hotline ringing i watched the e-rock the entire time not once did 
[03:38:00]  the intern go well i don't know some guy says he's anthony on the phone i don't know what to do  i know uh god it's fucking he is astounding sal just how difficult he's not answering the phone  you just walked back in sal's back in the room now oh god you're ponderous  south ponderous you can't even feel a call by yourself and then he tries to make it sound like  it's a shuttle launch 
[03:38:30]  shuttle launch you said ponderous enough for you all right have fun kids all right i'll talk to you  later buddy bye bye you understand it's not complicated the guy has to speak to roland though  why is someone calling the hotline asking to speak to roland why didn't you ask him i said what are you  calling about and he told me the thing that was going on what was going on yeah he had something  any secrets no good what was going on it was something about uh debbie our yankee woman okay 
[03:39:00]  right she's having the woman exactly the woman from the yankees that opie always brings up on the  air right she's having like she said okay can i speak can i speak to roland i said hold on one  second so i i put i put her on put him on hold and i guess in that moment i said to eric hey can we  get roland or whatever and that was the moment that all happened well why would first of all no because  you went back and started yelling at roland because after because you weren't briefed and  second of all why didn't you just text roland and be like i did i called roland immediately  roland was in the bathroom though but then why did you talk to eric about it i still don't understand 
[03:39:30]  why i spoke to eric before i called but i was calling roland on one phone i have i've hit the  guy on hold on one phone and i have the other i have calling roland on the other phone it's so  difficult that one isn't it no no it shouldn't be it really isn't it shouldn't be do you uh do you  you think he'd be a good candidate for the asshole of the week i'll i'll get to that don't try to  squeeze your bullshit he's trying to squeeze his bullshit and we got time i'll get to it but 
[03:40:00]  you two together on halloween would be scary like with the old candy and answering doors don't  very hard combination they gave me this apple there's a razor blade sticking out but it's still  an apple it's a good apple it's old and wrinkly but i'll eat it sounds like whatever as long as  i don't have to go to the door it's fine we just take whatever just get me one too chucking candy  from the roof don't but eric was distracted for like 45 seconds i did not distract i did not even  power 45 seconds there's no way that what happened was sal picked up the phone and he looked at you 
[03:40:30]  and said hey can we get roland and you just said yeah we can get him and then turned around and you  had missed 45 seconds of show it couldn't have possibly this interaction that long this interaction  couldn't have been as fast as one i don't think it was that long but two you're right it wasn't  you know it wasn't like that was sal panicky in there uh no he was more annoyed by what he wasn't  panicking he was just because he tells me this guy's name right and i go i don't know and i go oh  maybe it's paul mooney's manager calling i know roland was trying to get in touch with him let's get 
[03:41:00]  rolling they asked for me i turned around and i said i missed what we were doing okay i'm here so  that's a whole long interaction like let's pulling eric away from the show for for the uh  whatever interval of time but if somebody calls the hotline and goes uh i need to talk to roland  just text roland and be like okay i called him immediately sam no you didn't you said you  talked to eric first i did but that how okay i'll take 10 seconds as as as that happened did you call  i called roland on with one did you call roland immediately or did you talk to eric and i said 
[03:41:30]  to eric eric someone's on the hotline looking for roland that's exactly what happened dude so he  he told me the person i text the person and they're like oh what's up so they then they told  me what and then why did sal get mad at you because i didn't tell him i didn't know who's  calling that it was it was that because he wasn't briefed and the fact that when we were  trying to explain it on the air they all turned on sal right and that really it immediately became  my fault because eric wasn't listening dude they yelled at me he said fuck dude fuck dude  what i mean you didn't need to get eric's attention on that i whenever someone calls the hotline 
[03:42:00]  i always inform eric so that eric can either relay the message to opie or anthony earlier there was  no message there was the message to get in touch with roland i was hoping that maybe he had some  other information that i didn't know roland's not wearing headphones so it's not going to be able  to get in touch with roland for you no fucking personal calls on the hotline because i thought  it was a personal call what sal's making the rules for the hotline you can't even answer it no  because i thought it's the guy said i speak to roland about blah blah i was like okay this is  not related to the show i don't know no one told me that is because no one told me that though but 
[03:42:30]  you're so you're informing the the material for today is that what you're saying yeah i mean it's  become hasn't it so you're telling roland he's not to receive personal calls on that line here that  way yes initially and then roland explained to me afterwards what was going on but if roland said  i'm going to start using the hotline for personal calls it's on the air he could really but he could  just do that couldn't he yeah but i mean it's not like you could actually say roland no personal calls  because he'd be like or what i thought it was a personal call but even if it was it could be 
[03:43:00]  who cares roland's allowed that that's why i called roland just in the event that it was a personal  call i wasn't going to answer the call that's why i've informed you can't reprimand roland and say  no personal calls on the hotline i thought it was i'm not asking if you thought away even if it was  you can't be like hey you roll it no more personal calls exactly and that's what happens that's the  correct response and that's what happened there we go oh my god so did anyone talk to paul mooney  yeah he called in later it was fine but that's that paul mooney calls unrelated to 
[03:43:30]  and then you were upset when paul mooney called in later because you weren't informed that he was  going to you weren't you weren't able yeah you weren't briefed i wasn't upset i answered the call  and i put him on hold that was done no no no he gets off you said you you said a minute ago that  you were not brief you were upset that you weren't brief i didn't say i wasn't upset i said i wasn't  told no you said you were upset that you weren't briefed okay i was upset then that you said you  were annoyed that you weren't briefed i wish i i in retrospect i wish that roland would have given  me more information that someone was calling in online is there a preparation process that you go 
[03:44:00]  through before you answer the phone there's a guest i if there's a phone or i create a one  everybody that they're gonna i go they might or might not call in i have no idea yeah i mean we  did we were briefed yeah we knew that but nobody knew because the manager didn't know so you were  all schedule you were annoyed that you didn't know what time he was calling in or at all yeah  so is there like a a a process that you have to go through like minutes before you know the phone's  gonna ring no well it's like you start breathing you kind of like make sure there's no sweat on your  brow if someone's calling in if someone's calling in nine me mama mama make sure now brown cow right 
[03:44:30]  make sure the professional voice is on because you never know of course i can't even i can't get a  word what i'm saying is if someone's calling in and you never know and you never know who it is  you never know why don't you just stay there the whole show i do oh we got to call in the hotline  hello i want to hug some i'm i'm swear to god i'm gonna fucking drive  ponderous ponderous fucking sal is still arguing the point yeah i'm not trying to argue no no self 
[03:45:00]  here's here's the bottom is bottom line you're on the phone you feel the call no matter who  calls for who what where you never ever need to get another person if you don't know who is on  there and what they're supposed to be on there for you find out yourself because eric is working the  board why would you bother the guy working the board for the show for something that you're supposed  to be doing on the phone alone completely and how do you think you need roland and eric to field phone 
[03:45:30]  call it's a great question i i always tell if there's a hotline call i always tell eric that  someone's on the hotline if the hotline call it makes sense i understand what you're saying because  you're saying if somebody is on the hotline i tell eric so eric can tell opie anthony and jim in their  headphones correct if you have somebody on the hotline who you don't know who they are apparently  it's a personal call for roland why on god's green earth would eric tell that to opie anthony or jim 
[03:46:00]  in their headphones i i intended to ask eric if he knew any information about this as i was calling  no see that's where you're you'll find out the information you'll find it out you're on the  phone with the guy you don't have to tell eric there's someone on the phone but i don't know who  he is yet you'll find out if it's something to know for the show then you tell eric if you have  gotten all the information from the person you're talking to like for instance you go uh did you would  did you want to go on the air with the guys or do you need roland's office number what if you had 
[03:46:30]  said that i didn't yeah i just put him on hold and i started calling roland and then i and and you  said eric eric eric he's got everybody in on this fucking simple task of being on the phone when you're  on the phone you're on the phone it's not that difficult talking to one person you ask him what  this is pertaining to you get all the information and then you would have known by the way that  eric never needed to even know the hotline rang ever and he would have been there so i wasn't 
[03:47:00]  snoring into a microphone for 15 seconds like an idiot waiting for a music cue and then anthony  had to be the consummate professional and the bit is organic that he was doing with the music cue and  everything he had to come and do the whole thing again thank you sam robin exactly and in the  beginning knows how this is not a phone answerer guy right because you're like now you're doing it  on command and you're like i'm not i don't want to do this and then the music comes on and you have 
[03:47:30]  to just get yourself back into it it's a process exactly exactly uh well i'll i'll hang up again but  you just keep arguing sal boy you really know how to take responsibility all right thank you and  like could you at least say that the thing to have done in this situation would have simply to  have been find out who the guy is and then say oh did you want to go on the air or did you need 
[03:48:00]  roland's office number yes would that have been a better scenario and i will do that in the future  yes would you please apologize to eric for distracting him from his work sorry eric for  distracting you eric that's fine i i accept his apology would you please apologize uh to opie and  anthony sorry ona and jim that uh i took away from the show i took eric away from the show today when he  needed to be on his music cues okay i think you should also apologize to nuts from 96 yes i apologize to 
[03:48:30]  those nuts for making them smell like ammonia that wasn't your fault that's good that's good  don't apologize unless you did something wrong and give something that you'd like to say to roland  sorry roland for assuming that it was a personal call but even if even if it was a personal call  i mean you don't have any jurisdiction to be like you can't get personal calls here yeah roland's got a  lot of bitches right roland's got bitches and mad bitches that's his problem right that's the only  problem and apologize jesse may for her mtv time guys for sure all right and apologize because jesse 
[03:49:00]  may was planning on coming here i'm gonna have to come back and only talking about girl code and we  were just going to talk about it the whole time and i was going to nerd out sam i was going to ask  her questions about what girls do yeah we're going to talk about rob zombie we weren't going to talk  about phones the whole time or nuts but nuts i like talking about nuts it's always topical you may  have another apology to make jason in new jersey i mean john in new jersey uh hey sam uh i expect that  anthony will start drinking again today and uh we have to hold uh sal wholly responsible he was so 
[03:49:30]  aggravated on the phone you're right and he's very emotional also gill needs apology because he called  it he was the caller he was the caller ant hasn't had anything to drink in 12 days  sal holy shit could you please on the air right now make a plea to anthony to not let this affect his  newfound relationship with god and sobriety because i think that's why i don't remember if you use those  words specifically but yeah i say have a drink right now no rolling a nice cold beer salad 
[03:50:00]  sal if you would i'm sorry to amp but i think it should do it no no no no because he should not get  back on the wagon if it's because of you i think no that's certainly okay so please make a plea to  anthony uh please anthony do not get back to drinking uh because of the distress that i provided to you  today that's very good that was very good you did great today so way to go buddy i think we all  learned something ponderous well we only got a minute left in the show and i got to do a live  read alan yeah i know you tried to sneak in your asshole box didn't you yeah i did yeah i wonder
