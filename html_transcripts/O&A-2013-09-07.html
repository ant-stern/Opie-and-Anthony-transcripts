<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week" countdown, featuring Jim Norton's incredibly fortunate week spent with Black Sabbath.  Norton recounted humorous anecdotes from interviewing the band, including a car ride and concert with Ozzy Osbourne,  a backstage tour marred by an accidental purchase of merchandise, and Osbourne's pre-show solitude request.  A photo taken at Osbourne's house was also discussed.  Following this, Jake LaMotta and his girlfriend/wife joined the show.  LaMotta discussed his boxing career, including his fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three of his wives, and the accuracy of the movie *Raging Bull*. His girlfriend shared anecdotes about their relationship and his current life, including his stand-up comedy.  The conversation also touched upon LaMotta's age, health, and the Mafia's involvement in boxing.  Anthony Cumia then showcased several humorous videos of his new Bengal kitten, "Beavis," highlighting the kitten's antics, such as stealing his sunglasses.

The next segment focused on the departure of "the Radio Wizard" from Sirius XM and subsequent management changes.  Anthony Bourdain and Patton Oswalt were in-studio guests.  The show featured a profane and offensive farewell to the Radio Wizard, including a participation trophy and multiple goodbye songs, along with similarly offensive commentary about departing management (Gary, Steve Blattar, and Rob Cross).  The hosts discussed a racially insensitive *Happy Days* episode, highlighting problematic elements.  The segment also included advertising, mentions of upcoming shows with Art Bell and the Joe Rogan Experience, and discussion of Bourdain's travels and work on *Parts Unknown*, specifically his experiences in Detroit and Quebec.  Further comments on the *Happy Days* episode concluded this segment.

A significant portion of the broadcast involved a comedic reading of a fictional, racially charged 1970s-style television episode.  The episode depicted a white couple (the Cunninghams) hosting a Black couple's wedding, facing conflict with their violently abusive and racist neighbors, the Finleys.  The hosts and Patton Oswalt (who joined later) reacted to the episode's absurd and offensive dialogue, highlighting Mr. Finley's abuse of his wife and the use of racial slurs.  The hosts added their own commentary and jokes.  The episode's ending was left unresolved.  Later, the conversation briefly shifted to Patton Oswalt's career and his upcoming Moby Dick readings, and a mention of Jim Florentine promoting his podcast.  Several commercial breaks were included.

Jim Florentine then joined the show to discuss stand-up comedy and relationships.  He recounted negative experiences with stingy club owners, including underpayment incidents involving Dave Chappelle.  He criticized comedians who phone in their acts and those who switch to conservative AM radio after stand-up failure.  A significant portion focused on his observations of dysfunctional relationships, particularly women browbeating their partners, attributing this to portrayals of men as incompetent in media.  He emphasized self-respect and leaving relationships lacking trust, using the analogy of forcing a dog to be a cat.  He stressed the importance of leaving unhealthy relationships and the potential for long-term regret.

The final segment featured a lengthy, expletive-laden rant from a caller about his frustrations with his partner's perceived hypocrisy regarding independence. He used highly aggressive and insulting language. He advocated for leaving relationships without children if significant problems exist.  This was followed by a prank call from Jim Florentine featuring his "Special Ed Slow" bit, and a rapid-fire series of advertisements for Skechers (featuring Joe Montana), "Generation Iron," GetAroom.com, tax lawyers, teeth whitening products, a Metallica concert on SiriusXM, and the FX show "Sons of Anarchy."

[00:09:30]  here but nobody bothered me because i had the bed they were all just even when they moved fans  along who were kind of standing and just watching from like you know like it's like where the uh  wheelchair people sit i was staying behind them so i had a great view but they weren't the security  people they weren't yelling at people they were just moving people along but they were being really  nice like they weren't being jerk offs like they can be here and then after the show i went back  and um i was fucking he we hustled right out of there so i just you know we just we all ran to 
[00:10:00]  the car it was a part of the group that runs to the car oh pushing fans out of the way no there  were really no fans back there but even you know it was just there was three fucking suvs ready to go  and his was the lead one so of course i'm following uh ozzy back to his car which i would have done  anyway but now i was allowed to get in it and he jumps in and the guys jump in the back and they're ready  to go but i'm stuck outside because i don't know how to make my seat go back so my seat's folded down  so i'm holding everything up and i'm like put the fucking seat back i'm scared they're just gonna

[00:12:00]  was fucking really fun did you get to sleep over his house no sleep over there was no sleep over  put on your jammies and uh what do you have blown him let's get to the real question here  no just forgot to let's get let's get to it on the way home great savage show everyone's now relaxed  what would you do if he actually said that oh i would have been really disappointed only because i 
[00:12:30]  know he would have looked at me differently the next day if i did it disappointed yeah i would  be like oh man do i gotta all this this perfect day and now i'll be asked to blow me if i could  oh no it ends like it would have ended with me if i was a chick  like if i was in the car and a girl got a ride i would have asked to blow me  but it was just how did the night end though so now do they drop you back off at ozzy's house  you go to ozzy's first and then the go inside for a little nightcap no no nobody went in he was 
[00:13:00]  tired man kissed on the front seat yeah he just said good night there buddy you know how it is  you get a little hug that's awesome good seeing you jim oh look at that yeah it was really a fun  he's what a fucking great guy man and i forget what he said he really made me laugh though it was  it was fucking yeah we've said it i mean he's been in here what five or six times now he is  hilariously funny he really is funny man and it was just a great great fucking like you can't  have but i didn't feel like a contest winner fanboy yeah yeah it seemed almost like a you 
[00:13:30]  know a contest winner like thing like you get so lucky to go to the show but it was does he seem  lonely just because he's so famous like it sounds like there wasn't a lot of like people around  no because except for people doing their jobs obviously the people around him are are people  who he's he's not i wouldn't say he's lonely he's got so many people that want to be around him  and like i noticed that but that could be that could be lonely because those people  you know are they truly you know friends or well the people that he has that he selects to be around 
[00:14:00]  him before a show are people he's close to like the guys john and dave and billy's a friend they're  all they're not just handlers they're like people he's really close to it's like it's like literally  like having three or four of your closer friends around you and then you know with all the people  that work for him have worked for him for years and so i felt like i was almost an interloper like  i was with these people that have this very intimate relationship and and they were all great and it 
[00:14:30]  was it was comfortable but that's yeah i almost didn't want to be a fucking outsider but you know  again it was just a fun hang and ride and i was so glad i could talk about movies and i didn't talk  about the fucking album or you know what kind of houses you have big um i it's funny i didn't see  this is why i love sharon because it was done in i you saw the picture i twittered it was me no i i  was sort of off twitter a lot i twittered a photo it was from a screen it was from somebody's iphone  like one of the camera guys just happened to snap an iphone picture so it's not as clear as it could

[00:29:00]  home you know what it means to come home to a beautiful lovely gorgeous lady who gives you a lot of  love affection tenderness it means you've been in the wrong damn apartment  fair enough she hasn't gotten any better all right i was afraid i thought i said that joke no no no no  no no not at all we that's all right whatever it doesn't matter to me yeah please i have a i forget 
[00:29:30]  quickly anyway we're just happy you're here so uh you know what do you what do you do with yourself  now i mean uh you know obviously you're out and about you're promoting i mean uh what is a typical  jake lamont a day at age 92 91 91 sorry i didn't mean to get a line there uh at age 91  what you gotta ask the boss so what does he do yeah yeah what does he do on a daily basis oh on a  typical day he wakes up does um goes to the store buys the papers shadow boxes a little bit reads the 
[00:30:00]  paper eats a little breakfast do you still watch boxing at all do you still watch it or you lose  interest oh i watch it occasionally how about ufc uh mixed martial arts do you like that or no  i've seen it once i think hmm you liked it or no yeah i like it who do you like in boxing  sugar robertson oh good anybody that's have you you fought him right oh yeah 
[00:30:30]  wow so when you met jake and and this guy is waving you over yeah do you have to kind of go  back and so funny he was wearing he was 1992 and he was wearing a baby blue leisure suit you know  from the 70s and he was beckoning me over and i just kind of just know who he was and finally i  went over and said hello and praz was there his friend who was dressed to the nines and 
[00:31:00]  all of us weren't feeling any pain so we we had a little laugh and um then i like i said i went home  to arizona which is where i was from at that point and i still have property there and uh about a year  later well things happen in life and i moved back here nice do you uh and jake it's it's you you've  i think testified that you had thrown a fight and is that one of those things that you look back on  and you regret do you have feelings about that the fight that the mob kind of got you to throw 
[00:31:30]  yeah i didn't say yes i did but there's nothing i could do about it i had to play both uh one fight  because you wanted the marcel sedan fight yeah before i put marcel sedan and he was a great fighter  from europe and uh and it happened that i met him well gee tell us about laurent d'artuil 
[00:32:00]  tell us about that fight uh uh i felt no right don't feel it was 23 seconds left of the 15th round  i could not win the fight but i knocked him down they counted the time there was 23 seconds left to  the fight i was very very lucky to retain my title ring magazine called that the toughest  come from behind fight of all time well it was amazing to watch all i was watching footage of the 
[00:32:30]  robinson fights and it's interesting to me like what was it about you that you just wouldn't go down  is it because you stayed so close or are you amazing how you wouldn't fall that was my style  i i got less punches by being aggressive i got less punches the other guy was so anxious so ready to  protect themselves that they live right back and it was a very good idea to keep it close and keep 
[00:33:00]  about throwing punches and nothing back it up i don't know how to back up he still doesn't know  how to back up today he doesn't know how to back up he really doesn't so that style in the ring is  actually who he is yeah that was that was that was the the great stuff to watch was this inability  and did you did you like fighting uh more as a uh a middleweight or you went up to light heavyweight  at one point or no i fought so i fought was light heavyweights the little guys didn't want to fight 
[00:33:30]  me oh they wouldn't fight you no so i fought the big guys all big light heavyweights all bigger than me  and they wanted me to back up and i don't know how so i used to observe all the punches that they threw  at me i smothered it i smothered the punches just so they didn't get the full power behind me yeah  they said you would you would kind of go with a punch right you would kind of take it and move with  it i had an act that brought him with a punch because also the guys i thought i would be around 
[00:34:00]  here talking to you if i didn't learn something about protecting myself right so you were maybe a  better defensive boxer than people gave you credit for that's right you're pretty smart whoa you're  the first person to ever say great aggressiveness is the best defense they don't know that they don't  understand that but by being aggressive i avoided getting less punches that way now the injuries you 
[00:34:30]  took back then i mean was there were there any injuries you took that you thought might end your career  at any point no not that i could think of i first i i all the time i was fighting i was thinking of  being the best of my ability the first when you first started fighting in 1941 what was the money like 
[00:35:00]  that was 1941 yeah what was the money like in the 40s that's so big it wasn't big right like what was  the typical like like early in the early fights what was a typical purse 50 and a watch 50 and a watch  and do you get jealous when you see guys now fighting these fights and making 10 million well power to 
[00:35:30]  what they can make the better i like it because i know how tough it is in the beginning trying to get  there it's not that easy it's very very tough to get started so i had to develop a reputation and  the name that nobody could knock me down no one can knock you down that kind of became your the  thing that attracted people to seeing you right uh do you think that does does the mob influence in 
[00:36:00]  boxing which it was for a long time do you think it's still there or do you think a lot of that's kind  of gone away no it's gone it is gone i think so what do you think ended it i don't know it wasn't  worth it was the keyfarber committee did they did they have something that was a long time ago but  didn't they have something to do with the decline of the mafia in the boxing industry i think they did  the nation probably mr lamota this is senator kefauver you know he went before the senate subcommittee 
[00:36:30]  on racketeering and boxing so the senator kefauver said mr lamota and how can you  on five thousand dollars a year afford to keep a girl at the waldorf astoria it's not easy  she does these impersonations i think it was the real people 
[00:37:00]  i know what i want to ask would you uh the thing about not having sex before a fight  is that a myth or is that true i think it is true but that bothers me because i said i stayed away from  it you stayed away from it it just bothered your wife because i had to fight tough guys i for all  tough guys because i i didn't bother nobody and i thought the bigger they are the better the better 
[00:37:30]  i liked it i went right after them short i was still all bigger and taller than me  and that's what happened were you scared i don't think i was ever scared i developed such a habit of  protecting myself in a ring that i fought everybody and i wasn't afraid of no one i bought nobody i fought 
[00:38:00]  them all would the uh the younger contenders kind of avoid you or have to be forced to fight you  they weren't forced to fight me i was forced to fight them  god guys were more experienced than i and i said i i bought nobody i for all the black men  the black men liked me because i gave them gave them opportunities to make some money a lot of the 
[00:38:30]  fighters wouldn't fight the black fighters no they wouldn't fight the black guys so i fought all the  black guys most of them were black few of them were white were the white guys scared of you  i guess so and the black guys needed the money and nobody else would fight them so they  don't know what else would fight them nobody else would fight me so we fought each other  and became friends with them and that was at a time where those friendships were kind of 
[00:39:00]  it was tough to make a living in those days it was tough and when you when after fighting you you  opened jake lamotta's place in uh florida and how long did you have that for don't mention it  don't mention it no i mean you could mention a lot of problems a lot of problems yeah he's not too  smart anymore now huh jimmy you're not too smart now well you know i have to because i'm getting 
[00:39:30]  into the nightclub act now is that when you started doing your nightclub act when you had your own place  and it would kind of bring people in to see you yes now were you always a funny guy like uh i don't  know if i was always a funny guy but a lot of my jokes don't work so good but but jake when you  were young you were mean tough vicious i mean tough vicious cruel pressure then i retired from the ring  and i went into show business now my greatest pleasure is making people laugh and if you don't laugh 
[00:40:00]  he puts up his left hand yes a good fist to the mouth now do you use shadow box every she knows  the questions to ask me and throw up once in a while while he's talking and i answer your question  it's the same thing you're doing what he's doing okay yeah we're both just asking questions and he's  right basically if i'm yammering on about something just interrupt and ask a question because i'm not too  sure what to ask why the cowboy hat i like the cowboy hat i love it as well i have it 
[00:40:30]  and people seem to like it so i keep i wear it well that same stubbornness that same  kind of is the same thing that wouldn't let you go down in the ring i didn't want to say it like that  jake but you can i felt it was better to throw it out there and see if you picked up on but you  that's the same thing that wouldn't let you fall in the ring it was that same plow through and not  stop uh mentality right probably you're right you diagnosed that pretty good oh yeah jimmy's smart 
[00:41:00]  again yeah back to being smart but that's it there's a stubbornness to not going down in the ring because  there's times i saw a part of that north it was fried what's that too much too much pride yeah it's the  same thing i watched that nordico fight and there was times where you're holding onto the ring nordico's  beating you and hitting you hard and it was after your slip and you're holding onto the ring with your  right hand and you're punching with your left hand and you're holding the ring so you don't go down 
[00:41:30]  and i'm like any other fighter would have fallen down but you're holding the ring rope i've never  seen anybody actually physically do that i don't know sometimes it's stupid he's a terrific man  he really is he's got a huge heart he's a very nice gentle soul yeah and your royalty i mean in  in boxing the other the other boxers uh treat you like uh very well don't they i guess so  oh yeah he's the godfather of boxing at this point there's nobody older yeah is there anybody 
[00:42:00]  left from that era that fought ray robinson and fought all these uh you know again sugar  ray robinson's dead god god bless his soul you guys became friends or you were friends we were  friends we were good friends too sugar ray was his um he had a lot of pride he had a lot of pride i  had a lot of pride he was looking to knock me down and i was looking to stand up and charge him 
[00:42:30]  and throw as much faster as he threw at me i threw at him and they're all close fights you don't fight  six times unless they're close and these were close fights i said i fought sugar ray so many times  it's the one that i don't have diabetes  i said that joke a couple of times already  i didn't catch it that's fine it's a good one every time jake what the hell

[00:57:30]  kitten said for wasting my time so i put it up at what two in the morning this morning i think so  oh did you tweet it it was pretty yeah to but like at 2 a.m it's already up to 3 100 i haven't  retweeted or anything it just takes to get onto one of those fucking sites one of those pet lunatic  sites where it's just like oh a kitty kitty yeah get in trouble for those sites no not that oh there 
[00:58:00]  he's next to a a bullet and he's he's very tiny holy shit is that that's yeah yeah he's uh  you gotta you gotta put a gun in your kitten video you think i need a gun yeah there's gotta be away  you gotta you gotta make it to his head you gotta make a kitten video every week yeah yeah just keep  pumping him out you know i'll i i just retweeted the video oh sadly thank you sadly 
[00:58:30]  oh there he is  oh boy did i  that's true right my viral video came with a million death threats that was fun  that's what you want oh man and then there's a couple of vines how much of the how much did beavis  cost you thousands no no beavis was pretty cheap why is he cheap is that a tough breed to get no not 
[00:59:00]  really a good a good one you know i didn't want one with like a lot of marbling on them apparently  you want one with like the spots you know what's marbling it's when the the color is just kind of  all like blotchy on them but i wanted the one with the spots so he looks like a leopard and then um  i got him before he got all of his shots so i got to pay for the shots so we put the price down for  that what was it but it's like a grand okay it's not that much you're gonna get another one no two cats 
[00:59:30]  are perfect oh there he is uh i'm playing with his little nose don't waste your viral videos with vine  man no it's not viral i'm just playing with his little nose and he uh right to the youtube i was  shook a shook a all right but we're licking your finger yes but let's move that one to youtube  oh and then he jumps and he falls so he jumps and tries to swap my finger and he falls over because 
[01:00:00]  he's too tiny oh little guy doesn't know how to proportion his body weight yet that asshole he has no  idea and uh this one oh oh look he's playing with a little uh bracelet he's just biting he likes to  play  here he is eating a big bunch of food i know that i noticed that your angry tweets were drastically down  so you think it's helping i think the kitten is helping there's definitely a correlation between 
[01:00:30]  your angry tweets dropping and the fact that you got this beautiful little might be you might have  something there so let's get you a kitten every three months i think um let's get these these are  horrible habits you're teaching it oh i know just going after uh as you try to tie your shoes and  yeah he's gonna go after your ding-a-ling one day like that i used to play fight with my cat when he  was a kitten it was cute yeah sam yeah now he's about 20 pounds and just waits for somebody to come 
[01:01:00]  home so he can pounce oh shit yeah he's like the fucking like the fucking butler and uh pink  panther the asian helper yes i just hate though just like this idea of a fun time is he sneaks up to  you and you pet him you know and he's like oh i'm just here for a cuddle and then wraps his paws  around you and sinks his claws of teeth into your arm man hard so i can't wait to stop that anthony's  injured by this cuteness no and he's playing with his hands like you're supposed to do you can't

[01:07:30]  wizard before he's been a thorn in the side of opie and anthony for quite some time now well  this was for all intents and purposes apparently his last week with the show i guess they're in some  kind of transitional period right now but we have a new boss so you'd think the old boss would i don't  know either way we said goodbye to the radio wizard this week in style in song in gift in everything you 
[01:08:00]  can imagine with or without gary present we celebrated the career of the radio wizard on  the opie anthony show  collect uh the radio wizards tears and maybe they could come up with a new flavor up there  why would he cry you mean because he doesn't want to leave the show baldy salty tears popcorn 
[01:08:30]  he doesn't have much of a choice in the matter i don't think he's out he's done right you're out tom  he is done today well he's we're still in the transitional period how long does the transitional  period last till the transition but how long is that i don't know next week  i'm gonna guess yeah um yes within the week next week uh i would say it'll be done once again we're  saying goodbye to management it seems to happen a lot once again no more dealing with gary 
[01:09:00]  or um steve i guess right yeah steve blatter i guess or or rob cross or rob cross that's right i  barely see rob cross he interacts more he's just usually in a pretty good mood  so we got a couple things we want to play for yeah gary even though everyone's leaving 
[01:09:30]  that's right where's the steve blatter goodbye song or the rob cross medley well we just  troy and i worked on what was requested oh okay we're basically short order cooks here  exclusively radio wizard you guys said you wanted to say goodbye to gary and wanted a  celebration for him so we have a gift for him we do have a gift and a couple of uh yeah it's right 
[01:10:00]  there in the middle of the table we did get a participation trophy yes for gary i hope he's  appreciative you think he will be i hope he will come down and join us for a celebration  i don't see anyone i don't see it happening oh i don't see a silhouette of a light bulb walking  down the hall we asked him  and he's going to finance that was the rumor but i was told he's not going to finance  he's going to finance oh it's pretty obvious did you ask him if he's going to finance come down 
[01:10:30]  i did not personally but i'm asking him right now i'm sure he's listening gary please i don't  know if he listens anymore i guess he doesn't have why would he why would he be listening to us  beat him up if he has nothing to do with us nobody in finance listens to us no for old time's sake  can we just beat him up every once in a while i don't think we could stop you if we wanted to  it's not going to feel the same though it won't no and uh the breaking news was that tim sabian's  going to be running the channel and doing some other things here at sirius xm after his hiatus 
[01:11:00]  he was gone for a while so we took a little time off too we're trying jim he's not answering the  phone whoa whoa okay eric where's that coming from right that's coming from a place of hate  sir right being cross wow eric we're trying i can't get him on the phone what do you think of the  what do you think of uh the changes around here eric we haven't gotten your opinion i think it's 
[01:11:30]  a step in the right direction whoa wow that's a little controversial and it sure is what are you  saying with that you know he's voicing his displeasure with former management right still  current because we're in transitional period future former management yeah yeah yeah  uh with the old in with the new wow wow this isn't a uh meet the new boss same as the old boss  situation by the way no there's no down my mind things will get better immediately all right well 
[01:12:00]  we'll be marking this show for drops okay fair enough with that why don't we say goodbye to uh the radio  wizard yeah let's do it the opening anthony way yeah he's a radio wizard  when he sat down with me and steve blatter said here's the radio wizard he's gonna get you to  radio wizard are you a radio guy yes i'm already all right so help us figure it out what do you 
[01:12:30]  know what do you mean what do i know so i was right we could blame the radio wizard because if the  guy is the the guy that's overseeing everything  nothing gets done obvious things that need to get done yeah you gotta blame him  gary made uh the staff pay for their sandwiches yesterday 
[01:13:00]  gary what are you doing gary how how much could a sandwich  be it was seven bucks yeah 13 bucks so why wouldn't the company just pick up lunch everybody's  getting reimbursed  oh by the way we should have talked about buffing the head because uh the radio wizard just walked  by he's a buffer  the only person that got his passport was the guy who was there to remind everybody to remember 
[01:13:30]  their passport right i gotta give kenny credit i was looking through his list of getting picked up  and the word on the top passports but there was one other guy who helped make this thing happen  everybody give it up for gary wherever he is give it up for gary  come on come on oh that's surprising you all come up why why would you boo gary 
[01:14:00]  very small  wow that uh that was haunting yeah it's very touching if you didn't know better you would think uh  gary started uh just before our montreal broadcast yeah that wasn't all montreal  very nice no some of that was uh cleveland and all kinds of memories with gary just a tribute to  his participation all right which we have the trophy for but yeah but he's not uh he's not coming 
[01:14:30]  down for his trophy now i asked him oh what is that to come in and he said no  oh and i said why oh he said because i don't want to uh-huh fair fair point well i guess we have time  to play the second goodbye song now why are we going to get even more sad yes yes  people get two goodbye songs on the op and anthony show don't they oh i've never heard of that yeah 
[01:15:00]  oh  what'd you say  Bye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  If you don't go away, yeah, go away 
[01:15:30]  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye  So long, farewell, I'll be here saying adieu  Adieu, adieu to you and you and you  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Na, na, na, na.  Okay.  Na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Woo.  Na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye. 
[01:16:30]  Bye-bye.  Na, na, na, na.  Woo.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Watch that door.  Oh, let it hit that ass.  Yeah, that ass.  Peace goodbye.  Sorry, darling.  Our number is festive.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  We're good.  We're long.  Up-tempo number. 
[01:17:00]  It's still going.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Na, na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  That was...  Well missed.  I'm quite emotional.  We're all in here eating sweet popcorn.  Anyone else notice we're done talking about Gary?  That's it.  I've moved on to popcorn.  We did the trip here.  Why would the cinnamon popcorn that, by the way, we've already covered here on the show,  outshine Gary's goodbye? 
[01:17:30]  Well, you know, the last thing was to give him his participation trophy and he refuses to come in.  He literally covered cinnamon popcorn ten minutes ago.  Yeah.  It's still delicious, though.  Finance?  I'm going to make a demand.  What's the demand?  That trophy stays right where it is until he gets it.  I don't want it thrown away.  I don't want it in the office.  Do Ron and Fez have to leave it there?  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:18:00]  Make sure the boys get the message.  No one touches Gary's participation trophy.  Because you don't want anybody to disrespect his legacy.  That's right.  What does the trophy say again for the people that are just turning in?  Why are you asking me?  Well, it's not turned my way right now.  It doesn't seem appropriate for the...  Well, maybe.  Well, it says, world's greatest secretary.  That's what it says on it.  Looks like a little Academy Award figurine on top. 
[01:18:30]  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But for a secretary.  Yeah.  Nice.  Why is Jimmy again?  What?  You don't think he would appreciate this, Jimmy?  Is that what you're getting at?  No, I don't hope.  No.  No more elevator meetings.  Now we could sit in big boy chairs and have real meetings.  What?  Right?  You're going to have real meetings now?  I always wanted a real meeting if it meant getting real things done. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  So you're saying on record you are willing to have a sit down big boy meeting with Tim.  In a big comfy chair in an office.  Do you feel like you're going to have creative meetings now?  Yes.  God.  What?  It was amazing.  Because if you come up with an idea, even a part of an idea, someone like Tim, he can  cultivate that.  Right.  He knows how to do it.  I mean, elevator meetings were fine for those guys.  Sure.  But now it's time to have big boy meetings. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  No more turning your video camera on and sticking it in their face so they don't have a meeting  with you because they don't want to be filmed.  No more of that.  Well, that might have happened a couple of times.  No, no one would ever do that.  There were demands that did not make my YouTube channel.  They demanded.  I do remember more than one time you being told, you can film this all you want, but  you're not to post it.  Yeah.  The only reason why I didn't post it, that it was boring as all hell. 
[01:20:00]  Just like the record show.  Right.  You going to miss him?  You know, it would be good to say hi to him in the halls.  I've heard people with chronic diseases that after years and years have actually been cured  of the disease, miss having the disease.  Oh, a little bit.  What's it called?  Stockholm Syndrome.  No, it's not called Stockholm Syndrome. 
[01:20:30]  What's it called?  Munchhausen.  Yeah, that's when you're kidnapped and you begin to...  No, but it's the same principle.  It's an odd reversal of this.  Like, if Gary was a disease for us...  Oh, you're talking about...  I thought I was from the wrong perspective.  Gary is a disease.  No, he was a disease.  The chronic disease.  And Sabine is the cure.  Hey, the cure.  Yeah.  So you'll miss being sick with a disease.  Right.  Some people actually miss that. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  So in that way, people could miss Gary, a.k.a. the disease.  A.k.a. Baldy, a.k.a. the disease.  You know who I feel really sorry for?  Who's that?  Sal.  Why?  Because we're gonna...  beat someone up.  Oh.  And you know, we spread it out, because there were so many, so many fucking idiots around  us.  Sal had a hell of a meeting yesterday.  Yeah, what happened with Sal in the meeting?  Honestly, Sal had a hell of a meeting during the first hour of the show. 
[01:21:30]  Oh!  What happened?  He's just been having a rough time.  We've been trying to get some...  Rough time of it?  Clips together, and ideas of timeliness are not translating throughout the staff as well  as one would like.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because starting tomorrow, we don't even talk about him anymore.  The Radio Wizard.  He's gone.  All those guys are gone.  And he's gone.  So you're saying...  There's nothing we can do about it.  It's bad news for Sal that there are less and less idiots because...  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 
[01:22:00]  That's what you're saying.  When you're lost in the pool of idiots.  Because I know how I am.  Right.  You're a...  I'm in the category of, I can't help myself.  When you're a small idiot in a big pond.  Right, right.  It's, uh...  Okay.  He better get his shit together.  I would shave that dumb mustache of his immediately.  So he blends in better.  He's realizing there's room to do a backstroke in the idiot pond.  Yes!  Oh, yes!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Clearing out the idiots. 
[01:22:30]  You know, so I want to thank Gary, you know, for...  You know, showing up.  Years of faithful...  Walking around with his cup of coffee making believe he was busy.  Busy.  Thinking about the show constantly.  You know.  Well...  Yeah.  Thinking about or worrying about?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  That was just a nice thing to say.  You didn't...  Never had a relationship with him whatsoever.  I have no idea. 
[01:23:00]  Never even had...  No?  I don't know.  I've never had a deal number the last couple months.  Hmm.  I always had a nice time working with him.  Yeah.  Good for you.  There you go.  Yeah, I did.  That's nice.  He's pleasant enough.  Travis, what are your feelings?  Just hanging out.  Just hanging out.  The worst is yet to come.

[01:28:00]  Yes, sir.  It's Sam Roberts from Opie and Anthony.  And after Opie and Anthony live here on The Worst of the Week Countdown,  it's my birthday weekend.  And I'm still doing this for you.  You're welcome.  Actually, I mean, I get paid for it.  So it's also my job that I have to do.  Anthony Bourdain was in studio.  In a little bit, I'm going to play for you Patton Oswalt in studio.  I'm going to play for you the Happy Days episode.  But there are very few guests that can measure up to Anthony Bourdain  because this is a guy who's a world traveler.  He tastes every weird food there is. 
[01:28:30]  And he doesn't mind talking shit.  That's what makes him different from any other quote-unquote celebrity chef.  Anthony, chef, I think I just said it.  Chef.  There's no T or D at the end of that word.  Anthony Bourdain stopped by the show this week.  It was another great appearance.  If you don't believe me, you can listen to it.  Number three.  Anthony Bourdain.  There he is.  Welcome, sir.  Hello.  Hey, guys. How you doing?  How you doing?  How are you? 
[01:29:00]  I feel like we just saw you.  Yeah, right?  It's probably been a while.  You're all tan.  Yeah, I just got back from vacation last night.  So we just got back to Hamptons.  Ah!  I went totally over to the dark side.  You did.  Do you like it?  This was only the second normal vacation in my life.  Yeah, without having to go somewhere very far away.  Were you getting recognized out there?  I think, you know, the natural inclination would say,  you know, you're on a permanent vacation, motherfucker.  Yeah, true.  True. 
[01:29:30]  This is the first time that I've actually done the sort of normal month barbecue in the backyard.  Nice.  You know, super dad thing.  So, like, I've kind of overcompensated.  I've become this sort of manic, like, manic, frenetic, like, psychotic, you know, super dad.  Yeah, yeah.  I've gone full Ina.  You know?  You did.  You know, everybody get together.  We're having all the greatest hits from my Jersey Shore, you know, childhood vacations.  You know, we're having the goddamn steamers and the lobster, too. 
[01:30:00]  You'll eat your fucking corn and I'm getting the tomatoes at the farm stand and you'll enjoy it.  You know, you get the nine different choice of nine different pancakes.  And I'm like, you know, it's like way, way, way, way, way over the top.  Uh-huh.  We had similar summers, sir.  Didn't dig any holes for the kids.  Yeah.  I was digging holes every day on the beach.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had to hit water with your damn hole.  Yeah.  I just had to say, normal family.  Normal family.  Right.  Let's be normal.  And it got so crazy we were doing our own clamming.  Yeah.  Did you do that?  I haven't done it. 
[01:30:30]  That's a really good idea.  It's awesome.  When you feel a clam with your big toe, there's nothing better.  Well, there's nothing better.  I'm telling you.  I can think of a better thing to feel a clam with.  I'm like, I'm like the most considerate driver to like in the Hamptons because, you know,  I drive like a black foreign car.  Uh-huh.  And every other douchebag who goes to the Hamptons for the summer drives.  So, like, I really go out of my way.  I'm hyper aware having worked summer jobs and been sort of a local in a vacation meeting. 
[01:31:00]  You know, I know what it's like to be a local and have all of these douchebags and  femurs coming into your town.  I'm like, I really try hard, super hard to not be that guy.  Right.  It's almost impossible though sometimes, right?  It is.  Yeah.  Every stoplight.  Yes.  Small and local.  No.  I don't give anybody any leeway these days on a red light.  If they're in front of me at a red light, or an arrow especially, and I'm behind them,  and they don't move the second it turns, I know that they're texting or something. 
[01:31:30]  They're not paying attention to the light.  So, I'm like, there it is.  There it is.  Green.  I'm like, not in a second.  Do they ever catch them looking in the mirror like, ah, what the fuck?  Yeah, and then I just go, go.  See, for me, I don't do that because I'm hyper aware at all times that there's, generally  speaking, someone in the car with an even shorter fuse and a lower threshold than me.  And my wife is there.  Oh.  So, two seconds, it's, I kill you with my bad hands, you mother fucker, you know. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, you can.  And she can, which makes it more troubling.  I met your wife.  Yes.  In, um, it was, uh, in Vegas at the, uh, UFC.  She was in the back area where all the fighters are, actually.  Yep.  And, uh, Reed Harris introduced us.  She was very lovely.  She chatted very briefly.  And she could kick some ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As we all know.  Ah, that's handy.  Yeah, I guess she was there for the fight.  Oh, you don't have to deal with that when your wife says something, you gotta step in  and settle the, the dispute.  Oh, no, no. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  No, it's exactly the opposite, you know.  Good for you.  And, uh, she was, you know who she is?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  She's lovely.  Yeah, she, um, she looked really good.  I'm looking forward to the, what is it, the Ultimate Fighter?  Yeah.  On tonight, yeah.  It's, uh, is it, it's Ronda Rousey and Misha Tate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tonight starts tonight.  It's gonna be great.  Yeah, we'll be watching that at my house.  If she stretches on the show, then that's all.  Oh, my gosh.  She stretched Anthony Bourdain.  We've lost our minds.  She's so fantastic and sexy.  Holy crap. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, but, I gotta say, I saw the whole season of Parts Unknown.  I loved it.  I know you're here to promote, uh, The Getaway, but I loved Parts Unknown.  Thanks.  You going to Libya?  The 15th, it starts again.  Again?  Yeah.  Uh, and the, the best episode, I think, was Quebec.  You were eating some weird shit up there.  I like what, you know, one of the joys of making the show is that, you know, one week  it's Libya, uh, obviously a pretty serious show.  Right.  You know, the next, I'm basically just stuffing food into my, rich food into my face in, in, 
[01:33:30]  in Quebec.  You almost said food into my rich face.  Yeah.  But that was, that was about as, as, as over the top, uh, you know, food, food centric,  self-indulgent show as I've ever made.  What is beaver taste?  It was beaver, right?  Yeah.  Surprisingly good.  Doesn't sound like it could possibly be good, you know?  Yeah.  Cause it's kind of rodent-y.  Well, you would think it'd be oily and rodent-y, but it's actually, you know, more in the,  I'm not going to say it tastes like chicken. 
[01:34:00]  You say it!  Say it!  Say it!  Chicken!  Goddammit!  Oh man.  It's always chicken.  I guess it, uh, depends on how it's prepared, right?  Uh, yeah.  Like anything.  I'm sure there's a way to fuck it up.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, you can fuck up chicken easily, you know.  Pop it in the microwave.  It does nuke some fever.  This year it's, uh, Israel, West Bank, Gaza, uh, show, uh, Spain, uh, really dark, really,  I have no idea.  I don't know if the network's even seen the Tokyo show, but we did a very deranged, uh, 
[01:34:30]  Tokyo show about the sort of the connection between, uh, sort of fetishism and repressed  Japanese sexuality and porn.  Wow.  So there's a lot of hentai, tentacles, uh, bondage, uh, and sushi.  Wow.  And sushi.  Let's throw in the sushi.  And we do the Detroit show, Denmark, and it's going to be a good one.  How bad is Detroit these days?  You know, I love the, look, that's a city I really, really love. 
[01:35:00]  And, and I, you know, Detroiters really hate it when people from outside go in and  say, wow, it's really awesome.  It looks like ancient Rome.  Look at these ruins taking pictures.  Romans don't like that either, but, but you can't look away.  I mean, it really is.  It's, it looks like Chernobyl and I don't, that's not a joke.  It looks like I've been to Chernobyl.  It looks like Chernobyl, um, overgrown, you know, all of these 70,000 unoccupied, uh, you  know, vacant buildings.  Uh, it's just incredible structures just left to, to rot. 
[01:35:30]  You know, fields, you know, waist high grass and, and, you know, old gardens.  The house isn't there anymore, but the gardens are now sort of growing wild.  It's pretty amazing, but, um, you know, it's a tragic, but awesome place.  I mean, if you, if you don't like Detroit, you know, how you feel about Detroit is one  thing.  Here's another thing.  That's a city with a sense of humor.  I guess you have to have one, but, uh, it's just a place I've loved for a long time. 
[01:36:00]  What do you do on that episode without giving it away?  Um, we hanging out with a guy, uh, Charlie Ladoff, who wrote a go, a former New York Times  reporter and now a reporter for, uh, uh, television station in Detroit and, uh, you know, born and  raised and, uh, wrote a great book called Detroit and American autopsy.  And, uh, so we basically hung out with, you know, old school Detroit, uh, politicians,  cops, firemen.  Um, you know, it's definitely not the new, you know, hipster pizzeria that you must know 
[01:36:30]  about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are they going to do to fix that place?  I mean, there's no reason that American city should be in that bad a shape.  It's going to have to shrink.  I mean, that's, uh, what, I mean, what, what would be nice to happen and what will probably  happen are two different things.  I mean, what would be nice to happen is all the people who've, who've hung out there and  fought it out and, and survived and, and held onto their homes as everybody around them,  you know, burned down or ran away or turned into crack houses. 
[01:37:00]  You know, it would be great if, if the future of a, the future of Detroit included them.  I, I don't know that it will, you know, I think it'll, it'll definitely shrink.  It's down from over 2 million people to a city of 700,000.  It's 134 square miles.  So police and fire coverage is forget about.  I mean, they don't have computers, you know, the, the, you know, the national crime control  computers in, uh, in the police cars, they use their own cell phones sometimes to call  in.  They take, they take the bus to murder scenes. 
[01:37:30]  It's not unheard of.  Um, it's pretty ludicrous.  Uh, wow.  But what will happen?  I think it'll, it'll probably be like the Lower East Side, you know, uh, people living  on the Lower East Side are not the people who, you know, lived there, who, who grew up there  and then who lived through all the bad times.  They have to re, uh, readjust borders and districts.  And that's the biggest pain in the ass.  Cause it all comes down to who's getting the money, um, for, uh, being within city limits. 
[01:38:00]  You start pulling in the city limits and now that no man's land outside, what happens  to that?  Yeah.  How does that get developed?  Yeah.  It's a big, big question.  But we don't want people overlook is it is an incredible, it is a beautiful city.  It's beautiful.  I mean, even the buildings that are maintained, they're gorgeous.  And it's just about everything cool in America.  It's not the world came from Detroit or Detroit, especially the automobile, the credit card,  uh, you know, the music of Detroit, it's, you know, it's everything American. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  If we can't get it right there, you know, we really should sort of fold up our tents.  How did it fall so far into the toilet?  Was it just the auto industry collapsing?  Uh, the auto, it, it, it shrunk.  Uh, basically the auto certainly didn't help the audio of the auto industry started to contract.  I mean, so, you know, you went from a city of 2 million people down to 700,000.  It started the decline really started in the fifties.  Oh, really?  Quite some time.  And there was a lot of, uh, you know, not just white flight, but black middle class flight. 
[01:39:00]  Um, but decades of really spectacular political corruption.  Yeah.  How many mayors in a row have been in the joint now, but it's quite a number of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, it's, uh, it, you know, they've, they've had more than their share of, uh, of, of problems.  Did you see hope there, Anthony?  Any hope at all?  Uh, or was it just downright depressing for you?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Because they're, they are obstinate.  Uh, they're obstinate, proud, funny, tough as hell.  Um, you know, any time you, you have that in a, in a, in a, you know, in a city's character,  there's going to be hope.  Right.  Um, but I think, you know, whatever happens, a lot of people who deserve better are going  to end up getting screwed.  I think that's, that's the way it always plays out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, even on a neighborhood by neighborhood, you know, a basis you look at, like, you know,  the meat district or the Lower East side here, Hell's Kitchen, you know, you look at the 
[01:40:00]  neighborhood then and who lives there now.  Right.  You know, first come, first come the artists, you know, then come the boutique hotels and  then the, you know, swarms of hipster douchebags.  It's different though in a small area like New York, like, you know, because you, you can  move into say the Lower East side and you're still only a quick ride to Chelsea or we're at  midtown.  Like Detroit being spread out that far, even if you like gentrify one area, then the rest 
[01:40:30]  of it is still a shithouse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really hard.  It seems like something that big to, because hipsters do in a weird way save certain places.  Colin Quinn pointed out to me too.  They're ballsy.  Like as much as it's fun to trash them, and I do, they move into fucking Bedford Stuyvesant  and these fucking white guys with bell bottoms and fucking beetle hairdos taking the subway  to Bed-Stuy at two in the morning.  There's certain balls to that.  The man is right.  And they're already there like, you know, artists, urban farmers, a lot of people making 
[01:41:00]  use of the, you know, there's a lot of dead space in it.  People are growing stuff and producing, you know, local vegetables and produce for underserved  areas.  Look, there's no doubt about it.  Hipsters will, you know, to the extent that these places are going to get saved.  Yeah.  It's going to be somebody with an ironic beard and a pack of American spirits in the front  pocket.  Nice.  Yeah.  What's this now?  The Getaway. 
[01:41:30]  What you're working on?  Well, The Getaway is one of our Esquire channel and it's basically, you know, I used  to do a show called The Layover where I'd go and do 24, 48 hours in a city.  Um, my partners and I started thinking, well, this would be actually a much better concept  if we got people who were actually had some connection to these places and knew what to  do in those places where, you know, uh, so we are basically grabbing people who've accomplished  things in their lives, who are funny, who've got something going on, who have a particular 
[01:42:00]  connection with a place, um, and would, you know, are good at, would be the right person  to drop into these locations and we sent them off and let them loose.  So we have, um, Joel McHale we sent to Ireland to, uh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Um, and, uh, Aisha Tyler to Paris and, uh, let's see who else is on the show, Aziz Ansari.  Um, so we sort of try to, you know, look for interesting people with interesting, who've 
[01:42:30]  done interesting things with interesting things to say and send them someplace, you know, really  cool that they felt really strong about, strongly about or, or had roots there.  Roots there themselves.  But they had not necessarily gone there in the past?  Uh, if it's a situation in almost every case they've been there before or it's a place  they were just dying to go to.  Right.  It was a, you know, sort of a personal obsession.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or are you just producing it?  Yeah.  Just producing it.  Very cool.  Oh, nice.  Look at that.  Producer hat.  Slap that credit on the screen and send me the check. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  Another season of Mind of a Chef.  Uh, that's for PBS.  Producing that as well.  Uh, this year it's Sean Brock and April Bloomfield.  Yeah.  And it was David Chang.  And, um, speaking of the Korean dudes named David, I saw your podcast with, uh, Dave,  my friend, David Cho.  Oh, Dave Cho.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I'd love to have him on.  He would be fun. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  He's a really cool guy.  What's he about?  I don't even know him.  He's, uh, he's, he's most known for his, his Facebook, his genius face.  He's the highest paid artist in history because he did Facebook sell wall for stock or  whatever.  Okay.  And when it translated, when it, when it, when it, when it cashed in, it was like over 200  million.  That's a nice.  Yeah.  Basically he was showing, I think in like, you know, beauty parlors and, uh, you know,  shoe stores in the neighborhood.  I mean, he was a successful graffiti artist, street artist, and very successful degenerate  gambler.  Uh, but I mean, I think he, they, they asked him if he'd do some artwork for Facebook and 
[01:44:00]  he said, yeah, 50 grand.  And they said, Oh, we're a, we're a little startup.  We can't afford that kind of money.  How about we pay you in stock?  And I think he cashed out, you know, north of 200 million.  Yeah.  But I would, I would, I would paint my face with Tommy Morrison's dick.  Now he wasn't the guy that was featured in, um, Korean town.  Yeah.  Okay.  I do know him.  He's a good podcast.  Was he the guy that painted your avatar for us? 
[01:44:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Great artist.  He was, he's a cool dude, man.  Yeah.  He did Patrice's cover.  He just did.  Uh, yeah.  Oh my God.  Of course I know this guy.  And that was another great episode.  Really great.  Looking into Korean town out there in LA and what they've been through.  Holy crap.  I had no idea.  Very bright.  Very funny.  Very tortured.  Uh, brilliant guy.  You know, the girl he does the pot.  I'm sorry.  Oh, she's an ex porn girl.  And I know she's still active.  She is fucking funny and sexy, man.  She's great. 
[01:45:00]  So I'm gonna have to check that out.  It's really, it's good.  He doesn't need the money.  He just loves doing it.  Yeah.  You talk about gambler that, that right there is like, Oh, I'll gamble and take a little  stock instead of money.  And that's like the hit of a lifetime.  Well, he's, he's post gambling rehab, but I mean, he's a guy he's, he'd bet like 50  grand on, on the coin toss.  Oh boy.  50 grand on what color of, uh, of Gatorades coming out of the, you know, they're pouring  on the coach.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Not a healthy gambler.  Yeah.  No. 
[01:45:30]  That's a great story.  And when you got that much money, it's like, you're lucky you got it out of your system  before you blew through everything.  But I mean, I just saw him, uh, a few weeks ago, he, he, he hitchhiked across America  with his, uh, with his buddy, uh, shooting it with a, you know, little, little handicap.  Um, he, he rides trains, you know, like hobo style.  Right.  Right.  Wow.  Um, he vacations at places like Afghanistan and the Congo.  Um, not your usual rich guy by a long shot.  He just went to Mexico right after we did the podcast.  He went down there for, it's kind of crazy to show some, yeah, man. 
[01:46:00]  It's like, do you got to enjoy your money and not change who you are?  But you got to be careful too.  There's a certain line you got to draw.  Like, all right, there's a reality here.  Kidnapper love to get their hands on him down there in Mexico.  I am.  Hopefully he's back now, but yeah, he's back.  He had a big, uh, exhibit down there, but great, great guy.  He'd be great.

It's the worst of the week countdown where we highlight everything good that happened on the show this week. 
[01:50:30]  And there was a lot this week.  Still to come, Pat and Oswald.  But first, there's an episode of Happy Days, season one, that centered primarily around race.  Now, how they dealt with race in the 70s pretending to be the 50s was a little different than how we deal with race today.  And as a show, we came together and we watched and analyzed what we saw on this episode.  And we did so quite hilariously, if I do say so myself. 
[01:51:00]  It's Happy Days and the best man episode here on the countdown.  Number two.  Number two.  I saw that Happy Days episode again the other morning where they have the wedding, the black wedding over at the Cunningham's house.  And because it's one of Mr. C's army buddies and he's a black guy and he's getting married.  So Mr. C brings him over and they come into the kitchen and Mrs. C was putting away the groceries and she picks up a watermelon and put it in the refrigerator right when they walk in. 
[01:51:30]  And she's like, oh, pleasure to meet you all because I guess she didn't know he was black or and and she's like, oh, oh, we we always have watermelon here.  Like she just made the instant like watermelon joke.  You couldn't do that joke on TV.  No, you wouldn't even think like Happy Days.  Happy Days.  You know, this this milk toasty, wholesome show for even for the time would even address that issue.  But could you find that, Sam?  Oh, they had a cop.  A cop brought the black guy to the Cunningham's door and he goes, he's trying to tell me he's staying here. 
[01:52:00]  No.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was all just fucking.  You would think as the years go by, we would become cooler as a society.  Right.  Just not.  It was one of the ones where that was on film and wasn't before a live audience.  And Fonzie was wearing the the fucking windbreaker.  Right.  He had a small part.  He was helping load chairs into the house.  He barely talked back then.  He's like, yeah, but I knew black guy.  And Richie goes, I don't think they like being called black Fonz.  I think they like being called Negroes.  And then Fonz is like, yeah, I don't care. 
[01:52:30]  You know, hey, I'd rather hang out with a cool black guy than an uncool white guy.  Oh, well, and then he left.  Do we have any clips of this?  No.  No.  Really?  Happy Days.  Black Wedding.  Black Wedding.  Black Wedding.  I remember the Mad Magazine did Hammy Days.  Happy Days.  Yeah.  Mad Magazine rule.  Yeah.  The best man.  That was the one.  Sunday, Monday.  Is this the whole episode?  If we don't hear the song, we're criminals.  Well, that was the original one.  They never played the Happy Days song. 
[01:53:00]  They never played the Happy Days song.  It was one, two, three o'clock.  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to be talking to Richie Cunningham on Monday.  Here it is.  Well, that gives me an excuse to buy the drinks.  We are.  For real.  The Watermelon.  Ron Howard on the show Monday.  Hi.  Oh, hi, Dad.  I'm going to meet my old army buddy, Fred Washington, my wife, Mary, and my son, Richard.  How do you do?  Oh, it's nice to meet you, Fred.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  Hi.  Oh, this is a surprise.  Uh, I mean, I didn't know that you, I mean, we didn't expect.  What I mean is, we have watermelon all the time. 
[01:53:30]  Here we go.  Joni, what are you doing?  Joni, what are you doing?  She's doing her invisible man imitation.  She's got a white hat.  Joni, please take it off.  Joni, please take it off.  It's cute, but white hoods make me nervous.  You can open your lap and give the glasses back to Fred.  You know, Fred's traveled all over the world.  Maybe there's some questions you like that.  Pause.  That really was shoehorned in, too.  It was.  That was so shoehorned in to do a KKK. 
[01:54:00]  There's no reason for her to have a fucking white fucking thing on her.  He's doing her invisible man impression.  That was some horrible writing.  That was so shoehorned so they could do the KKK line.  They just wanted to do a Klan joke.  Right.  Like, she could have come in the room or something.  They could have set it up earlier.  She's just sitting there.  She's just sitting there.  That never happened before or since.  Yeah, yeah.  These shows, it's fucking, you know.  Wow.  Back during this time.  Good times also, you know.  As good times went on, they kind of laid off of that thing.  But early on... 
[01:54:30]  They were all in?  Oh, they were all in with that.  Like, at one point, I saw one where James, this uppity, uppity black couple walks into  their house and looks around and didn't approve and everything.  And didn't approve of J.J. dating their daughter.  And James looks at Florida and just goes, oh, didn't you hear Florida?  There's niggas here.  Like, yeah.  It was just like, fuck, are they just throwing it around?  Wow.  You see, it's amazing that now, everybody at all costs avoids any mention of racism at 
[01:55:00]  all on television.  Right.  And then, they went out of their way.  Like, there was like, we have to add a KKK joke in here.  Yes.  There's no context.  It's a complete episode about race.  Right.  That isn't this, like, crazy PC thing.  It's just...  Let's see more clips from the show.  Because this stuff was written by people who lived and didn't grow up watching television.  Right.  These are people that had real human interactions.  Uh-huh.  They weren't a bunch of little fucking pussy boys.  Yeah.  Who just grew up hearing and watching things and not experiencing anything. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Like, they weren't just writing sitcoms based on older sitcoms.  They were writing sitcoms based on real moments or real interactions or, you know.  Yeah.  It's like, okay, the watermelon joke.  Put a Klan joke in there.  Why not?  Tom Bosley has some goddamn good hair.  When did Joanie ever do an invisible man impression?  No.  Never.  Before.  Never.  Just sitting there like that.  As fodder.  As fodder.  Just warming up the dinner table.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:56:00]  Let's see.  Tom Bosley.  What a great find out.  Yeah.  I love this one.  I forgot all about that.  See, we're all a little nervous here tonight.  And I'm nervous too.  Ah.  It's been a long time since I sat down and had dinner with white people.  Yeah.  Well, we understand.  Yes, we do.  Just try to forget we're white.  Cam Blatt.  When you look at these photos, I just can't believe that's how we look 12 years ago.  Well, I can believe it.  I must have put on over five pounds since those days.  You don't have to rub it in. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Hey, look at this one.  Me with that cute little nurse Sally.  Do you remember her?  How can I forget?  You used to ring her so often we nicknamed you the Phantom Buzzer.  Oh, what?  She was really something else.  You know, I remember the time.  The Phantom Buzzer?  Yo, it's the Phantom Buzzer.  The Phantom Buzzer.  That wouldn't even...  He'd be like, what?  No, yeah.  No, what you called me was the Faggot Buzzard.  Because you caught me bobbing my head up and down in a guy's lap like a bird. 
[01:57:00]  Tugging on his worm with my mouth.  That was the Faggot Buzzard.  Oh, shit.  Let's see what Miss C has to say.  Let's see what Miss C has to say.  With her Shakespeare shirt.  Yeah.  I want to be a pirate.  Yeah, Fred and I were just reminiscing about how we met in the hospital.  Who is that pretty girl standing next to you?  Oh, she's just some nurse.  You know, Mary, Fred thought I was in the hospital because I got wounded by a grenade.  And he didn't tell me until we were leaving that he dropped a box of grenades on his foot. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Who'd you say that pretty nurse was?  Just some nurse, Mary, and I don't remember her name.  So, the old bachelor's finally taking the plunge.  Here we go.  I just can't believe it.  Yeah, neither can I.  Well, there's that nurse again.  You're both in bathing suits.  All right, with the nurse.  Yeah, well, she was giving us some therapy.  Oh, and there she is again, alone.  I think we're finished with the scrapbook, Mary.  Pause.  Why don't you just say, I dated her before you, Mary, and that's why she's in a book that's in our home. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Why is it a problem?  It's during the war.  Yeah.  Right.  It was before you.  I was shooting at slanty-eyed people.  So, I had to come somewhere, didn't I, Mary?  Well, if it was 12 years ago.  Leave me the fuck alone, Mary.  Leave me the fuck alone, Mary.  I know.  Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.  Yeah, you're right.  Then they were married.  What Japanese?  Oh, wait.  He said...  12 years ago.  I can't believe it was 12 years ago.  Richie's older than 12.  Oh, God, that's a great point.  Oh, so they were married, and he was fucking around with the nurse?  That's a math mistake, by the way. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, they fucked up.  That's right.  That's a math mistake.  Maybe it was Korea?  No.  No, they definitely fucked up, yeah.  Yeah.  Or you just forgot something.  You got a side bitch.  Yeah, but that's...  You're right.  That's okay.  Mr. Cunningham had a little side piece.  Yeah.  There's no sexting.  He had to get his release somewhere.  Yeah.  That's true.  What was I supposed to do, Mary?  Come in another man's mouth like in Biloxi Blues?  Oh, Howard, I knew you'd like that.  I smelled the handles of the hammers in the hardware store. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  What are you so nervous about?  Mmm, the wedding.  One other thing.  What's that?  Howard, you and I have been friends a long time.  And I don't know anybody else in this town.  So...  Oh, boy.  How about it?  What about what?  You want to have a stag party?  A stag party?  Would you be my best man?  Hmm.  You want me to be your best man?  Yeah, of course he will.  Well, I'll understand if you have any reservations.  Oh, no, no, Fred.  I'd be proud to be your best man.  If you weren't...  Ha, ha, ha!  You understand that you might be the only white couple at the wedding?  Now, we have a lot of time. 
[01:59:30]  It's been a long time.  I've been a long time.  And I don't know anybody else in this town.  So...  Oh, boy.  How about it?  How about it?  What about what?  You want to have a stag party?  A stag party?  Would you be my best man?  Hmm.  You want me to be your best man?  Yeah, of course he will.  Well, I'll understand if you have any reservations about it.  The only one?  I'll hide my wallet.  Carol's family doesn't have many friends on this side of town.  But if it's going to make you uncomfortable, I'll understand if you don't want to come. 
[02:00:00]  Not come? Why don't we silly? I'm looking forward to it.  In fact, I was just going upstairs to fix my dress.  Cuck out, Howard.  Would you mind, by the way, if Howard prepped you with his mouth?  Howard likes to prepare a bowl by moistening his penis with his mouth.  I also like to clean up afterwards.  Yes, exactly.  Like, you dump your seed in her, she's unprotected,  and I'll suck it out before it has time to make that journey to her womb. 
[02:00:30]  It's a little game of catch me if you can.  What a fucking weird episode.  It really is.  Why the fuck doesn't the guy have white friends?  I don't know.  Because Carol doesn't have many friends.  His wife's name is Carol.  She doesn't have a lot of friends on that side of town.  It's way back when.  In the 50s.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  Now she's running upstairs to fucking lock up the jewelry.  Some more racism, I think, coming up. 
[02:01:00]  Play it, Sam, or you're fired.  Sam, what happened?  You wrecked it.  You think Tim Sabian will finally fix our computer, too?  Yes.  Maybe.  I hope so.  That'll be nice.  That plays, right?  I did.  Sam, please.  Oh, what happened to the computer?  Sammy!  Everyone decide to watch the same fucking YouTube channel?  Would you like some more coffee?  Oh, I'll get it.  Do you want a cup?  No, thanks.  Stop yourself.  Cream is in the refrigerator.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I see. 
[02:01:30]  Uh-oh.  Perfect timing.  Now he's in the kitchen alone.  Uh-oh.  And look.  Oh, hello, Mrs. Finley.  Hello, Mrs. Finley.  Hello, Mrs. Finley.  Mrs. Finley.  I'm sorry to bother you, but...  But I saw a negro in the yard.  I was talking to my mother last night, and Mr. Finley ripped the phone right off the wall.  Oh, I'll use the one in the kitchen.  Hold on, can you pause that?  Yeah.  Let's talk about the Finleys and how they should have their own show.  This cut was jibber-jabbering with her mother and her fucking husband. 
[02:02:00]  Ripped the phone off the wall.  I would watch that.  That's all I want to hear.  He ripped it.  You know it didn't end there.  No, not at all.  Oh, she gets beaten.  Yes.  Mr. Finley, you know how he is.  He wrapped the cord around my throat and dragged me up to the bedroom and stuck it where the  shit comes out.  But the whole neighborhood understands the relationship.  Oh, no.  No one calls the cops because...  Oh, it's just the Finleys.  Oh, his wife's jibber-jabbering again.  He's ripped another one out of the wall. 
[02:02:30]  He's fucking choking like De Niro choking Maury.  Today!  You gonna talk to Mr. Finley like that?  Fuck him.  Fuck that watermelon hijacking Mick.  All right, she goes and now she's going to the kitchen.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Racist Mrs. Finley.  Oh, she sees him at the fridge and freaks out.  Now she gets back at us.  Now she's out of the fridge.  She just screamed.  Yeah.  The audience, what's it like?  They pipe in some laughs. 
[02:03:00]  Like, that's hilarious.  Yeah, that's hilarious.  That the old white lady thinks the black guy is stealing shit.  But they had a figure like...  That's great.  How much canned laughter should we speckle in there?  Yeah.  It's just...  We gotta be careful.  It can't be a big guffaw.  It can't be a...  But when acknowledged, it can't be there.  It's not bad.  Yes.  It has to be a little...  So it's just a...  Titter.  Oh, I see.  A little titter.  Excuse me, Mr. Cunningham, but I couldn't help noticing that there's a man in the kitchen.  Oh, yes, that's Fred. 
[02:03:30]  He's staying here.  Would you like to meet him?  Meet him?  Oh, I don't think that's...  Fred, say hello to one of our neighbors, Mrs. Finley.  Oh, how do you do, Mr. Cunningham?  This is Fred Washington.  How do you do?  Oh, boy, she's nervous.  Oh, I always contribute to African missions.  Oh, so do I.  Uh, Fred's marrying a hometown girl here on Sunday.  Oh, that's nice.  Are you planning to live around here? 
[02:04:00]  Mrs. Finley rules.  Mrs. Finley.  Hey, oh, Mrs. Cunningham just came over.  You're not going to move into my neighborhood, are you?  I'm spying with it, with my fucking, with my hovercraft on a chair.  Amazing.  You're not planning on...  You can't fucking put this on TV today.  No.  Mrs. Finley rules.  Oh, that's great.  Because she knows.  She delivered that line perfectly.  It's not her she's worried about. 
[02:04:30]  Yes.  It's her husband.  Mr. Finley.  She doesn't want to have to go home and tell Mr. Finley that one of those fucking people  are moving close by, because he'll take it out on her.  And the next time there's an argument, she knows that Mr. Finley has a tendency to bellow  the word nigger when he's angry, and it's going to be ringing out through the windows.  Mr. Finley will rip the phone off the wall again and accuse her of bedding down with this  man.  Yes.  And we all know where that phone goes after it's ripped down off the wall.  Yes.  The fucking receiver cracks the back of her head and then is forced into her vagina and 
[02:05:00]  anus at the same time.  That's what he takes it, and he goes, why don't you call your boyfriend?  And he puts the earpiece in her asshole and the mouthpiece in her pussy.  And he picks her up like luggage.  And then he swings her through the bay window, throws her into the juniper bushes.  Not the juniper bushes.  He sexually assaults and beats Mrs. Finley savagely. 
[02:05:30]  He is a problem, Mr. Finley.  Mr. Finley.  She was just talking to her mother.  She was calling her mother for help.  Yes.  Can I stay with you?  He's drinking again.  Who the fuck are you talking to?  1950s drunk Irish Mr. Finley.  Exactly.  He just came home.  He was talking to his friend Captain McCluskey.  Okay, stand him up.  Ryan, I thought I were out of all you guinea hoods up.  I'm talking to Chuck Finley.  Let's see how this goes to Mrs. Finley. 
[02:06:00]  Sure.  Thank you.  Oh, but I did see a house on the block that I might buy.  This block?  Well, isn't that nice?  You'd be neighbors.  Oh, neighbors.  Well, you wouldn't mind living on the same block with a head shrinker, would you?  Are you a psychiatrist?  Oh, no.  I collect heads and actually shrink them.  Savage joke. 
[02:06:30]  Craft handed down to me by my great uncle, Nat King Conga.  Nat King Conga.  Well, I have to leave you.  Nat King Conga?  What about your call call?  No, no, no.  That's all right.  I'll write a little bit.  Was it not Nat King Conga?  He said, my great uncle, Nat King Conga.  Jesus Christ, or the other one, Mighty Joe Younga.  Holy shit.  Yeah, they really did go all out on this one.  And then I just get fired for Nappy Head at home.  Nat King Conga.  This country's insane. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Diamond should have brought up what Fred said.  Uh-huh.  This shit was acceptable back in, what, the 80s, I guess.  This was the 80s, late 70s?  This was 70s.  Yeah, this is first 80s.  This wasn't even late 70s.  This is 73, maybe?  This is early to mid-70s.  I think Happy Days made it to around 80, 81, right?  Yeah.  But they weren't doing anything like that at the end.  This was definitely early 70s.  Yeah, early.  Early.  Probably 72, 73.  Yeah, however many seasons it went, because this is the end of season one.  Oh, it is.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's why Chuck went. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Somewhere.  So this is about 40 years ago.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  Seems like it, right?  73 would be 40?  Jeez.  That's crazy.  Let's continue.  This is great.  Great find.  That wasn't very nice of us.  It sure wasn't.  Let's do it again sometime.  That's a white guy and a black guy getting along.  Yeah, but it's funny.  That wasn't very nice of us to pretend that you were going to live here. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  That's what it was.  That wasn't very nice.  All right.  Let's continue.  Fuck it.  What's next?  Yeah.  This is wonderful.  Let's see what...  They're going to bed.  You know, this is the fifth time I've been asked to be a best man.  Do they sleep in the same bed?  Yeah.  Maybe I should be on What's My Line?  I think it was nice of Fred to ask you.  Yeah.  They do.  I think so, too.  That's where the magic happens.  I suppose, though, they have a point that we might be conspicuous at the wedding. 
[02:08:30]  Uh-oh.  Marion, you don't want us to go to the wedding, do you?  I didn't say that.  You didn't have to.  Your prejudice is coming through loud and clear.  Oh, sure.  Howard, I'm not prejudiced.  Am I prejudiced?  It's hard to tell.  All that talk about feeling out of place, that's just an excuse, Marion.  Just an excuse for bigotry.  No, it's not, Howard.  I've watched World Star Hip Hop.  They beat white people up.  I've seen that. 
[02:09:00]  But I love how they're putting her in the play.  I love how they're giving the social message of some people don't even realize their prejudice.  Yes.  There's a message here, people.  Of course there is.  It is that no real man goes to bed wearing pinkish pajamas.  Isn't it amazing?  That's how they dress the white guy up in their fucking pinkish pajamas, scolding his naughty,  racist wife.  Yes.  Oh, what a cuckold he is.  You know, Marion, you don't seem to mind it when you're squatting over my face and one  of them is stretching you.  Stretching? 
[02:09:30]  That's different, Howard.  I've had three children, only two of whom will survive this series.  Sometimes I can't feel it when you put it in.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's what he does to show that, you know, he doesn't mind.  Yeah, right.  He's not racist.  He lets his friend come up.  Sure.  And fuck Mrs. C.  Yeah, and she rubs her clit on his mouth while her vagina is being filled.  And stretched.  He knows all the terms.  It's stretched.  It's just creative.  It's just being creative, are you? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, what do we got?  Well, there's a little message between the laughter here.  Let's hear the message.  All right.  Problem.  Let's face it, you don't want us to go to the wedding because we're white and they're  black.  You said enough, Howard.  Good night.  Bet you wouldn't tell that pretty little nurse that she's a bigot.  Oh, man.  Marion, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.  You did. 
[02:10:30]  I just didn't realize I was married to a racist uptight cunt.  Now, the nurse, we would make the letter H with her, Marion.  Of course, of course, my friend would take the back because she said the larger cock always  gets priority.  I'd be stuck in her mouth as an afterthought.  How many cuckold jokes can one mediocre comedian do?  That's great.  I think I really am prejudiced. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, boy.  Thank you, Howard.  Oh, boy.  She's going to figure it out by the end, though.  Don't mention it.  Thank you.  I've never had an argument like that with a girlfriend.  Never.  Right.  It never ends that easily.  She gets mad.  Good night.  Shuts the light.  And then she's like, oh, boy, you're right.  That was the 50s.  She'll fucking.  Yeah.  She doesn't want to get the same reaction that fucking the neighbor got.  Oh, Mrs. Finley.  She sees the black eyes.  Yeah.  Mrs. Finley just said something like he probably said, you know, we're going to go lynch one 
[02:11:30]  tomorrow.  And Mrs. Finley probably just said, oh, I don't know.  Should you?  And then he started.  He got to fucking just beat her half to death.  That's how it happens in the Finley's house.  Just an element a little different.  Yeah.  Not obeying him.  Exactly.  He kicks her out of bed with his slippers, his fucking chewed up slippers.  The old luggage maker.  Yeah.  The old luggage maker.  You can sleep on the floor with the dog.  Yeah.  He's fucking punching her in the face, full fist.  Every lamp has no shade on it because he's throwing them all across the room.  Damage them.  Once she's yip yapping with her mother like a little dog. 
[02:12:00]  Shut up, you cunt.  I'm listening to the radio.  They had a TV, of course.  But old Mrs. Finley's head went through at once.  20 spackle marks all over the wall from where his fist went through and her head.  They tried to do an offshoot with the Finley's called Not So Happy Days.  Happy Days, Sad Nights.  Slappy Days.  He just smacks her out all day.  Sunday, Monday, Slappy Day. 
[02:12:30]  There's a lot of reading between the lines that has to go on in these episodes.  Absolutely.  There's a lot of subtext here.  Yes.  Let's continue.  It's very subtle.  Thank you, Howard.  I'm going with Fred to discuss the wedding plans at his father-in-law's office.  He needs my support.  What does his father-in-law do?  He's an undertaker.  I never met an undertaker.  Never met a Negro.  Never met an undertaker. 
[02:13:00]  Howard, I've got to get out of the house more.  Oh, boy.  You should give her a Dutch oven right there.  Fucking.  A putrid soul food fart.  A 50s high fat content.  Fucking wet fart.  Yeah.  And then pulls the cover over her head.  There you go, you prejudiced bitch.  Four cups of coffee with cream.  Yeah.  And a lot of butter.  A Dutch oven.  Can you imagine screening that for executives? 
[02:13:30]  That scene is exactly the same.  Yeah.  It ends with a Dutch oven.  Howard cuts a gasser.  That Howard pulls the cover over her head.  Oh, Howard.  Oh, big stinky one.  She's just dry heaving under the cover.  That's like a commercial.  I love that.  Do it to one.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  Now it looks like they're at the undertaker.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Now he's meeting the other side of the family there.  Smoking a cigar.  Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Cunningham.  Oh, you too, Mr. Davis.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's talk about the wedding plans.  Cannibal burst.  Oh, I'll wait in the other room.  That's the embalming room.  Not again.  Maybe I'll wait right here.  Oh, what a lovely ashtray.  Oh, that's Mr. Turner.  I've seen better ashtrays.  Okay, Mr. Davis, let's get down to the wedding plans. 
[02:14:30]  Good idea.  But first, he can't be the best man.  Why?  What do you got against Howard being the best man?  Nothing really.  It's that he's not quite the color I had in mine.  I have nothing against white.  I treat everyone the same.  I'm glad to hear that.  And when they come to me, I don't look at the color.  I just put them in a box.  That is the American way.  Look, Carol and I wanted a small wedding, and you decided on a big church affair.  Easy.  You even tried to pick my best man.  Now, look, let me tell you something. 
[02:15:00]  This is going to end in a shooting.  Your wedding plans are canceled.  I'm taking over the arrangements.  You?  You're not going to have one of those cheap weddings, are you?  It's going to be a nice wedding.  And I'm going to do it my way.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, world star.  World star.  Oh, well, goodbye, sir.  You have a nice place here, and I'm going to recommend it to my friends.  You missed a spot right there.  See?  He could be prejudiced, too.  Yeah, but why would you say goodbye, sir, when the guy just basically insulted him?  Yes.  Of course.  I would never say goodbye to that guy.  No.  I'd tip the body over and make him clean it up. 
[02:15:30]  I'd yell, and I'm like, fucking, Carl yelled at Connie,  Now, clean it up!  You have to pick up Mr. Turner.  Who was that guy, though?  He was the bride's father.  Oh, that is the bride's father.  Mr. Carol Davis.  More conflict.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of conflict in this episode.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no.  I'll have to check a few other places before I decide.  Yes.  Bye.  I have a catering hall, I think.  How's it going? 
[02:16:00]  I can't believe it.  You ever said that right?  I can't find any place to hold a wedding.  Probably.  I mean, either all of the halls are booked, or it's out of my price range, or out of my  race range.  Wow.  Can we acknowledge that Joni has nothing to do with this episode?  Not a thing.  She's sitting on an ottoman, playing with one of those paddle ball elastic things.  Right.  Yeah.  Doesn't even have to be in the show.  I wonder if she was crazy back then.  Yeah.  Could you imagine letting that family know, who in this room is going to become homeless?  Right.  Crazy homeless, they would all, you know, pick the black guy.  Yeah, you've got to pick the black guy. 
[02:16:30]  But it turns out to be the old Joni.  The old Joni, yep.  Who seems to be a problem in her town.  Terrible.  They're in the world's smallest living room.  Right.  Yes, that is a very tiny little living room.  The chairs are very close together.  Yeah.  I think it's time for Richie to have a thing to say.  Richie's got to say something.  Yeah.  All right, let's see what Richie has to say.  Yeah.  Joni, would you please stop that?  We're trying to solve a problem.  Okay.  She solves it.  Oh, you think?  Can I make a suggestion?  You can have the wedding right here in this house. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Here?  It's a terrific idea.  We could have it in the living room.  Oh, boy.  In this tiny living room?  Yeah.  In this shitty living room.  Mark can play the piano.  Here comes the bride as easy.  Have it here.  And for the reception, I'll make some delicious cheese dips and hors d'oeuvres.  Cheese dips.  I've made a marvelous recipe in a column called...  What a shitty wedding.  This is going to be very...  Elizabeth Taylor made it for Eddie Fisher on their honeymoon.  That's right.  This is before she got cancer and wore that awful wig and then sided with Michael Jackson 
[02:17:30]  when everybody thought he was raping children.  This is when she was still beautiful and playing roles that should have been given to black women.  But, you know, it's the 50s.  Who would want their wedding in this shitty...  It was a recipe that Elizabeth Taylor made for Richard Burton before he shoved a wine bottle in her cunt and stepped on it.  Her cooking her Midwestern white housewife shit for these black people. 
[02:18:00]  Black people have probably a nice and a fucking fun diet and she's going to go a white lady cheese dip.  Oh, God, awful.  Cheese dip for a wedding reception?  Yeah, yeah.  Awful, is that?  Terrible.  I can't wait to see a house full of black people now.  I'll be fighting over the toilet.  Who has to take a liquidy cheese dip shit first?  He'll be shitting in Joanie's hamper.  They're going to have to flea bomb the place after the wedding. 
[02:18:30]  Shitting in her hamper.  They'll remove all their prejudices and then the house will be completely pillaged after the wedding.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Not one item left.  Absolutely.  Yeah, exactly.  Joanie would be fucking crying in her bed with her fucking blood in her underpants.  Jesus!  What the fuck?  What happened?  I just pillaged.  Well, you know my friend's drunk cousin, Sly, who came over?  Who just got out of jail for drinking under the influence or driving under the influence. 
[02:19:00]  Drinking under the influence.  Exactly, drinking under the influence.  That's how drunk he was.  Did it twice.  Snuck up into Joanie's room.  Ah, that's great.  Yeah.  Horrible.  All right, let's see what happens here.  She put her fucking fingers that smelled like cool cigarettes over her nose and bloody  their underpants.  That's how this episode airs.  It's a pro-racism show.  You're like, this is what happens when you're friends with them. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, fuck.  The more you know.  No, it was Liz.  Marion.  Yes, dear, I'm finished anyway.  Marion, I appreciate your offer, but think about what you're in for.  You're going to have a house full of people.  Negro people.  Oh, boy.  And I say that that doesn't happen every day in this neighborhood.  I'd say it doesn't happen every hundred years in this part of town.  You're one rich in yours.  And you're going to get funny looks from your neighbors, and maybe more than just funny  looks.  Besides, you've got to live here, not me. 
[02:20:00]  Thank God.  Will you give me that, Richard?  I said no paddle ball.  We're having an important discussion.  Howard, would you run it through your head?  Why would he start?  I don't know.  Now why is he going to start paddling?  He's 37.  Why is he paddling?  Why isn't he in this conversation?  There's so much weird shoehorning.  There's no more conversation.  Why would he ever do that?  Richie started paddle balling.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  No.  Unless this ties in later.  And then...  Well, no. 
[02:20:30]  Mr. C is going to be so nervous, he's going to start paddle boarding.  There you go.  Have you guys seen my Invisible Man impression?  It's going to be his way to show that he's now a little nervous about the prospect of having  the wedding in town.  Yeah, the guy will say something that makes him nervous.  And then he'll start paddle boarding.  Oh, Joni's doing her Hitler impression.  Oh, look, it's a little chocolate under my nose.  All the Weinsteins and her Jewish friends hide.  Oh, no, it's just my chocolate under the nose impression.  Give me your answer in the morning, okay? 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  And if your answer is no, I'll understand.  Believe me, I'll understand.  But please think about it first.  Say, you're right.  Please, Richard.  I thank you.  Oh, call back.  What a horrible little, like, string of continuity.  But it's a terribly written episode.  But who knew Bosley was good at the paddle board?  He did.  That's how I mean.  They saw him doing it on set one time.  They're like, how can we incorporate that?  Yes.  He requested it to be written into the race episode. 
[02:21:30]  He fucking plays her in a bed.  Mrs. C gets up on all fours and props her ass up.  And he just tries to lick her bunghole with the ball.  Just tap it.  It's like cherry darts by himself.  Yes.  And sometimes when he's mad at her, he'll dip it in hot sauce.  It's like cherry darts with a ball return.  Yeah.  He can just dunk, dunk, dunk.  And then a little fucking hot sauce goes.  Yeah.  And then she goes, oh, Howard.  And she goes forward and her head smashes the headboard.  Nice flat beehive hairdo. 
[02:22:00]  Let's see.  Let's see.  Come on.  I think we're good with this.  Yeah.  I like this.  Weird.  More pink shit.  This time you get up in the middle of the night, will you please put the blankets back  over me?  Sorry, Marion.  Oh, Howard, something's wrong.  Do you want to tell me about it?  Do you want to tell me about it?  You do this to me, Rock?  Late at night?  Well, one thing, you're wearing my robe.  The robe's on my side of the bed.  So are the blankets. 
[02:22:30]  Terrible jokes.  They're hard.  You're right, Marion.  Something is bothering me.  It's having Fred's wedding here.  I'm just not so sure it'll work out.  Why do you say that?  Well, I don't think I'm a bigot, Marion, but our neighbors, they're different.  You know, like that Mrs. Finley.  Oh, Mrs. Finley is a pain in the B-E-H-I-N-D.  That's not how you spell it.  I know.  I just don't think our neighbors are ready for this.  Pain in the ass. 
[02:23:00]  Well, I think we are.  Marion, don't you think that it was guilt that made you ask Fred to have the wedding?  Holy shit.  Well, maybe it was this time, but next time, it won't be.  Oh, no.  Here comes Richie.  Oh, dear, what are you doing up?  I'm losing my hair, Mom.  I just woke up. 
[02:23:30]  I thought there was a fucking wig on my pillow.  It was me.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he's already starting the fucking teenage comb over.  Exactly.  Look up the parts far down on his head.  Pretty far down.  Exactly.  I lost my hair, Mom.  Potsy was arrested in the rest area, Mom.  What are you doing up right now?  I lost my hair. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, fuck, man.  I'm going to think about that all day.  Oh, great timing.  He's rubbing his eyes all tired.  Can you go back up slightly to Richie's big entrance?  Oh, that is fucking funny, man.  Whoa.  Jesus, Sam.  Back up to episode four.  What are you doing?  Fucking burn you.  There you go.  Good enough.  Good enough.  All right.  There you go.  That'll work. 
[02:24:30]  Bruce, you're ready for this.  Weird camera work.  I think we are.  Isn't it?  Marion.  Our show is weird.  Don't you think that it was guilt that made you ask Fred to have the wedding here in the  first place?  Well, maybe it was this time, but next time it won't be.  It was the goo coming into my panties.  Oh, dear.  What are you doing up?  I heard you down here.  Is there something wrong?  Your mother and I were just having a private talk.  Why don't you go on back to bed?  Your father thinks the neighbors might object to our having this wedding. 
[02:25:00]  Why don't you have a glass of milk, Richard?  You know, the noise in the cars and all the people.  Well, nobody got upset when the Kindles had their 10th anniversary party.  Well, that's because they knew they were going to go on to invent something that helped  people read without lugging books around.  Kindles.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Well, if the Kindles could do it.  Yeah.  The Cunninghams can, right?  That's true.  Yeah.  I'm glad that you're not going to let our thick-headed neighbors push you around. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, just because all the people are going to be Negroes.  You are, huh?  I really am.  I spilled it.  You're a moron.  How do you spill milk out of a...  How do you not do another take?  I know.  They said, fuck it, leave it.  Where's my pedal board?  Someone that might spill the milk in that situation.  There's Negroes over his house.  He just spilled milk on the table.  There's nothing to do with anything.  It's just sitting there.  Yeah.  I think we got the Finleys coming back.  Or is it the Fonz? 
[02:26:00]  No.  Mr. Lee.  He found out that Richie spilled that milk.  He's going to smash him good.  He's going to fucking lay that big, thick 50s milk bottle over his head.  No, he wants to borrow it to beat his own wife.  Because he broke his across her head two days before.  I want to beat the back of her calves.  Oh, that Mr. Finley's a problem.  I love Mr. Finley.  Do we get to meet Mr. Finley?  I don't remember this episode.  I hope so.  I don't.  Actually, this middle part, I didn't see the other day.  I hope we meet Mr. Finley, because during the wedding, you hear a loud crash, and a small 
[02:26:30]  tree has been thrown through the bay window.  Racist note on it.  Yes.  Well, there could be a cross burning or something on the front lawn.  Okay.  I don't know.  I didn't see this part.  All right.  Let's see.  I'm assuming it's late at night, so it's probably some kind of a threat.  Well, I wonder who that can be.  It's probably Posse.  He always smells food coming from our kitchen.  Oh, no.  It's the top.  That's right.  Oh, Officer Kincaid.  All right.  What's this all about? 
[02:27:00]  Well, I'm the agent for the Partridge family, and I'd like to know why this Negro is in  front of your house.  Officer Kincaid is at the front door with Fred Washington.  Fred Washington.  Thank God that didn't rhyme.  Officer Kincaid, you brought up.  Why is Fred Washington still wearing his suit in the middle of the night?  It's the middle of the night.  He's in a suit.  He's got burglary tools and a fucking hard-on and a ladder outside of Johnny's bedroom. 
[02:27:30]  Zimmerman's grandfather's outside.  What's all about?  I caught him prowling the neighborhood.  I was taking a walk.  He told me he was staying here, but I've heard that one before.  I just wanted to let you know that your police force is on its toes.  Oh, boy.  It's more likely that they've got their foot in their mouth because he is staying here.  What?  He is staying here.  Oh, I didn't know.  I mean, well, he's a stranger.  You know what I mean? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, we all know what to be.  That guy looks like Bernie Gats.  I think you should know that he's not only Gats in our house, but that I am going to be  the best man at his wedding.  Why is he twiddling?  Wouldn't it be great if he pulled out his gun and shot Howard for that?  Crime against God.  No, you're not.  Oh, no, you're not.  I like the fact that he thought this guy was prowling, so he brings him up without cuffs to Howard's  door.  He could possibly menace his family.  Yeah, what the fuck?  They weren't brave enough to cuff him for the episode. 
[02:28:30]  It's so silly.  Oh, it really is.  It's like Fred not bringing a change of clothes with him when he stayed at the place.  Not at all.  And why is he going for a walk in the middle of the night with his suit still on?  Who does that?  His tie is still on.  Tight.  Tight, too.  They did that so there would be no question.  People wouldn't watch and go, well, you know, the comp should have looked at him.  Yeah, look how he's dressed.  You know, but so they made him meticulously dressed in a suit, but it's like it has to  be three in the morning, right?  They just were woken up from sound sleep while Fred's moseying around the neighborhood. 
[02:29:00]  Trying to take a peek at the neighbors.  Just peeking.  Just do all that peeking.  But someone's getting out of the shower.  How it's got an I am Fred fucking hoodie on after the cops mull him down.  Fifty-two shots.  Or they just give him the old Luima treatment.  Take Fred down and give him a good Abner Luima-ing.  That's horrible. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  Terrible.  Here in this house.  Gee, I didn't know.  Congratulations.  I love weddings.  Thanks, but this is just for our family.  Would you care to join us for a sandwich?  Oh, no, thanks.  I never eat on duty.  It dulls the senses.  And you must have just had a big dinner.  Whoa.  Howard.  Yeah.  Here's the fons.  All right.  Bring a chair in.  Yeah.  I'll tell you, whoever sits in this one but have a good sense of balance,  well, you're going to have a lawsuit on your hands.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Three-legged chair.  Well, listen, I'm sorry to bother you on a weekend like this,  but you're the only guy I knew.  Pause.  It's back to that shoehorning shit.  The chair is broken.  You would never bring it into a house.  Yeah, why would you carry that in instead of leaving it out  outside?  Why bring it in?  It's broke.  You'd look at this and say,  well, this chair is certainly not usable.  Why don't you put it right up front?  Or maybe there's three gay friends coming to the house.  Yes, that old guy.  Flip it on over.  Yo, Red, what happened to this chair?  Ah, Mr. Finley broke a leg off  and put his wife in the hospital back in March. 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  Old man Finley's chair.  Yeah.  He beat the back of his wife's arms  so she wouldn't bruise at work.  Wacky old Mr. Finley's at it again.  Yeah, old Mr. Finley.  Good old Mr. Finley.  Yeah.  He's a problem in the neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  He's just...  Mrs. Finley knows too well.  Yeah, Fonz is fucking dressed like fucking  Ahmadinejad in his stupid members-only jacket.  Yeah, he's got like a members-only jacket. 
[02:31:00]  He was...  But he didn't put on the real whole Fonz voice.  Right.  He kind of was a lot more reserved  and not as caricaturish.  They're all metal folding chairs  except for one wooden chair.  One wooden chair.  Obviously broken.  It doesn't make sense.  Just so they can make a dumb joke.  Absolutely.  Hey, maybe Paul McCartney's wife can sit here.  Get a hold of a truck.  Hey, don't worry about it, huh?  My boss ain't gonna miss the truck a couple hours.  Well, listen, I appreciate it anyway.  It's all right.  But your father owes me five bucks  along with your appreciation, right? 
[02:31:30]  Oh, right.  Of course.  So you're gonna have a bunch of black people in here, huh?  Well, Fonz is...  I don't think that they like being called black.  They're Negroes.  Hey, uh, I didn't mean anything by it, you know?  I mean, I'll take any guy as long as he's cool.  Right?  I'd rather know a cool black guy  than an uncool white guy and vice versa  if you get my drift.  Yeah, yeah.  I gotta go.  Okay, thanks a lot, Fonz. 
[02:32:00]  Pardon me, I'm Reverend Dawson.  Hey, that's cool.  I'm Fonzie.  Later.  He slapped his hand and then just walked out.  He gave me five.  By the way, Fonz...  And he flipped his hand over and said, you know, that side.  Fonz isn't packing.  No.  He was leaning way back in his chair  with his very tight jeans on  and barely a hint of a ball bag, even.  And then he describes something, like, pretty much verbatim  and follows it up with,  if you catch my drift. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  You catch my drift.  Yeah.  And then fucking Cunningham sits down and whispers,  even though they're the only two in the room.  Why are you whispering?  Well, you don't know if Mr. Finley's around.  Mr. Finley's always listening.  He's always listening.  Do you know...  He's got his ear to the pavement.  Now that, like, the word's out  that there's a black wedding at the Cunninghams,  do you know the shit Mr. Finley  has nonstop been saying to Mrs. Finley  and on the phone to other neighbors?  And I'll tell you what beatings  he's been administering to her. 
[02:33:00]  She actually was on the phone with her mother  and said, there's blood in my stool.  He's been punching me in the small of my back a lot.  Gave her internal bleeding.  You think old Mr. Finley's having a meeting or two?  Absolutely.  In some hall somewhere?  He's almost certainly going to firebomb this wedding.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's in a basement somewhere planning.  Oh, yes.  At a bar, he sits down.  He starts just muttering to himself.  That shit, stupid fucking Cunninghams.  Cunninghams.  I teach them a goddamn lesson. 
[02:33:30]  But then at the end, he's just like,  and I didn't come here  to have this kind of crap next to him.  Oh, just horrid.  It's fine.  Mr. Finley's trying to round up Clayton Townley  and the rest of the guys from Mississippi burning.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The worst of the week countdown  on the Opie and Anthony sound.

In L.A., I'm doing the Los Angeles Public Library is doing this celebration of Moby Dick. 
[02:39:30]  Wow, look at that.  You're all over.  So I'm doing three readings.  I'm just going to go to three different libraries and read sections from Moby Dick, which they've sent me these sections.  I mean, I've never read all of Moby Dick.  I'm going to admit it.  Oh, sorry.  That is a seriously fucked up book.  Yeah.  Some of the stuff that goes on in that book.  It's just pages and pages of just psychosis.  So I'm going to be reading some of the weirdest parts because I'm doing this whole thing.  Are you going to put on a dramatic reading voice? 
[02:40:00]  I think I'm going to put on, I'm going to try to, and then I'm going to get confused and angry because these passages are really, really weird.  I didn't know that Herman Melville was so damaged.  Yeah, twist, like a damaged guy.  How long is his passage?  Each, like a page and a half, like really quick.  And then I'll talk to the audience about like what the hell just happened.  Like, and there'll be people there that, you know, there's, there's already people like, cause I was announcing it on Twitter.  And then they're like, Hey, make sure to read this passage.  Cause then like, I've been looking some of them up and they're, they're really hard. 
[02:40:30]  There's some twisted shit in there.  Like this fucking captain and the cabin boy and shit.  But there's a lot of like, there's all this, there's all these references, or at least  they allude to the idea that he's gone to, he hates this whale so much that he's gone to  all these islands of different savages and he's storing these like Zoroastrians and these  crazy religious fanatics, but he keeps them stored like under the decks and they just sit  there smoking weed all day and going crazy.  And the minute the whale services, he's going to like, let these maniacs loose to go kill 
[02:41:00]  this thing.  So on the, on the, on the deck of the ship is Quee Quag and Ishmael and all these guys.  But then underneath of it, it's like the gathering of the juggalos and he's just giving them  all PCP and they're going to go throw them out like a cluster bomb of savages.  Exactly.  It's amazing.  I had no idea.  I've never read the book.  No, I haven't either.  I know nothing about Moby-Dish.  I think I might have to read that one.  That's cool.  I just hear the name and giggle.  I can't help it. 
[02:41:30]  Well, also what I didn't know about the book was Herman Melville was this hugely successful,  like killer dealer author of money, fame.  And then he spent all these years writing his great American, and it ruined him and he died  penniless and kind of crazy.  Yeah.  This thing just ate him alive and he wouldn't, and they put it out.  Everyone hated it.  Like all their views were like, this is the worst, most unreadable piece of shit.  Fuck.  This guy flushed his career down the toilet.  When did it become a classic? 
[02:42:00]  I think like 50 years after he was dead.  Wow.  Yeah, it was really weird.  It just kind of blew it.  Damn.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a guy, like imagine, like imagine, think of like Bruce Springsteen, and then all  of a sudden for the, he stops doing music for 10 years and then comes out with this weird  atonal, like he's just banging on like a weird, like a dixie cup with a mummified penis for  four hours.  And everyone's like, that's it?  He goes, this is all I'm doing from now on. 
[02:42:30]  They're like, God, he's gone.  And then he just ends up like dying in a men's hotel somewhere.  But then 50 years later, people dig that.  They're like, this is the greatest album ever.  Do you know the history of how it turned it around and how it became a classic?  That I don't, I still got to read that part because it's an amazing, it is a fascinating  story about a guy burning his leg on the ground and then that becomes a thing he's, and then  his big bestseller books no one gives a shit about.  Yeah, yeah.  That were bestsellers during his lifetime, no one reads anymore, no one cares.  When did he, what was his life and death years, roughly?  I see, I don't know that.  Did he die in the 1900s or the 1800s? 
[02:43:00]  I think he died in the late 1800s, but don't quote me.  Yeah, there you go.  Get on Wikipedia.  We're going to have to do that.  Yeah.  He's also, his other big, one of his big bestsellers was called UMO, O-O-M-O.  And if you do crossword puzzles, you see that a lot.  Yeah.  Just says, Melville novel.  Oh, this person needs vowels in his puzzle.  So here comes UMO.  Get no UMO because that's going to be the one in there.  Well, you got 1819 to 1891.  I didn't live the fuck in with you, 72. 
[02:43:30]  Almost made it.  72 years old, right?  Lived a long life, died miserable.  You're doing animation still?  Yeah, I do.  Well, you know, now I, because my daughter is four and we watch all these animated shows  and then sometimes I'll tweet about them like, I can't get the Doc McStuffins tune out of my head.  Of course.  And then they'll call me and go, hey, you want to do a voice in my kid?  All my, all of your favorite, like, 90s musicians are all doing kid shows now.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is, they might be giants. 
[02:44:00]  They do all the music.  Doc McStuffins is that girl from Letters to Cleo.  Oh, shit.  And she's like this big songwriter.  So it's like all of your alt-90 darlings.  That's where they went.  Oh, yeah.  They all went there.  They knew where, like, there's cash in that, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Like, they all, they don't have to tour.  They're happy.  It's got to be easy to write.  My son's go-to movie in the car is Ratatouille.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when I saw Patton, I'm like, can I just choke you, please?  I'm so sorry.  Because when these kids latch on to a movie, they will not let go for a long time. 
[02:44:30]  I will say, though, that that's a very smart kid that can watch Ratatouille at age three.  He loves it.  Although he makes us fast forward through the scary parts, the whole rainstorm in the beginning and stuff.  Well, just, yeah, yeah, because, and the shotgun, like, it's really dark.  Yeah, he knows when, you know, he's like, yeah, but he doesn't want to turn it off.  He goes, just fast forward for me.  Yeah, I want to see the rest of it.  That's crazy.  Just be happy that, because one of the things my daughter is into is that Dora the Explorer. 
[02:45:00]  That's okay.  Dora the Explorer?  You like Dora the Explorer?  How much do you like it?  One, two, three.  He knows.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  For us, it's Caillou.  Caillou's the whiny little, he's a whiny little fuck, and then I hear my son imitating Caillou.  I'm like, no, you're not going to imitate Caillou.  Yeah, and also, that's the only one I can't stand out of all the kids' programs. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, and she loves Caillou, and that little theme, that weird, I'm Caillou.  I've heard that, yeah.  Do you do animation voices, Jim?  Because you have an amazing voice for animation.  You should be doing voiceovers.  Thank you.  I wish there was somebody else in my career that felt that way.  A person of power or influence that was managing me.  Thank you.  When you guys were playing the early Jim Norton thing with that voice, it sounded like you  were doing a voice.  Yeah.  How we doing? 
[02:46:00]  Oh, I should have had my throat cut.  Ah, yeah.  That's back at, was that here?  We did it at NW.  It was just played over Best Of.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just played last week, I didn't.  It was amazing, yeah.  Who came in?  Patrice?  Fucking boss?  Yeah, they were all, it was like they brought in the Magnificent Seven of Ball Busters and  then found the most embarrassing thing.  Yes!  Like, it was the perfect storm of ball busting.  That's exactly it.  We've done a few of those over the years.  They're very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  We've played some of our old radio shows from the beginning. 
[02:46:30]  You don't get through, like, four words before somebody just jumps in and starts pounding  you up.  Whoa, what?  Yeah.  It's so brutal.  It's humiliating.  Jimmy's voice.  Mine was terrible.  Ah, yeah, people!  Oh, like me, like me, like me, like me.  What were you dressed in?  Like, how were you dressed?  What were you wearing?  It should have been a fucking suit with my hands over my chest and a sock pillow.  I was wearing fucking baggy purple, like, fucking workout pants. 
[02:47:00]  No!  Oh, dude, I was a cunt.  And a fucking black, like, mock turtle.  I was a complete...  Wow.  Just a zilch.  An absolute zero.  At the time, you thought you looked good, though.  Oh, my God, I sure did.  High energy, smiling.  You know, they're enjoying me.  Always create them with a smile and be totally inclusive.  I listened to them.  No one left out.  You know that like me shit?  You gotta be likable.  You gotta be likable.  When you first start, you hear that.  And, you know, you want the industry to like...  It's all this nonsense you buy into that, thank God, some of us get out of. 
[02:47:30]  Well, how much nonsense...  Remember when you would buy into the idea that if you fuck up at this club or anger this club,  in your mind, it's a network.  Right, right.  And they all talk to each other, and you'll be banned from all...  Right, yeah.  Like, suddenly you have a cabaret card, and it's 1961, and you're gonna be banned.  And then you realize later, oh, it would have actually helped my career if certain club owners  had hated me immediately.  Yeah.  Because it would have...  The word would have gotten out that, oh, this guy's actually good if this asshole doesn't  like him.  Yeah, if he hates him or, yeah, fuck him. 
[02:48:00]  There's no loyalty.  You could burn down the Cleveland improv and then still hire you in Baltimore.  Yeah, they don't give a shit.  They really don't.  So, yeah, there was always that, oh, so frustrating.  How do you know, like, when you're starting out like that, what to even wear?  Like, oh, I'm wearing these purple things.  Like, was it calculated?  Did you go into that closet and be like, tonight I'm on stage, let me get that.  Or did you just throw on what was clean?  A club owner gave me them.  This guy, Mark Vito, who runs Club Casbah, and Wallet Wallet gave me a couple of baggy pants.  I just thought they were kind of cool, and I would tuck my shirt in. 
[02:48:30]  Here's the one I wore during my fight with you, Rock.  Ugh.  Blue shorts.  Exactly.  I would always try to, like, wear the, I would always try to dress, like, in the subtle comedian uniform.  Yeah.  So it's, like, maybe, like, the suit jacket, but then the jeans, and then the bright sneakers.  Like, come on, he's a little, you don't know what's going to come out of this guy.  He's dressed for fun.  And then the T-shirt under the suit jacket with a weird, ironic logo on it, you know. 
[02:49:00]  Look, it's the Mr. Bubble logo.  I'm nuts.  We don't know what I'm going to do.  I mean, if I'm willing to put this on, what's going to happen?  Oh, Jesus.  It's so pathetic.  So needy.  There's nothing.  That's what's hard about watching you when you're yourself when you're young.  It's not that you're not funny.  It's that you're needy.  You're so needy.  It was both.  Yeah.  I was not funny, and I was needy.  That's that.  When we were going through old radio stuff, I was literally months out of doing construction. 
[02:49:30]  So I was just so happy.  But you get a pass.  I'm like, oh, my God.  So everything was so like, oh, yeah, yeah, over the top fun.  I was just so eager to, like anything, throw in an imitation.  I must perform.  Because the attic was waiting for you.  Yes, that attic was.  So you kind of have a pass.  He came out of nowhere.  This kid.  This kid.  This kid.  He came out of nowhere, though. 
[02:50:00]  But it is.  I'm not a kid on Vulcan.  And that's where he's going.  I started this shit when I was 18.  He's in his 30s.  Comes out of nowhere.  Fucking boom.  Oh, he's a boom.  You know what his advantage was, and yours, too, is because you started young, and you started  from with the past you had.  And you had this cliff of darkness behind you of there's nothing to fall back on.  So you've got to work twice.  It makes you work twice as hard when you have got nothing else. 
[02:50:30]  We both had nothing.  When I started doing stand-up, I kind of blew everything else.  Right.  And I realized I can't work in every office I got.  I worked in it.  Either people hated me or I hated it, and I had a terrible attitude.  Because it's so much like, I have a cliff to my back.  Yeah.  If I fall back, I will fall off the planet and be gone.  You're one of those people that, well, they fell through the cracks of society.  I literally, that's where I would have ended up.  I would have ended up somewhere.  Yeah.  All those guys almost made it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Because that's the other side of this.  Those guys that almost made it but had the cliff at their back, and they fucking fell. 
[02:51:00]  For whatever reason.  How many comedic geniuses do we know?  Truly visionary guys that just never, they're just gone.  Or they're still around, but what do you do?  They made bad decisions, a lot of them.  A lot of people wanted to just work.  The big road headliners of like 1992, I started in 1990.  Wow.  And a lot of those guys began in the 80s.  And they headlined before they were ready because the 80s had a fucking million clubs,  so everyone got the headline.  Oh, yeah.  And then they got bottlenecks squeezed out in the fucking early 90s, and they couldn't find work. 
[02:51:30]  And like those guys that would work in like 92, 93, they're gone now.  Yeah.  Because a lot of those rooms weren't around.  So also, they got used to a certain lifestyle of, I make this much money, I do this.  And the people that survived when the boom stopped, and there were people that did make it.  But those are the ones who are like, I got to get some other shitty job and keep doing stand-up until it comes around again.  Yeah, yeah.  And some people did do that.  But you're right.  There were some people that were like, you know, I used to headline at a, yeah, I used to headline at a club chain that does not exist. 
[02:52:00]  It doesn't even exist anymore.  No one cares.  Yeah, yeah.  And there were also those guys that, you know, they wrote their 45 minutes, and then they just, I'm done writing.  Yep, exactly.  I got my 45.  That's my life.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  My life's comic.  I don't understand those guys.  Why would I go on stage for no money?  You see, some of those guys come through, you know, once a year, and you go see them, you're like, what are you doing?  Same thing.  Same exact thing.  Isn't it fun?  I thought it was fun writing jokes.  That was the whole point of doing this.  You get to, you have to do the same shit over and over again. 
[02:52:30]  New stuff.  Yeah.  Those guys, I'm merciless with those guys.  They're fucking lazy.  Yeah.  Think you're fucking lazy.  Yeah.  Write a joke or try a joke.  You know, same fucking dog shit inflection for 10 years.  Oh, fuck you.  Fuck you.  On HBO, I think it's HBO Classic, Comedy, whatever the fuck it is, they play a lot of the old specials from the 80s and stuff.  And you see these guys, and you're like, oh, yeah, that guy.  And he had, like, a little fame back then. 
[02:53:00]  And you realize, you never saw this guy after, like, the boom of stand-up comedy.  It's just, they're gone.  Are they, I was going to ask, are they still doing comedy, but in some weird fucking places?  Who the fuck even knows?  They just disappear.  I don't even know.  Some of them just disappear, man.  A lot of them, a lot of the guys that I started with in D.C., these headliners, ended up on morning radio doing AM.  Oh, really?  Not like satellite stuff, but I mean, like, AM, local, and angry, like, beyond conservative. 
[02:53:30]  You know, like, there was a guy, I remember a guy that I used to work with, and we weren't really friends, work with him, and he was going off about, well, you know, I used to be a comedian and black people in clubs.  Let me tell you something, because I've actually experienced it, I'm like, yeah, it was, well, but it was like, I see what you're saying, but you're basing four, you're basing a political philosophy on three bad nights that you had at Garvin's.  Which, by the way, were bad nights, but you need to, like, and, like, that was his argument with the call, yeah, oh, God, you ever do Garvin's? 
[02:54:00]  No, but I remember the name from D.C.  Garvin's was, their big claim to fame, they're gone, is that they had Dave Chappelle starting out.  He got his start there, and they treated him like such absolute dog shit that he left for New York, and then I remember a club, another club, not Garvin's, but one a lot like Garvin's, Dave Chappelle was getting ready for his first hour, the Killingham Softly, and his managers called the club and said,  Dave would like to do the weekend, you can have him for $800 for the whole weekend, he just wants to do sets. 
[02:54:30]  You know, this is the last minute, all you gotta do is give him $800, so, you know, this is Dave Chappelle, you know, right?  Yeah, he probably just wanted some money to fucking grab some food or pay for his own.  Yeah, exactly, and they wouldn't pay him, they wouldn't do it, and then I heard the two managers talking, and one of them was like,  fucking kid, used to MC here for $25 a set five years ago, and suddenly I had to give him $800.  Like, well, because he's not the kid, you, like, in their mind, you're just frozen there, and that's where you are. 
[02:55:00]  How great is it that they're gone? How great is it that they're gone?  Oh, they're all, the whole thing just collapsed.  That's great.  Yeah, yeah.  It is nice when you get a club from a scumbag club, a club owner running it, and then it just goes belly up.  Good.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, it's just the...  And I've been with bands, too, and we used to play, and, you know, at the end of the night, you go to get paid,  and there's always a problem, you know.  Well, you know, we had the door count, and it was this.  It's like, we had our own guy with it, and, you know, I gotta go with my guy. 
[02:55:30]  And you're like, you're just, you're really gonna screw me on 25 people, you prick.  Like, you do realize this can't sustain.  Like, eventually, your club is just gonna collapse.  Right, right, right.  There's no way, if you keep pissing the talent on, no one will come back here.  Yeah, just fucking everyone over.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fascinating.  And they all try to.  Yes, yes.  They all try to fuck you for eight seats or ten seats.  Or, you know, we're doing a golden ticket thing, you know, but you weren't supposed to, 
[02:56:00]  because we have a contracted ticket price.  And they all try to get an extra few dollars.  See, that's what, again, if they were trying to fuck me over for 20 grand, I would at least  respect that I'm dealing with a supervillain.  But when you're dealing with someone, I mean, like, you're, I just talked to you for 20 minutes  because you were trying to get, like, $48 out of me.  That's what, that's what drives me crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  That much.  And it's weird when you have these, like, old clubs that, like, for years you worked in, 
[02:56:30]  and then you realize that it's 2013, and you're going back to the Comedy Cabaret at  Polko's Restaurant in Doylestown.  Oh, Jimmy.  Tickets are on sale now.  I'm working on my new hour, so I'm just going to, just to work, I'm going to have, like,  maybe some paper with me and just work on material.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  No, when I was doing this, I just taped my new special in July, and I did the same thing.  There was a, I did a, every Thursday night, I did a, there's this little art gallery 
[02:57:00]  near me that also does stand up, and I go, let me just have Thursday nights, and I got  to go there every night for three months.  And then I would also go every Monday, one Monday and Tuesday morning, I'd go down to  the Irvine Improv, which is in a mall, and you've got to edit your shit, like, you can't  just go, let's just see where this goes.  Like, no, they want to see a show.  So all the stuff that I would kind of spew out at the art gallery, I then had to go edit  down in Irvine.  Oh, wow, that's a great idea.  And it really helped.  It was really good.  Yeah, yeah.  That's really smart.  Yeah, I love doing stuff like that. 
[02:57:30]  I usually do that right before a special is shot.  Like, I'll usually go in the smaller rooms and just completely, but that's, you know,  you're seeing the special almost.  This is, I probably have, since I shot, probably 35 new minutes.  Already?  Yeah, about five months.  It's been five months.  Oh, man.  35 new months.  But, uh, 30 minutes.  So I would say, uh, you know, you'll have close to a new 45, and I'll play with the crowd  a little bit.  But I love doing that.  That's great.  I saw Colin in Long Island City when he was just starting, working on the last...  Unconstitutional, yeah.  Yeah, Unconstitutional.  No kidding. 
[02:58:00]  And it was fucking, it was great.  Just watch him, and he'd go through something and be like, hmm, well, that don't work.  But it was great just watching him throw that shit around and try to fix it.  And he says the same thing on HBO when he does it.  Yeah.  I didn't go over.  I don't know.  God, how fucking funny is he?  He's amazing.  It's depressing.  It really is.  It's fantastic, man.  I could do maybe one joke on the Constitution, and it would wind up being about Ben Franklin's  gay socks. 
[02:58:30]  And he didn't even write the Constitution.  That's the best you got from last week.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.

[03:03:00]  Show.  This is Jim Florentine's podcast, Comedy Metal Midgets.  Welcome to the Jim Florentine Comedy Metal Midgets podcast.  We're back.  Yes.  This new topic this week is basically going to be the brow beating that goes on in relationships.  And it's mostly by women.  20% by guys.  But I'd say 80% of women are doing it.  And we'll get to that in a second.  Because I got a lot of rage on this. 
[03:03:30]  Drives me nuts.  I don't know if you guys have satellite radio.  I do a show every week on Ozzy's Boneyard.  It's channel 38, Sirius XM.  5 to 7 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time.  Two hours of metal.  I talk and play a bunch of shit.  And then it's also replays.  Saturdays from 1 to 3 p.m.  Sundays 9 to 11 p.m.  at night.  And then Tuesdays 10 a.m.  to noon.  All Eastern Standard Time.  And if you have Sirius XM on demand, all the shows are up there.  So check it out if you can for you metalheads out there. 
[03:04:00]  Joe in Northeastern Maryland left me a message about browbeating.  How his wife just browbeats him in a relationship.  And drives him nuts.  And he can do nothing right no matter what.  And she just bitches and complains.  And constantly just, you know, treats him like a piece of shit.  And I said, that's a great idea for a podcast.  Because I am very in that world.  Not in my relationship.  My personal relationship.  Because I wouldn't put up with that.  I wouldn't marry somebody like that. 
[03:04:30]  I wouldn't be in a relationship with somebody like that.  But I constantly see it all the time.  Doing stand-up comedy.  I've been doing the clubs for over 20 years now.  Mostly couples go to a comedy club.  People that are in relationships.  You know, that are dating or married.  That's 90% of a comedy crowd.  People that are, you know, five, six dates and whatever.  Or, you know, three, four years dating.  Or married, 15, eight, three years.  And I constantly see the fucking, the tension in relationships. 
[03:05:00]  Especially with a couple beers, you know, at the comedy club.  The alcohol really brings the friggin' truth out.  And there's just a lot of drama going on.  And I can spot her from a mile away in every relationship.  You just see the sour puss on the girl's face.  And the guy trying to have fun.  And she's disgusted by everything he says.  When you see that face like a girl just drank, like, you know, a load of semen.  And it was kind of sour.  And it tasted bad.  You know there's major problems in that relationship. 
[03:05:30]  And I see a lot of those faces.  And look, it goes with the girls, the guys too.  Like, you know, you know, the girl just friggin' needs a lot of attention.  Is yelling out, screaming, causing a scene.  Because no one's, you know, because everyone's focused on the stage, the comic, and not her.  So she decides, hey, I need attention.  And the guy's face is like, ugh.  Again.  And I see it on the guy's face too.  So it's not all just women.  I'd say 80%.  And then there's 20%, you know, of women that do that. 
[03:06:00]  And just, yeah.  And it's funny.  Because the girl will be yelling at me.  You're not funny.  Or you say, tell a joke.  That's not true.  You know, if I do something about a relationship.  You're not, no.  That doesn't happen to me.  Shut up.  And I just tell the guy in the audience.  I go, sir.  What are you doing?  I go, I have a feeling this isn't the first night this has happened.  Where she has caused a scene.  And you're disgusted.  I could tell by the wear and tear on your face that you've gone through this a lot. 
[03:06:30]  Why?  Why are you doing this?  And then she's yelling back at me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all the shit.  So then I'm like, sir, just look around the room.  You see other couples here, right?  You see them all around.  Look, nobody else is doing this, okay?  Most girls don't act like this.  They really don't.  You don't have to put up with this.  You don't.  Do you hate yourself that much that you're stuck in this relationship?  And you have to deal with this shit.  You don't look at these other girls. 
[03:07:00]  They're sitting there and behave that they didn't laugh at a joke.  They just go, oh, no, I didn't like that one.  Or the next one they might like.  Whatever.  They're just sitting there, just fucking, just paying attention, not causing a scene.  You don't have to put up with this.  Talk to her.  Tell her, look, shut the fuck up.  I don't want, you know.  And then she's yelling at me back, tell a joke or whatever.  And I'm just like, sir, look at the bottom line.  Look at your chick.  She's not that hot.  If she was a 10, I could understand.  She's like a seven. 
[03:07:30]  All right, look at these other girls around here.  There's a lot of fucking eights and nines and tens in the crowd that are hotter and not doing this.  And then it just ends badly.  She gets dragged out.  He leaves.  She gives me the finger.  Fuck you.  I want my money back.  And he's like, whatever, dude.  Shakes his head, fucking puts his hand up in the air, and they walk out of the club.  That's probably happened.  It probably happens six times a year in my shows, easily.  The same scenario, same everything, you know. 
[03:08:00]  And then, or, you know, the guy tries to crack a joke, you know, go, hey, you know, work the crowd.  I go, how long are you married for?  The guy's like, uh, too long.  This is the response back from the crowd.  You hear, ooh, boo, boo.  You hear, asshole, jerk.  Now, let's flip that.  I say to the couple, how long are you married for?  And the girl says, too long.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:08:30]  Claps.  Applause breaks.  Got a better laugh than anything in my set the whole night from all the girls in the crowd.  because that's funny.  Like when a girl says too long in your relationship, that's funny  because it's a joke, but that's really funny  because she was just making a joke.  You see, she's married too long.  But when the guy does it, he's an asshole.  He's a jerk.  Women followed a girl in the bathroom later.  He just embarrassed you in front of 300 people.  I would never put up with that. 
[03:09:00]  I don't know how you'd do it.  I wouldn't.  You see what he did?  Everybody in the room thinks that your marriages are good  because what he said, all of that goes on.  But with the girl, it's fucking hilarious.  And I always call it out.  I go, that's a double standard, and I'm not falling for it.  You either laugh at both or you're grown at both.  It's the same thing, the same double standard with the fat, you know,  you can make a fat guy joke.  You can put a fat guy in a movie, a big slob with frigging, you know,  big man tits jumping off of, you know, a diving board 
[03:09:30]  and doing a belly flop in the pool and everybody's laughing  because it's funny.  God forbid a fat girl, oh, that's not funny.  You do a fat joke towards a fat girl, oh, that's mean.  Fat guy, hilarious.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  It's not, don't laugh at either.  Either laugh at both or don't laugh at either.  I will throw this exception out there.  The chick from Bridesmaids or whatever, Melissa McCarthy, is different. 
[03:10:00]  You see, that's what made that movie.  Yes, and I did see it, and there was like six good laughs in the movie.  It's not a total chick flick if you didn't see it.  I know I'll get shit for it, but anyway, she does a bunch of fat jokes  and they're fucking funny.  She's like a fat guy in the fat girl role.  And I guess this new movie she's got out, you know, my friend Bill Burr is in it,  so I probably will see it, even though, you know, Sandra Bullock, I'm not a fan or whatever.  But this chick is funny, this Melissa McCarthy. 
[03:10:30]  You guys know who she is, the fat girl from the shit, whatever sitcom it is.  I don't watch it, but you know who I'm talking about.  But anyway, she's the fat girl and makes fat jokes, and all of a sudden that's okay.  So let's hope that happens.  But let's look.  Let's go back in time and find out why we are at this position where the guy is just an idiot  and the girl is smart, and everything the guy does is wrong, and he's just, you know, 
[03:11:00]  I don't know how he functioned through life.  It all started with the fucking, and the kids, it all started with the commercials and the sitcoms  where dad was the stupid guy, and the wife and the kids were all smart.  And whatever dad did, oh, that's dad.  Dad comes up, dad, did you really do that in the garage?  Did you put the garage door open, garage door up backwards?  That's dad for you, dad.  And you want me to go to college? 
[03:11:30]  That's the little fucking snappy kid's remark.  And the woman, yeah, well, figure, dad, you know.  Really?  Dad's the same guy that fucking, you know, was paying the mortgage and, you know, bought the house  and everything else, and, you know, was raising three kids and working his ass off.  But that's the dumb one.  You know, he goes to his job nine to five.  He does that well somehow.  I don't know how, you know, but he's an idiot, basically.  And that's what got ingrained in everybody's head.  In every commercial, the woman's smart, and the guy does something stupid,  and he gives that little sheepish look, sorry, honey. 
[03:12:00]  And he's like, yeah, well, okay.  And, you know, the girl with a snappy comeback, and the guy just sits there and takes it.  That's what started this.  And then women saw those sort of sitcoms where the guy was dumb and sort of commercials,  and they go, hey, that's how my relationship's going to go.  And that's where the browbeating started.  Because our parents weren't like that.  You didn't see our dads walking around.  Think about your dad for a second.  You see your dad walking around.  Oh, I'm sorry, honey. 
[03:12:30]  I won't do that again.  All right, I'll go to my room.  Yeah, I'm just an idiot.  I don't know, you know.  No, you didn't see that.  Yeah, and the relationships were 100 times better, our parents, than what's going on now,  because of that shit.  They had respect for each other.  And mom didn't do that to your dad.  She didn't treat him like a piece of shit, like he's an idiot.  You know, women always think that, like, a guy is just, without them, they can't do anything.  It's funny, because, yeah, without them, they're fucking retarded. 
[03:13:00]  It's funny, like, you know, the guy will be, like, 34 years old, married five years.  Like, I'll make the sandwich.  I'll make your sandwich for work, because you don't even know how to work the toaster.  Really?  Before I met you at age 27, what did you think I did?  You think I just fucking, I didn't eat?  I didn't know how to get a piece of bread?  I didn't know how to make a sandwich?  I didn't know how to get in my car?  I didn't know when I needed to eat?  Did I just starve?  Was I living on the street, because I didn't know anything?  Holy shit, how do I get on a plane?  I didn't need my wife here, because if not, I'm a fucking idiot. 
[03:13:30]  Now, somehow they survived without you.  Just remember that.  You know, he doesn't even know how to wash the dishes.  Really?  Oh, yeah, because I never washed a dish in my life.  I know, I don't even know.  I just threw them out.  Before I met you, as soon as I ate off a plate, a fucking plate, I just threw it in the garbage.  And the silverware, too, because I don't know how to do dishes.  It was amazing.  I mean, I spent like fucking $50,000 in silverware and dishes.  Thank God I met you, because I would have no idea. 
[03:14:00]  I didn't know.  You put the water on it, you scrub it a little, and it gets clean.  Holy shit.  Thanks that I married you.  Because if not, I don't know, I'd be broke.  I'd be broke.  And that's where it all started.  I love it when a guy shifts on a woman in a commercial.  Just, you know, and that commercial's never on for more than like three months, because, you know, people didn't respond to it.  Because they're used to the girl shitting on the guy. 
[03:14:30]  So when the guy does it, you know, oh, no, that's not that funny.  That's a little mean.  What a disaster.  And this is what's going on in relationships.  There's just, have some self-respect for yourself.  If your wife is just fucking, just bothering you, and you do everything wrong, and you're an idiot, and she makes a face, you try to crack a joke, she makes a face every time. 
[03:15:00]  Everything you say, she's like, yeah, no, please.  He doesn't know what he's talking about in front of everybody, does all that shit.  But just tell her, hey, look, I'm not fucking putting up with this anymore.  That's all you got to say.  Just like, look, I'm not living the rest of my life like this, with this tension, that you got a problem with everything I do.  Because when you met me, you didn't have a problem.  It's funny, because, you know, what happens in relationships is women, when they're dating a guy that's boring.  He's got a good job, he's a good dude, or whatever, but he's just not that exciting. 
[03:15:30]  You know, and women, you know, they need excitement, right?  So then they break up, she breaks up with that guy, or the guy breaks up with her, and she's like, I need something different.  And she goes to the local bar, and she sees some guy at the corner of the bar causing a scene.  He's fucking drinking shots.  He's cursing.  He's yelling.  He's putting, like, fucking Lynyrd Skynyrd on the jukebox and singing at the top of his lungs.  Hey, do another shot.  Hey, you know, putting his arm around everybody, having a blast.  A fucking guy's guy.  He's sweating. 
[03:16:00]  You know, he's wearing the fucking Judas Priest shirt and camouflage shorts.  Doesn't care.  He comes over to you.  Hey, do a shot, honey.  I don't know.  What is it?  Don't worry about it.  Just do it.  I'm just kind of intrigued by that.  Like, wow, this guy's fun.  My last boyfriend would never do this.  He didn't want to hang out in the bar.  Maybe he had a glass of wine, and then we had to go home.  So she's intrigued by that.  Next thing I know, she's hanging out with him.  He's got his arm around it.  They're singing songs at the jukebox. 
[03:16:30]  She's hammered.  She's doing shots.  She never did.  Drinking whiskey.  She never did that before because the last boyfriend, oh, no, he'd only let me drink my  freaking specialty beers.  He only wanted the fucking wheat pumpkin special edition shit.  Gets the number.  They start dating.  Mike, the next day, he stays over a house that night because he's hammered.  She goes, I don't want you to drive.  And he sleeps on the couch, whatever.  He wakes up in the same clothes.  Hey, let's go to Atlantic City. 
[03:17:00]  There's a party bus going down.  I mean, my buddies.  Jump on.  Let's go.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Just go.  Really?  When are you coming back?  I don't know.  You don't even know?  No, we're just going to go down there and fucking go gamble and drink and we'll go see  a concert or whatever.  Just jump on the bus.  Call a couple girlfriends.  Let's go.  Yeah, but I don't know if I'm going to be back tonight or tomorrow.  Who gives a shit?  Tomorrow's Sunday.  You got the whole day off.  Who cares?  We get back late tonight or tomorrow?  All right.  Then she's like, oh, my God.  This guy doesn't even make plans. 
[03:17:30]  He just doesn't even give a shit.  This is kind of exciting.  You know, the last guy, my last boyfriend, he didn't map out everything and fucking,  you know, we're going here at this time and here and here.  And I didn't like being structured like that.  I like living like this.  This is fun.  Jumps on the bus.  They go down to Atlantic City, have a blast.  They get hammered again two days in a row.  He doesn't even change his clothes, right?  She's like, what about you're out?  I'll just wear the same thing.  My friend, you got any deodorant I could throw on?  Yeah, but it's women. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  Fuck it.  I'll fuck.  I don't care.  I'm going to hang around my buddies.  I don't give a shit if I smell, wears the same outfit the next day, gets on the bus.  They have a blast.  She gets home Sunday afternoon, calls all her girlfriends.  Oh my God.  I met this guy.  He's wild.  He's fun.  I don't know.  It's just, I never did something like that before.  It was really exciting.  He just didn't even give a shit.  He just said, let's just, and we just had a blast.  We didn't even know where we're going to eat.  We didn't make dinner reservations.  You know, I didn't know what beer I was drinking.  I didn't know any, I just, it was fun. 
[03:18:30]  He wore the same outfit two days in a row.  He slept over my house.  He's like, I don't give a shit.  And he bought this, and he wore it again.  He didn't even care.  We went to a nice restaurant at one point, and he just sent his camouflage shorts and  a Judas Priest concert t-shirt.  And I was like, he's like, whatever.  I don't give a shit if people look at it.  I mean, I was kind of, I like that.  Oh my God.  I think I really like this guy.  Cut to three years later. 
[03:19:00]  They're married.  They're going to their friend's barbecue.  And what is she doing?  She's laying out an outfit for him on his bed for him to wear.  This is three years later.  He walks in.  He's like, what's this?  Oh, you know what?  I picked out an outfit for you to wear it at a barbecue.  So, you know, I think this will be good.  This is what?  Fucking khakis and a polo shirt? 
[03:19:30]  What the fuck is this?  What's going on with this?  Yeah, you know those shoes that you bought for the party?  You know, for the wedding we went to?  Yeah, those would go good with this.  With the khakis and the polo shirt.  Yeah, but I don't wear this shit.  I wear it like once a year if I have to go to an office party or something.  Yeah, I know, but it's just I think that this will be good for the party because, you know, Nick and Lisa's, you know, their company, all the people from the company are going to be there. 
[03:20:00]  And they work for like this really, you know, upscale company and all of her friends are going to be there.  So they're probably going to, you know, dress similar.  He's like, yeah, but I, you know, I've known Nick and Lisa my whole life and a bunch of their other friends are going to be there.  I'm going to know a lot of people there.  And, you know, I'm going to wear what I usually wear, like a camouflage shorts.  And I probably won't wear a concert t-shirt, but I'll wear another t-shirt because that's what I'm comfortable in.  Yeah, but I know, but it's, I don't want her, her office people looking at you all weird because they're going to be dressed like that. 
[03:20:30]  I don't get, what the fuck do I care?  Yeah, but I care.  Yeah, but I don't.  I want to be comfortable.  I'm going to my friend's barbecue in his backyard.  It's fucking July.  I'm not wearing khakis.  I don't, I never wear this shit and I'm not going to wear it now.  I want to be comfortable.  Did you hear that?  This is what I always wear on the weekends.  All right.  I work my ass off during the week.  I'm going to wear camouflage shorts and a t-shirt.  That's what it's going to be fucking hot out.  And that's what I'm wearing. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, but everybody else, her, I bet you all of her people from her office are going to be dressed like this.  And I just don't want, I don't want people looking at you and talking behind your back.  Oh, I don't give a shit.  Why would I care?  I don't even know those people.  Who cares if they're talking behind my back?  Let them.  I'm never going to see them again.  And even if I do, who cares?  I'm not worried about that.  Why would I worry about people that I don't even know what they think?  So you want me to be uncomfortable in shit that I never wear just so people that I've never met before don't talk behind my back? 
[03:21:30]  Because I'm really concerned about that.  I mean, I'm going to fucking wiretap the place just to hear what people are saying about me.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm going to be drinking Coors Light out of a can.  That's what I drink.  And they'll be drinking their fucking crafty fucking, you know, pumpkin special edition beers.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, but do it for me.  Please just do it for me.  I just, I'm going to feel weird.  And I just know people are going to be looking at me like, that's the girl. 
[03:22:00]  That's the guy who's married to that guy.  That's what everybody's going to be saying.  I go, what people?  Well, from her office.  Yeah, but you never met them before.  Why do you give a shit?  I seriously, then we won't go.  I'm not going then.  If you're going to wear your, I'm not going.  And that's, all of that happened because she was worried about other people at the party and not getting embarrassed.  The guy's not going in a fucking G-string and a tank top.  He's not.  That I could say, hey, you're going to embarrass me. 
[03:22:30]  Put something, put some clothes on.  I get it.  And that's the problem in a nutshell in relationships.  The woman liked the guy.  Remember the first night in the bar?  He was wild.  He was drinking shots.  He's cursing.  He's swearing.  He's singing.  The next day to get on the bus, they went to Atlantic City, wore the same outfit two days in a row.  I like this, telling all the girlfriends, cut to three years later, that shit's not funny anymore.  That's not appropriate to wear that outfit again.  No, you've got to do this.  So she liked the guy.  In the beginning, she liked him like that. 
[03:23:00]  That was what she got attracted to.  But then all of a sudden, she didn't find it.  She didn't like it anymore.  Well, that's your fucking fault.  Too bad.  Deal with it.  When you buy a dog, girls, do you bring the dog home and try to train it to be a cat?  Do you fucking browbeat the dog for hours?  Go meow.  Go meow.  Say meow. 
[03:23:30]  Do you make the dog, do you have the dog sit in the corner of your apartment and don't bring the dog outside to go walk?  Because that's a cat.  Did you put a litter box in the fucking, in the bathroom and the dog shitting on the carpet because you won't take it out?  Did you do that?  You wanted a dog.  You went to the, you went to the, I'm going to go to the frigging, you know, the mall in one of those places that, you know, a pet store and get a dog. 
[03:24:00]  I want a dog.  Okay.  So you picked out the dog because you wanted the dog, right?  You didn't want a cat.  The cat wasn't even mentioned in it.  In the conversation when you went.  You brought the dog home.  It was awesome.  But then six months later, you wanted the dog to be a cat.  Why isn't this thing just, why does this thing want to go out?  I want him to go in the, in the litter box in the bathroom.  He won't say meow.  That's it in a nutshell.  You wanted a dog.  The dog's always going to act like a dog. 
[03:24:30]  Always going to be a dog.  You want a cat?  Then go get a fucking cat.  I love the silence too.  I know you guys do.  But it's unbelievable.  Listen, if you, all right, if you got a, if you're in a relationship and this is, if you're in a relationship, this is for the girls too, with the guys doing it.  If you're a significant other, like goes through your phone when you come home and check in to make sure you're not doing anything, get out of the relationship. 
[03:25:00]  It's over.  Your relationship is over.  If they're snooping around, looking at everything, who's on Facebook, who's this, this, this, all this.  Well, who's that?  I don't even know her.  Just, when are you going to come back?  Well, where did you go?  And how long were you there for?  And then where did you go next?  Get out of the relationship.  It's over.  Seriously, if you're going through text messages and phone calls and looking at their phone and where they were going through their computer to see what sites they're on, your relationship is over. 
[03:25:30]  Why are you with that person?  You don't trust them, obviously, right?  Obviously, if you're going through their phone and looking at their computer, you don't trust them.  So why are you in that relationship?  What exactly are you looking for?  When you go through their phone, when they get home, whether it's the girl or the guy, what are you looking for?  You're looking forward to seeing she contacted somebody else, a guy or an ex-boyfriend or something?  Well, obviously, you don't trust her if you're looking through her phone.  So just get out of the relationship.  Find somebody you trust.  In a nutshell, it's that fucking easy. 
[03:26:00]  If you think all that stuff's going on behind your back, you're that crazy and that jealous, get out.  If you really think that person's going to do that to you, why would you want to be with that person?  Why?  Look at a good relationship.  Just think for a second.  Someone that's been with some of your friends or your brother or sister or someone that's married like 20, 25 years.  Maybe high school sweethearts in a great relationship, right?  Everybody knows a few of them. 
[03:26:30]  Go ask them if they're going to each other's phones when they come home.  Ask them if they're looking at Facebook pages and have their passwords just to see what's going on and snooping.  Ask them.  Ask them if they, when the guy goes to the bar and does his wife go, hey, send me a picture.  I want to make sure you're there.  Ask them if that goes on.  And you know what?  A hundred percent time, a hundred percent of the time they're going to say, no.  Well, no, I don't give a shit.  I don't even go through my own phone. 
[03:27:00]  No, I mean, why would I do that?  I'm not going to go through her phone.  Exactly.  Are you, did she look at you like, no, I mean, no.  She has her computer, I got mine.  It's, why, why would she go through mine?  She has her own.  Exactly.  You trust your wife being out?  Yeah, she went out with the girlfriends.  I stayed home, watched the game.  It was cool, you know.  No, she likes, you didn't ask her to send a picture from the bar she's at to make sure she's actually there.  What the fuck?  No, I can't even get pictures to my phone. 
[03:27:30]  I don't give a shit.  No, well, why would I do, for what?  Did you, you didn't, you didn't text her like 75 times?  Every place that she went next, you know, well, how long are you going to be there for?  All right, well, text me when you're leaving there.  And text me when you get to the next bar.  And how long, who are you hanging out with there?  And is there any girls there?  Is there any guy, good looking guys there?  I bet you there is.  That's why, why'd you stay there that long?  When are you coming home?  See, you're having fun without me, aren't you? 
[03:28:00]  How come we never go out?  None.  Did you get any, you send any of those texts out?  No.  I just said, have a good night.  If you need a ride home and everybody's drunk, I'll come pick you up.  That's the only thing I said.  Or I, I said a text.  Have fun, honey.  Hope you have a, I love you.  That was it.  Isn't that weird?  Isn't that weird?  That relationships that work, none of that shit goes on.  None of that drama.  None.  And they're happy and they've been together and they trust each other and that's it. 
[03:28:30]  That's a fucking normal relationship.  Not, you know, I just, I don't want to piss her off.  Look, I don't need the aggravation when I get home.  Look, your wife doesn't want you to go to a strip club.  I get it.  You know what?  She goes, hey, I don't feel comfortable you being in there.  You know what?  You got it.  You got to go.  All right, honey.  I respect your decision.  You got like a hot girl friend, just a friend that she's a little jealous of.  And she's like, look, I really don't want you going out with her.  We'll see her at some, you know, functions or whatever parties, but I don't want you going 
[03:29:00]  to meet her for lunch.  You know what?  You got to go.  All right, honey.  I wish I don't want to, you know, fuck up our marriage.  I get it.  I understand that.  You know, if she was same thing, she was on the other foot where, you know, she had  a good looking ex guy friend.  You might be a little jealous.  I get it.  You know, there's everyone's going to have a little jealousy.  I don't feel comfortable when you guys go out.  All right, no problem.  You got to meet them halfway.  That's part of your marriage.  That's part of commitment.  But other than that, what is she looks through my phone when I get home?  I got to be careful. 
[03:29:30]  Careful of what?  Tell her, hey, fuck off.  Fuck off.  This is my phone.  I don't go through your phone.  I don't give a shit.  What are you trying to find when you're snooping around?  Seriously, there's a question out there to the men and the women.  What are you trying?  So you're hoping you find something that you catch them.  Is that what you're doing?  Is that what you're hoping?  What's your ultimate goal by snooping?  To go, see, I told you, you were talking to her and you said you weren't. 
[03:30:00]  Is that, so now what did you prove?  So where does it go from here?  It's a fucking nightmare.  It's unbelievable what's going on.  I'm telling you, man, you got, you know, you get in a relationship with somebody, you go,  look, this is what I like and I'm probably going to like it the rest of my life.  So, all right, look, if you're doing drugs and shit like that, I get it. 
[03:30:30]  Don't, but don't even get in that relationship.  But if you, you know, a big sports fan, you like watching sports a lot and you know that going in,  don't be mad at the guy fucking five years later on a Tuesday night and a Thursday night and a Sunday  when he's watching like basketball and baseball and football, what do you think was going to happen?  Do you think the 28 years he lived before he met you, that he watched sports,  he was a big sports nut and that was his fucking passion and that was his stress relief 
[03:31:00]  after working his ass off and working his job to sit down and watch a fucking game.  Do you think all of a sudden, since he met you, that now he's not supposed to like that anymore?  That stress outlet's not supposed to be there anymore?  Are you fucking kidding me?  You think you're that important?  You think you're that?  That he, all of a sudden, you know, you watch sports too much.  Yeah, but I, that's what I like doing.  I don't go to bars.  I don't fucking go to Vegas with my friends.  I don't hang out in nightclubs.  I don't get a bottle service at a table and wear a fucking button down like those douchebags. 
[03:31:30]  Hey, you want to come over girls?  And they're fucking dancing.  The goofy white guy with his hand in the air like, yeah, yo, yo.  I'm not that guy.  I'm not interested.  I don't hang out in strip clubs.  I don't do any of that.  I don't fucking gamble.  I don't go to the racetrack.  I don't go to casinos.  I don't blow any of my money.  But I like watching a game on a Tuesday night.  To me, that's what I like doing.  It makes me happy. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, but my show's on American Idol.  And, you know, we should watch it together.  Yeah, but I don't...  The fuck?  I'm 34 years old.  I don't watch fucking shows that, you know, my 12-year-old niece watches.  Yeah, but if we could just watch it together.  Don't ever make your significant other go to a place they don't want to be.  That is my fucking main...  That is the main...  The main point I can make in this podcast.  Don't ever do that because it just builds up resentment, resentment, resentment. 
[03:32:30]  They don't want to be there.  And then eventually they act out.  Whether they fucking have an affair or they blow up at you.  Fucking physical violence, you know, verbal, whatever.  Just that's when that shit starts.  My wife's a big country fan.  Loves country shows.  I'll go to a country show with her.  And I'm not going because, all right, I better just do it.  I don't mind going.  I'm not a big country fan, but I don't mind going.  It's a two, three-hour show from 8 to 11 at night. 
[03:33:00]  No big deal.  I like live music.  At least they play their instruments.  They all play.  They actually sing.  Unlike any fucking hip-hop or fucking dance pop act that's all played by tapes.  And just fucking run around lip-sync.  I don't want to see that.  I will never go to something like that.  But live music, I'll go see.  So I'll go to a...  And then what I do, since I...  You know, I'm like, all right, I'll go.  What the hell?  I don't really know any...  I know one song or whatever.  She has a good time. 
[03:33:30]  That's fine.  I don't sit there and mope.  I don't fucking go,  Oh, this sucks.  This fucking blows.  This song blows.  I don't sit there and fucking...  Like a lump on a log and just bitch all night.  I know what I'm getting into.  I'm like, hey, you know what?  Two, three hours out of my life.  No big deal.  Makes her happy.  All right.  A lot of her friends aren't country fans.  So she doesn't have 10 other people she can go with.  But in return, I don't go, yeah, well, you better go to OzFest with me then.  You better go to MayhemFest with Five Finger Death Punch, Rob Zombie, and Hatebreed. 
[03:34:00]  Because I went to that country show.  Don't fucking drag them there.  They don't want to be there.  I don't drag my wife to those shows.  I know she doesn't want...  She's not going to have a good time.  It's loud.  It's fucking hot.  A bunch of angry white guys fucking sweating, a lot of fucking body odor, all of that shit.  Shitty food, shitty beer, and fucking, you know, heavy music that she has no idea what is.  I'm not going to do that.  I know better.  But don't just, well, I went to your country show.  You got to go to my show.  Don't. 
[03:34:30]  My wife likes romantic comedies.  When one comes out, she doesn't even bring it up.  If she wants to go see it in a theater or if it's on demand, she doesn't go,  Hey, you want to watch this?  I, the Sandra Bullock one.  It looks good.  She doesn't even, because she knows I will never watch that.  And that's one thing I'll go, absolutely not.  Because I'll sit there and be miserable for an hour and a half.  I'll be fucking critiquing the movie.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see that coming.  Oh, really?  Now she's going to, she doesn't like the guy in the beginning, but then all of a sudden she likes him.  Let me guess.  They're going to break up three quarters of the movie. 
[03:35:00]  And then at the end, they're going to get back together.  Oh, and she's going to trip because she's clumsy.  And that's going to make it funny whenever she walks into a wall.  You know, because that's what, you know, guys like hot chicks that are clumsy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'll do the whole movie.  I'll be fucking fidgeting like a little fucking kid next to her.  She knows that.  I know that.  So that's the one I go, absolutely not.  The country show?  Yeah, no problem.  I'll go with you.  I'll fucking sit there and just enjoy it just like you do. 
[03:35:30]  I like that you get so much enjoyment out of it.  That makes me happy.  That's how it fucking works.  Yes, but she knows a romantic comedy.  I got to sit there.  There's going to be a lot of tension.  She went to a Broadway show with her family six months ago.  She goes, I didn't even ask if you wanted a ticket.  I go, good.  That was the right move because I'm not going.  I don't like singing and dancing.  I never liked it.  I don't like any of that shit.  It's goofy.  It's silly, but chicks like it.  No problem. 
[03:36:00]  Go.  She went with her family.  Beautiful.  If I would have went, got dragged into the city, had to fucking sit there and get a,  you know, for two, three hour show, whatever it is, I would have been miserable.  Miserable.  And we just know that.  And that's why the relationship works.  Stop.  Well, you have to go.  No, you've got to go with me too.  There's great books on relationships.  This guy, Don Miguel Ruiz. 
[03:36:30]  There's a book called The Four Agreements.  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  Read that book about relationships.  It's not so much about relationships, but just about in life in general.  Also, he wrote a relationship book called Mastery of Love.  Read those books.  And that's where I got that dog quote out of.  The dog, you didn't want to change him to a cat?  Because I fucking love that.  Read those books.  I'm telling you, man.  It explains relationships.  It breaks it down in a nutshell.  All the fucking drama.  All the assumptions everybody makes.  You know, listen, just think of the drama that goes on when you're at, you know, 
[03:37:00]  your phone dies because you're in an area where, whatever it is.  You go out with your friends and your battery is dead.  Nobody has a charger for the iPhone 5, so you can't charge a battery.  Now, your wife's at home sending you fucking texts every 17 seconds,  wondering how come you're not getting back to her.  She's out of her mind.  She's fucking looking online, snooping around, trying to figure out, calling friends, 
[03:37:30]  waking people up at 1 in the morning.  Are you with Jim?  No.  What are you talking about?  I'm sleeping.  I got work tomorrow.  He hasn't got back to me.  Could you call?  All of this shit, all of this shit going on.  He comes in at 1.30 when he was supposed to come home, and she's up.  Where the fuck were you?  What do you mean?  You didn't respond to my 75 text message.  Yeah, well, my battery died.  What?  Yeah, look at my phone.  See?  My battery died.  I left the house.  It was only like 40%.  I should have charged before I left, but I forgot.  And by the time fucking hanging out or whatever in this battery shit anyway, it died. 
[03:38:00]  Oh.  You don't know how worried I was ready to call 911.  I was going to call the cops.  I called your parents, but then I hung up because I was going to wake them.  All of that drama for that shit.  Because it was just an assumption that he was out doing something.  He got in a car accident.  He's fucking cheating on you.  All of that stuff.  And none of it was going on.  It was just a dead battery.  But you never put that in the fucking equation. 
[03:38:30]  And for four hours, you had every fucking negative thought in your head what was going on.  And none of it was.  He was sitting at the bar with his two guy friends with fucking six people in the whole place.  He was out of Fridays.  Okay?  There was three fucking people at the bar and him and his two buddies at a table.  That's it.  That's all that was in there.  And they were watching the fucking St. Louis Cardinal Milwaukee Brewer game on ESPN.  And fucking eating food.  You really think something was going on? 
[03:39:00]  This is what you do.  Your wife or your husband or your boyfriend, whatever, goes, look, you know, go with me to this thing, whatever event it is.  And you tell them no, and they keep fucking asking you.  Then you just go, honey, will it really mean a lot to you if I go?  Phrase it that way.  And if she goes, it really will.  All right, I'll go.  You take the bullet.  Okay, if that really means a lot to her, that's how you phrase it. 
[03:39:30]  If it doesn't, then fucking stop bothering me.  Okay?  I know a guy whose wife gets so jealous when he goes out.  And he only goes out like three times a year.  That after we watched a sporting event, we're going to go to another bar to have a couple beers.  And she was mad that he was going. 
[03:40:00]  He was out of town.  It wasn't like he was, you know, not late coming home.  She took a picture of all his clothes in boxes by the door and sent it to him.  You think that's a good relationship?  You think that's normal?  Look, if you don't have kids and this shit's going on, get the fuck out of the relationship.  Seriously.  If you're getting browbeaten, everything you do is dumb.  Your boyfriend's jealous.  Your husband is.  All he does is, you know, just say mean things to you. 
[03:40:30]  Treat you like shit.  All right?  Just fucking everything you do is wrong.  You're an asshole.  Why would you do that?  The guy, same way.  Your girl thinks you're dumb.  You're an idiot.  Treats you like shit.  Doesn't let you hang out with your friends anymore.  All of that stuff.  Look, if you've got a guy friend, he gets hookers and fucking happy endings at massage parlors.  Your wife goes, I don't want you hanging out with that guy.  I get it.  You know what?  You've got to choose.  You want to hang out with that scumbag or your wife. 
[03:41:00]  You know, she has a point there.  But if she doesn't like a friend because who knows what?  You know, because God forbid a woman doesn't overanalyze every situation.  You look, look, the guy's been my friend for 33 years.  Now I've got to stop hanging out with him?  Why?  Because she fucking, you know, you don't like that he drinks a lot and he swears or, you know, whatever it is.  Yeah, too bad.  I'm going to fucking hang out with him every once in a while.  Seriously, just get out of the relationship now.  If someone's snooping through your phone and looking, I want to see your phone, get out. 
[03:41:30]  Your relationship's over.  You don't trust that, but get out.  No reason to be in that.  Because we don't know what they're looking for.  But once they find it, ah, see, I got you.  I knew.  Just ask them.  If you don't trust them, what the fuck are you with them for?  I don't get it.  What is going on?  Are we that damaged?  Are people that we have to stay in a relationship because it is fucking shit? 
[03:42:00]  Is that the way you want to live the rest of your life?  When you look back when you're 70 years old and sitting on your porch,  are you going to be happy that you fucking wasted 30 years of your life married to someone that just fucking treated you like a piece of shit?  Was it worth it?  Don't you think?  If you could look back and go, if there was one thing I could have done,  I should have got out of that relationship when I knew it was fucking going to be bad.  Why do you want?  You got one life.  Why would you want to fucking live like that?  There's somebody out there for you. 
[03:42:30]  There is.  Somebody's going to understand and someone's going to understand this is the way this person is  and I'm not going to try to change them.  If I don't like the way they are, I'm not getting in the relationship.  There's people out there that get that.  That guy, that's just the way he is.  That's the way she is.  So why would I, you know, why would I want to move this relationship to the next level if I know that's just the way she is?  She's never going to change.  That's what she likes.  So either I deal with it or I fucking move on.  That's it.  That's that fucking simple. 
[03:43:00]  Especially if you don't have kids.  If you don't have kids with this person, get the fuck out.  Who cares?  Well, we got a nice place.  We got a good condo and I really like, so what?  So what?  Find a fucking, find your own apartment.  Move on with your life.  In a fucking year or two when that shit's over and you get over the fucking, you know, the breakup of the relationship and you find somebody new, you're going to look back.  Oh, I can't believe I dealt with that shit for that long.  That's what you're going to be thinking.  It's going to suck for a while, but then all of a sudden you get like, damn, this is the way life should be. 
[03:43:30]  This is the way you fucking live life.  Everything in your life is going to be better.  God.  Your significant other is not that stupid.  All right.  Stop thinking they are.  That's your fucking issue.  That's your problem.  Maybe you got issues with your daddy and daddy did.  I don't know what's going on, but stop fucking.  All right.  He's not that dumb.  It's fucking, I love how the women, you know, I'm independent. 
[03:44:00]  I'm independent.  I don't need a man.  I believe me.  I don't need anybody.  I'm an independent woman.  I could do it on my own.  Yeah.  Then you get in a relationship with him fucking a year later.  I want you to go to my step niece's second birthday party.  Nah, I'm not going to that.  There's a bunch of fucking kids there and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to go play fucking softball with my friends.  Yeah, but I, I want you to go. 
[03:44:30]  I'm not fucking going.  I'm not hanging out with a bunch of kids on a Saturday afternoon.  I work my ass off.  Well, yeah, but why do you want me to go?  I'm just going to feel weird without you there.  What happened?  What happened?  You being independent.  All of a sudden you're not independent anymore.  You can't really, you can't go somewhere by yourself.  Remember, remember when I first met you?  We went on our first couple of dates.  I don't need a man.  I haven't had a man in a year.  I'm independent.  I do my own thing.  Really?  What happened to that?  So you were fucking full of shit, weren't you? 
[03:45:00]  I'm independent.  I don't need anybody yet.  Then go fuck yourself.  Miss independent.  Go fuck yourself.  Everybody's going to be looking weird at the party.  If they're going to ask where you are.  Yeah, well, tell him.  He doesn't hang out with two-year-olds.  Tell him the truth.  He doesn't hang out with two-year-olds that he doesn't know, especially if he doesn't know.  Now get in your truck, Miss Independent, and go to your fucking stupid birthday party. 
[03:45:30]  I hate you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I just want you to go.  I feel weird being here by...  Nobody's focusing on you.  You're not going to feel weird there being here by yourself.  The fucking moms, the fucking stupid fucking soccer moms, just babbling and gossiping around.  Everybody's going to go, where's your husband?  He's at home.  He just had some stuff to do around the house.  Okay.  And that's it. 
[03:46:00]  Nobody's focusing on you.  There's fucking 32-year-olds running around, fucking grabbing TVs and iPads, and they're moving shit and knocking over glasses and running upstairs, and you're fucking blocking the stairs so no kids get hurt.  That's what's going on.  Nobody's focused on you, Miss Independent.  You're not that important.  So, Miss Independent, go fuck yourself.  I don't need anybody good than fucking, I'm moving out.  All right. 
[03:46:30]  I'm done.  I hope I help somebody here somehow with my fucking dumb, stupid logic.  But in some weird way, it's going to make some sense to some people.  The rest are going to go, what the fuck is wrong with him, which I like, too.  All right.  I'm running out of prank calls, so I only got a few more weeks at ease, but we always end the podcast with a prank call. 
[03:47:00]  This is off of one of the Crank Angers calls I did back in the day for Comedy Central, and this is ridiculous, just like this podcast, this call.  It's called, what the fuck is it, Special Ed Slow or Special People, and this is not looped.  This is a real call.  This happened.  There was no editing done at all. 
[03:47:30]  This is how many times I said the same phrase over and over to this guy.  So, we'll see you next week, and Miss Independent, I'm independent.  I don't need anyone.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  You're full of shit.  You need a lot of people around you because you're insecure, and you overanalyze everything, and you just make a fucking, everything is a problem because you overanalyze it.  Just fucking live your life. 
[03:48:00]  Remember when you just got on that bus and went to Atlantic City the next day on a whim and didn't have any plans, didn't even know if you're coming back that night?  And look what happened.  You had a fucking good time.  It was one of the best times you ever had.  Remember calling all your girlfriends when you got home?  Oh, my God.  You're never going to believe my day.  Remember that?  That's the way to live life.  Miss Independent.  Stop fucking overanalyzing everything.  Leave your husbands alone.  They're not that dumb. 
[03:48:30]  If you think they're that dumb, then they married you, so that means they're really dumb.  If they were smart, maybe that's why you married him, because he's dumb, and he'll put up with your shit.  But, I mean, I'm independent.  I don't need a man.  Good for you.  Go fuck yourself at your two-year-old stepdaughter or whatever fucking birthday party. 
[03:49:00]  It's fun.  People are going to look at me like I'm weird.  No, they're not.  Nobody's looking at you.  They don't think you're weird.  They don't think anything.  They're like, oh, who's that fucking miserable woman over there in the corner with the puss on her face?  Why do you got a puss on your face?  Oh, because my husband wanted to stay home and relax, because he worked his ass off all week.  And he just wanted to chill.  Yeah, sounds reasonable.  So why are you upset?
