<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie detailing a truly disastrous day.  He recounted a series of misfortunes stemming from his own upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, and a broken tooth (courtesy of hummus).  His wife had bronchitis, his five-month-old was breastfeeding while on antibiotics, and his almost three-year-old had a double ear infection requiring penicillin and Benadryl.  A dentist appointment resulted in a $1200 crown estimate and accusations of sex tourism leveled at his dentist who was leaving for Thailand that night.  Returning home, his already chaotic family situation was compounded when his chocolate-fueled son shattered their 65-inch TV playing T-ball near his baby brother.  Things escalated when the son, unsupervised, took an elevator ride down twenty floors, only to be found crying and comforted by a building resident.  Opie ended this segment reflecting on the overwhelming nature of parenthood, likening his day to a "Hangover" movie and sharing childhood anecdotes of his own mishaps.

The show continued with discussions about childhood misadventures, fat jokes, and the lavish spending habits of celebrities like The Miz and Ric Flair contrasted with the hosts' frugality.  They discussed a YouTube video they created ("The Elevator Show") featuring The Miz.  Significant airtime was dedicated to promoting upcoming comedy shows featuring Jimmy Norton and Daryl Hammond, followed by a discussion of a food show featuring renowned chefs.  Personal anecdotes were shared, including one host's humorous relationship with a woman referred to as "Debbie" (whose contact name is "Free Tickets").  The show further delved into commentary on Justin Bieber's perceived drug use and declining popularity, and an analysis of the *Hangover 3* trailer.  This section included highly offensive and sexually explicit language criticizing Lena Dunham's appearance.  The segment closed with strong criticism and disparaging language directed towards New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policies and a mention of Beavis and Butthead's 20th anniversary.

The next segment began with further criticism of the *Hangover Part III* trailer, followed by enthusiastic commentary – using strong language – on a video of Mike Tyson's first professional fight.  After reading sponsored ads, including one for a sexual product, the hosts dissected a purported hospital photo of Justin Bieber and a video of Scooter Braun addressing his supposed collapse, expressing extreme skepticism and using vulgar language to suggest a publicity stunt.  This transitioned to a discussion about Opie's broken TV and a caller's story about a disappointing remote-controlled ghost toy.  Studio guest Jim Jefferies then joined, sharing baby pictures and discussing the challenges and humorous aspects of parenthood, including graphic anecdotes involving his child's excrement.  Jefferies then discussed his show *Legit*, recounting offensive and graphic anecdotes from filming involving interactions with disabled actors.

The show continued with more conversation with Jim Jefferies, who recounted anecdotes about a bizarre co-worker and his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, including crude comments about Jessica Simpson's post-pregnancy physique.  The discussion also covered gun control, Jefferies' anti-gun stance, and a negative Twitter interaction. He shared personal stories about attending (and mistakenly attending the wrong) Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings, struggles with infidelity since becoming a father, and his relationship with his girlfriend and her religious mother.  He outlined his strategy for avoiding marriage.  A representative from Meatball Obsession promoted National Meatball Day, leading to racist remarks from the owner regarding his grandmother's views on Asians.  Jefferies also recounted meeting the man who shot Osama Bin Laden.  Terrence Howard then joined, promoting *Dead Man Down*, contributing to the show's already established tone of crude humor and anecdotes. The conversation touched on Howard's experiences filming *Crash*, his marital problems, and further off-color jokes. The segment closed with more discussion of *Dead Man Down*, a humorous story about a dog humping a child, a digression on *The Wizard of Oz*, and Jefferies' experiences at a Little People's Convention, including observations about dwarf porn stars.

The final segments opened with a crude joke about the hosts' infidelity and a vulgar discussion about sex.  Jefferies shared childhood anecdotes and details about his therapy sessions.  Howard continued to discuss *Dead Man Down*. Tommy Davidson made a brief, unannounced appearance. The latter half focused on the hosts’ "Elevator Show" and future plans, including potential guests like David Lee Roth and the *Star Trek* cast.  They brainstormed ideas, many sexually suggestive, and promoted sponsors like Dollar Shave Club.  The discussion included planning future "Elevator Show" episodes and arguments about who deserved credit for ideas.  The broadcast concluded with promotional announcements.  A final segment attempted to persuade Eric Nagel to host "Toon Time with Eric Nagel," a cartoon-focused show.  Despite cajoling and insults, Eric refused.  The segment included a listener call about 90s cartoons, mention of Roger Rabbit memorabilia, and promotion of a host's upcoming live appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Bean!  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  All right.  Wow.  It's Friday.  Good morning, everyone.  Thank God.  It's Friday, I say. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Thank God.  Holy macaroni.  I was...  It's snowing, right?  Apparently so here in the Northeast.  I always feel weird doing the local weather because we got fucking people all over the  world.  Yeah.  I hear from people all over the world now.  Every day.  But people are so concerned what's happening in our lives, Opie.  You think?  That anything.  Weather.  How our drive was.  You know, for a little chilly.  They care. 
[00:01:00]  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Man.  I was sort of telling Anthony about my day yesterday.  I had one of the weirdest days yesterday.  First Bueller type or...  It was a little, um...  It was a little First Bueller.  It was a little, um...  Hangover.  The first one.  Oh, right.  Okay.  It was a little, uh...  Home Alone.  Oh.  Home Alone.  And, uh...  That almost covers it all. 
[00:01:30]  I had a really strange day.  Any Chucky?  Oh, absolutely a little Chucky.  A little Chucky.  Yeah, that knows a little bit what happened.  Yeah, you combine those four movies.  That was kind of my day yesterday.  Somehow, I decided to relapse.  Yeah.  Not...  I mean, not drugs and alcohol.  I'm talking about being sick.  Yeah.  I took Monday and Tuesday off, even though people still think I was faking being sick,  because last Friday, I pulled a gag where I did a fake cough and said, man, I'm not feeling 
[00:02:00]  good.  I might have to take a day next week.  You did fake cough.  I mean, when you said you weren't coming in, I texted you back, all right, wink, wink,  in parentheses.  But, I mean, to break it down, break it down, and pull back a wall.  I actually faked cough, because I actually was starting to feel a little strange.  Mm-hmm.  So, I don't know.  I'm a goofball at times, so what the fuck?  What you gonna do?  What the fuck?  So, I don't even know where to begin with yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  My whole house is sick, okay?  Yeah.  I can tell you that much.  I have an upper respiratory infection, and I'm extremely congested, and I got a horrendous  sinus headache.  Have you ever had sinus headaches?  They're terrible.  Horrendous.  Yeah.  That's what...  I mean, like, my left eye, I'm kind of closing, because the light hurts.  Oh, man.  So, I got that.  My wife's got bronchitis.  She ain't got time for that bronchitis.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that. 
[00:03:00]  Lord, it's a fire.  It's a fire.  I got bronchitis.  Bronchitis.  Also, one of the top baby names in Harlem.  Bronchitis.  That's right.  Fun fact.  Fun fact.  Bronchitis.  So, she's got bronchitis.  We got a five-month-old at home.  So, she's still breastfeeding.  Yeah.  Making it kind of strange to go on antibiotics.  Now, you're not allowed...  Doctors say you can't do that shit?  Oh, dude, man.  That was part of my day.  Oh, man. 
[00:03:30]  That was part of my day, trying to convince her to take the antibiotics, because she's  not getting better.  Bronchitis is like...  It's one of those motherfuckers.  It doesn't really get better quickly.  It could eventually.  It's a medicide.  She got the Z-Pak.  She went to the doctor.  You got a low-level bronchitis thing happening.  Here's your Z-Pak.  It'll take care of it.  You take the Z-Pak.  It goes away right away, right?  I love those Z-Paks.  Anyone got any, by the way?  But now, she's got to breastfeed, so she can't get well within a couple of days. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And then my son, who's almost three, he's on penicillin and Benadryl.  Holy shit.  Because he's got a double ear infection.  Dude, we're walking around our house.  That's crazy.  I know that I love the hell out of my wife, because I so understand why people lose their  fucking minds and just walk out.  Really?  Yeah, because we're all walking around going, please, you step up. 
[00:04:30]  And I'm thinking, no, you step up.  And I try to step up.  Then she tries to step up.  But we're all fucking sick.  You've got to get that three-month-old to step up and fucking start taking care of the house.  Exactly.  She's the most sane one in the house right now.  So, I guess the day started with me going to the dentist.  So, you got the back history here.  We're all fucking sick.  I think I made that perfectly clear.  Just a fucking plague house.  Yeah.  I do want to promote Tylenol sinus. 
[00:05:00]  Aspirin.  It's amazing.  Because an hour ago, I was telling Ann, I'm like, I don't think I could do a show today.  The fucking sinus pressure I was feeling, I'm like, I can't do it.  I popped a couple of those.  It's going away.  Nice.  Yeah.  And I've been on that shit for three or four days now.  So, I go to the dentist because, if you remember, I broke a tooth eating hummus.  Right.  Right.  The hummus broke your tooth.  You're having a hell of a week.  That's when we last left you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's when I was really sick. 
[00:05:30]  Like, you know, homesick, not working.  And I didn't want to eat anything.  And I was eating hummus.  And next thing I know, I thought there was a pit in my hummus.  It was my tooth.  You break your tooth.  A third of my tooth.  Oh, my God.  One of my molars in the back.  Literally falling apart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, it's kind of like, like I said, a sinkhole.  Yeah.  It's bad.  A piece just fell out of your tooth.  So, I go to the dentist, finally, for a cleaning.  And then it turns out, the dentist goes, you haven't been here in over a year. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, I was here four months ago.  She looked at my charts.  Yeah.  That's what happens when you become a father.  You just lose track of time like that.  I swear to God, I thought four months was a year and, actually, it's a year and three  months since the last time I had a cleaning, which is crazy because I like getting  cleanings every six months.  Right.  Okay.  So, I sit down and I get the old cleaning and the lady's like, man, your teeth look  great except for that, you know, tooth that's all broken.  My gums look good.  The cleaning went well.  But all that vibrating and shit. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  That was driving my head nuts, too.  The sinus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're nodding at this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like when they're cleaning your teeth and it just starts shaking your head.  Is that what I was, that's what I was telling my wife.  I'm like, I think, yeah, I think they were rattling my brain.  Every dental instrument sucks.  It just sucks.  Jesus.  I hate it.  It rattles your head.  I hate it.  And then I got a hygienist that has to, like, comment as she goes along.  You drink enough water because you've got a lot of plaque. 
[00:07:00]  Rub it in.  Thank you.  She goes, uh...  That's what I was gunning for.  But, I mean, in the end, you know, the x-rays look great and my gums themselves are nice  and pink.  But she had a comment.  Drink enough water because that's what, you know, makes plaque build up even more if you're  not, you know, hydrated.  Poor brother.  Then she goes, you brush your tongue?  I'm like, yes, I brush my tongue.  Who doesn't in this day and age?  Of course I brush my tongue.  How do you think I get the wine stains off of it? 
[00:07:30]  My case, coffee.  And then she goes, you got the electric toothbrush?  I go, yeah.  She goes, but you only use it once a day, right?  I go, no.  She goes, I told you once a day.  What, are you having an argument with that?  Yes, I'm like, hey, I haven't even been here in a year and three months.  How do you remember what you told me a year and three months ago?  But supposedly, I guess the new thing is electric toothbrush once a day and then you have to  go old school.  Manual, yeah.  Well, because I got a couple of crookeds. 
[00:08:00]  And what?  What happens?  You got to get in there at a different angle?  Yeah, I got a couple of crookeds.  Crackers.  Bottom teeth.  Bottom teeth.  That happened.  Pointed out by the haters.  Thank you for that.  I really appreciate it.  And then.  I think you weren't aware of it before.  No, I wasn't aware of it.  That's right.  Yeah.  And then you look up these idiots and they're like way worse than I ever been.  And then she goes, you know how you can get those crooked teeth fixed with the, she's  fucking commenting about everything wrong with me.  She really is fucking with you.  You should just be, hey, your tits are small. 
[00:08:30]  Just fucking, hey, your ass is fat.  And then she goes, ah, I see you growing a beard.  Which means, oh my God, shave that fucking thing.  What a busy body.  Holy fuck.  Yeesh.  Unless you're telling them about her niece or nephew that's seven and who's a whiny cry  baby.  Oh.  Took, took the kid to Mary Poppins and they had to leave because the kid was all freaked  out by the dancing on the ceiling or something.  Sounds like me.  Like we just cleaned my fucking teeth.  All these hygienists want to be their own little autobiographers.  They don't want to write books.  Everybody, they think, like, it's the same thing with my hygienist. 
[00:09:00]  You go and she's saying, how's the apartment?  And they remember every detail of your life.  The problem is you can't talk back.  Of course.  She was asking me all sorts of questions and my mouth was wide open.  I can't talk back.  So I was like.  Yeah.  What a dumb concept.  They talk to you and they got fucking instruments in your mouth.  I don't mind the talking, but you can't ask me questions that I can't answer at this  moment in time.  So then, uh, so then, um, the dentist comes in and he takes a look at the, the broken 
[00:09:30]  tooth.  He goes, this is just a little air, a little air.  And he, that air.  Yeah.  It made my headache worse.  Fucking hit a nerve, right?  Is that what happened?  Probably.  Very sensitive to temperature and the moving air.  Holy fuck.  So.  Wow.  Yeah.  I hate that.  He goes, you know, you could, we could, we could either kind of fill it in.  Uh, that'll be temporary.  Eventually it'll, you know, be a problem.  Again, or we could just take care of it right, right here, right here in the dentist, right  here in the dentist office.  And we can get you a, we'll get you a crown on your head. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  That's nice.  The crown of thorns.  Imagine you just walk out and you're like, Ooh, you tip that fucking crown.  Go.  I got a crown.  Makes the toothache feel much better.  Cause you're walking around like a king and people are looking at you.  You forget that you have a toothache.  I wouldn't mind that.  Retard.  And then he's like, you have a dental insurance.  I don't even know.  Do we?  I don't think, uh, we don't, right.  I don't think we have a dental plan.  I know people out there are simply amazed by what I just said.  I really don't know.  Many people don't have dental insurance. 
[00:10:30]  It's not like an insurance, like a typical thing.  Right.  Yeah.  Dental insurance plans don't really take care of a lot of stuff, to be honest with you.  Right.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  So a lot of people don't really have them.  So I got, I got to go out of pocket, 1200 fucking beaners for my crown.  There you go.  I got, uh, right on my phone.  100 Mexicans.  Right, right on the phone to Bob.  I go, Bob, I need a crown.  Do I have dental?  He goes, I'm looking into it.  Oh boy.  He never got back to me.  Of course not.  Your agent won't even tell you who you have dental in the house. 
[00:11:00]  He said, I'm looking into it.  I don't think we do.  I'm like, well, hurry up.  I got a fucking broken tooth.  I think we did under AFTRA because like, uh, yeah, I think we did, but we're not with  AFTRA anymore.  Yeah, but they merged with the other people.  SAG?  Yeah.  Maybe the SAG's got the doctor.  I don't think our SAG, um, uh, we, we've put in enough SAG hours to, uh, rate.  Do you go and, uh, get your teeth clean and shit?  Who's you go?  Huh?  Yeah.  It's all out of pocket.  It's all out of pocket, right? 
[00:11:30]  All out of pocket.  Son of a bitch.  Imagine with insurance, anything besides the cleaning.  You're writing checks.  I'm the worst.  He's got a crown.  Yeah.  I like the crown.  Yeah.  So, ah, so I, so I go, all right, let's get, let's get this crown, uh, done.  He goes, oh, no, not today.  Why?  Well, you got something better to do.  He goes, oh, no, not today.  Yeah.  I go, why?  He goes, I'm, I'm flying to Thailand tonight.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  I asked.  Literally, oh, boy.  Because it's our bit.  Uh-huh.  It's our bit.  I asked.  What the fuck are you doing going there? 
[00:12:00]  I asked.  Because I was very suspicious.  Because I don't want one of those dentists.  Yeah.  Is he a humanitarian doing dental work over there?  He's got three kids.  He said his, uh, his, uh, mother-in-law's flying from L.A. to watch the kids.  Three little ones.  All under the age of, uh, 10, I believe.  Sure.  And him, and this is what I was waiting for.  He goes, me?  And I'm like, uh-oh.  Huh?  And my wife for going to Thailand.  Ah.  Ah.  And then I asked some questions.  It was very shady.  Yeah.  Where are you going?  What are you doing? 
[00:12:30]  Eh, we're going to go here and there.  What the fuck is Thailand about?  We're going to Bangkok.  Uh-huh.  Bangkok's about Thailand, right?  You know what fucking Thailand's about.  We all know.  No one goes there for anything but fucking perverted sex.  Yeah.  Lady boys.  Lady boys.  That's what we've said over the years.  Lady boys, uh, fucking, uh, the women that work in those clubs where they shoot darts  out of straws in their pussy and pop balloons.  Mm-hmm.  I'd like to see that.  We've seen it.  Who wouldn't?  I just don't want to be part of the whole lady boy thing.  You don't want the guy that's putting his fingers in your mouth doing it, though?  True.  Going to Thailand? 
[00:13:00]  True.  He's not touching anything clean over there.  So he goes, yeah, I can't do your crown.  I'm flying to Thailand.  I'm like, when are you going to be back?  He goes, ah, like a week and a half.  Maybe.  So then I got an appointment for three weeks.  Three weeks.  So you got to go around with this fucking hole in your tooth?  And it's starting to fucking hurt.  Yeah.  It didn't hurt the first couple days.  It starts exposing that nerve.  Is that what's going on?  That's some nerve.  Yeah.  So he's going to Thailand.  My dentist.  16-hour flight.  I'm like, nice.  First class?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:13:30]  Nope.  Business class?  Nope.  He goes, coach?  He's going, coach, 16 hours.  I'm like, fuck, I guess you're not doing well as a dentist.  He should have done your crown, pocketed the cash, and used it for fucking first class.  But he's going on at Emirates, I guess, supposedly.  Oh.  Emirates coach is even good.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  So then I walked back to my apartment, and my sinus pressure, my toothache, just fucking  hurting, man.  So then I go back in the house. 
[00:14:00]  But now you're home, where you can relax and forget your worries about your sinus.  No.  No.  No.  The homestead is very dangerous right now.  A little stressful?  A little stressful.  I can't believe we're all sick.  Because when you have a family, one gets, Mars knows, he's shaking his head.  Usually one gets sick, and you're like, all right, I got to step up.  I'm the one that's sick.  But when everyone is sick, you just keep looking at each other like, help me.  No one's there.  Help me.  No one's there to help.  So then I go home, and my kid is starting to feel better. 
[00:14:30]  So he's like, his energy is back.  So he's fucking rocking around the apartment.  He wants to be outside.  And I'm sure it's all good, constructive stuff that helps the family that's ill.  Not shit you have to mind 24 hours a day.  There's got to be a worst-case scenario when the whole house is sick, and the kid is the one that gets better first.  When I'm 100% healthy, it's a pain in the neck to chase him around all day.  Imagine when your bones are achy, and you've got a sinus headache, and you can't breathe. 
[00:15:00]  And every time you go up an elevator, you can't hear for 15 minutes.  Oh, my gosh.  Because whatever the fuck happens to your ears when you're all clogged up.  That's what happens when you live in Cloud City.  Cloud City, baby.  That's it.  So all of a sudden, I don't know.  Like, the kid's got the run of the place, because I can't.  I just can't.  And my wife can't.  And somehow he got into the chocolate bars.  What?  So now he's on a sugar high. 
[00:15:30]  A three-year-old on a sugar high in a fucking house where everyone's sick.  Yeah.  Somehow he got into the chocolate bars, because I heard some yelling from the other room.  He got into the chocolate bars.  I'm like, all right.  How much could he have had?  I guess he had a lot.  Because then...  Like, fucking Beavis.  Yeah.  For the next six hours, he was completely out of his mind.  Oh, my God.  Completely.  It's like having a little Coke head in the house.  Well, that's right.  I said to you before the show, I don't do it anymore.  I did it a long time ago.  I dabbled a little bit. 
[00:16:00]  But I was looking at him going, that's someone on Coke.  He's grinding his teeth, just talking nonsense.  He was talking nonsense.  For real.  Like, just babbling about weird shit.  Yeah.  And then he went through all his toys within an hour.  Like, he would play with something for five seconds.  And just fucking lose interest, run around, grab something else.  Kids' attention span is very short to begin with.  But when they're on the chocolate, forget it.  On the chocolate.  On the chocolate. 
[00:16:30]  It's a drug.  That's a drug.  Absolutely.  For kids, that's a fucking drug.  And a kid not even three yet?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And then, you know, then I'm talking to my wife, get on the antibiotics, because she  sounds horrible with the bronchitis.  She won't go on the fucking antibiotics, because she's the breastfeeding, because that'll  be a nightmare, doing bottle feeding, blah, blah, blah.  So then she goes, I'm going to this alternative medicine guy.  Alternative medicine.  That was suggested to her by a friend of hers. 
[00:17:00]  Shaman?  Oh, no.  Shaman.  I was one of those in EverQuest.  Yeah.  You were?  It was very cool.  Yeah.  I was able to cast healing spells and fucking all kinds of buffs.  It was cool as fuck.  So it was, she decides she has to go to this guy, and, you know, he'll help.  And she got acupuncture, but they don't take insurance, so it was like, $500 fucking  dollars.  Insurance company laughs at the people.  $500.  Even though she has the $10 copay antibiotics right there. 
[00:17:30]  Holy shit.  I'm like, holy fuck.  All right.  Whatever you got to do.  Wow.  You know, whatever.  And then, you know, long story short there, the guy wants her to come back three days  a week for the next, you know, two or three weeks.  Of course he does.  Of course he does.  Does this happen every day?  No, no.  This is a daily account.  No, this was a weird fucking day, man.  Because now I'm sitting there like, we're just going to, that's like throwing, I've had  acupuncture.  It's kind of cool. 
[00:18:00]  Like, it'll relax and stuff, but I don't know how that's going to fix the bronchitis.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe someone could explain that.  I'm kind of old school with stuff like that.  Right.  You need some shit that's been researched by, you know, Merck and Company.  Well, that Eastern medicine, supposedly.  Pfizer.  Yeah.  You need fucking Pfizer.  No, Pfizer is because we got lazy as a country.  Well.  I mean, Eastern medicine has been proven to take care of a thing or two.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So then, now I'm trying to do research on my own, breastfeeding, Z-Pak, bronchitis. 
[00:18:30]  So now I'm like, now I'm writing Dr. Steve who's on vacation in the Dominican Republic.  What's he looking for, a left-hander?  What's he doing?  So he calls me back on Skype.  He Skypes you?  He Skypes me.  It's like the future.  Sure.  Horrendous connection.  And then he tells me there's no Wi-Fi and the cell service and this and that.  He goes, so I might be able to talk to her for 17 seconds.  So through like, I hear, I have no idea what he's saying, but I think he said that she could 
[00:19:00]  be on the Z-Pak.  Yeah.  So she's gone for like two or three hours of the acupuncture.  My kid is now completely wired on the chocolate.  And I just said, I just decide, you know what?  Fucking do whatever you want.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm achy.  My tooth fucking hurts.  So I sit on the couch and I'm like, you know what?  The Islanders and Rangers are on.  Ooh.  I'm going to fucking put that on my 65-inch TV.  What?  Nice.  And that's about the time my kid decided to break out his T-ball set. 
[00:19:30]  Aw.  Oh.  He's got a little plastic T-ball set.  Aw.  And he's like, watch, Daddy, watch.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I got my laptop on my knees.  I'm checking my numbers.  We all check our numbers, right?  Check some tweets.  Check some YouTube views.  Check Facebook.  Check the Instagram.  And he's doing pretty well with that T-ball thing.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, we taught him to keep his eye on the ball. 
[00:20:00]  So I have a video, but I just don't want my kids in the public eye.  Yeah.  We told him to keep his eye on the ball.  So what he does is he puts the ball on the T.  Yeah.  And then he leans all the way down and puts his right eye on the ball.  Hello, bull.  He's like, ah, that's adorable.  Leans all the way down like this, puts his eye on the ball, and then he's ready to swing.  So he, literal.  He does it every time?  Every time. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Eye on the ball.  Kids just don't understand literal shit.  Oh, literal kid.  Right.  If you say eye on the ball, he's going to listen to you and go, all right, if that's what you say makes me a better hitter, I'm going to fucking put my eye on the ball.  There you go.  So he's hitting, and I'm like, wow, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm playing with him a little bit, but not really because I feel like shit.  He's wired.  I'm like, I have officially given up.  And this T-ball is going on in the living room.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Literally.  I hate to use the word literally, but feet away from my five-month-old.  I literally use it all the time. 
[00:21:00]  Five-month-old.  I was going to ask what's going on with the five-month-old while this is happening.  It's not good enough that he's just playing T-ball in the living room.  He has decided he needs to do it right next to my five-month-old daughter.  I mean, right next to her.  She's in a little bassinet.  Oh, boy.  A couple of the balls ended up in the bassinet.  Oh, no.  But I'm like, I can't control this kid.  He's on drugs right now, a.k.a. chocolate.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  But all of a sudden, I look up to check out the Islanders-Rangers game, and my TV is like black. 
[00:21:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  But I could still hear the game.  So it was on BET?  What happened?  Sounds like a nightmare.  Tony in Brooklyn saying, fatherhood is a young man's game.  I'm kind of figuring that out.  A young man's game.  Kind of figuring that out.  Yeah.  So I look up at the 65-inch TV where the nice hockey game was on, and all of a sudden, there's no picture.  I'm like, fuck.  And this happens from time to time, so I'm fucking doing a few things, trying to figure it out. 
[00:22:00]  Settings.  Yeah.  Settings.  Can't figure it out.  So I'm like, fuck it.  So now I'm listening to the game like it's old-school radio.  Oh, you still have sound coming out.  I throw a 65-inch TV.  I can't see the fucking picture.  What you could get with a fucking little radio.  Right.  So at this point, my wife comes home.  She's like, I don't know what he did.  I did acupuncture, but I don't know if it's helping me.  It's $500.  He wants me to come back three times a week.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Please just take the antibiotics.  Please. 
[00:22:30]  Because I need you healthy.  Three times for $500?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he wants me to come back.  She was totally cool.  She's like, I can't come back.  I can't do that.  That's crazy.  Damn.  Yeah, those guys that don't accept insurance or the insurance doesn't accept their practice,  they've got to lower their prices if they want fucking customers.  So I go, could you just please fix the TV?  I just want to watch the game.  Because she kind of knows some workarounds, I guess.  Yeah.  And I just don't.  So she's working on it, working on it, working on it. 
[00:23:00]  Next thing, no, I'm in the other room at this point.  I hear kind of, not a scream, but like, ah, something like that, right?  So I come running into the living room, and that's when she pointed out that my 65-inch  TV was spidered.  Somewhere in my fucking, my cloud of fuzziness, he fucking smacked the ball, and he missed  the 65-inch TV.  You missed a good line shot up the middle?  I missed a good fucking hit.  I missed a good hit.  He connected?  And fucking spidered my TV. 
[00:23:30]  Then it's high!  Then it's fine!  Then it's gone!  So now I'm like, oh, my TV?  And the people that, you know, our parents out there, they've told me off and on on Twitter  and shit, have you had a, you know, have you lost any of your shit yet?  I've been really lucky.  It's not like a wiffle ball?  Well, or, he's got all sorts of balls, all sorts of different sizes, and there is  this one yellow, yellow, like, uh...  Croquet ball. 
[00:24:00]  It's almost.  Oh, shit.  It's hard.  It's a hard yellow ball that's hollow, and it has, like, a thing inside that kind of,  you know...  Jingle jingles?  Jingle jingly.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the ball was used for, but I guess he put that on there.  Breaking TVs, apparently.  Right.  And it fucking connected.  Oh, shit.  Line drive right to the TV.  Oh, man.  Fuck.  So the TV shot.  65-inch TV gone.  There's no fixing those.  There isn't, right?  You don't get those fixed.  No.  So I'm just...  At least you could upgrade now to fucking, like, an 80. 
[00:24:30]  My day's not over yet.  It's still...  It's not over yet.  So at that point...  If this was a daily day...  If I filmed this, I would compete with Hangover.  This would be a good documentary.  Yeah, what...  And it should be called Fatherhood is for the Young.  Oh, my gosh.  So then...  A young man's game.  Your day should be played for sex ed classes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do not have sex.  See what happens to you.  Eesh.  And so then, my left eye at this point, I'm kind of closing it because of fucking... 
[00:25:00]  Everything just aches.  I'm like, I gotta get out of the house.  You can close your eyes because it's not like you can watch the TV.  Right.  So you can just relax.  You have to imagine.  So I, you know, I'm going downstairs because we had a fax something.  And we used to have a printer, but that went a while ago when the kid decided he has to  stand on it a lot.  They just are little tornadoes in your house.  Little tiny tornadoes.  We lost that about a year ago. 
[00:25:30]  I just never replaced it.  So if I need to send a fax or something, I just go downstairs and have that shit.  So my kid goes, I want to go with you, daddy.  I'm like, no, man.  Dad needs to just breathe.  A minute away.  Yeah.  So I locked the door.  And then with my key, I locked the top lock as well.  Because he's getting pretty good leaving the apartment.  You gotta fucking put him in a little solitary.  Yeah.  So I make sure and I do the double lock.  And I hear him like getting all bummed out.  He can't go with daddy. 
[00:26:00]  And I hear him run away, all bummed out.  I'm still ridiculously wired on the chocolate.  Yeah.  So then I go downstairs.  I'm faxing.  I'm socializing a little bit.  Just chilling out.  Spend some time with some adults.  Right.  And all of a sudden, the lady at the desk goes, it's your wife.  But I hear first, what?  That's what the lady downstairs is.  I hear her side.  She goes, what?  Oh, no.  So I grab it.  It's my wife on the phone calling downstairs.  What's going on?  She goes, I don't like saying his name on the air. 
[00:26:30]  Blank is in the elevators.  Oh, no.  He's in the elevators.  Your kid?  My kid is in the elevator.  Your kid's in the elevator.  So he got...  She said she heard the door open because we figured all this out later.  He will go in the hall a little bit but come back in.  Oh, boy.  But we sort of watch it.  We're not just assuming it's okay.  Oh, boy.  And then she said that she heard the elevator.  And was like, no.  No fucking way. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, he got it.  So she ran out in the hall immediately, of course.  And wants to see the doors close.  With an almost three-year-old in the elevator by himself.  Holy shit.  How many floors is your building?  50.  50.  So it's a 50 to one shot.  And we're way up there.  We're way up.  Oh, man.  We're almost at the top.  He unlocked all the locks with his little hands?  Yeah, because he now pushes, like, whatever he could find to get up higher.  Oh, so he's climbing on stuff. 
[00:27:30]  He's a smart...  A lot of people say he's a pretty smart kid for his age.  I don't know.  Yeah, look at this here.  Booger couch saying, your kid's ripping off your fucking internet show.  Yeah, there's an elevator show for him.  Yeah, yeah.  So he pushed a box to open up the top lock, which we've seen him do.  Holy shit.  And it's not an easy lock, man.  It's kind of heavy duty.  So he used fucking some ingenuity there.  Yes.  Pushed it up.  Yes.  Hopped on the fucking...  And I'm downstairs.  And all of a sudden, you know, the wife's like, he's in the elevators. 
[00:28:00]  I'm like, what?  He's in the elevators?  Oh, my God.  So I'm...  So you can see where the elevators are.  And I'm like, all right, where are the elevators?  This is exhausting.  One was on 18 and one was on...  I'm trying to...  I don't know, like 30, let's say.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, okay.  I go, call security.  And security goes, yeah, no one's in the elevators because they could see.  Oh, man.  So now he got in the elevator on our floor and now he got off on a floor somewhere in my 
[00:28:30]  building.  So you don't...  Now you don't know where he is?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  No.  So I'm like, all right, I'll...  Get me to the 18th floor and then I'll just, like, I'll run the stairs until I fucking  find him.  Right.  You know?  And then just as I was about to do that, this lady calls down and goes, we have a kid  up here on, I think it was like 24, I guess.  24?  I'm like, what?  How'd he get to 24?  I'm in the 40s. 
[00:29:00]  One of those fucking buttons.  I'm in the 40s.  He hit a button, door open, walked out.  I'm in the 40s.  Wow.  He barely knows how to push the buttons because I don't...  I tell him not to.  So his whole thing was, he was trying to follow me down.  So I go up to the 24th floor and I'm coming out of, like, the service elevator and I hear  down the hall, it's okay, it's okay, daddy's coming, daddy's coming.  Oh, was he losing his fucking mind?  Oh, yeah.  So then I kind of run around the corner and see my kid pretty fucking freaked out and  scared, crying.  Was he happy to see you? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then the lady...  The lady, I was thinking of Bill Burr because she had her apartment door open.  Her husband was kind of peeking out the door.  She was in the hallway with my son.  And my son obviously needed comforting, but she wouldn't touch him.  Yeah.  Because, you know...  It's the day and age we live in.  Yeah, it's the Bill Burr thing.  You don't fucking even feel that.  Bill Burr has a great bit about that.  You can't touch kids nowadays at all.  So she's trying to comfort him without really touching him. 
[00:30:00]  In the old days, he would have, like...  The father, like the man of the family, would have had the kid, like, in his arm going,  There, there.  Oh, here's your daddy.  You know, a little fucking hat on his head.  Yeah, you know, the police scenario.  Yeah, yeah.  The ice cream coat and the cop's hat on his head.  Nowadays, like, don't touch him.  Right.  Holy shit!  But I saw that go down in person.  She understands the society we live in.  Yeah.  The world we live in.  And she's about a foot or two from him, but trying to calm him.  Like, her hands are out and stuff.  She wants to kind of hold him.  Gotta block him like a basketball player. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Just gotta fucking...  So I grab him, and I'm like, oh my god, thank you so much.  I'm so sorry you had to deal with this.  And she's like, no, it's cool.  I was just trying to keep him calm, because he was really, really upset.  Jesus.  So then, you know, we go back up to the apartment, and of course, you know, any mom's going through  this, when the son is now presented back to you, she's gonna kind of break down a little  bit.  So she got a little emotional there?  Of course. 
[00:31:00]  A little emotional.  So then we asked the kid what happened, you know?  He goes, I wanted to follow daddy.  I got on the elevator, I pushed five buttons.  He pushed five buttons.  He kept saying that.  I pushed five buttons.  I pushed five buttons.  Because that's what you do.  And then I got out, and then I'm going, mommy, mommy, help me.  Help me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You can only imagine the emotion that would start on.  So the wife must have fucking just lost it at that point. 
[00:31:30]  Mommy, help me.  Mommy, help me.  Daddy, daddy, help me.  Help me.  And he's conveying this story to you guys.  And he's close to 20 stories below where I live.  Oh, no.  Saying this.  He was saying, mom.  See, he doesn't understand the concept of an elevator.  He thinks you go in, you get out, and you're still kind of on the same floor.  It's magic.  Right.  The door opens.  You're magically somewhere else.  But if you're in the elevator, and he thinks, I think he thinks there's only one place to go,  which technically it is, because we only use the elevator. 
[00:32:00]  It's called where daddy is.  Right.  I want to, I push five buttons.  I go to where daddy is.  Yeah.  You go in the elevator, you push a button, and you're downstairs.  Yeah.  He doesn't understand the concept that you could possibly stop somewhere else.  Where daddy isn't.  Right.  Because he just thinks, all right, go in the elevator, push any button, and you're right.  Like, that's the where daddy is, button.  The daddy buttons.  Right.  But no, he was 20 stories below us.  So, in the middle of our building.  How many buttons did he push?  He said five.  Five buttons.  Over and over again, he said five.  Whatever that means to a kid, you need to push five buttons when you're going into an elevator. 
[00:32:30]  He's like, Jesse, you don't understand.  I did it right.  I pushed five buttons.  Five buttons.  I pushed five buttons.  That's what you do.  I'm not an asshole.  Yeah.  And then it's a little, like, kind of, still sort of a baby voice going, man.  I wish I could imitate my kid better, but basically, yeah.  And then I got out and was like, Mommy, help me.  Mommy, help me.  Oh, my God.  That's the saddest thing.  A mom never wants to hear that.  No.  Daddy, help me.  Help me.  Of course. 
[00:33:00]  She feels like she failed the kid in some way.  The kid has to say, Mommy, help me, and Mommy's not there.  I kept yelling.  And she had no idea.  Right.  I kept yelling, Mommy, Mommy, Daddy, Daddy.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Which makes it even worse.  Terrible.  He's only in a diaper and a T-shirt.  And dressed like Daddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, basically.  And he brought, for his little adventure, his three favorite toys.  So he's just holding on to his three favorite toys.  He's holding on to his three favorite toys, 20-plus fucking floors below where we live, 
[00:33:30]  in a hallway.  Holy fuck.  Grabbing those fucking toys like it's everything.  Oh, man.  I'm like, oh, my God.  In case he's got to barter for food and shelter later.  He's got some fucking money.  Some kid money.  And that's, uh...  Oh, my God.  So then we kind of got everyone calm and ate dinner.  I woke up with this horrendous sinus headache, and here I am.  I think that's it. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  It was a weird day, man.  We don't have days like this ever.  That's constant, like, having something to do.  I don't like days where you constantly have something to do.  I need some downtime, and I don't fucking even have a little family.  I don't even know what downtime is anymore.  It's magnificent.  I don't know what it is anymore.  Love it.  And the downtime just got destroyed, because the minute there is downtime, let me flip  on the T.  Ah, the old TVO. 
[00:34:30]  You should have made a list.  We love lists on this show.  That's terrible.  All the things that happened.  What an awful little day.  But I'm amazed that I started thinking that, I mean, when you're a parent and your kids start,  you know, developing and getting older, like, you have to change all the stuff you know  as reality with them.  Does that make sense?  Yep.  Like, there was a time, oh, he's not going to open up any drawers or any of that stuff,  so we don't have to worry about that.  Then all of a sudden, you've got to get the childproof shit. 
[00:35:00]  But you get the childproof shit low, because you're like, ah, he doesn't really climb yet.  Then all of a sudden, you go, oh, okay, he's climbing now, so now we've got to take care  of this.  Yeah.  And I was just at the stage going, man, he's getting a little too comfortable with that  front door.  He would open it and stuff, but he was too scared to kind of go out.  So, and you can see the door from where I sit on the couch, you know?  I'm like, all right, you know, let him do that.  But I started thinking in my head, we've got to update what we know about this kid, and  now we've got to really start worrying about him leaving the house and working the elevator, 
[00:35:30]  because he's been, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he's been starting to push buttons  and stuff on his own.  Like, that had no interest to him.  I would laugh my ass off if I was in an elevator and just saw a kid in diapers and t-shirt with  his toys, get in and start pressing buttons.  Right.  That would be the funniest fucking thing to actually, to see.  I want to...  Where you going, work?  Yeah.  Where you going?  I want to look at the security cameras, because New York City, there's a lot of fucking assholes  that live here.  A lot. 
[00:36:00]  A lot of assholes that live in my building.  I want to know.  I mean, as funny as what you just said, I want to know if there was actually people in  the elevator with the little kid, and they just didn't want to be bothered.  Right, right.  Like, a lot of us don't want to be bothered with shit.  Sure.  But I will guarantee you this.  If I'm in an elevator and there's a little kid in diapers, I have to get involved.  You've got to be like, where are you going?  I have to.  Daddy.  There's other things you'll look the other way, like, ah, someone else will take care  of it.  But something like that, I would have to step up.  You've got to.  You've got to say something.  So I'm really curious.  I wonder if, like, he was in there, you know... 
[00:36:30]  You'd have to go down to the lobby and at least dump him off on the fucking...  Something.  Like, the people, the guards at the lobby in front of the door.  Yeah.  If you put him there, then everything's cool.  You know, then they call up and, you know, they know...  He's sitting on the desk with a little cop hat and an ice cream cone.  Waiting for the parents to come running, running, uh, downstairs and...  Daddy B, is this your aunt, child?  Hi, here he is.  Yeah.  Having an ice cream cone, don't you know?  And then I went to bed at 11 and, uh, this stupid size headache woke me up at 3.30. 
[00:37:00]  And then I was about to call you.  I'm like, dude, I had the craziest day and I don't...  I can't work today.  You were going to fucking just, uh, take a powder for the day.  But the Tylenol sinus is kicking in and I feel much better.  Goddamn.  Shit.  That's, uh, fucking funny, man.  Holy shit.  That's...  See, that's the shit that I can't even fucking relate to.  No.  It's funny as fuck, but I am out of that loop.  I just...  That's why listening to it is like, you're living it, so you're like, Jesus Christ, I gotta 
[00:37:30]  do that.  But I'm just like, that's fucking...  And I really do love being a father.  But man, you get some of those days where it's like one thing after another.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you'll go weeks, months, maybe even a year with nothing really happening.  And then one...  You'll get one of those days where it's like, you gotta be kidding me.  All in one day?  And I had one of those days yesterday.  Action movie days.  Yeah.  Shit's just going down.  So I got a fucking dentist in Thailand. 
[00:38:00]  I still got a fucking broken tooth.  You got a doctor in fucking Dominican Republic.  Yeah, Dr. Steve was fucking calling me on Skype, and I have no idea what he was trying  to tell me.  He wrote a...  And then he writes, there's one resort here that might meet your specifications.  I'm like, I don't give a fuck about resorts in the Dominican Republic.  I feel like I could think of a thousand other places to go to a resort other than the Dominican 
[00:38:30]  Republic.  Right.  Ain't going.  What's the list, Sam?  You put together a quick list?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tell me if I'm missing anything.  All right.  All right.  Dentist makes comments about Opie's plaque and beard.  Yeah.  Opie can't get his crown until three weeks from now because the dentist is going to Bangkok.  Yes.  Oh, man.  The teeth cleaning horribly vibrated his sinus headache.  Yes.  Just rattled my brain.  The whole house is sick, except the kid is getting better.  Dr. Steve tried to help from Thailand on... 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, hey.  Oh, there's a Freudian slip.  Wow.  I bet you Dr. Steve would rather be in Thailand than the Dominican Republic.  Thailand.  Dr. Steve tried to help from DR on Skype, but failed.  Well, he didn't really fail, but it was a pain in the ass.  Uh, the kid got into the chocolate and became all coked out.  Yes.  That was a six...  I mean, when you have candy around the house, and I'll tell you this, like...  I do.  You do handle it like the old days with your Coke. 
[00:39:30]  Like, when are we going to fucking, you know, fucking do this?  And with a kid, you're like, all right, what time is it?  Nah, nah, it's too late.  We can't.  We can't.  And it's, like, very valuable.  Dude, I know exactly...  Very valuable.  I know because I have fucking...  There's candy all over my fucking house.  And, like, some days when, uh, when school's, uh, when school's out, my trainer comes over.  Right.  He's got to bring his three boys over.  And they're varying ages, but they're, like, young.  And they're constantly...  Like, the first thing they know when they come over is to fucking rush the candy jars. 
[00:40:00]  Go find it.  They know.  And then, and then Pat, my trainer, is going like, no.  Right.  No, you can't.  And I'm just like, I don't understand.  Like, I watch and I go, the kid wants candy.  You just give him fucking candy.  Oh, man, you have no idea.  And then, and then the two bins in my fridge are full of soda.  Right.  There's Coke.  Oh, my God, no.  So they want Coke and candy to just, like, fucking...  And Pat's like, no, don't touch it.  Yes.  And I'm like, and they come up to me, they go, Anthony, can I have some?  And I'm like, sure, go ahead, grab whatever you want. 
[00:40:30]  Like, I don't give a shit.  They're leaving in an hour.  It makes them little addicts.  Yeah.  It's the same mentality.  They search it out.  Yeah.  Oh, they know where it is.  And then when they get it, I mean, you know, my kid is already sneaking chocolate into his  room a little bit here and there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then my buddy, my buddy, my buddy Vinny comes over with his daughters and his wife  and stuff, and they out and out lie.  They're like, they eat candy from downstairs.  Right.  And then they come upstairs and go, can I have some candy? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  And Vinny would be like, wait a minute, I heard you, you were eating candy downstairs.  No.  You're fucking, what are you talking about?  They're like a good addict.  They're like addicts.  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta, you gotta put aside a couple hours if one of these little fuckers is gonna  get into the candy.  Get into the candy.  Did you see the video of the sprinkles kid?  No.  Like a couple weeks ago?  No.  Oh, that one's hilarious.  Yeah, sprinkles all over his face.  And it's like, did you eat the sprinkles? 
[00:41:30]  No.  Right.  It's like your little fucking, it's like watching first 48 of kids.  Yeah.  They're just lying in the interrogation room.  All right, so the kid got.  I didn't do nothing.  Uh-uh.  The kid got into the chocolate and became all coked out for six hours.  He ate a lot of chocolate, because six hours is a long time for a kid to be wired.  Look, we know you got into the candy.  We just want to know how it happened.  Now, you can help yourself here just by telling us, because we know you got into the candy.  So, is there a reason why did you get into the candy? 
[00:42:00]  I didn't eat any candy.  Oh, look, your friend's in the other room, and he told us you ate the candy.  Jesus Christ.  The kid decided the living room next to the five-month-old is the best spot for T-Ball.  Like, moved it inches away from a bassinet.  Yeah, and after a while, I was like, all right, if you got to hit the ball in that spot, just go for it.  Because it does, like, the bassinet kind of dips down a little bit.  So, I think that was good enough protection. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, you had your precautions in order.  And then the five-month-old just laughs and smiles, like, thinks it's the coolest thing ever.  As dangerous inches away from her head.  They just don't know.  They just don't know is right.  The kid hit a home run directly into the television spiderwebbing it.  Yes.  And I try to get a good picture of it.  It's not an impressive spiderweb, but it certainly did the job.  Usually, you still get that spiderwebby picture, though.  This ball was hard. 
[00:43:00]  It was hard, man.  It's a small spiderweb.  It's about the size of a softball, I guess, spread out.  Oh, boy.  Done.  I just got that TV, too.  That TV's not even a year old.  Oh, Sam.  That's painful.  It could have been yours.  If it was a few years old, whatever.  I actually didn't really like the TV, anyway.  Too much glare.  Oh.  Too much glare.  Well, good.  Obi had to fax something, and so he left. 
[00:43:30]  Then the kid got up on a box, unlocked the door, got into the elevator, pushed five buttons,  and ended up somewhere else.  And then finally, Obi found his kid on the 24th floor.  He had been shouting for his mommy and daddy to help him.  To help him.  Help me.  Oh, that's so sad.  I don't know.  I wasn't really worried.  I feel like my building's safe and stuff.  I wasn't worried. 
[00:44:00]  Your wife was really like...  Yeah, of course.  And I don't blame her.  Yeah.  I think she might be a little mad that I wasn't as worried as she was.  Really?  Maybe.  I don't know.  No, but the mother is...  That's different, man.  Like, a dad will be like, ah, little kid, fucking out the elevator, what are you going  to do?  A mother's like, ah!  Ah!  He's losing it.  I knew he was fine.  I guess my biggest concern was, like, you know, keeping him calm.  Yeah.  Which these people absolutely did.  So I'll send them something today.  I gave my mom one of those once.  I gave my mom a fucking freak out once. 
[00:44:30]  Really?  At the grocery store.  Yeah, because I wanted one of those little balsa wood airplanes.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the ones that came in the plastic package.  And then you slide the wing through, you slide the tail, and you stick the little rudder  thing in the back.  I didn't have the patience to put those together right.  I broke so many of them.  Gotta watch.  Those wings are very fragile.  You gotta slide it through there.  Yeah, but I had one of those.  I had gotten one.  I was like, mommy, mommy, mommy, I want it.  She finally was like, okay.  So, of course, I don't put it in the little basket. 
[00:45:00]  I hold it.  And as she's shopping, I decided it was time to play with my fucking toy and walk home.  So I just walked out of the supermarket and just started walking down the street, walking  home.  How old were you?  I was probably fucking...  It's one of my very, very first memories ever in my life.  So it's four or five, probably, right?  So it's probably four, yeah.  So I'm just walking home, holding my little airplane, and I didn't know where I was going.  I just decided when you leave the store and walk, eventually you get home. 
[00:45:30]  That's what happens.  It's like the five-button thing.  It takes you to daddy.  You walk.  Five buttons means daddy.  Yeah, you walk, you go home.  So the next thing I know, I'm just walking down the street, and my mom comes running up  to me crying.  I mean, why did you live in?  Like, freaking out.  And then I'm like, man!  I start losing it.  I'm just...  It makes it worse for the kid.  A minute ago, I was just going home, I'm playing with my fucking airplane.  But I can't blame any mom for doing that, but it definitely makes it worse for the kid. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She freaked out.  Right.  I was so panicky.  I got lost in a grocery store once when I was like five, except I never left the grocery  store.  Oh.  Like, I ran ahead of my mom to get something, and then I went back to where she was,  and I couldn't find her.  That's because she fucking was trying to lose you.  She was just trying to get in the car.  Oh, boy, good, he's gone.  But I started, I looked down the aisle, and then I looked down the next aisle, and I  didn't see her.  So I just burst into tears, and just started crying in the middle of the grocery store.  It was like I told you before. 
[00:46:30]  I had seen E.T., and I was petrified of being left behind.  Oh, no, you were going to be left behind like E.T.  Right.  And some lady, I guess you could still do it back then.  And some lady just saw me crying, and asked me if I was lost, and I went, oh, yes.  And she picked me up, and brought me, and put me on top of like the customer service counter.  Yeah.  And the lady goes, what's your name?  And I go, Sam.  Sam.  Stupid little Sam.  I'll never forget.  Aw.  Over the grocery store, PA system, the lady had to go. 
[00:47:00]  And now when you're older, you see the women who work these PA systems, and you're like,  oh, this is the woman.  That's the one that was saving me.  She was saving me.  I'll be back with mommy.  The announcement goes, ladies and gentlemen, there's a Q-tip here that needs to be lost  as mommy.  Will Sam's mommy please come to customer service?  Oh, wow.  He's wearing a Ninja Turtles T-shirt.  And my mom just walked over, but she wasn't like upset. 
[00:47:30]  She was like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't even leave the store.  Will E-Rock's wife please come to get him?  He's wearing a Ninja Turtles T-shirt.  E-Rock, you ever get lost?  Yeah, but I wasn't crying.  I used to hide in the clothing racks when my mom would go to clothing stores, those big  circular ones.  Oh, yes.  So I used to crawl into the middle and just sit where the metal would cross.  Yeah, it was a great little fucking fort.  Yeah, like a little clubhouse. 
[00:48:00]  And then when people would, you know, come and go through the rack, I was just like,  hi.  Oof.  But I would take off.  I'd be like, ew.  Some lady picked up E-Rock because he was crying, but she threw her back out.  Oh, no.  E-Rock comment.  That's terrible.  They always leave the fat kids behind.  Low E-Rock.  The pedos never go for the fat kids.  No way.  Oh, that's horrible.  E-Rock could have been in a mall all by himself all afternoon.  It would have been fine.  No one's taking me. 
[00:48:30]  Sorry.  No one wants me.  I'm playing Jim's role today.  Fat joke immediately followed with, sorry, I didn't say it.  Sorry.  Didn't mean it, but obligated to say it.  My brother got lost in France one time.  Whoa.  Really?  Yeah.  How do you get on a plane?  These little world travelers.  Right.  We lived in England, so it wasn't that big of a deal to go to France.  Oh, fucking rich kid.  To take the tunnel?  Did you take the tunnel?  No, the tunnel wasn't invented yet.  What?  Child of the fucking 90s. 
[00:49:00]  We built the tunnel right after we left.  We had to take a boat.  A boat.  A boat.  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah.  So they took a speedboat down there.  So he probably got on a boat by himself?  No, we were in France.  Oh, you guys all made it to France.  But my dad lost him on the streets of France, and my dad was just freaking out because he  knew, like, if he had to tell my mom that he had lost my brother on the sidewalk in  France, how much trouble he'd be in.  Did you see England?  Did I see England?  Yeah.  I saw England.  Did you see France? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I saw France.  Did you see your brother's underpants?  Ah, shit.  You fell for it.  Dumb.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Wow, in France.  Yeah, and in fact, my dad just had to start, like, panically walking up and down the streets  going, Casey!  Casey!  I would check the Eiffel Tower first.  Yeah?  Just because it's like, you know, everyone knows it.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  And that's where, like, in a movie, the kid would be.  Well, I mean, we weren't in Paris, but I guess we could have gotten on a train. 
[00:50:00]  You'd go like, oh, Sacré-Bus!  Oh!  He would be sitting on a French policeman's desk with a little French policeman hat on, a fucking  foreign legion hat, singing Frere Jacques.  Eating a croissant.  Eating a croissant.  Instead of an ice cream cone.  A croissant.  What's wrong with those people?  Eiffel Tower is, like, 200 miles away.  How the hell?  What the hell?  How the fuck did you get into the Eiffel Tower?  Yeah.  Oh, it was in Paris.  Okay.  That's all I know.  But my kid being 20-plus stories below where he lives, that's like an adult going to New 
[00:50:30]  York and getting lost in Boston, probably.  That's a long distance, yeah.  That's a major long distance for that kid.  But yeah, I mean, he just realized, he probably now has this realization that when the elevator  door opens, if you get off at the wrong time, you're lost forever.  There's no daddy.  Right.  Like, you could easily never come back.  Because it's really interesting to watch how these guys think.  Yeah.  Like Ant said, in his little mind, you go in the elevator, you push five buttons, and daddy 
[00:51:00]  appears.  Daddy went in the elevator.  Right.  So if you go in, you pop out and, hey, there's daddy.  Right.  It's amazing.  He doesn't know there's fucking 50 other options.  Right.  There's 49 other places where daddy ain't.  Right.  You probably learned on the grocery store day from your mom screaming at you that if you  start walking, you might not be home.  It might not be home.  It's not as easy as just starting to walk.  Just walk.  Yeah.  Because when I walk with mommy, I get home.  Right.  So I'm just walking. 
[00:51:30]  Just like I am.  And then you realize, I need this woman.  Yeah, the woman is the common denominator between walking and home.  Right.  Now I get it.  I gotta get a bolt, a dead bolt.  Yeah.  Put it up high now.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you gotta start doing that shit.  Shit.  Or just tie your kid up to something in the house all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  Hide the chocolate.  Shackle them.  We don't have a lot of chocolate in the house, but he found it, man.  They love that shit.  He found it.  One of those big fucking chocolate bars. 
[00:52:00]  The fancy ones.  The good shit.  Oh, it was a big chocolate bar?  Was he just eating the whole thing?  Covered in chocolate?  I don't even know where.  Jesus.  I mean, that's how out of it I was for an hour or two, though.  Yeah.  I don't even know where he ate it.  That house.  That fucking mad house you're in.  That's like, this is like the training day of parenting.  Like the most unbelievable day of training day.  It's all as true as I just said it, too.  I didn't fabricate it.  And when you do a radio show, I hate to break down a wall. 
[00:52:30]  You do fabricate shit.  A little bit.  You gotta pump it up.  You gotta pump it up, as they call it in the biz.  I didn't fabricate this at all.  Because then there are times you come in here and you know you don't have to fabricate anything.  No.  It is what it is.  It's just a day in the life.  Holy fuck.  It was a weird day.  Yeah.  Fuck.  And your kid yelled at you.  She just, chess, not checkers.  So, just a break.  Yeah, I guess our grub here, I just saw Chris out there. 
[00:53:00]  I guess Jimmy's, where's Jimmy?  Jimmy is in Charlotte.  Charlotte.  At the Funny Bone.  Horseman country.  Yeah.  Charlotte.  Make sure you check out Jimmy at the Funny Bone in Charlotte.  Yes.  Go down there.  I like seeing pictures that come back from Jimmy when he's there.  Like, a lot of the fans take pictures.  It's like, oh, it's almost, you almost feel like you were there.  Yeah, it's like.  Oh, there's some fans with Jimmy.  Checking out faraway lawns.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there's a common connection.  Right.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, it is cool.  Yeah.  I see the fan shots and stuff.  I always debrief, debrief Kenny. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  About Jimmy's trips.  How'd it go?  Well, how were the fans?  So, the flight was delayed.  He starts with, like, the trip to the airport.  You get the entire thing.  A good debriefing.  It's every negative thing that happens.  Oh, of course.  Yes, flight was delayed.  Then the aircraft didn't have a seat that went back for me.  And then, all right, gloom and doom.  And my latest episode of the elevator show, my goofy show, is available. 
[00:54:00]  It's my favorite episode.  Why?  Well, because of The Miz.  The Miz is awesome.  Let's push it out there to the wrestling fans.  He's got WWE's The Miz in the elevator with Troy Kwan's bad sunburn.  Was The Miz always a well-dressed, well-groomed guy?  Is that, like, his angle?  Not always.  No?  But now he's making money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, like, I do wonder.  I was looking at The Miz, and he was talking about living in L.A.  And he had all these nice clothes on.  He's going to...  I hope he doesn't spend all his money. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, you think he might...  Because, like, you see these guys.  Like, Ric Flair, he's got no money.  He's got no money.  But does The Miz still have heat?  Yeah, he's still a big guy.  He's still one of the majors?  He's still making money.  Oh, man.  But he's spending a lot of it on clothes.  Oh, Jesus.  And a lot of it on...  He's living the life.  Living out in L.A.  Living the life out in L.A.  And he's getting married to this hot chick.  Her ring is ridiculous.  Oh, no.  And she's got to have ridiculous tastes.  Very expensive tastes.  Wow.  Oh, man. 
[00:55:00]  Me and Ant never went down that road.  Cool dirt road.  Look at how we dress.  Right, like slobs.  It's unbelievable how bad it is.  I dress like a militia man.  That's the trick.  It is a trick.  Never stop being a dirt bag.  Cheap clothes.  Free clothes.  Rockstar.  I'm wearing Rockstar.  Who are you wearing?  Rockstar Games.  But Dad always said, live below your means.  That's the trick.  Way below.  That's up to the individual. 
[00:55:30]  But he's like, always live below your means.  What I don't spend in clothes, I spend on toys.  Much rather.  I have fun.  Dress very poorly.  It's my whole game.  Nice.  Yeah.  I dress very poorly and have this tiny TV.  You want a broken 65 inch?  No.  You can't fix that shit, right?  I don't know.  That would be too much of a fucking hassle, I think.  I never even hear about people taking their TV to a TV repairman. 
[00:56:00]  Like the old days.  It just doesn't happen anymore.  Yeah, that business is done.  If your TV breaks, you fucking get a new one.  That's pretty much the game.  Yeah, my dad's the only one I know that legitimately tries to fix TVs.  Oh, really?  Fixing TVs went out with the fucking, like, the picture tube and the tubes.  And that's it.  Yeah, because usually you just replace the tubes is most of the problems, right?  Yeah.  The old TVs used to have a chassis. 
[00:56:30]  Pull out the chassis.  Chassis.  Yeah, I didn't know this.  And they'd pull out the chassis, and then there'd be modular pieces that the TV repairman would pop a module out, pop it back in, then push in the chassis.  But now it's a flat screen.  I don't even know how you would get into a thing.  It doesn't look like it has an inside to it.  There's a screen in the back.  TVs are two-dimensional now.  They have height and width and no depth.  There's nothing to get into.  It's a miracle.  So you just throw them away and buy a new one.  Someone out there right now is dialing the phone. 
[00:57:00]  I'll explain it.  I could explain it.  And then another guy would be like, that guy's full of shit.  Yeah, my dad, because he doesn't like buying things, so he found it.  No shit, Sam.  Yeah, I know.  And guess who inherited that fucking quality?  He's thrifty.  But he found it illegal.  It's slipping like a hundred bucks.  And he'll open the TV up, flat screen, and do whatever he does to it.  It's amazing how it's done.  Don't fall in your dad's footsteps with that shit. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know.  Even when I was poor, I made sure I had some shit.  You got to enjoy yourself a little bit.  And that wife of yours will dump your ass in a second if she thinks she's not getting what she can be getting.  True.  You know, you better fucking at least be spending a little on the princess.  Spend a little.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  On fucking the Robert's princess.  We got a pizza last night.  I was like, Jess, I got this.  Damn.  A pizza. 
[00:58:00]  Pizza guy comes to the door.  Yeah.  17.05.  Slipping by 20.  He goes to his pocket.  I go like this.  Keep it.  Wow.  Then I look at Jess and give her the wink.  Like, look at me.  It's nothing.  All right.  All right.  She starts singing, Hey, Big Spender.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got all aroused.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Because the delivery guy is a guy with a real job.  Yeah.  Ooh, look at this guy.  Delivering pizza.  The delivery guy.  Yeah.  So really, The Miz is your favorite episode? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just because of the fact it's a wrestler?  I love The Miz.  I like The Miz, too.  He's a good guy.  But also, watching Troy get smacked in his chest.  Always fun.  Yes.  He just gave away the punchline.  Oh, shit.  I mean, people are going to figure it out.  He just gave away the punchline.  Spoiler alert.  Spoiler alert.  It's a minute and a half long.  Jesus.  All right.  Maybe something else was going to happen.  Maybe it does.  Fuck.  Stay tuned to the end.  Don't worry, dude.  Sam just gave away the punchline.  These videos, they're quick, and I try for a little punchline at the end.  You get your hit even if they turn it off halfway through. 
[00:59:00]  It's all good.  The best part is when a little kid walks in in his diapers and a t-shirt and presses five buttons.  And his three favorite toys.  It's amazing.  My YouTube channel is Zopi Radio.  It's the first video.  Just go there and fucking help me out.  God damn it.  Please.  View my elevator show.  It's goofy and stupid.  Help me, listeners.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And I kept calling, Mommy, Daddy, help me.  Oh, my goodness.  That's heartbreaking.  I'm looking at the kid like, that is just not the right thing to say right now. 
[00:59:30]  Eek.  We're going to have to have a conversation soon.  Eek.  And I just kept over and over again.  Mommy, Daddy, Mommy, Daddy.  And he kept telling you how he said it over and over again?  Because then he knows he's getting a reaction.  Right, right.  Kids love when they get a little reaction.  Oh, boy.  It's like, oh, okay, this is working.  I'm going to say it another ten times.  I'm talking on their heartstrings.  Did he get in trouble for all that stuff?  Or was it more like, oh, any disciplinary action?  Yes.  That's a weird, yeah, put you in a weird spot.  We didn't do.  Because you've got to make him know that that's not, that shit ain't going to wash. 
[01:00:00]  We were pretty stern with him.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Ah, don't go in the elevator.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  We were pretty stern about it.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  We didn't give him a time out or anything.  Yeah.  He was an emotional wreck for an almost three-year-old.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That's like coming home from a car wreck as an adult.  You're just like, oh, I don't want to, oh, I'm shaking.  That's like coming back from the NOM.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, yeah.  He's got the fucking thousand-yard stare.  Well, for a kid, it's like a three-yard stare.  Right.  That's all they need. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Poor little kid.  Yeah, let's eat some grub.  We've got Jim Jeffries coming in at 830, our old pal, who's now a big star for FX.  Big star.  Very happy for him.  Legit.  We'll catch up with him.  It's been a while.  And Terrence Howard coming in.  Ooh, a big star.  Big stars.  And he's in one of the movies that's doing okay, review-wise.  Excuse me.  That Oz movie is a bomb.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Is it called Journey to Oz or whatever the fuck it's called?  Yeah.  Yeah, a great powerful Oz movie. 
[01:01:00]  It's getting zero stars.  I just can't.  And it's one of those epic-looking films and zero stars.  James Franco, to me, will ruin any movie.  Like, I see his name in there, and I'm just like, nope, that guy can't carry a movie.  Got one that's worse.  Who?  Paul Rudd.  You hate Paul Rudd.  Paul Rudd is in another movie playing Paul Rudd.  He really is only Paul Rudd.  I don't know why Hollywood keeps throwing him in movies.  Girls love Paul Rudd, dude.  Maybe that's it.  But he plays Paul Rudd. 
[01:01:30]  He's the king of the rom-com.  Girls think he's, like, funny.  He's not funny.  And cute, charming.  I'm obsessed with how bad he is.  They love his humor.  He was good in Anchorman, right?  He was good in a couple things here, I guess.  Well, Anchorman's kind of an ensemble, though.  Someone's saying Comedy Zone for Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Did we get the plug wrong?  Jesus.  I don't know.  He's in Charlotte.  Go to his website.  Go to his shitty webpage.  Yeah, that he pitches about.  He'll find out.  Yeah.  Let me make sure I get the plug right.  30 years ago, was Reagan calling the Soviet Union the evil empire? 
[01:02:00]  Really?  The evil empire.  He's at the Comedy Zone in Charlotte.  I don't know if it's in Charlotte.  North Carolina.  It is Charlotte.  I fucked it up.  Okay, so Norton's at the Comedy Zone in Charlotte all this weekend.  Woo!  Go see him.  You'll have a great time.  Guaranteed.  Ew.  James Franco is delicious.  Izzy.  Izzy, you muzzy.  Who's saying that?  Enough.  Some Arab chick.  Delicious?  Fucking drag head. 
[01:02:30]  That's why those guys continue to get work in Hollywood.  Girls like him.  Girls love delicious actors.  Yeah, yeah.  Actors.  Yeah, don't think.  Do you see the trailer for Hangover 3?  No, they're not.  Yeah, dude.  It's coming out soon, too.  All right.  After the break, could you please punch it up?  I'll give you the entire break to find it.  Did you hear the after show yesterday?  I stayed in the city yesterday.  I wasn't able to listen.  You talked about the trailer?  No.  No, he talked about fucking being able to find the clip. 
[01:03:00]  I found that clip.  An hour late?  Not an hour late.  I found it as soon as Daryl Hammond walked out of the room, and it was ridiculously difficult.  A minute late or an hour late, it was after the show was over.  Sorry.  Time's up.  I love Daryl Hammond.  That was the first time I met him.  What a fucking...  He is intense, though.  And then the interview was over.  He just kind of walked off.  Yeah, he did.  He walked out.  Most guys don't just walk off.  And I don't think...  He didn't have an issue with us or anything.  That's just Daryl Hammond.  I never thought...  He just kind of walked off. 
[01:03:30]  ...watching SNL that he was that nutty.  Wow.  Because, you know, we have a little small talk after the mics go off.  Thank you.  Playful banter.  Yeah, thanks for coming in.  And I was going to relate to him a little bit and tell him some more how much I really  enjoyed his book.  And, man, before we could even, like, get out of our seats, he just walked off.  Yeah.  And I know he didn't have an issue with us.  I'm going to say that again.  I was trying to stop him just to tell him I found the clip.  I found the clip.  Right.  Please.  Man, he's intense, though.  Yeah, he is.  He's incredibly talented.  Has had an amazing professional life. 
[01:04:00]  He's at Carolines all weekend.  Yes.  Carolines.  Has met three presidents, but, man, he's intense.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Four presidents.  Four presidents.  Bush, Bush, Clinton, Obama.  That's right.  True.  What do you got there, Roland?  Roland has...  I like when Roland comes in with gifts.  No, just a documentary.  I didn't give you one.  Was it?  Which one is it?  237.  Oh, 237.  On The Chining.  I know.  I haven't watched it yet.  What is The Chining?  The Chining.  The Chining. 
[01:04:30]  Is it a documentary on The Chining?  Hispanics call it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About the conspiracies and the hidden meanings.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  I haven't seen it yet, but I want to.  And while we're plugging things...  Oh.  Elevator show?  Somebody's got...  Damn it!  ...their own show this weekend.  Oh, Roland's got the food show.  The food show.  I saw that.  You ready for this?  Yeah, the chefs are coming in.  How many hours do you got to do?  One.  One hour?  What chefs?  David Burke.  Oh, it's? 
[01:05:00]  Oh, no.  He owns a townhouse.  Oh, okay.  It's a different guy.  Iron Chef Michael Simon.  Mm-hmm.  Randy Gerber.  Aw.  He makes a tequila.  He makes baby food.  No, he makes tequila with George Clooney.  Oh, sorry.  He makes tequila with George Clooney?  Yeah.  Oh, he's married to Cindy Crawford.  Yeah.  See, I know some of this shit.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And Samar McAllis, she has a...  She's one of the top vegetarian chefs.  Ugh.  You're going to ask him what Cindy Crawford's like in the sack?  Nice.  No.  Nice, right?  Nice. 
[01:05:30]  Nice.  I was kissing that mole.  Oh, jeez.  And today's special guest...  Hair's grown out of it at this point.  Come on that mole.  Oh, is it meatball day?  Meatball day.  Meatball day!  Fucking rock.  Rock, those things are great.  Close to nine.  God damn it.  I want them now.  Come on, man.  But I want it now.  It's snowing.  No?  It's snowing.  So?  It's snowing.  The meatballs get through in the snow.  Yeah, but...  When's gravy day?  We can make gravy day any day.  Let's make gravy day next week.  All right.  Meatballs today, gravy next week. 
[01:06:00]  I can make donut day, sandwich day.  Chili day, hot tamale.  Oh, I can make chili day.  Weather forecast.  Chili day?  I can make that happen, yeah.  You better hurry up.  Hey, is it daylight savings time tomorrow?  This weekend.  This weekend.  Yeah.  How is that possible?  Let us spring ahead.  They go real early with this now, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Thank God.  When did that start?  A couple years ago?  I think so.  Yeah, a couple years ago they decided.  Seems a little too early for it.  I'm happy, but...  Huh.  I love it.  Absolutely.  Get this fucking...  Stays lighter out later. 
[01:06:30]  Wait, you're right around the corner from getting your pool opened.  April 1st I opened my pool.  I know you do.  Ooh, first day baseball.  April 1st I opened my pool.  Oh, by the way, I did get text from Debbie.  So did I.  And I was cordially invited to opening day.  Yes.  That's what I'm doing because I love Debbie.  So the whole show is going to opening day?  What?  The whole show is going to opening day?  Or at least all the hosts? 
[01:07:00]  Blow me!  You're not going anywhere, my friend.  Well, you didn't help out for this Yankee extravaganza.  Team's going to suck this year, so it doesn't matter.  They're going to be bad.  Oh, it's going to be a bad year.  Me and Debbie are working on our issues.  Hey, Debbie.  She wrote, Yankee game, isn't this great?  Remember I just wrote, how you doing out of nowhere?  Even though it's been three or four months since the last time I texted her.  She writes, wow, what did I do to deserve a text from Greg O.B. Hughes? 
[01:07:30]  And then she plays right into it.  She goes, I'm getting ready for baseball season.  Want to come out?  Give me some Legends tickets.  You won't regret it.  Then she writes, you said on the air I didn't send you a baby gift.  You are still...  Oh, shit.  You're arguing with the fucking golden goose.  She goes, you said I didn't send you a baby gift that you're still waiting for?  Millions of people now think I'm an ass.  But I told her...  Give her the big bag of all the stuff.  I told her I didn't say that.  I said it's some of our asshole listeners trying to cause problems. 
[01:08:00]  Anthony Comea for Yankees, Red Sox, and little brother.  You did say that.  Yeah?  What?  That she didn't give me a gift?  You said she might not have given you a gift.  Oh.  Debbie's an angel.  Yeah, that wasn't...  We loved Debbie.  That was you.  Debbie rules.  We just gotta work out our issues.  We'll be back.  We'll be back in good terms.  You also announced she was listed in your phone as free tickets.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  I mean, it's just...  When she texts me, it comes up, Debbie.  You're like, ah, Debbie. 
[01:08:30]  But, I mean, Debbie.  That could be anybody.  No, because when you know that Debbie is a wonderful woman that also has tickets to the Yankee game,  then when Debbie comes up, you know it's Debbie.  You don't have to put free tickets.  She's by far the most important Debbie in my life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's like if your mom calls.  Instead of mom, you put, ah, womb I came out of.  You know, you go fucking...  That kind of makes sense.  Or come hold her.  Let's put it this way.  Jesus.  Well, that's Travis. 
[01:09:00]  What?  Wow.  What did Travis do here?  No, he's like his mom.  Roland is just fucking out of control.  He's all revved up for me, Paul, so I understand.  I understand.  I am too.  We'll let you slide.  But, I mean, if you have a phone, right, and all of a sudden you get the urge, like,  you know what, I want to go to a baseball game as that lady.  But you should know that she's so nice.  I'm going to put her in as free tickets.  The problem is you don't remember her name.  No, not really.  She's not important to you.  Yeah.  Well, free tickets is important. 
[01:09:30]  That's a good name to have in the phone.  For you, but it's unkind.  Not really, because she doesn't know that.  Well, she does.  She listens to the show every day.  Oh, yeah.  She's a fan, too, which is, you know, she's a big fan of the show.  Yeah.  That's great.  She's less of a fan and more of a supporter, really.  Yes.  I was just mad that she put me in the second row.  I'm like, come on.  Second row.  How about we do the first row?  Oh, my God.  It's right there.  You're not making it easier?  Right there.  Right down the first baseline. 
[01:10:00]  I'm like, first row, I could put my fucking beer and a little food right up there on the ledge.  I was able to watch fucking A-Rod strike out from so close.  It was wonderful.  Really?  Yeah.  And it got better seats.  Roland, how's Debbie going to feel about it?  I don't know.  I love Debbie.  I love Debbie.  Fucking walks me right past everybody.  Debbie, love Gil.  He just had a baby.  She walks us past all the people waiting online at the Legends Club for dinner and stuff.  It's fucking fantastic. 
[01:10:30]  Fantastic.  She makes shit happen.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  All right.  So we've accomplished a lot here in the first hour or so.  Certainly did.  When we get back, we got Justin Bieber fucking collapsing.  What happened there?  You're going to find out some fucking drug shit with this kid.  That's my...  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  This kid is finally getting into the drugs.  He's on the Leif Garrett track right now.  Exactly.  That's where he's going.  Exactly.  Not Justin Timberlake.  You're not fucking around, do you think?  Not Justin Timberlake.  Yeah, I absolutely think he is headed...  Some shit's going down.  Leif Garrett, not JT. 
[01:11:00]  He's starting to see his popularity going down a little bit, and he's seeing other people  coming up, and he's not as relevant anymore in this big pop community.  And he's looking like more of an asshole.  And when he does, nobody is anymore saying, oh, he looks so cool.  They're saying, look, he looks like an asshole.  They booed him in London.  Well, because he was late.  Two hours.  Someone had a funny tweet about that.  One of our comedian friends.  Basically is saying, you know, they waited four hours for Guns N' Roses. 
[01:11:30]  What's the big fucking deal?  Stupid kids can't wait two hours for Justin Bieber?  Oh, boy.  Of course, the tweet was way funnier.  It was kind of funny.  I just told it without any of the humor.  That pesky humor that went along with it.  Oh, God.  I knew halfway through.  It made me chuckle.  It could have been the cold medicine.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:12:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  To ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire,  to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding,  and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil,  I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support  for our efforts, this administration's efforts, to keep America strong and free  while we negotiate the real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear arsonists 
[01:12:30]  and one day, with God's help, their total elimination.  Yes.  Yes.  That was ten years ago today.  Ten years.  Man, that flew.  Man, long years ago today.  That fucking flew.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  What the fuck?  Ten years ago.  I don't think he was that fucking like that.  Ten years ago, man.  Absolutely.  Was he?  Child of the 80s shit right here.  Yeah.  This could be like one of your six-month dentist time-lapse things. 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  Yeah, how do I think four to six months is actually a year and three months?  You were off by almost an entire year.  Yeah.  I was off by nine-plus months.  The evil empire.  Yes.  Will.  Yeah, those were the days, huh?  It's fucking Soviet Union.  Actually, there's a bigger anniversary today.  Oh.  Beavis and Butthead.  Whoa.  A little show called Beavis and Butthead.  Oh, boy. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think I want to know, but I think I know.  20 years ago today, Beavis and Butthead was introduced to the world.  Jeez.  20 years ago today.  God damn it.  That would be, what, 1993.  Wow.  93.  I do recall that.  Friends of mine going like, you've got to fucking see this.  It's hilarious.  I was just out of college.  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  I started to feel a little old, but then I found that Beavis and Butthead.  I'm like, look, man.  Class of 93, man.  Class of, well.  Huh?  I might have padded a little bit.  Oh, a little?  A little bit.  How old are you guys?  91-ish.  I wasn't allowed.  91-ish.  I wasn't allowed to watch Beavis and Butthead when it first came out.  Really?  I was a little boy.  No, you weren't.  It's like nine.  You're like 40.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You wish I was 40.  Why would I wish?  Because then there wouldn't be such a gap for me to poke fun at.  There's a gap in your head. 
[01:14:30]  You're only, what, 10 years behind us?  10, 12 years behind us?  Oh, my God.  Tops?  29.  Yeah, that's about right.  10, 12?  Yeah, that's about right.  About there?  That's about right.  You hope to be as fucking wonderful and irresponsible as me and my age.  You live an amazing life.  It's crazy.  Fucking insanity.  No way.  It's just a fucking, fucking fantasy world.  It is.  Stupid.  It's stupid fun, right?  It's Peter Pan, but for like a criminal child. 
[01:15:00]  Thank you.  Yes.  Peter Pan.  It's the place Pinocchio goes.  Oh.  Remember when you go to the bad place?  I forget what it's called.  My house.  Yeah.  Compound.  Yeah, yeah.  It's called The Compound.  It's called The Compound.  Yeah.  Oh, we got the trailer.  Ain't wanting to see the trailer for The Hangover.  Because I can't imagine, after watching The Hangover 1.  Right.  Which was funny.  They lost me with two because they decided to do the same exact fucking movie.  Same movie.  Holy mackerel.  Now, yeah, but did you expect that Tyson cameo at the end with the singing? 
[01:15:30]  And then, now three.  Are we looking at something a little different?  A little bit.  It is.  All right.  Let's.  They're changing it up a little bit.  All right.  Let's see how they.  For Hangover Part 3.  How they do Hangover 3.  It's the official trailer now online with Bradley Cooper.  Bradley Cooper.  He has to be pissed.  I bet they're giving him a lot of money to do this.  I'll tell you what happened here.  He signed up for maybe a three movie deal. 
[01:16:00]  Didn't realize.  Didn't realize.  Fuck, I'm an Oscar almost winner.  Big star.  An Oscar nominated actor now.  He doesn't want to be in Hangover movies anymore.  No.  This contract was signed well before Silver Linings Playbook picked up.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  So now he's got to do that nonsense again.  It's just a little indie movie.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Here's the Hangover 3.  The official trailer.  Looks terrific.  It's full screening. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, boy.  They're at a funeral.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  At the cemetery.  I hope somebody integral.  It's got the voice of an angel.  It's breathtaking.  Ah!  Ah, it's Zach singing.  Ah, that's...  Whatever the fuck his character is.  I didn't expect that.  Oh, here comes the trailer music.  Oh, here comes the trailer music and...  Vegas!  Oh, thank God.  Back to Vegas.  Back to Vegas?  I told myself...  It all ends.  I'll never come back. 
[01:17:00]  Don't worry.  It all ends tonight.  Pause.  Someone needs to...  Let's break this down.  Why would you ever go back to Vegas after what happened to you the first time?  Right.  What kind of trickery are they using in this movie where they're like, oh, Vegas again?  What do you think?  I don't know.  Someone gave him a Jedi mind meld and made him go back to Vegas.  But they're going to have some kind of nonsense storyline where like, okay, I know we almost  all died and shit, but yeah, all right.  Let's go back to Vegas.  Maybe they had to go.  Maybe something happened and they have to go. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah?  You think that's it?  Maybe not going would be worse than going.  Oh, that little twist.  I also like that the fourth one, that like in the first movie they were looking for and  the second movie was getting married.  They just have to keep thinking of excuses for him not to be hanging out with those guys  because he's not that funny.  Which guy?  Remember like in the first one they were looking for him?  Yeah.  And then the second one he was getting married?  Like he's supposed to be the fourth friend, but they have to keep finding excuses for  him not to be involved in the hijinks.  Is he the one that came in here? 
[01:18:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  He was a bore.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  But he was kind of a bore.  Nice enough guy.  But Justin Bartha, he's playing a homosexual character on NBC's New Normal.  Oh, well, E-Rock wanted to get that out quickly.  One of your favorite shows there, Mr. Rock?  Comment?  He's partners with the guy from Book of Mormon.  I was about to say that.  All right.  The very talented guy from Book of Mormon.  He's actually really funny.  Yes.  He's on Girls and on that show.  Yeah, he's going to have an amazing career. 
[01:18:30]  Watch that fucking chubby fucking flat-titted fatso fuck.  She loves getting naked.  She loves taking her fucking clothes off and showing that horrid, uh, you know, body.  And we don't love looking at it.  Every episode.  It's horrendous.  No.  Every episode, the thing comes up before that says there's going to be nudity.  And you go, ooh, nudity.  I wonder which one it's going to be.  I hope it's that girl or that one.  No.  And then it's fucking Lena.  Lena Dunham again.  Every time.  Again.  She's a pig. 
[01:19:00]  She, when she hikes her legs up in the air and she's getting fucked, it's like, why am I  watching this?  Like, you know, when you see a girl naked, you can always find something.  Yeah.  I can't find anything.  No.  She's changing the way we look at women.  No, she's not.  Is that what it is?  I believe so.  I think it's political.  That's what the feminists like to say out there.  They certainly do.  You know something?  She's showing that a woman's body doesn't have to be this perfect.  Yeah, and I don't have to look at it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How about make sure it doesn't look like a fucking pear? 
[01:19:30]  Can we at least do that?  She really is just oddly shaped to be naked on a popular show.  And I don't need my broads to be skinny.  No, not at all.  I want them to be proportionate.  I've been with some chubs, but they had everything in proportion.  Girl with some meat on her bones, but you know what?  It's not just meat on the lower hand.  I don't mind that.  Or I didn't mind that.  Whatever.  What?  Thick is okay.  I think it's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when all your shit is like all over the fucking place, that's a problem. 
[01:20:00]  She is like a water balloon.  You don't know what the fuck is going on.  It's like a pudding balloon.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Then she, what?  Wow.  Horrible tattoos.  Yeah.  And then she's got the worst haircut.  She's doing some of that shit on purpose.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because now it's like, how unattractive can I be and still do nude scenes without people  finally just going, all right, stop.  Because she's less attractive in the second season.  Yeah.  And she did that shit on purpose.  Then she has those tiny pointy tits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:20:30]  None of that chubbs goes to her tits.  No, but it's like all like, I don't know, it's all nipple or something.  Pop a pick of her up naked.  Yeah.  I got to see now.  And then we'll get back to the hangover trailer.  We really got to pick this apart.  We got to do a little research here.  And she always wears those completely unflattering t-shirts.  Short jumpsuit things.  Right.  Like the one piece.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, this is fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Which one do you want to start with?  Let's start with just the... 
[01:21:00]  Let's start from the top.  Yeah, yeah.  First picture.  Go to the top.  First one, left.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like pixelated.  I don't want pixelated.  Go there.  Her on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, to be fair, she doesn't look that bad, her face  at all.  That's what I'm saying.  I think she uglies herself up for the show.  I'm saying not that bad.  She has...  She's so, like...  Oh, my God.  That's fantastic.  That's a chubby kid's body.  She's got...  That's a 12-year-old fat kid's body.  Fat boy.  That's what I'm saying.  That's a fat boy's body. 
[01:21:30]  Maybe I didn't say it properly.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  It's a 12-year-old fat boy body.  She has, like, fat boy tits.  Right.  I love fat boy tits.  Isn't that great music?  Oh, Jesus.  Fat boy tits?  No.  What?  Okay.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  Can we do Fat Boy Slim Day?  Oh, Fat Boy Slim Day.  What do you think?  Yeah.  What's the other songs that you like?  Someone's begging for Jefferson Starship Day.  See, I do read my tweets, people.  What?  We built this city?  Well, no.  They're thinking more miracles.  I liked miracles. 
[01:22:00]  That was good.  And what was the other one he asked for?  Miracles and...  Oh, Jane.  Find your way back.  Find your way back to the...  Find your way back.  We built this city?  Oh, boy.  We built this city on rock and roll, man.  I'm telling you right now.  Although our mayor is not a rock and roll guy.  He's not a coffee guy either, apparently.  Fucking...  Dude.  Roland was just telling me some shit that I didn't even know about.  CNN did a whole piece on it? 
[01:22:30]  Crazy.  I meant to tell the guys, but I was dealing with some shit at my house.  I don't know if you heard.  What happened?  But I was watching the CNN piece on our mayor.  It's embarrassing.  It is.  They just showed the whole world how embarrassing our mayor is.  And all the people just take it.  You know, it's gotten so bad that he's controlling the salt content in your potato chips.  So people are going to Jersey to get their potato chips?  It's like what he used to do for booze and drugs and everything else. 
[01:23:00]  But the latest...  Drinking age.  The latest one is the Big Soda Band.  Yeah.  Which now people are like, ah, whatever.  A lot of people are like, whatever.  I'll figure it out.  But now they're really pissed because it's going to push into your coffee drinks.  Yeah.  Because it's the amount of sugar in each drink.  Yep.  So Starbucks, they're allowed to...  I don't know the exact fucking facts, but I think it's like they're allowed to give  you four packets of sugar, whatever that would be.  But a lot of these drinks obviously have more than the four packets.  So then they have to advise you, like, this is all we can give you officially.  But you can go over to the bar area and add more sugar. 
[01:23:30]  Un-fucking-believable.  E-Rock, yes.  Comment.  The Dunkin' Donuts around here was handing out these little flyers saying, you know,  the new regulations as far as how they can handle your coffee.  Right.  You can't put sugar in it, like Hope said, but also the flavoring.  Oh, I was talking about Starbucks, but what he's talking about...  I'm sorry.  I'm jumping in on this one, E-Rock.  Dunkin' Donuts, their policy is we're not putting sugar in it at all.  At all.  Yeah, you have to do it yourself.  And if you want the flavoring in your coffee, you know, like when they pump the liquid in  Yeah, the little pump with the fucking...  Spinella, whatever.  Yep, yep.  There'll be a display there that you have to do it yourself. 
[01:24:00]  Do it yourself.  So you can't order a coffee the way you want it anymore.  But you can, but you have to get the little, little one.  You're not allowed to get a large coffee anymore.  Large or extra large.  Or extra large with sugar in it.  It's astounding what this fucking mayor is doing.  Yes.  And then they're talking about, now he's talking about, I don't know how this legislation is  even supposed to work, but I caught, I heard tell about earbud restrictions in some way,  shape, or form.  Yeah, he's spending...  What's he want to do with that? 
[01:24:30]  He's spending a quarter million dollars on a campaign so kids are aware that they got  turned down their fucking music.  Exactly.  It's just a mother.  Kids will never listen to that.  He is a mommy, a little nanny.  We live in Nanny York.  I think there's a little more to that, but I think that's pretty much the basics of it.  He wants kids to be aware that you can lose your hearing if you're listening to it.  It's bad for your ears.  Look, I've been doing...  Turn that rock and roll music down for the love of God.  I've been doing radio since I was 18, so I'm pushing about 25 years in the business, 
[01:25:00]  give or take, a year or two.  30.  Shut up.  And I'm here to say, yeah, this does affect your hearing.  Even people know that.  But not that bad.  If you...  But not that bad.  People know if you wear headphones with loud music, it affects your hearing.  Some people don't give a fuck.  We wear headphones...  And that's fine.  Four plus hours a day, not counting our personal use.  It's crazy.  My tinnitus sounds like fucking 80 people skating at the same time. 
[01:25:30]  That's all I fucking hear.  It sounds like people skiing and skating in my ears.  That has to be from your band days.  Because every time you bring that up, it frightens me.  It's definitely...  I'm like, if it's happening to Anthony, it's got to happen to me.  But I don't got...  I don't got that.  I don't have that.  It was from years of having, you know, a giant back line of amplifiers behind me.  And it's so annoying sometimes.  Like when I notice it at night, it's un-fucking-believable. 
[01:26:00]  Here's what I hear.  Really?  Forever.  Really?  Forever.  Like that?  Yes.  Does it come and go?  No.  It's there all the time.  But if I have other sounds, it's tolerable.  Oh, you're never going to be able to meditate.  No, no.  I can't.  That's why I need to sleep with the TV on.  Right.  That's why I need sounds.  Action, action, action.  Right.  It's terrible.  And it's just there forever.  Does that mean Bloomberg is going to come in here and just check headphone volumes every 
[01:26:30]  morning?  I would love for him to tell you that little light thing that the doctor puts in your ear.  Let me see, sweetie.  Yeah.  Let me check your ears.  I'll say it.  Hey, guys.  Your music's too loud.  Yeah.  The reason why he's an asshole and why it drives me nuts, if he really cares about quality  of life in and out of New York City, I would start with the commute.  That's killing people.  Yeah.  I was reading an article.  People die because of their commute all the fucking time. 
[01:27:00]  The stress level.  That's real stress.  But he's increasing that stress.  Yeah.  By making it so you can't drive around.  Right.  Right.  Less places to drive.  Yeah.  And increasing tolls.  The bridges.  All the bridges and subways just went up again.  I'll say it again.  I'm a suburb guy.  I don't want to live in New York City.  New York City has a lot to offer.  Yes.  And I certainly take advantage of it.  And that's why I like having it close, but I wouldn't live here.  Yeah.  I want to be in the suburbs badly.  But that commute back when we were at N.E.W. fucking almost killed me. 
[01:27:30]  But I hated it.  It drove me nuts.  I was spending well over three hours a day just getting back and forth to work.  Well, you know, we did it together for a few years there.  A minimum of three hours a day was wasted just coming into the city.  Do you know how much it cost me to drive in?  Like, just the financial stress.  Right.  It's like $650 a month just for transportation.  That's why when he goes after the loud music, the salt, the fucking big sodas. 
[01:28:00]  I swear to you, I want to find the guy and have a conversation with him.  Like, you're a fucking asshole.  And it's adding two hours to people's work days to try to get out of here.  Yeah, because he knows.  Those people, when they're on the L.I.E. day after day after day, bumper to bumper traffic,  it is putting ridiculous stress on their hearts.  It's terrible.  And people, there was an article, are absolutely dying because of the commutes.  It's so bad.  And then, like you said, the financial shit.  Yeah.  It is ridiculously expensive to come in and out of Manhattan. 
[01:28:30]  I thank God that my hours don't put me in rush hour.  And then when I do have to drive on the expressway during rush hour, it's intolerable.  I can't fucking do it.  Comment, Iraq?  Bloomberg's also the one who keeps trying to get the tolls put on all the bridges and everything  because he doesn't like all the cars in Manhattan.  Right.  It costs like $15 to get in here.  Uh, that was fucking, um, Bill Schultz from, uh, Red Eye. 
[01:29:00]  That was him?  Yeah.  Uh.  I don't know.  He's doing them in the building.  I think he's doing Pete Dominick's thing.  Oh, is he?  Of course he is.  Um, anyway, Iraq, what else did you have on the big sodas?  I didn't mean to jump in, but I got excited.  Dunkin' Donuts had people out on the streets handing these little, uh, these little flyers  out saying, you know, starting soon, this is what we can't do anymore.  And people are just getting all pissed off.  And people are going to find their fucking sugary drinks.  It's not going to help at all.  Yeah.  It might help a tiny percentage of, of the people, but for the rest of us, it's, it's 
[01:29:30]  a major fucking hassle.  Really?  Another dumb little hassle we don't need to have.  I don't, uh, I don't get how he's getting away with this.  He's a little fucking chubby effeminate dictator is what he is.  And now with the earbuds, I don't know exactly what that is, but he can't tell you.  It's just an educational thing or is it fucking, he's going to have earbud police.  I think so.  All you do is make people aware.  Like when they were like McDonald's, you have to show your calorie count on the menu. 
[01:30:00]  It's like, okay.  So now people are aware, but you can't.  Information is one thing.  Uh, keeping people from getting something is, is another.  And you, and you can't influence, uh, the youth.  You know, when we were growing up, smoking was, uh, you know, something way more people  did and everyone was aware it was bad for you, but you got that youth shit that you think  you're going to live forever and it's not going to, you know, affect you.  That's how, how all young people think.  Yeah.  So they're not going to sit there and turn down their favorite rap song, pop song, rock 
[01:30:30]  song, whatever the fuck, because the mayor is telling them it's going to cause ear damage  eventually.  It's not going to help at all.  No.  Cause your parents tell you that shit.  People already know that.  Yeah.  But like I said, they think, ah, that's years away.  I'm young.  It's not going to happen to me.  You start changing when it starts affecting you, regardless of what anybody says.  And how the fuck are you selling booze and cigarettes in New York city?  Like, like, and not sugary drinks.  Cause on the list of things that fuck people up.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  I don't, don't get as, I don't want any of that shit banned or curtailed.  You know, I don't either, but it shows.  Stop being a hypocrite.  Right.  Because, uh, alcoholic beverage, beverages certainly cause way more problems than a dumb sugary  drink.  Oh my God.  We all know at least one person that died in a drunk driving accident.  How about you start there?  At least one.  Amazing.  That's our mayor.  How long, how much longer is he in office?  As long as I want.  Yeah.  If he doesn't fucking all of a sudden just say he's going to do a fourth term. 
[01:31:30]  And he's just a dope.  And I know we say this all the time and, but it's, it's worth repeating.  He, he will not take on the alcohol issue in this, uh, in this city.  He will not take on the commuting issue in this city because those are very complicated  and he knows he can't get anything done with those two issues whatsoever.  So no large coffee.  That'll.  So he goes after the easy shit.  What?  Just go after the easy shit.  Yeah.  It's nonsense.  Starbucks, man. 
[01:32:00]  They must be freaking out.  You got to kind of, in a way you got to make your own trade.  Now it's self-serve.  Basically.  You want to just go in there and get your fucking, you know, get your container of coffee.  Are they going to give you a, uh, uh, recipe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here, this is how you make it.  We can give you the coffee, I guess.  Yeah.  How much am I supposed to put in?  Over there.  There's all the pumps.  How much, how much am I supposed to pump in this fucking thing?  And here's a blender because now you got to blend all the shit up.  The whipped cream's over there.  And you're going to have the really fat guys that are just pumping flavor pumps into their 
[01:32:30]  drinks.  Yeah.  Boom.  No, I'm sure there'll be some flavor Nazi making sure you're not over pumping because,  you know, they don't want, they don't, they don't want their profits to drop.  Sorry.  This is a cup of caramel.  Right, right, right.  You can't just.  Oh, amazing.  Fuck it.  I didn't know that whole coffee shit was going down.  That's insane.  I didn't know it until yesterday.  They broke it down.  They said, yeah.  Dunkin' Donuts.  They will not put the sugar in the coffee for you anymore.  And it still has to be a small.  Well, no, then it could be a big cup, I guess. 
[01:33:00]  It'd be a big one if you do it yourself.  Right.  And it could be a small one if you want, like, sugar in it.  But I think they've just decided, no, we're not putting sugar in any of them at this point.  In terms of sugar harming bodies, you know where there's more harmful sugar than in Dunkin'  Donuts coffee?  In Dunkin' Donuts.  In Dunkin' Donuts.  In Donuts.  Oh, he would love to.  Well, he went after the oils already.  Yeah.  But the sugar in donuts, right.  You could literally walk in, get a dozen donuts, and eat every single one of them without 
[01:33:30]  any restriction, which is the way it should be.  But why then can't you just get a cup of coffee with four teaspoons of sugar in it?  See what I'm saying?  It doesn't make any sense.  This guy's in charge.  Bullshit power grab.  He's got all this power.  It's just nonsense.  Yeah.  Just scrape the frosting off a donut and put that in my coffee.  Or just dump the donut right in your coffee.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  You know, I saw fucking Joe DiMaggio dunking his donut at Dinky Donuts.  It did.  That's it.  Dunking his donut.  Seinfeld.  Very good, yes. 
[01:34:00]  Dinky Donuts.  That's my go-to.  Yeah.  I am.  If I ever make a reference, it's probably Seinfeld.  Yeah.  You should trick me.  Oh.  Throw another one in there.  Do something else.  And then I go Seinfeld and you go, no.  No.  Of course not.  Everyone loves Raymond.  Or everybody.  I don't know.  I didn't love Raymond.  I wasn't a fan.  I wasn't a fan of the show.  I was pretty cocky to say everybody loves Raymond.  Guess what?  Yeah.  I'm listening to a guy that was not really into the whole Raymond thing. 
[01:34:30]  You just lost me based on the title.  Big Bang Theory.  How dare you tell me I love you?  I cannot get enough of Big Bang Theory.  Thank God it's on 800 times a day.  Oh, man.  Big Bang Theory.  That show is unbelievably unwatchable.  And it does so well.  I have no idea.  It's still doing well?  It's on all the time.  I just wish they would try to squeeze more jokes into an episode.  You know what?  Holy shit.  There isn't one line of set up dialogue or anything or just conversation. 
[01:35:00]  Could you imagine if we did a show where we had a joke every minute?  Oh, my God.  How exhausting that would be?  Guys, 45 seconds, no punchline.  Oh, come on.  Hurry.  Oh, my God.  No one wants to laugh that much.  Fake laugh.  Fake laugh.  Because they have the soundtrack, the laugh track, so you're like, oh, I'm supposed to  laugh here.  It's not.  There's nothing funny.  Devoid of humor.  Devoid.  What does that have to do with Hangover?  The trailer.  Oh, right.  The trailer.  We were right in the middle of it.  Let's go. 
[01:35:30]  So what?  They're going back to Vegas.  Back to Vegas.  In the third installment.  Look out.  They were at a funeral.  Right.  We don't know who's yet.  And now they're traveling back to Vegas.  Watch out.  Zach Galifianakis has a sledgehammer in his vest.  Oh, shit.  What?  What?  Why?  Well, you've got to remember.  He's crazy.  Yeah, he is.  Wow.  You know?  He's nuts.  Mike Tyson died.  What?  Spoiler.  When?  In the movie.  In the movie, I think.  Oh, thank God.  Who else would it be? 
[01:36:00]  Not in real life.  No.  No, that's scary.  Who do you think died for this movie?  Maybe it's they finally killed off that guy who's not as funny as the other three.  Yesterday, by the way, yesterday.  And he was so pissed, we made him wait.  Yeah, he was.  And then he comes in here and he gives us nothing.  Yeah, exactly.  You can't just show up.  Yesterday was the anniversary of Mike Tyson's first professional fight, by the way.  Really?  And he posted a short video.  And it was short because he fucking rocked the guy. 
[01:36:30]  It was really cool, though.  It was his first fight.  They're poking around the ring.  It lasted a minute and change.  Poking around the ring.  And then Tyson just gets inside this guy and rocks him.  He goes down on a knee and then he's shaking his head.  And this other guy, I don't even know who it was, but he does this head shake like,  whoa, like, holy fuck, what did I get in the ring with?  Let's find this.  It was really fucking cool.  I miss Tyson fights.  I think the guy's name is James Smith.  Was it? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  But you could tell.  And then the ref comes over.  He looks at him.  He's just like, nah, give me your fucking mouthpiece.  You ain't going back.  You're done.  Tyson fights rule.  It was his head shake.  The head shake was so fucking telling, though.  This guy was on one knee with his head down, and he had to shake off the fact that he was  just in the ring with a Tyrannosaurus.  Wow.  Young Mike Tyson and first fight?  I don't know.  I don't know.  All I know. 
[01:37:30]  So the fight went longer.  Maybe Tyson just gave you the end of the fight?  Maybe he just gave me the fucking end of the fight or something.  But it was his first...  Hit it down.  Well, wait.  This is amateur shit, because they're wearing the headgear.  It's his first professional fight.  Yeah, this is amateur shit.  His first pro fight.  Headgear means amateur.  If you look for Mike Tyson's Twitter, you'll find it posted there.  You know Mike Tyson's Twitter?  I don't know.  It might be that one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How long is it?  117. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  There's no sound to it.  But it's a Mercedes.  Way to go, Yorah.  No, I'm sorry.  James Smith was the guy you won the title from.  All right.  I'm just flying around.  So it's obviously Tyson in the white trunks looking like an animal.  And it's just filmed on like a camcorder.  Yeah, this is just...  No one's in the venue, really.  And yeah, it's just somebody...  The fucking power that you see Tyson hitting this guy in the body with. 
[01:38:30]  It's not even fucking face shots.  These are body blows that are killing this guy.  Whatever happened to Mercedes?  No, no, no.  Knocked the fuck out.  And got knocked the fuck out.  He didn't even get knocked out.  He got knocked down on a knee and couldn't get back up.  And where are they fighting?  I don't know.  It's like a hotel or something.  Look at these fucking shots.  The power that that fucker had.  Oh, my God.  You know what that feels like?  And look, he's just not letting him go.  And then he...  Now the guy stood up and you saw his face.  He's like, I don't like this. 
[01:39:00]  Now he's down on the knee.  Watch his face now.  He's like, who is this guy that's in here with me?  He ain't getting back up.  He's like, look, I'm done.  He goes, I'm done.  I don't want to fight this fucking monster.  And then they hug.  Looks like he got a liver shot or something.  Yeah.  Put him down on a knee.  And that was over.  That was...  How many years ago was that?  Fuck.  That was a while ago, huh?  I would guess 25 years ago.  Professional day butt.  When is that?  85.  85. 
[01:39:30]  That's 15 plus the 13.  That's a 28 years ago.  28 years ago.  Yesterday.  Wow.  That's fucking cool as shit, though.  All right.  Hangover 3.  Hangover 3.  Then we got to break and get our pal Jim Jeffries in here.  Yeah.  From Legit on FX.  Legit.  Don't worry.  It all ends tonight.  Are there in Vegas?  Someone needs to burn this place.  That's like unfinished business.  What?  I like that.  Uh-oh.  Can you remember me?  I'm the one that picked the object.  Jack White. 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  All right.  This seems to be some kind of a...  Shootings.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Um.  All right.  They're in the desert.  The epic conclusion.  All right.  There's a prison.  Looks like Mexico.  What?  I don't know what's going on.  Mayhem.  Um.  We've been on a lot of adventures together. 
[01:40:30]  But it seems like you haven't learned anything.  Anything.  I'll be in the limo.  Three.  Yeah.  Part three.  Oh.  How great is the Jack White sound?  My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe.  Oh, my life is great.  He's driving down the highway with a giraffe.  Overpass.  Oh.  Which causes a major, major pileup behind him. 
[01:41:00]  The giraffe is dead, right?  He's looking through his side view mirror at the destruction he caused because the giraffe  hit the overpass.  My God.  That trailer, first of all, tells me nothing.  Which is good.  Which is good because you don't want the ones that give away the entire movie.  Right.  But.  It sounded good with the Jack White soundtrack.  Oh, yeah.  And then when they.  Jack White sound.  When they stop the music and then, you know, go to the action.  Dialogue.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, there's some terrific dialogue in there.  Uh.  We're all going to watch it. 
[01:41:30]  I.  You know you're going to go see it or watch it.  Do you know, I've never seen a hangover movie in the theater.  Never.  I see them when they're on demand.  Yeah.  Well, you're missing out on the movie experience.  Am I.  Because you're all.  You're all in the theater.  You're all.  Am I?  Yeah, you're all in there for the ride.  Because I don't think I am.  You sure?  Oh, it's Wolf Mother.  It's Wolf Mother.  Well, I'm an idiot.  It sounded familiar.  No, I know it's Wolf Mother.  I don't know why the fuck it is at Jack White. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, it's Wolf Mother.  I love Wolf Mother.  It's still a good song.  Yeah.  It is.  I'm an idiot.  Sorry about that.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  My sinuses are still killing me.  Well, you had a rough day yesterday.  Five buttons means daddy.  Yeah.  That's all you need to know.  I know.  What did you learn?  Push five buttons and that's where daddy is.  Daddy's five buttons away.  Can you do me a favor and read this?  Mask Sexual Flavors is the new way to foreplay.

[01:43:00]  Pleasure.  With pleasure, literally pleasure, right?  That's right.  Nice.  Should we play the Justin Bieber clip?  What's this about?  Well, the clip is just like a companion to the story.  The clip is just his manager, Scooter, getting on stage and saying, hey, Justin Bieber's  coming back.  Don't worry.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Because he's, I don't know.  I got something on Scooter.  I got to tell you. 
[01:43:30]  Scooter.  So every once in a while, I go after the Beliebers on Twitter because it's fun.  Sure.  And they always fucking write me back and they go, oh, man, now you're going to have  to deal with Scooter.  Scooter.  Good luck dealing with Scooter.  What does Scooter do?  These little brats fucking tweet back to me.  Sexy.  Scooter is like what?  His protector?  Yeah, he's his manager, assistant, confidant.  But I guess any bad tweet about Justin Bieber, they'll write you back immediately and go,  fucking Scooter is going to hear about this. 
[01:44:00]  And I feel bad for you.  Dude, what are you fucking putting up there?  That is his picture from the hospital.  Why is he posing?  He's fucking got his pants down and his undies pulled down to his pubis.  And he's doing E-Rock eyes.  Oh, he is doing bedroom eyes.  And he's got the hair fucking leading toward the penis.  Trail of tears.  What is he doing?  He's fucking flexing.  He's posing.  He's posing. 
[01:44:30]  You think the girls are loving that picture?  I would visit him and I would bring him balloons.  Let's say get well.  He looks fine.  What happened?  Is this some kind of publicity thing trying to pump up some stuff?  They said he collapsed.  It was exhaustion.  I doubt it.  Was he exhausted?  Look, man, you know, these celebrities do this shit all the time.  All right, look, today you got to collapse.  We need some world headlines.  The record sales are a little low.  So what you're going to do is you're going to collapse, but then you're going to be a fucking hero. 
[01:45:00]  And you're going to go back on that stage and finish the show.  People are going to be like, holy fuck, this guy's amazing.  He doesn't even have fluid IVs going in him.  Nothing.  There's a little Twitter war back and forth between hot actress Olivia Wilde and Justin Bieber.  Because she tweeted, Justin Bieber, put your fucking shirt back on.  Oh, good for her.  Yeah.  What about Scooter, though?  She's going to have to deal with Scooter now.  She didn't realize that she was going to have to deal with Scooter.  According to the Beliebers, man, this Scooter, you don't want to mess with him ever. 
[01:45:30]  I know.  Ever, ever, ever.  All right, here's the clip of Scooter on stage announcing what the fuck's going on.  All right.  Just got very light of breath.  The whole show, he's been complaining.  He's backstage with the EMTs and the doctor.  They're telling him that they wanted to go see somebody and see what's going on with his lungs.  He has just told me in about five minutes, if it's okay with you guys, he's going to come out and finish the show. 
[01:46:00]  Complete fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.  You can hear it in his voice.  If it's okay with you guys.  Scooter's not selling it right.  It's so fucking fake.  Celebrities do this shit.  I think we're more aware these days than we used to be.  Yeah, because you've got to do something to just keep people talking about you.  That's so fake.  You can hear how fake it is.  And if it was something like that, it was the doctors and EMTs back there, they would check him out.  They wouldn't have him do the show.  And I'll tell you why this all went down.  A couple days prior, he was two hours late. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  To the stage.  So that pisses off a lot of fucking people and a lot of his fan base.  Why was he late?  What was the official excuse?  I don't remember.  Just being completely out of touch that 14-year-old girls have to get up for school?  I don't know if there was an official excuse.  I don't know.  All right.  So then they're all sitting there like, oh, man, this is a PR nightmare.  Fucking a lot of people hating Justin Bieber right now.  So what can we do?  And then they fucking get in the back room and they spin it like, all right, here's the deal, man. 
[01:47:00]  Exactly.  You're going to be fucking, you know, fainting backstage or lightheaded backstage.  Wreck them window.  So now you get all the people that fucking hate you going, holy shit, now we understand why he was two hours late two days ago.  Because he's under a lot of pressure and stress.  Right.  It's obvious because he finally passed out.  Then they go, Justin, we need you to tweet a picture of yourself all laid up in the hospital.  Right.  He said, gotcha, guys.  I'm on it.  No Photoshop there, huh?  Let me put my sexy, but now his neck looks normal. 
[01:47:30]  Do you know that people found more stuff wrong with the photo?  Did they?  They said that your shirt's wrong.  Really?  They said my left pec, let's call it, is missing.  Like, I don't have...  That stupid-ass fuck picture.  They said that my left pec is missing.  So with the Photoshop tool, he probably was, like, coloring the black to match my shirt.  Right.  And erased my pec. 
[01:48:00]  Erased the depth.  The depth.  Yeah.  And they said your shirt is completely two different...  Is it two different angles?  Yeah, two different shirts.  I mean, it's the same shirt, but from two different pictures.  But from two different pictures.  Yeah, I think I was completely cut in half in that picture.  I believe so, too.  He took two halves of me.  They think your head is cut in half, too.  Could be.  They think your head is completely cut in half.  Could very well be.  What an asshole.  But Justin Bieber, no Photoshopping needed there.  No.  Not with that body.  Why would he pull down...  Not with that body, man. 
[01:48:30]  Show his hip bones.  Why?  I don't know, man.  Looking emaciated.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Here's more Scooter.  Canada's famous.  All right.  So, he might not be jumping around as much and everything else.  And you guys will be patient with us.  We're not trying to be disrespectful.  We're not trying to have you guys get home late.  We're truly trying to put on a show for these beautiful people that love him.  Absolutely.  Just bear with us.  He's a tough kid. 
[01:49:00]  He's going to come back out here very soon.  Oh, my God.  This is so fake.  Fake.  Fake.  Totally fake.  Is the mainstream media talking about how fake this is?  I saw there was a headline on Fox and Friends this morning.  Yeah.  Why don't they take these angles that are so obvious?  Fake, fake.  You'd be a hero.  Yeah, no, no, no.  They're talking about it.  It's so fake.  You hear how he added the whole, and don't want to be disrespectful, and they have to get  up tomorrow, and all that.  Which is obviously in response to the negative publicity they got before.  They got such bad negative publicity, they knew they had to turn it around immediately, 
[01:49:30]  so they came up with this, in my humble opinion.  What's that little tat on his hip there?  Which one's that?  Oh, he just started getting all tatted up.  Wow.  Got a little Hebrew letters here.  What's that one?  Yeah.  Right here?  Yeah.  No, it looks like a little...  He has nothing on.  Are they wings?  No.  Yeah, it looks like wings.  Are they wings?  Troy Kwan wishes he looked like Bieber.  Are you kidding me?  Look at this guy.  Why does he have fucking field hockey sticks crossed on his arm?  Over here.  Yeah, where's that? 
[01:50:00]  And he's got another, he's got a tattoo, I think it's his Believe, because that's what  his album was called.  Well, yeah.  But his album did terrible.  Uh-huh.  And so now he's got the title of the album that didn't do well.  Oh, really?  On his arm, yeah.  He's going to come into problems, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a celebrity rehab candidate.  You think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Could be.  I think it's going to be a rough fall from grace for him.  Because he's not a talented guy.  Like, Justin Timberlake has discernible talents and was able to, you know, extend that into 
[01:50:30]  an adult career.  Justin Bieber is not a talented dude, so it becomes difficult when you don't have the  kid thing going for you anymore.  Right.  But that's, that whole thing was fake.  Yeah.  And you can tell, like Ann said, he's in a hospital room with no equipment around him.  Because they're probably like, look, you know, can you give us a room?  I mean, there's paneling, and it almost looks like, you know, it's not even a room they  really use.  It kind of looks like the back of a tour bus.  It does, right? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  I mean, this thing looks like a hospital bed, but it looks like the back of a tour bus to  me.  Oh, God.  Oh, you know, it really doesn't even look like a hospital room.  Right.  Well, what's the one thing on the wall right above his head?  What is that?  Zoom in.  Because that's the only thing that...  Zoom in.  Yeah.  Now, go up.  Oh, God.  Go up.  He does have dreamy eyes.  Let's see.  Go up further.  Stop with the eyes, you know.  All right.  What is that?  Yeah.  What is that up on the wall? 
[01:51:30]  That doesn't look like anything I've seen in a hospital.  No.  And there's wood paneling.  Oh, God.  Wood paneling on a hospital.  Stupid mainstream media went with it.  Hook, line, and sinker.  Good for Scooter and the gang for figuring this out and having people bite.  Yeah.  It's so fake.  There's no IV.  No.  And if you're exhausted, you need fluids.  That's what...  Ah, floods.  And since when do they have TiVo in the hospital?  Because that looks like a TiVo remote.  Does it really?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:52:00]  This guy's in his fucking...  He's in his fucking tour bus.  They got a hospital bed.  Put it in the tour bus.  They got a gown for him.  Where are you?  I was like, yeah.  I was put in the hospital for being too sexy.  How long was he in the hospital?  Too sexy.  I need a sexiectomy.  Yeah.  I need a sexiectomy.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  It's just awful.  Nurse, could you check my nipples?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  He's fucking, like...  He's obviously flexing his abs, too.  He's like, huh?  He's doing a, huh?  How many shots do you think he took?  Oh, man.  Right?  That was that good.  You could tell he took a lot of shots.  Absolutely.  You could tell right after this he went, how was that picture?  Yes.  Nurse.  How's this?  Nurse, there's a problem with my lips.  What's wrong with them, Justin?  They're too kissable.  Very kissable.  You might want to give me some anti-kissing lips medicine.  So I could get some work done.  What a fucking load he is. 
[01:53:00]  Nurse, my eyes are a problem.  Why, Justin?  You're getting lost in them.  Oh, damn.  You guys are just jealous.  I'm sure.  Have you looked in the mirror?  Oh, my God.  It's funny what you said before about the haters pointing out your crooked teeth.  A lot of fat people have told me that I'm unattractive.  I know.  A lot of fat men.  It's endless.  I always find it strange when a guy is going after your looks. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Like, what's that about?  No offense, bro, but you are not an attractive dude.  That means nice hairstyle, dude.  Really?  He's basically saying, sorry, dude, but I'm not going to fuck you.  Like, I would find something.  If I could find things unattractive with you, I'd be able to find things attractive with you or another man.  Exactly.  That's why it's weird.  Like, I don't like your hairstyle, but there are some hairstyles on men that I do find attractive. 
[01:54:00]  Exactly.  That's my suggestion.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  God, now I got pressure to fucking complete Sudoku puzzles.  What the fuck did you start, Sam?  Oh, man.  See what you did?  For the big giveaways?  Yes.  See what you did?  Can I have, like, a guy just do the Sudoku puzzle every morning?  What did you do?  They don't have to be finished.  No, I refuse to put them out there if they're not finished.  Some of the unfinished ones could become very valuable.  Oh, yeah, and then they could feel like they're doing the Sudoku puzzle.  Puzzle alongside me.  Right.  Nice.  Oh, that would be good.  Interactive Sudoku. 
[01:54:30]  That's right.  And I have a couple that I haven't given away, so it's like, oh, you got a finished one.  You got a finished one.  You got the unfinished one.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I just got the good morning text from my house, so let the games begin.  Everyone's up and active and running around.  You might want to listen to the first hour of the show.  Oh, I had a wild day.  Oh, yeah.  Let the games begin.  There it goes.  You know, speaking of games, I love a good segue.  Yeah.  I am so pissed off at fucking SimCity. 
[01:55:00]  Why?  The new SimCity that came out.  Did you check it out?  I'd love to, but I bought it online for download.  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know where it is.  I tried downloading it.  What do you mean you don't know where it is?  They have fucked up this release so badly.  Why?  With people can't download after they buy it.  The client to download it from is fucked.  Even if you buy it and then try to install it, you need some type of, obviously, some code that you always put in and stuff. 
[01:55:30]  And that isn't working because you can't connect with the fucking server that's telling you that you bought the game.  This is one of the worst game launches.  Was it getting too much traffic?  I've ever seen.  And it fucked up everything?  Yeah, because they got this DRM, it's called, and it's their servers keeping everyone online at the same time.  It keeps you connected to their server, which overloads the servers. 
[01:56:00]  It's such a mess.  Origin is their kind of client that they use for their downloads and back and forth, and Origin apparently really stinks on ice.  So I have not even been able to play SimCity.  Is that an in-game graphic right there I'm looking at?  Yeah.  Wow.  Looks really good.  I would love to check it out.  I like the SimCity games.  They're like fucking, you know, the French fries of games, like potato chips of games.  You just sit there, you build some shit, you watch it burn, you fucking have some fun. 
[01:56:30]  It's not, you know, it's not first-person shooters or anything, but it's kind of fun.  I like it.  The graphics on this one supposedly look amazing.  Take the doors off the buildings, watch everybody burn.  Right!  What's different about this game, though?  What are some of the new features?  You know what, they just have newer buildings, graphics look great.  New shit.  New shit, yeah.  It's an upgrade of the same idea.  They don't want to change the recipe that made the other one successful, but it looks good.  You could get a lot closer to the action, you know, micromanage and shit like that. 
[01:57:00]  But I like those games.  They're fun.  But like I said, I don't even know.  I paid, I paid for it, I tried to download it, and I got, ha, ha, Travis, ha, ha.  I bought the $79.99 digital deluxe edition also.  Oh, you gotta go deluxe.  And, you know what?  I don't have it.  This is such a giant clusterfuck.  A huge clusterfuck.  And it's all their fault, because they don't, you're not allowed to play the game offline. 
[01:57:30]  Like, you would play any game not connected to the internet.  You're not allowed to play this game offline.  All right, what's that about?  You have to play the game online.  A lot of people think it's because they want that CRM in there so that you can't, you know,  like, copy the game.  So you can't copy the game.  They don't want you to bootleg the game and then just sit there in your house and play it and have fun.  But if you want a plane, you can't play the game.  No.  Oh, no.  Not unless you're connected to the internet.  You need to be connected to the internet. 
[01:58:00]  So even if you're not, and that doesn't mean you're playing.  What about the iPad people that want to just play it as they're flying or something?  They have, like, an iPad game, but it's not.  No, it's not.  But it's nothing like that.  Here's the deal.  Even if you're playing solo, just alone, in your own little world, like you would, you're not playing multiplayer or anything.  You're still connected to their servers.  And none of their servers work.  It's fucking a disaster.  It might be the most disastrous video game launch ever for a very anticipated game, too.  That's the thing. 
[01:58:30]  They haven't released a new SimCity in years.  And this was really hyped up.  So with all the new game technology that's out there, graphics and fucking speed, the detail, it was very anticipated.  I was looking forward to getting it.  And, yeah, fucking bought it online for digital download.  And you literally can't play the game.  I then went to my origin page and clicked new games, and it's not there.  Wow. 
[01:59:00]  It's not fucking there.  People are still trying to review the game.  They can't get online to review the game.  I haven't even been able to download it.  I don't own it yet.  I paid for it and don't even fucking own the game.  How are you going to be able to prove that you even...  I have no idea.  Okay.  Yeah, because I...  I went to put in the code off of my email.  They give you the game code.  And I type it in.  I hit send.  You know what it said?  Code already has been used.  No, it hasn't.  I bought the game.  Oh, what a nightmare.  It's a...  I don't even know how... 
[01:59:30]  Because now I'm just going to probably go out and buy a hard copy of it.  I still won't be able to play it.  But at least I'll have it.  Yeah.  I mean, now I don't...  I paid 80 bucks and I don't even own the game.  These fucking pricks.  Well, that's why I don't like to download any game because I like to have the hard copy of it.  You know what?  If you want instant gratification to play the game, you assume...  You assume...  I mean, that second I want to play.  I was like, oh, I want to play SimCity. 
[02:00:00]  It's out.  Here.  I'm downloading it.  I'll be playing it in, you know, an hour.  No.  I'm really glad this happened to EA because there could not be a worse company.  Oh, yeah.  For this.  EA Games.  Just a fuck.  They've...  In the last few years, they've really...  They've really tried to, like, kind of, like, screw the used game market.  Like, all the sports games have a one-time online activation code.  Yeah.  So if you try to buy the game used, you then have to buy a new code from EA to play it online. 
[02:00:30]  They don't want you...  No.  Yeah.  God.  They really...  Yeah, this is great.  So do they release a statement or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're working hard.  Just so you know...  Yeah.  And this will make you feel better.  Oh, good.  This is obviously not the situation we wanted for our launch week.  Oh.  And...  Oh, I thought it was.  Oh, and...  I thought this is exactly what they were going for.  And...  Yeah.  We want you to know that we are putting everything we have at resolving these issues. 
[02:01:00]  Oh.  Oh, really?  That's right.  So is there a timeline?  Did you try rebooting the server?  Did you unplug your computer?  Did you plug it back in?  What we are doing is deploying more servers over the coming two days, which will alleviate  many...  Many, not all, many of the ongoing issues.  All right.  What do I do on my computer with a coffee cup holder and foot pedal?  Do I hit the foot pedal?  And...  But because I pressed the button and the coffee cup holder came out. 
[02:01:30]  We're also paying close attention to all the bug reports that we're receiving from our fans.  It's a swarm of locusts.  Locusts.  Your bug reports.  Because they're...  Oh.  So someone's really reading those send error reports.  Oh, right.  Send...  Should I send an error report?  Yes.  Yes.  Mad.  They're not going to stop until things are smooth.  Oh, all right.  That's good.  This team has put everything into this game and won't stop until things are smooth.  We ask our fans to be patient.  Yeah.  As our team works diligently to fix the issues.  I knew that word was going to be in there somewhere. 
[02:02:00]  I am...  I cannot imagine, first of all, obviously, people know, Anthony has some disposable income.  Right?  A little bit.  I got a little bit of disposable income.  If I see something, I like it, I'll probably purchase it without really thinking about how  it will affect my electric bill or, you know, paying the rent or anything.  Right, right, right.  But $80 to buy a game, you've shown that you really want to fucking play this game and 
[02:02:30]  you're a fan of it and everything.  $80.  I could not imagine the regular working guy blowing $80 on this and getting nothing.  Not even an acknowledgement that you bought the fucking game.  You know?  Amazing.  All right.  Well, keep us updated on this, please.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Constantly.  Amazon yanked it from their download store because they got well over 800 one-star reviews.  Oh, my God.  And it was released when? 
[02:03:00]  Yesterday?  Last night?  No, Tuesday.  Oh, Tuesday?  Yeah.  Wow.  This is like day four.  Well, I mean, it was released on Tuesday and Amazon yanked it like midway through Wednesday.  Oh.  So.  Crazy.  Yeah.  I got a TV update.  No, Ian.  Oh, what do you mean?  Oh.  They got an update.  Oh, oh, oh, the cracked TV.  Yes.  Listen to the first hour of the show.  I had a weird day yesterday.  But here's your update.  Our car is here.  Oh, no.  That's somebody else. 
[02:03:30]  Sorry.  This is the text that just came in.  Okay.  My son.  Your son.  He didn't write the text.  I would say.  This is about him, though.  The text would be five characters.  Yeah, yeah.  Five buttons.  He just told me it was an accident.  Call a man to fix it.  But I told him the TV is broken and we can't watch TV.  He said it was an accident.  Call a man to fix it.  Right.  He's taking responsibility and he's delegating.  In his little brain, he knows that people just fix shit for him, I guess. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, they know how things get done.  At least you know you're not raising a blue-collar kid.  He said fix it and then drop the N-bomb.  Fix it.  Wow.  Kids are smart.  Kids are.  If there's not a toy at the toy store that my daughter wants, she'll be like, so just  order it online.  Oh, she knows.  Like, they know how this shit works now.  She knows.  Yeah, just order it online.  I was talking about kids' toys on Twitter over the weekend.  When I get up early and I get to hang with the parents, they're the only other ones that  are up as early as I have. 
[02:04:30]  And we were talking about kids' toys.  Have you seen the commercial for the Stompies?  Stompies?  I got Stompies.  What the fuck are Stompies?  Stompies are like slippers for the kids, but as they stomp or walk around, like, the  ears pop up and lights go off.  Huh?  She has the frog.  But a lot of the parents that I've been in contact with, they say that you have to be  like 200 pounds to make them work.  Oh, so you're admitting they're horrible.  They're just, they're glorified slippers, but like, yeah, you've really got to fucking 
[02:05:00]  jump really hard to make them work.  My point that I got into for a little bit, and you'd probably be into this as well,  where the TV commercials make it look like it's the most amazing toy ever.  You've got these little fuckers, they can't weigh more than 20 pounds, and they're walking  around with their Stompies, and the ears are moving, and the lights are going off, and  all that.  But the reality is, you have to be 200 pounds to make these things work.  For it to work.  Right.  Oh, she loves those Stompies, then. 
[02:05:30]  Does she stomp?  Yeah.  So, I said it's an art form to make shitty toys look amazing on TV.  Look great.  Well, we used to get bamboozled by that in the old days.  Oh, God, yeah.  Shitty toys, and then you'd get them, and you're like, this is meh.  Right.  This is shitty.  They have all these amazing scenarios.  Yeah.  And you can do it with the fucking toys.  The effects, like the G.I. Joe commercials would always be like, G.I. Joe, and he's fucking  in the fighter plane, and it's, and they're showing him, like, shooting again, and it's  like, what?  Yeah.  I've got to move this thing around myself?  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  I was going to fly around the yard.  Exactly.  What happened?  I guess they put rules in place.  I think when we were growing up, there were no rules, so they did make it look like your  toys flew by themselves.  Yeah.  They really did kind of jazz up all the toys.  You know what commercials really make toys look awesome, when I know for a fact that they're  not, all the wrestling toy commercials.  Oh, God, because the wrestlers would play with them.  Yeah.  What?  And, like, just, like, jumping off the top rope, and...  Oh, it made it look like they were really jumping.  It makes it look like, like, you buy these toys.  Watch the Ultimate Warrior smash! 
[02:06:30]  And then the warrior goes, argh!  That's right, they were in the commercials.  And Sergeant Slaughter's playing with the Sergeant Slaughter, and the honky-tonk man, he can't  win his match.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the Benoit is doing what he does with the other action figures.  Hey, little kid, I'll play.  And then he just chokes a little kid to death.  Oh, he chokes a little kid.  Oh, he chokes a little kid.  Wow.  Owen Hart just falls.  Why did we go there?  Come on, Travis.  I'm sorry.  With the Owen Hart stuff.  That was terrible.  Did Trisha and PA, did Opie buy the slushy machine that doesn't work?  See, now everyone's calling with the toys that they got... 
[02:07:00]  Toys that stunk.  ...bamboozled into fucking buying.  What's the slushy machine?  I don't know.  Sounds kind of fun.  I'm sure it's great.  By the way, people that are calling or sending tweets about, you should check out this game,  or you should check out this game.  I want to check out SimCity.  Right.  I'm not asking for game recommendations.  I have one.  SimCity, and I want to play it.  I paid 80 bucks already.  Don't give me other games that I should be playing.  I know the games that are out there.  I know which ones I want to play. 
[02:07:30]  Can we just take one phone call?  Because this guy said he got bamboozled into a remote-controlled ghost.  Well, I got to hear that.  Adam in Jersey.  Hey, I'm about your age, guys.  Oh.  Oh, a child of the 80s, Sam.  Nice.  I don't know.  You may have your age wrong.  In the back of a comic book, it said remote-controlled ghost.  So I saved up all this money, sent it in, and I got a balloon, a piece of string, and a little hook. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  You blow up the balloon, you put the string on, and you put it through an eye hook, and then you just make it move.  But what was it?  What's the remote-control part?  What's the ghost part, too?  Ghost parts are missing.  Was there a rag?  Was there a white rag over it?  No, you had to do that yourself.  Wait, so they gave you a balloon, a piece of string, and an eye hook?  Sounds like an Irwin Mainway toy.  Wow, that's terrible.  We did scare the retard on our street with it. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, wow.  Could you please find the commercial for the remote-controlled ghosts?  The internet has all this.  Was it in the back of a magazine, though?  Yeah, it was in the back of an Archie's comic.  Oh, an Archie's comic.  Do you know the name of the product itself?  No, they're actually remote-controlled Pac-Man.  Yeah, it was probably some really stupid, like, cheap...  Oh, wait, wait, go down, go down.  Go down.  No, no, no.  I saw it.  It was an ad.  It's got to go up.  Up, up, I mean.  Yeah, yeah, keep going.  Keep going.  Right there.  What's that?  Oh, that's got to be it. 
[02:09:00]  Monster Ghost.  Monster Ghost.  What does it say, Sam?  It's hard to read.  Seven-foot ghost darts and hovers, its eyes glowing eerily in the dark, remotely controlled  up to 50 feet, so you can hide and watch.  $1.25.  $1.25 for a remotely controlled ghost.  Go back, because there was another one.  Was your ghost seven feet tall?  It could be, if you put a seven-foot tall fucking...  Ghost is seven feet tall?  $0.25.  You control seven-foot life-size ghost, only $0.95. 
[02:09:30]  That's what it said, but all she got was a big balloon.  Soars 30 to 40 feet or more in the air.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  And it always leads to porn.  Conceal in pocket, ready to operate.  Wow, what a load of shit for $0.95.  You'll never know when you're going to stay out.  $0.95.  There was the worst ghost product.  Yeah.  It was back when I was in England, so they probably didn't do this here, but it was when  Ghostbusters came out.  Right.  And some fast food place, if you ordered enough food, you could get a ghost in a can. 
[02:10:00]  Whoa.  And we'd get it, and these little Ghostbusters 2, like, soda cans, and like, oh, this is  going to be great.  And you'd open it, and it was just, like, the condensation of nothing.  Like, they just packed air in the can.  Oh, so it was like, and it's supposedly a ghost that you just released.  And I was just, like, looking at it, and even at, like, six years old, I was like, you  knew you were fucking.  God damn it.  I don't want to eat at Hardee's. 
[02:10:30]  You're Mark.  You are Mark.  We really got to take a break.  Jim Jeffries is waiting to come on, so.  Yeah.  Thank you for your phone call there, Adam.  No problem.  Enjoy your weekend.  And we're going to take a break, get Jeffries in here, and also we got Terrence.  Howard coming in tonight.  Yes.  Big star.  He's a huge star.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  We got Jim Jeffries in the studio. 
[02:11:00]  Hello.  And I was just thinking as I was turning on the mic, what happened to us?  Because Jim Jeffries has been doing our show for, I don't know, many years at this point.  Probably four years.  Four years.  And here we are exchanging baby pictures.  I know.  I'm like, what happened?  Well, you know what?  The weird thing is that we used to do that before, but now it's less creepy because we've  got kids.  Jim Jeffries' son is four months old.  My daughter's five months old, and we were just doing a little exchange there. 
[02:11:30]  See, that's a thing.  I always feel awkward, like, showing baby pictures, because I understand, like, people  aren't going to be as excited as you are.  Not to other parents, but when I showed Anthony, it's a bit weird when you go...  No, the kid's adorable.  Yeah, the kid's cute and everything, but it's...  We got two R's on Anthony.  If you've got ugly kids, don't show.  The thing is, I like kids.  I've always liked kids, so for me, it was always fun, but sometimes you'd be with other  comedians, and you'd be like, here's my baby, and they...  They don't want anything to do with it.  You've got to understand that.  Yeah, yeah, you've got to get it. 
[02:12:00]  But when you're a new dad like myself, it's still all exciting and new.  I imagine if I had another child and another child, the novelty would wear off.  Yeah.  There's a drop-off.  Well, Ray, there's not as many pictures, not as many toys.  My brother rang me up the other day, and he goes, fucking kids, he goes, I'll tell you  what, by the time they're 10, you've seen everything they can do.  And I said, well, you've got two daughters, you don't know, mate.  You've got all the future, where they're banging guys. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, fuck.  And with the drug problems that come.  Right, sure.  The trouble that they're getting into.  You haven't seen everything they can do.  Fast forward, my son's almost three.  I've got a broken TV at home from yesterday.  Why?  He fucking was playing his T-ball in my living room.  What's that?  Connected.  You know what you've got is a spiderweb parent right there.  Swinging them at.  Well, you've got to listen to it.  That one high and wide for ball duty.  I'll say it again.  You've got to listen to the first hour of the show today.  It was an unusual day yesterday. 
[02:13:00]  But he brought a T in, and the ball, and the bat.  I know.  One part of your parenting was like, I'm going to stop at the third object.  How funny is it to hear it, because he doesn't know what happened.  There was too much.  My whole family's sick.  Right.  He might have got into the chocolate when I wasn't looking.  Right.  Once again, you put it up on a high shelf.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  In the end, it's certainly my fault, but I just kind of gave up yesterday for a little  while.  Yeah, yeah.  I get that.  And my TV suffered.  65-inch TV is done, because you can't get these fixed. 
[02:13:30]  Now you get an 80.  That's what I'm saying.  It's time to upgrade.  I think that's what I'm going to do.  I got an 80, and now they're selling 90s at Best Buy.  I got the 90.  And now I'm like, fuck.  Dude, I got the 90.  It's fucking sick.  I know, but 80 was sick, but now I feel like my TV sucks balls.  You feel like it's small.  You've got to get the 90, dude.  Yeah, I can't see anything.  When are we going full wall?  Full wall.  They're going to do full wall.  Yeah, but I did that with projectors, but projectors suck unless you've got a cinema room. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  If you've just got it in your house with some cunt who's just like, look how big it is.  There's always someone walking in front of it.  Don't you understand how this technology works?  Don't walk in front of it.  The only great thing is that you can watch porn and involve yourself like you're a shadowy  man that fucks everyone else.  Are you doing full shadow person?  Fucking watch your shadow boner.  Yeah, I'm just in the corner wanking.  Are you diaper guy with the kid?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  You know, I like, of course, he's still on breast milk right now, so his shits don't stink 
[02:14:30]  too bad, you know, but like my girlfriend was on antibiotics for a week and he had to  go on formula and his shits were really bad.  So I don't know if I'm too excited when he, when he goes into solids.  When, when, when, when do you start with solids?  I don't know.  Six months, I think.  Yeah, it's five or six months.  I think you're close.  Six months, I think.  Have you had the shit all the way up the back too?  Oh yeah, he shits up his back.  No, it's not.  I'm just doing this for him, by the way. 
[02:15:00]  Sometimes I shit on his back.  I just, just when my girlfriend gets home, I'm like, look at how big this one is.  How do you get blood in it?  Wait, wait till you start, wait when he's eating real food and you, you can't believe  how big his shit is.  You're like, how the fuck was this in this tiny little fucking baby?  I enjoy that, I enjoy that first shit that's got a bit of placenta in it.  Oh, the black?  The black one.  The black tar.  Yeah, the black tar where you're like, is this what it's going to be like forever?  Oof.  We didn't have it, we didn't have a doctor really tell us that, about the black shit. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, the, the, the dreaded black shit.  It's tar.  Like, and really their first shit, because they've just been living on fucking placenta  and they probably fluids Guinness in their bottles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like Guinness.  I've had the black tar, but it's usually after a night of many Guinness.  It does look like something.  It looks like runny Vegemite.  Like you'd scoop out the bottom of a thing.  Yeah.  It's not pleasant.  God.  Yo, that's fucked.  Dude, I got to tell you, man.  Legit is an awesome show.  Yeah.  For real. 
[02:16:00]  Well, I know we're friends at all, but I hope you believe me, because sometimes we have  to lie in this show.  Legit is a good fucking show.  We have our moments.  You know, I'm not going to lie to you and say they're all gold, but we have good episodes  and bad, but hopefully we have more good ones than we do bad.  But it's, uh, I know, I know for a fact that the last three or so episodes are awesome.  And, uh, and I was very happy with the first sort of five and then we had a little, but  it's, it's doing well.  I think, I, I, I hope we'll get a second season.  Yeah.  You know, it, but it's weird because now after making it, I know what people like and what 
[02:16:30]  people don't like about the show.  The second season, I put more of what people like, but you don't know when you go, all  right, I'm going to get a mentally challenged guy called Rodney in and see if it works and  don't do it too much because people might get offended.  People love mentally challenged Rodney.  And we, we talked to you on the phone.  Rodney is Rodney, man.  He's, he's, he's the real guy.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  He's the real deal.  I rang him up the other day and I said, how are you doing, Nick?  And he goes, his name's Nick Daly.  And he goes, I'm doing pretty good. 
[02:17:00]  And I said, uh, since the show's been on, I said, I bet you're getting noticed in the  street.  He goes, I haven't been noticed in the street at all.  And then, then like later on in the conversation, he goes, mind you, I haven't been out on the  street since the show.  Where's he living?  He lives with his mother.  Okay.  Yeah.  He's, he's just, uh, I don't know what quite what his condition is, but he's, he's, he's  there.  He's, is he a trainable? 
[02:17:30]  We learned about trainables.  He's trainable.  Well, see, this is what we do with, with Nick is right.  We don't have anything for him in the script.  We just go, Rodney's coming in today.  And then we just sit in front of the camera and we just feed him lines.  Say this, say that, say this, say that.  He just repeats it like a parrot.  And, and, and, you know, eventually he hits on something.  He'll hit on something.  I'll show you.  I can't put this up online, but, uh, he has a sex.  I haven't.  I'm just, sorry.  I'm just looking at Michael Bolton.  What is he doing?  How did he, Michael Bolton shouldn't have any hair left. 
[02:18:00]  Like, what's he doing?  He's got the plugs.  He's, he's back.  Did he, did he?  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's because he lost it completely.  He's had, he's had it, but not that successfully from the looks of it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  There we go.  That's, uh.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Dude, what the fuck?  What are you doing?  I won't even text it to anyone.  I just don't want the picture coming out.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[02:18:30]  And you can't put that online?  Uh, no, not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet, because I don't know whether, I don't know whether they're cutting that scene out  of the show.  And if they, oh, that's a scene in the show.  If they leave it in the show.  Gotcha.  Oh my God.  Then we're all good.  We won't even explain it.  Yeah, but.  It's a good picture, though.  That's fucking funny, man.  And he didn't know what he was doing then.  He had no idea.  No, huh?  He just, hmm.  We have another, we have an episode coming up where there's, there's basically a management  company that has all the disabled people. 
[02:19:00]  Really?  Yeah.  So if you need a disabled person for a movie or TV show, they, they're the guys to go to.  The Capables.  The Capables.  The Capables.  It's like the Expendables.  Except these people are actually Expendable.  No.  But what it is is basically, basically it's a, it's an agency where we got Nick from and  we, we, we auditioned some other different, um, people.  And, and so we, we have an episode that's set in, it was a story.  Basically, I got fired from a disabled home for racing disabled people once. 
[02:19:30]  And the guy was like, you have to go.  And I said, why?  I go, you were there, you were racing, you were gambling, you were just as bad as me.  And he's like, I didn't put numbers on their backs.  You can't put numbers.  There's a line.  Yeah.  But you do that on a professional athlete.  It's good.  But you put, you dehumanize the person with a number, like a horse.  Anyway.  So, um, so we had this idea that there'd be, I'd have to do some community service or something.  And I'm going to hang out in a disabled home for the day.  Right.  Where, where Billy used to build her. 
[02:20:00]  So we rig up this agency and we went, give us all of them.  I want to collect them all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had, we had like five down syndromes, a few cerebral palsy.  We had this big tall guy that looked normal, that had an IQ of under 10.  Right.  And so the problem was is they never have more than two of them working at a time.  They're always, there's always one in a Hallmark movie. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  And there's always one doing some advert where it looks like it's beaten up for a charity.  Right.  And, uh, so they have like two carers in the agency that have to come out and set with  them.  Sure.  They didn't have enough carers.  They brought out two and we had 30 of them.  Wow.  Wow.  And so we needed a disabled Wrangler.  They, they were all, uh, they're all walking in separate directions.  And we had this, we had this one scene where it was like, um, the premise of the episode, 
[02:21:00]  I don't think I'm ruining anything because it's not like there's huge plot lines in the  show, but the premise of the episode was there was one of their carers was a girl and I liked  that, but all the, all the, uh, capables, let's call them decided that they're in love  with this girl and they got to get me out of their, their building.  Right.  That's the whole thing.  So we got this, we got one of the, this, the, the, the assistant director goes up to  all the disabled people and said, here's the deal.  All right.  Like you're in love with her, but Jim's trying to get her. 
[02:21:30]  So you hate Jim.  All right.  Simple enough.  Yeah.  Simple concept that a few of them took to half, right?  A few, one of them in particular, one down syndrome lad started to believe that this was  his actual life.  Instead of acting, right?  Instead of acting.  He ended up from acting.  He decided he's in love with this girl and that I'm the enemy. 
[02:22:00]  So we're about to go to lunch.  I go off to have a piss.  We're in an actual disabled home.  Right.  So I just, I'm urinating in a cubicle and then I hear, right?  I turn around.  There's a giant down syndrome person blocking my cubicle going, you stay away from her.  And I'm like, ah, no cameras rolling or anything.  Oh man.  And you can't hit a down syndrome kid.  Yeah, it's not like I can hit the guy. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, that'd be a bad headline.  Oh my God.  So I start ringing, yelling out for one of the ADs.  I'm going, Paul!  Paul!  And so a whole lot of people have to come and restrain the down syndrome person.  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  And then at lunch there was one of them.  I'm putting all my food on my tray.  I'm the star of the fucking show, right?  If they want to stay on this show and another episode might come up, they want to be good 
[02:23:00]  to me, right?  Sure.  I'm getting my food, putting my mashed potatoes, one of them just comes up and slaps it out  of my head.  Holy fuckers.  Imagine doing that on any set going up to one of the actors.  You've got like two lines the whole day going up.  And the lead guy, you smack the...  I hate this cunt, babe.  Oh man, you'd be off the set if you weren't retarded.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, but all it was was I had to apologize for making him angry, you know? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's your problem.  Yeah, it's your issue.  You're the bad guy.  Wow, that's fucking hilarious.  That's a great story, Jim Jeffries.  We got this...  There's Ratzenbergs in it now, right?  Love it.  We got this episode where Ratzenberg's hanging out with all the disabled people and the whole  lot of prostitutes in the vicinity.  And we've got this on film, and I don't know why this came out of John's mouth.  He just went up to the Down Syndrome person and whispered in their ear, yeah, yeah, maybe  if we pull our money, we can get one of them to dance on the couch. 
[02:24:00]  He seems like a wild guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's fucking great.  Pretty wild?  Yeah, he's probably...  He probably entertains you on the set.  Yeah, he's very entertaining on the set.  He is Cliff.  You know, often he'll just tell you inventions, and you're like...  I'm not sure whether he's invented it.  He goes, yeah, you know when you get those hampers, and they get that crinkled-up paper. 
[02:24:30]  That was my cut.  I invented that cut when I was working as a boy, and he stole that from me.  And there's a bit of you where he's like, maybe he did invent that cut.  Maybe he did.  I don't think so, but I don't want to question him, because he could go into a rage.  And you talked about how you were a fan of his for quite a while, and to be working  with him is fucking cool.  To be working with him is cool, actually, because I met him here on this show.  Right.  And it's just... 
[02:25:00]  So, I went to him the other day, and I said, like, I said, well, you know, you've worked  with some big actors and stuff.  He goes, yeah, I worked with Lawrence of Olivier.  Did a movie with him.  Yeah, I asked him, I said, what's your biggest acting tip?  And he told me, never leave your wallet in your trailer.  Right?  And I...  But he said it so...  That's fucking great.  That's a great invitation.  It's...  Yeah, and, like, he's a cool guy. 
[02:25:30]  Like, he smokes and stuff, and, you know, he came to my gig in LA.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, but the thing is, we're doing...  So, I did Kimmel, like, last night.  You killed on Kimmel, by the way.  Right?  Yeah.  And, like, we can't get press for fucking Ratzenberg.  And it's like, this is his first sitcom since Cheers.  Right, yeah.  Someone bring the cunt on so he can tell all of his stories.  He's fucking great.  Why wouldn't they?  You're right.  I'll tell you what, with Kimmel, though, man, I was... 
[02:26:00]  Jessica Simpson was there.  I was trying to just...  I just wanted to meet that, like...  She's chunky when she's pregnant.  Yeah, she's pretty fucking chunky now.  Nice, fat legs on her, man.  You like that, yeah?  Well, you know, I got used to that over the course of nine months.  Oh, okay.  And so, it was a bit of a memory for me.  And it's like, she was, like, advertising that she's basically made dresses now for pregnant 
[02:26:30]  chicks that are a bit slutty.  Oh, okay.  Because you still want to feel pretty when you're pregnant.  Right.  And I felt like going, but you're not.  So, why try to get that feeling?  Just do your time.  You know, I don't put fucking braids in my hair because I want to feel like I have a lot  of it.  You know what I mean?  You're not pretty.  Just act dowdy, get on with it, and move on. 
[02:27:00]  You might get it back.  You never know your luck.  You might get it back.  Yeah.  She's still quite attractive, though, the Simpson, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's still something about her.  Well, she's got a pretty face, right?  Always had the pretty face.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice rack.  Well, she's got a big fucking...  She's got big...  Huge fetus.  Yeah, but they're sloppy looking now.  It's that whole thing with tits, man.  Whenever you meet, like, a fat chick, and she'll say something like, I might be fat, but  I've got great tits. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  And they always act like they're good.  No, you don't.  You have fat tits.  You have fat tits.  They're sloppy.  They're saggy.  You're right.  It's that whole thing.  Big doesn't mean good.  Even if they're great, right?  I wouldn't buy a Picasso if the frame was made out of dog shit.  You know what I mean?  You'd never go, oh, I'm hanging that on my wall because the thing in the middle is so  good.  Oh, my God.  Go down.  I mean, up.  Go up.  The first picture.  Up there.  I can't see what's going there.  The one in the red bathing suit. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Swimsuit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She is perfect in that picture.  That is a perfect body right there.  She was great when she was washing that car in that Dukes of Hazzard video.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Holy mother of Christ.  But I didn't get to meet her.  I'm next door to her.  They fucking...  This is how I'm famous.  I am.  It's when you get into the Kimmel thing, they have this alleyway on either side. 
[02:28:30]  And 50 meters in one direction, they've got it fenced off.  And 50 meters in the other direction, they've got it fenced off.  And there's just Pavarazzi just waiting for her to do the 10 meter walk from her car to the door.  Right.  I come in, I'm holding an actual baby.  I took my baby down.  Not one photo.  Oh, no, man.  She comes in five minutes later.  They back the fucking truck up to the door so she can slither out the back.  So not one photo is taken. 
[02:29:00]  Holy shit.  I think to myself, it's like, what's the big deal, right?  They just want to have a photo of her.  She's just been on Ellen that day.  Everyone knows what she looks like.  But what they want is they want pregnant girls slipping in puddle.  Yes.  They want to fuck up.  They absolutely want to fuck up.  They don't want a pretty photo of her.  They want one leg coming out and fucking one flap just dangling out of her underwear.  Or a big fucking sloppy titty nipple shot. 
[02:29:30]  Or just like a baby's hand reaching out.  Some guy was fucking pissing me off on Twitter.  You see that guy that was like, hey, Jim, why don't you ask Anthony why he doesn't promote your show?  I fucking talk about it all the time.  I don't worry about things like that.  I was so pissed with that guy.  I blocked him.  It's like the thing is, because I'm anti-gun, you're pro-gun.  I understand the fucking deal, right?  We don't all agree on everything for the rest of our lives.  Otherwise, that's just how the world is.  We all have opinions. 
[02:30:00]  As soon as I say something, Annie Gunn, fucking every cunt goes, Anthony, Jim doesn't like guns.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, you're telling on fucking teacher, man.  Did you hear what Jim Jeffries said, Anthony?  Because he's fucking...  And I'm supposed to go, oh, because Jim Jeffries has a different point of view about guns than I do.  I'm supposed to hate him.  He comes from a different place.  Exactly.  That too.  It's like...  But there's not a culture of guns.  What's your take on guns, really quickly? 
[02:30:30]  Well, we had guns in Australia, and then there was massacres, and now we don't have guns in Australia,  and we haven't had a massacre since we banned them.  But I get the difference, right?  But the country was able to ban guns, because that's never going to happen in America.  We had a huge massacre in a place called Port Arthur in Tasmania, and they banned them like  in two weeks.  It was all over.  And there wasn't an outrage?  The difference between America and Australia is very simple.  When they said to the Australian public, we're going to ban guns, the Australians went,  yeah, all right, then, yeah. 
[02:31:00]  I'm going to get that here.  And you do it to America, you go, don't take our guns.  And people are like, fuck off.  Yeah, it's not going to be as easy as that here.  I've never seen white people saying that.  I've never seen white people going, don't take my guns.  It's like, you ask a black person, you go, what about your guns?  They're always like, I don't have any guns.  What are you talking about?  I don't have any.  None of my friends have guns.  No, not legal ones, anyway.  They'll ban certain types of guns eventually, but they'll never ban guns in America.  I'm all for muskets. 
[02:31:30]  The second event was written during...  Because the musket gives you a lot of time to calm down.  While you're fucking tamping the powder.  When you're fucking got that big rod down the front of the barrel, you're like, wait  there, fuck face.  You're like, all right, I'm mad, but I'm not mad to take out ten people, I just realized.  I'm mad enough to take out the one.  Wouldn't you love to hear a school shooting where it's like, a kid has a broken rib in  front of him?  It's like, ah, now you've got to pull out the thing and tamp it. 
[02:32:00]  I think what will happen is they'll get rid of semi-automatic weapons.  And, you know, I don't understand when people say they have it for security.  I understand when some people say that, but it's like...  And then someone will say you had it locked in a safe.  And it's like, well, that's not security then, if it's locked in a safe.  I hate the locked in a safe.  Unless it's on you.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's how it's got to be.  Yeah, you can't have it locked in a safe because you're going to have a guard.  It's not like Oscar Pistorius, before he shot his girlfriend, had to go to his safe. 
[02:32:30]  Left 23, right 36.  He dragged himself along the floor.  How did he get bail?  This is the thing.  If it happened in any other country but South Africa.  Because the thing is with South Africa, cunts do come through your window a lot.  Look, if I was living in South Africa, I'd be all four guns.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I'd be fucking armed to the teat in fucking South Africa.  But this is the thing.  You know what happens.  It's Valentine's Day.  She's fucking hot.  He's like, you know, it's fucking three more years until the legless bastard gets to run again in any type of sporting event. 
[02:33:00]  He's got some downtime.  Yeah, he's got some downtime.  And so she's there going, I might go off with a rugby player.  At least he's a real man.  Oh, man, he don't want to hear that.  At least he's a complete man.  He said, you fucking bitch.  I'll show you a complete man.  And he dragged himself across the floor, went to his safe.  You'd think to get his gun, wouldn't you?  But no, that's where he keeps his blades, right?  That's the fucking spatula feet. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, he got his spatula feet out.  He fucking put them on.  And then he just, and this is the thing that they're saying.  If someone, if they broke into the house, why was the bathroom door locked?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the bit.  Because it's not like he climbed, or Robert climbed through the window and went, I'm just about soap and toiletries.  Yeah, that's it.  That's all I want.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got into a fight with, because they reckon there's a text from her to a rugby union player.  And rugby's like a much more popular sport than legless running in South Africa. 
[02:34:00]  Fucking man's sport right there.  Yeah.  That was it.  You don't want to hear that shit.  But fucking hell, she's a good looking bird, huh?  Probably not so much now with the bullet wounds to the face.  But probably not.  See, this is the thing, is when my baby was, well, my girlfriend's pretty, you know, that type of stuff, right?  But having a kid doesn't make you stop wanting to fuck things.  Right.  And I thought maybe it would, but it doesn't.  So I do it the same way as quitting cigarettes.  I'm like, I'm not going to fuck something today, right? 
[02:34:30]  Just today.  Yeah.  Because you take it day by day.  One day at a time.  One day at a time.  I'm not going to, I'll take it like an addict, right?  Actually, I'll tell you a quick story on that.  I fucking, so I was talking to Dr. Drew and I was like, because I hang out with Dr. Drew, right?  Okay, yeah.  Because I do his radio show, we don't even know.  He's had a tough month.  I rang him up and I said, hey, what's wrong with Dr. Drew?  Nothing wrong with him.  Some of his patients.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:35:00]  And I, I, I, I rang him up and I said, Dr. Drew, I said, uh, I said, I'm, I'm, I, he said, I can't stop fucking things.  Right?  Mostly prostitutes.  I said, he goes, maybe you're a sex addict, because I live in LA, everyone's an addict or something.  He goes, go on to some meetings just to keep yourself in check.  So I went along to a couple of meetings.  Wow.  It's kind of cool, Sex Addicts Anonymous, because you meet a lot of people where you go, I'm not that guy, right?  So me, I just stand up and go, I really like prostitutes.  Have a big per shot for prostitutes. 
[02:35:30]  Really like fucking prostitutes.  And then there's another guy's like, I'm cheating, been cheating, cheating on my wife every day.  And then there's like someone will stand up and go, I want to fuck my kid.  And you'll be like, holy shit.  All right.  Really?  Took it over the top.  And you're like, I don't do it, but I really want to.  And you're like, whoa.  Holy shit.  So I used to get in to go to these meetings because I thought, oh, this is good.  This is exciting times, right?  And so one time I go to go to a meeting and I come in, there's like five fat guys with 
[02:36:00]  bald and moustaches.  I'm like, oh, I've come to fucking pedos anonymous here.  Oh, shit.  So I walk in.  I've turned a little bit late.  And then one guy stands up and he goes, and this is true.  It sounds like a bit, but it's true.  He stands up and he goes, yeah, look, I hide it from my wife.  When she goes to sleep, I go downstairs and do it at parties.  I try to find a corner where I can do it.  And I'm like, yeah, man, I know your pain, right?  And then I stand up and I go, well, for me, it's prostitutes, right? 
[02:36:30]  Everyone stares at me and I go, where am I?  And it turned out I was in O-Reader's Anonymous.  Oh, shit.  I got my AM and my PM mixed up.  I was in the right room, but I was 12 hours late for my meeting.  And then I said, what is this?  And they said, O-Reader's Anonymous.  And I went, that is one of my problems.  But not my biggest problem.  See, when my baby was born, the perfect news story would have been like, 
[02:37:00]  I just would have liked to have seen a news star reader go,  at the Hot Girl Convention in Las Vegas,  there's been a horrible fire and every Hot Girl on the planet is disfigured.  And I'll be like, great, I can focus on being a dad.  Take care of my kid now.  But since there's at least one Hot Girl walking around,  you just can't concentrate on...  Yeah, I can't concentrate fully.  Right, right.  The good thing about a son is that one day you'll understand.  You know what I mean? 
[02:37:30]  You can look at his son and you go, all right, he might hate me right up until 25.  And then you'll have that moment where you're like, oh.  Now I get it.  I get it.  Women are cunts.  And you should spend as much time as possible trying to fuck him over.  So it looks like your relationship's going well.  No, no.  It's going well.  I'm not cheating, man.  I'm fucking...  You're doing good.  I'm doing good.  It's like really rough.  You met her on the show.  You told us.  I met her on the show. 
[02:38:00]  She was the prostitute and the pilot.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It was...  You guys just hit it off.  She's a lovely girl.  And the good thing about her is she's a nice level of fucked up.  She came from a very religious family.  Oh, that'll do it.  So, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's youngest of seven kids.  And the great thing is her mother's really, really, really religious.  Like, brought fucking holy water to when my child was born.  Wow.  And then, like, everyone was like...  I walked in the room and they're sprinkling holy water on the kid. 
[02:38:30]  Everyone freaks out like I'm going to go mental.  And I'm like, eh!  Whatever.  Enjoy your fucking voodoo.  Right?  It's not like you're going against my religion.  Enjoy your fucking voodoo.  I'm an atheist.  Right?  It's not like I'm a Muslim and you're doing the opposite of my religion.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, whatever.  Baptize it.  I'll show up.  Right?  But the...  Oh, fuck. 
[02:39:00]  The mother wouldn't stay with us.  Right?  She came for a month with the baby's going,  she wouldn't stay with us because me and my girlfriend aren't married.  Oh, we're living in sin there.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I need another incentive not to get married.  Yeah.  You're telling me your mother will never stay?  As long as you're not married.  Fuck.  Yes.  That's perfect.  That's perfect.  Fantastic.  Let's not do that.  Any, like, inkling of marriage?  Does she pressure you a little bit?  What I do is, yeah, I'm being pressured to get married, but what I do is, whenever it happens, 
[02:39:30]  I start a fight where I seem like such an arsehole, where it's like, you wouldn't want  to marry that guy.  You wouldn't want to marry this guy.  Brilliant.  And then I work my relationship back up to a reasonable level.  And then I...  That's brilliant.  Fucking Jim.  Then I drag it back down to the ground, right?  Right, right, right.  I try to keep the embers just unmarried, but not enough for you to leave me.  That's fucking great.  Holy shit. 
[02:40:00]  You know, Jim Jeffries is here for a very special day, you know that way.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, it's Meatball Day, apparently.  Oh.  Yeah.  You like meatballs?  These guys.  I did.  I brought the guy, the head of AEG with me, because he does my tours, because he heard  about Meatball Day.  Meatball Day.  He heard about Meatball Day.  Yeah, because Roland's mentioning Meatball Day.  Meatball Day is fucking wonderful.  Roland's a foodie.  Oh, he certainly is.  If you lay him on his side, he's a bit of a rollie as well.  I love that term, foodie. 
[02:40:30]  I like food as well.  Get Roland in here with meatballs.  But it is the fat man way of saying, ah!  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I like a good meal.  I certainly do.  Yeah.  It's like if I ever tried to go, I'm a drunkie.  I'm a drunkie.  What a cute name for an alcoholic.  That's why I have a red nose.  Ah, shit.  Because of my drunkie problems.  You've had to cut back on your party and stuff, obviously, with a kid and a show. 
[02:41:00]  I didn't drink during the filming of the show.  Uh-huh.  And then I had the kid and then I took it up a little bit again.  And then I'm just no good at it anymore.  Oh, really?  You are such a pro.  The hangovers are so...  But I'm thinking...  I do this thing.  Rather than giving it up, I'm thinking, maybe if I just drink beer.  Right?  I've never been crazy on beer.  Right.  I've been leglessly drunk, but I don't get my dick out on beer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so...  But the beer usually leads to other... 
[02:41:30]  To fatness.  Yeah.  It leads to fatness.  And also, it gets you to the point where you're not thinking about not drinking something  else.  Yeah.  So you drink the beer, you get a little buzz, and you're like, oh, what the hell, this  one time.  Jack and Coke or something.  But kids don't understand hangovers there, Jim Jefferies.  No.  So that probably helps you out a little bit.  No, my kid has a system where when he wakes up in the morning...  So he sleeps for eight hours, but it's that stupid fucking shit with kids where it's like,  can we stop putting him to bed at seven?  Then he wouldn't wake up at four. 
[02:42:00]  Right?  Let him stay up late.  Yeah, but everyone's like, he's way past his bedtime.  Nope.  Are we sure about this?  Let's put him to bed at one so we can all sleep till nine.  Why the fuck wouldn't you do that?  I don't know, but...  Ten o'clock in our family.  We figure that shit out a little bit.  Are you dead?  Ten?  Yes.  Well, we've got him...  Kicks him in bed a little longer.  We've got him back till nine and all that type of stuff now, but it's...  I want beef.  Just beef.  All right.  So...  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  Where's this from?  Who are we...  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Meatball Obsession.  Yeah, we're doing an honoring National Meatball Day, which starts tomorrow.  Today and tomorrow, we're doing a buy one, get one free on all the meatballs.  Are you fucking kidding?  It's National Meatball Day tomorrow?  I haven't bought a tree yet.  Oh, God, dude, God.  These holidays sneak up on you, don't they?  They sure do, Jim.  You know, back in World War II, the Japanese were called meatballs. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah?  Are you?  Yeah, they called them meatball.  Fucking meatball.  Because they flew those zeros, and they had those goddamn Japanese flags on there with  the big red circle.  Like a meatball.  Just a little meatball history for you.  Or meatball day.  Well, meatball history.  This is tomorrow.  So you do kamikaze meatballs and just throw meatballs?  Yes!  All right.  I always do that.  Period shakes.  Cook the meatballs.  A Japanese flag, yeah.  Yeah, period shakes.  It's like I made a fucking Japanese flag out of the bed last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's Meatball Obsession guy going?  One bomb and he's out of here? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  All right, all right.  Get back in there.  Try again.  Oh, these are so frozen.  What am I eating?  Well, that's the beef meatball and sauce, and then we also have turkey here.  Turkey is pretty good, too.  Don't you mix the beef and the pork together?  No, we do all of them.  Not all.  We do all of them.  Yeah.  And the sauce.  That's the way my grandmother did.  That's the way I do it.  Yeah, the sauce is good, too, man.  Thank you.  Roland's doing a food show tomorrow, right, Roland?  I'm good.  Yeah.  What time is your food show?  I'm from five to six.  Five to six tomorrow on this channel.  Roland has a bunch of fucking famous chefs and people coming in. 
[02:44:00]  So let me get this right.  These are all your grandmother's recipes.  Yes.  And so you've started a big business off your grandmother's ideas.  Yeah.  Well, the parent company is called Mama Mancini's, and you get these in all supermarkets, and I  open a restaurant in Manhattan, serving them in cups.  This is the deal, right?  If I opened up a business with my grandmother's ideas, it would be called Racism Obsession.  That's the only business I could open.  That's it?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Does she really, uh...  Does she get a taste, or did you wait for her to, you know, go to the other side?  Yeah, she's gone a long time.  Smart.  Wow.  That means you get to keep more of the profits.  Yeah, that's it.  No, yeah, smart.  Wait till the grandmother dies.  Then dig through her drawer for the recipes.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Starts jumping in trying to get a piece of your pie over there.  Like a piece of your meatball.  What was your grandmother's most hated race?  The whites.  She was colorblind.  No, I, um...  She hated, uh... 
[02:45:00]  What did she call them?  Gooks?  Chinks?  Oh, she didn't like Asians.  She didn't like the Asians, no.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Wow.  And she would just, like...  What was her problem with them?  Well, Australia's different...  See, we have Asian immigrants in the same way that, say, Texas and L.A. and all that  have Mexican immigrants.  Oh, okay.  So, they're our nearest neighbors.  Oh, yeah.  Go back to the South Pacific, don't I know.  Yeah, all the illegals are mostly Asian people.  So, there's a bit of that.  And then there's also, you know, the war. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, that whole thing.  Yeah, where the Japanese weren't the best of people, were they?  You got this little refined culture, these gentle people.  They had war atrocities against soldiers.  Yeah, yeah.  That was as bad as the Nazis against the Jews.  Yeah.  You know, and there was meant to be a thing where you didn't...  We all know it's meant to be like Hogan's Heroes, right?  Sure.  You're meant to get locked up and have a funny time.  Some laughs.  And some laughs and have a...  You leave the camp every so often. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  You pull some shenanigans, you come back.  Exactly.  Or even like where you get to whistle a little bit and, you know, the Great Escape where you  have fun digging tunnels.  Nothing like the Bataan Death March.  Yeah, but it turns out the Japanese weren't into that.  They were into...  Yeah.  They were into beatings.  Getting a history lesson today.  So, yeah, she didn't like them.  Did she grow up in that time?  Yeah.  In that time?  In the Second World War, of course.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  She should be in a... 
[02:46:30]  Excuse me, my father's 73.  Wow.  Okay.  She'd be 100 by now.  Wow.  She died in her 90s.  She was...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But she used to...  Did she relate some of the stories of World War II?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like how fucking...  Yeah, I mean, like it's always...  We haven't had a Great War, have we?  These modern day wars aren't as fun as the...  We need like a great supervillain.  Now that we've got Bin Laden...  I met the guy who shot Bin Laden.  You did?  Did you really?  I met the actual guy, guys. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  How?  He's a...  There's a story there.  Well, he's a friend of a friend.  The thing is, the guy who's one of the producers on the TV show, he's producing a movie with  this guy, and this guy and three others who were on the mission, they...  I can't say their names or anything like that, but the guys that were on the mission, they're  getting movie...  They're advisors on films that involve soldiers.  So it was on set, they all came down and...  Wow.  Yeah, I met the guy, yeah.  What kind of guy was he? 
[02:47:30]  Did he say anything about it?  Short gook.  That's what he was.  No.  God damn.  Sorry, Grandma.  Sorry, I did that one for you.  She'd love you for it.  No, he was...  He was Teddy Tough Nuts.  He was the type of guy you wouldn't fuck with.  Right.  He was built in cowboy boots and...  Not that cowboy boots make for toughness.  No, for a bunch.  Cowboy boots can go either way.  Right.  Cowboy boots...  If you're a fuck...  I've got a pair of cowboy boots.  I always look like a faggot. 
[02:48:00]  Right?  But, like, some guys put cowboy boots on and you're like,  I wouldn't fuck with that guy.  That guy looks tough.  You've got all of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got all of the cowboy boots.  Did you ask him anything or did he discuss what...  I don't know if I'm at liberty to say, but he...  He did an interview and talked about...  He step-by-step said he went in there, saw Bin Laden,  the wife was in front of him, he shot him right in the fucking head.  He said he wasn't sure that it was him to begin with.  It wasn't until he shot him and he went,  Oh!  Hey! 
[02:48:30]  Jackpot!  Yeah!  That's the guy!  Whoa!  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking wild, man.  And we were looking for him for so fucking long, man.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, we knew where he was the whole time, Jim Jefferies.  Yeah, but they had to make that movie longer.  That's right.  That's right.  How old the guy is he?  About...  40.  He's not young, young.  Really?  He wasn't.  He might be 35.  35?  Mm.  Interesting.  Wow, fuck.  I would have pegged him as a little younger, but...  Yeah, no, there was... 
[02:49:00]  I don't know anymore what people's ages are.  You know when you watch...  He said, leave him to some...  I love fucking Jim.  You know when you watch sport, right?  Yeah.  And I looks like...  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, hold on.  Oh, hold on.  Hold that thought.  Hold on that thought.  Hold that goddamn thought.  We're losing Meatball Guy.  Yeah, Meatball Guy's gotta go.  You gotta go, Meatball Guy.  No, I'm gonna sit outside, I guess.  All right.  No, you can't wait to see me.  You can sit there where it turns out.  I was gonna sit in a few minutes.  There's more about...  Is it coming up?  Oh, we gotta take a break, too.  The original Meatball in a Cup.  That's it.  Love it.  14th and 6th. 
[02:49:30]  14th and 6th Avenue.  And mamamancini's.com for my wholesale meatballs.  I'm gonna start selling meatballs in a cone.  There you go.  What if they go to Meatball Obsession, which is a lot easier to remember?  Meatballobsession.com, right.  That'll get to your stuff?  Yes.  Your other stuff?  And the other company is Mama Mancini's, which I sell to supermarkets around the country.  Wow, good for you, Sam.  Thank you.  Start delivering sauce to my building for me, please.  It's very good.  Let's get on a regular schedule.  Yeah, I can't stop eating this.  All right, let's get that done, Sam.  Plug all the camera up.  It's not a pretty sauce for the lobster. 
[02:50:00]  You should put these with spaghetti.  That's what we have, Bevel.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks for the tip.  Can someone trade Mark that?  I just came up with spaghetti and meatballs.  That's crazy.  I don't think anyone came up with that.  I don't think they'll catch on.  Oh, your story about sport and people's ages before we go to break.  It's like when you go watch a game, everyone who's playing in the teams is like 26, but  I still look at them as being older than me.  Yeah.  Because there's that still stupid bit where you still look up to them.  Right.  And there's no one younger that you look up to in this world, except for athletes.  And growing up, they all were older than you. 
[02:50:30]  They were all old, and they looked really old when you were growing up, because it was  all like big moustaches and shit when we were young, right?  Yeah.  But now, I think it's also a bit of your brain thinks, oh, I've still got a shot at playing  professional sport.  Yeah.  Like your brain goes, maybe one day I'll just be, you know, playing basketball and some  guy will spot me and just go, have you ever tried it out for?  You're good.  Yeah.  And movies like The Rookie, that Dennis Quaid movie, where he's like, he was 34. 
[02:51:00]  Right, right, right.  I'm a little too old for that.  Yeah.  But there's bits where you go, well, he did it.  You never know.  You never know.  It could happen.  The right circumstances.  Like, maybe I'll break my arm, and there'll be a tendon in my arm that will make me throw  like something, and everything will just turn around for me.  Yeah.  I won't be uncoordinated.  That doesn't happen.  Not with that fucking attitude.  You do reach a point where you think, like, of all the things you can't do now, if you 
[02:51:30]  just had no ties to anything, nothing, and you're 21 years old, you could pretty much  try to do anything, whether you're good at it or not.  Like, okay, I want to fucking fly F-18s.  All right, I'm going to go through all the motions.  And you can, if you, you know, go through all the motions.  Then you start reaching these ages where it's like, oh, you're not even allowed to  do that anymore.  Part of the reason that I don't want to fuck around to my girlfriend is, I'm not good at 
[02:52:00]  it anymore.  I used to be an excellent fuck.  Now, it's like, if you even get me on top of you for a bit, congratulations.  You pulled a hammy and it never healed.  Oh, shit.  I had that cramp afterwards where you had to rub my thigh.  Like, uh, you just got no stamina anymore.  I can't get on top like that.  That way you're doing the push-up.  Push-up.  Yeah, you got to go with push-ups.  Like, are you fucking kidding me?  I'm an excellent spoon fucker. 
[02:52:30]  You know what I am?  You know what I am?  You know what I am?  I can get good leverage that way.  Just on your side.  You know, that gives the appearance of, imagine that we're all up and standing.  Because it's, it's, it's the, I don't think oxymorons are the right word.  It's, it's the dilemma that I used to be as fit as a fiddle but cum really quickly.  Now I'm like so unfit and can't cum.  And so, so like I'm just fucking and fucking, I'm dying. 
[02:53:00]  Like my actual lung capacity is packed in and my balls aren't shit anything else.  Oh my God.  We have a timing issue.  We got to take a break.  Unfortunately.  And we got to read that too.  All right.  Mask Sexual Flavors is the new way for foreplay.  Available in four tantalizing flavors.

[02:53:30]  Jim, you sticking around for Terrence Howard?  Yeah, man.  All right, cool.  And meatball guy, what are you doing?  I'm going to hang out outside, I guess.  All right.  Meatball Obsession dot com.  Thank you so much.  We'll be back with Terrence Howard.  This is the OPN at 3 Show.  The OPN at 3 Show.  Oh, very cool.  Jim Jeffrey's still in studio.  All right.  Meatball guy left with his Meatball Obsession business. 
[02:54:00]  And he has been replaced by Terrence Howard.  Terrence Howard is here.  I'm the new meatball.  Who's beyond cool.  I know, right?  He has us cracking up before we even start.  And this guy's sharp.  He's dressed like so sharp.  You're making us look really bad.  Dressed like that.  They look bad every day.  Y'all mama made y'all look bad.  Look at that perfect suit on this guy.  Perfect.  He's even got like the handkerchief in the pocket.  I know.  He's got that look.  And he can pull it off. 
[02:54:30]  You're doing a lot of press, though, right?  Yeah, it's just killing you.  You know, I was supposed to be in Mexico right now getting in trouble.  Oh, man.  And they called and said, no, you've got to come and promote this movie.  And I'm out here doing this stuff.  You know, Colin's going to make all the money from it.  No money's going to make all the money from it.  No money's coming to me.  So everybody out there, go see Dead Man Down and tell him they should send Terrence some money.  It's coming out tonight.  There's advertisement for you.  Getting good reviews.  It is.  Our paper's giving it the good reviews.  Yeah, no. 
[02:55:00]  Here in New York.  They did this.  Niels Arden did his thing.  And then Colin, you know, the Irish, there's something about the Irish.  I don't know, they steal all the women, they take all the alcohol, and they have all,  they get all, you know, they're okay.  You're okay if you're Irish and you're drunk, it's great.  Then it's fine, yeah.  If you're a black man and you're drunk, you're lazy, right?  What's that about?  This is the thing about Colin Farrell, like, his whole career he's been like,  I'm so cool, I'm so fucking cool, I'm smoking, I'm, you know, smoking on TV.  You know when you're smoking on TV and you're looking fucking cool, right? 
[02:55:30]  But then, I watched the documentary on the cunt, he used to be a line dance instructor.  Was he?  Sam, he's fucking doubling.  There's pictures of even a cowboy having chaps making fat Irish women dance.  Different guy, huh?  Yeah, not as tough as you think.  I didn't see that, I didn't know that.  I want to get one of those pictures.  Someone Google that.  Yeah, you need a picture of that.  There'll be a picture of it.  Oh, I believe it.  We'll find it.  He's got a reputation for being a little out there.  Well, he's had some fun, man. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's had some fun, but he's calmed down a lot.  I mean, he gave me a lot of freaking advice when he was losing his girlfriend.  Oh, shit.  But he always has 20 new girls to come and get to him.  No doubt.  You know, because he's, what's up with these Widow's Peak and the handsome white dudes, man?  I got white in me.  I got a Widow's Peak.  I see a Widow's Peak, man.  Come on.  No, they painted that in this morning, man.  Something tells me you probably, you know, did just fine for yourself.  Yeah, I did all right. 
[02:56:30]  I did all right.  Yeah, over the years, I'm sure.  What do you do these days as far as relationship?  What's that situation like?  Well, no, I've started counseling with my wife.  You know, we're considering whether we can reconcile or not.  Is that work?  That counseling stuff?  Hell no, it doesn't work.  I think the judge looks at it more favorably.  Oh, okay.  Like you gave it a shot.  Like you tried and gave it a shot.  I've done that.  I've been to that with girlfriends.  With girlfriends?  No, well, you... 
[02:57:00]  Counseling with girls.  Current girlfriend with a child.  Oh, okay.  Baby mama.  That's what we got, baby mama.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You go along to the counselor.  The counselor agrees with you, like,  maybe you're acting like a bit of a bitch and Jim isn't a bad guy, right?  And you walk out of the castle and you're like,  I think I'm winning.  I think I'm winning.  I think I'm winning.  And then she's like,  we're not going to see that guy again.  That guy's an idiot.  Right?  And then you go to some woman and the woman's like,  no, he's a scumbag.  And you're like, ah, shit.  No, see what I hate about counseling?  You go in there and the guy tells you, 
[02:57:30]  look, you have to pick a time in which you're going to discuss certain topics.  You can't argue all day.  You can't jump out and bushwhack somebody every five minutes with an argument or a problem.  You've got to pick a time.  Five minutes every two or three hours to have this conversation.  But we walk out of there and every girl that I've ever gone with counseling with,  we come out there and she goes right into the same stuff.  It's like, do you have a mind?  We just gave this man $500. 
[02:58:00]  You didn't listen at all.  You didn't listen to him.  Okay.  Okay.  I know what to do.  I'm going to roll a joint next time.  And we just go sit there.  You know how they used to do counseling?  They used to give MD&A in the 50s.  You'll go in there if you were in merit counseling and they will give you a pill.  Both of you appeal.  You go home.  They tell you to take the pill.  And a half hour later, talk about what's going on.  Really?  That's where it all came from.  I wish they did it like how they do it in Saudi Arabia.  Stoning. 
[02:58:30]  There's no enough stoning counseling.  The ridiculous thing is thinking that anyone can tell you to be rational when you're in  an emotional, irrational moment.  The reason you're arguing is because you can't think rationally.  So they tell you, five minutes.  Put it at five minutes.  Do you think you're actually going to be making your point and then look at your watch and go,  honey, we've got to stop.  We've got to stop.  That's five minutes. 
[02:59:00]  Exactly.  It's always like, take a deep breath.  They don't take a deep breath.  They over talk you the whole freaking time.  You're trying to be calm.  Like, look, I'm trying to be a gentle man.  And then you walk from the bathroom into the kitchen trying to get away from you.  Then you walk into the bedroom and they're still right there.  Then you walk into the living room and then they take the remote from you and they corner  you and then when you yell back, you are a monster.  Now you're the monster.  And then you go put your legs on and you shoot the bitch through the bathroom door. 
[02:59:30]  And then you say, you didn't know that she was, you didn't, you thought she was a burglar.  You thought she was a burglar.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Or you can get stabbed 27 times and shot in the head.  That was a crazy story.  She's batshit crazy, that one.  Oh, but they can get away with it.  Look at Lorena Babbitt.  She didn't go to jail.  No, no.  But let a man do that to a woman.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a hard time. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, my God.  Speaking of making your brains out.  Opie, when you had kids, did you go to parenting classes?  Yeah, in the beginning.  Yeah, we went to one, right?  And they had this video where there's this guy and they're like, hey, everyone, don't shake  babies.  And I'm like taking the piss.  I'm like, can someone get me a pen?  So I can write it down.  You know that.  And then they got this guy in the video that's like, when you feel like shaking the baby,  count to 10.  Then don't. 
[03:00:30]  Who wants to shake a baby?  You shake a martini.  No, no, no.  I want to shake a baby.  I tell you what, I dream about shaking my fucking baby in the middle of the night.  I don't do it because I'm a rational person.  Okay, all right, but you think about it.  In my belly.  I'd love to, I would love to just do it during like a lullaby.  Like, go to sleep, you know, fucking count.  Keep the money.  I want your baby.  Holy cow. 
[03:01:00]  They will challenge you, those babies.  You understand why some parents lose their fucking minds.  No, you got to get back to smacking your kid in the mouth.  You know, the way they used to do, you know, when I was a kid, I got smacked in the mouth  all the time.  All the time.  I turned out all right.  I got my ass whooped at least three times a day.  My father would come home.  Dude, I know you did something.  Get your ass over.  Come here.  Come here.  And he used to whoop us with these laughs, you know, that they put the plaster on, those  little fan pieces.  Oh, shit. 
[03:01:30]  And he'd whoop us on our thighs because my daddy was a Muslim.  Holy shit.  He'd whoop us on the bottom of our feet and our thighs.  And I turned out all right.  You're fine.  And how does that make you feel?  And do you find that that has affected your relationship today?  Oh, boy.  That's a psychobabble.  No, I knew I did something wrong when I felt the wrath of the belt.  The belt?  You know?  Yeah.  Oh, my dad had his belt.  And he'd come in and give us a few whacks with that thing.  And then if we were, like, almost bad enough to get hit, he would hang the belt on the  bedroom door. 
[03:02:00]  And that buckle would, like, glimmer in the light like a warning.  Like, there it is.  And that was good enough.  I'll tell you what.  You haven't lived until you've had a 300 to 400-pound woman who just...  Jim's mom.  That's my whole sentence.  No, no, no.  You haven't lived until...  My mother, this is her trick, right?  You'd do something, you'd break something, and then you'd be like, fuck, am I in trouble?  She'd be like, nah, you're not in trouble.  Everything's fine.  And then she'd leave it till 3 a.m., and she'd wake you up to a beating. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  Wow.  That's cruel.  If you had a black grandmother, you know those extension cords?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  We didn't have any extension cords in the house.  I'd cut them in half, because they would beat the shit out of you with an extension cord.  They didn't have the audacity to rub butter on you after that.  Now, baby.  Now, baby.  You know you shouldn't have done that.  Come on over here.  You know you'll do it again.  I'm going to whoop your ass again.  Now, get over here.  That's right.  That is...  That's mean, man.  Wow.  That's torturous.  I once laid my mother out, punched her in the stomach when I was a teenager, and she 
[03:03:00]  hit the ground like a bag of shit.  And to this day, I have no problem with it.  I'm kind of proud of it.  She used to hit me every day.  That tactic, though, is like when you get people that are held hostage, and the guy goes,  you'll go home today.  And they put you in the car, give you your civvies, drive you around the block, and you're  like, wait a minute, we're going back.  Yes, you'll not go home today.  That is torturous.  Do you watch Locked Up Abroad? 
[03:03:30]  That's psycho.  Oh, of course, yeah.  That's the best show on TV.  It's amazing.  I locked up Abroad once.  Oh, yeah.  Me and Rick James.  Yeah, that's frightening.  That's a frightening show.  I want to talk more about Dead Man Down over here.  Dead Man Down.  That's what we're talking about.  Yeah, we're talking about Dead Man Down.  Dead Man Down is basically Dead Man Down.  And before they had Viagra, it was Dead Man Down.  Now Dead Man Standing, The Resurrection. 
[03:04:00]  So what's the gist of the movie?  What are we getting?  The movie is just about the revenge that we have, like him beating the shit out of his  mama?  I beat the shit out of him.  He upped it a little bit for you.  I got him one in the bread basket.  One in the bread basket.  You knocked the wind out of her.  I wouldn't call that a beating.  It's just about revenge.  You got Numi's character that's out for revenge for the person that messed up her face when really 
[03:04:30]  it was her daddy.  You know, well, not her daddy.  She's a beautiful girl.  I shouldn't have said that.  I love her.  Numi.  You're out there.  But no, and then you've got Colin's character who has lost his entire family.  And everybody's looking for revenge.  And you've got my character, who's just a nice black guy in the movie that's trying to  be upscale in the middle of a white neighborhood.  And you've got people that's throwing shit on top of me like it's my fault.  I didn't do anything to anybody, but why do people keep fucking with me?  That's what the movie should be. 
[03:05:00]  That's what it should be.  Right, right.  Because I remember that character.  That sounded familiar.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, Jimmy Norton isn't here.  He's a huge fan.  I love you.  Obviously, he talks about your role in Crash all the time, which was fucking fantastic.  Yeah, that was great to watch my wife get molested.  That was a great experience.  I love that moment.  That's a tough scene.  That is a tough, tough scene.  That's a real tough scene.  And Matt Dillon did not pull back a punch. 
[03:05:30]  You know, sometimes an actor, if they've got to hit you, they'd be like, look, I'm sorry,  man.  It might hurt a little bit.  But Matt was sitting there molesting my wife, looking at me, you like this, don't you?  You want me to do it to you?  Wow.  And I'm about to whip this white boy's ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's like when my dog fucks his shoe.  What?  You know when your dog fucks his shoe and stares at you?  Like, this is what I'm going to do to you.  You got some crazy shit going on with you, man.  Oh, my God.  He looks at you when he's doing it. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, Jeffrey.  Give me the stink eye.  I knew this dog that used to do that to everybody.  And then there's this little kid.  I was like seven.  But it was this six-year-old girl.  And the dog's name was Chewy.  And when the dog jumped on her, now we told her, we just said, just stay still, knowing  that the dog would keep humping her.  But you knew that shit was cool.  It was cool, man.  You knew it's seven.  Unbelievable, man. 
[03:06:30]  Now the movie's going to fucking do very well.  Yeah.  No one's going to see that dumb Oz movie.  They're going to see this thing.  The Oz movie looks shit, doesn't it?  Well, it's getting zero stars.  It's too much CGI.  Zero stars.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's like, we know the story.  Nah.  Nah, you're going to bring the wizard.  It's going to be before that.  You're going to try to kill the witch.  We know you don't fucking kill her.  She's in the next movie.  Are we still talking about women?  It's more about Caslite. 
[03:07:00]  He's helping out your movie, Terrence.  Holy shit.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I can tell you what happens.  I bet you the wizard stays.  Yeah, you bet.  Yeah, he probably stays there.  There really wouldn't be any surprises.  Maybe they kill the wizard and a new one takes his place.  Hell no.  You know who takes his place?  Alphonse.  Alphonse.  In this movie.  Yeah.  Dead Man Down takes it.  Yes.  Wizard of Oz.  Who gives a damn about the Wizard of Oz?  Fuck that.  You know, they didn't even bring the midgets back.  Nope.  What was that about? 
[03:07:30]  That was my biggest complaint with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Yeah.  No dwarfs, no ticket money for me.  No.  You can't bring out one dwarf.  Hollywood figured out we can handle one dwarf.  People will handle one dwarf.  People go crazy for a load of dwarfs, man.  I tell you what, I played the Little People's Convention of America at the Marriott in Anaheim.  You did?  I have a dwarf friend, Brad Williams, who's a comic, and he said, I got this gig.  I tell you what, man. 
[03:08:00]  There was so many dwarfs, and they all go to just fuck each other, right?  Because it's like a convention of them.  And it's like an even playing field.  Right, right.  And they're quite open.  They don't have to compete with normal-sized people.  My dwarf friend, Brad, the thing that he said was wrong, he goes, because there was kid  dwarfs and everything like that.  He goes, the biggest problem he has is, you know when you look at it like a child who's  a dwarf, he goes, I can't tell whether it's a child or an adult either.  Like, he's a dwarf.  He'll be chatting to a girl that he thinks is like 25, and he'll be like, oh, so you're 
[03:08:30]  11.  Oh, well, just because we were the same height, but I thought, uh, but I'll tell you something,  dwarf kids, like little kids, like five-year-old dwarfs, fucking adorable, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Are you talking about primordial dwarfs?  Like little, yeah, with the big foreheads and little teeth.  Yeah, there's like this, there's 200 different types of dwarfism, so we have the whole mixed  bag here, right?  But, but it makes you not want to have a regular kid. 
[03:09:00]  Really?  Oh, if you had one of them in your house.  You know, a little baby dwarf?  It's like, it's like if your baby was walking.  Like your baby, they're outrageously good, the little dwarfs.  Terrence might have tapped out on this one.  Did you all remember?  No, no, no.  Do you all remember that Randy Newman song?  I really do.  Short people got nobody.  Right.  That was a mean song.  Apparently so.  A lot of people didn't like it.  I really didn't make that up.  I really did do that gig.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was a giant, I saw these, they put this game room up for all the dwarf kids, 
[03:09:30]  like video games and stuff.  I'm a pinball nut, and they had a couple of pinball machines there.  I thought, why the fuck aren't these kids playing the pinball machines?  Oh, no.  It takes two dwarf children to play a pinball machine.  Really?  Because their arms don't reach around.  They have to do like a three-legged one flipper at a time.  I'm not laughing.  See, he's tapping out, I think.  Oh, he's trying to be cool, but I think he's tapping out.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this. 
[03:10:00]  He was all right when I punched my mother.  No.  I was not.  I guess, I, you know, yesterday, for the first time, I, I never had a, um, a sexual attraction  to, you know, to a little person like that.  But yesterday, I saw a little person, you know, he was quite cute.  They had a few of the porn star ones there.  Porn stars.  Oh, wow.  There's a lot of porn star dwarfs, man.  Big industry.  Yeah, there are.  Big industry.  And we had a few of those little hoochie fucking porn star chicks. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was quite the scene.  There's a few that, well, obviously the little one from, um, what was that?  Uh, Total Recall, the little blonde one.  Uh, oh, yeah, the original one.  Yeah, the original.  Yeah, she was kind of, you know, you looked and went, ah, you know, I might throw that  one a little flip.  We had a bad, flip.  We had a bad experience with a dwarf on our show.  She thought she wanted to be a stripper, and we go, ah, come on in.  We'll see if you're doing everything right.  Oh, we had an audition for us.  Right.  She got up on, like, one of the consoles. 
[03:11:00]  On the console.  And started dancing, and, uh, then she burst into tears.  Oh, it was very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  She realized, I guess, that she didn't want to be a stripper.  Who consoled her?  Which one of you consoled her?  It might have been Jack Black.  He was in that day.  And, uh.  Jack Black used to do the show.  Yeah, and, uh, Colin was into, uh.  And, uh, Tom Hanks' son.  Colin Hanks, yeah.  It was a weird day.  But she, uh.  That wasn't I.  She decided she didn't want to be a stripper.  So we helped her out in the end.  Yeah.  I'm sure you guys have, um, the Miss Delaware thing, right? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did a routine on my last special, which was about when I was fucking Michael Phelps' ex-girlfriend.  Which he did, by the way, Turner.  Wow, for the record.  And I was, and, like, the thing was, she broke up with Michael because Michael cheated on her with Miss America.  And my joke was, Miss California.  And I said, well, I would, I could never do that to you.  I said, it's not that I wouldn't.  I just couldn't.  You couldn't, right.  It's Miss California.  That bitch has got to be fucking tasty, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a minor celebrity. 
[03:12:00]  I could cheat on you with, say, Miss Delaware, right?  I just said that as a throwaway thing.  You had 50 states to choose from, and you chose the one.  I called it.  You called it.  Before it happened.  As soon as, as soon as that story broke, I had a thousand Twitters going, maybe you  could fuck Miss Delaware.  Yeah.  Wow.  If I had 200 bucks on the camera, sure.  I've been trying to get her attention and get her to follow me on Twitter.  So all the fans have just been talking about what a great guy I am.  And I got a DM from her that was like, who are you? 
[03:12:30]  Well, the thing is, is she taking a full point?  She's a shit fuck.  I don't care.  I think she's adorable.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Did you not?  Even a shit fuck is a great fuck.  Did you orgasm?  Let me say it politically correct.  Did you arrive?  When I was masturbating to it.  Oh, okay.  Well, I didn't fuck her.  I just watched the point.  Yes, I did.  But I had to put a lot of work into it.  He wants to know what a shit fuck is.  A shit fuck is someone who's not a good fuck.  But he's saying if you're not, what's the difference?  A bad fuck is a good fuck. 
[03:13:00]  Do you always not?  That's what he's saying.  Do you always not?  Insert, withdraw, repeat.  I'll tell you the only good fuck I know.  That's the goal.  Right?  That's why we're here.  I'm not doing it for a resume.  The only great fuck that I know is me.  Because I'm the only one who always makes me cum.  I, I, I.  I, you need some therapy a little bit.  I've got a great therapist that's been helping me deal with some childhood trauma and issues. 
[03:13:30]  You know.  Yeah.  Have you ever been like with a therapist where you've talked about your childhood and they've gone,  Jesus.  You do not want that.  No, no, no.  They tell you, I'm sorry that happened to you.  I don't do that with you.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I heard one was like, you know that's not normal.  Wow.  And they've heard it all.  Well, that's why I'm fucking here talking to you in the first place.  Something's not right.  Don't make me feel worse by thinking I'm the one real lunatic you've ever spoken to. 
[03:14:00]  My mother used to do a thing when we were kids.  She used to take me and my brothers down.  And it sort of worked.  Me and my brothers are very successful.  We come from a very working class family.  But she used to take us, you know, summer holidays down to the, down to it.  Oh, this can't be good.  No, no.  It's not that bad.  It's just a story.  Hold on.  Let me get the lunch in.  Every Jim Jeffy story starts out sweet.  No, no, no.  This is a very quick one.  It's not that bad.  His mom getting it in the bread.  She used to take us to a factory where you'd watch, like, some, like, mentally challenged  person just putting lids on a container just over and over and over again. 
[03:14:30]  She'd make you stare at that for four or five hours, constantly whispering in your ear,  that's what will happen to you if you don't work hard.  Wow.  Right?  And look at what happened.  And I always, and I told that to the therapist, like, like, see, my mom did some good things.  And the therapist was like.  Oh, like that was a good thing?  Yeah, because I didn't do it.  No, that's psychopathic.  I'll fuck you with your work ethic.  I only just found that out.  That's a bad day for a kid.  She deserved another punch that day. 
[03:15:00]  Another punch to the bread basket.  Do they have you registered in your neighborhood?  Yeah.  No shit.  Are you one of those dot people?  Yeah.  Yeah, Terrence has to go.  Terrence, man.

All right.  It's Tommy Davidson right there.  What?  It's Tommy Davidson.  Where?  He was just in here asking for a pic.  It's crazy.  What was he doing?  I don't know.  Was he in the whole time?  He was asking Tommy Davidson for a pic.  Was he in the whole time in the corner? 
[03:18:00]  No, he was outside.  He's a black thing, man.  Yo, what are you doing, Tommy?  Yeah, there he is.  It's not a black thing.  It's not a black thing.  He got a pic.  I know, right?  Yeah, he got the whole Hebrew for a pic.  Fucking Tommy Davidson.  Later, Tommy.  Right?  Fucking when she turned around.  She's got a nice...  Like this close to full of a cock in.  A weird end to the show.  I really was just like...  What the fuck just happened?  What a great Friday show, man. 
[03:18:30]  That's what's her name from Extra?  Maria Menounos.  Yeah, yeah.  Goddamn, Jim Jeffries, you fucking...  Huh?  Kill me.  Hilarious today.  That's very cool.  Holy shit.  And then Terrence Howard killing it.  I thought he was going to be a stiff...  I thought he was going to talk about acting.  I thought he was going to be very serious, monotone.  He's out of his fucking mind.  He's out of his mind.  Holy shit.  He didn't tap out once.  What is it?  From Heather B.  What is it?  The real world.  Pineapple martinis.  All right.  She said to give one to you. 
[03:19:00]  What?  They're drinking martinis on there?  Holy shit.  Friday.  Gin and juice.  Gin and juice.  Make sure you got one.  All right, thank you.  Thank you, Heather B.  From the original real world.  You can do that with anything.  It's Monday.  I'm getting over the weekend.  That's it.  Holy shit.  I don't know what the fuck just happened, but that was cool shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a block.  She was foxy, man.  She was foxy.  And you don't need shit like that in your face, man.  You're trying to keep from fucking women.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It doesn't matter how hot your girlfriend is or anything like that. 
[03:19:30]  It just doesn't matter.  You get bored of fucking all of them.  It's amazing, right?  Yeah.  No one's fucking...  All these sitcoms over the years where it's like the husband's like,  can we have sex?  And the wife's like, not today.  You're like, that's fucking bullshit.  The only sitcom that was almost a reality show,  and it looked like it was married with children.  Right, yeah.  Where the wife was like, can we fuck?  And he's there going,  and she was way hotter than him. 
[03:20:00]  And he'd be like,  and he'd go up the stairs,  and he's like,  and I got it.  Yes.  It doesn't matter.  I should have fucking gotten a chick who was as ugly as sin,  but really funny.  And good to hang out with.  Right?  But instead I chose like a dumb girl who's kind of hot.  Because I thought that would make me happy.  And it did for like six months.  I fucking, I'm telling you,  just pick someone fucking ugly that you get along with.  Because that's all, 
[03:20:30]  you're never going to enjoy fucking anyone for more than six months.  Sound advice, Jim Jefferies.  Holy shit.  Jim Jefferies.  I love it.  Fucking never disappoints.  God damn.  Dude, you were beyond hilarious today.  Oh.  All right.  We got to go.  I guess we're out of here.  Have a great weekend, everybody.  Yep.  See you.  Monday is Dave Lee Roth Day.  Fuck yeah.  What happened?  Tuesday is Dave Lee Roth Day.  I got the headphones still on.  It's not bad.  You're all right.  Oh, it's pretty bad. 
[03:21:00]  You go, it's not bad.  Oh, it's pretty bad.  Holy fuck, dude.  I thought we were done.  Yeah, we were until you started talking.  I don't walk around like this.  It's all right.  You weren't really on mic.  Love you, honey.  All right.  I don't walk around like this with a microphone two inches from our face and headphones on.  It's pretty bad anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of your new material.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Working it out here on the show.  I like it.  Yeah, it was very good.  It's fucking funny.  It'll work. 
[03:21:30]  David Lee Roth on Monday.  That's going to be fucking cool, man.  Yeah.  David Lee Roth, right?  Yeah.  Yep.  Enjoy your week.  All right.  Later, man.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:22:00]  And look who's still here.  Not so much after.  What happened?  Because Opie's still in the building.  I'm trying to, I'm just trying to tweet a picture.  A little tough for you?  You've done it before.  Dude, I'm like, I wasn't going to come in today.  I am so fucking glad I came in.  You're not even supposed to be here today.  But I'm so glad I came in.  That was amazing radio.  It was a great show.  Top to bottom.  I think the first hour with my, describing my day yesterday. 
[03:22:30]  Great.  Terrence Howard, I thought, I've heard that, not that he's a stiff, but he's a very serious interview.  Well, you never know with these actors, because they don't like to hang.  You know what I mean?  Dude, after the show, he's like, I can't wait to come back.  Right.  Well, he could hang.  And Roland said, look, the guy doesn't do interviews like that.  He's usually pretty, pretty mellow, pretty straightforward.  We didn't get that today, man.  No, not at all.  I hope we have the isolated audio clip of him saying, what is a shit fuck? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  That would be good.  That's what we need to farm out to the press.  True.  Did you get your tweet out?  Honestly, I was just trying to be witty, and I'm like, just fucking.  Just tweet it.  Just tweet the picture.  You can't overthink these things.  It's a picture from my vantage point.  That's kind of cool.  Just say, look, it's Terrence Howard.  I just went with an amazing time with Terrence Howard and Jim Jeffries.  That's it.  That's it.  What are you thinking about it for?  You're right.  You just write it and you send it.  It's not like somebody's going to see one of your tweets and be like, holy shit, we need 
[03:23:30]  to make this guy the next big thing.  Yeah, right.  It's a body of work, Opie.  It's a full body.  It's not just one little thing.  That's true.  Opie Radio will not suffer.  Opie Radio is a brand.  It is a brand.  Like Pepsi.  That's a brand.  Opie Radio on YouTube for the latest elevator show.  You're the blue magic of Twitter.  We got a great idea.  Thanks to Troy Kwan for an elevator show.  I don't know if he's going to do it, though.  What's the idea?  David Lee Roth in the elevator. 
[03:24:00]  There's an idea there, too.  I just think just having that dude in the elevator.  We want him to sing I'm Just a Gigolo.  Okay.  Every time the door opens.  But as soon as it closes and the person comes in, he stops singing.  And will that also be a test to see how much pride David Lee Roth has left?  Oh, man.  You got to think I could get him on the elevator show.  I bet you could.  Well, it's also going to depend on how the interview goes.  Because if he comes in a little hostile. 
[03:24:30]  Well, we've said some weird things about him over the years.  Right.  And, I mean, you attacked him, but that's when he was doing the radio show and he was kind  of competing, so that's all fair and love and war.  Well, this radio show was weird.  It wasn't focused.  It wasn't weird.  It was terrible.  We can just say what it was.  It wasn't a good show.  But he's a good talker and he's a good personality.  He's a great personality, but you know.  I don't know if I'd want to hang out with him.  He seems like he's exhausting, but do you remember.  I can't believe that didn't translate to radio.  I was an intern.  I was actually not even officially an intern.  I was back from school for Christmas and just working for free because I'm a hustler. 
[03:25:00]  It's what I do.  Who told you to hang in there?  You did.  And I take advice.  I'm like the other people around here who are just like, what?  I'm not on duty.  Do you know what you said to me when David Lee Roth's show started?  You guys were listening to it before the show just to hear what it sounded like.  And you walked towards the studio to start your show and you rolled your eyes at me and  said, you sure you still want to get into this business?  Wow.  Based on David Lee Roth's show.  I'll never forget that.  Well, it was a bust.  We all know that.  Because I thought to myself, no, but I didn't have anything else to do. 
[03:25:30]  And we were wrong about Van Halen because they're going back on tour.  I was reading about that the other day.  Well, they say they're going back on tour.  No, they got dates and everything at festivals overseas.  Troy Kwan, are we going to do the David Lee Roth elevator video?  I'm down, man.  I hope he does it.  But to be fair, you're down for...  Whatever.  Okay.  Just a recap from the video, the new elevator video.  By the way, that's up on YouTube slash OP Radio.  It's the first video.  So you go to YouTube.com slash OP Radio.  It just plays for you.  I made it nice and easy.  Just search in Elevator Show. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  And Troy Kwan's the big star of this week's episode.  Well, let's be fair.  Troy Kwan is maybe a supporting role.  There's a big star in a video.  And that's the woman who works in security who's in the corner of the elevator.  Oh, she's the same time.  Totally forgot she was in the video.  She's the star in my view.  Wait, she works in security?  Yeah.  Was she cool?  She's awesome.  I flirt with her every day.  Yeah, Sam flirts with her every day.  But the Miz hit me so hard.  There was no handprint on me.  Right.  But he hit me so hard that my tit swelled up.  Oh, God. 
[03:26:30]  I had a tit.  And you're already so sensitive about your nipples.  Yeah.  And of course, there's a lot of comments about my nipples, too.  Well, they knew.  They knew where to attack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They couldn't help talking about your body.  But, yeah.  Secretly, they want to have sex with you.  But I had a full titty.  I had probably like a beacom.  Full beacom?  Yeah.  Wow.  And that was swelling?  I was like, what the fuck happened to my tit?  Dude, wrestlers hit hard.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, that's what they do.  Yeah.  They have the ability to do it.  Just because they pull punches every now and then, or every time they throw a punch, 
[03:27:00]  doesn't mean that they can't do it.  And I think he was insulted that I asked him to hit me again.  Because he really made it hurt.  He was like, all right, I'm going to show you, motherfucker.  Well, that's the old school wrestling mentality.  That's what got John Stossel slapped in his ears.  Because, you know, you go up to a wrestler and you're like,  you kind of act like he's not as tough as he says he is.  And they've been hearing that, you know, it's phony, it's phony all their lives.  So they're like, okay, here's phony.  Boom!  Now you have a titty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, even fake wrestlers know how to fucking hit.  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  That's why that's always been so stupid.  Right.  They could, if they were in a fight with you, they would win the fight.  Okay.  So they're doing some fake wrestling shit.  We're going old school.  Because the newer guys definitely fucking hit.  They hit each other a lot more than they used to old school.  They'll throw a potato every now and then.  Is that what that's called?  When you just, yeah, when your fist is a potato and you just knock somebody with it.  Yeah.  I always thought the reporters challenging the wrestlers was so stupid.  Because I'm like, he's still a man.  He's still a big man.  And you're insulting him.  So, of course, he's going to now hit you like a man and not like a guy that does fake wrestling. 
[03:28:00]  He's 6'5", 250.  Right.  I don't care if he's faking it.  He could still kick your ass.  Right.  No matter what.  All right.  I got to go home.  And you learned that the hard way, didn't you, Troy?  Yeah.  Pushing the Miz.  He's a cool dude, though.  He is.  He's very cool.  Did you enjoy having the Miz in here?  Yeah.  I like the Miz.  Yeah.  We go way back with him.  Yeah.  And I like that Troy's the star of the latest video.  Well, again, I'm going to give it to my homegirl who works security here.  Well, Troy's also.  And that's not a black thing that I said homegirl.  It's not because she's black, but she happens to be.  Troy might get a bigger role in the show. 
[03:28:30]  In which show?  The elevator show.  Oh, okay.  I was about to say.  What?  I got a lot of ideas, man.  He's coming with ideas.  He is?  He's coming to the table?  Might give him an actual title.  What do you want?  I don't know.  Executive producer?  I got to think about it.  Of Opie's Elevator Show?  Cool.  Wouldn't you want a writer thing?  If you're coming up with ideas, that's a writer.  Head writer.  I'll give him the writing credit.  All right.  Maybe you could give him the Stangle head writer, executive producer credit.  David Lee Roth idea is really good.  And then he has another idea that's really good.  Can you tell me what it is? 
[03:29:00]  No, because I keep selling them.  Yeah, we kind of want it to be a surprise.  You gave away this week's fucking punchline.  It's a video.  It's a video.  It's a video punchline.  Nobody's watching that to see what's going to happen.  No one knew for sure that The Miz was going to fucking slap his sunburn.  It's a minute and a half long.  Are we that sensitive about spoiler alerts that we can't get through 90 seconds?  Yes.  Yes, I'm trying to build the elevator show.  Troy, did you sit there thinking, oh, I can't believe Sam gave away the ending?  Yes.  Well, I mean, it's Ovi's video.  Of course. 
[03:29:30]  However he interprets that.  Whatever boss man says, right?  You're trying to keep your new job.  I'm getting advice from Coke Logic.  Oh, good.  I'll give you a...  He's like, you've got to go the next step and get a desk in the elevator for quick sit-down interviews.  Yeah.  You've got to push it, start a little something.  I feel like there's so much you could do with that.  It's endless.  Well, of course, anything and any weird shit that happens in an elevator with unsuspecting people, that's it.  And it's so quick.  Right.  It's just, it's, you can talk anybody doing anything because it's going to be a minute long.  That's it. 
[03:30:00]  I need two stools and then interview people.  Oh, you need two stools in there.  Yeah, but the desk is the joke, like a late night talk show.  I think I'm going to have a musical guest next week.  In the elevator?  Yeah.  Was that the David Lee Roth thing?  No, mustard's going to break out a cover.  What's that, what's that one song?  Creep?  No, he's not.  That, the AOL, oh, fuck.  AOL.  It was a big hit, like two years ago.  Big Steve Case hit?  Shit, keep talking, I'll find it.  Did it start with like a welcome? 
[03:30:30]  No, you asshole.  You said AOL.  Are you excited about this, your new job, Troy?  Yeah, I got a ton of ideas.  Head writer, executive producer of the Opie Elevator.  Is that officially what it is?  I thought that's what we agreed upon.  Oh, yeah, Sale.  Sale?  Yeah, that song's Sale.  By who?  I said AOL.  I did say that, right?  America Online, keyword Sale.  I swear to God, I'm going to go home and sleep.  AOL Nation.  I don't know that song.  You know Sale by AOL Nation.  I know, come sail away.  Give me, give me Sale by AOL Nation.  Come sail away with me. 
[03:31:00]  Mustard might do this as a cover, as my musical guest in the elevator.  I think Monday.  Give it to me, E-Rock.  He's telling me I know this song.  I beg to differ.  Of course you know it.  It was a huge hit two years ago.  Oh, I know this song.  From this?  Yeah.  You know this?  I think so.  You better.  You're in the club.  It's a great song.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Now you know it?  Sale! 
[03:31:30]  Sale!  I went to a club or a bunch of bars last weekend.  I can't get away from Macklemore and Harlem Shake.  That's it.  That's all the clubs are playing.  Absolutely.  Over and over again?  Macklemore and Harlem Shake.  You know this shit, right?  Are you playing that?  Of course.  You got to, right?  Something for the ladies to dance to.  So Mustard's going to redo this?  This would be cool.  And the elevator?  Acoustic.  Yeah.  This would be really cool.  With his raspy voice?  I would do the Anthony Infections part, but I'll leave that to him.  Infections. 
[03:32:00]  Inflections.  Although they may be infections, too.  He'll do a good version of this.  This will be good.  I think so.  So it might be my first musical guest.  This will be good.  And that stupid Rich Voss.  We're still talking about the elevator show, huh?  Thank God, yeah.  You must be in paradise.  Well, Rich Voss.  I write him and go, hey, Rich, are you up for doing some stand-up in the elevator?  This is perfect for Voss.  I mean, one of the funniest things that we did on this show, before the elevator show  took off, when we still did the radio show, was the Rich Voss Starbucks comedy tour during 
[03:32:30]  the walkover.  And we did Route 57.  So I'm like, he did Pick a Bagel.  And he did some weird diner in, where the fuck were you?  I think it might have been Cleveland.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, what?  In Cleveland.  Yeah.  And, uh, so I'm thinking this is an extension of something he's already done.  And I go, hey, man, you want to do stand-up in, uh, in an elevator for my, uh, web series?  He writes, we'll think about it.  What?  And, of course, they didn't write him back.  I'm like, oh, fuck yourself.  He's big-timing you a little bit. 
[03:33:00]  Because of Troy Kwan, I got plenty of ideas.  I don't need him doing stand-up in the elevator, then.  Plus, let's be honest.  Or he had DeRosa.  Just replace him.  Ooh.  Yeah, called DeRosa.  Troy bit his tongue on that one.  Oh, sorry, Troy.  I didn't say anything, though.  Troy, you got to say in this.  You're the executive producer now.  That's true.  Executive producer, head writer.  Is DeRosa the guy?  Or should we pick, like, a young up-and-comer?  Soder?  Well, I think, I think, uh, see what our options are.  Soder?  Gotta go over the options.  Well, there's a lot.  I think there's a lot of young, hungry guys, like, uh, the dude that was on the after show yesterday. 
[03:33:30]  Chris.  Christy Stefano.  Did you hear him on the after show?  I did not.  He's awesome.  He was really fucking funny.  Really?  How do I know?  Um, he opened up for Jay Moore.  He's on MTV2's Guy Code.  He, uh, headlined Caroline's last night.  The governor.  I'll have to check him out.  Um, yeah, we could get Virgil in the elevator, I think.  Yeah, it's gonna cost you.  It's gonna cost you.  I need a, I need a, I need a, uh, a sexy, I need a sexy episode, I decided.  Something with some girls.  Yeah, but I can't figure out exactly what.  So you're gonna bring, you're gonna, you're gonna bring the girls back to the elevator show 
[03:34:00]  before you bring them back to this show.  I know what everyone's thinking.  I should probably, like, start coming up with ideas for the actual radio show.  It might not.  I mean, it's not gonna hurt anything.  Yeah.  Steven Lynch is coming back soon.  I got, I got an idea for the, uh, sexy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think you should have a girl.  You know how they get down on their, their...  This is for the radio show, or?  No, but this is for the elevator show.  Oh, okay.  It's all about the elevator show.  Right, I'm sorry.  Get with the program.  Have a girl.  You know how girls, like, get down on their, their, like, almost doggy sound, they put  their ass up in the air, and then they... 
[03:34:30]  That's a downward-facing dog.  Yeah, but, but, like, shake their ass, like, booty clap?  Head down, ass up.  Face down, ass up.  Right.  Wait, why don't we do fucking, uh, a yoga class in the elevator?  There you go.  But they, they can only do downward-facing, uh, dog.  But you're thinking about booty claps.  Like, booty clapping, and then we just sit there and make it rain on her the whole time.  So the door opens and bitch is just getting it rained on.  It's a great idea.  Troy's brought the whole, uh, uh, the, the door opening concept to the elevator show.  What's the door opening concept?  Well, you know, door opens, and you're seeing some weird shit. 
[03:35:00]  That's when the shit happens.  Right, and then the door closes, and everyone's just kind of cool again.  Now, aren't you going to need, to get the full perspective, aren't you going to need a  cameraman outside the door?  Yeah, I'm going, I'm going to go with a two-camera shoot.  You are.  And I'm working, I'm working on some lighting right now, as we speak.  Oh, you are.  And I got my, uh, really good camera finally fixed.  I'm glad you're putting some...  It's been in the shop.  Glad you're putting so much energy into the elevator show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have a vision for the future.  I am way more excited about the elevator show. 
[03:35:30]  I had no idea.  The videos only do, like, I don't know, 50,000 views.  It doesn't matter, though, does it?  We talk to way more people.  I don't care.  I don't even, like, you go home, but it's, like...  Sale!  All those videos that I make with just a camera pointed at me?  Yeah.  I don't even look at the hits.  It's way more exciting to just be able to post it.  Why is that so much more fun?  I don't know, because it's you.  You don't have any conglomerate over your head being like, well, you know, we had some ideas  and what we could do.  Shut up.  I'll just do it myself.  Plus, it's just new and different.  Yeah.  I like new and different. 
[03:36:00]  And Troy Kwan?  It's what's next, Opie.  Now that I'm bringing Troy Kwan aboard, this fucking show's endless.  Well, I don't know if you know this about Troy, but he tends to be down for...  Whatever?  And then...  Whatever.  What?  Then he disappoints?  No.  I said he's overhyped in the past.  I've never seen him disappoint.  What?  I've never seen Troy Kwan disappoint.  He's overhyped in the past.  What did I overhype?  Uh, Chicago?  Well, because I couldn't go.  Right.  You didn't make it on a plane.  Well, no.  That's your fault.  No, no, no, no, no.  The flights got canceled.  Okay.  Well, I'm just saying.  It was bad scheduling. 
[03:36:30]  Yes.  I remember that.  Roland claims that when he went out to Vegas with you, there was a lot of hype and it was  too much hype and it didn't happen and that's why.  Well, because both of us were exhausted.  Well, still.  Both of us, Roland included.  Roland couldn't even keep his eyes open.  Yeah, but Roland can't keep his eyes open through anything.  I mean, I've never seen him keep his eyes open through a normal day.  I don't think he's made it to 10 o'clock once.  No.  An AT elevator show.  He doesn't keep his eyes open through a phone call.  Let us have a good night's rest in Vegas.  Roland.  I'll show Roland a good time.  You officially have not been on the elevator show.  I'm sorry. 
[03:37:00]  I know.  You were in the background, but I didn't film you.  Well, the head mockety-mock of the show has not written him on.  That's Troy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we've got to do just a tickle me, Roland, on the elevator.  That's a quick, easy one.  Roland's had a lot of good ideas, too.  He's definitely contributed a lot of ideas.  We're brainstorming some ideas in the studio.  Now, when...  For the elevator show.  When I...  Well, I'm going to start getting A-listers in the elevator.  You watch.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  You watch.  I bet you if you have Roland bookies...  Roland could bookies in Vegas.  Terrence Howard would go in the elevator in a second.  Yeah, and I have another idea of a big guest coming up soon. 
[03:37:30]  Do ideas have to go through Troy before they get to you?  They certainly do.  Good.  Good.  Set up a system of checks and balances and filters.  Troy's my mouthpiece.  He is?  Yeah.  He's the guy to go through.  Like, nobody's going to come to you and be like, hey, can I be on the show?  You'll be like, well, Troy's the guy to handle that.  We've still got to do the E-Rock waxing.  We've decided.  E-Rock.  We've got to do a sexy video.  You excited about that?  We have to do Roland.  He stepped out for a second.  We have to do...  What, did he take a shit?  What's he doing?  And then that cast of Star Trek is coming up soon.  Oh.  We have to do Tickle Me Roland.  We're doing the Davey Lee Roth thing hopefully Monday. 
[03:38:00]  Hopefully.  I don't know if he's doing it.  If not...  You can make that happen?  Yeah, because we're going to have Florentine here.  So I think with enough people, we could coax him.  Just an idea.  He's by himself.  If you can't get Dave...  Tell him it's the hottest web series on the internet.  That's not true.  Someone out there said it.  Just a few.  Someone tweet that right now so I can retweet it to prove that it's the hottest fucking web series.  He's living in Tokyo right now, Davey Lee Roth.  And he has a radio show in Tokyo.  Really?  Yeah.  So, but his videos are international.  That's right.  If you can't get David Lee Roth, what if we get Eastside Dave up here to do Davey Lee Roth? 
[03:38:30]  Davey Lee Roth could work.  If not David Lee Roth, Davey Lee Roth.  But then the video will shut us down.  I saw his dumb video, and I use the word dumb in a loving way.  I really do.  Some people still haven't figured that out.  Yeah.  I'm working on that myself.  He does an elevator video.  It's pretty fucking funny.  Is he as good as yours, though?  The bad elevator operator fucking video he did?  Eastside Dave has a theme where it's just like he takes something and it's the worst blank. 
[03:39:00]  But it's funny.  It's so stupid, but it's funny.  He's the worst wedding guest.  The worst elevator operator.  I think it's called Worst Elevator Operator.  I don't know.  It's Eastside Dave videos, I think.  Yeah, Eastside Dave videos.  On YouTube.  You'll find it yourself.  EastsideDaveCountry.com.  Can we just book people just for the elevator show?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  I mean, I would have said that's not a great idea, but I mean, it's Opie.  Yeah.  So I would say yes.  Yes.  I mean, there's still a ton of stuff.  There is a radio show.  Can we film one right now? 
[03:39:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean, there's nothing going on here.  Why don't you guys go for an elevator show?  Perfect.  Do the rest of the show on the elevator.  Well, I'll probably just do it here.  Why?  That's stupid.  Well, I don't want to step on your territory.  I don't want to fuck with your shit.  You know how creative you could be in a small fucking space?  That's what I'm proving here.  Almost as creative as you could be in a larger space?  I know, but...  Wait, by the way.  It's been done.  By the way.  It's been done a bunch of times by a lot of different people.  What's that quote that you just said?  You know how creative you can be in a smaller space?  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Do you realize that Steve Blatter, Gary, and Rob have just isolated that every time you  ask for a bigger studio?  All they have to do is say, Opie.  But that's why I do it.  So then I come in here and this feels like a gymnasium.  Look at all...  Holy fuck.  Imagine the possibilities in here.  Oh my god.  This is just amazing what we can do with this space.  Plus the door doesn't open every four seconds.  Amazing.  It's fucking psychology.  I guess if I could book a weather guy to give weather reports every time the door's  open.  Oh.  Rob Bartlett. 
[03:40:30]  He's a performer.  He's a brilliant stand-up comic.  Yeah, he's a Broadway star.  And works on Don Imus' radio show.  Broadcaster.  Broadcaster extraordinaire.  He just wrote me.  Yeah.  How's the family?  Healthy again, I hope.  Well, no.  Not yet, Rob.  But we're getting there.  I'd like to read my text on the air so I don't have to write them back.  You should still write them back.  I don't want it today.  Jesus Christ.  Kids being sick sucks balls because he's the father himself.  And you have meatballs. 
[03:41:00]  Stop it.  And then he writes, and he's not listening right now, out of nowhere, he writes, BTW by  the way.  I always wondered.  Elevator show is?  What's that word right there?  Shit.  Why would he text you that?  Why would he write that?  I could count on you.  What?  The elevator show.  He doesn't like the elevator show.  Shit.  Genius.  Oh.  Genius.  I guess I read that wrong.  I'll just sit back and wait for the Stengel brothers to write me. 
[03:41:30]  I know a thing or two about being creative.  Did you hear what Daryl Hammond said about me yesterday while you guys were tearing me  down?  What?  Brilliant.  He said, don't worry about that.  You're brilliant.  Because you found a video for him?  That's right.  All right.  That's right.  I think we overused that word myself.  Brilliant?  Well, I think genius is overused, personally.  True, but in this case, it's...  That's the real problem, right?  The overuse takes away from the real use.  Exactly. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God, you're smart, Sam Roberts.  I was just thinking that.  You're not a genius, but you're smart.  Oh, man.  Brilliant?  No, no.  Oh.  No, no, no.  No, far from that.  Not even close.  All right.  Anyone around to film an elevator show?  I'm under pressure.  He texted me, Opie, when I came in here.  I got five days left.  When I came in here on Sunday to do my show, he was like, anybody around there to do an  elevator video?  I'm like, it's Sunday.  Nobody's here.  Well, because I got to do them on the fly now.  You got two in the chamber for next week.  I don't know.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  Diamond Dave will work out. 
[03:42:30]  One of the two will work out.  Diamond Dave.  Him doing that would be...  He's the fucking man.  I saw Ben Halen last summer.  They sounded so good.  Really?  Yeah.  They sound the same at Cafe Wall.  We'll see if he's the man.  Yeah.  We'll find out on Monday.  Is Terrence Howard going toward the elevator?  Yeah.  You better go grab him.  I got to hang out near the elevator now.  Hey, T. Howard.  Yo, Howard.  T.  Yo, T.  His last interview is like 11.  T.H.  Huh?  His last interview is at 11.  Right.  No idea what he said.  Who?  Diamond Dave?  No. 
[03:43:00]  Terrence Howard's last interview is 11.  Oh, okay.  So he'll be free at 11.25 or so.  All right.  What else is going on?  Nothing, man.  All right.  Good.  Then you take over.  All right.  Oh.  You were already taking over?  This was already my show.  You were a guest at my house.  Oh, wow.  Never forget that.  Wow.  I didn't even notice.  Yeah.  So would that make you feel comfortable?  That's pretty smooth.  I put you at ease.  That was pretty smooth.  I got you to admit that you care far more about the elevator show than the radio show.  I think everyone knows that, though.  Yeah, that is obvious.  Takes the littlest thing to make me...  Excited? 
[03:43:30]  Excited.  Ooh, new, shiny.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll be bored with the elevator show within weeks.  But then somebody will give attention to some other new thing and you'll go, yes!  Of course, of course.  Did you see Maria Menounos go to your elevator show?  I think it's Menounos.  What can I ask her in the elevator?  Just be like, hey, I know you knew who I was from my show.  Would you suck it?  Something like that.  Just something real, literal, and easy.  Troy, what do you think?  I mean, throw it out there.  See what she says.  You're writing all these down? 
[03:44:00]  He's got a...  Right here.  A Mary Lou Henner memory.  Until Friday.  All right, let's push the elevator show to the wrestling people.  Right.  Because the star is one of their own.  Well, am I...  You got those connections.  I don't.  Well, I'm not employed by the elevator show.  Yeah, but you're like...  You, uh...  Contributing editor?  Yeah, you kind of want to still work for the opening of the show, so I would probably  do that.  I probably would do that.  All right, yeah, let's make sure that video gets out there.  Yeah, I'm going to make sure they see that video.  You're right.  Son of a bitch.  You're right.  I think Sam has a lot to contribute to the elevator show. 
[03:44:30]  Sam's a funny motherfucker.  He kind of came up with the last one.  Which one?  The Miz thing?  Yeah.  That was Troy's idea.  Troy Kwan's idea.  Yeah.  He's been taking credit for it for the last two days.  God damn it.  No, I haven't been taking...  Can I tell you something, Troy?  I haven't mentioned the elevator show once in the last two days.  I'm not taking credit for anything.  I think he was taking credit.  You know what's not on the forefront of my mind?  Elevator?  The elevator show.  That's your mind.  Oh, that's your problem. 
[03:45:00]  That's true.  I mean, I'm the one who's behind on the time zone.  Yes, you are.  I got to realize something.  And then you had a cameo in the Half a Hulk face elevator show.  That's right.  Can we do a lobby video, you and I?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Did you see that?  What just happened?  I didn't answer that.  Son of a bitch.  I'm stuck on generation now, whereas you guys are generation next.  You know what I mean?  And I need to realize that you guys are the bandwagon to get on. 
[03:45:30]  Not this.  The next level shit.  Right.  Is that good what he said?  Yeah, it's great what he says.  Right?  We're ahead of the game.  Right.  We're ahead of the curve.  Yes.  Go talk about sharks.  There's a lot of them in the water.  I saw that picture.  But even more importantly, you know, there's a lot of blades on your razor.  You don't need them.  You don't need them, Opie.  You got a beard and everything.  There's no...  I hate the copy.  Huh?  I hate the copy, but I love the product.  You know why I hate the copy?  Why?  Because I don't get to say anymore, is that in pesos?  Oh, they took that line out.  Yeah, that was my favorite line. 
[03:46:00]  It was becoming a catchphrase of mine.  I enjoy when you say zombied out, though.  Well, that's what happens.  You end up with these blades that zombie out your face because they're old.  Because you ran out of blades.  And you forgot to replace them.  Or you can't afford it.  So what are you going to do?  This, ladies and gentlemen, is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  Dollar Shave Club is for guys who routinely forget to buy or simply hate shelling out for blades.  So here's what all the Dollar Shave Club buzz is about. 
[03:46:30]  Everyone buys razor blades, right?  Right?  Yes, of course you do.  Well, brand name razor companies, they nail you.  They build them up with 10 blades, a vibrating handle, as if you needed that.  What, a back scratcher?  No!  You end up paying up the wazoo for all this shit.  I told you that's what they leave the world.  Dollar Shave...  I can hear what you're saying.  Dollar Shave Club says stop overpaying for shave technology you don't need.  With Dollar Shave Club, you send them a couple bucks a month, and they deliver great quality razor blades right to your door.

Join all the after Opie and Anthony Live listeners who have already found the smarter way to shave and save at DollarShaveClub.com.  DollarShaveClub.com.  That's DollarShaveClub.com.  And I got a tweet yesterday from somebody asking me, hey, is there a coupon code for this place?  It's called Dollar Shave Club.  How much of a coupon do you need?  You don't have a couple bucks?  That's the whole point. 
[03:47:30]  DollarShaveClub.com.  Check them out right now.  And tell them Sam Roberts sent you.  Roland, you ready for your big show this weekend?  I am.  You are?  Yeah, the Cuban is researched, and he's pumped up for the show.  Is Eric in there?  Yep.  How come Opie and Anthony had this star-studded end of their show, and I'm left with nothing?  Nothing!  Well, I tried to get the guest for you.  Why wouldn't Maria Menounos want to come in and say hi to me?  Because they're running behind, and she just started doing her last interview, so it wasn't going to be done before you are. 
[03:48:00]  I'll watch that runner have her run that behind, whatever that means.  You know she's a wrestling fan?  We would have had so much to talk about.  Yeah, she's a diehard...  She was in WrestleMania.  She wrestled at WrestleMania.  And...  She's a diehard Pats fan.  She's a hot chick.  You know how much we could have talked about?  We could have been a little bit like, oh, so what wrestlers do you like?  Oh, so what it's like being a hot chick?  You know what I mean?  Like, how easy do you give it up?  And all these questions.  I had all this stuff in the barrel. 
[03:48:30]  E-Rock, you've got to be on the ball.  How come she wasn't on the list of people coming up today?  I don't know.  I had no idea she was even going to be here.  She was, right?  Yeah, because you never know when she's in New York or L.A. for the extra.  I'm rolling.  I need you to tell Spencer something.  Okay, tell him...  Remind him we took that Reno 911 chick.  Okay, she was a wonderful guest, okay?  Great interview.  But let's be honest.  That wasn't one I was clamoring for, you know what I mean?  I know.  That was a late night email that I was like, I got you, buddy.  Me and you, Spencer.  Remind him, next time Maria Menounos comes up, it's all about the after show right now. 
[03:49:00]  She's coming back.  Up front, it's just a few weeks away.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You think she'll do the after show?  Yeah.  Or at least the Sunday show, something.  She'll probably do the O&A show, then ask her to stay after.  Yeah, yeah.  The Sunday show this week has Matthew Fox from Lost, which is big, and I think Mary Lou  Henner from Celebrity Apprentice, both on the Sunday show.  Are you going to have the other person too, or...?  No.  Not this week.  Okay.  We've got to spread them out, Roland.  We've got to spread them out.  That's something you don't learn.  Roland is all about having guests, but he likes having one hour and just chock full of guests. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  They're all coming to hang out.  So you've got like four or five chefs coming in.  Four chefs are all coming at the same time to hang out.  Now, the Roland Food Court show goes down Saturday, tomorrow, 5 p.m. Eastern, correct?  Do you need me for this one?  Yes.  If you can't...  I got your back, buddy.  You know I got your back.  It'll also be on demand too, right?  Yeah.  We'll put it up on demand, but listen live, because that's an experience that, you know,  bring your friends and family.  You can call in.  And if you have any questions, we have Chef Michael Simon. 
[03:50:00]  What if the question is, what the fuck did you just say, Roland?  I'll just go, fuck you, next call.  You will.  And you did it last week.  Yeah.  And Eric, are you really sitting here and telling me that Roland is going to have to  go into an hour of pre-recorded random shit?  You're not going to do your show?  Not this time, no.  Why?  Because I'm not ready to do it yet.  What's ready?  It's an hour.  He's never going to be ready.  There's no such thing as ready.  Do I ever seem ready for this show?  I do it every day.  You fly by the seat of your pants if you have to. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  If I have to, I do it every day.  I'm always flying by the seat of my pants.  The elevator show just happens.  Right.  It's magic.  It just happens, Roland.  You've seen it happen before.  Iraq, how much prep do Opie and Anthony walk into a show with?  From themselves, not much.  Have you ever seen Opie and Anthony ready at 6 a.m. to do a four-hour show?  I guess.  No, you haven't.  Have you, Troy?  No.  Roland?  No.  When have they been ready to do a four-hour show?  Well, they do it. 
[03:51:00]  So why can't you?  That's the point.  It's one hour.  It's 52 minutes.  Then you do it, Troy.  I'm not the one that wanted to tell everybody that I need a podcast.  They're like, okay, you have your own show.  Honestly, and Troy, I hope you take no offense to this.  There's no listener demand for a Troy show.  No.  Listeners don't want to.  You know what?  I pitched this to people.  And I said, do you guys want a Troy show?  And you know what they said?  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Yeah.  They didn't want it.  Everybody wants to hear E-Rock.  What does E-Rock have to say?  Right.  What's on the mind of the sex man?  Yeah.  Because he's got a unique perspective.  Nobody wants to hear from a guy who, like, can get girls, who goes to cool places. 
[03:51:30]  Like, nobody wants to hear from somebody who's cooler than them.  You know what I mean?  Right.  People want to hear from somebody who's like, that's a guy I can relate to.  Yeah.  In the trenches.  Right.  That's why I've been able to do this.  A man's man.  Right.  Or a loser.  They want to hear from a loser.  You know what I mean?  He's like Don Julio.  I don't.  Who's Don Julio?  Or is it the guy?  The horn Julio?  The most interesting man in the world? 
[03:52:00]  Well, yeah.  No.  I don't think that's what we're saying at all, actually.  That's the complete opposite of what I was saying.  My bad.  I'm too excited.  They don't want a guy who's, like, sitting there being like, oh, man.  I'm not a good looking dude.  I can't get girls.  I don't want to hear about a guy who can.  I want to hear from a guy who fucking sits at home and plays Lego toys and watches The  Simpsons and Animaniacs.  And he has a new TV.  Eric, you have a new TV?  Yes, I do. 
[03:52:30]  How big is that TV?  That is 60.  What the fuck?  They make 60 inch TVs, Troy?  Apparently.  I had no idea.  Well, they make 65 like Opie's.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  Hopefully they still make them because Opie needs a replacement.  How many TVs are there in your house now?  That would be six.  Jesus Christ.  Six televisions.  Let me get one.  Yeah, you can take it.  He's like a Dave & Buster's.  Can I have one?  We got a 19 inch you can take.  19 inch?  Eric, I need to do better than that.  We need to upgrade the Nageltron. 
[03:53:00]  You feel me?  No, you left the Nageltron when you moved.  Because it was a giant 100 pound tube TV.  Yeah, I know.  Now tell me this, Eric.  Eric, are we ready for tomorrow night?  Bageling with the Sex, episode two, starring Eric Nagel.  Not tomorrow, no.  Why not?  Why?  I'm not going to do it tomorrow.  Okay, here's, you want me to run down your show for you?  I'll do it.  You want me to prep your show?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  We spend ten minutes talking about the wrestling episode of The Simpsons. 
[03:53:30]  Take calls on that.  Okay?  So that's ten.  You spend 15 minutes booking your own fantasy WrestleMania.  25 minutes right there.  You spend another 15 minutes talking about your favorite, no, 20 minutes talking about  your favorite cartoon from when you were a kid.  That's the easiest, simplest, and they'll want to hear it from you.  Call in your favorite cartoon from when you were a kid.  I like Denver, the last dinosaur.  You know, taking calls about that.  You're up to 45 minutes now, and from 45 to 52, Transformers or GoBots, what is the 
[03:54:00]  supreme robot?  And also airs Netflix pics.  I just gave you 52 minutes, Eric.  Would you co-host it with him if he did it?  Yeah.  Did you hear that?  I heard it.  But he doesn't want me co-hosting.  Why?  Do you want me co-hosting, Eric?  You want me to do this for you?  No.  Why not?  Because you got your own thing.  I got my own thing.  Yeah, but obviously he doesn't think he can carry the weight of it.  Eric, will you do that show?  I just formatted it for you.  I understand, but I'm not doing it tomorrow. 
[03:54:30]  How much prep do you need?  I say the bageling with the sex show still happens.  And then what do we do?  I mean, we just recap all the funny stories that we've ever heard about Eric.  We take calls.  People can give their comment on him.  Eric, it's like either show up and do the show, or don't show up.  Or talk about me for an hour.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but it's not going to be the most flattering.  Yeah, don't think it's...  So it's five days a week, so what's the difference?  Well, good point. 
[03:55:00]  Well, I mean, you know what's worse than five days a week?  Six.  Six days a week.  When it's invading your weekend life.  That's worse.  Like, can you imagine if we just went through every photo about Eric?  Well, I mean, we'd only have an hour.  Right, but we'd get through a lot.  Every photo.  Like, the worst Eric moments on the air.  I mean, there's a lot to do.  Yeah, but I don't want to have to put in work into a show that Eric's not even going to be a part of.  Oh, he'd be a part of it.  He'd be there, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's there in spirit.  He'd be a topic of conversation. 
[03:55:30]  Roland, are you ready for yours?  Yeah.  You are?  Yeah.  The chefs are going to bring some food.  They are bringing food.  They're bringing food, booze.  Now we're talking.  And the vegan chef is going to bring some special drinks.  Vegan chef?  Yeah, she's super hot.  I like that.  I like when these people bring food.  They're all going to bring food, drinks.  Jess was wondering about going, but then she described the people who work here as scavengers.  She goes, was there going to be food there?  I'm going, yeah, there's going to be all kinds of chefs. 
[03:56:00]  And she's like, yeah, but whenever anybody brings food there, everybody turns into scavengers.  You can't get any.  It's true.  No, but I'm so happy that there's something going on up here where we can actually eat.  But she's a lady.  Well, she got first served.  Let's go to Richard in Virginia.  Richard.  What's going on, man?  You got a show in for the Batman 90s cartoons.  You like Batman the Animated Series.  Oh, hell yeah.  The Dark Horse series.  Those things were awesome, man.  Eric, what do you think?  I've actually never watched them. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, really?  Why not?  I wasn't into Batman at that time.  Here's a show, Eric.  There's a show right here.  What about Toon Time with Eric Nagel?  Oh, yeah.  What if you did a show about cartoons tomorrow night?  You always talk about it.  What if we did Toon Time with Eric Nagel?  That is such an easy show.  You don't have to prep because you already have all the information.  It's literally you just take calls for 52 minutes about cartoons that people like.  And nobody's going to make fun of you because they never do.  Every time you do one of these projects, you're always like, oh, everybody's going to make fun of me. 
[03:57:00]  And then they never make fun of you.  Do they?  It always ends up pretty good because you know what you're doing.  You've been in radio for years.  You know what you're doing here.  How long have you said you've been in radio?  Since I was 16.  That's over 20 years.  Imagine Eric actually doing like a...  I'm not over...  No, it's not.  Oh.  Imagine doing like a music show.  Yeah, I mean, I think Toon Time with Eric Nagel is the show.  Maybe Bagel and What the Sex didn't work.  And maybe it needs a little more prep. 
[03:57:30]  Toon Time with Eric Nagel.  Eric, tomorrow night at 6 p.m. Eastern, Toon Time with Eric Nagel.  No.  Why not?  You're driving me insane.  I just want to hear you do a good show.  I understand that, but not this time around.  Why?  Just tell me why.  Give me your...  Because I don't want to do it.  Why?  Because I don't want to.  Don't give me a seven-year-old answer.  Give me like a real adult like...  It's the same answer I gave you when you started this weeks ago.  What?  I just don't want to do it right now.  But why not?  Why do you not want to do it?  Because I don't want to.  You're going to have fun if you do it.  You can't be afraid of success, Eric. 
[03:58:00]  Do not fear success.  Because you know what happens if you're afraid of success?  Failure.  And that's who you should be afraid of.  Failing.  Mike, you're on the show.  Yo, Eric.  This is Mike in Virginia.  I'm going to listen tomorrow because I want to know what happened to James Bond Jr.  in the 90s.  You remember that theme song, Eric?  James Bond.  James Bond Jr.  James Bond.  Remember that?  I remember the show, yeah.  Okay.  The fact that you remember James Bond Jr. means you should be doing a show called Toon Time. 
[03:58:30]  It didn't last long.  But you remember it.  Tyler in Texas.  Love you.  Love the show.  Johnny Bravo was by far the best cartoon ever.  Johnny Bravo, Eric.  Johnny Bravo, Cartoon Network.  Very good show.  Toon Time with Eric Nagel.  Why not?  You're killing me.  You can't be afraid to succeed.  And his whole name, too.  It's a great name.  It's not even a shitty name.  Toon Time with Eric Nagel.  Roland will give you some copies of Roger Rabbit to give away.  It'll be great. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  What do you think, Eric?  Please.  We have to go.  We're out of time.  You fucking pussy.  Can I mention something real quick?  Yeah.  March 23rd, I'm in Redding, Pennsylvania at Building 24 with White Noise, two of the guys  from the Bloodhound Gang.  So come out.  Maybe Eric will do a surprise Toon Time show tomorrow, but he is really pussying out right  now.  5 p.m. Eastern is going to be the food court.  Sunday afternoon at 4 is my show.  It always is.  It's not a special thing.  So if you don't usually listen, don't listen thinking it's a big deal.  And that's it.  Roland, good luck tomorrow.  I'll see you.  Thank you.  And Toon Time. 
[03:59:30]  Toon Time with Eric Nagel is, I don't know.  It's genius.  Make it happen.  It should happen.  And see you this weekend.  Goodbye, everybody. </pre>
