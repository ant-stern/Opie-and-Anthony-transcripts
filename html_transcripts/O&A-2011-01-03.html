<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts returning from their holiday break, joking about their alarms before diving into a scathing critique of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast.  They relentlessly mocked Clark's slurred speech and apparent cognitive decline,  playing and dissecting numerous clips to highlight his mumbling and what they perceived as pre-recorded segments.  Kathy Griffin's New Year's Eve appearance also drew their ire.  Their commentary was heavily laced with profanity and focused on Clark's age and failing health, questioning the show's continued airing purely for ratings.  The Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block's appearances, and their own aging, were also commented on.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a recent New York City snowstorm, followed by one host's recounting of his Las Vegas trip. This included meetings with UFC president Dana White (at his office and gym), and attending a Penn & Teller magic show.  He also shared a humiliating anecdote about a virtual reality rollercoaster experience.

The next major topic was leaked photos and videos of Rex Ryan's wife, with the hosts reacting with amusement and providing graphic commentary about the explicit content.  Speculation about the nature of the relationship followed.

Shifting gears, the broadcast heavily focused on NFL controversies.  Brett Favre's retirement (and potential return), the Seattle Seahawks' unusual playoff seeding (7-9 record), and the New York Jets' season were dissected.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to the Jen Sterger/Brett Favre scandal, featuring graphic descriptions and crude humor regarding the explicit photos Favre sent.  The hosts offered commentary on Sterger's public image and Favre's actions, alongside extensive speculation.

The show also covered a news story about a Marine couple assaulted at a movie theater, focusing on what they perceived as media bias in its reporting.  Rick from Florida, a caller, claimed to have witnessed the incident, corroborating details.  Other pop culture topics, including a Hyundai commercial, "The Stand" TV series, and the movie "True Grit," were briefly touched upon.  No guests were explicitly mentioned in studio during the NFL-centric portion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Merry New Year!  Merry New Year!  Ah, yes.  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody doing?  We're all back to work.  I like the new opening.  You like it?  I certainly do.  Oh, that was new?  Yes.  You didn't notice?  The Aussie Oddborn edition.  I just hear enough of this palaver, and I know it's time to go.  It's like, palaver loves dog.  Get it?  First bomb of the new year.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:00:30]  Pavlov's dog.  Wow, and not a second too soon.  All right, 2011.  Ready to go.  Off to a great start.  First bomb has been dropped.  Oh, boy, has it.  That fucking alarm.  Holy shit.  Did you want to just throw it out the window today?  Yeah.  Actually, it was Kenny calling me, so yes.  I'll have to wake you up.  Throw him out the window.  That would be nice.  I was up an hour early. 
[00:01:00]  I couldn't sleep by sight.  You couldn't wait to get here?  I really can't.  Remember, the break felt too long.  I really did want to just get back to work.  I get really antsy after a while.  Oh, my God.  Anty.  Nah, it was one of those, yeah, Kenny gives the old call, and I have three alarms that  go up after Kenny, but I didn't even need them because I kept just looking at the  clock and going, just kidding.  Time to get the fuck up.  Yeah.  What's five more minutes going to do?  You've been on vacation, dummy.  The phone's lit already.  Happy New Year.  Well, Happy New Year to you, too, my friends.  Happy New Year. 
[00:01:30]  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Dick Clark did well, though, because he pre-recorded his countdown.  That seems to be the word, the rumor, if you will.  Yeah, because they never showed him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it wasn't like in previous years where they showed him, and he's, 10, 7, 8, 9, 3,  2, 5, 8.  It was definitely pre-recorded.  Absolutely.  At this point, ABC, enough police. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Dick Clark's just bumming everyone out.  It's not even Dick Clark anymore.  No, let him just retire.  Watch any of the old clips of the New Year's Rockin' Eve, and that guy, it was a different guy.  Right.  If I have to hear Ryan Seacrest say one more time, you got that right, Dick.  Because he doesn't know what Dick Clark's saying, so he figures if he says, you got that right, Dick,  it'll make sense.  It's safe.  Ah, yeah, Dick.  Hey, and let's now go back up to the booth with Dick Clark. 
[00:02:30]  Dick, how you doing?  And you're like, what?  What is he saying?  Well, actually, we got the audio.  Oh, he keeps saying, you're right, Dick, because nothing on the left side is any good.  You're right, Dick.  If that wasn't so mean, it would have been the second bomb of the year.  That was mean.  It was good. 
[00:03:00]  Mean equals good.  And I say poor Dick Clark, because at this point, ABC is just using him, because Dick Clark  doesn't need the money.  They know.  They know that people are tuning in.  I was actually watching Carson Daly.  I just told you guys this.  He was doing a really good job with the whole New Year's Eve thing.  And then it just hits your brain.  Oh, wait.  You got to watch Dick Clark, because he's a fucking train wreck.  That's the only reason people are watching.  And watch the dick.  Although I took a peek at Kathy Griffin, because she's so outrageous, you don't know what she's  going to do or say.  Hey, look out at that.  She's crazy. 
[00:03:30]  I was scared watching her and Anderson Cooper, because I didn't know if she was going to  curse or not.  Oh, my God.  Every year, there's some kind of controversy that happens.  Well, this year, they kept holding up a sign, do not curse.  See, because if Kathy Griffin cursed again, they were going to yank her off CNN.  So you had to watch to see if that was going to happen.  Oh, boy.  You never know.  She's quite the card.  Oh, God.  She's quite the caution.  She's got some talent, but that fake fucking shock jock shit that she does, enough already.  You're not that edgy. 
[00:04:00]  Relax.  You're on CNN.  Enough.  Anyway, here's Dick Clark.  Now I'm honored once again to be working with one of my heroes, DeBroad.  He's not honored.  Honored every year.  And he's not a hero of yours.  No.  No.  He's not.  You got the gig because he fucking had a stroke.  Exactly.  And that's that.  But that's why he makes $100 million a year.  He knows how to play the fucking game.  Yeah.  His heroes are John Travolta, Tom Cruise, and some Buzz Rock Hudson at one point. 
[00:04:30]  Anyone else that fakes it?  Anderson Cooper.  Yeah.  State of Massachusetts.  Iowa.  Yes.  Yes.  All of Chelsea.  We should keep going here.  Oh, fuck.  But that's why he makes all the money.  Yeah.  Because he can play the game.  Certainly can.  None of us would be able to play the game.  We would be shocked.  Oh, boy.  Here's old Mumble's fucking mouth.  Here comes a shell of his former existence. 
[00:05:00]  Exactly.  Now, I'm honored once again to be working with one of my heroes, the broadcasting legend who's hosted this television event for the last four decades.  Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dick Clark.  Hi, Geron.  I'm real happy to be back with you again.  And what a wonderful way to be in the new year.  One minute people are here tonight and have been in, are looking in around the world. 
[00:05:30]  Don't you dare go away.  See, that's what is happening.  That's ABC.  Due year.  Yeah.  It's, again, another due year.  And I like playing this, you know, when we get back to the radio every year because most people have a little buzz on so they don't realize how bad it actually is.  That's true.  So you got to hear it with fresh ears and no alcohol in your system.  Because everyone's sounding a bit like Dick Clark at that hour. 
[00:06:00]  And to hear it now completely sober, that's sad.  And, you know, Ryan Seacrest at this point just wants the whole fucking show to himself.  Yeah, he actually called him Ron pretty much.  Thank you, Ron.  Thank you, Ron.  You can't even say Ryan.  Thank you, Ron.  And then he's got to give the stat.  There's a million people, a billion people on TV.  There's a 22nd crowd since 19, 20.  What?  What?  Well, listen to this.  Here is the chairman of the board, Dick Clark. 
[00:06:30]  Hi, Geron.  Ben, we're about to be entertained by nine very talented young men.  I'm proud to say.  What did he say there?  I don't even know.  Nine belly tam and tamented men.  Oh, okay.  That's what I thought you were saying.  Nine belly tamented.  Talented young men.  Wait, I want to.  Nine belly tamented young men.  Was he really trying to say nine very talented young men?  I think he was.  Yeah.  Entertained by nine very talented young men. 
[00:07:00]  First of all, they're not young men anymore.  Maybe to Dick Clark.  Oh, to Dick Clark.  He's the world's oldest teenager.  He's introducing the Backstreet Boys.  Are you kidding me?  And new kids on the block who are now touring together.  And man, I know we have a few years on those guys.  They look like shit.  Anytime you have kids, boys in the name of your little combo, your little band, maybe it's time to change.  Yeah, they look horrible. 
[00:07:30]  We're about to be entertained by nine very talented young men.  I'm proud to say I was able to give a hand at the start of their career.  And boy, oh boy, did they ever roll for her.  Right?  Wow.  You're all right with this ABC, huh?  Yeah, this is.  You're okay with this.  This is what you want.  You're all right with this, right?  Why don't you at least admit you're doing it for fucking ratings? 
[00:08:00]  Just put them in a glass box with a heater on there and let them wave to the crowd.  That's why I get so frustrated.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  Yeah.  You know what we are.  That's right.  Terrible.  There you go.  Degenerates.  But fucking ABC, they're making believe this is like quality programming.  But this is a freak show like every other TV show is doing these days.  But they make believe it means something.  And it's never acknowledged.  Never acknowledged.  It's never acknowledged.  It's put on as if it's just. 
[00:08:30]  All the shows that we talk about.  Hoarders.  And all of them.  They're all freak shows.  And now New Year's Rock and Eve.  It's P.T. Barnum shit.  Sideshow shit.  Has become a freak show.  Of course it has.  You're all right with this ABC, huh?  The chairman of the board.  Let's go back up to Dick Clark.  They should go all in and just have stroke shows.  Oh, where everybody doing any announcing.  Everything. 
[00:09:00]  It's just.  Oh, Christ.  More Dick Clark.  Once again, we're back live in New York.  How there are about one minute people down there.  Right.  A minute of them.  There's one minute people down there.  What's a one minute people?  One minute people.  He's got to fucking throw the stat out every two seconds.  We know how many people are there every fucking year.  Yeah, but I mean, the gig itself is the same horseshit year after year.  It really is.  Yeah.  I mean, what could you say differently from year to year? 
[00:09:30]  Just the band.  Except that the year is a little different.  The year is different and the bands.  And the bands are a little different.  I don't think Three Dog Night is performing.  Ah, good point.  Once again, we're back live in New York.  Now, there are about one minute people down there.  Many of them got here around three o'clock this afternoon.  There's literally a ton of confetti dropping on them at 12 o'clock.  And they are going to enjoy every minute of it.  Jenny, who have you got down there? 
[00:10:00]  Thanks, Dick.  And they all just like, Teddy?  Thanks, Dick.  Teddy?  Who was he talking to?  I don't know.  Who's the girl?  That was Jenny McCarthy.  Oh, Jenny.  Did he say Jenny?  That sounded like Teddy.  That was Jenny McCarthy, who...  Yeah.  She's still pretty hot, but she's lost her whole comedy edge.  She's not funny anymore.  There's nothing going on there.  Nothing whatsoever.  I never thought she was particularly funny, honestly.  I never thought she was funny with making faces and fucking being the hot girl that picks  her nose and shit.  She had her time. 
[00:10:30]  That's pretty much what she was doing.  Being the funny lady.  I never thought she was funny.  She wasn't one of my favorites, but...  Not funny.  She still looks good.  And here's what everyone's waiting for.  Dick Clark's countdown.  Ah.  Oh, no.  It's not that bad, because a lot of people are thinking he pre-recorded this.  They never showed him.  They didn't show his face during the countdown.  But at the end, they showed him for a split second, and then ABC realized, oh, shit, and  they went off him.  Oh, no.  But what you got to see for a split second was him doubled over, like, trying to cough 
[00:11:00]  up phlegm or something.  Oh, no.  Maybe push out another tumor.  Whatever the fuck.  Another clot.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He was all just old man-y.  Oh.  You didn't see it?  That's sad.  No, I didn't see that, but I heard the countdown and everything.  It was on at my house, but I was busy.  Now, the moments we've all been waiting for, and it's coming right up.  You're going to hear a roar of the crowd, and believe me, you will never, ever forget 
[00:11:30]  it.  Are you ready?  Count it down.  Ready?  Okay, here we go now.  24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[00:12:00]  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  So, he did much better this year.  Yeah.  He was running out of air at one point, though.  Yeah, that might have been live, because it sounded like he was running out of air, which  would make sense of the shot they showed on TV.  Yeah, yeah.  Where he was like, uh, uh, uh.  He was gasping for air.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  The guy had a great career.  To see him like this on TV, year after year, it's just ridiculous.  I'll tell you why they can't let him go.  Because if they did before he wanted to, they would seem so horrible. 
[00:12:30]  The back, they would, they were afraid there'd be backlash, like, that they were so heartless  that they let this guy go because he was sick.  But what, disabled people can't do their job?  He was doing it.  We loved it, Clark.  That's true.  But it's gone way past this being disabled.  But that's what they're afraid of.  This is ridiculous.  I think most people would be relieved at this point.  Yeah, it's time to just retire.  Because you watch this.  New Year's is supposed to be a nice, fun time.  You're partying a little bit.  And he's just on TV bumming you out.  You don't want to be bummed out. 
[00:13:00]  He's bumming you out.  You know, it's supposed to be a time to make a new thing.  And he's just reminding you of your own fucking mortality.  Exactly.  And the awful things that could happen to you.  Hey, man, you're just bumming me out.  You're bumming me out.  I want to look at baby New Year.  Right.  All fresh and new.  Yeah, exactly.  I want to look at fucking the old guy fucking falling down.  Happy New Year.  See, he said it correctly.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year. 
[00:13:30]  And then I think...  Stand there with a cattle prod on him.  Get it right this time, dummy.  It's almost over.  Dick...  Dick.  A couple more dick clips here.  And just look at that crowd.  They came to have fun.  And man, are they doing it.  Every year, we find out that many of them travel from all over the world.  No matter where you live, New York is where you want to be tonight, Ryan. 
[00:14:00]  You got it, my man.  This indeed is the place to be.  You got it, my man.  He's hateable, Ryan Seacrest.  Yeah, yeah.  He really is.  Who enjoys him?  You got it, my man.  You got it, my man.  At least he's got his energy.  You know.  He's not untalented, but who likes...  He's just...  Everybody likes him.  America likes his fucking guy.  But do they really like him, or is he just the guy that's there?  He's the guy that's there.  No.  He's the guy that's there.  Then they would have got rid of him and got the other guy that's there.  No, but he's the best guy that's there for the gig. 
[00:14:30]  Because he's so willing to be like, you got it, dick.  He's obviously out of our demo, but it seems like there's a huge demo out there.  The American Idol thing.  That's fucking Ryan Seacrest.  All that shit.  He's got a hit morning show in L.A.  He's producing fucking TV shows.  He does the rockin' New Year's Eve.  American Idol.  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  Whatever.  I just read the greatest excuse I've ever read.  Oh, I know exactly what it is. 
[00:15:00]  Does it have to do with an airplane?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a good one, isn't it?  There's so much to get to.  Yeah.  Two more Dick Clark clips.  Here's one more.  Well, we have a brand new year filled with hope.  People are in the great boat.  And it won't be long before the free.  Yeah.  These people are on the rape.  Why?  Something like that.  Well, we have a brand new year filled with hope. 
[00:15:30]  People are in the great boat.  And it won't be long before they clean up Italy in New York did their party again.  What a terrific job.  What a party.  Now, the people who are here are going to remember it for a long, long time, Ryan.  They certainly will.  Thank you, Dick.  They certainly will.  That's my favorite part.  Like, he's not even attempting to have a little banter back and forth with Dick Clark. 
[00:16:00]  He's just tagging whatever he says and moving on.  Ryan, what do you think of that?  Dick, what the fuck did you just say?  See, that's what we would have said.  Yeah.  Hence why we're still stuck in fucking radio.  Year after fucking year.  Yeah.  Wow.  He said something about rape in a tree.  What is this Dick Clark thing all about, you think?  You think it's Dick Clark's ego?  You think it's an ABC thing?  You think Dick Clark has a lifetime contract to do this? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it's his...  Where's the problem?  Doesn't he produce it?  Isn't it?  Oh, God, yeah.  He's the boss.  It's his gig.  So can't they just cancel the show like they do any other show?  They could, but it's a fucking brand.  People watch it, too.  And they know Ryan Seacrest is the guy.  And once Dick Clark, you know...  They give Dick Clark from 11.45 to, like, 12.02.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all he has.  They know that, you know, he's going to check out at some point.  It's the weirdest thing going on. 
[00:17:00]  You know, now that we don't have Larry King to kick around anymore.  At least we got Dick Clark every year.  He's still a powerful guy, I guess, Dick Clark.  You know, he's like...  How is he a powerful guy?  He's Dick Clark.  I mean, he still has a tremendous amount of...  I don't know if it's...  His production company.  Yeah.  If he's in charge, I don't know.  That's why I want to...  Huh?  He's the boss of that whole fucking thing.  Yeah, he might be.  He doesn't even know he's the boss.  I'm the boss of you.  I think it's ABC, like, doing this for ratings.  Yeah, that's probably... 
[00:17:30]  I don't think Dick Clark is holding up ABC at this point.  I think they know people tune in just to see him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  I don't think they're saying, like, all right, let's see what a Messi is this year.  But they might know they're pulling him off.  Because there's so much competition now.  What else would drive...  Ryan Seacrest is not going to bring people to ABC.  Nah.  Nah.  Especially with MTV doing their thing and fucking VH1 and all these other channels doing their stuff.  Yeah, every single channel has somebody doing it now.  Well, here's Dick and Ryan doing a little banter, finally.  A little back and forth.  The last Dick Clark clip for this year. 
[00:18:00]  Well, we have another happy new year.  People are leaving here and now, but don't you go anywhere.  We have a lot more for you.  I want to thank you for tuning in tonight.  I hope to have a healthy and a happy new year from the bottom of my heart now.  I got a moan.  I want to...  I got a moan?  Uh-oh.  Did he say I got a moan?  I think it was.  Wait a minute.  What? 
[00:18:30]  He's got a moan.  Got a moan.  I got a moan.  I want to say there's a moment I've been waiting for.  Get this for an answer later.  Come here.  You had the guts to tell me, after you ran from the platform out here, that you're sweating.  We have a towel.  It's warm out there.  They may have a towel.  Wait a minute.  I've been out there with snow, sleet, rain, blizzards freezing my bones.  Dinosauruses. 
[00:19:00]  You had the guts to tell me.  It's running.  Sorry.  What was that?  What was that?  Holy mother of God.  And I know what that is, too.  When they don't have...  He's not looking at the wrap enough.  Somebody off camera grabs his ankle and just twists it really hard until he stops talking.  I had to go way back.  We had...  What is he talking about?  I don't know.  And he's running out of air again. 
[00:19:30]  They love the pants.  Wait a minute.  I've been out there with snow, sleet, rain, blizzards freezing my bones.  That's what I got to say.  Jenny, sorry.  Sorry.  Not my fault.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Great job.  Thank you.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.  So fucking uncomfortable.  That fucking kisses me off.  It'd be great if Dick tried to kiss him on the mouth. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, God.  Just that dry...  Ran out of air mouth.  By the way, do you know the laugh that Dick would have got if he said, freezing my balls  off?  Yeah.  Do you know what a fucking laugh is?  I was going to say that.  It sounded like...  And then I thought maybe freezing my butt off.  Freezing my bones.  What?  Not a good choice.  Yeah.  Balls would have been great.  Freezing my balls off.  I need to see you freezing my balls off.  I want to see Jenny Gump almost jumping out a window while he's on the street scene. 
[00:20:30]  Ten.  Nine.  She's running out the door and her boyfriend's passed out and old retard's over in Vietnam  doing something retarded.  Topical humor.  Yeah, shit.  It's still funny.  And this year, we'll do Dick Clark a favor.  Listen to this.  You see the year 1973 just flashing briefly.  When it hits there, you can bet your bottom dollar, it'll be pandemonium. 
[00:21:00]  Before it all happens, let me wish you the happiest of all New Year's and watch out.  It is now 1973 as of now.  No big countdown?  No.  That's the first one he did.  1973.  That's the first one?  Wow. 
[00:21:30]  So that's 38 years ago.  73.  1973.  Longer ago than that, huh?  Although I got...  Was it 40?  What?  73.  Maybe, yeah.  That's about 40 years ago.  30.  Yeah, I round up.  Oh.  And here's Dick Clark right before the stroke, 2004.  Yes, indeed.  It's getting closer and closer.  Count it down.  20.  19.  18.  17.  Et cetera, et cetera. 
[00:22:00]  We're going to get there.  Yes, indeed.  In 10.  9.  8.  7.  6.  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  Happy 2019.  2004.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  That was four?  Yeah, that's when we came back to radio, which is only a blink of an eye.  Yeah.  Oh, dude, he sounded good there, man.  And then...  Seven years, though, he's been doing this with the stroke?  Well, he took 2005 off because that was the year. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  And then he came back in 2006.  We're less than 30 seconds away from the big moment, and we're coming up in 20 seconds.  That's it.  30 seconds.  There it goes.  They're waiting in anticipation.  Oh, what a little bit.  There we go now.  Look at her.  Oh.  All right.  There it goes.  Down she goes.  50, 40, 13, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, wow.  So there you go.  How is...  That's how...  That's exhausting to do every year.  It's so fucking sad.  Rang in the do year for 2011. 
[00:23:30]  That's right.  I really didn't look at any internet, news, anything like that.  Took a break from everything.  What did the glasses look like?  What did the big 2011 glasses look like?  They just went with the hole in the one.  They went with the hole in the one?  Yeah, there's nothing else they could do.  That's fucking cheesy shit.  We did the bid and said it was over last year, so that's why we didn't really do it this year. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Most of the ones I saw, they just did the hole in the one, yeah.  Yeah, they got the two...  Oh, yeah.  They got the hole in the one.  They just did the hole in the one.  That's stupid.  So they gave up.  So now every year it's going to just be the hole in the one.  Hole in the two.  Hole in the fucking...  It's done.  Hole in the one for a while.  Yeah, hole in the one for a while.  The year 1001 must have been a great year for glasses.  That is really the best year.  Yeah.  1001.  Yeah, you're so right. 
[00:24:30]  That was the best year ever for the glasses.  Oh my God, you couldn't get any more.  They were just ecstatic.  Yeah.  They sold a shitload of those.  22, 2217 is going to be a real fucking shit year.  They're already predicting the out of glasses business.  The worst year ever was the 999.  Well, at least the 9s, you could kind of act like glasses and put the 9.  1999, they had the two holes in the 9s.  Yeah.  And that's what people were doing.  Yeah, but 999 just looks ridiculous. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, 999.  One 9 is going to be hanging off the side of your head.  Oh God.  It's all just lopsided with the 999.  At least the 1 balances out the numbers on your fucking face.  By the way, anyone wearing the date on your face's glasses should have them smashed in  by a giant fist.  Yeah, it should actually read 20 fist 1.  20 knuckles 1.  What year is that?  Can't tell.  Your nose bridge is shattered. 
[00:25:30]  There should just be a bunch of those split in half all over Times Square with blood on  either side.  Yeah, there's a 2-0 and then there's an 11 glasses smeared with blood.  And there's skin on both of them.  Fucking dopey glasses.  All right.  Whatever.  We did this break last year.  Now it's too late.  But that's a good design.  He's trying to even out the two with the exclamation point.  Oh, I didn't see the exclamation point.  No, you can't add the exclamation point.  No, it's too busy.  All right.  But really quick, because unfortunately we missed it, but I want to talk about the blizzard 
[00:26:00]  of New York City for two fucking minutes.  Well, did we get some snow here.  And boy, it showed what this city's made of.  Yeah.  There's all sorts of problems with this city.  Well, New York City got a big holiday snowstorm.  The day after Christmas, 18 inches, something like that.  About 18 inches in the city.  There's snow here?  Oh, yeah.  I was gone.  Where were you?  Yes.  You missed all the snow. 
[00:26:30]  I really did.  Jimmy was gone in the rain, actually.  Yeah, but then it was in Vegas.  It was beautiful.  Of course it is.  Right.  I had a great trip.  I saw some friends at the show.  Nice.  Who did you see?  I had a little lunch with Dana and had a little, I took a nice tour of the UFC facility.  Oh, really?  It was great.  How was that?  Phenomenal.  He's the noble chef's cooking for him.  Dana lives.  Wait, you went to his house?  Well, his office.  He invited me to the office.  Wow.  Fucking A.  How cool was that?  It was great. 
[00:27:00]  It was quiet.  Fuck what I have to say about stupid snow.  Let's listen.  Let's hear about Dana White.  It was very quiet because it was, you know, the holidays.  There was a lot of people out there.  We were getting ready for the fight, which happened last Saturday.  So the office was quiet.  Is it a nice office?  Phenomenal.  Do you feel like you want to be there?  Yeah.  And you also, he has a gym downstairs.  He has a ring.  And he showed me these guys were in the ring downstairs.  But they were just his employees.  Did you jump in and spar a little?  I started yelling, a judo, a judo, a chop, chop, chop.  You mean he has a cage? 
[00:27:30]  He doesn't have a ring.  A boxing ring.  It's a ring.  A boxing ring.  Where they could train for jiu-jitsu and stuff.  Okay.  But they were literally his employees.  They weren't even fighters.  They were like, oh, yeah, that's the guy that does accounting.  Everybody in that organization can kick the show.  It doesn't matter.  What job they have.  This is a guy that works in the mail room.  Yeah.  Making some guy tap out.  Yeah, that's Frankie over there in sales.  He's ripping Susan's clit off.  Practicing his arm bars.  So it's great.  On the HR lady. 
[00:28:00]  And I had a nice dinner.  You know, it's like we have so many people that pretend.  It's like I realized.  There's a lot of pretenders.  A lot of pretenders.  There's only a very few that when they say, hey, come see me when you're in Vegas or California,  they mean it.  And Dana White, obviously, is one of those guys.  The rest of them, their phone will ring forever and you feel like a complete douchebag.  Why did I even put myself in this situation and call this guy?  But I realize I'm bad at that.  Like, I'm very bad at socializing with people.  I really am horrible at it.  And I'm like, fuck it, man.  I'm with my girlfriend.  I mean, it's like, I know a lot of people out in Vegas. 
[00:28:30]  Why not?  I saw my buddy Reed Harris.  We had lunch from WEC.  And I said, I want to go see Penn and Teller.  He's great.  I want to go see Penn and Teller.  So I called their guy.  And then he goes, oh, yeah, Penn asked for your number.  He wants to go to dinner.  So fucking Penn took us out to dinner before the show.  We had a nice meal.  Where'd you go?  It's a place in the Rio because he was going right from there to the show.  Yeah, right on.  But I saw the show was unbelievable.  If you've ever seen Penn and Teller live, it was fucking unbelievable, man.  Literally. 
[00:29:00]  You watch it and go, I don't believe I just saw that.  Dude, they tell you.  All they do is tell you there's no such thing as magic and then fool you.  And then they completely fuck you over.  There's a couple of things they did.  I'm like, motherfucker.  Just complete illusion.  It's such an original, absolutely original twist.  Hey, man, where do I go now?  Because I went and saw Copperfield, and I don't want to ever see magic again after I saw that horse shit.  He's still pitching that it's magic.  And he also has decided I don't need to change my act in the last 10 or 12 fucking years. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, really?  He turned me off to all these guys, unfortunately.  So I got to go see Penn and Teller to get back in.  Because I used to love that shit.  They're great, dude.  I can't wait.  It's a funny show.  It's really smart.  Did you watch him play his bass?  Yeah, he's good.  I don't even like jazz.  Doesn't he warm up the crowd as they're walking in?  He plays stand-up bass, and there's a fucking amazing jazz pianist.  And I don't even like jazz.  Right.  But I went in just to hear him play an hour early. 
[00:30:00]  He was fucking great.  It was actually really the first time I've enjoyed jazz ever.  And then he leaves, and then there's like a 15, 20-minute break, and then he comes on with Teller, right?  Yeah, 10 minutes, and then him and Teller come out.  Sorry, go ahead.  That's okay.  And then I got home, and I got a message from Teller.  Yeah.  I didn't know he ever spoke.  Oh.  And he's got that play I'm going to go see in...  Wait, did you go out to dinner with Penn and Teller?  No, just Penn.  And then Teller called you?  Yeah, yeah, because I guess he knew I was there and we didn't see each other.  I don't know.  There was no sound.  Did you save the message?  Yes.  I can't play it on the air. 
[00:30:30]  He told you not to?  No, but I kind of know I can't.  You kind of know.  You don't want to blow on.  That's huge, though.  That's the guy's fucking gimmick.  That's his gimmick.  He has a play.  Remember Penn came in and plugged that play?  Yeah, it's right next to the comedy show.  Might have to check it out.  Yeah, I'm going to go tomorrow.  So, wait, Dana White.  So the facility's nice and...  It's great, dude.  It's fucking great.  He owns the building.  It's like...  He said, yeah, we started out in that broom closet.  That's where we started out.  That was where the office was.  That was it.  Wow.  And then they have that building and the building next to them.  Expanded.  Wow.  He sent me and my girlfriend back in a limo. 
[00:31:00]  He called a limo from a casino across the street and had us limoed back.  And then we went to the Stratosphere.  And she fucking went on all the Stratosphere rides.  I heard about this on your Twitter.  I was laughing at what a woman you are.  But I would be the same way.  They have something in the Stratosphere.  It's called the High Jump.  Where there's a platform on the top of the Stratosphere in Vegas.  Which is...  It's an 855 foot.  That's insane.  And you step out and you're held in by a harness. 
[00:31:30]  And you just jump.  Get the fuck out of here.  And you plummet.  No, thanks.  900 feet.  And it's not like you're on a ride.  You are being...  It's like a controlled descent.  You're doing 45 miles an hour.  Like a decelerator, they call it.  Yeah, but you don't slow down until you're fucking 30 feet above the ground.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  So you're convinced you're going to just fucking die.  I couldn't do it.  I wish I had the guts to do it.  Your girl did it?  Oh, we had to go back so she could do it.  She went on all the rides that were on the top. 
[00:32:00]  And then she made me take her back so she could do it.  I almost didn't do it.  I'm almost not willing to pay for that.  I'm like...  It's only 100 bucks.  It's horrifying.  But I'm like, if you die, I'm going to feel like...  Well, no one has died, though.  I know, but it just stopped three months ago.  That's all just in your head that you just can't get on.  My favorite...  Dude, look at the fucking...  The Stratosphere...  It's like jumping out of the 85th...  Wait.  Yeah, that's a...  This is really a...  A horrible video.  That's a terrible video.  But if you go to, like...  Just Google Sky Jump, and you can see people... 
[00:32:30]  She did it at night.  Does it bring you all the way to the ground?  Oh, dude, you land on the...  I was on the ground watching her.  I filmed from the ground, but you can't see...  Oh, you said 900 feet, right?  Yes, almost.  All right, 90 stories.  Yeah, that's almost 90 stories.  They say it's over 100 stories.  Get the fuck out of here.  All right, where's the jump?  My favorite tweet of yours, though, was the virtual rollercoaster one.  Oh, how humiliating.  Oh, you're just talking about how humiliating it was. 
[00:33:00]  And I've been on one of those at Disney.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  And, yeah, it's not comfortable.  We went to...  They just dangle you there, and then...  No, that's somebody falling.  They're not dangling.  They're falling.  That's somebody fucking...  Wait, that's the ride, though, or whatever?  Yeah, but you're just...  There's a string on your back.  Yeah.  And you're just coming down.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's not even...  You gotta see it from the...  They have a video taken from...  Holy shit.  A camera that goes down with you. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, damn.  But we went to New York, to New York, to a Cirque du Soleil,  because I wasn't queer enough going to the first Cirque du Soleil.  Thank you, my love.  The Cirque shows...  I loved them.  I liked the first one.  It was okay.  Wait, you went to see two of them?  Yeah, there was Cirque du Soleil.  Oh, we stayed at the Bellagio, which was amazing.  Oh, okay.  That's the water one, right?  Yeah, it was good.  And...  You just saw Kai.  We...  No, we went...  Kai was amazing.  We went to see Zumanity.  That's fucked up. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, that's it.  It literally slows you down 30 feet.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  They use that in the movies a lot,  when they're making somebody fall off a building,  and then they just, like, X out the cable.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's so scary to me,  especially because I was up there watching people jump.  I was...  During the afternoon, I was watching people from the window.  The way they do it is they put you in...  You have to put this thing on,  which holds your shoes.  It's like a little stupid jumping uniform.  And then, uh...  You go out onto a platform outside the stratosphere. 
[00:34:30]  And it just...  You step off.  She said the way it works is you're standing there.  Because I couldn't stand up there and watch her do it.  I had to be at the bottom.  And she said you stand on the platform,  and you have your feet are half off,  and they count down, and you just step off.  What if you don't step off?  Because they don't want you holding up the line.  There's only three people at a time on line up there.  Right.  I'm sure it's happened.  Well, at night?  To me, at night is easier, though,  because during the day...  I love how that guy just leans over.  Oh, you see the camera?  Yeah.  The guy just leans over to grab the bungee. 
[00:35:00]  Dude, he does that all day.  Like, it's no problem.  He fucking hangs out and grabs the bungee.  Get the fuck out of here.  But look at that little-ass platform.  It's the fucking 90th story of a building.  I mean, that's how high up you are.  Yeah, they look like they're in an airplane,  because you look at the city,  and it's just lights like you're landing in a plane.  It just looks completely unsafe.  But this is money.  They have to have some kind of system  where if you don't jump right away,  they either push you or say,  get the fuck up the line.  They'll pull you back in, I'm sure.  Because they can't hold up the line  because you're sitting there having a tough time,  you know, like the old days, 
[00:35:30]  jumping off a diving board or something.  It's not the 82nd Airborne over St. Mariglis.  Yeah.  You're tethered to a rope.  You're attached to a rope above you.  And then there's two ropes that are on the side of you,  two things,  and you...  Oh, this one's lame.  There's a camera that goes down.  The ones that go down with you,  you can't see how fast you're going.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's...  It looks like fun, though, doesn't it?  It just looks like...  Well, that angle looks like fun  because it looks like she's going down in slow motion. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, but you're moving.  Of course you are.  The illusion of speed you'd get doing it  would be sickening.  She said the hardest part was actually stepping off.  Of course.  She's like, when you're standing there,  she's like, you don't feel like you're falling that fast.  But when you step off...  Fuck that.  Because that goes against everything that your brain is saying.  Yeah, your brain is yelling, don't step off.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Stay here.  But now the virtual rollercoaster.  What happened?  At New York, New York, we were a little early.  And there's a rollercoaster in New York, New York.  I don't go on rollercoasters. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Ever.  I almost went on this one.  But I'm like, yeah, why don't you go?  I'll just wait here for you.  So she went and then she came off.  And apparently there was a virtual rollercoaster inside the...  I didn't know.  She's like, let's do that.  That'll be fun.  It's easy.  You don't leave.  You're not going anywhere.  It's got a screen in front of you, right?  Yeah, but you're...  Inside this...  A pod.  A pod.  Oh, you are inside the pod?  Yeah.  The pod moves.  Right.  So you get these sensations of gravity and G's and whatnot.  And then combined with the look on the screen, it fools your senses. 
[00:37:00]  I hate those fucking rides, by the way.  Well, she designed the course.  You can design the course computer-wise before you get in.  You can make it easy.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  You can make it nothing.  And then you can make it just looping and going crazy.  So we get in the pod.  And there's two young guys running the fucking thing.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, I feel claustrophobic already because it closes right over you like an egg.  You're strapped in.  Right.  And the music is like loud, like really bad 80s club music.  And I'm like, I might get sick in here. 
[00:37:30]  Just so you know, I might get sick.  I love it.  And then it's like a shh.  And you start moving.  And within three seconds, we had jerked left.  And then we flipped completely upside down.  The pod itself?  Completely upside down.  The pod.  The pod.  And there's an emergency button there.  The guy's like, if you have to hit that, hit that.  I'm like, I'm going to throw up.  I'm going to throw up.  And I hit the button.  Three seconds in.  Maybe five seconds in.  I hit the button.  And the guy actually, the machine goes. 
[00:38:00]  And it just turns back around.  Your chick had to be pissed.  She was humiliated because the guy comes.  He goes, he didn't even open the thing.  He goes, do you want me to stop it?  And I'm like, yeah, my neck hurts.  I got a problem with my neck.  I didn't have a problem with my neck.  It's the thing on top of your neck.  You're a dumb head.  Dude, it was fucking humiliating.  Wait, so you didn't restart?  That was it?  No, I get out.  Oh, that's great.  I'm like, do we have to go to a show?  I'm like, do you want me to throw up on both of us?  Because I will.  That's what happened. 
[00:38:30]  Did she just annoy the rest of the afternoon?  It was a night.  But you could tell, yes, she was irritated.  Why were you going to throw up?  Was it the physical aspect of it?  Motion sickness.  I had a very bad motion sickness.  Oh, was that it?  But you could close your eyes to take out everything.  Yeah, but not when you're fucking being spun upside down.  Yeah, that's true.  And the music is going.  You can't.  If you could just close your eyes, I thought I could do that.  I'm like, if I could get a pitch forward and back, I had to close my eyes.  But it was just too loud.  Poor Jimmy.  I think I would have done the same thing, I hate to say.  Dude, I hit the button.  I'm not a fan of that fucking thing. 
[00:39:00]  Five fucking seconds in.  Five seconds in.  You want to stop it?  The guy couldn't believe.  He was confused.  Like, was that a mistake?  I guarantee you that was a record.  No one's ever stopped it that fast.  But it was really fucking demoralizing.  He must have thought something accidentally hit it.  Yeah, like, did their partners come undone?  Obviously, they couldn't have wanted this stopped.  I should have gotten nervous when he said, hey, is there anything in your pockets that  might fall out?  I'm thinking, like, how would that happen? 
[00:39:30]  Why?  It won't be upside down.  It's virtual.  And I said to myself, they're probably just trying to make it more like a real rollercoaster  experience.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  I'm so stupid.  Right on, man.  Sounds like Vegas was a good time.  It was.  It was...  What else did you do out there?  Although that's a lot.  Well, it was basically...  I went to shows.  We went out to eat a lot.  And spas.  You know, we were in L.A. for five days first.  Damn.  I taped stuff, so she came up with me.  Damn, very good.  I never go on vacation.  It was fucking...  It was weird.  It was weird.  Did you enjoy it, though? 
[00:40:00]  I loved it.  Good.  I did miss doing...  You should do more of that.  I missed doing stand-up a lot.  I couldn't wait to get back on stage.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was way too long to be off.  Did you feel like you were, like, you had to get back up or you would lose something?  No, you just get...  I get bored.  I get very...  I miss it.  And it was enjoyable trips.  We had a good time.  Missed the snow and then came back.  We left Vegas.  It was 40 degrees.  It was warmer here.  So we got very lucky with weather.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking freezing weather. 
[00:40:30]  I hate it.  Yeah.  Oh, I got sick on Christmas.  You did?  Yeah.  I threw up nine times and I shit about 20.  That's food poisoning.  Merry Christmas.  What do you eat?  I don't know, but the night before I had eaten, like, these little crab things with mayo.  What are you doing?  Oh, no.  In Vegas.  I'm like, why would I ever eat seafood when there's no ocean?  If you have to fly in the seafood, I don't want it.  There could be a problem.  There's no crabs within a thousand miles.  Well, there's a lot of crabs in Vegas.  What are you talking about?  Well, you know, the kind you, like, you eat and want to. 
[00:41:00]  Do you think it was food poisoning?  Fuck yeah.  Dude, it hit me.  I woke up and I'm like, oh, I have to shit.  And I fucking walked to the bathroom and it was pure liquid.  And it kept happening.  Yeah, that's food poisoning.  Pissing out your ass like a chick.  Dude, fucking flu.  I actually was so bad, I got back in.  The next day I saw, like, brown droplets on the fucking bed.  Like, I must have had some on my little butt cheeks.  Oh, God, that's disgusting. 
[00:41:30]  It was.  And I finally just did the fingers down the throat an hour into it.  I'm like, look.  It's like, yeah, I'm getting it.  I gotta get this shit out of the way.  If this is food poisoning, whatever is here still has to go through my system.  Yeah.  Get rid of it.  So I didn't feel that sick.  I felt a little queasy, but I did the fingers down the throat.  And I just fucking, like, nine straight times emptied.  And then I shit for another six hours or so.  Was that mild food poisoning, though?  Because I think I would have been a lot more nauseous if it was a horrible case.  Technically, it's mild food poisoning.  Because, I mean, you could get food poisoning to the point you're in the hospital for days. 
[00:42:00]  You can, right?  Yeah.  For days.  Yeah.  If it's less than 24 hours, that's a mild case, more or less.  Yeah, I think that's what it was.  Because it felt like it had to be.  Maybe a medium case, let's call it.  Maybe you get just a little tiny food poisoning that, you know, just kind of just makes you miserable.  Doesn't make you shit water.  People tell me I'm crazy and paranoid because I always want my meat well done.  But that's why.  I don't fucking want to get sick.  Crabs, though.  Might have been the crab, yeah, but there was mayo in it.  Crab cakes and mayo?  No, no crab cakes.  They were uncooked crab.  It was good, though.  The treat was so good. 
[00:42:30]  What do you mean uncooked crab?  It was raw crab.  I don't think you could eat raw crab.  Sure you can.  Can't you?  No, I don't know.  I don't think you can.  Well, crab can go bad, can't it?  Yeah.  I think crab is one of those you really do have to cook.  Well, maybe this was.  When you go to a sushi joint, the crab is always cooked.  Oh, then it was cooked.  Okay, I'm thinking of crab like you.  I don't think you could eat crabs and, like, lobsters raw.  Or maybe it can.  It just doesn't taste right or something.  I don't know.  Maybe it was the crabs.  Or it could have been the oysters I had. 
[00:43:00]  Yes, but be sure they're very, very fresh or something.  That's probably what it was.  Whatever.  Wait, what's the answer to this?  You can.  You can, really.  I don't.  Yeah, raw crab.  Crab cocktail.  It's not cooked.  No, man.  I think all that's cooked usually, Jimmy.  Oh, maybe I'm wrong.  Okay.  We've got to figure this out.  It was something I ate.  I just don't know what.  I know it wasn't.  Probably the mayo.  Mayo is rough to keep fresh.  If that's sitting out less than two fucking minutes, you're done.  It was like a mayo dip. 
[00:43:30]  Like one of those mixed up stuff.  And I shoveled this stuff in.  I was so hungry.  Could have been anything.  All right.  We should take our first break.  Get into all the shit that happened during the break.  Oh, yeah.  Lots of stuff, actually.  I saw a movie.  All right.  We'll talk about that.  We'll talk about that.  The Town.  It's a good movie.  No, no, no, no.  Wasn't The Town?  No.  I liked it, too.  You liked The Town?  I did, yeah.  Jeremy Renner's great.  Yeah, I saw it.  I saw that stupid movie. 
[00:44:00]  It was a great movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I saw a, let's just say I saw a Western.  True Grit.  You didn't go to a fucking movie theater.  Yes, I did.  Oh, good.  All right.  We'll talk about True Grit next with Anthony.  Well.  What's up, everyone?  Getting back into the groove.  Yeah, the Jets are in the playoffs and blah, blah, blah.  People were bummed I wasn't trash talking yesterday, but they were playing the Bills and the game 
[00:44:30]  didn't mean anything.  Oh, Bills.  You know who we're playing in the playoffs, right, Ant?  Now who?  Jets are your team, you know.  Tell everybody.  I have no clue.  Playing the fucking Colts.  That's right.  They're playing the fucking Colts.  That's right.  The fucking Colts.  That's right.  Peyton Manning had a shitty year.  I think we're going to have no problem with the Colts Saturday night at 8 p.m.  Ooh.  Everybody get your feet out. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, Boise.  Fat cuck.  I love that fat cuck boy.  Service the African.  He's rubbing your wife's feet.  Before we went on a little break, we did talk about Rex Ryan and his wife's feet.  We certainly did.  Okay.  The first tape.  But now it's gotten a lot better.  There's an African gentleman.  Oh, no.  You haven't seen this?  Is it?  I've been fucking out of communicado since vacation. 
[00:45:30]  No sex, though.  I don't think there's anything to do with it.  They said there's some x-rated pictures.  Where have you been?  I've been fucking.  This is basic stuff.  No, I haven't done shit.  Especially.  Yeah, but when people aren't doing shit, that means they usually are doing a lot of shit  with their iPads and their iMacs and their iPhones and their smartphones.  She's sexy, though, man.  She's a lot of movies, a lot of TV.  Yeah.  You just turned off all communicates.  I was staying out of the computer thing for the most part. 
[00:46:00]  But you're a computer guy.  I was playing some games.  Mm-hmm.  Did you go away or something?  No, I got the Xbox Kinect.  Yeah.  So I was fucking around with that a lot.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You missed the...  This story is getting better and better.  She's a nice ass, right?  She's a pretty sexy older woman, man.  She would be an African gentleman.  She didn't do anything.  He's just rubbing her feet.  Rubbed her what?  What do you mean?  What do you mean she didn't do anything with it?  I don't know if she fucked him in the...  There's just not video of it.  Maybe, yeah.  Oh, you don't think a foot rub is something sexual?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Uh, well, Rex Rory...  His friends are giving him the business?  Of course.  What a fucking...  What a subservient black man he looks like, rubbing the white lady's feet.  He's taking a world of shit, too, that guy.  Oh, you know it.  Maybe that's Tony Rocky Horror.  Tony Rocky Horror.  He's going to get thrown off the fucking...  Out the window.  Well, no.  Smelling him.  Well, last...  Oh, yeah.  He's smelling her feet.  Yeah, last we left you, it was Rex Ryan, basically.  Or someone that sounds exactly like Rex Ryan, you know, commenting about his wife's feet. 
[00:47:00]  She's kind of just playing with him and stuff.  Into feet.  But since the break, now there's an African gentleman rubbing her feet.  Oh, my God.  Explosive.  More pics of NFL coach Rex Ryan's wife hit the net.  She's using her feet to freak off a brother.  To freak off a brother?  To freak off a brother.  Freak off a brother?  Here's a picture of her on her fucking hands and knees in a fucking little nightie with  her assholes obviously covered up.  Oh.  That's her?  Yeah.  It's supposed to be it.  What the fuck? 
[00:47:30]  If that's her, she's fucking sexy.  There's some shit going on with these two.  I love this guy.  Oh, and he just stands up there and is like, look, man, personal matter, go fuck yourself.  Is that what he's been saying?  Oh, yeah.  God bless him.  And they're frustrated because they want him to talk.  And he's like, fuck you.  Get ready for the Colts game.  She is like, really?  Yeah, they got...  The whole foot thing is huge with these two.  God, she has a great little fucking...  Looks like they got a...  Oh, God, there's fucking...  Look at this.  Wow, wow, wow.  Shots of her pussy open and everything, but they bleeped out.  Wow. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  Mediatakeout.com is where it says...  Wow.  Yeah.  It says, trust us, you really do not want to see the uncensored piss.  Oh, it's that bad?  But I want to.  I bet you it's a nice, fat, and hairy pussy.  There might be a huge tunnel there.  Oh, I want to see it.  So, wow.  Why won't they show it uncensored?  I guess they can't, man.  I don't know.  I'm sure it's uncensored out there somewhere else.  I would love to see these fucking...  That site has just chosen not to allow you to take away the big red star. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Or whatever they use on their site to cover up the naughty parts.  I would love to see that fucking...  Ooh.  There is some naughtiness going on in that relationship.  Yeah, they got one of those relationships, man.  They're letting their freak flag fly.  Oh, no.  I really hope it doesn't come out that he's...  Or cuckold.  He has sucking players' penises.  That'd be great. 
[00:49:00]  Fuck.  I love Rex Ryan.  I just hope it's not so bad that they have to just go,  Look, man.  You gotta...  Wow, here's more pictures.  Yeah, there's a lot of them.  In her underpants?  Oh, she's so nice.  You like her?  Yeah.  I'm not into older broads at all, as far as I'm concerned.  She's probably not my thing.  Oh, she's spreading it.  Yeah, that red star is...  Really annoying me.  It's like a Chinese red star.  They need a...  Wow, what is that?  A logo covering up that shot. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, maybe you could get in between.  The internet sucks.  They keep covering her vag.  We'll just fucking show it.  What do you mean the internet sucks?  That site sucks.  Oh, it's Harry, right?  Mm-hmm.  Is it Harry?  Oh, that's an old school pic, though.  Yeah.  She's been doing this for a long time.  How long have they been married?  Do they have kids?  Dirty girl.  Oh, she rules.  Yeah, that's their thing.  And the media, of course, just wants Rex to talk, and he's like, fuck you. 
[00:50:00]  See how good my boys look.  Do you think the fucking fans are going to be putting up foot signs or pictures of his wife?  The Colts?  Sure.  In Indianapolis, it's going to get ugly.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of foot jokes.  Nah, not good.  So.  And, yeah, the closer the Jets get to any kind of Super Bowl, they're just going to get worse and worse.  Slow around.  We've got to get past the Colts.  No, I'm just saying, like, it's just the abuse is going to get more and more the longer they're in it. 
[00:50:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her feet are nice, but her big toe kind of looks a little bit too much to the left.  That bothers you?  I mean, it's just.  Those feet have to be perfect, right?  Yeah.  I think so, sure.  He really digs them, and that African gentleman seemed to have liked them.  Rubbed a white lady's feet.  Hey, I guess the Giants missed the playoffs.  That sucks, huh?  Sorry, Giants fans. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, they.  I've never been a Giants fan.  They won their game.  They won, but they needed, like, a million other things to happen, I guess.  Yeah, they needed to not blow the fucking games that they blew earlier in the season.  They were 10-6, though, for the year.  That's a good record.  That should get you in the playoffs.  That's sort of on the cusp of making the playoffs usually, right?  10-6.  Yeah, they fucked up.  Jets were 11-5.  They haven't been 11-5 in a long time.  I think it's only the fourth time in franchise history.  Franchise.  That they won 11 games. 
[00:51:30]  In franchise.  So, but it was a boring day for football because just about every game didn't matter.  Yeah.  Gives a shit.  They gotta figure that shit out.  Yeah.  You can't have, like, the last week of a season mean pretty much nothing for just about every team.  Makes for a really boring day of football.  I guess sometimes that happens, you know?  Yeah.  And that happened this year, so.  They're trying to expand.  They want to expand to 18 games and maybe an extra playoff game or so.  I really, really beat these poor motherfuckers up.  Well, these preseason games are taken seriously now. 
[00:52:00]  They're beating the shit out of each other, so it shouldn't mean something, right?  Yeah.  All right.  That's it for football, I guess.  Oh, no, no.  Brett Favre retired for the 18th time, so.  And this time he says, it's for good.  That's it.  There's no way he's coming back.  He's coming back.  You think he is?  He's in such bad shape.  He will come back, mark my words, he comes back on a team that has a strong fucking quarterback 
[00:52:30]  and gets to sit around for the whole fucking year, maybe get in there if, God forbid, the  quarterback gets hurt and gets to play a couple games.  Like, Mark Burnell was on the Jets roster all year.  He finally played yesterday.  He could do that role easily.  You think?  Easily.  Well, how old is Mark Burnell?  Second or third string.  He's an older guy.  He's in his 40s, I believe.  40-something.  He's about the same age as, I think, Brett Favre is younger.  Wow.  Brett Favre will be back next year with a team that has a true starting quarterback. 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  He just can't be the quarterback for a team that really needs a quarterback, if that makes  sense.  I know it makes perfect sense, but wow.  There's rumors that Green Bay brings him back for that one game thing so he can retire  a Packer.  That old gag where they bring the guy back doesn't work enough.  That guy's fucking going to be so concussed.  Well, here's Brett Favre yesterday.  I just want to thank the NFL. 
[00:53:30]  I want to thank the Vikings.  Minnesota with two bad knees.  Not going to get that from this guy.  No.  Fans.  With a little big helmet.  It's been a wonderful experience for me.  This year did not work out the way we would have hoped, but that's football.  And I don't regret coming back.  I enjoyed my experience here. 
[00:54:00]  And again, I enjoyed my teammates.  It goes without saying.  The fans have been absolutely wonderful.  And, you know, I said this, it seems like it was two or three weeks ago.  Kind of had the same conversation with you guys.  It's been a wonderful ride for me.  Yeah, he's not retiring.  But it's like, enough with these fucking speeches.  Yeah, he's not retiring.  Just go.  You can hear it in his voice.  What an attention whore. 
[00:54:30]  You can hear it.  He's saying all this just in case.  Yeah.  A team's not interested in picking him up as the second or third string.  They're just going to hang out.  Terry in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Very mad at us.  Terry.  Oh, no.  Not Shivo, is it?  New York can't end the football talk without giving my Seattle Seahawks some props.  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to talk about the Seahawks.  What happened there is, well, they're going to the playoffs, and they won their division as a 7-9 team. 
[00:55:00]  How do you do that?  They do that shit in hockey, too.  I think if you don't have a 500 record, you shouldn't be allowed to make the playoffs.  And then they go somewhere else and maybe, like, get the Giants that went 10-6 or wherever you go, obviously,  and get a team that's over 500.  You can't be a sub-500 team and make the playoffs.  They've lost nine out of their 16 games.  Everyone else sucked more.  Oh, that division was horrendous this year.  The beauty is, I think now the 11-5 Saints have to go to Seattle now. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  The player, you get a home game in Seattle.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The Saints, who were 11-5, have a road playoff game.  Against the Seahawks.  The 7-9 Seahawks.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  Or the NFL at that point should at least go, okay, the Saints are 11-5.  They get the home field advantage.  Yeah, why did they?  The system is flawed.  Why did they get home field? 
[00:56:00]  I don't know.  Well, we won our division.  Yeah, they won the division.  Oh, wow.  That's really odd.  The Saints are in as a wild card.  Saints are in as a wild card at 11-5.  They won the division.  The Seahawks won the division at 7-9, so they get the home field advantage.  That's ridiculous.  Very silly.  The NFL has a problem there.  Divisions are stupid.  But the NFL has a problem.  That's just not fair.  Just have one whole league and they just play each other.  I love you guys.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year. 
[00:56:30]  But that's basic shit.  It seems like they can figure out.  Yeah.  At least give the team that has the better record, over .500 anyway, home field advantage.  Who was number one in the Saints division?  Who won the Saints division?  What was their record?  Atlanta was 13-3.  Oh, wow.  They had a great record.  Yeah, Atlanta had a great year.  I didn't know it was 13-3, though.  Holy shit.  What was the Cowboys final record?  Were they 6-10?  I don't know.  I don't know.  5-11.  They were 6-10. 
[00:57:00]  They were.  6-10.  They came back a little bit.  Second half of the season, right?  Dude, they had a couple of games.  And again, you were complaining about the Jets saying that there were a couple of games  they just won.  But there's probably at least two games.  I think Dallas was a little better than 6-10.  I think they were more of an 8-8 team.  And there was a couple of games that they probably should have.  They should have won the Saints game.  I mean, that's what makes the Saints better than them, is that they pulled it out.  But they were very close to winning the Saints game.  They didn't lose badly.  They could have easily been 8-8.  I'll be fair. 
[00:57:30]  The Jets could have easily been 8-8.  But any good team that closed like 11-5 could have been 8-8, but wins those games.  That's the difference between a good team and a team that shouldn't be in the playoffs.  The Jets are an 11-5 team that could have easily been 8-8.  Easily.  All right.  Here's the second half of Brett Favre saying he's not coming back.  Enough with Brett Favre.  Fucking go home, you girl.  He'll be back.  He'll back up like a Michael Vick or, I don't know, does the Pats need like a third-string  quarterback to kind of sit out the whole year and maybe come in for a couple plays? 
[00:58:00]  One game, one season does not define me.  You know, there'll be people who say, you know, it's a shame he went out that way or this and that.  But I am truly grateful for the opportunity.  It's the grace of God I got a chance to play this game and play it at a high level.  And, you know, I can sit here and think over and over again so many different people. 
[00:58:30]  But, you know, I'd be remissed if I didn't think Green Bay Packers, the fans.  It's kind of tough to say that and Vikings fans at the same time.  But it was special.  And it was special.  I mean, I don't know what else to say.  I mean, I think to play 20 years in the National Football League for a kid who had always dreamed of just playing in the NFL, 
[00:59:00]  not a whole lot different than most kids, to have accomplished the things that I was able to accomplish individually  and from a team standpoint, way more than I'd ever dreamed of.  I think that was yours.  Did you stop talking?  Yeah, I tapped out, too.  What a tension whore.  I'm checking my Twitter.  Just shut up.  Bless me from the start.  God, you said this already two years ago. 
[00:59:30]  You know, people appreciated the way I played the way I appreciated them.  Oh, fucking shut up.  It means no thing.  You stupid fucking safe on the head cock.  I'm getting killed on Twitter.  Manning set the single season completion record.  And I'm saying he had a shitty season.  Well, I have to say that.  I'm a Jets fan.  Stupid Peyton Manning had a shitty season.  I'm holding to that.  You're holding to it?  Yes.  Even though it seems like he had a great year. 
[01:00:00]  Fuck that.  Yeah.  What do you think of the Brett Favre?  There's nothing there.  No.  Whatever.  He's an attention whore.  Yeah.  It's over as far as being a starting quarterback.  But this guy will be playing football next year.  He absolutely will be.  He'll be an asshole, too.  Travis, he's going to sit the bench somewhere.  No, he's a starter.  He's going to play.  He can't help himself.  No, I think his ego.  Oh, you think he has to come back as a starter?  Yeah, if he comes back.  But I don't think he's coming back.  He can't.  He was humiliated this year.  The guy was fucking playing. 
[01:00:30]  He was exposed for being a two-all.  Yeah, he had like six touchdowns, nine interceptions.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  His head hits the ground.  He got beat up pretty good this year.  And he also had a fucking humiliating thing with that Jen Sturger.  It's like, you don't want to come back yet.  Jen Sturger's father says if he ever sees Brett Favre in an alley, because we all walk  around in alleys.  Alleys.  That Brett Favre is in trouble.  People are walking down alleyways.  I fucking hate this chick.  Twilight Zone episode.  I hate this chick because you can't.  I don't know. 
[01:01:00]  I was thinking about it.  Like, Terry Bradshaw is very respected in football.  Okay.  Yeah, but he's not walking around in a fucking G-string when he's not, you know, on TV doing  his football thing.  You look up Jen Sturger, all you see is all these model shots.  Well, there's one with her tits hanging out.  Yeah, I'm tired of her.  Damn.  I don't get it.  It's a typical phony victim shit.  And then half the time when she is on the sidelines in some of these photos when she was  working, she's all sexed up.  You don't see Terry Bradshaw or anybody else sexed up when they're doing their thing. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Looking at her picture from Maxson.  She's fucking hot.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, man.  Looking at Brett Favre's cock picture, I'm siding with her.  But why would anyone send a cock picture to her?  She's obviously a very, very talented, qualified individual to be in the Jets organization.  Yeah.  Obviously, look at her.  That's how most guys get where they are in the fucking football organization.  They take off their stupid clothes and stand there with their awful bodies.  That's great.  She's obviously qualified.  I think you're being sarcastic, Jimmy. 
[01:02:00]  I think you have a tough time playing it both ways, man.  There's lingerie shots.  She's hot as all hell, obviously.  Yeah, but if you hit on her, you're fucking sexually harassing her.  Right.  Brett Favre obviously got some kind of vibe.  You know?  Of course.  He got some kind of vibe.  You don't just send your cock picture to a stranger ever.  Of course not.  He got some kind of vibe.  Obviously, well, I don't even know if it's obvious.  He was wrong to think there was a vibe there.  He felt there was a vibe.  But he felt there was a vibe there.  And nobody, you don't just look, you don't just send your cock picture to a chick who 
[01:02:30]  works in the organization for no reason.  Right.  You don't just text a girl and go, hey, I saw you.  You're brand new here today.  Here's my cock.  Right.  It ramps up to the cock picture, obviously.  Sure.  He felt like, okay, this is ramping up.  It's time to send the cock pics.  I've sent Blatter and Gary my cock photos, but that was a year into it.  And that was after repeated LOL requests and winky faces.  And this guy's saying that Jen, John, go ahead.  I don't want to say what you're going to say again. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, Jen.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say, you guys are talking about how this Jen Sturger chick can't be  taken seriously.  I just wanted to mention she's going to be in Playboy next month.  Oh, yeah?  Seriously.  She's hot, man.  She's a fucking sexy girl.  She should be in Playboy, but she should also not be insulted if a guy thought he had  a vibe going with her.  Yeah.  No, she's wrong.  She should be treated like a hard worker.  And obviously, in the Jets organization, she's important to football.  She's qualified to be in the organization. 
[01:03:30]  Move your arm.  I can't see your cunt.  She's obviously very, very good at what she...  Yeah.  I want these fucking chicks.  I want Danny...  I see you have Jen Sturger ass.  Just put Jen Sturger in there and find one picture where she's not sexing it up.  Just one.  We interviewed her.  Because she wants people to take her seriously in the sports world.  So find me one picture where you could look at her and go, oh, she's a hot-looking girl  and you could kind of take her seriously.  Maybe that one?  She's still looks...  She's going to look good no matter what.  Because she just looks good.  Yeah, but every picture... 
[01:04:00]  The point is, if you Google her...  But she's really sexing it up.  There's a lot of...  That's her on the sideline doing a little whatever.  She's using...  She's got a hat.  She's using her sexuality.  Well, she's dressed like a woman of her looks would look.  She's using her sexuality.  Well, yeah.  Which is fine.  But that's like saying, you know, the players are using their athleticism in that picture.  I mean...  One of our boys...  That wasn't crazy, out-of-control sex stuff.  I'm a little nervous because one of our boys called her, I think... 
[01:04:30]  I don't even want to say it just in case it wasn't what he said.  Chad Dukes, our boy.  He made a couple of the websites.  And I'm like, fuck, they're going to fire him.  I think he called her a war.  Oh, damn.  So what?  I think that's the big headline.  Yeah, whatever.  To her face on the...  Huh?  To her or just said it about her?  No, because everyone's talking about this story.  Because the reason why this is hot again, the NFL fined, what, Brett Favre 50,000? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  And one of the Stengel brothers that works for Letterman said he got fined about 10,000...  Wait, how did he say it?  12,000 an inch or something?  12,000 an inch or something.  Yeah, it was a very funny line that I just completely fucked up.  What does it say?  Radio host calls Jen Sturridge a whore.  Oh, no.  In a tweet.  In a tweet.  Now they're reporting Twitter as news?  In a tweet.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's a friend of the show, right?  Yeah, I love those guys.  It was Chad. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, Chad Dukes.  So...  Again, what a baby country.  Did he hear what he said about her?  Give a fuck.  On a tweet.  To me, he's allowed to say that because if she's going to be posing nude in Playboy, he  is allowed to say whore because that's his opinion of someone who does that for...  If his opinion of a woman is out of a whore...  They only fined Brett Favre...  Because the NFL knew they had to do something, so they fined him $50,000 for not cooperating.  And the NFL, we've all learned this year especially, is really, really tough. 
[01:06:00]  So if they really thought something was going on, they would have, quote, thrown the book  at Brett Favre.  They fined him for not cooperating.  That's what he said.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But that's the whole point, is that, you know, it wasn't for the pictures or anything, and  they didn't dig any deeper.  Right.  Yeah.  They said they couldn't prove it was his penis.  They didn't say that.  Yeah, they did.  They officially said that?  Yeah.  They can prove it.  Oh, that's hilarious.  They said they couldn't prove it.  They can prove it, you can take a fucking picture of his penis. 
[01:06:30]  Or just compare the hand.  Yeah.  I think they have a lot of fucking video on Brett Favre's hands at this point.  The forensic analysis could not establish that Favre sent the objectable, the objectionable  photograph.  Sam, it was his penis.  I've seen many penises, Sam, and that little teeny tiny head belonged to Brett Favre.  Roger Staubach had one like that from being sacked.  Let's go to Mikey in Florida. 
[01:07:00]  Mikey.  Hello.  Hey.  Happy birthday.  Yeah, thanks a lot, Mikey.  Wishing me a birthday in the middle of Quincy.  I don't know if you remember.  When this chick was at FSU.  Nobody remembers that.  Her shtick was to show up at games with her tits hanging out of a tank top and a cowboy hat on.  And when you were interviewing her, she talked about how she got noticed because Brent Musburger,  the announcer on ABC, pointed her out and was like, 1,500 red-blooded Americans just signed 
[01:07:30]  up to go to FSU.  And when she was on your show, she called him a disgusting pig for saying that.  For pointing out the fact that she had her tits hanging out.  I got a bad vibe from her when she was in here.  She annoyed me.  There's nothing I hate more than a chick who uses her sexuality and then fucking cries like  a victim.  Again, if you grab her, that's one thing.  Yeah.  Where's the interview we had of her?  Do we have it?  Can we get that clip?  We've been asking about it for weeks.  I don't know why we've never played clips of our interview with her. 
[01:08:00]  It would be very telling.  Because it's just me trying to fucking bed her.  That's true.  Is that what it was?  It kind of ruined the interview.  I kind of remember that there was a lot of Anthony kind of being a little bit of a creep  talking about how hot she was.  No, but she mentioned something about a player.  There was something there.  Yeah.  I think she hinted that she had something going on that was going to come out.  All right, brother.  Terry Bradshaw shaves his pubic hair.  I would know his cock anywhere, Sam.  It's only on the sides. 
[01:08:30]  He has none on the top.  He's bald down there like he is on his head.  If they wanted to find out if it was Brett Favre's penis, they should have called Detective  Monaghan.  Oh, Monaghan.  He knows every cock in the NFC.  Not so much the AFC.  Quincy.  Look, forensics can't prove that it's his cock.  That's right.  Come on.  They knew it was Michael Vicks.  It was a lot bigger because he's black.  Those Africans are built really big. 
[01:09:00]  Just act Detective Monaghan.  His wife is having her feet run by an African.  The NFL should have lined up quarterbacks and made them all show their cocks.  Yeah.  Show your cock.  Jen Sturger to pick out the cock.  That's the offending penis.  Throw a Michael Vick in there.  Peyton Manning.  You got to think his cock is just god awful.  Fuck the Colts.  They did like five bong hits before SportsCenter. 
[01:09:30]  That's probably what we've come across that.  You're just listening to it?  Okay.  Let's go to Jimmy James.  JJ.  Hey.  Happy New Year, fellas.  Hey.  Hey, I just want to do a back opium on Manning having a terrible year.  It's actually, if you go to comparison, Tom Brady has 339 pass attempts since his last  interception.  The Mannings since that time have combined for 31.  Combined for 31. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, 16 for Eli and 15 for Peyton.  I'm not going to lie, man.  Brady's an animal this year.  It's going to be really tough to beat those fuckers.  Fucking Brady had a ridiculous year.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, fuck the Manning brothers.  Although Peyton was on our show and he was really nice.  Remember how nice he was?  Down to earth.  Nice guy.  We were one of 50 stations he called on one of those fucking horrible press junkets.  You know what?  Yeah, you're right.  He was very nice. 
[01:10:30]  Fuck that blockhead.  Another worthless athlete interview.  Blockhead with eye sockets.  Fuck you.  It's going to get ugly, man.  Fucking playoff football is here.  I'm taking on all of Indianapolis.  You too, Ed.  It's your team.  Of course.  I'm going to be keeping tabs of all the Jets shenanigans.  I remember my friend Chris got mad at somebody and he just snapped and called them a dumb,  dumb lunkhead.  I love lunkhead.  But a dumb, dumb lunkhead.  Lunkhead. 
[01:11:00]  Awful insult.  What an awful insult.  What's the other one?  Dunderhead?  Dunderhead.  I love Dunderhead.  I like adult.  Yeah, adult's good.  Someone said adult.  Yeah.  I hope our Chad Dukes is okay with what happened to him.  He made some headlines over the break.  Oh, no.  He said it to her on the phone.  What did she say?  No, no.  He was talking about it like we're talking about it.  And then kind of just tweeted, you know, what he felt.  I don't know what the whole story is there, but it's obvious she likes to show her fucking  body all over the place. 
[01:11:30]  And then she wants to be taken seriously in sports.  And that's a little confusing for people.  Confusing for a lot of people.  Obviously, it was very confusing for Brett Favre.  He was thinking there was something there.  He thought she was ready to get a cockpit.  Right.  You got to really make that decision with a lot of forethought.  That means there had to be some of that flirting going on, back and forth.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't open with a cockpit.  Never open with a cockpit, unless you're an amateur or a rookie.  No.  Fucking rookie. 
[01:12:00]  It's some jibba jabba, and then cockpit.  But you must have some jibba jabba beforehand.  Jibba jabba.  All right.  Where were we?  Brett Favre, True Grit?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I spent a lot of time over vacation watching a lot of television.  I love the marathons.  Sure.  Love the marathons.  Twilight Zone marathon, of course. 
[01:12:30]  But it's getting to the point now where I watch Twilight Zone, and I'm just like,  ah, here's another episode where they think they're dead, and someone suggests they're in hell.  Is there a lot of them?  I think we're dead, and we're in hell.  Da-da-da commercial, and then they come back and, you know, figure out that the aliens  had taken them and put them in a zoo somewhere on their planet and decorated it up like Earth.  Did you have any time to watch any of the Real Housewife marathons?  No.  Real Housewives of Put Dumb City Here? 
[01:13:00]  I steer clear of those shows.  I'm all in with the Atlanta Housewives now.  You're in?  No.  Oh, you're giving me the look like a faggot.  No, there was one show like that that I watched, though, but not Housewives.  Bridalplasty?  No, I watched the Millionaire Matchmaker.  I actually liked it.  The Millionaire Matchmaker.  Did the fat broad appear yet?  Jesus.  There's a fat, smelly broad that's a millionaire.  Oh, she's in the gums.  She was in the preview for the next episode.  Yeah, where she's riding the bicycle. 
[01:13:30]  Gums McGillicuddy.  Oh, dude, she was all fucking gums.  Gums McGillicuddy, man, but she's a millionaire, so you know guys want in.  When she smiled, it looked like a pink highway with chicklets along the bottom.  Yes.  Fucking fat.  So anyway, a lot of TV.  Yeah, a lot of TV.  I watched that.  I noticed a few other things also during the holidays.  This goddamn motherfucking Hyundai commercial with the chick and the fucking guy and the band.  And she's not looking in the camera, and she's disturbing. 
[01:14:00]  Dude, I...  But, you know something?  Every time that commercial came on, I was looking up.  Like, God, I was annoyed.  I tweeted last night, I think that is the most overplayed commercial in the history of TV now.  It just kept playing.  It has to be right up there.  And playing.  And I thought when Christmas ended, I thought the commercials would end.  No, no, no.  And now we're into, what, January 3rd.  This commercial was playing all night last night still.  Last night still playing. 
[01:14:30]  There's just something about driving a new Hyundai this time of year that puts a song in your heart.  Check out all the great deals during Hyundai holidays at your local dealer.  From everyone at Hyundai.  Don't get me wrong, I'd probably fuck her.  Yeah, but...  But...  Enough already.  Such a hipster.  They're two hipsters.  You don't like the hipsters. 
[01:15:00]  I'm not a fan of the hipster.  And, yeah, Hyundai just came to these two and decided to...  Well...  Because they're internet sensations, apparently.  They're YouTube sensations.  Well, if you want to get a hold of them, because we all have on Twitter, it's Pomplamoose.  I think that's how you say it.  Yeah, that's...  P-O-M-P-L-A Moose on Twitter.  That's who they are.  That's their band or whatever it is.  And Hyundai decided they were going to let them do a commercial. 
[01:15:30]  Look, it was unique and different the first thousand times you saw it.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Because there's two commercials.  There's three.  There's three.  I know they did Jingle Bells, the one we just played.  They did Jingle Bells, they did the Ho Ho Ho, and then they do another one.  Who are they?  They're out of fucking San Francisco or something.  There are a couple of groovy people.  They're like, yeah, we're doing a book drive.  And, you know, yeah, man.  They're kind of, you know, hipsters. 
[01:16:00]  We're supposed to be more than lighting up the Christmas tree.  More than filling up our socks with toys.  More than all of this tremendous noise.  They do covers of, like, other songs.  Other people's songs. 
[01:16:30]  And it's edited in some weird fashion.  Yeah, there's something about it.  You know what?  They're at least different.  And that's what they've been doing on YouTube for a while.  And then Hyundai picked it up.  And they just did it at their house.  In their garage.  And they let her edit it and everything.  Are they a couple?  I don't know.  They lived together, I think.  She's got a great voice, too, man.  But that Hyundai commercial just drove everybody nuts. 
[01:17:00]  Overexposure.  It would just get fucking stuck in my head.  Over and over and over again, right.  Over and fucking over again.  And good point, by the way, where she doesn't really look at the camera.  She doesn't look at the camera.  It's like this odd fucking, like, weird, weirdo look she gives.  But she's doing that on purpose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what makes it so fucking weird.  She knows exactly what she's doing.  And she might smile occasionally.  She knows how to almost look at the camera.  Yeah, yeah.  That's her thing.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is. 
[01:17:30]  That.  I was watching that.  Stephen King marathon on SyFy, of course.  There was Langoliers and then The Stand.  And wow, those movies are bad.  Oh, my God.  It is atrocious.  I started watching a little bit of The Stand, and I realized that Stephen King is an odd  genius as an author.  Yes.  But when he gets involved in the TV production, he fucking blows. 
[01:18:00]  It is so bad.  The acting, the casting, like everything, it's horrible.  And they all look like they belong on Lifetime with the production quality.  Yeah, yeah.  They're fucking horrid.  The special effects, now I do understand, this was kind of early to mid-90s, and the  special effects, though, were so God-awful.  He has to let other people just do them.  Other people adapt his stuff for screen better than he does.  Look at things like, what was his?  Shawshank. 
[01:18:30]  Shining.  Carrie.  Yeah, anyone where he's just like, yes, my story.  All right, that's all we need.  Go away.  Just leave.  And he puts himself in there.  He puts himself in the movie, and at the end, like when Stu Redman's coming back with  the retard and the fucking snowcat thing, and it's Stephen King and fucking Bobby Brady.  They cast Bobby Brady with him.  Wait, don't look out. 
[01:19:00]  I think it's Stu.  Stupid fucking Stephen King who can't act their dog.  He was coming back for what?  He was coming back from, you know, his little mission there that the old black woman sent  him on.  I don't remember.  I had a soap in Vegas.  The book was good.  I was hanging out with that black woman telling me what to do.  Mother Abigail.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm going to Vegas.  Did he still call, did they call Randall the walking dude?  Yes.  I always hated that name.  The walking dude.  It was very corny.  That's really a terrible name. 
[01:19:30]  Very corny.  So I was watching that.  I got to the point where I just, it's kind of the end of vacation, you know, New Year's  weekend, and vacation's wrapping up, so I was really doing nothing.  I was just laying on a couch watching horrific TV.  Just laying on a couch drooling.  Just drooling, watching bad television.  And, uh, but, uh, I, I did get a chance to see True Grit.  No, that's with Jeff Bridges.  Jeff Bridges. 
[01:20:00]  Who played, uh, the True Grit guy originally?  True Grit.  That was the Duke.  Yeah.  John Wayne.  That's right.  You're John Wayne.  That's right.  Uh, my review of the movie?  Loved it.  Really?  Thought it was really good.  Bridges was good?  It's a good, uh, good, uh, Western.  Bridges is on a roll.  Modern day fucking Western.  He, he was good.  The only thing that was hard to get past is his on the money, impeccable impersonation  of Carl from Sling Blade.  Oh, really?  His fucking voice when he's talking, especially when he's testifying in court in the beginning 
[01:20:30]  about shooting people, uh, he sounded just like fucking, uh, Carl from Sling Blade.  We all know you love Carl.  I love the Carl.  Uh, but, uh, the movie itself, I, I liked it.  I really did.  It was, it was good.  It was a good, good, good Western.  A good modern day there, Western there.  What do you mean modern day?  It happens now?  No, no.  It happens, you know, in the, in the oldie days.  But, um, it's, it's done up in a good way where, you know, modern, modern cinematography and 
[01:21:00]  shit.  Yeah, it's getting great reviews.  Things like that.  Is it doing well at the box office?  Or is everyone too busy watching the little fuckers?  Well, somebody said, uh, when they went and saw it in the, in a movie theater and, um,  it was the nicest, quietest group of white people they've ever seen in the movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't look like a very, a movie where you get a diverse audience.  But, uh, little fuckers, now that, on the other hand, got a guy and a Marine and his, 
[01:21:30]  um, uh, wife or girlfriend, uh, got the shit beat out of them because they had turned around  to a row of black gentlemen and asked them to please have some respect and be quiet during  the movie.  Uh, and as they then left the theater at the end of the movie, got the shit beat out of  them, uh, one guy actually came up to the woman and belted her right in the face.  Black, and were they a white couple?  Uh, yeah.  I haven't heard about that. 
[01:22:00]  Why would you?  And, um, the, uh, an arrest, a few arrests were made, were made, some tasings, and then  they showed a big fat pig woman that was arrested for, uh, trying to prevent an arrest from going  down.  Where was this?  You know how they'll jump in?  Where was this?  I don't know, some shithole, I'm sure.  But I was just like, you know, where, where, where's the, where's the story?  Yeah, I didn't, it's not in any of the New York papers.  No, why would it be?  Although, when, when Fat Nick beat those three car thieves, all they could show is the one 
[01:22:30]  young man in his military uniform.  Of course, of course.  Fucking hate the media.  This is a Marine, just got back from Afghanistan, and, uh, he's got to deal with thugs beating  the shit out of him.  And a guy punched his chick?  Yeah, and then a guy, uh, ran up, uh, to his girl and said, I'm gonna hit you.  And just punched her right in the fucking face, knocked her down on the ground, knocked  her out.  It's like, man, fucking assholes.  Maybe the guy just didn't like the little fuckers.  Yeah.  And had to take out his, take out his anger. 
[01:23:00]  Ah.  He was pissed off it wasn't as good as the original, uh, Meet the Parents.  That's a different one.  Let's see.  The Marine and his wife, beaten by teen mob.  Teen mob.  Uh, he was on leave from Afghanistan.  Florida Theater and the couple asked on a really group of teenagers, how do you know they're  black?  He doesn't say this in the article, doesn't mention the color difference in the article.  I find out on other websites.  I do my, my research.  Believe me.  I go to some websites where they point out race.  He saw one of the teens punch his wife in the face, knocking her out as she tried to 
[01:23:30]  get to safety.  Yes.  Yeah.  Isn't that nice?  Isn't that great?  And, and, and people wonder why I don't go to the movies anymore.  I can't deal with that shit.  What a fucking.  I had one run in with some Hispanics once and that was it for me.  No more movies.  Build one in my house.  Thank you very much.  I'm staying home.  But it's, again, it is just amazing that you do not see one fucking mention of what  would be mentioned. 
[01:24:00]  And I know people are sitting here.  Yeah.  If it was two black, uh, a black couple, black couple.  And one of those white teens punched that black woman in the face.  And a mob was beating up on the black guy.  And a mob beat a black Marine up.  Right, right.  It would be headline news.  It absolutely would be.  But black people, by society, are expected to behave that way.  Yeah.  So when you do, it's not news.  And that's, that's, that's this, the attitude of the media.  Yeah.  How is that not being reported as a hate crime? 
[01:24:30]  Yep.  Watch it be like the, the, the Marine couple's black too and we just don't know what we're  talking about.  No, it's on conservativenation.net.  I guess the white couple attacked by dozens of black youth, uh, in Florida, uh, movie theater.  Yep.  Um, yeah, it's just another one of those situations where you're like, ah, come on, man.  I'm just, I'm so disgusted and, and numbed by it now.  It doesn't, I don't even fucking go off anymore about it.  Whatever.  I sit at home and I, I just, I just yell things. 
[01:25:00]  Punch the wife in the face.  The privacy of my own house.  Yeah.  Ran right up to her and punched her in the face.  And this is a guy who was, you know, fighting over in Afghanistan.  You think they'd give a shit?  This guy would give a thought.  I guarantee you.  I can't guarantee you.  Now I wonder if anybody in the crowd helped them out.  Well, this guy was at the movie theater.  Let's find out.  One guy, one guy did a good Samaritan.  They said broke the thing up by pulling a gun on the crowd.  He had a gun on him.  Pulled it out.  But the rest of the crowd was just watching it happen?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Of course.  Why would they help? 
[01:25:30]  We got a guy that was at the movie theater.  Rick in Florida.  Rick.  Hey, what's going on, gentlemen?  Hey, brother.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, I was there, and they were black.  I had a gun with me, too, because I always carry a gun with me.  Wherever I go, I carry a Ruger 9mm.  But I was coming out when all the ruckus was almost finished.  What happened was one of the kids, when the deputy responded, because they called the sheriff's  deputies to come out there, one of the kids was so, you know, iggied up from fighting  that he hit a deputy, and the deputy said, enough of that. 
[01:26:00]  Taste him.  And basically dispersed the crowd right away, because a whole bunch of deputies got there.  I'm like, I'm coming out with my wife, and I'm like, what the hell is going on here?  And, you know, you could see that it was a bunch of thugs and a bunch of, hey, what's  up, you know, with their pants hanging out.  Of course they were.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, fuck it up.  But again, I wouldn't mind it as much if it was reported like that, but they just refused  to fucking say it.  Jimmy, it's just teens.  They fucking refused to acknowledge. 
[01:26:30]  Race is never brought up unless it's the other way around, and then it's always brought up.  Always.  Can somebody give me a reason, like, really, is there anybody that can give a justifiable  reason, a black, white, anybody, that can give a justifiable reason why it's just not  addressed?  Liberal media.  God, I hate to keep saying it, but it is that.  It really is.  It's just awful.  That one's been just fucking chewing at me since I heard about it. 
[01:27:00]  I'm just like, you know, fucking people.  Marina's wife beaten by a mob, and if it was reversed, fucking every faggot reporter would  be writing it, and every pussy news anchor would be writing it.  Oh, yeah. </pre>
