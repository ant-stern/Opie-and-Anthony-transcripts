<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a segment dedicated to listener calls about recurring dreams, specifically those involving infidelity.  Callers shared anecdotes of waking their partners in anger due to these dreams, prompting a discussion on dream interpretation by the hosts. One host recounted a dream about a bridge, inspired by a film depicting suicide.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of a Maxim magazine interview with Mike Tyson.  The hosts read excerpts, mimicking Tyson's aggressive and vulgar tone, focusing on his extravagant lifestyle (including Bengal tigers), prison experiences, and use of Prozac and Zoloft.  Tyson's boasts and threats were a prominent feature of this segment.

Next, the show tackled Keith Obermann's use of the Nazi salute on television, prompted by an Anti-Defamation League letter.  A guest joined the hosts to debate whether this constituted free speech or offensive behavior, also touching upon Bill O'Reilly and the nature of comedy.  Rich Voss's impromptu street performances in New York City were briefly mentioned.

The show then featured a live stand-up performance by comedian Rich Voss at Rue 57 in New York City.  His set was marked by awkwardness due to the small, seemingly disinterested audience.  He attempted older material and interacted with audience members, including a humorous exchange with a man from Bangladesh.

Following Voss's performance, the conversation turned to relationships, specifically focusing on Patrice O'Neal's experiences with non-monogamous relationships. O'Neal described his relationship with his lesbian girlfriend and his attempts to add another girlfriend, using a "trickle-down" analogy.  This led to a frank and often vulgar discussion about sex, relationships, and maintaining passion in long-term relationships, featuring Vinnie and numerous callers sharing their personal experiences with monogamy and non-monogamy.

"Mr. DVD," a Netflix employee, joined the show in-studio.  The segment focused on upcoming DVD releases, with Mr. DVD offering opinions and details on various films, including *Shrek*, *Planet of the Apes*, *The Grinch*, *Apocalypse Now*, *The Godfather*, *Almost Famous*, *Go*, *Boiler Room*, and *Final Destination*.  He highlighted special features, using colorful language at times ("retard," "wacky"), and engaged in banter with the hosts and a caller, Doug, whose nonsensical complaint fueled further playful exchanges.  The hosts also referenced *Miller's Crossing* and *An Officer and a Gentleman*.  Mr. DVD's appearance concluded with plans for a return on Friday.

[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Hey, I'm going to give out some advice today.  It's simple.  Because all night long, you're going to be thinking about jumping. 
[00:04:30]  You're going to be talking to your brain that well when you're dreaming.  Toward a bridge?  Toward a bridge?  What the F?  You've got to watch happy things.  You've got to watch happy things.  I've tried that same thing with porn and it doesn't work in your favor.  You watch a porn just before you watch it.  You watch a porn just before you go to bed thinking, all right, I'm going to have some great sex dreams.  Nah, it doesn't work that way.  But a movie about suicide and people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, well, it works now. 
[00:05:00]  All night long, in my dream, I'm just walking toward a bridge and have that panic and that fear and that stress as I'm trying to dream.  Do you jump?  Of course I don't jump.  You know, if you hit the water in your dream, you really die.  It's true.  It's true.  Nathaniel just said it's true.  Yeah.  I love that.  You heard that growing up all the time.  You know, when you've fallen in a dream, yeah.  You know, if you're a hit, you actually die.  Dude, my aunt has a dream book. 
[00:05:30]  Who told you that?  Who told you that?  And what your dream means, you walking toward the bridge all night long, means?  Means I watched a movie.  Right, that's all it means.  With people jumping off a bridge.  You're thinking of going in a different career path and, oh, shut up with your dream book.  I love the dream analysis, yeah.  You know what it means?  It means I was watching a movie or a TV show or I did something today. 
[00:06:00]  It just reflects back in your dream.  It doesn't have to mean something so deep.  Anyone ever get this one?  Your chick dreams that you're cheating and then she's mad at you the next day?  You ever get that one?  Wow.  You ever get that one?  What?  No.  She dreams that you're cheating.  She wakes up and she's mad at you.  She's mad at you for dream cheating?  For dream cheating.  I'm like, but I didn't cheat.  Wow.  But what did I do?  Huh?  What did I do?  Right.  You were cheating in my dream. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  I saw it.  I was watching you with another girl.  And what?  But it was in your head.  Right.  What happened?  How do I get out of this trouble I'm in?  I'm not alone.  That's why you just play stupid and you ask her, how do I get out of this problem I'm  in right now with you?  Dan, you're going to admit to something?  Yes.  I, uh, yes.  I've had a girl, actually, she woke up, she recoiled across the room and wouldn't let me  touch her for the rest of the night because she dreamed I was cheating on her. 
[00:07:00]  See?  I'm not alone.  That's a biggie.  Would you meet her, NYU?  Without that dream part.  It sounded really creepy.  She's just recoiling and staying away from you.  I led with the wrong information.  Yeah, yeah.  Should have said she had a dream and the result was...  You have a two-headed goo-goo stick.  Wow.  What was the dream?  Yeah.  You must have done something awful in that dream.  I think I hooked up with her sister in it.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  That's a bad one. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, she was...  Get away from me.  What?  I just...  And you can't comfort them because they think you're the a-hole.  It's like, baby, baby, go back to sleep and dream that I just got you a car or something  really nice.  I did something nice for you.  You try to talk to them logically like, well, but I was dreaming I was flying.  Yeah.  I can't fly.  Did you ever have a dream, and this has happened to me a couple times, where I dreamed about  being with this really hot chick, not my girl, some other girl, really hot, like a Spanish 
[00:08:00]  girl, and I'm making love to her and doing all kinds of kooky stuff, and then I wake up  and I'm actually having sex with my girl, and I just go, oh, buddy.  Oh, boy.  It's like you wake up in a dream.  Wait, you're actually in the act?  I'm in the act.  I'm actually, in my dream, wind up, like, I guess, touching my girl on a chest or something,  and it triggers off this sex dream, but it's with this other hot girl that I don't know  that's not real.  Right, so you're dreaming that. 
[00:08:30]  And then you wake up, and you're actually having sex.  You're actually...  But you've actually gotten to the point where you're technically completely doing the act.  No, no, no.  Not like I'm making out, and I'm touching, and I'm doing what I was doing in the dream.  Like, almost just about to, you know, have sex, but I'm grabbing booze, and I'm taking  out.  That's pretty resourceful if, like, you're dreaming, but you're actually doing it.  But my girl now is fully awake and thinks I'm making moves, but really, I'm having sex 
[00:09:00]  with her, but she's somebody else.  Oh, no, and she could just look, and your eyes would be closed.  You'd be drooling.  Yeah, but then I roll over.  Then you get a rollover and pretend you're asleep.  That's happened to me a bunch of times, I swear to God.  We hit on something here.  Tom in New York City.  Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Good morning.  Yo, a couple weeks ago, my wife wakes me up in the middle of the night.  She's like, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I just had a dream that you would  cheat.  She would talk to me all day, bro, and I had to explain it away. 
[00:09:30]  It was ridiculous.  It was funny, but ridiculous.  An explanation.  But she woke you up in the middle of the night to tell you that you just cheated in her  dream?  I'm like, but I was sleeping.  I was like, I'm right here.  She's like, no, I had a dream and something's up.  Well, great.  Well, in my dream, I was taking on the entire, all of the Nazis by myself and I won.  Yeah.  So how could I have been cheating?  Right.  I was in a tunnel.  I was in an underground tunnel.  You mean you were preaching to all the Nazis and then you guys won. 
[00:10:00]  Let's go to Pete in New York.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Oh, man.  My girlfriend had the same stupid dream and she said, I look nice.  So I come home, wake her up, you know, kiss her on the face and she instantly pissed  off.  Get away from me, she said.  I'm like, what?  What the hell is going on?  Well, you were cheating in my dream.  The entire...  That is hysterical.  And then also, that's your problem.  Like, what?  I tell you, women really think they have some, like, sixth instinct that if I dreamed it, 
[00:10:30]  it must be true.  My women instantly...  Wow, that must be it.  Yeah.  It is.  Womb power.  I think it's a womb power.  Like, you know, my woman thing told me.  The only reason I'm dreaming it is because something that you've done hit my subconscious.  Right.  And when I went to sleep, it manifested itself in the dream.  And as a woman...  Did it.  ...my womb tells me with the power of the womb...  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I was going to talk about this movie, The Bridge, which is amazing. 
[00:11:00]  And we're going to have the director in today.  And we're going to have one of the guys that jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and survived.  We got some great radio today.  But now we're on this weird tangent.  So we got to go with it.  The show that wasn't the call we took earlier, we hung up on?  I love you guys.  The guy that survived.  The guy that survived.  The guy that survived.  He's come to Bartista.  Mike and Jerry.  Mike.  Hey there, Mike.  Let's go.  You got to make it fast because the phones have exploded.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  A little more energy.  A little more energy.  We're faking the energy. 
[00:11:30]  We're just as tired as you guys that are calling this show.  But we get up for the program.  My ex-girlfriend once had a dream that she got pregnant and I gave her herbs to give her an abortion.  She ended up actually breaking up with me over it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Girlfriend dreamt I made her get abortion?  She dreamt that she got pregnant.  Right.  I gave her herbs.  I'm an amateur herbalist.  And I gave her herbs.  I gave her an abortion.  A herbalist?  Right.  Isn't it an herb, by the way? 
[00:12:00]  We like to call them herbs.  If you're a professional, call it an herb.  The H is silent.  It sure is.  And herb.  And you're in the business.  Herb is a name.  Herb is a thing.  A plant.  I'm a herbalologist.  I'm a herbalist.  A herbalist.  I know everything about herbs.  Hey, I could give you some of these herbs for the abortion.  Hey, Rhett, get some herbs.  All right, let's go to Stephen and Rod.  Great iced tea. 
[00:12:30]  Stephen.  Hey, Stephen.  My wife woke up the other morning scared endless of me because she dreamed that I had  bludgeoned her.  That's a good one.  She's asking me, did I change the life insurance policy?  All kinds of nonsense.  Wow.  They really put a lot of credence in these dreams.  Yeah, it was wild.  Take care, guys.  I take dreams for what they are.  I don't care what the hell happens.  Some dreams I wake up there are just horrific, like awful dreams. 
[00:13:00]  And some of them are a lot of fun.  And it's a crapshoot.  And then you wake up and you take it for what it is.  Sometimes, like, you feel a little creepy for a little while.  But it goes away because it's a dream.  It's not real life.  You ever dream and you wake up and you say to yourself, wow, I didn't realize that was  in my head.  Yeah, where did that come from?  I didn't know I was, you know, an expert on Russian literature.  Whoa.  You know, some bizarre thing.  But that happened.  I was a ninja.  Right. 
[00:13:30]  And, you know, I have a recurring dream and it's frightening as it's happening.  But I laugh every time I wake up because it recurs so many times.  It's sometime years ago, I had either helped people or had myself killed somebody.  Oh, God.  And I must have buried them or disposed of the body somehow and never even thought about  it.  And then the cops, I realized something happened where the cops now found this body and they're 
[00:14:00]  doing all kinds of forensics on it.  And they're kind of like, I know I go, oh, my God, I know I left something there.  There's like hair or I think I left like a piece of clothing or something.  And I know I'm going to I'm going to be in prison for the rest of my life.  Oh, my God.  I think that's a popular one.  They're going to get me.  And in your dream, they're starting to get suspicious.  And the cops are starting to look at you.  And you get a little paranoid like, why?  And then you wake up and go, oh, I'm out of trouble. 
[00:14:30]  How great is that?  When you wake up and go, oh, my God, I beat the rap.  I just had to wake up.  Start singing with the birds at that point.  There's that recurring one.  One other recurring one is something happens where bad guys, whatever type of bad guys are chasing you.  The blacks.  And it's not always usually usually actually white guys.  But I can't.  I have weapons. 
[00:15:00]  But either the bullets won't fit or go in the gun or you pull the trigger and it's too hard to pull or the bullet doesn't come out of the barrel right or something.  Keith.  Yeah, that's the one I get.  You get that one?  Well, it's a work related dream.  No.  Yeah.  I mean, for police officers, I'm sure they have that one all the time.  Yeah.  Like when all of a sudden you'll be chasing somebody and you turn the corner and they have a gun and you pull your gun out and you squeeze the trigger and like the slide doesn't go.  Oh.  You keep pulling it and pulling it and click and then the shot goes off from him and then you wake up and you're like, oh, got out of that one. 
[00:15:30]  Sweating.  Let me clean my pistol.  Yeah, that's the work dream.  Yeah.  It has that depending on what they do for a living.  Why do I have that dream?  That's not work related for me.  Well, you are Italian.  Who knows what you're doing when the show's over?  I have the dream where like I'm in a pretty dress.  My hair is beautiful, like feathered.  Aw.  Must be disappointing when you wake up and you're you.  Hey, it just goes on. 
[00:16:00]  I'm glad I'm not alone on this one.  Jimmy in Queens, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah, I was spilling with my girl when I sleep and, you know, she had a dream and she started hitting me and I didn't know what it was.  And I'm just like trying to go back to sleep.  Next thing I know, she elbows me so hard right in the nose.  I'm bleeding all over the place.  She's eating in a dream.  I'm talking gushing blood from my elbow.  And then she and she's still pissed off at me after all this. 
[00:16:30]  And I'm like, what did I do?  What did I do?  She's like, you were sleeping with her.  I know it.  I know it.  Two days she was pissed at me.  Two days.  Two days for a dream.  Wow.  Yeah, but you know we're all actually cheating.  So we're like freaking out like that.  They know.  You know he was actually cheating on his girl.  Yeah, he was cheating.  She was like, how'd you know?  How'd you know?  How'd you know?  Let's go to Luke in Jersey.  Luke.  This is Lou.  L-O-U.  Hey, Lou.  What's up, buddy?  Lou.  Frankas.  I can't do it. 
[00:17:00]  Jimmy's in San Francisco.  What's up, Luke?  I got a, uh, my girl had a dream.  You know the girl Cameron, the doctor in house?  Yeah, of course.  She had a dream that I was banging her.  And she saw me at a party with her.  And I was just totally mean to her, she said.  For three days, she wouldn't talk to me.  That's funny.  Totally mean.  You were mean to me.  What did I do?  You wouldn't talk to me.  Nothing.  But, but, wait, no, what did I do?  You were with some girl and I came up and you ignored me and said, it was a dream. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly, exactly.  And it says she didn't talk to you.  Funny.  She didn't talk to you for three days after that?  Three days.  She wouldn't take up her phone.  Yeah, yeah.  Sick bitch.  Psychos.  Uh, let's go to this one.  A couple more or then we'll move on.  Uh, Sam in Idaho.  Hi.  Yeah.  Idaho, Utah.  My wife, I, yeah, I know.  So, my wife had a dream that I was cheating on her with her twin sister and, uh, woke up 
[00:18:00]  just swinging and beating the crap out of me and I got out of bed, finally got out away  from her and out of bed and, uh, got her calmed down and the only thing I can do to explain  it away is just make a joke out of it and ask her if her sister was any good in the dream.  Well, that's, uh, that's a way to smooth it over.  Yeah, right on, man.  All right, let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Rob.  Hey, guys.  I live with my girlfriend.  She's an identical twin.  Woke up hysterical several times in the middle of the night that I'm sleeping with my identical 
[00:18:30]  twin sister.  Do you notice this little pattern here?  I guess girls that have a twin sister have this thing, probably a recurring dream that  their boyfriend or husband is sleeping with the sister because they probably had such competition  with each other their whole life that it just stays with them.  But if you're going to cheat, aren't you going to go out and find like a different  poo-ha?  No.  Why would you cheat with the same poo-ha?  You're hysterical. 
[00:19:00]  You know, I never even put it in that context where it's like, you're going to cheat.  You want a completely different girl, you might as well just stay with the girl you  with.  Bob, why would you...  Like, oh, God, I love the way you look.  Why would you put yourself through hell by sleeping with a twin sister?  The chick I'm with is a pig.  That's why I'm cheating with you, her twin.  You really did swing her around.  Every single part is exactly the same.  Why?  Unless, of course, with the twin, you're able to just look at the back of her head, if  you know what I mean. 
[00:19:30]  Maybe the twin's into other things.  That's why you're cheating.  I never even thought of it.  You're always like, twins, yeah.  Yeah.  I hope you just really put it into perspective.  Yeah.  Why are you going to want to do the same thing?  Just put a mirror in your room.  There, you were twins.  Now, if you're getting both at the same time, now that's different.  That's like time travel.  Different.  It's like time travel.  You can swing over here, and then she's over there, and then she's over there, and  then she's over here.  Zipping around the room.  How'd you get down there?  You're up here.  But I just saw you.  Major Nelson, you were just over. 
[00:20:00]  Let's go to Rich in Philly.  Rich.  Yo, guys.  Hey there, Rich.  You'd sleep with the other twin, just so you know you picked the right one.  Oh, is that it?  Maybe the other one's a little more freaky?  Yeah, but my ex-wife had a dream that there was a bug on the ceiling, woke up, and then  woke me up to squash this bug that wasn't there.  I'm running around 3 o'clock in the morning with no contacts in, looking for a bug that  doesn't exist.  Lunatic.  I should be able to hit them. 
[00:20:30]  They're recurring dreams that I have that are like location shots.  Like it's a set.  Yeah.  Like it's a certain house.  I'll always be in a certain house.  Certain car on a certain road.  It's always the same thing, same type of setting.  How do you know you dreamed that before, huh?  How do you know?  How do you know?  Because I remember.  How do you know you remember?  Why?  What are you saying?  Like I just dreamt it once, but my mind told me.  But your mind's saying, no, you've been dreaming this dream.  I'm thinking.  I remember.  I remember waking up and remembering it. 
[00:21:00]  How do you remember?  Because I remember.  All right.  Don't say remember again.  That word is sounding silly.  It's like Missouri.  Missouri.  Do you remember?  Oh, Missouri finally came back to normal, saying it.  Now, Jimmy brings us all the way around to make sure the girls stay paranoid.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Jim.  My ex-girlfriend had a dream one time.  She woke up all pissed off.  Listen, you know, I know you're cheating on me.  I said, really?  Well, what does the girl look like?  You know, because I was kind of curious.  I was doing good.  And she actually described the girl almost as if she was looking at the picture to the 
[00:21:30]  T that a girl that actually started fooling around with.  I told you.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, now you are going to get the girls going.  See?  We do have this.  Oh, boy.  Every girl.  We do have this.  Womb power.  Womb power.  My estrogen is magical.  Our brains are directly connected to our wombs.  Oh, boy.  It's like a cheating sonar in our bellies.  You look inside there.  There's a magic eight ball.  We'll shake it.  All right.  We got a girl's perspective. 
[00:22:00]  Signs point to cheater.  All right.  We got to move on because we're going to get a girl's perspective in one second.  But first, Brett at West Palm Beach.  Brett.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to call in.  I had a dream one time.  Oh, I haven't done that in a while.  Are you still there, bro?  I'm here.  Are you there?  Yeah, sorry.  I hung up on you, but I got your back.  Wow.  I haven't done that in a while.  Go ahead.  No, I had a dream one time.  I was in a fight, and I was wrestling with this guy, and the next thing I know, I'm getting 
[00:22:30]  elbowed in the ribs, and I wake up, and it's my wife, and she said, what the hell are you  doing?  I had her in a freaking chokehold.  Choking your wife.  Wow.  Great.  I love that.  I wonder how many people have actually killed their significant other because they were  dreaming.  That was a complete accident, but, you know.  Sleep terrors.  But the law doesn't look at it that way.  Have you heard of that?  Sleep terrors?  Night terrors, I've heard of.  Night terrors, yeah.  Sleep terrors.  Flip out.  Just like extreme nightmares or something, and they move around a lot. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Flip out.  Just jump out a window.  Jay Davis did that.  Jay Davis jumped out a window, jumped out a sliding glass door, went right out, flipped.  He's got scars all over his body.  Wow.  Night terrors.  Just wakes up and just runs through a window.  Let's go to Liz.  Horrid.  We got a chick's perspective here.  A lady's perspective.  Liz, New Jersey, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I hadn't dated for a while, and when I finally did hook up again, I was having sex with my 
[00:23:30]  new boyfriend in the middle of the night.  I was dreaming it, but I actually was, and I was dreaming that I was having sex with my  ex-boyfriend.  Oh, boy.  I was really having sex with my new boyfriend, and I was scared to death that he was going  to find out, and I opened my eyes, and I'm like, oh, my God, don't say the ex-boyfriend  name. 
[00:24:00]  Wow.  Wow is right.  Fantasizing.  Yeah.  In her dream.  Yay.  Wow.  Very good, Liz.  So she woke up, and the guy was actually having sex with her.  Yeah.  So he was diddling her while she was sleeping.  Well, it almost seems like she was initiating it somehow through her sleep, and then she was  still sleeping while they were having sex, and then would wake up.  He was initiating.  Let's be honest here.  He started groping or something. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  In the middle of the night, you wake up like, oh, look what I got.  All right.  Well, I got to do something with this.  She's sleeping.  Right?  Just reach over.  I don't get the night terrors or anything like that, but I'll wake up, and it's not  one of those wake up, like right when I wake up, I go, ah, ah.  But if I wake up, I'll open my eyes, and let's say my girlfriend is awake, and she's kind  of like looking at me, you know?  I'll look and go like, oh, okay.  My girlfriend's awake.  She's looking at me. 
[00:25:00]  Ah!  Like, there'll be this delay where I completely assess the situation.  I know what's going on, so it shouldn't bother me at all.  But just somebody looking at me right when I wake up will freak me out.  But it's not immediate, even.  It's like, I'll open my eyes a little, be looking, and then she even says, you were looking at  me for like 10 seconds.  I was smiling at you.  And then I'll just, ah!  And wake up real quick, go, oh, you scared the crap out of me. 
[00:25:30]  That's weird.  Called me a lunatic.  Yeah, we gotta take a break.  This leads to the movie I saw last night.  Yes.  I went off on a tangent, but the bridge.  That's why I was dreaming about walking.  Walking toward a bridge all night long.  What is it?  What's the bridge?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh.  Wait till you hear what these geniuses did.  Yeah.  All right, we gotta take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to Your Radio, the worst of Opie and Antony. 
[00:26:00]  We got the latest interview from Mike Tyson.  That's right.  It's in Maxim Magazine.  Should be on newsstands in a couple days here.  This guy hung out with Mike for 36 hours in Las Vegas.  Says, with the planet's most violent celebrity.  And there is just some funny things in this interview.  First of all, the interviewee was scared S-less.  He didn't know how to go about asking Tyson the really tough questions.  Because he was face to face with them.  Isn't that funny?  Whenever we do interviews, people don't care what the hell they ask us about.  Whether it might piss us off or something or make us defensive. 
[00:26:30]  I wonder what the difference is.  Right.  They look at us and go, my sister can beat you guys up.  It starts off pretty funny.  Because there you have Tyson and the guy that's going to interview Tyson.  And it says, sitting in a corner booth at H&H Barbecue, a greasy soul food joint in a mall off the Las Vegas Strip, Mike Tyson is snapping chicken bones with his thick, restless fingers, splintering the marrow into soft, tongue-moistened shards so it resembles linguine.  He has the eyes of an executioner. 
[00:27:00]  They've locked in on my own and they're spinning in their sockets like twisters.  That's a lunatic.  Holy mackerel.  Tyson's talking about prison.  The years he's done for rape and assault.  And I'm jabbing him with little questions, working nervously and methodically toward the bigger questions I want to ask him.  And someone asked the interview guy, what's it like asking Mike Tyson about sexual predators in prison? 
[00:27:30]  And the interviewer goes, complete terror.  I beat around the bush until he catches on.  The fighter shakes his head and growls.  You want to do this with Tyson?  Yeah, what did he say?  Listen, everyone's pathetic in there.  If you think you're tough, you're going to get effed up.  They're going to eff you.  They're going to cut you.  No one is what they appear to be.  You meet a guy and he's nice and funny.  Then you find out he killed a bunch of kids. 
[00:28:00]  Put them in a microwave.  He wants to put people in the microwave.  I like it.  You know, like movie popcorn.  You put them in the microwave.  Well, I have trouble with my microwave at home because of my gold two-faces.  I have to hit the button and run away because the radiation of the microwave makes my teeth spark.  My gold teeth, they start sparking and arcing because that's what microwaves do to metal objects. 
[00:28:30]  How do Mike know that?  I don't know, but I know it.  I know when my teeth start sparkling, like the 4th of July sparklers, I got to get away from the microwave.  We can't trick you, right, Mike?  You can't trick me.  You know everything.  That's right.  Popcorn.  P-A-P-C.  No, no, it's P-O-K.  Corn.  K-C.  See what?  I'll see me punch you in the face if you say Mike can't spell. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  So more on the interview.  Then he starts talking about his amazing house.  He lives in a 10-bedroom mansion with a gym, a guest house, and a wine cellar.  I need that because I don't want the woman I'm assaulting in one room to hear the other one that I have just assaulted because then they get a chance to run away.  And then Mike starts talking about his house, Mr. Tyson, if you will, from your interview.  I'm reshaping my house.  I've been working hard on turning it into a nice home. 
[00:29:30]  I like to do that stuff.  I read magazines like Architectural Digest and Decorating Digest.  I want to be an architect.  I like Architectural Digest.  It's a good publication.  And then I eat the cover and I eat the pages.  And the glue in Architectural Digest tastes much better than the glue in Decorating Digest.  I want to be an interior decorator, but I ain't a f***er. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  So then I am Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Then the guy interviewing Tyson, you know, finds out about his Bengal tigers.  He has four of them.  And it says in this article, we hope to see the fighters for Bengal tigers, but they're in Dallas with a trainer until Tyson finishes his renovations on his brand new house.  If they were here, you'd be so f***ing scared.  I think the guy was f***ing scared just being with Mike Tyson.  He's got tigers. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And he says leaning against the wall in his kitchen next to a row of air freshener cans.  When they stand up, they're like eight feet tall with heads as big as coffee tables.  They like to jump on you and break you down.  You'd get your ass kicked.  I introduced one to the newspaper guy one time and he had a heart attack.  It wasn't a good interview.  Hey, newspaper guy.  And then the guy goes, what does Tyson do with his tigers?  I punch him in the b***h and in their face. 
[00:31:00]  It's like punching a cement wall.  They like it.  I'm like Siegfried and Roy with our severe mental problems.  That's right.  You never see Siegfried and Roy, those two pussies, punching their tigers in the b***h.  They might punch each other in the b***h, but they like that.  It's like punching a cement wall.  He punches his tigers in the b***h. 
[00:31:30]  What are they going to do, eat me?  I'll bite that b***h.  I don't care.  Don, what's going on?  Yeah, man, I want to ask Mike, whatever happened to his megaphone?  Didn't we always...  Wasn't Mike Tyson, for some reason, always on the megaphone?  Yeah, that's because he used the megaphone in England that one time.  Oh, that's...  You know something?  I couldn't remember why Mike Tyson was always through a megaphone for no apparent reason.  He went to England and people were taunting him, so he grabbed the megaphone and started taunting him back. 
[00:32:00]  Through his hotel window.  I totally forgot about that.  And ever since, we did our...  My aunt did his Mike Tyson through the megaphone.  Shut up, you limey sons of bitches.  Look at your teefuses.  They look worse than mine.  You don't have good dental hygiene like Mike Tyson.  Look at my teeth.  T...  He punches them in. 
[00:32:30]  Who the hell would want to fight this guy?  The only reason I punched tigers in the...  Is because there ain't no Tyrannosaurus left on the earth.  They were extinct millions of years ago.  I believe it was due to the climate change.  How do Mike know this?  I don't know.  But I know.  I would love to fight a Velociraptor. 
[00:33:00]  I would punch him in the...  Nothing he could do about it.  All right, so it goes on.  And now Tyson talks about his Prozac.  Tyson is on Prozac.  Apparently, a lot of it...  Previously, the heavyweight had been taking the antidepressant Zoloft to control his mania,  winning off of it before his fights.  And then the famous quote, Anthony.  I got it right here.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  See, because I would just kill y'all. 
[00:33:30]  Actually, I wouldn't kill them right away.  First, I'd just walk down the street punching people in the...  Seeing if they're as tough as my tiger.  You should see how they have to give me the Prozac and the Zoloft.  Here's somebody getting me some Prozac.  That one was in the butt.  Now, I run around for a while.  And they got to chase me.  And then sometime they found me next to a bush out in my backyard.  And they put me in a cage and relocate Mike.  But Mike always finds his way home. 
[00:34:00]  Sometimes, I wake up and I got a radio collar on me.  And I scrape it off next to a tree.  And it falls off and they can't find Mike.  To give him more of his Zoloft.  Uh-oh.  Oh, that one...  Oh, I'm feeling a little woozy now.  Look at me.  I'm gorgeous.  Watch out.  I'm going into a death row.  Death.  Death?  That's what I said.  Death. 
[00:34:30]  I'll punch you to death.  Just watch.  First in the...  Just like my tigers.  Read this, Mr. Tyson, about the Zoloft and the Prozac.  I'm on it.  To keep me from killing you all.  Right.  I don't want to be on it.  But my doctors are concerned.  The fact that I'm a violent person.  Almost an animal.  Almost.  That's what it says in the magazine.  Did I say that?  Almost an animal.  I have three less hairs. 
[00:35:00]  I'm like Rob Schneider in The Animal.  Sometimes I'm such an animal, I punch myself in the...  To see how pissed I could get me.  And then I kick my own ass.  I'm taking bites out of my legs.  I'm crazy.  And then they start talking about how he wants to be a nice guy now.  I always want to be a nice guy.  But I get in fits of rage when they put the little biplanes around me and try to shoot me off a tall building.  No, that's not in the article, Mike. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm trying to be a nice guy.  Right.  I'm trying to get my life back on track.  I'm on the verge...  Of getting your life back to normal?  Yeah.  Okay, and then the interview guy goes, what do you mean, Mike?  Listen, I'm crazy.  Whoa!  I'm effing crazy.  But there's got to be some dignity about me.  I'm older now and don't want my kids to think I'm a total maniac.  I may be, but my children have problems with the teacher. 
[00:36:00]  I don't want them to...  Mike turns the page.  Be scared to come to me because I go down and kick the crap out of the teacher.  In the past, I would have.  Holy ass.  The kids have problems at school.  He goes down to the school.  Could you imagine that?  You're Mike Tyson's kid.  You have a problem with mathematics or something?  Why you give my son a D?  Well, he's not doing his work.  Okay, I'm going to punch you in the...  And I'm going to bite your ear off. 
[00:36:30]  In the past, I would have.  But Mike Tyson, it says, is full of love.  I love everybody.  I don't want to hurt no one's feelings.  I'm on the Zoloft to keep from hurting no one's feelings.  And from pulling organs out of your nose.  Because I would do that.  Mike, what do you have to say about your bald head?  Oh, wait.  There are more Prozac for Mike.  Oh, I'm feeling good now.  It takes the edge off.  He talks about ladies and how ladies love his bald head.  Why do they love your bald head, Mike? 
[00:37:00]  Girls love bald guys.  They like to rub your little head when you go...  Because the bald head on top looks like the other one.  Only without the gold doofuses.  He's insane.  What is this whole thing about being gay?  I know I ain't gay.  Are you gay, he asked me?  Nope.  Then it must be you, Mike. 
[00:37:30]  Wait, who is he talking to?  Who the hell am I talking to?  Wait, back up.  What the hell was he talking about here?  They say one of three guys is gay.  Mac jokes.  His hand resting on Tyson's shoulder.  I know I ain't gay.  Are you gay, he asked me?  Nope.  Then it must be you, Mike.  Oh, I guess it's one of Mike's friends, Mac.  Why don't you shut up?  I'll punch you.  All right, and then they go back to talking about prison, Anthony.  When you go to prison, your life is ruined. 
[00:38:00]  Tough or not, you learn how to play the game.  Right now, right this second, people are getting effed.  People are getting beaten and raped.  You've got to be one of those crazy mother effers to survive.  You've got to join the psychopaths club.  I'll join that one.  I'm a card-carrying member.  That's funny how I sit right now this second, people are getting effed and getting beaten and raped.  Because that's all just me.  That's all Mike Tyson.  Member of the psychopaths club. 
[00:38:30]  P-S-Y-C-H-O-P-A-T-H-S.  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  Watch them scream, I'm so mean.  I'm Mike Tyson.  All right, and then finally, Mr. Tyson.  You don't know when I'm effing you.  Let me tell you something.  There might be some prisoners years and years and years after they got out of the joint.  If the memory fades, they might forget that they were raped in prison.  And I remember it very vividly.  I'll come back to that one. 
[00:39:00]  All right, and finally, he was watching the Discovery Channel over here.  I love the Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  The other day I saw a show on Court TV.  There was this kid who got convicted of murder, a skinny, a Caucasian guy.  He got 20 years, and he thought it was going to be a good deal.  He had no idea his life is over.  they're gonna ask him i said to myself they're watching this right now and their mouths are

[00:46:00]  take a break okay one more shot more from the opian anthony show it's the opian anthony show  what's up with uh keith oberman you were saying something in the office there anthony well he's 
[00:46:30]  uh using the nazi salute on tv the uh anti-defamation league has sent uh keith uh a little email  a little letter on their little letterhead and uh they're a little annoyed at him using the  sig heil nazi salute nice when he's referencing bill o'reilly nice this started out at some um  one of these press things that they do and he was uh brought up to speak and he had a picture of 
[00:47:00]  bill o'reilly's face on a stick and he put it in front of his face and go on his uh bill o'reilly  rhetoric because these two have quite the rivalry going well bill o'reilly's just a babbling ass and  i'm glad someone's giving it to him on a nightly basis yeah o'reilly's a hypocrite he's just a  jackass he really is just not a nice person he's an awful person a miserable person i agree with you  both and i still i side with the ad on this one you do okay well we'll we'll discuss we'll discuss 
[00:47:30]  and then uh he put the stick up with the picture of the face and uh and did the uh nazi uh raise the  right hand point your fingers forward make keep it at a about a um 40 degree angle up on the  i won't get into all the details a little too much info so he's been he's been doing that you can't  see at home as his heels actually clicked under the desk as he did that the only way to do it with 
[00:48:00]  jack boots like this and when are you gonna grow out that mustache again well i like a clip nice close  to each nostril we actually saw a dude in new york with the freaking mustache i'm like are you nuts  he's trying to bring it back are you nuts trying to bring it back come on everything old is new  again so eventually that mustache come back we've all seen the little curly waxed mustache that's from  like the 1800s that made a little comeback for a while fu manchus come back everything comes back 
[00:48:30]  the little tiny soul patch maybe you do the the hitler with the soul patch and then maybe you can  get away with it slow down and then eventually you take uh the soul patch away and there you go  or maybe the hitter style with some big pork chop sideburns i just feel bad for the guy out there  that knows he looks really good with the hitler mustache does anyone look good in that mustache  can't he can't go with that look little charlie chaplin brought so much joy to our country years 
[00:49:00]  ago he had the same mustache mustache does anyone think hey you're wearing a charlie chaplin mustache  there is someone out there that knows they look much better with the hitler mustache and they can't  use it hitler trump we all on that mustache we all look at our faces guy what's gonna help this uh  mess got a little goatee maybe maybe i'll use sideburns a little long yeah maybe i'll do like  uh what do they call it the chin strap but somebody out there you think would look better with the  oh they know and they can't use it they can't use it it's been verboten you did no more no more 
[00:49:30]  can't can't wear it or else you look like some kind of a white supremacist or a nazi or just from  some facial hair all right so keith overman's doing the nazi salute yeah he's doing that and  apparently he's using it uh more than just that one time he's using it whenever he references bill  o'reilly uh who he you know and a lot of other people kind of attach a fascist name tag too  um so he received a letter from the adl the anti-defamation league dear mr oberman we are deeply 
[00:50:00]  dismayed by your ongoing use of the nazi sig heil salute both on your program and in public  appearances including uh the recent television critic association press tour while holding up a  max a mask of fox news commentator bill o'reilly while we understand that your arm uh your aim arm  i thought because he raised it is to entertain your audience by taking potshots at mr o'reilly 
[00:50:30]  your repeated use of the nazi salute has resulted in many complaints from our constituents uh including  holocaust survivors and their families who find the use of the gesture offensive and repugnant in  any context the nazi salute is more than just a remnant of history but serves as a calling card for  modern-day neo-nazis and white supremacists we believe that the use of gestures and imagery  associated with the nazis even in jest only serves to trivialize the holocaust and denigrate the memory of 
[00:51:00]  the six million jews and others who died as a result of hitler's final solution as a respected  and well-known media personality your actions have consequences and can set a standard for others to  emulate we are especially concerned that young people viewing your program might take their cues  from you your free use of the sig heil salute in light of these concerns we hope that you will  reconsider your use of the nazi salute in the future sincerely mel gibson no of course it's the anti-defamation league 
[00:51:30]  i just don't like the fact they reference kids like keith oberman is like really popular with with the kids  no one cares about it keith's just trying to be popular with anybody on that channel believe me i think  the guy's hysterical but uh you know the ratings aren't exactly through the roof over there and his show  was great the format very funny great i love it and i don't like o'reilly i think i think o'reilly  is a jerk o'reilly's a tool and i i personally i i uh read transcripts of a sexual harassment thing 
[00:52:00]  and i believed the woman yeah i i read what looked to me like transcripts and i completely believed her  yeah and i always thought that he uh had something he paid somebody to shut them out he settled out  with her filthy dirty to keep everybody quiet he settled out with some cash but yeah i i believe uh  taking both sides of the story my opinion was that uh she uh had a point there i absolutely felt  she was telling the truth uh just part of the hypocrisy that's o'reilly and this oberman thing 
[00:52:30]  uh the nazi salute yeah it's pretty harsh it's a rough one it is a rough one but i've always been  from the school of thought anything in in the proper context as comedy as dark comedy is okay i i if  keith oberman was walking around doing this to try to incite people into the life nazi lifestyle  white supremacists trying to get them on board that'd be one thing the guy's goofing on bill o'reilly 
[00:53:00]  who a lot of people call a fascist with the ultimate fascist salute uh i it it does offend people  obviously offends people greatly but you do have a freedom in this country to offend people  and and you know the this letter's fine it just voices their concern it doesn't threaten him  um but i think if he continues then the threats of boycott and other things will come but i see it as 
[00:53:30]  uh something he's using to really call o'reilly out and not incite uh white supremacists so what  does he do at this point does he continue doing it i don't know as i as he's getting a lot of  publicity today but uh does he just stop on his own is it good publicity and guaranteed o'reilly  is just gonna eat this up well i think he's dishonest i think he's trying to marry himself  to o'reilly kind of like that stupid alternative comic who was attacking larry the cable guy that  hostet guy or whatever because you're you're marrying yourself to someone who's so much bigger 
[00:54:00]  why do you do the nazi thing unless you're looking for attention you kind of do that um if your ratings  suck and the other guy's ratings are beating you and you want to like kind of attach yourself to  him because then eventually you pick up some of their ratings it's kind of how it works no i know  so uh i think that's probably part of his motive of course it's a motive you know that's that's the  bottom line he wants more viewers uh is this getting him in the news yeah it is he's just trying to get  under o'reilly skin yeah there's a general hatred there you know they're competing for the same audience 
[00:54:30]  and uh oh good for keith oberman man anything you do uh that's a little edgy and i'm not saying this  it's just a little edgy it's going to offend people where are kids going to do this they say  kid what are you there's two places you could do it getting a cab or in the classroom when you have  to go to the bathroom it's not like kids are walking around you know going like what do you have thing  you kind of do yeah you do putting your hand up in class a little more yeah you're going a little  higher straight up but hey matt in uh main what's up all right i think it's absolutely ridiculous that 
[00:55:00]  they are on his case about that because i have not in any years seen anybody do the nazi salute  and actually mean it no the only people that do you see them in the uh films of white supremacists  and there's like 10 jackasses standing around a campfire with some flags and and you know they're  doing it listening to the some hardcore uh uh skinhead music and just kind of doing the sig heil and it 
[00:55:30]  looks ridiculous if there was a symbol and there's no one moment uh or or thing that symbolizes slavery  but say there was one or say there was something that mimicked the the dragging guy uh death of the  black guy in texas by by the truck pickup truck do you think he would be continued doing that to mock  someone who he thought was racially insensitive like say uh o'reilly said something anti-black and  oberman wanted to mock that do you think he would be doing every time he mentioned his name  some shuck and jive slavery reference well i mean eventually you let me people call you out on it 
[00:56:00]  you got it you got to stop i think i think if you're a white guy and uh there's a black guy that  is uh really showing himself to be i don't know something i don't know what it is maybe you know  abrasive or uh like let's let's take uh jesse jackson with his hymie town reference years ago of course  that you could bring up and you could take that to an extreme in in the context of comedy and get  away with it as a white guy yeah i'm not talking about that don't really reverend al sharpton is 
[00:56:30]  another one they're both black though they can pretty much say whatever they want and get away  with it with political correctness but no but i'm saying reverend al could you as a white guy  you can goof on reverend al in ways that might come off as racist uh and offensive to black people  in general but in the context of comedy you get away with it you can get away with it because you  have the right to do it but you would get so i'm saying over but i'm saying as a talk show host  or whatever it is he does on television every night do you really think that that would continue  happening he might do it once but uh like say some kind of an uncle tom reference or whatever or 
[00:57:00]  some kind of like a a a sambo reference never it would never continue and this this is they have  the nazi thing is just so kind of uh universally known like people like ah whatever it's just a  stupid you ever see the whole problem with this is that was the worst explanation i've ever given  don't think i don't know my whole the wheels completely came off i was talking but anytime a  liberal thank you for just shutting me up as i was trying to explain no i know what you're saying  but go ahead make your brilliant point apologies poignancy coming folks pull over anytime a little 
[00:57:30]  i'm sorry no no that's okay i talked about you go ahead you would know anytime a liberal attacks a  conservative they call him a nazi they down you know whenever they don't agree with anything a  conservative says he's a nazi bush is a nazi for going into iraq they compare him to hitler all right  they just downplay the holocaust by saying every conservative is a nazi it's not the fact that he  raised his hand like that it's just that they're downplaying the holocaust they do they do they do  downplay i'm not quite sure what the holocaust is but i'm sure it's kind of the jews being killed um 
[00:58:00]  they you're right though they actually the it's a call for the left they always use like the ah he's a  nazi he's a nazi they always do kind of say that about uh yeah conservatives o'reilly is a douche if  you're just tuning it i don't like they break that word out but i think i i i can't see  why but you know i'm not jewish so you know who who am i to say who am i to say  but you can't it you can call someone a nazi if their ideology is leaning toward you know fascism 
[00:58:30]  why you can um and again no one's saying they should be constitutionally not allowed to do what  he wants to do but the zig heil every time you mention someone's name it's not like he said it one  time and passion like this guy's be hacky but you should have the freedom to do it to do it you  should but i understand you're on this one i agree with that yeah all right well we uh i don't like  any of that censorship stuff especially when it's on a comedic or satirical um level where where the 
[00:59:00]  guy is he's not out there on tv trying to rally the troops you know i agree with you but i just want  this one kind of agree with i understand why that's a little offensive every time he mentions it to do  all right why hacky now but i'm mentioning a rapist talk about someone else you know go after  someone who's committed a rape and then you know mime a punch in a rape movement this doesn't have  better ratings than him the problem all right let's move on we got rich voss in studio this is

[01:06:30]  it's the opian anthony show the one virus spreading across america  that last eight minutes could have been on the radio but we had to play commercials  pal talkers heard it we're trying to do something for xm we're still waiting for the equipment to  come in but we're going to do a thing where we start recording the stuff that happens during the  commercials and then playing that stuff back yeah because sometimes things happen oh my god it sucks  said we had to take a break there but patrice o'neal is in the middle of an amazing rant and 
[01:07:00]  a lot of people are saying that his rant is just like the rant i started with i'm talking about a  dumb parking lot he's talking about a relationship but it's pretty similar with uh trying to get a  threesome together and it is the same thing it's it's it's personal entitlement you feel entitled  but there's a difference man the difference is this all right here's obi's like hey i can't get in  this this this this this stadium this is making me sick it should not be like this i am angry about 
[01:07:30]  it all right obi what are you gonna do nothing but it should be better all right patrice i want to do  threesomes preferably have two girlfriends all right or basically one girlfriend and and we have  a girlfriend so your relationship has a girlfriend yes you and your chick your your girlfriend have a  girlfriend have a girlfriend all right that's what i want i am trying to make strides in doing that 
[01:08:00]  i am trying to make it happen because i think that you're trying to park closer to the stadium  that's all i say i want parking i want parking space he wants vip parking and your girl is at  every single aisle waving you further from the stadium and you're trying to explain to her that  you'll be happy if i'm closer to the stadium because i'll be happy because she's in the car with me and 
[01:08:30]  she's always going she's riding with me so my happiness is happiness man a woman's a woman's happiness  is not based on anything except for trying to figure out how to be happy so if i'm happy and  i have to cause her i have to bring happiness to her i have to be happy so that i'm in this in this  this mood all right well to give her this happiness to give her what she needs so how does this come into 
[01:09:00]  another girl dropping in having sex with you too that makes me super happy  and i'll have enough happiness to give two women now so you're using the reagan's trickle down  economics down man with with uh happiness trickle down man because a woman's happiness she just so  not she doesn't know like what makes her happy she just okay you women go from from place to place  specific to specific me when me and my girl argue i always try to argue the context is she even 
[01:09:30]  the entire thing but is is she allowed to argue with you absolutely it doesn't seem like it i got a  big patrice's world it seems like you shut your mouth and let me rule the whole place when i met her  when i met her yeah okay i i had a few women okay she asked me i think i told you she asked me  how did she end up being my girl and i said because you hung around you know because you 
[01:10:00]  stayed in there you hung in there and what is what it is it's like karate class and this is women  this relationship's a disaster oh man it's like karate class man it's like you meet look it would  you agree that men deal in numbers when it comes to relationships when we have we have to go find  women we we can't sit around and wait for women to come to us right we have to actively go  yeah you got to go seek and destroy it's like having a human resources department you may have  the secretary you need but she might leave your ass without two weeks notice and see you stuck with 
[01:10:30]  your company gonna go our business so what happens is when i met my girl i had six about five or six  girls that i had been by the way there's there's actually people out there saying you're full of ass  of course i had we know patrice for a long time he's no no no no he lives by uh different rules than  most people i know there's a few out there also saying i live just like patrice but in general  and the average guy is not getting away with what patrice is no no no is doing with his 
[01:11:00]  relationships and his life do you did you ever think that your girl your current girlfriend just  wants you and that's it she does but she's playing these little games to keep you happy hoping that  maybe someday you're gonna like give up on all this other crap and just settle down with her can i tell  you what my girlfriend is yeah i'm gonna tell you what she is all right she is a lesbian who is in love  with me she hates men but she loves me for whatever reason because i i was i i was the first 
[01:11:30]  dude to be into her without being sexual with her where she would hang out with me i'd give a guy  and she would go don't i look good in this and i'm like you look good but you you you do but i would  be honest but i i would be honest i would i would be honest with her uh-huh where other guys would  lie to her to sleep with her just to get just to sleep and she'd be like well why i'm a cool chick  i i do anything i'm down i don't play sex games with nobody but why did why is these dudes not 
[01:12:00]  making me their girl and i was telling her why and as i was doing that unfold she was falling in love  with me and i was just being frivolous so once i realized she was in love i added her to the karate  class and she happened to be after i flip everybody right and they go i'm getting out of this class by  the end of the thing there's two girls left and they're both black belts one loses and she's just  like out of here so now i have a black belt and she has a black belt in my crap because i can't feed  her so that's why i don't i don't cheat on her because if i go out and i go talk to some girl i just met 
[01:12:30]  and i give her white belt like lies hey baby some old easy white belt yellow belt yeah i come back to  my girl with white belt mentality i come back to her and she's i go but you know hiya and she goes  she kicks me in the face and goes i've never been able to kick you in your face that easy what you  doing talking to a white belt i gotta stay focused with her because she has a black belt in you and me  she knows i'm not like i was gonna say jive in her but i'm not playing games with her and she's not 
[01:13:00]  doing this for she's a soldier man i went to brazil with her she's not doing this for me  she is definitely getting enjoyment all right there's the answer i'm just asking okay now i  understand a little more about all right about your relationship but now that's brazil where you  know you're paying for things now hooker out there that likes me she she didn't like her i said are you  out of your mind you could have gave her a hundred dollars she would have took it you could have  smacked her around and made her and say yeah you like my man you're a whore smack upside the head 
[01:13:30]  she didn't think like what's this don't like stuff you're paying she did she just there was a chick  that just she was my play girlfriend out there yeah and she had more than just i want your money  she was like i want your money and i who's this and my girl's like who's this looking at you like  she'd like you like that so she's getting into a third world whores when they give her that vibe  but the ones the ones that don't give it that's all she wants is not to be challenged man and she 
[01:14:00]  won't be let me ask you're bringing another girlfriend yeah that's what's gonna happen let  me ask you i was just gonna say that now this other girl comes in your girl uh digs her because  she's a lesbian that's in love with you you love the situation because now you got the two chicks  but i got one you are well well let me just say okay you got one we have one and you have one  chick right yeah but she only gets two panties the other one gets four by your by your logic  by your logic oh i'm sorry by your logic you are so fantastic that this girl is going to have to 
[01:14:30]  fall in love with you because you are a master of women you will understand this girl you will start  treating her is the trickle down fall in love with you it can't be two queens anthony there's one queen  so are you gonna have them duke it out oh my girl death match my girl will guide her through  what'll happen is if we find us a girlfriend my girl will trickle down what i like to her i'm not  gonna have that much access so you're not even gonna it's gonna be all filtered through your chick 
[01:15:00]  your wants needs everything else filter through your chick filtered to your your to the new chick  yeah and that way you don't have much contact with her so she can't fall in love with you but she  will know to do your bidding through your real chick patrice's main girlfriend will be like the manager  and then the girl right a worker be and she can tell her what yeah yeah you and patrice can fire her  through that manager you're out of here you need a reality show man oh hell yeah your people should 
[01:15:30]  be freaking are they crazy not having patrice on a reality show they should be like you're pushing a  reality show patrice o'neal and and his chick that would be a reality show i watched i pitched it  because there's some honesty there i went to comedy central pitched it and my girl came to the thing  and they looked at me like she came in wow and looked at me like y'all would look at me you know  when i'm talking yeah and i'll go look i'll go look the show is going to be me guiding women right 
[01:16:00]  but i have a girlfriend and all i'm doing is trying to find a woman that might this could be my  girlfriend if i was looking for one go to vh1 i think go to vh1 or playboy playboy tv you can't  go to comedy central go to vh1 yeah because this is no joke this is just all right very serious so  this started with patrice saying that you didn't get much sleep because you had the argument with  your girlfriend because she found out you were talking to another girl but you were talking to 
[01:16:30]  this other girl to bring her as a new girlfriend but not as important as the main girlfriend she only  gets two pairs of panties your girlfriend that you love gets four she's always better so how did  it end we had the one of the best sessions we've ever had all right it ended she walked to the  bathroom limping she crawled to the bathroom we had one of the best sessions we've ever had  when she gets tired because i never get tired of arguing and she got tired and she's when she when i  when there's logic involved because she she feels how she feels and so she was just saying look i feel 
[01:17:00]  how i feel i'm i don't want you you know you hanging out the perception that this this some  other girl and oh and i look like a fool and this that and the third and then i'm like look it's not  gonna happen that my lot my logic was why would i why would i bring her it's too easy i'm just telling  her it's too easy to cheat it's too easy to cheat i'm not i'm not i'm and i'm i'm not a nice guy with  that particular situation yeah you know i'll get a little side but i got a girl that i'm i'm i don't 
[01:17:30]  want to hurt losing her is is is important enough but still i'm if i'm going to sacrifice the fact  that i like to go get strange you'd rather just have it all right on the table this is what i'm  going to do so i need this from you yes but i got lucky and found a soldier what the hell does she  see in you i'm a trooper man i don't what the hell does she see in you she is a free she's free man 
[01:18:00]  she's a she's a free woman she's a lesbian basically so she doesn't she doesn't like guys she but she  loves you she loves me why because you're honesty because i'm because you take care of her bills  because no one nice things like every other woman who falls in love with me i guide them i don't leave  them hanging all right i told her if we break up man some lucky man's gonna get a good woman  some of you dudes out there if i go if you break up with your girl i gotta get a maniac then i gotta 
[01:18:30]  fix all right now let's get back to now let's get back to what you said uh about vinnie fix you said  something else there that you don't kiss no one look man my girl is lovely vinnie's wife is lovely  everybody got lovely women man and after a few years that you cannot it's it's scientifically  impossible for you to kiss your science is being brought in i read a book yeah no it's scientifically  impossible to kiss your woman with that same i just met you passion if you've been with her for a few 
[01:19:00]  years so you gotta find ways to jack it up see you got a family vinnie which which kind of gives you  that obligatory kind of you know i'm a you're a dad you know you're a family man but you kiss your  mouth your wife like like you just met her don't lie vinnie well you understand with kids i can't  kiss her that often so you're wrong i when i get the kisser it's fun did you hear that did you hear  yeah because did you hear the roller skating he did well i have kids shut up vinnie you don't 
[01:19:30]  understand that because you said it's fun something disconnected in you you're not a normal human  being yeah that's why we love him we love you no we love the patrice go ahead vinnie no listen you're  not normal people don't like you when they meet you because you're not normal you're but you like  me vinnie i love you you like me why though when you met me you know why because it wasn't status quo  it's like you meet some some little intern in the elevator over at the viacom building hello how's  your morning how's it shut up it's six in the morning why why because you're you you are raping me 
[01:20:00]  with your niceness why is my bitterness in the morning so bad why is my bitterness love different  from your from your hey subjugate subjugate me with your fake how you doing i listen i don't i'm  you lost me somewhere no because you're saying because you want to go hello how are you there's  good morning and that's that's status quo but i met you and said look at you you're so you're saying  because i'm idiots and you go but but that's what kind of guy you really are vinnie you're a guy who 
[01:20:30]  who gives people you mess with people all the time and and and and you go wait a minute you had to  get used to the fact like that we didn't go through the social contract and i'm all i'm trying to do  this is what i'm trying to do opi i'm trying to eliminate the social filter and go from this is how i feel  to saying it and sometimes it still gets blocked and choked in to the contract but i just want to  come up and get an argument for me we relate on that level right i just want to get that what i 
[01:21:00]  feel like saying and if my girl asked me you know you just want to be be with two women and make them  two women your girlfriend i go yeah well yes that's how i feel all right wow you were asking me about the  dumb parking lot what's the solution so what's the solution to keeping like the passion going in a  relationship i think it's possible actually i really do you tell me uh so far i'm beyond happy  two years in so i mean no i you know so i'm not at that point i mean the vinnie's trying to say 
[01:21:30]  how many years 12 years 12 years later that it's exactly the same the kissing this is what i do  like the other day now look listen to him and watch watch this unravel all right you're gonna jump  over me because you're gonna say the other day i got up i sent my wife flowers just to send her  flowers that keeps her happy that makes her happy she's got the flowers why did you do that  because i love you that's why that's how that's pro you know you gotta court your wife all you have 
[01:22:00]  to do it ob you gotta court your wife you gotta look i take care of myself i keep myself in good  shape yeah that's how i keep it fresh you call it exactly it's easy to court your wife  seven million dollar house minnie wow you're really it's easy when you live in a house my god  you can ride around in the house you have a you have a roller coaster in your house minnie  wow you just happy you just gave all the guys out there a blueprint to keep uh their relationships  going give your wife flowers flowers you know that's hacky after a while i mean sure flowers are 
[01:22:30]  good but gotta do a little more than flowers it's not just flowers just give her a credit card  it's hard to spend the money you go fake and exactly that's what you do you can't get in a  relationship and get bored what happens vinnie right when when the money if the money was flat  man you got no guidance you gotta work you don't see you don't need guidance because you got you  you have enough money to to just that's that's the guidance you can buy her stuff you can send her  on her on her cruises you could do all that stuff but where's the guidance where's where's you have 
[01:23:00]  to constantly figure out ways to buy her new something oh thank you for a new this is a  diamond washing machine thank you the same thing four panties two panties you're buying you said  you gotta keep her happy i don't i don't keep it happy with buy i keep it happy with guidance  because you know what here's what it is once your girl and you don't think that's exciting for her  to train another broad you you're gonna mess up you're gonna lose that girl because you're trying 
[01:23:30]  to have two girlfriends you're gonna blow it off and and here's the reason here's the reason i'm not  gonna lose her because i'm trying to have two girlfriends i'm not trying to have one each you'll  get i'm trying to have two and then you'll need trying to have a girlfriend for his relationship  can i can i speak for patrice i think i know if he loses his girlfriend because she's not into the  girlfriend with another girlfriend thing right more four panties two panties so that yeah so the other  girlfriend's not as good as the main girlfriend and the main girlfriend leaves because all this 
[01:24:00]  and patrice's world is gonna go you know what she wasn't worthy of this anyway i'm back out there  the dojo opens back up that's right i'm back out there's another black belt in his mind he believes  this is how he wants to live and he also believes that he's gonna make it happen whether it's with  this one that he's currently with or with someone that's uh he hasn't even met yet so to answer your  question vinnie if he does lose that girlfriend he doesn't he doesn't care in the end oh i don't  think patrice he doesn't care in the end i don't think he cares at all you know what i don't think  he cares about anything but i do i i love my girl man she i love my girl i tell her look man i look i 
[01:24:30]  love my girl i watch too much maury povich right i love my yeah 90 because i need 10 to to think that  she is garbage meaning that she could cheat on me she could do something foul to me but i give  90 of my love i need 10 for me to function so i can look through my files and human resources  and get me some more secretaries get me some more candidates and it's not going to be easy 
[01:25:00]  but i'm going to supplement see that's your insurance policy my girlfriend fills up 90 of me  90 okay maybe 80 because i'm trying to muscle another chicken so she fills me up 80 that means  you figure if it was 10 women 10 women just go down it would take eight women eight women to fill  up the space sheet so i would actively go out and find eight women to fill the void but you love this  girl i love my girl let me ask you something you love her she comes to you tomorrow and says look 
[01:25:30]  patrice i love you too i can't have a girlfriend for our relationship i say fine and if you want to  talk to her i've said it to her i said sweetie last night i said look man you could let me tell you  what a trooper she is all right i said look and you think this is reverse psychology but then i said  look i don't want no trouble just uh we'll cancel this man i'm sorry i when i was out and she said  no no no no no no no i'm just saying she wants a piece of this girl she saw her she was a hot mama  little amazon six feet nice booty and patrice my girl has it all figured out you almost have this  puzzle figured out but there's some pieces that got to be put like rearranged is that it but

[01:31:00]  to you oh nothing why are you mad we just fought you know how it is you fight and it's just ugly  it gets ugly and you got rid of her it was mutual no i can't say it was mutual you're gonna come  crawling back to her no it's over good we're done now replay now how many women do you think  the void how many how much emptiness do you have now five women how tall am i there was how many  women do you think how many women do you think let me enjoy that one how many women do you think 
[01:31:30]  it's like a science project it will take to fill that void now i don't know let's say we started  last night three hundred dollars um no the chase of square girls you got to chase i completely get  that but 2 30 in the morning kind of hard to fight a square girl you got you got to get a circle  off craigslist so it was it was sexual emptiness no partial but no not no no that's not i can't even 
[01:32:00]  i won't knock her for that no that was more my thing actually no he doesn't want to trash either  so he's no i can't no that's not jimmy's thing yeah it was just jimmy's thing who are you do you  even know him no not trashing like this close oh in like a couple of weeks forget it yeah i can't  you know calling her awful things this is the ona virus spreading across america wxrk new york  92 3k rock it's the ob and anthony show  this is rich voss you might recognize me uh if you were on the train today you are listening to 
[01:32:30]  the worst of opie and anthony  hey how you doing it's the ona virus hope he's got his mouth full and we're all laughing here  man i it's it doesn't stop during the break uh patrice just keeps going on and on just with all  this knowledge and wisdom of relationships that is from the planet krypton because it does it's 
[01:33:00]  nothing that can work here on on earth if some reason i think it's our oxygen nitrogen atmosphere  that that just screws this whole plan of yours up maybe you got to go to like venus because  you are just talking fantasy world it can happen whatever you're talking about let me tell you  somebody out there living it but more than i want no whatever you're talking about is possible  it can happen but it's the the after effect the repercussions these things you're making it sound 
[01:33:30]  like you do this and then it follows up with this no you do this it's like all right we got to clear  out a spot here to build a house on so let me nuke it and then i'm going to build a house without  thinking it's going to be irradiated for 8 000 years you're like what it cleared the ground and now  it's clear when you look at it like that that's pretty funny you like your plan is good up until 
[01:34:00]  the repercussion point we're just after repercussions you're you're kind of assuming too much on you're  planning too much on what this girl that you're bringing in is going to be all about don't forget  one basic thing that i am not putting on her to know anything i am guiding right i am driving but  you're not going to get an empty vessel so what'll happen is she she has she has two choices  she she ride or she gets out that's what i was saying earlier well we asked a question during the 
[01:34:30]  break uh about your can we say go ahead man i don't know what you want to air or not it's fine  man but basically you're a girl i'm not gonna say a name you know i'm saying but she's she's a good  girl yeah basically a girl uh we asked if uh your girl's been with another dude and if that bothers you  and then you said what sweet i've seen her pop another dude yeah i've seen her with another guy 
[01:35:00]  we went to a swing joint and i was because of what i wanted to do i had to there was no logic it was  just been it would just been pure hypocritical to say you can't sleep with another dude i didn't  even want to put that in my head to say that so i said okay we're gonna do this and what happened  is the dude um what happens is when you're swapping you know when you're swinging you know you're going  he goes in with his girl and i go with my girl we go and we start with each other sex vibe going  and we kind of you know switch you know trade up switch up and and he was very uh gentle with 
[01:35:30]  my girl very she liked him no funny no strange fingers no weird action and she she she nailed him  like a soldier he was very good to him and i was very good to his girl  hey when you're in these situations all right now i'm thinking like what is he you just sitting 
[01:36:00]  standing there watching when they're in these situations and people look at you all damn that's  patrice o'neill from web junk do you get recognized in those situations whatever like most people that  watch i mean look most of the people my fans are more the fans of this show and my fans like from  hbo something web junk web junk people are like little kids and the teenagers yeah but a lot of  those college boys they crazy man and they just know me i'm honest man that's why i got web junk  it's like they just i'm i'm trying to be honest as honest as i can well you absolutely are i'll give 
[01:36:30]  you that much me out and i might have lied about something so i might you know i got this girls i did  that mush my heart couple when i was young and you just learn you live and you learn and my  it must have been a hell of a mushing what's wrong with some happiness it must have been a hell of a  mushing because you have gone like in a wacky direction patrice uh let's go to uh nothing  wrong with your happiness yeah let's go to jerry in connecticut jerry hey boys what's up hey is this 
[01:37:00]  my boy patrice hey man what's up man this guy's a trooper i was doing a black philip this is my boy  you know this guy he's my he's on my top eight never took him off because uh he's a so he's living  it tell him jerry listen boys i've been living i've been married for 10 years two kids and i got  a girlfriend living in the house for the last nine years there you go what nine years  you got a 10 000 square foot house you can't have another girl from there running around 
[01:37:30]  i think you might find her eventually who's that i keep seeing that girl  just a fleeting glimpse down a hallway somewhere along corridor this guy's a soldier man she live  upstairs like um the the what's the dude the thing from uh pulp fiction um the gimp the gimp  she upstairs they don't him and his wife i remember the whole thing his wife the girl and the wife have  a little thing going he doesn't care that they mess around you know why this works let me tell you why 
[01:38:00]  this works because jerry is like one step away from serial killer like it's gotta be he's a black  guy we don't serial kill well well let me i'm the mentality is that of a serial killer like how can  you say that because it's so out there he's got a kept woman in the attic now she's not kept they know  each other they hang out together they watch movies shopping together you're like you're like a  more panties and two you're like a mormon then then in the old days no he's happy happy very happy 
[01:38:30]  how did the fight happen in that house like in other words does you ever get like two girls they  ever argue with you the two team up double the bitching gotta well yeah but i straighten that out  that that comment i straighten that out why is that a serial killer man why it's just some kind of  weird mentality why no i i'm exactly exactly what patrice is saying is exactly the way it is it just  doesn't seem to i train both of them i train training it's this he's raising a good bitch 
[01:39:00]  he's raising his girl and you know what neither one of them would leave if i asked them to why did  you marry the one did you did you know the other one before you got married i did know her but we  weren't sexually involved and then after one year of marriage you got this girl moved into your house  well we had we started having sex first so probably two years or so in the house just you and her or  you her and the wife uh me and the wife were living together we started having sex with my girlfriend 
[01:39:30]  and then within two or three years she moved into the house delicious that's my plan too i just got a  house myself jerry it has a nice attic oh man oh man and does she come to you and say like i need  money for you know something or no we just clothes no we just started living together and i started  taking care of her i bought her new car i bought her what is the third what is the third person get  out of this that's what i don't get i can see what you get i can see i can see what the wife gets but 
[01:40:00]  the girl you know in the attic with the chain around her ankle what does she get it's a fulfillment  man that she's not gonna get he he's but he has enough guidance to to lead two women he can guide  these women to something that they that that verily verile feeling that they don't understand if you  ask them why they love jerry they won't be able to tell you because there's some kind of weird nature  happening you don't think she's waiting for the wife to like die or something yeah she's been 
[01:40:30]  slowly poisoning like like flowers in the attic she's been giving him arsenic in the cookies  he's a trooper why can't you understand that i'm trying to understand this i can't understand it  does this that you have kids yeah you have kids and you got kids what do they call her aunt what's her  name aunt whore aunt whore what jerry they just call her by her regular name and what are you how 
[01:41:00]  old are your kids um one's 11 and one is seven all right and what do they think about this relationship  what are they being told she's the nanny no it's perfectly normal to them they don't wait wait it's  perfectly normal how much do they know about this relationship they i've had my kids go oh is that  your new girlfriend when i have a girl come over the house who goes to back to school night yeah who  goes to the pta meeting that's all he cares about i can't understand he can't wrap his you do you do 
[01:41:30]  understand he can't wrap his arms around this and anyway man i'm sorry i left us i left us hanging  one of these days so who goes to laundry and uh if i bring flowers home who gets what yeah are there  are there shared duties dude do they and jerry's not a jerry doesn't it's not like hey baby and then  if they get out of line and smack him in the top of the chops i don't i never touch my girl i'm  threatening my girl man none of that man it's a guidance it's a thing it's it's tapping into  this thing where she's just looking at you man like look this is so sexy i've seen look i've seen 
[01:42:00]  tv shows about uh uh mormons and people that are into polygamy and stuff like that and the women  are always a little screwy in the head they which they i'm sorry they're like i'm sorry which woman  do you know that's not screwy in the head no in a different way i'm talking they're a little like  like way out there uh a little screwy in the head as far as like their their relationship with the man 
[01:42:30]  is very submissive very submissive and they have a relationship with each other like almost  sisterly and uh patrice isn't saying anything wrong he's like yeah and this is great so they're not  actual they're not real women they're they're they're puppets they're they're stepford wives  why why because it's two of them so if he yeah because he did the same thing you're not getting 
[01:43:00]  a loving relationship from are you loving jerry all right he's he's on hold because i wanted to go to  joe you're not getting a real loving relationship you're getting sex from two different women how do  you know what you're getting have you ever done it how do i know wait a minute anthony have you ever  done it you was now i pay through the nose every three months because of it why do you think i got  divorced i'm saying but did you experience any of this action with your old wife did you find out 
[01:43:30]  didn't i just explain everything do you think i'm talking out my ass about this whole thing i am so  experienced that of course i did all right i know everything what happened what happened i write  huge checks every three months you got divorced because of a threesome i was part of it that was  the straw that broke that was the straw that broke the camel's back there was a lot going on joe in 
[01:44:00]  jersey that was the one where when the questioning came about in the courtroom and i would watch the  news and the post reporters there i said let's go in the back and settle this immediately uh joe what's  up uh i just want to say patrice sounds exactly like every cult leader i've ever heard cult leader  that's what i'm sorry i said serial killer i meant cult leader that is absolute bravo sir  cult leader you're a cult leader he's got nothing to say he's been found out look at him wow 
[01:44:30]  that's right he's proud of that though because once he once he once he swings two do you think  it's going to stop the hunt is going to go go like stop there he's going to then go you know if i could  get three girls and i got some poison kool-aid waiting for a hole right now the fbi is going to be  lobbing grenades through your window no they're not they're going to be joining me for dinner come on  in come on come on in lieutenant have a little piece they seem to be hoarding weapons he's hoarding  bitches is there a law against this officer put that down come on let's go to edward in queens 
[01:45:00]  edward you want to have her over there go ahead edward parking lot y i can't believe it good morning  yeah it all started with parking lot y by the way let's let's remember that fair enough all right  edward what's up yeah what's up gentlemen what's up man yo patrice um i've been married for about  nearly six years now i love this woman to death but i want to get away from her now yeah and you  know and you know what i want will keep you from not getting because you don't you're not 
[01:45:30]  sexually like explosive towards her no more and so now you're figuring that it's it's getting bad  because you're not sexually feeling the way you used to that's because innately we need look god  don't make mistakes there's five or ten women born to every one guy because god knows we will sleep  with five or ten women to keep this world going all you got to do man is talk to her and say look  i just need here's what you go to a swing club go to la trapeze man right and let me tell you  what it'll do what's that it's i don't know where it is but it's you just look it up it's very it's 
[01:46:00]  not one of those it's not one of those things where you knock and say joe sent me you can go in  and here's the thing dude let me tell you what you need to do you need to watch another guy  want your woman and you will be excited again and she needs to watch another woman want you and y'all  will want each other again it will be it'll last a extra five more years of excitement because y'all  because you're living this this married life of what you're supposed to be living if you go out 
[01:46:30]  and you find strange guys that want to pop your wife that can't be done once i want to that can't  be done like you're talking about one extreme right right can't that be done looking real good  walking around and guys look at her no no because it's going to be filtered from the other guys  you got to take her someplace where the protocol is some dude in a towel and uh and his and his  chick with her breasts hanging out say listen let's your girl is gorgeous and you go yours is too 
[01:47:00]  and y'all go in a room and you watch some other dude want your woman well it's a little further than  want he's getting hey well what are you gonna do can't have everything and i'm telling you that'll  spark y'all up dude i'm telling you jesus no i'm not lying to you man i'm telling you we're talking  animal stuff here we're not talking let's get socially let's let's been here taking notes over  there or what i'm listening all right let's clear our minds socially man let's just clear the social 
[01:47:30]  contract let's talk about animal let's talk about what you feel man i don't know what you feel but  whatever you feel you you you just aren't into her and you know you're a good guy and you love her  but you're questioning yourself you're going why you know what i'm gonna tell you why i feel like  this now because for the last month it's just been beefing beefing beefing and last week we got into  a fight so bad that i locked out the house and she had me committed for the night you're done dude  get it get out of it it's over don't get out of it this is your fault dude because it's your fault 
[01:48:00]  because that's what they do you have to guide them you have to let them know anything crazy she does  you have to dismiss it with logic man you have to beat it down with logic i'm telling you man  your your your marriage isn't over she's she's got something where girls get a little like i need  excitement let me tell you something any emotion is an emotion for a woman hatred is the same thing  as love for them if a girl hates me i know i can get her because i'll slip it over it's yin and yang

[01:49:00]  to become someone else's wife and i don't mean just i do she has to know what makes you mad what makes  you happy and she has to care about what makes you mad and what makes you happy his wife doesn't care  because she thinks he doesn't care so she's doing dumb stuff for drama to get attention and that's your  fault because you started off like that if you're going backwards it's hard to turn around man but now  you got to start turning around and you got to take a l patrice wants every guy out there to be a

[02:00:30]  oh okay i'll give you another hint what movie is that from is it the story of a guy who dropped  by just to talk a little bit no subjected to abuse but no one cares because that's what the show is  all about is it from that movie because i hear that's playing theaters this fall michael mann's  directing it cluny's in it everyone's going crazy well that movie plays every day that movie plays every  day here at that other movie also this see if there's a famous sound from that movie 
[02:01:00]  you can't remember that give me the horn sound again my number one  caddy shack  ah hey but his whole place sucks that's right it sucks remember that are you in all week uh mr dvd  because we might run out of time with you i'm uh i'm staying in the new york area for as long as  you like to subject me to scorn oh or we could talk about some terrific films coming out soon 
[02:01:30]  on dvd like that okay what's coming out that's what i want to hear let's uh let's try what's  coming out dvd reviews here plenty of stuff coming out uh next week this week is kind of doggy uh you  got uh the big movie this week would be america's sweethearts with julian roberts  there are some deleted scenes on it and one only well they should be a little more christopher walken  because yeah you need that in your movie oh wait wait now that was it oh hey mr dvd now it's mine  are you bop you're doing impressions a little walk in a little walk you gotta do some talking like 
[02:02:00]  walken because he's crazy and it's very good you know all the kids love it look at any other you  watch a lot of dvds you do any other impressions of some of the stars you see in the dvds you know  the thing is is that you know when i write for work i totally get my nerd on you know it's like  exactly oh narrative you know cinematography and then you know you start talking like sean  connery and the whole thing goes right to hell so you know it is no good no it's a contradiction  can you do sean connery for us a little bit certainly i could do that for your single ping 
[02:02:30]  that's right when cortez reached the new world he burned the ships so his men would be properly  motivated that's more than one ping fast yeah yeah that's kind of a mini ping ping pong  it's the opie and anthony show 92.3 k rock hey this is patrice o'neill you are listening to the  worst of opie and anthony i guess which is their best really and you know you think about it because i 
[02:03:00]  do have a serious question for uh mr dvd what's coming out next week well the shrek dvd that came  out and it's selling like gangbusters 2.5 million and uh and it's uh it has like two discs and stuff  and uh you know anything special on there there's a couple things on the second disc there's a little  musical note over the uh all the characters in the lineup  are these campfire tails now should i be making some s'mores all right you highlight a musical note 
[02:03:30]  and it brings up a six minute long musical montage are you happy no it's a hidden feature oh a lot of  what happens because i was laughing too hard at the crickets no i'm serious what what is it it's a  musical note what you know i gotta see both your hands because they're gonna bring up a farting  okay okay there's a musical note on the main menu of a second disc and you highlight that musical  note with your remote hit enter and there's like a six to eight minute long no no musical sequence 
[02:04:00]  mark shut up i'm answering a question i was asked i know yes i like there's another wacky uh it's sort  of a redo of a credit so six to eight musical sequence so that yeah that's on shrek lots of  technical stuff commentary from filmmakers what's coming out next week  uh two disc set for planet of the apes and uh what'd you think of that the actual movie  yeah there's two things that are wrong with that movie but one is that mark walberg is too  passive an actor to be pulling a plow on a summer blockbuster you look at you look at a good mark 
[02:04:30]  walberg movies like boogie nights rock star even the yards he's a reactive actor he's a guy who like  you know responds to stuff instead of causing it the other thing is that the ape characters are all  better developed than the human characters and that's totally tim burton because ah tim burton's  all about oh god bless you you plucky little outsider we're gonna write for you what's your  favorite dvd mr dvd and why uh there's a bunch of them uh everything from a great two disc set of 
[02:05:00]  boogie nights to uh the pixar films bugs life toy story ah yes those are the best possible dvd  pictures you're gonna see because there's no film and i thought i told you to shut up and that's  okay too why are you turning red mr dvd all right because you know we're showing some love here i i  hear you i hear you you know it's like it's all it's all friendly joshing joshing yes joshing okay  just joshing don't worry about you will not get any fart noise also out on this next week next week 
[02:05:30]  uh the grinch oh yes you like the grinch the christmas you don't like the grinch i kind of  like the grinch the only reason for ron howard to remake the original animated the grinch is because  that one wasn't making him millions of dollars it's like okay i'm gonna go out cut a big fat check  yeah and uh and just pretty much remake a movie that doesn't need to be remade also out next week  uh the uh dvd of apocalypse now redo ah that i want to say that's something we all got footage 
[02:06:00]  53 extra minute 53 extra minutes and how long originally was that so oh well over you know  close to three so things gigantic you know that's bring a lunch stay for the day but that's what we're  seeing you know we haven't asked him about um the godfather dvds that came out oh yeah have you seen  those yet no what kind of extras i hear the i hear the extras are unbelievable you get a full disc of  extras and a lot of that stuff has been around for years on the laser disc box and what have you but  you see things like wish somebody put this retard out of his misery uh well uh let's go to the 
[02:06:30]  phones the phones are lit here let's uh start with doug doug from springfield what's up i don't like  this is a gentleman if you ever saw the dvd don't let the door hit your ass on the way out  stop it is that a western is that what i've never heard of that movie what genre would that be there  doug genre a guy uh not making any sense on the radio he's making perfect sense that's all that's a  double feature with the guy with a short attention span calling in to complain about stuff  oh there you go oh touché mr dvd's got some chops to him a little touché for you wow look at all the 
[02:07:00]  uh normal radio stations you've been on before yeah exactly you know uh it's a whole list of them  anthony uh-oh comes highly recommended here all right what else uh what else can we look for now  uh a lot of stuff uh the godfather discs of course uh citizen kane is very good but there's a lot of  other uh you know more slam bang stuff i like stuff with a lot of extras i like the extras on 
[02:07:30]  my good extras coming soon coming soon is a two a free disc set of almost famous with the director's  cut and 12 tracks of music by the fictional band in the movie uh-oh all right that's not if you're  into that that's gotta be god awful well you know it's sort of like might be into that it's  like warmed over rock but it'll be interesting to see the actual director's cut right of almost  famous so that's coming soon with lots i hate seeing the deleted scenes uh on these dvds because  most of them suck that's why they're yeah and there's a reason why they were deleted that's 
[02:08:00]  pretty much why we were deleted is there any dvds out there where the deleted scenes are actually  really good and there was a reason they caught them there's a couple ones uh the film go  uh jay moore jay moore sarah paulie you know pal jay jay he's that gay actor jay moore yeah i  believe so yeah yeah i heard that on this station and uh but uh oh you listen to us yeah you know  when you watch the uh you should brought you gotta he's a he's pretty smart i know his cat uh on go

[02:09:00]  crazy talk and they're calling radio show okay now while you're laughing on the dvd of go you can  witness how hello hello this thing on hello would you stop it you can witness how they completely  change the ending of that film ah all right in the deleted scenes answering a question we could 
[02:09:30]  have done like 20 seconds ago right yeah if it hadn't been all right i like the alternate endings  i remember what was that one with the uh stockbrokers there oh the room yeah yeah boiler room that was  pretty cool the alternate ending that was a great alternate where giovanni ribisi plays the retarded  stockbroker instead of a retarded soldier the retarded uh the guy the guy in the gift who's like the  hick from hell right yeah you know yeah my daddy done told me uh he always plays a slow gentleman  yes he's not he's not a sharp he's not the sharpest guy but always very entertaining to watch 
[02:10:00]  uh the film final destination on dvd this is a really mediocre film yeah right but the thing is  that a dvd can't make a bad film good but it can make a bad film interesting and uh on final  destination get a half hour long documentary about how they test market films how they change the  ending the film that kind of the director of a writer of a marketing executive that sounds a  little like this segment i don't know kind of hmm kind of thing what do you mean i'm just thinking 
[02:10:30]  it doesn't sound like you know kind of i'm thinking the mr dvd uh i know no i am too i'm just saying  it's kind of you know i don't know about marketing of films well i mean it all depends i mean if you're  just gonna watch a movie on home uh you know dvd is the way to go oh yeah i hate videos now i don't  like rewinding yeah uh i like being able to uh just go to certain segments of it not have to  forward and rewind and stuff sure yeah i like the dvd i pretty much use my vcr as a paperweight
