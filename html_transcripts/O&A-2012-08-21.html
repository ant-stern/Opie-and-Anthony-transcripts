<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a dissection of past guests and interns who had lied on the air.  Rob, an intern, was exposed for fabricating a story about a canceled party; Tucker Max was labeled a "fraud" and "asshole" for failing a lie detector test related to an assault claim, which also involved vomiting and a broken camcorder; Ian Halperin's tall tales, including fabricated stories about "goddesses," were recounted; intern Adam from Michigan was called out for lying about meeting Sylvester Stallone (a coincidental Sylvester Stallone call to K-Rock was mentioned while Victoria Zdrock was in studio); and intern Piers’ invented "m'dickin' cider" bit was highlighted.  The hosts also criticized overused radio bits like "War of the Roses," mocking a poorly acted live reenactment of the bit prompted by a listener's story about a suspicious third phone on her bill.  Tangents included a valedictorian who lost her diploma for using the word "hell" and discussions of pornographic films and actresses.  The segment ended with speculation on why Warren Sapp hadn't returned to the show.

The next major segment focused on Augusta National Golf Club admitting its first female members, Condoleezza Rice and Darla Moore.  The hosts and callers largely expressed negative opinions, worrying about the disruption to the traditionally male environment.  Concerns about the pace of play, increased harassment complaints, and speculation about the reasons behind the decision (pressure from sponsors like IBM or media outlets) were discussed.  This segment included repurposed Andrew Dice Clay audio filled with highly offensive and misogynistic comments towards women, and further discussion of Lacey Underall from *Caddyshack*, Hootie Johnson, and Ant's experiences with Apple stock options (ultimately breaking even after initially panicking and selling).

The show then shifted to a discussion of stock options, specifically leveraging Apple stock options, and transitioned to a discussion of the recently deceased Phyllis Diller.  This segment included playing audio clips of Diller’s Ed Sullivan Show appearances, showcasing her often crude humor.  The hosts debated the quality of her comedy, with guest Troy Kwan revealing a connection to Diller through a Bloodhound Gang song.  Another guest’s impressive hair was also remarked upon. The conversation then moved to the "Video Time Machine" app, focusing on awkward clips from *The Brady Bunch Variety Hour*.  The segment ended with a Sirius XM On Demand commercial and mentions of upcoming appearances.  Vulgar and offensive language was frequent throughout this section.

The final segment began with a critical discussion of *The Lorax*, calling Dr. Seuss "overrated."  This transitioned to a tribute to the deceased radio voice George Taylor Morris, followed by a Bruce Kelly-created "interlocular" featuring Bob Kelly and his jokes, including one about sex with a sink. A phone call with Bill Burr followed, focusing on a false gossip column about a relationship with Sandra Bullock, Burr's Netflix special, *You People Are All the Same*, and his *Breaking Bad* appearances.  Jim Norton then discussed his feelings of irrelevance in his comedy career, recounted a story about being recognized after a long absence, and briefly touched upon M. Night Shyamalan and the Alan Sniffen New York Radio Message Board.  A short iPhone hockey game review and a mention of Norton's doctor's appointment concluded the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road  morning  seems like only hours ago we were doing this  what happened?  it was  so anyway, Rob's fucking party  I like the Rob Day  it was Rob's day yesterday  it really was  it half day  Are you looking at him a little differently today? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, it felt a little weird even saying hi to him this morning.  It kind of creeps out.  Usually he comes in and I'm like, hey, what's up?  When is his internship over?  Not soon enough.  A little creeped out.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Trying to be cool, but a little creeped out.  Just a little odd.  A little off.  Yep.  Doesn't smell right.  Nope.  Like milk that you go, eh, maybe.  Eh.  I still don't know what that was about.  I still don't know what that was about. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  But that's okay.  We're not going to waste your time with that anymore.  Not today.  But we are going to put together a weekend of programming of liars.  Just liars.  Liar, liar.  E-Rock, are we adding to the list?  I know we got the famous eyepatch kid.  I know now we got Rob where we can cut that up all nice.  Yeah.  Because it might have went a little long yesterday, but when we redo it for a weekend special,  so we'll cut it up nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We also have that douche, Tucker Max. 
[00:01:30]  Max Tucker.  Max.  What an asshole.  Yeah.  Tucker Max.  What an asshole.  But he still writes books and does very well.  I don't know how that works.  He's a fucking fraud.  He's wild, that guy.  He's a fucking fraud.  He's a crazy person.  Who else?  He's a crazy person.  We had an intern that we had him do a lie detector test over in the production studio.  We did?  Yeah.  Wasn't he telling the truth, though?  About being assaulted.  Yeah, I remember him.  Yeah, I think he was telling the truth, but we didn't believe him anyway. 
[00:02:00]  Derek.  Yeah, we can add Derek to you.  Yeah, I remember people.  Skinny dude?  Okay.  Yeah, I think it's Derek.  And then...  TuckerMax.com.  Don't go there.  Look at him.  He's with a lady.  Oh, look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  And everyone was puking, and the tape broke, and...  Shut up.  The tape broke?  Really?  What happened?  The tape fell out of the camcorder?  Well, his friend came...  Because it was falling out of the...  What?  Falling out of the closet, puking, and dropped the camera, and it broke, and they were all 
[00:02:30]  puking.  Shut up.  Because why?  He was fucking the girl when she shit or something.  When she shit.  And that made him puke.  Puking.  And then it made the guy in the closet that was secretly taping fall.  Oh, it's crazy.  We were so embarrassed for the guy.  We all liked him until that one moment.  There's something he said that turned all of us against him at the same time.  Like, oh, dude.  And we started looking around the room like, oh, this is uncomfortable now.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  At first, it was even like, even if we were thinking he was bullshitting, it was kind of 
[00:03:00]  like, all right, I could go with this, whatever.  But it got so ridiculous that we couldn't, in good conscience, just sit here while he  lied like that.  And the sad part.  He became insulting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the sad part, he leaves here and he becomes, you know, a Times bestseller.  Yeah, yeah.  For fucking lying.  For being a fraud.  I'll write a book like that.  Anyone can write a book like that.  It's full of bullshit.  Well, why don't you do it, then?  Yeah, I'm lazy.  I'm lazy, fuck.  I wouldn't mind if he had said, like, hey, these are just some silly stories I wrote. 
[00:03:30]  Like, I, because, you know, I'm sure his writing is good.  Right.  But when you come in and sell it, like, dude, this really, it's like, you're just insulting  us, and then we look like idiots by not going, dude, that's just not what happened.  I don't believe you.  I'm a betting man, and I lose a lot of bets.  But I would bet that most of those stories are complete lies.  Yeah.  Based on maybe slight truths.  I think.  Slight truths.  If he was telling the story and, like, getting all psyched, but then, at the same time, looking  at us, putting a smirk on his face and making that universal sign of the jerk-off.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  Like, man, this is fucking bullshit.  I'd have been like, oh, okay, we'll go.  All right.  Sell a few books.  Then what happened?  We don't know you anyway.  Fucking alien came in the room.  Right.  Yeah.  But the best was the camcorder fell out of his hands, and that made the tape fall out  and break.  And it broke.  Or got twisted, or?  Well, even if the VHS, which it was at the time, he said, even if that broke, there would  be a way to salvage the tape.  Of course.  And if it's something that crazy...  Of course.  ...you would fucking make sure you fix that tape.  Well, the reason was, we weren't buying any shit, so we're like, well, where's the video? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, well, I don't have that anymore.  And then he just started building the lie about how the tape broke.  Well, I don't know where it is.  How do you not know?  Wouldn't you keep it?  Well, I think my friend...  Well, where's your friend?  No, it broke.  Oh, did it?  Yeah.  Did it break?  I watched that video online recently.  That one's out there somewhere.  But you've got to see his eyes.  Beesh.  That he has to leave all uncomfortable.  Oh, he was not a happy person when he left.  That we're all very happy.  Yes, we were happy. 
[00:05:00]  That we exposed him for his lies.  He was happy.  In my humble opinion, we exposed him for his lies.  Yeah.  That was the old studio, you know, the big, nice studio.  Oh, that studio was great.  But anyway, that'll be part of the Lying Weekend.  E-Rock.  Why not?  And also Ian Halperin with his goddesses.  Ian Halperin.  Oh, right.  Liar, liar, pants on fire with Ian Halperin.  He came in with these girls that he hired to make believe that they were partying with  him all night.  Right, remember that?  And they just gave him up.  They're like, we don't even know this guy. 
[00:05:30]  We don't know him.  Who is he?  What?  I remember...  I love Ian Halperin, by the way.  He's one of my favorites.  And we got one of them on the phone, like, the Monday after.  Yeah, yeah.  We met him.  He paid us.  He paid us to be there.  Ian Halperin's the best, because he's never admitted that he's lying.  No.  Like, he refuses.  He still, to this day, insists that he was telling the truth.  His highness had his goddesses with him.  Yeah, sure.  And he didn't even pay him to have sex, just to show up and hang out.  All his lies are weird, too, because he brought in that guy with the French accent one time, 
[00:06:00]  and then Troy said that they were in the bathroom, and the guy didn't have a French accent.  How do you not love him?  See the difference, though?  You've got to love him.  He's just a performer.  He's a showman.  Ian's a showman.  Max Tucker's a douche.  Ian Halperin with his lies, you've got to love it.  Hilarious.  You've got to love it.  There is a difference.  And he's got, you know, whatever his music cues are, the fake saxophone.  He's like, oh, you don't believe me?  I can play the saxophone.  Let me play the saxophone.  Oh, you don't think he plays the saxophone?  He does.  I actually saw him do it live. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, really?  After showing you that movie, Ian actually plays the saxophone.  Oh, really?  I went to that showing, I think it was the Jackson thing he was doing.  The world premiere?  Yeah.  That was, what, in a basement somewhere?  Yeah.  Who did I go there with?  Did I go there with a girlfriend?  I might have gone there.  But he was playing, and he was actually really good.  Can we have him on today?  I love the guy.  He's the best.  You want to?  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's do it.  Come on.  We got nothing.  Just joking.  I'm going to book him for you.  Oh, boy.  Didn't we also have an intern who lied about, like, meeting Sylvester Stallone and posting 
[00:07:00]  stuff on his Facebook?  Oh, my God.  Remember the kid from Michigan?  Adam.  Adam from Michigan?  Yes.  I remember Adam from Michigan.  He was a real creep.  He was crazy, too.  That was scary, right?  Yeah.  What was his deal again?  Wasn't there a porn?  Was it Victoria's Zdrock in studio for the first time when that was talked about?  Yeah, she was in there for something.  She was just promoting a book, and she was there talking.  I remember her commenting on him.  That might have been her first or second appearance. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, I think he left his email open or something.  Yeah, he had some email where he was describing you guys as the, quote, talent, and he was telling  one of his professors that he, like, talked to Sylvester Stallone, even though it had  been a phoner, not an in-studio, and he hadn't been on the phones.  I've got to tell you something.  Wait, we talked to Sylvester Stallone once?  I did, yeah.  I never remember these people.  At K-Rock.  Patrice was in studio.  Yeah.  I never remember these people.  Oh, yeah, I remember.  Wow.  Was I out that day?  I think I was out for the Sylvester Stallone call.  That semester.  You might have been, yeah.  I think I was.  You must have been. 
[00:08:00]  Yes, I remember kind of hearing about, and I wasn't in.  Yeah.  Wow, we talked to Sylvester Stallone.  That's cool.  Dude.  I totally forgot until today.  Yeah.  So, and then the kid made believe he was talking to him and met him?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he sent somebody an email saying, like, oh, yeah, it's great.  I met Sylvester Stallone.  I shook his hand.  I got him coffee.  Oh, boy.  And then he came in studio, and you guys started questioning, and he just started lying and  lying and lying.  What ghouls.  What ghouls we know.  We should definitely include that.  Yeah, let's do a lying weekend.  When are we going to do it? 
[00:08:30]  When do we have a slot?  I don't know.  We could do it this weekend if you want.  Sure.  Why not?  I don't care.  Well.  The lying.  People will love the fact that this weekend we'll play the fucking.  No, we got it all over again.  Yeah, we got to rest that bit, because it was really long.  Yeah, give it six months.  Give it.  We'll do it in the future.  That's a great idea.  In the future.  Maybe that's a Labor Day special.  There you go.  Maybe you're going to do that.  Labor Day. 
[00:09:00]  Don't we do some kind of Labor Day, like, fucking.  Firecracker 500.  Oh, that's the 4th of July.  Yeah.  Don't we do some working for the weekend fucking special or something.  Or something like that, right?  Dunk, dunk, dunk.  Wow.  Oh, all right.  Well, that was fun yesterday, but we're all looking at them a little differently today.  Yeah, there is just something a little different now.  Did anyone go through the two and a half hours and get all the lies together?  Yeah, I have a list that I can pull up. 
[00:09:30]  Someone, not someone, a few people on Twitter said, oh my God, this is way better to listen  to in the replay knowing.  Oh, how it ends up.  Because at the beginning, you get his original story, which you forget by the end of the  whole segment.  Right, right.  But if you listen the whole first time, the second time, you're like, oh, wow, that's  a lie.  That's a lie.  And he's so adamant about it, and he's fucking lying.  I didn't realize that, yeah, that could be a good listen the second time around. 
[00:10:00]  Absolutely.  That's the lies?  It's just a list of, it's a fact sheet.  Oh.  And so, like, as you go down the list, they start contradicting each other.  You want to do it real fast?  Well, you got Rob canceling the party on account of weather.  Okay.  Which we found out was a lie.  Right.  He says the cookies were for the party, which we found out was a lie.  Yeah.  Said he notified people through Facebook private message, which he contradicted later.  He said he invited 30, 12 RSVP'd, so then he said he canceled, which he said was not 
[00:10:30]  the reason he canceled later.  Uh-huh.  He said all the party favors were stored in the fridge and basement.  We later found out he had no party favors.  Right.  He said he had two to three 30-packs of beer, which he later admitted was a lie.  Uh-huh.  He said he already had some beer, but he got more.  He said that was a lie.  He hadn't gotten any more.  He wasn't sure how many hot dogs and hamburgers he had, which we later found out was a lie.  He just had a few that he didn't buy.  Well, just basic stuff you would have in your house.  He said he bought five two-liter bottles of soda, which we found out was a lie. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  He said he didn't buy any.  Oh, God.  He said he sent messages through the event page, which was deleted.  Oh.  Rob said everybody said they weren't coming, which is why he didn't tell anyone from the  show that the party was canceled, which we found out was a lie, because Anthony and  Jim both did not say they weren't coming.  Uh, he didn't want to call his parents because they wouldn't be awake.  We then found out his mom was a teacher, so she would be awake.  Uh, he said he didn't really use Facebook, but he used Facebook to plan the event. 
[00:11:30]  Uh, he says he deletes text messages.  A lie.  We looked at his text messages.  Oh, my God.  This is unbelievable.  He said he canceled the event at 11 a.m. on Facebook.  His tweet was at 2.45 p.m.  Uh, he said his friends called him after they texted him, which was a lie.  Nobody had texted him.  Uh, he said his parents were bummed that the party wasn't happening.  Uh, he said his parents were helping out, which was a lie. 
[00:12:00]  His mom was at a, uh, at a, whatever, a bridal shower, and his dad was golfing.  Right.  Uh, he also said his mom suggested canceling it, and his dad was playing golf, which was  a lie, because he was helping his brother move.  He said his brother was moving Sunday, which was a lie.  He later said it was Saturday.  Uh, he said the cookies were made on Sunday for the party on Saturday.  Right.  Uh, that's just weird.  He said he hung out with his brother, and then at 9 p.m. they went drinking in Nyack, which  was a lie.  He didn't hang out with them. 
[00:12:30]  He helped him move.  Uh, he said his parents moved his brother on Sunday after that, which was a lie.  Right, because, uh, because his brother moved on Saturday.  Right.  Uh, keep going.  He said he deleted the event page Saturday night, even though he canceled the event in  the morning.  Right.  Uh, he mentioned the cancellation on the timeline earlier.  He said he had DM'd people.  Uh, he finally admitted nobody wanted to come.  He never told Travis the party was canceled.  Uh, Rob admits to lying about the deleted text. 
[00:13:00]  He says there were, now he says there are 45 to 50 beers.  He earlier said there were two to three 30-packs.  He later said that there was 20 to 30 beers.  He says he, uh, deleted text messages because he was talking dirty to girls, which he later  admitted he wasn't talking dirty to any girls, and those text messages weren't deleted.  Uh, he used the phrase naughty dirtily.  And, uh, Rob says he's been with seven women, though Sal points out that previously on the 
[00:13:30]  after show, Rob said he had been with five women.  And that's just, that's just some of them.  Yeah.  Not to bore everyone, but there you go.  Apparently too late.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's creepy.  That's a lot of fucking lies in that, uh, segment.  I guess it's easier to catch people in lies.  You just, you just force them to, that's, pound them long enough.  That's why they keep them in that room as long as they do, and just keep them talking.  Keep them talking.  Exactly.  Keep them talking.  Just keep them talking.  They will hang themselves. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  That's how it works.  We learned a lot yesterday.  Go for him.  Go for him.  That looks bad when it's listed in a row like that.  Oh, yeah.  And that's just some of them.  Psychotic.  Yeah.  That's just some.  That's not even the second segment we did with him.  Oh, really?  That's just the first segment.  Oh, boy.  Oh, right.  The second segment had a whole new batch of lies.  Right.  Which dispelled our theory.  Oh, there it is.  There's that girl from fucking, damn.  You think she's, oh, yeah, she is hot.  Dude, she's fucking hot as shit.  Yeah, we're talking about the valedictorian. 
[00:14:30]  They won't give her her diploma because she said hell in her speech, I guess.  She said hell in her fucking valedictorian speech, and, uh.  We're still bothered by the word hell?  I don't know.  What is she?  A Catholic school or something?  Ridiculous.  Yeah, what kind of school is that?  Come on.  Is it a regular school?  Get that.  Oh, man.  A fucking stupid cock on her face.  What a message that is to send out.  You're a valedictorian, and they harp on the word hell.  Like, what a heady.  I need to know what kind of school, first of all.  Yeah, what kind of school is this?  Maybe it's one of these really over-the-top hoity-toity schools. 
[00:15:00]  Should be allowed no matter what, but now I need more info.  It appears to be a public high school.  H-E double hockey sticks, she should have said.  Is it in the Bible Belt?  It's in Oklahoma.  It is in the Bible Belt.  Oh, see, the Bible Belt.  Prager, Prague.  They look at things a little differently.  She's fucking pretty hot, though, I would say.  Yeah.  Any more pics of her?  Come on.  I don't like that one.  That's Facebook-type magic picture.  A little voodoo action?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  It would be a good picture.  Making yourself look a little better than you are.  Yeah, it would be a good picture.  Yeah, so she, um, so what is it?  They can't stop her from graduating from saying hell.  That's, oh boy, you sure fell into a fucking advertising pop-up loop, didn't you?  Come on, Sam, stop looking at ads.  What the fuck happened, Sam?  ABC News.  Jesus.  Relax a little bit, please.  He loves a good ad, Sam.  Oh, is that her?  Fucking A, yeah.  Christ on a pony.  It's a million girls that look like that. 
[00:16:00]  She's fine.  No, come on.  That's hotness right there.  I mean, she's not.  What?  She's good.  Get out of here.  That's fucking crazy hot.  She's got you on her side.  That's what makes you really fucking...  Oh, man, look at that dress.  See?  Fucking fuck are in the ass.  Whoa.  You might call the Victorian speech, either.  I don't know if the valedictorian's taking it in the ass.  That's pretty good.  Oh, man, she's a crazy girl, too.  Look at her.  Halloween costume.  And she's wearing a devil's fucking shirt.  That's very satanic. 
[00:16:30]  It's Halloween.  I'll paint my face.  Support the team.  I know that one.  Of course.  That one I know.  Yeah.  So what happens?  She says, hell, they say, well, now you can't get a diploma until you apologize.  And she turned around and said, well, guess what?  I'm not apologizing.  Yeah.  And then in the end, what?  They have to give her her diploma, right?  They have to.  Non-story.  Move on.  Good.  Good for her.  You open a fucking mouth.  Wow.  You all right?  Yeah.  I got a little crazy when I saw that.  Got all horned up. 
[00:17:00]  I got all horned up.  Yes.  You like hearing horned up Anthony?  Horned up.  It's all horned up.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That's a fucking weird story.  Ooh.  What happened there?  All right.  That looks a little weird.  She's cute, though.  That's a little weird.  Not in all pictures.  No.  She has nice blue eyes.  She looks better, like, now.  Those are older pictures.  I would take it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the black guy doing in that montage?  Oh, boy.  Trying to get some m'dickin', as they call it. 
[00:17:30]  M'dickin'.  What was the guy who brought in the cider?  Remember the guy who had, like, the m'dickin' cider and he said that he came up with it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one, too.  That's another liar.  Yeah.  Add him to the list.  Do you rock?  Why is it all the interns that are lying?  Because they want to impress.  Was his name Piers?  Was that intern Piers?  Yeah, I think it was.  He made a fucking, the dickin' cider bit, and it was, we're like, oh, yeah, this is great.  Hey, listen to this.  And we played the exact same bit.  And we answered it.  Ten different times, remember?  Yes.  Yes.  We said, you made this up? 
[00:18:00]  And he goes, yes, I did.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, wow, that's pretty original.  Well, that bit has probably been redone more than any other radio bit.  Did he do Cleetaurus, too?  I love Cleetaurus.  Cleetaurus.  Not many people have done the Cleetaurus.  Cleetaurus.  A lot of people, let's see, I'm trying to remember, you know what I need, like Kevin from Connecticut  or some of these other fucking students of radio, but the dickin' cider bit is one of  the top ones ever.  Also, giving away a toy Yoda. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, that one.  Not so many dummies in trouble.  Including, oh, Rocco.  Hey, dude.  He's dead, too.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  The toy Yoda is a big one, too, where everyone thinks you're actually giving away a toy Yoda.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of others.  Oh, toy Yoda.  And then, yeah, you're going to win a toy Yoda.  Oh, wow.  And then it's a toy Yoda.  100 grand.  Whoa. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, hey.  Hey, now.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait.  You know something?  He makes a valid point.  We were the first on that one.  Yeah.  We really were.  Oh, boy.  We really were.  That was our spin.  And now everyone's saying the mayor's dead and all that.  And come on.  Hey, Master Bader was mine.  Shut up.  For the time.  Hey, Master Bader was.  Oh, hilarious.  Terrific.  Macarena was huge.  What are you going to do?  Yikes.  What other bits? 
[00:19:30]  Trying to think about those bits that have been done a million times.  Toyota.  Oh, I know.  The phone call.  And this is always a setup, you fucking assholes.  Where you get a guy on the line and say, hey, you want a dozen roses?  Who do you want to give them to?  Oh, God.  And then, of course, on a national radio, not a national, whatever, a big radio show,  of course, he's going to say, well, give it to Leanne.  Who's Leanne?  Well, she's my mistress. 
[00:20:00]  She's my girlfriend.  And then on the phone is his actual girlfriend.  What?  Who's Leanne?  Who's Leanne?  Oh, I'm so low.  Who's Leanne?  What I meant?  God.  I'm getting two chills.  Oh, look what happened there.  Oh, my God.  We didn't expect this to happen.  Oh, my God.  We thought we were just giving away roses.  Holy crap.  Oh, my God.  We're in a quandary now.  Oh, that fucking bit.  By big radio shows. 
[00:20:30]  What are they called?  War of the Roses or something?  Oh, yeah.  It's called War of the Roses.  War of the Roses.  Like, who do you want to give the roses to?  Well, I want to go to a lovely lady that I've known for many years.  Listen, she swept me off my feet.  Her name is Mary.  Mary!  Mary!  Who the fuck?  Well, well, who's this?  It's your girlfriend.  What is she?  Oh, you're in trouble now.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, no.  Why would we do this?  And then into spots.  Right.  Well, we better go to break so these two can work this out.  We'll have 20 songs in a row after this.  It's the only bit they get to do in the morning.  Oh, God.  That made me uncomfortable.  Oh, right?  It's been done a million times.  And now it's awful.  The high fives that are going on during fucking a Journey song.  Wow, that was great.  What a great bit that was. 
[00:21:30]  You only pulled it off, don't you think?  Now we'll replay it at 9.10, 9.40, run through it, play it 80 times.  I think the sales girl did a great job as the mistress.  Oh, great job.  And, of course, the flowers were supplied to us.  Oh, my God.  Poor flowers.  And it's frustrating to us because we know this shit goes on, and so many people just buy into it.  That's why I go to Justin in Tampa.  Justin, go ahead, sir.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, Seacrest on his morning show on KISS FM. 
[00:22:00]  Seacrest.  Ryan Seacrest, who just signed a $100 million contract, I believe, is doing War of the Roses.  Is he really?  What a fucking cunt.  Isn't that great?  Why is he doing that?  God, he stinks.  Yeah.  Ryan Seacrest is fucking so overrated on so many levels.  Well, he's exactly what the people want.  He had to play a DJ during a closing ceremony of the Olympics.  Can you find War of the Roses with Ryan Seacrest? 
[00:22:30]  Why is he doing that?  He's a safe guy.  If you're making $100 million, you should probably give your audience something better than that, though.  No.  Oh, they love it.  No, it's just fucking, here's the latest Blah Blah song.  Here's a safe interview with Blah Blah, and here's a safe fucking bit over here.  Why wouldn't you, when his ratings are through the fucking roof, because middle America and fucking, all that, those assholes love it.  No, they're, Ryan's, Roses, okay, here we go.  This is the people we're talking about.  Is this it?  Has been done a million fucking times. 
[00:23:00]  Stop!  Are you kidding?  He really did?  I thought you were fucking around.  I just hope a fugitive doesn't come and steal all Ryan Seacrest's money.  Oh, the fugitive!  Well, the dog was coming up to me, and I had to.  The fugitive is a relatively new bit some radio asshole came up with and decided to shove down radio's throats.  I'm talking about the ones that have been around forever.  This, this War of the Roses bit is easily, I don't know, at least 10 years old. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  At least.  We were on regular radio when they were doing this.  It's so fucking stupid.  So it could be 15 years old at this point.  I mean, honestly.  Hit it.  Honestly.  Ryan Seacrest.  Amanda from Rentscookamonga writing us about a third phone she saw on her bill.  Doesn't have a third phone.  She and her husband only have two, so she found it in the car.  And he saw a lot of text messages and calls to a specific number.  And they're very suspicious text messages.  Been with this.  All to one number.  All to one number. 
[00:24:00]  Been with this guy for nine years, married for five years.  All right.  So what I need you to do, Amanda.  Yeah.  Can you pause that real quick for one second?  I will say this.  But he really is selling it like it's.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  His acting is good.  He's selling it.  He's not selling it like it's been done 200 times.  What is it?  You think this is fake?  Oh, it is so fake.  But the way he's selling it is actually, I'll give him credit, at least he's selling, he's  selling a pile of horseshit like it really is a box of chocolates.  He better, for the money he makes, he better at least be good at his shitty old bits. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Ryan, you have my permission to call, and then whatever his name is, on Kiss FM.  Okay.  Ryan, you have my permission to call on Kiss FM.  Pause.  Okay.  Pause.  I know the FCC rules.  That's not good enough.  That's not good enough.  That's not good enough.  You're not allowed to fucking call anyone live on a radio show anymore like that.  You can't just bamboozle somebody like that.  You can't bamboozle guys.  But this is Ryan's way of getting, because everybody knows that now. 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  And the fake bits have been smashed.  Right.  This is his way of getting around that.  Right.  So the audience goes, oh, that's what you gotta do.  Oh, so it's true now.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  In a way, it's smart.  But that, we just know radio, and that's, you can't, that's not good enough.  This guy, if this was real, could sue the fuck out of Ryan Seacrest and his company.  Sure.  Oof.  That's not the audience should be able to sue.  Oh, gosh.  She's on fucking TV now.  Shit.  She's a high school girl.  Huh?  What?  She's probably not even the hottest girl.  She's a dirty mouth. 
[00:25:30]  Saying the H-E-L-L word.  H-E-L-L.  Horned up Anthony is a little weird.  He's horned up this morning.  I know.  Why are you horned up?  What happened last night?  Sometimes I just see something and get a...  What happened?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  Get all horned up.  You might want to get some poison out.  No, no, no.  He's gonna jerk off in the bathroom at 7 o'clock in the morning.  Nice.  The work jerk.  Nothing better than a work jerk.  When you said what happened, that reminded me of in Taboo 2, when Aunt Peg was massaging. 
[00:26:00]  What was her name?  I loved her.  The big, big tits.  She was so hot.  She played the mother in Taboo 2, and she had seen Junior in the flower shop.  Oh, my goodness.  And she saw Junior's big, bulging penis.  Oh.  So later, she's getting a massage from Aunt Peg.  And Aunt Peg is like, touches her pussy and goes, what happened today?  Oh.  You're absolutely dripping.  Wow.  She went nothing.  And she's like, come on, Barbara.  Tell me.  And she starts playing with her pussy.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's kind of hot.  It was fucking so dirty. 
[00:26:30]  That's a good one.  Aunt Peg recognized the extra moisture that Barbara had in her pussy.  Oh, that Aunt Peg.  It was so dirty.  She knows a fucking pussy that's been fucked.  I didn't like the line.  Look, she opens her pussy and puts her finger, and she goes, let your lips do the talking.  Oh, God.  I still like the scene, but that one, that line, I was like, all right.  That line's a little over the top.  Older porn, way hotter, right?  Oh, my God, dude.  Way fucking hotter.  Aunt Peg was in her fucking 40s when she did that.  And the woman.  Was she all right for?  Oh, yeah.  And the woman was with gigantic, real breasts.  She was British.  Uh, I can't, I'm ashamed that I can't remember her name. 
[00:27:00]  The mother, not Dorothy, I forget her, but she's an old school porn lady, but they had  hairy pussies, and they were regular looking, in shape women.  Did you see, God, I got, you know, I got to favorite this shit so I could bring it up.  A guy sent a picture of this girl.  She was, um, wearing, like, a completely see-through one piece thing.  It looked like maybe at a rock festival or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You saw that, too?  The big bush.  And the big bush showing through the, and it looked like it could have been, like, her 
[00:27:30]  panties.  There was something.  Yeah, it was weird.  There was something almost hot about it.  Almost.  It's great.  Did you like, well, I don't, I mean, it was a little, it was all the way to the sides.  That was crazy looking.  Was it meant to look like panties, or was it?  I don't know.  Yeah, in a way, man.  And I wish I saved it for whoever sent me that.  Thank you.  I think it was in the little thing she was wearing, like, to cover up the pussy, but  it looked like a bush.  No.  Oh, man.  If the person's awake right now or someone else knows about it, send the picture in, 
[00:28:00]  please.  All right, let's go back to Ryan's secret.  A K-something.  K?  Oh, my God.  It's making me crazy.  Look it up on your phone.  Be an easy lookout.  Okay, yeah.  Juliet Anderson?  K-Parker.  Thank you very much.  That's Aunt Peg, Anthony.  K-Parker?  K-Parker.  That was the porn star.  All right.  K-Parker?  Yeah, she was a natural-looking older woman in the 70s.  She was fucking...  In the 80s, she was smoking sexy.  She's got a couple of dicks over there, isn't she?  Yeah.  Let your lips do the talking.  Wait, let me look at her. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you would like K-Parker.  She was the shit, man.  Uh-oh.  She was very matronly, but...  I hope he's all horned up.  Yeah.  I'm a little horned up.  Yeah.  Horned up.  Got a bunch of stiff pricks in the room.  We sure run the gamut in here about what horns us up.  Yeah.  Some big and heavies from an old porn.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Oh, look at her big hairy fox.  Yeah, she's very 70s.  Vagina.  That's great.  Old school.  Come on.  Yeah.  Kind of love some vintage.  But then again, the old porns introduced you to those cement tits. 
[00:29:00]  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  Cement tits.  They've figured out the implants a little better.  Yeah.  Remember, they were just fucking...  Oh, my God.  Dags.  Horrible.  Why isn't Warren Sapp on our show today?  We had a good time with him last time.  Warren Sapp.  Oh, Sapp.  We didn't say no to him, did we?  No.  We've got this season right around the corner.  We want this guy close.  He's plugging a book.  He's wild.  Is he doing radio, though?  He might have been...  I didn't see his name on...  He was up here yesterday.  Was he?  What?  Howard. 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  Hard.  Didn't we have a good time with him?  Yeah.  Apparently not.  Are we just a stopover for people?  You know, when you fly from...  We're fucking...  We're Willoughby.  You fly from New York to L.A., you know, you've got to do a quick stopover in Dallas or  Atlanta or something.  Did he do anything else on the platform?  Not that I know of.  I think it was just Howard.  Warren, what are you doing?  We had a good time.  What happens to these guys after the door closes?  Why do the public...  It's the publicist.  These guys don't even know.  But the publicists probably are told, we would appreciate it if you just do this show.  Well, how about we tweet Warren and say, hey... 
[00:30:00]  No, don't kill him.  Just say, hey, Opie and Anthony really would like to get back on the show.  Certainly.  Maybe he doesn't know.  I guarantee you.  Fair enough to Jim Norton.  Maybe he doesn't know.  I swear to God, the guy had a great time.  He was phenomenal.  After the mics were off, we were all talking.  He's like, can't wait to come back.  Yeah.  You know, when football season's closer, I would love to, you know, come back on and talk  to you guys.  But if he's promoting a book...  Weird.  Why not?  I don't know.  All right.  Let's get back to Ryan Seacrest.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  So what happened here?  So we got the permission.  He got the permission to call this guy.  To call the guy.  And fuck up his life, which you're just not allowed to do on radio anymore.  Right.  You used to be able to, and it was great.  Phone call now.  Patty's going to come in here and offer him the roses.  We want to find out who he sends them to.  If he sends them to you, Amanda, then that's a good sign.  If not, exactly.  But be quiet if he says somebody else's name, because we want to find out what he puts on  the card.  He will not know we're here. 
[00:31:00]  But any guy that's cheating wouldn't do this.  No.  Why would they do this?  Why would they do this?  On the radio.  But they don't know you're on the radio.  But you only have...  She has permission.  The lady gave permission to call, but he doesn't say I...  The victim doesn't give permission yet.  Well, I've seen...  Okay.  Because I've seen the bit done where they do know they're on the radio.  Oh, they say, yeah, no.  That's why she said, I give you permission to call.  That was his way around explaining how what horseshit this is.  Let's see how he does this.  All right, all right.  Because there are a couple different ways to do that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  What's happening?  All right.  Stand by.  Stand by.  Hello?  Hi, good morning.  May I speak to Peter, please?  I'm speaking.  Peter, hi.  My name's Patty.  I'm calling from Golden Flowers.  How are you?  Good.  How are you? 
[00:32:00]  I'm doing good.  Thank you so much for making my call.  I'm calling...  I just want to point out dumb shit.  Why would you change your voice?  No one knows who you are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's to be funny and interesting.  Is that why?  I don't know.  It's neither.  It is funny.  It's terrible and stupid and dull.  It's not a person listening that knows your regular voice.  It's just your regular...  Oh, whatever.  Showcasing her talent.  No, you're right.  It's awful.  You're going to receive a free dozen roses. 
[00:32:30]  Hmm?  What happened?  Rose.  Come on now.  Everyone else wants...  They are completely free.  You can send them to whoever you want this morning.  I'm sorry.  I'm not interested in any marketing stuff.  Peter, they're completely free.  I don't need any billing information from you.  I don't need a credit card.  I don't need your address.  It's pretty simple.  All I need is the name of the person you want me to send them to, plus a note.  How did I qualify for this?  How did I get on that?  I have a database.  It's all confidential.  And your name popped up.  He plugged this.  Holy fuck.  I hate this. 
[00:33:00]  What Ryan is doing here.  I'll give him credit for this.  He really is trying...  He's trying to sell it.  ...to remove all the stuff that people see as bullshit.  Right.  Like, because you would say, how did you get my name?  How did you get my name?  People are a little more savvy now than they used to be.  Not interested.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just...  Does that still bother you?  Yeah, a little bit.  You've got to go to the doctor, dude.  Oh, stop.  Your hands still bother you?  Yeah, my knuckle hurts a little bit today.  You've got to go to the doctor.  You broke your hand.  Oh, stop.  Let me see your head.  You've got to get a cast put on your fucking hand.  What cast?  Or something. 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  You're moving pretty good.  It moves fine.  We'll just go to the doctor.  It moves fine, but it just hurts today.  But the swelling's down.  A little hurting.  You're holding ice on it for no reason.  Well, no, it's a reason.  It hurts.  It hurts a week.  How long ago was Chicago?  A week and a half ago.  Yeah, that's a little long for it to still be aching.  Maybe it's going to rain today.  I was...  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was a little...  It was like I was using it a little too much, I think.  You know, jack it off to the fucking girl. 
[00:34:00]  The valentine.  Now we know why he's horned up.  He can't jack off.  I can use a left hand.  I'm good.  Left hand.  Ambidextrous.  And we can both go to the doctor.  You can go to your hand doctor and I can, for the second day in a row, go see sleep apnea  people who won't help.  Oh, no.  All right.  Let's go.  Jimmy.  It's just a nightmare.  You have central sleep apnea.  I know!  I've been telling you that for fucking six months.  Assholes.  Doctors...  They're really shit.  Dr. Steve is such an anomaly because he cares.  Oh, I was hoping you would say he's the king of all shits. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, no.  But he cares as a doctor.  Like, most of them just don't give a fuck.  They're lousy.  They're really lousy.  Yeah.  All right.  Snowflowers, whoever you want.  Okay, so let me get this straight.  I've qualified for a free dozen roses.  I don't have to put any information down, any credit card, nothing like that.  No, I'm not asking you for anything.  All I need is the name of the person you want me to send them to, plus a note.  And, of course, if you like my service, you can go ahead and refer me to your friends  or family.  I gotcha. 
[00:35:00]  Sure.  Sure, I'll take them.  Okay, who do you want to send them to?  Oh, I say get, like, a note or something on it?  Yes, you do.  You get a pretty nice note.  Okay, so make it out to Sandra.  Sandra, okay.  And can you write down...  Let me think.  Write down, I hope this brightens your day the way you brighten mine.  Uh, I can't wait to finally, uh, hang out.  Well, that is sweet. 
[00:35:30]  Very sweet, actually.  That's very sweet.  Who's Sandra?  Who the f*** is Sandra?  Hello?  Yes, hello?  Who the f*** is Sandra, Peter?  Peter, it's Ryan Seacrest and your wife, Amanda, on the line.  I'm sorry, did you say...  You're on the radio, Peter.  I'm sorry, did you say...  You stupid s***.  I...  Oh, God.  Who's, uh, who's Sandra?  Oh, God.  Peter, who's Sandra?  Sandra's just a friend of mine.  I don't understand how...  It's a friend.  Who is that?  Oh!  You don't hang up.  Wait a second.  It's Sandra that... 
[00:36:00]  Sandra's that f*** waitress at Chili's, isn't she?  The waitress at Chili's.  The waitress at Chili's.  The waitress at Chili's.  The waitress at Chili's.  Ryan.  That's good.  Oh, Ryan.  Yes.  He is sick.  Terrible.  That's horrid.  He is terrible.  With all the money you're making, fucking hire good actors.  Yeah.  He makes a shitload.  And you're in Hollywood.  Go to a casting agency and say, hey, I need a dope and a fucking broad.  Yeah, get someone who can act. 
[00:36:30]  Holy f***.  They said that the note hadn't been sent.  Sent.  Sent.  I got them.  It'll brighten my day.  I'll brighten your day.  Sent a dozen roses to a girl.  She was younger than Hooper over here.  She was younger than Miss Hooper.  Miss Hooper over here.  They told me the note hadn't been sent.  And sent.  Deliver the roses.  A dozen roses. 
[00:37:00]  Well, we delivered the roses.  August 20th.  2012.  She's on the show, Chief.  He gets to say Chief on the phone for no reason.  Who?  Oh, this is younger than Mr. Seacrest here.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we have to hear the end.  This is exciting.  It's horrendous.  And there's a lot more.  It's like halfway over.  I think it's going to end with a lot of big laughs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, good luck with that situation.  There ought to be a matter. 
[00:37:30]  Dozen roses went into the vase.  By morning, there were nine left.  I went to admire a rose.  I realized it had been plucked in half.  Don't know how many girlfriends.  Maybe a thousand.  I just want to do Quint all the day.  I wish I could do an amazing Quint, because I would literally do Quint Day on the radio. 
[00:38:00]  It's just Quint Day.  I want to do Quint Day.  Everything like Quint.  You do a pretty good job of it.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let's go with this.  Peter.  Oh, that looks good.  Hello?  Peter.  Peter.  Oh, we got a comment.  Dramatic hangout.  Oh, we got a call.  We get it.  He hung up.  We get it.  Peter's hung up on you.  Peter.  So, wait.  Who is Sandra?  I can't believe he hung up.  Sandra is this stupid.  She's a kid.  She's some waitress that waits on us at Chili's. 
[00:38:30]  She's young enough to be his daughter.  Wait, what an awful couple.  She's a waitress who waits on us at Chili's?  You have a regular waitress at Chili's?  A regular Chili's waitress.  Stupid whore.  If you want to believe it.  How terrible is that?  No.  What a bad lie that is.  The back story is horrendous.  She's a regular waitress at Chili's.  Young enough to be his daughter.  She's just a kid.  You think Chili's bought the time? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, we have a Chili's tie-in here.  That sales got us.  We just have to mention Chili's a few times during the bit.  Who is a couple goes to Chili's?  It's Los Angeles.  It's not like a small town.  Oh, God.  It might be in a few other markets.  And then we drove our car that we got at Cal Worthington's.  Cal Worthington's used cars.  Can't play.  Father, you can't even believe it.  She's just, whenever we go to Chili's, and he will always insist that we go like every week to Chili's. 
[00:39:30]  We can't ever go anyplace else.  We go to this place and we always have to wait to sit in this kid's section.  And he always says, oh, well, you know, she's so sweet.  And her name is Sandra.  Well, how much of a kid is she?  No, she's like 18.  Oh, man.  And how old is Peter?  He's 40.  Beat that.  He's twice her age, at least.  I am serious.  He's so straight.  Well, what if it's a different Sandra?  I mean, that's not better, but still, you know. 
[00:40:00]  No, no.  Now that I think of it, they're always flirting.  And I thought, like, you know, it's their job to flirt with the customers or whatever she pays.  Is it a Chili's?  Chili's.  You flirt.  A lot of flirting going on.  Do you want a Chili's waitress flirting?  A lot of flirting going on.  A lot of sexy talk over there at Chili's.  She's like, so, would you like the diarrhea special?  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Yeah.  How about some jalapeno poppers?  I shove them in my ass and shoot them into your mouth.  They taste like baked clits. 
[00:40:30]  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  I'm just flirting because I know the guys like it here at Chili's.  Yeah.  That's how I get my tips.  Lick my gherkin nipples.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Oh, boy.  That woman's at Chili's so many times.  I hate Chili's a lot.  Yeah.  I put flair on each labia lip.  Peel them apart so you can see my Chili's buttons.  I don't know flair.  Flair.  Well, I have to hear how this ends.  This is getting crazy.  Of course.  It's getting nuts.  Peter back here.  Hang on one second.  Peter, who's Sandra? 
[00:41:00]  Peter's back.  Peter, are you back here?  Who's Sandra?  Why would he come back?  Is she a waitress at Chili's?  Is she 18?  And are you having an affair with her?  Oh.  Well, first of all, yes, she's...  Hold on.  Hold on just a second here.  I love the exasperated kind of...  I think it's so hard to do that well when you're acting.  It's just the hardest fucking thing to sound.  Because you're cutting yourself off.  Yes.  It's hard to cut yourself off.  Cut yourself off.  And mock, like... 
[00:41:30]  See?  I just stopped myself, but I didn't jump in.  I stopped myself.  You're cutting yourself off because you don't really have anything to say.  Right.  You realize in the moment, fuck, I don't have to...  When you're legitimately fucked up, something's going to come out.  No, but you have this...  You do stop talking, but because you don't know what you're going to say.  It's a different...  I was hoping you'd stop talking.  It's a different...  Getting chopped is a different than stopping yourself.  Because you don't know what you're going to say. 
[00:42:00]  But in this case, he knows what he wants to say, so it doesn't sound natural when you stop.  Yeah.  It's just poor.  It's awful.  It's hard.  It is hard to do, though.  So, like, how do you act?  But you wouldn't...  You'd be calm and...  She's a waitress.  She's a friend of mine.  We're picking us apart, but, I mean, Ryan, as far as regular radio goes, he's at the top of the heat.  Yeah.  He's, like, probably number one out there.  And he's doing this old gag.  As far as music radio goes.  He's doing this old gag. 
[00:42:30]  18, and no, I'm not having a fair...  Well, then why are you sending her flowers...  We give you an opportunity to send flowers to the woman that pops in your mind first.  And you pick the waitress at Chili's, and you say, hope this brightens your day the way you brighten mine.  Okay, well, first of all, I don't have to answer myself to you.  Oh.  Answer to your wife.  Answer to me.  I'm your wife, you idiot.  Okay.  Idiot.  I don't believe you.  Amanda, you've got to calm down.  You don't know what you're talking...  You don't know all the facts.  Why were you hiding a phone in your car? 
[00:43:00]  What's with the third phone?  Do you have a third cell phone?  Yes, I needed it for work.  Answer Sandra.  All the people you call for work is Sandra at Chili's.  She's old.  Say it again.  You're old enough to be her father.  Chili's.  Yay.  Sandra at Chili's on Sepulveda Boulevard.  Just so we're clear.  So, Peter, you hit a third phone from your wife.  You text a girl that serves Big Mouth burgers on a regular basis at Chili's.  What's that? 
[00:43:30]  And you're telling...  So, let me get this straight.  You stand out in the cold, and you pretend to laugh at a joke from a man who had a stroke  that you really can't understand.  See how much that hurts?  See how much that hurts there, Ryan?  So, you're using your Samsung phone to call her at Chili's.  When we go to Chili's, we have the delicious appetizers, which are always half-priced.  The Big Mouth Burger.  Why did we have to message the Big Mouth Burger?  Come on. 
[00:44:00]  It's a sales tie-in.  It's a sales tie-in.  It is.  Yeah, you're right.  That was a good call.  Yuck.  Wow.  Wow.  How do you send a card that says, I hope this brightens your day the way you brighten  mine.  Cannot wait to finally hang out with you.  That that's platonic.  That's business.  And that's a fire-grilled friend.  No, I mean, I have not done anything with her.  She's a friend of mine that's going through a tough time, and we've become friends over  the past year.  That's nice.  And, you know, she's going through a tough time, so I sent her flowers.  What's the big deal? 
[00:44:30]  What do you mean, what's the big deal?  What do you mean, what's the big deal?  The big deal is you should be doing that.  That's the big deal.  She can find another friend to help her through a tough time.  Listen to your wife.  Fuck his wife.  To me, you have a friend who's some 18-year-old chick at a restaurant at Chili's.  Who you're helping through a tough time with a separate cell phone.  It's all wrong.  You don't even tell.  That's how it ends, because they have no ending?  I guess.  They have no ending?  Why would, of course, the guy's like, you can't do that.  Why not be a guy for once and go, yeah, I get it. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's 18, you're just trying to dump a load.  Right.  Help this guy out.  Help me out here, Ryan.  I tried to bang this broad.  I helped you, didn't I?  I laughed at your New Year's Eve jokes, you motherfucker.  Help me out, Ryan.  Now, this is a YouTube video.  How many likes and dislikes?  Well, you're looking at...  Oh, and they don't have a...  Hey.  Like this, like thing.  Oh, well.  Okay.  And what are some of the comments?  Comments, they are all like, they believe it. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  All of them.  Oh, man.  Why would you believe that?  Oh, man.  We have inside info on radio, but why would you believe that?  Like what?  Just a friend helping them slash me get through a tough time.  That's every cheater's words.  Me and my friends have all heard that stale ass line many times.  Well, it's obviously dummies.  Who actually got through all this fucking audio and then commented on it?  Yeah.  There's nothing but a picture of roses in the video. 
[00:46:00]  The whole video is a picture of roses.  It's fucking horrid.  There's one.  Fake.  Ryan Seacrest is a fucking loser.  All right.  Cool.  From Dixie.  Yeah, no.  The rest of them are all just like talking about how great it is or they're happy the  cheater got caught.  Oh, man.  It's been done.  All right.  I'll send you roses.  A dozen roses.  For $20, you get the stem.  The pedals, the whole damn thing. 
[00:46:30]  You fucking.  This is the worst act, bitch.  Really?  Guy makes $100 million a year.  $100 million bucks doing that old thing.  Just for his radio career.  If we ever tried to pull that off, we'd be crucified.  Let's drink to your lie.  Let's drink to your lie.  Oh, God, no.  They would crucify us.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There you go.  I want to talk about Augusta next. 
[00:47:00]  Augusta.  What was going on there?  What was going on there?  They fucking caved.  Why?  Why?  The chicks?  And I want the women to call it a, why do you need to be in a guy's place?  I know.  Why?  And women have plenty of their own things.  I don't even know where the women hang out.  I don't know their clubs.  I don't care.  It's ridiculous.  Are we talking about this next?  Can we talk about this next?  Can we go to those quilting bees or something?  Why do they need to be where we are?  That's where the cock is.  Not one fucking person in the mainstream media will talk about it in this way. 
[00:47:30]  They're all like, oh, this is great.  It's about fucking time.  It's a private club, though.  I don't know why women care about it.  Oh, you know, is there a woman playing on the tour?  What?  Is there a woman playing on the tour or something?  What do you mean?  Was that what spurred this whole thing?  No.  Or was there one more female head of the sponsor or something?  Oh, well.  But it wasn't even that, I don't think it was that broad they let in.  I don't know.  They let two in.  They let Condoleezza Rice in.  Well.  As a member?  Yes.  Why would she want to be a member? 
[00:48:00]  I don't know.  You're the secretary of state.  What else do you need?  We'll talk about it next, because it gets people talking.  And, you know, we love women, but this is stupid shit.  I don't mind the fact that they let her in as a woman.  That's a two birds with one stone situation.  All right.  All right.  We got some repurposed audio.  This place loves repurposed audio.  Nice.  And so we got this going on a break. 
[00:48:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm going this motherfucker, friend, slug dick, I call her.  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  You know, she's, like, jumping in there.  And I'm going, no, just the guys, right?  I just want the guys.  And then I'm calling her over.  And this classless piece of fucking shit that talks like a fucking truck driver is giving me the fingers.  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics. 
[00:49:00]  I like girl comics that are fucking funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem.  I just hate the ones that fucking stink at what they fucking do.  And she's fucking awful.  And I think she's a scumbag for fucking with me.  How about you stay home and actually raise the fucking baby you have rather than trying out for a fucking Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck.  I'm telling you, honestly, I know her.  She's joking.  That's not real. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, then my mistake.  This has been Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  So we got Augusta National.  They had two female members for the first time in their 80-year history.  Finally, getting with the times. 
[00:50:00]  You know.  Condoleezza Rice and Darla Moore.  Darla.  I have a real problem with this.  And no one in the media will say they have a problem with this.  Sometimes guys just want to be guys and women want to be women.  And I don't understand why women have to just need to fucking join these clubs that are obviously for men.  It's that principle thing.  They're like, oh, you know, it's the principle of the whole thing. 
[00:50:30]  Why does it work both ways?  As guys, we don't give a fuck we're not part of women's groups.  Every so often you get that guy that wants to be a Hooters waitress.  But that's always a goof.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's always a goof.  Exactly.  I don't get it either.  I worked at a golf course for many years.  It's the only other job I've ever had.  I was a caddy and I've been in broadcasting.  That's all I know.  Winning that caddy tournament.  And guys, when they're on a golf course, they loosen up, they tell dirty jokes, they drink a little, they bust balls, and they just have a good time. 
[00:51:00]  And you can tell they're just getting away from maybe their wife for an afternoon, getting away from where they work for an afternoon.  Chili's waitress.  Where they can just fucking let their hair down, as we like to say.  And when I was at the Huntington Crescent Club, when the women came around, the guys would just stiffen the fuck up.  Always.  Because they were worried about what they were going to say.  They knew they couldn't fucking tell a dirty joke.  They knew they couldn't just pull their fucking penises out and be idiots. 
[00:51:30]  Which happened too.  And if the women want to join these things, it's one thing.  But it's always, it always ends up with them saying they were harassed or they don't like being in this environment of sexual fuck it.  And that's what ruins the whole fucking thing.  There's nothing wrong with guys going off and being guys for an afternoon or whatever, and girls going off and being girls for an afternoon.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Why do you have to mix the two?  Why? 
[00:52:00]  If women give a fuck about Augusta and golf, then fucking make your own club and say this is women's only.  No one will give a shit.  There's not a guy alive that will give a shit.  You know, the Huntington Crescent Club, they had Ladies' Day.  It was Tuesdays.  And the ladies came out.  I mean, it's kind of, you know, it was kind of rude.  They gave them one day, but whatever.  One day, huh?  And they went and they would have a good time.  I'd put a bunch of fucking big fat tampons in all the holes so they have to pull them out by the dumb string whenever they fucking go to putt. 
[00:52:30]  Plus it's also a known fact, and this is where I'll get in trouble, but it is the truth from where I, from my experience,  women play golf a lot slower than men.  So now it slows down the entire fucking game because they can't hit it as far.  And a lot less.  They play, women, that's much more, women like golf, but it's much more of a male thing than a female thing.  Much more.  I was reading Twitter.  It was driving me nuts.  Go to Piers Morgan's stupid Twitter.  Oh, well, it's about time, you Neanderthals. 
[00:53:00]  What is he talking about?  Oh, is that what he...  Who said that?  That fucking limey fuck says the dumbest shit on Twitter.  It was even worse than Neanderthals.  Could he come up with...  Did he say it right?  Like Neanderthal, which I hate.  Neanderthal.  Neanderthal.  Shut up.  What do you say about Augusta?  Neanderthal.  The shorts.  Oh, Jesus.  That's too much.  Take us home, baby.  No, no, no, no.  We've got to stay here for a little bit.  We really do.  Take us home.  Is that the word used?  Yeah.  What is the...  It was something like... 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Read the whole tweet.  Oh, no.  Finally, Augusta admits first female members, including Condoleezza Rice.  Welcome to the 21st century, gentle Minasauruses.  Again.  Again, the reason that women aren't allowed isn't because it's like, oh, we just don't  like women.  It's the effect it has on the club.  Right.  You are now fucking forbidden from doing anything.  They keep you from being a guy. 
[00:54:00]  Then there's sexual harassment, and then it's like, well, that's what happens.  Because now it's like, you open the floodgates, and now it's like, well, we need a lot...  Well, it's nice that he gave us two, but now we need a lot of women as members here.  But it's like, why do you need to be there?  For what?  Then they'll still get a little HR department just to make sure the women are safe.  It's so fucking stupid.  It really is.  And you sound like an asshole taking this point of view.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  But guys just want to be guys sometimes. 
[00:54:30]  And you know what?  There's not many places you can do that anymore.  There's just not.  Honestly, if all the women who are going there were like, like Bonnie...  Wait, wait, wait.  Well, the CEO's a woman.  Will she be given a membership, et cetera, et cetera?  Darla Moore, who's a close friend of Hootie Johnson, who used to be the chair.  Oh, please.  And Condoleezza Rice, obviously.  Save that thought, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  What do you think of them as first, as the two first female picks?  Well, I always thought that Condi would be the first.  And nobody wants to go in by themselves. 
[00:55:00]  So it's wonderful for women.  Darla Moore, it's a small world.  But my nephew is supervising the building with her name on it at the University of South Carolina.  This woman's a golf ball of fame.  So it's a very big project.  So she's very generous.  And, you know, it's great to have two women of their stature.  I've proven the stereotype wrong, by the way, about the LPGA.  What did you say Condoleezza Rice first as your pick? 
[00:55:30]  I don't know for sure, but wow.  Because every time I've talked to her, which is a few times.  That old jean jacket is a tell.  I mean, Condoleezza Rice and NFL commissioner.  You can't not talk about those two things.  I didn't realize she was a golfer.  Uh-oh.  Call her a golfer.  I've known she's a golfer.  She's a member of San Francisco Golf Club.  Come on.  And she just became a member of Cypress.  So I know she loves.  This is just boring.  I know.  But, I mean, it's not a great step for women, believe it or not.  It's not.  A great step for women would be to go and say, you know, fuck you and your stupid club. 
[00:56:00]  We'll make our own club.  Well, I get why she...  That woman is a golf hall of famer.  I get why she likes it.  Right.  But, uh...  Right.  Who cares?  Why do they want to...  Why would you want to be there?  That's what I don't understand about this whole thing.  It's a private club.  Fuck everything up.  That's what I don't understand about this.  Why do you need to be there?  Oh, I was going to say, if all the women are like Bonnie McFarlane, like had sense of humor  about shit, like that type of humor, like Bonnie doesn't care what you're doing as a  guy.  She doesn't give a fuck.  If women were like that, nobody would mind women being there because you could go off 
[00:56:30]  and do your dumb shit and she could care less.  But it's not going to be like that.  They're going to get offended.  Although, I will say this.  I think you show the world that you're just weak.  You show weakness.  Because the thing to do would be get all you, all the powerful women together and start  your own place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't you think, or am I completely fucking batshit crazy on this one?  Could you see if Condoleezza Rice, Overhood, did you hear the one about the Jew, the Catholic 
[00:57:00]  and the colored boy?  I heard that one, Judge.  That's a hoot.  I don't know.  You know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just.  And admitting Condoleezza Rice, it's such a fucking phony.  Yeah.  It's like, there's nowhere in the world Condoleezza Rice shouldn't be able to go, honestly.  I mean, once you're the secretary of state, you should have carte blanche to go anywhere  on the planet. 
[00:57:30]  Certainly.  Why is she, like, it's such a fake gesture.  Yeah.  Admitting somebody so powerful and so obviously connected and so obviously iconic.  Yep.  Like, how about you just admit a regular, if you're going to do it, admit a regular.  Just some broad.  Or a regular golfer, you know.  Right.  No, it has to be someone of stature.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  I guess this did start, thanks, Real John Deezio.  Pressure from the media.  IBM's new CEO is a woman and IBM is a major sponsor of the tournament. 
[00:58:00]  Boy, I am.  Did they threaten to pull out?  Because again.  I don't know.  I don't know how exactly that all went down.  Augusta didn't have to do this.  They could have said, they said, fuck you for 10 years and they could have just kept  saying, fuck you.  But I guess they got to be too much.  The question coming in, what locker room do these two women use?  They'll find a spot at Augusta to make a women's locker room.  Yeah.  Or they might have one even.  I don't know.  Do they allow women as guests or something?  I'm sure they do, yeah.  Yeah, they probably do.  I'm sure at some point there's going to be some lawsuit. 
[00:58:30]  You'll hear about it.  And a lawsuit, Augusta, women claiming sexual, like not even sexual harassment.  It'll be like a hostile environment.  You know, this guy, let's go with this.  John of North Carolina.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, John.  Hey, I wonder if I could try to join the local gym up here called Curve for women only.  Yeah, they have women only gyms now.  Lane Bryant. 
[00:59:00]  And the reason is because they don't like to be ogled while they're working out and stuff.  Yeah.  Meaning they want to be able to be women.  Right.  And be able to relax as women.  But they love castrating men whenever men want to hang out.  Isn't that the same thing?  Guys at a golf course want to just be guys without worrying about who's looking on.  Yeah.  It's the same fucking thing.  But as a guy, we don't give a fuck.  We're not going to, you know, force society to allow us to join Curves. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, Curves.  Yeah.  Although it'd be kind of cool.  No, it's a fun afternoon just hanging out in a park a lot about Curves.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oops.  Curves.  They're coming in and out in their yoga pants.  Well, you wouldn't get any pressure.  That's a wonderful afternoon.  You could do it, but you wouldn't get pressure.  This is all average.  This is all pressure.  Right.  Like, nobody made a gust to do it because they're a private club.  But they could have stuck to their guns and said, we don't care, like they did one year.  They should have just stuck to what they would do.  Yeah, something changed.  Yeah.  They're feeling a lot of heat or pressure or something.  Maybe it's a money thing. 
[01:00:00]  But, yeah.  I mean, women understand this point of view, obviously, if they're setting up places like Curves.  Yeah.  You know?  They don't have to worry about shit when they go into those gyms.  God, at least you're right.  That annoys me so much that they picked such a high-profile woman.  Yeah.  Of course.  Now, Kevin from Connecticut, yes, they should allow Lacey Underalls.  Lacey.  Now, I wouldn't have a problem with that.  Lacey Underalls.  Wah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah.  Remember the music they used when she was walking?  Quite a change from dreary old Manhattan. 
[01:00:30]  Can we see Lacey Underalls, please?  Lacey Underalls.  Remember the no bra?  Ah-oh-ah-ah.  That's when he goes, ah-oh-ah-ah-ah.  He saw those nippies.  She was nipping out.  We used to say nipping out.  We were cool.  Do you have a video of Lacey Underalls from Caddyshack?  Yeah, I was getting real tired of having fun.  Ah-oh-ah-ah-ah.  Oh, you sound like a fucking dick if you take this point of view, but someone has to say 
[01:01:00]  it.  It's like, it's not right.  It's just weird that women need this so badly.  But I have such a, I have a dislike of the men that belong to Augusta, too, most of those  guys, because they're elitist dumb eggs.  Oh, they're assholes.  They would fucking step over us.  Yeah, they're terrible people.  They're complete.  I mean, you know, there were a lot of assholes at the dumb Huntington Crescent Club.  I can only imagine how they are at Augusta.  They would, they wouldn't even give us the time of day.  They're terrible.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Of course.  We went to war together.  We golfed.  We golfed.  Me and your father built this club.  We just don't make comedies like this anymore.  Showing our age.  Give us a Lacey Underalls Club.  Ladies.  Oh, you ain't finding shit, are you?  What is this?  What is this?  What did you find?  What did you find?  That's not even close.  That wasn't even Caddyshack.  The problem is every clip is her being interviewed at a Comic-Con or something.  Is she old now? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Of course she is.  She's old, but I mean, is she old?  Did we meet her in, uh...  Yeah.  You met her?  Yeah.  She wants to come on the show.  She's a fan of the show.  No way.  She is, right?  If she's a fan, then call right now Lacey Underalls.  Oh, man.  Whatever your real name is.  I feel bad now.  They'll always be Lacey Underalls.  Oh, we didn't say anything bad.  No.  We love her.  Go for it.  Wait, what's her real name?  Cindy Morgan?  Right.  Cindy Morgan?  Is that it?  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Someone's saying they didn't do this for money.  Uh, Carolina Man.  Oh, really?  Uh, Augusta.  Augusta has no, uh, visible brands other than the Masters logo.  No Budweiser, no Coke.  This wasn't done for money.  They don't need it.  That's bullshit.  Yeah, isn't IBM like a huge sponsor for...  Yes, it's behind the scenes stuff.  For the tournament?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They probably got increasing pressure from the...  They don't have logos, just the Augusta or whatever, but they get a lot of sponsorship  and commercial sponsors, and that's where the pressure's coming from.  Whoever's saying it's not for money, I believe you're incorrect. 
[01:03:00]  More info from Carolina Man.  Bill Gates had to beg his way into Augusta.  I heard that.  Really?  A billionaire.  Why?  Who has pretty much changed the world.  Yeah, he's done more for the fucking world than any of those scumbags.  He had a beg.  He had a beg.  They won't let...  A lot of times they won't let presidents scoff through.  Oh, they're scumbags.  They're just cunts.  I'll acknowledge that.  They're fucking scumbags, but...  Wow.  You know what Augusta needs?  A fire.  I would love that.  I would love a fire just to break out there.  I hate it. 
[01:03:30]  Not because I hate golf.  I don't like golf.  But most of the guys that play it are those fucking...  Yeah.  Just take more for themselves douches.  We had some cool guys.  Turned out the mafia guys were the coolest.  Yeah, of course.  I've said that a million times, but they knew how to take care of a person.  Yeah.  You just had to stay on their good side.  Yeah.  That's what you learned growing up as a kid.  I had to learn some fucking lessons as a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't piss off the mafia guys.  Bill Gates had to beg his way into it. 
[01:04:00]  I've heard that before, yeah.  What the fuck?  What if you put Caddyshack, Lacey, Introduction?  Try that.  How about we do this?  Because this guy's a little mad, I guess.  Rich in Georgia.  Rich?  Well, lucky you.  Hey, guys.  I was just going to say, Jimmy, you're wrong on this.  First thing is, Augusta doesn't get any sponsorships at CPS.  They get some sponsorships for the event.  And if you remember the whole initial thing about the women, they totally cut out all their sponsors.  And Augusta said, we'll fucking put the bill. 
[01:04:30]  Hold on.  Let me just jump in there before you – because you're right.  They did do that.  But obviously, they don't want to do that again.  They are getting money for it.  So they don't want to probably do that again.  And the pressure is mounting.  Of course it's money.  They did that one year.  But now it's obviously getting to be more and more pressure.  Of course it's money.  Dude, just believe me.  They're getting money.  And also the name, Augusta, being on – they don't want to be cut out.  CBS might have gotten advertiser pressure.  And then they threatened, we will just drop the coverage. 
[01:05:00]  And that does bother – they don't want that.  I would love to know what the real story is here.  It's money.  Something's going on that we don't know about.  You think it's just money?  Absolutely, it's money.  They would lose too much.  They just – they got too much pressure.  Yeah.  It's not about the money for Augusta because they have the wealthiest of the wealthiest people that are members.  However, the membership dues are relatively cheap compared to the rest of the country.  The problem is why there has to be wealthy people there is that they do assessments. 
[01:05:30]  And they assess members.  So if they have the average Joe as a member, the first time they do an assessment to improve the golf course, he's going to lose his membership.  And the thing about Bill Gates was, and the same thing about the IBM lady, is they try to – Augusta has this kind of unwritten rule where you send in your application and then they go through it.  Bill Gates tried to use insider influence in his whatever celebrity or whatever to try to get in. 
[01:06:00]  And the same thing happened with the IBM lady.  And because of that, that's why they didn't let her in.  But if you – if the real fact behind the whole –  Lisa Rice –  Dude, hold on, dude, hold on.  That's not why they didn't let her in.  What, because her application was wrong?  She hasn't –  Bill Gates, it's not that she tried to force her way in, Jimmy.  And Augusta doesn't give a shit and they don't need money.  It's a private course.  Then why do they do it?  All right, Rich, why do they do this? 
[01:06:30]  Because I guarantee you, you poll the members at Augusta, they're not for this.  Yes.  So why do they do this, in your opinion?  Look at the two women that they did.  Influential, Republican, conservative women.  Yes.  They did it on purpose because they thought that it'd be a great way of pissing off all  these fucking liberals who thought that, boy, we're going to force them into getting somebody  that we want.  And they didn't do it.  And they didn't kowtow to it.  Condoleezza Rice, by the way, is supposedly a very good golfer. 
[01:07:00]  And so is the lady from –  But why do they let women in at all if it's not about money?  It's not about money.  They just decided to do it.  And they –  No, man.  Because we've been following this story, we all have, for many, many years.  They've been fighting this, like –  You're going to tell me, dude, that one year, they're so adamant about it.  Which they were last year.  Jimmy's right.  They changed their tune drastically in one lousy year.  And a few years ago, dude, when they didn't take any advertising.  Remember the women protesting outside Augusta with the signs, and they said, 
[01:07:30]  ah, fuck those women.  We're going to control our own club.  Yeah, they got too much pressure, and they gave up –  And look, I'm not saying I don't understand why you give in to that much pressure.  But don't be – don't convince yourself that they did not give in to pressure,  because they absolutely did, dude.  They didn't want this.  But what's the pressure?  They were going to lose that much money?  I have a feeling that the sponsors started to come down on them,  and I also think that behind the scenes of the network.  And that does matter to them.  That's their whole thing.  It's one of the most prestigious clubs. 
[01:08:00]  Or was there a hint that the PGA would take the Masters away from them?  That's a very big possibility.  Well, I don't know.  Let me ask you something, dude.  If the PGA started getting tremendous pressure from the advertisers,  from the networks, and from the companies,  and they said, look, we will take this away from you,  don't tell me that doesn't matter to Augusta.  Yeah, that would be a massive hit for Augusta.  That wouldn't be a massive hit.  Oh, my God, you're crazy.  No, no, you're right.  You don't know golf.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, take the Masters away from us.  We're cool.  Oh, hey, the PGA.  Fuck Amen's Corner.  We don't need it.  Here, here, there you go.  Well, I mean, I know y'all, hey, y'all got the microphones.  No, no, no, dude.  The bottom line is we're talking to you,  but you just want it to be that Augusta did this great thing,  and you're refusing to acknowledge any other input.  Yeah, they were.  I don't think Augusta did a great thing.  I could give a shit.  But their hand was forced, and we want to know why.  Was it pressure from the PGA?  It was pressure from CBS, who I believe is the sponsor, you know, 
[01:09:00]  the TV sponsor for the tournament.  I guess it was all the members' wives wouldn't give them no pussy.  No.  I don't even know if that was a joke.  If it was, all right.  It's not like it.  It's not what y'all are thinking.  Everybody's putting too much shit into this,  and it's just a fucking decision to do this,  to let sleeping dogs lie.  I couldn't disagree with you more, Rich.  I think you're completely wrong.  You are so downplaying this.  There is a back story here. 
[01:09:30]  There's something we don't know about.  They were getting pressure for years,  and they finally gave into it.  And in a typical, because they're out-of-touch guy,  they think it's a big thing to let Condoleezza Rice  and this other high-profile woman in.  It's not like they let two just really good golfing women,  they picked the fucking ex-secretary of state.  Maybe they did that to, again, see, it's a black woman.  Maybe they did make a sarcastic statement,  but don't kid yourself.  They gave into fucking pressure, 
[01:10:00]  and maybe you don't want to look at them like  these are guys that would buckle, but they did.  Because you don't hold out for that long, dude.  You don't give up advertising one year  or pay it all yourself,  and then a few years later, I'll let women in.  You don't fight it that adamantly and that hard,  and then all of a sudden just have a change of heart.  They don't want women there.  And in a way, I hate them.  I don't like those type of guys,  but in a way, I kind of get it  because women will fuck up your good time. 
[01:10:30]  Well, you're damn right about that.  But if I can quote a great Oki and Anthony commentator,  let's disagree to disagree.  Ah-ha, he messed it up.  Oh, Rich.  Desegree to disagree.  Oh, Rich.  You fell apart there.  All right, Rich.  Enjoy your day.  We'll get a disagree to disagree.  Yeah, we'll disagree to disagree to disagree.  To quote.  Yeah.  To quote a great quote.  It's a good one.  To quote.  Quoter from the... 
[01:11:00]  I think they just gave in, man.  They got so much...  And you're right.  If the PGA threatened them,  if the PGA got that much pressure...  But if they didn't...  Something drastically changed within the last year.  Certainly, they're comfortable with the heat  they were getting over the years.  But they like to be...  Having the PGA...  That's a huge thing for the prestige of that place.  It's just seen as the ultimate elite place to play.  Don't tell me they don't care about that,  because they do.  That's what makes it so special to be a member.  How can this guy say the PGA has nothing to do with the Masters? 
[01:11:30]  Mike.  How you doing, buddy?  Hey, Mike.  Mike.  You're saying something wrong.  I don't know if you're getting your information from Uncle Paul or what,  but the PGA don't own the map.  Wait, wait.  Why would we get our info from Uncle Paul?  I'm a little confused by that, first of all.  Because I think Uncle Paul has been in locker rooms to get information.  I don't really understand that.  I don't know what he's saying, either.  Sir, I would make your point quick. 
[01:12:00]  But, you know, the Gus Nationals used to be all men now,  and they've got a whole bunch of Uncle Paul being in the locker room.  We get the Uncle Paul thing.  I'm sorry, please.  Please, for the love of God.  Wow.  Now, what do you mean the PGA has nothing to do with it?  Maybe you're right.  I don't know much about that.  The PGA doesn't own the Masters.  They don't own that tournament.  But the PGA could go,  this isn't going to be part of our tournament schedule anymore.  Let's put it this way.  Right?  If CBS has a tournament on TV, and they drop them, 
[01:12:30]  I promise you, ABC, NBC, ESPN would fight to get it.  They would, but not if there was enough pressure  from companies and advertisers and women's groups.  Then the other networks wouldn't take it.  Because the pressure from...  Dude, Letterman apologized after one sponsor dropped out.  It was an online sponsor.  I forget who it was,  for Embassy Suites or somewhere, 
[01:13:00]  after he did that Sarah Palin shit.  That puts pressure...  Everybody fucking moves  when the advertisers start threatening the wall.  I mean, Rush didn't,  but Rush groveled and apologized  after he said what he said,  once the advertisers started leaving.  Something else is going on here,  and I think,  kind of with Mike,  I don't know if it's PGA.  I don't think it is PGA pressure at this point,  but something big changed.  Well, it's IBM,  and the reason for that is  the CEO is a woman,  and last year there were issues  about her wearing a green jacket 
[01:13:30]  because the sponsors a lot of times  get to wear that as,  you know,  part-time members, essentially.  That's what they are down the term.  Yeah, supposedly,  if you're the CEO of IBM,  you get an automatic membership to Augusta, right?  And it turns out she was a female,  so that sort of changed everything  because they're like,  oh, fuck.  She's a female,  and we don't allow females.  So why then...  But then what happened there,  because I do know a little bit about that,  she doesn't play golf,  so it wasn't an issue issue.  The sales for merchandise, 
[01:14:00]  you talk about paying...  They don't need commercials  to run that golf course.  I mean, their merchandise,  they sell on-site,  pays for the tournament.  Pays for the tournament.  Sure, yeah.  Talking about the Bill Gates,  about him fighting to get in,  he tried to get in for years,  and they built a more exclusive club  about 25 miles away  from Augusta National.  But he's finally a member now.  So it's a hard place to get in. 
[01:14:30]  You know,  you see the stuff on TV  about the protest 10 years ago.  There's about 20 women out there with signs.  It wasn't 100.  That's just liberal bullshit.  Right.  I just have a hatred for these.  Somebody Twittered me something like,  you want to see progress,  let them say they've been a poor person.  Like, I get them.  I have such a hatred  for these type of guys anyway.  Yeah, of course.  They buckle to pressure of some sort.  Like, why does IBM automatically,  have they just been associated with it  for so long?  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:15:00]  So long.  That's why you finally see...  Think about it.  It's IBM.  Yeah.  That's how long it is.  Their name sounds outdated at this point.  Yeah.  But wait, IBM,  do they put a lot of money into Augusta?  Yeah.  Well, they put in, you know,  help run the term,  the background sort of stuff  with computers and stuff,  which, you know,  it's a big thing, you know,  to run any type of sporting event like that.  But, you know,  that's why now, you know,  with Bill Gates being a member,  that's why you got Tiger Woods PGA Golf 
[01:15:30]  on the video game.  That's why you have that now  called Bill Gates.  All right.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  You get a lot of this kind of stuff.  All right.  All right, Mike.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  A lot of people saying...  Thanks, Mike.  Thanks, Mike.  A lot of people saying  we're off with the whole PGA thing.  Maybe.  I agree.  I don't think it's PGA pressure,  but there's something here  we don't fully understand.  It's pressure from either a network  or IBM or other companies.  It is absolutely pressure  because they would never have just said, 
[01:16:00]  okay, why would they?  Why would they have fought it so hard  and then just went, okay,  right?  I remember when we had the...  I forgot what we called it,  but it was when the women  and the men played.  They had special days  where the women and men  played together.  Basically, you played with your wife.  Yeah, yeah.  And the guys that you just knew  really well from caddying  for a lot,  all of a sudden,  they're dressed a little differently  and they're being polite,  but they're giving you a look like...  Yeah.  You know. 
[01:16:30]  They're not fucking...  They're not talking about...  Mouthing off.  You know,  the hot fucking waitress  they saw the night before  or whatever the fuck it was.  Yeah.  Just guy shit.  Yeah.  And they're just being overly polite  and you can tell  they're just stiff out there.  Yep.  I don't know.  That's what happens.  It ruins it.  What's your take of this, man?  It fucking ruins it.  I think it ruins it.  I don't know anything about the rules.  Sponsors.  Do we sound like assholes?  What?  Do we sound like fucking  gentleman-a-sauruses?  Yeah, but why isn't anyone else in the... 
[01:17:00]  Why wouldn't anyone else in the media  just bring up the different animal?  It's so politically incorrect.  It's too scary?  It's so politically incorrect  to even suggest  that a woman  in a man's...  exclusive men's club like that  would fuck things up for the men.  Why?  So they can't act like animals anymore.  Because they have this impression  that men should be gentlemen all the time.  And if you tell a fuck joke  or talk about a woman's tits,  they get all fucking offended 
[01:17:30]  like it never happens  all the time  when guys are just hanging out.  Fuck them.  I say fuck them.  Yeah, but women have been  allowed to play there for years.  Play there?  Yeah.  Not become a member.  Yeah, but I mean,  is it really a big deal  that two women are now...  It's not like they're going to be there  every day.  It's a very big deal.  Yeah.  Because it just opens the door  for a shitload of men.  Yeah, but this is already  like a rich and exclusive club.  And then what it does,  it changes the culture  of the whole fucking thing.  Yeah, it is a big deal. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  I really do believe it's a big deal.  I think it's a big deal  in the sense that  they're finally allowing women  to be members,  but I don't think  it's going to change anything.  You think you'd get in Dr. Gay?  No.  Because of the gayness?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they just said,  you know what,  all right, fine.  Because if it wasn't going to happen...  But why?  You're right,  but for what reason  did they say that?  I think because  the chairman of Augusta 
[01:18:30]  now is much more  of a progressive person  than their former chairman.  Who's that cocksucker?  Hootie?  Who's that?  He's the old fucking  Hootie?  From the blowfish, dude.  Holy shit,  hole in one,  motherfucker.  Out, piggy.  No, no, wait a minute.  He's not a piggy.  I think last year  when he was being presented  with questions about this  because they're asked every year,  you know, he...  Well, how about this?  You could just tell 
[01:19:00]  that he was uncomfortable  with the entire situation.  But how about this?  Did the members  get to vote on this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I would say no they did not.  I don't know if members  get to vote on it.  I don't know if there's a board.  I guarantee this was not  a majority by the members themselves.  Who's the...  Billy Payne is the guy now.  Yes.  Who's the old guy?  Was it Hootie something?  Yeah, I forget his name.  I just had such a fucking...  Why did he drop out?  I hope because he's fucking sick.  I'm not sure.  But I just think  it was a progressive thing  where, you know,  if it didn't happen yesterday,  it was going to happen someday. 
[01:19:30]  It's not like they were  just going to keep going  for hundreds and hundreds of years.  It just wasn't.  Well, Travis,  we're going to have to  disagree to disagree.  We're going to have to  disagree to disagree.  We're going to have to  disagree to disagree.  Disagree to disagree.  You're the fucking...  What a dolt.  You know, you do it all  nice and quiet.  You don't...  You just...  Nice and quiet.  It's headline news.  Because the media  makes it that way.  They didn't hold a giant...  Of course they're going to.  They didn't hold a giant,  you know...  Of course.  They knew that  it would be headline news.  They didn't do it, like,  you know,  right before the Masters  or anything like that. 
[01:20:00]  The Masters?  Yeah, I don't...  I don't...  I don't know.  I think it's...  I don't know.  Fuck, I don't...  We don't need to always  be with each other.  Fuck him in a cunt.  Fuck him in a cunt.  Now, when it's closest  to the pin,  you can't say,  well, you know...  It's like,  cunt hair away.  You know.  Cunt hair away.  These are all  dumb guy things  on a golf course.  You look at the little thing 
[01:20:30]  they set up  for closest to the pin  and one asshole  always had to say,  one cunt hair.  One cunt hair.  And then, you know,  why don't you  take your skirt off?  Oh, that's a hostile environment.  Oh, look who's  waiting on the T.  We can't say that anymore.  You don't make it  past the T down there.  Dick out.  Dick out.  No, you can't do that.  No dick out.  Cunt out.  Hootie Johnson.  Oh, Hootie Johnson.  What a cunt.  Is that Hootie Johnson  on the phone? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  It's a really weird...  This is a weird issue  because I do agree  with the club  being able to do  what they want.  And it is annoying  because you know  sooner or later  something's going to happen  where it's like,  why are you there then?  The women are going to  complain about something  and they do fuck up  like a certain fund  you want to have.  There'll be drastic changes.  They will bitch about something.  It'll take a little time  but there will be  drastic changes.  And there will be  complaining.  Women love to complain. 
[01:21:30]  Right, guys?  They certainly do.  Can't live with them.  Can't live without them.  Is he the same one  that was the chairman  of Bank of America?  Look up Hootie Johnson.  Is that the one?  Is that the fucking caliber  or is it a different  Hootie Johnson?  How many Hootie Johnsons?  That's what I'm saying.  I'm going to make sure though.  Hoot, hoot.  Like was the chairman  of the Bank of America  the fucking...  So that's the caliber  of scumbag  that goes there.  Yeah.  The guy that runs 
[01:22:00]  the Bank of America...  Like how...  It's really hard for me  to side with them  on anything.  Man!  But I mean,  you know what I mean?  There's such pieces  of garbage.  Like I have such  a dislike for them.  Like you know  what this guy is.  Yeah.  You know what this guy is.  Hootie Johnson.  Yeah, he's just a cunt.  Hootie.  He's just a cunt.  Yeah.  What a hacker.  I don't know.  So why did he retire?  Again, like I said,  I hope it's for illness. 
[01:22:30]  I don't know.  Boot it out?  Yeah.  A golden parachute?  Yeah, he's the chairman,  retired chairman  of the executive committee  of Bank of America.  I'm sure he's a great guy.  Yeah, Sarah from Buffalo.  These guys are wrong  on the IBM CEO.  She specifically said  she doesn't give a shit  and would continue sponsorship.  That was an exact quote.  Okay.  No, she was like,  whatever.  This is not my issue.  I don't play golf.  I don't need to be a member there.  But I do.  As CEO of IBM,  I want to continue  my sponsorship. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, she didn't make  a big deal out of it.  I do remember that.  Not a big boss.  The media were trying  to push her into a,  you know.  Well, don't you want to be a member?  Yeah, they were trying  to push her into a position  and she was like,  look, it's not my issue.  I don't care.  I don't play golf.  No.  But these two fine ladies do.  A lot of people saying  you refused to accept  it wasn't on their terms.  It's not that we're refusing  to accept it,  but I think that people  are naive to think  that all of a sudden  they just changed their mind. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  That's all.  I want to know  who is announced to this one.  Is that when they finally  let blacks into  when they just all  had a change of heart?  Or there becomes  a certain social pressure  where it becomes  too much to bear anymore  and it's just like,  all right, fuck it.  It's not worth it anymore.  Are those people  part of Augusta?  I think they've let them in,  haven't they?  Those people.  Those people.  Don't you have homes? 
[01:24:00]  Jesus.  I would love a big fire  to break out.  I really would.  I would love a fire.  Love a fire.  You don't like the people  that are members there?  I despise them.  It sounds like a horrible place,  but in principle,  I don't understand  why women think  this is how you get equality.  There's a lot of powerful women  out there  and you could start  some pretty powerful  fucking things yourself.  Yeah.  That's what's weird.  There's two members  of a golf club now. 
[01:24:30]  It means nothing.  No, it means absolutely nothing.  Two?  Do you think  it's going to stop at two?  You asked if the members  got to vote on this  and you said probably not.  So then what does  their input matter  for anything?  It's Condoleezza Rice.  She's not sitting there  365.  Do you wear pennies?  No, I'm just saying  that I don't think  this is as big of a deal  as everybody's making it out to me.  Women have been able  to play there for years  and nobody said like,  oh, well, things have to change.  So what do you think  it is to change it?  I just think... 
[01:25:00]  Going with your point,  I bet you that the women  playing there for years  was a problem  for a lot of people there too.  Yeah, but nothing changed  because of it.  Well, no.  What changed was  now they're members  and I bet you  they don't want that.  We'll look back at this  in 30 years  and say you're right.  Nothing Did Change.  Because I'll tell you what,  if it wasn't a big change,  they would have just done it  years ago to shut everybody up.  If nothing was going to change...  That's a huge change.  Yeah, but who knows the...  That's why it's a huge story today.  I don't know what it takes to...  Hootie Johnson...  The guy who ran Bank of...  Yeah, Hootie Johnson 
[01:25:30]  is not going to approve it.  But does that not tell you  the cunt mentality  of the people that work there?  Oh, sure, absolutely.  Do you think that these fucking...  Not because they're rich,  but these are the elitist cunts  that would gladly parachute out  and let you fucking  drop dead starving?  These scumbags...  Do you think these scumbags  actually got together  and said,  let's just do something?  Come on.  No, but I think the guy  that's in charge now  had a much different view of this.  He may have.  He might be right.  And I mean, you could tell...  Like, people were asking him last year,  you know, 
[01:26:00]  what are you going to tell  your granddaughter about this?  And you could tell  that he was uncomfortable  with the entire situation.  So I think that he...  The pressure got to him.  Yeah.  Well, no.  I think that, you know,  his feelings carry a lot of weight  around there.  And maybe he had a different view  than Woody Johnson did  about all this.  I hope Woody Johnson...  Is he dead?  What are you going to tell  your granddaughter?  Woody Johnson.  No.  Hootie.  Tell your granddaughter,  you know,  you are equal  and go off  and do your own thing.  That's what?  I'm going to have a daughter soon. 
[01:26:30]  I'm going to not tell her  that she's the weaker species.  This doesn't prove  that you're equal.  What proves you're equal  is not giving a fuck  about what guys are doing.  There you go.  That's what makes you equal  in the end.  That's why guys do feel  fucking stronger at times.  Because we don't give a fuck  in the end  if you're part of a quilting club.  Yeah.  Or part of curves.  Bad mouth fucking...  Talk about cock  when you're doing that.  No one will give a shit.  If a guy's walking by  and a bunch of you broads 
[01:27:00]  are talking about cock,  we'll just fucking laugh.  Maybe get in on the conversation.  There you go.  Wave it around in your face.  Whatever it takes.  The second a guy  starts talking about  a woman's ass  or pussy or tits  and there's another woman around,  oh my goodness gracious.  That's what I'm going to tell my daughter.  Right.  She doesn't need to  fucking join Augusta  to be equal.  That's fake equal.  Correctamundo.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Phyllis Diller died.  We're going to talk about her next.  You're kidding!  She was beyond...  Where? 
[01:27:30]  ...hilarious.  Where?  That whole  women aren't funny shit.  Yeah.  And I think it is shit  at this point.  Yeah.  Phyllis Diller was  fucking just as funny  as any comic  that has ever lived.  Phyllis Diller.  There's a picture of her  in the paper  performing in Vietnam  and I'm looking at that  and she's wearing green shoes.  Door gunner?  What was she doing?  Mowing down some fucking...  Women and children!  You just don't lead them as much!  Yeah.  You just don't lead them so much.  But she's got like 
[01:28:00]  awful green shoes  and she's standing there  in front of the troops  in 67  and I realized  she was 50  when she was doing that.  50 and 67.  It's crazy.  Made it to 95  and she was  pretty much all there  right to the end.  What an amazing  fucking longevity.  That's so nice  to think  that you had  45 more years  after doing stand-up  in Vietnam.  That's fucking amazing.  I didn't mean to say  women are a different species.  I meant to say  that they're... 
[01:28:30]  I think they are, right?  Awkward.  You know what I was  trying to say,  don't you?  Of course.  I meant that they're...  What was I trying to say?  That they're fucking aliens.  They're fucking aliens.  They're fucking aliens.  People are fucking...  Their mouths are agape  right now.  Oh, you get what  I was trying to say,  don't you?  You crazy nutty broads.  But, you know,  sometimes you do feel  like they are  a different species,  right, guys?  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Sirius XM. 
[01:29:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm obsessing about Augusta.  I just want to go back  to it for a second.  Because things do change.  Like, in this new world  we live in,  guys just can't be guys.  They just can't.  Me and Ant  were talking a little bit,  you know,  we've had this discussion  many times,  but, you know,  the guy that works  at a machine shop  or a garage  used to just be a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're in the, 
[01:29:30]  you know...  And...  You're a mechanic.  You might have had  a dumb fucking calendar  where the girls  were dressed,  you know,  in bathing suits,  possibly,  I mean,  if you go back,  you know,  far enough,  it was just nudes.  Right.  And all that  is just taken away  because guys  are looked at as pigs  and we have to be controlled  and...  Hostile work environment.  Look at our dumb radio show.  We can't even look  at a nude picture  of a girl  on a computer  without completely 
[01:30:00]  shutting out  the light  that comes into the studio.  Yeah, we've got to  close all the fucking curtains.  Why is that?  That's curtains.  Why is that?  Why can't we just be guys  in a job, by the way,  that's way different  than most jobs?  Because if a lady  walks by and sees it,  oh boy,  lawsuits.  See what you said there?  Not a guy walking by.  Right.  You know,  but a lady  because a lady looks at us,  we're pigs  and we need to be controlled.  Yeah.  Even though we're...  In our case,  we're doing it for our jobs.  Believe it or not,  we're doing it for our jobs.  Like when Jimmy brought up 
[01:30:30]  that old porn star  from Taboo 2.  Jay Parker, yeah.  We had to close off  the studio  just so we could see  a picture of her  and go,  oh, her, okay.  Wasn't even worth it.  Hey.  If you ask me.  Hey, hey.  You know?  Yeah.  Going to work  used to be fun.  And I'm not talking about...  It's still fun to come here.  I'm talking about,  in general,  going to work  used to be fun.  Used to have shit  in your cubicle  that got you through.  Whatever it is.  Yeah.  And now we all know  what happens.  You can't have anything 
[01:31:00]  hanging up.  No.  It goes way beyond  a guy just being a guy.  And in a lot of cases,  in the end,  it has affected women as well.  Yeah.  It is fucking lame.  That's why...  And there's no turning back either.  You can't ever  be like,  hey,  we want to go back  to having fucking pinups  around the office.  I can only talk about  what I know,  which is radio.  So why is it  the company...  Why don't they have signs  like,  okay, look, 
[01:31:30]  we hired the Opie and Anthony show.  They're a bit edgy.  They do some nude shit.  They look at nude shit.  So if you're walking  by that studio,  be prepared.  You might get a glimpse  of something  on the computer.  Yeah.  Why is it that  we have to shut down?  Why is it that  we have to close  all our curtains and stuff?  Because they're afraid  of having to spend money  litigating some...  For the same reason,  they do other things  financially that they do  that you just go,  what the fuck is that about?  Right.  You just don't want  to spend the money.  It's always money, man. 
[01:32:00]  It's always...  And we bring this stuff up  because it goes beyond  what we do for a living  and everyone is affected  by all this shit.  You know?  Yeah.  But for some reason,  guys are looked at  as just fucking pigs  in general  and we need to be controlled  and we should not act  like guys at times.  Yeah.  Why?  But women could act like women  whenever they want.  And there's not a guy  that will go,  well, that's not right.  They shouldn't be allowed  to be women.  Yeah.  Why is it one-sided?  I don't get it. 
[01:32:30]  Double standard.  Double standard.  Go on.  Anyway, enough of that.  But I was just thinking  that, you know,  it's a weird environment.  I'm certainly glad  I sold my fucking Apple 600 calls.  Congratulations, Ant.  It was my August 21st,  which would have been  exercised today.  Right.  I had my Apple 600 call options.  And I got out 
[01:33:00]  exactly when it started ticking up.  And, uh...  If you kept it to today,  what would that happen?  I don't even want to think about it.  It's $665 now.  It's fucking...  No, it's pre-market.  Now it's $670.  It's $670.  Apple has just been named  the most valuable company  in history.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  And I fucking, uh...  Wait, so how much money  would you have made?  Could you give us a ballpark?  If you would have hung in there? 
[01:33:30]  It probably would have been  somewhere over $100,000,  I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So how much did you make  in the end?  I pretty much broke even  because I was panicking.  Oh, my...  I was panicking.  So I just got out  when I knew  I reached that point.  That's Citadel numbers.  Yeah.  I could have made up  for fucking Citadel,  that's for sure.  Why did you panic?  Because the fucking stock  was tanking.  For what reason?  What were the news?  Did they get a bad  earnings report or something?  They had earnings. 
[01:34:00]  It was under  what Wall Street said.  Their iPhone sales  were down,  but it was just because  people aren't buying  the iPhone now  because they're waiting  for the new one  to come out.  And everybody got  all fucked up  thinking it was because  of the Samsung phones  and the iPad sales  were good,  but they were like,  oh, things are slowing down.  Their forecast wasn't  as high as it has been  in the past.  It was all that shit.  So it fucking tanked,  and I mean tanked. 
[01:34:30]  And then I'm like,  oh, just please  get back where you were.  Please just get back  where you were.  I'll sell my options.  And I sold them.  And then it just  didn't stop climbing  like crazy.  Man.  It went from fucking  $575 a share  up to $600 and fucking  Man, $70.  $70, and it's, you know,  $100 a share.  Rockefeller said  you gotta buy  when there's blood  in the streets.  And it's like,  it's so hard to do that  because when the markets 
[01:35:00]  shit the bed  in L.A.  or whatever,  it's so scary  because, like,  when GM fails  or banks are closed,  like, banks were going,  that's a really hard,  it's like,  if GM fucking  goes bankrupt,  we're all fucking,  there's nothing,  that's safe.  Nothing is safe.  It's a situation,  I can make,  I can make Apple  go down today.  I'll make it lose money  today by buying  fucking options.  It will fucking,  it has been nothing,  it has been a juggernaut 
[01:35:30]  just going up every day,  but I swear to you,  if I buy call options  today,  it will fucking go down.  I'm just gonna wait  until they announce,  Is that the Kumiya law?  It is.  That's your own poster.  The Kumiya law.  If I buy fucking calls,  the stock will plummet.  If I buy put options,  the stock will climb.  Buy something today,  please,  I want to see if the  Kumiya law is in effect.  Please,  just anything.  I really am looking.  How much is an option,  and how much is a call,  I don't know anything  about that.  It all depends,  it all depends on what  the date of your, 
[01:36:00]  that it exercises on it,  it all depends on  the price of the option,  the strike price,  it's a lot of variables.  You could get some  cheap options if you,  if you buy them  where they're gonna,  they're gonna expire very soon.  You could also get cheap ones  that are way away  from the fucking price  that it is now.  By cheap,  how much?  You could get them  on fucking dollars  on the fucking share. 
[01:36:30]  You could leverage  fucking shares  for five dollars a share  if you want.  But how far in advance  would you have to bet?  What do you leverage share?  I don't know what that means.  It means you're,  you're getting  a virtual share  for a lot less money  than the actual share  would cost.  It's an option  to buy the share.  It's not really the share.  You're not even buying the share.  You don't own nothing.  But the ability to buy it  at a certain price,  that's what you're paying for.  It's like,  here's five bucks. 
[01:37:00]  I want the ability  to buy that share  for six hundred dollars.  And in order to give me  that wonderful ability,  I'm paying five dollars  for that.  And then,  no matter what the stock  goes to,  I could still buy the shares  at six hundred bucks.  So let's say it now  goes to six hundred and fifty dollars.  I said,  well,  I paid you five dollars  for the pleasure  of buying your stocks  at six hundred bucks.  So now I'm exercising  that thank you.  I buy it for six hundred.  Now I sell it for six fifty. 
[01:37:30]  And I make fifty bucks a share.  Okay,  you immediately sell it.  Yeah,  yeah,  you immediately turn it over.  Right.  Because you want,  you know,  you want to make some cash.  But if you don't,  if it sits the bed  and goes to a dollar ninety a share,  You are truly fucking,  You're just out on the five dollars.  You're out.  Your five dollars expires  on a certain date.  But only the five dollars.  You lose the five dollars.  But it's not like  you bought it for six hundred  and lost.  You only risked five.  Yes,  yes,  yes.  Okay.  Exactly.  I can make millions of it.  But it's never five  and it's never one share.  It's thousands. 
[01:38:00]  You have to buy a hundred.  No,  you have to buy ten.  I think,  what's the contract?  A hundred or ten?  Geez,  I forgot already.  I think it's ten.  How much would a six hundred  and a seventy dollar  Apple share be  to buy a put option for?  Or whatever the fuck it's called?  I don't know.  I'd have to look.  I would have to look.  Like roughly,  ten dollars or a thousand?  It depends.  If you buy it  at that price,  it would be  upwards of fucking  twenty-five  to thirty dollars  a share  depending on 
[01:38:30]  when the expiration time is.  What does that do  for the market?  Like,  that's such a gamble.  It's like,  it's such a way  to make money  off doing nothing.  Yeah,  I'm sure if somebody,  someone could explain it  as to what it really  is doing  in the market,  but it would be  a complete fucking  bore fest,  so I'm not even  going to get into it.  It's just a way  to get more action  going,  right?  And more money  going back and forth.  That's all.  It's a good indicator  on a stock.  You can look  at what the options,  what people are  buying options for, 
[01:39:00]  for like January,  let's say.  Let's say way  the fuck out.  January call options  at $750 a share,  and you're buying  those up,  betting that the stock  is going to go  that high.  It's kind of  an indicator.  If there's a fuckload  of those,  you can go,  wow,  I guess the stock's  going to go up.  So it's sort of  an indicator.  It's sort of  a confidence  in the stock.  I'm not sure  actually what it  does in paper,  but there isn't  a lot of real  viable, 
[01:39:30]  tangible paper  stuff going on  in the market  anyway.  It's all widgets  and fucking  credits and  markers and  quatluvs.  Yeah.  Nice.  But,  again,  I completely  shit the bed  on this Apple  stock.  Thank you.  Yeah,  I'm glad I bought  what I did.  I should have  bought it earlier,  but I'm glad  I bought what I did.  Oh,  you did?  Yeah.  You bought real  stock.  Oh,  yeah.  You're a good  man.  Wait,  you bought real  Apple stock?  A while ago,  yeah.  Fucking,  what,  like 10  shares?  That's great.  Nah,  a little bit more. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Fucking great.  Look at that.  Someone's great.  671 bucks a share,  up 580 in  pre-market,  you cocksucker.  Just because they  said it's the  greatest company  ever.  Right.  Today is good  news because it's  like,  ah,  great.  It's the only  reason.  Thank you very  much.  We got a  Hootie Johnson  quote,  Jimmy.  Bah,  hootah!  Because you're  obsessed with  Hootie Johnson.  I just have a  hatred of him.  He used to run  Augusta and now  he's gone and  now the new  guy,  you know.  Billy Hayes.  Or Billy,  not Billy Hayes,  Billy Payne.  Billy Payne,  I'm sorry.  Billy Payne.  Yeah,  Hootie,  by the way,  I hate him more  because he ran 
[01:40:30]  Bank of America.  Right.  But what about,  what was his  quote?  Hootie Johnson  was heard saying,  if I could change  and you could  change,  everybody could  change.  They all  change.  Fairways,  greens,  fairways and  greens.  The Twitter,  you know,  some agree,  some,  it's all over the  place.  Some agree,  some disagree,  and others don't  give a fuck.  Don't give a  flying.  What the fuck  Augusta does.  Don't give a  flying. 
[01:41:00]  I,  no,  go ahead.  I agree with  their right to  run a club the  way they want  to,  but I just  have,  I'm kind of  prejudiced with  such a,  just a,  a loathing.  You love that  it's going to  ruin their day.  Yeah,  in a way,  because I hate  them.  I get that part of it.  Fucking Jimmy's  prejudiced,  prejudiced against  golfers.  No,  I don't hate  golfers.  I hate,  you know,  golfers played  by a lot of  people,  but I just  hate those  fucking,  those people.  Yeah,  because you know  what they are.  You know what  they are.  So I get a big 
[01:41:30]  fire.  I hope it's an,  I hope electric,  like if there was,  you know,  there's no God.  If there was a God,  literally there would  just be a fucking,  a lightning strike  at Augusta and the,  and the whole thing  and the whole history  would burn.  Burn.  here's the dumb  thing about Augusta  too.  So now you got  women as members.  They,  women have been  playing there for  a while,  so they want to be  equal,  right?  Yeah.  So why the ladies  tease?  Why the ladies  tease?  Cause they're a  little weaker when  it comes to  driving those bulls. 
[01:42:00]  So that's not  equal,  equal.  That's sort of  equal.  That's equal,  but we need a  little help here.  You know what I  mean?  Yeah.  Where's that dumb  to?  Ah,  fuck them.  I say fuck  them.  Know who is a  legend?  Who?  Phyllis Diller.  Oh yeah.  She was a  legend.  Phyllis Diller.  She,  uh,  was one of the  funniest.  We just haven't  heard from her in a 
[01:42:30]  while cause she was  very old,  95,  but she was still  doing it.  Yeah.  She was still,  uh,  I believe performing  up until a few  years ago.  Yeah.  She kind of looked  like a robot  walking around  though.  Well,  you know,  95.  95.  She looked good  for 95,  man.  For,  for 90 or  whatever.  Anyone that isn't  laying on a silk  pillow looks good  for 95.  What do we know  about Phyllis Diller?  She,  she started her  stand-up career  in her 30s.  Uh,  nearly 40,  they're saying in  this article,  article.  40 years old.  She was a,  uh, 
[01:43:00]  she was a,  she was a housewife.  She had five  children.  Five children.  And she was an  advertising copywriter  at the time.  Women were a rarity  in the world of  stand-up comedy.  She goes,  you know what?  Fuck all this.  I want to be on  a stage,  uh,  telling jokes.  That's amazing.  She got a TV gig  at Oakland.  Uh,  her first job was  on the radio  and then her first  TV gig was a 15  minute show called  Phyllis Diller,  the homely friend  maker.  Oh.  And,  um,  I guess she started,  uh,  her stand-up career  in 55.  1955. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  In her late,  in her late 30s.  She was born in  1917.  So that is,  uh,  38.  38.  Wow.  38 she started.  But it's encouraging  when you look at,  like,  a career as a longevity.  I'm 44.  So she was only  six years into her  career when she was  my age.  Like,  I'm 21 years in.  She was only six  years in.  And then fucking  had a 60-year career,  almost 60-year career.  She was on all the  talk shows.  She had that TV,  that animated TV show,  uh,  Really? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah,  what was the name?  Ah,  ah,  ah,  ah.  She would do that  laugh,  wouldn't she?  She had a great laugh.  Uh,  my husband,  Fang.  Fang.  How do you know that?  I remember watching her  on like Ed Sullivan.  And she said that  that was based on,  that wasn't based on  either of her husbands.  Really?  Yeah.  She's probably saying  that,  but.  We got her from  Ed Sullivan.  Based on Flip Wilson.  Want to hear her on  Ed Sullivan?  Yeah.  Uh,  sure.  Back in,  uh,  1992,  I believe.  I thought Sullivan died. 
[01:44:30]  There you go.  What year was that?  Was she on Family Guy,  too?  What?  Was she the voice of  somebody on Family Guy?  Really?  That would be crazy.  Why would we have  info on her today?  Oh.  Why would we?  Oh,  boy.  What do you mean  we didn't have  all this info?  Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha.  You got it  pretty good,  man.  Will you decide  I'm going to guess  65 or 66? 
[01:45:00]  Well,  what did we prepare  for the big  Phyllis Diller,  uh,  passing?  I got this.  I got two paragraphs  on her.  What else we got  on her?  We had some audio  which we requested  during the break.  Yes.  What else?  I got the IMDB up.  Oh,  cool.  You guys are too young  to think that Phyllis Diller  was a massive...  She was a legend.  She was on Family Guy.  She was,  see?  Peter Griffin's mom  or something?  Thelma Griffin.  Yep. 
[01:45:30]  Pretty cool.  She's the voice of  Peter Griffin's mom  or grandma,  something.  She's on Robot Chicken,  too.  Robot Chicken.  I like that Robot Chicken.  Are you making new ones?  Oh, yeah.  Uh,  I met her with,  um,  what do you know  about Phyllis Diller,  Sam?  Did it even cross your mind  that this was a biggie?  Yeah,  I mean,  I know who she is.  Um,  I mean,  she's just one of those  iconic people  that I don't know  from anything in specific,  though.  She's always been  a Phyllis Diller's character.  Come on. 
[01:46:00]  Do you care about Phyllis Diller?  I knew her from  Johnny Carson  and Old Game Shows.  Oh,  Was she on the game show  or is it?  Yeah,  she used to do,  uh,  which ones?  Match game?  I think she did  the pyramid,  match game.  She did everything.  Hollywood?  Hollywood squares.  Yeah.  Yeah,  yeah.  I think she sat  underneath that,  uh,  that Quay,  that Quay,  uh,  Paul Lind.  There's a picture  in the paper  of her with, 
[01:46:30]  uh,  I forgot about those names,  like,  I just remembered  him the other day.  Yeah.  Used to call someone a,  you're a Quay.  Don't be Quay.  Don't be a Queeb.  I never heard of that.  And it was like,  because it was queer  and gay.  Right.  So it was,  don't be Quay.  And Queeb was just like  a queer and a fucking,  I don't know,  something.  Maybe Jewish.  One of her famous lines,  had been chasing down  a garbage truck  and asking the driver  if she was too late.  No,  he replied,  jump right in. 
[01:47:00]  That's pretty funny.  That's pretty good.  Jump right in.  Well,  here's Phyllis Diller  from the Ed Sullivan Show.  Troy Kwan,  what do you know  about Phyllis Diller?  Oh.  Nothing.  There was a rap song  I liked that.  It had Phyllis Diller  reference in it,  but that's all I know.  What the fuck happened  to your hair, dude?  Yeah, what are you doing?  I'm switching it up.  You're switching it up?  Wait,  what are you doing?  Did you just  grow hair overnight?  No,  it's not really pompadoured.  Look at that fucking hair  on this guy.  Yeah,  but he's combing it over. 
[01:47:30]  Oh,  you're combing it to the side  instead of all the way back?  Isn't that funny?  He's got a full head of hair  with a comb over.  I'm combing it  just sort of backing over.  Yeah,  back into the left.  Is there even a hint  you're losing your hair  at this point  now that you're close to 40?  Oh,  Jesus.  I'm not 40.  I was born in 1977.  Holy fuck.  Isn't that a great head of hair?  It's like a devil.  Holy fuck.  How can one man  have so much hair?  Yeah,  that's some great hair  genealogy right there.  It's a devil's luck.  That's kind of what I'm going for.  Yeah,  yeah,  okay.  What do you do with it? 
[01:48:00]  Spiking right down the front.  Switch it up,  like I'm doing.  Switch it up a little.  Comb it to the side.  You've got to keep it fresh.  He can do whatever he wants.  You know what I mean?  He's one of those guys,  too,  that could just take his hands  and swipe it right through his hair  and he's good to go.  He's not in trouble  for not knowing  who Phyllis Diller is  because he's not losing his hair?  Who gives a shit?  What a great head of hair  on this kid.  What rap song had Phyllis Diller?  Beastie Boys?  No,  it was Bloodhound Gang.  Do you remember that one,  Eric?  What was the one?  He's like,  something,  something,  Phyllis Diller.  I don't remember.  That's all I know.  That's it,  huh?  I know.  There it is. 
[01:48:30]  She is an old broad.  She's a legend  and that's all you know about her.  Yeah.  It proves time.  It just takes everyone.  I don't really like movies anyway.  It takes away everything  you think is important.  She wasn't really  in a lot of movies  I don't think, right?  Was she?  Yeah, I don't know why.  She didn't really do  a lot of movies.  What movie was she in there?  Sam Roberts?  Name the biggest movie  she was in.  Probably way back.  A Bug's Life.  Oh, she was in A Bug's Life.  Oh, right.  She was one of the  buggy things.  I was a bug.  Was she the Queen Bee?  Yeah, she was.  She was the Queen. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  She was on Scooby-Doo.  Yeah, and Animaniacs  and King of the Hill  and the Wild Thornberries  and Hey Arnold.  How about a movie  she was in from  like back when she was  more in her prime?  Scroll down to the 60s  and 70s.  There you go.  Wow, I don't know.  Oh, she was in  Love American Style.  Oh.  Love, love, love.  I don't know if any  of these movies  were big movies anyway.  She was on Chips.  What's that?  Oh, fuck.  Fuck. 
[01:49:30]  I knew it.  Fuck.  Pink Motel.  Oh, Ponch and John  and stuff.  Yeah, what are you  getting pulled over  or something  for drunk driving  into a person?  It's fucking great.  Oh, I mean Chipson.  Double wheels cannon.  Dr. Hackenstein.  Yeah, I don't really.  Or the Boss Story.  Oh, fuck.  Someone know  what her biggest movie was?  The Perfect Man.  She wasn't really  in a lot of movies.  Yeah, she was  more of a TV personality. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  And a huge stand-up.  And here she is  on Ed Sullivan.  Thank you, thank you,  thank you very much.  You think I'm overdressed.  This is my slip.  I got a figure  that just won't starch.  My body's in such bad shape  I wear prescription underwear.  I finally had a ship  tattooed on my chest.  I wanted something on it.  Would you believe  that I once entered  a beauty contest?  I must have been  out of my mind.  I not only 
[01:50:30]  came in last.  I got 361  get well cards.  I don't want you  to get the idea  that I have given up  on my looks.  I will never give up.  I am in my 14th year  of a 10-day beauty plan.  When I go to bed  at night  I've got so much  grease on my body  I wear snow chains  to hold up my gown.  We've got more  grease stains  in the bedroom  than we've got  in the garage.  One night  I asked Fang 
[01:51:00]  to kiss me goodnight.  He got up  and put on his work clothes.  You know the lights  have gone out  with dirty old Fang.  The last time  there was a gleam  in Fang's eye  there was a short  in his electric blanket.  For a second  the way they had  to talk back then  the way she could say  that my husband  doesn't fuck me  the lights have gone out  on old Fang.  It's the only way  she could reference  not getting fucked.  Old Fang needs  a pasty back. 
[01:51:30]  I think Joan Rivers  couldn't say  pregnant when she  was on that celebrity.  He was real tight.  I don't need you  ruining my shoe  with this dirty talk.  Let's be honest  she was overrated.  Let's move on.  Oh Jesus.  It was a different time Sam.  I thought she was  a legend.  She is.  She is.  Are you laughing at this?  No.  Why?  I don't know.  I didn't think it was  I mean I guess it was  funny at the time.  It's very timely.  Yeah I didn't think  it was funny in 2012. 
[01:52:00]  It's enjoyable  to listen to  like in a nostalgia way.  Like I can admire it.  Like I won't laugh  out loud at it  but I still admire it.  There's very few  old things from  Ed Sullivan  I'll actually laugh  out loud at.  This doesn't seem  like it's her  in her prime though.  It seems like it's  more when she was  first starting out  or something.  No this is her  probably right in the middle.  She said Fang  so I think that they  knew who she was  by then.  Oh Fang.  All he cares about  is football.  I thought that our  weekends after we  were married would be  a loaf of bread  a jug of wine  and laugh. 
[01:52:30]  You know how it  turned out?  A box of pretzels  a can of beer  and the Green Bay Packers.  You wouldn't believe  the way this man  boozes.  He can kill a six pack  during an instant replay.  His breath is so bad  the dentist works on him  through his ears.  That's a great line.  He's such a coward  when I take him  to the dentist's office  they have to strap him  in the chair  give him a shot 
[01:53:00]  of Novocaine  and a balloon.  That's in the waiting room.  That's probably not  our best TV set  but the cadence  and what was  considered appropriate  is just so different  in the 60s  than it is now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so weird.  It's like  The cadence was different.  She was having  a decent set there.  She wasn't killing.  She was probably  having like a seven there  but you know 
[01:53:30]  the cadence  and the vernacular  and everything about it  is so different  than what is  considered good today.  The audience  all in suits  and ties  and dresses.  Like we see things coming  like when she goes  it was a this  I thought it was  going to be  a loaf of bread  a bottle of wine  and blah blah blah  instead it's  pretzel  boom in the pot  like that's something  now you probably  wouldn't do that 
[01:54:00]  in that way  because it's such  an obvious  yeah  but you know  again this is  after 50 years  of television  since she did this  yeah  and I got  more rhymes  than Phyllis Diller  oh yeah  I got more rhymes  than Phyllis Diller  I told you  it was Beastie Boys  it was Beastie Boys  I got more rhymes  than Phyllis Diller  there you go  I knew it  she didn't have many rhymes  how does he not know  the Beastie Boys  he says it's his favorite group  he doesn't know anything  time to get ill right  is that the one he rocked 
[01:54:30]  you want more Phyllis Diller  from an unknown TV appearance  from the 60s  unknown  let's give it a shot  sure  thank you  thank you  thank you very much  how do you like my legs  I'm so sick of having  bird legs  you know  I was in an elevator  the other day  and some ugly broad  looked at me  and she said  the last time  I saw a leg like that  there was a message attached  I feel like  I ought to spread out  a bunch of newspapers  and work on top of that 
[01:55:00]  it's a much better set  you know  I feel as long as you got  bird legs  you might as well  wear them in a cage  you know the problem  these mini skirts  what in the world  is happening  with fashion  if skirts get any shorter  I'm gonna have to have  my legs fixed  they don't go all the way up  and let's face it  you're showing me a mini skirt  is strictly mini  ha ha  oh Jesus  you know all you wear  for a slip under these things  is a long line bra 
[01:55:30]  you know we used to laugh  at those ads  I dreamed I went shopping  in my maiden form bra  I got news  we're doing it  I can just see it now  Mabel  bring me my street bra  the one with the buttons  if it weren't for the buttons  I wouldn't have any shape at all  we're probably the only woman  in America  with two backs  fucking hilarious  Jesus  that's very funny  this is her in her prime  I'm telling you  that first set 
[01:56:00]  you could tell  that was different  she found her voice here  she was probably  at least ten years in  that first set  which wasn't a great set  yeah  what were the years  of Ed Sullivan  and don't forget  she might have been nervous  too it was Sullivan  I mean  what were the years  of Ed Sullivan  you know Ann about  uh  I believe it was  early 60s  I'm gonna say  67 to 72  Beatles  I'm just guessing  you gotta think Beatles  Beatles were  65 to 72  63 to 72  76  what year 
[01:56:30]  Sam  find the years  before I bite your fucking arms  I think you might have  started in the 50s  late 50s  no I don't think so  I might be wrong  I think he's a guy  in the 60s  but you are right  she was well into her career  she had a few years  under her book  but this sounds  way more like her voice  than I remember  one is just a better set  she's really killing  but I'm thinking of  all the laughs she's getting  like she's getting  fucking four laughs  for every one of my  boring setups  she really is  fucking hammering  how long was it on  fucker  uh 
[01:57:00]  1948  what  come on  was that radio  wow  to 1971  so  so  that might  we don't know  when that was  well how about  that had to be radio  Phyllis Diller on Sullivan  Phyllis Diller  what year was that  for Matt Sullivan  it was on the CD  1969  69  so she was 14 years in  48  14 years in  so she was  1917  42 years old  no  52  no  she was 52  for that set  well she  yeah  she was  for 1917  what year was that 
[01:57:30]  1960  okay so she was 52 years old  and she was 14 years into her career  wow  on that Sullivan spot  she was having a decent set  not a great one  not a bad set  but decent  wow  it's totally different than the one we're hearing now  yeah it's just a business  it's a better crowd  I'm pretty sick and tired of having my bras  come back from the laundry march  flat work  these old fucking  like  how do you feel about an A-cup  and I know I'm the only woman in America 
[01:58:00]  over 40 still wearing a training bra  that's killing  the tip material  but my husband is usually absolutely no help  because you know he boozes  oh  Kelly how do I tell you  he gets so high  he won't drink without a net under him  in fact  he thinks he's royalty  because everybody's always talking about his highness  he's high  oh his highness 
[01:58:30]  wow  wow  he spent one night in the front yard  trying to kill a garden host  and I know very well  he is the only man in America  who ever tried to swim  in the Pennsylvania turnpike  I think he would have made it  except for the white line  wow  yeah you can see like a lot  like a way of getting to something  that's the only something in America  who  it's weird to like  listen to old comics  get to 
[01:59:00]  get  use certain things  to get to where they're going  yeah yeah  and that's interesting to hear  like  you know the only person in America  but I guess back then  that was just  the way you would stress something  the way you do it  yeah  it's fucking weird too  she was murdering though  she was fucking murdering  and the old references are hilarious too  yeah  flat iron  flat iron  but there was no  there was no  sexual innuendo allowed  no  like as much as  we think PC stinks  back then man  you couldn't fucking hint  that you were taking a dick  that bra shit was 
[01:59:30]  cutting edge  yeah  she's talking about her tits  it's crazy  yeah  crazy back then  I saw a negro  drinking out of the white water fountain  yeah  it left for so big  that we were tripping on  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  Sam funny  no I mean I recognize  that the titty jokes are funny  but oh  yeah  what do you find funny Sam  I don't know  you guys didn't laugh either  I was watching you  I did enjoy it  you did  watch me motherfucker  I didn't really laugh  I did enjoy it though  like that's one you'll enjoy 
[02:00:00]  I'll enjoy that like  if I hear a song I like  I don't always get up and fucking  and dance to it  I enjoy the nostalgia of it  yeah  and I recognize she was great  you know  she really was fucking hilarious  I mean  to kill like that on TV  yeah  in you know  in 67 with those restrictions  it's just awesome  it's amazing  uh  speaking of nostalgia  I found a very cool app  I'd like to share  ooh  with everybody  ooh  if you're like me  uh  somebody who uh  enjoys um  nostalgia  uh  uh 
[02:00:30]  I like television  I grew up um  watching a lot of it  did ya  I did  there's uh  an app called  video time machine  and uh  all you do here  look  you  you scroll through the date  and let's say I just put  1975 in there  uh  and then  and then you put  it's all  or movies  or music  or TV  or news  sports  there's a bunch of little categories  games  uh  and then you scroll through it  there's just a shitload of clips 
[02:01:00]  from like  here's a movie  uh  trailer from um  uh  what is that  Dr. Manx  what the hell is that  movie trailer for Dog Day Afternoon  and it's the original theatrical movie trailers  um  a  1975  Buick Riviera  uh  commercial  it's just cool shit  I would say  and it's addicting  you just kind of sit there  and uh  over um  a few hours  you just go through all these  ancient fucking videos  sounds stupid  it's cool 
[02:01:30]  it's pretty goddamn cool  I'd say  who's that Aaron Paul  on fucking  on um  Price is Right  on Price is Right  yeah that  that hit last week  it's four thousand dollars  bitch  can you put in like uh  Phyllis Diller or something  um  in the search  or do you have to just go  through the year  there's no search  it's just kind of  you can weed it out  but there's  there's sports  and video games  but how do you search for stuff  you just go through it  no you don't search  have some fun  can you do like  today's date  in 19 
[02:02:00]  no  no  you just go through the date  what a piece of shit  it's great  you know what  let me tell you what  look Charo  doing uh  a song  let's hear Charo  do a song  yeah how about we don't  I was  a bubble yum commercial  from 1977  I mean it's just one of those  things that are kind of cool  spider eggs  I want to hear that  spider eggs  bubble yum  yeah  bubble yum  let's see  what the fuck  let me see  what's this  well you're really selling  this app 
[02:02:30]  it'll go  keep opening your arms  they were very big on jingles 
[02:03:00]  I got thrown out of the library  one time for that  I said how long  and she went this long  and I put my fingers in  I'm like here's your bubble yum  bubble gum  chewy chewy  and everybody went  shush Paul  exactly  I think we could put some beeps  in that fucking commercial  probably could  make it sound like it's  like it's a shit  talking about cock  uh one thing I found on here though  that is really  I've just been captivated by it 
[02:03:30]  is the Brady Bunch variety hour  alright  this is uh  from 1977  I guess  um  uh  the Brady Bunch  uh people  they decided they were gonna  take the Brady Bunch  and for some reason  put them in space  this just  no I  that would have been more  plausible  for some reason  they decided  the Brady Bunch people  who were just  you know  remember the Brady Bunch  everybody does  uh  they were gonna make them  have a variety show  and do  the corniest  variety show  songs  and  these schmaltzy 
[02:04:00]  fucking  big production numbers  when none of them  could sing  or dance  or anything  and it was under the guide  like Alice would come out  and she's stirring a pot  of something  and she'd be like  oh Greg  Greg  it's your turn  to sing something  like it made no sense  so let's get a clip or two  it made no sense  and uh  yeah  it was  it was horrible  and they would sing songs  like um  uh  Marsha  singing  Time in a Bottle  and it's so  utterly 
[02:04:30]  bad  so basically  they're getting the songs  of the time  saying hey  you sing this now  and you sing it  and Mr. Brady  was singing  Bottle in My Colon  if I could have  a bottle  in my colon  the first thing  that I'd like to do  is sip some broth  yeah here it is  second half  of the Brady Bunch hour  if you're walking backwards  stay tuned for the first half  ah  I get it  and now um  hi  see look there she is  well  Greg's back home now  we're gonna have 
[02:05:00]  a little party for him  but you'll find out  about that later  it makes no sense  in the meantime  everything's back to normal  Mr. and Mrs. Brady  are smiling  oh boy  kids are all fighting  over the bathroom  Mr. Brady  seems like everybody  wants to take a shower  at the same time  someone wants to get  cleaned up in it  the rest want to sing in it  she still likes  one of the Brady kids  is going to graduate  from the shower  ladies and gentlemen  Marsha Brady  it's not Marsha Brady  this is so bad 
[02:05:30]  listen to all the effect  on her voice  I could save time  in a bottle  the first thing  that I'd like to do  and it's just  like they're doing  the slow camera pushing  through some flowers  that are on stage  it looks like  the worst  type of television  this is lovely  Marsha Brady  is very good 
[02:06:00]  alright enough of this  get one with all  the kids are singing  like a disco  get the disco one  disco medley  I think it's called  there it is  fuck yeah  well we're ready  to do the introduction  to the finale  where are the kids  oh he's wearing  a sequined shirt  of course  we always do this  with the kids  scream bitch  dancing disco songs  and they didn't  figure they'd have  enough energy  for the introduction  too  look how gay he is  well sure  what makes the kids  think we've got 
[02:06:30]  the energy  to do this introduction  he's got no energy  to do anything  exactly  feeling a little  tired on you  I just want to  lay under an afghan  all day  have the heat on  in summer  maybe they're wrong  and then they  look at how bad  this is  we can't  I know  well  you can find it  but they have  like a dance troupe  and they got  big multicolored  afro wigs on  isn't this turn  to beat around  yes  oh no  wait till you see  the bravies  come out and sing it

[02:07:30]  and she is the only one  that actually could sing  a little bit  cause they hired her  just because she could sing  look at the bad dance  they're doing these  weird moves  that  it's like  from the Brady Bunch  when they were doing  those dumb dances  oh my god  they're all off  from each other  oh  who's that  oh Mrs. Brady  oh it's a medley  oh uh oh  how is this disco

[02:18:30]  fucking heinous it's so bad how did any of them feel good about themselves yes  the big number he loved doing these song and dance things they probably would do a comedy sketch

[02:30:30]  what the fuck's going on  so  two kids uh  historically crying  after seeing disney's new movie  the odd life of timothy green  which one is this  with the dead kid right  he's got the leaves  on his ankles  it's fucking creepy  i saw the preview  yeah i don't like that  because i took my kid to see  um  and we know some of the people  in this movie  but it has to be said  i didn't like the ice age movie  sam roberts  i did not like it  it was better than part three  and my kid didn't like it  well your kid's like two  he's not a movie creator  yeah but all the fucking movies  held his attention for a while 
[02:31:00]  not this one  he wandered around  globally the movies  made as much money as batman  i did not like it  thank god you're not  the american public  whoa  what was it  what's the name of the latest  ice age movie  uh  continental drift  something like that  ice age four  lorax kept his attention  lorax hasn't made half the money  that uh  i didn't like guys  no one likes lorax  exactly lorax is stupid  why is it stupid  it's a dumb movie  plus there's not an original thought  put into it  because it was based on a book  and it just looks like the illustrations 
[02:31:30]  in the book  nice  it's a dumb movie  you didn't like lorax in it  i didn't see it  why would you  it's dumb  why are you assuming  because it's dr seuss right  yeah  dr seuss was very overrated  very stupid guy  i think he was overrated  stupid guy  very stupid guy  yeah  his architecture  was just not practical  no  no  he didn't know how to build anything  everything's tilted  and had a good foundation  to it  yeah  it was stupid  i didn't like dr seuss growing up  it was dumb 
[02:32:00]  now the movies are dumb  i would crack up reading that stuff  except  ham and salmon and all that stuff  that rhyme pretty good  oh  like uh  green eggs and ham  yeah  sam i am or something  i would not eat green eggs and ham  have some ham motherfucker  not eat them sam i am  what about cat in the hat  uh  nah i don't like cat in the hat either  i did  silly  cat had a big bunch of hats on  you're like what's in there  you like anything with a hat  horton hears a who  was a good animated  that sounds like norton  isn't that what it was  i always noticed 
[02:32:30]  horton hears the who  and like he starts crying  by the photogs  absolutely crying  horton hears the who  horton hears the who  horton hears the who  absolutely crying  through your tears  yeah  oh fucking  horton hears the who  substitute 
[02:33:00]  like the who  jimmy don't like the who  they're okay  i like the who  i don't do as tired  like the who  where's bill burr  i'm absolutely crying  i can't help it  i really can't  this is no fake  you know the whole moment  just kind of  can i can i can i can i put some  perspective on this clip  that's coming out of nowhere  too much fucking perspective  the guy that is involved with  this clip  george taylor  morris one of the great 
[02:33:30]  voices of radio  for real  i would assume at this point  he knew he had cancer  george taylor morris  unfortunately is no longer  with us and he was always  good to us  he's dead  he's dead  you're kidding  he did reeling in the years  for those people that  heard that syndicated  program  yeah  he is part of this clip  a tough guy  a real guy  a man's man  who probably knew  he already had cancer  and he's not crying  cancer 
[02:34:00]  and this fruit  fruit  what were they called again  the jocca  the jocca  oh oh yeah  do you have one of those  i know we  when was the last time  we did this baby rock  tell me  tell me  this one could be a while  all right good  yeah  when we first got to  satellite radio  this guy  and i forgot his name  bruce kelly  bruce kelly  i like bruce  bruce kelly  the 80s child  but he wanted to be part  of the whole oh and eight 
[02:34:30]  thing so badly  that he came up  with this concept  ocular  interloculars  do you have an example  of one of bruce kelly's  interloculars  interloculars  remember these  and he would interview  all like the people  that were involved  with the show  like bob kelly  remember  was in  yeah that's the one  i have here  bob kelly  all right let's listen  to the bob kelly one  oh and a  yeah  opi and anthony  are overpaid  but you know  then again  so is  they are really 
[02:35:00]  lucky to have a job  the worst  of oh and a  hi bob kelly  he's one of the  opi and anthony  virus freaks  and they're coming  to get him right now  what's happening man  how do you feel  oh and a now  on xm  and totally uncensored  totally free  right  you're a stand-up comedian  how does that  let you loose  here on oh and a  it's fantastic  i'm so glad  they're free  now i just want to know  do i get my two bucks  back for the last  eight months  but yeah it's fantastic  it should be free  more people get to  listen to these uh 
[02:35:30]  these uh two gentlemen  opi and anthony  uh get more fans  and then they can  take over the world  i think that's their  plan and be number  one in the universe  why do you like being  a part of the o and a  show  because they have uh  they're the best fans  in the world  they have the best fans  no i'm just kidding  they don't  their fans are evil  atrocious creeps  but that's why i love  them o and a  because they're the  best  they're the best  they get to say  what you want  they're the funniest  thing on the radio  the absolute truth  you get to say  what you want  about uh  fucking a sink  where else could i  tell people  that i fucked a sink  that was a dream 
[02:36:00]  which show will i  be able to tell  do you think this  is a good  in our audience  the fcc  and censorship  on the radio  i think that uh  satellite radio  is uh  the new cable  you know  like cable television  man  you finally get to  hear what people  really think  and uh  yeah  die  i hate you  terrestrial radio  shows i've done  and had to talk  about how my  drowned fishing  misleading  i actually told  one time i told  this story when i  was in juvie  how i used to  fuck a sink  i get a lot of  emails now  about people 
[02:36:30]  and they  think i actually  fucked the sink  that's what you're  doing you walk  which is physically  impossible  i actually  just lied  on top of the  sink  put my hand  on the edge  of the sink  i don't remember  the interloculars  being  i thought they  were quick  inside of my  hand  and the sink  all it was  was leverage  you want to  call interlocular  because you  want to lock  your ears  in a fucking  vault  if you listen  to one  so that guy  bruce kelly  eight months  you know  i think  it was  2005 
[02:37:00]  ish  that's  wow  that clip's  like seven  years old  that's crazy  that's sad  and uh  so bruce kelly  was at a who  show  what was it  live  and  xm was  broadcasting  the whole thing  and then  right after the  who set  he had this  to say  is this live  yes we're live  bruce where were  you buddy  i was right up  under the  phone logs  you know  it's amazing  watching p townsend 
[02:37:30]  and roger daltrey  perform these songs  after all these years  and still have the  the full spirit  of what they do  under control  i mean you know  townsend just  continues to be  an amazing guitar player  i'm sorry  i'm absolutely  crying  i can't help it  i really can't  this is no fake  you know  the whole moment  just kind of  kind of got to me  with that video  yeah the video  was very powerful  yeah  yeah that was  uh  that's uh 
[02:38:00]  this is very awkward  i'm sorry  but uh  it was just  i mean  you know  it's just a who  you know  i can't help  but be a 14 year old  kid out there  with the who  and that's it  i'm sorry  you were seeing them live  i guess that was in color  yeah  yeah uh  yeah they were live on stage  but the black and white  was happening on the big screens too  so uh  through your tears  well  so there's uh  two more  she hates his weakness  you think  through your tears  you fucking faggot  you wanker  through your tears 
[02:38:30]  i left the who show  with two bad tear ducts  no fake  no fake  18 years ago  i left Dayton, Ohio  with two very bad knees  oh no  yeah  yeah  it's the end of the clip  and a dream to become  a major league baseball player  my big god  this dream came true  dream  dream  oh god  let's say hi to  Bill Burr everyone  Bill Burr 
[02:39:00]  hey what's going on  that clip is  the only thing that makes me laugh  about that clip  is the first time  you guys played it  and i watched  and i'll be just  the second  mike schmidt starts crying  he just goes  he just goes  oh boy  yeah  what are you gonna do  it's not that he cries  it's that his voice  goes up so high  that's what killed it for me  yes  because he was known  as a tough guy  mike schmidt  wasn't he  mike schmidt 
[02:39:30]  could still beat the crap  out of all of us  absolutely  that's the one thing  we have over him  absolutely  he cried like a little girl  he loved the game  everybody  hey Bill  do you have anything  on the Augusta situation  with the women  being let in  what happened  oh you don't  at Augusta  Augusta finally  allowed two women  to join the club  after all these years  after 80 years  well you know what  how about a round of applause  for Augusta  keeping it real  all the way to 2012 
[02:40:00]  you know  it's not hard  to keep the ladies  you know  it's not easy  to keep the ladies  out that long  oh my god  hi Bill  did I lose you  hello  yeah I don't know  what happened there  what happened  no I was just  looking at Apple stock  and I'm fucking annoyed  yeah it's very annoyed today  yeah I punched out  of Apple at 600  nice  Bill  I saw your special  hello  hello  fucking 
[02:40:30]  it was fucking hilarious  of course it was  fucking hilarious  why do you even need  to promote this  at this point  it's on Netflix  because people need it  well because you know why  because it's only on Netflix  yes  but it's amazing to me  that people don't know  that A you're hilarious  and that the special's out there  it's on Netflix  what is it called  it's called  you people are all the same  right right right right  right that's right  yeah  god damn funny man  yeah well I don't know  I figured I'd call in  and promote it 
[02:41:00]  but evidently that was  a dumb thing to do  no  no I didn't mean it  like that  I feel bad for you  that you still gotta  promote your ass off  because you know  people should just  know at this point  it was kind of a compliment  believe it or not  oh alright  I think we're all  distracted because we  we want to know  about  Sandra Bullock  oh the gossip  that's going on  Bill  let's tell you  something you guys  if that was even  remotely true  you don't think  you would have known  before that stupid 
[02:41:30]  thing wrote it  I don't know  there wasn't  one word  of truth  and I don't even  think at that point  she when that thing  came out  she even knew  my name  but apparently  you guys  I had a part  in the movie  where I played  Melissa McCarthy's  family  and there's like  seven of us  so we did one scene  they both come in  and there's all  seven of us  you know 
[02:42:00]  doing whatever  the hell we're supposed  to do in the scene  you know  you know  it's like when you  go to a party  and you mean  this is Joey  this is Mike  this is Phyllis  you know  by the time you  go around the room  you don't remember  anybody's name  that's basically  where it was at  but Sandra's  friends are worried  because you're  a bad boy  yeah  no it said  friends are fearful  oh fearful  right  fearful  I was reading it  laughing my ass off  I was howling  and apparently  wasn't there  stuff going on  like behind the scenes  you were throwing 
[02:42:30]  stuff at each other  and making jokes  I threw some Doritos  and then they threw  apples at me  like full on apples  they came back  a little more hardcore  yeah yeah  well that apparently  is a relationship  in Hollywood  yeah  no that never  happened  I threw Doritos  but Bill  stars of the movie  yeah I was thinking  laughing  laughing  I think I'll start  putting post-its  on people's backs  laughing  yeah you put a  it said you put a sign  on her back 
[02:43:00]  yeah  yeah I know  yeah I know  but Bill  that's still a good story  though  I'm an alien baby  when all of that  alleged  but Bill  how cool is it  it said you were  hunky too  that's pretty  fucking good  well it said  there was not  one ounce of food  in that article  it says  it says she's getting  hot and heavy  hot and heavy  with me and Bill Burr  with hunky comedian  Bill Burr  who wrote that story  it was submitted  by anonymous  Bill B  laughing 
[02:43:30]  it says  it says Sandy  hasn't laughed so hard  or looked so good  in years  and it's all thanks  to Bill  thanks to Bill  that's great  they're constantly  joking and cutting up  together  Sandy says  they bonded so quickly  because they're both  of German-Irish descent  and they get each other's  quirky sense of humor  oh well you know  the quirky sense of humor  of the Germans  yeah  laughing  listen my  Kraut Mick friends  yes  yes  holy 
[02:44:00]  she was seen  giggling happily  as Bill became  red and enraged  talking about the  banking system  now they have  the Apple Store  and the Doritos  thing in here  they call you  the Three Stooges  because  you're all a riot  together  oh I believe you  I'm just  you're trying to  eat up 20 minutes  of radio  but that's why 
[02:44:30]  it's fun to read  this  it says here  you were sitting  in a tree  K-I-S-S-I  is that true  Bill Burr  you were giggling  as you dropped  Tumor's honey jars  fucking A Bill  oh and the  hilarious  the post-it said  kick me  I'm a stuck up  Hollywood bitch  whoa  Jesus  Bill  that's a little  too far  she found it 
[02:45:00]  hilarious  and wore it  all day long  and yeah  that never happened  Bill I didn't  I didn't  how bad I want  any of that  to be true  right  I didn't  I didn't think  for a moment  it was true  but it's great  to see your pal  you know  in the gossip pages  yeah  it really is cool  and it also proves  that all these  fucking rags  are pretty much  full of shit  yeah  when it comes to that  what's funny  is they  some people go  like you know  it's either  100% false  most of the time  or they  they got it right  or it's completely 
[02:45:30]  true  right  yeah  yeah  like they  they'll definitely  be like  yeah  this person's  relationship  is on the rocks  and blah blah blah  blah blah  but you know  nobody  I don't know  I have no  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  also  I almost started  doing what I usually do  I have like  one ounce of  fucking truth  and now I'm  going to sit here  and talk  like I know  the whole deal  you know the biz  you know the biz  the biz  show biz  baby  show biz  you were fucking  great in  Breaking Bad 
[02:46:00]  man  that was  it was so funny  I think the first  thing you said  when he got out  of the truck  was  Jesus guys  but it was  yeah that was  a  that was  you know  I don't know  I still can't  believe I get  to be on that  show  I've been  watching that  since the pilot  episode  it's fucking  great  it's a huge  show  your character  was great  man  I love  the look  on your face  when you're  trying to make  it look like  you're helping  him push  the truck  and you're  just kind of  you're looking 
[02:46:30]  at them  and they look  at you  and you're  like okay  you'll step  up a little  more  it just looks  fucking  it's hilarious  and that dumb  shirt you got  on  I know  Jesus  I should have  kept that thing  the way everybody  was bringing it up  people love the shirt  you should have kept it  it just looks stupid  yeah  you know what's funny  when they gave me  that shirt  and that whole get up  I was thinking  alright this guy's  a con man  I'm gonna try to  have some sort of  accent  and they're like  no no no  just keep talking  like you're from  Massachusetts  it'll be even  funnier  it really is  yeah  ah you guys 
[02:47:00]  know anything  about engines  your engine  yeah  that's like  some  new mexican  rancher  yeah  yeah  yeah you should  have had an  accent right  it was great  you're fucking  great in it man  really  it's fun  and it's just  fun to watch  you in it  well you know  what amazes me  about that show  is that how much  I loved Walter's  character  and was rooting  for him  to like  I think  I don't know  where it turned  yeah  but like  you know  I mean I know 
[02:47:30]  people TiVo stuff  now so I don't  want to ruin  anything  but like  I'll just say  in a broad  stroke here  is like  I can't stand  the guy now  like I'm rooting  against him  yeah it really  it's amazing  because they  had him change  change over  such a long  period of time  that it's a  realistic  like heel turn  that he did  you know  and now he's  just despicable  like  I'm looking  back on  like  how did  this get  so nuts  where was  the  well  when was  the turning  point  that 
[02:48:00]  yeah  this guy  disappeared  like  they just  subtly  I remember  the first  time  he went  ego  was when  the Hank  character  thought he  had caught  the Mr.  White character  remember when  he thought  he got  somebody  and he thought  that he caught  him  and Mr.  White was  drinking a little  bit and it  bothered him  it bothered him  that he was  insulted  that he thought  somebody else  could have been  as brilliant  as himself  yeah it's all  ego 
[02:48:30]  threw him back  on the trail  to get him  that's the first  time he chose  his ego  over remaining  anonymous  yeah that's  I think that is  where it started  turning  but it was done  so slowly  you can't really  pick this one  defining moment  but just a  fucking great  show  love it  you got any  more spots  in it  I'm not allowed  to tell  because you can't  say about the  whole character 
[02:49:00]  thing  oh ok  so that means  yes  could be a  yes  could be a  no  I'm hoping  to see you  I'm hoping  to see you  again  well Bill  Netflix  yeah Netflix  let's get the  Bill Burr comedy  special  yes and I know  you guys are  worldwide  so it's also  on Netflix  Canada  in Ireland  and all of  Great Britain  Netflix is  the shit  they're like  international HBO

[02:51:30]  this year it's hockey  time is what I'm  getting at Bill  I forgot it's time  for hockey I don't  know if there's a  lockout oh but they  are heading in that  direction hey do I  got time for one more  wacky story yes what  did Sandra do oh man  sorry Jesus I'm in  I'm in the airport and  I always opt out of  going through that  giant microwave you  know you gotta stand  spread eagle we heard  about that from De 
[02:52:00]  Rosa yeah yeah  everything but your  taint right you just  stand there and get  zapped yeah so I  don't you know and I  know people give me  shit yeah you're  talking your cell phone  when you're flying on  the plane there's  radiation and my whole  thing is I get that  there's radiation in  my life but if I can  opt out of the extra  yeah supersized  radiation I'm gonna do  it so everybody thinks  I'm an idiot saying  it's not that bad you're  a moron it takes an  extra 15 minutes to get  through security so I'm  in Logan Airport and I'm  standing there the  usual trying to keep an 
[02:52:30]  eye on my wallet as I  wait for the people to  passively aggressively  finally come and pat me  down right yeah I see  that the security lady  sees this kid comes  walking up and she  goes how old are you  and he goes 13 and she  goes come this way and  she had him just walk  through the metal  detector so I'm standing  there going so I'm  supposed to go into  something that could  kill a 13 year old and  just stand there spread  eagle oh good point  well they don't want his  nuts getting irradiated at  that age I guess huh  what evidently it's okay 
[02:53:00]  to irradiate my nuts yeah  yeah there's enough  radiation to prevent me  from going through puberty  had I been going through  that right right and I  guess they wow what is  that I guess they figure  he's young so he's got a  lot more of life of  absorbing radiation and  you know old bill burr  who's halfway through his  life and  Jesus Christ that is  fucked up but is it for  that reason though I  don't know I feel  vindicated I think you're  right hold on could it  just be that they make 
[02:53:30]  random pics who they  think are less security  risks and just put them  through the less secure  metal detector no they  put them through the old  school one the regular  old metal detector well  that's what I mean yeah  they put them through that  instead of the if they  like there's certain  people they might deem  less of a security risk so  they just will  occasionally pull  people out and put them  through the metal  detector as opposed to  the x-ray I haven't  seen that done  there was no delay I'm  telling you okay  listen I used to work in  a dental office when we  we used to take an x-ray  of one tooth we put the 
[02:54:00]  camera the camera the  radiation was just right  where your cheek it is  right up against your face  we put a lead vest over  all your all your vitals  right over your crotch and  then I left the room stood  behind a wall that had  lead in it and I pressed  the button just take a  picture of your incisor  yeah and this is your  whole fucking thing I  actually think that by  opting out where they  have me standing is so  close to the thing I'm 
[02:54:30]  getting more radiation  than if I went through  it and they go sir  stand right there it's  like I'm not standing  next to that fucking  thing and you're going  to be dead in like six  years yeah because you're  close enough to it and it  takes longer so you're  there for like three  people going through it  yeah so I always walk  over to the other side  and they say sir don't  stand there I go I'm  keeping an eye on my  wallet and then they go  okay just stand right  there oh wow good  fucking point man wow 
[02:55:00]  man in and there spread  eagle even your armpits  are getting hit I'm telling  you let me let me get it  all let me get all those  lymph nodes you got them  oh shit they don't have  that fucking figured out  they don't know for sure  right now they don't  hell no the same way  they could be at the  first iPhone comes out  sucks and then they  figure it out three months  later that's a new  radiation machine I'm not  going in that thing  fuck yourself I I got it  I'm with Bill on this  one yeah and and we got  an answer Bill Scotty  Waz writes the NHL is up 
[02:55:30]  September 15th and all  the media jobbers say it's  doom and gloom and could be  a lockout I did not know  that and pretty plus more  one of the regulars on  Twitter Bill Burke talking  about how women with  plastic surgery have  discovered a new age was  hysterical fucking great  she's already seen the  Netflix special there  oh nice nice yeah that  your plastic surgery set is  hilarious I saw that at  Carnegie Hall oh my god  funny really good built 
[02:56:00]  all right well there you  go I've whored myself up  good job I told my my  investigative reporter  story about the airport  he just wanted to be  vindicated right and I  squashed rumors you  squashed the rumor  rumors because I don't  think Bill Burr has  talked about that oh boy  Bill thanks we'll see you  when you're in New York  all right guys we'll see  you take it easy  yeah buddy and of course  Bill Burr on Twitter  thanks Bill there he goes  Bill's good I want to  like the Bill Burr you  want to see the first part  of the Boston thing  that breaking bad god 
[02:56:30]  damn it yeah I got it  I'm still waiting for the  first see that shit I  could see it on my  fucking great yeah is it  on my TV it's on on  demand you can see that I  don't have Netflix and why  are you yelling at me and  then I caught up and then I  caught up on anyone else  could yell that by you rock  during the show I don't know  I don't why you yell that  at me he wasn't trying to  yell oh well this is all I  heard as I'm trying to talk  to my pal aunt it's on  Netflix oh god that's what  you get in your ear sometimes  you rock why are you 
[02:57:00]  yelling why are you  yelling we didn't even make  funnier today I finished up  watching the rest of the  couple of Louie's that I  missed too and you know I  also noticed it was  noticed shit about Louie  he's he's really good at  acting like natural but I  don't know anyone who can  put those facial expressions  on like he does it's like  it's almost a Gleason thing  like Gleason was really good  at making those faces and 
[02:57:30]  he didn't you don't even  have to say anything like  he would just make faces  and it's not the same type  of face but it's it's as  effective when Louie's doing  it because someone can be  someone could be talking and  Louie's just rolling his eyes  or like it's so uncomfortable  to watch him sometimes when  he's doing that I just thought  it was he's a very talented  gentleman he puts the whole  damn thing together I know  it's crazy I want to see  Bill Burr doing the US gives  us a tour of Boston just I 
[02:58:00]  know it's a long video I just  want to see Jesus the first  minute or so that's him on  drums I bet hey what's up  it's Bill Burr and it's time  for another one of my  wonderful informative on the  mark tours and this time we're  in Boston my fucking hometown my  fucking hometown do we're at the  we're at the comedy connection  the Wilbur theater the Wilbur as 
[02:58:30]  they say here and there will be a  lot of obnoxious Boston accent on  this one testing the lights over  there there it is going to be  performing here a lot of history  in this place look at that door  look at that side door up there  you know what that is that's from  the old comedy connection I  believe that set that was the set  that they built when Rosie O'Donnell  made a she made a special see that  it's just give that that's that's  just a little appetizer of the kinds  of information this is it this is  this is backstage isn't it glamorous 
[02:59:00]  oh my god you made it this is this  is the backstage area you know this  is how it is they spend all the money  out there and back here they go get  on stage you fucking animal this is  one of my favorite this is one of my  favorite most random things I've ever  seen backstage this is a dental chair  you know I don't know why it's here I  don't know why it's that color I'm  actually going to try to guess the  year judging by that color pre 80s  pre 70s I'm gonna guess that's 1960s  right when Sinatra started to fill out 
[02:59:30]  whatever year that was you know when  his head just got a little bigger  alright this is the this is the green  room this is very famous because it  has a loud air conditioner and also  allegedly Marlon Brando when he was a  struggling actor was doing some sort of  play here and he actually slept here  you know isn't that I don't give a  fuck either I just realized I didn't  care either here's my show shirt  hanging up you like this  it's very good I have a little 
[03:00:00]  information by the way on x-ray scanners  oh yeah the difference between the the  one bill was talking about was a medium  x-ray which is what they do is in the  dentist office but the ones in the  airports are low energy or whatever they  are they're called backs scan things  they're much you let him tell you that  yeah Jim you let him tell you that  they're much lower only 5% of them  actually penetrates you I think they 
[03:00:30]  said how much radiation are you exposed  to from a back scatter scanner which is  the airport they said one general use of  back scatter is 0.01 mrem whatever the  fuck that is is that good well they say  one day of just natural background  radiation is equal to 10 of those  scans so basically it's a 10th of the  radiation that you would receive on a  normal day just walking around it's  the average commercial airplane flight  is equal just one way is equal to 40 of 
[03:01:00]  those scans just being in the plane  just being on flight is equal to 40 of  the scans that you go through so it's  kind of silly not to go through them  because you're getting on a plane that's  going to give you 40 times that yeah  better than 41 and they say will it  that's what Bill would say yeah that's  what Bill would say they say how many  back scatter scans would it take to  cause harmful effects yes difficult to  estimate they said because radiation  doesn't penetrate the sensitive organs  for this example though let's say 5% of 
[03:01:30]  the x-ray actually penetrated to  sensitive organs just for this example to  accumulate a dose that will cause a  clinically observable effect not harmful  but observable we would need to have  over 1 million scans in a relatively  short period of time is this from the  company that makes the scanner this is  um Frank's radiation scare  how's radiation no it's just radiation 
[03:02:00]  radiation answers dot org um and again  those numbers may be off but I've read  similar stuff before because I did check  into it because you fly a lot yeah and  I've asked you should be concerned  about and they said that it's so low I  think it's uh it's so much it's like  1 100th of an x-ray for the dentist I  think it's that's the uh I believe it's  1 100th hell I don't want any part of  that though that doesn't bother I don't  give a shit uh I don't get me I don't 
[03:02:30]  care I don't care these fucking  headphones every day yeah I just make  believe it's okay oh man hey uh bill  bird just wrote back I don't know why  he didn't say this on the air download  ice rage for your iPhone great game do  you know ice for it I'm always looking  for a new phone never heard of it sir but  it's probably hockey oh that's why ice  rate yeah oh good point what is what do  you do with this game I don't know never  heard of people and stuff I said oh it's  an iPhone game huh oh well I let it I'm 
[03:03:00]  shit out of luck yeah oh boy maybe it's  uh that's iPhone gameplay review but  maybe it's uh let's see the review it's  also on how about we go with the review  no I don't need my platform fuck my  platform get the review of the game now  I'm I'm just curious about this yeah oh  boy  right an often ignored aspect of portable  gaming is the opportunity to involve  other people directly in the game you're 
[03:03:30]  playing this doesn't always go smoothly  and multiplayer modes involving passing  the device can feel incredibly clunky  clunky as such the iOS multi-touch  feature created an opportunity for more  than one person to play a game at the  same time and mountain sheep's latest  release ice rage tries to cash in on the  style of play at its core ice rage is a  simple retro inspired breakdown of ice  hockey a virtual stick guide your player  around the screen while a single button  pulls the usual double time of tackling  when not in possession of the puck and 
[03:04:00]  shooting when you are depending on the  difficulty level the opposing AI will  either move faster or slower while the  final hard mode puts you in control of  your own goalie as well extra difficulty  comes from needing to move your mobile  player up or down to do the same with the  goalie making it that's awful it looks  awful yes why thumbs playing hockey on  your phone fuck you doing terrible really  is I hate handheld games though you're not 
[03:04:30]  a handheld game guy I'm not a handheld gamer  that's for sure  thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb  Finger thumb, finger thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb, finger thumb, finger thumb.  Ugh.  It's exhausting.  You just take the fun out of everything.  No, I just don't find it.  With your logic.  I love fun things.  It just comes down to thumb, thumb, thumb, thumb.  That's all it is.  You thumb it all over the place.  Cut it out.  Quit thumbing everything up.  Thumbing.  I'll be on Fallon tonight. 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  Tyra Banks, unless they cancel me.  Tonight's your Fallon appearance.  It is, yeah.  And then I go to L.A. tomorrow.  Jimmy's becoming very famous.  I'm really not.  This Jim Norton is becoming very famous.  You know, it's funny.  I was just talking to Jonathan about my utter irrelevance as a comedian.  No, it's amazing.  And I'm not feeling sorry for myself, but I do a tremendous amount of it.  But you're on Fallon.  That's not.  No, and I do Leno a lot.  And I'm doing Jeff's show.  I do a lot of TV, man.  A lot of Red Eye.  It's like I get a lot of TV spots, but it translates into who gives a fuck.  It really is who gives a shit.  None of it means anything. 
[03:05:30]  See, now he's taking the fun out of his TV appearance.  But I'm not.  I'm being realistic about it.  I think it's exciting that you're on Jimmy Fallon.  I love Jimmy.  And I'm actually really looking forward to doing his show.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I went to the pre-interview yesterday.  And they were so cool and easy.  And Jimmy's a nice dude.  And he's a funny guy.  Oh, yeah.  I think, I'm not going to say it's going to be easy to get laughs.  But I think it'll be a comfortable environment.  Are you doing a set or just a power?  A power.  A power, yeah.  Because I'm comfortable with him.  So I think it'll be nice.  Does he have comics through sets?  I don't even know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  That's where Jaslyn came from, actually.  He was a writer on Jimmy's show. 
[03:06:00]  Very cool.  Jim Norton on Fallon tonight.  And then he's got the big gig up there in Hampton Beach at the Hampton Beach Casino, right?  Yeah.  But it's just fucking depressing.  It really is.  It's a fucking endlessly depressing business.  Yeah?  Yes.  You just feel like you've got no traction?  No.  None.  None.  None.  Yeah, but then, you know, all of a sudden you do.  You hope.  I mean, uh...  And people love going to see you.  Nah, I'm not saying that they don't. 
[03:06:30]  But, I mean, you know what I mean?  Like, the people that like me like me, I appreciate them.  But it really is an endless fucking...  And these guys are in much worse shape than I am.  I'm aware of that.  But, I mean, people are like, well, the economy.  No.  The economy is not the problem.  There's plenty of fucking people out there buying tickets for comedy shows.  It's not the economy.  Comedians want to convince themselves it's the economy.  Because that feels easier to swallow.  It's easier to pallet.  There's a lot of choices, though.  There are a lot of choices.  There was a time when you would go on a TV show, the whole fucking country was watching. 
[03:07:00]  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you can't expect to sell a thousand-seat theater because you do a...  Because Jay Leno's still doing well, and what was the story?  He cut his staff and...  They cut 20 people off the staff, and Jay took a huge page cut just to avoid more staff cuts.  Right.  And I think that...  I haven't talked to anybody from there, but I think it's NBC just doing it across the  board because the network is struggling.  But it's not like he's hurting.  He's still doing his job.  It's just a different world.  Yeah.  I mean, everybody feels it, but it's like... 
[03:07:30]  And I don't mean who gives a shit about Fallon.  I'm saying it's a general picture.  None of it...  Like, I just did a special.  It was a decent special, but none of it means anything.  It really doesn't.  It's all irrelevant.  Who gives a fuck?  It really does translate into who cares.  I'm really sad now.  Don't be.  It's the truth.  I don't know.  I think it's out there and stuff, you know?  Yeah.  You did it.  It's out there.  People saw it.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck.  Give a fuck.  They did see it.  Isn't that what this is every day, though?  I know we get a fuck.  It's like we blab into this, and then it's done, and who cares? 
[03:08:00]  I don't think people give a fuck as much as they used to about this.  I don't think they do at all, to be honest.  But I don't think it's our fault.  Hey, someone just sent me Phyllis Diller roasting Joan Rivers.  What year is that from?  1948.  I have to leave.  I have a doctor appointment.  What?  A second one in two days, because, again, they told me what I already knew, that I had central  sleep apnea.  So then this fucking guy, who I think is a terrible doctor, goes, yeah, you got to see  my partner.  He does more of the central stuff as opposed to obstructive. 
[03:08:30]  Good.  So I'm going to have to go through another test, because, what, the data doesn't translate?  Well, you fucking, I hate the medical profession.  I really do.  Hate it.  Yeah, they are fucking assholes.  Hate it.  I'll give you that much.  I'm going to get paid to say GameZeebo.com on the air.  All right.  Okay.  I don't know.  Some pocket money for me.  Someone that's not a fan of AppSpy says, say GameZeebo.com on the air, and I assume  that means I get a fucking check now. 
[03:09:00]  No, you probably don't.  No?  Damn it.  Anything else, Jimmy?  Jimmy, Fallon Tonight, Hampton Beach Casino, and a bunch of other who gives a shit things.  Honestly.  And then the improv in Irvine, September 13, 14, 15, and some other gigs that no one can  show up to.  Fucking cares.  You just wait for this whole thing to explode, and it just doesn't.  It just doesn't.  It just doesn't.  But it's not even this.  It's just, it's like there's other vehicles, too, and none of them fucking mean anything.  I think it just, I think it's because the time is just different. 
[03:09:30]  No.  People don't care.  The fucking, even the Chip videos, like, they're funny, and they're, you know, for people who  like Chip, they only get, what, 20,000 views, but which is nothing.  Over the, one has 70,000 over the.  That's great.  But it's not.  It means some fucking 13-year-old girl who's like, you know, a deedle, deedle, deedle,  two balloons on her head gets four million.  Well, yeah.  But that's, it's utter and absolute irrelevance.  Now you understand why I hate the Kardashians so much. 
[03:10:00]  But I don't hate them.  I fucking hate them.  It's me that I have the problem with.  Because of the reason you just said, people would rather watch the Kardashians as some  dopey girl with balloons on her head than real entertainment, like real fucking creative  shit.  But people also go to see Kevin Hart and Louis.  So, like, they are, there are, it's, I would agree with you if it was just the Kardashians  and, like, even fucking great comedians like Louis, but Louis sold 14 shows at the fucking  Civic Center.  But that's just harder to do because more people are focusing on the girl with the balloons 
[03:10:30]  on her head.  Nah, but that's not, that's not her fault.  I, I, I credit her for doing her own thing.  But I don't understand how that happens.  How does a video like that get four million views?  That's relevant.  For what reason?  Don't know.  Don't know.  I wish I knew.  I don't know either.  I wish I knew.  Is she funny?  Have you seen that video, Ed?  Uh, no.  It's not my thing.  Is it quirky?  Is it because she's hot?  What is it?  Oh, I just made that up.  I mean, I'm talking about, like, uh, you know, but I, I, I feel like, yeah, I feel  like I, I know exactly what you're talking about, though.  It resonates.  Those type of videos on YouTube.  They're not the people that I would probably have come see me. 
[03:11:00]  You know what I mean?  But they are, they're an audience, but not for Jim Norton.  But, uh, so I'm not saying I want those particular people.  True.  You just.  But it's like, you know, I just know what relevance feels like, and this is not it.  Yeah, we should just give up.  No, it's just, but I don't give up.  I, I like, I work seven nights a week, and I'm always doing new material, and it just,  it comes, it means nothing.  It really does mean absolutely fucking shit.  I'm telling you.  I see it because I'm in it.  From the outside, it might look different, but I'm telling you, it's of no value. 
[03:11:30]  But you know what's weird?  Then one day you'll do something like a throwaway thing, and that's the thing.  Right.  Right.  I'm serious.  That's what happens with people.  Yeah.  And you're like, what, now?  That dumb thing is what makes you pay attention to what we're doing, or what you're doing,  Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Such a weird world, the entertainment business.  Yeah, it is.  It's really strange.  It is.  And believe me, I know this guy's in a lot worse shape, so I'm not, you know what I mean,  I'm aware of where I am in the pecking order.  In the good way, and in the terrible way. 
[03:12:00]  In the terrible way.  I'm just not.  But I mean, I'm aware of my own.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just not aware.  Your own position in life.  Yeah, I mean, I know.  I'm just not aware of anything.  We're all pretty aware of our own place.  Yeah.  I just know that it's futile.  Oh.  Oh, man.  I got recognized two days ago.  That felt good.  First time in about a month.  It does feel good, actually.  First time in about a month, and I'm not even joking.  I'm like, oh, wow, cool.  Thanks, man.  It does feel good.  Got recognized in Chicago, but then again, they came to see us. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You probably get recognized, and you just don't see anything.  Oh.  I don't know.  No.  No, to be completely honest, when we were at N.E.W., holy fuck, we couldn't walk the  streets at one point.  I saw M. Night Shyamalan yesterday.  I didn't say anything to him.  Well, you should have said hi.  He said, why do you make so many shitty movies?  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  What's wrong with you?  That's why I didn't say anything.  Where did you see him?  I was walking in my parking lot, and he was walking down the street with some chick.  How about this?  Does every movie have to have a huge surprise?  Exactly. 
[03:13:00]  Ding dong.  Oh, I get it.  The spaceman has two hats.  I see what you're doing there.  M. Night with a period, Shyamalan, whatever your name is.  Wait a minute.  I think they're afraid of the rain.  I got to go, boys.  I'll see you tomorrow.  All right, Jimmy.  If you go, we go, Jimmy.  That's how this works.  All right.  Have fun.  I'm going to listen to see if Sam Roberts gets out of his slump today.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Club Soda Kenny is telling everybody that you're in a two-day slump.  I guess Club Soda Kenny is in a ten-year slump.  He gets bored, and he has to say things to people. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, you know that we got fired ten years ago yesterday, according to Alan Sniffen on  the New York Radio Message Board?  What?  That thing's still going?  Someone got a hold of me and said that he had a big thing that we got fired ten years ago.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's still going?  I know we did.  He still does that?  Ten years ago this week, O&A fired.  Oh, this week that he's calling it.  Someone said it ten years ago yesterday.  I don't even know our firing date from that big Sex for Sam thing. 
[03:14:00]  I know we did it on the 15th.  I'm still more amazed that Alan Sniffen's Radio Message Board is still going.  Still fucking going.  And it's the same format.  And it's the exact same people.  Jesus.  Time has stood still on that site.  I go there every once in a while.  Every once in a while I do go there.  I haven't been there probably in ten years.  Did he do, uh, uh, what were the audio ones?  Oh, the, uh, Alan Sniffen's Board Reflections.  Oh, yeah, Board Reflections.  It's Alan Sniffen. 
[03:14:30]  He does say that he thinks you should not have been fired and that you guys getting fired  killed the momentum of the show and the entire concept of hot talk targeting men.  Yes.  Yeah, I think he did some porous even back in the day.  He wasn't a fan necessarily of what we did, but he understood that we shouldn't have been fired.  I believe that was his take on it.  And I respect him for that.  But he's an old school radio guy.  It's tough to really get behind a lot of stuff.  Old school radio guy, dentist.  Guy.  Right.  Dentist.  Well, if you did a Board Reflection on that, please let us know.
