<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts expressing their frustration over Sirius XM's vacation policies.  They felt unfairly disadvantaged compared to their staff, specifically Dr. Gay and Danny, who had cleverly maximized their vacation time using leftover days and "legacy XM days," leaving Opie and Anthony with significantly fewer days off.  This segment was interspersed with running jokes about the show's poor, yellowish studio lighting and a mysterious coffee cup trick performed by one of the hosts. A caller requested Anthony Cumia's email address, prompting further complaints about their boss and the superior compensation received by their staff, particularly highlighted by a poorly-received mass-emailed Christmas card.  The conversation then transitioned to the Republican presidential primary debates, focusing on Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry, before moving to a discussion of internet trends like "Tebowing," "planking," and "horsemanning," including a story about high school students suspended for "Tebowing."  A teacher, Chris, called in to discuss the incident, leading to a broader conversation about education, school discipline, and the challenges of teaching, punctuated by anecdotes from the hosts' own school days.

The show then shifted gears, with Opie, Anthony, and Sam Roberts discussing parenthood, specifically Anthony's 19-month-old son being taught dirty Spanish by his housekeeper. This led to a discussion about their own Spanish-learning experiences and humorous anecdotes about their housekeepers.  Caller Jim briefly chimed in on child education, followed by more personal anecdotes from the hosts, including frustrations with paperwork involved in buying a house.  Another caller, Quinton, mentioned a sports penalty. The conversation veered towards music, prompted by MTV's airing of Nirvana's *Unplugged*, leading to a discussion of how perceptions of time change with age.  This segued into an analysis of 2011's top Google searches, including Rebecca Black's "Friday," the Japanese earthquake, Adele, and Casey Anthony.  The hosts played audio clips of "Friday" and "Person of Interest," offering both mockery and fascination.  Other top searches like Steve Jobs, iPad 2, and Battlefield 3 were also mentioned.

The show continued with an analysis of Japanese writing, a discussion of a kayaker surviving a 95-foot waterfall, and a tangent about Christian Bale's experiences in China.  Adele's appearance and Pavarotti's lifestyle were discussed, before returning to Google's top searches and a discussion of Ryan Dunn.  A lengthy debate ensued about Google Plus, followed by further discussion of Rebecca Black's career.  Comedian Natasha Leggero joined the show in studio.  The conversation briefly touched upon Rick Perry's controversial views on gay rights and Christmas before playing and analyzing a Chinese-language version of Rebecca Black's "Friday."  Further conversation with Natasha continued until the end of this segment.

The next segment heavily featured Natasha Leggero.  They discussed their disdain for Times Square and tourist traps, contrasting it with their preference for downtown NYC.  Leggero discussed the unique challenges faced by female comedians, referencing Christopher Hitchens' controversial opinions on the topic.  The conversation moved to divorce, its financial aspects, and how settlements often favored women, using Alec Baldwin's divorce as an example.  They delved into the differences in humor between men and women. Leggero shared stories from her career, including her role on *Joe Schmo*, her time judging on *Last Comic Standing*, and a film role with Adam Arkin (mistakenly referred to as Alan Arkin), showcasing a childhood acting clip.  She also discussed working on Chelsea Handler's show and the challenges of multi-cam sitcoms, including playing a clip of *The Big Bang Theory* without a laugh track.  The conversation included off-color jokes, opinions on Michelle Bachmann and Sarah Palin, Black Friday shopping, and driving and cab drivers in New York City.

The final segment with Natasha Leggero began with a discussion about Florida, her dislike for the state, and Anna Nicole Smith's death. This led to a critical assessment of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton, and Snooki, including criticisms of Snooki's book.  They discussed the low bar for success in reality TV, playing clips from *Bad Girls Club* and discussing other reality shows like *Storage Wars*, *Pawn Stars*, *Hardcore Pawn*, and *American Pickers*.  Leggero promoted her upcoming trip with Chelsea Handler and her stand-up shows, while Jimmy Norton (also present) promoted his own appearances. The show concluded with further discussion on the absurdity of reality TV.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning. Screw you, Captain Jerk.  Ah!  Why am I introing these guys?  Then don't!  Oh.  There's a man out there. The man.  On the wing.  The man.  Ah.  We're the only live show at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Is that what's happening?  Because we have a shitty agent.  Oh.  Wow, wow.  Wow.  Well, we do. 
[00:00:30]  We've done a lot of live shows today.  Not a lot of live shows?  I don't think so.  No, even our staff has better agents, because they're done for the year.  Our staff has better agents.  Many do.  Dr. Gay's done for the year, and Danny's done for the year, right?  Dr. Gay and Danny are done.  They're done for the year.  For the year.  And I'm not bitching. They have a better agent.  It's a nice time off right there. Nice.  How do we get an agent like that?  I don't know. I mean...  How does the staff get off and where they're coming? 
[00:01:00]  I don't get this.  It's amazing.  It's pure lunacy.  It's fucking...  It's a bizarro world.  They're really done for the year, and I'm thinking, wait a minute.  We're all in this together, so how did that happen?  How did they get more vacation than us?  They saved up some vacation days and some legacy XM days left over, and you know, end of the year comes.  Don't we have legacy XM days?  We should have legacy.  You know how long I've been doing this?  I should have a lot of days coming.  Shouldn't they be used at the same time? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  You would think that, but...  The days are going to expire by the end of December, and they have, you know, 10 days, so they go, okay, boom.  And look, because this will get back to Travis and Danny.  I'm not bitching about them.  Trust me.  Fuck, I love when you can figure out a way around the system.  I'm all about that.  But it doesn't make sense.  How did we not have days?  This is what happened.  I don't know.  When we...  Thanks, Sal.  What, Sam?  Just the acknowledgement was funny. 
[00:02:00]  Why?  I like the Sal.  I like Sal, too.  When we first got to see...  The old regime rules were...  Hoo-hoo!  Magic coffee cup works again!  Again, with the coffee cup level.  Man, you can't deny it.  I know the trick.  I'm not falling for that.  I still don't know the trick.  Don't fall for that old gag.  I know, you just got some coffee.  Small cup into large cup, and look, right to the tippy top every time.  Like Toledo.  It's amazing.  I still don't know how you do that.  I honestly don't.  See?  So when we were back at 57th Street... 
[00:02:30]  57th, not 57th.  57th.  Okay.  When nobody was paying attention, it was just like, okay, the staff would be on vacation when  the show was on vacation, and when the show wasn't, the staff wasn't.  You're boring me.  Yeah.  But then why would you ask the question?  Like you're going long for him.  He's meandering.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You're meandering, Sam.  You think you're trying to get to 11 o'clock or 10 fucking 53 o'clock.  We have enough.  I'm trying to help.  You.  We have enough.  Well, you should have taken a few days, too. 
[00:03:00]  You went all the way back to, I don't know, five years ago or something.  Yeah.  What happened?  Eric Logan's still in college.  That's the story.  You're meandering on me.  All right.  Well, the days are going to expire, so I had to use him.  Cool.  That's beautiful.  That was even too long.  That's beautiful.  So are our days expiring?  I don't know.  I didn't work out your deal.  How are they done for the year?  I was about to tell you, but you said it was boring.  Oh.  Do you want them to get wordy or not?  Yes.  Yes, because I'm curious. 
[00:03:30]  Today's Friday.  What do you think of your mind?  There's three days next week, right?  What days are we working next week?  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Oh, God.  That's going to be an eternity.  But the problem is, what I don't understand is, like, we work way more days than anyone  else around here.  And then, like, when our year ends, which is October 1st, they yell and scream at us that  we don't have any days left.  I'm like, this doesn't make sense.  They told me in September I had five more vacation days before October 1st, and I was  like, this fucking rocks. 
[00:04:00]  I'll spread them out a little bit.  And then the next day, because I guess they had a dumb meeting, they go, oh, actually,  that's not true.  How can you tell me it's true and not true within a day?  Yeah.  And now we're hearing our staff has more days off than we do.  Yeah.  More power to them, I guess.  They separated the vacation times.  What do you mean?  So they said when we got here to Sirius...  That still doesn't make sense, because we're all in this together.  We were also part of XM.  So how did you guys get more vacation days out of XM than we did? 
[00:04:30]  I don't think we have more days, but they said that our vacation days and your vacation  days cannot be counted together.  So, like, Danny or Travis came in here, and I came in here on days...  Are you meandering again?  I think you are.  Oh, wait.  On days we were off...  We were in.  You should be.  So then we have those days.  No.  Look, I don't...  I'm here.  I'm not...  But why would you have to be here if we're not here?  Because we don't have days, as many days as you.  No, that's not true.  But obviously you do. 
[00:05:00]  Like, these four days here.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they take the...  Why would they take these when we're...  Yeah.  We're not here.  So you guys work when we don't, and then...  Just to take off at the end of the year?  And then you get more vacation days because of that?  That's fucked up.  And like I said, I'm not fucking blowing up anyone's spot because, you know, God bless  you guys for figuring it out.  Yeah.  Seriously.  I'm just confused.  I mean, you're left with...  You know, you don't check your days, and then at the end of the year, you either eat your 
[00:05:30]  vacation days or you take off days while the show's on.  Or there should be days that you don't come in when we don't come in, like instead of  coming in.  I think I know what it is.  What is it?  Go ahead.  Come on in.  I know.  Come on.  Let's do this.  I don't know.  Let's do this today.  The vacationing in New Hope together?  I don't know if it's fucking anybody's...  Let's shoot our way out of this fucking building.  Let's go.  Let's do it.  Here's why I think they've worked it out this way.  Okay.  They come in when we don't do a show.  Right.  Right.  But they're forced to. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I know.  Which is weird because there's no...  I mean...  I know.  Now, you would think it would be advantageous if they do have days to just take them when  we take off.  That would be a perfect scenario.  And then that way we're all in together.  But here's the deal.  Okay.  What would you...  You couldn't even consider an easier day here...  Oh, my God.  Oh, I know.  ...than when we're not here.  Of course.  It's the best days ever.  So why wouldn't you come in on the days we're not here, be able to, you know, just hang  out...  Right.  ...and then take the days when we are on the air, and then, you know, you get off when 
[00:06:30]  you would be working and stuff.  God, it...  It's fucking brilliant.  For the most part...  Don't you hate being so much smarter than everyone else?  I know.  It's a chore.  They're just idiots.  I love your term.  They just look like dummies in a hot tub.  It's like they force you to come in here when we're not here.  That's so stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to call those free money days.  Free money days.  Why wouldn't you?  Because what do they do?  They check in on you once, maybe, and you're like, oh, I'm working on an important file. 
[00:07:00]  No, they walk past the office a couple of times just to make sure you're there.  And don't let them come up and go, well, we heard the show, and now from now on, you  have to take off when...  No, nothing changes.  Nothing changes.  Just stop.  I'm just amazed that our...  We need a producer here.  Who cares?  I'm just amazed that our staff is done and we still have to do shows.  You reckon me are standing strong?  What the fuck?  And I hear Roland's done after today.  No.  No, he's here Monday for Stephen Merchant and some other stuff, but I think he's done 
[00:07:30]  after that.  No.  He may get sick, but he's not done after that.  Ah, okay.  Roland will be here all next week unless he gets sick on Tuesday.  Oh, he's done a sick thing?  All right.  God bless him.  I saw on Twitter everybody saying, hey, everybody from the Stern Show going, hey, see you next  year.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, wow.  What do you mean the half of them aren't here and half are off?  They're all gone?  Oh, I think they're all gone.  Yeah.  Of course they are.  They already work 33% less than us. 
[00:08:00]  Make a gazillion more dollars than us.  Well...  We just stink, man.  We're here.  We're here, though.  Why, though?  I don't know.  To entertain the fines.  Listeners.  I mean, I like doing this.  I really do, but I don't like when I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.  It gets to a point.  Yeah, it's like...  And if that asshole fucking sends me that mass fucking Christmas greeting this year...  You don't like that?  I'm fucking tweeting that shit.  You don't take that to heart?  What a fucking asshole. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, this is nice.  I print him out and put him up with my cards that I get mailed to my house.  And make believe he sent it just to you?  Yes.  We have a boss that mass emails his Christmas card.  Lucky you're getting that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know what?  You know how pompous of an asshole you have to be to send that out to your staff?  A staff that hasn't had a raise in years?  Raise?  I don't even know what that word is.  Holy fuck.  Stopped even asking.  Did he send that out yet?  You stop asking. 
[00:09:00]  You stop expecting anything.  You just...  They beat you down to the point where it's like, raise?  Oh, yeah.  Didn't companies used to give out raises?  Wow.  And now you don't even think of it.  It's like a dinosaur.  It's extinct.  It's the dodo bird.  We have the financial dodo bird here.  God, don't insult me.  Take me off your stupid mass email Christmas card list.  I don't want to see that crap this year.  Makes me feel good.  Did he send it out yet?  I feel loved.  Because I don't check corporate email anymore.  I don't check corporate email.  I've never gotten one.  A corporate email.  No. 
[00:09:30]  You sent it to you.  I'm not on that corporate email list.  No.  You guys get it, too.  You just don't...  Yeah.  I probably have 10,000 emails out there, too.  It's so insulting.  Yeah, like the email that's whatever mine is for this place.  I don't fucking...  I don't think I've ever checked that email.  You're in the system.  Oh, well.  How about that?  I don't know.  Probably 8 million fucking emails that just will never be looked at.  Yep.  But have never been looked at.  Yes, Iraq?  Early in some point in 2009 when we were here, IT called the office to Steve and asked, 
[00:10:00]  Hey, could you ask Anthony maybe to check into his account?  We're not seeing that it's being refreshed or whatever.  And Steve goes, Yeah, you just might as well delete that.  It's not happening.  Just delete that account.  I don't need that.  What do I need the corporate account for?  So at any moment they could peer into what I'm saying to anybody?  Fuck that noise.  Yeah.  I got my phone.  I got my personal email account.  And if that ain't good enough, go fuck yourself.  Big brother, man!  Man!  They're going to look at my emails, man! 
[00:10:30]  Oh, wow.  See, I've ordered video games on pre-order.  That's pretty much what that is.  Kevin from Connecticut wants to know if your email is anthonycumia at highvoltage.com.  Highvoltage!  Yeah, that's the one.  Hey, man, that wasn't our name.  That was terrible.  It was a terrible name by stupid Rebecca.  The virus wasn't ours either.  The virus wasn't ours either.  No one calls her Rebecca.  Well, look.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  The virus was elegant.  The virus was elegant.  What?  The big surprise.  I got the new name in the chat.  So that's the surprise?  Yeah.  It's a terrible surprise.  Big surprise.  We've never had a good surprise.  Fuck that.  Around this joint.  So I guess everyone's off except us.  So that's what we're getting at.  So let us entertain you.  Let us make you smile.  You want to turn on the yellow lights today?  Should I flip them on?  No.  The jaundice lights.  Why do they give up on the lights, Sam? 
[00:11:30]  Do you know?  Why do they give up on the lights?  Yeah, seriously.  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, because they were asking me questions about lights and they knew there weren't going  to be any answers because I have no expertise in lighting.  But how hard could this be?  You just need a light guy in here.  Every fucking photo is yellow.  There just needs to be a lighting guy in here.  That's the only...  Oh, well, Mars is setting up the yellow filter.  A little yellow colored gel.  Well, I guess it's a gel, technically.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, boy.  Ready?  Hit it.  Mars is working there. 
[00:12:00]  Look at him.  He's trying.  The gel's falling off.  He's trying.  This is just mind-boggling.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  The sun is behind me again.  Why won't they fucking work on the basics for us?  He says the sun came out last night.  It sang to him.  Close encounters.  Yeah.  There you go.  Holy shit.  That's nice, right?  Oh, that's nice.  Wow, that's good. 
[00:12:30]  That's acceptable.  That's good.  It's comfortable lighting.  Real comfortable.  I need a little tan on my retina.  Yeah.  All right, well.  This is great after a night of Call of Duty.  Ow.  Oh, really?  Oh, God, my eyes are killing me.  What do they say about Call of Duty?  It made a billion dollars in 16 days?  It sold a billion copies.  Oh, is it a billion copies or a billion dollars?  I think it's a billion dollars.  A billion dollars?  Fastest entertainment thing to a billion dollars.  Imagine a billion copies.  Yeah, no, I think it's a billion dollars. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, it's a billion.  Call of Duty, in 16 days, made one billion dollars for the company.  That's amazing.  Beating the Avatar record.  Yeah.  Because Avatar made a billion dollars in 17 days.  And that's a movie.  Is that possible?  A movie.  Avatar really made a billion dollars in 17 days?  17 days?  Wow.  When you figure that the game itself goes for, you know, about 50 bucks.  Right.  It's not as many people.  But that's, you know, I'm sure Activision Blizzard is pretty fucking happy about that. 
[00:13:30]  That's the company?  Yeah.  I did not know that, sir.  I did not know that.  Yeah, I was playing last night.  And, you know, I like playing with the listeners.  And I got to give what they call, Opie, a shout out.  A shout out.  Nice.  To a drunk golf pro.  He's one of the guys that I play online with.  And I'm playing a game.  And I'm doing it right.  And then I got to jump out of the game because I get the boop. 
[00:14:00]  I get the little message saying, hey, hey, come hang out with us and play with us.  I'm like, okay.  So I hit the button.  I dumps out of my game.  And I get into his game.  He's got a few people there.  And then they start playing a fucking game that I'm just not into.  Demolition.  I don't want to play Demolition.  I don't want to play unless it's hardcore where when you hit someone one or two times with the fucking bullets, they fucking fall down.  I hate when you walk up to somebody, ten shots to the chest, and then they level a shotgun at you and shoot you once and you're dead. 
[00:14:30]  That isn't realistic.  I only play hardcore.  And kill confirmed or team death match.  Yes.  Well, you know, capture the flag one.  But I don't like Demolition.  And I don't like playing pussy fucking shoot them 20 times and they're still alive.  So if you're playing with me, don't play those games.  So you know what I did?  What?  I just dumped out of the game.  I didn't say goodbye or anything.  I just left the game. 
[00:15:00]  No goodbye.  No goodbye.  That's crazy.  It is insane.  But they gotta learn.  Hardcore.  Hardcore is kind of fruity.  What?  No.  When you're fucking running around shooting the same guy five times and then he does the pussy halo jumping.  Oh, I see that all the time in war footage.  The guy jumping around like a pogo stick trying not to get shot.  Stop it. 
[00:15:30]  No.  I like the one fucking shot.  Thank you.  All right.  Put that out of my system.  Very good.  You watch the debate?  No, I didn't last night.  I heard it was a good one because they were all going after Newt.  Well, they're going.  Well, there's the front runner.  But Newt can handle it.  He's the front runner.  That's what I do like about Newt Gingrich.  He can handle what you throw at him.  You know what it is?  You don't give a fuck.  His face just bugs me.  It does, right?  Yeah, he's buggable.  He bugs me.  Newt's been in Washington.  Forever.  He knows how it works.  He's fucking not. 
[00:16:00]  Nothing phases him.  He's already had his personal shit out there, so there's no skeletons you could really pry  out of the closet on him.  And he's got a lot of contacts in foreign affairs and internal affairs, things like that,  you know?  So if they start ripping on him, he's fucking been through it before.  Yeah, I agree.  It's easy for him.  Hasn't everybody who's ever worked for him said that he should not be in charge?  Yeah, probably.  I don't give a shit.  It looks like he's going to be the man unless something crazy happens in the next few weeks, 
[00:16:30]  right?  Because the guy in charge is worse.  That's what it is.  You think he's got a shot at beating Obama in?  I'm not voting for him.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I am going to vote for the Republican candidate for president.  I think the entire world knows that by now.  Yeah.  And I think a lot of Republicans...  You think he has a shot?  I don't know.  I don't know at this point.  I hope so.  I don't want to see four more years of Obama in there.  I don't see the confidence in you.  Because an Obama that really doesn't have to worry about getting re-elected? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, boy.  God knows what else he could fuck up in four years.  Holy shit.  So...  And anybody who wants to curse at me, go ahead.  Because, you know, I'm not going to change your mind.  You're not going to change your mind.  How about if Obama came in here, if we got him as a guest?  A guest?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think they would probably have me removed from the building, because I don't agree with  his policies.  Anytime he does one of those rah-rah, whoop-dee-doo speeches, he's surrounded by people that adore 
[00:17:30]  him.  And won't give him any shenanigans back.  Yeah.  And do you think he's the only politician that does that?  Okay.  No, I'm just saying.  I'm not bringing...  Okay.  The next guy that does it, or the previous guy that did it, that's what I'm talking about.  But, you know, he's the guy that was talking about a change in Washington, and a new thing,  and transparency.  He's been one of the most fucking covert presidents out there.  It's amazing.  Transparency my eyes.  Where's Oprah with the Obama these days?  She was rah-rah. 
[00:18:00]  Well, I don't know.  She's in Haiti.  Well, that's...  She's doing the Haiti thing?  She was filming something over there.  Yeah.  He's got to rock that black vote, is what he's got to do, like he did last time.  And that was to get all the voters in there that were, you know, hey, it's a black guy.  Let's vote for him.  He needs more than that, though.  To keep it, he's got to get a lot of white Democrats that he might have lost.  He's got to get white Democrats.  He's got to get a lot of people that voted for him last time, strictly because he was.  You know, a black guy running for president. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  And people wanted to see it.  Wanted to send a message.  Well, the highlight of the debate last night was good old Rick Perry.  Fucking love this guy.  Again, huh?  And every time he says something, I just think to myself, holy shit, he's the governor of Texas.  Yeah, that Texas just...  I guess it runs itself.  It has to.  I guess Texas really is on autopilot at this point.  And they said over the years, like, being the governor of Texas is like being the president of a smaller country.  Yeah, but you kind of figure now it exposes the whole thing.  I guess it isn't. 
[00:19:00]  I guess it's just he's kind of the figurehead.  And it runs itself?  They just run themselves.  You got to think it runs itself because he doesn't seem to be that smart.  He doesn't seem to be the guy, the take charge kind of guy.  No.  You know.  He loves being governor and it seems like he might enjoy a few pops.  The governor of Texas seems to be a guy that, like, his biggest job is pretty much to not grant clemency to people on death row.  So that's their job.  Rick Perry?  Oh, yeah.  Let them burn.  Yeah.  So this is what Rick Perry said last night. 
[00:19:30]  I'll talk about having the type of part-time Congress that I think Americans are ready for.  And, you know, there are a lot of people out there, I understand it, you know, there are a lot of folks that said Tim Tebow wasn't going to be a very good NFL quarterback.  There are people that stood up and said, well, he doesn't have the right throwing mechanisms or he doesn't, you know, he's not playing the game right.  And, you know, he won two national championships and that looked pretty good.  We were the national champions in job creation back in Texas.  And so, but am I ready for the next level? 
[00:20:00]  Let me tell you, I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses.  Let's break this down.  Wow.  Break it down.  That analogy stung me.  He's terrible.  Do you think he came up with that or his people?  You think he had a flash of brilliance?  Like, holy shit, I'm going to go with the Tebow angle.  To make it young and hip and relevant.  That was almost as bad as Danny's Call of Duty analogy yesterday on the shit show.  It didn't make any sense.  It didn't make any sense.  I didn't understand what he was talking about. 
[00:20:30]  I was driving home perplexed.  That really was a bad analogy.  I mean, that Rick Perry just made.  Oh, yeah.  That was just, what was he trying?  He's trying to get the pop culture thing and, you know, what's in the now.  Right.  And equate it to himself.  He seems to be really dumb.  He stinks.  He stinks.  Stupid.  A lot of people say, I'm like Michael Vick, and we're just going to drown our opponents.  Good one.  Idiot.  He didn't go there.  That was terrible. 
[00:21:00]  Trying to latch on to the whole Tebow phenomenon.  Because how about this, douche?  If you're going to say football, don't say throwing mechanisms.  I know.  Throwing mechanisms.  You don't sound like you know football.  Exactly.  Throwing mechanisms.  Speaking of Tim Tebow, our schools, man, and I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.  Can I leave a little ain't no pussy ain't no sunshine when she's gone? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Do you know, I was thinking when you said the Valby version is ain't no pussy when she's gone.  Oh, right.  It's by hand.  Ain't no pussy when she's gone.  There were times, I think in terms of Valby's song, I literally could not have remembered  Ain't No Sunshine.  Yeah, yeah.  I never would have come today.  The Valby.  I've been talking, I've been talking in song all morning because then I'd go to Anthony,  I didn't sleep at all last night.  And I didn't mean to do that one either.  The fuck?  Tebow, what I was going to say, I know we have a lot of teachers and stuff that listen 
[00:22:00]  to the show, but I got to say, most of these schools just suck.  Yeah.  And what they do to their stupid students.  There's a new phenomenon that's kind of silly, and I certainly wouldn't do it.  I don't think most of our listeners would do it.  I do it all the time.  Me too.  It's called tebowing where you take a knee and you do that tebow pray thing.  I do tebowing where I take a knee in front of a gentleman and suck his cock.  At least you would get something out of that.  That's tebowing.  It's an internet thing. 
[00:22:30]  What are some of the other internet things of the past year?  Planking.  The cats tebowing.  How adorable is that?  That is adorable.  Oh, cats on the internet.  I bet that's going to take off.  Yeah.  I was reading that YouTube's going to do a separate channel for kittens or something.  Anyone else read that?  They are adorable.  I'll watch it.  Because they know how important cats on the internet are.  Oh, yes.  Anyway, internet phenomenons this past year was planking.  What the fuck is planking?  Planking where you just fucking go on top of something and rigidly fucking lay there. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  And you're planking.  So that was an internet phenomenon.  Then what else did we have?  We had that fucking dead horse where you have your head over here and your body over here.  What the fuck was that one called again?  Somebody help me out here.  Jesus Christ.  Let me see.  What's owling?  There's owling too?  What the fuck's owling?  Yeah.  And what's the one I'm talking about?  I don't know.  I'm trying to see.  I know.  Somebody pops up with it. 
[00:23:30]  Owling is where you just sit on a ledge or a railing or something like that and just  get it real tight with your eyes real wide.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, the one you're talking about is called vossing.  Come on.  Help me out, man.  Like you get you and your buddy together.  So you have your head over here, but your buddy's body is you, but it looks like your  head's off your fucking body.  Help me out.  What was it called?  Damn it.  Yeah, I know, Jim Bob.  I just stole your bits.  Sorry.  Um, and then there's one called the Batman, I guess, as well. 
[00:24:00]  The Batman.  I can't move forward until I know the fucking answer to the question.  There's planking.  Yeah.  Planking was huge.  Planking is so dumb.  Look at that.  People died doing it.  I know.  But these websites took off with it.  Yeah.  Like everyone had to have their planking picture and they would put it on their Facebook  and on their Twitter and it made websites.  I don't know what that is.  No one knows the head one.  Come on.  It was, it was, I don't, uh, wow, man, we do talk to a whole different audience.  What is, what, what is it? 
[00:24:30]  It's because I don't even know what it is.  Like I've never seen him.  I would stick my head up over the counter.  Right.  So all you see is my head.  Right.  And then you would make believe you're my body.  How?  And then let's say you, you have your body just thrown across the fucking board here,  but your head's not in picture.  So now it looks like my head.  You'd have to like have your head below.  And then where would your head be?  Over here, let's say.  But that, so it looks like it, it looks like my head got fucking, you know, decapitated.  Chopped off.  Oh, okay. 
[00:25:00]  But what's the name of it?  Oh, well, I didn't understand what you meant it for.  Horse Manning.  Thank you, Robert Slack.  What's it called?  Horse Manning.  It was, it was, it was one of these, it's one of these internet phenomenons.  Why is it called Horse Manning?  I don't know.  I don't know why they came up with that.  Stupid.  See this shit.  Oh.  But everyone had to do a horse Manning fucking, oh.  Oh.  See, you needed your body.  Oh, all right.  You needed your body.  Like a horseman.  Headless horseman.  Oh, the headless horseman.  Oh.  You didn't know this was going on this past year?  No.  This took over the internet for a while. 
[00:25:30]  Everyone had to do their fucking horse Manning picture.  I certainly don't remember this.  Okay, so there was planking, there was horse Manning.  Someone's saying there was a Batman thing that went for a while.  I know horse gagging.  Horse gagging.  That's a good one.  Horse play.  I do that in the shower.  See, look.  See, now you get it.  Now I get it.  You need a buddy, obviously, to make believe he's your body.  Do they have one where it's just under the guy's arm?  Yeah.  Oh, like she's holding her head up.  Yeah, they've done a whole bunch of different ones.  How do they fucking take their real head off, though? 
[00:26:00]  That's pretty impressive.  They're just leaning backwards.  In most cases, they're not photoshopped.  They're just leaning backwards.  Leaning way the fuck over.  Oh, this just sounds like a comedy of errors.  This is the New Millennium.  She's hiding behind the box.  She's not really dead.  Yeah, the New Millennium's version of putting people in a phone booth.  There you go.  Or a Volkswagen.  So now the latest one is kind of just T-bowing.  Where you take a picture of yourself taking a knee and praying, like T-bow does.  They do that in clubs, too. 
[00:26:30]  At nightclubs and shit, where Arnie Fuqua told me, he goes, yeah, he goes, they T-bow in  clubs, on the dance floor, and all those weird places.  Doing the T-bow out there.  That's how I heard about it.  And people are trying to find a weird place to do this, and they put it on their Facebook  and their Twitter, blah, blah, blah.  So you got this school where a bunch of students decided to do this T-bowing in the hallway.  Uh-huh.  Dumb, who gives a shit, makes the fellow students laugh for maybe 30 seconds, tops, if that.  How long do you T-bow for, do you know?  I think it's pretty quick.  Depends on how much you adore Jesus. 
[00:27:00]  So stupid superintendent saw this going on in the hall and suspended the kids.  What a fucking douchebag.  And said, you know, with them in the hallway, first of all, it's a distraction.  And if, God forbid, there was a fire or a fire alarm goes off, it could cause havoc in  the hallway.  It's like, you know, we got a bunch of kids taking a knee in the hallway and a fire alarm  goes off.  It could be havoc.  Yeah, because it's so hard to stand up when you're a kid.  Look.  It's so hard to stand up from your knee.  What I'll never, ever understand is school sucks. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Most kids hate going to school.  And so what does the school system do?  They make it even harder and make it suck even more.  Why would you try to make school fun?  Oh, no.  You got to beat them down.  Why, though?  I don't know.  What does that teach?  It gives them a sense of authority.  Really?  Yeah.  You got to keep up.  You got to break them down.  You build them up.  You kill them with just hours and hours of nonsense schoolwork that means nothing in 
[00:28:00]  the end.  Yeah.  Because it's just, you know, you just know what I learned in school to memorize real  well.  Yeah.  None of it sunk in.  I didn't learn anything I know in school.  I learned everything just on my own, hanging out, reading whatever I wanted to read.  Wow.  That's a great fucking thought.  Let me think.  Yeah.  You say nothing?  Well, maybe a couple of things about like, you know, the Louisiana Purchase.  I was really good at math.  I've said it many times on the show, but past ninth grade? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They didn't teach me anything I used to this day.  No.  No.  I would bet 10 to 20% of everything I know I learned in school.  Yeah?  Maybe.  You're right.  That's a lot.  It was more a life lesson than a fucking school thing.  You know, that whole learn how to hang out with people and talk and be awkward and with  girls and all that shit was like part of growing up.  And that was, that was an education.  We move forward with so many things in society, but then it's the same old shit like in our 
[00:29:00]  school systems.  I don't get it.  And, and, and actually making it worse where you have kids like blowing it, you know, just  having a quick little moment of fun in their stupid heads.  And, and you got a superintendent that says, nope, we can't have this and suspends the  kids.  Yeah.  They're not selling weed or getting drunk.  It's so stupid, stupid, stupid, taking a knee, right?  Take a knee and you get in trouble.  That's, that's pretty dumb.  Uh, Riverhead High School.  Oh, uh-oh.  Was this Long Island at?  Riverhead, uh, New York.  Oh boy.  Riverhead High School. 
[00:29:30]  Riverhead's not the nicest area.  What does the picture look like?  Uh, all white.  Oh.  Because I know that's what you're wondering.  Of course.  That's what I mean by, you know, well, yeah.  I'll read the first paragraph.  Someone told me a long time ago, the first two paragraphs of every story is all you need.  Especially if you're on radio.  Who, what, where, when, how.  Yeah.  And then the rest is, they just got to fill up space.  Yeah.  You know, I know that guy, fill up space.  Try it at home.  You'll see.  You read the first two paragraphs of, oops, of every story and that's all you'll need. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  Uh, the Tebow.  I'm sorry, my fingers actually stopped turning the page on that Phillip joke.  I couldn't hear it.  I'm sorry.  I'm an idiot.  Did you hear what he said?  No.  Oh.  I'm an idiot.  You said, what did you say, Phillip space?  The rest is just a Phillip space.  And Anthony goes, I know him, Phillip space.  My fucking fingers stopped working.  It was horrible.  What are you going to do?  I'll put that on purpose.  The Tebow mania sweeping the nation sacked a group of Long Island high school students  who were suspended for mimicking the quarterback's famous prayer pose. 
[00:30:30]  Twin brothers Tyler and Connor and classmates Jordan and Wayne were hit with one day suspensions  for kneeling and bowing their heads like Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow does when he scores a touchdown.  How do you get suspended?  Administrators said the week-long T-bowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard  after dozens of classmates followed their lead.  Well.  God, what an unfun environment school is.  It's just horrendous.  You wonder why your fucking kids are turning out to be a bunch of dumb cunts. 
[00:31:00]  What an unfun environment.  You know it's a guy that has power and has to fucking just be the power guy.  He knows damn well it wasn't bothering anybody.  Harmless.  Uh, it was basically just a tribute.  All right.  Then they explained.  See, you don't need any of this other shit.  It's stupid, but it's not a suspendable fucking little thingy.  No.  And, uh, these students were warned and did it again.  Oh, boy.  Carney said.  If the kids aren't going to abide by rules, there are consequences. 
[00:31:30]  This guy's crazy.  But they shouldn't have been warned in the first place because now you're just making up shit  because you're in charge.  Ah.  Which a lot of you idiots do out there.  Get a little power and you have to make shit up.  Oh, no.  They stopped and tebowed.  Right.  Yeah.  Then he had to say it's not about religion because that came up.  Oh, you don't like, uh, you know, religion?  It is about being sure kids are able to get to class on time and keeping the kids safe 
[00:32:00]  and orderly.  Oh, God.  I fucking hate people who work in schools.  Isn't this hateable?  I heard this on the way in.  I'm like, you've got to be shitting me.  Terrible.  It's just like that school where the principal had to carry around a bat.  Yeah.  Joe Clark.  With the bullhorn.  Yeah.  Exactly.  This slovenly sloppy boy.  He's very funny.  Yeah.  He grabs a fat kid and makes an example out of him.  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Is this guy available today?  I would love to get him on the phone and give him a talking to.  A talking to?  I love giving a talking to an authority. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, this guy probably.  Jimmy's amazed that no one's here.  I can see it.  This place never, never stops to amaze me.  It's the logic that is used in this place.  Oh, my God.  Lack thereof.  Yes, yes.  Comes down to a staff has a better contract than us.  And like I said, I'm not trashing those guys.  God fucking bless them.  And I hope they're enjoying their days off. 
[00:33:00]  No.  It just shows how dumb these people down the hall are.  I don't get it.  Nope.  So we'll try to get this guy on the phone.  What is that?  The video?  Yes.  Oh.  So there's a video online of these guys doing it.  I'm going to turn their phone.  T-Bowling suspensions.  Riverhead High School students, athletes suspended for this.  Jalen, I got you.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  Amen.  God bless. 
[00:33:30]  I'm in a blast.  Postal is dumb.  It's dumb.  It's just silly.  T-Bow.  Get up, man.  Get up.  Go.  They're blocking traffic on the hallway.  Are they?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They're really that close to you.  I love them.  Now I agree.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  T-Bow.  I had it.  Everybody's T-Bow.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm getting into this.  T-Bow.  They should be doing the Sandusky. 
[00:34:00]  Sandusky.  That's where one puts their crooked fingers under their eyes like they're crying.  And one stands behind them like he just won a gift.  Look, it's stupid.  You know, when you're our age, you look at that and it's kind of dumb and stupid.  But you remember back to high school, you would come up with dumb, silly shit.  You're doing dumb things.  That, you know, made you just fucking chuckle in between dumb periods.  Yeah.  What's the problem there, really?  Beating up other kids.  What's the problem there, seriously?  I don't see much of a problem there except for the, you know, hey, the hallway traffic 
[00:34:30]  was a little backed up.  Yeah, someone's saying, well, I'm assuming you learned to read and write in school.  Yeah.  But at what grade?  At what grade was that?  So there's a lot of years wasted in school.  All right, look, maybe I wasn't specific enough.  Yeah, in the first, second, maybe third grade, I was learning some stuff other than that.  What level of math do you need to get by in society?  Seriously.  The average person?  What do you think?  As long as you could add, subtract, multiply, and divide, you're golden. 
[00:35:00]  That's it, right?  You're golden.  So when do you learn that?  I don't know anymore.  Fuck, that's like the sixth grade.  So why did we have to take math from sixth grade all the way to twelfth grade?  Unless you had a special talent where you really needed this to move on in your future  career.  And you already know who those kids are by sixth grade.  You really do.  Yeah.  I think after, you know, yeah, after sixth grade, then it's like if you're remedial,  if you're adult, then, you know. 
[00:35:30]  And most of us, I've heard over the years that all you need is really an eighth grade  reading level to get by in society.  Probably.  And I think that's even high.  It's probably more than a lot of people have.  I've noticed so many people that just can't fucking read.  It's amazing how dumb they are.  Remember the kids in school that would be like,  Oh, it was fucking ponderous. 
[00:36:00]  My friend one time was trying to read an ad for a washing machine and he couldn't do it.  He was just sitting there going, washing, washing, machine.  And then the teacher asked him to read in class.  Oh, when people had to read aloud.  He's like, I said I can read.  And she's like, Mr. Johnson is going to read.  Mr. Johnson.  Same.  Let me go to Chris, the teacher. 
[00:36:30]  He's a regular to the show.  He wants to defend his profession.  I know there's a bunch of teachers out there, you know,  really trying to do the right thing and make it interesting for the students.  But in general, it's a lot of bullshit.  Let's be honest with each other.  Chris, what do you got on this?  How you doing, boys?  First of all, I'm still laughing because Anthony actually saw the video of the Riverhead kids doing it  and eventually disagreed after he saw the video.  So I'm still laughing at that.  Yes.  I'm a hoot.  He didn't. 
[00:37:00]  I was going to say.  I know.  Wait, wait, Chris.  Chris, because now I'm confused.  You know Ant was fucking around, right?  Yeah.  I don't really disagree.  He doesn't disagree with this.  No, I do.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I laughed.  Oh, OK.  He laughed at the irony.  A lot of laughter in this show.  I know what you're looking at out there.  Yeah.  It's silly.  Oh, no.  He thinks you saw a lot of black kids.  Right, Chris?  I didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  Well, how about you be brave enough and say it?  Yes.  There are a lot of schwulks.  Just say it.  Oh, no. 
[00:37:30]  But that's not what the actual video.  You don't even see black kids.  Well, there's a couple, but.  Jeez, you really, really see color then.  Yeah, this guy.  Jesus.  You counted them and profiled them immediately?  Yeah.  Yes, Chris.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  Sorry.  If I saw this stuff happening, I probably would have did it with them, because I think it's  funny.  But, you know, you'll look at the football coach in the paper, also agrees with them, agrees 
[00:38:00]  with the administration, because he's got to back then, and a couple of teachers agree  with it, but I'm sure that they don't.  But as far as what you learn in school, I will tell you, it sounds like bullshit.  It has changed a lot since you guys were there, and since I was there, it used to be just  rote memorization.  Now, we're really trying to teach them how to, honestly, just, like, critically think  and question stuff.  You guys were in what was called the post-modern educational world or something like that. 
[00:38:30]  We're in the modern educational world.  The Mesozoic era.  Damn.  That's where we were.  We learned about dinosaurs.  Honestly.  That's all we learned about.  You have to remember.  That's all I knew about at that point.  What?  Sorry.  Yeah, you go.  It's your show.  You go.  Honestly, I try to make it.  As a teacher, we can finally go, shut up.  Exactly.  Teach.  Shut up.  You got all the references. 
[00:39:00]  Every morning, you guys.  I'm starting to make my job tolerable.  Well, Chris, now that I'm a parent, I certainly hope it's different.  But I see the kids.  I happen to live pretty close to a school, matter of fact, and I have to pass the school.  To do my everyday shit.  I see you pass every day.  Playing I'm in the school.  Doing horrible things.  And I see these kids coming down the hill with their goddamn book bags, and it weighs about 50 pounds.  It's because they just kill these kids with homework and textbooks. 
[00:39:30]  I'm like, you're already stressing out the kids.  They're only fucking seven, eight years old, and you're already putting that incredible stress on them.  Yeah.  Why?  Why do we do that?  We just had a rubber strap.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  Remember the rubber strap?  That was good for...  I forgot all about that.  ...for stretching out and smacking ass with.  Right.  Well, Opie, why we do that is we're really trying to teach them essential skills, such as time management.  Nah, I think you're just... 
[00:40:00]  ...envolicing their days.  Nah.  I'm not in the profession.  I would bet a lot of money it's just to keep them busy.  I was.  You got to teach your responsibility, for real.  I don't give it to them every night.  Because you do know what ends up happening, and I'm talking to a lot of fucking parents right now.  You assholes give them so much homework and stress out the kids so much.  Guess who's doing the homework every night?  And guess the same people that are working nine to five and trying to make a living.  Now they got to go home and do schoolwork like they're back in school.  You watch these phones light up, Anthony.  You watch. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  My sister...  You're part of the problem.  My sister and her husband, they spent half their nights doing the actual homework for their kids.  Well, they should let the kids...  They should tell the kids, you do your homework.  That's my contribution.  You'll see.  They'll call up now.  You got guys working full-time jobs, and then they have to go home and do schoolwork.  The homework was the worst part of school for me.  I could not fucking do homework.  When I got home, done. 
[00:41:00]  I didn't want to deal with thinking about school.  I didn't do homework.  And then I didn't have the homework, so it prevented me from going to the class the next day.  Right.  So then I take...  That's how it worked out for you.  I have a few days off from that class, and then I had to steer clear of the whole side of the building,  and it wound up fucking me over because I wouldn't go to class because of the homework.  See?  Look, good fucking, great fucking thing, homework.  We'll be the first to admit we lucked out.  I was either going to be a radio fucking star or a lifetime caddy.  There was nothing in between for me, man. 
[00:41:30]  When's your tea time?  Anthony, I need some duct work done in my house to help me out.  Yeah, exactly.  But why shouldn't...  As soon as the school day's over, shouldn't that be it?  Why are we sending our kids home with a shitload of homework?  That's dumb.  That means you're not doing your job in class.  Oh.  You should be able to teach everything to the kid within the hours of school.  But they have to practice the skills.  They don't have to do shit.  I happily stay after and will help them with their homework. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, Chris, that's bullshit.  Because once you get to regular life, who's really going home from work  and taking the Penske file home with them and working on it?  But they have to put it in the accordion-style folder.  Well, that's true.  There's a guy that knows his Seinfeld.  I got a question for you, though, for real.  We get a lot of kids with stuff that need accommodations, like extra time.  They can't fill out scantrons.  They don't have to get to school on time because they have school anxiety. 
[00:42:30]  What if they go to fucking work?  And the guy's like, the boss tells them to do something.  And the guy's like, I have extra time.  And the boss is like, go fuck yourself.  What do you guys think about that as far as the accommodations that we got?  I phased out on this question.  Dude, I swear to God, I was just about to say that.  I feel like I'm back in school.  I know.  Could you say that again?  I swear to God.  I phased out.  I think all three of us phased out.  Yeah.  I was about to say that and it beat me to the punch.  I swear to you, I have no idea what he said. 
[00:43:00]  Go ahead.  So sorry.  We got to make a lot of accommodations for the kids that are never going to work in the  real world.  How do you feel about that?  What kind of accommodations do you mean?  Yeah.  Are you fucking with me?  No, I'm actually, I mean, you said we have to make a lot of accommodations for kids.  We have to give a lot of extra time on tests.  We have to have the directions right to them sometimes.  I understand it.  It's part of their IEPs.  Dumb kids you're talking about.  Yeah.  Dummies.  Yeah.  You got to do it.  I mean, they have to get the same education.  Apparently what you do is you write stupid on their forehead. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, did you hear about that teach that did that?  He did.  Oh, yeah.  Some kid wasn't understanding something, so he wrote stupid on his forehead, and now  they're having all kinds of meetings to get him thrown out.  How do you think that's going to work out as a teacher?  I know.  That's stupid, too, right?  Well.  I say bring back the dunce cap.  The dunce cap was great.  Was that ever a real thing, or is that just something that has been used in movies to the 
[00:44:00]  point where you just think it was real?  I bet it was real.  I bet at one point someone did it.  Was there really a dunce cap and truant officers that would go around to gather up kids that  were playing hooky?  We need truant officers and dunce caps.  Yeah, let's bring back the dunce cap.  The dunce cap.  That's funny.  We really should make one for this place.  Make a dummy wear it for his last day.  No, we should all wear it for being here.  That is true.  We are dunces.  And speaking of school, what happened at that other school where kids were making out  with their own parents?  What the fuck was that about? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, fuck.  There's another story in the paper.  Hot high school?  What?  There's another story in the papers in the papers today about a teacher.  This guy's a movie reference dude.  A movie reference teacher.  That's what they call it.  Movie reference.  He's gone.  Yeah.  I'm fucking loaded.  I got to get all my funny out now.  Oh, well.  I think you're done.  A teacher stabbed another teacher.  You guys see that in the paper about a teacher stabbed a teacher like 61 times or something?  Was it accidental?  No, they had a screwdriver on them. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know where they teach, but this is legit.  My wife's a teacher, too.  Oh, you're blown away.  What?  What about the fucking parents making out with their students?  I've never heard of that.  Or their kids, whatever.  Sam's got the story way better than your story.  Yeah.  Well, two people got to stand.  It was good.  I got to go on.  Although, we do need a producer, so if you want to come on in for a few hours before the class starts.  I'm going to find the class right now, man.  Jimmy just hits the console.  He's like, throws his arms up.  See, I really have, and I hope the listeners understand, I really have changed the corner. 
[00:45:30]  At this point, it's just all laughable to me.  I used to get so mad and frustrated by all of this.  I really don't.  Maybe it doesn't come across that way still on the air, but it's just so laughable to me.  It's me, Eric, and Troy dominating.  But look at Jimmy.  He's biting his own teeth.  I just don't get it.  I'm not angry.  I just was like, ugh.  I know.  It just happened.  I don't know.  All right, boys.  I got to go teach the youth of America.  I love you guys.  See you, buddy.  All right, Chris.  Good luck.  No, I was just going to give you a compliment. 
[00:46:00]  I know those guys like you trying to do the right thing, and guys like you out there,  and maybe trying to change the system a little bit.  But it seems like a lot of you guys have an uphill battle on your hands.  Well, we can't change the system.  We've got to do the best we can with this system as it is.  And it's broken.  We're not going to lie.  And I do know this.  I do have knowledge on this, just because I have a lot of nephews and nieces,  and I hear my siblings bitching all the time about how ridiculous a lot of this shit is.  Is any system working? 
[00:46:30]  Every time there's a system, it's like, hey, the system's broken.  The system's broken.  It's like, where is the system that's working?  Why do we continue to break all our systems?  Our systems are all busted.  Why?  I don't know.  Look at this place.  Look at this place.  It's radio.  When the system breaks down.  This is radio.  Yeah.  It doesn't get much easier than what we do for a living.  And they fuck it up.  This system's broken.  Why?  Why do they fuck it up?  I don't know.  Our system just, like, hemorrhages money. 
[00:47:00]  And we're facing a lot of cutbacks.  Like, my wife's going to get canned this year.  And this is not because she's going to get cut back.  And I got a half a million dollars shoebox in Nassau County.  Who usually hangs up on these people?  Why is your wife getting canned?  Oh, I do.  Is she, like, going to be sold as a food or something on a shoe?  Oh, I had a good one.  I'm getting this in.  There's still truant officers in the NYPD.  Chris is wrong.  Ope is right.  Sweet gig.  We aren't allowed to teach anything interesting.  There's lesson plans that some idiot comes up with, and you have to follow that shit. 
[00:47:30]  Well, that system's busted.  So that guy has to be the one that's creative and knows his way around.  But being creative means taking risks, and they don't want to do that.  They don't want to get fired.  You know what system isn't busted?  The Dewey Decimal System.  That's true.  That one has just been working for years.  And it's fun.  And it's not busted.  Who doesn't love a good Dewey Decimal System party on a Friday?  Who doesn't love going and perusing the 800s?  Pure science.  Anthony, this guy, Jim.  I love it.  I don't feel like talking.  Better than literature. 
[00:48:00]  He says, I'm contradicting myself because we also say the Chinese are smarter.  No, you're not, OPSU are.  A contradictory joke.  But what do you think?  I don't know the Chinese culture, but what are they doing differently in schools?  I don't know.  Threats?  Is it like China, China, or Chinese people here?  I think, well, now I've got to talk to them.  Jim, what are you saying, buddy?  Hey, guys.  First off, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Wow. 
[00:48:30]  Secondly, you only have a small period of time to get information into these kids.  Okay.  Give them as much information as possible.  Try to let them out in the world and pray for the best.  You know what I'm doing?  My kid is officially 19 months old, which drives people crazy because I guess I'm supposed to  say a year and seven months.  Or a year and something.  I think you do the month thing until two years old, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  You didn't say a year and a half when it was a year and a half?  I did say a year and a half, but now it's, what do I say for 19 months?  Eh, you go a year and a half. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Did you say around a year and a half?  Bah.  A little more than a year and a half.  And actually, out there in kid land, that makes your kid look even smarter.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, yeah, he's only a year and a half.  But he's actually.  Oh, he's so big.  But a year and seven months is a big difference, I guess.  I'm rounding down.  I'm making my housekeeper there, cleaning lady, teach him dirty Spanish.  Whoa.  Oh, he'll have to know that.  It's the same cleaning lady that Jimmy's got.  And I told her, teach him the dirty shit. 
[00:49:30]  Not dirty words, but the dirty Spanish.  Not that proper crap.  Yeah.  Spanish.  Oh, I thought you meant dirty words.  No.  So the whole time she's in my apartment, she talks Spanish to the kid.  I say, fucking no English, man.  Just Spanish it up.  Yeah.  I can't wait until you try to talk to him and he doesn't understand what you're saying.  Well, I do pretty well.  He'll be like, mira, mira.  Mira.  She laughs at me because I'm just horrendous with my Spanish.  Dame un beso.  And then I just throw O's on the end of English words. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm going to Spanish.  That's the Lucy Ricardo Spanish.  But look at Sam.  He knows this shit.  And he had the same thing growing up, right?  Yeah.  You didn't learn Spanish in school, did you?  No, no, no.  I actually, I didn't do well in Spanish in school because I didn't do anything in Spanish.  No, why?  Because they teach you the proper shit.  They can't even do that correctly.  I didn't know what they were talking about.  I learned real Spanish because, yeah, my mom and dad had a feeling.  They said the Spanish they teach you in school, you have to be like royalty.  Royalty.  It's so proper that the average Latino on the street doesn't know what you're saying when 
[00:50:30]  you try to apply what you learned in school.  Different dialect?  Yes.  That's smart that I teach him Spanish.  You've got to know it, man.  They say, I mean, he soaks in shit like a sponge.  It works.  Fuck, man.  I say, just speak Spanish the entire time you're here.  She does when she's on the phone anyway.  What's worse than when you try to do something and she's babbling on the phone?  She fucking chatty Cathy.  You know, I meant to talk to you about this.  Who does she call?  I have no idea.  Probably someone else in cleaning someone else's apartment.  But I don't think we're getting the phone bill because my phone bill isn't changing. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, she's on her cell phone at my place.  No, she has to use my phone.  If she tried to use my phone, I would fucking let her.  No problem.  I get an army of Hispanics in my house.  Yeah, I know.  They come in.  Oh, my God.  The vacuum cleaners are going.  They're fucking dusting shit.  They're fucking washing stuff, stealing.  Stealing.  Putting guns in their pockets.  And they're all, like, yapping Spanish to each other.  And then I walk in the door and it's like, hello, Anthony.  How are you today?  I'm like, work. 
[00:51:30]  Get to work.  Don't look me in the eye.  See, I would have said work-o.  El work-o.  El work-o.  El work-o.  That's exactly how I do it, too.  It's so embarrassing.  Our housekeeper has awful toes.  Ew.  Do you ever look at her toes, Ope?  They're not good.  No.  What do they look like?  They're a little fucked up.  Just fucking macadamia nuts.  Oh, God.  And her hiney crack pops at her once in a while.  I don't like that.  She's a nice little rump.  Even though I'm not attracted to her.  Does the tree come in there when she's-  Well, it's weird because her hiney crack pops at her once in a while and she has a long, 
[00:52:00]  very long ponytail that kind of starts hanging out.  Oh, diddles it in there?  She must get a lot of wild hairs up her ass in the shower.  I don't think she means it, though.  I think she's just doing her thing.  No, she doesn't.  She's not flirty.  No, not at all.  She bumped my penis one time by mistake.  Oh, wow.  No, no, no, no.  I was helping her take a-  A shit?  My humidifier.  Yes.  I was helping her take a shit.  She asked for a boost.  No, we were taking my humidifier, the filter off it, and it was a complete accident. 
[00:52:30]  Nobody acknowledged it.  I didn't have a rod or anything.  Chinese guy, so what do you want to say?  You guys basically proved my point.  The kids are young.  They're going to absorb it like a sponge.  Give them as much info as possible.  You're going to be tough out there.  They're not all fucking geniuses like you guys.  No, we're not geniuses, sir.  I am.  But I think Anthony made a really good point that I think a lot of people out there certainly 
[00:53:00]  could relate to.  How much knowledge that you use today did you actually learn in school?  And I bet you that percentage is very low, sir.  Yeah, but I mean, I started working at 13, and that was it.  That's Japanese, though.  That's right.  It's just a different point.  Yeah, it's like Chinese.  What is that?  It sounds like a Chinese junk ship.  I heard turning Japanese in there. 
[00:53:30]  It's me playing joke.  Me make pee-pee in your Coke.  Oh, shit.  Why did that sound like turning Japanese a little bit?  It's the beginning of turning Japanese, yeah.  Oh, okay.  You scared me.  Hey, I've got to run into the office.  I'm punching out.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend, guys.  Bye.  I think part of it is we're teaching our kids a lot of just nonsense instead of maybe,  you know, know what I would have liked to learn when I was in high school?  How to fucking do a mortgage.  Yes.  I know that's an old gag and an old bit, but stuff that I could have fucking really used.  Isn't that the GED stuff?  Like, they teach you, we're going to teach you how to balance a checkbook, and you're 
[00:54:00]  like, ooh, wow, now I'm learning shit.  I thought they should teach you in a regular school.  When I finally bought a house, I was lost.  I'm like, this would have been nice to know this shit.  I just know you sign a lot of papers and checks.  And hope that they're not screwing you over.  And you wince and go like, oh, God, give me the keys, give me the keys.  I don't want to sign anymore, and I got the keys.  Yeah.  Why do you have to put your initials on a thousand documents?  Initial, initial.  Here, right here.  Okay, here and here. 
[00:54:30]  Over here.  Okay, good.  Okay, here and here.  Okay, good.  Here, here, and here.  Okay, and if you could sign that and date that there.  Okay, good.  Oh, God.  I know.  It takes forever.  Don't you love the idiot tags they put on there?  The little yellow things?  Sign here, sign here, sign here.  I love those.  I'm an idiot tag guy.  I love those things.  I love those.  They rule.  And then I stick them on my face as I sign, so by the end, I have them all over my face,  and I go, brrrr.  No, I put them all over the house, and then deaf people just start to do it.  Start talking, whoever they are.  Get it?  Can they sign? 
[00:55:00]  Brilliant.  We don't need to talk to more teachers, because I think we figured it all out tonight.  We don't need what?  No teachers.  Yeah.  I don't talk to the teach.  Sounds like an SFP song.  Yeah.  Let's walk right in there.  What's up, daddy-o?  Daddy-o?  You're talking the rock and roll lingo.  Daddy-o.  Yeah, what it is, daddy-o?  What it is?  I don't do homework.  Can we turn off the lights? 
[00:55:30]  Homework's for squares.  Yeah.  I didn't do my homework, teach.  Quinton, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah, I was just, what's up, boys?  I was just talking about, I wanted to talk about, I think it was Boston Cathedral High School.  Before, the dude was running in for a touchdown, he put up his hand for like two seconds, and he was in the Florida State championship, and they kind of, they gave him a penalty. 
[00:56:00]  So he walked the game by putting up his hand for like two seconds.  He's deflating my energy balloon.  All right, fair enough.  He's done.  Fair enough.  And he's got his radio going.  Fair enough.  Right with you.  How about Eats?  You want to break?  Yeah, we should break.  Oh, God.  Sam Roberts has a paper for me.  I look at my sandwich, and I'm like, oh, good, we're going to break.  I'm going to bite into that sandwich, and then I get a piece of paper thrust in front of me.  Going to eat breakfast. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, no.  People say, why haven't we played this yet?  Pretty good.  Taking my time on the la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Watching the leaves, boiling the river, la-la-la.  Second.  Like la-la-la-la-la.  Dacking all the halls with the la-la-la-la.  Making my way to the la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  La la la la la la la... 
[00:57:00]  La la la la...  I like to drink a little beer  At the end of the day  Go walking in the town  Be like a million miles away  Now the snow is like a sea  Like a sand above the beach  The lights popping in the trees 
[00:57:30]  The people shining in the street  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night  Sirius X-Hands, the O.P. and Anthony show  I need an amazing friend 
[00:58:00]  I do, with a head to land  I do, I think you fit this shoe  I do, but you have a clue  Take advantage, right?  You hate me, I have to try  But I can't see you every night 
[00:58:30]  Free  Getting topical  Hold up, wait a minute  With the Sex Man  Good morning, sexy  Hello  By the way, I would have went with  An illustrated book about birds  Yeah, I like this song  What do we got today, sexy? 
[00:59:00]  Well, 18 years ago, MTV aired Nirvana Unplugged  18 years ago  If you want to feel old  Fuck  Wowie, kazowie  So, I like doing this  18 years ago, it was what?  1993, maybe?  So then I like to go, alright, now I'm in 1993  What happened 18 years ago if you're in 1993?  Right, right  And that brings us back to 75  Wow  So as much time has passed from 93 till now 
[00:59:30]  Has passed from 75 to 93  So when you were in 1993  You could look back at something from 1975  The same way you'd look back from now to 93  I know you're mocking me  No, I do that all the time  But do you get what I'm sort of saying?  I do it all the time, I swear  Oh, okay, because when you're in 1993  You're like, okay, here's current time  And then you go, 18 years ago, that's 75  I can't even really relate to that anymore  But here we are in 2011 relating to something like it was yesterday in 1993 
[01:00:00]  I know, it's fucked up  Do you get this or you're fucking with me?  No, I swear, I do that a lot  I wasn't sure if I was the only one that did dumb things like that  Because it's all, you know, relative of how you felt about time passing back then  Right  You know, it's kind of weird  Okay, good  Oh, yeah  Because like U2  They've been doing it for  U2, I think they're up to 30 years now  30  Actually, a little more  I think they kind of got going in the late 70s, right?  Maybe 79  Yeah  With some of their shit  Let's call it 30 years 
[01:00:30]  Wow  So then 30 years ago was 1981  You remember it, 1981  Sure, too  30 years ago from 1981 is 1951  And you would sit there like, that's stupid  That's  That's a real long time ago  Yeah  That's a  Exactly  Even before that, it's still fucking  Yes, Sam  That's crazy music  They were actually formed in 76  You too?  Yeah  Yeah, but they were doing like weird little fucking playing for their friends gigs  They're also the number one act of 2011 right now 
[01:01:00]  Why didn't you play them then?  Because  What a dick  What do you mean?  This was the anniversary  On the Forbes top 25 musicians list for the end of the year  They're number one  Making the most money  How are they number one?  They didn't have the greatest album out  You know what, Iroh?  Touring and stuff  I didn't like your sexy selection  Well, the other one I wanted to go with  Did you want to hear the runner-up?  No, no  I'm going to guess the runner-up  Okay  I'm going to guess  I'm going to too  I don't even have to look at it 
[01:01:30]  And I know exactly which one you should have done  Okay  You want to see it at the same time?  Okay  Ready?  Hold on  I've got to make sure though  Ready?  Oh yeah  It's absolutely  This is the one you should have done  Ready?  Friday  Friday  Friday  Oh fuck  Where were you next?  What?  You didn't have that?  Wasn't even a runner-up  Where were you, dude?  Iroh, what was your runner-up?  Don McClain, I betcha  What?  Well, I was going to do The Who as well  What?  I'm going to think outside the box every now and then  Who cares?  The Who disbanded 28 years ago 
[01:02:00]  They never disbanded  That was just a publicity thing  Through your tears  Right  They never disbanded  I think they're still playing  Photogs  So they technically disbanded for the first time  With their fake retirement shit  Did they?  I think they disbanded  When Keith Moon  Fucking OD'd  That's when The Who stopped existing  Nah, man  That's The Who, I mean  Come on  I know  I like their after  Let's not forget Eminence Front, sir  Eminence Front  I hear it's a put-on 
[01:02:30]  It's a put-on  Yeah, it's getting at the world's  Oh wait, what is this now?  It's Google  No, that's actually Google's  Google searches  Top searches for 2011  All right, what was in this list?  You had  Rebecca Black was the number one search in 2011  Oh, you gave it away  That old game  Yes  All right, go with number 10  10  iPad 2 is the most searched  Oh, look at that  10th most searched  Yes 
[01:03:00]  Then Steve Jobs  Steve Jobs  And then  And then  Oh, I thought  I thought pubic hair  Yeah, that's some kind of Japanese writing  What is that?  How is that?  I would assume it's the nuclear  The Fukushima  Nuclear Power Plant  But none of us fucking write that way  So how is that one of the top searched things?  Is there other people than us?  No, there's not  Oh  That's dumb  Why would you look at the world that way?  It's all about us  It's crazy  You look like bugs  How the fuck do you learn that? 
[01:03:30]  I don't know  What does that eight-legged bug mean?  We were talking about school  How the fuck?  I'm gonna try to learn that  How are you  What?  What is that?  Yeah, just grab Rosetta Stone  And she's gonna tell you how to fucking figure that out  What are we looking at?  Good idea  Seriously  We're looking at  We're looking at like  Match the Hats shit  As a language  The first one looks like a hi-hat symbol  Yes, very good  With a snare in front of it  Very good  The second one looks like  Looks like a TV with a sombrero on it 
[01:04:00]  A TV with a sombrero on it  Yeah, yeah  The third one's a cat  With a tail  Wait, a cat?  Yeah, it's like a  Oh, fuck  I see the cat  With a little tail  Very good  And then the last one is  The international sign for wheelchair  It does  So you put all that together  And you're supposed to understand what that says?  That it's the Fukushima nuclear power plant  No, that's stupid  I don't understand Asian writing  How the fuck do they make sense of that nonsense? 
[01:04:30]  I don't know how they fit it into a keyboard  Dude, it looks exhausting, doesn't it?  Yes  How do they use a keyboard?  Keyboard?  How do you write it?  It's like you're fucking making art every time you write anything  And is that script?  Ah, hmm  Is that cursive?  Every book  Cursive  Block letters  It really is stupid  God, it must take hours to write anything  Ah  Right?  But why do they decide on that?  Don't they go back to  Which way do they read right to left?  Oh, who the hell knows?  Up and down  It's all over the place  Don't they understand how much easier English is? 
[01:05:00]  So why do they do that?  How many characters do they have?  Of course  Try that L and R stuff  That gets a little complicated  Ah, true  True  Yeah  But besides that  It's an easy language for us  Yeah  How many characters do they have?  I'm going to go with 200  No, I think they have less characters, don't they?  Than us?  I have no idea  No, they couldn't  They couldn't  They couldn't  They couldn't  Sam, please find it ready  Danny would have had this  How many characters in the Japanese alphabet?  It's a combination of three scripts 
[01:05:30]  Chinese characters called kanji  Two syllabic or murai scripts, of course, as we speculated  Oh, yeah  Of modified Chinese characters, hiragana  And the Latin alphabet, romaji  I have no idea  Oh my god, my brain just exploded  I can't even read how many characters there are and not be frustrated  I know  What the fuck?  Dialects and official status and classification  There's no number  Look, I got a 19 month old  Do you think I could teach him the chinky stuff?  Oh  Don't call it that  I'm serious 
[01:06:00]  Can I teach him how to write that?  Not me, but if I  Give him a crayon  I'll scribble, it'll say something  Yeah  Man, fuck  I don't understand  Oh, Sam  What's it mean?  Sam, why are you farting?  I didn't  I just don't get  I ripped one right next to Sam  I'm amazed in foreign language how they can look at this and make sense of it  I mean, you ever see a Chinese guy reading a newspaper?  I want to go like, what are you doing?  He's just faking it out of it  Are you really getting knowledge from that?  He's looking at the pictures and faking it  It just stresses you out  Oh, man, look at this kayaker 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, man  He died  He survived, I thought  I was just trying to say something  What happened with Christian Bale getting all roughed up in China?  Yeah  What happened?  He probably made fun of their alphabet  I don't know  I don't know  Maybe  He's a weirdo  He's trying to visit somebody under house arrest  Oh, they didn't like that  There's security around him  That means he yelled at him  Fucking amateur  Get on their shit  They tend to frown on that  What about the kayak guy?  I heard it was 95 feet  He thinks he's actually Batman  Maybe he does  Yeah, somebody that's trying to make bats 
[01:07:00]  Ah, that's good  All right, let's go back to the top searches  So that weird language is up there  Yeah, that's the Japanese earthquake and such  And then number seven is Adele  Adele  She's good, man  She's a shit  Chubby  Yeah  I just wish I never saw a picture of her  I know  Because I had an image of what she looked like  Sultry  Like that light-skinned black  I was thinking with nice boobies  What?  She's cute there, though  And, you know, pillow lips  Yeah, she's better there  But she's pretty there  She's big  Pillow lips  Yeah  Is that racist? 
[01:07:30]  That's a  Pillow lips?  Yeah  White girls have pillow lips, too, man  Oh, okay  Yeah  She's always standing with a farmer  Her voice doesn't match  Why?  Her voice doesn't match her face, man  Because her name's Adele  Oh, the farmer and Adele  Farmer and Adele  I write enough of her  They clean her up nice  But, see, that's what she really looks like  Is that her?  She looks like fucking Winona Judd when she was younger  Yeah, she sucks  I was hoping she was much sexier 
[01:08:00]  It's amazing what shallow idiots we are  Like, she's so good  Her voice is great  I'm the same way  I saw what she looked like  And I lost something  They bought me out  Why would I care if she's a big fatso?  Because she has an amazing  That's just sexy fucking singing voice  Pavarotti had a great voice  He was a big fat pig  But they were supposed to be  Bring his own toilet  Those opera people  Supposed to be big and fat  Dude, he brought his own toilet  I know  I know  That fat pig  How crazy  Had to be fucking forklifted onto the stage  What a slob  What, fatso? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, he had to bring his own turlet bowl  What, they had to screw his toilet in at every hotel?  Dude, what a fat  I mean, he was royalty  But what a fat pig  Or maybe they didn't use the plumbing  And he just fucking  Put his toilet over it  Like a portable toilet?  Yeah, maybe they just had water in  And he would let his duties fly  And someone's job was to clean out the  Pavarotti's dumps  Wow  That would be amazing  Let's go back to the search thing  You know he didn't wipe good either  Oh, no  I bet he had a bidet in his toilet  Because there's no way he could wipe  His big fat asshole

Because it was so bad  That's what people are like...  This is so bad  It was like the dumb Barbie song  How many videos of that was in your life?  Rebecca Black's Friday has 11.4 million  It's got more than that on other things  Oh, yeah  Yeah, and then they dubbed it and stuff 
[01:12:00]  Someone explain the kayak thing?  They keep showing the video  I'm behind on this one  I know it was 90, 95 feet  Did the guy survive?  And why did he do it?  Anyone know?

There's a camera on him  He's just...  I bet you that was a GoPro camera  I would be so scared  But you can't see  Because the giant fucking chiron is in the bottom  That's crazy  That is crazy  And then he just swims up 
[01:12:30]  All right, he survived  90 feet  Why did the paddle go flying?  I don't know  What do we know?  Oh, wait, he's on right now  Shh  Right now  Yeah, probably  I can't see twice, right?

You don't  You just hope for the best prey  I'll smoke you on, guys  I'm just saying what's happening on the country 
[01:13:00]  We've got a few hot spots  To kind of be mindful of  If you are traveling  Especially in the Northeast  Alexander Steele  You know, we've been dealing with this lumbering front  Here it is, extending all  Lumber?  What's that have to do with weather?  Why are they still doing weather on TV?  Is it right on your phone every day?  I just pull down the little menu  That's what I did this morning  I'm like, it's windy out  Right  And I pull down the little thing  And it's like, oh, it's going to be pretty warm, though  Until later on  All right, that's all I need  What happened?  Jim has a habit 
[01:13:30]  I keep notes while the show's on  And Jim has a habit of trying to ruin them  And just now he pointed to the window  So I turned away  And instead of just writing on it  I'm like, usually spilled coffee on my notes  There's no reason for it  Sorry  Yeah, it is  Gotta keep track of what's going on  Friday  That new-ish from Rebecca Black  What is this?  Yeah, I want to hear some new Rebecca Black  Since she was the number one search to name on Google  It's called Person of Interest

[01:16:00]  A person of interest  It's all our friends  They're all white  I love this video  More braces than a pulling award  Oh, she played miniature golf  Like Jake and Vicky on their day  It's a racing forward walk  Oh, she's at the forward salving  Oh, my hook 
[01:16:30]  You missed the breakdown  Oh, you want this?  I want to hear it  I'm sorry  I'm going to put it back to the beginning of the breakdown  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Can you put it to the beginning of the song?  No, not to the beginning of the song  No, just to the breakdown  Why?  Because I'll get too addicted to it  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, this is good  But it's got me so frustrated  And then it's going to go right back into the heavy part 
[01:17:00]  You should be mine  There's a crime scene on the dance floor  I love that  That's funny  Goddamn rich cunts  This is not right  I kill rich cunts  Holiest tape on the front door  Goddamn rich cunts  You are  A person of interest  Yeah  A person of interest  And cushion  Everyone  Even the people in the video are ashamed  They can't dance  They're embarrassed for it 
[01:17:30]  They can't even cheer  Look at them  They're trying to root  Yes, we are  Who is the fucking fruity guy?  I'd say smash  I'd say this is smash  The cop is drawing a caricature of her  Yeah, yeah  What a Bieber ripoff this kid is  I have a total Bieber ripoff  Wow  It's kind of catchy  That's kind of catchy  I like that song  Are they playing it on that dumb channel?  What channel would they play that on? 
[01:18:00]  Hits 1  Hits 1 gave Friday a couple plays on Fridays  But no  But this is new  We have not embraced Rebecca Black  Why wouldn't Hits 1 play Friday a lot?  They take themselves very seriously  Oh god  That's just dumb  So where is this playing?  Comedy?  Comedy, yeah  Raw dog  Raw dog  Do you want to hear our other song that you guys don't know about?  What is that one?  Word  My moment  Oh  No, we're done with this, aren't we?  No, my moment, Ope  It's a good one  We don't have to track through the whole thing 
[01:18:30]  30 million viewers can't be wrong  Wow  Well  This is an advertisement  Oh god  I thought she was in bed with a much older man  I was about to like this video  She was a 40 year old  Oh wow  Almost 600,000 dislikes on this  Wow  She is disliked  Why do they hate her so much?  Yeah, because she's not  Is she just not great?  She's making a mockery of seeing  Yeah  She doesn't mean to me  No, she's  She's just doing the best she can  She's got like professional videos  Aren't you the one who said  That I would be nothing 
[01:19:00]  Wow  Well, I'm about to prove you wrong  Oh, this is like a hey  Chicken right  This is getting back at everybody that doubted her  My whole wish it's about to come true  And she put the number one up with her finger  Yes  It's the one she diddles herself with  I'll just keep on dreaming  She's nine  Nah, she's definitely masturbating  This is my moment  Oh, Friday, Friday 
[01:19:30]  Why?  She's um  The problem with her is  Here's why people don't like her  Because it's her sociopathic  Lack of understanding how terrible she is  Yeah, yeah  She really thinks she's great  I felt very bad for her when I met her  Oh, why?  Because she's young  And if she was 18, I'd kill her  But she's fucking 13  It's like  She's only 13  Or 14  She's really young  But she got all that exposure  And fame  Out of nowhere  Just to be so disliked 
[01:20:00]  It was like she's a nice girl  She was very sweet  For the love of God  Please stop playing this shit  Watch her dance  Here's the Tonight Show dance  Oh, she's trying to dance  Oh  I wonder why she's not touring  She's lip syncing  You think she is?  Yes  She was lip syncing there  Oh, look at her dance  Look at her dance  Wow  Nobody's enjoying that  She's doing the pee-pee dance  This is why I felt bad for her  Because she's so young  You feel like you're watching 
[01:20:30]  The one person who doesn't get the joke  Or the one person who doesn't get it is her  Oh, no  And honestly, they didn't have her on to mock her  I don't think Jay knew who the fuck she was  They wouldn't mock her third  But it's  Yeah, she was just a huge pop culture phenomenon  So Jay Leno had her on  As crazy as that is, I feel bad for her  She's not ready for the attention she's getting  Yeah  Is what the problem is  I would rather see an 18-year-old being humiliated like that  Right  Or a 20-year-old  Who's more  Right  Who could be more aware  Like, you know, at that age, you don't  Don in Texas is going to teach us about that dumb kayak guy 
[01:21:00]  Oh, hi, Don  The kayak  What happened with the kayak?  I hate to interrupt all the fun and everything  But, um  No, the, uh, the guy  He teaches people how to go over waterfalls  That waterfall right there is in Alabama  And the reason that he, uh, he throws the, um, uh, the paddle  Is so that when he hits the water at the bottom  He doesn't crush his ribs or impale himself on it  Makes sense  Oh, fuck  So that's important when you're going over the  When you're going over a waterfall in a kayak  Yeah, yeah 
[01:21:30]  Make sure you throw the paddle  Get rid of that paddle  But do you get it back?  What do you lose it?  I think on that one right there  When I was watching it  It was on one of them stupid news channels  But he, uh, he lost his paddle  But basically what he's teaching people is  You throw your paddle  You grab hold of the, uh, uh, the kayak  And like, you know, like  What is that?  The scissor dive?  I think Anthony knows all about that  But anyway  Why would Ann know about the scissor dive?  I guess he's Professor Anthony 
[01:22:00]  Oh, okay  Alright, you know what?  You're right  You're right  No, I didn't know  I take it back  You're right  I'm just a truck driver  I just listen to the news all day  That's all  That does look fun, though, right?  Going over the edge  Oh, my God  It's such a stupid thing to do  What's the difference between that  And sitting in that stupid devil's fucking armchair?  Well, it's actually going over  Well, how do you get out of the, uh, the tumble  As they call it at the bottom there?  Well, I guess because of the buoyancy of the kayak  It eventually just pushes you out of it 
[01:22:30]  Oh, look at the smart trucker  Yeah  One in a thousand, huh?  Yeah, it just pushes you out of the washing machine  Down there at the bottom  Alright  I would do that with a parachute  Like you over the edge and parachute down  Why?  I don't think that'd be good  And you also gotta know where  Parachute would get wet  You also gotta know where the pool is at the bottom  And not hit any of those damn rocks  Oh, that's true  Better be deep  It should be deep  Because of all the water, right?  Yeah  Partying, partying  Yeah  Yep  Alright, guys, I'm bunching out 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, you do that  We'll see you soon  Would you ever think of going over the falls in a kayak?  That's just insane  No  Look at this video  What the fuck?  Get the fuck out of here  Why would you do that?  He just goes right over the edge  That's so stupid?  Holy shit  And there he goes  He just disappears in the water  Halfway down  I did that  Halfway down  Now you didn't chip  Yeah, I did  I'm a white water guy  I'm a big adventurer  Just shoot right over the edge  Boom  Yeah  Fuck yeah  Who disliked this video  Who's the asshole that has the video? 
[01:23:30]  Oh my god, there's 16 dislikes  Really?  Larry Niagara  That guy doing that though  Honestly, he pretty much was committing suicide  Like, how does he know he's not dying?  Uh, that's a good question  Like, you gotta be prepared to go  Alright, I'm gonna do this  And if I make it, it's cool  But, you know, I'll probably die  He's doing like some evil Knievel shit, I'm sure  Trying to figure it out best he can 
[01:24:00]  Let's knock down his odds  Like, obviously throw the paddle  Throwing that paddle, that makes up for a  Well, think about it, man  If you had the paddle like this  The force, you're gonna fucking  Take your head off  Either take your head off  Or fucking break all your ribs  Or knock you out  So now you can't figure out  How to get back up to the surface, right?  That's crazy  Everybody's acting like this guy  Some sort of hero  But he's just a big zero  Don't try it at home, kids  Alright, let's take a break 
[01:24:30]  Oh, okay  Everybody's acting like this guy  Who do we got coming in today?  Natasha?  Yeah, Leggero  Leggero?  Leggero?  Yeah, she's funny  She's playing the Carolines, right?  Is she?  Yes  Okay  I've done Chelsea lately with her  She's always on  Oh  She's a following  She's eight?  Yeah, yeah, she's funny  Alright, good  She'll be in here soon  And now we do the  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Might have a phone topic  We haven't had one in a while  Oh, oh, oh, what happened?  We were doing the top Google searches  Yeah  And  Hold on 
[01:25:00]  Give me a moment, please  A lot of feedback just came in  What the fuck?  You guys are listening to this shit?  They love you  I can't even give the guy credit  Because I don't know where your feedback went  But basically he asked if we could do  E-Rock's top Google searches of the year  Oh, I know  No, because it's probably going to be embarrassed in town  Yeah, yeah, that would be  E-Rock, are you up for the E-Rock top searches of the year segment?  Oh, E-Rock 
[01:25:30]  I like that you're at least asking me  Before you go ahead and do it  Oh, we'll do it anyway  Well, yeah, as long as they, you know, get creative with their searches  Like, you can't just say he Google images pies all day  No  That's just mean  Oh, and the other thing  Are we all in for coffee cake today?  Enemann's?  Original?  Why would you ask that?  Because I saw an Enemann's truck on the way in  And I've been obsessing about it for the last two and a half hours  I would probably have a sliver  Oh, yeah  Have some  You in it?

[01:30:00]  No, he said Xingqiu.  Xingqiu?  Xingqiu.  What's Xingqiu Chang, then?  I think that's Klingon for Beam Me Up.  Remember, Kirk used it once.  A little credit to Northwood Johnny on Twitter,  turning us on to the Chinese version of Friday.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, they're calling it Rebecca Yellow.  That's cigars and scotch.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Very good. 
[01:30:30]  Or Lebeca Brack.  It's Kevin from Connecticut.  All the all-stars are in today.  Bravo.  Yeah, all the all-stars are working for us.  Oh, yeah, they're working.  They're still working hard for the opening up in the show.  On this Xingqiu.  Yep.  Xingqiu.  Xingqiu.  We got Natasha outside the studio.  Let's get her in here.  Yes, Natasha Leggero.  Leggero.  Playing Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah, da-da-da.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Natasha. 
[01:31:00]  Hi.  Well, look at your little English writing hat.  Look at it.  That's adorable.  It's Leggero, right?  Yes, darling.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, some guy last night was like yelling at me.  He's like, take off your hat and serve soup.  What the hell?  And I was like, I don't understand what...  I guess it's like a turn-of-the-century reference.  That's nice.  But then he got so upset, I brought him on stage and he left.  But that's not even a good turn-of-the-century reference.  It's so stupid.  Make some soup.  I guess what happened was someone told me people used to take their hats off.  I don't know. 
[01:31:30]  It's terrible.  I don't know.  Yeah, the reference was a little...  Anyway.  It does look like...  Are we on?  Are we on?  Yeah.  A clopping.  Oh, great.  What an entrance.  A normal one.  That's always the way it is with this show.  We just have to bring to the land.  Everybody says it when they walk in, like, is this hat on right now?  We don't want a big, over-the-top hokey entrance, though.  No, I hear you.  We're just kind of hanging.  And it's right before Christmas, too, so we really don't give a fuck.  Yeah, we really want to be out.  We so don't want to be here.  Everybody's acting like they're in jail.  Yeah.  For this last, like, two weeks.  Even in L.A. 
[01:32:00]  Really?  That's how it is, though.  You want to put the year behind you.  Is this mine?  I was going to start drinking it.  I think you just brought that in with you, didn't you?  Yeah.  No, I didn't bring it in, but...  Oh, okay.  It's worse than drinking somebody else's coffee.  As you're about to drink it, you smell their breath on the lid.  You smell their dirty gums.  Yeah.  Despicable.  One thing that usually sets you off to say that it's the wrong drink is the temperature  difference.  You're like, I could just want that a little warmer.  And then you get all skeeved out.  And you know that's some backwash in there.  Ugh.  Well, thanks for having me when everyone wants to leave. 
[01:32:30]  Exactly.  That's the best time.  And I'm glad you were able to drag yourselves to...  Well, it's the best time.  Okay, good.  To be in here.  To the other side of it, we're actually having a good time, because we're just fucking chilling,  man.  I love it.  We don't care.  We don't care.  We don't care.  Because the bosses don't.  So why should we...  No, it's so sad.  We've talked about Rebecca Black for at least 45 minutes today.  And she's like from last year.  Yeah.  And she's last year's news.  Yeah.  Did you know that that Rick Perry video had more dislikes?  Yeah.  Really? 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  The one where he said gays can't get...  Yeah.  Or what's this thing that's happening?  Everyone's like mad about Christmas.  Like, I know there's something in the air when my dad starts sending me his racist email  forwards.  Like, about the holiday tree.  Like, it's just like, it's our Christmas.  What are we talking about?  Why are they saying holiday?  Yeah.  Like, everyone's got their...  Everyone's all uptight about something right now.  Which, when people try to be edgy by saying, I hate when they commercialize...  It's like, what, do you want the religious angle of Christmas?  Yeah, that's suck.  I like the commercial. 
[01:33:30]  That would suck.  It's the only reason we pay attention.  Yeah.  And I think a lot of people think Jesus died on Christmas.  Yeah.  People actually think that.  Like, they're really connecting the two things.  I don't think we know anything about whoever that was.  But to say even on Easter that it's like, oh, that's when he died and came back as  what we call, you know, zombie Jesus.  Yeah.  That, that...  Zombie Jesus.  That's a good name.  He came back from the dead.  We have the only Messiah that, like, yeah, we have the coolest religion.  We do have the coolest, because he was a zombie.  Zombies are very hot right now. 
[01:34:00]  They're very, like...  Rick Perry has 686,870 dislikes.  I fucking love Rick Perry, because he's such a douche.  Wow, that is a good one.  He's a bigot.  You can't say that right now.  You can't...  If you really think that gay people need to change and be straight, you're probably gay.  But that's why I love him, because he's so...  That's why I love him, because he's so ridiculously out of touch with everything.  There's a lot of people like that.  And he's the governor of Texas.  What did he say on this one?  Oh, you haven't heard of this yet?  No.  Well, I haven't seen the ad yet.  Something about Christmas. 
[01:34:30]  It is, yeah?  It's like, I want to be able to celebrate Christmas in the schools.  Without the queers.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  We don't need to play it.  Let's hear this.  I'm going to admit that I'm a Christian.  Oh, boy.  You don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this  country when gays can serve openly in the military, when our kids can't openly celebrate  Christmas or pray in school.  As president, I'll end Obama's war on religion.  I'll fight against the war on religion. 
[01:35:00]  What?  On our religious head.  I jerk off that.  Faith made America strong.  It can make her strong again.  I'm Rick Perry.  It's a bad thing.  I approve this.  Also, he's in the woods.  Yeah, he's in the woods.  With that music.  Texas.  Yeah, with the regal music.  Why should gays serve in the military?  Gays can serve openly in the military.  And what does that have to do with Christmas?  It has nothing to do with Christmas.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But to attack guys that are braver than you, I mean, maybe he was an ex-soldier, but  this guy's willing to go into the military?  I don't care if they suck dick.  Yeah, but they're gay. 
[01:35:30]  We can't have that.  What's his logic there?  Like, what the fuck?  Raise the gay marriage issue.  If you want to try to raise gay issues, you can't fuck with the military guys.  It's stupid.  They allow gays to go and potentially get killed, defending the country or whatever the fuck  they're doing.  To protect some jerk-off's right to stand here in an awful coat in an outdoorsy scene.  Twat.  Well, it's also pandering, because there are a lot of people in the country who don't  think gays should get married.  And I just do not understand.  It's such...  It's bigotry. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, why shouldn't they suffer like the rest of us?  Attaboyant.  I love that bit.  So sad.  Yeah.  Who cares?  You like the gay marriage thing?  Yeah.  Well, no.  I just think that, like, there are people who are born gay.  Yeah.  And if you really think that they need to change and stop being gay, can you ever imagine  wanting to tell someone what to do with their sex life?  Like, who fucking gives a shit?  I would.  I can.  Some girls.  But it's only like, yeah, I think you should be opening those in front of me.  Yeah.  It doesn't relate to me. 
[01:36:30]  No, I have no problem with it.  Exactly.  I think most people are born gay.  But I think a few of them just want to kind of join that scene.  Yeah, maybe.  I think there's some guys that...  But that's the exception to the rule.  I'm sure.  But still, let them do what they want.  I mean, I know some true dyed-in-the-wool gay people.  They're gay.  Oh, you do?  Well, of course.  Fucking with you.  Who does it at this point?  Yeah, I know.  So it's just sad.  Oh, they're just constantly sucking each other's dicks.  It's just...  It never stops. 
[01:37:00]  It's great.  I don't know.  I don't care.  I just let them help me decorate.  It's the live...  And come see my shows.  The live production of Human Centipede all the time.  I don't care.  I love the gays.  They're great.  No, I'm not even joking.  They're clean and artsy.  Good neighbors.  Good neighbors.  You walked out of gay block in Chelsea.  There's fucking...  There's no graffiti, no bunch of plants.  Small dogs, no problems. 
[01:37:30]  Fucking they're great.  Just looks nice, right?  Do you have a big gay audience?  I do.  You got the gays?  You got your own gays?  Yeah, you got your gays.  Chelsea does, right?  She has a big...  It's a big gay crowd.  Yeah, there's a lot of gay people that come out, I guess.  More lesbians or more homosexual gentlemen?  Lesbians, I find, do not have the best sense of humor as a...  Why is that?  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, that's a very broad statement, but if you do have to make broad statements, what  do you find?  I agree.  I mean, that's...  I've never seen anybody that said, oh my God, these lesbians are at the show. 
[01:38:00]  What fun.  I've never heard a comedian say those words.  They're slightly humorless.  I'm not exactly sure.  What comic to the lesbians like, if you had a pinpoint?  Margaret's show.  Ellen.  Margaret's show.  I bet you a lot of them like Lampanelli.  I bet you a lot of them like Joe Rogan.  Rogan.  I'm just kidding.  She's relatable.  Well, hairdo-wise.  I don't know.  I've never seen anybody that attracted a lot of...  Again, Ellen is somebody who's gay and out about it, but I can't think of anybody.  Ellen's just got moms across the board, too. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, she's got every group.  Do you guys have her on?  No, she probably wouldn't do the show.  She's blown us off over the years.  Yeah, we don't get the type of people that are very politically correct.  Oh, right, yeah.  You kind of have to be to really start...  Yeah.  I mean, if you're doing morning or afternoon talk shows on network television.  Yeah, try to be edgy at fucking 10 a.m.  You know?  True.  You're at Caroline's.  I'm at Caroline's. 
[01:39:00]  Love Caroline's.  It's fun.  They're great over there.  There was a few too many Swiss people in the audience last night.  Swiss people?  It is weird, because it's in Times Square.  It's weird, too many people.  You start doing crowd work, and you're like, oh, wait, you don't speak English.  You don't speak English.  A lot of tourists.  Yeah.  So then you've got to wonder why they're even there, then, if they don't speak English.  They just see a club, and they want to go in.  Caroline's.  Someone hands them a flyer.  Like, they're just kind of...  There's a lot of tourists here who are just, like, wandering around.  Right.  Looking for anything to do.  Anything.  I mean, I've been there.  You know, it's like when you first come to New York. 
[01:39:30]  You get on that dumb bus, that double-decker bus.  Yeah.  I mean, I never did that, but...  Oh, I hope not.  That's terrible.  I fucking...  I want a suicide bomber on one of those so fucking bad.  But getting stuck behind those in the village when I'm going down Fifth Avenue, they're  the worst vehicles in the city.  Yeah.  Those stupid fucking double-decker tourist buses.  Trying to make everything interesting.  It's awful.  It's a hot dog cart.  I always want to go to the TGIF here.  Like, who...  Like, can you imagine coming to New York and, like, go...  Oh, it's half-fried.  I know. 
[01:40:00]  I think it would be the best people.  I might even go there today.  We've talked about this a million times.  Like, when you come to New York and hang out with other people that aren't from New York  and Times Square and go to TGIF, why bother?  Because it's like the flagship TGIF.  Yeah.  It's the New York City one.  It's like the fancy one.  I bet they sell shirts in there.  New York City, TGIFs.  Yeah.  Totally.  We hate Times Square.  I like Caroline's a lot.  We were always there, but fucking Times Square.  I'm staying downtown.  I can't deal with it anymore.  There's nothing to eat.  So you...  Yeah.  I'm just saying... 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Did they put you in a hotel, or are you going to...  I mean, I pick my own hotel.  Okay.  Ooh.  But you don't stay with friends?  No.  Is it tough being a comic on the road, being a female?  It is interesting.  Like, you know.  Don't you get yourself in some weird situations?  Guys hitting on you, and you have no one around to help you out.  I mean, girl comedians aren't, like, fucking the waitresses.  Like, we don't have that.  Believe me, neither are the guys.  The guys are really getting it.  They're all.  I wish.  Did you guys hear Christopher Hitchens died?  Yeah.  Did he really?  The man who famously said women aren't funny. 
[01:41:00]  Yep.  He's done.  Yep.  Well, Jerry Lewis said that.  I didn't know Hitchens said it.  No, Hitchens had the famous article in Vanity Fair.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  That's where...  Vanity Fair.  That's where Bonnie got the whole idea for a movie, from that one article.  From Hitchens?  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he just died last night.  Yeah, he just died last night.  62, esophage...  Esophageal cancer.  He's a smart guy.  Penn loves him.  Esophageal cancer.  He was smart, but he said some pretty stupid things.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just sad.  Jerry Lewis, I never heard Hitchens say that, but Lewis, to me, was more of a story, because 
[01:41:30]  he's a comic, and he said that women aren't funny.  Is he really a comic?  But yeah, I mean, you know what I mean, but he's like old school.  It's like, I thought he was very overrated.  Right.  Really?  Now, that is an edgy statement.  Exactly.  Did he ever make you laugh, like, during the telethon or something?  No.  He was great in The King of Comedy.  Like, I loved him in that.  That was great.  But he was a serious guy in that.  I think that's who he really was.  I never liked him as a comic.  No.  Or a funny, quote, funny guy.  I mean, the truth is, people aren't funny. 
[01:42:00]  It's hard to be funny.  So it's like, you know, it just is a question of stage time, and it's a skill set.  So men have been able to develop that more than women throughout the years.  Why, because what were women doing?  Rattling their pots and pans?  Fucking hanging out.  Yeah.  Having some fun.  Some guy would give our dad some land, and we could just relax.  Yeah.  Good old days.  Some cows.  We didn't have to do anything.  That is true.  Yeah.  We're just starting to have to, like, you know, make as much money as men.  But that's how we got fucked in the whole divorce thing, because women were completely, 
[01:42:30]  they had no clue how to take care of themselves.  And in the oldie days, that's where it started, anyway.  If a guy wanted to get divorced, the woman's just like, oh, my God, I got the vapors.  I don't know how to.  Yeah.  And there was couches made just for fainting.  Yes.  Fainting couch.  Yes.  That's all she'd have to do.  The most work she had to do was just walk over the couch and pass out.  That was like.  Yeah.  And I think they did that when they didn't want to have sex, too.  Yeah.  He married some gross guy for his money. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  So it's better now.  So then what happened?  Talking about me?  What happened with the divorce thing?  Finish your thing.  Well, then you had to pay the woman all kinds of money and support her, because she couldn't  take care of herself.  It kind of made sense.  That is weird.  And now things have changed so much, because now the women can take care of themselves and  work and earn money, and they still rape us in a divorce.  So a woman can get.  Are you divorced?  Yeah.  Okay.  So a woman.  But at least you had a fair settlement.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was ugly.  I did radio for years. 
[01:43:30]  She did nothing and got a shitload of money.  No.  Still?  His divorce settlement, I don't know what he wants to say, lasted longer than his marriage.  Well, that's hilarious.  The men should get together right now and, like, ban against that.  Yeah, well, that doesn't work.  They're never going to change anyone.  Alec Baldwin's making a big stink, because I think he got really fucked by Kim Basinger,  who obviously has her own money.  I understand being fair, but Hank got fucked.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Don't bring it up. 
[01:44:00]  What are you going to say?  No, I don't.  And he had no kids or no house.  No house, no kids.  They were renting a house.  Yeah.  And she doesn't drive.  No house, no kids, no nothing.  And she got...  Just because she's a woman.  That shouldn't...  Yes.  But that shouldn't happen anymore.  I know, but it does.  I'm sorry.  You know what it is with women in comedy, too?  It wasn't you.  Women are taught kind of like...  The stuff that guys are taught is funny, like all this crazy shit we do, like acting  like assholes in school.  It's like those are considered to be masculine qualities.  So if women do it, they're not taught that they're supposed to do it. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  But funny chicks are very sexy and very, like, cool.  I'm not saying they shouldn't do it.  I'm saying it's considered a masculine quality, like, to fucking act like an asshole  in front of the teacher and embarrass yourself.  It's like...  Pull your dick out.  Yeah.  Well, that's when you're the teacher.  I am.  Right to pedophilia.  Where the hell is that coffee cake?  Right there.  Oh, good.  So does it get weird on the road?  That was your question.  Sorry.  Before I went into the death of Christopher Hitchens. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's a dumb question if it is.  The interrogation continues.  It just gets bored.  You get bored?  It just gets boring, I think.  Was it exciting at some point in your career?  I like to go to cities that have museums of modern art.  Oh, look at you.  I mean, you know, like, I don't want to go to Albany.  Yeah.  I'm actually headed there after the show.  Oh.  Are you not?  The closest you have Queensbury, even worse than Albany.  It's like, Albany's the big city.  Have you ever been in a shitty museum?  Thinking, oh, because that's all I have.  You're like, fuck, man.  I mean...  Watercolors.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Bob Ross paintings.  That would be...  They should have that.  But it's all the same.  It's like, all right, it's the mountains in the background, the little meadow, and the giant  tree in the middle of the thing that looked like he ruined it when he was making it.  But he painted that shit effortlessly.  I know.  How the fuck did he do that?  You just don't want to be stuck in some, like, you know, what is it, the Hilton Garden  Inn, or the Courtyard Marriott.  Yeah.  Nothing good's happening in the Courtyard.  No, I like a good real hotel with, like, a bar that's open until four in the morning, 
[01:46:00]  and room service.  Sometimes there's, yeah, there's just no, it's like microwave food, you're in, like, an intersection,  you can't even cross the street to get to a Starbucks.  It's like you're kind of just stuck in this, like, business, it's just terrible.  Yeah, business park.  Yeah, that was great.  There's a plastic manufacturing plant next to me.  Yeah.  But you can't do the same stuff after a show.  This guy, like, you know, guy's trying to fuck, that's what I'm saying, it's harder,  like, I think a lot of men are threatened by a funny woman.  Oh, my God.  It's, yeah, it's hard to figure out, because I've been thinking about this, because, like, 
[01:46:30]  Christopher Hitchens dying, and his whole argument was that the reason why women aren't  funny is because they're not, like, he's like, men, they want to have sex with women,  so that's why they're funny.  But women's motives, women are funny, but their motives are not to fuck.  That's not why, that's why men do everything.  Oh, so the motivation of humor.  That's why Picasso painted.  True.  So, like, then it's like, I'd start wondering, like, why am I doing comedy?  It's not, it's not to have sex with the audience, the hot audience members.  It's a different reason that men and women have to be funny. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, fucking kill tonight.  I wonder how many of these audience balls I can fit in my mouth.  Can you imagine, like, if a woman, like, it's not the same thing.  The motives are different.  But how can Hitchin say that, like, you're going to tell me any guy you know is funnier  than Carol Burnett?  Stop.  It's like, that's just a stupid fucking thing to say.  Yeah.  It's a dumb thing to say.  Well, he's trying to get popular, too.  Like, it's scintillating, you know, to, is this Fox News on who? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's good.  Oh, well, no, actually, this is, I think.  Michelle Bachman spars with About I Rant.  Look at her.  She has so much makeup on.  Wow.  There's something about her, though, man.  You like her?  Not politically, no.  You're hot for Michelle Bachman.  Yeah, I don't know why.  She's cuter than Sarah Palin, I suppose.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I do.  Oh, no, I'd fuck Sarah first.  I gotta say something right here.  I don't like either of them.  Sarah Palin would be better in bed, probably.  I gotta say something right here, right now.  You just saw that picture of Bachman eating that hot dog.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that big corn dog she's just shoving down her throat.  Sam fucking failed me today.  Again?  What?  She was on the Joe Schmo show, one of my favorite shows of all fucking time.  Who?  Weren't you?  I was, yeah.  Rita!  Oh, I thought you were talking about Michelle Bachman.  Oh, fuck Michelle Bachman.  I started fucking shaking over here.  I'm like, how did I not know this?  Oh, shit, I didn't know that.  Oh, that was a very good show.  I mean, it was so funny.  That was hilarious.  Chris Tasha was on that show, too.  She was on the season before me. 
[01:48:30]  Wait, you were on the second season?  No, you were on the first.  I was on the second season.  Were you on the first season?  Why?  Okay.  Oh, you only left the first season?  That's why.  I could count back down.  Why?  The second season was good, but it wasn't, it wasn't, the first season was, you know.  Yeah, the joke was blown by the second season.  No, they found this guy.  It's basically a fake reality show, but it was a long time.  It was kind of ahead of its time.  I think it was.  And, um, but one of the girls just figured it out, so then they let her join the cast.  Right.  She was just like, this is not real. 
[01:49:00]  And, like, she was totally on to me, because I played this drunk girl, and I'm supposed  to get drunk in the pool.  But it was like, when they're filming something, it happened too fast.  Yeah.  Like, they're like, okay, now you've got to get wasted.  I'm like, it's only been 45 minutes since we got here.  Yeah, you've got to get wasted.  So I'm like, okay, I'm trying to be method.  I'm like, am I on pills too?  Like, maybe that's why I'm so wasted.  I can't remember seeing that.  I watched the second season.  I remember the drunk girl.  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  The Joe Schmo show.  And then, and I remember the girl who we were playing the joke on, she was very smart.  Like, her, her, I don't know why they picked her.  Her, her, like, um, hero was Madeline Albright. 
[01:49:30]  I'm like, no one even knows who that is.  So she's going to figure shit out if she knows who Madeline Albright is.  Oh, and this guy who was playing Austin, this, like, handsome actor dude.  He was like, you'd, like, yell at the name Austin, like he would never know his character's name.  You'd be like, Austin, Austin, John.  And then he'd, like, turn his head, like, just, yeah.  But she, look how, she was so skeptical the whole thing.  And then I was like, I just wanted to get away from her because I didn't want to ruin the whole joke.  So I was like, I'm going in to read, into my room. 
[01:50:00]  She's like, oh, what are you reading, Rita?  And I'm like, uh.  And I was like, I don't know, I haven't thought of that.  Like, I didn't know what that, you know, what would a drunk girl be reading.  Like, she was just, like, on to me.  They fucked it up, man.  They couldn't, you know, find another dummy, like, the first episode.  Matt Kennedy Gold was the biggest dummy that's ever been on TV.  What's in the back?  I never saw the show.  It's where everyone's in on the joke except one person.  And it's pretty much they're doing, like, you know, Real World or Big Brother or whatever.  Yeah, a bunch of people in a house kind of a thing.  Jim's not impressed.  No, it reminds me, it's like Goldthwait's movie. 
[01:50:30]  What was the movie he made about with the comedian?  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  The guy thought they were doing a reality show, but it was all about spoofing him.  Wasn't that one, uh, the movie?  Where he thought he was going to be a star in the movie?  Yeah, I didn't see it.  I've heard of this show.  Oh, like Windy City Heat?  That might have been it, actually.  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  It was sort of the same concept.  That was great.  But everyone's in on the joke except one dummy.  Where are you in this?  In the first season, they totally pulled it off.  Second season, which, uh, Natasha was in, they didn't pull it off because the girl was on to them real early.  Yeah.  So they picked the wrong person.  So they made the wrong decision picking a smart, susceptible. 
[01:51:00]  But how did they get out of it?  They found another guy?  There was two people.  Oh, okay.  So then everyone turned against this one guy.  Okay.  You know what?  I'm going to watch this second season.  The one guy was a dope, to be fair.  Yeah, it was a...  I got the DVDs if you want to borrow them.  Oh!  I'm glad you liked that, though.  Abso-fucking-lowly, man.  Oh, look.  All right.  Where are you?  You guys, I was only in one episode.  And my dad, of course, who lives in Illinois, he's like, he still thought it was real.  And he's like, why'd they get rid of you?  I'm like, oh, there I am. 
[01:51:30]  I'm like, Dad, it's a...  There's Rita the drunk.  I was like, Dad.  Hi, I'm Rita.  It's a fake reality show.  I still don't know.  Where are you from?  I'm from Chicago.  I love talking.  Periodically, we're told to hush and we're not speaking.  And every one of us listens except Ingrid.  Oh.  These shows are...  Yeah, right on.  All right.  I mean, you've done a lot with your career.  I'm just saying, that's a little...  That was my first job.  We found a little nugget.  I like this shit.  Thank you.  So how did you get that?  That's a real non-comedian question to ask a comedian. 
[01:52:00]  But did they just audition you or did you just come in for an interview?  Oh, I had to audition for that.  Oh, you had to act for that.  I probably had to go to like nine auditions to get that.  Did they tell you exactly what it was?  I think it paid $375.  Righteous fuck, son.  Yeah.  And you know what?  You were great on Last Comic Standing, man.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, it was fun.  We were friends with Gerard.  Yeah, he was...  It was so great being able to work with him.  He was very...  He's so funny.  He's so smart.  And he was like the most...  What's the word?  Like, judicious?  Like, he was just very fair. 
[01:52:30]  Like, I would just be like, nope.  And he's like, no, no, I need to hear a little more.  I really...  Oh, you judged?  Yeah.  How do I know nothing about other comedians?  I really don't.  I know nothing.  This is your business.  Because you're a self-centered slob.  I never watched anything comedy.  It was Andy Kindler, me, and Grant Gerardo.  Oh, okay.  They were the judges on Last Comic Standing.  Okay.  Not a lot of people watched it.  No, no, no.  I just...  You know how it is.  As a comic, you can't watch...  No, she was a judge.  She did well.  As a comic, you definitely cannot watch Last Comic Standing.  I did two episodes of season two.  Oh, you did.  I remember.  Didn't you have to leave? 
[01:53:00]  I had an MTV contract that...  It was a spring break, so it was time...  There was no way to move the time.  It was a pilot.  I was shooting a spring break.  And if I got in the house, there would have been a direct conflict with the time.  So Peter Engel was like, you know, I would have had to breach  a Viacom concert.  But I remember seeing you on there, and they always try to go for the sentimental.  So I remember there was, like, sad music playing, and you were packing your bags.  Like, I remember you were in a hotel with a suitcase, like, folding your things,  and it's got that sentimental music.  Yeah, go, let's make something of it.  Yep.  Get the music going.  Peter Engel was...  They were nice to me about it, and that actually got me into the Tonight Show. 
[01:53:30]  I didn't want to...  My manager...  I wanted to do season two.  I was like, I want to get in that house.  And my manager's like, don't do it, don't do it.  It's a reality show.  Don't do it.  And he told me, don't do it.  But I'm glad I did.  The house, that would have been fun.  There was no house.  Wasn't there back then?  There was, yeah.  But they changed it all up for the season she was on.  Oh, they did?  Okay, yeah.  There was no house at all.  The house would have been interesting.  Yeah, I thought the house thing was a nice little angle, right?  Yeah.  That was when Voss did it.  They had a house.  Our good friend, Rich Voss.  He was just so obnoxious.  I was with him last night.  He is so funny.  Yeah.  He was...  He had a...  Rich Voss? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Wait, the Rich Voss?  He did...  Well, he came to Caroline's and did a little...  He popped in for six minutes.  Oh!  We were making fun of him.  Look at him.  We were making fun of him because he did six minutes, but he was sitting down on the stool.  Oh, no.  What is he?  Let me bruise.  What a fucking pompous ass.  So funny.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Did he just want to stop it and do a guest set?  Is that what he did?  I think he was just there hanging out.  Are you friends with him?  He and Bonnie came to...  And you know Bonnie?  Yes.  Okay.  Did you do their movie?  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Which I think is going to be coming out soon-ish.  Yeah.  I think they're done editing.  I saw it.  Yeah, I saw it.  I liked it.  I'm excited to hear their podcast, though.  Oh, that thing is insane.  Which is just them yelling at each other.  Them fucking yelling.  It's hilarious.  We did.  I went out to dinner with them, and it was so hilarious, and it's just them yelling at  each other.  Yeah.  And so now they've got a podcast.  We did about two hours on their podcast the other day.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Have you heard it?  It's great.  I have not heard it.  Because they yell and scream at each other, and it's stuff that we would even think twice 
[01:55:00]  about airing.  Like, holy fuck.  Maybe we shouldn't air that.  But they don't give a fuck.  Let's air it.  Who's doing that?  I mean, it's...  There's so many people.  They're just arguing about, you know, he's accusing her of fucking people.  Yeah.  It's so uncomfortable.  Last night, she's like, we've never gone on a vacation where I haven't had to perform.  And he's like, what about our honeymoon?  She's like, I still had to do radio.  That's rich.  She's got to do radio on their honeymoon.  They're an amazing couple.  They are.  They're a great couple.  When she first came in, she had some diamonds on that he gave her, like at some comedy club 
[01:55:30]  and, you know, some place we would hang out in L.A.  I'm like, that's your husband?  That's who you're going to marry?  I got a good deal on the diamonds.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  He's great at bartering.  Hey, man, we laugh at him, but he barters his ass off.  But he's shameless.  Yeah, he really is.  You know what I mean?  Like, listen, on September 12, 2001, he was out trying to buy jewelry.  Fucking creep.  I'm sorry about your loss, but if you don't need that ring anymore.  How about the people who were getting trampled in Black Friday stampedes? 
[01:56:00]  Like, there was like $2 waffle makers, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  And like, people were getting injured.  Yeah, they wanted those waffle makers.  I don't know who would even go out to those things.  Like, I don't like going shopping when the mall is empty.  It's a pain in the ass.  Also, you can order everything online, and they just throw it over your fence.  And you don't have to go outside.  It's great now.  It's the future.  This is what we all were waiting for.  This and flying cars. 
[01:56:30]  Flying cars?  Is that going to happen?  But we got this.  We kind of want the flying cars.  We actually got it.  Actually, I'm more happy about being able to shop from home than fucking flying cars.  Really?  I would like to wear a Mylar suit, though, all the time.  What about jetpack?  Would you go jetpack if you could?  Nah, it's dangerous.  They don't have that shit figured out.  Flying cars, believe me, people can't drive in two dimensions.  Fucking every drive, every ride home is a nightmare.  And I swear, the racial epithets that fly out of my mouth with the windows rolled up.  Do you drive in Manhattan? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I drive in, and I drive back home to the tiny hamlet out on Long Island that I live.  And it's just a nightmare, though, driving.  Through Queens, it's all Asian people.  And I will say, Asians, it's the stereotype, but they are the worst drivers.  It's either they're weaving all over or doing 30 miles an hour on the expressway.  And I look.  I go like, oh, well, there we go.  Oh, there's, oh.  What about when you're in the cabs? 
[01:57:30]  Like, who are the cab drivers constantly talking to on the phone?  Like, it's, like, more than, like, an 18-year-old girl.  Like, when I was in high school, like, it kind of reminds me of that, but they're, like, these, like, 60-year-old.  Yeah, there's a lot of plans.  Do you want the real answer?  Yeah.  They're talking to their families back home.  Are they?  Oh, because they have, like, good plans, like, good calling plans?  They must.  A lot of these guys leave their...  Constantly on the phone.  They leave their families to come here to drive a cab, and then what they do is that's  how they, you know, keep in touch with their family.  They just talk to them the whole time while they're doing the cab. 
[01:58:00]  I'd like to scream at the person they're talking to.  Do you know you're talking to a cabbie?  Because I've asked.  Absolute fucking zilch.  Because I've asked.  I've asked many times, like, who the fuck are you talking to?  Oh, my wife back home or whatever.  You think it's the wife?  I don't know.  It kind of seems like they're, like, it feels like they're talking to other men.  Another guy.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  That's the vibe I get.  I don't like it because it makes me feel stupid because out of nowhere they'll be, like,  and I'll go, excuse me?  Like, they're talking to me?  And then they don't even acknowledge you.  They just keep, and then you realize they're on the phone. 
[01:58:30]  You're like, oh, now, thanks for making me feel uncomfortable in your cab.  It's a weird way to spend, like, 45 minutes.  Like, in the back of a car while someone's just screaming at somebody else in another language.  Better that than them talking to you.  I actually answer when I know they're not talking to me just to annoy them.  Like, if someone's like, I don't know, I'll, like, excuse me?  Oh, no, no, no.  I just keep doing it.  It's just a little private vindictiveness.  That's very obnoxious.  Yeah.  Fucking assholes babbling.  Pay attention.  It's having a good conversation.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I guess it's the only thing that keeps them busy is just to yap for hours. 
[01:59:00]  But it's always quiet and hushed, creepy tones.  Yeah, that's when it comes.  Yeah, it is.  It's very conspiratorial.  Yes.  You're wondering if they have some kind of plot together.  Yeah, they're waiting for the fucking dynamite in the trunk.  What is it?  Code word?  You're from L.A., so you're...  No, I'm not from L.A.  No?  You're from California?  No.  You live in California?  I live in California.  That part's right.  I'm sorry.  I'm from Illinois.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Lando Lincoln.  Yes.  That's what they call it.  Yes.  So, now, you went out to California?  Well, I actually came here. 
[01:59:30]  I lived here.  Oh, okay.  New York first.  Went to school here.  Oh.  Although, I have to say...  Juilliard?  I wish.  I auditioned for Juilliard.  You did?  Did not make the cut.  Didn't even get a call back.  Wow.  Are you a good actress?  I like that no one's ever seen anything I've done.  No, but in general, do you?  Because it's hard.  Acting is fucking brutal.  I was a child actress.  Really?  Anything we know?  Not a child star.  Anything we know, though?  No.  Just theater.  A little show called Punky Brewster?  You were Punky Brewster? 
[02:00:00]  My two dads.  Maybe you've heard of that.  I was...  Yeah, so, is acting hard?  It is hard, but I'm saying, are you good at it?  I feel like I like it, if it's the right part.  Were you really in stuff when you were...  Yes, I was a child stage actor.  Oh, so on stage.  Yes.  Were you in any production of Annie?  No, that's a musical.  I was not that...  Oh, well, what were you in?  Okay, wow.  Drama?  You know, like...  Bye Bye Birdie?  Yes.  Oh, that's another musical.  The third grade version of Glendary Glen Ross. 
[02:00:30]  She played a very young Shelly.  I would love to see that.  Guy just cursing.  Little kid just...  Yeah, young eight-year-old Natasha.  You cunt.  You can't work with men.  Actually, on my website, I'll show you guys.  I do have, like, something I did when I was little.  Oh, cool.  Let's get this right now.  I definitely want to see that.  It's going to be hilarious.  But...  I, um...  Toddlers in Tiaras would do that one.  That...  What is happening?  Have you seen Eden Wood?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm obsessed with her.  It's hilarious.  Cutie, cutie, cutie, cutie. 
[02:01:00]  She's singing her song out on Hollywood Boulevard with her mother just giving her shit.  She has a memoir out.  This six-year-old has a memoir out.  Yeah.  It's sold out.  It's called From Cradle to Crown.  Yeah.  And I've been dying to get this.  It's the last one.  My first big break.  That's me.  The other girl's really funny, too, that's on the same episode as her.  The brown-haired girl?  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  They're just great.  Here we go.  Turn it more set.  Here's Natasha's big break as a kid.  Oh, look at you.  You're opening up a lot.  I'm just kidding.  He does not.  Can you hear it?  Okay.  Look at her.  He did not. 
[02:01:30]  Let's see it.  That's just a righty old comb.  He's like a little rascal.  He was probably going to throw it away.  Anyhow, I got something better.  This is the dumbest scene.  Oh, this got cut from the movie.  I should probably add.  Oh, did it?  What movie?  Oh, that's wrong.  Clockwork Orange.  Look, there's Alan Arkin.  Is that him?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You can have it.  My comb's better any day.  There's my eye roll.  Still do that.  Oh, the eye roll? 
[02:02:00]  I remember on this film set, my lunchbox broke, and I yelled, cut.  Oh, shit.  And the director was like, you do not yell.  Cut.  Cut.  So that was.  What was your motivation?  Little bitch?  Yeah, I guess.  You were quite snotty in that scene.  That's, I mean, that's just what happens.  What was the name of the movie?  It was called Personal Foul, and it never really made it, you guys.  But I do remember going to the premiere so excited, and then just like, they never told 
[02:02:30]  me it got cut out.  Oh, no.  And I had my whole family, we had like two rows, and then all of a sudden the credits  rolled, and like my tears just started to roll.  I mean, I was so confused.  It's a tough business, kid.  And it's really just been one heartache after another.  Wow.  I want to do a movie and book kids just to not tell them I'm cutting them.  Get their reaction?  Yeah.  And Alan Arkin, it's funny, Glenn Gary, he was in that.  Well, that was Adam Arkin, his son.  Yeah, that was like the. 
[02:03:00]  Did you say Alan Arkin or Adam?  Which one's the one who's not that famous?  Adam.  That's who that was.  Oh, I didn't know that there wasn't Adam Arkin.  Adam was the guy that was supposed to be George Clooney when ER came out and Chicago  Hope came out at the same time.  And it was like, everybody was confused.  And then, you know, one of them took off.  I won't say who.  You try to figure it out on your own.  One of them really went to other stars.  I just got excited about Adam Arkin.  Because I thought it was Alan Arkin.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's his son. 
[02:03:30]  It's like applauding Eric Douglas.  That's who I am.  No showbiz knowledge.  Adam, he's a big star.  Oh, he's on Sons of Anarchy?  He was, season two.  Hey, guys, he's got a career.  Yeah, Adam Arkin was.  He was a white supremacist.  Oh.  He's a handsome guy.  He looks a little like Clooney, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people saying, is this Natasha?  I'm in love with her.  She's hilarious and adorable.  Yeah, we're not pointing out the adorable.  People go to the website.  That's because I just woke up.  No, you look really good in the morning. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, you know what?  You don't need to be all dolly.  I've got to be honest here.  You've got some natural beauty.  You had your pictures online, and we were looking at them.  If we're going to talk about it, let's talk about it.  To judge.  You're terrific.  We were judging people, and we were looking at the pictures.  You're really cute.  You're like cuter than your internet thing.  What?  Oh, you like this, what I have happening now?  Yeah, I like this right here, as opposed to some of the stuff online.  No lip gloss?  Nah, man.  All right.  Well, thanks.  See, I'm just the opposite.  I like when someone almost looks inhumanly made up.  You like that?  Like you like the Kardashians kind of like? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, like just a cartoon of a whore.  You would like anime.  What's wrong with you?  You would like anime, basically.  Yeah, exactly.  A cartoon of a whore.  That's great.  Getting fucked by tentacles.  It's amazing what the Japanese get off on that.  Sure, yeah.  That's considered sexy.  Oh, people are saying, let's say, you look like a 1986 Susanna Hoffs.  They're giving you that.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Do people see me right now?  No.  Yeah, they don't.  Am I being, is this videotaped? 
[02:05:00]  No.  Okay.  We're only doing upskirts today.  We're not that good.  We should get an under-the-desk fucking, oh, that would be great.  Just for when women are here.  Well, there was a time.  There's Scottish men.  There was a time we debated if we should do that, but now we, uh.  Yeah, that'd be a human resources.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  How often are you on, Chelsea?  I've only done it with you one time.  Oh, I do that show pretty regularly.  I'm actually on her NBC show as well.  Oh, really?  She's got a sitcom coming out in January, which is she plays her sister, and then Laura Prepon 
[02:05:30]  plays Chelsea.  It's very weird.  And Lenny Clark's in it?  Lenny Clark's in it.  Oh, he's the father, I think.  He's Chelsea's dad, and I'm the nemesis who everybody hates.  Oh, that's great.  And so, uh, but it's very weird.  You're going to roll your eyes?  I do a lot of that acting that I learned.  That's just a ratty old comb.  That's just a ratty old comb.  It's like an Ed Wood movie.  I didn't know that much then, you guys.  A woman, like Natasha, would have trouble finding her comb.  It's perfect.  Take it.  That's just a ratty old comb. 
[02:06:00]  And this just came in.  You're turning on my brother-in-law in Philly, too.  Oh, shit.  She sounds so fucking cute.  Damn.  But she's funny, too, man.  Thank you, darling.  What's going on?  It's okay.  But she's also hilarious.  That's Laura Prepon.  She's playing Chelsea.  But it's very weird, because Chelsea's playing her sister, Sloan, and she's wearing a wick.  See, she's wearing a wick.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, okay.  And so it's very meta.  That is an odd thing.  I kind of like the concept, though.  It's different.  It's cool.  It's weird.  Why not?  It's fun.  She knows she can play herself if she wants to.  That's just an interesting idea. 
[02:06:30]  I have to say, though, working...  Have you ever worked on one of these multicam sitcoms where they have an audience?  Well, not really.  Oh, God.  Because you know the difference between...  I might have heard of a show called Seinfeld that I had no part of.  You know the difference between the single cam, multicam?  Yes.  Single cams, you know...  Well, I'm just saying it because maybe people who are listening...  Yes, it's for the listeners.  Us showbiz folk understand a lot of...  But the multicam where they tell you where to laugh, it's so bizarre.  Wait, do you guys want to see one of these?  Wait, what do you mean?  Hold on.  I'll tell you.  This is tough.  It's for you. 
[02:07:00]  It's weird to see.  Is this your first time ever talking to a woman?  No.  What?  From the number one best-selling book by Chelsea Handler and starring Laura Prepon from That  70s Show...  Look at you.  Yeah, all grown up.  ...comes a real mother of a comedy.  I don't think I can do this.  You can do this.  Girls at the prom do this all the time.  We just placed that.  Remember at Chelsea, coming to Wednesdays in January on NBC.  Chelsea's playing her sister.  You know what?  We were talking about... 
[02:07:30]  I did Lucky Lou, which was one season, but all the laughs there were...  Lou was so weird because there was no...  He would not allow laughs to be doctored.  And he wouldn't allow them to be sweetened.  He wouldn't allow them to be...  But he said that every show does that where they have a guy called The Laugh...  Oh, yeah.  I forget the guy who fixes them.  Oh, you guys, this is what I have to tell you.  You don't even understand what's happening.  There's an audience warm-up guy there who is throwing taffy.  Like, all of a sudden, you're in the middle of acting.  They're like, cut.  He's like, okay, who here can...  Who knows the Macarena?  And then people start standing up, doing the chicken dance. 
[02:08:00]  They're throwing pizza.  The warm-up the other day...  He was literally...  I'm not...  This is literally spinning plates on his spinning plates.  And then he balanced a ladder on his chin to keep the audience screaming.  Let's keep them up.  Come on, come on.  They've got to keep their energy up.  Isn't that sort of distracting for you guys?  Yes, it's like acting at a parade.  It is the most bizarre thing.  So it's just like such a...  It's so fun to do it live.  It's just you hope it transfers onto the TV, as they say, when they're waiting in line 
[02:08:30]  on Black Friday.  The TV.  Wait to get a TV.  What was the clip we played where they took the laughs out, and you realize how so...  Oh, that's great.  It's of Big Bang Theory.  You've seen it, right?  Yeah.  And you realize, oh my God, there's nothing funny about this.  It's like a Harold Pinter play or something.  It's just very...  Just nothing.  Not one chuckle.  You don't even know where you would laugh.  And that's one of the hottest shows, if not the hottest show on TV.  Chuck Lorre, man. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  He knows how to do it.  He knows how to put them together, I guess.  But the last scene...  He does Two and a Half Men, too.  Yes.  I know.  Just because of good old Mr. Sheen.  We all know his name now, right?  But the scene without the laughs, you're like, holy fuck.  This is great.  Some sexual intercourse.  I'll take the bullet.  Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.  Yeah, yeah, enough debate.  I'm going to take action.  Excuse me.  Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?  No.  Would you like to be?  Sure, why not? 
[02:09:30]  Sheldon?  Bip, bip, bip.  Can I have your phone number?  Uh, yeah.  Writes it on the hand.  They're in a cafeteria.  There, problem solved.  Dumbass.  Like, there's no punchline.  There's nothing there.  Nothing.  But you can hear in your own stupid head where the laugh track would be. 
[02:10:00]  Where they would sweeten it.  It's all rhythm and not...  Groucho said it.  Laugh track is the death of comedy  because you don't have to be funny to get the reaction.  Yeah.  And why are you telling people where to laugh?  It stinks.  It's so weird.  But I hope people like the show.  And laugh where they're supposed to be.  I don't even want...  When I shot a...  Years ago and the fucking...  Blow it on what?  Yeah.  Myself.  Just thinking of my own wonderfulness.  I was fucking screaming at my manager  because there was an audience coordinator out there  getting reaction shots of laughs. 
[02:10:30]  I'm like, what the fuck is he doing?  I don't want fucking fake audience laugh shots.  And he said it makes editing easier.  Like when they have to cut,  instead of cutting just from you,  I'm like, okay, that makes sense.  But at least just shoot a real laugh.  Never again will I allow that to be done  when they fucking film everybody...  Woo!  If you can't get that as a stand-up,  if you can't get a good laugh,  then you don't deserve to have one of your fucking special.  But another way to look at it  is that it is like stand-up in a way  with this kind of sitcom.  So it's like you do...  In stand-up, you don't want to watch it without a laugh track. 
[02:11:00]  Imagine like you...  Or without laughter.  Like imagine on TV, you've got your special  and people aren't laughing.  But you know what?  That would be weird.  I've noticed that I don't necessarily...  When I'm watching something on TV,  I don't need the audience to laugh.  Like I enjoy when they do.  But if I'm laughing at something  or I'm enjoying a comic,  I don't give a fuck what the audience is doing.  But you're a savvy comedian  and a savvy, you know, audience.  Yeah, maybe it helps.  But I don't think...  I think that it really does wreck it  and it makes it easy 
[02:11:30]  because then people write for cadence and pacing.  And this is all sitcoms.  Duck, duck, duck, laugh, duck, duck, duck.  They don't write to be funny or natural.  With that said,  we've got a friend's scene without the laughter.  I don't see how that's possible.  You want to try this?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Can you turn that a little, Sam,  so we can all watch TV?  Did everything go all right with the moment?  Oh, yeah.  No problems.  It's all taken care of.  Ross, thank you.  Hey, do you guys want to go see a movie?  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  Yeah, Pheebs? 
[02:12:00]  No, thanks.  I've already seen one.  It's not that bad.  I got a sweater.  Okay.  I'll come.  You want to hear something weird?  Always.  I didn't get the anonement.  What?  We're still married.  Don't tell Rachel.  See you later.  It's like the way he's talking.  That's brutal. 
[02:12:30]  It's so uncomfortable.  Do you have that same scene with the laugh track?  Can you find it really fast, possibly?  I got to hear with the laugh track.  You know where they're putting the laughs in,  but it's not funny lines, really.  Here's why you don't need it.  Movies don't do it.  Movies don't have laugh tracks.  The only show I ever saw a laugh track  that did make me nauseous  was there's a British one  with Alan Partridge.  You ever see that?  Where there's a laugh track  in outdoor situations,  but for some reason it works.  Brits love a good laugh track, 
[02:13:00]  those assholes.  But for some reason  that worked on Coogan,  Steve Coogan's show.  I guess the point is  you could use it a little  to enhance maybe,  but now it's become what they do  and it has nothing to do  about it being funny.  They smooth them out.  They balance them.  It's fucking hideous.  They're pandering to the idiots.  Yeah, you're supposed to laugh  right here.  And they want it to sound  like it's just this laugh riot,  this explosion of fun.  That's not the way it is.  But Chelsea is hilarious  and I think that the show will be,  I think people will just want to see it. 
[02:13:30]  She's genuinely funny though.  She really is.  She's funny and she can be very shitty  and that makes me laugh.  That attitude makes me laugh.  Yeah, she's just being herself  and her talk show is so great  because it's the perfect version  of what makes her the funniest.  Just kind of interrogating people  in her own way  and it's a lot of,  you do the show,  a lot of it's off the cuff.  Like she just will say shit.  I'm amazed though,  like I admire the ability  to be that fucking curt  and short with celebrities  because I'm such a fucking worm.  You know, I'm like, 
[02:14:00]  so I want them to like be so bad.  Yeah, I know, really good.  But she'll just like  deadpan somebody  if they say something stupid  and I kind of respect that.  No, it's cool.  I don't have the ability to do that.  Well, we got to take a break.  Our crumb cake has spit on it.  Is that spit?  Do we get cake?  You want a piece of cake?  It's kind of big.  I wouldn't mind.  That's not spit.  Are you saving it?  Well, we were embarrassed  to cut it in front of you, I guess.  That's not spit.  That's the grease.  I didn't spit all over it.  Oh, come on, you guys.  Cut the cake.  Cut the cake.  Oh, please.  We need some cake.  We should take a break though. 
[02:14:30]  Natasha's here.  All right.  From Caroline's all weekend  through Sunday.  I hope this is scintillating enough.  Am I supposed to be like  talking about...  Oh, don't you worry about it.  I thought you guys  were going to ask me about,  you know, ass play.  No, you want us to?  We certainly can go there.  We actually don't ask you about it.  Stick around.  We tell you about it.  It's 212-757-4100.  Caroline's...  Natasha's obviously  a very, very funny comic.  Natasha...  How do you say  the last name here?  Leggero?  Leggero.  L-E-G-G-E-R-O on Twitter.  Natasha Leggero on Twitter.  Okay. 
[02:15:00]  Break.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Serious accident.  Ooh!  What's that?  Fuck you!  What's that?  Fuck you!  Ooh!  Fuck you!  What's that?  Fuck you!  I would never say  Darling!  Darling!  Darling! 
[02:15:30]  Darling!  Darling!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I would never say darling!  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[02:16:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know what? I like this Natasha, man.  We're having a very fun chat there on the break.  Fuck, we just had 20 minutes of good radio there that no one gets to hear, unfortunately. 
[02:16:30]  Now we've got to make something new up.  It's so cool you guys get to say whatever you want.  It is cool.  Oh, yeah.  Well, when you do regular morning radio, it's so annoying.  You can't say anything.  And they'll just beep it out or like, yeah, my Peter.  It's like, what are you talking about?  Boobies!  You can't even say it.  At the NMR run on regular radio, we weren't even allowed to say boobies anymore.  Oh, my God.  They got really bad.  Some of the guys were like, you can't say that. 
[02:17:00]  I got banned from a place in Vegas because I didn't realize it was live.  Good for you.  And so I was doing the Playboy radio.  And I just was like saying whatever I wanted.  Or I was like, how was it like on Chelsea?  I was like, oh, it's so great.  So you can say whatever you want.  Like I could say pussy and they'll beep it.  And the woman's face, it was on TV.  And the woman's face, it was afternoon.  So I was like, oh, this isn't going to be live.  And it was.  But you said it's Playboy radio or Playboy TV.  You would think they would get away with it more.  I was doing a Playboy show.  But I guess they brought me on like a Fox News afternoon show to promote. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, I gotcha.  But anyway, it's great that you guys can say that.  And you know what?  You cut a nice slice of freaking crumb cake.  Oh, boy.  Did we enjoy our crumb cake?  What a bunch of fucking little knitting bee.  We really are.  Fucking old bitties we are.  At one point, it's out of the box.  And Jimmy covers it.  Why did you cover it?  Covered it with a napkin.  I covered it because we were all talking.  You don't want to spit on it.  I've coughed a little bit.  And out of respect for everybody else, I didn't want to get spewed them all over the top of  my fucking crumb cake.  And then we were embarrassed to pull out the crumb cake in front of Natasha. 
[02:18:00]  And all of a sudden, she's like, what is that?  Crumb cake?  Let's get it.  Let's get that going.  As I'm walking out, I hear, I'll cut it.  I'm the woman.  I'm good at entertaining.  Yeah, you really are.  I mean, it's like it's in our DNA to kind of like facilitate everything.  Do you do the family thing being Italian?  Do you do that whole thing for Thanksgiving or Christmas or anything?  I've created my own family.  Oh, you have?  I make them come to me.  I don't like going home to Illinois.  There's really no need. 
[02:18:30]  You don't like to just visit?  Not at all, really.  Not a real banner spot of Illinois?  No.  In the middle of nowhere?  I mean, I just think there's a certain type of people, they don't understand you can live  on a coast.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just kind of stuck in the corn.  It's pretty sad.  When did you know that you had to get the fuck out of there?  Oh, I just remember like being 11 or 12 and I always like mowed lawns and had paper routes.  And I remember working at the grocery store and just looking at a clock and being like, 
[02:19:00]  when is like legally, when can I get the fuck out of here?  And I think I was like 17.  I moved to New York.  I'm getting out of this ratty old state.  Where's my comb in my pack?  I was ready.  Yeah, huh?  You just knew.  So they come to see you for the holidays?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, my mom's coming.  Okay.  Yes.  Your dad is not living or is, I could have just said dead and I tried to make it like  sound like, is your dad dead or do you not get along?  No, but they don't get along.  So, you know. 
[02:19:30]  Do you get along with them?  Sure.  Cool.  I mean, comedians generally, they're parents.  This is great.  Now we know why you're a comedian.  Yeah.  I mean, I think with most stand-ups that they did not get enough love from at least one parent.  Don't you think?  I got too much that I knew I didn't deserve.  Really?  Yes.  Well, you are a weird one.  Well, that's another take on it.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yes.  You haven't lived until you see Jimmy in, let's say, January 15th and her, Jimmy's parents show  up with Christmas gifts.  Yeah.  Then he still has it open.  Because I don't see them in the holidays. 
[02:20:00]  And then Jimmy has to awkwardly open them up backstage at a January 15th show.  Yes.  The fest was last year, I think it was, where they had to run out to the car to get your  gifts.  I know.  Because they weren't even sure if they should even bring them in to the Borgata.  So you make your parents nervous.  I don't mean to.  I don't want to.  You're like a golden child.  I would give away the stuff.  Because they gave me awful Van Heusen sweaters.  And I finally started giving them away on the air and saying how awful they were.  And they stopped getting me sweaters.  I'm like, I don't want gifts.  Just come.  I don't need anything.  I'm fine. 
[02:20:30]  What do you think of this guy's hair?  Why do I want that?  It's got like a, almost like a sea green under.  It really is.  It's undertones.  Why is your hair still green?  You're not still using the blue gel, are you?  You guys can't look great.  You should get a little sailboat and put it in your hair.  Exactly.  It's like a sea scene.  And if that doesn't work, try to pull it.  Charlie, I know a good colorist here.  Yeah.  Do you need...  It is green.  It's green.  It's green now.  Your hair is green now.  Sea green.  So it wasn't the dumb blue gel you said yesterday.  No, it is.  He had brown hair until two days ago. 
[02:21:00]  He had brown hair?  Yeah, he's a brunette.  He's 30.  He's 33 and decided he needed to do that.  Yeah.  That's hideous.  Something to do for Christmas.  That is an early midlife crisis.  Let's talk to Natasha.  What do you think, Natasha?  Don't hold back, because we certainly don't.  Hey, Sam, get up a picture of Iraq, too, so she can see...  I need to hear him talk a little bit more to see if it fits him.  He's not gay, right?  No.  Another one.  See, they always nod.  No, a lot of the women around here have asked the same thing.  They think he's gay.  They're a little confused by why he would do this.  You know, he's kind of pulling it off. 
[02:21:30]  He has a nice confidence about him.  Yeah.  That's how he used to look.  Only a mere couple days ago.  I like...  I think I like the natural look a little better.  Yeah.  She's being polite.  And when it was blonde the first day, it was weird enough, but now this sea green...  Now it's green.  The roots are going to be rough, too, darling.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that shit's going to start growing out immediately.  You're going to look like Stripe from Gremlins.  Yeah.  What if he did...  Oh, God, I got to turn his mic on.  You don't have to.  It's yours.  No.  It's not enforcing you. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, damn.  He's getting all snippy with you.  But I just had a theory about why Iraq did this, because he's been trying to figure it out.  What if he did it so people would appreciate how he looks without it?  So people would think he was handsome after it wore out.  I'm not that smart.  Oh.  No.  I didn't think that far ahead on that.  Are you a comedian?  No, I don't know.  Oh, boy.  No.  He's not even a production guy.  Are you an intern?  He's barely a human being.  Yeah, you're getting warmer.  I run the board around.  Well, see, he was born and raised in Florida, so I think he wants... 
[02:22:30]  I'm not from Florida.  He misses his Florida roots.  Yeah, he is.  That's what we think.  He's missing the whole sun thing.  Oh.  That's the one place I hate going is Florida.  Really?  Oh, shit.  Oh, she's making fun of where you're from.  My dad lives there.  Oh, okay.  We'll park down there.  We're tired.  It's like, it's a red state.  Like, even if you stay at a nice hotel, they're playing Toby Keith.  Like, in the nice hotel, like, there's just something's off about the whole place.  Do you like the, uh...  That's Eric on a boat in Florida.  That's how he got to school. 
[02:23:00]  That's who you're talking to right now.  That's how he got to school, though.  How cool is that?  If you're born and raised in Florida, you get to drive a boat to school.  Yes, exactly.  I mean, that looks nice enough, I guess.  You don't like Miami?  Miami's interesting.  What about, uh...  I don't work on my abs and my butt enough to really enjoy Miami.  I don't like Miami either.  It's my least favorite place there, because the crowds there are not...  A, I don't draw for shit.  And black and Latino acts do very, very well there.  But, like, I don't draw for shit.  And you just realize how ugly you really are when you start walking around Miami. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  You think you have a little confidence somewhere else, and you go down there and go,  Ah, I'm shit.  But you think Hollywood is cheesy?  Like, try the one in Florida.  Hollywood, Florida is cheesy?  I spent New Year's last year in Hollywood, Florida.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  What's cheesy about it?  Because they're like, everyone's kind of trying to do this glamour thing, but it's just off.  You got stuck spending New Year's in Hollywood, Florida?  I went with the comedians of Chelsea lately.  Oh, okay.  We did that.  Well, at least you had a gig, huh?  At least you had a gig, huh?  At least you had a gig, huh?  At least you had a gig, huh?  At least you had a gig, huh? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  That's great.  I thought maybe you did a bad date or something.  Yeah, right.  Hollywood, Florida.  There is Hollywood, Florida.  Baby, we're going to Hollywood, Florida.  Oh, my God.  Outside Fort Lauderdale?  Right.  It's the Hard Rock, right?  Yeah.  I've done that.  Between Fort Lauderdale and Miami.  Right in the middle.  See, we should have asked a guy from Florida.  Fuck.  Yeah, that's true.  He's from West Palm, though.  And isn't that...  Were you in the hotel where Anna Nicole Smith died?  No, I don't know.  Yeah.  I think she was...  That's where they do...  She died in Hollywood, Florida, right?  Yes. 
[02:24:30]  If I'm not mistaken, at the Hard Rock fucking hotel.  Did she really?  You might have been in her room.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, so that is, like, such an appropriate place for her to die.  Hollywood, Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  I read that when she got asked to, like, go to New York, she thought New York was in Hollywood.  Like, she was just confused as to, like, where.  I had this video.  I interviewed her for the roast, and it was a video of me online interviewing her, and  I got so much negative comments.  Like, it's so funny how the internet just connects to idiots. 
[02:25:00]  Like, people were just like, Anna, I love you, Anna.  You're my Anna.  There's, like, all these people who are just, like, their hero is Anna Nicole Smith.  It's so weird.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Well, now they all love Kim Kardashian.  For what reason, I still can't figure it out.  Did you hear she got banned from Australia?  For what?  Because she keeps lying about her visa.  It's, like, the third time she's lied and said she's not there to work.  I don't know if it's to, like, save money or something. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, she probably doesn't want to pay the taxes.  Exactly.  But it's, like, she's very recognizable.  Yeah.  And why else would she be going there?  Ugh.  They probably want to prevent all their black sports players from getting herpes.  She is so gross.  That's all you do now.  This is, like, the first time in history you can really make a living out of just being  a dork.  A dork.  Fucktard.  Like, you're just, like, a career.  It's like you're a careerist, but you're an idiot.  That's, like...  Yeah, she doesn't really do anything.  She doesn't really have any skills.  She's got a TV show, but she doesn't do anything.  Well, she fucked Brandy's brother. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  One thing she does.  That's all you do.  Yeah.  She released a perfume, and now she just retires.  Face marriage.  There's a really weird voyeurism with people like her, like, because people kind of don't  like her.  Kind of.  But there's not people that like her, but there's not people that hate her, too.  It's starting to turn.  A lot more people are starting to really hate that whole Kardashian thing.  It's all connected.  Like, Paris Hilton started it.  You know, I think it started as, like, remember Jessica Simpson was like, chicken?  I don't know what chicken is.  Oh, right.  And then everyone, like, it got all these views, and everybody was so enamored with her, 
[02:26:30]  and then she got a show, and then Paris Hilton kind of did it.  Like, you just kind of flaunt being dumb.  And then it's just kind of...  And then now, you know, Snooki's a New York Times best-selling author.  It's like, Simon & Schuster does not have to give her a book deal.  Like, why would you do that?  Yeah.  Have you read...  Like, I've read an excerpt of her book.  It's a novel.  It's just...  Is it fabulous?  I bet.  No, it's like about...  How bad is it?  It's just bad.  I mean, it's just like...  I don't get it.  It's a weekend at the shore. 
[02:27:00]  It frustrates the hell.  Oh, great.  I don't get it.  You got to also show a little snatch when you're getting out of a limo.  Yes, exactly.  That helps.  But I do think we're turning a corner here.  Oh, God, she's disgusting.  That's not even her book.  Really?  She was probably like a...  That's her second book.  Because it says New York Times best-selling author...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Boy, that's not as impressive anymore, huh?  How could she...  That used to be kind of impressive when you saw it on someone's book.  You're like, oh, fuck.  New York Times best-seller.  I might want to pick this up and read this one. 
[02:27:30]  Used to mean something more.  People who don't read books...  Poor Jimmy Norton was dubbed that.  Who?  Jimmy might have made the list.  Jimmy put a little book out.  That's her first one.  A short thing.  People who don't read books want to write them now.  It's just a...  Yep.  It's just what's happening.  She spelt sure wrong.  That's right.  She sure did.  And then, you know, they don't even write their own books.  On top of it.  No.  Oh, they don't?  They have...  No.  Maybe she did.  I don't know.  But you always see the other name.  Yeah.  And that means that guy wrote the fucking book.  I don't see it.  You know, this book was good, Flavor Flav, and it was really weird. 
[02:28:00]  You could tell he spoke it.  It was spoken and then transcribed, but because he did that, it was good.  It sounded like Flav.  Like him talking?  Yeah.  It was actually really...  I was surprised how much I liked his book.  Yeah.  Oh, you read that whole book?  We interviewed him for it, and we had just got...  He reads so much.  But I'm...  Yeah, I just felt like it.  Remember his show?  That was good.  I loved it.  That was just dumb fun.  I woke up for that show.  I was just like, oh, another episode.  Some of that shit, I don't mind watching, but Kardashians, why?  Well, at least reality shows don't treat you like an asshole. 
[02:28:30]  Like, sometimes you'll watch a show and you're like, this is so predictable.  I'm not stupid.  It's just...  Yeah.  It's like, at least with the reality shows, sometimes.  Sometimes.  Hey, sometimes they just like...  I watch them and go, oh, stop.  This is so scripted.  It's so fake.  You gotta watch TLC.  They've got some good shows on there.  Oh, I watched that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you seen the one where the My Strange Addiction?  Oh, yeah.  I love that.  That's one of our favorites.  The other one eating the rocks.  The other one eating their husband's ashes.  Rock Woman was great.  She was great, right?  I haven't seen the rock one. 
[02:29:00]  You haven't seen the...  Can you play a clip from Rock Woman?  The one with her pillow.  The black chick with her pillow.  She won't put her fucking pillow down.  Or the one who's like, loves eating toilet paper.  Yeah, yeah.  She's like a two-plow, a jumbo roll with a two-plow.  I could do that in about a day and a half.  Yeah.  They're kind of bragging.  Yeah, she puts it on a tongue like communion wafer.  The texture on that would drive me nuts.  That makes my fucking body like paper towel or whatever.  My tongue chewing it.  You think they're for real?  I think they want to get on TV.  I think everybody wants to get on TV rocks for dinner.  Oh, you got to see this one. 
[02:29:30]  I can't believe you told us about this, but now we're going to show you something.  I haven't seen that.  Rocks for dinner.  This one.  See hormones?  Six days sooner.  Digital test.  Yeah.  What a great woman.  Here we go.  Okay.  Oh, dramatic music.  Do not attempt to eat rocks at home.  My strange station.  And now happy music.  Yeah.  And I love that they pretend they're helping people.  Yeah.  My name's Teresa.  I'm 44 years old.  I live in Bedford, Virginia.  Pretty day today. 
[02:30:00]  And I'm addicted to eating rocks.  Oh, God.  I don't think I would be able to function every day if I didn't eat some coffee.  I mean, she's like obese.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, we should mention that.  Yeah, that's so.  Got a big pelican neck.  Yeah.  And, I mean, she's obviously eating something else.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not just rocks.  Rocks and cake.  I mean, she's just putting a lot of syrup on the rocks when the cameras are off.  A whipped cream.  I think people are this desperate to get on TV right now.  Yes.  Yeah, I would think so. 
[02:30:30]  All right, continue.  This gets great.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  Because it's a particular rock and all this shit.  Teresa has been addicted to eating rocks for more than 20 years.  Oh, wow.  She was initially attracted to the earthy smell.  I was just out walking one day.  Get a good line.  I had no intention of biting into it or chewing it.  She's a flatso.  But, yeah, I don't know if I did that.  She is terrible.  Now, Teresa can't go more than a few hours without eating rocks.  She's, like, chewing on a boulder.  It really is a boulder. 
[02:31:00]  That's great.  She got out in front of Rick Teresa.  I don't believe her.  Now, think she's just doing this to get on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, she probably saw the show.  She finds the soft rocks, though.  Go ahead.  I'm up.  I'm very worried about Teresa.  When your body can't handle what you're putting inside of it, it's going to rebel against you.  Give some fuck.  Die.  Teresa's favorite type of rock is a mixture of several minerals, including granite. 
[02:31:30]  That's all it's about.  She uses a hammer to break them up.  Takes a dump and trowels it out and puts her handprints in it.  This is about the fact I like it because it's not as hard to swallow.  I would normally take a piece like this and normally just put it in my mouth or bite on it.  Or just put the whole piece in my mouth.  Oh.  Yeah.  I've never wanted to see anybody choke so badly.  How great would it be?  Get the earthy taste off of it.  Give her a grenade here.  Enjoy this. 
[02:32:00]  Two pounds of rock a day.  That's about 730 pounds a year.  We'll do the math for you.  Like this is intervention.  So it doesn't really bother me.  I just hate that they pretend that they're helping people when it's clearly just a sideshow for psychos.  Freak show.  Because we all love the sideshow.  That's also with hoarders is the same thing.  I love watching hoarders.  TLC again.  TLC should stand for toddlers, lunatics, and cake.  They have like all those cake shows too.  Yes.  Who watches those?  There's dumb cake shows.  And there's not that much drama in making a cake. 
[02:32:30]  Wait.  You don't appreciate the cake boss?  No.  No one appreciates the cake boss?  No.  You're going to put the icing on like that.  I'm not going to stand for that kind of.  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  It's like the Sopranos meets like the cake.  Yeah, yeah.  Cake.  You try that one more time.  One.  There's like coming to blows.  Cake boss.  Stop it.  Look.  So he's like, he's got like a big personality.  That's the hook.  Oh, yeah.  Look at it.  I haven't seen it.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Whatever you call it.  No way.  No how.  So what's the occasion?  A wedding?  It's going to be prom night of the living dead. 
[02:33:00]  You guys hair.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  There's no drama around it.  No.  I need a cake.  All right, we'll make it.  Oh, how about all these shows that are out right now?  Do you guys watch those?  There's like Storage Wars.  There's so many of those.  There's like, they've got like five new ones about like the container store.  Yeah, Storage Wars.  And then there's, yeah, Storage Bid.  They bid on the storage units.  Is that good?  I mean, it must be something.  Oh, it's so great.  They open up the door.  Look at it. 
[02:33:30]  And I sold it for $100,000.  There's nothing in it but papers.  Good eye, Daryl.  Good eye.  This is why I buy storage walkers.  It's every man for us.  We bid on Hester Moffitt's.  Pause.  Hester Moffitt's.  Very good.  So what's the concept?  These are storage facilities that people just abandoned?  Yeah.  They defaulted on their storage unit.  That sounds good.  So they open it up and a bunch of people get to look in, but you can't move anything.  You can just look.  And then the bidding starts. 
[02:34:00]  And some people go like.  It's like the apocalypse.  I know.  Yeah, it really is.  They're bidding on their stuff they can't touch or afford anymore.  It's like fucking barter town in Thunderdome.  But you're looking at somebody else's misery.  That's like stripping a quadriplegic.  All right.  Who wants to fuck her?  Start with 50.  Yeah.  I expected.  I'm going to eat my yogurt now.  Jimmy.  I had to do that with us.  Wait.  So then you bid on it and then you get to take the stuff home?  Like it's like an auction?  Yeah.  And then after it's done, the people, they go in and they start opening up the boxes and  looking behind things that they couldn't see and go, oh, look, we got like fucking 
[02:34:30]  a beautiful Tiffany lamp that we didn't know was in here.  Have they found some good shit, though?  I've never seen them find anything really good.  What about pawn shops?  You like that one?  The pawn shop shows there's like one kind of real one, which is Pawn Stars, and then  there's Hardcore Pawn, which is totally fake.  Ew.  Oh, it sounds like porn.  I get it.  Yeah, I get it.  And that's the one that's in Detroit, I guess.  And they get like these, I don't know, these step and fetch it, set civil rights movement  back fucking 80 years come in and they're like, I'd like to sell this VCR. 
[02:35:00]  And they're like, what are you bringing this in for?  You know, you piece of shit.  And then they fight and it's fake.  What's the one with the gay couple?  That's American Pickers.  Well, I don't know if they're confirmed gay.  So they're like rag pickers?  Yeah.  What do they do?  Well, we don't know they're gay.  They drive around the country.  They like to talk about chicks a lot when they're on our show, but we're a little suspicious.  Oh, you've had them on the show.  We like them, actually.  Let the record stay.  We do like them.  We like those guys, but they talk about chicks and they shouldn't just to make it look like 
[02:35:30]  what do you guys like?  We like chicks, don't we?  Yeah.  All that over-the-top shit and we all look down like, oh, God.  They're organic.  Yeah.  They drive around the country looking for like old bicycles and like S.O. gasoline station  signs.  Sleeping in the same bed.  You don't know this one, Natasha?  No.  Sleeping in the same bed.  It's horrendous.  It is not a big deal to be on TV anymore.  No.  Tell me your vibe on these two guys.  We got a quick clip.  Oh, okay.  Great stuff.  We are the people to supply the antique dealers.  It's about us traveling and being the foot soldier of the multi-million dollar antique 
[02:36:00]  and collector business.  I'm looking for forgotten places and radical digs.  Oh, my God.  Radical.  Radical digs.  He's like the extreme in Twister.  Things are intriguing or unusual.  It would be $8 to $1,200 if it was in great shape.  I mean, I like their energy.  It's about the adventure.  Look at this.  Antiquing.  Let's have it on.  That's cool.  It's like extreme antiquing.  Extreme.  Extreme.  That antique's an F5.  Antique of God. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, that's not really my scene.  Oh, it's on the History Channel.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Kind of the same thing.  Bad Girls Club is great.  You ever watch that?  No.  Oh, it fucking rules.  You're a Bad Girls Club?  I've seen it.  It's all they do is drink and have real fistfights.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  See, they're at least...  Is that on now?  You don't know Bad Girls Club, Natasha?  They're finally admitting, look, we just want people to have conflict.  Oh, so they just fight?  Oh, they're just fighting.  They're in a limo right now in hot pants just fighting.  Let me explain further. 
[02:37:00]  There's no reason to do this show.  There's no prize nothing.  They just put it together like a cobra and a mongoose?  Yeah, and then they have those heart-to-heart conversations with their mom.  They're just fighting.  I'm not joking.  They have the heart-to-heart conversation with their mom back home like, I don't know if  I should stay in the house anymore.  And you know they're just giving them alcohol to kind of oil them up.  No one gets kicked out.  No one gets a prize in the end.  They're always wearing their swimsuits.  And it's called Bad Girls, so you've got to make sure you're the baddest girl in the  fucking house. 
[02:37:30]  That's the whole...  Do they eliminate people?  No, nothing.  They just keep on fighting.  They don't do any dumb...  What's...  What am I...  Elimination rounds or that stuff?  They don't do any dumb fucking day trips or any of that shit.  When I see ass pixelation, I'm in.  This is the whole show right here.  Wow.  They just fight, get drunk, and spit at each other.  They throw each other's clothes in the pool.  This is my childhood.  Is there a man they're fighting for? 
[02:38:00]  Nothing.  What do they fight over?  Like, what is there to...  Well, she's denying that she was the model for the Aunt Jemima bottle.  Wow.  What do you say?  Oh, and now they're all in bikinis fighting.  Fighting in a hot tub.  What are they fighting about in the pool or in the hot tub?  This is on Oprah...  Oh, no, that's on Oxygen.  Yeah, Oxygen.  Well, at least on Flavor Flav, they were, like, kind of fighting over, like... 
[02:38:30]  Like, the nastiest man in the world.  Like, that was kind of funny.  No, there's no winner.  There's no prize.  Yes.  There's no reason.  There's nothing.  Oh, man.  Sometimes I look at this stuff and I'm like, it seems like someone came...  Like, it's like we're in the future and there's just some weird apocalyptic...  Like, this is, like, not really what's...  If someone came, like, 20 years ago and saw this...  Yeah, that would be...  You would think it was, like, the end of the world.  Yes.  We've already been through World War III. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  It's post-apocalyptic.  It shows you how Paddy Chayefsky and Network, we've said it before, but what a genius he  was to understand...  You ever seen Network?  Yes.  In 76?  Yes.  Like, this is exactly what he saw coming long before reality TV existed.  Yeah.  Or, like, Idiocracy kind of did it as well.  Like, with, like, people are just...  It's all about the ads and just getting kicked in the balls to sell, like, tell-offs.  Yeah.  I respect this, though, because they're not faking anything.  That's right.  It's like, look, this is why you watch these dumb reality shows, so that's all we're going 
[02:39:30]  to give you.  A bunch of girls.  No guys of helping anyone.  No guys of a prize.  No.  There's no money involved.  There's nothing.  I would love to know why they're fighting so much.  They just...  Oh, alcohol.  You know how that is, Ant.  They, like, gave them rage.  Yeah.  They got...  They just filled the house with girls that have problems.  It's got a broken nose.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure it's from the show, too.  I think if you punch in the face they asked you to leave, there is some sort of a thing that  you can't...  They're still fighting.  Wow.  The table throwing is okay.  I'd be proud of the house if they hit another member of the house, but I've seen some fucking 
[02:40:00]  real fights and they stay in the house, so I don't know.  Do you think they pay these girls to be on this show?  I don't...  They might.  They probably get something.  It's probably a sad...  Yeah, yeah.  Probably something very...  Scale.  I like this, though.  The girls stay between the other girls' legs being yelled at, that point each other's  faces.  It's just funny that they're not even fighting over anything.  No.  No.  This looks exhausting.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I'm exhausted watching this.  I know.  All the yelling and hollering.  I don't know what's...  It's everything just imitating itself.  There's just downtime in between the fights.  That's it.  Or, you know, throwing some girls' clothes in the pool. 
[02:40:30]  I've got to watch it just to see what they would fight about.  It's great.  You would love this show.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's so ridiculous.  Give me an example of one fight, how it started.  Yeah, that was a montage of like...  I have no idea.  One fight.  One problem.  Where's my hair curler, bitch?  Here, what about the first one?  Because she's kind of saying...  If it was up your ass, you'd know what it was.  Oh, bitch!  It could be as easy as, you know, you're from West Philly and I'm from fucking just  for...  Oh, gang, gang, gang.  Just dumb stuff.  We got no towels in here because of this bitch. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  We're all in this together and Morgan has not got out of this.  She's not made any effort to even get to know any of us.  In fact, I hear her bitch and moan about being in here.  You knew what you went into when you started this.  Did she?  She has a sexy voice for five minutes.  Yeah, that's smokers.  That's like that road hard kind of like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's hot when you're talking dirty, but when we...  Heavy living.  Once they get older, it turns into Lucille Ball post-cancer.  Ah, Viv!  Viv! 
[02:41:30]  Are you guys serious?  Are you guys serious?  I'm going to know now.  We didn't touch your stuff.  We didn't touch your stuff.  But we need to know why they're going to fight.  Are you guys serious?  We didn't touch your stuff.  Who touched my stuff?  Who touched it?  Who touched it?  Who touched it?  The producers touched it, so you'd fight.  Who touched it?  So comfortable and so fabulous.  Get over yourself.  You're out.  All the girls talk like that.  They all have that smoke.  Miley Cyrus talks like that, too. 
[02:42:00]  Why'd you touch my stuff?  Oh, they packed her bags.  That's why.  Oh, they packed her bags.  Oh, shit.  Packed her bags.  Because they don't want her there anymore.  She's got 20 bags.  Yeah.  You bitches got me f***ed up.  Girl, girl.  You got me f***ed up.  Wait.  She sounds like Duvall in Apocalypse Now.  All right.  Like they should all be on Ritalin or something.  Yeah, they really need some type of drugs.  No, you're not going to be.  Oh, shit.  Clawing.  Bam. 
[02:42:30]  There they go.  There they go.  Clawing.  In a mansion.  It's so clearly set up.  Yeah.  Oh, this is the end now.  Oh, that's great.  Free for all at the end.  It's like freeze framing the kicks to the vagina.  It's like the Evil Dead 2 when he f***ing started killing them with a lawnmower.  No, stop.  Yo, yo, yo.  These girls attacked me.  They threw my stuff outside.  They've had a target on my back since I've been here out of jealousy.  Wow.  It's a hate crime.  A modern day hate crime. 
[02:43:00]  And they just had the whole place stocked with s**t to throw at each other.  Yeah.  There's that deep down mannequins in the f***ing house.  And there's like jewelry like laid out.  It's an anvil.  It's like a bag of golf balls.  This is hilarious.  I didn't know Jimmy watched.  Right on.  Yeah.  Yeah, we watch.  I mean, it's just great that there's no point.  None.  No point.  None.  No rules. 
[02:43:30]  That makes it great.  None.  I do not want to sit there and argue with no bitches.  I'm not going to front you.  I'm not going to front.  She's not going to front either.  What are you doing?  That's great.  That's what I was saying.  She's here like fucking.  The next one comes in.  Oh, I thought now we're just watching the show.  Yeah.  See, we're watching TV on the radio.  Yeah.  That's how we roll.  We're close to Christmas break.  This is what we do.  All right, all right.  This is what we do.  You can punch me.  I just feel like.  But Leah, you're not understanding what I'm telling you.  I didn't touch no one.  Get in.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, Jesus.  This is no way to behave.  Do they have neighbors?  That would be really sexy.  It's the same house in every reality show.  Who would agree to have their house used for this?  They just reused it for reality shows.  No, they rent it.  Yeah.  Is this the Flavor Flav house?  That's what I did with the Osmo.  No, I know, but who would rent their house?  I know.  To the bad girls.  Yeah.  Kat's overreacting for no reason at all. 
[02:44:30]  I have no idea why she's bugging out.  It has nothing to do with her.  Because everybody is, apparently.  Oh, I know.  I understand your frustration, but don't do no nut-ass punk ass.  They all just walk around.  Nut-ass.  Nut-ass punk ass.  Yeah.  Shit-ass ass ass.  Oh, jeez.  All the boobs are bouncing.  Yeah.  It's the greatest.  There's a lot of girls.  Yeah.  It's like 15 chicks.  And they're all bad.  Yeah.  It's like naughty.  The thought of these bitches even touching my things is enough to make me snap. 
[02:45:00]  It's a total violation.  Bitch, what is the least of your fault?  So they're like...  They're just pushing shit over.  Every chair is like on a single little leg, so very easy to push over.  Holy f***, this is really happening.  I feel set up.  I don't really know which direction to go.  Is that your type?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Just a fucking alcoholic and a slut.  Walking around in a bra with like way too much bronzer on.  Fist fighting. 
[02:45:30]  Fucking fine.  Body makeup.  Yeah.  Just causing problems wherever she goes.  Absolutely.  You love that, huh?  Camel soap.  A little creep.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  No, f*** you.  Uh-oh.  The fight went too far.  You're not going out there.  Uh-oh.  Season five?  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Season five?  I know.  It does great.  It does great.  No.  Oh, yeah.  This is the fifth season of this show.  It must not be yearly seasons.  I'm moving to France.  Every month is a season. 
[02:46:00]  It's a wonderful show.  Yeah, bad girls.  Every month is a season.  Yeah, it's our new season.  Check it out.  Funny what they call cycles now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Because they want to do more than one a year.  That's hilarious.  I'm going to have to check that one out.  I have not seen that one.  I learned so much today, you guys.  Yeah, we do an educational show.  This is like the learning channel.  And you've got some crumb cake.  Yeah, a little crumb cake.  That crumb cake was good.  Natasha rules.  Let's just be honest with each other.  Thank you, guys.  I hope it was...  Absolutely.  Caroline's all weekend through Sunday, 212-757-4100.  Oh, no, I'm not doing Sunday. 
[02:46:30]  What?  I'm going to Hawaii with Chelsea Handler.  Oh.  To do a gig or a vacation?  Vacation.  Really?  She just takes her staff away?  She's taking me.  Oh.  What's that about?  Well, I mean, she's taking a few people.  That's nice.  What have we got here?  I'm very excited.  You know, she...  Yeah, it's a private plane.  What?  Oh.  Have you ever been on a private plane?  I have once.  I dated a guy who was really rich.  Wow.  What kind of job did he have?  His dad had a nice job.  Oh, boy. 
[02:47:00]  Did he fly the plane himself?  Uh, no.  No.  No, no.  But the only thing that really appeals to me is not having to go to the airport.  That is a good thing.  And get yelled at by, like, you know...  Yeah.  Everybody.  It's pretty bleak right now, flying.  That is the greatest thing about private air travel, is not dealing with the fucking airport.  I've never flown private.  I've never flown.  Dude, you pull right up.  I've never flown private.  I took a private to Foxwoods, and you just...  The limo literally pulls up to the plane. 
[02:47:30]  No one checks you.  You just walk in, you're holding bags of booze and everything.  You get on, and you're just drinking.  Don't you think that's where the next problem will be?  Might be, but in the meantime, fuck it.  It's great.  Who brings bags of booze to a casino?  Me.  That was the thing we all missed there.  Me.  It's a 45-minute flight to Connecticut.  Oh, we got stuck, though.  We got caught in a fucking crazy rainstorm, and it was fog.  In the private plane?  Yeah.  And we wound up circling, like, around the Long Island Sound for a good hour. 
[02:48:00]  Were you bouncing around?  Yeah, it was crazy.  The other people that were with me thought we were going to die.  And I was just drinking, laughing, like, I don't fucking worry about it.  That's scary.  Yeah.  And then the pilot, when we finally landed, I saw the baggage guy.  He's, like, taking the bags out and stuff.  And he was just kind of this chubby, black guy, just getting the bags out.  And then I realized he was the pilot.  He's the same guy that takes the bags out.  Oh, really?  I'm like, oh, gee.  Oh, we were in there in that really bad weather, weren't we? 
[02:48:30]  That is so scary.  Yeah, it was pretty scary.  But I was intoxicated, so I didn't give a shit.  Well, it's...  Drinking's great when you fly.  So she goes, Hawaii Friday is what she said.  Ah.  Oh, so Sunday.  So I can't...  No Sunday, Caroline.  I'm not doing my Sunday show, you guys.  So just tonight and tomorrow.  Although I didn't tell the club, that's why.  Can we delete that?  Well, Greg is forgiving.  Greg Charles will watch this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  But I'm here.  We have two shows tonight and two shows Saturday.  All right.  212-757-4100.  We need to work for somebody that takes us away. 
[02:49:00]  That's nice.  Oprah does it, and I guess Chelsea does it.  Chelsea's extremely generous.  That's pretty cool.  With everybody.  She's, you know...  I like that.  Somebody that takes care of their fucking people, man.  Some people are just fucking stingy, and some people...  It's a way of life.  You either have to decide, am I going to be generous with everything and make everybody  else's life around me great, or I'm going to be scared and stingy and save all my money.  All right.  Yep.  Make my staff fly public. 
[02:49:30]  Twitter, Natasha Leggero.  L-E-G-G-E-R-O.  Start following.  Yeah, you're up.  Jimmy, you got some pisses, as they say here in New York.  I like doing Twitter.  It's fun.  I feel like I give all my comedy ideas away on Twitter, though.  It's a bad habit.  Trying to show off, and then you're like, eh, I probably should have...  Well, I'm just like...  No, I'm just lazy.  I'd rather just tweet it than try to memorize it and make it into a bit.  Tweet the general idea.  Do you do that, Jim?  Yeah, I'll throw out concepts of things that could have been funny, but I'll still do them 
[02:50:00]  on stage, because I figure everyone's not reading my Twitter.  Nah, I think only like 10% of the people actually read your Twitter.  Yeah, I don't like to follow your followers.  If that much.  Oh, I don't know.  My people are dedicated.  If that much.  I've got to follow you.  Oh, maybe I am.  Yeah, I'm just...  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I just ran out of steam.  Yeah, what happened?  I'm just tired.  You're all right.  No, you've got a plug to do, though.  You've got to get that done.  Oh, sorry.  No, it's okay.  Tonight, I will be in the Sweet Basil Restaurant in Queensbury. 
[02:50:30]  You know how humiliating this is to plug in front of another comedian?  Oh, that's...  Oh.  I literally would be like saying, listen, my Polish jokes contest starts tonight.  This is...  And tonight and tomorrow in Queensbury.  How far is that?  Three and a half hours.  It'll be about 25 years.  Sweet Basil Restaurant.  It's in Queensbury, New York.  It really...  It's probably better than it sounds.  It has to be.  But let me do this for Jimmy, because, you know, he's a humble man. 
[02:51:00]  He's going to some of these out-of-the-way places to work on his special that's coming  up soon.  Yeah, why would you work on that in front of everybody?  I mean, that makes sense.  Well, it gives him an opportunity to go to places he normally wouldn't go, either.  Yeah, I do.  It works out for everybody.  When I'm working on an hour, I try to, you know...  Yeah.  I actually like these gigs.  I wound up doing a long set.  You really enjoy them, right?  It's just as...  You know, and I love doing them, but there's nothing worse when there's another comedic  end.  Sweet Basil.  Yeah.  Do they have Basil on everything?  I was flying private to Hawaii on Sunday to go, listen, while she's fucking zipping 
[02:51:30]  around over the Pacific in a private plane, I'll be driving home from Queensbury.  Oh, you guys, I've never done anything like that.  I was not trying to...  You were bragging.  Well, I just think it's kind of funny.  You guys, come on.  If I was going to Hawaii on a private plane, I'd brag my ass off.  Fuck it.  I'm excited.  I'm also going to Hawaii, but I'm taking a bus.  Sweet Basil.  Yeah, yeah.  Two tonight and two tomorrow.  I mean...  You think they like their basil?  I hope so. 
[02:52:00]  So they're going to be eating spaghetti.  Yeah.  Have you ever done this place, Captain O'Brien's in Florida?  Yes, I did.  It's a seafood restaurant, and people are learning how to eat lobster in the front row.  Oh, no.  That's bad.  Just cracking.  Cracking shells.  Yeah, there's a giant shark on the fucking...  On dates.  It's like a seafood...  I don't know how you guys do half this shit.  They pay like an improv.  But I did...  It's a good club.  It was okay.  I didn't like the show.  I did four shows there, and they asked me to cancel one because it was a very small crowd. 
[02:52:30]  And I was like, okay, because it was out of season.  I was like, fine.  And I didn't mind taking the financial hit.  But then the owner doesn't even come out and go, hey, man, thanks for doing that.  I'm like, you motherfucker.  I gave you back 25% of the money.  You can't even go, thanks?  Like, I was totally fine with doing it.  So, blech.  Well, Sweet Basil's going to be better than that.  I sure hope so.  And I hope they have something interesting on the wall.  No, Sweet Basil's a fucking window.  There's a giant window behind you looking into a field.  It's horrendous.  Holy shit.  If you want to assassinate me, believe me, tonight or tomorrow is how I'm going to do it. 
[02:53:00]  That's pretty fucked up.  But you know what?  As a comedian, whenever you're in those situations, it always makes you funnier.  I feel like the more success and money you get, the less funny.  Right.  It's very, it stimulates you to be in those funny situations.  I'll do the improv where I put my thumb over my shoulder and go, what's this out here?  The woods or something?  I'll turn around.  It's hysterical.  Do a whole bunch of...  It's a good one.  Chainsaw Massacre.  Ah, that'll be crazy. 
[02:53:30]  I'll sit on a stool.  Is there really a window looking at a field?  A gigantic window.  You're looking into the woods.  Fucking awful.  So you pissed off someone Friday night and now they're in the field Saturday night.  To do a comedy straw dogs.  Fucking horrendous.  What the fuck?  That doesn't sound like a good idea.  Oh, I think it's going to be great.  All right, Natasha.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Come back and see us.  We'll see you guys.  Okay, thank you for having me.  No, you're great.  Thanks for coming.  You guys are awesome.  We're going to do a couple days next week, I guess.  Yes.  And then we'll get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Let's get out of here like right now.  Chop, chop.  You're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show.
