<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a significant amount of repeated audio labeled "B.A.N.M.D.I."  The hosts then launched into a discussion of "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging listeners with Opie and Anthony bumper stickers to flash women from their cars.  They debated the segment's practicality in various climates,  leading to a conversation about potentially relocating the show from New York due to the cold weather.  Opie also mentioned his illness and an upcoming doctor's appointment.  A caller, Benita, questioned the appeal of "Whip Em Out Wednesday" for women, sparking a discussion about gender differences in public displays of this nature. The conversation segued into Hawk's birthday and Colin's performance on a celebrity poker show.  They briefly mentioned Malcolm-Jamal Warner as a guest and revisited the previous day's contentious "Bernie" segment, which featured a man named Bernie who was repeatedly antagonized by the hosts.

A caller, Charlie, shared their reaction to the Bernie segment.  Opie read an email from Bernie himself, summarizing the previous day's events.  A discussion about moving the show to Nashville was interrupted by a call from Matt, who warned against the move due to Nashville's cold winters. Opie teased an upcoming segment featuring a guest who emailed about their bisexuality and ownership of a strap-on.  The conversation returned to the Bernie segment and listener reactions.  Unexpectedly, Bernie himself arrived in the studio, leading to a tense confrontation before he ultimately left.  The hosts then humorously speculated about the disappearance of their intern, Ricky, who had been sent for coffee and was significantly delayed returning, eventually admitting to getting lost despite being only a block away.  Ricky's repeated errors were also discussed.

The show then moved on to a discussion about the movie *Napoleon Dynamite*, followed by a conversation about in-car black boxes used to monitor drivers' behavior, and the ethical implications, particularly concerning teenagers and parental monitoring.  Several caller interactions and further discussions about tracking technologies concluded this segment.

The next segment began with a funny story from a listener about a childhood movie mishap involving *Saturday Night Fever*. This led to crude jokes and embarrassing movie experiences.  The main focus shifted to a prank call with "Bill," a seemingly disoriented and possibly intoxicated individual who repeatedly called, resulting in increasingly absurd and hilarious exchanges. This was followed by a heated, profane debate about the firing of radio personality Shannon Burke from XM, with Burke blaming Opie and Anthony. The hosts vehemently denied responsibility and boasted about their success. The segment concluded with a call from "Wheelchair Fred," detailing graphic accounts of his recent bisexual experiences, including anal sex, resulting in much humorous and crude back-and-forth with the hosts.  No guests were in studio besides the hosts.

The following segment featured another call from "Wheelchair Fred," who discussed his sex life, use of a strap-on, and desire for sexual partners, providing his email address (Wheeler Derp at AOL.com).  This was followed by an interview with Drew Curtis, founder of FARC.com, where he discussed the website's content, traffic (1.7 million hits), community, and contests, including details about a bizarre gun-involved sex incident.  After the interview, the hosts discussed RateMyWOW.com, a website featuring nude photos of women, with explicit commentary.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a news story about a murdered actress, leading to a frank, and at times offensive, conversation about race, violence, and media portrayals within the black community, including listener calls on the subject.

The next segment started with a caller discussing racial double standards and violence, followed by a debate on the glorification of violence in media with caller Jimmy, who ultimately advocated for parental guidance and education. Jimmy unexpectedly announced his presidential candidacy. The hosts played "That's Why Doggies Were Born" by Kate Smith, followed by a news story about a teacher berating students for not standing during the National Anthem, including audio of the outburst. This led to a discussion about the hostsâ€™ own experiences with yelling parents.  Jerry Ferrara, star of *Entourage*, called in to discuss his career and experiences. The hosts then engaged in banter about their producer Ben, followed by more discussion about Wheelchair Fred and a past near-violent incident with the audience involving an attempt to get him to walk.  Further calls were taken, including one promoting a website.  They returned to the teacher audio, followed by audio of Bobby Knight yelling, leading to a discussion about abusive teachers. Finally, Laszlo, known for his Grand Theft Auto work and technology news feature, joined the show, recounting a chaotic studio incident involving Bernie Getz and Master Poe, who almost fought. Laszlo discussed his technology news, the dot-com boom, day trading, remote control helicopters, and technology trade shows, often using profanity and off-color remarks.


The final segment discussed Anthony's day trading and online poker habits, touching upon online poker payment processing, government regulation of online gambling, and the hosts' cynical views on government priorities. A caller, Effie, shared gruesome stories about radio-controlled helicopter accidents.  The conversation then focused on technological advancements over the past decade, the pervasiveness of computers and the internet, government surveillance, the Real ID Act, and RFID technology.  They discussed privacy concerns regarding technologies like E-ZPass and RFID tracking in supermarkets, and the potential obsolescence of traditional media. The segment concluded with a discussion of a humorous audio piece by Laszlo, plugs for his comedy show, and a birthday wish for Eric.

The Opie and Anthony show.  B.A.M.D.I.  B.A.M.D.I.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the roll.  B.A.M.D.I.  B.A.M.D.I.  B.A.M.D.I.  B.A.M.D.  B.A.M.D.I.  B.A.M.D.I.  Medications don't work.  What medications do you have?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  You battling incompetent.  You blundering bag of poop.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You have a chance to come out of my eyes? 
[00:05:00]  Hello, exactly.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  All right.  You're not being fair.  This isn't fair.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear. 
[00:05:30]  Karen's going to live in Chestnut Hill in that neighborhood of Philadelphia.  Karen.  Hi there.  Well, we're not just talking the side streets anymore here in Chestnut Hill like the one  you see over there.  Germantown Avenue.  Excuse me.  Satellite Radio.  Open Anthony.  Ben, as of this moment, they're on double secret probation.  That's great.  Ah, we love the assaults on the media, right, Anthony?  I love when a complete tool runs in front of each camera like that.  I was checking out the video on foundrymusic.com and openanthony.com last night. 
[00:06:00]  Very, very funny stuff.  Funny stuff.  Who was that?  Who did that?  Uh, Hummer Cash from whackbag.com.  Hummer Cash.  I look forward to the next one, Anthony.  You never know when it's going to happen.  Ah, you never know.  They just pop out of nowhere.  We're just such pains in the asses.  Wham.  Good morning.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Oh.  Not here. 
[00:06:30]  No, we're in crappy weather hell.  I haven't.  For the next, like, ten days or so, I guess.  Ugh.  And then I guess spring will hit, hopefully.  I don't know.  Sure.  Why not?  But Whip Em Out Wednesday is a great, great concept.  It works.  Trust me, it works.  And it's very easy.  You just get a wow on your car, your vehicle.  We don't care how the wow gets there, whether it's one of these official Opie and Anthony  wow bumper stickers.  Ooh.  That you can get by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to where we broadcast here in 
[00:07:00]  New York City.  The address is on opianthony.com.  You slap that on your ride, your vehicle.  And then if the ladies feel like it, they will flash you.  Yes, they will.  They'll just drive around, see it, know what it's for.  You'll be driving, not thinking anything, maybe stuck in traffic.  You'll look over and, oh, see a beautiful set of boobage.  And your job is simple.  You throw the wow in your car and just go about your life.  Just go about your driving.  Do not harass the women.  There are plenty of women out there that'll do it just for the hell of it. 
[00:07:30]  And you truckers out there, you guys rock for riding wow in the back of your trucks.  You know, we also like the homemade wow signs.  It's taken on a life of its own, which is very, very cool.  It certainly has.  And I can't wait until we here in the New York area can enjoy it once again.  It's a seasonal thing here.  Some areas, that's year-round.  Arizona.  Oh, year-round.  They're enjoying wow all year long.  That's right.  All year long.  Sure.  Maine.  Florida.  Yeah.  Maine gets to enjoy it for, what, a month?  Maybe a month. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buffalo was like that, man, when I was living up there.  It's like, ah, spring's here.  Wait, now it's fall.  What?  It's winter again?  What happened?  Summer's like, I think, three weeks long up in Buffalo when I was living up there.  But it was just summer.  Oh, it's the worst.  Like, summer hits like July.  Yeah.  And then the first snowstorm is, like, early October.  I don't know how you lived up there.  No way.  It's bad enough here in New York.  We really, really have to seriously give thought to broadcasting from somewhere else in the winter. 
[00:08:30]  Next winter?  Yeah.  Done deal.  Where?  Nashville.  You think Nashville?  I don't know.  Nashville is becoming a nice XM hub.  It is?  A press release went out.  They're, like, expanding their Nashville offices.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That's where Elo's been the last couple days.  Elo's been in Nashville?  Yeah.  So you can come back with big sideburns and Elvis glasses.  That'd be nice.  Good look for him.  Imagine that haircut with sideburns. 
[00:09:00]  That's hilarious.  So, anyway, I'm dying, man.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, I've been good.  You know that.  Yes.  In the old days, I used to get sick all the time.  But there's the, I don't know.  I got, like, the upper respiratory thing happening.  How's the dumps?  How have they been going?  Good?  Yeah, that's taken care of.  That's taken care of.  Problem solved?  Problem solved, I think.  I think. 
[00:09:30]  So far, so good.  Lately.  Thanks for asking.  Well, you know.  I get the same sickness every year, and it's an upper respiratory thing, and it, like,  it lingers for, like, two weeks.  It just, it takes forever to go away.  Yeah.  Medication, for the most part, doesn't help.  Doesn't work.  Not really.  Medication doesn't work.  Yeah.  So, we have a little burning.  Yeah.  Don't make me laugh too hard.  Let's have a really boring show today, so I don't have to laugh and hurt myself.  No problem. 
[00:10:00]  What?  No, I'm just a little worried about you.  No, I'm fine.  I'm going to my doctor on Friday, anyway, for the annual physical.  Uh-oh.  Another finger?  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  Another finger up the pooper?  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  Ow.  Let's go to Benita in Florida.  Benita.  Hey.  What's up, Benita?  Nothing's up.  I was just wondering how us girls get to enjoy the WOW sticker that I don't have, because  I'm afraid to put on my car.  Well, I don't know.  No fear. 
[00:10:30]  No fear.  Benita?  Yeah.  You just put it on there.  Girls enjoy it, because I've noticed a lot of girls like looking at girls' breasts, too.  That could be true, but I don't.  And I live in South Florida.  There's plenty of opportunities.  Oh, really?  This is just a, I don't know, this is a guys thing, I guess, for the most part.  It absolutely is.  We've had girls that have said, oh, can't you make it, you know, whip it out Wednesday  where your guys pull out there.  Oh, no.  I guess not.  And, no, see, guys see boobs on the road and stuff, everyone's happy.  A woman sees a penis on the road, there's cops involved, and a chase, and maybe death. 
[00:11:00]  It's just never, it's never as happy and fun when a cock comes out.  Yeah, plus it is when boobs come out.  Plus, it's a lot easier to flash a boob than, you know, a guy flashing his junk as he's driving  eight miles an hour down the highway.  You're pushing your pelvis up to the window.  You're like straight.  Yeah, your foot is like slammed on the gas pedal, because you're trying to get your dick  to the window.  You look ridiculous. 
[00:11:30]  Your head's all bent, because the head restraint is hitting the back of your neck.  Look at my cock, girls.  It just doesn't work.  You sound experienced.  No.  It just, it's just, there's no real other way to get it up to the window, unless you're,  you know.  Yeah, I guess, unless you're really a dwarf.  Hung like Mike Tyson or something, where you could just flap it over your shoulder and  say, ladies, take a look.  Also, the wow just, you know, shows your support of the show as well, so.  That's true.  Okay, then I'll try to get myself one. 
[00:12:00]  I mean, I'm a nurse, so I was wondering how you're feeling.  I'm doing all right.  Yeah, I have a cold, too.  It's been lingering for about three weeks now, so I know how you feel.  Linger longer.  All right, I'm punching out.  I'm at work.  All right, thank you, Benita.  Bye.  Now, the faithful listeners know, you know, you just throw the wow in your car and then  go about your business, and no one's supposed to harass anyone.  Right.  And it's worked like a charm for the last, I don't know, seven or eight years now.  Eighteen years, I think.  Eighteen years we're up to. 
[00:12:30]  In that small laboratory where you invented wow, Opie, it's been 18 years.  Why would the birthday boy hand me poker chips first thing in the morning?  Are you insane?  Yeah.  Happy birthday?  Yeah, Hawk's birthday today.  Happy birthday.  Sex Bagels birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Wow.  You know what I do at the end of that song to get big laughs?  I'll say, how old are you?  People always laugh, and then they'll tell you.  That's how old are you now?  No.  That's great.  How old are you?  Now I get to play my new game all morning. 
[00:13:00]  No poker chips.  You're going to.  The audience hates the poker chips.  Why would you hand them over to me?  Even I know that you shouldn't have done that.  Here, take them back.  Did you see Colin last night on the celebrity poker?  I thought that was a replay.  No, because he won the last one, so now he was in the tournament of champions.  And he came in second.  He played awful.  I mean, awful.  And he had this huge chip pile again, and everyone was just mocking him. 
[00:13:30]  They were laughing at him, because he plays horrible.  And he was doing very well.  But then he lost to, what's his name, the brother on Everyone Loves Raymond.  By Garrett.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Oh, guys.  Yeah.  And they had a, what's his name from the Cosby show there?  Jamal.  Yeah.  Jamal Warner.  Welcome Jamal Warner.  Malcolm Jamal Warner. 
[00:14:00]  And George Costanza.  Yeah.  They were both on.  And some broad.  I don't even know who she was.  And Colin came in second.  He got, he was pissed off at the way, so who told him to play like that?  Jimmy just loaded a big mouthful of cereal in his mouth.  Jesus.  I asked him a question.  He looks over with this horrified look on his face with milk coming out of his mouth.  I'm not a big deal.  Dude, I've never seen anyone eat more cereal at one time than you.  I recall.  No, dude, I'm just hungry.  I'm trying to eat.  You're very hungry. 
[00:14:30]  What are you using?  One of those big ladles to scoop it into your mouth?  My little mouth.  Very funny.  I, uh, I called him to some poker expert.  I knew he lost last week.  He said some poker expert gave him advice.  He's like, that's why I lost.  Because we were teasing.  I was teasing the way he was playing.  Yeah.  But it was working for him.  Yeah.  He was doing great.  And then at the end, he, uh, yeah, he kind of changed his strategy and, and he lost.  But he did a good job.  And it was fun to watch though, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Charlie from Whack Bag.  What's up, Charlie? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Charlie.  Man, yesterday my voice is gone too.  Yeah.  But, uh, I was at work yesterday listening to the replay of the Bernie thing.  Yeah.  And as you asked him what, if that was his CD, I screamed at the, at the, at the monitor,  No!  No!  Oh, what a mad man.  And then I put my hand over my mouth like a little girl as you broke it.  And he said, you motherfucker.  Yeah, so much for that vegetarianism, right?  Yeah, I was cracking up, man. 
[00:15:30]  Makes you mellow.  And, uh, if you're a vegetarian, there won't be as much violence.  And, uh, keep the CD, motherfucker.  Wow.  You're asking for trouble.  You're asking for trouble, Opie.  You never want to hear, you're asking for trouble, uh, for trouble.  Oh.  From a subway vigilante.  From Bernie.  All right.  Thank you, Charlie.  Thank you.  Yeah, that was a lot of fun yesterday.  Ooh.  I swear to God, dude.  I walked home yesterday.  I, I kept looking over my shoulder the whole way.  Yeah.  The whole way. 
[00:16:00]  A little scary.  A little scary.  And Bernie Pye has, uh, written us, uh, an email, Anthony.  Yeah.  He says, uh, everything's fine.  I flipped for a few minutes.  Everything's okay now.  That's all he writes.  Was that written in 1984?  I mean, that's exactly what happened.  That's, that's, I flipped for a few minutes.  Yeah.  That's, that's what he, uh, wrote to Ben.  Everything's fine.  I flipped for a few minutes.  Everything's okay now.  That's it.  Not dear Ben.  No. 
[00:16:30]  Love Bernie.  Whatever.  That's all he writes.  That was the entire message.  He flipped for a few minutes.  Flipped for a few minutes.  That's what we were gunning for.  But it's okay.  Hey, now I'm hearing that, uh, maybe Nashville's not the place to go in the winter.  Uh, Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, O.N.?  Hey.  Hey, Sugar Tits.  How you doing?  Mm, I'm good.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, I just want to tell you that, uh, it is frigid in Nashville in the winter, man.  You gotta go further south, brother.  Yeah, I think it's cold in Nashville. 
[00:17:00]  That's dangerous.  No, it's freaking freezing.  I was stationed down there.  It's not nice.  Screw that.  We need warmth.  But I've never been in Nashville.  We should just, uh, I don't know.  We should do a few shows from Nashville if they got studios down there.  That'd be fine in the spring or summer.  Yeah, maybe in the spring or something we'll do a little trip to Nashville.  But as far as broadcasting through the winter, we gotta go to, like, Florida.  All right, I'm punching out.  Arizona.  L.A.  L.A. even.  Yeah, L.A. even, you know.  Oh, it's fun.  Yeah, L.A. would be great.  L.A.'s a good place.  All right.  And I want to tease something, Anthony. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  One of our, uh, regular, uh, guests, I guess you might say, wrote me an email.  Uh-huh.  And it says...  Yes.  Don't give it away.  Okay.  It says simply, I am sorry, but I think I'm still bisexual.  I must admit, I do like it up the ass.  I even have a strap on.  Now to find a chick to use it on me.  Bernie?  We will be talking to that person a little later on in the show. 
[00:18:00]  Bob Kelly in again?  No?  We'll be talking to that person later on in the show.  All right.  Can I ask you after that email, why are we talking to that person?  What is it going to say besides hello?  Ugh.  Trust me.  It'll be the highlight of the show today.  Okay.  Is it Tim from that rapper, uh...  Oh, from Gangster, uh, Fag?  Gangster Fag?  Yeah, a lot of, uh...  His buddy Tim.  A lot of people loved the Gangster Fag stuff yesterday.  And a lot of people hated it.  Well, that's what this show's all about.  You either love it or hate it.  That's right.  I mean, the email on the Bernie thing yesterday? 
[00:18:30]  Right down the fucking middle.  I don't get it.  Half the people loved it, and half the people couldn't be bothered with Bernie.  I don't get how you don't, uh, how you enjoy this program and don't enjoy segments  like Bernie gets, where he's up there babbling, and we are just relentlessly lobbing goofs  at him.  Isn't that what the show's about?  That's what the fucking show's about!  It's not so much about what Bernie's saying.  What do you think?  We want to sit him down and have an in-depth interview about his, uh, uh, opinion of the 
[00:19:00]  gates?  Or, or, you know, his run for mayor, or what should happen at Ground Zero?  Is that all the people that don't like Bernie?  Is that what they're listening to?  Or are they listening to the snide asshole comments that have been made at his expense?  Yeah.  And then he gives us something like this.  This one, right?  It says, um, on the front.  Oh!  What are you, motherfucker?  Tony!  Tony!  Oh, he's coming over there!  Oh, Bernie! 
[00:19:30]  Bernie, sit down!  Sit down!  Oh, my God!  Wait!  He's really mad.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off Bernie guys.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right, sit down.  Stand up for your right, Bernie!  Sit down, Bernie!  Sit down!  It's okay!  It's okay!  It's okay, Po!  Po, it's okay!  It's okay!  Po, it's okay! 
[00:20:00]  Po, it's okay!  Po, it's okay!  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh!  Oh!  I know I'm able to get that fucking seat.  Oh, yeah!  Yeah, hand over that fucking seat.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  He's right.  Oh, he's fine, Po.  You tell him to relax.  Po, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Nobody relax.  All he did was take the seat.  I mean...  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the seat. 
[00:20:30]  I won't be here again.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie's leaving!  Oh, man.  So much for soy milk, huh?  Fuck you.  Keep the seat.  I won't be back again.  So much for eating carrots.  Yeah.  Broccoli.  My God, broccoli, sure.  What happened?  He went from little mild-mannered guy to the subway vigilante again.  We brought that back out.  I'm going to stick to eating meat, I think.  You think he's had that rage since 20 years? 
[00:21:00]  Do you think that rage has surfaced some other time?  No, I'm sure.  Yeah?  I'm sure.  We're not the only ones that have brought it out in him?  But once again, his email this morning, everything's fine.  I flipped for a few minutes.  Everything's okay now.  Keep your fucking CD.  I won't be back.  Wow.  You're asking for trouble.  You're asking for trouble.  That's great.  My favorite part of that is because of the delay.  Poe runs in, and Ecstasy of the Gold is playing this morning.  What's going on?  Nothing.  And there was definitely a pretty serious situation in here. 
[00:21:30]  Eric was doing a great job holding Bernie back because, I don't know, I would have done  something really stupid.  And then Poe comes in, and you don't know what Poe's going to do, so we're trying to  calm Poe down, making sure he understands that it's bad, but it's not that bad.  Yeah.  Because you don't want Poe to all of a sudden just knock Bernie out.  It was just crazy.  Absolutely crazy.  Does anybody know where the fuck Ricky is?  What happened? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, my goodness.  What's wrong?  Oh, boy.  I sent him for a coffee before the show started.  It was before the show started.  Where the hell is he?  For a medium coffee with a little bit of milk.  Well, he's not buying it from those savages.  What?  He hasn't come back yet.  He hasn't come back?  I hope he's all right.  See, I'm thinking maybe he had a problem down in the streets of New York, the tough streets.  I'm thinking that's the only acceptable answer.  If I look outside, and I see the cherries spinning on an ambulance, and they're loading that little 
[00:22:30]  incompetent into the back, where's Ricky?  He got lost.  No, he didn't.  What?  I'm not kidding.  We sent him to the new place for food, and I don't think he found his way back.  Oh, I sent him for Starbucks.  That's right around the corner.  I know.  He didn't know where he was going.  How do you get lost in Manhattan at this hour?  This is Ricky.  It's a grid.  Maybe he got in the middle of some intern wars.  Oh, really?  Maybe there's some pop-pop going on.  There's been some gunfire outside our studios, like Hot 97?  Yes, Nathaniel. 
[00:23:00]  Well, I just got Jim's delicious, hopefully, banana at the place Ricky's supposed to be at.  No sign of him.  Oh, my God.  He's probably just wandering around Central Park trying to find his way back here.  He's a little slow.  Nate G is going to slink some lead into him when he gets back here, I bet.  He's going to have some gunfire.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, well.  He's not lost.  Does he have a cell phone or anything?  Of course not.  He probably ain't going to know how to answer it.  He's a little slow.  A little slow.  Nice kid. 
[00:23:30]  You know how the streets work in Manhattan?  They're numbered.  They go up and down.  It's pretty easy.  If you're on 56th and you have to get to 57th, you pretty much know where you've got to go.  He's been gone a half hour and all he had to do was cross the street.  All I wanted was coffee.  This is why the rule is, no, he can't touch my food because this stuff happens all the time.  All I wanted was coffee.  All the time, Jimmy.  All the time with him.  How's your banana?  Is it too hard?  Well, Nathaniel got it.  No.  It's a perfect banana. 
[00:24:00]  I haven't caught Nathaniel testing it before.  He was kind of slapping on his cheek and he said, that's the right consistency.  He's a good boy.  That kid's a go-getter, I'll tell you.  He certainly is.  And Stan knows how to make another man happy and I like him.  Before we take a break, I just want to bring up something.  Yeah.  I saw Napoleon Dynamite.  I enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite.  I, uh...  As a matter of fact, Danny had burnt me a disc and has been asking me to bring it back in. 
[00:24:30]  Really?  And it's sitting right next to my bed.  And I forget every day because I don't give that room any thought once I leave this building.  I don't even give a...  It's not even a passing thought through my head, the interns or anybody.  And then I come in and it hits me again.  I go, oh, Danny's disc.  That's right, Napoleon Dynamite.  I saw that movie yesterday.  Yeah.  And I, uh...  I don't know. 
[00:25:00]  I thought it was funny.  I don't know if I like it a lot or hate it.  I'm not really sure.  Yeah, it's...  I found it very funny.  And I think you have to watch it a few more times.  I'm doing movies on demand now.  So I got that movie for another 12 hours.  I'm going to watch it again.  Yeah.  I'm not really sure what I saw, though.  It's very funny.  I like the football jock guy.  From 1982.  That bought the...  Try to buy the time machine.  And go back to 1982.  And go back to his glory days.  Well, we all know someone like that. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  I went to Harborfields High School in Long Island.  And a lot of those football jocks.  Yeah.  That was the pinnacle of their lives.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Playing football on the high school team.  And after that, it never got better.  It never got any better than that for those guys.  And every once in a while, I'll go into some of the local bars.  And you'll still see some of these guys in there.  Wearing the jerseys.  Oh, yeah.  And their varsity jackets and stuff.  Wearing the rings.  And they're just still going over that big famous play that got them into the conference finals or whatever. 
[00:26:00]  And it's just like, dude, what have you been doing since then?  That is a frightening thought that nothing has happened.  This is Ricky the intern.  Ricky.  Yes.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I'm lost.  What do you mean you're lost?  Dude, Al Rekha told me to make a left out the building and then make a left at the corner.  Yeah.  And going down two blocks.  And then the deli going two blocks down.  Right.  Did he happen to mention the Starbucks that you were supposed to go to for me at quarter to six? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I was going to go to the Starbucks last just to keep your coffee fresh.  Because I'm going to go there first and then wait at the deli, you know?  So where are you now?  I'm still on six.  Forget the Starbucks.  I'm going to have somebody else go.  All right.  Now, wait.  Eric, is he near where he's got to be?  Ricky, you're on sixth and what?  And I was down on 58.  He's right there.  I was supposed to go north instead of south.  He told me he left.  Here's what you've got to do. 
[00:27:00]  Walk into the middle of the street, face away from traffic, and put your hands over your ears.  Wait, he's right around the corner?  He's right around the corner.  And he's lost?  It's across the street from where he's standing.  And now, you haven't been to the deli yet?  No, I haven't seen deli.  All right.  The blue awning, you said, right?  Yeah, it's right there.  Wait, you've been gone a half hour, and you're only, like, right around the corner. 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  I don't see.  I see the Manhattan Ocean Club.  Manhattan Ocean Club, Eric?  What?  I don't know where that is.  It's across from Jekyll and Hyde.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Go across the street and then up a little bit.  It's right there.  Have you seen Jekyll and Hyde's, the theme restaurant?  Yeah.  Are you in front of Jekyll and Hyde's?  No.  It's here for him turning around.  Go back to Jekyll and Hyde's.  Sex Bagel's running out to find the intern and bring him back home. 
[00:28:00]  If you knew, if anyone that doesn't know Manhattan knew how close he was to us right now, he is right around a corner.  Yeah.  You're right around the corner from us.  It's been a half hour.  Longer.  What are you doing?  Just walking around aimlessly?  Yeah, basically.  I thought, I made the left down to the block, and then I thought, okay, maybe I was supposed to leave at the right of the building.  It's the left of the building.  So then I went back up, and I didn't see the deli down there anyway. 
[00:28:30]  The weird part is, there's a deli on every corner.  Yeah, but I was told to go to a certain one.  All right.  Yes, Ben?  You hired this guy.  Well, I know.  All right, Ricky, we're coming to get you.  I have nothing to say.  You're going to rescue him?  Yeah, we're going to rescue Ricky the intern, so let's say hi to Doug in Colorado.  You're stupid!  Doug, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, speaking of Napoleon Dynamite, I think you guys need to find two Mexicans who can go pick up Ricky and bring him back. 
[00:29:00]  Punch it out.  All right, thank you.  Remember the two Mexicans that picked up Napoleon when he had to go to the girl's house?  Right.  Yeah, like I said, I don't know if I liked the movie or not.  I liked it.  I thought it was funny.  I thought it was weird.  He's one of those weird characters that everybody knew.  You didn't really know him in high school, but you saw him walk in the hallways.  That wacky mannerism and stuff.  I liked it.  I thought it was a little odd.  All right, very good. 
[00:29:30]  Well, why don't we take our first break?  Just getting warmed up here.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Uh-huh.  So, uh...  People are speculating he's on a crack run outside, buying crack.  What?  That's why he's been gone so long.  He's buying crack outside.  You think he's a crackhead?  No.  He's a nerd.  He is a nerd.  He's a nerd.  All right, well, why don't we take a break?  Derek, get us out of here.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:30:00]  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says...  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Ready?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness. 
[00:30:30]  Open up.  Y'all hate.  And then there's no one that makes.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  You mother, get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  You fuck out.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  And listen, suck it.  Yeah, I've been given the name.  All right, let's go right to the phones.  Eric is on the phone.  Sex Bagel.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I'm at Starbucks getting Jim's coffee right now.  Oh, thank you, Eric.  How lost was he?  He's standing there just looking into the street, right? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  So I go over.  I'm like, what happened?  He's like, I don't see any place called the Blue Awning.  I said, we didn't say that.  Ben said, we were eating from the new place, the Rock and Roll Deli.  I said, you can't miss it.  It has a blue awning.  Oh, my God.  He thought the name of the deli was the Blue Awning?  Yeah, and he was right near the deli where we get the food.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Literally right next to it.  He is really stupid.  Hey, Eric, you know that I just want a medium coffee with some skim milk, right? 
[00:31:30]  And one sugar, right?  Oh, thank you.  Did he actually remember that?  Yep.  I'll be up in one minute.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Bye.  Bye.  Is that him huffing and puffing as he's walking?  Yeah, I know.  It's not him.  I don't know what that is.  He's walking away from what school you are with a little blood on his fingers.  You might have to give, like, Ricky a black box or a GPS system or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Give him some kind of guidance system, a navigation system from a car to strap it to his head.  Well, they have the handheld GPSs now, too.  Uh-huh.  Which I think is kind of a waste of time when you're kind of walking. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, and I don't think he'd be able to work the thing very well.  If he thought the name of the place was the Blue Awning, go to the deli.  It's got the Blue Awning.  You know, the Blue Awning.  Well, I see a deli that has a Blue Awning, but it's not called the Blue Awning.  Jesus.  You know what?  We ought to give him a work boot to the spine.  Beat it, stupid.  Poor Ricky.  Have you seen the logo on the pinnacle whacked-out water bottles?  Yeah, it's my brother's WOW logo. 
[00:32:30]  It totally is the logo.  Yeah, they completely ripped it off.  Wow.  Completely.  The logo's up on whackbag.com and, I don't know, everywhere.  All the websites have it.  It's the sticker.  Yeah.  And they put it on the front of their bottles.  Yeah.  You guys do have that copywritten, right?  Yeah, my brother has it copywritten.  A little litigation there.  Yeah, well, it's kind of sad, too, because, you know, Pinnacle, they've been advertising  with the show off and on for years.  Yeah.  And they just blatantly take our logo and throw it on some brand-new water product they have. 
[00:33:00]  Mm-hmm.  Whacked-out water?  What?  What's wacky about it?  It's zanerific, I guess.  I don't know.  Whacked-out water.  It's a caffeine drink or something.  You know, when we were at WNEW, we had a lot of people pitching some ridiculous products  to us.  And there was a...  We would have to take these meetings upstairs before the show.  And remember the time the guy came in with his water product?  And basically, he was claiming that it could get more oxygen and... 
[00:33:30]  Oh, the oxygen water.  Into his water.  That fad.  But isn't water like H2O?  It's not H2O or H2O to the fourth power?  Yeah.  We were asking if it was a different chemical composition.  Yeah, because...  No.  What they do is like just aerate air through it.  They just pump air through the water, bottle it, and say it's oxygenated water.  Yeah.  What a scam that is.  Sell it for like 10 times the amount of regular water. 
[00:34:00]  You know what's good?  If you want oxygen and water, you take a sip of water, then you go...  There you go.  Yeah.  We couldn't understand this whole concept.  What do you breathe it in?  But I guess they did...  I don't know.  I guess they did advertise with our show.  Yeah.  There was a study done that showed that even if there was more oxygen in the water,  like they had saturated the water with oxygen,  that it really had no benefit when you ingest it by drinking it.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Oxygen really did nothing.  What a scam.  Oh, but there we were hawking it.  Oh, we hawked it, all right.  I remember hawking.  We hawked and hawked and hawked.  That's a good wreck.  Wow, there's the wreck of the morning, Northern State Parkway in Woodbury.  Looks like somebody flipped over their car and hit an overpass on the parkway.  Right.  Look, the lights are still on.  I bet that...  Is somebody still in there?  Probably.  That's like a brand new accident.  Probably someone's in there.  Yeah, because there's no emergency people on the scene yet.  Wow.  Wow, that's a crazy one. 
[00:35:00]  Anyway.  That's your accident of the day.  Might have been some black ice, Anthony.  Some black ice.  Oh, got to watch the black ice.  Speaking of black boxes, we were talking about Ricky and the GPS and all that.  I was watching TV the other night.  Have you heard about this new thing they got for concerned parents out there?  Some kind of black box you put in your vehicle?  Yeah.  So when your teenager's driving around, you could kind of keep tabs on them?  You could tell where they are? 
[00:35:30]  You could tell where they are.  You could get a whole readout of their ride to see when they were speeding and stuff.  Oh, it gives you all the vital stats of the car?  Oh, yeah, man.  How fast they're going?  Right on the website.  Wow.  You could go to the website and you could see where Junior is.  And then you punch a link or whatever and it shows you how fast he's going, how fast he has gone.  Oh, really?  So you could look at his whole night of being out and see how fast he was going, where he's been?  It's a whole graph.  It's like, wow, he was going over 80 miles an hour during this stretch of a highway. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  And then supposedly there's some kind of thing you could punch in to, you know, set off an alarm in the car to warn your child,  hey, I'm watching you and you're speeding, what are you doing?  And then I think it goes as far as shutting off the vehicle if you really want.  You could shut down the vehicle.  Shut down the vehicle from home while your teenager's driving around.  That is great.  Probably get a point where you could put a breathalyzer in there and that could go back so you could tell if they've been drinking. 
[00:36:30]  Wow.  Yeah, that's technology for you.  I know, that's a little creepy, but.  Creepy.  You know how helpful that would have been at one point in my life?  Shh, Jim, I know it looks like a girl, but it's not.  Over.  Thanks, Dad.  I have a camera in there.  Oh, Dad, thank you.  Tell him you want to smell his breath.  Get out of my vehicle, you androgynous imposter.  That's pretty good.  That's going to save the world of hurt.  That's pretty good.  Man, I know as a teen growing up, that would have been very detrimental to me having fun because it was all about drinking, driving, driving fast, being where you're not supposed to be, home late. 
[00:37:00]  Smashing mailboxes with bags.  Yeah, or just your car.  I used to just run the car into them.  Or you go to the supermarket parking lots and grab the shopping cart and wheel that thing up to about 60 miles an hour out the window as you're holding on and let go of it. 
[00:37:30]  Who knows what it's hitting?  Who cares?  Who cares?  You're young and crazy.  The old days.  Young and crazy.  Didn't have any of this computerized stuff to rat you out.  Right.  You're hanging out with two brothers and one says, because there's a man walking shirtless down a road in the afternoon, and one says, hey, Stanley, let's get some hot oil and throw it on him.  The guy wanted to leak motor oil out of the hot engine.  It was 90 degrees into a parquet dish, like a butter thing, and throw it on the guy with the shirt. 
[00:38:00]  Let's throw hot oil on him, Stanley.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  That's real thinking.  Steve on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I saw that same report about the little black box for the cars.  Yeah.  Apparently what makes the alarm go off is when you reach a certain G-force.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so if you turn too hard or you accelerate too fast or stop too fast, it sets the alarm off.  Really?  Yeah.  Tell me how that doesn't make people go crazy when they're driving. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  Punching out.  I would love to discuss it further, but I'm not good at G-force discussions.  Yeah, not at all.  I couldn't even tell you what a G-force is officially.  G-force.  I know it makes your face look all weird if you're in too many Gs.  I actually thought it was the place on the force that makes it come.  Eric from Colorado.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Eric?  Hey, that box you're talking about, one of the TV stations out here had a story last night that they have this for the cell phones now, where you can install it on your kid's cell phone and it will monitor it. 
[00:39:00]  And you can monitor them on your computer.  And if they're doing something wrong, you can call them.  Wait, how does it monitor the cell phone?  It's a special type of cell phone.  Yeah.  I only caught part of the story, but they were saying it's a special type of cell phone.  Yeah, I can tell where you are.  And it's everything your kid's doing at all times.  It can tell where you are.  Again, on a website or something. 
[00:39:30]  You can pop it up and see where your slut daughter is.  That's what it's made for.  Come on, let's be real.  It's not made for the guys that are going out.  It's the slut daughter.  Yeah, why is she making a phone call on her back?  What is she doing?  Where is she?  She's at that guy's house she's not supposed to be at.  Yeah, let's say hi to Matt in Nevada.  Cool.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, man.  Yeah, that black box, it's all part of the government scheme.  They're doing all types of little things like that with the kids' backpacks and cell phones and everything like that. 
[00:40:00]  In California, they want to make it a law that every car has a black box.  They're already coming off the assembly line with them.  We've talked about that before.  Yeah, so it's just another way to know what we're doing, when we're doing it, and why we're doing it.  Let me ask you a question.  I understand the big brother argument, and I don't want big brother looking at me,  but I am so sick of kids and parental nonsense.  I think it's great if parents want to monitor their kids, good.  Stop asking the rest of society to do it.  Like, if you can monitor your dumb, awful child from home, good. 
[00:40:30]  Why should the rest of us worry about it?  Yeah, that's true, but it goes deeper, and it's just going to get further and further into our personal life.  But here's the problem I have.  What you're giving is like a slippery slope argument, and does that, like, because something can be abused,  does that mean that it shouldn't be used?  It's like, technically, innocent people can go to jail.  The jail can be abused, so should we not have jail just because it can be used in an abusive way?  Well, I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying it's going to become so regular, and everyone's going to be okay with it, 
[00:41:00]  that when it comes down hard on all of us, I mean, it's just going to seem normal.  It doesn't really come down hard, though.  Yeah, what are they going to find out, to be very honest with you?  I mean, I'm not saying I want them in my life every two minutes.  What can they possibly find out?  They use them in court cases is what I was reading.  They take these black boxes, which are in cars, or a lot of General Motors cars have them in there already,  and if you have an accident and the airbag is deployed, they could look at how fast you were going,  when you stepped on the brakes, things like that, and it could be used in court if, you know, 
[00:41:30]  somebody wants to argue that the accident didn't take place like you're saying it did.  That's great.  Yeah, that's fine.  And with the kids, you know, if you're under 18 years of age, you don't have any rights anyway.  You're out in your car.  Your parents absolutely have a right to know exactly where you are at any given moment.  You know, that's just the way it is.  Once you get over that age, then it gets a little tricky as to who knows where you are at any given time.  That blows, though, dude.  When we were under 18, you know, you were sneaking out, doing the party thing. 
[00:42:00]  It blows.  You're right.  But sorry, the future's here.  If they got the technology, the parents can use them.  If they had that stuff when we were growing up, I'm sure, you know, people would have been pissed at it.  But that's life.  Right.  You're going to have flying cars, but you won't be able to bang at them.  Why?  Because your stupid parents are looking at you.  We're never going to have flying cars.  We'll never have a flying car.  Not in our lifetime.  Probably not.  The stupid flying car.  They've been talking about that.  I've been reading popular mechanics and popular science for years, and they always have the cover picture.  The flying car. 
[00:42:30]  And you go through it.  You look how cool it would be.  Never going to happen.  What if they just admit we're never going to have a flying car?  People can't drive regular cars.  How the hell are they going to organize flying cars in the air?  I've actually read something about that.  And one thing would be that your windshield or whatever, there'd be a computer readout,  and it would kind of print out lines in front of you, and you just kind of follow them on your computer.  Follow them.  People can't work in two dimensions on the street.  Right.  And they're going to start working in three dimensions.  It might be automated, I'm saying.  It might be automated.  Automated.  There's just not going to be flying cars ever. 
[00:43:00]  You know how many people hit other people just going straight, forward, backward, side to side?  Imagine up and down.  Imagine you're flying your flying car, and some old asshole is coming up.  It just bangs into the bottom of your car.  Your flying car hits the unit that's keeping you in the air.  Right.  Mechanical problems.  You ever see that car on the side of the road as you're driving home and go,  I wonder what happened to that guy?  That would just be a flaming wreckage on the street because you'd fall out of the sky. 
[00:43:30]  Just thousands and thousands of commuters coming from Long Island to Manhattan in their flying cars.  Yeah, that'll work.  That'll work.  Doing donuts in the flight path of the runways of airports.  Some kid in his flying car.  Flying car would be the most dangerous thing ever, ever, ever.  Flying car, indeed.  I understand they have a flying car they're working on, but it works only like a Ted Kennedy model  where it goes ten feet and then just falls into the water. 
[00:44:00]  Wow, this is great.  No, it's not.  Could you imagine Ricky in a flying car?  See?  You've got to realize, it's not Einstein's driving around in these flying cars.  You know, not everybody is going to have a flying car and be like,  you know, okay, I should be home soon.  You know, my vector is home.  I'm in the other, our home runway.  And it's going to be, what?  What does this button do?  It'll fall out of the sky on top of me.  Great.  Thank you. 
[00:44:30]  There's a reason there's not a flying car.  I'm sure they have the technology somewhere for a flying car.  I don't want to see it.  But wouldn't a flying car be called an airplane?  No.  No?  From what I've seen, it doesn't look like it's based on wings with air moving.  It's some type of levitation device.  All right.  Like a Harrier jet.  Right.  And I've seen these models and mock-ups.  Do you see the one with the four engines on it that tilt like a Harrier?  And it lifts you up and lets you go.  And the guy that built this thing has one, and he won't fly it because he doesn't want 
[00:45:00]  to wreck it.  Because he's only got one.  That tells you something right there.  He built it.  Picture going into a showroom, some old idiot.  Yeah, I'll take one.  Oh.  No thank you.  I'd love to have a flying car.  All right.  Let's say hi.  Who wouldn't peek in the windows?  Let's say hi to David in Orlando.  David.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  We're picking up flying trainees.  How you doing, daddy? 
[00:45:30]  18,000 feet.  David, go ahead.  Every cell phone in the last two years has GPS on it.  These fucking idiots think it's new technology.  Every cell phone has that shit.  It doesn't have GPS.  Yes, it does.  No, it doesn't.  They can kind of tell where.  They can kind of tell.  Every phone mobile has put out in the last two years by national law.  It's not GPS, you idiot.  What is it, then?  Okay, I'm an idiot.  It tracks where you are based on the cell towers that are around you. 
[00:46:00]  You can kind of see where you are, but not to the accuracy that GPS has.  Every phone has GPS.  He's still talking.  You idiot!  Shut up, you fucking buffoon.  Hey, guys.  I hate you.  You're a misinformed jack-off.  Yes.  I do have a funny story.  All right.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me buckle in.  Let's all strap in for David's funny story.  Oh.  Birthday boy, you ready for a funny story?  All set.  He hung up. 
[00:46:30]  Of course he did.  What an ass.  For years, you have been able to kind of zero in on certain phones where you are based on the cell towers.  But it's not like GPS.  Every phone has GPS.  Indeed.  And everyone has a flying car.  By the national law, they have to.  They have to.  Yeah, quoting more laws.  We were talking about that last week.  Everyone with their laws.  No, it's a law.  Shut up.  Ryan in New Hampshire.  What's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good. 
[00:47:00]  Excellent.  Hey, I know Nextel has that tracking stuff because my company uses it to track us.  So you've got to shut the phone off if you want to go take a nap somewhere for a while.  Yeah, that's creepy.  Workplaces tracking you.  They have the GPS in the cars.  A lot of the car rental agencies, too.  When you're driving that, they could fine you for speeding.  It's in the contract.  They know how fast you're going, and if they find out you were speeding, they can fine you. 
[00:47:30]  It's amazing.  You guys were talking about the black boxes.  We had a teenager that got into a big accident up here, killed a kid or two, and the local  police pulled the black box out of the Jeep, and they're going to use the information from  that as to whether or not they charged this kid with murder.  Yeah.  And most people don't even know it's in their cars.  I drive fast, but technically, if they can use something that can keep you from breaking  the law, and I know I sound like a real goody-two-shoes Republican. 
[00:48:00]  I don't mean it like that, but legally, the argument, how are you going to make the argument?  I have the right to speed if you don't catch me.  It's hard to find legal basis to make that argument on it, I think.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Hey, Jimmy, I know tickets are selling out real quick for your stint up here in Boston  in a couple of weeks, so...  Oh, April 8-9, yeah, the connection.  What's that, buddy?  Hoping to get down to see you in Boston.  Okay, thank you.  I know tickets are going real fast.  Yeah, get tickets right away, because Jim Norton's show at the Bogota sold in four hours 
[00:48:30]  or something like that?  Yeah, it went in like four hours.  It's a sold-out show for the Bogota.  Yeah, April 16th.  All right, thank you.  All right, guys, punch it out.  Thanks, Angel.  All right, Ricky's back in studio.  Why is he just standing here?  Because he got lost going to the microphone.  You all right, Ray?  No, I just once again screwed up.  Oh, oh.  Feeling a little bad about yourself?  You okay?  It's just...  I don't know.  Today I came in, you know, thinking I was going to get everything right. 
[00:49:00]  I had everybody orders down and everything, and then...  Something just keeps happening, doesn't it?  You can't even look at us.  I know.  I'm just too ashamed to look at y'all right now.  Oh, he's too ashamed.  Don't be ashamed.  It's not a sexual issue.  It's not like we walked in and caught you blowing Ben.  Again?  Yeah.  Exactly.  We understand you had to get the gig.  It's all forgotten.  Oh, my.  You're not going to cry, are you?  You are really upset about this.  Looks like you might cry, Anthony. 
[00:49:30]  It'll be all right.  Cry, cry, cry, cry.  You're going to squirt?  You're going to squirt?  Wow.  It's okay, I guess.  Yeah, it's all right.  I got my coffee finally.  Don't worry about it.  Why do you think it happened this time?  You see, instead of just being ashamed, you've got to assess the situation and kind of say,  why did this happen this time?  So you don't make that mistake again.  So assess the situation.  What happened?  I thought the name of the deli was actually the Blue Awning.  The Blue Awning. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  So when you saw a deli that had a Blue Awning but a different name, that confused you.  Yeah.  No, I thought it, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you right now thinking, my God, was that a stupid thing to do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some people in the other room with their heads in their hands.  Poor Rick, I feel bad because a lot of times he's walking around,  and he's probably like, I'm not going to call in.  I'm going to do it this time.  I'm going to find it.  I'm going to make it through. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Did you notice a lot of time was going by and you were probably thinking to yourself,  uh-oh.  Yeah.  They've got to be talking about where I am.  Yeah.  I'm like looking at it and I'm like, oh, crap.  Yeah.  Got a little shaken up inside, a little more nerves,  and kind of threw you for a loop a little more.  You're kind of stupid.  That's not true, Opie.  Jesus, Opie.  He's kind of stupid, though.  No, he isn't.  He is.  There are certain things that happen that put you in situations that perhaps, you know,  he just didn't pick up on right away.  He's not you at directions.  Some people are not you at directions.  Some people aren't. 
[00:51:00]  No, I mean, it was in the right direction.  It just didn't see the rest of it.  Dude, all he had to do was take one left and then another left.  Yeah.  Left, left.  Trying to stick up for you.  Left, left.  Knock down his argument.  Jesus.  Left, left, and then look for a blue awning.  That was all he had to do.  I would have to say you're a little slow.  Oof.  Jesus.  Just a little.  I'd say that.  That's not accurate.  He's a good guy.  All right, Ricky.  Wow.  Okay.  We look forward to your next mess up, I guess. 
[00:51:30]  Makes for good radio.  He shouldn't.  Well.  There he goes.  If I was somebody right now, I would open a place up called the Blue Awning.  That's right.  You know, so that way if anyone else gets confused, you get their overflow business.  I want to see him dejected.  Sorry.  Too late.  That is one upset individual.  He is really, really down on himself about that screw-up.  Right.  Because we have such a group of go-getters that can just, like, they're Johnny on the 
[00:52:00]  spots.  You know?  You give them a little mission, they do it.  It's not a problem.  And he's had a couple of problems.  This isn't the first time this has happened.  This goes back to childhood and the times where, like, he would just be kind of sitting  there in the woods by himself, like, kind of like Henry Fonda in on Golden Pond, when  he went to pick strawberries or blueberries.  Looking at the loom.  I got lost.  Poor old codger.  Don't be old man hat. 
[00:52:30]  With his, yeah, his fishing hat.  And he can't even get a rod to molest the blonde boy that's been spending the summer with  him, he takes him out on the old boat.  Oh, my goodness.  That's another one of those movies that just makes me laugh really hard when I see it.  When he starts looking around and he realizes he's lost.  Up at the trees, they're so tall and scary.  Yeah, so confusing.  That must have been when it looked like blue awnings and buildings spinning around.  I thought it was the blue awning. 
[00:53:00]  I was lost.  I saw that in the movies when I was 13.  I mean, my friend Robert Levinson and his mom, I wanted to go see this 3D Parasite movie,  but they made me go see it on a golden pond, which I actually really loved, though.  You did?  It's one of my favorite movies.  Did you love it then?  Why?  I was surprised.  I liked it.  Why do you like the movie so?  He's well acted.  I mean, come on, Fonda and Hepburn, it was brilliant.  One of the worst replacement movies ever for me.  I went to go see Alien in the movie theater, and it was full, so I had to go see Battlestar Galactica 
[00:53:30]  in the movie theater.  What a trade-off.  Oof.  My dad, I wanted to go see My Bodyguard, and I forget what black and white Woody Allen film  he took me to, which I may enjoy now that I'm 36.  But, you know.  Yeah, as a kid.  Yeah, as soon as you can smell her breath.  Thanks, Dad.  It smells like lollipops.  She's 3.  Yeah, kids, they're not really going for the Woody Allen movies. 
[00:54:00]  I was not.  It was a bad one, too.  It might have been Stardust Memories, if someone could correct me.  I think that may have been it.  Jesus.  And it was so bad.  I was so disappointed.  My dad actually took me to see, like, the second half of My Bodyguard at another theater.  You sure it wasn't, like, Zellig?  No, no, no.  I think this was, like, way before Zellig.  Oh, way before Zellig.  Yeah, I was probably 13 or 14.  I went to go see Saturday Night Fever in the theater with my mom and my grandmother.  And I was sitting right between the two of them. 
[00:54:30]  Talk about the most embarrassing movie moment ever.  When, what's-her-face there, Annette is getting gang-banged in the backseat of that car.  Oh, my God.  You happy now?  You're a cunt.  And I'm sitting there, and my grandma is right next to me.  Whoa.  Oh, I was sweating profusely.  Sweating.  Like, I just, I was embarrassed for two hours straight.  Just horrible. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, that's, yeah.  Oh, it's bringing it all back.  Sitting there, totally red, beat red.  Grandma on the left.  Mommy on the right.  Just watching the dead get gang-banged by John Travolta's buddies on the Verrazano Bridge.  Why didn't you call me, Tony?  Why didn't you call me?  I don't know what's more embarrassing.  That or the fact that I walked into the movie theater with the same platform shoes that lucid 
[00:55:30]  fell off the bridge was wearing.  When you come to me on a summer breeze, keep me warm in your life.  Thank you, son.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Grandma, you ever get banged like that in a bottle of tea?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We got out of the dancing place with the condom in our hands, just yearning for John Travolta's 
[00:56:00]  hog.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  I'd almost forgotten that moment in life.  It's really a nice place you have.  It's a rock high.  Puerto Ricans.  Take off your cell.  Yeah.  Take off your cell.  Annette, cigarette? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Do we have to listen anymore?  Bend over.  Bend over.  What is this?  What is that from?  Bend, breathe in one way. 
[00:57:00]  It's a snake.  Nigga, fuck me.  I can't do that.  Say, me, God.  Hey, God.  Fuck me hard.  Fuck me hard. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, God.  Fuck me hard.  Peter, fuck me hard.  Again.  Nigga, fuck me hard.  Nigga, fuck me hard.  Nigga, fuck me hard.  Nigga, fuck me hard.  Nigga, fuck me hard.  Nigga, fuck me hard.  Wow.  I don't think that was from Saturday Night Fever, but... 
[00:58:00]  That's exactly what that GPS in the car is for.  Prevent awful...  Oh, of course.  ...against the Bible moments like that.  You sure don't want to hit the auto-dial for your parents on that one, right?  What is that?  My little girl's phone?  Let me answer this.  Oh, then you've got to hear that.  All right, well.  And the funny thing is, sometimes you hear your friend say something.  I had a similar problem.  Like when you said I was sitting between my mother and my grandmother, I'm like, oh, my God, I had the same problem.  Which finger do you smell first? 
[00:58:30]  We have a clip from what, Eric?  From Saturday Night Fever?  All right, Derek's got a clip for us, Anthony.  Come on, get away!  You're such a fucking cock-teaser, you know that?  You're fucking calling me a goddamn cock-teaser!  You are a cock-teaser.  Why are you hanging around with me?  Dancing, that's why.  Oh, dancing, huh?  Dancing.  Down to disco.  Hey, Annette, I don't want to be your dancing partner no more.  What a buffoon, Tony Manero. 
[00:59:00]  It was the guy.  Yeah, that dialogue, and I'm sitting next to my grandmother.  That was awful.  Talking about cocks.  Oh.  Hey, Grandma.  Remember Grandpa's cock?  What do you say?  Horrible.  Did the guy who killed himself for that, whatever his name was, did he play Ralph Garci in Fame?  Is it the same guy I'm thinking of?  Ah, same type.  I'm not sure if it was him.  I know he was in the movie.  I don't know if it was the same guy.  You didn't even call me, Tony.  No, come on down from here. 
[00:59:30]  Why did he kill himself?  I don't remember.  He didn't really kill himself.  He fell?  He kind of fell.  Yeah, he fell off the bridge.  Yeah, he was...  Like...  Yeah, he was trying to be cool like the rest of the guys.  He was cool, and he was stoned and drunk or whatever.  Playing grab-ass with each other on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge and jumping around and doing handstands.  He was trying to be cool with his big platform shoes.  And he was like, Tony, I'm dancing.  I'm dancing, Tony.  And he fell off the bridge.  Yeah, he fell.  And it was real...  A lot of sorrow there.  And Tony Manera gets over it in like 15 minutes. 
[01:00:00]  Let's go to the cigars and scotch.  Oh!  Hey, they call me.  My name's Ricky.  I'm wet.  It's cold like Brazil.  I'm at the blue awning.  I'm at the blue awning now.  I'm gonna cross the street.  Where is the bagel place?  Jim hates coffee.  Jim doesn't want coffee.  I'm gonna cross the street now. 
[01:00:30]  We might as well play it.  I'm a little rascal.  I'm a little rascal.  He was really...  Because of this prank call, whenever anyone around here needs coffee, we just go, Bill  needs coffee.  Bill needs coffee.  Yeah, we can play this as we go to break.  Yeah, right.  Oh, crap.  What are you doing, Opie?  Oh, boy.  I just gotta load it in over here.  There you are.  My name's Judy.  What's yours?  I love this.  See?  I told ya.  I love this clip. 
[01:01:00]  I really love this.  When we come back, Anthony, the author of the following email will be on our show.  The email reads, I am sorry, but I think I'm still bisexual.  I must admit, I do like it up the ass.  I even have a strap-on.  Now to find a chick to use it on me.  We will be talking to that person next.  How many are you going to read the email?  Cut it out, Ant.  Stop it.  All right, but first. 
[01:01:30]  All-time associate, can I help you?  Hello?  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  You're lost?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There is.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's the 8th. 
[01:02:00]  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No, do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  I'm wet.  I believe I need a changing.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a changing and my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number?  I'm going to walk across the street now.  No, stay on the phone.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  Sounds a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't 
[01:03:00]  talk to you.  Oh, hey, hey, Bill.  Hey, hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a coat and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Here I go.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him.  Well, he's doing good.  He's still here.  He's glad.  He probably will tip on the phone.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down and walked.  He dropped the phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh, my God.  Somebody call an ambulance. 
[01:04:00]  I told you.  Oh, this is horrible.  My God.  He looks awful.  Jesus.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  The man got hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are.  It's too late.  It's too late.  There's this bad spirit all over the road. 
[01:04:30]  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late unless you got a shovel.  All right.  We'll get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late.  You can't help anymore.  Just bring a shovel.  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland.  In Disneyland.  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Pirates of the Caribbean.  And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  A pirate's life for me. 
[01:05:00]  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter.  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter.  23 Jupiter.  Okay, do you live there? 
[01:05:30]  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab.  Send a cab.  You're telling them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter, 28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Oh, I see.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem? 
[01:06:00]  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this? 
[01:06:30]  Wow, that's really nice.  What's going on against the wall?  I'm not a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  M202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Word up.  Everybody say.  When you hear the call, you're about to get it underway. 
[01:07:00]  Word up.  It's the cold words.  No matter what you say it, you know that's overworked.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Get ready for spring.  Get your WOW stickers now, people.  Unless you live in a nice warm climate, then you're enjoying the benefits of WOW.  But send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City.  We'll get you a WOW sticker.  The address is on our website, opianthony.com. 
[01:07:30]  Yes, Anthony.  Has Ricky jumped off the Verrazano fridge yet?  Nah, I walked out there and calmed him down a little bit.  You did?  Yeah.  Weren't you the one saying?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should have called me, Than.  I calmed him down a little bit.  You should have called me.  He's very sad.  I'm like, dude, relax.  Just enjoy yourself here.  You have fun.  You're going nowhere in the business, but at least you should enjoy your time here.  She loves the taste of communion wafers.  Father.  Father.  Anyway.  I'm not a father anymore. 
[01:08:00]  So what's going on with this guy?  What's his name?  Shannon Burke.  Shannon Burke.  I've never heard that name on a man, but I'm sure it's all right.  He's out of Orlando.  And XM, I guess, has booted him off.  And he's like blaming O&A.  Yeah.  How are we involved with this guy?  Well, the latest news on us, we're getting off the premium channel, which is huge, huge  news for the Open Entity program.  We never wanted to be on the premium channel, but we knew XM was the place to be. 
[01:08:30]  And we chose to accept what XM was going to give us, which was our show on a premium channel.  We knew in the long run we'd be off of it.  Yeah.  It was kind of like we had to do our time and prove to people that we weren't these, quote,  shock jocks that the media likes to make us out to be.  We're not making any trouble.  So we did our time knowing all along that eventually they would probably take us off this premium channel.  Right.  As far as being on the premium channel, because a lot of people are trying to spin it all sorts 
[01:09:00]  of ways out there in the media, we did very, very well on the premium channel.  Well, extremely well.  We did twice the numbers that XM wanted us to do, matter of fact.  Yeah.  They had their little plan.  I remember when we first started meeting with them, they had all kinds of studies and research  done and estimates of how many people would sign up, and we broke those.  We doubled it.  Simple as that.  We doubled it. 
[01:09:30]  By the end of the year, they wanted a certain amount that we're not even allowed to mention  on the air for whatever reason.  I don't know if it has something to do with the stock or what.  I don't know.  But there's a number that they wanted us to do.  We doubled it.  I swear to God, we doubled it.  So we did much better than anyone expected down there in Washington.  So now they want to take it to the next level, and that's to get us off the premium channel,  have us exposed to the entire XM Nation.  Of course, not everyone on the XM Nation is going to listen to the program, but we're going  to gain a lot of listeners because now we'll just be available while you're just spinning 
[01:10:00]  around your unit there, right?  Right.  And then what happens is a bunch of those people are going to get hooked.  That's why we call it Spread the Virus.  It kind of just is this thing that happens.  All of a sudden, you get hooked on the show, and then what do you do if it's normal listening  patterns?  You turn your friends on to it.  You're like, oh my God, you've got to hear these guys.  I've never heard of them before, but they're on XM.  They're Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And then guess what?  Those people, if they don't have XM, will go out and buy XM because now they're curious. 
[01:10:30]  Simple as that.  And that's how this show has always worked, and it's going to be huge again.  We know that.  We know that.  So it's huge news that we're getting off the premium.  But assholes out there like to spin it another way.  And what makes me want to spit in somebody's face like this, because what's so annoying  is they know better.  It's like when you're taking off the premium channel, that's XM's way of going, all right,  you two are not going to self-destruct.  Because again, they were afraid that there's going to be all this shit that caused you to  self-destruct.  You're not going to self-destruct.  You're kind of one of the staple shows of the entire network. 
[01:11:00]  How can anybody think that's negative?  What do you think XM's going to make more money on?  Two bucks a month?  Well, by raising everything and having a certain advertising possibly, you fucking idiot, and  you know better.  You local yokel.  Fucking one market wonder.  So this guy in Orlando, Shannon Burke, I guess he was hurt on XM, and they're taking him  off XM because, quite frankly, there's not enough room.  You know, XM only has a certain amount of channels.  So they got rid of Liquid Metal, unfortunately, which was a great station, but they had no 
[01:11:30]  choice, you know, because they just don't have room for everything they want to throw  on the service.  And they look at the channels that if they have to replace something, if they're putting  in a new show, they look at the channels.  And what do you think they do?  Do they take a channel that's really popular and eliminate that to add something new?  Or do they take a channel that maybe not that many people are listening to and take  it off?  I would tend to think it's the latter.  I think they do their research, find out, you know, they're not going to take the 80s 
[01:12:00]  station off the air and put something on there because a lot of people listen to it.  But someone like Shannon Burke's show is completely expendable because no one was listening to this.  This is the first I've ever, ever heard of this guy.  And it's not that old radio gag where you say you never heard of the guy.  I've never heard of this guy.  And that's why he's being dumped, because they have to make room for other people that  have bigger names in the business. 
[01:12:30]  That's just almost everybody.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  And as far as us being failures, because I think he says that either on his show or in  an email or something.  Professionally or in life?  Huh?  Well, I'm a failure in my personal life.  I openly admit that.  But as far as a radio guy, I've done quite well.  And we'll continue doing quite well.  And we'll be here.  Here's a little fact for Shannon and everyone else out there. 
[01:13:00]  If we're such a disaster, XM has the choice to get rid of us in about three or four months.  So we'll just see what happens, Shannon, if we're really a failure.  Or if they're going to pick up the rest of our contract, okay?  We'll just have to wait and see on that.  Won't we?  Won't we?  So here's Shannon talking on his show.  He's all depressed because XM is just getting rid of him.  They're booting him.  He's fattening and trimming him.  Bye.  Here's Ray in Virginia.  Ray, how you doing?  Hey, how you doing, Shannon?  What's happening, brother?  Hey, first-time caller.  I got up about six months ago. 
[01:13:30]  I was in Florida.  I heard you guys about the XM.  Excellent.  Okay, Chris, last year I bought 10 trucks.  I bought each one an XM radio.  Now, I heard yesterday you guys after the 28th.  You guys not going to be there anymore?  Yeah, you'll be entertained by the fabulous Tony Kornheimer, whatever his name is.  And it's Kornheimer Sports Show or something like that, and then the great G. Gordon Libby.  All right, let me stop right there. 
[01:14:00]  Tony and G. Gordon Libby are two radio personalities that have a much bigger following than Shannon Burke,  and that's why this is happening, Shannon.  Shannon Burke.  If you had an audience, you'd still be there.  They would have taken off a show that had less of an audience than you did.  It's just the way it works.  No one was listening to you.  Jack off.  How embarrassing is that, though, to be on XM and then just to have a couple of new guys come along, 
[01:14:30]  and they just kind of kick you off.  Beat it, stupid.  Well, they have bigger followings.  That's how it works in the business, and that's how it's going to continue to work.  And when we get off the premium, I think we're even going to expand our channel.  It's not going to be us all day long.  I think we're going to try to do some other things in some of the other time slots.  Oh, maybe Shannon can come on.  No, no, Shannon's not on our list, unfortunately, no.  Shannon.  There's a whole list of people we want to be involved in this channel.  What about Shannon?  That have a much bigger following than Shannon. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know about that.  Shannon's a self-important loser who thinks he's got a lot more listeners than he does.  Yeah.  Yeah, after Thursday, I called customer service, and I told them to cancel my service.  I got one more month with them.  I got 10 gradios working on 10 big trucks, 18 wheelers.  Yeah.  So after next month, if you guys don't come out anymore, I got 10 radios that are going  to be canceled.  All right, let me tell you something about radio.  You know, Anthony and I have a huge, faithful audience. 
[01:15:30]  The reality is this guy will continue listening to XM Satellite Radio.  Of course he will.  Of course he will.  Continue listening to XM Satellite Radio.  Cancel my 10 radios.  Yeah, he's going to go out and cancel his 10 radios because he can't hear the Shannon  Burke show anymore.  The Shannon Burke show.  And then he's going to do what?  Eat the actual physical units?  What are you going to do?  Just look at them in the truck like dinosaurs?  They're not going to work anymore, you asshole.  You're not canceling XM.  Of course you're not.  And if you do, who cares?  Drunk drive into a pole.  Yeah.  Nobody cares about you and your shitty fleet of trucks. 
[01:16:00]  The guy's being very dramatic, but the reality is he's not going to be canceling because  one show is being kicked off the service.  What a tool.  I'll hit them in their pocketbooks, Shannon.  Right.  You know how many people listen to us, but they also listen to a bunch of other things  on XM Satellite Radio.  So if we were gone, I think it would take us being gone and then maybe three or four  of their favorite other channels to be gone, and then they would finally go, you know what?  Hey, this isn't what I got. 
[01:16:30]  It's not the same as when I got to XM to begin with.  So I'm going to cancel.  You'd still listen.  You'd still listen.  We're not that important.  One show is not that important.  I don't know about that.  Well, Shannon Burke is, obviously.  He's important.  999.  Oh, sorry.  He's so important that he was completely expendable and thrown off the platform.  Come on.  That's about $1,200 a year.  Well, I appreciate that, man.  Thank you, Rad.  And thanks for the support, man.  All we can do is just call XM, be nice to them, and there's a chance they might move 
[01:17:00]  us somewhere else.  That'll work.  Yeah, I tried that for about two weeks, but after I heard that yesterday, I just wanted  to call in and see if the other drivers wanted to do something like that.  And here's the deal.  I think at this point, I've heard enough people say it.  I think it's the deal is they have another service available during the time this show  is on, and it's a premium channel that a couple other guys are on.  Now he's talking about yours truly.  Open it.  Here comes the bitter.  Can I just say that I do hope Eric Logan is listening, because if you are, man, I just 
[01:17:30]  want you to be careful, because this guy has got a trucker with 10 trucks who might be canceling  the service.  You may want to reconsider, because I know it sounds like Shannon Burke is groveling and  begging and saying, call customer service and be nice to them, and maybe they'll put us  somewhere else.  Gee whiz.  They are putting you somewhere else, off the platform.  Back in Orlando, motherfucker.  That's where they're putting you.  Back in the one market you started in.  Yeah, it's good to be big in one market.  Sure it is. 
[01:18:00]  Nothing wrong with that.  Sure.  But you pretty much failed on a national platform, and that's why you're gone.  Bet your face for reality.  Very popular at the Magic home games, aren't you, stupid?  That's the guy from the Shannon Burke show.  Who?  I talk to my radio voice, and I'm on a national platform.  Call them, beg, grovel, and say please and threaten to cancel yourself.  Ladies and gentlemen, before we start the Orlando Magic basketball game, let's hear for  Shannon Burke as he throws some t-shirts out into the audience.  People are looking around going, who's she?  Shannon?  Who? 
[01:18:30]  What?  Shannon Burke?  That chick?  All right, well, he starts talking about us and this premium channel.  The deal is they have another service available during the time this show is on, and it's  a premium channel that a couple other guys are on, and nobody's signing up for it because  they're just too entertained by this show.  All right, listen, all right, okay, that's really good.  I'm sick of people, you know, you want to attack us, that's fine, but why don't you,  you know, base it on some form of reality? 
[01:19:00]  The reality is, and if you do work for XM Satellite Radio, Shannon, or did, I think you're  finally gone, you would know that the channel has been very, very successful for the company,  you asshole.  He knows that, dude.  His bottom line is, he's getting the boot, he's begging his listeners, and the bottom  line is this, you have to explain, if you catch your wife sleeping with somebody  else, you have to explain why she's doing that, you can't just go, I'm a failure in  bed.  Right.  So you have to blame her, well, she wanted the guy with the bigger dick, you can't say  that, so you have to make an excuse.  Here's the bottom line, you know the deal's stupid, no one cares about your show, and 
[01:19:30]  sorry, you failed.  I like how he's trying to say that we don't have listeners because they're all listening  to him.  Is that what, that's what he was saying.  Oh, really?  Yeah, listen, he's actually saying that we are failing here because he's got,  so many listeners, they're so entertained by him that they're not coming over to us.  This is that self-important ass who is being kicked off, he's been kicked off because he 
[01:20:00]  doesn't have listeners.  I think at this point, I've heard enough people say it, I think the deal is they have another  service available during the time this show is on, and it's a premium channel that a couple  other guys are on, and nobody's signing up for it because they're just too entertained  by this show, so what they think they're doing...  Too entertained by this show.  Wait, so they're not signing up for Opie and Anthony because they're too entertained  by him.  Yeah.  So what they want to do is get rid of him, and then people will sign up for you, but 
[01:20:30]  then they take you off the premium channel, so even by getting rid of him, no one's going  to sign up.  What the fuck are you talking about, stupid?  Do you understand this is why they're kicking you off?  Because you stink.  You don't know what you're talking about.  This is why Anthony and I do not hang out with other radio guys, because they're all  full of shit.  They're all like this.  They're all like Shannon Burke.  Except for like Scott Farrell and Ron and Fez, and honestly, Sean Hannity has been a stand-up  guy through our whole career.  But Shannon Burke.  Don Imus has been cool to us, you know? 
[01:21:00]  But in general, these guys are all just full of themselves.  There's a premium service that everyone is avoiding because they're enjoying my show,  so they're going to take me off, and then cancel premium service, and then cancel.  So what they're doing is they're losing premium service revenue.  They're keeping you two losers, and they're kicking off this hot commodity.  Smart move by XM.  What a jizz bucket.  And this guy is just begging for his job.  Please be respectful when contacting XM.  Remember, we're trying to stay on XM.  What was it?  Shannon Burke.  Does anyone know his website? 
[01:21:30]  We'll give you a plug, Shannon.  The biggest plug you've ever gotten, you'll get right now.  Do you know his plug, Hawk?  Shannon.wtks.com.  Wait, Shannon.wtks.com.  Dot com.  And maybe listeners can email Shannon and be supportive of his plight.  Be respectful when you go on the website.  Remember, he's a tool.  Army attack.  Anthony, the rest of his little commentary.  By this show.  So, what I think they're doing is trying to bore the crap out of you with every other talk programming on XM. 
[01:22:00]  They're going to pay the premium money to get the premium channel.  So...  Yeah, but the guys are all washed up.  I used to hear them when I used to go to New York.  They are.  They are.  They are.  Next time I missed the boat with them.  But, hey.  I appreciate the support, Ray, and hopefully you'll hear us again.  So, the guy...  Wait.  We're washed up?  We're employed here at XM.  Yeah.  Under contract.  Doing very well.  You're fired from XM.  But we're washed up.  We're washed up.  Did you read the email he got? 
[01:22:30]  What was this guy?  Red Sox fan from Wack Bag or something?  Yeah.  I guess sent Shannon an email.  It probably wasn't pleasant, but the response he got...  Do you have it?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  This is Shannon's email reply.  Email reply.  You sound like...  And he can't write, I guess.  You sound like whiny little pussy.  Man up, you little crybaby.  I bet he says it on a show a lot.  He's like a biker.  Come on.  Man up.  Man up.  That's probably like one of his catchphrases.  Man up.  And the Democrats said, man up, Democrats. 
[01:23:00]  Man up.  Everyone claps because it's a catchphrase.  I hear he's like a real conservative.  He's probably one of those brass tax guys.  He's meat and potatoes.  Yes.  Man up, you little crybaby.  Email me back when you have the number one rated show in any market.  Yeah, because everybody that emails him should have a radio show.  I guess he's number one in Orlando.  That's pretty impressive.  Is he?  Is he?  I don't know.  I don't know if he is, but I do think that at the Orlando Magic game, it must be, like 
[01:23:30]  Ope said, fantastic.  Ladies and gentlemen, Shannon Burke.  O and A are shitty.  X are shitty XM failures who can't bring enough subs for a premium channel.  Hold on to your hats.  Don't be an asshole.  Dopey and asshole. 
[01:24:00]  I swear his originality ought to get him rehired.  I've never heard that.  I've got to say, because Ope rhymes with dopey, and asshole and Anthony both start with A.  Start with an A.  SB, that's Shannon Burke.  That also stands for stop begging.  You're thrown off, motherfucker.  Take the link off your website.  Yeah, like it always works when you beg to get your job back and try to get your listeners  to email the station. 
[01:24:30]  That trick always works, doesn't it?  It's a desperate move from a loser.  We didn't fail as a premium channel.  He knows that.  You know, there's another thing that was brought into consideration here as far as the direction  of our show, when Howard signed with Sirius, hello, XM had to rethink things, don't you  think?  You idiot.  And this was XM, I think, my opinion is it was XM's way of saying, yes, you guys are  the counterbalance to that move. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, that's a real insult.  That's a real failure.  Yeah.  Dope.  Shannon Burke.  Dopey and asshole.  Do not have hardly any audience anymore.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you're in New York.  I mean, so what?  You're on in L.A. and D.C. and Philadelphia.  I should just say every market in the entire country.  Yeah.  But you don't have Orlando in the palm of your hand like he does.  By the way, I was never nationally syndicated, you idiot.  I was simulcast on XM.  That's not syndication.  But I wouldn't expect an O&A moron like you to understand. 
[01:25:30]  Your pal.  Ha ha, he signs it.  Your pal.  Oh, he's crazy.  But the funny thing is, is he's really mad at the guy for writing the email and assuming  that he was once successful.  I was never nationally syndicated, you idiot.  I've always been a one market zero.  No.  I've always been a failure.  Ray will explain yourself.  God damn it, I've never had the talent to be interesting in more than one market, and  apparently not even one.  Ah.  Uh, dope.  Premium channel.  Yeah, but the other guys are all washed up.  I used to hear them when I used to go to New York. 
[01:26:00]  They are.  They are.  Yeah.  Makes me miss the boat with them.  But hey, I appreciate the support, Ray, and hopefully you'll hear us again.  Um, and he has a link on his website, or at least he had it, um, with emails to XM, and  it says, please be respectful when contacting XM, remember, and he spells remember without  the, uh, it's R-E-M-E-B, so it's remember, you dumb stuffy-nosed idiots.  Remember.  We're trying to stay on XM, so the XM failures are now still on XM, and the XM success, who 
[01:26:30]  I was never nationally syndicated, you idiot, has been kicked off.  You're a double-talking ass.  Let's see what kind of job our, uh, non-existent audience, how many did he say?  I don't know.  Like, uh, you know, no listeners.  Let's see how our non-existent, uh, audience, um, feels about that.  There you go.  Email, and go to his website and check it out.  And be supportive of this guy.  He's trying to stay on XM. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Well, instead of hearing Shannon Burke on XM 152, XM 152, you get to hear the Monsters  of the Morning, Tony Kornheiser, who's, uh, very, very talented, G. Gordon Liddy, the  Phillips File show, I guess, I never heard of him, the Phil Hendry show, very talented  guy.  Hey, Hendry.  What channel is that?  And the David Lawrence show.  Those are all the talk shows that beat out Shannon Burke.  So, is Monsters of the Midday still on?  They're in the morning.  They're on, uh, 152, I guess, when we're on. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so.  All right.  There you go.  Well, we have to take another break.  And, uh, we'll talk to this person that, uh, sent this email.  Where's that email again?  What's the email say?  About being bisexual.  Like you wanted someone to strap a dildo on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did he spell remember wrong in it?  Oh, he spelled everything wrong.  Oh.  Remember.  Remember.  Remember.  Do you have that email?  Which one?  I ripped mine up.  Wheel.  Whoops. 
[01:28:00]  Um.  Whoops-a-daisy.  We.  It doesn't matter.  I know.  After the break, the return of Wheelchair Fred.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  In case you didn't know. 
[01:28:30]  XM2 Hotel.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I've been to dream and different from all our lives.  This is the darling of the rest of our lives.  On holiday.  Way to go, Shannon. 
[01:29:00]  Way to go.  Not only are we not failures, we're going to decide who joins High Voltage in the coming  months.  Uh-huh.  Way to go.  Smart move, asshole.  I hear he's a conservative, too.  That may have been interesting.  Dope.  Anyway, Anthony, we got an email here from Wheelchair Fred.  Wheelchair Fred.  You want to describe Wheelchair Fred to the new audience?  Wow.  That is growing every single day, Anthony.  We met Wheelchair Fred when we were doing our time up there in Massachusetts. 
[01:29:30]  And he's confined to a wheelchair.  He was put in a wheelchair because of a motorcycle accident.  Screwed up his legs, not his spine.  So, you know, still has feeling and everything like that.  His legs were just so mangled, they, like, slapped him back together.  And he's got to roll around in a wheelchair.  His voice also got screwed up.  He got, like, hit in the throat with something.  And so his voice is screwed up. 
[01:30:00]  And he speaks with a slurred kind of, you can't even understand half of what he's saying  unless you're really around him for a while.  And he became a friend of the show.  He never got laid.  He just, after the accident, I guess, it was very hard for this guy to get laid  because he comes off like he's kind of retarded.  Yeah, a lot of people think he has a brain injury.  But he's not.  It's just that his voice box got completely crushed in this accident.  And he's in the wheelchair.  And, you know, he's screwed up.  And he's not paralyzed.  He's in this wheelchair, but he's not paralyzed.  The sad part about it is I think he had no insurance when he had his motorcycle accident. 
[01:30:30]  So he never got fixed right.  Yeah, they just kind of slapped him back together.  And now it's kind of too late to, you know, to try to get those mangled legs working again.  So he's in a wheelchair.  And, yeah, he's not getting laid and all that.  He's not getting laid.  So, you know, there was some speculation that he might have gone to the other team  just to kind of release himself, you know, picking up some guys.  Yeah, at the corner store or whatever that was. 
[01:31:00]  And he said it's not because he's gay.  He's just horny.  Or desperate.  He's desperate.  He just had to get laid.  Kind of like going to prison, I guess.  Yeah.  So that's kind of how we left him.  Right.  So he wrote us an email that says, I'm sorry, but I think I'm still bisexual.  I must admit, I do like it up the ass.  I even have a strap-on.  I guess he uses the strap-on on himself, Anthony.  Now, to find a chick to use it on me, that's his dream.  So, once again, ladies and gentlemen, let's say hi to Wheelchair Fred. 
[01:31:30]  Fred A.  Fred.  Yeah, we just found you a long time.  It's been a long time, Fred.  Yeah, how you doing?  We're doing pretty well, Fred.  I hear you cook big time on the radio.  Yeah.  Wait, I used to be able to speak Wheelchair Fred.  Or interpret Wheelchair Fred.  Go for it.  Are you listening to us on XM Satellite Radio?  No, I'm not. 
[01:32:00]  You can't afford that.  Oh, you can't afford it, huh?  Yes, got it.  So, what have you been up to, Fred?  Pretty much thinking I'll be fishing.  I'm still a horn dog.  What?  Wait, say that again.  I'm still a horn dog.  Oh, you're still a horn dog.  Okay.  All right.  With no luck, I haven't had a girl since the last century.  You haven't had a girl since the last century.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Ah, that's funny.  Since like 1999 or so, huh?  Exactly.  1999.  September 9th, I was laid.  Whoa.  When was the last time you got laid?  September 99.  September 99.  And what was his name?  No, no.  That was the chick.  That was the chick.  That was a girl.  A guy was...  That was the last time he got laid, but someone has laid him since then. 
[01:33:00]  Fred, what was her name?  I don't remember.  Was it Julie?  You don't remember her name?  No.  Just some...  Julie is heavy broad.  Fat broad?  Yeah, but that don't matter.  How did he pick up a girl, though?  I'm fascinated.  I knew her from earlier in life.  And she called me and made up the bar.  And she didn't come home with me. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  Called up, met up the bar.  And one thing led to another.  Came home with him, and one thing led to another.  And you wound up having sex.  Who made the first move?  Oh, I guess she had to.  He's in a wheelchair.  What?  Yeah, how did it go down, Fred?  Yeah, how did it happen?  Who made the first move?  I guess I did.  Would you fall out of the chair?  No. 
[01:34:00]  I'm quite good at the chair.  I've got to bring the belly of this chair.  I...  I heard I.  You guys don't meet you.  I go anywhere in this chair.  Oh, you go anywhere in the chair.  Yeah.  Don't you smile or anything?  So you got laid in September of 99.  Yeah.  And then since then, what's been happening with your sex life? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, I got in trouble.  Oh, I got arrested once.  You got arrested for what?  For getting angry and going off on the driver on the ride.  Wait, you were driving a car?  No, on the ride, which is a taxi service.  All right.  So you were in a taxi.  And what happened?  You were in a handicap. 
[01:35:00]  A handicapped taxi?  The driver was an a-hole.  Wait, the driver was an a-hole?  Yeah.  Why was he an a-hole?  It was 105 degrees outside.  He was dropping in the alley.  Which is like a half mile from my house.  And he dropped you off somewhere far from your house?  He wouldn't drop you off somewhere else.  And so how were the cops called? 
[01:35:30]  I looked off the guy who got scared.  What?  I looked off the guy who got scared.  You looked off the guy who got scared?  Yeah.  I don't understand what that means.  You took off?  I cursed the guy out and he got scared.  Oh, you cursed the guy out and the guy got scared and called the cops.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  And you didn't pay your fare?  No, I paid the problem with him.  You paid your fare, but he didn't drop you off where you wanted to be dropped off.  So you cursed him out.  He got scared and called the cops, right?  You got it.  So what did you get arrested for?  I believe God is afraid I would get physical with him.  What?  Because I was afraid I would get physical on his ass. 
[01:36:30]  He was afraid that you were going to get physical on his ass?  Yeah.  Are you in a wheelchair?  What could you do in a wheelchair?  You'd be surprised I could do quite a bit on his wheelchair.  He was going to have anal sex with him because he's so horny.  My upper body is quite strong.  Oh, all right.  He's got like that retard strength because he's been in a wheelchair, Anthony.  So his upper body strength is really strong.  That's what I have to say.  Society's very cruel to me. 
[01:37:00]  Society's very cruel to you?  Yeah, because they don't realize my problem.  It's physical, not mental.  It's physical, not mental.  Why don't you scream, I'm not an animal, so society understands.  I'm not an animal.  I'm not an animal.  That's what I said.  Say it again.  I'm not an animal. 
[01:37:30]  Wait, I've got to go to the phone.  Hold on, Fred.  The new listeners are just freaking out.  Mike in Florida, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Did you have to be an old listener to the show to understand what this guy is saying?  You pick up on how he talks after a while.  Yeah, you kind of get used to it.  Yeah, all I got out of that was I'm not an animal.  It's hilarious as hell, though.  All right, well, we're interpreting for him, though.  Hang in there.  Hang in there because we're going to start talking about his gay sex experiences. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, fantastic.  I can't wait.  All right, thanks, Mike.  All right, so you got arrested, Fred, for yelling at this cabbie.  Nothing ended up happening, though, right?  Nothing ended up happening.  The guy was just a wimp.  The what is a wimp?  The guy was just a wimp.  The guy was a wimp.  Oh, the guy was a wimp.  You could have taken him in a fight, right?  Yeah, I'll take you if you want. 
[01:38:30]  No.  No, that's okay, Fred.  No fighting.  So, now, Fred, where are you living these days?  I still live in the same place.  The same place.  Oh, that same little shithole.  I used to have to drive him home after he was on our show at AF.  What a pain in the ass that was.  He always needed a lift.  I had to, like, somehow try to lift him up into my car, then get the wheelchair in the back.  And then I would drop him off, then he would beg for money.  It was awful. 
[01:39:00]  Fred, you were an awful friend, I got to tell you.  Speak up, I can hardly hear you.  Speak up?  Yeah, talk around.  Now, today.  All right, listen.  So, you got to tell the gay story again.  Or have you had more gay sex since we last talked to you?  I have had only sex in a few years.  All right, so no sex in a few years.  But what happened with wheelchair Fred, he couldn't get women anymore.  He was very desperate. 
[01:39:30]  So, he decided, what the hell, I'll try to get laid by a guy.  Right, Fred?  Yeah, you got it.  And how did you accomplish that?  Did you...  First time was I met this guy from the radio.  Wait, you met a guy from the radio?  He heard me on your show.  And he met me and George and was like, hey, I'm horny.  Are you horny? 
[01:40:00]  Wait a minute.  All right, so you were on our radio show.  I got that much.  And one of our listeners heard you on the show, and he was horny, and he asked if you were horny?  Yeah.  But what, you guys were talking online or something?  No, we met at the deli by the house.  Met by the deli.  Is that the deli called the Green Awning or the Blue Awning?  No.  Green Awning.  What the hell am I thinking?  Someone wants us to come up with a parody song called What Said Fred instead of Right Said Fred. 
[01:40:30]  What Said Fred?  Wait, Fred, how did you guys hook up, though?  I know it was at the deli, but did we give your phone number out or something?  No, I was just at the deli, I guess.  You started saying something, and the guy recognized your voice?  Yes, he started walking.  Oh, he recognized your voice while you were at the deli, like Anja said.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, so you guys started talking, and who said they were horny first?  I don't know, it was years ago. 
[01:41:00]  It was years ago, but somehow or another, you guys started talking about how horny you both were, right?  Yeah.  All right, so then walk us through it.  Then what happened?  Roll us through it.  Then the guy came over.  The guy came over your house, would you invite him over?  Yeah.  So, and how much, was that the same day as the meeting at the deli?  Yeah.  So you went right back to your place?  Yes.  Wow, sexy. 
[01:41:30]  Yum.  Did he push you?  No.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Did you push back?  All right, so you were just really horny, but you claim, and to this day, you're just a straight guy, but you wanted action, so the guy's horny at the deli.  He pushes you back to your place, right?  Yeah.  All right, then you're in your place, then what happens?  I don't remember one thing led to another.  One thing led to another, but now who made the first move there? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, did you turn on your stereo?  Did you offer him a drink?  I don't remember.  You don't remember.  You've got to remember.  It's your first gay experience.  You don't have to remember.  It was so long ago.  It was like a year ago.  He's been trying to black it out of his memory bank since then.  Did you actually kiss?  No, I've never kissed a guy.  Oh, well, then everything's fine.  Yeah, I'm fine. 
[01:42:30]  All right, so you don't remember what you really, you know, what led to it, but then what happened?  We played for a lover and had intercourse anally.  Yeah, I had intercourse anally.  Yeah.  Did he do you or did you do him?  He did me.  I'll tell you, you've got to try it one day. 
[01:43:00]  Get a strap off your girl and tell your girl to use it on you.  What?  Get a strap on and tell your girl to use it on you.  Get a strap on and tell your girl to use it on you.  You'll be surprised you'll enjoy it.  You'll be surprised you'll enjoy it?  Yeah.  Fred, when you had another man's dick up your ass, what were you thinking?  I wasn't thinking that's the whole problem. 
[01:43:30]  I wasn't thinking.  You weren't thinking.  You were just enjoying?  Did what I had to do.  Did the guy give you the reach around?  What did you mean to reach around?  As he was banging you, did he reach around with his hand and take care of you?  No.  No?  How did you take care of yourself? 
[01:44:00]  You were in this, you were going gay to just get the sex.  How did you finish off?  I probably with my own hand.  Probably with your own hand.  Jesus.  The guy didn't even give you a handy?  And how did he prop you up because your legs don't work?  I was on my knees.  You're on your knees, bent all the way over?  Doggy style.  Doggy style.  Were you on your bed or just on the floor?  I was on the floor on the couch. 
[01:44:30]  Doggy that had been hit by a car style.  I think the guy just tipped the chair and then just mounted him while he was faith first in a rug.  Yeah, I think this is called rape.  All right, well, so you're kind of, so you're on the floor on your knees as he's going to town?  Yeah.  Did he last a long time?  I don't remember.  Did he use a rubber or was it bareback?  Of course he used rubber.  Of course.  Why would you say of course? 
[01:45:00]  I'm not stupid.  Like everyone gets to this situation and then of course you use rubber.  Huh?  I'm being used and horny, I'm not stupid.  He's horny, but he's not stupid.  I got you, Fred.  I got you.  I use rubber, male or female.  He uses rubbers, male or female?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Okay.  Oh, did he use any kind of lube, Fred, or did he just drive it home?  Of course.  What kind of lube?  Did he make you use your mouth to wetten it? 
[01:45:30]  No, K-Y.  K-Y?  Was there any oral sex, Fred?  No.  No, huh?  So, I mean, what did he say?  He just said, drop your pants?  I'm going to just...  No, we had to hang out for the rubber.  Just hanging out.  We just hang out once you go to another.  Well, how does one thing lead to another?  Yeah.  You know, it's not...  You don't just go from hanging out to having another man inside you.  Yeah, I hang out with Anthony and Jim, and it's never one thing leads to another. 
[01:46:00]  And then yada, yada, yada.  I got a dick in my ass.  A bunch of firemen show up, you know?  You say you're married back then, so you just have the urge.  What?  You guys were married back then.  We were married back then?  Are you saying...  You were married.  You did have the urge.  He's kind of right.  Because I was married, I know how it is to get a big dick up my ass.  I certainly do. 
[01:46:30]  Jesus.  Oh.  Wow, Fred.  All right.  And then, did the guy just say, take care?  He came back 12 times.  Oh, he came back.  Yeah, he liked that ass.  He must have a nice A.  He liked your A.  Yeah.  This guy had a sick fetish.  He's banging a freaking...  Bed sores on the hiney.  Sitting in the chair all day. 
[01:47:00]  He probably just walked out.  He probably just would zip his pants up.  Well, he's still face first in a pillow and his pants down, feces all over the place because  he can't wipe right.  Wipe his dick on the doily and just leave him there face first in a rug.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, Fred.  How humiliated did you feel after he left and you were still on the floor naked?  I was just humiliated.  What?  I felt fine. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, you felt fine.  Oh, you felt fine.  Fred, did he...  You never got taken care of, though?  Like, he never took care of you?  I don't think so.  You don't think so.  I never shot my load.  He never shot his load.  So, unless you take care of yourself, all you're really getting is dicked up the ass.  Sure, but there's a certain feeling when you get dicked up the ass. 
[01:48:00]  I bet there is.  It's called...  A certain feeling.  I get serious for a moment.  Yes, you get serious for a moment, sure.  Can I get serious for a moment?  Sure.  Yes, you can, Fred.  Society in general is very cruel.  Do it to have to get control?  Hold on, hold on.  We got to play some music for you, Fred. 
[01:48:30]  Hold on a minute, because you want to get serious for the audience, right?  Yeah, I do, so.  All right, hold on.  Anthony's got some music.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  Go ahead, Fred.  Society in general is very cruel.  Do it to have deaf people.  And?  That is?  That's my answer.  That's all I'm going to say.  All right, there you go.  Happy birthday to my son. 
[01:49:00]  Happy birthday to your son?  Friday, he'll be 20.  Friday, he'll be 20.  Let's hope he's listening.  I'm sure he's proud.  His name is Thomas Seaman.  Tom.  Thomas.  That's good.  Give his name away so his friends can go.  We heard your dad on the radio.  Talking about getting dicked in the ass?  Yeah, what the heck.  What the heck.  Happy birthday to Wheelchair Fred's son, Tom.  I can't believe I got a 20-year-old boy already. 
[01:49:30]  20-year-old boy.  Oh, you're talking about your son.  Yeah.  You're talking about your latest conquest.  No, I don't even look at my way.  So, Fred, you like things in your ass, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Does that make you gay, you think?  No.  So, having a man have sex with your butt isn't gay. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, I've got no sexual attraction towards men.  What did he say?  What was that?  I've got no sexual attraction towards men.  He's got no sexual attraction towards men.  Oh, all right.  But you let one have sex with you.  A few times.  Yeah, but he's a horn dog.  Because you're a horn dog.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, you also said in the email that, let's see, that you own a strap-on yourself, right? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  And you use it on yourself?  Occasion.  What did he say?  Occasion.  On occasion.  On occasion.  But how do you make that work?  How do you make that work?  Why don't you just use your bed post?  Well.  It's anchored nice.  Jesus.  You realistically could.  What? 
[01:51:00]  You realistically could.  Wow.  And what if I could or something?  You realistically could.  I was off.  You really?  You realistically.  You realistically?  Good.  Could.  You realistically could use the bed post?  Oh.  Yeah.  You're pretty stretched out these days, Fred.  Is that what you're saying?  I guess so.  All right.  But how do you use the strap-on? 
[01:51:30]  Like a dildo.  Oh, so you just grab it in your hand and go to town with it?  Yeah.  You do what you have to do.  You do what you have to do.  You don't have to do that, Fred.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I remember about, I guess it was like eight years ago,  you guys hooked me up with a ride, and the guy happened to me, Jay.  He's become a good friend of mine. 
[01:52:00]  We've never played with one another, but he's still a good friend of mine.  Who's still a good friend?  This guy you guys introduced me to on the radio.  Oh, okay.  We introduced you to that.  Yeah, we tried to help Fred out when we were up there.  We did?  We introduced you to a few people, and one of those guys is still one of your friends?  Yeah, my friend is your best friend in this state. 
[01:52:30]  Has he had sex with your butt?  No.  He's gay.  Perhaps he's gay, but we have no sexual attraction towards each other.  He is gay, but you have no sexual attraction towards each other.  I got you.  Okay.  All right.  Well, Fred, a great appearance on the brand new show here on XM Satellite Radio.  Wow.  Thank you.  Anything else you want to get off your chest?  I need what you want to do. 
[01:53:00]  I need action.  He needs action.  Oh, is that what he said?  Yeah.  So call me, Jim.  You want me to give out your email account so you can maybe get action?  Yeah.  All right.  What is your email account?  If people can figure it out, they'll write you.  Should I say on the radio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Let me figure. 
[01:53:30]  No one will understand it anyway.  It's Wheeler.  Wheeler?  Wheeler Derp.  What?  I got it.  The French AOL of the calm.  What is it again?  Wheeler Derp.  I got it.  What is it, Ope?  Wheeler Derp.  Wheeler Derp?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's a derp? 
[01:54:00]  Fred backwards?  Yeah, he got it.  Oh, clever, Fred.  Oh, thank you.  You're very clever.  Wheeler Derp at what?  And AOL of the calm.  Ah.  What's the matter?  Was Wheeler Gaff taken?  I didn't do that.  Wheeler Derp.  Wow.  All right.  You know, I hope our listeners will be kind to you, and I seriously mean that, because  Fred could use some pen pals. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  We got to get a...  We should really send Fred, I mean this, to a brothel where sex is legal.  I need action.  Wheelchair Fred needs action.  Do you still get it up, Fred?  No, I've gotten it up in years.  Wait, you haven't gotten it up in years?  I get up easily.  Oh, he gets up easily.  Oh, okay.  All right.  He just hasn't had sex.  He hasn't been able to use it.  It's good stuff that I'm running high. 
[01:55:00]  Why don't we get you like a blow-up doll or something?  Ugh.  So you can stay away from that man sex.  He seems to like the man sex.  Yeah.  Fred, you definitely like the man sex, even though you're not gay.  Fred, would you like an attractive girl to put a strap-on on and put it in your hiney?  Yeah.  No beating around the bush with Fred?  No.  Fred is a very...  Old Derf is a straight shooter.  Very horny.  All right.  Look this way.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  I don't think I'm going for anyone to let this girl present.  You don't want to get a girl pregnant?  I'm a ghost.  No more men unless there's a girl present.  No more men unless there's a girl present.  I got it.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  It's a new rule.  It's not gay if you're getting fucked in the ass.  If there's a girl going, go, Fred.  Go, Fred.  As long as there's a girl there.  Yeah.  She's a long way.  All right, Fred.  I think we're going to be doing a live broadcast from Boston, I don't know, down the road a little bit. 
[01:56:00]  We should have details on that.  If that happens, we want you to come by and say hi to everybody, all right?  All right.  I'm good.  Just e-mail me.  Huh?  Just have to put and e-mail me.  All right.  People will e-mail you, I'm sure.  Excuse me.  I'm sure.  All right, Durf.  Okay, bud.  All right.  Wheelchair.  Wheelchair.  Bye, Fred.  There he goes.  Wheelchair Fred.  The horn dog. 
[01:56:30]  You're a horn dog.  And one more time, I'm not an animal.  I'm not an animal.  All right, Fred.  Thanks.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  Thanks for your help.  All right.  My sound machine's turned off.  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hopi.  What?  Handsome machine was awesome.  I'm sorry.  Now, Megan, what's up?  I'm very glad that your booker finally got you a better guest than Bernie Getz. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  Yeah, there you have.  That was awful.  That was horrible.  Yeah.  We love Fred, though.  All you could hear was him drooling.  How can we love that little should have been aborted?  No, he got in an accident.  He's not retarded.  He had an accident.  We've seen pictures of Fred.  He used to be one of these tough biker dudes.  Biker guy.  Really tough.  And then what happened?  Like, I think he was riding his motorcycle without a helmet or something and got into just  a horrific accident.  Really bad.  Because I think an old guy, matter of fact, cut him off or something. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It was like a really tragic, awful, awful thing.  Laughing.  That's actually kind of funny.  Heartless twat.  You've got to love him.  Love you too, honey.  Thank you.  All right.  Punch it out.  Bye.  All right.  Family tragedy.  Jack Nicklaus.  What happened?  What happened?  Anyone know?  A kid drowned.  One of his kids drowned?  How old was his kid?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You're younger than an adult.  You know?  Baby.  Oh, wow.  That's awful.  That stinks.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  And we're going to talk to the dude that runs FARC.com next. 
[01:58:00]  Yes, true.  And then we've got Laszlo outside the studio.  He's going to talk about some tech stuff.  What?  What's that?  Why are you gargling?  No reason.  I don't get it.  Why are you just gargling?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  We just had a little news story.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Look at Banny.  He shakes his head.  Disgusting.  That's not cool, man.  Why?  What the hell?  I think it's very funny. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  It was Whip Him Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  You're going to save yourself.  And take it on me. 
[01:59:00]  You're going to save yourself.  And take it on me.  I'm eating.  I'm eating a muffin.  Who brought this, Eric?  My parents set it up for my birthday.  Oh.  Isn't that nice?  That's sweet.  What nice parents.  So everybody's out there getting food, of course, from these long breaks that we get.  It's so easy to run out, grab something to eat, take a leak, whatever you got to do. 
[01:59:30]  What did you get, Opie?  See, a bagel half with some cream cheese on it.  Mm-mm.  Scrum-diddly-icious.  I got a little muffin.  Dude, didn't we just break?  Yeah.  All right.  You know there's entire threads on message boards about us eating on the air? 
[02:00:00]  Well.  Entire threads, pages long, about us eating.  Some people say they don't want to hear us eating on the air.  Some people say it's okay.  They understand our plan.  I don't want to eat on the air, but, you know, try to go four hours without eating and see what happens to you.  If you're a Jim, try to go 15 minutes.  All right.  Stop the stacking.  We can still do the radio show.  Just get off the longer breaks.  Right.  Not a big deal.  Well, your mic wasn't turned on, so I don't know what you said.  I kept plowing through.  I don't care.  Say it.  I heard it, Jimmy. 
[02:00:30]  That's right.  All right.  Listen.  Huh?  Anthony, you check out that FARC.com, right?  Yeah.  I go in there a lot.  I love the Photoshop thing.  Every day, they present a couple of pictures.  You download the picture, and then you Photoshop it in a humorous fashion, and then upload it back up there, and people comment on it.  Well, there's a lot going on with that website, right?  FARC.com.  A lot of news.  They got the goofy stories of the day, and then I'm trying to read a few right now. 
[02:01:00]  Kobe Bryant reaches settlement and civil trial, agrees to drop off money at the back door.  I don't know.  Who writes these clever titles to their stories?  I guess that case is over, by the way.  The civil case is complete with Kobe Bryant.  And the accuser there, she's already married and pregnant or something like that?  Yeah.  Saw the picture of her.  She's a great catch, huh? 
[02:01:30]  Let's go to Drew Curtis.  Hey, Drew.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, I'm doing great.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Pretty good.  We're in the middle of eating and doing a radio show and talking to you.  It's nuts.  It's insane in here.  It's a mess.  Now, you were on, of course, FARC.com?  Yep, that's right.  How long ago did you start it?  I started it about six years ago.  I was basically sending weird stories out to friends of mine who decided they were getting kind of annoyed by it,  so I decided to start a website instead and told them about it, and it just kind of took off from there. 
[02:02:00]  Isn't that something how successful websites get started?  It always starts with just some guy screwing around with a computer.  Were you getting some goofy stories together, sending them off to friends, and then all of a sudden you figured you'd consolidate them on one site?  Yeah, pretty much.  It's kind of funny.  A friend of mine says that you wouldn't actually believe that a case for a website like FARC would actually work, except that it did.  Yeah.  How many hits a day would you say you get?  We're getting about 1.7 million right now.  1.7 million hits a day.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it's ridiculous. 
[02:02:30]  That's about right up there with the New York Daily News and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Yeah.  And what else, besides the stories every day, what else do you got on FARC?  Well, like you guys were talking earlier, we've got the Photoshop contest.  We've also branched out a little bit in doing some audio edit for people who do a little bit of sound mixing and have lately been testing a video edit contest where people take their camcorders out and try to make new endings to crappy movies or commercials for strange products, et cetera.  It's been working pretty well.  Yeah, I've been wanting to get in on one of those.  I love the Photoshop thing. 
[02:03:00]  They've got some really funny people that contribute to that.  I'm absolutely amazed by that, actually.  I was contacted by somebody who was an administrator at a community college, I'm guessing, up in Ohio, who was saying that rather than when he's teaching Photoshop to his students, rather than assign homework, he goes ahead and tells them to enter the contest and see if they can win.  Yeah, it's a great way to practice up on your Photoshop skills.  And you also have, what is it?  I see a lot of chicks on your site. 
[02:03:30]  I see, like, personals.  What the hell is that about?  Well, essentially we have, there's an interesting person on the Internet that you run into, usually female, called the Internet Attention Whore.  Yeah, Internet Attention Whore.  Yeah, and they're basically the ones that are running around going, look at me, look at me.  Well, we have a lot of those on FARC, not surprisingly, and we decided to go ahead and set up a little area where they could hang out, and so that's the main thing there.  The strange thing about the women on FARC is there aren't a lot of them.  I'd say it's about 20% of the readers.  But the amusing thing about it is that they're all hot. 
[02:04:00]  It's the weirdest thing in the world.  Now, that's nice.  At least you're getting the hot ones.  Yeah, we have FARC parties pretty regularly.  I'd say probably about, there's one going on somewhere every week.  And in general, the ones that have been showing up are just absolutely smoking.  And you wouldn't think that would be the case for an Internet site, but, you know, hey, whatever.  I can't explain it, but I'll go with it.  Yeah, they've got these parties that go on.  Now, they announce them on the site, and it'll just be like some bar down in Texas, and people get together down there? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What will happen is there will be somebody in a particular city that will want to set one up,  and basically we just help them out by putting the announcement out and letting everybody know what's going on.  One of the more amusing parties I heard about was, well, actually there's two.  One was, we held one in London, England, when David Blaine was doing that stunt to hang out in that box for however long it was,  like, you know, 50 days in a row or whatever.  Yeah.  And we had a whole bunch of people show up and laser pointer him all at once. 
[02:05:00]  I actually got video of it.  It's hilarious.  Laser pointer.  A bunch of tools.  Should have thrown rocks at the box.  Yeah, or other things, that's for sure.  I thought it was funny how scared he was for his own life.  I mean, he was really just annoying.  No one was actually going to kill the guy.  Yeah, who cares about David Blaine?  Seriously.  Jesus Christ.  Who writes the little comments about the stories?  Because those are really funny.  Yeah, about three-quarters of them are sent in by the people that actually submit the link.  Like, for example, the one you were just reading, the Kobe Bryant one, that was actually submitted by the readers. 
[02:05:30]  So we went ahead and posted that.  The other 25% I either tweak or I edit and write myself.  See, the guy understands the concept of letting the, well, we let the listeners, but you, the contributors,  let them do the funny, and you can just sit back and reap the profits.  They're so much funnier than I am.  It's just hard not to.  You're making money off of this thing?  You've got to be, right?  A little bit, actually.  Basically, it's been more to pay the bills, but I've been stockpiling everything away to try to help fund our first lawsuit protection fund.  Yeah, that's got to be coming, right? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, it's just a matter of time.  I've already had, I get about a threat a week over Photoshop contests, and so I figure it's a matter of time before somebody gets fired and decides to take it out on us.  There was a lot of excitement on FARC about the naming of the fleet center?  Yeah, that's right.  We went ahead and purchased a day.  It was actually a Monday.  We went ahead to a snag it off of eBay for the low, low price of $2,500.  That sounds low to, or high to some people, but the price for the first one that was sold went for $35,000 to, of course, Golden Palace Casino. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  What did you guys decide on?  We, after, the first one I submitted to them was the FARC.com Duke Sucks Center.  They rejected that in about five minutes.  Sure.  The second one we submitted was the FARC.com UFIA Arena, which stands for Unsolicited Finger and Anus.  Unfortunately, they have Google, and they figured out what that was real quick.  They first shot that down.  That's very funny. 
[02:07:00]  But the one we finally went to was Boston Garden.  Boston Garden, huh?  Yeah, I had a suspicion that that might not get picked up, too, because I wondered how much of a, you know, flack those guys had gotten.  You know, I don't know if any of them were still around from back in the day when they named it the Fleet Tenor in the first place.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I heard somebody wanted to name it, like, the Derek Jeter Center.  Yeah, that was supposed to happen yesterday.  What happened was that they had a long talk with the guy and finally convinced him to call it something else,  and they actually named it a Boston Garden also. 
[02:07:30]  A lot of people talk about the, from what I was reading, a lot of people don't like the politics of FARC.  A lot of, they say the political commentary is a little left.  Well, what's funny is it actually goes both directions.  We try to keep it so we can mix the articles up, mainly because it's my, I actually hate politics.  I kind of fall right down the middle.  I find most politicians to be self-centered and be a bunch of jackasses.  So it's really hard to get behind people that are like that. 
[02:08:00]  So what we try to do is we try to, like, we'll bash Bush one day and then we'll praise him the next,  or sometimes actually in the same day we'll do it.  Yeah, I notice on a lot of the Photoshop things there's always a George Bush picture in there just being pummeled.  Yeah, it just depends on where we get on the particular day.  We took a survey of our readers and it turns out that the political bent is a perfect bell curve.  We've got equal numbers of extreme liberals and conservatives and kind of, you know, topping out right in the middle,  which is really kind of unusual. 
[02:08:30]  You don't see that very often on the Internet.  Hey, you put a lot of stories up here.  What's, like, the most memorable of these weird stories that come from all over the world that you can remember recently?  One of the most memorable, just for the pure humor value of it, this just cracked me up.  It was right after 9-11.  And surprisingly, it was the only thing funny that happened for that entire week.  But there was some jackass out in Malaysia, I think it was,  had tried to print up a poster in support of Osama bin Laden.  And what he had done, we, somebody figured out later on, 
[02:09:00]  is he punched in Osama bin Laden into Google and just printed the first 20 pictures that came out.  Yeah.  One of the pictures that he printed out was from a site called Bert is Evil,  which is a website that no longer exists because after this happened, they got a lot of flack.  I remember that one.  They're kind of implying that, you know, Bert from Sesame Street is actually evil.  And they've got pictures with him with Hitler and, you know, all these other guys.  And one of the pictures they had printed out was him sitting next to Osama bin Laden.  It was absolutely hilarious.  And weren't there some fanatics that were supporting bin Laden actually holding these signs up? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, they were.  They were, like, waving them around, and you see Osama bin Laden sitting next to Bert,  and it was just totally ludicrous.  I remember that.  What was that story I saw yesterday about the girl?  There was some sex play with a gun involved?  Yeah.  It's kind of funny because the article danced around the specifics because, you know,  print media and all that.  But, yeah, it looks like they were basically messing around with a handgun during, quote,  bizarre bedroom activities.  He was screwing her with the barrel of the gun, it sounded like. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And it went off.  Oh, my God.  And she got shot in the vagina.  She lied?  Yeah, that'll happen, you know.  I mean.  Yeah, she actually lived through it, I guess, last I heard.  I don't know if they do any follow-up stories on these things.  Yeah, well, can you imagine you're going to high school and, you know, I mean, that's you  for the rest of your life.  You'll be back at the 10-year reunion.  You know, it's a girl that got shot in the hoo-ha.  It's an old bullet snatch.  And everyone knows the decent thing to do is pull out and shoot at the face.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, they probably should have.  It said it was with her 23-year-old boyfriend.  That's scary enough right there.  And how old was she? 
[02:10:30]  She was 17.  Boy, you're in a lot of trouble when you're caught shooting a 17-year-old in the vagina.  Is this a story, teacher arrested for having sex with a 2-year-old in backseat?  Yeah, that actually is a little bit of a misleading headline.  The teacher is actually having sex with one of their students, not that this makes it any  better.  Oh, okay, with a 2-year-old in the backseat.  Well, what's even better was the 2-year-old in the backseat was videotaping it. 
[02:11:00]  I'm going to go to Doug Out Doug here.  Doug Out Doug, what's up?  Well, I don't know.  Well, thanks, Anthony, for stealing my question about the Fleet Center.  Ah, okay.  But I'll go ahead and I'll ask, Drew, whenever you have guys like you that run these websites  that are so popular, what kind of web surfing do you do?  You know, I actually don't do a whole lot of it because the number of submissions that  comes in every day is usually top 2,000.  So I don't ever have to wander around very much at all. 
[02:11:30]  It's about all I can do to keep up with the queue.  That being said, though, there's a few sites I check out every day, and one of them,  is like the Smoking Gun.  Yeah.  And I'm a huge fan of Homestar Runner, which is just a little bizarre, evil caveat of mine.  I definitely find your site more entertaining than like a Drudge or something where you go  there for the headlines, and occasionally you'll get some goofy, fun headline on Drudge.  But for the most part, I've been going to your site a lot more.  Yeah, we're trying to skew everything towards comedy rather than towards one political ideology 
[02:12:00]  or another because, you know, I'd rather laugh than talk about politics any day.  Do you guys have a lot of audio up there on that site, too?  Not too much, actually, but we're getting more and more of the, like I said, we've got the  audio editing contest, and those are coming on stronger and stronger as time goes on.  You know what else is good?  You guys, any new video that comes in, some of this outrageous video like the Pizza Punch  one, it ends up on your site, you know, and it's a good place to get that new video.  You've seen that one, obviously, right?  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  Speaking of the video, there's one I've actually got queued up for later this morning. 
[02:12:30]  It's a guy shooting a non-semi-automatic handgun, just a regular single action eight times  in 2.9 seconds.  Wow.  At six different targets.  Regular Bernie gets.  Yeah.  Is it, did you notice that a lot of your traffic, because I heard a lot of it was filtered from  eatabullet.com, like a lot of the people.  You whore.  That's what I heard.  Wow, what a plug whore.  Plug whore.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Plug whore.  Hey, do you guys show, like, are you guys showing stuff like Ogre does, or do you not get 
[02:13:00]  as graphic?  No, we don't, actually.  And that's just sort of the way I like to run the site.  It depends on what it is, though.  Well, if it's something that we just absolutely can't avoid whatsoever, like a good example,  there was, we ran an article last week where there was a car chased out in St. Louis where  the guy flipped over several times and got thrown out of the car.  Oh, it was great.  And normally I'll try to avoid that, but what will eventually happen is if we keep on getting  the same article submitted over and over and over again, there's obviously some kind  of a demand for it, so we'll end up running it then.  Imagine being on the road that that guy, like, completely jumped a highway in this SUV. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, when he went off, he flew through the air, like, the entire car flew through the  air, like, several hundred feet, and I'm not exaggerating, it was absolutely insane.  It was really some piece of video.  Hits the ground, rolls, and he just flies out of the thing and smashes on the ground  very hard.  It lands on him, right?  It almost did.  Yeah, almost.  It didn't fly all over him, but he died anyways.  And I found myself watching it going, come on, come on, roll, oh, a little anticlimactic.  You wanted it to kind of roll on top of him, but yeah, he died anyway, so.  Yeah, so it's all the same. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, how about the video of the guy leaning out the car and getting his face smashed against  the bumper?  We've heard the stories about that one.  Oh, yeah, that's a good one.  Did that guy, did we've heard he died, we've heard he lived?  I heard he died.  Wow, yeah, see, I heard he lived.  We heard he lived.  I actually had an interview on some website.  Yeah, I've heard both stories.  I want to know what happened.  Yeah, it's a strange thing.  I love those little videos like that, especially the ones where people are doing stupid, stupid  things.  Like, I've got one where there's guys standing up on top of his car driving by leaning down  through the window, and he ends up breaking it into a tree. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, I saw that when he's trying to drive from outside his vehicle.  Yeah, it's great.  And it heads toward the tree, and he can't turn it in time.  God bless him.  I'm sure all these videos are from Florida.  It wouldn't surprise me.  Yeah, a bunch of morons.  Hey, do you have the news reporter stepping in grapes and then falling out on her fat face  and not being able to breathe?  Yes, I saved that one.  I can't get enough of that one.  Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.  That's one of my favorite videos of all time.  Mine, too.  Well, Drew...  That and horse gag.  Horse gag.  I remember horse gag.  Let's not forget horse gag.  Or as I like to call it, lucky girl. 
[02:15:00]  You ever seen horse gag?  No, I haven't.  Oh, my God.  That was one of those video clips when all this was first starting, what, five, six,  seven years ago?  Speciality.  Yeah, where that video clip was emailed to everybody.  Oh, there's why.  Yeah, because I tell people, if anything happened in the last six years, I've seen it.  Otherwise, not to like it.  You should go old school and find horse gag.  Yeah.  Old school video clip.  Yeah, it's really hot.  Well, I know, Drew, from reading FARC, there were some people that were a little leery about  you coming on our program. 
[02:15:30]  But I want to thank you for coming on, and I think it was painless, wasn't it?  Oh, yeah, no problem at all.  I loved it.  It was great.  Why did they want him on our show?  Who was leery?  Well, some people are like, you know, oh, O and A, it's going to, you know, degenerate  into something.  Like, they assume that everybody we get on, we treat like...  Shit.  Like we treated Cindy Williams from Laverne and Shirley or something.  Or the dude from Hogan's Heroes.  Hogan's Heroes.  Or numerous other people.  Or Ed Asner.  Or Ed Asner.  Or Bernie Gatz.  Or, yeah, all right, all right, I get it. 
[02:16:00]  I see their point now.  Yeah, sure.  Now, Drew, but I love the site, and I am opant on it, O-P-A-N-T, and I love, I'm always  on the Photoshop thing, brushing up on my Photoshop skills.  And who's Toxic Bunny as we go to break here?  Oh, who knows?  I've got no idea.  Oh, all right.  It says, in my bedroom, you'll find everything except my floor.  Ooh.  I guess she's a messy girl.  All right, very good.  Yeah, I actually don't recognize most of the readers, because we've got almost 250,000  registered accounts right now, so I don't recognize maybe like 10 of them. 
[02:16:30]  It's in the FARC personals.  Oh, very good, yeah.  No, I'm the slightest idea.  Are they free, the FARC personals?  What's that?  Are the FARC personals free?  They're free to look at.  They're not free to talk to.  It's some weird little contrived thing that we've got working with a third-party organization,  but yeah.  Okay.  Nice.  Rolling in the cash.  Rolling in the cash on that FARC.  All right.  Well, thank you, Drew.  No problem.  Thank you, guys.  We greatly appreciate it.  It's FARC.com, F-A-R-C.com, if you've never checked it out. 
[02:17:00]  It's a lot of fun.  Thanks, Drew.  Very cool.  Take care.  All right.  There he goes, Drew, from FARC.com.  Sure.  I enjoy the site.  Very funny.  That's a lot of traffic.  1.7 million hits a day.  A lot of people go there.  The site's definitely got a buzz.  Yeah.  I've heard of it.  I've never been to it, but I've heard it's good.  Speaking of websites, ourfoundrymusic.com does quite well, Anthony.  The defensive Steve gets.  He comes right in.  Yeah.  Mice.  The problem with FARC is what about my site?  I didn't...  Whoa.  Oh, shit.  What did I just do?  What are you doing?  Ripping the mic up. 
[02:17:30]  Take it easy.  Sorry.  When did it start doing that?  Now I'm having a pipe.  Take it easy.  Whoops.  Steve, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  That's right.  We love Whip Him Out Wednesday.  You get a wow on your car, and the girls, if they feel like it, they'll flash their boobs.  It's been happening for seven, eight years now.  That's right.  We've got the wow bumper stickers.  You get one by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York.  The address to send the self-addressed stamped envelope is on our website, openanthony.com.  But we're taking it to the next level, aren't we, Steve?  That's right.  We had a section on the website for the last couple of years called Wow Me. 
[02:18:00]  And the problem is, the website got so, so big over the last couple of years that those  pictures kind of got buried.  And what they were was just anonymous shots usually sent in by ladies with wow usually  across their chest and their naked chest, sometimes with the faces, sometimes without.  And we would put them up and share them with everybody.  And I think, and Jeff and I were under the impression that I think these were getting  lost, so we created a brand new website called ratemywow.com.  Rate my wow. 
[02:18:30]  That's right.  I mean, basically it's just a collection of boob shots, but we thought that was a little  boring, so we had to think of one little extra thing to...  A little catch, sure.  Yeah, a little catch.  So we took all those wow me shots, slapped them up on this ratemywow.com, and now you  can look at them and it's just boobs.  People can submit as many as they want, and you can vote on them, and the highest rated  ones appear, and you know, that's it.  It's just very easy.  And you can get to ratemywow.com through Foundry Music.  OpianAnthony.com. 
[02:19:00]  Everything's linked, right?  Everything's linked up.  Steve's smart that way.  Everything's linked up here and there.  That's right.  So that went online this morning?  Went online this morning.  Not all the pictures are up.  I think there's about 400 that we have to go through.  Wow.  And yeah, that we just haven't gotten through.  I think we got through maybe 100 of them last night.  So in the coming weeks, it's going to become huge.  Yeah.  And then you sit there at home and you just check out all these girls, you know, their  boobs, and you rate their boobs.  I mean, and I think it was a good move because within like five minutes of it going live, we  got three new pictures, so. 
[02:19:30]  Are there any girls with like big nips there, or like big areolas?  Yes, tons.  I love big areolas, man.  I love that.  You like it to look like a moose's nose.  Dude, you remember the voyeur bus incident, the girl?  Oh, we know who you loved on that one.  That was terrific.  Oh, my God.  That was horrific.  Dude, she's one of the sexiest girls ever.  Absolutely not.  It's all in the eye of the beholder, bro.  Absolutely all in the eye of the beholder.  That horrified me.  Everyone else was like, oh, she could possibly have the worst tits ever. 
[02:20:00]  I loved them.  I thought they were tumors.  I didn't know what the hell was going on.  No.  It was a big.  They were.  I would have broken their honey jars.  A big, long tube is what they were.  They were like bananas with the nip.  It wasn't really a nip.  It was just a brown spot on the end of her titty.  Like a yarmulke.  Right.  A brown breast yarmulke.  Yeah.  And I just wanted to suckle them and make baby noises.  You know what it looked like?  Remember Carvel used to have chocolate bonnets? 
[02:20:30]  It was a vanilla cone and they would dip it in chocolate.  That's what her tit looked like.  That was his brown nipple with these pointy things.  I'm more into the slow fade myself.  I like them too.  But I mean, when it looks like you dipped your boobs in chocolate syrup.  In chocolate syrup.  A chocolate bonnet.  And they had cherry bonnets too.  It's cherry syrup.  Oh, that's funny.  I loved Carvel.  But I also like little A or B cup breasts with those big, thick, fat nipples.  I love those too.  What a freak show.  It's not.  I love that. 
[02:21:00]  It's hot.  Normal nips.  I like them too.  But I mean like A or B cups with those little, like the nipples that almost get thicker as  they go away from the body.  You ever see those?  They're like buttons.  Big, thick, rubbery.  They're all puffy.  You mean the diameter closest to the boob is thinner?  Not much, but a little bit.  And then it gets puffy.  Yeah, big, fat.  As it works its way outwards.  Thick nips.  Right.  All right, well, so RateMyWOW.com, a brand new website from Steve.  Old toad school tip. 
[02:21:30]  That's right, yeah.  All right, very good.  Do you guys get more hits than Fark or no?  No, no, they blow us away.  Fark's huge.  I'm asking him, Steve does good traffic.  No, I mean, he does.  Yeah, he does decent, but Fark just blows us out of the water.  Well, Fark has Photoshop stuff.  Fark's on a daily basis gets a lot of hits, you know.  We have our moments where we really get up there.  Yeah, I mean...  And it's easy to remember Fark.com, FoundryMusic.com.  Half the people don't even know how to spell Foundry.  Dude, Fark is probably the easiest site ever to navigate. 
[02:22:00]  Look, there's a story, click them there.  And you are bummed.  But I will tell you this, Fark people don't stay there.  People stay on Fark for, not to slag them, but if you look at the average use of a website,  generally it's three to five minutes.  People are on Foundry for upwards of 20 minutes.  People are trying to figure out how to use it.  Spinning ratings for websites.  I'm telling you.  He's spinning it.  I'm spinning it.  He's spinning the rating.  Well, they say there are two and a half computers for every single hit.  Really, Steve Lowe?  They're there for 20 minutes because they're trapped inside the thing,  and they're trying to find their way back out. 
[02:22:30]  It's all scientific.  Click to download, but not here.  What the fuck does this mean?  Smart ad.  Oh, God.  That's why.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  Just this morning, about 10 minutes ago, I'm driving on the 5 freeway through LA,  and a red big rig truck with kind of an older lady driving it.  Just saw the wow sticker on the back of my car, or my car, and she whipped her tits out. 
[02:23:00]  These had to be the ugliest tits I've ever seen in my life.  Kind of like dog-eared.  It looked like she spilled coffee on a white shirt.  Hey, Jimmy, when are you coming to LA?  It'll be a little while, but I go out to LA a little more often.  I'm actually starting to like it out there, and I never thought I would,  but I'm actually enjoying my last few trips.  Yeah, LA's fun.  Yeah, I have to admit, I'm really starting to like LA.  We'll be back sooner than later, but that's funny.  But you know what, Mike?  It kind of put a smile on your face, didn't it? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah, for sure.  You know, she's got to be listening right now.  It was like a red, I don't know, Peterbilt, Kenworth, whatever.  I was driving like a cream-colored Escalade.  She's got to hear right now.  Sorry about your tits, but you know, drive it through.  Maybe you can stop by and get some surgery or something.  Hey, Jimmy, maybe you can call Voss.  He can put in a good word for you and get you out of here earlier.  Well, Voss was out there doing the Oscars, so maybe Voss could hook me up a little bit.  He's an important man in the industry.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you, guys.  There you go.  I'm nice to hear there's wows going on in LA, though.  I like that.  Yeah, as soon as you can. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, it's slowly but surely growing all across the country now.  You all right, Darrell?  Not really.  Somebody pat Oats back, please.  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  All right, we've got Laszlo.  He's going to come in and say hi to us.  Yeah.  And we've got other things.  You brought a lot of audio in today.  Any of this stuff worth playing, Steve?  I forgot what I brought in.  Hold on a second.  The story about the chick that got killed in Lower East Side is pretty, you know, actually,  it's kind of infuriating when you hear the story.  It is really infuriating. 
[02:24:30]  Goddamn lawyers.  We should play this here.  Yeah, it's the, you heard the story.  I think it made it national.  Oh, yeah.  It's one of those stories that really get you pissed off.  Actress girl and her fiancÃ©, they were hanging out with friends.  And they leave a bar about three in the morning or so, walk outside, and a group of thugs,  a group of savage animals, come out of nowhere and attempt to rob them. 
[02:25:00]  The actress girl there, what was her name?  Nicole.  Nicole.  Nicole.  Dufresne, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She does something really stupid.  It's not her fault, obviously, that she's dead, but, you know, she did something stupid.  She's mouthing off to the guy that had the gun.  The guy shot her, you know, shoots her right in the chest, leaves her there to die.  And now they're all scrambling, ratting each other out, trying to make deals.  And they're actually saying that Nicole had pushed the guy with the gun, and he slipped 
[02:25:30]  in the snow, and the gun went off.  What bullshit that is.  And I hope that it's not a jury of equal savages that would buy this story and let them go.  I would like to know.  Look, I understand there's been an awful history, a lot of times, of white-on-black crime, and  certain crimes are hate crimes.  I just want to know, when is the last time a black-on-white crime was called a hate crime?  When?  I'm sure it's happened. 
[02:26:00]  I've never heard of it.  I would love to know, when has that ever happened?  I'm sure someone has an example.  I'd like to know when.  Obviously, you know, a movie is not considered a hate crime, because that's an older one.  This one won't be.  Reginald Denny wasn't called a hate crime.  Reginald Denny, when is it considered a hate crime?  If it's not white cops beating a black guy, then it's a hate crime.  There's just a disproportionate amount of violence in the black community, unless it's taken  care of, and even addressed by a black leadership, there's just going to be underlying prejudice. 
[02:26:30]  Interesting that Jimmy should say that, because when you listen to this clip, you know, the  reasoning that one of the suspects gives for why she got into a fight with Nicole is  exactly that, is she hated the fact that she was having such a good time.  Well, let's listen to this.  Well, it's not really a hate crime.  I mean, it's racially, I'm saying a racially-based hate crime.  Yeah, let's listen to this.  Indictments tonight against four teenagers in connection with the murder of the young  New York actress, Nicole Dufresne.  And now, one of the teens says she started the confrontation that led to Ms. Dufresne's 
[02:27:00]  shooting, because the actress and her friends, we're quoting now, looked happy.  I would assume this report, Jim Dolan, on the Lower East Side for us tonight with  the story.  I deserve some happiness.  Looked happy.  Why ain't I happy?  Ugh.  Same as that pig in the pizza place.  Kill them.  Just kill them.  His fat hog bitch girlfriend is getting in a brawl, and he has to go over there and belt  some guy in the face. 
[02:27:30]  It's ridiculous.  Same as this.  It is the same as this.  Just ridiculous.  Kill them.  Just, just, she should be hung upside down by her ankles and have her throat cut like  a lamb.  There you go.  Jim.  Even before all this, Bill, the murder of Nicole Dufresne seemed like a cold-blooded affair,  but we never knew how infantile its origin, nor how casually a young life was taken that  night.  But tonight, we get a first-hand account from two of those who admit being there the night  it happened.  No respect for life. 
[02:28:00]  One of them admits starting it all because Nicole and her boyfriend seemed so happy.  Yeah.  Look at those happy-  Add to the mountain of evidence that includes surveillance tape of the suspects, a shocking,  bizarre statement from one of those accused in the murder of 28-year-old actress Nicole  Dufresne.  Gunned down last month during what seemed like a robbery attempt at the time, but looks now  far more strange.  One of the suspects, 18-year-old Ashley Evans, says her friends were making fun of her that 
[02:28:30]  night because she never got into fights.  To silence them, she says, she vowed to punch the next person they saw on the street.  We then seen, Evans says in her statement, Nicole and her fiancÃ© and the other couple.  They were extremely happy, she says, so that made me even angrier.  Why it made her angry, she does not explain in the statement.  But she goes on to describe how Ms. Dufresne resisted the robbery even after they had her  purse. 
[02:29:00]  Nicole then bumped into me in a fierce rage to assault Rudy, Rudy being 19-year-old alleged  gunman Rudy Fleming.  She pushed him twice, shouting, you got what you wanted, she says in the statement.  He pushed her off as if to warn her.  She came at him again, Evans says, pushing him, causing his foot to get caught in the snow.  So, and that, she says, is when the gun went off.  Right, right, right.  Oh, well, okay, let him go.  Let him go.  I'm sure he'll be a productive member of society after you let him go. 
[02:29:30]  Well, obviously it's her fault.  She's pushing this guy, this poor kid, this poor underprivileged kid.  Oh, they just wanted a little happiness.  And then they see the happiness.  It's their upbringing.  Why aren't they happy?  They deserve to be happy.  So when they saw the happiness on their face, all that from a culture up to, shut up.  More babble from these fucking lawyers.  And do you even hear the media?  This is why I despise the media. 
[02:30:00]  You hear the way this asshole reporter said, and this is where it gets more strange.  Really?  Is that the way you phrased it when Justin Volpe raped Abner Louima?  And he should be doing 30 years.  He's an animal.  Louima's an innocent guy who was brutally assaulted.  And this fucking guy should be doing 30 years.  Right.  But why is it never from the opposite side looked at like that?  It's not.  This is when it got more strange, when he ripped down Louima's pants.  No, it was called the brutal racial assault that it was.  So why is this not viewed the same way by the media? 
[02:30:30]  That's why people always email me, stop attacking liberals.  That's why I attack liberals, dude.  It's this kind of mentality.  This kind of softening of what actually happened.  Yep.  The account is contradicted, though, somewhat, by another defendant, David Simmon,  who says only that Nicole walked back toward Rudy and pushed him.  And Rudy shot her.  Back at the house, the statement goes on.  We all told Rudy he shouldn't have done that.  Oh, good.  He shouldn't have done that.  Because so far, six people have been charged in connection with Dufresne's murder. 
[02:31:00]  Live on the Lower East Side, Jim Dolan, Channel 7.  I want to see you.  You know, I'm tired of black people with the guns, okay?  I'm really tired of it.  God.  You know, the shooting's out at Hot 97.  Do you read that whole thing?  With the rap war that's going on?  It's music, you friggin' idiots.  And they're going to...  I guarantee 50 Cent is going to end up dead.  He will be shot.  Or the other guy. 
[02:31:30]  Or the other guy.  Yeah, this is just gearing up.  There's this whole thing in that culture that says, you know, if you're disrespected, or in order to get respect, not even if you're disrespected, just in order to get respect, you have to be a fucking animal.  You have to kill people.  You have to knock down people that are happier than you.  What?  Where is that coming from?  300 years ago?  Is that where it still comes from? 
[02:32:00]  I'm sorry.  The excuse is running a little thin.  There's plenty of opportunity out there for everybody.  There's no need to be running around shooting people like this.  It's just...  It makes you racist.  It turns people into racist.  People that would normally go, yes, I am going to judge that person based on the content of their character and not the color of their skin.  And then you judge them on the content of the character, and the character stinks. 
[02:32:30]  See, the problem is, I don't even care.  Guys like 50 Cent or other rappers.  I mean, these guys are thugs.  That's what they do.  They used to sell crack.  They used to be street thugs themselves.  I mean, they're really tough dudes.  It's how they deal with things, whatever.  That's their problem.  Right.  My problem is, like, MTV and these other places have no problem, even after all the shootings, still showing the video.  Fine.  But then, God forbid, you make an anti-gay remark, or you make some politically incorrect joke or some type of a remark.  They will...  And again, Dice.  Booted off MTV for life for using a little dirty language. 
[02:33:00]  Meanwhile, in thug culture, where guys are shooting at each other, because they're popular, they're still welcomed on MTV to do interviews and all this stuff.  It's just that hypocritical, sickening, one-way street mentality.  Yeah.  So, let's say hi to Derek in Texas.  Derek, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  I just wanted to make a couple of points.  Number one, you're right.  Black people need to get off that bullshit about 300 years ago.  It's just over with.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:33:30]  Move on.  And I'm 24 years old.  Bust my ass.  Work hard.  Make a good living.  Live a good life.  I don't need to sell drugs and shit.  It's probably some black motherfucker out there listening right now.  Probably think I'm some sellout, but I'm just as hard as that motherfucker.  A sellout.  Yeah.  How black people are sellouts if they actually contribute to society and work and raise a family.  Then you're a sellout.  You got no street cred.  We're just speaking the truth.  I hear you. 
[02:34:00]  I can survive on the same street if they motherfuckers can.  But I just wanted to make that point, man, and I'm glad y'all let me get on the radio.  All right.  Thanks, Derek.  All right.  Y'all take it easy.  All right.  Yeah.  Hard-working black people, you just, I, you know, I feel for you.  I really do.  It's got to just be a bitch.  Some guy trying to raise his family, working for a living, and you just pop on the news.  And I don't even want to hear that, oh, it's the news's fault because they broadcast this stuff.  Like they're searching out stories.  Oh, we got a story of a white guy doing this or an Asian guy or this guy. 
[02:34:30]  But let's put the black people.  Let's just focus on, I'm sorry.  I do more than just watch the news.  I read a lot, I read a lot about the statistics across this country, and it's ridiculous.  It is ridiculous, the amount of violence going on in the black community.  And no one wants to address it head on.  They got to skirt the issue by piling up excuse after excuse in front of it, instead of just 
[02:35:00]  facing it and going, what the fuck are you people doing?  Jesus Christ.  You know who faces it head on, and I like, is Farrakhan.  I like Farrakhan.  Yeah, there you go.  Farrakhan, there's a lot of things he says I don't agree with.  I think he's way too radical.  But you know what?  He does, he's all, he's a conservative.  I hate to like, you know, shock people.  He talks about the, you know, family and all this crap.  He's, you know, he's completely critical of the violence in the black community.  I know he blames, I think he blames too much of it on white society.  But, you know, I like the guy. 
[02:35:30]  And it's not just, you know, black on white crime.  Black on black crime is amazing.  I am amazed by the amount of it.  You pick up the New York papers or read the news.  Every day.  In Brooklyn, there's another black guy laying in the street with a bullet in his head.  And there's a black guy that killed him.  And there's just this violence going on that I, I'm sorry.  And like I said, I read a lot about this.  I cannot figure out where it's coming from.  Where does it come from? 
[02:36:00]  300 years ago?  Is it really coming from that?  Is it honestly coming from that?  Is there so much racism in place now that any black person cannot really get ahead?  They're incapable of getting an education because they're blocked by racism.  They're incapable of getting jobs because they're blocked by racism.  Or is it the fact, and this is a fact, that if you're a black person and you've gone to school, you've gone to college, and you go out into the job market, that it is a given you are going to be given a good job? 
[02:36:30]  It absolutely is.  Because it's a rare commodity.  I don't know, man.  On this one, I've got to kind of play devil's advocate a little bit.  I think there's like a fine line.  Because black people do, like a lot of times, talk about institutionalized racism.  And I know the word racism is thrown around way too much.  But I don't think that it's like complete lunacy, that there is definitely very subtle things where they're passed over.  It's like, I think poverty does have something to do with people's behavior.  It's not like black people are just genetically, you know what I mean?  There's some kind of a poverty thing too that, I'm not making excuses for people because I think that they should be executed for killing this girl. 
[02:37:00]  But there is something to be said for the fact that you don't see a lot of middle class or people making X amount of money doing it.  It's mostly people that make shit.  There have been classes of people that have been impoverished over the years that pull themselves out of it.  As a culture, there are people that come here with nothing and pull themselves out of it.  There is something going on that is preventing black people from really, just as a whole, getting together as a group even. 
[02:37:30]  And really talking to each other about being successful in this country.  It's more about, you know, the hip-hop community.  And, you know, slinging fucking crack and all that gets more attention.  And more importance is put on that.  More importance is put a kid on the street, not about going to school and getting an education so you can get a better job.  It's about, hey, I'll shoot that motherfucker if he disrespects me. 
[02:38:00]  You bump into somebody and give him an eyeball the wrong way, and you're getting shot.  Where is that coming from?  I will say I agree with you that slavery is not an excuse.  One thing I'll say, again, devil's advocate, you know, had things gone differently after slavery,  I really think that this problem would have been something we just talked about that was over 100 years ago.  But, I mean, it really is like the last 30 years or 35 years that the scales have started to tip the other way.  I mean, there's a whole generation of people who are still alive that can remember legally being kicked off a bus.  I mean, it does do something, I think, to people's psyche when you've been shit on for so long. 
[02:38:30]  And, again, this is not the excuse, but I think you have to kind of weigh all options.  That does contribute on some level, I think, psychologically.  It's almost like women who grow up in an abusive household, they're not dumb.  They just go into an abusive relationship.  Well, maybe it's the same thing for a group that's constantly shit on and told them you're not protected equally under the law.  So how long, you think?  I honestly don't know.  I mean, a generation or two generations removed, I think there's got to be a certain amount of generations removed. 
[02:39:00]  And, again, had this been done a long time ago, I don't think we'd even be discussing this anymore.  All right, let's go to the phones, a couple phone calls, and then we'll move on.  Big Wash, what's up?  Hey, fellas, how you doing?  Pretty good.  I'm going to be in Norton.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, you know, I've got to agree with you.  I'm half black myself, and I just don't understand it.  I think that something comes from stupidity.  You know, you don't see white people acting like that.  You know, disrespecting me, I'm going to shoot you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:39:30]  I mean, look at it like this.  Why do black people get their own college?  You can only get in this college if you're black.  If white people had an all-white college, then it's racist.  You know, this is ridiculous.  It's out of hand.  And, you know, it's blamed on stupidity.  That's where I come from.  I'm so ashamed of being half black that, you know, if you look at me, you'd swear I'm white.  So, you know, that's what I go by.  I mean, it's sickening.  I'm going to punch out and listen to you guys. 
[02:40:00]  You guys are doing great.  Love to listen to you.  Keep up the good work.  All right, thanks, Big Wash.  I got to say, I agree with the whole double standard thing about white colleges and black.  You can say it's okay to say black but not white.  But, again, when you look at the history of white people and just around the world, look, we've been as violent.  I mean, we, I'm not German.  Look at Germany.  Well, look at the Russians.  I mean, they're as white as you can get.  And they have been barbarians.  Yeah.  I mean, just, you know, genocide.  So, it's not to say that white people don't have a disgraceful, awful history.  Of course.  You know, where the black people are only prone to violence but, you know. 
[02:40:30]  You're not addressing the entire world here.  No, no, no.  I'm just addressing.  People look at it like it's a racial thing.  Like, there are white supremacists who go, well, if you're black, you're more predisposed.  It's like, you know, come on.  You look at the history everywhere, everyone's been pretty much a creeper.  It's just disgusting when you pick up the paper on a daily basis and you just see the body count that's rang up.  It's ridiculous.  All right, one more.  Let's say hi to Jimmy.  What's up, Jimmy?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  You know what these videos that they make glorifies and deifies violence and makes these young kids think, well, I've got to get mine.  Yeah, but if you're going to get some, get a fucking education. 
[02:41:00]  Because nobody can take that away from you.  I don't mind the videos.  I love them.  I think it's more, you know, a reflection of what's going on than causing it.  Sure.  Yeah, but it glorifies it to an extent to make these kids want to take on these personas.  It's a fucking, it's an act.  It's fucking entertainment.  Well, they should be educated that this isn't the way of life.  This is entertainment.  You watch it not to be a role model.  You watch it to be entertained, you know?  But some people don't know how to draw that line.  Well, that's not the problem of what's being shown or listened to. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  You know, I'd be quite the hypocrite if I said, yeah, they ought to take away those hip-hop videos.  No, no, no.  But what I'm saying is, you know what it is?  It's parents that raise, but it's parents that have to raise their kids to watch these things and let them understand that it's entertainment and not a way of life.  Just like listening to this show is entertainment and, you know, you shouldn't do some of the stuff we discuss and people that play violent video games shouldn't run out and start shooting people.  It's, you know, it's education and it's parenting and those things. 
[02:42:00]  And I believe we can have a greater country if we all work together.  We can stop the violence.  Blacks, whites, Asians, Spanish.  We can all live together in this great land of ours.  And that is why today I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States of America. 
[02:42:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I...  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's very important...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We as a...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All thank you.  I believe. 
[02:43:00]  I have a vision.  Time for a sing-along, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Brothers, sisters, when this world began, there was work to be done, and it seems that someone left it to the colored man. 
[02:43:30]  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Robert, sisters, what must be, must be.  A big big play.  Though the balance is wrong, still your faith must be strong, except your destiny. 
[02:44:00]  Brothers, listen to me.  Brothers, listen to me.  Someone had to pick the cotton.  Someone had a plan for corn.  Someone had to slave and be able to sing. 
[02:44:30]  That's why doggies were born.  Someone had a laugh at trouble.  Oh, Jesus.  Though he was hard and worn.  Hard to be contented with any old thing.  Sing, that's why doggies were born. 
[02:45:00]  Sing, sing, sing when you're married.  Wow.  That's some number.  Who's singing that?  Believe it or not, Kate Smith.  Is that God Bless America, Kate Smith?  That's the God Bless America lady.  Wow.  Sing, sing.  Yeah, I think the climate has gotten a little better in this country.  I really think about it.  Yeah.  What is the title of that song?  Someone had to fight for that old devil. 
[02:45:30]  That's why doggies were born.  I thought about Gabriel's home.  Someone had to stoke that old train that would bring.  But chillin' to green pastures that the doggies were born. 
[02:46:00]  We've come a long way, man.  Yeah.  But it's not that far removed from where we are.  You know, time-wise, it's not that far removed.  That's why doggies were born.  That song was probably played on the radio back in the day.  Probably was.  It was acceptable.  And that was Kate Smith with That's Why Doggies Were Born.  Smoke Lucky.  Smoke Lucky Strike and listen to Kate Smith's rendition of That's Why Doggies Were Born. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Brutal.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're running real late here.  We have Laszlo.  We'll get him in next.  Poor Laszlo's been sitting up there.  I know.  Well, and we also have the audio of the teacher flipping out still to play.  Oh, yeah.  You have audio of that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is it...  Is it...  It's hard to understand, though, no?  Walk...  Oh, I'm stalking you.  The news plays a portion of what this kid taped on his cell phone. 
[02:47:00]  He has a video taped on his cell phone of this teacher flipping out because nobody was standing  during the National Anthem.  Good for the teacher.  Douchey kids, little spoiled jerk-offs.  Mom said I'm an individual.  I'm not standing.  All right.  Well, we'll get into that story and some other things next.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias. 
[02:47:30]  I had the yelling parents, too, growing up, until they got divorced.  And it was just, you know...  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it.  And it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there, horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you!  Get the fuck out of the wall!  Fuck you!  Oh, and the horrified kids.  Did that actually leave?  After the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep.  Because the yelling would stop.  First, Mom would have to wind down a little. 
[02:48:00]  That fucking asshole!  You know, even after Dad left, she's still going.  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head!  I'm trying to sleep!  He's gone!  Shut up!  I'm getting here!  Shut up!  That way!  Is that...  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like, the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down, watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing, everything was fine.  You know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd be like...  It's a fucking time for that, man!  It's a fucking time for that one!  And then you'd hear from the kids, like...  It's a fucking time for that one! 
[02:48:30]  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room, and  Mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with  you, we're divorced.  Oh, okay!  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does? 
[02:49:00]  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole!  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and  screaming.  No way!  Is that...  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Cuyas.  It's got to be, you're going to just sit there disgusted, having to listen to this crap. 
[02:49:30]  XM202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  I thought we had a long break that time.  No.  That's not a long break.  It's a longer break, but it's not a long break. 
[02:50:00]  Still short.  Still short.  Everyone back in the studio, we've got to figure out that problem.  Man, we've really got to, like, be able to step aside for five, six, seven minutes and  have the audience still entertained.  There's a way to do that, I'm sure.  Got to be.  If you want to...  I'm willing to go in there with Steve and run a tape of just my plugs.  You want to do seven minutes?  You already run those.  No, no, no.  But I'm saying the seven-minute loop of Baltimore Improv next Thursday through Sunday. 
[02:50:30]  Not this one, but the next one.  I don't know the dates.  I mean, I would do that for the show.  I personally don't care about people coming out.  Nice.  But if you guys need a break, dude, I'm about you guys.  I'm about you guys.  All right.  We've got to say hi to Jerry Ferrara.  He's on the hotline here.  Hey, Jerry.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on?  Where are you calling us from?  I'm in L.A. right now, in my house.  L.A., 6 a.m., calling the Opie and Anthony program.  Yep.  How thrilled are you?  What's going on?  So you're on that show, Entourage, right? 
[02:51:00]  Yep, yep.  On HBO?  Yes, I am.  Thank God.  What do you mean, thank God?  It's good to have a job, man.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It wasn't looking good for you for a while?  No, it's looking good, but, you know, it's definitely a rough business, man.  It's rough to actually get some steady work going.  Yeah, so you're happy you got a full-time job.  You know, I've never seen Entourage.  I've got to be honest with you.  Oh, it's all right.  Maybe explain the show a little bit?  Basically, the show is about an up-and-coming movie star who, you know, has maybe made like 
[02:51:30]  three or four movies from New York.  He's been living out in L.A., and he moves three of his best friends out from New York  and Queens, where he's from, and they all come out to L.A. and basically, you know,  start helping him run his career and his life, and, you know, one of the characters actually  becomes like his full-time manager, whereas my character is more like the party guy.  He loves getting the free stuff and, like, you know, rest over girls, and the other characters 
[02:52:00]  is half-brother, where they, like, share the same father who's actually been an actor  ten years before the younger brother came out, and then the younger brother came out and  made it famous, so he's kind of, you know, living off the younger brother's wave now,  and it's a funny story, man.  I know season one is coming out on DVD soon.  Yeah, I think it comes out, I believe, May 10th is coming out, and we're actually filming  the second season now.  We're about five episodes deep, and that should be back on in June.  Man, they don't even wait to put this stuff out on DVD these days, huh? 
[02:52:30]  Oh, no, it's literally, like, usually ready to go before the show, or even, like, movies  are done where, like, theaters are on the schedule.  It's ready to come out on DVD.  Wow.  What else have you been in?  I actually did a movie two months ago where I actually filmed.  I'm originally from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and I got the film in my old neighborhood.  It's a movie called Nailed Right In with me and Freddie Prinze Jr., Scott Kahn, Alec Baldwin,  me and Suvari, and it was a... 
[02:53:00]  You don't all go to the Verrazano Bridge and dance around on it, do you, and one guy falls  off, no?  We actually shot a scene, like, underneath the Verrazano Bridge where, when I was a kid,  we were scared to go over there because people used to tell us, like, a troll lived under  there.  Jesus.  No, that's just a homeless guy, bro.  I know.  I went there.  It was just a 4-foot-11 homeless guy.  You know, I ain't no troll.  But, dude, being from Brooklyn, though, man, it's always got to be, like, good to go home  because, you know, you move out to L.A., and all of a sudden you come home, and it's 
[02:53:30]  like, you know, I'm here now, and, you know, if I'm going to shoot something, then,  you know...  I mean, it was just an unbelievable thing to, like, you know, we filmed a scene where, like,  my house in the movie was, like, two blocks away from my mother's house.  Like, in between shots, I was going home and eating meatballs and getting, like, some  home cooking, which is definitely cool.  Do you like L.A.?  I always feel kind of weird when I go out there, being from the East Coast.  You know what?  I'm starting to like it now.  I've been out here for five years now.  When I first got out here, I hated it.  You know, just the people are different.  Like, bars and clubs close at, like, 2 in the morning. 
[02:54:00]  Like, it's just a whole different thing.  But, you know, I actually got, like, a decent routine in my own lifestyle.  I got all my friends I hang out with are from New York.  And everyone who I work with on the show is originally from New York.  And so it's a good way to kind of keep back home going when you're out here.  Yeah, sometimes it's best to hook up with the New Yorkers out there because that L.A.,  like, that West Coast mentality is just a little odd to get used to.  Yeah, it's just different.  They want to, you know, they want to raise like, you know, we were raised.  I'm not saying it's better or worse, but it's just different. 
[02:54:30]  Well, I'll say it.  It's better here.  And if it wasn't for New Yorkers going out there, that whole shitty state should fall into the ocean.  I'll say it.  It's one big earthquake and knock it right off the mat.  Weren't you just saying how you're starting to like L.A., Jimmy?  I am.  That was five minutes ago.  I am starting to like L.A.  Oh, all right.  Hey, Jerry, when you come back to New York, you hang out with old friends or something?  Or are they just like assholes?  Oh, yeah, I've had the same group of friends since I was a little kid.  And what are they doing, the same stuff?  I mean, it's definitely gotten less over the years. 
[02:55:00]  People go their own ways.  But, I mean, I got a good group of friends I consider family, you know?  Are you like the successful one and they're still like slapping all around Brooklyn?  Well, that's what some of them say.  Like, we always, you know, fuck around.  It's just like, you know, someone had to make it out of this neighborhood and it was you.  So, they always say they're going to come out and be my entourage.  Hey, you left us here with the fucking moolies, huh?  Where'd you go, you motherfuckers?  I also see that you were on an episode of NYPD Blue, man. 
[02:55:30]  That must have been really cool.  That show, I mean, as far as cops are concerned, I mean, it's just...  It was definitely cool to get on because, you know, they just finished up their whole, you know, run.  They had like an 11-year run or whatever it was.  And there's another friend of mine who's been on that show, the whole run.  And not on, like, every episode, I actually got to work with him in the NYPD Blue.  And they got it.  It is like a well-oiled machine over there, man.  I went in there and, like, I had a lot of stuff to do.  And they got me out of there in, like, three hours.  And they just know what they were doing. 
[02:56:00]  They were doing it for a long time.  It was definitely good to, like...  It's kind of a piece of history, you know.  When you get, like, a run like that, you know, you kind of...  Even if you could be involved in a little way, it's cool.  I bet you played the New York Italian guy.  How'd you guess, man?  How'd you guess?  Who does your friend play on the show?  He plays Officer Shannon.  Um...  Do I know Officer Shannon?  He pops in and out of there.  He had a few good episodes where...  Yeah, he's all right.  All I know was he ratted out in one episode.  And basically everyone in New York was calling him a rat.  He couldn't go back there for a little bit. 
[02:56:30]  Dude, I've only seen the first two seasons because these dumbbells won't release them all on DVD.  I got so addicted to it after the first and second season.  And then it's been, like, a year and season three won't come out.  Yeah, they're, like, the only ones who take their time.  I guess when you're that successful, you can.  But they take their time with the DVD release.  So there's a lot of money waiting for them to just put out the next nine seasons.  Yeah, you'll be...  Will you get any cash once your season comes out?  No, I mean, I only did, like, a few episodes.  I won't get rich off it, man, you know?  You'll get a quarter here, a quarter there.  Well, by the time these idiots put it out, you'll be collecting Social Security. 
[02:57:00]  That's true.  Jerry, do you get recognized from your entourage role?  You know what?  I do.  And we actually got, like, a running joke because on the show, I'm kind of, like, the most of, like, the hip-hop character.  And I always have, like, my hat on backwards.  And I'm dressing in, like, football jerseys and stuff.  So it's weird.  I don't really dress like that in real life.  So if I go out dressed normal with, like, a leather jacket and my hair, like, all ginzoed up, no one really would bother me.  But, like, if I put my hat back, it's like I have a uniform. 
[02:57:30]  And once I do that, people do recognize me a lot, man.  It's crazy.  When I was in high school, I'm 36.  I'm a little older than you.  This one, hip-hop was just kind of starting to be, like, really, really popular.  I was, like, the white kid that had the fat laces.  What an atrocious sight.  I had a Kango hat, a fur Kango.  I actually went into wardrobe the other day.  And there was a pair of sneakers that had, like, four fat laces on.  And I didn't even know how to get those things on.  Oh, they're awful.  I should have hung myself with them.  That's what they're good for, man. 
[02:58:00]  You can definitely get that job done quick.  Yeah, right on.  All right, Jerry.  Well, good luck to you.  May 10th.  I appreciate it.  Entourage Season 1 DVD, May 10th.  And new episodes starting when?  I believe the first Sunday in June.  In June.  Don't quote me on that, but definitely June.  All right, now I'm going to go check out Entourage on HBO.  You definitely should.  I think you guys would love it.  It would be right up your alley.  All right, Jerry.  Good luck to you, buddy.  Have a good one, guys.  All right, see you, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  There he goes, Jerry Ferrara.  I didn't even know it was on HBO.  Oh, cool.  Brooklyn in the hizzy.  Brooklyn! 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, we'll get Laszlo in in a second, Ben.  Relax.  What's the matter, Ben?  You all right?  Ben's really producing the hell out of the show lately.  I know.  And he's doing a great job.  And, you know, he's getting more herky and jerky every day.  All the comments on the websites about some of the video, because some of the video went  up on Foundry, the...  Bernie Getz?  No, LA video.  Oh, okay.  And they were like, how can you look at Ben without taking motion sickness medicine?  Because the guy, there's some clip of you where you're herkying and jerkying  so much, people can't believe it. 
[02:59:00]  They cannot believe how much...  I didn't see it.  Yeah.  It's like a rare video.  Ben moves like he's starting the ring.  Yeah.  Not really.  You can exaggerate this, Jim.  That jerky, jerky video technique.  And he's over there looking at my dick.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, you are.  I've seen that many times.  Dude, we all do.  It's almost like saying you're looking at the side of that barn when you're facing it.  But I was actually...  Most of us look, because we're trying to figure it out.  No, what I was looking at when he said that, I'll be honest.  I was looking at the way his shirt is too short, because Ben lost a lot of weight, 
[02:59:30]  but his little gut is pushing his shirt out, and it's just touching the top of his belt.  So it's almost like his shirt is too short.  You really look too far into guy's stuff.  Dude, I'm just commenting on it.  Not at all.  Yeah, you do.  I'm wearing an Aussie shirt.  In the men's room with you, you always check out everyone's dick.  I tried to check yours out.  I couldn't see you.  You were protecting it.  You like to go to the bathroom with other guys.  What am I supposed to go?  With ladies?  Ladies, I'd rather go.  Believe me, if I had the option of urinating while I laid under a girl who was tingling,  I'd take that option.  You and that big, delicious treat. 
[03:00:00]  Ben, you want to come over to my house?  Not an animal.  Email me.  Listeners have been emailing him.  Of course.  Be nice to Wheelchair Fred if you email him, because for real nice.  We do like Fred.  No, I'm serious.  I'm serious.  The guy is in hell.  He's living in hell.  Wheeler Durf.  Wheeler Durf.  At AOL.com.  Yeah.  We've got to get him laid, man.  Especially if you live in, I think, the Framingham area, Massachusetts, and you want to go, 
[03:00:30]  ah, what the hell, I'll bang Fred.  Oh.  He'll go for it.  Anything out there with genitals.  That's the beauty of Fred.  Man, woman, doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Yeah.  When we're in Boston, which we'll announce soon, we'll have Fred come.  And then, which one of you guys picked him up out of the wheelchair that time?  What?  We did all sorts of stuff.  No, is it?  No.  I made him walk.  The most famous.  The most famous one.  That should be a chapter in our book because, wow, Anthony and I, I'm not even kidding you. 
[03:01:00]  We almost got killed.  Yeah, they were mad.  They were really mad.  I tried doing a faith healer thing.  He's not paralyzed.  His legs just screwed up so he can't stand in the chair.  And we've seen him kind of hold himself up.  He holds himself up with his arms.  And I was in front of a big crowd at a club and said, you are healed, Fred.  And the crowd was going crazy because he started getting up out of the chair.  And they thought he was paralyzed.  I knew better.  And he stands up.  And I take the chair away.  And I go, now walk.  And he just fell flat on his face.  He takes the mic stand down with him.  He made a crash.  And the audience went from applauding in disbelief that I was like the Savior, Jesus Christ, 
[03:01:30]  to let's kill those motherfuckers that just made this poor guy fall on his face.  All the stuff we just handed out, like CDs and stuff, they started throwing at us.  Started throwing back.  Hard, dude.  Classic.  Well, what happened was Fred got up.  And he was basically teetering.  He wasn't able to stand on his own.  So he grabbed the nearest thing, which was the mic stand.  Yeah.  Which obviously wasn't anchored down.  Oops.  And the whole thing, bam!  Flat on his face.  In hindsight, he was probably going to stick it up his ass.  Yeah, there you go.  In Boston, they were probably just mad because he wasn't black and you didn't push him. 
[03:02:00]  Rotten creeps up there.  It was quite a scene, man.  Chris in Jersey.  What's up, Chris?  Chris?  Jersey?  Yeah, you, bro.  No, I'll call my book.  All right, what's up?  No, I'm just glad to hear you guys back on the air.  I had no clue you guys were back on.  I caught your banner ad on the website.  And, you know, from tooling around to foundry to whack bag,  the guy, you know, got to hold the number and had to call you.  There's still a lot of our old faithful listeners that just don't know we're back for some reason. 
[03:02:30]  There's so many of us.  We talk in the chat on the website, and it's just, it's ridiculous.  Oh, cool.  Well, spread the word for us, because we're really trying to get the word out that we're back.  Listen, can I give a plug for the website?  I mean, they're the ones that got me to you.  Which website?  Mafialife.com, man.  Oh, Mafialife?  Yeah, listen.  All right.  These guys talk you up left and right, man.  I had to sign up for XL immediately.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  I got myself a unit for the car.  I'm just doing it on the computer for now.  Well, there's going to be 10 units available soon in Florida when this tool bag cancels all of his truck ones. 
[03:03:00]  Maybe you can pick one of those up.  Florida, man.  I'm up north, man.  I'm in the snow with you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Jim, you're going to rock, man.  Thank you, Angel.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Do we have time to play this teacher audio?  He said he's from Carmel, like we know.  No, Carmel.  Not Jersey.  Carmel.  Where is Carmel?  There are many of them around this country.  I'm sure you can pop up one in California.  Clint Eastwood was mayor, right?  Right.  Carmel, California.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Talks about it like it's, you know, hey, I'm from Manhattan.  Yeah, Carmel.  Yeah.  Okay, well, we got the teacher audio. 
[03:03:30]  What's the story on this?  Just an angry teacher.  We've all had him.  This isn't even news.  It's kind of funny to hear him yelling, but who didn't have a teacher like this?  He was all pissed off at the students for not standing up during the pledge.  He just sounds like one of those angry guys that he's an older gentleman that's got to  be around young people all day, and he's pissed off at that, you know?  Is he an ex-military, I wonder?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know the background.  Maybe we could, I don't know.  Maybe we should read before the show.  Ah, screw that.  That reading's overrated, though.  Reading.  Reading sucks.  But I guess one of the kids didn't want to stand for the, a bunch of the kids in the 
[03:04:00]  class didn't want to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem.  But it wasn't even, it wasn't, don't let it be confused with them trying to make a statement  or something, and this is going to turn into some big issue.  They were just fucking with their teacher.  Yeah.  That was it.  They found something that annoyed them and did it.  They could care less.  Stand, don't stand.  And then one kid had a, what, a video phone?  Yeah.  There's a video all over the news now.  It recorded the guy's rant.  Yeah.  He kicked out somebody's chair who wouldn't stand up for the Pledge, so he kicked the chair 
[03:04:30]  out from right under him.  And they also said something about that during certain tirades, he'd take a hammer and start  banging it on their desk in the classroom if they weren't paying attention.  One of those madman teachers, though.  Yeah, we've all had one.  We've all had.  I love them already.  Yeah.  Noah's great when you're growing up and you're in grammar school and you always had that  one idiot that didn't want to stand, or it was against his religion or something.  Religion.  Which, whatever, man.  And then the teacher had to, like, escort that kid out just before the Pledge of Allegiance.  Making a disturbance.  And that kid never made friends because of that.  No.  He was always that guy. 
[03:05:00]  Good job.  That's the guy that has that weird religion.  You know?  Isn't it our time, Mr. Hand?  Yeah, exactly.  Is that what individuality has become?  People think that makes you an individual because you don't want to honor the country you're in?  It's like, that's how unoriginal people are.  That's the best they can do.  That's it.  And, you know, the kid didn't know any different.  It was the stupid parents that, you know, put their children in that circumstance.  And then, you know, that same kid has to go to school every day with all the kids looking  at him like, look, man, you're a freak. 
[03:05:30]  We don't want to hang out with you.  Can somebody give up, like, those little fuzzy dice to hold?  Or something soft like cotton balls?  Something that makes no noise.  I know.  I'm reading instant feedback.  How about some shot glasses, Hawk?  Stop it.  Look, it's not my fault today.  I wasn't even going to pick up these poker chips, but...  He hands you the loudest things in the studio.  I know, but birthday boy, just before the show starts, you know, he sets up the whole  studio for us, gets everything nice and ready, and then the last thing he does is hands me  a pile of poker chips.  Hey, don't play with these.  You're just a few bricks and some plate glass. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, there you go.  Here comes rage.  Wheel over the anvil and hammer for Opie.  Let's hear the audio of this teacher.  I want to hear a sound, not a sound.  Word and exercise will come on.  You will stand.  You will stand quietly.  You will pay attention.  Any questions?  No, sir.  Smart-ass little bastard.  The best part of this...  Oh, sir, the laughing.  The best part of this is you hear the kids just giggling.  They're laughing at him at the beginning. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, this guy is kind of a tool.  You little scumbag!  No, it sounds like Bobby Knight.  You got that Bobby Knight?  We'll play that going into break.  Yeah, let's continue.  Now stand up and keep the mouth shut!  This is the best footage ever.  Wait, what?  He goes, this is the best footage ever.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because he knows he's got it on tape.  Oh, I got to hear that again. 
[03:07:00]  The dude's loving it.  Oh, yeah.  Let me go back.  Here we go.  This is the best footage ever.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody's just happy to sing along now.  Oh, God.  All scared.  Oh, so proudly we are.  Looking around, making sure the teacher's not going to come after him.  That's insane.  Why didn't they just play, that's why darkies were born? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  Stand up, kid.  Stand up!  Come on.  Get off!  I don't have to stand up.  You have to stand.  No, I don't.  Are you kidding me?  Stand. 
[03:08:00]  Are you serious?  I am damn well serious.  Holy shit.  Go over.  You're going to seriously take a chair from underneath me?  This is the best.  This is the best.  Wow.  These kids are just laughing at this jackass.  They're laughing.  They're cursing.  I hear the guy, he obviously kicked a chair out, right, or something?  The kid wouldn't get up, so in the video, you see he kicks the legs out because the kid's 
[03:08:30]  hanging halfway off the chair.  He kicks the legs out.  And the kid's about, he grabs the desk before he falls down.  Do you believe, like, he's saying shit and fuck?  Would you ever do that to a teacher?  To a teacher?  To a teacher back then?  Oh, my God, no.  It was just not done.  Nope.  Now he's like, are you kidding me?  No.  I'm not standing up.  Fuck.  Wow.  The kid is a little douche, but he is really a little douchebag.  Why would the teacher care?  It's like, you've got to realize you're dealing with little scumbags.  Just stand yourself, and who cares what they do? 
[03:09:00]  They're irrelevant.  Yeah.  Hopefully they'll be shot in robberies.  What's the big deal?  You know, as a teacher, you educate them, but if that's their idea of rebellion, let them  rebel.  Who cares?  They're meaningless.  Who cares?  All right.  Well, it reminds us of this fine.  That guy's angry.  Piece of audio from Bobby Knight.  That's that type of teacher that always ended up getting something put in his coffee by  the end of the year, you know?  Because he's just like one of those miserable old bastards.  Not the fun teacher.  You want to hear beauty?  We had a teacher like that.  He wasn't a yeller, but everybody hated him, because he always smelled like cigarettes, 
[03:09:30]  and he was just a rotten curmudgeon, and then he got busted with a prostitute and got  fired.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, social study teacher.  You've got to respect that.  Yeah.  All right.  You all right?  I'll prove him.  Yeah.  Fine.  Here's the audio of Bobby Knight in the locker room.  I just want to play that I'm getting the fuck out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover Greg Graham, if you're just going to let him drive  by you, if the rest of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second 
[03:10:00]  lane and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him, then I'm leaving and  you fucking guys will run until you can't even suffer.  Now, I'm tired of this shit.  I'm sick and fucking tired of an 8-10 record.  I'm fucking tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to fuck around this week.  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  Now, I'm going to fucking guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, you're  going to believe in the next four fucking days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday.  Now, you better fucking understand that right now. 
[03:10:30]  Now, this is absolute fucking bullshit.  Now, I'll fucking run your ass right into the ground.  I mean, I'll fucking run you.  You'll think last night was a fucking picnic.  I had to sit around for a fucking year with an 8-10 record in this fucking lake.  And I mean, you will not put me in that fucking position again, or you will goddamn pay for  it like you can't fucking believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Who needs that?  Man, to sit there and just get yelled at like that. 
[03:11:00]  And these are all, like, tough, like, athletes who would probably smash your face in a second.  And I would not open my mouth to that fucking psychopath.  Yes, sir.  Yep.  Get your ass handed to you.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  I'll choke you.  Yeah, I know exactly what that score is.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And the people around there, wow, we're talking a bunch of winners.  What happened to the phone?  It's such a white trash type of area. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah?  Where is it?  Uh, brick.  Oh, Jersey?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Yeah, no problem.  I got distracted by the phone.  By the way, the phones have been acting up off and on all day.  A little.  A couple of calls.  Oh, we're trying to be cool.  Yep.  Do they have a minute, Ted?  Well, oh, that's great.  That's how you want them.  Not as bad.  Oh, poker chips.  Someone get an open clock drop?  I gotta...  You sure?  No, I'm fine.  Let's get Laszlo in here.  A little vapor.  It's an upper respiratory infection. 
[03:12:00]  Upper respiratory infection?  Upper respiratory infection.  I told you to take echinacea.  Besides that, I'll be fine.  Echinacea.  What are these?  What is that?  Oh, thanks.  Hi, Laszlo.  Hello.  Nice.  What's up, man?  Yo, yo.  What do you got?  Laszlo in the house.  You might know Laszlo from the Grand Theft Auto games.  Of course.  It's getting worse.  Gary.  Gary.  Dude, Master Poe is the real deal, man. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, my God.  I always wondered what the story was with him, but yesterday it came to full light.  Yeah.  You gotta get a panic button, though, dude, because that delay is...  Oh, with a little light.  That delay is...  Oh, the whole Bernie Getz incident?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You know, that would be good to have a button with a little red light in there that goes  off that he can see.  Yeah, he's asking me, he's like, do you have a shank in your rectum?  He's showing me Rorschach blots.  Have you ever had any violent tendencies toward people in radio?  The guy, yeah, he makes sure everybody's psychological profile before they come in here. 
[03:13:00]  I think we should have two different buttons, though, like one yellow, which means, eh,  it's a little odd, and one red, which means...  Because you don't want him running...  He's a psychopath, and he was really pissed.  You don't want to...  We need the kill thing, where it's like, you come in here and just start killing people.  Yeah, I don't think people understand how crazy he got in here yesterday.  You know, listening to him on the radio is one thing, but we were trying to calm down  Bernie.  Then we had to calm down Poe, because we thought Poe was going to kill Bernie.  It was just a cluster F.  He had that look in his eye, that killer look in his eyes, and it was frightening to see. 
[03:13:30]  It was hot.  It was hot.  A little man taking charge.  And then Ant and I were just laughing at the whole scene.  Yeah.  After I knew that Bernie was going to be...  Yeah, he went psycho, but he wasn't going to do any real damage.  It just became really funny, and then I was like...  I wasn't sure of that until he left.  Well, the scariest part about yesterday was when he ran out of the studio saying...  What was the last thing he said?  He said, keep the fucking CD.  I'm not coming back here.  Fuck you.  You won't see me here or something like that.  And then he runs off into a cubicle where he had his stuff, and that's when we all went, 
[03:14:00]  what does he have in that bag?  Picked up the black bag, and I'm like, oh, here comes the gun.  And I was like, oh, so I was supposed to be on the show tomorrow, and now there's going  to be no more show, because they're all going to be dead.  We're going to be shot dead here.  How do you think I felt, thinking that Ope was going to get shot, and I got gigs to plug?  Ah, you guys would just move on.  We certainly would not.  Sex Bagel and Anthony show.  I like it.  You guys would have been fine.  Bernie's sitting there.  They would have just hosed down the studio, and all they'd have to do is listen to the  clip, and they'd acquit Bernie. 
[03:14:30]  So obviously, Ope's being an ass that deserved to be shot for what he did.  Welcome to the Shannon and Anthony show.  Oh, hey.  That's got a ring to it.  You know, since you were talking about the history of race relations, I actually have something  on me, it's money used to buy people.  Wow.  I was in Oklahoma a week ago, and they're really into the heritage, not hate, or whatever.  Slavery memorabilia.  Yeah, I went to this store, and I saw it.  It was like a deer in the headlights.  I had to buy it.  It's a $20 bill from the Confederate States of America. 
[03:15:00]  Is it real, or is it a replica?  It's real.  So, I started kind of looking around at stuff, and some of the bills that they had had slaves  on them.  Oh, really?  Picking cotton.  This stuff's amazing.  Can you spend this?  How old is this?  That's 1863.  How much was it?  Like 50 bucks.  That's it?  Wow.  Let me see that after you answer.  I wonder how many...  How much was that worth?  What's wrong with you? 
[03:15:30]  Why?  I didn't say a word.  I want to know how much that was.  How many dollars is that worth, like, by today's standards?  How much was that worth?  Confederate States, 20 bucks, 1863.  Wow, yeah, look at that.  That's cool, man.  Yeah.  You know, down there, maybe they should put Bernie Goetz on the $20 bill in the South.  I think they would enjoy...  Although, he's a Yankee, you know?  Yeah, but still.  Something like that.  He's got that heritage, not hate vibe down there.  Yeah.  And, you know, guys like Bernie, dime a dozen down there.  Yeah.  He's a svelte northerner with glasses and questionable sexual preferences that wouldn't care for him. 
[03:16:00]  Dude, if you want some interesting radio, turn on the radio in Oklahoma, man.  There's, like, five Christian stations.  Oh, those things are freaky.  And they're just guys preaching.  And there's these guys, like, you know who made this world?  Who runs it now?  It's the devil.  He runs the TV, the radio, and especially the Internet.  And I'm like, oh, great, you know, because I do a syndicated radio feature about the Internet.  This guy's going to give me some juice.  He goes, you know the Internet's run by the devil because, you know, one minute you're just starting to check your email. 
[03:16:30]  And the next thing you know, you're typing a word into a search engine that you shouldn't be thanking, much less typing.  It's not a point.  Well, he's kind of right.  And I was like, so I'm thinking, what is this preacher typing into the search engine?  Yeah, what is he doing?  He's never talking about his own experiences.  And he's saying devil, but he's mouthing to the congregation, choose, choose by devil. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, man.  The white devil.  That is funny.  So, Laszlo, what have you been up to, man?  That's the big 10-year anniversary of the technophile.  Oh, really?  Yeah, 10 years ago I started.  10 years ago they starred Yahoo, too, I just noticed on the tube.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's Yahoo's 10-year anniversary.  Yeah, meanwhile, they're all millionaires.  Yeah, right?  What happened?  What's techno?  What is it?  The technophile, it's a daily 60-second technology news feature.  That's the reason I was at the Consumer Electronics Show out there.  But it started here in New York and then went nationwide. 
[03:17:30]  It's on XM.  Yeah.  So it's on, like, you know, CNN, Fox, a bunch of the different stations it's on.  But it's been an interesting ride.  I mean, radio's gotten suckier, and it's harder to get it on stations, terrestrial radio.  Yeah.  Um, just, and there's so many talented people in this industry that have just jumped ship  and just said, I'm done.  Oh, yeah, regular radio.  Well, yeah, they can't be bothered anymore.  Please. 
[03:18:00]  Can't be bothered by the bullshit.  Who can sit there and just be chastised on a daily basis about what you're talking about  and what you can't talk about?  It's ridiculous.  To come here to XM and just be able to say whatever we want is great.  Well, this is the last run for us.  No, I'm dead serious.  As soon as this is over, done.  Retired.  There's no real reason to continue.  Well, it's like the storytelling potential of radio's gone.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just, it's like a guy giving away tickets to a shitty concert and then playing  some shitty music. 
[03:18:30]  That's it.  Yeah, there's no sitting there and talking and having an exchange with the listeners.  Or painting, like, one of the things that I really dug about, you know,  doing all the radio for the Grand Theft Auto stuff, is it was like, I was sort of doing  old-time radio, but in a modern way.  You know, it was like those old-time phantom, you know, cowboy westerns that were on the  radio, but, you know, we were doing current versions of them with whatever, you know,  hookers and things.  Speaking of GTA, someone has a question.  Brian, what's up? 
[03:19:00]  Brian.  Yo, hey.  Let's go.  I was just wondering on Grand Theft Auto, what channel you guys are on?  Well, we do a couple call-ins, and I think you have to be literally on the last mission  to hear us.  No, you have to be on the last third of the game to hear you guys.  Last third of the game, and you get to hear what Ant and I did for Grand Theft Auto San  Andres.  I heard a clip.  And I have to say, of all the people that I worked with, you guys were the lowest maintenance  dudes.  Oh, we're easy.  So many people in the entertainment industry.  It's like you've got to call some guy's faggoty, you know, sidekick personal assistant. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, dude, it's just like, and when Straylo, he's like, oh, here's their cell phone numbers.  I'm like, yo.  Yeah, just call us.  We're happy to be there.  That's it.  I get you guys on the phone.  I've got a caller ID.  If I don't want to talk to you, I'm not answering.  Who was talking about remote control helicopters?  Oh, yeah, man.  Yeah.  I got into that for a while, dude.  Talk about an expensive hobby.  Every time you crash, you're like, great, $500.  I know.  Believe me.  And when you're first learning how to do it, it's crazy because you're going to trash it. 
[03:20:00]  It's just a known thing.  You're buying this machine knowing that at some point you're going to have to replace some parts,  and hopefully it won't be as expensive as you think it's going to be.  I had one where it tailed in on me.  I was trying to do these.  At first, you're just buzzing around, tail facing you so you're not confused with the controls.  And then after a while, I'm doing these passes in front of me.  Just kind of wah, wah, wah, back and forth, back and forth.  Then I figured I'm going to do these climbs and then tip it over so it comes nose straight down and pull out of that. 
[03:20:30]  And it's almost like this seesaw motion that the helicopter is doing.  I get it up there.  It's facing nose up to the sky.  It starts coming back down backwards, and I just lose all orientation.  And I'm looking at this thing going, here it is, a lawnmower just, I don't know where it's going to land.  It's a lawnmower spinning in the sky coming down on people.  Hey, great.  It swooped in front of me.  Mr. Morrill, look out. 
[03:21:00]  Vic, duck.  Yeah.  Did you have electric or gas?  Gas.  And it was actually gas powered.  It wasn't the glow fuel.  So it was gasoline powered.  I'd start up by pulling it like you would a lawnmower.  This thing's just wah, winding.  I finally got it just barely leveled out and slowed down a bit before the tail boom hit.  And when the boom hits, you're replacing a lot of stuff.  And that was expensive.  I had electric ones, and I would get high and fly them in the house. 
[03:21:30]  Are you serious?  I swear to God.  And my girl's upstairs, and I'm down.  Because I bought this house by the beach and put like a recording studio on the bottom floor,  and there's like a kitchen, and I kind of like live upstairs.  And so I'm down there whacked with this like helicopter flying around the kitchen,  and then I completely lose control of it.  And there's like rotor blade shrapnel flying.  And I hear this from upstairs.  What the hell was that?  Don't come downstairs.  It's like a little scene from Apocalypse Now where the Asian girl threw the grenade at her. 
[03:22:00]  Say, bitch, I'm going to run up her ass.  Oh, man.  And they run so nice and smooth until they hit something.  And then it's just, yeah, they come apart at the seams.  I bought one of the turbine jet engine ones, too.  So I would take that out into the park across the street from my apartment in Brooklyn.  And meanwhile, you're not supposed to have anyone near any of these things.  And it would be a relatively slow day at the park, maybe a couple of people walking around the track. 
[03:22:30]  And I wasn't taking it up that high.  But when you kick this thing over, and it sounds and smells like LaGuardia, people are just, they want to gather around and look.  And meanwhile, the exhaust coming out of the thing is like 10,000 degrees.  And I'll be going to stick.  Keep the kids away.  Keep the dogs away trying to fly this, you know, very expensive piece of machinery around.  So it's a lot of fun, but, yeah, definitely not for the person on a budget. 
[03:23:00]  So I forgot to tell, one of the things I forgot to tell you guys about when I was on the show in Vegas was this one booth had binoculars.  And you've got to understand, a lot of these technology shows have Asian guys at the booths.  They fly them all the way over.  They can't speak like a lick of English.  And I go up to try to get a little sound bite about their crazy technology thing.  And, you know, I can't understand a word they're saying.  This guy's got binoculars that are, it's an MP3 player inside.  So I start goofing on him.  I'm like, you know, can you like, maybe market them, you know, while you're stalking your ex-girlfriend, we'll load all your, like, favorite songs on there. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, what the hell is a binocular?  How often do you need to look at?  They're throwing the MP3s and everything now.  Everything, yeah.  It's getting kind of silly.  So I'm like, you know, think about the potential of rifle scopes with MP3 players in it.  Oh, there you go.  You know, for, like, the anti-abortion folks, you could put some, like, hymns and stuff in there.  Really get inspired before you take out a doctor or something.  Nice. 
[03:24:00]  That's thinking.  To load Kate Smith into that.  That's why darkies were born.  Oh.  Now, you've been doing the show for 10 years, you said?  Yeah.  Does anything stick out in your mind as one of those technologies or some gadget that you looked at, maybe thought it was going to fly, and just kind of never took off in the 10 years?  No, my problem was, is I always said when stuff was stupid and wasn't going to fly.  Really?  And then, you know, people get all mad at me because I wasn't, you know, there's so many... 
[03:24:30]  You got a good track record with it?  Yeah.  Or did you make some real mistakes?  No, I'd say a lot of stuff.  MP3 players.  Hold on.  I was going to say iPod.  iPod.  I think not.  I think it's a joke.  I was looking at a report that I did in 98, and it was about an MP3 player that would hold 16 songs.  16 songs.  Wow.  I was like, oh, you've got to be kidding me.  They still sell them?  No.  I don't even have that.  It's binoculars.  It's in the binoculars now.  Put your prom special music in there.  It is so cool to look at some of the old computer magazines and technology and popular mechanics 
[03:25:00]  and popular science and look at some of the stuff from 10 years ago and go, wow.  They were making a big fuss over this, and it just went nowhere, where this got a little  mention, and it became like everything.  There was so much cockamamie stuff during the dot-com boom.  Yeah.  You know, people would make some money on the stock market, and they would turn around just like  there in Vegas and throw it down on the next day.  Let it ride.  Right.  You know, I had friends that were like, you know, my age.  You know, they were like 23 at the time. 
[03:25:30]  Like, I'm a millionaire.  I'm like, no, you're not, dude.  No.  No.  You're really not.  You're really not.  And trust me, in a couple of years, this is all going to come crumbling down.  But, yeah, any money I made during the dot-com days, I just shoved into real estate.  I did the, like, Bob Hope method of, because that's how he made his money.  I read about that.  That's how he's affording houses on the beach, to fly model helicopters inside.  Very good.  Yeah.  Wait, oh, the dot-com, you were involved with that, but you saved all your cash.  Well, I was a spokes dude for, like, MindSpring and then Earthlink, where they kind of paid 
[03:26:00]  me to do news reports and, like, sponsored news reports.  They were huge during the dot-com.  Yeah, they were big.  But I bought a crib instead of, you know, buying a bunch of stock and garbage.  I'm going to make even more money.  It's going to be great.  Didn't you do a big stock?  Oh, I used to do it all the time.  Day trading?  Day trader like a maniac.  You were doing it during the show, weren't you?  During the show.  People don't believe that that was going on.  I'm telling you.  I'd have my E-Trade account opened up on one of the computers, and I'd be trading an open 
[03:26:30]  look over and go, oh, my God, he's trading.  We would be getting into some crazy thing, just, you know, ranting and raving, and I'm  like, I just got to get out of this.  And all of a sudden, my options expire today.  I would be going off for, like, five minutes, and then all of a sudden I'd look at Anthony  and I'd go, oh, my God, he's not even listening.  No joke.  I was like, holy crap.  He's thinking about the yacht he's going to buy.  Yeah, that's it.  Well, I see him at the keyboard, and I'm thinking he's, you know, surfing the net to get more  info on this person or this story or maybe reading feedback or something. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, no.  He was trying to get in and out of stocks.  The connections were slow, so I put the sell order in, and I'm like, oh, come on, dump it.  I'm seeing the price fall.  Sell.  Trying to buy Endicott steel.  I could dump the stock just to burn your ass.  Anthony, how much were you up at one point?  I was up to $95,000 on my E-Trade account.  Day trading, guys.  I had turned just, you know, minimal money into $95,000.  It was, there was one trade. 
[03:27:30]  I was trading, I was on vacation at Disney World, and I was trading in the hotel room.  On the little Mickey computer.  Yeah.  And, you know, again, dial-up connection.  You know, it wasn't with hotels with high-speed internet anymore, you know.  It was a chore just to get online.  And I had to go through, like, AOL and then on to E-Trade.  So it was a real pain in the ass.  I'm trying to get this sell order in.  I think I made, like, $26,000 just sitting at Disney.  Wow.  It was, you had to be retarded not to make money during that whole boom. 
[03:28:00]  But you had to know when to get out.  But you had to know when to get out, and that was the problem.  I had had, like, $95,000.  I heavied up on everything again.  And this was somewhere around March, April.  And nothing came back.  Nothing.  Could you have just sold it and said, look, I'd like a check?  How does that work?  Oh, yeah.  It was just, it was in my E-Trade account.  It's cash.  I could write a check with it.  But at the end of the story, Anthony lost it all.  Yeah.  It was gone.  And then some, I think.  It was a world of the story.  What's great is people loved that rush of day trading.  It was fun.  And now they're playing online poker. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  I do the same now.  Well, that's his latest fix.  That's my new fix.  Laszlo, it's just a matter of time before he starts doing it during the show.  No, I won't do it during the show.  Oh, yes, you will do.  I'm sitting out there watching you, and you're talking to guests and surfing the web.  You're, like, a multitask guy.  I'm constantly checking stuff out.  It'll get to a point.  I mean, Anthony keeps pretty much calling in every day.  He's that good.  And eventually, he's just going to start, like, taking little peeks, little peeks, and  the next thing you know, he's going to get the bug to do it during the show. 
[03:29:00]  The thing about the poker is you've got to really concentrate on what you're doing, or you just  lose your money.  You've got to be very well disciplined, look, assess each hand of what everybody's doing.  So it's not one of those things you could do during the show.  Yeah.  It'd be really rough.  How come it won't, I tried to join up, actually.  I'm probably glad I didn't as an addict, but it won't take your credit card or whatever.  Some credit cards aren't accepted.  You've got to go through some other means, which is, like, you sign up for one of their  credit cards that you then finance with one of your credit cards, and then you use that.  There's a lot of safety involved. 
[03:29:30]  It's a good thing, because it would be very hard for them to rip off an account.  Well, and Ashcroft fought real hard to, you know, pressuring banks not to, you know, let  people use their credit cards on those accounts.  But it has, the online poker craze, there are so many people betting online now that there's  actually rumblings in the government to try to block it even more by telling internet  service providers that they have to start blocking casinos offshore.  I was wondering what they're going to do about this, because, you know, U.S. law ends at 
[03:30:00]  the borders, and a lot of these companies are offshore, they're in other countries, and  it's very hard to regulate that.  That's why, I mean, there is gambling going on in every city, in every state in this country  right now.  Whether it's legal or not, people are playing poker for money against other people in their  houses.  And there really doesn't seem to be much that the government can do about it.  They should just tax it.  Tax it.  Make your money.  Make the money. 
[03:30:30]  People are going to bang hookers, smoke weed, and gamble.  Yeah.  Tax it.  That's it.  We'd be done.  Well, how about this government?  Instead of gambling, how about you put all that nonsense effort and stop people who are  trafficking child pornography?  Why don't you focus more of your energy there?  Who gives a shit?  If people want to sit home and lose their money, that's their business.  Hey, what about people that like both of those things?  I do.  Believe me.  Believe me.  I'm not judging.  Both illegal activities.  Why not?  Right?  Hey. 
[03:31:00]  You sicko.  Let's go to that.  If poker doesn't leave a little ribbon on your...  Let's stop before I say it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Effie and see if this is true.  Effie, what do you have, man?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Glad to hear you back.  But it was a case where a guy was flying in a smoke control helicopter, and it actually  went back into the stands, and it actually cut somebody's head clean off.  Yeah, there was a story.  Is this true?  Yeah, this is true.  How about that one?  I know there was one in Texas when I first started getting into the hobby, and some guy 
[03:31:30]  was training some other guy where you have two remote controls.  They're wired together, and at any point, the guy that knows what he's doing can take  over from the guy that doesn't know what he's doing.  It's like a little safety co-pilot thing.  So the pro takes the helicopter up and then hands off to the guy that doesn't know what  he's doing, who pulls back on the stick.  The helicopter thrusts backwards right into the guy that knew what he was doing's head. 
[03:32:00]  How big is it?  These things are very, very big.  I mean, like as wide as you can stretch your arms.  I have a jet-powered scale one that is, I mean, from me to you over there.  Oh, wow.  The wing is that big?  Five feet, yes.  Six feet long.  It's just huge.  Ridiculous.  They look like real helicopters.  They sound like real helicopters.  It's amazing.  But this just, you know, huge blade.  Wham!  Guy right in the head.  Have you flown that particular helicopter yet?  No, not that one.  You build these things, and I'm afraid to fly it because you spend so much time. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  It's like, I don't want to fly.  I'm going to trash this thing.  So I figure I'll practice on the gas one a little more, you know.  But I trashed that one, and I rebuilt it, and I haven't taken it out to test it and stuff  after I rebuilt it.  So who knows if it's even going to fly right anymore.  Like I said, very expensive.  So you got any other gadget talk here?  Well, anything that's coming out there?  Oh, you were asking about stuff in the past 10 years.  Yeah, yeah.  There was this one guy that had computers that smell, and it has this device inside. 
[03:33:00]  I kind of remember reading about that.  Yeah.  You're right.  That was going to, like, mix a bunch of certain chemicals.  And so supposedly while you're playing a game that, you know, with the wheels burning  out.  Oh, you smell the rubber.  You could smell the rubber.  Smell some gunpowder from the fire and stuff.  Computers that smell.  I had no idea what you were trying to say.  Oh, you are.  Put that down.  I'm not reading that.  No, no, no.  I listened to it.  I'll read it.  It's horrible, man.  What is it?  No, no.  I didn't want to read it.  I was just kind of showing them for a little chuckle.  That line would kill in Boston. 
[03:33:30]  We'll put it that way.  I tell my friend.  The whole thing with 10 years ago and before that, computers were one of those things  that were just...  Oh, what are you doing?  It's okay, Jimmy.  No, Ben just...  I don't mean to interrupt Anthony, but Ben finally had it.  And he took the chips away from me and put them down next to Jimmy.  And Jimmy starts fiddling with him.  Yeah, so now I'm going to get the blame for that.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Beagle up. 
[03:34:00]  There you go.  No, you did not give them back to me, you ass.  Years ago when computers and people said that, you know, in the future, people will have  computers in their house and they'll use them on a daily basis.  And you could never really believe it.  And I've always been a techie.  I loved, you know, Commodore 64.  I had an Atari 800XL, you know, with a big floppy disk drive and stuff.  And it was fun stuff.  But I never really had this image of everybody having one in their house because there was  never really a reason for it.  They always said that it would happen, but they never gave a real viable reason for having 
[03:34:30]  computers in your house.  Well, it also didn't help that they were $3,000 and they were useless three weeks later.  It's like, oh, great.  Thanks for the paperweight.  That's true.  But there was never a reason.  And if somebody tried to explain the internet, you would be like, why?  There's TV.  There's newspapers.  But now you just cannot imagine getting along without it.  It's, you know, it's there.  It's part of everyone's life.  And when you can't get on the internet, people bug.  You lose your mind.  I worked at this ad agency and we did a lot of interactive website nonsense. 
[03:35:00]  And the internet connection go down because some Verizon monkey down there cut a cable or  whatever.  And everybody just sits there paralyzed.  You don't know what to do.  I'm like, let's all think about, you know, three, four years previous when we had to,  you know, type things.  Didn't have it.  You know, it's like it's reached the point where you lose your internet connection.  You feel like when you used to feel when the lights go out in your house.  Or when you lose cable.  Yeah.  Even though you know you're not going to be watching TV, but just knowing it's not there,  it just freaks you out.  How many times do you lose power and you go around and still turn the light on or go to 
[03:35:30]  turn the TV on or something like that?  You find yourself, if you lose your connection, maybe I'll screw around with a first-person  shooter for a while.  And then you shut it off and you hit an internet explorer thinking, you know, you're going  to get back online.  It just doesn't happen.  Well, Al Gore, I think, whatever the Clinton Gore campaign was, was talking about the internet's  going to be in every home.  I mean, this is so recently that they were like, oh, shut up.  I am so, I can't function without it.  It's sickening that I got caught.  I need it. 
[03:36:00]  I was talking the other day with somebody and I was saying, what the hell, I cannot remember  what you used to have to do to find simple information.  Like, they're just those little questions that mean nothing in life that you used to  have to go to a library for or something.  I mean, where did you get these answers?  You just didn't get them.  And it's a pit of darkness.  Yeah.  Because you'll get on to look up one thing on Google and three hours later, and a pack  of Marlborough's butts in the ashtray, like, damn it.  You find yourself looking at Lindsay Lohan.  You got stains on your pants. 
[03:36:30]  I always found that, too.  You definitely get detoured really quickly.  Like, I want to find out who was the actor in that movie that you go to IMDb and you end  up on some porn site minutes later.  Televisions are going to become obsolete.  Movie theaters are going to become obsolete.  Eventually, there's going to be a few suicide bombings in movies, and eventually they're just  going to be released.  There's going to be a way to do it straight to computer.  That's the way everyone's going to watch them in their homes.  Guaranteed, yeah.  Maybe in 25, 30 years.  But all this crap's going to be obsolete.  There's already a service called Akimbo that it's basically a box that sits on top of your 
[03:37:00]  TV, and you hook it up to your broadband internet connection, and it does the same thing.  You tell all your interests, whether it's, you know, Asian boys, drag racing, whatever,  and it just downloads TV shows, movies based on your interests.  Like, TiVo does that, right?  Yeah, but this actually goes out to, like, a central clearinghouse that has everything categorized,  and it's downloading it from their server to the hard drive of your box, as opposed to  TiVo, which is just recording off of live TV.  Damn, yeah, that's a pretty big database to be searching. 
[03:37:30]  And then people will complain, well, the government can see what you're looking at, because they  put in your order request, and they're going to monitor, you know, there's always...  Yeah, well, that is a concern.  There's a lot of people.  But, like, if you're not a criminal, I mean, what am I looking at?  I'm not looking at bomb-making stuff, and I'm not looking at kiddie porn, so I could  care less.  You want to see me looking at...  What about the occasional dog doing it to a woman?  It does nothing for me.  Beastie.  Oh, yeah, it does something for me.  I'm talking about, you know, when people send you links and you click on them, they're 
[03:38:00]  there, you know?  That's supposedly illegal, from what I hear.  And it's worth checking out.  Of course it is.  Horse gag is one of the funniest videos I've ever seen on the internet.  Because it's like a freak show.  It's like eight years old, 10 years old.  And supposedly, I don't know if you saw this, but yesterday, the Ted Stevens of Alaska said  that he's going to push to apply the...  Did you already talk about this?  Not really, because...  He's going to push to apply the broadcast decency standards to cable and satellite radio.  Good luck.  Never happened.  This guy just is an attention seeker.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  It would be very hard...  Getting his name out there.  ...for them to do that.  I think it would end up in court first, and I think they would lose.  It's not one of those issues like the public airwaves, you know?  It's not like they have to serve the public trust on broadcast radio.  That isn't what this is all about.  This is about paying a fee for entertainment.  It has nothing to do with the government's responsibility to deliver information to the  public through the airwaves like this. 
[03:39:00]  So they'd have a real tough time regulating this in cable TV.  And the Republicans are so anti-big government, and this is the one area, it's like, could  you stay out of my fucking life?  I don't want your morality crammed down my throat.  It's like they always scream about the left and correctly saw wanting more government,  and then they want to just go in and regulate pornography and regulate what you listen to.  Stop it!  Enough.  There's a market for it, believe me.  A huge market for it.  Yeah, you know, the Republicans pushed through this thing called the Real ID Act that says 
[03:39:30]  by 2008 the Department of Homeland Security is going to be in charge of all IDs, and it  passed the House, and it's going to the Senate, but basically they're talking about putting  those RFID chips in every driver's license.  So it would be like a federal ID.  So it's, right, all the, it's going to be a federal ID, the Department of Homeland Security  will regulate all the state driver's licenses, and this radio chip transmitter will basically  be broadcasting your data in your pocket, and are you familiar with RFID? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, so at certain locations, almost like, you could walk through.  It's like EasyPass.  Yeah, it's like EasyPass.  It's like EasyPass.  They would scan it, you know, it could be in your pocket, you wouldn't have to even pull  it out.  Yeah, you just walk by the sensor, there's already a school in California that has given  these, given RFID tags to every kid, and they can go to a computer and look at a map and  see a blip of where every kid is in the school.  Wow.  And so the, part of this legislation that they're trying to push through said that there had 
[03:40:30]  to be machine-readable technology inside these, the new IDs by 2008, and there's a lot  of privacy freaks saying that it's going to be RFID chips, so you have to, that's.  I was reading about, they want to use that also in supermarkets, which is a great idea.  All you'd have to do is load up your cart, you know, put bags in your cart, load your  groceries in, and then push it out to your car.  And at some point you pass a scanner that knows exactly what's in the cart, will deduct  it from your credit card, because that will also be scanned, and it would almost be like 
[03:41:00]  you're just stealing.  You go in there, throw it in your cart, and wheel it out.  That would be a great luxury, yeah.  We used to call that Wahoo-ing, though it was without RFID, just go grab two cases of  beer at the 7-Eleven, scream Wahoo, and run the hell toward the door.  Run!  Wahoo!  Look, man, I don't want government, but you know, people say, look, the E-ZPass, they're  like, hey man, they're going to track you, go ahead, track me, I'm not sitting in traffic  anymore.  You want to track me around the same prostitute block, night after night, be my guest.  I love the fact that it's convenient. 
[03:41:30]  I don't care if they know where I am.  That are so scared, they're like, man, and I'm like, what, the government knows that  you went across the Verrazano bridge?  Who cares?  They got you.  They got you there.  And if it comes to where they start to infringe on your rights, well then, you know what,  that's when you've got to fight in court.  Slippery slope can work for, any argument can be manipulated to any point with slippery  slope.  I don't buy it.  People use slippery slope when they really don't have a valid point yet.  Yeah.  You know, you can't argue with what might be.  Yeah, because that's what the argument always is, where it's going to lead to.  But any technology has that, the phone, oh, they can listen to it. 
[03:42:00]  No more phones.  Silly.  Carrier pigeons from now on.  Yes.  That's true.  The phone, no, wasn't one of those things that, when it came out, people were concerned  about privacy.  The internet, they can see where you're going to be.  Oh, yeah, they might abuse that.  No more internet.  You want to use that argument, we can use it for anything.  Yeah.  Silly.  And phones, I mean, you didn't have just a private phone line.  You picked it up and you had to share that stupid party line with, like, 20 knucklehead  redneck, you know, farm neighbors next door.  Hang up the phone.  Romney, it's my turn.  I've got to call Pauline down at the feed store. 
[03:42:30]  I think we're running out of show, yeah?  Ah, damn it.  What do we got, two minutes left?  Yeah.  We wanted to play, I wanted to play Monster Rain really fast, that Laszlo did.  What'd you do?  Laszlo did all the audio for Grand Theft Auto and, you know, the whole Monster Rain thing  that you did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or the story you told?  He made a fake commercial about that, remember?  Did I?  I might have even heard that.  I think I loved it.  Turn down the, uh...  Yeah, that's a good one.  The end of show music.  I want to play this real fast.  It's a little story Jimmy told about, you know, blowing little boys under the porch when... 
[03:43:00]  When I was a little boy.  Yeah, you better put that in.  Government who's monitoring me.  Back to the great storytelling medium of radio.  Oh, we've got to hurry up or we're not going to be able to play it.  So, uh, basically storm comes, uh, someone would yell Monster Rain, they would hide under  the porch because the, the rain was coming and, uh, to pass the time they'd blow each  other.  So, uh, Laszlo, uh, uh, put this together.  He was just the boy next door.  Mikey, where are you?  I don't know.  Give me a video. 
[03:43:30]  It's a game for kids.  That's sweeping the country.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Jesus H. Christ, my little baby!  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  The game you play under the porch.  Monster Rain.  Under the porch.  Where can people hear that?  I don't know.  It's not on my website.  No, you made it for our show.  I just made it for you guys.  I really want that on a Grand Theft Auto radio commercial. 
[03:44:00]  Well, the best commercial, the best fake commercial on Grand Theft Auto is the Glory  Hole one.  That's on there.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that was in San Andreas.  San Andreas, the Glory Hole theme park.  Yeah.  Glory Hole.  Lazlo, are we promoting anything today?  Nah, I'm just strung out.  I hear you.  All right, someone told me you were here to promote yourself at the Boston Comedy Connection  April 8th night.  Yes.  That's Norton.  What a plug whore, man.  Dude, I'm trying to help Lazlo.  I like him.  All right, listen.  Listen, I want to wish Eric a very, very happy birthday. 
[03:44:30]  Happy birthday, Hawk.  And, uh, yeah.  This will do it.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
