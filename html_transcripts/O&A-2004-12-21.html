<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a hilariously vulgar customer service call recounting a shouting match filled with insults.  This segued into a discussion of embarrassing male experiences, particularly buying condoms and feminine hygiene products, which quickly devolved into crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  The hosts then launched into a lengthy, amusing account of their upcoming Las Vegas trip, focusing heavily on the cringeworthy way they informed "Sex Bagel," a staff member, that he was staying behind in Washington D.C.  This was followed by several listener calls: Tom from Massachusetts angrily accused them of copying Howard Stern's Vegas trips, sparking a heated argument; Matt offered a more positive interaction; and Diane from Jersey, eight and a half months pregnant, participated in the sexually suggestive "Guess What's in My Pants" game.  The show also covered their return to commercial radio in Syracuse, discussing the challenges and potential differences from their satellite radio experience, including press coverage.  The segment ended with a shockingly offensive Christmas song mocking various religious holidays.  Jim Norton was present in studio with Opie and Anthony; Ben Sparks, Steve, and Eric were mentioned as staff.

The show continued with Opie delivering sarcastic, offensive Christmas greetings to various religious groups. This transitioned into a bizarre potato-themed segment involving someone feeding another potatoes.  Numerous XM Radio advertisements for their services, Delphi XM MiFi and Delphi SkyPy 2 radios, gift cards, and online offerings followed.  A substantial portion focused on the hosts' outrage over Mike, a staff member's, failed attempt to get a promotional sign onto a live TV news segment.  The hosts, along with Eric and Steve, expressed extreme frustration, repeatedly yelling "Go, go, go!" at Mike's perceived incompetence.  Listener calls followed, including one about a brief "Little Connor" mention on another show, another about being kicked out of an online gaming group, and a third criticizing contestants on "The Swan," leading to more offensive commentary from the hosts. The show then discussed their temporary replacement of Howard Stern in Syracuse and their views on gift-giving, including a preference for gift cards, concluding with a discussion of returning unwanted gifts.  The hosts used extensive profanity and offensive language throughout this portion, including racial slurs and misogynistic remarks.

The next segment began with the hosts expressing their dislike of crowds and slow customers, particularly those using credit cards for small purchases.  This led to a discussion of the "Liberator," a sex toy, followed by a call from Connie, its representative.  The conversation became sexually explicit, with Connie describing the product's features and fielding sexually suggestive questions.  The hosts then read emails sent to Connie's address, filled with crude comments about one host's penis size.  They briefly mentioned an upcoming interview with *The Improper*. The segment concluded with a sexually explicit South Park-style Christmas song about the Virgin Mary, XM Radio commercials, and a discussion of their Syracuse radio return and its implications for their relationship with Howard Stern, along with details about their eating habits.

The show continued with the hosts discussing a missed marketing opportunity and their "guerrilla marketing" strategy.  A call from a trucker led to a discussion about their growing trucker audience and the show's struggles after moving to a new platform, contrasting their current state with their past success.  A prank call featuring a bad Jimmy Stewart impression frustrating a tech support representative followed.  A significant portion focused on Mark "Frenchy" Frenchy's disastrous birthday party, with Frenchy himself joining the studio for a merciless roasting session participated in by the hosts and callers, including Billy Mack.  A soundboard of Frenchy insulting himself played, followed by more caller opinions and a further discussion of the show's current state, interspersed with a segment on sexual harassment training and XM Radio commercials.

The final segment featured a call with Krista, a blind woman using a text-to-speech synthesizer.  Opie and Anthony experimented with the synthesizer's settings, prompting Krista to read crude and offensive phrases.  They discussed her experiences with XM Radio accessibility issues, engaging in sexually suggestive humor and making jokes about her blindness.  A listener called to discuss a haunting song previously played, followed by interaction with another listener who repeatedly submitted the same joke.  The segment concluded with a song about "Martini Steve," XM Radio commercials, and Opie's comedic advice on amusing oneself, including pranks.

[00:01:00]  Buying rubbers has to be the most embarrassing thing in the world for guys.  And the second most embarrassing thing is when we're going to the supermarket and the girl goes,  Hey, listen, since you're already going to the store,  could you buy me a bottle of that water and vinegar stuff?

[00:07:00]  Mom, please stop falling! 
[00:07:30]  You are a disgusting fat body, Private Pyle!  Where is that Private Pyle? 
[00:08:00]  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir!  Oh, yeah.  You little scumbag!  I got your name!  I got your ass!  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Greetings.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Mostly on satellite radio, and now spreading to commercial radio as well.  Spread.  Spread that virus, you bastard.  It's the plague. 
[00:08:30]  Good morning, Anthony.  Oh, good morning.  Freezing.  It is just awful in New York City today.  Currently it's 16 degrees.  16 degrees, and it's going to be, what, 50 tomorrow?  In the studio?  16 degrees in here?  It's like a mausoleum in here.  It is.  The counter is like ice cold.  Because it's granite.  The office was ice cold.  Oh, I hate that. 
[00:09:00]  We really got to figure out where we can broadcast for the winter.  I mean, we're going to Vegas, what, in two weeks?  Oh, my goodness.  I think two weeks from today we'll be in Vegas.  We're starting to get a lot of email from listeners.  You forget, when you're doing this national radio show, you know, there are a lot of people  in the Vegas area.  There are a lot of people that just want to travel to Vegas because they have vacation  time to kind of hang out with us.  Play a few hands.  Sit at the blackjack table with us?  Sure.  We just don't have the details on the Vegas trip yet, do we?  No, we don't. 
[00:09:30]  I haven't heard any new details.  Do we have plane tickets yet?  I doubt it.  Ben, what's the latest on our Vegas trip?  We might by now have tickets, plane tickets.  Yeah, we get plane tickets.  We do.  All right, so we're flying what?  Wednesday.  Oh, all right, two weeks from tomorrow.  Should I have an itinerary emailed to me?  Good point, Ant.  Wouldn't that be nice if we could all have an itinerary?  So what's the deal?  We're flying out.  You should have that today.  We're flying out on a Wednesday, two weeks from tomorrow.  What day is that?  January 4th-ish?  5th.  5th-ish?  5th-ish. 
[00:10:00]  Let's call it January 5th-ish.  5th.  Whatever that Wednesday is.  And then we'll be in Vegas Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Coming back Sunday?  Okay.  Because a lot of listeners, I'm telling you, the email is exploding.  Dude, me and my buddy and my brother, we're in Philly, and we're thinking of going to  Vegas, so we figured we'll go when you guys go.  What's the temperature in Vegas?  Daytime temperature.  Well, it gets weird out there.  I know it gets cold at night.  Yeah, but still.  But you're in the casino.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  What is the daytime temperature, though?  Does it not even know where it reaches? 
[00:10:30]  I was in the desert one time.  My friend was yelling at me.  He's like, you Jew motherfucker, if you ever go over my head again.  So, it's going to be a lot of fun, though, the Vegas trip.  Oh, it's going to be a lot of fun, isn't it?  It's going to be a lot of fun for just about everyone that's associated with the Opie and  Anthony program.  I would say that, yeah, just about everybody involved with the show is going to have such  a good time in Vegas.  Yeah.  Well, after the show yesterday, we had a little conference call with Washington. 
[00:11:00]  Had another one of our phone meetings with the D.C.  And, you know, going over some details.  Oh, it was great.  Guys, one more thing.  I want to give you a little info on the Vegas trip.  Yeah, this was the last thing we were going to discuss, sure.  So, like, oh, okay.  Wait, I'm way in the back.  Okay.  Yeah, we're all listening.  Anthony's playing his video games, and we're just kind of hanging out in the office, and  everyone is there.  Who's there, Anthony?  It's you.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:11:30]  It's you, it's me, it's Jim Norton, it's Ben, it's Steve, it's Eric.  Yeah, it's everyone.  Pretty much everyone associated with the show, all the interns, support staff, there has to  be 15 people in the office, right?  Big meetings.  Okay.  Yeah, the Vegas trip, we got the ticket thing all sorted out.  Should be getting those today.  And, oh, Eric, you're going to be running the show from here in D.C. when everyone 
[00:12:00]  else goes to Vegas, just to let you know.  Kevin Straley, I got to tell you.  All blindsided him.  I had no idea that he was such a cold-hearted bastard.  Yeah, he said it just like, you know, hey, how you doing?  He said it like, hey, yeah, guys.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  So, he says that on the speakerphone, we all turn to Eric at the same time, there's  15 pairs of eyes looking at Eric like, oh, that's going to hurt.  He just looked so sad, too. 
[00:12:30]  That's going to hurt, because, yeah, it's pretty warm and...  It's Vegas!  No, I'm just saying, in Washington, yeah, sure, it's warm and balmy.  He just went D.C.?  Yeah, he went D.C.  Hoping he heard it wrong, another word for Vegas.  Yeah, did they call it D.C.?  Dos Kegis?  Did he say L.V.?  Right.  So, we all look at him really fast, and then we all turn away, and we're just cringing.  No one could look at Eric anymore.  Oh, I know.  Because we're all looking forward to this Vegas trip.  Get out for a couple days.  It would be nice, right? 
[00:13:00]  Sure, and it's Vegas, you know?  It's a pisser.  Yeah.  Hang out.  You're gambling.  Nightlife.  It's great.  And then Eric's going to be in those hallways of the XM compound in D.C.  Oh.  Running the show, listening to how much fun we're having.  We're listening to, yeah.  There he is.  We'll call him up, and he'll hear over the phone.  Oh, no, not much happening here.  Pretty boring.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, yeah, we're just in the casino.  Yeah, just hanging out.  Where are you?  Oh, yeah, in a meeting?  Yeah, that's got to be fun, too.  Let's see.  Did they comp you a room at the hotel you're staying in in D.C.?  Well, Anthony, right now in Vegas, it's 47 degrees.  47, like, what, this second?  This second.  What are the highs?  Well, I mean, it's 3 in the morning there. 
[00:14:00]  I know.  47 degrees right now.  It's 17 in New York, so they've got 30 degrees on us already.  Today, Anthony, it will be 60 degrees.  60, that's nice.  It's a little cold this time of year.  It's chilly.  Yeah, so it's chilly.  But 60 is much better chilly than 9.  Oh.  Well, it warms up in D.C., doesn't it?  It's further south than New York.  No?  I just think there's a better way to tell Sex Bagel that he wasn't going on the Vegas trip with us. 
[00:14:30]  You know what it is?  You give him, like, an option where he has to choose for himself, but the only real choice is D.C.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Yeah, Eric, we're thinking it would probably be best if you do the show from D.C.  You know, what do you think?  Because we need and then go through everything he needs.  Right.  Yeah, and, you know, what do you think?  And maybe throw in something a little special, too.  Like, and while you're down here in D.C., I don't know. 
[00:15:00]  Dinner with Lee?  No.  I said something special.  Dinner with Lee Abrams, that would be a bore fest.  Lee, maybe take him up in his airplane?  How many hours could you actually listen to the old days of radio before you want to puke?  No offense Lee, but, Jesus, get a hold of yourself.  I don't know, maybe a tour of the White House.  I don't know.  Ooh.  Just throw in a little perk, like, well, I know you're a little bummed.  You're not going to be with the guys in Vegas, so we got you a special tour of the White House. 
[00:15:30]  Wow.  Or something that Washington's famous for, Anthony.  That'd be sitting at a blackjack table with us for hours on end.  But at least they're having some fun.  I don't understand, but at least they would try to make his experience a little better.  Yeah.  Instead, it's like, no, you'll be in D.C., and those guys are going to rock Vegas.  You'll be in D.C.  It was like the orders came down, you know, and there was no questioning it.  And he just, he kind of slumped over a little in his chair.  Yeah.  And we all looked at him, just feeling bad, like he was the guy. 
[00:16:00]  Sex Bagel, 0-300, Washington.  Well, I think it's nice and early, and I think, well, it is nice and early.  And I think we need to give the people something to wake up to, Anthony.  Oh.  Like?  You know, something soothing, something that I'm sure a lot of alarm clocks are listening  to us right now.  Got them on, but you're laying there kind of awake, but, you know, you're still in that 
[00:16:30]  zone where you're not quite awake yet.  You know you've got to get up soon.  But you're listening to our soothing voices, aren't you?  Yes.  Go back to sleep.  You don't need to be awake now.  Yes.  Go to sleep.  You figure they'll lay in bed until 6.30.  Look at the clock and count.  All right, I got four minutes left.  I got like, I could sit here for one, two, three, eight minutes, 30 seconds. 
[00:17:00]  And that seems so long until you blink, and then you're late.  So, you know, maybe to help the folks out that are in between sleep and awake.  Yeah.  They've hit the snooze a few times.  They know they've got to get up soon.  Maybe I can play something nice and soothing.  Make that transition.  Transition into awake.  Into the awake state.  Sure.  All right.  So take a listen to this, okay?  All right, everybody.  Let's go. 
[00:17:30]  Ah, good morning, everybody.  Oh, is that horrible? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, and that's not the only time we're playing that today, by the way.  Oh.  You're going to hate us today.  You're going to hate us.  Just the fact that you hear gals of laughter behind it.  Oh, I know.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  That is awful.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's cackling.  Yeah, and then people laughing.  Like, it was a slow build of laughter.  Like, oh, it is funny by gum. 
[00:18:30]  All right, let's go to the phone and say hi to Tom in Massachusetts.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Good, man.  I'm me.  Why do you guys have to copy Howard Stern by going to Las Vegas?  You're kidding, right?  You have to be kidding, right?  Come on.  Come on, you're joking.  You can go anywhere in the country, and you've got to copy Howard.  We've got to copy Howard?  Why, is Vegas like a little hot spot that he found?  Stupid.  Yeah.  He takes his whole crew there, and now you guys got to do the same thing.  So we're copying Howard by going to Vegas for the porno awards, and what is the other 
[00:19:00]  thing we're going for?  The CES.  The CES.  He built the city.  His name was Howard Stern.  Okay, whatever.  You're copying him.  Just admit it.  You're copying.  We're copying Howard by going to Vegas?  Tom.  Like, no one else goes to Vegas?  No, Howard Stern goes.  There's no conventions like the electronics show that we're going out there for, or the  porn awards, that are held, conventions in Vegas that people go to? 
[00:19:30]  No one's ever broadcast from Vegas, you fucking puppet, you sheep, you wannabe 1987 again ass  wipe?  Good one.  Are you insane?  No, I'm not insane.  Tom.  That's a really bad argument.  It is the worst ripping off Howard argument I've ever heard.  We've heard them all, and that's by going to Vegas? 
[00:20:00]  Dude, just say Baba Booey while you're at it.  Baba Booey.  Considering you're trapped in 1989, you might as well do the Baba Booey.  1989, Baba Booey.  What?  What's that, sir?  Why don't you guys go in that chat room on your website at all?  What?  That website, I mean the chat room you got on your website.  Well, how can we go in a chat room when we're doing a radio show, you ass?  We've never seen you in there at all.  What?  Never seen any of you guys in there. 
[00:20:30]  Maybe you have.  They usually do the chat room when we're on the radio, you ass.  Maybe you have.  Maybe we don't put our names on there.  Maybe we don't assume names.  Maybe we've posted a lot in the chat room.  Maybe we're looky-loos.  I've been in there ever since they started it.  Hold on, stupid.  Let us finish laughing at looky-loos.  Yeah, looky-loos.  You stepped over my only funny line today, you ass.  Tom, you are so pissed off that the Pats blew it this morning that you're in a cranky mood  like our own Ben Sparks.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  You're a little cranky Tommy this morning, aren't you?  I'll say he is.  I don't know.  Are you just trying to cause trouble, Tom?  Stop trying to stir the pot, Tom.  No, I'm really not.  Be honest.  I'll be happy to admit it.  Tom, I see your name on my phone screen every morning, so you listen.  Yeah.  Do you realize that people that truly don't like Open Anthony, they're just not listening?  Oh, yeah.  Another thing.  They're just not listening.  I spent $300 on that XM radio to get it installed on my car.  Yeah.  Now you're giving it away for free on the radio. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, see, you've got to listen closely.  That's not true at all.  Yeah, okay.  Why do you think we're giving it away for free?  I don't know, because you want to replace Howard in 2006.  We want to replace Howard in 2006.  On the regular radio.  How do we replace Howard in 2006?  Do I get to start banging his chick?  He goes to satellite radio.  Do I get to bang his chick?  Do I take over his mansion in the Hamptons?  Do I start driving around in the stretched Escalade limo that he's got?  How do you replace Howard, you ass? 
[00:22:00]  For one thing, you guys are millionaires.  Yeah, I think we are.  Sure.  You're making fun of, yep, $3 million a year.  No, we don't make anywhere near that, buddy boy.  I swear to God.  I make a good living.  I'm able to take care of my family, but no, we don't make that much money.  Yes, you do.  We make a good living, sure.  Those two years you had off, you each made $3 million a year.  Oh, you really are deluded, sir.  And this is Norton.  I made nothing.  I got paid for six months, and I made nothing.  I think you read some reports that might have overblown the amount, sir. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You really shouldn't believe everything you read.  Okay.  Or see.  Or hear, for that matter.  It might have been a lot of money, but it sure ain't a half a billion dollars, my friend.  Still, $3 million's a lot.  It wasn't $3 million.  Where'd you get that figure, Tom?  Hannity and Combs.  That interview you guys did with him.  Hannity and Combs.  Hannity and Combs.  Did they bring that up, really?  Yeah.  That was his figure.  Yeah.  And you guys admitted it.  You said it was okay.  No, I don't know.  Have you been listening to everything we do? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  I think you like us, actually.  Tom, Tom, you said we're giving it away for free, and that pisses you off?  Yeah.  So you're in Massachusetts right now.  Why don't you get rid of your XM and turn on regular radio?  And go find us.  And find us.  Go ahead.  Because I already spent all the money on it.  No, Tom, see.  Find us.  Are we on BCN or something?  Yeah, the fact is you're not going to find us on a commercial radio station in Boston.  Yeah.  Slow down.  Yeah.  Everyone's got to slow down.  We're doing a little experiment with Syracuse, and we're going to see what happens with that. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, because you're trying to get it on regular radio all over the country again.  No, not necessarily.  Our number one priority is satellite radio.  We understand this is the future of radio and broadcasting and the future for Anthony and I.  But there may be a possibility that we could throw some of these stupid bits on regular radio.  Sure.  No, I think it's because you're jealous.  Howard Stern has 10 million viewers a day.  10 million viewers a day, sir?  Staring blankly at their radio.  You're all over the place.  Right. 
[00:24:00]  What a dick.  Hey, why isn't the picture coming in?  Tom, you're ripping off Captain Jenks.  Who's Captain Jenks?  Exactly.  Oh, no.  Captain Jenks is the man on the Howard Stern show.  Yeah, you're ripping him off.  Awful.  Dude, this is the worst insult call I've ever heard.  Yeah, go back into your time machine and come back to the year 2004, okay?  Okay.  1989 is over.  Peace out.  Nice track.  What a toll.  Boy, did he bug me.  I gave it the old college try. 
[00:24:30]  He's like the Patriots.  The Patriots.  The Patriots.  The Patriots.  The Patriots.  Yes, indeed.  How do I suck?  He's like the Patriots.  All right.  Oh, with that voice.  Yeah.  You guys are ripping Howard off.  We're going to Vegas.  Shut up.  Matt from CringeHumor.net.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hi, fella.  Oh, by the way, my name is Flea Man.  You know, I called in a week ago, but that's not important.  I just want to...  First of all, that guy, Tom, he probably just wanted Norton to go off and do his thing. 
[00:25:00]  He wanted to, you know, show his friends.  Oh, look what Norton did to me.  Oh, be the yelled at guy today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm too tired.  It's not happening.  And also, I'm just wondering, if you're going to Vegas next week, when are you going to be...  Oh, two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Oh, two weeks.  When are you going to be broadcasting on the East Coast?  Is it going to be like the same time?  Yeah, I think we're just going to not go to bed and then do the show from 3 a.m. West Coast time.  Well, first, we're going to check out how Stern did it and just copy that exact photo. 
[00:25:30]  Wait, I got a quick question.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hello?  Yeah.  I want to come down to the studio next week.  Am I allowed to just, you know, come down and hang out?  Are you good looking?  Huh?  Yeah.  Are you good looking?  Yeah, I'm pretty cute.  I'm 17.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever time you want to come down.  There's nobody under 18 allowed in this place, my friend.  When do you turn 18?  I turn 18 next August.  Oh, yeah.  I've been a fan of you guys for like four years.  Well, can't you just stop by and say hi? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you can stop by and say hi.  I don't care.  All right.  You'll realize it's not that exciting.  Well, you know, I sent a couple pictures.  I sent a picture.  I have Master Poe, like, breaking my arm.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Well, we'll see you next week, okay?  Okay, cool.  All right, bye.  All right.  Bye, fella.  I got school.  All right.  Well, Anthony, everyone is talking about our move back to commercial.  You want to try to explain this to the people?  They're panicking out there.  Really?  I have a hard time explaining it because I'm not even sure about it. 
[00:26:30]  Well.  I don't even know what it is.  Yeah, we're on in Syracuse.  Yeah, 95X.  Rock Radio.  95X.  Turn it up.  And we're having meetings and we're all chit-chatting with each other trying to figure out how to  translate the program we do here without compromising it and put it on commercial radio.  Right.  Whether it's by doing it to cut up a little bit, delay, or what have you. 
[00:27:00]  But we'll figure it out.  It's an experiment.  Yeah, a lot of people are panicking.  No, we're just going to do a radio show for satellite radio.  And then if a commercial station wants to pick it up and they can make it make sense, that's great.  Yeah.  But right off the bat, most commercial radio stations play a lot of commercials.  You've probably noticed by now that Anthony and I talk sometimes an hour and a half without even breaking.  Okay?  So there's a ton of opportunities to continue the satellite radio show while the commercial stations fit their commercials in. 
[00:27:30]  Uh-huh.  All right?  Plus, they're going to have to bleep things out.  Plus, they're not going to be able to air certain segments because they're too dirty.  So then at that point, they're going to have to find something else to play.  Maybe another Opie and Anthony thing from the past that's cleaner.  Yeah.  But if you have satellite radio, you shouldn't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  This is the better version.  Don't worry.  And we're not even sure if it's going to work.  But it's worth trying, right?  It's easy to do a show on regular radio and then put it on satellite. 
[00:28:00]  That's the easy one.  People do that.  Now there are people that broadcast and they broadcast to satellite.  But to do it the other way is a little rough, you know, because you've got such freedom here.  You don't have the FCC digging in your ass.  So we've got to figure it out.  Right.  But in the meantime, shut up.  Quit griping.  Yeah, basically, Fareed, one of our old pals, you know, gave us a call late Friday and said,  Hey, I want to try this thing.  I want you guys to replace Howard Stern in Syracuse on one of my radio stations, 95X. 
[00:28:30]  And, you know, we'll try for a couple weeks and see what happens.  Right.  And if that works, then, you know, there's a few other stations in his radio group that  are interested in picking up the show as well.  I don't even know what they're playing today in Syracuse on the commercial station.  I have no idea.  I know yesterday it was a huge clusterfuck.  And they pretty much just played old tracks from our Demented World CD and they played  the cuts.  We haven't even played for our satellite radio audience because we don't even think they're  that good anymore.  Really?  I don't even remember.  We put out a CD, I don't know, about seven years ago called Demented World that's really 
[00:29:00]  hard to find because the record label we use just stinks.  And we're very proud of the thing.  There was 31 tracks.  I think we played maybe 10 of them on the new show here on XM Satellite radio.  And they picked a few that we would never play because they're just not that funny anymore.  So I don't know how it sounded because we haven't heard them in a long time.  Right.  So I guess that's all they did yesterday was play tracks from Demented World and us talking  about how we're on in Syracuse, you know, all those liners we cut. 
[00:29:30]  And then they played a lot of rock and roll.  But the good news is that we're creating a pretty huge buzz across America.  The press articles are slowly but surely trickling in, Anthony.  And this is from DCRTV.com.  The message board down there in D.C.  I always got the impression they didn't enjoy the Opie and Anthony program.  The folks in D.C.?  No, that website.  Yeah, it's a website that talks about all the happenings in radio and TV in D.C. 
[00:30:00]  I think he's all buddied up with Don and ass.  Don and Mike Hall.  Dick and ass.  Actually, Mike isn't the problem.  Mike actually is a nice guy that hates Don but has to deal with Don.  They do a funny show, though, man.  I just sometimes put them on and just laugh.  Just stop it.  Oh, you never knew what those guys were going to say.  Oh.  Oh, they were funny.  Awfulness.  Come on, dude.  Sometimes I'm sitting there and I don't know what's going to happen next and the guy's  wife calls in.  And just the things that come out of her mouth, what a card. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  You want to laugh.  That's the show to go to.  Let's go to Hard Rock in Virginia.  Hard Rock, what's up?  Yeah, I wonder how come y'all take shit from shit decks like Tom instead of blowing them  off the fucking air.  Because I think he ends up making a fool of himself.  I'm glad Don made his ass look like a fucking fool.  Dude, I'm just tired of people.  Yeah, I'm just tired of people making fun of y'all. 
[00:31:00]  And, I mean, y'all are making the money, not them.  You know, if you're going to dish out the abuse, you've got to take some, too.  But the guy just made a fool of himself.  I don't mind a vicious call.  I like listening to assholes like that because they're uninformed and they're living in a  time that no one cares about anymore.  1989.  That's like 1989 shit where you would call the competing radio station and say, Baba Booey  and, you know, Opie and Anthony Rule.  You know?  Yeah.  Back then it was, you know, when that happened, the DJ that was on the air would go into a 
[00:31:30]  panic mode.  But now it just doesn't matter anymore.  It doesn't, who cares?  No one.  It's 19, it's 19, it's not, I know, I was going to say it's not 1989 anymore.  So anyway.  There's an NBC news van setting up at 57th and Broadway.  I saw it, too, when I came in, but now we're getting another instant feedback here.  I don't know what the story is down there.  What could it be?  57th and Broadway?  I don't know. 
[00:32:00]  It's one of those big bands with the boom.  Oh, really?  For a live shot.  Live shot, 57th and Broadway.  Live shot, 57th and Broadway.  We have signs.  We have signs.  Yeah.  And we have interns.  And we have interns.  Yeah, maybe send somebody down there.  What do they do?  When do they do the news?  Six?  Well, they're probably going to go live next.  I mean, it's 6.30.  So, why don't we, who do you want to send down there?  I don't know.  We should send someone down there.  Can they hide one of those Lil' Connor signs? 
[00:32:30]  Take the Lil' Connor, Ovi and Anthony's.  You want that one on TV today?  More than anything.  What's the other one?  I don't remember.  Donkey Sausage.  Donkey Sausage.  And then there's a couple others.  Eric, you want to do it?  Mike's going.  Mike's going?  I was visited last night in my game by a couple of people.  Donkey Sausage, I want to say hi to.  Lil' Connor.  And Connor Peterson, who came up and said nothing but mommy.  Mommy with a question mark after it every time he chatted. 
[00:33:00]  Hey.  Hey, Steve.  Is that kid smart enough to do this?  Oh, Jesus, Ovi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually has been going out every day for the past couple of months.  Hey, you know something?  They might be on to you if they see the sign.  Yeah.  Is there a way to fold that sign in half and maybe keep it under his jacket?  I was actually going to give him.  You can't fold it.  Yeah, you can't really fold them.  I was going to give him both of these and have him just hold them up against one another  so he didn't really.  Yeah, he should hold up both at the same time.  That would be good.  Which one of these interns is going? 
[00:33:30]  Young Mike is going.  Which one's Young Mike?  Exactly.  The one that knows Mike.  Exactly.  He's the quiet one that kind of hides every morning.  Is he that creepy, quiet one that just comes in?  Yeah, that's why I'm asking.  I don't know.  We've got to see what he can do.  I think he's good.  You want to see what he can do?  This might be a great opportunity for the radio show, though.  It would be.  We love when people get on live shots.  All right.  All right, we'll see what he does.  Yeah.  So they're reporting our move back to commercial radio, Anthony.  This is just the first step, by the way.  It's going to get even more interesting as the months go on here.  And DCRTV.com writes, new broadcast radio deal for ONA. 
[00:34:00]  Is radio station group owner Citadel pulling Howard Stern off of some of its stations and  is, wait, is radio station, some of this shit that never makes sense.  Is radio station group owner Citadel pulling Howard Stern off of some of its stations and  is replacing him with Opie and Anthony?  Doesn't make sense.  It doesn't, right?  In any case, we're being told that ONA will continue to be heard uncensored via DC-based  XM satellite radio.  ONA used to air on a batch of broadcast radio stations, including the DC area's WJFK, but 
[00:34:30]  Infinity yanked them in 2002 after they hyped a sex stunt that took place in a church.  Hyped.  So then we got this one.  Opie and Anthony back on terrestrial radio.  But it's evidently a short-term gig as XM VP Corporate Communications Chance Patterson  confirms to R&R that Citadel has struck a deal to bring the controversial pairs program to  Citadel's WAQX 95X Syracuse.  The duo are believed to be fill-in host for syndicated morning host Howard Stern, who is 
[00:35:00]  airing Best of Programs until January 3rd, 2005.  Opie and Anthony currently host a show on XM, for which subscribers must pay a premium to  hear.  It's unclear if the show is being heard live in Syracuse or on delay.  XM programming guru Eric Logan, better known as ELO, and Citadel's-  It doesn't call him ELO in there, does it?  And Citadel Syracuse GM Darren Smith did not return R&R's call seeking details on the arrangement.  The duo have not been heard on terrestrial radio since the summer of 2002 when they were  fired from Infinity's WNAW New York following their now infamous Sex for Sam promotion, which 
[00:35:30]  involved a couple reportedly having intercourse in St. Pat's Cathedral.  What's his name, Chance?  Chance Patterson.  I don't know Chance.  Do I know him?  Sure you do.  I don't like that name.  Oh, there's the live shot.  Damn it.  He's out in front of Dwayne Reed doing the story on Aleve.  Oh yeah, what's going on with the Aleve?  I don't know.  I take it a lot.  What's going on with-  And Celebrex and Aleve.  If you take it like every day for arthritis, they have like a therapy, so you take it every 
[00:36:00]  day.  Oh.  It could give you heart problems like that other one they're talking about.  There you go.  I think we just missed our opportunity.  Well, is he still in the building?  Ben?  Did you put his little coat on?  They might go back.  Yeah, they might.  Do they?  Damn it.  I don't know, man.  I think that's it.  I was pissed off about the Aleve story.  The news did it again last night.  They're like, some very important information concerning Aleve. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, what?  But first-  Oh.  I'm sitting there like I got Aleve all over my house.  I got one in my mouth and my glass of water's in my hand.  Could you please?  Enough with the news teases.  But it's life-threatening, you know?  Something could kill you right now.  Your kids could be playing with a toy that could kill them.  Tune in at 11 for details.  Right, 11.  My kids are in the other room with 100 toys.  What?  Just tell me which one I have to take out of the room. 
[00:37:00]  Do you need ratings that bad?  I'll get the details on it later.  Just tell me the name of the thing.  Right, yeah.  How about you give me a hint?  They tease everything on the news.  The stupid weather.  Last night, I'm trying to catch the weather before I go to sleep.  And the guy is like, yeah, it's going to-  They give you this vague thing.  Yeah, the sun will come up tomorrow.  And we'll tell you more about the weather later.  Well, you went to him.  He couldn't pop out a degree or something?  Am I going to need a slicker?  And let's be honest, the weatherman is just a waste of time anyway. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Just show the five-day forecast and temperature.  Whether it's the sun or a sun with half clouds covering it.  That's all you need.  You don't need the five-minute tirade.  Not a tirade, but little sun peeking out.  Right.  That's all you need.  Tomorrow, 50 degrees high, no rain in the forecast.  Thank you.  That's it.  Move on to sports guy.  And then finally, Anthony, this one says, 
[00:38:00]  Opie and Anthony return to the FM dial at least for two weeks  on Citadel's Howard Stern affiliate in Syracuse.  Citadel's WAQX is replacing Stern's morning show with O&A  while Howard's in holiday time best-of mode.  Meanwhile, Citadel's Stern affiliate in Harrisburg plugged in its own local morning show today.  So I don't know what they're doing in Syracuse today,  so maybe one of our fine XM satellite radio listeners in the Syracuse area  can kind of tune in 95X and tell us what they're running today.  Yeah.  Are they running this program?  Are they running more tracks from Demanded World? 
[00:38:30]  Have they given up on the whole thing already?  Let us know.  Yeah.  We're all very curious to know what they're doing today in Syracuse, okay?  How ridiculous is it that some guy has to stand out in front of a Dwayne Reed drugstore  at this hour of the morning, it's dark and cold out,  because they're doing a story about a drug.  I don't get it.  They didn't talk to anybody.  They didn't go inside. 
[00:39:00]  It's just him standing in front of the place.  Just standing in front of the place, yeah.  It's not a story that a murder took place there,  and that's where they are, and, you know, the police tape is there.  Hey, Bob, just go down there and stand in front of a drugstore.  We're going to throw it to you.  Then you yap a little bit about the drugs,  and come back to us.  They may go back live, though.  Do we have that guy going out there?  Yeah, we're going to give it a shot.  Might as well give it a shot.  Young Mike.  Take a look-see.  Maybe.  I don't know if they're...  Well, whatever. 
[00:39:30]  We'll see what happens.  All right.  Why, you know the new schedule better than anybody?  You don't think they'll go back?  Nah, it's the leave story.  That's it.  Yeah.  Until 7 o'clock.  And then, what, 7 o'clock?  I think they start all the morning shows, right?  Yeah.  So it's over, Johnny.  Damn it.  Missed opportunity right there.  We'll see.  Let's go to the phones really fast here.  Say hi to Diane in Jersey.  Diane, what's up?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Why are you laughing?  I'm laughing because I'm being a pig for my husband. 
[00:40:00]  You're being a pig for your husband?  I'm being a pig for my husband.  What a great reason to be a pig.  Why are you being a pig for your husband?  He wanted me to give him a little early Christmas present.  And what's that?  I think I want to play Guess What's in My Pants.  All right.  Ooh.  Hey, this could be interesting.  Hmm.  For your husband, what did he say?  Call up and play?  He always talks about you guys.  He's probably one of your biggest fans.  Do you know how to play?  I do know how to play.  He explained it to me last night.  All right. 
[00:40:30]  Uh, well, we need to know what you look like.  Okay.  Uh, what kind of detail are you looking for?  How tall are you, first of all?  I'm 5'6".  All right.  5'6".  All right.  I got to get my little notepad out.  5'6".  5'6".  Okay.  How much you weigh?  Before I got pregnant or after?  Both.  Both.  You had a baby?  I have.  I'm having a baby in about three weeks.  Oh.  Wait.  In three weeks?  You just got a tent in front of Opie's awful little pants.  Yeah.  I love that. 
[00:41:00]  I have a weird pregnant fetish thing.  Yeah.  He said that.  You don't sell puppies on a website, do you?  No.  No.  Oh.  Oh, that's sick.  That is sick.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Norton puts ketchup on his egg whites.  Eat that now, thinking of that whole scene.  Oh, I just want to carry it in my hands.  Did that story shake you up a bit, being probably as pregnant as she was?  It freaked me out a little bit.  Yeah.  You start thinking, some lunatics out there. 
[00:41:30]  Hey, can you hold on one second?  Cut you open.  I think this is Dave from yesterday.  You know how we like to jump around.  We'll get back to Diane in a second.  It's Dave in Syracuse.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Are you listening to 95X for us today?  Yeah, I'm listening to it right now.  All right.  What are they playing today?  Are they playing us live?  No, they're playing like a best of.  They're playing the Frankie Blue thing right now.  Oh.  Oh, Frankie Blue.  All right.  Let's listen for a second.  All right.  Make Frankie Blue drinks every afternoon. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Throw some Mickeys in his drinks and some freaking nudes and throw this guy on the air  every day during afternoon drive.  Who's not doing it?  All right.  I know what they're doing.  I keep getting scared that we're going to curse.  I know.  I'm listening.  I'm like, ah, I'm shaking.  Know what they're doing in Syracuse today?  That's yesterday's show.  So I think we're a day behind.  But at least they're running an actual show instead of the stupid tracks from Demented World.  Yeah.  Did you guys catch that?  Yeah, we did, Dave.  Thank you so much.  It sounds like yesterday's show. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Hey, Jim.  I can't help you.  I'm going to be in New York a couple days before Christmas.  Is there anything entertaining to do?  Sure.  You can come to my house and fuck my sister.  Well, you might mean to.  If you want to come see Nathaniel, the intern, he's performing at the downtown on December 23rd.  I might stop there just to go on after him for a few minutes.  But our own intern, let me give you the number for the downtown, just for this kid.  He's good. 
[00:43:00]  516-293-7700.  It's Naughty Nathaniel's Christmas extravaganza show.  Naughty Nathaniel.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  That's cool.  It looks like they're playing yesterday's show, Anthony.  There are also a lot of live shots today from Yankee Stadium because tickets are going on sale  and they've got people camping out in the freezing cold.  So they've got news crews down there.  If anybody in the area wants to make up a sign, go to Yankee Stadium, get it on the news. 
[00:43:30]  We'll give you something.  Do we have a MiFi to give away?  I think we have one more MiFi to give away.  If someone gets on live TV today, we'll give it to you.  Simple as that, okay?  All right.  Wow.  Why not?  Why not?  We're crazy.  Let's get back to Diane in Jersey.  Diane in Jersey.  So you're 5'6", about eight and a half months pregnant, and you want to play Guess What's  in My Pants.  Have we ever played Guess What's in My Pants with a pregnant woman, Anthony?  We've done a lot with pregnant women, but I don't think we've ever played Guess What's  in My Pants.  Is your husband there right now?  Yeah, he is.  Man, maybe you guys should just bang on the show today. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, not eight and a half months pregnant.  Why not?  Are you guys still having sex?  I was saying we should just bang.  Yeah, we had sex last night.  He's got to leave for work.  He's saying, I can't bang her.  I've got to go to work.  You had sex last night?  Yeah, we did.  How does an eight and a half month pregnant woman have sex?  You have to be very creative.  Really?  Well, it can't be the normal missionary.  No, it's definitely not the normal missionary.  What are you, on all fours?  On all fours, on top, on the side. 
[00:44:30]  On top?  Yeah.  Backward cowgirl?  Not backward cowgirl.  Don't you worry about damaging the child?  It's going to come out with dents in his forehead.  Oh, that old gag.  No, we're not worried about that.  No?  No.  Doctor said it's okay.  Yeah, it's cool for now.  So you're horny all the way up to the end, huh?  Apparently.  Who knew?  So, all right. 
[00:45:00]  So you guys did a doggy style?  A little bit of that, a little bit on the side.  A little on the side.  What?  Your spoon?  Yeah, a little bit of spooning.  A little spooning?  A big fat spoon?  Yeah.  And you hear, ah, not there, not there, not there.  Okay, all right.  Yeah, that's kind of like it, not like that.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  All right, and it was, and you had, all right, okay, sure, they had sex last night, Anthony.  That's, you know, that's not right.  Why?  Why is that not right?  The kid doesn't need to be splashed with that, you know? 
[00:45:30]  It's kind of rude.  It's rude.  Why not prepare him for grammar school?  Yeah, we're not sending him to Catholic school.  Wow.  All right.  Well, I say we play Guess What's in My Pants with the pregnant lady.  Sure.  Why not?  Sure.  All right, so how much do you weigh now?  Way too much.  Well, how much?  Probably about 180 pounds.  Five, six, 180 pounds.  I have a humongous belly. 
[00:46:00]  I have a big kid inside me.  And be honest, how much do you weigh without the kid inside?  Like 138.  All right.  Not bad.  Well, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  138 when she's not pregnant, Anthony.  Five, six.  Yes.  Okay.  And are you a brunette?  Yes, I am.  And brown eyes?  Green eyes.  Damn.  All right, green eyes.  I was trying to be Kreskin here.  And I'm assuming really big boobs, right?  Double D before pregnancy. 
[00:46:30]  Whoa.  Holy crap.  Those must be a mess right now.  I'm awed by your power.  She's pregnant.  Wow, you must have big breasts.  You can see the future, man.  It's like he's gazing through her telephone.  That's exactly what Kreskin does.  That's exactly how Kreskin does.  Well, yeah, that's what I was saying.  I understand.  We have no respect for Kreskin.  You should know that if you're listening to the show.  Stupid Kreskin.  Hey, is it your first kid?  Yes, it is.  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  How old is she?  I'm 37.  37?  What career girl are you?  I'm a career girl.  And you guys finally decide what the hell?  Time to have a kid?  Well, we just got married a year ago, so we got busy right away.  My career is putting jelly in the jelly donut.  All right, Anthony, I guess you've got to explain the rules of guess what's in my pants.  We weren't going to play this today, but, I mean, pregnant lady, you've got to do it.  We've got to do it, right?  Yeah, we can't pass this up.  It might add some kind of sound that we have no clue what it is.  It could throw us off.  It could throw off Jim's fine record he has. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, the game is easy.  We'll ask you to rub the phone on that area in various directions, up and down, side to side, and then the circular motion.  And then based solely on the sound it makes, we will try to guess what hairstyle you're sporting.  Okay.  The choices, the standard triangle, which is the standard issue for all women.  Okay.  The mohawk, which is like a little mohawk on an engine's head. 
[00:48:00]  Okay.  You know, a strip.  And then the Hitler mustache, which is just a little tuft of hair.  Okay.  In the area.  And then all the rage these days, very popular, the clean-shaved wood floor, Jambonet Ramsey.  Or Jim, if you would please, what else is used to describe this type of style?  The underside of Conor Peterson's chin.  Oh, God.  Smooth, sleek, clean, nary a hair to be found. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  And then after we do this, we will ask you what's in your pants, and you will tell us.  But don't tell us.  Don't give us any clues, no hints, no reaction to our guesses until we ask you, indeed, what is in your pants.  Okay.  All right.  But first, the theme song.  Oh, it's a theme song.  Oh, it's a theme song.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place my receiver upon your beaver. 
[00:49:00]  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  Shut up!  You don't like the song yet?  No, I like the song.  Okay.  I hit the wrong button.  It's supposed to be this one.  Stay out the bushes!  Yeah, it's going to be a hairy mess down there.  You think?  Ah, yeah, she doesn't have time to worry about keeping that area clean.  I was kind of thinking what a pregnant woman might do. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, if you would please take the telephone.  Okay.  And rub it in an up and down fashion.  Up and down, straight up and down?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Was that the welcome mat to your house?  Jesus.  Could you do side to side, ma'am?  Yes.  Okay. 
[00:50:00]  Hmm.  All right, circular.  Circular.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  She wants off the phone so bad at this point.  It's tough.  I'm just giving a Christmas present to my husband.  This is a Christmas present to your husband?  I'm being a pig for him.  He's a good egg.  Yeah, guys like when their women are pigs for them. 
[00:50:30]  Maybe he just wanted a MiFi, though.  He would love a MiFi.  Of course he would.  I'm in a dilemma because I'm thinking that...  Well, once you hear one more, you're basing it more on what you're thinking than the sound,  though.  Yeah, that's true.  Just close your eyes, Luke.  Use the force.  You want to hear up and down or side to side again?  I want to hear side to side again if I could miss.  Sure.  Ah, very telling.  Yeah, side to side, but I'm distracted by up and down. 
[00:51:00]  Up and down doesn't match side to side.  Let me hear up and down, please.  Okay.  See?  Up and down tells me one thing.  Side to side tells me another, which leads me to believe...  Okay, I got my guess.  There's definitely hair down there.  Yeah.  Don't tell us yet.  I'm going to go with the obvious.  She decided just to let it rock and roll for eight months, eight and a half months.  So it's going to be like, you know, kind of like a natural triangle.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  I'm going to guess Mohawk because I think the fact that they're still banging, she puts  some kind of care into it.  But the fact she's pregnant is probably a little harder to care for just because of the logistics  of having the 180 pounds.  That's true.  So I'm going to guess Mohawk.  I, too, because of the consistency of the up and down sound and then the difference in  the side to side sound leads me to believe that it is Mohawk, too.  So my guess is Mohawk. 
[00:52:00]  Diane, if you would please tell us what is in your pants.  It is a standard issue.  Wow.  Hope he's got it.  Finally.  I haven't won one of these in a long time.  Why the hell is the sound so different side to side?  That's odd.  I don't know.  That's very soft.  Very soft.  So when was the last time you shaved?  About three days ago.  I thought you were going to say three years ago.  Wow.  Wait, what do you mean three days ago?  What did you do three days ago?  Three days ago I trimmed it and about three weeks ago I had it waxed. 
[00:52:30]  Totally bald or no?  No.  Oh, okay.  Not now.  Yeah, pregnancy.  You're pregnant.  You should have told me that because it's too hard to maintain.  It's like hell.  And what style are you going back to after the kid's born?  Mohawk.  Mohawk.  Very nice.  Mohawk.  We don't get any credit for at least seeing that coming?  No.  All right.  Nothing.  All right.  Are we done with her?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Thank you.  Diane, thank you.  Thank your husband for listening and happy holidays.  Hey, do you know if you have a, is it a boy or a girl?  It's a boy.  Oh, good luck.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Enjoy, okay?  Thank you.  Name him Connor. 
[00:53:00]  Bye.  All right, Diane.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  I think we're going to take a quick break here, Anthony, and continue with the program. 
[00:53:30]  Wow.  Rev checking in saying we should have had her put the phone on her belly so Opie can yell there  is no Santa to the little fetus.  Very good, Rev.  As we go to break, a South Park Christmas song.  Oh.  I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East.  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.  They have different religious beliefs.  They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday. 
[00:54:00]  And so every December I go to the Middle East and say.  Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry fucking Christmas.  Put down that book, the Koran, and here's some holiday wishes.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fucking celebrate.  There is no holiday season in India, I've heard.  They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd. 
[00:54:30]  They never read a Christmas story.  They don't know what Rudolph is about.  And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout.  Hey there, Mr. Hinduist.  Merry fucking Christmas.  Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the missus.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fucking celebrate.  Now I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin. 
[00:55:00]  They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.  On December 25th, all they do is eat a cake.  And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and...  Sayin' hi...  Hi there, Mr. Shintoist.  Merry fucking Christmas.  God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.  In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do.  So let's all rejoice for Jesus.  Merry fucking Christmas to you.  On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say... 
[00:55:30]  Daoish Christmas, bonus, and all you atheists too.  Merry fucking Christmas to you.  What happened to the potatoes?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From O&A Pictures.  You always liked potatoes, that's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  It won't happen again, I can promise you it. 
[00:56:00]  How far will one man go?  Well, I'm gonna have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The Potato Diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here, open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes, don't eat.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing of potatoes, Danny.  Everything's delicious.  The Potato Diva.  I need the potatoes.

Utah's largest single ski and snowboard resort.  3,500 skiable acres, 8 mountains, and 146 trails.  Visit thecanyons.com to find out more.  New snow to the east.  Some continued cold temperatures for more snowmaking making a big difference.  Killington and Okemo in Vermont, both with some fresh snow early part of the week.  Now 50 miles open in Killington with their Pico Mountain open and Bear Mountain opening up later this week. 
[01:00:00]  Jiminy Peak in the Berkshires ready with six miles and night skiing and a couple inches of new snow.  Up to Whiteface in the Adirondacks, over 40 trails open.  Hunter in the Catskills with 30 runs also in New York.  Their terrain park is open.  Snowshoe Mountain in West Virginia picking up fresh snow to start off the week.  Over 30 trails.  Their Cup Run opens on Wednesday at Snowshoe.  Now out west where Vail, Colorado continues down over 4,300 acres with packed powder conditions.  Jackson Hole, Wyoming with 65 runs. 
[01:00:30]  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  XM 202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
[01:01:00]  I told you not to send Mike.  Ah, we're back with the ONA virus spreading across America.  Why didn't he go?  We had a perfect opportunity for another assault on the media.  Why didn't you go?  You're the guy, dude.  You're the guy.  I was on the phone.  Otherwise, I would have went.  Steve sent him out.  I turned around and he's already gone.  It was obviously, it was a live shot.  Why didn't he go in front of the camera?  What do you mean you're on the phone?  This is the number one priority.  Screw, who were you talking to that that was more important than getting a sign on live TV this morning? 
[01:01:30]  There was no one screening the phone, so I was screening the phones.  Then I turned around and I saw all that.  Wait, instead of going to get a sign on live TV, you're seeing what these dopey listeners want to talk about today?  Oh, my God.  Where is Mike?  Didn't he go?  Is he on the phone?  Yeah, Mike's on the phone.  He's asking why he didn't go.  Didn't go where?  Mike?  Hold on, hold on.  Sorry, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Mike?  Yes, sir?  Did you see the shot go live?  No.  It went live?  Get out of here.  Holy shit.  I'm standing across the street and they're walking around the van now. 
[01:02:00]  Mike just came on in the van.  Yeah, but they were just live.  The guy was out in front.  Dude, we were all just watching.  We were going like, go, go, go.  We were just watching Channel 4.  Everyone was watching Channel 4.  They went to the guy live.  We're going, go, go, go, go, go.  What do you think was going on?  How did you not see he had the live shot?  What did they do live shot? 
[01:02:30]  I told you.  What did I say before this story?  I go, can this guy handle it?  Well, the Today Show is doing a thing.  I can hook it down there, sir.  No, no, I mean.  No, no, no.  I mean, they're doing a story on it.  I don't know.  Are they cleaning up over there or does it look like they're going to do another shot?  The light just came out of the van and that's when I called in.  I mean now.  Right now, nobody's over there.  Are they cleaning up?  Does it look like they're done?  Don't see anything, sir. 
[01:03:00]  I saw some guy open the van door and that was it.  Okay, I can't.  All right, Mike.  Well, good try.  Thank you.  Yep.  All right.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  You know, I have to be a little more understanding.  I've got to understand that some people have it.  Dude, what did I say before?  I said, could this guy handle it?  I knew he couldn't handle it.  No.  And these dummies that work for us, why are you sending him out?  Because he's eager and he...  Dude, that was a great opportunity for us. 
[01:03:30]  You guys got to wake the fuck up.  He doesn't have it.  Why are you sending the kid that no one has talked to since he's been here?  That's right, prison yard hat.  Thank you, Jim.  It's really a prison yard hat?  Yeah, it's awful.  Okay, thanks.  Why, Eric, why didn't you go?  That was a perfect opportunity.  It was a block away.  We had a live film crew.  Yeah.  You get the job done.  I was screening calls before I heard everything go on.  And then when I turned around, Mike was already going.  So I just went, okay, Mike's going with the signs.  Oh, boy.  And he walked out.  I will go next time. 
[01:04:00]  He didn't even know that there was a live shot.  He didn't even know that they went live.  Did he miss it completely?  Yeah, the lights were on.  He didn't see anything.  It was on.  It was there.  We're going, go, go, go, go, go.  He literally panicked and just got nervous.  I think he panicked.  I think he panicked.  I think he panicked and didn't want to be the guy.  Some people have it.  Some people don't.  I told you guys, can this guy handle it?  I knew that the guy couldn't handle it.  And I'm waiting for you guys to step up and take care of business.  No, you know what it is.  The kid's been going out for the past three days doing this stuff. 
[01:04:30]  So I'm assuming that he's eager to do it.  Doing what stuff, Steve?  He was outside of the Today Show yesterday.  And did he get on TV?  He said they panned to him.  I don't know if they.  What?  I don't know.  No.  No.  No.  If he got on the Today Show with one of our signs, I think we would have heard by now.  Usually when something like that happens, our email explodes.  Hundreds of emails.  Holy shit.  Did you see the Today Show this morning, guys?  Just in case you did it.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, we don't send him out anymore.  Eric, you should win.  I want his D-O-R. 
[01:05:00]  Why didn't you go, Eric?  You're the man.  Okay.  I'll go next time.  No, there is no next time.  That's right.  Yeah, there's going to be a next time where a news crew is going to be a block away from  where we're broadcasting from.  Yeah, there'll be a next time.  A block away.  Someone kill a homeless person outside the studio, so they'll be right in front of the  station next time.  Yeah, there you go.  We can start making news.  Good.  Good.  That was a great opportunity.  Missed.  He was there.  He had the signs.  They went live.  What happened? 
[01:05:30]  We're screaming, go, go, go, go, go, go.  And nothing.  Was he on the cell phone or no?  He was on hold.  He could hear us.  Oh, brother.  They went live?  They went live.  They went live for a while, too.  But he missed the fact that they even went live.  I know.  I think he saw it.  How did he miss that?  I just got too nervous.  I think he just hid shivering with his signs across the street.  And he goes, I'm across the street.  Across the street?  You got to be right there waiting to just run into the camera.  Why?  He didn't want to jaywalk?  Someone that works for the show has horrendous judgment. 
[01:06:00]  Hmm.  Who is that?  I don't know, but it seems like it's one of these three.  Could it be Ben?  Could it be Steve?  Could it be Eric?  Or could it be all three?  Yes.  Dude, Tom Brady stinks.  That's not Ben.  Shout out, you awful Boston fan.  That's not Ben.  Ben's just worried about the Pats loss last night.  That's all he cares about today.  5.30 this morning.  We're in the office.  Ben's on the phone.  Dude, dude.  You know, he couldn't hold on to the ball.  I'm not going to blame him.  I'm not going to be like the Red Sox. 
[01:06:30]  They had a bad game.  They lose two games in two years.  I'm not blaming him.  They're going to lose.  I'm going to lose.  You were doing a little sniveling.  You were sniveling.  I'm not blaming him for anything.  You were doing some belly aching this morning.  I'm sad.  I'm depressed.  Why?  Because now we're going to lose home field advantage?  You guys are spurled.  Shut up.  Dallas is doing so well, Jim.  No, but I take it like a man.  I have faith in my quarterback.  That's the Verde.  Oh, he's great.  This is going to be his.  He's got a couple of good games coming up by consents.  I'm not going to trash braid at all. 
[01:07:00]  He's a great quarterback.  Nah, but you know he stinks.  Good bad game.  Whatever.  All I have to say is, why not the Bills?  Why not the Bills?  A good point.  At least he's not a crybaby like Pennington.  Why not the Bills?  He's not a crybaby.  He's a fun guy, Pennington.  Jay Moore looking guy that he is.  He is handsome.  Looks like Macaulay Culkin.  A grown-up Macaulay Culkin?  Yeah.  He's a pretty kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, that was a complete disaster.  Yep.  So now he's slithering back to the office.  Where's this live shot?  There's live shots all over the place today. 
[01:07:30]  Where the hell's that?  Times Square?  Yep.  That looks like Times Square, right?  We have to turn the volume up on some of these so we can catch these.  That is Times Square.  Back in a minute.  There are TV crews all over New York today.  They're everywhere.  On this TV.  Oh, they're showing people scraping their windshields of the ice and driving and stirring in the snow.  The snowblower.  Of course, because this doesn't happen every year.  The lady that forgot her gloves.  Oh, yeah.  There's the truck sliding down the street. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, we're here at Home Depot.  What are you buying?  I'm buying salt.  Ugh.  Jim, he's buying salt.  You're buying a shovel to clear that driveway out?  Well, no.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And I'm going to put her in the yard and put lye on her body so the dog doesn't dig her up.  Back to you, Frank.  So the dog doesn't dig her up.  Back to you in the studio.  Oh, and there's the 18-wheeler off the highway.  There you go.  Every year, same freaking shot. 
[01:08:30]  People stocking up on milk and bread and eggs.  I guess a lot of French toast is going to be made during this snowstorm.  Oh, back to you.  Back to you, douchebag.  All right.  Well, let's say hi to Forrest in Maine.  What's up, Forrest?  Not much.  I just want to tell you guys, you already got this on all media going on.  Yeah, what happened?  Last Thursday on Alan Combs, who's XM-affiliated talk radio, they have a live, they end the  show with a live reader, listener calling, where everybody gives one sentence on any topic 
[01:09:00]  you want.  And there was a quick Little Connor reference that I think a few more of those could really  help the virus.  What did they say?  Somebody called me real quick, and it's like only three seconds, and he cuts off the collar  and goes to the next one.  But it's something about, I'm only going to be happy when Little Connor is something.  I'm sure no good would have come up with that.  Yeah, there's nothing nice that can come after that opening.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Forrest.  Yep.  Bye. 
[01:09:30]  I cannot believe we blew that opportunity.  I'm amazed.  I knew he was the wrong kid.  I don't know why you'd want to send him.  One block away, live shot right there.  He was there with the signs.  Somehow it didn't get on.  He's the shyest kid in the whole building.  Yeah.  He barely talks.  He might be a good kid and works hard, but he's really...  Dude, what happened?  What happened?  I was across the street.  I guess I didn't have the right vantage point.  I missed him.  The right vantage point? 
[01:10:00]  I think I know...  I can't even look at him.  I drove past that news truck on my way in.  Yeah.  If you were across the street, wasn't the truck itself blocking the view of the guy?  No.  You saw the guy.  I was across the street on...  Still on 57th.  I think the guy was in front of Pick a Bagel or one of those little bagel stands.  No, no, no, no.  That's across the street.  Yeah, he was right in front of Dwayne Reed.  I was on the other side, but I guess he was in my blind spot. 
[01:10:30]  Your blind spot?  Were you speeding by him?  I was standing on the subway.  Mirrors on your hat?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because he went live for...  There was plenty of time to get...  Did he hear us yelling, go, go, go?  Yeah, but I didn't know if that was a reference to me.  No, they told me to hold on, so I was holding.  I didn't know he was going live.  You heard us saying, go, go, go.  I'll be screaming over the song, but I didn't know that was to me. 
[01:11:00]  Dude, who else are we yelling, go, go?  Yeah, we're not fucking each other.  You are a pisser.  I love this.  I'm not even mad anymore, because this is so stupid.  What do you think I was referring to with go, go, go?  I didn't have my Wi-Fi, so I couldn't hear.  What?  I didn't have my Wi-Fi on, so I didn't know what the show was doing.  Well, what the show was doing was going to you live so you could be on live TV. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, go, go, go.  Let's say you're standing in front of a news shot, and you have signs, and you're waiting  for the live shot, and you're on hold on the phone, and you hear the hosts of the program  yell, go, go, go.  You could probably assume we're talking to you.  Well, all right, I was standing across from the van.  I did not see the cameraman come out of the van, and I was watching the van completely. 
[01:12:00]  I saw the light come on in the van.  That's when I called in the show, and then I hear, go, go, go.  Well, it wasn't me looking at Anthony as he's deep-throating his huge banana.  Go, go.  Suck it.  Suck that banana down.  No.  I thought you were saying, no, no, no.  We're slow, slow, slow.  Blow, blow, blow.  We're always here, crow.  Do they take off?  Yeah, they started cleaning up as soon as I hung up. 
[01:12:30]  As soon as you missed the shot?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  What did you think, when the big light lights came on, did you think it was a night game?  What did you think?  Yeah.  I thought maybe they were cleaning up or something.  Because when those lights come on, that means live shot.  And then when we yell, go, it means, go.  Oh, I can't even go.  We thought you might have panicked.  Like, you might have seen it come on and gotten a little nervous.  Did you think, I can't do this?  This is my big opportunity, and I blew it. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, I don't think you'll be getting a second try at this.  No.  No.  We'll find something else for you to do, I think.  Coffee runs.  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Steve is saying that you've been out there for three days with signs?  Yeah, I went down to Rockefeller yesterday.  They didn't go to my section of the crowd, though.  Well, wouldn't you, like, move yourself to where they're going?  I was only down there for, like, one segment, so.  Oh.  They only went to the crowd once when I was there.  Steve's here.  Yeah, Steve has a lot of confidence in you, though. 
[01:13:30]  Not anymore.  Oh.  Nah, I'm sorry.  Why would you, um, you did have confidence in him, though?  I did.  He seemed, uh, he said he was on the, at the, uh, Today Show yesterday, and...  Well, what, what?  I can't hear you.  Wow.  I had a hat and no headphones.  Oh.  All right.  So you have no confidence in the guy now?  Uh, sorry, Mike.  You're, you're, you're, you're back to getting coffee.  Why wouldn't you guys send Eric? 
[01:14:00]  I don't get it.  Yeah, what, why, why not send a proven guy?  Uh...  I want to play, too, Anthony.  Of course you do.  I dig this.  I want to see me, Steve.  I want to see you, Steve. 
[01:14:30]  Yes, Steve, so...  Who made that?  I don't know.  I actually think it was Drew Boogie.  Oh.  Thanks, Drew.  He does a great job on the radio program.  Thanks, Drew.  Another thing to be thrown at me while I'm trying to speak.  Yeah, great.  Uh, all right.  From now on, uh, Eric will now do these things.  Yeah, but, uh, these opportunities don't come along.  I understand that.  Well, look, there's gonna be a bunch today.  How, how far away do we want to send, uh, young Eric?  Why would there be a bunch today?  Is there something going on?  Uh, there's Giant Stadium.  Not Giant.  There's Yankee Stadium.  There's, uh, there's something going on at 27th and Broadway. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I saw that shot.  But they're, apparently, they're there for a while.  How far away do we want to send this guy?  Mm.  27th is like 30 blocks.  How far do we want to send him?  A block.  Yeah, a block.  Great opportunity.  Now, now, now, now that the, the block opportunity has, uh, gone, do we want to send him that  far away?  I, I don't even want to send him to Starbucks across the street at this point.  Why don't we do this?  Is there, can we afford to send two people out with two, two different locations?  We do have two lovely signs, although you'd have to cover them somehow. 
[01:15:30]  You couldn't put them face to face like he had them.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  That's, it's kind of depressing that we missed that one, man.  I'm so.  It was right, it was right there.  It was right there.  That was the one.  You don't get the pitch like that every, uh, every time.  All right.  Oh, there he goes.  Skull King.  Man, you guys got to figure it out.  I don't know why you would send him.  It was the perfect opportunity.  When you have Eric and other people.  You know, you know, honestly, it's, it's. 
[01:16:00]  What about Danny?  It seems so painfully brain dead.  I took, I took for granted the fact that the kid might get scared.  He might not know what was up.  So, all right.  Now everyone's got to suffer.  Everybody.  We all have to suffer now.  No, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:16:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Ah, isn't that lovely?  What's from the old gong show?  Actually, I think that was on Leno last night, right?  Yeah.  It was on Leno last night.  They were doing wacky, wacky Christmas instruments.  Yeah.  I thought it was a gong show. 
[01:17:00]  It sounds gong show-ish.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey City.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  That killed on The Tonight Show last night?  You know how depressing that is as a comedian?  Can you believe it?  It killed on The Tonight Show.  Every night you work to get material that's clean enough that makes sense enough for that  to give it a great show to do.  And that lady just kills with ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ugh.  Sorry, sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off with my ramblings.  No problem, Jimmy.  I'm going to make sure to yell at you on Thursday night.  Oh.  Where?  At the downtown. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  It's Long Island.  Thanks, fella.  No problem.  Anthony.  Yes, Mike?  How did you like the pageant last night, bro?  Oh, yes.  It was the big pageant last night.  Oh, yeah.  On the TV show The Swan.  Ugh.  The curly-haired blonde girl should have won.  She was hot.  Which one?  Curly-haired blonde sister.  That was the one that I had picked to win.  For some reason, they picked some girl that wasn't...  I didn't even have her in the final five. 
[01:18:00]  She looked like a hot soccer mom.  She was, yeah.  She was a little too old.  Yeah.  And her features were a little bizarre after the surgery.  So it was kind of weird that...  Yeah, the sister, the blonde girl, they had sisters do it, Opie.  They had sisters go through the whole treatment.  And one of them was really hot when they were done.  She had curly blonde hair, real cute face, good body.  And she didn't win.  That was the one I had pegged to win.  No.  But the...  No.  What made it worth the prize of admission was the deaf girl. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, what a train wreck.  They called me Deafie when I was growing up.  That's dope.  Her name was probably Debbie, and then she just didn't hear right.  No, we weren't being mean, you idiot.  They called me Debbie.  What's your name?  Debbie?  And we're not supposed to laugh at this while we're watching.  Oh, I know.  They do it on purpose.  Stop it.  The woman that was against Deafie, and then she says it, and it's this horrible point in 
[01:19:00]  her life when they called her Deafie.  But the second she said it, the only way I've referred to her since I saw that show was as  Deafie.  That's who she is.  Deafie.  She's Deafie now.  I think I got the audio of that.  Do you?  Let's listen.  I've been deaf since I was three years old.  When I was in school, the kids were really mean to me.  They would call me Deafie, retarded, dumb.  I'm not better than my disability. 
[01:19:30]  But when I look in the mirror, I feel handicapped because I don't feel classified as much sex.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  How are you not laughing at that?  And she comes out.  She can't, like, they come out dancing, kind of, like down the runway, looking all sexy.  And she can't hear the music, I guess, so she's completely off.  Was she off key?  Yeah, it was really bad.  And she was off the beats. 
[01:20:00]  And then they had made her up, but I guess they let her through because she was Deaf,  because she really turned out bizarre looking.  Her body was all right.  They really kind of got that in shape.  But, man, her head, she had a big, she's got this big, the great kazoo from the Flintstones head.  She had that big hairdo that looked like the girl that snuck into the White House on Mars Attacks.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know where you're going.  Okay.  Ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak, ak. 
[01:20:30]  It was awful.  And then she didn't win.  She made it into the top three, I guess.  But I definitely did not agree with the winner.  Whose house was knocked over in a hurricane?  Deafie.  Are you kidding me?  My house was knocked over?  Oh, did they come back?  They got her on the phone with her mother or something.  God stinks.  The best part.  He just stinks.  There is no God.  He already makes her deaf and then a hurricane takes out our family house. 
[01:21:00]  Knocks her house down.  He makes her a deafie.  That's like being from South Deaf.  Deafie.  I wish I could help them, but my mom, she want me to stay here.  She want my dream to come true.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Can I offer advice?  When you sound like that, talk less and suck more.  It's the first time in my life.  I can hear a lot of the phone.  It's great.  I think they have a clip of her when she looks at herself in the mirror. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, okay.  Which is the best part of the swan show.  Right.  They stand in front of a curtain.  There's a mirror behind it.  And they haven't seen themselves since the whole thing started.  They remove all mirrors from the hotel they stay in.  And the curtain opens up.  And for the first time, they get to look at themselves.  And they lose their minds.  They just lose their minds.  I'm beautiful.  Oh, slow down.  We got an audio of that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:00]  Me?  Oh, my goodness.  Look at me.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Shut up.  What a hot voice that is.  Ah, do me.  Those stupid wide deaf girl eyes trying to take in as much of one of the other senses as humanly possible.  Oh, God.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  They are beautiful.  Oh, just stop. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Don't talk.  Yeah.  We had a deaf family that lived next door to us when we lived in East Northport.  Wow.  And they used to get in fights all the time.  They would get in fights.  First, they'd be on the front lawn signing to each other.  So violently, you would hear them, like, slapping the signs into their hands.  And then they would lose it, I guess, and just start going,  Bizarre. 
[01:23:00]  Look outside and go, what the hell is going on out there?  And there's the deaf family yelling at each other.  What the hell are they arguing about?  All right.  So you enjoyed the swan last night?  Oh, I stayed up late to watch it.  They had the swimsuit competition, which is great, because some of these girls are just a world of hurt.  And they do lipo on them and get them down into the gym and stuff. 
[01:23:30]  But some of them, you know, do better than others.  And you could tell, the ones they put the one piece on to parade out, kind of have that front panel to keep the bunt in.  The bunt panel.  The shield.  The shield.  The twat shield.  All right.  It's a guilty pleasure for you, and it's now over until next year.  Over until the, yes, next year, the swan.  I have a question. 
[01:24:00]  Do you ever see, speaking of deaf people, I forgot, in The Company of Men, it's about this really pretty deaf girl,  and there's these two buddies, and they take a bet on who's going to get to bang her first.  She works in the office.  Yeah.  And the one guy who winds up hooking up with her is better looking, but he's an abusive scumbag.  Not physically, but just he's a real creep.  And then the other guy winds up falling in love with it.  It's really good, but there's some brutal dialogue in that.  Really?  Brutal.  Yeah, I got that at home.  I've got to get clips of that.  Yeah, bring it in.  We'll listen to that. 
[01:24:30]  We love brutal.  All right, we've got to go back to Syracuse, Anthony, and talk to Dominic.  Dominic, what's going on?  Hey, I'm up in Syracuse.  All right.  Monkey sausage.  All right.  No, I said hello to Anthony last night.  Oh, that was you on the game?  Yeah, I had to stop over and say hello.  Listened to the repeat last night.  On EverQuest 2, Opie, I have a lot of people now stopping by and saying hello with wacky  names like Dominic here.  He came up as donkey sausage.  And I have another friend, Lil' Connor. 
[01:25:00]  And then Connor Peterson, who did nothing but type mommy with a question mark the whole  night.  He's just typing mommy, mommy.  Sick bastard.  You and your geek friends.  Jesus.  Absolutely.  All right.  So I'm up in Syracuse.  They're replaying the same bit over and over.  They're doing two for Tuesday.  And then they're cutting in with a bit about how you guys are taking over for Howard while 
[01:25:30]  he's on vacation.  So they're playing the same bit over and over again?  They're doing a two for and then putting that on, like a little trailer.  Interesting.  Well, turn up the radio.  Let's hear what they're playing right now.  If that's just going to spread.  Yeah, I do believe that's going to spread.  Yeah, I do believe that's Tylenol and lay down in bed.  You know what the beauty is?  Today we started our show like just another normal show.  All the other high-profile radio DJs in America have pretty much taken these two weeks 
[01:26:00]  off.  But we know we can't take time off.  We have to.  All right.  We have to.  They're playing yesterday's show is what they're doing.  In different order, though, it seems like.  They're just cutting it up.  Who knows what they're doing.  All right.  Well, we're on.  All right, we're on.  It's a little more gooder than yesterday's train wreck that they had up there.  So we'll see how it develops in the coming days, okay?  Absolutely.  Thank you, Dominic, for the update.  No problem.  All right.  I got kicked out of a group last night also on my game.  I was kicked out of a group because the leader of the group got the whole group killed twice 
[01:26:30]  in 15 minutes.  And I commented on it.  I was like, hey.  He went up to these giants and pulled two at a time when we could barely take one at a  time.  And he pulled two.  So it happened once, fine.  It happened twice.  And I'm like, I start yelling at the guy, going, please don't do that again, sir.  Please don't pull two of these beasts that we cannot possibly defeat.  You didn't really yell if you used the word please.  I did.  I did say please.  Yes, I did.  They were yelling then.  And then they kicked me out of the group. 
[01:27:00]  And there I was just walking away from the group, looking over my shoulder as they're  battling on.  And I was shunned.  You're even a loner in the cyber world.  I know.  I felt like a total loser.  I know.  I should have felt that way before.  The minute the log on screen came up and you didn't put your fist to the screen, they  kicked you out of the cyber world.  I was so dejected.  And then I sat there a while, just watching the group, hoping they got killed again so 
[01:27:30]  I could type in, ha, ha.  But they didn't, of course.  So you didn't get your revenge?  No.  Couldn't you get back in the group?  Well, come on, guys.  Bastards.  That was me in the game, just walking away slowly, looking back, seeing them defeating  another giant as I leave, dejected.  And you were trying not to look behind you, but you couldn't help it.  I couldn't help it.  You had a look a few times.  I had to spin that mouse around and take a little look behind me and look at everybody 
[01:28:00]  looking at me walking away.  Did they wave goodbye?  No, they were very mean.  Very mean.  I was just questioning the guy's ability to pull mobs over to our area.  So what happens when you get kicked out of a group in the cyber world and you have to  walk away?  Well, first of all, I'm in the middle of very hostile territory, so I had to walk out of  there without a group, which is very dangerous, Opie.  Very dangerous indeed.  And then I have to go and find another group.  And by doing that, you have to shout throughout the zone, it's called.  You type in shout, you know. 
[01:28:30]  And then you say, yeah, 23 wizard looking for a group.  And you know that they're reading it laughing because now you're looking for another group  because they kicked you out of theirs.  And they know why you're looking for a group because you got kicked out of the other one.  Because I got kicked out of that one.  But it wasn't my fault.  The guy was an ass.  I wish I could remember his name.  Did he have the wizard robe on?  I haven't earned it yet.  Oh, okay.  I have one more step in my quest to get the wizard robe.  I did acquire the shoulder pad things that I, my wizard shoulder pads and gloves and bracers. 
[01:29:00]  And I'm working on my pants and my robe.  What are bracers?  They keep the knees steady?  No, they're wrists.  They go on your arms and have some type of magical properties.  Yeah.  And there I was, wearing them, walking away from the group that I was kicked out of on EverQuest 2.  Very sad.  Dick.  All right.  Let's go to Oceanside and say hi to Anthony.  Hey, Anthony, what's up?  Not too much.  Hey, boys. 
[01:29:30]  What's up, Anthony?  Oh, jeez.  Hey, tool.  Yeah, exactly.  That old tag.  Hello, pancake kids.  Hi, Angel.  Listen, watching that swan last night, you know, the before and after shots with my wife  and the three fucking kids she's still stuck on before.  Oh, it looked hot.  Oh, yeah.  They were doing some special effect at the end of the show, too, where they would take  the before.  And obviously, they took all of the girls before they had the surgery and told them to walk 
[01:30:00]  down this runway thing and stop.  Because on the pageant, they have the before girl superimposed next to the girl now, walking  down the runway with each other.  So you just see this mess of a slob walking next to this girl that's, you know, moderately  hot now that they did the work on her.  I got the face of Duffy down.  You know who she looks like, right?  Who?  Spy versus Spy.  Spy versus Spy.  Oh, no way.  Really?  Yeah.  They really could have done a little more work on her. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, they call me Duffy.  They call me Duffy.  Well, now the whole country will, too, you dummy.  And how did she know what they were calling her anyway unless they wrote it down and held  it up?  They probably did, cruel little bastards.  Stop reading lips, nosy.  They call me nosy.  That's funny.  All right.  Let's take a quick break here.  We got a mash-up, Anthony, that a lot of people really, really like.  It's Green Day and Oasis getting together for this little number, and we'll continue.  We'll continue. 
[01:31:00]  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known.  Don't know where it goes, but it's only me and I walk along. 
[01:31:30]  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.  I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams.  Where the city sleeps, and I'm the only one that I walk along.  By now, you should've somehow realized what you gotta do.  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do. 
[01:32:00]  I'm the only one that I walk along.  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me.  Until then, I walk along.  Every day I wake up, but it's Sunday. 
[01:32:30]  But I'm the only one that I want to go.  And I'm the only one that I was playing, and I'm the only one.  And I'm the only one that I want to go.  Backbeat, the word is on the street, that the fire in your heart is out.  I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt. 
[01:33:00]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.  I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind.  On the borderline of the edge and where I walk around.  Today is going to be the day that they're going to throw it back to you. 
[01:33:30]  Between the lines, what's up and everything's all right.  Check my vital signs and know I'm still alive and I walk around.  Today is going to be the day that they're going to throw it back to you.  By now you should have somehow realized what you've got to do.  And all the roads we have as you walk are winding.  And all the lights I need is there are blinding. 
[01:34:00]  There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how.  I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams.  Today is going to be the day that they're going to throw it back to you.  I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams. 
[01:34:30]  By now you should have somehow realized what you've got to do.  Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one who  Walk out there is my shadow.  The only one who walks me so that they think  But you don't want to see all the girls  That's where they think  I'm still alive and I'm still alive and I'm still alive and I'm still alive and I'm still alive and I'm still alive and I'm still alive. 
[01:35:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:35:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:36:00]  Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German, the word fricken, which means to strike.  In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories.  As a transitive verb, for instance, John fucked Shirley.  As an intransitive verb, Shirley fucks.  Its meaning's not always sexual.  It can be used as an adjective, such as, John's doing all the fucking work.  As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too fucking much. 
[01:36:30]  As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, Shirley is fucking beautiful.  As a noun, I don't give a fuck.  As part of a word, abso-fucking-lutely, or in-fucking-credible.  And, as almost every word in a sentence, fuck the fucking fuckers.  As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck.  As in these examples, describing situations such as,  Fraud, I got fucked at the used car lot. 
[01:37:00]  Dismay, aw, fuck it.  Trouble, I guess I'm really fucked now.  Aggression, don't fuck with me, buddy.  Difficulty, I don't understand this fucking question.  Inquiry, who the fuck was that?  Dissatisfaction, I don't like what the fuck is going on here.  Incompetence, he's a fuck-off.  Dismissal, why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself? 
[01:37:30]  I'm sure you can think of many more examples.  With all of these multi-purpose applications,  how can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique, flexible word more often than your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  Fuck you.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:38:00]  Hey, this is a big fuck you to Mike.  Who doesn't listen to the show in the morning like he should.  He listens to it four hours later and then he fucking bugged me in the afternoon about,  Hey, did you hear what happened to Opie and Anthony?  Fuck you.  Fuck you to the fucking red-headed fucking cunt  that wants to start a bunch of fucking shit.  You suck my fucking dick.  Oh, that's right.  It's not black enough for you, you fucking whore.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I just got a big F.U. out to Howard Stern. 
[01:38:30]  He started stealing the laugh that you guys got from the guy in Massachusetts.  Yeah, I got a fuck you to give out to whoever the fuck sent my sticker back.  No, I said sticker.  I fucking sent you guys an envelope on Friday.  I wrote a little note that,  Hey, can I get a couple stickers, you know?  I got fucking more than one car.  I got a work truck and they give me one fucking cat fucking sticker. 
[01:39:00]  What the fuck am I going to do with one fucking sticker?  How am I going to spread the fucking virus with one sticker?  I can't give one sticker to my buddies that was a radio station or, you know,  a fucking mother sticker for my work vehicle, you fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big F.U. to the town of Milledgeville, Illinois,  and especially to the town board.  Stupid people don't know they're stupid.  But fuck you.  Here's a big F.U. to Jared. 
[01:39:30]  Fuck you, you fucking baby.  How about a little bit of cheese with that wine?  Yeah, I used to have a big F.U. out there  and all the fucking teachers and all the fucking staff  that can lick my fucking hairy sack and blow my big balls.  And I used to have an extra big F.U. out there  to that fucking alcoholic, cunt fucking English teacher  who fucking can't get a lazy ass off her fucking couch  and to fucking follow up her hand and fucking pass a student.  This is Connor Peterson. 
[01:40:00]  I want to give that big F.U. to my father, Scott.  You fucking cock, fucking bastard.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the O.B. at the F.U. line at 1-866-FU-9-1.  1-866-FU-9-1.  Fuck you very much.  What if you could give the ultimate Major League Baseball fan  access to every team all season long?  Now you can.  The game that grew up on the radio

The people interested in,  oh, no, just flowers.  I want people at my funeral when I die.  I'm going to pay some bitches to cry at my funeral.  I want hollering and shit. 
[01:41:30]  Wow, Jesus, take me with him, take me with him.  Get your ass in there.  And niggas take pictures at the funerals and shit, right?  Niggas, wait a minute.  Get over by the casket bar.

[01:42:30]  From a straight foul ball,  Joe DiMaggio hit the count.  It was 0 and 2.  I'll never forget the sound he made  when I bawled him in the lips.  He tried to cuss and tried to swear.  The only thing he said was this.  Ah! 
[01:43:00]  Ah!  You okay, Grandpa?  Ah!  Sing along if you know it.  Ah!  About this time of night,  you'd know that word, wouldn't you?  Ah!  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  XM 202. 
[01:43:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, we're back.  All right, we're back. 
[01:44:00]  We're back with the O&A virus spreading across America,  making headlines every single day, Anthony.  Another one just came in about our move to commercial radio.  Everyone trying to figure out what does it mean for us,  what does it mean for the radio industry.  Yes, indeed.  We don't know what the fuck it means.  All we know is we got together with an old pal, Farid,  and he said, hey, you want to do a little something in Syracuse?  Help me out a little bit.  We hate Howard.  We want Howard off our stations, and we want you guys to replace Howard.  Right.  We don't know if we can get out of his deal, 
[01:44:30]  but we know that we could run your show in his place during vacation time.  Mm-hmm.  What I like about this move is that we're just wrecking his vacation.  Yeah.  He's not going to be a happy camper knowing that we came in  during the time that they were supposed to be playing his best of  and playing our show.  Well, this just came in.  XM's Opie and Anthony could be on your local AM or FM radio dial  in the near future.  But in the meantime, they're no doubt ruining part of Howard Stern's 
[01:45:00]  long-planned vacation as they sub for him on Citadel's 95X in Syracuse.  Nice.  So the story is slowly but surely spreading across America, Anthony.  Yes.  You were saying that your Christmas shopping is done, huh?  Done.  Done.  Done this year.  And you did the gift cards?  Yeah.  Took a lot of thought.  It actually did because, I don't know,  I've always been one of the guys that kind of like the getting presents  for people thing. 
[01:45:30]  Then you go and hook up with the family and friends,  and you give the presents, and they open them, and you watch,  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So why the laziness this year?  I just had it.  I can't be bothered with the shopping,  going out to these malls, standing in long lines, waiting.  You ever try to walk in a crowded mall,  and you get the old people that are four abreast,  they don't get out of your way?  Like, it's stuff like that I can't handle anymore. 
[01:46:00]  Can't take it.  And I just kept putting it off, knowing I just wouldn't do it.  So American Express gift cards.  Nice.  Found that one, and got those.  Why not?  Who doesn't like?  It's pretty much cash without being as tacky as just handing them some money.  You know, because that's kind of, eh.  You know, you don't want to just hand people money.  I think it's kind of the same thing, actually.  No, but it's like the Walt Whitman Mall out on Long Island.  Now you can just get the gift cards for the whole mall.  So isn't that like just giving cash? 
[01:46:30]  It is, yeah.  What's the difference?  You go to the ATM, you take out whatever, $1,000, let's say,  and you hand it over to some people in your family for Christmas.  Or you wait in line for an hour just so you can have the gift card  because it looks a little nicer.  Didn't even have to wait in line for these.  Oh, the American Express thing?  You get them at the bank.  You just go in there, and you're done.  Why wouldn't everybody do this?  Screw the presents and opening.  Oh, and then you get something that you don't want, 
[01:47:00]  and you feel bad because you don't want it.  Yeah, you know what?  So then you feel guilty, and you've got to make like you like it.  I think holidays are for the young.  For the kids.  I think like when you're still dressing up for Halloween,  and you're older, and you're worrying about  if you're going to get good gifts at Christmas.  I don't know.  I just don't get it.  The older I get, I don't get it anymore.  I don't care what I get.  Like it doesn't, I don't want anything. 
[01:47:30]  I don't want anything.  I know.  Because I get all awkward and weird  because I know people don't really know me,  and then they're not going to get me anything I really like,  so then I have to fake it when I'm opening stuff.  Yeah.  And I'm sure they think the same way.  I don't want to think I'm the only pompous one.  I think everyone has that feeling.  You start feeling all weird.  Yeah.  You open up stuff.  You're like, I'm never going to wear this sweater.  Oh, I could use this.  Right.  Oh, thank you.  And then they're like, well, I got you a Knicks jersey  because I know you like basketball.  Well, yeah, but I don't want to wear a Knicks jersey. 
[01:48:00]  I'm not a wigger, you know?  Yo, B.  It's always the logic of getting you the gift is always a little strange.  Well, I thought I'd get you this.  Yeah.  Well, you're into video games, so I got you.  And it's just the worst game ever.  It's always a game you'll never play.  Oh, fishing.  Because all the games.  The fishing video game.  Because all the games you would play are sold out or whatever,  so, you know, they don't know that.  They're like, oh, that looks cool.  He'll enjoy this.  And I have all the games that I want because I get them when they come out. 
[01:48:30]  So if anyone's going to get me a game, it's probably something I don't want.  If I wanted it, I would have gotten it.  And there was a, what the hell was it, something a couple of years ago,  one of my relatives had asked my girlfriend, what did I want?  And she was like, I don't know.  You know, you could get some kind of DVDs of, like, war documentaries,  which is cool.  You hang out.  There's nothing on TV.  Pop one of those in.  You could watch, you know, some gooks get shot up in Vietnam or something. 
[01:49:00]  I don't know.  It's entertaining.  And so that's what she told the relative.  And what did I get?  One of those huge coffee table books on, like, the Civil War.  Ugh.  I'm like, what?  I want to pop in a DVD and watch, like, planes duking it out above the Pacific.  I don't want to read about Gettysburg.  And how good was your acting? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh.  I held my hands up in front of my face and fanned my face going, oh.  My little hot dog thumb wiggling.  It just stinks.  It is.  It's awful.  But that's a prime example of what happens.  And you know the people that you get things for are doing the same thing.  Yeah, I have no doubt in my mind.  Oh, this is beautiful.  You know, it's like, why bother then?  And we also, last year, got all the women in the family, we got them something from Tiffany. 
[01:50:00]  You know?  Not the knockoff box that some people get and put other stuff in.  You know, the real from Tiffany.  And you get the act of, like, oh, this is beautiful.  And then it starts creeping in.  Yeah, I don't really wear these that much, like a bracelet or something like that.  But, oh, I could go back.  I could take it back.  I'll just, I'll take it back. 
[01:50:30]  And then you're at the point where you might as well just give them cash.  Just get, here's some cash.  Go to Tiffany.  Go to wherever you want.  If you think most people aren't happy with their Christmas gifts, all you have to do is go to the mall the day after Christmas.  Yeah, there you go.  What explains the huge crowd of people taking crap back?  And they can't get to the mall fast enough to bring your junk back.  Your gift sucked so bad.  So bad they couldn't even wait a day.  Just go there.  The lines are out the door.  I don't even want this in my house for a day. 
[01:51:00]  Because you always go, well, just in case I got the gift receipt or whatever.  And you go, oh, no, I think I could wear this.  I like it.  Yeah, as soon as you leave, you're waking up at 5 a.m. to beat the crowd in the mall to get what you want.  Take it back and get what you want, you selfish bastards.  I don't take anything back.  I don't think I've ever taken back a gift.  They just end up in a closet somewhere, never used, and then eventually when you move, they get lost or thrown out or something.  But I never take anything back because I hate going to the mall, whether it's to buy stuff or give it back. 
[01:51:30]  They're just awful places full of horrid people.  Everyone is always in my way.  I've got such a problem with people in my way.  Whether it's traffic or at the mall, people just can't move fast.  You just don't like to be around people.  I really don't.  I guess that's right.  And it's gotten worse over the years.  I have my crowd that I like hanging out with, my peeps, and anyone else I really can't be bothered with because they annoy the piss out of me. 
[01:52:00]  I don't like being inconvenienced in any way whatsoever.  And if that's me being stuck in traffic, I am convinced it's because some asshole isn't driving properly.  Or if I'm behind somebody, if I'm in a long line at a store, it's some jack-off is up there trying to fish change out or writing a goddamn check they hadn't filled out or screwing something up.  How about the guy that, I see this a lot lately, people that have to use their credit cards at like Starbucks. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That happened to me over the weekend.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding.  Your coffee's $2 or whatever it is.  I don't know.  Yeah, and they're pulling their pen out.  They're pulling out an actual credit card.  Yeah.  Signing.  Lay some cash down.  And every time I get up to the point in the line where people finally, I'm up at the front of the line, it takes two seconds.  I'm never standing there bitching that I have a coupon for a nickel off and why aren't you taking it? 
[01:53:00]  When you stand in these stores and these old bitchy women are complaining because they're supposed to get another nickel or $0.08 off of the item.  That happens at the drugstore a lot.  All the time.  A lot.  This was supposed to be on sale?  You advertise this as being $0.78 and why am I paying $0.85 if I will punch you in the uterus and leave the change in there? 
[01:53:30]  You bitch.  Move.  It is a big inconvenience.  It's all about me, me, me.  You're not that important.  Pay the extra money and leave.  It's not like $10 or something.  It's $0.07.  Right.  Well, why don't you get your girlfriend the Liberator this year, Anthony?  The Liberator?  I can't believe you haven't heard about the Liberator yet.  I have never heard of this thing.  They're advertising this in the back of almost every magazine now.  But now it's in a regular newspaper. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, this was in the New York Post today.  You haven't heard about the Liberator?  Cure Common what?  What does that ad say?  Cure Common Liberator.  I don't know.  It just says Cure Common.  Cure Common?  It's the headline that says Liberator adds...  It's supposed to spice up your sex life?  Well, the Liberator adds dimension to your bed that elevates lovers for convenient access  and targeted contact.  What?  Yep.  You've never heard of the Liberator?  It looks like a big cheese wedge. 
[01:54:30]  It's a cushion?  Yeah, it's like a cheese wedge cushion.  A wedge-shaped cushion.  The only way to explain it.  It looks like it's got hatches on it.  What the hell is...  So then the lady lays her belly on the Liberator and her head is way down and her butt is way  up.  That's the part of the wedge that goes way up.  And then you, yeah, you mount from behind and gives you convenient access and targeted  contact, Anthony.  This is specifically made for backdoor action. 
[01:55:00]  Doggy style, yeah.  Offering scores of positions to explore.  They also come with...  Wait.  Scores of positions?  I'm thinking only one position if you use the Liberator.  Well, wait a minute.  She could lay the other way, right?  Uh-huh.  Hang her head off the high end of the wedge, and then you could walk up to her.  How are you doing?  Uh-huh.  Offering scores of positions to explore.  They also come with washable covers so you can get freaky with lotions, potions, and gourmet  notions.  Yeah, because that's why it's washable. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Not from the splooge that'll be all over it.  Eric, see if you can get them on the phone, because it says for a free guide, call 1-800-blah-blah-blah.  Ooh.  I want to talk to the people that make the Liberator today.  The Liberator?  Why would they even name it that?  But it's a big cheese wedge, and I guess you just keep it in the closet, and then what?  You've got to pull that thing out.  Hey, honey.  We've discussed this.  You know?  Honey?  Honey, I got the Liberator out.  We're hanging over the Liberator.  Get ready for some real action. 
[01:56:00]  And you pop it on your bed and just bang over it?  Yeah.  That's too much.  It's one of those things we've discussed, you know?  A lot of these things you use for sex.  Yeah, the props.  Props.  They sound good at the time, but then as soon as the orgasms are complete, you kind of look  at each other, and it's kind of awkward, no?  You feel silly.  You've got to clean the cushions.  Right.  And pack it up.  Put all the dildos in the dishwasher.  Until next time.  They aren't selling that thing as something else, like a pillow?  No, this one, no. 
[01:56:30]  Like some things they sell as regular items, and you know that they're meant for sex?  Like the back massagers in Brookstone?  The back massager.  It's a dildo.  Right.  It's a cylinder-shaped with a big vibrating head, but they're trying to claim it's for  your back.  And the advertising picture is a woman smiling, holding it to the back of her neck?  Yeah.  I think you missed, honey.  Yeah, that's not what she wants to hold it.  No, they're not even fooling around with this one.  It's all about getting the woman in the perfect position for backdoor sex. 
[01:57:00]  And you're liberating what?  You're liberating the woman.  You're liberating your sex life?  Because I guess a lot of women out there don't get their G-spot hit.  And that's supposed to do it, huh?  Yeah, and maybe a lot of women are a little too shy to tell the guy, hey, you're missing  by a foot.  You might want to move it this way.  And you don't want to put the pillows that you're going to be laying your head on under  there?  Is that it?  I guess not.  Getting all kinds of junk on there?  I guess not.  So now they have the liberator.  Hey, congrats.  Yeah, that makes a great gift, I guess.  Know what to get grandma. 
[01:57:30]  Hello?  Yes.  Who's this?  This is Connie.  How can I help you?  Connie, did they tell you you're going to be on the radio?  No, they did not.  You know, my people need to be fired.  Dump out of that.  You can take her off now.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Will you talk to Connie, make sure she knows she's going on the radio?  I actually dumped out of that, Opie.  We had to dump out of that?  I hit the dump button.  Did it work?  Hopefully.  Hopefully, hopefully I got it all.  Does the room over there understand that people can't be put on the air unless they know that 
[01:58:00]  they're going to be on the radio?  Maybe we should have taken this week off.  Holy.  Because everyone is asleep around us.  How are they not informing?  That's rule one.  That's rule one.  Rule one.  When you get into radio and you get the big book of radio rules, guess what rule one is?  Well, now she's ready, right?  All right, now Eric's yelling at me through the headphones.  Connie.  Yes.  Okay, you're live on the radio with Opie and Anthony, okay? 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  And we saw the ad in the, I guess it was the New York Post here in New York.  Maybe the Daily News, I don't know.  They're pretty much the same stupid paper.  Bunch of junk in both of them.  But a nice little advertisement for the Deliberator.  Yes, sir, it is.  It's the cushion that is, I don't know, in the shape of a cheese wedge for the lady, right?  Yes, sir.  We have four specially designed portable cushions that allow couples to experience new positions. 
[01:59:00]  Really?  Four cushions?  Yes, sir.  Four shapes.  And explain what the cushions look like.  I'm describing like a cheese wedge.  Well, that's, we have a cube that's just like a square block, and it's just for leaning  on or sitting against.  Yeah.  We have the stage, and it's just a small cushion, like for a bed cushion.  Large, large.  And then we have the wedge and the ramp, and both of those are triangle shape. 
[01:59:30]  Triangle shape.  That's where you get that wedge where some parts of the body will be a little higher than  others.  That's correct.  And that's supposed to be a good thing.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, my pal Anthony's not too sure how this Liberator thing works, so what, the lady lays  down on her belly?  Either way you want.  You just use your imagination.  Oh.  Now, Connie, do you have any experience with the Liberator?  I do have mine.  I've not used it yet.  It's on the way, but we do get quite a few orders. 
[02:00:00]  The one that's most popular is called the Wedge Ramp Combo, and that's where you can get  both the triangle shapes together.  I think that's what I'm seeing, the small triangle and the big triangle.  That is correct.  Basically, the small triangle is where she could rest her head, right?  You can use it as a pillow.  While you're just pounding her ass.  Either way.  Right.  And I see zippers on these things.  They have two covers.  The inside cover is like a silky covering, and then the outside is a velvet covering. 
[02:00:30]  And the zipper, obviously, so you can remove it, so you can throw it in the washing machine  to get all the splooge stains off, right?  That is correct.  Right.  Hey, is yours going to come with an ashtray?  How much do you smoke, ma'am?  Well, we won't answer that one.  Yeah, maybe you ought to get off the cigarettes.  I heard that.  Yeah.  Holler.  Well, so why did you decide to get the Liberator? 
[02:01:00]  Well, as I said, it's just to explore new positions.  Yeah, and do you need to explore new positions in your relationship?  Well, we can always.  Yeah, that's true.  How long have you been married, Connie?  31 years.  31 years young.  I mean, 31 years married.  That's correct.  And you want to get your big old ass up in the air for your husband, right?  I guess.  You can say whatever you want.  Is your husband excited that this is on the way?  I'm sure he is.  Really? 
[02:01:30]  How do you know he's excited?  Does he know where your G-spot is?  Well, after 31 years, if they don't, I'm in trouble.  Right.  That's true.  And he knows how to hit it, hit it good?  I guess we do.  Hit it, hit it.  Hit it good, yeah.  That's wonderful.  She's going to have her big old ass up in the air, and her husband's going to be pounding  away from behind, hitting her G-spot.  Are you both in shape?  I guess so.  I know how to take care of business. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, I like that in a woman.  Yeah, what's your favorite move in bed?  I think I prefer to keep most of that to myself.  Oh.  What, you just play with yourself?  No, I said my preferability to my sex position.  Ah.  Hey, what is the Liberator going to set me back?  Well, each of the shapes have a different price.  What about if I want the big wedge, small wedge combo?  That's $175 and $20 shipping. 
[02:02:30]  But couldn't you just use the cushions from your couch?  Well, you can, but these, you won't be sliding around, or the cushions won't be moving while  you're going about your business.  I have a question for you, too.  The Liberator, because of the shape, is if, say a girl, and I'm being very speculative here,  but just say a girl is passed out, and you need her in a certain position, would the Liberator  be more likely to keep her from jostling about?  That's what I said.  You don't slide around, and the cushions don't move while you're having sex. 
[02:03:00]  But I'm saying if she was, like, incapacitated and passed out, because, like, you use the  one wedge to get the hips in the air and liberate her of her dignity, and then you put the face  on the other wedge to keep the breathing free.  Because sometimes if somebody's passed out, their face is in a pillow, it's hard for them  to breathe.  They don't want them snoring, either.  Well, yeah, then there are other charges.  Well, now, I've not been asleep having my sex, so I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, is this good for the anal sex, too? 
[02:03:30]  Yes, sir, it is.  Oh.  Any experience with that, Connie?  Well, keep our comments to our set.  Ah, that's a yes.  That's a yes, Connie.  All right, Connie.  After 31 years, you've got to imagine you gave that up a little bit there, right?  Of course.  Well, if you don't have an imagination, you won't last 31 years.  It was either that or he went after a 15-year-old girl.  Not quite, but a little bit.  So, no, people are buying this for the anal sex, huh?  Well, as I said, you just have to use your own imagination. 
[02:04:00]  There's quite a few positions.  But how about...  Each of the cushions do come with a position guide.  Oh.  A position guide.  That's handy.  All right.  Yeah, what other positions are they using this for?  I'm just imagining a girl's butt up in the air.  Nice.  Okay.  What else?  Go ahead and imagine.  Oh, really?  Well, what's the guide say?  You have a guide you send.  So what are some of the ones the guide may suggest?  Oh, well, I don't have the guide in front of me, but, again, you can just use your own imagination. 
[02:04:30]  Connie, how did you get into selling these?  Well, I work for the call center that, you know, we have the account for Liberator Shakes.  Right.  You sell other things there at the call center?  No, not through Liberator, no.  Oh, you just sell the Liberator.  Wow, I'm looking at another picture on the website.  Oh, my goodness.  Looks like he's ready to mount.  Too bad you can't send the girl, too, the models.  Well, I guess. 
[02:05:00]  Very.  Yeah, I would assume you're one of the models, too?  Just wish.  Just wish.  Do you wish or do we wish?  No, I wish.  Ah, I see.  Yeah, she really is a cute one.  What's that, miss?  I said, afraid not.  All right, well, I'm seeing nude pictures.  Yeah, now we're seeing the nude pictures of the Liberator in action.  Right.  Have you, uh...  Whoa, I didn't know you could do that position.  Connie.  Have you looked at this website, Connie?  Yes, I have. 
[02:05:30]  Wow, you're pretty free-spirited, aren't you?  Well, in order to sell these, you have to kind of have an imagination and free spirit.  Yeah, I'm just...  Go ahead.  No, I'm just looking at this one picture here of the blue.  They come in different colors, the covers?  Yes, they do.  So, if the one is blue, so after you're finished, it will look like a sky with clouds on it.  Well, if you don't know how to wash it, it might.  Yeah.  All right, well, that looks wonderful.  I guess we'll be getting more information. 
[02:06:00]  What do you got to do?  Get our address?  Hey, sure.  You want to go ahead and place an order?  You just want the brochure sent to you.  I think we want the brochure.  Well, the one position that I'm concerned with, because a lot of people, I think, are misconstruing this, that it's only used for one style of sex.  And one of the pictures that was amazing, the guy is laying back on his back on the Liberator, and his head is kind of propped up, while the girl is...  While the girl is what, Jimmy?  I'm trying to say this politely.  All right.  Then why are you biting your fist really hard? 
[02:06:30]  You know what I'm talking about.  He's kind of sitting up with his back up, and she's sucking his cock.  Okay.  Yeah, is this good for sucking cock?  Well, evidently so.  You're washing it.  Wow.  The Liberator's good for sucking cock, Anthony.  All right.  Thank God for that.  That's right.  Liberate me of a load.  Stopping you.  All right, Con, anything else you want to tell us about the Liberator?  I think a lot of our listeners want, you know, one of these for their lovely wife. 
[02:07:00]  Is this just for traditional couples, or can shit-ticks use it?  Anybody that wants to have different sex positions and experience, you know, different sex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, it even works with the, you know, what I'm talking about, kind of the goddamn queers.  I guess they can.  Yeah.  We have a lot.  We have them for lesbians, people that are straight, and gay.  Look at this picture.  There's a picture here on the website. 
[02:07:30]  The one girl's on her.  She's got, like, complete, like, in a doggy-style position, but he's kind of, like, got her Liberator  up on the bed, and he's got his face buried in her cheeks.  Right.  He's, like, ass-eating.  He's, like, tonguing her asshole while she's hunched over the Liberator.  And she's kind of moaning as his tongue is in and out of her brown eye.  Okay.  Yeah, is it good for the ass-munching?  Evidently so, sir.  Again, you can use it for, you know, experiencing new positions, and you can put them in the 
[02:08:00]  floor, on the bed, on the couch, on the table, whatever you want to use it for.  I love Connie.  She is unflappable.  Connie just doesn't care.  You are great.  All right, Connie.  Is it good for sink fucking?  If you can fit it in there.  Yeah.  Well, I know a guy that likes to do that in hotel rooms.  Yeah, we have a guy that calls the show.  He likes to fuck the sinks when he's on tour.  He goes into hotel rooms and lays on the sink and puts his, you know, his junk into the sink  and lays on the counter. 
[02:08:30]  And then he spanks it and doesn't have to worry about cleanup.  Well, that's one way of doing it.  That's pretty resourceful, I would say.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Connie.  So...  Hey, you've been great.  You've given us a lot of worthwhile information, and if we could get a brochure, that would  be fantastic.  Okay.  And whose name are you going to put this in?  Ben Sparks.  Everybody's going to talk at once.  Ben Sparks.  Yeah.  Okay.  One second, sir.  What's the address?  It's 111 57th Street. 
[02:09:00]  West.  I'm sorry.  111 West 57th Street.  Fifth floor.  Suite 500.  Suite 500.  New York, New York.  And what's the zip?  1-0-0-1-9.  1-0-0-1.  I don't know why I'm repeating it unless you didn't hear it.  And make sure you send the brochure for the gay sex positions, all right?  Great.  Okay.  And whose name again?  Ben Sparks.  Okay.  Yeah.  I got it down.  He's got a huge hog.  It's awful.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  He has, like, one of those retard hogs.  It looks like he's smuggling...  You might have a lot of enjoyment out of these, Ben.  Oh.  Oh, look at you, Ben, huh?  His cock is known as the liberator.  It liberates women of their walking abilities.  Okay.  Now, you might need to get more than one set of liberators, Ben.  Oh.  Yeah.  True.  One for him, one for the girl, and one for his hogs.  That's right.  Yeah.  Hey, can you pile up these liberators so you can kind of have sex in between the two liberators? 
[02:10:00]  Ooh.  If you can manage to keep them still.  Hey, Connie, you like the big hogs or the little hogs?  Well, we'll keep my preferability to myself again.  Joe, let's just say I bet Connie's happy with her husband.  Yes.  Evidently so.  Yeah.  Where are you, Connie?  Are you in New York?  No, sir.  I'm in Georgia.  Oh, okay.  Georgia.  You're a Georgia peach.  Yes, sir.  Ha, ha.  That's a little rotten.  Oh, bae.  All right.  Did you get all the info you need?  I've got Ben Sparks, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019. 
[02:10:30]  Can you throw something a little special in there for him?  Yes, sir.  And also, let me get the email address.  Yes, it's Yellow Trees.  Can we hear you?  Yellow Trees.  No.  You want Ben.Sparks at XM.com?  Yeah.  Just give him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's a...  Excuse me.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is not for listeners to email Ben about his big cock.  This is only for Connie.  Ben.Sparks. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  Ben.Sparks at XM.Radio.com.  I think that's it.  By the way, this is not for listeners to write about Ben's big duties or his big delicious  cock.  Or if you have some gossip that you want to pass on to Ben.  This is nothing to do with gossip.  Nothing like that.  Your phone would never quit ringing, right?  Oh, wow.  No, this is only for Connie.  You listeners out there, don't even think about annoying Ben, because he'd hate that.  He really would.  He really would.  Yes, I would.  Do you miss Carlo? 
[02:11:30]  Me?  Connie?  Go ahead.  Oh, I thought you knew Carlo.  No.  Who?  No.  I'm afraid not.  Carlo Rizzi.  No.  No?  Oh, okay.  I thought you might have known him.  No.  No.  All right.  All right.  Well, I guess we found a lot about the Liberator today, thanks to Connie, who loves sex.  How's Merle in Reno?  Okay.  I don't know him either.  Ah.  I thought she would have known him. 
[02:12:00]  All right, Connie.  Well, you enjoy your banging.  Okay.  And I guess that's it, right?  We're done with Connie?  You were great, Connie.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome, and I'll have a great day.  All right.  You too.  There she goes.  Connie?  Connie?  Yes?  Yes?  I think she hung up.  I wanted to ask her something, too. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Connie?  You had her.  She was unflappable.  She was great.  Wow.  I'm sure she's heard it all, though, right?  Well, when you're selling the Liberator, I'm sure she has heard it all.  Probably not like that, though.  I thought I'd get her with that second.  Nothing.  Nothing.  She just didn't care.  Well, you can do whatever you like, the Liberator.  Liberate your wallet of money for nothing.  For no reason. 
[02:13:00]  Just use your couch cushions.  Don't need that.  What is that?  Well, just wait until your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Dave from Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I was just wondering if the Liberator can free little Connor from the deep.  Sir, what does that mean?  I know.  It doesn't make any sense, sir.  I understood.  Look, you should have said, will it liberate Connor from the deep? 
[02:13:30]  Icy roads today, boys and girls.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I called in the Jersey 101.5.  Yeah.  And they were asking what the hot Christmas gift was this year.  You know, what you need to find in stores.  And I called up before we talked about the Nintendo DS.  And I called up.  And sure enough, the XM MiFi was the number one Christmas gift this year for the excellent  coverage of 1A on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, thank you.  Oh, thanks for the mention, bro.  Very nice.  Yeah, absolutely.  And they cut me in.  Shut up.  Juliana.  Yeah, hey.  What's up?  You're calling from Iowa?  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on?  Well, you guys were talking about that little thing that they sell at the stores and everything,  a little vibrator with a woman smiling on the front.  She's got it on the back of her neck.  Yeah, it's a massager.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a clock of shit.  Well, did you buy it for your neck or for your pussy?  Let's get right down to business. 
[02:14:30]  You did, right?  Yes, I did.  And?  You know, but it doesn't work that great.  No.  No?  Why not?  You're better off going to a triple X store and getting like what they call the little  egg.  Oh, the egg with the little cord that comes out of it?  Yeah.  And you put it in there and...  The vibrating egg?  Yeah.  It vibrates right on your very sensitive area?  Yes.  Are you in the car right now?  I'm in my truck.  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  Do you have any of these apparatuses with you?  Uh, I have the one vibrator from the store and everything. 
[02:15:00]  I have to get me a new egg.  I broke my last one.  How'd you break it?  Bumpy road?  No, I just used it too much.  Wow.  You are a horny one.  Spent a lot of time on the road, huh?  Uh, yeah.  I'm out here at least 11 months out of the year.  All right.  Are you married?  Yes.  Wow.  A lot of women truckers.  More than I ever imagined.  And they're all married.  Are you a pretty gal?  I'm six foot one, brown hair, green eyes, about 168 pounds. 
[02:15:30]  You are a biggin'.  Wow.  I like that.  No, I mean, you're tall.  Yeah.  Gee.  I like it.  And are you masturbating as you're driving your truck?  No, I have given him blowjobs when he drives the truck.  Very good.  A little road head.  Yeah.  Nice.  A little road head for the hubby.  Yeah.  That's nice.  If you're 6'1", you can just lean over and suck it while you're driving.  It's slammed in the head with a gearshift knob. 
[02:16:00]  No, no, no.  That would be too dangerous.  I was actually hoping you were going to use the vibrator on the show today.  Well, no, because it doesn't work that well, you know?  Yeah, all right.  It's got better action when you have company.  All right.  Well, thank you, Juliana.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  You guys have a good day.  You too.  Bye.  I knew the girls would, you know.  That's not big.  6'1", 168.  All right, this is it.  I'm on.  Yo, Dee.  Hello.  Dee, you're on.  Hi.  How's everybody? 
[02:16:30]  Hi.  Dee from Alabama.  What's up?  Hi, sweet cheeks.  Hello, Petunia.  I'm doing great.  How are you guys?  Pretty good.  What do you got today?  I got the ramp wedge combo liberator adventure, bedroom adventure gear.  Bedroom adventure gear, huh?  Yes.  You have it?  Yes.  My boyfriend had it sent to me.  He mail-ordered it when he was over in Iraq last year.  Waiting for you to get home.  And then I had to wait for him, yeah, to use it.  I wouldn't.  If I was over in Iraq and your chick is at home, I wouldn't get her anything that would 
[02:17:00]  have her thinking about sex.  No, he sent me a box full of toys and everything.  Oh, what a nice guy.  He was a little paranoid, man.  Here, use these.  That's called paranoia.  Use these until I get back.  Yeah.  Well, the adventure gear, I have to tell you, I know that you're thinking it's not worth  it, but it's great.  What is the adventure gear?  Did I miss something?  Well, you'll get the package in the mail if you've ordered it.  All right.  It's the ramp wedge combo is what we have. 
[02:17:30]  Am I breaking up?  Yeah.  Is that your phone?  Yeah.  I'm in a car on a phone and there's like power lines everywhere.  I'm sorry.  Where the hell are you?  Yeah, power lines don't cause cancer.  Jesus.  I'm in Alabama.  Oh, that figures.  I think the whole state gives off that kind of radiation.  All right.  All right.  So you like the liberator, I guess, is what it comes down to.  We're just trying to figure out what the adventure gear is.  Is that like add-ons to the cushion?  That's just what we call it. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, I don't know if it's like the liberator adventure gear.  I don't know.  Oh, they just call the whole setup adventure gear.  Okay.  Because it's an adventure.  And that was good.  So what?  Did you use it right when he got back?  Yeah, as soon as.  As soon as he got back, he like took off his camos and jumped on you?  Yep.  It was like that.  Yeah.  And then like the blue cover, it's like velvet.  Yeah.  And it's washable.  It's really good stuff.  Did you have to hose it down when you were done?  No.  I just throw it in the wash.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  Made a mess out of it, didn't you?  Well, thanks, Dee.  Thank you.  She likes her liberator, Anthony.  Well, Ben's getting emailed.  Oh, show stuff, I hope.  Freddie at CagedHor.com.  How big is your big duty, Ben?  How big is your big duties?  How big is your retarded cock?  Timothy, subject, big cock.  Sorry, Ben, just had to do it.  Kurt, subject, big cock.  And then he just writes pictures, question mark.  And then there's Chief, who just writes big cock about a hundred times. 
[02:19:00]  And then, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, very excitedly.  Noah writes, I have a rabied squirrel in my backyard.  Could you beat it to death with your huge cock?  Shit dick.  Did he spell it right?  Rabied or rabid?  I don't know.  R-A-B-I-D. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I messed up.  All right.  Sorry.  Carl, guess what I heard is the subject.  I heard that you have a huge, delicious hog.  And this guy's using his Nextel two-way message.  Ben, you guys rock.  Happy holidays to all at ONA.  P.S., good luck with the Liberator.  That's within the first five minutes.  The fact that people are writing to ben.sparks at xmradio.com, this type of filth.  This is not what these email addresses are for.  This is only for business. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, we're trying to get some work done, guys.  Yeah.  You've really got to stop.  It's not nice.  You don't want to send them emails addressed to old gravy legs.  Stuff like that is ridiculous, stupid, and a waste of time.  There you go.  All right, Ben, I think we took care of it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sure, yeah.  Office accounts.  Oh, yeah, geez.  Our listeners respect that.  They won't do that.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  A few bad apples there.  Comparing Ben's cock to Connor Peterson.  I mean, why would you do that in an email?  Who's she for?  She's interviewing you guys. 
[02:20:30]  That girl's interviewing us?  Remember she reminds me of the time that that Playboy chick came that you didn't think  was really a reporter years ago?  Yeah.  Holy cow.  Holy mackerel.  That dish is interviewing us for what today?  A dish.  What is this?  The 40s?  Wow, she's a tall drink of water.  Yes.  All right.  Look at Jim just like, hey.  Gawking.  Yeah.  What is it for?  The magazine or the newspaper's called The Improper.  I have to look it up again.  The Improper.  Is that from Long Island, I think?  Yeah.  This was, you know, you guys do so many interviews, so this one was set up a while ago. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  So, but God damn.  All right.  Why don't we take a little break?  Play another South Park Christmas song.  It is the Christmas time.  This is the most offensive song you're going to hear this holiday season, I do believe,  Anthony.  Wow.  Which one is this?  It's a song.  All right.  And it's good.  And here it is.  Howdy, how.  Virgin Mary was sleeping when Angel Gabriel appeared. 
[02:21:30]  He said, you are to be the virgin mother, but Mary thought that was weird.  Mary said, I'm not a virgin.  I blew a guy last year.  But then Gabriel said to Mary, my child, have no fear.  You can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary, you can suck all the dick you want and still not be considered flawed.  Although you went to town and sucks on semen down, you're still a virgin in the eyes of God. 
[02:22:00]  There was no room at the inn when Mary and Joseph did arrive.  But they were so very tired, you see, and Mary had to offer a bribe.  Since she had no money, how would she pay for a place to sleep?  Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her not to wait. 
[02:22:30]  Because you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin, Mary.  You can suck all the dick you want and still be the mother of Christ.  If there's no room at the inn, then it's not considered a sin to suck some dick to get a room for the night.  Then three wise men did appear, bearing gifts of myrrh and such.  They said that they had followed a star and missed a woman's touch. 
[02:23:00]  Mary thought she might pleasure them, but could not take them to bed.  But again, Gabriel appeared to her, and this is what he said.  You can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin, Mary.  You can suck all the dick you want, everyone that hangs in the nation.  Felicio ain't no sin, gonna blow those three wise men. 
[02:23:30]  And you'll still be a virgin cause there was no penetration.  So you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin, Mary.  The donkey and the ox and the lambs and even the little drummer boy.  People will remember your name quick.  They'll say, damn, that bitch could suck a good dick.  Cause sucking dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Cause sucking dick brings peace on earth and joy. 
[02:24:00]  Mary, Mary, suck that dick.  Mon âne est de façon insensée fucable.  My ass is insanely fuckable.  M'auriez-vous pincez ma torte frémission d'amour?  Would you like to pinch my quivering love pie?  Mmm, mais cent cinquante-deux mille impôts de watts. 
[02:24:30]  My breasts are like two thousand watt light bulbs.  Aimeriez-vous jouer l'heure dans Tokyo?  Would you like to play Tune in Tokyo?  Oh, seulement Hopi and Anthony pouvant satisfaire.  Mon besoin pour la géante, palpitante, la viande d'hommes américaines.  Only Hopi and Anthony can satisfy my need for giant, pulsating American man meat.

[02:29:00]  Ian Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Merry Christmas.  I'm holding back on the smoothie today.  You're not doing the smoothie today?  The goodness of the smoothie, and believe me, it is goodness. 
[02:29:30]  How do I get this goodness in me?  I don't think you should be doing smoothies at 8.30 in the morning.  Why?  That's the problem.  Why?  I think if you, I don't know, wait until later on in the afternoon, I think your body can handle it better.  No, I don't think it's.  I think whatever time I had the smoothie, it would just be bad.  See, the goodness of the smoothie is offset by the badness of about 3.30, 4 o'clock, when  it just starts percolating inside your lower abdomen. 
[02:30:00]  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  You start getting those sounds like...  Like a squeaky door opening.  And the pains...  Oh, oh.  And it does.  It goes down, like, from your lower abdomen, down past your taint, to the back of your thighs.  And it starts throbbing. 
[02:30:30]  And then you also have Ethiopian belly.  Oh.  Because all the air that's just trapped in there.  Little flies flying around your face.  Pot belly.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Oh, it's awful.  Nice thick pile above the water.  That's part of the goodness for me, I think.  That nice dump out.  It just hurts.  Makes your stomach hurt. 
[02:31:00]  Cleans you out nice.  You guys are ordering smoothies, and I might have a nice bowl of this high-protein crunch cereal.  Opie brought in, like, real cereal today.  Well, because I don't want you to think this is all I eat.  I just, like...  I don't like the sugary cereals, that's all.  Opie makes cereal.  It's like medicine.  It's not cereal.  Like, you get cereal in a cereal box, and it's got, like, a happy face on it, or it's  got, like, colorful graphics and stuff.  Yours is like prescription cereal.  It's a good source of fiber, and it's low-fat. 
[02:31:30]  That box says nothing about tasting good or enjoying your time eating it.  It's wheat with crushed aspirin sprinkled on it.  Yeah, it might have.  Look, there's nothing on here that says anything about how good it tastes, how fun it is to  eat, and how much you'll enjoy it.  It's like medicine.  There's no goodness involved in that, huh?  There's no goodness.  There's a picture of a person eating on the front with his face in a feed bag.  It said one of the selling points is good source of fiber, and that's it. 
[02:32:00]  Like, it's no taste great.  Know what the other selling point should be right under that?  Less toilet paper.  Less toilet paper?  Less toilet paper.  Dude, I had a two-and-a-half-footer today.  Not even a hint on the paper.  Nothing, huh?  Absolutely nothing.  Oh, here's one thing about the taste.  Yeah.  Naturally sweetened with cane juice.  Oh, who's cane? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, pour me out a bowl.  I want a heaping bowl of back to nature.  High-protein crunch.  Right to the tippy top.  Right to the tippy.  The box is almost empty.  It still weighs a pound.  There are crumbs at the bottom of this.  Serving suggestion.  It should be a picture of a garbage pail.  That is awful.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  It looks like twigs, though.  Look at this crap.  They look like big, thick, fungus toenails.  I don't know.  So you brought in some...  It looks like discolored toenails.  You're right.  What did you bring in?  Honey?  No, that's...  Honey bunches of O's?  No, this is good.  Look.  There's a B on the box.  There you go.  That's a fun cereal.  Look at the side.  There's smiling, happy face things on there.  Yeah, this one's all right. 
[02:33:30]  So why don't you eat that?  I ate that this morning.  You had both?  No, no.  I have to stay away from this stuff.  You're not eating the prescription cereal anymore?  This is what clogged me up.  Hence the two and a half footer, finally.  I only like cereals that spell kids, K-I-D-Z on them.  And the K's backwards.  Yeah.  Kids love it.  Kids love it.  When I was a kid, it was all about just the sweet cereals.  Corn flakes or Cheerios, blow them out your ass.  I wanted sugar pops.  I wanted Captain Crunch. 
[02:34:00]  I would eat Captain Crunch until I had stalactites hanging from the roof of my mouth.  It would just chew up your gums and the roof of your mouth.  And it was great.  Remember the honeycomb hideout?  Honeycomb.  Oh, the milk would get trapped in the little honeycombs.  Lucky Charms was an old standby.  That was good stuff.  But Lucky Charms quickly turned into Cheerios because you'd pick out the charms.  You'd sit there and just pick them out of the box. 
[02:34:30]  Get a whole bowl of Just Charms and pour milk on them.  I used to do that.  Really?  Oh, my brother and sister would get so pissed off.  But if they got the chance, they would do it first.  You'd pick all the charms out by hand, fill a bowl up with Just Charms, pour milk on it, and eat that.  Oh, it was great.  As a kid, you just wanted sugar.  There was the cereal that just turned your milk into chocolate milk.  It was Old Gravy Leg, it was called. 
[02:35:00]  Some kind of like Cocoa Puffs.  That was it.  Oh, okay.  Cocoa Puffs.  They turn your milk like...  Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.  I'm cuckoo.  Yeah.  I don't see no wacky commercial on the air for your gravel cereal, Opie.  Yeah, it's a wacky cartoon character, like, straining with no logs coming out.  Hey, no logs, how's it going today?  Having a tough time.  Try this.  Hey, dumpster bowels, how are you?  Wow, we're getting huge headlines today, Anthony. 
[02:35:30]  More headlines coming in.  More headlines.  More Twitter.  We made a huge move yesterday.  An absolutely huge move.  It all went down late Friday.  Under the cover of Darkness, Anthony, we snuck over to the Citadel headquarters here in New York City  and talked to our old pal Farid, who used to run the radio division at Infinity Broadcasting.  And we made a deal to replace Howard in Syracuse while he's on vacation.  Yeah, and we'll see where it goes. 
[02:36:00]  And everyone is talking about it.  It really is a big move for the radio program.  I do believe we're the first show, one of those high-profile shows, that have gotten back onto broadcast radio after screwing up.  After the Sex for Sam thing, they fired how many jocks went after we did.  Yeah.  After us, it was like, oh, you mean we can get rid of these guys?  Yeah.  It used to be you screwed up, you got a better gig.  That was just the way radio worked.  And then we screw up, we got booted, and then they just decided if you screw up on the air, we'll fire you. 
[02:36:30]  And they did.  They let a lot of people go for stupid, you know, saying something racist, saying something sexist, indecency on the air.  And we're kind of the first guys making our way back into broadcast radio.  The regular guys in Atlanta were trying to do some, like, FVFCC thing where they were going to have, like, hardcore sex.  What a screw-up that was.  Here's a brain surgeon at work.  Like, they decided they were going to play a sexually explicit interview with a porn star on the air. 
[02:37:00]  The twist, we're going to play it backwards.  So all you'd hear is,  But then we're going to play the whole thing backwards, not even just the dirty part.  Yeah.  And they figured that would be a funny little twist.  Well, as they're editing it, they did the interview off the air, obviously, and they're editing it. 
[02:37:30]  And what they were editing goes out live over the air, and she's just talking about shoving things into her twats.  It was really graphic.  Into her twats, like, she has more than one.  Yeah.  What an ass.  And they threw them off the air.  They gave them a week.  And we knew.  Me and Oprah are like, oh, these guys are so done.  Because they give them a week.  We're going to investigate this and see who's responsible.  And those responsible will have some type of punishment.  Me and Oprah are like, fired. 
[02:38:00]  One of our favorite expressions when Annette and I talk to each other about this stuff is,  They're so fired.  So fired.  Not even they're fired.  They're so fired.  They are more fired than fired.  Right.  Just completely and totally fired.  Totally so fired.  And they were.  We've been through the speech before.  We're doing an internal investigation on the dead mayor prank.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, we're just going to talk, find out what happened, and we'll get this done. 
[02:38:30]  As quick as possible, get you guys back on the air.  That's what this woman was saying to us in this conference room.  You know, we'll find out exactly what happened and get it done real quick.  We'll get you back on the air.  Yeah.  Right.  We were so.  So fired.  Fired.  For the first time.  We couldn't be more fired if we had already been fired.  Yeah.  We were just so fired.  So, making headlines, Anthony.  Just like we told everyone yesterday, good old Fareed threw us on in Syracuse on a commercial radio station. 
[02:39:00]  And I guess they're playing yesterday's show today.  They're trying to figure it out as we go.  We're trying to figure it out as we go.  We think there's something there.  We just don't know what yet.  Mm-hmm.  You know, maybe.  I don't know.  We'll have to just kind of experiment and figure it out.  So, more headlines coming in about our move.  XM's Opie and Anthony could be on your local radio dial.  They're available on a case-by-case basis, this article says, Anthony.  Inside Radio told you in Monday's headlines that they materialized on Citadel's WAQX Syracuse.  And XM confirms the once-banished duo could strike deals to put their XM-oriented morning show on the air in other radio markets. 
[02:39:30]  The show that's airing on 95X is literally the previous day's XM show.  Though it's up to the local licensee to sanitize the content to comport with FCC requirements.  XM satellite radio chief programmer Eric Logan, ELO, tells Inside Radio.  It doesn't say ELO.  It says ELO.  Tells Inside Radio they were contacted by Citadel about Syracuse.  ELO says that's the only deal for Opie and Anthony right now. 
[02:40:00]  But he says, and this is new, and I don't even, we don't even know this.  This direct from ELO?  But he says, my phone is ringing already today.  Opie!  I knew this would be the start.  Yes.  I knew that we just needed one guy to be brave enough to say, look, these guys are still good enough for commercial radio as well.  That's right.  Because radio stinks out there.  It's awful.  And the show is not going to change, so stop with the questions about that. 
[02:40:30]  It's just not.  It'll be up to...  We'll prove that today.  It'll be up to...  Yeah, exactly.  I've never heard more filthy material than on today's show, Jesus Christ.  And they're supposed to run this show tomorrow.  So, see, it's not going to change.  It's going to be up...  If someone out there wants to put us on a commercial radio station, they can figure out how to make it work.  That's great.  But we're moving on to the satellite radio thing.  We believe in this, and that's how it's going to be.  Radio.  But if they want to take some of the cleaner material and they think it's funny and worth airing in their little city, that's great. 
[02:41:00]  We'll accept that, right?  Cut out a word.  Put it backwards.  All right.  So, his phone is ringing already today.  Very interesting.  So, those folks who predicted Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia would have trouble working in terrestrial radio are wrong.  Heck, we might have been among those forecasters.  Of course you are, scumbag.  That means Syracusans got to hear Owen A rag Frankie Blue yet again for his unscheduled air shift after last Wednesday night's WNEW Christmas party. 
[02:41:30]  I think when we enter any new market, we ought to just rag Frankie Blue.  Why not?  Still got the tape.  We could do it a third time today.  We can't get enough of that tape.  He wants his morning show to fuck listeners.  I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.  Yet again for his unscheduled air shift.  It also means that Howard Stern is somewhere on vacation right now, spitting mad.  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  If we know Howard like we think we do, he's out of his mind and his vacation is completely ruined. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  He is not enjoying this.  Citadel's probably using Opie and Anthony in Syracuse only for Stern's vacation.  Using us like common hooers.  That's fine.  We don't care.  And yes, that's got to be driving Stern nuts, this one says.  There's nothing he can do about it.  But that's because he's enjoying his usual year-end holiday break and his show is in best-of mode.  Which is what prompted Citadel to make that call to XM last week.  Remember that ONA and Stern have a genuine feud going on.  Hughes and Cumia insist they were once ordered by Infinity, not to mention Stern, when they were on WNEW. 
[02:42:30]  That is a fact.  I know.  Do we have to bring in paperwork?  Yeah.  And we've always believed there was pressure on N.E.W. not to move their popular PM Drive team to mornings because it would compete with Howard.  That's a fact, too.  That's true, also.  They wanted to put us on in mornings at WNEW.  It was the only way to really anchor the station and build around that.  But they wouldn't let us or any popular morning radio show, anything that could have gotten ratings, in that morning drive slot. 
[02:43:00]  Because they were protecting Howard.  Yeah, if Howard were so great, what would have been the problem having another popular show on in morning drive?  No problem.  Right?  You're so great.  Shouldn't you be taking on all competitors?  Everyone rips you off.  You're so fantastic.  Great.  You're the originator.  What's the problem with having another show in morning drive up against you?  What's wrong? 
[02:43:30]  You phony.  You hypocrite.  I love that this just eats at him and pisses him off.  He's not making friends in the radio industry, believe me.  I mean, the doggy company loves that he's coming on board over there.  But in doing so, Howard's alienated himself from not only Citadel, but Infinity.  Everyone over at Infinity, all the brass, can't stand him.  Cannot stand him.  Can't stand what he's done.  He's not leaving gracefully. 
[02:44:00]  And what he's doing is putting himself in a perfect position for broadcast radio to undermine his program and chop off its legs.  Make it unenjoyable for anybody to listen to.  So sit there for another year as Viacom, because they hate you, really ravages your show.  And lose listeners so that by the time you go to Satellite, maybe you won't have as many.  Citadel hates you and Clear Channel hates you.  Mm-hmm.  Clear Channel.  Yeah, Citadel and Infinity. 
[02:44:30]  So look what we do.  We do the satellite radio and some commercial, too.  Hey, we're friendly to everybody.  You want to conduct a little business with the Opie and Anthony show?  We're open to that.  Old tree got fudders.  Old tree radio companies.  So the story's still developing.  Every day it's getting a little bigger.  A little bigger.  Which is kind of neat.  And everyone's on the inside now.  You'll see when it pops.  Right.  You'll go, oh, I heard about it.  That's right.  Quick little music interlude. 
[02:45:00]  It's only 30 seconds.  I think it's something that people will enjoy today, Anthony.  Not an interlude, but how about something we just throw in?  You want me to just throw this in?  So you can open up your seltzer?  Remember?  Remember when that was beer?  Yeah, I do remember.  Yes.  Okay.  I think because of the holiday season, I think people will enjoy this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a fave.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:45:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're just a tool.  You don't like that?  Ouch. 
[02:46:00]  Huh?  God, it would be funny if she was doing the same thing as you're just stabbing her in the chest.  Hey, look, she's doing it that way.  You get a laugh out of me.  This never gets old.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  That's the finale of the eggnog drinking contest that we did on Friday.  Let's say hi to Don in Georgia. 
[02:46:30]  What's up, Don?  Is that Don on the phone?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  What's up, Don?  This is Sam in Florida.  Anyways, you guys bitch worship almost as bad as Howard Stern.  Almost.  Nah, not really.  For what?  Honestly, we have our moments, but not really.  We're giving you quality entertainment every day.  Were we bitching?  Oh, yeah, earlier, whenever the new guy, Mike, or whatever, went out there for the live shot.  Oh, my God.  We had to...  Holy cow.  You don't understand.  Man, that's a huge missed opportunity. 
[02:47:00]  That's why we were bitching about that.  No.  Oh, anyways.  What do you do for a living, sir?  I'm a truck driver.  You're a truck driver.  What if somebody missed an opportunity to pick up a load that you could have made a lot of money on?  Wouldn't you be pissed?  Heads would roll.  Yeah, that's what we're...  We missed a banner opportunity, and we were just voicing our concern about that.  We have to market this show ourselves, okay? 
[02:47:30]  And one of the ways we're going to do that is this whole assault on the media that we started years ago, and we're bringing it back.  And we're looking for our listeners to get in front of some live TV shots with O&A signs or...  Guerrilla marketing.  Yeah, it's called guerrilla marketing.  You know, jump up and down and say stupid things, but make sure you get Opie and Anthony's name out or XM Satellite Radio's logo on TV.  And it's just another way to spread the O&A virus, okay?  So when we find out that there's a news crew, literally a block where we're broadcasting from, and they're going live, and we send one of our guys down there with a sign. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, the sign.  It's ready to go.  I mean, it was a no-brainer.  And then he messes up.  What are we supposed to do?  Oh, look at Yankee Stadium live shot.  You're right, shoot his ass.  He fucked up.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, you guys, it's happening more than you know.  The what?  Gay sex?  The truckers.  No, the truckers.  What about the truckers?  I mean, it's O&A everywhere you look.  Wow written in the dirt.  Oh, I know.  We definitely appreciate it.  No, dude, we love the truckers.  We didn't really get them at first, but I think we're figuring each other out, you know? 
[02:48:30]  They're figuring us out, and we're figuring what they're about.  The whole subculture.  We're all here.  See you later.  Bye.  All right.  Bye, baby girl.  And I think we have more new listeners that are truckers listening to this program than our old listeners from the commercial radio days.  More new truckers.  Wait, more old.  Does it kind of make sense?  Carry the truckers.  Divide by what?  I'm just saying, we've got a lot of new listeners that are truckers that weren't listening to the old program.  Right.  And there was a lot of old listeners that, wait. 
[02:49:00]  Were new after the...  And then, yeah.  But they didn't open up their gifts yet because it's still under the tree, but then they will be listening after Christmas and turning on their radios between Christmas and New Year's so they could enjoy the fine programming that is the Opie and Anthony show.  That's true.  What?  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  Anthony, yesterday we were talking about...  God, we're all over the ball field today, but that's all right.  We weren't even supposed to be here this week. 
[02:49:30]  I wasn't supposed to be here today.  Remember we were talking about the, we're going to turn this thing around.  One of my favorites.  I love this guy.  Well, our listeners, I mean, you guys are really helping us get the show back together.  A lot of missing puzzle pieces that the listeners are filling in.  Yeah.  Well, a lot of people turn on their radios overnight.  They have no idea where this show started two and a half months ago.  You think it stinks now?  It was absolutely awful.  We had nothing.  We had nothing.  Is that a promo?  You think it stinks now?  You should have seen it a month ago. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  We had nothing.  And every day we're getting another little piece.  Yeah, we didn't have anything.  Nothing.  We weren't allowed to bring anything with us when we got kicked out of the other place  that's only a few doors down.  Yeah.  So we were talking about the Jimmy Stewart thing.  We forgot all about it.  It's a Jimmy Stewart prank call, basically, to what, tech support or something?  I think the woman is calling and she thinks it's some kind of support line for some product.  And it wasn't.  And it's this guy that does this bad Jimmy Stewart impression. 
[02:50:30]  And he yanks her chain and she really gets pissed.  Was it a computer or something?  I don't remember what kind of tech support it was.  I don't either.  She was trying to get on a website, I think.  Yeah.  And she was having a tough time, so she called tech support.  And the guy is so frustrating that she just loses her mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Tech support.  Oh, yes.  Hi.  I'm trying to get on the Barnes and Noble line and I can't.  Oh, what's your problem? 
[02:51:00]  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through  and to call tech support.  Oh.  We're going to be more specific, but we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Great.  Okay.  So, did you enter your area code?  It seems to be entered already.  Right.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  You're 2-1-2, right?  Right.  That's great.  Let's just stick with me.  We'll turn this thing around.  Okay.  Great.  Okay.  Now re-enter your area code.  Oh, God.  Cancel with...  Okay.  Um, all right.  Now, the problem is that I need probably to call you on my cell phone because this isn't...  I have one line here.  All right.  Well, do you use your toolbar? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  I guess.  What's the toolbar?  Well, you've got to use your toolbar.  That's where your icons are that we're going to have to use to fix this problem.  Well, before you get through this later, you just got to keep your chin up.  Okay.  I hope so.  All right.  Turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  So, how do...  What...  The toolbar is the thing at the bottom?  No.  Well, it could be at the top of the part. 
[02:52:30]  You have a Mac or all the PCs?  I have a PC.  I have a Dell.  Oh, that's good.  It's fine instrument.  I also have...  I have the disc.  You know, I have the...  The...  Uh...  Born to Noble disc.  Oh, you got the disc?  Yeah, and it's...  Oh, the disc.  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  It's not working.  Oh.  The sun's on the horizon.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay. 
[02:53:00]  Put your disc in.  It's in?  Okay.  I'll boot off your computer.  You have to restart your computer.  Okay.  So, you want me to just shut everything down here?  Oh, you have to push on the ring side.  You don't have to stick with me here.  Let's keep focused.  Where is that?  Keep focused here.  You have to write it down with a pencil.  Okay.  Where is it, though?  Uh...  You don't have to turn off your computer, right?  Yeah.  You don't do it with a button, do you?  Yeah, I do.  What do you mean?  Uh, well, there's a... 
[02:53:30]  Um, okay.  I've got to go to shut down.  Uh, that's where your toolbar is.  You've got to grab all of it.  Okay.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  Well, I'll grab all of your toolbar.  I did.  You want me to...  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart?  Okay.  You've got to stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Now, you've got to turn it off, but then you're going to see the restart.  Now, you check restart.  Now, there they...  Okay, you want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying. 
[02:54:00]  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Okay.  You've got to stay focused here.  You lose your cool.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  You guys, take a breath there.  Keep your chin up.  Okay.  You're making me confused, though.  So, I'm...  No.  Well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath.  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  So, I just...  I press restart.  Yeah, well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here. 
[02:54:30]  I'm not.  No, I'm not yelling at you.  I'm not yelling at you.  It's just...  You know, it's frustrating.  Yeah.  You know how...  Oh, is it rebooting?  Yeah.  What's happening?  www.dell.com came up on my screen.  So, it'll be a minute or two now.  Okay.  Making all noises and what have you.  But I left the CD in there.  The Barnes & Noble CD.  Is that good or should I take it out?  That was CD-ROM, right? 
[02:55:00]  Yep.  Oh, I'm sick of music CD in there.  No, it's not music CD.  Oh, I'm not joking.  No, I...  It'll break your computer.  Oh, no.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass.  Really?  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me?  I haven't heard that throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Oh, yeah, you're going to try it.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  I don't spend much time around horses, 
[02:55:30]  so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend time around horses,  you don't make a jackass out of your own self.  Oh, well, that could be.  Where are you located now?  Uh, Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Okay, well.  Well, what?  Well, that's...  Where are you from?  New York City.  Oh, that's right.  The 2-1-2.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses around.  Yeah, but you've got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure. 
[02:56:00]  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Oh, well, I say you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step out in there, you get out there,  you work, you shove up that snow and turn things around.  Oh, you're right.  Okay, now, it came up here.  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect.

I had to do wrong.  Please hold.  I had to do that to get that.  There we go.  Now we got Ryan.  What's up, Ryan?  You guys can hear me? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Cupcake.  Hi, little pumpkin.  Hey, sweetie.  You guys realize there was more people at Lee Harvey Oswald's funeral than there was  at this fucking dumb party?  Punching out, Diamond Duck.  Punch out.  Oh, that's funny.  What is this guy talking about?  Hug Farmer?  Yeah, come on, man.  What's up, Hug Farmer?  Hey, dude.  Hi.  I paid $2 to listen to that shit with that Frenchy motherfucker.

Just clicked off on you.  Unkeyed his mic, and that was it.  Let's get an update from Syracuse.  We're on a commercial station in Syracuse, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  It's a big deal in the radio community, and we have Ryan.  What's up, Ryan?  It's Ronnie, actually.  Oh, wow.  Why were they just showing us on TV?  What was that about?  They're doing Christmas gifts. 
[03:28:30]  It looks like they're doing MiFi.  It was just the two of you.  That's from the MiFi press conference.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  We were distracted.  All of a sudden, we're talking, and we see our faces on TV.  Oh.  That was a little weird.  All right.  What's your name, buddy?  Oh.  Hello.  Hi.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  They're playing right now the Shatner from yesterday.  Oh, the Shatner interview?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  They're playing that.  Oh, very cool.  Bill Shatner called me stupid.  All right.  So, they're playing that.  So, they're pretty much playing some of the stuff from yesterday's show in Syracuse.  Cool.  Yeah.  They're going to do a brand new show on XF Satellite Radio today.  They're playing music.  It's kind of weird, though, because they're playing music, and then they'll play some of  the show, and then some music.  Yeah.  Does it seem...  Did you hear yesterday's?  No, I did not.  I'm just wondering if it's a little more of us than there was yesterday, because that would  be more gooder.  A little more every day.  It seems like there's quite a bit, though.  There we go.  Yeah, I'm hearing there's much longer breaks today in Syracuse.  That's more gooder.  And it's new stuff. 
[03:29:30]  It's not stuff from 1997, I believe.  They're just trying to figure it out what works.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And the only other thing that's really weird is that the Howard people have got to be  freaking out.  You know, they tune in to listen to Howard.  Of course.  And you guys are, what is this?  We love that.  Don't you understand that we're dicks?  We love that.  We love getting under people's skin.  Yes.  And you guys are definitely doing it.  All right.  Thank you.  Goodbye now.  There's the Syracuse update.  So I guess they're like a day behind.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:30:00]  Wolfgang.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  San Antonio.  What up?  I was just going to say that I think that my grandfather had more fun retreating from  the Germans in Stalingrad than at Cockroach Frenchy's party.  Ooh.  Half these people don't even know Frenchy and they just get it already.  Maybe next time he can have his party over in Germany at the museum at Auschwitz.  Oh, jeez.  You guys have a good day.  Goodbye.  Shh. 
[03:30:30]  Thank you, Wolfgang.  Thank you, Wolfgang.  Shh.  Quiet.  I didn't hear you.  Shh.  Well, the tip, it's a glistening.  Hey there, hands.  Are you listening?  I'll pretend you're a chick whacking my dick while I'm jerking off with my left hands.  Oh, my balls, I will tickle as I yank on my pickle. 
[03:31:00]  It felt so good stroking my wood while I was jerking off with my left hands.  Here's another trick that I would use, man, to make it special when I'd want to come.  I'd fall asleep while lying on my arm and whack it when my hand was nice and numb.  Tricks I'd learned in my teen years Got me through all those lean years 
[03:31:30]  My hand was my whore, but I'd pretend it was more While I was jerking off with my left hand  While I was jerking off with my left hand  While I was jerking off with my left hand  While I was jerking off with my left hand 
[03:32:00]  Good old Brother Joe, huh, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  I like that one a lot, actually.  That's a good one.  Tommy, before we go to break, I forgot what...  Holiday spirit.  A lot of people are requesting this sexual harassment audio thing.  Is the video up on foundrymusic.com?  It is.  I haven't seen that one yet.  All right.  Yeah, we have the video of what you're about to hear on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com.  But what is this again, Anthony?  Oh, it's a little instructional video, audio from the instructional video on sexual harassment in the workplace. 
[03:32:30]  You know how they play these things for you?  You have to, when you start a new job especially, they pull you in and show you these videos  and give you the booklets on sexual harassment.  This is just audio from one of those films that they show people.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV and it makes the headlines in newspapers.  As an employee, what do you need to know about it? 
[03:33:00]  First, sexual harassment is against the law.  And it's against your company's policy.  So, what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here.  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy. 
[03:33:30]  Ow!  Bill!  Sorry.  You looked really tense.  You know, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal.  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.  Yes, I do.  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime. 
[03:34:00]  Maybe a little oil.  Two fat cocks.  Together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters.  Cartoons or drawings.  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.  Man.  I could go for a power fuck right now. 
[03:34:30]  Change is slow.  And what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.  Treat your coworkers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy.  It's your company's policy. 
[03:35:00]  And it's the law.  It's your company's policy.  And it's the law.  It's your company's policy.  It's your company's policy.  It's your company's policy.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Gut busting, ab crunching, boy how bad can it get?  Have you seen a man eat his own head?  Yes.  Now you'll get used to it.  Anthony spent three hundred dollars on fags.  Ass clowns.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  It should be illegal.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You guys suck!  All that talk is crazy!

[03:39:00]  Oh, baby, baby, baby. Holy shit.  It's an Obi and Anthony Wow Sticker Stop.  This Wednesday between 6 and 7 a.m. during your morning commute,  get to Grand Central Station in New York City and pick up your Wow Stickers.  Whoa, those aren't real. Yes, they are.  The entrance on 42nd Street near the subway and taxi stand.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop, brought to you by your pals at the Obi and Anthony Show.  XM202, the Obi and Anthony Show. 
[03:39:30]  You're checking out the Obi and Anthony program, the O&A virus, right, Ant?  Right. 
[03:40:00]  Getting more gooder every day.  Thank you.  Thank you for helping us, I don't know, spread the show to others.  Bless you, Jimmy.  Bless you.  Thanks, Hope.  Thanks.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  Merry Christmas.  So not Christmassy.  Even in here.  You'd think we could have decked the studio in something.  You know, why don't we get in the spirit of things and put lights around the big Opie and  Anthony sign and put maybe a little Christmas tree in the corner. 
[03:40:30]  And a little mistletoe for Jimmy.  Yes.  Over Ben's hog.  That could be the Rockefeller Center tree.  Maybe by tomorrow when we come in, there'll be a little bit of decorating done.  I think maybe a little garland around the windows.  There's nothing that even shows that it's Christmas time around here.  That's why we're such cranky bastards.  It's weird.  It's just like passing us by this year, right?  Yeah.  Maybe by tomorrow we can have a little bit of a room.  Usually we're off this time of year. 
[03:41:00]  Uh-huh.  We decided it was a smart thing to just keep broadcasting live.  You think they've decorated down in D.C. at the main complex?  I'm sure it's all decked out.  I think corporate, they had meetings about it.  Yeah.  Who was going to hang the ornaments and when they were going to be hung.  And we'll get back to you next week.  I'm thinking sometime in February they'll have them up.  By Easter.  We're going to blue sky boughs of holly.  Yeah.  We're going to tee up the top of the tree and I don't know, we'll get back to you on 
[03:41:30]  that one.  I've got to call some other people that are in charge though.  We have two buckets.  One has Christmas balls in it and one has pine cones.  We don't know which one of the trees.  Two buckets.  Yes.  The reporter's laughing.  She's fantastic.  She's digging the conversation.  She has a thing for me.  Let's go to Krista.  Have we green-lighted the red lights?  Or are we going to red-light the green lights?  Which ones? 
[03:42:00]  Krista on Long Island.  Krista.  Krista.  Krista the blind chick checking in.  You're blind.  Yes.  We remember that.  Yes.  Okay.  Well.  Wait, wait.  What's the story about Krista?  I don't remember Krista.  I remember her being blind.  Where are you right now?  Long Island.  How do you know?  You think you're on Long Island.  Okay.  I wanted to know if Norton had any more.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I want to know how we know you.  Yeah.  We need a little.  Oh, because I was the.  I called in on the air, and I was the, basically, Norton was singing, you sightless twat. 
[03:42:30]  Oh.  Oh, is that you?  Your dog just shit on my rug.  Yeah, that was it.  You're the inspiration for that?  Yeah, I'm the inspiration for that.  Oh, my God.  We're talking to someone famous.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Oh, my little hands just can't reach my long, misshapen, ruining-the-family-photographs face.  And you were blind since when?  Since birth.  Since birth, so it doesn't matter to you, right?  Well, I mean, it would be cool to see and everything, but. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, you don't really care, though.  Yeah, but what is seeing?  Do you even know what it means?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, technically, I don't know what.  Well, I want to know what Norton looks like, why he can't get a date, like a real girl to  bang him.  Well, I mean, it wouldn't matter what I look like to you because you never had sight, so  just for you, everything is touch.  Well, that's true.  Picture a marshmallow with an appendix scar in the middle, a mediocre head with no chin  on top, and picture two fine bowling pin calves with the penis of a four-year-old boy 
[03:43:30]  in between them, and then you've gotten me.  That's what I would feel like if I was laying nude on a cushion and you were putting your  hands all over me.  What about your boobies?  Yes, I have fine B-cups that you could mush and massage.  I'd love to see her come up and touch her face like that scene in Mask.  Oh, God.  Then you watch her just go, watch me go pull pins out as she says she won't go to Europe  with me.  A little tear as you pull the pins out of that map.  That's right.  Ben Sparks decides not to go. 
[03:44:00]  Can't go.  He's having cock reduction surgery.  Oh, God.  Are you married or?  No.  You got a boyfriend?  I have a boyfriend, yes.  You have a boyfriend.  Can he see?  No.  No?  Well, he has some vision.  Wow, that's going to just be a mess.  How do you guys meet?  You just walk down the block and yell, Marco.  Yeah, how did two hook up at a blind thing? 
[03:44:30]  We actually met at a summer camp.  That's a blind summer camp?  Uh-huh.  That's great.  A summer camp for the visually impaired.  And that was like ages ago.  So we've been friends for years and years.  How old are you?  I am 20.  Oh, wow.  She's only 20 years old.  Are you hot?  I don't know.  I have no clue.  Well, what...  People say I'm hot.  Well, how tall are you?  I'm 5'4".  How much do you weigh?  120.  They're being polite. 
[03:45:00]  What?  How do you know you weigh 120?  Because I go on the scale.  How else would I know?  Hold on, hold on.  You weigh 120 pounds.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be a talking scale, right?  Can you hear my screen reader say all kinds of dirty stuff?  Oh, yeah.  A screen reader?  Go ahead.  Yeah, okay.  Let's hear what fun they've invented for the blind.  I have to shut off XM Radio Online.  I have to open up Microsoft Word.  If I lived with her, I would put a brick on the scale. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, that would be really funny.  Oh, that's awful.  You weigh 192 pounds.  What?  Stop eating.  Can you guys hear the screen reader at all?  Try it again.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Come on.  Oh, I have to, like, type some stuff and then slow it down for you guys.  It sounded like it was trying to eat your pussy.  Jesus.  Well, yeah, that's because I have it so fast. 
[03:46:00]  Let's see.  I'm trying to type something interesting.  What do you want the screen reader to say, you guys?  Um, well, you should do some Ben stuff.  All right.  Hey, Ben, is that a Haitian family in your pants or are you happy to see me?  Let's see.  How do I get to say Haitian?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Asian.  No, that's not going to work.  Can you spell AIDS?  No, I'm trying to figure out.  What did you say is a Haitian family in Japan? 
[03:46:30]  In your pants.  In your pants.  In Japan.  What are you, deaf too?  Yeah, take it easy, deafy.  I can't believe blindy and deafy.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  Let's listen to this here.  What?  That talks too fast.  Oh, okay.  I got to slow it down.  Yeah.  For you guys, you're not used to riding the fast lane here.  Wow, you understand it that fast.  Okay, how's this?  Real slow. 
[03:47:00]  Lynn, hey Ben, is that Haitian family in your pants?  I kind of heard that.  How about, hey Ben, nice big cock.  Big.  You heard me.  Fine.  KC.  Oops.  Okay, here we go.  Hey Ben, nice big cock.  All right.  We will never grow up.  I love that they invent this technology to help visually impaired people, and it's being 
[03:47:30]  used for a dick joke.  How about this?  Yeah, well, you can go on pdaudio.net.  There's like an awesome, it's an awesome website about where this blind guy, he did deck talk,  which is a synthesizer, and he did all kinds of like bits.  Really?  With the synthesizer.  We'll check it out.  Can you say this?  Can you say this?  Hey Gravy Leg, the Patriots suck.  Look how fast he types. 
[03:48:00]  Hey Gravy Leg, the Patriots suck all.  Hey Gravy Leg.  Can you slow it down slightly or no?  Yeah, it's already really, really slow, but I'll slow it down.  Slow for you.  And then maybe just a little more volume.  A little more volume.  A little more volume.  I'm very lucky.  I'm actually, my mom's not home here, so I can do this.  All right.  How do you know? 
[03:48:30]  I can slow it down the left foot.  You hear that one?  Yeah.  How about one more?  How about, let's see.  Hey Ben, your big duties are blocking the highway.  We've got to make promos with this thing. 
[03:49:00]  How fast can it talk?  Like, you're slowing it down for us.  How fast can it talk?  You want it to talk really fast?  The way you listen to it under normal circumstances.  All right, hold on a second.  Well, I've got to get it to slow down somehow.  I mean, to speed up again.  This is a hard goal.  Manic.  Oh, I can't get it to speed up because I don't have enough, like, you know, text.  It was hard to, let's see. 
[03:49:30]  Wow.  Is that a cute hearing?  You don't understand that, do you?  Yes.  I do understand it.  What did it say?  It actually said I'm speeding it up to normal volume.  I wrote volume instead of, like, rate.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Just because I'm a twat.  Jesus.  All right.  So, what do you want to ask Jimmy today?  Well, I wanted to ask him what he looked like.  Well, we got that.  You got that.  And I wanted to know if he's had any more run-ins with the hoes of the evening. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, I've had a few.  I mean, I've been better than normal.  Like, a lot of times I can hold off and just, you know, throw in a porn.  But, yeah, I've had a few.  You mean, like, Max Core or something?  Max Hardcore, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You like porno?  Well, obviously, I can't like porno.  Well, you can listen to it, I guess.  There's not really much to listen to, is there?  Are you completely, like, can't see anything blind?  Basically, yeah.  Answer, this is the way we should ask it.  I mean, like, maybe you can see a little light, but that's about it. 
[03:50:30]  Would a lineup do you any good?  A what?  A lineup in a police precinct.  A lineup?  Oh, you mean, like, to identify somebody?  Yeah.  Yes.  Ah.  Blind enough.  There you go, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, I could recognize voices.  If the guy's tough enough, I'd obviously, uh...  Have it all figured out.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Maybe he just had that machine.  Take off your pants.  He won't get hurt.  All right, hold on.  I'll get to say that. 
[03:51:00]  I love how she types.  It's amazing.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Take off your pants.  You won't get hurt.  I'll read your mother's back.  Take off your pants.  Wow.  Your machine has Parkinson's.  Okay, I'll pull it down so you can understand it.  Take off your pants.  You won't get hurt.  I'll read your mother's back like a cat hole.  Hey, can you make it go...  Hold on a sec. 
[03:51:30]  Little humiliated fingers.  All right.  Let's see.  That's about all it's going to do.  All right.  Not too cool.  All right.  That's fantastic.  Well, Krista, you're a lot of fun, man.  Thanks.  A lot of fun.  You got to come in one time.  Come into the studio?  Yeah, yeah.  Just maybe if you can leave now, maybe we can see you like in early January sometime.  You know, I think, I just wish I had more than just XM Radio Online. 
[03:52:00]  You know, the accessibility department over at XM, you guys are horrible with the flash and the macromedia technology.  I mean, it's hard enough to get you guys on the computer with, you know, with all this technology.  I've heard something about XM working with NFB to try and make it more accessible for us visually impaired people.  But knowing XM, that's probably not going to be 2000 to like 2080 when I'm dead.  Oh.  Yeah, well, we'll see. 
[03:52:30]  We're working on it.  All right, Krista.  Thanks.  Thank you so much.  You were a lot of fun.  Thank you so much.  Bye, sweet kids.  Goodbye, angel face.  Punching out.  Should have called her angel eyes.  That would have been kind of funny and ironic.  Oh.  Keep up your good nature.  Thank you.  All right.  There she goes.  All right, very good.  Hey, look at that.  Ryan in Philly.  What's up, Ryan?  Uh, yeah, last night, man, I don't know if anybody's even talked about this.  It's like one o'clock.  I'm trying to dog off, you know, not off.  And all I hear in the back of my head is that O'Connor song. 
[03:53:00]  O'Connor.  That's all I hear in the back of my head.  Eyes shut, drifting off.  And you just hear that haunting noise.  It's creepy, right?  It's beyond creepy.  I mean, like 1 a.m., you try to fall asleep,  and all you hear is just that.  Nothing else, just the O'Connor.  Yeah, I don't even know where that is anymore.  I think we threw that one away.  It was so creepy.  I want to hear that.  It doesn't matter.  All right.  It's haunting.  Well, thank you.  Bye.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  I'll be wrong button. 
[03:53:30]  Thanks, Eric.  Uh.  Sorry.  Uh.  That's supposed to happen after.  Yeah.  What happened?  It's mislabeled.  It's okay.  Hey, Andy from London, England.  We love the fact that we have people listening all over the globe.  Yes.  Not just all over the country, but all over the globe.  But do you have to print the same stupid joke we've seen 800 times on the instant feedback?  You're taking up valuable room.  Which joke was that, Ant?  Uh. 
[03:54:00]  What's the opposite of Christopher Reeve?  Christopher Walken.  You know.  You know.  There were two.  In the comedy show that one night, there was two British guys.  Huge Opie and Anthony fans.  I don't know if I told you guys.  They're like, we're from England.  We listen online.  They love this.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's this guy or not.  Meh.  Meh.  All right.  Yeah, but he did it like 80 times.  You're taking up valuable room on our instant feedback.  For comments from, uh.  But he got your attention.  Yeah, he did, bastard.  It worked.  He got on the air.  Good comments will get attention anyway. 
[03:54:30]  It's just the hack jokes.  Yeah, we read every instant feedback.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Steve, you have a good morning?  I had a great morning.  Did you do anything today?  Yeah, but in the other room, I'm doing production.  Okay.  Actually.  Very good.  All right.  What?  No new business.  All right.  Oh, he's working on a top secret.  A little snippy.  Something secretive.  He's so snippy today.  A top secret promo, it looks like.  I don't see one flaming thing.  Yeah, you're getting away from the flames.  Let me see your shoes. 
[03:55:00]  Shoes are normal.  Shoes are.  What is.  What's wrong with you?  Um, ironically.  Does someone douse you?  Ironically enough, flaming clothing is not that warm.  Wow, I didn't catch the, uh.  I didn't catch the last part of that.  Uh, those, uh, those flame shirts are not the warmest articles of clothing.  And it is, uh, ironic.  Isn't that ironic?  Yeah.  It's silly.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  I mean.  You get cold in your flaming clothes.  But you're wearing short sleeves now.  I know.  I was.  I know. 
[03:55:30]  I know.  That was an error in judgment on my part.  Like, a boundary music t-shirt is warmer?  I get dressed in the dark.  So, I, you know, I couldn't dig around for a, for a long sleeve shirts.  And I was.  You can't feel the difference in the dark?  What?  I don't understand you get dressed in the dark.  No, locating a long sleeve shirt in the dark is just, it's a little bit challenging.  But you laid out your clothes every night before you went Betty by it.  Doing the light.  No.  Not that fortunate.  Yeah.  I got someone else, you know, in the room trying to sleep when I'm.  You're the man.  Who cares? 
[03:56:00]  I don't want to wake him up.  Please.  All right.  Well, you want to play What Do We Learn?  Or you want to end with a little, uh, little song about Martini Steve?  Uh, it's a very educational, uh, show today.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I say we blow off the What Do We Learn?  All right.  I don't feel like reading today.  Okay.  And we have to talk to the reporter.  Yes, we do.  Have a little interview to do after the show today.  All righty.  So we'll play your song about, uh...  Oh!  Oh!  Martini Steve. 
[03:56:30]  All righty.  We'll end with this today.  We'll be right back. 
[03:57:00]  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  The only buyer's flaming attire.  His clothing's like a barbecue.  His laundry never needs a dryer.  If you're selling burning shoes,  this drunken Lebanese will fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[03:57:30]  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  The only buyer's flaming attire.  You know he's got some flaming shoes.  The kind that Satan would desire.  If you're with him drinking blues.  The smoke detector is required.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[03:58:00]  D&C's clothes are on fire! 
[03:58:30]  That's it, I'm outta here.  I know New York City  Over there  New York City  I know New York City  Oh yeah New York City  The game that was born on the radio now joins the next generation of radio.

[04:01:00]  The problem is you can't go out and see a comedian every night of the week.  You people have got to learn to amuse yourselves.  And I'm going to give you a couple of tips.  Like for instance, the next time you're the lead car in a funeral procession,  make a wrong turn.  Oh, what the heck.  Leave everybody through a car wash.  Hot wax for the bereaved.  My favorite thing.  You can do this any time.  The next time you're in the supermarket, put things in other people's buggy when they're  not looking.  And they get behind them in the checkout line.  I swear you'll see them.  They'll be like this like.  I don't remember getting that.  Then they'll pay for it.  Or if you should ever have to fill out another job application where it says,  nearest relative, put 12 miles. 
[04:01:30]  Or if you should ever have to fill out another job application where it says, nearest relative, put  12 miles.  And they'll get behind them in the checkout line.
